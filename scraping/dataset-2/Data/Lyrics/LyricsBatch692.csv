Come on my dear, step in time
Step in time

Step in time, step in time
Step in time, step in time

Up on the railing
Up on the railing, step in time
Up on the railing, step in time
Never need a reason, never need a rhyme
Up on the railing step in time

Over the rooftops
Over the rooftops, step in time
Over the rooftops, step in time
Never need a reason, never need a rhyme
Step in time

Mary Poppins,"Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious!
Even though the sound of it
Is something quite atrocious
If you say it loud enough
You'll always sound precocious
Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious!

Because I was afraid to speak
When I was just a lassy
My father gave me nose a tweak
And told me I was sassy
But then one day I learned a word
That saved me aching nose
The biggest word I ever heard
And this is how it goes:

Oh, supercalifragilisticexpialidocious!
Even though the sound of it
Is something quite atrocious
If you say it loud enough
You'll always sound precocious
Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious!

So when the cat has got your tongue
There's no need for dismay
Just summon up this word
And then you've got a lot to say
But better use it carefully
Or it can change your life
One night I said it to me guy
And now I am his wife!

She's supercalifragilisticexpialidocious!

Mary Prankster,"Don't give a damn what it's all about
I just wanna see how it all turns out
My mind's skin tight, but my skin's so loose
Everclear is apple juice, I'm swinging on a liquid noose

Get me drunk and get in line
I'm everybody's valentine
Meet me in a few more sips
Kiss my red apocalips

I will never be ignored
I may be a slut, but I'm never bored
I'll go down on anything
Cage that bird and watch her sing

High on life, but it's not mine
Everybody's valentine
Damaged goods all bought and sold
Cunt's cast iron, but my heart's pure gold

Drunk is: opening a wound half-healed
Drunk is: every little fantasy revealed
Drunk is: babble on 'til everybody thinks they see your soul
Drunk is: going from control freak to a freak with no control

Fill my hole with cum and wine
I'm everybody's valentine
This bitter little mouth is my only claim to fame
'Cause once you've given head, nothing ever tastes the same

Drunk is: opening a wound half-healed
Drunk is: every bit of cruelty revealed
Drunk is: turning my shame into my pride
Drunk is: always a bridesmaid, never a bride",Valentine,2000

I'll make this my last drink

Tage im hellen Sonnenschein
Kann nur sie allein uns geben
Nur wer liebt wird niemals einsam sein

Wir warten und wir hoffen und wir träumen
Der Tag vergeht und nimmt die Träume mit
Die Nacht ist lang und du bist nicht mehr bei mir
Doch mein Herz es findet einen Weg zu dir

Alles vergessen und verzeihen
Dann wird wieder dir vergeben
Nur wer liebt wird niemals einsam sein

Nur die Liebe lässt uns leben

Kann nur sie allein uns geben
Nur wer liebt wird niemals einsam sein

Du wirst die Straße deiner Sehnsucht gehen

Wenn man einmal den Schirm vergisst
Triffst du den Traummann
Dann leider genau dann

Sondern immer nur ganz knapp
Wenn man rennend den Türknopf
So grad' noch berühren kann
Fährt sie ab

Da macht man halt nix
Da erzählt nur das Schicksal
Irgendwem einen Witz

Da macht sich nur das Leben
Mit dir einen Spaß
C'est la vie

An alles gedacht
Tausend Pläne gemacht
Und trotzdem geht's dann schief
Sechs richtige haben
Und sich dabei fragen
Warum der Lottoschein
Noch immer hier liegt

Da kommt man einmal
Etwas früher nach Haus
Und hat leider nicht angeklopft
„Es ist nicht das, wonach es aussieht“
Ist es meistens doch

Da erzählt nur das Schicksal

Mary Sarah,"I beg your pardon
I never promised you a rose garden
Along with the sunshine
There's gotta be a little rain some time
When you take you gotta give so live and let live
Or let go oh-whoa-whoa-whoa
I beg your pardon
I never promised you a rose garden

I could promise you things like big diamond rings
But you don't find roses growin' on stalks of clover
So you better think it over
Well if sweet-talkin' you could make it come true
I would give you the world right now on a silver platter
But what would it matter
So smile for a while and let's be jolly
Love shouldn't be so melancholy
Come along and share the good times while we can

I beg your pardon
I never promised you a rose garden
Along with the sunshine
There's gotta be a little rain some time

I beg your pardon
I never promised you a rose garden

I could sing you a tune and promise you the moon
But if that's what it takes to hold you
I'd just as soon let you go
But there's one thing I want you to know
You better look before you leap, still waters run deep
And there won't always be someone there to pull you out
And you know what I'm talkin' about
So smile for a while and let's be jolly
Love shouldn't be so melancholy
Come along and share the good times while we can

The kind that you just want to give away
It's okay to open up
Go ahead and let the light shine through

You want to shut the world out and just be left alone
But don't run out on your faith

'Cause sometimes that mountain you've been climbing
Is just a grain of sand (Is just a grain of sand)
What you've been up there searching for
forever
Is in your hands (Is in your hands)
And when you figure out love is all that matters after all
It sure makes everything else seem so small

It's so easy to get lost inside
A problem that seems so big at the time
It's like a river that's so wide
It swallows you whole
While you sit around thinking about what you can't change
And worrying about all the wrong things
Time's flying by, moving so fast
You better make it count 'cause you can't get it back

By the mountain of fire and the fountain of spit
The pilgrims beside me just talk talk talk
I am the goblin and the mangled hawk

A demon lured me to his bed
Where I fell into a poison sleep
I dreamed of a river of ants inside me
And they were sad and started to bleed

To the things I learned so well in my youth,
I think I'm returning to
The days when I was young enough to know the truth

Now there are no games
To only pass the time
No more coloring books,
No Christmas bells to chime
But thinking young and growing older is no sin
And I can play the game of life to win

When I wasn't afraid to reach out to a friend
And now I think I've got
A lot more than a skipping rope to lift

Now there's more to do
Than watch my sailboat glide
Then everyday can be my magic carpet ride
And I can play hide and seek with my fears,
And live my life instead of counting my years

Mary Travers,"I have these moments
All steady and strong
I'm feeling so holy and humble
The next thing I know
I'm all worried and weak
And I feel myself starting to crumble

The meanings get lost
And the teachings get tossed
And you don't know what
You're going to do next
You wait for the sun
But it never quite comes
Some kind of message
Comes through to you
Some kind of message comes through

And it says to you. . .

Love when you can
Cry when you have to
Be who you must
That's a part of the plan
Await your arrival
With simple survival
And one day we'll all understand

I had a woman
Who gave me her soul
But I wasn't ready to take it
Her heart was so fragile
And heavy to hold
And I was afraid I might break it

Your conscience awakes
And you see your mistakes
And you wish someone
Would buy your confessions
The days miss their mark
And the night gets so dark
And some kind of message
Comes through to you
Some kind of message shoots through --

Love when you can
Cry when you have to
Be who you must
That's a part of the plan
Await your arrival
With simple survival
And one day we'll all understand

There is no Eden or
Heavenly gates
That you're gonna make it to one day
But all of the answers you seek
Can be found
In the dreams that you dream on the way",Part of the Plan,1978
Mary Travers,"Oh, me father was the keeper of the eddystone light
And he slept with a mermaid one fine night
From this union there came three
A porpoise and a porgy and the other was me

Yo ho ho
The wind blows free
Oh for the life on the rolling sea

One day as I was a-trimmin' the glim
Humming a tune from the evening hymn
A voice from the starboard shouted, ""Ahoy""
And there was me mother a-sittin' on the buoy

Yo ho ho
The wind blows free
Oh for the life on the rolling sea

Oh what has become of me children three?
Me mother then she asked of me
One was exhibited as a talking fish
The other was served in a chafing dish

Yo ho ho
The wind blows free
Oh for the life on the rolling sea

Then the phosphorus flashed in her seaweed hair
I looked again, but me mother wasn't there
But I heard her voice echoing back through the night
The devil take the keeper of the eddystone light

Yo ho ho
The wind blows free
Oh for the life on the rolling sea

Oh, the moral of the story you'll learn when you find
To leave God's creatures for what nature had in mind
For fishes are for cookin', mermaids are for tales
Seaweed is for sushi and protecting is for whales

Mary Travers,"Inch by inch, row by row, I'm gonna make this garden grow
All it takes is a rake and a hoe and a piece of fertile ground
Inch by inch, row by row, someone bless these seeds I sow
Someone warm them from below 'til the rain comes tumbling down

Pullin' weeds and pickin' stones, we are made of dreams and bones
I feel the need to grow my own 'cause the time is close at hand
Grain for grain, sun and rain, I'll find my way in nature's chain
I tune my body and my brain to the music of the land

Inch by inch, row by row, I'm gonna make this garden grow
All it takes is a rake and a hoe and a piece of fertile ground
Inch by inch, row by row, someone bless these seeds I sow
Someone warm them from below 'til the rain comes tumbling down

So plant your rows straight and long, temper them with prayer and song
Mother earth can keep you strong if you give her love and care
Now an old crow watching hungrily from his perch in yonder tree
In my garden I'm as free as that feathered thief up there

Inch by inch, row by row, I'm gonna make this garden grow
All it takes is a rake and a hoe and a piece of fertile ground

My poor feet have traveled that hot dusty road
Out of the dust bowl and westward we rolled

I've slept on the ground in the light of your moon
On the edge of your city you've seen us and then
We come with the dust and we go with the wind

California, arizona, I make all your crops
Then north up to oregon to gather your hogs
Pull the beets from your ground, cut the grapes from your vine
To set on your table your light, sparkling wine

Green pastures of plenty from dry desert ground
From the grand coulee dam where the water runs down
Every state in this union us migrants have been
We'll work in your fight and we'll fight til we win

Well it's always we ramble that river and I
All along your green valley I'll work til I die

Cause my pastures of plenty must always be free

Mary Travers,"Saturday summers, when I was a kid
We'd run to the schoolyard and here's what we did
We'd pick out the captains and we'd choose up the teams
It was always a measure of my self esteem

'Cause the fastest, the strongest, played shortstop and first
The last ones they picked were the worst
I never needed to ask, it was sealed,
I just took up my place in right field.

They never did, but still I would pray
That I'd make a fantastic catch on the run
And not lose the ball in the sun
And then I'd awake from this long reverie
And pray that the ball never came out to me
Here in...

[Chorus]

Off in the distance, the game's dragging on,
There's strikes on the batter, some runners are on.
I don't know the inning, I've forgotten the score.
The whole team is yelling and I don't know what for.

Then suddenly everyone's looking at me
My mind has been wandering; what could it be?
They point at the sky and I look up above
And a baseball falls into my glove!

I thought the sun rose in your eyes
And the moon and stars were the gifts you gave

I felt the earth move in my hand
Like the trembling heart of a captive bird
That was there at my command, my love
That was there at my command

Mary Travers,"As he awoke that evening with the smell of wood-smoke clinging
Like a gentle cobweb hangin' upon a painted tepee
He went to see his chieftain with his war lance and his woman
For they told him that the yellow moon would very soon be leaving
""Oh, this I can't believe, ""he said, ""I won't believe our war lord's dead!
He would not leave the chosen ones to the buzzards and the soldiers' guns"" 

Oh, great Father of the Iroquois, ever since I was young
I've read the writing of the smoke and breast-fed on the sound of drums
I've learned to hurl the tomahawk and ride a painted pony wild,
To run the gauntlet of the Sioux, to make a chieftain's daughter mine 

And now you ask that I should watch the red man's race be slowly crushed?
What kind of words are these to hear from Yellow Dog, whom the white man fears? 

I take only what is mine; my pony, my squaw, and my child
I can't stay to see you die, along with my tribe's pride
I go to search for the yellow moon and the fathers of our sons
Where the red sun sinks in the hills of gold and the healing waters run 

Tramplin' down the prairie rose, leaving hoof tracks in the sand
Those who wish to follow me, I welcome with my hand
I heard from passing renegades, Geronimo was dead
He'd been laying down his weapons when they filled him full of lead 

Now there seems no reason why I should carry on
In this land that once was my land I can't find a home
It's lonely and it's quiet and the horse soldiers are comin'
And I think it's time I strung my bow and ceased my senseless running
For now I'll find the yellow moon along with my loved ones
Where the buffaloes graze in the clover fields without the sound of guns
And the red sun sinks at last into the hills of gold
And peace to this young warrior comes with a bullet hole!",Indian Sunset,2008

I would like to say a word or two,

But it's wrong and you know

Let me say it now while the meaning is new
But wouldn't it be good if we could say it together!
Don't be afraid to sing me your mind
Sing about the joy that i know we can find.
Wind them around and see what they sound like together.
The song is love, the song is love,

I pray the Lord my soul to keep
Angels on my left and right
To keep me safe all through the night

There's a place way up high
Starry bright there, through the night there
Close your eyes, let your wishes fly
You'll be in Dreamland by and by

Dimpled and drowsy, off you go
Over the treetops, sliding down a rainbow
Sleepyhead, curl up in your bed
And 'til the sun says, ""Rise and shine""
Sleep warm in Dreamland, baby mine

There's a place worlds away
Time has wings there, green with springs there
Smiles and songs bloom on every tree
Only in Dreamland, just wait and see

Deep down inside us, a child's still there
Wishing for Dreamland, knowing that it's somewhere
Though it may seem so far away

You'll find a Dreamland waiting for you

I've tasted buttermilk, slept through Jurassic Park.
I've taken off my training wheels, used adult shampoo.
Sometimes there's no limit to the scary things I'll do.
I don't hide in the closet when I hear a thunderclap.
I dunk my head in water, I've sat on Santa's lap.
I never bat an eye when I get my measles shot.
So when things get scary, it's a good thing I've got

When I'm in a pinch, I don't even flinch
I'm cool and I'm calm

Bravery, I'm brimming with bravery
I'm always prepared. And if I'm still scared, I get my Mom.

First day at kindergarten, others might have wept.
I sat and played with Legos, At nap time, I just slept.
I climb the tallest jungle gyms, slide the biggest slides.
When I go to Disney World, I ride the biggest rides.
Last Friday at assembly, in front of the whole school,
I played a singing carrot and didn't lose my cool.
I hopped out on that stage, and sang out clear and strong.
In sticky situations, I always bring along...

Three cheers for Bravery.
The sight of a ghost, won't turn me to toast.
I'm better than that.

There's always Dad.

My heart's in my mouth, my nerves heading south,
And I've got the shakes.

Quavery

I swagger and strut.

Maryland Jazz Band,"And now the purple dusk of twilight time
Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb
Always reminding me that we're apart
You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms
The nightingale 
Tells his fairytale
Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain
My stardust melody
The memory of love's refrain.",Stardust,1988

When you're laughing, When you're laughing,

Keep on smiling 'cause when you're smiling,
The whole world smiles with you.

I used to hurry,
Each time it started to rain,
Now I see light,

A little room where all the roses bloom
I want to lead you into Nature's hall
Where ev'ry year the roses give a ball
They have an orchestra up in the trees
For their musicians are the birds and bees
And they will sing us a song
As we are strolling along
 
In sunny Roseland, where summer breezes are playing
Where the honey bees are ""A-Maying""
There all the roses are swaying
Dancing while the meadow brook flows
The moon when shining is more than ever designing
For 'tis ever then I am pining
Pining to be sweetly reclining
Somewhere in Roseland
Beside a beautiful rose
 
The ball is over and tulips meet
Their little kisses are so short and sweet
The lilies nod to the forget-me-nots
When they're departing in their flower pots
But all the roses with their spirits high
Remain to love until they droop and die
And dear, why shouldn't it be
Just so with you and with me
 
In sunny Roseland, where summer breezes are playing
Where the honey bees are ""A-Maying""
There all the roses are swaying
Dancing while the meadow brook flows

Marylee and Nancy,"You know I peeked in to say goodnight,
When I heard my child in prayer
She said, ""And for me some scarlet ribbons,
Scarlet ribbons for my hair"" 

All the stores were closed and shuttered,
And all the streets were dark and bare
In our town, no scarlet ribbons, 
Not one ribbon for her hair

Through the night my heart was aching 
And just before the dawn was breaking, 
I peeked in and on her bed, 
In gay profusion lying there, 
Lovely ribbons, scarlet ribbons
Scarlet ribbons for her hair

I will never, never know from where, 
Came those lovely scarlet ribbons,

I cried a river over you

You drove me, nearly drove me out of my head
While you never shed a tear
Remember, I remember all that you said
Told me love was too plebeian
Told me you were through with me

And now you say you love me
Well just to prove you do

Masakazu Yoshizawa,"Somewhere between Never Neverland and Wonderland
In a land called Never Wonderland
There lived a beautiful wealthy young divorceé
With a checkered past and a bad memory
Who should probably remain nameless

And men traveled from far and wide and try to win her hand
And she took in stragglers from all over the known world
Her newest guests were as her mother called them
""The latest Russians to defect""
One's name was Hefner the other's name was Disney

Disney smoked a pipe and was very philosophical
He was constantly surrounded by go go girls
He used to take pictures of them without any clothes on
And sell them to the neighborhood children

Hefner on the other hand was not so introspective
He loved a good story just like anybody else
In fact he loved the myths of Never Wonderland so much
That he made elaborate molded plastic sculptures
Of the characters in the myths

And then he'd set them out in the garden
Until he had built a whole 'nother land in Never Wonderland
Which he called Hefnerland

The neighborhood children loved them
They had lots of fun playing in Hefnerland
And looking at all Disney's go go pictures
Because they didn't know any better
And they didn't know any worse

But the beautiful, wealthy, young divorceé thought
That they were only after her money
Sometimes she even wished they would go back to Russia
But between you and me they were really dupes of the Wicked King
Who wanted to rob the children of their dreams
",Hefner and Disney,1983
Masakazu Yoshizawa,"It can kill from any distance but you never see it strike
There isn't any warning, no blinding flash of light
It hits you when your back's turned or when your eyes are closed
There isn't any shelter and it cannot be controlled

It can be as subtle as a whisper in the dark
Or as brutal and as cutting as the teeth of a shark

The murder weapon
The murder weapon

There is no good description for the way it makes you feel
It's as lethal as a stiletto and more easily concealed
It sometimes is strategic and sometimes not at all
But you get caught in the fallout, win, lose or draw

There is no escape except to go completely mad
If it doesn't kill you right at first it makes you wish it had

It happened down in Birdland

In the middle of that hub
I remember one jazz club
Where we went to pat feet
Down on 52nd Street
Everybody heard that word
That they named it after Bird
Where the rythym swooped and swirled
The jazz corner of the world
And the cats they gigged in there
Were beyond compare

Birdland, I'm singing Birdland
Birdland, old swingin' Birdland

Hey man, the music really turns you on
Really? Ya turn me around and turn me on

Down them stairs, lose them cares
Where? Down in Birdland
Total swing, Bop was king there
Down in Birdland
Bird would cook, Max would look
Where? Down in Birdland
Miles came through, trane came too there
Down in Birdland
Basie blew, Blakie too
Where? Down in Birdland
Cannonball played that hall there
Down in Birdland, yeah

There will never be nothin' such as that
No more, skoo be wah, no more
Down in Birdland, that's where it was at
I know, ah ah ah ah ah, I know
Back in them days Bop was ridin' high
Hello, heh heh heh heh heh, goodbye!

How well those cats remember their first Birdland gig
To play in Birdland is an honor we still dig
Yeah, that club was like in another world
Sure enough, yeah baby
All those cats were cookin' on
People just sat and they were steady lookin' on
Then Bird, he came and spread the word
Birdland

Yes indeed he did
Yes indeed he did
Yes indeed he did
Yes he did Parker played in Birdland
Yes he really did
Yes indeed he really did told the truth way down in Birdland
Yes indeed he did, Yard bird Parker played in Birdland
Yes indeed he really did, Charlie Parker played in Birdland

Bird named it, Bird made it
Bird heard it, then played it
Well stated Birdland
It happened down in Birdland

Everybody digs be bop
And they'll never stop

Feel my arms around you
How long I have waited
Waited just to love you

Mascara,"It's cost me a lot
But there's one thing that I've got 
It's my man
Cold and wet, tired you bet
But all that I soon forget 
With my man
He's not much for looks 
And no hero out of books 
Is my man
Two or three girls has he 
That he likes as well as me
But I love him! 
I don't know why I should
He isn't good, he isn't true
He beats me too
What can I do?
 
Oh, my man I love him so
He'll never know
All my life is just despair
But I don't care 
When he takes me in his arms 
The world is bright, all right
What's the difference if I say
I'll go away, When I know
I'll come back on my knees some day?
For whatever my man is 
I am his forever more
Oh, my man I love him
 
Sometimes I say 
If I could just get away 
With my man
He'd go straight sure as fate
For it never is too late
For a man
I just like to dream 
Of a cottage by a stream 
With my man
Where a few flowers grew
And perhaps a kid or two
Like my man
And then my eyes get wet
I most forget till he gets hot
And tells me not to talk such rot
 
Oh, my man I love him so
He'll never know
All my life is just despair
But I don't care 
When he takes me in his arms 
The world is bright, all right
What's the difference if I say 
I'll go away, When I know
I'll come back on my knees some day?
For what ever my man is 
I am his forever more",Mon Homme,1996
Mascolo,"Back in Colorado, baby
Seventeen years, we were childish playing
We had time to make good nights
We push back all our problems daily
Polaroid shots in the mountains, baby
We had time to make good nights

And we were high
We had radio love
We said we'd never ever, ever let it go, no
In our mirage
We were perfect as fuck
Making dreams about our lives up in the stars
Yeah yeah babe
Yeah yeah babe

And don't you ever go, don't you ever go, darling
'Cause you're all that I know, you're all that I know
Why did you change your mind and end the night?
And now I'm on my own, now I'm on my own
Maybe I'll call you on the phone, call you on the phone
Or maybe I just won't call 'cause I'm alright
Yeah yeah babe

Someday I'll be patient, baby
Maybe our minds wouldn't be that hazy
We'd have time to make good nights
Look back through our rearview mirror
Saturday lights couldn't get much clearer
We'd have time to make good nights

And we were high
We had radio love
Said we never ever, ever let it go, no
In our mirage

A cold wind's bending the morning
And the backroad bears the pain

See, I leave with a gift of rain

And see two leaves falling
See they kiss, then drift away
And it's true, I really wanted you
And it's true, I really wanted you
Just yesterday

I can see your eyes made for their crying
Like a star was made to shine
My face was meant to bear knowledge
Empty promises, fool lies

See they kiss, then drift away
And it's true, I really wanted you
And it's true, I really wanted you

So let us strike out
Touch the new day
Let our bruises meet there
Like them, the rain has forsaken

Mase,"It was December 24 on hollis after the dark
My man santa saw a rabbi and gave the strangest remark
He said that giving was his living and I had to take part
So I grabbed a bag of goodies and I hopped up on his cart
I laced the pockets of the poor and gave the hoodie a play
Dropped some dollars up on hollis and I went on my way
I hear your jingle Mr. Kringle peep the single, my man
So Santa hit a brotha off and come as quick as you can!

Santa baby
Just slip a benzo under the tree for me
A '98 convertible, light blue
I'm looking for a fly guy, like you
So hurry down the chimney tonight

Now all mase know
When it's eight twenty-four
He be looking at the door for the ho ho ho
'Cause I know
When there's a Christmas uptown
Ain't no chimney for santa to come down

Now to me, pd I had a lot
Appreciated everything that I got
Though I used to take my pops
Who ain't caught me shaking the box
'Cause I knew I couldn't wait till it turned 12 o'clock

Cookies and milk
Satin and silk
I'm chillin in the living room, wrapped in a quilt
I'm waiting on this fat red suit wearing-comparing
My gifts to my homeboy next door to me
A gift here, none there, but who cares
My little sister needs a comb just to braid her nappy hair
But here we go again waiting on the enemy
To slide down the chimney
Look here, that ain't reality

Santa baby
Just slip a benzo under the tree for me
A '98 convertible, light blue
I'm looking for a fly guy, like you
So hurry down the chimney tonight

Santa baby, are you really real?
Chris kringle
Let me see you make my pockets jingle (ching ching)
We need some jobs in the ghetto
Too much gangbanging where kids are playin
I hear the church bells ringing
On Christmas eve
I believe
Jesus-calling me
Forget the gifts and the shopping lists
And the new kicks
Your just falling for tricks
(You better praise him)

Santa baby
Just slip a benzo under the tree for me
A '98 convertible, light blue
I'm looking for a fly guy, like you
So hurry down the chimney tonight

It's the gritty-the grimy
The low down, the shifty
Yo sticky, christmas time in the city
Late night, stars are bright
We gettin rocked!
With the 50 St. Nicholas
Start rippin' this

It's the Grinch who stole Christmas
Climbin' down ya chimney
Kids open up they gifts
They all gonna be empty
Just like mine was
I hate to say it
But if I wasn't a boy I wouldn't have had nuthin to play wit!

On December 25th I knew I wasn't getting jack
When I saw Santa Claus on the corner buying crack
I ran up on him with the Cadillac and asked him ""yo what's up with that? ""
He said ""There ain't no Christmas kid"" and I can't get him back
Back in the days, Christmas was deep
My moms put presents under the tree while I played sleep
And peeped ha! Santa Claus never gave me nuthin
Seen them mad faces, lying and frontin
So do some good to the ghetto, Mr. Chris Kringle
Come and stay awhile, kick it with god's angel
Take and acknowledge my wisdom and understand
That santa claus is a black man
Word up

When you shop should you shop for two
Take you where the waters aqua blue
Let you fall back, treat you like you all that
Under umbrellas with your shades and your straw hat
You ain't the one out clubbin' all day and all night
Just to save a fight you say what's right
And I know he ain't the cat that will stay in your life

How you give a woman 25 a curfew

[Mase] I got to keep on movin 

Quit that! (uh-huh) You a big cat? (yeah) 
Where your chicks at? (yeah) Where your whips at? (where dey at?) 
Wherever you get stacks, I'ma fix that 
Everything that's big dreams, I did that (that's right) 

Don't knock me cause you're boring 
I'm record sales soaring (*whistling*) straight touring 
Simply a lot of men be wantin to hear me 
'Cause their words just don't offend me (uh-uh, uh-uh) 

We spend cheese, in the West Indies 
Then come home to plenty cream Bentleys (ahehe) 
You name it, I could claim it 
Young, black, and famous, with money hangin out the anus 

And when you need a hit, who you go and get? (who?) 
Bet against us? (Not a sure bet) 
We make hits that will rearrange your whole set (that's right) 
and got a Benz that I ain't even drove yet

Mase,"I want you to ask yourself one question
If you had twenty four hours to live, what would you do?  
That's some deep shit right there, a lot of pressure
How would you handle it?
Mase, what would you do?

Yo, I'd turn out all the hoes that's heterosexual
Smack conceited niggas right off the pedestal
I'd even look for my dad that I never knew
And show him how I look in my Beretta, too
I'd do good shit like take kids from the ghetto
Show them what they could have if they never settle
Take every white kid from high class level
Show 'em what Christmas like growin' up in the ghetto
Teach niggas how to spend, stack the rest
Give blunts to the niggas under massive stress
Give every bum on the street cash to invest
And hope Harlem will blow up be my last request

Yo, yo if I had twenty four hours to kick the bucket, fuck it
I'd probably eat some fried chicken and drink a Nantucket
Then go get a jar from Branson
And make sure I leave my mother the money to take care of grandson
Load the three power, hop in the Eddie Bauer
And go give all six to that papi that sold me flour
Get a fresh baldy, make a few calls
Shop at the mall, shoot a lil' ball
Have all of my bitches on one telly at the same time
Spread it out on different floors
And I'm gon' play lotto, for what?
Even though I ain't gon' be here tomorrow, so what

You know when I was close to the ledge
I'd probably be in the wedge
With this bare spanish mami playin' 'tween my legs
Then I'm off to get choke and smoke one a them dreads
And get that bitch from '89 that gave us up to the feds
Thought of momma, wrote her a note, we ain't close
I hate her boyfriend so I put one in his throat
Fuck around and sniff an ounce of raw, bust the four
Fours, pull out my dick and take a piss on the floor
Jump in the whip, git them cats I wanted to git
Since the Tavern on the Green robbery in eighty-six
Went home took a shower in nice cold water
And spent my last hours wit my son and my daughter

If you had twenty four hours to live just think
Where would you go?
What would you do?
Who would you screw?
And who would you wanna notify?
Or would yo' ass deny that yo' ass about to die?

If you had twenty four hours to live just think
Where would you go?
What would you do?
Who would you screw?
And who would you wanna notify?
Or would yo' ass deny that yo' ass about to die?

What hey yo, if I had twenty four nigga gotta get the raw
Run all them papi's spot, put one in his head at the door
For the times that I paid for twenty an he gave me twelve
The other eight had to be baking soda by itself
So papi fuck you, you dead now, I'm off to the bank
With those bricks in a bookbag and a stolen Jag I just grabbed
Went in there grabbed the bank teller wit the pretty face
Fuck her in the safe, and have her take me to my place
We'll make a kid but that's selfish and that'll be bad
For my son to have the same shit his pops just had
And when I'm down to twenty three, I'm a be strapped wit TNT
Run up in city hall and take the judges wit me

If I had twenty four hours to live, I'd probably die on the fifth
Run in the station squeezin the inf'
I'll be waitin' to get to hell and bust down Satan
Styles' on this shit and I got spot vacant
Back to the twenty four I make it out the precinct
Shootin niggas that I hate in they face while they eatin'
I'm on the job robbin' every so-called Don
Give the money to my moms and tell her that I'm gone
I would school my little brother that niggas mean him harm
He should learn to tell the future without readin' palms
When they come in with the bullets, you prepared with the bomb
So fuck bein' violent get stocks and bonds

Twenty four left until my death
So I'm gon' waste alot of lives, but I'll cherish every breath
I know exactly where I'm goin', but I'mma send you there first
And with the shit that I'll be doin', I'mma send you there worse
I've been livin' with a curse, and now it's all about to end
But before I go, say hello to my little friend
But I gots to make it right, reconcile with my mother
Try to explain to my son, tell my girl I love her
C-4 up under the coat, snatch up my dog
Turn like three buildings on Wall Street, into a fog
Out with a bang, you will remember my name
I wanted to live forever, but this wasn't fame

If you had twenty four hours to live just think
Where would you go?
What would you do?
Who would you screw?
And who would you wanna notify?
Or would yo' ass deny that yo' ass about to die?

If you had twenty four hours to live just think

Yo, if you gonna hit niggaz girl just expect niggaz to hit your girl 
And that's it 
112 help me say 

[Chorus] 
If she got with you when she already had a man 
Why wouldn't she cheat on you 
Why wouldn't she cheat on you 
If she got with you when she already had a man 
Why wouldn't she cheat on you 
Why wouldn't she cheat on you 

Mase come on 
If I'm in the streets or I'm in my jeep 
And I wit my peep, ex know not to speak 
See it's all good, and it's all sweet 
All women flirt, all women cheat 
So I might spend a week down in Virginia Beach 
Out of inner sheets blaze plenty freaks 
Be the bad boy everybody want to meet 
Practice what I preach, never caught when I cheat 
If I didn't work late, I say I was wit my peeps 
And quick to tell a hoe, yo I didn't get the beep 
And all these girls is quite the same 
So it ain't your pencil, it's how you write your name 

[Chorus] 

Ain't nobody hotter than the jam, don dada 
Been around the world with girls at Ramada 
Never been the wanted chick, lotta scotta, protta 
And yo when Cease got a girl he gotta 
Though I love to get a girl that keep her doobie fly 
39 in my Benz them niggaz and super size them 
Girl talk slick but I see through the lies 
You don't got TV, whatcha mean who am I 
If I knew what you knew, you wouldn't be givin the pearls 
If you know that she cheat why you live with the girl 
Have your cats come live in my world 
Cause you couldn't picture another nigga hittin your girl

Is it because my game is stronger, name last longer
On the brain like a whole eighth became 
Chicks out mesmerize rub up on they tetas 
Like push up bras, who you dealin with ma, it's jigga 
You know the rawest, ice is flawless baby 
Nice is lawless, recite for ballest 
And I fools y'all fake players every time 
Cause you only hit chicks that you think is mine 
You know I paid his due, but I'm unfatable 
Mommi screamin pappi can I skate wit you 
They want to ride wit me, stay fly wit me 
Want to help me get rid of my rivalries 
Want to be the ebony to my ivory 
But I'm straight though, thanks ma, I only chase doe 
We can lay for tonight but in the mornin 
I get Shirley Murrdock, I hope your door slam lock, I'm gone

Mase,"Uh, uh, come on, uh 
It be the same cats that wouldn't listen to my demo 
Now I want they ass in my limo 'cause now I'm a sex symbol 
Intercontinental, L.A. airplay, just like Jay Leno 
Now all the labels out want to send a memo 
To do a remix y'all, but Mase say N-O 
Figure once I make it, they'll fake it 
And ain't nobody show me love when I was naked 
And when he threw my tape in the trash, I laughed 
Now a nigga' tape on blast, I laugh 
Figure as days pass, make more cash 
And I push everything from E to H-class  
Four years ago couldn't go to a show 
I was standin' on the corner sellin' dope for dough 
Now I no longer hope I'll blow, smoke my droll 
On a yacht, nigga fuck a boat that row

Do you want to get money with us, do you want to? 
Do you want to get money with us, do you want to? 

Yo, the reality of it all, everybody can't ball 
If you had currency, you wouldn't be worryin' 'bout me 
But see, I could go the whole summer, gold Hummer 
But I'd rather go Lex bubble, 'cause it's less trouble 
Make my dough and I just stack, no investment 
I live off just that 
Money, hoes, and clothes, and shit that I'm best at 
But I'm a Bad Boy so you gotta expect that 
Why do what most do? Do what you 'possed to 
Make hot jams y'all, sell bicoastal 
If you want a hit you can let me coach you 
Money back on anything that got my vocals 
This is so true, I do what pros do 
'Cause broke ain't a state that I'm tryin' to go through 
Dealers give me credit any place I go to

I'm not here to replace Notorious 
I'm just a young cat tryin' to do his thing

Messin' with me shorty, you'll be a-ight 
Stop listen' to all them cats on the block

Yo what up dud 
Remember that girl you said was nineteen somethin' 
Yeah I remember that shorty 
She was not nineteen 
Word! Yes she is she nineteen 
Nigga I followed her to school that's how I know 
Nigga I followed her to school you know I don't be into that 
Dog  dog  she showed me some ID bee word up 
Niggaz got to jail for that 
Lot a niggaz go to jail 
See you not a regular nigga right there, I know I know 
Her friend ain't want to give me the pussy 
You want to know what that bitch said to me 
What happened?  

I really want to mess wit you 
But I ain't ready to have sex wit you 
And I don't mind caressing on you 
But I need to be, I need to be 
You know I need to be loved by you 
You know I need to be hugged by you 
And I can't wait to be touched by you 
'Cause I need to be, 'cause I need to be 

How many niggas out remember the 
First time they try to take a girl virginity 
And through the bullshit, you lost your identity, and lost your cool 
'Cause you ain't know what to tell all your niggas at school 
I had niggas making bets like, did he fuck her yet? 
Ask her did he touch her bra, when I say nah they say ah
So tomorrow I use that pressure to undress her 
But the more I caress her, more I feel like a molester 
So I wait for the day deserve it 
But every time I go to touch it, then she say I hurt it 
I can't even talk sex, and then she say I'm perverted 
And then she say, Mase. why we can't wait? What, I ain't worth it? 
It ain't that but girl you never say I go too fast 
All I'm seatin' when I'm eating, or goin' in your ass 
I guess you like that, huh 
 
Now mother may I? Yes you may 
I told her 'bout all the baddest bitches from Harlem to LA 
Now anything that Mase can blaze, gotta get away 
See girl, work is work and baby, when I'm workin' I get paid 
For overnight stays that's gonna cost you breakfast on trays 
No need for shower curtains, we bath in camays 
I live the willie life 'cause that's the style that I portray 
We pop crystal like my niggas got a raise 
See nowadays man you got to know these bitches age 
'Cause they ass be real fast when they be goin' through that phase 
You fuck a girl that's young, and you gonna end up in the cage 
'Cause her moms ain't tryin' to hear that you never knew her age 
And naughty is the only way that Bad Boy plays 
Fuck them hoes, have them girls recoverin' for days 
A nigga like me, I have a girl head in a daze 
And I never eat pussy 'cause I'm too stubborn in my ways, come on 

I need to be licked from my head to my feet 
To make a long story short, girl I need me a freak 
She can be fat, black, light skin, type slim 
Matter fact shorty ain't even got to like me 
As long as when she grab my meat, she take it down real deep 
Till her body feel weak, then I'm fallin' asleep 
See I ain't talkin' 'bout these pre-madonna bitches you meet 
I need a girl that if I ask her handle me and my peeps 
Get down dirty, and lick ice down my butt cheeks 
Then she wiggle, then I giggle, then she feel my nutsy 
Then if she give my dick a kiss, probably give her clit a kiss 
Then I hit it from the back, then I yell whose shit is this 
Then I go so hard that she need her guts fixed 
If she make my nuts itch, I kill that slut bitch 
I done been around the world, uh huh, and never met a girl 
That's so thorough that could suck a dick until my toes curl, uh huh",I Need to Be,1997

Can't a young man get money anymore? 
Let my pants sag down to the floor 
Really do it matter as long as I score? 
Can't my car look better than yours? 
Can I have a bad bitch without no flaws 
Come to see me without no drawers
In a stretch Lex with about ten doors? 
How is murder? 
P. Diddy name me pretty 
Did it for the money, now can you get with me? 
People wanna know who is he, he get busy 
Spray so much izzy, girls get dizzy

Dissin' every gear, but they better listen here 
You cats keepin' it real, you cats is on yo own 
Cuz bein' broke and alone is something I can't condone 
Plus it won't be long till they send me the dome
Sit gently, while I'm on the Bentley phone 
Why you don't like me? 
Cuz I'm mad fly and icy? 
And why you can't satisfy yo wifey 
And if it wasn't for this Bad Boy exposure 
CD, TV's, really would I know ya

Make it hot baby, make it hot (come on)
Make it hot baby, make it hot (come on)
Make it hot baby, make it hot (come on)
We don't stop

We was all at the Greek fest, it's hot and sandy 
I rent scooters,  I'm with my family 
Tank top, flip flop, really nothing fancy 
But get approached by a girl named Tammy 
Who looked good enough to be Miss Miami 
But say, since some her peeps call her Candy 
Than she starts to ask about Aaliyah and Brandy 
Tellin' me how she met Puff down at the Grammy's 
He ain't tell you I was the one with no panties? 
Boo, you know how many he meet with no panties? 
Please, tell me something that I don't know 
Like if we have sex, you don't want dough
And if it's not a problem you can meet me at 10 
I'll be in room 112 and bring four friends 
And if you gon' hit me, it gotta be a quickie 
And please no hickies, cuz wifey's with me

Get my daily menage, Halle Berry massage 
Different color Benz in every garage 
Who would've thought? '95, earth spinned twice

Need about three pages in caller ID 
When I come around, all the waitress get tippo

Leave the restroom about six strippers 
Don't watch me, flip up your zipper 
I'ma good fellow, mellow 
Though I puff trees my teeth never yellow 
Hello, in the club jingle like I'm Jello 
With the kids, big as Tickle Me Elmo

I think I should warn you
I get hard when I want to
Angelettie, Bad Boy, niggas ain't ready

Yo, you the type of cat in the building holdin' the cracks
Playin' son to the niggas on the corner holdin' the gatts
Nigga come through, a nigga kill, never blow back
You the nigga never did but send in all the facts
Yo, I know niggas like you cuz I meet 'em all the time
And I greet 'em with the 9 if they ever keep what's mine
If I lose I get loc, put a fool in the yoke
Two to his throat, take his jewels and his coat
More than likely, you ain't got to like me
And this might be the last time I take you nicely
For my legion, fill up the season and start squeezin'
Niggas talkin' shit, be behind the cars weavin'
There's no breathin', ain't nobody in here leavin'
You kill my man, I kill your bitch, now we even
I'm from a cold world, where it's bleeding 20 degrees in
Fahrenheit, niggas get sniped for no reason
Do a lot of work, got plenty funds and many guns
Many sons, niggas do anything to anyone
And on the streets I don't doubt nuttin'
So when you talk to Mase better watch yo mouth son

Yo, if niggas wanna act we can act
You niggas wanna scrap, we could scrap
You niggas got gatts, we got gatts
You niggas wanna style, we style
If you get foul, we get foul
You get wild, we get wild

If niggas wanna scrap, we could scrap
You niggas got gatts, we got gats
You niggas wanna style, we style
If you get foul, we get foul
You get wild, we get wild

Yo, started with a blue whip, got a silver new whip
Cuz feds watch when I do shit, keep poppin' up new shit
Keep the whole Harlem World on some Clue shit
We crisp bub sippers, strip club niggas
Peace to the street team, ya'll get love niggas
Six years ago I was the have-not nigga
Hot nigga, represent for all my block niggas
Now I'm 6 drop niggas, baggette rock niggas
10 G's a show and I ain't even drop niggas
Shock niggas who thought I was a pop nigga
You go against Mase you get your wig rocked nigga!
Players like me'll leave your whole block bitter
Roll hard like when I see the bank stop nigga
Hustle is a hustle, so I never knock a nigga
Don't really fuck with Dame, but still I copped Jigga

Yo, if niggas wanna act we can act
You niggas wanna scrap, we could scrap
You niggas got gatts, we got gatts
You niggas wanna style, we style
If you get foul, we get foul
You get wild, we get wild

Yo, I do this everyday, why brag about the glory?
Tell you the whole truth, never half the story
You wasn't no hater, you'd probably be happy for me
Billboard first slot in every category
Niggas say they love me, they don't love me
I know deep down they wanna slug me
I feel the vibe when they hug me
Luckily I rock jewels that be chuckie
Over Iceberg Rhugby, pushin' a Benz buggey
For a better batch, roll fever for notes
And need I approach little niggas seated in coach
I mean, um, think it's smaller than the weed in my roach
The seed in my smoke, the niggas ain't cheap, they broke
Oh yeah, this my dough year
Jealousy and envy'll get you nowhere
You don't like me, bet against me
You right, got dough do whatever you like
I get front row seats on the night of the fight
My Roley too tight, how many link, loosen my ice
And 'for I scoop the dice, bet a grand I beat the duece twice
Niggas who don't make dough, I can affil'ate with 'em
I'm dyin' from a sickness known as Willie-ism

",Puff's Intro,1997
Mase,"Yo, I be that young fly fellow, got thorough
Down for denaro, hit everything in the Triburo
And I'm the newest member of the Bad Boy team
And I'mma bring this nigga Puff mad more C.R.E.A.M.
With hooks galore, leave this city shook for short
And I'mma take 'em back where Biggie took 'em before
You stay a playa'
Since you can't stay up with the Pope
And stick to what you do best, stick to wearin' coke
You lookin' for excuses, ways to say you're broke
Can't keep a whip, cuz you can't pay the note
Fuck the side, I'm waiting for you on top, Mercedes drop
Black 380's cops, 'till the day I get knocked
All I ask when I die, dress me fly and neatly
And brush my waves so I'm handsome when the bitches greet me
Word from the wise, niggas jerk pies, we hurt them guys
Bust lead, to skin they head and leave them circumcised
So how you wanna settle this?
Rappin' or on some ghetto shit
We can do it yo way, with mics or with metal shit

Niggas wanna shout, I'mma make noise
Niggas run they mouth, I'mma break jaws
Mase is comin' out, we gon' take yours
Harlem World uptown baby, we make wars
Niggas wanna shout, I'mma make noise
Niggas run they mouth, I'mma break jaws
Mase is comin' out, we gon' take yours
Harlem World uptown baby, we make wars

Yo, yo before it's all over, lot of blood gon' be spilled
We ain't discriminatin' even thugs gon' be killed
We early inheritors , born into C.R.E.A.M
If a nigga' get sheist then we form as a team
Bullshit if you want and it be on for this C.R.E.A.M.
The weatherman don't even know the storm I'mma bring
But yo, I'm not the man with whom you interact
So before you grab gatts to jack, remember that
You take dough from Mase, you might as well send it back
I got thugs everywhere, where you going spending that
When clicks come to brawl, everything I hit fall
Niggas play sick wid y'all, wit me they ain't sick at all
No matter how big or small, I get rid of ya'll
And shit I spit at y'all, come in one size fit all

Niggas wanna shout, I'mma make noise

Mase is comin' out, we gon' take yours
Harlem World uptown baby, we make wars

Yo, yo if you think I'm on some sweet shit
Then won't you creep quick, I let the heat spit
Make a nigga ""G"" flick, classic criminal
Keep a gatt by my genitals, thugs love me
So don't get splashed for the minimal
We never vest up, be in a double breast tux
Plus keep a fresh cut, picture me getting lefts stuff
I let one lose, to show you I ain't the one do
And I ain't puffin' nuthin', make all my gun shoot
You let your gun loose, none o' 'em niggas gun proof
Watch them niggas drop, when I pop one in they sunroof
And we be lead bustin', leavin' niggas head gushin'
You niggas talkin' 'bout guns like you said something
I'll be lacin' 'em, hollow tips, I be wastin' 'em
That's what you faggots get, tryin' to fuck with Mase and 'em
Bad Boy, '97, front, there'll be none o' that
And all you cats, running your trap, one in your cap

I got power, make a call, get a mil' in cash
Like my money and ya ain't cuz they don't tax me
Actually, anything you got to ask me, fax me
I'm no Beamer dreamer, I'm a Bentley man
Car totally smashed threw out 50 grand
How ya figure ya bigger when Mase that nigga
And every style I deliver come with much charisma
Knock it off, now will ya , I'm the one that bitches live for
Don't get me wrong you niggas make it hot I make it sizzler

Time is money, when you talk gotta be quick

But I know how it is when ya go into the bar
Got girls overreact, they thowin' you a star 
Got niggas player hatin' don't even know who you are
And go as far as leavin' bullet holes in yo' car
When you're from Harlem World niggas never see yo' views
They wait for you to flop or be on BET News
All they see the G's and jewels, V's that ya cruise
Being the underdogs, they can't wait to see us lose
Don't hate me, thank me
I don't get mad when nigga's bitches prank me
Make you cranky to see me places that you can't be
I'm too pretty to let you niggas shank me 
And frankly, know you probably hate me cause you ain't me

Mase,"Uh, uh, come on, uh 
It be the same cats that wouldn't listen to my demo 
Now I want they ass in my limo cuz now I'm a sex symbol 
Intercontinental, L.A. airplay, just like Jay Leno 
Now all the labels out wanna send a memo 
To do a remix ya'll, but Mase say N-O 
Figure once I make it, they'll fake it 
And ain't nobody show me love when I was naked 
And when he threw my tape in the trash, I laughed 
Now a nigga' tape on blast, I laugh 
Figure as days pass, make more cash 
And I push everything from E to H-class  
Four years ago couldn't go to a show 
I was standin' on the corner sellin' dope for dough 
Now I no longer hope I'll blow, smoke my droll

Yo, the reality of it all, everybody can't ball 
If you had currency, you wouldn't be worryin' 'bout me 
But see, I could go the whole summer, gold Hummer 
But I'd rather go Lex bubble, cuz it's less trouble 
Make my dough and I just stack, no investment 
I live off just that 
Money, hoes, and clothes, and shit that I'm best at 
But I'm a Bad Boy so you gotta expect that 
Why do what most do? Do what you 'possed to 
Make hot jams ya'll, sell bicoastal 
If you want a hit you can let me coach you 
Money back on anything that got my vocals 
This is so true, I do what pros do, 
Cuz broke ain't a state that I'm tryin' to go through 
Dealers give me credit any place I go to 
Drive out in the Benz say ""Let Mase owe you'""

I'm not here to replace Notorious 
I'm just a young cat tryin' to do his thing

The things that went 3 mil, I didn't even like that 
You say you got mad hoes, well we'll see tonight
Mase be the cat that'll lead you to the light 
Messin' with me shorty, you'll be a-ight 
Stop listen' to all them cats on the block 
That tellin' you that Mase don't rock 
Cuz Mase is hot and Mase got a drop and a yacht and a big knot
To move you and your moms off the block 
For real though, Mase got real dough
That be in briefcases cats kill fo' 
And since you can't beat us, it's best you join us

You ready Mase?
Party people
In the place to be
It's about that time
For us to
Yeah, uh-huh

First Verse:
Yo, what you know about goin out?
Head wet, red Lex
TV's all up in the headrest
Try and live it up
Ride into
Bigger truck
Peace all
Glittered up
Sticker kid
Nigga what? Jig with the cut
Sip Cris, spit it up
Hoes ride, get your nut
Till I can't get it up
I'm a big man, give this man room
I'ma hit everything, from Cancun to man's tomb
Why you standin' on the wall?
Hangin' on your balls
Lighting up drugs
Always fightin' in the club
I'm the reason they made the dress code
They figure I wouldn't wild when I'm in my French clothes
Dress as I suppose, from my neck to my toes
Neck full of gold, but gets in my Rolls
Reck shows, collect those, extra O's
Buy an E, get a key, to the Lex
To hold, East, West, every state
Come on, bury the hate
Millions the only thing
We in the area to make
Better friend or ex-friend
In a Lex or a Benz
Let's begin
Bring this BS to an end
Come on

Chorus:
Bad, bad, bad, bad boy
You make me feel so good
You know you make me feel so good
You know you make me feel so good

Bad, bad, bad, bad boy
I wouldn't change you if i could
I wouldn't change you if i could
I wouldn't change you if i could

Verse Two:
You can't understand, we be
Ride kinky, sippin' DP
To the TV, look greedy
Little kids see me, way out in DC
With a Z3, chrome VB's
They want to be me
Nigga's talkin' shit
They ought to quit
I'm fortunate
They don't see a fourth what I get
And those be the same ones walkin' while I whip
Just started seing cars
Cause they alternate
So while you daydream
Mama's city gleam
And I deal with hoes
That pose
In Maybeline
One time you had it all
I ain't mad at ya'll
Now give me the catalog
I'll show you how daddy ball
Six cars in power
The five big stars
Phillip, see, O, Chaz smokin' on cigars
Nigga
It's like ya'll
Be talkin' funny
I don't understand language
In people with short money
Come on

Chorus

Verse Three:
Do Mase got the ladies? Yeah, yeah
Do Puff drive Mercedes? Yeah, yeah
Take hits from the 80's? Yeah, yeah
But do it sound so crazy? Yeah, yeah
Well me personally
It's nuthin' personal
I do what work for me
You do what work for you
And I dress with what I was blessed with
Never been arrested
For nuthin domestic
And I chill
They way you met me
With a jet ski
Attached to a SE
Smoke my Nestle
No mad rap
Ask Cat
Where my check be?
Problem with ya'll
I say it directly
Went from hard to sweeps
Started to eat
From no hoes at shows
To manaj in suites
Now I be the cat
That be hard to meet
Gettin' head from girls
That used to hardly speak
Come on

Mase,"Yo yo this Mase, you know what I'm saying
You got niggas that don't like me for whatever reason
You got niggas that don't wanna see me rich
You got niggas that's mad 'cause I'm always with they bitch
Then you got niggas that just don't like me
You know the, those PHD niggas
but you know I pop a lot of shit but I back it up though see it's a difference,
a lot of niggas pop shit
But a lot of niggas don't make hits
But it's like this whole Bad Boy shit we come to bring it to y'all niggas,
Me, B.I., Puff, Lox, whoever, Black Rob
If you wanna dance, we dance

Now trick what, Lace who
That ain't what Mase do got a lot of girls that'd love to replace you
Tell you to your face boo not behind your back
Niggas talk shit, we never mind that
Funny never find that, Puff a dime stack, write hot shit
And make a nigga say, rewind that
Niggas know, we go against the Harlem Gigolo
Getcha ho, lick her low, make the bitch hit the door
I represent honeys with money fly guys with gems
Drive with the tints that be thirty-five percent
Hoes hope I lay so I look both ways
Cop says okay my tint smoke gray No way, nigga leave without handing me my shit
Got plans to get my Land and my six
Niggas outta pen'll understand this shit
Pop champagne like I won a championship

Been around the world and I I I
And we been playa hated
I don't know and I don't know why
Why they want us faded
I don't know why they hate us
Is it our ladies
Or our drop Mercedes
Baby, baby

I was in one bedroom, dreaming of a million
Now I'm in beach houses, cream to the ceiling
I was a gentleman living in tenements
Now I'm swimming in all the women that be tens
Went from Bad Boys to the Crushed Linen Men
Now my divi-dends be the new Benjamins
Hoes of all complexions, I like cinnamon
Mase you got some hoes well nigga send em in
What you waiting for, let the freak show begin
How they came in a truck? (Nah Puff, that's a Benz)
Mercedes, c'mere baby, you don't like the way it's hot and hazy,
Never shady, you must be crazy
It's ridiculous how you put your lips on this
Don't kiss right there girlfriend I'm ticklish
And I be switching fees with a wrist full of G's, nigga please,
I'm the macaroni with the cheese

Been around the world and I I I
And we been playa hated
I don't know and I don't know why
Why they want us faded
I don't know why they hate us
Is it our ladies
Or our drop Mercedes
Baby, baby

Now Puff rule the world even though I'm young
I make it my biz to see that all ladies come
Get 'em all strung from the tip of my tongue
Lick em places niggas wouldn't dare put they faces
Before I die, hope I, remake a flow by
In the brand new treasure on a old try
Now when my throat dry, even when the smoke lie
Eat the Mami chocha and drive her loca
We never ride far, packed five in a car
Save money for the drinks, I'm about to buy the bar
And everywhere I drive I'm a star
Little kids all on the corner scream, that's my car
It was days couldn't be fly, now I'm in a T.I
Come in clubs with B.I., now a nigga V.I
Rock tons of gold, enough money I fold
Roll the way you wanna roll, break a hundred at the toll

Been around the world and I I I
And we been playa hated
I don't know and I don't know why
Why they want us faded
I don't know why they hate us
Is it our ladies
Or our drop Mercedes

Though I'm never drugged, I'm the venom in the club, G
Though I know the thug be wantin' to slug me (uh-huh)
Could it be I move as smoove as Bugsy? (yeah)
Or be at the bar with too much bubbly? (c'mon)
Yo I think it must be the girls want to lust me
Or is it simply the girls just love me
Brothers wanna, rock the Rolls, rock my clothes
Rock my ice, pull out glocks, stop my life (uh)
I'm like, ""Damn, how these niggas got they trust?
Used to be my man, how you gonna plot on my wife?""
Do you think you snake me, cause they hate me?
Or he got his Ph.D; Player Hater's Degree? (Ahaha!)

Can't nobody take my pride, can't nobody hold me down oh no
I got to keep on movin'

Where your chicks at? (where) Where your whips at? (where dey at?)
Wherever you get stacks, I'ma fix that
Everything that's big dreams, I did that (that's right)
Don't knock me cause you're boring
I'm record sales soaring straight touring
Simply a lot of men be wantin' to hear me
'Cause their words just don't offend me (uh-uh, uh-uh)
We spend cheese, in the West Indies
Then come home to plenty cream Bentleys (hehe)
You name it, I could claim it
Young, black, and famous, with money hangin' out the anus
And when you need a hit, who you go and get? (who?)
Bet against us? (Not a sure bet)
We make hits that'll rearrange your whole set (that's right)

The way that he does
Give me the chance to show you baby
You're better off with me
Oh so baby let me try, I wanna make you smile
I wanna love you like you need to be loved
I'll never let you down, I'll always be around
And you should be mine

If he don't love you right, don't waste your time
If he don't treat you like you should, then you should be mine

I know you're used to dealing with cats with real money
Also know you like Mase in alot of ways
But it's hard to go on when your lonely on the holidays
When you shop should you shop for two
Take you where the waters aqua blue
Let you fall back, treat you like you all that
Under umbrellas with your shades and your straw hat
You ain't the one out clubbin' all day and all night
Just to save a fight you say what's right
And I know he ain't the cat that will stay in your life
Even though he gave you ice that'll make you his wife
How a man deserve you if he hurt you
How you give a woman 25 a curfew
Between me and you, you ain't heard that from me

If you see jewels that's the rocks on my neck

If you feel different, I'm stoppin' the bet

If you think your a nasty girl
Your man had you livin' in a fantasy
But it's really Cam'Ron's world

And bring four more girls (bring 'em all)

With the six chromed out in pearl

And yo, you know my style when we creepin' too
Yo, who that boo, your man beepin' you
Well say your wit Lexis, with the Lexus
God damn yo, I just missed the exit

My whole comity like to puff L's and look jiggy
Who wan' test this? My semi leave you chestless
And ain't shit that you can say to me when you be breathless
Young, but I done did shit that you won't do
So go ahead with the bullshit you blab about going through

Who sit next to you? Protecting you?
But they'll murder you, player

Any nigga make it hot, get found in vacant lot
You don't really wanna come try, the one guy
Who stay dumb high from blunt lye
The rack of sing-sing alumni
Who got more beef than a Islamic farm
So I pack enough sonic arms to neutralize atomic bombs
It's not a nigga in your gang want it
My AK slay gays, spray strays with niggas names on it
Often I bug, then we'll soften a thug
Have a chump coughing blood, fill his coffin with slugs
Yo, you know I got enough guns to wreck a nation
Any nigga wave a Tec at Mase, and, have a explanation
You bring your crew and 'em and I'm doing 'em
Then I'm beating 'em down with aluminum
Then I'm putting two in 'em
You can't touch me, I've been devil sent, wanted for embezzlement
A lot of other things, but that's irrelevant

Cleaning my Tommy, showing love to my army
Whenever The Lox find rippy blocks, we kill 'em
Yeah I hear niggas, but I still don't feel 'em
And this for the listeners, and prisoners
And them jealous rap cats that prefer dissing us
My 16's be so real, you can feel 'em in your vain
Like Ramello's pops from Sugarhill
J be the 'cause for the kiss at your wake
Cartel lips, spitting clips at your face
We started from the bottom
You'll see beg niggas pardon, whatever
We can do it at the Garden
Word life, this shit is real big
I'm making niggas blow trial even if they not guilty

I want a palace for my thugs, with oriental rugs
Green backs from drugs, get whacked for the love
Twenty niggas batter me, still couldn't shatter me
I'm only getting up, splitting up your anatomy
Official lock family, grants niggas handing me
I want the finer things, and I hope you understanding me
Sitting at the table, planning and plug the fan in
Let the sweat dry off and then grab your cannon

Don't came at me with no bullshit, use caution
'Cause when I wet shit, I dead shit, like abortions
For bigger portions, of extortion then racketeering
Got niggas fearing, fuck what you heard, this what you hearing
How much darker must it get, how much harder must it hit
See if your hardest niggas flip, when I start a bunch of shit
I like pussy, but not up in my face, so gimme three feet
'Cause when we creep, no more than three deep, niggas see sheep
Bloodhounds found your shit buried in the mud
Following traces of gun powder, residue and blood
A positive ID is impossible, so you know
John Doe is what they gon' be putting on that tag on yo' toe
Now who gon' tell yo mother, her baby's under a cover in the morgue
Stiff as a log, sniffed out by the dogs
Son of a hard headed nigga that wouldn't listen
So you got what you came for
What's that?

Surgery with the chainsaw, I hit the fucking streets
'Cause like I said before ain't nothing going down until I eat
Motherfuckers think it's all about impressing bitches and stressing bitches
Well, I'm testing bitches game, addressing bitches, and caressing bitches
And dealing with motherfuckers on all levels
What I'm dealing with is all devils, fucking with snakes
Running wit niggas you call rebels
I got an army of 730 niggas, dirty niggas
That come through and worry niggas
30 niggas that like to bury niggas
And scary niggas get it all the time
'Cause what they got is all of mine
Your man was talking shit until I pulled the nine
And if I don't know you, I don't fuck with you
And if you with my man, then he getting stuck with you
And gave it the money
'Cause I just lost my mind when he crossed the line
Sent his back through his chest
Then I tossed the nine, boss of crime

Here is where you want to be 

If you want me

Where do all of your emotions go 

Cause I don't feel your arms holding me 

And when it gets cold at night 

And my body is warm 

Don't you know that I'm all that you need 



[Bridge] 

Cause I just want to be with you 

Whenever you want me to 

And anything that you ask 

I would do 

And baby I hope you understand 

That I got feelings 

When all of my feelings are just being used 



[Repeat Chorus] 



[Pam] 

I'll be your emotions as they fall in the wind 

I am more then you say 

Your warm desire within 

I'll be your emotions as they fall in the wind 

I am more then your heart's best friend

You're being my friend 'gain 

We're making sweet love 

We're making sweet love babe 

It's sweeter then morning dew 

You know I'm so into you 

There's no other touch 

And it hurts me so much

Come on come on

What you think hun, Ma$e be young, Ma$e be dumb 

Get Ma$e strung, there'll be no pre-numb? 

But ever since B.I.G. died, my life's changed 

Got the blue, I'm your boo, that's quite strange 

I get nice thangs, way out the price range 

And half these girls, don't even know my right name 

See a fly rollie, mink made of coyote 

Love a ghetto chick, I know she died for me 

You got me confussed, see Cam the freak 

Ma$e never the playa, bring sand to the beach 

I'm sumthin' that the average girl hand couldn't reach 

Living expenses, 20 grand a week 

You know me, I be O-T, low key 

Platnuim rollie, smokin' a O-Z 

I'm that babyfaced playa, without no goatee 

2 point 8, and about to go 3

Fuckin' with my dough is like fuckin' with my pride
& fuckin' with my hoes is like fuckin' with my high

Now I know you love my lazy flow
But here come my crazy flow
Do this shit 'cause it make me dough
Do it again to make me more

Top down 64 radio AC blow
They peep though think that automatically
'cause this nigga roll with Puff Daddyo
He gotta be ridin' in a be	-E-N-T-L-E but why?
Cause you see a young nigga like me out doing it
Want to come & put ya two in it
Want to ruin it see me pursuin' it
& want to spend what's mine
First you wouldn't give me the time
Now you gotta get in line
Think that Mase gon' trick a dime
You out ya fuckin' mind
See I'm bout it bout it now is you with it with it?
Bitch I don't care how you get ya dough you get it get it
Now you can't claim to be a pimp & then go be committed
Just like you hit it hit it man another nigga don' hit it

Hoes know to fuck with me & they'll be set fo' life
Lookin' nice sex right livin' in my paradise
I been makin' millions since I was young
& still clockin' still rockin' hoe hoppin'
Showin' all y'all niggas how it's done
You know So So sell copies like Kinko's
So ya better bend before ya go saying too much shit
'cause all I'm about is makin' dough
& makin' mo' keepin' my glow sho nuff
Unlike yo' stuff I make the shit that
Keep 'em runnin' to the sto'
Swappin' drop tops on the regular
Spittin' game on the cellular
If I meet a hoe and the hoe ain't tryin' to fuck
Then the hell with her I'm tellin' ya
Shit we do ya can't erase
Took a little change of pace me & Mase
For the niggas that hate
We still up in yo' fuckin' face.

[Chorus]

[Lil' Kim]
Uhh Now why the fuck you keep blamin' me?
You the one that try to shoot game to me
Thug ass bitch you claim to be
Y'all hoes never meant a thang to me
Frontin' ass niggas want to roll with us
Go with us spend a little dough with us
Got a crush hush on this slim chick
With the wet lips & the set hips
Too much smoke in the Lex' whip
Can't pick who I want to sex with
Got more weed than a li'l bit
Hydro ain't no bullshit
Then I come through in the 6 drop
Me & Li'l Cease doin' the Wop
Infrared clips filled to the top
Y'all niggas need to stop
See-Can I say it again say it again?
Better come through with a little more win
B.I.G. is a slogan R.I.P. 'til I see ya again
Ain't no tellin' in this life of sin
How much dough you got to spend
Take so long you got to bend
Grab yo' man snatch yo' bitch
Fill them flames with them clips
When the cops come stash the Indo
Better throw the weed up out the window
Wannabe clowns got jokes ain't shit funny
Play y'all niggas like dummies click-click
Show me the Money!!

I went from Helly Hanson to mini-mansions 
The girls in Aruba doing belly-dancings 
Spent half of my advancing 
Jaws from branson 
I make it through my circumstances 
But u know I'm wiser now 
Move like kaiser now 
gotta butter soft cover just to hide my pound 
gotta house in the valley 
Come and find me now 
Got enough dough to buy the town 
So I might give a 6 to my chick 
Benz to my mom 
Crib so big it look like the Sinigon 
Give a couch just to spill henny on
And Benadon since Lados and Benaton 

Some people say that I'm not the same girl 
They say that I think I'm in my own world 
What makes them think that I have changed 
A little dough cannot erase my problems 
Me like you I have to try and solve them 
Yes everything is quite the same 

[Chorus]
I'm just trying to be me 
Doing what I got to do 
Some people think that I'm 
Just sittin on top of the world 
I'm just try to be me proving what I got to prove 
Some people think that I'm 
Just sittin' on top of the world 

I wonder why it's often said 
That my life's a fairy tale and 
Everything is so right 
I wish that you could know the truth 
My life is real so please don't get it twisted 
Problems the same and got to be dealt with 
These are the things I wish you knew 

Always in someone's eye so many questions why 
How is it to be down with me with me 
Afraid to express myself always me and someone else 
I need to be free but its not that easy 

[Chorus]

Don't understand why people 
Think I don't have friends 
Who knew me bad when 
This was my dream nothing has changed 
I still do the same things 

Yo,you can quit cookin' short if it ain't about cake 
I ain't sittin' on top I want a house on a lake 
I'm that snotty nosed cat with a new BM 
If you mess with Brandy I gotta bruise your chin 
I be with Puff the girls be like ""Who's his friend?"" 
If I hit a chick once you probably move me in 
So you gotta tell me right now 
Either your wit 
The cats that make the hits or the ones that see the chips 
(Slow down Mase your killin' me) 
But don't stop it 
Whats the use of buying a weight if I'm a hav to chop it 
I use the let a lady till I learned the logics 
She only mess with Mase know the money ain't an object 
If it ain't crissy he won't pop it 
If it ain't platinum with ice he won't rock it 
If it don't cost 60 he don't drop it 
If it don't come with TVs he won't cop it

You're strong enough I know
To bring your dreams to life

I mean what the fuck is it why you stressin' me child
It'd be one thing if you were finessin' my style
But when I go to court, you know the dress of the trial

You not my wife, so if I ask head I be fowl
You better be down, the only question better be, how

That when I hit 'em with some Puerto Rican judo

That's when I say, ""They don't know who gat this is""

And you don't know yo' guns is hand me downs
And you don't know we'll put you where you can't be found

And you don't know baby, we don't need you
And when it comes to Jimmy, my name's, 'Me too'

And when he got ass I said, ""Me too""

And when he got the drop I was like 'Me too'

Aye yo, I pull to the hotel with my shit on blast
Tell the vally, ""Motherfucker don't hit my Jag""

Just show me my room nigga, and get my bags

So the girl, that's my hon, almost dropped his glass
I guess he was shocked when I touched her ass
It really wasn't nothin' she was peedy aight
""Does that say Harlem World?"" Yeah you readin' it right

And we havin' a party, later tonight
Like Phil Collins said in, ""The Heat Of The Night""
'Cause Cam rocks the party all night long
'Til when? 'Til the early morn'

It don't stop and uh it don't quit
And uh drop six and uh we pop Cris
Right now too tipsy to drive

Yo  when you look in my eyes what chu see? 

A sincere man or just a bunch of G 

Why second guess  the brotha would last 

They took a whole clique from the George and the Ave' 

The booties in Arbua  boats and hoover crafts 

So if Biggie could love the dough, Murda could love the cash 

Butter Benz, gave the Tahoe to my other half 

If she got the Benz then guess what mami have 

Why dread it, tell the waiter too much ice in the crib 

Blick's so drunk, he think we singing ""Nights Like This"" 

He say when he grow up he want a life like this 

Sleep all day and plus you want ice like this? 

While girls throwin' head I ain't even touch dice 

I ain't trust Don King, how i'ma trust Mike? 

I date bull daggers, and I don't trust Dykes 

Need a clearner nina, 'cause they don't bust right 

I ain't stingy, when everybody see the plush life 

Buy rims before the benz, so I look just right 

Girls love me, try to get the girls that love Mike 

All I need is a cup of cool-Aid, I got enough ice

All I ever wanted was you for me 

'cause that nigga who I'm with don't give a fuck about me 

And all I ever wanted was to be there for you 

'cause that girl who you with don't give a fuck about you 



You unhappy, and I see it when you cry 

You look like your life has just been minimized 

I ain't your man, I'm your man on the side 

You just call me when you plan to slide 

And if you ever feel like you want to creep 

All you gotta do is just give me a beep 

Only way I won't call you back less I'm asleep 

Gettin' my money or layin' it wit' a piece 

We hit the block, shop a lot 

She see her man, but she don't want to drop the top 

And you know that don't really mean a thing to me 

Can't no girl ever run game with me 

You know Mase, got a lot of places to be 

Spots in Ohio, kick in NC 

And I be wit older dudes and know the rules 

So if a man pick up the phone I know the code to use 



Repeat 1 



If you cheat on me, I'ma cheat on you 

If you don't speak of me, I won't speack of you 

I'll tell you now, we wait about a week or two 

Then I know what we could do 

We could just get our food and stay in 

'cause people on the block is hatin' 

They know your man, and know we datin' 

So we gotta do this just stay friends

Girl named Samantha I met in Clark, Atlanta

Switched up giving me head in Georgia Tech

If I tell you my past, it'll freak you out
Save your dough, you know I wanna treat you out
Fuck sucking your dick, I wanna eat you out
I'm like whoa now, slow down
You remind of these young chickens I knew from uptown
Got a butt like this girl that worked in Motown
So if we ain't gonna fuck then where we go now
I don't move too fast, you move too slow 
You wasn't saying this just a moment ago
You was sitting at the bar just spending my dough 
You owe me something bitch, you gon' blow me or something
She said this thing you need to know before we fuck
I ain't like all these other sluts
And if I told you I was a virgin you wouldn't believe me
I know getting pussy for you is easy
You hit every bitch from Antee to a Tuskeegee
Plus you know I know your girlfriend KiKi
And for a moment honey tried to freak me
But being the man I am I'm still in pimp mode
Could tell she was Harlem 'cause I seen her zip code
And then she started showing me pictures of Flipmode
So I'm with my man and you know we gon' discuss her 
All I could hear is him sayin', don't trust her
You know her lil' cousin fuck with Usher
Plus her best friend got a baby from Busta
So I layed back and peeped the ho'
It's her word against his, I can't believe the ho'

See a man from Spain, holding up my name
Give him my things and head down to bag' claim
And I hear somebody scream my name

So I look back, look once, look twice
Look fast, look left, look right
Look Blink, look Meeno, look Myse
They try tell me honey don't look right

But a girl walked by, caught my eye
So I said, 'What the fuck, stand here and give me luck'
And she whispered in my ear
A purple one on there and put a pink one on there
I did just that and gave Hud a stack, shout 'I'll be right back'
In fact, I'ma be over here talkin' to love
Said you Been Around the World, been so many places
Hit so many girls, and spent so many faces

But the show ain't over until the bottles is empty
Then girls run out the club, follow the Bently
Knowing that every president need a Lewinsky
Girls know I ain't know you but they try to convince me
And any chick that I'm with already know
You ain't gotta like Ma$e, but bet he blow
And anything that I do get heavy dough

How 'my complain  na? 
When I'm as pretty as my father? 
And he got 60 hoes (60 hoes?) 
That know each other (yeah) 

Yo  I'm the problem nigga's got  but scared to step to it 
If a nigga really want it with me? Let's do it 
See cats in the club  it's just music 
Thieves and killers'll tell ya  I just proved it 
I set the tone  ya nigga's adjust to it 
Spit bars  nigga's do sets and rep's to it 
I'm the type that get 30 years and rep through it 
Want it wit' us? Come put your best to it 
Come clean now, I'll send these tests to it 
I should get a Nike contract the way I ""Just Do It"" 
You know I hide B's on it 
Come on B.S. and leave on it 
Get 50 grand and breathe on it 
Red dot, squeeze on it, drop keys on it 
Might hit a chicken and then put Cease on it 
Cats get greed in war with the heat of they jaw 
Somebody move wrong, I put they teeth on the floor 
If they don't show you where the coke at, beat 'em some more 
Make 'em see how it feel to have to eat through a straw 
While I'm sittin' in the car, chick goin' to get my jar 
So I greet them like the chicken they are 
Said Shorty, if you ever follow me and spit a clip in my car 
Tell ya now, that's like lynchin' the law 
Ain't no gettin' up if I hit you 
So all them cowards want to ride with you 
They either die with you, or lie cripple 
Mess with me, now why would you? 
Nigga's die dealin' with dough that's quadruple 
Double Up 

[Chorus: Mase & Flex] 
Where all my down super star's at? (Gettin' it) 
Where the cats at the barn at? (Gettin' it) 
Where the 90 girls that? (Gettin' it) 
Where the girls around the world at? (Gettin' it) 

Real hair, real furs (Gettin' it)

Yo, it's like some be real, sold me three and squeal 
Some hold they head, some see appeal 
Some come home wild in the week to kill 
Then show old cats young cats be real 
Deep throat be how I greet my chick 
Any hoe suck a dick, got at least a six 
Any man call me fam', got at least a brick 
Shut the whole morgue down just for Easter kicks 
When I'm down and out and I need the chips 
Vietnam will be how I leave your script 
And it take dough just to reach the rich 
So can't no senator impeach my 
And don't rush to be somethin' that you're not 
Reworn up lies, keep guns cocked 
And any cat mess with us get one shot 
To do what he gotta do and get somethin' hot 
Blaque, back up, what what 
Blaque, back up, All Out

Yo, please don't make Murda live out the name 
I'm only here to get enough, then I'm out the game 
A nigga didn't want drama, why he came? 
It's like tryin' to win, know you cross the grain 
Messin' with my niggas, ya'll will both get the same 
Cut 'cross the face, now you both look the same 
Still wanted for the bricks, took up in Maine 
Run up for ya chain, fifth cop aim 
Please don't be stupid, come out the chain 
Don't be a hero, this clip will bang 
A nigga like Mase probably got everything 
X-30 G's, then why buy a plane? 
No skinny Benz's, wide-bodied things 
Four dot, six dot, chick dot Range

And a stretch range so at least 20 could ride
And I could tell fake platinum from a mile away
When I rap, yo' 150 thou' get paid

You think I wanna see you cryin'?
You think I want you when you need not one more doll
Then gettin' scared everytime you hear them sirens
Hear niggaz open fire and
Think your baby dead, front of a hydrant
But it's gon' to be a time when 
Ain't gon' be no more wineing
No more dining, no more diamonds
No reclining, no more expensive violins 
And I'mma probably be the one that's cryin'
According to my mother, if you wanna know if a girl love you
All you gotta do is make her suffer
Stop spending, stop givin' her the minks and linen
You will see if this girl gon' be with you to the ending
Cuz floatin' in the drop, it be all good
And when you come in on the block, it be all good 
Givin' her money to shop, it be all good
But when you get broke dead pop, is it all good, huh?

See you be whipping my Benz
But you still wanna listen to your friends
And them gon' be the same bitches with me in the end
You look at your neck, what you see plenty of ice?
Then you think these hoes don't envy your life?
They wanna lay in Brazil, spend a day in the hills
It ain't hard to shop all day and pay the bills
Fuck the way you feel 
And keep it all real I wrote your name on my will 
And yo', that's real

Now good thing I ain't a nigga who get way open
And fall for a chick that live way in Oakland
You pay for a trip, she lay up on an ocean
Then you find out this girl playin' with your emotions
I had this one chick turned out a dumb chick
Cause all she ever did for me was some dumb shit
But I could peep how mommy used to be foul
And everytime I hang up the phone she would redial
But it takes more for Mase to flip
I'm the first one to want out this relationship
Save that Jeep receipt, just in case you shit
You wanna fuck with my friends, take your pick, uh
You wanna do your thing, do your thing then
But don't be feignin' when you see me minglin'
Running up saying you love me and don't know the meanin'
When I walk away I could hear the girl screamin'

Uh  yeah  yeah 

Shit is crazy  yo 

(I feel you though  nigga) 

Who woulda ever thought  same nigga's 

It'd be them same nigga's 

(You are the same nigga  though) 

Same nigga that couldn't get the deal 

Now I'm the hottest nigga wit a deal 

(You ain't changed a bit) 



Yo  niggas never got nothin' good to say  quick to blame 

'Fore you judge me feel my pain 

You know it ain't a vest in the world that could shield my reign 

You ain't got money for the gas bitch, get out the range 

Got welcomed to the game wit' like 4 mil' and change 

Nigga's feelin' like I changed, but I'm feelin the same 

So who cares if they beg to differ 

When all them nigga's that beg to differ 

Is cokeheads and sniffers 

Take me for example, least I made it 

You think nigga's in the hood should appreciate it 

By time it's happy birthday its gon' be belated 

When you me, everything you do get exaggerated 

You miss a nigga pound they gon' say you flipped out 

Take a piss in the street they say you pulled your dick out 

As a youth it's just a lot of shit I want to live out 

Got a lot of friends but only had a few when I was without 

Same niggas I was starvin', couldn't get a crumb from 

Sometimes I think, where all these mother fuckers come from 

I needed money for school, couldn't get no ones from 

Got jumped in the park and couldn't get the guns from 

Instead of rollin' wit a clique, roll wit my sis 

Hell no, these motherfuckers can't hold my stick 

You think I care if they get mad? I don't owe them shit 

want to hold sumthin' hold my dick, nigga 



1 - We might be from a different hood 

But we the same nigga's 

(That's just the way it is) 

Don't be thinkin' shit all good 

It be them same nigga's 

Same nigga's get caught, blame niggas 

Same nigga's, go to court and name, nigga's 

(Some things will never change) 



It be them same nigga's 

Man, regardless how you feel 

(It's the way it is) 

It be the same motherfuckers that'll get you killed 

Them same nigga's, them same nigga's, them same nigga's 

Them same nigga's 

That's why I don't fuck wit niggas 



I got a brotha named Ant, right? Glad to be home 

Been through a lot of shit so I'm glad to be grown 

But yo', where were these freaks when I had no jeeps 

Livin on 34th street and we ain't have no heat 

'Cross from P.S. 92, 7th and 8th 

Asked you for dough and you said ""no"" dead in my face 

But now that I'm on, it's like I owe everybody somethin' 

All my niggas dead so everybody frontin' 

Same kid's went to Catholic school is dealers 

And same nigga's had no heart is now killers 

Sometimes I reminisce on what I said in the mist 

But even when I dream, it wasn't better than this 

But actually, the nigga's who would scrap for me 

Or go as far as getting guns and clap for me 

Ain't even here to get a platinum plaque for me 

I talk to them but they don't talk back to me 

I ain't know you that long so ain't much I can ask of you 

And when I reminisce I can't take it back wit' you 

I can't ask ""Yo' what happen to my nigga Black or Q?"" 

So I don't really need to rap wit you, ya know? 



Repeat 1 



Yo', I figured if we All Out, it's all right 

As long as when we all brawl we all fight 

I'm under nigga's hoses like roses 

Here I am, M A dolla-sign E nigga, fear no man 

Nigga hit me in the mouth and we bound to fight 

Just call my bluff and it be on tonight 

I got words of a madman tatooed on my arm 

Ain't fuckin wit my sister 'cause I'm mad at my mom 

Blink sayin', ""That ain't you wit a gat in your palm"" 

But Blink, it's either that or be harmed 

So the doctor give me pills for the wound, stitch my flesh 

Give a nigga last wish so he could pick his death 

So my sister want to rap and I wish her the best 

But I would never want to wish her my stress 

Cause it's like when I hurt, y'all laugh 

They put me on every forecast sayin' that I bought ass 

So I drink a tall glass before I spaz 

Then I take it like a man and let it all pass 

I wanted big bucks, no whammys, understand me 

I show nigga's love and nigga's underhand me 

Then they wonder why I want no family 

What I need a hooker for, gettin' head from 

And I fear when New Year's come, 'cause it might be the year 

A good nigga die 'cause when you good life ain't fair 

Like you call on the saints but the saints don't hear 

You could cry to the Lord, its like Christ don't hear 

So instead of hood winking I give you the plain facts 

If I never change, how I'm gon' change back, explain that 

They sayin' Mase ain't the same cat 

But every time you get robbed I get ya chain back 

Them same nigga's 

Them same nigga's 

Them same nigga's 

Them same nigga's 

That's why I don't fuck wit niggas 



It's crazy like that, you know what I'm saying? 

You'll be tellin' a nigga you got a deal 

He think that that shit come with Rollies 

And they come wit' Benz's 

Come with Bentleys and houses and shit 

They don't need no one to work, a nigga quitin'

When I can't forget that we all still street

Yo, yo
You know a nigga that's sniffin', that's always in the kitchen
Bagin' shit up, there's always something missin'
A nigga that's speeding, bound to have a collision
Bound to be in prison, or bound to pop a mission
So if you got dogs, nigga, let 'em go
If a mob fuckin' truck right, let 'em know
We got the same guns that you got, but better though
And next time we in some shit nigga, you will know
See I'm pushed to the point that I put something down
And I stand over your head, like look at you now
And the kids in the parks start lookin' around
Like, ""Mommy come here, look, look, look what we found""
Wit' me it's more intense, nigga
So if you ain't goin' hard, stay on the bench, nigga
And you know when I come, I leave no prints nigga
And when you die, it won't be at my expense nigga

I ain't no punk, I ain't no chump, I ain't no whimp
Ain't got no cane, ain't got no ming, ain't got no limp

See I'm unlike the ones who fail you, when I know where you 
Live, I'mma send my kid to take care of you
I'll bring it to my man if he try to spare you 
I'd tie something up if I wanted to scare you
Make it where your own shadow won't stand near you

See I never kill a man, and I do it vainly
I won't ever let a mutha fucka know I'm angry
'cause when I get caught and they come arraign me
It be a surprise witness that come to hang me
I figure, if I'mma do it, I'mma do it my way
Set 'em on Sunday, have 'em by Friday
Then Sunday, I'mma meet 'em on the highway
See where his exit is and keep it movin'
Monday I'm off the exit
All I want to find out is where the complex is
And by Tuesday I'm sittin' in the complexes
All I want to find out is where the address is
And by Wednesday, it just so happen you get shot in the knee
A nigga tried to run away and dropped the key
Now you in the hospital, not critical
Frontin', makin' a scene, bring the whole block wit' you
Friday hit and you ain't got no clique wit' you
Need somebody help you with your leg, got your bitch wit' chu
Soon as you get home and put the key in the door

When night falls - that's when it all begins
Be prepared; we can allow no loose ends
I highly recommend y'all bring your arms
This is no false alarm
They want to do us harm like I'm nervous
Live inside a glass house
They want to bring us down
Then drag us out
It's all about niggas that doubt our reputation
Start'n conflict and don't know what they facing
Want twist us all in their black magic
Suggest paper of wars and break havoc
Are you ready?  Don't sleep on them
Ain't petty, you get that ass thrown like confetti
Meet me at the getaway spot in a jiffy
Leave all the does behind that act iffy
We got maneuvers that's hard to beat
Till the other side retreats
Under six feet beneath

I told you that is a saw I wore
I'm a kill 
When the rebel yells song that don't stop till it's done
See, I got guns, and I'm sick
See how you said meet me here, and I came quick?
Them same cats on the most wanted list
We can hit them, then straight disappear in the mist
...Won't cease to exist
I shoot to kill, and I'll be damned if I miss
A warrior waiting for Armageddon
I get serious as hell when I'm threatened
Intent to get hostile; break into a rage of fury
Send them back their apostle's fossils and crazed right
A rude awakening, and, but now I'm alert
And that's right down my line of work
The whole Brotherhood new verse
Gutless cowards with no back
And watch how they all fall flat 
Ah

La familia actin' like one of us goin' to kill ya
I want y'all dues
Shit hit the fan
We going to be eatin' your food
Time up in the new, then torture
I rip a niggas toe nails off
What, I didn't hear the news? 
Five slayin' the law
Man, how I don't want do these cats
I lay mousetraps for those mice-house niggas that house gats
They want to out me
I know killers from down south, B
Who know and understand there ain't a thing sweet about me
I earn my respect, and I was born to wreck
Spit techs by your rockets threw jets
Who's next to get hit by firepower that's so raw?
Go play; 4-4's ready for war

Don't be fooled; still squeeze tools
Money like that; why the fuck I need school?

No one where my bitch live
Plot where I lay up

Who would understand though?

And flannel; this man knew any clan
We're here for the cats in the minivan
Got let this schemey plan

Get it right, or get it tonight
Better tonight

Man, they love you when you up
Kick you when you down
Look around, VH1 man, where are they down
Life is amusing, nobody like to see you cruising
But everybody like to see you losing
So I stop despise, on top of lies
And if it prophesized I'll be ostracized
One day, I lost my rodium on the day I hit the podium
Now I'm back on top and salty like sodium
A gift to this world man, wrap me with a ribbon
Why do you look for a dead among the living
Some thought I was crazy, some thought I was dissing
Some said I was lazy, some said I was different
I was so loaded, that everybody floated
But once I got the notice then I got focused
And then I saw they motive, so everybody rode it
So I did the way wrote it and live it the way I quote it (come On)

When it seems that the world keeps scratchin' on me
When I'm down at the back, just keep it real

Gotta Survive in this life that's being given to me
So I try and I try to be all I can be
When it seems that the world keeps scratchin' on me
Gotta survive, gotta survive

Hold up, trying to tell me what I'm not
Pull up in the 'Bach, not I'm all of the sudden hot
Now they want to stop just to look at what I got
Thought they want my home man, left me out to rot
So I had to make it on my own, take it on my own
I wanted out the hood I had to 'scape it on my own
Believe me now, it's easy now
'Cause everybody see me now and I'm on TV now
But it started out with low budget
Then I took it around the world the folks love it
In the beginning man, my life it was so rugged
But now I shine like a gold nugget, cause I made the most of it
I know how you feeling man, I was weary
Some days I used to sit there, my eyes all teary
Thinking to myself, do anybody hear me
Now I know, you making it out is not a theory (come on)

Gotta survive, gotta survive

So I try and I try to be all I can be
When it seems that the world keeps scratchin' on me
Gotta survive, gotta survive

I've been laughed at, talked about, ridiculed
But I got a Bentley and I'm still not a bitter dude
And you know it's not coincidence, that me and you is not so intimate
I can't fake, I don't shake, I don't break
I don't lose, I don't use, I don't groove
I never lacked and I'm never going back
I'm nothing you ever sawd of
I'm telling you that I'm immortal

Got to, got to survive
Keep your head to the sky
Got to, got to survive
We can make it if we try
Got to, got to survive
Gotta survive, gotta survive

You know there is nothing in this world that could separate me
From what I believe, from what I've achieved
All of this is because of him
And I'm telling you now, as much as you all don't want to hear this
I could do nothing to myself

Coupes be coming, looking like a relay,
Don't catch it now, get it on the replay,
I'm in my game with some kid named Enrique,
Don't pump weight, don't see the D.A., 
What you hear now, is definitely not a cliche,
Ball so much, I be sold on E-Bay,
People thinking how close the lova,
They hear what's great, and I know some otha,
Some 12 years old, they had a poster of him,
Kids cry you gon get em close to hug em,
And this right here is my retro flow,
The prince of the air got to let you all go,
5 guys arrive when I step to the floor,
Flannels out, push your button and open the door

Put you hands in the air...

The people watch you when you knock the laws,
Even when I'm eating at the lobster bar,
I come out, cops want to stop my car,
I move quick, I can't lolly-gag,
Jewels thick, it make my body drag,
I'm not just a star from the hood,
With money like this, it gotta be good,
Friends platonic, cars exotic,
You name it, you know I got it,
Flows so melodic, sort of hypnotic,
You ain't got to question, dude the kid got it,
Give me another topic, get low, rich low,
You can see this here from the 25th row,
VA to San Francisco, they married to this flow,
Keep the disco, popping like this go

Oh my god, why I got the flow so hot,
I'm thinking now, of hot-hot foreva,
Crusing down on drop-drop whateva,
Cruising down the street on the drop-top carrera,
These cats here can't stop my chedda,
In my formal life there more chris than aguilera,
I roll through, people want to grab my sweta,
So I promised them I won't fly jets in bad weatha

[Chorus]
If you rolling, and you know it,
And you ain't afraid to show it,
Put you hands in the air...
And say oh yeah....
And if you lonely, and you know it,
And you ain't afraid to show it,
Put your drink up in the air... (put em up)
And say oh yeah.... (put em up)

[Bridge]
I'm into what you say, I'm in, I'm in, I'm into what you say (let's work)
Tell me what you say, I'm into what you say, I'm in, I'm in, I'm into what you say (let's work)

If you rolling, and you know it,
And you ain't afraid to show it,
Put you hands in the air...
And say oh yeah....
And if you lonely, and you know it,
And you ain't afraid to show it,
Put your drink up in the air... (put em up)
And say oh yeah.... (put em up)

I tell those, girls in Melrose
That love Chanel clothes
To keep they legs closed
The way we met, gave you major respect
I move bodies like I wave the tech
I make all the young girls stomp like a majorette
You need lights to engage in sex
And just because you got the best ride
Dont mean you the best guy
Like the car, you cant let everybody test drive
And I know you like expensive trips
Expensive whips, and spendin chips
The drink you drink is an expensive sip
I just bought a home in an expensive zip
And ever since I met you it havent been dark since
Hold your hands by a central park bench
Twenty million just for the apartment
No financin tell me when your heart went

And if ya tell him no then he'll understand

And I hold you, higher than I hold myself
And what I told you, it was just to make you wealth
I try to mold you, but you keep goin for self
Uh, I had you on such a high pedastal
Did things for you, I said I'd never do
Gave you my hancock, it wasn't legible
And, the love we had, it was incredible
But, you know I had to move on I guess
Somethin was goin on, people was in my lawn
Talkin on the phone tellin me I did you wrong
And that was just not the norm
I see now everything you said, did you really mean?
Cause everything I said I still mean now
You can make a frown and all the cryin sounds
But this is how its goin down, I'm tellin you now

When you need it, I'm gon' be there (What?)
The love you need is already here (why you keep foolin with him then?)

Good girl wit a thug and its makin me bug
They the ones who want to lose they life
And be wit somebody that'll do them right
Put yellow in they ear, put pink in they wrist
No worldly man would ever think of this
When I'm gone you'll make a wish
You'll dream all the days you could think of this
I only wanted to make sure that you had everything I got
Make sure that you had everything that's hot
Since I got it all you could even have
Mansion wit a lab put somethin in your bag
don't let me, be the one to hold you up

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Get money, make money
Why's it always got to be about some money
Ha, ha, ha, ha
Cause I was born to have it
You satisfied

[Chorus: x2]
In my life, money comes and goes
Money comes and goes
Even when it's movin' slow
I ain't afraid to spend it cause it comes and goes

[Verse 1: Mase]
See the charm is global, the ice on my arm is oval
Money stacked in the back like it's Barnes and Noble
I know a girl Colorado, half of mulatto
Said I was hollow till I bought her a Murado
Some call me Ma$e and some call me Doller
Some came to hate and some came to holler
Followed by a mode,l I ain't even cop a bottle
See me GP and I ain't even hit the throttle
Mansion not listed, why'all got me twisted
Only young boys shop at the district
I hop out of big things rocky wristed
Now everybody thinking I'm domestic
Uh, grown mine, I need to chrome mine
Why yall go lease, I need to own mine
I stay so fresh I need my own line
So if money involved I need a hundred for mine

[Chorus]

[Verse 2: Mase]
I know the pros and the cons to the smoking dons
See I'm laid in the shade to the Boca rotund
And people want to beat me with they open arms
But could it be my Rolls or my frozen arm
I'm like whoa man, mind I remember, I fear no man
Put chicks on the floor like a slow jam
With God on my side I fear no man, I'm deprogrammed
It's like I don't really care what another man think
Love to spend many so I understand
Money in the bank so I understand
Excuse me miss your standin' on my mink
My rock so big it jams up the sink
You can't call me sissy cause my whole hand pink
Enough ice in this to make a man blink
You think I care about what he think
Here we go

[Chorus]

[Verse 3: Mase]
Now you be the middle man, I'ma be the money man
This flow right here, I know you don't understand
Power to get wealth, part of the covenant
I'm not your man, don't front me about your government
Why'all do it why yall way, I'ma do it God's way
Forget the house I put a million on the driveway
Clothes every spendin' winnin' dressed up in funny linen
Grinnin' while I spendin' givin' to men and women
Oh we back we cool we friends again
And we gonna get some lunch
Oh we back we cool we friends again
And you ain't seen me in sixty months
I know how you stunt, I'm hard to distort
You know my face so it's hard to resort
Garage, lookin' like a rob report
House, one hole away from a golf resort

Com on Yea you heard it man

Contract intact can't be underpaid
This ain't a game I ain't come to play
Don't front for me I ain't from the A

Don't you want to hear what I come to say
This just the kid you know me from before
Prices go up when I come in the store
I'm in another island in the bungalow

The bee suit down to my underclothes
Ate like a cat that was undersold
I give, get it back in a hundred fo'
I'm feared like man that was from the ro'

And y'all now that I will bring you out
And when I'm talkin you don't know a thing about
Bring Modenas out take a scenic route
Bettin' against me is bound to clean you out

This is for all of my people
Who stood beside me and still believed
Drop top cars and suvs
G5 flights and shoppin' sprees
This is where you want to be
This is la familia

It's hard to get low in the 3-6-0 spider
License plate all the chicks know
Cats walk around buffed up like a beach guys
But they don't put no fear in these eyes

Beside I'm just here to teach lives
Girl walk around and try to give me the slide
The ice on my arm it gave me all away
I rolled up the tent top up and rolled away

I smell like money lit though the state
Go in my closet first to throw away 
I'm never lost I already know the way
If I need it 'fore tonight I get it 'fore today

I'm God made I took 5 years part laid
Home pool arcade and it's all paid
What's save I spent a third on an upgrade
Then bought palm trees 'cause I ain't have enough shade

[Chorus]

And when the record plays
What will the haters say
Oh don't you be afraid 'cause I'm your allaby
So when I'm drivin' by

Don't try to analyze
Because a him I'm a still be fly
And this a lullaby

Come on now
You know my flow I'm in and out
Non-guilty I ain't gotta buy the trout
Couple a critics but I ain't gonna stop now

I got a plane to catch to be in Moscow
I'm on jets they doin' sky mouths
So I see why the people so hostile
There's now drama it's more honor

I'm wanted in the world like I was Osama
This is no exaggeration
Why's these people so mad and Mase and uh

Half the niggaz in the squad got a scar on their face 
It's a cold world and this is ice 
Half a mill for the charm, nigga this is life 
Got the Phantom in front of the buildin, Trinity Ave 
Ten years been legit, they still figure me bad 
As a young'n - was too much to cope with 
Why you think ? mu'fuckers nicknamed me Cook Coke shit Shoulda been called Armed Robbery 
Extortion, or maybe Grand Larceny 
I did it all, I put the pieces to the puzzle 
Just as long, I knew me and my peoples was 'gon bubble 
Came out the gate on some Flow Joe shit 
Fat nigga with the shotty was the logo kid!

With a matchin jacket, 'bout to cop me a mansion 
My niggaz in the club, but you know they not dancin 
We gangsta, and gangstas don't dance with boogies 
So never mind how we got in here with burners and hoodies 
Listen we don't pay admission and the bouncers don't check us 
And we - walk around the metal detectors 
And there really ain't a need for a VIP section 
In the middle of the dance floor reckless, check it 
Said he - liked my necklace, started relaxin 
Now that's what the fuc* I call a chain reaction 
See ""Money Ain't a Thing"" nigga, we still the same niggaz 
Flows just changed now we bout to change the game nigga

Cause half these rappers they Blow like Derek Pharrell 
If you cross the line, damn right I'm 'gon hurt ya

Then we got Ma$e back to represent everything else in between including the
Percentages of the press we don't

The midwest to the dirty dirty
Even further to Miami

It would probably be best right now if I warned Dre to get on the horn and
Tell him about the storm coming all our way
So tell him pack grab a gat right now get on the floor I'll wait
Shake that ass a little more my way
But baby I don't dance not that I can't there's a pistol in my pants

You don't really wanna run wit the one chick who smoke dutchess for lunchess,
The castle hill I ain't luncheon,
Now its on it 4 the terror squad, pun, prospect, sunshine, geddy, crack and Remy Ma,
It's the hottest chick, in this game want it,
Mah 16 so mean, put 20 g's and my chain on it,
Quik to flip,
I ain't the average chick,
Im packin' a mac in the back of the 45 pass 6,
And you know I got enough goons to crush a country,
Any dude disrespectin' Pun he better play the run c,
Bring your mans, and then we hands all him,
Then we pull timbaland trample 'em, then we pull the cats in them,
Lean back 'cause I aint ever worry, see I'm forever glory, smackin' up any chick in my territory

Nope, Joey bring them semi's out
Force you and yours to pour a little Henny out
So much rappers acting in the game
I had to tell them put the mic away and run and get your Emmy's out

My boxers are covered in her lipstick
Her pussy fat but eatin' good, so that's a misprint

Shiny watch, lookin' like the old Diddy on my arm

I bang at 'cha, hope a plane hit 'cha

Ain't have no time for higher learning
Call me a hypocrite, backslider
You name it I done heard it
The way that they speak of me
You think I've already murdered
It's hard to be laid back

I gave my life up, I gave my rights up
I gave my dice up and I gave my dykes up
I gave my vice up and every club that lights up
And this is were the intern with no perm lights up

I guess it's beautiful pain
It gotta be beautiful pain, uh, yeah, yeah

We came to party, we came to party
We came to party, we came to party
Hey look, I've got my hands all on your body

Ain’t no problem, I’m on it oldest man in the club
Also one of the richest, a hundred bottles of bub
It’s just me and the Russians, we get all of the love
They was aware of the image, they wanna see what he does
TMZ in my face, Oprah all on my couch
Now I’m hosting the Grammys, what is this all about?
International baller, I must admit I had doubts
If they wasn’t callin’ me back, they was callin’ me out
Game moved to the South, I just closed my mouth
Intellect like Belichick when he be switching the routes
I’m too old for the games, no time for the lames
Next challenge? Get this generation screaming my name
Who could do what I did? Boy, I must be the shit
Waved 106 & Park to play date with the kids
People texting my wife, tryna ruin my night
So I help ‘em mind they business with some bottles on ice

Destruction in the club

Oh, no… Big Snoop Dogg
Ice so cold you can see it through the fog
To walk in my shoes it’ll be a little jog
And if you step by the pockets, you gon’ be up in the morgue
The peoples is peepin’, peepin’
The bitches is dippin’, dippin’
So this is the mission, listen, I turn this shit up
It’s the party-rocking, nonstopping, four-hopping, rip and rock
Drippin’ in this motherfucker, burn up, now turn up!

We ain’t flirtin’, we talkin’ – we ain’t dancin’, we walkin’
Teenagers is pointin’, couple cougars are hawkin’
I don’t come here that often, but it’s totally awesome
When you livin’ for real, I don’t consider it flossin’
Panty lines are crossin’, I’m proceedin’ with caution
I don’t shit where I eat, gotta manage your portions
LL Cool J, I’m like the old-school orphan
Representing alone, sittin’ on factory chrome
Shades on, in the zone – Kool Aid smile on my face
My security’s strapped, ain’t no beef, just in case
Me and my man Rich Whites, we in Vegas tonight
Claudine on the celly, make sure that money is right
Red carpet and tuxes, always where the bucks is
Paparazzi are snapping, I can’t believe this is happening
Frustrating the haters, they’re so sick of me rapping
I’m enjoying your blog, I’ve got the same type of passion

[Chorus: x2]

[Repeat x4]
Fatman Scoop, Maserati Cool J
They ain’t think I can do it, that’s why I had to debut it
And let the critics review it, that way I spit and it’s Buicks
Since the beginning, I knew it rollin’ an L in the Buick
Had the guts to pursue it, that’s how a legend should do it

Now, it's a dirty job but somebody gotta do it
So I crept up, stepped up, got to it.. (STAND UP!)

And a condor, killer, set trap artist (oh!)
Send forty-pound slugs through your back artist
(Now that's an artist!) I leave 'em left out
With his flesh out, layin stretched out, sketched out
(No doubt!) I still do the same thing
Streey life is still a Fame game

I hang out and break day until the street lights go off
Or the heat pipe go off (BOOM!)

And knock the venom out a motherfuckin snake

And a hum drum ways 
Hey kids, let me tell you how I met your mom
We were dancin' and romancin' at the Senior Prom
It was no infatuation
But a gradual graduation
From a boy to a man
Let me tell you while I can
The soda pop came free 
Hey Sis, one kiss, and I was heaven bound
Now who would have guessed Milton's paradise lost could be found
But in the eyes of the Dean, his daughter
Was doin' what she shouldn'a oughta
But a man's gotta do
What a man's gotta do
The consequence should be
Church bells, three swells
The Dean, his daughter and me 
They were dating in the park
They were smooching in the dark
Of a doorway for two
She whispered ""I love you -
Ooh, you know I never felt this way before
Ooh, you know the elevator in my heart
Has gone awol, awol, awol, awol""
And then I kissed her
And when I kissed her
It's a wonderful world
When you're rolling in kisses 
Now, the paint is peeling

Now, and when the chips are down

There is something that I want to say to you
You've been on my mind now

And I promise that I will do
Everything you want without a doubt

That we've
Had our share of ups and downs but that's in the past

Everything you want without a doubt

We like Bonnie and Clyde from now on
Back to back, through the ups and downs
Right or wrongs, lay down 
Let me kiss you all down your back
Then I'll go further down, swirl my tongue around
I apologize too 
For not recognizing the pain inside of you
I never lie to you, again
Last time had stress on my mind
Had a hard time believing 
That my girl could be genuine
It's different now, we ghetto lovers fo' real
I grab the wheel, you hold the steel
Teach me how to touch you where you like it the most

Ladies and Gentleman

It's the worlds famous, Lil' Kim, Queen Bee
I am who I am, you just can't change me
No matter what you do, you can't take the hood out me
People been around me for years, don't know shit about me
Dedicated, like Muslims makin' selat
People steady try to make me into somethin' I'm not
That's why I had to cut the grass, so I could see the snakes
Copped the house on the hill so I could see the lakes
What you thought? I'm a girl, couldn't make it alone
Time to turn the heat up and get back in the zone
One day my hairs orange, the next day it's green
The trendsetter's back on your TV screen

This is who I am (This is who I am)
This is what I be (This is what I be)

No, no, no (No, no, no)
Oh, no, no, no, no (Oh, no, no, no, no)
No, no, no (No, no, no)

About five feet even, kinda small in the waist
Rap's sex symbol, real pretty in the face
So what I got even bigger titties than the lakes
Still a sophisticated lady with millions in the safe
Switch up flows like I switch up my clothes
More than Wilt Chamberlain switched up his hoes
I'm a profectionist, gotta stay on my toes
Anything goes when you play with the pro's
I got everybody rappin' about jewelry and cars
Lil' Kim give you a platinum sixteen bars
I'm the real thing, ya'll kareokee stars

No, no, no (No, no, no)

I'd rather be dead and rich than broke and livin'
Without rap, I probably woulda been sellin' dope in prison
With some Vera Wang khakis and Nolteychucks
Suckin' the warden's dick in the back of the bus
But God made me what I am today
So I say things ya'll afraid to say
Just 'cause you got a head start that don't make you strongest
He who burns last, burns the longest
Fuck what they say about me
Fact is I'm the legacy of B.I.G.
The Queen of New York, let's get this straight
I'm about to be elected mayor of 718

This is who I am (This is who I am)
This is what I be (This is what I be)

She maybe kind of crazy its cool long as I school her
I'm smooth as Grand Poobah and I can charm a computer,
For us to conversate all it take to make an impression
Like a teacher lecturing when I'm speaking she taking lessons,
But every time we argue and fight I feel like I'm dying,

Still, keep one in the bed still I be reminiscing boo,
Missin you that's dead real cause you nice in the bed
And you nice with the hand skills you awfully fine,

I love the way we dance in the back of the club, 
boy you know you drive me crazy. 
When you hold my thigh real close to yours, 
make me feel like I'm your baby. 
I just met you, but I'll show you what to do to do it right. 
We'll be dancin', just relaxin' 
be in back of the club all night. 

[Verse 1:] 
When I stepped in the club, 
wait to have a little fun. 
Me and 'bout 5 of my girls, all done up. 
Made our way through the crowd, 
the music was so damn loud. 
But when I spotted you out, 
I just froze up. 

[Bridge:] 
You took my hand and said, 
""Baby, come dance with me - 
I know you want to party with me, 
I know you want to rock with me - 
in the back of the club is where I'll be.""

[Verse 2:] 
Boy, you know you look so good, 
feelin' you like I should. 
But it's getting kinda late, 
don't want this to be over. 
Starin' in my face, 
movin' to the beat of the song. 
Wish it could last all night long, 
don't want this to be over.

Though by tomorrow you're gone;
The song is ended, but as the songwriter wrote,
The melody lingers on.
They may take you from me, I'll miss your fond caress.
But though they take you from me, I'll still possess.

The way you wear your hat
The way your sip your tea
The memory of all that
No, no, they can't take that away from me

The way your smile just beams
The way you sing off key
The way you haunt my dreams
No, no, they can't take that away from me

We may never, never meet again
On the bumpy road to love
Still, I'll always, always keep the memory of

The way you hold your knife
The way we danced till three
The way you changed my life
No, no, they can't take that away from me

Well me and shawty live life

Dès aujourd'hui, je reste loin des ennuis
Je sais que c'est difficile vu l'ère que l'on vit
Maintenant je me méfie comme un homme en sursis
Ma résolution, rester loin des ennuis

Heh eh hey, loin des ennuis
Heh eh hey, loin des ennuis
Heh eh hey, loin des ennuis
Heh eh hey

Je reste loin des tchoins, donc je reste loin des ennuis
Moins d'amis, donc moins d'ennemis bavent
Si je te tends la main c'est que je ne suis qu'un homme
Moyennement sain, je suis en plein dans l'apprentissage
Le visage plissé, inappliqué
Tu veux déchirer mon cœur? Utilise un brise-glace
Je deviens bizarre
Je garde une distance par rapport aux gens
Ce même avec mes proches, je sais bien que c'est contradictoire
Je sens bien que mes soucis me hantent et
Que mon avenir peine à se décanter
Je fuis mes problèmes, mais ces derniers me rattrapent
Je suis conscient que je peux compter sur peu de potes en cas de panne
Hélas, les années passent et je demeure le même
Les aléas de la vie m'appellent
Loin des ennuis, pas pour autant proche du bonheur
Je garde les pieds sur terre
Et ce même si je prends de la hauteur

Dès aujourd'hui, je reste loin des ennuis
Je sais que c'est difficile vu l'ère que l'on vit
Maintenant je me méfie comme un homme en sursis
Ma résolution, rester loin des ennuis

Je me dois d'être exemplaire, je me dois d'être appliqué
Car les petits frères comptent sur moi
""Génération du-per'"" ou ""jeunesse négligée""
Surnommée par les médias
J'ai vu des frères lutter, qui pour se débrouiller
Prenaient le deal comme seule échappe
Qui n'a jamais penser quitter son vrai métier
Pour une vie dénuée d'obstacles?
Mon passé m'a permis d'avoir une autre vision
Rester droit, ferme, puis prendre les bonnes décisions
Peu importe que tu te sois trompé de direction
L'essentiel c'est continuer d'aller de l'avant
Donc

Dès aujourd'hui, je reste loin des ennuis
Je sais que c'est difficile vu l'ère que l'on vit
Maintenant je me méfie comme un homme en sursis
Ma résolution, rester loin des ennuis

Loin des ennuis je m'ennuie comme un gosse qui a tout
Je laisse pas ma vie tranquille comme une go casse-couilles
Tu fuis la son-pri' petit, t'es une grosse cave-pou
T'évites les ennuis, tu te pointes au poste et t'avoues
J'ai les idées larges car mes ennuis sont en leggings
Mes paroles s'embellissent et mes actions sont enlaidies
J'ai beaucoup changé, je suis plus le même selon l'équipe
Je démarre plus au quart de tour
Moi je fais le contour de mes ennuis
Tu cherches les ennuis que si t'as pas trouvé la paix
En concert bizarrement, bah moi c'est la foule qui m'apaise
Pour stopper mes pensées, bah moi faudrait me couper la tête
Mais je souhaite de réussir à tous ceux qui voulaient ma perte

Dès aujourd'hui, je reste loin des ennuis
Je sais que c'est difficile vu l'ère que l'on vit
Maintenant je me méfie comme un homme en sursis
Ma résolution, rester loin des ennuis

Maska,"Comme toi je me contiens et j’attends qu'le vin se remplisse
Mes idéaux s’empirent
Mais tant pis c'est la vie, j'ai pas le choix d'avancer
Sur une lame aussi fine, que celle de leur pensées
Tu m'a fait parler d'amour, mais c'était pour m'étouffer
Hein, un jour tout se sait
J'ai de l'amour j'ai de la haine, mais qui en vaut la peine
Un ami qui va te trair, pour un boule qui pue la merde
J'veux revenir dans l'Dîn, là où les gens sont dignes
Mais la courte durée de ma vie, n'est qu'un mensonge qui m'attire
J'ai de la peine pour les Antilles, le soleil nous a menti
Ils nous donnent le cancer en nous disant je vous embellis
Des journalistes sans peur, ils se nourrissent du malheur
Leurs voix ne tremblent plus en parlant de morts tous les quarts d'heure
La terreur paralyse, mais la peur te motive
Notre fierté aura raison, bien qu'elle soit toujours fautive
L'espèce humaine est plus dangereuse pour la terre que son magma
J'suis qu'un pêcheur dans sa lave qui vient, perdre son appât
Est ce-que tu percute ça va pas, je m'étouffe, dans des draps de soie
Mon cœur, perd de sa valeur, le diable, me dis sa va de soi
Je suis peiné quand je vois ma foi, diminuer sous le poids du rap
Qui me fait kiffer sur l'instant mais me tue façon durable
Je fait un art triste je suis un artiste qui écrit des textes avec l’arthrite
Y'aura que lorsqu'on sera partie qu'il y aura quelqu'un devant ma clique
Persuadé que le mal m'habite, refais surface en cas de panique
Y'a pas de kiff quand y'a pas de risque mais qu’est ce qu'on kiffe être à l'abri
On aime ceux qui nous abîment, le bon son au dessous de ma team
La France me paraît pas radine mais en scred dépouille les sous de l'Afrique
Demande des sous pour le tsunami en fait ce sont des sous-nazis
En un tour de magie, l'alcool me soulage vite
Il nettoie les blessures, mais pas celles de mon cœur
C'est dans tous les sens du terme que l'alcool devient trompeur
Ok tu sors de taule c'est plus la mode des bombers
Mais celle des boules bombés qui ont mis leur coeur dans un bunker
Mon existence n'a pas de sens, mon cerveau n'a pas de raison
Je suis perdu comme un fou je pense m'être enfermé dans ma maison
J'apprécie ma souffrance car je sais qu'elle partira pas
Je m'en plaint pas je relativise l'ingratitude salira pas
Ma reconnaissance, des tonnes de vices akhi c'est pas ça que je vise
Ma fragilité me brise
Ton boule est comme le soleil, il m'aveugle j'ai besoin de lui
Me réchauffe trouve mon sommeil, quand je l'regarde, il me nuit
Assoiffé en Somalie c'est dur de pisser de rire
On cherche a jouir de la vie pendant qu'il essaient de vivre
C'est vrai que le respect se tire en même temps que le temps passe
Leurs discours sont vide de sens pourtant leur conneries s'entassent
Si t'as une femme bien, prends soin de cette perle rare
Chercher ailleurs ne mène nulle part
Ça kalash par intérêt ça se bute pour rien pour un terrain
T'obtiens le respect tu crois que t'es frais, t'es prêt à tout pourtant t'es rien
J'ai délaissé l'salât pour embrasser trop de ?
Je peux pas posséder ma life s'il te plaît Barack aide moi
Ne me laisse pas mener ma barque, tu connaît le blanc est barge
Rappelle moi que je suis Souleymane tu sais j'ai pas de mémoire
Son absence me fait du mal mon père est parti trop tôt
Je le rejoins dans sa tombe akhi y a pas de quiproquo
Je suis comme quasimodo à force de porter ma douleur
Mais j'ai le sourire à tout heure
J'en veux au gens quand je vais mal pourtant c'est eux qui me font du bien
J'ai un défaut ancestral, il m'ont dit que je descend du singe
Chaque fois je m'attache à une femme qui me tend ses seins plutôt que ses mains
J'y vois plus clair dans les flammes mais mon âme cramée s'y éteint
Quand l'homme ne veut plus se taire il laisse parler les guns
Pour réparer ce monde est ce qu'on doit casser des gueules
Rester en place dans le rap c'est comme s’euthanasier
On l'aime pas mais on reste là c'est comme cet état raciste
Oui tu m'aimeras d'avantage le jour où je vendrai moins de disques
Matter en l'air fait mal au cou, tu me préfère avec moins de fric
Parfois je me regarde et je me dit, ferme ta bouche qu'est ce que tu parles
La vie s'est hardcore comme une daronne qui fait du hard
Satisfaire l'homme c'est comme, Dieu-donné sans polémique
Ou rassasier un boulimique qu'est ce qu'on ne ferait pas pour le fric
Un texte un peu sensé comme celui que je viens de faire
Certes y a de l'émotion mais qui te dit que je suis sincère?

Patienter serrer les dents, eh eh
J'implose plutôt que m'enterrer vivant, je m'interdis d'en finir

Celle qu'a prit ton cœur a perdu beaucoup plus

J'canalise mes nerfs comme un pieux entre deux putes

Die, sans que j'fume, j'ai marché sans rotule
La Musique m’a appris de près le sens de flûte
Mais j'ai le cœur en paix, jamais je change de pute

J'prends sur moi comme un obèse bourré de graisse
J'vis pas d'amour et d'eau fraîche j'suis entouré de braises
J'suis pas à plaindre poto, y a toujours pire que soit
J'ai toujours plein d'potos, qui m'rendent visite le soir

Patienter serrer les dents, Eh Eh
J'implose plutôt que m'enterrer vivant, je m'interdis d'en finir

A force de chercher l'or, je vais finir par me perdre
Ceux qui parlent sur moi vont finir par se taire
Je suis pas dans la merde je suis dans les affaires
Beaucoup de soucis à gérer me prend pas la tête
Appelle moi Léonidas j'suis prêt pour la guerre
Vodka et son sont dans mes artères
Trop de galères sur le dos triple hernie discale
Le combat c'est vital, tout ne va pas si mal

aussi vieille qu'elle est elle est trop immature

Tous ces putains d'artistes ne savent pas chanter, tu l'as pas en feat tu devras sampler
On va péter l'million sans marchander, ouais c'est c'qu'on disait dans nos assemblées

Une embrouille, une équipe, on va dans leur quartier, on les baise, on s'barre
On cherche les filles, fuit les flics, pour s'amuser en boite on ne plaisante pas
""Sale babtou"", si j'entends ça j'descends dans ta tess, tête à tête on s'bat
J'suis pas fou j'suis respectable, si tu m'as porté j'te laisse pas en bas
IDR, sors d'la street, on sait toi et moi qu'elle est pas fantastique
Le H de guerre enterre cette lettre, j'veux te voir en paix épanoui dans ta vie
À tous mes frères, s'te plaît (teh?) on sait que le shit est un sale antalgique
La street est dure, elle n'a pas d'cœur, stérile et glaciale comme l'Antarctique

C'est l'histoire d'un monstre qui avait un drôle d'appétit
Il avait déjà mangé les habitants de sa ville
Il parcourait la terre pour continuer à se nourrir
Pour satisfaire son ventre, beaucoup trop de gens vont souffrir
Après plusieurs années, il traverse la mer en bateau
Son voyage sera sanguinaire, il a la colère dans la peau
Difficile de négocier, monsieur ne tolère pas grand chose

Les habitants l’accueillent, le nourrissent en souriant
Mais ils ne connaissent pas le monstre, faudrait qu'ils soient plus méfiant
Ils peuvent pas l'apaiser, sa cruauté est en lui
Il commence par dévorer les plus jeunes, les plus gentils
Rien qu'il mange et grandit, la liste des morts s’empile
Le sang ne fait que couler, la terre est rouge et sans vie
Pas de bateau pour s'enfuir, oui les habitants endurent
Il se nourrit de leur souffrance il apprécie leur sang pur

Plus rien à manger, faudrait qu'il rentre dans son antre
Les habitants sont en transe, mais ne possèdent que des lances
La peau du monstre est immense, et sa haine trop intense
Il repart satisfait d'avoir détruit un continent

Insatisfait d'un festin

Quand tu t'mets au-dessus des autres, t'étonne pas qu'on t'tende la corde
Quand t'as les chevilles qui gonflent, bah forcément tu marches plus droit
J'commence à faire des zigzags, ça craint grave amputez-moi
Ceux qu'on aime sont en nous
Quand ils partent, ça rend fou
Aidez-moi, retenez-moi, j'suis faible et j'pars en couille
Leurs valeurs, leur vieil humour, tout ça me pompe les nerfs
Rappelle-leur que le cadavre se dégrade même si la tombe est nette
C'est en t'passant de la pommade en douce qu'on t'pénètre
Tu t'fais niquer comme tout le monde pourquoi t'as honte, c'est bête
En France pas de vice président, le notre en a déjà trop
Les petits restent impolis, parlent mal, draguent ta go
Drive-by, pas d'magot
Y'a que le matelas de la taule
Pour amortir ta chute qui écrase les tiens par ta faute
L'argent te donne du pouvoir
Tout en t'affaiblissant
T'as l'impression de décoller
Tout en atterrissant
Petit ce monde n'est pas prospère si tu souhaites rouler en grosse caisse
Tu veux mettre tout le monde d'accord
T'as pas le choix mon frère, faut se taire
On doit accepter la mort de ceux qu'on aime par amour
La conscience a des contraintes que l'homme endure chaque jour
Ouais il boit car ça l'saoule, il est saoul car il boit
Se dissoude de tous ses frères pour deux trois sous assieds-toi
J'ai pas fini de te tatouer mes idées dans ton veau-cer
Elles sont noires et malsaines
Et donnent naissance à mes cernes
Seuls les cons trouvent les gens cons
Et comprennent pas qu'on est tous pareils
Tous parés paros tarés
Tout s'paye tôt ou tard
Et Marine Le Pen va vite se perdre dans sa vallée de vice de merde
On utilise pas la haine pour créer une vie de rêves
On connait l'prix de tout, mais la valeur de rien
Et le bonheur des autres crée toujours le malheur des uns
Les orgueilleux égoïstes tomberont jamais amoureux
Tu t'aimes trop pour en aimer une autre, allez avoue-le
Une fois mort beaucoup de bâtards parleront mal de toi
Personne n'encaisse mes vérités c'est pour ça qu'j'rappe le soir
Ceux qui parlent derrière mon dos sont bien placés pour que j'leur chie dessus
Ça évitera les prises de tête, les ""J'vous déteste"" et ainsi de suite
Neuvième zone, L'Institut, Shin Sekai, Wati B
On a construit un empire qu'on peut pas abattre à l'épée
Ma cervelle est molle
J'encaisse des coups durs, j'en panique
Qu'ai-je foutu dans ma vie?
L'impression que je cours
Tout nu dans ma ville
J'suis foutu sans ma fille
Le Tout-Puissant m'anime
J'coule dans les abîmes
J'm'étouffe dans les habits

J'me sens seul même quand on chante devant 20 000 personnes
Si j'dis tout ce qui m'a blessé bah j'ai bien peur que vos cœurs se perforent
Un frère dans la coke et c'est moi qui fait des nuits blanches
J’appréhende l'année suivante, la vie est flippante
Ceux qui parlent derrière mon dos sont biens placés pour que je leur chie dessus
Dites aux médias de bien réfléchir avant de vouloir nous tirer dessus
Car on s'est relevé plus fort
Le mal qu'ils nous ont fait est resté dans mon corps
Quant à ceux qui me critiquais car j'étais le seul blanc du groupe
Dieu merci j'suis plus ouvert que vos cœurs fourbes
J'oublierais pas toutes ces bavures, humiliations de keufs ingrats
Plaqué sur l'sol, baggy baissé, ça ma fierté s'en souviendra
On m'a mis le ventre ouvert, ça a serré mon coeur
Tout le liquide que je bois ne fait qu'accélérer mes pleurs

T'as d'la chance j'tappe pas les femmes, t'aurais perdu toutes tes dents
Noie toi dans tes larmes, morte t'as plus de charme

Adama me l'rappelle, ""Fais salat t'as pas l'choix""
Les larmes coulent sur mes frères, transformés en passoire
Un mec bien qu'aimerait s'poser, j'arrive plus à m'asseoir
J'reste debout et basta, nique sa mère j'suis pas stable
T'es qu'une michto d'passage, une autre fille t'remplacera
J'vais pas tout t'donner hun, juste mon corps mais pas d'cash

Regarde c'qu'on a vécu, elle est pas violente cette ville
Décembre, prêche en Italie, remplir des Zéniths
Ils savent pas qu'on est des frères avec ou sans la musique
Je l'ai dans l'sang la musique, comme un virus nuisible
Ouais sérieux c'est easy pour nous d'faire des tubes ici
Des frères me trahissent, qui m'entubent à domicile
Si mes ancêtres sont des singes, akhi j'ai pas d'origine
J'suis l'Yin et l'Yang en même temps, intelligent et méfiant
On dépend tous d'un rectangle, carte bleue, billets d'banques
Ça devient pas inquiétant, ça l'a toujours été

Votre opinion m'a stressé, j'me sens sans cesse agressé

Qu'ils viennent tous me tester, j'vais les t'nir en respect
Plus de rimes que t'espères, plus de haine que d'espèces
J'suis modeste et pépère mais viens pas teste un mec fièr
Une plaine et deux cow-boys peuvent vite devenir un western

J'suis un pirate de l'époque, un navire me suffit pas
Et si l'capitaine me bloque, les conséquences il subira
J'ai d'la sueur sur mes draps, même quand j'dors j'fais des efforts
Ouais l'avenir me sourit pas car au bout il y a la mort
Aucune crainte de perdre la vie mais d'rencontrer des anges hardcores
Tu veux m'complimenter ? Viens pas couronner un mort
Le frelon sort de taule, il a besoin d'se détendre
Alcool et femme, laisse ber-tom, tu sais comment on s'distrait
Oui le Diable est discret, introduit nos systèmes
Nerveux et on s'y fait, Lucifer est si fièr
Shit, coke et misère, toi tu vis du deal d'herbe
À part toucher le SMIC, j'me d'mande à quoi les flics servent
Pardonnez-moi si j'rêve, de les voir en civière
Ceux qui pèsent le plus, sont au fond de la rivière
Allô Abou, appelle des poufs, que l'démon se libère
Ramène nous des sirènes avec des langues de vipère
Pour foncer dans un mur, pas b'soin d'avoir ton mis-per
Location de tombe, ça rémunère les cimetières

Paris by night à la recherche des acheteurs
C'est pas pour trouver l'âme sœur qu'on met nos pieds en after
J'passe en débat différé si j'ai pas d'alibi
Quand j'vais en Belgique, j'me dirige pas vers Walibi
J'ai jamais rien compris aux maths, t'as vu
Donc j'me r'trouve à faire des ronds à tous les angles de rues
Des récits fantastiques, des statistiques statiques
On veut d'venir obèse mais l'État sert d'anneau gastrique
Quand j'voulais qu'on m'tende la patte, y avait pas un chat
On d'vait graille dans la même assiette mais t'en as fait ton plat
Perce, tu vis un cauch' quand tu rêves
Les gens te gonflent en espérant qu'tu crèves si un jour tu perces
Haa, tu sens la rage quand j'parle
Chez nous c'est soit les putes soit les keufs qui palpent
C'est la même combine qu'on deal ou vende des compils
Retourne dans tes comptes, pines pour éviter qu'on t'pille
Ils veulent savoir si j'possède des biens d'grosse valeur
J'me demande avec quelle arme j'vais affronter l'fossoyeur
10 ans plus tard j'suis toujours l'même putain d'gosse râleur
J'tourne en radio sans qu'tu m'entendes, j'suis un ghost rideur
J'étais mineur émancipé par des cas d'force majeur
17 ans en taule, sorti avec une force d'ailleurs
J'ai la dalle, j'suis en chien, j'ai le mort d'ailleurs
C'est c'qui a faillit nous faire braquer ces convoyeurs
On était con voyons, loin d'être visionnaires
On voulait juste baiser la rue en missionnaire
On voulait s'déplumer, pour des prises de bec
Ça jouait les gros bras aux premières prises de pecs
Soit t'étais sur l'terrain soit t'étais mis sur l'tec'
On savait exiler tous les fils de traîtres
Les fils de traîtres ou les fils de lâches
Ont baignés dans leur sang et ont pris le large
M'dépasser pour mes gars, bâtard, j'ai l'art d'le faire
J'prendrai la vie de celui qui veut enterrer mon H de guerre
Rappelle toi de nos cambriolages en l'an 2000
12 ans plus tard en cellule on s'tape des barres de rire
J'connais Paris de fond en comble, ses côtés les plus sombres
Tu dois noircir ton cœur pour briller dans la pénombre
J'ai volé, j'ai racketté, j'ai fait du mal à autrui
La rue m'a instruit, mais la rue m'a détruit
J'ai tabassé des gravons, j'avoue j'ai boxé des javons
J'me suis aussi mangé des K.O., bouche ouverte sur l'carreau
J'ai fait ma salat mais j'ai plus souvent commis des pêchés
La question, est-ce que ton gars Abou va s'faire repêcher?
Haa bref, assez, laisse le passé au passé
Mon gars Maska m'appelle, ce soir y a du gibier à chasser
On s'capte à 9h pétante, j'suis pas d'ceux qu'ils prétendent
J'sors de taule, j'tire un coup juste histoire d'me détendre
Peu importe la filière, j'veux pas toucher une misère
J'finirai en civière ou comme tout l'monde au cimetière

Donc quiconque me doit des thunes va payer sinon l'bitume
Cognera sa tête très fort, j'veux pas qu'on m'prenne pour une petite pute

Ten suits of clothes to dress to kill
A ten room house, some Bar B Q
And fifty chicks not over twenty-two

A street that's paved with natural pearls
A wagon load of bonds and stocks

Ahhhhh, now listen boys throw me
Smack dab in the middle right now
So Ray can rock and roll to satisfy his soul

Oodles of butter and somethin sweet
Gallons of coffee to wash it down
Bicarbonated soda by the pound

ett gäng där man inte kunde dra sig ur
jag var femton med kände mig som tjugosju
och jag skäms för jag minns att vi var som djur
sprang runt i Ronneby med Mattleys barettaatrapp, sa det BLACKA BLACKA
mellan dig och ---, var jag på plats
men spöa dig för du var svart
Inne på Victors tar jag flaskan i baren och bara smack!
flyttade från ronneby redan följande natt
inga pajasar för fick dom tag på mig så var jag fucked
Flyttade tre mil till Karlskrona
Inte så långt men under Anders beskydd så var jag skonad

Gick till den lokala musikaffären och köpte mick
Hade ingenting till att tjäna lika mycket som min månadslön på ett dj-gig

om en cigg ända tills någon hostade blod

att morsan var död, välkommen till buffalo blues
för det handlar om rätt val svenne
kalla det för bäst av, pepp-talk, pepp-talk
morsan sa alltid backa innan det händer nåt
men ibland är det svårt att bete sig som barnen bernadotte
om ni försvinner med mitt gage
kan vi dribbla längre än fram och tillbaks
vi kommer nästan ingen vart som bollen i en pingismatch
så du kör med tesen: bränner jag en artist
står tusen åter, drar jag ut min kuk ur röven
kommer ändå någon ny och suger på den
varför? för branschen är så sjukligt logisk
jag är framgångsrik
nu kör jag bilen själv för och slippa chaufförer som kör med handbroms i
blygsamt, skrytsamt men har rent mjöl i påsen om du skrapar
längre ner än på ytan

jag har haft en massa problem hur förklarar jag skiten
för folk som aldrig lidit eller som fått stryk som liten
för varje år som går så ökar åldern, eskalera våldet
jag var sjutton, bodde själv och hade tappat kontrollen
hamnar i fight och ville visa mig som tuffast i gruppen

Drinking her wine 
We talked until two and then she said 
""It's time for bed""

In the morning and started to laugh

But come ye back when summer's in the meadow,
Or when the valley's hushed and white with snow,
It's I'll be here in sunshine or in shadow,
Oh, Danny boy, oh Danny boy, I love you so!

But when ye come, and all the flowers are dying,
If I am dead, as dead I well may be,
You'll come and find the place where I am lying,
And kneel and say an Ave there for me.

And all my grave will warmer, sweeter be,
For you will bend and tell me that you love me,
And I shall sleep in peace until you come to me!",Danny Boy,2008

I'm staying far away from there
I'm going north of san francisco

And buy an old house that I can work on
Where the next nearest neighbor lives miles away

There was a bird trapped in my heart
I tried to open up and let it out
Before it tore my chest apart

I tossed and turned, I prayed for it to stop
I scratched my face an' tore my sheets
But I was way too late, my heart was gone
And in its place these bird wings beat

And I was waken from a day to day dream
There was a bird trapped in my mind
I tried to open up and let it out
But there was no use in tryin'

And where I once had a head full of thoughts
Of happiness and daily things
There is only strange darkness now
And in the darkness this bird sings

I've been comin' for some time
I'm comin' down the mountain

Where the summer breeze
Blows through the windows in the afternoon
And all the stars come out at night

And there's a bird up in my tree

And opened my window over Bondi beach
Where all the stars seemed out of reach
And recognized none but the southern cross

Sitting on my bed with the light turned off
Till I found a sweet song on the little clock radio and it made me cry
Singing have some faith, have some faith
And I don't know what I want but I know where I want to be

And everywhere I go, I wish you were here with me
Stars hang on tiny strings, my dreams are made of memories
Once everything made sense, now I get so alone that I can't sleep
Will somebody please tell me if this is where I'm supposed to be

Bottles on the table and socks on the floor
Trying to remember what I started this for
When a surfer friend of mine came and picked me up
And we paddled out as the sun was coming up

Talking about how everybody has to find
Something that gives them the strength to be alive
And out laying on our boards in the southern hemisphere, he said to me
Gotta have some faith, have some faith

And I don't know what I want but I know where I want to be

Or from sunny Barcelona
We rose up through the mountains
As the sun started setting

And the sea came out below us
As we rode through a village
We passed ten feet from a little porch
Where a man was serving dinner

And our window was open
And we could hear them laughing

You were born and I saw your face
And you looked up at me

But before I could hold you
The doctors raced you from me
They told me that you might not live
Your heart was not healthy

And with wires coming from you
I sat beside you

If I jump, I'll surely drown you""

You said, ""Life has no limit

Mason Jennings,"Dust cloud coming off an old dirt road
That leads up here to this little graveyard
Seven lights in a perfect row
Under each light is a police car

Just because you say it doesn't make it true
You can say that I'm guilty man I just don't care
You can burn my body black
Just don't make me go back to Jackson Square

I met you on Decatur Street
With your little bare feet and your violin
I was walking by with my guitar in my hand
You smiled at me and I jumped right in

Before I knew it you were all I knew
Every moment together was an answered prayer
After a while we had some money saved up
And we rented a room over Jackson Square

Then one day everything changed
Your eyes got strange, you didn't seem yourself
You'd go to tell a story and you'd start out fine
Halfway through it you'd be somewhere else

And I started having the strangest dream
I held a string and looked up in the air
And you were glowing with the strangest light
Drifting out of sight over Jackson Square

Life is something that you can't control
When you try to hold onto it, it makes you let go
Things are not like they were before
I can hear her crying through the bathroom door

She says, she hears spirits all around the room
And they're telling her things that make her feel scared
I have no idea what to do
Before we're in over our heads in Jackson Square

I woke up with a weight on my chest
People were screaming on the street below
I reached for you, I was alone in the bed
Wind was blowing through an open window

Suddenly I was very old
In a little boat, absolutely nowhere
Staring at the side of the universe
And your tiny body down on Jackson Square

Now don't tell me that there ain't no end
There damn well is and it waits in the wings
I see you kneeling there at center stage
In your tiny cage made of angel wings

While I'm here every night
Loading my gun and trying not to go there
Anyone who says that life is clear
Has never seen a mirror or been to Jackson Square

Did we make you up?
Is salvation what you want
Or is faith enough?

Do you know where I'm bound?
Do you know who I am?

Standing like a statue in the sea
In a little truck stop in Tennessee
And bombs are crashing down in waves
On a giant TV screen

And I am struck

What can I do? People are dying in their beds
While this flag flies over our heads

Jesus, are you stronger than a loaded gun?
I'm beginning to believe you're not the only one
Strong enough to show your love, strong enough to give
Strong enough to go through hell, strong enough to live

And all night long I sat with you
In a darkened hospital room
And nurses checked in by the hour
I was made aware of a higher power

And how this fragile life we live
Is not ours to keep but ours to give
What in the world am I gonna do
If anything should happen to you?

I mean I search for peace
I search for hope, I search for love
And one day for release

Jesus, my life does not feel the same
New things happen everyday, things I can't explain
But I am not a man of faith, I'm a man of truth
But is this feeling in my heart, is this feeling proof?

When you do not know, you know
And when you know, you do not know
And when you think you do, you die
And when you do not think, you grow

Are we left here in the dark
Or are we left here in the light?

With a cane that he twirled around his diamond ring finger
At a Baltimore hotel society gath'rin'

And the cops were brought in and his weapon took from him
As they rode him in custody down to the station
And booked William Zanzinger for first-degree murder

Oh, but you who philosophize
Disgrace and criticize all fears
Take the rag away from your face
Now ain't the time for your tears

William Zanzinger, who at twenty-four years
Owns a tobacco farm, six hundred acres
With rich wealthy parents who provide and protect him
And high office relations in the politics of Maryland

Reacted to his deed with a shrug of his shoulders
And swear words and sneering, and his tongue it was snarling
In a matter of minutes on bail was out walking

Oh, but you who philosophize
Disgrace and criticize all fears
Take the rag away from your face
Now ain't the time for your tears

Hattie Carroll was a maid of the kitchen
She was fifty-one years old and gave birth to ten children
Who carried the dishes and took out the garbage
And never sat once at the head of the table

And didn't even talk to the people at the table
Who just cleaned up all the food from the table
And emptied the ashtrays on a whole other level
Got killed by a blow, lay slain by a cane

That sailed through the air and came down through the room
Doomed and determined to destroy all these gentle
And she never done nothing to William Zanzinger

Oh, but you who philosophize
Disgrace and criticize all fears
Take the rag away from your face
Now ain't the time for your tears

In the courtroom of honor, the judge pounded his gavel
To show that all's equal and that the courts are on the level
And that the strings in the books ain't pulled and persuaded
And that even the nobles get properly handled

Once that the cops have chased after and caught 'em
And that the ladder of law has no top and no bottom
Stared at the person who killed for no reason
Who just happened to be feelin' that way without warnin'

And he spoke through his cloak, most deep and distinguished
And handed out strongly, for penalty and repentance

Mason Jennings,"When I got off the bus it was six in the evening
Snow was blowing across the intersection
For the last six hours I've been lost in a book
So it took me a second to remember what I was doing

Standing in the middle of a bustling sidewalk
Under barren branches silhouetted by street lamps
I reached into my overcoat pocket
And brought out a letter with your address on it

And I may be dreaming but I've come to you
I have nowhere else to run
How you gonna say what's never been said?
I'll tell you how it's done

You just look into your eyes
You look into your eyes
And follow 'em down, you gotta follow 'em down
Till the streets are lined with trees

On the last block there's a little blue house
It's the only house I see
And up in the window a light still shines

Your daddy showed you what was wrong with life
I wanna show you how to make it right

These were supposed to be my carefree single days

Told ya keep it frozen, it caught fire instead
Have you not heard a single word I've said?
No, you were busy loving your new man

He probably drives a truck and his hands are probably big
I bet he fixes things around your place when they break
If he says he likes your cooking he's a fake

Please say, he doesn't wear a gold chain, please

When the thought of you tears at the seams of every dream that I've built since then
It could be anything
Could be standing on a corner in China and somebody will say your name
I thought I was stronger than that
When I was young older people would reminisce I'd say no that's not me
That's not me, its you, it's always been, your ghost just will not rest
Walking the horizon line in my favorite summer dress

Do you remember when I broke your clutch and you threw both your shoes at me
Talking your brother into buying us wine cause we didn't have any ID
What was so rough, was it the freedom that freaked us out
Now nobody's free
and there's so much we could do without
we could live in a dream, live in a dream, live in a dream
Live in a dream

What good is remembering
Got me standing on the present moment like an island in an endless sea
We can only go sailing out
Drawing circles in circles but there's no safe harbor out there for me
I thought I was smarter than that
Thought that I could live two lives at once while other suckers they just lived one
What's the moment in your life that you just would not trade
If you had a time machine would you go back there today

Do you remember when you kissed me so hard that you chipped both of my front teeth
Counting our cigarettes and spacing them out trying to make them last the whole week
What was so rough, was it the freedom that freaked us out
Now nobody's free
And there's so much we could do with out

Mason Jennings,"I was standing by the village gates when I first heard the news
The king had sent his men to seize Gabriel's land
And when Gabriel he refused, the men took both his daughters
And cut the wedding ring fingers from their hands
The next three days I heard three times separate similar stories
The king was taking what was ours for his own
Deep, deep down in the pit of my chest my fear turned to fury
When I thought about my family and my home

Good kind Rudy stood before the king
His mighty sword in his hand
All through the valley we could hear him swing
And a joyful cheer filled the land
Nobody's ever gonna treat us like that again
Late that night all the men in the village
gathered in a clearing in the forest
And we elected Good Rudy to lead us now

He decided right away that the king must die
Every head bent forward as he told us how
We split up into two large groups
and headed for the castle on the hill
My group stormed the front, all the guards came running

Rudy's group snuck up from the back and laid
their ladders up against the castle walls
Nobody ever saw them coming

I first knew something was wrong when I was half my age
One night while I was singing, I started to laugh,
I couldn't stop laughing for a week and a half

I'll never forget the girl in the first row,
She said, ""But its not funny""
I said, ""I know""

So I went to a shrink and he said to me,
""Just don't drink when you're nervous,
That's the key""
And I said, ""Okay, that sounds fine""
I didn't tell him I was nervous all the time

So I kept on drinking,
And I kept on thinking

Wake up, you're dying now
You should be dead,
But you're not somehow
You think you're being brave,
But you're digging a grave
You talk like a master,
But you live like a slave

I started meditating, that worked for a while
I spent a lot of time alone,
And I forgot how to smile
I went to church, I'd just sit there and stew
Thinking, ""How can all these people believe things that aren't true""

It seems to work well for them, why can't I?
I guess it's 'cause I'm special
'Cause I'm too smart a guy

I called a guy I know on a telephone
I told him all I ever wanted was to be perfect
I sure as hell don't wanna be an alcoholic

Acceptance is a doorway to hell,
If you're on the wrong side,
Things don't go so well
So I accepted who I am, and named my disease,
And finally felt relief, and got down on my knees

And the paper they were signing said
They'd never fight again

And when the papers was all signed
And a million copies made
They all joined hands and bowed their heads

And grateful pray'rs were prayed

I saw what I'll relate to you, going on behind my back
It seems the folks were up-in-arms, a man now had to die
For believing things that didn't fit, the laws they'd set aside
The mans name was ""I'm a Freak"". the best that could see
He was the executioner, a hangman just like me
I geuss he'd seen loopholes from working with his rope
He'd hung the wrong man many times, so now he turned to hope
He talked to all the people from his scaffold in the square
He told them of the things he found, but they didn't seem to care
He said the laws were obsolete, a change they should demand
But the people only walked away, he couldn't understand
The marshals name was ""Uncle Sam"", he said he'd right this wrong
He'd make the hangman shut his mouth, if it took him all day long
He finally arrested Freak, and then he sent for me
To hang a fellow hangman, from a fellow hangmans tree
It didn't take them long to try him in their court of law
He was guilty then of ""Thinking"", a crime much worse than all
They sentenced him to die, so his seed of thought can't spread
And infect the little children, that's what the law had said
So the hangin' day came 'round, and he walked up to the noose
I pulled the lever, but before he fell I cut him lose
They called it a conspiracy, and that I had to die
So to close our mouths and kill our minds, they hung us side-by-side

And now we're two hangmen, hangin' from a tree
That don't bother me, at all
Two hangmen, hangin' from a tree 
That don't bother me, at all
(Same all the way to the end)
",Two Hangmen,1974

You've got to think now friend, 
How does that grab your signed-up majority, 
Are you worried about the people giving orders?

Hey friend, you don't have to be silent anymore,
Things do affect you you know, things like pollution, tax and wars, 

How would you like to have your healthy kid die of suffocation
On the streets? 

You'd better talk to people giving orders

Running low on hope, I can't get back
Made a hole in my head, then forgot why i did, you're all gone.
Made a run for a gate, but there's laws in this state, you're all gone.

I tried to warn you, but you were out of your head
I tried to hold you back.
I tried to warn you, but you were out of your head

I'll meet you in the fog again
and between you and i we can
make some sense of this
drank the dirt, ate the sand,
tried to get full on whatever i had on hand

I found a crystal ball, but I lost it.
I bought a tea leaf to find out where you are
but i drank it
only seer i could find
told me lies, told me you were just fine
burned her place to the ground
i'm regretting it now

Proud 'cause there ain't an empty seat in the place

I got a whole new perspective

I wanna be famous for lovin' you

Mason Williams,"When the work begins to pile up,
And your temper starts to rile up,
That's the time a fellow needs a song.

Doctor, Banker, Butcher, Baker,
You can be a merry maker,
If you'll keep on singing all day long.

If you're hanging in suspense from eight till five,
And you want to keep the sense of humor alive.
Just, whistle while you work (whistle)
Put on that grin and start right in, 
To whistle loud and long.

Just hum a merry tune (hum)
Just do your best,
Then take a rest and sing yourself a song.

When there's too much to do,
Don't let it bother you, 
Forget your trouble, try to be just like a cheerful chick-a-dee,
And whistle while you work (whistle)

Come on get smart
Tune up and start
To whistle while you work.

Mass Hysteria,"ACID :
V'là qu'on s'dresse comme des teignes face à l'oppression
La "" Gad "" "" Mass "" et l'hystérie monte comme à "" Richter ""
Faut qu'on déteigne en c'monde, fonde, que le règne riche s'termine
Là où cette oeuvre gronde, j'prône, marque de noblesse, trône,
Là où mes mots blessent et n'cesse de lutter contre les textes dénudés
Mais est-ce vraiment nécessaire ? Vu qu'au final l'arriviste se sert de nos textes
Pour s'engraisser certains en crèvent ! C'est triste mais, j'n'aurais d'trêve, r'garde,
J'rêve plus qu'en "" seize "", saisie le micro comme un glaive malgré le C.S.A. Et
Sa part en couilles... Ça part en couilles !
On s'dresse contre l'oppression
L'union notre mission, ambition
On s'dresse contre l'oppression !
BASE :
J'ai l'devoir d'm'exposer à la tâche, d'être celui qui arrache
Toujours prêt pour le clash, faut qu'je lâche !
Dans ma rue faut qu'j'ai la condition, je rappe avec conviction,
Garçon fait pas l'con, protège ton fion.
J'ai le mordant comme un chien, dénonce, n'épargne personne, Iynche !
Avec des textes plein de hargne, le diable qu'essaie d'me charmer.
Ma vie un vacarme. J'résiste pour la masse.
Faut qu'je le confirme ici avec la "" Mass "",
Ça ne fera pas d'moi celui qui amasse le plus.
Mais face au miroir de la vie, j'veux rester ce mec ravi.
Je grandis avec des textes plein d'utopie et si on n'rêve plus ?
A quoi bon vivre ? ]'ai les Iyrics qui enivrent, à toi d'me suivre.
Je t'apprendrais à être libre (libre !) à voler comme Acid,
A prendre possession de toi-même. Ici pas de concessions,
La Brigade. Notre obsession rester vrai. Pour la nation.
La vérité comme marque de noblesse. Trop d'mensonges blessent
Alors faut qu'on inspire et pour ça je transpire ! ! !
On s'dresse contre l'oppression
L'union notre mission, ambition
On s'dresse contre l'oppression !
MOUSS :
L'expérience de nos vies est explicite
"" Chaque instant partagé est un moment magique ""
et médite ou cherche une logique aux moments uniques.
Je place dans l'absolu, la nécessité d'être une bonne personne,
Bienvenue dans la dimension des gars qui fusionnent, des gars qui raisonnent
Branle bas de combat, aux microphones on s'rend aphone !
Pour que le respect se fixe sur les actions, les paroles et sur chaques neurone.
On n'sort pas de Saint-Cyr mais de derrière les fagots !
De rien on est sûrs, sinon que sur ce morceau

You know I talk like a pimp
With the Ghost like a mac
Takin' off like Kemp, play that post like Shaq
Cold fever from money, Morocco when sunny
Quarter mill on the wheel
Thirty chains on my stomach
Got plenty to smoke, champagne for the pain
Doin' doin' the most, you know we runnin' the game

Whoa, Whoa
Drinks in the air, like everybody feel like
Whoa, Whoa
Everybody hands in the sky like
We run the night like
Whoa, Whoa
Drum beating harder than the Congo
She drop it down low
Whoa, Whoa
Up on the seats sayin' watch me now

I chase up she got me running every light
She see me coming got me swerving left and right
She in a tight spot checking all her blind spots
Cause I know you want me there when the lights out
She got the pedal to the floor in the rain
In and out of rain like its some kind of game
I'm thinking that I gotta speed up
Cause I know that she don't wanna slow down

And I know that she wanna get down with a thug
Smack that give some love when she wanna
Wanna give anything to get on her
I lace her up in some Gucci and Prada
Take her to the crib it's on all night

She needs to be all that, type of girl that

Massimo Bubola,"Darkness at the break of noon
Shadows even the silver spoon
The handmade blade, the child's balloon
Eclipses both the sun and moon
To understand you know too soon
There is no sense in trying

Pointed threats, they bluff with scorn
Suicide remarks are torn
From the fool's gold mouthpiece
The hollow horn plays wasted words
Proves to warn that he not busy being born
Is busy dying

Temptation's page flies out the door
You follow, find yourself at war
Watch waterfalls of pity roar
You feel to moan but unlike before
You discover that you'd just be
One more person crying

So don't fear if you hear
A foreign sound to your ear
It's alright, Ma, I'm only sighing

As some warn victory, some downfall
Private reasons great or small
Can be seen in the eyes of those that call
To make all that should be killed to crawl
While others say don't hate nothing at all
Except hatred

Disillusioned words like bullets bark
As human gods aim for their mark
Made everything from toy guns that spark
To flesh-colored Christs that glow in the dark
It's easy to see without looking too far
That not much is really sacred

While preachers preach of evil fates
Teachers teach that knowledge waits
Can lead to hundred-dollar plates
Goodness hides behind its gates
But even the president of the United States
Sometimes must have to stand naked

An' though the rules of the road have been lodged
It's only people's games that you got to dodge
And it's alright, Ma, I can make it

Advertising signs that con you
Into thinking you're the one
That can do what's never been done
That can win what's never been won
Meantime life outside goes on
All around you

You lose yourself, you reappear
You suddenly find you got nothing to fear
Alone you stand with nobody near
When a trembling distant voice, unclear
Startles your sleeping ears to hear
That somebody thinks they really found you

A question in your nerves is lit
Yet you know there is no answer fit to satisfy
Insure you not to quit
To keep it in your mind and not fergit
That it is not he or she or them or it
That you belong to

Although the masters make the rules
For the wise men and the fools
I got nothing, Ma, to live up to

For them that must obey authority
That they do not respect in any degree
Who despise their jobs, their destinies
Speak jealously of them that are free
Do what they do just to be nothing more than something they invest in

While some on principles baptized
To strict party platform ties
Social clubs in drag disguise
Outsiders they can freely criticize
Tell nothing except who to idolize
And then say God bless him

While one who sings with his tongue on fire
Gargles in the rat race choir
Bent out of shape from society's pliers
Cares not to come up any higher
But rather get you down in the hole that he's in

But I mean no harm nor put fault
On anyone that lives in a vault
But it's alright, Ma, if I can't please him

Old lady judges watch people in pairs
Limited in sex, they dare
To push fake morals, insult and stare
While money doesn't talk, it swears
Obscenity, who really cares
Propaganda, all is phony

While them that defend what they cannot see
With a killer's pride, security
It blows the minds most bitterly
For them that think death's honesty
Won't fall upon them naturally
Life sometimes must get lonely

My eyes collide head-on with stuffed graveyards
False gods, I scuff
At pettiness which plays so rough
Walk upside-down inside handcuffs
Kick my legs to crash it off
Say okay, I have had enough
What else can you show me

And if my thought-dreams could be seen
They'd probably put my head in a guillotine
But it's alright, Ma, it's life, and life only","It's Alright, Ma (I'm Only Bleeding)",2003
Massimo Cavalli,"Skylark
Have you anything to say to me?
Won't you tell me where my love can be?
Is there a meadow in the mist
Where someone's waiting to be kissed?

Skylark
Have you seen a valley green with spring?
Where my heart can go a journeying
Over the shadows and the rain
To a blossom covered lane

And in your lonely flight
Haven't you heard the music in the night?
Wonderful music, faint as a will o' the wisp
Crazy as a loon, sad as a gypsy serenading the moon

Oh skylark
I don't know if you can find these things
But my heart is riding on your wings
So if you see them anywhere
Won't you lead me there?

Oh skylark
I don't know if you can find these things
But my heart is riding on your wings
So if you see them anywhere
Won't you lead me there?",Skylark,2016
Massimo Ciolli,"No one here can love or understand me
Oh, what hard luck stories they all hand me
Pack up all my cares and woe, here I go, winging low
Bye, bye, blackbird

Where somebody waits for me
Sugar's sweet, so is she
Bye, bye, blackbird

No one here can love or understand me
Oh, what hard luck stories they all hand me
Make my bed and light the light, I'll arrive late tonight

Massimo Ciolli,"You don't know what love is
'Til you've learned the meaning of the blues
Until you've loved a love you've had  to lose,
You don't know what love  is.

You don't know how lips hurt
Until you've kissed and had to pay the cost,
Until you've flipped your heart and you have lost,
You don't know what love is.

Do you know how a lost heart fears
At the thought of reminiscing,
And how lips that taste of tears
Lose their taste for kissing?
You don't know how hearts burn
For love that can, not live yet never dies.
Until you've faced each dawn with sleepless eyes,
You don't know what love is.",You Don't Know What Love Is,

I can see the stars come thru my room
While your loving attitude
Is like a flame that lights the gloom
On the wings of ev'ry kiss 
Drift a melody so strange and sweet
In this sentimental bliss you make my 
Paradise complete
Rose pearls seem to fall
It's all like a dream to call you mine
My heart's lighter thing 
Since you made me this night a thing divine

That you'd be loving sentimental me

Massimo Colombo,"The look of love
Is in your eyes
A look your smile can't 
disguise

The look of love
Is saying so much more than
Just words could every say
And what my heart has heard
Well it takes my breath away

[Chorus]
I can hardly wait to hold you
Feel my arms around you
How long I have waited
Waited just to love you
Now that I have found you

You've got the look of love
It's on your face
A look that time can't erase
Baby be mine, tonight

Let this be just the start of 
So many nights like this
Let's take a lovers vow
And seal it with a kiss

[Chorus]

Don't ever go
Don't ever go
I love you so

So many nights like this
Let's take a lover's vow
And baby we'll seal it with a kiss

Massimo Di Cataldo,"Guardami negli occhi, ora sto per dirti che 
non avrò paura di restare senza te 
se adesso te ne vai non me ne frega niente 
domani è un altro giorno ricomincerò 
E non avrò rancore quando parlerò di noi 
nasconderò il dolore come non ho fatto mai 
ma non mi dire adesso che ti dovrei capire 
perdonami ma io non ti perdonerò 

Se adesso te ne vai e fai crollare il mondo su di me 
adesso te ne vai ed io non vivo più 
lo so mi abituerò a camminare senza averti accanto 
non è così per te che lo sapevi già 

L'ultima valigia e poi tutto cambierà 
e già qualcuno aspetta per portarti via di qua 
spero soltanto che stavolta sia per sempre 
ma quanto male fa doverti dire che 

Se adesso te ne vai, non ci sarà più posto dentro me 
ti giuro d'ora in poi non so più chi sei 
trascina via con te le tue incertezze e la tua ipocrisia 
ma il male che mi fai non puoi portarlo via 

Diventerà un scudo con il quale mi difenderò da te 
e adesso sbatti forte quella porta via da me... 

E maledico il giorno che ci ha unito 
e questo che ti vede andare via, non mi rimane che un saluto 
abbasserò la testa e così sia... 

Se adesso te ne vai e fai crollare tutto su di me 
ti giuro d'ora in poi non so più chi sei 
se adesso te ne vai ti chiedo solo non voltarti mai 
perché non ci sarò se un giorno tornerai... 

Guardami negli occhi, ora sto per dirti che 
mentre tu mi lasci io rinasco senza te...",Se Adesso Te Ne Vai,1996
Massimo Di Cataldo,"Spegni il motore anche tu 
Che questa notte sia capirsi di più 
Per non volare più via 
Frecce nel nulla inconcludente pazzia 

Deceleriamo dai 
Prodezze no, non pagano mai 
Inutilmente eroi 
Se è vita se vuoi seguila non sfidarla 

Vai sereno incontro al tuo tempo 
Sai, si viaggia meglio sognando 
Vai amandoti un po' di più 
E arrivi laggiù 
Dai guai non ti allontani correndo
E poi perché ci stiamo perdendo noi 
In strane malinconie 
E assurde fobie? 

Un paio d'ali e poi 
Usarle bene però non è facile mai 
Precari amori voi 
Spazzati via dagli imprevisti venti 

Noi in gara con le emozioni 
Noi che non sentiamo ragioni 
Noi invulnerabili, no 
Più soli si può 
E se in questo assurdo momento c`è 
Malessere e smarrimento è lì 
Che inaspettato uno schianto 
È un triste risveglio 
La corsa finisce così 
La corsa finisce così 
La corsa finisce così 

Era un sabato speciale
Che peccato",Fine Corsa,1996
Massimo Di Cataldo,"Insieme a te io potrei 
Scoprire un mondo che non ho visto mai 
Lasciarmi andare come vorresti tu 

Prendere quota, planare giù 

Insieme a me tu puoi 
Far nascere il sole ogni volta che vuoi 
Dimenticare ogni paura che hai 
Saperti dare proprio come mi vai 

Fammi entrare dentro di te 
Neli occhi tuoi, vedo rinascere il mondo 
Dammi una ragione di più quella ragione sei tu
Per dare vita ad un sogno 
Lascia che sia parte di te 
E tu di me fino in fondo, rallentando
Ora si

Sfiorare il cielo ridiscendere giù 
Spingersi ancora in alto dove vuoi tu 

Fammi entrare dentro di te 
Negli occhi tuoi, vedo rinascere il mondo 
Dammi una ragione di più quella ragione sei tu
Per dare vita ad un sogno 
Noi che siamo fatti di noi 
Nei miei respiri vivono i tuoi 

È come un fiume in piena oramai 
Rompe gli argini suoi 
Dentro di te, se tu lo vuoi 
C'è, già sta vivendo
Siamo noi 

Dammi una ragione per vivere 
Una volta di più 
Quella ragione sei tu 
Dammi una ragione di più 
Quella ragione sei tu 
Per dare vita ad un sogno 
Ora sono parte di te, e tu di me fino in fondo 
Dal profondo di noi",Una Ragione Di Più,2001
