Erroll Garner Trio,"Our little dream castle with every dream gone,
Is lonely and silent, the shades are all drawn,
And my heart is heavy as I gaze upon
A cottage for sale

The lawn we were proud of is waving in hay,
Our beautiful garden has withered away,
Where you planted roses,the weeds seem to say,
A cottage for sale.

From every single window, I see your face,
But when I reach a window, there's empty space.
The key's in the mail box the same as before,
But no one is waiting any more,
The end of the story is told on the door.
A cottage for sale.",A Cottage for Sale,1998
Erroll Garner Trio,"Yesterday you came my way,
And when you smiled at me,
In my heart I felt a thrill you see,
That it was love at sight and
I was right to love you as I do.
Still I never dreamed that you could love me too.

Your eyes of blue, your kisses too,
I never knew what they could do.
I can't believe that you're in love with me.

You're telling ev'ry one I know
I'm on your mind each place we go
They can't believe that you're in love with me.

I have always placed you far above me.
I just can't imagine that you love me.
And after all is said and done,
To think that I'm the lucky one.
I can't believe that you're in love with me.

Skies are gray. I'm blue each day
When you are not around.
Ev'ry thing goes wrong, my dear I've found
But when you're by my side I fill with pride
For I'm so proud of you
It all seems too good to me to all be true

Your eyes of blue, your kisses too,
I never knew what they could do.
I can't believe that you're in love with me.

You're telling ev'ry one I know
I'm on your mind each place we go
They can't believe that you're in love with me.

I have always placed you far above me.

Erroll Garner Trio,"I cover the waterfront,
I'm watching the sea,,
Will the one I love,
Be coming back to me?

I cover the waterfront,
In search of my love,
And I'm covered by,
A starless sky above.

Here am I,
Patiently waiting,
Hoping and longing,
Oh! How I yearn!
Where are you?
Are you forgetting?
Do you remember?
Will you return?

I cover the waterfront,
I'm watching the sea,
For the one I love,
Must come back to me.",I Cover the Waterfront,1998
Erroll Garner Trio,"I need your love so badly, I love you, oh, so madly
But I don't stand a ghost of a chance with you!
I thought at last I'd found you, but other lovers surround you
And ""I don't stand a ghost of a chance with you!""
If you'd surrender just for a tender kiss or two
You might discover, that I'm the lover meant for you
And I'd be true, but what's the good of scheming
I know I must be dreaming",I Don't Stand a Ghost of a Chance With You,1998
Erroll Garner Trio,"My love must be a kind of blind love
I can't see anyone but you
Sha bop sha bop

Are the stars out tonight
I don't know if it's cloudy or bright
I only have eyes for you dear

The moon may be high
But I can't see a thing in the sky
I only have eyes for you

I don't know if we're in a garden
Or on a crowded avenue

You are here and so am I
Maybe millions of people go by
But they all disappear from view
And I only have eyes for you",I Only Have Eyes for You,1998
Erroll Garner Trio,"Pride, sad, splendid liar,  
Sworn enemy of love
Kept my lips from saying
Things I was thinking of.
But now my pride you've humbled,
I've cast it to the winds,
Broken, beaten, sick at heart
My confession begins.
 
We've played the game of stay away
But it cost more that I can pay.
Without you I can't make my way,
I surrender, dear.

I may seem proud, I may act gay,
It's just a pose, I'm not that way,
'Cause deep down in my heart I say
I surrender, dear.

Little mean things we were doing
Must have been part of the game,
Lending a spice to the wooing,
But I don't care who's to blame.
When stars appear and shadows fall,
Why then you'll hear My poor heart call,
To you my love, my life, my all
I surrender, dear.

Erroll Garner Trio,"Love walked right in and drove the shadows away
Love walked right in and brought my sunniest day
One magic moment and my heart seemed to know that love said hello
Though not a word was spoken

One look, and I forgot the gloom of the past
One look and I had found my future at last
One look and I had found a world completely new
When love walked in with you

One magic moment and my heart seemed to know that love said hello

Erroll Garner Trio,"Whether you are here or yonder, 
Whether you are false or true
Whether you remain or wander, 
I'm growing fonder of you
Even though your friends forsake you, 
Even though you don't succeed
Wouldn't I be glad to take you, 
Give you the break you need

More than you know, more than you know
Girl of my heart, I love you so
Lately I find you're on my mind
More than you know

Whether you're right, whether you're wrong
Girl of my heart, I'll string along
You need me so
Much more than you'll ever know (ever know)        
Loving you the way that I do      
  
There's nothing I can do about it        
Loving may be all you can give        
But baby I can't live without it
Oh, how I'd cry, oh, how I'd cry
If you got tired and said ""Good-bye""

More than I'd show
More than you'd ever know",More Than You Know,1998
Erroll Garner Trio,"Somewhere over the rainbow, way up high
There's a land that I've heard of once in a lullaby.
Somewhere over the rainbow, skies are blue
And the dreams that you dare to dream,
Really do come true.

Someday I'll wish upon a star
And wake up where the clouds are far behind me.
Where troubles melt like lemon drops,
High above the chimney tops,
That's where you'll find me.

Somewhere over the rainbow, blue birds fly
Birds fly over the rainbow
Why then, oh why can't I?
If happy little bluebirds fly beyond the rainbow
Why, oh why can't I?

Somewhere over the rainbow, way up high
There's a land that I've heard of once in a lullaby.
Somewhere over the rainbow, skies are blue
And the dreams that you dare to dream,
Really do come true.

And wake up where the clouds are far behind me.
Where troubles melt like lemon drops,
High above the chimney tops,

Erroll Garner Trio,"Just picture a penthouse way up in the sky
With hinges on chimneys for stars to go by
A sweet slice of Heaven for just you and I
When we're alone.

From all of society we'll stay aloof
And live in propriety there on the roof.
Two heavenly hermits we will be in truth
When we're alone.

We'll see life's mad pattern
As we view old Manhattan
Then we can thank our lucky stars
That we're living as we are.

In our little penthouse we'll always contrive
To keep love and romance forever alive
In view of the Hudson just over the drive,
When we're alone.

Erroll Garner Trio,"Oh, it's a long, long while from May to December
But the days grow short when you reach September
When the autumn weather turns the leaves to flame
One hasn't got time for the waiting game

Oh, the days dwindle down to a precious few
September, November
And these few precious days I'll spend with you
These precious days I'll spend with you",September Song,1998
Erroll Garner Trio,"Don't worry 'bout me
I'll get along
Forget about me
Just be happy my love

Let's say that our little show is over
And so the story ends
Why not call it a day the sensible way
And still be friends

Look out for yourself
That should be the rule
Give your heart and your love
To whomever you love
Darlin' don't be a fool

Why do we cling to this old faded thing
That used to be
So if you can forget
Then don't worry 'bout me

Why should we cling to some old faded thing

So if you can forget
Then you don't worry 'bout me",Don't Worry 'Bout Me,1998
Erroll Garner Trio,"And now the purple dusk of twilight time
Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb
Always reminding me that we're apart
You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms
The nightingale 
Tells his fairytale
Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain
My stardust melody
The memory of love's refrain.",Stardust,1998
Erroll Garner Trio,"Black cats creep across my path
Until I'm almost mad
I must have 'roused the devil's wrath
Cause all my luck is bad
I make a date for golf and you can bet your life it rains
I try to give a party and the guy upstairs complains
I guess I'll go through life 
Just catchin' colds and missin' trains

Everything happens to me
I never miss a thing
I've had the measles and the mumps
And every time I play an ace
My partner always trumps
Guess I'm just a fool who never looks before he jumps

Everything happens to me
At first my heart thought you could break this jinx for me
That love would turn the trick to end despair
But know I just can't fool this head that thinks for me
I've mortgaged all my castles in the air
I've telegraphed and phoned
I send an ""Airmail Special"" too
Your answer was ""Goodbye""
And there was even postage due
I fell in love just once
And then it had to be with you

Everything happens to me",Everything Happens to Me,1999
Erroll Garner Trio,"Walked with no one and talked with no one
And I had nothing but shadows
Then one morning you passed
And I brightened at last
Now I greet the day and complete the day
With the sun in my heart
All my worry blew away
When you taught me how to say

Grab your coat and get your hat
Leave your worry on the doorstep
Just direct your feet
To the sunny side of the street
Can't you hear a pitter-pat?
And that happy tune is your step
Life can be so sweet
On the sunny side of the street

I used to walk in the shade
With those blues on parade
But I'm not afraid
This Rover crossed over

If I never have a cent
I'd be rich as Rockefeller
Gold dust at my feet
On the sunny side of the street
Grab your street",On the Sunny Side of the Street,1999

When the deep purple falls
Over sleepy garden walls
And the stars begin to twinkle in the night
In the mist of a memory
You wander all back to me
Breathing my name with a sigh

In the still of the night
Once again I hold you tight
Tho' you're gone your love lives on when light beams
And as long as my heart will beat
Sweet lover, we'll always meet
Here in my deep purple dreams

Erroll Garner Trio,"I let a song go out of my heart
It was the sweetest melody
I know I lost heaven 'cause you were the song

Since you and I have drifted apart
Life doesn't mean a thing to me
Please come back, sweet music, I know I was wrong

Am I too late to make amends?
You know that we were meant to be more than just friends, just friends

Believe me, darlin', when I say
I won't know sweet music until you return some day

I whisper your name
Through a long and sleepless night

Can't help but wonder
If you're lonely too
As I lie here and toss about
So alone, so without you
How I wish, my heart with me

My memories alone
Why must I re-dream, re-live
The Joys we have known

In thick dark silence I beg my heart to replace

I've got you deep in the heart of me.
So deep in my heart that you're really a part of me.
I've got you under my skin.
I'd tried so not to give in.
I said to myself, this affair never will go so well.
But why should I try to resist when, baby, I know down well
I've got you under my skin?

I'd sacrifice anything come what might
For the sake of havin' you near
In spite of a warnin' voice that comes in the night
And repeats, repeats in my ear,
Don't you know, you fool, you never can win?
Use your mentality, wake up to reality.
But each time that I do just the thought of you
Makes me stop before I begin
Cause I've got you under my skin.

I would sacrifice anything come what might
For the sake of havin' you near
In spite of the warning voice that comes in the night

But it cost more that I can pay.
Without you I can't make my way,
I surrender, dear.

I may seem proud, I may act gay,
It's just a pose, I'm not that way,
'Cause deep down in my heart I say
I surrender, dear.

Little mean things we were doing
Must have been part of the game,
Lending a spice to the wooing,
But I don't care who's to blame.
When stars appear and shadows fall,
Why then you'll hear My poor heart call,
To you my love, my life, my all
I surrender, dear.

Oh! Will you never set me free?
The ties that bound us
Are still around us

That bring me happiness or pain

A cigarette that bears a lipstick's traces
An airline ticket to romantic places
And still my heart has wings

A tinkling piano in the next apartment
Those stumbling words that told you what my heart meant
A fair ground's painted swings

A telephone that rings but who's to answer?

First daffodils and long excited cables
And candle lights on little corner tables
And still my heart has wings

The ""Ile de France"" with all the gulls around it
The beauty that is Spring's
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The sigh of midnight trains in empty stations
Silk stockings thrown aside dance invitations
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

Gardenia perfume ling'ring on a pillow
Wild strawb'ries only seven francs a kilo
And still my heart has wings

The smile of Garbo and the scent of roses
The waiters whistling as the last bar closes
The song that Crosby sings
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The scent of smould'ring leaves, the wail of steamers
Two lovers on the street who walk like dreamers

Erwin Helfer,"Back down memory lane, I began as my mother's bright idea
A short time later they all watched in awe and all of a sudden I'm here
She was also my father so I hardly got to see her
I was afraid of the dark, but it was only 'cause I was a believer

I was told when I was two years old
She swore that I would be special
I took a good look around and thought
Don't worry mama this city's gonna help ya

Georgia, you'll always be home to me
Georgia, I belong to you and yes you belong to me
When they ask me where I'm from
I'm proud to say that I'm your son

I'm movin' on using mostly dirt roads until I find my way
Campbellton Road, can't forget Cascade or remember both MLK
There's somethin' about Atlanta, doesn't cease to amaze me
Oh, after all you even raised the people that raised me

And my old man is very dead, can't be mad now why bother?
And you have been my mother nature also my godfather

Georgia, you'll always be home to me
Georgia, I belong to you and yes you belong to me
When they ask me where I'm from
I'm proud to say that I'm your son

Erwin Helfer,"Walked with no one and talked with no one
And I had nothing but shadows
Then one morning you passed
And I brightened at last
Now I greet the day and complete the day
With the sun in my heart
All my worry blew away
When you taught me how to say

Grab your coat and get your hat
Leave your worry on the doorstep
Just direct your feet
To the sunny side of the street
Can't you hear a pitter-pat?
And that happy tune is your step
Life can be so sweet
On the sunny side of the street

I used to walk in the shade
With those blues on parade
But I'm not afraid
This Rover crossed over

If I never have a cent
I'd be rich as Rockefeller
Gold dust at my feet
On the sunny side of the street
Grab your street",On the Sunny Side of the Street,2005
Erwin Nyhoff,"You're my morning star
Shining brightly beside me
And if we keep this love
It would last through all eternity

Just the way we are
Our love story
It's just the way it should be

[Chorus 1]
Cause our love
Will stand tall as the trees
Our love
Will spread as wide as the sea
Our love
Will shine bright in the night
Like the stars above
And we'll always be together
Our love

My love is surely one thing
You can surely depend on
In times of darkness and fear
I go to you
I know you'll make me strong

You're gonna make me happy
You're gonna make me smile

[Chorus 2]
Our love
Will stand tall as the trees
Our love
Will be for the whole world to see
Our love
Will change people's wrongs to rights
And will never die
Cause we'll always have each other

[Chorus 1]

Break it down
Just a little
Because love is soft, love is sweet
Love is nice, love is gentle
Love is joy, love is pain
Love is laughing in the rain
I got love on my mind
Love is always right on time
Love is you, love is me
Love is just a little baby
(our love) I got love on my mind
Love is always right on time
Love is you, love is me
Love is gonna set me free

Tellin' the world about the joy you bring
And you gave me reason for living 
And oh, you taught me the meaning of giving
 
Oh, oh! heaven must have sent you from above
Oh, heaven must have sent your precious love

'Cause you've shown me what happiness is in so many ways
I look in the mirror and I'm glad 
To see laughter in the eyes where tears used 
To be
 
What you've given me I could never return
'Cause there's so much girl I've yet to learn
And I want to show my appreciation, cause when I found you
I found a new inspiration

Now, I ain't sayin' that this life don't work
But it's me and baby that he hurts
Cause I tell him right
He thinks I'm wrong
But I love him strong

He gave me the life that I came to live
Gave me the song that I came to give
Pressure on me
But the seed had grown
I can't make it on my own
Summer came around and the flowers bloomed
He became the sun
I became the moon
Precious gifts that we both received
Or could this be make believe

Work ain't honest but it pays the bills
What we gonna do when they come for you
Gave me the life that I came to live

God's gonna see us through

First time that I saw you boy

Well as I universally greet the whole entire world
And focus on the energy that'll make your skin curl
The one strategy, the one universal plan
The master blueprint, one survival for all man
I Self Lord - AM, so divine
When me and my woman coincide as one mind; bear witness
One respect, one culture, one way of thinkin'
One vision, makin the one decision on one WAY of livin'!
Common destiny amongst all
One understanding amongst me and my woman, so that we can't fall
And keep movin' forward based on actual fact
Yes y'all, my beautiful Mother Earth, respect her to the max
Can't mix dilute or tamper with us no more
We on the highest form of emotion, holy sacred and pure
And what's mines is yours, especially if we move
In the same direction just for ONE common cause

Just one - opportunity to handle our biz
Just one - mind state so we can equally live
Just one - you know we only have one life to live
Just one - come together as one

As one - one family
As one - one little kiss now
As one - one entirety
As one - and let us all uplift now (talk to me baby)

I value (uh-huh uh huh) that I've found me (what what)
I gave you tea (that's right girl) you shed degree (oh yes love)
A family (one family baby) is what we be (uh-huh, uh-huh yea)
So that you'll see (right)

Aiyyo, aiyyo
I know my woman's love for me, the way she cherish me
Fulfill my every appetite for the God Degree
Always inspire my encouragement, the right amount of nourishment
Secure enough so I don't have to ask her where my lovin' went
When times is hopeless, sometimes I had to focus
on the priceless moments, when my Wisdom Body wouldn't notice
Cause you're my everything, what's mines'll be yours

As one - one little kiss now
As one - one entirety
As one - so let us all uplift now

As my sunlight, I bear witness to you
Being the foundation, you can come home and watch the babies too
(The one way we agree on how to follow tradition)
This one family come in thirds, play your position
You make the sacrifices, I make the same too
(From all the struggle) that I see, that's why my love is for you

You always hold it down for me, so I'ma hold it for you
And watch the babies while you secure the food to come through

Now don't let my ambition make you feel like competition
We should both play a role in our whole livin' condition (true indeed)
I know you symbolize the strength inside the family
Then show me you can handle womanly responsibilities

Not a problem I know you hold me down when I fall on the ground
But make sure when you bring the food home there's enough to go 'round
And because you are my everything what's mine is yours
Movin' in the same direction, just for one common cause

Oh, Well hold up, listen partna, I ain't no cheap thrill
Cause Miss Badu is always comin' for real you know the deal, nigga

Every time we go somewhere, I gotta reach down in my purse
To pay your way and your homeboys way and sometimes your cousin's way

They don't never have to pay, don't have no cars
Hang around in bars try to hang around with stars

I been or who I saw or
What club I went to with my homies
Baby don't worry you know that you got me

If you were worried 'bout where
I been or who I saw or
What club I went to with my homies
Baby don't worry you know that you got me

Somebody told me that this planet was small
We use to live in the same building on the same floor
And never met before
Until I'm overseas on tour
And peep this Ethiopian queen from Philly
Taking classes abroad
She studying film and photo flash focus record
Said she workin on a flick and
Could my click do the score
She said she loved my show in Paris
At Elysee Montmartre
And that I stepped off the stage
And took a piece of her heart
We knew from the start that
Things fall apart, intentions shatter
She like that shit don't matter
When I get home get at her
Through letter, phone, whatever
Let's link, let's get together
Shit you think not, think the Thought went home and forgot
Time passed, we back in Philly now she up in my spot
Tellin me the things I'm tellin her is makin her hot
Startin buildin with her constantly round the clock
Now she in my world like hip-hop
And keep tellin me

If you were worried 'bout where
I been or who I saw or
What club I went to with my homies
Baby don't worry you know that you got me

If you were worried 'bout where
I been or who I saw or
What club I went to with my homies
Baby don't worry you know that you got me

Yo, I'm the type that's always catchin a flight
And sometimes I gotta be out at the height of the night
And that's when she flip and get on some 'ol
Another lonely night
Seems like I'm on the side you only loving your mic
I know you gotta get that paper daddy keep that shit tight
But yo I need some sort of love in my life, you dig me
While politicin with my sister from New York City
She said she know this ball player and he think I'm pretty
Psych, I'm playin boo, you know it's just wit you I'm stayin boo
And when cats be poppin game I don't hear what they sayin boo
When you out there in the world, I'm still your girl
With all my classes I don't have the time for life's thrills
So when you sweatin on stage think of me when you rhyme
And don't be listenin to your homies they be leavin you blind

Yeah, so what you sayin I can trust you?
Is you crazy, you my king for real
But sometimes relationships get ill
No doubt

If you were worried 'bout where
I been or who I saw or
What club I went to with my homies
Baby don't worry you know that you got me

If you were worried 'bout where
I been or who I saw or
What club I went to with my homies
Baby don't worry you know that you got me

That snake could be that chick
And that rat could be that cool cat
That's whispering ""she tryin to play you for the fool Black""
If something's on your chest then let it be known
See I'm not your every five minutes all on the phone
And on the topic of trust, it's just a matter of fact
That people bite back and fracture what's intact
And they'll forever be I ain't on some ""oh I'm a celebrity""
I deal with the real so if it's artificial let it be
I've seen people caught in love like whirlwinds
Listening to they squads and listening to girlfriends
That's exactly the point where they whole world ends
Lies come in, that's where that drama begins, she like",You Got Me,1999

I never knew a luh, luh luh, a love like this
Gotta be somethin' for me to write this
Queen, I ain't seen you in a minute
Wrote this letter and finally decide to send it

Signed, sealed, delivered for us to grow together
Love has no limit, let's spend it slow forever
I know your heart is weathered by what studs did to you
I ain't gon' assault 'em 'cause I probably did it too

Because of you feelings I handle with care
Some niggaz recognize the light but they can't handle the glare
You know I ain't the type to walk around with matchin' shirts
If relationship is effort I will match your work

I wanna be the one to make you happiest, it hurts you the most
They say the end is near, it's important that we close
To the most, high
Regardless of what happen on him let's rely

There are times when you'll need someone
I will be by your side
There is a light that shines
Special for you and me
Yo, yo, check it

It's important we communicate
And tune the fate of this union to the right pitch
I never call you my bitch or even my boo
There's so much in a name and so much more in you

Few understand the union of woman and man
And sex and a tingle is where they assume that it land
But that's fly by night for you and the sky I write
For in these cold star night's moon, you my light

If heaven had a height, you would be that tall
Ghetto to coffee shop, through you I see that all
Let's stick to understandin' and we won't fall
For better or worse times, I hope to me you call

So I pray everyday more than anything friends will stay as we begin to lay
This foundation for a family love ain't simple
Why can't it be anything worth having you work at annually?
Granted we known each other for some time
It don't take a whole day to recognize sunshine

There are times when you'll need someone
I will be by your side, oh darling
There is a light that shines
Special for you and me
Yeah, yo, yo, check it

It's kinda fresh you listen to more than hip-hop
And I can catch you in the mix from beauty to thrift shop
Plus you ship hop when it's time to, thinkin' you fresh
Suggestin' beats I should rhyme to

At times when I'm lost I try to find you
You know to give me space when it's time to
My heart's dictionary defines you, it's love and happiness
Truthfully it's hard tryin' to practice abstinence

The time we committed love it was real good
Had to be for me to arrive and it still feel good
I know the sex ain't gon' keep you, but as my equal
It's how I must treat you

As my reflection in light I'm a lead you
And whatever's right, I'm a feed you
Digga da, digga da, digga da, digga digga da da
Yo I tell you the rest when I see you, peace

There are times when you'll need someone
I will be by your side
There is a light, that shines
Special for you and me
I'll take my chances before they pass, pass, pass
Pass me by, oh darling
You need to look at the other side
You'll agree",The Light Remix (For You),2000
Erykah Badu,"[Chorus One: Erykah Badu] 
When she wants plenty, she gets plenty 
When she wants plenty, she gets plenty 
When she wants plenty, she gets plenty 
then she gets plenty more, uhh 

{repeat Chorus One} 
[Guru] 
Uhh 
Watchin her drivin by, in her new whip so fly 
Wish she could sing me a lullaby, to scoop her I've got to try 
In her eyes, there's a flame that burns right through my soul 
Can't pretend to be cool, about to lose my control 
Yeah I know she's got plenty; admirers, she's got many 
Like an exotic fantasy, into a frenzy she sends me 
Wow I have to sit down, and gather my wits now 
I want to caress those hips now, want to kiss those lips now 

[Badu] 
Hello? Hey babyyy 
I know you called and I didn't answer twice 
But baby that's oh-kay it's nice 
for you to call anyway see, okay, see uhh 
Hey babyyy 
You know it's okay if you don't call me 
anymore cause I got a-plenty 
truckload of niggaz like you at my door {*dial tone*} 

[Chorus One] 
[Guru] 
Yup 
And every day is her day, and every year is her year 
Anyone tried to violate, they could straight disappear 
She don't care if you play yourself, tryin to step to her 
The illest of gangsters, I show and respect to her 
Truly glamourous, she ain't impressed and it shows 
She don't like your new clothes, she don't care about your playa pose 
Do you suppose I could hook up and spend time with her? 
She's just how I dreamed - I'll bust my nine for her 

[Chorus Two: Erykah Badu] 
When she gets plenty, she gets plenty 
When she gets plenty, she gets plenty 
When she wants plenty, she gets plenty 
any damn thang she wants, uhh 

[Guru] 
Uhh 
Surgeon General - I provide vitamins and minerals 
The charge that she's got on me, should be federal 
I was told never put the two before the one son 
but always cultivate your Wisdom, to help you build your kingdom 
I want to be the answer to every question she has 
So when I wish to enter, she'll be lettin me pass 
I know she wants to be with G-O-D eventually, but still 
She got everything; yeah the girl's got plenty 

[Badu] 
Flowers in her bedroom 
Perfume on her neck 
Nectar from a mason jar 
Seven dollar dress; she's 
Super cute, and plenty bad 
Thirty twenty-two thirty-six and a half 
I, hope the dude will realize 
She got the silky(?) (?)sexy bedroom eyes 
Baby baby please don't break yo' neck 
Cause you gon' have a wreck {*tires squeal*} 
Cause when it comes to love I get plenty, degrees one-twenty 
My back slipped out my dress - OOPS! 

[Chorus Three: Erykah Badu] 
When she gets plenty, she gets plenty (she gets it all) 
When she wants plenty, she gets plenty (uhh) 
When she wants plenty, she gets plenty (c'mon) 
and she gets plenty more (plenty more) ahh 
When she wants plenty, she gets plenty 
When she wants plenty, she gets plenty (mm, she gets it all) 
When she wants plenty, she gets plenty 
and any damn thang I want - right? 

[Guru] 
That's right 
In this game of life it takes a lot to win 
Plenty more baby's what I got to give 

[Badu] 
Yeah yeah baby that's really nice 
But I'm tryin to read my book and you're in my light 

[Guru] 
Uhh - a woman like you could help me reach the top 
If I get a chance to love you, mm, I won't stop 

[Badu] 
Damn! Oh huh, what? Huh, whaaat? 
I didn't hear you I was thinkin bout some stuff 

[Guru] 
Baby you so fine I want to smack myself 
I don't need no support I'm gonna back myself 

[Badu] 
Hooo baby you so sweet 
Now can you get the lotion and rub my feets 

[Guru] 
In massage therapy I got a master degree 
I give you plenty more, than what you askin from me 

[Badu] 
I need a little bit of space, a little bit of wealth (okay) 
And oh - about the feets, a little to the left (like this?) 
Mmmmmm (m'hmm, like that?) 
Yeahhh (feels good right?) 
Ohhhhh 
Ahhhhh (yeah, heh heh) 
Hehehee! (You don't really care)

On and on and on and on
Wake the fuck up 'cause it's been too long
Say wait a minute, Queen
What's your name
I be that gypsy
Flippin' life game from the right brain
Ascension maintained
Rolling through like a burning flame
Like a super nova star
She be the light
When they in the dark
Morning
The moon pass the sun
Four constellations start forming
Across up in the sky
But everybody wanna ask me why

What good do your words do
If they can't understand you
Don't go talkin' that shit Badu, Badu

If they can't understand you
Don't go talkin' that shit Badu, Badu

Said I'm a Pisces
Zika deka del
Well well I'm raising hell
People always tryin' to find the world I'm in
I'm the envy of the women and I rule the men

Two fish, one swimmin' up stream
One swimmin' down livin' in a dream
But when she loves she tends to cling
When incense burns, smoke unfurls
Analog girl in a digital world
The rasta style flower child
Zip dip dow, zip dip dow
The gold tooth smile
Split them vowels
Bling bloom bling, melinated
I'm 'bout ta give birth to church
But everybody want to ask this earth
What'

Bridge!
I remember when I went
With Momma to the Washateria
Remember how I felt the day
I first started my period
Remember there in school one day
I learned I was inferior
Water in my cereal

Badu in your stereo
Holla if you hear me though
Remembering is good if you don't
Let it be the fear in you
Wrap ya head with this material

'Cause you did not do your math
My cipher keeps moving like a rolling stone
Mad props to God ja born

Things just ain't the same for singers
Gotta sing on the beat the bring us
But that's all I have ain't got no mo
But still the people really wanna to know

Erykah Badu,"[Chorus: Repeat 2X]
If you were worried 'bout where
I been or who I saw or
What club I went to with my homies
Baby don't worry you know that you got me

Somebody told me that this planet was small
We use to live in the same building on the same floor
And never met before
Until I'm overseas on tour 
And peep this ethiopian queen from philly 
Taking classes abroad
She studying film and photo flash focus record
Said she workin on a flick and
Could my click do the score
She said she loved my show in paris
At Elysee Montmartre
And that I stepped off the stage
And took a piece of her heart
We knew from the start that
Things fall apart, intentions shatter
She like that shit don't matter 
When I get home get at her
Through letter, phone, whatever
Let's link, let's get together
Shit you think not, think the thought went home and forgot
Time passed, we back in philly now she up in my spa
Tellin me the things I'm tellin her is makin her hot
Startin buildin' with her constantly round the clock
Now she in my world like hip-hop 
And keep tellin me

[Chorus:]

Yo, I'm the type that's always catchin' a flight
And sometimes I gotta be out at the height of the night
And that's when she flip and get on some 'ol

Another lonely night
Seems like I'm on the side you only loving your mic
I know you gotta get that paper daddy keep that shit tight
But yo I need some sort of love in my life, you dig me
While politicin with my sister from New York City
She said she know this ball player and he think I'm pretty
Psych, I'm playin boo, you know it's just wit you I'm stayin boo 
And when cats be poppin' game I don't hear what they sayin boo
When you out there in the world, I'm still your girl
With all my classes I don't have the time for life's thrills
So when you sweatin' on stage think of me when you rhyme
And don't be listenin' to your homies they be leavin you blind

Yeah, so what you sayin' I can trust you?
Is you crazy, you my king for real
But sometimes relationships get ill
No doubt

[Chorus:]

The snake could be that chick 
And that rat could be that cool cat
That's whispering ""she tryin' to play you for the fool Black""
If something's on your chest then let it be known
See I'm not your every five minutes all on the phone
And on the topic of trust, it's just a matter of fact
That people bite back and fracture what's intact
And they'll forever be I ain't on some ""oh I'm a celebrity""
I deal with the real so if it's artificial let it be
I've seen people caught in love like whirlwinds
Listening to they squads and listening to girlfriends
That's exactly the point where they whole world ends
Lies come in, that's where that drama begins, she like

Back on the microphone, your number one controller
I rock the microphone like a blizzard;
I'm so cold I'm tryin' to hold ya

Everything in life don't happen like it's suppose to
Trials and tribulations make you stronger live longer
You wanna reach the nation nigga start from ya corner
Everything in life don't always happen like you plan it
Demand it; over stand it then you handle it
Fuck wishing you, you missing the ambition on your mission
Now you switching why you quitting 'cause it's heated in the kitchen

We chicken nugget, we dip in the sauce like mop and bucket
Blue-collar scholars, who'll take your dollar and wipe my ass wit it
You livin for the lotto never hit it
I met a critic, I made her shit her drawers
She said she thought hip-hop was only guns and alcohol
I said ""Oh hell naw!""  But yet it's that too
You can't discrimi-hate cause you done read a book or two
What if I looked at you in a microscope, saw all the dirty organisms
Living in your closet would I stop and would I pause it?  Whoo!
To put that bitch in slower motion, got the potion and the antidote
And a quote for collision the decision.. is,
Do you want to live or wanna exist?
The game changes everyday so obsolete is the fist and marches
Speeches only reaches those who already know about it
This is how we go about it

And I'm free, just like the wind the breeze that blows
And I flow, just like a brook, a stream, the rain
And I fly, just like a bird up in the sky
And I'll surely die, just like a flower plucked
And dragged away and thrown away
And then 1 day it turns to clay
It blows away, it finds a ray, it finds its way
And there it lays until the rain and sun
Then I breathe, just like the wind the breeze that blows
And I grow, just like a baby breastfeeding
And it's beautiful, that's life and that's life
And that's life and that's life

Wasn't the only one
Cause when the tables turned
He had to break up

Whenever I got lonely
Or needed some advice
He gave me his shoulder
His words were very nice

But that is all behind me
Cause now there is no other

He's just a friend

He moved around and we kept

Erykah Badu,"Phone rang, screen said caller ID said blocked
But for some reason I decided to answer it
On the other end was a French accent
He told me we needed to rap quick
Cause he had did some bad shit
And would be gone for years, spending these last two days
With his momma and his kids
When he spoke I wasn't trying to hear it ,cause
I knew he was a real good person
And this didn't seem like it was in his spirit
He couldn't believe as much as I couldn't, what he done
He said now its time for him to turn himself in
No longer could he run, from life, from God
Start thinkin', why is doing right is so hard
I got back to him when we was in London discussin' the new testament
And how our lives related to it, and how we could make the best of it
My voice became destined, so I asked him why you gotta go
He said you know turn to Matthew twenty-four
He said no one knows the hour, nor do they know the day
But the kingdom is near, don't let anything lead you to stray
As long as God is with you, everything will be okay
So right about then, we decided to pray

Just lyin' back makin' the smoke disperse a ray
Deep into clouds
It's makin' things appear to me so clearly

Is a terrible to waste
For it's
Not one of the possessions that you can bring to space, yeah, it don't matter
Its a challenge
But the chance of seeing, is quite a dream to chase, yes it is
I hope
I remind God of him when he sees my face
He goin' see it

The feeling just keeps on lifting me higher
And its ever flowing it's, ever flowing
When every thing, puts a smile on my face
And I recognize the strong goal
But I keep on going, I keep on going
I keep on going on

Jimi come out why don't you set me free?

So high born to fly
Getting high off his own supply
Everybody follows the same Lord
Using his light to guide the way 
Try things but few die so young
Something among Jimi was stung

Sets behind a mask they wear

And he was my first

But in my heart I knew I
Wasn't the only one
Cause when the tables turned
He had to break up

Whenever I got lonely
Or needed some advice
He gave me his shoulder
His words were very nice

But that is all behind me
Cause now there is no other
My love is his and his is mine
A friend became the

Love of my life
You are my friend

Without you, baby
It feels like a simple true love

Hope this shit ain't clear
A freak-freak ya'll, and ya don't stop
To the beat ya'll and ya don't stop
A freak-freak

Or could it be that it was
All just so simple then
A teenage lover who said
He's just a friend

He moved around and we kept
In touch through his friend Mike
The world was young and he knew
We couldn't rush but

Whenever I got lonely
Or needed some advice
He gave me his shoulder
His words were very nice

But that is all behind me
Cause now there is no other
My love is his and his is mine

We broke up and got back together
To get her back I had to sweat her (sweat her)

Erykah Badu,"[Chorus: x2] 
If you were worried 'bout where 
I been or who I saw or 
What club I went to with my homies 
Baby don't worry you know that you got me 

Somebody told me that this planet was small 
We use to live in the same building on the same floor 
And never met before 
Until I'm overseas on tour 
And peep this Ethiopian queen from Philly 
Taking classes abroad 
She studying film and photo flash focus record 
Said she workin' on a flick and 
Could my click do the score 
She said she loved my show in Paris 
At Elysee Montmartre 
And that I stepped off the stage 
And took a piece of her heart 
We knew from the start that 
Things fall apart, intentions shatter 
She like that shit don't matter 
When I get home get at her 
Through letter, phone, whatever 
Let's link, let's get together 
Shit you think not, think the Thought went home and forgot 
Time passed, we back in Philly now she up in my spot 
Tellin' me the things I'm tellin' her is makin' her hot 
Startin' buildin' with her constantly round the clock 
Now she in my world like hip-hop 
And keep tellin' me 

[Chorus: x2] 

Yo, I'm the type that's always catchin' a flight 
And sometimes I gotta be out at the height of the night 
And that's when she flip and get on some 'ol 

Another lonely night 
Seems like I'm on the side you only loving your mic 
I know you gotta get that paper daddy keep that shit tight 
But yo I need some sort of love in my life, you dig me 
While politicin' with my sister from New York City 
She said she know this ball player and he think I'm pretty 
Sike, I'm playin' boo, you know it's just wit you I'm stayin' boo 
And when cats be poppin game I don't hear what they sayin' boo 
When you out there in the world, I'm still your girl 
With all my classes I don't have the time for life's thrills 
So when you sweatin' on stage think of me when you rhyme 
And don't be listenin' to your homies they be leavin' you blind 

Yeah, so what you sayin' I can trust you? 

Is you crazy, you my king for real 

But sometimes relationships get ill 
 
No doubt 

[Chorus: x2] 

That snake could be that chick 
And that rat could be that cool cat 
That's whispering ""she tryin' to play you for the fool Black"" 
If something's on your chest then let it be known 
See I'm not your every five minutes all on the phone 
And on the topic of trust, it's just a matter of fact 
That people bite back and fracture what's intact 
And they'll forever be I ain't on some ""oh I'm a celebrity"" 
I deal with the real so if it's artificial let it be 
I've seen people caught in love like whirlwinds 
Listening to they squads and listening to girlfriends 
That's exactly the point where they whole world ends 
Lies come in, that's where that drama begins, she like
 
[Chorus]

What we are against is those thugs""",You Got Me [Live],2006

Bankin' new york shakin' up the apollo

Booby like tooties that fog up ya goggles

I got the notion to get real close
That's a little ? motion don't mind if I boast
Baby I can be yea favorite host
Break yea off wit a single or a freaky double dose
Just don't catch no emotions

Beats and rhymes is my devotion

Talib, T'Kwi, Kweli, I can't say it!
That's wack

Yeah, you pronounce my name (Kweli), any questions?
I bring many blessings with my man Hi-Tek and he from the Natti (Natti)
We make the sky crack, feel the fly track
Get your hands up like a hijack
Fist in the air for (Kweli), keep 'em there like
Natural mystic or smoke when they spliffs lit
It's a revolutionary (party), they ask me what I'm writing for
I'm writing to show you what we fighting for
Say Taleeb or Talib (Kweli), if it's hard try spelling in phonetically
If not then just let it be like Nina Simone
You probably (ably) don't listen be	
Even when we suffer loses I account the victory
Sometimes it's far and between I'm sad to say
It got my brain crowded like sunset on a Saturday
I know my son wept cause his dad's away
Stop crying be strong is what I had to say
To my little man named Amani (mani)

Start the party, my crew hot feel these two shots
Like the blast from a double barrel shottie (shottie)
It's got to be, your man Hi-Tek and Kweli
Who make you rock your body (body)

I remember when it all started
Back in the day when me and moms first parted
Hi-Tek from the beginning I stayed advanced
A young chameleon, adapt to any circumstance
Peep game nigga, never been a lazy nigga
Stayed on my hustle, concentrate to get the paper bigger
Stay focused while other cats stay hopeless
While niggas stay high I stay lower
Stacking my chips to get a foreclosure, this shit ain't over
Going for the gusto, keep getting that provo,
It's Hi-Tek (and Kweli) on the track like Flow Jo
Bet you ain't even know I had flow though

Start the party, my crew hot feel these two shots
Like the blast from a double barrel shottie (shottie)
It's got to be, your man Hi-Tek and Kweli

Erykah Badu,"I never knew a luh, luh-luh, a love like this
Gotta be something for me to write this
Queen, I ain't seen you in a minute
Wrote this letter, and finally decide to send it
Signed sealed delivered for us to grow together
Love has no limit, let's spend it slow forever
I know your heart is weathered by what studs did to you
I ain't goin' assault em cause I probably did it too
Because of you, feelings I handle with care
Some niggas recognize the light but they can't handle the glare
You know I ain't the type to walk around with matching shirts
If relationship is effort I will match your work
I wanna be the one to make you happiest, and hurt you the most
They say the end is near, it's important that we close
To the most, high
Regardless of what happen on him let's rely

There are times, when you'll need someone
I will be by your side
There is a light, that shines
Special for you, and me

Yo, yo, check it
It's important, we communicate
And tune the fate of this union, to the right pitch
I never call you my bitch or even my boo
There's so much in a name and so much more in you
Few understand the union of woman and man
And sex and a tingle is where they assume that it land
But that's fly by night for you and the sky I write
For in these cold Chi night's moon, you my light
If heaven had a height, you would be that tall
Ghetto to coffee shop, through you I see that all
Let's stick to understanding and we won't fall
For better or worse times, I hope to me you call
So I pray everyday more than anything
Friends will stay as we begin to lay
This foundation for a family, love ain't simple
Why can't it be anything worth having you work at annually
Granted we known each other for some time
It don't take a whole day to recognize sunshine

There are times, when you'll need someone
I will be by your side
There is a light, that shines
Special for you, and me

Yeah, yo, yo, check it
It's kinda fresh you listen to more than hip-hop
And I can catch you in the mix from beauty to thrift shop
Plus you ship hop when it's time to, thinking you fresh
Suggesting beats I should rhyme to
At times when I'm lost I try to find you
You know to give me space when it's time to
My heart's dictionary defines you, as love and happiness
Truthfully it's hard trying to practice abstinence
The time we committed love it was real good
Had to be for me to arrive and it still feel good
I know the sex ain't goin' keep you, but as my equal
It's how I must treat you
As my reflection in light I'ma lead you
And whatever's right, I'ma feed you
Ticka tah, ticka tah, ticka ticka tickah
Yo I tell you the rest when I see you, peace

There are times, when you'll need someone
I will be by your side
There is a light, that shines
Special for you, and me

(I'll) take my chances, before they pass
Pass me by, oh darling,
You need to look at the other side
You'll agree",The Light,2006

The pain still has me sinking
All while the heart gently weeps
Your smell has got me shrinking

Because the heart gently weeps

Snowy night, fiends basing
A Raisin in the Sun was amazing
The joint on the dresser, a gauge went off
Jumped up, fish tank, it fell and they stuck
They shot her cousin LaVon, he owed a buck
Willie was awful, pulled out the ratchet, let off two
Grits fell on his leg, Kiana ripped the cold bowl
He violent, an Island nigga with the talent
Of six killas who just came home, from straight wilding
Robbing everything in Macy's, Lacy, short haircut
With long arms, who fuck niggas, got four babies
Yvette jabber her, slapped her wig off, ran in the crib
She did the dumb shit, my nigga then clapped her
Lester, smoked Chester sister, Vest, I heard it was a mess
They ripped the apple out her throat, blessed her
Hungry hyenas from Medina, all eight trained us
Who got reluct', think fast, and blast from Beamers

[Ghostface Killah]
I brought my bitch out to Pathmark, she's pushing the cart
Headed to aisle four, damn I got milk on my Clark's
That's what I get, not focusing, from hitting that bar
My mouth dried, need plenty water quick, I feel like a shark
In the aisle, busting them paper towels and wiping my Wally's down

I stood up to face a barrel, he's holding a shiny pound
It's him, he want revenge, I murdered his Uncle Tim
I sold him a bag of dope, his wife came and copped again
That bitch is crazy and uh, she brought her baby
She knew I hard the murders, a smack, it killed her man though
Now I got his fucking nephew gripping his gat, you'se a bitch...
You better kill me... you know you're booty...
You pulled your toolie out on me... motherfucker!
First thought was to snatch the ratchet, said fuck it and fucking grabbed it
I ducked, he bucked twice, this nigga was fucking laughing
I wrestled him to the ground, tustle, scuffle, constantly kicked him
He wouldn't let go the joint so I fucking bit him
Shots was whizzing, hitting Clorox bottles
Customers screaming, then the faggot ran out of hollows
I had to show him what it's all about
Next thing you read in the paper ""A man who came to kill, gets knocked out""

[Chorus: Erykah Badu]
I don't know whhhhhhhhhhhy... nobody told you
Man's not supposed to cry...
Though we're just babies... and you're so crazy
How tears of joy, bring so much life

[Method Man]
Yo aiyo yo yo yo
You on ya way to the store, nigga, grab me a Dutch
I'm mad as fuck, my dude, my count was short when I was bagging it up
Now I need liquor, nigga pass me a cup
What's up with Officer Brown? The other day he tried to shackle me up
He killed Kase and now he hassling us
This motherfucker got balls, even the gaul to try and patten me up
Time to re-up, let these niggaz know we back on the block
With three hundred off a G-pack, it's cracking the spot

Please trust me it wasn't easy for Diamond, it scarred her deeply
Plays like a Fender bass
To myself thought how much does gender play?
Rememberin such hatred at this tender age
If I could send a mental page
My thoughts would end the rage
Reminiscin of the looks to her in class I gave, my eyes would say

Hold on, I'm sure, that there's so much more to live for
If you hold on, things'll change
So come on, be strong
And hold on, I'm sure, there's so much more to live for
As you grow strong, things'll change
No pain (no more pain), no gain (no more pain)

Please be willin to fight for your will despite writings from William Lynch
Millions tried to rise like helium, but died in the fields and the trenches
Cries from the killing is senseless
Eyes to the ceiling, it quenches a thirst and a feeling that's endless
The prize like a rain that wrenches the soul and cleanses your mind from white picketed fences
Heads up your ass, splinters in face, mentally ridin benches
The masters, pastors, disastrous but fascist bastards
They crafted this hazardous plan, that still has us broken and battered
We shoulder the struggle
With the weight of a boulder that muffles the sound of provocative thinking, the pieces of puzzles
Incompleted, only deleted
To be pushed to the back of your mind like a hairline that has receded
Now we repeated, the process, but never weeded the problem out
Heeded the warnings but never proceeded to solve it
No forward progress, it's obvious the soul is gone
I meditate and pray that these words will somehow allow you to

Reminiscin' of the looks to her in class I gave, my eyes would say

See now Diamond is priceless
Timeless, how she maneuvers like Heimlich
In this new world it remind me of Isis
She knows now that her complexion is a holy device
A protection from UV rays in this negative time of crisis
Like a knife through butter slices
Easily to anger she reacts pious
Like a cell protectin itself from a virus
Twice is strong is her demeanor, now she is righteous
God is what you see now when you peer inside her eyelids

You do? 
Um hmm
You know when those kids tease you?
Uh huh
Don't you ever worry about that because you're very beautiful. 
Do you know you're beautiful?
Um hmm
Are you ready?
Ma I love you.
I love you

He pushed her down and called her black and ugly
She asked why must you tease me,
He laughed at her said your from Africa
Your hair is peasey 
Your skin is dark and greasy 
And plus you are so beneath me 
Please trust me it wasn't easy
For diamond it scarred her deeply 
Plays like a offender bass
To my self I thought how much does gender play
Remembering such hatred at this tender age 
If I could send a mental page
My thoughts would end the rage
Reminiscent of the looks to her in class 
I gave my eyes would say

[Chorus]
Hold on, I'm sure
There's so much more, to live for
If you hold on, things'll change 
So c'mon be strong 
And hold on, I'm sure 
There's so much more, to live for
As you grow strong things'll change
No pain, no gain

Please be willing to fight for your will despite 
Writings from William lynch
Millions tried to rise like helium
But died in the fields and the trenches
Cries from the killing is senseless
Eyes to the ceiling it quenches 
A thirst in the feeling that's endless 
The prize like a rain that rinses
The soul and cleanses ya mind 
From white picketed fences 
Heads up your ass, splinters and face
Meant to they ride and bench us
The masters pastured disaster 
Them fascious bastards 
They crafted this hazardous plan and still has a spoken advantage
We shoulder the struggle 
With the wieght of a boulder that muffles 
The sound of provocative thinking the pieces of puzzles
Incompleted,
Only deleted to be push to the back of ya mind 
Like a hairline that has receded 
Now we repeated, 
The process but never weeded the problem out
Heeded the warnings but never proceeded to solve it
No forward progress, its obvious the soul is gone, 
I meditate and pray that these words will somehow allow you to

[Chorus]

See now diamond is priceless, 
Timeless how she maneuvers like Heimlich
In this new world it reminds me of isis
She knows now that her complexion is a holy device
A protection from U-V rays in this negative time of crisis 
Like a knife that butter slices 
Easily to anger she reacts pious 
Like a cell protectin' itself from a virus
Twice as strong as her demeanor 
Now she is Righteous
God is what you see now 
When you peer inside her iris 

[Chorus]

Diamond your so beautiful 
You can change this world 
If you want to girl oh 
Ooh
Come on 
Grow strong",Hold On,2007

It's a lot you can find in the lost black girl

My third eye is my rail, on this Illa-thought 
With afrocentric stamps I'm mailin thoughts 
To my Gods held in court 
I dwell where rebellion's taught, and emotions seldom walk 
I try to Walk Like an Egyptian, with Hieroglyphics spelled in chalk 
I guess the hustlin is the unspoken Gospel 
Love that I'm an apostle, feel the holy spirit of Chicago

Had me checkin myself and double checkin, I popped the +Resurrection+ 
In the mirror I only heard my reflection 
Let me hold mics, while you hold dicks and CD collections 
And at MusicLand and Coop's, we can make connections 
I meditate with confidence, to not chomp on cents 
Outspoken like 30's but yet I guard my lips 
Writin niggaz with stripes, I hold posture with

And there's a, and there's a fine, line 
Too late to pray that I'm on it

There's a fine line between love and hate you see 
Came way too late  but baby I'm on it,
And there's a fine line between love and hate you see 
Can't wait too late  but baby I'm on it. 
Can't worry bout, what a nigga think now see 
That's Liberation and baby I want it,
Can't worry bout, what another nigga think 
Now that's Liberation and baby I want it

(Let me hear it, let me hear it, let me hear those, let me hear those) 
Many times I sit back and contemplate 
I'm fresh off the dank, but I'm telling my story,
My relationship, with my folks is give and take 
And I done took so much, now gimme my glory 
To have a choice to be who you wants to be 
It's left up to me, and my momma and 'em told me (yes she did) 
I say to have a choice to be who you wants to be 
Is left up to me, and my momma nem told me 

No, no, no
I'm so tired, it's been so long, struggling, hopelessly 
Seven and forty days, hey
Oh, I sacrifice every breath I breathe 
To make you believe, I'd give my life away
Oh lord, I'm so tired, I'm so tired 
My feet feel like I walked most of the road on my own 
All on my own, we,
We alive but we ain't living, that's why I'm giving until it's gone 
Cause I don't want to be alone (I don't want to be alone) 
I don't want to be alone, yeah
Is there anything I can say to help you find your way 
Touch ya soul, make ya whole, the same for you and I 
There's not a minute that goes by that I don't believe 
We can fly.. but I can feel it in the wind 
The beginning or the end 
So people keep your head to the sky

Shake that load off, shake that load off [Repeat: x16]

Folk in your face, you're a superstar 
Niggas hang around cause of who you are 
You get a lot of love cause of what you got 
Say they happy for you but they really not 
Sell a lot a' records and you roll a Benz 
Fall up in the spot now you losing friends 
All ya want to do is give the world ya heart 
Record label trying to make you compromise ya art 
You make a million dollars, make a million mo' 
First class broads treat ya like a nigga po 
You want to say ""Wait!"" but you're scared to ask 
Ya world starts spinning and it's moving fast 
Ya try to stay sane that's the price of fame 
Spending your life trying to numb the pain 
Ya shake that load off and sing ya song 
Liberate the minds, then you go on home...

I must admit, they planted a lot of things 
In the brains and the veins of my strain 
Makes it hard to refrain, from the host of cocaine 
From them whores, from the flame 
From a post in the game 
Makes it hard to maintain focus 
Then from the glock rounds and lockdowns and burials 
The seeds that sow, get devoured by the same locusts 
Cause it's a hard row to hoe 
If your ass don't move, and the rain don't fall 
And the ground is dry 
But the roots are strong, so some survive 
To your surprise, no one voived their cries 
You got more juice than Zeus 
Slanging lightning trying to frighten 
Plains dwellers, of the Serengeti 
But get beheaded when you falsely dreaded 
Melanin silicon and collagen injected 
Dissecting my pride, fool I don't want to get it started 
We be the lionhearted, without a fantasy 
It's like that red sprite, you can't imagine it 
Unless you looking at the canvas of life 
And not through the peephole of mortality 
Single minded mentality 
Getting over on loopholes 
Getting paid two-fold on technicalities 
Clicking your heels, scared to bust how you feel 
Pack the steel 
Picking cotton from the killing fields with no Toto 
I don't we in Kansas no mo' though 
Midwest or Dirty South 
Clean dressed or dirty mouth 
Whether robbing preachers or killing Poor Righteous Teachers 
You a scared demon 
Shouldn't be allowed to spread semen 
And your cowardly lies never defying the jackals of babble 
Running with they pack, tail between your legs 
Though the man on your head say the story 
As you downplay your glory 
Cackling, helping the shackling of your brethren happen 
Just by rapping

I chose me

Had two babies different dudes
And for them both my love was true
This is my last interview, oh
Hey there's me, ooh
This year I turned thirty six
Damn it seems it came so quick
My ass and legs have gotten thick yea
It's all me
I use to pray to God above
But now I'm filled with so much love
But even if the world can't see
It's still me
Will I escape this vanity?
Or will I keep on smoking trees?
But I'll just let it go and be, be, be Me

Ah, leave it alone babe
Well well well
Ah oh, leave it alone babe
Just being me
Ah, leave it alone babe
Well well well
Ah oh, leave it alone babe
Just being me

Sometimes I don't know what to say
So many leaders to obey
But I was born on saviors day, yes
So I chose me
And in this world of greed and hate
They may try to erase my face
But millions spring up in my place
Ooh, believe in me
As sure is all and all is one
We all should grow before it's done
So I salute you Farrakan, yes
'Cause you are me
Before I end this crazy dream
Before I take one for the team
Yo ass done matched the gasoline, yes

Eating veggies when serve sex the medium
And if we break up
Imam eat meat again
I feel complete with you
Shit, I held up size up the street for you
In the street people ask about me and you
I tell them we go through what most people do
Yes, let go of fear love
We can grow as long as my beard does
You push me way in the way you supposed to

What's up with them hater dudes?
Ma' hating is OK with you?
Why, cause they drive in them fancy cars

Doo doo doo, diggy-doo yo

I never knew a luh, luh luh, a love like this
Gotta be somethin' for me to write this
Queen, I ain't seen you in a minute
Wrote this letter and finally decide to send it

Signed, sealed, delivered for us to grow together
Love has no limit, let's spend it slow forever
I know your heart is weathered by what studs did to you
I ain't gon' assault 'em 'cause I probably did it too

Because of you feelings I handle with care
Some niggaz recognize the light but they can't handle the glare
You know I ain't the type to walk around with matchin' shirts
If relationship is effort I will match your work

I wanna be the one to make you happiest, it hurts you the most
They say the end is near, it's important that we close
To the most, high
Regardless of what happen on him let's rely

There are times when you'll need someone
I will be by your side
There is a light that shines
Special for you and me
Yo, yo, check it

It's important we communicate
And tune the fate of this union to the right pitch
I never call you my bitch or even my boo
There's so much in a name and so much more in you

Few understand the union of woman and man
And sex and a tingle is where they assume that it land
But that's fly by night for you and the sky I write
For in these cold star night's moon, you my light

If heaven had a height, you would be that tall
Ghetto to coffee shop, through you I see that all
Let's stick to understandin' and we won't fall
For better or worse times, I hope to me you call

So I pray everyday more than anything friends will stay as we begin to lay
This foundation for a family love ain't simple
Why can't it be anything worth having you work at annually?
Granted we known each other for some time
It don't take a whole day to recognize sunshine

There are times when you'll need someone
I will be by your side, oh darling
There is a light that shines
Special for you and me
Yeah, yo, yo, check it

It's kinda fresh you listen to more than hip-hop
And I can catch you in the mix from beauty to thrift shop
Plus you ship hop when it's time to, thinkin' you fresh
Suggestin' beats I should rhyme to

At times when I'm lost I try to find you
You know to give me space when it's time to
My heart's dictionary defines you, it's love and happiness
Truthfully it's hard tryin' to practice abstinence

The time we committed love it was real good
Had to be for me to arrive and it still feel good
I know the sex ain't gon' keep you, but as my equal
It's how I must treat you

As my reflection in light I'm a lead you
And whatever's right, I'm a feed you
Digga da, digga da, digga da, digga digga da da
Yo I tell you the rest when I see you, peace

There are times when you'll need someone
I will be by your side
There is a light, that shines
Special for you and me
I'll take my chances before they pass, pass, pass
Pass me by, oh darling

Maybach triple white like I'm riding in a cloud
No denim on my seats, baby you gon' need a towel
Ride sexy through the city, see me you will be aroused
My bankroll so well endowed, 
Pull bitches from M-I-A to A-T-L in style
And in crowds catch me in town, on the strip in Vegas
Chilling, filling bitches faces with babies
Bitch bite your tongue, this just ain't a Mercedes
Tell the A.T.F. I'm riding with another 3-80
That's my car cost, y'all thought I would fall off
That was just a small loss, we can have a ball off
Fly to N.Y., meet me at the Waldorf
Historian architecture Victorian
Riding in the past like you're driving a DeLorean
Hard times, never heard of those in the 'Bach
My feet kicked up, get my dick sucked with the curtains closed
And for the record kid, my final question is
How your bitch gon' feel in that 
When you two pull up next to this?
Ha ha ha ha, Maybach Music nigga!

[Chorus]
Everybody knows, how the story goes
Money and the clothes, they gon' come and go
But guess who stays the same? You gon' see my name
Stroll real slow, with the curtains low

Yo, piff that I'm blowing on is fucking up the ozone
Plus I keep a dope line similar to Cold Stone's
Ice cream, pipe dreams
Is what they have when I pull up in that light thing
I put a hurting on, I got the curtains drawn
Whoever ain't getting shitted on, I'm squirting on
I'm in the six-deuce, fifty-sevens for the health
Chopper in the trunk, .45 for the belt
Bunch of wax dummies, all you guys gonna melt
Live for your kids, die for yourself
Bottles in the sky if you ride for the wealth
Peas on the block, pies on the shelf
If I ain't in the back of the 'Bach, I ain't in nothing else
Haha, I'm something else

Everybody knows how the story goes
Money and the clothes, they gon' come and go
But guess who stays the same?

Uh (justice league) 
Cigar please
I came alive like a moth in the summer time
Japanese wheel blades all samurai
Shine brighter than them bitches on the other side
Time to make a blind motherfucker recognize
Ammunition got the competition nonexistent
Had to bubble crack but didn't have a pot to piss it
I'll double that, how dare you try to knock a nigga?
Street scholar, graduated no father figure
Still tote chrome, check my chromosomes
Meet me halfway with things and a mobile home
Money machines, yeah they ring like a mobile phone
I'm a seven-up, I need a coca-cola loan
I'm in the hood like I'm James Evans
Cashmere hand-made sweater
Me and money got a vendetta

We'll fight it out to see it through

We could stay at home and

Maybe we could last an hour

I can't believe all of the things they say about me
Walk in the room they throwing shade left to right
They be like, ""Ooh, she serving face""
And I just tell 'em cut me up and get down
They call us dirty 'cause we break all your rules down
And we just came to act a fool, is that alright?
(Girl, that's alright)
They be like, ""Ooh, let them eat cake.""
But we eat wings and throw them bones on the ground

Am I a freak for dancing around?
Am I a freak for getting down?
I'm coming up, don't cut me down
Yeah I wanna be, wanna be

Is it peculiar that she twerk in the mirror?
And am I weird to dance alone late at night?
And is it true we're all insane?
And I just tell 'em, ""No we ain't"" and get down

I heard this life is just a play with no rehearsal
I wonder will this be my final act tonight
And tell me what's the price of fame?
Am I a sinner with my skirt on the ground?

Am I a freak for dancing around?
Am I a freak for getting down?
I'm coming up, don't cut me down
Yeah I wanna be, wanna be

Hey brother can you save my soul from the devil?
Say is it weird to like the way she wear her tights?
And is it rude to wear my shades?
Am I a freak because I love watching Mary? (Maybe)

Hey sister am I good enough for your heaven?
Say will your God accept me in my black and white?
Will he approve the way I'm made?

Because the booty don't lie

No, no, the booty don't lie
Oh no, the booty don't lie

Yeah
Yeah, let's flip it
I don't think they understand what I'm trying to say

I asked a question like this
""Are we a lost generation of our people?
Add us to equations but they'll never make us equal.

So why ain't the stealing of my rights made illegal?
They keep us underground working hard for the greedy,
But when it's time pay they turn around and call us needy.

Gimme back my pyramid, I'm trying to free Kansas City.

Mixing masterminds like your name Bernie Grundman.
Well I'm gonna keep leading like a young Harriet Tubman
You can take my wings but I'm still goin' fly
And even when you edit me the booty don't lie
Yeah, keep singing and I'mma keep writing songs
I'm tired of Marvin asking me, ""What's Going On?
March to the streets 'cause I'm willing and I'm able
Categorize me, I defy every label

Erykah Badu,"I was born in a human body, I’m deadly and dangerous
The way I decrease life quality is outrageous
But you don’t gotta worry, I’m not contagious
I’m genetic, I travel through your family for ages
I could live in yo daughter, I could live in yo son
If you smoke cigarettes, I could live in yo lungs
I can develop in yo stomach and be that small
But I grow to the size of a basketball
Now you can ignore me and try to pass it on
You’ll be a statistic, in the casket gone
I could be a sharp pain that you feel in yo spine
I can be a brain tumor on the back of yo mind
I’ll even be in yo food if you eatin that swine
Don’t go to the doctor so you never catch me in time
I done cause some strong men to lose they strength
Even cause some pretty women to lose they breasts
Only God know the cure and to whom he bless
Is the chosen, he choose the best
I’m a physical enemy, here to bring miserable treachery
I can affect him, her, they, you or them and me
But one small woman gotta checkup randomly
They burn me out of her body with chemotherapy
If you come late I’ll deflate your energy
Take all of your hair and erase your memory
I can shorten your life if you livin it long
Even took a black queen named Vivian Strong
If you don’t go to the doctor that mean you support me
The only way to stop me is to catch me early
And gangstas who think I can’t get in y'all body
I even claimed the life of mobster John Gotti
Have you had a checkup? If no is your answer
Then let me introduce myself, my name is cancer

He rides to it
Don’t stress a lot
Put protection on
If he’s in your home

The prettiest woman out here blows long in the wind
Even sip when she wasn’t soft as her skin
Teeth look like ivory, pleasant as a beach
Breasts like 2 watermelons, ripe like a peach
On the outside, sexy as can be
But on the inside she’s infected with me
She be up in every neighborhood, dead on the street
Give you her phone number, give you head in the V
And she don’t like condom, she sex it for free
So if you ever met er get tested for me
Every single day I add names to my dying list
My epidemic is strong as an iron fist
You should check your body fluids, that’s where I exist
Can travel through saliva, I hope you like to kiss
You can’t get rid of me, you can cry and wish
It’s no denying this, science says
He says I was born in Africa, but he’s a lying bitch
I was born in the laboratory, my father’s a scientist
You can’t contact me if you walk in a bathroom
Or if you talk to your classmate in your classroom
You never see me coming, I’m smooth as a jazz tune
Not airborne, I pass moves
But you should make sure they clean the needle when you getting them tattoos
I’m the reason the word positive means bad news
Idiotic if you don’t believe in me
Even took a great rapper named Eazy-E
If you have a lot of sex you should have some condoms
Cause you could live with me, ask Magic Johnson
I enter your body with only one assumed mission
That’s only to break down your immune system
Become sick easy cuz you not immune
And I can pass over through every open wound
So make sure you put a Band-Aid on your cut
Before you shake another man’s hands sayin wussup
I’m physical and visible, you can’t feel me
Medicine, I’m invincible, you can’t kill me
AIDS is my name, don’t get it wrong
It stands for Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome
(Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome
Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome)

This drug addict named Raj is infected with my evil
Got some new dope he wanna try with his people
He said go ahead and try it, it’s some brand new diesel
That’s when I found myself travelling through a needle
Don’t even know what he getting into is a shame
Tied his arm up and pump me right in his vein
He had a lot of women, was living to play his life
But he was married, he took me home to his wife
Now she’s a carrier who carries on with me
His wife had a baby, the baby was born with me
And I hope that you wouldn’t take this song silly
A lot of people infected, it’s a strong pity
You got a jimmy hat? Then you should put on jimmy
Let’s protect ourselves, we should all, really
I’m tryna live long, won’t you live long with me?

sudden dying population of bees is related to cell phones
The bees sync cell phone signals transmitted when the phones ring
Causing them to emit heavy buzzing noises
This frequency confuses the bees, making them fly erratically
Bees use the earth's magnetic field as a compass

Making it impossible for them hoes to find their way back to the hive

Freestylin' to them Chronic instrumentals
No pens and pencils, I was out there Bloodin' like a menstrual
With a Backwood clinched between my dentals
Way back when, when we was outside with the indo
Hotboxin' rentals in front of Centennial
Remedial thoughts, never thought that I would amount to shit
Smoke chronic, fuck bitches, ride around bouncin' shit
From Impalas to that Harley truck
To dishraggin' bitches that was hard to fuck
I came up, it was hardly luck
Just left Compton, and I ain't have to use my AK
What a day, what a day

Back when my drivers license, was baby faced and triflin'
I made my way through crisis
I made my tape and recorded portraits in front of sirens
I made you hate the vibrant, you can't escape the tyrant
You can't relate where I've been
In '98 my problem, actin' too grown and shit
Cappin' at bitches, yeah my religion through songs and shit
On me, that's on me
Raise up, nigga, you are not the homie
Bitch I’m well-connected from my section down to Long Beach
Fumblin' with Tetris if your block neglectin' your ki
Everyday I wake up with my face up to my father
Makin' sure my heart is pure enough to grow my seed  and harvest
All my king stuffin', double up my plantation with dollar
Every dream is such reality, my deja vu done caught up
Bitch I'm brought up with the homies, that's on me
24/7, Kendrick reppin' these cold streets
Don't we live by it, die by it, then reincarnate
And if Game told me, ""Drive by it,"" I raise AK
Ain't no shame on it, cry about it, fuck that, I'll play
Like no name on it, blindsided, ain't no one safe
Documentary had identities of where I'm from
Therefore my energy had to make sure the better me won
It ain't no better one, son, it ain't no tellin' me nothin'
Nigga it's Chuck, Doc Dre and K, the legacy's done

Oh man, you thought these niggas with attitude would show gratitude
Fooled you
From 2015 to infinity it's still bomb weed and Hennessy
I can pimp a butterfly for the energy
Game I need acapella

There I go, give me a minute, nigga
'Bout to hit a home run, K. Dot, grab the pennant, nigga
Pin it on my Pendleton, trap late night, Jay Leno them
Got my mom a tennis bracelet, Wimbledon of Wilmington
Now can I rap for a minute? Black on the track for a minute
Look in my rhyme book, see murder like when I was a fan of No Limit
Ain't no gimmicks 'round here, this Compton, me, Doc and Kendrick
Chronic, good kid, my first year, 3 documentaries
Now I'm blockin' sentries, 16 Impalas
They bounce like they need a dollar

Spoonfeed you niggas like toddlers, from the city of Impalas
When shot callers take their pitbulls and feed them niggas rottweilers

Esau,"[ VERSE 1: Esau ]
On the first seven days the Gods created the Heaven and the Earth
But the second chapter of Genesis is contradictory to the first
They created the watery Heaven and Earth, the night and day
They separated Heaven and Earth, created land, then vegetation
After that they created the sun, moon, stars, seas and fish and birds, then animals
And to top it all off let us make man in our image, after our likeness
And let him have dominion over everything that creeps on the Earth
As a ruler he was first
When they were finished they picked a spokesman:
I have given you every plant yielding seed
In every tree put seed in its fruit
You shall have them for food
They didn't say anything about hamburger, hot dogs, lamb chops
Bacon, cheese????, hamhocks, chicken peel or barbeque
Now in the second chapter the Gods made Heaven, then Earth
Then man, then vegetation, a straight contradiction of the first
Yet he was placed in the Garden Even where the first limitation was set
No eating from the tree of knowledge, disobedience means death
Feeling man was lonely they brought forth ????, animals and birds
But this didn't satisfy him for he was the first
So from his rib, so the story goes, the Gods brought forth a companion for man
Called her woman, as a couple they were first
Now the serpent knowin truth about the tree
Coaxed the first sin to be committed by Eve
Who in turn coaxed Adam to cover they know the deed
When the Gods seen this they were very displeased
With no execution committed 
The first contradiction and the first eviction by sendin the couple east
Now the first couple became the first parents of the first son
Who became the first murderer and the first refugee
Which creates the first question by man
The first person had a part in this first dysfunctional family
Was Mrs. Kane the first daughter of the first person I discussed in the Testament
And who were the people who would hold Kane and Abel for the first dismemeberment
Didn't it seem odd that God had to mark him for safety
And why were there people in the land of ??Nile??
If they weren't put there by the Gods

[ CHORUS: The Insidious One ]
From the first to the last days
From the first man to the last man
From the first birth to the first sin
To the first book a lie was written in
To the last page ????

[ VERSE 2: Esau ]
After decidin the first stage of their experiment was out of order
The Gods felt apt to commit the first mass murder
But first they needed someone they could trust to ensure their experiment would survive 
And so the first mortal to become the God's first lieutenant was chosen named Noah he was
On the first day of the first month of his 601st year
The first ship builder and the first zoo keeper
Solid ground was drowned on February 27th
The emerge of the first cruise ship, with the first ordering
They committed the first extinction by makin the Gods their first offering
After first promising Noah this wouldn't happen again
The Gods put the first rainbow in the sky as their symbol of their word of men
They allow meat to be eaten for the first time 
And Noah became the first known to ???? the soil, the first person to make em drink wine
The world spoke one language, it was the first and only time it was truly united
But the Gods weren't excited
Behold, they are one people, they have one language 
This is only the beginning of what they will do
We must swing down, scatter and disunite, confuse their crew
In the land of ???? there was the first great culture with the first ????
They were undertaking a great project in a city and a tower that was magnificient
The city was called Bable or Babylon in English
Because it was here that the Gods' plan came to get a little disrupted and shit
Now the first person instructed to head to Kanaan was a man named Abraham
First mentioned in the Bible as the man Abram
He and his nephew Lot split to Kanaan
When Lot ???? Sodom ???? Gomorrha in the valley of the Jordan
Sodom was chosen to be destoyed by the Gods because of its wicked ways
This is the first time in the Bible we have a mention of gays
But Lot lived there so Abraham intervened unsuccessfully
So Lot, his wife and his two daughters all had to flee
As they escaped Sodom Lot lost his wife and his daughters lost their men 
Becoming lonely and desperate they committed a unthinkable sin
The daughters got their father drunk, laid down with him one by one
And nine months later they both bore their own father's son
Now Abraham married to his half sister had no sons, at least not until he was 101
Then Sarah, half-sister wife bore him a child, a miracle from the Gods
But they had a test for him to prove his obedience, now this is the part that gets wild
They instructed Abraham to make the first human sacrifice
With his only son Isaac but in reality it's just the first with his wife
Sarah's servant Hagar had bore Abraham a son Ismael
The first adulterous affair mentioned in this twisted holy tale

[ CHORUS ]

[ VERSE 3: Esau ]
Now I have taken you through the first half of the first chapter
Of the first holy book and for the first time you see a lot fo the firsts in history
It's up to you and your self-education and your self-discovery
And your self-spirituality to decide the integrity
Of this holy book and others like it
And people around you and the people who preach to you and others about it
Make decisions for yourself don't have them inflicted
By the morals and the values of the secretively wicked
Discover the self truth about yourself, don't have your friends and parents pick it
You'll soon discover that atheists are wrong, preachers and ministers too
Everybody picked certain parts of everything to mold in their truth
Live your life on the Earth based on your morals and your own personal word
Before anyone can judge you you have to judge yourself first
I don't need to come off anti-Christian, anti-religious, I know I'm not the worst
People die everyday because of words and Bible verse
Think about what's forced in your mind by people who censor words
Before anyone can understand you you have to understand yourself first",First,2000

Battling with your minds retorts

Where deserts so calm

Drum beat died
Cymbal crash down

Your boots are sinking
Sink with the memories
Of long lost thinking

Lost in the blackness

My gun is my own

Esben and the Witch,"You and I have become entwined
Where the calcium meets the currents at the shoreline
I watch you lace the light across the lines
As you die oil pours from the sky
Engine breaks, engine blows, flicker and fade
I stop, look to the skies with an open mouth
The darkness fills my lungs

This place is a wasteland, your wings are mine
The lights move through the ether
Bellow machines, climb mountains, swim in streams of tar

I will hunt the one that burns out the beacon
There's nothing else for us to do here
But cut the sun from its mooring
We will cut the sun from its moorings

Esben and the Witch,"The swans begin to bellow,
Bellies full of pearls,
Screaming down the houses,
Whilst the willows start to fool.

Bow their boughs and buckle,
The curtains they are drawn,
The cavalcade and symmetry,
Commands for those to move.

The mutiny procession,
Somber and serene,
A pageant on behalf to show,
Her majesty's esteem.

The lake is turning darker,
It's as black as ostrich plumes,
Though I paraded answers,
With a noble magnitude.

Nail down the mirrors,
Pour the wars in the rooms,
The hands of the grandfathers,
Have settled on high noon.

Here the come the ire",Swans,2011

Amid fantasies of strangers, I'm indulging myself.

This fractious fever is fervent 
With feelings of extinction. 
This violence is silenced by consequence.

Bloodshot and blooming, sanguinary and ruby. 
A muted dreaming. 
A clandestine paradise ? paradise

Keep these secrets in my skin

I need my love to be here

Here, making each day of the year
Changing my life with a wave of her hand

There, running my hands through her hair
Both of us thinking how good it can be
Someone is speaking, but she doesn't know he's there

I want her everywhere
And if she's beside me I know I need never care

All the prejudice and all the hate

Life is bound to be a bore
If there's nothing left worth fighting for

The young await their present fate
Violence show what we can't say I've been around
And I don't like what I found
Staying high above the real
With chemicals, but they conceal you from the core
And you're lost forever more

Remind yourself when you are sad
All you love is all you'll ever have
Keep your brother like it's you
And repell the fake until they're true

Anyone could be your friend
Trust and they will trust you back again
Watch the stars and understand
The Creator's got a masterplan

The young await their present fate
Violence show what we can't say I've been around
And I don't like what I found
Staying high above the real
With chemicals, but they conceal you from the core

Keep your brother like it's you

To open up my heart to all that jealousy
That bitterness, that ridicule

And all the lights are changing red to green
Moving through the crowds I'm pushing
Chemicals are rushing in my bloodstream

Only wish that you were here
You know I'm seeing it so clear
I've been afraid
To show you how I really feel
Admit to some of those bad mistakes I've made

And if you want it
Come and get it
Crying out loud

Giving you was

Sky is fading red to blue
Kicking through the autumn leaves
And wondering where it is you might be going to

Turning back for home

I can't believe
Climbing on the stair
I turn around to see you smiling there
In front of me

Deny Your Ideals
Bury the Earth
Let's take every nation
Systems struggle
Borders fall
Shake the foundation

Coming together
Falling apart
To share is to split
To share is to split
Come on, let us split

Both halves are developing well
My wounds are remainders
Painful as hell
Either one face each on one side
Like a wall in the heart

Esch,"When you peel back my eyes,
I see the pain and feel alive.
My hatred heaps upon this fire,
That burns inside and you blow higher.

But I don't need to you anymore.
You cannot hurt me anymore.
Keep it away from the fire unless you want it to burn.
It burns, wildfire.

Give it to me!
Your wildfire, don't take it from me!
Wildfire, give it!
And when you take me in your mind,

Into this dirty sodden shrine.
I do not need you anymore.
You cannot hurt me anymore.
Keep it away from the fire unless you want it to burn.

It burns, wildfire.
Give it to me!
Your wildfire, don't take it from me!
Wildfire, give it to me!

Set on fire, don't take it from me!

Escola De Samba,"Nestes verso tão singelo
Minha bela, meu amor
Pra você quero contar
O meu sofre e a minha dor
Eu sou que nem sabiá
Quando canta é só tristeza
Desde o gaio onde ele está

Nesta viola eu canto e gemo de verdade
Cada toada representa uma saudade

Eu nasci naquela serra
Num ranchinho beira chão
Tudo cheio de buraco
Donde a lua fai clarão
Quando chega a madrugada
Lá no mato a passarada
Principia um baruião

Nesta viola eu canto e gemo de verdade
Cada toada representa uma saudade

Vou parar com a minha viola já não posso mai cantar,
Pois o jeca quando canta tem vontade de chorar
O choro que vai caindo
Devagá se sumindo, como as água vão pro mar",Tristeza do Jeca,
Escola De Samba,"Cada vez que me alembro
Do amigo Chico Mineiro
Das viage que nois fazia
Era ele meu companheiro

Sinto uma tristeza
Uma vontade de chorar
Alembrando daqueles tempos
Que não mais há de voltar

Apesar de eu ser patrão
Eu tinha no coração
O amigo Chico Mineiro
Caboclo bom decidido
Na viola era dolorido e era o peão dos boiadeiro

Hoje porém com tristeza
Recordando das proeza
Da nossa viage motin

Viajemo mais de dez anos
Vendendo boiada e comprando
Por esse rincão sem fim

Caboclo de nada temia
Mas porém, chegou um dia
Que Chico apartou-se de mim

Fizemos a última viagem
Foi lá pro sertão de Goiás
Fui eu e o Chico Mineiro
Também foi o capataz

Viajamos muitos dias
Pra chegar em Ouro Fino
Aonde nós passemo a noite
Numa festa do Divino

A festa tava tão boa
Mas antes não tivesse ido
O Chico foi baleado
Por um homem desconhecido

Larguei de comprar boiada
Mataram meu companheiro
Acabou-se o som da viola
Acabou-se o Chico Mineiro

Despois daquela tragédia
Fiquei mais aborrecido
Não sabia da nossa amizade
Porque nois dois era unido

Quando vi seu documento
Me cortou meu coração
Vim saber que o Chico Mineiro
Era meu legítimo irmão",Chico Mineiro,1994
Escola De Samba,"Há uma nuvem de lágrimas sobre meus olhos
Dizendo pra mim que você foi embora
E que não demora meu pranto rolar
Eu tenho feito de tudo pra me convencer
E provar que a vida é melhor sem você
Mas meu coração não se deixa enganar

Vivo inventando paixões pra fugir da saudade
Mas depois da cama a realidade
É só sua ausência doendo demais
Dá um vazio no peito, uma coisa ruim
O meu corpo querendo seu corpo em mim
Vou sobrevivendo num mundo sem paz

Ah jeito triste de ter você
Longe dos olhos e dentro do meu coração
Me ensina a te esquecer
Ou venha logo e me tire dessa solidão

Venían de ambos lados R-15 y cuerno
También granadazos
Todos bien entrados ni como rajarse

Era el desempate este era un pleito de grandes
Uno estaba coordinando
No cesen el fuego al tiro muchachos porque esto no es juego
De otro lado se escuchaba
Al frente plebada un lanza granadas para esas blindadas
Y a como le atoren les vamos a dar el doble

De pronto callo el gobierno
Todos quedaron rodeados
Esto no estaba en los planes porque juegas chueco
Tas equivocado yo no le llame a gobierno
Ya olvídate de eso y salva tu pellejo
Tu también cuida tu vida que esto no termina después lo arreglamos
No me gustan las ventajas
Y ni a mi las trampas
Pues ahi nos miramos

Luego ordena a su plebada ahí que retirarnos

Todos en caliente cubrían a los jefes
De aquellos disparos que hacían los soldados
Hubo detenidos entre ellos varios heridos

Estamos entrados ya volveré a verte
Pues yo aquí estoy puesto

Hoy tuviste suerte

(I'm the calm one, but my crew is sorta sick)
Yeah, big l is the first to represent.

Yo, on the mic is big l, that brother who kicks flavs, god.
Known for sendin' garbage mcs to the graveyard.
I pack a gat, not a slingshot;
Step to this and get an ass-whoopin' like rodney king got.
Or get beat to your death like cochise,
My laws is no peace, fuck the police.
M-C's get braggin' about cash they collect,
But them chumps is like ray Charles,
Cause they ain't seen no money yet.
Trash rappers I tax and spark,
I be wettin' niggas up like water rides at action park.
A nigga stuck me, and that ain't funny son,
So I got money gun, they wet him and his honey bun.
Cause phony faggots I froze, it's a fact,
I flip fast on foes with fabulous fantastic flows.
L is the rebel type, I'm rough as a metal pipe,
Fuck a benz, cause I could pull skins on a pedal-bike.
Props, I got the most, no mc comes close,coast-to-coast,
Shows I host, foes I roast, adios, I'm ghost

[Chorus]

Yo, street ? in new york is a place this nigga stands
With a machete I'm a crazy Eddie scissor hands.
Born with such a thirst to kill,
I can tap 200 quarters from a $50 bill.
Cuttin' bitch-niggas down with a hundred pound axe
Like I was raised by psycho-crazed lumberjacks.
So in a battle I be stabbin',choppin' M-C'ss like trees,
Piece-by-piece buildin' cabins.
I'm a maniac magician, Abra cadabra,
Makin' pain appear cause I'm-a grab arusty chain to make a noose
To choke your ass so hard, you're spittin' fuckin' adam's apple juice.
So come check the magic show by Deshawn,
And witness the way I put you to death with a magic wand.
Turnin' your home to a casket,
Turn your wife into a widow and your son into a bastard.
Cause I love to keep M-C's sufferin',
Beggin' for big, heavy bags of bufferin'.
Baseball battin' 'em, splattin' 'em,
So many homicide records, my cases went platinum.
D'shawn is nice,
Known for givin' out head cracks without touchin' dice.
Just pain and punishment from the boogie down bronxter,
D'shawn the maniac street mobster.

[Chorus]

It's the f-I-n-e-double-s-e,
Don't play or stress me
Cause that shit don't impress me
I make papes off the shit I create, and then dictate
So get your motherfuckin' shit straight
I got skills and I'm hard to kill,
So y'all bitch-ass rappes better chill and just guard your grill
You grab a mic and always get hype
Talkin' bout fuckin' niggas up
When you can bearly beat your dick right
So stop ridin' my dilznick
Cause I can still kick the ill shit on the motherfuckin' real tip
Hit like foreman when I'm brawlin'
Those who think I'm fallin, I'll play your monkey-ass like a organ
I got crazy niggas in the city noid
Got mad bitches, but it's not cause I'm a motherfuckin' pretty-boy
I'm ruthless, I'm not on that goody-goody tip
That shit played out with that beat street/electric boogie shit
I'll stomp any rapper that you ?
If they ass is weak, they better chill and grab a seat
And go 'head with they master plan
Stevie wonder probably see me 'fore half you rappers can
You can't hang and you're fallin' fast
You rappers that's trash better dash and start haulin' ass
Cause I'm out to rag shit
Fuck up a show, collect my dough
And step off with a bad bitch
Spectators always have the best time
When they come to a show and hear a funky lord finesse rhyme
I'm out to get bigger, lounge and make rich figures
You'll never catch finesse associating with bitch niggas
I work overtime when it's time to go for mine
Crab-ass rappers, don't even front cause y'all know the time
So it's time for me to step
Peace to showbiz and ag and I'm off to the left

I get a hit from my Buddha blessed.
Turn my hat to the back, now let's see who's the best.
I like my pockets fat, never ever flat.
Niggas wanna jack, my .45 ain't havin' that.
Hoes get no dough, so why try?
Think it's gonna be a hit 'n' run? wrong, it's a drive-by.
Niggas catchin' tantrums,because your girl's never safe around
The midnight phantom.
They predicted I'm-a fall,
They must be down with Michael Jackson cause that shit is off the wall.
You don't believe me, ask that brother show,
Snatchin' hotties, grabbin' hotties, lettin' mothafuckers know.
You come wrong if you don't come strong,
You better catch wreck! mothafucker, I made the song.
Styles will vary, they won't carry over.
Don't fuck with no devil, I'd rather marry Oprah.
Yeah, you got it, I'm pro-black,
And my skills are so phat, I pay my dues, I don't owe jack.
You bite my style, I can spot it.
Tryin' real hard to get it,
You can forget it, because you don't got it.
And my skills are excellent, diggin' in the crates
And it's time to represent!

ESG,"Tonight will be preceded by
A few drinks to calm me down
To settle my gut, to work up a smile
Because your bones are shakin'
Baby, agitate my nerves
I'm feeling reckless
And I feel the need to stress this
I'm stepping out
And I'll do this till I'm somebody else
Well, tonight I'll be a classic work
Like Edgar Allan Poe
And I'll die on these streets of Baltimore
As a beggar, john, or buyer
Look, I'm just trying to score
But at least I won't be out alone
I'm with my uncle and his mother
And the rest of my family's history
Is with me, shouting, ""have another""
Now I'm taking all the liberties
I was too scared to before
I've accepted that we're just chemicals
Now bend over and touch the floor
Plan A has got a boyfriend
But she melts to my touch
Plan B has got a crush
As much as she's got a lust
Plan C well, God forgive me
Well, she, she just lives to fuck
I'll just act like I'm not in control
Well I'm feeling reckless
And I feel the need to stress this
I'm stepping out
And I'll take this, drink think, do this, smoke this
fuck you while we're somebody else
But at least I won't be out alone
I'm with my uncle and his mother
And the rest of my family's history
Is with me, shouting, ""have another""
Now I'm taking all the liberties
I was too scared to before
I've accepted that we're just chemicals
Now bend over and touch the floor
Shut up and dance
Ms. sings in her sleep
Ms. moves to my beat
What kind of secrets are we keeping tonight?
Because he's not here and he's not waiting up
How about another spin around the floor?
But at least I won't be out alone
I'm with my uncle and his mother
And the rest of my family history
Is with me, shouting, ""have another""
Be sure I'm slutting it up
'Cause I know love's not enough
And I'll be outside the bar
Hopes for the back of her car
She's got wandering eyes
And much more curious lips
And I'm still betting every dime
She answers as her skirt slides over her hips",Erase You,1991

Say Slim, what's the deal baby
(making this money man) uh-huh, true that true that
Check this out, it's going down over here
On the South, so I'm bout to come over
There on the North and scoop you up
We gotta put it down, boys ain't feel us in 9-9
With that Braids N' Fades, it's Y2K baby
Know I'm tal'n bout, candy coated still putting it down
Still swanging and banging ha, boys gon feel us man
Boys gon feel us, wha-wha-wha-wha-wha-what

My love, have you ever seen a
Candy coated Exursion, swang and bang
Still gripping grain
(Northside man huh, Southside what)

[E.S.G.]
See I'm a wide body roller, wood grain remote controller
Blades on Escalades, electric shocks on Range Rovers
Man the game over, when me and Slim pull up
You see us flossing on chrome, with the styrofoam cup
I got a eight and a liter, swanging on the feeter
In the Bentley watching BET, I'm tripping off of Cita
Cristal margaritas, we some block bleeders
My balling tire size, can't ride in two-seaters
Man I need Excursion, or my Navigator
My big body Denali, sqauatting like a Florida Gator
Tell them playa haters, E.S.G. I don't bar
50 cash and dash, like my name was Peter Warren
I parallel parked it, ghetto starts cost to Mars
Man my rims cost more, than some boys cars
Hit the Boulevard, with the nine on my lap-lap
Southside on the map-map, Screw tape tap-tap

Now when I come down, I be throwing up the North shwoing off
Six gallons of gloss, on my 7-9 Boss
I floss the candy cream gleam, when I pull on the scene
My four 18's and screens, got my shit sitting mean
My drop top is a supreme, king of a young team's dream
Like a diamond it bling-bling, when it's hit with sun beams
Shoot more spiders in my ring, when I glide up the block
I got a trunk full of knock, about to bust air shocks
I'm shutting down the parking lot, when you see me ride
See me sitting high with pride, sliding on the buck hide
Looking pretty, on a tour all across my city
Sipping drank by the pint, about to bust my kidney
From the North to the South, we gon represent
I'm getting bent behind tint, pros by the air vent
I spent a lot of cash to shine, but it came in handy
Cause like a child, Slim Thug is so in love with candy huh

[E.S.G.]
Now when I come down, I be throwing up the South
Ice in our mouth, Wreckshop and Swishahouse

We got the braids and fades, and ride 4's and blades
Looking laid in the 'Sacci, or the Gucci shades

Candy red smash, syrup make you lean fast
19 with screens, playing Sega Dreamcast

[Slim Thug]
That candy blue or that green, gon keep our slab looking clean
Watching a movie on my screen, when I pull on the scene

In the new Coupe, chunk the deuce out the hoo-doo
Taper fade playa made, Iceberg or FUBU

And I splurge the Iceberg, and drink gallons of syrup
With a why-2G bird, valeted on the curb

Them tops still dropping, the trunk still popping

Evil lurks in my mind, though I'm tryin to find peace

These niggas holdin the piece, cock the hammer, heard it click
Gun held in my hand, but the glock it didn't spit
Niggas takin my shit, I ran my clothes and my shoes
??? robbin a nigga, kill his ass if he move
But why'all ain't killin Lavell, without a fight tonight
Nigga, I ain't never did shit, I been a muthafuckin victim

Swoop his ass up out his vines

What's the deal if I still feel 
like I won't kill 'cause I just can't pay my bills
And my got damn girl won't take her pills
Make a nigga want to play the field, pray for real
Hopin all my partners stay for real
Can you say boy Crooked Lettaz ain't for real?

You done made a deal, 'cause ya tape don't hit

Stick, move, can't, lose, do them shows, pay them dues

But then they lie to a brother, now my mind ain't right
'Cause if God is white, and black folks ain't shit
But they know that he wasn't, but they couldn't run the risk
Of their town praisin one who looked more like ???

But I'll tell you like this, should'nt take the risk 
Knowin the consequences well 
The suicidal suckers end up in hell 
Some rather be dead then living in sin 
'Cause the planet is fucked up and misled 
By fools like you 
Runnin round tellin mother fuckers what they can and can't do 
Butterflies in my stomach 
Make me want to vomit 'cause I know doomsday is coming 
Jason's facin' life or death, it's do or die 
And as he take a deep breath he wonders who will cry 
The only one who really cares is you and I 
But your the only one who really knew why 
Life's a bitch from beginning to end and then you die 
Living the life of sin and why 
I can see it in your eyes I'm not surprised 
As you cross your heart and hope to die 
Living your life on the edge of panic 
But still you manic 
'Cause you was born a schizophrenic 
Never knew life was a bitch, but it is so hard 
I'm living low in the graveyard 
Take a trip to another side another place 
Lying in a casket wit a dead man's face 
Who gives a fuck about you, nobody but you 
But I didn't have to tell you take 'cause that's something you already knew 
Just like a razor to the wrist I'm a cut you quick 
Last dying words is I'm a son of a bitch 
Son of a gun and I've just begun to bleed 
As I scream Jesus christ and fall to my knees 
And as everyone cries they wonder why 
I cross my heart and hope to die 
My rhyme is a nine to the forehead 
And once you push play you'll pull the trigga and now your dead 
A suicidal, homicidal, homicidal, suicidal recital 
Is what I recite when I'm on the mic 
At midnight I'll smother you like crib death 
And find my record spinning 
You'll never no I was grinnin when I did that 
This is the you-N-H-O-L-why 
Deadly, like pesticide 
So just step aside 
Once I knew a little girl was playin my tape on Sunday 
They found her in some headphones dead on Monday 
Hanging from a chandelier the only thing to fear is fear 
When you get them butterflies you know the Unholy is near 
Some disappear and never be found 
Some are smothered by the rhythm and then drown 
And when I blow your mind your won't know why 
You'll soon cross your heart and hope to die",Cross My Heart,1990

I was dazey crazy for the ho 
The bitch took my feelin's and phazed me, I know 
I shoulda watch my back but I did'nt so 
My hate for the ho begins to grow 
I met her a month ago 
It was'nt bout money though 
As far as I could see her personality was cool 
So I talked and talked, my intention's was to bone her 
But I found myself likeing her and bein all up on her 
She teased with the pussy had my mind in the Twilight Zone 
It was like dial-a-porn whenever we talked on the phone 
I'm asking her ""Wassup, when you gone let me hit it?"" 
She said ""Right now, I'm hot and horny, hurry come and get it."" 
I reached her house in a minute, I was all up in it 
First time ever fucked her, damn it was splended 
The bitch had my mind goin' loopty loop 
I was pussy whipped up like grandmas soup 
Had me in a state of shock while she was ridin my jock 
Sweat dripped off my balls cuz the walls was hot 
She was sucking me and fucking me like the freak on the flick 
Then I sucked on her titties while she rode my dick 
She said ""Please be gentle, hold me dont let go"". 
And all I was thinking was ""oh..oh"" 
Bare with me brotha, I dont know what I was thinkin of 
I'm thinkin how could makin fuck turn outta makin love 
Slowly as I fucked her, she called me Harry 
She called Charles, Earl, James, and Larry 
I took three more strokes and then bust a nut 
Come to find out my dream girl was just a slut 
The freak of the week, I did'nt stop to think 
How many's made you scream girl, nasty dream girl

Blaze my J and take a strong toke 
Then (coughs) choke off the true smoke

The Time has come for the blood to run into the streets paved with gold 
We have lived in the zoo of the ghetto for so long 
And like animals we kill each other for the hatred of others 
We must move into the suburbs and punish the rich for their ignorance 
For the horror of death  that is part of our life in our neighborhood 
And give them a taste of the same 
And when we kill the governments children 
And the streets smell of death 
Maybe then we will see our situation in a new light 
And put an end the the chaos in the ghetto and an end to the killings

Go on into a world, filled up wit lust a hate
Little do I know about life, but I'm still learnin
First I'mma journey through hell, without burnin
Livin in the ghetto, the Devil is now a black man
I saw him standin in the corner wit the crack man
Little do I know, this hell is now my home
Since birth the peace I blown, is now gone
Like the death, days passed, I'm still growin
Death is my fate, and this hell but never knowin
When, but how do I survive without sin
But thou shall not kill was my first
Then I broke off Ten Commandments, I guess I'm doomed to go to hell
But I'm already there, so tell another tale
From the dark side of myself, I'm entangled

Sold my soul, and now I'm the master
My mother sings the blues, and drinks the booze
And then she praise to save my soul from bad news
Tears fall, I hear my mother call on the Lord
Tonight I be playin in my room, on the Ouija boards
Screamim red rum at the top of my lungs
When I close my eyes, visions of bodies bein hung

Cross my heart, and hope to die, is on my grave
Written on my tombstone, rest in peace
Ridin body in the ground, as the maggots feast
You see I live so fast, but died so young
Another victim of another one, drinkin his red rum
I'm fallin from the heavens and I'm on my way
To meet my maker, the undertaker, 'cause now is judgment day
My soul is hot, and my body is all rotten
Another angel falls from the heaven, forgotten

To the yellow freak, freaky deak, fuckin niggas every week
Bound to get a pink of loose, bitch
Let me a pink gin and crack corn, and I don't care
Jimmy got Shawn, and that ain't fair
You want to get my dough, be a ho
And then you gotta fuck the crew
(No, no) Bitch, decide and play
And if you want to be grown, I'mma fuck you underage
Say you under weight, nothin to say
But damn, he ain't shit
It's all about bitches, hoes, case closed
You want to get busy, take off your clothes
And I'mma show you how I operate
The devil's in your suit, so you best to bait
I got a finger in your pussy and my dick in your mouth
Ticklin ya tassels, turnin ya out
You say you don't dick, bitch that's bull
You'se lickin on my balls, tryin to talk wit ya mouth full
Now you want to front wit ya smelly cunt
But when I come over ya house, you know what I want
Don't give me no lip, 'cause I'mma done on your tits
And when I leave your house, you say it ain't shit",Dumb Bitch,1992
Esham,"Red, black, and green, you know what I mean? 
Like the devil did all this shit
This is judgment day
Jesus Christ is black
This is judgment day
Jesus is white with blond hair, and blue eyes 
This is judgment day
Do black people get in heaven, mommy, huh? 
This is judgment day
And as leader of the KKK, kill all niggers! 
Judgment day, 666, no time to pray, so don't say amen
We're headin' for Armageddon
I'm bleedin' as I'm sweatin'
As I walk the flatlines, we're runnin outta time
Dead by day is what I said sometimes though
I'd rather be dead is what I said so take it slow
Time to pay back, so hit the play back
Visions of killin' preachers in a psychotic flash back
God's gonna get me, that's what they told me a minute ago
The fallen angel strangle seven row
And in that time I learned one thing, jack
Follow the yellow brick road, and don't look back
Now they tryin' to get me, but I'ma get you first
The unholy dead, so now I think it's much worse
Good and evil collide, Jeckel and nigga hyde
Put 'em together and you get another homicide
Suicidal tendencies tend to get in the way
Face your sins, Armageddon, it's judgment day
Day of judgment, God is calling! 
And as God has struck the hour
Thou shall not sin, so I grin as I sing a song
Who the fuck are you, to tell me what's right and wrong? 
Death is in my eyes, I wear no disguise
You're gonna pay for those little white lies
No more Mr. nice guy, I filibuster
When I said fuck you, I was disgusted
But you can't trust it, 'cause I can't trust it
Reverend Swagger, the preacher busted
You're goin' to hell, for all your sins
Pins and needles, needles and pins
Voodoo doctor, on the rocks with vodka
The preacher got busted with a whore, got ya! 
Man on the moon, but still can't fly right
Now he's gonna fake his death, he can't die right
Selling Bibles on the corner but you'll pay
For all your sins, it's judgment day
Day of judgment, God is calling! 
Satan laughing spreads his wings, Oh lord yeah! 
You mutha fuckin' sinner, blind ass bitch
Stealin' from the poor, just to get rich
Judgment day, you're gonna pay and you'll burn
They're gonna tie your ass to a stake and let ya burn
For all that punk ass shit you tried, Praise the lord! 
Bitch be quiet! 
'cause you can't brain wash me, I'm not brain dead
You're better off takin' two to the head
Judgment day, Armageddon is on it's way
Now the last thing you want to do is pray
You say you're sorry for all those things you did
But that don't work
You say you're sorry for all those souls you stole
But that don't work
You say you're sorry for stealin' that money out the collection plate

Tonight all the dead in the cemetery will dance
The witch is on the broom stick, she put me in the mix
Now it's time to teach an old dog new tricks
You can't learn, so I burn your Holy Bible
Let's take a trip into my mind I'm suicidal
I'll get'cha locked inside my brain cell
And turn the world upside-down and make it rain hell
I know you can't see, I'm not your G-O-D
I got my soul on wax, I spin it back as I melt wax
The unwritten, rhymes forbidden, but still hittin'
The you-N-H-O-L-why and I ain't bullshittin'
Pray all night and day, my soul might be saved
I make dead bodies roll over their graves
I drop one, drop two, and then 3, 4
After that I'll scream God I can't wait for more

WAKE THE DEAD

Wakin' up D-E-A-D bodies around me
And I'm from motherfuckin' motown G
Blood stains all in the river 'cause I'm slittin' throats
Bodies chokin' and croakin' when I hit a note
Rotten, gone but not forgotten
Breathe your last breath 'cause the rhyme was death
So yes y'all, get off the wall for the psycho
Alfadiscobeta vinyl
Aquadoodoo, rock my voodoo
I'm kinda wicked when I kick it thought you knew
I get funky in the joint, but what's the point
Esham and I'm from D motherfuckin' troit
Back up off me I'm black like coffee
I rock for the suicidalists not the softees
Up and at 'em, I'm runnin' at 'em I got 'em scared
Now watch the devil get loose as I wake the dead

WAKE THE DEAD

I never fall back, I'm not a new jack
I get to sayin' wicked shit and get a flashback
I gotta unholy mind brain, money dollar insane poetry
To all the people that knowin' me
Some say I'm crazy for kickin' my looney tunes
When I drop bass, my shit goes boom
Never ever fake shit, on stage I break shit
And when I'm rockin' it you know it's the shit
I'm never stuck up so shut the fuck up
'Cause talkin' some shit about me will run your luck up
Headbangers bang your head to wake the dead
The red rum or is the rum red
From a black man, killa rap man
I'm not the caped crusaed named Batman
I like it louder, I'll make it prouder
I'll make your system blow up like gun powder
Yes yes y'all, that's what I'm sayin'
All the headbangers bang your head to wake the dead

The black devils back and gotta step into the mix
The brand new rhymes and the 6 6 6
I shipwreck shit, shit gets wrecked
When I hit the set what the fuck you expect?
PO be a motherfuckin' but a two timin' bitch
I'm not a crossover, don't plan to switch
I rob the rhythm like I was a witch
Nine dead bodies throw 'em in the ditch
You want to try me out to come and test my style
I'll cut 'cha head off and throw it in the pile
I'm versatile, the voodoo child
Don't sweat the technique, but peep the tech style
Gettin' wicked 'cause I'm raisin' hell

6 6 6 and a mic in my hand
6 6 6 and a mic in myyyyy hand

The you-N-H-O-L-why flow for the track
Cut your head off and fuck you so I know where you're heads at
Might slip n slide yo and if it's not a wet one
After I bust my nut on George Jetson
And leave no doubts
I'll put my foot up in your ass and kick your fuckin' pussy out
I'm not a romantic, I leave 'em panting
I'm a psychotic, lunatic, pschitsophrantic
I gotta tattoo of a dick on my foot
So when I kick you in your ass I'll be fuckin' you up too
Roll wit me, roll wit me
If I chopped off your head the police'll come and get me
I gotta ax for all the new jacks
When I swing I know where your heads at

(CHORUS)

I'm the mister with the musical mad shit
Mannick depressant, but it's still kinda bad shit
I can get funky too
Or break me a good car like a honkey too
But I'm no white boy
I'll slit your throat in the middle of the night, boy
Killers don't talk, but stalk the streets
I'm like a cannibal cookin' some dead meat
I'm down with RLP
25 preachers in a church couldn't save me
I roll like a maniac
Some say I'm insane for that, rap brainiac
Listen to the funky drummer
Or listen to the screams of the victims of Jeffrey Dahmer
Plus you don't understand
You can't kill a dead man

Pump that buck and you might catch a hot one
Call me a head hunter, head's I've chopped off
Cemetery's full from the bodies I dropped off
Mothafuckaz hate me, 'cause I'm singing Blasphemy
Die and go to hell and when you get there ask for me
Come along for the ride, drive you to suicide
I'm the Unholy Esham, that's right
Get me a razor blade and I might jack a spade
Or jack jack my dick to a poor porno flick
Nasty motherfucker with the wicked mentallity
Thirteen ways is a small technicallity
'cause I got one, blow your fuckin head out
Pull your fuckin eyes out, just to get the red out
If you be a nigga or a white boy honkey
I get funky, hip hop junkie
Serial killa, frosted flakes

Buyin that ticket to the heavens, can't afford to

Sick in the head, knotty like a dread
Pump that lead 'cause I'd rather be dead
Gimme what you got if you hip you get with me
I think my wrist is talking to you tellin you to slit me
Suicidalist and I'm unorthadox
Down with the black sox, whiskey on the rocks
You might catch me in a jail cell with a wig
I slaughtered me a pig, but you can't dig
The voices in my head, tellin me to waste ya
Pig that Bacon ham sandwich I can taste ya
Everybody lookin for a bible to touch
We shall overcome is a bit too much
But you can't touch this
Religion is some hokus-pokus
Betcha seein god when you focus
But when the day comes and you gotta run for shelter
Now you screamin Hellterskellter
Damn, you gotta turn off the T.V.
Or don't blame me.

I said get on down, get yo ass on down.
I don't give a god damn about radio play
'Cause I do what I want to do anyway

I can slit my wrists if I want to
By the time I get to Arizona
I'm not from L.A. or New York
I chill in Detroit, on the sidewalk

City slicka, drink a little liquor
Want to see a trick? Suck my dick
B-Boy, down for my town

Call me the be	-D
The Unholy Esham's crankin out your CD
Man that's sweet
Beat's get broke but I still rock break beats

Call me some kinda fool
When I was ten I got kicked outta Sunday school
The reverend don't like me
He said 3 times, 3 times, 3 times, 2 is me

I don't give a fuck bout nothin but get paid
Take it how you want to take it
Money, make it how you want to make it

I'm not frontin on the facts man
It's just like that

'Cause it really doesn't matter to me

My pockets gettin fatter you see
Fuck this and fuck that

Make you want to bite it like a cookie

Kick that acid, drop it on your tongue
Or just pass it to get on down

Nut in the speaker so it bumps the right way
Call me Unholy

Holy I'm not, cross me and get shot
Motherfuck a preacher
Fuck college, without dollars they don't teach ya
Shit but how to be broke

Esham,"My Life in the sunshine, the sun don't shine too much on mine. 
But I feel funny wayss on sunny days, honey plays, money pays but keep in on sunny days. 
Used to be my baby, but now you just the neighborhood kid. 
And I'm thinkin bout' the things I did, just to make ya' happy. 
Scoop ya' scrappy, but listen to the nappy pappy. 
It's all about money, It's all about mo' money, and it's gettin mo funny 
In the sunny days. I think about my wicked ways, juices got me crazed, so crime pays. 
Puttin' in work doin' my dirt, and I'm the one that ends up gettin hurt. 
Just for a piece a' puss', a piece of bush, and now the next man's gettin tha' toosh. 
I Guess I know next time, but for now I'm just losin' my mind, cause' I'm caught up in the sunshine. 

[Chorus] 
(Samples: My life My life, in the sunshine) 
In the sunshine, I'm fellin' kinda' mellow, watch the crackhead say hello. 
I'm just a little ghetto boy ghetto child, runnin' wild with the freestyle. 
I dropped out a school to clock papers. 
Now when the niggas see me, they clock vapors. 
Watchin' them Dayton's hit the sunlight, so I hold my gun tight. 
Everybody out to get me, see my minds playin tricks with me, so don't bullshit me. 
I used to have some homies, but see I dissed all my homies, so now I'm kinda' lonely. 
But it's all about me, but it's too head for me ta' see, through my jealousy. 
A nigga caught me slippin at a red light, 2 shots/2 shots to my dome, now I'm dead right. 
Through thick and thin homies should stay tight. 
That's all I was thinkin' bout', With my brains blew out, 
In the sunshine. 
[Chorus]
In the sunshine, niggas feel good, smokin herbs, chillin in the hood. 
Shoot a little dice, fuck a little hoe, and then some nigga try to rob the liquir store. 
They shot em' in the back on the way out, like a sucka' what a way to go out. 
Tried to steel some bread to feed his babies, they said crack babies neighborhood crazy. 
Now I guess the babies don't eat, bloody daddies head dead in the street. 
And their ain't no rainbows where the cocaine flows. 
That's where ya' go when you try to behave hard. 
I guess he'll know next time. 
But his babies losin' they minds, in the sunshine.

You're better off dead. 
You should kill yourself. 
You should kill yourself. 
You should kill yourself. 

I hear voices in my head, tellin' me go ahead, 
Something in my mind says, I'm better off dead. 
13 ways and still countin' them down, 
Nine bodies floatin' in the river and never found. 

Seems like I'm drownin' in my own conception, 
I'm my worst enemy with no exception. 
Cross my heart, and hope to die in many ways, 
I look on the bright side, but there's no better days. 

Voices are callin' me, but I can't call 'em back, 
I drown my sorrows in a bottle of Kodiak. 
People say what's the matter, the sounds of pitter patter, 
I'm losin' my mind as I'm walk up Jacob's ladder. 

Can I find sanity, you hear what I'm sayin' man? 
Something keeps tellin' me to kill myself, 
God damn. 
They think I'm better of dead, 

But I'm losin' my mind man, 
I hear voices in my head. 
You're better off dead, you're better off dead(4x) 
I hear voices in my head. You're better off dead(3x) 

Oh Lord,(Kill yourself.) 
I hear voices in my head, but I can't shut 'em up, 
Tellin' me to go to sleep in the tub, and never wake up. 
You want to talk to me, tell me somethin' I don't know, 

When the wind blows, they come but they never go. 
Lookie, lookie, lookie as I'm losin' my mad mind, 
Sanity and insanity, seeds intertwine. 
Russian Roulette, 'cause I'm kinda upset man, 

Will I regret it in a bloody silhouette? 
Time will tell, if I'm going to hell, 
Took the test of life, and I believe I failed. 
Stop who's callin' me, 

I can hear you but can't see, 
Could it be Dr. Kevorken, or Derrick, or Tunney? 
Takin' the final step, the final extra snap, 
Doctor asistant suicide, what's so complex? 

The right to die is yours, you're better off dead, 
My mind's playin' tricks on me, 
'Cause I hear voices in my head. 
You're better off dead(4x) 

I hear voices in my head 
You're better off dead(3x) 
Oh Lord(Kill yourself) 
I got the will to live, but not the right to die, 

The voices tell me, I live my life in a lie. 
I want to get rid of me, myself, and I, 
Red Rum's on my mind with no alibi. 
I got misconceptions, of life itself, 

Everything I do, hazardous to my health. 
I got the witch on my back, to catch a heart attack, 
Common sense on over, common sense I lack. 
I got the symptoms of insanity, drivin' me insane, 

Sendin' myself through pain, as I walk in the rain. 
I try to close my eyes and say it's all a dream, 
The voices will whisper, and then they start to scream. 
I grab my head in pain, I grab my gun again, 

Could it be I'm just lonely, or just going insane. 
I lay my head on the pillow inside a bloody bed, 
I got my gat in my hand, man, 
I'm a kill these voices in my head. 

I can't take it no more..

Sick though, when I hitchya with the wicked rhyme
Stickin' it in your mind, rewind the Flatline
Unload, explode, here's the new episode
Paranoia, can't do nuttin for ya
Helter skelter, mind melter, if I feltchya
If I die, I'm goin to Hell, who do ya tell?
Run from the Devil, gotta shovel, gravedigga
How you gonna kill a dead nigga, if you figure I'm dead?
Here's the oops upside ya head
Here's a hot piece a lead, an instead I walk the Flatline

If I'm on the Flatline's, it means I'm 'bout to lose my mind
Death is the seventh sign, and I'm runnin' outta time, so check this
I'm a suicidalist, that means I ain't afraid to die
If I play the game of death, that means I play the game to die
Russian roulette, hit my two and reenact the fooly
Unruly, you'll see me lose my cool G

Cock the hammer, and when it slams, God damn, (gunshot) bam

Well I walk the Flatlines and I'm 'bout to lose my grip
Gotta gun in my hand, wrapped around my finger tips
If I slip then I might catch a hole in my head
Sceamin' out bloody redrum, for somethin I said um
My minds goin Bedlam, flash backs of Rambo
So much pressure, I grab the ammo off my dresser
I'm shakin', I start to tremble, for Jack Me Nimble
My mind starts crashin' like a symbol, and I'm in limbo
To calm me down I think I better count to ten
But I only made it to nine, I did a Flatline

Walkin on the flatlines fumblin with the razor blade
Rumblin with the ace of spade is where the wicket rhymes are made
Sometimes I really feel like
I just can't deal with the pressures of life
So I walk around with the bloody butcher knife
Therapy,man I need some therapy cause ain't nobody scarin me
I ain't got no love cause no one cares for me
Slippin it into to darkness I'm beyond that and pass that
Once I catch a flashback
Snap and that's yo ass
Black Devil get a shovel,grave digga
How you figure you gon' kill a dead nigga
You gon kill a dead nigga
Bloody body baby bloody man I'm nutty what he thought
Nine dead bodies and I never got caught
Walk the flatlines,man I walk the flatlines
And dead body chalk lines make me walk lines
I don't sniff lines .45 slug to my mind
Sometime
I feel I'm on the flatline
Man I need some therapy

I'm having suicidal thoughts
Brain cells dead from the coma
My aroma dead body rotten gone but not forgotten
Seems like you forgot
Man I took one shot
Now I lay me down to sleep body hot rot
Got no love when I was a toddler
Now I swallow bullets for fun playin games with the gun
Hope I spit up,get up,throw up,mind blow up
I told my teacher I want to be like Hitler when I grow up
Now I got a mental block got the pussy hammer cocked
Tick tock and ya don't stop make the pussy pop

When I did dirt, I was alone

Murdered my homie in his cherokee
I saw that nigga at the mcdonalds drive through, so I pulled up to his ???
And unloaded my dumper
He had, his bitch and his baby in the car
But I didn't give a fuck, automatically unloaded, all of they asses got struck
187 on my pistol bullets to throw away

[chorus]
One day I'ma die, mama don't cry
Ain't no heaven up in the sky
One day I'ma fade away
And set the world on fire, watch the sky turn grey 2x

I was born to mourn,I guess that's why I live the life of misery
Forever through eternity
My mama was a junkie, I was born into this world a crack baby
My bottle was brass monkey
I developed a brain tumor,now I consume a half ounce of Rose
I sniff bullets with my snub nose
I grew up on the east side, 7 mile area
I was raised like a pitbull terrier
I developed a criminal behavior
I murdered my first man and knew Jesus Christ wasn't my savior
Jehovah witness,witnessed me takin care of my business
So I shot him on the front porch
I took their bibles and burned em
I checked their pockets, turned em inside out
Dumped their bodies in the lake with the trout
It all started as a toddler,now I'm a .45 bullet swallower
And mama don't cry

[chorus]

Somehow it seems,mama calling my name in my dreams
Crackfiends, amphetimenes, what does it really mean
Sometimes it feels like I'm fallin,am I close to death
Gaspin,suffocatin for air,losin my breath
I see visions of doctors and scalpels makin incisions
>From fatal collisions to suicide decisions
Nobody knows my suffering
I bring the pain from my migrane, I swallow 23 bufferins
I was addicted to caine since birth
Crack baby goin crazy, so how much is my life worth
A baby boy that bounces
36 ounces I flip,kilograms I slam from the hip
It's kinda crazy how I'm livin
But I'm mad on a murder ride nigga I'm suicide driven
I've arisen from a dead state-of-mind to find I was blind,too late
Mama don't cry

[chorus]

If I could start all over I would
But I can't,if I could,then my heart might have been good
I guess I lost all my time when I lost my mind
It makes me sad to hear mama cryin
So many dyin
I never stopped to think what I put you through
Much love,I thought you hated me,mama I never knew
I guess I walked the wrong path
In the aftermath,many demons screamin my name
You don't know the half
I was dead a long time ago
Never ressurected,once the .45 shell connected
With my dome,I saw my misery crack a smile
So put my dead body in the pile
And wait a while till you come to the cemetery
'cause you might see my tombstone burnin 'cause it's necessary

Why? Every time I headbutt a brick wall, I always crack my skull, why?
Why? Every time I stab somebody, I'm always gettin' my clothes bloody, why?
Why? Every time I drive down the wrong of the street, everybody want to beep, why?
Why? Every time I bunk and I sell rock, I wind up in a cell block, why?
Why? Every time I shoot somebody in the face, pigs get to chase, why?
Why? Every time I drink a little gasoline, I shit my spleen, why?
Why? When I try to fly like a birdy
I wind up on a gurdy, dead tell me why

Won't you tell me why? Someone tell me why?
Jesus tell me why? I was born to fly

Why? Every time I choke a friend's neck, he don't come back, why?
Why? Every time I stab my eyes with an icepick, I can't see shit, why?
Why? Every time I play chicken with a train, it wins the game, why?

Come through ya town, put it down like a parade
See I come from Detroit and it's all about Dylan
When I Black Jack five dollas stacked to the ceiling

Blaze green all day, tell me what do ya smell
Bump the beat up in city heat, double-oh-7

You and them 'Shady' suckas is nothin' but cowards

Took the money left the war, but I'll get more and more

I slipped and I fell, got up and ran like hell
Dropped my gun runnin through this jungle
I ain't tryin to get caught with no bundles
Cops yellin freeze I hear one say there his gun goes
I don't want to go to the lock-up, the officer picked my glock up
All I heard was sirens and police cars surroundin the block up

Fleein and a loon tryin ta hit me with a felon
Caught with possession and attempt to deliver, drug sellin
Survelence saw me servin plaques on the street hellin
Ain't no tellin if somebody snitch or not when you makin nots
All I know is I toss my dope sack police chase me around the block it's hot

I don't recommend doing your Shit for you
You just a hoe, and you can't do what I do

It's hard to perform under these circumstances
Penitentiary chances
Watch the devil when he dances
You'll need an ambulances, puttin' em in trances

Hypnotize, watch you wake up when I snap my fingers
Open ya eyes, open ya eyes

I take this war shit deeply, peep me
Never hang where the weak be
Always woke, never sleepy
I keep the uzi and I'll wet you like a jacuzzi

Kick shit like a Suzuki, hit you wit' the Horuki
Back up off of me
What the fuck
Niggas get that cash up

Hoes bounce that ass up
Back up off of me
What the fuck

Paranoid insane
Schizophrenic

I'm manic 
Depressed
Stressed the fuck out
Keep the heat on me at all times
So my shirt it kinda stuck out

Don't make me draw down and buck out
'Cause where I'm from when the guns bust
They leave ya fuckin' guts out

[Chorus]

So many rules and regulations
Bein' broke, death by speculation

How can I obtain the power through manifestation
Immortalized and bomb mummification

What am I supposed to do, congratulate you?
Whatever...
How you in love wit her, when every thug hit her
Just met her off a lap dance now you babysit her
And get her everything she need
From pills to weed
Bite into the forbidden fruit like Adam and Eve
I can't believe you all in, when the snake bitch crawlin'
Watch her slither, body glitter
I know you did her, you was wit' her when she shed her skin
She gave you head again to make sure the venom sunk in
Poison, she fucked all your boys and brought the sex toys in
Vibrators, she said she was a dick hater
She didn't want you to fuck her, just masturbate her
Now you in love wit' the hoe

[Chorus:]
You in love wit' that hoe [11x]

Now this is some sick shit said
I'm smackin' bitches wit my dick head
And yellin' 'all tricks dead'
And if you paid for the pussy ain't nothin' wrong
To her you just anotha nigga pealin' off ya Sean Jones
This hoe love pullin' down jabodes
Behind closed doors, niggaz ready to bust those
But some niggaz be like 'I love you'
We like 'Fuck you dyke, suck a pussy too'
The bitch is raw, I mean yo bitch is raw
Sucked the milkshake straight out the straw
Flippin' up outta her drawers like Dominique Dawes
Now you runnin' round tellin' niggaz she all yours

[Chorus:]

I love you
I love you
I love you
I love you
How you love that hoe when you know what she is
Got five baby daddies and eight different kids
Her last man did a bid for some shit that stank bitch did
Now she pregnant wit' your kid so you wish you slid
Last week you said you loved her and you can't get ridda her
This week she gave you crabs and gave your ass Cymatia
Fuck you Ms. Jackson, I still don't pity ya
Bitches lie and suck dick after dick
And still some niggaz can't cope wit' it
And be like...
'I love you, I need you'
Fuck that!
'You my girl, you my girl, fuck whatchu niggaz say, man'

First of all I stab people, like even myself
I wouldn't advise it though doc it fucks up my health
I hang out with bad people we cause mischief and mayhem
People like Shaggy and that E-S-H-A-M
I panic over everything man, my faucets they drip
I headbutted my mom over that shit and swelled up her lip
(Urgh) She hit me with a big wooden spoon
I ran into the bathroom
I took off my panties and sat there and cried and took a dune
Plus I hide in bushes, and I play with my dick
Wait! Did I say I had panties on?
Scratch that shit!
Anyway, them bushes I'm jerking my dick off
Yet possums are looking I get off
Tell me how to stop my panic attack!!

I popped off all my pills they told I should pop some more

Wait, no I don't

Pain pills, feel my addiction
I'm caught up in the mix and plus I need fixin'
This is fact not fiction, bitch, why you bitchin'
Take a listen witcha ears and close ya mouth
Wash it down wit' some water before ya pills fall out
In the darkness I hear somebody call out my name
When I think about the past all I see is the flames
Angels try and save me but I'm crazy
They say 'Follow me' but I can't fly wit' these broken wings
And 'Tongues' are spoken things
Don't know what they mean, nightmares that I'm a dope fiend
Insomniac, I don't sleep, I can't dream
The voices say 'Follow me' the pills say 'Swallow me'
I gotta migraine, dead brain cells
Anphenamines flowin' through my veins takin' me to hell
Can't you tell I'm in another dimension
Can't you tell I'm in another dimension
Hell on earth and I got a life sentence
The only way to get to Heaven's repentance

I'm twistin' bitches up like the dreads on a Rasta
I'm gunnin' atchu rappers 'cause you just an imposta

And for self, after years I got no help
Tremendous, the bad times, they seemed endless
I spin this bottle, I mash this throttle

I keep this ammo to burn like a candle
'cause I'm too cold to hold, too hot to be handled
I dismantled every mic I touch, so realize why I don't give a fuck

And I'm killin' all you wack ass rappers that's sloppy
And bitin', rewritin', refightin' 'Clash of the Titans'
When I see you I'm strikin', you feelin' lightning
No remorse of course for the Pale White Horse
Make 'em all feel the force when I come for yours
Kickin' down ya doors, world hood wars
To even the score, make all devils pray to the Lord
To scheme like a demon, you can't really afford

With the ones who ""Bang Bang"", make your brains hang, and it is a thing 
Bitch, better have my motherfucking fetty

To the streets of Hell. These boys ain't no foreigners 
And warrin' is every day, and the cost ain't soft 
Even when they miss, you still get a shoulder blown off

And wash it down with everclear cause the care ain't there 
And these boys be the bad guys, and can't switch

Up on the block straight doing the Aero Flyn

Then I'm a be busting my gun 
This ones for the boys saying fuck the ""5-0"" 
Fuck the 5-0 when it's all about survival 
Talkin' to my pistol don't help 
My shotgun said ""blasphemy"" until I shot on myself 
This one's for the money figures 
The go-getters, ice-rockers 
Twenty-four seven non-stoppers 
This ones for the pill poppers 
Eh yo fuck that, this ones for the head-choppers

This one's for the people livin' down in them sewer pipes 
Makin' a living off of all that ain't right 
And this is for them witches that was tied to stakes 
And for the killers that have seen me after death shakes 
And them peddlers on the corner when it's ice-cold 
And dead bobies on the side of the road 
This is for that part of the city that everybody warns about 
Where throats get torn out

In Detroit, everybodys hungry, trying to hussle 
In Detroit, nobodys got a deal with Russel 
In Detroit, you'll be lucky if your not a victim of a shooting 
In Detroit, crack-head zombies still prostituting 
In Detroit, where the underground rap don't get played on the airwaves 
Unless, pull or push, men got payed 
In Detroit - bitch, you ain't even from Detroit 
Fuck your rap, 7 mile is where the hustlers at 
In Detroit, ain't no fucking freestylin, ain't no time for that 
Got twenty-fours on the eighty-four Regal and I'm grindin

In Detroit, it's cocaine 
In Detroit, don't play no hoe games they'll blow out your brains.

In Detroit, where the bitches and niggas, they live wild 
In Detroit, where you find the dope game is shitty 
In Detroit, where the bitches show assholes and titties 
In Detroit, where the niggas and bitches, they build cars 
In Detroit, we got hoodrats and ghetto stars 
In Detroit, we ain't taking no shit from nobody 
In Detroit, we got Sammy the Bulge and John Gotti 
In Detroit, we got pimps and players, hoes and macks 
In Detroit, we ride Regals, Chevys, and Cadillacs 
Gettin money by the stack from the rap for the crack 
In Detroit, its like that, liquor stores for the blunt and 
In Detroit, we got arabs that look like Bin Ladin 
In Detroit, we got bitches and niggas that stay plottin 
In Detroit, we stay rottin, forgive but not forgotten 
Potatoes stay au gratin, come close and catch a hot one

In Detroit, you can be a victim of the ghetto 
In Detroit, got more rock than heavy metal 
In Detroit, bitches slide down the pole butt-naked 
In Detroit, some real and some fake it, some snake it 
In Detroit, mu'fuckas just hope they make it 
In Detroit, I can't take it, so I just wanna break shit 
Detroit got some winners, Detroit got some losers 
Detroit got the best dope-dealers and drug-abusers 
And I be the rabbit-killer, the killer who kill rabbit 
In Detroit they bust automatics at trailer park addicts 
Across 8 mile in Detroit, you hate my style 
Soopa Villain in Detroit, I'm at the top of the pile

In Detroit, got the fix for you niggas who broke 
In Detroit, we got the weed, speed, raw, and coke 
In Detroit, where the bums will rush your ass 
Where the little old ladies do the hundred-yard dash 
In Detroit, where the bitches look fine as Hell 
But if you slap that bitch up, you gotta go to jail 
In Detroit, we got the space-age futeristic 
Nigga, check my statistics, my number is unlisted 
In Detroit, where you got to be fly as Hell 
With your attitude shitty like your shit don't smell 
In Detroit, aim big ya got east to west 
North end to the end, and down to southwest 
And don't forget the HP and small ass hamtraning 
I'm talking 'bout Detroit, understand it, God damn it 
And if you don't know the places I called off 
You probably a weak-ass nigga from the burbs, extra soft.

Forever in the fast lane, never settling
Get dough, sniff blow, get some more, get a O of some dro
Blow some doe with my hoe
You might see me at the MO MO with a thick chaco
I'm a giant robot, you Johnny Socko
Stacking up my chips like Esay at King Taco
Hot like tobasco like me, but you're not though

Drop to they knees and crawl like a dog

The struggle lives hard times, we do or die
My whole crews fly hands high to the sky
So maintain son elevate try to build
But now you're still 'cause incarceration is for real
Yeah son you know its on
Now who would be the clown in the nine-six to mess around and catch a
fist
I show no mercy if you irk me
I got physical that alert me when some herb tried to jerk me
Or put the squeeze on it, break down the cipher
But it won't work, were tight like the Q-Tip in the fight
Now is you insane is your brain intact
We be official when it comes to this no B.S. rap
Here comes the lyrical, aerial raid right where you rest at
Now test that
I snatch your heart right through your chest black
Gettin ill thoughts when I sleep at night
I gotta maintain, blot the blood stains on my brain
>From the clappin, we can make it happen
Remember you ain't a killer, you only rappin
I hate it, rappers over exaggeratin
And never shot a gun in they life, they only masterbatin
So come clean and keep it real if you like my sound
And wave your hands in the air and put the nines down

Brothas fought daily in the streets, we reek havoc
On every block someones flippin like an acrobat
I'm kinda young but I still gotta hold my own
And Ima maintain what's mine till the day I'm grown
I keep my crew up, people say I got a gang
But I don't smoke I don't shoot and my crew don't slang
We just hang tryin to get up in this rap game
So I can gain so fame and build my crews name
Rollin with juvenile thugs wit bad grades and bad ways
Who woulda thought that I had some AIDS
Dream totes and aspirations
Brothas are tired of being broke so maybe that's why they free-basing
Wastin time doing nothing
Livin like an outcast gotta get up get out and get something
[Chorus: 2X]
Look into my eyes see if you can see what I can see
In my reality the whole world is after me
Schemin on the key but yo I got this locked down
Me and lost and found comin out the underground
Takin no prisoners my listeners we keep it real
My thoughts are militant, when I'm in the killin field
Click click, my minds automatic, so where's the static
I got some joints up in my attic if you want to grab it
I form a cipher where my peace brothers don't sleep
You try to creep I guarantee that's when you feel the heat
I come correct in this rap game
Rappers act insane
Meanwhile I'm blowin the mic an back in the frame
They can't see me, they can't feel the real G
I represent, commercial rap will never kill me

Get more papers all I'm hoping
No need to say a word to papers, spoken
Freezer frozen when I'm posing
Passion, cameras, flashing lights and action main attraction
Paper make everything better best believe it, and I love to receive it

Doin' music, spittin' on the hype like me
Eskigirl sprayin' on the stage like me
The first beats she makes will be 'Snowman Remix'
She can make beats like me

And when I play 'Stormy Weather' she gets mad
Put on a screw-face just like me
So I know she's got it, the gift I possess
Avoid the street mess and stay close to me
'Cause money's the key, I run around freely gettin' it
Just so me and you eat

She's daddy's little gal

She knows daddy ain't washed up yet
'Cause I'm livin' in the studio, lost, upset
When I find myself after all this music
I'll be watching her performin' her set

She might wanna be a nurse or a vet
But I'll lop that off 'cause music's best
I cruise for the press like
Who's gonna make an album this good?
Daddy, yes

He's the best and it's two six now
Still no one's testin', most man are resting
I can't rest 'cause you're seven months right now
And I get a big pain in my chest

If I don't see you, I've gotta ring up and check
But one day, we'll receive a big cheque
And fly round the world, I'll show you revision
All I want in return is respect

She's daddy's little gal

And she loves Dada, there's no one above Dada
Dada stands for Big Dada

I'm a real striker, not a goal hanger

Leah, this money's too good by the hour
And it pays by the minute, live PA, that's why I'm in it
See I love money like Nana and Raymond, Patrick and Macca
Them man showed me how to be a stacker

And now I've gotta show you, school you
Throw you in the deep end
'Cause the world's gettin' madder
When you get old the streets will get badder
That's why you've gotta climb the musical ladder
She won't get clouded, just in the manor
I ain't sad, I'm happy I had her

Cause I’m from the hood and I got issues still
If they shoot your pop when you 16 that’s when the shit get real, grip the steel
Damn ain’t this a bitch, ain’t no motherfucking fathers
Put the message out, can’t protect this house with under armor, no
Everybody’s a victim, the vindictive system been dicking us down
Been digging a hole to stick my niggas in
Finish em before we even get started
We been falling before we ever thought of walking
All this heartlessness just evolved
Listen to unconscious loss, niggas monsters
And y’all bitches looking for sponsers, you just slaves

You a slave, them bitches say

I should have never played that waiting game.
I'm so alone now that you're gone,
I was a fool for waiting too long.
 
I wasn't smart, I wasn't wise,
And now I'm by myself with tears in my eyes.

Seconds, hours, minutes they all pass you by
Above your heads, still an empty sky
Shining shies or working mines, is not your favorite waste of time
And never what you had in mind
Gonna have to move on
Or else your life will be gone

Don't set your level too high
Just lower the line of the sky

You missed the bus that never had a stop in your town
Seems it let you down, never came around
No one you knew ever left this place alive

Is it time to set you free?
Is it time to let it fly?
Is it time to let it bleed

To cover up the pain
Deep below it burns

You're gonna find someone new
I really hope you do
'Cause I love you
And the sun will come on through,
It's gonna shine for you
'Cause I adore you
Yes we gave it a try
But maybe for too long
Out of every sorrow
Another day will dawn
You're gonna find someone new
I really hope you do
'Cause I love you
And the sun will come on through,
It's gonna shine for you
'Cause I adore you
And the road travels on

I will still hear you
Still
Sun will shine for you

Where the fire lights
Are candle souls again;

Through the darkness,
Hear it call to us all

And stir again;
This beating heart
Comes again

A homeless child playing with something as simple as a cardboard box and he seems so happy
With that smile on his face like nothing matters he?s so serene
When he doesn?t even know if he?s gonna live through another day worrying about what he?s gonna eat

when I look at that it kinda makes me feel guilty
Cause the world that I?m living in only seems to care about having enough money
To buy luxurious things that we don?t even need
I'm not trying to be the good girl to save the world cause I do the same damn thing


(Chorus)
Isn't it a shame, but we only have ourselves to blame
But love is the most beautiful thing
But its a lost somewhere along the way to money and fame ( to money and fame)
Isn?t the world a crazy place?

we were all brought up with different dreams and beliefs
But the one thing we all need is to be loved by friends and family
And when a child like that with no parents around is able to smile makes me feel very weak, small, and vulnerable

when I look at that it kinda makes me feel guilty cause the world that I?m living in only seems to care about having enough money, to buy luxurious things that we don?t even need

But love is the most beautiful thing
But its a lost somewhere along the way to money and fame (to money and fame)

it makes me conscious of all of the things I have and makes me feel oh so fast
It makes me want to follow my dreams
And tries to be a better person
It takes me to a higher level
It makes me wipe away all? a my tears
It helps me put a smile on my face
Cause everything I need is right here?

isn't it a shame, but we only have ourselves to blame
But love is the most beautiful thing
But it?s a lost somewhere along the way to money and fame ( to money and fame),

If you look for me in the sky, I'm not that far

Now I know I'm just a girl
Trying to make my way through this life
But now I feel bigger then the world
With your hand in mine

Like a speeding bullet
Trying to make my way back through the night
And now I feel bigger then the world
With your hand in mine

And Now I feel bigger then the trees
That hold the leaves
Bigger then the mountains
That touch the seas
Bigger then the night
That leads to day
Bigger then the waves
That crash at bay

Bigger oh ooh, bigger oh ooh
Bigger oh ooh, oh oh ooh

Bigger, er, er ooh

When all of the world seems to get you down
Just know that I'm always gonna be around
My heart's in my head and that's where it'll stay
I love you too much, just like I did today

Now I know I'm just a girl (girl)
Trying to make my way through this life
(Trying to make it through this life)
But now I feel bigger then the world
(Bigger than the world, bigger than the world)
With your hand in mine
(Hand in mine)

Like a speeding bullet
(Oh-ooh oh-oh bigger)
(Oh-ooh oh-oh bigger)

And now I feel bigger then the world (ooh)

Esmée Denters,"It's 11 o'clock and the last time that we talked
He said he's busy and he'd call me but he never called me back (no)
And now I feel like somethings going on
But I feel crazy every time I bring it up so I don't
He told me there's no one above me
And all my friends are telling me different and something seems funny

tell me do you know what's the point of being in love, love, love
I can still hear voices in my head like

I'm tryna tell you little sister
He's running around on ya
Like some Casanova lover
At the expense of your heart
You need to listen to your big brother
I'm just tryna look out for ya
You need to find another
Coz he's playing a part

Why didn't I see it from the start
How was I to know
It would bruise my heart
So fast it had me blind-sighted I couldn't see
Like a wave you took me under now it's so hard to breath

[Esmee Denters] (Justin Timberlake)
And I guess I'm just too young to play with love (hey)
Guess I'm just too young to play with love (sometimes it has to be this way)
I guess I'm just too good to play with love (hey)
I guess I'm just too young to play with love (sometimes you never know hey)

Verse 2:
I shoulda never given into his games
Shoulda only been the type that treat me the same
And it ain't fair coz I gave him all I had now there's nothing left
(these tears wil dry and you'll move on, on and on and on)
This songs the same thing
Can't keep fallin'
No more heartbreak

tell me do you know what's the point of being in love, love, love
Coz I still hear everybody's voice like

I'm tryna tell you little sister
He's running around on you
Like some Casanova lover
At the expense of your heart
You need to listen to your big brother
I'm just tryna look out for ya
You need to find another
Coz he's playing a part

As we floated over the floor
There were questions but my heart knew all the answers
And perhaps a few things more

Now in a cottage built of lilacs and laughter
I know the meaning of the words ""Ever after""
And I'll always see polka dots and moonbeams
When I kiss the pug-nosed dream",Polka Dots and Moonbeams,2000
Esmond Selwyn,"If you hear
A song in blue
Like a flower crying
For the dew
That was my heart serenading you
My prelude to a kiss

If you hear a song that grows
From my tender sentimental woes
That was my heart trying to compose
A prelude to a kiss

Though it's just a simple melody
With nothing fancy
Nothing much
You could turn it to a symphony
A Shubert tune with a Gershwin touch

Oh how my love song gently cries
For the tenderness within your eyes
My love is a prelude that never dies
A prelude to a kiss

Though it's just a simple melody
With nothing fancy
Nothing much

Severing every animal
I'm doing dirt like earthworms
I'm sick and original
Boy, I gave birth to the first germs
I spit the acetate
To make your lips evaporate
The Master Ape
Bare hands will decapitate and bash your face
Pass the eight, sack of shake
Twisted in plasma tape

I come across a substance yet I couldn't lacerate
Virtuoso is an unidentified flying object to make your space shuttle ?
So while you drunks look for a hook and say you masturbate
Telling 7L to sratch a plate
In due for respect I slap your face
Ask to make my specs, I'm a tackle ya
You're a neck and I'm Dracula
Have sex in the back of a black Lex or an Acura
Met with the, Jedi Mind Tricks
We rhyme sick and side ? for dime chicks
I'll strangle you, use my same hands to give you the Heimlick
So you can live to face more punishment from my divine lips

Silencing the devil that speaks with forked tongue

Be the next memeber in the cast of my snuffed vics
Rough shit, don't even attempt sleeping
At war with the demons that live in infernal regions
Spawned from eternal semen bred flesh predators
Wings of the arms when you heels like Pegasus
Grabbing your leg, so you live to the heavenless
Drop this prejudice and follow me to Exodus

Exhume the tomb of Lazarus
You blasphemous
We bring war to pacifists
Tarantulas, burn flesh like a nine glock
Your mind stops from nine of my divine shots

Swing from vines and rhyme like Atilla The Hun

We slap tracks and attack like M. Bison

",Arcane Dissolution,2004
Esoteric,"'Tis but a fucking grey day for me now.
One that I care not to meet.

Wherefore is this grey fucking day,
That I should sit in here now?
Now of all times,
For all times have been now,
Until they became then.

And it grates upon these very nerves,
That move my body amongst the living.
As they seethe,
Shaking their anger throughout my bones... as if to escape...

Such a need to explode.
For this time ticks slowly,
Through this, the greyest of all days.
Waiting for now to become then.

And it tears me apart,
But I cannot escape this terrible pain.
Ripping, devouring the bones within my flesh.
Draining my life's blood.

And wherefore is this fucking grey day,
That I should sit in here again?

And what?
What fucking tale to tell now?
Of tears uncried?

Only the sweat of writhing agony.

The eyes shed no tears...
For a mind gone insane...

Hey yeah ay ya ya

You better know now or know how
We so foul and profound
Blowouts, CD's sold out, the illest no doubt
When ""Celph Titled"" roll out, immaculate respect

""Uzi's"" and ""Tek's"" protect your neck with a teflon turtleneck
Bitch there ain't a diesel cat that could face me
You don't really want to run your mouth and make me
Summon the gods with my mystery chant

And perform the running-man for my victory dance
Murder motherfuckers mostly over money with guns to they tummies
Hollow-tips that leave you stiffer than a mannequin dummy
Record a demo while the ""Demigodz"" make new songs

Your better off running the triathlon with parachutes on
A real bug-nigga, and that's how I'm better known
You make beats, I'd rather rhyme to a metronome
Other crews got ego's but can't floss right
I'll run them over have em' smoking the exhaust pipe

Well well well well well well
Hey yeah ay ya ya

Already proved that all my rhymes are wicked enough
They sleep when you on the mic your fucking ""Jigglypuff""
A big kid jail-fuck, I don't want to grow up
And I don't care what he says yo he can suck a know what

I'm bigger than that, smile when you kicking my raps
Have conversations with your girl while she sits on my lap
Yo stop talking about they girls man it's starting to get old
Well, um, no tell they girls to stop leaving they clothes

The reason I flow, is not to just get us indoors
Pops in barber shops like my son is better than yours
'Cause and effect, ""Rise"" is the effect and the cause
All those who came before I just perfected they flaws

Perfect with clause I have to be look at my town
Neglecting the laws of gravity, I'm not coming down
There's cops on the ground, that look like dots on a map
From the level of where I'm at when I'm dropping, you whack

Well well well well well well
Hey yeah ay ya ya

I rock rhymes that blow ends, drop lines like gold friends
Pull dimes that start trends, while your trying to make amends
Your girls be like you want it, all fives and no tens
Actually the wrong one, you bust with small guns

I look like an MC who murders the spot
Like ""Derek Jeter"" looks like a smaller version of ""The Rock""
Bitch please, I never ever met a dick-tease
I'm so cool that when I spit free's my spit freeze

""Old Yeller"", I'm known to leave a fella
With more cuts and scratches than the ""Shook One's"" acapella
You want to fuck around with ""Esoteric""
And blown on some bullshit like working-dice-credit

When rappers try, they usually step and die
Then MC's get the message like a number I don't recognize
Your call her back, pop minds they hear me freestyle
And spend the next seven days hittin' redial

Well well well well well well
Hey yeah ay ya ya

I keep the planet under my spell, under my reign
I stay on tracks, while throwing rappers under the train
I'm numbing your brain, stunning you while tonguing your dame
I appreciate her, everything that's under her brain

When reciting it's lighting with thunder and rain
A ""Demigod"" that's beyond your small blundering brains
Fortunate fame, really it's just one in the same
That I obtain while your still a bum begging for change

Trying to front like your new and really nothing has changed
You ain't underground, your locked in a dungeon with chains
Your not a thug 'cause' you rock your little ""Lugz"" and a chain
I'm a slug, nah fuck that, I'm double the pain

Your hussling game is lame, couple bucks and a name
Maybe some buckets of champagne with sluts in the range
I'll fuck with your brain and flex so your muscles are strained
Until your nothing but a punk clutching crutches and canes

Esoteric,"Yo Friday night, feelin' right, fuckin' with this bad chick
Gats click, now I'm hit, shit, watch the blood spit
I fall face down, background is H-Town
Needle drag, music stops, people call the cops
For a rap cat, shot dead in the back
Over a dame, for some reason of which I cannot explain
My name was little known at this time
'Less we use the Boston, Mass. as the measuring line
My crime bein waxed, redirects, people's TV's set
Maybe you're seein' the checks, or see 'em as threats
My fam cries at the wake, some guys do steaks
With their eyes on my tape, realizin' my surprisin' fate
Ten-to-five covered, then from five-to-eight
Now the average rap fan starts to gravitate
To the Ese-Esoteric, to see if they were sleepin'
On a dope MC whose skills need peepin'

[Chorus:]
It's tough stayin' underground when you're six feet deep
And major labels profit off of that, but then there's freak
{""It's Esoteric""}, {""Rest in peace""}
And now everybody's checkin' for my posthumous release
{*scratched twice*} ""Death is a final step!"" - RZA
""You know dead rappers get better promotion"" - Jadakiss
""Death is a final step!""

Check.. now as I look down, it's kinda tough swallowin'
The fact that I'm a dead rapper with a cult followin'
Legions of fans got their hands on my old jams
And new fans, they were sayin' ""Oh damn!""
At every punchline, and now the rumors break and hit
Cause everybody knew that I was workin' on some new shit
Cats askin', ""Who's on it?  Who produced it?""
Straight up, just ask deceased, let the man {""rest in peace""}
All my old friends are now sayin' that's a spiritual
My mother wants my material
Girlfriends sayin' that I'm lyrical, fightin' over rights
Sellin' R.I.P. t-shirts at open mics
Fans thought the East/West was comin' to South
Got the Source van in front of my house
XXL and Elemental runnin' their mouth
Got my dad depressed, he's bout to flip, put a gun in his mouth

[Chorus:]

Now majors havin' bidding wars, and deals on the table
Labels unstable cause my face is on cable
Even underground critics say that I'm the best that did it
Even though they shitted on my last hit-it
I don't get it, Sony pimped me up in a week
And now my accapella's flowin' over wack commercial beats
They shot my video, with an Esoteric stunt double
In a Lex bubble, sayin' it was footage from the night before the trouble
No red tape, just sample clearances and mad guest appearances
(Like who?) A lot of guys whom I never authorized
As my mother looks into the skies to apologize
Although I'm dead mom, my soul remains undaunted
Now you can actually afford the things you wish you flaunted
And even though every studio will be haunted
I finally got the major label budget that I wanted

We gon' do some things right now

I'm 'bout to make the scene mine
I got a tea party, baby meet me on the Green Line
Ain't too many kids that flow better than me
Roll thick like Yassir sideburns in seventy-three

Like Tom Brady and the Pats, we rollin' kids
Cross me and pay a toll like the Tobin Bridge
From the home of the curse, y'all know what I mean
We like the left field wall, we stackin' monster Green

Knock you out of the park, you land on Yawkey Way

6-1-7, 9-7-8, 7-8-1, 5-0-8, and 4-1-3
And I don't mean to brag, but it's in the bag
And we alone on top like we goin' stag
It's a dynasty, that's how I see things
In four years we countin' three rings
I'm the MVP, baby gimme that key ring
And me, Brady and Branch'll own our sweet thing

Yeah, and we ain't gon' stop
We at the Eagle, cook 'em all as they flop
And T.O. takin' on the be roll and that's the past
Beatin' everybody and the salary cap

What now? You say titan's your rep
That's like Peyton winning big games out on Gillette
We don't forget y'all, we're keepin' it grimy
Had the Steel Curtain lookin' like venetian blinds
Yeah baby, that's how it go
That's why next year, it's lookin' like 3 in a row

Yeah, uhh
It's Esoteric, tunin' in
Puttin' it down, for Boston Mass
Yo, I rep the Bean, y'all see the way it be
Home of Source magazine, the Pats and Edo. G
Steadily, poetically I'm Bill Russell in command
Peace to Dorcester, Roxbury, Mattapan
Pack a man down quick like neanderthals
Standin' tall after brawlin' up in Fanueil Hall
As a young buck moms said I disobey
All she heard was Nomah like fans in Fenway

But they sent him to the dugs, I'm like Manny when he shrugs
And it bugs me to see the women wearin' [unknown] in the club
A deadly combination like venom hit your blood
Jason Varitek with the glove, it's all love
I'm like Schilling with the red sock, when I get hot
My aim is dangerous, like the Larry Bird set shot

Do you forget me 
Do you exclude my name 
When you narrate your life to all your newfound friends 
But I am creeping up on you 
Keeping an eye on what you do 
Baby there is gonna be 
No more playing games with me 
You should not be 
Messing with me 
Try me and you will see 
Baby don't be 
Messing with me 
I can't wait to make you see 
Give me your money 
Give me your peace of mind 
Just give me something in return for what you stole 
I'm cut but not bleeding 
Scarred but not torn apart 
I just need something kinda strong to fill the hole 
Well you can change your haircut change your name 
I am gonna find you all the same 
Baby there is gonna be 
No more getting smart with me 
You should not be 
Messing with me 
Try me and you will see 
I want to know 
Where do you go 
And where is that leaving me 
Never thought I'd get to see 
The jealousy livin' inside of me 
You should not be 
Messing with me 
Try me and you will see 
Baby don't be 
Messing with me 
I can't wait to make you see 
You should not be 
Messing with me 
Try me and you will see 
I want to know 
Where do you go 
And where the hell is that leaving me",Messing With Me,1997

What if I told you I'm prepared to make that sacrifice

If I told you that I've loved you from the first sight
Would you believe me for I swear I tell no lie
What if I told you that just last night

Where mister when you're young 
They bring you up to do like your daddy done 
Me and Mary we met in high school 
When she was just seventeen 
We'd ride out of this valley down to where the fields were green 

We'd go down to the river 
And into the river we'd dive 
Oh down to the river we'd ride 

Then I got Mary pregnant 
And man that was all she wrote 
And for my nineteenth birthday I got a union card and a wedding coat 
We went down to the courthouse 
And the judge put it all to rest 
No wedding day smiles no walk down the aisle 
No flowers no wedding dress 

That night we went down to the river 
And into the river we'd dive 
Oh down to the river we did ride 

I got a job working construction for the Johnstown Company 
But lately there ain't been much work on account of the economy 
Now all them things that seemed so important 
Well mister they vanished right into the air 
Now I just act like I don't remember 
Mary acts like she don't care 

But I remember us riding in my brother's car 
Her body tan and wet down at the reservoir 
At night on them banks I'd lie awake 
And pull her close just to feel each breath she'd take 
Now those memories come back to haunt me 
They haunt me like a curse 
Is a dream a lie if it don't come true 
Or is it something worse 
That sends me down to the river 
Though I know the river is dry 
That sends me down to the river tonight 
Down to the river 
My baby and I 
Oh down to the river we ride",The River,2006
Espen Lind,"I have always been the type to think before I speak
I have always been the type to look before I leap
And like a bolt out of the blue I was struck and there was you
For a moment I believed that I could let go

You lift me up into the sky
Felt like I could fly
Never gonna die
N' I almost made it but not quite
Now you're flying out of sight
And you know I can't come with you
I'll always be scared of heights
Always be scared of heights

I didn't think I'd meet someone who'd make me change my ways
Never thought I'd find someone who'd brighten up my days
Someone who made me forget
My hands were tied
My wings were clipped
Someone who made me believe that I could let go

You lift me up into the sky
I felt like I could fly
I was never gonna die
N' I almost made it but not quite
You're flying out of sight
And you know I can't come with you
'cause I'll always be scared of heights
Scared of heights

Wish I never knew how great it feels up in the air
Wish I never got to feel the wind blow through my hair
Well, in my dreams you'll always be flying high along with me
And in my dreams I'll always feel that I can let go

You lift me up into the sky
I feel like I can fly
I'm never gonna die
N' I almost made it but not quite
Now you're flying out of sight
And now I can't come with you
'cause I'll always be scared of heights

Her branches cradle slipping,
Buds, yawning open,
Welcome by an aging man

With memories of when
Her bows were arms that held him as a younger man
Together, they would marvel at
The birth of spring time

Now he stands beneath the apple blossoms
Every year where they used to go walking
And he tells her about the summer and the autumn,
The winter in his heart,
And their apple blossoms

In summer they would dream
Of being three and smile,
Imagining how round,
As the apples on the ground
That fall, they loved and waited

But winter came too soon
Before their seed could bloom
She wilted from the chill
And all fell cold and still

Now he stands beneath the apple blossoms
Every year where they use to go walking
And he tells her about the summer and the autumn,
The winter in his heart,
And their apple blossoms

As he opened the after, as she fell 
He prayed heaven would be waiting to meet her
He kisses her cold cheek goodbye,
But he couldn't surrender the hope of staying silent
So in her fallen hands he placed a seed from their favorite tree
And he laid her to rest beneath the blanket of white
'Till they'd meet again in the spring time

Esperanza Spalding,"She's in danger, too
Human danger
Lone canary nesting near a runway whispers
Earthly strangers
Mighty jet planes fly you casually glancing
O'er seas and mountains
Too high to see this dying bird singing her swan song
No one hears it through the din as engines burn
Stars across the sky
Watch the caveman fly
Taking in the sights
Breathing out things die
Mother nature
Dying to reach you hasn't heard from you in
Ages since when her young children
Listened to her songs with awe and reverence
Now adolescents growing fast and eating her heart
No more thank you's no good mornings
Earthly dangers
What was once your modest home now
Swarms with cars and poison
Brown skies noise and playing with toys that kill you family
Blowing up the mountains foul oil fountains
Watch the caveman burn through the sky
The last canary screams her final song and dies while
Towards her nest crawl more sprawling towns
What burns up must come down
Human nature
Scrambling late to curb hard consequences
Young mankind so much potential
Time to heed Earth's guidance
Though our science brought us to novel heights
We must come back to mother
First she'll ground us the she'll whisper
You were my most endangered species

For in the night time silent I recite thousands of poems about you
Until one of them comes true

In my memories the breath of life baptizes me through
Till the air is clear enough to breathe around you
I'll keep holding on

Such a thrill when you're near
But a staggering feat
Holding still when I feel
I can hear my heartbeat, your love may never flow my way
Still I'm gonna keep holding on

Shouldn't I just let go
Since there's nothing left to do
Time just melts away and the current grows stronger
Pulling me downstream toward you
But until my love runs dry

We've been finding insight in what we knew to be right from the day we were born

We were silent before, but we're not anymore, now we'll even the score
We'll describe and dissect every secret effect that lay hid behind doors
There was time in the past to describe or outlast all that cluttered and cast
A dispirting light through our shallowing nights soon will never be right",Riding,2004

Aand likewise a silk hankerchief to tie up his hair
To tie up his hair as sailors will do,
""And third my pretty Polly, will you come too?""

Now this may seem young and foolish, she thought it no harm
To lie on the bed to keep herself warm
And what was done there, I shall never disclose
But I wish that short night had been seven long years

And into my pockets 3 guineas did throw
Saying""Tthis I will give and more I will do
If you'll be my Polly wherever I go""

And if it's a girl she'll wear a gold ring
