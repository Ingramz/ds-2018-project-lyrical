Alice Fearn,"There's a place for us, somewhere a place for us
Peace and quiet and open air, wait for us somewhere

There's a time for us, someday a time for us
Time together with time to spare, time to learn, time to care

Someday, somewhere, we'll find a new way of living
We'll find a way of forgiving, somewhere

There's a place for us, a time and place for us
Hold my hand and we're half-way there, hold my hand and I'll take you there

Somehow, someday, somewhere",Somewhere,2007
Alice Gerrard,"Well I tried to be the kind of woman you wanted me to be
And it's not your fault that I tried to be what I thought you wanted to see
Smilin' face shinnin' hair clothes that I thought you'd like me to wear
Made to please and not to tease it's the custom made woman blues.

Yes I tried to be the kind of woman you wanted me to be
And I tried to see life your way and say all the things you'd like me to say
Lovin' looks gentle hands an guaranteed to keep a' holdin' your man
Made to please and not to tease it's the custom made woman blues.

And now you say you're tired of me and all of those things I thought you wanted me to be
Is it true you want some one who knows how to think and do on her own
Lord it's hard to realize the lessons I learned so was young were nothing but lies
Made to please and not to tease it's the custom made woman blues
Made to please and not to tease it's the custom made woman blues.

",Custom Made Woman Blues,1973
Alice Gerrard,"You pull the string
She's your plaything
You can make her or break her, it's true
You abuse her, accuse her
Turn her round and use her
Then forsake her any time it suits you

There's more to her than powder and paint
Than her peroxided bleached-out hair
And if she acts that way
It's 'cause you've had your day
Don't put her down, you helped put her there

She hangs around
Playing her clown
While her soul is aching inside
She's heartbreak's child
She just lives for your smile
To build her up in a world made by man

There's more to her than powder and paint
Than her peroxided bleached-out hair
And if she acts that way
It's 'cause you've had your day
Don't put her down, you helped put her there

At the house down the way
You sneak and you pay
For her love, her body or her shame
Then you call yourself a man
And say you just don't understand
How a woman could turn out that way

There's more to her than powder and paint
The men she picks up at the bar
And if she acts that way
It's 'cause you've had your day
Don't put her down, you helped put her there

And if she acts that way
It's 'cause you've had your day
Don't put her down, you helped put her there

Alice Gerrard,"Oh the green rolling hills of West Virginia
   Are the nearest thing to heaven that I know
   Though the times are sad and drear and I cannot linger here
   They'll keep me and never let me go.

My daddy said don't ever be a miner
or a miner's grave is all you'll ever own
There's hard times everywhere I can't find a dime to spare
These are the worst times I've ever known

So I'll move away into some crowded city
In some northern factory town you'll find me there
Though I'll leave the past behind 'll never change my mind
These troubled times are more than I can bear.

Someday I'll go back to West Virginia
To those green rolling hills I love so well
Oh someday I'll go home and I know I'll right the wrong
And these hard times will follow me no more.",The Green Rolling Hills of West Virginia,1973
Alice Gerrard," Now you're back on my doorstep a' crying
   Like I cried through all those lonely years
   But I can't dry your tears it's been too long since love was here
   And I've already gave you my better years

And so the pages of time kept right on turning
They never stopped for us to harvest the years
And old embers of love kept right on dying
For there was no one to drown my tears.

But I've tried not to blame you
and I try not to shame you
All I can do now is wish you well
But if you should need a friend
I'll be there until the end
Just don't ask me to love you again.

   And don't come back to my doorstep a' crying
   Hoping for what's been dead so long
   For the embers have all turned to ashes
   There's nothing here but old memories and this song.

   No don't come back to my doorstep a' crying
   There's nothing here but old memories and this song.
",My Better Years,1973
Alice Gerrard,"Fly away little pretty bird
Fly Fly away 
Fly away little pretty bird
And pretty you'll always stay

I see in your eyes a promise
Your own tender love you bring
But fly away little pretty bird
Close    the spring

Loves own tender flame warms this meeting
And loves tender song should sing
But fly away little pretty bird
And pretty you'll always stay

I cannot make you no promise
For love is such a daily good thing
Fly away little pretty bird
For he'd only clip your wings

Fly away little pretty bird
And pretty you'd always stay
Fly far beyond the dark mountain
To where you'll be free ever more

Fly away little pretty bird
Where the cold winter winds don't blow

But I can sure remember where I come from.

Alice Gerrard,"Hey I got the early Monday morning working blues
I put on my worn out working shoes
Well the weekend was too short but I can choose
When the lord made the working girl, he made the blues

Well I'm tired of working my life way
And givin someone else all of my pay
While they get rich on the profits that I lose
And leaving me here with the working girl blues

I do oh lay eee Working Girl Blues!
And I can't even afford a new pair of shoes
While they can live in any penthouse they choose
And all I got is the working girl blues

My boss said a raise is due almost any day
But I wonder will my hair be all turned gray
Before he turns that dollar loose and I get my dues
And lose a little bit of these working girl blues

Well I'm tired of working my life way

Alice Gerrard,"Ten years ago
On a cold dark night
Someone was killed
'Neath the Town Hall light

Few were at the scene
But they all did agree
The slayer who ran
Looked a lot like me

The judge said, ""son
What is your alibi?
If you were somewhere else
You won't have to die""

Well I spoke not a word
Although it meant my life
For I had been in the arms
Of my best friend's wife

She walks these hills
In a long black veil
She visits my grave
When the night winds wail

Nobody knows, nobody sees
Nobody knows but me

The scaffold was high
And eternity near
She stood in the crowd
And shed not a tear

But sometimes at night
When the cold wind moans
In a long black veil
She cries o'er my bones

She walks these hills
In a long black veil
She visits my grave
When the night winds wail

Nobody knows, nobody sees
Nobody knows but me

Nobody knows, nobody sees
Nobody knows but me",Long Black Veil,1996
Alice Gerrard,"I hate to see that evening sun go down
I hate to see that evening sun go down
Cause my baby, he's gone left this town

Feelin' tomorrow like I feel today
If I'm feelin' tomorrow like I feel today
I'll pack my truck and make my give-a-way

St. Louis woman with her diamond ring
Pulls that man around by her, if it wasn't for her and her
That man I love would have gone nowhere, nowhere

I got the St. Louis blues, blues as I can be
That man's got a heart like a rock cast in the sea
Or else he wouldn't have gone so far from me

I love my baby like a school boy loves his pie
Like a Kentucky colonel loves his mint 'n rye
I love my man till the day I die",St. Louis Blues,2008

Alice Gold,"If I were you I wouldn't be stronger
I can see you're strong all the time
It only takes a little bit longer
To figure out the feelings inside
To figure out the meaning but life hasn't got a purpose
And it all gets out of focus
So when it feels hopeless

Cry baby cry cry cry
Your beautiful blue eyes better
Cry cry cry
And you can leave it all behind let the
Tears run dry
I will hold you and the world won't see
Don't you know you're beautiful to me
So beautiful

Yeah our own worst enemy's right here
Looking in the mirror at you
He's saying why do you persevere
Laying on the pressure as we do
I want to make it lesser when the reasons run around you oh
The more that you suppress it high treason comes to find you
Every warrior finds the time to
So close that door behind you

Cry baby cry cry cry
Your beautiful blue eyes better
Cry cry cry
Let it go tonight let the
Tears run dry
I will hold you so the world won't see
I hope you know you're beautiful to me
So beautiful

And suddenly the rain has drifted out to see
Harboring the pain got the better of me
Can you feel the love again, letting it go is just letting it be it's the way that it's got to be

Cry baby cry cry cry
Your beautiful blue eyes better

Or something to regret
'Cause your memory is one that I just can't forget

I check the rear view mirror and there you are

I'm happy were I am with the choices I've made
But sometimes I can feel you like you're next to me

Like fields of forever

I don't know if at seventeen

You can ever see beyond the dream
Or the beat of your heart
Flush in your face, it had to be true
Like the love with the boy in the backseat I knew

After graduation we went our separate ways
I flew off to college, you just drove away
With plans of traveling this great big world of ours
And throughout the years I'd see your eyes
On strangers faces, on other guys
From small cafes to dark Midwestern bars

But the boy in the backseat had miles to go
From the isle of Antigua to the Vancouver coast
Every now and then a postcard home
Friends say you're married, all I know

Is the beat of my heart
Flush in my face
It had to be true
Like the love with the boy in the backseat I knew

Everyone you ever love is a part of you

And the boy in the backseat with eyes of green
Like fields of forever do you know what I mean
In the rose colored world of seventeen
Real life can never touch that dream

And the boy in the backseat won't ever change
Time passes by, the radio plays
On that lost and misty lover's lane

The sound of the night, the sound of the rain
And the beat of your heart
Flush in your face, it had to be true

Only ten years old, makes my blood run cold,
And the press descends like birds of prey.

Lobbied, bought and sold, trading votes for gold,
They've forgotten that they work for us.

On a moonless light with your flashlight

How you knew me when I was a girl
All mixed up about the world

We're so alike in many ways

On the couch in your front porch

But not my love for you, I'll keep that close and near.
Some things just fade like scars and dreams,

You said you'd realized in life that chances pass you by,
And what you thought was yours, slowly fades before your eyes.
And part of growin' up, is that you can't go back in time.
You have to live with your regrets, the things you leave behind.
And we agreed to be the best of friends.

Where was your mother?
Where is the honor in hurting a child?

In Time
And all across the universe
Everything expanding

A beginning and an ending
I don't know the mystery
Of why we're here or how we came to be

That everyone should be the same
I know who I am
Don't need your philosophy
It isn't any use to me
I know where I stand
In the ways of life and art
I trust the wisdom of my heart
I may stumble, I may fall
But I know that through it all
If to my own self I am true
Than I'm sure to make it through
It doesn't matter what you say
'Cause I know I'll be okay
I know who I am
I may not be your fantasy
Or what you think I'm 'sposed to be
Well I understand
But what you clearly fail to see
Is there's nobody else quite like me
In this wonderland
My luck begins with these two hands
'Cause nothing happens just by chance

Oh, think of how you once clung to her knee,

When you're in doubt, you can cling to me.
Cling to me, cling to me, cling to me, cling to me,
You can cling to me.

If through a lot of 'follery', you lost your last red cent,
I wouldn't even stop to ask you why, to ask you why,
I'll pawn my mother's jewelry, I'll steal my sister's rent,
It's all for you, kid, you can milk me dry.
You can milk me dry, you can milk me dry,

But tonight we'll be free, all the promises'll be broken

There were ghosts in the eyes of all the boys you sent away
They haunt this dusty beach road in the skeleton frames of burned-out Chevrolets
They scream your name at night in the street
Your graduation gown lies in rags at their feet

You hear their engines rolling on

I saw the white snow turn to dust.

We had it cast upon the human race.
I heard the future from afar.
We heard the past, from a distant star.
I saw the patterns in the sky.

I saw the people change to cope.
We saw a distant space of love and hope.

Afraid to look behind me
But I will

They say that you are the only one

Alice Russell,"Citizens of planet earth don't get caught in the act
Don't strive to destruction the flash it's just that
There's something behind these walls, something under the sheets, I stay
A truth that's been locked in way down in me

You've got to get up, around your space
And take a, take a little time to contemplate
Will we ever see what it's like behind these walls
And are you, are you still moving up every time you fall, stop

Think a little about what you got
Stop, think a little about what you got
And start again

I could be you, you
And you, you
You could be me, me
And I, I, I could be you, you
And you, you
You could be me, me

I could be you, you
And you, you

We dance, we breathe for, we may change and all it is
Remember that we are what we are and all we are
We dance, we breathe for, we may change and all it is

So in the answer lies the question
The subject that we started all along
My mind didn't feel so open
Imagination filling up my soul

So we don't know what we doing
We do know that's what we should believe
But it makes no difference of what you see inside

So don't you see you're not so different
Take yourself back to innocence
Don't you see you're not so different
Take yourself back to innocence

Don't know where you're coming
Don't know where you're going too
You can't tie down an angel
A picture of life it's true

When rain drops come and go
The different never hide
Where you lose yourself
You find your mind

So don't you see you're not so different
Take yourself back to innocence
Don't you see you're not so different
Take yourself back to innocence

So don't you see you're not so different
Take yourself back to innocence

Twice and twice again

But you're all the way my heart

Then I slip and tumble

So don't you serve it up

If you were me for a while

'Cause you are sad inside
If you were me for a while
Maybe you'd think about it
More, and realize

And now your feet are under the table
Chew my mind up caught you asleep
But is it ever meant to be rough
In time, upon the crest of a wave

Big wave, big sharks, big as your fingers
Won't sit and spill to the next
Let's get down quiet on the moment
Inside you beat it, boy and before

We find ourselves back again
And eat us up, 3012
But I am not a preacher
So no I won't serve it up

I so love you
It's dead inside
It's on, my heart
And I, I'm sending
Out for more high
Always comes to the
Same we started at the bottom
So let's meet at the top my friend
It's no use sending, pretending that
If anyone else would ever come close to you

We will watch others fall

And tell me can one ever save another

Remember, then a broken heart is what you get

It's a red beaded knuckle but it's keeping us alive
Each day we always struggle with the thought of what's inside
Today's simple kisses, will be loaded with regret

When it falls, when it breaks
Who spills right open
When it falls, when it breaks
Smash it to the ground
When it falls, when it breaks
The landscape all for love escape
When it falls, when it breaks
Huuuu
When it falls, when it breaks

When we were young
With wild hearts
And wild souls
Beneath the dreams
An open sea
A life for miles
Stretched out before

I miss your voice
And how it felt
We had it whole
With wild souls
You were away
Across the sea
You left a cry

But now I know
How it feels when it's cold
As the winter rose in to your heart
And the tears row with words
Don't you long for the start
Long for the start

I loved you
Hanging on to these words I feel you let me by
I feel you
Hanging on to these words I feel you

So looking back
You went this way
Got caught in the wind
That blue way
But while its souls
Tell fruit for tales
A city's long

So now I know
How it feels when it's cold
As the winter rose in to your heart
And the tears row with words
Don't you long for the start

My dear (It's not, cause it's not)
What you really want girl
My heart's not sprung in love when I see you (when I see you, when I see you)
I try to play it cool because (Like you, I really like you)
You're so special to me, to me
To me, to me (Let's go)
Let's move to California
Right now (pack your bags, go pack your bags)
I have things on my back so please don't (take the blame, I have to take the blame)
Girl, I know you ready, I can see it in your eyes
Boy, I know you're not, I can tell you're terrified
Nobody has to know and if they did, they wouldn't care
When you rub my hands switching fifth gear
Forget about it baby, let's not waste our afternoon (forget about it baby)
Cause we're gonna go fly to the moon (I wanna go fly to the moon)
Yeah, but anyway (Pack your bags, pack your bags)
Play it cool, play it cool, cause it's cold (Play it cool, play it cool)
You're so special to me, to me
To me, to me

(Don't you wanna go back)
(Let's go, let's go)
(Right now)
I think I believe you (Let me show you how girl)
It's nice that I need to
The earth is so rough I'm not calling your bluff, what, what, what (she would love that)
I think I believe you
Take me higher
Let's make our way over
To the Okaga cave
Today (today)
There we will stay, play it cool now
X-Y-Z how?
Welcome me in
Then we'll begin

Suckin' on my ears, fingers
Rubbing through your hair
Fastwind, slowwind, fuck yeah, we behaving bad, uh
Probably couldn't tell but I be blushing when you with me
When you kiss me, swear to God, blood was rushing to my chimney
Laying on my trampoline, looking at the stars
From my fake space fog machine
Now you know my arm is dead
From the push that you had
I said I loved you, said it back
Like it was scripted, instrumented, like the flavor of that lemonade
That we was sippin on our sushi-ridden dinner date
Oh, you think you special now?
Other bitches trippin' now
Cause we're fleeing to the moon
Fuck Earth, man we sick of y'all
Wings on my backs and we ain't gotta cop a ticket, nah, nah, nah

Oh yeah
Oh yeah, let's go to the moon!
(Watch this) Let's go to the moon!
(Favorite director)
(Gonna be good)
Come on, baby
What you wanna do?
(I really like you)

Take me away
Fuck what they say

Another day
We in outer space
We'll waste our days

Alice Stuart,"Frankie and Johnny were sweethearts
Lordy, how they could love
Swore to be true to each other
Yeah, true to the skies above
He was her man, wouldn't do her no wrong

And Frankie and Johnny went walkin'
And Johnny had on a new suit
Yeah, Frankie spent one-hundred dollar notes
Just to make her man look cute
He was her man, he wouldn't do her no wrong

Frankie went over to the barroom
Stopped for a bottle of beer
Said to the old bartender man
""Has my lover Johnny man been here?""
""He was my man, Lord, but he'd been doin' me wrong, so wrong.""

Yeah, Frankie looked over the transom door
And there to her great surprise
There sat her lover man Johnny
Makin' love to Nellie Bly
He was her man, but he was doin' her wrong

Well, Frankie lifted up her kimono dress
And she drew (ladaladalala) out a little .44
She shot once, twice, three times (three times) she shot him
And through that hardwood (door) floor
Yeah, she shot her man (yeah he was her man)
Well, but he been doin' her wrong yeah

He said,"" roll me over so careful ah
Roll me over so slow,
Oh roll me off to my left hand side,
Because your bullet hurt me so,
I was your man, but I been doin' you wrong.""

Play it Chris!

(Instrumental & trombone & guitar solo)

Well, they sent for Frankie's mother
Come down to Huddie's saloon
To see what's the matter with her boy
She come down, Frankie looked up at her
Here what she said:

She said, ""Oh Mrs. Johnson, oh forgive me please
Well I killed your lovin' son, Johnny
But I'm down on my bended knee
I shot your man, 'cause he was doin' me wrong ah'.

She said, ""I'll forgive you Frankie,
She said, I'll forgive you not, not
For killin' lovin' son Johnny,
He's the only support that I've got,
'Lord, you shot my man and he was doin' you wrong.""

Well, the last time I seen Frankie
She was a-sittin' in a dungeon cell
She would be there lonely, herself
With no one there to care
She shot her man, a-he'd been doin' her wrong, so wrong

Well, bring out the rubber tired (hearse) so long
You gotta bring out your pony and trap
Yeah, they're gonna take Johnny, Johnny to the cemetery (graveyard)
And he ain't never coming back
Well, he was her man
Oh, but he been doin' her wrong, so wrong

Well, the story ain't got no moral, Lordy
But the story ain't got no end
Well, the story only goes to show
That there ain't no damn good in men!
She shot her man (he was her man)
But he was doin' her wrong

Yeah, ba-da-ba-ba-da-ba-ba-da-ba-ba-ba-ba.

Woo!
Thank you very much.

Alice Stuart,"Gee, but it's hard to love someone when that someone don't love you! 
I'm so disgusted, heart-broken, too; I've got those down-hearted blues; 
Once I was crazy 'bout a man; he mistreated me all the time, 
The next man I get has got to promise me to be mine, all mine! 

Trouble, trouble, I've had it all my days, 
Trouble, trouble, I've had it all my days; 
It seems like trouble going to follow me to my grave. 

I ain't never loved but three mens in my life; 
I ain't never loved but three men in my life: 
My father, my brother, the man that wrecked my life. 

It may be a week, it may be a month or two, 
It may be a week, it may be a month or two, 
But the day you quit me, honey, troubles comin' home to you. 

I got the world in a jug, the stopper's in my hand,

Only one I could have a problem with is myself
That's probably why my only competition is myself

I got the street on lock
I'm on automatic pilot, ain't nobody starting me
Growing up in poverty ain't fill my heart with larceny
Niggas ride, I don't hide, I dump to get 'em off of me
I'm a leader, look and see the natural born boss of me
They from Bel Air, I'm from the bottom
Soon as I spot 'em I get to drop 'em
I got 'em the competition, red-dot 'em

It's off with the chain, off with the ring

Shootin' niggas down if they clothes is tacky
Get an 18 or brick and my clothes is khaki
And the Porsche got a glass roof
The blunt got a live purple haze in it, little bit of hash too
See me when I pass through, fuck around and I'ma blast you
Do what I have to, tryin' to get my math too
I leave a message, ain't a phone I use
I call my niggas, bat 'em down, they bones I bruise

Earlier this year I buried my queen in a gold casket
Your mother's the closest thing to
God that you ever have kid I'm askin, what would you do at your own mom's funeral
Want to pick her up out of it, this can't be real
Tellin' my daughter grandma's gone, but
I can't keep still I can't go on, responsible for so many
Her last days at the hospital
Visits from family I'm tryin' not to bust shots at niggas
Wishin' death on other nigga's mothers ain't right but why mommy
She raised me in the projects alone
Her untimely exit from her, heavenly body
Got me ready to embody somethin' quickly
Can't be happy, fuck a party she can't party with me
So your apologies are burnin' ya own souls
To the kids with no parents at home, grab a whole 

[Chorus 2: Alicia Keys]
This is the song, for my warriors
A warrior song
Bravehearted and strong, definition of a warrior
(Uh, warriors)
Gonna keep marchin' on, to the sound of her own beatin' drum 

[Nas]
Fight 'til the fight is over, for my peoples I die see
When you thought they were soldiers they turned out to be nobodies
I think they out to get me, helpless was livin' sinful If you was me
All this pain I'm feelin would bend and killed you
(I'm a Warrior)
It only made me stronger
But in my head it gets darker who wishin' evil on ya
Sometimes I wish I was dead
But I took heed to the cause
(I'm a Warrior, yeah)
'Cause I been high I been low, searchin' for a way to go
Every single night I pray
And Lord I'm on this battleground, lost just waitin' to be found I guess it's just a warrior's way 

[Chorus 1: x3]

[Nas]
To my warriors
To all these, baby Krucial
Keys! Braveheart y'all
This to all my warriors, who breathe with the heart of a lion
To everybody that lost their mother, their father
Rest in peace moms!
My mother's last words:
Never give up
A true warrior, who raised me in the hood, in a war
Love ya girl, why'kno keep marchin'
Yea yea yea, you never give up
To all my warriors, haha

If you wanted the moonlight, I'd give you that too

And there's no hesitation
When you want me, honey, just call me

And honey, you're my inspiration

When I'm in your arms, when you squeeze me

And the sky would be blue
As long as you're lovin' me

Dreamin' bout you 
I keep dreamin' 'bout you
When I'm dreamin' 'bout when you would say

[Chorus]

Dreamin' bout you 
I keep dreamin' bout you
When I'm dreamin and waiting for the day
When no one and nothing else takes up our time
Finally you're only mine

Each and everyday
I don't walk with you right by my side
But instead we have to hide
Sneak around and lie 
Just to spend time alone
This lovin is a crime 
I'd rather do the time
And leave the world behind

[Chorus]

Let's get away 
Let's get away
Oh oh

We can get away 
We can get away
Oh oh

Let's get away 
Let's get away
Oh oh

We can get away 
We can get away

Alicia Keys,"Childhood living is easy to do 
The things you wanted I bought them for you 
Graceless lady you know who I am 
You know I can't let you slide through my hands 

Wild horses couldn't drag me away 
Wild, wild horses, couldn't drag me away 

I watched you suffer a dull aching pain 
Now you decided to show me the same 
No sweeping exits or offstage lines 
Could make me feel bitter or treat you unkind 

Wild horses couldn't drag me away 
Wild, wild horses, couldn't drag me away 

I know I dreamed you a sin and a lie 
I have my freedom but I don't have much time 
Faith has been broken, tears must be cried 
Let's do some living before we die 

Wild horses couldn't drag me away 
Wild, wild horses, we'll ride them some day 

Wild horses couldn't drag me away

Alicia Keys,"You could buy me diamonds
You could buy me pearls
Take me on a cruise around the world
Baby you know I'm worth it
Dinner lit by candles
Run my bubble bath
Make love tenderly to last, to last
Cause baby you know I'm worth it

Wanna please wanna keep wanna treat your woman right
Not just dough but to show that you know she is worth your time
You will lose if you chose to refuse to put her first
She will if she can find a man who knows her worth

Cause a real man, knows a real woman when he sees her
And a real woman knows a real man ain't afraid to please her
And a real woman knows a real man always comes first
And a real man just can't deny a woman's worth

If you treat me fairly
I'll give you all my goods
Treat you like a real woman should
Baby I know you're worth it
If you never play me
Promise not to bluff
I'll hold you down when shit gets rough
Cause baby I know you're worth it

She walks the mile makes you smile all the while being true
Don't take for granted the passions that she has for you
You will lose if you chose to refuse to put her first
She will if she can find a man who knows her worth

Cause a real man, knows a real woman when he sees her
And a real woman knows a real man ain't afraid to please her
And a real woman knows a real man always comes first
And a real man just can't deny a woman's worth

No need to read between the lines spelled out for you (spelled out for you)
Just hear this song cause you can't go wrong when you value (better value)
A woman's (woman's)
Woman's (woman's)
Worth!

And you're the girl

Why I should play 
Yeah you hurt me

The loneliness you give me
I just can't go

And how you need you're space and give the keys back to your door.
And how i cried and tried and tried to make you stay with me.
And still you said your love was gone and that i had to leave.
Now your talkin bout a family.
Now your sayin you complete my dreams.
Oh
Now your sayin I'm your everything
Your confusing me
what you sayin me don't play with me' don't play with me cause

What goes around comes around,
What goes up must come down
Now who's cryin desiring to come back to me
What goes around comes around,
what goes up must come down.
Now who's cryin desiring to come back to me

I remember when I was sittin home alone
Waitin for you til 3 o'clock in the ‘morn
And when you came home you'd always have some sorry excuse
Half explaining to me like I'm just some kind of a fool
I sacrificed the things I wanted just to do things for you
But when it's time to do for me
You never come thru
Now you wanna be up under me
Now you have so much to say to me
Now you wanna make time for me
Whatcha doin to me, you're confusin me
Don't play with me don't play with me cause

What goes around comes around
What goes up must come down
Now who's cryin', desiring to come back to me
What goes around comes around
What goes up must come down
Now who's cryin, desiring to come back

I remember when I was sittin home alone
Waitin for you till 3 o'clock in the ‘morn
Night after night knowing something goin on
Wasn't long before I be gone
Lord knows it wasn't easy believe me
Never thought you'd be the one that would deceive me
And never do what you're supposed to do
No need to approach me fool, cuz I'm over you

What goes around comes around
What goes up must come down
Now who's cryin', desiring to come back to me
What goes around comes around
What goes up must come down
Gotta stop trying to come back to me

Alicia Keys,"Here I am, here we are
As it will go on forever
Noise, always noise
Candles burn, lights are low
I haven't a place to go

Life in it's constant state of moving nowhere
The music is nice, floats through the air
Sounds of waves crashing everywhere
Percussive submissions, mind conditions
Writing with the left hand
Unknowing and taking the chance

Why not fly? Why not try?
This constant game I play to stay high
But all is just a state of mind
All is reality of your choice
Constant evolution, constant adaptation
Constant state of moving nowhere

Footsteps, silence is loud
Kindness is brave, wisdom is long
Loving is necessary, I need it, we need it
Searching, looking for the satisfaction
It is nowhere, it is everywhere

Preaching, pleading, praying for God to come
What are we waiting for?
Why are we so afraid of taking charge?
But it's always changing, always
In the constant state of going nowhere

We all have demons to battle, roads to walk
Crosses to bear, mistakes and sins
Candles and their steady glow
Water and its constant crash

Endless horizon, rocks of times long gone
Still strong, still here and so are we
Here we are forever
The constant state of going nowhere

The constant state of going nowhere
Constant state of going nowhere
Con-con-constant state of moving nowhere
Constant state of moving nowhere

It's like a jungle
It's like a jungle

It's like a jungle out here, so much struggle out here
And my dreams steal my rest, sleep's the cousin of death
Always feels like a race against father time
In the streets of New York

All I see is street hoes, and bullet holes in my people
Only crime fills the brain, feels like I'm going insane
The revolution has to start, don't waste no time

Big dreams in my head empty my tummy 
Might crack a smile but ain't nothin funny

Everywhere I go and there was some part of me
Thirteen thirteen was, hookers and hoes 
On 11th avenue sellin bodies for dope (Whoa)

Gonna make it someday gotta be somebody 
Say, mommy don't worry it's just you and me 
But, one day we will get out of this misery (Hey!)

Alicia Keys,"Yea, yea I'm out that Brooklyn, now I'm down in Tribeca
Right next to DeNiro, but I'll be hood forever
I'm the new Sinatra, and, since I made it here
I can make it anywhere, yea, they love me everywhere I used to cop in Harlem,
All of my Dominicano's right there up on Broadway,
Pull me back to that McDonald's, took it to my stashbox, 560 State St.
Catch me in the kitchen like a Simmons wippin' pastry's
Cruisin' down 8th St., off white Lexus
Drivin' so slow, but BK is from Texas
Me, I'm out that Bed-Stuy, home of that boy Biggie
Now I live on Billboard and I brought my boys with me
Say whattup to Ty-Ty, still sippin' Mai Tai's
Sittin' courtside, Knicks and Nets give me high five
Nigga I be Spike'd out, I could trip a referee
Tell by my attitude that I'm most definitely from

In New York,
Concrete jungle where dreams are made of
There's nothin' you can't do

These streets will make you feel brand new
Big lights will inspire you

Catch me at the X with OG at a Yankee game
Shit, I made the Yankee hat more famous then a Yankee can
You should know I bleed blue, but I ain't a Crip though
But I got a gang of niggas walkin' with my clique though
Welcome to the melting pot, corners where we sellin' rock
Afrika Bambataa shit, home of the hip-hop
Yellow cab, gypsy cab, dollar cab, holla back
For foreigners it ain't for, they act like they forgot how to act
Eight million stories, out there in it naked
City is a pity, half of y'all won't make it
Me, I got a plug, Special Ed ""I Got It Made""
If Jesus payin' Lebron, I'm payin' Dwayne Wade
Three dice cee-lo, three card monte
Labor Day Parade, rest in peace Bob Marley
Statue of Liberty, long live the World Trade
Long live the King yo, I'm from the Empire St. that's

Lights is blinding, girls need blinders
So they can step out of bounds quick, the sidelines is
Lined with casualties, who sip to life casually
Then gradually become worse, don't bite the apple, Eve
Caught up in the in-crowd, now you're in style
End of the winter gets cold, en vogue, with your skin out
City of sin, it's a pity on the whim
Good girls gone bad, the city's filled with them
Mommy took a bus trip, now she got her bust out
Everybody ride her, just like a bus route
Hail Mary to the city, you're a virgin
And Jesus can't save you, life starts when the church end
Came here for school, graduated to the high life
Ball players, rap stars, addicted to the limelight
MDMA got you feelin' like a champion
The city never sleeps, better slip you an Ambien

One hand in the air for the big city
Street lights, big dreams, all lookin' pretty
No place in the world that could compare
Put your lighters in the air everybody say yeah, yeah,
Yea, yea

To all the lovers who cant be together
Separated by distance and time

You were always on my mind
All I do is count the days
Where are you now?

Know I never let you down
I will never go away

I really wish that you would stay but what would we do

No matter how long it takes him
Through distance and time

And if you have to walk a million miles
I'll wait a million days to see you smile
Distance and time, I'll be waiting

Will you take a train, to meet me where I am
Are you on your way?

But if I'm seeing my dreams and you aren't there
'Cause it's over
That just wont be fair

Rather be a poor woman living on the street
No food to eat
'Cause I don't want no pie if I have to cry
'Cause it's over
When you said goodbye!

All at once
I had it all
But it doesn't mean anything
Now that you're gone
From afar, seems I had it all
But it doesn't mean anything
Since you're gone

Now I see myself through different eyes
It's no surprise!
Being alone will make you realize
When it's over!

Take these material things
They don't mean nothing

Leaves you on your knees

Over, over

Love is like the sea
Leaves on your knees
First your floatin' high
Then takes you, takes you
Under, under

Well its cold
Cold under water
In the night time

Dove to the bottom
To see what I find

That's when I saw a light
A glowing paradise
Thought I stay a while
Its been calling me underwater
Try, everything that I ever dream

Taking my breath away
Current got a hold on me
Sweeping me away
Wish that I could stay
Takes me to the top
Its the cycle that never stops

Told you only find it once in a lifetime
So you better hold
Hold on stronger then ever
Like its the last time

So when you see the light
Like a ship in the night
You have found the place
You've been looking for
Like a distant shore
Don't you ever look back again

Here is something you should know, know
Seas is still in control
Cherish everyday
Cause never know
It can take away

My self delusions are leaving me in the storm
Taking for granted, all the goodness that I've found
Somewhere I lost all, the control came crashing down

And I pray for forgiveness
Look for the answer
Cause it's hard
For me to pretend
Look to my mother
Call to the captain
Can't you see
This state that I'm in
No one would notice
Nobody noticed
Cause it's me where it began

Beautiful morning, please don't wake me from my sleep
Cause I need some comfort, to regain my sanity
I don't want to feel this crazy,
I don't want to feel this heartache
Shattered in a million pieces
I'm so broken hearted
No where left to run
No where left to go
So I hope

I pray for forgiveness
Look for the answer
Cause it's hard for me to pretend

Look to my mother
Call to the captain
Can't you see
This state that I'm in?
And no one would notice
Nobody noticed
That it's me, where it began
And I pray for forgiveness within

I swear that everyday I feel like my mind is haunting me
I think of every little stupid mistake that is made
This time I'll have the strength to gather myself
I'm falling to pieces

And I pray for forgiveness
Look for the answer
Cause it's hard for me to pretend
Look to my mother
Call to the captain
Can't you see
This state that I'm in

Looking for justice
Searching for answers
Call to my mother

But this is bigger than triumph
This is for the warrior, this is for you and I
This is for euphoria, give me a piece of mind
God is recording this, won't you look in the sky?
Tell him that you got the behavior of your neighbor
Even when stability's never in your favor
Fly with the turbulence, only last a minute
Land on your dreams, and recognize you live it
Walk through the valley and peaks, with bare feet
Run through the flames, that's more passion for me
I passed testimony just so the world can see
My battle wounds on me, you watching me lick ‘em clean
I know, I know, my pride, my goals, my highs, my lows
I know, I know, it's mind control
I know I could prosper, no impostor, prosecute my posture
I stand up and I stand by her, what?

I am a freedom fighter
The name that history wrote
And even through disaster
Eye of the tiger for hope

There's no day off for heroes
And even when I'm tired, 
Go is the only word I know

And the night is takin' over
And the moonlight gets exposure
And the players have been chosen
And it seems like fate has spoken
When it seems your faith has broken

Ain't no way to get off, get off, get off, get off
Unless you move forward

I bet they wonder how I go on, go on
I bet they wonder how I go on, go on
I'll simply say it's on again
It's on again, whoah
The world don't stop, it's on again
It's on again, whoah

I am a lonely hero
Trying to fight my battles
Life likes to blow the cold wind
Sometimes it freezes my shadow
In the midst of all this darkness
I sacrifice my ego
There ain't no room for selfish
We do it for the people

Everybody from the burbs down to the block

What if I don't want to put on all that make up?
Who says I must conceal what I'm made of?
Maybe all this Maybelline is covering my self-esteem
Whose job is it to straighten out my curves?
I'm so tired of that image, that's my word
What if today I don't feel like putting heels on?

Why is being unique such an impurity?
Why are the numbers on the scale like a god to me?
All of these indifferences are based on our appearances
We please to be appeased

You don't have to, agree
But if you feel like me

Someone get this Aryan a sheet
Time to bury him, so tell him to prepare to get impeached
Everybody on your feet
This is where terrorism and heroism meet, square off in the street
This chump barely even sleeps
All he does is watch Fox News like a parrot and repeats
While he looks like a canary with a beak
Why you think he banned transgenders from the military with a tweet? 
He's tryin' to divide us, this shit's like a cult
But like Johnny he'll only unite us
'Cause nothin' inside us drives us like this fight does
Similar to when two cars collide 'cause
Our spirit's crushed, and this spot's a tight one
But here the jaws of life come
To pull us from the wreckage, that's what we get pride from
When we can’t from our stars and stripes cause
This type of pickle that we're in is hard to deal
But there's always tomorrow still
If we start from scratch like a scab, get the scars to heal
And band together for Charlottesville
And for Heather, fallen heroes, fill this wall with murals
Nevada get up, hit the damn resetter
Let's start from zero, this is our renewal
Spray tan, get rid of, get a brand new, better
America, and here's to where it all

You stay on Twitter, way to get your hate off
Nazi, I do not see a way y'all differ
And all you got are race cards, bigot
The swastika with your name carved in it
Should be your trademark, 'cause hate's all you played off
And you just lick the plate off
So I guess it pays to feed off of chaos
So basically, you ate off Hitler!
But you ain't ruinin' our country, punk
Or takin' our pride from us, you won't define us
'Cause like a dictionary, things are lookin' up
So much, got a sprained neck, know we would rise up
Against this train wreck and take a stand
Even if it means sittin' when they raise the flag
To sing ""The Star-Spangled Banner""
This man just praised a statue of General Lee
'Cause he generally hates the black people, degrades hispanics
Take it back to the Shady national convention
Wish I woulda spit on it before I went to shake his hand
At the event or maybe had the wherewithal
To know that he was gonna try to tear apart

I know it could not happen without your love
Ooh without your love

It took a long time for it to happen
But I knew those nights I prayed
That you would send me someone who's real
And not no one for play
I kept the faith
And didn't worry
My nights grew longer than the days
Until one day
It really happen
Sent true love my way
I know it couldn't have happened without you
Ooh without you

When the time is right
He'll fill your life with love and care
Believe
And He'll be there
Just do all right
Don't do no wrong
And the keep the faith
The Lord will shine his light your way
Thank you Father
For shining your light on me
I prayed long time
For it to happen
I did because I believe
He makes me happy
So very happy
I don't know how to be
It's been a long time
Since I had someone who love me
I owe my thanks to Thee

I know it couldn't have happened without you
Ooh without you
I know it couldn't have happened without your love

Que sólo amas por interés
Que has engañado a más de tres

Que eres buen amante y mal amigo
Que mientras te aguante seguirás conmigo

Que falle y que estuve mal

Amiga no quise molestar
La relación que tenías con él
Tan sólo quería escucharte y ayudarte
Pero insistías en hablarme

Todo lo que hacías con él
Inconscientemente poco a poco

Pero dime que se hace
Cuando el corazón se cruza
Y no quiere entender

Justificar mi gran amor
Pero surgió así de pronto, de la nada
Por que insistías en hablarme

Todo lo que hacías con él
Te lo juro que intente dejarlo
Pero le amo más que a mí

Aline,"Le soir devant ma glace, je m'entraîne
A bouger en cadence, à me rapprocher de l’arène
Je la suis à la trace mais elle me sème
Légère et arrogante
Elle glisse sans chercher à me plaire
Je voudrais l’oublier et je me sers
Je bois et puis je danse, je ne sais pas comment
Je bois et puis je danse

C’est vrai qu’elle est infiniment belle
Je pourrais l’embrasser
La prendre et mordre dans sa chair
Tenter ma chance à tort en travers
Et passer pour un fou
Cela n’en vaudrait pas la peine
Allez, pour me venger je me sers
Je bois et puis je danse, je ne sais pas comment
Je bois et puis je danse

Sortir avec elle, la prendre dans mes bras
Que je me donne plus qu’elle se donne
Hélas, autour de moi, il y a comme un voile
J’aimerais tant que, pour une fois
Ce qu’elle me donne elle me le donne

Dans les yeux noirs d’un garçon elle se perd
J’aurais dû essayer, ce soir je dormirai par terre
Je me plonge tout entier en arrière
Au fond du trou noir l’univers est infiniment clair
Dans les bras d’un autre homme elle se sert
Je bois et puis je danse, je ne sais pas comment
Je bois et puis je pense.

Sortir avec elle, la prendre dans mes bras
Que je me donne plus qu’elle se donne
Hélas, autour de moi, il y a comme un voile
J’aimerais tant que, pour une fois
Ce qu’elle me donne elle me le donne

Au milieu des limaces, je me traîne

Souviens-toi de ce soleil pâle
Du ciel couleur de corail
Sans regrets
De toutes ces belles fumées sales
De l'Avenue des Armées

De petite fille amoureuse
Mêmpêcheraient de m'en aller
Souris-moi (Souris-moi) et prends ma peine
Je t'aime toujours un peu quand même
Mais je ne peux plus t'embrasser
Souviens-toi de ce matin calme
De cette nuit sans soleil
De ces nuits blanches et de l'éther
Qui coulaient dans nos veines
Souveins-toi de ces lumières pâles
Du bruit du train sur les rails

Ne me regardes pas, je pleure
Souris-moi (Souris-moi)
Ne me regardes pas, je pleure

Je fonce à travers les murailles

Des regrets

Disparues à tout jamais",Avenue des armées,2015

dans ton viseur comme une cible.

quand je te dis du bout des lèvres…

prends bien ton temps la vue est belle.
A chaque marche mes yeux se perdent,
une seule décharge et je crève.

Vas-y chérie fous moi en l'air.
La vie électrique nous entraine.
Les deux doigts dans la prise,
je veux voir des éclairs.

Je boirai l'eau trouble à la source,
de celle qui coule entre tes cuisses.
Je lécherai ta peau comme un ours,
avide de miel, un délice.

Allez monte je te suis y a le jour qui se lève,
prends bien ton temps la vue est belle.
A chaque marche mes yeux se perdent,
encore une décharge et je crève.

Drinking her wine 
We talked until two and then she said

In the morning and started to laugh

Alisan Porter,"Daddy always thought that he married beneath him 
That's what he said, that's what he said. 
When he proposed he informed my mother
He was probably her very last chance.
And though she was twenty-two, 
Though she was twenty-two, 
Though she was twenty-two
She married him. 

Life with my dad wasn't ever a picnic
More like a ""come as you are.""
When I was five I remember my mother 
Dug earrings out of the car. 
I knew they weren't hers, but it wasn't 
Something you'd want to discuss. 
He wasn't warm.
Well, not to her.
Well, not to us 

But
Everything was beautiful at the ballet. 
Graceful men lift lovely girls in white. 
Yes,
Everything was beautiful at ballet, 
Hey!
I was happy at the ballet. 

That's when I started class. 

Up a steep and very narrow stairway 

To the voice like a metronome 
Up a steep and very narrow stairway 

It wasn't paradise. 

It wasn't paradise. 

It wasn't paradise. 

But it was home. 

Mother always said I'd be very attractive 
When I grew up, when I grew up. 
""Diff'rent,"" she said, ""With a special something 
And a very, very personal flair.""
And though I was eight or nine,
Though I was eight or nine, 
Though I was eight or nine, 
I hated her. 

Now, 
""Diff'rent"" is nice, but it sure isn't pretty.
""Pretty"" is what it's about. 
I never met anyone who was ""diff'rent""
Who couldn't figure that out. 
So beautiful I'd never lived to see. 
But it was clear, 
If not to her,
Well then to me 

That everyone is beautiful at the ballet. 
Every prince has got to have his swan.
Yes,
Everyone is beautiful at the ballet. 

Hey! 

I was pretty 

At the ballet.

It wasn't paradise. 

It wasn't paradise. 

It wasn't paradise. 

But it was home. 

I don't know what they were for or against, really, except each other. 
I mean, I was born to save their marriage 
But when my father came to pick my mother up at the hospital he said, 
""Well, I thought this was going to help. 
But I guess it's not."" 
Anyway, I did have a fantastic fantasy life. 
I used to dance around the living room with my arms up like this. 
My fantasy was that it was an Indian Chief 
And he'd say to me, 
""Maggie, do you wanna dance?"" 
And I'd say, ""Daddy, I would love to dance."" 

But it was clear. 

When he proposed. 

That I was born to help their marriage and when 

That's what he said. 

That's what she said. 

I used to dance around the living room.

Alison Faith Levy,"Moonlight and magnolia, starlight in your hair
All the world a dream come true
Did it really happen, was I really there, was I really there with you?
 
We lived our little drama, we kissed in a field of white
And stars fell on Alabama last night
I can't forget the glamor, your eyes held a tender light
And stars fell on Alabama last night
I never planned in my imagination a situation so heavenly
A fairy land where no one else could enter
And in the center just you and me, dear
My heart beat like a hammer, my arms wound around you tight
And stars fell on Alabama last night

Alison Faith Levy,"Don't know why there's no sun up in the sky
Stormy weather
Since my man and I ain't together,
Keeps rainin' all the time

Life is bare, gloom and misery everywhere
Stormy weather
Just can't get my poor self together,
I'm weary all the time
So weary all the time
When he went away the blues walked in and met me.
If he stays away old rockin' chair will get me.

All I do is pray the lord above will let me walk in the sun once more.
Can't go on, every thing I had is gone

Alison Fraser,"I think you were chosen
[Incomprehensible]
What you've got to do is finish
What you have begun
I don't know just how
But it's not over till you've won

When you see the storm is coming
See the lightning part the skies
It's too late to run
There's terror in your eyes
What you do then is remembered
This old thing you heard me say
""It's the storm, not you
That's bound to blow away""

Hold on
Hold on to someone standing by
Hold on
Don't even ask how long or why?
Child, hold on to what you know is true
Hold on till you get through
Child, oh child
Hold on

When you feel your heart is poundin'
Fear a devil's at your door
There's no place to hide
You're frozen to the floor
What you do then is you force yourself
To wake up, and just say
""It's this dream, not me
That's bound to go away""

Hold on
Hold on, the night will soon be by
Hold on
Until there's nothing left to try
Child, hold on, there's angels on their way
Hold on and hear them say
""Child, oh child!""

And it doesn't even matter
If the danger and the doom
Come from up above or down below
Or just come flying at you from across the room

When you see a man who's raging
And he's jealous and he fears
That you've walked through walls
He's hid behind for years
What you do then
Is you tell yourself to wait it out
And say ""It's this day, not me
That's bound to go away""

Child, oh hold on
It's this day, not you
That's bound to go away",Hold On,1991
Alison Goldfrapp,"It's a strange day  
No colors or shapes  
No sound in my head  
I forget who I am  

When I'm with you  
There's no reason  
There's no sense  

I'm not supposed to feel  
I forget who I am

Walking proudly in our winter coats
Wearing smells from laboratories
Facing a dying nation of moving paper fantasy
Listening for the new told lies
With supreme visions of lonely tunes

Who knows what stands in front of our lives
I fashion my future on films in space
Silence tells me secretly ev'rything, ev'rything
Singing my space songs on a spiderweb star

Vagrant on a path to life

Everyday feels a little closer
To where it is that you're headed for
Given to a hope of so much more

[Chorus]
For every time you fall apart
There'll be a soul to guide your journey
But if you choose to turn away
There in the mirror
You'll see my face
You'll see my face

Think you're on this road alone
Looking for a truth untold

Many times you've been close to breaking
Giving up and letting go
Something inside says it's not over

Remember days when noise was silent
Now empty vows, loveless displays

Alison Jiear,"Hey! Give me a listen you corpses of cheer
At least those of you who still got an ear
I'll tell you a story that'll make a skeleton cry
Of our own jubiliciously lovely corpse bride

Die, die we all pass away
But don't wear a frown 'cause it's really okay
And you might try and hide
And you might try and pray
But we all end up the remains of the day
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah (that's right)
Yeah yeah yeah

Well our girl is a beauty known for miles around
When a mysterious stranger came into town
He's plenty good-looking, but down on his cash
And our poor little baby, she fell hard and fast
When her daddy said no, she just couldn't cope
So our lovers came up with a plan to elope

Die, die we all pass away
But don't wear a frown 'cause it's really okay
And you might try and hide
And you might try and pray

Yeah. Like it.
Okay, Chancy, take it.
Yeah. Yeah! That's nice
Yeah!

So they conjured up a plan to meet late at night
They told not a soul, kept the whole thing tight
Now, her mother's wedding dress fit like a glove
You don't need much when you're really in love
Except for a few things, or some told
Like the family jewels and a satchel of gold
Then next to the graveyard by the old oak tree
On a dark foggy night at a quarter to three
She was ready to go, but where was he?

And then?

She waited

And then?

There in the shadows, was it her man?

And then?

Her little heart beat so loud

And then?

And then baby, everything went black

Now when she opened her eyes she was dead as dust
Her jewels were missing and her heart was bust
So she made a vow lying under that tree
That she'd wait for her true love to come set her free
Always waiting for someone to ask for her hand
When out of the blue comes this groovy young man
Who vows forever to be by her side
And that's the story of our own corpse bride

Die, die we all pass away
But don't wear a frown 'cause it's really okay
And you might try and hide
And you might try and pray

Hear the mighty engines moan

But in your eyes I found love at last

I found your love waiting at my door,

",In Your Eyes,1987
Alison Krauss,"There's a chill on this evening, nights right for greaving,
Darkness surrounds him as he wanders alone
He walked past the dim lights, the pathways and street lights
They remind him, of nights long ago,
When his love was strong and his muscles hard, His whiskey throat was barley marred,
Seeking misfortune in the lies that he told, Then a brokin heart bought him to his knees,
In the hour of his greatest need, Lost and forsaken by the love, he could not hold

[Chorus:]
On the Border line of love again, Its bound to make you pay
On the Border line, we'll make our stand, Then watch it fall away

And he stands in quiet solitude, The nights reflects upon his mood,
Seeking the vision that had once been so clear, When he felt the touch of his women's love
His pounding heart was warm and young, Now locked inside him with his anger and fear

As he moves on slowly, past the trees, Down the path way home through fallen leaves
He can't believe, how he'd sunken so low, So he learned to live with his injured pride
His purple heart hidden, deep inside, The only reward, for a love he could not hold

[Chorus 2x]




",On the Borderline,1987
Alison Krauss,"Could your heart ever be mine
Your arms hold me so close to you
All through the night
Your eyes gaze into mine
Saying I should believe you
I always do, I don't know why
 
Cause you taught me a lesson the hard way one time
Told me you loved me but then changed your mind
I never told no one how I hurt down inside until now
Sleep on
 
Could your heart ever be mine
My arms hold me so close to me 
All through the night
My heart warned me this time
But I need to believe you
I do, just for tonight

Promised you loved me but then changed your mind

Lately, it just ain't my style
And hard times don't last like they used to
They pass quicker, like when I was a child.

Somehow I've learned how to listen
To a sound like the sun going down
And the magic the morning is bringing home
A song for a life I have found
It keeps my feet on the ground

But don't they blow like a breeze through your mind
When nothing appears in a hurry
To make up for someone's lost time

Alison Krauss,"Sitting all alone with my whisky on ice,
I wonder why he's not with me tonight.
If the rain be on tonight then I won't sleep.
I'm haunted by this loneliness I keep.

And it's too late to cry cause we left it all behind,
Too late to cry cause there's nothing left defied.
You won't get more than you're living for,
And it's too late to cry tonight.

It doesn't seem much point in us carrying on,
We pretend to cry but the feelings are gone.
I hear the death man has lost his mate,
The silence that follows him tells me about our fate.

And it's too late to cry cause we left it all behind,
Too late to cry cause there's nothing left defied.
You won't get more than you're living for,
And it's too late to cry tonight.

Empty glass before me tells the story in my eyes,
The dimness it has giving me won't let me realize.
That love is more or less the state of mind we go through,
With no guarantee to what it holds me or you.

And it's too late to cry cause we left it all behind,
Too late to cry cause there's nothing left defied.
You won't get more than you're living for,
And it's too late to cry tonight.",Too Late to Cry,1988

And miss it each night and day
I know I'm not wrong, the feeling's getting stronger 
The longer I stay away

Miss the moss-covered vines, tall sugar pines
Where mockingbirds used to sing
I'd love to see that old lazy Mississippi
Hurrying into Spring

The moonlight on the bayou
A Creole tune that fills the air
I dream about magnolias in bloom
And I'm wishin' I was there

But it won't shine brighter than the stars in your eyes
It rises above me so bright and so blue

Past these lonely dreams in my heart
I love you, more than I could show you
More than I could know, in my heart

So lay down beside me and hold me tonight
For your love has found me and it feels so right
These thoughts in my mind are so scattered and few
And I won't see anyone as lovely as you

And rose from the grave

Not one little grave (not one little grave),
In all that fair land (that wonderful land).

And no one up there will say goodbye
Just singing His praise through endless days

There'll be someone on the other side
Welcoming me to that fair land, made perfect by love
When I walk up the milky white way,

How great it must be for angels to see

I wonder why he left, his love I tried to keep
I don't understand him and I guess I never will
He could always make my heart stand still

He may not have loved me, or cared for me at all
But through all the teardrops, he sure made me fall
And when we were together, my world was in a spin
I will never love him again

Lying in my mind with the things I've known before
I've lost count of the hours, days, and nights

It's like I always figured
You'd be gone from me so soon
A heartache would be the outcome
And I'd be singing this lonely tune

Your friends all tell me your happy now
And how good she's treating you
It looks to be the perfect love
Well tonight, I'll be lonely too

You're only trying to show me
It's no use, the pain's in your eyes
I know you've been so unhappy
Talk of new love, the words are all lies

So you'll go on pretending like always
Well tonight, I'll be lonely too

Wear your heart upon your sleeve

Keep me laughing while you leave

Before you walk away?

Will you be leaving, leaving me today?
Like the ocean leaves us waiting on the sand
Crumbling in our hand
I can't live this scene again

You may turn away in silence
While the tears run down your face
Say there's nothing left to bind us
Leaving love without a trace
But if I loved you well 
You'd soon find out why your new love falls some day
Why can't we burn this heartache down
Before you walk away?

Nights of lonely cries unheard
In the winter of a broken heart

Oh the nights will never be the same as when the love was new
Young hearts so tender in their yearning
But seasons, change and lovers too
And winter's twice as cold
But the fire in one heart is always burning

Sorrow lingers, shadows only fill the empty room
Nights of lonely cries unheard
In the winter of a broken heart

Though a million hours pass the time and lonely is the pain
And what was love is just a spell that's broken
So blow the wind and freeze the rain and try like lover's do
Seems our hearts have never really spoken

Like a haven safe from harm
Till the bitter stole the sweet

Till it all fell apart with one change of heart

You can't always trust happiness
Love like a sweet parade till the saddest part when the music fades
You can't always trust happiness

If a single star I see
Ever made a wish come true
It would bring you back to me

Is to love again, I don't know when
Still it's worth all I fear, the heartaches and the tears

I don't answer the door,
I just soon be alone
I don't keep this place up,
I just keep the lights down,
I don't live in these rooms,
I just rattled around

I'm just a ghost in this house,
I'm shadow upon these walls,
As quietly as a mouse,
I haunt these halls,
I'm just a whisper of smoke,
I'm all that's left of two hearts on fire,
That once burned out of control,
You took my body and soul,
I'm just a ghost in this house

I don't care if it rains,
I don't care if it's clear,
I don't mind stayin' near,
There's another ghost here,
He sits down in your chair,
And he shines with your light,
And he lays down his head,
On your pillow at night

I'm just a ghost in this house,
I'm just a shadow upon these walls,
I'm living proof of the damage heartbreak does,
I'm just a whisper of smoke,
I'm all that's left of two hearts on fire,
That once burned out of control,
You took my body and soul,
I'm just a ghost in this house

That once burned out of control,
You took my body and soul,
I'm just a ghost in this house",Ghost in This House,1999
Alison Krauss,"It's finally come
Is that sorry on your breath?
Where were you when 
I was sitting back here
Missing you to death?
It don't matter now
How, I want to know
Can you tell me plain and true
How high will you fly
Without me there to be your sky?
Well, it don't matter now
 
Don't mean to leave you 
Standing on your own
I think back on days and nights 
We had long ago
Maybe love 
Is just a game you play
This much I do know
It don't matter now
 
It's finally come
Is that sorry on your breath?
Where were you when 
I was sitting back here
Missing you to death?
It don't matter now
Now I don't tell stories
And I don't pretend
I won't be around 
To say I told you then
'Cause it seems like something's 
Finally broken
That'll take a lot of mend
But it don't matter now
 
Is that sorry on your breath?
Where were you when I 
Was sitting back here
Missing you to death?

Alison Krauss,"Do you remember the last time I said
If I ever thought of lying
I'd rather think of dying instead
And the last time you called me
To say we were through
How it took a million tears
Just to prove they all were for you
 
But it wouldn't have made any difference,
If you loved me
How could you love me
When it wouldn't have made any difference,
If you loved me
You just did not love me
 
'Cause I know of hundreds of times I could be
In the most unfaithful arms
That you always picture me 
Though I can't always show proof I was true
No one else could change my mind
Or stop me coming home to you
 
But it wouldn't have made any difference,
If you loved me
How could you love me
When it wouldn't have made any difference,
If you loved me
You just did not love me
 
Enough to believe me
Enough not to leave me
Enough not to look for
A reason to be unhappy with me
And make me regret ever wanting you
 
It wouldn't have made any difference
Wouldn't have made any difference",It Wouldn't Have Made Any Difference,1999
Alison Krauss,"Yesterday the odds were stacked 
In favor of my expectations
Flyin' above the rest, 
Never fallin' from the nest
Tuesday came and went 
And now I'm in a little situation
Maybe it's for the best
I can live alone, I guess
 
[Chorus]
Maybe I can stand alone
Maybe I'm strong as stone
Even though the bird has flown
Maybe he'll fly on home
 
Forgive me if I'm keeping you apart 
From better conversation
I'm hung up on all my doubt
Trying to sort the whole thing out
Tell me that I'm smart enough 
To deal with all the information
Spinning inside my head
Every word he ever said
 
[Chorus: x2]",Maybe,1999
Alison Krauss,"My father was a farmer
But his head was in the sky
He worked everyday but Sunday
'Til the day he died

He prayed for rain and thunder
And listened for the sound
In the dry years he went under
He never got off the ground
 
We all dream when we're younger
That we will do great things
Me, I used to have a hunger 
To wear a pilot's wings
 
But the circle's that I ran in
Turned my head around
And the planes I had my plans in
Never got off the ground
 
Don't raise your hopes
You hear so many say
The higher they get
The closer they are to flying away
Fly away
 
Don't raise your hopes
You hear so many say
The higher they get
The closer they are to flying away
 
They say there but for fortune
Is the way it would have been
If we could take a bigger portion
We'd fill our hands again

You see them on the sidewalks
In the parks all over town
Those who've taken flight
Never got off the ground",Never Got Off the Ground,1999
Alison Krauss,"Who would sell their soul for love
Or waste one tear on compromise?
Should be easy enough
To know a heartache in disguise
But the heart rules the mind
And the going gets rough
Pride takes the fall
When you find that kind of love
 
I can't help feeling like a fool
Since I lost that place inside
Where my heart knew its way
And my soul was ever wise
Once innocence was lost
There was not faith enough
Still my heart held on
When it found that kind of love
 
Though beauty is rare enough
Still we trust
Somehow we'll find it there
With no guarantee
It seems to me
At least it should be fair
 
But if it's only tears and pain
Isn't it still worth the cost
Like some sweet saving grace
Or a river we must cross
If we don't understand
What this life is made of
We learn the truth
When we find that kind of love
Cause when innocence is lost
There is not faith enough
We learn the truth
When we find that kind of love",That Kind of Love,1999
Alison Krauss,"Who can blame you, though your heart's untrue
When you say it's my fault anyway?
You turn your head from the tears I've shed
Though your heart is untrue, who can blame you

You justify yourself in your love for someone else
When you say, I never loved you anyway
Your vows were made in vain, although my love still remains
Though you broke my heart in two, who can blame you

Who can blame you, though your heart's untrue
When you say it's my fault anyway?
You turn your head from the tears I've shed
Though your heart is untrue, who can blame you

In a heart of rusty steel you kept your love affair concealed
'Til the day she was asking you to stay
You turned your head from the tears I've shed
Though you broke a heart in two, who can blame you

Who can blame you, though your heart's untrue
When you say it's my fault anyway?
You turn your head from the tears I've shed
Though your heart is untrue, who can blame you

Who can blame you, though your heart's untrue
When you say it's my fault anyway?

Alison Krauss,"Look at the sky, baby
What do you see?
Looks like the tears that I cry
Fallin' down like rain on the ground
Every time you say goodbye

Take a look around now
Why don't you feel
The way that cold wind stings and bites
And your words just are like arrows through my heart
Every time you say goodbye

There's a restless feeling knocking at my door today
There's a shadow hanging 'round my garden gate
I read between the lines of words you can't disguise
Love has gone away, and put these tears in my eyes

Look at the sky, baby, see how it cries?
Ain't it just like my tears
Fallin' down like rain on the ground

Alison Krauss,"Where have you been,
My long lost friend?
It's good to see you again.
Come and sit for a while
I've missed your smile
Today the past is goodbye.
Time can't erase
A lover's embrace.
Can't you hear it calling?
A new day dawning
You were longing to find.

Love's taken you far
Away from my heart,
And I've been here all alone.
Have your eyes failed to find
What took you from mine,
A vision that's faded through time?
But you sailed away,
A fine summer's day,
Cause you heard it calling,
A new day dawning,
You were longing to find.

There is a way to make you stay.
Darlin' don't turn away
Don't doubt your heart
and keep us apart
I'm right where you are

Don't doubt your heart

Alison Krauss,"From thirty thousand feet above the desert floor I see it there below 
A city with a legend, the West Texas city of El Paso 
Where long ago I heard a song about a Texas cowboy and a girl 
And a little place called Rosa's where he used to go and watch this beauty whirl 

I don't recall who sang the song but I recall a story that I heard 
And as I look down on this city I remember each and every word 
The singer sang about a jealous cowboy and the way he used a gun 
To kill another cowboy, then he had to leave El Paso on the run 

El Paso City 
By the Rio Grande 
The cowboy lived and rode away but love was strong he couldn't stay 
He rode back just to die in that El Paso sand 
El Paso City 
By the Rio Grande 
I try not to let you cross my mind but still I find
There's such a mystery in the song that I don't understand 

My mind is down there somewhere as I fly above the badlands of New Mexico 
I can't explain why I should know the very trail he rode back to El Paso 
Can it be that man can disappear from life and live another time 
And does the mystery deepen 'cause you think that you yourself lived in that other time 

Somewhere in my deepest thoughts familiar scenes and memories unfold 
These wild and unexplained emotions that I've had so long, but I have never told 
Like everytime I fly up through the heavens and I see you there below 
I get the feeling sometime in another world I lived in El Paso 

El Paso City 
By the Rio Grande 
Could it be that I could be the cowboy in the mystery 
That died there in that desert sand so long ago 
El Paso City 
By the Rio Grande 
A voice tells me to go and seek, another voice keeps telling me 
Maybe death awaits me in El Paso 

El Paso City",Why Me?,1999
