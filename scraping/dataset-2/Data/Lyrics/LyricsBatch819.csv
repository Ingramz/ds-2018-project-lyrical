Patrizia,"If they ask me, I could write a book
About the way you walk and whisper and look
I could write a preface on how we met
So the world would never forget

And the simple secret of the plot
Is just to tell them that I love you, a lot
Then the world discovers as my book ends
How to make two lovers of friends

Patrizia,"The shadow of your smile
When you have gone
Will color all my dreams
And light the dawn

Look into my eyes my love and see
All the lovely things you are to me

Our wistful little star
It was far, too high
A teardrop kissed your lips
And so did I

Now when I remember spring
All the joys that love can bring
I will be remembering
The shadow of your smile",The Shadow of Your Smile,2007

Is like a flame that lights the gloom
On the wings of ev'ry kiss 
Drift a melody so strange and sweet

Paradise complete
Rose pearls seem to fall
It's all like a dream to call you mine
My heart's lighter thing 
Since you made me this night a thing divine

That you'd be loving sentimental me

Patrizia Scascitelli,"You don't know what love is
'Til you've learned the meaning of the blues
Until you've loved a love you've had  to lose,
You don't know what love  is.

You don't know how lips hurt
Until you've kissed and had to pay the cost,
Until you've flipped your heart and you have lost,
You don't know what love is.

Do you know how a lost heart fears
At the thought of reminiscing,
And how lips that taste of tears
Lose their taste for kissing?
You don't know how hearts burn
For love that can, not live yet never dies.
Until you've faced each dawn with sleepless eyes,
You don't know what love is.",You Don't Know What Love Is,1998
Patrizia Scascitelli,"Maybe I should have saved those left over dreams
Funny, but here's that rainy day
Here's that rainy day they told me about
And I laughed at the thought that it might turn out this way

Where is that worn out wish that I threw aside
After it brought my lover near
It's funny how love becomes a cold rainy day
Funny, that rainy day is here

Funny how love becomes a cold rainy day

My love, forgive me,
I didn't mean to have it end like this,
I didn't mean to have you fall in love,
In love with me.
My love, please kiss me,
Arrivederci amore, kiss me,
Remember when we part, you'll have my heart,
I love you so!
It was just a slight flirtation,
That was all it was to be.
How could I know this fascination
Would turn to love for you and me.
How to tell you of my heartache?
How to tell you I'm not free?
How can I bear to see your heart break,
To see your heart break over me.
Amore scusami se sto piangendo
Amore scusami, ma ho capito che lasciandoti
Io soffriro,
Amore baciami, arrivederci amore baciami,
E se mi penserai ricordati che amo te.

E' inutile suonare, qui non vi aprira' nessuno
Il mondo l'abbiam chiuso fuori con il suo casino
Una bugia coi tuoi
Il frigo pieno e poi
Un calcio alla TV
Solo io, solo tu.
E' inutile chiamare, non risponderÃ¡ nessuno
Il telefono e' volato fuori giu' dal quarto piano
Era importante sai
Pensare un poco a noi
Non stiamo insieme mai
Ora si, ora qui.
Soli
La pelle come un vestito
Soli
Mangiando un panino in due, io e te
Soli
Le briciole nel letto
Soli
Ma stretti un po' di piu'
Solo io, solo tu.
Il mondo dietro ai vetri sembra un film senza sonoro
E il tuo pudore amando rende il corpo tuo piu' vero
Sei bella quando vuoi
Bambina, donna e poi
Non mi deludi mai
E' cosi' che mi vai.
Soli
Lasciando la luce accesa
Soli
Ma guarda nel cuore chi see'e': io e te
Soli
Col tempo che si e' fermato
Soli
Pero' finalmente noi
Soli noi, soli noi
Una bugia coi tuoi
Il frigo pieno e poi
Un calcio alla TV
Solo io, solo tu.

E ovunque andro che mi sara vicino

Pensando che è finita mi solleverá
Perchè nel cuore
Io so che un angelo c'è

Invisibile nel dolore che civilta nell'anima
C'e una strada che non si illumina

And find romance
In via roma
In every bar
Sweet guitar
And sounds of laughter

I simply smiled
And raised a glass when she walked over
Then love began
She took my hand and said
""let's dance""

We were sliding to the left
Bello bello!
We were swaying to the right
Bello bello
Oh my head was in a spin
Bello bello
But I held her body tight

And then this bella bella signorina
With a smile so tender
She put a rythm in my feet
As we danced this crazy beat

Ooh my bella bella signorina
Baby I surrender
Can you teach me more tonight?
Or must I dance till mornin' light

Uh

It was by chance
And circumstance that I should meet her
Who would suspect
I would be infected by her fever?
I raised my arms and shouted out
""la dolce vita!!""
Then once again
She took my hand
And said ""let's dance""

We were sliding to the left
Bello bello!
We were swaying to the right

Oh my head was in a spin

But I held her body tight

And then this bella bella signorina
Moved a 'lil closer
And she whispered
""don't be shy you seem to be my
Kinda guy""

I'm no casanova
But im italian through and through!
So lemme show you what we do!

We made a pact to take the time
To get to know each other deep inside
No rushing in to cross the line
It may be a little old fashioned but it feels so right

Bridge:
Been holding back for so long
What feels so right can't be wrong
Baby you can read it in my eyes
Let's write the story of our lives tonight

Chorus:
Don't be afraid, turn down the light
Baby move in closer
It's gonna be alright
This is the moment we'll remember all our lives
Forever begins tonight

I know you fear those butterflies
But let me tell you a secret, so am I
But it's OK
Baby it's alright
Just follow our hearts now
What we feel inside
Yeah

So my arms reach out to you my love
With your hand resting in mine
I feel a power so divine

You're my world, you are my night and day
You're my world, you're every prayer I pray
If our love ceases to be
Then it's the end of my world for me

Patrulla 81,"En el reten de la loma
Estaban cien federales
Preguntando por Pedrito
También por Paulino Burgos
Pero andaban despistados
Le preguntaron a un mudo

Clave siete es la consigna
De agentes y de soldados
Ese león ya creo melena
Van a tener que matarlo
Nomás no se arriesguen mucho
Primero hay que traicionarlo

Le mandaron un agente
Que le pidiera dinero
Le entrego veinte millones
Era el precio de su cuero
Pero como era chabuco
Lo llevaron prisionero

Junto con seis compañeros
Además dos señoritas
Los llevaron a la y griega
Era la última cita
Y ahí los acribillaron
Junto con las señoritas

Desde ese día inolvidable
No ronda tanto dinero
Y unos agentes traidores
Ahora estrenan carro nuevo
Y un hombre en Guadalajara
No duerme de puro miedo

Mis armas no las entrego
Van a quedar en el cerro
No me fió en los amigos
Que los deslumbra el dinero
Ya murió el León de la sierra
Vengan a quitarle el cuero

Oiga señor comandante
Aquí lo llevo en mi lista
Usted me hecho por delante
Ahí lo espero en la revista
Ya que tumbo mi panal
Ahora toree las avispas

Adiós todo mis amigos
Del valle de Culiacán
Ninguna ley del gobierno
Mi nombre podrá cambiar
Me llamo Pedro Avilés
No se les vaya a olvidar

Knowing that sweet sound will be no more

So long after you've gone 
Oh precious memories that only make me cry

Told me you were her old flame

Than I ever knew before

To buy some cigarettes
And standin' there beside me
Was a gal I'd never met
She pulled out her wallet
And, much to my surprise
There she held your picture, baby
Right before my eyes

That's where they fell in love
When stars above
Came out to play
And now as they wander, their thoughts ever stray

She was a picture in old Spanish lace
Just for a tender while
He kissed the smile
Upon her face
For it was ""Fiesta"" and they were so gay
South of the border, down Mexico way

Then she sighed as she whispered ""ma'ana""
Never dreaming that they were parting
And he lied as he whispered ""ma'ana""
For that tomorrow never came

There in a veil of white
By candlelight
She knelt to pray
The mission bells told him that he mustn't stay

Oh what I'd give, if he'd just come on back home
And call me baby, baby, all night long

He called me baby, baby, all night long

As I watched the mating of the dove
It was in the springtime that you said goodbye

Oh, the wayward wind is a restless wind
A restless wind that yearns to wander
And he was born the next of kin
The next of kin to the wayward wind

In a lonely shack by a railroad track
He spent his younger days
And I guess the sound of the outward bound
Made him a slave to his wand'rin ways

Oh, I met him there in a border town
He vowed we'd never part
Tho' he tried his best to settle down
Now I'm alone with a broken heart

Everybody says I'm crazy
To let you treat me this way
But I can't explain, so, what else can I say
At least I'm on your mind when you're laughin'
Somehow that breaks the fall
So when you need a laugh, give me a call

I'd gladly trade the laugh you get
For making fun of me
To be around the one I love and need so desperately

Where we claimed each other, with tears of joy we cried.
Our friends wished us luck there forever,
As we walked from the church, side by side.

The next scene was a crowded courtroom,
And like strangers we sat side by side.
Then I heard the judge make his decision,
And no longer were we man and wife.

I hate the sight of that courtroom,
Where man-made laws push God's laws aside.
Then the clerk wrote our story in the record ~
A church, a courtroom and then goodbye.

We shook hands and once again we cried.

If I had one wish, I wish I could
Go back to my old neighborhood
Where the good folks they all love you as their own
Then I'd go over to my neighbor's house
Knock on the door 'n they'd all sing out
Come on in and sit right down and make yourself at home

I'd sing their praises long and loud
Cause their all my folks and I'm mighty proud
Of the little old town back home where I was born
I wish that I could hear them say
In the good old-fashioned, friendly way
Come on in and sit right down and make yourself at home

Well, they don't lock their doors at night
'cause they all know they're a-doin' right
And the good lord's bound to have them for his own
If I'd go back to hear them pray
In the little pine church, they all would say
Come on in and sit right down and make yourself at home

When I was a child of only three
I said my prayers at my mother's knee
And I knew right then from god I'd never roam
When I get my summons on the judgment day
I hope I can hear my savior say
Come on in and sit right down and make yourself at home
Now, come on in and sit right down and make yourself at home

And everything went wrong

I watched her take him from me
And his love is no longer my own
Now they are gone
And I sit alone
And watch one cigarette burn away

And his love is no longer my own

Where we claimed each other, with tears of joy we cried.

Our friends wished us luck there forever,
As we walked from the church, side by side.

And like strangers we sat side by side.

Then I heard the judge make his decision,
And no longer were we man and wife.

Where man-made laws push God's laws aside.
Then the clerk wrote our story in the record

I go to church on a Sunday
The vows I make
I break them on Monday
The rest of the week
I do as I please
Then come Sunday morning
I pray on my knees

Chourus:
Dear God I know I'm not Worthy
But I need you so please won't you hurry
And help me turn back from
The path I have trod
You'll never be sorry dear god

Every week
We read in the paper
Of the carrings on
Of some our neighbors
Were lying and cheating
And forgeting our faith
Then we have the nerve
To ask is it to late

He may learn to give his heart for love

Will be memories of paradise

Patsy Watchorn,"In the year of our Lord, eighteen hundred and six
We set sail from the fair Cobh of Cork
We were bound far away with a cargo of bricks
For the fine city hall of New York

In a very fine craft, she was rigged fore-and-aft
And oh, how the wild winds drove her
She had twenty-three masts and withstood several blasts
And we called her the Irish Rover

There was Barney McGee from the banks of the Lee
There was Hogan from County Tyrone
And a chap called McGurk who was scared stiff of work
And a chap from West Meade called Malone

There was Slugger O'Toole who was drunk as a rule
And fighting Bill Casey from Dover
There was Dooley from Claire who was strong as a bear
And was skipper of the Irish Rover

We had one million bales of old billy goats' tails
We had two million buckets of stones
We had three million sides of old blind horses hides
We had four million packets of bones

We had five million hogs, we had six million dogs
And seven million barrels of porter
We had eight million bags of the best Sligo rags
In the hold of the Irish Rover

We had sailed seven years when the measles broke out
And the ship lost her way in a fog
And the whole of the crew was reduced unto two
'Twas myself and the captain's old dog

Then the ship struck a rock with a terrible shock
And then she heeled right over,
Turned nine times around, and the poor dog was drowned

Best killer in the land
Killed women and children
Just as easy as a man

Leave their mangled bodies
Nonchalantly at the door
But now I ain't got the stomach
For killing any more

Made me lots of money
Was the best at my job
Never had to nine to five
Or cheat or steal or rob

Just load up my gun
And leave them on the floor
But now I've lost my taste
For killing any more

Something must be done
But it's all that I can do
What good is an assassin
Who just can't follow through

She took me in her arms
When no one else would have me
Taught me how to throw the blade
And never let 'em have me

Taught me how to shoot so straight
Without a moments skill
She was the most beautiful thing
That I have ever killed

Something must be done
But it's all that I can do

Who just can't follow through

Murdered by the score
Now I just don't think
I can kill any more

I'm my daddy's rising son, world in front of me
But daddy, he ain't smilin' none, what could the problem be?
He just asys ""My foolish one, you live too dangerously""

But, daddy, I ain't hurtin' none, she's spread in front of me
I'd be a fool not to taste the pleasures offered me
But, daddy, he just turns away and locks it with a key
The thirty years years between us must have changed him bitterly

I took my money into town and spread it gingerly
Every table I laid it down, world in front of me
Wine and women, women, wine taste so honey sweet
Every pleasure, overwhelming knocks me off my feet

If anybody crossed my path, I'd cut them down to size
Self-righteousness and forward flow moved me to the prize
I stayed out drinking every night, toasting to the sunrise
I'm my daddy's rising son, won't he be surprised?

All the prophet prophesied my agonized defeat
All the men I trampled on, waited for my sleep
All the women I wronged, waited round with glee
For the big comeuppance that was waiting mad for me

It's the way of this mean world, things ain't really fair
The evil deal out from the bottom without a single care
The goodly try the best they can to hold to what is theirs
The sun, it rises one more day and I'm still standing here

On the way to a wedding on the car radio
And I can't remember words to the verses
But I remember the chorus

And I can't remember who was marrying who
But I'm writing this love song for you

And I hate this motel room, they all smell the same
View of the parking lot etched in my brain
Stuck in this town and you're so far away

I ain't got no paper, I just got this pen
Rip out the back page and write you a hymn

And I took her from her daddy and she left her home behind
I was driving an old blue Belvedere, the seat was pushed way back
And she stared straight out the window as the trees went rushing by

Last night I dreamt of her underwear, the way she smelt in bed
And the way she tossed, way she squirmed
The dreams she might have had

And I think it's sad how her mom and dad don't ever understand
And I think it's sad how her friends all talk
I think it's sad how her friends all talk
I think it's sad how her friends all talk and the hateful things they say

Last night I dreamt of a high school girl, her smile was bright and wide

Uncle Phil smiled as if she'd just done the greatest thing

But I guarantee I understand now
I'm not sure if I understood then
But I guarantee I understand now

My cousin screwed up without a doubt
All of a sudden he wasn't hanging out
And that girl he said, she is the cats
Then he disappeared from sight without a trace

So they had a bunch of babies and they got a good jobs
Working hard to provide the best they can

And I'm not sure if I understood then
But I guarantee I understand now
Not sure if I understood then

Family ties and lips and eyes pass it down, pass it down

Warm and cloudy, cold front coming in around sundown
And I'm walking through your house full of your beautiful relations
And I'm thinking that I'd like to stick around

And there are things I have said with one hand on the Bible
That are only now starting to make sense

Put the gun in his mouth, watched his brains fly out

Got the satisfaction of a job well done
With my own bare hands

Can we still be a part of tomorrow
Do you want me baby, baby
Or is this just a thing of the past

Need to feel your arms around me
I can't stand it whenever you're gone
Ever since the day you found me
I've been hooked on your kiss, but I know now that this

Can't go on
Been watchin' all my dreams slip right away
Seems so wrong
How all the good times live inside of yesterday

Do you love me
Can we still be a part of tomorrow
Do you want me baby, yeah
Or is this just a thing of the past

Said you wouldn't let love burn me
Like a fool I believed it was true
Can't you see just how you hurt me
Got a sensitive heart and it's tearin' apart

Over you
I need to see that sunshine like before
Don't be cruel
Don't give up on the things we've both been livin' for

Do you love me
Can we still be a part of tomorrow
Do you want me baby
Or is this just a thing of the past

Is it so hard to show what you feel
Can't you understand that I still care
You've got to tell me this love is real
Or are tears the only thing we can share

Patti Austin,"Loving you came easily
Yet it made me blind to all there was to see
Now my heart is filled with pain

You understand I never will
How did it come to be that you don't love me still?
Now it's getting to be plain

If you really cared about anyone else
I know you wouldn't hurt me
If you cared about more than yourself
I bet ya wouldn't go
If you really cared about anyone else
I know you wouldn't hurt me
If you cared about more than yourself
You wouldn't walk out the door

Though some days the blues was our parade,
Still we marched through all the tears we made
Now I find that it wasn't no game of charades that you played

I did my best to bring you joy
How can you just leave me like a broken toy?
Where's the man that once was you?

If I could be within your mind
I would never think to treat you this unkind
The pain you caused will come to you",Betcha' Wouldn't Hurt Me,1982
Patti Austin,"Pressure slowly buildin' like a sky about to rain
Somethin' so electric in the air
All this time we’re killin' only leads us back again
To the feeling that’s been waitin’ for us here

It’s too late to be cautious
If it’s a mistake, it’s one we’re meant to make

Shoot the moon
‘Cause one heart is the most we can lose
And if we shoot the moon
There’s no way that the stars can refuse

Feel the tiger stalkin’ in the jungle of the heart
Hungry for the tender and the warm
We can keep on talkin’ but as long as we’re apart
The feelin' just can’t break into a storm

Take a chance when the music is playing
You dance, there’s no reason we can’t

Shoot the moon
‘Cause one heart is the most we can lose
And if we shoot the moon
There’s no way that the stars can refuse

Finding you here
Had the odds of a million to one
And you’re the one
Now, it’s up to us to finish what fate has begun

Take a chance when the music is playing
You dance, there’s no reason we can’t

Shoot the moon
‘Cause one heart is the most we can lose
And if we shoot the moon
There’s no way that the stars can refuse

Shoot the moon
(There’s nothin' standin' in our way)
‘Cause one heart is the most we can lose
And if we shoot the moon
(It’s just the chance we have to take)
There’s no way that the stars can refuse

Right down to the demi-tasse. 
I'm a pot of joy for a hungry boy,

I make the best taxi driver, 
I rate a big Navy ""E""!

Or a pickled beet, 
Step up to my smorgasbord. 
Walk around until

Patti Austin,"It's a lazy afternoon
And the beetle bugs are zooming
And the tulip trees are blooming
And there's not another human in view,
But us two
It's a lazy afternoon
And the farmer leaves his reaping
And the meadow cows are sleeping
And the speckled trouts stop leaping up stream
As we dream
A far pink cloud hangs over the hill
Unfolding like a rose
If you hold my hand and sit real still,
You can hear the grass as it grows
It's a hazy afternoon
And I know a place that's quiet, except for daisies running riot
And there's no one passing by it to see
Come spend this lazy afternoon with me
",Lazy Afternoon,1988
Patti Austin,"VERSE:
The sky may be starless,
The night may be moonless,
But deep in my heart there's a glow.
For deep in my heart
I know that you love me.
You love me because you told me so.

CHORUS:
Love letters straight from your heart
Keep us so near while apart.
I'm not alone in the night
When I can have all the love you write.

*I memorize ev'ry line,
I kiss the name that you sign.
And, darling, then I read again right from the start
Love letters straight from your heart.

I'm so lonely I could cry.

Throw my heart away each Spring
Now a Spring romance
Hasn't got a chance
Promised my first dance to Winter
All I've got to show's a splinter
For my little fling

Spring, this year has got me feeling like a horse
That never left the post
I lay in my room
Starring up at the ceiling
Spring can really hang you up the most

Morning kiss wakes trees and flower
And to them my life
To drink a toast I walk in the park
Just to kill those lonely hours
Spring can really hang you up the most

All afternoon
Those birds tweet-a-tweet I know their tune
This is love this is it
Heard it before
And I know the score
And I decide that love is a bore
Love seem sure around the new year
Now it's April

Love is just a ghost
Spring arrived on time
But what became of you, dear
Spring can really hang you up the most
Spring can really hang you up the most

Spring is here
There's no mistaken
Robins build their nest from coast to coast
My heart tries the same
So they won't hear it breaking
Spring can really hang you up the most

College boys are riding somewhere
... tender passion there it grows
But I'm on the shelf with last years easter bonnet
Spring can really hang you up the most

Love came my way
I'm holding the last
We had our day
Now that's all in the past
Spring came along
A season of song
For love's sweet promise
But something went wrong
Doctor's once prescribed a tonic
Sulfur and molasses was the dose
Didn't help me a bit
My condition must be chronic
Spring can really hang you up the most

All alone, the party's over
Old Man Winter was a gracious host
But when you keep praying
For snow to hide the clover
Spring can really hang you up the most

Patti Austin,"On a night so right for love,
where a silver moon is shining
In the shadow of the willow
I fell for you.

Who could write this storyline
Who could paint this perfect picture
They say love is blind, for us it came as no surprise
You and I had stars in our eyes.

Just a tough or knowing glance
We had learned to trust each other
In the midst of our romance,
we held on so tight

If I had my chance again
maybe I would see the danger
Guess I'd make the same mistakes
It's hard to be young and wise
when all you see is stars in your eyes

On this night I wait alone
from a silver moon I'm minding
Like the shadow or the willow
I weep for you

People say I'm over you
They say times are perfect enough
Why do I still long for you
with stars in my eyes
When I have no tears left to cry
Maybe after all love is blind
Maybe love is blind

There's a special kind of magic in the air
When you find another heart that needs to share

Baby, come to me
Let me put my arms around you
This was meant to be
And I'm oh so glad I found you
Need you everyday
Got to have your love around me
Baby always stay
'Cause I can't go back to livin' without you

Spendin' every dime
To keep you talkin' on the line
That's how it was
And all those walks together
Out in any kind of weather
Just because
There's a brand new way of looking at your life
When you know that love is standing by your side

The night can be cold
There's a chill to every evening when you're all alone
Don't talk anymore
'Cause you know that I'll be here to keep you warm

Baby come to me
Let me put my arms around you
This was meant to be
And I'm so glad I found you
Need you everyday
Got to have your love around me
Baby always stay
'Cause I can't go back to livin' without you.

Baby come to me
Let me put my arms around you

Patti Austin,"How do you keep the music playing?
How do you make it last?
How do you keep the song from fading
Too fast?

How do you lose yourself to someone
And never lose your way?
How do you not run out of new things
To say?

And since you know we're always changing
How can it be the same?

And tell me how year after year
You're sure your heart won't fall apart
Each time you hear his name?

I know the way I feel for you is now or never
The more I love, the more that I'm afraid
That in your eyes I may not see forever, forever

If we can be the best of lovers
Yet be the best of friends
If we can try with every day to make it better as it grows
With any luck than I suppose
The music never ends

I know (how do you keep the music playing)
The way I feel for you is now or never (how do you make it last)
The more I love the more that I'm afraid

That in your eyes I may not see forever

Got a heart just like a stone,
Even ice men leave her alone!

There was Hannah pouring water on a drowning man!

Patti Austin,"For the first time in my life
Boy, I'm not afraid to say it
How I really feel inside
We don't have to go on waiting

Just think about it, together you and I
I could never try to write a better story
From the pages of my life
You must have written for me
'Cause every line, found a way into my heart

So we'll take it one day at a time
And leave all our worries behind
No matter which road that we choose
As long as we got each other
No way we can lose
We can make it through love
Through the test of time

When you look back on the days
When you tried so hard to reach me
But I never saw the way
Till you took the time to teach me
And I found out, what it's all about

So we'll take it one day at a time
And leave all our worries behind
No matter which road that we choose
As long as we got each other
No way we can lose
We can make it through love
Through the test of time

And again I must say
How lucky I feel to have found you
Oh and I pray everyday that this feeling goes on
Forever and ever

So we'll take it one day at a time
And leave all our worries behind
No matter which road that we choose
As long as we got each other
No way we can lose
We can make it through love
Through the test of time

Oh and I pray everyday that this feeling goes on
Forever and ever

So we'll take it one day at a time
And leave all our worries behind
No matter which road that we choose
As long as we got each other
No way we gonna lose
We can make it through love
Through the test of time

We can make it through love
Through the test of time
Through the test of time

Oh if I've got you and you've got me
Then we'll be happy and we can be
If I love you baby and you love me too
Well, there ain't nothing that we can't go for
Through the test of time
Through the test of time
Through the test of time
Through the test of time
Through the test of time

Patti Austin,"How do you keep the music playing?
How do you make it last?
How do you keep the song from fading too fast?
How do you lose yourself to someone?
And never lose your ways
How do you not run out of new things to say?
And since we're always changing
How can it be the same?
And tell me how, year after year
You're sure your heart will fall apart
Each time you hear his name
I know the way I feel for you, it's now or never
The more I love, the more that I'm afraid
That in your eyes I many not see forever, forever

If we can be the best of lovers
Yet be the best of friends
If we can try with everyday to make it bertter as it grows
With any luck, then I suppose, the music never ends

I know the way I feel for you it's now or never!

Heya love love, you little fly lady bug
Come and swing this episode wit more from up above
With them Earl Jeans on fitting tight like a glove
You little Cinnamon Toast Crunch, come show me some love!
Slim goodie got tittle litties
Yeah but she's a picture post card pretty fat kitty little bitty, who!
You're provoking me, giving me the notions
To make me want to lick your funky emotions
She can make a crippled man walk and a blind man see
How can I put this? hmm
She can make the Grinch love Christmas
How can I manifest her uniqueness in vernacular?
(Like a chocolate candy bar) yeah that describes her

I seen her at the park on the black top watching the kids play
Hey style complimented the sunny day
There's a mild nature about her
Gentle but firm for all the bullshit life brought her way
You reflected beauty of a starless night by far
Like Billy Joel said ""I take you just the way you are!""
I had a crush on you since the days of love tap
Karate shoes you had jelly cornrows with the peas in the back
I knew you'd grow to be a fine specimen someday
You the very inspiration for the song I sing
The way you sprint the runway and scale the catwalk
Your life is a movie and the camera's never off
It's like love at first taste, coming deep from within
From your DNA structure to your whole body ova
Your beauty is respected in the eye of the beholder
I love that little chocolate bar tattered on your shoulder

So come a little closer let me kick it in your ear
And share this wit you girl you super official

Ooh la la, ah wee wee, walking by looking all like I Ecstasy
Got doe ma didn't know, good gracious alive!
Aw shuck now, there she go
Hey yo come and rest your feet my little chocolate soufflet
I know you're tired you been running through my mind all day
And Oh My Goodness! can I get a witness?
This roundy brownie is something to see
I never had a craving like this before, I'm addicted

Who delight in panning the dancing teachers,
Let me tell you there are a lot of features
Of the dance that carry you through
The gates of Hea-ven.
It's madness
To be always sitting around in sadness,
When you could be learning the steps of gladness.
You'll be happy when you can do
Just six or seven;
Begin to day!
You'll find it nice,
The quickest way to paradise.
When you practice,
Here's the thing to know,
Simply say as you go

[Chorus]
I'll build a stairway to Paradise
With a new step ev'ry day!
I'm gonna get there at any price;
Stand aside, I'm on my way !
I've got the blues
And up above it's so fair.
Shoes ! Go on and carry me there !
I'll build a stairway to Paradise
With a new step ev'ry day.

Ev'ry new step
Helps a bit ; but any old kind of two step,
Does as well. It don't matter what step you step,
If you work it into your soul
You'll get to Heaven.
Get bu-sy ;
Dance with Maud the countess, or just plain Lizzy:
Dance until you're blue in the face and dizzy.
When you've learn'd to dance in your sleep
You're sure to win out.
In time you'll get Saint Vitus dance,
Which beats the latest thing from France.
Take no chances on this Paradise ;
Let me give you advice.

Low was the moon when we said adios

I know I must go to Torido, that yearning to lose perdido

Without a dream in my heart
Without a love of my own
Blue moon, you knew just what I was there for
You heard me saying a prayer for 
Someone I really could care for
And then there suddenly appeared before me
The only one my arms will ever hold
I heard somebody whisper ""Please adore me""

Keeping danger from a child

Was a little nappy headed boy 
Then my only worry 
Was for Christmas what would be my toy 
Even though we sometimes 
Would not get a thing 
We were happy with the 
Joy the day would bring 
Sneaking out the back door 
To hang out with those hoodlum friends of mine 
Greeted at the back door 
With boy thought I told you not to go outside 
Tryin' your best to bring the 
Water to your eyes 
Thinkin' it might stop her 
From woopin' your behind 
I wish those days could come back once more 
Why did those days ever have to go 
I wish those days could come back once more 
Why did those days ever have to go 
Cause I love them so 
Brother says he's tellin' 
'Bout you playin' doctor with that girl 
Just don't tell I'll give you 
Anything you want in this whole wide world 
Mama gives you money for Sunday school 
You trade yours for candy after church is through 
Smokin' cigarettes and writing something nasty on the wall (you nasty boy) 
Teacher sends you to the principal's office down the wall 
You grow up and learn that kinda thing ain't right 
But while you were doin'it-it sure felt outta sight

Patti Cohenour,"She climbs a tree and scrapes her knee, her dress has got a tear
She waltzes on her way to mass and whistles on the stairs
And underneath her wimple she has curlers in her hair
I've even heard her singing in the abbey

She's always late for chapel but her penitence is real
She's always late for everything except for every meal
I hate to have to say it but I very firmly feel
Maria's not an asset to the abbey

I'd like to say a word in her behalf then say it Sister Margaretta
Maria makes me laugh

How do you solve a problem like Maria?
How do you catch a cloud and pin it down?
How do you find the word that means Maria?
A flibbertigibbet, a willow the wisp, a clown

Many a thing you know you'd like to tell her
Many a thing she ought to understand
But how do you make her stay and listen to all you say
How do you keep a wave upon the sand?

Oh, how do you solve a problem like Maria?
How do you hold a moonbeam in your hand?

When I'm with her I'm confused, out of focus and bemused
And I never know exactly where I am
Unpredictable as weather, she's as flighty as a feather
She's a darling, she's a demon, she's a lamb

She'll out pester any pest, drive a hornet from it's nest
She could throw a whirling dervish out of whirl
She is gentle, she is wild, she's a riddle, she's a child
She's a headache, she's an angel, she's a girl

How do you solve a problem like Maria?
How do you catch a cloud and pin it down?
How do you find the word that means Maria?
A flibbertigibbet, a willow the wisp, a clown

Many a thing you know you'd like to tell her
Many a thing she ought to understand

You and the song are gone
But the melody lingers on

And the melody seemed to say
""Summer will pass away
Take your happiness while you may""

But love would fall to pieces in the rain
Who would know better than you

With nothing so rare as the love that it brings

For the simple daughter of a simple man

I was kissed by my sisters, my cousins, and my aunties.
Sad to tell, it was hell, an inferno worse than Dante's.

And some thrills I can't define.
Listen, sweet, I repeat,

Finding another world.

And I roamed the world free
To the east with a long 
To the west with a sea
And I searched all the earth
And I scanned all the skies

In my own true love's eyes

You really ought to know
For every thing you taught her
Don't matter when she's all alone

After all of us told her, ?No?
S-s-she'd get another spoon ball
Now, she's going no where slow

Her papa caught her for the first time
And put her out on the street
Cara told me to remind him
That she was only seventeen

Yo, mister how's your daughter? how's your girl?
You really ought to know
Every thing you taught her
It don't matter when she's all alone

Cara got hooked up with the wrong kids
Then s-s-she started skipping school
Then Cara got high to make disappear
A world full of fools

In her eyes her father was the biggest fool of them all
And she was speeding, that's what she?d say
Maybe, maybe, maybe she wouldn't talk so stupid
If she knew how much she needed this fool today

Yo, mister how's your daughter?
You really ought to know
For every thing you taught her
Don't matter when she's all alone

She needs you right now mister
?Cause she ain't got long to live
It?s so easy to say, ?I love you?
But it?s harder to forgive

Her father cried when I told him that Cara twice got knocked up
He said, ?Just like her mama, aha, she shows her body
When she wants to show love, she tried that stuff with me
And I beat her down, there's no way I could let her stay
Couldn't let her stick around ?

?Cause I tried so hard to raise her right
He said, ?What made her turn out this way?, I don't know
What made her turn out this way, I don't know, I don't know

I'm saving it, your love to me
A sentimental love tonight to me
Every time it is when you love somebody

No tears, no signs
Only makes it so much harder to go on
Just take good care
And remember when you're feeling all alone

You'll be with me in my heart
And always on my mind
The only thing that keeps us apart is time

When you love somebody
Who makes you feel so glad
When you need somebody
You need your love just as bad

It's time for a promise
Never to be untrue
Until we're together
I'm saving my love for you

When we're, our two
And I felt that I've known you for so long
One thing, I knew
It was lovin' that would last on and on

Even with the best of plans
The world gets in the way
Don't be downhearted
I'll soon be back to stay

When you love somebody
Who makes you feel so glad
When you need somebody
You need your love just as bad

It's time for a promise
Never to be untrue
Until we're together

And I would be a fool to throw away my chances
The best shot that I ever had

And all that we could have
One of those romances
That's warmer with the good times
And grows stronger with the bad

Ooh Lord, I'm saving it
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

When you love somebody
Who makes you feel so glad
When you need somebody
You need your love just as bad

Ooh baby, I'm saving it
Yes, that's all I wanna do, just save it
All I wanna do, sweet thing, is save it

Only thing I want to do is save it

And we just pretend it all away
We act like nothing's changed
But in our hearts we know, it's not the same, oh, no

'Cause we're not makin' love anymore
Baby, we're not makin' love like before
We may hold each other tight

But we're not makin' love

Remember when you couldn't wait to run into my arms
When the love inside my heart was all you needed
Remember when you made me wish the night would never end
The fire, the thunder, we lived to love each other

If ever two hearts were one, then it was yours and mine
But that was another place in time
Now all we have to show
Are memories of a dream we used to know

You'll come and find the place where I am lying,

Well, you still make me laugh
Not as often maybe as in the past
Still enough for me to stand around
Don't you question, I don't question what I've found

With your hand upon my heart
You make me stronger than I thought I could be
When the world desires to tear us apart
I put my hand upon your heart

Sometimes we're forced to sail
In troubled waters, if the wind does prevail
Hmm, it?s not good enough, no, not good enough, you see
Oh, but it?s good enough for me

With your hand upon my heart
You make me stronger than I thought I could be
When the world desires to tear us apart
I put my hand upon your heart

And if we lose the light, well, do we have to see
For in perpetual night, I feel you here with me

I feel your hand upon my heart
I feel your hand, I feel you hand
You make me braver than I ever should be
You make me strong

And if the world would dare to tear us apart
You'll be right here, I feel your hand upon my heart
I feel, I feel your
I feel your hand upon my heart

You said that you loved me; said hurt only came to pass me.
It sounded so convincing that I gave it half a chance

Ceased to be a mystery

And I know, what you've been through
I will be your friend, lean on me for now
Got to pull you back up, somehow

And I’ll, have no more of this, moping around
I’m tired of you, putting yourself down
'Cos in spite of all, you've been through
I still believe, there's a winner in you

Sometimes you can see it on the tip of your mind
But can't focus at all times
Then the wind takes it to another
Before you discover

There's a winner, there's a hero
There's a lover too, somewhere, there's a winner in you

And I'll, have no more of this, moping around
I'm tired of you, putting yourself down
'Cos in spite of all, you've been through
I still believe, there's a winner in you

There's a winner, there's a hero
There's a lover too, somewhere, there's a winner in you

There's a winner, there's a hero
There's a lover too, somewhere, there's a winner in you

On the black satin sheets oh I swear he started to freak

Hey, hey, hey
Touching her skin feelin' silky smooth
The colour of cafe au lait
Made the savage beast inside
Roar until it cried, more, more, more

Now he's back home doing nine to five
Living his grey flannel life
But when he turns off to sleep
Old memories creep, more, more, more

Patti LaBelle,"If we are one big happy family, no one would have to beg to eat.
If we live in a world of dignity, no man would have to live on the street.
If I tell you you're a part of me, there's no need for disbelief.
H ere is my hand, to let you know that what we dream weall can hold.
Apart we are weak....together we're strong.

[Chorus]
Oh, people....we are writing this song. We're all living these words together forever.
There's no reason we can't live and be one...
Build the world that we want together.
For as long as you stand here by me... we'll live on.

Think of all the possibilities that the eyes of a child can see.
Think of all the opportunities that float right by you and me.

And when I lose my will you'll be there to push me up the hill.
There's no, no looking back for us, we got love sure 'nough, that's enough.

Stand by you like a tree, dare anybody to try and move me.
Darlin' in you I found strength where I was torn down
Don't know what's in store but together we can open any door.
Just to do what's good for you and inspire you a little higher.
I know you can make a man out of a soul that didn't have a goal.

Patti LaBelle,"The first Noel the angels did say
Was to certain poor shepherds
In fields as they lay,
In fields where they lay
Keeping their sheep
On a cold winter's night
That was so deep.
Noel Noel Noel Noel!
Born is the King of Israel!

They looked up and saw a star
Shining in the East beyond them far,
And to the earth it gave great light,
And so it continued both day and night.
Noel Noel Noel Noel!
Born is the King of Israel!

And by the light of that same star
Three wise men came from country far,
To seek for a King was their intent
And to follow the star
Wherever it went.
Noel Noel Noel Noel!
Born is the King of Israel!

This star drew nigh to the northwest
Over Bethlehem it took its rest,
And there it did both stop and stay
Right over the place where Jesus lay.
Noel Noel Noel Noel!
Born is the King of Israel!

Then did they know assuredly
Within that house the King did lie:
One entered in then for to see,
And found the Babe in poverty:
Noel Noel Noel Noel!
Born is the King of Israel!

Then entered in those wise men three
Full reverently upon their knee,
And offered there in His presence
Their gold, and myrrh and frankincense.
Noel Noel Noel Noel!
Born is the King of Israel!

Then let us all with one accord
Sing praises to our heavenly Lord,
That hath made heaven
And earth of naught
And with His blood
Mankind hath bought.

Patti LaBelle,"It came upon a midnight clear that glorious song of old
From angels bending near the earth to touch their harps of gold
Peace on the earth goodwill to men from heaven all gracious 
King
The world in solemn stillness lay to hear the angels sing

For lo the days are hastening on by prophets seen of old
When with the ever circling years shall come the time foretold
When the new heaven and earth shall on the Prince of peace 
their king
And the whole world send back the song which now the angels 
sing

Still through the cloven skies they come with peaceful wings 
unfurled
And still their heavenly music floats o'er all the weary world
Above its sad and lowly plains they bend on hovering wing
And ever o'er its Babel sounds the blessed angels sing

Yet with the woes of sin and strife the world has suffered long
Beneath the heavenly strain have rolled two thousand years of 
wrong
And man at war with man hears not the tidings which they bring
O hush the noise ye men of strife and hear the angels sing

O ye, beneath life's crushing load whose forms are bending low
Who toil along the climbing way with painful steps and slow
Look now for glad and golden hours come swiftly on the wing
O rest beside the weary road and hear the angels sing

For lo the days are hastening on by prophets seen of old
When with the ever circling years shall come the time foretold
When peace shall over all the earth its ancient splendors fling
And the whole world give back the song which now the angels sing",It Came Upon a Midnight Clear,1998

Above thy deep and dreamless sleep the silent stars go by

While mortals sleep the angels keep their watch of wondering love
Oh morning stars together, proclaim thy holy birth.
And praises sing to God the king, and peace to men on earth.

To see what I could see

And told his plans to me, so

Better not pout, I'm telling you why

Gonna find out who's naughty and nice

He sees you when you're sleepin'
He knows when you're a wake
He knows if you've been bad or good
So be good for goodness sake

And curly head dolls that toddle and coo
Elephants, boats, and kiddie cars too
Santa Claus is comin' to town
Then kids in Girl and Boy land will have a jubilee
They're gonna build a Toyland all around the Christmas tree
So! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why

Now Santa is a busy man, He has no time to play
He's got millions of stockings to fill on Christmas day
You'd better write your letter now
And mail it right away
Because he's getting ready
His reindeer's and his sleigh. So

As the dawn of salvation draws near,

From the heavens' golden height
Shows the grace of His holy might

Of His fatherly love us graced

Since times of our fathers He hath
Promised to spare all mankind!

In the lane, snow is glistening

We're happy tonight,

Gone away is the bluebird,
Here to stay is a new bird

As we go along,
Walking in a winter wonderland.

In the meadow we can build a snowman,
Then pretend that he is Parson Brown
He'll say: Are you married?
We'll say: No man,
But you can do the job
When you're in town.

Later on, we'll conspire,
As we dream by the fire
To face unafraid,
The plans that we've made,
Walking in a winter wonderland.

In the meadow we can build a snowman,
And pretend that he's a circus clown
We'll have lots of fun with mister snowman,
Until the other kids knock him down.

When it snows, ain't it thrilling,
Though your nose gets a chilling
We'll frolic and play, the Eskimo way,

I doubt if she'd ever do it again
Would she even care

You break your back and you break your legs
And you break your faith

So you say to yourself, ""Is it something I said?
Is it something I done, is it the way I look?
Is it the way my clothes come unfasten?""

Then you ain't worth me anyway
Screams so you fasten your clothes
You check your speech and you check you drag

Because if you think your lonely now
Wait until tonight comes
'Cause I'll be somewhere, somewhere, somewhere
I ain't gonna stop and try to prove myself to you

Because you ain't gonna, you ain't gonna
You ain't gonna, know me

Turn the lights down, tune the world out?

Let me take you to a place you've
Never been before open up a door

To a dream come true
Take my hand
And show me how to

Make tonight beautiful

Patti LaBelle,"Don't you know, so many things they come and go
Like your words that once rang true
Just like the love I thought I found in you
And I remember the thunder, talkin' 'bout the fire in your eyes
But you walked away when I needed you most

Now maybe, baby, maybe, baby, I found someone
To take away the heartache, to take away the loneliness
I've been feelin' since you've been gone, since you've been gone

Dry your eyes. I never could bear to see you cry
Someday your love will shine through
And show you the feelings you never really knew
But, baby, don't ya lose that thunder, talkin' 'bout the fire in your eyes
You're lookin' at me but you still don't believe

That maybe, baby, maybe, baby, I found someone
To take away the heartache, to take away the loneliness
I've been feelin' since you've been gone, since you've been gone

Too long on the border line, wonderin' if your love was really mine
But you left me with open eyes, and when I realized, baby
I found someone to take away the heartache
To take away the loneliness I've been feelin' since you've been gone
Baby I found someone to take away the heartache
To take away the loneliness I've been feelin' since you've been gone",I Found Someone,2003
Patti LaBelle,"You are the candle, love's the flame
A fire that burns through wind and rain
Shine your light on this heart of mine
Till the end of time
You came to me like the dawn through the night
Just shinin' like the sun
Out of my dreams and into my life
You are the one, you are the one

[Chorus]
Said I loved you but I lied
'Cause this is more than love I feel inside
Said I loved you but I was wrong
'Cause love could never ever feel so strong
Said I loved you but I lied

With all my soul I've tried in vain
How can mere words my heart explain
This taste of heaven so deep so true
I've found in you
So many reasons in so many ways
My life has just begun
Need you forever, I need you to stay
You are the one, you are the one

You came to me like the dawn through the night

Patti LaBelle,"We may be strangers
We may be worlds apart somehow
And it's hard to accept
The things we just don't understand
So blind to each other
We only see one side of nowhere
Some things we may never know
If there's one thing you should ever know

Soul of my soul, heart of my heart
The greatest treasure of my life that's what you are
Soul of my soul, child of my heart
I love you more than you know, soul of my soul

Into this world
We come with a heart that's open wide
And the best of this life
Is all I ever want for you
The love you believe in, your every dream
Your every passion
In time I know you'll come to see
Nothin' means as much to me

Soul of my soul, heart of my heart
The greatest treasure of my life that's what you are
Soul of my soul, child of my heart
I love you more than you know, soul of my soul

There'll come a time when you'll be on your own
But in your heart you're never far from home
Eery road you take
Your ever living day
You will always be, you will always be
The soul of my soul

Soul of my soul, heart of my heart
The greatest treasure of my life that's what you are
Soul of my soul, child of my heart
I love you more than you know, soul of my soul

Some kind of miracle of my life that's what you are
Blood of my blood, light of my life
You mean much more than you know

Patti LaBelle,"[Intro: DMX]
Uh! (Our father) I'm a talk this (Who art in heaven)
Start walk this

[Verse 1: DMX]
In the name of Jesus
I can have everything good of the earth be given to me by him
In the name of Jesus
There would be never be a time that I have to fight the devil and I cannot win
In the name of Jesus
I lose all strong holds that the devil had over my life
In the name of Jesus
When I save a thousand two or save ten
So I thank the lord for my wife
In the name of Jesus
I want to thank you what you showed me what you told me
In the name of Jesus
I want to thank you for your love and watchin over me
In the name of Jesus
I don't have to, go through what I went through anymore
In the name of Jesus
I don't have to (What!) now that I got you in my life ever more (Come on!)

[Chorus: Patti LaBelle]
I know it cannot happen without you, you you, without you, oh, oh oh oh
Without you

[Verse 2: DMX]
In the name of Jesus
You gave me the book, so now I just look when I need the word
In the name of Jesus
You took, a crook, gave him a new look now he speaks the word
In the name of Jesus
It don't matter what we did tell it to the lord and he forgives
Whatever it was right or wrong
I'm a catch up with the herd then I'm comin home
In the name of Jesus
I ran away for far too long starve too long
In the name of Jesus
Where people perish for lack of knowledge
They all too strong let's get it on
In the name of Jesus
I realize I'm a sinner
I repent my sins and right this moment am a beginner
Baby in the spirit, let me go
In the name of Jesus please let me go!!!! (Come on!)

[Chorus: Patti LaBelle]
I know it cannot happen without you, you you, without you, oh, oh oh oh
Without you

[Bridge: DMX + (Patti LaBelle)]
I gotta say what's on my mind (Say what's on your mind)
You saved my life a thousand times (Saved a thousand times)
Gave me a dream that came to be
Opened my eyes so I could see

[DMX & Patti LaBelle]
I had my ups and had my downs
Until you turned my life around
And I want the whole world to see
They don't know what you mean to me

[Verse 3: DMX]
In the name of Jesus
All praises due to the shepherd watchin the flock of sheep
In the name of Jesus
Ain't even about where I'm steppin
You watch in the dark when I'm sleep

I know it cannot happen without you, you you, without you, oh, oh oh oh

Working for a living sometimes the road gets hard
With the first snowflakes of winter
My heart goes straight back home
To the days when I was little before life on my own

Nothing could be better than the Christmas here with you
Family joined together, loved ones old and new
As we gather here, the season's cheer
Makes my yuletide wish come true
Nothing could be better than Christmas here with you

Christmas Eve is special, it's music to my ears
Singing 'round the fire, we chose the coming year
Carols in the distance, faces full of joy
It's a Merry Christmas, in wonder we rejoice

Nothing could be better than the Christmas here with you
Family joined together, loved ones old and new
As we gather here, the season's cheer
Makes my yuletide wish come true

The light shining back at me

Darling

I used to think that we were always gonna be in love
But I was so naive back then I wasn't wise enough
To know there ain't nothing in this life that's guaranteed
You take your chances when you let your heart lead

And heaven knows how much I wanted to keep loving you
You let me down when you said some things that were untrue
So I'm giving you up 'cause there ain't enough love in this world
To change my mind, we're out of time, the dream is over

I've got my reasons for the way that I feel
Suffered in silence when I had to conceal
My honest emotions, truth must be revealed
Might not be right but I've just got to be real

We could go on forever never really letting go
What's the sense in that when in our hearts we knew
This isn't working, we're on a dead end road
Don't think my back can stand the weight of the load

And while it's hard for me to admit we made a mistake
I can't pretend no more, it's too much to take
Time for moving on, I said all I have to say
Won't live a lie, this is goodbye, the dream is over now

I've got my reasons for the way that I feel
Suffered in silence when I had to conceal
My honest emotions, truth must be revealed
Might not be right but I've just got to be real

And as I walk away though I'm leaving with tears and regrets
There are memories of you I will never forget
But it's time for me to do what my heart tells me to
I have to be strong but right or wrong, I'll always love you

I've got my reasons for the way that I feel
Suffered in silence when I had to conceal
My honest emotions, truth must be revealed

There's something you gotta know

There's no in between, not for you

So when everything's not enough
Maybe he's just not the one

Sometimes love has to change
Sometimes the heart has to break

Sometimes love's not the way
That you thought it would be
Sometimes you just got to leave
But you're not the only one
That's been hurt by love
When you love someone it's natural
To have second thoughts, should you go
It's not easy girl, being strong
You keep wondering if you were wrong

Patti LaBelle,"It's a little bit funny this feeling inside 
I'm not one of those who can easily hide 
I don't have much money but boy if I did 
I'd buy a big house where we both could live 
If I was a sculptor but then again no 
Or a man who makes potions in a traveling show 
Oh I know it's not much but it's the best I can do 

My gift is my song 
And this one's for you 
And you can tell everybody this is your song 
It may be quite simple but now that it's done 
I hope you don't mind 
I hope you don't mind 
That I put down in words 

How wonderful life is while you're in the world 
I sat on the roof and kicked off the moss 
Well a few of the verses well they've got me quite cross 
But the sun's been quite kind 
While I wrote this song 
It's for people like you that 
Keep it turned on 
So excuse me forgetting 

But these things I do 
You see I've forgotten 
If they're green or they're blue 
Anyway the thing is what I really mean 
Yours are the sweetest eyes I've ever seen 
And you can tell everybody this is your song 
It may be quite simple but 
Now that it's done 

I hope you don't mind 
I hope you don't mind 
That I put down in words

Patti LaBelle,"She's a fool and don't I know it
But a fool can have her charms
I'm in love and don't I show it
Like a babe in arms

Love's the same old situation
Lately I've not slept a wink
Since this crazy situation
Has me on the blink

I'm wild again, beguiled again
A whimpering, simpering child again
Bewitched, bothered and bewildered - am I

Couldn't sleep, wouldn't sleep
Love came and told me, shouldn't sleep
Bewitched, bothered and bewildered - am I

I lost my heart, but what of it
She is cold I agree
She might laugh, but I love it
Although the laugh's on me

I'll sing to her, bring spring to her
And long, for the day when I'll cling to her
Bewitched, bothered and bewildered - am I",Bewitched,2005

Just to hear the words I do 
All of my life I want to be

With this ring we go our way
For better or worse I take thee wed
By your hand I will be led

Through the years we'll live in bliss
Life will be full of happiness
Oh chimes from the church bells will ring
With each hour they'll be rippling

Something borrowed, something blue
I am yours to cherish and behold
With this little band of gold",Down the Aisle (The Wedding Song),2005
Patti LaBelle,"I remember when
I was five and you were ten, boy
You knew that I was shy
So you teased and made me cry
But I loved you

Then one day you came
You told me you were leaving
You gave your folks the blame
And made me cry again
When you said

Little girl
Please don't wait for me
Wait patiently for love
Someday will surely come
Ooh, little girl
Please don't wait for me
Wait patiently for love
Someday will surely come
And I'm still waiting

I'm waiting
Ooh, still waiting
I'm just a fool
Ooh, I'm a fool
To keep waiting

Then someone finally came
He told me that he loved me
I put him off with lies
He could see I had no eyes
So he left me once again alone
Like a child without her playmate
I had to face the truth
I was still in love with you
But you said:

Little girl
Please don't wait for me
Wait patiently for love
Someday will surely come
Ooh, little girl
Please don't wait for me
Wait patiently for love
Someday will surely come
And I'm still waiting

Love has never shown his face
Since the day you walked out that door
You filled my life with empty space
Come back
Can't you see it's you I'm waiting for

Don't you know I'm waiting
I'm waiting for love
For you, I miss you
I'm waiting

I want you

With thoughts as bold as thought can be

In simplicity.

Sickness will surely take the mind
Where minds can't usually go.
Come on the amazing journey
And learn all you should know.

A vague haze of delerium
creeps up on me.
All at once a tall stranger I suddenly see.
He's dressed in a silver sparked

Glittering gown
And His golden beard flows
Nearly down to the ground.
Nothing to say and nothing to hear

And nothing to see.
Each sensation makes a note in my symphony.
Sickness will surely take the mind
Where minds can't usually go.

Come on the amazing journey
And learn all you should know.
His eyes are the eyes that
Transmit all they know.

Sparkle warm crystalline glances to show
That he is your leader
And he is your guide
On the amazing journey together you'll ride.

From Soho down to Brighton I must have played them all.
But I ain't seen nothing like him, In any amusement hall.

He stands like a statue, becomes part of the machine.
Feeling all the bumpers, always playing clean.
He plays by intuition, The digit counters fall.
That deaf dumb and blind kid, Sure plays a mean pinball.
He's a pinball wizard
There has got to be a twist.
A pin ball wizard,
S'got such a supple wrist.
'How do you think he does it? I don't know.
What makes him so good?'
He ain't got no distractions, Can't hear no buzzers and bells,
Don't see lights a flashin', plays by sense of smell.
Always has a replay, 'n' never tilts at all.
That deaf dumb and blind kid, Sure plays a mean pinball.
I thought I was the Bally table king.
But I just handed my pin ball crown to him.
Even my usual table, He can beat my best.
His disciples lead him in, and he just does the rest.
He's got crazy flipper fingers, never seen him fall.

I have my pride, but I'd rather be with you tonight

So much emotion, it's driving me mad
But I'll take my chances with these feelings that I have
And I'll come back to this same corner where we met
And I'll be here every year, every Christmas

Mere words can't explain the pain and the fear
'Cause oh, I wonder, yes, I wonder are you gonna leave me standing here
Today's almost over, but I don't want to leave
Has my heart made a fool out of me?

My friends gather round me with holiday cheer
They say to forget you, to let you go 'cause you're not here
Well, I can't keep explaining what they'll never understand
And why I'm here every year, every Christmas
I return every year, every Christmas
I come here every year, every Christmas","Every Year, Every Christmas",2007
Patti LaBelle,"The holidays mean more to me
Than sending cards and shopping sprees
It's the time we connect
With our family and friends
The holidays, the holidays

Holidays mean more to me
Than mistletoe and Christmas trees
It's the smile we create
For the little baby's face
The holidays, the holidays

Holidays, a time for giving
Celebrating love and living
Memories and joy along the way

The holidays mean more to me
Than getting gifts from somebody
It's the stars in the sky
It's the birth of Christ

Oh, the holidays, a time for giving
Celebrating love and living
Memories and joy along the way

Holidays mean more to me
It's Christmas

Oh, holidays mean more to me
Than telling Santa Claus, our wants and needs
It's a time to give thanks
For God's amazing grace

Celebrating love and living

Patti LaBelle,"No way, no pressure
Yes, I know it's Christmas Eve
And we don't even have a tree
Don't rush to get me a present
Your presence is enough for me
Stay at home, I'll be happy

'Cause I ain't gonna miss something
That was never here

Holidays make you care enough
To give me gifts, I don't need that stuff
Baby, what I want, you can't wrap it up
'Cause as long as I know I have your love

It's a Merry Christmas, yes, it is
It's a Merry Christmas

No, I'm not Santa Claus
But I wanna spread some Christmas glitter
To someone in a world of need
So extend your love and blessings
To those less fortunate than you and me
Your presence is enough for me

'Cause I ain't gonna miss something
That was never here

Oh, holidays make you care enough
To give me gifts, I don't need that stuff
Baby, what I want, you can't wrap it up
Just as long as I have your love

There was a time
That all I did was [Incomprehensible]
Oh, but all those material things
It was just false happiness

So I learned not to put love
After things that you have
Now it's so easy to see
That the best things in life
Should always be free
Why should we pay for something we just don't need?

[Incomprehensible]
It's gonna be a Merry Christmas
Just you and me
It's gonna be a Merry Christmas
Just you and me

It's gonna be a Merry, Merry Christmas

When friends come to call
It's the hap-happiest season of all

And caroling out in the snow
There'll be scary ghost stories and tales of the glories
Of Christmases long ago, ooh

Need you?

Than in the bed at night.

Then why you run the streets with a hood girl?

You better straighten up

I put him off with lies

I was still in love with you

Was to certain poor shepherds in fields as they lay:
In fields where they lay a-keeping their sheep
On a cold winter's night that was so deep.
Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel,
Born is the King of Israel.

They looked up and saw a star,
Shining in the east, beyond them far:
And to the earth it gave great light,
And so it continued both day and night.
Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel,
Born is the King of Israel.

And by the light of that same star
Three wise men came from the country far;
To seek for a King was their intent,
And to follow the star wherever it went.
Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel,
Born is the King of Israel.

This star drew nigh to the north-west;
O'er Bethlehem it took its rest,
And there it did both stop and stay,
Right over the place where Jesus lay.
Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel,
Born is the King of Israel.

Then entered in those wise men three,
Fell reverently upon their knee,
And offered there in his presence
Their gold and myrrh and frankincense.
Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel,
Born is the kind of Israel.

Then let us all with one accord
Sing praises to our heavenly Lord,
That hath made heaven and earth of nought,
And with his blood mankind has bought.

That glorious song of old,
From angels bending near the earth,
To touch their harps of gold:

From heav'n's all-gracious King.
The world in solemn stillness lay,
To hear the angels sing!

Beneath the angel strain have rolled
Two thousand years of wrong;
And man, at war with man, hears not
The love song which they bring:
O hush the noise, ye men of strife,
And hear the angels sing!

Still thro' the cloven skies they come,
With peaceful wings unfurl'd;
And still their heav'nly music floats
O'er all the weary world:
Above its sad and lowly plains
They bend on hov'ring wing,
And ever o'er its Babel sounds
The blessed angels sing.

All ye, beneath life's crushing load,
Whose forms are bending low,
Who toil along the climbing way
With painful steps and slow,
Look, now! for glad and golden hours
Come swiftly on the wing:
O rest beside the weary road,
And hear the angels sing!

For lo! the days are hast'ning on,
By prophet bards foretold,
When with the ever-circling years
Comes round the age of gold;
When peace shall over all the earth
Its ancient splendors fling,
And the whole world give back the song

How can one person like me, say
Alter the time-honored way the game is played?

Fundamental system of government, quite incidental
So what are my chances of honest advances? I'd say low
Better to win by admitting my sin than to lose with a halo

Tell me before I seek worthier pastures and thereby restore self-esteem
How can you be so short-sighted
To look never further than this week or next week
Than have no impossible dream?

Allow me before you slink off to the sidelines
I'll pay your fair gift three cheers but first tell me who'd be delighted
To witness me the top world's greatest problems
From war to pollution, no hope of solution

You can bet your life it rains. 
Tried to give a party 
But the guy upstairs complains. 
Guess I'll go through life 
Catching colds and missing trains. 
Everything happens to me. 

I never miss a thing 
I've had the measles and the mumps. 
And every time I play an ace 
My partner always trumps. 
Guess I'm just a fool 
Who never looks before he jumps. 
Everything happens to me. 

At first I thought that you would end this jinx for me. 
And love would turn the trick to end despair. 
Now I just cant fool this head that thinks for me. 
I've mortgaged all my castles in the air.

Patti LuPone,"There was a time when men were kind
Their voices were soft
And their words inviting

There was a time when love was blind
And the world was a song
And that song was exciting

There was a time, and it all went wrong

I dreamed a dream in days gone by
When hope was high and life worth living
I dreamed that love would never die
I dreamed that God would be forgiving

Then I was young and unafraid
And dreams were made and used and wasted
There was no ransom to be paid
No song unsung no wine untasted

But the tigers come at night
With their voices soft as thunder
As they tear your hope apart
As they turn your dream to shame

He slept a summer by my side
He filled my days with endless wonder
He took my childhood in his stride
But he was gone when autumn came

And still I dreamed he'd come to me
That we would live the years together
But there are dreams that cannot be
And there are storms we cannot weather

I had a dream my life would be
So diff'rent from this hell I'm living
So diff'rent now from what it seemed
Now life has killed the dream I dreamed",I Dreamed a Dream,1993
Patti LuPone,"I used to visit all the very gay places
Those come what may places
Where one relaxes on the axis of the wheel of life
To get the feel of life
From jazz and cocktails.
The girls I knew had sad and sullen gray faces
With distant gay traces
That used to be there you could see where they'd been washed away
By too many through the day
Twelve o'clock tales
Then you came along with your siren of song
To tempt me to madness!
I thought for a while that your poignant smile was tinged with the sadness
Of a great love for me.

Ah yes! I was wrong
Again,
I was wrong.
Life is lonely again,
And only last year everything seemed so sure.
Now life is awful again,
A troughful of hearts could only be a bore.
A week in Paris will ease the bite of it,
All I care is to smile in spite of it.
I'll forget you, I will
While yet you are still burning inside my brain.
Romance is mush,
Stifling those who strive.
I'll live a lush life in some small dive
And there I'll be, while I rot
With the rest of those whose lives are lonely, too",Lush Life,1993
Patti LuPone,"When I was a girl l I had a favorite story 
Of the meadowlark who lived where the rivers wind 
Her voice could match the angels' in its glory 
But she was blind, the lark was blind
An old king came and took her to his palace 
Where the walls were burnished bronze and golden braid 
And he fed her fruit and nuts from an ivory chalice 
And he prayed: 

""Sing for me, my meadowlark, 
Sing for me of the silver morning,
Set me free, my meadowlark, 
And I'll buy you a priceless jewel 
And cloth of brocade and crewel 
And I'll love you for life, 
If you will sing for me.""

Then one day as the lark sang by the water 
The god of the sun heard her in his flight 
And her singing moved him so 
He came and brought her the gift of sight
He gave her sight 
And she opened her eyes to the shimmer and the splendor 
Of this beautiful, young god, so proud and strong
And he called to the lark in a voice both rough and tender
""Come along. 
Fly with me, my meadowlark,
Fly with me on the silver morning,
Past the sea where the dolphins bark
We will dance on the coral beaches,
Make a feast of the plums and peaches 
Just as far as your vision reaches 
Fly with me.""

But the meadowlark said no
For the old king loved her so 
She couldn't bear to wound his pride
So the sun god flew away 
And when the king came down that day 
He found his meadowlark had died
Every time I heard that part I cried 

And now I stand here starry-eyed and stormy 
Oh, just when I thought my heart was finally numb 
A beautiful, young man appears before me, 
Singing â??come, oh, won't you come?â??
And what can I do if finally for the first time 
The one I'm burning for returns the glow? 
If love has come at last it's picked the worst time
Still I know
I've got to go

Fly away, meadowlark 
Fly away in the silver morning, 
If I stay, I'll grow to curse the dark 
So it's off where the days won't bind me 
I know I leave wounds behind me 
But I won't let tomorrow find me 
Back this way 
Before my past once again can blind me 
Fly away
And we won't wait 
To say good-bye 
My beautiful young man 
And I.",Meadowlark,1993

And put you through hell
And give you support for being alive-being alive

That I always have found it best, 
Instead of getting 'em off my chest, 
To let 'em rest unexpressed,

And dreams were made and used and wasted
There was no ransom to be paid
No song unsung no wine untasted

But the tigers come at night
With their voices soft as thunder
As they tear your hope apart
As they turn your dream to shame

He slept a summer by my side
He filled my days with endless wonder
He took my childhood in his stride
But he was gone when autumn came

And still I dreamed he'd come to me
That we would live the years together
But there are dreams that cannot be
And there are storms we cannot weather

I had a dream my life would be
So diff'rent from this hell I'm living
So diff'rent now from what it seemed
Now life has killed the dream I dreamed",I Dreamed A Dream [From Les Misérables],2003

Look, you don’t need to be a genius to see
That I was givin’ you the yank yank

What else did you BS me about?
Well, since you asked

To grab a couple boozers with a pal?
Yeah, you had a friend from college that you had to meet
Nah, I was at the women’s shoe store lookin’ at feet

Jack Frost nipping at your nose
Yule-tide carols being sung by a choir
And folks dressed up like Eskimos.

Everybody knows a turkey and some mistletoe
Help to make the season bright
Tiny tots with their eyes all aglow
Will find it hard to sleep tonight.

They know that Santa's on his way
He's loaded lots of toys and goodies on his sleigh
And every mother's child is gonna spy
To see if reindeer really know how to fly.

In the city's dust you wait, must you wait
Just you wait.......!

In a mountain greenery,
Where god paints the scenery
Just two crazy people together.

While you love your lover,
Let blue skies, be your cover-let,
When it rains we'll laugh at the weather.

And if you're good,
I'll search for wood,
So you can cook... while i stand look-in'

Beans could get no keener reception in a beanery

But nevertheless I'm in love with you

Somehow, I know at a glance, the terrible chances I'm taking
Fine at the start, then left with a heart that is breaking

Maybe I'll live a life of regret, 
And maybe I'll give much more than I get
But nevertheless, I'm in love with you

In spite of all I could do
I went ahead falling for you

Of a down-hearted frail
And they played that
As part of the blues

Out on a hill

Pushed it through a horn
Til it was worn

Met a girl with a drink in her hand
She had ruby red lips, coal black hair
And eyes that would tempt any man.

As she placed her soft hands in mine
I found myself wanting to kiss her
For temptation was flowing like wine.

And I was almost persuaded to strip myself of my pride
Almost persuaded to push my conscience aside
Then we danced and she whispered, ""I need you,
Take me away from here and be my man.""

Cause lies cannot hold water and you'll sink into the sea

[Chorus]

I know it isn't easy to resist temptation's call
But think of how your broken heart will hurt you when you fall
Cause some day you will find that you are hopelessly in love
And she'll belong to someone else as sure as stars above

Patti Page,"On a quiet street
In the city
A littleold man walked along
Shufflin' thru the autumn afternoon
And the autumn leaves reminded him
Another summer's come and gone
He had a lonely night ahead
Waitin' for June

Then among the leaves
Near the orphan's home
A piece of paper caught his eye
And he stooped to pick it up with trembling hands
As he read the childish writing
The old man began to cry
'Cause the words burned inside of him
Like a brand

Whoever finds this I love you
Whoever finds this I need you
I ain't even got no one to talk to
So whoever finds this I love you

The old man's eyes searched the orphan's home
And came to rest upon a child
With her nose pressed up against the window pane
And the old man knew he'd found a friend at last
So he waved at her and smiled
And they both knew they'd spend the winter laughing at the rain

And they did spend the winter laughing at the rain
Talkin' thru the trees and exchanging little gifts 
They'd made for each other
The old man would carve toys for the little girl
And she would draw picture for him of beautiful ladies
Surrounded by green trees and sunshine
And they laughed a lot
But then on the first day of June
The little girl ran to the fence to show
The old man a picture she had drawn
But he wasn't there
And somehow the little girl knew he wasn't coming back
So she went back to her little room
Took a crayon, piece of paper and wrote:

Whoever finds this I love you
Whoever finds this I need you
I ain't even got no one to talk to
So whoever finds this I love you

Dream beside me in the midnight glow, the lamp Is low
Dream and watch the shadows came and go, the lamp Is low
While you linger in my arms, my lips will sigh ""I love you so"" 
Dream the sweetest dream will ever know
Tonight the moon is high, the lamp Is low
",The Lamp Is Low,1995
Patti Page,"I'm dreaming of a white Christmas
Just like the ones I used to know
Where the tree tops glisten
And children listen
To hear sleigh bells in the snow

I'm dreaming of a white Christmas
With every Christmas card I write
May your days be merry and bright
And may all your Christmases be white

I'm dreaming of a white Christmas
Just like the ones I used to know
Where the tree tops glisten
And children listen
To hear sleigh bells in the snow

I'm dreaming of a white Christmas
With every Christmas card I write
May your days be merry and bright
And may all your Christmases
May all your Christmases
May all your Christmases
May all your Christmases be white

I'm dreaming of a white
Christmas with you
Jingle Bells all the way, all the way",White Christmas,1995
Patti Page,"Hi-lee Hi-lo Hi-lup up - up
Hi-lee Hi-lo Hi-left!
Hi-lee Hi-lo Hi-lup up - up
Hi-lee Hi-lo Hi-left!

[Chorus]
Oh, I was left (left), right (right)
Out of your arms
Oh, I was left (left), right (right)
Out of your charms
My heart said I's right (right)
Right from the start
Now I am left, right  (right, left)
Out of your heart

Oh, you were such a cute Marine
I really was impressed
You said of all the girls you knew
That you liked me the best
I gave you all my kisses
Surrendered all my charms
But time revealed, you played the field
And I  was, left

[Chorus]

You said you'd  look me up, up, up
When you got back to town
But when you hit the city
All you did was look around
I caught you with a  red-head
And, baby, tho' you said
You're merely warmin'up for me
I figure I was, left

[Chorus]

You called me on the telephone
And said: ""Suzie dear
You're bein' mighty silly
In believin' all you hear
You know I love you only
So Suzie save your breath""
But, since my name is Cindy Lou
I know that I was, left

[Chorus]",Left Right Out of Your Heart,1995
Patti Page,"It came upon the midnight clear, that glorious song of old
From angels bending near the earth to touch their harps of gold
Peace on the earth, goodwill to men, from Heaven's all gracious King
The world in solemn stillness lay to hear the angels sing

Above its sad and lowly plains they bend on hovering wing
And ever o'er its babel sounds the blessed angels sing

And He beneath life's crushing load, whose forms are bending low
Who toil along the climbing way with painful steps and slow
Look now for glad and golden hours, come swiftly on the wing
Oh, rest beside the weary road and hear the angels sing
And hear the angels sing",It Came Upon a Midnight Clear,1996
Patti Page,"We wish you a merry Christmas
We wish you a merry Christmas
We wish you a merry Christmas
And a happy New Year
Glad tidings we bring
To you and your kin
Glad tidings for Christmas
And a happy New Year

We want some milk and cookies
We want some milk and cookies
We want some milk and cookies
Please bring it right here

Patti Page,"There's a song in the land of the lily
Each sweetheart has heard with a sigh
Over high garden walls this sweet echo falls
As a soldier boy whispers goodbye

Smile the while you kiss me sad adieu
When the clouds roll by I'll come to you
Then the skies will seem more blue
Down in Lover's Lane, my dearie

Wedding bells will ring so merrily
Ev'ry tear will be a memory
So wait and pray each night for me
Till we meet again

Though goodbye means the birth of a teardrop
Hello means the birth of a smile
And the smile will erase the tear blighting trace
When we meet in the after awhile

Smile the while you kiss me sad adieu
When the clouds roll by I'll come to you
Then the skies will seem more blue
Down in Lover's Lane, my dearie

Wedding bells will ring so merrily
Ev'ry tear will be a memory
So wait and pray each night for me
Till we meet again",Till We Meet Again,1996
Patti Page,"Your eyes don't shine like they used to shine
And the thrill is gone when your lips meet mine
I'm afraid the masquerade is over
And so is love, and so is love

Your words don't mean what they used to mean
They were once inspired, now they're just routine
I'm afraid the masquerade is over
And so is love, and so is love

I guess I'll have to play Pagliacci
And get myself a clown's disguise
And learn to laugh like Pagliacci
With tears in my eyes

You look the same, you're a lot the same
But my heart says, 'No, no, you're not, you're not the same'
I'm afraid the masquerade is over
And so is love, and so is love

I guess I'll have to play Pagliacci
And get myself a clown's disguise
And learn to laugh like Pagliacci
With tears in my eyes

You look, you look the same, you're a lot the same
But my heart says, 'No, no, you're not the same'
I'm afraid the masquerade is over
And so is love, and so is love
And so is love, and so is love",(I'm Afraid) The Masquerade Is Over,1997
Patti Page,"Well look here Jack
There's something down
The track
He's got rhythm in his feet
But nothing in the sack
The boogie woogie Santa Claus
Boogie woogie Santa Claus
Boogie woogie Santa
Comes to town
Every Christmas day

Well he lives up
In a mountain
Like a hermit in the cave
He never had a haircut
He never took a shave
The boogie woogie Santa Claus
Boogie woogie Santa Claus
Boogie woogie Santa
Comes this time
Every Christmas day

Well
It's rock rock rock Mr. Santa
Jump jump jump Mr. Santa
Well the boogie woogie Santa
Will boogie all your blues away

Got no presents for your tree
No Candy for your socks
When he starts to boogie
The whole town rocks

Mama get your hat
Put your best dress on
We're gonna jump for joy
On the Christmas morn
The boogie woogie Santa Claus
Boogie woogie Santa Claus
Boogie woogie Santa Boogie
All your blues away

Jump jump jump Mr. Santa Claus
