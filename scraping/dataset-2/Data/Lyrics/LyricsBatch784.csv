Nicolas Fromageau,"I was someone else's girl
Every time you look in my eyes
All that I felt somehow dies

No, no, no, no
Can't you see what you're doing to me?
No, no, no, no

Don't look at me with that smile
Don't act like everything's fine
Stop putting dreams in my head
When I should've thought of him instead

When you say the things you do
It makes me want to be with you
And every time that he kisses me
You are always what I see

No, no, no, no
You make me forget about him
No, no, no, no

Don't look at me with that smile
Don't act like everything's fine
Stop putting dreams in my head
When I should've thought of him instead

No, no, no, no
Can't you see what you're doing to me?
No, no, no, no

Don't look at me with that smile
Don't act like everything's fine
Stop putting dreams in my head
When I should've thought of him instead

Don't look at me with that smile
Don't act like everything's fine
Stop putting dreams in my head

Nicolas Hodges,"I was a stranger in the city
Out of town were the people I knew
I had that feeling of self-pity
What to do, what to do, what to do
The outlook was decidedly blue

But as I walked through the foggy streets alone
It turned out to be the luckiest day I've known

A foggy day, in London town
Had me low, had me down
I viewed the morning, with much alarm
British Museum, had lost its charm

How long I wondered,
Could this thing last
But the age of miracles, hadn't past
For suddenly, I saw you there
And through foggy London town,
The sun was shining everywhere

For suddenly, I saw you there

Nicolas Hodges,"As a tot, when I trotted in little velvet panties,
I was kissed by my sisters, my cousins, and my aunties.
Sad to tell, it was hell, an inferno worse than Dante's.

So my dear I swore,
""Never, never more !""
On my list, I insisted that kissing must be crossed out.
Now, I find I was blind, and oh my! 
How I lost out!

I could cry salty tears,
Where have I been all these years?
Little wow, tell me now,
How long has this been going on?

There were chills up my spine,
And some thrills I can't define.
Listen, sweet, I repeat,
How long has this been going on?

Oh, I feel that I could melt,
Into Heaven I'm hurled!
I know how Columbus felt,
Finding another world.

Kiss me once, then once more.
What a dunce I was before.
What a break! 
For Heaven's sake!
How long has this been going on?

Dear, when in your arms I creep,
That divine rendezvous,
Don't wake me, if I'm asleep,
Let me dream that it's true!

Kiss me twice, then once more.
That makes thrice, let's make it four!
What a break! 
For Heaven's sake!

How long has this, been going on?",How long has this been going on?,2004
Nicolas Hodges,"It's very clear, our love is here to stay
Not for a year but ever and a day
The radio and the telephone and the movies that we know
May just be passing fancies and in time may go

But oh, my dear, our love is here to stay
Together we're going a long, long way
In time the Rockies may crumble, Gibraltar may tumble
They're only made of clay
But our love is here to stay

In time the Rockies may crumble, Gibraltar may tumble

Nicolas King,"I have often walked
Down the street before,
But the pavement always
Stayed beneath my feet before.
All at once am i
Several stories high,
Knowing I?m on the street where you live.

Are there lilac trees
In the heart of town?
Can you hear a lark in any other part of town?
Does enchantment pour
Out of every door?
No, it?s just on the street where you live.

And oh, the towering feeling
Just to know somehow you are near
The overpowering feeling
That any second you may suddenly appear.

People stop and stare
They don?t bother me,
For there?s no where else on earth
That I would rather be.

Let the time go by,
I won?t care if i
Can be here on the street where you live.

Nicolas Margaritakis,"Oh, you can kiss me on a Monday
A Monday, a Monday is very, very good
Or you can kiss me on a Tuesday
A Tuesday, a Tuesday, in fact I wish you would
Or you can kiss me on a Wednesday
A Thursday, a Friday and Saturday is best
But never, never on a Sunday
A Sunday, a Sunday, 'cause that's my day of rest
 
Most any day you can be my guest
Any day you say, but my day of rest
Just name the day that you like the best
Only stay away on my day of rest
 
Oh, you can kiss me on a cool day, a hot day
A wet day, which everyone you choose
Or try to kiss me on a gray day, a May day
A pay day, and see if I refuse
And if you make it on a bleak day
A freak day, a week day, why you can be my guest

Nicolas Montier,"Just friends, lovers no more
Just friends, but not like before

Nicolas Montier,"Lately, I find myself out gazing at stars, 
Hearing guitars like someone in love.
Sometimes the things I do astound me, 
Mostly whenever you're around me.
Lately I seem to walk as though I had wings, 
Bump into things like someone in love.
Each time I look at you, 
I'm limp as a glove, 
And feeling like someone in love.",Like Someone in Love,2004
Nicolas Payton,"Walked with no one and talked with no one
And I had nothing but shadows
Then one morning you passed
And I brightened at last
Now I greet the day and complete the day
With the sun in my heart
All my worry blew away
When you taught me how to say

Grab your coat and get your hat
Leave your worry on the doorstep
Just direct your feet
To the sunny side of the street
Can't you hear a pitter-pat?
And that happy tune is your step
Life can be so sweet
On the sunny side of the street

I used to walk in the shade
With those blues on parade
But I'm not afraid
This Rover crossed over

If I never have a cent
I'd be rich as Rockefeller
Gold dust at my feet
On the sunny side of the street
Grab your street",On the Sunny Side of the Street,

3. Huit heures vingt ils doivent être en cours
Ils sont toujours en cours pensent jamais à rien
Qu'à leur future carrière
Pensent qu'à être fiers
Un jour seront perdus
Sans l'avoir jamais su

Suite (3) : Sébastien lui a dit ""Faut changer""
Faut tout recommencer
Surtout pas ressembler aux autres et puis
Faut pas leur en vouloir
Ils peuvent pas savoir
Qu'on était différents
Mélodie faut sortir du couloir
Les laisse pas t'avoir
T'empêcheraient de penser de t'émouvoir
Tu n'aurais qu'une vie
Fait sauter les murs gris
Qui planquent ton soleil

4. Rendez-vous devant le Luxembourg
J'aurai un sac en toile
Tu me reconnaîtras
J'aurai les yeux si grands
Tu te noieras dedans
Mélodie je t'attends

1. J'ai rê-vé de toi pen-dant vingt ans sans le sa-voir qui peut con-naî-tre sa vie
Se-rais-tu du genre gar-çon manqué ou bien se-xy ri-go-lotte, ou sans es-prit
Je n'en sa-vais rien, je m'en fou-tais je m'po-sais pas de ques-tions
ça sert à rien les ques-tions
de toute fa-çon un jour ar-rive et la ré-ponse est là

Et vous voi-là et nous voi-là toi et moi l'en-vers l'en-droit,
l'en-vers l'en-droit toi et moi
Peut-être un peu sur-pris d'ha-bi-ter ce pa-ys qui nous fai-sait de l'oeil de puis long-temps

2. Tu pren-nais l'a-vion pour quelque part la tê-te en-fouie dans le col de ton blou-son
Je t'ai po-sée deux ou trois questions au su-jet d'un bou-quin com-plet'-ment bi-don
Tu m'as ré-pon-du du tact au tact un truc qui m'a fait bi-zard
je me suis sen-ti pau-mé - toi, t'é-tais rouge comme une to-mate ou une voi-ture d'pom-pier

3. - On a fait semblant de s'ignorer pendant huit jours
Dans un paradis perdu
Où j'étais parti me reposer
Avec une seule idée farniente absolue
J'essayais de compter les nuages
Mais y'en n'avait pas beaucoup
Toi j'te voyais partout
Et j'étais rouge comme une tomate ou une voiture de pompier

4. - Tu m'as demandé si c'était moi qui lisait ""le bon jour""
J'ai répondu oui
Heureusement que t'as pas insisté
J'en avais seulement lu vingt pages à midi
Je n'arrivais pas vraiment à croire
Que t'étais là devant moi
Je m'suis senti paumé
Mais je pensais pourvu qu'elle reste
Et on n's'est plus quitté.
(au Refrain :)",Et nous voilà,2013
Nicolaus Esterházy Sinfonia,"I just came back from a lovely trip along the Milky Way
Stopped off at the North Pole to spend a holiday
I called on dear old Santa Claus
To see what I could see
He took me to his workshop 
And told his plans to me, so
 
[Chorus]
You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
He's making a list and checking it twice
Gonna find out who's naughty and nice
Santa Claus is comin' to town
He sees you when you're sleepin'
He knows when you're a wake
He knows if you've been bad or good
So be good for goodness sake
Oh! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
 
With little tin horns and little toy drums
Rooty toot toots and rummy tum tums
Santa Claus is comin' to town
And curly head dolls that toddle and coo
Elephants, boats, and kiddie cars too
Santa Claus is comin' to town
Then kids in Girl and Boy land will have a jubilee
They're gonna build a Toyland all around the Christmas tree
So! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
 
Now Santa is a busy man, He has no time to play
He's got millions of stockings to fill on Christmas day
You'd better write your letter now
And mail it right away
Because he's getting ready
His reindeer's and his sleigh. So
 
[Chorus]

Sing with me, how great is our God
All will see how great is our God

The first, is that God is better than the world's best thing
God is better than the best thing that the world has to offer

Magnify, magnify, lift it on high
Spit it Spotify to qualify a spot on His side
I cannot modify or ratify, my momma made me apple pies
Lullabies and alibis
The book don't end with Malachi
Devil will win employee of the month by the dozen
'Til one score and three years from the third when he doesn't
My village raised 'em a child, come through the crib and it's bustin'
You meet anyone from my city, they gon' say that we cousins
Shabach Barak, edify
Electrify the enemy like Hedwig 'til he petrefied
Any petty Peter Petigrew could get the pesticide
79th, 79th, I don't believe in science
I believe in signs
Don't believe in signing, I see dollar signs
Color white collar crime
Good God, the gift of freedom
Hosena Santa invoked and woke up slaves from south Hampton to Chatham Manor
My dream girl's behind me, feel like I'm James Early
The type of worship make Jesus come back a day early
With the faith of a pumpkin-seed-sized mustard seed
Here, for I will speak noble things as they trusted me
Only righteous, I might just shrug at the skullduggery
I couldn't stand to see another rapper lose custody
Exalt, Exalt, glorify
Descend upon the earth with swords and fortify the borders where your shoulders lies
I used to hide from God
Ducked down in the slums like ""shhh""

I was lost in the jungle like Simba after the death of Mufasa
No hog, no meerkat, hakuna matata by day
But I spent my night time fighting tears back
I prayed and prayed and left messages but never got no hear back
Or so it seemed
A mustard seed was all I needed to sow a dream
I build the ark, gently, gently, rowed my boat down Noah's stream
Sometimes the path I took to reach my petty goals was so extreme
I was so far down in the mud couldn't even let my light shine
But she was always there when I needed to phone a friend or use a life line
From a lofty height to wage war
On the poltergeist with the exalt of Christ
Spark the dark with the pulse of light
Strike a corpse with a pulse of life
I spit on the Tidal of tidal waves
I spit on the Apple and kill a worm
A fire in Cali will swallow a valley for every African village burned
Jay Elect would've never made it
O' son of man, O' son of man
Who was the angel in Revelations with the foot on water and the foot on land
Who was the angel that rode a Harley from the project to the house of Parliament
And opened the book in the Devil's chamber and put the true name of the Lord in it
Old Jerusalem, New Jerusalem
Cuff lights these beats with a ball of fire
They poisoned the scripture and gave us the pictures of false messiahs
It was all a lie
Mystery babylon, tumbling down
Satan's establishment crumbling down
This is the year that I come for the crown
Bury my enemies under the ground",How Great,2016

Als wär's das letzte Mal
Denn sonst ist mir alles egal.

Laß mich nie allein!

Hast nie deine Zärtlichkeit verlor'n.

Now I'm taking that game up and the ace of hearts is high.

When you wish upon a star
As dreamers do
Fate is kind

She brings to those who love
The sweet fulfillment of their secret longing

Like a bolt out of the blue
Fate steps in and sees you through
When you wish upon a star
Your dreams come true

When you wish upon a star
Makes no difference who you are
Anything your heart desires will come to you

If your heart is in your dream
No request is too extreme
When you wish upon a star
As dreamers do
Fate is kind

She brings to those who love
The sweet fulfillment of their secret longing
Like a bolt out of the blue
Fate steps in and sees you through
When you wish upon a star

Nicole,"Not yet a woman and certainly not a child
But I was caught somewhere in the middle
On that one Friday afternoon and I
I remember Mama sayin', ""It's time for you to go
Go on out and change the world and become
All that you have dreamed of""

And as the tears that she was cryin'
Fell from her face and shoulders, she said
""Don't forget who you are, child
Where you come from, where you're goin'
Cause I'm always gonna be here for you
Fightin' in your corner, so with every bow you take
Take one for those that came before you""

Go on now, fly, fly, butterfly
Stand upon these two shoulders of mine
Spread those wings of yours and fly

Now I'm a woman and I've got a child
And I just can't believe the day's gonna come
When she tells me that it's time to soar
And I don't know what I'm will do
Not sure what I'm gonna tell her

Maybe, don't forget who you are, child
Where you come from, where you're going
Cause I'm always gonna be here for you
Fightin' in your corner, so with every bow you take
Take one for those that came before ya

Go on now, fly, fly, butterfly
Stand upon these two shoulders of mine
Spread those wings of yours and fly

There is something sacred
About the letting go of those we wanna hold
So tightly to, but somehow we know they must move on
On for those who have a dream to make our future better and

On for those who will earn their wings
In spite of wind and weather you tell 'em love is waiting there
Forever in their corner, so with every bow they take
They'll take one for those that came before them

Go on now, fly, fly, butterfly
Stand upon these two shoulders of mine
Spread those wings of yours and fly

Fly high, butterfly, but you'll never never know
If you don't try
Fly high, butterfly",Butterfly,1982

You make me hot
You make my body feel delirious.
Please
Don't ever stop
Listen when I'm being serious.
'Cause you and I were made for each other

Don't you want my love
Don't you need my body?
Don't you want my love?
Won't you take my heart until we get started?
Then you'll want my love!

Hot is how I feel when you bring your body next to mine.
Heat
It feels so real

'Cause sweat runs down my body everytime.
'Cause you and I just one night together

Dass ich die Hoffnung nie mehr verlier .

Die Sonne brennt dort oben heiß 
Wer so hoch hinaus will der ist in Gefahr 
Flieg' nicht so hoch mein kleiner Freund 
Glaub' mir ich mein' es gut mit dir 
Keiner hilft dir dann ich weiß es ja

Und er sang vom roten Sand in dem großen fernen Land

Shitty bees up in da place
Wanna be down with whoever
Be all up in his face but aint even on the level
I pull your wig back

That heat be to hot
Melt down, now up in pot
Count down, 3-2-1, lift off
Now over tize, Venus we circlize
And mars we tantalize
Comatize like Hale-Bopp

All I do is just sit at home, and 

Wait until he return my call, and 

Why is it that he don't trust me 

Is it that he's the one messing up, see 

I should be the one who's questioning 

Why my man is always asking 

[Chorus (sung by Missy and Nicole)] 

Where I been 

Where I go 

Who I'm with 

Am I out , messing up 

When will I, be back 

Am I out, in the streets, doing stuff

"Nicole ""Faithful"" Franklin","Not yet a woman and certainly not a child
But I was caught somewhere in the middle
On that one Friday afternoon and I
I remember Mama sayin', ""It's time for you to go
Go on out and change the world and become
All that you have dreamed of""

And as the tears that she was cryin'
Fell from her face and shoulders, she said
""Don't forget who you are, child
Where you come from, where you're goin'
Cause I'm always gonna be here for you
Fightin' in your corner, so with every bow you take
Take one for those that came before you""

Stand upon these two shoulders of mine
Spread those wings of yours and fly

Now I'm a woman and I've got a child
And I just can't believe the day's gonna come
When she tells me that it's time to soar
And I don't know what I'm will do
Not sure what I'm gonna tell her

Maybe, don't forget who you are, child
Where you come from, where you're going
Cause I'm always gonna be here for you
Fightin' in your corner, so with every bow you take
Take one for those that came before ya

Go on now, fly, fly, butterfly
Stand upon these two shoulders of mine
Spread those wings of yours and fly

There is something sacred
About the letting go of those we wanna hold
So tightly to, but somehow we know they must move on
On for those who have a dream to make our future better and

On for those who will earn their wings
In spite of wind and weather you tell 'em love is waiting there
Forever in their corner, so with every bow they take
They'll take one for those that came before them

Go on now, fly, fly, butterfly

Can you hold to what you have?
Can you make the moment last?

Tell me if you give away your heart
And the life tears you apart

I will always love you
Like a thousand rivers from my soul
I will always love you

I miss you and the funny things you say
I remember every day
In a hundred different ways

I miss you being here with me
Thought you've been set free
I hold you in my memory

'cause no matter how far you go
I will always love you
Like a thousand rivers from my soul
I will always love you

Across the great divide
And if soul to the skies above
Can conquer the earth below

So that I will know the beauty that they bring, that they bring

Of my grandpa and them back when

Were sown in love by them

I dream of being a soccer player.
I dream of being a basketball player.
I dream of being a pastor.
I dream of being a race car driver.
I dream of becoming a teacher.


His momma said here's
Some fish and bread. There's
Just enough to get you by.
It's not a lot, but
It's all that we've got.
Then a tear came to her eye.

And she took it, blessed it,
As she looked up to the sky.
She said, ""Take it and share it.
I pray it will be multiplied""

It was so little. There were so many
To feed them all would take so much.
But He didn't laugh when the boy gave Him
What He knew was not enough

So Jesus took it and blessed it
And all the love that filled His eyes
When He held it and broke it
'Cause only then it multiplied

So I said ""Take it, bless it, hold it,
Break it, Break it, Break it""

Messed up and wounded
Undone and yielded
I offer up this sacrifice
It's not a lot but
It's all I've got
What can You do with such a life?

Then Jesus took it and blessed it
And all the love that filled His eyes
When He held it and broke it
'Cause only then I multiplied

See Jesus took me and blessed me
And all the love that filled His eyes
When He held me and broke me
'Cause only then I multiplied

So I say change me and please bless me
Lord please hold me and please break me
I know You'll take me and I'm asking You to bless me
And Lord please hold me and I know You're gonna,
You're gonna break me

Soon all Earth will do the same.

Where every tear that we have cried,
Will be comforted and dried.
We'll eat from the Tree of Life,
And life will never end.

And we'll worship at your throne,
Where you'll make your Glory known.
That you are God and God alone,
And we pray.

Thy kingdom come,
Thy will be done,
Right here on Earth, as it is in heaven.
Come,
Make us your home,
And let thy kingdom,
Let thy kingdom
Let it come!
Thy will be done,
Right here on earth, as it is in heaven.
Come.

On our jobs,
In our churches,

In our government,
In our relationships,
In our schools,
In our marriages.

Et que nos mains auront appris plus que l'on ne peut dire
Mieux que de l'or saurons nous tenir comme alors

Aura laissé notre maison pour celle d'un amour

Mein altes Leben, schmeckt wie 'n labbriger Toast
Brat mir ein Prachtsteak, Peter kocht jetzt feinstes Fleisch
Ich bin das Update, Peter Fox 1.1
Ich will abshaken, feiern, doch mein Teich ist zu klein
Mir wächst neue Reihe Beißer wie bei'm weißen Hai

Bereit die Welt zu retten, auch wenn das vielleicht zu viel gewollt ist

There's a light we can love on the way.
There is a wonder and wildness to life,
And freedom for those who obey.
All those who seek it shall find it,
A pardon for all who believe.

To all who've been born of the Spirit

Who belong to eternity, stranded in time,
And weary of struggling with sin.

And there in the same country, shepherds abiding in the field
Keeping watch over their flock by night
And lo, the Angel of the Lord came upon them
And the glory of the Lord shone round about there
And they were so afraid

And the Angel said unto them, ""Fear not, but behold
I bring you good tiding of great joy which will be to all people

'Cause I'm all confused and hurt inside
And I feel so bad I wanna to cry
Tried everything just to please my love

Said, I'll get on my knees each and every night
And I'll pray He'll bring us back to life

And if you take away my rainbow I will cry(cry)

Listen to my tears I'm waking up to skies so gray
Needing you to brighten up my day

Okay listen catch your breath cool out 
You need to calm down (that's right)
Concentrate don't go making all your time run out
See your okay it looks much worse than it really is,
And you'll pull through come on you know how we be doing this
It's me and you yo, you promised you can't pull out now,
We're friends for life so you can't just sell me out 
We shared a lot but you know we'll see just so much more
Our wedding day and the children that we prayed for

My reality is blurry I'm afraid of being all alone
Your light has been my guide throughout the good and bad 
I wish that I had spent a little more attention to my one and only sunshine

Listen, I'd never leave you yo, 
I swore on my grave
Damn what's that I'm feeling dizzy 
Kinda getting faint
But it ain't nothing 
Didn't sleep that much last night
From watching over you but none less I'm cool I'm fine
I said I'm feeling fine 
So back up off me I'm alright
I'm here to see my friends 
And what's up with that blinding light
Said I don't need to lie down 
I don't need your help right now 
What's up with all the noises all the running round
You've got it wrong I'm not the one 
Who needs the help in here
Yo, what's up with you, 
You're crying I see tears
Yo, what's going on don't leave 
Please don't take her out
Said I don't understand 
I'm kinda feeling scared now
I said it's getting hard to breathe 
Getting hard to see
I'm not too sure anymore what's going on with me

Would you wanna know when the things you had done
She might lose her cool and be tempted to run

You want the truth, you can't handle the truth

Go 'head do what you came to do
You want to follow my past well it's up to you
When I keep it on the real don't get an attitude
You want the truth, you can't handle the truth

How many men did you have? Don't ask her that
Can you count on one hand? Don't ask her that
Am I like your last man? Don't ask her that
We on a need to know basis and you don't need to know

Back in the day were you a freak, don't ask her that
In the past hey did you creep? Don't ask her that
How you so good between the sheets? Don't ask her that
We on a need to know basis and you don't need to know

Nicole Scherzinger,"Yo yo, this Mase, youknowhatI'msayin?
You got niggas that don't like me for whatever reason
You got niggas that don't want to see me rich
You got niggas that's mad, cause I'm always with they bitch
Then you got niggas that just don't like me
You know, the, those P.H.D. niggas
But you know I pop a lot of shit but I back it up though
See it's a difference, a lot of niggas pop shit
But a lot of niggas don't make hits
But it's like this whole Bad Boy shit
We come to bring it to y'all niggas, me, B.I., Puff, Lox, whoever
Black Rob
If you want to dance, we dance

Now trick what? Lace who? That ain't what Mase do
Got a lot of girls that'd love to replace you
Tell you to your face Boo, not behind your back
Niggas talk shit, we never mind that
Funny, never find that, Puff a dime stack
Write hot shit, and make a nigga say, 'Rewind that'
Niggas know, we go against the Harlem Jigalo
Getcha hoe, lick her low, make the bitch, hit the do'
I represent honies with money fly guys with gems
Drive with the tints that be thirty-five percent
Hoes hope I lay so I look both ways
Cop says, 'OK, my tint smoke gray'
No way, nigga leave without handin me my shit
Got plans to get my Land and my 6
Niggas outta pen'll understand this shit
Pop champagne like I won a championship (uh, uh)

[Chorus]
Been around the world and I I I
And we been playa hated (say what?)
I don't know and I don't know why
Why they want us faded (hehe)
I don't know why they hate us (yeah)
Is it our ladies? (uh-huh)
Or our drop Mercedes (uh, uh)
Bay-bee bay-BEE!

I was in one bedroom, dreamin' of a million (yeah)
Now I'm in beach houses, cream to the ceiling (that's right)
I was a gentleman, livin in tenements
Now I'm swimmin in, all the women that be tens (ho)
Went from Bad Boys to the Crushed Linen Men
Now my divi-dends be the new Benjamins (uh-huh)
Hoes of all complexions, I like cinnamon
Mase you got some hoes well nigga, send em in (c'mon)
What you waitin' for, let the freak show begin
How they came in a truck? (Nah Puff, that's a Benz)
Mercedes, c'mere baby, you don't like the way
It's hot and hazy, never shady, you must be crazy
It's ridiculous, how you put your lips on this
Don't kiss right there girlfriend I'm ticklish (heheh)
And I be switchin' fees with a wrist full of G's
Nigga please, I'm the macaroni with the cheese

[Chorus]

Now Puff rule the world, even though I'm young
I make it my biz to see that all ladies come (yeah)
Get em all strung from the tip of my tongue
Lick em places niggas wouldn't dare put they faces (c'mon)
Before I die, hope I, remake a flow by
In the brand new treasure on a old try
Now when my third dry, even when the smoke lie
Eat the mami's chocha and drive her loca
We never ride far, packed five in a car
Save money for the drinks, I'm about to buy the bar (yeah)
And everywhere I drive I'm a star, little kids
All on the corner scream, ""That's my car!""
It was days couldn't be fly, now I'm in a T.I.
Come in clubs with B.I., now a nigga V.I. (uh-huh)
Rock tons of gold, 'nough money I fold
Roll the way you want to roll, break a hundred out the toe

[Chorus]

See'mon, yeah yeah, uh-huh
We been playa hated!
Why?
Why they want us hated!
Why they hate us?
Is it our ladies?
Say what?
Yeah, bay-bee bay-BEE!

[Chorus]

You know, sometimes I gotta ask myself
Why's there so much jealousy in the world?
Don't look at mine, get yours

Baby I know
When we started out there were things you didn't know

I know I'm asking for a lot but just trust
You say that things getting old
Sneakin', round creepin' and love on the low
Now babygirl
I can't wait till' it's officially us
I can't wait let them know about us

First I thought that I could take you boy but I don't know (I don't know)
You told me you were gonna leave her for me long ago (long ago)

Eventually I will but I just gotta take it slow
Don't wanna break her heart, although I gotta let her go so baby

So please don't say you wanna give up.
How do I tell her that I'm fallen in love,
And I know your waiting patiently for that day,
When we no longer have to lie about us.
When I'm with her all I want is your touch,
And when you call me I don't wanna hang up,
And I know I say it often but I can't wait
Till' we no longer have to lie about us.

Baby I know the situation don't seem fair to us both
But babygirl, she's an issue that I'm bout to adjust
Don't mistake the love we make for just lust,
You are my soul, mind, body, spirit all that I know.
But babygirl I can't wait till' it's officially us
I can't wait to tell the world about us.

Music bumping, sweat dripping on the danceflo'
I like it when shorty get to backing it back
When she do it like that, I don't know how to act

Now work it, go ahead grind it on me, that's perfect
I'll pay to play if it's worth it
My phone when you want me you can chirp it
Now get to work it

Let me take these bricks and break 'em down
If you want I can serve 'em by the pound
Shorty know she's got what I wanna flip
Baby girl tell me you can handle it

Well, if you want it let's go
I got that fire (So hot I burn it down)
Act like you already know
I got that fire ('Cause I'm the flyest chick around)
You want it, it's fire, I got it, that fire
So I might ignite ya, it's fire, it's fire

I burn it down on stage, I make it hot
'Til the Fire Marshalls come shut down the spot
I have the club jam packed every time I rock
These other niggas ain't got the style I got
I go back to the basics and break it all the way all the way down
You can hate it but face it B.I.G. and 2Pac just ain't around
Everywhere you go, there I go, I'm 50 Cent
Ghetto star by the bar I get you bent
You wanna party, let's party, you wanna freak be a freak
You wanna creep, we can creep tell me where should we meet so you can

Memory, all alone in the moonlight

I was beautiful then
I remember
The time I knew what happiness was

Nicole Scherzinger,"The world spit me out and I was spinning around
Lost in a free fall
Forever going down, and breakin' through the ground
When I thought I reached the end, I start to fall again

But I was taught
To never surrender
When it's hard to get up
Gonna fight till I can stand and say

Oh, you can turn me down, you can throw me now
The harder out, the harder I come back around
You can break my heart but you can't scratch my name
I can take the hit 'cause I'm a boomerang
Oh, whoa, oh whoa, oh whoa I'm a boomerang
Oh, whoa, oh whoa, oh whoa I'm a boomerang

Now I'm 10 feet tall, all my problems feel so small
Nothing in my way to make me change
No ceiling to my sky, just open space to fly
Every time I'm feeling down, I turn it back around

But I was taught
To never surrender
When it's hard to get up
Gonna fight till I can stand and say

Oh, you can turn me down, you can throw me now
The harder out, the harder I come back around
You can break my heart but you can't scratch my name
I can take the hit 'cause I'm a boomerang
Oh, whoa, oh whoa, oh whoa I'm a boomerang
Oh, whoa, oh whoa, oh whoa I'm a boomerang

Even though I'm flying high
The sky can change one day
I can hit some turbulence, but who I am is never gonna change
'Cause I'm a boomerang
'Cause I'm a boomerang
'Cause I'm a boomerang

Oh, you can turn me down, you can throw me now
The harder out, the harder I come back around
You can break my heart but you can't scratch my name

Nicole Scherzinger,"Será difícil de comprender 
Que a pesar de estar hoy aquí
Soy del pueblo, jamás lo podré olvidar

Son solamente un disfraz
Un juego burgués nada más
Las reglas del ceremonial

Tenía que aceptar, debí cambiar 
Y dejar de vivir en lo gris

Sin lugar bajo el sol busqué ser libre
Pero jamás dejaré de soñar y solo podré

Nicole Scherzinger,"Moana, make way, make way!
Moana, it's time you knew
The village of Motunui is
All you need

The dancers are practising
They dance to an ancient song
(Who needs a new song? This old one's all we need)

This tradition is our mission
And Moana, there's so much to do (make way!)
Don't trip on the taro root
That's all you need

We share everything we make (we make)
We joke and we weave our baskets (aha!)
The fishermen come back from the sea

I wanna see

Don't walk away
Moana, stay on the ground now
Our people will need a chief
And there you are

There comes a day
When you're gonna look around
And realize happiness is
Where you are

Consider the coconut (the what?)
Consider its tree
We use each part of the coconut
That's all we need

We make our nets from the fibers (we make our nets from the fibers)
The water is sweet inside (the water is sweet inside)
We use the leaves to build fires (we use the leaves to build fires)
We cook up the meat inside (we cook up the meat inside)

Consider the coconuts (consider the coconuts)
The trunks and the leaves (ha!)
The island gives us what we need

And no one leaves

That's right, we stay
We're safe and we're well provided
And when we look to the future
There you are

You'll be okay
In time you'll learn just as I did
You must find happiness right
Where you are

I like to dance with the water
The undertow and the waves
The water is mischievous (ha!)
I like how it misbehaves

The village may think I'm crazy
Or say that I drift too far
But once you know what you like, well
There you are

You are your father's daughter
Stubbornness and pride
Mind what he says but remember
You may hear a voice inside
And if the voice starts to whisper
To follow the farthest star
Moana, that voice inside is
Who you are

We make our nets from the fibers (we weave our nets from the fibers)
The water is sweet inside (and we taste the sweet inside)
We use the leaves to build fires (we sing these songs in our choir)
We cook up the meat inside (we have mouths to feed inside)

The village believes in us (that's right!)
The village believes (ha!)
The island gives us what we need
And no one leaves

So here I'll stay
My home, my people beside me
And when I think of tomorrow
There we are

I'll lead the way
I'll have my people to guide me
We'll build our future together
Where we are

Where you are
You can find happiness right -

Sanai Lathan knows, I'm rakin' but makin' dough
Eighty holes in ya shirt, they're your own Jamaican clothes

I'm talkin' to Aspen's the slopes we go
You get the okie doke, play me baby I hope he know

Two pigeons, what the fuck are you pitchin'
One house, two kitchens, who's bitchin'
I'll bring the diesel, won't see the Fuschnickens
And I don't trust a ho, that's mother to baby mother

They mothers a lawyer, they fathers a doctor

And who you sposed to be, get hung from the rosaries
Call me C.O.D. that's Coke and them Oser D
Some O.D.B. off them Oser D

Boss man came through, told her come inside 
Said he didn't need her service no more 
And everything she worked hard for out the door 
First thing she did is thought about the kids 
And how to pay the bills and keep food in the fridge 
She said, ""No! This ain't right!"" Looked at him and said 
""It's a cool world, and I'm destined for greatness""

Drove by the old job, seen the old boss 
Splashed water in his face, music loud and drove off

Tried to hold her down, hold her back but he missed it

Ayo, I never claimed to be hard, tough, no homo, gangsta none of the above
Just a kid from 145th and Lennox Ave
Harlem, USA trying to make his way in the world ya heard?
Ya know through the trial of tribulations that life brings
I lost some friends, incarcerated, some are gone forever
Ya know you can't expect everything from everybody
So get up get out and get somethin, that's what I did

[Verse 1 - Cam'Ron]

Before I had the hammer cocked
A Santana rock
Little Gerv, Grandpa Jerry, Grandma Doc (thats my fam)
Uncle Carl, Uncle Ted, Uncle Steve, Uncle Bill,
Cousin Steve, Cousin Bill up on the hill now
My Aunt Normy, I don't speak to my Aunt Deita
Or my Cousin Bashiba, love my Mother Fredricka
Neighbour Freida, daughter Raven and Nika
Down another doorbell was that nigga Warden Nell
He gave birth to the best emcee you never heard
Lever after lever and was clever with whatever word
Derek Armstead, Bloodshed from C.O.C
He did damage, road managed my G.O.D
Aka Duke Da God, he was stupid hard
16, the bitch dream had stupid cars
Cut the ' 68, hooptie ' 75
Still drives some bullshit, I don't know why
I loved the nigga though, for him put cris in the air
First one that diss him in here, I swear I'll risk my career
That's a fact they ain't talking no rap shit
I'm talking that mack clip, niggas will backflip, act sick
My dude study the sabbath
No beef, veggie nigga, maybe some catfish
He could have my house, he could keep my mauries
He could drive my cars, this a eastside story

(Thats why my dudes love me I let them do them.
You either gonna be rich or famous fuckin wit me, probably both.
If you happen to brush shoulders wit me by accident,
Play lotto, nine out of ten times you gonna win nigga.)

[Chorus - Nicole Wray (x2)]

To play the game, sure to win
??
I sacrificed, I rolled the dice
I love the hood, I love my life

[Verse 2 - Cam'Ron]

See a boss I prepared to be
When I walk away from a confrontation I ain't scared of you I'm scared of me
I got a gun, you don't so it flares you'll see
After that a 5,000 volt chair for me
So I move carefully, niggas don't care for me
Who care I don't, you share I won't
Calm down (uhuh) breathe again
I don't do extortion unless I wanna receive an end
Talk to my money, first time I heard her speak (what she say)
That's word to me, told me I deserve to eat (what happened)
Moved to a killa ave, right from a murder street (what you did)
Rocked adida forms even though they hurt my feet (thats fucked up)
I don't look in the sky, never mind stars
You also find stars, right behind bars
Snazz, Black, Do' on house arrest
Zeke, shiek, won't even throw out the rest
They wanted my ass right alongside zeke
Turn myself in, nope play hide and go seek
I'm gone, put the clip in the chrome
Yeah I'm just like a fly, see the shit that I'm on
And, hour after hour I would chill at the afterhours
Where they flash the power, no bath or shower
In that same spot, realize math is power
So I pointed the mansion, that is ours

My momma hustled hard and then had to get the bills paid
While you probably ridin' round the in yo Escalade
But now that I got money I went and bought me 2 mansions
Just to stunt on them niggas who told me I never had it
I walk out the door the other day and my momma told me you got a lot to learn
She told me just because we got all these money to burn don't think I can't be a turned

Snow man old man when you trying to shine like gold
When its my time to blow partner I'mma know
In the mist getting dough I was here with highs and lows
My Melo tried to play me like my fucking eyes was closed
Now I'm sittin here wishing that my guys didn't know
They love a G, so they despise a soul
What they gon' do to him, beyond my control
When the reaper calls, it's your time to go
Never play a nigga when you see that he is tying to grow
Candy blocker when he knocked out ?
Empty chamber so I'm watching every angle

I say slow down, slow down
What the fuck you mean nigga
Just ran to your crib and popped your daughter in the spleen
I'll be there in 20 minutes but it only took fifteen
We wasn't that tight but cool enough for me to hit the scene
No knowing that this was all a set up
Secretly they want me wet up
Jealous of my future cheddar, however
They passes move was to slow for me
I pulled up, wasn't no ambulance, there wasn't no police
Something fishy going on, not even kept pressing on
Nine gripped thinking the killer could still be on the lawn
Opened the front door they shot, I shot, some abrupt shit
The nigga with something to lose almost lost it, won't trust him again

Will rock tee's, 300 a pop for these
Please bum me, you don't owe you money
They ignite got flipped and I got blow for a grip
Sipping on a Heinie with my Jamie boo besides me
That's my fucking best friend
When I be tweaking she be calming a brother
Like the touch from a mother
I am so damn comfortable I never want to leave it
The feeling is something like a spiritual healer
That could end me, I think that's the part I find intriguing

On the wayward ways of this wayward town
That her smile becomes a smirk

Nicole Yarling,"The very thought of you makes my heart sing
Like an April breeze on the wings of spring,
And you appear in all your splendor,
My one and only love.

The shadows fall and spread their mystic charms
In the hush of night while you're in my arms.
I feel your lips, so warm and tender,
My one and only love.

The touch of your hand is like heaven,
A heaven that I've never known.
The blush on your cheek whenever I speak
Tells me that you are my own.

You fill my eager heart with such desire.
Ev'ry kiss you give sets my soul on fire.
I give myself in sweet surrender,
My one and only love.",My One and Only Love,1999

Old black magic that you weave so well

Down and down I go
Round and round I go
Like a leaf caught in a tide
I should stay away but what can I do 
I hear your name and I'm a flame

Flame, flame of desire 
Only your kiss can put out the fire 
Oh you're the lover I have waiting for 
Your the mate that fate had me created for 
And every time your lips meet mine

Down and down I go 
Round and round I go 
In a spin, lovin' the spin I'm in

All I can say is ""I'm sorry""

Please don't be sad. If it was a straight life you had,
None of us would've known you all the years.

You take everybody's loneliness with you.
What do you lose each time you face down a room?

Of strangers and lovers that took you.
All of us sang, and all of us failed.
In one way we don't ever hear you.

Nicolle Galyon,"Before I even learned to play a note, I was on stage
Mastering the art of selling myself at a young age
Fear and insecurity drove me like a Maserati
High school was like showing up at a costume party
I was a comedian, an athlete
A golden boy, a black sheep
Whatever I had to be to make the world throw candy at me
And college was the same act, different play
It was October 31st every day
And the real world was an all too familiar street
Another trick, another treat

Then I knock-knock-knocked on your door
Every mask I ever wore
Shattered like glass on the floor

Rest in peace, rest in peace, rest in peace

But what would it change if I knew
Maybe my parents messed up
But, hey, they’re just dressed up kids too
Maybe I guess what I’m trying to say is I love you
For being somebody I’m not ashamed to introduce my skeletons to
I still put on my Superman cape and hide in it
But when I’m with you it comes untied for a minute
Hits the ground in the shadow of your skin

Wärd drinn' nicht draußen,
Dazwischen ein Fahrrad,
Wärd innen nicht außen.
So fahr ich durch die Stadt
Wünsch ich könnt fliegen
In Windgeschwindigkeit.
Ich könnte mich beamen
Dann wär der Weg zu dir nicht weit.

Autos rauschen,
Blätter wehen,
Man weiß nicht von woher.
Tage vergehen
Irgendwo hin.
In der Waschmaschine wär noch Platz gewesen.

Wärd drinn' nicht draußen,
Unter mir Rasen
Wenn der Himmel jemals endet
Dann als Doppelverglasung.
Ein Sprung in der Scheibe
Und dann von Ast zu Ast.
I'm Zweifel sich entzweit
Bis dazwischen ein Blatt passt.

Autos rauschen,
Blätter wehen,
Man weiß nicht von woher.
Stunden verrinnen
Irgendwo hin.
In der Waschmaschine wär noch Platz gewesen.

Die Gedanken sprigen herum,
In der Dämmerung übern Freibadzaun.
Kommen geflogen klopfen an
Die Decke vom 5-Meter-Turm.
Wie heißes Popcorn.

Autos rauschen,
Blätter wehen,
Von man weiß nicht von woher.
Wolken entschwinden.
Irgendwo hin.

And curly head dolls that toddle and coo
Elephants, boats, and kiddie cars too

Then kids in Girl and Boy land will have a jubilee
They're gonna build a Toyland all around the Christmas tree
So! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why

Now Santa is a busy man, He has no time to play
He's got millions of stockings to fill on Christmas day

And mail it right away

His reindeer's and his sleigh. So

Over land and sea
Yet a moonbeam on the water

And it seems that I can see
The gleaming candlelight
Still burning bright
Through the sycamores for me
The new-mown hay sends all its fragrance
Through the fields I used to roam
When I dream about the moonlight on the Wabash
How I long for my Indiana home

Fancy paints on memory's canvas
Scenes that we hold dear
We recall them in days after
Clearly they appear
And often times I see
A scene that's dear to me

Who was generous, gracious and good
That was my dad

To be devoted to
