Merle Haggard & the Strangers,"Deep inside this lonely prison where the pleasures are so few;
Where the walls are strong and the days are long and there's nothin' new.
I learned to play the guitar. 
I'm doin' the best I can.
I guess things could be worse 'cause I made the prison band.
I made the prison band.

Well there's ol' bashful Bill on the doghouse bass, 
Willie on the steel guitar. 
He hails from Pocatello and He drags a pretty mean bar.
Back on the drums is two-time Tom, a rimshot tempo man.
They call me their singin' Emcee 'cause I made the prison band.
Yes I made the prison band.

I'd been plannin' a break since Christmas. 
I had the details all worked out.
But now I know that I ain't gonna go and there ain't no doubt.
I had my try-out Sunday and the outcome changed my plans.
I gotta rehearse for the Friday night show 'cause I made the prison band.
I made the prison band.

Well there's Ol' bashful Bill on the doghouse bass, 
Willie on the steel guitar. 
He hails from Pocatello and He drags a pretty mean bar.
Back on the drums is two-time Tom, a rim shot tempo man.

Yes I made the prison band.",I Made the Prison Band,2013
Merle Haggard & the Strangers,"There's a long line of mourners coming down our street
Their fancy cars are such a sight to see
They're all of your rich friends that knew you in the city
And now they finally brought you back to me

The papers told of how you lost your life
Of the party and the fatal crash that night
The race on the highway the curve nobody seen
Now you're riding in that long black limousine

When you left home you told me that, that someday you'd be returning
With a fancy car for the whole town to see
Well now everybody's watching now and I guess you finally got your dream
You're riding in one of them long black limousines

Through tears I watch as you ride by
With a chauffeur at the wheel dressed up so fine
I'll never love another my heart and all my dreams
Ride with you in that long black limousine",Long Black Limousine,2013
Merle Haggard & the Strangers,"She came her to see me today
In prison where I have to stay
But this time she came here
To tell me goodbye

Pretending that I understood
I held back the tears best I could
But I know that she knew
I wanted to cry

'Cause my hands are tied
I'm locked here inside
I want her, I need her, I love her
But my hands are tied

Her visits kept my world alive
Our love found the way to survive
But now it's all over
I've lost her for good

She waited with arms open wide
Till somebody else stepped inside
But I know she waited
As long as she could

'Cause my hands are tied
I'm locked here inside
I want her, I need her, I love her
But my hands are tied",My Hands Are Tied,2013
Merle Haggard & the Strangers,"There'll always be a few of us
To keep the barrooms busy
And there'll always be fools like me
With no place else to turn

'Cause liquor has the charmin' taste
To keep you coming back
For it's true I guess
That some of us never learn

A crowded bar
Can't ever change the past
But from time to time
We drown it in a glass

'Cause liquor has the charmin' taste
To keep you coming back
Well, it's true I guess
That some of us never learn

A crowded bar
Can't ever change the past
Oh but from time to time
We drown it in a glass

'Cause liquor has the charmin' taste
To keep you coming back
Oh, it's true I guess
That some of us never learn, never learn",Some Of Us Never Learn,2013
Merle Haggard & the Strangers,"Precious mem'ries unseen angel sent from somewhere to my soul 
How they linger ever near me and the sacred past unfolds 
Precious mem'ries how they linger how they ever flood my soul 
In the stillness of the midnight precious sacred seems unfold 

Precious father loving mother fly across the lonely years 
And the old home scenes from my childhood in fond memory appear 
Precious mem'ries how they linger
Precious mem'ries flood my soul",Precious Memories,
Merle Johnston,"I used to have a perfect sweetheart
Not a real one, just a dream
A wonderful vision of us as a team
Can you imagine how I feel now
Love is real now, it's ideal
You're just what I wanted
And now it's nice to live
Paradise to live

I know why I've waited
Know why I've been blue
Prayed each night for someone
Exactly like you

Why should we spend money
On a show or two
No one does those love scenes
Exactly like you

You make me feel so grand
I want to hand the world to you
I hope you'll understand
Each foolish little scheme I'm schemin'
And dream I'm dreamin'

Now I know why mother
Taught me to be true
She meant me for someone
Exactly like you",Exactly Like You,2004

Merle Travis,"In scarlet Town where I was born 
There was a fair maid dwelling 
Made many a youth cry well a day 
Her name was Barbara Allen 

It was in the merry month of May 
When green buds they were swelling 
Sweet William came from the west country 
And he courted Barbara Allen 

He sent his servant unto her 
To the place where she was dwelling 
Said my master's sick, bids me call for you 
If your name be Barbara Allen 

Well, slowly, slowly got she up 
And slowly went she nigh him 
But all she said as she passed his bed 
Young man I think you're dying 

Then lightly tripped she down the stairs 
She heard those church bells tolling 
And each bell seemed to say as it tolled 
Hard hearted Barbara Allen 

O, mother, mother go make my bed 
And make it long and narrow 
Sweet William died for me today 
I'll die for him tomorrow 

They buried Barbara in the old church yard 
They buried Sweet William beside her 
Out of his grave grew a red, red rose 
And out of hers a briar 

They grew and grew up the old church wall 
Till they could grow no higher 
And at the top twined a lover's knot 
The red rose and the briar",Barbara Allen,1947
Merle Travis,"I am a pilgrim and a stranger
Traveling through this wearisome land
And I've got a home in that yonder city, good Lord
And it's not (good Lordy it's not) not made by hand

I got a mother, a sister and a brother
Who have gone to that sweet home
And I am determined to go and see them, good Lord
Over on (good Lordy over on) that distant shore

As I go down to that river Jordan
Just to bathe my weary soul
If I could touch but just the hem of His garment, good Lord
I believe (good Lordy I believe) that it would make me whole

Now when I'm dead, laying in my coffin
All of my friends all gather round
They can say that he's just laying there sleeping, good Lord
Sweet peace (Lordy sweet peace) his soul is found",I Am a Pilgrim [*],1956
Merle Travis,"So round, so firm, so fully packed, that's my gal
So complete, front to back, that's my pal
Toasted by the sun and I'm a son of a gun
She don't make my five o'clock shadow come around at one.

You can bet your boots had walked for miles, through the snow
Just to see her tooth faced smile they mentioned on the radio
If you don't think she's lot of fun just as the man who once wants
So round, so firm, so fully packed, that's my gal.

So round, so firm, so fully packed, she's for me
She's just like a money bag guarantee
Like a barfly goes for drink, like a bobysocks go for Frank
And just like Jesse James, he goes for money in the bank.

From head to foot she's a perfect size, she's a wist
But she wears a forty-five gun that is
She's got a look that's so impressin'
She's got furs that's sorta fashion
So round, so firm, so fully packed, that's my gal...",So Round So Firm So Fully Packed,1962
Merle Travis,"Little Lilly was oh! So silly and shy
And all the fellows knew,
She wouldn't bill and coo:
Ev'ry single night some smart fellow would try 
o cuddle up to her, but she would cry:
 
""Ma, he's making eyes at me!
Ma he's awful nice to me!
Ma he's almost breaking my heart,
I'm beside him, Mercy!
Let his conscience guide him!
Ma, he wants to marry me,
Be my honey bee.
Ev'ry minute he gets bolder,
Now he's leaning on my shoulder,
Ma, he's kissing me!""
 
Lilly was so good, ev'ry body could tell.
You'd never see her roam,
She'd always stay at home;
All the neighbors knew little Lilly too well.
For when the boys would call, They'd hear her yell:
 
Ma, he's making eyes at me!
Ma he's awful nice to me!
Ma he's almost breaking my heart,
If you peek in, Can't you see I'm goin' to weaken?
Ma, he wants to marry me,
Be my honey bee.
Ma, I'm meeting with resistance, 
I shall holler for assistance,
Ma, he's kissing me!""

Merle Travis,"I could show the world how to smile
I could be glad all of the while
I could change the grey skies to blues 
If I had you
I could leave the old days behind
Leave all my pals, I'd never mind
I could start my life all a new 
If I had you
I could climb the snow capped mountains
Sail the mighty ocean wide
I could cross the burning desert
If I had you by my side
I could be a king, dear, uncrowned
Humble or poor, rich or renowned
There is nothing I couldn't do

Merle Travis,"This nine pound hammer, it's a little too heavy
For my size, baby, for my size
I'm goin' on the mountain, gonna see my baby
But I ain't comin' back, well, I ain't comin' back

Roll on buddy, don't you roll so slow
Tell me, how can I roll, when the wheels won't go?
Roll on buddy, pull a load of coal
Now, how can I pull, when wheels won't roll?

It's a long way to Harlan, it's a long way to Hazard
Just to get a little brew, just to get a little brew
Well, when I'm long gone you can make my tombstone
Outta number nine coal, outta number nine coal

Merle Travis,"Who's Sorry Now?
Who's Sorry Now?
Who's heart is aching for breaking each vow?
Who's sad and blue?

Just like a friend,
I tried to warn you somehow.
You had your way,
Now you must pay;

Merle Travis,"There's a garden, what a garden
Only happy faces bloom there
And there's never any room there
For a worry or a gloom there

Oh there's music and there's dancing
And a lot of sweet romancing
When they play the polka
They all get in the swing

Every time they hear that oom-pa-pa
Everybody feels so tra-la-la
They want to throw their cares away
They all go lah-de-ah-de-ay

Then they hear a rumble on the floor, the floor
It's the big surprise they're waiting for
And all the couples form a ring
For miles around you'll hear them sing

Roll out the barrel, we'll have a barrel of fun
Roll out the barrel, we've got the blues on the run
Sing boom tararra, ring out a song of good cheer
Now's the time to roll the barrel, for the gang's all here

Merle Travis,"Deep within my heart lies a melody
A song of old San Antone
Where in dreams I live with a memory
Beneath the stars all alone
It was there I found beside the Alamo
Enchantment strange as the blue up above
A moonlit pass that only she would know
Still hears my broken song of love
Moon in all your splendor know only my heart
Call back my rose, rose of San Antone
Lips so sweet and tender like petals falling apart
Speak once again of my love, my own.
Broken song, empty words I know
Still live in my heart all alone
For that moonlit pass by the Alamo
And Rose, my Rose of San Antone
Deep within my heart lies a melody,
A song of old San Antone
Where in dreams I live with a memory
Beneath the stars all alone
It was there I found beside the Alamo
Enchantment strange as the blue up above
A moonlit pass that only she would know

With the roses so red and the lilies so fair 
And the myrtles so bright with emerald dew

Oh, I'll dance, I will sing and my laugh shall be gay 
I will charm ev'ry heart, in his crown I will sway 
When I woke from my dreaming, idols were clay 
All portions of love then had all flown away. 
Oh, he taught me to love him and promised to love 
And to cherish me over all others above 
How my heart now is wond'ring misery can tell 
He's left me no warning, no words of farewell.

The kind of ditty that invokes the spring.

Sweet and lovely heaven must have sent her my way
Skies above me never were as blue as her eyes

There's a thrill that words cannot express
In my heart a song of love is taunting me, melody, haunting me
Sweet and lovely sweeter than the roses in May

Hello there stranger how do you do
there's something I'd like to say to you
You seem surprised I recognize
I'm no detective but I just surmise

You're from the place I'm longing to be
your smiling face seems to say to me
You're from my homeland my sunny homeland
tell me can it be?

Are you from Dixie I say from Dixie where the fields of
cotton beckon to me
I'm glad to see you tell me I'll be you and the friend
I'm longing to see
Are you from Alabama Tennessee or Caroline
Any place below the Mason Dixon Line
Are you from Dixie I say from Dixie 'cause I'm from Dixie
too.

It was a way back in old '89
When first I crossed that Mason Dixon Line
Gee but again I long to return
To those good old folks I left behind

On the plantation near Birmingham
and there's one thing certain I'm surely flirtin'
With those southbound trains",Are You from Dixie,1985

Merle Travis,"Oh come all you young fellers so young and so fine
Seek not your fortune in a dark dreary mine
It'll form as a habit and seep in your soul
Till the stream of your blood runs as black as the coal
Where it's dark as a dungeon damp as the dew danger is double pleasures are few
Where the rain never falls the sun never shines
It's a dark as a dungeon way down in the mine

Well it's many a man that I've seen in my day
(uh huh no laughin' during this song please it's bein' recorded)
Like a fiend with his dope and a drunkard with his wine
A man will have lust for the lure of the mine

Eight more miles on this old road and I'll never more be blue

Eight more miles to Louisville the home town of my heart

There's bound to be a girl somewhere that you like best of all
Mine lives down in Louisville she's long and she is tall
But she's the kind that you can't find a rambling through the land

Now I can picture in my mind a place we'll call our home
A humble little hut for two we'll never want to roam
The place that's right for that love site is in those bluegrass hills
Where gently flows the Ohio by a place called Louisville

When flowers were a-bloomin'
Sweet Willie on his deathbed lay
For the love of Barbara Allen

He sent his servant to the town
The town where she did dwell in
Saying ""Master dear has sent me here
It remained for Barbara Allen""

Then slowly slowly she got up
And slowly she went to him
And all she said when she got there
""Young man, I think you're dying""

""Oh don't you remember the other day
When we were in the tavern?
You drank your health to the ladies there
And you slighted Barbara Allen""

He turned his face unto the wall
He turned his back upon her
""Adieu! Adieu! To all my friends
Be kind to Barbara Allen""

She looked to the east, She looked to the west
She saw his corpse a-comin'
""Oh sit him down for me"" she cried
""That I may gaze upon him""

The more she looked the more she grieved
She bursted out to cryin'
Sayin' ""pick me up and carry me home
For I feel like I am dyin'""

They buried Willie in the old churchyard
And Barbara in the new one
From Willie's grave there grew a rose
From Barbara's a green briar

They grew and grew to the old church wall
And could not grow no higher
And there they died in a true love-knot

For dreams have so often come true.

He was turning away from her side.
But she threw her small arms around daddy's neck;
She gave him a kiss and then cried:

And the men all fought for their lives.

Was covered with sweethearts and wives.""

[Chorus]
""Darlin', say that you'll be mine;
In our home we'll happy be,
Down beside where the waters flow,
On the banks of the Ohio.""

I took her by her pretty white hand,
I led her down the banks of sand,
I plunged her in
Where she would drown,
An' watched her as she floated down.

[Chorus]

Returnin' home between twelve and one,
Thinkin', Lord, what a deed I've done;
I'd killed the girl
I love, you see,
Because she would not marry me.

The very next day, at half past four,
The sheriff walked right to my door;
He says, ""Young man,
Don't try to run.
You'll pay for this awful crime you've don.""

I met little Sadie and I shot her down
Went back home and I got in my bed
Forty four pistol under my head

Wake up next morning 'bout a half past nine
The hacks and the buggies all standing in line
Gents and the gamblers standing all round
Taking little Sadie to her burying ground

Then I begin to think what a deed I'd done
I grabbed my hat and away I run
Made a good run but a little too slow
They overtook me in Jericho

I was standing on the corner, reading the bill
When up stepped the sheriff from Thomasville
He said, young man, ain't your name Brown?
Remember the night you shot Sadie down?

I said, yes, sir, my name is Lee
I murdered little Sadie in the first degree
And first degree and the second degree
If you got any papers, won't you read 'em to me?

They took me downtown and dressed me in black
Put me on the train and started me back
They crammed me back in that Thomasville jail
And I had no money for to go my bail

That judge and the jury, they took their stand
The judge had the papers in his right hand
Forty one days and forty one nights
Forty one years to wear the ball and the stripes

From the green old flowing mountains to the south down along the shore

From New York to St. Louis and old Chicago by the way
To the hills of Minnesota where them rippling waters fall

In the hills of Tennessee many places throughout the land
When his earthly race are over and them curtains 'round him fall

As we rolled into that station I heard somebody say
There's a boy from Carolina, they're wide and fat and tall

She was oh so far from a chunk of ice 
And our smoochin' party was a goin' real nice

How John Lewis did murder poor little Omie Wise.
He told her to meet him at Adams's Springs.
He promised her money and other fine things.

So, fool-like she met him at Adams's Springs.
No money he brought her nor other fine things.

""Go with me, little Omie, and away we will go.
We'll go and get married and no one will know.""

She climbed up behind him and away they did go,
But off to the river where deep waters flow.

""John Lewis, John Lewis, will you tell me your mind?
Do you intend to marry me or leave me behind?""

""Little Omie, little Omie, I'll tell you my mind.
My mind is to drown you and leave you behind.""

""Have mercy on my baby and spare me my life,
I'll go home as a beggar and never be your wife.""

He kissed her and hugged her and turned her around,
Then pushed her in deep waters where he knew that she would drown.

He got on his pony and away he did ride,
As the screams of little Omie went down by his side.

T'was on a Thursday morning, the rain was pouring down,
When the people searched for Omie but she could not be found.

Two boys went a-fishin' one fine summer day,
And saw little Omie's body go floating away.

They threw their net around her and drew her to the bank.
Her clothes all wet and muddy, they laid her on a plank.

Then sent for John Lewis to come to that place --
And brought her out before him so that he might see her face.

He made no confession but they carried him to jail,
No friends or relations would go on his bail.

While I've got money to spend
Tomorrow might be Monday 
And I'd neither have a dollar nor a friend 
Well I've got plenty of money in my pocket
My good time friends are around 
But as soon as my pocketbook is empty
Not a friend on this earth can be found 
I wrote my little woman a letter good people
And I told her I was in jail
She sent me back an answer
Sayin honey I'm a coming go your bail
But I'm still walking round 
This old jail house this evening
Forty dollars won't pay my fine
Corn whiskey has surrounded my body poor boy
And my woman is troubling my mind
Lord my daddy told me a pretty good people
And my momma she told me more
Said son if you don't quit your rowdy ways
You'll have trouble at your door
If it wasn't for heartaches and trouble good people
Lord I would not be here today
I will ramble this whole world over
At home I cannot stay
Give me corn bread
On the table when I'm hungry
Something tall and cool when I'm dry
And a true loving woman to stand by me
Sweet heaven when I die
Go dig a hole in the meadow good people
Make it deep in that cold cold ground
Then gather around all you kind friends 
And see this poor rounder go down
And when I'm dead and they buried me
With my pale face turned to the sun
Will you stand around and moan little woman
And think of the way you have done

I'll sing it to you right, but you may sing it wrong,
All about a man named Otto Wood,
I can't tell you all, but I wish I could.

He walked in a pawn shop a rainy day,
And with the clerk he had a quarrel, they say.
Pulled out his pistol and he struck him a blow,
And this is the way the story goes.

They spread the news as fast as they could,
The sheriff served a warrant on Otto Wood.
The jury said murder in the second degree,
And the judge passed the sentence to the penitentiary.

[Chorus]
Otto, why didn't you run?
Otto's done dead and gone.
Otto Wood, why didn't you run
When the sheriff pulled out his 44 gun?

They put him in the pen, but it done no good,
It wouldn't hold the man they call Otto Wood.
It wasn't very long till he slipped outside,
Drawed a gun on the guard, said, ""Take me for a ride.""

Second time they caught him was away out west,
In the holdup game, he got shot through the breast.
They brought him back and when he got well,
They locked him down in a dungeon cell.

He was a man they could not run,
He always carried a 44 gun.
He loved the women and he hated the law,
And he just wouldn't take nobody's jaw.

He rambled out west and he rambled all around,
He met the sheriff in a southern town.
And the sheriff says, ""Otto, step this way,
'Cause I've been expecting you every day.""

He pulled out his gun and then he said,
""If you make a crooked move, you both fall dead.
Crank up your car and take me out of town,""
And a few minutes later, he was graveyard bound.",Otto Wood the Bandit,1999

They call the Rising Sun
And it's been the ruin of a many poor boy
And me, oh God, for one

Then fill the glasses to the brim
Let the drinks go merrily around
And we'll drink to the health of a rounder poor boy
Who goes from town to town

The only thing that a rounder needs
Is a suitcase and a trunk
And the only time he's satisfied
Is when he's on a drunk

Now boys, don't believe what a girl tells you
Though her eyes be blue or brown
Unless she's on some scaffold high
Saying, ""Boys, I can't come down""

Go tell my youngest brother
Not to do the things I've done
But to shun that house down in New Orleans
They call the Rising Sun

For my race is nearly run
Gonna spend the rest of my wicked life

And invitations to teenage parties
""Dress in white"" one said, with quotations
From someone's wife, a famous writer
In the nineteen-twenties
When you're young you find inspiration
In anyone who's ever gone
And opened up a closing door
She said: ""We were never feeling bored

'Cause we were never being boring
We had too much time to find for ourselves
And we were never being boring
We dressed up and fought, then thought: ""Make amends""
And we were never holding back or worried that
Time would come to an end""

When I went I left from the station
With a haversack and some trepidation
Someone said: ""If you're not careful
You'll have nothing left and nothing to care for
In the nineteen-seventies""
But I sat back and looking forward
My shoes were high and I had scored
I'd bolted through a closing door
I would never find myself feeling bored

'Cause we were never being boring
We had too much time to find for ourselves
And we were never being boring
We dressed up and fought, then thought: ""Make amends""
And we were never holding back or worried that
Time would come to an end
We were always hoping that, looking back
You could always rely on a friend

Now I sit with different faces
In rented rooms and foreign places
All the people I was kissing
Some are here and some are missing

The creature that I always meant to be
But I thought in spite of dreams
You'd be sitting somewhere here with me

But where does she go
And who really knows the girl deep inside
The one she always tries to hide

Julie, Julie don't you know
You're riding on a carousel
That's going no where round and round
And round when will it end
Don't ever be afraid
To ride upon the biggest pony
Open up the gates and let it carry you away

She works so hard without a break
But every now and then she dreams
Of all, the lovely places she could go
She wonders if she will ever arrive

Merril Bainbridge,"I was only happy when you drove me crazy 
Everything about you made me feel so lazy 
I never felt so good and yet I feel so bad 
You were the strangest lover that I ever had 

But now I miss you 
Yes, I miss you now you're gone 
You were always telling me just 
What I should wear 
I was always combing all the knots 
From your hair 
You're like a fisherman 
Your hook could pull me in 
Put me in a fry pan couldn't wait 
To burn my skin but now I miss you 

But now I miss you 
Yes I miss you now you're gone 
Every Sunday we would laugh a lot 
Making love and breakfast in bed 
You were grumpy when you had to get up 
I would have to toss a coin 
To see who'd make the bed 

I remember when you 
Broke my favourite tea cup 
You'd just smile that silly smile 
It made me upset 
We used to fight a lot but 
What a time we had 
And when I think about those days 
They're not so bad 
'Cause now I miss you 
Yes I miss you 
I'll always miss you 
Now you're gone

Merril Bainbridge,"He opens up my mind
In a way nobody else has ever
He opens up my dreams
And now the life I see is so much brighter

What makes it so one can touch another
In such a way
We underestimate the beauty and the power
Of one, of one

He opens up my fears
To degrees I never thought existed
And he opens up my heart
To relieve the many pains afflicted

What makes it so one can touch another
In such a way
We underestimate the beauty and the power
Of one

We weren't meant to be alone
Though alone this life we leave and enter
In existence of the flesh
We all need to feel a hand that's tender

One hand one heart can affect another
In such a way
We underestimate the beauty and the power
Of one, of one, of one

Merril Bainbridge,"I finally found the reasons why
Everything I feel inside
Feelings that I cannot hide
Tell me that it's you

Got me acting kinda strange
Like I'm on a different plane
I never thought I could explain
But I know that it's love

I finally found the reason why
Rainbow colors fill the air
People always stop and stare
Whenever I'm with you

Suddenly the flowers bloom
Whistling a happy tune
I never thought I'd understand
But now I know it's love

'Cause when you smile
And look at me, then suddenly
I know why the birds
Keep singing every place I go

I finally found the reason why
Everything is upside down
My feet don't even touch the ground
But now I know that it's love

'Cause when you smile
And look at me, then suddenly
I know why the birds
Keep singing every place I go

I finally found the reason why

Merril Bainbridge,"Little flower how you've grown so fast
Seems like only yesterday
Little flower how your beauty lasts
It always will to me

Floating in around the trees
Flighty as an autumn breeze
Nothing has upset you
All the pain has left you

Little flower lying in the sun
How you soak up every ray
Little flower take it while you're young
It may never shine again

When you open up I see
What a gift you've given me
Nothing has upset you
All the pain has left you

Little flower have you grown to be
Everything you wanted
Little flower is your earth complete
It always seems to be

What we give we reap and sow
Closer to me that you know
I could never let you go
I would never want to

Merril Bainbridge,"My sentiment will bore you senseless I know 
But I've got to tell you something 
I want to be a satellite to your world 
Spinning in the universe 

When all the pleasures in heaven are yours 
You can take what you want from me 
You got me spinning around you 
You got me spinning around you 

Look at me I'm a bony bit of skinny confidence 
But that might be my photograph 
From the top of the highest peak you can watch me Spinning in the universe 

When all the pleasures in heaven are yours 
You can take what you want from me 

My sentiment still bores you senseless I know 
But I've got to show you something I found 
Here's a photo of an astronaut 
And there's you and me spinning in the background

Merril Bainbridge,"Where do I go from here?
Or am I just like a clock spinning 'round?
Everything seems unclear
Confusion is raising its head and I can't make a sound

And I feel it
Tearing at my soul while I'm asleep
I feel it
Driving me to something I'll regret

What if I make the change?
What if I lose all my courage this time?
Everything seems so strange
Try but I can't seem to make a decision that's right

I feel it
Pounding like a drum inside my brain
I feel it
If it doesn't stop I'll go insane

I feel it
Tearing at my soul while I'm asleep

Driving me to something I'll regret

We were in a room with 
Sunshine in my eyes and 
Water on the floor

Walking around we were 
Foolin' around in the garden 
In the garden there I saw you turn around 
And still you turn around

Since I was just a little boy
I liked to roam the hills
And to hear wild stories about the Indians
Was my biggest thrill

I'd shout and yell and holler like heck
I wore moccasins on my feet
And I'd make believe I was under a teepee
Every time I went to sleep

My hair was jet black and I was twenty-one

Around my Cochise County hometown

One day I went to the reservation
And there by a shallow creek
Was a beautiful Indian a-fetchin' water
And I just had to speak

She smiled at me then quickly left
But the next day she returned
And it wasn't very long till I told her how
The love in my heart burned

{Son, don't go near the Indians
Please stay away
Son, don't go near the Indians
Please do what I say}

I told my daddy I'd found a girl
Who meant the world to me
And tomorrow I'd ask the Indian chief
For the hand of NovaLee

Dad's trembling lips spoke softly
As he told me of my life
Twas then he said I could never take
This maiden for my wife

SPOKEN:
Son, the white man and Indianss were fighting when you were born
And a brave called Yellow Sun scalped my little boy
So I stole you to get even for what he'd done
Though you're a full-blooded Indian, son
I love you as much as my own little feller that's dead
And, son, NovaLee is your sister
And that's why I've always said

Wer weiß wie lange wir euch noch nerven
Wir bereiten Kopfschmerzen und wir sind dreist Digga

Ich bin ein Ausländer
Ich bekomm schon Pickel von dem Çekirdek
Ane wieso schon wieder Mercimek
Und dann muss ich mir wieder anhören
Dass wir es besser haben
Weil wir Essen haben
Und in Betten schlafen

Ich hatte in der Schule keine Butterbrote
Die Deutschen hatten immer so 'ne Tupperdose
Im Auto stauen sich die Pfandflaschen
Sogar meine Mutter hat 'ne Basey in der Handtasche
Sie regt sich immer auf wenn ich nicht Zuhause esse
Jede Ausländische Oma hat 'ne Augenschwäche
Jeder Ausländische Opa hat noch kraft
Und obwohl ich sein Enkel bin glaube ich dass er mich hasst

Dass mein Vater mich erwischt is' das Risiko
Doch wir fahren zu zehnt auf 'nem Fahrrad zu Tipico
Ich bin ein scheiß Boxerschnitt träger
Und du bist so ein Opfer ähh wie Lehrer

Wir sind Ausländer
Ihr könnt uns alle in ein Topf werfen
Wir bereiten Kopfschmerzen ich weiß

Liebe oder was?
Ach, Bruder, ich sag dir mal was ich von Liebe halte

Ich war noch nie verliebt (ich war noch nie verliebt)
In mei'm Herz die Familie, im Kopf die Musik
Frauen, die ich treffe, sind nur Schocktherapie
Ich hab' Angst um meine Zukunft und keinen Bock mehr auf die
Ihr seid alle nur dem Geld hinterher
Deshalb schieße ich nur ungern und selten ins Herz
Ich hab' gelernt, ohne dass ich es am eignen Leib spüre
Du willst dich treffen? Danke, aber nein, Süße
Ich hab' Angst, Angst vor der Liebe
Ich hab' Angst davor, dass ich keine Antworten kriege
Sag mir, wo ist das vernünftige Mädchen
Was mich auch immer dazu bringt, jeden Tag fünfmal zu beten?
In den Kreisen, wo ich lebe, werd' ich so eine nicht daten
Ich lern' nur Frauen kennen, die Fame wollen und Pics faken
Und trotzdem seht ihr so wie Missgeburten aus
Wenn der Teufel dich nicht überzeugt, dann schickt er eine Frau

Langsam wird es Zeit, dass du dich entscheidest
Willst du Party, willst du, dass du frei bist?
Oder willst du grenzenlose Liebe?
Sag mir, was bringt dein ganzes Kämpfen, ohne Ziele?
Ich weiß es selbst nicht, ich liebe, wenn das Geld spricht
Denn zu Geld hab' ich ein gutes Verhältnis
Eine Sache check' ich bei dem Thema nicht
Wenn wir alle gleich sind, wieso seid ihr dann so wählerisch?

Diese Liebe ist 'ne sichere Enttäuschung
Viele kennen nicht mal die richtige Bedeutung
Liebe heißt Loyalität und Zusamm'nhalt
Das bedeutet wir werden zusammen alt
Liebe heißt, auf vieles zu verzichten
Sich für Höhen und für Tiefen zu verpflichten
Liebe heißt, fick deine Shishacafés
Diskotheken oder Clubs wirst du niemals mehr sehen
Liebe heißt Loyalität auch in Kriesenzeit
Liebe heißt, dass keiner von uns beiden liegen bleibt
Liebe heißt, wir bleiben bis aufs Letzte treu
Es gibt nur einen Mann für dich, du hast keinen besten Freund
Liebe heißt, zusammen durch das Feuer gehen
Ich muss mir sicher sein, ich kann auf deine Treue zählen
Liebe heißt, ich ticke für dich aus
Wenn der Glaube dich nicht überzeugt, dann schickt er eine Frau

Langsam wird es Zeit, dass du dich entscheidest
Willst du Party, willst du, dass du frei bist?
Oder willst du grenzenlose Liebe?
Sag mir, was bringt dein ganzes Kämpfen, ohne Ziele?

Du siehst noch mehr Abturn ohne Make-up aus
Nix gegen dich, aber ich finde es auch schlecht
Wenn du die Schminke drauf lässt, wieso trinkst du auf Ex?
Wieso genau ich, wieso lässt du mich nicht in Ruh?
Du kriegst nicht genug, irgendwann ist doch mal gut
Ich hab' keine Nerven dazu, dass mich irgendwelche Weiber nerven
Fick mal nicht Kopf, du findest keinen Platz in meinem Herzen
Traust dich vor mein Haus und an die Türe zu klopfen
Du benimmst dich wie ein geisteskranker Psycho, du Fotze
Ich hab' dir oft gesagt, du brauchst nicht vor dem Studio warten
Hatte niemals vor, mit dir kleinen Hure zu schlafen

Bis mein Vater mir zeigte, dass dieses Leben mehr kann
Wegen ihm haben wir heute was zu essen
Er hat gesagt, „Du darfst deine Träume nie vergessen!“
Wurde oft verraten, tja, viel zu oft verraten
Echte Freunde? Wie soll ich in sowas Hoffnung haben?
Lieber Gott, ich entscheide mich zu offenbaren
Die Geister, die ich rief, kosteten mich Kopf und Kragen
Und das Wort „Liebe“ ist mir fremd
Denn seit neuestem lebt meine ganze Familie getrennt
Mama fand ihr Zuhause in Türkei
Alles Geld, was ich habe, tausche ich für Zeit
Und dreh' die Zeit zurück, ja, wenigstens 'n kleines Stück
Dass ich nicht glücklich bin, das ist vielleicht verrückt
Doch was bringt mir Ruhm und Erfolg, Mama?
Mich so zu sehen, hättest du nicht gewollt, Mama
Ich reise rum, weil ich mich nirgendswo mehr wohlfühle
Bin zwar wach, aber tief im Inneren todmüde
Fahr' von Stadt zu Stadt und lenke mich ab
Hab' mir sogar schon selber ein paar Geschenke gemacht
Möchte nicht zurück, denn unser Haus steht leer
Und all die schönen Erinnerungen gibt's auch nicht mehr
Es gibt keine Zeile, die ich lüge
Das beweisen meine Tränen, wenn ich weine auf der Bühne

Mein Wagen kostet fünfzig Mille und bringt mich von A nach B
Wohin ich will, aber leider nicht auf den graden Weg
Mein Erfolg brachte mich an tausend Bitches
Aber keine, wo mir Mama sagte, „Diese Frau ist richtig!“

So manche Dinge kann ich heute erst verstehen
Das Glänzen meiner Mutters Augen sind nicht Freude, sondern Tränen
Für manche Dinge sollte ich mich schämen
Papa sagte es vorher, aber ich wollte es nicht sehen
So viel Fehler gemacht, so viel Sünden begangen
Du willst 'ne gute Frau? Sei erstmal ein vernünftiger Mann
Das Geld, der Erfolg und der Benz waren meine Ziele
Heute habe ich mehr Fotos mit meinen Fans als mit Familie
Ich ess' in Restaurants und habe Para wie bekloppt
Doch was würd' ich dafür geben, nur, dass Mama mir was kocht?
In manchen Augen bin ich zwar ein Superstar
Doch bin traurig darüber, dass ich nicht so wie mein Bruder war
Ich bin hier und da und hab' nie richtig Fuß gefasst

Ich bin kein Mann, der dir Schlechtes will

Du bist mir nicht egal, ich muss eingestehen
Ich will dich ungerne leiden sehen
Du hättest so etwas nicht verdient
Denn ich bin kein Mann, der dich richtig liebt
Ich nehm' dich zum Trost in die Arme

Am Anfang war ich noch so leichtsinnig, aber dann ging mir ein Licht auf

Hoffentlich trifft es mich nicht
Hätt' ich mal auf meine Eltern gehört

Wenn du kämpfst, dann hat sich nämlich jeder Monat gelohnt

Gib nicht auf, denn ein Ziel ist nur ein Traum mit Termin
Manchmal klingt es so, als wäre aufgeben grad das sinnvollste
Doch eines Tages bist du dort, wo du hinwolltest
Auf dem Weg nach oben fragen sie dich: „Wohin?“
Willst du an die Quelle kommen, musst du gegen den Strom schwimmen
Steine auf dem Weg, was tust du dagegen?
Du musst kämpfen, Bruder, keiner schlägt so zu wie das Leben
An manchen Tagen bist du innerlich tot
Doch wenn dein Körper nicht mehr kann, dann zieht dein Wille ihn hoch

When all the lights are low
May not be new, but I like it,

I like Jack Benny's jokes.
To a degree.
I love the common folks.
That includes me.
I like to window shop on 5th Avenue.
I like banana splits, late supper at the Ritz,
How about you?
I love to dream of fame, maybe I'll shine.

With every sigh I become more mad about you
More lost without you and so it goes

C'est nous contre ceux d'en haut

Pour une couronne qu'on récupère
Un jour meilleur qui reste à faire
Des chants qui se relèvent de terre
Au pied d'une croix sans cimetière
Pour l'injustice qu'en finit pas
De nous briser entre ses doigts
Un bras de fer, un gant de soie,
Sur ce qu'on perd et qu'on n'a pas

On est de ceux qui ont ouvert
Une autre voie, une nouvelle ère,
On est l'écho, le souffle d'air,
De tous ces gens qu'on dit à terre

Contre ceux d'en haut
C'est contre ceux d'en haut
A mains nues s'il le faut
Qu'on gagnera notre place
Contre ceux d'en haut
C'est contre leurs ego

Merwan Rim,"Il suffira d'un signe, un matin
Un matin tout tranquille et serein
Quelque chose d'infime, c'est certain
C'est écrit dans nos livres, en latin

Déchirées nos guenilles de vauriens
Les fers à nos chevilles loin bien loin
Tu ris mais sois tranquille un matin
J'aurai tout ce qui brille dans mes mains

Regarde ma vie tu la vois face à face
Dis moi ton avis que veux-tu que j'y fasse
Nous n'avons plus que ça au bout de notre impasse
Le moment viendra tout changera de place

Merwan Rim,"Sur une arme les doigts noués
Pour agresser, serrer les poings
Mais nos paumes sont pour aimer
Y'a pas de caresse en fermant les mains

Longues, jointes en une prière
Bien ouvertes pour acclamer
Dans un poing les choses à soustraire
On ne peut rien tendre les doigts pliés

Quand on ouvre nos mains
Suffit de rien dix fois rien
Suffit d'une ou deux secondes
À peine un geste, un autre monde
Quand on ouvre nos mains

Mécanique simple et facile
Des veines et dix métacarpiens
Des phalanges aux tendons dociles
Et tu relâches ou bien tu retiens

Et des ongles faits pour griffer
Poussent au bout du mauvais côté
Celui qui menace ou désigne
De l'autre on livre nos vies dans des lignes

Quand on ouvre nos mains
Suffit de rien dix fois rien
(Suffit de rien dix fois rien)
Suffit d'une ou deux secondes
A peine un geste, un autre monde
Quand on ouvre nos mains

Un simple geste d'humain
Quand se desserrent ainsi nos poings
Quand s'écartent nos phalanges
Sans méfiance, une arme d'échange
Des champs de bataille en jardin

Le courage du signe indien
Un cadeau d'hier à demain
Rien qu'un instant d'innocence
Un geste de reconnaissance
Quand on ouvre comme un écrin

Meryem Saci,"On avance dans la vie, prêts à faire ce qu'il faut
Et parfois sur la route, la foi nous fait défaut
Même si la tâche est rude, les murs bien trop hauts
On sait qu'un jour ou l'autre, il fera bien plus beau

Y'a toujours ce feu qui brûle même si on ne le sent pas
Cette voix au fond qui crie même si on ne l'entend pas
Ce sourire qui revient éclairer nos visages
Même après de fortes pluies et de sombres orages

Et peu importe les croche-pattes que le destin fera, les coups qu'il portera
Y'a des coeurs qui sont des forteresses
Ce feu là rejaillit quand on y croit plus
Que vaincues nos âmes coulent dans le bitume

Toucher le soi, en général on s'en remet
On en renaît pas toujours plus fort, mais on fait l'effort
Faut maintenir la soif, celle du lendemain
Y'a pas de mais, à nouveau se relever sinon c'est mort

Combien de fois on s'est dit, ça y est ce coup-là c'est fini?
Ces jours où il y avait plus de force ou plus d'envie
Mais je crois que c'est écrit dans nos gènes, comme respirer
On se remettra toujours en selle, prêts à transpirer

Et résister, comme aspirés par cette route sinueuse, capricieuse
Brillante ou pas, on sait bien qu'elle demeure trop précieuse
Truffée de bosses et crevasses mais on trace quand même
On vera sur place ou tout ça nous mène
Et c'est ce feu qui nous y pousse
Qui nous force à rester en course
On croise beaucoup de raisons de baisser les armes
Mais ce feu-là est fait de flammes qui résistent aux larmes, alors, hun

On marche sur ce fil en priant le très haut
Et chaque jours l'espoir allège nos fardeaux
On garde le sourire même quand nos barques prennent l'eau
On sait qu'un jour ou l'autre, il fera bien plus beau

Certains soirs je me couche
J'ai l'impression d'avoir un poids qui pèse lourd sur la poitrine
Qui me bloque et vole mon souffle
Je veux ma liberté comme Kunta dans Racines

Ils ont mis des barrières où on courrait jadis
Schengen, ils haïssent et disent : Quo Vadis
Faut montrer patte blanche
Le rêve occidental, bienvenue entre quatre planches

Après la mer? Rien, nos dirigeants que font-ils? Rien
A part nous chanter leurs comptines
Je mesure ma chance, même si j'avais deux balles en poche
Grâce au Selecto vide à la consigne

Je les entends douter de ma foi
Mon père me disait lâche prise et bats toi
Je crie jusqu'à défoncer ma voix
Non je ne laisserai personne me voler ma joie

Comme à l'époque sur la plage
Un grand connard venait pour piétiner mon château
Il aurait dû manger du sable
Mais bon, le château je l'ai refait en deux fois plus beau

Meryl Streep,"Here's to us
One more toast
And then we'll pay the bill
Deep inside
Both of us
Can feel the autumn chill
Birds of passage
You and me
We fly instinctively
When the summer's over
And the dark clouds hide the sun
Neither you nor I'm to blame
When all is said and done

In our lives
We have walked
Some strange and lonely treks
Slightly worn
But dignified
And not too old for sex
We're still striving for the sky
No taste for humble pie
Thanks for all your generous love
And thanks for all the fun
Neither you nor I'm to blame
When all is said and done

It's so strange
When you're down
And lying on the floor
How you rise
Shake your head
Get up and ask for more

With nothing left untried
Standing calmly at the crossroads
No desire to run
There's no hurry any more

Meryl Streep,"I don't wanna talk
About the things we've gone through
Though it's hurting me
Now it's history
I've played all my cards
And that's what you've done too
Nothing more to say
No more ace to play

The winner takes it all
The loser standing small
Beside the victory
That's her destiny

I was in your arms
Thinking I belonged there
I figured it made sense
Building me a fence
Building me a home
Thinking I'd be strong there
But I was a fool
Playing by the rules

The gods may throw a dice
Their minds as cold as ice
And someone way down here
Loses someone dear
The winner takes it all
The loser has to fall
It's simple and it's plain
Why should I complain

But tell me does she kiss
Like I used to kiss you
Does it feel the same
When she calls your name
Somewhere deep inside
You must know I miss you
But what can I say
Rules must be obeyed

The judges will decide
The likes of me abide
Spectators of the show
Always staying low
The game is on again
A lover or a friend
A big thing or a small
The winner takes it all

I don't wanna talk
If it makes you feel sad

You've come to shake my hand
I apologize
If it makes you feel bad
Seeing me so tense
No self-confidence

It's the last wish

Had to get your cow

Separate and alone

I was given those beans!
You persuaded me to trade away
My cow for beans!
And without those beans
There'd have been no stalk
To get up to the giant's
In the first place!

Wait a minute, magic beans
For a cow so old
That you had to tell
A lie to sell it
Which you told!
Were they worthless beans?
Were they oversold?
Oh, and tell us who persuaded you
To steal that gold

See, it's your fault
No!
Yes, it's you fault
No!
Yes, it is!
It's not!
It's true

Wait a minute
But I only stole the gold
To get my cow back
From you!

So it's your fault!
Yes!
No, it isn't!
I'd have kept those beans
But our house was cursed
She made us get the cow to get
The curse reversed!

It's his father's fault
That the curse got placed
And the place got cursed
In the first place!

Oh!
Then it's his fault!
So
It was his fault!
No
Yes, it is
It's his
I guess

Wait a minute, though
I chopped down the beanstalk
Right, that's clear?
But without any beanstalk
Then what's queer
Is how did the second giant get down here
In the first place?
Second place?

Yes!
How?
Hmmm
Well,
Who had the other bean?
The other bean?
The other bean?
You pocketed the other bean
I didn't!
Yes I did
So it's your-
No, it isn't
'Cause I gave it to my wife!
So it's her fault!
No, it isn't!
Then whose is it?
Wait a minute!
She exchanged that bean
To obtain your shoe
So the one who knows what happened
To that bean is you!
You mean that old bean
That your wife, oh, dear
But I never knew,
And so I threw-
Well, don't look here!

So it's your fault!
But-
See, it's her fault!
But-
And it isn't mine at all!
But what?
Well, if you hadn't gone
Back up again
We were needy
You were greedy!
Did you need that hen?
But I got it for my mother!
So it's her fault then!
Yes, and what about the harp
In the third place?
The harp, yes!
She went and dared me to!
I dared you to?
You dared me to!
She said that I was scared
So she dared me!
No, I didn't!

Meryl Streep,"Must have left my house at eight, because I always do
My train, I'm certain, left the station just when it was due
I must have read the morning papers going into town
And having gotten through the editorials, no doubt I must have frowned
I must have made my desk around a quarter after nine
With letters to be read, and heaps of papers waiting to be signed
I must have gone to lunch at half past twelve or so
The usual place, the usual bunch
And still on top of this I'm pretty sure it must have rained
The day before you came

I must have lit my seventh cigarette at half past two
And at the time I never even noticed I was blue
I must have kept on dragging through the business of the day
Without really knowing anything, I hid a part of me away
At six I must have left, there's no exception to the rule
A matter of routine, I've done it ever since I finished school
The train back home again
Undoubtedly I must have read the evening papers then
Oh yes, I'm sure my life was well within it's usual frame
The day before you came

I must have opened my front door at eight o'clock or so
And stopped along the way to buy some Chinese food to go
I'm sure I had my dinner watching something on TV
There's not a single episode of House of Cards that I have failed to see
I must have gone to bed around a quarter after ten
I need a lot of sleep, and so I like to be in bed by then
I must have read a while
The latest one by Margaret Atwood book or something in that style
It's funny, but I had no sense of living without aim
The day before you came

And turning out the light
I must have yawned and settled up for yet another night
And rattling on the roof I must have heard the sound of rain

Mescaleros,"Well I'll tell you one thing that I know
You don't face your demons down 
You gotta grapple 'em Jack and pin 'em to the ground
The devil may care, maybe god he won't
You better make sure you check on the do's and the don'ts

To show you can glimpse from the mountian top

Then one day I could tell my tracks
About the holes in the soles of my shoes
And that's the day I said I'm gonna make the news

And fallen back in the garden
The days so long ago
Somewhere in the memory 
The sun shines on you boy

And playing in the Arroyo's
Where the American rivers flow
From the Appalachians 
Down to the Delta Roads

A man can think so long 
His brain could well explode
The strings runnin' through the junctions 
A king comes down the road

And if you put it all together
You won't have to look around
You know you cast a long shadow on the ground

Listen to the country
The night jar and the bell
Listen to the night stream lineup 
Soundin' like the wolves of hell

Head for the water
The waters of the cleansing spell
It was always our destination
On the express of the never do wells

And we rocked through Madison's city
And we didn't even know she was there
And when we hit the bumpers in Memphis
Beale street didn't have no prayer

And I hear punks talk of anarchy
I hear hobo's on the railroads
I hear mutterings on the chain gangs
It was those men who built the roads

And if you put it all together 
You didn't even once relent
You cast a long shadow
And that is your testament

There's always rock and roll

MALEVOLENT REVELATION please let me stay,
GIVE ME MORE

LEFT OUT, Dragged down into emptyness
Drowning in floods of misunderstanding
WHY do you all look aside,
You're ripping my dignity AWAY
Inside identity is leaking out
REALIZATION is catching up on me
My needs bashes false immortality
into my affected being...chaos

Cravings of delight
slowly eats my soul
Trapped within myself
Defraying my own lies
Bewalling my demise
Deep penury...internally

I feel marred by errors, can't you see
my desires are calling for me
The sovereign of abnegations,

swings his feelers for a new relation
Come, mesmerize my oppressive mind
Tear apart these vehement cravings
Give me something to live for, bring me back
from my purgatory of obsessions

An unquestionable picture, determined, complete
Its crystalline lines untouched by doubt

In a crimson filtered twilight

The gullibles to bless your sins away
Rags to wipe your blooded trails

To the twining of self-thought knowledge

Unhurried in its deadly intent
The undoer of all, dense and inert

Its design perfected through aeon's
Pure, immaculate, clean, omnicidal god machine

Calm, precise ambition
Untroubled by the roar of unending screams

Forming a discreet quiet whispers
To lead us play deep

And I was ?
My face was hiding from your eyes
Standing shiny side by side
Staring at a false tale, looking at the stars
And I was ?
My face was hiding from your face
Standing shiny side by side
Staring at a false tale, looking at the stars

Don't think I missed her
It's just the resistance
And my mind's been bidding for years
To protect my heart
Don't be mystical
You know my art's been broken
But when you talk to me
I'm coming your word, it's obvious
Please open your eyes
I can be as cold as signs
But the strength of your charm
Suddenly make me shine

Don't think I'm distant
It's just the resistance
And my mind's been bidding for years
To protect my heart

Don't think I'm distant
It's just the resistance
And my mind's been bidding for years
To protect my heart

Don't think I'm distant
It's just the resistance
And my mind's been bidding for years
To protect my heart",The Symphony,2013
Message,"Blue moon you saw me standing alone
Without a dream in my heart
Without a love of my own
Blue moon, you knew just what I was there for
You heard me saying a prayer for 
Someone I really could care for
And then there suddenly appeared before me
The only one my arms will ever hold
I heard somebody whisper ""Please adore me""
And when I looked, the moon had turned to gold!
Blue moon!

Messiah,"Do you need beer to have fun
Don't you know that drugs do con?
Fellowship we need to unit us all,
No use to kick each others balls
Mosh a peaceful way,
Violent brutal thrashers don't need to stay.
Enjoy yourself, non-violent moshing instead of fighting,
Enjoy yourself

We don't care if black or white
All together for a pacifistic fight
We fight for freedom and liberty,
But against destruction and brutality
Hatred racism and arms race,
Vivisection, fur coats are humanitys disgrace.

Enjoy yourself, non-violent moshing instead of fighting,
Enjoy yourself",Enjoy Yourself,
Messiah,"For fifty-two years
We have been married
We've had a lucky life
But now the problems have begun

She's really changed, I can't understand my wife
What's happened with her mind
She keeps forgetting things
I realize the degeneration of her memory
Her lack of independence
Distractedness, personality decline
Obstructions of recollections

The years pass slowly
A lot has changed in my life
She's living with a persecution complex
My wife's a total physical wreck

She's regressing more and more
Her behaviour is like infancy
I see only a grown-up foetus

Nobody will help her
I know she will die
By the alzheimer's disease",Alzheimer's Disease,1994
Messiah,"I see the crusade of mentally disturbed persons
All kinds of mutilated and distraught human beings
Drag alone to the shrouded legend realm

They are suspended high over the burning earth
And leave their earthly existence for their new life

You were redeemed of your worldly torments
Torments of isolation, injustice, lies
Maltreatment, abandonment, mutilation and genocide

Choirs of redemption resound through the sky
Tombones complete the ascent of the deformed creatures

The way is far
Their bodies soar

Angels appear and escort them to their new life
Feelings of pleasure, releif and blissfulness

With their white vestment they look so innocent
They embody the pure joie de vivre
Which they had missed in their past life

The cherubs lead the crusade to the dark tunnel
At the end of the tube, there is a bright light

This will be the end of their long trip
To the unknown fourth dimension
Nobody knows what's behind the light
And what they will do there

They are suspended so easily together with the angels
I'm losing sight of the ones right at the front

They suffered
Since the beginning
Now they've left the
Earthly existence

The ascent brings
Eternal bliss
To everyone
On the crusade

You're still asking yourself, will it be better, the new life?
Will you get the chance to live a normal life?
Were you living a bad life as a person, in your life before?
Your biggest dream was to see god, when you arrived at the gates of heaven
Can you see him?",Ascension of a Divine Ordinance,1994
Messiah,"Murder and manslaughter ruled my life
Eliminated my enemies and killed my wife
Nothing to lose, I'm condemned to death
Enjoy the prison, till my last breath

Either you kill or you will be killed, this was my sacred system
No possibility to live with these rules, I followed my wisdom
I have no regrets about my evil deeds, this was the way to exist
Wriggle my neck out of the noose could make an artist

My fate is decided life or death
I whil away the time with games of chess
I wished for a better end not to wait for my execution
My name will be deleted this will be my termination

It's gruesome to wait for the unknown, I don't know my fate
Killing time and wait for mercy, that's what I hate
Living in fear and trepidation there's hope yet
I'm in fear of god, he has decided about my punishment

Many years passed all of these were past
Nothing has changed, every evening could be last
Apathy becomes apparent, I feel so brainless
I know for certain, I will die a natural death",Condemned Cell,1994
Messiah,"For two weeks, I was sitting in the prison cell
Iron gates obstruct the way to be free
Now, I've enough time to think about my offence
This deed was dreadful and I deeply regret it

I don't like to talk about the things that happened
My mind has drifted to this transgression

The pictures of the offence reflect in my brain
Only now I'm realizing what I have done
Horrible nightmares constantly cross my sleep
At the time it's really hard to live in the cell

Tears run over my cheeks
I've never noticed that before
This is a serious situation
Never could I imagine
I killed an innocent girl
She had the right to live
So I have it too
I know that's my crime
Although the people
Are not blameless

I have the chances ruined for my future
It will be hard to find a new job
My name is murder, it says too much
Everybody will get out of my way

Lost the power, destroyed my pride
My life is ruined, lose my future

My mother left me to my fate
She will have nothing more to do with me
I don't know what the time will bring
When I leave the prison in one year",Contrition,1994
Messiah,"Humans born healthy
We converse all the time
Humans born deformed
We avoid all of them

Your body's crippled, your face deformed
Your hand's mutilated, your skin's burnt
My body's well-shaped, my face is striking
My hand's delicate, my skin's very neat

I can't see in your eyes
Why don't you look at me?
You don't belong in our society
You belong in a closed sanatorium

I'm shocked by your body
You're angry at our refusal
I'm horrified by your face
You're infurious at our inequity

All dreadful beings are creations of god
God has decided you'll live as a clod

God has decided, ill or healthy
He forgot justice
Was this the life you wished for
Spending your life in a closed sanatorium",Deformed Creatures,1994
Messiah,"God created a world, a world of injustice, a world of distrust
He created humans, humans of prejudice, humans with selfishness
He forgot the justice, justice of humanity, justice of equality
You created our faults, pain in our bodies, weakness of our brains

[Chorus:]
For those who will fail
Ora, uxorem, natura

We talk about humans, they couldn't live a real life
Expelled from their families in a remote closed sanitarium
They remain will they'll die
We still shun all these human beings, are we too sensitive?
Why haven't they a place in our society, who takes the blame?
We are all responsible and it's a sacrifice of our limited system
Our system forbids us to see in their eyes and to talk to them

[Chorus]
If they are too weak for society, they will be isolated
The other ones get their revenge

Why can we not be happy to work with them, is this impossible?
When we meet these humand, we're afraid and they give us the creeps
But later we're happy and laugh at these innocent creatures
If we would open our minds, they could be our best friends

[Chorus]",For Those Who Will Fail,1994
Messiah,"The time has come to tell you about my deed
No way to understand how long my heart has bled
I see my life in pictures torments and pleasures
Survived through many conflicts my life gives me no pleasures

My life will not be over, although I'm cast down
It will begin now, the other way around
I let self-drift from my sexual feelings
They are too important for human beings",Lines of Thought of a Convicted Man,1994
Messiah,"I look in the mirror, I see another face
Waiting for my end will be my painful race
My appearance has altered since I consulted my surgeon
He told me about my illness, will survive one season

Drinking is what I need to forget my daily sorrow
Sadness is forgotten, will feel better tomorrow
Living with a confidence will not be better
My body is going weaker, my walking is a stagger

Jesus, I beg of thee, redeem my endless pain
Forgive my sin and save my life, that's only what I need
I prayed to you, every night, is this your thank to me?

I know you made this illness and drove me insane
It's my intention to fight this battle against you
Truth and denomination destroyed my life
There exists only hate and rage in my head

Pictures of my childhood cross my brain all the time
Happiness was easy, there weren't evil minds
Sadness was a foreign word, I never felt better
I played with my friends, day in, day out

I've got a lot of thoughts about my future
My body's a piece of misery, I'm crippled like a creature
Perishing in my bed and watching children play
Shall I wait for my end, will this be the right way
My torment is getting stronger, suicide is my solution
Nobody will cry for me, they will treat me like a felon
Everybody has forsaken me, delivery is my knife
Will suicide be the way to search for a new life",Living With a Confidence,1994
Messiah,"Father and mother divorced as I began the school in hamilton
We had the same problem every night with daddy's addiction
Violence and drunkeness reigned his every day and made us down
I felt really distraught as he finally left our home

The time after was difficult, I felt rather unnerved
Because of my ugly appearance, they treated me like a fool
A misfit, I was derided by the girls of our school
I reached the height of my mental quandary
More and more I shied away and went my lonely way

The time of retaliation will come
Fear, pain, torment
They will come
Admiration, worship
They will treat me like a god

To talk with my schoolmates about girls was an abomination
Possessing a girl was my biggest sexual imagination
I had realized that this idea could never be reality
Dazzled through my sexual lust I planned many different strategies

I possessed no bad conscience only one aim in my eyes
The act of cruelty considered the last details in my mind
A long time to wait for the sunset and the sacrifice made me blind
She was my number one girl, young with her long fair hair
I struck her and dragged her body to the thicket where I raped her

At this moment you were my girl and my dream was reality
She saw my face, there was no other choice but to kill her
Only now I had understood what I had done
I left the scene of the crime quickly and went home

I can't live with the thoughts that I killed a young girl
This was my past but I'm not proud about now
Although I killed a girl, they couldn't give me a life sentence
After one year in the youth custody unit I will be free
Fortunately we all live in a cracked system where you can kill",Raped Bodies,1994
Messiah Bolical,"On my way from the studio driving on my way home
Happy 'cause I'm gonna see my girl tonight
Something messing with my radio 
Gotta be my cell phone ringing

I picked it up it was my girlfriend
But she wouldn't talk to me no
I heard some bitching in the background saying
That my girl was too good for me yeah
And I was like what? Why you chatting my name (oh)
Say it again, nothing to hide got nothing to gain
People wan front just because of my fame
You better stop! Before I lose control

She just want to be there while Craig stays rich
She wouldn't be with him if he was paid basic and
She wouldn't be there if he wasn't made famous

Wanted me to get her a mansion with a truck in the back
Flood her with ice 'til a nigga like honey relax

Talking about all of the women I supposedly boned

You give them an inch & they be taking the p**s
You fed up of it get rid of the witch, don't be taking her s***t
She wasn't saying this when he was licking her lower lip
Making her throw a fit, put you fingers all over it
Tripping all over you whenever you rock the show

He gotta be in too much 'bout everything that he touch
Out of the roof money get packed up and moved in the truck
Kill me if you feel I ain't worthy
I inherited skills from murky niggaz that's as real as my Saints jersey
I stand here posted in the worst of times
Knowing niggaz after me, gonna rehearse my grind
I'm not a prophet, but I could teach you how to cock it and pop it
And how to put some money in your pocket
You see something you like go 'head and cop it
But watch it, niggaz gone knock it
Trying to get you for your paper when them bitches is jockin'
You might do lil' daddy like that, but this is not him
Don't look for your people to help you, my niggaz done shot them
My people done told me I could roll
I got a reputation for beating niggaz and hoes
Stickin' to the G code, 'tees, 'rees, and 'bows

You couldn't step on my toes if you was standing 6' 8""
It's mister 400 bitches so get that shit straight
You better talk to your hoe 'fore I put dick in her face
Look, I'm wild Magnolia, she better get in her place
I ain't a law abiding citizen, I gets ignorant
I got a trail of niggaz telling cops what I did to them
I ain't lookin for no poppers, ain't looking for no partners
I'm looking for mo' choppers to get rid of mo' problems
All I got is my ball and my words
My momma, my daddy, my chil'ren, my gun, and my herb
Shit, they got a lot of killers I know
But ain't too many gon' make it to see 2004, whoa!

I tried to play the backround as mcuh as I could

We scam on shit because we love that sound
We not concerned about waiting unitl the night come 'round
Hey lil' mama I'm a gorilla, let me pipe that down
(puffing sound) yeah, you like that now
I'm a professional, the mountaineer of the streets
I got old timers paying close attention to me
I could get your shit split for the minimum fee (yeah)
Fucking with them niggaz, got a ten for a ki'
Got a few princess cuts on the watch and the piece

I used to press my Dickies with Stay Flo
Sold pieces for my reli, chasing peso
Now they want me with nothing cause I let my pay show
So I hop inside of my Mercedes and let the bass go
On you hating ass niggas
I deserve everything I get, A creating cash getter
I ain't putting the 2 on the 10
I'm making vast figures
You fags bitter, mad
Wanna be faking class with us
How they thinking they gonna come and conquer us?
Little Mini Cooper hating on a monster truck
Ponder such, I'll have you up in yonder, stuck
Not a nare nutta brother stutter that conjure a,
Nothing, nothing, The Ruger's penetration
Inside of ya head is what's sounding like it's bassing
Boom, Bing, Bang
All you haters in the game, Strange lane taking aim
Ain't a damn thing sane, I get it in
Want some drama? Well I can fit it in
We can make it so you're no longer a citizen
Suction from beneath you
We just a little dust'n
All because I'm bringing the bucks in

I used to cop and used to chop
And dump my rocks at Ms. Scott's
And on the late night at Ms. White's
I'm fucking with Will, We used to play fight
Then one night, We came up with Vill
Young thugs dump drugs
Nigga hungry for meals
Young thugs jumped blood
Nigga itching for kills
Shit was real in the field, man
This shit was too real
Lost my homies to this shit, man
This shit is for real
But nigga, Nowadays the streets
They go hard on the hustler
All these pussy niggas lacking
So us real niggaz suffer
Not plentiful for me no more
It's hoes in the game
Since I smell when paper folding, man
I rolling with Strange
Pour some whiskey, Party with me
Tell the Feds if they miss me
They ain't coming for me now

Talk with bananas and talk clips
Ride around and smoke kush with the yurner on me
Drink them champagne bottles with the flower on 'em
All that talking loud will get a nigga a hit
You see them cherry red chucks?
Yeah, I'm with the shit
Anyway I bounce out, man
I hit 'em up and I'll lock up with you
We could get 'em up
I still wear a gold grill, 10 across the bottom
They call me 19-5 cause a nigga got 'em
Click-Clack, nigga
Yanka get yanked on
There's been a lot of hating, nigga

Is the best world of all

It's bringing me back to the place I don't want to be

Chicago skyline lit the night

Cut my nose, bite my face
Tonight will last forever
Take my life with your hands

I laid with you until the end
Watching the breath crawl from your lungs
My alibi was lost that night
So take your last breath in tonight
Let the frozen sky, surround your eyes

Tonight will last forever

But lies, intoxicated eyes
And lonely hearts
Are held accounted for

Disease eats inside
Nothing left to hide

You're my mistake
And I know it's wrong
Don't let the truth be told
Scared of what you don't know
These secrets, keeping us alive

Break my chest in two
(Break my chest in two)
A shallow heart for you

Half a heart is all you see
Bleeding off dependency
Got nothing left to hide
As his black heart dies

You're my mistake

And I know it's wrong

Don't let the truth be told
Scared of what you don't know

These secrets keeping us alive

I leave my heart to take
With blood shot eyes
Your heart will break

As this night fades again

So broken down I've lost again
I'm lost again

You're my mistake

And I know it's wrong

Die mich kräftig unterstützen und auch mal nen Fehler verzeihn
Die immer hinter mir stehn, bei jeglichen Schlägerein
Du stehst alleine da und kassierst die Schellen ein
Die Sekte ist mein Fleisch und Blut
Wie Feuer und Glut
Wie Ebbe und Flut
Wie Ehre und Mut
Wie Bong und Sut

Wenn es sein muss benutzen wir auch einen spitzen Stift
Drauf geschissen, ob ein Messer am Start ist *Wichser*

Ich reit bei euch ein, und jag euch mit ner Eisenstange

S E K T E steht für Gangsta-Rap und Aggressivität

Ich brech dir auch die Beine und werd dich danach jagen
Was willst du tun, wenn auf einmal der Club brennt?
Deine Ho mit uns abzeckt?
Und mit jedem pennt
Was willst du tun, wenn ich hinter dir steh?
Dir in den Rücken springe und dann den Hals umdreh
Was willst du tun, wenn wir beide blicke ficken?
Ich komm ganz cool auf dich zu und lass mein Stick klicken

Deine kack fresse tut mich schon länger stressen

Schon vergessen?

Du kriegst so wie so nen Tritt
In deine Eier und die Sekte feiert mit

Fumse gibt den Stick

Ich brauch mindestens 3 Waffen, bis ich ihn runter krieg

Man kann unseren Style so wie so nicht Kopier'n

Ich hab' mit 23 Jahren alles geseh'n
Für was es sich nicht lohnt zu leben
Ich hatte 1000 Hürden auf meinen Wegen
Doch guck mich an ich hab noch nicht aufgegeben
Ich leb mein Leben
Schon als Kind war es hart (hart)
Ich konnte einfach nicht machen was man mir sagt (sagt)
Ich wollte nicht hören
Alles klang nach Stumpfsinn
Ich wollte den ganzen Tag sein, wo die Jungs sind
Action machen war cooler als die Schule
Ich wollte aufdrehen
Weil die Weiber drauf stehen
Hauptsache ficken
Geld machen mit ticken
Mama wollte mich aufs Gymnasium schicken
Stattdessen durfte sie mich bei den Bullen abholen
Dabei war sie schon gestresst wegen den kack Kohlen
Heute tut's mir leid
Doch ich kann die zeit
Nicht zurück drehen

Geb ich auf die Schule keinen Fick
Auf keine Hure einen Fick
Auf die Zukunft keinen Fick
Guckst du dich mal um merkst du das macht heute jeder
Doch viele wissen nicht warum ihr Kühlschrank
Wird nie leerer
Haben immer was zuessen
Dafür Eltern die immer stressen
Mich haben sie nie gestresst
Aber dafür ganz vergessen
Hab ich mal action geh ich mit Gewalt vor
So bin ich aufgewachsen
Meine Straßen sind Hardcore
Sie dich vor Gangster zu sein ist nix leichtes
In ne Gang zu kommen und cool zu tun das reicht nicht
Ich bin ein Killa
Ick, Bildung? Nein, das weiß ich
Frag die Jungs aus Neukölln 44 36

Mädchen fickt man hier im Hausflur

Es geht ums überleben
Jede nacht muss ich nachdenken
Und überlegen
Wie kann ich im leben was schaffen oder bewegen
Wo die leute noch in hundert jahren
Drüber reden
So wie Che Gevara, Gingis Kahn oder Bin Laden
Sie hatten alle eins gleich sie waren geladen
Ich bin eh schon tot
Fang an mein grab zu graben
Egal was passiert ich steh für sekte raps und balladen

Sind damit auch gut gefahren

Wondering if it's real or am I going insane
Running fast to lock the doors, a banshee now awaits
Seconds count, I warn my friends, or is it now too late?

[Verse 1]
You could strike a match in my hand
Too black to tan, heavy-metal rhythm from a one man band
Bust my knuckles in a junkyard scuffle
Whippin' adversaries with a brass belt buckle
Born in the ghetto, hard like metal
Got a '87 'vette with a fat gas petal
Live a hard life, shave with a knife
Love to get freaky on the gloomiest nights

[Chorus]
I got childhood scars in the streets of my life
Girls laughed, now they beggin' to be Mix-A-Lot's wife
The new breed is here, vigilante's of rap
Got eyes like fire, with my boys at my back
Now I'm back for revenge, all the rumors must end
Freaky breathin' is out, bold music is in
I lot of dummies gettin' money, just by clappin' their hands
Not the style or desire of a true Iron Man

(You know what I want to hear)

[Verse 2]
A southside broola don't drink coolers
Big money maker, not a dumb drug user
It's real not drama, hate pet llamas
Met Clint Eastwood, slapped his momma
Billboard thriller, Avenue chiller
Hard rock lover, and soft rock killer
Girls in the house, watch your blouse
I'm the man your momma was warnin' you about
The bad boy of rap, givin' no slack
Talk behind my back, and you might get slapped
You might get paid, but your metal ain't real
Your rock's like mush, this rock's like steel

Makin' you mad and I'm elated
Beats sickapater, your bad I'm greater

You're much to cruel to have a point of view

No one to turn to, oh, how dare you
How does a child get himself out of harm's way?
A price no one should pay

Can't you see the tears they're crying
Don't you care your kids are dying?
From the senseless torment that you put them through

There's different kinds of lies to tell
Abuse is from the pit of hell
A demon with a goal that is to kill

You better hear the words I say
Deliverance may be far away

Metal Mike Chlasciak,"From memories of 68 when the wizard shook the world
Metal came from foundries where the midlands sound unfurled
The bullring was a lonely place of concrete towers and steel
The coal mines and the industries were all I had to fell.

Something inside took hold of me, I really didn't know
But overtime it came to be, I knew which way to go
I drove around in search of what would make this all come true
From jazz and electricity and good old southern blues

Hell, we're born to raise some hell
Hell, we're gonna raise some hell

In Henry's and in mother's where I'd go to bang my head
The feeling took a hold of me with every word I said
The voice was born and came alive from all I saw and heard
And now I knew my destiny, I had to spread the word.

I took the scream around the world
From London to L.A.
Unleashed in downtown Tokyo
Blew Godzilla away

Then on the sound and fury went from Sydney to Brazil
It sent the Russians crazy cause they never get their fill.

Of Hell, we're born to raise some hell
Hell, we're gonna raise some hell
Hell, we're born to raise some hell
Hell, we're gonna raise some hell

The stage and the lights and the amps are ablaze watch them burn
From all this insanity the Metal God's will return.

Shock waves attack relentlessly, intimidating force
So many bands surrounding you with evil from our source
It screams across the universe and slams you to the floor
This blitzkrieg psycho mania is coming on full roar

And we're all on the road to hell and that's route 666

Frank Zappa and the Mothers
Were at the best place around
But some stupid with a flare gun
Burned the place to the ground
Smoke on the water, fire in the sky

They burned down the gambling house
It died with an awful sound
Funky Claude was running in and out
Pulling kids out the ground
When it all was over
We had to find another place

But Swiss time was running out
It seemed that we would lose the race

It was empty cold and bare
But with the Rolling truck Stones thing just outside
Making our music there
With a few red lights and a few old beds
We make a place to sweat

'Cause I'm a rockstar, baby
Born in the U.S.A
I'm gonna hit the highway on my Harley, do about 38

Nothin' else but take it easy
Any woman that won't please me, I'll give her up
Anythin' that won't touch or move me, I'll give it up
And I know you're all serious
We did it, did it again

More than this, nevermore you whippin' boy
Yeah, we did it
More than this, nevermore you whippin' boy
Yeah, we did it, let's go

Just when you thought it was over
Just when you thought we were done
Just when you thought it was safe now
We did it, did it again

Just when you thought it was over
Just when you thought we were done
Just when you thought it was safe now
We did it, did it again

Who loves a little rock and roll
Mixed with a little bit of hip hop soul? We do
Come one on a rock steady, keep you rockin'
Get ready and say we did it, we did it again

Believe in the air you breathin'
I'm a mad work freak with a freaky weekend
No matter what you spend 'cause your just livin' it up
And damn, if we don't do it again

Come on in, baby bring some friends
We havin' a party, tonight
I'm bringing juice and gin, you'll beat your head
Swiss we did it, did it again

More than this, nevermore you whippin' boy
Yeah, we did it
More than this, nevermore you whippin' boy
Yeah we did it, let's go

Just when you thought it was over
Just when you thought we were done
Rip that smile right off your face

Just when you thought it was over
Just when you thought we were done
Rip that smile right off your face

Fast cars, fast brauds
I'm a rockstar, baby
Born in the U.S.A

Who loves a little rock and roll
Mixed with a little bit of hip hop soul
We do, we do
Now break it down, break it down

More than this, nevermore you whippin' boy
Yeah, we did it
More than this, nevermore you whippin' boy
Yeah, we did it, let's go

Just when you thought it was over
Just when you thought we were done

I want you as a wife

Frustration is my lexicon of hate
Frustration is my lexicon of hate
Fru fru frustration, my lexicon of hate

I cry icicles
Heartbeats flutter
Abnormal rhythm
I wish that I could kill you
But I too love your eyes
I want you as my wife
I want you as my wife
Spermless like a girl

Lucky in feeling
More man than I
Marry me, marry me, marry me
I want you as a wife
Spermless like a girl
Puking my guts at your feet
More man than I

Metallica,"Would you come to me
If I was half drowning
An arm above the last wave

Would you come to me
Would you pull me up
Would the effort really hurt you
Is it unfair to ask you
To help pull me up

The window broke the silence of the matches
The smoke effortlessly floating

Pull me up
Would you be my lord and savior
Pull me up by my hair
Now would you kiss me, on my lips

Burning fever burning on my forehead
The brain that once was listening now
Shoots out its tiresome message

Won't you pull me up
Scalding, my dead father
Has the motor and he's driving towards
An island of lost souls

Sunny, a monkey then to monkey
I will teach you meanness, fear and blindness
No social redeeming kindness
Or oh, state of grace

Would you pull me up
Would you drop the mental bullet
Would you pull me by the arm up
Would you still kiss my lips
Hiccup, the dream is over
Get the coffee, turn the lights on
Say hello to junior dad
The greatest disappointment
Age withered him and changed him
Into junior dad

Moaning at the bed side
Moaning from each limb

Little dog who can't get in
Can only cry but
Can not swim

Pony legs, little trot
Little dog has to wait a lot

The bigger dog has got his spot
And elbowed him away

Listen to him barking
Listen to him call
Little dog don't have much at all

A puny body and a tiny dick
A little dog can make you sick

If you got the money you can go to the top
The female dog don't care what you got
As long as you can raise that
Little doggie face to a cold hearted pussy
You could have a taste

A taste of what the big dog got
A taste of what the big dog got
The little dog with the one hundred dollar spot
Can run his tongue over the hot in trot
Hot in trot

Counts his fingers and his toes
He still got those

Metallica,"I would cut my legs and tits off
When I think of Boris Karloff and Kinski
In the dark of the moon
It made me dream of Nosferatu
Trapped on the isle of Doctor Moreau
Oh wouldn't it be lovely

Small town girl
Small town girl

I was thinking Peter Lorre
When things got pretty gory as I
Crossed to the Brandenburg Gate
I was feeling snappy perhaps I'd been napping
As I just ate
A following heart can tear you apart
On a midnight to eight shift
A graveyard romance can only give one chance
As the tombstones weave and breathe

Small town girl
Small town girl

Feeling happy when my heart got beating
On a Sunday afternoon
I dreamt of breezes going through the treeses
And stars were still illumed
I have three hearts that I keep apart
Trying to relate
To normal feelings and the nighttime reeling
And some absinthe drunk so late

Small town girl
My small town girl

The cook got drunk and all the whores they shrunk
Onto the size of dessert plates
But me I'm happy cause I got my little nappy
And some opium to set me straight
I'm just a small town girl who wants to give it a whirl
While my looks still hold me straight

Straight up to illusion and fantasy's fusion
Of reality mixed with drink
I'm just a small town girl who's gonna give life a whirl
Looking at the Brandenburg Gate

Small town giving it a whirl
