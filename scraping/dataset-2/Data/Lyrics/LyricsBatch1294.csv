Yuki Kajiura,"Enter the scenery of love
Lovers are in pain
They blame and pick on each other
You play melodies of love
Forgotten phrases
Tender and sweet

Come a little bit closer
Don't stay in the shadows my boy
(La la la la la la la)
The melody's fading.....
Now or never, love will go

I'll be there by your side
Share your fears in the silent redemption
Touch my lips, hold me tight
Live in vanity for a while

As winter melts in the sun
Boys will be out running and reaching for the light
Oh mother please find me in that place
Before the memories tear us into pieces

Clinging to affection, we somehow do learn to live
(La la la la la la la)
In endless motion
Never coming back, love will go

You'll be there by my side
You may never know my devotion
Feel my breath in the quiet night
Live in vanity for ever

Won't you feel my gentle emotion
Let us live in peace with conviction
If you're here please hold me",Vanity,2003
Yuki Kajiura,"We're in the middle of the winter
And walking hand in hand
Long lime no see, but now you're here with me
To bless this icy land

If the night is dark and cold
I will warm you with my kiss
Let me hold you in my arms again
And vow to stay with me
Through the snow

I was always sad and cold
All alone, before we met
Now you've taught me how to find the light
Even in darkness of winter

We are wandering hand in hand
Up and over hills of snow
We'll keep on walking through winter",Winter,2003
Yuki Masuyama,"啊！啊！過去我平均每天極@個錯 (woo)
身邊不缺人陪 卻還是寂寞 (ha)
心裡好多計劃 很偉大 卻也常懶惰
常常椰酗ㄢQ人瞭解的念頭
電影很浪漫而我卻(沒感覺)
別人玩得開心而我偏(想離開)
也不是說 每一天 都那勻纗L
只不過 沒重點 平淡的生活 (而你)出現 空氣也變得新鮮
看見你 對我笑 突然發現 sunshine
背景變模糊 鏡頭繞一圈我確定這次一定是經典
不必多金 沉默是金 要的不是那個
你好用心 美麗的心 讓我睜開重新看自己的眼睛
都因為你 my Love

I know you rise in the morning sun
I feel you touching in the pouring rain
And the moment that you wander far from me
I wanna feel you in my arms again
How deep is your love

不管別人怎六 月亮永遠在地球旁邊
就像我永遠在 你的身邊
我伸手就能感覺 你的指尖
沒有懷疑 就在我們中間 想換個名子 when you call me DEAR
世界沒有暴力 當愛人在一起
不要長大 像現在這樣無憂無慮
輕輕鬆鬆過一天 叫人羨慕(忌妒)
不管以後再遇到 多少美眉
我都毽禨 呃~ 妹妹(汪！汪！)
好啦 算啦 這樣吧 不要生氣 跟你開玩笑的啦
我不 在為誰心動
從來沒有過 這深刻感動
因為你給我沒有條件的包容 我決心要捍衛它

And you come to me on a summer breeze
Keep me warm in your love then you softly leave
And it's me you need to show
How deep is your love
How deep is your love How deep is your love
I really need to learn
'Cause we're living in a world of fools
Breaking us down
When they all should let us be
We belong to you and me
La la la

Uh, you hold the key it's from my heart
Uh, Yo! And we could never be apart
Woo, ride, ride deep and dive
Take it to your places, I'm by your side
Uh, two hearts for a deep inside
Uh, from star let me make you cry
'Cause you got me open wild

And you may not think that I care for you
When you know down inside that I really do
And it's me you need to show
How deep is your love
How deep is your love How deep is your love
I really need to learn
'Cause we're living in a world of fools
Breaking us down
When they all should let us be
We belong to you and me
I believe in you",How Deep Is Your Love?,2001
Yukihiro Takahashi,"It's all too much, It's all too much

When I look into your eyes, your love is there for me
And the more I go inside, the more there is to see

It's all too much for me to take
The love that's shining all around you
Everywhere, it's what you make
For us to take, it's all too much

Floating down the stream of time, of life to life with me
Makes no difference where you are or where you'd like to be

It's all too much for me to take
The love that's shining all around here
All the world's a birthday cake,
So take a piece but not too much

Set me on a silver sun, for I know that I'm free
Show me that I'm everywhere, and get me home for tea

It's all to much for me to see
A love that's shining all around here
The more I am, the less I know
And what I do is all too much

It's all too much for me to take
The love that's shining all around you
Everywhere, it's what you make
For us to take, it's all too much

It's too much...It's too much

Too much too much too much (fade to end)",It's All Too Much,1982

And maybe all our truths will be lies someday

Don't run away now
You've got nothing to lose

Baby, I feel so alone
And I need someone
To call my own

'Cause my love just left me
And I need someone new
Who can tell me forever
In my eyes I own you

Baby, oh baby, oh baby
Come to me

Baby, I've been waiting on you
Don't run away now
You've got nothing to lose

Yukimi Nagano,"Strange love, even though you hurt me I feel blessed love
Baby I'm your puppet on a string
Making me tumble and swing
Trouble's what you bring
Strange love, strange love

Strange how, you control my every little move now
Hanging from your strings is all I know
Starring in your puppet show
Never let me go, strange love

All the things you've said and done
There's no space for me to run
Baby I've lost and you have won
'Cause' all I really want is

Strange love, even though you hurt me I feel blessed love

",Whenever There Is You,2006
Yukimi Nagano,"Oh joy's arise
The sun has come again to hold you
Sailing out the doldrums of the whole week
The polyphonic prairies here, it's all around you
It's all around you, out here

And if the whole world is crashing down
Fall through space out of mind again
Where the emptiness we leave behind on warm air rising
Blows all the shadows far away

The falling alcohol empire, is here to hold you
Rolling out and haunted 'til it sleeps

Little memories, marching on
Your little feet, working the machine
Will it spin, will it soar
My little dream, working the machine

Soon like a wave that pass will fall
And closing in on you they're going on

Little memories

Yukimi Nagano,"Waiting by the mailbox, by the train
Passin' by the hills 'til I hear the name
I'm looking for a saw to cut these chains in half and all I want is
Someone to rely on as
Thunder comes a rolling down
Someone to rely on as
Lightning comes a staring in again

I'll wait to be forgiven
Maybe I never will
My star has left me
To take the bitter pill
That shattered feeling
Well the cause of it's a lesson learned
Just don't know if I could roll into the sea again
Just don't know if I could do it all again she said, it's true

Waiting in my room and I lock the door
I watch the colored animals across the floor
And I'm looking from a distance
And I'm listening to the whispers
And oh it ain't the same, when your falling out of feeling and your
Falling in and caught again (caught again)

I'm caught again in the mystery
You're by my side, but are you still with me?
The answer's somewhere deep in it, I'm sorry but your feeling it
But I just have to tell you that I love you so much these days
Have to tell you that I love you so much these days, it's true

My heart is in economy
Due to this autonomy
Rolling in and caught again
Caught again
Caught again

Rolling in and caught again

Yukimi Nagano,"I could bet all the riches that I ever had

You are my star
Nothing else can lead me off track

Hey, yeah

Yukio Yung,"Did you see your friend crying from his eyes today
Did you see him run through the streets and far away
Did you see him run, did you see him fall
Did his life flash by at the bedroom door

Did you hear the news it came across the air today
Someone has been found on the rocks down in the bay
Did you see him hide, did you see him crawl
Does his life mean more than it did before

Did you see that man running through the streets today
Did you catch his face, was it 10538

It's a livin' thing
It's a terrible thing to lose
It's a given thing
What a terrible thing to lose

From your worst day
Moving in line then you look back in time

I got more soul in my style 
Then they will ever know 
I got more rhythm than I'll ever need to show 
We got them groceries bro

Get deep into my hold 
If ya lost, then picture gold 
I heard styles that others stole 
But it's no original flow 
Like the Luniz an the man wit the nose. 

Notice my flows kick like a loaded Mac-11 
Ghetto heavy, could climb wit mo ""Good Times"" than James Devin 
Glock wars 
Meanin you critize Tupac for

Suppressed yes 
Crazy no 
Not insane 
I smoothie through the menu then I make my order 
I got that dominate gene 
So if ya 'noid hide yo daughter 
The love ya givin is based on what I do for you 
For the right amount of money you probably let me ??? you 
I like to glide up in it, but I got my pride 
Ain't no whore 
Don't second guess yo man 'cause he got more. 

Studio gangstas want to battle, well let's battle

They plastic ass get put under ground wit the fragments. 

Snaggle tooth rhymers wit no flavor 
Save a gang a neighbors 
Then move away so they won't be called haters.

Up-up an away ya go

Nigga East Oakland
Where niggas be posted all night long
Hoping they still smoking like Cheech and Chong
To each his own
Never leave home without my heat or chrome
Strapped like a beeper on my hip
Ready to flip when the heat is on
Hop in the Lac with Axl Foley
Presidential Roley make niggas want to hold me for ransom
And some bitches know me
My niggas told me
Them bitches love holding pockets
Get out a pocket
I'll knock your jaw out your socket
Then squash this
Fold up a little S-see
Best be on my see-H-E-S-T
If niggas test me
Let's see
Which nigga gonna meet Elvis Presley
Best be like what up my niggas let up like a Nestles Crunch
And start to punch niggas
Soon they gonna crunch
Fall on the dance floor
Haul off your ass into my hands slow
Get the show cancelled
No Hansel and Gretel in the ghetto just to let you know

Now what makes the motherfucking world go round?
You can sit back relax to my ghetto sound
This is for the hoes, niggas
Money and the yay
It gets mega trifling when your struggling and your striving
Surviving
I'm stuck to the strip for my grip
Penitentiary chances for my cash advances
What's my stances?
Brings this to your hood late night for the trip gold hund's
I want my fetty in tons
Gangs and guns
Five thousand stash what the sum
A nickel slick nigga and I'm up with the sun
So what you got for me cooking in the kitchen
Two birds hella sift got my motherfucking palms itching
So scandalous and my east coast dunns
Shit foaming and bubbling
For my money and the doubling
Respect that the Yak track got me caught up
All this ""D"" and the scrilla ain't never enough
I pop my title like cash I'm in this game for a Franklin
Serious rap shit got a young nigga banking
Street stanking

Plastered to the wall I'm behind the scenes

Started off that Crystal and budded
My neighborhood I love it
I'm never above it
I stays true to it
Better flew in like fluid
I'm knowing how to do it
And partner I've been through it
Sure I'm improving I'm the coldest thing moving
I had some confrontation with some cocky-ass Cuban
He said some black squabbling for some cheddar
And then he had to deepen and dict the vendetta
Well anyway I gave my baby mamma my Buretta
And told her that some Cubans might try to come get her
But meanwhile I'm a try to peel them first
But if they invade let your heater disperse
Cock it back bang, bang and do your thing girl
Let them know what's going down in your world
I want a woman with smarts
I want a woman with heart
That won't hesitate to blow your buster ass apart

A hundred miles an hour top speed you shouldn't of fucked with

And fuck who you with
You should have came with your whole army
Now your duct taped buck naked walking home with no car keys
Yeah you're swoll like Lou Ferigno
But all that shine like glitter it ain't gold

Matching Lamborghini and diamonds

Hitting the corner, hopping up in my Benz with your cash

Nobody run, I come like point blank
Mobbing the motherfucking bank, looking like Benjamin Frank and Itake
So many penitentiary chances, to make
Scrilla scratch niggas must have more stack in the safe
I mean ? nigga your safe is my safe
And I'm gonna make sure that my safe ain't your safe
By putting a .38 up in your face
For running up in my place and shake the spot
And not expect to get your ass shot
Yeah, another one bites the dust, the shyster busts

I hang with these thugs.
Whut?
I'm from the hood,
Nigga.
I gives a fuck. (I gives a fuck.)
It's in my blood.
Since I was little I been hangin' with these niggas.
And till I die I gon' remain with these niggas.
St. Paul in
The M-P-L-S, I hear you callin'.
I put it down, yes.
Now, Chris Rock, where you at?
I heard you say some shit about some blacks,
Nigga, this been your ass back.
Come see the real deal.
Stay in the fields, nigga.
These niggas will kill.
This ain't no cap-gun shots, nigga.
This a glock, pah, pah.
It's death on your block,
Knock, knock.
Whut's up nigga?
These sirens start singing.
It's me and Yuk with the L-G in the makin'.
It's stinkin', freakin',
Bowlin' on the weekend.

And I bring the B-O-M-B,

Smokin, sweets, drink forties to the suds,
And fuckin' wit' these thugs, nigga.
That's in my blood.
You wonder why us niggas be hustlers,
And out there slingin' drugs, nigga?
That's in my blood.
That drug money, stuff that shit up under the rug,
And make that nigga bug, nigga.
It's in my blood.
Niggas like me, turn niggas like you into hustlers.
Fucking with us, fucking wit us!

It's in my veins,
Like a chain-reaction.
How it all happened.
Paps is slangin' crack in the mid eighties,
Back in the day, when shit was crackin'.
Niggas pay thirty-eight for a package.
Tightly rappin',
For shippin' and handelin', taxes was added.
That's where the A-rap's headin'.
Even when I sleep, they in cavage,
Lavage shit.
Do automatics, with scopes, under my mattress,
With the dope and the drugmoney.
Stuffin' that shit up under the rug money.
Thug hungry.
Takin' drugs only 'cause we love money.
I'm a nigga, he's a nigga.
Would you like to be a nigga too?
Makin' big scrilla, like these niggas do.
You probably be a drugdealer too.
Scan and tuned, into the boys in blue.
Listen for clues.
In the kitchen, bakin' up Peruvian flake.
It takes twenty-eight grams,
Multiplied by thirty-six zips to make
A triple beam brake, a triple beam shake.
A hundred grams on the triple beam flake.
Two point two pounds, to be straight.
My niggas just flew in from G-A,
Ready to buy 4 kilos,
Then drive slow back to Youngstown, Ohio.
So fuck these rhymes.
Let me stick my dick in your ear,
And fuck with your mind,
Nigga.

[Chorus]

Niggas portray themselves as low key.
Broken down and fabricated,
Easily ejaculated, table with, and halfway faded.
Ain't no wars, 'cause they made it.
That type of bullshit is outdated.
But I played it like I laid it.
My partners have always said that.
It was set me up 
For life.
Money, clothes and hos, but road I chose was
Nothin' nice.
Niggas know just what it's like to be hustlers.
Governors from strugglers.
Bitches lovin' us.
Blindly chasin' that life we lust.
I blush.
Bottles, havin' thoughts and iring dreams.
Goin' down and roll fast.
Tryin' to get what my eyes have seen.
Fried of me, huh.
Nigga for a hand that got me through these eyes right to see.
But part not I was blind to the point,
Not even I could see, or that I could be,
Obviously.
I wasn't meant for me this type of trickery.
Hit me with the type of mystery.
Lay it down like history.
With the intent of me, myself, and I.
Street desire, easily.
Piece of mind, I was least to find.
Some sassiness.
Hossisiless, it gets to shit and praise to the farmer innercist.
Nobody was meant for it, it was deadly,
And I was discontent
With the shit that life once sent.
Government depend, now most of my time is spent
Escapin' what I love.
It's in my blood.

Listen, I'm bout to lace y'all motherfuckers
about Oakland, the City of Dope
The first place in the world to ever sell base rock
nigga, crack rock, they put it there to get rid
of the Panthers, but they really created this ballin
what, what, nigga

Verse 1:

Me and my niggas trying to ride drop
buy rocks then we buy blocks 
from the same dope fiends on my block who buy rocks 
want supply hot
weight servin cakes like IHOP
ever since them last motherfuckers got shot
police been hot on my spot
spot cops FBI watch
got fiber-optic shit up in the pole
showing my whole clique on crime watch
we let non-stop and show our faces
so what the case is
we wide on TV but still the grind don't stop
nigga this Oakland, the city of dope
You know where that crack shit was invented
and smoked by these ghetto chemists years ago
on Plymouth street we call the block
Plymouth Rock 
the first place like the world to ever sell base rocks
now check it,
the legendary Phoenix Mitchell put it down
so tough they had to make a movie about the town
but called it Nino Brown
That bullshit New Jack City
is really based upon this place we call Crack City
Oakland, Cali we act shitty
think crack's the answer
to get rid of these revolutionary Black Panthers
Smokin' blow and takin (???) like Jo-Jo Dancer
Or sniff it up your nose and ball out of control
like Tony Montana
house in Atlanta
3-car garage
our ghetto superstars was hard
young niggas touch a mil-ticket
before they life behind bars
niggas get caught with like eighty kilos
hidden in the wall
but shit ain't hidden at all
from these cocaine sniffin dogs
same with the law
shit in your draws when they get your ass
and let the ballers ball, get the cash
till they get to your ass
I've never seen a baller fall on his knees
and snitch so fast
plea bargain run after them niggas
that hang out with your ass
no wonder why that bitch-ass nigga got out
so quick, so fast
came on the block my niggas saw you
choppin' it up with task
now that's a violation
nigga can't chop it up with task
so while the trial awaits
some nigga walks up and pumped his ass
Because the niggas in the O are hard as fuck
we sell peruvian flake, get it powdered, or rocked up
don't want nothin from life but to retire from the game
motherfuckin city of cocaine,

city of dope
East Oakland, yeah that's right

them task folks can't stop us
high school niggas get caught with a hundred G's
stashed in his locker along with a chopper

he bought up countless brand new helicopters
and suburbans, now he hurtin
the feds spilled they base downtown
so now its curtains

dope feind came through last week
told me its gonna be a sweep
1991's the number nigga
end of the summer
niggas ain't ridin no fuckin hummers
we ride under buckets and try to stay on the slunder
I wonder, wonder what they would do
to a nigga who get caught with 2 pounds of thunder
straight from Humboldt county, fuck that brown
weed all should be green like the jungle
dope fiends tryin to warn us
settin' up scene still in a bundle
we beat they ass and drag them from they hair
just like repunzel
don't fuck up our hustle
But anyway the day came just as predicted
I'm up at 6 in the mornin' takin early morning pissin'
pulled down my britches, and a nigga almost shitted
I heard somebody walkin on the roof
I cocked the fo-fitness
woke my cousin Mike up
could be some niggas sent to strike us
cause back then so many niggas didn't like us
looked out the window, all I saw 
was FBI and snipers
I let the china white flush
and put that motherfucking 4-5 up
see the dope fiend he informed us
told us its gonna be a sweep and then
he tried to warn us
but niggas out here try to make they money
so we 'nourmous
then only a battering ram
bustin down your shit, 'nourmous
highway patrols, 5.0's, ambulance and coroners
in case there was a shootout or high-speed chase performance
by 9:00 they lock down each baller from every corner
from north to west on down to east Oakland California
but, but, them niggas from the O is hard as fuck
we sell Peruvian flake powder or get it rocked up

Abusing the game

Thugged out and turned out
Set that motherfucking perm out your head
Niggas dead

Kiss the ring

Put a nigga up in a ho
Just like a ground hole

Juvenile as a child but goin to the pen as men
Either Rawkus Isle Four Shone or San Quinn
Where my life end fuck doin time in the pen
I'd rather die fuck time in the pen secret indictment

I'm strikin like lightning in the fast lane
Introduced to the crack game by nigga Jermaine
And get your scratch man
The gats came, the leather gloves and ski masks came
And then the lake on the slaps came
Ain't a damn thang to it
Do fool we just gon do it
Get em for the kilos and embalming fluid
I'm a do it but since I'm new to it
Ask that nigga why you don't do it
He said hey yo that's the nigga I'm cool with
I fool with on the Peruv shit
But dudes sick drunk off two fifths
He showed me where the kilos is hidden at
Exclusive but 'cause I knew shit nobody lose shit
They ruthless but if I do the lick nigga we screw shit
So if you gon do it let me know
You let me know what to do with this shit when I get it
Meet me at Texaco and then we'll flee get away fly to Mexico
Cancun the lampoon with the fileco
Illegal drug life we'll live the thug life
Ever since a kid when my father used to sniff the white
In front of me look what you've done to me
Your son is gonna be a thug
Until they put one in me or I'm a see my blood
I need to bust fuckin with the niggas rein up
Soon as we get this lick niggas gon be seein us
Hop in the GM truck then pull up to the spot
Not knowin it's bein watched by cops
Still I creep up the stairs with the glock hot
Kicked down the door
Where the nigga hides the money at I hit his bedroom drawers
For sho money galore nigga I scored
Snatch a lotta gs put it in my socks and the wallabys
Got the kis out the basement left his his shit vacant
But the cops had a nigga on surveillance
They let me take shit they didn't raid shit
But finally watch a nigga make that illegal exchanges

Listen yeah nigga I told yo motherfuckin ass this was a sweet
Ass lick throw that shit in motherfuckin trunk fool
Lets ride to this motherfuckin telly and get up with these hoes

(Chorus x2)

That was an easy lick put the kicks in his whip
Then we hit the hotel six to split the chips
Police will get this shit crunk
Called the nigga that we robbed told em we'd rob em now its big funk
And niggas like him be waitin for shit to jump with the pump
Get your ump throw the bitch in the trunk with the bump
Then the police told him where we stay
Think we got a smooth getaway parlay
Drinkin Alize and Crysti with these bad bitches drippin on the floor
Til some nigga kicked down the door
And screamed any last wishes in a ski mask trippin and mack grippin
All we had was two gats hidden 
One in the bathroom one in the kitchen the ho that was trippin
Started cryin he slapped her ass and said stop bicthin 
Now y'all listen give me all the chickens
Before a nigga could mention anything he shot my nigga in the back
Called him a rat and slapped him with a gat
He blew the bitches wig back clack clack
Unload put a new clip back clack clack
Aimed the gat at me asked me where the crack at
You know we had to stash that said it's in the kitchen in a knap sack
Hey let me show you don't do no funny moves or I'll blow you
I know you it's over here he seen the Peru
I grabbed the tech twenty-two out the drawer cocked it back and blew
His fuckin brains on the wall grabbed the caine fuck the broads
Tried to leave out the hotel room and seen the laws pull up
'Freeze put your hands up or we're comin in with tear gas'
Shit I ran back in the hotel room stashed the cash
And the slapsticks and you know through the glass came the gas
Bombs and motherfuckers sprayed likeSadam Hussein 
It came to this bitch cops is dangerous
Chokin could barely breath no air police everywhere
So I crawled in the bathroom hide in there
Plus I got a five in there
'Come out or we're comin in' 
Put his sight in the air but I'm not goin alive I swear

(Outro)
I'll blast myself 'No son' Nigga back up all y'all back up
I'm puttin this gun to my motherfuckin head 'No put thst gun down son'

Verse 1 *(Yukmouth)*
Balla position
Regime niggas fuck all'a ya women draped up in linen
I spit this fly shit since I was 5 years old 
On some 'ol Osh Kosh Bi'Gosh shit
Toss ya bitch, keep it top secret, lock it
Smoke-A-Lot click, walkin around wit ounces in they pockets
Bitches jock it
We ridin Benz's, ya'll still drivin 50 rockets
Nigga don't knock it
But you need to stop it
Top notch shit
I used to cop bricks
Rock it up an chop like La-Bobbitt
Pushin the 5 whip through the projects til the led 9 spits
Nigga you rhyme sick, but you could never fuck around wit my shit
My click my crew nigga
That hard time shit
Criminal minded, posted on the grind shit
That cone silencer for one time shit
Turnin, pounds into ashes
Drinkin Cristal from the bottle
Fuck ya glasses
Smokin Black-N-Milds to the plastic
The last trial was kinda drastic
Limo driver got his ass kicked, tryin to sue us
BUT YOU LOST YOU FUCKIN BASTARD!
I'm A-1 Yola juss like the package
Delivered in triple wrappin
Niggas get blasted an put in a casket
Ashes to ashes an dust to dust, when they fuck wit Yuk
Plus I got my own record label
SO WHAT THE FUCK IS UP!

Verse 2 *(Phats Bossi)*
When things is usual we pop Christy
An stack them Bentley's
Ya pockets empty pretending to be me
They name me Bossi
My whole click rich like we the Cosby's
Slippin's costly
It's cut-throat so fuck a softie
In head to head combat
You scared to bust back
An trust that
Call the Regime we known to pull gats in black hats
Hop out the company truck
Give a fuck, fill my cup an celebrate wit Yuk
Now that we grown ups
Rock alligators an bumpin slow cuts
Juss like the Sho Nuff, we can't be touched
I was raised ruff
Gang banged an hand cuffed
Fightin ??? always showin my guts, flexin my nuts
Hand me my 'Uervo
Flip work like we was Trader Joe's from Cisco
Optimo, now it's X-O
Fightin my ??? for death
Pray it's my brother that's kept
When you owe, pay ya debt an we can make it some ???

Verse 3 *(Gonzoe)*
We got it bundled up
Gimme my scratch
It's juss my turn an I'ma take mine
Trap
Nigga don't get attached
Tryin to soak up, listenin
Tryin to locate my donuts an hit 'em
While we juss got on fuckin up my business
Never finished
Til we give up the plate
Extra innings
Swing for the fence
You think too little
Your world dance wit mud puddles
My shit Evian, I love trouble
Start wisperin wit ya hands wide open, watchin you huddle
Big every down
Everybody got guns, let 'em ring
You fuckin wit me, let's all go out wit a bang
In this last day, this last hour
Cool-aid chest cowards wit they life in my hands set off the power
Lights out
??? the whole house
Wit a gallon of gas to douse
Light a flame an flush 'em out
Every slug count
Miss an get your stripes took
Nigga this is real life wit real names written in the black books!

*(Chorus)*
Throw up yo hands if you Thugged Out!
First nigga act up, first nigga gettin drugged out!
Throw up yo hands if you Thugged Out!
First nigga act up, first nigga gettin drugged out!

First nigga act up, first nigga gettin drugged out!

First nigga act up, first nigga gettin drugged out!

Verse 4 *(Poppa L.Q.)*
(Check it)
Ever since I was a youngsta been wit this slick shit
Tryin to touch a quick one, number one ???
Turn an 18 to a full 36 ain't jokin that's how we did it 
We was natural born chemists
Ballin wit this, Benjamin big heads in my fist
Got ya life in my pocket an more than that on my wrist
I got my degree in the concreate of S.C.
Comprised wit gettin paper, an started investin in me
Utilized my hustle skills beyond my record deal
And time will reveal whose really holdin the skrill
Playboy ya lackin, ain't touchin my tax brackets
You fuckin wit some thugs, wit some multi-million dollar ???
An if it's on an crackin then my reaction is clappin
Is you gon' make it happen or is ya high cappin?
Ya betta get to trackin playboy if you ain't packin
Smoke-A-Lot, Regime is distributin max ???
Spent years over the stove in a mini-factory lab
Where illegal pharmaceudicals were sold
I was probably 10 years old when I learned to disassemble 
Then reassemble a semi-auto matic pistol blind fold!

Verse 5 *(Tech N9ne)*
(1-5-1)
They call me Regime, 'cause I'm way clean in stay Beam

Before this rap shit
I used to slang crack wit ghetto bastards
Pack automatic gats an kept scratch up under the mattress
Fuck this rap shit
Yay wrapped in plastic everyday practice
Runnin' away from task tactics
Hop fences leavin' 'em ass backwards
Before this music 
I used to be the Ice Cream Man since 1992 biatch!
Don't you hear the mutha fuckin muzik?
I got a head but ain't no screws in it, losin' it
Slangin' narcotics, them men two steps away from usin' it
Abusin' it
I moved then it was all bad
It seemed like soon as a nigga moved, then it was all bad
Because of this music, my whole block double crossed me
Got shot in the ass, bra 
But ain't no love lost see
'cause now I have yo ass off the g's
An niggas found off the beach, wit holes up in they body for tryin' to 
Double cross me
I could move across seas, and outta state
Smokin' weed
Hand yo ass an 8 to smoke to the face 
Ya still hate nigga.

[Chorus]
'cause I'm that nigga you Love 2 Hate
Tell yo bitch it's that nigga you Love 2 Hate

Young nigga, wit money, you Love 2 Hate
Mutha fuckas lookin' at me funny, you Love 2 Hate
Check it.
What?
Nigga uh.

Is it because I went on tour wit Biggie Smalls?
Or is it because yo bitch will to drop to the floor an lick my balls?
Or is it because a nigga sky ball, since juvenile hall?
To make these niggas straight talk shit, about me in front of they 
Broads, listen!
Or is it because I'm ridin' around in Range Rove's?
4 point 6, G-S 400 on dubb mo-mo's
An both of my shit's got T.V.'s in 'em, what you don't know
What the fuck you grind fo?
Juss to pay note to the nine-four
I'm ridin' 9-8 shit
Is that the reason for all the hatred
I flipped Townhouse, you still at mom's house basement
Mad, walkin around tellin my friends I ain't shit
Back when, you used to be that nigga who I smoked my dank wit
Rob a bank wit, because I trust you
Probably take a slug fo you
But now a nigga got no love fo you
Nigga!
Best friends became enemies for centuries
An jealousy juss means you mutha fuckas envy me.

It's that nigga you love 2 hate
Labeled to the face, nigga you love 2 hate

Tell yo potnas it's that nigga you love 2 hate
Playa hate all the time, you love 2 hate
What?
Why you hate me nigga?

Uh.
Is it because yo bitch love me?
Or is because I stay whipped in all the latest rugby's
Thugged out, sippin' bubbly
""Da Good, Da Bad, Da Ugly"", nigga finally livin' lovely
Signin' autographs 
Lil kids run up an hug me
I'm from where they from, I was raised by crackheads an junkies
High school flunky 
Too busy out there tryin' to get my money
Hungry, I had to get it myself nobody dishin' fo me
An now my niggas mad, claim that I ain't dishin' fo he
But fuck ya'll nigga!
What the fuck you done fo me?
But talk shit behind my back, and try an smoke my weed
Or is it because I used to funk wit $hort an Master P
Hatin' niggas after me, but now won't capture me
Nigga you can't even go gold
What the fuck you sold?
Five thousand units, nigga my shit went platinum across the globe
Or is it because these fake ass hoes claim they got my baby
Act shady, an crazy, reverse the game an now them bitches pay me
The day a nigga signed wit Prince J
Got rid of them other niggas, became my own sensai 
Smoke-A-Lot, I got to record lable also
Phats, L.Q., Maxx, KeKe, my nigga Gonzoe
Colloso, cheddar to make the nitros soggy
Ridin' Harley's, die smokin' juss like Bob Marley

Whoever try to buy a new Benz, spend money on your friends
Order up some shit with a pocket full of ends
Ain't no sympathy for suckers, bitch, I'm a hustler
For the last 12 years I could never get enough of
That cash, I keep it in my jeans, bitch
Have you ever seen it? A big pile of green shit?
When I spend it, bitch, I'm the man
I do what I want, suckers do what they can
That's why I moved to the A, straight from the Bay
I'm still mackin bitches everyday, anyway
And if you don't like it, I don't give a fuck
I'ma still let my top down and turn this shit up
Nothin' half on my business, keep gettin' paid
If niggas stick together, maybe we'll live to see the day
When everybody keep ballin like me and my folks

Havin' menage-a-trois, x-ed out on the celly with Todd
""Short Dog, what's up?"" He told me Roger Troutman passed
I hollered, my shit about to crash
Copped a block of hash, an ounce of grass
Damn! poppin' Crystal, poured me a glass
Then poured the whole rest of the bottle out on the flo' for yo' ass
This's for my nigga Roger, the godfather of futuristic funk
Here's the ganja, get it crunk
Twist the skunk, hit it once
And keep that shit movin and
Thug niggas do what they want to, and busta niggas do what you're doin
I went from rags to riches, bagged bitches, Jags and 6's
To droppin a solo album that's sellin' more than the last shit did

I was out here doin' it way too live
Doin' way too much, I'm tryin to touch forty million bucks
And flip a jet with some ?, about fourteen
Flop through your hood, bumpin' this shit, smokin sticky green

Huh, We blaze em up with AK's, double my clip and we dip
Set trip and get hit, flip Crip or get zipped
Run with the Crips, catch me clumsy in the 6
6 rag invertable slide divertible, murder ya
Dead and gone never heard of ya
Now we stuffin' lead in the chrome, bout to hurt ya
Pack ya down in the earth, we put work in like Mad Dirt
Ordainers twistin' like the revolver or the earth
Fuck church, it's a must I burst and curse
Yeah I'm a West Coast Bad Boy but a thousand times worst
Dime piece, gun in her purse, one in her skirt
Cross me, bet ya life that my bitch burst
Got me lockin' down the world for the North Pole
Too cold to hold lyrics froze my wrist and my hoes
Number one Thug Lord, fuck wit us!
I won't lie the whole world gonna rush wit us, tell em

Thug Lord niggas boss up and don't stop

Nigga you listenin' to the B-O-S-S-I-L-I-N-I
Yukmouth and C-Bo you know they label us born to die
But I pistol slap you and two niggas like 3 Stooges
Walk over to the bar and sip on Gin and juice
It's just the gangster in me, the thug in me
Mug in me and get yo fro pushed back like homie
You lil' clown ass nigga walkin' in bozo shoes
While my niggas out here doin hits, makin' the news
What you think you gon' dodge these bullets like Matrix?
Like a condom, I even lay teck on a bitch
Now that's some cold shit, a low lick, a cold hit
Leave a nigga at a funeral cryin' with no bitch
Some Thug Lord shit nigga shoot up ya coffin
Niggas cross game get murdered by bosses
Cost's yo mutha fuckin' life when you play with the rules
They got a n-uh-nigga still singin' the blues

Bitch, next up to bat, Yukmouth destroy the earth with rap
Imagine pain worse than that, my niggas coppin' birds of crack
Servin' track, cock back and burst the gat
I want my turf back, I hurt that, work that, twerk that
Rolex speed spot like Joe Pesci
AK ready, we deadly, bitch!
I'm like Hannibal, rector eat MC's for breakfast
I'm the hardest artist to sign to a label in Texas
Yes it's that nigga with the platinum grill full of princesses
Invisible set, straight up herbal molescents
In less than 60 seconds I kill em leavin' em breathless
Don't fuck with bread, run outta' state bit records
With chin checkers in Benz stretches who win cheddar
When fakers scramble liquid hands on niggas with vendettas
I'm like 10 fraredders bustin' off at the same time
Payed rhymes, I kick shit off when it's game time

I'm hittin' niggas so hard with these you would need Jesus
Believe these is yo last days I can see you cleavage
That's why I'm fuckin' you with the 9 millimeter
And I feed a nigga with the heater, he was a long bleeder
And he taste good with fajitas, heat em up now eat
Member me? Nigga that be eatin' raw meat
With tiger claw feet so it's easy to creep
You leave me no reason but to leave niggas bleedin'
Receive grievance with extra Season of the Sicc
I pick em off like Brock Marion
He kept starin so I took care of him, shot him up with heroin
Like malt liquor, to the liver hitter, to the river wit ya
Dip ya down deep, down deep
Where pirahna heat they eat they meat
Heat up they seats, they seats with metal from the Southside ghetto
I swear I'll make why'all mutha fuckas yellow
Tired of diggin' ditches like the GoodFellows
Not good with mellow, I keep the meat
Keep it hangin' in the closet like pig feet
Delete, come with the

If you lived my life
You would straight commit suicide
If you look into my eyes of my life
You would straight commit suicide

[Yukmouth]
Lord I sacrifice my life
Just to bring my mama back to life
Just to bring my father back to life
Just to bring my potnas back to life
My father hustled slangin' slabs at night
That got my mama addicted to crack and pipe
Raised in the motherfuckin' 6-5 Village with no gas, no lights
Hungry as fuck sleepin' on the floor with an appetite
Me and my sister awake to buckshots and flashin' lights
My father been in jail half his life
Became a black geurrilla family soulja
taught me how to slang blast it right
Considered me a bastard right
Family be the back stabbin' type
My cousin's tried to have me blasted twice
why'all niggas live the average life
Raised in the hills with the wife, then turn gangsta when ya grab the mic
Nigga I only spit the facts of life
From bein' homeless to sleepin' on them mats at nights
To prayin' for my parents in the afterlife
I still hear whispers, still shiver
Still remember bein' a filthy ass field nigga
Payless shoes, rocked clothes from Goodwill nigga
Salvation Army just to eat my next meal nigga
Where they slang to pay the bills nigga
why'all playin' doorbell ditch, I'm dodgin' bullets with them real killas
Drug dealers with wild figgas, all the makin's of a foul nigga
Lived off food stamps and medicare stickers
The first and fifthtenth was like like Thanksgivin and Christmas
Cause that's the only time we fitted with food up in the kitchen
Little boys and girls listen
I got so many homies in this world missin' for tryna twirl chickens
Where they taught to pack berattas, stack cheddar
When the Village was termed the Felix Mitchell, D and Black era
Real goodfellas, the whole Ville was down for whatever
Protected by three letters, crazy like Micheal Shellers
Fool I been round since niggas was screamin' rollers
Comin' down finham
When Felix Mitchell shut the block didown
I'm from the block were niggas get killed and shot
While the neighbors sit in the window and watch, don't call the cops
I'm from the block were the twelve year old is gotta play pops
To support my mama and sister, gotta slang rocks
Aim glocks, dodge stray shots, runnin' from cops hoppin' fences
Relentless dreams of havin' a mansion mobbin' Benzes
I used to have visions until I copped my first sentence
For a eleven, three, fifty tossed me a year I straight pimped it
An I lost several ramps, doin' time at camp
Rollin' dice for stamps, why-A commitment if I bamp
Got out with a plan, call Garick my man
They whole time I was locked I wrote shit like Ice Cream Man
An that's a ringup I call Knumskull my nigga
Lets call the group the Lunitoonz nigga lets make this scrilla
Hooked up with Chris Hicks and Dru Down my nigga
Dropped this album I'm still slangin' pounds and zippers
Then dropped the first underground album around niggas
Like Teddy Bohana and Supa Side them down niggas
Around the same time my mama died so tragic
I'm in traffic with gats up under the mats, cracked wrapped in plastic
Triple beam, be	-12, and seran wrap, money rubberband wrapped
Second album goes gold they can't stand that
In 95 the year my pops died
Start ballin' in 96 when Pac died
Bought me a Lexus, start catchin' hawkeyes
Now my family members tryna Suge Knight me
The whole Ville sheisty but now them mothafuckas don't like me
When I was broke it was all good
When I was smokin' and hav-a-tampa's to the wood it was all good
I been around the world and back fuck this small hood
I'm tryna ball and have it all playa we all should
I started off broke as fuck, nigga ain't no way to go but up
Now I'm in a Rover truck, smokin' dro, never sobered up
Drinkin' X-O until I throw it up, nobody can flow like Yuk
Hooked up with Rap-A-Lot nigga blow shit up
80 Thousand the first week nigga put them posters up
Tha first nigga with platinum teeth on the west coast is Yuk
Niggas probably get smoked just for standin' close to Yuk
I'm blessed with a son and daughter
It's like the reincarnation of my mother and father comtinue the saga
My wife be like a gift from heaven
I would have been slit my wrist and jumped off a cliff
From stressin' maldepression
Life is like a big ass lesson we all go through
Friends you was close to all of a sudden want to smoke you
They all deceitful; I got shot up by a nigga I knew since pre-school
His mama and my mama used to be cool
We from the same street too
That's why I don't creep through
Niggas who rob you and try to kill you ain't yo peoples
Niggas who beat you with desert eagles ain't yo peoples
Niggas who jack you for them kilos that ain't yo peoples
But ain't gonna be no sequel cause next time I'm gonna show em somethin'
Make it out the hood, niggas act like you owe em somethin'
Niggas want you to throw em somethin'
I've been robbed, stuffed in a trunk then
Dumped in a fuckin' alleyway head lookin' like a pumpkin'
for fuckin' with my own cousins
I ask the lord why I'm the worlds most hated
Like Pac they want a nigga assassinated
Judges give me hundred G bonds for fake ass cases
Bail out, can't be faded, rock platinum bracelets
Hair braided, jewelry like Sammie Davis in Vegas
Smellin' like acres of sticky shit rolled in vega's
Havin' paper comes with a shit load of haters
That's why my only friend is my lord and savior
Fuck them haters

Everytime I smoke

It happens every time I drink
Somebody better call my shrink
I'll beat it 'til the pussy's weak
Some niggaz don't sleep man I don't blink
Sometimes I think I over-think
Sometimes I feel like, somebody's watchin me

You motherfuckers can't figure it
Why niggaz so ignorant, ignorant
You motherfuckers can't figure it
Why niggaz so ignorant, ignorant
We drink beer and smoke cigarettes
Cause we niggaz so ignorant, ignorant
We bang bang cause we ignorant
Motherfuckers can't figure it, figure it

[Kokane]
I'm the epitome of this rap game
The most controversial name, they call me Kokane
I'm so ignorant, black ladies be hidin they purse with white ladies
Fifty niggaz in a Navigator, and a Range Rover
Blowin bomb sticky doja
Lookin at these studio gangsters gettin over
It's Yuk and Kokane and Nate Dogg, we stay true
Snatch yo wack ass off stage - we all gonna laugh at you
Ah, I wear the same khakis for about four days
And I, I don't brush my teeth, cause I got tooth decay
I keep the door open when I shit
And if I'm fucked up sometimes, I forget to flush it EWWW
Fuck respectin my elders, they ain't gon' get it soft
Cut in front of a 80 year old lady, and flip her ass off
I taught my 13 year old son how to slang
PCR, Dogghouse when I bang, and I'm out, nigga

[Chorus]

[Yukmouth]
What? Nigga, ery'thang, ery'thang..
Motherfuckers get sprayed fuckin wit Yuk, Kokane and Nate
Since back in the day, been slangin crack nay, packin a gauge
Diamond taps on our braids, pack a case, stack it away
Y'all niggaz perform overseas then back to the states
When subtractions are made, thug money the blueprint
+Regime Killers+, my click too sick, we rule shit
And to spit at a few clicks, rob motherfuckers who move bricks
Pop motherfuckers wit loose lips
Bitches who snitch out's finna get hit, get put in a ditch
Yukmouth runnin, livin this shit
""Ice Cream Man,"" I invented this shit
Ain't no gimmicks to this, my shit is rugged and hardcore
Give Killa Cali niggaz what they starve for
Bring y'all war like, ""What's the issue?""
I shoot up everybody, even an ugly fat bitch too
If I get you (?) (?) another shit on you ridiculous
Give that nigga some tissue, let that bitch know, I'm ig'nant

Are you real motherfuckers, for real motherfucker?
Well I ain't real, I'm ultramagnetic bitch
I'm somethin you don't wanna fuck wit
I'm the nigga wit the pistol, launchin six from the clip
I'ma eclipse the moon like pitch black nigga
Nate, Yuk, Kokane, Kurupt we back nigga
Yak in a 'llac nigga, Young ready to collapse lungs
Two shots make slums collapse niggaz
See me face to face, talk that shit
Pretend you on the +moon+ Michael +walk+ that shit
What up pretty mama, a.k. pretty bitch
This Kurupt, I know you fucks to get rich
I met many bitches, in my day
Got the homies on the left side, holdin the 'K

Highly hated, top graded
Ig'nant than a motherfucker, I don't give a fuck

y'all niggaz ride Bentley's (Bentley's), not Mercedes (not Mercedes)
Bentley's (Bentley's), so why y'all niggaz hatin' on me?
(quit hatin', nigga) y'all got money (what? what? nigga)

[Verse 1]
Mama used to say: ""Watch your friends"", 'cause they be fake as fuck
Niggaz smilin' in my face, I'm knowin' they hate my guts
They hate the way I bust, hate the way I strut
They want to take my stuff, kill a nigga to make a buck
They even hate the way I fuck, 'cause I fuck they ho's
When I bust, fuck up their flow, Yuk untouchable
Platinum make a nigga tuck his gold, Ice up his robe
My lyrics touch your soul, make bitches rush the flow
I give it to 'em raw, regaurdless of what squad
I'ma hit 'em hard if they get envolved, break them niggaz off
Let 'em know I'm rollin' with god, roll with the MOB
If you fuck with one of us, the whole club about to squab
Your bitch gettin' shot, even your mama gettin' robbed
Fuck try'na hold haah, I sold rock, I sold haah
From the thug spot, coke spot, post up, and tote glocks
Got it if you snort haah, got it if you smoke rocks
It don't stop late, niggaz get dropped from labels
For fuckin' with a nigga that's hot and fatal
I'm like the henny, rock the cradle to these little ass pre-schooler
Nursery rhyme niggaz, still ridin' beach cruisers
Dude, I see through you, 'cause you're plastic
Bring the beef to you, put the heat to your vlastic
Fuck the last album, this a classic
Fags get put inside a casket, cliques get blasted
by them niggaz tatted with dragons

I'm try'na live one time shine (why can't a nigga ball like y'all
With platinum plaques on my wall?)
But y'all niggaz platinum, what's mine? (they don't want to nigga to shine at all
They wish a young nigga would fall)
'Cause I'm the world's most hated, world's most hated
world's most hated nigga, nigga
'Cause I'm the world's most hated, world's most hated
world's most hated nigga, nigga

[Verse 2]
You need to quit it, all I got is 6 digits, you got meal tickets
Talk slick in your raps, and pillow talk to bitches
y'all niggaz ought to quit it, god's my witness
Or face the consequences, like when Eryka Badu sparks an inscent
You 'bout to get lalla-byed, rock-a-byed
Popped the guy, shot the guy, then went in the pockets of his Karl Kani's
Robbed the guy, got the guy, don't forget to dot your eyes
Cross me, you got to die, I'ma ride
MAKE YOU FEEL LIKE PAC ALIVE!
The Thug lord, prophesize, bring the west back
Shit on them niggaz with no ex-lax
Make them bitches eat, check that
Then put my tape in, make them niggaz respect that
And stop P.H.in', and congratulatin' the nigga they facin'
Who went from section 8, to makin' money, listen to revelations
And Jags and Navigations, PlayStation, stay breakin'
Platinum deuce, conversations to rule a thug nation

Still the king of the O. would be that nigga smokin' weed

Or said shit about that thug nigga, leavin' they head split, detted
I'll make you muthafuckaz regret it, get wetted with the gun
For try'na gas me like unleaded, I ain't the fuckin' one, one, one
So take that gum out your ass hole
First round, T.K.O. his ass like ""Glass Joe""
I lash you, harass you, thrash you 
Smash you, blast you, I put holes in your shirt like cash do
I probably have to stop to find his ass too
Hit the avenue, in his strip, bullet proof Nav. too, if niggaz was after you
Try'na catch you niggaz, jack you for puttin' a nigga name in your raps, fool(fag you!)

Now I can't seem to get rid of this cough
Ain't been many jobs these last few months
And the last one I had I got laid off

I ain't got no hot water and they shut off the heat
Can you loan me some money for something to eat
Been out here on this corner for about a week
Tryin' hard to stand on my own two feet

They want to try and tell me where I can live
They kicked me off my land and told me they'd give me
A nice little tract house with running water
But how am I gonna explain that to my Navajo mother

Everything I said I do, I did

Baby lets face it, I'm not into dating
I haven't been patient
Ever since I been famous my time has been racing
My motives are basic, this life I been chasing
These hearts I been breaking (Sorry)
And these girls I been tasting don't never get naked
They like it in a head lock fuck them from behind
Fuck them with their clothes on, put it to the side
Feelings to the side like a Don do
Get 'em wet, let it slide like a sunroof
Got goals, got dreams
Got a hotel, Crib
Got niggas that'll die for the prince
Got my city on lock, XO till the death
Left town in a coach came back in a jet

I'm good, I'm not living like I did before
I'm good, I'm good, I said I'm good

Skip the brand name - I won't brand you
What you do here'll stay here like cancun
Besides your breasts is augmented - I like things authentic
Look at all my whips, they're all vintage
I got a loft with a view of the sea
See I take some more shit and make it new for me

Sometimes I feel like, somebody's watchin me

I'm the epitome of this rap game
The most controversial name, they call me Kokane
I'm so ignorant, black ladies be hidin they purse with white ladies
Fifty niggaz in a Navigator, and a Range Rover
Blowin bomb sticky doja
Lookin at these studio gangsters gettin over
It's Yuk and Kokane and Nate Dogg, we stay true
Snatch yo wack ass off stage - we all gonna laugh at you
Ah, I wear the same khakis for about four days
And I, I don't brush my teeth, cause I got tooth decay
I keep the door open when I shit
And if I'm fucked up sometimes, I forget to flush it EWWW
Fuck respectin my elders, they ain't gon' get it soft
Cut in front of a 80 year old lady, and flip her ass off
I taught my 13 year old son how to slang
PCR, Dogghouse when I bang, and I'm out, nigga

Motherfuckers get sprayed fuckin wit Yuk, Kokane and Nate
Since back in the day, been slangin crack nay, packin a gauge
Diamond taps on our braids, pack a case, stack it away
Y'all niggaz perform overseas then back to the states
When subtractions are made, thug money the blueprint
+Regime Killers+, my click too sick, we rule shit
And to spit at a few clicks, rob motherfuckers who move bricks
Pop motherfuckers wit loose lips
Bitches who snitch out's finna get hit, get put in a ditch
Yukmouth runnin, livin this shit
""Ice Cream Man,"" I invented this shit
Ain't no gimmicks to this, my shit is rugged and hardcore
Give Killa Cali niggaz what they starve for
Bring y'all war like, ""What's the issue?""
I shoot up everybody, even an ugly fat bitch too
If I get you (?) (?) another shit on you ridiculous
Give that nigga some tissue, let that bitch know, I'm ig'nant

Well I ain't real, I'm ultramagnetic bitch

I'ma eclipse the moon like pitch black nigga

Yak in a 'llac nigga, Young ready to collapse lungs
Two shots make slums collapse niggaz
See me face to face, talk that shit
Pretend you on the +moon+ Michael +walk+ that shit
What up pretty mama, a.k. pretty bitch
This Kurupt, I know you fucks to get rich
I met many bitches, in my day
Got the homies on the left side, holdin the 'K

Highly hated, top graded

A German car but I got a Portuguese chauffeur
No penny loafers, I ain't Mike But I'm Bad nigga
And for that paper I'll get up in yo ass nigga
You too commercial, I'll hurt you and let that nine squirt you

Wrist glitted, car kitted, I'm so gutter
Even when it's Winter time I got fo' hustlers
But when you get rich that's when the snakes come
I had to figure out the real niggas from the fake ones

Y'all rappers buyin' adapters we ridin' on real spinners
With goons and gorillas we ridin' with real killers

Y'all stompin' artist, all of my rocks flawless
Still get the whole club jumpin' like hydraulics

Still keep a flock of hoes at Roscoe's and Pappadeux
Rose gold and black diamonds is Rocky Road
Still aim, lock, and load, they'll kill you for some stop-n-go's
I rep the Westcoast, Flip represent the South
Shine with the down payment for a house in my mouth
I rock chains like Slick Rick in '82

They're gonna build a Toyland all around the Christmas tree
So! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why

Now Santa is a busy man, He has no time to play
He's got millions of stockings to fill on Christmas day
You'd better write your letter now
And mail it right away
Because he's getting ready
His reindeer's and his sleigh. So

That you tried to claim
Closer, pulling over
Call me when you know
I can feel the turning 
Back to indigo

Those headlights off and bended
You said that you had gone before
Those moments when we mended
Every single vision, every single rift you wore

I make of dedication to break the expectation
And all we could do, to avoid you lately
Three weeks, I hardly believe you
Two months that you deceive aren't enough to be cruel
Couldn't you avoid this feeling?

But now you see me
And I don't have faith 
Fighting off the reasons
That you tried to claim
Closer, pulling over
Call me when you know
I can feel the turning 
Back to indigo

When you think again of sleep
Tell me what you're really meaning
And I try somehow but I can't [?] my time
And something could leave us wordless

And I don't have faith 
Fighting off the reasons
That you tried to claim
Closer, pulling over

If it's gonna be you, it's gotta be right
No time for games in my life
I just want this to be special, special

This is like the third time ya said you was through
I'm beggin' ya back, we loud in the parking lot causin' a scene
Campaignin' like the love ain't have no resident here
Still I stay all in the cabin
Although I know we've seen enough of good days and dirt
You cut me just to nurse me back but damn I'd understand it
You gave ya all and I just gave it up
Put the truck in ya name
Damn ya should've known I was liability
Ignorin' the ways you would dress for a nigga
Express to a nigga I heard jibber and jabber
My apologies I left the wrong man to conduct
Take these jewels for the inconvience and neglect
You expect the worst of it
But I realize that I owe you more than explanation
 
I got my life in a box, what I'm supposin' is a joint account
It's cash on it, let's take our lil' business and incorporate it
It's me and you girl

First of all love, your soul caller
Before me helped create and shape your distorted image
See every man don't play or even scrimmage
That's a lie but I'm try to be that only one
You look to, to make you smile
First you need to check my files
Understand I play the partners stereotypical man
An regret the pain I may have left to flame
My people say 'Yo that's a fine girl ya mess with'
But I told em' we havin' a mess
Ya charm must have calluses from the grip
That it has on my heart that I ain't tryin' to rip
But by now we both should know
That it's no longer where ya at but where we tryin' to go
So do ya background checks so I can pass through these borders
And stamp my name on a lil' man or a daughter
Come on girl

Yummy Bingham,"Take it to the top
Yea, that's where we at with it
Take it to the top
Just cause you are a character
Don't mean you have character
We taking stock right now
You ready? Let's go

A wise man know what he know and what he doesn't
If he's not really sure what he's saying, he don't discuss it
A righteous man walks the earth without judgment
And loves his enemies enough to deliver justice
A pious man relies on religion for his direction
At times he introspective, but his bible he'll never question
A dying man will make a confession, try to get into heaven
Thinking his lifestyle is blocking his blessing
A violent man will stock up on weapons and go to war for his
Get post-traumatic stress disorder, become an officer
A man of peace uses his words in different mediums
He'll bleed for his beliefs practicing civil disobedience
An honest man knows only lies are scared of the truth
His word is his bond, but his action's always to prove
A faithful man never need evidence to believe
But still he gotta work for the blessings that he receives
Let's go

Sometimes it's hard to believe
In what you don't see, I understand
But the picture is so much bigger
Than what we could even imagine
It's hard to feel better
When the weight of the world make you feel sadder
Put your faith into action
Heads up and eyes open

Top tier niggas blossomed in the basement
All the nights that we were lacking those refreshments
Rain down, thunder storm with the flows
Articulate with the bounce, now I'm back like I'm Derrick Rose
Once the one on the bench with the snotty nose
Nefertiti would hold me when I was cold
Communion Sunday, my twenties, went in the bowl
Forgive me lord for them bitches the night before
Binny's deals And these Bentleys I can't afford
Gotta be the example for children to do their chores
Blowing weed smoke on the cover of The Source
Rolling Stones on the blunted was the boss
Fallen soldier on his own so we march
Roll up a bag of that weed, therefore I spark
Recite the Quran, I'm in the dark
Devil knocking on my door, he like a narc

Sometimes it's hard to believe
In what you don't see, I understand
But the picture is so much bigger
Than what we could even imagine
It's hard to feel better
When the weight of the world make you feel sadder
Put your faith into action
Heads up and eyes open

No excuses, if I start it then I'll see it through
God is what I see in you, so you might as well believe in you
Think what you see on TV's true? The media deceiving you
They misrepresent and misquote and then they misleading you
Belief is a funny thing, in case you're wondering
If they want the ring, they coming for the throne like they the sons of kings
These average rappers is acting up for the dough
Yeah I tell you what I believe, but I back it up with what I know
It's the facts versus the facts simile, your raps killing me
My last victory was great moments of Black history
I celebrated with a bottle I just brought back from Italy
And some loud, I got super packs like I backed Hillary
Lost in desire, I walked through the devil's fire
I inspire the resurrection of kings like Hezekiah
The trust you put in me to be a beast with this rhyming
That's where the rubber meets the road and where your faith meets science
Let's go

Sometimes it's hard to believe
In what you don't see, I understand
But the picture is so much bigger
Than what we could even imagine
It's hard to feel better
When the weight of the world make you feel sadder
Put your faith into action
Heads up and eyes open

Take it to the top, take it to the top
Take it to the top, take it to the top
Take it to the top, take it to the top",Heads Up Eyes Open,2017

Hustle from the beginning of January til the end of December

Got the deal nothing changed but my clothes
Still catch me in the jects fuckin' wit' dem hoes (projects!)

Plus I been in the commercials when I watch TV
And everybody know I rep these streets faithfully

Should I let you come over?

That girl in your arms does she know where you come from?

Almost made me move out of town

Legs super thick
You know the type you can't wait to go spread apart
Had her from the start
Took it to the waist
Where her top came down
For I throw it out of car
And still to this day
I hop into the Guicci man
Records on the radio
Like I'll do anything (for you)
So tell me what am I to do
I know this song changed
So I let this song play(for you)

Now its 1 blood against 8 or 9 niggas
I'm like whats up? whats up?
I'm the youngin' who had a deal 
Before I could legally a nickle roll
Blame Snoop for me being in the coupe
Blowin' L's bangin' out to Beanie Sigels the Truth
Layin' more p for me mashin' out
Cause real niggas hit me when the cash is out
Ask Pac let me rent his thug mansion out
Thats why I can write what her wrote and put a classic out
I don't need a platinum plaque
I just want to do gold like Old Dirty Bastards mouth

A youngin' on big niggas sort of like Kevin
Johnson when he did to Hakeem
Playin' dame dash, biggin' up my team
And I seem, naive or a little obscene
You can blame everybody but not me
And I've seen niggas with deals who don't know how to use it
Why, cause they ain't a product of the music

Yung Chill,"(Intro)
Take a look at me.
Take a look at me now.
Take a look.


(Verse 1)
Once upon a time, not too long ago
Down in the great state of Texas where we live life slow
I was born amongst poverty, I had no dough
Motivated by a dream with some hustle and flow
My paper was never long but my ambition was strong
Followin Gods path, I could never go wrong
I took a road less traveled and I got a few scrapes
But the journey was all worth it just to get that cake
Mama told me I would make it, some fools just laughed
But I remembered how The Bible say ""The first shall be last.""
And even thought all the teams skipped over me in the draft
I ignored all the haters and perfected my craft
Times change, and nowadays to me it seem funny
The same people hatin, callin me up to borrow money
But I hold no grudge, I just forgave and forgot
I guess that's the reason I made it to the top
Take a look at me now...

(Hook)
Haters said that I would never get this paper
But Ima see my money regardless
Got the soul of a hustla
When it comes to gettin my bread...
...Im heartless
Take a look at me now
Take a look at me now
Take a look at me now
Take a look at me now
Take a look at me now

It's the Houston Hard Hitter out the 713, 
It's ""The People's Champ,"" Paul Wall, yeah that's me.
Come take a ride with a playa out the 'Lone Star State'.
I'm just a hustler on the grind known for gettin' that cake.
I came up from the bottom, now I reside at the top.
I used to run away from cops, but now it's benzes I cop.
I used to post up on the block like Yao Ming in the paint,
But now I pimp the parkin' lot, drivin' slow n sippin' drank.
With Ashanti on my side as I glide like Clyde, 
And nothin' less than 24 inches of chrome on my ride.
It's just somethin' bout the way I tip 4's 
And grip grain and got these boppers on the sidelines goin insane.
I got 'em moanin', my mackin' game is outta
Control, but I don't know if it's my looks or my big bank roll.
I'm 24 years old with my mouth all gold, 
My games cold and now the stories been told.
It's Paul Wall, baby (baby).

See I don't know why (why)
I'm feelin' just the way I do (do)
It's been a long time (time)
I thought that I was over you, but now you're coming around again
I'll be remembering what you said
I just can't take it, and I don't wanna go back, oh no.

[Chorus]
What is a girl to do, if she's still on it, yes
If she done been there before with you, and now she don't want it, yeah
We've spent time and time again.
I just wish this thing would end.
Tell me, what is a girl to do, if she's still on it.

Whenever we talk (talk)
It feels like we had somethin' strong (strong)
And knowin' it's wrong, we tried to do this thing before, 
But when you coming real close to me
Bringing back all of them memories
I just can't fake it, but I don't wanna go back, oh no.

[Chorus]

(uhn, yeah)
Auntie Ashanti's a problem, this track here's a problem.
The best thing rockin' since that cotton came to Harlem.
Meth darlin', I'm like that Hershey with the almonds, 
And I don't pay for nothin', but your pardon.
They start and I finish.
My animals is starvin' for dinners
Straight up menace, y'all don't get involved in my business. 
Look, I witness, spotted like a blemish, off gimmicks.
I'm 59/50 authenic.
Tilted with that NY on it.
There's money to be made, and I want it.
See, my palm been itchin' for the longest, so scratch that, paper like NASDAQ.
We laughed that life, roll the dice, get the cash back, I'm nice.
Plus, I got the juice, so I goes well with ice.
Been drug tested 3 times failed it twice.
Ashanti, you doin' it big, don't hurt 'em auntie.
Matter fact, you killin 'em girl, you're murder mami.

[Chorus]

Hahahahaha yeah

So where your swag at? Huh?
You swagged out (yeah)

See you swagged today,
But its gone tomorrow,
Where your swag at?
I guess your swag is borrowed. (they say)
Diamonds are a girls best friend (best friend)
Yeeah, I just use 'em as a wrist band.
Do these True Religion jeans make me Christian?
And are these Christian Dior's for a blind man,

'Cause they're so dark, I cant see y'all,
A nigga need a flash light just to see y'all, (yeah)
Turn my wrist into a flash light to see y'all,
And turn my watch into a glow ball, weed ball, (lets get some)

[Chorus]

When I wear my watch,
I can't help but notice
That it's time to shine,
So I'm Mr. Focus,
I'm looking for the rakes, I'm looking for the stakes,
You, the Stacks on Deck, then where the money at?
Where the whips at, where your bitches dog,
Stand and brace yourself, looking like a sick dog.
So many hoes on my balls I can't get 'em off,
So many cars in my garage I can't even ball,
And we don't use cash no more, (yeah)
What you use is credit cards now
Okay, what else, yeah it's bank cards now,
Okay, what else, the bank calls us now, (lets go)

[Chorus]

Back from the future,
Future looking gist,
Swag so sick,
I could of been a gypsy,
Scarred from my neck, just like I was a pilot,
Swag so sick, you would of swore I had a stylist,
Your money showed up, but shit my money piled,
Glowing bands in the club, man I call that shit whylin'
Swagga jack a nigga, man that shit childish,
I been had swagger ever since I was a child, (bitch)

These niggas looking sick, I guess they swag is missin', (it's lost)
You could call me for some Swag Assistance, (right now)
All I ask is that you pay tuition, (its life)
And read the terms and conditions, (GO)

Schleuder' sie durchs Bett wie meine Sexpuppe

Ich hänge hier fest, ihre Pussy ist 'ne Trap
Die Welt draußen geht unter, alles brennt
Doch wir bleiben für immer im Motel
Ich schenk' dir mein Geld, all mein Gold und auch mich selbst
Baby, friss mich auf und dann sag mir, wie es schmeckt

Okay, Soda in den Bombay
Mir schießen Gedanken durch den Kopf, als wär' ich Cobain
Am Tresen im Cecconi's, Peroni ist mein Homie
Wer braucht Trophies, wenn ich morgen in 'ner Kiste lieg' aus Holz, Bitch?
Viel zu viel lief schief, ich brauch 'nen Genie
Sie singt diese Lieder über Liebe, aber gib sie
Bis ich an 'nem Beach lieg' mit Angels in Bikinis

What do you mean by you?
How do you know you exist?
In terms of what? What do you discover?
What if you push that? Or—
If I go back, when I'm dead
To the state where I was before I was born
Couldn't I happen again
You know, what happened once can very well happen again
If it happened once it's extraordinary
And it's not really very much more extraordinary
If it happened all over again
There it is, all this happened
And may I introduce you: this is yourself

Neuer Name, neues Leben
Hab mei'm alten Ich 'ne Kugel in den Kopf gegeben
Und wenn der Sensenmann mich sucht, sucht er vergebens
Keiner, der mich kennt, wird mich verraten, so sind hier die Regeln
Vom alten Ego zu mei'm alter Ego
Neues Leben, neue Freunde, heißen Walther P und Money Zero
Verkaufe Steine sowie Lego, bis das Demo kommt
Neues Spiel, neues Ziel, neue I.D

Ah, yeah
Hör' sie bellen, ich hätte mich verändert
Denn sie kommen nicht mehr hinterher, meine Welt dreht schneller
Sei meine Ghetto-Cinderella, steig aufs Karussell
In die Kutsche, ich krieg' Diabetes, Pussy Karamel
Neue Namen, alte Stories
Du willst, dass ich treu bin wie ein Hund und ich will doggy, friss den Knochen
Smoke Weed, bis der Ghost fliegt

Ich bin Kappa, sag meinen neuen Namen 99 mal
Bis ich vergesse wer ich war, zünd' das Feuer an
Bis jede Spur verwischt ist, Hauptsache, sie finden mich nicht

Just like her mama and I ain't sayin' the name brain

I know ya wonder why
I'm so cool
Don't ask me, just do what cha do (Okay)

Meet me in the mall, it's goin' down
Meet me in the club, it's goin' down
Anywhere ya meet me guaranteed to go down

Verse numba two, do the damn thang
Cubes on my neck pockets full of Ben Franks
When I'm in the mall, hoes just pause
I pop a few tags, give me that on the wall
Time to flip the work, make the block bump
Boys in the hood call me black Donald Trump
Dope boy magic seven days a week
Numba one record 'long as Nitty on the beat
Oh, I think they like me betta, yet I know
Lights camera action when I walk through the door
Niggaz know my crew, we certified stars
Valet in the front, 'bout thirty-five cars
Bitches in the back
Black beamer coups
Girls like girls, time to recruit
If ya got a problem, say it to my face
We can knuckle up any time, any place

[Chorus: x2]

Time to set it off, let these niggas know
Have ya every seen a Chevy wit' the butterfly doors?
I ride real slow, no need to speed
Gotta make sure ya see the buckets on my feet
Feds on my trail, but they don't think I know
I keep my hands clean 'cause I never touch dope
Every time I see 'em, look 'em in the eye
Ask me how I know, it's me, suprise!
Put it in the air, rep where ya stay
Take a step back, blow the kush in they face
Stuntin' is a habit, let 'em see the karats
I'm a make it rain, nigga, I ain't scared to share it

It ain't nothing like the first time
I'm tryin' to tell you I can blow your mind
Baby, if I touch you here and kiss you there
Gonna fall in love, shorty, best beware

This ain't no love song
More like a cut song
You say your day was long, well, tell daddy what's wrong
I'm a tell you one time, just relax and unwind
Whisper sweet nothings, now you blushing, chills down your spine
Oh yeah, you hot and tempted
Oh no, not Pretty Ricky
But when you grind on me
I'm a leave you hot and drippin'
Slip in those satin sheets
Now go and roll over
Oh yeah, it's up and down motions like a roller coaster
I see she up on top
You all on my jock
I'm a do it nonstop until your cherry pop
I'm a keep going and going, the energizer bunny
Mr Long John all in your tummy

Won't you let me introduce ya to thug Kamasutra?
This ain't no lovey dovey (nah), but watch how I seduce ya
Girl, I'm the man, I, I, I'm the man
I push the right buttons and the sex on demand
Oh yeah, I like it slow
Baby, be easy
Ooo, watch ya teeth
Baby, be easy
Tell me your Vicky secrets
Tell me all the dirt
You smell like peaches
Must bath and body works
Love the way your body work
I'm a make your body rock
Once you climax, you feel the aftershock
(I know I got you hooked on this lovin'
Don't get it twisted; we just cutin', baby)

[Chorus x 2]

Yeah, I know, I know I still ain't went soft
But I gotta go
Let's hit the shower, baby
It's time to rinse off
I'll wash yours, you wash mine
I adore it the first time
I blew yours, you blew mines
Sometimes I'll drop you a line
But, look, don't tell nobody
Just keep it on the low
Not your best friend, not your cousin
Nobody's gotta know
I know it sounds crazy, but that's just how it is

Knock the pussy out, now she running back
So I knock the pussy out
Knock it out, knock it out

Knock it out, knock it out

First thing first, I likin' all kinda hoes
Some go to school, some dance with no clothes
Mama name me Joc 'cause I do the damn thing
When I throw the dick they come back like boomerangs
Beat the pussy up like a ole beat machine
Oop, there it is, bring a friend, tag team
Then I beat 'em up like the woofers in my vert
I give her Tylenol 'cause she say her jaws hurt
Need a chick like Trina, make her dreams come true
Baby when I cum, guarantee you cum too
And like big 6, the dick hypnotize minds
I put that on my mama baby if you think I'm lyin'

Bitches on deck, one for me and one for you
Just the way I like, straight A-Town
Meet me in the room, guarantee it go down
Yea, your baby daddy mad, you woulda spilled the beans
Don't get mad 'cause she on my drill team
I turn virgins into sex fiends
I turn nightmares into wet dreams
Make a jookbox wet, make her think she on her cycle
Hit her from the back, then I grab her by the micros
Make her touch her toes til her knees turn weak
Neighbors complain 'cause they say they can't sleep

[Bridge]

[Chorus: x2]

When it's time for round three, strap on another glove
T.K.O, now the hoe all in love
She love to call me Tyson when I nibble on her ear
I hit her wit a combo, now she call me Holyfield
I know it sound vulgar but that's the way she like it
Got the worlds biggest (shhh), don't matter, just don't bite it
No I'm not conceited but see I keep it trill
Playboys shout it, Mr Black and decradrill
Yea your girl say my name, please don't take offense
Have 'em bent like this, suckin' on some gangsta shit
I don't think it's worth it if you really want the truth
Cause at this phrase in time she givin' brain in the houpe

Got that Microsoft, so they call me Bill Gates
Ice links around my neck, lookin' like I build gates
I'm Mista Amoco, yea I got the pumps
Pockets on swoll, lookin' like they got the mumps
I'm 'bout my change, gotta get the riches
From the look of thangs ya'll gettin' J.C. pennies
Pass dat Patron, the limes' right der. Rock with it, lean with in my nik'er
Wink my eye at cha bitch, now wishing now she could touch
See the J's on my feet and she love the diamond cuts
Fresh to death, everyday, like I jumped up outta caskets
Ask Chino Dolla about that dope boi magic
Connected like apartments, keep one in the cartridge
Chevy seats ostrich, name in the carpet

[Chorus:]

I mix Patron and ever glow, I call it antifreeze
Take one sip a drop off to her knees
Mista V.I.P, get like me. Ice piece on white beat', I call it Iced-t
Cush by the seven's I call it Mike Vic. She call me officer I hit her with my nightstick
My swag so mean, anger management
You call it what you want, I'm on some mo' eleven shit
These niggas wanna hate, godammit we can handle it
Mad 'cause I got juice, call me Tropicana bitch
Joc feel good. Joc buy the bar. Catch me in the hood pimp, rollin' on a gar
I plead to the Judge, I'm guilty of the charge

You see the yellow ice, you holla , oh my God!
Tynna guess the price, 'bout thirty large

Er'body wanna know, how I do my thang?
Yea I get money and I let my nutts hang
Pull up to curb, cut it to the left
My rims sittin' tall 'til I a dim the knee-steps
I just see what I want, then I go get it.
The apple jelly Chevy with peanut butter in it
So don't get mad, pimp keep it cool
I hang with them goons and the boys keep them tools
I hustle all day, thas just how I live
Stackin' them big faces, give 'em strippers dolla bills
Check the dictionary for a P.I.M.P
When you look it up partna, tell me who ya see?
Young G, Young see, yea thas me
Twenty-eight G's, on my feet twenty-three's

[Chorus: x 2]
I'm choppin 24's
Blowin good dro
Yeah, I got plenty Hoes
Life ain't picture perfect
Yeah ya see the ice
And I dress nice
Make 'em look twice
Life ain't picture perfect

Yeah I'm blowin on some good lime
Skatin on two 85's
Wouldn't believe half the shit that's skatin through a niggas mind
745 complimented with leather and wood
Chickens on my dick 'cause a nigga fresh and smellin good
Jack boys plottin on my stacks on deck
Wanna put the Tec to my chest for the ice on my neck
Oh yeah it's easy to attain it all
Harder to maintain it all
If you want a perfect picture only god can paint it dog
Niggas in these videos with multi-platinum projects
Can't even get credit cards
And they Momma stay in projects
How is that? Scratch my head
Somethin don't seem right
Ya teeth full of ice
So when ya smile I seen lights
Seems like I'm hatin I'm just statin the facts
I ain't feelin' to smile in ya face and put a blade in your back
Now try not to get caught up on the way shit looks
'Cause everything ain't picture perfect, just listen to the hook

[Chorus: x 2]

Yeah I'm off in magic city
Trickin them ass and titties
Bitches blowin me kisses makin me wanna hit it
I must admit, got a good chick and she been holdin me down
But I ain't fuckin around 'cause there is too much shit goin around
Like the rims on my pickup
Scared to get my dick sucked
Nigga run into the clinic even from a hiccup
Pick up the pieces from the fuckin puzzle
I'm affiliated with niggas who murder, rob and hustle
Plus you think I'm ballin 'cause I'm poppin Crys and spendin G's
I'm just tryin to drink away the pain that killed my nigga steve
Nigga please, I ain't shit
Cookies and cream
Feelin like Marvin it make me wanna holla and scream

[Chorus: x 2]

Now half the shit ya doin already been done
And that's why half my niggas dead, locked up or on the run
That dope money ain't sufficient it don't last all ways
Niggas trap all night in project hallways
All day long niggas front like stars
On them big ass rims that most than they cars
Spent 300 on a outfit a hundred on some nikes
But his baby needs wopes, diapers and pedialite
And you prolly' got a cousin, brother or a friend
And this song sound like it from begging to end
Then again it might be me
And I'm tired of the nonsense
Can't sleep at night cause I got a guilty conscience

Yung Joc,"Now see, the definition of a real nigga
Is about it, in this motherfucking song right here
You know, it took two real niggaz to collab
And make some motherfucking shit happen, man
It's your boy Yung Joc, you know, Block Entertainment
And my motherfucking nigga Trae, asshole by nature
Ay, Trae, tell me what you is nigga

[Trae]
I'm a gangsta to the end, riding for the set
Black Chevrolet, with the paint still wet
J's on my toes, locs on my eyes
Crawling on fours, every time I slide by
Nothing less than the truth, on the streets of the South
Hos on my swag 'cause the diamonds in my mouth
But I move low key, posted in the trap
Raw with the rap, to put my hood on the map
I'm a do this one for H.A.W.K., and his brother named Pat
And my partna named Screw, so I let the trunk crack
What they know about that, haters better chill
Plus I'm packing something, that they classify steel
Repping my block, still doing my thang
Trunk full of bang, holding A.B.N. gang
Screwed up click, I'm a let the world know
Before it's all over, we gon' make the world slow

[Chorus]
You can find me in the hood, swanging in a drop
Trunk popped up, now I'm letting back the top
Locs on my face, and my grill so clean
Thirty grand talk, boppers hopping on my team
Moving so slow, banging my screw
Moving so slow, banging my screw
Moving so slow, banging my screw
Hop out on the block, still hollin' 'what it do'

[Yung Joc]
'65 Impala, Chevy SS
The top disappear, see the clear VVS
I guess you know the name, I ain't even gotta say it
When I say it's going down, SK start spraying
Block E-N-T, and A.B.N. niggaz in charge
Ery'body mugging, nigga face different starch
I'm a let you pull your card, but watch how quick I pull it
Ay fuck a semi-auto, my niggaz pack fullest
We bullies on the block, the hustle don't stop
It's eat what you kill, that's the motto off top
Yeah, it's the A-Town, and the H-Town
Tell 'em this the shake down, lay face down
Me and my nigga Trae, getting cake now
Split it down the middle, 50-50 that's the break down
Baby, keep your face down, and don't talk back
You can find me in the hood, nigga distributing packs

[Big Pokey]
My guns go off, when my fists is hard
Mobbed up 'cause nigga pistols'll scar
You got your knife on you, homie, that's for twisting cigars
I got my knife on me, homie, that's for twisting your guards
These niggaz, wanna play you for weak
It's going down, motherfuckers drizzown when they playing it deep
I do the damn thang, niggaz talking about it
I'm a problem run into it, you ain't walking up out it
Sensei'll fade the pack, I get mean
Lean on you with this beam, till you fade to black
Cuffing broads, cause I mack on chicks
I go hard same nigga hit your hard, put your Lac on bricks
Niggaz a trip, crock bull give niggaz the clip
Slap niggaz in they trap, when they giving me lip
S.U.C. my nigga, we missing H.A.W.K.
I'm gon' live through the rest of the click, that's real talk

[Chorus]

[Trae]
Hop out on the block, like I'm still hitting stangs
Platinum in the hood, so they tend to know my name
Yellow VS-1's, got me switching up the game
Might hop fly, top dropping like the rain
Hoes talk down, Trae never get mad
Niggaz old school, still jacking my swag'
Y'all concerned about a playa, since the day of my birth
Grab a couple mill, and I can show you what I'm worth
Sitting so low, every time I come down
Trunk just popped, so I'm showing my surround
84's got me tipping, so low to the ground
Still hitting licks, moving off the Greyhound
Watching for the laws, I ain't fucking with the time
Bitch I'm in my prime, ain't no stopping my shine
I advise, that they lead the truth to the throne
If you say I ain't the realest, say bitch you dead wrong

The money don't flip then the block ain't hot
If she don't scream your name then your game just shot

I got a couple reasons you can call me the boss
And I drop a couple stacks and watch your head get lost
The Joc a real catch shorty better believe that
If you ain't a ride or die bring them car keys back

Take your foot off the brake baby go?on ride out
If them sucka wanna hate put ?em in timeout
I get that cake and you'll soon find out
If you ever cross me you'll get crossed out

Couple more album before I retire
Most of these rappers ain't nuttin? but liars
Hollered by the killers when they sang in the choir

Straight from the bottom and I'm trying to get higher
Too many strikes, got too many priors
Messing with us like playing with fire
Get your wicks split time to meet your messiah

I seen it before ain't runnin? no more
It?s gonna catch up with me baby don't stop
Get to the floor, what you waitin? for?

Show me that you're sho? ?nuff ?bout it, bout it

Now I been walking up this road trying to find which way to go
Crying upon my face sometimes it seems like I don't know
Now I got a chance to touch where things beyond my reach
And the answer?s right in front of me

And now the haters hot, so they run and tell the cops
They shut us down, we set up shop on another block

We ain't got pretty bitches but we got plenty of these
All my niggas cut throat, gang bang and cut throat
Original bad boys man even Puff know
We ain't mad about Pac, we know who did it
We just mad that him and Big got crossed in none senses
I was 16 then, little nigga inspired
Now me and Joc ridin, homie put that on the wire
If hip hop was a building, I'd set it on fire
and leave everybody to burn except Mya (haha)
Nah, fuck you bitch, I rescue all my niggas first and let em' fuck you bitch
On the east coast, them niggas say I'm dumb-hot

Hey, nigga you don't want no static
Holes throw your chest, hard to breathe, like asthmatics
Just like Big, tell them niggas, kidnap your kids,
Fuck em in the ass and throw um over the bridge
When I'm on the east, I'm ballin' wit that Jimmy cat (ballin!)
Bad bitches everywhere, they all on my Jimmy sack
We blowin sour Ds, hundred fifty packs,
I fuck with real Gs, like the Diplomats
When I'm in cali, nigga we blow incense
Call my nigga Cavi, to smoke away my stress
The only coats you'll see locs and dickie suits or molguls
Chirp my nigga JTLo in the booths it's ova

Got a big dollar date somewhere back in the states

Now you don't have to like what I do
I'ma do me, and you do you
I say that you don't have to like the way I ride
I'm a G, and I gets mine

Yeah I can't lie man, I done seen amazing places
Amazing broads with amazing faces
Persuade them to do things, I make 'em taste it
Baby let's rinse off, we bathin naked
Time to change clothes, we Bathing Ape it
This lavish lifestyle, I can't escape it
Leave no paper trail, the feds can't trace it
Blow a couple hundred thou' around the world, let's make it

Now you don't have to like what I do
I'ma do me, and you do you
I say that you don't have to like the way I ride
I'm a G, and I gets mine

Yung Joc,"[Yung Joc:]
Ay you know what, eh-heh
When I started recordin this album
I said I wasn't gonna do a, y'know dear momma type of record but
I felt the need to cause ahhh I wanna express how I feel about my momma
But at the same time I wanted y'all to know that
if I ever found a woman out there that, was anything like my momma
SHIT~! I got to have her

[Chorus: Jazze Pha]
Ain't another girl on this earth, like my momma
But if I find that girl, I'ma make her my woman
If I find another girl, like my momma
I can go unconditional love 'til they take me under

[Yung Joc:]
Gyeah; first thing first, where do I start
This feeling that I'm feeling is real it's not a facade
The angel that I call momma was sent by God
Been through thick and thin, better times, even hard
Raisin two boys in the ghetto wasn't easy
Shit was goin wrong but she made it seem peachy
Yeah she worked long hours, whether rain and the freezin
Pulled out the Vicks vapor rub when I was sneezin
When the kid laid her off and the rent was past due
Mom was a O.G., did what she had to
I got kicked out of school, she had to talk to my principal
Yeah she kicked my ass, but her love is unconditional
I love my momma

[Chorus]

[Yung Joc:]
Yo, yo
I remember - my first BMX, she showed me how to ride
She used to lick her thumb to wipe the cold out my eyes
Oh yeah I can't forget her cookin how it stick to my ribs
She could take Spam and make a first class meal
When my nigga Steve, me and her both cried
And when I got locked up, she bailed me out every time
Guess I'll never know how she remained so strong
Received Medicaid and food stamps for so long
We was section 8 all the way 'til I was grown
She played both roles, king and queen of the throne
I'm not exaggeratin, not even to the slightest
This came from the heart, so I ain't even have to write it
I love my momma

[Chorus]

[Yung Joc:]
I'ma try to stop the music one time
Want y'all to clap with me, c'mon
Now if you love your momma clap yo' hands
If you love your momma clap yo' hands (aww yeah~!)
If you love your momma clap yo' hands
If you love your momma clap yo' hands (aww yeah~!)
Shorty, I brought you in this world, I'll take you out
You said it when you caught me skippin school, makin out
Momma you stayed down, you never faked it
Stayed by my side when they thought I wouldn't make it
And when I had a son, they said I need a job
That's when you told me son, just follow your heart
And so I did that, I went through all the drama
So I just wanna take this time to say I love you momma

Ya laughed about my dance, I walked it out the bank
Now my lady happy cause we ain't gotta starve
Hatas mad at me, cause I'm on my joc

Beat in my trunk bought it just for the freaks
Catch me in the hood posted at the sto

Pistol in my lap on the phone countin dough

Just like her mamaand I ain't sayin the name brain

Boys from the hood call me black Donald Trump
Dope boy magic seven days a week
Number one record long as nitty on the beat
Oh I thank they like me betta yet I know

Lights camera action when I walk through the door
Niggaz know my crew we certified stars
Ready in the front bout 35 cars

Have ya every seen a chevy wit the butterfly doors?

Gotta make sure ya see the buckets on my feet

Every time I see 'em look 'em in the eye

Now what would Diddy say if he caught you in my coupe
On the way uptown if the ball get loose
Tearin' through the blocks, tearin' of the tops
Sun all in your face and it's glarin' of my rocks
I had to ask her how she felt, said let's ride she ain't strap on a seatbelt
I stay fly, fitted cap with a mean belt thats the thug shit that's makin' her knees melt

Boy I trust you and all
But I've been here before you
You remind me of pain
But I can't ignore you

After I met you boy
I try my best not to
Think of you
Such a silly game to play
To eventually just lose to you

Can I get another chance to hold you tonight
Dance on my left and things feel so right
Hold you boy with all of my might
Just don't let you slip away
I pour my heart out to you from now to daylight
So you could know hurting you was never my right
I'm trying to see what's in the cards for tonight
Boy accept this as my plea

[Chorus]
I love you
I love you
I love you (Hey, hey)
So don't break my heart

I felt a weight lift from my chest
Now that you know just how I feel
I held it in for far to long
I couldn't tell if this was real

I never thought I'd understand
How it feels to be hurt and to love again (Oh, no, no)
You made it possible for me
That's why I'll give you anything

Can I get another chance to hold you tonight
Dance on my left and things feel so right
Hold you boy with all of my might
Just don't let you slip away
I pour my heart out to you from now to daylight
So you could know hurting you was never my right

You brought light to my life

Without you by my side
I was wasting my time
But now I love you
Just don't break my heart

Look, I think she love me (love me) I think she love me not(not)
Anywhere I touch her turn to a hot spot
Look into my eyes tell me what you see A grade A hustla, a certified G
Only one question, what attracted you to me the way I do me make you weak to your knees
Now Cheri you know a nigga can't wait to put my hands on that little cherry coke bottle shape
Like uh you said a nigga make ya heart jump like uh
You said a nigga give you goose bumps like uh
Send chills up and down ya spine uh

(Neva)
They hate me mo?
(So!)
Yeah I know
(Haha)

Here I go
(Yeah)
No matter what shawty, here I go
(Haha)
No matter what shawty

You let the blog sites and the magazines tell it
I'm sure to be in jail till 2027
Rather see me in a cell
Instead of this new McLaren
God'll take you through hell just to get you to heaven

So even though it?s heavy, the load I will carry
Grin and still bear it
Win and still share it
Apologies to the fans, I hope you can understand it
Life can change ya directions
Even when you ain't planned it

All you can do is handle it
The worst thing you could do is panic
Use it to your advantage
Avoid insanity, manage to conquer
Every obstacle, make impossible possible
Even when winning's illogical
Losing's still far from optional

Yeah they wanna see you shot up in the hospital
But when life throw punches, block ya counter like a boxer do
Been locked inside mi casa too long
I did a song to make it known that the king lives on, pimpin?

I ain't dead
(Naw)
I ain't done
(Naw)
I ain't scared
(Of what?)
I ain't run
(From who?)

But still I stand
(Yeah)
No matter what people
Here I am
(Yeah)
No matter what, remember

I ain't break
(Neva)
I ain't fold
(Neva)
They hate me mo?
(So)
Yeah I know
(Haha)

Here I go
(Yeah)
No matter what, shawty here I go
(Haha)
No matter what shawty

Even in solitude, there's still no hotter dude
I show you how to do what you do
You ain't got a clue
All you do is follow dudes
Sound like a lot of dudes
I weather whateva storm
Make it out without a bruise

I understand why, now wit my hands tied
Dey take shots cause if I'm out there it?s a landslide
But revenge is best served as a cold dish
And suckas will get served nigga, no shit

Guess it was understood, for me it was over with
But I don't quit if ya ain't notice yet
They couldn't wait to say good night shawty
So they can try to rhyme, act and look like shawty

Go get a beat from Toomp and make a hook like shawty
Before ya know it I'm back, what it look like shawty?
I lost my partna and my daughter in the same year
Somehow I rise above my problems and remain here

Yeah and I hope the picture painted clear
If ya heart filled with faith then ya can't fear
Wonder how I face years and I'm still chillin??
Easy, let go and let God deal wit it

I ain't dead
(Naw)
I ain't done
(Naw)
I ain't scared
(Of what?)
I ain't run
(From who?)

But still I stand
(Yeah)
No matter what people
Here I am
(Yeah)
No matter what, remember

I ain't break

I ain't fold

But no one tells me which way to go
I'm caught up in a world
Elaborath a maze
Where yes men could easily be known
I ask them no questions
They give me no answers
Following the wise
But they're walking in pampers
Give me a cigarette
Smoking my cancer
Drink the pain away
But I still have no answers

Don't know which way to go
I'm losing my mind
Losing control of the wheel
And I'm swerving
On and off the road

But survival is a must
Don't know who I can trust
I'm living in a rush
I don't understand the fuss
My brain is bout to bust

I think I'm losing it
I might be losing it
I just might lose
Am I losing my mind?
And I'm so confused I don't know what to do
And I need a clue before I run out of time
Am I losing it?

Am I losing it?

Lipstick on them rims got them rims blowing kisses (kisses)

Twenty rubber bands you could get your self a pigeon (pigeon)
Bring another ban get yourself a pound a midget (midget)
They know what it is
Y'all know what it is
He know what is is
She know what it is

On them 26s shirts on a 71 chevel
Like I'm riding carousel shorty I cant parallel,
They say shawty give em hell
Shorty I'ma give em hell,
Quarter milly worth her jewelry
Like that boy cant even care
Bout no money bout no hoe bout no car
Bout no clothe boy u better hold your nose
Cause im shitting on your nose
Keeps a Louie bag for what?
Bitch I been had swag, I got 50 thou'
Cash in a brown Kroger bag.

Lipstick on them rims got them rims blowing kisses (kisses)

Bring another ban get yourself a pound a midget (midget)

My chain is worth a mansion and my wrist is worth a lambo
But I'm living in a mansion and I'm riding in a lambo
Bunch a gangstas like sopranos white keys like pianos
And I'm looking for a bitch that wants to join me in a porno
Hello darling how ya doing that's yo man you need to lose him
He ain't doing what I'm doing my doors tall Patrick Ewing
Urkel purple pass the cushion straight from Oakland
It just flew in if I bust the package open you would think I started brewing

Every bitch in here a model saying balling is my motto
That's the truth and you can swallow
What I said or take a hollow me I'm in that monte carlo
Zoe up in that murcielago
Lamborghini got these breezies tripping fiending
That they need me jus to see me or be wit me in
They vicky c bikini but I really ain't that needy
If you wanna kick it wit me grab that kush
And one them breezies pour a glass of that martini

And we were talking about how we tend to base our self-esteem
On what other people think
And that's not really self-esteem
Self-esteem is 'sposed to be about how we feel about ourselves
And I was just saying how dangerous it is to
Allow other people determine how you're gonna feel about you
And it's kinda like looking into a broken mirror
You gotta look in a broken mirror and change your face

These cats ain't balling, they telling stories
But ain't gotta worry, bout H.S.E.
If I ain't hating on you, then why you hating on me

We from the deep down South in the city
In the light, and I be seeing these girls be looking pretty
That's why, I got to stay on my grind
So we can be a hundred percent, all the time
Y'all don't know where we from (where we from)
Y'all don't know where we been (where we been)

Its like one for the money, and two is for them hoes
Three is for the drank, Four pass me the smoke
You won't see me riding, in any ole Benz
Unless its jet black, on twenty inch rims
I got more Air Force, than the government
Every color pair, I'm so fly trust me I'm loving it
I never leave the hoe, with just a single rubber
And I crawl like Ringling Brothers, hoes love us
Under the in-fluence, catch me swerving
Playing in a number six, like Julius Irving
My watch and my chain, got me coughing and sneezing
Still a young heathen, as long as I'm breathing
I pay for a show, turn it out then I'm leaving
The way the man told us, its flossing season
This year we got it made, we shining y'all
Even though we got a due, we still grinding y'all

Who am I, name is Lil' Flip
And I roll with, two clips
Just in case, something happen
While y'all niggas yapping, I'ma be capping
Rolling with my strap and, pistol packing
Glock 9's, Tech 9's, even a Mack 10
I'm not acting, I pack clips so
Play your roll, and stick to the script
Before I flip, and empty the clip
I'm Gladys Night, cause I'm a pimp
We eating shrimp, and catching planes
You know I'm great, at catching dames
And what's your name, where you live
Will you give some brain, do you got kids
Cause if you do girl, its okay
So pass the syrup, fuck the courvassier",Deep Down South,2003

Do you go half, with your nigga on some killa
Do you bang Screw, Fat Pat, Mike D
You know how we do it, we the S.U.C.

From Redd's showroom ya heard me (off top)
We still balling, we still doing this shit ya heard me
We still in it (believe that) it's that flame shit

The wheels on my truck, go round and round
I'm sitting 24 inches, off of the ground
How that sound, mama said o what you'd like
Hold it rocking flights, red, white and blue stripes
But hold up, down South still on nonstop
Cause we been representing down here, for a while
With no solo album, I was still amazing
Stayed full of them trees, I was purple hazing
Look at me now, Redd ain't playing around
Two skinny, but my stacks keep weighing me down
They say balling is a habit no, I can't help it
Now I got more green, than a Boston Celtic
So I'm going all out, on a money route
Now I think these niggas, really know what I'm about
I don't know where you been, I don't know where you from
But around these parts, we get it how it come

See I'm a flosser, balling like you see it
Recognize me as a balla, legend in the streets
Best believe I did it all but, that will never stop me
From feeling like a flosser, cause I'm a balla

I'm still in the game, why'all catch my drift
I got that work cheap dog, peep my flip
When I hop out the truck, why'all catch my drift
The rolly's so icy, bitch get off my dick
We ride the finest cars, you know we stay stunting
Rims so big on the six, they sit funny
If it ain't broke don't fix it, blunt it and blist it
In a all blue something, with the plates unlisted
Like Nike, keeping you bitch niggas in check
Yeah whodi you know me, they boy is back
With two bricks, two chicks and two platinum Macks
I stay grinding, so you know I stay shining

See I'm like a value meal, my doe supersized
Copping a brand new Bentley, Coupe to ride
With mo' cake than a bakery, we got cream
Candy truck radio up, like Raheim
7-1-3 nigga, that's the name of my team
We still get full of that syrup, and gangsta lean
I still be ghetto fab, if I drove a yellow cab
Yung Redd enough said, my niggas got cash
Don't get it twisted up, my wrist lit up
You gotta show me something, for me to get up
Just call me a rough neck, but I cash enough checks
To put me in a Vet, and roll off with a set
The streets give me respect, for everything that I did
As a kid I always kept a strap, close to my ribs
But I don't know where you been, and I don't know where you from

Yeah, take a look into my backyard
Where there ain't no way out, and niggas want to act hard
Watch your friends, some turn to fakers
That's why I smoke green acres
Get your paper, look around the world is violent
I, do my dirt and move in silence
Come on, you seen them capture, heard them sirens
Just come outside, boys are fighting
Yet the, grass is green, mosquitoes biting
So I grabbed a pencil, and started writing
About the the shit we seen, the shit we did
And how we live, just growing up as a kid
Down in Houston Texas, its hot as hell
I know its hard to gain, easy to fail
Now days, anything might send you to jail
Take note, this is show and tell, in my backyard

[Chorus]
Oh I never thought, that it would be this way
Living in the ghetto
Who would of thought that I could make a change
All I ever wanted, was to make it out this game
Living in the ghetto
I kept on trying until I found my way, my way

[Yung Redd]
From the porch to the street, from the street to the sto'
From the sto' to the corner, where a nigga sold dope
Put it together, this left niggas with no hope
But it seemed to twerk the block, work or stay broke
Oh no, back then money was slow
Wasn't cool to be bold, believe it I know
Wasn't no field of dreams, couldn't get no sleep
When cops popped the pistols, in the street
Now let's see, the ghetto's been shooting at me
Tell me to freeze, before I can stash my cheese
Some of us get caught, some make it out
Day in and day out, on a paper route

[Chorus]

[Yung Redd]
Waking up with the roosters, can't do what I use to
Like wasting time, fucking with losers
This is what goes on, way down here
Tell it like it is, we stay round here
All my niggas, get paid round here
Sometimes, people get sprayed round here
Hey, days and nights, nights and days
I use to dream of ways, to get paid
So now I'm, looking around to see what's shaking
Opportunity knocked, but my spot was vacant
Boys on the country, locked up for hustling
Game over, we just got time for nothing
You might see niggas yelling, always fussing
Around the way, this what happens everyday
So just put up your guards, times is hard
Live from the backyard, from the backyard

That's a set back, you know I'm saying man
Lil' Red, way back in the motherfucking cut man
Nigga was like shit nigga, I was like what come on man

[Scarface]
Street lights are glowing, everyday's another struggle
And moving slowly in silence, steady making sho' my hustle
Is air tight, these city streets is hectic gotta get it here
Tomorrow ain't a promise to me, so I don't live in fear
I work until I touch it, stack it until I need it
I spend it on what I want, re-up and that's when I bleed it
The soldier could never see me, as being some'ing that's lesser
A nigga straight out the gutter, murdered without a question
Product of my surroundings, click it clack it and and down him
All they know is he missing, but niggaz ain't never found him
I'm sorry but still in yet, I don't live it on regrets
I'm a motherfucking killer, for realer this ain't a threat
I'm as gangsta as it gets, and my advice to you is live your life
And never when niggaz might, hit you under city lights
So get it right (never know)
You never know when niggaz might, hit you under city lights get it right

[Hook - 2x]
Lord forgive me, cause I know I ain't living right
Still I gotta make some'ing happen, under them street lights
But pay attention, let me show you what my life like
You can get your days cut short, under them street lights

[Yung Redd]
Them folks got me under the scope, cause I ain't living right
Still I ain't the one to provoke, dog you get it right
20 inch shoes when I cruise, under them city lights
Careful with the road I choose, cause you can lose your life
I'm praying and hoping, I never get caught in the moment
Shot from a glock, that's smoking from not scoping
When a nigga told me, you don't work you don't eat
So I'm slanging thangs for cheap, where the streets lights meet
And my pop, was a rolling stone
15 I was grown, 16 I was holding my own
Is it wrong to sell you a dream, or sell you a zone
A long way from home, on this road I roam
Still I'm po'ing the liquor, for niggaz who ain't with us
Ery'body ain't a gangsta, every nigga ain't a killa
Naw but them laws, couldn't tell ya the difference
So pay attention, or find yourself locked in prison this ain't living man

Years have passed, and shit in the hood getting drastic
Two days ago, my homegirl got blasted
That's tragic, happened right on my block
I'm feeling paranoid, laws might run in my spot
So I'm living low key, and them folks don't know me
Slowly I ride through the city, stack mo' cheese
Then I slide out, to the hideout and smoke on
Haters watching, my chest is froze like a snow-cone
But hold on, trash talking ain't my game
Rather pimp me a dame, or switch lanes in a Range
Peep this it ain't a secret, them laws ain't right
They like to catch a late night, living the life
That's why I'm on top of my game, always thinking twice
Don't get it twisted, I still got a mean right
But most of the time, my nigga I'm on chill

I got some partnas in the cage, I be shootin' them kites, them other
Guys is all hype, tell them suckas take a hike baby, you see them
? you see them hundred spokes, I'm holdin' spokes just wood
Deep, ya get it, coast to coast, I'm slabbin' candy drops, punchin' clocks
And slammin' broads, I got money like Reggie Bush, my billboard got a lotta
Yards, I'm with that Poppa Joe, I got dro on da low, I keep the lean for a month
Or so, but I'm back on it, I can't let go, I'm down with T.Farris and G.Dat, we

Uh
The streets of my city be gritty
Young niggaz pack plenty, and ain't never show no pity
Many die on streets of concrete, blasted from the heat
From under the seat, niggaz just tryin' to make ends meat
Trying to eat, day to day livin' with no religion
Luxury cars, and this money got my full attention
School teachers and the preachers don't know what to teach us
They don't get a second look without them ghetto features
Created so the non pigmentated rated
Pornographic caught they children learn the words and say it
Save the monsters, but don't nobody know the lord
Status depends on the baddest shit you can afford
And look at me I'm in the middle of the confusion
Crime in my blood and I need a transfusion
Take it how you want to take it
I gotta twist and break it
Make it shine to distinguish from the ones who fake it
and if it comes out raw, and uncontrollable
Money's foldable, fuck a hip-hop quoteable
Nobody felt what I was feeling when I wrote this shit
Broke this shit, but that ain't new so I can cope with this
Hope it get better for those who don't get a chance
To advance, and dig the shit I be saying
You know what might make what I say a little clearer
If mothafuckers judge the one they see in the mirror

But ima be right by your side
Even when that road get rough
I keep it cool when the streetz iz hott
And all your friends that soon forgot
They leavin you all alone to rott
But I'll be there till you back on top
I'm down wit ya wit no strings
No matter what, one hundred I'm willin to feed
I'm gettin that paper to feed my krew
And no matter what you goin through
I'm stayin true...

(Chorus)
(Z-Ro)
I know you been searchin for someone
To keep it one hundred
So tired of mixed love and bullshit
And keep keepin it comin
Damn right he came up from nothin
But now he's got money
And he's feedin his people
And now ain't one of 'em gon' ever go hungry

(Z-ro 2nd Verse)
Uhh...
I represent Mo' City until the day I die
I speak the truth even when I say a lie
Even lil babys know better than to play with I
Would be to lost and never found to say bye bye
Ya'll already know I got a lot of evil in me
But I got a lot of that love shit too
'cause I promise I'm in love with my ride
And I'm in love with what its sittin on
Bitch and my paints so blue
Thanks to Paul Wall
You already know I got love for ya bro
My cup empty yo cup
If you less pour some mo
My nigga T-faris and J-dawg
And even my old school nigga Fuck
When they show us hate
We gon' show 'em back love
Now but last year would've been a different scene
But ima let you make it 
'cause I'm really tryna keep it one hundred
So stay the fuck away from me please!

(Chorus)
I know you been searchin for someone
To keep it one hundred
So tired of mixed love and bullshit
And keep keepin it comin
Damn right he came up from nothin
But now he's got money
And he's feedin his people
And now ain't one of 'em gon' ever go hungry

(Yung Redd Verse 3)
Homie I'm different like a alien
Driven in that mothership
Its black its midnight
I'm sittin high up on that numbers list
Went from all this paper rain but now I'm never drowsy
They talk but I can't even hear the way 
They wisper 'bout me
Even if they doubt me haters I'm off limits
Blowin cake
Ohh yea I make desert for a livin
So many times I swear I spare my last one hundred
Like a grade in the class
Now that's extra credit

(Chorus)
I know you been searchin for someone
To keep it one hundred
So tired of mixed love and bullshit
And keep keepin it comin
Damn right he came up from nothin
But now he's got money
And he's feedin his people
And now ain't one of 'em gon' ever go hungry

Yung Redd,"Slim thugga, muthafucka!

Now welcome to the city of game, piece of chains and swangs
Pop, trunk and bang, yeah I'm still here mayne
Born and raised on the stead block, braids no dreadlocks
Married to the hood, me and Scenic Woods wedlock
Acres Homes my home, I'm a Northside veteran
Repping H-Town, smoking, sipping on some medicine
Ain't nobody better than the boss when I floss
It's Slim Thugga motherfucker, still breaking boys off

Got plenty cheese plenty carats man we looking like some caterers
And it's looking like you haters and you fakes is imitating us
Shaded up, braided up, and I bet that truck be bladed up
Bentley still crawling on fo's so they ain't fading us
In the hood I'm a grinder, wood on the vinyl
TV, VCR, I'm laid back with your mama
You ain't never seen a grinder that grind the way I grind, huh?
Top of my drop still missin' as Osama

(Still breaking boys off, hmm) Candy painted with the gloss
You can hate but that's the way a player floss
(Still breaking boys off, hmm) Getting money's what I'm 'bout
I'ma get it while these haters just talk
(Still breaking boys off, hmm) Gotta do it for the north
Gotta do it for my hustlers in the south
(Still breaking boys off, boys off, still breaking boys off)
And when I do it I'ma do it like a boss (still breaking boys off)

I still represent H-Town, the city of that candy
They see me with a lotta cars but they don't understand it
They say the never seen ya boy out here gettin' his grind on
Phantom, Bentley, take ya pick, yeah I'm gettin' my shine on
I've sold 2 million records now my paper all swole now
The mayor of the city, top down when I roll now
H-town, home of the candy paint
Home of the 84's and vogues and the purple drank

Yeh this the city that's slow, the city that's thowed
The city where the boys flip the candy painted low
The city where they blow big killa and stayed blowed
Hustling ass D-boys got the game sewed
Where they sip that paint (sip that paint) and drip that paint (drip that paint)
And drop that top (drop that top) and grip that grain (hold up)
6-10, I-10, 59, 45, and da belt
This Clutch City but we play what we dealt, reppin' the H-Town

(Still breaking boys off, hmm) Candy painted with the gloss
You can hate but that's the way a player floss
(Still breaking boys off, hmm) Getting money's what I'm 'bout
I'ma get it while these haters just talk
(Still breaking boys off, hmm) Gotta do it for the north
Gotta do it for my hustlers in the south
(Still breaking boys off, boys off, still breaking boys off)
And when I do it I'ma do it like a boss (still breaking boys off)

Hustle town's my home, it's where I do my dirt
Where the gangtstas smoke water with drank stains on they shirt
We ride swangin', chops blades just to break boys off
From South Park to the Southwest and all the way to that north
I'm talking Tidwell and Carverdale and Greenspoint too
From Denver Harbor to West Airport and all the way to Channelview
We steady bangin on this screw, it's chopping like kung fu
Hit me on the 8-3-2, it's Paul Wall, what it do baby (heheh, nahmtawkinbout?)

Know I'm talkin', my purple so muddy I can barely even drive
Blowin' down trees like a Category 5
Southside of H-Town the heart of Sunny Side
I could walk these streets if I was blind, nahmtawkinbout?
Yung Redd, take ya out the future
Stars imitate swear to God I was a jewler
Robert Davis, Fat Pat, this for you
To my homie Big Hawk, I salute, mayne

(Still breaking boys off, hmm) Candy painted with the gloss
You can hate but that's the way a player floss
(Still breaking boys off, hmm) Getting money's what I'm 'bout
I'ma get it while these haters just talk
(Still breaking boys off, hmm) Gotta do it for the north
Gotta do it for my hustlers in the south
(Still breaking boys off, boys off, still breaking boys off)
And when I do it I'ma do it like a boss (still breaking boys off)

H-O to the U-S, T-O to the N
God blessed me with the million dollar pen
See them quiet money gangstas with they hand in the air
That Sunny Side and South Park, I was raised out there
This is H-Town (H-Town), screwed up and slowed down
It's all love homie, keep rollin' up the whole pound
Pull up in the monster just look at him hidin'
Don Ke' heart of the south, slab ridin'

H-O-U-S-T-O-N, T-E-X-A-S
We go get it and come back with it until we take our last breath
From the city where our stadiums drop the top
Z-Ro the Crooked, my ghetto pass is good in any hood, any block they got
The white cup is for the codeine and the cigarillo is for the kush
If you want it we got it 'cause there's not a product we don't push
We used to be the dirty south, now we so dirty we filthy
So homie you must be touching it wrong if you don't feel me (you don't feel me)

(Still breaking boys off, hmm) Candy painted with the gloss
You can hate but that's the way a player floss

Gotta do it for my hustlers in the south

And when I do it I'ma do it like a boss (still breaking boys off)

Welcome to H-Town, this 3rd Ward talking
Coming down the slab line the fo's crip walking
Together we stand, divided we fall, yeah
North and the south together we ball
Fuck that, nigga it's a H-Town thang
Lemme see ya touch the sky if ya feeling me mayne
It's Boss Hogg Corleone, nigga that Mike D
The drank man daddy, you know where to find me

State to state dawg, I got 'em jockin' the kid
6' backin out the driveway, dropping the wig
Y'all know we do it big, like a freightliner rig
Got stashes full of cash where I keep the money hid
Fresh to death homie, how I came in the do'
Prada shades on, smelling like a swanger of dro
Put'cha H'es up, represent'cha city bro
Counting money, iced out, like I'm in a video

(Southwest put'cha dubs up baby, let's go!)
And when I do it I'ma do it like a boss (still breaking boys off)

Now welcome to the place I love, place I was raised to be a G
It's straight hang with thugs, jam my music slow and hold my H's up

I go to school early, baby blue Moon jersey
Riding around, southwest side of my towm

Its from Sharpstown, Braeswood to Alief
Black and Latins stacking paper together we stay deep

King of the Streets and I'm roll around Houston ridin' 4's
Boys better chill 'fore this throw-away leave they curtains closed (lights out)
I'm in the slab but I'm tippin' it like a platinum Rolls
Suicide make the doors presidential when they decide to close (real talk)
They want the throne but tell the haters that I got it locked (got it locked)
I shoot 'em on the west so whatever all they way to the block (doors up)
I'm so hood it be the true definition of me
Ain't no way speak about the H, without mentioning me, Tha Truth, nigga!

At the club, they lock off V.I.P. for me
And send bottle after bottle to my section for free

Just how much you can achieve 
So all you gotta do is dream 
I got the pressure on my back but I can hold it 
'Cause I been workin' hard in preparation for this moment 
I think it's kinda crazy I'm Becoming Legendary 
Now all these legends are becoming my opponent 
The thrown is for the takin' 
So watch me renovate-in this game 
I sit down wit my crown and contemplate my reign 
My only hope when I'm dead and gone 
Will the world remember my name 
Will my music live long 
My picture hang in the hall of fame 
Then I can't complain 
They tried to tell me what I couldn't be

Just be sure you n****s mention-my name

It's a sin if you don't listen

Yung Stet,"One time for all my n****s from a small city 
Wit big dreams to get up out 
I'm livin' proof that it's possible to make it 
Dedication and ambition's what it's bout 
F**k a hater if they doubt, it's my time 
They can't see me, but they feel me 
Like I'm rappin' for the blind 
Every line I spit 
Every verse I kick 
I only hope it's inspiration to that project kid 
Or that suburb dude 
That's still in school 
Keep ya education 1st and don't be no fool 
I'm speakin' from experience 
I hope they hearin' this 
God gives you the cards 
So now I'm dealin' with 
A full hand, as a man it's my plan 
To use my words for wisdom 
Keep a kid up outta prison 
Or, focused on a vision 
The world is like a trap 
But I'm way too smart 
I could never fall for that 

See you can run to hell and back 
But I ain't goin' witcha 
I've seen too many fall hard 
'Cause they ain't peep the picture 
Don't ask that man that's free 
'Cause he still got his future 
Ask that man with life if he regrets being the shooter 
You hearin' what I'm sayin'
Close yo mouth and pay attention 
You don't wanna be the person 
That they said, you shoulda listened 
Don't worry bout em hatin' 
You use that as motivation 
Tryna set a good example 
Let me be yo inspiration 

Inspire to succeed 
I give em what they need 
I paint a perfect picture so these children get to see 
That practice makes perfect 
Never give up on ya dreams 
Give it all you got and keep God on ya team 
I'm familiar wit the struggle 
In and outta trouble 
But I focused on the hustle 
While still remainin' humble 
On this road to success 
You meet a lot of hatas 
They never see me sweat 
'Cause I'm too busy countin' paper 
Never under estimate the power of the mind 
Never under estimate a kid that wanna shine 
This is for my n****s that are steady losin' hope 
In the prisons doin' time 
Or in the streets dealin' dope 
This is for my women raisin kids without a man 
Workin' 2 jobs doin' everything they can 
I promise you can make it 
Never give up on the fight 
Keep ya eyes on the prize and everything gon' be iight
Iight

Until they realize, bullets gon' follow the stitches

And in the eve no doubt, she was blowin my mind

I'm from the A-town, put 'em through a GA course
'Cause ""it's all in the game"" like EA Sports
From scams and money grams, there's unions that want to wire me

Callin' all cars, callin' all cars, back up, back up, back up(gotta problem)
Time and time again, I try to be on the good foot
But ladies don't be given me good looks
It's hard when you livin' like us
I started the good book
It's just what I see that got me shook
Mean mugs and cold stance take a nigga down
And to make him fail, I'mma take it to you how
Lights out, closed casket, murder warn
Young one come through with the under grudge
And live the life, don't talk about it
Don't make beef, come walk about it
Everybody know my name because I play in the street
Not because I say I'm street, mutha fucker

All my niggas is dirty, niggas is dirty
All my niggas is thirsy, thirsty thirsty
Now I don't give a fuck, if ya'll don't give a fuck
All my niggas is dirty, niggas is dirty

Well I don't give a fuck if ya'll don't give a fuck

Ya'll trying to sound like pop
I dunno w hy though
Sounded like pop is a position you shouldn't try for
They don't understand why they die for
And tell lies about black folk, and take from they own folk
That type of shit heavy poppin' through the stove
'Cause you don't want to show your face
'Cause its a known place
And I don't love her face when she take from me man
And I don't give a fuck what you think of me
'Cause what you think of me is nothin' but a mere decision
And they shipped my ass off ta prison
If I die than death is a given
And if I live let me enjoy living
That's a wonderful feeling

[Chorus: x2]

As a kid I had no life for life
Everything I do they say it wasn't right
Doesn't matter huslters scatter
Everyday from 12 in the A-T-L
So love is like the wind blowing cold off the scale
Tell me what's going on
Two wrongs don't make a right
But I know two holes in your dome with take your life
I'm on the precious shorty
They coming after what I treasure
Its time we start renting out yachts
Young wun yacht masters ship out blocks
Hold my block why'll I hand out glocks
Send the niggas over the hill
When they done, go pop somebody for sho

Out of his hands from a ban from alcohol
Fundamental narcissistic

When they wrote on the what
When they wrote on the

And lighting it up like a piece of art
They kicked him to the side and left him to starve
On the memory that's re-breaking his broken heart

Bout to knock my trunk off, with this shit down South
Knocking pictures off your wall, when I pass by your house
Know your spouse is your trojan, if you love her than get her
'Cause she stuck on a G, like a god damn sweater
Hotter than a baretta, trying to give it up fast
Left her stupid like cupid, and put a plug in her ass

Picking splinters out my palm mayn, gripping on wood

Hear them niggaz bumping, but they can't forget
Swanging down bumping tip, champagne under the tent
Trend setter, red beam for plexing
Crawling, living the life of a Texan
Get down your block three in the morning, waking the hood up
Crawling purple passion, up in my cup
I-10 to seventy one, mash the gas to Austin
Chrome glossing, big bossing flossing
Block to block spot to spot, no need for tripping
Still collecting my ends, in the 2K dimension
Twist a leaf out the leaf, as I crawl through the street
Waiting on the sunrise, praying a G on deep
It's a Sunday a fun day, and I crawl down Sunnydale
Sparkling sun rays, making the game prevail
Jazzy broads whispering, boppers shaking they tail
You can do what you do, I'm all about my mail

She gon stare G, so you better get her
I'm coming down, and I'm banging the hardest pit of the litter
Down south, keep our name out your mouth
And we'll get it on, and we known to buy a house
And buy the block it don't stop, with shoes and socks
Bet the top drop, and let the bumper unlock
But me I'm rolling foreign, never ever alone
Swanging left and right, with alarm cats knowing
Paints I be pouring, and you know I'm so wet
Getting me a ticket from the laws, you want to bet
They can't stand me, pulling off they say you dripping too much candy
Yes I can't stand it, I'm the drank and drip bandit
You can't handle it, bought the ice that sunk the Titanic
Don't panic, when you see me riding with Janet
On the escapade, riding a Escalade
Break these boys off with techs, my chest plate

Showstoppin' dead end, pimp the pen once again
Peep the message I send
Take these levels that you devils can't comprehend
Big body Benz, as I floss through the south
Big blue lens, now whatcha' talkin' about?
Close yo' mouth, as I settle all scores
Scream and shout, my similes and metaphors
Mansion doors, I constantly close
All you hoes, go and take off your clothes
Lord knows, ain't no time to play

Driving in my car
Listening to the radio
Baby when things got hard
You just let love go
I see the sunshine in the sky
Feel the rainfall down on my face
But it doesn't mean a thing
When we don't sing the same melody
As I listen to the radio


[Verse 1:]

Top down Volume up
And it's way past 10
I'm in the traffic reminiscing
About way back when
We used to live check to check
Everyday we was so broke
The only thing we had between us
Was our love and some hope
I was the man that made you laugh
And that cat the made you cry
You were the star that had my back
And the dime on my side
You never ever tried to change me
You'd just let me be me
Never got on me bout my business
You just let me be free
Gave me the space so I could breathe
Took care of my every need
In return I gave you everything
And made you my queen
We had the strongest of ties
Nothing could ever separate us
Took vows before God
And Honey Mooned out in Vegas
And You stood by me when the fam died
And held me close
But I guess nothing is forever
Now you want to let go
And I don't understand it
Fact I can barely believe it
I keep it pushing through the traffic
Still don't know why your leaving

When we don't sing the same melody
As I listen to the radio

[Verse 2:]

I think I at least deserve and explanation
Why your leaving
I could see if I was cheating
But that can't be the reason
I'm not believing how it changed
We was happy with nothing
Now we unhappy with something
Baby what happened to the loving
Miss the kissing and hugging
Wannna play with my kids
I'm on the road making this money
Trying to handle our biz
I put the fam first and foremost
Only second to God
Now you packing up and leaving
Said the distance is hard
But any woman in they right mind
Would love this man
I went out of my way
And held it down for the fam
I only wish you could just take a minute
Notice the way that we did it
While most just talk it we done lived it
How can you forget it
And I'mma spit it till my lungs collapse
I know the truth is that it's over
And you ain't coming back
So let me put this on record
I wrote these licks from my soul
I know that nothing lasts forever
But it's sad to see you go

You just let love go

When we don't sing the same melody
As I listen to the radio

[Verse 3:]

There's an old expression
If you love them let them go
If they come back its true love
But you can never be sure
So I'mma man up and stand up
I guess I got to let her leave
I mean it's hard on my heart
To watch her walk away from me
I know we had some bad times
But I never would have expected
The money would come along
And leave us stressed out and tested
And I invested every piece of me
In someone that believed in me
And now she leaving me
I guess it wasn't meant to be
And I'd be lying if I said it didn't hurt
But I'm a man I chalk it up
And I'mma take it for what it's worth
She pushed me to get it
And when I got it she left me
So I'mma give it to my kids
And keep on riding this Bentley
And evidently she confused
Thought the money d make her happy
But the money made us changed
And it effected us badly
I would have gladly quit it all
If she just would have asked me
And gave up the music
To make it right with my family

Yuri,"No sabes como se llama 
No sabes de donde viene 
Pero tiene mucha marcha

Y déjate conquistar 
Cuidao que no se te suba 
No te vaya a emborrachar 

Acércate despacito 
Y tócame la maraca 
Como suena despacito

Yuri,"Cosas del amor
El tiempo se paró
Cuando dijiste adiós

Un golpe al corazón
Un cuento que acabó
En la desilusión
Y aún te quiero

Quien me tiende hoy la mano
No puedo evitarlo
Me siento morir

Cosas del amor
El tiempo se paró
Cuando dijiste adiós
Te quiero

Cuento de nunca acabar
Es el amor
Que te seduce y sonríe
Y luego te hace llorar
Cuento de nunca acabar
Es el amor
Que ha de llegar por sorpresa
Y así también partirá

Y hoy ya no sé quién soy

Yuri,"Él llegó y sentó en en el bar 
Vi mi destino cambiar 
Las palabras, porque palabras 
Si solo basta mirar 

Comprender intenta comprender 
Fue con tu amor que soñé 
Lo que vale puede estar cerca 
Es tan sencillo de entender 

Cuantas veces yo pensé 
Solo entregarme al el amor que yo soñé 
La razón de tanta timidez fue natural oh 
Despertar del sueño a la realidad oh

Y no se decir si ya eres mío 
Como siento oh 
Por favor solo hazme una señal 

Un romance puede acontecer 
Al tropezar sin querer 
A tu lado sueño despierta 
Y no necesito mas saber 

Cuantas veces yo pensé 
Solo entregarme al amor que yo soñé 
La razón de tanta timidez fue natural oh 
Despertar del suelo a la realidad oh 

Y no se decir si ya eres mío como siento 
Cuantas veces yo te imagine oh 
Cuanto tiempo tendré que esperar 
Es un sueño o puede ser realidad

Yuri,"Todo fue cuestión de una mirada 
Y así surgió 
Todo fue cuestión de una sonrisa una atracción

Se siente en el roce si bailamos 
Se me enloquecen los átomos 
Se desintegran mis venas y siento 

(Química perfecta) 
Cuando mis labios te besan

Reacción en cadena

Fue cuestión de una mirada 
Fue cuestión de una sonrisa

Y sucedió 
Somos tal para cual 

Hoy nuestros labios se besan 
Y desvestimos el alma 
No hay razón para perder la calma 
Ni apresurar la entrega

Es inútil ya tratar de comprendernos

Debes entender que nos hacemos daño

Hasta el filo del amanecer

Hierve a partir de las diez  
 
Oiga que lo que dice la historia
Que desde aquí hasta la gloria

Ni el mas leve segundo que me das 
Todo el oro del mundo no, te cambio, no 

Imposible amarte como te amo yo

Se que se puede perder 
Mucho mas que la piel

Hay que preparar bien la ocasión

Escriba que lo nuestro esta prohibido

Si me gusta el fútbol y los bomberos 
Si duermo poco y fumo un puro nero

Date vuelta reloj de arena 
Que comience la cuenta atrás 
Que pasará

Casi medio cristalizados

De ser en tu cama una tercera almohada
De ver que el futuro se va haciendo flaco
Y saber que la vida no es mas que un rato
Y sentirme mujer porque lavo los platos

Ay, ya me cansé de decir que te amo y ver que estás dormido
De hacerte una cena especial y ver que te haz ido
De ser una ama de casa y nada más
Con la diferencia del siempre y el jamas
Y hasta sentirme feliz cuando te vas

Detrás de mi ventana
Veo pasar la mañana en la espera de la noche
Me destapo el descote para que este te provoque
Tu fallida ansiedad

Detrás de mi ventana
Veo pasar el destino disfrazado de asesino
Burlándose a carcajadas de este ingrato concuvino
Detrás de mi ventana se me va la vida
Contigo pero sola

Ya me cansé de ser para ti como cualquier camisa
Que se plancha y se arruga al compás de tu risa
De ser un objeto más en tu casa
Como un trapo, una silla, una simple tasa
Y que tu ni te enteres de que es lo que pasa

Detrás de mi ventana
Veo pasar la mañana en la espera de la noche
Me destapo el descote para que este te provoque
Tu fallida ansiedad

Detrás de mi ventana
Veo pasar el destino disfrazado de asesino
Burlándose a carcajadas de este ingrato concuvino
Detrás de mi ventana se me va la vida
Contigo pero sola
Ay, pero sola",Detras de Mi Ventana,1996
Yuri,"Solo tengo recuerdos
De un pasado feliz

Algo duro sin ti

Y volver a reír

En mi vida, solo quedan esperanzas
En mis sueños, mi ilusión siempre eres tú
Solo vivo esperando tu regreso
Con tu marcha te llevaste, mi corazón

Han pasado unos años
Y por fin te encontré
La sonrisa en mis labios
Salio a flor de piel, soy feliz

Me he enterado en el parque
Que te has casado otra vez
Pero quiero decirte
Que siempre te querré

Yuri,"Quien eres tu que llora en silencio 
Quien eres tu 
Que viene de lejos 
Cansado de amar 
Cansado de tanta espera 
De un poco de paz 
En guerras de amor 

Quien te ve, no ve tu historia. 
Quien eres tu 
Yo se 

Se que te amare como ame un día 
Nunca te deje de pensar yo se quien eres tu 
Nunca me olvide, nunca me canse de esperar 
Por tu amor, hasta aquel día 
Y ese día es hoy. 

Quien dice adiós se olvida que el tiempo 
Transforma en si, el no del silencio 
La fuerza de amar esta hecha de movimientos 
Y amar es hacer, eterno el momento. 

Hoy yo se que todos los caminos los camine por ti.

No daña, ni condena
Porque mejor terminar antes que causar pena
Porque mis ojos ya no aguantan más engaños
Más tristezas
Hoy mis lágrimas se van

Si es pa sufrir
Mejor me quedo sola
Porque prefiero vivir que estar contando las horas

Si es pa sufrir
Mejor me quedo sola
Qué caso tiene fingir, mejor me quedo sola
Y mientras tanto yo
Te extrañaré, te lloraré
Pero me levanto sola

A veces es mejor caer
Que estar colgado de una soga
Piénsalo bien porque me iré
Como en el mar se van las olas

Te olvidaré y viviré
Porque nadie de amor se ahoga
Porque nadie de amor se ahoga

¡Ay! Porque nadie de amor se ahoga
¡Ay!, porque nadie de amor se ahoga
¡Ay!, porque nadie de amor se ahoga

Quédate si estás dispuesto a amarme de verdad
Y con mi amor yo haré que nunca te arrepientas

Porque un amor de verdad
No daña, ni condena
Porque mejor terminar antes que causar pena
Porque mis ojos ya no aguantan más engaños
Más tristezas
Hoy mis lágrimas se van

Si es pa sufrir
Mejor me quedo sola
Porque prefiero vivir que estar contando las horas

Si es pa sufrir
Mejor me quedo sola
Qué caso tiene fingir, la vida es una sola
Y mientras tanto yo
Te extrañaré, te lloraré
Pero me levanto sola

A veces es mejor caer

Por no aceptar que el sueño termino.

En aguas de este llanto,
Me perdonas, si guardo tu consejo sin oir.

El aire que me falta why no respiro, 
Ahogandome en silencio si no estas.

But it's sad and it's sweet and I knew it complete
When I wore a younger man's clothes""

Now John at the bar is a friend of mine
He gets me my drinks for free
And he's quick with a joke or to light up your smoke
But there's someplace that he'd rather be
He says, ""Bill, I believe this is killing me""
As the smile ran away from his face
""Well I'm sure that I could be a movie star
If I could get out of this place""

Who never had time for a wife
And he's talkin' with Davy, who's still in the Navy
And probably will be for life

Yes, they're sharing a drink they call loneliness
But it's better than drinkin' alone

And the manager gives me a smile
'Cause he knows that it's me they've been comin' to see
To forget about life for a while
And the piano, it sounds like a carnival
And the microphone smells like a beer
And they sit at the bar and put bread in my jar

",Regresa a Mí [Unbreak My Heart],2006
Yuridia,"Some say love it is a river 
That drowns the tender reed 
Some say love it is a razer 
That leaves your soul to blead 

Some say love it is a hunger 
An endless aching need 
I say love it is a flower 
And you it's only seed 

It's the heart afraid of breaking 
That never learns to dance 
It's the dream afraid of waking
That never takes the chance 
It's the one who won't be taken 
Who cannot seem to give 
And the soul afraid of dying
That never learns to live 

When the night has been too lonely 
And the road has been too long 
And you find that love is only 
For the lucky and the strong 
Just remember in the winter
Far beneath the bitter snows 
Lies the seed 
That with the sun's love 
In the spring 
Becomes the rose

por ese idiota que te partió 
en dos pedazos el corazón

Te quise consolar y confesarte que también a mí me dolió 
porque tú sabes muy bien que yo 
estoy de ti enamorado

Perdóname querido amigo 
yo sé muy bien que estás conmigo
Yo sé muy bien que tú me amas
Pero no puedes ser correspondido

En el amor no se manda
el corazón no entiende de palabras 
tan solo vuela donde dice el alma 
y no es tan fácil cortarle las alas

En el amor no se manda
Quisiera amarte como tú me amas
Y yo también quisiera que me amaras 
pero al destino no le da la gana 

tal vez mañana el corazón de los dos tenga una nueva esperanza
Tal vez mañana el amor ya no nos dé la espalda

Te juro que me duele en el alma cada vez que te veo sufrir 
saber que lloras solo por mí
Por el amor que me tienes 

quisiera convencerme yo misma de empezar a quererte a ti 
pero por más que vuelva a insistir 
el corazón no lo entiende

Perdóname cariño mío 
yo solo quiero estar contigo 
yo sé muy bien que no me amas 
pero quisiera ser correspondido

No aceptas que la historia ha terminado,
De todo aquello nada te resto.

Que cualquier dia pierdo los sentidos,
Por no aceptar que el sueño termino.

Si acaso, mi juventud perdiera en este intento,
En aguas de este llanto,
Me perdonas, si guardo tu consejo sin oir.

El aire que me falta why no respiro, 
Ahogandome en silencio si no estas.

Suavemente como en sueños
Me acerco a ti
Sin poder decirte, te amo

No imaginas que difícil es
Mirarte así dormido mientras
Acaba nuestra historia
En esta noche rota y triste

No
Yo no puedo despertarte
Y perderme entre tus manos
Como arena

A donde va el amor
Que calla
Que se lleva en el alma
Y se va alejando como el viento

A donde va el amor
Que un olvida
Que te quema la vida
Y se duerme poco a poco con dolor

Te recorro en mis recuerdos
Y otra vez descubro que tu cuerpo
Arde en mi memoria
Como fuego viejo y eterno

Oh!
Acaso volverá
De algún modo tantos besos
Que guarde en tu boca

A donde va el amor
Que calla
Que se lleva en el alma
Y se va alejando como el viento

A donde va el amor
Que un olvida
Que te quema la vida
Y se duerme poco a poco con dolor

Pero al verte siento miedo
De decir tu nombre por ultima vez

Dime a donde va el amor
Que calla
Que se lleva en el alma
Y se va alejando como el viento

Quererte a ti es conjugar
El verbo amar en soledad
Un te quiero sin respuesta

Es haber perdido el miedo al dolor
Es luchar contra nadie la batalla

Es callar

De nada sirve que yo te implore

Entre estas cuatro paredes de mi habitación
Cuantas horas he esperado tu llamada ausente
O tu voz arrepentida en el contestador

Cuantas palabras calladas
Cuando entre tus brazos,
Los míos regalaron besos sin contemplación

Cuantas tardes nos comíamos a besos, cuantas
Tantas como días hace que te fuiste amor

No hay que mirar atrás
Pues estoy luchando

Yo sin ti no se como tenerme

Y de buenas a primeras en quien confiabas
Se va llevándose los muebles de tu corazón
