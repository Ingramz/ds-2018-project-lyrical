Venom,"Midnight six sixty six
Torment beastial sex
Mother screaming in pain
Father rules hell's domain
I don't want to be born
I don't want it
Leave me in hell
Danger gold pentagram
Sacrifice full blooded ram
Karma Hell bears its child
Reaper sharpens his scythe
I don't want to be born
I don't want it
Leave me in hell
Hail Satanic Majesties
Sabbath my crucifix
Evil chief satanist
Danger possessed by hell
Master cast me a spell
I don't want to be born
I don't want it
Leave me in hell
",Leave Me in Hell,1982
Venom,"Rising from my deadly tomb I've got
maddened eyes with fright
fingers bleeding fast heart beating
the moons my only light
Ashes to ashes, dust to dust
If God won't have me, then the Devil must

[CHORUS:]
we will raise the dead
we will raise the dead
we will raise the dead
stop at nothing raise the dead
Gaze across the blackened yard
my mind is filled with dread
so give me all the powers of Hell
and I'll raise the dead
Ashes to ashes, dust to dust
The hotter the fire, the greater the lust

[CHORUS:]
I hear the star of the Necromancer
my blood is black and my heart doth bleed
I am infernal and my mind's in torment
I'll raise the dead make the world unclean

Laughing as my legions rise
control the zombies mind
I hold Hell close to my breast
I'm leaving God behind
Ashes to ashes, dust to dust
I'll enter hellfire, I'll break the crust

[CHORUS:]",Raise the Dead,1982
Venom,"Hooded figures, clouded skies
Fires burn within their eyes
Pentagram with baphomet midnight strikes
Goat of mendes lifts his head
Summons up the living dead
Virgin flesh lies tied and bound
Hail satanas


S.A.C.R.I.F.I.C.E.
Scream for mercy cry and repent satan claims your soul
Sacrifice, sacrifice, oh so nice, sacrifice


Candles glow on alters bare
A virgin's death is needed there
Sacrifice to Lucifer my master
Bring the chalice raise the knife
Welcome to my sacrifice
Plunge the dagger in her breast
I insist


S.A.C.R.I.F.I.C.E.
Limbs weaken limbs fly away demons rejoice
Sacrifice, sacrifice, name your price, sacrifice


Death is swift 'neath satan's sword
All the same young and old
Life means nothing to my lord
Drink from chalice warm and sweet
Virgin's heart final beat
Lightning strikes virgin dies
Satan smiles


S.A.C.R.I.F.I.C.E.
The moon is black and the witches dance, heaven is denied
Sacrifice, sacrifice, sacrifice, sacrifice



",Sacrifice,1982
Venom,"Teacher caught me masturbating underneath the desk
She looked at me and winked her eye said ""see you after class""
I heard the school bell ring that told me that the day was done
She called me back and locked the door my lessons just begun
Teachers pet
Teachers wet
Sitting down she crossed her legs her skirt crept up her thigh
Feeling something start to rise my thought began to fly
You've been a naughty boy she said now that you can't conceal
I'll have to punish you the best way that I feel
Teachers pet
Teachers wet
She took my hand and gently placed it in between her thighs
With open legs and heavy breath she slowly closed her eyes
Her flesh was aching and her hands began to stray
On thing that I know for sure I won't forget today
Teachers pet
Teachers wet
Pulled me down forwards her mound teacher tasted sweet sixty-nine
I don't mean lines this was teachers treat
Played hide and seek with teachers mouth her lips were warm and wet
Now today I've had my way and teacher won't forget
",Teacher's Pet,1982
Venom,"I have been to Hell and back - kissed satanic Queen
Traveling at the speed of light - saw thing never seen
Arm in arm with Lucifer - Belial on my back
I have swam the lake of flames - walked forbidden tracks
To Hell - and back
To Hell - and back
I've made love to Lilleth fair - danced the zombies dance
I have shook the reapers hand - broke his deathly trance
Present at ungodly births - mutants writhe in pain
I'm possessed by Hell itself - I'm the man insane
To Hell - and back
To Hell - and back
Ride with me
To Hell - and back
You can take a trip with me - Hell's my final home
If you wish to live at night - watch the demons room
Holding high the Southern Cross - watch the mortals bleed
Drink the blood and feel my wrath - watch the mutants breed

Venom,"Placed in the wilderness, naked and cold
The night draws the warmth from my flesh
Howls in the distance
The wolves they catch my scent
They yearn for my blood warm and fresh

But I 

Cannot run, I cannot hide
I'm moments old, yet terrified
Snarling breath is on my face
I am damned in this place

Morning breaks the evening darkness
Daylight sings so loud
Father holds my in his arms
And laughs for he is proud
'All is well' my mother cries
A kiss for me her child
But at night my heart turns black
And calls me to the wild

In the night where the wolf-bane grows
In the night when the full moon glows

Cry wolf 

Alone in your room
By the light of the moon
Your glory is shining so bright
You prey for the day
Oh show me the way
The devil takes over tonight
It's too late, night is here
The time that you dread
The time when you loose all control

Your bodies in pain
You cry in vein
Satan takes over your soul

Cry wolf 

Even a man who's pure of heart
He says his prayers by night
Bane from a wolf when the wolf bane grows
And the moon's full and bright

I cannot resist their call
It strengthens as I age
To the pack to join the feast
And fear immortal rage
Never can I live the life
Of every normal child
Forever I must answer
To the call of the wild

Venom,"Genocide

Standing in the wings
The reaper waits to play his part

Take heed the golden dawn

Genocide

A prayer from the sinner
For he repents for his soul

For heaven is his goal

Heathen, disbeliever

Genocide the cure of mankind
Armageddon patiently decides

Death unveils his gown
The place is truly on fire

You'll see no light
With genocide

Life or death it used to be
But now there is no choice

With cries of every nations voice

No time for even fear

When the unborn child is old

Trying her new bra

Women of the law
Coming hard on oral

Without form it's haunting the air
It's in a kiss - within a bite
It brings the darkness into light

It's a song for Olympus
Cracks the morpheus dream
It oozes the ozone
Heavenly screaems
By the golden waterfall
Through the fog on the ice
There's a voice in the shell call
It's demanding precise

We're chanting - They're chanting
The chanting of the priests

Yells ascend into the sleeping
Screech the hawk relpies
Shudders pound the marching hearts
In reborn synchronize
Held in force the feeding prism
Triangle diaboli
Catalogues the souls inside
The city in the sea

Where there's life without presence
There's a voice without sound
Deep inside you can't feel it

To the tombs in the sand

Calls you to the sacred land

Wakes in mortuary
This is the place where life's a lie

Gasping in the air
Wind breathes words - She's not there
Deserts vast and barren
Still the witches jargon
Just my life surrender
Promises of splendor

Blinding lights flash at me

I can't believe this place is real
Wake me from this dream

Silver shields the rain
Her grip so tight that my life drains
Poison messages sent

Nectar from the serpent
Never life surrender

Che con un po'di trucco e con la mimica

Cosi vicini e veri
Ti fan scordare le parole
Confondono I pensierei

Of their eternal home

Watch them swapping eyes
Writhing in a mound of death

Digging fresh arrival thus
To lovingly caress

Find true the words I've said
No place for mortal magic

Built high forever strong

For the dead don't die for long
At the dawn of darkness
The keeper takes his keys
Locking out the living
For the dead don't want to leave

Could leave me dead

Terrified
Cocooned within the web

As friends gather round and mourners they weep
My mind thinks of all the things I have done
My body is cold but my heart beat goes on
And on, and on 

As they lower me down into that hole in the ground 
I scream out for help but they hear not a sound
I tear at the lid, my fingers they bleed 
Is this happening to me or is it just a dream 
Summon the dead
Baphomets call
Blood on my hands

""Let me out of here!"" 

My bones are decayed, my flesh it doth rot 
I'm lying in silk, take the lid off this box 
My lungs gasp for air, my eyes scream for sight 
I promise the rise of my body this night

Vents,"Introduction â?? Trials
We have a whole lot of superstars on this stage here tonight,
And I want you to know one thing, this isâ?¦

Verse 1 â?? Suffa
Hilltop, that's where the blood runs,
Thick, it's where kings bury there loved ones,
Sick, kids guard their crop with a slug gun,
From rips, move like Schapelle on a drug run,
So quick, there's kids in the park waiting,
These are my poison diaries like Mark Latham,
So start hating, though you know in your heart,
We've been owning this art since our flow in the park.

Verse 2 â?? Mortar
You can't serve me like Serena and Venus,
Comparatively I leave you looking like the machinist,
Cats know they've been hit, when I spike the mic level,
And draw blood like intravenous,
Without a pencil I'm hell bent,
Leave dents in the condenser, you can tell when,
Mortar's been in the booth to rhyme,
I don't scratch vinyl, I scratch up the mic with my canines.

Verse 3 â?? Trials and Sesta
Mr Trials, young ladies jump in the sack,
I never kiss and tell instead I fuck it and brag,
I'm an angry drunk when I'm grabbing a rum,
And skull shots till we fall from grace like Eric Clapton's son,
South of the country, west of the city,
Chip into that kitty if we're going to be drinking until the skank pretty,
Will he attack? When he snap, got the track like,
Bring it back, hear him rap? Isn't that Funkoars?
You can find us staggered in a cipher,
Turning human traffic to a five car pile up,
We leave them all for dead,
I used to think big till it killed L, Pun, Smalls and Kev,
Like bad move, got you looking like you're eavesdropping the devil,
And T set the theme to send them to hell,
Bet on it, you're never better, I tell them again,
Seddy bury every adversary he put against.

Verse 4 â?? Hau
Fresh off the boat with an impressive approach,
To writing rhymes like pressing your throat,
The unquestionable dopeness, and oh yes,
It's the one and only, in the house like the gun is on me
Got you gronks saying blimey he's clever,
He's brighter than that sun in the shiniest of weather,
Girls you want diamonds forever?
Well throw your hymens the sky if you feel the vibe.

Verse 5 â?? Drapht
None of gravities properties are on top of me,
Can't hold me back from taking a stab like Chopper Read,
Can't hold me back, I'm back around again like stalkers,
My mic holds a force like a sword or a tomahawk,
To Conan, walking with no man now,
'cause you freeze when you spit like a snow mans mouth,
Arouse with every word, first you've got to know this,
We don't belong together like Rove and showbiz.

Chorus
And we what? â?? Run with crew,
Whose what? â?? Blood is blue,
Through life's â?? Fucking zoo,
And we might â?? Come for you,
And we what? â?? Run with crew,
Whose what? â?? Blood is blue,
Through life's â?? Fucking zoo,
And we might â?? Come for you.

Verse 6 â?? Vents
The saga begin, RPM drama again,
My lung burn, dangerous carcinogen,
Starving like Stalin in parliament in Prague again,
In camouflage targeting,
In Rock Creek Park, carve terror in the bark,
Blueprint, build pyramids in the dark,
The blood run deep, renegade creep,
Hilltop connect bro, centigrade heat.

Verse 7 â?? Muphin and Pegz
Muph, some give me shit for my name,
But I don't give a shit about you shit for brains,
Been a long while so I know the game,
It's more about music than your clothing range,
We're here to overtake, setting the standard,
Obese crew, we're the devilish family,
Stand on stage accepting a Grammy,
For the most incredible rapping since edible panties,
Unforgettable pansies in a flickering fit,
Knickers in a twist in a spiral of shit,
Undeniable gift with decipherable spits,
My fireball pit will burn you Muppets,
True rugged, blue blooded dignitary,
Crews love it when we do something visionary,
Move up never lose touch, living ready,
This is the hard road cargo hitting heavy.

Verse 8 â?? Robby Balboa
Robby Balboa bless the text,
Deliver you ticket to death,
Rivers of rhythm ripping the flesh,
Triple your bets on the primitive pest,
Selling sick smut from the cinema steps,
It begins with a breath, a kid killing his pets,
Just sitting in debt when I'm feeling a wreck,
Life's a bitch and so we're wringing her neck,
Fuck a metro in a pink shirt 'cause we're kicking the set.

Verse 9 â?? Honz
The Funkoars and the Hilltop, yes, we still rocking it,
And I ain't going near your bill unless we fucking topping it,
I drink till I'm all over the shop like barcodes,
And as far as rap goes, I've mastered my flows,
Certified and we back again to wreak havoc,
With these pads and pens so understand my friend,
We about to take over just like Hove spit it,
To the most gifted get them glasses up and toast with us.

Verse 10 â?? Pressure
Pressure MC, born with a mechanical mind,
The talent of rhyme, instinctual like animal kind,
Now I flow with the best, from east coast to the west,
We live in the flesh like my raps sewn in your chest,
You can't fathom the dopest flow, amateurs don't you know,
What ever happened to a good old fashioned broken nose?
Don't become a casualty of my faculty,
Damn I got spine but you'll never see the back of me.

Chorus
And we what? â?? Run with crew,
Whose what? â?? Blood is blue,
Through life's â?? Fucking zoo,
And we might â?? Come for you,
And we what? â?? Run with crew,
Whose what? â?? Blood is blue,
Through life's â?? Fucking zoo,
And we might â?? Come for you.

Counts elephants and frogs
Marching from her skirt

Breaking my door

Drinks champagne, eats Belouga, the night's long
It's quiet, icebergs pass along
There's no wind, says a lady, but its cold

On the below-deck, the people dream of something
From tables lit by white candles
What are you doing here? I am lost, says a boy
I can't sleep, says the other, it's so warm

SIowly, with a sigh, the fickelness of fate
Ripped open the hull, tearing it patiently
Ice blade cleaves the iron, it's time to drown our sins
In a delicate screeching, iron tears

The sun-deck shivers, the below-deck screams
Water is gushing up without invitation
Swallowing up mouths, swallowing up noses
And the dreams and the candles, we should have eaten when it was warm

Tonight there's no wind, the ocean is calm and quiet
It's waiting, waiting, catching its breath
It's true it could rain
But quietly the sea is waiting for its children
The howling sea

Do you hear?
I hear nothing
Save our souls, save our souls, help us Marconi, help us
l'm gonna swim straight ahead

And the lord, slightly troubled, slowly swallows the finest Çalvados

to right on Roq la Rue
Past the Crocodile

Then you slide down 4th again
Where the Claremont used to be
CLA-REM-ONT

Then you find the Uzbek warlord
You collide with Tamerlane
His teeth are brown

Oh he doesn't speak
he prods you
Then he says a burning train
is back in your hometown

Then you roll down Denny Way
past the pink rotating elephant

And you say well come what may
Now I'm in my element
I'm where I ought to be

But Tamerlane is hot
He's mounted on the elephant
The coffee's on the boil

And he says, what have you got?
You say I don't have anything
He says you must have oil

Seven sets of appetites

then comes Opportunism

He needs a bit of elbow room
His name is Haste

He fires off a slew of e-mails
And says, Put your hands together, boys
for six aka Waste

The boys all look around
They looked at number seven 
Reclining in his chair

He's got his headphones on
His head is full of paradise
He isn't there

And you wanna know what is
And also what is not
Don't you girl?

And you want to see your eyes 
Reflected in the world

And we said How's it going Ken?

Celebrate years
Here's looking at you kid
Wipe away tears
Long time since we're together
Now I hope it's forever

Ideal love flies away now

You gave her away to the hero
Words don't express my meaning
Notes could not spell out the score

Venus In Furs,"Baby's on fire
Better throw her in the water
Look at her laughing
Like a heifer to the slaughter

Baby's on fire
And all the laughing boys are bitching
Waiting for photos
Oh the plot is so bewitching

Rescuers row row
Do your best to change the subject
Blow the wind blow blow
Lend some assistance to the object

Photographers snip snap
Take your time she's only burning
This kind of experience
Is necessary for her learning

If you'll be my flotsam
I could be half the man I used to
They said you were hot stuff
And that's what baby's been reduced to

Juanita and Juan
Very clever with maracas
Making their fortunes
Selling secondhand tobaccoes

Juan dances at Chico's
And when the clients are evicted
He empties the ashtrays
And pockets all that he's collected

But baby's on fire
And all the instruments agree that
Her temperature's rising
But any idiot would know that

To see it twist and turn
To taste both sweet and dry

Haven't tuned in to the blow by blow
She move, I move, let her go, I go
Stir it up, stand back, watch a firework show
Ayo, too proud to quit when it's broken
Too in denial to admit when it's over
Drown in the separate ends of an ocean
Both in too deep to know where the coast is
Surrounded by waves and the hurricanes
Gaze, when we together ain't none of y'all safe
So buckle or get out of our way
Up in smoke, down in flames 'cause man

When we cross the line, ayo

Ain't no broken pride and these aren't paper cuts

But I'd rather war with you all of summer
Than a low key peace with another, ayy
One by one every cut
Yeah, gets deeper, who they to judge
'Cause when it's on we roar like the thunder
Then it's RIP to the other days
Cycle repeat to the lesson get learned, man
You play with fire, your bridges get burnt, man
Standoff, only making this worse
But don't nobody move and nobody gets hurt, man

Sucker-punches traded, all fun and games
I dealt her cards, fall where they lay

The night we met
There was magic abroad in the air
There were angels dining at the Ritz
And a nightingale sang in Berkeley square

I may be right I may be wrong
But I'm perfectly willing to swear
That when you turned and smiled at me
A nightingale sang in Berkeley square

The moon that lingered over London town
Poor puzzled moon he wore a frown
How could he know we two were so in love
The whole damned world seemed upside down

The streets of town were paved with stars
It was such a romantic affair
And as we kissed and said goodnight
A nightingale sang in Berkeley square

How strange it was
How sweet and strange
There was never a dream to compare
To those hazy crazy nights we met
And a nightingale sang in Berkeley square

Ah this heart of mine
Loud and fast
Like a merry-go-round in a fair
We would dance cheek to cheek
And a nightingale sang in Berkeley square

The dawn came stealing up
All gold and blue
To interrupt our rendez-vous
I still remember how you smiled and said
Was that a dream or was it true?

As the dancing feet of Astaire
And like an echo far away

Are you sorry

And called you sweetheart

Seem empty and bare
Do you gaze at your doorstep

Shall I come back again

Are you lonesome tonight

You know someone said the the worlds a stage
And each must play a part
Fate had me playing in love with you as my sweetheart

You read your lines so cleverly and never missed a cue
Then came Act Two
You seemed to change, you acted strange
And why I've never known
Honey, you lied when you said you loved me
And I had no cause to doubt you
But I'd rather go on hearing your lies
Than to go on living without you
Now the stage is bare and I'm standing there
With emptiness all around
And if you won't come back to me
Then they can bring the curtain down""

Took me away
To long rocky beaches
And you by the bay
We started a story
Whose end must now wait

I feel the wind blow
I feel brave and daring
I feel my blood flow

Is keeping perfectly still

Sees the sun going down

See the world spinning round

Talking perfectly loud

And he never seems to notice

Sees the sun going down

In a circle snakes where saints are a small fraction
Cover my ears an can still hear the fall happenin

And you are my inspiration many emotions mangle my meditation
And every time I spit I keep tastin' soul preservation
Link with the lord for some life renovation
I keep reservations for conversation

None felon bomb of a none denomination
A simple servant out here sicken sevens on the nation

We standing in the light eternal life is what we facin'
And ain't nothing adjacent and can't nothing replace the man

Trippin in any city, county, town, or zipcode
Interstates, highways, byways, backroads
Skylines twinklin' pretty but still look dark
Pushin evil outta these borders and tell it to depart

Hear the cries from famined cities where crime and sin crumble the streets
Where heat waves seek and earthquakes shake the territory
I see my man on the block that goes anywhere the just may blow
Downtown in the middle of the night, neon light bright where there's no windows
Gangs bang with gun and chain until their brains hang out
Then pick another gang to see if they hang so that they can claim they clout
It's where the worth of young youth is getting skewed and reduced
They've been handed the wrong juice and straight lost their innocence
Fatherless dealing with rage fight to escape the shame
Finger pointing ignites the blame, inner bitterness beginsto flame
Not seeing beyond the hood life is automatically lacking
Demons of death on desolate blocks and they're feenin' for destiny jackings
But the news is marvelous, we can start repairing thebreech
Christ came to destroy the works so you can start repairing the streets
And he's looking for people presenting an ultimatum to evil
Threating lethal either leave or simply get drawn off the easel

Verdelle Smith,"The town I came from was quiet and small
We played in the meadows where the grass grew so tall
In summer the lilacs would grow everywhere
The laughter of children would float in the air

As I grew older I had to roam
Far from my family, far from my home
Into the city, where lives can be spent
Lost in the shadows of tar and cement.

And every night I'd sit alone and learn
What loneliness meant
Up in my rented room above the world
Of tar and cement.

Each day I'd wake up and look at the sky
Think of the meadows where I used to lie
Then I'd remember all of that's gone
You're in the city, you better push on
Get what you came for, before it's too late
Get what you came for, the meadows can wait.

And every night I'd sit alone and learn
What loneliness meant
Up in my rented room above the world
Of tar and cement.

Many years later, tired at last
I headed for home to look for my past
I looked for the meadows, there wasn't a trace
Six lanes of highway had taken their place
Where were the lilacs and all that they meant
Nothing but acres of tar and cement.
Yet I can see it there so clearly now
Where has it gone?
Yes I can see it there so clearly now
Where has it gone?

Where are the meadows? (tar and cement)
Where are the lilacs? (tar and cement)
And where is the tall grass? (tar and cement)
The laughter of children? (tar and cement)
Nothing but acres (tar and cement)

Do you remember when you were a child then

And you laughed when you were a child then

And if you think that we are older now
It's just our heads are outterflies

Et puis, voici mon coeur qui ne bat que pour vous ;
Ne le déchirez pas avec vos deux mains blanches
Et qu'à vos yeux si beaux l'humble présent soit doux,
L'humble présent soit doux

J'arrive tout couvert encore de rosée
Que le vent du matin vient glacer à mon front.
Souffrez que ma fatigue, à vos pieds reposée
Rêve des chers instants qui la délasseront.

Sur votre jeune sein, laissez rouler ma tête
Toute sonore encor de vos derniers baisers ;
Laissez-là s'apaiser de la bonne tempête,
Et que je dorme un peu puisque vous reposez.",Green,1990

And his meat you couldn't chaw,
Nearly drove me crazy

Do you miss me like I miss you, is it cloudy all the time
Do you tremble when the phone rings and you think I'm on the line

Does it thunder and lightnin' even when the sun shines
Is it raining at your house like it's raining at mine

It still lingers everywhere

On the night-stand, is your picture
The one I've held, since you've been gone
The same picture you gave to me when we first met

Have all died

Have finally dried

She said I don't want to hurt him but it's out of control
I feel so guilty 'cause he'll be so helpless
He won't understand why I just got to go.

Now I come to the garden alone
All my reasons I once had for living are gone
Sometimes when I feel like I just cant go on
I come to the garden alone.

Or a quiet Sunday morning with no church bells ringing
If you've watched as the heart of a child breaks in two

If son when you're grown up
You want everything nice
I've got your future sewn up
If you take this advice

Be a clown, be a clown
All the world loves a clown
Act the fool, play the calf
And you'll always have the last laugh

Wear the cap and the bells
And you'll rate with all the great swells

Why be a major poet and you'll owe it for years
When crowds'll pay to giggle if you wiggle your ears
Be a clown, be a clown, be a clown

Be a clown, be a clown
All the world loves a clown
If you just make 'em roar
Watch your Mounte bank account soar

A bachelor's degree won't even keep you in clothes
But millions you will win if you can spin on your nose

Verne Langdon,"I was born on a farm out in Ioway
A flaming youth who was bound that he'd fly away
I packed my grip and I grabbed my saxophone
Can't read notes, but I play anything by ear
I made up tunes on the sounds that I used to hear
When I'd start to play folks used to say
""Sounds a little Goofus to me""
 
Cornfed chords appeal to me, I like rustic harmony
Hold that note and change the key, that's called ""Goofus""
Not according to the rules that you learn at music schools
But the folks just dance like fools, they go ""Goofus""
 
Got a job but I just couldn't keep it long
The leader said that I played all the music wrong
So I stepped out with an outfit of my own
Got together a new kind of orchestree
And we all played just the same ""Goofus"" harmony
And I must admit we made a hit

Our beautiful garden has withered away,
Where you planted roses,the weeds seem to say,

Like a nightingale without a song to sing

Walking down a strange new street
Hearing words that I have never heard
From a girl I've yet to meet

I'm as busy as a spider spinning daydreams
I'm as giddy as a baby on a swing

Un problema era tarea, y el amor felicidad 
El verano era mas largo mi refugio era mama 
Nada se quedaba dentro yo sabia perdonar 
Siempre disfrutando el tiempo siempre siendo de verdad 

Aquellos 15 años, aquellos findes que lejos estan 
Aquellas ilusiones ya no se tienen no se sienten igual 
Aquellas noches largas, aquellas plazas, y esas ganas de amar 
Mi bici amarilla (amarilla y azul) y aquel verano nunca volveran 

Y gracias fue tan bonito 
Por darme tanto, cuando era niño 
Y gracias lo necesito 
Lo llevo dentro y 
Vive conmigo",Gracias,2006

Welcome to the system
Here's the situation
It's a bit confusing
Welcome to the maze

Everybody sees what
Everybody wants to
Everyone avoids
Every other gaze

I will be your mentor
I'll be your advisor
I'll do what I do
And you will look away

Forgetting what you see
Has always been much wiser
But someone in the back is missing what I say

Welcome to the park now
We supply amusements
Everybody rides
But everybody pays

What good's causing problems
When no one's complaining
What good is a martyr
If no one is saved

Everybody knows us
Everybody sees us
Every single child
Can tell you where we are

Every politician
Says that we are leaving
But in all this time
We haven't gone too far

Got a complaint in the system
Got a complaint in the system

You should understand it
It's not underhanded
It's really quite simple you see

The right and the wrong of it
Long and the short of it
Black and the white of it

Forget the sight of it
It is so much cheaper
To be no one's keeper, trust me

Complain

In the dead of the night
You can stab with a knife
But it's rare you'll ever get anywhere

So we laugh in delight
Till you turn on a light
And we scatter for the darkness
Or the corners filled with blackness

And we're, there, there, there, there, there, there
Where, where, where, where, where, where
There, there, there, there, there, there
Where, where, where, where, where, where, there

Även om det är över nu
Allting har förändrats
Men du finns kvar
Allt var svävande men nu så ser ja klart

Du var gammal
Jag var äldre
Och nu sågs vi igen
Gått så lång tid så länge sen
Decennier tillbaks
Men jag minns det såväl
Varför kärleken brunnit
Utav olika skäl
Varför jag aldrig släppt det och aldrig gett upp
Trotts min väg vart lång kantats med gupp
Jag stått utan för din port så många gånger
Så många brev många sånger
Minns varje ord varje rad jag skrivit
En längtan så stor
Minns varje dag jag lidit
Har gått genom livet med en övertygelse
Att jag satt något spår
Som har haft betydelse
Aldrig besvarad aldrig tillmötes
En kärlek så varm utan den vilket öde
Från vinter till vår
Sen sommar till höst
Trots att tiden vart svår så gav kärleken tröst
Hjärtan som slår
Vi står där vi stod
Minns det som igår
Första gången du log
Som om jag snubblade pladask
På marken och bara dog

Varje gång är som den första gång vi sågs
Även om det är över nu
Allting har förändratas men du finns kvar
Allt var svävande men nu så ser jag klart

Jag var ung du var yngre
När vi sågs första gången
Rusade förbi mig snabbt på perrongen
Blev hjälplöst förälskat
Obeskrivligt tagen
Som om jag låg ner på marken och blev slagen
Betraktade ditt hår
När det fångades av vinden
Som att svimma på en bergstopp utav svindeln
Sen den stunden satt jag fast i ett nät förtrollad bunden
Tappa hjärtat i knät
Kunde inte tänka logiskt eller sunt
Och för varje sekund som du inte fanns där blev det tung
Började sakta uppvakta på avstånd i brev
Men det spelade ingen roll vad jag skrev
Du hade inte fastnat än inte fattat än
Vilken kärlek som fanns att bara hämta hem
Men efter ett tag
Det började korresponderas
Mina förhoppningar dom väcktes
För att sen raseras
Du flyttade utomlands någon annanstans
Gav bort din hand till en annan man
Och breven som skrevs dom kom aldrig fram
Men mitt hjärta det brann och min åtrå var sann

Jag gav aldrig upp dig när du försvann
Långa dagar blev till nätter sen till år

Varje gång är som den första gång vi sågs
Även om det är över nu
Allting har förändrats
Men du finns kvar
Allt var svävande men nu så ser jag klart

Ååå

Nu står du där på gatan
Sargad av tiden
Huden är grå
Din hållning förvriden
Vill säga nånting men jag kan inte tänka klart
Känslor bubblar upp utan att tänka tillbaks
Trevar mig fram för att etablera kontakt
Tar tag i din hand
Vi brister ut i ett skratt
Det var så länge sen
Men det finns där än
För passionen vi kände kommer alltid igen
Har ett hjärta utan rynkor
Det består intakt
Och drömmar i mitt liv har jag aldrig förlagt
Aldrig nått fram så jag älskat på avstånd
Nu är det mitt tåg och dags för avgång
Stiga på aldrig tveka en minut
För att allt som flyger upp måste landa till slut
Kan inte titta tillbaks trots min vilja är stark
Vi vandrar iväg utan vidröra mark

Varje gång är som den första gång vi sågs
Även om det är över nu
Allting har förändrats
Men du finns kvar
Allt var svävande men nu så ser jag klart

How is it you sing?

How can you jubilate
Sitting in cages
Never taking wing?

Outside the sky waits
Beckoning, beckoning
Just beyond the bars

Staring at the rain
Maddened by the stars?

How is it you sing anything?

How is it you sing?

Whence comes this melody
Constantly floating?
Is it rejoicing or merely a loaming?

Are you discussing?
Or fussing
Or simply dreaming?

Are you crowing?
Are you screaming?
Ring dove and Robinet

Is it for wages?
Singing to be sold?
Have you decided it's safer in cages
Singing when you're told?

My cage has many rooms
Damask and dark
Nothing there sings
Not even my Lark

Larks never will, you know
When they're captive
Teach me to be more adaptive

Io vorrei tanto capirne di piÃ¹, vorrei che non pensassi al male
Che perso nel sonno piÃ¹ chiuso che see'Ã¨,lascia soltanto un impronta nell'aria
Oltre a un respiro d'amaro per noi, ci resta solo il disegno del tempo.
So che avremmo ancora bisogno di crederci,
E anche se a volte parlarne fa male
So che resta un livido amniotico gelido,
Sto percorrendo a ritroso la strada

per noi, ma qui tu scivoli a fondo e non hai
Rifugio per sciogliere il peso che see'Ã¨
In me Ã¨ tardi in me

Sono soltanto parole per me, che la distanza ora complica
Io vorrei tanto capirne di piÃ¹, vorrei che non pensassi al male
Che perso nel sonno piÃ¹ chiuso che see'Ã¨,lascia soltanto un impronta nell'aria
Oltre a un respiro d'amaro per noi, ci resta solo il disegno del tempo.

se non posso nemmeno provare piÃ¹ a reggerti
Nel vuoto che raschia il tuo sguardo specchiandomi
Lasciare che il tempo ora passi sopra di noi
Rendermi immobile al flusso dei giorni

tra noi,ma qui tu scivoli a fondo e non hai
Rifugio per sciogliere il peso che see'Ã¨

Où tu chantais dans les cours

Qu'on te vole ta vie 
Qu'on te vole ta vie 
Qu'on te vole ta vie 

Tu joues deux ou trois arpèges 
Tu vois l'image d'une fille de rêve 
Devant tes yeux 

Un éclair dans ses prunelles 
Et c'est peut-être celle 
Qui va te rendre heureux 

Tu te rappelles cet hiver 
Les cloches de Carmel 
Qui te donnaient le frisson 

Tu voulais voir avec elle 
Les cloches de Carmel 
Qui ne sonnent qu'à l'unisson

Dans tes oreilles

We've got the music in our minds
Going on going on

Tu fais toujours semblant, 
Presque toujours semblant quand tu me fermes les yeux... 

Tu joues l'indifférence,

A la terrasse d'un café, 
Et je regarderais ta figure qui est comme les eaux du Gange,

Véronique Sanson,"Pour l'amour d'un homme 
Elle avait quitté l'Oued en automne 
Elle était un peu folle 
Elle ne craignait ni Dieu, ni personne 
Tout l'été ils se sont vraiment préparés 
Tout l'été ils ont beaucoup voyagé 
Elle était là debout 
Sous le regard flou de son homme 
Et dans sa robe rose 
Elle avait mis des choses qui détonnent 

Tout le monde dort et pourquoi, pourquoi pas elle ? 
Tout le monde dort et pourquoi, pourquoi pas elle ? 

Oh Allah 
A quoi te sert d'avoir un nom 
Pourquoi ce feu, ce tonnerre 
Au nom de quoi fais-tu la guerre 
Mais si c'est ça que tu veux 
Tout le monde fermera les yeux

Et le camion explose 
Elle a donné sa vie pour la cause 
La mort est sur le sable 
Te sens-tu mutilé dans ton âme ?

Tout le monde dort et pourquoi, pourquoi pas toi ? 
Tout le monde dort et pourquoi, pourquoi pas toi ? 

Oh Allah 
A quoi te sert d'avoir un nom 
Pourquoi le feu, la misère 
Si j'étais toi je serais pas fière 
Mais si c'est ça que tu veux 
Tout le monde fermera les yeux 

Oh Allah 
A quoi te sert d'avoir un nom 
Si tu as trois vœux à faire 
Choisis-les bien parmi tes pairs 
Mais si c'est ça que tu veux 
Tout le monde fermera les yeux 

A quoi te sert d'avoir un nom 
Pourquoi ce feu, ce tonnerre 
Au nom de quoi fais-tu la guerre 

A quoi te sert d'avoir un nom 
C'est pour souiller le désert 
Avec le sang versé pour Allah 

Pourquoi le feu et la misère 
Prie pour la fin de la guerre 
Délivre-les du mal 
Allah 

Pourquoi le feu, le tonnerre 
Mais c'est de toi qu'on se sert 
C'est en ton nom qu'on se bat

A quoi te sert d'avoir un nom 
Pourquoi la faim, la misère 
Si j'étais toi je serais pas fière

Véronique Sanson,"Toute petite chanson pour toi ce soir
Je ne suis même pas démaquillée.
Je te donne le noir de mon désespoir
Comme une grenade dégoupillée.
Ça me lance, si bien que bat ma tempe
Et dans tes yeux d'ancien bébé.
Je vois les deux courbes de mes hanches
Ondulant vers l'éternité, vraiment loin, vraiment loin.

Et demain, peut-être après-demain
Je bougerai mes pierres, je changerai de peau.
Et tant pis si mes démons reviennent
Je les attends qu'ils viennent, ils ne tueront plus rien
Car l'Amour, comme un caméléon
Change les couleurs du bonheur.

Toute petite chanson pour toi ce soir, ma vérité est
démaquillée.
Je mes dans tes mains mon plus grand espoir
Comme une grenade dégoupillée.
Je me sens si bien que bat ma tempe
Avec des larmes sur le coté
Reflétant la courbe de mes hanches
Ondulant vers l'éternité, vraiment loin, vraiment loin.

Et demain, peut-être après-demain
Je chasserai mes pierres, je changerai de peau.
Et tant pis si mes démons reviennent
Je les attends qu'ils viennent, ils ne tueront plus rien

Véronique Sanson,"Le désir
Plus fort que tout sur terre
Tapi dans l’ombre tous les jours
Un sentiment qu’on adore
Mais qui nous retient encore
On garde tout en nous
On devient fou
L’amour nous brûle partout
Même si quelquefois
Ca coûte tant de le dire
Ca coûte tant de le faire
Ca peut prendre un soupir
Sorti droit de l’enfer
Qui peut juger nos âmes
Et qui peut lever nos fers
Même le dieu de l’amour
Roule dans la poussière
Et on se sent tout petit
Tout nu tout nu
Trouvez moi le nombre d’or
Le désir latent dans mon regard
Dans les abîmes de ma mémoires
Avant de voler ton âme
Je voudrais calmer ma flamme
Il y a quelque chose en moi
Sans foi ni loi
Qui m’épouvante parfois
Même si quelquefois
Ca coûte tant de le dire
Ca coûte tant de le faire
Ca peut prendre un sourire

Véronique Sanson,"C’était un lundi à onze heures
J’étais toute seule et j’avais peur
J’avais besoin d’amour en moi
Je voulais séduire cet homme-là
J’avais besoin d’un homme à moi

Tout me semblait de bon augure
Pour repartir à l’aventure
La lune était haut dans le ciel
J’avais redéployé mes ailes
Et dans la foule
Je ne savais pas où mon destin
Croiserait le sien

C’était dans un jet set aride
Les femmes riaient de leurs yeux vides
Les gens n’admiraient que l’argent
Et il faisait partie des leurs
Ça m’a fait vraiment vraiment peur

Je lui ai caressé les mains
Elles étaient douces comme du satin
Et dans une marée de brouillard
J’ai eu besoin de son regard
Qui était doux
J’ai su soudain que mon désir le rendait fou

Ce fut un amour insensé
Violent comme les vents alizés
Comme un ouragan permanent
Plus grand que toutes les cathédrales
Si érotique et immoral

Voilà comment les choses arrivent
N’en soufflez mot à âme qui vive
Et bien ma foi, je l’aime toujours
C’était un lundi à onze heures
Et j’avais peur
Je sais que mon destin est lié avec le sien",Jet Set,1996

Et bien oui c'était moi
Qui harcelais tes rêves
Je te voulais vivant
Et si ta jalousie vient m'percer le cur
Je te donne une minute
Pour te casser ailleurs
Hôtel Biron - Chambre 22
Tout le temps que j'ai passé
A séduire tes caprices
Les gens riaient d'un rire
Puissant et maléfique
C'est comme ça qu'ils existent
Et peut-être sous un pont
Je te trouverai magique
Et puis dans un moment subtil
Et magnifique
Je te donnerai mon nom
Pour les hommes que j'ai aimé
Une minute ou une heure
C'est pas ce qui m'a manqué
C'est pas pour ça que je pleure

Qui s'enroule comme un serpent

Je fais des rêves bizarres 
Dans l'ombre grise, mal réveillée 
Je chasse les démons noirs 
Et je pense aux souvenirs 
D'une enfance oubliée 
Où tous les rires, tous les sourires 
Coulaient comme du lait 

C'est bon, c'est toujours bon 
C'est toujours aussi fort 
La vérité d'un souvenir 
C'est qu'il existe encore 
J'ai oublié mes audaces 
Mais mon cœur se rappelle 
La belle confiance déjà tenace 
Que m'inspirait un ciel si lourd 
Si lourd 
Je me souviens d'un vieux bonhomme
Qu'on appelait Plum-Patte 
Qui savait voir dans l'avenir 
Nos vies futures et nos désirs 
Il est mort sans rien nous dire 
On était bien contents 
J'ai pas voulu savoir d'avance 
Le destin qui m'attend 

Ainsi s'en va la vie 
Dans l'air du temps 
Comme par magie 
Tout paraît évident 
Tout vous semble important 

Et le silence dans nos mémoires 
Se brise et disparaît 
Faisant place à un miroir 
Que nul ne voudrait voir en vrai 
Où personne n'oserait se voir 
De peur d'être fané 
La lâcheté de cette histoire 
C'est que tout le monde le sait 

Ainsi s'en va la vie 
Dans l'air du temps 
Et la folie dérive doucement 
Vers un monde évanoui 

Petite, va chercher le pain 
Surtout, ne t'arrête pas en chemin 
Rentre avant la nuit 
Va chercher le vin 
Non, pas chez celui-là, chez l'autre, tu sais bien 
L'école, c'est très bien 
Il faut avoir un bagage en main 
Il y a toujours un espoir 
Et ta mère et moi, pensons l'avoir pour toi 

Ainsi s'en va la vie 
Dans l'air du temps 
Ainsi se rit la vie 

Je m' demande si j'ai raison 
Ou si la folie 
Est entrée dans ma maison 
Comme une litanie 
J' voudrais pas qu'elle vienne maintenant 
Si elle vient vraiment 
Solitude à bon marché 
Faudrait pas rêver 

Après tout, c'est en nous que l'amour est né 
Et c'est en nous qu'il dort 
Il nous a tous hypnotisés 
Et c'est nous qu'il mord 
Avec douceur, avec colère 
Il nous fait faire en l'air 
Tout un tas d' tours imaginaires 
Comme un acrobate 

C'est pas marrant d'être acrobate 
Quand on sait pas voler 
C'est plus facile d'être automate 
Qui peut pas penser 
Qu'on peut casser en mille morceaux 
Et puis tout balayer 
Jeter le tout dans l' caniveau 
Et tout recommencer 

Ainsi s'en va la vie 
Ainsi s'en va le temps 
Et la folie 
Dérive doucement 
Ainsi s'en va la vie 
Ainsi s'en va le temps",Ainsi S'En Va La Vie,2004
Véronique Sanson,"Prends donc le dernier verre de la saison 
Et laisse tous les enfants à la maison 
Reprends ta valise noire 
Et va-t'en par le dernier train du soir 

Je me demande pourquoi t'aimes pas le monde où tu vis 
Pourquoi tu m' fais la gueule sans raison, dis ? 
Avec un homme comme toi 
C'est bien barré pour qu'on en reste là 

Tu dis qu' la vie c'est dur, c'est difficile 
Qu' c'est moi qui m' fous dedans, pauvre imbécile ! 
Je suis sur ta liste noire 
C'est mal barré pour qu'on n'ait pas d'histoire 

Tu m'observes et tu m'espionnes 
Tu m'écoutes toujours quand je téléphone 
Tu critiques mes vieux amours 
Je commence à voir maintenant 
Pourquoi on t'appelle ""Loulou dent-de-loup""
Toujours à soupçonner un mauvais coup 
J' veux pas d'un homme comme toi 
Qui ternirait ma vie, ah, non pas ça ! 

J'aurais tellement pu t'aimer 
Comme jamais on t'aurait aimé 
Être douce comme l'eau 
T'envelopper dans la chaleur de ma peau 
Tout chaud, tout chaud 
Te faire des choses 
Qui t' filent la vie dans le bas du dos 

Te donner des baisers, des baisers 
À faire pâlir tous les badauds 
(Tous les badauds, tous les badauds) 
Avec une femme comme moi 
T'aurais pas vu, la vie, comme elle est noire 

J'aurais tellement pu t'aimer 
Comme jamais on t'aurait aimé 
Être douce comme l'eau

Véronique Sanson,"Les gens que l'on rencontre au hasard des files de fils de
vie
Les gens que l'on vous montre qui seront un jour de vos amis

Méfiez-vous des uns, méfiez-vous des liens qui tournent
autour d'eux
Tranquilles, dangereux, subtils, c'est tellement bien

Dans leur esprit mobile
Ils vous disent que tout va bien, tout est bien quand même
Pour leur amour fragile, vous vendez votre âme pour qu'on
vous aime

Pour faire le plein d'amour, pour quand vous serez sous
terre, aveugles
Livides, tout seuls, hélas, le temps fracasse

Et moi, pour qu'on m'aime, je vendrais mon âme au plus
offrant
Au diable même, s'il rayonnait d'un feu mauvais, tout
douceureux et laid

Et j'ai besoin de vous
J'ai besoin de tous les moments qui vous rendent fous
Mon esprit sentinelle réagit toujours quand on l'appelle

Faire le plein d'amour pour quand je serai sous terre,
aveugle
Livide, toute seule, hélas, le temps vous casse

Moi, pour qu'on m'aime, je vendrais mon âme au plus offrant
Au diable même, s'il rayonnait d'un feu mauvais, tout
douceureux et laid

Et j'ai la musique au moins, c'est tout ce qui me restera
demain
Ci-gît mon destin, brûlé sous ses ailes, vous ne verrez
rien

Car tous nos amours sont comme les falaises qui tombent dans
l'abîme
De lumière sublime, des terres où tout le monde sombre
Où tout le monde tombe",J'Ai La Musique au Moins,2004
Véronique Sanson,"Il a tout ce que j'aime 
Et il a tout compris 
La couleur de ma peine 
Et l'angoisse de mes nuits 
La violence insensée d'un amour ébahi 
Il me donne tout ça 
Comme ça 
D'un seul regard en moi 

Quand je l'ai rencontré, il était misérable 
Avec l'or patiné d'un talent formidable 
Et l'amour desséché d'une épouse pitoyable 
Et d'un seul coup d'œil 
Comme ça 
J'ai tué mon orgueil 

Faut jamais rester de glace 
Quand on sent un signal 
Faut pas rire de la menace 
Qu'engendre un idéal 
Nous, avec nos rêves et nos soupirs 
Avec nos haines et nos plaisirs

Pas de colère 
Pas de peine 
Pas de misère 
Pas de chaînes 
Pas de galère

Pour ça 
Le temps n'existe pas 

Y a pas d'alarme qui sonne en moi 
Ni d'autres faux-semblants 
Mes idées volent bien au-delà 
Et tournent avec le vent 

C'est pas pour rien que j'ai eu tant d'aventures 
Je sais que jamais rien ne dure 
Et c'est comme ça que j'ai forgé mon armure 
Avec le temps et les brûlures 
Et tout l'espoir que j'ai dans l'avenir 
C'est de rester chez moi et d'éviter le pire

Il n'est pas démoli 
Par l'usure de son cœur

Qu'ensemble on pose

Versailles,"Never mind all the things you heard about me
You're never gonna understand it
Every time that I've given you the truth
It's never made a bit of difference

Disappointment takes you
Then the doubt, it breaks you
It's enough to make you cry

Always looking for a sign
Miracles won't change your mind
Tell me how much evidence you need
Turning truth into a lie
Hardened heart and blinded eye
All you need to do is just believe

Never mind what you think that you had seen
It all can change in just a moment
Here before you is all the proof you need
Why can't you ever just believe it?",Believe,2005
Versailles Philharmonic Quintet,"響く足音が離れてゆく
雨は心さえ濡らして
抱えきれない孤独の薔薇を
飾るこの街の片隅に
静けさの中に溺れた
吐息は硝子細工のメロディ
触れたなら崩れ落ちて
あなたには二度と戻れない
愛する人
もしもあなたに出会う事がなければ
この痛みさえも 知らず誰かを
この手で傷つけていた

流れ始めた時間と涙は
硝子細工のメロディ
ひび割れた鏡の中にはもう
この姿さえも映らない
傷だらけの心を隠す
意味などない 見つめて
愛で抱きしめて 壊れ始めた
心が 枯れてゆくまで
一人にしないでくれ
隣で笑ってくれ
夜が明けるまで

過ぎ去った日々を見つめて
その傷に誓いと別れを
共に歩いてゆこう
どんな苦しみも抱きしめて
愛する人
もしもあなたに出会う事がなければ
この温もりさえ 知らなかった
この手で掴みたい...強く
輝く日々 それは
過去ではなく未来にあるはずだから

今こそ交わした約束を

宇宙の誕生 生命の増殖
感情の転生 屈折した愛

そう傷口は時間の歪み 迷宮へ
暗闇の中、光は幾億の出口から
この身体を選び流れ出す
赤い薔薇に姿を変えながら

宿命に呑み込まれて 不条理な風が冷たい
もがくたびに締め付けられて

強く咲き誇る為に きっと私たちは夢を見る
涙流すことさえ 出来ない瞳で

影は牙をむき出しに また無意味な血が流れる
もう見たくない 悲しい顔は

蒼い水晶が見せた 蝶が羽ばたく綺麗な世界
今も信じてるから 覚悟を決めた

I'm going to be every rose for you in eternity
You're going to play
with me for peace in the song

I'm going to be every rose for you in eternity
You're going to play
with me for peace in the song
I'm going to be every rose for you in eternity

無機質な時代の中で 背負うものに恵まれ
厳しくも確かな人生に感謝する

Ah…最後に願い叶うなら
どうかこの声を届けて

なくしたもの 忘れかけた記憶を

思い出すのは二人の出会いと
傷つけたあの夜だけ

We told them ""we gon' make it through""

Lay on your shoulders
Know we friends, but we closer

As many lovers often do 
But who could have ever seen the danger 
I didn't know I'd fall in love with you

You are this lonely picker's daydream 
Like a wish that's wishing to come true 
So Liberty just now I'm waiting 
To share this love song with you 

But do you think about me when you're lying in his bed 
Won't you take the time to explain 
Do you ever think you'd rather be with me instead 
Or do you only think about me when it rains 

We shared some special nights together 
We said we'd watch the morning rise 
But when the sun was all around us 
Wasn't nothing I hadn't seen in your eyes 

I try so hard to keep it hidden 
But I am hurting deep inside 
For every time I've seen you smile 
There are two times that I have cried

I will be waiting underneath the pouring rain",Liberty,1992

He was sitting alone in the rain 
I said hey young man what you doing there 
And he said sir I'm going insane 
He said sir I'm going insane 

You see I love an American beauty 
But nobody here understands 
Then he looked to the sky with resentment in his eyes 
And said Lord why am I in Japan 
Oh Lord why am I in Japan 

Then he told me a story about yesterday 
When he walked in the search of a friend 
But nobody came to his rescue 
And he came to his bitter end 

He pulled me close and said they all stopped and stared 
As I walked down the street all alone 
Nobody knew my name 
Nobody knew my name 

I said young man I know where you're going 
And young man I know where you've been 
For I've been in this land for a lifetime it seems 
And I'm never to come back again 
No I'm never to come back again 

So I turned and I gave him my blessing 
And I left him alone in the rain 
But I had to just stop and laugh at myself

Their fears at home

Said they will always be with us until He comes again
Does that mean we shouldn't try
Should I just lay on down and die

And now His face I see,

Those whose lives have been redeemed,
Broken homes that He has mended,
Those from prison He has freed,
Little children and the aged
Hand in hand stand all aglow,
Who were crippled, broken, ruined,
Clad in garments white as snow.

I can see the marching throng,
The flurry of God's trumpets
Spells the end of sin and wrong:
Regal robes are now unfolding,
Heaven's grandstand's all in place,
Heaven's choir now assembled,
Start to sing ""Amazing Grace!""

I seen you on a movie in my room

Oh Lon Chaney with the velvet touch
Silver dagger and the black man's crutch
Now's the time to come out from your tomb

You look so sad with a face of stone
With a hunchback's eye you live

Oh Lon Chaney with the velvet touch
Gypsy woman that you love so much
Say goodbye, you're cured, you're free at last

Oh Lon Chaney what's to hold you back?
The Wolfman's dead and the old black cat is gone
Like a memory faded from your past

You look so sad with a face of stone
Just skin and bone, you're all alone
With a hunchback's eye you live

Vetiver,"Fucked up and beyond a wreck
Plastered to my bed,nothing daring in me that's left
Just a mutinous protest.
Story's old to the critical fold
You've heard it all before
Nothing new just this little girl,and this is now I'm feeling

Knuckle bashed insomniac,my head takes another spin
Never been aware of the facts,eventual moral switch
Story's old to the critical fold
You've been sold it all before
Laid bare from all that I own and for nothing I could care less

[Chorus]
You stay up all night,to keep my eyes dry
You stay up all night,to make it easy when I cry
You stay up all night,to stop me feeling like I could die
You stay up all night,to be by my side

Fucked up beyond repair
Only fragments in my head,too numb to find a piece of myself
Leave it to someone else,guilty of treating apathy with the greatest empathy
Given up I'm completely carefree,yo I couldn't give a fuck less
and my head feels tight
Like it's gonna burst,and my lungs feel light
so tired of getting burnt
You stay up

We all get a little fucked up sometimes
We all need someone to stay by our side
We all get a little fucked up sometimes
We all need someone to make it easy
When we cry,don't let me go
Don't let me go
Don't let me go
Stay by my side.",Standin',2008

This summer I might have drowned

And a reservoir to boot

At the former I wore my suit

When came moving off the leaves

Where did she go?

Long branches wet
To hide promises
No one would keep
Wanting to catch a glimpse
I ran deep into the woods
Moving across

I was lost

Up ahead I hear her footstep
But I don't see her anywhere
It's not like me to run off and leave the rest behind
My way home

Dejarnos sin ganas de vencer
Fue un atraco perfecto
Fue un golpe maestro 
Quitarnos la sed

Fundieron plomo y cobre
Pusieron sal en sobres
Alerta, hay un testigo
Nos han dejado vivos

Fue un atraco perfecto
Excepto por esto
Nos queda garganta, puño y pies
No fue un golpe maestro
Dejaron un rastro
Ya pueden correr
Ya vuelve la sed",Golpe Maestro,2014
Vetusta Morla,"La misma sed, la misma pared
El mismo folio en blanco
Polvo en flor, el guiño del cursor
Las cartas de amor del banco

Gas letal, carmín para cenar
Vacío en el desayuno

Parece tan oportuno escapar
Parece tan imposible irse sin más

Mientras ese mundo 
Pide a gritos un castigo, un insulto
Una grieta, un vendaval
Un shock profundo
Pide a gritos un final

""Aprenderás"", gritaba el compás 
Marcando con el puño
Un hambre atroz, bombones de licor 
Acechan detrás del humo

Parece tan oportuno escapar
Parece tan imposible irse sin más

Mientras ese mundo 
Pide a gritos un castigo, un insulto
Una grieta, un vendaval
Un shock profundo
Pide a gritos un final

Mientras ese mundo 
Tiembla con un vendaval 
Que fue susurro
Cierra cada grieta de aquel shock profundo
Pide otra oportunidad",La  Grieta,2014
Vetusta Morla,"En la sala de espera 
De estos ojos cerrados 
Hay atada una flor 
A un cordel muy, muy largo

En la sala de espera 
De este otoño sin respiración
Cada rostro es la cruz 
De un pastor sin rebaño

Pasan por aquí, quieren olvidar 
Su condición de marionetas
Un artista más en el Festival de la Paciencia

En las salas de espera 
De entrevistas e infartos
De estaciones ausentes
Nadie es de ningún lado

Pasan por aquí, quieren olvidar 
Su condición de marionetas
Un artista más en el Festival de la Paciencia
Pasan por aquí, van a subastar 
Calma, control y noches en vela
No pueden salir, nadie quiere entrar
No hay ida y vuelta

En la sala de espera 
Ya no hay sillas ni bancos
Sólo hay voces urgentes
Nadie aguarda sentado

Pasan por aquí, van a subastar 
Calma, control y noches en vela
Otro artista más en el Festival de la Paciencia
Pasan por aquí, quieren recordar 
Cómo y por qué se vieron en ésta
No pueden salir, nadie quiere entrar
No hay ida y vuelta",Las Salas de Espera,2014
Vetusta Morla,"¿Qué harías tú si al despertar 
Fuera un insecto en tu pared? 
Algo sutil, gran angular
Que nada cuenta y todo ve

Si al despertar, siguiera allí

¿Qué harías tú pudiendo ser 
La disección de un bisturí? 
Si pudieras rozar 
Antes de prohibir
Los laberintos del jardín

Y si al despertar, siguiera allí
Querrías ver lo que yo vi

Conté hasta tres para escapar
Busqué la estela hasta un altar
Vi discutir al ying y al yang
Apuñalarse por detrás
Y oí gemir y vi llorar 
Como las fiera sin domar
Y justo allí dormías tú
Me susurraste que al despertar, siguiera allí
Para escucharlo todo
Sin confesarte el modo 
De ser testigo en tu festín",La  Mosca en Tu Pared,2014
Vetusta Morla,"No era yo
A quien viste caer no era yo
Fue quizás un reflejo impostor 
El que puso en mi mano el puñal
No era yo, allí había alguien más

En el mismo lugar, flor y metal 
Y un resplandor 
Que se derrama a nuestro alrededor
En el mismo renglón, gozo y dolor 
Pueden gritar
""¡Menos humos y más fuego, más, más, más, más!"" 

No eras tú
Fue tu forma de hacerme caer
Fue tu nombre cantado al revés 
El conjuro que me hizo jurar
Que eras tú, pero había alguien más

En el mismo lugar, hueso y metal 
Y un resplandor
Que se derrama a nuestro alrededor
En el mismo renglón, gozo y dolor 
Pueden gritar
""¡Menos humos y más fuego, más, más, más, más! 

Ya quemé 
Sin piedad 
Los espacios en blanco y después 
No hubo más
Sólo ruido y sudor, sólo paz

En el mismo lugar, carne y metal 
Y un resplandor 
Que se derrama a nuestro alrededor
En el mismo renglón, gozo y dolor 
Pueden gritar: 
""¡Menos humos y más fuego, más, más, más, más!""",Pirómanos,2014
Vetusta Morla,"Dan las seis
Marcos, tazas, café
Niebla en el televisor
Frío en los pies

Diez, dos, cien 
Briznas de polvo lunar 
Cruzan la persiana 
Sin parar 
Su ballet

No volverá
No se fue jamás
Cada recuerdo será 
Un desertor

Quizás un error
Cada pared, un vals
Una sonata fantasma 
Cada espiral
En cada reloj

Duerme un temblor

Ya dan las seis
El café se enfrió
El polvo lunar nos trae 
La última transmisión

Por un segundo fue 
Reina del recital
Vistió la plata otra vez 
Que el tiempo le tejió
Y se abrió un telón 
Desafiando el final 
Y en esa brecha de luz 
Vuelve a bailar 
Vuelve a bailar 
Vuelve a bailar 
Vuelve a reinar",Una Sonata Fantasma,2014
Vetusta Morla,"En la playa y con honores 
Enterramos los relojes
Funeral por el despertador

Luego, en un corcel ciclista 
Damos vueltas a la isla 
Y no hay podio para el vencedor

Escribieron nuestros nombres 
Con brochazos blancos y al revés
Igual que en Tourmalet
Lanzados por un mes, van 

Perdidos en el pelotón
Salvados a contrarreloj
En brazos del sofá, van 
Nadando en contrapedal
Hundidos en la general
Pero a flote

Cromos, naipes, sombras, siestas
Libros viejos y una gesta 
Que se asoma en el televisor

Reinas en el chiringuito 
Miran a un señor bajito 
Que dejó en la arena su maillot

Carne de meta volante
Flota de medusas al sprint
Agosto llega al fin
Septiembre ya está aquí, van 

Perdidos en el pelotón 
Salvados a contrarreloj
En brazos del sofá, van 
Nadando en contrapedal
Hundidos en la general
Pero a flote

Quince eneros después
Ya con julio en ciernes
No dan para más los pies 
Y nos quema un sol ausente, inerte

Mientras van ya 
Bajando el puerto de las tres 
Con diarios del ochenta y seis 
Guardando el pecho, y van, van 
Quedando fuera de control 
Repiten la misma canción 
Sin ver París, y van, y van 

Perdidos en el pelotón 
Salvados a contrarreloj
En brazos del sofá, van 
Nadando en contrapedal
Hundidos en la general
Pero a flote

Antihéroes",Tour de Francia,2014
Vetusta Morla,"Nunca pensé sino en salir
Del mal paso y ponerme a vivir
Como si fuera necesario
Hundido un poco o lo bastante
Me dí un par de años para largarme
¿Y mientras tanto?
El pulso sin descanso
El pulso sin descanso
Planeta-sur
Planeta-sur

Con la música a otra parte
Donde cada instante pase a ser
Una hora sagrada
Con una canción inoportuna
Que nos sirva de vacuna
Mi son medicinal
Y el pulso sin descanso
El pulso sin descanso
Planeta-sur
Planeta-sur

Con tu permiso
(O incluso sin él)
Este es el momento
Aún estamos a tiempo
Con tu permiso
(O incluso sin él)
Este es el momento
Aún estamos a tiempo
El pulso sin descanso
El pulso sin descanso
