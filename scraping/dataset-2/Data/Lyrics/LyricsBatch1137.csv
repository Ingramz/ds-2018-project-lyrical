Billy Eckstine,"When the sun comes out
And that rain stops beatin' on my windowpane
When the sun comes out
There'll be bluebirds 'round my door
Singin' like they did before

That old storm broke out
And my man walked off and left me in the rain
Though he's gone, I doubt
If he'll stay away for good
I'd stop living if he should

Love is funny
It's not always peaches, cream and honey
Just when everything looked bright and sunny
Suddenly the cyclone came
I'll never be the same

Till that sun comes out
And that rain stops beatin' on my windowpane
If my heart holds out
Let it rain and let it pour
It may not be long before
There's a knockin' at my door
Then you'll know the one I love walked in
When the sun comes out",When the Sun Comes Out,1991
Billy Eckstine,"April in Paris, chestnuts in blossom
Holiday tables under the moon
April in Paris, this is a feeling
No one can ever reprise

I never knew the charm of spring
Never met it face to face
I never knew my heart could sing
Never missed a warm embrace, till

April in Paris, whom could I turn to
What have you done to my heart

I never knew the charm of spring
Never met it face to face
I never knew my heart could sing
Never missed a warm embrace, till

April in Paris, whom could I turn to
What have you done to my heart",April in Paris,1991
Billy Eckstine,"As long as I live
You'll always be part of me
You'll live in the heart of me
As long as I live

As long as I love
I'll share it with you, my own
And want to be loved
By you alone

How sure am I
Of all the things I say
As sure as night 
Will fall at close of day

You're all that I need
So answer this love I give
And whisper ""I'm yours""
As long as I live",As Long as I Live,1991
Billy Eckstine,"Bewildered
Lost in a dream of you
Where is the love I knew
Why did we part?

Bewildered
Helpless without you near
Wishing your heart could hear
What's in my heart

Must I have sleepless nights and endless days?
Oh love why did you leave my soul without a spark?
I'm in the dark
Bewildered

I need your guiding hand
I'll never understand
How you could love me, then leave me
Bewildered",Bewildered,1991
Billy Eckstine,"Blue moon you saw me standing alone
Without a dream in my heart
Without a love of my own
Blue moon, you knew just what I was there for
You heard me saying a prayer for 
Someone I really could care for
And then there suddenly appeared before me
The only one my arms will ever hold
I heard somebody whisper ""Please adore me""
And when I looked, the moon had turned to gold!
Blue moon! 
Now I'm no longer alone
Without a dream in my heart
Without a love of my own",Blue Moon,1991
Billy Eckstine,"See that train coming round the bend,
Carrying the one that I love
Her beautiful body is still here on earth,
But her soul has been called up above

Body and soul, body and soul,
That's how she loved me, with body and soul

Her beautiful hair was the purest of gold,
Her eyes were as blue as the sea,
Her lips were the color of summer's red rose,
And she promised she would always love me

Tomorrow as the sun sinks low
The shadows will cover her face
As her last sun goes down, she's laid beneath the ground
And my teardrops are falling like rain",Body and Soul,1991
Billy Eckstine,"Night and stars above that shine so bright 
The myst'ry of their fading light 
That shines upon our caravan 
 
Sleep upon my shoulder as we creep 
Across the sand so I may keep 
The mem'ry of our caravan 
 
This is so exciting 
You are so inviting 
Resting in my arms 
As I thrill to the magic charms 
Of you beside me here beneath the blue 
My dream of love is coming true 
Within our desert caravan",Caravan,1991
Billy Eckstine,"Hear me, why you keep fooling
Little coquette, making fun of the one who loves you
Breaking hearts you are ruling
Little coquette, true hearts tenderly dreaming of you.
Someday you'll fall in love as I fell in love with you.
Maybe the one you love will just be fooling too.
And when you are alone with all your regrets, 
You know, my little coquette, I love you.

Someday you'll fall in love as I fell in love with you.
Now, maybe the one you love will just be fooling too.
And when you are alone with all your regrets,
Now, you know, my little coquette, I love you.",Coquette,1991
Billy Eckstine,"And if I should paint a picture too
That showed the loveliness of you,
My art would be,
Like my heart and me,
Dedicated to you.

To you,
Because your love is the beacon that lights up my way.
To you,
Because with you I know a lifetime could be just one heavenly day.

If I should find a twinkling star,
One half as wondrous as you are,
That star would be
Like my heart and me,
Dedicated to you.

To you,
Because your love is the beacon that lights up my way.
To you,
Because with you I know a lifetime could be just one heavenly day.

If I should find a twinkling star,
One half as wondrous as you are,
That star would be
Like my heart and me,
Dedicated to you.",Dedicated to You,1991
Billy Eckstine,"Missed the Saturday dance
Heard they crowded the floor
Couldn't bear it without you
Don't get around much anymore
 
Though I'd visit the club
Got as far as the door
They'd have asked me about you
Don't get around much anymore
 
Darling, I guess my mind's more at ease
But nevertheless why stir up memories?
 
Been invited on dates
Might have gone but what for?
Awf'lly diff'rent without you
Don't get around much anymore",Don't Get Around Much Anymore,1991
Billy Eckstine,"When an early autumn walks the land and chills the breeze
And touches with her hand the summer trees
Perhaps you'll understand what memories I own
There's a dance pavilion, all shuttered down
A winding country lane, all russet brown
A frosty windowpane shows me a town grown lonely
That spring of ours that started, so April-hearted
Seemed made for just a boy and girl
I never dreamed, did you, any fall could come in view
So early, early
Darling, if you care, please let me know
I'll meet you anywhere, I miss you so
Let's never have to share another early autumn",Early Autumn,1991
Billy Eckstine,"The more I'm with you
The more I can see
My love is yours alone
You came and captured 
A heart that was free
Now there's nothing I can call my own

Everything I have is yours, you're part of me
Everything I have is yours, my destiny
I would gladly give the sun to you
If the sun were only mine
I would gladly give the earth to you
And the stars that shine

Everything that I possess, I offer you
That my dream of happiness come true
I'd be happy just to spend my life
Waiting at your beck and call
Everything I have is yours
My life, my all

Everything that I possess, I offer you
That my dream of happiness come true
I'd be happy just to spend my life
Waiting at your beck and call
Everything I have is yours
My life, my all",Everything I Have Is Yours,1991
Billy Eckstine,"""Romance is a game for fools""
I used to say
A game I thought I'd never play
""Romance is a game for fools""
I said and grinned
Then you passed by
And here am I
Throwing caution to the wind

Fools rush in where angels fear to tread
And so I come to you, my love, my heart above my head.
Though I see the danger there
If there's a chance for me, then I don't care

Mm-mm-mm-mm
Fools rush in where wise men never go
But wise men never fall in love, so how are they to know?
When we met, I felt my life begin
So open up your heart and let this fool rush in

Fools rush in where wise men never, never, never go
Eh, but wise men never fall in love, so how are they to know?
Ahh, when we met, girl, I felt my life begin
So open up your heart and let this fool rush in

Just open up your heart and let this fool rush on in
Just open up your heart because I-I-I-I-I-I-I am coming in
Open up your heart and let this fool rush in!!",Fools Rush In,1991
Billy Eckstine,"Monday is shining
You know 'em Tuesday's rain
Well, the days go by me
Like a southbound train
Yes, it's funny thinking
You will never call my name
Here comes long lonely
Here comes the blues
Well, the world's the same old comedy

You know my time is cold
Nothing new, blue lady
I won't get old
Cause the deal is gone now
I'd just better hold
Here comes long lonely
Here comes the blues
Well, sun has run down
She has gone out to hide
Yes, and now I'm out walking
Where the midnight ride
Just me and the good-time Charlies

And the suicide
Here comes long lonely
Here comes the blues
Well, Monday's dry
Yes, and Tuesday's just the same
Maybe come down blue Wednesday
I'm gonna grab the brakes again

Cause no bottle of pills
Could ever kill this pain
Here comes long lonely
Here comes the blues
Here comes long lonely
Here comes the blues",Here Comes the Blues,1991
Billy Eckstine,"I left my hat in Haiti
In some forgotten flat in Haiti
I couldn't tell you how I got there
I only know it was so hot there

She took my hat politely
And wound her arms around me tightly
But I remember nothing clearly
Except the flame when she came near me

Her eyes had the glow of surrender
And her touch it was tender
And with someone as fiery as that
You forget about your hat

So if you go to Haiti
There is a girl I know in Haiti
If you can find her you'll adore her
Just look around till you've found someone who has a blue-grey fedora

Her eyes had the glow of surrender
And her touch it was tender
And with someone as fiery as that
You forget about your hat

So if you go to Haiti
There is a girl I know in Haiti
If you can find her you'll adore her
Just look around till you've found someone who has a blue-grey fedora",I Left My Hat in Haiti,1991
Billy Eckstine,"I love you
Hums the April breeze
I love you
Echo the hills

I love you
The golden dawn agrees
As once more she sees
Daffodils

It's spring again
And birds on the wing again
Start to sing again
The old melody

I love you
That's the song of songs
And it all belongs
To you and me

It's spring again
And birds on the wing again
Start to sing again
The old melody

I love you
That's the song of songs
And it all belongs
To you and me

I love you
I love you
I love you
I love you",I Love You,1991
Billy Eckstine,"I want to be loved with inspiration
I want to be loved starting tonight
Instead of merely holding conversation
Hold me tight

I want to be kissed until I tingle
I want to be kissed starting tonight
Embrace until our heartbeats intermingle
Wrong or right

I feel like acting my age
I'm past the stage of merely turtle doving
(Be careful, be careful what you do)
I'm in no mood to resist
And I insist the world owes me a loving

I want to be thrilled to desperation
I want to be thrilled starting tonight
(Love me, love me, love me)
With every kind of wonderful sensation
I want to be loved

I feel like acting my age
I'm past the stage of merely turtle doving
I'm in no mood to resist
And I insist the world owes me a loving

I want to be thrilled to desperation
I want to be thrilled starting tonight
With every kind of wonderful sensation
I want to be loved",I Wanna Be Loved,1991
Billy Eckstine,"I'm a fool to want you
I'm a fool to want you
To want a love that can't be true
A love that's there for others too

I'm a fool to hold you
Such a fool to hold you
To seek a kiss not mine alone
To share a kiss the Devil has known

Time and time again I said I'd leave you
Time and time again I went away
But then would come the time when I would need you
And once again these words I'd have to say

I'm a fool to want you
Pity me, I need you
I know it's wrong, it must be wrong
But right or wrong I can't get along
Without you

Time and time again I said I'd leave you
Time and time again I went away
But then would come the time when I would need you
And once again these words I'd have to say

Take me back, I love you
Pity me, I need you
I know it's wrong, it must be wrong
But right or wrong I can't get along

Without you",I'm a Fool to Want You,1991
Billy Eckstine,"If you could see me now, you'd know how blue I've been
One look is all you'd need to see the mood I'm in.
Perhaps then you'd realize I'm still in love with you.
If you could see me now, you'd find me being brave
And trying awfully hard to make my tears behave
But that's quite impossible, I'm still in love with you.
 
You'll happen my way on some mem'rable day
And the month will be May for a while.
I'll try to smile but can I play the part
Without my heart behind the smile?
 
The way I feel for you I never could disguise
The look of love is written plainly in my eyes.
I think you'd be mine again if you could see me now.",If You Could See Me Now,1991
Billy Eckstine,"Blow ill wind, blow away
Let me rest today
You're blowin' me no good, no good

Go ill wind, go away
Skies are oh, so grey
Around my neighborhood, and that's no good

You're only misleadin' the sunshine I'm needin'
Ain't that a shame
It's so hard to keep up with troubles that creep up
From out of nowhere, when love's to blame

So, ill wind, blow away
Let me rest today
You're blowin' me no good, no good

So, ill wind, blow away
Let me rest today
You're blowin' me no good, no good",Ill Wind,1991
Billy Eckstine,"You know the feeling of something half remembered
Of something that never happened, yet you recall it well
You know the feeling of recognizing someone
That you've never met as far as you could tell, well

Laura is the face in the misty light
Footsteps that you hear down the hall
The laugh that floats on a summer night
That you can never quite recall
And you see Laura on the train that is passing through
Those eyes, how familiar they seem
She gave your very first kiss to you
That was Laura but she's only a dream",Laura,1991
Billy Eckstine,"People are queer, they're always crowing, scrambling and rushing about
Why don't they stop someday, address themselves this way?
Why are we here? Where are we going? It's time that we found out
We're not here to stay; we're on a short holiday

Life is just a bowl of cherries
Don't take it serious; it's too mysterious
You work, you save, you worry so
But you can't take your dough when you go, go, go

So keep repeating it's the berries
The strongest oak must fall
The sweet things in life, to you were just loaned
So how can you lose what you've never owned?
Life is just a bowl of cherries
So live and laugh at it all

Life is just a bowl of cherries
Don't take it serious; it's too mysterious
At eight each morning I have got a date
To take my plunge 'round the Empire State
You'll admit it's not the berries
In a building that's so tall
There's a guy in the show, the girls love to kiss
Get thousands a week just for crooning like this
Life is just a bowl of, aw, nuts!
So live and laugh at it all!",Life Is Just a Bowl of Cherries,1991
Billy Eckstine,"What a thrill you are,
What a sight to see,
Something the eyes of mortals have no right to see.
Am I on the earth or in the sky?

Lost in loveliness am I.
When I look at you,
I forget myself,
I could go mad about you if I let myself.

Should I let myself, or pass you by?
Lost in loveliness am I.
I know I'm reaching for a star,
What's more, I know how dangerous you are.

If I were wise
I'd close my eyes
Or walk away and worship from afar.
In the lonely night,

You would haunt my heart,
And I would pray that someday you might want my heart.
And I'd have to live my whole life through
Lost in loveliness, the loveliness of you.",Lost in Loveliness,1991
Billy Eckstine,"The night is like a lovely tune, beware my foolish heart
How white the ever constant moon, take care, my foolish heart

There's a line between love and fascination
That's hard to see on an evening such as this
For they give the very same sensation
When you are lost in the passion of a kiss
Your lips are much too close to mine, beware my foolish heart

But should our eager lips combine, then let the fire start
For this time it isn't fascination, or a dream that will fade and fall apart
It's love this time, it's love, my foolish heart",My Foolish Heart,1991
Billy Eckstine,"We seem like passing strangers now
How can you hurry by
There were never two who loved
Half as much as you and I

We seem like passing strangers now
Funny how things can change
We were so inseparable
Now you're acting very strange

The hands I used to touch
Don't even wave hello
How I miss your lips
You'll never know

If you would only turn to me
Speak my name just once more
You might find right there and then
Strangers can be lovers again

The hands I used to touch
Don't even wave hello
How I miss your lips
You'll never know

If you would only turn to me
Speak my name just once more
You might find right there and then
Strangers can be lovers again",Passing Strangers,1991
Billy Eckstine,"They asked me how I knew my true love was true
I of course replied ""something here inside cannot be denied""
They said ""someday you'll find all who love are blind""
When your heart's on fire, you must realize smoke gets in your eyes
So I chaffed them and I gaily laughed to think they could doubt my love
Yet today my love has flown away, I am without my love

Now laughing friends deride tears I cannot hide
So I smile and say ""when a lovely flame dies, smoke gets in your eyes""

(Smoke gets in your eyes, smoke gets in your eyes)

Smoke gets in your eyes",Smoke Gets in Your Eyes,1991
Billy Eckstine,"Here I go again, I hear those trumpets blow again.
All aglow again, takin' a chance on love.
Here I slide again, about to take that ride again.
Starry-eyed again, takin' a chance on love.

I thought that cards were a frame-up, I never would try.
Now I'm taking that game up and the ace of hearts is high.
Things are mending now, I see a rainbow blending now.
We'll have a happy ending now, takin' a chance on love.

Here I slip again, about to take that trip again.
I got that grip again, takin' a chance on love.
Now I prove again that I can make life move again.
Um - I'm in the groove again, takin' a chance on love.

I walk around with a horse shoe, in clover I lie.
And brother rabbit of course you better kiss your, foot good-bye.
On that ball again I'm ridin' for a fall again.
I'm gonna give my all again takin' a chance on love.",Taking a Chance on Love,1991
Billy Eckstine,"You came, I was alone
I should have known you were temptation
You smiled, luring me on
My heart was gone, you were temptation
It would be thrilling 
If you were willing
If it can never be
Pity me for you are temptation and I am yours

Here is my heart, take it and say
We'll never part
I'm just a slave
Only a slave to you, temptation
You were born to be kissed
I can't resist.

You are temptation and I am yours
Here is my heart, take it and say
We'll never part
I'm just a slave
Only a slave to you, temptation",Temptation,1991
Billy Eckstine,"The evening breeze caressed the trees tenderly
The trembling trees embraced the breeze tenderly
Then you and I came wandering by
And lost in a sigh were we
The shore was kissed by sea and mist tenderly
I can't forget how two hearts met breathlessly
Your arms opened wide and closed me inside
You took my lips, you took my love so tenderly",Tenderly,1991
Billy Eckstine,"I used to dream of gold and glory
Just like a lot of people do
But since you taught me love's old story
I only dream of you

You're All I Need my wonderful one
You're All I Need my starlight and sun
A friend to walk beside me
A loving hand to guide me
A tender evening song when day is done

You're All I Need for you're heaven sent
You're All I Need to bring me contentment
The world is mine for you are mine
I'm rich indeed 
You're All I Need
",You're All I Need,1991
Billy Eckstine,"You left me sad and lonely; 
Why did you leave me lonely? 
For here's a heart that's only 
For nobody but you!
  
I'm burning like a flame, dear; 
Oh, I'll never be the same, dear; 
I'll always place the blame, dear, 
On nobody but you.
 
Yes, you, 
You're driving me crazy! 
What did I do? What did I do? 
My tears for you 
Make everything hazy, 
Clouding the skies of blue. 
 
How true, 
Were the friends who were near me to cheer me, 
Believe me, they knew! 
But you, 
Were the kind who would hurt me, desert me, 
When I needed you!
 
Yes, you! 
You're driving me crazy! 
What did I do to you?",You're Driving Me Crazy (What Did I Do?),1991
Billy Eckstine,"You've got me crying again
You've got me sighing again
What is this love all about?
I'm in, I'm out
Your kisses right from the start
Came from your lips, not your heart
You make me happy and then
Somebody new looks good to you
You've got me crying again
Just crying for you",You've Got Me Crying Again,1991
Billy Eckstine,"The weather is frightening.
The thunder and lightning
Seem to be having their way.
But as far as I'm concerned, it's a lovely day. 
The turn in the weather
Will keep us together
So I can honestly say,
That as far as I'm concerned, it's a lovely day...
And everything's okay.

Isn't this a lovely day to be caught in the rain.
You were going on your way, now you've got to remain.

Just as you were going, leaving me all at sea,
The clouds broke, they broke and oh what a break for me.

I can see the sun up high, though we're caught in a storm.
I can see where you and I could be cozy and warm.

Let the rain pitter patter
But it really doesn't matter 
If the skies are gray.
Long as I can be with you, it's a lovely day.",Isn't This a Lovely Day,1991
Billy Eckstine,"If I told a lie, if I made you cry
When I said goodbye, I'm sorry
From the bottom of my heart, dear
I apologize
If I caused you pain, I know I'm to blame
Must have been insane, believe me
From the bottom of my heart, dear
I apologize
I realize I've been unfair to you
Please let me make amends
Don't say that you forgot the love we knew
After all, we were more than friends
If I made you blue, I've had heartaches too
Now I beg of you, forgive me
From the bottom of my heart, dear
I apologize
Give me back your glance, give me back romance
Give me one more chance, forgive me
From the bottom of my heart, dear
I apologize",I Apologize,1992
Billy Eckstine,"In a Sentimental Mood I can see
The stars come through my room
While your loving attitude is
Like a flame that lights the gloom
On the wings of ev'ry kiss
Drift a melody so strange and sweet
In this sentimental bliss you make
My Paradise complete
Rose pearls seem to fall
It's all like a dream to call you mine

Billy Eckstine,"Skylark
Have you anything to say to me?
Won't you tell me where my love can be?
Is there a meadow in the mist
Where someone's waiting to be kissed?

Skylark
Have you seen a valley green with spring?
Where my heart can go a journeying
Over the shadows and the rain
To a blossom covered lane

And in your lonely flight
Haven't you heard the music of the night?
Wonderful music
Faint as a will o' the wisp
Crazy as a loon
Sad as a gypsy serenading the moon

Skylark
I don't know if you can find these things
But my heart is riding on your wings
So if you see them anywhere
Won't you lead me there

Billy Eckstine,"I'd like to get away, Junior
Somewhere alone with you
It could be oh, so gay, Junior
You need a laugh
Or two

A certain place I know, Frankie
Where funny people can have fun
That's where the two will go,
Darling

Before you can count up
One, two, three. 
For there's a small hotel
With a wishing well

I wish that we were there together
There's a bridal suite
One room bright and neat
Complete for us to
Share together

Looking through the window
You can see a distant steeple
Not a sign of people who
Wants people?
When the steeple bell says,
""Good night, sleep well,""
We'll thank the small hotel
Together

Billy Eckstine,"In the still of the night
As I gaze out of my window
At the moon in it's flight
My thoughts all stray, stray to you

In the still of the night
While the world lies in slumber
Oh the times without number
When I say to you

Do you love me
Just like I love you
Are you my life to be
That dream come true
Or will this dream of mine
Will it fade way out of sight

Billy Eckstine,"I never cared much for moonlit skies
I never wink back at fireflies
But now that the stars are in your eyes

Or candlelight on the mistletoe
But now when you turn the lamp down low
I'm beginning to see the light

Used to ramble through the park
Shadowboxing in the dark
Then you came and caused a spark
That's a four-alarm fire now

I never saw rainbows in my wine
But now that your lips are burning mine
I'm beginning to see the light",I'm Beginning to See the Light,1994

Down and down I go
Round and round I go
Like a leaf caught in a tide
I should stay away but what can I do 
I hear your name and I'm a flame

Flame, flame of desire

Would it be wrong to kiss
Seeing I feel like this
Would it be wrong to try?

A beautiful theme of every
Dream I ever knew.
Down deep in my heart I hear it play.
I feel it start, then melt away.

I hear music when I touch your hand,
A beautiful melody
From some enchanted land.
Down deep in my heart, I hear it say,
Is this the day?

I alone have heard this lovely strain,
I alone have heard this glad refrain,
Must it be forever inside of me,
Why can't I let it go,
Why can't I let you know,
Why can't I let you know the song

Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb
Always reminding me that we're apart
You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms

Tells his fairytale
Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain
My stardust melody
The memory of love's refrain.",Stardust,1994

A girl with sweet talk from Kansas City 
Her words were sweet like wine 
She bought him diamonds and limousines 
She stole that man o' mine 

When night comes a-creepin' 
For me there's no sleeping

I sometimes wonder if this spell that I'm under
Can be only a melody, for I know no one but me
Has won your heart, but when the music starts

My peace departs from the moment
They play that lovely strain
And we surrender to all it's charm again
This jealousy that tortures me is ecstasy, mystery, pain

We dance to a tango of love
Your heart beats with mine as we sway
Your eyes give the answer I'm dreaming of
That soft word your cruel lips will never say

I fear that the music will end
And shatter the spell it may lend
To make me believe when your eyes just deceive
And it's only the tango that you love",Jealousy,1994

I must go on, I'm on this road of no returning

My whole world crashes without your kiss of fire

I can't resist you, what good is there in trying?
What good is there denying you're all that I desire?

I hear you say forever more

Billy Eckstine,"When the day fades away into twilight
The moon is my light of love
In the night, I am quite a romancer
I find an answer above
To being me consolation, you're my inspiration
This is my imagination.

Time on my hands, you in my arms
Nothing but love in view, then you fall
Once and for all, I'll see my dreams come true
Moments to spare for someone you care for
Our love affair for two
With time on my hands and you in my arms
And love in my heart all for you.","Time on My Hands [October 06, 1946]",1998
Billy Eckstine,"Oh, I went down to Tennessee
Yes, I went down to Tennessee
What did I see in Tennessee?
I saw a place where dancers meet
I swear I saw the dancingest feet
You never heard a wilder beat

They were doing the Tennessee Rock 'n' Roll
They were doing the Tennessee Rock 'n' Roll
Upon my soul, the Tennessee Rock 'n' Roll

The caller called: ""Let's promenade!""
The fiddling man looked gone as he played
The old square dance had been remade

They were doing the Tennessee Rock 'n' Roll
They were doing the Tennessee Rock 'n' Roll
Upon my soul, the Tennessee Rock 'n' Roll

Then all at once, before I knew
I joined in with the Hullaballoo
I dug the beat and did it too

I was doing the Tennessee Rock 'n' Roll
I was doing the Tennessee Rock 'n' Roll
Upon my soul, the Tennessee Rock 'n' Roll

Billy Eckstine,"When I hear that Serenade in blue
I'm somewhere in another world, alone with you
Sharing all the joys we used to know
Many moons ago

Once again your face comes back to me
Just like the theme of some forgotten melody
In the album of my memory
Serenade in blue

It seems like only yesterday
The small cafe, a crowded floor
And as we danced the night away
I hear you say forever more
And then the song became a sigh
Forever more became goodbye
Cause you remained in my heart, but

Tell me darling in there still a spark?
Or only lonely ashes of the flame we knew
Should I go on whistling in the dark,
Serenade in blue",Blue,1999
Billy Eckstine,"Sunday is gloomy, my hours are slumberless
Dearest the shadows I live with are numberless
Little white flowers will never awaken you
Not where the black coach of sorrow has taken you
Angels have no thought of ever returning you
Would they be angry if I thought of joining you?

Gloomy Sunday

Gloomy is Sunday, with shadows I spend it all
My heart and I have decided to end it all
Soon there'll be candles and prayers that are sad I know
Let them not weep let them know that I'm glad to go
Death is no dream for in death I'm caressing you
With the last breath of my soul I'll be blessing you

Gloomy Sunday

Dreaming, I was only dreaming
I wake and I find you asleep in the deep of my heart, here
Darling, I hope that my dream never haunted you
My heart is telling you how much I wanted you

Billy Eckstine,"No one but you could take my heart before you came
No one but you could make my heart burst into flame
Now I hear myself confessing
All the dreams I've been suppressing
All at once my lips are blessing your name

Your hands are cool, your eyes are warm
Your smile is bliss
I'd be a fool to fear the storm that's in your kiss
Let your kiss destroy or save me, so shall it be
Till life is through, no one but you for me",No One But You,2000
Billy Eckstine,"Pride, sad, splendid liar,  
Sworn enemy of love
Kept my lips from saying
Things I was thinking of.
But now my pride you've humbled,
I've cast it to the winds,
Broken, beaten, sick at heart
My confession begins.
 
We've played the game of stay away
But it cost more that I can pay.
Without you I can't make my way,
I surrender, dear.

I may seem proud, I may act gay,
It's just a pose, I'm not that way,
'Cause deep down in my heart I say
I surrender, dear.

Little mean things we were doing
Must have been part of the game,
Lending a spice to the wooing,
But I don't care who's to blame.
When stars appear and shadows fall,
Why then you'll hear My poor heart call,
To you my love, my life, my all

He held all the stars in the palm of his hand
And they ran through his fingers like grains of sand
And one little star fell alone

Then the Lord God hunted through the wide night air 
For the little dark star on the wind down there 
And he stated and promised he'd take special care 
So it wouldn't get lost again

Now a man don't mind if the stars grow dim 
And the clouds blow over and darken him
So long as the Lord God's watching over them
Keeping track of how it all goes on

But I've been walking all the night and the day
Till my eyes get weary and my head turns gray
And sometimes it seems maybe God's gone away
And we're lost out here in the stars

Little stars, big stars, blowing through the night
And we're lost out here in the stars
Little stars, big stars, blowing through the night
And we're lost out here in the stars",Lost in the Stars,2004
Billy Eckstine,"[Chorus]
Oh, how happy
You have made me
Oh, how happy
You have made me

I have kissed your lips a thousand times
And more times than I can count I have called you mine
You have stood by me in my darkest hour, and

In our years together, we have had stormy weather
But our love has been so strong that somehow we've carried on

For hummingbirds and butterflies
For tender words that harmonize with love

A time for climbing hills

A time for rainbow coloured weather
A time of make believe that we've been dreaming of

Billy Eckstine,"She's a babe
Just a babe
Still cavorting in her crib
Eating breakfast with a bib

With her baby teeth 
And all her baby curls
She's a tot
Just a tot

Good for bouncing on your knee
I am positive that she
Doesn't even know that boys aren't girls
She's a snip
Just a snip

Making dreadful baby noise
Having fun with all her toys
Just a chickadee who needs a mother hen
She's a cub, a papoose

You could never turn her loose
She's too infantile to take her from her pen
Of course, that weekend in Trouville
In spite of all her youthful zeal

She was exceedingly polite
And on the whole a sheer delight
And if it wasn't joy galore
At least not once was she a bore,

That I recall
No, not at all
Ah! She's a child
A silly child

Adolescent to her toes
And good heaven how it shows
Sticky thumbs are all the fingers she has got
She's a child

A clumsy child
She's as swollen as a grape
And she doesn't have a shape
Where her figure ought to be,

It is not!
Just a child
A growing child
That's so backward for her years

If a boy her age appears
I am certain he will never call again!
She's a scamp and a brat
Doesn't know where she is at

Unequipped and undesirable to men
Of course, I must confess
That in that brand new little dress
She looked surprisingly mature

And had a definite allure
It was a shock in fact to me
The most amazing shock to see
The way it clung

On one, so young!
She's a girl,
A little girl!
Getting older, it is true

Which is what they always do
Till that unexpected hour
When they blossom like a flower!
Oh no (2x)

But...but,
There's sweeter music when she speaks
Isn't there?
Could I be wrong?

Could it be so?
Oh where, oh where
Did Gigi go?
Gigi! Am I a fool without a mind

Or have I merely been too blind to realise?
Oh Gigi! Why you've been growing up before my very eyes
Gigi! You're not at all
That funny, awkward little girl, I knew

Oh no! Over night there's been a breathless change in you
Chorus Verse:
Oh Gigi! While you were trembling on the brink
Was I out yonder somewhere blinking at a star?

Oh Gigi! Have I been standing up too close 
Or back too far?
When did your sparkle turn to fire?
And your warmth become desire?

Oh what miracle has made you the way you are?
Gigi! (3x)
Oh no! I was mad not to have seen the change in you
Oh Gigi!",Gigi [From the Film gigi],2008

I would hum a happy tune
Peeping through the quarter moon

It was in that quiet spot
Daily cares could be forgot
It gave the same relief
To rich and poor

Now it was not a castle fair
But I could dream my future there
And build my castles to
The yellowjacket's drone

I could orbit around the sun
Fight with General Washington
Or be a King upon a golden throne

So beats my heart for you, dear
So beats my heart for you

As beats a melody that Ella hums
So beats my heart for you
Just as exciting as the bongo drums
So beats my heart for you

With you standing there
I'm walking on air
Fell debonair
Just like Fred Astaire

As beats the drummer swinging in a band
So beats my heart for you

Just like the beat of the tom toms
The crashes of cymbals and such
Here is my heart and its pounding
Oh baby I love you so much

So beats my heart
So beats my heart
So beats my heart for you",So Beats My Heart For You,2007

Oh boy, ooh boy
Lately our songs had too many words to sing
Oh boy, ooh boy
It took all the strength from my knees to walk up the steps

It took all the courage I had to knock on the door
Oh boy
My heart was racing, the door opened so slow
I should hve run, but how could I go
All she had on was the radio-boy
Ooh boy
Without a word she called me in
Oh boy, ooh boy
Just one little step for me a chasm to span
Oh boy, ooh boy
We started dancing, God I couldn't believe how she felt
Oh boy
Rollin' and tumblin', fumblin' for my buttons and belt
The music was playing so soft and low
I should have run, but how could I go
All she had on was the radio-boy, ooh boy
Kisses like cherries put wings on my pain
Love coming down like sunshine on sugar cane
It took all the strength from my knees to walk up the steps
I took all the courage I had to knock on the door

It didn't look good
For my brothers and me
There were 24 hours on that longest day
now ten thousand crosses
Scar the beach where they lay
Under machine gun fire
On that blood day called D
Back home a young girl was praying
God bring him home for me

When you reach out
And nobody's there
Scream and shout
No one seems to care
When you think you've got nothing left to hold on to
When you cry out
And nobody hears
Just fear and doubt
All you've left is tears
When you think
You've got nothing left to hold on to
You've still got a prayer
When my mother was born
On that South Brooklyn street
It didn't look good
For my brothers and me
Born in the back of a store
That sold cigars and candy
Cold she lay crying
And that's the way it would be

She took her last breath
And I kissed her goodbye
Walked down that hospital hall
Trying so hard not to cry

For my brothers and me

I gently kiss her lips, touch her with my finger tips
Searching for the love I miss, you once gave to me
She is warm here by my side, I should be satisfied
It's sad to realise I'm still in love with you

'Cause I'm chained to your memory
Tied and bound, I can't get free
There's got to be another love for me
There's got to be someone to set me free

She holds me close to her, I love the sweet things she whispers
But only my memory stirs, my heart still isn't free

'Cause I'm chained to your memory
Tied and bound, I can't get free
There's got to be another love for me

Let's talk about hearts, no two are the same
Some of them are cold as ice, others need the flame
One of them gets comfortable, the other needs a change

But hearts like yours and mine, hearts like yours and mine
Hearts like yours and mine, take pleasure in the pain

Some hearts break too easily, some are hard as stone
One heart cries for company, the other cries alone
Other loves can walk away, but still our hearts remain

'Cause hearts like yours and mine, hearts like yours and mine
Hearts like yours and mine, take pleasure in the pain

There's pleasure in the pain, sunlight through the rain, daylight through the dark
And 'though we know the hurt, we know how much it's worth to stay here where we are

Other loves can walk away, but still our hearts remain

'Cause hearts like yours and mine, hearts like yours and mine
Hearts like yours and mine, take pleasure in the pain

There's pleasure in the pain, sunlight through the rain, daylight through the dark
And 'though we know the hurt, we know how much it's worth to stay here where we are

Hearts like yours and mine
Hearts like yours and mine

There's hearts like yours and there's hearts like mine

Baby I'm your loveline
Oooh, Baby I'm your lifeline
Baby I'm your loveline
Oooh, Baby I'm your lifeline.......
