DNCE,"Before I was born, late one night
My papa said everything's alright
The doctor paid when Ma lay down
With her stomach bouncing all around
Cause the beebop stork was about to arrive
Mama gave birth to the hand-jive

I could barely walk when I milked a cow
When I was three I pushed a plow
While chopping wood I moved my legs
I started dancing when I gathered eggs
The townfolk clapped, I was only five
He'll out dance 'em all, he's born to hand-jive
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, everybody
Born to hand-jive, baby
Born to hand-jive, baby

DNCE,"You must understand how the touch of your hand
Makes my pulse react
That it's only the thrill of boy meeting girl
Opposites attract
It's physical
Only logical
You must try to ignore that it means more than that

What's love got to do, got to do with it?
What's love but a second hand emotion?
What's love got to do, got to do with it?
Who needs a heart when a heart can be broken?

It may seem to you that I'm acting confused
When you're close to me
If I tend to look dazed I've read it someplace
I've got a cause to be
There's a name for it
There's a phrase that fits
But whatever the reason you do it for me 

Oh oh what's love got to do, got to do with it?
What's love but a second hand emotion?
What's love got to do, got to do with it?
Who needs a heart when a heart can be broken?

Oh yeah, yeah ah ah
I've been taking on a new direction
But I have to say
I've been thinking 'bout my own protection
But it scares me to feel this way, oh

What's love got to do, got to do with it?
What's love but a second hand emotion?
What's love got to do, got to do with it?
Who needs a heart when a heart can be broken?
What's love got to do, got to do with it?
What's love but a sweet old fashioned notion?
What's love got to do, got to do with it?
Who needs a heart when a heart can be broken?

You weren't making that much sense

You said you wanna die
Now you say you wanna live
You said you loved me after forty five minutes
If this is all a game can you just say it is?
I'll do it anyway, so it makes no difference

We should order up
Wash the wine out of the coffee cup
They got bread and fruit, there's probably
Not much else for you
We can lay around, you can kiss me
'Til the maids come kick us out

It's eleven now so make every second count
But back in New York they can't ever find this out
There are things we do, that we're really not allowed
We can say anything but we just can't say it loud

I hope you always find someone to take you home

Make sure you're still breathing with their hand up to your nose
I wish that could be me but it's just not possible

All we murder and confetti
Our science in the holy ghost
The space between is spread and getting strong
Distance only grows so don't be long

Count the seconds up for me

That it's dumb luck that got you here
Don't fool yourself
Misfortunes waiting for the best time to appear
To make it clear
That all the courage and the talent that you had
Was just in dreams
And when you wake up
You will beg to get it back
To get it back

You interest your friends
They will betray you
With the love that's blinding
And then at the end they may admit
That you were missing something
And no one remembers even one word that left your mouth
All the melodies were stolen
From songs by someone else

You're out of time
And inspiration filled with self-pity and fear
And all the dreams that haven't dried up
Are slowly drowning in your tears
In your tears

Just don't forget
That it's dumb luck that got you here
Don't fool yourself

Dntel,"The other night, a firefight
Bursts of sewing machine gun fire
From your position
Barricaded behind the piano

I return with small arms
Stuttered shots from typewriter keys

And yet in the silence
Between the volley
The hearts of weary camps
Sing to each other

""However faintly
As we each seek to claim
Disputed territory""

The us beneath the other
The us beneath the other
The us beneath the other
The us beneath the other

The us beneath the other
Which is rich

Subtracting niggaz ? I'm about to figure ? who react with triggers

You finst to go ? you bitches know ? tamper with a nigga ? jag off
In the lead off ? get you blast off ? in a Red Cross ? hit the Feds off
Cause your heads off ? looking for the head bone ? stepping over boundaries

Verse One:

I need...mo money mo money mo, suck 'em fast suck 'em slow
Even though I gotta pay my bills I'm still on the streets
tryin' to keep it real
Pass that shit let me take a hit, hopin' this money ain't
counterfeit
Give 'em 211 get 'em in line and let 'em 20 so(?)
Cut that money let's be up, which you want to ride, the
Benz or the Truck
Back up, get on the one way 'cause more Sundays hotter than Monday
Often gettin' trailed by cops, gotta get away by hittin them blocks
Got my glock, never stick middle finger up my ass, known to blast
Keep me down, where I'm from I'm known to clown
Get a dub off a nine, go get a sack, I'm back, pro black
achiever, leave her, thug and ashtray
More to the fact I'm back to the scene, let in the wonder
let all the smoke out
And if Luke coulda broke out
Gotta make more stacks of these, so I Z's for bud in
the breeze, ain't spittin' cheese

Boy better figure if you owe them, better low then
With po-po corruption on the phone double 1-9-1-87, with
a couple of zeros
I'm sittin' there makin' dollars
Verse 2 G, nigga didn't want to holler
Back to the streets again, but a nigga want to go there
The game treatment so fair
Crucial, in neutral, all eyes on me I'm brutal, choppin'

O.G.s in my house me in the clause
Nigga want cheese, nigga want more
Bumpin' all the good shit 'cause all the good shit makes

Now you make a nigga match wits
Never want what I never had, 'cause I never had shit

want my apology
And they fall, see it's unexplainable how money's unattainable

Never relax, realize don't give a one-too-many free packs
Come check your ho to see I'm a G

Much love to thugs who sacrifice their life to get greens
for the troop of 15, what the shit mean?
It's you bitch, you better save your breath, 'cause you

You tell em this it's you that got to pay the price
So save your life you got a betta chance to relocate
Make one mistake Ima send you to that resting place
Start having bad dreams waking up in the mad scenes
Fuck with this killa I don't think you know what it means
This shit I die for shit I make you cry for
He ain't such you shit but it's the same nigga you lied for
Ain't this some shit took ya life with 4 rounds

Some bitch be claiming sex
Now striping em down with shit to do for niggas
You can't be ture with a nigga so what you do for niggas is come clean
And I'll be flipping through the bud and holsters
Search all the working with all with working with no love and pop that ass with one slug, ugh
It's getting outta hand 'cause you fucking with some idle I'll have it all
So that they ready to fall and put some names across the wall
How do it feel when you fucking with those veterans
They told the men shut down his body now we back again
With about 10 plates to make you vomit in your own hands
You and all men momma say stay outta the business of grown man
The choice was yours and now your zero in 4 days
Got nigga from the old days who kill in cold ways
We giving em work and now they want to bring it to the tape
Mothafuck your name mothafuck your reputation
Now what you in is a lot of bullshit
Got nigga running around like cheated with 9 millimeters and a full clip, ugh

From the hollow point tips
Cepts it looks like hell
Three point five million 
From those narcotic sells
Gang signs that's maile
Seventy two hours incarcerated
All because my hood floss bloody body's
On the pavement
That playa hater shit
Is what brings that type of drama
What a nigga need to start doin'
Is just kidnappin' your mama
Catch me in the game for 8 years
So watch my nigga catch stripes
In the middle of the night
Seein' fiends smoke pipes
Dub sacks an Coniac
Helps me deal with these phonies
Busters sellin' for G's that I stack
From the back to ponies
I got hommies with L's on they backs
Who fell through the crack
And hidin' shank's under they mattress
Where were you
When will you realize
When cockin' glocks 
To pop those cops
Makes a Mil of these blocks
Ride in drop tops
Be foolin' with G-nocks
don't trust those bitches
They choose to squish and let em squeal
Go ahead and trust em
You'll have no money screamin' Biatch!
To tha billi ba-bang
The reflections drummin' like solo
Hold on like En Vogue
Put out that Endo
Let down the window
Tec's to our set
Seventeen to mix with the bullshit
Lettin' em know at the do' with the full clip
When you bust at me 
That nigga slip
They steady runnin'
The gun
To keep the nigga off that lay low
Got niggs on the pay roll
That'll kill when I say so
Three hay-lo's

On Warnell talk to no one
Sometimes it gets to the point I 
Cock my ho's see what I'm sayin'

The lord is smokin'
that's why my life
Has been this livin' hell
For the thug life up on the street
And to the prison cell
Unlawful use is what 
They caught me with a Tec-9
An do they got probable cause
They never did take no time
Steady use of prison
Took another brothers man hood
They choose next time
Up under the bench 
They say its all good
But I was young
didn't know any better
Although I did comp out the boot-camp
Fly to give a brotha seven
Years of prison teirs
My hommies pourin' beers
I guess this henny
Should be life of what a thug lives
My only hurt
Maybe won't be my last
But here's a tip for these cops
Next time I'm goin' out with a blast
So if you look up in this black man's
Eyes of straight madness
Ready to buck you down 
Upon the ground
For all my past teachers
Give your souls up
If your showed up
don't hold up
We Do or Die
And you know we
Straight soldiers

So I told you where I hang out
Ya got some sellin' then

Throw your guns in the air
Uh-uh no time for runnin'
They'll miss the gunnin'
Its Do or Die

Lets leave the scene
And go and hide out
An miss the trippin'
Trippin' an clippin'

Motherfuck gonna die

About my hommie flippin'
Swole head and a broke jaw

But back to your slow lord, really want to know about your low luv
You can stop ackin' so so intimidated by the slow flow
Hurt my feelings is a no no
Let me sit beside you at the sun beach, got me trippin off the sun heat
See you think it run me, see you think its the weed talking
Conversation on the pond, took a pause for a minute you start walking

And when you lose control, I'ma smooth ya soul
But all I really want to know

Can I roll, roll, roll, there, there, there
You don't have to go that far

Won't 'cha men's come run wit me, let me show you what fun can be
Choppin up from beyond the sea

Never asked for a free meal, all I asked if I work coming up from the dirt 
Show me luv not a fake thrill
I'ma flirt wit the girls and um make sure that they worth time and personal
Travel round the world and um make they money while have fun, gotta have em

And they know when I be on, in the back of a caddy ridin' three strong
Roll the bees on, hit the switch on the six, roll the caddy wit d's on
To the head and the weed gone
See the mansion doors, dipping through house wit the doors
Wait to you get to the marble floors, like a Persian rug
Cow gun in the tub
Ain't got the mind for luv making, cause I'll leave you where I found you at 
The club shakin'
Cause I'll do you like bruson bacon
Baby maybe I'm mistaken,
It ain't no simp in me, its all pimp in me
And I can tell ya flip a g stack
And if its you let it bring three back

So everything I thought my whole heart I gave
From G-packs to weed packs 
It's going to give me problems I really don't need that
See I got a boy on my back
That I been running since them ways back
Tell Uncle Sam that I'm gon stay black
And fuck those silly cars stirring my shit up under this six flat
And tell them hoes who be diamond kissers
Trying to take control of a niggas riches
They can get they nose out a niggas business for it
Down here treying to set the wife off the fix and I don't play that
Praying for my downfall I'm making

Ain't trippin' got to split up the front
Approach you with a limp while I hit on the blunt
Your pager goin' off (oh, that ain't nothin')
Meet me at the crib bout 2, stop frontin'
Blow to the bone as I clicked on somethin'
Tryin' to cut me up, yeah the trick's on somethin'
The corner of the party where the niggas stay bumpin'
This is for the gin and the hen in my stomach
I'm lookin' at the do' females still comin'
Lookin' to my left and the B's still comin'
Lookin' to my right and the drinks still comin'
Tryin' to shake the dice but the girl lookin' cunnin'
Circlin' the do' where the money start runnin'
Took a pause, hey y'all whats up
Head hunters in the double-R, is it a double car
Pulled over to the car
So I, asked Proceeds, to pass the B's, no bitch

Wanna be like P-I, M-P, hoes, plenty
Comin straight from the Windy
Choppin' up tens and twenties, mm!
Lean back in the corner with the dob hat
Now my nature is to ball like a democrat
In the club with hoes, and I suppose
That I've been chose, the nigga with the hoodrat
Mm, mm, mm, mm, got it down pat
You call her what you want or even all that
I been taught by the best, so put it to rest
And I confess, I'm here just to ball black
Gettin' paid in the game bend a row free
Flip a penny to a dime I'm like an O-G
Go to the mall, with all of y'all
Show you some cash, now, tell me what you want B
You can ride or just smoke in the Cadillac
AC, windows down, with the top back
From a Caddy to Lex' to Rolex
I'm a put in a roll, tell me could you top that?
Ever though I'm makin' money in a row friend
Nickle dime if no fiend don't approach me

But now I'm stackin' C-notes, still dope
Different strokes, same folks, hangin' from a rope
Me and Do or Die just try to cope
Sit back and like a picture take a toke
Take a stroll through the hood
It's some haters but it's still all good
Roll up another bad boy, playa pimpin' to the groove
In the place to be to see who I can choose
Now it's time for me to make a move
Shorty what's the deal?

I done seen your sexy walk on the Pharcyde
So don't be ""Passin' Me By""
I'm a nigga with peas and I ain't stingy with the trees
We could be some freaks and both of our ass could be high
Fiends drip, ours is full of octane
With pimp status and a hot name, we don't gotta pop thangs
No more servin' the rock 'caine, the night-game
Flippin' flows like hoes which is a drop-game
It's like, aw suki suki now, lookie here
Stick a phrase while I trades on my hog road
Divine words form the pimp scroll
Get the bitch if I'm walkin' and she peepin' that my limp's cold
See a playa po' trippin',
Peepin' the Mediterranean try to play me in slow-vision
Picture how I'm mackin' cold women
Bendin' and grinnin my hair spinnin'
While we smokin' on Henny, still po pimpin'

Who the fuck am I? 

A born killer with no conscience 

Leaving niggas with holes in their heads unconscience 

No second chances 

'cause in this game no one advances 

You made your move and fucked up now the devil dances 

No scrilla for this just murderers with blocks 

To run up on their dick and hit em and get em hot 

With a 357 slug pointed at your nose 

Left a bloody mess and a note stuck between your toes 

You fuck with me nigga you're fucking with the warrior 

Anybody destroying you're packing the sig sauer 

Putting niggas off in body bags 'cause in this game you take no prisoners 

Leave it in blood Hare Krishna 

Nobody's breathing niggas stuck on getting even 

You die this evening insanity gon be my reason

Who ever epitomise 

And idolise my murderous skills 

With this vivid imagination and slugs that kill 

Off in the zone unorthodox with the world on blocks 

It's unexplainable how I got these bitch niggas locked 

Keep my eyes on my safe and keep this murderous flavour 

Since I picked up a strap I've had this murderous behaviour 

Spread the whole clip around and get the fuck outta Dodge 

I got a ride full of straps in my homies backyard 

It's too cold to proceed without a block to start 

Watch a gat blows him apart as the bullets depart 

Now who the fuck am I? Is the question you ask 

Can't be touched or fucked with is all you need to know 

It's 1998 plus you bitches got to go 

And y'all cain't fuck with me and tell em why 

My adrenaline rush on jump 

Plus you got my arm beneath grabbing with the double barrel pump

I never seen a thousand soldiers hit the dirt on your roll 

Fuck your chief and all the soldiers I'm a king on my own 

I'm coming with force down with Big Chief nigga Rapalot style 

Grip sixteens and triple beams will leave that ass on the pile 

Walk on down and see the light 'cause I'm not faking the shit 

I told you once that I'm a soldier I'm just taking your shit 

Now who am I a born killer nigga fuck what you heard

Now what the purpose when they still gon get struck 

And leave they brains fucked up 

I don't know why they put they eyes on me 

'cause I'm a black material killer trying to keep it low key 

Now what it was they probably didn't know it was me 

But that goes to show em that fancy bitches focus just be 

They want to look up on my Rolex while I spot on my heat 

They see my Lexus car shining when I been on the streets 

With no ticket on it but still they try to find out what's in it 

It's a black nigga with a black chrome on the seat 

In the dark zone it's on

Hey man, niggas tryin' to stir up shit between amongst us
And Chicago man, what you think about this shit?
Ah, between us and the snipers?
Man I'm talking about us and every motherfucking body, man
Ah but you know we too tight up in Chicago
We got love worldwide baby don't stop, north, south, east and west
That's right, know what I'm saying, straight up coming to you
Snipers and do or die, rap-a-lot mafia
From the chi, here it go like this

I went from zip locks and baking soda
To smoking herb, cooking 'ola
Never looking overnight success
Cause I want a rover
Hold you head up and stick yo chest out
And if you heavy off in this game then get yo vest out
I hit the scene like po-po's
In the four door chevrolet, we gas
With hats broke off to the left
To show you exactly where you at
I want the scratch that you done say
Remember, bust a cap a lot
For the rooftop snipers snap a lot
Putting down with rap-a-lot
You'll die, can't fuck with us
So when you say it, you'll a lie
You'll try and get shut down
From Texas all the way back to chi

Ain't no success even if you crying for it
Them niggas alive know it, they dying for it
Even them niggas that kill, get caught, and strive for it
I strive for it
That's why I sixteen years and a positive
Try to let go of my negative
Only got one life to live
It's fucked up, only had one chance
And now I'm taking it
See niggas faking it
If a nigga ain't real then his ass ain't making it

Overnight, I had to do more than hold the mike
Had to control the fight
Had to make sure my dough was right
Had to make sure my boys was tight
Noise and lights, stalking from the end of my ? gonna spook ya
Horror type of tactics, you bet the snipers ? knew ya
Stressed out, had me feeling left out
Stuck and I gotta get my self out
But when I was kid then crept out
Fuck all the ones who never helped out
Stepped out with grams and plans to be an overnight achiever
Since ? to non-believers, overnight

[Chorus: x2]
You can do what you wanna do
But it ain't gonna happen for you
Not overnight
Overnight, overnight, overnight
Overnight, overnight, overnight

Living it up, this ain't no overnight shit
See ? got a death wish
But do or die and snipers , represent chi-town
Took a life and get lit up quick
Rain niggas got me doing this
Used to be on some sell ass shit
Or mail that bitch back home in a box
And leave no trail of this
Now won't witness this and this is
How's it's gonna fall
All of y'all gonna battle
Leave this life, all shells goin' drop tonight
You say that you want a spot
Better they hit like the shit from rap-a-lot
So pack that glock or AK stops your clock, my straps get hot
Even though it's hot it ain't hot enough to stop this entourage
Rain, do or die, pick a piece snypaz, one big mob
Better stop that heart

So flex that shit cause down in Texas, everybody talks
Cause ain't gonna fall, overnight

Bet the po' to the next thug
Recognize the queen, you come to me
But you gotta see, you're a what-what?
Gotta sign then flip bitch
Hit the block, I'ma rhyme in the Hummer
Better be on some platinum shit
Roley bling bling, keep a gat want to snap it
Been well known to react quick
When they see I got a star, they pause and they react quick
I'm immune to the hot shit, nevertheless
Shitty just beware of where the hat fit
Yo pimp where the plastic?
This pimp, real pimp, it's the pimp like a maverick
Playerism is a habit
I'm at the club wit 'um wit Crystal, what what

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Lil' baller be me, can't see me
Never get her with a TV, cause we be
In the five-double-oh, posed with the clothes
Dyslexic on the passenger side
Don't mean that I ain't got the keys to ride
She's the pie, my, my, my
We done came to fuck and get gone, pay no bills
Flex the mind to make the bank to bounce
Nigga bounce shit like the Dirty South
Watch that shit with a dirty mouth
Know you ain't mad, ain't splurging out
But if ya heard me out, on the passenger side
Care to bore me with the rest of the guys?
Spitting blunts, dropping jewels
Spitting at hoes, that'll be cool

[Johnny P]
Pay no bills, pay no bills
Pay no bills, pay no..,
I gotta keep it real, so I can't pay this here
Why you all up in my grill?
You can tell me about it, to pay the bill, pay the bill

Gotta make the paper 
Can't let the paper make me
La di da di da di da

Thug come up in a fresh white Benz
Baby mama talkin' crazy cause I'm high again
Flow like a motherfucker say it again
Twenties lookin' like ooh
With the guy like who
Back up the bad money,put it in cruise
Got's new jeans, suits and Timbaland boots
Get off em', '92, all why'all ball
You playin with me, yo, I'm ballin' for all

[Chorus:]

In 96', ok, we made the m-o-n-e-why again
M-o-n-e-why, do you see what you like?
Flashin' cars, worries gone,??
Never went to my head, 'cause I stacked em', yo
Maxed a ho
You could roll by,I lock the door
La di da di da di da, I got a lot for sure
Ho, I make the paper, I don't let it make me
I stay runnin' through my hood, I don't let it break me
I work to get my cheddar, I ain't get it for free
You can do the same, I do so,so why you hatin' on me?
It be, 99' we ridin' in Benz, expo
For the one solo, we ballin' in twins
Right up again, we love em, I said it before
Stack your paper when you make it, it be money galore
Let em know, for those who be round my door
If it ain't about the dollar, then it really ain't low

[Chorus:]

In my early life,they told me I was chasin' a dream
Because I wanted everything that I seen on the screen 
Big home, diamonds, furs,and even them drop tops
I went from ??, little red model and I-Roc
I used to, drive my friends, to rollerskating, use my vocal chords
Choosin' ya know, now I'm on the production board
Took the Benz down until my feet touched the ground
And when the heat touched the ground, they had to sit me down
But the problem changed now
At first I started hustling, fuck struggling
I rather throw bricks, steady smuggling
I was down for an ounce, seven years no parole
It's bad and it's cold,mature getting old
And if you didn't know,now you know
Easy gettin' slow, now I'm gettin' paid for my show

Yo, I know niggas that kill
Niggas that dump pills

Niggas that don't feel
No remorse like mil for a bitch like you
I'm a Outlaw
What the fuck you thought I would do?
Elaine told me
Never let a fiend hold me
These streets is like hockey
And Kadafi the goalie
Know me
I'm too holy
You too phony
And too bony Tiger
Step in with two Tony's
With two chrome heats
Aimed at your dome-piece
It's all til we deceased
As long as we agree
It ain't a war
If there ain't no blood
Motherfucker
You ain't an Outlaw
If you ain't no thug
Middle fingers up
Wave 'em from side to side

Wave 'em from side to side

Outlaws call on me
You see the balls on me
I'm gonna let 'em swang
Without them thangs
So if them cops rush them lanes
Put their names up the wall
Exactly where you left the green stacks
Money from the refs
Like you stackin' from that caine
If it's bullshit we'll set it off
If it's a full clip I'm gonna let it off
From L.A. to Chi-town
From Jersey to the black grounds
We'll shut this whole bitch down

Who wanna bomb first?
Then the rest gonna follow
We livin' for today
We might not make it to tomarrow
Bore in your heart

We share the same pain
This ain't a fair game
From your hood to my hood

While we sip on Hennessey hit the speed in the cut would you come come come
would you come come come would you come come come

[Verse 1]
3 double O AM she step into my x-5 beamer
You should have seen her
With a rubber perfection you can put it in a session with Janet Jackson
Little league the chemistry was up to satisfaction
With a magnificent ark spark bringing flame like a arsons
I locked the door and drove off and I drove off kind of slowly
Cause the popo's always blow me
And this is what she told me, she put her lips to my ear move closely
When we got into traffic she indicated what she working with and put her
lips around my LORD HAVE MERCY
I drove and watch, I watched them grow, I spit my hen, I smoke my dro.. shit
In between conversations she was like....she was like...oohhh oohh ooh oh oh ooohhhh
You already know, she was already blown, she was already gone
She was already sprung gone with her tongue uh huh uh huh

Baby want to come at 3 AM
She giving me the keys to the new be	-M
Plus she giving me and you won't see him
And she giving me to the you see them
Pick up the phone then arrive at the door
She came out and the white touched the floor
Gotta lay back cause the rain goin pour
Hope for the shade make it one night more
Looking like a diva with the queens on tour
I belong she's allmo
In the bedroom now its time for sex
Anything goes you can walk like mex
After making love and I will not jet
Up and down and around we go
I can feel her nails when she scream below
I'm a real pimp see I still gotta go
Some get pussy and they still don't know

No no no no no (see)
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah (be gone)

Or purchase a home for my belo luxury home with a platinum visa
Its hard to imagine something like a nigga tryin to catch an orgasm
Track that feeling like a spasm
Tryin to study passin, got a passion gotta count that cheese
They off in the breeze but it ain't nothing
If you got that paper then say something
Better put it away Cause the day comin when you fall off,
When you just want to hall off with four sawed offs blow it all off
Recognise its the big faces that count, better yet better stay flexed
Check the paper stay stressed and get all the dough whether its fast or slow
Get up to the point where the cash will flow
Burger King and Mcdonalds really ain't the way the best will go
And its so cold in these windy streets
When the ends meet your life will be ends deep with white shit

Do or Die,"Whoa
And ya got that sex appeal

She had a walk too sassy
Approachin' with a dog that looked like Lassie
The lipstick, and the Fendi, Prada
Kinda lookin' all classy
Psychological tendency, proto-call
Just lookin' at the article
Weed smell on my Prada clothes
Sometimes, I trip on myself
How I spit at these modern ho's
On the two-way, poppin' and droppin' the conversation
And I'm steady staggerin'
Look at the Remy that I had last week off Madison
Tryna walk a straight line
But I can't find a pattern in her
I looked at the door
Put my drink on the floor
Cocked my nine when I opened it slow
Half-breed Chinese, sittin' a Lac
And about a hash green, plus
The audacity of the star
Strippin' and maneuver her ass like next to me
Actually, this S-E-X is testin' me
A-double-P, E-A-L
And it sound like her body is callin' me
But it might be the alcohol in me
And the sex appeal, it keep on drawin' me

Sex, sex, appeal
I'm talkin' bout sex appeal
Sex, sex, appeal
Her body keep callin' me, whoa
Sex, sex, appeal
I'm talkin' 'bout sex appeal, girl, whoa right
Sex, sex, appeal, whoa-ah

I'm finna get her off, high Hydro
Bump a crown from mista porch
Hey there lil' mama
Do you wanna come kick your heels
In the back of my Range Rove?
Wanna do what'chu did before?
Don't trip, cause ""You Already Know""
C-O-M-E-B-E-W-I-X-T, that me, Belo
Just do it ""Nice And Slow""
You gotta raise the door
And I don't pay for show
'Cause I don't pay fo-sho
You can grab yo' kicks and go
Put on yo (shh), let's roll
Recognize the G, true ballin'
Do or die, pimp or die, not fallin'
When we all in, yo club
Chillin' with the chiefs and the dubs
And I got love for the jiggaboos
Pop Chrys' with the niggas, and the bitches too
Dig a bitch out the Grove, like I just do
People say I'm like a statue
Spit the B in yo ear
Take you off to the real, and I match you
Sex appeal

Sex, sex, appeal
I'm talkin' bout sex appeal
Sex, sex, appeal
Her body keep callin' me, whoa
Sex, sex, appeal
I'm talkin' 'bout sex appeal, girl, whoa right
Whoa-ah, na, na, na

Go kick it wit' my niggas in the drop Regal
Do what, a Twista, Caddy, Po-Pimp sequel
On my way to the club, peek-a-boo motherfucka
But first I gotta roll one, for my people
Hate us for doin' that, saw us
Through Windy City, nightcrawlers
Who would have imagined lyricals on the legacy?
Cities legendary like, Rap-A-Lot and Legit Ballaz
Shit, let the Mo' pop, and drop the top
Ride like it's summertime in the Chi
Get'chu blind, to the abra
Blowin' lime to the sky
Rhyme til' I die, tryin' to get by
Lil' miss, lookin' tight in the coochie
Whether it's a Gucci
Love the way you do the jiggy when you walk
Soundin' like you freaky, girl, every time you talk
I know ya aura make the fellas wanna break 'em off
Hear me brotha?
Gotta try to get our feet further
Hit a lic' and feed, one-another
'Cause all we got is, each-other
I take it week after week
And to kick the flows that I freak but, uh
Roll up on a chick and spit game
Let me show you how the back seat of a Lexus feel
Take a hit of cess and chill
Girl, dressed to kill
Whippin' that sex appeal
Next appeal?

Sex, sex, appeal (whoa)
I'm talkin' bout sex appeal, hey
Sex, sex, appeal

Do or Die,"I sit alone in the basement
Facing, chasing these wicked, demons
Got thoughts up in ma head of my daddy's wasted s-semen
Havin' her in the bedroom,
9-1-1 'cause I'm not breathin'
Feelin like death is getting closer and I can't stop from secedein'
Do I run to the mirror
Look at me, and pull the trigger.
Hooker said body found dead and gone
Well shit, just another dead nigga.
My future, lookin weary, hear me
Maybe after that wanna flex, wanna hustle
Never lay down a bit and tussle
Take my life, in one night
Now I'm havin' visions
Do or die based on decisions
Movin crystal sista, mssions
But I wanna be and fly away like pigeons
I missin my family an all
But I just don't know dog
'cause I left another dog in the back yard
An he jab wit the left an he hit hard
(but I break off)

(Chorus)
And that's why I stay low
'cause the world's gettin' too cold
We yellin it off the ""O""
'cause the world's full of bitches
(picture this)
Cold cold world.
They ask why I stay low
'cause the world's gettin too cold
We yellin out the ""O""
'cause the world's full of bitches
It just is
Cold cold world

Picture two worlds collide
Every civilization died
Catchin bullet holes
You can still hear they mamas crying
In every second is the grave laid tight
Niggas getting murdered and losin paper and they life
These days ain't so bright now
This is a message to how shorties gotta pipe down
I know we wansta weather crime on the streets
We hear the sound of the heat
And every round is takin ya six feet
I heard the cops killed you last week
You got shot tryin to take the phone off the seat
Rest in peace, I know it's better when your eyes sleep
God take us by the hands as we right deep
No longer seek for the things that weaken the flesh
Did we believe and have faith when it bothered us?
I understand that we all must return to dust
And leave behind everything that our hands have touched
God, this world is too much.

(chorus)

I first took a breather
Heard a voice to the 1-9
Nigga tryin tear ma life line
Get it back and to ma right man
Seeing blood on the sleece and a black nine
Please god is it my time?
Hold on to what am I face up for
Black the night was
No light was
Willing with the wind blew in
Below, with a slug to the moon
Open in time with the tomb
Looking for the hospital room
Feelin kinda dizzy from the blood shed
Turn around and heard a thug said
I gotta place we can play at
Hop to da 99' never get at all red
Come out quick before we all dead
To the back row
Sippin henesey
Better get relocated to the ash row
Here that nine with the bullet-proof vest go
Hottie lets go
Pull a chromium free with the vest go
Just a little on the testicle
Never leaving till the rest go
And it's best to know
Every dog on a day got a chance to bring
Got a chain for the best clothes
I wanna die my best slow
And even in my death glow
Lets have a prayer for the world, the cold one
From the old to the small one
Just to say that we are one
Father listen
This world is cold.

Well, when I heard a knock at the door
Must of been the girl that I met on the lo
She real thick, nice shape 5-4
Had a few here so we head to the show
Afterward we hit the Mo Mo Mo
Yes stay click, in the Expo
I'm city sharp, buy the mink to the floor
Damn natural, never walk from the store
Gimmie a minute, and get down with a pro
P. I. M. P. P. O. get a few friend like a party fa sho
We can hit a tune like my homie Debo
All in the mall buying Avirex, we can sport mine called S.E.X
Platinum link, all in effect
I can pick head but I'm a bad for a check
In the truck though, so I can hop in the Lex
Baby got back, but I'm trying to relax
P.L.A.Y.E.R., giving her eyes
Then we head to the bar
Never give her money, 'cause she know she a star
Did you want to ride in my car?

Do you? (Do you? Do you? Do you?)

23's like Jordan on the Escalade
Got a pound of dro' girl, if you want to blaze
You can let your hair down, while the AC blow
Before you get in, I just need to know

Do you? (Do you? Do you? Do you?)
I'll keep it on the low
Do you? Do you?

In the mood, like yes why'all
Rather be, let it test why'all
Light the be	 if it's special
Can I undress to relax why'all
Well, stretch out like a Lex ball
If it's that raw, to the chests with the Remy
Like a slug with your vest off
Let me touch it, if it's that soft
And relieving in the menopause
I can't believe how they sent them off
Took the number then I'm in the mall
Being grinning bout to spend them all
Just balling, shot shot calling
Holla at my dogg while they sipping alcohol
Really want to kick it, but they all just stalling
6 dime pieces, checking out my pausing
They looking like ooh, he flossing
Baby girl, I don't do this often
In the five double 0 for sho'
We still ride the Cadillac, slam the doors
Suppose I kick back, keep the flows
Dressed to impress, then flex the ho
Check the dough

Do you? (Do you? Do you Do you?)
I'll keep it on the lo
Do you? Do you?
Do you?

An it really don't matter, where we go
Let's sip this Henny, pop this Mo
Before I strip you, I just need to know
Can I do you?

Now I was kicking, when I met you in the club
Had me feeling on your booty, and the brother was a fiftyball
For you, I even popped some Crissy in the tub
And my body was start wondering when if I'm a get the draws
Let me know if I'm in the right lane
Tell me when I say the right things
I got tight flame
Rollin through stunting why are you running
Cause I'm coming with some pimp-type game
Iced out charm, chromed out truck
Coming through balling like I don't really give a fuck
Blowing the fatty, an purple, with the windows up
When I'm sipping on Hennessey and Hypnotic getting stuck
And I need a thug
To care for me while haters be attacking me, backing me
To a corner while a brother trying to get theirs
And I need a queen backing me while I'm running my faculty
Telling me I be lethal when I spit words
Hit herb??????
Hold it in, then blow it out
Do you like the way I flow it out
Don't ever act funny or petty with the money
When I throw it out
Do you like how I talk
Do you like the way I ride
Do you like the way I pimp spree's
You can let me down easy
Cause' still ill be the player Twista slash be a P.I.M.P
Now baby, do you?

I'm just a ghetto boy

They tell me it's like
The money, power, money and power
How can this world rotate without this money and power?
If I had money, I'd keep my peoples outta poverty
'Cause ain't no more starvin' when y'all around me (Shiiit)
This what it gotta be B, and every playa got paper
Shinin' like a superstar, with matchin' minks and gators
Keepin' our family off this poor table
Cause ain't no food on it
And every crab up in this bucket gotta move on it
I'm just a ghetto boy

Livin' in this ghetto world
Stayin' with' this ghetto chick
Hopin' to have a ghetto girl
And after all, ain't no spaces for that
How can we live up in this world, when ain't no place for the blacks?
Cause every dollar got a dream behind it, we seem to be blinded
Malcom X, he had to dream to remind us
Believe me, havin' money can have this world fucked up
But it can't answer yo' prayers, when you get down on yo' luck

Mama workin' hours
Tryina feed a, family
Daddy's in and out
Takin' baths with' broken showers
Next-door neighbor gave us the vapors
Callin' cops, cause we known to plot
Break in they home, on some bogus capers
But I never thought that it would affect me later
Until I seen the hustle, when niggas ridin' stretch Navigators
But, more now then later, I should come up
Cause I seen my homie on the block, slangin' rocks
And then his spot get gunned up
I never visioned it'd be homicide
Because they told me he'll live
That's what they said when my homie Boosie died
Could all these millions bring my nigga back?
Could all these millions feed children?
Could all these millions make my spirit fat?
Would all my friends become my enemies?
When my family becomes astonished
Will my strengths becomes an enemy?
Is this ""pretend to be? 
A vivid and magically?
A vivid and magically
I wonder, I wonder

I wonder, whoooooaa-ooohhh-oaahhhhh

I wonder what my life would be if I
Had that paaaper (Had that paper)
I'm just a ghetto boy (Ohhh, ohhh)

Now if I live on top of the world (The world)

I'm not poor anymore
But somedays
I said I wish that I was poor again

Back in the days, when I was poor

But somedays
I said I wish that I was poor again (Ohhh)

When it was cold outside
Sellin' packs and holdin' heat
Run up and I fold in the street
Penitentiary moldin' me
And the city get as cold as, thugs
I wonder will I come up? Get gunned up?
Turned up? Or anotha' sta-tistic
And my mama just goin', ball-istic
Realistic-ally, don't wanna do the caper
But I gotta get the paper, niggas ballin'
'Cause the county judge is callin'
And the lawyer keep stallin'
Why my niggas keep fallin', victim
To the same old theory?
Another bad outcome, leavin' mothers just out-done
Then it suddenly just sinked in
That my nigga just died last weekend, tears rollin'
And I'm goin' off the deep end
But I gotta stay stong, for the mothers and the kids
Just standin' there lookin' at the chalk line
In his hand was a cocked nine
Now should I walk a straight line?
'Cause ""Time After Time""
I just wanna rewind, and talk to you
At the grave site, gave it to 'em every day and night
But it's alright, and I really wanna talk to you
I really wanna talk to you (Just really wanna talk to you)

Most of the times I can't let these niggas get near me
With this hatred, jealousy, and envy
I went to church and they said you had a remedy
A remedy to set me free and take away my enemies
So I pray to the day when I get to see
All the faces that put me down up in the industry
So from the street to the club

I done got a hold of them my fellas on the train
While she lie back, now motherfucker can you bow down?
Where your ride at? On the passenger side of your hoes
Trying to come up on another G
The broad all up under me trying to smother me
Looking lovely while I roll another bead, suddenly
She learned that I don't deal with emotions
But when we in the room she rubbing me with lotion
Coming like an ocean coasting have a cigarette thinking
Me and Do or Die dig drinking love potion
The word that was never said
Twisted be giving women dick in the bed
Until they sick in the head, and if I ever leave whoever dead
They ain't tricking the Feds or spitting game
But it's chicken and bread
Kicking them legs in the air like a player do
Then be little in a day or two
After words I'm slay a crew, now that's some pimp type shit
That be	Low and AK'll do, wearing gray and blue
If a hoe want to holler then you a player if you hit them ends
and get the dividends but you a pimp if you can get
The same hoe to want to freak your friends

What you know about the Mobster Elites, Crucial Conflict and them Do or Die flows
What you know about Kellz & Twist, two multi-platinum artists steppin'out the suicide doors
I ain't claimin' the crown or the throne, but I know I'm Chi-town to the bone
Come and have a round of Patron and get down to the song while 
I tell you bout the ground I be on Chicago
Tell a girl about K-town and the projects, downtown and all these places
Caught her starin' at the ice in my ear, she almost fainted when she saw these glaciers
Feel the words when I spit em in the mic, First I gotta get up with the mob in the light
Rollin' 40 deep to the club and I'm like, gotta see what I'm bout to fuck tonight
The party so live, and I'm bout to set it off for the 0-5
It's all good but I got the 4-5, and I found me a down ass hoe to ride
And she got a fat ol' ass that'll brighten up the room
Come let a West Side Nigga slide this dick off in yo womb, Uh huh
Put the dial on her booty make her lively, most likely, she think I'ma make her wifey
Got her hooked like nightly, she wanna bite me, when I come up in the room in a White-Tee
Presidential Suite, wit some drank and some kush about to get em on
After dis one night, I'ma be the one you call, when you wanna get a hit until the early mon
Pimp on

[Chorus]

[R. Kelly]
Hoppin' out the fattest cars that money can buy (can buy)
Chick on my side (on my side)
Step off up in the club, 708 reppin' the Chi (Chi)
I'm at the bar talkin to this chic sippin on that magic potion
Tryna get her to let me dive off in that ass like it's an ocean
(rub her down) with some heated lotion
(and now)got honey soakin'
(she's ready) for the pipe
(fuckin' with) her emotions
Wanna show you what a true player's like, you would swear you was in paradise
Wanna turn that ass over and ride, good-bye to them other guys
Girl if you ride out wit me I promise you won't regret it
I shoot hoop and so you know this boy is real athletic
You want me to go down on you baby don't even sweat it
Just pass the Remy to me and watch me get real nasty
R's gonna give it to you how you like it, I'll be bumpin' on dat

[Chorus]

[Nard]
Yo Kellz, take another sip, den another trip buy another fifth (now another bad bitch want me)
Grab another clip, hit it like the trip, represent the pimps (still a lot of platinum on me)
Sit back relax and watch her ride on me, get up in the morning do the same to her homie
Chuuch right here, motherfucker can't clone me
Louis Vitton, Gucci and Prada, hit it from the back and make her girlfriend holla
Pimperish but he walk like a schola, Stack the paper like the almighty dolla
I'ma make it do, what it do you dig?

[Belo]
Well it gotta be (hoes) gotta be (dog) gotta be (dro) gotta be (well) gotta be (club) gotta be (shy) gotta be (long) gotta be (dance)
I was out West at the circle when I met this woman
She was dark-skinned had a shape like a mountain so I know she ain't frying
Put that ass in the back of the jeep and I know she's coming
Says Belo when her toes curl up when I know she's cumming
They supposed to be coming
I can give you what you want like some dick for days
Belo be a nympho girl, and I can kiss you where you wanna sex you 3-4 ways
Like ya lips, cheeks, arms, back, middle place
But I gotta stay true cuz I'm a realist so I gets paid

Looked and said, ""That's nothin' but game Cam""

Love of comrades fighting for the people and love of people
Not an abstract people but people one meets and works with

At the center of revolutionary endeavor, he meant both

Go from trips to Delancey to trips to the Grammy's cause
Most of these girls be confusin me
I don't know if they really love me or they usin me
Here's the money, or maybe you ain't used to me
Cause you was depressed and now you abusin me

I had a girl that would've died for me
Didnt 'preciate her so I made her cry for me
Every night she had tears in her eyes for me
Caught a case, shorty took the whole ride for me
At first we were friends then became lovers
You was more than my girl, we was like brothers
All night we would play fight under covers
Now you gone, can't love you like I really wanna
But everytime I think about your pretty smile
And how we used to drive the whole city wild
Damn I wish you would've had my child
A pretty little girl wit Diddy's style; this shit is wild
All them days that I reminisce
About the way that I used to kiss the pretty lips

How John Lewis did murder poor little Omie Wise.
He told her to meet him at Adams's Springs.
He promised her money and other fine things.

So, fool-like she met him at Adams's Springs.
No money he brought her nor other fine things.

""Go with me, little Omie, and away we will go.
We'll go and get married and no one will know.""

She climbed up behind him and away they did go,
But off to the river where deep waters flow.

""John Lewis, John Lewis, will you tell me your mind?
Do you intend to marry me or leave me behind?""

""Little Omie, little Omie, I'll tell you my mind.
My mind is to drown you and leave you behind.""

""Have mercy on my baby and spare me my life,
I'll go home as a beggar and never be your wife.""

He kissed her and hugged her and turned her around,
Then pushed her in deep waters where he knew that she would drown.

He got on his pony and away he did ride,
As the screams of little Omie went down by his side.

T'was on a Thursday morning, the rain was pouring down,
When the people searched for Omie but she could not be found.

Two boys went a-fishin' one fine summer day,
And saw little Omie's body go floating away.

They threw their net around her and drew her to the bank.
Her clothes all wet and muddy, they laid her on a plank.

Then sent for John Lewis to come to that place --
And brought her out before him so that he might see her face.

He made no confession but they carried him to jail,
No friends or relations would go on his bail.

Fear in the journey
Joy in the coming home
A part of the heart
Gets lost in the learning
Somewhere along the road

Along the road
Your path may wander
A pilgrim's faith may fail
Absence makes the heart grow stronger
Darkness obscures the trail

Courting disaster
Measureless nights forebode
Moments of rest
Glimpses of laughter
Are treasured along the road

Along the road

Your thoughts may start to stray
But through it all a heart held humble
Levels and lights your way

Doc & Merle Watson,"With a dark and rolling sea,
Between my love and me,
I keep walking through this cold hard town.
While I wait for better days,
I could use a place to stay,
Or a floor where I could lay my blanket down.

[Chorus]
If I could beg, steal, or borrow,
A ticket on some boat or plane,
I'd be leaving London tomorrow,
To fly to my young love again.

Up at dawn to change my shirt,
And to wash away the dirt,
Then it's over to American Express.
Not one letter did I find.
No, she didn't send one line,
Though I know she had my forwarding address.

[Chorus]

Last night the Troubadour,
Was so full they barred the door,
And I sang a song she knows quite well.

Doc & Merle Watson,"I'm a guy with a heart of gold
The ways of a gentleman I've been told
The kind of guy who'd never harm a flea

Me and a certain character met
Man who invented the cigarette
I'd murder that son of a gun in first degree

It ain't 'cause I don't smoke myself
And I don't figure it'll ruin my health
I've been smoking 'em all my life, ain't dead yet

But nicotine slaves are all the same
And pettin', party or a poker game
Every thing's gotta stop while I smoke that cigarette

Smoke, smoke, smoke that cigarette
Puff, puff, puff and if you puff yourself to death
Tell Saint Peter at the golden gate
Lord, you hate to make him wait
You gotta have another cigarette

Game of chance, the other night
Old dame fortune was doing me right
The Kings and Queens kept on coming round

Now I drew a full, abetted high
My bluff didn't work on a certain guy
Kept on betting, layin' his money down

He'd raise me and I'd raise him
Sweated blood, you gotta sink or swim
Finally called, then didn't raise the bet

I said, ""Aces full, pal, how 'bout you?""
He said, ""I'll tell you in a minute or two
Right now I'm gonna light up another cigarette""

Smoke, smoke, smoke that cigarette
Puff, puff, puff and if you puff yourself to death
Tell Saint Peter at the golden gate

Oh, Lord, you hate to make him wait
You gotta have another cigarette

The other night, I had a date
With the cutest girl in the forty-eight states
Regular fancy kinda dame

Said she loved me, seemed to me
Things going the way it is supposed to be
Hand in hand, we was strolling down Lover's Lane

She's, oh, so far from a keg of ice
Our pettin' party was going nice
So help me, Hannah, I haven't been there yet

But I gave her a hug, gave her a squeeze
She said, ""Cody, excuse me please
But could I palm one of your cigarettes?""

Smoke, smoke, smoke that cigarette
Puff, puff, puff and if you puff yourself to death
Tell Saint Peter at the golden gate
Now Lord, hate to make him wait
But you gotta have one more cigarette

No two hands quite the same
But I never saw a winner that didn't bet

So if any people tryin' to quit
I ain't gonna criticize you one bit
I'm gonna change my kind of cigarette

By the fire in that neat little cabin

Santa Claus is comin' to town
He's making a list and checking it twice
Gonna find out who's naughty and nice
Santa Claus is comin' to town
He sees you when you're sleepin'
He knows when you're a wake
He knows if you've been bad or good
So be good for goodness sake
Oh! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
 
With little tin horns and little toy drums
Rooty toot toots and rummy tum tums
Santa Claus is comin' to town
And curly head dolls that toddle and coo
Elephants, boats, and kiddie cars too
Santa Claus is comin' to town
Then kids in Girl and Boy land will have a jubilee
They're gonna build a Toyland all around the Christmas tree
So! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
 
Now Santa is a busy man, He has no time to play
He's got millions of stockings to fill on Christmas day
You'd better write your letter now
And mail it right away
Because he's getting ready
His reindeer's and his sleigh. So

Somewhere along the Rio Grande
Sadly I'm reminiscing, madly again I'm kissing
Someone along the Rio Grande
 
It happened in Monterey, a long time ago
I met her in Monterey, in old Mexico
Stars and steel guitars
And luscious lips, as red as wine
Broke somebody's heart
And I'm afraid that it was mine
It happened in Monterey
Without thinking twice
I left her and threw away the key to paradise
My indiscreet heart, longs for the sweetheart 
That I left in old Monterey
 
Making believe I'm merry
In ev'ry glass of sherry
I see the sparkle of her eye
And when I hear the cello
Tender and sweet and mellow
I hear the music of her sigh

Doesn't belong to me
Someone who can't be faithful
Knows that I have to be
Wonder if I am wrong to give her my loyalty

Why should I be a lone soul
Why can't I be my own soul
Alone from night to night you'll find me
Too weak to break the chains that bind me
I need no shackles to remind me
I'm just a prisner of love
For one comand I stand and wait now

From one who's master of my Fate now
I can't escape for it's too late now
I'm just a prisoner of love
What's the good of my caring if someone is sharing
Those arms with me
Although she has another
I can't have another
For I'm not free
She's in my dreams awake or sleeping
Up on my knees to her I'm creeping
My very life is in her keeping
I'm just a prisoner of love.

A little room where all the roses bloom
I want to lead you into Nature's hall
Where ev'ry year the roses give a ball
They have an orchestra up in the trees
For their musicians are the birds and bees
And they will sing us a song
As we are strolling along
 
In sunny Roseland, where summer breezes are playing
Where the honey bees are ""A-Maying""
There all the roses are swaying
Dancing while the meadow brook flows
The moon when shining is more than ever designing
For 'tis ever then I am pining
Pining to be sweetly reclining
Somewhere in Roseland
Beside a beautiful rose
 
The ball is over and tulips meet
Their little kisses are so short and sweet
The lilies nod to the forget-me-nots
When they're departing in their flower pots
But all the roses with their spirits high
Remain to love until they droop and die
And dear, why shouldn't it be
Just so with you and with me

Where the honey bees are ""A-Maying""

She was stretched out on a long white table, 
So sweet, cool and so fair

Put a twenty dollar gold piece on my watch chain

A hundred years from today
 
Don't save your kisses, just pass them around
You'll find my reason is logic'lly sound
Who's going to know that you passed them around
A hundred years from today!
Why crave a penthouse that's fit for a queen
You're nearer heaven on Mother Earth's green
If you had millions what would they all mean
A hundred years from today
So laugh and sing, make love the thing
Be happy while you may
There's always one, beneath the sun
Who's bound to make you feel that way
The moon is shining, and that's a good sign
Cling to me closer and say you'll be mine

Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb

The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you

And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms

Of paradise, where roses grew

In my heart it will remain

Doc Evans,"I cover the waterfront,
I'm watching the sea,
Will the one I love,
Be coming back to me?

I cover the waterfront,
In search of my love,
And I'm covered by,
A starless sky above.

Here am I,
Patiently waiting,
Hoping and longing,
Oh! How I yearn!
Where are you?
Are you forgetting?
Do you remember?
Will you return?

For the one I love,
Must come back to me.",I Cover the Waterfront,1959
Doc Evans,"Walked with no one and talked with no one
And I had nothing but shadows
Then one morning you passed
And I brightened at last
Now I greet the day and complete the day
With the sun in my heart
All my worry blew away
When you taught me how to say

Grab your coat and get your hat
Leave your worry on the doorstep
Just direct your feet
To the sunny side of the street
Can't you hear a pitter-pat?
And that happy tune is your step
Life can be so sweet
On the sunny side of the street

I used to walk in the shade
With those blues on parade
But I'm not afraid
This Rover crossed over

If I never have a cent
I'd be rich as Rockefeller
Gold dust at my feet
On the sunny side of the street
Grab your street",On the Sunny Side of the Street,1959
Doc Evans,"I got a big surprise when I saw you smile
I never dreamed that it could be
But now I realize since I saw you smile
There's only happiness for me

Bells ring
Birds sing
Sun is shining
No more pining
Just we two
Smiling thru
Don't sigh
Don't cry

So sweet, cool and so fair

I'll pack my truck and make my give-a-way

Pulls that man around by her, if it wasn't for her and her
That man I love would have gone nowhere, nowhere

C'est le deuxième couplet, j'espère qu'on va clipper. Tu pourras voir la tristesse de mon quartier. Ici tout est gris, ça s'appelle Paris. Les rues sont mortes, les filles décolorées. Pour rester bronzées, elles brûlent sous U.V. Toujours fâchée la fille de la ville est agressive comme un flic en civil. Y a comme une odeur de gaz sur les Champs-Elysées, et les bombes pètent dans le RER D. Ma mère est fatiguée, je la laisse se respirer. Je vis de mon côté et tente de subsister. Arrête de rapper me crie-t-elle toute la journée. Ce n'est pas sérieux, trouve un métier. Fumer ça donne faim, je suis Arsène Lupin. Je tape à E.D ; même sans les mains. Sur mon canapé, on est moins serré. C'est sûr certains se sont fait soulever. Je pense aux novices et n'oublie pas mes complices.

REFRAIN

J'veux porter des shorts toute ma vie. Avec mon escorte quitter Paris. Manger du poisson grillé sur la plage du Gosier. Prendre des bains de mer avec le Ministère. Mais je me suis noyé, je ne sais pas nager, les rues sont profondes et mènent toutes au Boulevard Ney. Comment s'en sortir pour la fille du quartier ? Elle croit que pour percer, il faut se faire trouer. Certains jouent au foot et veulent devenir pro. D'autres dealent et rêvent de kilos. Les seringues mortes se ramassent à la pelle sur les trottoirs de la rue La Chapelle. On protège nos fils de tout ce vice. Dans les cours d'école, on ne sniffe plus de colle. Drogue et alcool ont pris le monopole. Ma vie n'est pas simple, elle n'est pas funky. Moi je suis né ici et mon enfant aussi.

De ceux qui boivent du douze ans d'âge
Prisonnier du quartier, pis dans la fonse-dé

Depuis que j'ai la tête collée sur un pochette
Certaines font semblant de ne pas me reconnaître
D'autres me guettent, s'entêtent, m'embêtent
Alors je les pètent
Et tout est si facile quand on marche dans sa ville
Même les bleus pour moi sont en civile

Dans une chausette la boulette à effriter

Les meufs de gang bang, et les gros bangs
Bang dans la tête de mes amis
N'y pense même pas si tu tiens à ta vie
J'ai troqué ma famille, contre ces amis
Et je me moque de ton avis
Je veux me doper à la Maradona

J'achète des tickets par simple peur
D'avoir à buter un contrôleur
Je flirt avec le meurtre, je flirt avec mon suicide
Vive le volontaire homicide
Je ne crois plus en Dieu et deviens nerveux
Allah, Krichna, Bouddah ou Jéovah
Moi j'opte pour ma paire de Puma
Elle guide mes pas à pas
J'ai fait le bon choix, et j'y crois
Je n'ai pas touché, mais caressé tous mes rêves
Je demande une trêve, le Doc est en grève
Plus rien ne me fais kiffer
Plus rien ne me fais marrer
De la fille du voisin, je suis passé
À de jolies mannequins très convoités
Ma petite amie, elle est belle, elle est bonne
Elle s'appelle Brendy Kylnone, si tu veux je te la donne
Car plus rien ne m'étonne

And Mama, they talk all around town say that 
Papa had three outside children and another wife 
And that ain't right.
Heard them talkin' about Papa doing some storefront preachin'
Talkin' about saving your souls and all the time weak, dealin' in death
And stealin' in the name of the Lord

Papa was a rollin' stone.
Wherever he laid his head was his home.

Hey, Mama, I heard Papa call himself a jack of all trades.
Tell me, is that what sent Papa to an early grave?
Folks say Papa would beg; borrow or steal to pay his bills.
Hey, Mama, folks say Papa was never much on thinkin';
Spend most of his time chasin' women and drinkin'!

A-lors je dois faire sem-blant d'être heu-reux et d'faire des - textes joy-eux
Que faire kif-fer les gens de sept à soi-xante-dix-sept - ans

We chillin' with Doc he brought us over into France know what I mean
We cold kickin' an' chillin' havin' a real good time

J'vais foutre que dalle si je reste seul, la ville s'emballe, mais je reste seul
Faut suivre la mode des boîtes les files de bagnoles,
Plus en plus seul devant mon verre d'alcool,
Alors je dois faire semblant d'être heureux et d'faire des textes joyeux,
Que faire kiffer les gens de 7 à 77 ans, moi dans la ville, je reste seul, indépendant,
Être obligé d'écouter les couplets, si t'es pressé j'vais te faire ton refrain préféré,
J'm'étais marié avec le public, j'voulais chanter des problèmes politiques,
Aider la vie avec ma musique ce que tu attends c'que tu ressens c'est ce que j'm'imite

Hey boy, t'es tellement seul ce soir
Hey boy tu peux compter sur moi,
Hey boy t'es tellement seul ce soir
Personne il n'y a, mais tu peux compter sur moi

Hey boy, t'es tellement seul ce soir
Hey boy tu peux compter sur moi,
Hey boy t'es tellement seul ce soir
Personne il n'y a, mais tu peux compter sur moi

I took a flight to France
To make'em jump up, to make'em wiggle and dance
Now who in command, I got to promise I got to promise I got to promise
That I'm coming back, free world where it's all about peace
Who got my back wave your hands to that, that white and black creed whatever
That you do sing the rap with that cruz Dogg pound DPG Daz just call me Dillinger
Glad that you made it, the whole world was expecting it, jump up clap your hands,
Stamp your feet and get real with it he way that we party your know
We staying real with it my man Doc scooped me up and put me on a block
Stopped the watch and said to party don't stop

Hey boy, t'es tellement seul ce soir
Hey boy tu peux compter sur moi,
Hey boy t'es tellement seul ce soir
Personne il n'y a, mais tu peux compter sur moi

Hey boy, t'es tellement seul ce soir
Hey boy tu peux compter sur moi,
Hey boy t'es tellement seul ce soir
Personne il n'y a, mais tu peux compter sur moi

J'ai commencé par écrire et j'ai chanté
Jamais jamais j'aurai cru rapporté du blé
J'me suis fait arnaquer mais vous savez
Que le plus important c'est que le message est passé.
Première Consultation liaison Quality Street
De l'amour à donner, du papier à brûler
Chacun son truc, je connais mon rayon
J'ai juste besoin d'une feuille et d'un crayon,
C'qu'il y a de plus à dur à faire, mener une vie honnête
Être un rebelle mais toujours droit dans sa tête
Le rap hardcore ça m'impressionne pas
Je kiffe sur le travailleur qui élève sa millefa
Sur le scarla, qui achète une maison à sa mama
Tu sais ce que j'attends tu sais ce que je ressens mais j'me sens seul tellement
Seul personne à rappeler, solitaire je pourrais pleurer

Hey boy, t'es tellement seul ce soir
Hey boy tu peux compter sur moi,
Hey boy t'es tellement seul ce soir
Personne il n'y a, mais tu peux compter sur moi

Hey boy, t'es tellement seul ce soir
Hey boy tu peux compter sur moi,
Hey boy t'es tellement seul ce soir

Doc Gyneco,"Mes baskets blanches, mes locks, l'encre a coulé comme le Trois Rivières 
Au fond des blocs, enfants des îles, fils d'une classe ouvrière 
L'idole des jeunes, Doc restera le même de Porte de la Chapelle, aux ondes hertziennes 

À l'heure où le monde se bouscule 
Je repasse ma vie à l'envers 
J'en ai fait des rêves, des calculs 
J'ai jamais voulu vraiment me laisser faire (jamais, jamais, jamais, jamais)

Et le temps passe, non je ne regrette rien (non rien de rien, je ne regrette rien) 
Rien ne s'efface, mon destin me ressemble bien (nos rêves, nos poings ont guidé nos refrains)
Et le temps passe, pourtant, je ne regrette rien (non rien de rien, je ne regrette rien)
La moindre trace, je l'ai bâtie de mes mains (mes rêves, nos poings, ont guidé nos destins) 

Mes baskets blanche, mon RER, l'encre a coulé dans ma carrière 
À temps plein, viser le haut, contemple mon temple est légendaire 
Mon air A.M.E.R, mon teint, mes rêves sont restés les mêmes 
J'ai tant porté le flambeau, représenté l'honneur des miens 

Mes baskets blanches, ma grande gueule, de l'encre sur les mains
Mon stylo était meurtri et coupable ennemi numéro un
Entre merde et pertes blanches, j'ai le goût pour la revanche
Boxeur, breakeur, rappeur, acteur, attitude franche 

J'ai chanté les Hommes, leurs désirs 
Les destins fragiles et l'amour (je suis né dans la rue)
On a voulu que j' tombe sur place 
Moi, j'ai souvent fait face et je combats toujours (le combat continue)

Et le temps passe, non je ne regrette rien (non rien de rien, je ne regrette rien) 
Rien ne s'efface, mon destin me ressemble bien (nos rêves, nos poings ont guidé nos refrains)
Et le temps passe, pourtant, je ne regrette rien (non rien de rien, je ne regrette rien)
La moindre trace, je l'ai bâtie de mes mains (mes rêves, nos poings, ont guidé nos destins) 

Dis l'heure de Hip Hop Rock 
Des burnes dans le froc 
Fusion guitares et pe-ra pour civils et colboques 
Ministère, Johnny 
Aussi burnés qu'un keuf sous Sarkozy 
Liberté dans ma musique et l'savoir comme Uzi 
Baskets blanches et blousons noirs, génération, manque d'espoir 
Exempté de conneries, que ce gardien me foute la paix 
Lascars abandonnés, j'ai le rêve des cités dortoirs 
Mon rap tout-terrain, mon R.T.T, c'est ça qui est la vérité 

L'être humain porte en lui le meilleur (ouais) 
Je sens encore le poids de mes erreurs, de mes erreurs (ouais)
Le pire a si souvent été là 
La peine guidait mes pas mais je la garde au fond de moi (jusqu'au dernier souffle)

Et le temps passe, non je ne regrette rien (non rien de rien, je ne regrette rien) 
Non, rien ne s'efface, mon destin me ressemble bien (nos rêves, nos poings ont guidé nos refrains)
Et le temps passe, pourtant, je ne regrette rien (non rien de rien, je ne regrette rien)
La moindre trace, je l'ai bâtie de mes mains (mes rêves, nos poings, ont guidé nos destins) 

Et le temps passe, non je ne regrette rien (Ministère A.M.E.R, Johnny Hallyday)
Rien ne s'efface, mon destin me ressemble bien (nos rêves, nos poings ont guidé nos refrains)
Et le temps passe, pourtant, je ne regrette rien (non rien de rien, je ne regrette rien)
La moindre trace, je l'ai bâtie de mes mains (mes rêves, nos poings, ont guidé nos destins)

Il y a aussi des gens qui essayent de rentrer 
Mais ils sont fouillés à l’entrée 
Partout des bases militaires

Ils ont un fusil sur le mur 
Ils veulent qu’on fasse nos bagages

Doc Holiday,"Placed in the wilderness, naked and cold
The night draws the warmth from my flesh
Howls in the distance
The wolves they catch my scent
They yearn for my blood warm and fresh

But I 

Cannot run, I cannot hide
I'm moments old, yet terrified
Snarling breath is on my face
I am damned in this place

Morning breaks the evening darkness
Daylight sings so loud
Father holds my in his arms
And laughs for he is proud
'All is well' my mother cries
A kiss for me her child
But at night my heart turns black
And calls me to the wild

In the night where the wolf-bane grows
In the night when the full moon glows

Cry wolf 

Alone in your room
By the light of the moon
Your glory is shining so bright
You prey for the day
Oh show me the way
The devil takes over tonight
It's too late, night is here
The time that you dread
The time when you loose all control

Your bodies in pain
You cry in vein
Satan takes over your soul

Cry wolf 

Even a man who's pure of heart
He says his prayers by night
Bane from a wolf when the wolf bane grows
And the moon's full and bright

I cannot resist their call
It strengthens as I age
To the pack to join the feast
And fear immortal rage
Never can I live the life
Of every normal child
Forever I must answer
To the call of the wild

The call of the wild",Cry of the Wolf,

Got a ticket to my destination. 
On a tour of one-night stands my suitcase and guitar in hand. 
And ev'ry stop is neatly planned for a poet and a one-man band.

I wish I was, 
Homeward bound, 
Home where my thought's escaping, 
Home where my music's playing, 
Home where my love lies waiting 
Silently for me. 
Ev'ry day's an endless stream 
Of cigarettes and magazines. 
And each town looks the same to me, the movies and the factories 
And ev'ry stranger's face I see reminds me that I long to be, 
Homeward bound, 
I wish I was, 
Homeward bound, 
Home where my thought's escaping, 
Home where my music's playing, 
Home where my love lies waiting 
Silently for me. 

Tonight I'll sing my songs again, 
I'll play the game and pretend. 
But all my words come back to me in shades of mediocrity 
Like emptiness in harmony I need someone to comfort me.

Clouds are feathers from a lady's fan
Do you remember how we watched them drifting by
Long ago when love began
 
Clouds floating thru the night 
While the silver stars above
Lend their tender light 
Clouds drifting thru the sky
While I wonder why my love ever said goodbye
The night was young
The breeze was warm and tender
A fool was I but how was I to know
I gladly gave my heart in sweet surrender
To learn that love was meant to come and go 
Like snowhite clouds floating through the night 
Speaking of a love that was heavenly 
A love that could never be mine
 
Once we were together and now we're apart
Did you find it easy to forget?
I keep on dreaming while the years go drifting by
Calling you my ""Sweet Regret""
 
Clouds floating thru the night 
While the silver stars above
Lend their tender light 
Clouds drifting thru the sky
While I wonder why my love ever said goodbye

Little coquette, making fun of the one who loves you
Breaking hearts you are ruling
Little coquette, true hearts tenderly dreaming of you.
Someday you'll fall in love as I fell in love with you.
Maybe the one you love will just be fooling too.
And when you are alone with all your regrets, 
You know, my little coquette, I love you.

Someone is sharing my memories
Wonder does she grieve
Every lovely evening
 
In a little Spanish town
'Twas on a night like this
Stars were peek-a-booing down
'Twas on a night like this
I whispered ""Be true to me""
And she sighed: ""Si, Si""
Many skies have turned to gray
Because we're far apart
Many moons had passed away
And still she's in my heart
We made a promise and sealed it with a kiss
In a little Spanish town
'Twas on a night like this
 
Somehow I keep on remembering
Tears that said goodbye
Shining in her eye
Wonder does she keep remembering
Promises of mine
When the moon is shining

Doc Severinsen,"As a tot, when I trotted in little velvet panties,
I was kissed by my sisters, my cousins, and my aunties.
Sad to tell, it was hell, an inferno worse than Dante's.

So my dear I swore,
""Never, never more!""
On my list, I insisted that kissing must be crossed out.
Now, I find I was blind, and oh my! 
How I lost out!

I could cry salty tears,
Where have I been all these years?
Little wow, tell me now,
How long has this been going on?

There were chills up my spine,
And some thrills I can't define.
Listen, sweet, I repeat,
How long has this been going on?

Oh, I feel that I could melt,
Into Heaven I'm hurled!
I know how Columbus felt,
Finding another world.

Kiss me once, then once more.
What a dunce I was before.
What a break! 
For Heaven's sake!
How long has this been going on?

Dear, when in your arms I creep,
That divine rendezvous,
Don't wake me, if I'm asleep,
Let me dream that it's true!

Kiss me twice, then once more.
That makes thrice, let's make it four!
What a break! 
For Heaven's sake!

But now I hear love call,
I'm getting sentimental over you

Things you say and do,
Just thrill me through and through,
I'm getting sentimental over you.

I thought I was happy,
I could live without love
Now I must admit,
Love is all I'm thinking of

Won't you please be kind,
And just make up your mind
That you'll be sweet & gentle,

Doc Severinsen,"When I hear that Serenade in blue
I'm somewhere in another world, alone with you
Sharing all the joys we used to know
Many moons ago

Once again your face comes back to me
Just like the theme of some forgotten melody
In the album of my memory
Serenade in blue

It seems like only yesterday
The small cafe, a crowded floor
And as we danced the night away
I hear you say forever more
And then the song became a sigh
Forever more became goodbye
Cause you remained in my heart, but

Tell me darling in there still a spark?
Or only lonely ashes of the flame we knew
Should I go on whistling in the dark,
Serenade in blue",Serenade in Blue,1988
Doc Severinsen,"And now the purple dusk of twilight time
Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb
Always reminding me that we're apart
You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms

Tells his fairytale
Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain
My stardust melody
The memory of love's refrain.",Stardust,1988

Now Santa is a busy man, He has no time to play
He's got millions of stockings to fill on Christmas day
You'd better write your letter now
And mail it right away
Because he's getting ready
His reindeer's and his sleigh. So
 
[Chorus]
 
With little tin horns and little toy drums
Rooty toot toots and rummy tum tums
Santa Claus is comin' to town
And curly head dolls that toddle and coo
Elephants, boats, and kiddie cars too
Santa Claus is comin' to town
Then kids in Girl and Boy land will have a jubilee
They're gonna build a Toyland all around the Christmas tree
So! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town",Santa Claus Is Coming to Town,1991

That you'd turn away romance
Are you pretending

You know I'm yours for just the taking

Trying to figure who's right and who's wrong
Now the kid is gone
I sit belted up tight

Steering on

And I might be more of a man
If I stopped this in its tracks and say come on
Lets go home
But she's got the wheel
I've got nothing except what I have on

When you're swimming with your boots on

And it's hard to say you don't

Trying to steer the conversation from
The thing we've done
She shuts up the ashtray
And I say it's a long way back now huh
But she just yawns

When you're swimming with your boots on

And it's hard to say you don't

Unless the moon falls tonight.
Unless continence collides

But the midway rides are almost still
The tilt-a-whirl and the ferris wheel are gone
As I run my fingers through your golden hair
The air's gettin' cold 
And leaves are fallin' everywhere

And we've got one last sundown
So won't you lay your head down
I don't wanna hear 'goodbye'
I just want you by my side
For just one last sundown

Every waking moment since we've met
We've never been more that a couple of steps apart
And tomorrow just won't be the same
Pack up all your summer things in the car

We never said it
But we knew it couldn't last
But we didn't know
That this night would come so fast

Now we've got one last sundown
So won't you lay your head down
I don't wanna hear 'goodbye'
I just want you by my side
For just one last sundown

I'll give you more gold than your apron can hold
If you'll only let your hair hang low

But the field of hay was soon cut down
In a short few weeks it all was past

And the snowflakes covered her head
Let me come in, she feebly said
Please give me a little bread

As the little girl still trembling stood
Before that rich man's door
With a frowning face he scornfully said
No room, no bread for the poor

Then the rich man went to his table so fine
Where he and his family were fed
And the orphan stood in the snow so deep
As she cried for a piece of bread

The rich man slept on his velvet couch
And he dreamed of his silver and gold
While the orphan lay in a bed of snow
And murmured, so cold, so cold

The hours rolled on through the midnight storm
Rolled on like a funeral bell
The sleet came down in a blinding sheet
And the drifting snow still fell

Still lay at the rich man's door
But her soul had fled away to its home
Where there's room and there's bread for the poor",Little Orphan Girl,1973

Came to the old oak tree
It stands beside the river
Where you were to meet me

On the ground your glove I found
With a note addressed to me
It read ""Dear Love, I've done you wrong,
Now I must set you free""

No longer can I live
With this hurt and this sin
I just couldn't tell you
That guy was just a friend

Than the vainest knife

I looked into the muddy waters
And what did I see
I saw a lonely, lonely face
Just looking back at me

Ang a prayer on his lips
And the glove of his lost love
At his finger tips

How John Lewis did murder poor little Omie Wise.

He promised her money and other fine things.

So, fool-like she met him at Adams's Springs.
No money he brought her nor other fine things.

""Go with me, little Omie, and away we will go.
We'll go and get married and no one will know.""

She climbed up behind him and away they did go,
But off to the river where deep waters flow.

""John Lewis, John Lewis, will you tell me your mind?
Do you intend to marry me or leave me behind?""

""Little Omie, little Omie, I'll tell you my mind.
My mind is to drown you and leave you behind.""

""Have mercy on my baby and spare me my life,
I'll go home as a beggar and never be your wife.""

He kissed her and hugged her and turned her around,
Then pushed her in deep waters where he knew that she would drown.

He got on his pony and away he did ride,
As the screams of little Omie went down by his side.

T'was on a Thursday morning, the rain was pouring down,
When the people searched for Omie but she could not be found.

Two boys went a-fishin' one fine summer day,
And saw little Omie's body go floating away.

They threw their net around her and drew her to the bank.
Her clothes all wet and muddy, they laid her on a plank.

Then sent for John Lewis to come to that place --
And brought her out before him so that he might see her face.

He made no confession but they carried him to jail,
No friends or relations would go on his bail.

I've smoked 'em all my life and I ain't dead yet
But nicotine slaves are all the same 
At a pheasant party or a poker game
Everything's gotta stop when they have that cigarette

Smoke smoke smoke that cigarette 
Puff puff puff 
And if you smoke yourself to death
Tell St Peter at the Golden Gate 
That you hate to make him wait
But you just gotta have another cigarette

Now at a game of chance the other night 
Ol' Dame Forson wasn't doin' me right
Them kings and queens just kept on comin' round
Well I got a full and I bet it high 
But my plug didn't work on a certain guy
He just kept a risin' and a layin' that money down
He's raise me and I'd raise him 
I sweated blood I had to sink or swim
He finally called and he didn't raise the bet
I said ""aces is full pal how about you?"" 
He said ""I'll tell you in a minute or two
But I just gotta have another cigarette""

Smoke smoke smoke that cigarette 
Puff puff puff 
And if you smoke yourself to death
Tell St Peter at the Golden Gate 
That you hate to make him wait
But you just gotta have another cigarette

The other night I had a date with 
The cutest gal in the fifty states
A high bred uptown social little dame
She said she loved me and it seemed to me 
That things were like they ought a be
So hand in hand we strolled down Lover's Lane
She was oh so far from a chunk of ice 
And our smoochin' party was a goin' real nice
So help and I think I'd of been there yet
But I give her a hug and a little squeeze 
And she said ""Willie excuse me please
But I just gotta have another cigarette""
Smoke smoke smoke that cigarette 
Puff puff puff 
And if you smoke yourself to death
Tell St Peter at the Golden Gate 
That you hate to make him wait
But you just gotta have another cigarette
Smoke smoke smoke that cigarette 
Puff puff puff 
And if you smoke yourself to death
Tell St Peter at the Golden Gate 
That you hate to make him wait
But you just gotta have another cigarette
Just gotta have another cigarette","Smoke, Smoke, Smoke",1981

While I've got money to spend
Tomorrow might be Monday 
And I'd neither have a dollar nor a friend 
Well I've got plenty of money in my pocket
My good time friends are around 
But as soon as my pocketbook is empty
Not a friend on this earth can be found 
I wrote my little woman a letter good people
And I told her I was in jail
She sent me back an answer
Sayin honey I'm a coming go your bail
But I'm still walking round 
This old jail house this evening
Forty dollars won't pay my fine
Corn whiskey has surrounded my body poor boy
And my woman is troubling my mind
Lord my daddy told me a pretty good people
And my momma she told me more
Said son if you don't quit your rowdy ways
You'll have trouble at your door
If it wasn't for heartaches and trouble good people
Lord I would not be here today
I will ramble this whole world over
At home I cannot stay
Give me corn bread
On the table when I'm hungry
Something tall and cool when I'm dry
And a true loving woman to stand by me
Sweet heaven when I die
Go dig a hole in the meadow good people
Make it deep in that cold cold ground
Then gather around all you kind friends 
And see this poor rounder go down
And when I'm dead and they buried me
With my pale face turned to the sun
Will you stand around and moan little woman
And think of the way you have done

While i wait for better days 
I could use a place to stay 
Or a floor where I could lay my blanket down 
If I could beg, steal, or borrow 
A ticket on some boat or plane 
I'd be leaving London tomorrow 
To fly to my young love again 
Up at dawn to change my shirt 
And to wash away the dirt

Doc Watson,"There is a house down in New Orleans
They call the Rising Sun
And it's been the ruin of a many poor boy
And me, oh God, for one

Then fill the glasses to the brim
Let the drinks go merrily around
And we'll drink to the health of a rounder poor boy
Who goes from town to town

The only thing that a rounder needs
Is a suitcase and a trunk
And the only time he's satisfied
Is when he's on a drunk

Now boys, don't believe what a girl tells you
Though her eyes be blue or brown
Unless she's on some scaffold high
Saying, ""Boys, I can't come down""

Go tell my youngest brother
Not to do the things I've done
But to shun that house down in New Orleans
They call the Rising Sun

I'm going back, back to New Orleans
For my race is nearly run
Gonna spend the rest of my wicked life
Beneath that Rising Sun

Doc Watson,"Can you tell me what happened to the blossom
Blackberry blossom when the summertime came?
The blackberry blossom, oh the last time I saw one
Was down in the bramble where I rambled in the spring
The bramble was wild I was torn by the briars
My love he wooed me as I lie there
With a flower in my hair and my cheeks all flashy 
Was the blackberry blossom from the blackberry bush 

When I picked the berry I didn't miss the blossom 
The blackberry blossom was white as the snow 
But the berry that it brings is sweeter than molasses 
And black as the wings of the Arkansas crow 
The Arkansas crow is a devil and a demon 
Known for his cackling and his screaming 
Driving away the swallow and the thrush 
From the blackberry blossom and the blackberry bush  

I was picking berries when that crow flew above me 
Carrying my lover so far away 
Now each spring I lay a blackberry blossom 
By a cold gravestone on the Arkansas clay 
The Arkansas clay is rocky and hard 
With weeds growing over in the old graveyard 
And the day settles down to an evening hush  
Over the blackberry blossom and the blackberry bush",Blackberry Blossom,1990
Doc Watson,"Tempted and tried, we're oft made to wonder
Why it should be thus all the day long;
While there are others living about us,
Never molested, though in the wrong.

Then do we wonder why others prosper,
Living so wicked year after year.

Cheer up, my brother, live in the sunshine,

Go in the rain, the cold, and the snow,
When there are many living in comfort,
Giving no heed to all I can do.

A few more days to labor and wait;
Then will our toiling seem to be nothing,
When we shall pass the heavenly gate.

When he heard his little child scream.

""Please, daddy, don't go to the mines today,
For dreams have so often come true.
My daddy, my daddy, please don't go away,

And the men all fought for their lives.

Was covered with sweethearts and wives.""

Man as me",St. James Infirmary,1992
Doc Watson,"1. If I had listened t'what Mama said,
I would not have been here today;
Wishing for things I'll never have,
And weeping my sweet life away.

cho: If I was on some foggy mountain top,
I'd sail away to the West
I'd sail all around this old wide world
To the one I love the best.

2. You caused me to weep, you caused me to mourn,
You caused me to leave my home;
Oh, that lonesome pine and those good old times,
I'm on my way back home.

cho....

3. Oh, when you see that two-faced blonde,
There's somethin' you can tell 'er;
She need not fool her time away,
A-tryin' to steal a feller.

cho....

4. Oh, when you come to courtin' now,
Put on you navy blue;
That long tail ""roust-a-bout"" you wear,
Don't do a thing for you.

cho....



",Foggy Mountain Top,1993
Doc Watson,"[Chorus]
Memories of you, sweetheart, still haunt me so
Everytime I hear your name I almost cry
But, there's just one thing that I want you to know
I'll love you till the day I die

Oh, we let other people tear us apart
And for no good cause you see
But, I hope and pray you'll be mine someday
You'll live and love each other, you and me

So if you go, don't say goodbye
For you know just what you will cause
Don't leave me here to face this lonesome world
For without you I'm the one that is lost

I'll leave you anytime you say
But when I'm gone, no more to see you

I tried to tell you how I loved you
And I tried to prove it night and day
But when I'm gone, no more to see you

Doc Watson,"Way downtown just foolin' around
Took me to the jail
It's oh me and it's oh my
No one to go my bail

It was late last night when Willie came home
I heard him a-rapping on the door
He's a-slipping and a-sliding with his new shoes on
Mamma said Willie don't you rap no more

Way downtown just foolin' around
Took me to the jail
It's oh me and it's oh my
No one to go my bail

I wish I was over at my sweet Sally's house
Sittin' in that big armed chair
One arm around this old guitar
And the other one around my dear

Way down town just foolin' around
Took me to the jail
It's oh me and it's oh my
No one to go my bail

Now, its one old shirt is all that I got
And a dollar is all that I crave
I brought nothing with me into this old world

",Way Downtown,1994
Doc Watson,"I've always heard there is a land
Beyond the mortal dreams of man
Where every tear will be left behind
But it must be in another time

There'll be an everlasting light
Shining a purest holy white
And every fear will be erased
But it must be in another place

So, I'm waiting for another time and another place
Where all my hopes and dreams will be captured
With one look at Jesus' face
Oh, my heart's been burnin'
My soul keeps yearnin'
Sometimes I can't hardly wait
For that sweet, sweet someday
When I'll be swept away
To another time and another place

I've grown so tired of earthly things
They promise peace but furnish pain
All of life's sweetest joys combined
Could never match those in another time
And though I've put my trust in Christ
And felt His Spirit move in my life
I know it's truly just a taste
Of His glory in another place","Another Time, Another Place",1994
Doc Watson,"Chorus:

Walkin' boss
Walkin' boss
Yes you're the boss
But I don't belong to you.

I belong
Yes, I belong
And I can get along
With that steel drivin' crew

When I asked that boss man
For a job
I said I wanna job
He said ""Son, what can you do?""

I can line track
I can line up track
And I can pull a jack
I can pick and shovel too.

One hard day

And just lay around the shanty too

My time is swiftly rolling on
When I must faint and die;
My body to the dust return
And there fergotten lie.
Let persecution rage around
And Antichrist appear;
My silent dust beneath the ground;
There's no disturbance there.

To call poor sinners to repent
And seek their Savior dear.
My brother preachers, boldly speak
And stand on Zion's wall.
Confirm the drunk, confirm the weak
And after sinners call.

My loving wife, my bosom friend,
The object of my love,
The time's been sweet l've spent with you,
My sweet and harmless dove,
My little children near my heart
My warm affections know.
From each the path will I attend.
O from them can I go?!

O God, a father to them be
And keep them from all harm,
That they may love and worship Thee
And dwell upon Thy charm.
How often you have looked fer me
And often seen me come.
But now I must depart from thee
And nevermore return.

My loving wife, don't grieve fer me,
Neither lament nor mourn;
Fer I will with my Jesus be
And dwell upon his charm.

And there forgotten lie.
Let persecutions rage around,
Let Antichrist appear;
Beneath the cold and silent ground
There's no disturbance there.

Through heats and cold I've toiled and went
And wandered in despair;
To call poor sinners to repent
And seek the Savior dear.

My brother preachers, boldly speak
And stand on Zion's wall.
Confirm the strong, revive the weak,
And after sinners call.

My little children, near my heart,
And nature seems to bind,
It grieves me sorely to depart
And leave you here behind.

Oh Lord, a father to them be
And keep them from all harm
That they may love and worship Thee
And dwell upon Thy charm.

The object of my love,
The time's been sweet I spent with thee,
My sweet, my harmless dove.

Though I must now depart from thee
Let this not grieve your heart,
For you will shortly come to me
Where we shall never part.



",Hicks' Farewell,1995
Doc Watson,"Went out one night for to make a little round
I met little Sadie and I shot her down
Went back home and I got in my bed
Forty four pistol under my head

Wake up next morning 'bout a half past nine
The hacks and the buggies all standing in line
Gents and the gamblers standing all round
Taking little Sadie to her burying ground

Then I begin to think what a deed I'd done
I grabbed my hat and away I run
Made a good run but a little too slow
They overtook me in Jericho

I was standing on the corner, reading the bill
When up stepped the sheriff from Thomasville
He said, young man, ain't your name Brown?
Remember the night you shot Sadie down?

I said, yes, sir, my name is Lee
I murdered little Sadie in the first degree
And first degree and the second degree
If you got any papers, won't you read 'em to me?

They took me downtown and dressed me in black
Put me on the train and started me back
They crammed me back in that Thomasville jail
And I had no money for to go my bail

That judge and the jury, they took their stand
The judge had the papers in his right hand
Forty one days and forty one nights
Forty one years to wear the ball and the stripes

Doc Watson,"Step up, buddies, and listen to my song
I'll sing it to you right, but you may sing it wrong,
All about a man named Otto Wood,
I can't tell you all, but I wish I could.

He walked in a pawn shop a rainy day,
And with the clerk he had a quarrel, they say.
Pulled out his pistol and he struck him a blow,
And this is the way the story goes.

They spread the news as fast as they could,
The sheriff served a warrant on Otto Wood.
The jury said murder in the second degree,
And the judge passed the sentence to the penitentiary.

[Chorus]
Otto, why didn't you run?
Otto's done dead and gone.
Otto Wood, why didn't you run
When the sheriff pulled out his 44 gun?

They put him in the pen, but it done no good,
It wouldn't hold the man they call Otto Wood.
It wasn't very long till he slipped outside,
Drawed a gun on the guard, said, ""Take me for a ride.""

Second time they caught him was away out west,
In the holdup game, he got shot through the breast.
They brought him back and when he got well,
They locked him down in a dungeon cell.

He was a man they could not run,
He always carried a 44 gun.
He loved the women and he hated the law,
And he just wouldn't take nobody's jaw.

He rambled out west and he rambled all around,
He met the sheriff in a southern town.
And the sheriff says, ""Otto, step this way,
'Cause I've been expecting you every day.""

He pulled out his gun and then he said,
""If you make a crooked move, you both fall dead.
Crank up your car and take me out of town,""

Not a servant so faithful he'd found

And its hands never hung by its side
But it stopped short never to go again

Then it rang an alarm in the dead of the night
An alarm that for years had been dumb
And we knew that his spirit was pluming for flight
That his hour for departure had come

Doc Watson,"My name is Juanano de Castro
My father was a Spanish Grandee
But I won my wife in a card game
To hell with those lords o'er the sea

Well the South Coast is wild coast and lonely
You might win in a game at Cholon
But a lion still rules the Barranca
And a man there is always alone

I played in a card game at Jolon
I played there with an outlaw named Juan
And after I'd taken his money
I staked all against his daughter Dawn
I picked up the ace...l had won her
My heart it was down at my feet
Jumped up to my throat in a hurry
Like a young summer's day she was sweet
He opened the door to the kitchen
And he called the girl out with a curse
Saying ""Take her, Goddamn her, you've won her
She's yours now for better or worse""
Her arms had to tighten around me
As we rode down the hills to the south
Not a word did I hear from her that day
Nor a kiss from her pretty young mouth
But that was a gay happy winter
We carved on a cradle of pine
By the fire in that neat little cabin
And I sang with that gay wife of mine

Well the South Coast is wild coast and lonely
You might win in a game at Cholon
But a lion still rules the Barranca
And a man there is always alone

That night I got hurt in a landslide
Crushed hip and twice broken bone
She saddled her pony like lightning
And rode off for the doctor in Cholon
The lion screamed in the Barranca
Buck, he bolted and he fell on his side
My young wife lay dead in the moonlight
My heart died that night with my bride

You might win in a game at Cholon
But a lion still rules the Barranca

Look good going down?

Look good going down?

Get along with you
I'm gonna tell you what I'm going do
I'm gonna quit my crying

And was always his treasure and pride

Not a servant so faithful he'd found
For it wasted no time and it had but one desire
At the close of each week to be wound
Yes it kept in its place but not a frown upon its face
And its hands never hung by its side
But it stopped short never to go again
When the old man died

Then it rang an alarm in the dead of the night
An alarm that for years had been dumb
And we knew that his spirit was pluming for flight
That his hour for departure had come

And there fergotten lie.

And Antichrist appear;
My silent dust beneath the ground;

And seek their Savior dear.

And stand on Zion's wall.

And after sinners call.

My sweet and harmless dove,

My warm affections know.
From each the path will I attend.
O from them can I go?!

O God, a father to them be
And keep them from all harm,
That they may love and worship Thee
And dwell upon Thy charm.
How often you have looked fer me
And often seen me come.
But now I must depart from thee
And nevermore return.

Neither lament nor mourn;

",Hicks' Farewell,
Doc Watson & Family,"Oh, listen to my story, I'll tell you no lies,
How John Lewis did murder poor little Omie Wise.
He told her to meet him at Adams's Springs.
He promised her money and other fine things.

So, fool-like she met him at Adams's Springs.
No money he brought her nor other fine things.

""Go with me, little Omie, and away we will go.
We'll go and get married and no one will know.""

She climbed up behind him and away they did go,
But off to the river where deep waters flow.

""John Lewis, John Lewis, will you tell me your mind?
Do you intend to marry me or leave me behind?""

""Little Omie, little Omie, I'll tell you my mind.
My mind is to drown you and leave you behind.""

""Have mercy on my baby and spare me my life,
I'll go home as a beggar and never be your wife.""

He kissed her and hugged her and turned her around,
Then pushed her in deep waters where he knew that she would drown.

He got on his pony and away he did ride,
As the screams of little Omie went down by his side.

T'was on a Thursday morning, the rain was pouring down,
When the people searched for Omie but she could not be found.

Two boys went a-fishin' one fine summer day,
And saw little Omie's body go floating away.

They threw their net around her and drew her to the bank.
Her clothes all wet and muddy, they laid her on a plank.

Then sent for John Lewis to come to that place --
And brought her out before him so that he might see her face.

He made no confession but they carried him to jail,
No friends or relations would go on his bail.

With a low-down sorry man.

I wrote my woman a letter, good people,
I told her I was in jail.
She wrote me back an answer
Saying ""Honey, I'm a-coming to go your bail.""

All around this old jailhouse is haunted good people,
Forty dollars won't pay my fine.
Corn whisky has surrounded my body, poor boy,
Pretty women is a-troubling my mind.

Boys, if you don't quit your drinking
Some time you'll be just like me;
A working out your living
In the penitentiary.

Oh my daddy taught me a-plenty, good people,
My mama, she told me more.
If I didn't quit my rowdy ways
I'd have trouble at my door.

In the bottom of the whisky glass,
The lurking devil dwells.
It burns your breast to drink it, boys;
It'll send your soul to Hell.

Go dig a hole in the meadow, good people,
Go did a hole in the ground.
Come around all you good people
And see this poor rounder go down.

When I am dead and buried
And my pale face turned to the sun,
You can come around and mourn, little woman,
And think the way you have done",Country Blues,1998
Dockhead Choir,"Oh
And the rain? tossed about us;
In the garden of the world
But a flame arrives to guide us;
Past the gold between the anvils of the stars

Watch you over all the children in the rain;
And the streets where I remember
Where the fire lights
Are candle souls again;

Affirming flame,
Hear me call;
Through the darkness,
Hear it call to us all

And stir again;
This beating heart
Comes again

Oh
And the drive out all our fears
And the joy drive out our pain
And the nations come to greet us
Waving open arms like waves of golden corn

Ever hear us,
Oh, the spirit of the world
May your light be ever near us
Always lead us from the dark
Though we may fall

We will fly
And with love
Ever call",Caliban's Dream,2012

Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb
Always reminding me that we're apart
You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms
The nightingale 
Tells his fairytale
Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain
My stardust melody
The memory of love's refrain.",Stardust,1988

I've been up for half a week
Watching night turn into day
Spending all my hard earned pay
On bitches, bills, this and that
Leave the phone where it's at

[Chorus:]

Reach out and torment someone
Reach out and show 'em you don't care
Reach out and torment someone
Reach out and show 'em you don't care

Credit cards are overdrawn
When I call that bitch she's never home
But when I'm swimming in the cash
She's always there to give me ass
Bought her clothes, fed her face
That's the price for getting laid
When I think I'm over it all
That's when I get that fucking call

[Chorus]

[Calls]

[Chorus x2]





",Reach Out and Torment Someone,1994
Doctor Butcher,"Wish I never been born at all,
To this world that seems so cold
You know there must be another way,
To make things different than they are today

Time slipping away,
What once was green is now burning away
It all comes back to you

All these Bridges lead the way
To the place that we all live today
Now the times have changed,
Can't seem to get along
Noone's right, when everyone's wrong

Air pollution, no solution, ozone's ruined
Claiming a life everyday
Now you've got needles on the beach,
AIDS in the streets
No heroes left to save this dying day

Time slipping away,
What once was green is now burning away

It points the finger to you

All these Bridges lead the way
To the place that we all live today
Now the times have changed,
Can't seem to get along
Noone's right, when everyone's wrong

I guess it's all been said before,
The answers lie behind the door
I guess it's really up to you,
To make it different than we already know

Time slipping away,
What once was green is now burning away
It's all up to you

All these Bridges lead the way
To the place that we all live today
Now the times have changed,
Can't seem to get along
Noone's right, when everyone's wrong",Bridges,2000

Doctor Dré,"A man in my shoes runs a light
And all the papers lied tonight
But falling over you
Is the news of the day
Angels fall like rain
And love is all of heaven away

Inside you the time moves
And she don't fade
The ghost in you
She don't fade
Inside you the time moves
And she don't fade

A race is on I'm on your side
And hearing you my engines die
I'm in a mood for you
For running away
Stars come down in you
And love, you can't give it away

Inside you the time moves
And she don't fade
The ghost in you
She don't fade
Inside you the time moves
And she don't fade

Don't you go
It makes no sense
When all your talking supermen
Just take away the time
And get in the way
Ain't it just like rain
And love is only heaven away

And she don't fade

Doctor E,"Maybe I should have saved those left over dreams
Funny, but here's that rainy day
Here's that rainy day they told me about
And I laughed at the thought that it might turn out this way

Where is that worn out wish that I threw aside
After it brought my lover near
It's funny how love becomes a cold rainy day
Funny, that rainy day is here

They're cooking for the down five
Who're staring at Miss Rayon

Who just got back from Carolina

He says he's from Alabama
He wants to know a way to earn a dollar

Cecil's got his new piece
He cocks and shoots between three and four
He aims it at the sailor
Shoots him down dead on the floor
Oh, you shouldn't do that
Don't you know, you'll stain the carpet?
Now don't you know you'll stain the carpet
And by the way, have you got a dollar
Oh, no, man, I haven't got the time time
Too busy sucking on a ding-dong

Oh, she does just like Sister Ray said
I'm searching for my mainline
I said I couldn't hit it sideways
Oh, couldn't, couldn't hit it sideways
Oh it, it just, just all over the floor, the floor

Now, who's that knocking
Who's that knocking on my chamber door
Now could it be the police
They come to take me for a ride ride
Oh, but I haven't got the time time
Hey, hey, hey she's busy sucking on my ding-dong

I wouldn't pick track nine if I was you
The easy way gets harder all the time

Big deal, a little ache 
In the city of hate
Deep in the big black heart 
Of the lonestar state
If you are a good old boy
They're gonna do you fine
The easy way gets harder all the time

Speaking of love
Speaking of love

Two times shame on you exponentially
Fool me again baby
And you can say ""shame on me""
How can I love you
When you won't be mine

Speaking of love
What will you do 
When this is done
Will your run
Will you stay
Met me at the easy way

How can I love you
When you won't be mine
The easy way gets harder all the time
Time, time, time!

And the love you give
Is enough to stay
It's so hard to live
Meet me at the easy way

Meet me in your room
Meet me in your car
Meet me on the moon

If I told you I loved you

If I told you I loved you

From some enchanted land.
Down deep in my heart, I hear it say,

That's hard to see, how many names such as this
For they both have the very same sensation
When you're locked in the magic of a kiss

Is lonely and silent, the shades are all drawn,
And my heart is heavy as I gaze upon

The lawn we were proud of is waving in hay,
Our beautiful garden has withered away,
Where you planted roses,the weeds seem to say,
A cottage for sale.

From every single window, I see your face,
But when I reach a window, there's empty space.
The key's in the mail box the same as before,
But no one is waiting any more,

I guess I'll go through life 
Just catchin' colds and missin' trains

Everything happens to me
I never miss a thing
I've had the measles and the mumps
And every time I play an ace
My partner always trumps
Guess I'm just a fool who never looks before he jumps

Everything happens to me
At first my heart thought you could break this jinx for me
That love would turn the trick to end despair
But know I just can't fool this head that thinks for me
I've mortgaged all my castles in the air
I've telegraphed and phoned
I send an ""Airmail Special"" too

And then it had to be with you

A little room where all the roses bloom
I want to lead you into Nature's hall
Where ev'ry year the roses give a ball
They have an orchestra up in the trees
For their musicians are the birds and bees
And they will sing us a song
As we are strolling along
 
In sunny Roseland, where summer breezes are playing
Where the honey bees are ""A-Maying""
There all the roses are swaying
Dancing while the meadow brook flows
The moon when shining is more than ever designing
For 'tis ever then I am pining
Pining to be sweetly reclining
Somewhere in Roseland
Beside a beautiful rose
 
The ball is over and tulips meet
Their little kisses are so short and sweet
The lilies nod to the forget-me-nots
When they're departing in their flower pots
But all the roses with their spirits high
Remain to love until they droop and die

Doe B,"This a Tennesse, Alabama, Atlanta connection homeboy

Let me find out these niggas still hating on the low
And their whole life savings I get paid for a show
Their re-up, that's my walk-through
My sneakers, there they house note
Think I need a whole thang of Keisha just to talk to 'em
Small town, big money, baby I make boss moves
They say Doe B lane is like T-Pain without the auto-tune
Bring out the Apollo boom
I'mma sandman these niggas
Give you 2 thumbs down
Boy, your swag ain't official
Let me find out them fake Guccis
Let me find out them fake Louis
Let me find out your baby mama is a man-eater, she ate my children
Let me find out you fake juug and I come through like, ""Aye buddy
You 25, just started trapping?""
Let me find out you straight rookie
Taylor Gang, straight trippy
Hustle Gang what it is, pimping?
Got so many white friends I bring back Tommy Hilfiger
A-T-L, let me find out
Memphis Ten', let me find out
M.I.A., N-Y-C, Texas, Cali, Chi-Town

Let me find out
Let me find out
Nigga let me find out
Let me find, out

Let me find out
Let me find out
Nigga let me find out
Let me find, out

Let me find out & I'm ridin' out
Got 4 choppers no 9's out
I'm recent, you're timed out
I'm playin' with it, you fouled out
You got a foul mouth, you'll get 2 shots
Nigga and one with my handgun
Nigga talk about dough but that's something
You ain't never had your hands on
Got folk in Alabama, they still call me Arm & Hammer
See I do it for the
Gutter, not just to get the glamor
Hey who that nigga from Atlanta say he got a lot of drugs?
Say you looking
For a plug, bitch you looking at the plug
I'mma, real young nigga
You want this ho, better come get her
We don't want your bitch man
We just wanna have fun with her
Okay well let me find out you channeled it
Ridin' around town just saving hoes
Nigga she ain't all yours, we shared the bitch
But let me find out
She havin' your baby though

Let me find out

Bitch let me find out

Let me find out, Juicy J's your girl's favorite rapper
I'mma fuck her all night and I'mma give her back after
I ain't hand cuffing these hoes like shackles
For the green & the cheese like a Green Bay packer
Trippy Man, fuck you pay me, I come play like Tom Brady
Kush is my medication, ride presidential like Ronald Reagan
Pussy niggas need to stop hating my flow sick like cancer patients
Rolex and a new Bugatti, yes bitch I'm ice skating
My last bitch must've been a chauffeur, she drove me crazy
No key, that space age, my ignition, I done made it
Juicy J, that's trippy ho, Taylor Gang that's trippy ho
Smoking on that Christmas tree my belt buckle like mistletoe
Who stands with your wife?
She just spent the night
With my dick in her mouth & my balls in her hand
Like the bitch was shooting dice
Juicy J, I got long money
I got 1998 song money
Bitch pour that Patron for me
I rock shows, boy I'm stone money

Let me find out (lemme find out you nigga isn't who you say you is)
Let me find out (haha you niggas nobody man)
Nigga let me find out
(Lemme find out you sold your soul for them joint nigga)

Shots fired, man down, what happened?

Two shooters, you dummy, I'm coming, get the money

I watch them bloom for me and you
And I think to myself, what a wonderful world

I see skies of blue, clouds of white
The bright blessed day and the dark sacred night
And I think to myself, what a wonderful world

The colors of the rainbow, so pretty in the sky
Are also on the faces of the people passing by
I see friends shaking hands, saying, how do you do?""
What they're really saying is ""I love you.""

They'll know much more than I'll ever know

Have you anything to say to me?
Won't you tell me where my love can be?
Is there a meadow in the mist
Where someone's waiting to be kissed?

Skylark
Have you seen a valley green with spring?
Where my heart can go a journeying
Over the shadows and the rain
To a blossom covered lane

And in your lonely flight
Haven't you heard the music in the night?
Wonderful music, faint as a will o' the wisp
Crazy as a loon, sad as a gypsy serenading the moon

Oh skylark
I don't know if you can find these things
But my heart is riding on your wings
So if you see them anywhere
Won't you lead me there?
