Lyle Lovett,"She wore glass slippers
She held her head up high
She had that sparkle at her feet
And that twinkle in her eye

She smiled at me
And as I wondered why
She said I'm looking for a cowboy
To take me for a ride

And he can rope me on the prairie
And he can ride me on the plain
And I will be his Cinderella
If he'll be my cowboy man

She said I've got a forty-gallon stetson hat
With a thirty eight-foot brim
We could dance around the outside baby
'Til we both fall in

And you can rope me on the prairie
And you can ride me on the plain
And I will be your Cinderella
If you'll be my cowboy man

Now I ain't never been no cowboy
But heaven knows I try
Cause I'll be riding tall in my saddle
With that Cinderella by my side

And I can rope her on the prairie
And I can ride her on the plain
And she will be me my Cinderella
If I'll be her cowboy man",Cowboy Man,1991
Lyle Lovett,"I know I've seen this place before
Lord can't you hear me screaming
As a young man long ago
When I was twenty-one

And I know I've seen this house before
With people all around it
With my baby cousin on the floor
And Mama in the kitchen

And a woman lies upon the bed
I think she must be dying
And I recall the words she said
As she began to cry

She begged son please don't go to Baltimore
And leave me where I'm lying
For you will son but I no more
Walk among the living

And if you go to Baltimore
Then I'll see you in heaven
And as you breathe I'll breathe no more
And I will surely die

Well you know I went to Baltimore
So confident and wise
And as I breathed she breathed no more
And she did surely die

And now as I lie upon my bed
I pray I must be dreaming
With faces all around my head
And strangers at my door

And a woman's voice calls out to me
Bring unto you your children
And let them see these things you see
And hear the words you say

Beg them to go to Baltimore
And leave you where you're lying
Just like you did one time before
When you were twenty-one

And if they go to Baltimore
Then I'll see you in heaven
And as they breathe you'll breathe no more
And you will surely die

And I know I've seen this place before
Lord can't you hear me screaming
And if I should awaken Lord
Then answer me my plea

What makes the sun set in the west
And birds fly in the sky
And what makes a woman beat her breast
When her children start to cry

And what makes those little ones grow old
To find eternity
And what takes the wise
And leaves behind
A foolish one like me",Baltimore,1992
Lyle Lovett,"When I saw the ambulance screaming down Main Street
I didn't give it a thought
But it was my Uncle Eugene
He died on October
The second, nineteen eighty-one

Now my uncle Wilbert
They all called him Skinner
And they said for his younger ways
He'd get drunk in the morning
And show me the rolls of fifties and hundreds
He kept in the glove box of his old gray Impala

And we're all gonna be here forever
So mama, don't you make such a stir
Just put down that camera
And come on and join up 
The last of the family reserve

Now my second cousin, his name was Calloway
He died when he'd barely turned two
It was peanut butter and jelly that did it
The help, she didn't know what to do
She just stood there and she watched him turn blue

And we're all gonna be here forever
So mama, don't you make such a stir
Just put down that camera
And come on and join up 
The last of the family reserve

And my friend Brian Temple
He thought he could make it
So from the third story he jumped
And he missed the swimming pool only by inches
And everyone said he was drunk

And there was Great Uncle Julius
And there was Aunt Annie Miller
And Mary, and Granddaddy Po
And there was Hannah, and Ella
And Alvin, and Alec
And he owned his own funeral home

And there are more I remember
And more I could mention
And words I could write in a song
But I feel 'em watching
And I see 'em laughing
And I hear 'em singing along

We're all gonna be here forever
So mama, don't you make such a stir
Just put down that camera
And come on and join up 
The last of the family reserve",Family Reserve,1992
Lyle Lovett,"Honey put down that flyswatter
And pour me some ice water
And would you bring me my hammer
And could you find me some nails
For soon I'll be going
To work for this living
And with you here to guide me
Then I cannot fail

The morning it stumbles
Right in through the window
And this getting up early
Gets old anyway
And if you listen close dear
The crying that you hear
Is the nighttime lamenting
The start of the day
 
And it's hotter than concrete
In July in Houston
And it'll get worse here
Before it turns nice
But old Tink's in the backyard
And I swear that boy's so smart
He's got everything ready
So we'll be all right

So honey put down that flyswatter
And pour me some ice water
And though I'll soon be going
Well I haven't gone yet
So come stand here beside me
And hold my hand gently
And tell me do you remember
The first time we met",Flyswatter/Ice Water Blues (Monte Trenckmann's Blues),1992
Lyle Lovett,"She's got big red lips
She's got big brown eyes
When she treats me right
It's a big surprise
She won't do anything
That she said she would
She makes me feel good
She makes me feel good

I ask her ""come here, baby""
She tells me ""no, no""
I ask her ""drive me here""
She tells me ""drive your own""
She likes to race my motor
Then slam my hood
She makes me feel good
She makes me feel good

When the angels look down from above
They see a very special love
How she makes me do what no one could
She makes me feel good
She makes me feel good

So, buddy, if you're feeling down and blue
And your girlfriend treats you bad, too
Man, just remember what she's bound to do
She'll make you feel good
She'll make you feel good

She's got big red lips
She's got big brown eyes
When she treats me right
It's a big surprise
She won't do anything
That she said she would
She makes me feel good
She makes me feel good",She Makes Me Feel Good,1992
Lyle Lovett,"Thank you my friend
I sincerely appreciate the words you say
About how she'll cry
And how she'll grieve and miss me
When she goes away

Say them again
I need to hear the words once more
I can't believe
How she'll miss me when she's gone
And how she'll want to come back home
And never leave

But she's leaving me
Because she really wants to
And she'll be happy when she's gone
She'll be happy
She'll be so very happy
She'll dance and sing
Or even learn to fly
And spend her time with anyone but me

What's that you say
That I'll get over her the more that time goes by
But time goes so slow
When all I have to do is sit around and cry

No she won't be back
I'd be a fool to try to fool myself that way
I know she hasn't one regret
Because she hasn't had one since
The day she came to stay

She's leaving me
Because she really wants to
And she'll be happy when she's gone
She'll be happy
She'll be so very happy
She'll dance and sing
And even learn to fly
And spend her time with anyone but me

She'll be happy when she's gone
She'll be happy when she's gone
She'll be happy when she's gone
She'll be happy when she's gone",She's Leaving Me Because She Really Wants To,1992
Lyle Lovett,"I went to a funeral
Lord it made me happy
Seeing all those people
I ain't seen
Since the last time
Somebody died

Everybody talking
They were telling funny stories
Saying all those things
They ain't said
Since the last time
Somebody died

But you take a look around you
Don't it seem like something's missing
I said something that weren't missing
Lord the last time
Somebody died

You took him from the last time
To that hallowed ground
I'm praying take me to the next time Lord
So I can hang around

Then the people start to looking
And some of them start crying
And all the little children
Lord they're scared
Because they ain't never seen
A dead man before

You took him from the last time
To that hallowed ground
I'm praying take me to the next time Lord
So I can hang around

He's swimming through that Jordan
Going to the other side
But if it's all the same to you Lord
I think I'll stay dry

Now it's church on Sunday
It's a bar on Friday night
It's work on Monday
The preacher Lord you know he might sing

Hallelujah
Sing hallelujah
Sing hallelujah
Sing hallelujah

He's got church on Sunday
And he got drunk the night before
And he got his good gal when he got home
The preacher said he wants some more of that

Hallelujah
Sing hallelujah
Sing hallelujah
Sing hallelujah

Now if you want to get to heaven
Let me tell you what to do
You better grease your foot up buddy
With that mutton stew
And when the devil comes after you
With them greasy hands
You just slide on over to the promised land

Sing hallelujah
Sing hallelujah
Sing hallelujah
Sing hallelujah

Now there was two little imps
And they was black as tar
And they was trying to get to heaven
In an electric car
And that car wheel slipped
On down the hill
Instead of going to heaven
They went to Jacksonville

Sing hallelujah
Sing hallelujah
Sing hallelujah
Sing hallelujah

Thank you, you've been so nice
All my friends they came
Now close the lid down tightly
And quit crying
Because when they close them
They all look the same

And grab hold of the handle
It won't be too heavy
And take me to the graveyard

I went to a funeral
And Lord it made me happy
Seeing all those people
I ain't seen
Since the last time
Somebody",Since the Last Time,1992
Lyle Lovett,"Pass me not, O gentle Savior,
Hear my humble cry;
While on others Thou art calling,
Do not pass me by.
[Chorus:]
(I'm calling)
Savior, Savior,
(Why don't you)
Hear my humble cry;
While on others Thou art calling,
Do not pass me by.
Let me at Thy throne of mercy
Find a sweet relief,
Kneeling there in deep contrition;
Help my unbelief.
[Chorus]
Trusting only in Thy merit,
Would I seek Thy face;
Heal my wounded, broken spirit,
Save me by Thy grace.
[Chorus]
Thou the Spring of all my comfort,
More than life to me,
Whom have I on earth beside Thee?
Whom in heav'n but Thee?",Pass Me Not,1992
Lyle Lovett,"Sometimes it's hard to be a woman
giving all your love to just one man.
You'll have bad times
And he'll have good times, 
Doin' things that you don't understand.
 
But if you love him you'll forgive him,
even though he's hard to understand.
And if you love him Oh be proud of him,
'Cause after all he's just a man.  
 
Stand By Your Man,
Give him two arms to cling to,
And something warm to come to 
when nights are cold and lonely.
 
Stand By Your Man,
And tell the world you love him.
Giving all the love you can.
Stand By Your Man.
 
Stand By Your Man,
And show the world you love him.
Keep giving all the love you can;

And whose kingdom may have just gone home
With another kingdom

So as you can imagine much to my surprise
When the door was flung back open wide
It was a miracle
She walked inside
And pulled her chair up next to me

And that's when she knew
She had made her
First mistake

Honey I don't know what you just heard
But come on baby
Are my favorite words
And where we're going
Is a long way from here

And where we're going
Is a long way from here

So like I said before
I could not have known
How this fairy tale would finally go
Still the only certain thing for sure
Is what I do not know

So like the years and all the seasons pass
And like the sand runs through the hour glass
I just keep on running faster
Chasing the happily
I am ever after

I just keep on running faster
Chasing the happily
I am ever after",Her First Mistake,1996

The steam rises up from the water
And the hotter it is you know the harder it gets

And it ought to be easier
When you turn your lights down low
And it ought to be easier
To leave when you know that you have to go

I know you don't believe me
And I know you don't understand
But honey the way that you treat me
I can't even tell who I am

And you tell me I'm the one you're not to blame
And you tell me I make you feel the same way
And we talk in circles but we never say
It's just out of weakness that both of us stay

And it ought to be easier
When you turn your lights down low
And it ought to be easier
To leave when you know that you have to go

I look at you when you're sleeping
And I think about how it could be
If you would wake up and open your arms
And hold me

But you look at me when you wake up
With eyes that are angry and mean
And I turn away and walk into the kitchen
And I pray for the strength to leave

Because it ought to be easier
When you turn your lights down low
And it ought to be easier

Was two thousand miles away

And play that steel guitar

With his fortune he had made

I said, 'Old pal, I need your help
I hate to be so bold

Down at the swimming hole'

I'd like to have a little loan?

Who really caught my eye

Well, I'd court her on the sly

We'd taken all the nightclubs
And honky tonk around
Join at all the parties
And really do the town

But then one night my wife came home
She must have smelled a rat
She looked around from place to place
And found where I was at

Well, there we were all cuddled up
I knew that I was dead

I jumped right up and said

For some inspiration,
And everything else

Men have lied,
Many good girls have gone astray,
Just to hear the gypsy play
One more lilting cowboy tune,
And as the rivers run dry,
And the mountains blow away,
They sing of lovers and how they lay,
Beneath this crazy frontier moon.

I ain't no golden boy,
I ain't no Grecian dancer,
And I ain't no loudmouthed cowboy
From the West,
I'm not the kind of man
With all the answers,
But I surely know the songs
That suit me best.

But lately I've had something on my mind,
It's growing stronger all the time,
Calling out when I'm alone,
But I'm a poet
And I'm bound to walk the line,
Between the real and the sublime,
And give the muses back their own.

It's a penny for your thoughts,
It's a dollar for your kisses,
Keep a running tab on the time,
'Cause what I've got the most of
Is what she misses,
The clock is hers,
The hourglass is mine.

But I'm her lover,
Not a man bent on revenge,
Hanging out here on the fringe,
Of my native borderlands.

The sun shone golden across her head,
Lying on the banks of the bayou's edge,
Kicking up some Southeast Texas sand.",Ballad of the Snow Leopard and the Tanqueray Cowboy,1998

Couldn't organize love

I let you go and now
I can't forget somehow
I'm lonely in love

I'm young in the daylight
With a pocket full of money
Ladies to the left
And to the right
But when night time comes
I'm a star watcher honey
I can't get along
On light bulb light

So I'm looking at a star
Wondering where you are
Lonely in love
Looking at the sky
Start to wonder my love
How long I'm going to play
In this rained out game
It don't make any sense
But honey be convinced
I'm lonely in love
",Lonely in Love,1998
Lyle Lovett,"The sun went down like a curtain
Memphis looks bigger at night
All the tattooed boys in uniform
Step in and out of the light

She bought me good whiskey in Memphis
She bought supper and she paid for the room
And as best as I can remember
She paid dearly for loving me too

She said hey don't I know you
Ain't you the one
The one with the guitar boys
And all them sad songs
About men in the rain
Did you ever miss a plane
To Memphis

We laughed at the strangers we were in the bed
Two cigarettes lit up the room
Like two backseat lovers, can't wait to get started
Knowing everything's over too soon

Now Memphis ain't bad in the morning
Good coffee well it's just hard to find
But let me suggest that you never leave Memphis
With anything on your mind",Memphis Midnight/Memphis Morning,1998

Mama talked to me last night
She gave to me some good advice
She said, ""Son you ought to quit
This old ramblin' all around
And marry you a sweet loving wife""

But there's more pretty girls than one
More pretty girls than one
Any old town that I ramble all around in
There's more pretty girls than one

So honey look down that old lonesome road
Hang down your pretty head and cry
'Cause I'm thinking all about
Them pretty little gals and hoping that I never die

'Cause there's more pretty girls than one
More pretty girls than one
Any old town that I ramble all around in
There's more pretty girls than one

So honey look down that old lonesome road
Hang down your pretty head and cry

Lyle Lovett,"Last night you know I couldn't sleep
I was tossing, turning, and counting sheep
To tell the truth
The next thing I knew
I woke up on the outside
In the middle of the avenue

A policeman spied me traffic there
In my t-shirt and my underwear
He said, son, son
It sure don't look good
The way you've been calling for your baby
All over the neighborhood

It seems I was sleepwalking
Again last night
The way I was sweet talking
It must have caused a terrible fright
Last night when I was sleepwalking

Someone saw me at a doughnut shop
I was sitting, crying on a tabletop
It was not a pretty sight
I was out of control
The way that I was carrying on
About my sweet jelly roll

I said officer please
My baby's got me down on my knees
Lying in bed
Late at night
Sometimes I just go out of my head
At night
And I go out sleepwalking

Later on down at the jail cell
I was hoping things would turn out well
Because I don't recall
That masquerade ball
And I don't remember nothing y'all
About that blown up rubber doll

So lately I've stopped going anywhere
And I've taken to sleeping with a teddy bear
It's a very full and rich
Imaginary life
And it's sure enough better than dreaming y'all
About any imaginary wife

Lyle Lovett,"That picture hangin' on the wall
Was painted by a friend
He gave it to me all down and out
When he owed me ten
Now it doesn't look like much i guess
But it's all that's left of him
And it sure is nice from right over here
When the light's a little dim

Step inside my house babe
I'll sing for you a song
I'll tell you 'bout where i've been
It shouldn't take too long
I'll show you all the things i own
My treasures you might say
Couldn't be more'n ten dollars worth
But they brighten up my day

Here's a book of poems i got
From a girl i used to know
I guess i read it front to back
Fifty times or so
It's all about the good life
And stayin' at ease with the world
It's funny how i love that book
And i never loved that girl

Hold this piece of glass
Up to the light comin' through the door
It's a prism glass i found on the road
Can you see that little rainbow
Well it's not really a prism i guess
It just broke in a funny way
I found it on my way from texas
Headed for l.a.

This guitar was given me
By old man thomas gray
It's not too much to look at
But i pick it every day
It's been across the country
Four or five times i guess
Between me and old man tom
It never got much rest

Well that's about all i own
And all i care to i guess
Except this pair of boots
And that funny yellow vest
And that leather jacket and leather bag
And hat hangin' on the wall
Just so it's not too much to carry
Could i see you again next fall

Tryin' to teach me a lesson
Thinkin' you'll come back to a better man
If you don't like the way things go
Just stay here and tell me so
'cause there's one thing about me
You've got to understand

I've had enough lonesome
In my education
I don't want to study anymore
About a woman and a slammin' door
If I want to be blue
I've got enough information
I know about lonesome
Teach me about love

Now the words from your sweet lips
And the looks from your sweet eyes
Are lessons that I study day by day
Each day I pick up something new
Each night I learn a thing or two
But how can I learn anything
When teacher's gone away

I've had enough lonesome
In my education
I don't want to study anymore
How to make it through a barroom door
I've been down and out
I'm ready for inspiration
I know about lonesome
Teach me about love

Lyle Lovett,"We crossed the wild pecos
We forded the nueces
We swum the guadalupe
And we followed the brazos
Red river runs rusty
The wichita clear
But down by the brazos
I courted my dear

Singing li, li, li, le, le, le
Lend me your hand
Li, li, li, le, le, le
Lend me your hand
Li, li, li, le, le, le
Lend me your hand
There's many a river
That waters the land

Now the fair angelina
Runs glossy and gliding
The crooked colorado
Runs weaving and winding
The slow san antonio
Courses and plains
But I never will walk
By the brazos again

She kissed me and she hugged me
And she called me her dandy
The trinity's muddy
But the brazos quick sandy
She kissed me and she hugged me
And she called me her own
But down by the brazos
She left me alone

Now the girls of little river
They're plump and they're pretty
The sabine and the sulphur
Hold beauties a'many
The banks of the neches
There are girls by the score
But down by the brazos
I'll wander no more

Is heard in a small Texas town
Like a signal from nowhere the people who live there

'Cause there's bacon to fry and there's biscuits to bake
On the stove that the salvation army won't take
You open the windows and you turn on the fan
'Cause it's hotter than hell when the sun hits the land

Now Walter and fanny well they own the grocery
That sells most all that you need
They've been up and working since early this morning
They've got the whole village to feed

Well they put out fresh eggs, they throw bad ones away
That rotted because of the heat yesterday
The store's all dark so you can't see the flies
That settle on 'round steak and last Monday's pies

And sleepy hill's drugstore and the cafe they're open
The coffee is bubbling hot
And all the folks that ain't working gonna sit there 'til sundown
And talk about what they ain't got

Someone just threw a clutch in the old pickup truck

And his thumb was pointing my way

And I opened my door
I could tell he was a bum
By the muddy boot he wore

Got a woman down in Abilene

He said East Texas
Is where I come from
I was working a rodeo out there
And it sure got humdrum
So I'm just traveling around

I'm mighty glad
You were going my way
In your brand new clothes there
And your great big Chevrolet
I'm going down to Haskell

Well he was grinning like a possum
And a mighty happy rascal
And he waved good-bye
When I let him out in Haskell

All summer long, we sang a song and we strolled on golden sand
Two sweethearts, and the summer wind

Like painted kites, those days and nights they went flyin' by
The world was new, beneath a blue umbrella sky
Then softer than a piper man one day it called to you
I lost you, I lost you to the summer wind

The autumn wind, and the winter wind they have come and gone
Still the days, those lonely days that go on and on
Guess who sighs his lullabies through nights that never end

Lyle Lovett,"I went to church last sunday
So I could sing and pray
But something quite unusual
Happened on that day

Now church it started right on time
Just like it does without a doubt
And everything was all just fine
Except when it came time to let us out

You know the preacher he kept preaching
He told us I have one more thing to say
Children before you think of leaving
You better think about the judgment day

Now everyone got nervous
Because everyone was hungry too
And everyone was wondering
What was the next thing he would do

And the preacher he kept preaching
He said now I'll remind you if I may
You all better pay attention
Or I might decide to preach all day

And now everyone was getting so hungry
That the old ones started feeling ill
And the weak ones started passing out
And the young ones they could not sit still

And the preacher's voice rose higher
So I snuck up on the balcony
And I crept into the choir
And I begged them brothers, sisters, help me please

I said when I give you a signal
I said when I raise up my hand
Won't you please join with me together
And praise the lord I have a plan

And the preacher he kept preaching
Long is the struggle, hard the fight
And I prayed, father please forgive me
And then I stood up and with all my might
I sang

To the lord let praises be
It's time for dinner now let's go eat
We've got some beans and some good cornbread
And I listened to what the preacher said
Now it's to the lord let praised be
It's time for dinner now let's go eat

Yes and I did give a signal
Yes and I raised up my hands
And then joined with me the choir
Yes every woman, child, and man
They sang

To the lord let praised be
It's time for dinner now let's go eat
We've got some beans and some good cornbread
And I've listened to what the preacher said
Now it's to the lord let praised be
It's time for dinner now let's go eat

And the preacher he stopped preaching
And a hush the church did fill
And then a great white dove from up above
Landed on the window sill

And the dove flew down beside him
And a fork appeared right in his hand
And with everybody watching
The preacher ate that bird right there and then

And now everyone got really nervous
And the preacher he did start to glow
And as we watched in disbelief
These were the words he spoke

He said now mama's in the kitchen
And she's been there all day
And I know she's cooking something good
So let's bow our heads and pray
And he sang

To the lord let praises be
It's time for dinner now let's go eat
We've got some beans and some good cornbread
Now listen to what the preacher said
He said to the lord let praised be
It's time for dinner now let's go eat

And the moral of this story
Children it is plain but true
God knows if a preacher preaches long enough
Even he'll get hungry too
And he'll sing

To the lord let praises be
It's time for dinner now let's go eat
We've got some beans and some good cornbread
Now listen to what the preacher said
He said to the lord let praised be
It's time for dinner now let's go eat

Find a sweet relief,
Kneeling there in deep contrition,
Help my unbelief.

""A skinny girl is a misery""
I shook my head because I knew he couldn't be right
But that's when I thought back to just last night

When I got home, it was maybe a little late
There was ne'er a crumb or ne'er a plate
There was no martini, no glass of grape
But it was then I sought to contemplate

Some things, my baby don't tolerate, no
My baby don't tolerate, no
My baby don't tolerate from me

I said, ""Hello honey, how have you been?""
She said, ""What could you possibly
Have been doin' until half past ten?""
And not bein' completely unsensitive
I could tell my ship had run aground
'Cause when I puckered up, you know she puckered down

Some things, my baby don't tolerate, no
My baby don't tolerate, no
My baby don't tolerate from me

Now a small, more ordinary man might not appreciate
Guidance of a good woman who truly loves him
He might drift in despair during the ignorant
Dumbness doings of his dirty daily existence

That's not me, no, yes siree
I'm proof that true love will set you free

He hopes a tire don't blow
Up near Albuquerque
He'll fuel and get some coffee
Cline's Corners truck stop
A waitress with a wet mop
Telling him to don't walk
He tips his hat and don't talk

He knows it's nothing but a good ride
No there's nothing there he can't slide
No there's nothing that he won't spin
No there's nothing to it do it again
No it's nothing but the big show
No there's nowhere that he won't go
No he never has to ask why
He knows it's nothing but a good ride

He says there's something about a sunrise
Waking up sleepy eyed
He says there's something about a highway
Telling him he can't stay
He says there's something about a long drive
That gives him some peace of mind
And there's something that he can't take
When he's coming in second place

He knows it's nothing but a good ride
No there's nothing there he can't slide
No there's nothing that he won't spin
No there's nothing to it do it again
No it's nothing but the big show
No there's nowhere that he won't go
No he never has to ask why
He knows it's nothing but a good ride

And when it's all over
He'll move a little slower
He'll back up to the trailer
And look toward Oklahoma
He'll pull out right through the middle of town
And watch the sun start sinking down
Still just lighting up the road signs
Getting ready for the next time.

He knows it's nothing but a good ride
No there's nothing there he can't slide
No there's nothing that he won't spin

That green and white '58 Fairlane 
It would drive down farm roads past open fields
Seeming like no big deal
As it was happening I never felt a thing

But now looking back it seems like it was everything
Singing with mom just so we could hear ourselves sing
Stealin' a drink from the cold can in daddy's lap
Protected by only a small thin brown paper sack

And the wind blew the echoes of long faded voices
And they'd sing me a song that the old cowboys sang
And I didn't know what the words meant or anything
I was just singing because I was supposed to

As we wander around in this dangerous world
Thank Mother Maria, there's nothing so sweet

And with the windows wide open, it felt hot to us anyway
We three bound together on a day just like any day
They told me and taught me and showed me and bought me
Whatever I wanted from the corner you told them

You said the name Corpus Christi means the body of Jesus
Pronounce it Refugio city folks they don't know
It looks like Palacios but sounds like the lashes
Just listen the next time you watchin', Sid Lasher

Show sure correctness, leaves no room for Santa Claus
Sitting right next to me she looks like that used be

And with the windows wide open, it feels right to us anyway

My mother will start to worry (Hey beautiful, what's your hurry)
And father will be pacing the floor (Listen to that fireplace roar)

I wish I knew how (Your eyes are like starlight now)
To break this spell (I'll take your hat, your hair looks swell)

I oughtta say no, no, no sir (You mind if I move in closer)
At least I'm gonna say that I tried (And what's the sense in hurting my pride)
I really can't stay (Oh baby, don't hold out)
Oh, but it's cold outside

I simply must go (It's cold outside)
The answer is no (Baby, it's cold outside)
The welcome has been (So lucky that you dropped in)
So nice and warm (Look out the window at that storm)

My sister will be suspicious (Your lips look delicious)
My brother will be there at the door (I ain't worried about you brother)
My maiden aunt's mind is vicious (That ol' biddy, she ain't gonna bother me)
Well maybe just a cigarette more (You don't need no cigarette, it's smokin' plenty up in here)

I've got to get home (Baby, you'll freeze out there)
Say, lend me a comb (It's up to your knees out there)
You've really been grand (I thrill when you touch my hand)
Oh, but don't you see (How can you do this thing to me)

There's bound to be talk tomorrow (Well, think of my lifelong sorrow)
At least there will be plenty implied (If you caught pneumonia and died)

Lyle Lovett & His Large Band,"Sometimes it's hard to be a woman
giving all your love to just one man.
You'll have bad times
And he'll have good times, 
Doin' things that you don't understand.
 
But if you love him you'll forgive him,
even though he's hard to understand.
And if you love him Oh be proud of him,
'Cause after all he's just a man.  
 
Stand By Your Man,
Give him two arms to cling to,
And something warm to come to 
when nights are cold and lonely.
 
Stand By Your Man,
And tell the world you love him.
Giving all the love you can.
Stand By Your Man.

And show the world you love him.
Keep giving all the love you can;

You'll have no answers to their questions
And they will have to let you go

And disenfranchised

They'll take away by right what's yours
And make you martyrs of your own cause
When they don't know what cause it's for

And all deserted
Stand alerted
They'll love you when you're all alone
But you find a red rose in the morning light
You wait the night and find it gone

For what I say to you is true

And remembering the falling down

I held my breath and said ""May I have the next one?""

Sparkled on a pug-nosed dream

As we floated over the floor
There were questions but my heart knew all the answers

I felt so blue as the crowds hurried by
Nobody knew how I wanted to cry
Gee but I'd give the world to see
That old gang of mine
I can't forget that old quartette that sang ""Sweet Adeline""
Goodbye forever, old fellows and gals
Goodbye forever, old sweethearts and pals
(God bless them)
Gee but I'd give the world to see
That old gang of mine

Recitation:
Last night 'neath a street lamp I silently stood
On the same corner back in that old neighborhood
As I gazed at the houses, unchanged by the years
In my throat came a lump and my eyes filled with tears
I looked at the lamppost, the pump and the stoop
And again I could picture us kids in a group
There was Shorty, and Yeller and Skinny and Mike
And the rich kid who had ball bearing skates and a bike
And down near the school I could see the brick wall
Where we used to go for a game of handball
And the crabby old janitor who chased us away
Say, what I wouldn't give to just see him today!

And then came the parties and dances-- that's why
We didn't notice the years going by
And the first thing we knew we were all twenty-one
But the Gang stuck together in a fight or in fun
-And then came the War- the crowds in the street
-The blast of the Bugle- the tramp of the feet
And the gang, that old gang of mine
Was the first gang that hit the Von Hindenburg line.

But the war is all over and last night as I stood
On the same corner back in that old neighborhood
I couldn't help brushing a tear from my eye
For I knew not a face in the crowds that went by
Gone forever are the pals that I love
There isn't a trace or a sign
Of that regular honest to goodness old bunch
That I call that old gang of mine",That Old Gang of Mine,2007

Over things you said to me; I couldn't even sleep
You forgot your promises, every single vow
All you did was laugh at me, but things are different now
 
I cried for you; now it's your turn to cry over me
Every road has a turning
That's one thing you're learning
I cried for you; what a fool I used to be
Now I found two eyes just a little bit bluer
I found a heart just a little bit truer
I cried for you; now it's your turn to cry over me
 
How can I forget the hours that I worried through
Wondering the live long day just what next thing to do?
In those days you never thought anything of me
But the slave that was all yours and now at last is free
 
I cried for you; now it's your turn to cry over me
Every road has a turning

Ain't nothing like the real thing.

Ain't nothing like the real thing.

I got your picture hangin' on the wall,
But it can't see or come to me when I call your name.
I realize it's just a picture inside a frame.

I read your letters when you're not near me,
But they don't move me, and they don't groove me
Like when I hear your sweet voice whispering in my ear.
I play the game, a fantasy.
I pretend I'm not in reality.
I need the shelter of your arms to comfort me.

I got some memories to look back on
And though they help me when you're gone,
I'm well aware nothin' can take the place of you being there.
No other sound is quite the same as your name.
No touch can do half as much to make me feel better,

Lyn Larsen,"Some enchanted evening, you may see a stranger,
You may see a stranger across a crowded room,
And somehow you know, you know even then,
That somehow you'll see here again and again.

Some enchanted evening, someone may be laughing,
You may hear her laughing across a crowded room,
And night after night, as strange as it seems,
The sound of her laughter will sing in your dreams.

Who can explain it, who can tell you why?
Fools give you reasons, wise men never try.

Some enchanted evening, when you find your true love,
When you hear her call you across a crowded room,
Then fly to her side and make her your own,
Or all through your life you may dream all alone.

Once you have found her, never let her go,
Once you have found her, never let her go.",Some Enchanted Evening (Reprise),1986
Lyn Murray,"When you walk through a storm
Hold your chin up high
And don't be afraid of the dark.

Walk on, through the rain,
Though your dreams be tossed and blown.

You'll never walk alone.",You'll Never Walk Alone [From Carousel],2010

Song: ""How Deep Is the Ocean?"" Lyrics
How can I tell you what is in my heart?
How can I measure each and every part?
How can I tell you how much I love you?
How can I measure just how much I do?

How much do I love you?
I'll tell you no lie
How deep is the ocean?
How high is the sky?

How many times a day do I think of you?
How many roses are sprinkled with dew?

How far would I travel
To be where you are?
How far is the journey

And if I ever lost you
How much would I cry?

If I had everything I'd still be a slave for you

Lyn Murray Singers,"On the day I was born, 
said my father, said he,
I've an elegant legacy 
waiting for ye.
Tis a rhyme for your lips 
and a song for your heart,
To sing whenever the world falls apart.

Look, look, look to the rainbow.
Follow it over the hill and stream.
Look, look, look to the rainbow.
Follow the fellow who follows a dream.
Follow the fellow, follow the fellow,
Follow the fellow who follows a dream.

'Twas a sumptuous gift bequeathed to a child.
Oh, the lure of that song 
Kept her feet running wild.
For you never grow old and you never stand still
With a whippoorwill singing beyond the next hill.

So, I bundled me heart and I roamed the world free.
To the east with the lark
Tow the west with the sea.
And I searched all the world and I scanned all the skies.
But I found it at last in my own true love's eyes.",Look to the Rainbow,2000

You are too beautiful for one man alone

In a dark and smokey room
A shade of webs that leads you to
A tattered stage that's worn and gray
Another gorl sweats for another day's wage

Oh under a silver moon
She leaves her thoughts behind
Yesterday's long gone cold
The hourglass of time
Lays heavy on her mind

Child, blessed with a smile
Shivers like a snake, the way she moves
Wild, oh so wild
Runnin' from her mind, but she always seems to lose

Under a silver moon, her eyes will never lie
She's on a trip so long
The hourglass of time lays heavy on her mind
And there ain't nothin' you can do

Dance, bitch, dance
'til there's nothing left to hide
Dance, bitch, dance
Your mother should have taught you right
So wipe your tears away

Well my high low mam, don't you give me the blues
Take me to the river where I can let it loose

Where the spirits fly so high
It was a cold dark night, and I swear we was feelin' right
As our bones took us down, straight to the light

I'm goin' down, down, down to the river of love
I'm goin' down, down, down to the river of love

Like an ocean movin', rollin' in on the sand
A sea of love, honey, where you been
My love's been knockin' buy you ain't in

Out back to where the dust grows old
Where the spirits never die

When it lies deep inside you
Cold is the heart with no love
As she sits on the face of the world

Like the daily bump and grind
What's your price
For a chance on the mainline
Checks desires..be last
Silent eyes of a checkered past

Is your love the test of time
Faded days that'll ease your mind
What can you do when you're near the end
Try so hard but you can't pretend

Cold is the heart with no love
When it lies deep inside you
Cold is the heart with no love
As she sits on the face of the world

Strange enchanted love
Icy hand and a velvet glove
What can you hold when your day is done
Count your tears and pray for sun

Cold is the heart with no love
When it lies deep inside you
Cold is the heart with no love
As it sits in the world
Cold is the heart with no love
When it lies deep inside you
Cold is the heart with no love
She just sits on the face of the world.",Cold Is the Heart,1992

I've been tryin'
Tryin' to show to you
The way I feel inside
It don't make no sense
To hide my feelings, no

No time for wastin'
Oh there's got to be a way
I beg, steal or take
The taste of tears
You throw my way

Heaven is waiting
How can you walk away, yeah
(don't walk away)
Don't hurt me, love me, babe
Don't take your time, girl
Don't be late

I've been dyin'
Dyin' to tell you how
You tear me up inside
Just a look from you
Could make or break me

Now, do you remember
Oh when you call my name
I got this...chance
My dreams won't fade away

Heaven is waiting
How can you walk away, yeah

Don't hurt me, love me, babe

Lynda,"Si mes rêves ne se réalisent pas, qu'est-ce que je ferais?
Et si sur mon parcours il n'y a que des échecs, que des prises de tête
Si je n'arrive pas à avancer, que personne ne crois en moi
Dites moi ce que je ferais, ce que je ferais

Plus le temps passe, plus je me sens visée
Par leurs regards, je sais ce qu'ils se disent
Mes pas mine de rien, ne font que s'enliser
Sur un chemin rempli d'épines
Je marche seule car plus personne ne me comprend
Et plus passe le temps, plus on me dit que je deviens différente
Que je change

J'ai peur de blesser ou d'être un jour déçue
Donc je reste solitaire, ma carapace reste ma seule armure
Je suis la même, hé ho, hé ho
Mais personne ne le voit, hé ho, hé ho
Je montre le meilleur de moi, hé ho, hé hooo
Croyez moi

Je suis personne, en même temps grande, je me questionne
Passé, présent, résonnent
Tous ces doutes, ces remords, ces soucis, m'emprisonnent
Je perds le file, j'abandonne
Je n'ai jamais eu l'habitude de m'effondrer
Je garde tout au fond de moi
Je déborde de peine et personne pour essuyer

Pas le temps de rêver, ni même de savourer
Je suis le reflet de leurs sourires
L'avenir veut me couler, et je n'ai pas de bouée
Il n'y a que mon courage pour m'accouder
Je veux simplement grandir dans mes rêves, que mes idées m'emmènent
Que l'on me ressente, et non pas que l'on me craigne

Je n'ai plus envie de faire semblant
Puis de m'effacer de jour en jour
Je n'ai pas envie de porter ce masque, le cœur lourd
Je suis la même, hé ho, hé ho
Mais je me cherche encore, hé ho, hé ho
Je redouble d'effort, hé ho, hé hooo
Me cause du tort

Mon chemin est flou
Oui, mon chemin est trouble
Je prie pour ne pas m'égarer
J'espère que vous ne ferez pas le sourd
Quand je dirais : ""Help, venez m'aider""
Je n'ai besoin de rien, juste d'un peu d'amour
Autour de moi

Je n'ai plus envie de faire semblant

Something in your eyes I see

Too hot to handle
Stars in the night
Blazing their light
Can't hold a candle
To your razzle-dazzle

On a magic carpet ride
Full of butterflies inside
Wanna cry, wanna croon
Wanna laugh like a loon

I'm free as a dove

Deep in your eyes
Blinds me with love",Old Devil Moon,1996

Je ne dirai plus Je vous aime

Je dirai que le vent qui tombe

Lynda Lemay,"Elle ne fait peur à personne
Et pas plus de bruit que son pas
Elle ouvre à tout enfant qui sonne
Mais les journaux n’en parlent pas
Madame Adrienne, c’est une infirmière
Qu’un chagrin d’amour exila très tôt
Ses enfants sont ceux qu’le malheur génère
Et qu’on abandonne dans les hôpitaux
C’qui fait qu’au moment de prendre sa retraite
Madame Adrienne avait sept enfants
Trois petits garçons et quatre fillettes
Qui vivaient chez elle et disaient Maman
Elle ne fait peur à personne
Et pas plus de bruit que son pas
Elle ouvre à tout enfant qui sonne
Mais les journaux n’en parlent pas
Elle avait vingt ans, la belle Adrienne
Quand son amoureux devint son amant
Leur bonheur durait depuis six semaines
Quand elle eut compris qu’elle était maman
L’honneur, en ces temps, voulait qu’on s’exile
Garder le secret et faire semblant
Qu’on avait trouvé du travail en ville
Et qu’on reviendrait pour le jour de l’An
Elle ne fait peur à personne
Et pas plus de bruit que son pas
Elle ouvre à tout enfant qui sonne
Mais les journaux n’en parlent pas
Âgé de trois jours, baptisé Étienne
L’enfant de l’amour était adopté
On persuada la belle Adrienne
Qu’ainsi son secret serait bien gardé
Le sort est cruel pour la fille-mère
Mais avec le temps, les témoins s’en vont
Elle est devenue la belle infirmière
Et n’a retenu qu’à peine un prénom
Elle ne fait peur à personne
Et pas plus de bruit que son pas
Elle ouvre à tout enfant qui sonne
Mais les journaux n’en parlent pas
Il faut vous dire ici que Madame Adrienne
Pour ses quatre-vingts ans, tenait toujours maison
Et faisait son marché et faisait des neuvaines
Rêvant de retrouver, un beau jour, son garçon
Or, un matin d’hiver, l’aînée des quatre filles
Qui vivait avec elle et la suivait partout
La trouva affaiblie et se plaignant beaucoup
Malgré les «Je vais bien» et «Ce n’est pas la peine»
Armande a décidé: «J’appelle un médecin»
Vint donc un homme âgé, au bord de la retraite
Qui remplaçait parfois un confrère occupé
Il s’informe, il ausculte, examine et questionne
Et prescrit du repos… La patiente, à son tour
Se reprend à parler de sa vie d’infirmière
Puis d’un chagrin d’amour et de l’enfant perdu
Et de la barbarie au masque de vertu
Qui bannissait l’enfant, le privant de sa mère
Au nom d’une morale insensible à l’amour
«Je reviendrai vous voir»… Il revient tous les jours
C’est qu’il a soixante ans et qu’il s’appelle Étienne
Il sait que sa maman s’appelait Adrienne
Et qu’il fut adopté… Il sait bien où et quand…
Elle dit souvent, Madame Adrienne
Que les grands bonheurs ont le pas très lent
Elle aura cent ans dans les trois semaines
Et sur son passé, s’est repris vingt ans
Les enfants perdus qu’étaient sa famille
Ont tous des enfants qu’elle gâte un peu
Elle a les joues roses et les yeux qui brillent
Et plein de projets pour chacun d’entre eux
Elle ne fait peur à personne
Et pas plus de bruit que son pas
Elle ouvre à tout enfant qui sonne
Mais les journaux n’en parlent pas
Elle ne fait peur à personne

Sans craindre les conséquences 
Je sais que ce serai mal

Loin des crayons de cire

His eye is on the sparrow, and I know He watches me.

I sing because I'm happy,
I sing because I'm free,
For His eye is on the sparrow,
And I know He watches me.

""Let not your heart be troubled,"" His tender word I hear,
And resting on His goodness, I lose my doubts and fears;
Though by the path He leadeth, but one step I may see;
His eye is on the sparrow, and I know He watches me;
His eye is on the sparrow, and I know He watches me.

I sing because I'm happy,
I sing because I'm free,
For His eye is on the sparrow,
And I know He watches me.

Whenever I am tempted, whenever clouds arise,
When songs give place to sighing, when hope within me dies,
I draw the closer to Him, from care He sets me free;
His eye is on the sparrow, and I know He watches me;
His eye is on the sparrow, and I know He watches me.

I sing because I'm happy,
I sing because I'm free,
For His eye is on the sparrow,
And I know He watches me.",His Eye Is on the SparrowD],2009
Lynda Randle,"So long, I searched for life's meaning
Enslaved by the world and my greed
Then the door of my prison was opened by love
For the ransom was paid
I was free

I'm free from the fear of tomorrow
I'm free from the guilt of my past ooh!
I've traded my shackles for a glorious song
I'm free
Praise the Lord, free at last!

I am free from the guilt that I carried
From the dull empty life, I'm set free
For when I met Jesus he made me complete,
He forgot the foolish child I used to be

I'm free from the fear of tomorrow,
I'm free from the guilt of my past oh
Oh, I traded my shackles for a glorious song
I'm free!

I'll be satisfied as long as I walk let me walk close to Thee
Just a closer walk with Thee grant it Jesus is my plea

Lyndell Marshall,"Walked with no one and talked with no one
And I had nothing but shadows
Then one morning you passed
And I brightened at last
Now I greet the day and complete the day
With the sun in my heart
All my worry blew away
When you taught me how to say

Grab your coat and get your hat
Leave your worry on the doorstep
Just direct your feet
To the sunny side of the street
Can't you hear a pitter-pat?
And that happy tune is your step
Life can be so sweet
On the sunny side of the street

I used to walk in the shade
With those blues on parade
But I'm not afraid
This Rover crossed over

If I never have a cent
I'd be rich as Rockefeller
Gold dust at my feet
On the sunny side of the street
Grab your street",On the Sunny Side of the Street,2002

Time to close your eyes.

The night is on her hair

Nor life I owe nor liberty
With love is lord of all.

And sometimes when the beetle's horn
Hath lulled the eve to sleep
I steal unto her shielding lorn
And through the dooring peep.
There on the cricket's singing stone,
She spares the bogwood fire,
And hums in sad sweet undertones
The song of heart's desire

Lynn,"On the first day on January,
Eighteen ninety-two,
They opened Ellis Island and they let
The people through.
And the first to cross the threshold
Of that isle of hope and tears,
Was Annie Moore from Ireland
Who was all of fifteen years.

[Chorus]
Isle of hope, isle of tears,
Isle of freedom, isle of fears,
But it's not the isle you left behind.
That isle of hunger, isle of pain,
Isle you'll never see again
But the isle of home is always on your mind.

In a little bag she carried
All her past and history,
And her dreams for the future
In the land of liberty.
And courage is the passport
When your old world disappears
But there's no future in the past
When you're fifteen years

[Chorus]

When they closed down Ellis Island
In nineteen forty-three,
Seventeen million people
Had come there for sanctuary.
And in springtime when I came here
And I stepped onto it's piers,
I thought of how it must have been
When you're fifteen years.

That saved a wretch like me
I once was lost, but now am found

And Grace, my fears relieved
How precious did that grace appear
The hour I first believed

Through many dangers, toils and snares
We have already come.
T'was grace that brought us safe thus far
And grace will lead us home,
And grace will lead us home

Lynn,"If you ever go across the sea to Ireland,
Then maybe at the closing of your day,
You can sit and watch the moon rise over Claddagh,
And see the sun go down on Galway Bay.

Just to hear again the ripple of the trout stream,
The women in the meadow making hay,
Just to sit beside the turf fire in a cabin,
And watch the barefoot gosoons as they play.

Ooh

For the breezes blowing o'er the sea's from Ireland,
Are perfumed by the heather as they blow,
And the women in the uplands digging praties,
Speak a language that the strangers do not know.

Yet the strangers came and tried to teach us their ways,
And they scorned us just for being what we are,
But they might as well go chasin' after moon beams,
Or light a penny candle from a star.

And if there's gonna be a life here after,
And faith somehow I'm sure there's gonna be,
I will ask my God to let me make my Heaven,
In that dear land across the Irish sea.

I will ask my God to let me make my Heaven,

Lynn,"Where Lagan stream sings lullaby
There blows a lily fair
The twilight gleam is in her eye
The night is on her hair
And like a love-sick lennan-shee
She has my heart in thrall
Nor life I owe nor liberty
With love is lord of all.

And sometimes when the beetle's horn
Hath lulled the eve to sleep
I steal unto her shielding lorn
And through the dooring peep.
There on the cricket's singing stone,
She spares the bogwood fire,
And hums in sad sweet undertones

Lynn Anderson,"See the tree how big it's grown but friend it hasn't been too long it wasn't big
And I laughed at him and he got mad
The first day that he planted it it was just a twig

Then the first snow came and he ran out to brush the snow away so it wouldn't die
Came runnin' in all excited slipped and almost hurt himself and I laughed till I cried
He was always young at heart kinda dumb and kinda smart and I loved him so
And I surprised him with a puppy kept me up all Christmas Eve two years ago
And it would sure embarrass me

When he'd come in from working late cause he'd always know
If I'd been sittin' there and cryin' over some sad and silly late late show
And honey I miss you and I'm being good and I'd love to be with you if only I could
He wrecked the car and he was sad and so afraid that I'd be mad but what the heck
Though I pretended hard to be

Guess you could say he saw through me and hugged my neck
He came home unexpectedly and caught me crying needlessly in the middle of the day
And it was in the early spring when flowers bloom and robins sing he went away
And honey I miss you and I'm being good and I'd love to be with you if only I could
One day while I was not at home and he was there and all alone the angels came

Now all I have are memories of honey and I wake up nights and call his name
Now my life's an empty stage where honey lived and honey played and love grew up
And a small cloud passes overhead and cries down on the flower bed that honey loved
And see the tree how big it's grown but friend it hasn't been too long it wasn't big
And I laughed at him and he got mad
The first day that he planted it it was just a twig",Honey,1969
Lynn Anderson,"People think it's wonderful our love can be so true
You never say an angry word no matter what I do
And I have so much faith in you I trust you anywhere
But the reason if they only knew is that we just don't care
Just between the two of us let's give up this fantasy
For we no longer care enough to even disagree
Everybody envies us and the way we get along
But just between the two of us we know our love is gone

Wish we could go back again to the days that used to be
We fought a lot but even then I knew you cared for me

For you could see that I would be the perfect fool
Too wrapped around your finger nice and neat
But there would be no end to what I take from you

Mama washed and combed and curled my hair and she painted my eyes and lips
Then I stepped into my satin dancin' dress
That had a split on the side clean up to my hips
It was red velvet trim and it fit me good and starin' back from the lookin' glass
There stood a woman where a half grown kid had stood

She handed me a heart shaped locket that said to thine owenself be true
And I shivered as I watched a rouch crawl across the toe of my high heeled shoe

And it wasn't very long till I knew exactly what my mama'd been talkin' about
I knew what I had to do but I made myself this solemn vow
That I was gonna be a lady someday though I didn't know when or how
I couldn't see spendin' the rest of my life with my head hung down in shame
I might have been born just plain white trash but Fancy was my name
Here's your one chance...
It wasn't long after a benevolent man took me off the street
And one week later I was pourin' his tea in a five room motel suite
I charmed a king a congressman and an occasional aristocrat
Then I got me a Georgia mansion in an elegant New York townhouse flat
And I ain't done bad",Fancy,1970

Not just a girl from the wrong side of town
Good like I used to be he brought it out in me
And that's when I promised that I'd never let him down

Now I'm back here in a barroom a waitress again

Where nobody's right and nobody was wrong

Whenever a new love never turns out like it seems

From love and that's wrong that's so wrong
A happy little home comes up for sale because two fools half tired and failed
To get along and you know that's wrong
A man hurts a woman and a woman hurts a man
And neither one of them won't love and understand
And take it with a grain of salt
But I believe that a little bit of love is better than no love
Even sad love's better than no love even bad love is better than no love at all
A little bit of love is better than no love
Even sad love's better than no love any kind of love is better than no love at all
No love at all is a poor old man standing on the corner with his hat in his hand
And thare's no place to go and he's feeling low
No love at all is a child in the street dodging traffic and a begging to eat
On the tennament row and that's a rough row to hoe
No love at all is a troubled young girl standing on the bridge on the edge of the world
And it's a mnighty short fall
But I believe that a little bit of love...

Along with the sunshine

I could promise you things like big diamond rings
But you don't find roses growin' on stalks of clover

I'd just as soon let you go

You better look before you leap, still waters run deep
And there won't always be someone there to pull you out

Watch them trains roll out of sight

Wish to God that I could be

As I step down from the train
And there to meet me is my mama and papa

And down the road I look and there runs Mary
Hair of gold and lips like cherries
It's good to touch the green green grass of home

Yes, they've all come to meet me
Arms areached smiling sweetly
It's so good to touch the green green grass of home

The old house is still standing
Though the paint is cracked and dry
And there's that old oak tree that I used to play on

Down the lane I'd walk with my sweet Mary
Hair of gold and lips like cherries
It's good to touch the green green grass of home

Then I awake and look around me
At these four gray walls that surround me
And I realized that I was only dreaming

For there's a guard and there's a sad old padre
Arm in arm, we'll walk at daybreak
And again I'll touch the green green grass of home

They'll all come to see me
In the shade of that old oak tree
As they lay me 'neath the green green grass of home

And I watched our little girl outside at play,
With the little boy next door like so many times before
But something didn't seem quite right today

So I went outside to see what they were doing
And then the teardrops made my eyes go dim,
Cause I heard him name a game, and I hung my head in shame
When I heard our little girl say to him:

I don't want to play house
I know it can't be fun
I've watched Mommy and Daddy
And if that's the way it's done

My Daddy said ""Goodbye""

My heart would keep reminding me I still belong to you
Many times I've had the urge to pack my things and leave
But this feeling comes and goes so I'll never do
If I love you enough to stand the things you've put tme through
No matter what you'd do to me I still belong to you

Lynn Anderson,"Well I woke up Sunday morning
With no way to hold my head
That didn't hurt
And the beer I had for breakfast wasn't
Bad so I had one more for dessert

Then I fumbled through my closet
For my clothes
And found my cleanest dirty shirt
And I shaved my face
And combed my hair
And stumbled down the stairs
To meet the day

I'd smoked my brain the night before
With cigarettes and songs
That I've been pickin'
But I lit my first and watched a small kid
Cussin' at a can that he was kickin

Then I crossed the empty street and
Caught the sunday smell
Of someone fryin chicken
And it took me back to something
That I'd lost somehow
Somewhere along the way

On the sunday morning sidewalk
Wishing lord that I was stoned
Cause there's something in a sunday
That makes a body feel alone
And there's nothing short of dying
Half as lonesome as the sound
On the sleeping city sidewalk
Sunday morning coming down

In the park I saw a daddy
With a laughing little girl
He was swingin
And I stopped beside the Sunday school
And listened to the song
That they were singing

Then I headed back for home
And somewhere far away
A lonely bell was ringing
And it echoed thru the canyon like
The disappearing dreams of yesterday

On the sunday morning sidewalk
Wishing lord that I was stoned
Cause therels something in a sunday
That makes a body feel alone
And there's nothing short of dying
Half as lonesome as the sound
On the sleeping city sidewalk

Clouds of doubt were gone at last I saw the sunshine
Instead of crying now I feel like singing all the time
Yes at last I know how sweet the joys of love can be
And it all happened when your sweet love lifted me

Who told you that lie?
Whoever told you

I'd get hurt and the tear would well up in my eye
Then she hold me and tell me that big girls don't cry

I fell for his kisses and he promised me a ring

Lynn Anderson,"There was a boy in Arkansas who wouldn't listen to his ma
When she told him that he should go to school
He'd sneak away in the afternoon take a little walk and pretty soon
You'd find him at the local auction barn
Well he'd stand and listened carefully then pretty soon he began to see
How the auctioneer could talk so rapidly
He said oh my it's do or die I've got to learn that auction cry
Gotta make my mark and be an auctioneer
A 15 dollar bid and now twenty now
Will you gimme twenty make it now twenty bi di di bom a twenty now
Will you gimme twenty who da ba bi bi da twenty dollar bid
I got twenty dollar bid and now twenty five now
Will you gimme twenty five make it now twenty five bi di di bom a twenty five now
Will you gimme twenty five who da ba bi bi da twenty five dollar bid
Well as time went on he did his best and all could see he didn't jest
He practiced calling bids both night and day
His pop would find him behind the barn just working up an awful storm
As he tried to imitate an auctioneer
His dad said son we just can't stand to have a mediocre man
Sellin' things at action using our name
We'll send you off to auction school and then you'll be nobody's fool
You can take your place among the best
A twenty five dollar bid and now thirty now
Will you gimme thirty make it now thirty bi di di bom a thirty now
Will you gimme thirty who da ba bi bi da thirty dollar bid
A thirty dollar bid and now thirty five now
Will you gimme thirty five make it now thirty five bi di di bom a thirty five now
Will you gimme thirty five who da ba bi bi da thirty five dollar bid
So from that boy who went to school there grew a man who played it cool
He came back home a full fledged auctioneer
And the the people came from miles around just to hear him make that rhytmic sound
That fill their hearts with such a happy cheer
His fame spread out from shore to shore but he had all he could do and more
Had to buy a plane to get around
Now he's the best in all the land let's pause to give that man a hand
He's the best of naughty auctioneers
I got thirty five dollar bid and now forty dollar forty
Will you gimme forty make it forty bi di di bom a forty dollar

Was because there always was a man to blame
It was't God who made...

Midnight, and I'm a-waiting on the twelve-oh-five Hoping it'll take me just a little farther down the line Moonlight, you're just a heartache in disguise; Won't you keep my heart from breaking if it's only for a very short time CHORUS: Playing with the queen of hearts, knowing it ain't really smart The joker ain't the only fool who'll do anything for you Laying out another lie, thinking 'bout a life of crime That's what I'll have to do to keep me away from you Honey, you know it makes you mad Why is everybody telling everybody what you have done Baby, I know it makes you sad But when they're handing out the heartaches you know you got to have you some CHORUS: Lovers, I know you've had a few But hide your heart beneath the covers and tell 'em they're the only one And others, they know just what I'm going through And it's a-hard to be a lover when you say you're only in it for fun Playing with the queen of hearts, knowing it ain't really smart The joker ain't the only fool who'll do anything for you CHORUS Playing with the queen of hearts (repeat and fade)

Even though we ain't got money I'm so in love with you honey
Everything will bring a chain of love
In the mornin' when I rise you bring a tear of joy to my eyes
Tell me everything is gonna be all right

Love the man who holds the world in a paper cup oh drink it up
Love him and he'll bring you luck
And if you find he helps your mind better take him home
Oh don't you live alone try to earn what lovers own
Even though we ain't got money...

And the reason it's clear is because you are here

Is the love that I found ever since you've been around?
Your love's put me at the top of the world
Something in the way you slur my name
And it's telling me that things are not the same

There is only one wish on my mind

That tomorrow will be just the same for you and me

Midnight, and I'm a-waiting on the twelve-oh-five Hoping it'll take me just a little farther down the line Moonlight, you're just a heartache in disguise; Won't you keep my heart from breaking if it's only for a very short time CHORUS: Playing with the queen of hearts, knowing it ain't really smart The joker ain't the only fool who'll do anything for you Laying out another lie, thinking 'bout a life of crime That's what I'll have to do to keep me away from you Honey, you know it makes you mad Why is everybody telling everybody what you have done Baby, I know it makes you sad But when they're handing out the heartaches you know you got to have you some CHORUS: Lovers, I know you've had a few But hide your heart beneath the covers and tell 'em they're the only one And others, they know just what I'm going through And it's a-hard to be a lover when you say you're only in it for fun Playing with the queen of hearts, knowing it ain't really smart The joker ain't the only fool who'll do anything for you CHORUS Playing with the queen of hearts (repeat and fade)

When I jokingly said come and be my bride
Now that time has turned the pages it's the sweetest joke on earth
That I have you near forever by my side

Maybe someday you're gonna hurt me I've been hurting of before

Straingers ain't come down from Rocky Top I reckon they never will
Corn won't grow at all on Rocky Top the dirt's too rocky by far
That's why all the folks on Rocky Top get their corn from a jar

I'm only human baby
Ain't I allowed to make mistakes

And it's causing my poor heart to break, yeah
Making me the human that I am

Lynn Carey Saylor,"Many times I tried to tell you
Many times I cried alone
Always I'm surprised how well you cut my feelings to the bone
Don't want to leave you really
I've invested too much time to give you up that easy
To the doubts that complicate your mind
 
We belong to the light, we belong to the thunder
We belong to the sound of the words we've both fallen under
Whatever we deny or embrace for worse or for better
We belong, we belong, we belong together
 
Maybe it's a sign of weakness when I don't know what to say
Maybe I just wouldn't know what to do with my strength anyway
Have we become a habit?  Do we distort the facts?
Now there's no looking forward
Now there's no turning back
When you say
 
We belong to the light, we belong to the thunder
We belong to the sound of the words we've both fallen under
Whatever we deny or embrace for worse or for better
We belong, we belong, we belong together
 
Close your eyes and try to sleep now
Close your eyes and try to dream
Clear your mind and do your best to try and wash the palette clean
We can't begin to know it, how much we really care
I hear your voice inside me, I see your face everywhere
Still you say
 
We belong to the light, we belong to the thunder
We belong to the sound of the words we've both fallen under
Whatever we deny or embrace for worse or for better
We belong, we belong, we belong together

And I must admit I like it quite well.
It's something to be the darling of all;
Le grande femme fatale, the belle of the ball,
There's nothing as gay as life in Paris ,
There's no other person, I'd rather be,
I love what I do, I  love what I see,
But where is the schoolgirl that used to be me.

Ah, the apple trees,
Where at garden teas,
Jack-o-lanterns swung:
Fashions of the day,
Vests of applique,
Dresses of shantung,
Only yesterday.
When the world was young

While sitting around we often recall,
The laugh of the year, the night of them all,
The blonds who was so attractive that year,
Some opening night that made us all cheer;
Remember that time we all got so tight,
And Jacques and Antoine got into a fight,
The gendarmes who came, passed out like a light,
I laugh with the rest, it's all very bright.

Ah, the apple trees,
Sunlight memories,
Where the hammock swung,
On our backs we'd lie;
Looking at the shy,
Till the stars were strung,
Only last July,
When the world was young.

You'll see me in Cape D'Antibes , or in Spain,
I follow the sun by boat or by plane,
It's any old millionaire in a storm,
For I've got my mink to keep my heart warm:
And sometimes I drink too much with the crowd,
And, sometimes I talk a little too loud,
My head may be aching, but it's unbowed,
And sometimes I see it all through the cloud

And the hive of bees,

Where people from cities, they drove down admiring
The mountains and rivers they always imagined
To never have substance at all

Of a great British empire living in glory
I sat down beside him and listened intently
But couldn't find meaning at all

On the road, always without a prayer
On the road, the road to nowhere

Of high-flying critics who scorn at the millions
Of ordinary people who live in the shadows
And search for a light in the dark

I'm traveling this road and I'm playing in places
To handfuls of people with hope in their faces
They're asking me questions and searching for meanings
In songs I can't give them at all

On the road, always without a prayer
On the road to nowhere

I sometimes imagine there's nobody listening
To the songs that I'm singing at all

I'm sitting here singing this song by the river
Looking at towers and grey concrete buildings
I'm dreaming of Ireland and wet summer evenings
And wishing I was back home again

Lynn Hope,"I need your love so badly, I love you, oh, so madly
But I don't stand a ghost of a chance with you!

And ""I don't stand a ghost of a chance with you!""

Lynn Hope,"I want to take you to a little room
A little room where all the roses bloom
I want to lead you into Nature's hall
Where ev'ry year the roses give a ball
They have an orchestra up in the trees
For their musicians are the birds and bees
And they will sing us a song
As we are strolling along
 
In sunny Roseland, where summer breezes are playing
Where the honey bees are ""A-Maying""
There all the roses are swaying
Dancing while the meadow brook flows
The moon when shining is more than ever designing
For 'tis ever then I am pining
Pining to be sweetly reclining
Somewhere in Roseland
Beside a beautiful rose
 
The ball is over and tulips meet
Their little kisses are so short and sweet
The lilies nod to the forget-me-nots
When they're departing in their flower pots
But all the roses with their spirits high
Remain to love until they droop and die
And dear, why shouldn't it be
Just so with you and with me
 
In sunny Roseland, where summer breezes are playing
Where the honey bees are ""A-Maying""
There all the roses are swaying
Dancing while the meadow brook flows

Lynn Hope,"And now the purple dusk of twilight time
Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb
Always reminding me that we're apart
You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms
The nightingale 
Tells his fairytale
Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain
My stardust melody
The memory of love's refrain.",Stardust,1999
Lynn Hope,"Blue moon you saw me standing alone
Without a dream in my heart
Without a love of my own
Blue moon, you knew just what I was there for
You heard me saying a prayer for 
Someone I really could care for
And then there suddenly appeared before me
The only one my arms will ever hold
I heard somebody whisper ""Please adore me""
And when I looked, the moon had turned to gold!

Years full of tears and regret;
I've been alone broken hearted,
Trying so hard to forget:
 
Girl of my dreams I love you, honest I do,
You are so sweet,
If I could just hold your charms again in my arms,
Then life would be complete;
Since you've been gone dear, life don't seem the same,
Please come back again.
And after all's said and done, there's only one,
Girl of my dreams, it's you.
 
It's strange how life deals you sorrow,
Sunshine and joy always nigh;
We live and learn for tomorrow,
But sometimes the learning comes high:

Lynn Hope,"Once she dressed in silks and lace, Owned a Rolls Royce car
Now she seems quite out of place, like a fallen star
Draped around my kitchen sink , Happy as can be
I just have to stop and think, Why she fell for me.

I'm not much to look at, nothing to see
Just glad I'm livin' and lucky to be
I got a woman crazy for me
She's funny that way.

I can't save a dollar, ain't worth a cent
She doesn't holler she'd live in a tent
I got a woman crazy for me
She's funny that way.

Tho' she loves to work and slave for me ev'ry day
She'd be so much better off if I went away.

But why should I leave her, why should I go
She'd be unhappy without me I know
I got a woman crazy for me
She's funny that way.

She should have the very best, Anyone can see
Still she's diff'rent from the rest, satisfied with me.
While I worry plan and scheme, Over what to do
Can't help feeling it's a dream, Too good to be true. 

Never had nothin'; no one to care
That's why I seem to have more than my share,
I got a woman, crazy for me,
She's funny that way.

When I hurt her feelings, once in a while,
Her only answer is one little smile,
I got a woman crazy for me.
She's funny that way.

I can see no other way and no better plan,
End it all and let her go to some better man;
But I'm only human, coward at best
I'm more than certain she'd follow me west,
I got a woman crazy for me,

Didn't whisper sweet nothings. Never told me I'm pretty.
You sure weren't perfect. What's perfect these days?
But you left me now I'm destroyed.

You cheated at cards, and lied when you hung out
In bars making time with those girls you called old pals
I cried when you left me,
Now I'm wondering when you'll make it all up to me?

Don't I have the right to be over you yet?
I've tried pretending. I tried to forget.
Though it's past three AM I would still let you in
'Cause I can't go on dreaming alone.

I work at my desk and stare at the letter
And think of the first one that you never answered.
Pour milk in my coffee and watch it explode
And know that you're doing the same.

Don't I have the right to be over this fling?
You once said you loved me- we talked about rings.
I would try someone new if that someone would love me the way you did.

Lynn Kellogg,"We starve, look at one another short of breath
Walking proudly in our winter coats
Wearing smells from laboratories
Facing a dying nation of moving paper fantasy
Listening for the new told lies
With supreme visions of lonely tunes
Somewhere, inside something , there is a rush of greatness
Who knows what stands in front of our lives
I fashion my future on films in space
Silence tells me secretly ev'rything, ev'rything
Singing my space songs on a spiderweb star
""Life is around you and in you""

We could have taken any town
We could have danced along the bars
We could have burned the whole place down

And this love poured down like rain
And we lived out on the line
And we spun like hurricanes

And I was yours and you were mine
And I was yours and you were mine",I Know It Was Love,1996
Lynn Miles,"I loved a cowboy
I loved his cowboy ways
I loved his sky-blue eyes
Those cold November days
He'd walk across the field
And I could see his breath
And I swear I heard his heart
Beating inside his chest

And those nights spent in two-horse towns
Pick-up trucks and country bars
Those nights were like blankets
Like movies
Like falling . . . like falling . . . stars 

Well I loved this cowboy
More than I should admit
More than I knew was right
But I got real used to it
I would go out ridin'
For two weeks at a time
And I knew the only lonely heart
Was never his, only mine 

And those nights spent in two-horse towns
Pick-up trucks and country bars
Those nights were like blankets
Like movies
Like falling . . . like falling . . . stars 

When I thought about it
Some loves are compromise
Some loves burn bright and fast and die
Some loves are all on one side
So I left this cowboy
I left on New Year's Day
It was my resolution
I just up and rode away

From those nights spent in two-horse towns
Pick-up trucks and country bars
Those nights were like blankets
Like movies

Then I watched the neighbors' kids try to lick the flakes
All the passing cars stopped to check their brakes
And pretty soon we'll be singing Christmas songs
Like ""I wish I had a river that I could skate away on""

And then I watched the rooftops change from black to white
All the cats and dogs went home for the night
And the birds left town 'bout a month ago
Except for the ones that are built for snow

And then I watched the trees shiver by the light of the moon

About the cold and the snow and I'll complain until spring

Lynn Miles,"Loneliness is an envelope you can seal yourself into 
And send off to a stranger in a )town across the sea
Loneliness is a tired old friend who carries your baggage 
Through airports and train stations for free
Loneliness wears a suit and tie on busy city streets
And makes you cry at parties filled with people that you know
Loneliness will take your hand and lead you to the shoreline 
On foggy days to find the undertow

It is the hurt that hurts the deepest
It is the ache that you can't cure
It is the desperation of the late night telephone call
It is the lover in the shadows
It is the one that got away
It is the cry of the southbound birds in the fall 

Loneliness will steal your soul on stormy windy hills
And hides behind red maple trees on autumn afternoons
Loneliness sits on the porch of the house you used to live in
It is the distant sound of thunder and trains and loons

It is the hurt that hurts the deepest
It is the ache that you can't cure

Across the mountains far, but when it came to rest
They scarce believed their eyes, they'd come so many miles

And nothing but a child could help erase these miles

Was I to walk the floor and worry over endless days to come
Or cry and plead down on my knees for you?
I couldn't stand to be alone, you left me nothing else to choose
So I found someone to take your place, what was I suppose to do?

Lynn Morris Band,"You were my hearts desire you set the flame of love on fire
No other love cold take the place of you
Then you left me all alone so lonesome and so blue
And I found someone to take your place what was I suppose to do

   Was I to walk the floor and worry over endless days to come
   Or cry and plead down on my knees for you
   I couldn't stand to be alone you left me nothing else to choose
   So I found someone to take your place what was I suppose to do

I know I vowed there'd never be no other love
The dream that I'd been searching for was you
But then that dream came to an end there was no use to pretend
So I found someone to take your place what was I suppose to do

 
",What Was I Supposed to Do?,1990
Lynn Morris Band,"We have been so close together
Each a candle each a flame
All the dangers were outside us
And we knew them all by name

   See how the bramble and the rose
   Intertwine
   Love grows like the bramble and the rose
   Round each other we will twine

Now I've hurt you and it hurts me 
Just to see what we can do
To ourselves and to each other 
Without really meaning to

So put your arms around me
And we'll sing a true love song
And we'll learn to sing together
Sing and laugh the whole night long

",The Bramble and the Rose,1992
Lynn Morris Band,"As you go from me you want all that's left
The last thread of pride in my heart
'Til you've wrung the last teardrop from my eye
You won't be satisfied.

   So take your cold unloving heart
   Your eyes too blinded to see
   You've never found the door to this heart of mine
   You'll get no more of me.

You wrecked my heart like a cruel winter storm
Bending my branches so low
Oh your wayward heart and your tortured soul
Leave no memory worthy to hold.

So I'll take back my heart from the willow bough
I'll hang my tears out to dry
I'll hang my head in sorrow no more
And no more tears will I cry.

",You'll Get No More of Me,1993
Lynn Morris Band,"There stands a rose in your garden
You left it there all alone
It's been neglected, feels unwanted
Since no love to it is shown. 
Its beauty now is fastly fading
Once it was the brightest red
It's withering fast, its head is bowing
Since no kind words to it are said. 

Don't neglect the rose in your garden
Show it your love every day
It will bloom for you in all its beauty
And it will not fade away

I guess by now you know my story
Don't neglect a love that's true
For it may prove to be the sweetest flower
That will ever bloom for you. 

Could be your mother, sister or brother
Husband, wife or a little child
It may prove to be your own true lover
You've neglected all the while. 

Please don't neglect the rose in your garden
Show it your love every day
And it will bloom for you in all its beauty
And it will not fade away
And it will not fade away 
",Don't Neglect the Rose,2003

You came right on time
You soon had me believin'

But, baby, heaven was just a stop along the way

There's a long train rollin'
And a blue moon above
You switched me back, I jumped the track

If I had everything I'd still be a slave for you

Stars and moon so bright
Still I'd turn for life to you

Lynn Murray,"On the day I was born, 
said my father, said he,
I've an elegant legacy 
waiting for ye.
Tis a rhyme for your lips 
and a song for your heart,
To sing whenever the world falls apart.

Look, look, look to the rainbow.
Follow it over the hill and stream.
Look, look, look to the rainbow.
Follow the fellow who follows a dream.
Follow the fellow, follow the fellow,
Follow the fellow who follows a dream.

'Twas a sumptuous gift bequeathed to a child.
Oh, the lure of that song 
Kept her feet running wild.
For you never grow old and you never stand still
With a whippoorwill singing beyond the next hill.

So, I bundled me heart and I roamed the world free.
To the east with the lark
Tow the west with the sea.
And I searched all the world and I scanned all the skies.
But I found it at last in my own true love's eyes.",Look to the Rainbow,2000

Hold your chin up high

Walk on, through the rain,
Though your dreams be tossed and blown.

And you'll never walk alone,

There was three children from the land of Israel
Shadrack, Meshach, Abednego
They took a little trip to the land of Babylon
Shadrack, Meshach, Abednego
Nebudchanezzer was the king of Babylon
Shadrack, Meshach, Abednego
He took a lot of gold, and made an idol
Shadrack, Meshach, Abednego

And he told everybody ""when you hear the music of the trombone""
And he told everybody ""when you hear the music of the clarinet""
And he told everybody ""when you hear the music of the horn
You must fall down and worship the idol""
Shadrack, Meshach, Abednego

But the children of Israel would not bow down
Shadrack, Meshach, Abednego
Couldn't fool 'em with a golden idol
Shadrack, Meshach, Abednego
I said, you couldn't fool 'em with a golden idol
Shadrack, Meshach, Abednego

So the king put the children in the fiery furnace
Shadrack, Meshach, Abednego
Heaped on coals and red-hot brimstone
Shadrack, Meshach, Abednego
Eleven times hotter, hotter than it ought to be
Shadrack, Meshach, Abednego
Burned up the soldiers that the king had put there
Shadrack, Meshach, Abednego

But the Lord sent an angel with the snow-white wings
Down in the middle of the furnace
Talkin' to the children 'bout the power of the Gospel
Shadrack, Meshach, Abednego

Well, they couldn't burn a hair on the head of
Shadrack, Meshach, Abednego
Laughin' and talkin' while the fire jumpin' 'round
Shadrack, Meshach, Abednego

Old Nebudchanezzer called, ""hey there!""
When he saw the power of the Lord
And they had a regal time in the house of Babylon

Over things you said to me; I couldn't even sleep
You forgot your promises, every single vow
All you did was laugh at me, but things are different now
 
I cried for you; now it's your turn to cry over me
Every road has a turning
That's one thing you're learning

I found a heart just a little bit truer

Wondering the live long day just what next thing to do?

They have an orchestra up in the trees

And they will sing us a song
As we are strolling along
 
In sunny Roseland, where summer breezes are playing
Where the honey bees are ""A-Maying""
There all the roses are swaying
Dancing while the meadow brook flows
The moon when shining is more than ever designing
For 'tis ever then I am pining
Pining to be sweetly reclining
Somewhere in Roseland
Beside a beautiful rose
 
The ball is over and tulips meet
Their little kisses are so short and sweet
The lilies nod to the forget-me-nots
When they're departing in their flower pots
But all the roses with their spirits high
Remain to love until they droop and die
And dear, why shouldn't it be

Lynne Jackson,"Beautiful miracle, pardon my lyrical rhapsody,
But can't you see, you've captured me.
Being so glamorous, can't you be amorous just with me?
Make it soon, take a look at the moon.

Love is just around the corner, any cozy little corner.
Love is just around the corner when I'm around you.
I'm a sentimental mourner, and I couldn't be forlorner,
When you keep me in a corner just waiting for you.
Venus de Milo was noted for her charms,
But strictly between us, you're cuter than Venus,
And what's more you got arms.
So cuddle in a corner, any cozy corner,
Love is just around the corner and I'm around you.",Love Is Just Around the Corner,1998
Lynne Jackson,"It was Montmartre 
It was midnight Come to think of it
It was spring
There was music I was listening
Then in the room somewhere someone began to sing 
This serenade made for remembering
 
A small cafe, Mam'selle
Our rendezvous, Mam'selle
The violins were warm and sweet 
And so were you, Mam'selle
And as the night danced by 
A kiss became a sigh
Your lovely eyes seemed to sparkle 
Just like wine does
No heart ever yearned the way mine does for you
And yet I know too well 
Some day you'll say goodbye 
Then violins will cry 
And so will I, Mam'selle

Lynne Jackson,"""Clang, clang, clang"" went the trolley
""Ding, ding, ding"" went the bell
""Zing, zing, zing"" went my heartstrings
For the moment I saw him I fell
 
""Chug, chug, chug"" went the motor
""Bump, bump, bump"" went the brake
""Thump, thump, thump"" went my heartstrings
When he smiled, I could feel the car shake

He tipped his hat, and took a seat
He said he hoped he hadn't stepped upon my feet
He asked my name I held my breath
I couldn't speak because he scared me half to death

""Buzz, buzz, buzz"" went the buzzer
""Plop, plop, plop"" went the wheels
""Stop, stop, stop"" went my heartstrings
As he started to leave I took hold of his sleeve with my hand

And as if it were planned
He stayed on with me and it was grand
Just to stand with his hand holding mine
All the way to the end of the line",The Trolley Song,1998
Lynne Jackson,"Embrace me, my sweet embraceable you!
Embrace me, you irreplaceable you!

Just one look at you
My heart grew tipsy in me,
You and you alone
Bring out the gypsy in me! 

I love all, the many charms about you!
Above all, I want my arms about you! 

Don't be a naughty baby,
Come to papa, come to papa, do!
My sweet embraceable you!",Embraceable You,1999
Lynne Jackson,"It's very clear, our love is here to stay
Not for a year but ever and a day
The radio and the telephone and the movies that we know
May just be passing fancies and in time may go

But oh, my dear, our love is here to stay
Together we're going a long, long way
In time the Rockies may crumble, Gibraltar may tumble
They're only made of clay
But our love is here to stay

Lynne Jackson,"The man who only lives for making money
Lives a life that isn't necessarily sunny
Likewise the man who works for fame

There's no guarantee that time won't erase his name
The fact is, the only work that really brings enjoyment
Is the kind that is for girl and boy meant
Fall in love and you won't regret it
That's the best work of all, if you can get it
Holding hands at midnight

'Neath a starry sky
Nice work if you can get it
And you can get it if you try
Strolling with the one girl
Sighing sigh after sigh
Nice work if you can get it
And you can get it if you try

Just imagine someone
Waiting at the cottage door
Where two hearts become one
Who could ask for anything more?
Loving one who loves you
And then taking that vow
It's nice work if you can get it
And if you get it, won't you tell me how?""

Lynne Rothrock,"There's a saying old says that love is blind
Still were often told, seek and ye shall find
So I'm going to seek a certain lad I've had in mind
Looking everywhere, haven't found him yet

Hes the big affair I cannot forget
Only man I ever think of with regret
I'd like to add his initial to my monogram
Tell me, where is the shepherd for this lost lamb?

There's a somebody I'm longing to see
I hope that he turns out to be
Someone who'll watch over me
I'm a little lamb who's lost in the wood
I know I could always be good
Someone who'll watch over me

Although he may not be the man some
Girls think of as handsome
To my heart he carries the key
Won't you tell him please to put on some speed
Follow my lead, oh, how I need
Someone to watch over me",Someone to Watch Over Me,2002
Lynne Sherman,"You took my kisses and all my love
You taught me how to care
Am I to be just remnant of a one side love affair

All you took
I gladly gave
There is nothing left for me to save

All of me
Why not take all of me
Can't you see
I'm no good without you
Take my lips
I want to lose them
Take my arms
I'll never use them
Your goodbye left me with eyes that cry
How can I go on dear without you
You took the part that once was my heart
So why not take all of me",All of Me,1996
Lynne Wintersteller,"I'm as restless as a willow in a windstorm
I'm as jumpy as a puppet on a string
I'd say that I had spring fever
But I know it isn't spring

I am starry-eyed and vaguely discontented
Like a nightingale without a song to sing
Oh, why should I have Spring fever
When it isn't even spring?

I keep wishing I were somewhere else
Walking down a strange new street
Hearing words that I have never heard
From a girl I've yet to meet

I'm as busy as a spider spinning daydreams
I'm as giddy as a baby on a swing
I haven't seen a crocus or a rosebud or a robin on the wing
But I feel so gay in a melancholy way
That it might as well be spring

It might as well be spring",It Might as Well Be Spring,1994
Lynns,"Well I beg your pardon girl
But I think it's time we had a talk
You know exactly who I am
And what I want
You seem to be a bit confused about what's your's and what's mine
So I came in here tonight to show you the light

Woman to woman
Face to face
Oh, I got no intentions of letting my man slip away
Woman to woman

It's no secret around this town about the games you like to play
And that band of gold on his hand to you, it don't mean one thing
It's not that I don't trust him, 'cause honey, I know right where his heart is
And as tempting as you may be, it's me he's in love with

Lynns,"It started out
With just a glance
Some conversation, slow dance
It was nothing
It didn't mean too much
But all of a sudden he's on your mind
You think about him all the time
Welcome girl, to the crazy world of love

[Chorus]
Your heart's doing somersaults
Head spinning like a top with thoughts of only him
You pace up and down the hall waiting for his phone call
Can't wait to your baby again
Go ahead
Try to deny it
But your dreamin' from cloud nine
Welcome girl, to the crazy world of love

Don't get too close, put up your guard
You might wind up with a broken heart
That's something you've had your share of

You can't believe your falling

Lynns,"You did not understand what goodbye could do
You seem a little dazed and confused
Oh, but you've been blind to the writing on the wall
Well hello honey face it, reality as come to call

[Chorus]
You're gonna cry, cry baby
Those tears will fall like rain
When the shoe's on the other foot those teardrops ain't the same
You're gonna get a little close up of what I've been feeling lately
But all I can tell you, is cry cry baby

Now there ain't no way to take this like a man
So you best prepare yourself the best you can
While your out there drowning in a sea of pain
There's just one thing for certain
And that cold hard fact remains

[Chorus: x2]

All I can tell you, is cry cry baby",Cry Cry Baby,1998
Lynns,"All I have to do
Is look at you
And I know why
A woman loves a man
All I have to do
Is stare into your eyes
And deep inside my heart
I understand that I would

Follow you, way beyond the moon
Just to taste the lips I need so much
But most of all I see, the way you look at me
I won't leave this world unloved

It's the sweetest feeling
Now that I am sure
The lonely something, I will never be
And every night the stars come down to earth
As the light in your window waits for me
And I would

Follow you, way beyond the moon
Just to taste the lips I need so much
But most of all I see, the way you look at me
I won't leave this world unloved

I would follow you, way beyond the moon

It hurts me
To see you out with someone new
It hurts me
To long for you baby like I do
And I can't pretend
That the moment you walked in
It's easy to see
How it hurts me

I've tried to let your memory go
But there's somethings I can't control
It's more than I can take
There tears should make that plain but still
It's tears me up inside

[Chorus]

Foolish me for believing all this time
That somehow you would still be mine
But you've made it more than clear
That you no longer care
But I just wanted you to know

Ha pa mélé mwen kon sa ké ni maldon
Oh oh, han, paf è mwenyi, pa fè mwen’y woho
Si’w vlé ké pou nou dé sa kontinué
Ban fil pou mwen pé boujé

Ya ya yeah yeah
Ya ya yeah yeah
Ya ya yeah yeah
