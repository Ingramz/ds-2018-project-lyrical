Eddie Palmieri,"Acaricia mi sueño
El suave murmullo de tu suspirar
Como ríe la vida
Si tus ojos negros me quieren mirar
Y si es mío el amparo
De tu risa leve
Que es como un cantar
Ella quieta mi herida
Todo, todo se olvida

El día que me quieras
La rosa que engalana
Se vestirá de fiesta
Con su mejor color
Y al viento las campanas
Dirán que ya eres mía
Y locas las fontanas
Se contaran su amor

La noche que me quieras
Desde el azul del cielo
Las estrellas celosas
Nos miraran pasar
Y un rayo misterioso
Hará nido en tu pelo
Luciérnaga curiosa
Que vera que eres mi consuelo

El día que me quieras
No habrá mas que armonía
Será clara la aurora
Y alegre el manantial
Traerá quieta la brisa
Rumor de melodías
Y nos darán las fuentes
Su canto de cristal

El día que me quieras
Endulzara sus cuerdas
El pájaro cantor
Florecerá la vida
No existirá el dolor

La noche que me quieras",El Día Que Me Quieras,1992
Eddie Palmieri,"Muñeca quiero que me perdones 
Muñeca que yo no lo hago mas 
Me encontrastes en los brazos de otra nena 
Son Diversiones que no valen na 
Muñeca Yo a ti te quiero mucho 
Y si vuelves tendremos felicidad 
Te daré mi cariño y mi perdón 
Y Yo te juro que no lo hago mas 
Si mi muñeca y Yo te juro que no lo hago mas 

Ay mi muñeca perdóname 
(Perdóname, perdóname, perdóname.) Y veras 
Ay mi muñeca perdóname 
El amor y el interés se fueron al campo un día 
El amor y el interés oye se fueron al campo un dia 
Y mas pudo el interés que el amor que me tenia 

Ay mi muñeca perdóname 
(Perdóname, perdóname, perdóname) y veras 
Ay mi muñeca perdóname

Te quise más que a mi vida 
Más que a mi vida te quiero 
Te quiero mas que a mi vida oye 
Mas que a mi vida te quiero 
Pero mas quiero a mi vida si con ella sufro y muero

hasta el borde la copa de champan
que esta noche de farra y de alegria
el dolor que hay en mi alma quiero ahogar.
Es la ultima farra de mi vida
de mi vida muchachos que se va...
Mejor dicho se ha ido tras de aquella
que no supo mi amor nunca apreciar.

Yo la quise, muchachos y la quiero
y jamás yo la podre olvidar...
Yo me emborracho por ella
y ella quien sabe que hara`...
Eche mozo más champan,
que todo mi dolor
bebiendo lo he de ahogar
Y si la ven
amigos, diganle
que ha sido por su amor
que mi vida ya se fue`.

Y brindemos, no mas,
la ultima copa
que, tal vez, también ella ahora estara`
ofreciendo en algun brindis su boca
y otra boca febril la besara`.

Eddie Pazant,"Childhood part of my life, it wasn't very pretty.
You see, I was born and raised in the slums of the city,
It was a one room shack that slept ten other children besides me.
We hardly had enough food or room to sleep.
It was hard times,
Needed something to ease my troubled mind.
Listen!  my father didn't know the meaning of work,
He disrespected mama, and treated us like dirt.
I left home, seekin' a job that I never did find,
Depressed and downhearted I took to cloud nine,
I'm doin' fine, up here on cloud nine.
Listen one more time I'm doin' fine, up here on cloud nine.
Folks down there tell me,
They say, ""give yourself a chance son, don't let life pass you by"".
But the world of reality is a rat race where only the strongest survive,
It's a dog eat dog world, and that ain't no lie.
Listen!  it ain't even safe no more to walk the streets at night,
I'm doin' fine, on cloud nine.
Let me tell you about cloud nine.

Cloud nine, you can be what you wanna be
(cloud nine) you ain't got no responsibility,
And ev'ry man, ev'ry man is free
(cloud nine)  and you're a million miles from reality.
I wanna say I love the life I live,
And I'm gonna live the life I love up here on cloud nine.
I'm riding high
On cloud nine, you're as free as a bird in flight
(cloud nine)  there's no diff'rence between day and night
(cloud nine)  it's a world of love and harmony
(cloud nine)  you're a million miles from reality.

Cloud nine, you can be what you wanna be
Cloud nine) you ain't got no responsibility,
And ev'ry man, ev'ry man is free

Seek not your fortune in a dark dreary mine

I met her in Monterey, in old Mexico
Stars and steel guitars
And luscious lips, as red as wine
Broke somebody's heart

I see the sparkle of her eye
And when I hear the cello
Tender and sweet and mellow
I hear the music of her sigh

A beautiful theme of every
Dream I ever knew.
Down deep in my heart I hear it play.
I feel it start, then melt away.

I hear music when I touch your hand,
A beautiful melody
From some enchanted land.
Down deep in my heart, I hear it say,
Is this the day?

Why can't I let it go,
Why can't I let you know,

Stick a jazz band on my hearse wagon

When she walks by you don't know what to say.
You're gonna make your move; you better make it now
And don't be afraid 'cause love will show you how.
 
You take that first step: ask her out and treat her like a lady.
Second step: tell her she's the one you're dreaming of.
Third step: take her in your arms and never let her go.
Don't you know step by step; step by step you'll win her love.
 
She looks too beautiful to touch,
But your heart keeps talking to you.
Now, don't give up.
You think you see something in her eyes,
But you will never know until you try.
But you've got to take that first step:
 
ask her out and treat her like a lady.
Second step: tell her she's the one you're dreaming of.
Third step: take her in your arms and never let her go.
Don't you know step by step; step by step you'll win her love.
Second step. Third step. Don't you know, step by step; step by step.
 
You take that first step; ask her out and treat her like a lady.
Second step: tell her she's the one you're dreaming of.
Third step: take her in your arms and never let her go.

Lifted some stones
Saw the skin and bones
Of a city without a soul
I went out walking under an atomic sky
Where the ground wont turn
And the rain it burns
Like the tears when I said goodbye

Yeah I went with nothing
Nothing but the thought of you
I went wandering

I went drifting through the capitals of tin
Where men cant walk
Or freely talk
And sons turn their fathers in

Where the citizens like to sit
They say they want the kingdom
But they don't want God in it

I passed by a thousand signs
Looking for my own name

I went with nothing

But the thought you'd be there too
Looking for you

I went out there
In search of experience
To taste and to touch
And to feel as much
As a man can
Before he repents

I went out searching, lookin' for one good man
A spirit who would not bend or break
Who would sit at his fathers right hand
I went out walking with a Bible and a gun
The word of God lay heavy on my heart
I was sure I was the one
Now Jesus, don't you wait up
Jesus, Ill be home soon
Yeah I went out for the papers
Told her Id be back by noon

To decide who we are
Do we fight for the right
To a night at the opera now?

What's the price you might pay?
Is it simply a game
For a rich young boy to play?

Are changing day by day

You might know how it feels
To be struck to the bone
In a moment of breathless delight!
Had you been there today
You might also have known
How the world may be changed
In just one burst of light!
And what was right seems wrong
And what was wrong seems right!

Red I feel my soul on fire!
Black, my world if she's not there!

Black, is the color of despair!

It’s thanks to you that I am living
And again I lay down my life at your feet
Cosette, your father is a saint
When they wounded me
He took me from the barricade
Carried like a babe
And brought me home
To you

Now you are here
Again beside me
Now I can die in peace
For now my life is blessed

You will live, Papa, you're going to live
It's too soon, too soon to say goodbye!

Yes, Cosette, forbid me now to die
I'll obey
I will try.

On this page
I write my last confession
Read it well when I, at last, am sleeping
It's the story
Of one who turned from hating
The man who only learned to love
When you were in his keeping

Come with me
Where chains will never bind you
All your grief
At last, at last behind you
Lord in Heaven
Look down on him in mercy.

Forgive me all my trespasses
And take me to your glory.

Take my hand
I'll lead you to salvation
Take my love
For love is everlasting
And remember
The truth that once was spoken
To love another person
Is to see the face of God.

Do you hear the people sing
Lost in the valley of the night?
It is the music of the people
Who are climbing to the light.

For the wretched of the earth
There is a flame that never dies.
Even the darkest night will end
and the sun will rise.

They will live again in freedom
In the garden of the Lord.
We will walk behind the plowshare
We will put away the sword.
The chain will be broken
And all men will have their reward.

Will you join in our crusade?
Who will be strong and stand with me?
Somewhere beyond the barricade
Is there a world you long to see?
Do you hear the people sing?
Say, do you hear the distant drums?
It is the future that they bring
When tomorrow comes!

Eddie Redmayne,"In my life
She has burst like the music of angels
The light of the sun
And my life seems to stop
As if something is over
And something has scarcely begun.
Eponine
You're the friend who has brought me here
Thanks to you I am at one with the Gods
And Heaven is near!
And I soar through a world that is new that is free

Every word that he says is a dagger in me!
In my life
There's been no one like him anywhere
Anywhere, where he is
If he asked
I'd be his

In my life
There is someone who touches my life

Waiting near
Waiting here

A heart full of love
A heart full of song
I'm doing everything all wrong
Oh God, for shame
I do not even know your name
Dear Mademoiselle
Won't you say?
Will you tell?

A heart full of love
No fear, no regret
My name is Marius Pontmercy
And mine's Cosette
Cosette, I don't know what to say
Then make no sound
I am lost
I am found!

A heart full of love
(He was never mine to lose)
A heart full of you
(Why regret what cannot be?)
A single look and then I knew
I knew it too
(These are words he'll never say, not to me)
From today
(Not to me, no)

Every day
(His heart full of love)
For it isn't a dream
Not a dream after all

Somewhere along the Rio Grande
Sadly I'm reminiscing, madly again I'm kissing
Someone along the Rio Grande
 
It happened in Monterey, a long time ago
I met her in Monterey, in old Mexico
Stars and steel guitars
And luscious lips, as red as wine
Broke somebody's heart
And I'm afraid that it was mine
It happened in Monterey
Without thinking twice
I left her and threw away the key to paradise
My indiscreet heart, longs for the sweetheart 
That I left in old Monterey
 
Making believe I'm merry
In ev'ry glass of sherry
I see the sparkle of her eye
And when I hear the cello
Tender and sweet and mellow
I hear the music of her sigh

Not for a year but ever and a day
The radio and the telephone and the movies that we know
May just be passing fancies and in time may go

Together we're going a long, long way

Te convencí de mi amor casándonos de mañana 
Y seguimos amándonos y en la piel sepultando penas 
Y es que tu encierras tanto amor en tus venas 

Tu me quemas 
Cuando me rosan tus rodillas 
Tu me quemas 
Cuando me abrazas y me mimas 
Tu me quemas 
Ni el agua de los mares calmara esta hoguera 
Tu me quemas 
Tu me quemas 
Tu hierbes en mi sangre al mirarte nena 
Me vuelves loco y no convino mis ideas 
No se lo que me pasa y pierdo la cabeza 
En tus brazos, tu me quemas 

(fuego en la piel) 

(es que encierras tanto amor que tu me quemas) 
Chica contigo yo me siento un hombre nuevo 
Por que te hago sentir bien mujer 
(es que encierras tanto amor que tu me quemas) 
Tu me quemas con todo lo que encierras dentro de ti 
Y entre mas lo hacemos todavía mas queremos 
(es que encierras tanto amor que tu me quemas) 
Tu forma de querer es lo que yo había soñado 
Por eso es que te amo 
(es que encierras tanto amor que tu me quemas) 

(jugando a besarnos y a darnos cariño muchacha) 

(seguimos) 
(es que encierras tanto amor que tu me quemas) 
Nuestros cuerpos expresan emociones 
Y encuentran afinidad 
(es que encierras tanto amor que tu me quemas) 
Por eso, por eso,por eso es que nos gusta 
Cuando lo hacemos ya que sabemos disfrutar 
(es que encierras tanto amor que tu me quemas) 
Es que son exitantes nuestros momentos en la intimidad 
Que siempre vamos por mas 
(es que encierras tanto amor que tu me quemas) 
Y eso es amar",Tu Me Quemas,1990
Eddie Santiago,"Quédate, aquí esta noche, será la última vez, que te lo implore
Quédate, que más podría pasar, si él se llegara a enterar
Lo va a tener que aceptar
Quédate, te necesito, por que pagar nosotros tan alto sacrificio

No entiendes que estas a merced de un demente
El hace de ti lo que quiere y tu no le amas le temes
No entiendes que nada te impide dejarlo
Te hizo la vida pedazos y puedes rehacerla a mi lado
Decídete esta vez y quédate

Quédate, aquí conmigo, será una noche de amor y de delirios
Quédate, te necesito ¿por que pagar nosotros tan alto sacrificio?

Decídete esta vez y quédate y quédate

Un verdadero amor te espera, una nueva vida debes comenzar

Quédate conmigo y no tengas miedo
Se aprovecha de tu cariño y tu bondad y nunca te ha dado tu lugar 

Quédate conmigo y no tengas miedo
Será una noche inolvidable llena de pasión, amor y delirio

Quédate conmigo y no tengas miedo
No llores mi amor será la última vez que te lo implore 

Quédate conmigo y no tengas miedo
Es que nada te impide ya dejarlo quédate a mi lado","Tu No le Amas, le Temes",1990
Eddie Santiago,"Siempre intento de mi mente desprenderla
Cada día más falta me hace, quiero verla
Ya mis labios no soportan su ausencia
Voy cayendo en un abismo por tenerla

Y me amarra todo el vicio que ella esconde
Al consumirla me esta consumiendo a mi
Soy de ella más no es mía
Es placer y es agonía, es antidoto y veneno

Como droga que me mata a fuego lento
Cuerpo y carne sin nada de sentimiento
Quiere mi cuerpo y sólo eso sin amarlo
Y yo queriéndole más todo momento

Como droga que me mata a fuego lento
Cuerpo y carne sin nada de sentimiento
Cada hora crece el vicio por tenerla
Y me olvido que el amor no esta en su cuerpo

Como un loco busco formas de dejarla
Pero caigo a sus pies pobre infeliz
Ya mi vida esta cansada reclamandote
Y he fallado al querer obsesionarla

Y me amarra todo el vicio q ella esconde
Al consumirla me esta consumiendo a mi
Soy de ella mas no es mia
Es placer y es agonía, es antidoto y veneno

Como droga q me mata a fuego lento
Eres tu mi antidoto y veneno

De tal manera te deseo aunque me siento perdido
Estoy enviciado por tu cuerpo
No se si estoy viviendo o muriendo

Como droga q me mata a fuego lento
Eres tu mi antido y veneno

Y se q estoy poniendo en riego mi corazon
Ya q sólo tu estas de vacaciones
En nuestra relacion me matas o me usas

Como droga q me mata y q deseo
Eres tu mi antidoto y veneno
Estoy perdiddo en tus caprichos
En la trampa d tus besos
Eres tu mi antidoto y veneno

",Antidoto y Veneno,1990

Soy dominado o si domino
Me sentiré como un gigante
O tan pequeño como un niño

Se nos acercan para ver
Why aún conservan su brillar
Después de nuestro amanecer

why en la grandeza de ese instante

Que en la belleza de esa hora
El sol espera por nacer

Es imposible que puedas darte a un sólo hombre mucho tiempo
Para que vuelves, tú necesitas siempre besos diferentes
Cambias de cama por cada sol que a fin de noche sea naciente

Hoy he pensado no vivir más cosido a tu vestido
Hoy convencido de que tu cuerpo sólo busca variedad
Quieres brindar tu cruel deseo a los demás por temporada
Luego volar, por alcanzarte muchos se rompen sus alas

Para que vuelves, si fuiste ciega frente a todo mi tormento
Es imposible que puedas darte a un sólo hombre mucho tiempo
Para que vuelves, tú necesitas siempre besos diferentes
Cambias de cama por cada sol que a fin de noche sea naciente

Cambias de cama por cada sol que a fin de noche sea naciente
Cambias de cama por cada sol que a fin de noche sea naciente

Para que vuelves
Si en ti no está la seriedad amando
Para que vuelves
Buscas para tu cuerpo variedad

Para que vuelves
Tú necesitas besos diferentes
Para que vuelves
Quítate de mi vida, vete ya

Para que vuelves
Dime porque quiero saber
Para que vuelves
No puedes dar tu amor a un sólo hombre

Para que vuelves
Fuiste ciega frente a todo mi tormento
Para que vuelves
Para que vuelves, para que vuelves

",Para Que Vuelves,1996
Eddie Santiago,"Como viento huracanado 
Que a pesar de ver pasado 
Tiene su fuerza igual

Como rio desvocado 
Que con sus aguas arrastras 
Todo lo que pueda hallar

Como mar soberbio que cubre 
La arena corren por mis venas 
Las ganas de amarte como un volcan 

Volcán de amor ese soy yo 
Cuando pienso en ti 
Volcán de fuego 
Hombre sin miedo solo por ti

No te pido me perdones 
Por querer besar tu boca 
Y quererte acariciar 

Es que cuando estoy contigo 
Hasta de mi yo me olvido 
Y no me puedo controlar 
Como mar soberbio que cubre la arena 
Corren por mis venas

Las ganas de amarte como un volcan 

Volcán de amor ese soy yo 
Cuando pienso en ti 
Volcán de fuego 
Hombre sin miedo solo por ti

Como volcán de fuego caliente mami

Volcán de amor ese soy yo 
Por que me gustas 
En mi despiertas 
La llama de deseo 

Volcán de amor ese soy yo 
No me puedo contener 
Cuando te tengo a mi lado 
Por eso te reclamo 

Volcán de amor ese soy yo 
El tenerte y disfrutrate 
Volver hacerlo contigo ahora y siempre 

Volcán de amor ese soy yo 
Tu eres la achica que deseo 
Eres la que enciende mi fuego

Tengo ganas

Volcán de amor ese soy yo 
Y piensa bien lo que estoy pidiendo 
Decídete y no pierdas tiempo 
Volcán de amor ese soy yo 
Ya tu fuiste mía no hace mucho 

Vengame otra vez 
Vengame otra vez 
Vengame ora vez 
Vengame otra vez

Soy volcan de amor por ti y no lo niego",Volcan de Amor,1996
Eddie Santiago,"Tu amante
Yo no debo alejarme de ti 
Si lo único que hago bien, es amarte 
En todo lo demás vivo intentando 
Solo tu puedes salvarme 
Es algo infantil lo que te pido 
Soy consciente se precisan otras cosas, otras cosas 
No se vive solamente de cariño 
Y en un páramo suelen nacer las rosas 
Solo puedo prometerte que a mi lado 
No podrá abrumarte la rutina 
Estarás de sobresalto en sobresalto 
Llenare cada rincón de nuestras vidas 
Hoy te propongo que compartas mi bohemia 
Y que sepas valorar a la pobreza 
Será como vivir en una isla, a la voz naturaleza 

Por eso yo no debo alejarme de ti 
Si lo único que hago bien, es amarte 
No hagas que me sienta un ser inútil 
Ahora que ya se a que dedicarme 
Hay infinidad de carpinteros 
Y no se que cantidad de comerciantes 
Hoy descubrí que soy, de profesión 
Tu amante, no lo olvides 

Hoy yo descubrí que soy tu amante 
Sin darme cuenta comprendí que tu 
Eres lo mejor de mis momentos 
Hoy yo descubrí que soy tu amante 
El amor que vivimos tan loco y 
Apresurado es nuestro escape del mundo que nos rodea 
Hoy yo descubrí que soy tu amante 
Ser amante es respirar placer en lo mejor de cada instante 
Hoy yo descubrí que soy tu amante 
Tu tienes picardía y fuego en la piel 
Me excitas a que te tenga que querer 
Hoy yo descubrí que soy tu amante 
Caramba que bien mezclan nuestros 
Pensamientos cuando el amor vamos hacer 
Hoy yo descubrí que soy tu amante 
Es que tu tienes esa magia que me hace enloquecer",De Profesion...Tu Amante,1996
Eddie Santiago,"Todo empezó en el invierno pasado (que bien) 
Me enamoré sin querer y sin pensarlo (ya ves) 
Creí tener la oportunidad de amar y ser feliz 
Cuando descubrí tanto amor junto a ti

Todo empezó en el momento indicado (que bien) 
Ojos café, un blue jeans medio gastado (recién) 
Te vi pasar desde mi carro y me arroje detrás de ti 
¿Quieres caminar conmigo si?

Y juntos nos fuimos del brazo con la tarde a cuesta 
La brisa riendo en tu cara de niña traviesa 
Y juntos nos fuimos del brazo con la tarde a cuesta 
La noche llegó con un beso y miradas inquietas 
Y unas copas que se suben poco a poco a la cabeza 
Y un abrazo cuerpo a cuerpo y en la puerta la inocencia 

Todo empezó en el momento indicado (que bien) 
Mi corazón ya estaba decepcionado, sin fe 
Pero tu amor cambió mi suerte y yo estoy aquí amándote 
Y después de amar te amaré aún mas",Todo Empezo,1996
Eddie Santiago,"Pasan los días y tú

A pesar que esta vida nos vuelve más desconfiados 
Tu y yo ponemos la magia y ganas para intentarlo 
Y si acomodo mi cuerpo a tu silueta dormida 
No es que me falte calor sino que tu me das vida 

Porque nadie mejor que tú

Porque no hay nadie mejor que tú

Para conquistar mis sentimientos 

Pues no hay nadie como tú

Porque nadie como tú 
Tu has sabido atraparme 

Nadie como tú
Con tu cariño sincero 

Porque nadie mejor que tú

Eddie Santiago,"La noche queda atrás por
Nuestro ventanal se asoma el día
Y siento tu calor aferrado a mi piel
Estas dormida

No se sí despertarte con un beso
Me siento tan feliz al contemplarte
Quisiera por tus sueños internarme
Que nadie nos separé

En esta habitación vivimos nuestro
Amor del mundo oculto
Sabiendo que después vendrá la
Realidad así es la vida

No sé cómo expresarte lo que siento
Es breve nuestro amor y es tan inmenso
Quisiera entre tus barcos refugiarme
Que nadie nos separé

Quisiera detener el tiempo
Y olvidar las horas
Porque la dicha es un instante
Y yo la siento ahora

No sé si despertarte con un beso
Me siento tan feliz al contemplarte
Quisiera por tus sueños internarme
Que nadie nos separé

Es breve pero es inmenso
Este momento de amor
Tú y yo recibiendo la mañana
En la cama haciéndolo

Es breve pero es inmenso
Este momento de amor
Es breve el tiempo pero el disfrute
Que conseguimos nos llena

Es breve pero es inmenso
Este momento de amor
Como me quieres tú como te quiero yo
Vale la pena vivir

Tu respirar agitado y tus
Suspiros me excitan

Es breve pero es inmenso
Este momento de amor
Viviendo este amor oculto
Es como vivir nuestro propio mundo

Es breve pero es inmenso
Este momento de amor
Cuando lo hacemos
La entrega es mutua

Es breve pero es inmenso
Este momento de amor
Me gusta contemplarte desnuda
Siempre que estas en mi lecho

Es breve pero es inmenso
Este momento de amor
Que sea interminable
Este momento

Eddie Santiago,"Viví fingiendo que este amor es el mejor 
Andar trampeándole a la vida sin razón 
Seguí mintiendo en una soledad de a dos 
Si a ayer lo nuestro fue continua creación 
Porque… 
Sufrimos tanto en nuestra intimidad 
Tratando en vano de disimular 
Que ya gastamos el tiempo de amar 

Y ya no aguanto más 
Si me hablas solamente es para reprochar 
Esas cosas que queriendo hacer bien hice mal 
Ya no aguanto te lo juro 
Ante mi se calla el mundo 
Y que hago aquí sin ti 

Y ya ni aguanto más 
Cada día es un infierno un error fatal 
Ya nos dimos todo aquello que pudimos dar 
Ya no aguanto te lo juro 
Ante mi se calla el mundo 
Y que hago aquí sin ti 

Adiós 
Si alguna vez entiendes este amor 
Será muy tarde para volver a empezar 
Me voy 
Porque no quiero continuar así 
Tomado de tu mano me perdí 
Anclado en tu puerto naufrague 

Y ya no aguanto más 
Si me hablas solamente es para reprochar 
Esas cosas que queriendo hacer bien hice mal 
Y ya no aguanto te lo juro

Todo el desorden y tu la mujer habilitada 
Dos desayunos señor para la suit 911 
No tema usted si al llamar solo el silencio responde 
Y es que estamos amándonos

Y es que tu encierras tanto amor en tus venas

Cuando me abrazas y me mimas

En una cama de hotel tu y yo en silencio en el alma 
Dos cuerpos muertos de sed entre unas sabanas blancas 
Casi dos meses después cuando ni tu lo esperabas 
Te convencí de mi amor casándonos de mañana 
Y seguimos amándonos y en la piel sepultando penas

Te prometí serte fiel pero no, no

But who wants to be in love in vain
At night you hang around the hall
And eat your heart out
And cry your eyes out
And rack your brains

You sit and wonder why anyone as wonderful as she
Should cause you such misery and pain
I thought that I would be in Heaven
But I'm only up a tree
Cause it's just my luck to be in love in vain.

Let me tell you, a fortune like that once was mine

When I lost her I was lost beyond despair

The distant moanin' of a train

It still comes out the same
No matter how you look at it, think of it

So I take out my guitar to pass some time
Late at night when it's hard to rest

Telephone every town I know
I'm gonna write a letter

She be in East Monroe I know

And I don't want no woman
Wants every downtown man she meets
No, I don't want no woman

Eddie Skuller,"I lost myself on a cool damp night
I gave myself in that misty light
Was hypnotized by a strange delight
Under a lilac tree

I made wine from the lilac tree
Put my heart in its recipe
It makes me see what I want to see 
And be what I want to be

When I think more than I want to think
I do things I never should do
I drink much more that I ought to drink
Because it brings me back you
 
Lilac wine is sweet and heady, like my love
Lilac wine, I feel unsteady, like my love
Listen to me, I cannot see clearly
Isn't that she, coming to me nearly here? 

Lilac wine is sweet and heady where's my love?
Lilac wine, I feel unsteady, where's my love?

Until you've loved a love you've had  to lose,

Until you've kissed and had to pay the cost,
Until you've flipped your heart and you have lost,
You don't know what love is.

Do you know how a lost heart fears
At the thought of reminiscing,
And how lips that taste of tears
Lose their taste for kissing?

A little room where all the roses bloom
I want to lead you into Nature's hall
Where ev'ry year the roses give a ball
They have an orchestra up in the trees
For their musicians are the birds and bees
And they will sing us a song
As we are strolling along
 
In sunny Roseland, where summer breezes are playing
Where the honey bees are ""A-Maying""
There all the roses are swaying
Dancing while the meadow brook flows
The moon when shining is more than ever designing
For 'tis ever then I am pining
Pining to be sweetly reclining
Somewhere in Roseland
Beside a beautiful rose
 
The ball is over and tulips meet
Their little kisses are so short and sweet
The lilies nod to the forget-me-nots
When they're departing in their flower pots
But all the roses with their spirits high
Remain to love until they droop and die
And dear, why shouldn't it be
Just so with you and with me

And if you fall, you fall,
And I'm thinking I wouldn't mind at all.
Love is tearful or it's gay.
It's a problem or it's play,
It's a heartache either way,
But beautiful!

And I'm thinking if you were mine
I'd never let you go,
And that would be but beautiful I know.",But Beautiful,1984

Close to the sun in the day
Near to the moon at night

Have you anything to say to me?
Won't you tell me where my love can be?
Is there a meadow in the mist
Where someone's waiting to be kissed?

Have you seen a valley green with spring?
Where my heart can go a journeying
Over the shadows and the rain
To a blossom covered lane

Haven't you heard the music in the night?
Wonderful music, faint as a will o' the wisp
Crazy as a loon, sad as a gypsy serenading the moon

But my heart is riding on your wings
So if you see them anywhere

Has left her hopeless and lost

Till all the pain
Just disappears
I will always stay
Till all this light
Just kills the day

Once, I tried a thousand times
Slaughtered like Gods
When the silver shines so hard

I tried to poison my life
Always dreaming on the edge of the knife

And I can sit here for even ten minutes or more

You could not speak, you were afraid
To take the risk of being left again
And so you tipped your hat and waved and then
You turned back up the gangway of that steel tomb again

And in Mott street in July
When I hear those seabirds cry
I hold the child, the child in the man
The child that we leave behind

And in the silence of the grave

The men were gone until the west was won
And now there's nothing left but time to kill
You never took us fishin' dad and now you never will

And I show my true colors when we paint the town
I hate to hear you cry, I don't like the sound
So my love is turned up, sheets get turned down
I know it hurts now, the drama's the worst now
It's forth in a hundred but love's a first down

I used to be a Casanova in the lunch room line
That is more important things occupying my mind
Like being there for you, breathing the air for you
Keep trust false and truth to dare for you
The weight of the world I'm prepared to bear for you
The haters get cynical and call you spoiled
Not knowing about the drama in which you embroiled
The numerous pit falls, the tussle and the toil
The farmer still want me to put seeds in the soil
And here comes the harvest, this part's the hardest
I'm still here in darkness

Eddie Vedder,"Come, you masters of war
You that build all the guns
You that build the death planes
You that build the big bombs
You that hide behind walls
You that hide behind desks
I just want you to know
I can see through your masks

You that never done nothin'
But build to destroy
You play with my world
Like it's your little toy
You put a gun in my hand
And you hide from my eyes
And you turn and run farther
When the fast bullets fly

Like Judas of old
You lie and deceive
A world war can be won
You want me to believe
But I see through your eyes
And I see through your brain
Like I see through the water
That runs down my drain

You fasten the triggers
For the others to fire
Then you set back and watch
When the death count gets higher
You hide in your mansion
As young people's blood
Flows out of their bodies
And is buried in the mud

You've thrown the worst fear
That can ever be hurled
Fear to bring children
Into the world
For threatening my baby
Unborn and unnamed
You ain't worth the blood
That runs in your veins

How much do I know?
To talk out of turn
You might say that I'm young
You might say I'm unlearned
But there's one thing I know
Though I'm younger than you
Even Jesus would never
Forgive what you do

Let me ask you one question
Is your money that good?
Will it buy you forgiveness?
Do you think that it could?
I think you will find
When your death takes its toll
All the money you made
Will never buy back your soul

And I hope that you die
And your death'll come soon
I will follow your casket
In the pale afternoon
And I'll watch while you're lowered
Down to your deathbed
And I'll stand o'er your grave
'Till I'm sure that you're dead",Masters of War,1993

And this is not our fate
So let us not talk falsely now
The hour is getting late

All along the watchtower
Princes kept the view
While all the women came and went
Barefoot servants, too

Outside in the distance
A wildcat did growl
Two riders were approaching
The wind began to howl

to be so inclined

Why sleep
in discontent?
Oh the price
of companionship

My shadow runs with me
underneath the Big Wide Sun
My shadow comes with me
as we leave it all
we leave it all Far Behind

Empty pockets will
Allow a greater
Sense of wealth

Why contain yourself
Like any other
Book on the shelf

My shadow lays with me
underneath the Big Wide Sun
My shadow stays with me
as we leave it all

Hear the truth they're telling
A world begins where the road ends
Watch me leave it all behind

Far Behind",Far Behind,2007
Eddie Vedder,"On bended knee is no way to be free
Lifting up an empty cup I ask silently
That all my destinations will accept the one that's me
So I can breath

Circles they grow and they swallow people whole
Half their lives they say goodnight to wive's they'll never know
Got a mind full of questions and a teacher in my soul
So it goes

Don't come closer or I'll have to go
Holding me like gravity are places that pull
If ever there was someone to keep me at home
It would be you

Everyone I come across in cages they bought
They think of me and my wandering
But I'm never what they thought
Got my indignation but I'm pure in all my thoughts
I'm alive

Wind in my hair, I feel part of everywhere
Underneath my being is a road that disappeared
Late at night I hear the trees
They're singing with the dead
Overhead

Leave it to me as I find a way to be
Consider me a satellite for ever orbiting
I knew all the rules but the rules did not know me
Guaranteed",Guaranteed,2007
Eddie Vedder,"When I walk beside her
I am the better man
When I look to leave her

So I could worship from above
And when I climbed down to be set free
She took me in again

There's a big
A big hard sun
Beaten on the big people
In the big hard world

When she comes to greet me
She is mercy at my feet
When I see her pin her charm
She just throws it back again
Once I dug an early grave
To find a better land
She just smiled and laughed at me
And took her blues back again

There's a big
A big hard sun
Beaten on the big people
In the big hard world

There's a big
A big hard sun
Beaten on the big people
In the big hard world

When I go to cross that river
She is comfort by my side
When I try to understand
She just opens up her eyes

There's a big
A big hard sun
Beaten on the big people
In the big hard world

Once I stood to lose her
When I saw what I had done
Bound down and flew away the hours
Of her garden and her sun
So I tried to warn her
I'll turn to see her weep
Forty days and forty nights
And it's still coming down on me

There's a big
A big hard sun
Beaten on the big people
In the big hard world

There's a big

But why should I try to resist when, darling, I know so well
I've got you under my skin?

I'd sacrifice anything, come what might
For the sake of having you near
In spite of a warning voice that comes in the night
And repeats, repeats in my ear
Don't you know, little fool, you never can win?

But each time that I do, just the thought of you
Makes me stop before I begin

Come on home and fool around with me

I wasn't foolin' around the day I said I do

I know it's foolish taking all this misery
But when it's you, a fool I'll always be

Eddie Zandy,"When an early autumn walks the land and chills the breeze
And touches with her hand the summer trees,
Perhaps you'll understand what memories I own.
There's a dance pavilion in the rain all shuttered down,

A winding country lane all russet brown,
A frosty window pane shows me a town grown lonely.
That spring of ours that started so April-hearted,
Seemed made for just a boy and girl.

I never dreamed, did you, any fall would come in view
So early, early.
Darling if you care, please, let me know,
I'll meet you anywhere, I miss you so.

Eddie Zandy,"A country dance was being held in a garden
I felt a bump and heard an ""Oh, beg your pardon""
Suddenly I saw polka dots and moonbeams
All around a pug-nosed dream

The music started and was I the perplexed one
I held my breath and said ""May I have the next one?""
In my frightened arms, polka dots and moonbeams
Sparkled on a pug-nosed dream

There were questions in the eyes of other dancers
As we floated over the floor
There were questions but my heart knew all the answers
And perhaps a few things more

Now in a cottage built of lilacs and laughter
I know the meaning of the words ""Ever after""

Were searching for a diff'rent tune
One that they could croon 
As only they can

They only had the rhythm so
They started swaying to and fro
They didn't know just what they had
And that is how the blues really began

They heard the breeze in the trees
Singing weird melodies
And they made that 
The start of the blues

And from a jail came the wail
Of a down hearted frail
And they played that 
As part of the blues

From a whippoorwill out on a hill
They took a new note
Pushed it through a horn
'til it was born into a blue note

And then they nursed it, rehearsed it

That the southland 
Gave birth to the blues!",Birth of the Blues,2001

Stars were peek-a-booing down
'Twas on a night like this

And rounds up the cattle each fall.

Guess I'll stay broken hearted how's the world treating you

Eddy Arnold,"How many arms have held you
And hated to let you go
How many, how many I wonder
But I really don't want to know

How many lips have kissed you
And set your soul aglow
How many, how many I wonder
But I really don't want to know

So always make me wonder
Always make me guess
And even if I ask you darling
Don't confess

Just let it remain me and your secret
But darling I love you so
No wonder, no wonder I wonder
No, I really don't want to know

Told everyone bout my darling of the happiness I found
My heart would cry more than the weeping willow tree
If my darling and her heart were not for me

Twas worn by my redeemer who lives eternaly)

Kings wear robes of gold and velvet soon their glory fades away
But the king of kings in heaven wore a homespun robe that day
Soldiers gambled for his garment while the sun turned dark above
But the men who crucified him were forgiven by his love

His robe his robe...

Those who saw his robe knew torment if they lived by sin and fault
But if they renounce the evil they were welcome by the Lord
Though it seems so plain and humble there was fate in every breath
He who wore that lives forever he has risen from the death

",Wanderin',1955
Eddy Arnold,"I am a poor wayfaring stranger
While journeying through this world of woe;
And there's no sickness, toil nor danger
In that bright land to which I go.

I'm going there to see my Father,
I'm going there no more to roam;
I'm only go-going over Jordan,
I'm only go-going over home.

I know dark clouds will gather 'round me,
I know my way is rough and steep;
And beautiful fields lie just before me,
Where God's redeemed there vigils keep.

I'm going there to see my Father,
I'm going there no more to roam;
I'm only go-going over Jordan,
I'm only go-going over home.

I'm going there to see my mother,
I'm going there no more to roam;
I'm only go-going over Jordan,
I'm only go-going over home.

I want to wear that crown of glory,
When I get home to that good land;
Well I want to shout salvation's story,
In concert with ohh the blood-washed band,

I'm going there to see my Savior,
I'm going there no more to roam;
I'm only go-going over Jordan,
I'm only go-going over home.",The Wayfaring Stranger,1955

Eddy Arnold,"When I was a young man courtin' the girls
I played me a waiting game
If a maid refused me with tossing curls
I let the old earth take a couple of whirls
While I plied her with tears in lieu of pearl
And as time came around she came my way
As time came around she came

Oh it's a long long while from May to December
But the days grow short when you reach September
When the autumn weather turns the leaves to flame

Oh I was born to wander oh I was born to roam

My teacher was a gambler the slickest one afloat
He taught me not to gamble on a petticoat

Eddy Arnold,"As I walked out in the streets of Laredo, 
As I walked out in Laredo one day, 
I spied a young cowboy wrapped up in white linen, 
Wrapped in white linen as cold as the clay.

""Oh beat the drums slowly and play the fife lowly;
Sing the Death March as you carry me along. 
Take me to the valley, there lay the sod o'er me, 
I'm a young cowboy and know IÃ¯Â¿Â½ve done wrong.""

""I see by your outfit that you are a cowboy."" 
These words he did say as I boldly walked by. 
""Come sit down beside me and hear my sad story; 
Got shot in the breast and I know I must die!"" 

""My friends and relations they live in the Nation:
They know not where their dear boy has gone.
I first came to Texas and hired to a ranchman,
Oh I'm a young cowboy and I know I've done wrong.""

""It was once in the saddle I used to go dashing:
It was once in the saddle I used to go gay.
First to the dram house and then to the card house,
Got shot in the breast and I'm dying today.""

""Get six jolly cowboys to carry my coffin;
Get six pretty maidens to sing me a song.
Put bunches of roses all over my coffin,
Put roses to deaden the sods as they fall.""

""Go gather around you a group of young cowboys,
And tell them the story of this my sad fate.
Tell one and the other before they go further,
To stop their wild roving before it's too late.""

""Oh, bury me beside my knife and my shooter,
My spurs on my heels, my rifle by my side.
And over my coffin put a bottle of brandy,
That the cowboys may drink as they carry me along.""

""Go fetch me some water, a cool cup of water 
To cool my parched lips,"" the poor cowboy then said. 
Before I returned his spirit had left him 
Had gone to his Maker, the cowboy was dead. 

We beat the drum slowly and played the fife lowly,
And bitterly wept as we bore him along.

We all loved our comrade although he'd done wrong.",The Streets of Laredo,1959

From the queen of flowin' mountains to the south bells by the shore
She's mighty tall and handsome and known quite well by all
She's the combination of the Wabash Cannonball

As she glides along the woodland through the hills and by the shore
Hear the mighty rush of the engine hear that lonesome hoboes call
You're trav'ling through the jungle on the Wabash Cannonball

She came down from Birmingham one cold December day
As she rolled into the station you could hear the people say
There's a girl from Tennessee she's long and she's tall
She came down from Birmingham on the Wabash Cannonball

I'm richer now than any man has any right to be
Health and love and happiness have been my cup of tea
The richest man in all creation surely it is me

I've got water in my well and heaven in my heart
I have a perfect woman I can trust when we're apart
Cash enough to see a show and eat out now and then
A roof a bed a fishing pole and folks who call me friend

I got a humpack mule a plow and a tater patch...

I don't have much bank account my cash on hand is small
But tell me what are riches but contentment after all
Other folks may think I'm poor but I know it's not so
Cause when I count my blessings I'm the richest man I know

Now the rich folks talk about the grub they eat
Now I've got all those rich folks beat
Cause I've got a field of yellow yams
And a smokehouse filled with country hams
Talk to me about caviar
They ain't nothing but fish eggs packed in a jar
I got a whole pond of big round trout
Fish eggs what are they talking about
Hey I got no fancy swimming pool but the creek in the woods
Is deep and cool I'm a lucky man I'm a lucky fool

Moody River your muddy water took my baby's life

Last Saturday evening I came to the old oak tree
That stands beside the river where you were to meet me
On the ground your glove I found with a note addressed to me
It read dear love I've done you wrong now I must set you free
No longer can I live with this hurt and this sin
I just couldn't tell you that guy was just a friend

And it took his final trip to the Promised Land

Casey Jones we're gonna reach Frisco

Casey pulled up that Reno hill
He whistled for the crossing with an awful shrill
The switchman knew by the engine's moan
That the man at the throttle was Casey Jones

He pulled up within two miles of the place
There number four stared him straight in the face
He turned to his fireman, said, ""Boy, you'd better jump
'Cause there's two locomotives that are going to bump""

""There're two more roads that I'd like to ride""

When your sweet lips smile to greet me it's my pleasure

Every little thing I'd do for you it only pleases me when it pleases you
Just to see the smile upon your face only makes me love you more

It's my pleasure to be near you it's my pleasure when I hear you
Say you'll always want me near you for it's my pleasure

It's my pleasure just to please you...

Now I'm taking that game up and the ace of hearts is high.
Things are mending now, I see a rainbow blending now.
We'll have a happy ending now, takin' a chance on love.

Here I slip again, about to take that trip again.
I got that grip again, takin' a chance on love.
Now I prove again that I can make life move again.
Um - I'm in the groove again, takin' a chance on love.

I walk around with a horse shoe, in clover I lie.

Eddy Arnold,"YESTERDAY WHEN I WAS YOUNG
Writers Charles Aznavour, Herbert Kretzmer

Yesterday when I was young the taste of life was sweet as rain upon my tongue. I teased at life as if it were a foolish game, the way the evening breeze may tease a candle flame. The thousand dreams I dreamed, the splendid things I planned I always built alas on weak and shifting sand. I lived by night and shunned the naked light of the day and only now I see how the years ran away. Yesterday when I was young so many drinking songs were waiting to be sung, so many wayward pleasures lay in store for me and so much pain my dazzled eyes refused to see. I ran so fast that time and youth at last ran out, I never stopped to think what life was all about and every conversation I can now recall concerned itself with me and nothing else at all. Yesterday the moon was blue and every crazy day brought something new to do. I used my magic age as if it were a wand and never saw the waste and emptiness beyond. The game of love I played with arrogance and pride and every flame I lit too quickly quickly died. The friends I made all seemed somehow to drift away and only I am left on stage to end the play. There are so many songs in me that won't be sung; I feel the bitter taste of tears upon my tongue. The time has come for me to pay for yesterday when I was young.



",Yesterday When I Was Young,1969
Eddy Arnold,"Your walls are lines with pictures of your triumphs through the years
Your doors is bolted tight against all wordly want and fear
But you left your passion and your pain with your first love back in school
You fool you fool

In your penthouse high from the dirty streets I swear you'll never find
The answers to the questions that muddy up your mind
For your window shades are drawn upon the wicked and the cruel
You fool you fool

You give your share the charity without a second thought
And you are kind to animals for that's what you've been taught
But all your real emotion you proudly overrule
You fool you fool

You've planned your life so carefully for society's delight
And still you can't quite understand why things just don't seem right
It's a love like fresh out homemade bread will sat aside to cool
You fool you fool you fool",You Fool,1969
Eddy Arnold,"I just can't help believin'
When she smiles up soft and gentle
With a trace of misty mornin'
And the promise of tomorrow in her eyes

And I just can't help believin'
When she's lyin' close beside me
And my heart beats with the rhythm of her sighs

This time the girl is gonna stay
This time the girl is gonna stay for more than just a day

I just can't help believin'
When she slips her hand in my hand
And it feels so small and helpless
That my fingers fold around it like a glove

And I just can't help believin'
When she's whisperin' her magic
And her tears are shinin' honey sweet with love

Eddy Arnold,"Nothing's quite as pretty as Mary in the morning
When through a sleepy haze I see her lying there
Soft as the rain that falls on summer flowers
Warm as the sunlight shining on her golden hair

When I awake I see her there so close beside me
I want to take her in my arms
The ache is there so deep inside me

Nothing's quite as pretty as Mary in the morning
Chasing the rainbow in her dreams so far away
And when she turns to touch me I kiss her face so softly
And then my Mary wakes to love another day

And Mary's there in summer days or stormy weather
She doesn't care, or right or wrong the love we share
We share together

Kissed by the shades of night and starlight in her hair
And as we walk I hold her close beside me

Except to shade my eyes against the sun, that rises over land

But dreaming was as easy as believing it was never gonna end

We had corn in the fields and whaet in the bins

And they all had the sweethearts a knockin' at the door

A beautiful sight we're happy tonight walking in the winter wonderland

In the meadow we can build the snowman we'll pretend that he is Parson Brown
He'll say are you merry we'll say no man but you can do the job when you're in town

Later on we'll conspire as we dream by the fire
The face on the frame the vows that we made walking in the winter wonderland

In the meadow we can build the snowman and pretend that he's a Sacos Clown
We'll have lots of fun with Mr Snowman until the other kiddies knock him down

Have you ever stopped to wonder what kind of place this would be
If the whole world stopped lovin' the way you stopped lovin' me
If every heart was broken the way that you broke my own
And the whole world stopped lovin' how long would living go on
Hear the church bells in the steeple as they ring their song through the air
If the whole world stopped lovin' there'd be no steeple bells there
The tears would fill the river till the rivers flooded the sea
If the whole world stopped lovin' the way you stopped lovin' me

Addin' redskin arrows to the country's woes

So he shoulders his rifle and off he goes

Off through the woods he's a marchin' along
Makin' up yarns and a singin' a song

Till the Creeks was whipped an' peace was in store
An' while he was handlin' this risky chore
Made hisself a legend for evermore

So he packed his gear and his trusty gun
And lit out grinnin' to follow the sun

To the Texas plains he just had to go
Where freedom was fightin' another foe

Where the coyotes howl and the wind blows free
And when I die you can bury me

And under his knees was a raging black stallion
And lopin' behind was a bay

His lips that were sad and tight
His little lost love lay asleep on the hillside
His heart was heavy as night

He's ridin' and hidin' his pain
Don't fight him, don't spite him, just wait till tomorrow

Watched as he passed her way

Meant more to him than life
For this was the horse his little lost darlin' was ridden
When she was his wife

The yellow haired lady came down to the tavern
Looked up the stranger there
He bought her a drink and he gave her some money
He just didn't seem to care

She followed him out as he saddled his stallion
And laughed as she grabbed at the bay
But he shot her so quick they had no time to warn her
She never heard anyone say

Don't cross him, don't boss him

Yippee-yi-ay, yippee-yi-o,

Their brands were still on fire and their hooves wuz made of steel,
Their horns wuz black and shiny and their hot breath he could feel,
A bolt of fear went through him as they thundered thru the sky,
For he saw the riders comin' hard
And he heard their mournful cry.

Their faces gaunt their eyes were blurred and shirts all soaked
with sweat,

On horses snortin' fire
As they ride on, hear their cry.

As the riders loped on by him he heard one call his name,

Tell him my world's made for two

Just what you're gonna do

Loves somebody new

The cattle are lowing, the poor Babe awakes, But little Lord Jesus no crying He makes, I love, Thee, Lord Jesus, look down from the sky And stay by my cradle 'til morning is nigh. Be near me, Lord Jesus, I ask Thee to stay Close by me forever and ever I pray. Bless all the dear children in Thy tender care And lead us to heaven to live with Thee there.

My friend I'll say it clear I'll state my case of which I'm certain
I've lived a life that's full I've traveled each and every highway
And more much more than this I did it my way

Regrets I've had a few but then again too few to mention
I did what I had to do and saw it through without exemption
I planned each chartered course each careful step along the byway
And more much more than this I did it my way

Yes there were times I'm sure you knew when I bit off more than I could chew
But through it all when there was doubt I ate it up and spit it out
I faced it all and I stood tall and did it my way

I've loved I've laughed and cried I've had my fill my share of losing
And now as tears subside I find it all so amusing
To think I did all that and may I say not in a shy way
Oh no oh no not me I did it my way

For what is a man what has he got if not himself then he has not
To say the things he truly feels and not the words of one who kneels
The record shows I took the blows and did it my way
And did it my way




",My Way,1997

That thrills and delights me, oh no 
It's just the nearness of you 
It isn't your sweet conversation

It's just the nearness of you 

When you're in my arms and I feel you so close to me 
All my wildest dreams come true

To hold you ever so tight 

And to feel in the night the nearness of you",The Nearness of You,1997
Eddy Arnold,"Smile though your heart is aching smile even though it's breaking

Eddy Arnold,"It's knowing that your door is always open
And your path is free to walk
That makes me tend to leave my sleeping bag rolled up
And stashed behind your couch

It's knowing I'm not shackled by forgotten words and bons
And the ink stains that have dried upon some line
That keeps you in the back roads by the rivers of my memory
That keeps you ever gentle on my mind

It's not clinging to the rocks
And I'd be planted on their columns now that bind me
Or something that somebody said
Because they thought we fit together walking

It's knowin' that the world will not be cursin' or forgiving
When I walk along some railroad track and find
You're movin' on the back roads by the rivers of my memory
And for hours you're just gentle on my mind

Though the wheat fields and the clothes lines
And the junk yards and the highways come between us
And some other woman crying to her mother
'Cause she turned and I was gone

I still run in silence, tears of joy stain my face
And a summer sun might burn me till I'm blind
But not to where I cannot see you walking on the back roads
By the rivers flowing gentle on my mind
",Gentle on My Mind,1997
Eddy Arnold,"And I wake up in the mornin'
With my hair down in my eyes and she says, ""Hi""
And I stumble to the breakfast table
While the kids are goin' off to school, goodbye

And she reaches out and takes my hand and squeezes it
Says, ""How you feelin', hon?""
And I look across at smilin' lips
That warm my heart and see my morning sun

And if that's not lovin' me then all I've got to say

God didn't make little green apples
And it don't rain in Indianapolis in the summertime
There's no such thing as Doctor Seuss
Disneyland and Mother Goose is no nursery rhyme

God didn't make little green apples
And it don't rain in Indianapolis in the summertime
And when myself is feelin' low
I think about her face aglow to ease my mind

Sometimes I call her up at home knowin' she's busy
And ask her if she could get away and meet me
And grab a bite to eat

And she drops what she's doing
And hurries down to meet me and I'm always late
But she sits waitin' patiently and smiles when she first sees me
Cause she's made that way

And if that's not lovin' me then all I've got to say

God didn't make little green apples
And it don't snow in Minneapolis when the winter comes
There's no such think as make believe
The puppy dogs and autumn leaves and the BB guns

I pray the Lord that I'll grow stronger as I live from day to day

No way on earth to gain peace of mind
Now I'm happy in the chapel where people are of one accord

There is only one true answer he must get down on his knees

Your burdens will be lighter and you'll surely find your way

I asked a little boy to call his daddy He said he couldn't and sighed And when I asked him what was wrong Here's what the little boy replied. My Daddy is only a picture, In a frame that hangs on the wall Each day I talk to my daddy, But he never talks at all. I tell him all of my secrets And all of my little plans And from the way he smiles at me, I know he understands. The angels took Daddy to heaven, When I was just goin' on three But I'll bet they never told him How blue and lonesome we'd be.

But friend it hasn't been too long, it wasn't big
I laughed at her and she got mad
The first day that she planted, it was just a twig

And then the first snow came
And she ran out to brush the snow away so it wouldn't die
Came running in all excited
Slipped and almost hurt herself, I laughed till I cried

She was always young at heart
Kinda dumb and kinda smart and I loved her so
And I surprised her with a puppy
Kept me up all Christmas Eve two years ago

And it would sure embarrass her
When I came home from working late 'cause I would know
That she'd been there a crying
Over some sad and silly late, late show

And honey, I miss you
And I'm being good
And I'd love to be with you
If only I could

She wrecked the car and she was sad
So afraid that I'd be mad but what the heck
Though I pretended hard to be
Guess you could say she saw through me and hugged my neck

I came home unexpectedly
Found her crying needlessly in the middle of the day
And it was in the early spring
When flowers bloom and Robins sing, she went away

And honey, I miss you
And I'm being good
And I'd love to be with you
If only I could

Yes, one day while I was not at home
While she was there and all alone the angels came
Now all I have is memories
Of honey and I wake up nights and call her name

And now my life's an empty stage
Where honey lived and honey played and love grew up
A small cloud passes overhead
And cries down on the flower bed that honey loved

Yes, see the tree how big it's grown
But friend it hasn't been too long, it wasn't big
I laughed at her and she got mad
The first day that she planted, it was just a twig

I will cling to the old rugged cross,

J'ai même bu à outrances toute l’absinthe de tes potes 
J'ai côtoyé de rares nymphes, pris des rails en avance 
Dans des salles bien trop noirs sans lueur d’élégance 
D'avantage j'ai serré mes mâchoires lamentables 
Et zélé des amants, des garçons de passage 
Que j'ai tenté d'approcher mais que ma mascarade 
A fait fuir lentement par sa froideur maussade 
Alors j'ai rempli ma panse avec de vives urgences 
Autant vives que ivres sur la piste de danse 
J'ai ajusté mes pansements pour que mes saignements 
Soient beaucoup moins apparents sur la piste d'argent

Glissé ma langue dans des bouches saliveuses 
Dans de tout petits angles où l'on voit qu'les muqueuses, puis là
Je suis rentré bel et bien les mains nues 
Avec cet air déjà vu et l'envie de surplus 
J'ai rien trouvé d'précis excepté d'apparence

Sous prétexte d'être le messie fidèle de ce cher modèle archaïque

T’empeste toujours la fête dans ma cage d'escalier
Ton doux parfum Diesel, oh oui, j'le reconnaîtrais
Parmi toutes ces paillettes que tu laisses s'envoler
Que peut-être même tu perds avec d'autres condamnés
T'inquiète pas, j'te surveille, au combien j't'attendrais
T'es déjà dans mes veines, moi j'te veux dans mes plaies

Pour me protéger de tes crasses, ma merde, ma merde

Promis un jour je saurai le faire, ma mère, ma mère
Te dire ô combien, sans se taire, ma mère, ma mère

Console la peine que tu gardes en toi

Juste de la drogue douce pour calmer l'artifice
Qui paraît des secousses dans un monde sans musique
Voici des calmants lourds pour abaisser les rires
Faut qu'ils retirent sourire, dans ces fêtes sans tabou
Voici d'la musique basse, pour la faire moins festive

Un peu de musique douce, douce

La musique douce en guise d'éclaireur pour pas s'noyer dans nos bains de sueur
Juste d'la drogue douce pour pas être surpris par de géantes touzes de peur et de cris
Des calmants lourds pour jouer l’innocent, un œil en somme toujours prêt à temps
D'la musique basse pour entendre les splash qui cognent en boucle sur les spots intacts

Voilà qu'la lumière coule sur nos visages à larme
Le temps qu'on avale ce sourd moment de rage
Voilà que les cœurs roulent sur les planches colorées
De rouge vif abrupt et de danses desséchées

Ne danse plus à pas de louve
Il y a que ça qui prouve que tu l'ouvres et s'ils veulent nous écarter des pistes
Ces gars-là savent au moins qu'on exige
De danser à pas d'géants
Avec des habits de circonstance
Je l'avoue parfois très outrageant mais ils font peur au point ou d'être agent
Je veux bien les mettre et remettre et crier combien je fais la fête
En montrant bien que sous mes pieds, j'ai la plus belle des cultures dorées
Parfois psyché ou sophistiqué
Je danse fort à me tuer, à coup d'amour et de lettres
Qu'au petit jour, à ces êtres
J'envoie mes sueurs et tous mes baisers pour sereinement aller me coucher

Je me taillerai en or
Je mettrai à ma vue
Que des gens qui m'adorent
Que des gens qui m'dévorent
Que des gens qui m'évoquent
Un beau mois sans effort

Puis j'inscrirais les rues
Mon nom en lettre d'or
Pour oublier les fues
Tintant houle dehors
Un peu moins m'as-tu vu?
N'était qu'un wesh alors
N'était qu'un ouais tu sors

Je rêvais d'être en sueur
Sur des scènes si pures
Ces saines lueurs azures
Pour crier mes peines juste
Pour créer mes rênes sûr
Et puis parfaire mon allure

J'ai donc conçu un plus grand pour oublier le dur
Plus solide que l'fainéant, qui est en moi et qui lutte
Qui est en moi et qui, sûr de soi, bien plus de cran
Que moi devient un géant tout froid

Je d'viendrais fou de moi
Oh, fou comme ça

Si ça continue, je vivrais qu'pour me plaire
Qu'on m'acclame, qu'on me suce
Qu'on l'avale toute entière
Qu'on me dise tout au plus que je n'suis pas qu'un rêve, que je suis encore plus
Je deviendrai accro de celui qui donne l'air
Que tout est bien plus beau quand c'est pas dans ses terres
Quand c'est dans les journaux
Car ma vie est plus terne en dehors des réseaux
Et de mes vues j'en ferais des changements d'humeur
Que je compterais par peur de red'venir inconnnu
De retomber dans le plus
Où j'n'étais pas grand chose, où j'n'étais même jamais vu
Alors je jouerais à l'être même tout le temps balaie
J'nourrirais mon égo de cuillère de paraître
Jusqu'à en perdre la peau, jusqu'à m'en perdre dedans
Jusqu'à faire couler du sang sur les reflets de mon trop grand

S'il n'a pas par malheur
Et un peu par folie, perdu toute sa magie
Perdu tout son meilleur
Perdu tout ce que je suis
J'idolerais l'habit que l'on dit ""de lumière""
Car il prendra ma vie
Et même dans les cratères je le mettrai quand je crie
Pour ne jamais voir les plis, ne jamais voir mes guerres
Ne jamais voir le gris à en avoir le tournis

Me faire croire que les passants pourraient être tous intéressants

D'une phrase ou d'un jeté, de sourires vite interprétés

Souvent je mens pour faire croire à mon dedans
Qu'il vit démesurément et qu'il peut même plaire à plein temps
Avec juste un ou deux baisers que je chope à l'envolée
Je m'imagine des volcans qui inonderaient mes champs de plaies

Mais il s'avère que ce n'est qu'un plan comme d'habitude je me prosterne
Car se griller est indécent surtout devant l'imaginaire

Souvent je mens dans des courses à court de nerf
Ça me donne des jours rêvant d'amour fou et de Minerve
Pour oublier les emmerdes, j'surveille les blogosphères
Tous les détails croustillants qui me mettent encore plus à terre

Souvent je mens pour me donner de l'épaisseur
Comme des centaines de manteaux que j'mets pour faire couler la sueur
Car ici il fait pas chaud et tous ces sauts donnent la chaleur
Avec un tout petit gout de faux qui laisse le tout fade sans saveurs

Souvent je mens pour frétiller en douceur
Me faire bander aisément dans des rêves lourds, et à pas d'heure
Je m'imagine même sans dents, embrasser des jolis cœurs
Qui acceptent bénévolement de se livrer à tous mes leurres

Des prises de positions crasses
Avec des ""je t'aime"" efficaces
Sans les ""je te baise"" à la ramasse

Il me manque ce petit tact
De sûr d'soi pour que ça marche
En attendant je me mets des races
Puis je crois en tout ce qui se passe

J'crois que j'ai pas compris les bases
Pour qu'autant je galère au max
Mais comme Jacques disait des dames
C'est ton pire ennemi qui est en face

Du coup j'fais comme d'hab, je me cache

Eddy Duchin,"I hear music when I look at you,
A beautiful theme of every
Dream I ever knew.
Down deep in my heart I hear it play.
I feel it start, then melt away.

I hear music when I touch your hand,
A beautiful melody
From some enchanted land.
Down deep in my heart, I hear it say,
Is this the day?

I alone have heard this lovely strain,
I alone have heard this glad refrain,
Must it be forever inside of me,
Why can't I let it go,
Why can't I let you know,
Why can't I let you know the song
My heart would sing?

That beautiful rhapsody
Of love and youth and spring,
The music is sweet,
The words are true 
The song is you.",The Song Is You,1990
Eddy Duchin,"When a girl meets boy
Life can be a joy
But the note they end on
Will depend on 
Little pleasures they will share
So let us compare

I like New York in June, how about you?
I like a Gershwin tune, how about you?
I love a fireside when a storm is due.
I like potato chips, moonlight and motor trips,
How about you?
I'm mad about good books, can't get my fill,
And Franklin Roosevelt's looks give me a thrill.
Holding hands at the movie show,
When all the lights are low
May not be new, but I like it,
How about you?

I like Jack Benny's jokes.
To a degree.
I love the common folks.
That includes me.
I like to window shop on 5th Avenue.
I like banana splits, late supper at the Ritz,
How about you?
I love to dream of fame, maybe I'll shine.
I'd love to see your name right beside mine.
I can see we're in harmony,
Looks like we both agree
On what to do,
And I like it, how about you?",How About You?,1990
Eddy Duchin,"It's three o'clock in the morning
We've danced the whole night through
And daylight soon will be dawning
Just one more waltz with you
That melody so entrancing
Seems to be made for us two
I could just keep on dancing forever dear with you
 
There goes the three o'clock chime, chiming, rhyming
My heart keeps beating in time
Sounds like an old sweet love tune
Say that there soon will be a honeymoon
 
It's three o'clock in the morning
We've danced the whole night through
And daylight soon will be dawning
Just one more waltz with you
That melody so entrancing
Seems to be made for us two
 I could just keep on dancing forever dear with you
",Three O'Clock in the Morning,1990
Eddy Duchin,"Did you ever see a dream walking?
Well, I did! 
Did you ever hear a dream talking? 
Well, I did!

Did you ever had a dream thrill you 
With ""Will you be mine?"" 
Oh it's so grand
And it's too, too divine.

Did you ever see a dream dancing? 
Well, I did! 
Did you ever see a dream romancing? 
Well, I did!

Did you ever find heaven right in your arms, 
Saying I love you, I do?
Well, the dream that was walkin' 
And the dream that was talkin' 
And the heaven in my arms was you.",Did You Ever See a Dream Walking,1996
Eddy Duchin,"Blow ill wind, blow away
Let me rest today
You're blowin' me no good, no good

Go ill wind, go away
Skies are oh, so grey
Around my neighborhood, and that's no good

You're only misleadin' the sunshine I'm needin'
Ain't that a shame
It's so hard to keep up with troubles that creep up
From out of nowhere, when love's to blame

So, ill wind, blow away
Let me rest today
You're blowin' me no good, no good

So, ill wind, blow away
Let me rest today
You're blowin' me no good, no good",Ill Wind,1996
Eddy Duchin,"The night is young, the skies are clear 
So if you want to go walking, dear, 
It's delightful, it's delicious, it's de-lovely. 
I understand the reason why 
You're sentimental, 'cause so am I, 
It's delightful, it's delicious, it's de-lovely. 
You can tell at a glance 
What a swell night this is for romance, 
You can hear dear Mother Nature 
Murmuring low, 
""Let yourself go!"" 

So please be sweet, my chickadee, 
And when I kiss you, just say to me, 
""It's delightful, it's delicious, 
It's delectable, it's delirious, 
It's dilemma, it's delimit, it's deluxe, 
It's de-lovely"". 

I feel a sudden urge to sing 
The kind of ditty that invokes the spring. 

I'll control my desire to curse 
While you crucify the verse. 

This verse I started seems to me 
The Tin-Pantithesis of a melody

So spare us all the pain, 
Just skip the darn thing and sing the refrain

Mi, mi, mi, mi, 
Re, re, re, re, 
Do, sol, mi, do, la, si. 

The night is young, the skies are clear 
So if you want to go walking, dear, 
It's delightful, it's delicious, it's de-lovely.

Eddy Duchin,"We were more than lovers,
We were more than sweethearts,
It's so hard to understand.

Don't know why it happened,
Don't know how it started,
Why should we be strangers,
After all we planned.

I can't show my face,
Can't go anyplace,
People stop an' stare,
It's so hard to bear,
Everybody knows you left me,
It's the talk of the town

Every time we meet,
My heart skips a beat,
We don't stop to speak,
'Though it's just a week,
Everybody knows you left me,
It's the talk of the town
 
We send out invitations,
To friends and relations,
Announcing our weddin' day
Friends and our relations,
Gave congratulations,
How can you face them?
What can you say?
 
Let's make up sweetheart,
We can't stay apart,
Don't let foolish pride,
Keep you from my side,
How can love like ours be ended?

One more perfect day is through.

Eddy Duchin,"I cover the waterfront,
I'm watching the sea,,
Will the one I love,
Be coming back to me?

I cover the waterfront,
In search of my love,
And I'm covered by,
A starless sky above.

[Chorus]
Here am I,
Patiently waiting,
Hoping and longing,
Oh! How I yearn!
Where are you?
Are you forgetting?
Do you remember?
Will you return?

I'm watching the sea,
For the one I love,
Must come back to me.

Eddy Duchin,"My love must be a kind of blind love
I can't see anyone but you
Sha bop sha bop

Are the stars out tonight
I don't know if it's cloudy or bright
I only have eyes for you dear

The moon may be high
But I can't see a thing in the sky
I only have eyes for you

I don't know if we're in a garden
Or on a crowded avenue

You are here and so am I
Maybe millions of people go by
But they all disappear from view
And I only have eyes for you",I Only Have Eyes for You,1996
Eddy Duchin,"[He] I won't dance, don't ask me.
I won't dance, don't ask me.
I won't dance, madame, with you.
My heart won't let me do things they should do.
You know what? You're lovely.
[She]And so what? I'm lovely.
[He] But, oh what you do to me.
I'm like an ocean wave that's bumped on the shore;
I feel so absolutely stumped on the floor.
[She]When you dance, you're charming and you're gentle,
'Specially when you do the Continental.
[He] But this feeling isn't purely mental,
For heaven rest us, I'm not asbestos.
And that's why I won't dance, why should I?
I won't dance, how could I?
I won't dance. Merci beaucoup.
I know that music leads the way to romance,
So if I hold you in my arms, I won't dance.",I Won't Dance,1996

Shine on my love and me
So we can stroll beside the roll
Of the rolling sea

Moon over Miami
Shine on as we begin
A dream or two that may come true
When the tide comes in

Hark to the song of the smiling troubadours
Hark to the throbbing guitars
Hear how the waves offer thunderous applause
After each song to the stars

Moon over Miami
You know we're waiting for
A little love, a little kiss
On Miami shore",Moon over Miami,1996
Eddy Duchin,"Live was as calm as a summer sea
When silver moonlight beams
And then a new love beckoned me
Wrecking the ship of my dreams
 
Riptide caught in a riptide, torn between two loves
The old and the new
Riptide lost in a riptide
Where will it take me what shall I do?
My heart is tossed on a sea of emotion
One love offers romance
The other devotion
A new love is calling
The old love is pleading

Swinging in a blossom laden tree
But tell me bluebird
Will there be happiness for me?

Will I discover Someone to care for me?
A perfect lover to hold me tenderly?
Will someone ever sing me A love song while we dance?
Will the music bring me romance?

Will there be someone Whenever skies are gray
To kiss my lonely tears away?
And will that someone be all I dreamed my love would be
Someone to care for me?

Eddy Duchin,"You're just too marvelous, too marvelous for words
Like glorious, glamorous and that old standby amorous
It's all too wonderful, I'll never find the words
That say enough, tell enough, I mean they just aren't swell enough
