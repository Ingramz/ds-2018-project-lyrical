John Legend,"You know you ghetto boy, when you got a face, with a scar
And yo' highest aspirations is a place, and a car
Shorties pull out and bust, like a money shot
Now he on the run, he hot
And he hurtin' his Granny and she the only one he got
The hood so shady
You give up hope, of ever even tryin' to find a sunny, 
Spot-light, they caught him at the 
Stop-light, but if he woulda run that yellow
Then he coulda, run the globe
But instead, with speed
They put one in the middle of his frontal, lobe
Like a unicorn
I'm just tryin' to keep you, informed
To my little ghetto soldiers in they, gold
Green, red, and blue uni-forms, chuuch!
But I'm feeling like the loneliest monk
So I pull me a Thelonius Monk and blew, the horn
And we don the monikers of goons and gangsters
And are trained to conduct ourselves true, to form
So we add a Shorty, a Money, a Mack
A Lil', a Eazy, or a Young to our name
So all the big ballers grab rims and hung, in the game
And there's a degree, of difficulty
To make it from the ghetto boy into the man-hood
Especially when you know that yo' fresh greens
Will help eliminated a canned, good
Can, good, and bad co-exist?
In a place with plenty of off ramps but no exits",Little Ghetto Boy (Prelude),2010
John Legend,"Hope of the world is in our generation 
(lets straighten it out)
It's all left up to us to change this present situation 
(lets straighten it out)
Take caution from our elders, don't make the same mistake 
(lets straighten it out)
Let's fill the world with love, and get rid of all the hate

Our elders taught us one thing but, practice another 
Just look at what happened to the Indian and the brother

If they want people killed, let them fight the war

It's gotta end somewhere, this killing's got to cease

It's why we're together and stronger 
Than they ever thought it could be
A world motherless, can health care cover this? 
A love for all people no matter what the culture is 
Our generation, is makin' huge strides 
A self-empowering movement that's on the rise 
The more the door is open, the more the youth can see 
A fair chance means a greater opportunity 
To have a brighter future, deeper insight 
Work hard to be anything you want in life 
It's what it's all about, the longevity 
Educated enough to know what's ahead of me 
Need to straighten it out, seek and you'll find 
They can cage your body, but not your mind 
We lay it all on the line in the struggle 
We grew, but together here's what we gotta do

John Legend,"They wait to plead their case, unknown cast aside.
I love to see their face, can we spare the light?
Are we afraid to see the prisoners of history?
These beautiful minds, trapped inside.
Bring them back to life.

Let 'em shine.
Let 'em shine on.
Let 'em shine.
Let 'em shine on.

So dark, but I see sparks, if we don't snuff them out.
We gotta light them flame, let them speak their name.
Let them reach up to the clouds.
Can't eat if we don't feed them.
Can't read if we don't teach them.
There's no line if we just hide them.
Don't just let 'em die.

Let 'em shine.
Let 'em shine on.
Let 'em shine.
Let 'em shine on.
Let 'em shine.
Let 'em shine on.

Oh stars flicker in the distance, lonely out in space.
They sing out when we're not listening, because we don't see their face.
We can let them die, we can make them high.
Hold the little miracles that live inside.
Let 'em shine.

Let 'em shine.
Let 'em shine on.
Let 'em live.
Let 'em shine on.
Let 'em read on.
Let 'em shine on.
Let 'em grow.
Let 'em shine on.
Come on, let them love.
Come on, let them love.
Come on, let them love.
Yeah. 
Yeah (let them love)

Hold them close, let them know they'll get through the night
Ordinary people could be a hero, don't blow out the light.
Let 'em shine.
Let 'em shine on.
Let 'em shine.

John Legend,"Wake up everybody no more sleepin' in bed
No more backward thinkin' time for thinkin' ahead
The world has changed so very much
From what it used to be
There is so much hatred war and poverty
Oh yeah

Wake up all the teachers time to teach a new way
Maybe then they'll listen to whatcha have to say
Cause they're the ones who's coming up 
And the world is in their hands
When you teach the children 
Teach 'em the very best you can
Oh yeah

[Chorus]
The world won't get no better 
If we just let it be
The world won't get no better 
We gotta change it yeah, 
Just you and me.

Wake up all the doctors make the ol' people well
They're the ones who suffer an' who catch all the hell
But they don't have so very long before the Judgment Day
So won'tcha make them happy before they pass away.

Wake up all the builders time to build a new land
I know we can do it if we all lend a hand
The only thing we have to do is put it in our minds
Surely things will work out cause they do every time.

The world won't get no better 
If we just let it be
The world won't get no better 
We gotta change it yeah, 
Just you and me.

Yeah, yeah

It's the God hour
The morning I wake up
Just for the breath of life I thank my maker
My mom say I come from hustlers and shakers
My mom buidin' on skyscrapers and acres
He said take us back to where we belong
I try to write a song
As sweet as the Psalms
Though I'm the type to bare arms
And wear my heart on my sleeve
Even when I fell in God I believe
Read the days that weave through the maze
The seasons so amazing
Feed them and raised them
Seasons are aging
Earthquakes, wars, and rumors
I want us to get by but
We're more than consumers
We more than shooters, more than looters
Created in this image so God live through us
And even in this generation, living through computers
Only love love love can reboot us

Wake up everybody no more sleepin' in bed
Wake up, everybody
Need a little help,
Can't do it alone
Need a little help y'all
C'mon c'mon c'mon c'mon
Need a little help, y'all 
Can't do it alone
Need a little help, y'all 
Can't do it alone

I'm awoken by a cold shiver
Wind blows change, change
Sweet rushing through my veins

No, I just might die
Overtaken by the high tide
Feel the rain against my skin
Drown my soul in the water again

Move on me
Move on me
Move on me

Shake, shake, should have learned
Get that close and you might get burned
Sweet heat and the sweet lies
So betrayed by the look in your eyes

That look I know so well
It's a heaven with a taste of hell
On your lips and down within
Drown my soul, baby let it begin

Move on me
Move on me
Move on me

Give me two hands I can hold
I'll tell you things I've never told

John Legend,"And I can see it with my eyes closed, now
Feeling like my life froze
I'm about to hit the ground

Sippin' yak while I elevate my mind state
Hand by the burner in case a near try to violate
Never go down, stay rising like Andre
'Cause my corner back every thing the Don say
Long Beach, yeah I yell it out in every song
Err'y day, err'y night till I'm carried home
Forever known, big ballin', try it in the city
Then yelling out swish way before it in the net

And I ain't knockin' niggas hustle, it's all a game
And when they mention the best, will they call your name?
There's only winners and losers, ain't no in betweens
We either hit the hall of fame or you fall to shame
And you ain't got to wonder where my place at
Pepsi blue rags sorta poppin', bitch taste that
One hit of the bong will blow ya face back
LMFAO to the bank, boy, ASAP

And I can see it with my eyes closed, now
Feeling like my life froze
I'm about to hit the ground

I do it 'cause I feel it
Live it like I'm talkin'
Flow so straight but won't a nigga try and walk it 
I'm so high, yeah the weed, I'm still sparking it
My bitch bad and my diamonds still sparkling
Got the competition shaking like Parkinsons
Breads in the bag, call it good marketin'
Life's a bitch but I don't caught again
That's what a word to the third letter

Shot, shot, shots to me and my cheddar
Run these emcee's I'm tougher than leather
Vietnamese eyes tighter than ever
Fuck with the Dogg I'm biting whomever
'Cause I didn't came from a long path
Only God knows how long left the Dogg has
'Cause like time we all pass
So if you ever taste success, just pray it's from a tall glass

And I can see it with my eyes closed, now
Feeling like my life froze
I'm about to hit the ground

I sold my soul to the devil that's a crappy deal
Least it came with a few toys like a happy meal
This game you could never win
'Cause they love you then they hate you then they love you again
Get away from me misery
Get away from me loneliness
Get away from me fake bitches, I can't take the phoniness
Get away from me whack tracks

I can only make only hits
I'm an only child lost in the world
Where did the lonely kids go when the bell rings
Its feeling like hell rings
It's bringing me back down
He's checking my background
It's ironic whats happening
Imagine if I didn't have the ends
I wouldn't have so many imaginary friends

I'm spaced out dog, I be on that moon talk
Wonder if God ask Mike how to moon walk
I swear to momma wish me and my father talk more
I stopped visiting around the time I was a sophomore
I guess everything I hate about me I see in him
And we ain't finna change, so we won't agree again
Till then I'll be pouring out my soul
Just a few things I see with my eyes closed

And I can see it with my eyes closed, now
Feeling like my life froze
I'm about to hit the ground

See you with my eyes closed",Eyez Closed,2011
John Legend,"When the universe connects us
I know this is karma

Stare at the sky, can't get out my bed
There's shadow's circling my head
Where's love, your love
In another life id i play this game
Leaving me alone with an empty frame
I fear the worst in me
But you know the best in me
'Cause you see, when I'm honest with honesty
I will stumble trough the darkness
Til we see the morning

Is this karma, can you hear me
My heart is singin'
Everything inside i wanna say
I think about you every single day
Is this karma, Come and dance
Like we did before i
Lost you, this is karma
My heart is singing
Everything inside i wanna say
Every step I'm taking day by day
When the universe connects us
I know this is karma

I can't get the image of you out of my mind
The edges of your body pushing up against mine
Breathing, breathing
There is a silence in my beating heart
A cause and effect that we can't discard
Is all of love a ploy, an energy decoy
'Cause you see, when I'm honest with honesty
That means crashing trough the mirror
Just to know what love is

Is this karma, Come and dance
Like we did before I
Lost you, this is karma
My heart is singing
Everything inside I wanna say
Every step I'm taking day by day
When the universe connects us
I know this is karma",Karma,2011
John Legend,"Real shit

Sometimes I dream bigger than I live
Sometimes I think better when I'm lit
So goin' and light it
Roll it up, ignite it
One time for all my niggas that dreamed it than real life'd it
I swear I've been through everything in life but a coffin
They saying sky's the limit, how bitch? I'm moon walking
And my middle name Michael ho
Success is my idol and being broke is my rival
But it's cool because I got the title ho
See I just want my fantasies in real life
You got everything tell me what it feel like
Muthafuck the radio if I can't hear mine
They give the wrong people more airtime than airlines
Is you feeling me?
If not you feel my energy
See I know I'ma make it, but even if I don't
Don't feel bad 'cause honestly all the times that I had
Those will be the best memories

Let's reminisce
(Be the best memories)
Over the good times and the bad
(I hope that you remember me)
Reflect on everything we missed
Cause you know we'll never get it back
(These will be the best memories)
Whoa the memories,
Whoa the memories

Are you willing to give up what you love, for who you love
Or lose your girlfriend to groupie love
Everywhere I go I get a group of hugs
That's what happens when they need connections and you to plug
How many trends you gotta set before you considered great
How many missed calls before you considered fake
How many dreams before its considered fate
I'm eating in a world where I'm considered bait
A workaholic addicted to bills
People addicted to me 'cause they addicted to real
My best friend got addicted to pills
I can't look at him in his eyes,
You don't know how that shit feels mentally!
I ain't trying to rock no shirts that say ""in memory""
I'm praying that he make it, wishing we could go back
'Cause honestly all the times that we had
Those be the best memories

Let's reminisce
(Be the best memories)
Over the good times and the bad
(I hope that you remember me)
Reflect on everything we missed
Cause you know we'll never get it back
(These will be the best memories)
Whoa the memories,
Whoa the memories

Sometimes reality checks are too big to be cashed
Was mailed one when I heard Nique had died in that crash
Seemed like yesterday I just seen him smile and laugh
I'm stressing over little shit
When I should be happy I can
They say my music beating, 'cause I follow my heart
I always have faith, like who swallows the darts
And with my Mama looking at cribs that we can't purchase
Houses bigger than a palace
But she a queen, so she deserve it
So I'm focused, they try to throw me off track
But they just hurdles
I'm marathoning to the money and you just running off in a circle
Man, I'm huddled up with my team, in other words my inner circle
Fast forward a few years later
Now we the fucking winner's circle
Remember the first time I was rhyming for Kan'
Almost as nervous as the first time I rhymed for my mom
Sold out the theater downtown, she said it was perfect
But I already dreamed it
So it felt like I rehearsed it
Much as my grandma took care of me since I was birthed
Sad I used to steal twenty dollar bill right out her purses
No I ain't perfect, tryna make a gift out of a curse
Life out of a hearse
And if I die first, I have the memories

Let's reminisce
(Be the best memories)
Over the good times and the bad
(I hope that you remember me)
Reflect on everything we missed
Cause you know we'll never get it back
Whoa the memories
Whoa the memories

Let's reminisce
On the good times and the bad
Reflect on everything we missed
Cause you know we'll never get it back
Whoa the memories
Whoa the memories yeah","Memories, Pt. 2",2011

I'll never forget you
I'll never let you go
I'll never forget you
I'll always remember, I hope you know

Let the record reflect the records we set
Best foot forward with every step
And let's push towards it, never regress
And let's remember, if ever we get
Down, the places that we came from 'round
And all the good times on the bad side of town
The upside of bad, flip it upside down
Came from the bottom but we up high now
Believe, and from this view we achieved
We looked back at the rules we received
And how we broke those, dismantled and rewrote those
And the ghost still alive in the photos
Sounds of the summer, day and go wise
Cold wind blowin' through a city on fire
Moments of the past, came here to find you
Not to relive them, just to remind you

It's never been more, not like tonight
We walk into the glow, right into the light
The past all around us, the time of our life
The first love kisses, the broke heart disses
This is just like a first-class ticket
Back, to the first written rap
The crumbled-up paper and the pen with no cap
The hand-me-down clothes and the unturned hat
The hookers on the corner and the kids sellin' crack
The needles in the yard where we used to play catch
Stories from the project we could never go at
Or to, these are shades of my youth
Trials of a child, everything truth
Moments of the past, comin' back to find us
Not to relive them, just to remind us

Everything cherished, remembered in my heart
So you will never perish, you will never part
I tell 'em all about you, drummin' in the park
We put you in the ground, but I see you in the stars
Gon', take a bow, a round of applause
The best that ever, always ready we are
Love always shines, that's how I'll find you
In case you forgot, I hope this reminds you now

John Legend,"I believe in the light that shines and will never die
Oh I believe the fire burns, we stay alive
They will talk about us
Like they talked about the kings before us
They will talk about us

These are the words of a believer
Achiever, leader of the globe
Feeding souls of those in need
I bleed the blood of the struggle
Walking over troubled puddles
Hustles in my chest, no hustle no progress
Extremities of life and it's process
Birth of a son, death of another
With love I can rest both mothers
And told ‘em, who’s in control is the one thats above us
I walk where money talks and love stutters
Body language of a nation going through changes
The young become dangerous, pain gets spent into anger
Anger gets sent through the chamber
It’s tough when your own look like strangers
We are the sons of gangsters and stone rangers
If he could how would Ernie Barnes paint us?
Look at the picture, hard not to blame us
But time forgives in the Chi where the young die often
Do they end up in a coffin because we haven’t taught them?
Is it what we talking we really ain't walking?
Dudes, hustlers pay, how much did it cost ‘em?
Find myself on the same corner that we lost ‘em
Real talking, in they ear like a walkman
Thoughts spin around the corner to the world
When I see them, I see my baby girl
Believe!

I believe in the light that shines and will never die
Oh I believe the fire burns, we stay alive
They will talk about us
Like they talked about the kings before us
They will talk about us

The lord lives among us
The young uns hunger become a means to get it
By any ways necessary, under pressure
Children feeling lesser, with the steel up on the dresser
Killin' will aggressors, destiny’s children
Survivors, soldiers, in front of buildings they eyes look older
Hard to see blessings in the violent culture
Face against weapons, sirens, holsters
That ain't the way that Langston Hughes wrote us
Soul controllers on the shoulders of Moses and Noah
We go from being Precious to Oprah
Cultivated to overcome ever since we came overseas
Today and the way that you can see we determined
Solar keeps burning, shawty’s know to keep learning
Lesson’s in our life, but life stripes that we earning
Took gramps' advice that Christ is returning
Like a thief in the night, I write the beacons of light
For those of us in dark alleys and parched valleys
Street kids spark rallies of the conscience conquerors of a contest
That seems beyond us, even through the unseen
I know that God watches
From one King's dream, he was able to Barack us
The prophets, nothing can stop us
Believe!

Oh I believe the fire burns, we stay alive

When Christmas comes
When Christmas comes

But baby if you spread love
Someday it might be enough to heal each other one by one

And we gon' get together
And rejoice and pray
And we gon' help the world, become a better place
And we gon' sing and shout
Because the savior reigns
So don't dismay

Because this Christmas time
Get together
It's gonna be so nice
Better than ever
Because this gift of love lasts forever
The Lord makes our hearts open up
Soon as Christmas comes

It's gon' be alright
When Christmas comes
Oh jingle all the way
Oh what fun, hmm

And we gon' reminisce about the good old days
And we gon' laugh together as the children play
And through the years is always gonna be this way
Come what may

Because this Christmas time
Get together
It's gonna be so nice
Better than ever
And baby you're the one that I treasure
I can't wait to unwrap your love

John Legend,"My ghetto dreams always turn to ghetto nightmares

At night I can't sleep, I toss and turn
Candlesticks in the dark, I was whippin' the hard
I was gettin' the broads that like ""who the hell is that""
I was dealing sacks, you looking at niggas that drove to hell and back. 
Charismatic I was raised by a addict with money in the attic. 
Got goons while you at it at 
This present time I'm out of my mind and that's a habit, 
Still got them waiting in line they gotta have

Last night was the first night I got sleep
Tossing and turning for two or three weeks
My nightmares are triggered by bad memories
Lord, send me an angel right now while I'm having ghetto dreams

Cold sweats listenin' to the old sweat
One, two that's a ho check
Now for real, nigga this a whole check
Just bossin' around, polo sweats
Used to dream 'bout a bigger couch
Woke up in a bigger house, come on
Commas in my bank account
So much money I had to let the banker count

Last night was the first night I got sleep
Tossing and turning for two or three weeks
My nightmares are triggered by bad memories
Lord, send me an angel right now while I'm having ghetto dreams

It's like the world stand still
Yesterday your little man got killed
And all he ever wanted was a bank roll
But he died too young 'cause the game's cold
Most niggas ain't know, or they just think slow
Once you get in you gotta leave but you can't though
Does freedom make a motherfucker evil
To the point down your ass when he see you
Let's take that needle, fill it with poison
Inject the ghetto with the drug, paranoia
Got you lookin' at your homeboy sideways
Ain't no honor among thieves is there nowadays
They tell me crime pays, but I don't think so
Because every criminal I know is in the clink, yo
A nigga in the game right now
Must be working for them people cause that shit played out

My judgement’s divine, I'll tell you who you can call,

Who did that to you,
Gotta find that fool who did that to you.

Now I don’t take pleasure in a man’s pain,

John Legend,"Look how far we came
Through the fire, I stood knowing we would reign
Feels like yesterday when all this was a dream
Through these Maybach curtains I see how life has changed

I think Ima dedicate this one
To all the people that thought I wouldn't make it here
Dream chasers

Yeah, it was all a dream
On the corner servin' all them fiends
Me and a bunch of my niggas, yeah, we was all a team
The system labeled us killas, but momma called us kings
Walked through the hall of a prison, now it's the hall of fame
And people got the nerve to ask why I wear all these chains
When I was booked, they had me shackled to the wall of shame
So I'm just representin', better yet just reminiscin'

Put down on that Bentley truck, I used to want the Expedition
Now it's bigger things, grew up and got bigger dreams
Cause in my hood, niggas try to smoke you just like nicotine
And this money shit ain't funny, all the shit it brings
You bound to lose your family and your friends, boy this shit is mean
And birthdays was the worst days
Last week I made a hundred on a Thursday
And Club Liv got me sinnin' on a church day
Stevie J all on the mic, he screamin' out my birthplace
Philly, we back!

Look how far explain we came
Through the fire, I stood knowing we would reign
Feels like yesterday when all this was a dream
Through these Maybach curtains I see how life has changed

I'm blunted, you wanna see life's meaning?
On the radio, Al Green, while Mom's cleanin'
Mom's singing along with the songs
And shortly I learned the words to 'em
Nerf balls, I threw 'em
But now I'm a perfectionist to a fault like Jesus
Judgin' his own miracles, but he won't cause he automatic
I'm like an old blues singer living in the bottle
Whose wife left him down in the bottom
Writing songs is how we solvin' the problem
My liquid money's a hypnotist to your Mrs

Lay back like I'm in the chair of a dentist
Nasir relentless, a freak like Prince is
Mystique like Sade
Soon as I enter people, point and see my anointment
I ain't tryna do too much
Same time, I ain't no bum nigga not doin' enough
But I ain't tryna do no dumb shit, chasin' my tail in a circle
I made it so I'm chillin' now
Transparent ceiling now


Look how far explain we came
Through the fire, I stood knowing we would reign
Feels like yesterday when all this was a dream
Through these Maybach curtains I see how life has changed

The chorus cinematic, going back to Cali
Young street nigga, late 80's suede Bally's
Jewels like Rick the Ruler, looking like I ripped the jeweler
I could cut a check, make some people hit your shooter
Domino effect, you in that magic city
Where all they do is flex; call it Milli Vanilli
Coming from the bottom, my lil' nigga from Philly
Young legend outta Queens, take over city to city
Honor thou mother, go to war for my brother
Giving sufficient funds to significant others
Went from poor now women screamin' for my signature
More war came from the bottom so I know the war
Never worn, always on, y'all niggas luke warm
Talking cash over salads, heavy croûtons
Cuban Linx's equivalent to having suits on
Stretch Maybachs 'til they bring the coupes on

Look how far explain we came
Through the fire, I stood knowing we would reign

John Legend,"Ooh baby, the day you stepped into my world
You noticed I'm the kind of girl who loves her diamonds and white pearls
So tempt me to jet set away in London
To sip on some tea, you surprise me with gifts from Tiffany
Ooh (La la la la la la la la)
I love the way we livin' boy
But my daddy say, ""You don't need that boy""
So let's run away, let's run away (way, way)
Momma say I'm too young for love
And lovin' you is all I'm thinkin' of
My heart tells me that you're the one
It's the feeling you give, it is

Pure bliss
Like you've got the key to my heart
Simple as a touch and a kiss
Never knew a feeling like this
Pure bliss, pure bliss
Nobody can tear us apart
Baby it's as good as it gets (Kiss kiss kiss kiss)
Loving you will never be hard
This is pure bliss

I remember, when the pilot closed the door
Said it's time for lift off, you said, ""What'd you choose me for?""
Don't ever wonder
'Cause you deserve the best
Once you reach the top you'll never question why you left
My world is yours
What you waitin' for?
Let's run away
Let's run away

But we can't listen baby

John Legend,"10 a.m. it's west side bitch
She see the glasses, so obvious
Run from home, after tonight we up out of here
Don't go home 'cause they just ran me up out of there
All of those drunken nights then fuckin' every night
She run her mouth, but can't eat right
Don't read between the line and figure out how to be white
She smelled the line, baby you know you don't need white
Now look what we did now, the cops behind us
Ran that red light, did you have to be mindless? SMH,
We all know that cocaine killed Abel
From the scholar letters devour this
She stepped into hell, 'cause winter got cold
Don't look in her eyes, you might see straight to her soul
Don't say yes to that good, cause you'll never know
'Cause we lost in the city where sin is no biggy

I'm here with open arms and I got her
Here is where her heart belongs, her heart belongs with me
Here is where her heart
I'm here and I won't go without her
This is where her heart belongs it should be here with me
Here is where her heart

I beg for mercy today
They won't take me away
Take me away from you
Don't know what I would do
Don't let us die in vain
Don't let them see our pain
Wash these demons away
Wash these demons away

You are all unwelcome to Sin City
Yet the population still increases its density
And that increases its intensity
Which increases the propensity
To complicate your simplicity
No matter your ethnicity
All for the sake of publicity, in this city

Huh, bad bitches with ass shots
Use a house as a stash spot
Lexus coupe with the rag-top
I'm in the loop, warm tie like a ascot
I used to run with the have-nots
Kept the ave' hot just so we could have knots
A lot of niggas see they dreams in a glass pot
Until the judge throw you in that box and watch your ass rot
We broke all the commandments
Authentic, I'm hand-stitched
Come spend a day in my Hamlet
My city lost, some say it's Atlantis
I went to Cannes with a tan bitch, Francis
She rode the broom on the beach, that's a sand witch
So I ate her like it, haters hate to like it
Sex, drugs, and playin' dices, those are our favorite vices
But this life'll take a toll on ya
Well I guess you gotta pay the prices
I know who Christ is
And he never hung with the Saints it makes no sense to save the righteous
By the age ten, we were caged in
Now they raise men in the state pen
Fake friends, forgive 'em for they sins
God bless the city, amen

I'm here with open arms and I got her
Here is where her heart belongs her heart belongs with me
Here is where her heart
I'm here and I won't go without her
This is where her heart belongs it should be here with me

And now I'm one of the residents
They walk with none of the repercuss', but all of the decadence
And all the fuckin' debauchery
Adult film star, somebody's fuckin' watchin' me
I always feel like, I'm almost Phil like
'Cause I could feel it in the air tonight
I did some wrongs I wouldn't dare to right
And wrote some songs I wouldn't dare recite
But I am willing to share tonight
In the city that is as unfair as life",Sin City,2012
John Legend,"Regardless of how it goes down
Life goes on
Am I right?

On the way we shed some tears
Every day we sacrifice
So we can be standing here
Oh what a hell of a life
Been winning so many years
And the future is bright
Now it's very clear
That we gon' be rich forever, and ever, and ever
We gon' be rich forever
We gon' be rich forever, and ever, and ever

I remember being blind to it
'Til the day I put my mind to it
Pen and pad on the dresser for me to fine tune it
I sat in the corner, made up my mind, do it
Def Jam on my heels, should I sign to it?
Million dollar advance for me to rhyme fluent
Every day I'm hustlin' on every corner boomin'
Back of the phantom couldn't fathom I was such a student
Grandfather deal for the Godfather
Lucian Grainge from the ghetto, I follow God's orders
And he told me I was rich forever
And he showed me I was rich forever
They call me Mr. Roberts when I'm in the bank
Digits like the Dodgers when it come to franks
Flossin' out in Compton like I got a cape
RoseMo tried to fight it, but barely niggas fade
White sheet, yellow tape, where your dogs at
Count a million cash, can you blog that?
Me and niggas your type never exchange numbers
Want to conversate and steal game from us
See the watch, now you want to know the name of it
Never playin' so I went and got the frame flooded
Cartier, Hublot, I could name a dozen
Your shit pushed back cuz it ain't buzzin'
Now these thugs actors all of a sudden
Niggas hustle backwards all of a sudden
Can't talk snow, where the soft at
Your man got murked, but you squashed that
Hope you know what we call that
I think you know just what we call that
All you pussy boys fall back
Big face Rollie, rose gold cost 40
Platinum twenty-one, it's time to go and spoil shorty
You only live once I'm screaming YOLO in the VI
Time flies fast balling with my nigga T.I
Ciroc, no glass, smiling women in my presence
Tall supermodels always fall in my possession
Atlanta housewives taking pictures in my section
But I only got a thing for young bitches with aggression
Show me that affection that a D-Boy craves
Rich forever in my D-Boy ways
So dope, blue jeans, new J's
Sold dope by any means all day

Been winning so many years
And the future is bright
Now it's very clear
That we gon' be rich forever, and ever, and ever
We gon' be rich forever

100 mil ain't enough
Got 100 women, gotta deal with it, love
Worth 40 m's is he still dealing drugs
Cigarette speedboats, but he's still with the thugs
Club Liv, Louis shots on a Sunday
Grinding, even be legit one day
Order some more bottles because I'm on one
I know her pussy wet, and she wanna cum
She wanna cum, maybe come over
Stop dealing with them niggas you need one soldier
Keep you as my bitch forever
'Cause you know a nigga rich forever

Been winning so many years
And the future is bright

Gotta be careful who you trusting
Be aware of your surrounding when you hustling

You fuck with dude, he your day one
Almost had it all then the day comes
When they walking through your house with the strap out
Pointing at your head, got the bread then you black out (yeah)
Bright lights down the hallways
Left his best friend for dead for the small wage (ay)
They say that every dogs got a day coming
It's like he seen a ghost but he ain't say nothing
Eyes wide shut like you looking at me
Window pain to the soul say they niggas happy
But the pictures ain't say them words and we dry stomach
The homie didn't keep it one hundred
The cops doing roundups, say they got a suspect
Finally got a name now, I'm still thinkin fuck that (fuck, that)
For money, niggas murder what they close to (get this nigga)
Entire families these mother fuckin' ghost you
Smoke you, was it worth what the life was?
Just prepared for the payback because it strikes cuz
Was it worth what that life was?
Prepare for the payback when it strikes cuz

Cuz when you need it the most ain't no one ever around

Yo, the pain's unbearable, remains unaware-able
He fuck around jump off a building if you dare him to
The greats they done already killed him, who you compare him to
Figure out what he said will take a year or two
Family over everything, skills over politics
He don't need the accolades as long as you acknowledge it
Just playing the hand you was dealt, no aces
Betrayal is worse than death in most cases

Your man that you grew up with get you indicted
This was your nigga, yo, for him you let the trigger go

You know when it's someone you love the hurt's pure
You front tryna hold it in, it hurts more
He was right there back-to-back with me, my first war
Even had a crack spot together, the first floor
Used to buzz em in then meet him right by the first door
That was 'prolly a year before I went on my first tour
Friendship was worth more than a couple of ounces
He was 'sposed to be with me arguing with the bouncers
Instead you ended up somewhere far in the mountains
Talking 'about what we was doing, what we was counting
Nothing but old pictures of old sixes
Old BM's with the kids, old snitches
Two sides, both wishes
Karma is the sister of life, they both bitches

There's a story in my pain
There's a story in my tears, oh-oh oh

Lord forgive me for my sins, I was chasin' ends
And I'm into makin' money, I ain't in to making friends
Cause these niggas rattin', I ain't finna take a chance
Homie said he 'bout that action they grabbin' me take the stand, damn
Say loyalty make a man, got a homie and he told
I don't even shake his hand, I don't even crack a smile
Knew him since a child, man this game so foul
But niggas made vows to a code I never break
Ridin' in the heavy weight
Thirty-six O's in the bird, call it feather weight
Never on time, when I show up I be ready late
Niggas got fat while we starved they already ate
And I'm trying to get full, masks on clips full
If he got the money we attack him like a pitbull
We sellin' soft, we sellin' hard like it's a brick store
On my dick, nigga, thought that's what your bitch for
Hah!

My pain ain't never been told (ain't never been told)
All the success that I'm suffering from
Came from this knowledge I sold (this knowledge I sold)

Yeah
I could go anywhere but still choose you again
I can't miss another day

There's a million reasons
A million ways
A million words
But I've said all I can say
There's only one thing I want out of all I could do
Out of a billion places
I only wanna be with you
Just wanna be your lover
Wanna be your lover, wanna be your love tonight

John Legend,"Yeah, I used to care so much what people thought about me
Now I really could give a fuck
Now when I own over 15 million in real estate
And bought all The Fast & Furious trucks
See, everyday I put in work and my salary grows
So excuse me I'm not caught up on reality shows
See the reasons family values on the south side
I live in Atlanta but do not have an Atlanta's house, why?

I'm not married, I've never been engaged
But your dumbass believes whatever's on the front page
See some of these bloggers don't even believe their own lies
Turn the computer screen into a mirror, look at your own lives
'Cause technology exceeds all humanity
But there's a thin line between genius and insanity
Now private pics on my private, no longer private, man
Hope I can gets some privacy up on my private plane

Oh, living in the spotlight
Oh if it's too hot, too hot tonight
I think I'm gonna take flight
But I'ma be alright, I'ma be alright
Let me live 'til I die

I'm doing interviews
Getting asked the same questions from 10 years ago
Wondering to myself what the fuck I'm there for
(What am I here for?)
Now that my daughter's a CEO at the age of 10
And I got restaurants inside Atlanta's airport
That repetition will drive any human being nutty
I'd rather be in my own crib, on my own couch
Thinking I got that ""do what the fuck I wanna do money""
Yeah, and then I went to Quincy Jones' house
Realize I didn't have shit, got some work to do
Soon as you get some money
Is gon' be someone with more than you
Sci-fi movies, the fans said this album is overdue
And if you don't put some music out
These niggas gon' be over you
Talking about where that old Luda, for the rapper's sake
But Usher told me if I don't evolve I'll evaporate
I've gotten better, motherfucker if you listen
If you're smart, and went to college better use your intuition

Oh, living in the spotlight
Oh, if it's too hot, too hot tonight
I think I'm gonna take flight
But I'ma be alright, I'ma be alright
Let me live 'til I die

Yeah, my own expectations I exceeded them
And when people say Luda's underrated, I'd agree with 'em
They said I'm so visual they overlook the lyrics
But every verse you get a sample if your mind can clear it
Then steer it in the direction of your memory
And I'll be satisfied when I'm celebrated for centuries
Wrote a song for my girl she couldn't stand straight
My man said, ""don't release it, you'll ruin your female fan base""
I said, ""man, my female fan base gon' be here forever""
'Cause even though I'm with one, to them we're still together
And who am I to tell 'em different if my voice can freak 'em
Long as I can continue coming through all of that speakers
I'm a man of choice words but I speak the truth
And I ain't scared of shit except God and a life jail suit
Especially when all of my bills are paid for
And God answer everything that I pray for

Oh, living in the spotlight
Oh, if it's too hot, too hot tonight
I think I'm gonna take flight
But I'ma be alright, I'ma be alright
Let me live 'til I die

Oh, living in the spotlight
Oh, if it's too hot, too hot tonight
I think I'm gonna take flight

That one day I will be, where I was
Right there, right next to you

No words can explain, the way I'm missing you
Deny this emptiness, this hole that I'm inside
These tears, they tell their own story

You told me not to cry when you were gone
But the feeling's overwhelming
They're much too strong
Can I lay by your side, next to you, you
And make sure you're alright
I'll take care of you
And I don't want to be here

You had a love, and I had mine 
But I still wanted to know you 

Well baby we're alone right now 
Released from all the ties that bound us 
Saw you again in the crowd
I was looking for you and finally found ya

Give me our first kiss 

Cos' I am here and the time is right 
Baby you're the only thing on my mind 
Are you ready? tell me that you're ready? 
The moon is high and the lights are low 
The fire's inside we should let it glow 
(the fear inside you should let it go)

Why why not 
Tonight? 

I make a move you make a move too
I like the way that u played it 
I'll learn your body 
You'll teach me how too

There's no place I'd rather be

Drawing me in, and you kicking me out
You've got my head spinning, no kidding, I can’t pin you down

I’m on your magical mystery ride
And I’m so dizzy, don’t know what hit me, but I’ll be alright

My head’s under water
But I’m breathing fine

Loves all of you

Don't you wish everything could be so perfect? 

Free Enterprise, overexposed
Irritated, uneducated still scribble my flows
The jubilation, the euphoria
Pushing a foreign in the morning
Pick your daughter up
Drop your seed off, let the weed up
Slow motion, fast forward 'til we speed up
Grinding 'til my new accountant is fully at ease
Beefing with broke niggas really like pulling my teeth
Get away from me, you looking so suspicious
Light pocket, heavy hearted, you simple minded niggas
Don't be jealous of me, I keep enough foes
Get all the sneakers, not enough clothes
You can have the ex, I got enough hoes
You can have my next, once we a month old
Reptile black, Birkin Bamboo handle
Now the trophy on the mantle, well I got a Phantom
Being down and out was inconceivable
When you find out the one you love is just misleading you
Tryna make a living, remain spiritual
Egotistical ways I embraced back in middle school
If the chick was game, we would run a train
Send her home on a bus, then forget her name
But now the bitches be the realest ones
I done cried on the shoulder when I'm feeling numb
Seen a man getting life and never shed a tear
But his daughter in the ninth never pierced her ears
Time will come when all that nice shit disappears
Why you think I'm on the night shift with the pills? 
Mind frame of that boy that was found slain
Mouth slang you can tell I been around 'cane
Double R, Ricky Ross, bitch we been the gang
Bottom of the black market, time to rise again

My inner Andre 3000
So many false allegations, is my image tainted
3 weeks in the hole, as if a nigga heinous
As I'm pacing in the cell all this pictures painted
All I wanted was some Bel Air and a Danish
Inmates gave me commissary just because I'm famous
Or is it 'cause I'm rich and I know what pain is? 
Assassinate Trump like I'm Zimmerman
Now accept these words as they came from Eminem
Democratic party sentenced to the pendulum
Killing them, I voted for Andre Benjamin
Head of black music do you know what rhythm is? 
Stick your head in the basket, it gets venomous
Straight clear my chicks finish my sentences
Time to squash the beef, or kill a nemesis
Show up at the wedding in my Timberlands
And for the record, know my best man will kill a bitch

So if I die before I wake, say I, I lived my way
Never said I would be perfect
Never said that I deserved it
Never said I wouldn't lie
Never said I wouldn't make my mom cry

I hope you learn to make it on your own
And if you love yourself just know you'll never be alone
I hope that you get everything you want and that you chose
I hope that it's the realest thing that you ever know
Hope you get the pretty girls, that's pretty and everything
Million dollar cribs havin' million dollar dreams
And when you get it all just remember one thing
Remember one thing
That one man could change the world

All I, all I wanted was a hundred million dollars and a bad chick
Imagine this so much some nights it felt like that I had it
Back on the mattress
Starin' at the ceilin' tryna to connect the dots
But its hard makin' those attachments
I'm talkin' dreamin' so hard, some nights it felt like draft day
You know? My - my step brother used to flip them bags outside the crib like it was trash day
No Kim K, but he bagged yay (Ye)
But when you're getting fast money, slow down, don't crash
With all the drive in the world, swear you still need gas
Look, think about it, close your eyes, dream about it
Tell your team about it, go make million dollar schemes about it
Success is on the way, I feel it in the distance
Used to look up at the stars and be like ain't too much that's different
I be shinin', they be shinin', get your one shot don't you miss it
What you know bout' wakin' up everyday like you on a mission?

I hope you learn to make it on your own
And if you love yourself just know you'll never be alone

And when you get it all just remember one thing
Remember one thing
That one man could change the world

My grandma told me if you write your name in stone you'll never get the white out
I grinded out that black hole then performed up at the white house
Standin' next to Jim Carrey, we traded stories then laughed
I said you not the only one I know got rich wearin' masks
Where I'm from I swear they broke, they need way more than the cast
We need more than what you have
And then we need more than that
But how am I supposed to say I'm tired
If that girl from West Virginia came up in conditions that I couldn't survive
Went to war, came back alive
On top of that became a female black captain
When being black you had to extra extra try
Way before James Brown made us proud
She bought a crib on the same street as Marvin Gaye
Right there on Outer Drive, and she taught me how to drive
And she raised the kids, then the kids' kids, and she did it right
Taught me how to love, taught me not to cry
When I die, I hope you teach me how to fly
All my life you've been that angel in disguise saying

I hope you learn to make it on your own
And if you love yourself just know you'll never be alone
I hope that you get everything you want and that you chose
I hope that it's the realest thing that you ever know
Hope you get the pretty girls, that's pretty and everything

John Legend,"If I had to play God for a day
I would open up the gates let the world see my face
Remove all doubt from the ones without the faith
And put them on the path of the straight
A safe place, for the young to come outside they want to play
I let their mommas know that they ok
And when y'all pray, I'll respond so you can all see a sign
And answer every pray one at a time
If I'm God huh
All the stabbings all the war would come to cease
My whole entire hood would be at peace
No more beef
And you could sleep without the fears of being woke
By the sounds of sirens, screams of people being smoked
No more dope you don't need it
You'll be cured of all diseases
Your whole entire life would be deleted
Please forgive me I've been dreaming
And rudely interrupted by the demons
Laughed at the picture I was seeing on the ceiling

Who listens when we pray
Who pulls the strings of the world as we struggle today
Will you show your face
I don't want to wait wait, wait 'til I die
Wait wait, wait for my eyes to close
Smile on your child so he knows
God has a face

Just imagine if the devil had a day
And God had took a break and walked away
Would you feel safe?
If everything you loved turned into hate
Will the dark angel's evil show you grace
Only to be eaten by a snake
One life one mistake
Be careful of the choices that you make
'Cause one day you'll be standing on your feet and then the next
You're underneath the sheet greeting death
I wonder when I sleep is he there sitting on my chest, stealing breath
Shortening my days even less
Lost souls never rest
A killer walks the streets seeking flesh
A adolescent hangs she depressed
A priest who confessed
A judged typing a nigga in a text
Your honor what the fuck did you expect
A father kills his son look at life it's a mess
Just imagine what would happen if the lord up and left

Who listens when we pray
Who pulls the strings of the world as we struggle today
Will you show your face
I don't want to wait wait, wait 'til I die
Wait wait, wait for my eyes to close
Smile on your child so he knows
God has a face

When all that you believed in was a lie
Are you willing to accept it when you find out
Or try to reason with yourself that's what it is when it's not
And all the whole while it's been a plot
To poison our minds and leave us blind to the fact
That they keep us in the dark know they act
We react all surprised and not realize that
This shit a trap
Thought religion was the answer but the answer wasn't that
The church and these politics they all full of crap
It's a shame but that's how were blaming it's for the scratch
So I don't knock I'm tryna to put a black card in my wallet
But some dollars in my pocket ain't the topic
Y'all need to stop it
This is just crazy these little babies ticking time bombs
Walking around the lunchroom pulling guns
If momma and daddy took the time to raise their son
Then the sister wouldn't be the mom before she twenty-one huh

Who listens when we pray
Who pulls the strings of the world as we struggle today
Will you show your face

Wait wait, wait for my eyes to close

Formed against, yes glory is destined

Sins that go against our skin become blessings

Freedom is like religion to us
Justice is juxtapositionin' us
Justice for all just ain't specific enough
One son died, his spirit is revisitin' us
Truant livin' livin' in us, resistance is us
That's why Rosa sat on the bus
That's why we walk through Ferguson with our hands up
When it go down we woman and man up

Enemy is lethal, a king became regal

Somewhere in the dream we had an epiphany
Now we right the wrongs in history

John Legend,"The wind against my face, tells me that I must go
Can't stay around too long before my tracks gonna catch me
When they do, I've got to be somewhere in LA
So I can look at the sun and get my thinking done
And if it's gonna rain tomorrow, let it rain

The last note I sang was indeed a false behave
At some old and shabby bar, I never knew the name
But I knew I couldn't work there, 'cause to follow my dreams
They tell me find that place, find that place

And if it's gonna rain tomorrow, let it rain
Let it rain, let it rain
Let it rain, let it rain

Deep in my destination, tryna find my destination
With LA so far away and I'm soaking cold today
Constantly it's on my mind
I'm only halfway there, I'm not caring how much frustration
Oh, I've got to cross this nation

And if it's gonna rain tomorrow, let it rain
Let it rain, let it rain
Let it rain, let it rain

As the rain falls down from the heavens
Think of how far I came since '87
Took my hustle and made it a weapon
I was always told ""in the pain there's a blessing""
Mistakes that I made, they mirrored the lessons
Talking with God, I asked clearer questions
Dear Lord, is this what I'm destined for?
If so? then what am I stressing for?
We tight, then why can't I let it go?
Everything gon' be alright, it's more than a metaphor
Let it rain 'cause it's ancestral
Cleanse my heart so they can see the best in you
Let it rain and come down visceral
For those no longer here in the physical
Let it rain 'cause it's like tears from you
Just like the rain, I'll do what I'm here to do
Let it rain, I know that it's purposeful
So that it can service you and return to you
Let it rain, let the rain surround me
And never drown me, I was lost when it found me
Now in a dream is where I'll be
Imperial reign came down to crown me
Now in a dream is where I'll be
Imperial reign came down to crown me
Imperial reign came down to crown me
Now in a dream, a dream is where I'll be

On a windy day, we went flying.

Everybody trying to put us down

After you caused so much pain
But then again, you're not to blame
You're just a human, a victim of the insane

Afraid of the sun

We love in a prison
We dream in a prison like fools

Reach for yourself and your battered mates
Mirror becomes a razor when it's broken

Thrown out without reason like tools

And die in a prison as a rule

Mirror becomes a razor when it's broken
Look in the mirror and see your shattered fate

And wait for no reason for you

You'd be sorry and wish you were dead
You should have the luck of the Irish
And you'd wish you was English instead!

A thousand years of torture and hunger
Drove the people away from their land
A land full of beauty and wonder
Was raped by the British brigands! Goddamn! Goddamn!

If you could keep voices like flowers
There'd be shamrock all over the world
If you could drink dreams like Irish streams
Then the world would be high as the mountain of morn

In the 'Pool they told us the story
How the English divided the land
Of the pain, the death and the glory
And the poets of Auld Ireland

If we could make chains with the morning dew
The world would be like Galway Bay
Let's walk over rainbows like leprechauns
The world would be one big Blarney stone

Why the hell are the English there anyway?
As they kill with God on their side
Blame it all on the kids the IRA
As the bastards commit genocide! Aye! Aye! Genocide!

Remember the joke you told me
While we had our midnight tea.
That was the funniest joke I ever heard in my life,
I didn't tell you then 'cause I was drinking the tea.

Alfred, now Alfred, you used to call me so.
And told me how it would be nice to open a plant shop.
That was the most sensible idea we had in our life,
I didn't tell you then 'cause I was reading the papers.

Mildred, oh, Mildred, how I love you so,
Remember how you were angry when I talked to the box.
You kept trying to tell me something, something about your life,
But I didn't hear you then 'cause I was watching the box.

I bought a pot of plant now
And I'm watering it ev'ry day.
I watched the late night talk show
And asked the man in a suit
Why he was laughing so when my wife was dead.

He didn't reply,
No, he didn't reply at all.
And I burnt the box the next morning
And buried in our garden.

Mildred, oh, Mildred, how I miss you so,
How I wish to tell you a lot of things about our life.
But of course you aren't around, you aren't around no more
And I hear the box still laughing in the next door apartment.","Mildred, Mildred [#][*]",1973

John Lennon,"I got a girl named Bony Moronie, 
She's as skinny as a stick of macaroni, 
Ought to see her rock 'n' roll with her blue jeans on, 
She's not very fat just skin and bone. 
But I love her, she loves me, 
All are happy now we can be, 
Making love underneath the apple tree. 

I told her mama and her papa too, 
Just exactly what I want to do, 
I want to get married on a night in June, 
And rock and roll by the light of a silvery moon, 
And I love her, she loves me, 
All are happy now we can be, 
Making love underneath the apple tree. 

She's my one and only, she's my heart's desire, 
She's a real upsetter, she's a real live wire, 
Everybody turns when my baby walks by, 
She's something to see, she really catches the eye. 
That's why I love her, she loves me, 
All are happy now we can be, 
Making love underneath the apple tree.

Back bedroom, full of piss, and shit, and fuckin' midwives.  God, you can't
Forget that awful moment, you know. You should have been in the bloody
War, lad, and you would know all about it. Well, I'll tell you something...)

I never told you, I never will
'Cause I'm on again and off again
If I can't hold you, somebody will

Love is like the ocean
Forever in motion, forever changing
Never twice the same
You may miss me one day
You may wish you hadn?t stayed
You may forget me
You may never let me go

'Cause I'm on again and off again
I never told you, I never will
'Cause I'm on again and off again
If I can't hold you, somebody will

On again and off again

'Cause I'm on again and off again

John Lennon,"You're always such a spectacle
You said you would
But you never will change
You only do it if I do the same
Love is such a dangerous game
A dangerous game

At first I could see
That you were weak in the knees
Your smile was so rehearsed
When you gave me your t-shirt
On the honeymoon
Where we never left the room
Sometimes I want to go back there
But then I'll remember
I've got to remember

You're always such a spectacle
Guess it was the best you could do
Your favourite dress for the world to see through
You spilled your drink but you didn't mean to
You're always such a spectacle
You said would but you never will change
You only do it if I do the same
Love is such a dangerous game
A dangerous game

When you told me this
That wickedness is a myth
That was invented for losers
Cause baby the truth hurts
Baby the truth hurts

Well I thought you were shallow
But then I fell in deep
Why couldn't you keep it
Our little secret
You're my only weakness

You're always such a spectacle
Guess it was the best you could do
Your favourite dress for the world to see through
You spilled your drink but you didn't mean to
Love is such a spectacle
Just when you think it's going well for you
Life's a movie that we sleep through
Every little thing that we do

You're always such a spectacle
Nothing ever really does change
Cause if you feel it baby
Know I feel the same
Love is such a dangerous game
Love is such a dangerous game
A dangerous game

Everyone is born to die
So take your time but don't take mine
Lose yourself but don't lose your mind

The moon and the sea
I'll be waiting for you my dear
Just wait and see

You can't regret what you forget
If only you could forget it
But it takes time and plenty of wine
The weight of the world there in your eyes

And nothing good will ever come to you unless you try try try
You find yourself in trouble if you cannot tell a lie
It's easy as pie

Somewhere out there in between
The moon and the sea

John Lennon & Yoko Ono,"Don't be scared
Don't be scared
Don't be scared to love
Better to love than never love at all
Don't be scared 

Don't be shy
Don't be shy
Don't be shy to tell
You may lose the chance to tell
Don't be shy 

When your hearts are lit
Drop your survival kit
Then you never have to
Run or split 

Sun in the east
Moon in the west
This boat's moving slow
There's no land in sight at all
Away we go 

Don't be scared
Don't be scared
Don't be scared to love
It's better to love than never love at all
Don't be scared",Don't Be Scared,1984
John Lennon & Yoko Ono,"Grow old along with me
The best is yet to be
When our time has come
We will be as one
God bless our love
God bless our love 

Grow old along with me
Two branches of one tree
Face the setting sun
When the day is done
God bless our love
God bless our love 

Spending our lives together
Man and wife together
World without end
World without end 

Grow old along with me
Whatever fate decrees
We will see it through
For our love is true
God bless our love
God bless our love",Grow Old with Me,1984
John Lennon & Yoko Ono,"Woke up this morning blues around my head
No need to ask the reason why
Went to the kitchen and lit a cigarette
Blew my worries to the sky 

I'm stepping out
I'm stepping out
I'm stepping out
I'm stepping out 

If it don't feel right you don't have to do it
Just leave a message on the phone and tell them to screw it
After all is said and done you can't go pleasin' everyone
So screw it

I'm stepping out
I'm stepping out
I'm stepping out baby
I'm stepping out 

Baby's sleeping the cats have all been blessed
Ain't nothing doing on TV (summer repeats)
Put on my space suit I got to look my best
I'm going out to do the city 

I'm stepping out
I'm stepping out
I'm stepping out babe
I'm stepping out (boogie) 

I'm stepping out (hold it down)
I'm stepping out
I'm stepping out
Gotta gotta gotta gotta get out
I'm stepping out babe
Just awhile
Ain't been out for days",I'm Stepping Out,1984
John Lennon & Yoko Ono,"Let me count the ways how I love you
It's like that gentle wind you feel at dawn
It's like that first sun that hits the dew
It's like that cloud with a gold lining telling us softly
That it'll be a good day, a good day for us
Thank you, thank you, thank you 

Let me count the ways how I miss you
It's like that oak tree in my childhood garden
It's like that first summer I spent in Egypt
It's like that warm evening you read to me
Both knowing deeply
That it's a good time, a good time for us
Thank you, thank you, thank you 

Let me count the ways how I see you
It's like that lake in the mountain you heard about
It's like that autumn sky that stays so blue
It's like that air around me that holds me gently
Whispering strongly that you're always there, always for me
Thank you, thank you, thank you",Let Me Count the Ways,1984
John Lennon & Yoko Ono,"Everybody's talking and no one says a word
Everybody's making love and no one really cares
There's Nazis in the bathroom just below the stairs
Always something happening and nothing going on

There's always something happening cooking and nothing in the pot
They're starving back in China so finish what you got
They're starving back in China so finish what you got
Nobody told me there'd be days like these

Nobody told me there'd be days like these
Nobody told me there'd be days like these
Strange days indeed
strange days indeed
Everybody's runnin' and no one makes a move

Everyone's a winner
and no one seems to lose
There's a little yellow idol to the north of Katmandu
Everybody's flying and no one leaves the ground

Everybody's crying and no one makes a sound
There's a place for us in movies you just gotta stay around

Nobody told me there'd be days like these
Nobody told me there'd be days like these
Nobody told me there'd be days like these
Strange days indeed
most peculiar
Mama

Everybody's smoking and no one's getting high

Everybody's flying and never touch the sky
There's Ufo's over New York and I ain't too surprised
Nobody told me there'd be days like these

Nobody told me there'd be days like these
Nobody told me there'd be days like these
Strange days indeed
most peculiar, Mama",Nobody Told Me,1984
John Lennon & Yoko Ono,"It's only sane to be insane
Psychotic builds a castle
And neurotic lives in it
I don't know what to do with my sanity
When the world's at the verge of calamity 

O'sanity, O'sanity
What am I to do with you
Drink up, shoot up, anything you please
But you're always standing behind me like a devil in hell 

O'sanity, o'sanity
Why don't you let me go
Let go, let go, cut it out!",O' Sanity,1984
John Lennon & Yoko Ono,"Sleepless night
The moon is bright
All I'm asking for is
Three minute love 

Legs
What am I going to do with my legs
They're so hot
They won't stay on the cot
And they're screaming! 

Sleepless night
The moon is bright
All I'm asking for is
Three minute love 

Head
What am I going to do with my head
It's so light
It just gives me the fright
It's full of champagne and dreams 

Sleepless night
All um umm
All I'm asking for is
Three minute love 

This brush must sell like crazy
I mean there's a lot of lonely people out there 

I want to go to the ball
I want to give it all
I'll take it all

John Lennon & Yoko Ono,"Mountains may move
Rivers may run
But you make me be myself
You make me be
How do I tell you?
How do I tell
You're the one?

Stars may move
Time may run
But you make me free myself
You make me free
How do I tell you?
How do I tell
You're the one
You're the one?

In the world's eye
We were Laurel and Hardy
In our minds
We were Heathcliff and Cathy
In a moment of wisdom
We were a wizard and a witch
In a moment of freedom
We were Don Quixote and Sancho
In reality
We were just a boy and a girl
Who never looked back

How can I tell you?
How could I tell you
