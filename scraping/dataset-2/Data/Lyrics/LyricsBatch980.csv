Sarah McLachlan,"Make me a witness
Take me out
Out of darkness
Out of doubt

I won't weigh you down
With good intention
Won't make fire out of clay
Or other inventions

Will we burn in heaven
Like we do down here
Will the change come while we're waiting?

Everyone is waiting

And when we're done
Soul searching
And we carried the weight
And died for a cause
Is misery made beautiful
Right before our eyes
Mercy will be revealed
Or blind us where we stand

Will we burn in heaven
Like we do down here
Will the change come while we're waiting?
Everyone is waiting

Will we burn in heaven
Like we do down here
Will the change come while we're waiting?
Everyone is waiting",Witness [Live],2013
Sarah McLachlan,"Give me release
Witness me
I am outside
Give me peace
Heaven holds a sense of wonder
And I wanted to believe that I'd get caught up 
When the rage in me subsides

Passion
Chokes the flower
Until she cries no more
Possessing all the beauty
Hungry still for more

Heaven holds a sense of wonder
And I wanted to believe that I'd get caught up 
When the rage in me subsides

In this white wave
I am sinking 
In this silence
In this white wave
In this silence

I believe I can't help this longing
Comfort me I can't hold it all in
If you won't let me

Heaven holds a sense of wonder
And I wanted to believe that I'd get caught up
When the rage in me subsides

In this white wave
I am sinking
In this silence
In this white wave
In this silence

I believe I have seen you
In this white wave
You are silent
You are breathing
In this white wave

I am free",Silence [Edit],2013
Sarah McLachlan,"You turn the radio on
Play your favorite song and cry (Cry)
You let it all disappear
Push back the doubt and fear they try (Try)

To hold your head under the waves
But you’re breathing all the same
You are stronger than their hate

Time for you to walk out walk in your own shoes
Lay down your footprints wherever you choose
Leave it all behind and move on you are your own woman

You never asked for trouble
But you’ve got fire that burns so bright (Bright)
You turn and face the struggle
When all the others turn and hide (Hide)

You hold your head above the waves
Above the war they try to wage
You are stronger than their hate

Time for you to walk out walk in your own shoes
Lay down your footprints wherever you choose
Leave it all behind and move on ’cause you are your own woman

Ooh ah yeah
Ooh ah yeah
Ooh ah yeah

Time for you to walk out walk in your own shoes
Lay down your footprints wherever you choose
Leave it all behind and move on
You are your own woman
Move on yeah
Time for you to walk out walk in your own shoes
Lay down your footprints wherever you choose
Say what’s on your mind with pride
‘Cause you are your own woman

(Ooh ah yeah) You’ve got a light that always guides you
(Ooh ah yeah) You speak of hope and change as something good
(Ooh ah yeah) Live your truth and know you’re not alone

You turn the radio on
Play your favorite song and sing out so loud",In Your Shoes,2014
Sarah McLachlan,"One thing that I know
It will get better
Each and every drought
Ends in the river

If I were a diviner, you'd be awash in rain to cool your fire
Oh to cool your fire

There could be winds of change in my auburn hair
But I'll tie it back for now
And when the bitter breeze carries a trace of fear
We'll persevere some how

We're gonna push on through, pretty girl
Just like we always do, beautiful girl
I know the world can be cruel, pretty girl
You're gonna make it 'cause you've got love on your side

The truth of letting go
Lies in the answer
That when the storm subsides
I'll still be there to hold you

There's beauty in your violence,
And the dissonant melody I
Hear you sing
Oh I love to hear you sing

There could be winds of change in my auburn hair
But I'll tie it back for now
And when the bitter breeze carries a trace of fear
We'll persevere somehow

We're gonna push on through, pretty girl
Just like we always do, beautiful girl
I know the world can be cruel, pretty girl
You're gonna make it 'cause you got love on your side

Pretty girl

One thing that I know
Is it will get better",Beautiful Girl,2014
Sarah McLachlan,"It would be if it could be, so wonderful if we succeed
Your warmth and your words found a place in my world and breathed new life in

We come from the brink of destruction
We gathered ourselves from the floor
We tried and we suffered and finally recovered
And found a new way to live
We’re two side by side with impossible dreams
Taking a chance to let love in

Storms come I learned to be strong
I don’t lean on anyone else
But now I am so content here in your arms
I don’t want to be anywhere else
With you I’m home, with you I’m home

I hold fast to my destination,
I know that the road will be long
We light up the sky let the beauty define us and give,
Give it all we got
We’re two side by side with impossible dreams
Taking a chance to let love in

Storms come, I learned to be strong
I don’t lean on anyone else
But now I’m so content here in your arms
I don’t want to be anywhere else
With you I’m home, with you I’m home

La da da da, la da da da, la da da da da",Brink of Destruction,2014
Sarah McLachlan,"Are we just drops of rain
Falling for a little while
Playing hard we lose and gain
Trying to hold on to what matters

Till the end

I keep walking forward
Like I know where I’m heading
How I wish you were here
To see me trying to live up to my name

Till the end

I should be thinking with my head
Not with my broken heart
Look to the future for all it can give
And not to us being apart

We trip and fall and stand again
And go on with our heads held high
We laugh and love as best we can
Trying to hold on to the wonder

How long, how long?

I should be thinking with my head
And not with my broken heart
Look to the future for all it’s got
And not to us being apart

Sometimes I feel I can’t go on
I let it get me down so hard to heal oh and I fall
Fall to my knees it hurts to survive the love that’s gone

But I should be thinking with my head
And not with my broken heart
Look to the future for all it’s got
And not to us being apart",Broken Heart,2014
Sarah McLachlan,"Desire is no cautious creature
Insatiable like raging fire
A heat is rising all around
My senses so alive
It searches out the darkest places
No fear of walls or ways concealed
Set alight my secret longings
All revealed when I’m near you

Logic escapes me and I can’t breathe
'Cause you burn to my bones
Like you’re all I’ve ever known
Let thunder crash let rivers flood
If all we are is flesh and blood

The fury of the storm confounds me
Violence and beauty all collide
In all my animal emotions I can’t fight this tide
'Cause you are the wave that pulls me under
Ravage me from head to heart
And all my careful calculations
Fall apart when I’m near you

Logic escapes me, and I can’t breathe
'Cause you burn to my bones
Like you’re all I’ve ever known
Let thunder crash let rivers flood
If all we are is flesh and blood
Ooh ooh
Let thunder crash let rivers flood
If all we are is flesh and blood

'Cause you burn to my bones
Like you’re all I’ve ever known
Let thunder crash let rivers flood
If all we are is flesh and blood

Ooh ooh
Let thunder crash let rivers flood
If all we are is flesh and blood

Ooh ooh
Let thunder crash let rivers flood
If all we are is flesh and blood

Come together, fall apart
We build our towers with paper walls
As if we have any control, let's burn it all",Flesh and Blood,2014
Sarah McLachlan,"I know now there’s no one here to blame
I could but what good would that do
It wouldn’t change a thing
So I grew accustomed to the shame
The sharp sting of your poison
Trying so hard to erase
All the good in me

If this is love beside me
I’m working on forgiveness
Laying the past down behind me
Letting go the ways that I’ve been hurt
Let the rivers rise and rage
I’ll try and stand with grace
If everything is love

In the end the war had left us broken
Mourning all the things I’d lost
The debts I couldn’t pay,
But I didn’t want to disappear
I was caught in TV static
Sinking into grey
No more to give away

If this is love beside me
I’m working on forgiveness
Laying the past down behind me
Letting go the ways that I’ve been hurt
Let the rivers rise and rage
I’ll try to stand with grace
If everything is love

If this is love beside me
I’m working on forgiveness
Laying the past down behind me
Letting go the ways that I’ve been hurt
Let the rivers rise and rage
I’ll try to stand with grace

If this is love beside me
This is love beside me
This is love beside me",Love Beside Me,2014
Sarah McLachlan,"When we were young
There were always creatures lurking under the bed
A thousand year old dragon lived deep in the lake
And he said ""Don't be afraid""
So you dove in

He seemed so sweet and lovely he made you laugh
And made you forget about the rain
Showed you new tricks on guitar
Hidden talents that erases the pain, ah

And don't you know that there's a wolf
Stalking in sheep's clothing
Tells me he's the real thing
Think what your life would be missing
If you didn't have him to sing
To sing about

Three headed monsters
They want your money wanna be in the picture
Be your friend
They fill your pool
With alligators are they all just jokers or are they cruel

They light up when they see you
Like there's no where else that they'd rather be
Than by your side
Then they promise you the stars
But they're really just along for the ride, ah

And don't you know that there's a wolf
Stalking in sheep's clothing
Tells me he's the real thing
Think what your life would be missing
If you didn't have him to sing
To sing about, ah ah

Ah ah, ah

Is it the sparkle
In their eyes or the knowledge of the ways of the world
The way they kiss
The way they hold you
Has made you blind to the fangs and the fire

There's a wolf
Stalking in sheep's clothing
Tells me he's the real thing
Think what your life would be missing
If you didn't have him to sing
To sing about, ah
Ah ah, ah ah
Ah ah, ah, ah ah",Monsters,2014
Sarah McLachlan,"How I wish that I could tell you
It’s to you that I would run
You were the place that I could always rest my head
When my world had come undone

‘Cause I’ve been wrestling with my demons
They’re telling me I have no choice
How I wish that I could lean upon you now
Amidst the chaos and the noise

Your light buried the dark
A constant unwavering heart

You were the well to cool my fury
Deep and calm your waters feel
Your quiet words a salve to soothe my wayward soul
It was there I learned to heal

Your light buried the dark
A constant unwavering heart

Oh I hope that you can hear me
Through the ravages of time
You have carried me though more than you could know
I still feel your hand in mine

Your light buried the dark
A constant unwavering heart

Your light buried the dark
A constant unwavering heart (Unwavering heart)",Song for My Father,2014
Sarah McLachlan,"Can you hear it? This is the sound that love makes
The fingerprint of a snowflake
It paints a picture of you

Can you feel it? This is the flavor of sunshine
The way your body it moves mine
I can taste you in the coolest raindrops

One hand in the other unlike any other hand I know
I’m seeing the sun in all the darkest grey skies

This time I’m going in for the sweetest kill
I’m gonna eat till I get my fill
So delicious are my lips on your skin

One hand in the other unlike any other hand I know
I’m seeing the sun in all the darkest grey skies

Sweetness, this is the rhythm of thunder
From up above or down under
I love you",The Sound That Love Makes,2014
Sarah McLachlan,"Smooth stones down by the waterside
Give in to ebb and flow
Collide in blindness embrace and part
No fear of letting go
There’s no fight to get ahead,
Nowhere that they’d rather be

Safe in the arms of surrender and certainty
Caught in a moment and sure they’ll be carried
Take me back down to the water to feel that sure
Of anything

I write your name down in the swollen sand
And I walk out in the waves
I know you’re here I feel you all around me
In this sea of soothing gray
I don’t even feel the cold
It’s warm as you wash over me

Safe in the arms of surrender and certainty
Caught in a moment and sure I’ll be carried
Take me back down to the water to feel that sure
Of anything

Ooh
Ooh
Ooh ah

Rain like tears stream down the windshield
As we pull out on the road
You were the star by which I light my way
So how do I find my way now?

Back in the arms of surrender and certainty
Caught in a moment but sure we’ll be carried
I want to know what it feels like to be that sure
Of anything

Ooh ah
Ooh ah
Ooh ah
Ooh",Surrender and Certainty,2014
Sarah McLachlan,"Night falls heavy like an iron fist
The silence taut and frail
I weigh the depths of love and terror
In this test I cannot fail
'Cause there’s no map to guide the human heart
Down roads we’ve never been
Sometimes I feel I’m running blind but I’m trying

So turn the lights down low
Let the night come easy
Take my hand won’t you let me in
'Cause when the world comes crashing down inside your head
I’ll be right here right here for you

Words fall heavy out of tired mouths
Resigned to rage and roar
I see behind your eyes the tempest rising
And I can’t reach your shore
When all my good intentions fall apart
And I wind up on my knees
There’s nothing gained from being right but I’m trying

So turn the lights down low
Let the night come easy
Take my hand won’t you let me in
'Cause when the world comes crashing down inside your head
I’ll be right here, right here for you

So turn the lights down low
Let the night come easy
Take my hand won’t you let me in
'Cause when the world comes crashing down inside your head
I’ll be right here, I’ll be right here for you

Take my hand won’t you let me in
'Cause when the world comes crashing down inside your head
I’ll be right here, I’ll be right here waiting
Right here for you",Turn the Lights Down Low,2014

The years of galore, the guilt and tears

Once upon a time there was a mountain
That rose out of a vast green forest
And in the forest there were birds
And lakes and rocks and trees and rivers

The forest was also inhabited
By a small group of people called the lizards
The lizards were a simple people
And they had lived in the forest undisturbed
For thousands of years in utter peace and tranquility

Once a year when spring came
And the first blossoms began to show
The lizards would gather at the base of the mountain
To give thanks for all that they had

They thanked the birds
And they thanked the lakes and they thanked the rocks
And the trees and the rivers
But most importantly, they thanked Icculus

Icculus lived at the top of the mountain
Or at least everyone thought so
For no one had actually ever seen him

But they knew he existed
Because they had the Helping Friendly Book
Icculus had given the Helping Friendly Book
To the Lizards thousands of years earlier as a gift

It contained all of the knowledge
Inherent in the universe
And had enabled the Lizards
To exist in harmony with nature for years

And so they lived
Until one day a traveler arrived in Gamehendge
His name was Wilson
And he quickly became intrigued
By the Lizards way of life

He asked if he could stay on
And live in the forest
And the Lizards, who had never seen an outsider
Were happy to oblige

Wilson lived with the Lizards for a few years
Studying the ways of the Helping Friendly Book
And all was well

Until one morning when they awoke and the book was gone
Wilson explained that he had hidden the book
Knowing that the Lizards had become
Dependent on it for survival

He declared himself king
And enslaved the innocent people of Gamehendge
He cut down the trees and built a city
Which he called Prussia

And in the center of the city
He built a castle
And locked in the highest tower of the castle",Introduction,2006

Hear a way we die.
You can make the mountains ring,
Hear the angels cry.
Tho' the dove is on the wing
You need not know why.

Hey, people now,
Smile on your brother.
Let me see you get together,
Love one another right now.

Some will come and some will go,
We shall surely pass.
When the wind that left us here,
Returns for us at last.
We are but a moment's sunlight,
Fading on the grass.

In a corner of the city
Twice a year she gets back home
Playing catch-up with the family

She tells her folks what they need to know
Her mother says she's much too thin
Her sisters ask about her beau
Her dad inquires, how's business been

She's thirty-three this time around
She's always been real good at listening
Her sense of humor never lets her down
Except sometimes there's something missing

Hey, middle ground
A place between up and down
She could be safe and sound
Oh, to know middle ground

For years she's been on her guard
She's kind of tense around the shoulders
She wonders why she works so hard
She counts the days 'til they promote her

She'll take a weekend now and then
To stay in bed and watch the reruns
She'll turn the phone off when guilt sets in
But Sunday always kinda leaves her let down

Hey, middle ground; a place between up and down
She could be safe and sound; oh, to know middle ground

She gave her heart away one time, and says that she hasn't seen it since
Love's a puzzle in her mind; the pieces match, but don't quite fit; hey...
And these days run thick or thin
It never rains, or else it's pouring
All her single friends are men
She thinks married girls are so damn boring

Sarah Rice,"Green Finch and Linnet bird
Nightingale, Blackbird
How is it you sing?

How can you jubilate
Sitting in cages
Never taking wing?

Outside the sky waits
Beckoning, beckoning
Just beyond the bars

How can you remain
Staring at the rain
Maddened by the stars?

How is it you sing anything?
How is it you sing?

Green Finch and Linnet bird
Nightingale, Blackbird
How is it you sing?

Whence comes this melody
Constantly floating?
Is it rejoicing or merely a loaming?

Are you discussing?
Or fussing
Or simply dreaming?

Are you crowing?
Are you screaming?
Ring dove and Robinet

Is it for wages?
Singing to be sold?
Have you decided it's safer in cages
Singing when you're told?

My cage has many rooms
Damask and dark
Nothing there sings
Not even my Lark

Larks never will, you know
When they're captive
Teach me to be more adaptive

And let your love surround me

Are falling down around me

Even now I know this orbit that I'm in
Is spinning me to you
I am silenced by the will of my intent
To only be with you
Completely lost in you

Every dream I hide
Give them wings so they can fly to you
As I wait to find
All you have in mind for me to be

My ambitions fade away
They offer no resistance
Take me up into your space
Into your existence

Even now I know this orbit that I'm in
Is spinning me to you
I am silenced by the will of my intent
To only be with you
Completely lost in you

It is clear to me
I've nowhere to be without you, it's true
You're my gravity and I could never doubt you
I'm lost in you

Every day
Like the one before
Little town
Full of little people
Waking up to say

Bonjour bonjour
Bonjour bonjour bonjour

There goes the baker with his tray, like always
The same old bread and rolls to sell
Every morning just the same
Since the morning that we came
To this poor provincial town
Good morning, Belle
Good morning, monsieur Jean
Have you lost something again?

Well, I believe I have
Problem is, I've, I can't remember what
Oh well, I'm sure it'll come to me
Where you off to?

To return this book to Pere Robert, it's about to lovers in fair Verona
Sound boring

Look there she goes, that girl is strange, no question
Dazed and distracted, can't you tell?

Never part of any crowd
'Cause her head's up on some cloud
No denying she's a funny girl that Belle

Bonjour, good day
How is your family?
Bonjour, good day
How is your wife?
I need six eggs
That's too expensive!

Ah, If it isn't the only bookworm in town!
So, where did you run off to this week?

Two cities in Northern Italy
I didn't want to come back
Have you got any new places to go?

I'm afraid not
But you may re-read any of the old ones that you'd like
Your library makes our small corner of the world feel big

Bon voyage

Look there she goes, that girl is so peculiar
I wonder if she's feeling well
With a dreamy, far-off look
And her nose stuck in a book
What a puzzle to the rest of us is Belle

Oh, isn't this amazing?
It's my favorite part because you'll see
Here's where she meets Prince Charming
But she won't discover that it's him 'til chapter three!

Now it's no wonder that her name means Beauty
Her looks have got no parallel

But behind that fair facade
I'm afraid she's rather odd
Very different from the rest of us

She's nothing like the rest of us
Yes, different from the rest of us is Belle!

Look at her, LeFou
My future wife
Belle is the most beautiful girl in the village
That's makes her the best

But she's so well-read
And you're so athletically-inclined

Yes, ever since the war, I felt like I've been missing something
She's the only girl that ever given me that sense of

Mmm je ne sais quoi?

I don't know what that means

Right from the moment when I met her, saw her
I said she's gorgeous and I fell
Here in town there's only she
Who is beautiful as me
So I'm making plans to woo and marry Belle

Look there he goes
Isn't he dreamy?

Oh, he's so cute!
Be still my heart
I'm hardly breathing
He's such a tall, dark, strong and handsome brute!

Bonjour, pardon
Good day, mais oui!
You call this bacon, what lovely flowers
Some cheese, ten yards, one pound,  excuse me I'll get the knife
Please let me through!
This bread, those fish, it's stale, they smell!
Madame's mistaken Well, maybe so

There must be more than this provincial life!

Just watch, I'm going to make Belle my wife!

Look there she goes the girl is strange, but special
A most peculiar mademoiselle!

No refunds, returns, or exchanges because once He's yours he's yours for good.""

They were selling pieces of heaven
And I thought, ""Hey what about me?
What am I considered?""

It was November and I think I pissed him off
He's mad but I don't care
You're my angel so there

So come on angel, stop all the tears
Come sing me a song or two

I'd fight fire and wind and rain
I'd cry a river of tears for them

Tell me, is that fair?

There are some things I can't forgive
Some things I just can't forgive

When she failed to yield the earth's demands
'Oh,' she said 'you mean that little ant farm?
I'm alright, dear, I've got other plans'

And we're sad because we think we don't belong here
We're guilty 'cause we think we should be stars
Floating in a navy soup, we're sailing
There you are
There you are

She's so bright, and then she's gone
Don't mind me I'm just sailing
On a sunrise, it's my favourite thing
And when are you going to realize
I don't blame you, I never have

And when she talks, she fills the room with sunlight
She can name her babies, every one
I've returned to the place of my beginning
And I can see her turning off the sun

And we're sad because we think we don't belong here
We're guilty 'cause we think we should be stars

When they turn on the lights

The part of me that holds me and won't let go

I keep telling myself it was not meant to be
I keep telling myself but my heart disagrees
No matter how many times
That I keep telling myself
I know I know there's nobody else

And at the end of the night
When they turn out the lights
And lovers go home like we used to do
I walk the empty streets I don't know where to go

Anger and tears, so many things to feel
Sensitive boy, good with his hands
No one mentions the unmentionable, but everybody understands

Here in this cold white room
Tied up to these machines
It's hard to imagine him as he used to be

Laughing, screaming, tumbling queen
Like the most amazing light show you've ever seen
Whirling, swirling, never blue
How could you go and die, what a lonely thing to do?

Silence equals death, this is what they say
But the anger and the tears do not take the pain away
How far must it go? How near must it be?
Before it touches you, before it touches me

Here in this cold white room
Tied up to these machines
It's hard to imagine life as it used to be

Laughing, screaming, tumbling queen
Like the most amazing light show you've ever seen
Whirling, swirling, never blue
How could you go and die, what a lonely thing to do?

Did you ever ask those strangers what they're looking for?
Did they laugh and tell you they're not really sure?
You were hurt by love but still you came right back for more

Sarah Vaughan,"A country dance was being held in a garden
I felt a bump and heard an ""Oh, beg your pardon""
Suddenly I saw polka dots and moonbeams
All around a pug-nosed dream

The music started and was I the perplexed one
I held my breath and said ""May I have the next one?""
In my frightened arms, polka dots and moonbeams
Sparkled on a pug-nosed dream

There were questions in the eyes of other dancers
As we floated over the floor
There were questions but my heart knew all the answers
And perhaps a few things more

Now in a cottage built of lilacs and laughter
I know the meaning of the words ""Ever after""
And I'll always see polka dots and moonbeams
When I kiss the pug-nosed dream",Polka Dots and Moonbeams,1957

You hit the spot
Like a balmy breeze on a night in May
You hit the spot
Like a cool mint julep on a summery day
You hit a new high in my estimation
I had to fall 'cause you've got so much on the ball

Oh, you hit the spot
Like the first embrace when the knot is tied

To disregard convention
It was just an impulse
That had to be obeyed

Is blemished I'm afraid

Naturally, you thought you couldn't
And probably we shouldn't

Actually, it all was blameless
Nevertheless, they'll call it shameless
So let's keep the lady nameless

Socially, I'll be an outcast
Obviously, we dined alone
On my good name there will be doubt cast
With never a sign of any chaperon

Out of town were the people I knew
I had that feeling of self-pity
What to do, what to do, what to do?
The outlook was decidedly blue

But as I walked through the foggy streets alone
It turned out to be the luckiest day I've known

A foggy day in London town
Had me low, had me down
I viewed the morning with much alarm
British museum had lost its charm

Could this thing last?

Let me tell you there are a lot of features

When you could be learning the steps of gladness
You'll be happy when you can do
Just six or seven

You'll find it nice
The quickest way to Paradise
When you practice
Here's the thing to know
Simply say as you go

I'll build a stairway to Paradise
With a new step every day
I'm gonna get there at any price
Stand aside; I'm on my way
I've got the blues
And up above it's so fair
Shoes, go on and carry me there
I'll build a stairway to Paradise
With a new step every day

Every new step
Helps a bit, but any old kind of two-step
Does as well; it don't matter what step you step
If you work it into your soul
You'll get to Heaven
Get busy
Dance with Maud the countess or just plain Lizzy
Dance until you're blue in the face and dizzy
When you've learned to dance in your sleep
You're sure to win out

Which beats the latest thing from France

And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms
The nightingale 
Tells his fairytale
Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain
My stardust melody
The memory of love's refrain.",Stardust,1958
Sarah Vaughan,"After one whole quart of brandy
Like a daisy, I'm awake
With no bromo-seltzer handy
I don't even shake

Men are not a new sensation
I've done pretty well I think
But this half-pint imitation
Put me on the blink

I'm wild again, beguiled again
A simpering, whimpering child again
Bewitched, bothered, and bewildered am I

Couldn't sleep and wouldn't sleep
When love came and told me I shouldn't sleep
Bewitched, bothered and bewildered am I

Lost my heart, but what of it?
He is cold I agree
He can laugh, but I love it
Although the laugh's on me

I'll sing to him, each spring to him
And long for the day when I'll cling to him
Bewitched, bothered, and bewildered am I

He's a fool and don't I know it
But a fool can have his charms
I'm in love and don't I show it
Like a babe in arms

Love's the same old sad sensation
Lately I've not slept a wink
Since this half-pint imitation
Put me on the blink

I've sinned a lot; I'm mean a lot
But I'm like sweet seventeen a lot
Bewitched, bothered, and bewildered am I

I'll sing to him, each spring to him
And worship the trousers that cling to him
Bewitched, bothered, and bewildered am I

When he talks, he is seeking
Words to get off his chest
Horizontally speaking, he's at his very best

Vexed again, perplexed again
Thank God, I can be oversexed again
Bewitched, bothered, and bewildered am I

Wise at last, my eyes at last
Are cutting you down to your size at last
Bewitched, bothered, and bewildered no more

Burned a lot, but learned a lot
And now you are broke, so you earned a lot
Bewitched, bothered, and bewildered no more

Couldn't eat, was dyspeptic
Life was so hard to bear
Now my heart's antiseptic
Since you moved out of there

Romance, finis, your chance, finis
Those ants that invaded my pants, finis
Bewitched, bothered, and bewildered no more","Bewitched, Bothered and Bewildered",1958
Sarah Vaughan,"When I was very young
The world was younger than I
As merry as a carousel

The circus tent was strung
With every star in the sky
Above the ring I loved so well
Now the young world has grown old
Gone are the tinsel and gold

Sit there and count your fingers
What can you do?
Old girl, you're through
Sit there and count your little fingers
Unlucky, little girl blue

Sit there and count the raindrops
Falling on you
It's time you knew
All you can count on is the raindrops
That fall on little girl blue

No use, old girl
You may as well surrender
Your hope is getting slender
Why won't somebody send a tender
Blue boy
To cheer little girl blue?

Sarah Vaughan,"I laughed at sweethearts I met at schools
All indiscreet hearts seemed romantic fools
A house in Iceland was my heart's domain
I saw your eyes; now castles rise in Spain

I took one look at you; that's all I meant to do
And then my heart stood still
My feet could step and walk, my lips could move and talk
And yet my heart stood still

Though not a single word was spoken, I could tell you knew
That un-felt clasp of hands told me so well you knew
I never lived at all until the thrill of that moment when
My heart stood still

Through all my school days I hated boys
Those April Fool days brought me loveless joys
I read my Plato, Love, I thought a sin
But since your kiss, I'm reading Missus Glyn",My Heart Stood Still,1958

My head is just a hat place
My breast an empty shell
And I've a faded dream to sell

All alone, all at sea
Why does nobody care for me?
When there's no love to hold my love
Why is my heart so frail
Like a ship without a sail?

Out on the ocean
Sailors can use a chart
I'm on the ocean
Guided by just a lonely heart

Still alone, still at sea
Still there's no one to care for me
When there's no hand to hold my hand
Life is a loveless tale
For a ship without a sail

I'm not entirely to blame

Right out of my life
Laugh, and forget this affair
Guess I was foolish to care

So I'm gonna dance you
Right out of my dreams
Try to be carefree and gay
I guess I'll learn to play the part

'Cause when our friends begin that
Heartless rumor
I know I'll really need my
Sense of humor

I'm gonna laugh you
Right out of my life
Make it a beautiful joke
No one will know you broke my heart

Really meant that last goodbye
Then I'm gonna laugh so hard I'll cry

Sarah Vaughan,"(and as the sun goes down I cry myself to sleep)
I watch the bugs crawling across my skin
Now that you are gone, I can let things crumble
And though it seems that this was meant to be
It's so hard to see and all I do is stumble

The candles burn but it's still too dark
I have given up so it's not worth trying

Angels, devils pray on my weak condition
And out of reach there's a tiny light
That could set things right if I could change position

Falling through the cracks
I'm only
Losing my will to live
I'm only
Broken and beaten down

I would open up the doors and let him in

Or it might be the sound of your hello
That music I hear
I get misty the moment you're near

You can say that you're leading me on
But it's just what I want you to do
Don't you notice how hopelessly I'm lost
That's why I'm following you

The quick toboggan when you reach the heights
I miss the kisses and I miss the bites

The lovely loving and the hateful hates
The conversation with the flying plates
I wish I were in love again

No more pain, no more strain
Now I'm sane, but I would rather be punch drunk

The pulled-out fur of cat and cur
The fine mis-mating of a him and her
I've learned my lesson, but I wish I were
In love again

The furtive sigh, the blackened eye
The words ""I love you, till the day I day""
The self-deception that believes the lie
I wish I were in love again

When love congeals, it soon reveals
The faint aroma of performing seals
The double-crossing of a pair of heals
I wish I were in love again

No, no more care, no, no despair
Now I'm all there (now), but I'd rather be punch drunk

And the beetle bugs are zooming
And the tulip trees are blooming
And there's not another human in view,
But us two

And the farmer leaves his reaping
And the meadow cows are sleeping
And the speckled trouts stop leaping up stream
As we dream
A far pink cloud hangs over the hill
Unfolding like a rose
If you hold my hand and sit real still,
You can hear the grass as it grows
It's a hazy afternoon
And i know a place that's quiet, except for daisies running riot
And there's no one passing by it to see
Come spend this lazy afternoon with me

Sarah Vaughan,"Your lips were like a red and ruby chalice,
Warmer than the Summer night.
The clouds were like an alabaster palace,
Rising to a snowy height.
Each star its own Aurora Borealis,
Suddenly you held me tight,
I could see the midnight sun.

I can't explain the silver rain that found me,
Or was that a moonlit veil?
The music of the universe around me,
Or was that a nightingale?
And then your arms miraculously found me,
Suddenly the sky turned pale,
I could see the midnight sun.

Was there such a night?
It's still a thrill I don't quite believe;
But after you were gone
There was still some stardust on my sleeve!

The flame of it may dwindle to an ember,
And the stars forget to shine,
And we may see the meadow in December,
Icy white and crystalline.
But oh, my darlin', always I'll remember
When your lips were close to mine,
And I saw the midnight sun.

Sitting demurely 'neath the cherry blossom trees
Miss Butterfly's her name
A sweet little innocent child was she
'Till a fine young American from the sea
To her garden came

They met 'neath the cherry blossoms everyday
And he taught her how to love the American way
To love with her soul t'was easy to learn

For she loved him so
The moments pass into hours
The hours pass into years
And as she smiles through her tears
She murmurs low

I'm sure he'll come to me by and by
But if he won't come back, then I'll never sigh or cry
I just must die

We almost seem like strangers
All that's left between us are the memories we shared
Of times we thought we cared for each other

There's nothing left to do but go our separate ways
And pick up all the pieces left behind us
And maybe someday, somewhere along the way
Another love will find us

Some day when she's older, maybe she will understand
Why her mom and dad are not together
The tears that she will cry when I have to say goodbye
Will tear at my heart forever

Every voice would be a voice to be heard
Take my word: we would treasure each day that occurred

My world would be a beautiful place
Where we would weave such wonderful dreams
My world would wear a smile on its face

My imagination is changing the skyline we know
Step into my fantasy and, baby, don't let me go

Feels like we've started a party and covered the city with dreams

I don't wanna see the morning coming
I don't want the dark to turn to light
I can feel a dream about to happen
Gonna make the city ours tonight

Traffic's going nowhere, we're glad just to walk hand in hand
Shadows move in time to the rhythm of woman and man

Sarah Vaughan,"Oh, it's a long, long while
From May to December

Sarah Vaughan,"Stars in the sky were dancing
One night perfect for romancing
The night a sinner kissed an angel
He wanted thrills, she wanted love

Oh, but his sighs were tender
As he begged her to surrender
The night a sinner kissed an angel
And she believed that it was love

How was she to know that every lovely vow
Was part of the game he was playing?
But to his surprise he realized
Somehow he meant every word he was saying

Yes, miracles can happen
I know 'cause I saw what happened
That night a sinner kissed an angel
That was the night I fell in love",A Sinner Kissed an Angel,1987

Like the seasons, he'll come and he'll go
Just as free as a bird and as good as his word
That's why everybody loves him so

Always leaving his spoon in his coffee
Tucks his napkin up under his chin
And that yellow cow-pie is so mellow it's ripe
But you needn't be ashamed of him
Every Friday he'll go fishing, down on his favorite lake
But he only hooks a perch or two, the whale got away
Looks like we warm the steak

But now it's too late
I thought I'd found the man of my dreams
Now it seems this is how the story ends

I thought for once it couldn't go wrong
Not for long--I can see the way this ends

It's too deep to express
And when he tries to use his eyes

Are nobody's business, dear

I've lost my heart and I've lost my soul
But as for losing my self-control
Don't look at me that way

I just adore your loving arms
In fact they're two of your greatest charms
But don't look at me that way

I'm very mild, I'm very meek
My will is strong, but my wont is weak
So don't look at me that way

Begins to show in your stare
There's a hocus-pocus about your focus

Let's take an old fashioned walk; I'm just bursting with talk
What a tale could be told if we went for an old fashioned walk
Let's take a stroll through the park, down a lane where it's dark
And a heart that's controlled may relax on an old fashioned walk

I know for a couple who seem to be miles apart
There's nothing like walking and having a heart-to-heart
I know a girl who declined, couldn't make up her mind
She was wrapped up and sold coming home from an old fashioned walk

Taking me out for a breath of air, saying, ""The carriage awaits""

Sarah Vaughan,"Before Lord God made the sea or the land
He held all the stars in the palm of his hand
And they ran through his fingers like grains of sand
And one little star fell alone

Then the Lord God hunted through the wide night air
For the little dark star in the wind down there
And he stated and promised he'd take special care
So it wouldn't get lost no more

Now a man don't mind if the stars get dim
And the clouds blow over and darken him
So long as the Lord God's watching over him
Keeping track how it all goes on

But I've been walking through the night and the day
Till my eyes get weary and my head turns gray
And sometimes it seems maybe God's gone away
Forgetting his promise and the word he'd say

Just as wonderful with both feet on the ground
It's that second time you hear your love song sung
Makes you think perhaps that love, like youth, is wasted on the young

Like a friendly home the second time you call
Who can say what brought us to this miracle we've found?
There are those who'll bet  love comes but once, and yet

Going through the motions
I bet she tried to warn me 
And I didn't even notice
'Til I got home and found her gone

Folded with a key on top
Sitting on the dresser
I opened it
It simply read

Look and you will find me

I'll be right here 
Waiting for you with open arms
I don't want to live without you

And miss me in your life

And all that I am left with
Is how I let her go 
And the letter she wrote
Saying you'll find me

I spent the next eight hours wondering 
Where on earth you were
It was getting late, I was getting tired 
And growing more concerned
When all at once it hit me, 
That piano bar back home
Where I asked you to marry me
And there you were alone

I knew I would find you
And how it warmed my heart
To see you right there 
Waiting for me with open arms
Said I don't know where I'm going,

Is something I just can't live with

Those come-what-may places
Where one relaxes on the axis of the wheel of life
To get the feel of life
From jazz and cocktails

The girls I knew had sad and sullen gray faces
With distinguish traces
That used to be there
You could see where they'd been washed away
By too many through the day
Twelve o'clock tales

Then you came along with your siren song
To tempt me to madness
I thought for awhile that your poignant smile
Was tinged with the sadness
Of a great love for me
Ah yes, I was wrong
Again, I was wrong

Life is lonely again
And only last year
Everything seemed so sure
Now life is awful again

She was just Miss Jones to me

Sarah Vaughan,"Perdido, I look for my heart it's perdido
I lost it way down in Torido
While chancing a dance fiesta
Bolero, he glanced as I danced the Bolero
He said taking off his sombrero: 'Let's meet for a sweet fietsa'
High was the sun when we first came close
Low was the moon when we said adios
Perdido, since then has my heart been perdido
I know I must go to Torido, that yearning to lose perdido
I look for my heart it's perdido
I lost it way down in Torido
He glanced as I danced the Bolero
He smiled as he tipped his sombrero
High was the moon when we first came close
Low was the moon when we said adios
Since then has my heart been perdido
I must go to Torido, that yearning telude
Perdido oeoeoeoe Perdido oeoeoeoe Perdido
The day the fiesta started
Perdido oeoeoeoe Perdido oeoeoeoe Perdido
That's when my heart departed
It's perdido

Sarah Vaughan,"My story is much too sad to be told
But practically everything leaves me totally cold
The only exception I know is the case
When I'm out on a quiet spree
Fighting vainly the old ennui
And I suddenly turn and see your fabulous face

I get no kick from champagne
Mere alcohol doesn't thrill me at all
So tell me, why should it be true
That I get a kick out of you?

Some get a kick from cocaine
I'm sure that if I took even one sniff
That would bore me terrifically too
But I get a kick out of you

I get a kick every time I see you standing there before me
I get a kick, though it's clear to me you obviously don't adore me
I get no kick in a plane; flying too high with some guy in the sky
Is my idea of nothing to do, yet I get a kick out of you

Sarah Vaughan,"Lover, when I'm near you, and I hear you speak my name
Softly, in my ear you breathe a flame

Lover, when we're dancing, keep on glancing in my eyes
Till loves own entrancing music dies

All of my future is in you
Your every plan I design
Promise you'll always continue
To be mine

Lover, please, be tender; when you're tender, fears depart
Lover, I surrender to my heart

Lover, it's immoral, but why quarrel with our bliss
When two lips of coral want to kiss?

I say the devil is in you, and to resist you, I try
But if you didn't continue, I would die

Lover, please, be tender; when you're tender, fears depart
Lover, I surrender to my heart","Lover, Come Back to Me",1993

Sarah Vaughan,"Oh! Will you never let me be?
Oh! Will you never set me free?
The ties that bound us
Are still around us
There's no escape that I can see
And still those little things remain
That bring me happiness or pain

A cigarette that bears a lipstick's traces
An airline ticket to romantic places
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
A tinkling piano in the next apartment
Those stumbling words that told you what my heart meant
A fair ground's painted swings
These foolish things remind me of you
You came you saw you conquer'd me
When you did that to me
I knew somehow this had to be
The winds of March that make my heart a dancer
A telephone that rings but who's to answer?
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

First daffodils and long excited cables
And candle lights on little corner tables
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
The park at evening when the bell has sounded
The ""Ile de France"" with all the gulls around it
The beauty that is Spring's
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The sigh of midnight trains in empty stations
Silk stockings thrown aside dance invitations
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

Gardenia perfume ling'ring on a pillow
Wild strawb'ries only seven francs a kilo
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
The smile of Garbo and the scent of roses
The waiters whistling as the last bar closes
The song that Crosby sings
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The scent of smould'ring leaves, the wail of steamers
Two lovers on the street who walk like dreamers
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you",These Foolish Things,1994
Sarah Vaughan,"""Clang, clang, clang"" went the trolley
""Ding, ding, ding"" went the bell
""Zing, zing, zing"" went my heartstrings
For the moment I saw him I fell
 
""Chug, chug, chug"" went the motor
""Bump, bump, bump"" went the brake
""Thump, thump, thump"" went my heartstrings
When he smiled, I could feel the car shake

He tipped his hat, and took a seat
He said he hoped he hadn't stepped upon my feet
He asked my name I held my breath
I couldn't speak because he scared me half to death

""Buzz, buzz, buzz"" went the buzzer
""Plop, plop, plop"" went the wheels
""Stop, stop, stop"" went my heartstrings
As he started to leave I took hold of his sleeve with my hand

And as if it were planned
He stayed on with me and it was grand
Just to stand with his hand holding mine
All the way to the end of the line",The Trolley Song,1994

With the last breath of my soul I'll be blessing you

I meet you and to me the day is fine
Then I kiss your lips, and the pounding becomes
An ocean's roar, a thousand drums
Can't you see it's love? Can there be any doubt?

Sarah Vaughan,"Missed the Saturday dance
Heard they crowded the floor
Couldn't bear it without you
Don't get around much anymore
 
Though I'd visit the club
Got as far as the door
They'd have asked me about you
Don't get around much anymore
 
Darling, I guess my mind's more at ease
But nevertheless why stir up memories?
 
Been invited on dates
Might have gone but what for?
Awf'lly diff'rent without you
Don't get around much anymore",Don't Get Around Much Anymore,2008
Sarah Vaughan,"A country dance was being held in a garden
I felt a bump and heard an ""Oh, beg your pardon""
Suddenly I saw polka dots and moonbeams
All around a pug-nosed dream

The music started and was I the perplexed one
I held my breath and said ""May I have the next one?""
In my frightened arms, polka dots and moonbeams
Sparkled on a pug-nosed dream

There were questions in the eyes of other dancers
As we floated over the floor
There were questions but my heart knew all the answers
And perhaps a few things more

Now in a cottage built of lilacs and laughter
I know the meaning of the words ""Ever after""
And I'll always see polka dots and moonbeams
When I kiss the pug-nosed dream",Polka Dots & Moonbeams,2008
Sarah Vaughan,"There's a silver trail of moonlight leading upward to the sky
And the night is like a velvet lullaby
There's a heaven of blue
And we'll go there, just you and I

Let's build a stairway to the stars
And climb that stairway to the stars
With love beside us to fill the night with a song

We'll hear the sound of violins
Out yonder where the blue begins
The moon will guide us as we go drifting along

Can't we sail away on a lazy daisy petal
Over the rim of the hill?
Can't we sail away on a little dream
And settle high on the crest of a thrill?

Let's build a stairway to the stars
A lovely stairway to the stars
It would be heaven to climb to heaven with you

Sarah Vaughan,"I'm feeling mighty lonesome
Haven't slept a wink
I walk the floor and watch the door
And in between I drink
Black coffee

Love's a hand-me-down brew
I'll never know a Sunday
In this weekday room

I'm talking to the shadows
One o'clock to four
And lord, how slow the moments go
When all I do is pour
Black coffee

Since the blues caught my eye
I'm hanging out on Monday
My Sunday dream's too dry

Now, a man is born to go a-loving
A woman's born to weep and fret
To stay at home and tend her oven
And drown her past regrets
In coffee and cigarettes

I'm moody all the morning
Mourning all the night
And in between, it's nicotine
And not much hard to fight
Black coffee

Feeling low as the ground
It's driving me crazy
Just waiting for my baby
To maybe come around

My nerves have gone to pieces
My hair is turning gray
All I do is drink black coffee
Since my man's gone away",Black Coffee (Disc 01),2008
Sarah Vaughan,"The night is young, the skies are clear 
So if you want to go walking, dear, 
It's delightful, it's delicious, it's de-lovely.

The kind of ditty that invokes the spring. 

I'll control my desire to curse 
While you crucify the verse.

Out of town were the people I knew
I had that feeling of self-pity
What to do, what to do, what to do?
The outlook was decidedly blue

But as I walked through the foggy streets alone
It turned out to be the luckiest day I've known

Had me low, had me down

Could this thing last?

Myself to you body and soul

How faint the tune
Somewhere there's heaven
How high the moon
There is no moon above

Till it comes true
That you love me as I love you

Somewhere there's music
It's where you are
Somewhere there's heaven
How near, how far
The darkest night would shine
If you would come to me soon
Until you will, how still my heart
How high the moon

How high the moon
Is the name of this song
How high the moon
Though the words maybe wrong
We're singin' it because you ask for it
So we're swingin' it just for you

How high the moon
Does it touch the stars
How high the moon
Does it reach out to mars
Though the words maybe wrong to this song
We're askin' how high high high high is the moon

Though the words maybe wrong to that song
We're askin' how high high high high is the moon",How High the Moon,2011
Sarah Vaughn,"As dorothy parker once said
To her boyfriend, ""fare thee well""
As columbus announced
When he knew he was bounced,
""it was swell, isabel, swell""

As abelard said to eloise,
""don't forget to drop a line to me, please""
As juliet cried, in her romeo's ear,
""romeo, why not face the fact, my dear""

Just one of those crazy flings
One of those bells that now and then rings

Just one of those things

If we'd thought a bit, of the end of it
When we started painting the town
We'd have been aware that our love affair
Was too hot, not to cool down

So good-bye, dear, and amen
Here's hoping we meet now and then
It was great fun
But it was just one of those things

Always here, when you sigh,
Never in my woodland could there be words to reveal

Bill and coo when they love?

When we kiss

And there's a weepy old willow
He really knows how to cry
That's how i'd cry in my pillow

There's a land that I've heard of once in a lullaby.

Really do come true.

My true love was true
I of course reply
Something inside
Cannot be denied
They said some day you'll find
All who love are blind
When your heart's on fire
You must realize
Smoke gets in your eyes
So I chaffed them
And I gaily laughed
To think they could doubt
To think they could doubt my love
But today
My love has flown away
I am without my love
Now laughing friends deride
Tears I cannot hide
So I smile and say
When a lovely flame dies
Smoke gets in your eyes
But today my love has flown away
I am without

Sarah Vaughn,"And now the purple dusk of twilight time
Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb
Always reminding me that we're apart
You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms
The nightingale 
Tells his fairytale
Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain
My stardust melody
The memory of love's refrain.",Stardust,2011

That sly come-hither stare
That strips my conscience bare
It's witchcraft

And I've got no defense for it
The heat is too intense for it
What good would common sense for it do?
'Cause it's witchcraft, wicked witchcraft
And although I know it's strictly taboo

Or it might be the sound of your hello
That music I hear
I get misty the moment you're near

You can say that you're leading me on
But it's just what I want you to do
Don't you realize how hopelessly I'm lost
That's why I'm following you

It brings back a night of tropical splendor
It brings back a memory ever green

I'm with you once more under the stars
And down by the shore an orchestra's playing
And even the palms seem to be swaying
When they begin the beguine

To live it again is past all endeavor
Except when that tune clutches my heart
And there we are, swearing to love forever
And promising never, never to part

Till clouds came along to disperse the joys we had tasted
And now when I hear people curse the chance that was wasted
I know but too well what they mean

Let the love that was once a fire remain an ember
Let it sleep like the dead desire I only remember

Till the stars that were there before return above you
Till you whisper to me once more, ""Darling, I love you""

Quand j'entends les cloches qui sonnent
Tout le monde se questionne
Et si la raison m'abandonne
Et bien je me le redis encore

Et même au jour le plus court, la nuit ne tombera jamais
Sous les étoiles et le ciel qui se couvrent ensemble
Ah ah ah ah
Et si le vent qui tourne gonfle nos voiles, nous partirons
Sous la pluie qui s'en mêle et sur le sol qui tremble, décembre, ah

Et malgré le niveau de l'eau qui monte
Il me reste encore la mer à boire
Et si je meurs avant la fin du monde
Et bien je connais déjà l'histoire
Quand j'entends tous les laissés-pour-compte acceptant leur sort
Je connais très bien tout ce qu'ils me racontent
Tous mes amis me le disent encore
Les yeux remplis de glaciers qui fondent
Comme un animal à l'abattoir, traversant l'hécatombe
Je connais déjà la fin de l'histoire
Quand j'entends les armées qui s'affrontent au corps à corps dans le noir
Au son des balles et mastodontes
Sous une pluie de météore

Et même au jour le plus court, la nuit ne tombera jamais
Sous les étoiles et le ciel qui se couvrent ensemble
Ah ah ah ah
Et si le vent qui tourne gonfle nos voiles, nous partirons
Sous la pluie qui s'en mêle et sur le sol qui tremble
Qui tremble, qui tremble, qui tremble

Laisse en bordel derrière toi, c'est plus la peine de ranger
Même si t'as pas fait ton sac, même si rien n'est vraiment prêt
Est-ce que c'est tes jambes ou la Terre entière qui se met à trembler?
Affronte le danger, ou soit raisonnable et cours te planquer
Le froid du grand Nord, piéger dans un dernier temps mort
Inutile de rêver d'encore, attends que l'éternité t'emporte
Oublie l'avenir et ses plans, va dire au revoir à la ville et ses gens
Mais n'ai pas peur de partir en décembre
On s'en ira ensemble

Et même au jour le plus court, la nuit ne tombera jamais
Sous les étoiles et le ciel qui se couvrent ensemble
Ah ah ah ah
Et si le vent qui tourne gonfle nos voiles, nous partirons
Sous la pluie qui s'en mêle et sur le sol qui tremble, décembre, ah",Décembre,
Sarai,"Yeah, yeah mama, we done this before
It's the same ol', same ol', same ol', same ol'
Yeah, yeah mama, we done this before
It's the same ol', same ol', same ol', same ol'

First time you said that you were leaving
I cried ouz you said, you didn't need me
But the second that I started seeing somebody else
That's when ya had to come back to me

Gone continued moving now I'm better
I moved on to someone who would treat me better
But now you're tripping 'cuz you see, I ain't all by myself
And you won't let be me boy

Why you wanna call me on my phone?
Every time you see another boy in my door
Oh boy, you shoulda thought of that before
Now you wanna come home when you're alone
It's the same ol', same ol' sad scenario

Every time you say, you wanna be solo
Oh boy, you shoulda never let me go
But you've done it before
And now I know it's the same ol', same ol'

You thought that you could keep on doing
This to you me like I won't keep on moving
I admit it for a minute, you was having your way
What can I say? I wasn't over you
Things change, you and me, best forget it
(No more games)

And no more playing, I admit it
Don't you get it boy
You take it back tryin' to say like it was yesterday?
But boy we're through
'Cuz you, ain't never really ever cared about me
'Cuz if you ever really cared about me

It wouldn't take another man
To make you understand that you want me
(You want me)
'Cause if you really ever cared about me
You wouldn't have a broken heart, allow me
And now you wanna come back and call me up tonight

Why you wanna call me on my phone?
Every time you see another boy in my door
Oh boy, you shoulda thought of that before
Now you wanna come home when you're alone
It's the same ol', same ol' sad scenario

Every time you say, you wanna be solo
Oh boy, you shoulda never let me go
But you've done it before
And now I know it's the same ol', same ol'

I'm tired of the same ol' games and the same ol' lies
The I'm sorry babies and the lame alabies
Your love had me blind, like Stevie you made me wonder
Was it the love cast spell you had me under

You got me, already she had me
Now that I'm gone, I know that your missing me madly
Now the tables turned no more you and me
Roll with your boys, I'ma roll with P.Y.T

Why you wanna call me on my phone?
Every time you see another boy in my door
Oh boy, you shoulda thought of that before
Now you wanna come home when you're alone
It's the same ol', same ol' sad scenario

Every time you say, you wanna be solo
Oh boy, you shoulda never let me go
But you've done it before
And now I know it's the same ol', same ol'

Why you wanna call me on my phone?
Every time you see another boy in my door
Oh boy, you shoulda thought of that before
Now you wanna come home when you're alone
It's the same ol', same ol' sad scenario

Every time you say, you wanna be solo
Oh boy, you shoulda never let me go
But you've done it before
And now I know it's the same ol', same ol'

Why you wanna call me on my phone?

Sarai,"Questions in mind will I be accepted or not
If not that's fine won't let it hold me down
The mold I'm breakin out stereotypes
Like she can't rip the mic she's white
Get it right come to a show
Come to a session at the studio watch me flow
Watch the record sales watch me blow
Watch me get em all sayin oohh look at her go
It ain't like that at first till I drop that first verse
Then cats eyes pop out like they brain gon burst
Get up in the club bout to rip a show up
They don't even know what I'm there for
Girls be like I can't believe she showed up
What's she doin here who let her in
Don't she see she don't belong yo she don't fit in
I don't fit in anywhere but everywhere at the same time
'Cause all different types of people vibe off the same rhyme

Instead of black and white could it be me and you
Look inside my soul tell me what's visible
Don't put me with the rest I'm an individual
Sometimes the best things lie beyond the physical

People like you aren't supposed to do what you do
People like me what the fuck people like you
That prejudge and can't get beyond the color lines
Corrupt children and they children's minds spread through bloodlines
Hatred is not an instinct
Get some education for ya ass and then tell me what ya think
Learn from those I come in contact watch for attack
Keep my guard up down for combat
Can't back away 'cause they don't see it my way
Or they not used to people like me comin they way
Only hate 'cause people fear the unknown
But fear drive me to take a chance and be bold
Try to knock me down gotta stay on my toes
Prevail winner of the game 'cause they think I'm gon fold
More than you see more than skin and bones
More than blood more than flesh I'm soul

Instead of black and white could it be me and you
Look inside my soul tell me what's visible
Don't put me with the rest I'm an individual
Sometimes the best things lie beyond the physical

Yeah it gets rough being the minority's tough
Yeah there's been times I felt like I had enough
Bout to give up but I held strong
Felt like lettin' go of my dreams but I held on
I can't let anyone stand in my way
Everyone got they opinion I don't care what they say
Out of NY moved to the LI-TH-ONIA down to Ga
Me and my roommate stand out in the complex
Ain't no thing I relate through rhyme contest
Earn my respect through rhymes
Rhymes help me get through times
When ignorant people creep under my skin and get to mines
I don't understand they mind state
Talk about both sides of the board dog they make me irate
Need to pick up a book and work they intellect
And let respect gain respect

Instead of black and white could it be me and you
Look inside my soul tell me what's visible
Don't put me with the rest I'm an individual
Sometimes the best things lie beyond the physical

Ooh what that groove do to ya
Sound so sick through the stereo 
Flamin' out the box scaldin' hot

Edgy pop lil' rock wit that real hip hop
'Til ya body drop gotta pause to breathe 
Got those that didn't believe rockin' wit me now

See I ain't pressed for the spot light 
Camera keep flashin' while I'm stuck at the stop light
Yo what the hell just happened 
All ya'll followin' me just for rappin'
Dam I got the world in a frenzy
Haters goin' envy that don't offend me
Wit' ya little attitude please don't tempt me
Get ya gassed just to leave ya tank empty

Rockin' gold in they mouth
Kingston upstate New York 
Lil' place up North where the style is raw
Hit me up 2-way or the celli

Comin' to a party near you 
No matter where I go its about what I do

Fa lahh, fa lahh

[Verse One]
It all started like this; 9th grade, freshman year
So happy to be in high school I shedded a tear
So many cute dudes to choose from, I knew it was one
that was, right for me, well I thought at least
He was the big guy on campus on the football team
Basketball; homecoming, he was voted for King
There was me, I was on the cheerleading squad
Sweet sixteen, lookin for love in my heart
It was a, beautiful thing from the start I must say
Only problem, my parents were strict, they ain't play
No phone calls after 8, no stayin out late
I'm like daaaaamn, gimme a break
Hormones kickin in, start displayin my shape
More concerned with my looks than my books and grades
Headed nowhere fast, I was on my way
Curiosity, c'mon, I know y'all relate

[Chorus]
Think about the characters in my storybook
The pages I have read you
This ain't your momma's fairytale
The things that I have been through
In all my life, and all my days
I ne-ver thought I would end up this way

[Verse Two]
It's been a year now I'm a sophomore, maturin no more
Still I'm young and dumb and plus I'm unsure
who I am what the future has in store
Man I'm tryin to be grown cause my parents now divorced
I took a charge to roll with Dough Boy
Moms tried to force me to move to New York
But of course, that plan it fell short
She found herself caught up in court on child support
Drama, problems of all sorts
Stressin started smokin Newports
Carefree, about the ones who care for me
Lost teen, givin up on my dreams, and as worst as that seems
had me thinkin crazy things like suicide
Like it'd better everything if, I just die
Full blown, without guidance or a home
I'm startin to get stomach pains, that's strange, what could be wrong?

[Chorus]

[Verse Three]
What do I do, I ask myself, everyday
A child givin birth to a child, what can I say?
This wasn't 'posed to happen to me, no way
Hear I am, turned my back on my fam, well GOD DAMN
Wasn't even part of the plan, I'm spazzin out
I lay down at night, the hurt just burst out
I shout - how could he leave at my time of need?
'Specially now I'm pregnant and due in three?
Maybe, I should have it and give it up for adoption
I can't graduate, I ain't been to school since August
Often I hear this voice talkin in the back of my mind
So many problems in my life
I just pray for my time to come
God take me leave my child behind, I'm on the run
Adrenaline pumpin so angry, I could kill some'n
Don't make me prove it cause if you don't do it then I'ma do it
I'm foolish and so STUPID!

[Chorus] - repeat 2X to fade",It's Not a Fairytale,2003
Sarai,"It's been along time comin locked in the lab wit a infa-red pen and a pad
 A lot of chicks in tha game sound da same can't switch they style an they making me laugh
 They tickle me like (ha,ha,ha) it ain't that hard spit raw 16 bars
 don't make me have to pull your card rip it apart get'em shocked like they all seen god
 I got'em stuck amazed lost in a daze cause the pen don't stop for days
 4 weeks 4 years I keep it movin driven by fears never losin
 Playin 2 win the game I'm in making they head spin
 Industry was needin me like emphysema patients need oxygen
 Cop whips off the the lots again rockin all spots I'm in 
 North, South, East, West overseas and back again
 DJ's fiend for the wax 2 spin some of ya'll gon need some practicin 
 Got everybody in the world sayin damn that's Sarai on the track again
 
 This is how it's gon be I've been workin hard 
 For this puttin in all I got I'm a be a star for this
 Yo pardon Miss. excuse me but you got to make way
 I ain't new to this stay true to this been doin this since back in the day
 I been puttin in work writing so much that my whole head start to hurt 
 Up so late fall asleep hands on my face so tell me what its worth 
 (It's Official) I stepped on you fell off and the don't miss you 
 Bomb shit like missiles while you rip easy like wet tissues
 Issues you got to deal wit phenomenal styles is how I sealed it
 Hot flows hot beats I know you got to feel it
 I keeps it real wit everything I do don't have to pull tha front for you 
 No they can't believe they ears how she spit the way she do
 It's official
 
 You know how much time I spent at home 
 writing rhymes fiending for a microphone
 Like Eric be	 & Rakim I had dreams to move the crowd 
 get everybody rockin one shot wit tha infa-red dot hit you right in tha pocket
 Haters will try & block it but there's just no way to stop it
 Go slow fast fiction or fact go ahead pick your topic 
 when the fire ignites I hop on the flight headed to tha top just like rockets
 I'm dedicated finally made it y'all don't know how long I've been waited
 Mrs. Strawberry blonde wanted it bad so you know I'm about to get it on
 (get it on)
 
 It's been so long I've waited
 And I can't believe that I
 Finally made it 
 It was all a dream till I
 Dedicated
 My life to tha game so you can

Sarai,"Once again standin' here cryin out
 Energy gone my insides dyin' out
 Wishin' you was dead or somewhere lyin' out
 Every time you open ya mouth lies flyin' out
 Remember when we first met you wit' ya crew
 Me wit' my girls doin' what we usually do
 You wit' ya game comin' at me askin' my name
 Knew it was love first sight you said it the same 
 Talked on the phone the whole night vibe feelin' so right
 Every step pointin' to love the future so bright 
 Till this girl in my class told me she was pregnant 
 And that you was the dad
 How she wasn't jealous of me or nothin' I had 
 How you cheated on her several times and treated her bad
 And as she was tellin' me that my whole world collapsed
 Feelin' like a fool still in love wit' you
 
 [Chorus (2x):]
 Mommy always told me 'bout life Life never plays to be nice
 Tragedy's all in my life
 Love is what destroyed my life, life
 
 What tricks you gon' play now 
 Nothin' you could say 'cause everything is clear now 
 I can see where I made my mistakes 
 Stayin' home a good girlfriend gimmie a break 
 I'd be home alone callin' you catchin' the shakes
 Every minute till you call back adrealine raced
 Left me hangin' on my birthday when I stayed at ya place 
 You came home the next morning
 I just stared in ya face
 Knew where you was actin' dumb it tore me apart
 Took it out on your things put the key to your car
 Felt like you had a knife all this pain in my heart
 Deep down though still wishin' we could restart
 For a second I was on top swore I had the cream
 Rude awakeing nothin' come to sleepers but a dream 
 It's sinkin' in never really loved me and it seemed 
 What was I thinking I was only in my teens
 
 [Chorus (2x):]
 Mommy always told me 'bout life Life never plays to be nice
 Tragedy's all in my life
 Love is what destroyed my life, life
 
 Nowadays when I see you I don't feel bad
 Got a real love in my life you be a real dad
 For once in ya life try doin' somethin' right
 By now you should be ready to slow it down
 'cause you know what go 'round come back 'round
 Even though it hurt to let you go I had to roll
 A demon in disguise you was tryna take my soul
 Couldn't make a move you was tryna take control
 In a way I could only balme myself naive
 I made the choice to be wit' you and no one else indeed
 A picture in a broken frame upon the shelf indeed
 Had to take a lil' time to know myself 
 Every now and then and then I start to reminisce wantin' ya kiss
 Even though I know it's dangerous 
 Every now and then I start to reminisce 
 For real even though I know it's so dangerous
 
 [Chorus (4x):]
 Mommy always told me 'bout life Life never plays to be nice
 Tragedy's all in my life
 Love is what destroyed my life, life
 
 [Jaguar:]
 What a chick gotta do to get some love?
 What I gotta do to say enough is enough?
 
 What's the point of bein' wit somebody, that only bring ya down
 Goin 'round and 'round

 Mommy always told me 'bout life Life never plays to be nice

Hey Mr. DJ, turn the music up loud
And everybody report to the dancefloor now
Line 'em up cause we bouts to get down
Off the chain like they do it in the South
Everybody just havin a good time
Got my eyes on the guys that's here, they so fine
That's right, Sarai can get it krunk
How much junk you got in that trunk?
Come out the house, get on the street
Hear Cee-Lo, let out the 'Closet Freak'
Act a fool, you can do what you want
Get loose cause the track be that funk
Groove to the bump

Make the truck wobble with an extra bounce
Make it touch the ground and then RAISE IT UP
Like the garbage men do it with the dump truck

Throw it up, get krunk

Slim or big-boned, don't matter yo' size
Don't matter if you black or white

How many of y'all the same color inside
So why divide?  I mean there's no reason why

That's fo'sho yo please believe
I'ma stay bein me ain't no changin me

Shake that shit like how you love dat

Sarai,"Bring it on back to the young days when things wasn't so hard
 Playin kickball in the school yard
 The year before kindergarten when memories started at the day care
 All the Little kids used to play there
 We had no worries just hated nap time but fingerpaintin' and playin' tag was fine
 And we would all run around except for this girl
 She stayed in the corner, Yeah her name was Mary Anne
 She missed half of the school days scince the year began
 Never wore a shirt that showed more than her hands
 She rockin' jeans & Long sleeves in like 90 degrees
 You know lil' kids they treat her like she got a disease
 Came in 1 day all her hair was gone
 Said her mamma cut it off cause she did something wrong
 Tears in her eyes when she finally said somethin 
 Usually she would get scared and wouldn't say nothin
 
 Days that went by, she had to cry, wonder why did it happen to me
 Day after day, she slipped away, wonder why did it happen to me
 
 Elementary she got the seat next to me
 Lucky i wasn't mean like the rest could be
 She treated like an outcast wonder how long she could outlast
 Bein alienated by the whole class
 It was still touch and go with the whole school scenario
 In for days out for weeks still scared to speak
 I wonder if that one time she had tried to tell and the teacher shrugged her off like Oh Well
 I wonder if that shut her down
 Maybe she had no one to turn to
 Maybe this little girl didn't know what to do
 We had a project one week me and Mary Anne a team
 So i invited her to my house for ice cream
 She bangin on the door at the house invite her to sit on the couch 
 She looked me in the eyes
 Mary Anne began to cry
 I said what's wrong she said she wanted someone to tell her why
 
 Days that went by, she had to cry,
 wonder why did it happen to me
 Day after day she slipped away, wonder why did it happen to me
 
 After that incident she didn't really  want to talk to me
 I'd see her in the hall 
 Call out but she wouldn't walk with me
 Junior high she got cover up caked up
 You could see the bruises underneath the make - up
 Stories to make up people askin question now
 She breakin down but still no confessions now
 She walk around dazed out lost in another land spaced out
 And as days go by she grows more distant
 Teachers barely aware of her existence
 She in and out more out than in
 And one day i'm in class
 The ambulance pass screechin
 Down by the artroom off to the right in the bathroom
 They found Mary Anne on the floor
 A bottle next to her 
 Said she took like 50 pills or more
 And left a note that said she couldnt handle it no more
 
 Days that went by, she had to cry,
 wonder why did it happen to me
 Day after day she slipped away, wonder why did it happen to me",Mary Anne,2003

 Probably chilly-chilly-chill till the time is right
 That I feely-feely-feel I need a man in my life
 But for now I'mma keep it tight
 Till I burst under pressure when my temperature rise
 I'm on the women's pride, feel me right

 How your mind in a bind goin' out of control

 How many dimes you done dropped the same lines to
 Played games and lied to got inside ooh
 Don't even want to think about it
 Somebody tried to tell me all them games you played around wit'
 You tellin the truth doubt it
 Did you ever really keep it real when it counted
 I release myself and roll out
 Said ya'd never lie but ya sold out
 Before ya know it I'm gone
 With short notice 'cause I played them games way too long
 I'm movin on movin up movin out
 Sit and think about why you losin out
 Missed ya chance to experience real romance
 Now I'm workin the club while you save the last dance
 Standin there wit' ya hand out
 Had me fooled for a minute but time just ran out
 
 [Chorus:]
 Ay yo I swear to you Sarai what up I would never dare lie
 OK I believe you
 Swear to you Sarai you the only girl in my life
 OK I believe you
 
 [Verse 2:]
 
 Yeah OK I believe you better get it through your thick head
 That I don't need you
 Phone calls wit' the hang-up
 Or it's ya boys wit' an invite to a chick's house you could go gang up
 Tag team hittin girls from rag team
 The rat heads boost ya ego to a fat head
 Comin wit' lies I don't deserve saw you as the center of my earth
 I see you know just dirt
 What's it worth for me to stick around and see you lie
 Right to my face and it's supposed to be alright
 Well it's not and I've had enough
 Hit the whammy dog should've stopped pressin your luck
 I used be like what's up baby now I'm like what
 Used to drive me crazy now I'm just nuts
 Used to want to hear you talk now I'm like shut up
 Used to care now I don't give a fuck
 
 [Chorus Repeat]
 
 [Hook:]
 
 I would never lie to you-Stop
 Never lie to you-Please
 Never lie to you-OK-never never never
 
 So I'm the only one right
 Well who keep pagin you at like 2 every night
 Claim I'm the love of your life well how it go
 Out of mind when you out of sight so
 When I step away it's like the wifey get away
 You start spittin game askin for the number and name of every dame
 That walk by so I dead it see the chalk line
 Hop on hers you off mine now if ya don't mind
 I got somewhere to be
 That'd be anywhere that you're not next to me
 I have no desire to waste my time on liars
 Kill all the noise like a hitman for hire
 You had it let it go now ya want this
 Gotta break out leave ya heart broke like ya promise 
 I could've forgiven you everyone makes mistakes
 But I only deal wit real and you fake

Forget what mama told me as a little girl
Bout to get grown, get on, and rock yo' world
Your body tellin my body how your song goes
While you smackin my bum-bum like your bongos
Ride it like Tonto, I'll be your sidekick
The sweetest sang when the mouth silent
When you doin what you doin get to movin the tongue, tornado
""OH I AIN'T IN KANSAS NO MORE!""
I ain't no hoe, no whore, I deserve a reward
Waterbed make waves like the seashore
I see more in you, than the average Joe
So you don't see the trash where the average go
It ain't standard, to have a dude in my clutch
Sometimes I buck, HOLD ON, the ride gets rough
I feel I must, touch the A+
Double barrel gun baby, we both bust

[Chorus]
You make me feel like DANCIN
When you get to ROMANCIN me
Make me want to SING so SWEET
Body to body I feel ya heat
Ya make me want to FREAK OUT
Ain't no way I'm goin home, lonely
Make me feel like SWEATIN, FORGETTIN
E-everything my mama told me

[Verse Two]
You and the liquor got my eyes blurrin
And when you licka the kitten for certain, she get to purrin
Ridin the wave you got me surfin, eatin what I'm servin
I'll play the game, show me what's behind the curtain
All the slurrin got me urgin, to get the work in
Bodies mergin, hot like chicken jerkin
X-Rated version, me and this person
Gettin down in the dirt and grabbin his shirt and his jeans
Perkin, have him hittin high notes like MC, in +Fantasy+
Could it be you and me on the +Island+ whylin
You down low like you deep-sea divin
Worlds collidin, emotions explodin
Juices flowin, the climax approachin
Face soakin that number nine potion
You need some winnin plays, get me to coachin

[Chorus]

[Verse Three]
I think I might, try-why to get this fly guy
in my, ri-ide, hop in the 7-4-5-i-i
Take you places you ain't never seen
Can you keep your cool if I whip until you cream
Don't mean to be obscene, put the children to bed
Thugs like N.O.R.E., in the whip gettin ""he'd""
What I said like Keyshaun, I'm the receiver
Gwan' try me, testify, you a believer
You never up and leave her
Stay on call, Dr. Dutch, master of it all
Move slow like the Southern drawl
And make it quick like the N.Y.C. cats spit
OH SHIT!

Four-four caliber tongue, you want some?
Let me know, K.O. flows, ya gots none
Let me know, that you don't speak 'til I'm done
And ya know, double-S straight to ya chest
Storch and Sarai, now who the best?
He's all I work with y'all, nuttin less
Infra-Red's the click I rep to the death
Hold tight, see light ya just might
Back hand like Van Damme all on the mic stand
.. go off like Lara Croft
Fire hair, hard body, killin you so soft
Like it better when they turn the lights off
Get gone, get in the zone, let's get it on
It's a shame, you was smilin when you came
Cryin when you left, what, thought it was a game?
c'mon

[Chorus]
No matter what they say, I'm just gon' do my thing
Straight up hurt this game, y'all know you could never hold me
Though they hate a lot, I still come out on top
Try to take my spot, y'all know you could never hold me

[Verse Two]
I got, nuttin but hits that's hot
Came in at the top from the first single dropped
I'm everything that yo' not, takin yo' spot
I Sarai be the sho' shot
Soon as I stepped on stage I blow spots
Got Liberace feelin my ghost, I glow rocks
Sparklin baby, like Perrier pop
Got demos at the crib that ain't never been copped
Better, when they put me under pressure
The secret weapon, I'm the hidden treasure
Diamond in the rough, carats beyond measure
Bars I drop for y'all, my pleasure
Hoodie or the high heels, whatever is whatever
Videos with the ass hangin out, never
Can't see a dime from here, yo listen
Get a prescription, holla at Pearle Vision

Does the passion burn in your heart?
Is your mind starting to understand?

This challenge that's thrown upon us
We need to struggle to learn to survive
Only once in a lifetime you feel it
This must be our time to thrive

Do you know how long you can take it?
Are you willing to take the chance?
Do you know if you really believe it?
Are you sure you can last?

As the night settles down upon us
The moon shining bright tonight
You look up to heaven for guidance
And ask yourself if the timing's right

Can you believe for one second that you've made it?
Are you sure you can play their game?

You're not sure you'll ever be the same

Kept them inside and felt so proud!

Felt like such a man
Told myself that's what I am

But frail on the inside

But then I fell for you
I had nothing to prove
But my heart was so moved
Knew from the moment??

My heart cries to you
My heart begs for you
My heart flies to you
My heart bleeds for you??

Why does my heart feel this way
Why do I feel this way?
No logical reason that I know of
But I still wanna stay

Stay with you, stand next to you, 
Even when you're blue girl
I wanna hold you, 
Put you in my arms and shelter you
You know I'd die for you, I'd lie for you
I'd do anything for you

Don't ever leave me alone, 
I don't wanna feel alone
I also don't wanna feel the fear, 
Of being left behind

No one there to see
No one there but me
Please keep that heartache away from me
I'm so scared to feel that pain

If I lose you, 
I'd lose the only love I ever truly had
And that would make my heart hurt so bad
And I would feel so mad
And so so sad, so sad

Why?

Because my heart wants to do
Everything for you
It wants to prove
My love for you

That's why
That's why
That's why",Why,
Sarantos,"They say it's the most wonderful time of the year
I say it's surely a time filled with cheer
Some people say it's usually a silent night
I say Christmas always makes me feel so right

It's Christmas time again
An easy time to enjoy a friend
It's a time that's so special to us
With time honored traditions we simply trust

It's truly the happiest time of the year
So special and so full of cheer
A time to be with my friends
A time to say sorry and make amends
Will you be happy with me?
It's a very simple time you must see
Let us remember who we truly are
Mere mortals with a gentle heart

Over the hills some people go
Others love to play in the snow
Sledding around for all to see
Some kids even throw snowballs at Frosty

It's just a time I'm eager to treasure
All kids I hope have no displeasure
A simple happy time of the year
For Santa to give them some cheer

It's truly the happiest time of the year
So special and so full of cheer

I wanna build a snowman
I wanna buy some presents
I wait up all night for Santa

Oh yeah
Oh yeah!
Yeah

They say you could hear the angels sing
They sang for little Jesus our king
And although three wise men did appear
Yet little baby Jesus Mary still held dear

And Jesus was finally here and all was right
Christmas was born on that cold fateful night
A tradition was begun that we've come to love
That moment God set in motion from up above

It's truly the happiest time of the year
So special and so full of cheer
A time to be with my friends
A time to say sorry and make amends

Will you be happy with me?
It's a very simple time you must see
Let us remember who we truly are
Mere mortals with a gentle heart

Once again it's snowing, outside
I look out my window with cheer

Once again I feel so, peaceful
Memories as a child flood my mind

Snow is falling softly, outside
Out in the cold I look up to the sky
Yet I'm feeling cozy, tonight
Such a feeling I can't deny

As the night takes over, the skyline
This scene is such a treasured sight
And I'm happy for all that is mine

On this quiet night
A miracle was received
Earth was saved and stepped into the light
A little baby made the whole world believe

On this simple night
I feel the emptiness of my soul
I'm at peace with everything in spite
Of knowing how it all unfolds

On this night
I think of you
I want to thank you
For what you went through
On this night
I remember it all
What you did for me
And I will always stand tall

On this peaceful night
You are a sight to behold
The moon is smiling bright
A little baby's story begins to be told

On this beautiful night
My world becomes instantly full of hope
I get on my knees and pray and act polite
'Cause now I don't feel the cold

Shh

Don't make a sound
Listen and you will hear it

On this uncomplicated night
A passive mood with no one to warn
The manger is a proud site
Where this little baby was born

On this tranquil night
I hear your cry and it touches my soul
I feel your comfort and your might
And now I don't feel so alone

On this night
I think of you
I want to thank you
For what you went through
On this,
On this night
I remember it all
What you did for me
And I will always stand tall

Something in your eyes I see
Soon begins bewitching me
It's that old devil moon
That you stole from the skies

Too hot to handle
Stars in the night
Blazing their light
Can't hold a candle
To your razzle-dazzle

You've got me flyin' high and wide
On a magic carpet ride
Full of butterflies inside
Wanna cry, wanna croon
Wanna laugh like a loon

Quemar
