Mariah Carey,"Soft heavenly eyes gazed into me
Transcending space and time
And I was a rendered still
There were no words for me to find at all
As I stood there beside myself
I could see you and no one else

When I saw you
When I saw you
I could not breathe
I fell so deep, oh oh
When I saw you
When I saw you
I'd never be
I'd never be a same

Only once in a lifetime love rushes in
Changin' you with a tide
And dawn's ribbon of light
Bursts through the dark
Wakening you inside
And I thought it was all untrue
Until there, all at once, I knew

When I saw you
When I saw you
I could not breathe
I fell so deep, oh oh
When I saw you
When I saw you
I'd never be
I'd never be the same

With no beginning
And without an end
You are the one for me
And it's evident
And your eyes told me so, oh oh yeah
Your eyes let me know, oh oh oh

When I saw you
When I saw you
I could not breathe,
I fell so deep, oh oh
When I saw you
When I saw you
I'd never be
I'd never be a same

Oh no
Never be the same",When I Saw You,1995
Mariah Carey,"Oh, when you walk by every night
Talking sweet and looking fine
I get kinda hectic inside
Mmm, baby I'm so into you
Darling, if you only knew
All the things that flow through my mind

But it's just a sweet sweet fantasy baby
When I close my eyes
You come and you take me
It's so deep in my daydreams
But it's just a sweet, sweet fantasy baby

Images of rapture
Creep into me slowly
As you're going to my head
And my heart beats faster
When you take me over
Time and time and time again

But it's just a sweet sweet fantasy baby
When I close my eyes
You come and you take me
It's so deep in my daydreams
But it's just a sweet, sweet fantasy baby

Sweet sweet fantasy baby
When I close my eyes
You come and you take me
It's so deep in my daydreams
But it's just a sweet, sweet fantasy baby

I'm in heaven
With my boyfriend
My laughing boyfriend
There's no beginning
And there is no end
Feels like I'm dreaming
But I'm not sleeping

Sweet sweet fantasy baby
When I close my eyes
You come and you take me
It's so deep in my daydreams
But it's just a sweet, sweet fantasy baby

Sweet sweet fantasy baby
When I close my eyes
You come and you take me
It's so deep in my daydreams
But it's just a sweet, sweet fantasy baby

Sweet sweet fantasy baby",Fantasy [Album Version],1995
Mariah Carey,"There's a hero
If you look inside your heart
You don't have to be afraid
Of what you are
There's an answer
If you reach into your soul
And the sorrow that you know
Will melt away

And then a hero comes along
With the strength to carry on
And you cast your fears aside
And you know you can survive
So when you feel like hope is gone
Look inside you and be strong
And you'll finally see the truth
That a hero lies in you

It's a long road  
When you face the world alone
No one reaches out a hand
For you to hold
You can find love
If you search within yourself
And that emptiness you felt  
Will disappear

And then a hero comes along
With the strength to carry on
And you cast your fears aside
And you know you can survive
So when you feel like hope is gone
Look inside you and be strong
And you'll finally see the truth
That a hero lies in you, oh, oh

Lord knows
Dreams are hard to follow
But don't let anyone
Tear them away, hey yeah 
Hold on
There will be tomorrow
In time you'll find the way

And then a hero comes along
With the strength to carry on
And you cast your fears aside
And you know you can survive
So when you feel like hope is gone
Look inside you and be strong
And you'll finally see the truth
That a hero lies in you
That a hero lies in you
Mmm, that a hero lies in you",Hero,1995
Mariah Carey,"Sorry I never told you
All I wanted to say
Now it's too late to hold you
'Cause you've flown away
So far away

Never had I imagined
Living without your smile
Feeling and knowing you hear me
It keeps me alive
Alive

And I know you're shining down on me from heaven
Like so many friends we've lost along the way
And I know eventually we'll be together
One sweet day

Darling I never showed you
Assumed you'd always be there
I, I took your presence for granted
But I always cared
And I miss the love we shared

And I know you're shining down on me from heaven
Like so many friends we've lost along the way
And I know eventually we'll be together

You called yesterday to basically say
That you care for me

Nonchalant about it

I'm fine without you

So what do you do
When somebody you're so devoted to
Suddenly just stops loving you
And it seems they haven't got a clue
Of the pain that rejection is putting you through
Do you cling to your pride

Do you hold on in vain as they just slip away

But in reality I'm slowly losing my mind
Underneath a disguise of a smile
Gradually I'm dying inside
Friends ask me how I feel
And I lie convincingly
'Cause I don't want to reveal
The fact that I'm suffering
So I wear my disguise
'Til I go home at night
And turn down all the lights
And then I break down and cry

So what do you do
When somebody you're so devoted to
Suddenly just stops loving you
And it seems they haven't got a clue
Of the pain that rejection is putting you through
Do you cling to your pride
And sing ""I will survive""
Do you lash out and say ""How dare you leave this way?""
Do you hold on in vain as they just slip away

Well I guess I'm trying to be
Nonchalant about it
And I'm going to extremes to prove
I'm fine without you
But in reality I'm slowly losing my mind
Underneath the disguise of a smile
Gradually I'm dying inside
Friends ask me how I feel
And I lie convincingly
'Cause I don't want to reveal
The fact that I'm suffering
So I wear my disguise
'Til I go home at night
And turn down all the lights
And then I break down and cry

It'll break you down
Only if you let it
Everyday crazy situations rocking my mind
Tryin' to break me down
But I won't let it, forget it (Forget it)

I be feelin' like you bringing me down
Taking me around
Stressin' me out
I think I better go and get out
And let me release some stress (Stress)

Don't ever wanna feel no pain (Pain)
Hoping for the sun but it looks like rain (Rain, rain, rain)
Lord, I just wanna maintain

Yeah, I can feel pressures y'all
But nevertheless Krayzie won't fall
It's over, it's ending here (Here)

Mariah Carey,"When you love someone so deeply
They become your life
It's easy to succumb to overwhelming fears inside
Blindly I imagined I could
Keep you under glass
Now I understand to hold you
I must open up my hands
And watch you rise

Spread your wings and prepare to fly
For you have become a butterfly, oh
Fly abandonedly into the sun
If you should return to me
We truly were meant to be
So spread your wings and fly
Butterfly

I have learned that beauty
Has to flourish in the light
Wild horses run unbridled
Or their spirit dies
You have given me the courage
To be all that I can
And I truly feel your heart will
Lead you back to me when you're
Ready to land

Spread your wings and prepare to fly
For you have become a butterfly, oh
Fly abandonedly into the sun
If you should return to me
We truly were ment to be
So spread your wings and fly
Butterfly, butterfly

I can't pretend these tears
Aren't over flowing steadily
I can't prevent this hurt from
Almost overtaking me
But I will stand and say goodbye
For you'll never be mine
Until you know the way it feels to fly

Spread your wings and prepare to fly
For you have become a butterfly, oh
Fly abandonedly into the sun
If you should return to me
We truly were meant to be
So spread your wings and fly
Butterfly

Spread your wings and prepare to fly
For you have become a butterfly, oh
Fly abandonedly into the sun
If you should return to me

So flutter through the sky

Mariah Carey,"I was wayward child 
With the weight of the world 
That I held deep inside 
Life was a winding road 
And I learned many things 
Little ones shouldn't know 

But I closed my eyes 
Steadied my feet on the ground 
Raised my head to the sky 
And though time's rolled by 
Still feel like that child 
As I look at the moon 
Maybe I grew up 
A little too soon 

Funny how one can learn 
To grow numb to the madness 
And block it away 
I left the worst unsaid 
Let it all dissipate 
And I try to forget 

But I closed my eyes 
Steadied my feet on the ground 
Raised my head to the sky 
And though time's rolled by 
Still feel like that child 
As I look at the moon 
Maybe I grew up 
A little too soon 

Nearing the edge 
Oblivious I almost 
Fell right over 
A part of me 
Will never be quite able 
To feel stable 
That woman-child falling inside 
Was on the verge of fading 
Thankfully I 
Woke up in time 

Guardian angel I 
Sail away on an ocean 
With you by my side 
Orange clouds roll by 
They burn into your image 
And you're still alive 

But I closed my eyes 
Steadied my feet on the ground 
Raise my head to the sky 
And though time rolls by 
Still feel like a child 
As I look at the moon 
Maybe I grew up 
A little too soon",Close My Eyes,1997

Mariah Carey,"Trembling 
Starry eyed 
As you put your hand in mine

It was twilight 
On the Fourth of July 
Sparkling colors were 
Strewn across the sky 
And we sat close enough 
That we just barely touched 
While roman candles 
Went soaring above us and baby 

Then you put your hand in mine 
And we wandered away 
I was trembling inside 
But I wanted to stay 
Pressed against you there and leave the world behind 
On that Fourth of July 

So starry eyed (so starry eyed)
On the flowery hillside 
Breathless and fervid 
Amid the dandelions 
As it swept over me 
Like the wind trough the trees 
I felt you sigh with a 
Sweet intensity and baby 

Then you put your hand in mine (your hand in mine)
And we floated away 
Delicately lay entwined 
In an intimate daze 
A crescent moon began to shine (began to shine)
And I wanted to stay (stay)
Tangled up with you among the fireflies 
On that Fourth of July (Fourth of July)

Thunder clouds (thunder clouds)
Hung around (hung around)
So threateningly (so threateningly)
Ominously hovering 
And the sky (the sky)
Opened wide (opened wide)
Showering (oh yeah yeah9

Then you put your hand in mine (put your hand in mine)
And we ran from the rain (in the pouring rain, baby)
Tentatively kissed goodnight (tentatively kissed goodnight)
And went our separate ways (ways)
And I've never truly felt the way that I 
Felt the Fourth of July (Fourth of July, Fourth of July)

Truly I have never felt the same inside 
Like that Fourth of July (Fourth of July, Fourth of July)
Truly I could never feel the same as I 
Felt that Fourth of July (Fourth of July), oh baby",Fourth of July,1997
Mariah Carey,"I am thinking of you
In my sleepless solitude tonight
If it's wrong to love you
Then my heart just won't let me be right
'Cause I've drowned in you
And I won't pull through
Without you by my side

I'd give my all to have
Just one more night with you
I'd risk my life to feel
Your body next to mine
'Cause I can't go on
Living in the memory of our song
I'd give my all for your love tonight

Baby can you feel me
Imagining I'm looking in your eyes
I can see you clearly
Vividly emblazoned in my mind
And yet you're so far
Like a distant star
I'm wishing on tonight

I'd give my all to have
Just one more night with you
I'd risk my life to feel
Your body next to mine

Tonight",My All,1997
Mariah Carey,"It's hard to explain 
Inherently it's just always been strange 
Neither here nor there 
Always somewhat out of place everywhere 
Ambiguous 
Without a sense of belonging to touch 
Somewhere halfway 
Feeling there's no one completely the same 

Standing alone 
Eager to just 
Believe it's good enough to be what 
You really are 
But in your heart 
Uncertainty forever lies 
And you'll always be 
Somewhere on the 
Outside 

Early on, you face 
The realization you don't 
Have a space 
Where you fit in 
And recognize you 
Were born to exist 

Standing alone 
Eager to just 
Believe it's good enough to be what 
You really are 
But in your heart 
Uncertainty forever lies 
And you'll always be 
Somewhere on the 
Outside 

And it's hard 
And it's hard 
And it's hard 

Irreversibly 
Falling in between 
And it's hard
And it's hard
To be understood 
As you are 
As you are

Oh, and God knows 
That you're standing on your own 
Blind and unguided 
Into a world divided 
You're thrown 
Where you're never quite the same 
Although you try, try and try 
To tell yourself 
You really are 
But in your heart uncertainty forever lies 
And you'll always be 
Somewhere on the outside

You'll always be
Somewhere on the outside

Oh, oh, yeah, oh, oh, yeah
It wasn't raining yet 
But it was definitely 
A little misty on 
That warm November night 
And my heart was pounding 
My inner voice resounding 
Begging me to turn away 
But I just had to see your face 
To feel alive 
And then you casually walked in the room 
And I was twisted in the web 
Of my desire for you 
My apprehension blew away 
I only wanted you 
To taste my sadness 
As you kissed me in the dark 

Every time I feel the need 
I envision you caressing me 
And go back in time 
To relieve the splendor of you and I 
On the rooftop that rainy night 

And so we finished the Moet and 
Started feeling liberated 
And I surrendered as you took me 
In your arms 
I was so caught up in the moment 
I couldn't bear to let you go yet 
So I threw caution to the wind 
And started listening to my longing heart 
And then you softly pressed your lips to mine 
And feelings surfaced I'd suppressed 
For such a long time 
And for a while I forgot 
The sorrow and the pain 
And melted with you as we stood 
There in the rain 

Every time I feel the need 
I envision you caressing me 
And go back in time 
To relieve the splendor of you and I 
On the rooftop that rainy night 
Every time I feel the need 
I envision you caressing me 
And go back in time 
To relieve the splendor of you and I 
On the rooftop that rainy night 

Last night I dreamed that I 
Whispered the words I love you 
And touched you so very 
Subtly as we were kissing goodbye 
Pretty baby, how I'm missing you

Every time I feel the need 
I envision you caressing me 
And go back in time 
To relieve the splendor of you and I 
On the rooftop that rainy night 

Every time I feel the need 
I envision you caressing me 
And go back in time 
To relieve the splendor of you and I 
On the rooftop that rainy night 
 
Every time I feel the need 
I envision you caressing me

Tell me you want my love
Baby please don't deny what your feeling inside
Say you've been thinking of
Holding me, Touching me, Filling my every needs

Head over Heels
it seems so real
It feels like I'm falling in love
I'm lost inside 
You're my desire
Oh baby can't you see 
I'm falling for you head over heels

Baby, Baby I'm longing,
just to have you to myself
I don't want nobody else
Baby my body's calling
Won't you come get my love
because I really need you so much

Tell me you want me love 
baby please don't deny

So what's the problem
You know you like the way I act
You been around real cats 
all your life since way back
you still got it cause you was turned out once
guess you learned ain't no future with them burnt out stunts
Left the hood to get your own thing 
with home team
Pushin through watchin gleam, 
Yeah I-ight you probably heard 
that my pipe game tight
rockin PBS stones powerful whips with egg headlights
scent of weed gettin all in your weave
I put out the trees 
and crack the moon roof 
only for you to breath 
You get an extra set of keys
I tell the world while I'm out on tour
Keep your hands off my girls
Allure!

Say you've been thinkin of
I'm falling for you head over heels

Yeah, yeah, Infamous, knock 'em out the box, yo
I got you stuck off the realness
Infamous, knock 'em out the box
I got you stuck off the realness

It wasn't raining yet but it was definitely
A little misty on that warm November night
And my heart was pounding my inner voice resounding
Begging me to turn away but I just had to see your face to feel alive

And then you casually walked into the room
And I was twisted in the web of my desire for you
My apprehension blew away, I only wanted you
To taste my sadness as you kissed me in the dark

Every time makes feel the need
I envision you caressing me
And go back in time to relieve the splendor
Of you and I on the rooftop that rainy night

And so we finished the Moet and started feeling liberated
And I surrendered as you took me in your arms
I was so caught up in the moment, I couldn't bear to let you go yet
Threw caution to the wind and started listening to my longing heart

And then you softly pressed your lips to mine
And feelings surfaced I'd suppressed for such a long time
And for a while I forgot the sorrow and pain
And melted with you as we stood there in the rain

Every time I feel the need
I envision you caressing me
And go back in time to relieve the splendor
Of you and I on the rooftop that rainy night

Every time I feel the need
I envision you caressing me
And go back in time to relieve the splendor
Of you and I on the rooftop that rainy night

Last night I dreamed that I
Whispered the words, ""I love you""
And touched you so very subtly
As we were kissing goodbye
(Infamous rocks the box)

I got you stuck off the realness
Feel this pourin' down on your buildings
The rain about to fall us score up in the project call
Third floor gravitates on the staircase

As we embrace strictly loud without the raw base
Me and my ol' dog blowin' out the smokes fog
But over all you the one that's like my pistol
I said, Crystal, keep you on my side till the ficial

Ain't it ill how we click, boo
Me and you got me stuck off the realness
Just me and you, up on the roof beats, Pebble Beach
Talk to me anytime even when I wit my peeps

Ruler L, why you smell like the perfume Chanel?
Push big G's, rappin' all is simply heavy
We can do it on a roof top, do it till we both drop
M O B B with Mariah sounds so hot

Every time I feel the need
I envision you caressing me
And go back in time to relieve the splendor
Of you and I on the rooftop that rainy night

Every time I feel the need
(When I feel the need)
I envision you caressing me
(I envision you over and over and over again)

And go back in time to relieve the splendor
(It was oh so sweet)
Of you and I on the rooftop that rainy night
(You and I , on that rainy night)

Every time I feel the need
(Last night I had the strangest dream)
I envision you caressing me
(It was actually quite symbolic)

And go back in time to relieve the splendor
(As I whispered that I loved you)
Of you and I on the rooftop that rainy night

Mariah Carey,"Many nights we've prayed
With no proof anyone could hear
In our hearts a hopeful song
We barely understood
Now we are not afraid
Although we know there's much to fear
We were moving mountains
Long before we knew we could

There can be miracles
When you believe
Though hope is frail
It's hard to kill
Who knows what miracles
You can achieve
When you believe
Somehow you will
You will when you believe

In this time of fear
When prayer so often proves in vain
Hope seemed like the summer birds
Too swiftly flown away
Yet now I'm standing here
My heart's so full I can't explain
Seeking faith and speaking words
I never thought I'd say

There can be miracles
When you believe
Though hope is frail
It's hard to kill
Who knows what miracles
You can achieve
When you believe
Somehow you will
You will when you believe

They don't always happen when you ask
And it's easy to give in to your fear
But when you're blinded by your pain
Can't see your way safe through the rain
Thought of a still resilient voice
Says love is very near

There can be miracles
When you believe
Though hope is frail
It's hard to kill
Who knows what miracles
You can achieve
When you believe
Somehow you will
Now you will
You will when you believe

You will when you believe
Just believe
Gotta believe
You will when you believe",The Prince of Egypt (When You Believe),1998

Feels like a feeling meant to be 
And as your body moves with mine 
It's like I'm lifted out of time 

And time again 
Patiently I've waited 
For this moment to arrive 

After tonight 
Will you remember 
How sweet and tenderly 
You reached for me 
And pulled me closer 
After you go 
Will you return to love me 
After tonight begins to fade 

I feel your touch caressing me 
This feeling's all I'll ever need 
With every kiss from your sweet lips 
It's like I'm drifting out of time 

Alone will tell 
If you feel the way I feel 
When I look in your eyes 

After tonight (after tonight)
Will you remember 
How sweet and tenderly 
You reached for me and pulled-me closer 
After you go (after you go)
Will you return to love me 
After the night becomes the day

When I think of our untimely end
And everything we could have been
I cry, baby I cry

Okay so it's 5 am and I still can't sleep
Took some medicine but it's not working
Someone's clinging to me and it's bittersweet
'Cause he's head over heels but it ain't that deep
I finally changed my number got a different pager
Then last Saturday your cousin called to say you're 
Trying to reach me, probably because you see that I'm with someone new

Late at night like a little child
Wandering around alone in my new friend's home
On my tippy toes, so that he won't know
I still cry baby over you and me

Sipping Bailey's Cream, by the stereo 
Trying to find relief on the radio (ah, what's up?)
I'm suppressing the tears, but they start to flow
'Cause the next song I hear is the song I wrote
When we first got together early that September
I can't bear to listen so I might as well drift
In the kitchen pour another glass or two and try to forget you (ya know, ya know)

Late at night like a little child
Wandering around alone in my new friend's home
On my tippy toes, so that he won't know

Let that man be on his way
Don't even waste your time and worry 'bout how he handle things
Baby here me when I say
A playa feeling good today
You know you're too fly to even waste your time
Watch how I handle things
Man you's a fool for this
But on the real dog I'm cool with this
We doing this
D-o double G Z-Y
Kiss the girls and make them cry

You will recover (we're gonna make it maybe)

Closest to me
Turned on a dime and sold me
Out dutifully

Away at me
They turned their eyes away and
Went home to sleep

Crazed and demonic, uh without blazin chronic
Product of Reaganomics
You know that motherfuckin stoop raised me
Ringin in da hoops but I was too lazy
School made me sick, teachers said I was too crazy
Low and behold, it's the new and improved Jay-Z
Let me explain this to you baby
I spent nights out, days in
Niggaz was blazing, twelve noon where I was raised in
I felt caged in but kept roaming
Prayed for the Day of Atonement
Married to the streets no date of annulment
It seems every time it comes up
They postpone it
So I kept my chrome at the waist
Waiting for the omen
Savoring the moment and now you know

That's how I make you bounce like that
Defy Webster's words they can't pronounce like that
That's why no other rapper got a sound like that
Trap, trap of my life
Flashback, kill niggaz
Rap skills unmatched, Jigga man baby
I can't entertain it sometimes I can't explain it
God given, gifts of a soul for hard living
Far be it from me to question Allah's wisdom
Could've been lost in the system
Instead I'm involved with the rhythm
I dodged prison, came out unscathed from car collisions
I know I must be part of some mission
Shit I used take it for granted
Why they placed me on this planet
I would ask myself while writin raps to myself
But right there under my nose
Was the flow of all flows
Not a demon but a rose in the cement, come on

Try to bring me down
But I will not allow anyone to succeed
Hanging clouds over me
And they can try hard to make me feel that I
Don't matter at all
But I refuse to falter in what I believe
Or lose faith in my dreams
Cause there, there's a light in me
That shines brightly
They can try but they can't take that away from me

Oh, they, they can do
Anything they want to you
If you let them in
But they won't ever win
If you cling to your pride
And just push them aside
See I, I have learned
There's an inner peace I own
Something in my soul that they cannot possess
So I won't be afraid and the darkness will fade

'Cause there, there's a light in me
That shines brightly, yes
They can try but they can't take that away from me

No, they can't take this precious love I'll always have inside me
Certainly the Lord will guide me
Where I need to go

Oh, they can say anything they want to say
Try to bring me down
But I won't face the ground
I will rise steadily sailing out of their reach
Oh, Lord, they do try
Hard to make me feel that I don't matter at all

Where are you going to, do you know?

When you look behind you there's no open door.
What are you hoping for, do you know?

Chasing the fantasies that filled our minds.
And you knew how I loved you but my spirit was free,
Laughing at the questions that you once asked of me.
Do you know where you're going to?
Do you like the things that life is showing you?

We let so many dreams just slip through our hands.
Why must we wait so long before we see

Watch yourself, get on the floor, move your feet
Woo

There ain't nothing you can do with the man
Except for shake your ass and clap your hands
And bob your head and move your feet
I ain't the type of rapper just to ride a beat
I set the track on fire
I take the roof, the house and let the air out your tires
It's the funk in here
Let Mystikal move you and Mariah sing

Don't stop baby (shake your ass)
It's ecstasy (watch yourself)
Turn me up a little higher
Baby light my fire
Tell me every little thing you wanna do (do the thing)
Baby I'm into you (get on the floor)
Don't stop baby (shake your ass)
It's ecstasy (oh, shake the whole building)
Turn me up a little higher (sing it)
Baby light my fire
Tell me every little thing you want to do
I just want to love you (uh bob your head and move your feet)

Heads up, look out it's 'bout to go down
And what they didn't know about me then, I bet they know now
I'm 'bout to prove my fame
So just get out the way and let me do the thing
It's on tonight
I'm known to be more funky than the garbage truck
Sucker, you can't stop a train
You ain't got no umbrella so get your ass out the rain
You ain't louder than this
I'm like a bowl of gumbo, you ain't hotter than this
I'm what they play in the club
I keep them moving till I leave, that's what your paying me for
You already know what I do
So have my money and my munchies and my cigar too
I'm known for bringing the heat
Ain't nobody cutting up but MC and MC-T

Go head and do a party
Mix that with that dark but don't waste that on my Jordans
Keep laughing till your mouth tired
Go ahead and light something up but take that cigarette outside
Get on the floor
It's another number one debut for sure
Now say it ain't real
And if I ain't a fool why you can't keep still sing

I'm feeling
And I gotta get in the boat (for show)
Jamaican funk that's what it was (feel)
Ooh let it get into you (watch yourself)",Don't Stop (Funkin' 4 Jamaica),2001

Love what your body does to me
On me, asking me, off that ecstasy
Reminiscing how we used to smoke and freak
Fuck then fall asleep, locking for a week
Now we barely even talk and walk the block
Kiss and cuddle up, girl we losing touch
What's a man to do but go crazy babe?
I know you mad but you don't really hate me babe
It's deeper than that, now

[Chorus 1]
Baby if we got together again
Sugar I'ma be your very best friend
I would love you unconditionally
You're never gonna let me go baby

Promise I will be by your side
I'll be everything you need to get by
What I broke you know we finally mend
Baby if we got together again

[Nate]
Sometimes I close my eyes and just pretend
What if I had a chance to do it all again?
Sometimes for happiness we hesitate
Just like the game, I need the love, won't wait
And if I had another best friend
What if I had someone on whom I could depend?
Someone who makes me feel like you used to
Tell me baby, what would you do?

Why would you want to go through the pain?
The loving another name
The truth is nobody can love you like I can
It's a damn shame
We can't even get along
We used to get it on, where'd it all go wrong?
I admit, the flesh is weak
But the game is strong
We go my way, your way baby, we moving on
It's true, goin' miss you
Who would've thought I'd be without you?

I never thought (baby there's nothing to lose)
Thought I'd be (you know my soul's so cold)
Without you (and my love is pain)

I never thought (my baby)
Thought I'd be (pride and joy)
Without you (I'ma make you mine)

Till the bitter end
What we had transcends
This experience
Too painful to
Talk about
So I'll hold it in
Til my heart can mend
And be brave
Enough to love again
A place in time
Still belongs to us
Stays preserved
In my mind
In the memories
There is solace

Never too far away
I won't let time erase
One bit of yesterday
Cause I have learned that
Nobody can take your place
Though we can never be
I'll keep you close to me
When I remember

Glittering lights
Incandescent eyes
Still preserved
In my mind
In the memories
I'll find solace

Never too far away
I won't let time erase
One bit of yesterday
And I have learned that
Nobody can take your place
Though we can never be
I'll keep you close to me
And I'll remember

A place in time
Still belongs to us
Stays preserved
In my mind
In the memories
There is solace

Never too far away
I won't let time erase
One bit of yesterday
Cause I have learned that
Nobody can take your place
And though we can never be
I'll always think of
You and me
Always remember

Care at all for me
Did you really care
Did you care at all for me at all

Wept years in silence
And whispered wishes you'd materialize
She pressed on night and day

To keep on living
And tried to many ways
To keep her soul alive

Care enough for me
Did you really care

Did you care at all for me 
If I'm not quite good enough
Or somehow undeserving of

A mother's love 
You could have had the decency
To give me up
Before you gave me life 
Don't you even care 
Just the slightest little bit for me
Cause I really need to feel you cared

Even once upon a time for me
I need to believe, in my heart of hearts, you care for me
I need to understand

Never thought that I
Would hear them say
Twister went and
Threw it all away

She was kind of magical
Her laughter sent you casually
Floating through a moment
Of release

It's all so tragic
And I'll never
Have the chance
To feel the closure
That I ultimately need
No, I never dreamed
That there would
Come a time
Twister'd go and
Leave it all behind

She's found some peace
And her soul's

I got myself a lover 
Who loves what I like 
When he invites me over 
I come every time 

Oh my sugar daddy 
Takes me for a ride 
Whatever way we're going 
I expect to leave on time 

He's all mine 
And his loving makes me high 
Like a taste of ecstasy 
All I need is him to be my loverboy 

Loverboy 
Come on and love me 
Give me more 
Touch me and touch me 
I enjoy the way you rock me all night long (Baby all night long) 

Loverboy come on and take me 
Only you know how to make me 
Shudder with anticipation 
All night long (All night long) 

I got myself a lover 
And he's so sublime 
He's quite a bit of heaven  
When he comes inside  

So come on sugar daddy 
Take me for a ride 
Whatever way we're going next 
I expect to leave on time 

I get weak 
And his candy's just so sweet 
When he caressed my whole body 
All I need is him to be my loverboy 

Loverboy 
Come on and love me 
Give me more 
Touch me and touch me 
I enjoy the way you rock me all night long (I enjoy the way you rock me)

All night long 

This stuff is starting now 
This stuff is starting now 
It's the same feeling 
I always seem to get around you (Yes I do) 

'Cause you affect me 
Fascinate me 
I thank heaven for the things that you do 
This stuff is starting now 
This stuff is starting now 
This stuff is starting now (Woo) 

My thoughts flow in my head 
I toss and turn in my bed 
In the morning when I think about you (Candy) 
Simply put, you're the reason why 
Even though I'm real shy 
It's like candy 
I attempt to look my best for you (Indeed I do)

Come on and love me 
Give me more 
Touch me and touch me

is broken in two
Everything that I am
revolves around you
And you just don't understand
What a girl goes through

Everyone believes in something
Though we give it different names
You can search the world for that one thing
But it's all the same

Lay your body down
Come and let me bring your
body down
Listen to my voice
the only sound
As I lullaby you,
lullaby you down

As the moon rides away from the sun
She takes all his light and reflects it
I relate them to us just for fun
There's a parallel that's unexpected
Every star in the sky,
reminds me of you
Twinkling in my eyes,
The way that you do
And I don't know why
I get so blue

Everyday is filled with changes
No matter where you go
Living in a world of strangers
So we go for what we know

Lay your body down
Come and let me bring your
body down
Listen to my voice
the only sound
As I lullaby you,
lullaby you down

Everyone believes in something
But it's all the same
Attitude will keep me going
So I guess I can't complain

But, at least I know where I can turn
When I'm in my times of need
Just as long
(As I know all things are possible)
Just as long as I believe

I've loved a lot, hurt a lot
Been burned a lot in my life and times
Spent precious years wrapped up in fear
With no end in sight
Until my saving grace shined on me
Until my saving grace set me free

Giving me peace
Giving me strength when I'd
Almost lost it all
Catching my every fall
I still exist because you keep me safe
I found my saving grace within you

Yes, I've been bruised
Grew up confused
Been destitute
I've seen life from many sides
Been stigmatized
Been black and white
Felt inferior inside
Until my saving grace shined on me
Until my saving grace set me free

Giving me peace
Giving me strength when I'd
Almost lost it all
Catching my every fall
I still exist because you keep me safe
I found my saving grace within you

And the bountiful things that you do
Lord thank you
For delivering me

And giving me peace
Giving me strength
Giving me hope when I'd
Almost lost it all
Catching my every fall
I still exist because you keep me safe
Always my saving grace
Pulls me through
I found my saving grace within you

Within you...

In general is that it's always a game
In the beginning they'll do
Anything to have you
And once they do it's never the same

One: do I really want to trust this feeling
Two: do I want to let it pass me by
Three: do you think it's only superficial

Of being in love once again

And if you happen to be somewhere listening
You should know I'm still here

If she hurts you or misleads you
(then you know I'm singing to you)
Baby all you ever need to do
(so I just wanted you to know)
Is call me and let love rush in
(that ""anytime you need a friend"")

If you really need me (I'm here)
Baby just reach out and touch me
(you can still believe
You don't ever have to be in fairy tales)
Downhearted again (yours and mine)
If she hurts you or misleads you

Mariah Carey,"Well it's been a while
Since I looked into your eyes
Never dreamed I'd see you tonight
And it's interesting that I
Just don't feel a thing
For the so called love of my life

We used to be close
(but you didn't love me)
We used to be best friends
(but you never really cared)
I let you into my soul
(didn't know you couldn't be trusted)
It took me so long to forget
(all the little things we shared)

And now you want me back again
After my heartache and suffering
I was your fool
But that's all in the past
So sorry boy, but you had your chance

See, I spent so many sleepless nights
Trying to block you from my mind
I was so convinced
I'd die without you once upon a time
Now my eyes are open and I can see
You were devious and shady
Only trifling with me

We used to be close
(but you didn't love me)
We used to be best friends
(but you never really cared)
I let you into my soul
(didn't know you couldn't be trusted)
It took me so long to forget
(all the little things we shared)

And now you want me back again
After my heartache and suffering
I was your fool
But that's all in the past
So sorry boy, but you had your chance

Where were you when I needed you most
Would've done anything to hold you close
Would've given the world to be back in your arms
But you left me so torn apart

And now you want me back again
After my heartache and suffering
I was your fool
But that's all in the past
So sorry boy, but you had your chance",You Had Your Chance,2002
Mariah Carey,"You brighten up the moon and stars at night
You keep me seeing rainbows in the sky
You bring new meaning to my life, now
I believe in miracles baby I'm forever yours, yours

Tender love's what you're giving me and
You surpass all my fantasies and
I keep thanking the Lord above for
Blessing me with oh so much

'Cause I know how it feels to be
Part of you boy
Everyday of my life's so abundant
With joy
And I honestly never thought love
Could be real
Until the angels guided you to me

You brighten up the moon and stars at night
You keep me seeing rainbows in the sky
You bring new meaning to my life, now
I believe in miracles baby I'm forever yours, yours

Lying with you so natural
I never knew this was possible
And it finally feels like my life has begun
Now that I can share it with someone

You brighten up the moon and stars at night
You keep me seeing rainbows in the sky
You bring new meaning to my life, now
I believe in miracles baby I'm forever yours, yours

You brighten up the moon and stars at night

Baby our love will always persevere
Anything you ever need,
You know I'll be right here and
You don't have to worry boy

I won't betray your trust
Because I'm so much in love
Every time your lips meet mine
It still feels like the first time

And if you lost everything
I'd keep on standing by your side
And boy it seems like everyday
I fall deeper in love
Because I can't get enough

You keep me seeing rainbows in the sky

Mariah Carey,"You know me well,we go too far back
How could anyone else compete with that
So I just can't help feelin' sentimental
'Bout this in our past

We promised to keep it casual
But at times it can be so difficult
This relationship, so untypical
And I can't understand
Tell me why, tell me why

First you love ma and then you leave me
And then I'm falling back in your arms
There's no conclusion, it's so deceiving
Cause I get taken in by your charms
Even though I try not to bend

[Chorus]
There goes my heart again
Baby why can't we be just friends
It's a mess but we still pretend
Any fool could foresee the end
But there goes my heart again

When I fell you stare catching me off-guard
Boy it's just not fair, 'cause you know for sure
How to lure me in with that magnetic smile
Tell me why, tell me why

First you love me and then you leave me
And then I'm falling back in your arms
There's no conclusion, it's so deceiving
Cause I get taken in by your charms
Even though I try not to bend

First you love me and then you leave me
And then I'm falling back in your arms

There goes my heart again (No, no, no)

When I'm expressing myself
I'm 5'5""
My astrology sign is aries
Thick in my thighs, 36Bs
Pretty brown eyes, no hair weaves
Put it down with hese lucious suckable
Lips
Making you want to reach out and touch'em
Come on and give me a kiss
Could it be those hips just pokin out of my jeans
I showed them once or twice
And some niggas have become feems 
I'm a javouci rocking, hat cockin,
Blunt smoking
No stopping, weave cocking
With constant heat dropping
Bombs on nonbelievers charming

Step on the grind tryin' to elevate it now

Hey yo to really be honest

Can't express the words
How much the kid loves ya
I'ma stand as a man never above ya
I can tell that you different from most
Slightly approach you

We started out broke
Constantly on a roll
Cuttin' up in the streets like we would never get old
Went from Lucy's and buses to fifty cent sodas
And Novas to Hondas to Lexus to Rovers
Mad years passed

And ya know I'll ride with you

And give ya my love and cry with you

Until I was up to touch the sky
So baby come and get more close to me
This is where your love is supposed to be

I pull up to the house in a yellow Lamborghini

Tell me that you love me and those beautiful things
Baby won't you come here 'cause I'm really in need
I'm lost in your love and I don't know what to do with myself
I don't wanna be with nobody else
I just think about you, think about us, think about how much

Can't recover from your kiss because nothing, else compares (uh huh, yeah)

Yo, I remember when I first kicked it to you
We hit it off well, then I used to whisper to you
It was all swell
Said you came from a family with money
Me, I was fresh off the block handling twenties
When I smile was you open or what (uh huh, yeah)
Say you can't judge a book by the cover 'til you open it up
Past hot, we was more like lava-ble (uh huh)
Used to chill and the smoke didn't bother you
Beauty of a rose, scent of a flower
Love when I tell her to, get in the shower, hit it for hours (wooo)
When I thought you was able to cope
That's where things fell apart ma, then it stagnated us both
And now the pain is killing you crazy
While all the time in your mind, you knew I was feeling you crazy
But Kiss is official boo and I'mma come clean

When you're distraught and in pain without anyone
When you keep crying out to be saved
But nobody comes and you feel so far away
That you just can't find your way home
You can get there alone
It's okay, what you say is

And every time I feel afraid I hold tighter to my faith
And I live one more day and I make it through the rain

You will arise safe and sound, so keep pressing on steadfastly
And you'll find what you need to prevail

I can stand up once again on my own
And I know that I'm strong enough to mend

There's nothing you can't face
And should they tell you you'll never pull through
Don't hesitate, stand tall and say

You're bringin' on the heartache",Bringin' on the Heartbreak,2003
Mariah Carey,"When you love someone so deeply
They become your life
It's easy to succumb to overwhelming fears inside
Blindly I imagined I could
Keep you under glass
Now I understand to hold you
I must open up my hands
And watch you rise

Spread your wings and prepare to fly
For you have become a butterfly
Fly abandonedly into the sun
If you should return to me
We truly were meant to be
So spread your wings and fly
Butterfly

I have learned that beauty
Has to flourish in the light
Wild horses run unbridled
Or their spirit dies
You have given me the courage
To be all that I can
And truly feel your heart will
Lead you back to me when you're
Ready to land

Spread your wings and prepare to fly
For you have become a butterfly
Fly abandonedly into the sun
If you should return to me
We truly were ment to be
So spread your wings and fly
Butterfly

I can't pretend these tears
Aren't over flowing steadily
I can't prevent this hurt from
Almost overtaking me
ButI will stand and say goodbye
For you'll never be mine
Until you know the way it feels to fly

Spread your wings and prepare to fly
For you have become a butterfly
Fly abandonedly into the sun
If you should return to me
We truly were ment to be
So spread your wings and fly
Butterfly

Spread your wings and prepare to fly
For you have become a butterfly
Fly abandonedly into the sun
If you should return to me
We truly were ment to be
So spread your wings and fly
Butterfly

So flutter through the sky
Butterfly
Spread your wings and fly

Mariah Carey,"My dear, my dear, my dear,
You do not know me
But I know you very well
So let me tell about Da Brat tatatat
I'm light skin, redbone,
Peanut butter complexion
Very affectionate, very direct
When I'm expressing myself
I'm 5'5""
My astrology sign is aries
Thick in my thighs, 36Bs
Pretty brown eyes, no hair weaves
Put it down with hese lucious suckable
Lips
Making you want to reach out and touch'em
Come on and give me a kiss
Could it be those hips just pokin out of my jeans
I showed them once or twice
And some niggas have become feems 
I'm a javouci rocking, hat cockin,
Blunt smoking
No stopping, weave cocking
With constant heat dropping
Bombs on nonbelievers charming

They call it the life of leisure
I'm preaching what I'm speaking
This shit you ain't used to seeing

Hey now

To drop off my package
A big zipped locked baggy to support my habit
We'll go together like roger
And jessica rabbit
I'm spoiled rotten,
I'm rocking pink silk panties
At the moment
But I'm sport cotton
But jeanie's dreamin of
Jeanie will blink me to scottie
So he can beam me pump adrenaline
Into my blook steam
Proceed extremely with caution
I'm probably gleaming
Because my bling bling is
Worth a fortune
It seems things will never change
So I puffed often cause these dayz,

But for sure, before I go
You niggas gonna know my name
Cause I'm so doogie, one in a million
Cop a brazzillion for the coochie
That rides smoothly
Pass the doogie, the dutchie
Rudely interrupted, your regularly
Scheduled program

When you're distraught and in pain without anyone
When you keep crying out to be safe but nobody comes
And you feel so far away that you just can't find your way home
You can get there alone, it's okay, what you say is

I can make it through the rain
I can stand up once again on my own
And I know that I'm strong enough to mend
And every time I feel afraid I hold tighter to my faith
And I live one more day and I make it through the rain

And if you keep falling down, don't you dare give in
You will arise safe and sound, so keep pressing on steadfastly
And you'll find what you need to prevail, what you say is

I can make it through the rain
I can stand up once again on my own
And I know that I'm strong enough to mend
And every time I feel afraid I hold tighter to my faith
And I live one more day and I make it through the rain

And when the wind blows, as shadows grow close
Don't be afraid, there's nothing you can't face
And should they tell you you'll never pull through
Don't hesitate, stand tall and say

I can make it through the rain
I can stand up once again on my own
And I know that I'm strong enough to mend
And every time I feel afraid I hold tighter to my faith
And I live one more day and I make it through the rain

I can make it through the rain
And stand up once again
And I live one more day and night

That's the trickery
She'll wanna have like you know how this lovin' used to be
I bet she can't do like me
She'll never be M-C

Mariah Carey,"Baby, when you look my way
You keep on blowin' my mind
You keep on makin' me high
Keep giving me butterflies and
Every little thing you do
Just lifts me off of the ground
Heart leaps when you come around
See, I'm just breakin' it down

You got everything I need, just
Want you to want me, you
Just can't imagine boy
I'm on a tangent

Cause I'm sprung over you
And ain't nothing I can do
Turning me upside down
Boy you got me twisted out
Thoughts of you fill my head
Toss and turn in my bed
Cause I'm sprung over you
And I don't know, don't know what to do

Oh it's hard to make believe
It's just a casual thing
You're so unnerving to me
Feels like I'm living a dream, but
Baby please don't wake me up
I'm lost in the reverie
Drifting ethereally
I'm right where I wanna be

You got everything I need, just
Want you to want me, you
Just can't imagine boy
I'm on tangent

Cause I'm sprung over you
And ain't nothing I can do
Turning me upside down
Boy you got me twisted out
Thoughts of you fill my head
Toss and turn in my bed
Cause I'm sprung over you
And I don't know, don't know what to do

I don't care 'bout nothing but you baby
I don't care 'bout nothing but you baby

Cause I'm sprung over you
And ain't nothing I can do

I gotta shake it off
‘Cause the loving ain't the same
And you keep on playing games
Like you know I'm here to stay

I gotta shake, shake it off
Just like the Calgon commercial
I really gotta get up outta here
And go somewhere

I gotta shake it off
Gotta make that move
Find somebody who
Appreciates all the love I give

Boy I gotta shake, shake it off
Gotta do what's best for me
Baby and that means
I gotta shake you off

By the time you get this message
It's gonna be too late
So don't bother paging me
‘Cause I'll be on my way

See I grabbed all my diamonds and clothes
Just ask your momma she knows
You're gonna miss me baby
Hate to say, “I told you so”

Well at first I didn't know
But now it's clear to me
You would cheat with all your freaks
And lie compulsively

So I packed up my Louis Vuitton
Jumped in your ride and took off
You'll never ever find a girl
Who loves you more than me

I gotta shake it off
‘Cause the loving ain't the same
And you keep on playing games
Like you know I'm here to stay

I gotta shake, shake, shake shake, shake it off
Shake, shake, shake shake, shake it off
Shake, shake, shake shake, shake it off
Shake, shake, shake shake, shake it off

I found out about a gang
Of your dirty little deeds
With this one and that one
By the pool, on the beach, in the streets
Heard y'all was

Hold up, my phone's breakin' up
I'ma hang up and call the machine right back
I gotta get this off of my mind

You wasn't worth my time
So I'm leaving you behind
‘Cause I need a real love in my life

Save this recording because
I'm never coming back home
Baby I'm gone
Don't cha know

I gotta shake you off

And you keep on playing games

You know I like it when you in my world
C'mere lil' momma lemme freak yo' body
Then roll wit me in the Bentley white pearl
Girl you know you get me so erotic
Especially when I be sippin' Hypnotiq
Got me feelin' like I'm smokin' on chronic
When we fuckin' it be so exotic
Now I know that everything be on fire wit Mariah
And she know she be dealin' with a baller
Hiccup ashes and meet me through the wire
Fulfullin' desires like a Chi shot caller
Do you love how the Twista went at you (at you)
Do you love when I hit it from the back too (back too)
Let me feel how you hook up that one way
C'mon baby girl let me see what that do

I wish that we could, blow up the speakers
Over and over, tell jokes and secrets
Forever, your lady, you act right, then maybe
Ain't nothing to talk about, with the music loud
So they won't hear me say

Ah, hah hah, hah hah, come and be my one and only
I'm tired of being so lonely, come hold me
Ah, hah hah, hah hah, wanna wrap myself around you (around you)

Now we pullin' up out the garage
In the platinum blue I-nage
Me and you about to hit that club
To the bar so we can sip that bub
Both of us together we be the livest
If I had to break it down, how would I describe it
(Ah, hah hah, hah hah)
We the type of couple that when we get up with each other
We get it crackin' in the kitchen or the bedroom
It don't matter where we at, we be makin noise
So play the track, so the bass'll make your head boom
Break you off when you hold one leg up
And you know I like the way you put it on me
It's the East coast queen and the midwest mob boss
Shawty I'm a never leave you lonely

I wish that we could, blow up the speakers
Over and over, tell jokes and secrets

Let me give it to you through this song
Let me give it to you in the hallway
Let me give it to you on the balcony baby (that's right)

Give it to you on the West coast (West coast)
Give it to you down South
Let me give it to you in the mid west baby
Let me give it to you in the U.K.
Let me give it to you through the DJ
Let me give it to you in the rack or the back

Give it to you however you desire
And I gotta show you that I ain't a liar
I'm a console you even when you lonely
Come and listen to the Twista and Mariah

Mariah Carey,"Ever since you left me
I've been trying to hide the pain
Painting on a smile with lipstick
Putting on a big charade
So difficult to keep pretending
It's getting harder everyday
It's plain to see I'm cold and heartsick
Since you turned and walked away
I just keep going round and round
And round in circles
Keep on tumbling down

Oh boy my world has changed
And I don't think I can make it without out
Nothing's the same
You got me running around in circles over you
(Running around in circles over you)

Saturday I saw you
Holding hands with someone new
Somehow I kept my composure
Just like everything was cool
But inside I kept repeating
Don't you let them see you cry
So I casually turned my head
As the tears rolled down my eyes
I just keep going round and round
And round in circles
Keep on tumbling down

Oh boy my world has changed
And I don't think I can make it without out
Nothing's the same
You got me running around in circles over you
(Running around in circles over you)

Everything is you
How can I pull through
My heart is consumed I'm so confused
Still caught up in you...love can be so cruel
Baby don't know how to turn you loose

Oh boy my world has changed
And I don't think I can make it without you
No, nothing's the same

Take to the sky
I need you now, Lord
Carry me high
Don't let the world break me tonight
I need the strength of you by my side
Sometimes this life can be so cold
I pray you'll come and carry me home

Can we recover?
Will the world ever be
A place of peace and harmony
With no war and with no brutality?
If we loved each other
We would find victory
But in this harsh reality
Sometimes I'm so despondent
That I feel the need to...

When he goes down low
But see, it ain't just a physical thing
He's gotta treat me affectionately
And I gotta know he won't betray my trust
Just like every other motherfucker does
Is this just an impossible dream, baby
Too elusive to pursue
It's been such a sad and windy road for me
Just searchin' for the truth

Every time I turn around
I find my heart in pieces on the ground so, so lonely
I'm lookin' for my one and only
Every time I turn around
I find my heart in pieces on the ground
Why can't I find my one and only

Now you know I roll a Beamer and a Benz 
And I'm dishin' out N's 
While you trippin' on a playa
Baller, havin' bitter conversations 
While we're rollin' on 24's 
And I know you got doubts 
Why you listen to what people talk about
You ain't figured out why they call ya 
The heavy steady hatin' cause 
You rollin' on 24's 
See how your money flows
You dress in designer clothes 
From head to the toe
You ain't satisfied, well tell me 
What you lookin' for

I'm lookin' for my one and only

Well, I'll be your one and only 
If you give me a chance
I'll make the change for you, girl 
I know I ain't been the most faithful 
Nigga in the world
But let's stay together so we can shine like pearls
Spittin it to ya while I roll a shisha of fire
To kiss your lips, I desire
Twist and Mariah, together like a 
Grip on the tire 

I'm lookin' for my one and only

Well, come on Shorty, let me make it better 
We can do whatever 
While we're sittin' on suede and leather 
Thinkin' through the city 
While we rollin' lonely 
Let's kick it in the Chi
I know I messed up with ya, I ain't gon' lie
I know you were feelin' 
You really know your guy 
But baby girl, I ain't mean to blow your high 
Let me pick the pieces up 
And put them back together cause I want to be with you 
Don't want to leave you lonely
Ride with you like a homey, never, no phony
Shorty, can I be your one and only

Every time, oh mm
Every time I turn around
I find my heart in pieces on the ground so, so lonely
Why I'm looking for my one and only
Every time I turn around ah, ha ha ha ha
I find my heart in pieces on the ground
Why can't I find my one and only
Still lookin' for my one and only
Every time I turn around ah, ha ha ha ha
I find my heart in pieces on the ground so, so lonely
Yeah, I'm lookin' for my one and only
I'm lookin' for my one and only
Every time I turn around ah, ha ha ha ha
I find my heart in pieces on the ground
I'm lookin' for my one and only

Well at first I didn't know
But now it's clear to me
You would cheat with all your freaks
And lie compulsively

Jumped in your ride and took off
You'll never ever find a girl
Who loves you more than me

Of your dirty little deeds

Hold up my phone's breakin' up
I'ma hang up and call the machine right back
I gotta get this off of my mind

want to hold you close

But I don't want to play myself

And I don't need complications in my life
And I don't want to fall back in
And get caught up in you again

Just let me rock you till the morning light
It's cold outside
And much too late to drive

Close to you a little longer now
It's hard for me to break away from you baby
Never could resist you
And I still haven't learned how
And I don't want to be a fool
But it's hard when it comes to you

And it's breaking my heart

But I'm falling apart

I'm feeling all out of my element
I'm throwing things, crying
Trying to figure out
Where the hell I went wrong
The pain reflected in this song
It ain't even half of what
I'm feeling inside

When you left I lost a part of me
It's still so hard to believe
Come back baby, please
'Cause we belong together

Who else am I gon' lean on
When times get rough
Who's gonna talk to me on the phone
Till the sun comes up
Who's gonna take your place
There ain't nobody better
Oh, baby baby, we belong together

I can't sleep at night
When you are on my mind
Bobby Womack's on the radio
Saying to me
""If you think you're lonely now""
Wait a minute
This is too deep (too deep)
I gotta change the station
So I turn the dial
Trying to catch a break
And then I hear Babyface
I only think of you
And it's breaking my heart
I'm trying to keep it together
But I'm falling apart

I'm feeling all out of my element
I'm throwing things, crying
Trying to figure out
Where the hell I went wrong
The pain reflected in this song
It ain't even half of what
I'm feeling inside
I need you
Need you back in my life, baby

When you left I lost a part of me
It's still so hard to believe
Come back baby, please
'Cause we belong together

Just let it die
With no goodbyes
Details don't matter
We both paid the price
Tears in my eyes
You know sometimes
It'd be like that baby

Now every time I see you
I pretend I'm fine
When I wanna reach out to you
But I turn and I walk and I let it ride
Baby I must confess
We were bigger than anything
Remember us at our best
And don't forget about

And wakin' up inside my arms
Boy, you'll always be in my heart and
I can see it in your eyes
You still want it

I'm just speaking from experience
Nothing can compare to your first true love
So I hope this will remind you
When it's for real, it's forever
So don't forget about us

Oh they say
That you're in a new relationship
But we both know
Nothing comes close to
What we had, it perseveres
That we both can't forget it
How good we used to get it

There's only one me and you
And how we used to shine
No matter what you go through
We are one, that's a fact
That you can't deny
So baby we just can't let
The fire pass us by
Forever we'd both regret
So don't forget about

And if she's got your head all messed up now
That's the trickery
She'll wanna have like you know how this lovin' used to be
I bet she can't do like me
She'll never be M-C

Mariah Carey,"Baby, when you look my way
You keep on blowin’ my mind
You keep on makin’ me high
Keep giving me butterflies

And every little thing you do
Just lifts me off of the ground
Heart leaps when you come around
See I’m just breakin’ it down

You got everything I need
Just want you to want me
You just can’t imagine, boy
I’m on a tangent

‘Cause I’m sprung over you
And ain’t nothing I can do
Turning me upside down
Boy, you got me twisted out

Thoughts of you fill my head
Toss and turn in my mind
‘Cause I’m sprung over you
And I don’t know, don’t know what to do

Oh, it’s hard to make believe
It’s just a casual thing
You’re so unnerving to me
Feels like I’m living a dream

But baby, please don’t wake me up
I’m lost in the reverie
Drifting ethereally
I’m right where I wanna be

You got everything I need, just
Want you to want me, you
Just can’t imagine, boy
I’m on a tangent

‘Cause I’m sprung over you
And ain’t nothing I can do
Turning me upside down
Boy, you got me twisted out

Thoughts of you fill my head
Toss and turn in my mind
‘Cause I’m sprung over you
And I don’t know, don’t know what to do

I don’t care ‘bout nothing but you, baby
(Nothing but you, baby)
I don’t care ‘bout nothing but you, baby

‘Cause I’m sprung over you
And ain’t nothing I can do

Blindly I imagined I could 
Keep you under glass 
Now I understand to hold you 
I must open up my hands 
And watch you rise

Spread your wings and prepare to fly 
For you have become a butterfly 
Fly abandonedly into the sun 
If you should return to me 
We truly were meant to be 
So spread your wings and fly 
Butterfly 

I have learned that beauty 
Has to flourish in the light 
Wild horses run unbridled 
Or their spirit dies 
You have given me the courage 
To be all that I can 
And truly feel your heart will 
Lead you back to me when you're 
Ready to land 

[Chorus]

I can't pretend these tears 
Aren't over flowing steadily 
I can't prevent this hurt from 
Almost overtaking me 
ButI will stand and say goodbye 
For you'll never be mine 
Until you know the way it feels to fly

So flutter through the sky

Heat Heat Heat Heat Heat Heat Heat Heat
Heat Heat Heat Heat Heat Heat Heat Ahhh

They said I couldn't come no harder
Can't sleep on this heat don't bother
They said I couldn't they said I couldn't
Can't sleep on this heat don't bother

I see you with your favorite dress on again
I guess you thought that you were slick
But I already peeped
You got your tag tucked in
You're strugglin'
Tryin' to look cute in your best friend's boots
But they don't hardly fit
Why you back again
Tryin' to steal my man
I told you once before but
You don't hear me
I ain't who you think I'm is
I will snatch off all this ish

You think I won't come out these heels
And make it clear
I ain't the one
You think I won't fuck up my hair
And take it there
I ain't the one
Keep your hands up off my boo
Ain't no telling what I'll do
What makes you think you fly enough to
Take my man, no
Sho ain't the one
Sho ain't the one
I ain't the one

All these J.O.'s want what's mine
But they done lost their mind
They on him like the ice cream man,
Night and day
Why I got to fight to keep 'em all away
They crammin' but they know
They can't have none
Obsessin' but they're messin' with the wrong one

I ain't who you think I'm is
I will snatch off all this ish

You think I won't come out these heels
And make it clear
I ain't the one
You think I won't fuck up my hair
And take it there
I ain't the one
Keep your hands up off my boo
Ain't no telling what I'll do
What makes you think you fly enough to
Take my man, no
I ain't the one

They said I couldn't come no harder
Can't sleep on this heat don't bother
They said I couldn't come no harder
Can't sleep on this heat don't bother
They said I couldn't come no harder
Can't sleep on this heat don't bother
They said I couldn't they said I couldn't
Can't sleep on this heat don't bother

You think I won't come out these heels
And make it clear
I ain't the one
You think I won't fuck up my hair
And take it there
I ain't the one
Keep your hands up off my boo

Ain't no telling what I'll do
What makes you think you fly enough to
Take my man

Like a motor revin' over and over
It don't stop
He cruised beside me now
I'm flyin', drivin'

Through yellow lights
I'm ignorin' every sign of caution that they provide
Driver's Education 101
Slipped out of my mind
I need me a caddy
With some cruise control
No, no, no

I've been told so many sagas
He brings the drama, six baby mamas
(But uh ooh)
I can't resist 'em
Just want to kiss 'em
I need cruise control

Might need to go slow, I don't know
Why ease up on the break
Every time I see his face
I'm outta control, ah I don't know
How to stay up in my lane
Every day and night
He's cruisin' through my brain

(Wherever I go he be cruisin'
Turn to the right ooh he so smooth with it
Deep down inside don't want to lose him
He already know I'm willin' to go
Gotta get on cruise control)

'Cause he's the flyest ting when he be cruisin'
On me avenue
Then da door open, de gals 'pon de block
They be hopin, to rob the clock me say no man
Step up step up bottle broken

You put your hand in cruise control
And you deny me if you want
And you will starve yourself of love
If you don't speed and break the law
You can't get no speeding ticket
On the highway to my heart
And it might be a rocky road
And you can exit if you want (why you always)
Look at life just like a pessimist
You already like a wife up in my premises
And right ya now you cruise control it is my nemesis
Just come again and stop and start just like a genesis

You oughta know
You wasn't thinking
When you let me go

But whatever
That's how it goes
Win some you lose some
And others you hold in your heart

Why it gets so hard
Tears you all apart
Even though you try to let go
No, no, no

Suddenly you're here
And it's so surreal
And I don't know
What the deal

'Cause when I'm looking in your eyes
Feels like the first time
Give me one good reason why
We can't just press rewind

I don't wanna spend my life
Thinking what it could've been like
If we had another try (one time)
Like back in the day
That look on your face
Feels like, the first time

Them other irregularities
They can't compete with MC
The whole entire world can tell
That you love yourself some me

People see ya know
Asking all about
Me and how they always thought we
Were so perfect together

Let's re-write the end
Start over again
And it's gon go better now

Can't nobody say
I didn't give my all to you

I told you underneath the stars
That you belong to me

It's obvious that
We just can't let go of us, honey

(Baby, I stay in love with you)

Dying inside 'cause I can't stand it
Make or break up
Can't take this madness
We don't even really know why
All I know is baby
I try and try so hard
To keep our love alive

If you don't know me at this point
Then I highly doubt you ever will
I really need you to give me
That unconditional love I used to feel
It's no mistaking
We're just erasing
From our hearts and minds

And I know we said let go
But I kept on hanging on
Inside I know it's over
You're really gone
It's killing me
'Cause there ain't nothing
That I can do
Baby, I stay in love with you

And I keep on telling myself
That you'll come back around
And I try to front like ""oh well""
Each time you let me down
See I can't get over you now
No matter what I do
But baby, baby

Na na na na na na na na na
Na na na na na na na na na

It cuts so deep
It hurts down to my soul
My friends tell me
I ain't the same no more
We still need each other
When we stumble and fall
How we gon' act
Like what we had
Ain't nothin' at all now

Hey, what I wanna do is
Ride shotgun next to you
With the top down like we used to
Hit the block
Proud in the SUV
We both know our heart is breaking
Can we learn from our mistakes
I can't last one moment alone
Now go I know

And I know we said let go

Mariah Carey,"This goes out to you and you and you
You know who you are

When glory days turn to stormy nights
You must have been so petrified
Didn't you, didn't you feel so cold
You against the world in a losing fight (a losing fight)
Captive of your demons inside

So you sought an enemy
(I'm not your enemy)
Like times before to mock ignorantly (he lives in you, you know it's true)
(But the Lord said love, love your enemy so just)
Take heed to the word it's time
Check Proverbs 19:29
Don't cry

I wish you well
I wish you well
I wish you well

I truly wanted solidarity
Still wearing my blinders back then
(So much I didn't see)
I weep for what I dreamed we all could be
I'll keep you in prayer 'till the end

Still bruised, still walk on eggshells
Same frightened child, hide to protect myself
(Can't believe I still need to protect myself from you)
But you can't manipulate me like before
Examine first John chapter four verse four

And I wish you well
I wish you well
I wish you well

Be strong in the Lord and power of His might

If my shows of gratitude are minuscule
Inside your mind, sorry
(I'm so sorry, please forgive me)
(There's only so much I can do) I love you and did all that I could

Maybe when you're cursing me
You don't feel so incomplete
But we've all made mistakes
Felt the guilt and self-hate

I know you've been there for me plenty
Maybe still got love for me
But let him without sin cast the first stone brethren
But who remains standing then
Not you not I see Philippians 4:9
(Put it into practice)

So I wish you well
I wish you well
I wish you well

(He who the Son sets free is free indeed)
No weapon formed against me shall prosper
Surely God is my salvation
I will trust and not be afraid
The Lord, the Lord is my salvation
I will trust in Him
Yes, I know that I know that I know that I know

But I have had God's help to this very day
And so I stand here and testify
To small and great alike
So the more you curse me
The more you're blessing me
The Word said it
Love your enemies

Do good to those who curse you
Pray for those who mistreat you
Psalms 129:2
They have greatly oppressed me from my youth
But they have not gained victory over me

Mariah Carey,"(Ay bay bay it won't end, won't end, won't end)

(Let's talk 'bout love, won't end, won't end)

This is my love story
Boy meets girl and looks in her eyes
Time stands still and two hearts catch fire
Off they go roller-coaster ride
Up and down and around
Twisted all out they minds
And then his friends
Said ""its too soon to settle down""
And then her friends
Said ""he's a playa, slow it down""
They couldn't be who they was
'Cause it just seemed like love
Wasn't on their side

But this isn't just another love story
Together we'll make history
I know because it's just too real
They'll be no end to our love story
And this ain't gon' end up
Like that Casablanca movie, no
This ain't no fairy tale or fiction
This is truly ours for the eternity
They'll be no end to our love story baby

(Ay bay bay it won't end, won't end, won't end)

There's no end to our love story
Chapter two
When they meet up again
Second time around
See but they're just friends
But the feelings still strong
And it's been too long
To be trippin' like they ain't been missing
They on the phone like
Ay bay bay
Let's meet up today
Got's bout an hour or two
You might as well come through

We can make it like it was
Just the two of us
Back up on that roller-coaster
Like we been supposed to
'Cause this isn't just another love story

Together we'll make history
I know because it's just too real
They'll be no end to our love story
And this ain't gon end up
Like that Casablanca movie (no)
This ain't no fairy tale or fiction
This is truly ours for the eternity
They'll be no end to our love story baby

Just when it seemed
Like all the odds
Were stacked against them
They came back stronger then before
Matter fact then some
Stronger then pride
Lookin' like them
Lookin' like her, lookin' like him
Stronger then hate
And the whole world too
Lookin' like me
Lookin' like you

'Cause this isn't just another love story
Together we'll make history
I know because it's just too real
They'll be no end to our love story
And this ain't gon end up
Like that Casablanca movie, no
This ain't no fairy tale or fiction
This is truly ours for the eternity
They'll be no end to our love story baby

Ay bay bay it won't end, won't end, won't end

Once again nothin' jumpin' up in yo place
Sick of your berry buzzin' all in my face
Way too much to tolerate
Time to roll
Y'all know I gots to migrate

Speed dial connecting me to Rae-Rae (hey)
Click in Shawntae and Mae-Mae (hey)
Treat it as a holiday
'Cause he's a wrap
Y'all know I had to migrate

See I'm on my way home
'Cause my jeans, yeah they fit
But it might benefit
Me to throw something on
To feature my hips
Accentuate my ****
And steal the show

Soon as we walk through the door
Fellas be grabbin' at us like yo
Tryin' to get us going off the Patron
We sippin' Grigio slow

If your neck and your wrist coordinate
Hair braided or faded okay
We can move this back to my place
It's time to migrate

From my car into the club we migrate
From the bar to VIP we migrate
From the party to the after party, migrate
After party to hotel, migrate

As we proceed getting buzzed
The envious ones
Hatin' but they can't take they eyes off us
But we don't see none of that
They playin' my jam
And the floor is packed
So ya'll need to migrate up out the door

We clickin' glasses
Compliments of the club
Raise they status
So you know they show us love
Everywhere we go
They gon' flock
Them boys migrate to where it's hot
(It's hot, it's hot)

Fellas be grabbin' at us like yo
Tryin' to get us going off the Patron

Otherwise, migrate

From the bar to VIP we migrate
From the party to the after party, migrate
After party to hotel, migrate

This is where it begins
And ends at the very same time
Teddy Pain the main man of the hour
Got a flow that'll flex yo tire
Got stacks plus I'm back with Mariah

We stay down like flour flats 
On the Cadillac 
Packed to the back 
With four phat girls
If you feel like doin' a dance
I'm gonna pull up my dance girl
Come on back girl

But I gotta migrate to bar
From the bar to the flo'
From the flo' to the car
From the car to the crib
Then back to the club
We can migrate in that
Mini coupe sittin' on dubs

Whatcha waitin' on
I can't stand in one place
I'm on that platinum and that Patron
And I hate when I don't get it my way
So don't wait for me to buy drinks
Or you gon' dehydrate
It's time to migrate

Soon as I'm walk through the door
They know I'm from the 8-5-0
I need three bottles of that Patron
I can make the Chevrolet creep so slow
If your and your coordinate
Tell it to me like it ain't okay
We can move this back to my place
Shawty best believe, it's time to migrate

Another hit, okay
We lookin' fine, takin' off
Saw us on a runway
On any given Sunday
Monday, Tuesday (haha)
They try to confuse me
I never let 'em use me

I was a girl, you was a man
I was too young to understand
I was naive, I just believed
Everything that you told me

Said you were strong, protecting me
Then I found out that you were weak
Keeping me there under your thumb
'Cause you were scared that I'd become much

More than you could handle
Shining like a chandelier
That decorated every room
Inside this private hell we built
And I dealt with it like a kid
I wished I could fly away but instead

I kept my tears inside 'cause I knew if I
Started I'd keep cryin' for the rest of my
Life with you I finally built up the strength
To walk away don't regret it
But I still live with the side effects

Wakin' up scared some nights
Still dreamin' 'bout the violent times
Still a little protective 'bout the people
That I let inside
Still a little defensive
Thinkin' folks be tryin' to run my life
Still a little depressed
Inside I fake a smile and deal with the

Side effects
Side effects
Side effects
Side effects

Vacant inside no one was there
Couldn't be real, had to keep quiet
Once in a while put up a fight
It's just too much night after night

After a while I would just lie
You were dead wrong said you were right
Did what I could just to survive
Couldn't believe this was my life

Flickering like a candle
Doin' my best to handle
Sleepin with the enemy
Aware that he was smothering
Every last part of me
So I broke away and finally
Found the strength to breathe

I kept my tears inside 'cause I knew if I
Started I'd keep cryin' for the rest of my
Life with you I finally built up the strength
To walk away don't regret it
But I still live with the side effects

Hey Magnifico or should I say Magnificent?
Ain't nothing worth your happiness
And I ain't caring who you're with
Misery love company so we ain't tryin' to hang with y'all
Hurt you if you let 'em in
Gotta keep your circle small
Keep tryin' to play
I tell him I ain't blowin' tho
Think they want me outta here
I tell 'em I ain't goin' tho

How is this?

Mariah Carey,"I lay awake sometimes
Scared to close my eyes
And I wonder where I left myself
And lost the will to fight

And the night melts into morning
Still it's cold beneath the sun
'Cause the fire in me is languishing
And I'm too frozen to run

And every once in a while
There's a distant glimmer of hope
I find somewhere deep inside
Someone strong still resides
And I know she's gonna be fine in time

'Cause, you see
I've got a lot to dream
There's more than this for me

An angel lands with broken wings
He warms me with his eyes
And the ice that's sheathed around my heart
Unravels as he smiles

See I grew up locked in sorrow
So I learn to block the pain
But I won't give up tomorrow
'Cause I've come to life again

And every once in a while
There's a distant glimmer of hope
I find somewhere deep inside
Someone strong still resides
And I know I'm gonna be fine, that's right

'Cause, for real
I've got a right to dream
There's more than this for me

But I keep goin' 'cause every once in a while
There's a distant glimmer of hope
I find somewhere deep inside
Someone strong still resides
And I know she's gonna be fine in time

'Cause, you see
I've got a right to dream
There's more than this for me",Right to Dream,2008
Mariah Carey,"I don't want a lot for Christmas
There is just one thing I need
I don't care about the presents
Underneath the Christmas tree

I don't need to hang my stocking
There upon the fireplace
Santa Claus won't make me happy
With a toy on Christmas Day

I just want you for my own
More than you could ever know
Make my wish come true
All I want for Christmas is you
You baby

Oh I won't ask for much this Christmas
I won't even wish for snow
And I'm just gonna keep on waiting
Underneath the mistletoe

I won't make a list and send it
To the North Pole for Saint Nick
I won't even stay awake to
Hear those magic reindeer click

'Cause I just want you here tonight
Holding on to me so tight
What more can I do?
Baby all I want for Christmas is you
You you you baby

Oh all the lights are shining
So brightly everywhere
And the sound of children's
Laughter fills the air

And everyone is singing
I hear those sleigh bells ringing
Santa won't you bring me the one I really need?
Won't you please bring my baby to me?

Oh I don't want a lot for Christmas
This is all I'm asking for
I just want to see my baby
Standing right outside my door

Oh I just want you for my own
More than you could ever know
Make my wish come true
Oh, baby all I want for Christmas is
You baby

All I want for Christmas is you baby
All I want for Christmas is you baby
All I want for Christmas is you baby
All I want for Christmas is you baby

Mariah Carey,"How can I just let you walk away,
Just let you leave without a trace,
When I'm standing taking every breath,
With you, ooohhh,
You're the only one who really knew me, 
At all.

How can you just walk away from me, 
When all I can do is watch you leave,
Cause we shared the laughter and the pain,
And even shared the tears,
You're the only one who really knew me at all.

So take a look at me now,
There's just an empty space,
There's nothing left here to remind me,
Just the memory of your face,
So take a look at me now, 
There's just an empty space,
If you're coming back to me it's against the odds,
And that's what I've got to face.

I wish I could just make you turn around,
Turn around and see me cry,
There's so much I need to say to you,
So many reasons why,
You're the only one who really knew me at all.

So take a look at me now,
There's just an empty space,
There's nothing left here to remind me,
Just the memory of your face,
So take a look at me now, 
So there's just an empty space,
But to wait for you is all I can do,
When that's what I've got to face.

Take a good look at me now,
Cause I'll be standing here,
(Mark: Standing here)
And you coming back to me is against the odds,
And that's the chance I've got to take.
 
Got to take
Got to take

Ooh
Take a look at me now

Take a look at me now.",Against All Odds,2008
Mariah Carey,"Many nights we prayed 
With no proof anyone could hear 
In our hearts a hope for a song 
We barely understood 
Now we are not afraid 
Although we know there's much to fear 
We were moving mountains 
Long before we knew we could

There can be miracles when you believe 
Though hope is frail, it's hard to kill 
Who knows what miracles 
You can achieve 
When you believe somehow you will 
You will when you believe 

In this time of fear 
When prayer so often proves in vain 
Hope seems like the summer bird 
Too swiftly flown away 
Yet now I'm standing here 
My hearts so full, I can't explain 
Seeking faith and speaking words 
I never thought I'd say 
There can be miracles 
When you believe (When you believe) 

Though hope is frail 
It's hard to kill 
Who knows what miracles 
You can achieve (You can achieve) 
When you believe somehow you will 
You will when you believe 

They don't always happen when you ask 
And it's easy to give in to your fears 
But when you're blinded by your pain 
Can't see the way, get through the rain 
A small but still, resilient voice 
Says hope is very near, oh 

There can be miracles (Miracles) 
When you believe (Boy, when you believe, yeah)
Though hope is frail (Though hope is frail, it's hard)
It's hard to kill (Hard to kill, oh, yeah) 
Who knows what miracles 
You can achieve (You can achieve, oh) 
When you believe somehow you will (Somehow, somehow, somehow) 
Somehow you will (I know, I know, know) 
You will when you believe (When you)
You will when you (You will when you believe)

Mariah Carey,"I shouldn't have walked away
I would've stayed if you'd say
We could've made everything okay, but we just
Threw the blame back and forth, we treated love like a sport
The final blow hit so low, I'm still on the ground

I couldn't have prepared myself for this fall
Shattered in pieces, curled on the floor
Super natural love conquers all, remember we
Used to touch the sky
And lighting don't strike
The same place twice, when you and I
Said goodbye I felt the angels cry
True love's a gift,
But we let it drift in a storm
Every night I feel the angels cry

C'mon babe, can't our love be revived?
Bring it back and we gon' make it right
I'm on the edge, just tryin' to survive
As the angels cry

Limitless omnipresent, kind of love
Couldn't have guessed it would just stop and disappear
In a whirlwind
Here I am walkin' on this narrow rope wobbling
But won't let go, waitin' for a glimpse of the sun's glow

I know I can stand just pull me back up
Like there ain't no hurricane it's just us
I'm willing to live and die for our love
Baby, we can get back that shine

'Cause lighting don't strike, the same place twice
When you and i, said goodbye, I felt the angels cry
'Cause true love's a gift, but we let it drift, in a storm
Every night, I feel the angels cry

C'mon babe, can't our love be revived
Bring it back and we gon' make it right
I'm on the edge, just tryin' to survive
As the angels cry

Baby, I'm missin' you, don't allow love to lose (don't let our love)
We gotta ride it through
I'm reaching for you (baby I'm missin' you)
Baby, I'm missin' you, don't allow love to lose (you can)
We gotta ride it through, (we gotta ride it)
I'm reaching for you (and I'm gonna say)

Ou lighting don't strike, the same place twice

Mariah Carey,"Though the lights were low
I could see you both
In a lover's silhouette
And my heart stood still
I was froze right there
Staring down at her red dress
So I bolted out the door
Jumped right into the car
It's too dangerous
To be in the vicinity of where you are
Rolled down all the windows
Just so I could breathe
I can't believe you just actually did this **** to me
I'm going 'bout a hundred
Mascara runnin'
Laughing out of anger
But it don't strike me as funny
Been too good to you
I've been virtuous and true
To have something like this
Happen in my own bedroom

(When I get you back)
Betcha goin' know oh how it feels
(When your heart's been cracked)
Betcha goin' know oh how it feels

And you see your whole world collapse
I'm a la-la-la-la-la-laugh
I'm a la-la-la-la-la-laugh
I'm a la-la-la-la-la-laugh right in your face boy
Betcha goin' know oh how it feels

So I pulled to the side
Of the road to fix my face
But I can't cover with make up
What my tears want to erase
I wake up in a haze
Morning dew and sun rays
As I drive I hide my eyes
Behind my black Cavalli Shades
A block from the house
Slowly creep in the driveway
Tip toe through the door
But you're there wide awake
You like ""where you been?""
I'm like ""sorry""
I fell asleep of Jasmine's sofa
I coulda swore that Ray Ray
Called you and told ya""
You like ""you okay""
I'm like ""I'm alright
Little sleep and I'll be fine""
But if you only knew
What was in the back of my mind
You already stung
But you really goin' find out in time

Betcha goin' know oh how it feels

Mariah Carey,"I still remember
That hazy September
I've been waiting for somebody like you
To come back around

We would walk in the park
Every Saturday
Brand new
All in love
Kissing time away
You was all up on me
It was plain to see
That I was your girl
Way back when it was the simple thing
Anklets, Nameplates
That you gave to me
Sweet tarts, ring pops, and that candy bling
And you were my world

Now I wish I could go back and make time stop
I would take this love throwback from the top
Go DJ play my song
And I'm a think about you all night long

Back in the days we were in love
Were not in love anymore
But some days
I sit and wish we was in one again
Back in the days we were in love
Were not in love anymore
But some days
I sit and wish we was in one again

It was personal things we would do
Fall asleep on the phone and skippin' school
Now I'm back to the future missing you

My sweet baby
My sweet thang
Like candy
Felt like real love
Not just play play
Missing you
My sweet baby

It was everything that I could do
To stay awake
And I often reminisce
About the games we played
It was Tag, Chess, Spin The Bottle
Then butterflies would last 'till tomorrow
Then the lights came on
I had to run right home

And now I wish I
Could go back and my time stop (stop, stop, stop)
And I would take this love throwback from the top
Go DJ play my song
And I'm a think about you all night long

Back in the days we were in love
We're not in love anymore
But some days
I sit and wish we was in one again
Back in the days we were in love
We're not in love anymore
But some days
I still wishing we was in one again

It was personal things we would do
Fall asleep on the phone and skippin' school
Now I'm back to the future missing you

My sweet thang
Like candy
Felt like real love
Not just play play
Missing you
My sweet baby

I'm a see Mimi
Felt the need to change me
Butterfly flow
Like Mohamed Ali
Wish I can bring you back
Like the O.D.B
Thinkin' bout the world
Plus me you and Jack
No matter what I do
Well the memories are stacked
Thinkin' tenth grade
Thinkin' 'bout eleventh
When you went doggy fresh
All the way to heaven heaven heaven

Back in the days we were in love
We're not in love anymore
But some days
I sit and wish we was in one again
Back in the days we were in love
We're not in love anymore
But some days
I still wishing we was in one again

Back in the days, still remember
Now I'm back in the, now I'm stack in my future missing you

Mariah Carey,"Once upon a time
We swore not to say goodbye
Something got a hold of us
And we changed
And you sat alone in pride
And I sat at home and cried
How'd our fairy tale just end up this way?

We went round for round
Til' we knocked love out
We were laying in the ring
Not making a sound
And if that's a metaphor of you and I
Why is it so hard to say goodbye?

I can't wait to hate you
Make you pain like I do
Still can't shake you off
I can't wait to break through these emotional changes
Seems like such a lost cause
I can't wait to face you
Break you down so low there's no place left to go
I can't wait to hate you, ooh

This was all a phenomenon that no one could explain
And I wish I could press reset and feel that feeling again
I sit and press rewind
And watch us every night
Want to pause it but I can't make it stay

We went 'round for 'round
'Til we knocked love out
We were laying in the ring

Break you down so low there's no place left to go
I can't wait to hate you, ooh

No need to call my phone
'Cause I changed my number today
And matter fact I think I'm moving away (away)
Sorry the frustrations got me feelin' a way
And I just keep having one last thing to say
And I just want to hold you, touch you, feel you
Be near you, I miss you babe babe babe (babe babe babe)
I am tired of tryin' to fake through
But there is nothing I can do
Boy I can't wait to hate you

I can't wait to hate you
Make you pain like I do
Still can't shake you off
I can't wait to break through these emotional changes

A little time to think things over
I better read between the lines

I want you to show me

You did the impossible (you did the impossible)
You rescued my love
You did the impossible (you did the impossible)

Love ya like we're destined

Tonight I'm gonna need all your attention
Close the door
I wanna do things I probably shouldn't mention
Like a bird I'm gon' hum

Freeze the time, let the world go by
If you're mine say, you love me, you love me, you love me
Boy take my hand and make me a part of you and the love that
You gave to me has pulled me through

You did the impossible (you did the impossible)
You rescued my love

Videos on my phone, why can't I just erase them

And I read it like time after time

Boy I'm lost, can't you look, won't you please find me
I'm down to my last tick, come rescue me

That I was not put here for you
To judge me and dispute my innerst truth

I was wondering
Would you cry for me?

If I was drowning, suffocating
If I told you that I couldn't breathe

While we're too torn to heal
Our stitch has never disappeared
I have mine, you have yours

Warming up when he looks our way

For a honey to hold Christmas day

This Christmas cheer

Yet when they arrived

Asleep glorious and pure

Came to realize the homie Bieber hit me on the Twitter
Then I hit him back that's right I had some food up on my fingers
Sipping eggnog, with a little sprinkle of vanilla
Even though it's kind of cool I'm pulling on a chinchilla
Bieber hit me back and said lets make it hot up in the winter
I said cool, cool
You know I will deliver let's collaborate and make the holiday a little bigger
Before we work I gotta get this off
See the other family members and drop gifts off
Then I'm headed to the studio 'cause ain't nothing stopping
How you know we about to turn it up and really get it poppin' now

It's about time for you give to charity
Rarely do people, don't wanna even help at all
'Cause they wont bother buying, getting toys, getting dolls

Wishin', wishin' that they had somebody they could hold
So I think some of you need to act bold

But I ain't gon' stop, 'cause I'm gon' climb
To the mountain top, to the mountain top, now let's go

Can't fall down, stay triumphant, keep on living
Stay on your toes
Get off the ropes
Don't let 'em ever count you out
Realize all things are possible
In your heart who's the greatest
Reach for the stars
Be all that you are
And make 'em all fall down

Path that I choose flashing cameras as I pose
Throwing big money as she dances on the pole
Lime green Lamborghini dances in the road
License still suspended, no I never stop for tolls
Born slick talker, twice a week shopper
Blow a hundred wreck she don't know a footlocker
Red bottom boss house big as Baltimore
With a blonde bombshell tryin' to bomb with your boy
In the James Bond Beamer chrome wheel two seater
Smoking like Pimp C, spoken like a trill nigga
On a cloudy day baby I can make it rain
Rubber band, 50 grand bet it brighten up your day
Came from humble beginnings
Then was Hummers and Benzes
Now it's hundreds and millions, this is only the beginning
A don, a diva, the born achiever
The one believer, the game gets deeper

Can't fall down, stay triumphant, keep on living
Stay on your toes
Get off the ropes
Don't let 'em ever count you out
Realize all things are possible
In your heart who's the greatest
Reach for the stars
Be all that you are
And make 'em all fall down

Get 'em, get 'em, get 'em (Go)
Hit 'em, hit 'em, hit 'em (Go)
Get 'em, get 'em, get 'em (Go)
Hit 'em, hit 'em, hit 'em (Go)
Get 'em, get 'em, get 'em (Go)
Hit 'em, hit 'em, hit 'em (Go)
Get 'em, get 'em, get 'em (Go)
Hit 'em, hit 'em, hit 'em (Go)

Can't fall down now, so even when clouds surround you
And everyone seems to doubt you
Baby still know who you are
So you gotta keep on climbing
In spite of the chains that bind you
You can see the mountain top
It's not too far

Can't fall down, stay triumphant, keep on living
Stay on your toes
Get off the rope
Don't let 'em ever count you out
Realize all things are possible
In your heart who's the greatest
Reach for the stars
Be all that you are
And make 'em all fall down

Can't fall down, stay triumphant, keep on living
(Get 'em, get 'em, get em)
Stay on your toes, get off the ropes
(Stay on your toes)
Don't let 'em ever count you out
(No, no, no, no)
(Get 'em, get 'em, get 'em, get 'em go)
Realize all things are possible
In your heart who's the greatest
Reach for the stars
Be all that you are
And make 'em all fall down

You're almost home
You're almost home
You're almost home

I've seen the light in the sky
In the skies are like fireflies
Burning bright, just to vanish in the dark

I've held hope in my two hands
That there would be another chance
To find the kingdom, I'm believing in my heart
Cause underneath the good there's something greater than you know

When you're almost there
And you're almost home
Just open up your eyes and go, go
When you're almost there, almost home
Know you're not alone
You're almost home

When you run, run so far
You've forgotten who you are
Where you're from, it's like some other universe
You count your steps, like they're regrets
You catch one breath then lose the rest
Wrong is right, right is left
And there's nowhere left to turn

So don't believe in everything
You think, you think you know

When you're almost there
And you're almost home
Just open up your eyes and go, go
When you're almost there, almost home
Know you're not alone
You're almost home

When you let your heart be the compass
You won't get lost, not if you trust it
When you hear the sound of the trumpet
Louder than ever before

Oh, when you're almost there
Almost home
Just open up your eyes and go, go
Cause you're almost there
Almost home
Know you're not alone
You're almost home

When you're almost there
Almost home
Just open up your eyes and go, go
Almost there

Know you're not alone

Mariah Carey,"Oh, welcome to a day of my life (day of my life)
The memoir of an imperfect angel

Woah, welcome welcome welcome to a day of my life
The memoir of an imperfect angel oh

Though the lights were low, I could see you both
In a lover's silhouette
And my heart stood still, I was froze right there
Staring down at her red dress
So I bolted out the door, jumped right into the car
It's too dangerous to be in the vicinity of where you are
Rolled down all the windows, just so I could breathe
Can't believe you just actually did this shit to me
I'm going 'bout a hundred, mascara running
Laughing out of anger, but it don't strike me as funny
Been too good to you
I've been virtuous and true
To have something like this, happen in my own bedroom

Betcha gon' know oh how it feels (when I get you back)
Betcha gon' know oh how it feels (when your heart's been cracked)
Betcha gon' know oh how it feels (when we fade to black)
How it feels for real
And you see your whole world collapse

Before we both get loud, I'ma break it down
And let you know what happened for real
I was over her house, me and her on the couch
And the whole plan was just to chill
And then it got hot, after taking some shots
The time must have slipped away
Because all I know, I woke hungover
And girl it was the very next day
With the sun in my face
I woke up in a rage
Screamed, ""What have you done to me?""
And I'm telling you babe
I know it sounds crazy, she must have put something in my drink, uh
I know you don't believe it
And you think I'm dead wrong
Standing there butt naked
With nothing but a sheet on
Then she come down
With nothing but a robe on
And that's when
I put my damn clothes on
Got the fuck up out of there

Girl you know I know how it looks
(See I know how it looks)
Baby you know I know how it looks
(But baby it ain't like that)
Girl you know I know how it looks eh eh eh eh
So don't go accusing me of something
That I didn't really mean to do

This is for real, for real, for real (no)

20/20, Barbara Walters, for real, for real (no)

I had all my trust in you and look at what you put me through
(You got me all crazy) (this is not my fault, no know it baby)

Mariah Carey,"On the back cover of this album is a personal treasure
This is my first and only self-portrait
I drew it when I was three and a half and entitled it
""Me. I Am Mariah.""
Please don't judge me for such a simplistic title
Come on, I was only three and a half

It was a creative visualisation of how I saw myself
With the purity of a child's heart before it was ever broken
I've kept this drawing private for so long
But because this album is a reflection
of some of the peaks and valleys that have made me who I am today
I've decided to share it with those of you who actually care
And have been here for me through it all
I've been through a lot, but I've always known me
I am Mariah

Along the way there have been a couple of nicknames
And I've inadvertently embodied many personas
Lately, they've been calling me

Wonderin' could I muster the strength to exist in the bitter cold (cold)
But you showed up once in a while, I guess that's alright
'Cause I told my heart that you needed time for yourself, it's fine

I camouflage my tears and you wear your disguise
And I then go
to know that you still love me (I need to know, say that you do)
To know if you still love me (I need to know, say that you do)

Wear it sometimes when I try to discern our reality
Wish that I just could be somebody else if you talk to me
Kept praying inside let him love me for who I am
Please my Lord (please my Lord)
But you where just somewhere the sun couldn't reach
Couldn't understand

to know that you still love me (I need to know, say that you do)

Didn't I give you all of me

No no no
When I, don't wonder inside
If you feel the way you used to feel

I camouflage my tears
And you wear your disguise
And ran, and ran, I flow

And that's all I really wanted
that's all I really wanted

And kiss you soft and feel your hands on me

And maybe I didn’t give you your space back then
And maybe I should have just held out a little bit longer
But I was seduced by you, and I didn't know enough
Truly too enchanted to disregard the words you said to make me yours
I need to hold you until we break

Til we both break down (break down)
Til we both break down
I should have known that you were trying to love me
Oh til we both break down and cry

Oh my love, imprudently I left every cell in me
So naked, somewhere at the core of you
Bless our souls

I just need you til we both (Til we both break down)

And I was at your feet
I didn't feel the danger
Now I feel the heat
That look in your eyes
Telling me no, oh
So you think that you love me, NO
And that you need me

Is my pride

Sucking your teeth, don't fuck up my mood
I'm trying to give it all to you
I can understand it's things we go through
Put C's on your bag, let see this here through
And we can be a size receipts from Nobul
But I gotta get it out of you

She don't love you unless she put your whole name on it
Gettin' money, yea this age is hard
Not the datin', I act a way
When all the pretty bitches love you but you'll stay precious

I miss you almost half as much as you miss me
You used to act so tough, bringing insecurity
Now that I found myself, your eggin' to be mine
Can't even help yourself from playing the fool each night

A model that I got, no class in this school
Take your bags and go boo
Never mind all of the flexin' I do
Balenciagas, got me two steppin' on a smooth
Never will I lower my standards my boo
I could show you we're attendants like Sampras on Que
That's kinda funny 'cause love still mean lose
Unless we kill the record and back-and-forth moves

And when the door won't welcome you
Heaven will help you inside
Gathered 'round
Bearing the gifts to the crown
A miracle comes, the babe is born
And angels are heard on high

How do I disappear?
Here beyond the looking glass
Somewhere off the beaten path
Heartache never seems to pass, just lasts
And I'd go

Yet I know that tomorrow comes, so I'll be here when you rise
Stay real close and the moment will subside
Look the other way as I bottle myself up inside
I won't let the teardrops spill tonight
Just conceal myself and hide
A portrait of my life

Somewhat desensitized, still the same hopeful child
Haunted by those severed ties
Pushing past the parasites
Down but not demoralized
Unconfined, but don't let go

Yes I know that tomorrow comes, so I'll be here when you rise
Stay here close and the moment will subside
Look the other way as I bottle myself up inside
I won't let the teardrops spill tonight
Just conceal myself and hide
A portrait of my life

And for the finale, she can float around effortlessly
And dream away the hours in her mind
And I'd let go

Yet I know that tomorrow comes, so I'll be here when you rise

J'repense à mon grand frère et son rêve occidental
Tous les soirs il nous lisait les lettres venues d'la Tour Eiffel
De son pote Moussa, parti pour aller faire une fac de lettre
Il disait qu'il était riche, qu'en France l'argent pousse sur le sol
Là-bas on te soigne gratuitement et même les pauvres vont à l'école
Il faisait rêver mon frère, lui qui voulait d'un autre avenir
J'ai perdu mon plus gros repère quand j'ai entendu mes parents lui dire

Pourquoi tu quittes la maison, là-bas les hommes oublient l'essentiel
Pourquoi tu quittes la maison, ne crois pas que tout est mieux là-bas

Tout le monde, te demande, on a besoin de toi
Ne nous quitte pas, on a besoin de toi
Laisse pas tes parents, l'avenir du pays
Tout le monde te demande on a besoin de toi

Depuis qu'tu nous a quitté, toutes les nuits on vit les yeux ouverts
Depuis qu'tu nous a laissés, tous les jours on attend une petite lettre
L'océan la peut-être mangé, ils savent peut-être pas nager
Le coeur nous a lâché, quand son petit frère est venu nous dire :

Papa je quitte la maison, là-bas les hommes utilisent leurs ailes
Mama je quitte la maison, ne pleure pas ton fils va vivre ses rêves

Tout le monde, te demande, on a besoin de toi
Ne nous quitte pas, on a besoin de toi
Laisse pas tes parents, l'avenir du pays
Tout le monde te demande on a besoin de toi

Y'a qu'au football là-bas qu'on n'regarde pas la couleur de peau
Au pays d'la liberté, y'a un berger et un troupeau
J'ai vu aussi mon grand frère, il vit avec Moussa loin d'la Tour Eiffel
Ils on stoppé la fac de lettre pour remplir l'assiette
Loin du soleil africain, tous les matins sur le marché
Les larmes aux yeux il se souvient quand vous lui disiez

Gotea tu rezongo lerdo
Marea tu licor y arrea
La tropilla de la zurda
Al volcar la ultima curda

Cerrame el ventanal, que arrastra el sol
Su lento caracol de sueño
No ves que vengo de un país
Que esta de olvido siempre gris
Tras el alcohol

Contame tu condena
Decime tu fracaso
No ves la pena que me ha herido?
Y háblame simplemente
De aquel amor ausente
Tras un retazo del olvido

Ya sé que me hace daño
Yo sé que te lastimó
Llorando mi sermón de vino
Pero es el viejo amor
Que tiembla, bandoneón
Y busca en el licor que aturda
La curda que al final
Termine la función
Corriéndole un telón
Al corazón",La  Última Curda,2008
Marian Gold,"I've been walking dirty avenues 
You already know that didn't you?
Keeping me miles away 
So unlike yesterday
You're changing your mind again
 
All those close encounters 
How dumb to ever doubt those
Try to forget about 
The words that speak so loud
You're changing your mind again
 
How many times will we go over this
And how bad to you want it?
How many highs and lows?
How many yes and no's?
You do it again
You kidding me, you can't be serious 
Wish I would stop feeling delirious
You take the probable and make it impossible 
That's such a game changer
 
Tried to make you my asylum 
Loved how you are so unlike him
Maybe I'm magnified
Your love is no place to hide 
You're changing my mind again 
 
Stop turning the house to black
If you're so sure then never come back
Already knew about what happens once you're out 
You're changing your mind again
 
How many times did we get over this
How much more ways to laugh at this
How many cons and pros 
Maybe God only knows
You do it again

You do it again
 
You kidding me, you can't be serious 
Wish I would stop feeling delirious
You take the probable and make it impossible 
And we're so close to having it all

Much too close",Game Changer,2018
Marian Grudeff,"[On a late night in the spring of 1827 
The city of Vienna is experiencing the largest lightning storm in its long history. 
Within a large disheveled room, 
Ludwig Von Beethoven is slumped over his piano 
And on the piano sits the just completed manuscript for his tenth symphony. 
It is his final, and he is certain, his greatest work.]

Since the time when ra and isis
Raised the sphinx out of the sand
And apollo dreamed athena
And men began to understand

That when darkness folds on darkness
In the restless tides of night
And lightning raises shadows
And for moments gives them life

It's been said by those who ponder
That it surely is a sign
That a life touched by the stars
Is now running out of time

And that somewhere in that darkness
In the heart of that great storm
The world returns a soul
That the gods caused to be born

And this was such a storm
The kind one rarely sees in life
For in a room now filled with shadows
The great Beethoven was spending

His last night

[From the shadows a beautiful spirit, fate, 
And her deformed dwarf son, twist, 
Emerge to inform Beethoven of what he has already deeply suspected, 
That this is to be his last night on earth. 
They are accompanied by numerous spirits and ghosts from his past.]",Overture,1965

Feel your fingers run through my hair

Looking at the street lights
Since I been without you
Had a lot of late nights

I don’t miss you tugging my sleeve
I don’t need your hand on my cheek
I don’t think about you before I fall asleep

Playing with my skirt

Driving home alone I feel your arm around my waist

Marian McPartland,"I was a stranger in the city
Out of town were the people I knew
I had that feeling of self-pity
What to do, what to do, what to do
The outlook was decidedly blue

But as I walked through the foggy streets alone
It turned out to be the luckiest day I've known

A foggy day, in London town
Had me low, had me down
I viewed the morning, with much alarm
British Museum, had lost its charm

How long I wondered,
Could this thing last
But the age of miracles, hadn't past
For suddenly, I saw you there
And through foggy London town,
The sun was shining everywhere

For suddenly, I saw you there
And through foggy London town,

One little thought to me
Though someone else may be
Nearer your heart?

Moments before we two
Drifted apart?

Oh! Will you never set me free?
The ties that bound us
Are still around us
There's no escape that I can see
And still those little things remain
That bring me happiness or pain

A cigarette that bears a lipstick's traces
An airline ticket to romantic places
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
A tinkling piano in the next apartment
Those stumbling words that told you what my heart meant
A fair ground's painted swings
These foolish things remind me of you
You came you saw you conquer'd me
When you did that to me
I knew somehow this had to be
The winds of March that make my heart a dancer
A telephone that rings but who's to answer?
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

First daffodils and long excited cables
And candle lights on little corner tables
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
The park at evening when the bell has sounded
The ""Ile de France"" with all the gulls around it
The beauty that is Spring's
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The sigh of midnight trains in empty stations
Silk stockings thrown aside dance invitations
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

Gardenia perfume ling'ring on a pillow
Wild strawb'ries only seven francs a kilo
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
The smile of Garbo and the scent of roses
The waiters whistling as the last bar closes
The song that Crosby sings
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The scent of smould'ring leaves, the wail of steamers
Two lovers on the street who walk like dreamers
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you",These Foolish Things,1951

I might as well play bridge
With my old maid aunt
I haven't got a chance
This is a fine romance

A fine romance, my good fellow
You take romance, I'll take jello
You're calmer than the seals
In the Arctic Ocean
At least they flap their fins
To express emotion

With no insults and all morals
I've never mussed the crease
In your blue serge pants
I never get the chance

Always hear when you sigh
Never in my wordland

In a phrase how I feel

Bill and coo when they love?
That's the kind of magic 
Music we make with our lips when we kiss

He really knows how to cry

The night we met
There was magic abroad in the air
There were angels dining at the Ritz
And a nightingale sang in Berkeley square

I may be right I may be wrong
But I'm perfectly willing to swear
That when you turned and smiled at me
A nightingale sang in Berkeley square

The moon that lingered over London town
Poor puzzled moon he wore a frown
How could he know we two were so in love
The whole damned world seemed upside down

The streets of town were paved with stars
It was such a romantic affair
And as we kissed and said goodnight
A nightingale sang in Berkeley square

How strange it was
How sweet and strange
There was never a dream to compare
To those hazy crazy nights we met
And a nightingale sang in Berkeley square

Ah this heart of mine
Loud and fast
Like a merry-go-round in a fair
We would dance cheek to cheek
And a nightingale sang in Berkeley square

The dawn came stealing up
All gold and blue
To interrupt our rendez-vous
I still remember how you smiled and said
Was that a dream or was it true?

Our homeward step was just as light
As the dancing feet of Astaire
And like an echo far away
And a nightingale sang in Berkeley square

I am starry-eyed and vaguely discontented
Like a nightingale without a song to sing
Oh, why should I have Spring fever
When it isn't even spring?

I keep wishing I were somewhere else
Walking down a strange new street
Hearing words that I have never heard
From a girl I've yet to meet

I'm as busy as a spider spinning daydreams
I'm as giddy as a baby on a swing
I haven't seen a crocus or a rosebud or a robin on the wing

Sweet as a breath of air
Fresh with the morning dew
So rare You're like the sparkle of old champagne
Orchids in cellophane 
Couldn't compare to you 
You are perfection you're my idea 
Of angels singing the Ave Maria
For you're an angel, I breathe and live you
With every beat of the heart that I give you 
So rare, This is a heaven on earth we share
Caring the way we care
Ours is a love so rare
 
So rare, You have the warmth of a Schubert air
Charming and debonaire
Those are the words for you
So rare You have a way that's beyond compare
That ""one in a million"" air
In everything you do
You have that something, that certain manner
You thrill me more than the ""Star Spangled Banner""
You stage a love scene, so sweetly tender
And in that love scene I gladly surrender
So rare, to have a future like yours to share
Sweetheart the way we care

I was kissed by my sisters, my cousins, and my aunties.
Sad to tell, it was hell, an inferno worse than Dante's.

So my dear I swore,
""Never, never more!""
On my list, I insisted that kissing must be crossed out.
Now, I find I was blind, and oh my! 
How I lost out!

I could cry salty tears,
Where have I been all these years?
Little wow, tell me now,
How long has this been going on?

There were chills up my spine,
And some thrills I can't define.
Listen, sweet, I repeat,
How long has this been going on?

Oh, I feel that I could melt,
Into Heaven I'm hurled!
I know how Columbus felt,
Finding another world.

Kiss me once, then once more.
What a dunce I was before.
What a break! 
For Heaven's sake!
How long has this been going on?

Dear, when in your arms I creep,
That divine rendezvous,
Don't wake me, if I'm asleep,

All silver bells, coral shells, carousels
And the laughter of children at play

And we fade to a marvelous view

Seeing images in the firelight
As my eyes visualize a family
They see Emily, Emily

Seeing images in the firelight

One look is all you'd need to see the mood I'm in.
Perhaps then you'd realize I'm still in love with you.
If you could see me now, you'd find me being brave
And trying awfully hard to make my tears behave
But that's quite impossible, I'm still in love with you.

And the month will be May for a while.
I'll try to smile but can I play the part

Marian McPartland,"A country dance was being held in a garden
I felt a bump and heard an ""Oh, beg your pardon""
Suddenly I saw polka dots and moonbeams
All around a pug-nosed dream

The music started and was I the perplexed one
I held my breath and said ""May I have the next one?""
In my frightened arms, polka dots and moonbeams
Sparkled on a pug-nosed dream

There were questions in the eyes of other dancers
As we floated over the floor
There were questions but my heart knew all the answers
And perhaps a few things more

Now in a cottage built of lilacs and laughter
I know the meaning of the words ""Ever after""
And I'll always see polka dots and moonbeams
When I kiss the pug-nosed dream",Polka Dots and Moonbeams,1978

I let you
We broke the ties that bind

And high above
The moon was new
And so was love

Love had its day

Have you anything to say to me?
Won't you tell me where my love can be?
Is there a meadow in the mist
Where someone's waiting to be kissed?

Skylark
Have you seen a valley green with spring?
Where my heart can go a journeying
Over the shadows and the rain
To a blossom covered lane

And in your lonely flight
Haven't you heard the music in the night?
Wonderful music, faint as a will o' the wisp
Crazy as a loon, sad as a gypsy serenading the moon

Oh skylark
I don't know if you can find these things
But my heart is riding on your wings
So if you see them anywhere
Won't you lead me there?

With inspiration, in your arms 
Our lips meeting soft and tender 
Love's all aglow 
Why shouldn't we surrender

Like the ocean beats upon the sand

Marian McPartland,"Everyone knows him as Old Folks
Like the seasons, he'll come and he'll go
Just as free as a bird and as good as his word

Always leaving his spoon in his coffee
Tucks his napkin up under his chin
And that yellow cow-pie is so mellow it's ripe
But you needn't be ashamed of him
Every Friday he'll go fishing, down on his favorite lake
But he only hooks a perch or two, the whale got away
Looks like we warm the steak

What a lonesome old town this will be

Hearing guitars like someone in love.

Stopped off at the North Pole to spend a holiday
I called on dear old Santa Claus
To see what I could see
He took me to his workshop 
And told his plans to me, so

Better not pout, I'm telling you why

Gonna find out who's naughty and nice

He knows when you're a wake
He knows if you've been bad or good

Better not pout, I'm telling you why

And curly head dolls that toddle and coo
Elephants, boats, and kiddie cars too
Santa Claus is comin' to town
Then kids in Girl and Boy land will have a jubilee
They're gonna build a Toyland all around the Christmas tree
So! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
 
Now Santa is a busy man, He has no time to play
He's got millions of stockings to fill on Christmas day
You'd better write your letter now
And mail it right away
Because he's getting ready
His reindeer's and his sleigh. So

Angels have no thought of ever returning you
Would they be angry if I thought of joining you?
Gloomy Sunday

Gloomy is Sunday, with shadows I spend it all
My heart and I have decided to end it all
Soon there'll be flowers and prayers that are sad, I know
Let them not weep, let them know that I'm glad to go
Death is no dream, for in death I am caressing you
With the last breath of my heart I'll be blessing you
Gloomy Sunday

Dreaming, I was only dreaming
I wake and I find you asleep in the deep of my heart, deep
Darling, I hope that my dream never haunted you
My heart is telling you how much I wanted you

Of something that never happened, yet you recall it well
You know the feeling of recognizing someone
That you've never met as far as you could tell, well

Laura is the face in the misty light
Footsteps that you hear down the hall
The laugh that floats on a summer night
That you can never quite recall
And you see Laura on the train that is passing through
Those eyes, how familiar they seem
She gave your very first kiss to you
That was Laura but she's only a dream",Laura,2009

Used to a nigga sleeping on me, goodnight

Se acabo si es que algún día comenzó

No dejes de tambalear

Y tampoco me a me avergüenzo yo de mi galán
Aunque sea pobre y tenga un carra viejo
Me saca como reina
Un hombre de verdad

Y aunque tenga una carcacha
Lo que importa es que voy con él
Tampoco será el más guapo
Pero sí es mi novio fiel

Carcacha, paso pasito
No dejes de tambalear
Carcacha, poco a poquito
No nos vayas a dejar
Carcacha, poco a poquito
No nos vayas a dejar
Carcacha, paso a pasito
No dejes de tambalear
Carcacha, poco a poquito
No nos vayas a dejar
Carcacha, paso a pasito
No dejes de tambalear",La Carcacha (aka Carcacha),2005

Será que habrá encontrado otra mujer 
Ya no es el mismo, su indiferencia 
La siento por las noches, rechaza mi presencia 

Amiga no será que has descuidado 
La forma de buscarlo en el amor 
Quizás la casa, la rutina 
Se ha convertido en tu enemiga 
Y estás cobrando un alto precio por tu error

This lucky girl.
You have given everything
To this lucky girl.
I thought fairy tales did not come true,
Now I can't be sure since I met you.
Please, take my love.
When you love me with your eyes
I'm a lucky girl.
Makes me almost realise
I'm a lucky girl.
If you would leave our love would surely die
The world to me is only you and I.
Please, take my love.
It's all I can give to you
Fort what it's worth
It seems as long, as long as I'm here
With you.
Darling I'll always be
Your lucky girl.
Then one kiss before you leave
It's lucky girl.
Yes, it's getting late now but now you know
That I just can't bear to see you go.
So take my love,
Take my love,
Please, take my love.

Marianne Faithfull,"Some other spring I'll try to love,
Now I still cling to faded blossoms.
Fresh when one left crushed and torn
Like the love affair I'm on.

Some other spring, when twilight falls,
Will the night bring another to me ?
Not your kind will let me find
It's not true that love is blind.

Sun shines around me,
But deep in my heart, it's cold as ice.
Love wants you for me,
But can the story be told twice ?

Some other spring will my heart ring
Stirring to sing love's magic music.
Then forget the old duet
Find love with some other spring.",Some Other Spring,1966
Marianne Faithfull,"Green are your eyes
In the morning when you rise.
Don't you be afraid, my love,
To lie by me,
Your father will not know.
Love can be broken
Though no words are spoken.
Don't you be afraid to lie
By me my love,
Your father will not know.
Love, don't cry
I'll not try.
Don't you be afraid to lie
By me, my love,
Your father will not know.

About our wedding day.

As he goes hurrying by.

Fare thee well a while,
For the ship is a-waiting and the wind blows free
And I am bound away for the sea,
Mary Ann.

If I had a flask of gin,
Whiskey there for two
And a great big bowl for to mix them in
I'd mix a drink for you my dear
Mary Ann.

The lobster boiling in the pot,
The bluefish on the hook;
The pain they bear is nothing like
The ache I bear for you, my dear
Mary Ann.

Fare thee well, my own true love
Fare thee well a while,
For though I go I'll surely come again
Though it be ten thousand miles, my dear

Fare thee well, my dear,
For the ship is a-waiting and the wind blows free
And I am bound away for the sea,

Parsley, sage, rosemary, and thyme.
Remember me to one that lives there
For once she once was a true lover of mine.

Tell her to make me a cambric shirt
Parsley, sage, rosemary, and thyme.
One with no seams, of fine needlework
And then she'll be a true lover of mine.

Tell her to dry it 'pon yonder thorn
Parsley, sage, rosemary, and thyme.
That never bore fruit since Adam was born
And then she'll be a true lover of mine.

Ah, can you find me an acre of land
Parsley, sage, rosemary, and thyme.
Between the salt sea and the sea sand
Or never be a true lover of mine.

And can you plough it with a sheep's horn
Parsley, sage, rosemary, and thyme.
And sow it all over with one peppercorn
Or never be a true lover of mine.

And when you have done and finished your work
Parsley, sage, rosemary, and thyme.

And then you'll be a true lover of mine.",Scarborough Fair,1966

And my father won't slight you for your lack of kind""
Then she turned her head to me and this she did say
""It will not be long, love, till our wedding day""

She turned away from me and she moved through the fair
And I watched her so swiftly move here and move there
Then she turned away homeward with one star awake
Like a swan in the evening moves over the lake

Last night, I did dream that my dead love come in
So softly she entered that her feet made no din

All the flowers of the mountain.

Marianne Faithfull,"Now is the glimmering spinning beginning
Of something I've prayed for and counted the minutes
To be in the shadows of sheltering meadows
Of night, here with you in my arms.

This is the moment that pauses to hold us
As you and I move in a background of wonder,
Surrounded by countless enclosures
Of nocturnal unspoken music of joy.

Counting times you have stood at the foot of my ivory tower
And waited, and called out my name by the hour,
And counted on the wings of my heartstrings
To carry the sound, I have counted on pleading,
You see how I need you, come down.

And now between twilight and midnight I come to you,
Down in my gown of soft moonbeams and starlight,
Bright is the evening, the breezes have fenced us
And nestled against us 

You're here
And warm.

And mine till the time
When the dawn will awake you,
The morning will shake you,
The highway will take you.

But now all the rays of the moon making bouquets
Will swim through the luster of lingering street lights
We count on the night to hold everything even,
And count on forgetting that you will be leaving,
And destiny's folded and then in the dawn you'll be gone.

But now as the gardens of softening night time
Are blossoming slowly around where we are,
You and I come together
And walk through the dreams of the stars.

So here while the song of the deepening evening
Is singing to me from the light in your eyes,
We can count on each other to move to the beach of tomorrow
And know where we've been.",Counting [UK Version],1967
Marianne Faithfull,"It seems the songs we're singing
Are all about tomorrow,
Tunes of promises that we can't keep.

A love I can only borrow,
You're telling me lies in your sleep.
Do you think I'm not aware
Of what you're saying
Or why you're saying it ?
Is it hard to keep me where
You want me staying ?
Don't go on betraying.
Don't make promises that you can't keep.
We had a chance to find it,
Our time was now or never,
You promised me things that I need.
And then the things behind it
Took away the chance forever,

You want me staying ?

Standing by the everyman, digging the rigging on my sail
Rain to the sound of harpsichords, to the spell of fairy tale.
The heath was hung in magic mist, enchanted dripping glades,
I'll taste a taste until my mind drifts from this scene and fades
In the night time.

Crystals sparkles in the grass, I polish them with thought.
On my lash there in my eye a star of light is caught.
Fortunes told in grains of sand, here I am is all I know.
Candy stuck in children's hair, everywhere I go
In the night time.

And solutions must be final
For help gets so unhelpful near the end

Be so quiet ?

And Louise holds a handful of rain, temptin' you to defy it
Lights flicker from the opposite loft
In this room the heat pipes just cough
The country music station plays soft
But there's nothing, really nothing to turn off
Just Louise and her lover so entwined
And these visions of Johanna that conquer my mind.
Inside the museums, Infinity goes up on trial
Voices echo this is what salvation must be like after a while
But Mona Lisa musta had the highway blues
You can tell by the way she smiles
See the primitive wallflower freeze
When the jelly-faced women all sneeze
Hear the one with the mustache say, ""Jeeze
I can't find my knees""
Jewels and binoculars hang from the head of the mule
But these visions of Johanna, they make it all seem so cruel.
The peddler now speaks to the countess who's pretending to care
For him
Sayin', ""Name me someone who's not a parasite and I'll go out and
Say a prayer for him""
But like Louise always says
""Ya can't look at much, can ya man ?""
As she, herself, prepares for him
And Madonna, she still hasn't showed
We see the empty cage now corrode
Where her cape of the stage once had flowed
The fiddler, he now steps on the road
He writes ev'rything's been returned which was owed
On the back of the fish trucks that load
While my conscience explodes
The harmonicas play the skeleton keys and the rain
And these visions of Johanna are now all that remain.

Marianne Faithfull,"Some fools don't know what's right from wrong
But somehow those folks belong
Me, I try for all I'm worth
But I still remain a stranger on this earth

Some people gloom, other folk cry
Me, I have to struggle to keep alive
Ever since the day of my birth
I've been a stranger, stranger on this earth

I try to be what all folks should
Forgetting the bad and doing good
But no matter how I try
My troubles always multiply

Now, I've been doing the best I can
Ever since life began
Some day when I prove my worth
I won't be a stranger on earth

Now I've been living the best I can
Ever since my life began
The day's gonna come when I prove my worth
And I won't be no stranger
No, I won't be a stranger

With hinges on chimneys for stars to go by
A sweet slice of Heaven for just you and I

From all of society, we'll stay aloof
And live in propriety there on the roof
Two heavenly hermits we will be in truth
When we're alone

We'll see life's mad pattern
As we view old Manhattan
Then we can thank our lucky stars
That we're living as we are

In our little penthouse, we'll always contrive
To keep love and romance forever alive
In view of the Hudson just over the drive
When we're alone

If alcohol could take me there
I'd take a shot a minute
And be there by the hour

With a pistol in my suitcase

In a car taking a back seat
Staring out the window
Thinking about danger
Playing in a wrong world
Fighting ¡º but I'm not free
Talking on the telephone
Talking about you and me

I'd fall dawn on my knees

The eyes of Lucy Jordan
In a white suburban bedroom
In a white suburban town

And she lay there 'neath the covers
Dreaming of a thousand lovers
'Til the world turned to orange
And the room went spinning round

At the age of thirty seven
She realized she'd never ride
Through Paris in a sports car
With the warm wind in her hair

So she let the phone keep ringing
And she sat there softly singing
Little nursery rhymes she'd memorized
In her Daddy's easy chair

Her husband, he's off to work
And the kids are off to school
And there were oh so many ways
For her to spend her days

She could clean the house for hours
Or rearrange the flowers
Or run naked through the shady street
Screaming all the way

At the age of thirty seven
She realized she'd never ride
Through Paris in a sports car
With the warm wind in her hair

So she let the phone keep ringing
As she sat there softly singing
Pretty nursery rhymes she'd memorized
In her Daddy's easy chair

The evening sun touched gently on
The eyes of Lucy Jordan
On the rooftop where she climbed
When all the laughter grew too loud

And she bowed and curtsied to the man
Who reached and offered her his hand
And he led her down to the long white car that waited past the crowd

At the age of thirty seven
She knew she'd found forever
As she rode along through Paris
With the warm wind in her hair",The Ballad of Lucy Jordan [Live],1990

What's the panic, where's the static
Do you see me, could you meet me?
I heard the rumor, you've got my number
But now I see you run for cover

So you thought you had it made
Ain't it easy to be afraid?

Marianne Faithfull,"I wish, I wish, I wish in vain,
I wish I were a maid again.
But a maid again I can never be
Until apples grow on an ivy tree.
For love it is pleasin' and love is teasin'
And love is a treasure when first it's new.
But as love grows older, then love grows colder
And it fades away like the morning dew.
There is a little house into town
And there my love, he sits him down.
He takes a strange girl on his knee
And he tells her things that he wants to be.
For love and water make younger older
And love and whiskey make her old and grey.
And what cannot be cured, love, must be endured, love,
And now I am bound for America.
La la la la la la ...
La la la la la la ...
As life grows older sure love grows older
And it fades away like the morning dew.

The boulevard of broken dreams
Where gigolo and gigolette
Can take a kiss without regret
So they forget their broken dreams

You laugh tonight and cry tomorrow
When you behold your shattered schemes
And gigolo and gigolette
Wake up to find their eyes are wet
With tears that tell of broken dreams

Here is where you'll always find me
Always walking up and down
But I left my soul behind me
In an old cathedral town

The joy that you find here, you borrow
You cannot keep it long, it seems
But gigolo and gigolette
Still sing a song and dance along

Maybe once you tip me and it makes you feel swell
In this crummy southern town in this crummy old hotel
But you'll never guess to who you're talkin'.
No, you couldn't ever guess to who you're talkin'

Then one night there's a scream in the night
And you wonder who could that have been?
And you see me kinda grinnin' while I'm scrubbin'
And you say, ""What's she got to grin?"" I'll tell you

There's a ship, The Black Freighter
With a skull on its masthead will be coming in

You gentlemen can say, ""Hey gal, finish them floors!
Get upstairs! What's wrong with you? Earn your keep here!?
You toss me your tips and look out to the ships
But I'm counting your heads as I'm making the beds
'cause there's nobody gonna sleep here, tonight
Nobody is going to sleep here honey

And you say, ""Who's that kicking up a row?""
And you see me kinda starin' out the window
And you say, ""What's she got to stare at now?""
I'll tell you

There's a ship, The Black Freighter turns around in the harbor
Shootin' guns from her bow

Now, you gentlemen can wipe off that smile off your face
'Cause every building in town is a flat one
This whole frickin' place will be down to the ground
Only this cheap hotel standing up safe and sound
And you yell, ""Why do they spare that one?""
Yes, that's what you say, ""Why do they spare that one?""

All the night through, through the noise and to do
You wonder who is that person that lives up there?
And you see me stepping out in the morning
Looking nice with a ribbon in my hair

And the ship, The Black Freighter runs a flag up its masthead
And a cheer rings the air

By noontime the dock is a swarmin' with men
Comin' out from the ghostly freighter
They're movin' in the shadows where no one can see
And they're chainin' up people and they're bringin' 'em to me
Askin' me, ""Kill them now, or later?""
Askin' me, ""Kill them now, or later?""

Noon by the clock and so still by the dock
You can hear a foghorn miles away
And in that quiet of death, I'll say, ""Right now, right now!""
Then they'll pile up the bodies
And I'll say, ""That'll learn ya!""

And the ship, The Black Freighter disappears out to sea
And on it is me

And had nothing to do with the sea.

When I look at my face in the mirror,
There's an old woman staring back at me.

You didn't want love, Johnny,
You wanted cash, Johnny.
But I sewed your lips, Johnny,

As others were ¡º I have not seen
As others saw ¡º I could not bring

My sorrow; I could not awaken
My heart to joy at the same tone;
And all I lov'd, I lov'd alone.
Then ¡º in my childhood ¡º in the dawn
Of a most stormy life ¡º was drawn
From ev'ry depth of good and ill
To mystery which binds me still:
From the torrent, or the fountain,
From the red cliff of the mountain,
From the sun that 'round me roll'd
In it's autumn tint of gold ¡º
From the lightning in the sky
As it pass'd me flying by ¡º
From the thunder and the storm,
And the cloud that took the form
(when the rest of heaven was blue)
Of a demon in my view.

Marianne Faithfull,"It was many and many a year ago,
In a a kingdom by the sea,
That a maiden there lived whom you may know
By the name of Annabel Lee;
And this maiden she lived with no other thought
Than to love and be loved by me;

I was a child and she was a child,
In this kingdom by the sea:
But we loved with a love that was more than love 
I and my Annabel Lee;
With a love that the winged seraphs of heaven
Coveted her and me;

And this was the reason that, long ago,
In this kingdom by the sea,
A wind blew out of a cloud, chilling
My beautiful Annabel Lee;
So that her high-born kinsman came
And bore her away from me,
To shut her up in a sepulcher
In this kingdom by the sea.

The angels, not half so happy in heaven,
Went envying her and me 
Yes! That was the reason (as all men know,
In this kingdom by the sea)
That the wind came out of the cloud by night,
Chilling and killing my Annabel Lee;

But our love it was stronger by far than the love
Of those who were older than we 
Of many far wiser than we 
And neither the angels in heaven above,
Nor the demons down under the sea,
Can ever dissever my soul from the soul
Of the beautiful Annabel Lee,

For the moon never beams, without bringing me dreams
Of the beautiful Annabel Lee;
And the stars never rise, but I feel the bright eyes
Of the beautiful Annabel Lee;
And so, all the night-tide, I lie down by the side
Of my darling my darling my life and my bride,
In the sepulcher there by the sea,
In her tomb by the sounding sea",Annabel Lee,1997

Dreaming of a thousand lovers
'Til the world turned to orange

In her Daddy's easy chair

Her husband, he's off to work
And the kids are off to school
And there were oh so many ways
For her to spend her days

She could clean the house for hours
Or rearrange the flowers
Or run naked through the shady street
Screaming all the way

She realized she'd never ride
Through Paris in a sports car
With the warm wind in her hair

So she let the phone keep ringing
As she sat there softly singing

In her Daddy's easy chair

The evening sun touched gently on
The eyes of Lucy Jordan
On the rooftop where she climbed
When all the laughter grew too loud

And she bowed and curtsied to the man
Who reached and offered her his hand
And he led her down to the long white car that waited past the crowd

Please tell me you believe me, please say
I'll get along without you, anyway.

Was the most fantastic place I've ever known.
For just a dollar you'd get all you wanted,
All you wanted, all you wanted
Of whatever kind of joy you called your own.
But if you had been around to see the sun
Well I don't know you might not like for you to see
The stools at the bar were damp with rye
On the dancefloor the grass grew high,
Through the roof the moon was shining green
And the music really gave you some return on what you paid
Hey Joe, play that old song they always played.

That ol' Bilbao
Down were we used to go
I can't remember the words 
It's so long ago.

I don't know if it would have brought you joy or grief but
It was fantastic
It was fantastic
It was fantastic
Beyhond belief.

Bill's be all in Bilbao, Bilbao, Bilbao,
Came a day the end of May in '98
Four guys from Bristol came with sacks of coal dust,
Sacks of coal dust, sacks of coal dust
And the time they showed us all was really great.
But if you had been around to see the sun
Well I don't know you might not like what you'd've seen.
The brandy bottles smashing through the air
And the chairs flying everywhere
Through the roof the moon's still shining green
And those fog eyes all went going crazy with their pistols blazing
High,
""Think you can stop 'em ? Well, go ahead and try!""

Bill's be all in, Bilbao, Bilbao, Bilbao,
Now they've cleaned it up and made it middle class
With potted palms and aspree
Very bourgeois, very bourgeois
Just another place to put your ass,
But if you could come around to see the fun
Well, I don't know, you might not find it such a strain,
They've cleaned up all the pools of broken glass,
On parquet floors you can't grow grass,
They've shut the green moon out because of rain
And the music makes you cringe now when you think of what you paid
Hey Joe, play that ol' song they always played

Casting it's golden glow
That ol' Bilbao moon
Love never laid me low

These are actors, as I foretold you
We're all spirits, and are melted into air, into thin air

And like the baseless fabric of this vision
The cloud capped towers, the gorgeous palaces
The solemn temples, the great globe itself

Yeah, all which it inherit shall dissolve
And like this insubstantial pageant faded
Leave not a rack behind

And our little life is rounded
With a sleep

Marianne Faithfull,"Anna I

So we saved up, bought ourselves an outfit,
Nighties, nylons, beautiful dresses.
Soon we found a job that was going,
A job as dancer in a cabaret,
A job in memphis, the second big town we came to.

Oh how hard it was for anna!
Beautiful clothes can make a good girl particular ¡º
When the drinking tigress meets herself in the pool,
She's apt to become a menace.

She began talking about art (of all things),
About the art (if you please) of cabaret.
In memphis, the second big town we came to,
It wasn't art that sort of people came for.
That sort of people came for something else;

And when a man has paid for his evening
He expects a good show in return.
So if you cover up your bosom and thighs like you had a rash,
Don't be surprised to see them yawning.

So I told my art-loving sister anna:
""leave your pride to those who can well afford it.
Do what you are asked to do and not what you want,
For that isn't what is wanted.""

Oh but I had trouble, I can tell you,
With her fancy pig-head notions.
Night by night I sat by her bedside,
Holding her hand and saying this:
""think of our little house in louisiana!""

Wins the palm, gains the crown.

Marianne Faithfull,"Midway, this way of life we're bound upon
I woke to find myself in a dark wood
Where the right road was wholly lost and gone

Aye me, how hard to speak of it
That rude and rough and stubborn forest
The mere breath of memory stirs the old fear in the blood

But when, at last, I stood beneath a steep hillside
Which closed that valley's wandering maze
Whose dread had pierced me to the heart root deep

Then I looked up and saw the morning rays
Mantle its shoulder from that planet bright
Which guides men's feet aright on all their ways

He was rather over-hearty and ridiculous
But as I'd seen him on the screen he cast a certain spell.

For a couple of hours or so.
His manners were a fraction too meticulous,
If he was real or not, I couldn't tell,
But like a silly fool I fell

I know it's stupid

I'm so ashamed of it

I've had about the boy.

He melts my foolish heart

That here and there
Are traces of that cared about the boy.

I really shouldn't care.
Lord knows I'm not a schoolgirl
In the flurry of her first affair.
Will it ever cloy
This odd diversity of misery and joy
I'm feeling quite insane
And young again
And all because
I'm mad about the boy.

It seems a little silly
For a girl of my age and weight
To walk down piccadilly in a haze of light.
It ought to take her a good deal more
To take a bad girl down.
I should've been exempt for my particular kind of fate
As taught me such contempt for every phase of love
And now I've been and spent my love torn crown
To weep about a painted clown.

Mad about the boy,
It's pretty funny
But I'm mad about the boy.
He has a gay appeal that makes me feel
There's maybe something sad about the boy.

Walking down the street
His eyes look out at me from people that I meet.
I can't believe it's true,
But when I'm blue, in some strange way
I'm glad about the boy.

I'm hardly sentimental,
Love isn't so sublime.
I have to pay my rental
And I can't afford to waste much time.
If I could employ a little magic
That would finally destroy
This dream that pains me and it shames me
But I can't because I'm mad about the boy.",Mad About the Boy,1999

Stains the sheets with memory and lust

If I could tell my story in a song
I'd have to make it fast, yes, it's very long
Many shades of gray between the right and wrong

Day for night, night for day
All the stories on this way
Feel the fire burn away

So turn the lights down low, come over here
Stay with me, don't go, you'll see my characters appear
The storyteller's magic doesn't lie
He'll make you laugh to make you cry
Real for me is real for you
What I say is almost true

All the stories on its way
Feel the fire burn and play

I cross the floor and I'm high and I'm rich

I loved you baby, way back when
And all the bridges are burning that we might have crossed
But I feel so close to everything that we lost
We'll never , we'll never have to lose it again.

Well I bid you farewell, I don't know when I'll be back
They're moving us tomorrow to that tower down the track
But you'll be hearing from me baby, long after I'm gone

Angels have no thought of ever returning you
Would they be angry if I thought of joining you?

Gloomy is Sunday--with shadows I spend it all
My heart and I have decided to end it all
Soon there'll be candles and prayers that are sad I know
Let them not weep; let them know that I'm glad to go
Death is no dream, for in death I'm caressing you
With the last breath of my soul I'll be blessing you

Oh, suburban shits who want some class
All queue up to kiss my ass

A way to piss your life against the wall
Go ahead why don't you leave me to these thugs
And creeps who want to fuck a nun on drugs?

Is it such a sin I never ever tried too hard?
I had to know how far was going too far
In proper homes throughout the land, Fathers try to understand
Why Eunice who is seventeen aspires to live her life like me

Oh no, can't ya see, Daddy?

Like how to fall from grace and slide with elegance from a pedestal
