Nate Dogg,"Nobody does it better makes me feel sad for the rest
Nobody does it half as good as you
Baby, you're the best
I wasn't lookin' but somehow you found me
I tried to hide from your love light
But like heaven above me the spy who loved me 
Is keepin' all my secrets safe tonight
 
Nobody does it better sometimes I wish someone could
Nobody does it quite the way you do
Did you have to be so good?
The way that you hold me whenever you hold me
There's some kind of magic inside you
That keeps me from runnin' but just keep it comin'  
How'd you learn to do the things you do?
 
And nobody does it better 
Makes me feel sad for the rest
Nobody does it half as good as you",Nobody Does It Better [7Ä Edit],2006
Nate Dogg,"I'm from the old hood, somethin' like yo' hood
Where niggas don't know good, or know Suge, but the blow good
So we rock it like Tracy McGrady
Send it to Houston in a gray Mercedes
I'm a product of my environment, grew up in the 80's
So that mean, me Kanyeezy and Young Jeezy all crack babies
And it's evident my flow is heaven-sent
First LP, on the same shelf as the veterans
Nigga I can't be fucked, like a lesbian
I'm to hip-hop what Cartoon is to Mexicans
I'm an artist, never claimed to be the hardest
Just number one since B.I.G. and Pac departed
Nate ridin' with me, Snoop ridin' with me
All you other niggas used to be good like Ken Griffey
I'm on fire like the tip of a blunt
On fire like a nigga that let it drip for a month
I'm a Blood, you can Crip if you want, just let it bump
Like you got Scott Storch tied up in the trunk
I'm the ice cream truck man, guns in the trunk man
Drugs in the trunk man, call me the front man

Too much Cris' in the club not to get drunk
Too many bitches in the world not to fuck
Too much chronic in the studio not to roll it up
And too much bass in the trunk, so let it bump
You look like you mad as fuck, but who cares?
Grabbin' her by the arm, cause she stared
Don't know how much attention you pay
You better be ready to die, in this game

I thought I told y'all
I'm done with the beef, clown, my son three now
And I've been watchin' Dre so long I'm makin' beats now
Game on the rebound like Ben Wallace in the D-Town
I mean Chi-Town, fuck it, it can go down
Nigga I spit the whole round, fo' plus fo' pounds
Nigga this the wild wild West, call it a showdown
And I'm Billy the Kid 'til they split my wig
I come back from the dead, tell 'em kill me again
Put my head on a barrel, dare a nigga to shoot me
I'm gangsta, took more shots than Tookie
I'm alive, so I'mma take a Patron shot for Tookie
Roll a California blunt and keep watchin' a movie
Inspired by this gangbangin' shit since I was two
I brought the West coast back, what the fuck you do?
I'm the ice cream truck man, guns in the trunk man
Drugs in the trunk man, call me the front man

Too much Cris' in the club not to get drunk
Too many bitches in the world not to fuck
Too much chronic in the studio not to roll it up
And too much bass in the trunk, so let it bump
You look like you mad as fuck, but who cares?
Grabbin' her by the arm, cause she stared
Don't know how much attention you pay
You better be ready to die, in this game

Drive fast, both hands on the dash
Close both of your eyes and hope that you don't crash
It's lyrical homicide, both airbags out
Roll the fuckin' windows down, let the bass out
Niggas, drop the top on whatever you in
Bitches, let your ponytail blow in the wind
Inhale the chronic, blow out dollar signs
Nigga you can drive a Bentley if only in your mind
Four doors, leather and wood
Ride like I got a horse stable under my hood
And I keep a chrome fo'five under my hood
So if I die, nigga bury me under my hood
Who had the hottest bitch in the game, wearin' they chain
Mr. H to the Izzo, Nas and Hurricane
Long as my family straight, read this at my wake
I gave 'em The Documentary and they scraped the plate
Twenty magazine covers, nigga look at his face
I can not, will not ever be replaced
Cause I'm the ice cream truck man, guns in the trunk man
Drugs in the trunk man, call me the front man

Too much Cris' in the club not to get drunk
Too many bitches in the world not to fuck
Too much chronic in the studio not to roll it up
And too much bass in the trunk, so let it bump
You look like you mad as fuck, but who cares?
Grabbin' her by the arm, cause she stared
Don't know how much attention you pay
You better be ready to die, in this game

He wolfin' a lot of shit, he look scared
You can't find your girl, she right here
I'm not a bad dream, I'm a nightmare

There she goes shaking that ass on the floor
Bumpin' and grindin' that pole
The way she's grindin' that pole
I think I'm losing control
Bobby Creek

I'm on the Patron
In the end I'm gone
My eyes ain't clear
I'm gone
So she hear me wrong
I'm kinda in the zone
Cause the D-J playin' my song
Just another opportunity for sayin' I'm known
I'm from Atlanta
So southern ain't just part of my grammar
I can up and cock the hammer
For any nigga wherevera
But I came here to get on goose and Tropicana
Get loose put some more of my juice
In your caboose
Sippin' everything from white grain
To deuce juice
With nothin' to gain
But my grace and loose tooths
Eminem came Obie, Stat and Proof too
Bobby Creek is in the place
The name is Snoop too
???
My drinks is ten around
I can make her spin around
If she keep her dinner down
Simmer down
We can hit the telly when the fun stops
And I let you and your ?
Come tickle my gumdrops

I met a bad bitch last night in the D
Let me tell you how I made her leave with me
Conversation and Hennessey
I've been to the muthafuckin' mountain top
Heard muthafuckers talk, seen 'em drop
If I ain't got a weapon I'm a pick up a rock
And when I bust yo ass I'm gonna continue to rock
Get yo ass off the wall with your two left feet
It's real easy just follow the beat
Don't let that fine girl pass you by
Look real close 'cause strobe lights lie
We 'bout to have a party (turn the music up)
Let's get it started (Go head shake your butt)
I'm lookin' for a girl with a body and a sexy strut
Wanna get it poppin' baby step right up
Some girls they act retarded
Some girls are 'bout it 'bout it
I'm lookin' for a girl
That will do whatever the fuck
I say everyday she be givin' it up

Shake that ass for me
Shake that ass for me
Come on girl, shake that ass for me
Shake that ass for me
Oh girl, shake that ass for me
Shake that ass for me
Come on girl, shake that ass for me
Shake that ass for me

Obie Trice!

One slug
Couldn't snuff young cause
Goodness gracious
Haters stay on these nuts
Just like a hood rat chick who was curious
Serious
Full breast, ready to touch
Who's that in the cool blue back
With a new rag
Givin' head while he poppin' the clutch
True that I had a few
Obie rollin' with brews
Annually knockin' the boots
It's on manual
The way I knock 'em outta they shoes
Talk a little shit
Then they anus'll ooze
Talk a little spit on my ding-a-lang
Who
It's Shady
You know the name of the crew
You know the aim is to bang you
In the mansion
With a magnum
With a night pass to the matinee
Obie
Came to party
You better ask somebody

Shake that ass for me, shake that ass for me
Come on girl, shake that ass for me
Shake that ass for me

Nate Dogg,"(From hard times)
All of my life, got this lady on my mind
(To good times)
All of my days, wanna hit it all the time
(She's fine)
Struggle and strife, I was down and locked away
(She's mine)
Thought about it every day
(From hard times)

You know a nigga wanna touch your body
We can keep in touch, have an after party
You know you wanna fuck 'cause you're acting naughty
You see us in the mattress probably

Wanna be involved 'cause the entourage I'm indulged in
You say you love my dirty drawers, you're all in
Wanna sleep with the star, be baby moms, eat lobster
See where you're coming from

'Cause hey, that nigga got dick for days
And ain't too many niggas blessed in O?s ways I guess
I just get better with old age
'Cause in my hey, puss made me say ?Mayday?

Anyway, today I'm a different human being
I crush 'em, make 'em scream
It's nothing, ain't a thing
Fronting like the dick ain't off the chain
Slicing nigga?s [incomprehensible], c'mon

(From hard times)
At the after party we can get naughty, watching your body
(To good times)
Get this shit started, coke and Bacardi, [incomprehensible] juice and gin
And I'm off that ready to roll
(It's high time)
At the after party, it?s a private party
What happens at the party, stays at the party
(Blue sky)
Girl go on and party, back up that body into my body, girl let's go
(From hard times)

You know I'm somewhere where I can ease my mind be
On some island Don Ps beside me
No paparazzi eying that hiney
But I am right behind she

Wanna bump 'n grind, crying, sayin' I'm all up in that side
Bringing down the menstruation cycle
Girl I lay pipe to the right, pipe to the left
Pipe all night, a pipe dream, right?

O Trice advice your type
If it ain't him, it?s a nigga in my click you like
If the misses insist on a dick tonight
We throw assists like Scott Pip and Mike

You blow a kiss on my tip you just might
Get a whiff of the kid up in your windpipe
Now see that insight? It excites
'Cause she's undressing for that sex, right?

(From hard times)
At the after party we can get naughty, watching your body
(To good times)
Get this shit started, coke and Bacardi, [incomprehensible] juice and gin
And I'm off that ready to roll
(It's high time)
At the after party, it?s a private party
What happens at the party, stays at the party
(Blue sky)
Girl go on and party, back up that body into my body, girl let's go
(From hard times)

Take time off my hectic schedule
Just to give you the pleasure you request for
When I hit your spine that's how you measure O
Tell your girlfriends you ain't had it like this before

Now your girlfriends all up in the midst of O
Wanna be mistress, all 'cause a few extra inches
Blew back your interest, you lack experience
New jack my crew ran through that for instance

We can fuck from dusk to dawn
'S no discussion whose nuts you're on
To me she's such in a rush to cum
Wanna choke on the dong, like it?s a bong

And what is he doing? You're making her moan
You make her wanna leave that muthafucka she got back home
All O knowing is he keeps hoes going, enjoying O Trice?s groin

(From hard times)
At the after party we can get naughty, watching your body
(To good times)
Get this shit started, coke and Bacardi, [incomprehensible] juice and gin
And I'm off that ready to roll
(It's high time)
At the after party, it?s a private party
What happens at the party, stays at the party
(Blue sky)
Girl go on and party, back up that body into my body, girl let's go
(From hard times)

All of my life, got this lady on my mind
(To good times)
All of my days, wanna hit it all the time
(It's high time)
Struggle and strife, I was down and locked away

Thought about it every day

Tonight's the night for me to rip microphones 
Into bits and pieces lyrical telekinesis 
Gets me into verbally vindictive 
Violent vocabulary bobs to existence 
Catch me in the pitch black path 
I sit and let the sick thought pass through my mental 
Till I hear an instrumental 
And detrimental verbals get to spittin' 
The highest in intellect, try connectin' with the written

To explore new terrain, then remain unseen, throughout the war

Who see a young nigga getting plently dough man
Icy Audemar, Hendy gold band
With a mean girl like Lindsay Lohan
That's why I keep the 9 in the Bentley door pan
Trust it's gon' bust you roll on us
Know it's gon' blow for my dough
Why would you try with that guy
Scene told you he keep it G
We can bang like the two chains on my neck
The hood is Iraq I'm Hussein in the 'jects
The coupe's up take the new Lame for a sec
12"" up, new cane in the deck nigga
Right now with a squeezer and a coozie
And I'm goin out like Keyshia with the uzi

[Chorus]
They talk about it, we all about it
They making plans, we sit and counting
Our cheddar stack it's just like a mountain
You heard about it 'cause she running her mouth
She want's to ride, and she's trying to hide it
I'm cool as ever, she's too excited
Her man look like, he want to fight
But he ain't doing nothing, but running his mouth

Fuck around and feel the fury of a high nigga
When I get busy throw your hands in the sky nigga
I got the illest of the ill mentality, niggas be grabbing me
Knowing that they'd rather be stabbing me
All up in my back trying to take my track
When I used to sell crack I ain't had problems like that
Street rules, watch your pockets and your jewels
A nigga front, throw the gat to the fool
Necks wanna move but's getting blasted
Streets to a flows from the ill ghetto bastard
As I release masterpieces like adhesive
Stuck to your ass, like tissue when your wiping fast
MC's have a hard time believing
I mark with death, hard to kill like Steven
When Jake come I'm leaving, the black man's motto
You got a better chance playing lotto
What you want nigga?

[Chorus]

Ah, Yo
Now watch me dip-dip-di-dive all over the beat
Now watch me drip-drip-dri-di all over the street
The general consensus is you'll be the dominating fleet
Bitch raw, and let me continue to bring the heat
You know who been the kings of the block, the kings of the drops
The kings of the crap music and the kings of the cross
Niggas fire then drop shit like the purest of powder
That's why most of these niggas little song be sounding like ours
Couple years ago, niggas probably thought I was dying
Now same niggas are idolizing put our face in the shrine
Yeah I took a little time to cook and show you what's really hot
How the fuck any of you niggas think you feeling my spot
Why you niggas getting mad at us, we shit on your floors
All in your house nigga, our strategies is different from yours
Listen, you come you can do it while I continue to preach
Snoop, fam, bigger Bust of the stand if you can't reach

[Chorus]

Uhhh, uhhh
Fox then B.I.G.
Who fucking with Fox, who want it with I
Bust a shot for me and Big from the villfredo sky
Got my Joan Fross shit on, hop off my dick
Canary bangle-round I ain't gon' 20 carrots on this bitch
Pull up the Phantom, show 'em how we switch
From the Bentley blinds spur kill 'em with the six
Bed-Stuy what up y'all, what up with your girl
How she leave dude broke tell them boys on work
I'm in the G5 Jedi, Brooklyn what's your chrome
'Cause that niggas lying home if the tutti with the dead-eye
My nigga Neck got hit up in his truck
And no Stranel ain't the same since Homo got touched
Nasty with the pistol, nasty with the clit
See I'm a beast with it, fucking 'til I'm crippled
Ill nuns squeezing the lhama
Bog roll dutty, Fox and Poppa

Run for your gun you suckers
B.I.G. I'm a get them motherfuckers
Don't you worry about a thing, bang-bang-boogie
I got a few chickens that's gon' work that noggie
In the lack with a sack go and put it on the mat

Uh, turning it out, run in your house

See I'm a visitor I'm a LA guest
I got to be aware on how the LA dress
'Cause if it comes down I might get LA stretched
I ain't trying to be a trophy on no LA desk
Some niggas walk up tossing LA sets
I guess this supposed to be some type of LA test
Better watch the girls with the LA chest
A lot of plastic in those LA breasts
I hit the Crenshaw where they LA stunt
Seen a lot of sixty four's and LA trucks
Seen a lot of girls with them LA butts
A lot of niggas with them dickies and chucks (ya feel me)

Yo I spend a lot of time on this LA coast
Out here trying to do the LA most

In the back with a drink take a LA toast
I spend a lot of time in them LA heels
With them models actresses and them LA heels
To my lawyers office for a LA deal
Cut the check for some LA kneels
Now I'm off to Rodeo just to LA shop
Still getting dirty looks from some LA cops
You than thought since Rodney King LA stopped
When they burn the LA watts
I send a lot of love to my LA brothers
My Latinos and my Negroes in them LA colors
My blessings go out to those LA mothers
Know that Nelly is an LA lover

Guess who just stepped in the place (the Midwest)

When my squad walks in
Throw up your hands baby buy me a drink, stop acting phony
Don't forget to bring something for all my homies

For the bitch that said I shot some shit up out of my dick
Now she sick, she better lay low
For the niggas who be claiming my hood
And really ain't from my gang, better lay low
I hope he don't be thinking I'm just talking
And I won't do a thing, really hope so!

Lay low, nobody move until I say so

See I don't go to clubs, I never chase a bitch (bitch)
I'm here to bang that gangsta shit to the apocalypse
We call it stress, some of y'all call it chocolate
Return of the top dogg, and ain't no stopping this
Whatever the case, I ain't trying to catch it
Lay low, blow big dope, and slang records
Unseen but well heard, do not disturb
The only reason you alive 'cause I ain't sent the word
I flip, faster than birds, Snoop Dogg will emerge
From the smoke and go loc, you shouldn't provoke
I bring the worst from the L.B.C.
Smash motherfuckers thinking they goin' smash on me
Snoop and Dre give a fuck about what y'all say
From the ""world's most dangerous group""  N.W.A.

Our rise, it was no surprise
I always knew these fools would trip
Hating, faking, scheming on mine
And on the down low talking shit
Best move 'cause I refuse to lose
No matter which damn road I choose
So lay low 'cause you might be bruised
Top story on the evening news
I ain't for games, so if you wanna play 'em lay low
Lay down on the floor
I'm in a rage, so if we gotta do this let me know
That's what I came fo'

Where that nigga who be talking shit?
He don't come around no more because I fucked his bitch
I made her suck my dick, while I was squeezing the tits
Then I hit it from the back, gripped tight on them hips
She tried to make me cum, but I was trying to take her home
Dropped you off and seen you fishing on your raggedy brougham
Could of thumped you and the dog (you little fag)
And don't sag too hard, you show everybody your thong

We bring it straight to ya
From 22's to Luger's the shit that shoot through ya
Who you motherfuckers think the top dogg bang with?
The same click he came with and made the game flip
Now niggas grow they hair, hope they staying act hard
That's even tho' yo' CEO talk shit get slapped hard
The backyard is where we get our scrap on
The black car drive by then you get capped on

Whats up pimping?  It's P and Snoop
With Dre on the beat, this ain't nothing but loot
They call me Jed Clampett for all the bread I got
But they call me Bill Clinton for all the head I got
I keeps it real-ah, 'cause I'm all about my scrilla
The ladies love me 'cause I'm a million dollar hitta
It's, no limit til I d-I-e

Nate Dogg,"It was a clear black night, a clear white moon
Warren G was on the streets, trying to consume
Some skirts for the eve so I can get some funk
Just rolling in my ride, chilling all alone

Just hit the east side of the LBC
On a mission trying to find Mr. Warren G
Seen a car full of girls, ain't no need to tweak
All you skirts know what's up with 2-1-3

So I hooks a left on 2-1 and Lewis
Some brothers shooting dice so I said ""let's do this""
I jumped out the ride and said ""what's up?""
Some brothers pulled some Gats, so I said ""I'm stuck""

Since these girls peeping me, I'mma glide and swerve
These hookers looking so hard they straight hit the curb
On to big better things than some horny tricks
I see my homey and some suckers all in his mix

I'm getting jacked, I'm breaking myself
I can't believe they're taking Warren's wealth
They took my rings, they took my Rolex
I looked at the brother said ""damn, what's next?""

They got my homey hemmed up and they all around
Ain't none of them seeing if they going straight pound-for-pound
I've got to come up real quick before they start to clown
I best pull out my strap and lay them busters down

They've got guns to my head
I think I'm going down
I can't believe this happening in my own town
If I had wings I would fly
Let me contemplate
I glanced in the cut and I see my homey Nate

16 in the clip and one in the hole
Nate Dogg is about to make some bodies turn cold
Now they dropping and yelling
It's a tad bit late
Nate Dogg and Warren G had to regulate

I laid all them busters down, I let my Gat explode
Now I'm switching my mind back into freak-mode
If you want skirts, sit back and observe
I just left a gang of those over there on the curb

Now Nate got the freaks, and that's a known fact
Before I got jacked I was on the same track
Back up, back up cause it's on
N-A-T-E and me: the Warren to the G

Just like I thought
They were in the same spot
In need of some desperate help
But Nate Dogg and the G-child
Were in need of something else
One of them dames was sexy as hell
I said ooh, I like your size
She said my car's broke down and you seem real nice
Would you let me ride
I got a car full of girls and it's going real swell
The next stop is the Eastside Motel

I'm tweaking into a whole new era
G-Funk, step to this, I dare ya
Funk on a whole new level

The rhythm is the bass and the bass is the treble

Chords, strings, we brings
Melody, G-Funk
Where rhythm is life
And life is rhythm

You don't wanna step to this

'Til the day that I drop you'll never say that I'm not killing 'em
'Cause when I am not then I'm a stop pinning them
And I am not hip-hop and I'm just not Eminem
Subliminal thoughts when I'm stop sending them
Women are caught in webs spin and hock venom
Adrenaline shots of penicillin could not get the illin' to stop
Amoxicillin is just not real enough
The criminal cop killing hip-hop filling a
Minimal swap to cop millions of Pac listeners
You're coming with me, feel it or not
You're gonna fear it like I showed you the spirit of god lives in us
You hear it a lot, lyrics that shock, is it a miracle
Or am I just a product of pop fizzing up
For shizzle my whizzle this is the plot listen up
You Bizzles forgot Slizzle does not give a fuck

'Til the roof comes off, till the lights go out
'Til my legs give out, can't shut my mouth.
'Til the smoke clears out and my high perhaps
I'm a rip this shit till my bone collapse.

'Til the roof comes off, till the lights go out
'Til my legs give out, can't shut my mouth.
'Til the smoke clears out and my high perhaps
I'm a rip this shit till my bone collapse.

Music is like magic there's a certain feeling you get
When you're real and you spit and people are feeling your shit
This is your moment and every single minute you spittin'
Trying to hold onto it 'cause you may never get it again
So while you're in it try to get as much shit as you can
And when your run is over just admit when it's at its end
'Cause I'm at the end of my wits with half the shit that gets in
I got a list, here's the order of my list that it's in;
It goes, Reggie, Jay-Z, Tupac and Biggie
Andre from Outkast, Jada, Kurupt, Nas and then me
But in this industry I'm the cause of a lot of envy
So when I'm not put on this list the shit does not offend me
That's why you see me walk around like nothing's bothering me
Even though half you people got a fuckin' problem with me
You hate it but you know respect you've got to give me
The press's wet dream like Bobby and Whitney, Nate hit me

'Til the roof comes off, till the lights go out
'Til my legs give out, can't shut my mouth.
'Til the smoke clears out and my high perhaps
I'm a rip this shit till my bone collapse.

'Til the roof comes off, till the lights go out
'Til my legs give out, can't shut my mouth.
'Til the smoke clears out and my high perhaps
I'm a rip this shit till my bone collapse.

Soon as a verse starts I eat at an MC's heart
What is he thinking? Enough to not go against me, smart
And its absurd how people hang on every word
I'll probably never get the props I feel I ever deserve
But I'll never be served my spot is forever reserved
If I ever leave earth that would be the death of me first
'Cause in my heart of hearts I know nothing could ever be worse
That's why I'm clever when I put together every verse
My thoughts are sporadic, I act like I'm an addict
I rap like I'm addicted to smack like I'm Kim Mathers
But I don't want to go forth and back in constant battles
The fact is I would rather sit back and bomb some rappers'
So this is like a full blown attack I'm launching at 'em
The track is on some battling raps who want some static
'Cause I don't really think that the fact that I'm Slim matters
A plaque of platinum status is whack if I'm not the baddest

'Til the roof comes off, till the lights go out
'Til my legs give out, can't shut my mouth.
'Til the smoke clears out and my high perhaps
I'm a rip this shit till my bone collapse.

'Til the roof comes off, till the lights go out
'Til my legs give out, can't shut my mouth.
'Til the smoke clears out and my high perhaps
I'm a rip this shit till my bone collapse.

Until the roof (Until the roof)
The roof comes off (The roof comes off)
Until my legs (Until my legs)
Give out from underneath me (Underneath me, I)

I will not fall
I will stand tall

And suddenly your sighing sighs
You're thinking nothing's wrong
You string along, boy, then snap!

Those eyes, those sighs, they're part of the tender trap
You're hand in hand beneath the trees
And soon there's music in the breeze
You're acting kind of smart, until your heart just goes wap!

Those trees, that breeze, they're part of the tender trap
Some starry night, when her kisses make you tingle
She'll hold you tight, and you'll hate yourself for being single

And all at once it seems so nice
The folks are throwing shoes and rice
You hurry to a spot, that's just a dot on the map

You're hooked, you're cooked, you're caught in the tender trap
Some starry night, when her kisses make you tingle
She'll hold you tight, and you'll hate yourself for being single

And all at once it seems so nice
The folks are throwing shoes and rice
You hurry to a spot that's just a dot on the map

And then you wonder how it all came about
It's too late now there's no gettin' out
You fell in love, and love is the tender trap",The Tender Trap,1993

Nate Ginsberg Trio,"Walked with no one and talked with no one
And I had nothing but shadows
Then one morning you passed
And I brightened at last
Now I greet the day and complete the day
With the sun in my heart
All my worry blew away
When you taught me how to say

Grab your coat and get your hat
Leave your worry on the doorstep
Just direct your feet
To the sunny side of the street
Can't you hear a pitter-pat?
And that happy tune is your step
Life can be so sweet
On the sunny side of the street

I used to walk in the shade
With those blues on parade
But I'm not afraid
This Rover crossed over

If I never have a cent
I'd be rich as Rockefeller
Gold dust at my feet

Nate Ruess,"Mom
I know I let you down
And though you say the days are happy
Why is the power off, and I'm fucked up?
And mom, I know he's not around
But don't you place the blame on me
As you pour yourself another drink and

I guess we are who we are
Headlights shining in the dark night, I drive on
Maybe we took this too far

I went in headfirst
Never thinking about who what I said hurt, in what verse
My mom probably got it the worst
The brunt of it, but as stubborn as we are
Did I take it too far?
Cleaning out my closet and all them other songs
But regardless I don't hate you 'cause ma!
You're still beautiful to me, cause you're my mom
Though far be it for you to be calling, my house was Vietnam
Desert Storm and both of us put together
Can form an atomic bomb equivalent to chemical warfare
And forever we can drag this on and on
But, agree to disagree
That gift from me up under the Christmas tree don't mean shit to me
You're kicking me out? It's fifteen degrees and it's Christmas Eve (little prick just leave)
Ma, let me grab my fucking coat, anything to have each other's goats
Why we always at each others throats? Especially when dad, he fucked us both
We're in the same fucking boat, you'd think that it'd make us close (nope)
Further away that drove us, but together headlights shine, a car full of belongings
Still got a ways to go, back to grandma's house it's straight up the road
And I was the man of the house, the oldest, so my shoulders carried the weight of the load
Then Nate got taken away by the state at eight years old, and
That's when I realized you were sick and it wasn't fixable or changeable
And to this day we remained estranged and I hate it though, but

I guess we are who we are
Headlights shining in the dark night I drive on
Maybe we took this too far

'Cause to this day we remain estranged and I hate it though
'Cause you ain't even get to witness your grand baby's growth
But I'm sorry mama for 'Cleaning Out My Closet', at the time I was angry
Rightfully maybe so, never meant that far to take it though, 'cause
Now I know it's not your fault, and I'm not making jokes
That song I no longer play at shows and I cringe every time it's on the radio
And I think of Nathan being placed in a home
And all the medicine you fed us
And how I just wanted you to taste your own, but
Now the medications taken over and your mental states deteriorating slow
And I'm way too old to cry, that shit's painful though
But ma, I forgive you, so does Nathan yo
All you did, all you said, you did your best to raise us both
Foster care, that cross you bare, few may be as heavy as yours
But I love you Debbie Mathers, oh what a tangled web we have, 'cause
One thing I never asked was where the fuck my deadbeat dad was
Fuck it I guess he had trouble keeping up with every address
But I'd have flipped every mattress, every rock and desert cactus
Own a collection of maps and followed my kids to the edge of the atlas
Someone ever moved them from me? That you could bet your ass's
If I had to come down the chimney dressed as Santa, kidnap them
And although one has met their grandma
Once you pulled up in our drive one night as we were leaving to get some hamburgers
Me, her and Nate, we introduced you, hugged you
And as you left I had this overwhelming sadness come over me
As we pulled off to go our separate paths, and
I saw your headlights as I looked back
And I'm mad I didn't get the chance to thank you for being my Mom and my Dad
So Mom, please accept this as a tribute I wrote this on the jet
I guess I had to get this off my chest, I hope I get the chance to lay it before I'm dead
The stewardess said to fasten my seat belt, I guess we're crashing
So if I'm not dreaming, I hope you get this message that I'll always love you from afar
'Cause you're my mama

I guess we are who we are
Headlights shining in the dark night I drive on
Maybe we took this too far

I want a new life
One without a cause
So I'm coming home tonight
Well no matter what the cost
And if the plane goes down
Or if the crew can't wake me up
Just know that I was alright
And I was not afraid to die

Oh even if there's songs to sing
My children will carry me
Just know that I'm alright
I was not afraid to die
Because I put my faith in my new girl
So I never say goodbye cruel world
Just know that I'm alright
I am not afraid to die

I guess we are who we are
Headlights shining in the dark night I drive on
Maybe we took this too far, I want a new life",Headlights,2013

Left you, falling on the floor
Headed for the door
Went straight to Philidelphia
Oh no, what have I begun?
Called my mother, said I love her
Had another and another one
Questions, questions, suddenly suggestions
Where was anyone at the start of this thing?
Hold that gold up over your shoulder
All I needs a place to grieve

Oh, it’s for the best you didn’t listen
It’s for the best we get our distance (oh oh woah oh)
It’s for the best you didn’t listen
It’s for the best we get our distance

Oh lord, I feel alive
I've gone and saved my soul
If all that you read is everything you believe
Then let go, then let go, then let go

Now I’m over my head
Acting like I never started over again
I am the city I’m from
Always wanting more than just a word on my arm
Oh, I know, I can’t believe
That I'd let it get to me
Good to know I won’t become
Everything I’m afraid of

Oh, it’s for the best you didn’t listen
It’s for the best we get our distance (oh oh woah oh)

If all that you read is everything you believe
Then let go, then let go, then let go

Mama don’t cry
I was once your little baby boy
So full of love and light
By the time I turned 25
I was lost among the pavement
Lower than the basement
And I couldn’t stand to smile
I thought of taking my own life
But mama don’t cry
I found songs among the tragic
Hung my hat on sadness
Mom, I think they’re trying to keep the grand romantic in me
Now that we got bottom lines
But mom, I think I’m ready to free this grand romantic in me

I watched you walk slow past my window
Is that what you did it for?
I think it's best you left me alone
You know I'm bound to make you cry
From up here I can see the Carlyle
I can see the Louvre shining in your eyes
I never meant to set the world on fire
Just wanted something you'd remember me by

But now I wish that I was on the bright side
These friends of mine could spend the whole night dreaming
While you're holding me tight under the moonlight
Just you and I, we'll lead a new life singing
La la la

You know, I think it says a lot
That I could wake myself up from this dream
Grab the things that are most dear to me
And although I could have loved you better
I had to get the fuck out of the bed
Cause there's just something about you my love
Something in the way you comb your hair
And fall apart at the seams
When you were young I used to throw you down
You'd show me how it feels to feel

Oh God, I wish that I was on the bright side

While you're holding me tight under the moonlight

Holding our own in a great big storm
It’s a great big storm and we’re holding our own
Holding our own in a great big storm
It’s a great big storm and we’re holding our own

I’ve been lost in this maze
Losing love, losing friends
Losing faith in chemicals
Afraid one day you’ll find me
Asleep above the stars
I watch my mother cry
Father Time is catching up
I keep the phone by my side
Afraid she’ll wake me up to catch the next flight
In time to say goodbye

But sometimes I fall asleep at night
To the TV light and it sings
Oh ooo whoa oh
One day the sun will break into the room

Because we’re holding our own in a great big storm
And though we’re cutting it close
We won’t let go
Oh no I can’t believe

Through mistakes that I can’t change
Because there’s beauty in every sin
Every single black eye
Has some blue like the moon just before the sun shines

And all the curse words that fall from my mouth
I can’t stand myself
Or my legs as they run from the ones here to help

Some new air to breathe
And a belief that it’s all gonna be alright

My mother placed a dozen thorns
The sorry's and the take it back's
Lay silent in her folded hands and
Head to headstone I just danced
Oblivious to consequence
As morning sank into the ground
The highest branch I sorted out

Oh, I didn't mean to let it go
I didn't mean to bruise but I lost control
And when she said to me it's still a ghost[?]

All your love may fade away
All you'll become may all go to waste
So I can't stand to hear you say it hurts
When it only gets much worse
It only gets much worse

Oh you caught me come to life
The moment when your eyes met mine
And from your bed, the sun came in
And to this day it never set
But here's to this I'm used to it[?]
I stepped out for some cigarettes
The neon lights they called me in
Her eyes like yours, just different

And no, I didn't mean to let you go
I didn't mean to bruise but I lost control
What didn't mean a thing destroyed us both

All you'll become may all go to waste

It takes its toll[?]
I survived
The laws of gravity
Destroyed some property
I would not let them sink their teeth into my soul

All I become may all go to waste

Looking for a light when you saved me
I was convinced no one would take me

All of your sighs are saying ""Go, please""
""Leave me alone and leave you lonely""
It looks as though we've reached the end

Well, I'm fine
I just need a moment
I'm alright right here on the floor
Well, I'm fine
I just need a moment to cry

And when I think about the ways
That you never waste your breath to say you love me
How you always held your lost loves above me
As you kept your other hand on the door
Yet I'll admit I might miss
Every scar and every wish that we'd make
But our wishes were nothing but ways
To act as if we could use the change
Well, maybe one of these days
We'll cross each other on a train to our new lives
We could talk about the old times
And how we're glad we made it out alive

But for now I'll sit and drink
As I think about the night that your father died
And I said I'd never leave your side
We once swore we could defeat this
Therefore, please excuse this little bit of weakness, oh

Well, I'm fine
I just need a moment of your time
To get all my things and let go
Well, I’m fine
I just need a moment to say goodbye

Just to watch it fly

We're never gettin' into Harvard or Carnegie Mellon
And we gon' end up either robbin' somebody or killin'
It's not fair that's all they can tell us
That's why you hustle hella hard, never celebrate a holiday
That'll be the day I coulda finally hit the lottery
I refuse to ever lose or throw my shot away
Or chalk it up as just another one that got away
So I'm unapologetic, I'm on my calesthenics
If I have given it all I got I cannot regret it
My point of destination's different from where I was headed
'Cause I'ma shoot for the stars to get it, one shot

I said I'm not throwin' away my shot
I said I'm not throwin' away my shot
Yo, I'm just like my country, I'm young, scrappy and hungry
And I'm not throwin' away my shot
I said I'm not throwin' away my shot
No, I'm not throwin' away my shot
Yo, I'm just like my country, I'm young, scrappy and hungry
And I'm not throwin' away my shot

When opportunity knock, you don't send anyone to get it
Answer the door, welcome it, let it in or regret it
They said if you can't beat 'em you join 'em
I said, ""Forget it""
'Cause once you join 'em you're buildin' a ceilin' the way you're headed
Be American, express how you feel and take the credit
Don't settle for 87, go premium unleaded and
Take off, shake all the hate off, it's over
It's they loss, the payoff's their weight off your shoulders
Must admit, I'm feelin', I'm kind of um
Lighter as a writer with this fire and desire to go higher
Than a stealth fighter pilot with my eye on every prize
I surprise you guys, I'm a prize fighter
My nine to five describe, your scribe survive minor
Setbacks and take steps back from pied pipers
Be leaders, believers in yourself and mean it
I mean you only get one shot, take it or leave it

I said I'm not throwin' away my shot
I said I'm not throwin' away my shot

Rise up
If you livin' on your knees, you rise up
Tell your brother that he's gotta rise up
Tell your sister that she's gotta rise up
When are folks like me and you gonna rise up?
Every city, every hood, we need to rise up
All my soldiers, what's good? We need to rise up
We ain't got no other choice, we need to rise up
Rise up!

Throughout my travels and journeys through life I've been searchin'
And been learnin' to be the type of person to display how determined I get
When I'm certain, inside I feel that fire that's burnin'
Like a knife that is turnin', I fight while I'm hurtin'
Sometimes they're right 'cause life is a burden
Like the pain from a bite that'll worsen
Tryna stifle the light that'll shine on me first and
Before I ride in a hearse and
My breathing stops and you'll never take my one shot I got 'fore I lie in the earth
And now I kill again on that Hamilton Hercules Mulligan
Readin' in Vanity Fair or the Huffington
Done with the sufferin', we in the guts again, family rushin' in
Wonder where Busta been, feelin' the hunger and feedin' the lust to win
See I've been patiently waitin' for this moment
To rise up again, that's the way I was molded
And as the last one standin' as the rest of them foldin'
Give me my one chance to grab the torch and properly hold it

I said I'm not throwin' away my shot
I said I'm not throwin' away my shot
Ayy, yo I'm just like my country, I'm young, scrappy and hungry
And I'm not throwin' away my shot

The Time has come for the blood to run into the streets paved with gold 
We have lived in the zoo of the ghetto for so long 
And like animals we kill each other for the hatred of others 
We must move into the suburbs and punish the rich for their ignorance 
For the horror of death  that is part of our life in our neighborhood 
And give them a taste of the same 
And when we kill the governments children 
And the streets smell of death 
Maybe then we will see our situation in a new light 
And put an end the the chaos in the ghetto and an end to the killings 

[Violent J]
Heard what's going on in the free world 
Broke out the asylum and killed a girl 
Just to warm you, just to get it on 
'Cause I'm gonna be cutting throats till the break of dawn 
Can't nobody get me 
I've always been a psycho now they coming with me 
That's straight when we team up 
'Cause I believe every throat deserves a good cut 
Look in my brain its fucking insane 
Roll around naked in the acid rain 
Rich bitch fucka took me for a sucka 
Now we killing you instead of killing each other 
Walked in the house, shot him in the mouth 
Leaned back the head, and pulled the brains out 
My list are strong its only a saw 
The government fronts like they don't know what is going on 
Fuck, I'll take the matter in my own hands 
Cut ya down cat, cut ya down 
'Cause I know the rich go jogging 
And I'm waiting in the bushes, axe to the noggin
About thirty or forty times, 
Psychodelic sick with the psycho psycho rhymes 
But ya keep the killer in one place, 
But I'm at ya door, motherfucker have a taste!

Begging for money, acting like he know ya 
Ya slam the door in fear, but some day he'll show ya 
Catch ya at point blank range ya getting jacked

Happens everyday, one another the other 
But the suburb living is high class 
With a high class leather city trade with ya ass 
And show ya the rough times 
Hungry homeless people committing crime after crime 
And bitches working the pike for dough 
Then they run to the rock sella to buy some rocks slow 
And I hear ya making fun of that...

Ich trinke ein Martini an der Bar,
Mit den Piraten, ist meine Familie
Wir sind in irgendeiner Stadt gestrandet, wo wir nie waren
Verlorene Seelen die sich zusammentrommeln um Parra zu kriegen
Lass dich nicht täuschen die Oase bleibt 'ne Fata Morgana
Wie die Schlangen die dich in den Irrweg führen wollen, sei immer wachsam
Schwimmen in feindlichen Gewässer, trage mein Messer
Auf der Jagd nach Gold mit der Hoffnung danach wird alles besser
Ich sah viele Leute die scheiterten dran
Kein Caravan, alleine durchs Land 50 Grad,
Bis ihr verstand sie verlässt, fast wie bei ner Geisterstadt
Die Menschen konnten nicht lern', wollten immer mehr
Durchsuch' nochmal alle Schränke gründlich denn die Konten sind schon leer
Kleine Rast, aber dann weiter lass nicht Zeit verliern' vor Sonnenuntergang
Müssen wir zum geheimen Platz und uns den Schatz einkassiern'
Digga bleib lieber hier denn ich hab die Karte
Wir folgen schon lange dem Weg auf der Straße
Die Schrift ist verschlüsselt,
Viele fielen im Fall weil sie keiner vorwarnte

Alles dreht sich, ich krieg ein Hitzeschlag, Fata Morgana
Halluzination und der Wüstensand bringen mich vom Pfad ab
Kreuzt du unsern Weg wird dein Schiff gekapert
Land in Sicht, dürfen nicht aufgeben sind schon nah dran

Alles dreht sich, ich krieg ein Hitzeschlag, Fata Morgana

Kreuzt du unsern Weg wird dein Schiff gekapert

Wir ziehen durch das Land von Stand- zu Standort
Sei immer gut gewadmet denn hier endet es schnell in nem' Sandsturm
Lass unnötige Last zurück, sonst werden wir nicht vorankommen
Folge ihr nicht diese Frau ist ein Phantom,
Geb ich dir mit als ne Warnung
Viele merken zu spät die Verwandlung
Werden Handlungsunfähig und
Enden wie bei Medusa versteinert im Käfig
Alle Gefährten ham's versuchst doch sie ließen sich verleiten
Von der Schönheit und von Versprechen die sie nie halten
Dürre Zeiten, seh ein Kaktus da am Horizont,
Grün, ein gutes Omen sind durstig wollen raus aus dem trockenen komm'
Sei vorsichtig denn das alles kann nur Illusion sein
Besessen, hat nur einmal was von der falschen Frucht gegessen, sein Urteil
Hier war's mal voller Leben doch die Seelen sind verdunstet
Zeugen unzählige Fossilien und Muscheln, verschwundener Dschungel

Nate57,"Kickdown Richtung Festival
Mit sechs black Benzers und dem besten Gin
Red Ice, Sonnenbrille auf wie Edgar Davids
Ain't nothin' but a gangster party
Alle Fans wollen mich fressen, ja, sie lieben den Scheiß
Doch ich bleibe immer cool wie mein Jim Beam auf Eis
Stagetime, jetzt wird abgerissen
Dabei bin ich Unternehmer, so wie Russell Simmons
Mister Dardy ballert bös in das Mic
Ich wurde erschaffen für den größeren Scheiß
Und das ist nicht irgendein Rhyme
Ich zerfick' euer Hype, denn der Mörder ist frei
Und Bitches versuchen mir mein Herz zu erobern
Doch ich kann nur lächeln wie Joker
Diese Flows befördern dich zum Notarzt
Diese Rapper kriegen Eier wie an Ostern
Doch ihr macht nur Show wie WWE
Meine Flows haben 'ne eigene Kategorie
Dieses Geschäft ist einfache Mathematik
Wenn du nix hast, musst du einfach die Patte abziehen
Digga, wir hängen in der Gutter
Und wir zeigen diesen ganzen Motherfuckern, dieser Flow hier ist richtig crazy
Darf ich vorstellen, wir sind Piraten und nicht die Navy
We run the world wie die Bitch von Jay-Z

Egal, ob Karoviertel oder Stuttgarter Loch

Komm' aus der Stadt, die nie schläft, hier ist immer hell
Mach dich lieber unsichtbar wie Splinter Cell (pew, pew)
Jeden Tag fließt Para hier ins Kartell (grrr)
Alle businessorientiert, Springer Welt
Zähl' das Geld, Hehlerware straight aus Garage
Von Antikvase bis Aufladkarte (ey)
Spezialisten für Demontage
Heute steht dick mein Name da auf Reklame, denn (yeah)
Wir sind wieder mal auf Tour
Es geht von Stadt zu Stadt, es fühlt sich an wie Kur
Nie mehr vor den Bullen Schanzenparkour
Es dreht sich um Mucke, das rund um die Uhr (rund um Uhr)
Unser Flow ist ungestreckt und pur
Mucke aus dem Bauch findest du selten nur (selten nur)
Techniques wie Piraten, bleiben stramm wie das Seil
Und zerreißen euch leicht wie 'ne Schnur
Es fließt runter wie die Niagara Fälle (Fälle)
Die meisten Rappern klingen live wie 'ne Henne (ärhh)
Weggeschwitzt, man dreht durch auf alle Fälle
Sind nicht nur für Schurub die Quelle (yeah)
Hoes wollen saugen, kriegen Yarak nicht mehr
Brich ganz schnell den Kontakt ab
Hab' keine Zeit für Groupies, auf Jagd nach Hunnis
Mach' viel lieber Features mit Dardan

Natepoetics,"She knew exactly who I was becoming
Reality of dreams, younger for memories of a still wonder
Of who I might be
And for her it’s hard to stomach what’s left behind
And what’s to come in the same introduction of a king
Just know everything coming can only give birth to the principle that by any means
I produce like eagles
Soar in the highest clouds to let my conscience free
So I can feed ex girls like sea gulls with better egos in out work
While these ambitions girl with the tip of my penis
To write stories, a young boy the genius
And I mean this, there’s never been a day off
Never been laid off, my own boss and my payoff is to get laid off
Get a break off just to rehire myself
For the take off
A Beach House, the EP

Ey, these hoes all tryna come back and make it work, make it work
I tell these hoes come get this work, get this work
I give no fucks, I give no damn, give no damn
I took my bitch straight from her man, from her man
That nigga ain’t had much money as I do
That nigga don’t know yo' body like I do
Yo friends think I ain’t shit, I don’t like 'em either
Them hoes ain’t shit, they can’t keep no man either
Ain’t believing me then but you see me now
Said you’d never trust me again but you believe me now
And now somehow we supposed to fix ya, 'pposed to fix ya

Baby girl she 100, my mind right, that’s real stuntin'
She in the crowd tryna flock for me
I fucked around and then went for it
I love that girl so much
I fucked around and paid the rent for her
Feel like I’m the right pimp for her
But we got enough, she ain’t gotta work
I give it to er, I got it first
She right here, I ain’t gotta search
We in a party (We in a party, we in a party, we in a party)
We in a party, I’m amused by how you move yo' body (Move yo body)
Baby girl she more poppin' in the 12 gauge Shawty
She off four shots, we goin' up, I don’t need no molly
These hoes fuck with the squad, she ran through the whole posy
Girl I think about you when I’m in that hotel lobby (Hotel lobby)
I’m coming home to you, yea I got work for yo' body (Yo' body)

Hoes, I used to have a lot of kind
But when they realize that I gotta grind
I replaced the lies and the thighs and the hotter dimes
With the fuckin' rhymes and the ties and the dolla signs
The symbol of the conducers off of what my mental produces
I’m leaving these haters clueless
When I spit because they missin' what I get because I’m cold
Real niggas listen to the shit that I unfold
I cannot believe the way they used to be lovin' these hoes
Now that I be on my money, it’s funny the way that I govern these hoes
And I be runnin' these hoes, doin' whatever I wanna do with em
As long as I be on my pimpin',
'Cause I’m gon' let nothing in front of me after my currency flow
And if we getting the fetty so up
So why would I throw it away for the bitches
That won’t give a fuck about me in position to fall and be nothing
I’m done wit' yo' frontin', just give me yo dollars, I don’t wanna holler
I don’t want yo' woman, I want the Impala
To seek for the Benjamins I am a shotta
And Twista love dollars but I admit

But now I love this money
I used to love these hoes

I used to love these hoes
But now I love this money

Nathalie,"Erano pezzi di vetro
Sparsi sul nostro cammino
Le nostre difese
Lasciate sospese

Fluida acqua che scorre
I nodi miei già si sciolgono
Come neve d'estate
Ma ti guardo tornare su letti di spine
Le nostre parole lontane dal cuore
Le nostre paure immotivate, congelate

L'amore con te è come camminare
In punta di piedi senza potersi fermare

Ma sento il tuo calore forte
Negli angoli bui delle mie stanze gelate
Appesa al tuo respiro mi vedo cadere
Per poi ritornare a sentirmi felice

Ma la tensione che sento verso il tuo respiro
Mi distoglie dal pensiero
Di tutto ciò che abbiamo perso
E credo a volte di volere riparare
Di poter ricostruire
Tutto nuovo e un po' diverso

Ma sento il tuo calore forte
Negli angoli bui delle mie stanze gelate
Appesa al tuo respiro mi vedo cadere
Per poi ritornare a sentirmi felice
Mi fermo di fronte al tuo viso

Di poterti affidare
Di poterti fidare
Di me
Puoi fidarti di me",In Punta Di Piedi,2010

Came crazy bobby runnin' naked as a bird
Naked as a baby on his birthing hour
With his butt on the vinyl and all that horsepower

[Chorus]
And all you could see was a big ball of dust
And old number 6, big money or bust
Everybody wondered what he had under the hood
The day crazy bobby ran the dirt track in the nude

All the old men and all the old women said he ruined the trip
If they'd wanted burned rubber and rubber burning they'd have gone to the drag strip
An old boy said he's taking quite a chance
Going hard into the corner and wearing no pants
Sister she cried and grandma she screamed

My fighting days are over
My fighting days it's true
My fighting days are over
My fighting days are through

There were six of them there was one of me
I said what kind of man do you think I'll be
After twelve weeks in bed on a clear iv
I figured they had gotten the best of me

I loved the wife of a jealous man
She said she'd tell him and he'd understand
He understood so well he brought a knife and a gun
Said after I shoot you I'll skin ya for fun

I'm a lucky man I'd have to admit
When there's trouble sitting there I've stepped in it
Now I walk real quiet and I smile real wide

Nathan Berg,"A country dance was being held in a garden
I felt a bump and heard an ""Oh, beg your pardon""
Suddenly I saw polka dots and moonbeams
All around a pug-nosed dream

The music started and was I the perplexed one
I held my breath and said ""May I have the next one?""
In my frightened arms, polka dots and moonbeams
Sparkled on a pug-nosed dream

There were questions in the eyes of other dancers
As we floated over the floor
There were questions but my heart knew all the answers
And perhaps a few things more

Now in a cottage built of lilacs and laughter
I know the meaning of the words ""Ever after""
And I'll always see polka dots and moonbeams
When I kiss the pug-nosed dream",Polka Dots and Moonbeams,1990

Teach them well and let them lead the way
Show them all the beauty they possess inside
Give them a sense of pride, to make it easier
Let the children's laughter remind us how we use to be

Everybody's searching for a hero
People need someone to look up to
I never found anyone who fulfilled my needs
A lonely place to be, and so I learned to depend on me
 
I decided long ago never to walk in anyone's shadow
If I fail, if I succeed 
At least I lived as I believe 
No matter what they take from me
They can't take away my dignity
 
Because the greatest love of all is happening to me
I found the greatest love of all inside of me
The greatest love of all is easy to achieve
Learning to love yourself, it is the greatest love of all

Why won't he be the king I know he is?

And had everything I'd ever dreamed of
I suddenly realized that this man, this man

No one every made me feel like someone
'Til him
Life was really nothing but a glum one
'Til him
My existence bordered on the tragic
Always timid, never took a chance
Then I felt his magic and my heart began to dance

I was always frightened, fraught with worry
'Til him
I was going nowhere in a hurry
'Til him
He filled up my empty life, filled it to the brim
There could never ever be another one like him

Leo, I, I never realized you're a good singer
Thank you, Max I sang it for you
I sang it because I'm your friend

You are? Gee, I've had a lot of relationships
But you couldn't call any of them friend
But come to think of it

No one ever ever really knew me
'Til him
Everyone was always out to screw me
'Til him
Never met a man I ever trusted
Always dealt with shysters in the past
Now I'm well adjusted 'cause I've got a friend at last

Don't help me

Always playing singles, never doubles
'Til him
Never had a pal to share my troubles
'Til him
He filled up my empty life, filled it to the brim
There could never ever be another one like him

Glorious Bloom, it's so simple
Step one, we find the worst play ever written
Step two, we hire the worst director in town
Step three, I raise two million dollars

Two? Yes, one for me, one for you
There's a lot of little old ladies out there
Step four, we hire the worst actors in New York
And open on Broadway and before you can say, “Step five”
We close on Broadway, take our two million and go to Rio

Rio? Nah, that'd never work, oh, ye of little faith

What did Sir Edmund say to Tenzing

I mean you, sir, go beserk

Here's what I say to you, sir

I can't do it, I can't do it
I can't do it, that's not me
I'm a loser, I'm a coward
I'm a chicken, don't you see?

When it comes to wooing women
There's a few things that I lack
Beautiful girls, wearing nothing but pearls
Cashing me, embracing me, I'd have an attack

Why, you miserable, cowardly, wretched little caterpillar
Don't you ever want to become a butterfly?
Don't you want to spread your wings
And flap your way to glory?

I'm not as strong a person as you think
Mr. Bialystock, just take a look
I'm not a crook, I'm just a shnook

How could this happen?
The show was lousy and long, we did everything wrong
Where did we go right?
Christmas came early to Broadway this year
And guess who they stuffed in our stocking? Adolf Hitler!
It was so crass and so crude even Goebbels would've booed
Where did we go right?

Last night a star was born on Broadway the lovely Miss Ulla
Inga Hansen Bensen Yonsen Tallen-Hallen Svaden-Svanson
We predict that her name will soon be up in lights
If they can find enough bulbs

We searched Broadway on and off
For singers with a cough
We had tryouts and auditions by the score
And to trip the light fantastic
We picked dancers who were spastic
If anyone jetted, we jetted them out the door

They shouted hooray for that sausage on display
Where did we go right?
Our leading man was so gay he nearly flew away
Where did we go right?
A show so easy to despise
Now it's up for the Pulitzer prize
Oh, where, oh, where, tell us
Where did we go right?

The best new music of the decade!
Max Bialystock is a theatrical genius!
Now they like me

Oh, we knew we couldn't lose
Half the audience were Jews
It's the end of our careers
It'll run for twenty years

And live at a new altitude.
I'm gonna reach for the stars to remind me,
That meerkats are not merely food!

For once I'll be,
Looking out for me.

I'll tell you what I want,
This cat is moving on.
Where he's a bonlibonte,
Who's missing out on the bone.
I'd be a bigger cheese,
Far from the desert scenes.
A little booling breeze.
A little patch of green.

And I'll be sitting in my hammock,
By a rippling stream.
Many miles from any tunnels,
Or the digging team.
Looking out for number one,
Will be my only greed.
That's all I need,
That's all I need!

I've always been good at running away,
But now I'm gonna run to show.

But now my status ain't so quo.

Through the darkness and the shadows

Nathan Stanley,"One fine day as I was a-walkin' down the street
Spied a beggar man with rags upon his feet
Took a penny from my pocket
In his tin cup I did drop it
I heard him say as I made my retreat

[Chorus:]
May the bird of paradise fly up your nose
May an elephant caress you with his toes
May your wife be plagued with runners in her hose
May the bird of paradise fly up your nose

The laundry man is really on his toes
Found a hundred-dollar bill among my clothes
When he called me I came a-runnin'
Gave him back his dime for phonin'
I heard him sayin' as I turned to go

[Chorus]

I was way behind one day to catch the train
Taxi driver said ""We'll make it just the same""
The speed cop made it with us
And as he wrote out the ticket
I stood by politely a-waitin' for my change

I was lost in a world of strangers
No one to trust
On my own, I was lonely
You suddenly appeared
It was cloudy before but now it's clear
You took away the fear
You brought me back to life

You are the sun
You make me shine
Or more like the stars
That twinkle at night
You are the moon
That glows in my heart
You're my daytime my nighttime
My world
You're my life

Now I wake up everyday
With this smile upon my face
No more tears, no more pain
'Cause you love me
You help me understand
That love is the answer to all that I am
And I'm a better man

First of all because
He quite often is not all that happy and sexual satisfied at home
His wife won't perform all the activities he has in mind
And most of all, oral sex is a taboo
The woman would say 'what do you think I am, a whore

My wife oh my wife is she dead in bed
She's frigid, cold as a starfish

He dives into the bedroom
He says ""Do me!"", suck it !

Nathaniel Parker,"I believe that children are our future;
Teach them well and let them lead the way.
Show them all the beauty they possess inside.
Give them a sense of pride, to make it easier;
Let the children's laughter remind us how we use to be.
 
Everybody's searching for a hero;
People need someone to look up to.
I never found anyone who fulfilled my need.
A lonely place to be, and so I learned to depend on me.
 
I decided long ago never to walk in anyone's shadow.
If I fail, if I succeed. 
At least I lived as I believe. 
No matter what they take from me,
They can't take away my dignity.
 
Because the greatest love of all is happening to me.
I found the greatest love of all inside of me.
The greatest love of all is easy to achieve.
Learning to love yourself is the greatest love of all.

Were you up all night afraid of what the future might bring?
I feel fine today
I've had dreams of you in places I've not seen before
You get so carried away
Like lovers new to bodies first to touch you here
This ain't a getaway
You built walls around your heart to try to lock it in

I'm gonna leave it all out there to dry
I'm gonna leave it all out there
I'm gonna leave it all out there to dry up
I'm gonna leave it all out there

And upon the wind it's carried
Over the cities and the plains
You got time you're on the mend babe
And everybody wants the same
Everybody wants the same thing

What I've done, 
Found a word,

But if you'll do 
What you're told, 
You'll find the answer if you take a look

I call my baby my sugar, 
That is the reason why, maybe, 
That sugar baby is mine! 
I'm shoutin' 'bout him, 
Funny, he doesn't spend any money, 
All he can lend me is honey, 
That he can send anytime! 
I'd make a million trips 
To his lips, 
If I were a bee, 
'Cause they are sweeter 
Than any candy to me! 
That's why I'm sighin';

I get my taffy from sugar! 
What's more, I'm daffy 'bout sugar, 
That sugar baby of mine! 
My sugar's so refined, 
You can't find 
None like him in town; 
To make it more complete 
He's so sweet and so brown, 
He's special ration,

Knows I'm just sweet on my sugar, 
No, I won't cheat on my sugar,

Nathaniel Street-West,"I pounded on a farmhouse 
Lookin' for a place to stay. 
I was mighty, mighty tired, 
I had gone a long, long way. 
I said, ""Hey, hey, in there, 
Is there anybody home?"" 
I was standin' on the steps 
Feelin' most alone. 
Well, out comes a farmer, 
He must have thought that I was nuts. 
He immediately looked at me 
And stuck a gun into my guts. 

I fell down 
To my bended knees, 
Saying, ""I dig farmers, 
Don't shoot me, please!"" 
He cocked his rifle 
And began to shout, 
""You're that travelin' salesman 
That I have heard about."" 
I said, ""No! No! No! 
I'm a doctor and it's true, 
I'm a clean-cut kid 
And I been to college, too."" 

Then in comes his daughter 
Whose name was Rita.
She looked like she stepped out of 
La Dolce Vita. 
I immediately tried to cool it 
With her dad, 
And told him what a 
Nice, pretty farm he had. 
He said, ""What do doctors 
Know about farms, pray tell?"" 
I said, ""I was born 
At the bottom of a wishing well

Well, by the dirt 'neath my nails 
I guess he knew I wouldn't lie. 
""I guess you're tired,"" 
He said, kinda sly. 
I said, ""Yes, ten thousand miles 
Today I drove."" 
He said, ""I got a bed for you 
Underneath the stove.
Just one condition 
And you go to sleep right now, 
That you don't touch my daughter 
And in the morning, milk the cow."" 

I was sleepin' like a rat 
When I heard something jerkin'.
There stood Rita 
Lookin' just like Tony Perkins. 
She said, ""Would you like to take a shower? 
I'll show you up to the door."" 
I said, ""Oh, no! no! 
I've been through this before."" 
I knew I had to split 
But I didn't know how, 
When she said, 
""Would you like to take that shower, now?"" 

Well, I couldn't leave 
Unless the old man chased me out, 
'Cause I'd already promised 
That I'd milk his cows.
I had to say something 
To strike him very weird, 
So I yelled out, 
""I like Fidel Castro and his beard."" 
Rita looked offended 
But she got out of the way, 
As he came charging down the stairs 
Sayin', ""What's that I heard you say?"" 

I said, ""I like Fidel Castro, 
I think you heard me right,"" 
And ducked as he swung 
At me with all his might.
Rita mumbled something 
'Bout her mother on the hill, 
As his fist hit the icebox, 
He said he's going to kill me 
If I don't get out the door 
In two seconds flat, 
""You unpatriotic, 
Rotten doctor Commie rat."" 

Well, he threw a Reader's Digest 
At my head and I did run, 
I did a somersault 
As I seen him get his gun 
And crashed through the window 
At a hundred miles an hour, 
And landed fully blast 
In his garden flowers.
Rita said, ""Come back!"" 
As he started to load 
The sun was comin' up 
And I was runnin' down the road. 

Well, I don't figure I'll be back 
There for a spell, 
Even though Rita moved away 
And got a job in a motel. 
He still waits for me,

Like a good muffled kick drum… ah! Music

That’s one of the reasons why
Why the city alive does there lie in lye

“Don’t lie to me”
Say’s the dirty scoundrel who aches all day
Taking away my thoughts to be placed in abstract morality based,
Dry with clink stains, 
Dry
Dry as a bone, how mutely solemn it is to grow up there

The only thing bringing water
Being your flaming tongue, with words of existentialism
“Here try this”
“What is it, peyote?”
“It is indeed,” says the coyote”

“Ah! Everything now much, much more dryer”
Oh no that won’t do,
And away I walk
Like a battered angel (aren’t we all)
Escaping from the war

Now I’m out alone in the moonlit night
Again seeing the city…
Alive I tell ya!
It ain’t so groovy though, when you’re in it
Drowning in the selfish day
Ah again! Away!
Eagle bearing sorrows but I think
“So! It’s a beautiful bird. Take me away oh fare hawk.”

Now lying in a gutter beside an outskirt road
High stalks of weed’s all around
To my left out of the gutter,
High straws and above a starless night…
Why? Because to my right across the highway
Across more weeds and stalks of brown floral,
An airport in its selfless mutiny
(Bright lights lighting up, oh i’d say at about)
200 yards away the whole of it infamously stands
(Rather than wonder who I am or where I am)
Like all occurrences during night and day
I travel on foot, leave my car parked behind me
Seems as i’d taken a nap,
Although you can’t really be sure in a place like this
“Where am i”? I say
Then, looking at my shoes, say “just kidding,” and walk on
Crossing the highway
For now completely absorbed in the moment

It seems like i’ve had this dream before
But don’t it always
Walking now through lugubrious fields of brown tall grass
And gravel,
I come to the concrete runway
Clouds, many clouds, must be the reason for no stars…i think.
So I get back to my car in what seemed like a shudder of a millionth,
(Billionth of a second)
(Tick-clocking, tick-tocking it’s way closer to a second)

And what it calls an infinity
Really being less than a minute…
Much like us waiting for death
“Death in time my son”
The grandfather clock groans

Look outside…

Nathaniel Walcott,"Does he kiss your eyelids in the morning when you start to raise your head?
And does he sing to you incessantly from the space between your bed and wall?
Does he walk around all day at school with his feet inside your shoes?
Looking down every few steps to pretend he walks with you.
Does he know that place below your neck that is your favorite to be touched
And does he cry through broken sentences like I love you far too much?
Does he lay awake listening to your breath?
Worried that you smoke too many cigarettes.
Is he coughing now on a bathroom floor?
For every speck of tile there are a thousand more
That you won't ever see but most hold inside yourself eternally.

I drug your ghost across the country and we plotted out my death.
In every city, memories would whisper: ""Here is where you rest.""
I was determined in Chicago but I dug my teeth into my knees
And I settled for a telephone and sang into your machine.

You are my sunshine, my only sunshine
You are my sunshine, my only sunshine

I kissed a girl with a broken jaw that her father gave to her.
She had eyes bright enough to burn me. They reminded me of yours.
In a story told she was a little girl in a red-rouge,
Sun-bruised field and there were rows of ripe tomatoes where a secret was concealed.
And it rose like thunder, clapped under our hands.
And it stretched for centuries to a diary entry's end where I wrote,

You make me happy whoa!  When the skies are gray
You make me happy whoa!  The skies are gray and gray and gray.

Well the clock's heart it hangs inside its open chest with its hands

If I am dead, as dead I will may be
You'll come and find the place where I am lying
And 'neel and say an 'Ave' for me

And I shall hear those soft you tread above me
And all my grave will warm and sweeter be
If you will built and tell me that you love me
Then I shall sleep in peace until you come to me","Londonderry Air (Danny Boy), folk song",1989

And a rose that is fading
Roses whither away like the sunflower
I yearn to turn my face to the dawn
I am waiting for the day

Midnight, not a sound from the pavement
Has the moon lost her memory?
She is smiling alone in the lamplight
The withered leaves collect at my feet
And the wind begins to moan

Memory, all alone in the moonlight
I can smile at the old days, I was beautiful then
I remember the time I knew what happiness was
Let the memory live again

Every street lamp
Seems to beat a fatalistic warning
Someone mutters and the street lamp gutters
And soon it will be morning

Daylight, I must wait for the sunrise
I must think of a new life
And I mustn't give in when the dawn comes
Tonight will be a memory too
And a new day will begin

Burnt out ends of smoky days
The stale cold smell of morning
The street lamp dies, another night is over
Another day is dawning

Touch me, it's so easy to leave me
All alone with the memory
Of my days in the sun if you touch me
You'll understand what happiness is

Look
A new day has begun",Memory [From Cats],1996

(There can be no doubt about that.) Please listen to me and don't scoff. 
All his inventions are off his own bat. there's no such cat in the Metropolis: 
He holds all the patent monopolies, 
For performing surprising illusions and creating eccentric confusions.

The greatest magicians have something to learn
From Mister Mistoffelees Conjuring Turn.
And you'll all say: 
Oh! well I never was there ever a cat so clever as Magical Mister Mistoffelees.

He is quiet he is small he is black,
From his ears to the tip of his tail.
He can creep through the tiniest crack, 
He can walk on the narrowest rail.

He can pick any card from a pack,
He is equally cunning with dice.
He is always deceiving you into believing that he's only hunting for mice.
He can play any trick with a cork,

Or a spoon and a bit of fish paste.
If you look for a knife or a fork
And you think it is merely misplaced;
You have seen it one moment and then it is gone,
But you find it next week lying out on the lawn.

[Chorus: x2]
And we all say: Oh! 
Well I never was there ever a cat so clever as Magical Mister Mistoffelees.

My manner is vague and aloof,
You would think there is nobody shyer,
But my voice has been heard on the roof
When I was curled up by the fire,

And I've sometimes been heard by the fire;
When I was around on the roof
(At least they all heard that somebody purred)
Which is incontestable proof

Of my singular magical powers,
And I've known the family to call
Me in the garden for hours
While I was asleep in the hall.

And not long ago this phenomenal cat
Produced seven kittens right out of a hat!

My one companion
You were all
That mattered
You were once
A friend and father
Then my world
Was shattered

Wishing you were
Somehow here again
Wishing you were
Somehow near
Sometimes it seemed
If I just dreamed,
Somehow you would
Be here

Wishing I could
Hear your voice again
Knowing that I
Never would
Dreaming of you
Won't help me to do
All that you dreamed
I could

Passing bells
And sculpted angels,
Cold and monumental,
Seem, for you,
The wrong companions
You were warm and gentle

Too many years
Fighting back tears
Why can't the past
Just die?

Wishing you were
Somehow here again
Knowing we must
Say goodbye
Try to forgive
Teach me to live
Give me the strength
To try

No more silent tears
No more gazing across
The wasted years
Help me say

Silent...

I have brought you,

May fuse and merge -

Succumbed to me,
Dropped all defences,
Completely succumbed to me -

Descend...

Unlocks its door?

How long should we
Two wait, before
We're one...?

Begin to race,

Burst into bloom?

A rich beautiful thing of all the talents, a cross between 
A fantasy of the bedroom and a saint 
You were just a back street girl 
Hustling and fighting 
Scratching and biting 
High flying, adored, did you believe in your wildest moments 
All this would be yours, that you'd become the lady of them all? 
Were there stars in your eyes when you crawled in at night 
From the bars, from the sidewalks
From the gutter theatrical? 
Don't look down, it's a long, long way to fall
High flying, adored, what happens now, where do you go from here? 
For someone on top of the world, the view is not exactly clear 
A shame you did it all at twenty-six
There are no mysteries now 
Nothing can thrill you 
No-one fulfill you 
High flying, adored, I hope you come to terms with boredom 
So famous, so easily, so soon, is not the wisest thing to be
You won't care if they love you, it's been done before 
You'll despair if they hate you 
You'll be drained of all energy 
All the young who've made it would agree

In olden days, a glimpse of stocking

Now only use four-letter words

If low bars you like, 
If old hymns you like, 
If bare limbs you like, 
If Mae West you like, 
Or me undressed you like,

When ev'ry night the set that's smart is in- 
Truding in nudist parties in 
Studios. 
Anything goes. 

When Missus Ned McLean (God bless her) 
Can get Russian reds to ""yes"" her, 
Then I suppose 
Anything goes. 
When Rockefeller still can hoard en- 
Ough money to let Max Gordon 
Produce his shows,

And black's white today,

Find out Vanderbilts and Whitneys

Instruct Anna Sten in diction,

On her toes,

On September twelfth right here
In front of the Waverly
But unfortunately I lost his address
He was last seen with his friend, a drummer
He resembles George Harrison of The Beatles
But he wears his hair tied in a small bow at the back
I love him but it embarrasses me
To walk down the street with him
He lives in Brooklyn somewhere
And he wears his white crash helmet
He has golden chains on his leather jacket
And on the back are written the names
""Mary"" and ""Mom"" and ""Hell's Angels""

Tell him Angela and I don't want the two dollars back just him",April Showers [From Hair],2002

Where is it written
What is it I was meant to be?
That I can't dare

That from my window I could only see

I never dreamed it was so wide

If you've never flown at all

Sometimes where danger lies
There the sweetest of pleasures are found
No matter where I go
There'll be memories that tug at my sleeve
But there will also be
More to question, yet more to believe
Oh tell me where?
Where is the someone who will turn and look at me?
And want to share
My every sweet-imagined possibility?
The more I live - the more I learn
The more I learn - the more I realize
The less I know
Each step I take 
(Papa, I've a voice now!)
Each page I turn 
(Papa, I've a choice now!)

The more I have to go
What's wrong with wanting more?

With all there is - why settle for

It's Illmatic",The Genesis,2018
National Symphony Orchestra,"Check me out y'all, Nasty Nas in your area
About to cause mass hysteria

Before a blunt, I take out my fronts
Then I start to front, matter of fact, I be on a manhunt
You couldn't catch me in the streets without a ton of reefer
That's like Malcolm X catching the Jungle Fever
King poetic, too much flavor, I'm major
Atlanta and braver, I pull a number like a pager
Cause I'm am ace when I face the bass
40 side is the place that is giving me grace
Now wait, another dose and you might be dead
And I'm a Nike head, I wear chains that excite the feds
And ain't' a damn thing gonna change
I'm a perform a strange show the mic wonder was born the game?
Nas, why did you do it
You know you got the mad fat fluid when you rhyme, it's halftime

It's halftime

It's like that, you know it's like that
I got at him, now you never get the mic back
When I attack, there ain't an army that could strike back
So I react never calmly on a hype track
I set it off wit my own rhyme
Cause I'm as ill as a convict who kills for phone time
I'm max like cassettes, I flex like sex
In your stereo sets, Nas will catch wreck
I used to hustle, now all I do is relax and strive
When I was young, I was a fan of the Jackson 5
I drop jewels, wear jewels to never run it
Wit more kicks than a baby in a mother's stomach
Nasty Nas has to rise, kid, surprise
This is exercise til the microphone dies
Back in '83, I was an MC sparking
But I was too scared to grab the mic's in the park and
Kick my little raps 'cause I thought niggas wouldn't understand
And now in every jam I'm the fucking man
I rap in front of more niggas than in the slave ships
I used to watch C.H.I.P.S, now I load glock clips
I got to have it, I miss Mr Magic
Versatile, my style switches like a fagot
But not a bisexual, I'm an intellectual
Of rap, I'm a professional and that's no question, yo
These are the lyrics of the man, you can't near it, understand
'cause in the streets, I'm well known like the number man
In my place wit the bass and format
Explore rap and tell me Nas ain't all that
And next time I rhyme, I be fouled whenever I freestyle
I see trial niggas say I'm wow
I hate a rhyme biter's rhyme
Stay tuned, Nas, soon the real rap comes at halftime

It's halftime

I got it going on, even flip 'em on this song
Every afternoon, I kick half the tune
And in the darkness, I'm heartless like when the narcs hit
Word to Marcus Garvey or heartless Sparkton
'cause when I blast the herb, that's my word
I be slaying them fast, doing this, that in the third
But chill, past the entree and let's lay
I bag bitches up at John Jay and hit a matinee
Putting hits on 5-0
Cause when it's my time to go, I wait for God wit the fo-fo
And biters can't come near
And yo, go to hell to the foul cop who shot Garcia
I won't plant seeds, don't need an extra mouth I can't feed
That's extra Phillie change, more cash for that weed
This goes out to Manhattan, the island of Staten
Brooklyn, Queens is living fat and
The Boogie Down, enough props, enough clout
I'll will, rest in peace, yo, I'm out

National Symphony Orchestra,"The mic check is life or death, breathing a sniper's breath
I exhale the yellow smoke of buddha through righteous steps
Deep like The Shinin', sparkle like a diamond
Sneak a uzi on the island in my army jacket lining
Hit the Earth like a comet, invasion
Nas is like the Afrocentric Asian, half-man, half-amazing
And my physical, I'll express through song
Delete stress like Motrin, then extend strong
I drank Moet with Medusa, give her shotguns in hell
From the spliff that I lift and inhale, it ain't hard to tell

The buddha monk's in your trunk, turn the bass up
Nas, stories by Aesop, place your loot up

Inhale from the L, school a fool well, you feel it like braille

Plus 'Matic, I freak beats slam it like Iron Shiek
Jam like a tech with correct techniques
They analyze me, surprise me, but can't magnetize me
Scanning while you're planning ways to sabotage me
I leave 'em froze like heroin in your nose
Nas'll rock well, it ain't hard to tell

This rhythmatic explosion, is what your frame of mind has chosen
I'll leave your brain stimulated, niggas is frozen
Speak with criminal slang, begin like a violin
End like Leviathan, it's deep well let me try again
Wisdom be leaking out my grapefruit troop
I dominate break loops, giving mics men-e-straul cycles
Street's disciple, I rock beats that's mega trifle
And groovy but smoother than moves by Villanova
Yet still a soldier, I'm like Sly Stallone in Cobra
Packing like a rasta in the weed spot
Vocals'll squeeze glocks, MC's eavesdrop
Though they need not to sneak

Essence of adolescence leaves my body, fresh and
physical frame celebrated 'cause I made it
One quarter through life some Godly-like thing created
Got rhymes 365 days annual plus some
Load up the mic and bust one, cuss while I puffs from
My skull 'cause it's pain in my brain, vein, money maintain
Don't go against the grain, simple and plain
When I was young, I used to do my thing hard
Robbing foreigners, take their wallets, they jewelery
Rip their green cards
Dipped to the projects flashing my quick cash
Got my first piece of ass smoking blunts with hash
Now it's all about cash in abundance
Niggas I used to run with is rich or doing years in the hundreds
I switched my motto, instead of saying ""fuck tomorrow""
That buck that bought a bottle could've struck the lotto
At times I look back, loose cracks produce stacks
I cooked up and cut small pieces to get my loot back

Pack a 4-matic that crack your whole cabbage

Your telephone blowin', black stitches or fat shoelaces 
Peoples are petrol, dramatic automatic fo'-fo' I let blow 
And back down po-po when I'm vexed so 
My pen taps the paper then my brain's blank 
I see dark streets, hustlin' brothers who keep the same rank 
Pumpin' for somethin', some up-rise, plus some fail 
Judges hangin' niggas, uncorrect bails, for direct sales 
My intellect prevails from a hangin' cross with nails 
I reinforce the frail, with lyrics that's real
Word to Christ, a disciple of streets, trifle on beats 
I decipher prophecies through a mic and say peace

Musician, inflicting composition
Of pain, Scarface sniffing cocaine
Holding a M-16, with the pen I'm extreme, now
Bullet holes left in my peepholes
I'm suited up in street clothes
Hand me a nine and I'll defeat foes
Y'all know my steelo with or without the airplay
I keep some E&J, sitting bent up on the stairway
Or either on the corner betting Grants with celo champs
Laughing at base-heads, trying to sell some broken amps
G-Packs get off quick, forever niggas talk
Reminiscing about the last time the Task Force flipped
Yo they be running through my block shooting
Time to start a revolution, catch a body head for Houston
They caught us off guard, the Mac-10 was in the grass and
I ran like a cheetah with thoughts of an assassin
Pick the Mac up, told brothers, ""Back up,"" the Mac spit
Lead was hitting niggas one ran, I made him back flip
Heard a few chicks scream my arm shook, couldn't look
Gave another squeeze heard it click yo, my shit is stuck
It wouldn't shoot now I'm in danger
Pulled my shit back had three bullets caught up in the chamber
Now I'm runnin' to the building lobby
And it was filled with children probably couldn't see as high as I be
(So what you saying?) The game ain't the same
Got younger niggas pulling the triggers bringing fame to they name
And claim some corners, crews without guns are goners
In broad daylight, stickup kids, they run up on us
Fo'-fives and gauges, Macs in fact
Same niggas'll catch a back to back, snatching yo' cracks in black
There was a snitch on the block getting niggas knocked
So hold your stash until the coke price drop
I know this crackhead, who said she gotta smoke nice rock
And if it's good she'll bring ya customers in measuring pots, but yo
You gotta slide on a vacation
Inside information large niggas erasing they wives basin'

New York state of mind (where I live)

New York state of mind

Be having dreams that I'ma gangster, drinking Moets, holding Tecs
Making sure the cash came correct then I stepped
Investments in stocks, sewing up the blocks
To sell rocks, winning gunfights with mega cops
But just a nigga, walking with his finger on the trigger
Make enough figures until my pockets get bigger
I ain't the type of brother made for you to start testing
Give me a Smith and Wessun I'll have brothers undressing
Thinking of cash flow, Buddha and shelter
I get frustrated I'ma hijack Delta
In the P.J.'s, my blend tape plays, bullets are strays
Young bitches hoodrats it's like a maze
Full of black rats trapped, plus the Island is packed
From what I hear in all the stories when my peoples come back, black
I'm living where the nights is jet black
The fiends fight to get crack I just max, I dream I can sit back
And lamp like Capone, with drug scripts sewn
Or the legal luxury life, rings flooded with stones
I got so many rhymes I don't think I'm too sane
Life is parallel to Hell but I must maintain
And be prosperous, though we live dangerous
Cops could just arrest me, blaming us, we're held like hostages
It's only right that I was born to use mics
And the stuff that I write, is even tougher than dice
I'm taking rappers to a new plateau, through rap slow
My rhyming is a vitamin, Hell without a capsule
The smooth criminal on beat breaks
Never put me in your box if your shit eats tapes
The city never sleeps, full of villians and creeps
That's where I learned to do my hustle had to scuffle with freaks
I'ma addict for sneakers, twenties of Buddha and bitches with beepers
In the streets I can greet ya, about blunts I teach ya
Inhale deep like the words of my breath
I never sleep, 'cause sleep is the cousin of death
I lay puzzle as I backtrack to earlier times

I told him don't let niggas fool him
'Cause when the pistol blows a shot that's when a murder be the

Could've caught your man, but didn't look when you bucked up
Mistakes happen, so take heed never bust up
If the crowd catch him solo, make the right man bleed
Shorty's laugh was cold blooded as he spoke so foul
Only twelve trying to tell me that he liked my style
Then I rose, wiping the blunts ash from my clothes

It's yours
It's mine, it's mine, it's mine
Whose world is this?
(The world is yours, the world is yours)
It's mine, it's mine, it's mine
Can you believe it, I said the world is yours, believe it

To my man Ill Will, God bless your life
To my peoples throughout Queens, God bless your life
I trip, we box up crazy bitches
Aiming guns at all my baby pictures
Beef with housing police, release scriptures that's maybe Hitler's
Yet I'm the mild, money-getting style, rolling foul
The versatile, honey-sticking wild golden child
Dwelling in the Rotten Apple, you get tackled
Or caught by the devil's lasso, shit is a hassle
There's no days, for broke days we sell it: smoke pays
While all the old folks pray to Jesus, soaking their sins in trays
Of holy water, odds against Nas are slaughter
Thinking a word best describing my life to name my daughter
My strength, my son, the star, will be my resurrection
Born in correction, all the wrong shit I did, he'll lead a right direction
""How you living?"" Large, a broker charge cards are mediocre
You flipping coke or playing spit spades and strip poker?

What you want soldier, I thought I told ya
It's mine, it's mine
Whose world
The world, the world, up top
It's your world
It's mine, it's mine
Whose world is this?
(The world is yours, the world is yours)
Uh, break it down

I'm the young city bandit, hold myself down single-handed
For murder raps, I kick my thoughts alone, get remanded
Born alone, die alone, no crew to keep my crown or throne
I'm deep by sound alone, caved inside, 1,000 miles from home
I need a new nigga for this black cloud to follow
'Cause while it's over me it's too dark to see tomorrow
Trying to maintain, I flip, fill the clip to the tip
Picturing my peeps not eating can make my heartbeat skip
And I'm amped up, they locked the champ up, remember that
Mike Tyson back in the days
Stabbing women like the Phantom
The crew is lamping, Big Willie-style
Check the chip-toothed smile, plus I profile wild
Stash through the flock wools, burning dollars to light my stove
Blocks with a bop, checking dames, plus the games
People play, bust the problems of the world today

It's mine, it's mine
Whose world
I said the world is yours, the world is yours
Who's world? It's yours
I said the world is yours, the world is yours

To my Queensbridge crew, the foundation, the world is yours, the world is yours
To my people in B-More, the world is yours, the world is yours
All my peoples in VA, the world is yours, the world is yours
In the nation's capital, the world is yours, the world is yours",The World Is Yours,2018

I closed my eyes, drew back the curtain
To see for certain what I thought I knew
Far far away, someone was weeping
But the world was sleeping
Any dream will do

I wore my coat, with golden lining
Bright colours shining, wonderful and new
And in the east, the dawn was breaking
And the world was waking
Any dream will do

A crash of drums, a flash of light
My golden coat flew out of sight
The colours faded into darkness
I was left alone

The world and I, we are still waiting
Still hesitating

Se ela ficou, fico também

Se ela gostou, gosto com ela
Quero aprender, ela quer me ensinar

Será que ela gosta de mim

Já sou local no litoral
Saudade do planalto central
Nas ondas té que já to mandando bem
Pois aprendi o valor que elas têm

Quero voltar pro interior
Horizonte sem fim, cerrado nativo
Será que ela gosta de mim, comigo quer voltar
Quer aprender segredos de lá
Muitas coisas sonhei, momentos vivi

No litoral e no interior do país
Ela gosta de mim, hoje sou assim
