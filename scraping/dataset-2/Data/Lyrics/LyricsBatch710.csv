Melissa Auf der Maur,"Ooh love is fun
Care to dance?
You're a boy
I'm a girl
Are your ready?
Please?
Lot's of fish
In the sea
But is it her? 
Or me?
That's right
You'll see the light
All you need is me honey
Can't you see?
I'll be anything you want
You love me more than you love yourself
I'll be anything you want
You love me more than you love yourself
On my knees on my knees
Begging you darling please please please
Pick me, pick me, pick me
Someday I have to say
I'll be with you
Share a dance, romance
A little dinner for two
You'll be mine
I'm yours that's fine
Everything we've ever dreamed of baby
Is ours tonight
I'll be anything you want
You love me more than you love yourself
I'll be anything you want
You love me more than you love yourself
On my knees on my knees 
Begging you darling please
I'll be anything you want
You'll be anything I want
You love me more than you love yourself
You'll be anything I want
You love me more than you love yourself
On my knees on my knees
Begging you darling please
Pick me pick me
You finished with your woman
Cause she is not me",I'll Be Anything You Want,2004
Melissa Auf der Maur,"Goin' let the lightning 
Tuck me into my bed 
Gonna let that man 
Let him into my head 
I'll see you in my dreams 
Electrified and cherry red 

And I'll, meet you on the corner 
Under true blue skies 
Seeking cherry colo 
As the bridging wine 
To bring you to my lips, one more time 

Kissing on the corner 
I know it's a dream, 
It's better than day time, 
'Cause dream time lasts forever 
Swarming on the corner, 
Bringing rain, dream time is over 
â??Til lightning strikes again 

And I'll, meet you on the corner 
Under true blue skies 
Seeking cherry cola 
As the bridging wine 
To bring you to my lips, one more time 

The sun has crept in, 
Away with the night 
Good-bye to my lover 
I'm back in bed 
But lightning is my girl, 
And promises me 
To bring me to that corner, again and again 

And I'll, meet you on the corner 
Under true blue skies 
Seeking cherry cola 
As the bridging wine 
To bring you to my lips, one more time",Lightning Is My Girl,2004
Melissa Auf der Maur,"With her head in the clouds, 
She keeps her distance and keeps resisting 
They're so proud of what she's missing, 
She is so delighted 
Why must I find that falling down 
Brings my hopes high, oh so high 
Why must you cry when I fall down? 
It helps me with the truth inside 

The fear is tempting, 
It consumes them
The loving darkness they claim she's missing 
The job is hers to keep resisting 
The claiming unknown they're so proud of 
The job is hers to keep resisting
She is so delighted 
Why must I find that falling down 
Brings my hopes high, oh so high? 
Why must you cry when I fall down? 
The truth is mine; only mine 
Don't you know it's my foggy notion? 
So please don't cry when I fall down 
It helps me with the truth inside 

I hide, I hide
Joy to the foggy notions, in my room 
Got to get away, they'll be here soon 
Here's to the gloom of swine 
That you roamed oh so smooth 

Why must I find that falling down 
Brings my hopes high, oh so high? 
Why must you cry when I fall down?
The truth is mine, only mine 

So take it easy baby! 
Take it easy baby! 
Baby, baby, baby 
Ha, swine, ha, swine, ha, swine, ha",My Foggy Notion,2004
Melissa Auf der Maur,"So free and so fuck, so aroused
So alone I try to find the lie,
That lies beneath you, I try
Like a wave, I'm self-acclaimed

Real a lie, you're truly mine..

Real a lie, you're truly mine
I am that kind, living blind
Real a lie, I am that kind
Living blind, for a lie

Real a lie, you're truly mine
I am that kind, living blind
Real a lie, I am that kind
Living blind, for a lie

Behind closed doors your folded blind,
You're truly mine, from behind
Closed doors you meet me,
Like a wave, I'm self-acclaimed

Real a lie, you're truly mine..

Real a lie, you're truly mine
I am that kind, living blind
Real a lie, I am that kind
Living blind, for a lie

Real a lie, you're truly mine
I am that kind, living blind
Real a lie, I am that kind
Living blind, for a lie

Deep and so far, low down
Growing green, far above the waves
Got a lie, you and I
Wave, wave, wave

Doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo (4x)

Real a lie, you're truly mine
I am that kind, living blind
Real a lie, I am that kind
Living blind, for a lie
For a lie..

Melissa Auf der Maur,"Let's see a mortal type 
Receiver! 
This new one's made of skin, 
I can see her! 
She will get eaten up by 
All kind people! 
Avoid the eye of contact! 
She's seen it before 
And she still wants more 
Help came, but you can't fight fate 
Can't help the skin receiver! 
Crawling in, through your flesh stew, 
The brew's in all of you 
You're flying out of reason! 
Sexy wings you beware 
They'll come with reason! 
The stampede crushes you! 
She's seen it before 
And she still wants more 
Help came, but you can't fight fate 
Can't help the skin receiver!

Melissa Auf der Maur,"For today I'm lost without you
Forgot the way to be without you 
Yeah you know I would stay alone 
Yes I would if I could stay alone
But for today I'm lost without you 

I need a way to be without you
Need a way to find just a few of you
Yeah you know I would stay alone 
Yes I would if I could stay at home

Melissa Auf der Maur,"Under my tongue,
I carry a tune
Deep in the earth,
I can hardly reach 

My mind is humming and buzzing,
It's numbing
When I can't
Get it to you 

This melody is my carpet ride
'Cross the ocean to you and you
Reaching out to you through this tune
'Round the globe just to get it to you 

We've been singing the same song,
For over a thousand years
His death spoke to me,
And her birth sang in perfect harmony 

This melody is my carpet ride

Reaching out to you through this tune
'Round the globe just to get it to you 

We've been singing the same song,
For over a thousand years
His death spoke to me,
And her birth sang in perfect harmony 

My grave will bring me there,
Deep in the earth,
Singing that same old melody 

Before Adam,
Before Eve,
The lizard sang this melody,
Now it's twisted,
And it's torn
Baffy lines and all you bores
Pick a pack, the troops, it's time
We've got melodies to spin
Come on, bring, leaders and men,
We've got some miracles to spin 

Ooh, ooh
Ah, ah
Ah, ah

We've been singing the same song,
For over a thousand years
His death spoke to me,
And her birth sang in perfect harmony 

My grave will bring me there
Deep in the earth you'll find me
Singing that same, same, same old melody
Same old melody 

My grave will bring me there

Melissa Auf der Maur,"Many years ago,
As a little girl,
Saw a bright light,
In the darkest night 

22 below, 7 feet of snow,
Bundled up, determined, to make it there for certain 

The futile search of man,
Cuts across the land,
Bloody ships asail,
We hide behind a veil 

A greedy golden hand,
Swallowed by the sand,
Thy kingdom comes no more,
We're looking for the core 

Digging down determined
To get us there for certain
The center of the earth,
The heart of the universe 

Fire deep inside,
Spinning us through time,
The heart of the matter,
I hear it getting louder 

I'm your healer and you're mine
I'm your healer and you're mine
I'm your healer and you're mine
I'm your healer and you're mine

Melissa Auf der Maur,"Listen, sweet little girl,
Your father's gone below 

I know, I'm trying hard,
Trying to let go 

Just let me lead you,
To the ground where lies his heart 

With all these tears inside,
I'll surely fall apart 

It's time to face your loss,
Let your father go
He's gone, girl,
Down below 

Walk along this dirty path,
Enjoy the falling rain 

I'm scared to say goodbye,
To face his hidden pain 

It's time to free your loss,
Let your father go 

But I need your help, sweet sir,
You put him six feet below

I dug your father's grave

I'll put him in his grave

As I kiss your lips in the rain

Where have all the good men gone
And where are all the gods?
Where's the street-wise Hercules
To fight the rising odds?

Isn't there a white knight upon a fiery steed?
Late at night I toss and turn

And dream of what I need
I need a hero
I'm holding out for a hero 'til the end of the night
He's gotta be strong and he's gotta be fast
And he's gotta be fresh from the fight
I need a hero (New Directions: hero)
I'm holding out for a hero 'til the morning light ('til the morning light)

Ah, ah!

Somewhere after midnight
In my wildest fantasies
Somewhere just beyond my reach
There's someone reaching back for me

Racing on the thunder and rising with the heat
It's gonna take a superman to sweep me off my feet (oh!)

I need a hero

And he's gotta be larger than life
I need a hero
I'm holding out for a hero 'til the end of the night

Up where the mountains meet the heavens above
Out where the lightning splits the sea
I could swear that there's someone somewhere watching me

Through the wind and the chill and the rain
And the storm and the flood
I can feel his approach is like a fire in my blood

Like a fire in my blood, like a fire in my blood
Like a fire in my blood, like a fire in my
Blood, blood!

Oh!
I need a hero (hero)

Melissa Errico,"There's a saying old says that love is blind
Still were often told, seek and ye shall find
So I'm going to seek a certain lad I've had in mind
Looking everywhere, haven't found him yet

Hes the big affair I cannot forget
Only man I ever think of with regret
I'd like to add his initial to my monogram
Tell me, where is the shepherd for this lost lamb?

There's a somebody I'm longing to see
I hope that he turns out to be
Someone who'll watch over me
I'm a little lamb who's lost in the wood
I know I could always be good
Someone who'll watch over me

Although he may not be the man some
Girls think of as handsome
To my heart he carries the key
Won't you tell him please to put on some speed
Follow my lead, oh, how I need

Melissa Errico,"How do you keep the music playing?
How do you make it last?
How do you keep a song from fading too fast?

How do you lose yourself to someone?
And never lose your way
How do you not run out of new things to say?

And since we know we're always changing
Why should it be the same?
And tell me how year after year
You're sure your heart will fall apart
Each time you hear her name

I know the way you feel for her, it's now or never
The more I love, the more that I'm afraid
That in her eyes, I may not see forever, forever

Yet be the best of friends
If we can try with everyday to make it better
As it grows, with any luck, then I suppose

But all in love is fair
I turn the other cheek

Some other woman is making love to you

I got wings on these fingers trying to tear it apart
I got angels crying from up above
And they got rust in their eyes
They got rust on their love
But I have learned to leave no stone unturned
And keep the wall against my back
And the love is real as the day is long
And the night is black
As black as night

I got a two dollar stare
Midas in my touch and Delilah in my hair
I got bad intentions on the soles of my shoes
With this red hot fever and these chromium blues
And I will feel another lovers wheel
And drive for miles and not look back
And the love is real as the day is long
And the night is black
As black as night

On my chrome-plated heart
Wings on these fingers trying to tear it apart
I got angels crying from up above

And I understand their warning I understand their song
Since you left I feel the change in the air

I shout to the sky please

Come on let it rain
Let it rain down on me
Let the rain touch my hands
Let the rain set me free
Let it rain down on me

Silence is the steel that pierces and cuts me to the bone
In dreams the hand that touches you is mine and mine alone
Cruel is the light is the morning shining down on me
Hours with the Devil to understand just what you need
So I wake in the street and I call out your name
Shout to the sky come on

Come on let it rain
Let it rain down on me
Let the rain fill my eyes
Let the rain set me free
Let it rain down on me

Just inside the distance I hear the late September dogs
And so I beg for sleep the child who walked before she crawled
Damn my soul that remembers and clutches to this pain
The spear in your side is me

Let the rain touch my hands
Let the rain set me free

Melissa Etheridge,"Is it so hard to satisfy your senses?
You found out to love me you have to climb some fences
Scratching and crawling along the floor to touch you
And just when it feels right you say you found someone to hold you
Does she like I do

Baby tell me does she love you like the way I love you
Does she stimulate you, attract and captivate you
Tell me does she miss you existing just to kiss you
Like the way I do
Tell me does she want you, infatuate and haunt you
Does she know just how to shock and electrify and rock you
Does she inject you, seduce you and affect you
Like the way I do
Like the way I do

Can I survive all the implications
Even if I tried could you be less than an addiction
Don't you think I know there's so many others
Who would beg steal and lie, fight, kill and die
Just to hold you, hold you like I do

Baby tell me does she love you like the way I love you
Does she stimulate you, attract and captivate you
Tell me does she miss you existing just to kiss you
Like the way I do
Tell me does she want you, infatuate and haunt you
Does she know just how to shock and electrify and rock you
Does she inject you, seduce you and affect you
Like the way I do

Oh, nobody loves you, like the way I do
Nobody wants you, like the way I do
Nobody needs you, like the way I do
Nobody aches, nobody aches just to hold you
Like the way I do
No, no, no

Tell me does she love you like the way I love you
Does she stimulate you, attract and captivate you
Tell me does she miss you, existing just to kiss you
Like the way I do
Oh, tell me does she want you, infatuate and haunt you

Melissa Etheridge,"Go on and close your eyes, go on imagine me there
She got similar features with longer hair
And if that's what it takes to get you through
Go on and close your eyes, it shouldn't bother you

You never had to wait for nothing in your life
I guess wanting me must have been a steel blue knife
And when night after night the scent of passion would linger
You had to have the jewels wrapped around your finger
Now you keep running down the road in your midnight state of mind
Curiosity kills if you can't read the signs

Go on and close your eyes, imagine me there
She got similar features with longer hair
And if that's what it takes to get you through
Go on and close your eyes, it shouldn't bother you

Dancing with the wall made you bitter and sweet
There ain't much you can do when they just lay it at your feet
But you could tell by the song I wanted to be the one
Did you listen again when the damage was done
Now the paint's still wet in your do-it-by-number dream
Are you gonna tell me how it felt, will you tell me what it means

Go on and close your eyes, go on imagine me there
She got similar features with longer hair
And if that's what it takes to get you through
Go on and close your eyes, it shouldn't bother you

Was it want with no desire?
Was it smoke with no fire?
Did I say it doesn't rip me apart?
I lied
I'm sorry dear my hands are tied

Go on and close your eyes, go on imagine me there
She got similar features with longer hair
And if that's what it takes to get you through
Go on and close your eyes, it shouldn't bother you

Close your eyes, imagine me there

Melissa Etheridge,"I had a dream late last night
The water was running low
And my fields were on fire, burning my sky
My body was moving slow
And when I awoke I tasted the sweat of desire in my mouth
And I realized my heart had abducted my mind
And they were last seen headed south
Now I can't sleep I'm so wired
And I find myself screaming out

Don't you need don't you want
Can't you taste it when you're alone
Don't you cry don't you feel
Sometimes I wonder if you are real
Don't you bleed
Don't you need

There's no quenching the thirst there's no relief
For the hungry at heart
And as far as you're concerned I'm just a thief
Entertaining in the dark
But it's you that holds the cards
Now that the joker is wild

Don't you want to lay it down
And feel your skin against the ground
Don't you want to ride the storm
And then sleep inside the calm
Don't you want to get that high
Don't you want to be satisfied
Well if you don't want it from me
Don't you need

I had a dream late last night
The water was running low
And my fields were on fire burning my sky
How was I to know
That I burn every night in my dreams
And only morning can set me free

Across the room turn into lies and laughter
And asking for my name again
Then introduced as just a friend

I can't forget the naked trust
One quenchless night of shaking lust and fire

I want you
I want you
I want you
I want you

Since that night I'm not the same
Desire breeds an ugly stain inside me
Satisfaction never comes
It's always dark and yet I still run
Even when I close my eyes
You torture me with shameless sighs seduction
Walking in a chilling sweat
Pounding heart inside my chest I'm screaming

I want you

I want you
I want you

With your heart in your fist

I dreamed like a child of wonder
With my back in the grass
My eyes to the sky to see
I believed in the stars
I knew they cast a spell that I was under

I was part of the earth

I can't feel it

I refuse to believe
It could happen to me and you

And play house make vows to hang up their shoes
Do you sit and talk over coffee cups
Do headline mornings satisfy and fill you up

Saw the ones who twist her 
A social suicide 
If looks could kill 
Each and every cheap thrill 
Could be a homicide 
Wake me up when we hit 2001

It's barely alive with a story at five 
So turn your video on 
We live in these years dark age of fear 
Meet me in 2001

I've searching 
Searching for a reason 
To either fight or fly 
Either way patriot or treason 
It's gonna be one long hard ride 
Wake me up when we hit 2001",2001,1992
Melissa Etheridge,"Sometimes I know that it's never enough 
Survival is fine but satisfaction is rough 
I try with an angel tonight 
Spread these wings and I'm on for the ride 
Cruise these streets where my innocence hides 
There's some things you can't deny 
What is it about this human condition 
I need some kind of promise 
Some kind of submission tonight

I'm feelin' kinda loose, I'm feelin' kinda mean 
I've been feeling kinda wild since I turned seventeen 
Or, is it madness 
Tell me where can a woman find any kind of peace 
When does the fury and the agony cease 
How long have I got to say please 
There's a hole in my jeans I only wanted to fade 
I've been ripping out seams 
Somebody else made tonight

Melissa Etheridge,"Sometimes I feel like an innocent one
To deserve this fate what I have I ever done
I know that I made all the rules
But time can even change the hopeless ways of fools
I love you tonight like I did yesterday
I won't think of tomorrow or the price I pay
I drink from the well my soul is dry
I never know why

All I want is for your love to be all mine
But the angels won't have it
All I want is just a little peace of mind
But the angels won't have it
I thought I had a piece of my soul left to sell
I guess it's just as well
'Cause the angels won't have it

Who's looking after this see-through heart
Someone up there isn't doing their part
Oh Cupid you foolish boy
You should take better aim with your brand new toy
I love you tonight like I did yesterday

The innocent one whose heart could never break
Lift me up take me out of this bed
Watching the angels shake their heads
Don't feel sorry for me baby honey don't you cry
You can sell all of my clothes you will forget me by and by
I'll be riding that train I'll be singing that song

But all in love is fair
I turn the other cheek

And I know you're only human
And I haven't got talking room
But tonight while I'm making excuses
Some other woman is making love to you

Somebody bring me some water
Can't you see I'm burning alive
Can't you see my baby's got another lover
I don't know how I'm gonna survive
Somebody bring me some water

Will this night be through
Wanna hear the breaking glass

And these lips are getting weak

Why she can't climb out of the sand
And break away

Is the coming of your age

And turn it into rage

For wings to set you free

To satiate the need

There is nothing between you and I

Your body your power can sanctify
Come feed your hunger your thirst
Lay it down the beast will die
You can question my heart once again

Am I your passion your promise your end
I say I am
Yes I am
Your passion your promise your end
Yes I am

I will ride destiny's trail
To believe when the truth comes up empty
To hold and respect without fail
Come and be one in the motion

With only one headlight
A straight six Ford
On a good luck night

The kind you can't buy

I want to lose all your demons and go
I want to tear off your chains 'cause I know

All the way to heaven is heaven
Caught between the spirit and the dust
All the way to heaven is heaven
Deep inside of us

I want to find me a bar
With a blue light on
Dollar shot specials
A bartender named Dawn
Painting the town
Selling the farm
You can pierce your nose
And I'll tattoo my arm

I want to lose all your demons and go
I want to tear off your chains 'cause I know

All the way to heaven is heaven
Caught between the spirit and the dust
All the way to heaven is heaven
Deep inside of us

Outside of town
A tilt-a-whirl set up
With a merry-go-round
Cotton candy fingers
And a snow cone mouth
I want to roll you in sawdust
Till they run us both out

Melissa Etheridge,"Take, take a look at the sky
Sometimes your heaven seems to far away
Take, take a look under here
Where deprivation turns into decay
I've stood under this rain, felt it seep into my brain
I've shut my eyes and crawled around this mud
I'm scared of growin' old, I shiver when I'm cold
Don't you think I bleed the same blood?

I, I could've been you, you could've been me
One small change that shapes your destiny
If you want the proof, cut me and you'll see
I could've been you, you could've been me

Wait, wait before you turn off
Maybe there's a chance we can relate
Wait, everybody turns on
Why deny a fact that's so innate?
It's not so easy anymore, the way you used to keep score
Not so black and white, the color of your sin
Take a walk inside my shoes, a path I didn't choose
Spend the night inside of my skin

I, I could've been you, you could've been me
One small change that shapes your destiny
If you want the proof, cut me and you'll see
I could've been you, you could've been me

Change is turning into fear, fear is melting into hate
With hate you justify your crime, a crime compassion can erase
Erase
Erase

Touch, touch what I feel
And know I believe everything I say
So go, go if you must
Remember one thing as you walk away:

I, I could've been you, you could've been me

Down past an old shack
On a road that goes to nowhere
Ain't nobody coming back
We can go there tonight
We can talk until dawn
Or maybe something else
I'll leave the radio on

There's no one to hear

And we got nowhere to go

Past the Wal-Mart and the prison
Down by the old V.A. 
Just my jeans and my t-shirt
And my blue Chevrolet
It's Saturday night
Feels like everything's wrong
I've got some strawberry wine
I want to get you alone

Down by the muddy water
Of the mighty Mo
In an old abandoned box car

Melissa Etheridge,"I wonder what you're doing
In the night out there
Is a sad summer breath tangled in your hair
Can you hear the lonely engines
Screaming through the town
There's no where to run
When the darkness comes down

Is there a song inside of you
That you tried to forget
Like your fake ID and your mom's cigarettes
Does it take you back
Is the vision intense
You and me in Shriner's Park
Trying to make some sense

You were just seventeen
But your laughter was mild
You liked my dreams you thought I was wild
Is there a rhythm in your step now
That reminds you of a dance
Do you push it all away
Cause you never took the chance

You'd sneak out your window
When I'd come for you
I'd be waiting in the street light on 8th Avenue
You'd slip into my car
We'd drive down past the fence
You and me in Shriner's Park
Trying to make some sense

Did you feel like you were crazy
When they sent you far away
Did no one have the answers
When you hung your head to pray
You could not let yourself dream
Never dare believe
You could ever be more
Than you were born to be

Do you lock up your house
Like you locked up your past
If I were to call
Could you free me at last
Could you slip into my car
Could we drive down past the fence

I had to tell my Jimmy we're through
He stood there and asked me why, but all I could do was cry
I'm sorry I hurt you, the leader of the pack

He sort of smiled and kissed me good bye
The tears were beginning to show
As he drove away on that rainy night,
I begged him to go slow, whether he heard,
I'll never know  Look out! Look out! Look out!

Love Child, born  in poverty,
Love Child, never meant to be, 
Love Child, take a look at me.
 
I started my life in an old, cold, rundown tenement slum.
My father left, he never even married Mom.
I shared the guilt my mama knew,
So afraid that others knew I had no name.
 
This love we're contemplating, is worth the pain of waiting.
We'll only end up hating the child we may be creating.

Love Child, by society,

I knew the way it was to always live in doubt, 
To be without the simple things,

Don't think I don't want to please you.
No child of mine'll be bearing the name of shame I've been wearin'.

They know I'm crazy for you
And so we dance
And the beat gets lost
And this jealous fool
Will pay the cost for you
On Cherry Avenue

Is this a crime
Or just a clever scheme
I want to make you mine
All your roads are green
And I promise not to show you what I've seen
Now it's closing time

Beetle kills the lights

Melissa Etheridge,"We were all wounded in some domestic war 
I found you to settle my score 
You looked like father 
You felt like mother

There is no other 

And I gave you my soul 
And every ounce of control 
I gave you my skin 
And my original sin 
I gave you my pride and my side 
Oh my pride 

Ain't that enough 
I turned your dreams into lightning 
Ain't that enough 
I held the world back for you 

Ain't that enough 
I loved you past the point of dying 
Ain't that enough of me for you 

I was so sure one and one gave you one 
My noisy love is coming undone 
Now you leave like father 
Disappointed like mother 
And I know in my heart 
There is no other 

And I gave you my soul 
And every ounce of control

And my eternal flame 
And I gave you my need and my seed

In the next hello 

How would I know

If you wanted to go

I was falling falling deep 
You were there you were small 
There was screaming down the hall 

I've been here sleeping all these years 

There comes a time we all know 
There's a place that we must go 
Into the soul into the heart 
Into the dark 

There was fire there was death 
There was lying on your breath 
I turned away I would pretend 
But the burning never ends 

I've been here sleeping all these years 

There was a wave over the house 
There was fear choked in my mouth 
You were there you left your mark 
As I stumbled in the dark",Into the Dark,1999
Melissa Etheridge,"What's this little lie 
They keep on telling me 
It's just another high 
They keep on selling me 
I was only five 
They fed me so much jive 
They said just have a ball Just be a Barbie doll 
They churned and burned me out 
Until they turned me out 
Over and over again 

Mama I'm strange 
The thoughts and the wants are the locks 
On the back of my brain 
I'm descending pretending I'm blending 
I'm going insane 
And they want me to change 
Mama I'm strange 

I'm on a shaky wall 
I'm tripping down the hall 
And all the king's men can't 
Can't sew me up again 
I've got a leaky head 
Don't know the full extent 
I'm drowning in my bed 
I'm just an accident 
They chewed and blew me out 
Until they threw me out 
Over and over again

I might just vaporize

They couldn't criticize

I have no innocence

No one reveals me like 
My lover 
No one can disconnect 
No one can resurrect

My lover makes me weak 
Gives me breath to speak 
My lover takes me home 
Cools the rolling stone 
My lover's thorny kiss 
The reason to exist 
I wonder 

No one can saturate 
No one manipulates 
Like my lover 
The sensuality 
It's immortality 
My lover 

My lover needs to seize 
Bring me to my knees 
Reads me like a prayer 
Calls the spirit there 
Secretly inspires 
Strips me to desire

No one can make me rise

They'll never ever pay the price

Seep into a nation calling up a flood 
Of narrow minds who legislate 
Thinly veiled intolerance

They beat you and they tied you 
They left you cold and breathing 
For love they crucified you 

I can't forget hard as I try 
This silhouette against the sky 

Scarecrow crying 
Waiting to die wondering why 
Scarecrow trying 
Angels will hold carry your soul away 
This was our brother 
This was our son 
This shepherd young and mild 
This unassuming one 
We all gasp this can't happen here 
We're all much too civilized 
Where can these monsters hide 

But they are knocking on our front door 
They're rocking in our cradles 
They're preaching in our churches 
And eating at our tables 

I search my soul 
My heart and in my mind 
To try and find forgiveness 
This is someone child 
With pain unreconciled 
Filled up with father's hate 
Mother's neglect 
I can forgive But I will not forget

Just inside your arm 
I want to listen to your heart beat 
And your breathing on and on 
I want to lay down on your shoulder 
Surrender to your peace 
And go to sleep 

And when we've gone a million miles 
Made true our dreams with sweat and bone 
After we've built it up with our bare hands 
Made strong a place we can call home 

And when the light in my eye is fading 
When running water becomes too deep 
Finally angels turn my fire to dust 
And when my soul's no longer mine to keep 

I want to lay down on your shoulder 
Just inside your arm 
I want to listen to your heartbeat 
And your breathing on and on 
I want to lay down on your shoulder

And just go to sleep",Sleep,1999
Melissa Etheridge,"So you closed your eyes in the morning 
You said you want to start smoking again 
You said you had that dream last night 
Of the stranger in your room 
You said you want to start making new friends 
Well I'd found some peace 
You want release 
You must be stronger than me 

I don't know how you can take it 
Invest your heart and then you break it 
I don't know how you can set it free 
You must be stronger than me 
Set it up but it's not perfect 
Tear it down cause it's not worth it 
If someone else can light your mystery 
They must be stronger than me 

So I closed my eyes at midnight 
Cinderella must go home 
But the map was burned 
And I've taken a wrong turn 
And I found myself alone 
I'm tired of this war 
I don't want to fight no more 
You must be stronger than me 

So it's too late then

And I'd just like to know if you will
Oh could I even get there

Oh
Back to the touch and go
When not a soul could know
When your lovin' was slow
We lived every night for the touch and go

Now there's no one in the night to blame you
No one in your glasses of wine
I never won I only tamed you
Foolishly I called you mine
And your pacing in your cage every morning
And you rattle your chains every night
And you stare past the bars never knowing
With nothing left to put up a fight

Oh
Then we would touch and go
When not a soul could know
Oh your lovin' was slow
And we lived every night for the touch

And I'll try to let you know 
It's all I know 

There is no magic 
There are no secrets 
We all begin this race at the start 
But I have come this far 
With a truth of the heart 

Deep down inside 
I think we're all the same 
Try not to judge someone 
And never shame 
I do believe that people are good 
They just want hope and respect 
And to be understood 

Sometimes it hard sometimes it's strange 
But the truth of the heart is people can change 

Yes there is danger and there are shadows 
And there is fear inside the dark 
It has powered countries and borne religion 
Fear can never rule the heart

You tried to hold us back
You tried to make us wrong

And you will not make me fall
And you will not make me crawl

And I'm not alone
Winds of change have blown
And the walls come tumbling down

And I've learned from my mistakes
Picked myself up off the floor
I have learned just what it takes
Now I am stronger than before
And we are standing side by side
We are determined now to win
We have come too far
And we've got the scars
And we are never going back into the shadows again

Melissa Etheridge,"Hello yes that's what I said
I guess I thought that I was dead
So I just called you from my bed to say hello
You see I got this funny notion
Life is only just an ocean
I've been drowning in emotion
Now I'm swimming back to shore
And I'd like to talk to you

I'll be alone

Yes it's been a couple days
Okay seven this I know
But I've been movin' kinda slow
So I called oh it must be so appalling
If you think that I've been stalling
This is me now I am calling
And I'm better than before
And I'd like to talk to you

Don't you want to know don't you want to be
Someone who takes a chance
On a fool like me
Staring at the door 
Staring down the hall 
Waiting my whole life just for you to call

Hello yes that's what I said
I am breathing I'm not dead
I'm waiting here now in my bed

I'll go anywhere that you want to go
I'll jump into my car
Go down to that bar
Pretend I'm someone that you don't know

I'll ask you if you would like to dance
Slip myself up close to your thighs
You can buy me a drink
We'll make everyone think
That love is so damn perfect tonight

Kiss me, kiss me
Kiss everything away
Oh honey now kiss me, kiss me
Kiss me come out and play

A woman can go crazy I know
Workin' all day in and day out
We'll let off some steam
Create a scene
Nothing like a good scream and shout

Your kiss is like medicine
A prescription to ecstasy
And your mind is my playground

My shock induced insane self medication
You looked at me and smiled
Said get ready to get wild

I want to see how lucky Lucky can be
I want to ride with my Angel and live shockingly
I want to drive to the edge and into the sea
I want to see how lucky Lucky can be

I looked like hell twisted up and tangled
You whispered in my ear
The ghosts are gone it's clear
For too long you've been tied up you've been strangled

Don't want to be a quaint observer on this super sonic ride

And ten and ten again
I have seen too much to pretend
Then you wanted to come in
I have survived all of the lies
They made me wise
The locks and walls and the peace it buys
Still when I look into your eyes
It's a surprise when you say

It's gonna be all right
It's gonna be okay
Just hold on tight
Let it all go away

Oh mercy mercy baby
What do you want from me

Well I plead mercy mercy baby
I do not know what this all means
It's been awhile since I been stylin'
In just my jacket and my jeans
It hurts to walk it hurts to talk
It hurts to think about it
Shout about it
Could I be sure without a doubt
That you could never live without me

I want to fall in you crawl in you
Surrender all in you now
Could I be sure in you pure in you
Finding the cure in you
Now I plead have mercy on me

Now I am kneeling at the alter
In the temple of your eyes
And I am asking for a miracle
I have been too long paralyzed
When you say get up and stand up
And climb the rope of hope
And open up again
Oh the peace you say is promised me
Seems too much to comprehend",Mercy,2004

You can't resist it to be twisted in her suicidal thighs

Skippin' and dodgin'
From a 44

10:03 on a Tuesday morning
In the fall of an American dream
A man is doing what he knows is right
On flight 93
He loved his mom and he loved his dad
He loved his home and he loved his man
But on that bloody Tuesday morning
He died an American

Now you cannot change this
You can't erase this
You can't pretend this is not the truth

Even though he could not marry
Or teach your children in our schools
Because who he wants to love
Is breaking your Gods' rules
He stood up on a Tuesday morning
In the terror he was brave
And he made his choice
And without a doubt
A hundred lives he must have saved

And the things you might take for granted
Your inalienable rights
Some might chose to deny him
Even though he gave his life
Can you live with yourself in the land of the free
And make him less of a hero than the other three
Well it might begin to change ya

On the long hard road into Southern Cal
Didn't find any crime 
In filling up all my time
I had the devil in my bones
And an angel on my mind
And I drank up all the movies
And I searched for happy endings
I turned love inside out 
Till I was perfectly pretending
Still I believed it could be true

When you find the one
There's no questioning the silence
All is said and done
When you find the one

I was that kind of girl
I had to open up a lot of oysters
Before I found myself a pearl 
I had to kiss a lot of frogs
To find my grass was green enough
Had to be face down in the gutter
To see what is and isn't love
Then I woke from all the dreaming
To your taste and to your laughter
I cried till I was dry
And now I live my ever after
I believed I always knew

To paint tonight

Will you still love me anyway
Will you still need me when you're victorious 
Will you still want me when I've nothing to say
Will you still love me anyway

On the live wire
Under the gun

Hey mister send my baby home
This December I don't want to be all alone

I need you in my arms
Far away from harm
Mister send my baby home

No wait that deck the halls
And the teenagers with candy canes
Ramble through the malls
The girls are down at Ruby's
Trying to find some Christmas cheer

When everyday's unclear
So here I am on Christmas eve

Bury the truth that scars my chest

Side by side in battle,
Did we bravely leave our home?
Did I hold you in my arms,
As you were taking your last breath?
Did shout to all the gods,
That I would love you beyond death?
I swear I've loved you before.

Did we hide in the dark ages,
From a vengeful god above?
Were our names too unfamiliar,
To ever speak of love?
Did I cling to every moment with you,


In every parting glance?
An accidental touch,
Did we ever take the chance for more?
I know I've loved you before.

Have I wandered through the desert?
Have I looked to the north star?
Have I rode the days and nights on rails,
To get back where you are?
And every time I found you
It's your eyes I know for sure.

When I think of how you know me,
No doubts no thinking twice.
When your smile can be so soothing,
A familiar paradise.
When there's no one else that makes me whole.
I am never wanting more.
I get this feeling.
I know I've loved you before.

I know I've loved you before
I've loved you before.",I've Loved You Before,2007
Melissa Etheridge,"A mother was grieving her loss
Her soldier the ultimate cost
She went to the man
Who has been told he's a king
Waited outside of his compound
To ask him a few things

She said ""for what noble cause
Did my son have to die?
Tell me where are there weapons?
Why did you have to lie?""

In his heart and his soul he believes
In the land of the free
And the home of the brave
Now he's standing on trial
For he will not behave
As they wish

To defend it and uphold
I will not fight your war for profit
No sir I will not go""

The smallest of life he has seen
Inside matter inside atoms
As far as you can go
He saw the strings of life that vibrate
With the universal flow

And all our intentions""

And you made a little deal
That got you on the tv
Everyone agreed you had the carm and the appeal

So you bought yourself a house in the hollywood hills
You bought yourself a tan
You fixed your nose and hair
Learned how not to care

Melissa Etheridge,"If you ask me I will say I'm fine
All pink like birthday girls and valentines
And then the stillness of the night reminds
That I don't like to be alone
My thoughts are race cars running 'round my head
They burst into flames and they crash into my bed
Until I fall into a dream instead
Where all my lovers turn to stone

And all I want is company
Someone to understand this misery
Send a reflection of myself to me
Cause everybody needs some company

These times I'm living in just make no sense
Sometimes my face gets pushed against the fence
I want to scream out in my self-defense
But I don't want to be alone

And all I want is company
Someone to understand this misery
Send a reflection of myself to me
Cause everybody needs some company

What is truth and what is fear
Will I find it under here
I know they're selling me a lie
But I'm first in line to buy
First in line to try

I find some sanity on the written page
Where life is worth more than a living wage
They say the battle's over now it's time to change
And I won't ever be alone

And all I want is company
Someone to understand this misery
Send a reflection of myself to me
Cause everybody needs some company
Someone to understand this misery
Send a reflection of myself to me
Cause everybody needs some company
I need some company
Some company",Company,2010
Melissa Etheridge,"Did you think I was leaving
My ticket was just one way
The angels I believed in
Were gonna carry me away
Did you think that I would simply
Give them my last breath
Well honey you've got me wrong
I'd never leave you for death

It's gonna take more than that to get rid of me
It's gonna take more than that to make me fade
They'll have to tie me up and drag me away
They'll have to shut my mouth and drag me away

I am not here to please
I will not be a hostage

Come on out and hold me
Out into the great sunlight

Both become one tonight

I have never been more sure of anything
I have never been more sure of what I am

There's no force that can drag me away

Melissa Etheridge,"When my soul crashed into my body
Falling into consciousness
That's when my mind began this illusion
Of taking it step after step
I looked into mother's eyes
I said tell me what I should believe
She drew me a room with a light and said 
Just turn it off when you leave

Slow, slow, this river is slow
We're all out here on our own
Row, row, gently we row
One day we'll find our way home

Step after step
They drew me a town 
They drew me a fear and a need
They drew me a god and 
They drew me some money
Hiding the truth far from me

I asked the cool fire light 
Tell me, what I should believe
And they gave me a song 
And they gave me a dance
And said sleep now your pain will relieve

Slow, slow, this river is slow
And we're all out here on our own
Row, row, gently we row
And one day we'll find our way home

I've stumbled and crawled
I've begged to know why 
And I've been ashamed 
When I've chosen to lie
In all of this darkness 
I have searched for a light 
To come and find me
And when I found me 

I wrapped my arms round 
My own daughter as she fell into her place and time 
And as her mind creates her illusions 
I won't complicate her's with mine

She looked into her mother's eyes 
She said tell me what I should believe
And I drew her a door 
And I drew her a key 
And I said when you're ready you'll come and find me
And we'll walk out of here and tomorrow will be a new day

Slow, slow, this river is slow
And you are never out here on your own
Row, row, gently we row 

Oh 
And together we'll find our way
Slow, slow, this river is slow
Life is not what it seems
Row, row, gently we row

The truth is
It's only a dream",Gently We Row,2010
Melissa Etheridge,"I grew up in silence
From silence I became my history
They fed me fear and violence
They hooked me up to this reality
Now I'm not cursing anyone
They only did what they had done to them
But if you want to know where I am now
Then just breathe in and let it out

When you are at the end of your rope
Come find me
Holding on to your last string of hope
Come find me
Open up your eyes
I'll show you what your worth
Don't you know it's you and me
In this heaven on earth

When I laid down my burden
The one where I had something I should prove
Then I found my power
The one where I'm the mountain I could move

Papa turned his head and said
I don't believe she's mine
Single momma raised her in a place where
You can look but never touch
Cause we don't have enough
Don't let your hopes get high
Cause girls like you can't fly

Oh the long nights in the small room
With the big dreams
Oh Indiana
You're only dying here
And they don't understand you
It's a tough road but you start slow
And before you know it
You're not alone
Looking for a place called home anywhere
Oh Indiana

She tended bar in New York City
People turned their heads and said
Baby you sure look fine
They put her on TV and then they told her
You're gonna be a star
You can go so far
Let your hopes get high
Cause girls like you can fly

In the long nights in the small room
With the big dreams
Oh Indiana
You're only dying, here
And they don't understand you
It's a tough road but you start slow
And before you know it
You're not alone
Looking for a place called home, anywhere

Those big dreams are flying machines
And they'll take you
Wherever you want to go
Oh and sometimes you find that what's real is inside
You don't have to go away
To find your way home
Oh Indiana

She turned around and she topped running
She saw that fame was never an answer to her prayers
She found that answer in her children
When she takes them to a place
Where they can have so much
She lets their hopes get high
Cause anyone, anyone can fly

In the long nights in the small room
With the big dreams
Oh Indiana
You're only dying, here

It was divorce that made him stay

A puppet or a slave

When did I begin the fight

Fighting to believe the lie

I never had to serve somebody

Who’s losing their minds
Keeping it together
Is everyone’s favourite pastime

Everybody’s had some really, really bad
Some this has got to be the end
I would really like to try for you
Sit around and cry for you
Muster up some sympathy

You try so hard to be discreet
With all your secrets in the sheets
As you solemnly refuse
The very spark that lights your fuse

Yeah on any given day
And I just end up feeling guilty
And I don't know how many times I've told you
I do not know how I ended up this way
It's as if sometimes I have just halted
Yeah I stop dead in my tracks
Life it just seems to cover me
And it's in these moments that I feel trapped

So I claim freedom
Yeah I claim my freedom

So what is it exactly that you want from me
Oh yeah you want me to stay
Even though I am terrified
To let myself
End up this way
Yeah I'm afraid of feeling
Of feeling nothing at all
And I'm afraid of settling down
Into a love
Just ain't love at all

So I claim my freedom
Yeah I claim I claim freedom

So take this brain out and hang it on the line
Take this chair out back and burn it
'Cause I can't get any work done from in here
You know this hole I dug myself in
Has got me buried up to helpless

And I'd like to call you a liar
Yeah but that's what you
Isn't that what you always called me

To cross this sea of loneliness, part this red river of pain
I don't necessarily buy any key to the future or happiness
But I need a little place in the sun sometimes
Or I think I will die

Everywhere is somewhere and nowhere is near
Everybody got somebody with their wine and their beer
So I'm just this tragic figure in the corner over here
With an empty apartment
And call my best friend who's queer

Every time I see him he smiles
And he tells me how well he's walking these miles
But he never ever asks a single thing about me
If I die, he'd hear about it eventually

Than every season would bring
New songs the wind would sing

I thought I had to be strong
To somehow earn this love

There’s no sin, there’s no shame, all the way back to the Father

Love's lasting light comes shining on and on

But we are here, you need not walk alone
To face, not fear each coming new unknown
Is the way to lift your wings

And the greatest gift I will ever know

There is but one that belongs to you
So let it grow and it will thrive on love
For it is love that sees us through

You have the hopes this world is waiting for
You are my own but you are so much more
You are tomorrow on the wing, child of mine

85 percent swear they know you, 10 percent you know they stories
Man, tha other 5 time to show you, just know you

I just know what I want
No point in holding on

So we can have a better life, girl

You did what you had to do so we could survive

Keep trying to make it through the next turn, knuckles white and holdin' tight.

It's like you're standing right with me all the time.
You hear me (you hear me), you're near me (you're near me),
And everything else is gonna be alright.
'Cause nothing can break this, nothing can break this, nothing can break this tie.
Connected, oh connected inside.

It's not an accident, the time we spent apart.
But now we're so close, I can always find you right here in my heart.
You've given me somethin' I need, and I don't ever want it to end.
Because of you, I know I've found my strength again.

Every time that I breathe, I can feel the energy.
Reachin' out, flowin' through, you to me and me to you. wake or dream,
Walk or stand, you are everywhere I am.
Separate souls, unified, touching at the speed of light.

À toi, je t'écris cette lettre, toi qui ne devrais pas exister
Mais qui est si souvent présente
Toi qui me rends si malheureuse
Par ta faute surviennent mes larmes et mon mal-être
Ta présence me fait souffrir
Je t'en supplie, rends-moi mes rêves, mon amour et du goût à la vie
Et disparais à jamais !

Tu peines à me fuir mais je suis une part de toi-même

J'écris cette lettre de mon coeur et je l'adresse à la tristesse
J'entends chanter des violons qui pleurent une tragédie

Avec toi survient le froid qui glace et gène mes joies
Et échoue mes espoirs et mon blues de toi
J'ai beau essayer de fuir tu m'colles à la peau
J'ai cette impression que je tente d'échapper à moi-même
Ne m'en veux pas de t'écrire
À l'encre de tes mots
Laisse-moi et reprends tes peines

T'as balafré mes sourires
Etouffé mes rires
Changé un soupire
Mes plus beaux rêves et mes souvenirs !
T'as vieilli mon innocence, flétri ma jeunesse
Mes moments d'insouciance ne sont pas ce qu'ils paraissent
Rends moi donc le goût d'aimer, l'envie d'être aimée
Tu sembles t'en aller mais tes absences ne sont que trêves
Sagement déserter au bonheur des années
Laisse-moi et rends-moi mes rêves !

And so she takes her summer time
Tells the moon to wait and the sun to linger
Twists the world 'round her summer finger
Lets you see the wonder of her arm?

And if you've learned your lesson well
There's little more for her to tell

Never ending or beginning on an ever spinning reel
Like a snowball down a mountain, or a carnival balloon
Like a carousel that's turning running rings around the moon
Like a clock whose hands are sweeping past the minutes of its face
And the world is like an apple whirling silently in space
Like the circles that you find in the windmills of your mind!
 
Like a tunnel that you follow to a tunnel of its own
Down a hollow to a cavern where the sun has never shone
Like a door that keeps revolving in a half forgotten dream
Or the ripples from a pebble someone tosses in a stream
Like a clock whose hands are sweeping past the minutes of its face
And the world is like an apple whirling silently in space
Like the circles that you find in the windmills of your mind!
 
Keys that jingle in your pocket, words that jangle in your head
Why did summer go so quickly, was it something that you said?
Lovers walking along a shore and leave their footprints in the sand
Is the sound of distant drumming just the fingers of your hand?
Pictures hanging in a hallway and the fragment of a song
Half remembered names and faces, but to whom do they belong?
When you knew that it was over you were suddenly aware
That the autumn leaves were turning to the color of her hair!

With her baggage of bad times, her presence from the past
Made the elders eyes to wander when she cried
If you're looking for my love, pass me by

She was gonna be a dancer, gifted by gods and kings
And it all came so natural moving on angel's wings
She said,""Ruby, you knew me when my life was gay
But if you're looking for my heart, look away""

Now the elders she passes seem to stop and stare
It's a shame about the dancer
And the poor boy she left there
But, Ruby, you loved me well
The elders knew it too
So will you take me with you now or they have taken you

I am not bad or crazy; I live here in a forest
I see things through a rainbow, I am a blossom come alive
They have no way with changes, they come in faceless numbers

I just want to be the one
Who keep you from the rain
From the rain

And it looks like sunny skies
Now that I know you're alright
Time has left us 
Older
And wiser
I know I am

But it doesn't matter
'Cause I love you anyway

It's the mother and father of love
It is out there and inside your mind

Your defenses against all your fears
How you bounce back
When you start to fall
And it's all in the climb

'cause she didn't want parades just passin' by her
So she painted on a smile and took up with some clown
While she danced without a net upon the wire

Baby is an awful lot like me

Don't cry out loud
Just keep it inside, learn how to hide your feelings
Fly high and proud
And if you should fall, remember you almost had it all

Baby saw that when they pulled that big top down
They left behind her dreams among the litter
The different kind of love she thought she'd found
There was nothin' left but sawdust and some glitter
But baby can't be broken 'cause you see
She had the finest teacher-that was me-I told 'er

Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb
Always reminding me that we're apart
You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms
The nightingale 
Tells his fairytale

I was raised on the good books of mornin'
And I learned how to laugh and get by.
I was gamin' and pleasin',
With never a reason why.

So the promise of heaven was broken
And I held on and I didn't care.
Just a dance for a changer, 
A stranger to brush my hair.

And I shine like a star, I burn out, down to die.
Crawlin' back to my hurt and my heart, hear me cry.

Oh my heart, I cry
Oh my heart, I cry

For the love lyin' somewhere in me
For the devil in dark night

Climb up and feel the sun.

Telling me what to do with my life
Leaving me no choices
Putting me through changes

We'd go to bed real early

Keep it burning strong
Outside it could be storming, but we
Never felt so warm

World for our love song

Got no one else to go to
'Cause I keep thinking of you even
When I'm not alone
Now I'd love to hear you say I'm still
The one you can't say ""no"" to
And that's you'll take me back tonight

Melissa Manchester,"Grace and John are in their morning places
He looks at the paper: she looks straight ahead
Neither one is hungry, but they need to be fed.
Yesterday the kids came by to see them,
Celebrating 30 years of holding on,
Lift a loving cup, a cup of number one.

Chorus

?Look across the table John, look across the table to me?;
There?s still a young girl in the old girls face.
?Look across the table honey.?
So the day begins, through the eyes of Grace.

Late at night, when she can hear him sleeping,
Reaching in the darkness for a dream or two;
What she doesn?t know is that he?s dreaming too,
Something in the mirror will remind her;
Something ?bout the moonlight shining on the bed;
Women don?t get older, just a deeper shade of red.

Chorus

?Tell me what to do Johnny, tell me what to do with all this freedom!?
?Tell me what to do Honey, tell me what to do ?bout all my dreamin?!?
Just to catch his eye when she?s not looking, just to be surprised by such an old idea.
Just to see your life seen thought the eyes of Grace.

?Look across the table John, look across the table to me?;
There?s still a young girl in the old girls face.
More than just a memory.
So the day begins, through the eyes of Grace.

(Basonova intro)

Afternoons on the Rue de Flores
In the flat that I shared with Gertrude
We served tea and got drunk on conversations
With the lost generation she found.

Hemingway, Picasso and Matisse
Janet Flanders and Sylvia Beach.
We were searching for unknown destinations
We were desperate to reach.

We [said au revoir?], [lyrics in brackets are disputable ..]
We carved our dreams,
To invent the world, it seems,
As life unraveled at the seams,

But oh ....

When Paris was a woman,
When Paris was a woman,
When Paris was a woman,
She loved so well.
All the smoke and opinions would fly!
Life was art, art was life, or else die ..
So we cared for each word and every color 
Like a bug on the web [to explain]


As the days blended into the nights,
How we savoured our city of lights -
And we knew it wouldn't last forever,
But my god what a ride!

When Paris was a woman,
When Paris was a woman,
When Paris was a woman,
She loved so well.
She loved so well.

My Gertrude -
She was my shepherdess,
My Pyrenees.
With eagle eyes, a mountain range was she.
She sore loved me.
We sore loved. 

When Paris was a woman ...

(Guitar solo)

The escapades,
The rigolos.
The geniuses,
The gigolos.
The legacy we left ...
Who knows?

But oh ...

When Paris was a woman,
When Paris was a woman,
When Paris was a woman,
She loved so well.
She loved so well.
We loved.

When Paris was a woman,
When Paris was a woman,
When Paris was a woman,
She loved so well.

And though there's darkness all around us
By my faith I know you're there
Give me the strength to lead the way
Send me the words I need to say
Use me to guide them day to day
This is a father's prayer
I know I can't do this by my self
I thank you for your help
I know you're listening so I know I'm not alone
I feel you here with me as we all face the unknown
Could you return us to your garden
Where no one's hurt and no one's scared
Free us from pride and bitterness
Keep us so close we won't forget
Teach us to love as you love
This is a mother's prayer
This is a father's prayer
Teach us to love as you love
This is a mother's, a father's prayer

Melissa McClelland,"1, 2, 1, 2, yo check this out, it's the jump off right now
I want everybody, to put your work down, put your guns down
And report to the pit, the gravel pit
Leave your problems at home, leave your children at home
We gon' take it back underground, I be Bobby Boulders
Wu-tang Clan on yo' mind one time
It's the jump off, so just jump off my nigga

Check out my gravel pit
A mystery unraveling
Wu-tang is the CD that I travel with
Don't go against the grain if you can't handle it

Ha, holocaust from the land of the lost
Behold the pale horse, off course (off course)
Follow me, Wu-Tang gotta be
The best thing since Starks and Clark Wallabees
African killer bees blackwatch
On your radio, blowin out yo' watts
From Park Hill, the house on haunted hill
Every time you walk by your back get a chill
Let's peel, who want to talk rap skills
I spit like a semi-automatic to the grill
Elbow grease, and elbow room
Baby play me, baby fall down, go boom
Party people gather round, count down to apocalypse
(I'm the kid with the golden arms)
And I'm the motherfuckin hott nikks pass the blunt
My nigga don't front
You had it for a minute but it seem like a month
Now I'm chokin, smokin, hopin
I don't croakin, from overdosin
Hey, kid, walk straight, master your high
Wu and Meth got you open (open), let's ride
Can't stand niggas that floss too much
Can't stand Bentleys they cost too much
Kid wanna get up then kid get touched
Kid wanna stick up then kid get stuck
I'm the one that called your bluff
When your boy tried to act tough
Remember what Ol' Dirty said: ""I'll fuck yo' ass up!""
Now listen

Back, back and forth and forth

E with the English, extinguish styles extremist
Bald head beamers run wild
It's the kid with the gold cup
Stepped out like what
What's poppin, and y'all niggas dobo
Blastin shae shae, chocolate shortae
Rich color mocks, rock those all day
1960 shit I'm Goldie
That's right motherfucker don't hold me
The world's greatest, Las Vegas, paid as rock
Skin painted on my face look ageless
Perfect combos, Ghost bang out condos
Jeff from Hamo, ex three bangos
Bancos, stank hoes in plain clothes
Change those, bang those, same old, same old

Yeah y'all, straight up this the jump off right here
The gravel pit, word up represent, rock the boulders
All my rich gangsta style, killers, y'all know what time it is
Shorty do your thing, get up on that shit right now boo, do you
That's what I'm talkin 'bout

Yo, step to my groove, move like this
When we shoot the gift of course it's ruthless
Grab the mic with no excuses
In a sec, grab the Tecs and loot this
Executing, shaking all sets, and I'm breaking all hecks
I'm taking all bets, move all best, who want the dram' next
You all stank, we got the bigger bank
Bigger shank to fill your tank
Still the same kill you for real, while you crank
Slide, do or die, fry to bake
Admire the greats, on fire wit a heart of hate
Bitter shark, every part I take, heavy darts that quake
It's okay, all fakes, get caught by the dropkicks
You know the thrill, yes it's Park Hill
Yo we hit 'em with the hot grits
On the go, check the flow, saying Wu don't rock shit
Stop quick, hold the gossip, stop sweating my pockets
I hear the hot shit

Check out my gravel pit
A mystery unraveling
Wu-tang is the CD that I travel with
Don't go against the grain if you can't handle it
You don't have to move a mountain
Just give me enough strength to climb
Oh Lord ! Don't take away my stumbling vows
And lead me a round

Yakub, maker and creator of the devil
Swine merchant your time is near at hand
Fuck with me and your time will be now
Your presence here effects the mind of my people like a fever

And fixes all your big mistakes. 
And when she goes and breaks your heart 
I get your call. You fall apart.

Petite fille ordinaire
Des peurs secrètes

Au creux de tes bras

Tu vois j’avais tout

Et ma force pour tenir debout

Et moi j’étais prête
A affronter la vie
Et les soucis
Crois-moi

Et depuis j’ai appris à vivre sans toi
Et t’es parti
J’ai séché mes larmes et j’ai grandi sans toi
Et t’es parti
Sans te retourner, sans dire pourquoi 
Et t’es parti, t’es parti, t’es parti sans moi

Première connerie
Depuis que tu as
Refait ta vie

J’n’étais qu’une fillette
Parmi tant d’autres
Moi aux oubliettes
Mais est-ce ma faute ?

J’ai fait du chemin
J’ai vu l’horizon
Et j’ai touché du doigt le pardon
J’étais sur le point
De faire de ma vie

I'm a quirky girl in an offbeat world
I'm up close and personal
I do the weirdest things
I'm not too shy to sing
So, la la la la la la
Got my own things that give me style
No warranty, can you handle that?
Cause you know you can't take me back

[Chorus:]
I was trying to be myself 
All you want is someone else 
An unoriginal girl 
What you get is what you see
All you're gonna get from me
Is an original girl

I think you watch too much TV
Cause you got no idea what a girl's supposed to be
And I'm gunna be myself

I was trying to be myself 
All you want is someone else 
An unoriginal girl 
What you get is what you see
All you're gonna get from me

Melissa O'Neil,"Tell me what are you hiding, under the stairs
Tell me what's in your closet, what's got you scared
Cause I've come so far, to know who you are
And you always leave me waiting

[Chorus]
I'm so tired of standin' here at your door
It's not what I wanted I want more
I wish I knew what was inside but I've always been
On the outside looking in

Feels like I've know you forever but what do I know
You never answer my questions, only the door
So I wait for you to show me who
You are, but I'm still waitin'

Do your secrets keep you warm at night or do they keep you lonely?
Do the brick walls keep you safe from hammer, is that why you won't get to know me?

That it has been hard for you
It must be killing you
And I can feel
How it pulls at you
It pulls at me too
I would run away to the world I lef behind
I will find away back to you

And when you've got no where to turn
And you're all alone
When your walls a breaking yet there's no escaping 
And I, I'd fly through the night
To get back to your side
I will be your safe place to hide

I was, always there for you
Always cared for you
And I'm still
Right here guarding you
Watching over you

Though I'm miles away
From the world I left behind
I will find a way back to you

And when you've got no where to turn
And you're all alone
When your walls a breaking yet there's no escaping 
And I, I'd fly through the night

I'll be there by your side
The safe place that you hide cause nothings really changing
I'm just a few more miles away

And when you've got no where to turn
And you're all alone

Yet there's no escaping and

Melissa O'Neil,"I took my chances 
I knew that you were trouble 
But you're like a magnet 
When you get closer, you pull me on
You said, we'll never go wrong 
A promise you can't keep 
Today, my memory's so long 
Long gone (could it be that) 

I'm better off, on my own 
Then you kick and you scream and you break me

But I'm finally tryin' to stake my claim with you 
I'm so tired of holdin' on 
When you string me along 

I might get stuck in 
This tangled web you're weavin' 
I'm like your puppet 
But you're strangling' my breathin' 
You said be patient with me 
To be honest, I can't hang 
Today these chains don't fit me and 
I'm not gonna play in your game (could it be that)

Melissa O'Neil,"She put him out like the burning end of a midnight cigarette
She broke his heart
Spent his whole life trying to forget
We watched him drink his pain away 
A little at a time
But he never could get drunk enough to get her off his mind
Until the night

He put that bottle to his head
And pulled the trigger
And finally drank away her memory
Life is short, but this time it was bigger
Than the strength he had to get up off his knees
They found him with his face down in the pillow
With a note that said 'I'll love her 'til I die'
And when we buried him beneath the willow
The angels sang a whiskey lullaby

Echo through your eyes

Nothing left for me to say anyway

Would it be easier just to say goodbye

Melissa Quade,"My life has been a tapestry of rich and royal hue,
An everlasting vision of the ever-changing view.
A wondrous woven magic in bits of blue and gold
A tapestry to feel and see, impossible to hold.

Once, amid the soft, silver sadness in the sky,
There came a man of fortune, a drifter passing by.
He wore a torn and tattered cloth around his leathered hide,
And a coat of many colors, yellow, green on either side.

He moved with some uncertainty, as if he didn't know
Just what he was there for, or where he ought to go.
Once he reached for something golden, hanging from a tree,
And his hand came down empty.

Soon within my tapestry, along the rutted road,
He sat down on a river rock and turned into a toad.
It seemed that he had fallen into someone's wicked spell,
And I wept to see him suffer, though I didn't know him well.

As I watched in sorrow, there suddenly appeared
A figure, gray and ghostly, beneath a flowing beard.
In times of deepest darkness, I've seen him dressed in black.
Now my tapestry's unraveling; he's come to take me back.
He's come to take me back.
",Tapestry,2002
Melissa Rapp,"I got kicked off Noah's Ark
I turn my cheek to unkind remarks
There was two of everything

I held my breath and I stood my ground
And I watched that ship go sailing
Out to sea.

[Chorus]
Take it back
Take it back
Oh no, you can't say that
All of my friends
Are not dead or in jail
Through rock and through stone
The black wind still moans
Sweet revenge
Sweet revenge
Without fail.

I caught an isle seat on a plane
And drove an English teacher half insane
Making up jokes about bicycle spokes
And red balloons
So I called up my local deejay
And he didn't have a lot to say
But the radio
Has learned all of my favourite tunes.

[Chorus]

The white meat is on the run
And the dark meat is far too done
And the milkman left me a note yesterday
Get out of this town by noon
You're coming on way too soon
And besides that
We never liked you any way.

with a kind of lovin',
I never will forget, the way she called me sweet daddy"" 
Twas just a beautiful dream
 
I hate to think that it's all over I lost my heart  it seems
I got so used to her somehow
But I'm no body's baby 
Now, gee it's awful when you're lonesome 
and get those lovesick blue-oo-oo-oo-oo's 
 
Got the feeling called the ""blue hoo's,"" 
since my sweetie said ""Good Bye""
Seems I don't know what to ""Do Hoo""
All day long I sit and cry

I'm yearning for it yet

Melissa Swift-Sawyer,"Deep within my heart lies a melody
A song of old San Antone
Where in dreams I live with a memory
Beneath the stars all alone
It was there I found beside the Alamo
Enchantment strange as the blue up above
A moonlit pass that only she would know
Still hears my broken song of love
Moon in all your splendor know only my heart
Call back my rose, rose of San Antone
Lips so sweet and tender like petals falling apart
Speak once again of my love, my own.
Broken song, empty words I know
Still live in my heart all alone
For that moonlit pass by the Alamo
And Rose, my Rose of San Antone
Deep within my heart lies a melody,
A song of old San Antone
Where in dreams I live with a memory
Beneath the stars all alone
It was there I found beside the Alamo
Enchantment strange as the blue up above
A moonlit pass that only she would know
Still hears my broken song of love
Moon in all your splendor know only my heart

We might be lovers if the rhythm's right

Last night I dreamt of San Pedro
Just like I'd never gone, I knew the song
A young girl with eyes like the desert
It all seems like yesterday, not far away

Tropical the island breeze
All of nature wild and free
This is where I long to be

And when the samba played
The sun would set so high
Ring through my ears and sting my eyes
Your Spanish lullaby

I fell in love with San Pedro
Warm wind carried on the sea, he called to me
Te dijo te amo
I prayed that the days would last
They went so fast

All of nature wild and free
This is where I long to be
La isla bonita
And when the samba played
The sun would set so high
Ring through my ears and sting my eyes

I want to be where the sun warms the sky
When it's time for siesta you can watch them go by
Beautiful faces, no cares in this world
Where a girl loves a boy, and a boy loves a girl

Last night I dreamt of San Pedro
It all seems like yesterday, not far away

You abandoned me

Could you see my tears
When I turned the other way
Did you hear me say
I'd wait for all the dark clouds bursting in a perfect sky
You promised me when you said goodbye
That you'd return when the storm was done
And now I'll wait for the light, I'll wait for the sun

Waiting is the hardest thing
I tell myself that if I believe in you
In the dream of you
With all my heart and all my soul
That by sheer force of will
I will raise you from the ground
And without a sound you'll appear
And surrender to me
To love

Pleurer dans nos ville, nos sarcasmes

Aux armes aux armes

Que veut cette horde de militaires
De traîtres et de rois conjurés?
Pour qu'ils nous prennent, quand ils nous traitent
De cons, de braves, de pauvres français!

Feraient la lois dans nos foyer?
Quoi? Nos flics, soldats, mercenaires,
Alors qu'on est tous étrangers !

Pas de droits sans devoirs dit elles

Si peu si bien qu’j’m’abandonne je veux que tu m’viennes cet automne
Viens viens viens là viens moi et promets moi 
Viens et puis sers moi contre toi dis moi que tu t’abandonnes",Viens,2011
Melissmell,"A chacun son chemin, la liberté se jette
Au delta, au-delà, où l'océan reflète
On dit que tout est grand à y perdre la tête
On y goûte un instant et dedans tout s'émiette

J'ai choisi mon chemin, ma liberté, ma quête
Je ne m'en fais pas pour moi, mais les brebis m'inquiètent
Ici bas, elles se gavent de ferraille, de plastique,
D'arbres, de betteraves et d'amours synthétiques

Devant ce grand festin, la liberté regrette
Les brebis ont vomis, l'indigestion les guette
Qu'y a-t-il donc après? Plus rien
Les brebis sont tentées par les sentiers divins

Crapahuter là-haut pendant les transhumances
Dans l'auberge, il fait chaud, elles remplissaient leur panse
De sermons asservis sans une prière et au lit sans

Sans s'inquiéter du temps, sans redouter l'errance
Le pasteur rabâchant ses conseils de prudence
Mettez-vous ça dans la tête, les brebis ne sont pas faites

Pour apprécier le large, pour apprendre à voler
Gambader dans les marges, aimer la liberté
Tôt ou tard, tout penaud, on rejoint le troupeau

A chacun son chemin, la liberté se jette
Au delta, au-delà, où l'océan reflète
On dit que tout est grand à y perdre la tête
On y goûte un instant et dedans tout s'émiette

J'ai choisi mon chemin, ma liberté, ma quête
Je ne m'en fais pas pour moi, mais les brebis m'inquiètent
Ici bas, elles se gavent du premier fanatique,
Le vent, le sourcil grave, ou le doigt prophétique

Je ne m'en fais pas pour moi, mais les brebis m'inquiètent
On les a déjà vues foncer à l'aveuglette,
Quand elles ont peur de tout, droit dans la gueule du loup

Lalalalalalalala
Quand elles ont peur de tout, droit dans la gueule du loup
Quand elles ont peur de tout, droit dans la gueule du loup
Quand elles ont peur de tout, droit dans la gueule du loup",Les Brebis,2013
Melissmell,"Quand la colère vous mord, que commence
La transhumance au bord, au bord
Elle s’amuse, elle dévore, bientôt tu ne seras
Plus qu’un tas de remords, si elle s’accroche à toi

Je sais de quoi je parle, je sais de quoi je parle

De figures de romans en chevauchées sans fin
On se bat pour ne pas qu’elle engloutisse en vain
Les grands sages ont bien dit, la faute est capitale
On ne la prend pour guide la colère comme étoile

Je sais de quoi je parle, je sais de quoi je parle
Quand elle prend le contrôle, inverse les rôles et fait trembler ma voix
Elle rend, la colère, la douceur amère, elle ronge sa proie
Oh combien de temps faudra-t-il avant qu’elle ouvre la voie ?

Qu’elle ouvre la voie…oh mon amour, pardonne moi

Dans les moindres recoins, dans les contrées immenses
Elle retrouve un fuyard à sa traînée d’essence
Rien ne sert de courir, adieu mon innocence
Il me faudra choisir, elle ou bien le silence
Je sais de quoi je parle, je sais de quoi je parle

Quand elle prend le contrôle, inverse les rôles et fait trembler ma voix
Elle rend, la colère, la douceur amère, elle ronge sa proie

Melissmell,"J'en suis sûre c'est comme ça, la musique ne dit pas
La musique ne dit pas, elle le frappe et c'est tout
J'en suis sûre, c'est comme ça, la musique ne pense pas 
La musique est une onde, un pulseur dans le coup

Quand les filles dans la transe, je les sens sans tabous
Les tympans sans défense soumis au garde à vous

Devant moi le dancefloor comme une fleur s'est offert
J'en ai fait ma maison, j'en ai fait mon repère
J'avais juste quinze ans et du son dans la tête
Je pouvais être un roi sous ma boule à facettes

Mais elle restait dehors mon âme torturée
Ça parlait à mon corps, ça chassait les idées

Ça parlait à mon corps, ça chassait les idées
Mais elle restait dehors mon âme torturée

J'en suis sûre c'est comme ça, la musique ne dit pas
La musique ne dit pas, elle te frappe et c'est tout
J'en suis sûre c'est comme ça, peu importe où tu vas
Elle au moins elle, elle te suivra partout

Un jour j'ai du partir à l'autre bout du monde
Il faut savoir s'enfuir quand le tonnerre vous gronde

Dans les eaux de la Rouge, où le Yémen en face
Là, j'ai connu des frères, là, j'ai perdu ma trace
J'oubliais mon amant, j'oubliais la musique
Mais sa douce voix la nuit venait jusqu'en Afrique

Là-bas sans conditions elle seule m'avait suivi
A réfléchir, la seule qui n'a jamais trahi

Après, j'ai pris la mer et je suis revenue
Droit dans la fourmilière de Paris la vendue
Là-bas, les hommes se mentent en courant très très vite
Elle tient quand même debout, tout est question de rythme

Mon ami, la musique, j'en ai vu les viscères
J'en ai serré des mains, j'en ai levé des verres

Mon ami, la musique, j'en ai vu les viscères
J'en ai serré des mains, j'en ai levé des verres

Aujourd'hui j'en suis là, sans savoir où je vais
On m'a menti cent fois et tout est compliqué
Et lui qui vient me dire il faut monter au front
La musique est une arme, les mots ses munitions

Laisse moi mon refuge, laisse la qu'elle réponde
La musique était vierge ne va pas la salir
Laisse la la musique, laisse la qu'elle respire
La musique était vierge, ne va pas la salir",La Crapule,2013

Demain, je prends la route
avant l'aube des fusillés

Entre les prétendants
Prêt à mourir pour des idées,
Et ceux qui déjà mort
N'y ont jamais vraiment pensés

Je t'écris cette lettre

Je t'écris cette lettre,
De la frontière qui nous sépare
A cloche pieds sur la crête
Entre ton ombre et mon devoir

Le soleil est bien là mais hésite à chauffer
Faut dire que d'où on vient la légende disait
Que ça ne sert à rien d'attendre et d'espérer

Ce matin le printemps nous fait vieillir je sais
La vie est un peu brève, et nos têtes brouillées
Quelques années à jouir, quelques autres à pleurer
Des années à chercher un peu de vérité

Il faudrait qu'on en vive avant que d'en crever
Un baiser de tes lèvres là sur mes yeux mouillés
Un regard plein de fièvre, un peu de ta fierté
Suffirait à donner dix ans de liberté

Ce matin le printemps est voilé par l'orage
Même dans la part du sombre la cupide est volage
Le jour prête à se fondre, elle reste en embuscade
Et fait passé son ombre pour la vertu du sage

Il faudrait qu'on la sème avant qu'elle est bouffée
L'enfance par la sève, la face dévoilée
Il faudrait qu'on la sème avant que de tomber
Sous les coups qu'est la scène, les assauts répétés

Ce matin le printemps à peine à 'imposer
Le soleil est bien là mais hésite à chauffer
Faut dire que d'où on vient la légende disait
Que ça ne set à rien d'attendre et d'espérer

Il faudrait qu'il allume un feu de joie sur le pavé

Melissmell,"Je la vois couler sur ta joue
Et emprisonner la lumière
Elle chante comme chanteraient les fous
Bien trop brillante pour être amère
Elle pèse des tonnes de ce temps-là
Des vents que nous laissons derrière
Elle en libère des au-delà
Dont le glas ne sonnera pas

La larme sonne la faim
La dévorante envie de plaire
La larme appelle enfin l'étreinte
Et ne ferme plus les paupières
Elle n'a qu'à suivre le sillon
Des flots, des ruisseaux, des rivières
Que tu creusais dans tes nuits blanches
Espérant rejoindre la mer

Que dans ce monde on lui jouera
De nombreux tours pour arriver
Certains prendront de l'eau de pluie
Après l'avoir un peu salée
La vendront pour de l'eau bénite

Puis, puis ils viendront chialer
Chialer sur leur vie sans mérite
Tirer leurs poils de nez
Pour rendre une larme authentique
Une fois arrivés
Voler aux autres leur histoire
Et les laisser crever
Sans daigner leur tendre un mouchoir

Listen to my talk and get up, I'm on the corner with my

Hey kids, gather around, it's Wyclef and Melky Sedeck
I got a story to tell, here we go

Sit right back and hear a tale of a hustler 'round my way
He used to clock around the block from where my grandma stayed
Black BMW with rims to match, windows bulletproof
One night, he jumped out the car
And caught a bullet in his bubblegoose
He caught a bullet in his bubblegoose
He caught a bullet in his bubblegoose
You can be at the party gettin' loose
But you can catch a bullet in your bubblegoose

Hey yo, hey yo, my pen's in my hand, OK, what should I write next?
Oh yeah, and if you don't know, success brings stress
I'm vexed, my phone rings, collect caller from Jeff
The operator say, ""If you accept, say yes""
""Yes, what's the deal, son?""
""Yo, I got bad news""
Yo, by the tone of his voice, I heard the I'll street blues
""The friends will make you, them too can break you
They plan an execution like Fu Manchu""
""Who?""
""You know the character from channel 5 kung-fu (wahoo)""
""Slow down, man, Jeff, I'm losin' you""
""Hey yo, your cousin Rohann...""
""Uh-huh""
""Who used to sell bang""
""Uh-huh""
""DT's found his hand in the back of Bennigans""
""What?""
""In a plastic bag with a note attached""
""Saying what?""
""A million and a half or he won't be back""
""So meet me by the Brooklyn Bridge, 12:00 sharp""
""If not, at the funeral, you gotta play the harp""
Yo, why they wanna start and make me play my part?
Don't they know like Sting, I can turn this murder into art?
I jumped into my car, there's gotta be a joke
Traffic's backed up, who's in town, the Pope?
S-s-s-s-someone blew the horn, I turned and looked left
To my surprise, it was my sis, Melky Sedeck

You're shootin' in the opposite position
I'm thinkin', ""Should I fire or hold back on ammunition
On your wig transition?""
My mission, like Take 6, is to spread love
But all you screwed mugs got me wearin' black gloves
You up in my face, I see the fear in your eyes
You gonna feel the pain like a grown man gettin' circumcised

But my right hand's on your throat, massaging you to death
You provoke the cycle, call Michael
You're lookin' in the mirror, well, I'm in your window, oh oh
You hear me Urkel, your blood will turn purple
Like the color, you holler, bawlin' for your mother
No-one hears you even though you knock

Now you got your knot wocked with your very own Glock

You told me you'd be mine forever
I am the lady from New York
Whose heart you once broke
On a night like tonight

Can you imagine how it felt?
Did you even feel any guilt?
(Oh well, oh well, oh well)
Your tender touch will set me free
When you wrap me in you arms and say that you love me (oh yes)
It gives me the strength to move on
In your loving arms I'm never alone
(Alone, alone)

On a lonely night in Brooklyn
When all hope was long gone and shattered
You were the sun that shined on me
And it was your love that set me free
Honestly, you complete me, yes
Even if I lived a thousand years (uh-huh)
I'd always need you close and near (oh well, oh well, oh well)
Your tender touch set me free
When you wrap me in your arms and say
That you love me, yes
It gives me the strength to move on (and on and on and on)
In your loving arms I'm never alone (alone, alone)

Melky Sedeck,"Yo this is the Rock kicking it with the Refugee camp
And you're bout to smell what the Rock is cookin'

Yo this is strictly a club record
Dedicated to everybody who used to stand outside in the cold
When the F-L-E-X was spinnin at the Red Zone, hooded down
And these tired bouncers would not let me in
YouknowwhatI'msayin?

Yo, yo, yo
I got fifty Bentley's in the West Indies
(It doesn't matter!)
I got a pocket full of cheese and a garden full of trees
(It doesn't matter!)
I just won the bingo bought a crib in Rio
(It doesn't matter!)
Cause if you ain't sharin, people ain't carin
Come up in the hood and they take everything you wearin

Back in the days it was all about the clubs
And the so-called thugs used to dance the break for love
The girls, they wouldn't say HEY!
Unless you bought 'em champagne like it was they birthday
Me, I used to stand outside
Hustlin my way in I'm on the guest list plus five!
Who's performin tonight?  He said Shabba
Mister Lover Daddy he be the selector
(Stop drop the Rock's up in here)
Disrespect emcees and catch a smack in your left ear
Light up like Vegas when it's time to gamble
Girls scream for me like I was part of the Beatles
But I'm not honey, but I could be your Paul McCartney
and ""Ebony or Ivory"" into my Jacuzzi
Foundation like Kool Herc, or DJ Red Alert goes bezerk
The needle ain't skip the record jerked
Cause y'all jumpin' too hard
(Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!)

I got fifty Bentley's in the West Indies

Yo cause if you ain't sharin, people ain't carin
Come up in the hood and they take everything you wearin
Yo Rock I just bought a fresh Bentley
(It doesn't matter you just bought a fresh Bentley!)

How many of y'all ever been to a barbecue
And you always got an aunt or uncle
wanna show you how the old dances go
And they start it off like this
Electric slide on the dance floor
Freaky-deaky like Studio 54
GIRLS!! Until the IRS raids it
Drug money get converted into music
The dope man becomes an entertainer
Leave that crack alone! I told the customers
I'm into bigger and better things Mr. Fiend
You want a hit? Give me a guitar and a drum machine
And the crowd will scream loud when the bass thump
I can smell it in the air, the smell is funk
Excuse me I gotta cough
Girl you wearin' so much ice you could freeze New York
You're man must really love you, what does he do for a living?
(He works on Wall Street he's only home two nights a week)
That's when she said a little too much conversation
Think she want to indulge in lyrical masturbation
So I proceeded with the conversation, I said
Can I offer you a glass of Merlot Mrs. No Name?
(Let's get it straight huh, my name's Veronica)
She had the ass the size of South America
She said ain't you that kid that sing Guantanamera
way before Ricky Martin sung ""Livin' La Vida Loca""
What hood you come from?
I was raised in Brooklyn, but did my studies in Jerusalem
The New Jerusalem yup, that's short for New Jersey
Checked my watch it was a quarter to three
Slid to her crib when we opened the door
Her man was on the bottle waiting for her with the 44

Now what it look like, it ain't really that
(It doesn't matter!)
So he cocked the gat at my top hat
(It doesn't matter!)
Are you crazy? You was married!
(It doesn't matter!)
Cause if you ain't sharin, people ain't carin
Come up in your hood and they take everything you wearin

Yeah that's when shorty walked up to her man
And she said I gotta go I can't be here no more
And she said this

Take me home, to the place
I belong at the Refugee Camp
And the Booga basement
That's where I live, oh

Come on
Yo Rock I sold like seventeen million records
(It doesn't matter how many records you've sold!)
Alright I'm with you, yo check it out
You wanna go get diamond rings?

Salesman's like what up, what's your budget?
And I'm like honestly, I don't know nothing about Mopeds
He said I got the one for you, follow me
Ooh, it's too real
Chromed out mirror, I don't need a windshield
Banana seat, a canopy on two wheels
Eight hundred cash, that's a hell of a deal

I'm headed downtown, cruising through the alley
Tip-toeing in the street like Dally
Pulled up, moped to the valley
Whitewalls on the wheels like mayonnaise
Dope, my crew is ill, and all we need is two good wheels
Got gas in the tank, cash in the bank
And a bad little mama with her ass in my face
I'mma lick that, stick that, break her off, Kit-Kat
Snuck her in backstage, you don't need a wristband

Killing the game, 'bout to catch a body
Passed the Harley, Dukie on the Ducati
Timbaland, Khaled, Scott Storch, Birdman
God damn, man, everybody got Bugattis

Head into the dealership and drop a stack and cop a Kawasaki
I'm stunting on everybody, hella raw, pass the Wasabi
I'm so low that my scrotum's almost dragging up on the concrete
My seat is leather, alright, I'm lying, it's pleather
But girl, we could still ride together
You don't need a Uber, you don't need a cab
Fuck a bus pass, you got a Moped man

'Cause I'm too damn quick, I'm too damn slick
Whole downtown yelling out who that is?

Sounding like a French pimp from back in the day
I take her to Pend Oreille and I watch her skate
I mean, water ski, ollie ollie oxen free
I'm perusing down fourth and they watching me
I do a handstand, the eagle lands on my seat
Well hello, but baby, the kickstand ain't free
Now do you or do you not wanna ride with me

She a big girl, that ain't a big deal

Going down the backstreet listening to Blackstreet
Running around the whole town
Neighbors yelling at me like, you need to slow down
Going thirty-eight, Dan, chill the fuck out
Mow your damn lawn and sit the hell down
If I only had one helmet I would give it to you, give it to you
Cruising down Broadway, girl, what a wonderful view, wonderful view
There's layers to this shit player, tiramisu, tiramisu

It's like a jungle sometimes, it makes me wonder how I keep from goin' under

Broken glass everywhere
People pissin' on the stairs, you know they just don't care
I can't take the smell, can't take the noise
Got no money to move out, I guess I got no choice
Rats in the front room, roaches in the back
Junkies in the alley with a baseball bat
I tried to get away but I couldn't get far
'Cause a man with a tow truck repossessed my car

Don't push me 'cause I'm close to the edge
I'm trying not to lose my head, ha-ha

It's like a jungle sometimes, it makes me wonder how I keep from goin' under

Standin' on the front stoop hangin' out the window
Watchin' all the cars go by, roarin' as the breezes blow
Crazy lady, livin' in a bag
Eatin' outta garbage pails, used to be a fag hag
Said she'll dance the tango, skip the light fandango
A Zircon princess seemed to lost her senses
Down at the peep show watchin' all the creeps
So she can tell her stories to the girls back home
She went to the city and got so-so seditty
She had to get a pimp, she couldn't make it on her own

Don't push me 'cause I'm close to the edge
I'm trying not to lose my head, ha-ha

It's like a jungle sometimes, it makes me wonder how I keep from goin' under

My brother's doin' bad, stole my mother's TV
Says she watches too much, it's just not healthy
All My Children in the daytime, Dallas at night
Can't even see the game or the Sugar Ray fight
The bill collectors, they ring my phone
And scare my wife when I'm not home
Got a bum education, double-digit inflation
Can't take the train to the job, there's a strike at the station
Neon King Kong standin' on my back
Can't stop to turn around, broke my sacroiliac
A mid-range migraine, cancered membrane
Sometimes I think I'm goin' insane
I swear I might hijack a plane

Don't push me 'cause I'm close to the edge
I'm trying not to lose my head

It's like a jungle sometimes, it makes me wonder how I keep from goin' under
It's like a jungle sometimes, it makes me wonder how I keep from goin' under

My son said, Daddy, I don't wanna go to school
'Cause the teacher's a jerk, he must think I'm a fool
And all the kids smoke reefer, I think it'd be cheaper
If I just got a job, learned to be a street sweeper
Or dance to the beat, shuffle my feet
Wear a shirt and tie and run with the creeps
'Cause it's all about money, ain't a damn thing funny
You got to have a con in this land of milk and honey
They pushed that girl in front of the train
Took her to the doctor, sewed her arm on again
Stabbed that man right in his heart
Gave him a transplant for a brand new start
I can't walk through the park 'cause it's crazy after dark
Keep my hand on my gun 'cause they got me on the run
I feel like a outlaw, broke my last glass jaw
Hear them say ""you want some more?""
Livin' on a see-saw

Don't push me 'cause I'm close to the edge
I'm trying not to lose my head, say what?

Blind to the ways of mankind
God is smilin' on you but he's frownin' too
Because only God knows what you'll go through
You'll grow in the ghetto livin' second-rate
And your eyes will sing a song called deep hate
The places you play and where you stay
Looks like one great big alleyway
You'll admire all the number-book takers
Thugs, pimps and pushers and the big money-makers
Drivin' big cars, spendin' twenties and tens
And you'll wanna grow up to be just like them
Huh, smugglers, scramblers, burglars, gamblers
Pickpocket peddlers, even panhandlers
You say I'm cool, huh, I'm no fool
But then you wind up droppin' outta high school
Now you're unemployed, all non-void
Walkin' round like you're Pretty Boy Floyd
Turned stick-up kid, but look what you done did
Got sent up for a eight-year bid
Now your manhood is took and you're a Maytag
Spend the next two years as a undercover fag
Bein' used and abused to serve like hell
Till one day, you was found hung dead in the cell
It was plain to see that your life was lost
You was cold and your body swung back and forth
But now your eyes sing the sad, sad song
Of how you lived so fast and died so young

So don't push me 'cause I'm close to the edge

Because rap is the game that I control.

I'm like Shakespeare, I'm a pioneer
Because I made rap somethin' people wanted to hear.
See, before my reign, it was the same old same,
""To the ba with the ba"", that street-talk game,

So if you ever, let me make this clear,
If you ever think that we're steppin' out of here,
You ever think you're gettin' up, down, around or in,
Huh huh, you better think again, my friend

Because the door is closed and we're in town
And the only place you can go is down!

Step, step, step, step, step off.)

Well, I'm Kieth Cowboy and you're my cow,
So what you MC's gonna do now?
It's gonna be a slaughter and here's my plan.
You won't even get bread and butter, my man.

Gonna put you on the racks like a pair of slacks
With another wack rapper tied to your back,
And if you want to hang yourself out to dry,
It's the beautiful round-up in the sky.

I'm the carry-out kid when my trigger's in cock.
I'll be carryin' out bodies stiff as a rock.
Carryin' out a million dollars in my pockets and hand,
But I carry out orders from no man,

'Cause anything you want to do, I already did.
You used to see me rock the house when you was a kid,
But in my MC school, my class is packed
And tricks are for kids so I left your ass back.

The bow-legged brother, there'll never be another.
I buy a mansion for my mother.
The 24/7, the cool-Aid smile,
Say, ""Hey, crack a lemon and look at my pile.""

[Chorus]

Come on.
Now you know just who I am
And what I do because I'm in demand,
Because I look good.

Do you hear, my man?
And if you can't take that, you chump your old hand.
One girl at a time get an MC
So how could you think that you rank with me?

If you only did your homework, you would surely find
When Scorp' get girls, they all be fine
And the only girl that you could take of mine
Is the one that I left way behind

And plus you're cheap, you're petty, your music is trash.
You need to go to the bank and get some cash
Because talkin' don't pay, you're driftin' away.
When I see you on the stage, I'm-a blow you away.

You're right.
There is no diff between me and you
Except I look good and you look through.
Take that.

Step, step, step, step, step off
Because you got to get lost because you know you're soft.

Little pieces of a dream is all you mean
Since the day you stepped into the MC scene.
Bitin' your moves, takin' fake awards,
Sayin' everyone else is perpetratin' the frauds,

But you're nothin' but a clone of a flesh and bone.
Now you're tryin' to play gone on the microphone,
But I tell you 'bout a night and you know I'm right
When you listen to us rockin' to the broad daylight,

And then you looked in the sky and you started to cuss,
But then you prayed to God that you could be like us.
Then God was great and God was true
And he tried to show you how to be like you,

But you still didn't get where you wanted to go
When you gathered in a group and got your own show
'Cause without the source, the force won't survive.
For eternity, the source is alive.

You forgot the words of your creator
And now he's made you a perpetrator, 
Forever in a world of you and a girl,
A few grams in a pipe to make your head swirl.

You must spread the words of the master teacher.
You die by the rhymes and the streets'll eat you.
The words are a gift we will never flaunt.
That's why we're gonna get everything we want.

Just like a shadow in the night on a sight unseen
And I'm the bonafide vocal master supreme,
And I'm here to run it down for the ladies and gents
For my rhymes make dollars plus they make sense,

See, you're down with Cowboy, you'll be rockin' the show.
With King Lu, Tommy Gun and, huh, Scorpio,
Kamikaze Clayton Savage and Easy Mike
And goin' down in the books is the king of the night,

So if you're ever in a battle, I'm-a make you my slave
And I'm-a give you a shovel so you can dig a grave.
Leave behind all your fame and wealth
So you can say one rhyme, then bury yourself, huh.

I may sound possessed, but you know I'm blessed
With the will to make sense of all this mess.
I'm the power of the sun that shines in the sky
And I'm the only MC that'll never die,

So just rock and don't stop 'til you hit the top,
But when you see Mellie Mel, you're gonna have to drop.

And not only that,

Step, step, step, step, step off
Because you got to get lost because you know you're soft, uh-huh.
Step, step, step, step, step off
Because you got to get lost because you know you're soft, uh-huh-huh.

And for all you MC's, you heard my story
On my super-fly, cold-crushin' fame and glory,
How I rocked the children and the young ladies.
I even rocked the country that was overseas

'Cause I can rock anybody from any crew.
Because I did it to Chaka, I'm-a do it to you.
I'm-a show you how I rocked it, why'all, all night long,
But when I rocked with Chaka Khan, I just said,

""Chaka Khan, let me rock you, let me rock you, Chaka Khan."", I said, 
""Let me rock you, that's all I want to do. 
Chaka Khan, let me rock you, let me rock you, Chaka Khan."", I said.
""Let me me rock you 'cause I feel for you.

Chaka Khan, won't you tell me what you want to do?
Do you feel for me the way I feel for you.
Chaka Khan, let me tell you what I want to do.
I want to love you, want to hug you, want to squeeze you too,

So let me take me in your arms, let me fill you with my charms, Chaka
'Cause you know that I'm the one to keep you warm, Chaka.
I'll make you more than just a physical spell.
I want to rock you, Chaka baby, 'cause my name is Mellie Mel.""

Say what, why'all.
Say what.

He got out three years from now just to commit more crime
A businessman is caught with twenty four kilos

Crime, it pays real nice
But what you really didn't know that crime pays twice
It pays once in money, twice in years

Turned out to be another dirty old broad

He loves his honey, but she loved money

The mob, a full time job
Known to extort and steal or rob
Started as a hitman, lookin for wealth
And now he's the boss workin for his self
For all the blood money that he did earn
It made him take lives with no concern
But soon he would learn that next is his turn

Prostitution, it's a low down shame
How any girl, would want to play that game
From pillow, to post, a sidewalk host
But the lady's got a condo out on the coast
She thought that the hole, was better than gold
Now she worked on her back til she got too old
Layin down on the job, has made her a slob, uhh

Take all the fingerprints, and give him the book
And then hope that the judge don't let him off the hook, uh!

Melle Mel,"Come on, I said come on, I said come on

Rappers might be willin but they ain't able
Cause I was their king straight from my cradle
I screamed and hollered and shook my rattle
And dreamt of defeating them all in battle

There was no food in my silver spoon
So I grew up hard and I grew up soon
I'm a righteous king but I'm hungry too
And I eat up chumps that rap like you

Then I met this shark and his name was Jaws
He was biting my rhymes like y'all bite yours
I starting writing my rhymes the shark grew and grew
But I was writing more rhymes than the shark could chew 

The shark got sick and then he exploded 
Cause he didn't realize that my rhymes was loaded
They flew in the air and into the sea
And the whole universe knew that the king was me

Come on, I said come on, I said come on

I'm not a laser beam or a diamond mine
Or a platinum watch or some vintage wine 
Not a pocket full of pearls I'm a oil well
Like black gold baby I'm Melle Mel

And to all the fly girls I come off hard 
The slightest wink or nod makes me your god
All my problems are small so my pockets are large
When I walk in the door Oh baby I'm in charge 

Treat ladies like jewels and diamond rings
On my fingers on my arms on everything
On the streets oh my Jesus! I can't be beat 
So don't ask where's the beef baby here is the meat

I'm gonna give you some soap a towel and a cup 
Cause the bum emcees are all washed up
Put your women on the line with the rest of my crew
So I can make love to her and annihilate you

Pump, pump ( me up!) me what? (me up!)
Pump, pump, pump, pump me up!

I'm like the genie in your lamp
A face on your stamp
The hip hop rocker 
The microphone champ

Got a knock out voice
Like a Rolls Royce 
Gotta rank as number one 
To be the people's choice 

Cause you can hum a ding then you can hum a dong
Its just like the friendly game of ping pong
When you hitting the ball upside the paddle 
It's just like cowboy riding on a saddle 

Up above your head is the flash of light 
Cause I can rock to the beat on any God given night
Like to rock like to roll like to entertain 
While my car's outside you're waiting for the train

The train to the bus the bus to whatever 
And I'm the type of MC to rock in any type of weather 
I'm the bow legged brother there'll never be another
I bought a mansion for my mother

Come on, I said come on, I said come on

I got a certain cool that breaks the rules
That get me paid and a lot of jewels
And the women I'm calling day and night 
That's proof I'm getting mine like a thief in the night

Because Scorp is known as the singer
The quiet storm that lover didn't linger
I will not change cause its in my blood 
I'm like dynamite and you a rappin dud

And if the future is here in the making
Then why I can't be part of the taking
Cause you know I like cars and fancy women 
That give me good love in the beginning 

Bubble bath and candle lights 
And girls saying Scorp you alright? 
So stop standing there
I'm not a laser beam or a diamond mine
Or a platinum watch or some vintage wine 
Not a pocket full of pearls I'm a oil well
Like black gold baby I'm Melle Mel

You know that is free as the love you have 
Where does it end It's too much for me to take 
There's no peace, you close your eyes
I'm all out of truth, I'm outta alibis 
Where does it end 
It's too much for me to take

We're gonna love one another 'til morning comes

I know that I could never love any other man 
One of these days you'll understand 
Understand

And his face his heaven sent 
He makes me believe there must be something else 
Where does it end It's too much for me to take
I can feel the need in you 
There isn't a thing, I want you do 
Where does it end It's too much for me to take

It makes me wonder how I keep from goin' under

It's like a jungle sometimes
It makes me wonder how I keep from goin' under

Broken glass everywhere
People pissin' on the stairs, you know they just don't care
I can't take the smell, can't take the noise
Got no money to move out, I guess I got no choice
Rats in the front room, roaches in the back
Junkies in the alley with a baseball bat
I tried to get away but I couldn't get far
''cause a man with a tow truck repossessed my car

Don't push me ''cause I'm close to the edge
I'm trying not to lose my head

It makes me wonder how I keep from goin' under

Standin' on the front stoop hangin' out the window
Watchin' all the cars go by, roarin' as the breezes blow
Crazy lady, livin' in a bag
Eatin' outta garbage pails, used to be a fag hag
Said she'll dance the tango, skip the light fandango
A Zircon princess seemed to lost her senses
Down at the peep show watchin' all the creeps
So she can tell her stories to the girls back home
She went to the city and got so so seditty
She had to get a pimp, she couldn't make it on her own

Says she watches too much, it's just not healthy
'All My Children' in the daytime, 'Dallas' at night
Can't even see the game or the Sugar Ray fight
The bill collectors, they ring my phone
and scare my wife when I'm not home
Got a bum education, double-digit inflation
Can't take the train to the job, there's a strike at the station
Neon King Kong standin' on my back
Can't stop to turn around, broke my sacroiliac
A mid-range migraine, cancered membrane
Sometimes I think I'm goin' insane
I swear I might hijack a plane!

It makes me wonder how I keep from goin' under

It's like a jungle sometimes
It makes me wonder how I keep from goin' under

My son said, Daddy, I don't want to go to school
''cause the teacher's a jerk, he must think I'm a fool
And all the kids smoke reefer, I think it'd be cheaper
if I just got a job, learned to be a street sweeper
Or dance to the beat, shuffle my feet
Wear a shirt and tie and run with the creeps
''cause it's all about money, ain't a damn thing funny
You got to have a con in this land of milk and honey
They pushed that girl in front of the train
Took her to the doctor, sewed her arm on again
Stabbed that man right in his heart
Gave him a transplant for a brand new start
I can't walk through the park ''cause it's crazy after dark
Keep my hand on my gun ''cause they got me on the run
I feel like a outlaw, broke my last glass jaw
Hear them say 'You want some more?'

Blind to the ways of mankind

And your eyes will sing a song called deep hate

Spend the next two years as a undercover fag
Bein' used and abused to serve like hell

It was plain to see that your life was lost
You was cold and your body swung back and forth
But now your eyes sing the sad, sad song
Of how you lived so fast and died so young so...

And everything in New York ain't always what it seems 
You might get fooled if you come from out of town 
But I'm down by law and I know my way around

Too much, too many people, too much (aha-ha) 
Too much, too many people, too much, Raaah!

A castle in the sky, one mile high 
Built to shelter the rich and greedy 
Rows of eyes, disguised as windows 
Looking down on the poor and the needy 
Miles of people, marching up the avenue 
Doin? what they gotta do, just to get by 
I'm living in the land of plenty and many 
But I'm damn sure poor and I don't know why

Too much, too many people, too much

People gather round, said, ""He won't he's just a chump"" 
?Cause he lost his job, then he got robbed 
His mortgage is due and his marriage is through 
He says he ain't gonna pay no child support
Because the bitch left him without a second thought 
He got nothing to eat, no shoes on his feet 
She even left his clothes out in the street 
He keeps hearing noises when he's at home
He always hears voices when he's all alone

But you can't tell the women from the men sometimes 
They're sugar and spice and everything nice 
But when you get ?em home ain't no telling what you find
Right next door is a little old man
I seen him eating dog food out of a can
He says, ""I got to eat, when I can't afford meat 
I barely can stand, on my own two feet
I got a bad habit and I just can't break it 
Something?s on my mind and I just can't shake it 
I need some time, and I want some space 
I gotta get away from the human race?

Too much, too many people, too much (aha-ha) 
Too much, too many people, too much! Raaah!

Staring at a skyscraper reaching into heaven 
When over in the ghetto I'm livin' in hell 
Just play ball or be an entertainer 
'Cause niggaz like me can't read too well
Nobody loves me, nobody cares 
I dreamed about a life but I'm livin' in a nightmare 
Paranoid schizo, set back, snowbound 
Bad news psycho, heart attack, breakdown!

Hee, Huh, Hee, Huh, Hee, Huh, Hee, Huh
Hee, Huh, Hee, Huh, Hee, Huh, Hee, Huh
Hee, Huh, Hee, Huh, Hee, Huh, Hee, Huh
Hee, Huh, Hee, Huh, Hee, Huh, Hee, HUH!

If only I could sleep just ten more minutes 
I might find the strength to make another day 
If I didn't have to get up and do my thing 
I would probably sleep my whole life away
I messed up a nice dream, somethin' bout ice cream 
Whipped cream, fruits and a cherry on top 
Now I gotta get up and face the world, huh 
The pressure is on, It ain't never gonna stop
I sho' gotta learn to use my mind 
I don't want to be kissing nobody's behind 
Just standin' on line lookin' like a jerk 
Gotta get off my butt and do a full day's work
I ran into a pothole, got into a car crash 
Should?a been thinking and tried to fake whiplash 
A crowd gathered round, they're callin' me fat 
Who you lookin' at with a face like that?

New York New York big city of dreams 
Everything in New York ain't always what it seems 
You might get fooled if you come from out of town 
But I'm down by law and I know my way around

On 42nd Street, lookin' for some action 
Women standing on the corner selling satisfaction 
One young punk just leaning on the fence 
Tryin' to make a dollar out of fifteen cents
Really is a prankster, tried to be a gangster 
Real big wheel when a gun is in his hands 
Just did a stick-up, just got picked up 
One dead punk, killed by the man

New York New York big city of dreams 
And everything in New York ain't always what it seem 
You might get fooled if you come from out of town 
But I'm down by law and I know my way around

Too much, too many people, too much (ha ha ha ha) 
Too much, too many people, too much! Huh!

A baby cries and a mother dies 
And the tears fall from the doctor's eyes
Because in this room, on this day 
The Good Lord has giveth, and taketh away, huh!
The gift of life really means a lot 
And in the ghetto your life is all you got 
So you take to the streets, trying to exist 
In the trash and slime of a world like this
What you watch on TV tells you what life is supposed to be 
But when you look outside the only thing you see 
Is the poverty stricken reality, Heh!
Abandoned places, angry faces 
Much hate and hunger throughout the races 
You say, ""I'm grown and I'm on my own 
So why don't everybody just leave me alone!""
Now you stay at home, talking on the phone 
Doin' ninety miles an hour in the fifty mile zone 
They never took the time to tell you ?bout sex 
So you had to learn about it in the discotheques
Nine months later, the baby is there 
And the Nigga that did it said, ""I don't care!"" 
You don't have enough money to help feed two 
So you have to choose between the baby and you
The sky was crying, rain and hail 
When you put your baby in the garbage pail 
Then you kissed the kid and put down the lid 
And you tried to forget what you just did, Huh!
The muffled screams of a dying baby 
Was enough to drive the young mother crazy 
So she ran in the rain trying to ease the pain 
Huh huh, And she drove herself insane

New York New York big city of dreams 
But everything in New York ain't always what it seem 
You might get fooled if you come from out of town 
But I'm down by law and I know my way around

Too much, too many people, too much (haha ha ha) 
Too much, too many people, too much! HUH!

Melle Mel,"It's like a jungle sometimes
It makes me wonder how I keep from goin' under

Broken glass everywhere
People pissin' on the stairs, you know they just don't care
I can't take the smell, can't take the noise
Got no money to move out, I guess I got no choice
Rats in the front room, roaches in the back
Junkies in the alley with a baseball bat
I tried to get away but I couldn't get far
Cause a man with a tow truck repossessed my car

[Chorus]
Don't push me cause I'm close to the edge
I'm trying not to lose my head
It's like a jungle sometimes
It makes me wonder how I keep from goin' under

Standin' on the front stoop hangin' out the window
Watchin' all the cars go by, roarin' as the breezes blow
Crazy lady, livin' in a bag
Eatin' outta garbage pails, used to be a fag hag
Said she'll dance the tango, skip the light fandango
A Zircon princess seemed to lost her senses
Down at the peep show watchin' all the creeps
So she can tell her stories to the girls back home
She went to the city and got so so seditty
She had to get a pimp, she couldn't make it on her own

[Chorus]

It's like a jungle sometimes
It makes me wonder how I keep from goin' under

My brother's doin' bad, stole my mother's TV
Says she watches too much, it's just not healthy
All My Children in the daytime, Dallas at night
Can't even see the game or the Sugar Ray fight
The bill collectors, they ring my phone
And scare my wife when I'm not home
Got a bum education, double-digit inflation
Can't take the train to the job, there's a strike at the station
Neon King Kong standin' on my back
Can't stop to turn around, broke my sacroiliac
A mid-range migraine, cancered membrane
Sometimes I think I'm goin' insane
I swear I might hijack a plane!

[Chorus]

It's like a jungle sometimes
It makes me wonder how I keep from goin' under

My son said, Daddy, I don't wanna go to school
Cause the teacher's a jerk, he must think I'm a fool
And all the kids smoke reefer, I think it'd be cheaper
If I just got a job, learned to be a street sweeper
Or dance to the beat, shuffle my feet
Wear a shirt and tie and run with the creeps
Cause it's all about money, ain't a damn thing funny
You got to have a con in this land of milk and honey
They pushed that girl in front of the train
Took her to the doctor, sewed her arm on again
Stabbed that man right in his heart
Gave him a transplant for a brand new start
I can't walk through the park cause it's crazy after dark
Keep my hand on my gun cause they got me on the run
I feel like a outlaw, broke my last glass jaw
Hear them say ""You want some more?""
Livin' on a see-saw

[Chorus]

It's like a jungle sometimes
It makes me wonder how I keep from goin' under

A child is born with no state of mind
Blind to the ways of mankind
God is smilin' on you but he's frownin' too
Because only God knows what you'll go through
You'll grow in the ghetto livin' second-rate
And your eyes will sing a song called deep hate
The places you play and where you stay
Looks like one great big alleyway
You'll admire all the number-book takers
Thugs, pimps and pushers and the big money-makers
Drivin' big cars, spendin' twenties and tens
And you'll wanna grow up to be just like them, huh
Smugglers, scramblers, burglars, gamblers
Pickpocket peddlers, even panhandlers
You say I'm cool, huh, I'm no fool
But then you wind up droppin' outta high school
Now you're unemployed, all non-void
Walkin' round like you're Pretty Boy Floyd
Turned stick-up kid, but look what you done did
Got sent up for a eight-year bid
Now your manhood is took and you're a Maytag
Spend the next two years as a undercover fag
Bein' used and abused to serve like hell
Til one day, you was found hung dead in the cell
It was plain to see that your life was lost
You was cold and your body swung back and forth
But now your eyes sing the sad, sad song
Of how you lived so fast and died so young so

You wanna die, wear the wrong color rag
I used to walk in stores and yell: ""Lay down!""
You flinch an inch - AK spray down
But I was lucky cause I never caught the hard time
I was blessed with the skill to bust a dope rhyme
All my homies died or caught the penzo
Lost their diamonds, cops towed their Benzos
Livin that life that we thought was it
Fast lanin, but the car flipped
I'm not gonna lie to ya, cause I don't lie
I just kick thick game, some people say: why?
Cause I'm back on the block, I got my life back
So I school the fools about the fast track
I get static from the style of my technique
Profanity, the blatant way in which I speak
But the Dude knows the streets ain't no kiddie game

He told me: ""Ice, keep doin what you're doin, man
Don't give a damn if the squares don't understand
You let em tell you what to say and what to write
Your whole career'll be over by tomorrow night

To dance in France, alone in Rome
On the farmlands of Nebraska, the cold of Alaska
The heat of the motherland
To be with my brotherman
On top of a snowcapped mountain I'm scoutin
What another man saw in a race of people
To see him give his life for the price of equal
The highest wisdoms, the richest kingdoms
The Song of Songs we heard David sing them
He showed me me when I was young and hung out
He showed me makin love, even showed me strung out
He showed me poppin nines, standin on a rock
But tears came to my eyes when he showed me my block

Cause I remember of my people bleedin
Put through slavery and killed for bravery
We shoulda got our freedom much sooner

But now somehow we've learned to earn, to grow, to show
The elevation of a people built is so

Re-create, re-incarnate and re-send

Lies perpetrated as truth, and it left us
Confused, but I've seen it all before

I was sitting on the corner just a wasting my time
When I realised I was the king of the rhyme
I got on the microphone and what do you see huh!
The rest was my legacy
I was born to be the king of the be bop swing
To have Stallions and medallions, big diamond rings
To own a castle and a yacht, two million in gold
'Cause rap is the game that I control
I'm like Shakespeare, I'm a pioneer
Because I made rap something people wanted to hear
See before my reign it was the same old same
You took ""the ba with the ba""
That's street-talk game
So if you ever, let me make this clear
If you ever think that we're stepping out of here
You ever think you're getting up, down, around or in huh huh!
You better think again my friend
Because the door is closed and we're in town
And the only place you can go is down

So what ya M.C's gonna do now?
It's gonna be a slaughter and here's my plan
You won't even get bread and water my man
Gonna put you on the racks like a pair of slacks
With another wack rapper tied to your back
And if you wanna hang yourself out to dry
It's the beautiful round up in the sky
I'm the carry-out kid when my trigger's at cock
I'll be carrying out bodies stiff as a rock
Carrying out a million dollars in my pockets and hand
But I carry out orders from no man
'Cause anything you wanna do I already did
You used to see me rock the house when you was a kid
But in my M.C school, my class was packed
And tricks were for kids so I left your ass back

So how could you think that you rank with me?
If you only did your homework you would surely find
When Scorp get girls, they all be fine
And the only girl that you could take of mine
Is the one that I left way behind
And plus you're cheap, you're petty, your music is trash
You need to go to the bank and get some cash
Because talking don't pay, you're drifting away
When I see you on a stage I'm a blow you away
You're right, there is no difference between me and you
Except I look good and you look Through

Now you trying to play grown on the microphone
But I'll tell ya 'bout a night, and ya know I'm right
When you listen to us rocking to the broad daylight
And then you looked in the sky and you started to cuss
But then you prayed to God that you could be like us
Then God was great and God was true
And he tried to show you how to be like you
But you still didn't get where you wanted to go

'Cause without the source, the force won't survive
For eternity the source is alive
You forgot the words of your creator
And now he's made you a perpertrator
Forever in a world of you and a girl
A few grams in a pipe to make your head swirl
You must spread the word of the master teacher
Or you die by the rhymes and the streets'll eat ya
The words are a gift we will never flaunt
That's why were gonna get everything we want
'Cause like a shadow in the night, I'm the sight unseen
And I'm the bona-fide vocal master supreme
And I'm here to run it down for the ladies and gents
'Cause my rhymes make vowels plus they make sense
See I'm down with Cowboy, you will rock the show
With King Lou, Tommy Gun and huh! Scorpio
Kami-Kazi, Clayton Savage and Easy Mike
And going down in the books is the king of the night
So if you're ever in a battle, I'm a make you my slave
And I'm a give you a shovel so you can dig a grave
Leave behind all your fame and wealth
So you can say one rhyme then bury yourself huh!
I may sound possessed, but you know I'm blessed
With the will to make sense of all this mess
I'm the power of the sun that shines in the sky
And I'm the only M.C that'll never die

See, you're down with Cowboy, you'll be rockin' the show.
With King Lu, Tommy Gun and, huh, Scorpio,
Kamikaze Clayton Savage and Easy Mike
And goin' down in the books is the king of the night,

So if you're ever in a battle, I'm-a make you my slave
And I'm-a give you a shovel so you can dig a grave.
Leave behind all your fame and wealth
So you can say one rhyme, then bury yourself, huh.

I may sound possessed, but you know I'm blessed
With the will to make sense of all this mess.
I'm the power of the sun that shines in the sky
And I'm the only MC that'll never die,

So just rock and don't stop 'til you hit the top,
But when you see Mellie Mel, you're gonna have to drop.

And not only that,

Step, step, step, step, step off
Because you got to get lost because you know you're soft, uh-huh.
Step, step, step, step, step off
Because you got to get lost because you know you're soft, uh-huh-huh.

And for all you MC's, you heard my story
On my super-fly, cold-crushin' fame and glory,
How I rocked the children and the young ladies.
I even rocked the country that was overseas

'Cause I can rock anybody from any crew.
Because I did it to Chaka, I'm-a do it to you.
I'm-a show you how I rocked it, why'all, all night long,
But when I rocked with Chaka Khan, I just said,

""Chaka Khan, let me rock you, let me rock you, Chaka Khan."", I said, 
""Let me rock you, that's all I want to do. 
Chaka Khan, let me rock you, let me rock you, Chaka Khan."", I said.
""Let me me rock you 'cause I feel for you.

Chaka Khan, won't you tell me what you want to do?
Do you feel for me the way I feel for you.
Chaka Khan, let me tell you what I want to do.
I want to love you, want to hug you, want to squeeze you too,

So let me take me in your arms, let me fill you with my charms, Chaka
'Cause you know that I'm the one to keep you warm, Chaka.
I'll make you more than just a physical spell.
I want to rock you, Chaka baby, 'cause my name is Mellie Mel.""

Say what, why'all.
Say what.

To the DJ scratch, the metro match
'Cause we're comin' out fresh with a brand new batch,
So takin' you off into the galaxy

Melle Mel & Duke Bootee,"It's like a jungle sometimes
It makes me wonder how I keep from goin' under

Broken glass everywhere
People pissin' on the stairs, you know they just don't care
I can't take the smell, can't take the noise
Got no money to move out, I guess I got no choice
Rats in the front room, roaches in the back
Junkies in the alley with a baseball bat
I tried to get away but I couldn't get far
Cause a man with a tow truck repossessed my car

[Chorus]
Don't push me cause I'm close to the edge
I'm trying not to lose my head
It's like a jungle sometimes
It makes me wonder how I keep from goin' under

Standin' on the front stoop hangin' out the window
Watchin' all the cars go by, roarin' as the breezes blow
Crazy lady, livin' in a bag
Eatin' outta garbage pails, used to be a fag hag
Said she'll dance the tango, skip the light fandango
A Zircon princess seemed to lost her senses
Down at the peep show watchin' all the creeps
So she can tell her stories to the girls back home
She went to the city and got so so seditty
She had to get a pimp, she couldn't make it on her own

[Chorus]

It's like a jungle sometimes
It makes me wonder how I keep from goin' under

My brother's doin' bad, stole my mother's TV
Says she watches too much, it's just not healthy
All My Children in the daytime, Dallas at night
Can't even see the game or the Sugar Ray fight
The bill collectors, they ring my phone
And scare my wife when I'm not home
Got a bum education, double-digit inflation
Can't take the train to the job, there's a strike at the station
Neon King Kong standin' on my back
Can't stop to turn around, broke my sacroiliac
A mid-range migraine, cancered membrane
Sometimes I think I'm goin' insane
I swear I might hijack a plane!

[Chorus]

It's like a jungle sometimes
It makes me wonder how I keep from goin' under

My son said, Daddy, I don't wanna go to school
Cause the teacher's a jerk, he must think I'm a fool
And all the kids smoke reefer, I think it'd be cheaper
If I just got a job, learned to be a street sweeper
Or dance to the beat, shuffle my feet
Wear a shirt and tie and run with the creeps
Cause it's all about money, ain't a damn thing funny
You got to have a con in this land of milk and honey
They pushed that girl in front of the train
Took her to the doctor, sewed her arm on again
Stabbed that man right in his heart
Gave him a transplant for a brand new start
I can't walk through the park cause it's crazy after dark
Keep my hand on my gun cause they got me on the run
I feel like a outlaw, broke my last glass jaw
Hear them say ""You want some more?""
Livin' on a see-saw

[Chorus]

It's like a jungle sometimes
It makes me wonder how I keep from goin' under

A child is born with no state of mind
Blind to the ways of mankind
God is smilin' on you but he's frownin' too
Because only God knows what you'll go through
You'll grow in the ghetto livin' second-rate
And your eyes will sing a song called deep hate
The places you play and where you stay
Looks like one great big alleyway
You'll admire all the number-book takers
Thugs, pimps and pushers and the big money-makers
Drivin' big cars, spendin' twenties and tens
And you'll wanna grow up to be just like them, huh
Smugglers, scramblers, burglars, gamblers
Pickpocket peddlers, even panhandlers
You say I'm cool, huh, I'm no fool
But then you wind up droppin' outta high school
Now you're unemployed, all non-void
Walkin' round like you're Pretty Boy Floyd
Turned stick-up kid, but look what you done did
Got sent up for a eight-year bid
Now your manhood is took and you're a Maytag
Spend the next two years as a undercover fag
Bein' used and abused to serve like hell
Til one day, you was found hung dead in the cell
It was plain to see that your life was lost
You was cold and your body swung back and forth
But now your eyes sing the sad, sad song
Of how you lived so fast and died so young so

[Chorus]

It's like a jungle sometimes
It makes me wonder how I keep from goin' under",The Message,1994
Melle Mel & Duke Bootee,"New York New York, big city of dreams 
And everything in New York ain't always what it seems 
You might get fooled if you come from out of town 
But I'm down by law and I know my way around

Too much, too many people, too much (aha-ha) 
Too much, too many people, too much, Raaah!

A castle in the sky, one mile high 
Built to shelter the rich and greedy 
Rows of eyes, disguised as windows 
Looking down on the poor and the needy 
Miles of people, marching up the avenue 
Doin? what they gotta do, just to get by 
I'm living in the land of plenty and many 
But I'm damn sure poor and I don't know why

Too much, too many people, too much 
Too much, too many people, too much!

A man's on a ledge, says he's gonna jump 
People gather round, said, ""He won't he's just a chump"" 
?Cause he lost his job, then he got robbed 
His mortgage is due and his marriage is through 
He says he ain't gonna pay no child support
Because the bitch left him without a second thought 
He got nothing to eat, no shoes on his feet 
She even left his clothes out in the street 
He keeps hearing noises when he's at home
He always hears voices when he's all alone 
His wife took the kids, the car and the crib 
In this man's world, so much for Women's Lib

New York New York big city of dreams 
But everything in New York ain't always what it seems 
You might get fooled if you come from out of town 
But I'm down by law, and I know my way around

Down in the Village, you might think I'm silly 
But you can't tell the women from the men sometimes 
They're sugar and spice and everything nice 
But when you get ?em home ain't no telling what you find
Right next door is a little old man
I seen him eating dog food out of a can
He says, ""I got to eat, when I can't afford meat 
I barely can stand, on my own two feet
I got a bad habit and I just can't break it 
Something?s on my mind and I just can't shake it 
I need some time, and I want some space 
I gotta get away from the human race?

Too much, too many people, too much (aha-ha) 
Too much, too many people, too much! Raaah!

Staring at a skyscraper reaching into heaven 
When over in the ghetto I'm livin' in hell 
Just play ball or be an entertainer 
'Cause niggaz like me can't read too well
Nobody loves me, nobody cares 
I dreamed about a life but I'm livin' in a nightmare 
Paranoid schizo, set back, snowbound 
Bad news psycho, heart attack, breakdown!

If only I could sleep just ten more minutes 
I might find the strength to make another day 
If I didn't have to get up and do my thing 
I would probably sleep my whole life away
I messed up a nice dream, somethin' bout ice cream 
Whipped cream, fruits and a cherry on top 
Now I gotta get up and face the world, huh 
The pressure is on, It ain't never gonna stop
I sho' gotta learn to use my mind 
I don't want to be kissing nobody's behind 
Just standin' on line lookin' like a jerk 
Gotta get off my butt and do a full day's work
I ran into a pothole, got into a car crash 
Should?a been thinking and tried to fake whiplash 
A crowd gathered round, they're callin' me fat 
Who you lookin' at with a face like that?

New York New York big city of dreams 
Everything in New York ain't always what it seems 
You might get fooled if you come from out of town 
But I'm down by law and I know my way around

On 42nd Street, lookin' for some action 
Women standing on the corner selling satisfaction 
One young punk just leaning on the fence 
Tryin' to make a dollar out of fifteen cents
Really is a prankster, tried to be a gangster 
Real big wheel when a gun is in his hands 
Just did a stick-up, just got picked up 
One dead punk, killed by the man

A baby cries and a mother dies 
And the tears fall from the doctor's eyes
Because in this room, on this day 
The Good Lord has giveth, and taketh away, huh!
The gift of life really means a lot 
And in the ghetto your life is all you got 
So you take to the streets, trying to exist 
In the trash and slime of a world like this
What you watch on TV tells you what life is supposed to be 
But when you look outside the only thing you see 
Is the poverty stricken reality, Heh!
Abandoned places, angry faces 
Much hate and hunger throughout the races 
You say, ""I'm grown and I'm on my own 
So why don't everybody just leave me alone!""
Now you stay at home, talking on the phone 
Doin' ninety miles an hour in the fifty mile zone 
They never took the time to tell you ?bout sex 
So you had to learn about it in the discotheques
Nine months later, the baby is there 
And the Nigga that did it said, ""I don't care!"" 
You don't have enough money to help feed two 
So you have to choose between the baby and you
The sky was crying, rain and hail 
When you put your baby in the garbage pail 
Then you kissed the kid and put down the lid 
And you tried to forget what you just did, Huh!
The muffled screams of a dying baby 
Was enough to drive the young mother crazy 
So she ran in the rain trying to ease the pain 
Huh huh, And she drove herself insane

Melle Mel & the Furious 5,"Beat Street Breakdown, rrrrhaa!

Beat Street, the king of the beat
You see him rockin' that beat from across the street
And huh-huh, Beat Street is a lesson, too
Because ah, you can't let the streets beat you
Uh!

Well, a picture can express a thousand words
To describe all the beauty of life you give
And if the world was yours to do over
I know you'd paint a better place to live
Where the colors would swirl
And the boys and girls can grow in peace and harmony
And where murals stand on walls so grand
As far as the eyes are able to see, ha
I never knew art till I saw your face
And there'll never be one to take your place
'Cause each and every time you touch a spraypaint can
Michaelangelo's soul controls your hands
Then serenades of blue and red
And the beauty of the rainbow fills your head
Crescendo colors playin' tunes
Man why oh why you'd have to die so soon?
Ashes to ashes and dust to dust
Where the good die young is all thy must
Cause as life must live death must die
And the tears shall fall from the living eye
Huh, teardrops fall for the state of mind
Of the beautiful lady that you left behind
In love and alone, but now you're dead
And she still can't get you out of her head, huh
More tears fall for all you've done
Tried to be a good father to your only son
But now who's gonna make sure that he's fed
Put a shirt on his back and a roof over head?
Tell me who's gonna dream the impossible dream
Of the beautiful cities and the island's  ? 
When your works of art brought into being
All that the ghetto stopped you from seeing
Bums on the sidewalk, garbage in the street
Abandoned buildings, bricks of concrete
The ladies on the corner are sellin that body
And everybody wants a part in that party
I'm hangin' out tough rockin' late at night
Runnin' wild in the town of the neon lights
You either play some ball or stand in the hall
Huh, you gotta make somethin' out of nothin' at all
I'm sittin' in the classroom learnin' the rules
And it says you can't do graffiti in school
That can't be wrong in the hallowed hall
So my notebook turned into a big wall
The heart of a lion and the courage of three
And the mind of a man much wiser than me
You're the soul of the brother who won't come back
Who died in my arms on the railroad track
Cause I'm caught in a rat race lookin' for my own space
It gotta be a better place for you and me
There's pie in the sky and a eye for a eye
Some people gotta die just to be free
You search for justice and what do you find?
You find just us on the unemployment line
You find just us sweatin' from dawn to dusk
There's no justice, it's, huh, just us
Still life urban masterpiece
Your trademark was written on trains and walls
A million dollar gift only God released
Huh, and yet you got killed for nothin' at all
So after this there'll be no more hard time
No more bad times and no more pain
No more chump change, none of that bull
Just movies, museums and the hall of fame
So all you hip-hops, get on up
And let's take it to the top where we belong
Cause the age of the Beat Street wave is here
Everybody let's sing along, now come on
And say hooo (Hooo)
Say hooo (Hooo)
And to let me know I'm rockin the microphone
Everybody say Ramon (Ramon)
Ramon (Ramon)
Rrrrhaa!

A newspaper burns in the sand
And the headlines say 'Man Destroys Man'
Extra extra, read all the bad news
On the war for peace that everybody would lose
The rise and fall, the last great empire
The sound of the whole world caught on fire
The ruthless struggle, the desperate gamble
The game that left the whole world in shambles
The cheats, the lies, the alibies
And the foolish attempts to conquer the sky
Lost in space, and what is it worth?
Huh, the President just forgot about Earth
Spendin' multi-billions and maybe even trillions
The cost of weapons ran in the zillions
There's gold in the street and there's diamond under feet
And the children in Africa don't even eat
Flies on their faces, they're livin' like mice
And their houses even make the ghetto look nice
Huh, the water tastes funny, it's forever too sunny
And they work all month and don't make no money
A fight for power, a nuclear shower
A people shout out in the darkest hour
Sights unseen and voices unheard
And finally the bomb gets the last word
Christians killed Muslims and Germans killed Jews
And everybody's bodies are used and abused
Huh, minds are poisoned and souls are polluted
Superiority complex is deep rooted
Leeches and lices, and people got prices
Egomaniacs control the self-righteous
Nothin' is sacred and nothin' is pure
So the revelation of death is our cure
Peoples in terror, the leaders made a error
And now they can't even look in the mirror
Cause we gotta suffer while things get rougher
And that's the reason why we got to get tougher
So learn from the past and work for the future
And don't be a slave to no computer
Cause the children of Man inherit the land
And the future of the world is in your hands
So just throw your hands in the air
And wave em like you just don't care
And if you believe that you're the future
Scream it out and say oh yeah (Oh yeah)

and I'll rock you, until you give me the rest
I keep on it, until you start to fess

I bet you can't think of a greater task
I make my light shine on your cloudy days
You can surf if you want to, on my waves
I caress your soft body on those mellow nights
A continuous thing, to the morning light
It's reality, it's not a dream
It's nothing less than the best when it's from Raheem

Now it's my turn so understand
That I'm the Kid Creole, and I'm a ladies man
I don't, have a lot of women hangin on my steez
Only one fine lady that you better believe
I say Annette's her name, and that's the truth
I give a lot of things up, before I turn her loose
It's just her, and that's simple and plain
And that's the only way I run my game

Well I'ma, Cowboy and I'm the real McCoy
I'm chocolate all over like an Almond Joy
Bowlegged cool brother and you will agree
On top of the world for the ladies to see
Gonna hip gonna hop gonna rock the spot
Gonna make everybody want to rock rock rock
Gonna do it to the East, want to do it to the West
Gonna make you relax right upon your chest

Built to shelter the rich and greedy 
Rows of eyes, disguised as windows 
Looking down on the poor and the needy

But you can't tell the women from the men sometimes 
They're sugar and spice and everything nice 
But when you get ?em home ain't no telling what you find
Right next door is a little old man
I seen him eating dog food out of a can
He says, ""I got to eat, when I can't afford meat

In the trash and slime of a world like this
What you watch on TV tells you what life is supposed to be 
But when you look outside the only thing you see 
Is the poverty stricken reality, Heh!
Abandoned places, angry faces 
Much hate and hunger throughout the races 
You say, ""I'm grown and I'm on my own 
So why don't everybody just leave me alone!""
Now you stay at home, talking on the phone 
Doin' ninety miles an hour in the fifty mile zone 
They never took the time to tell you ?bout sex 
So you had to learn about it in the discotheques
Nine months later, the baby is there 
And the Nigga that did it said, ""I don't care!"" 
You don't have enough money to help feed two 
So you have to choose between the baby and you
The sky was crying, rain and hail 
When you put your baby in the garbage pail 
Then you kissed the kid and put down the lid 
And you tried to forget what you just did, Huh!

Was enough to drive the young mother crazy 
So she ran in the rain trying to ease the pain

Melle Mel & the Furious 5,"Come on, I said come on, I said come on

Rappers might be willin but they ain't able
Cause I was their king straight from my cradle
I screamed and hollered and shook my rattle
And dreamt of defeating them all in battle

There was no food in my silver spoon
So I grew up hard and I grew up soon
I'm a righteous king but I'm hungry too
And I eat up chumps that rap like you

Then I met this shark and his name was Jaws
He was biting my rhymes like y'all bite yours
I starting writing my rhymes the shark grew and grew
But I was writing more rhymes than the shark could chew 

The shark got sick and then he exploded 
Cause he didn't realize that my rhymes was loaded
They flew in the air and into the sea
And the whole universe knew that the king was me

Come on, I said come on, I said come on

I'm not a laser beam or a diamond mine
Or a platinum watch or some vintage wine 
Not a pocket full of pearls I'm a oil well
Like black gold baby I'm Melle Mel

And to all the fly girls I come off hard 
The slightest wink or nod makes me your god
All my problems are small so my pockets are large
When I walk in the door Oh baby I'm in charge 

Treat ladies like jewels and diamond rings
On my fingers on my arms on everything
On the streets oh my Jesus! I can't be beat 
So don't ask where's the beef baby here is the meat

I'm gonna give you some soap a towel and a cup 
Cause the bum emcees are all washed up
Put your women on the line with the rest of my crew
So I can make love to her and annihilate you

Pump, pump ( me up!) me what? (me up!)
Pump, pump, pump, pump me up!

I'm like the genie in your lamp
A face on your stamp
The hip hop rocker 
The microphone champ

Got a knock out voice
Like a Rolls Royce 
Gotta rank as number one 
To be the people's choice 

Cause you can hum a ding then you can hum a dong
Its just like the friendly game of ping pong
When you hitting the ball upside the paddle 
It's just like cowboy riding on a saddle 

Up above your head is the flash of light 
Cause I can rock to the beat on any God given night
Like to rock like to roll like to entertain 
While my car's outside you're waiting for the train

The train to the bus the bus to whatever 
And I'm the type of MC to rock in any type of weather 
I'm the bow legged brother there'll never be another
I bought a mansion for my mother

Come on, I said come on, I said come on

I got a certain cool that breaks the rules
That get me paid and a lot of jewels
And the women I'm calling day and night 
That's proof I'm getting mine like a thief in the night

Because Scorp is known as the singer
The quiet storm that lover didn't linger
I will not change cause its in my blood 
I'm like dynamite and you a rappin dud

And if the future is here in the making
Then why I can't be part of the taking
Cause you know I like cars and fancy women 
That give me good love in the beginning 

Bubble bath and candle lights 
And girls saying Scorp you alright? 
So stop standing there
I'm not a laser beam or a diamond mine
Or a platinum watch or some vintage wine 
Not a pocket full of pearls I'm a oil well
Like black gold baby I'm Melle Mel

And to all the fly girls I come off hard 
The slightest wink or nod makes me your god
All my problems are small so my pockets are large

Chaka Khan let me rock you, let me rock you Chaka Khan
I said let me rock you that's all I wanna do
Chaka Khan let me rock you, let me rock you Chaka Khan
I said let me rock you 'cause I feel for you
Chaka Khan won't you tell me what you wanna do
Do you feel for me the way I feel for you
Chaka Khan let me tell you what I wanna do
I wanna love you, wanna hug you, wanna squeeze you too
So let me take you in my arms, let me fill you with my charms
Chaka, 'cause you know that I'm the one to keep you warm, Chaka
I'll make you more than just a physical spell
I wanna rock you Chaka baby 'cause my name is Melle Mel

Because you got to get lost because you know you're soft (ha, ha!)
Step, Step, Step, Step, Step off
Because you got to get lost because you know you're soft

I was sitting on the corner just a wasting my time
When I realised I was the king of the rhyme
I got on the microphone and what do you see huh!
The rest was my legacy
I was born to be the king of the be bop swing
To have Stallions and medallions, big diamond rings
To own a castle and a yacht, two million in gold
'Cause rap is the game that I control
I'm like Shakespeare, I'm a pioneer
Because I made rap something people wanted to hear
See before my reign it was the same old same
You took ""the ba with the ba""
That's street-talk game
So if you ever, let me make this clear
If you ever think that we're stepping out of here
You ever think you're getting up, down, around or in huh huh!
You better think again my friend
Because the door is closed and we're in town
And the only place you can go is down

Step, Step, Step, Step, Step off

Well, I'm Keith Cowboy and you're my cow
So what ya M.C's gonna do now?
It's gonna be a slaughter and here's my plan
You won't even get bread and water my man
Gonna put you on the racks like a pair of slacks
With another wack rapper tied to your back
And if you wanna hang yourself out to dry
It's the beautiful round up in the sky
I'm the carry-out kid when my trigger's at cock
I'll be carrying out bodies stiff as a rock
Carrying out a million dollars in my pockets and hand
But I carry out orders from no man
'Cause anything you wanna do I already did
You used to see me rock the house when you was a kid
But in my M.C school, my class was packed
And tricks were for kids so I left your ass back
The bow-legged brother, there'll never be another
I'll buy a mansion for my mother
A 24/7, the cool-aid smile
Say hey Track 11, look at my power

c'mon
Now you know just who I am
And what I do because I'm in demand
Because I look good, do you hear my man?
And if you can't take that ya chump ya own hand
You one-girl-at-a-time getting M.C
So how could you think that you rank with me?
If you only did your homework you would surely find
When Scorp get girls, they all be fine
And the only girl that you could take of mine
Is the one that I left way behind
And plus you're cheap, you're petty, your music is trash
You need to go to the bank and get some cash
Because talking don't pay, you're drifting away
When I see you on a stage I'm a blow you away
You're right, there is no difference between me and you
Except I look good and you look Through
Take that!

Step, Step, Step, Step, Step off
Because you got to get lost because you know you're soft

Little pieces of a dream is all you mean
Since the day you stepped in to the M.C scene
Biting your moves, taking fake awards
Saying everyone else was perpertrating a fraud
But your nothing but a clone of my flesh and bone
Now you trying to play grown on the microphone
But I'll tell ya 'bout a night, and ya know I'm right
When you listen to us rocking to the broad daylight
And then you looked in the sky and you started to cuss
But then you prayed to God that you could be like us
Then God was great and God was true
And he tried to show you how to be like you
But you still didn't get where you wanted to go
When you gathered in a group and got your own show
'Cause without the source, the force won't survive
For eternity the source is alive
You forgot the words of your creator
And now he's made you a perpertrator
Forever in a world of you and a girl
A few grams in a pipe to make your head swirl
You must spread the word of the master teacher
Or you die by the rhymes and the streets'll eat ya
The words are a gift we will never flaunt
That's why were gonna get everything we want
'Cause like a shadow in the night, I'm the sight unseen
And I'm the bona-fide vocal master supreme
And I'm here to run it down for the ladies and gents
'Cause my rhymes make vowels plus they make sense
See I'm down with Cowboy, you will rock the show
With King Lou, Tommy Gun and huh! Scorpio
Kami-Kazi, Clayton Savage and Easy Mike
And going down in the books is the king of the night
So if you're ever in a battle, I'm a make you my slave
And I'm a give you a shovel so you can dig a grave
Leave behind all your fame and wealth
So you can say one rhyme then bury yourself huh!
I may sound possessed, but you know I'm blessed
With the will to make sense of all this mess
I'm the power of the sun that shines in the sky
And I'm the only M.C that'll never die
So just rock and don't stop 'til you hit the top
But when you se Melle Mel you're gonna have to drop
RAAH!

On my superfly cold crushin' fame and glory
How I rocked the children and the young ladies
I even rocked the countries that was overseas
'Cause I can rock anybody from any crew
Because I did it to Chaka, I'm a do it to you
I'm a show ya how I rocked it y'all all night long
But when I rock with Chaka Khan I just said

Chaka Khan let me rock you, let me rock you Chaka Khan
I said let me rock you that's all I wanna do
Chaka Khan let me rock you, let me rock you Chaka Khan
I said let me rock you 'cause I feel for you

Do you feel for me the way I feel for you

'Cause were coming out fresh with a brand new batch
So taking you off into the galaxy

Sous le ciel gris de villes grises
Qui brisent mon pauvre coeur

Jamais d'espoir, jamais de joie
Notre âme ploie en sa douleur

Fermons les yeux, que tout s'efface
L'espace, redevient bleu

Dans l'infini qui tire le soleil d'Afrique,
Sur les tropiques luit sous le ciel d'Afrique,

Chaque instant semble meilleur qu'ailleurs
Et pour nous tout est désir, plaisir, au pays ensorceleur.
Son appel magique fait surgir devant nos yeux  des jeux,
Et des danses où toujours l’amour ,
Met son rythme plein de feu.

Une voix en moi s'élève
Et sans trêve, elle dit :
Tu ne dois chercher ton rêve
Loin du ciel de ton pays.

Sous le ciel d'Afrique,

Et pour nous tout est désir, plaisir, au pays bleu du bonheur

But I ain't move nothing, I'm on my grind hustling
Come at me wrong and my chrome gon' give you a concussion
I love to ride fresh, but hate to ride with Tecs
But the way that these jackers roll up, knowing for the best
With diamonds on my neck, bulletproof vest on chest
I got my own laws, I'm here to serve and protect
Myself, because they ain't finna get me
I'm in the club sober as fuck and you won't catch me tipsy

You get three slugs to ya throat and I'm fo' sho' cause they don't know
I'm on a mission to get paid
Trying to plot or set me up you get ya whole block sprayed
And I ain't knockin' ya hustle but a hollow head will hurt
In the heat of the moment, let's see if that heat gon buck first
And I'm a aim for the worst to make a jacker fall flat
And if I do get jacked, you better believe I'm coming back in all black

In eighteen thirteen the Creeks uprose
addin' redskin arrows to the country's woes
Now, Injun fightin' is somethin' he knows, 
so he shoulders his rifle an' off he goes
Davy, Davy Crockett, the man who don't know fear!

Off through the woods he's a marchin' along
makin' up yarns an' a singin' a song
itchin' fer fightin' an' rightin' a wrong
he's ringy as a be	'are an' twict as strong

his reg'lar soldiers we'll put to shame
Them redskin varmints us Volunteers'll tame
'cause we got the guns with the sure-fire aim

Headed back to war from the ol' home place
but Red Stick was leadin' a merry chase
fightin' an' burnin' at a devil's pace
south to the swamps on the Florida Trace
Davy, Davy Crockett, trackin' the redskins down!

Fought single-handed through the Injun War
till the Creeks was whipped an' peace was in store
An' while he was handlin' this risky chore
made hisself a legend for evermore

that his Injun friends could keep their land
An' the rest of his life he took the stand
that justice was due every redskin band
Davy, Davy Crockett, holdin' his promise dear!

Home fer the winter with his family
happy as squirrels in the ol' gum tree
bein' the father he wanted to be
close to his boys as the pod an' the pea
Davy, Davy Crockett, holdin' his young'uns dear!

But the ice went out an' the warm winds came
an' the meltin' snow showed tracks of game
An' the flowers of Spring filled the woods with flame
an' all of a sudden life got too tame
Davy, Davy Crockett, headin' on West again!

Off through the woods we're ridin' along
makin' up yarns an' singin' a song
He's ringy as a be	'are an' twict as strong
an' knows he's right 'cause he ain' often wrong
Davy, Davy Crockett, the man who don't know fear!

Lookin' fer a place where the air smells clean
where the trees is tall an' the grass is green
where the fish is fat in an untouched stream
an' the teemin' woods is a hunter's dream
Davy, Davy Crockett, lookin' fer Paradise!

Now he's lost his love an' his grief was gall
in his heart he wanted to leave it all
an' lose himself in the forests tall
but he answered instead his country's call
Davy, Davy Crockett, beginnin' his campaign!

Needin' his help they didn't vote blind
They put in Davy 'cause he was their kind
sent up to Nashville the best they could find
a fightin' spirit an' a thinkin' mind
Davy, Davy Crockett, choice of the whole frontier!

The votes were counted an' he won hands down
so they sent him off to Washin'ton town
with his best dress suit still his buckskins brown
a livin' legend of growin' renown
Davy, Davy Crockett, the Canebrake Congressman!

He went off to Congress an' served a spell
fixin' up the Govern'ments an' laws as well
took over Washin'ton so we heered tell
an' patched up the crack in the Liberty Bell
Davy, Davy Crockett, seein' his duty clear!

Him an' his jokes travelled all through the land
an' his speeches made him friends to beat the band
His politickin' was their favorite brand
an' everyone wanted to shake his hand
Davy, Davy Crockett, helpin' his legend grow!

He knew when he spoke he sounded the knell
of his hopes for White House an' fame as well
But he spoke out strong so hist'ry books tell
an' patched up the crack in the Liberty Bell
Davy, Davy Crockett, seein' his duty clear!

When he come home his politickin' done
the western march had just begun
So he packed his gear an' his trusty gun
an' lit out grinnin' to follow the sun
Davy, Davy Crockett, leadin' the pioneer!

He heard of Houston an' Austin so
to the Texas plains he jest had to go
Where freedom was fightin' another foe
an' they needed him at the Alamo
Davy, Davy Crockett, the man who don't know fear!

And now you are broke so you earned a lot,

Since you moved out of there.

My chain light up like a lamp 'cause now I'm back with the camp
I'm crawling similar to a ant 'cause I'm low to the earth
People's feelings get hurt when they figure out what I'm worth
I got eighty fours poking out at the club I'm showing out
I'm a player ain't no doubt hoes want to know what I'm bout
Biggest diamonds off in my mouth princess cuts all in my chain
Wood grain all in my range dripping stains when I switch lanes
Switched the name It's still the same Swisha House or Swisha Blast
Mike Jones he running the game and Magnificent bout his cash
Michael Watts he made me hot hard work took me to the top
G. Dash took me to the lot he wrote a check and bought a drop
I got the internet going nuts
But T. Farris got my back so now I'm holding my nuts
It's Paul Wall baby what you know bout me
I'm on that five nine Southle baby holla at me

Mellow Man Ace,"You better run and hide when you hear my growl
'Cause I'm a hip hop creature, and I'm on the prowl
While I'm talkin' I'm stalkin', and rappers are my prey
I creep at night and I sleep all day

I despise the sunrise, swoon the moonrise
Then like a beast I increase in size 
But your cries ain't nothin' to me, cause I don't pity you
And my mission is to cold get rid of you

Bitin MC's, I'm fightin' MC's
Bring em to their knees, plus: ""Drive on, please
Spare my life!"" but you're a sacrifice
I write the rhymes from the blood drippin' off my mic 
It ain't Jason, it ain't Poltergeist

Even though the rhymes are fly, it ain't Vincent Price
It's just the first part of the double feature
So you better run, boy, cause I'm the Hip Hop Creature

I make Jeckyll & Hyde seem like Hansel & Gretel
Tom & Jerry, or Albert and Costello
But yo, this ain't slapstick, it's like a horror flick
And I'm a gool, and I'm here to school

Mediocre rappers with a style that's scary
And eerie, which makes you leary
You not even want to look in my direction
And grab a cross, and think that's your protection

But yo, this ain't Dracula, that's too regular
I'm much more frightening, especially when lightning
Strikes, and it's 12 midnight
You're in for the scare of your life

'Cause it's a fright night-mare
There's no way you can run, cause I'll reach ya
And furthermore I fight you and I beat ya
And here's the second part of the feature
You better run, homebody, cause I'm the Hip Hop Creature

I'm the Hip Hop Creature, here to do my job
Scare the suckers, cause my monologue is McCobb
That's why MC's see me and try to get chummy
I rap so close around em and they end up like a mummy

Dummy, you gets nothin' from me
Except the creeps, so I suggest you keep 
A safe distance between you and I
Stay back, like Brooklyn: do or die

'Cause I'm 'bout to knock you out like Tyson on a roll
Hit you with a beat, I rhyme outta control
A non-stop attack landin' on your brain
You're lookin' kinda wobbly, do you know your name?

Now the match is over, I put you in your place
Forget Al Pacino, I'm the Rap Scarface
I got directors flockin' to have me in their feature

(Rhyme was def, and then it went this way...)

Basically it's like this
My patterns of talking exist
As a funky maneuver of reciting lyrics
Stayin' calm, but then droppin' my bombs

With my voltrons, protons and my atoms
Boom! An explosion, I'm speakin' very complicated
Where others have failed I have conquered and excelerated
Like Courtland in his court I command the fort

The teacher that's teachin', and I need no support
Now few people can talk, but more people can gawk
But I prefer that you be down with my block
Because my funky dope spanglish for sure gettin' dumb

Evaluatin' suckers scared of my second comin'
Now everytime I see ya, you try to bite the formula
But I'm just ignorin' ya, and tellin' ya, it ain't for ya
Don't take this as a diss, fella or dweller
Just showin' you my form through my Talkapella

(Ooh, that's funky)
(Ooh, that's funky, momma)

(Rhyme was def, and then it went this way...)

Yes, I'm the one with the profound sound
Clockin' my music dope all around
See, from what I give ya you will receive
It's all in the delivery from A-see-e

And I'm lettin' you know that I'm controllin' mine

I could buck your head, yeah (buck)
I could buck your head one time, yo

But see, I haven't got the time to do the crime, yo
No, I haven't got the time to do the time, yo
I'm just hypin', hypin' up the atmosphere, y'all
There's no one that I fear, y'all, I make this very clear, y'all

I smack you with a lyric until you start to cheer, y'all
So listen to the funky chumpie that I brought to share, y'all
Not a ??? of character, but I'm still there after
Everyone's gone from the scene, cause I don't care if the...

I just want to bring, yo, my crazy funky lingo
Displayed upon the microphone when I want to swing, yo
Yes, my talkism is gonna be a seller
Through my Talkapella

(Ooh, that's funky)
(Ooh, that's funky, momma)

By now you love the rhythm
'Cause how I like to give em
I'm not a greedy brother, you want some?
Take this for some

Now get funky, that's why I gave it to ya
That's right, I definitely had to save it for ya
Yes, I want you to enjoy my methods of speak
No worries, be happy, mi tribe is elite

Yes, I'm equipped with the hype tip
Of speakin', yes, talkin' somethin' you can deal with
But it's somethin' 'bout the hip-hop, we just can't live without it
Give us a place to be, and then we'll absolutely house it

The beat concoct trauma after at a coma
And you will find an exclamation after the word drama!
Then you will learn I'm on ya, and I will be upon ya

The majestic sun rose and those in the city
Were astonished at the fact that Mellow was more gritty
Praise to the Lord of Hopes who puts the devil in his place
And brought forth Mellow Man Ace
From the camp of the Latin Thugs and Soul Assassins
Full of concepts and ideas that just be blastin
Conquerin fear and all who's in his path
Complete with a staff to tabulate the math
Standin on the word like tons of concrete
Battlin defeat and rose to his feet
Establishin the goal that so long ago was stole
Achievin heights of up to platinum and gold
Catchin the thief in his tracks, expect sevenfold
Double what he had for every lie told
Weatherin the storm and that's word bond
Plantin the seed that brings forth the corn

Of full manifestations that cut like razor blades

Were hatin from the sideline as they read his name
Walkin through the valley of the shadow of death
Spittin game at em till his very last breath
Comin from the slums of the North Hollywood
Re-inventing himself like a true player should
All acolades pre-written before time
Way back in the days before they sent the first rhyme
See the crowds gather as they flock in great strengths
Bringin him gifts and travel to great lengths

Dodgin all bullets from telescopic rifles
Armed with the Word, so who shall come against?

Heavy rotation, you hear him on your station
Make no mistake, this is true revelation
Since the days of Noah and the floods to the arch
He had nuff game to put the park into the dark
The lyrics lead the way and let you see the vision
As it all comes to pass comes the fruitful vision
The musical arrangement wins treasure of the year
A true masterpiece from Collective Funkateerz
Now the day is dawning, the sun cracks the skyline
Through metropolis echos out another fly rhyme
Miraculous miracles, a verse from the Lord
Words breathe life or death, a double-edged sword

Oh it's a hard life we live but nothing's changed
Ever since I was a kid, so I fucked with somethin' that I still don't get
Maybe it's in my genes, maybe I was born to be spiteful and mean
But whatever it is, I wouldn't change a thing
It's all about living life in the fast lane

One hundred per cent, natural born loser
That never sold out, not even once
Dedicate my life to rockin' mics, dirtbikes and knockin' out fronts
A menace to sobrierty with a variety of mental problems
I'm refusin' to quit till I hit rock bottom
Addicted to cadillacs, jumbo Jacks, twelve packs and fat tracks
The local bar superstar whose mind's scarred
From punchin' the time card
A strip club stalker, late night street walker
Alone or with the boner
Tryna make some money but my printer's out of toner

I know it's over
But life goes on
And this old world will keep on turning
Let's just be glad
We had some time to spend together
There's no need to watch the bridges
That were burning

Lay your head upon my pillow
Hold your warm and tender body
Close to mine
Hear the whisper of the rain drops
Blowing soft against the window
And make believe you love me
One more time
For the good times

I'll get along
You'll find another
And I'll be here
If you should find you ever need me
Don't say a word about tomorrow
Or forever
There'll be time enough for sadness
When you leave me

They call the po-po, I'm cocking back the fo'-fo'
The one man army, my automatic Rose Gold
Double O, subtract one numero from Seven
Taking niggas back to school like a bus ride for adolescence
Wolves plotting for their future like fucking investments
And I go so hard, that's why your bitch keep on caressing
Flat iron and pressing my VCR buttons
But this a DVD so you can watch it with your cousins
2010, bitch we get it in
Go ahead and tell your friends, I hope them bitches be twins
Doobies in Jacuzzi's, white bitches with big booties
I'm a pirate, going after them diamonds and them rubies

I be like hello, play them corners like their cellos
It go crazy in the streets when the hype gets mellow
(I got my feet up, laid back, smoking on a haze sack
Sitting on a haystack, we go off like grenade caps)
Makeshift millions, knocking down your buildings
Know they fear me I'm a villain, stacking dollars to the ceiling
(I'm on the corner for you, judge me I'll destroy your lawyer
Outta Luckett like Letoya, Mellow one's to Hype to bore you)

Girl you so sour but you're sweet like candy
Let's fuck in the forest, mother nature and Bambi
Balling like Camby, organic like cran' be
Glass house on a beach for when I want to get sandy
Everything is dandy, ask my nigga Handy
I take a strike in L.A. Lights like I'm dodging with Manny
Girls drop them panties, even their aunties... no grannies
Grandma, I'm leaking on the beat like a tampon
Fool, I'm spitting 'til my whole Odd Future camps on
We get our camp on, Jansport and Eddie Bauer
Stay fresh before hopping up in any shower
Death to haters tryna take minutes up off my hour
I got the hood with me, I'm the nigga with the power
Weed, cocaine, and the muthafuckin' Zannies
Me and Brain lurk together like a fucking family

I be like hello, play them corners like their cellos
It go crazy in the streets when the hype gets mellow

I mastered this in Sessions I be last to hit
But my confidence brim, that means there's none after this
This rhyme spitting done turned me to a convict
I'm fucking sick, there's no resolution to this conflict
Well, death might be one
But there's no stopping these wolves, for your heads we come
I'm a rider, garage got motorbikes in it
They're confused, scratch their heads like there's fucking lice in it
Party hard, man it's Golden, have them hands foldin'
Mellow keep it rollin', that's how we stay Loaded
Like them fo'-fo's, they stay in them four-doors
Bitches watch when they go slow, we pimp them hoes that drive Rodeo's
And Volvo's, because they fuck with lame niggas
They ain't learn? Hatin' niggas won't make your chain bigger
You're comedy to me and crowds flee when your shit's on
You get fake applause like a TV sitcom",Loaded,2010

She handles herself a classic
She got a nice ass but she can't run no games on me
She claim to like the stores and the clothes
Jeans bleached with the holes, but she can't get my bank homey
Too smart is no good, if she smart for no good it's so good
She can't flaunt her thing on me
She can be full of swag, drive a Jag, poppin' tags on the Ave
But she can't get her cake from me
That sounded like the hook I threw at her in the Swagger I rode in
Said she came to feel me in, when she really came to fill me in
Like baby what's the deal with it?
Seem to be attracted by the fiancee and finance that no wifey concealin' it
Dealin' with life's shuffle, then fold
Dippin' with the duffles I hold
If we are a couple, let's go
To the place where we lead in the life ?

My button-up's a nigga and the jacket's Caucasian
Oh, Black and white crimes is the justification
Gold tie to separate them from their closest relation
Cause shit, a nigga's actions like acceleration
And if I die before you die, I'll be in Hell awaiting
I'm a sick-minded freak, six minds kinda think
Sitcom-blinded geek found life by hide-and-seek
I climb the steep, a few times a week
The line's with skeet, the blondest streak
Life is a bitch cause she kinda sweet
Then go behind your spinal structure cause she sly and weak
Four bars left and I'm-a lie in the street
Where the crosswalk is met by a 90 degree
Two bars and going before the light turn green
One bar and come and blink to the next scene
Bitch I'm a red camera, scannin' all of you amateurs
Me and my dangerous wolves are running Los Angeles
Dope in the can of this canister, green cannabis
Write Mellowhype on the banister, get my analysis
I like how being anal sits, tell 'em stick to the manuscript
I think with the same hand I writ, breakin' grams down
My word's my bond, like I write with my dick, the night is crypt
Bitch, Mellowhype!

I illustrate the path that I journey
Can't nobody see me, nor can somebody hurt me
Flow contagious like a herpe at the tip of a Slurpie
Straw that you draw in your effective cause friend

[Chorus]
Close your eyes, what do you see?

I see nothing sometimes, I see nothing but rhymes
Mental crimes, fulfill the lonely chimes and percussion
Melodies of keys are the remedies of these
The only steeze is the snare blowin' smoke in the air
I see the wear-and-tear emotions fallin' off your weary shoulders
Browsin' the I-don't-care folder seems to be the escape
Determination is the key, you gotta let go of faith
And everyone you gave your faith to so faithful
Ungrateful, they make you, and they make you sad
Hop out of your passenger seat heated, catchin' a cab
The fiasco just opened up a closed scab
Sore feelings, more feelings, your feelings collaborate

[Chorus]

As some rise to a sun rise
In the same clothes from yesterdays
Though the umpire is unsound
My team is a squad who works to make a play
Look for tomorrow today is what I always say
'Cause if tomorrow's today then I'm just a blink away
I find my happiness through all of this rappin' shit
If it wasn't for rappin shit Id be present with gats and bricks
The cat that scratch the itch
My skin is irritated
Eyes low from weed smoke shit I'm clearly shaded
Sailin' Jerry Shots bottle tops inebriated
Afraid to look in the mirror to see I really made it
I notice an hour pass
I shatter the hour glass
Matter can overpower mass if it really matters
I live in the moment and not a minute after
Count the page numbers
I write the next chapter

[Chorus]

My feet are on the ground
But I'mma touch the sky
First Ima roll this L
Light it
And I'mma get real high
But I'mma seize the moment
And you ask why?
Why
I'mma seize the moment
And not let shit pass me
By

Walk into the light
I know its gloomy
Find your own way
Um
Eventually you'll see
Life lessons get told more than a eulogy
Cruelty in a crew-a-tee
Stinging like a poolabee
In a crewatee stinging like a pool of bees
You can't smoke if ain't grew the weed
You ain't shit without some jewelry
I got some homegrown and my gold on like what you do to me?
No gun around me
But I murder brutally
Vertibly, suitably
Ready for battle
In a battlefield use my bats for shields
And a mustang horse ridden saddle
Exsists in a world full of hassle
I gotta graduate so I can flip my
Tassle in life
And look forward to whats next
Until death cross my body and my lungs run out of breath
Its OF

Where I stand still fucking awesome I am
Meet chains with more rocks then rocks and sand in Iran
I saute the chef and if its I you want to test
It will be one big room full of triple 6 reppers
Always say that I'm lo key with my moves
'Cause I'm a ninja I don't like niggas to see what I do
And my focus was on saving grace
Till I got that late call that wolf killed ace
Heard he sprayed up the place
Well I'm the midnight marauder that makes twilight music
And fans think that I'm more awkward then Kristen Stewart
Couldn't do it without the losers that thought I wouldn't do it
No sympathy for the ones that never stuck to it
Attack em, rack em, wrap em in the back of a Buick
Wonder how my day goes it ain't nothing but music
And wonder how I spend my evenings and my kind of night would be
See my kind of night would be nylon rope duct tape

Up the price of the venue
You and your nephew, you niece is also in the car
Pretty barrettes in their hair-do
Don't drive too fast, be careful
Make sure the seat belts are on before you switch from park to drive
Because once the car starts, the reflex is the eye
Between you and I, and the being in the sky
I have a human oversight, no equated calculations
Practice sanitation

Lot of people talk with their game with their mouth
Dangerous people to hang with

Dilated junkies make the rookies drive slow

He don't need no introduction, he just bust in
Grab the turntables and then start hugging

Well, blending, rocking at twelve hundreds

Or vest tax, one of them fresh cats
The type you definitely wanna bless with rats
So recognize that you met your match
But check out Babu with the cold, cut, scratched

Break it down

Face off on tracks while you walk the plank
And now drums are come back

Whenever we step to this set is no contest
Come on, come on, come on

When I do my thing I?d be on some more of shit
To service qua two, Babu with another hit

Melodie Crittenden,"Virgil Spencer's got a nineteen inch Hitachi and many demons lingering.
Friday night he pulled a gun to change the channel,
something that he picked up from the king.
His wife remembers well the man she knew.
Seems the dreams she had have all turned black and blue,
She's wasted years. 
No time for tears
 
'cause there's another chance, and someday soon
shining like the Alabama moon.
She's looking for the promised land out beyond the lights of Birmingham.
 
It's three a.m. and Virgil's passed out on the sofa,
a fifth of Jim Beam on the floor.
She's packed a bag.  
She slips the keys out of his pocket.
She's careful not to slam the door. 
And as she drives, she rubs her rosary.
She's never been so all alone. She's never felt so free.
She got miles to go, blind faith and hope
 
'cause there's an other chance, and someday soon 
shining like the Alabama moon.
She's looking for the promised land out beyond the lights of Birmingham.
 
As the rain falls down upon the interstate,
any doubts she had are all but washed away.
One long look back at Birmingham
 
'cause there's another chance, and someday soon,
shining like the Alabama moon,
She's looking for the promised land out beyond the lights of Birmingham.

Has brought me safely home

Melody Butiu,"A bomb went off this morning raining bodies on TV
They are blaming the insurgents; they are blocking off the streets
And the smoke is rising slowly from the barrel of a gun
The solution to disruption: Order 1081

Now the sunsets are incredible across Manila Bay
You can hear the bombers landing at the U.S. Air Force base
And somewhere in the distance, out beyond the setting sun
They will sign a proclamation: Order 1081

Now, we live down by the water in a shack that's made of wood
And the bankers need to huddle so they need some extra room
We will find us somewhere better; there's enough for everyone
Got a perfect explanation: Order 1081

I thought I ordered coffee, but they gave me 7-Up
Got to clear away these shanties and these ugly nipa huts
So the seeds of our great future, they can grow here when we're done
And it's clearly all because of Order 1081

For thirty days the rain fell--we were nearly washed away
The radio fell silent; nothing left to do but pray
And the senator he told us the guerrillas are on the run
And the reason they are hiding? Order 1081

They are planting plastic flowers on the seaside esplanade
The Pope is speaking Spanish, but we can't hear what he says
Got to stop all this confusion, got to wipe away this scum
And the way to make it happen: Order 1081

It's amazing that the soldiers somehow all know how to dance
It's amazing how the soldiers keep the creases in their pants
Now it's safe to walk the streets at night; a new world has begun
Everybody's sleeping soundly thanks to 1081",Order 1081,2014

What did I do to make you mad?
I swear I only told the truth
And none of this could hurt you now
And it's no insult to be poor

So take back all your money
Although I need it more than you
Just acknowledge that you knew me
On Solano Avenue, oh

I didn't mean you any harm
I didn't mean to bring you shame
It's not a sin that we had nothing
You and I were not to blame

When they teased you on the street
When they hurt you deep inside
To me it was that you came running
And I held you when you cried

So take back all your money
Although I need it more than you
Just acknowledge that you knew me

Melody Butiu,"I heard that you were getting married
I always knew that you'd do well
You're a legendary beauty
From our small provincial town

Ilocos joined to Leyte
Two important families
A glorious occasion
A foretold destiny

I followed in the morning papers
How exciting it has been
The courtship and the whirlwind romance
For the sweetest of beauty queens

He's crazy for you
Who wouldn't be, I'm sure?
And nothing matters more than that
And you'll never be poor no more

Living before my eyes
Many years from now
We'll recall just how
How she looked when she passed by

I know that you are in there somewhere
Whole Man drawing
Letters get misplaced in the mail
Guess that there was some confusion
Amidst those throngs and swells

Did you see me outside?
Did you see me wave
When you passed in your car?
Ah, well, that's okay

And she compels you, you can't help it
Drop down to your knees
She's in your mind and you are blinded
And she put a spell on you

she's nobodys angel
She's nobodys
Nobodys angel

fever fever leave my heart alone
Teardrops down my face
I curse the day that I was born

Lost inside her grace
And you surrender sweet surrender
Bound within a sigh
She takes you under, keeps you under
And she puts a spell on you

still my fading heart beats for your love
Still my fading heart beats for love
