Invisible Strings,"What a waste of human power
What a waste of human lives
Shoot the prisoners in the towers
Forty-three poor widowed wives

Attica state, attica state
We're all mates with attica state

Media blames it on the prisoners
But the prisoners did not kill
""Rockefeller pulled the trigger""
That is what the people feel

Attica state, attica state
We're all mates with attica state

Free the prisoners, jail the judges
Free all prisoners everywhere
All they want is truth and justice
All they need is love and care

Attica state, attica state
We're all mates with attica state

They all live in suffocation
Let's not watch them die in sorrow
Now's the time for revolution
Give them all a chance to grow

Attica state, attica state
We're all mates with attica state

Come together join the movement
Take a stand for human rights
Fear and hatred clouds our judgment
Free us all from endless night

Attica state, attica state 
We're all mates with attica state

Attica state, attica state
We all live in attica state

Attica state, attica state
Attica, attica, attica state",Attica State,1972
Invisible Strings,"We're born in a prison
Raised in a prison
Sent to a prison called school

We cry in a prison
We love in a prison
We dream in a prison like fools

Wood becomes a flute when it's loved
Reach for yourself and your battered mates
Mirror becomes a razor when it's broken
Look in the mirror and see your shattered fate

We live with no reason
Kicked around for no reason
Thrown out without reason like tools

We work in a prison 
And hate in a prison 
And die in a prison as a rule

Wood becomes a flute when it's loved
Reach for yourself and your battered mates
Mirror becomes a razor when it's broken
Look in the mirror and see your shattered fate

We live in a prison 
Among judges and wardens 
And wait for no reason for you 
We laugh in a prison
Go through all four seasons
And die with no vision of truth

Wood becomes a flute when it's loved
Reach for yourself and your battered mates
Mirror becomes a razor when it's broken
Look in the mirror and see your shattered fate",Born in a Prison,1972
Invisible Strings,"It ain't fair, John Sinclair
In the stir for breathing air
Won't you care for John Sinclair?
In the stir for breathing air
Let him be, set him free
Let him be like you and me

They gave him ten for two
What else can the judges do?
Gotta, gotta, gotta, gotta, 
Gotta, gotta, gotta, gotta, 
Gotta, gotta, gotta, gotta, 
Gotta, gotta, gotta set him free

If he'd been a soldier man
Shooting gooks in Vietnam
If he was the CIA
Selling dope and making hay
He'd be free, they'd let him be
Breathing air, like you and me

They gave him ten for two
What else can the judges do?
Gotta, gotta, gotta, gotta, 
Gotta, gotta, gotta, gotta, 
Gotta, gotta, gotta, gotta, 
Gotta, gotta, gotta set him free

They gave him ten for two
They got Ali Otis too.
Gotta, gotta, gotta, gotta, 
Gotta, gotta, gotta, gotta, 
Gotta, gotta, gotta, gotta, 
Gotta, gotta, gotta set him free

Was he jailed for what he done?
Or representing everyone
Free John now, if we can
From the clutches of the man
Let him be, lift the lid
Bring him to his wife and kids

They gave him ten for two
What else can the bastards do?
Gotta, gotta, gotta, gotta, 
Gotta, gotta, gotta, gotta, 
Gotta, gotta, gotta, gotta, 
Gotta, gotta, gotta set him free",John Sinclair,1972
Invisible Strings,"If you had the luck of the Irish
You'd be sorry and wish you were dead
You should have the luck of the Irish
And you'd wish you was English instead!

A thousand years of torture and hunger
Drove the people away from their land
A land full of beauty and wonder
Was raped by the British brigands! Goddamn! Goddamn!

If you could keep voices like flowers
There'd be shamrock all over the world
If you could drink dreams like Irish streams
Then the world would be high as the mountain of morn

In the 'Pool they told us the story
How the English divided the land
Of the pain, the death and the glory
And the poets of Auld Ireland

If we could make chains with the morning dew
The world would be like Galway Bay
Let's walk over rainbows like leprechauns
The world would be one big Blarney stone

Why the hell are the English there anyway?
As they kill with God on their side
Blame it all on the kids the IRA
As the bastards commit genocide! Aye! Aye! Genocide!

If you had the luck of the Irish
You'd be sorry and wish you was dead
You should have the luck of the Irish
And you'd wish you was English instead!
Yes you'd wish you was English instead!",The Luck of the Irish,1972
Invisible Strings,"People say we got it made
Don't they know we're so afraid
Isolation
We're afraid to be alone
Everybody got to have a home
Isolation

Just a boy and a little girl
Trying to change the whole wide world
Isolation
The world is just a little town
Everybody trying to put us down
Isolation

I don't expect you, to understand
After you caused so much pain
But then again, you're not to blame
You're just a human, a victim of the insane

We're afraid of everyone
Afraid of the sun
Isolation
The sun will never disappear
But the world may not have many years
Isolation",New York City,1972

Invisible Strings,"Well it was Sunday Bloody Sunday
When they shot the people there
The cries of thirteen martyrs
Filled the free Derry air
Is there any one among you
Dare to blame it on the kids?
Not a soldier boy was bleeding
When they nailed the coffin lids!

Sunday bloody Sunday
Bloody Sunday's the day!

You claim to be majority
Well you know that it's a lie
You're really a minority
On this sweet Emerald Isle
When Stormont bans our marchers
They've got a lot to learn
Internment is no answer
It's those mother's turn to burn!

Sunday bloody Sunday
Bloody Sunday's the day!

You Anglo pigs and Scotties
Sent to colonize the north
You wave your bloody Union Jacks
And you know what it's worth!
How dare you hold on to ransom
A people proud and free
Keep Ireland for the Irish
Put the English back to sea!

Sunday bloody Sunday
Bloody Sunday's the day!

Yes it's always bloody Sunday
In the concentration camps
Keep Falls and roads free forever
From the bloody English hands
Repatriate to Britain
All of you who call it home
Leave Ireland to the Irish
Not for London or for Rome!

Sunday bloody Sunday
Bloody Sunday's the day!",Sunday Bloody Sunday,1972
Invisible Strings,"There may not be much difference
Between Chairman Mao and Richard Nixon
If we strip them naked

There may not be much difference
Between Marilyn Monroe and Lenny Bruce
If we check their coffins

There may not be much difference
Between White House and Hall of People
If we count their windows

There may not be much difference
Between Raquel Welch and Jerry Rubin
If we hear their heartbeat

We're all water from different rivers
That's why it's so easy to meet
We're all water in this vast, vast ocean
Someday we'll evaporate together

There may not be much difference
Between Eldrige Cleaver and Queen of England
If we bottle their tears

There may not be much difference
Between Manson and the Pope
If we press their smile

There may not be much difference
Between Rockefeller and you
If we hear you sing

There may not be much difference
Between you and me
If we show our dreams

We're all water from different rivers
That's why it's so easy to meet
We're all water in this vast, vast ocean
Someday we'll evaporate together

Invisible Strings,"Woman is the nigger of the world
Yes she is, think about it
Woman is the nigger of the world
Think about it, do something about it

We make her paint her face and dance
If she won't be aslave, we say that she don't love us
If she's real, we say she's trying to be a man
While putting her down we pretend that she is above us
Woman is the nigger of the world, yes she is
If you don't believe me take a look to the one you're with
Woman is the slave to the slaves
Ah yeah, better scream about it
We make her bear and raise our children
And then we leave her flat for being a fat old mother hen
We tell her home is the only place she should be
Then we complain that she's too unworldly to be our friend
Woman is the nigger of the world, yes she is
If you don't believe me take a look to the one you're with
Oh woman is the slave to the slaves
Yeah, alright

We insult her everyday on TV
And wonder why she has no guts or confidence
When she's young we kill her will to be free
While telling her not to be so smart we put her down for being so dumb
Woman is the nigger of the world, yes she is
If you don't believe me take a look to the one you're with
Woman is the slave to the slaves
Yes she is, if you believe me, you better scream about it

Inviting the Crash,"Sometimes the snow comes down in June
Sometimes the sun goes 'round the moon
I see the passion in your eyes
Sometimes it's all a big surprise
'Cause there was a time when all I did was wish
You'd tell me this was love
It's not the way I hoped or how I planned
But somehow it's enough

And now we're standing face to face
Isn't this world a crazy place
Just when I thought our chance had passed
You go and save the best for last

All of the nights you came to me
When some silly girl had set you free
You wondered how you'd make it through
I wondered what was wrong with you

'Cause how could you give your love to someone else
And share your dreams with me
Sometimes the very thing you're looking for
Is the one thing you can't see

And now we're standing face to face
Isn't this world a crazy place
Just when I thought our chance had passed
You go and save the best for last

Sometimes the very thing you're looking for
Is the one thing you can't see

Sometimes the snow comes down in June
Sometimes the sun goes 'round the moon
Just when I thought our chance had passed
You go and save the best for last

You went and saved the best for last",Save the Best for Last,2006
Invocation of Nehek,"Is this the day I forget you face?
Or maybe tomorrow when we ride the breeze of steel pins
It's never as easy as I remember
Burn everything that bears my name
And let me drift away from you
Forget those nights of twisted obsessions and bloody tears
And these scars of serial killer lust
It's those words I wrote to you that scream in disbelief
A wayward glance and a forgotten smile
I've seen this paradise die before

Walking between our end and the crashing surf
My regrets disappear with the cherubs
Unbind my hands from razor wire guilt
This drowning man sees what burns behind your eyes
Watch me grow and wither in those dreams of yours
Sleep tight and awaken to my absence
I certainly haven't forgotten your face
And I don't think I ever will",Mona Lisa,2004
Invocation of Nehek,"Take this phrase and bury it beneath you
No more battered faces and forgotten tongues
It seems you've renewed my faith in hate
I'm not as exacting as I once was
I've forgotten what those words meant to me
And your face looks a little dirtier now
Face down in this puddle presents breathing problems
Looks like you're not so righteous now
Just one more minute, that's all I ask
Then you will resurface and wipe away that masquera
A razorblade smile for all those tears
An ear-to-ear grin must have found it's home on you
Porcelain white skin wrapped in bloodstained carpet
Maybe this river will wash away all your demons
Maybe they will stay to hurt you until I come to meet you
Then I will have the chance to do it all over again...
",Porcelain,2004

With the look in her eye
Raised on leather
With flesh on her mind

Words as weapons

You've got dead flowers on the floor

Touch me and I will follow in your afterglow
Heal me from all this sorrow
As I let you go I will find my way, I will sacrifice

I stand alone.

Deep in the valley night begins to grow,
The memory, the best of me,
From out the shadows something takes my hand,
To lead me homeward through a foreign land,
The silence grown, the palest eyes,
I'm the only one.

A mother's son, a father's pride,
How can I run and where to hide?
I close my eyes and hope tonight,
My healing flesh will be all right;
A baby cries, another ghost,
A different side to claim the most,
My blood gone black and down to dust,
So save my soul or let me die,
I'm still alive.

Shaken down, lovely but cockeyed,
No wonder I feel nervous,

Is gathering but never growing old,

Oh what else can I do now?

All come to practice their party pieces,
Pounding like metal from side to side,
To shoot, to save,
And risk that horizon,
No smoke can shield, it stays unhealed,
Safe in our stillness,
At last we see him rise from out the earth.

I set the silhouette that leaves me scarred,
Lost my condition from the perfect star,
I caught the fire, can't help but see,
There's none to carry on.

We mean this little Swiss miss

While down in the valley below (Ho-ho)
Lived a boy who loved her so (Ho-ho)
He loved her with all his might
He loved her day and night

And every night just to see this miss
He used to risk his scalp
For the house where she lived was away up high
And the poor guy didn't know how to fly
So he jumped from alp to alp
What a chump (What a chump)
To jump (To jump)
From alp to alp

And then beneath her balcony
He used to stand around and try to make a hit with her
And he would yodel, ""O-lay-eee-tee""
That's the Swiss idea of a melody
And oh, what a yodeling fool was he
He shook a wicked yodel

And one night as he stood there
The lights were very dim
While leaning out too far across her balcony
She fell for him
He sat with his arms around her
Until the night was gone
And here's the way they carried on

He said, ""Dear I think you're just as sweet as you can be
You're like a cake of sweet Swiss chocolate to me""
She said, ""Oh, my loving one, your talk I can't resist
I hope you're as steady as the Swiss watch ticking on your wrist""
He said, ""How I yearn for you, I burn for you, I do! I do!
Oh, lady, oh, I swear it on my knees
My love for you is just as strong as a piece of Sweitzer cheese""",Swiss Miss,1992

But if you smile on me, all the clouds will roll away.

Ira Gershwin,"When the mellow moon begins to beam,
Every night I dream a little dream,
And of course Prince Charming is the theme,
The he for me.
Although I realize as well as you
It is seldom that a dream comes true,
To me it's clear
That he'll appear.

Some day he'll come along,
The man I love
And he'll be big and strong,
The man I love
And when he comes my way
I'll do my best to make him stay.

He'll look at me and smile
I'll understand,
And in a little while,
He'll take my hand,
And though it seems absurd,
I know we both won't say a word

Maybe I shall meet him Sunday
Maybe Monday, maybe not,
Still I'm sure to meet him one day
Maybe Tuesday will be my good news day

He'll build a little home
Just meant for two,
From which I'll never roam,
Who would, would you?
And so all else above
I'm waiting for the man I love.",The Man I Love,1997

Out of town were the people I knew
I had that feeling of self pity

The outlook was decidedly blue
But as I walked through the foggy streets alone
It turned out to be the luckiest day I've known

A foggy day in London town
It had me low and it had me down
I viewed the morning with much alarm
The British museum had lost its charm
How long, I wondered, could this thing last?
But the age of miracles hadn't passed
For, suddenly, I saw you there
And through foggy London town

Touching your hand, my heart beats the faster,
All that I want in all of this world is you.

You are the promised kiss of springtime
That makes the lonely winter seem long.
You are the breathless hush of evening
That trembles on the brink of a lovely song.

It makes a cloudy day sunny
Makes a bee think of honey
Just as I think of you

Have you ever felt
A gentle touch and then a kiss
And then and then

For example I go around wanting you
And yet I can't imagine that you want me too",Imagination,2000

Lives a life that isn't necessarily sunny
Likewise, the man who works for fame
There's no guarantee that time won't erase his name

Is the kind that is for girl and boy meant

Better not pout, I'm telling you why

And mail it right away

Something in your eyes I see
Soon begins bewitching me

That you stole from the skies

Too hot to handle
Stars in the night
Blazing their light
Can't hold a candle
To your razzle-dazzle

On a magic carpet ride
Full of butterflies inside

Wanna laugh like a loon

And why I'm so in love with you

Even told the golden daffodils

When lights are low

Music hath charms

Our lips meeting soft and tender

Why shouldn't we surrender

Like the ocean beats upon the sand

I felt a bump and heard an ""Oh, beg your pardon""
Suddenly I saw polka dots and moonbeams
All around a pug-nosed dream

The music started and was I the perplexed one
I held my breath and said ""May I have the next one?""
In my frightened arms, polka dots and moonbeams
Sparkled on a pug-nosed dream

There were questions in the eyes of other dancers
As we floated over the floor
There were questions but my heart knew all the answers
And perhaps a few things more

Never such a happy pair

Everybody must excuse us
If we walk on air

All the shadows now will lose us
Lucky stars are everywhere

As a happy being
Here's what I'm foreseeing

For you, for me, forever more
It's bound to be forever more

It's plain to see
We found, by finding each other
The love we waited for

I'm yours, you're mine
And in our hearts
The happy ending starts

This world will be
With a world of love in store
For you, for me, forever more.

That love would turn the trick to end despair

And I noticed there wasn't a chair 

I sat on a rug biding my time 
Drinking her wine 
We talked until two and then she said 
""It's time for bed"" 

She told me she worked 
In the morning and started to laugh 
I told her I didn't

Lead them to conclude that for them life is not the way

You should talk it over to Him

When you feel your life's too hard
Just go have a talk with God

Many of us feel we walk alone without a friend
Never communicating with the One who lives within
Forgetting all about the One who never ever lets you down
And you can talk to him anytime He's always around
When you feel your life's too hard
Just go have a talk with God

Well He's the only free psychiatrist that's known throughout the world

Scusa rispondi
Mi hanno detto che sei qui in questi giorni
Quanto costa avere un paio di notti?
Nella foto mi han colpito i tuoi occhi

Vieni che ti aspetto questa sera
Ho chiamato la tua amica l'altra sera
Ma l'ho vista poi le ho detto ""Un'altra sera""
Era bianca e io ti preferisco nera

Vieni qui sbrigati
Io mi faccio un altro drink
Non farti troppo bella o poi mi pento

Ma stasera faccio un film
Domani te lo spiego non adesso

Questa sera resto qui

Dai ti vergogni
Siamo qui da più di un'ora, ti spogli?
Non vorrai mica buttare i tuoi soldi
Non ti serve più la scusa degli occhi

Non è un vizio se lo faccio ogni tanto
Ti dispiace se ti chiamo ogni tanto?
Non pensavo mi piacessi così tanto
Se continui giuro mi verrà un infarto

Vieni qui sbrigati
Che se bevo troppi drink
Mi salirà la vodka e poi non riesco

Quel vestito attira troppo gli sguardi
E poi com'è che ci cammini in quei tacchi?
Sì, stasera posso dirti solamente che
Giuro, la prossima volta andrà meglio
Non è colpa mia, è che sono un po' stanco

Davanti una fabbrica
Con la radio spenta mentre l'alba si avvicina e

Non fermarti, è andata via
Fare quella cosa non ti piace, ma dai piace a me
Fingere un poco di gelosia
Pur sapendo che sei mia
Farlo solo perché sai mi piace tanto quanto a te

Giovani, coi vizi da adulti e una faccia da schiaffi
Perché siamo giovani
Con gli occhi imbevuti di rabbia ma senza un perché
Siamo noi che scriviamo la storia
Siamo noi ladri di pelle d'oca

Scopano dentro una macchina
Due bicchieri in plastica
Pieni di poesie di frasi scelte a caso da un bel film
Fingere di avere una teoria
Sull'amore, le droghe
Sui soldi che tanto non portano altro che bugie perfette
Noi che non vogliamo niente su un sedile scosso dalle turbolenze
Ricchi solo di esperienze
Non stare qui a pensarci se cazzo ti amo un po'

Siamo noi che scriviamo la storia
Siamo noi ladri di pelle d'oca
Giovani con meno carte
Come fossero in disparte
Senza nodi alle cravatte
Ma con nodi in gola
Giovani, giovani come noi

Siamo noi che scriviamo la storia
Siamo noi ladri di pelle d'oca
Vadano a fanculo i figli intellettuali
Pieni di giudizi in tasca
Noi che la cultura prima la facciamo
Mica la leggiamo e basta

E una voglia di rivalsa

Non mi importa cosa credono di me
Ora che tutti mi cercano per stare insieme
Il mio nome viene molto prima di me
Dove eravate quando mi chiudevo in casa giorni?
Quando mi rimangiavo i sogni?
Quando uno stronzo con la giacca mi spiegava l'arte
Dentro un ufficio che puzzava solamente di soldi?
E dentro il mio letto un'altra donna scrive
Dal suo telefono chissà a chi scrive
Se glielo chiedo tanto non lo dice
Dai non fare storie, su come si dice
La paranoia mi sotterra dolcemente
Con una mano stringe piano piano le mie tempie
Mentre le bacio il ventre mi dice solamente
Che è una ragazza seria e le è successo raramente, se

Non sono neanche un montato, non lo sono mai stato
Non sono un cazzo di rapper, non lo sono mai stato
Non ho bisogno di far l'idolo per qualche sfigato
La credibilità di strada ficcatela nel culo
Che ai diciasette quasi ci crepavo, ancora ci sudo
Non ho mai fatto questa roba per piacere a qualcuno
Ed ora che sono al primo posto non mi sento nessuno
Calmo, piango, penso a Rolex, tanto

Quante notte mi hai aspettato sopra un marciapiede al freddo
Quel secchio era il tuo piedistallo
Tu avresti abbandonato tutto per darmi il tuo bene
Per darmi tutto quanto

Una volta scoperti ci ammazzassero entrambi

E mi rinchiuse per entrare in una scuola
Come un albero ad uscire come un palo della luce

Quanto fumo in una macchina che va
Da un silenzio imbarazzante nascerà un ricordo
Quello che mi vorresti dire ti si legge in volto
Tutti coi giubbotti in pelle come i punk

Ti rivedi in me, forse dallo sguardo
Tu cresciuto in paese, io cresciuto in città
Tu domenica in chiesa mentre io prego in un pub
E forse Dio non fa per me
Forse questa vita non fa per me
Mentre qualche amico si fa per tre
Si accontenta di un lavoro che non è un granché
E io ci credo ancora

And no one is in need
There are no guns, no bombs, no diseases
No hungry mouths to feed
From a distance we are instruments
Marching in a common band
Playing songs of home, playing songs of peace
They're the songs of every man
God is watching us, God is watching us
God is watching us from a distance
From a distance you look like my friend
Even though we are at war
From a distance I can't comprehend
What all this war is for
From a distance there is harmony
And it echoes through the land
It's the hope of hopes, it's the love of loves
It's the heart of every man
It's the hope of hopes, It's the love of loves
It's the song of every man

And a hand to hold when leaves begin to fall,
And a love whose burning light to warm the winter night, that's all, that's all.
There are those I am sure who have told you,
They will give you the world for a toy.
All I ask for these arms to enfold you, and a love, time can never destroy.

I know that we will always be this way

I know you were made for me

You are my light
Forever in this light

I thought i knew love before
With you i've found there's so much more
More than the love we make
It's the feelings we two can explore
We're just a woman and a man
We'll make mistakes like we all can.
But through it all, you'll see
By your side i will be
Growing closer to you each passing day.

can't repeat the mistakes

Irene Carroll,"When I take you out, tonight, with me,
Honey, here's the way it's goin' to be:
You will set behind a team of snow white horses,
In the slickest gig you ever see!

Chicks and ducks and geese better scurry
When I take you out in the surrey,
When I take you out in the surrey with the fringe on top!
Watch that fringe and see how it flutters
When I drive them high steppin' strutters.
Nosey pokes'll peek thru' their shutters and their eyes will pop!
The wheels are yeller, the upholstery's brown,
The dashboard's genuine leather,
With isinglass curtains y' can roll right down,
In case there's a change in the weather.
Two bright sidelight's winkin' and blinkin',
Ain't no finer rig I'm a-thinkin'
You can keep your rig if you're thinkin' 'at I'd care to swap
Fer that shiny, little surrey with the fringe on the top!

Would y' say the fringe was made a' silk?

Wouldn't have n' other kind but silk.

Has it really got a team of snow white horses?

One's like snow,
the others more like milk.

All the world'll fly in a flurry
When I take you out in the surrey,
When I take you out in the surrey with the fringe on top!
When we hit that road, hell fer leather,
Cats and dogs'll dance in the heather,
Birds and frogs'll sing all together and the toads will hop!
The wind'll whistle as we rattle along,
The cows'll moo in the clover,
The river will ripple out a whispered song,
And whisper it over and over:
Don't you wisht y'd go on forever?
Don't you wisht y'd go on forever?
Don't you wisht y'd go on forever and ud never stop
In that shiny, little surrey with the fringe on the top!

I can see the stars gettin' blurry,
When we ride back home in the surrey,
Ridin' slowly home in the surrey with the fringe on top!
I can feel the day gettin' older,
Feel a sleepy head near my shoulder,
Noddin', droopin' close to my shoulder, till it falls kerplop!
The sun is swimmin' on the rim of a hill;
The moon is takin' a header,
And jist as I'm thinkin' all the earth is still,
A lark'll wake up in the medder.
Hush, you bird, my baby's a-sleepin'!
Maybe got a dream worth a-keepin'
Whoa! you team, and just keep a-creepin' at a slow clip clop.
Don't you hurry with the surrey with the fringe on the top!",The Surrey With The Fringe On Top,1964
Irene Coloso,"Lately, I have had the strangest feeling
With no vivid reason here to find
Yet the thought of losing you's been hanging 'round my mind 
Far more frequently you're wearing perfume
With you say no special place to go
But when I ask will you be coming back soon
You don't know, never know 
Well, I'm a man of many wishes
Hope my premonition misses
But what I really feel my eyes won't let me hide
'Cause they always start to cry
'Cause this time could mean goodbye 
Lately I've been staring in the mirror
Very slowly picking me apart
Trying to tell myself I have no reason with your heart 
Just the other night while you were sleeping
I vaguely heard you whisper someone's name
But when I ask you of the thoughts your keeping
You just say nothing's changed 
Well, I'm a man of many wishes
I hope my premonition misses
But what I really feel my eyes won't let me hide
'Cause they always start to cry
'Cause this time could mean goodbye, goodbye

E senza un perché

Vedo barche sassi e stelle
Case bianche anche lassù

Lasciato dal blu
E una donna in riva al mare
Mentre il sole va giù
Che con la mano saluta
I sogni che passano
E lascia una scia
Che non va più via nell’alta marea

Dimmi dove si nasconde
La promessa libertà
Questi fiori fra le onde
Chiedono pietà
Non più guerre e religioni
Ma un’altra vita un sogno in più

È bisogno d'amore

Irene Kral,"Once I was a sentimental thing
Throw my heart away each Spring
Now a Spring romance
Hasn't got a chance
Promised my first dance to Winter
All I've got to show's a splinter
For my little fling

Spring, this year has got me feeling like a horse
That never left the post
I lay in my room
Starring up at the ceiling
Spring can really hang you up the most

Morning kiss wakes trees and flower
And to them my life
To drink a toast I walk in the park
Just to kill those lonely hours
Spring can really hang you up the most

All afternoon
Those birds tweet-a-tweet I know their tune
This is love this is it
Heard it before
And I know the score
And I decide that love is a bore
Love seem sure around the new year
Now it's April

Love is just a ghost
Spring arrived on time
But what became of you, dear
Spring can really hang you up the most
Spring can really hang you up the most

Spring is here
There's no mistaken
Robins build their nest from coast to coast
My heart tries the same
So they won't hear it breaking
Spring can really hang you up the most

College boys are riding somewhere
Tender passion there it grows
But I'm on the shelf with last years Easter bonnet
Spring can really hang you up the most

Love came my way
I'm holding the last
We had our day
Now that's all in the past
Spring came along
A season of song
For love's sweet promise
But something went wrong
Doctor's once prescribed a tonic
Sulfur and molasses was the dose
Didn't help me a bit
My condition must be chronic
Spring can really hang you up the most

All alone, the party's over
Winter was a gracious host
But when you keep praying
For snow to hide the clover
Spring can really hang you up the most",Spring Can Really Hang You up the Most,1997

Has the murmuring sound of may
All silver bells, coral shells, carousels
And the laughter of children at play

Two lovers alone and out of sight
Seeing images in the firelight
As my eyes visualize a family

Never were, really are, nearly are?

Through the perishing
Winter nights and days,
A funny little phrase
That means so much to me,
That you've got to be
With me heart and soul,
For on you the whole thing leans.

Come with me and leave the noisy crowds,
Sunlight shines for us above the clouds.

And you,
And no-one to worry us,
No one to hurry us through

And try
To guess what it's all about,
Then we will figure out why
The world is round!

We'll be as happy and contented as birds upon a tree,
High above the mountains and the sea.

We'll bill and we'll coo-ooo-oo,
And sorrow will never come,
Oh, will it ever come true,
Our room with a view?

A room with a view,
And you,
And no-one to give advice,
That sounds like a paradise few
Could fail to choose.

With fingers entwined,
We'll find
Relief from the preachers
Who always beseech us to mind
Our P's and Q's.

We'll watch the whole world pass before us while we are sitting still,
Leaning on our own window sill.

And trying awfully hard to make my tears behave
But that's quite impossible, I'm still in love with you.

I primi tempi andava a letto alle sette
Chiamava a casa dal call center
Ora stringe le tette sotto mezze magliette strette
Cambia guerra cambia città
Suo figlio si confonde ha troppi papà
A casa sua si prendeva una televisione
Raccontava di un paese allegro e caciarone
Poi è venuta qui e ha visto la bugia
La perversione che c’è dietro sta scenografia
La sottile linea sporca tra marca e marchetta
Di un paese che di notte la cerca e di giorno l’arresta
Una sbornia di vodka le ricorda la Bosnia
Abbiamo l’Hollywood ma non la California
E questo è un film con produttore pappone
Uguale come in paullese col bidone",Tre Paperelle,2009
Irene Woodsprod,"A dream is a wish your heart makes
When you're fast asleep
In dreams you will loose your heartache
Whatever you wish for, you keep

Have faith in your dreams and someday
Your rainbow will come smiling through
No matter how your heart is grieving
If you keep on believing
The dream that you wish will come true

Oh, that clock!
Oh, killjoy
I hear you, come on, get up you say
Time to start another day
Even he orders me around
Well, there's one thing
They can't order me to stop dreaming
And perhaps someday
The dreams that I wish will come true

No matter how your heart is grieving
If you keep on believing
The dream that you wish will come true",A Dream Is a Wish Your Heart Makes [From Cinderella],2013

Bring us back, bring us back
To our very first breath, very first breath
Bring us back, bring us back
Bring us back, bring us back
To our very first breath, very first breath

Nothing’s been the same since we’ve been through
Walking in the rain, calling your name in my sleep
Never thought you’d run so deep
In the corners of my mind you creep
Practicing my aim deep within you
Poison in my veins, all cause of the things that you do
At first I thought it couldn’t be true
Never thought I would plead you to

Hold me, tight in your thoughts
Bring us back, bring us back
Bring us back, bring us back
To the second we met
You told me, we would get lost
Bring us back, bring us back
Bring us back, bring us back
To our very first breath

Somewhere in the mist I can see you
Hanging on a kiss, dreaming of a time gone by
When we wouldn't let each other die
Wake up and we would touch the sky
If my only wish ever came true
I'd hang on to your lips
Like that shining drop of golden sweat
How could I ever forget to

Hold you, tight in my thoughts
Bring us back, bring us back
To the second we met
I told you we would get caught
Bring us back, bring us back
Bring us back, bring us back
To our very first breath

Bring us back, bring us back
Bring us back, bring us back
To our very first breath, very first breath
Bring us back, bring us back
Bring us back, bring us back
To our very first breath, bring us back
Bring us back, bring us back

No my only wish never came true

Muito fogo na cabeça pensando sobre o pensar

Your my bright light at the end of the line 
And I'm your brave knight that will ride in your size 
So lets go 
Don't wanna get left behind 
Go see Keshia fine, I got nothing to hide 
Your my cherry on top through my ups and downs 
And I'm your friend you got when others don't come round 
You know, not in a rush I'm gonna do you slow 
This songs not for the ears, but the heart and soul 
Your my sunshine, rainbows, pots of gold 
And I'm your warm touch, when times are cold 
Your my good luck charm, only good things unfold 
My sweet little rose I'm just letting you know

And when your gone all the clouds seem grey 
But somehow you bring the sun my way, always 
Your my lady in the place 
Who lights up the place

And withh you Ima chill, change ways of old 
And when I'm on the road, you know my hearts at home 
Thats us, You and I, all our problems solved

Kun korjauskelvottomia mun vaurioni ois
Jos kohtalo ois julma ja veis aurinkoni pois
Ollaan toisillemme pelastavan köyden päät

Jäätyis jaloistansa kiinni ku siin biisis, se ois siin sit

Awake
Watching you run through my head
I'm alone again, but not for long my friend

We face another day
And distance has come and taken you far away again
But I'll see you soon my friend
And then I'll sing you my song

I cant go home alone again
No I cant
My friend
Until then

Eyes, I recognize
Taking me back
Familiar to me from some other time
Or maybe another life.

Remember our times, and know who I am
The memory stays, until we can breathe as one again
And I'm coming back my friend
And then I'll sing you my song

Oh yeah
And I cant go home alone again
No I cant go home all alone again
No I cant go home all alone again
No I cant

And I can't go home alone again
No I cant go home all alone again
No I cant go home all alone again
No I cant

Irio de Paula,"Speak low when you speak, love,
Our summer day withers away
Too soon, too soon.

Speak low when you speak, love,
Our moment is swift, like ships adrift,
We're swept apart too soon.

Speak low, darling speak low,
Love is a spark lost in the dark,
Too soon, too soon,
I feel wherever I go
That tomorrow is near, tomorrow is here
And always too soon.

Time is so old and love so brief,
Love is pure gold and time a thief.
We're late darling, we're late,

Too soon, too soon,
I wait darling, I wait
Will you speak low to me,
Speak love to me and soon.",Speak Low,2002

A second of your time to tell you how

I turned me eyes up to the sky and I prayed ""Please help me, Lord,
You know I've sowed my wild oats and now the fun's all gone""

And I put them in my song:

""Infamous Angel come on home
To someone who loves you and knows you needed to roam
Grab your things, a ticket's waiting at the bus depot
For: Infamous Angel, Destination: Home""

I heard heaven's choir rejoicing as the tears broke from my eyes
And all at once it lifted the weight from my past life
I found a pen and I left a note on the dresser drawer
""Infamous Angel, she don't live here anymore""

To someone who loves you and knows you needed to roam
Grab your things, a ticket's waiting at the bus depot

I went flying down two flights of stairs 'til on the street I stood
And there I took that final look at my old neighborhood
Then I ran down the street proclaiming ""Angel gone for good""

Well, go on I gotta kiss you goodbye but I'll hold to my lover

You'll be waiting at the track
You're having troubles sleeping nights
And you want me to come back
That old train just rolls on by
You're gonna know I never came
'cause I sleep good and I miss a lot of trains

I sleep good and I miss a lot of trains
That one-way trek to no man's love
I will never ride again
I used to lie awake like you
Just calling out your name
But now I sleep good and I miss a lot of trains

You're standing in the station
I can see you in my mind
You think that I'll return again
But you're so wrong this time
Your sleepless eyes and selfish heart
Will be waiting there in vain
While I sleep good and I miss a lot of trains

Now I'm a grown woman but my thoughts are still wild
I thought I'd seen London or maybe Paris
But I'm starin' at cornfields and they're starin' at me

But dreams are just things that keep in a jar
You bury your dreams or you wish on a star
For an ocean line ticket back to where you were born
Away from these hard times and the acres of corn

Every now and again I take a small drink
From the blackberry brandy hidden under the sink
And I pull out that steam trunk and put on my gown
And I waltz through these cornfields 'til I fall to the ground

But dreams are just things that you keep in a trunk
'til the men are out workin' or you've gone a bit drunk
Then you unlock your dreams, but they're tattered and worn
So you stare out the window at the acres of corn

Dreams are just things that keep in a jar
You bury your dreams or you wish on a star

Iris DeMent,"Riding east-bound freight train, stealing through the night
He was just a lonesome hobo who was fighting for his life
The sadness in his eyes revealed the torture of his soul
As he raised a weak and weary hand to brush away the cold

Outside the rain is falling on that lonely boxcar door,
But the little frame of Hobo Bill lay still upon the floor
As the train sped through the darkness and the raging storm outside
No one knew that Hobo Bill was taking his last ride

He was a lonesome hobo

No warm lights flickered 'round him no blankets were there to fold
There was nothing but the howling wind and the driving rain so cold
As he heard a whistle blowing in a dreamy kind of way
The hobo seemed contented for he smiled there where he lay

It was early in the morning when they raised the hobo's head
The smile still lingered on his face, though Hobo Bill was dead
There was no one there to weep for him or soothe his weary soul
For he was just a hobo who had died out in the cold

He was a lonesome hobo

And I am never invited
Now I am here, talking to you
No wonder I get excited

Your smile, and the sound of your voice
And the way you see through me
Got a feeling, you give me no choice
But it means a lot to me
So I wanna know
       
What's the name of the game?  (Your smile and the sound of your voice)
Does it mean anything to you? (Got a feeling you give me no choice)
(But it means a lot)
What's the name of the game? (Your smile and the sound of your voice)
Can you feel it the way I do?
Tell me please, 'cause I have to know
I'm a bashful child, beginning to grow

And you make me talk
And you make me feel
And you make me show
What I'm trying to conceal
If I trust in you, would you let me down?
Would you laugh at me, if I said I care for you?
Could you feel the same way too?
I wanna know
Oh yes I wanna know

The name of the game  (I was an impossible case)
Does it mean anything to you?  (But I think I can see in your face)
(That it means a lot)

That pit-a-pats through my brain;
So darn persistent,
The day isn't distant
When it'll drive me insane.
Comes in the morning
Without any warning,
And hangs around me all day.
I'll have to sneak up to it
Someday, and speak up to it.

Fascinating rhythm,
You've got me on the go!

What a mess you're making!

Why I'm always shaking

Start a-hopping,
Never stopping 
To find at night no work has been done.

I know that
Once it didn't matter 
But now you're doing wrong;
When you start to patter
I'm so unhappy.

Won't you take a day off?

And make it snappy!

It was blue as ink

I remember snow

Sharp as thumb tacks
Coming down like lint
And it made you squint
When the wind would blow

And ice like vinyl
On the streets
Cold as silver
White as sheets
Rain like strings
And changing things
Like leaves

I remember leaves
Green as spearmint
Crisp as paper
I remember trees
Bare as coat racks
Spread like broken umbrellas

And parks and bridges
Ponds and zoos
Ruddy faces
Muddy shoes
And light and noise and
Bees and boys
And days

I remember days
Or at least I try
But as years go by
They're a sort of haze
And the bluest ink
Isn't really sky
And at times I think
I would gladly die
For a day of sky",I Remember Sarah,2001

One look is all you'd need to see the mood I'm in.
Perhaps then you'd realize I'm still in love with you.
If you could see me now, you'd find me being brave
And trying awfully hard to make my tears behave
But that's quite impossible, I'm still in love with you.
 
You'll happen my way on some mem'rable day
And the month will be May for a while.
I'll try to smile but can I play the part

That's the kind of magic 
Music we make with our lips when we kiss

And there's a weepy old willow
He really knows how to cry
That's how I'd cry in my pillow

When you and I
Had surely reached the end
Still here we are
The flame as strong as ever
All because we both kept holding on
We know we can weather any storm
Baby, that's what love is all about
Two hearts that find a way, somehow
To keep the fire burning
It's something we could never live without
It it takes forever
We can work it out
Beyond a shadow of a doubt
Baby, that's what love is all about
As time goes by
We've learned to rediscover
The reason why
This dream of our survives
Through thick and thin
We're destined for each other
Knowing we can reach the other side
Far beyond the mountains of our pride
Ridin' the good times is easy
The hard times can tear you apart
There'll be times in your heart
When the feelin' is gone
But ya keep on believing
And ya keep holdin' on

I just came up in time
Was teaching the lawyers and the doctors
That a man ain't nothing but his mind


Won't somebody tell me
Answer if you can
Won't somebody tell me
Tell me what is the soul of a man?


I read the Bible often
I try to read it right
As far as I can understand
It's nothing but a burning light


Won't somebody tell me
Answer if you can
Won't somebody tell me
Tell me what is the soul of a man?


When Christ taught in the temple
The people all stood amazed
Was teaching the lawyers and the doctors
How to raise a man from the grave


Won't somebody tell me

Won't somebody tell me
Tell me what is the soul of a man?

Muddy hymnals
And some boot marks where you'd been

The righteous suffer in a fallen land
And pulled the shade
To keep the crowd from peeking in

We found your children by the tavern door
With wooden buttons and an apple core
Playing house
And telling everyone you'd drowned

The begging choir told the captain's man
We all assume the worst the best we can
And for a round or two
They'd gladly track you down

We found you sleeping by your lover's stone

Our last of days
And grace the game with a blindfold on
The cheaters came to play
And outside the soft-handed boys
Screaming cars and all their speed
Music, meth, a hero beggin change
His sword across his knees

and how he prays to find a man to blame
For every sleepless night he spends
And for every well that he warned me of
But wound up falling in
And then for the kids beneath the balcony
Who disregard the rain
To make sure the king won't grant
The dead man one more day

let's go out and see darling
What shines tonight
And temper your dream about the dying horse
With traffic, noise, and light
And somewhere the soft-handed boys,
Bleeding hearts, and worker bees
Give to the holy mother begging change
Christ across her knees

and oh how she prays to find a man to blame
For every loveless night she waits
And for every gun that she frowned upon
But still some fucker made
And then for the kid beneath the balcony
Behind the garbage can
Who waits for the king to come
And hold his sweating hand

He never wanted nothing I remember 
Maybe a broken bottle if I had two 
Hanging behind his holy even temper 
Hiding the more unholy things I do

Jesus the Mexican boy 
Born in a truck on the 4th of July

Hanging behind his holy even temper

And she's chosen to believe in the hymns her mother sings
Sunday pulls its children from the piles of fallen leaves

There are sailing ships that pass all our bodies in the grass
Springtime calls her children until she let's them go at last
And she's chosen where to be, though she's lost her wedding ring
Somewhere near her misplaced jar of Bougainvillea seeds

There are things we can't recall, Blind as night that finds us all
Winter tucks her children in, her fragile china dolls
But my hands remember hers, rolling around the shaded ferns
Naked arms, her secrets still like songs I'd never learned

Happily
By the rosebush laughing
With bruises on my chin
The time when
We counted every black car passing
Your house beneath the hill
And up until
Someone caught us in the kitchen
With maps, a mountain range,
A piggy bank
A vision too removed to mention
But

Please, remember me
Fondly
I heard from someone you're still pretty
And then
They went on to say
That the pearly gates
Had some eloquent graffiti
Like 'We'll meet again'
And 'Fuck the man'
And 'Tell my mother not to worry'
And angels with their gray
Handshakes
Were always done in such a hurry
And

Please, remember me
At Halloween
Making fools of all the neighbors
Our faces painted white
By midnight
We'd forgotten one another
And when the morning came
I was ashamed
Only now it seems so silly
That season left the world
And then returned
And now you're lit up by the city
So

Please, remember me
Mistakenly
In the window of the tallest tower call
Then pass us by
But much too high
To see the empty road at happy hour
Leave and resonate
Just like the gates
Around the holy kingdom
With words like 'Lost and Found' and 'Don't Look Down'
And 'Someone Save Temptation'
And

Please, remember me
As in the dream
We had as rug-burned babies
Among the fallen trees
And fast asleep
Aside the lions and the ladies
That called you what you like
And even might
Give a gift for your behavior
A fleeting chance to see
A trapeze
Swing as high as any savior
But

Please, remember me
My misery
And how it lost me all I wanted
Those dogs that love the rain
And chasing trains
The colored birds above there running
In circles round the well
And where it spells
On the wall behind St. Peter's
So bright with cinder gray
And spray paint
'Who the hell can see forever?'
And

Please, remember me
Seldomly
In the car behind the carnival
My hand between your knees
You turn from me
And said 'The trapeze act was wonderful
But never meant to last'
The clown that passed
Saw me just come up with anger
When it filled with circus dogs
The parking lot
Had an element of danger
So

Please, remember me
Finally
And all my uphill clawing
My dear
But if I make
The pearly gates
Do my best to make a drawing

A monkey and a man

For the spider bites
And all your love as we were
We were born to fuck each other
One way or another
But I'll only lie
Down by the waterside at night

I will collect a million years
And you can blame me
Blame me, I will wear it

With bullets and pages of trade magazines

Then flew up her gown and that?s how she knows
That God made her eyes for crying at birth

And every summer there was imminent rain
The late judge teetered in a john boat

And the moon blooms
All shining
As we dragged our panic
Up and down the riverbed
Sweating wild and weird

Jenny was gone

And the rain came howling
Out of Virginia
Blue tick blowing the water
Out her nose

Jenny and me in the front row
And singing about how heaven calls
The kingdom of the animals all
And all revealed to us one day

Jenny and me on the hilltop
And peeking at all their upturned bottles
Jumping like leopards
Jaw hearp teasing the brushfire in its rage

Jenny came back
And the wet road still shining in our eyes
An angel clear and coronal
Clothed in all that's prodigal and strange

Jenny came back
And I thought that I heard her
Murmur something about

Spat on the ground
Like a letter tossed away

And turning over
Just where heaven calls
The kingdom of the animals

They're drinking up and walking and it is time for me to slide

Where the earth is strung with lover's pearls and all I see are dark eyes.

A cock is crowing far away and another soldier's deep in prayer
Some mother's child has gone astray, she can't find him anywhere
But I hear another rum beating for the dead that rise
Whom nature's beast fear as they come and all I see are dark eyes.

They tell me to be discreet for all intended purposes
They tell me revenge is sweet, I'm sure it is
But I feel nothing for their game, where beauty goes unrecognized
All I feel is heat and flame, and all I see are dark eyes.

By the pool, they would protest
With crosses 'round their necks,
But our sons were overseas,
And we all know about the hive and the honey bees.

Almost home

You were beating on a Persian rug
With your Bible and your wedding band
Both hidden on the TV stand.

Off the county carousel

While your grieving girls all died in their sleep,
So the dogs all went unfed,

And said, ""Please, before I go
May your only honor bought
Be the kinship of the kids in the riot squad.""",Carousel,2007

Abel got a telephone
And even the last of the blue-eyed babies know
That the burning man is the color of the end of day

Cain bought a blade from some witch at the window
Abel bought a bag of weed
And the even the last of the brown-eyed babies see

That the cartoon king has a tattoo of a bleeding heart
There ain't a penthouse Christian that wants the pain or the scab, but they all want the scar
How every mouth sings of what it's without so we all sing of love
And how it ain't one dog who's good at fucking and denying who he's thinking of

Cain heard the captive boy leap off the rooftop
Abel heard his papa pray
And even the last of the black-eyed babies say
That every saint has a chair you can borrow in a church to sit on

That the wind blows cold across the back of a master and the kitchen help
There's a big pile of innocent bones still holding up the garden wall
And it was always the broken hand we learned to lean on after all

In a frozen copse of trees

The shiny blades of pagan angels in our father's skies
Every evening I would watch her hold the pillow
Tight against her hollows, her unholy child

I was still a beggar shaking out my stolen coat
Among the angry cemetery leaves
When they caught the king beneath the borrowed car
Righteous, drunk, and fumbling for the royal keys

Love was a father's flag and sung like a shank
In a cake on our leather boots
A beautiful feather floating down
To where the birds had shit on empty chapel pews

Every morning we found one more machine
To mock our ever waning patience at the well
Every evening she'd descend the mountain stealing socks
And singing something good where all the horses fell

Like a snake within the wilted garden wall
I'd hint to her every possibility

Like our ghosts will live

When sister Laurie says ""Amen""
We won't hear anything

That fledgling bird

And the falling house across the way
It'll keep everything
The baby's breath, our bravery wasted
And our shame

And we'll undress beside the ashes of the fire
Both our tender bellies bound in baling wire
All the more a pair of underwater pearls
Than the oak tree and its Resurrection Fern

In our days we will say
What our ghosts will say
We gave the world what it saw fit
But what'd we get?

We'll see everything
In the timid shade of the autumn leaves
