The Swellers,"Everyone's an animal somewhere within.
Some are parasites, but looks can be deceiving.
Weak, they drag the others and their pride down with.
We're taught to run and hide, until we start believing.

Face your design, open your mind.

[Chorus]
When you're broken you will know
On the inside
Do you feel like you'll explode,
On the inside?
And when you think that you've found hate
On the inside
Don't forget we're all the same
On the inside
Ever since the day you opened up your eyes,
It's sorted out for you, everything is black and white.
Lying on the pavement staring at the sky,
The pavement knows the truth, we're one under the streetlights.

Wait for a sign, you're out of time.

[Chorus: x2]",The Inside,2005
The Swellers,"You were there from the beginning.
It was then we said,
We'd have each other backs forever.
Our days were never numbered.
We were all best friends.
We always thought that we were never ending.
Then things started changing.
You said it wasn't right,
For you to keep excuses coming
Put out the flame you started.
I should have known it all along.
I knew you'd never be the same,
If you left even for a while.

I know you're leaving for a reason,
But I don't understand what you're thinking.
It's way over my head, again.

We could have kept it going,
But you dropped it all.
You gave up all you ever dreamed of.
There's no going back now.
You fit me like a glove,
But now I'm not sure any glove will fit this time around.
Cause you always looked more blissful in the shade.
Now I see the other face.

I know you're leaving for a reason,
But I don't understand what you're thinking.
It's way over my head, again.

You know it's different now that you're gone.
Maybe it's for the best,
You probably thought you were the only one.

I know you're leaving for a reason,
But I don't understand what you're thinking.
It's way over my head, again.
You know I'd love to know what you found.
Be sure to drop me a line,
Or maybe I'll see you around.",Over and Out,2005
The Swellers,"You said that you hate me now.
You said you never want to see, my face again.
I never said sorry then,
I never kept my promises, like a true friend.

And there you'll be along the way,
Thanks again I appreciate it everyday.
And then I'll say the thing I've always said
And throw it all away.

You can let go now, and I swear that I won't run.
I'll be just fine.
I'll take it from here.
I quit staring at the sun,
For good this time.

You said I'm impossible.
You said you wish that I could feel, what you been through.
I said I'm not feeling this.
I guess I have some growing up to do with you.

And there you'll be along the way,
Thanks again I appreciate it everyday.
And then do the thing I've always done
And throw it all away.

You can let go now, and I swear that I won't run.
I'll be just fine.
I'll take it from here.
I quit staring at the sun,
For good this time.

For good this time.",Run,2005
The Swellers,"The smokestacks cut off all the light.
Polluted skies mean polluted minds.
Keep waiting for a new day.
The masses block out all the signs.
They're taking over without a fight.
Keep waiting for a new day.
Keep waiting for the haze to disappear.
They'll never see a new day.

It never ends, removing grip from idle hands.
It never ends, removing grip from idle hands.

No way to survive on their own.
They'll feed on themselves down to the bone.
Keep waiting for a new day.
A new day that won't ever come.
They're lining pockets till it's all done.
It doesn't have to be this way.
Still living in a state of constant fear.
Try to stop us we're the new wave.

It never ends, removing grip from idle hands.
It never ends, removing grip from idle hands.

We can't ever leave this to die.
We can't ever leave this to die.

It never ends, removing grip from idle hands.
We can't ever leave this to die
We can't ever leave this to die
It never ends, removing grip from idle hands.",They All Float Down Here,2005
The Swellers,"Apparently we are all just hypocrites.
But face it, you're the same,
And you change like seasons change.
Where do you go when everyone is moving on?
The sheep are closing in to follow the whole heard right off a cliff.

We'll watch it pass by in time again.
You say it'll stick but we can't see how.
We'll be the ones still laughing in the end.
It's over now.

So now you're jumping on a new train.
Your previous plans failed, won't be long till this derails.
You're just another face planted in the ground.
You don't have lots to say
Cause you can't think for yourself anyway.

We'll watch it pass by in time again.
You say it'll stick but we can't see how.
We'll be the ones still laughing in the end.
It's over now.

Looking on with tunnel vision.
You can't see anything.
You've got yours and I've got mine.
It's up to you; it's your decision.
We're just living our way, one day at a time. 
We're just living our way, one day at a time.
We're just living our way, one day at a time.",Tunnel Vision,2005
The Swellers,"Everyone is in the gray 
And I don't care if anyone's two faced
I'm sleeping
Don't plan on checking in

I try to greet troubles with apathy
Hello's are never what they used to be
I'm heaving
Help me down the drain
Do you even remember me?
I'm leaving
You're way gone

Constant reminder
Sounds like you need help reminding
Locked on, I'm dead on
Sounds like you need help reminding

All I know is made by human beings 
So I can't put my faith in anything
I'm sleeping
Don't plan on checking in
But I wonder where the hell you've been
I'm leaving
Gone

Constant reminder
Sounds like you need help reminding
I'm locked on, I'm dead on
Sounds like you need reminding

I'm used to breaking bottles when you ruin this
It's what I do
This isn't just goodbye
This is me forgetting you

Constant reminder
Sounds like you need help reminding
Locked on, I'm dead on
Sounds like you need reminding",Bottles,2007
The Swellers,"No more dreams of the southwest
I just got a taste
And a little dust from every state
Caught underneath my shoes
That'll never wash away

I'm no stranger to the rust
We made this with our hands
From a billion other grains of sand
I'd rather have gray skies
Spotlights can burn through any man

Call it a clean slate
Not just a mistake
For all this time, all this time
It may be different
But I don't feel so bad now

There are no promises out there
Maybe I can't see straight
It eventually evaporates
Got a slight change of plans
I'll call some good friends of mine

I'm never going back
Or at least for some time
And first a train off track
I'll come back like an avalanche

Call it a clean slate
Not just a mistake
For all this time, all this time
It may be different
But I don't feel so bad now

I'll find myself
I'll find myself

Call it a clean slate
Not just a mistake
For all this time, all this time
It may be different
But I don't feel so bad now

Call it a clean slate
Not just a mistake
For all this time, all this time
It may be different
But I don't feel so bad now",Clean Slate,2007
The Swellers,"Hey, do you remember me? 
Fuel from the will has never run so well. 
When all the assholes follow suit 
This is my defense, it just makes more sense 
To do less than one is doing now 
Will do more for a goal 
Than anyone can stomach giving up 
Reiterate it one more time 
I'm nothing 

I feel responsibility to say whats on my mind 
This is more than a dream 
Get shit on to give a shit 
The least American 
The new minority 

Then there's you, the pointer boy for truths 
A spark can start it all 
Without your doubt, there's not much we can't do 
Reiterate it one more time 
I'm nothing, I'm nothing 

Find comfort in fiction 
Your story has been incomplete all along 
How safe do you feel with your mind closed?","Conscience, Meet Common Sense",2007
The Swellers,"The flood carries us away
I'll hold my breath for other days

I won't make this wager, where's the light for me
Now that you've raised the stakes?
And they're always waiting. 
Fuck waiting!
My hands are surface bound
The rest stays under water

The flood carries us away
I'll hold my breath for other days
And when I hear that voice and everything's okay
Then I'll pray the world my soul to take

With my philosophy expelled, it'd take a saint to give me hell
And I don't know what's real
I'm deteriorating, the most hated
Drown without a sound
True hearts and minds are sinking

The flood carries us away
I'll hold my breath for other days
And when I hear that voice and everything's okay
Then I'll pray the world my soul to take

Suddenly, it hits me that there's something out there for us
But I can't breathe, and I can't shake this sick feeling. I'm half alive.
Suddenly, it hits me; a feeling I've never known.

The flood carries us away
I'll hold my breath for other days
And when I hear that voice and everything's okay
Then I'll pray the world my soul to take
Then I'll pray the world my soul to take",The Flood,2007
The Swellers,"Six of us pack in the car and stare out at the stars
Wondering if you're up there
When I heard the news I went numb
At first in denial but somehow, I knew

Don't look down
Set yourself up for falling
Don't look back, the past is never good enough
Don't look up, you won't find answers in the clouds
Keep looking where your eyes are looking now",Keep Looking Where Your Eyes Are Looking Now,2007
The Swellers,"Might be too late, but now I'd love to hear your voice 
Reading words can only do so much for me 
You're out of touch and I'm not even reaching out 
Give me something real, give me something real 

I'd put the whole world in reverse for you 
Retrace the steps that I once thought I knew 
The less I sympathize 
The less you pull through 
Again I'll try, yeah 

I'll call you at a better time 
To let you know that everything's alright 
Now there's no excuse 
When it all come down to size 
I never meant to keep you waiting 

Another page from the calendars ripped out 
The clock stopped ticking 
I no longer hear a sound 
Lost track of days 
Wasting away as time goes by 
Slowly finding out what really matters to me now 

I would put the world on pause for you 
And notice things you never thought I knew 
The less I sympathize 
The less you pull through 
Again I'll try, yeah 

I'll call you at a better time 
To let you know that everything's alright 
Now there's no excuse 
When it all come down to size 
I never meant to keep you 

The less I sympathize 
The less you pull through 
But I still try, yeah 

I'll call you at a better time 
To let you know that everything's alright

The Swellers,"Death, another waste of plans.
I'm shaking I can't stop my hands.
I'm writing words, but I still lost my voice.

Shoved in the back room with old friends, we had no choice.
I never thought I'd see you here.

I don't have clothes for days like these.
I never thought they'd come to me.
But I'm still here.
It wasn't hell that turned you black.
The ashes did when you got back.
I'm sorry.

The same six at all the shows.
But now that it's a funeral, the room is overflowed.
So good of you to finally show support when the admission's free.
And the congregation shows their gratitude.

I don't have clothes for days like these.
I never thought they'd come to me.
But I'm still here.
It wasn't hell that turned you black.
The ashes did when you got back.
I'm sorry.

Would you have you said ""Father"" said you'd say?
It's hard to set words straight once you're away.
They made you speak out of your lifeless mouth.
I read words you wrote when you were around.
You'd want to be a tree, strong in the ground.
And you would've said

""Keep looking where your eyes are looking now",Skoots,2007
The Swellers,"I made it out, you feel in
The deeper the well, the thinner the skin
The worse the wound, bigger the pill
Rebuild, repent
Keep baskets filled

And I know it is all the same
It is all?

Surrounded by hope, a lost campaign
Forever in debt to hot blood, nature beats the sane
Close bloodshot eyes, don't breathe the air
You know the lines and I know it is all the same
You'll never change

No results when talking to brick walls
No guilt trip can compare to this one
It is all?

When you're on top of the world
I'll be waiting for your fall
To relieve the king of the crowd is to finally save us all
And send a message to the weak and socialized

No results when talking to brick walls
No guilt trip can compare to this one
It is all the same",Surrounded,2007
The Swellers,"So this is what it's like to be human
And I should know
A second never felt so long
I tried to put the pieces in their place
Not a man or god,
But somewhere in between;
The body's a machine

It takes a toll too high to see another life
Flash before your eyes
The highway won't just stop itself
If you're alive
There's no more time to think of the might-have-beens
As the old ship sinks
A new horizon waits
But not today

I try to pull myself together
I'm just used to seeing the chest rise and fall
Point taken, man, just breathe again
Hitting the brakes so hard
At the sight of blood and steel 
It tends to make things real

It takes a toll too high to see another life
Flash before your eyes
The highway won't just stop itself
If you're alive
There's no more time to think of the might-have-beens
As the old ship sinks
A new horizon waits

They told me I'd see angels
In their place flashing lights
I'm seeing my mirror image in pieces
No sound, but can you hear me?
I'm screaming out my lungs
I don't believe this
I hope you hear this

It takes a toll too high to see another life
Flash before your eyes
The highway won't just stop itself
If you're alive
There's no more time to think of the might-have-beens
As the old ship sinks

The Swellers,"Uncovered hands are freezing 
I swear its colder than its ever been 
And I miss the feeling 
There's cars along this shit street 
I don't recognize 
I'll stay outside and watch the walls fall harder than the last time 

In the morning when you wake up 
If you change your mind, I'll understand 
Just try to let me know 
I'll still keep the motor running 

With all these bodies empty, 
I'm sickened I can't see through some 
My home away from home 
The faces change but all the songs remain the same 
It hurts sometimes to know what we once loved was left behind 

In the morning when you wake up, 
If you change your mind, I'll understand 
Just try to let me know 
I'll still keep the motor running 

Uncovered hands are still freezing 
I know its colder than its ever been 
And nothing radiates 
The arches glow but they will never shine the same 
At least to me 
So comes the exodus. My family

The Swellers,"I've been looking through the glass
I can barely see, it's too fogged up
Between the trees, the cold has taken all the leaves
Soon I'll watch another branch fall off

Would you believe I'm not just killing time?
I've got a lot of things to do, yeah

We won't stay here too long, but well be here again
And don't forget, we know the way back home
We won't stay here too long, but well be here again

I've been slipping through the cracks
When I show up without my bed, they'll have my back
I'll keep warm in the mitten state
I got more brothers across the lake
And the Chicago city water helps me sing
Home is where the hardest goodbyes are
My heart is in everywhere I've been

We won't stay here too long, but well be here again
And don't forget, we know the way back home

The Swellers,"False alarm, there's no sympathy for time cut short
The mind is numb to the feelings hooked on life support
To sustain this dead world
Brain alive with faulty wires that run their eyes

Lost in hotels with Bibles under TV guides
Kill them all and hope things get much better
Were all addicts looking for the next fix

Why do we always stare into the headlights?
We can only burn the witch one time
Were falling like power lines
It's too late to start over

Burned alive, but one at a times not fast enough
Adrenaline pumps from the silent screams they hear from up above
Kill them all
And let God make more killers
It's entertainment for the massive empty graves

Why do we always stare into the headlights?
We can only burn the witch one time
Were falling like power lines
It's too late to start over

Sanding wide eyed, they get chills
Waiting for the next one
To burn down

What's at stake is more than just the martyr
It's us all
Even as heat rises, well watch some smoke fall

Or should I say she once had me 
She showed me her room 
Isn't it good Norwegian wood? 

She asked me to stay 
And she told me to sit anywhere

And I noticed there wasn't a chair 

I sat on a rug biding my time 
Drinking her wine 
We talked until two and then she said 
""It's time for bed"" 

She told me she worked 
In the morning and started to laugh

The System,"Two nights ago I had a dream
The radio was on and the T.V
I was hungry, I couldn't sleep
So I went down to the kitchen to find something to eat
So I opened up the door of my G.E
I didn't have no groceries
So I headed down to the corner store
Cause I had the bills for a few bites more
There were people dancin' in the stret
Moving to the funky beat just groovin'
They were dancin' to the rhythm of the back beat
So I lost my head and followed the crowd
To a doorway where the music was loud
And inside they were dancin' and singin' and 
I heard them shouting

Hey, this is the house of rhythm, welcome everybody 
Yeah, this is the house of rhythm, we come here to party

The girls were fly and the D.J was rough
He was playin' wild and furious
Scratchin', rappin', cuttin' it up
Yo! this homeboy was serious
I'm the love machine, I never lose thwe crowd
Said all you other D.J's just don't know how to do it like Mr. Nice
I'm like Kentucky fried chicken, I di it right
There were people dancin' in the street
Movin' to a funky beat just groovin'
They were dancin' the rhythm of the back beat
Well, I lost my head started to shout
In my p.j I was turnin' it out
And no one stopped to stare
Cause it doesn't even matter what clothes you're wearin'

Hey this is the house of rhythm, we like to party

But the bridge is up

Something passing by our shore
The only one you can tell it to
Is the only one that will know
As one rock was made to go through my window
Here is something so strange and something louder than before
You’re living with no light or direction but damn precise
And now you know
That believing is hard but you go now
And you feel what you drag across the floor

And now something in these trails is just different
Since they shook the earth in 1904
Some will say it’s not even healthy
But body is young and mind is sure
That at least something is alright with your thinking
Because they shook the earth in 1904.",1904,2012
The Tallest Man on Earth,"Well we air clear blue aching skies in the morning after
And memories of gold on the run, flying around
Was there a drunken cloud over someone just empty
A vision of a mount you say, so where did it go

It was light and I held it like a child to be saved
From the fires and from the falling down satellites
But still wondering

Damn you always treat me like a stranger, mountain
Though you've seen the shadow between the city and what is mine
And fallen kids all rising men among their logs, but leavers
Suddenly darker in their eyes and their broken smiles
It's only what these kids will haul around

Well there's a lot of sullen land for hungry feed of answers
And medicine for balancing things, like seeing your ghosts
So thank god we're bright, said the lanterns brother
Cause I don't know a thing about boats or the land I see

It was day and I stood there once again climbing quick
When I knew you were the one throwing dying stars on our gathering

There must be marks on every tree

Only the may-fly used to tell me so
Now every song has dropped away
Just let go

Now mid-night sun takes turns with northern lights

And somehow I am lowered onto the waves
And when I'm with you I feel the sun and the salt on my face

In the letters from the lovers in a land gone wrong
Explanations always written late
When your talent curse the framing
Of the crying you heard sung
I could lie I don’t care about what’s missing
But sometimes it’s just roses dying too young
Your train of thoughts is always passing here
With its falling paint, and its broken gears
It’s the damn revelation blues when you see the path
And you know you won’t be the last,
Oh lord…
I was more than just a terror
I was crying too
But you showed me in the gusts between

And women came from Mars,
Then I'd be lunching with my boyfriends
While you girls talked about cigars. 

But that's not how it happened;
Evolution took a different turn.
We may be creatures with some unique features
But we've still got a lot to learn. 

We've made it nearly twenty centuries
A bunch of monkeys with PHD's.
Spun a web of communications
But it's all still a tangle to me.

From the dangling flies and moths.
I fell like some outsider,
Who seems to have his wires all crossed.

I can't e-mail you my heart.
I can't see your face in cyberspace,
I don't know where to start.

I'm a carbon based caveman honey, just flesh and bone. 

I ain't no clone, I'm just flesh and bone
Trying to connect with you.
I ain't no clone, I'm just flesh and bone
Tryin' to get the message through. 

Now we live in the age computers.
They run everything in the world.
And I'm a little behind on this technical climb
And your are an Internet girl. 

I've got words but no processor.
I've got feelings but I don't know DOS.
So I just have to go back to basics
And try to get my point across. 

Desperate for a glimpse of the future.,
We use crystals and cards and dice.
And that Y2K is coming our way.
They're talkin' 'bout some worldly strife. 

It's time to think of simpler options.
It's time to formulate a big plan be,
So if your hard drive does crash,
I got some Krugerands stashed.
Come on and sail away with me.

The Tarabinis,"A country dance was being held in a garden
I felt a bump and heard an ""Oh, beg your pardon""
Suddenly I saw polka dots and moonbeams
All around a pug-nosed dream

The music started and was I the perplexed one
I held my breath and said ""May I have the next one?""
In my frightened arms, polka dots and moonbeams
Sparkled on a pug-nosed dream

There were questions in the eyes of other dancers
As we floated over the floor
There were questions but my heart knew all the answers
And perhaps a few things more

Now in a cottage built of lilacs and laughter
I know the meaning of the words ""Ever after""
And I'll always see polka dots and moonbeams
When I kiss the pug-nosed dream",Polka Dots and Moonbeams,2006

Where the rain never falls the sun never shines
It's a dark as a dungeon way down in the mine

(uh huh no laughin' during this song please it's bein' recorded)
Like a fiend with his dope and a drunkard with his wine
A man will have lust for the lure of the mine
And pray when I'm dead and my ages shall roll

There was sand and hills and rings

And the sky with no clouds 
The heat was hot and the ground was dry 
But the air was full of sound

After three days in the desert fun 
I was looking at a river bed 
And the story it told of a river that flowed 
Made me sad to think it was dead 

You see I've been through the desert on a horse with no name 
It felt good to be out of the rain 
In the desert you can remember your name

Under the cities lies a heart made of ground

She returned there to find him
And her memories filled her with light

She remembered desires
And her memories filled her with light

I am the sun in the flame 
Cold from the flame turns away
And in these winds came a change 
She awakes

Sister walk through these fields of delight 
But I want you to know
Desperation's the tenderest trap
So gently you go
What will it take
Sister awake

When this beautiful cult of desire 
Has left you for dead
Isolation will cradle the lies 
Of things left unsaid
What will it take sister awake

And you'll look to the heavens above 
And taste it's deceit
These temptations have blinded desires
To sleep at their feet
What will it take
Sister awake

And you'll hear them call out your name
Invoking the fates
Chances are you've traveled too far
In stirring their hate
What will it take
Sister awake

As you close your eyes

As it sheds it's skin

As the shadows fall
Does a fool rejoice in wisdom

Do you embrace the dancing clayman
As he tears your flesh
Do you hear the souls screaming
In the serpent's mesh

Turn the lamp down low
Please don't go

Do you need the consolation
Of a dead man's hand

Flood a dead man's land

The Tea Party,"I took a slide, slipping down a staircase
A piranesian dream
My senses reeled, distorted by the darkness
I lit my way with a scream
And in the rave an alarum caused a 
Cracked mirror
I got confused by the sound
I turned around and touched it from a distance
And then it fell to the ground

Loud cry from the shallows 
Lust feeds on the fear
Walls crack under pressure
I think the end is getting near

And in my mind was the fury of a madness
That consecrated the dirt
I stumbled through the enigma of the reason
And celebrated the hurt
And then I found through an act of desperation
A subtle rip in the heart
I was seduced by the fear of devastation
And then it tore me apart

Oh no, nothing matters
When it takes me
When it rapes me, breaks me
Shakes me down

A quick escape from the edge of commination
I slept the night with my spleen
A vain excuse, I was searching for some answers
I broke away from the scene
Because after all animality's an instinct
And it's luxuria's slave
To taste the truth, it's a seizure of the senses
And it's a foot in the grave",Alarum,1997

Can lead you to slaughter

You were shamed 

You could almost touch heaven 
Right there in front of you 
Liberty just slipped away on us 
Now there's so much work to do 
Oh the door that closes tightly 
Is the door than can swing wide 
Oh no not expecting to collide 

For a minute I let my guard down 
Not afraid to be found out 
I completely forgot dear 
What our fears were all about 
Oh no there's no need to be without 

If there's a chance I would take it 
This desire I can't kill

I see my red door and it has been painted black

Beneath the creeping vine
A flower trys to change its tries to satisfy
It's thrist without the rains

So I can relearn love

Your tender hands caress my head
I lay beside you, I'm not worthy
This jaded man's not who I am
I've touched the flame and I've been burned
All I need is a second chance
Give me eyes of a child
And teach this man

Show me again
So I can relearn love

You gave me the greatest gift of all
And it set me free

The Tear Garden,"You're number eight. Your name is Jane, with black hair, braids, and black lines around your eyes... Shades to hide your habit. I don't know your age, though you guessed mine... My sign. Your sign! The opening line is always just the same. The same intention, destination. You and me and rainbows.
Loaded guns attract. We know the rules, we don't react. We wait in hope, we don't expect - You and me and rainbows.
Down here everything is fine. We have a straw, we have a line. We have a bag, a rock, a mountain with a string of shepherds driving lions. Aiming skewers at the sheep... face down, asleep in onion fields. The frying fields. The worms... they peep through holes which once were eyes. They thrive... they bake although we painted out the sky and the sun. There's only thunder, and you and me and raindows.
Let's hide out in the lay-by, let the time fly by. Tonight's disguise - a car crash with our wheels like shattered stars, our dashboard charred. Our windscreen... a graveyard for the flies (we're fast!) The hungry flies are circling, mourning as the watchers squat with cameras, cakes and flasks. They're spying, spitting as the blue light flashes, axes swing. We're broken wings, but still we'll fly and we'll reach our destination - you and me and rainbows.
And if we turn the lights down low and watch the sky cry through the window... Will I watch your fingers grow and stretch like butterflies? The shadows flexing, licking toes, and blinding as slowly sun sets on the same old hill. The same red glow. We're quite alone - just you and me and rainbows.
Everything I own is in the corner of your room. It's covered with a sheet just like it died - but I will take a broom. I'll sweep it new again, arrange it... Oh, I'll grow a dozen hands. No I never will neglect my world again. I'm safe beneath my blanket. Call it home... For you. For me... and rainbows
Loaded guns attract
We know the rules, we don't react
We wait in hope
We don't expect
Just you and me and rainbows

Cried ""meltdown zero marsh of lava""
Had supersonic sight
And barriers of you and me piled 1500 high
Stacked here to here in smoking cans
We blackened out the sky
King met king we heard the bell
They kicked away the board
Flew headfirst into bunkers
Then they started out once more
And you and me were born again
As iron-plated pawns
We scorched our way through libraries
We shredded all the lawns
Til everything was rust and powder
Every stone was turned
And random programs re-arranged the areas to burn
The enemy's years ahead
He's tapped into the phone
He hides beneath the furniture
Knows all the special codes
The enemy's our destiny
He's pulling on the cord
He spits a line I spastic dive
And sell him his reward

One will play the liberator the other run and hide
I hear the cannons crack a mile down freedom street

I tried to get away from you
I tried to make a break
You always see right through me, there's no escape
I can still remember you with coronets, white horses
I would run behind you'd flash a sign I'd dive
Just to serve you
Night time's turned the lady to a girl again, you'd slip away
You tried to kiss my tears away, pretend there was no day to take me down
Nightshade, blades, Niagra falls - I tried them all six times

Of hollow promises
And it's lonely here.

The Teardrop Explodes,"I've been living through changes
And I could swing for you

Are showing through

But if you disguise
What these things are doing to me
If you criticize them
I'll know that you can see

Is getting rather strange
I can see your course of action
Leading to a change

You've got to get ready for me
Is it real
Or is it treason
Is it treason

I've been living through changes
It's not the same thing every day
I hope it's not my age
But I wouldn't like to say

Mirror hopping days are a coarse reaction
Oh it's very hard to fight
I tried to find a plan of action
But I couldn't get it right

All the megaphones are screaming letters of the lord
Would you walk in through the gate and visit me?
Would you please? In the asylum

When they're counting out the chemicals and doing daily tasks
Giving out prescription drugs and putting on their masks
Would you wander through the ground to visit me?

And our shadows painted many different shapes

And we kick through broken bits of glass

You said you would always stay
It wasn't me who changed but you and now you've gone away
Don't you see that now you've gone
And I'm left here on my own
That I have to follow you and beg you to come home

You don't have to say you love me just be close at hand
You don't have to stay forever I will understand
Believe me, believe me I can't help but love you
But believe me I'll never tie you down
Left alone with just a memory
Life seems dead and quite unreal
All that's left is loneliness there's nothing left to feel

You don't have to say you love me just be close at hand
You don't have to stay forever

When you touched my arm

So I smiled and then believed
That you always be right by my side
And so happy that way
But now I have to watch you leave
And what's even worse
I can't be hunting anymore

It's just like I'm cursed
And I don't know what I'm for
I'd like to be good, or great
Or even any other way
But the best I can get is okay
But I refuse to cry
I just throw up until I'm in tears

Because I've got your laugh
And you keep on sitting here
I wish you would call or write
I bet that you can't sleep at night

On day 1 I met her hot step daughter
She's a cheerleader, she is a virgin and she is really tan
As she stepped out of her massive car
I could only notice she was more than fuckable
I think she was coming back from the game or something
Cause she was holding those silly pompoms
On day 2 I fucked her and it was wild
She is such a slut

I fucked my american cunt
I loved my english romance
I fucked my american cunt
I loved my english romance
It was dirty a dream came true
Just like I like it she's got nice tits
It was perfect a dream came true
Just like a song by blink182

ok listen girls
I met the hottest guy ever
Basically as I was stepping out of my s.u.v.
I came face to face with my step cousin or whatever
Who cares
Anyway he was wearing skinny jeans had funky hair
And the cutest british accent ever
Straight away I could tell he was a rocker
With his sexy attitude and the way he looked at me
Mmm he is totally awesome
Oh my god I think I'm in love

I fucked my american cunt
I loved my english romance
I fucked my american cunt
I loved my english romance

Love will keep you up, and always be the crutch

At the center of revolutionary endeavor, he meant both

Hmm, you've changed and it's showing, baby
You've changed and it's showing
Tell me, where is your love going? 

The plans we were making up, for I'll never break it up
Like dreams when you're waking up, are fading away
Fading away, fading away

The good times - we shared a lot, when you really cared a lot
Like steam from a coffee pot, it's fading way
Fading away, fading away

You've changed and it's showing, baby

The Temptations,"You played hookie from school and you can't go out to play, yeah
Mama said, for the rest of the week, in your room you gotta stay, yeah
Oh ho, now you feel like the whole world's pickin' on you
But deep down inside, you know it ain't true
 
You're in punishment 
'Cause your mother wants to raise you in the right way, yeah
But you don't care
'Cause you already made up your mind you wanna run away yeah
You're on your way, runaway child, running wild
Runaway child running wild
Better go back home where you belong
 
Roaming through the city going nowhere fast, you're on your own at last
Hey, it's gettin' late, where will you sleep? 
You're gettin' kinda hungry, you forgot to bring something to eat
Oh, lost with no money you start to cry
But remember, you left home wantin' to be grown, so dry your weeping eyes
 
Sirens screamin' down neon lighted streets
You want your mama
Run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run
Are they looking for you? 
You're frightened and confused
I want my mama
Run, run, run, run, run, run, run
But she's much too far away, she can't hear a word you say
 
You've heard some frightening news on the radio
About little boys running away from home
And the parents don't see them no more
You wanna stop to hitch a ride, I know
But your mama told you never trust a stranger
And you don't know which way to go
 
Streets are dark and deserted, not a sound nor sign of life
Oh how you long to hear your mother's voice, 'cause you're lost and alone
But remember, you made the choice, runaway child, running wild
You better go back home where you belong
He he he, oh, runaway child, running wild
You better go back home where you belong
You're lost in this great big city
Go back home where you belong
Not one familiar face, ain't it a pity
Go back home where you belong
Oh, runaway child running wild
You better go back home where you belong
Oh yeah, my girl
Mama, mama, please, come and sit here by me
Oh but she's much too far away, she can't hear a word you say
Oh, you're frightened and confused, which way will you choose","Runaway Child, Running Wild",1994
The Temptations,"Remember me the one who heard your cries
And reached out and dried your eyes

Remember me the one who found you and wrapped all my love around you
When you were all alone and all your dreams were gone
When you were nothing but a tear stained face I took you in
Know your broken wing has mended and your need for me has ended
Know you say you must be free
You wanna fly away from me
You were lost in yesterday I gave you my tomorrow
Know your leaving me in sorrow and you telling me: ""im sorry"" but baby

Sorry is a sorry word after all I've done for you
Sorry is a sorry word when I need a love that's true

Out of sympathy and all you feel for me
After all the sweet love I've given you (given you baby)
Girl you walk away with the best of me
The love I gave to you, you given to someone new
And sorry won't ease this misery

Remember me who took the hand, held it up to make a stand
Remember me the one who's love has shared, with one who really cares

Now you've turned away from me and say that you sorry
That it had to be baby sorry it had to be that way

The Temptations,"Mom was cooking bread
She wore a dirty raggety scarf around her head
Always had her stockings low
Rolled to her feet, she just didn't know
She wore a sloppy dress
Oh no matter how she tried, she always looked a mess
Out of the pot she ate, never used a fork or a dinner plate
I was always so ashamed for my uptown friends to see her
Afraid one day when I was grown that I would be her

In a college town, away from home, a new identity I found
Said I was born elite, with maids and servants at my feet
I must have been insane
I lied and said my mom died on a weekend trip to Spain
She never got out of the house, never even boarded a train
I married a guy, was livin' high
I didn't want him to know her
She had a grandson, two years old
I never even showed her

I'm livin' in shame, Momma, I miss you
I know you are not to blame, Momma, I miss you

Came the telegram
Mom passed away while making homemade jam
Before she died, she cried to see me by her side
She always did her best, ah! cookin', cleanin'
Always in the same old dress
Workin' hard down on her knees
Always try'n to please
Momma!  Momma!  Momma, do you hear me
Momma!  Momma!  Momma, do you hear me

I'm livin' in shame, Momma, I miss you
I know you've done your best
Momma, I miss you
Won't you forgive me Momma
For all the wrong I've done
I know you have done your best
I know you have done your very best you could
But I never understood
Workin' hard on your knees

Is truly a dream come true

Seems it was just my imagination

Soon we'll be married
And raise a family, oh yeah
Have a cozy little house in the country
With two kids maybe three
I tell you I can visualize it all
This couldn't be a dream, for too real it all seems

But it was just my imagination
Runnin' away with me-once again
Seems it was just my imagination
Runnin' away with me

Every night on my knees I pray
Dear Lord hear my plea
Don't ever let another take her away from me
For I would surely die
Her love is heavenly
When her arms enfold me I hear a tender rhapsody

Can't keep his mind on nothing else
He'll trade the world
For the good thing he's found
If she's bad he can't see it
She can do no wrong
Turn his back on his best friend
If he put her down

When a man loves a woman
Spend his very last dime
Trying to hold on to what he needs
He'd give up all his comfort
Sleep out in the rain
If she said that's the way it ought to be

Well, this man loves a woman
I gave you everything I had
Trying to hold on to your precious love
Baby, please don't treat me bad

When a man loves a woman
Down deep in his soul
She can bring him such misery
If she plays him for a fool
He's the last one to know
Loving eyes can't ever see

When a man loves a woman
He can do no wrong
He can never own some other girl

Lord knows it's only me
Only know it's me
That I'm missing you
When it comes to saying good-bye
That a simple word that I just cannot say
There can be no way
There can be no way
This can have a happy ending
No, no
So we just go on
Hurting and pretending
Convincing ourselves to give it just one more try

Because I guess neither one of us
Neither one of us wants to be the first to say
Neither one of us wants to be the first to say
Neither one of us wants to be the first to say
Farewell my love
Goodbye

But they don't move me, and they don't groove me
Like when I hear your sweet voice whispering in my ear.

I pretend I'm not in reality.
I need the shelter of your arms to comfort me.

I got some memories to look back on
And though they help me when you're gone,

Needed something to ease my troubled mind.

Listen one more time I'm doin' fine, up here on cloud nine.
Folks down there tell me,
They say, ""give yourself a chance son, don't let life pass you by"".
But the world of reality is a rat race where only the strongest survive,
It's a dog eat dog world, and that ain't no lie.
Listen!  it ain't even safe no more to walk the streets at night,

The Temptations Review,"Hoverin' by my suitcase
Tryin' to find a warm place to spend the night
A heavy rain a fallin'
Seems I hear your voice callin'
""It's all right""

A rainy night in Georgia
A rainy night in Georgia
I believe it's rainin' all over the world

Neon signs a flashin'
Taxi cabs and busses passin' through the night
The distant moanin' of a train
Seems to play a sad refrain to the night

How many times I've wondered
It still comes out the same
No matter how you look at it, think of it
You just got to do your own thing

I find me a place in a box car
So I take out my guitar to pass some time
Late at night when it's hard to rest
I hold your picture to my chest
And I'm all right

The Temptations Review,"Each day through my window I watch her as she passes by
I say to myself you're such a lucky guy,
To have a girl like her is truly a dream come true
Out of all the fellows in the world she belongs to me.
But it was just my imagination,
Runnin' away with me.
It was just my imagination runnin' away with me

Soon we'll be married and raise a family (Oh yeah)
A cozy little home out in the country with two children maybe three.
I tell you I can visualize it all
This couldn't be a dream for too real it all seems;
But it was just my imagination once again runnin' way with me.
Tell you it was just my imagination runnin' away with me.

Every night on my knees I pray, Dear Lord, Hear my plea;
Don't ever let another take her love from me or I would surely die.
Her love is heavenly, when her arms enfold me,
I hear a tender rhapsody, but in reality she doesn't even know me.

Just my imagination once again runnin' way with me.
Tell you it was just my imagination runnin' away with me.
No, no, I can't forget her

The Temptones,"Sunshine blue skies please go away
The girl has found another and gone away.
With her went my future my life is filled with gloom
So day after day I stay locked up in my room.
I know to you, it might sound strange but I wish it would rain,

'Cause so badly I wanna go outside
But everyone knows that a man ain't supposed to cry
Listen, I gotta cry 'cause crying eases the pain,
Oh yeah, people this hurt I feel inside.
Words could never explain, I just wish it would rain.

Day in day out my tear-stained face
Pressed against the window pain,
My eyes search the skies desperately for rain,
Cause rain-drops will hide my tear -drops
And no one will ever know that I'm crying,
Crying when I go outside.
To the world outside my tears,
I refuse to explain, oh I wish it would rain,
Let it rain, let it rain.
I need rain to disguise the tears in my eyes.
Oh, let it rain.
I'm a man and I got my pride
Til' it rains I'm gonna stay inside and let it rain.",I Wish It Would Rain [Acappella],1996
The Ten Black Berries,"It was down by old Joe's barroom, on the corner of the square
They were serving drinks as usual, and the usual crowd was there
On my left stood Big Joe McKennedy, and his eyes were bloodshot red
And he turned his face to the people, these were the very words he said

I was down to St. James infirmary, I saw my baby there
She was stretched out on a long white table, 
So sweet, cool and so fair

Let her go, let her go, God bless her
Wherever she may be
She may search this whole wide world over
Never find a sweeter man as me

When I die please bury me in my high top Stetson hat
Put a twenty dollar gold piece on my watch chain
The gang'll know I died standing pat

Let her go, let her go God bless her
Wherever she may be
She may search this wide world over
Never find a sweeter man as me

I want six crapshooters to be my pallbearers
Three pretty women to sing a song
Stick a jazz band on my hearse wagon
Raise hell as I stroll along

Let her go Let her go
God bless her
Wherever she may be
She may search this whole wide
World over
She'll never find a sweeter
Man as me",St. James Infirmary,1991
