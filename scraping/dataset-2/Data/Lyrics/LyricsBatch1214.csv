You've got me on the go
Fascinating rhythm
I'm all a-quiver

What a mess you're making
The neighbors want to know
Why I'm always shaking
Just like a flivver

Each morning I get up with the sun
To find at night no work has been done

I know that
Once it didn't matter
But now you're doing wrong
When you start to patter
I'm so unhappy
Won't you take a day off?
Decide to run along
Somewhere far away off
And make it snappy

Oh, how I long to be the girl I used to be

Oh, won't you stop picking on me?

Tony Bennett,"How glad a million laddies
From millionaires to caddies
Would be to capture me
But you had such persitence
You wore down my resistance
I fell, and it was swell

You're my big and brave and handsome Romeo
How I won you, I shall never, never know
It's not that you're attractive
But, oh, my heart grew active
When you came into view

I've got a crush on you, sweetie pie
All the day and night-time, hear me sigh
I never had the least notion
That I could fall with so much emotion

Could you coo?
Could you care
For a cunning cottage we could share?
The world will pardon my mush

Tony Bennett,"My one and only
What am I gonna do if you turn me down
When I'm so crazy over you

I'd be so lonely
Where am I gonna go if you turn me down
Why blacken all my skies of blue

Let a million firms go under
I am not concerned with
Stocks and bonds that I've been burned with

I love you and you love me
And that's how it will always be
And nothing else can ever mean a thing

Who cares what the public chatters
Love's the only thing that matters

Who cares if the sun falls to shine from up above 
Who cares what banks fail in Yonkers
Long as you've got a kiss that conquers?

Why should I care?
Life is one long jubilee
As long as I care for you
And you really care for me

Tony Braunagel,"I used to visit all the very gay places

Those come-what-may places
I used to visit all the very gay places
Where one relaxes on the axis of the wheel of life
To get the feel of life
From jazz and cocktails.

The girls I knew had sad and sullen gray faces
With distinguish traces
That used to be there
You could see where they'd been washed away
By too many through the day
Twelve o'clock tales

Then you came along with your siren song
To tempt me to madness

I thought for a while that your poignant smile
Was tinged with the sadness

Of a great love for me.
Ah yes, I was wrong.
Again, I was wrong.

Life is lonely again,
And only last year, everything seemed so sure.
Now life is awful again,
A trough full of hearts could only be a bore.

A week in Paris will ease the bite of it
All I care is to smile in spite of it

I'll forget you, I will
While yet you are still
Burning inside my brain
Romance is mush
Stifling those who strive
I'll live a lush life in some small dive
And there I'll be, while I rot with the rest
Of those whose lives are lonely too.",Lush Life,2010

A signed confession that he'd repented and really wanted no one but me.

Five thousand tongues are screaming out ""More"" and ""More""

Because life is so brief and time is a thief when you're undecided.

As he carried you away
From your father's hand

Reaching out to make you pay
He came like a hero from the factory floor
With the sun and moon as gifts
But the only son you ever saw
Were the two he left you with
Oh Lord where did the feeling go
Oh Lord I never felt so low
Now the skirts hang so heavy around your head
That you never knew you were young
Because you played chance with a lifetime's romance
And the price was far too long

It tells me where you've been through
I watch the way the sun sets
Until the night's inside you
Some days I just don't worry, I let it walk through me
Some days I need to bury the very depths of me
So out here to the east of Eden
I let salvation be
I was waiting, I was watching
Would it ever be there for me
And I found that hope and a lucky card
Were all I had to walk with me
Had to walk with me
I watch the way the crow flies
I know it always seems so easy
But if I see it in a grey sky
Can I be sure about the way it leads me
Some days I just don't worry, I let it walk through me
Some days I call upon the very depths of me
So out here to the east of Eden
I watch your soul run free
I was waiting, I was watching
Would it ever be before me
And I found that hope and a lucky card
Were all I had to walk with me
I was waiting, I was watching
Would it ever be before me
And I found that hope and a lucky card
Were all I had to walk with me
Some days will stay a thousand years
Some pass like the flash of a spark
Who knows where all our days go
Out here we lie together
Outside the thunder gathers
Why care about the weather
It always ends in dark
I looked west in search of freedom and I saw slavery
I looked east in search of answers and I saw misery
Some days I just don't worry, I let it walk through me
Some days I walk into the very depths of me
So out here to the east of Eden

Tony Campise,"An old cowpoke went riding out one dark and windy day,
Upon a ridge he rested as he went along his way,
When all at once a mighty herd of red-eyed cows he saw,
A ploughin' through the ragged skies
And up a cloudy draw.
Yippee-yi-ay, yippee-yi-o,
The ghost herd in the sky.

Their brands were still on fire and their hooves was made of steel,
Their horns wuz black and shiny and their hot breath he could feel,
A bolt of fear went through him as they thundered through the sky,
For he saw the riders comin' hard
And he heard their mournful cry.
Yippee-yi-ay, yippee-yi-o,
Ghost riders in the sky.

Their faces gaunt their eyes were blurred and shirts all soaked
With sweat,
They're ridin' hard to catch that herd but they ain't caught them yet
'Cause they've got to ride forever on that range up in the sky,
On horses snortin' fire
As they ride on, hear their cry.
Yippee-yi-ay, yippee-yi-o,
Ghost riders in the sky.

As the riders loped on by him he heard one call his name,
""If you want to save your soul from hell a-riding on our range,
Then cowboy change your ways today or with us you will ride
A-try'ng to catch the devil's herd
Across these endless skies.""

Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms

Of paradise, where roses grew

In my heart it will remain

And stuck his fingers in the crown,
And he pulled out twenty dollars 
And he laid that money down.

And he called out to a taxi cab, 
""Take me down to central park,
And keep that meter runnin' 
To the twenty dollar mark.""

And he sat up straight and tall

I was just about this tall
And he always made my momma

Would stand and whisper in the hall
Then they'd disappear, 
And maybe not come home at all.

Heard he'd gotten himself into

He took the mother lode and I took the rest
He was a fighter, he was always in control
He kept a candle burning way down in his soul

shots fired in anger and a widow cries alone
Just one more mother's son who won't be coming home
They speak in whispers there are riders to the east
The blind man says mister bring a bottle and a priest

Let the river wash you away
Reach the river if you can
Past the blue and past the grey

there was no shelter there was nowhere left to run
They came like eagles screaming down out of the sun
I heard the whistle sound the engine pulled away
I saw my brother down and I left him where he lay

some fight for honor there are those that fight for gold
Some die believing all the fairy tales they're told
There are no heroes and there is no marching bang
There are no miracles down here in no man's land

I will shine just like the sun

We will fight them in the fields

And he took off his fedora,
and stuck his fingers in the crown,
And he pulled out twenty dollars
and he laid that money down.

And he called out to a taxi cab,
""Take me down to central park,
And keep that meter runnin'
to the twenty dollar mark.""
And he kept his eyes turned forward
and he sat up straight and tall
And no one even noticed him,
no one cared at all.

It's a Fine, Fine Day,
for a reunion.
It's a Fine, Fine Day,
for comin' home.
You did your sittin',
you did hard time.
But you ain't gonna sit no more,
they can't keep you there no more.
It's a Fine, Fine Day
And nothin's gonna take it,
nothin's gonna take it away
It's a Fine, Fine Day.

First time I saw Sonny,
I was just about this tall
And he always made my momma
kinda crazy when he'd call.
Him and my old man
would stand and whisper in the hall
Then they'd dissappear,
and maybe not come home at all.

Then one day Sonny stopped comin' round
Heard he'd gotten himself into
a little trouble out in town
Sometime after that
he finally disappeared for good,
Then he pulled out ol' Houdini,
like we always knew he would!

""I see you made it back alright, alright.
I see you're none the worse for wear
It's been a long time comin'
Nothin's gonna drag you away from here!""

A Fine, Fine Day!
And nothin's gonna take,
nothin's gonna take it away
Oh yeah

Tears will leave no stain 
Time will ease the pain 
For every light that fades 
Something beautiful remains 

 We're living in a world of stars and dust 
Between heaven and all that surrounds us 
We're travellers here, spirits passing through 
And the love we give, is all that will endure 
Hey now, what we had is gone 
But I still remember you 
Just like a rose after the rain 
Something beautiful remains 

 Tears will leave no stain 
Time will ease the pain 
For every light that fades 
Something beautiful remains 

 Now the darkness falls, the sun's going down 
One by one, the stars are coming out 
Tide comes in, washes footprints from the sand 
As one day ends, a new day must begin 
Hey now, though we are apart 
You're here forever in my dreams 
Hey now, love is lost and gained 
(What you gonna do about it, what you gonna say) 
Something beautiful remains 

 Tears will leave no stain 
Time will ease the pain 
For every light that fades 
Something beautiful remains 

 And you wonder sometimes how we carry on 
When you've lost the love you knew 
But it's alright, it's alright 
To your own heart be true",Something Beautiful Remains,1991

Look around the jungle 
See the rough and tumble

to visit out of town.

and the words came automatically,

Just being on my own, 
But as usual by the evening, 
I was wishing she was home, 
And I thought to myself when she gets back, 
I'll show her how I care, 
And on that god forsaken night, 
I said me a little prayer.

And the weatherman says the freezing rain may turn to snow,

Mind how you go,

Well I waited and I worried, 
As the long night dragged on by, 
And I thought my prayers where answered, 
When a car drew up outside, 
But a stranger stood there by the door, 
And I knew it at a glance, 
He said, 
There's been an accident, 
She didn't stand a chance. 

Drive safely darlin', 
That was our last goodbye, 
Till the day I die I'll wonder why I let her go,

Tony Christie,"Now Eva Peron had every disadvantage
You need if you're gonna succeed
No money, no cash
No father, no bright lights
There was nowhere she'd been
At the age of fifteen

As this tango singer found out
Agustin Magaldi
Who has the distinction of being the first
Man to be of use to Eva Duarte

On this night of a thousand stars
Let me take you to heaven's door
Where the music of love's guitars
Plays for evermore

In the glow of those twinkling lights
We shall love through eternity
On this night in a million nights
Fly away with me

I never dreamed that a kiss could be as sweet as this
But now I know that it can
I used to wander alone without a love of my own
I was a desperate man
But all my grief disappeared and all the sorrow I'd feared
Wasn't there anymore
On that magical day when you first came my way
Mi amor

On this night of a thousand stars
Let me take you to heaven's door
Where the music of love's guitars
Plays for evermore",On This Night of a Thousand Stars,1995
Tony Christie,"Memories light the corners of my mind
Misty water-colored memories of the way we were
Scattered pictures of the smiles we left behind
Smiles we gave to one another for the way we were

Can it be that it was all so simple then
Or has time rewritten every line
If we had the chance to do it all again
Tell me, would we?
Could we?

Memories may be beautiful and yet
What's too painful to remember
We simply choose to forget
So it's the laughter we will remember
Whenever we remember
The way we were
The way we were",The Way We Were,1995
Tony Christie,"Girl, don't you know every time I see you smiling,
It hurts so bad, cause when I see you, I start crying,
I've tried everything to stop, but there's no denying,
That falling in love with you, girl, is just like dying.

Oh, don't walk away,
How, how can I make you stay?
Don't turn away,
I can still hear you saying those words that never were true,
Just spoken to help nobody but you,
Words with lies inside,
But, small enough to hide till your playing was through.

Girl, don't you know we could work it out with talking?
You won't look around or slow down your walking,
I've given you everything with kiss to seal it,
You had to get your kicks out of trying to steal it.

Now, I'm standing here,
Strange, strange voices in my ears,
I feel the tears,
But, all I can hear are those words that never were true,
Just spoken to help nobody but you,
Words with lies inside,
But, small enough to hide till your playing was through, ahh.

Tony Christie,"Sleep like a baby 
My little lady
Dream tell the sunrise
Creeps into your eyes, dream tell the sunrise turns on the day

In the avenues and alleyways
While you sleep there's a whole world comin alive
Abel and his brother fight with one another
In and out of every dive
The avenues and alleyways
Where the strong and the quick alone can survive
Look around the jungle 
See the rough and tumble
Listen to a squealer cry
Then a little later in the morning paper
Read about the way he died

Wake up my pretty
Go to the city
Stay through the daytime
Safe in the sunshine 
Stay till the daytime turns into night

Where a man's gotta work out which side he's on
Anyway he chooses 
Chances are he looses

Goodnight and thank you Huevo
She is in every magazine
Been photographed, seen, she is known

If she's missed anything, you could give her a ring
But she won't always answer the phone

But we have pretended enough
It's best that we both stop fooling ourselves

(Che and Eva:)
There is no one, no one at all
Never has been, and never will be a lover, male or female
Who hasn't an eye on, in fact they rely on
Tricks they can try on their partner
They're hoping their lover will help them or keep them
Support them, promote them
Don't blame them, you're the same

Goodnight and thank you Emilio
You've completed your task
What more can we ask of you now?
Please sign the book on the way out the door
And that will be all, if she needs you she'll call
But I don't think that's likely somehow

There is no soap, no soap like Zaz
No detergent, lotion, or oil with such power in the shower

You're scented, you'll be sent

(Che:)
Goodnight and thank you Senor Jabon
We are grateful you found her a spot on the sound radio
We'll think of you every time she's on the air
We'd love you to stay but you'd be in the way
So do up your trousers and go

(Eva:)
Oh but it's sad when a love affair dies
The decline into silence and doubt
Our passion was just too intense to survive

(Che:)
Which means ...

(Lovers:)
This is a club I should never have joined
Someone has made us look fools
Argentine men call the sexual shots
Someone has altered the rules

Fame on the wireless as far as it goes
Is all very well but every girl knows

She needs a man she can monopolize
With fingers in dozens of different pies

Tony Christie,"Something in your eyes and fire on the scene
Music in the air and on your lips a taste of wine.
Now the day is leaving and the night is near.
Walking side by side, your hand is touching me so softly.
Let's go for a swim, the water's soft and warm, 
we're alone and nothing but the moonlight on your skin.
And the waves are kissing you and the sky is deep and blue, we are in heaven.

Moonlight and roses, your sweet embraces.
I'm dreaming in your arms, I feel the charm that's burning our hearts
Moonlight and dreaming, we're never leaving.
This night will never end. It's made for you and me.

You begin to cry, I'll take you in my arms
and wipe a way the teardrops running down your skin.
Listen to the silence counting all the stars.
See the flowers and the leaves they are falling all around you.

For you I sigh, for you dear only

And wondering why it's me you're wronging
I tell you I mean it
I'm all for you body and soul

It's hard to conceive it
That you'd turn away romance
Are you pretending
It looks like the ending
Unless I could have just one more chance to prove, dear

You know I'm yours for just the taking
I'd gladly surrender myself to you body and soul

Tony Coe,"On every tree there sits a bird, singing a song of love
On every tree there sits a bird, and ev'ryone I ever heard 
Could break my heart without a word singing a song of love
 
A song of love is a sad song, Hi-Lili, Hi-Lili, Hi-Lo
A song of love is a song of woe, don't ask me how I know
A song of love is a sad song, for I have loved and it's so
I sit at the window and watch the rain, Hi-Lili, Hi-Lili, Hi-Lo
Tomorrow I'll probably love again, Hi-Lili, Hi-Lili, Hi-Lo
 
A tear for him, a tear for me, A tear for the love he swore
A tear for him and one for me, and one for under the cedar tree
And one for where ever my love my be, and then I shall weep no more
 
A song of love is a sad song, Hi-Lili, Hi-Lili, Hi-Lo

And here am I
Throwing caution to the wind

Though I see the danger there
If there's a chance for me, then I don't care

Fools rush in where wise men never go
But wise men never fall in love, so how are they to know?
When we met, I felt my life begin
So open up your heart and let this fool rush in

Fools rush in where wise men never, never, never go
Eh, but wise men never fall in love, so how are they to know?
Ah, when we met, girl, I felt my life begin

Meine Heimat ist Berlin, eine Welt für sich
Denn sie blendet jede andre Stadt in grelles Licht
Die Straße scheint, wir tragen Königsketten
Wenn wir sie löhnen wenn wir betteln, weil wir böse rappen
Wir treiben uns rum, haben die Schule geschwänzt
Rum gestresst, denn jeder war im Jugendarrest
Hat einen Gerichtstermin
Das hier ist Berlin
Deutsche wollen in diese Stadt, doch haben's nicht verdient

Waren nur ein zwei Stunden in dein kleines Kaff
Doch wir nehmen euch die Schmach wie ein eigenes Land
Es ist unglaublich, man sieht Blaulicht überall
Hier ist Silvester schon am ersten Mai
Und fast jeder hat bewirkt was mit großen Tabu
Mit deinen Fehlern am Block von den Bullen im Zug
Die Lichter brennen wenn das Nachtleben losbricht lichterloh
Groupies werden hier bedroht
Ich wünsch' mir die Mauer zurück
Wenn du nicht raust kommst, wir laufen ein Stück
Jeden Tag gibt es neue Probleme (Doch keine Lösung)
Willkommen in meiner Gegend

Willkommen in Berlin, in der Stadt der Probleme
Das hier ist Berlin, diese Stadt in der ich lebe
Man steht in Berlin, Sport man die Macht der Straße
Es gibt keine Konkurrenz, wir sind einzigartig

Willkommen in Berlin, wir haben die größte Schnauze
Das hier ist Berlin, das hier ist mein Zuhause
Weil ich lieb Berlin und hasse dein beschissenes Kaff
Aus der Gosse in die Charts wir sind die Kinder der Nacht

Willkommen in meiner Stadt wo die Nacht zum Tag wird
Wo die Spack die grad' turnt nachts im Park stirbt
Es ist nichts wie es aussieht mach dich rar, Knirps
Blas' die Bars mit einer dieser Hits, die im Lauf liegt
Spits bis sie auffliegt, spit bis mein Licht in den Rauch zieht
Spit ich vernichte dich auch, Freak!
Du bist es nicht gewohnt, hockst den ganzen Tag im Dorf rum
Wo wir herkommen ist Hass oft an der Tagesordnung
Pack' die Rapsticks um ich mach Business
Hinter verschlossenen Türen wie Kabinettssitzung
Wie die Mücken auf der Bank in Bronx
Oder bar auf die Hand, oder ganz in Fonds.
Für den Rolls Royce und das Stückchen Land in France
Deine starken Strahlen strahlen wie Lampions
Und du boxt dich von unten durch
Auch wenn der Shit den du bringst nicht stimmt bist du unten durch

Ich hab' mit 23 Jahren alles geseh'n
Für was es sich nicht lohnt zu leben
Ich hatte 1000 Hürden auf meinen Wegen
Doch guck mich an ich hab noch nicht aufgegeben
Ich leb mein Leben
Schon als Kind war es hart (hart)
Ich konnte einfach nicht machen was man mir sagt (sagt)
Ich wollte nicht hören
Alles klang nach Stumpfsinn
Ich wollte den ganzen Tag sein, wo die Jungs sind
Action machen war cooler als die Schule
Ich wollte aufdrehen
Weil die Weiber drauf stehen
Hauptsache ficken
Geld machen mit ticken
Mama wollte mich aufs Gymnasium schicken
Stattdessen durfte sie mich bei den Bullen abholen
Dabei war sie schon gestresst wegen den kack Kohlen
Heute tut's mir leid
Doch ich kann die zeit
Nicht zurück drehen
Ich leb' mein leben

Schau ich mal zurück
Geb ich auf die Schule keinen Fick
Auf keine Hure einen Fick
Auf die Zukunft keinen Fick
Guckst du dich mal um merkst du das macht heute jeder
Doch viele wissen nicht warum ihr Kühlschrank
Wird nie leerer
Haben immer was zuessen
Dafür Eltern die immer stressen
Mich haben sie nie gestresst
Aber dafür ganz vergessen
Hab ich mal action geh ich mit Gewalt vor
So bin ich aufgewachsen
Meine Straßen sind Hardcore
Sie dich vor Gangster zu sein ist nix leichtes
In ne Gang zu kommen und cool zu tun das reicht nicht
Ich bin ein Killa
Ick, Bildung? Nein, das weiß ich
Frag die Jungs aus Neukölln 44 36
Bei mir in der Gegend is man kein Casanova
Mädchen fickt man hier im Hausflur
Kein Kondom da

Mein Leben ist extrem
Es geht ums überleben
Jede nacht muss ich nachdenken
Und überlegen
Wie kann ich im leben was schaffen oder bewegen
Wo die leute noch in hundert jahren
Drüber reden
So wie Che Gevara, Gingis Kahn oder Bin Laden
Sie hatten alle eins gleich sie waren geladen
Ich bin eh schon tot
Fang an mein grab zu graben
Egal was passiert ich steh für sekte raps und balladen

Sind damit auch gut gefahren
So wirds auch bleiben

Nutte, mach' mir Platz, ich bin hart wie ein Stein
Ich pack' dich am Zopf
Und fick' deinen Kopf
Komm' mal klar! Komm' Mal klar!
Mein Schwanz ist Anabolika
Verbiete meinen Rap und du pushst mein Geschäft, ja
Ich bin Untergrundkönig

Was kann ich dafür, dass er dich nicht richtig ficken kann, Nutte

Bei uns wird alles gesagt
Du nimmst alles mit in's Grab
Ich muss hart sein, keine Gnade
Wie 'ne Granate

Du musst es so seh'n
Es kommt gut an, Rap mit Blutbad
Frag jede Frau dicke Schwänze fühl'n sich gut an
Meiner ist ein Mutant
Du siehst ihn und tust dann
Was ich will
Was ich will?
Ich lass' duch killen

Jetzt ist meine Zeit
Bitches machen die Beine breit
Es geht gar nicht, dass du auf meiner Party alleine bleibst
Ich steh' auf Bräute mit 'nem Hang zur Arroganz
Auch wenn sie tanzt, sie will nur meinen Schwanz
Die ganze Nacht ficken wie ein Tier, tja so ist das
(Ah) Pussys essen meinen Schwanz auf wie Whiskas
Und ihr wisst das
Doch wollt's nicht einseh'n
Ich kann machen was ich will, denn das ist mein Leben
Verbiete mich so viel du willst, doch ich mach' weiter
Wenn du mich störst, schieb' ich dich einfach zur Seite
Auch wenn, meine Art zu ficken für dich billig ist
Mach dir keinen Kopf um die Braut, genauso will sie es

Cause my wrist bone's connected to the hand bone's connected to the
Jizz nasty I can never let it walk on by
Why do I feel so high when it strikes mid-knight in shining armor
Cybernetic snake charmer

Your sweat glands and pores in your skin 
Release spores from within leviathan
Can't hang unless you swing by the neck
Untempered instrumentals got you smooth 
As thinking continental cruise
Your core bruise until your spine and
Press rewind too many times
And catch several shurikens
To your mind and soul as I swallow it whole
I see you grippin' on

Soldiers controlling civilians
Deploy the daredevil dimension
Competition cringes
They couldn't get open if they came equipped with hinges
Addicted to dope injected by swollen syringes
This flame thrower singes and burns you to a crisp of ashes
I'm ill suffer from constant hot flashes
Bad rock annihilates violator retaliates
Vertibreaker will mutilate
Ghost causing sirens
Hands of hostility strangling evil tyrants
Who worship the power plant I've seen many strange things
Protect the sacred circle and beware of the changelings

Labyrinth spreading chaotic activity
Wide open door frivolling away like cumulus clouds
Your a black rose lost in my black flag
Motel strange corridors
With the only sensor receptacles receiving technical difficulties
Mics philiac ?
No gimmicks
A patch over your left eye

While the venomous
Serum leaks in your heart print
Indent a paragraph and the message is sent
Transparent sentiments
That are radioactive
And leave a fritz like apocalypse
Leaving the former ?
Attempt your consciousness like triplets
Back to back to back like ?
In a foreign country we still excavate doves
Isolate you to a torture

Remains of no life just cold breezes and past souls
Mistaking fake saviors
Blessed in his own castle
Now its just relics left back ?

You guard your heart, so they steal your sight
You reach out in blindness, touch the alone
His icicle fingers chill you to the bone

What do you do when the cat gets ya tongue?
No way to tell it's all going wrong
Mouth out the words on the telephone
Nobody answers, nobody's home...

No, I'll stand up again and I'll run
I'll jump up till I touch the sun
Because I won't be the one to be bound
By the sound of ""If only, if only, if only""

Well, I reach out in blindness now, but what do I care?
I'll walk into walls and I'll stumble downstairs
I'll laugh like a fishwife, I'll cry like a clown
Up is the only way to go when you're down

When I reach a mountain top, then I start to climb
I'll walk on the water, I'll turn water to wine
Hope is the one thing we got on our side
Hope can be salvaged when all else has died

Cuando delante de todos te prometí,
Que la vida podría fallarme alguna vez
Pero que pasaría el tiempo junto a ti
Lo tengo todo mas de lo que un día pensé
Pero sin ti no tengo na
No se que hacer
Saque la puntuación mas alta en el amor
Sin ti de nada vale

Tengo un gran conocimiento
Yo mas que eso tengo un doctorado
Tengo el corazón graduado en sentimiento
Con la nota que jamas nadie a alcanzado

Tengo mis sueños contigo
Todo lo que se tu me lo has enseñado
Nada de lo que yo conozco es fingido

Todo lo que tengo
Mas o menos lo perdí

No se como hacer sin ti
Teniendo todo o nada
Me queda sin ti
De que me vale (de que me vale)
Si tu no estas aquí a mi lado de nada me vale

No se como hacer sin ti
Teniendo todo o nada me queda sin ti
De que me vale
Los mil diplomas mil honores
De nada me vale

Vivo enamorado y loco
Yo sin ti vivo fracasado y loco
Si tu no estas aquí,
Aquí a mi lado de nada vale ya
Lo que se y mi doctorado

Vivo enamorado y loco
Yo sin ti vivo fracasado y loco
Si tu no estas aquí,
Aquí a mi lado de nada vale ya
Lo que se y mi doctorado

Para que quiero un castillo
Si esta sólito ya no tiene reina
Para que vivir hacia sufrido
Si tengo tantas ganas de vivir
Y muero de amor

No se como hacer sin ti
Teniendo todo o nada me queda sin ti
De que me vale

Si tu no estas aquí a mi lado
De nada me vale

No se como hacer sin ti
Teniendo todo o nada me queda sin ti
De que me vale

Los mil diplomas mil honores
De nada me valen

Vivo enamorado y loco
Yo sin ti vivo fracasado y loco
Si tu no estas aquí,
Aquí a mi lado de nada vale ya
Lo que se y mi doctorado

Vivo enamorado y loco
Yo sin ti vivo fracasado y loco
Si tu no estas aquí,
Aquí a mi lado de nada vale ya
Lo que se y mi doctorado

Vivo enamorado y loco
Yo sin ti vivo fracasado y loco

Que fracase

Rindiéndose a los pies de quien nos robó le corazón

Camina por las calles del corazón tuyo
Pidiendo como un limosnero
Ámame por favor ábreme el corazón
No ves que me mata el silencio mientras callas
No se como pedirte mas que no te vayas

Si tu me has visto cerquita del corazón tuyo
Es porque a tu lado construyo
Una casita pa vivirla mientras poco a poco sufro y me destruyo
Amarte a ti es mi pasatiempo
El tuyo es irte como el viento
Ignorando mis sentimientos mientras yo muriendo
Quedo en la nada

Me hice promesas yo mismo me juré olvidarte
Y no tuve fuerzas
Solo las tengo para amarte
Amame por favor o arrancame el corazón
No ves que me mata el silencio mientras callas
No se como pedirte mas que no te vayas

Una casita pa vivirla mientras poco a poco sufro y me destruyo
Amarte ya es mi pasatiempo el tuyo irte como el viento

Tony Dize,"Llevo días sin poder dormir
Lo único que hago es pensar en ti
Afuera está lloviendo
Y hace frío aquí

Quiero dormir contigo calientito
Al lado tuyo acurrucaito
Mi cuarto no es el mismo si no estás

Otra melodía más
Para ustedes

Y se me va el sueño
Si no te tengo
Ya nada es lo mismo si no estás
(Tercer álbum, Pina Records)
Y se me va el sueño
Si no te tengo
Ya nada es lo mismo si no estás (Tony Dize, Farruko)

No puedo dormir en las noches
Siento que mi cama da vueltas
Te quiero aquí, cerca de mi
Siento que esta espera me mata

La brisa de la lluvia trae el olor de tu cuerpo
Y el agua se convierte en nieve
Se me congela el alma, el tiempo se detiene
Y me duele

Uh, uh, uh donde estarás
Uh, uh, uh, uh
Uh, uh, uh vuelve ya
Uh, uh, uh, uh

Y se me va el sueño
Si no te tengo
Ya nada es lo mismo si no estás
Y se me va el sueño
Si no te tengo
Ya nada es lo mismo si no estás (Luian, she needs this in her life)

Y yo me siento vacío, perdido
Como ciego buscando una luz en la oscuridad
Solo déjame verte
Hay como hago para poder tenerte

Desear que te quedes aquí para siempre
Te sigo esperando a ver si me devuelves
Lo que te llevaste, hace varios meses
Si nada cambio

Casi va amanecer y sigo aquí despierto
He llegado hasta la sala persiguiendo el sueño
Pero si tu no estas dime como lo encuentro
Las noches sin dormir están haciendo efecto

El reflejo tuyo sigue aquí en mi espejo
Obligándome hacer cosas, que no quiero

Uh, uh, uh vuelve y veras
Uh, uh, uh, uh
El tiempo que se va no regresa

Y se me va el sueño

Ya nada es lo mismo si no estás

Tony Dize,"Sé que dicen que has perdido la cordura
Y que eso de amarme tanto no es normal
Que has llegado al límite de la locura
Y que ha puesto en duda tu salud mental

Sé que dicen que también me he vuelto loco
Y quizás un poco
Pero es por vez por el miedo de quedarme solo
Y no verte más
Comprenden que este amor es verdadero
Por ti pongo mis manos en el fuego
Y nos dicen locos por saber amar

Y me hace falta el calor de tus caricias
Conversar juntos frente al mar, bajo la brisa
Y me hace falta escuchar aquella dulce voz
Que me enamoró
Si es por eso estoy loco de amor

Dime que hago sentado en la cama
A cada noche, a cada madrugada
Sueño despierto, siento que haces falta
Y me desvelo hablando con mi almohada

Hagamos de lo nuestro un sueño roto
Por qué hacerlo pedazos si aún te siento
Cuando recuerdo esos momento a tu lado y no te encuentro
Te tengo y no te tengo

Te extraño, todo pasa cuando más te necesitaba yo
Por qué todo falló
No me explico no no
Hoy trato de sanar lo que tu adiós dejó
Pongo mis fuerzas pero no, no es suficiente para olvidar

Y me hace falta el calor de tus caricias
Conversar juntos bajo el mar, bajo la brisa
Y me hace falta escuchar, aquella dulce voz
Que me enamoró
Si es por eso estoy loco de amor

Otra vez pienso en ti
Hoy creo que estas allí
Cómo me engaño así
Cómo si, nunca te vi

Te hago daño, no sé si has estado igual
No sé si dormir, ni como seguir aguantando
Me la paso maldiciendo, por dejarle todo el tiempo
Y entre tantos sufrimientos
Tengo que ser feliz

Ver tus retratos me hace sentirte aquí
Aunque esta realidad es así
Que me obliga a seguir
Te imagino sin mi

Ver tus retratos me hace sentirte aquí
Aunque esta realidad es así
Que me obliga a seguir

Y me hace falta el calor de tus caricias
Conversar juntos frente el mar, bajo la brisa
Y me hace falta escuchar, aquella dulce voz
Que me enamoró
Si es por eso, estoy loco de amor",Al Limite de la Locura,2015

(En el nombre del padre, del hijo y del espíritu santo, amen)

Tres excusas en mi mente para recordar que vivo (papa atención)
Esperándome en casa y casi no llego
Otra vez sé que esos niños, preguntan por papa
Van creciendo y tantas cosas que hoy quisiera repetirlos (me hace una falta)
Con guitarras cantando me imitan
Pueden todo conseguirlo

Se levantan buscando, inquietos me abrazan
Locos contando, todo lo que les pasa
Pero cuando suplican por quedarme de ellos no me despido
Fallarles, su sacrificio, voy perdiendo su infancia
Que compromiso, mantener una distancia
Donde todo es fantasía y no basta en cantarle al olvido

Hijo me salva la vida grabarlo allí (gracias señor)
De tenerlos aquí (por mis padres)
Me recuerdan a mi (hoy tengo una familia)

Estoy ahí aunque quisiera detenerlos aquí
Busco su historia y me recuerdan a mí
Porque complicarles la vida
Si ellos son tan feliz cuando estoy ahí",Aunque Quisiera Detenerlo,2015

Que tienes a alguien
Que tienes a alguien

Pero que no te da el placer que yo
Te ofrezco en este momento
Y luego si tú quieres, ni te conocí
Y luego si tú quieres, yo jamás te vi

Cuando la timidez se detuvo
Bajando las botellas y el humo
Recuerdo tu cuerpo desnudo

Cuando la timidez se detuvo
Bajando las botellas y el humo

Ya resumí la nota que te sube
Caliente, tienes un fuego que me consume
Un porte femenino que me induce a tirarle
Quererlo repetir inevitable es

A pesar del acuerdo en que llegamos
Que nisiquiera nos comunicamos
Tengo alucinaciones, voces, luces
En todas la posiciones que te puse

En esa, quiero sentir que eres mía
Darte lo tuyo, como aquel día
Y terminar en el suelo sudando
Todavía te siento susurrando

En esa, quiero sentir que eres mía
Darte lo tuyo, como aquel día
Y terminar en el suelo sudando
Todavía te siento susurrando

Cuando la timidez se detuvo
Bajando las botellas y el humo
Recuerdo tu cuerpo desnudo
Como entre sus piernas estuve

Estoy pensando no más que en ti
No pudo someterme a aquel acuerdo
He tratado de olvidarte ya
Pero no resuelvo

Ninguna me lo ha vuelto hacer como tú
Nadie me toca como lo haces tú
No hay nadie como tú sin ropa, tu mirada, tu boca
Tan caliente como lo haces tú

Ninguna me lo ha vuelto hacer como tú
Nadie me toca como lo haces tú
No hay nadie como tú sin ropa, tu mirada, tu boca
Tan caliente como tu

Nada está de más
Solo una mirada me hizo descifrar
Que tienes a alguien

De nada sirve que trates de detenerte
Eso no va conmigo te conozco bien
No es la primera vez que te daño la mente
Apuesto lo que sea que lo hará otra vez

Porque yo sé, que a ti gusta así
Y te haces de rogar
Sabiendo lo que quiero, oh oh oh
A mi me gusta así, que se hagan de rogar
Y terminen cayendo

Sabes que yo siempre te converso
Comenzaremos así despacio
Aprovechemos que queda tiempo
Aunque ya me estoy desesperando
Y es que con ese piquete que tiene
Me obliga a darle como se debe
Esto a pasado ya varias veces
Falta poquito para que me la vuelva a llevar

Sí yo sé, que a ti gusta así
Y te haces de rogar
Sabiendo lo que quiero, oh oh oh
A mi me gusta así, que se hagan de rogar
Y terminen cayendo

Si nos iremos al final yo ni entiendo
Porque me esquivas dime que es lo que pasa
Me desespero y sé que lo haces por eso
Estas haciendo que te coja más ganas
Desde hace ratos la malicia corriendo
Cuando me miras y no me dices nada
Sigo esperando que el alcohol te haga efecto
De esa manera tu conmigo no amarras (hear this)

De nada sirve que trates de detenerte
Eso no va conmigo te conozco bien
No es la primera vez que te daño la mente

Eres mi amiga y no sé cómo
Expresarme sin confundirte
De ti yo quiero algo pero no es amor

A poca luz
Quiero ver tu cuerpo y toda tu virtud
Tengo intenciones atrevidas
Es que tú te vez tan atractiva y me motivas

Y es que tú
Provocas en mi mente deseos
Y como pretendes que no te piense
De la manera que te pienso yo

Sí es que tú
Te me acercas y me tientas con tu olor
Como hago pa’ no hacerte un indecente
Diciéndote lo que pretendo contigo, contigo

Me llevas al espacio cuando tú me caminas
Con esa camisita y el pantalón
Me acuerdo el primer día, yo ni te conocía
Y terminamos hablando en mi habitación

Contigo me confundo
Si solo con hablar tú me cambias de mundo
Y no es que ando buscando algo más profundo
Yo solo me conformo con un día estar juntos
Y voy detrás de ti
Buscando que quieras de mi, ah
Dime si quieres salir
Porque esta noche quiero repetir
Ah

Y voy detrás de ti

Como hago pa' no hacerte un indecente
Diciéndote lo que pretendo contigo

Es que me das mucha ganas
Cada vez que te veo
Solo eres mi amiga pero yo no creo
Que esto nos afecte luego
Somos adultos y sabemos
Si pasas por curiosidad
No envuelvas sentimientos

Dejemos que pasen las cosas
Cuando un cuerpo desea otro ya quien lo controla
Quieres ser fuerte de mente pero te traiciona
Terminas haciendo lo que se te antoja

Por eso disfrútate el momento
Hagámoslo pero sin arrepentimientos
Vamos hacerlo sin ninguna duda
Pa' que vivir la vida con tanta atadura

Y es que tú
Provocas en mi mente deseos
Y como pretendes que no te piense

No estoy tranquilo cuando aquí me tienes
Adivinando si quieres
A mi pensamiento siempre vienes
Me he acostumbrado a sentir que tú
De lejos prefieras lo mismo y decías que sí

Duele el amor
Cuando la venganza se ha llevado todo
Tanto así que te marcharás
Y quedaré sin nada

Duele el amor
Cuando la venganza
Se ha llevado todo
Tanto así que te marcharás
Y quedaré sin nada

Duele el amor
Pero mas duele verte
Sabiendo que no volveré a tener
Se que te marchas y ahora es para siempre
Que la venganza pasa por tu mente

Y ahí es cuando el alma se envenena
Matando lo poquito que nos queda
No vale la pena vivir en guerra
Cuando sabemos que no quedan fuerzas

Aunque no es momento
Dime para que seguir insistiendo
Lastimandonos y discutiendo
Para luego terminar huyendo
Sabes bien que fuimos solos tú y yo en esto
Que nadie sabe la verdad y todo este tiempo

Duele el amor
Cuando la venganza se ha llevado todo
Tanto así que te marcharás
Y quedaré sin nada

Duele el amor
Cuando la venganza

Hoy dejaré que te vayas aunque me haga daño
Admito que también yo necesito espacio
Y por el momento será mejor alejarnos
Que dios decida si es que volverá a juntarnos
Hoy te dejaré en las manos los recuerdos
Capaces de acabar con el resentimiento
Y por lo que tus ojos estoy viendo
Yo me quedaré sin nada lo presiento, ya lo sé

Me tropecé con tu mirar y aún
No estoy tranquilo cuando aqui me tienes

Y ven regálame una noche
Solo finge que me amas
Para guardar ese recuerdo
Por si ya no estás mañana

Ven regálame otra noche
Solo finge que me amas
Para guardar recuerdos
Por si ya no estás mañana

Ven regálame una noche

Yo sé que va a pasar después
Tranquila que yo sigo mi camino

Pero dame mas recuerdos pa' llevarme de tu piel
Y busca otro destino porque detrás de ti yo no voy a correr

Esta vez serás mi girl y mañana serás mi ex
Pero aquí te espero si algún día quieras volver
Siempre y cuando no me dejes esperando
Puede ser que por ahí llegue otra mujer

Y me toque a mi fingir que yo la amo
Y saber si me enamoro sin querer
Ven aquí acabemos con esto
Tú decides lo que pase luego

Cuando llegamos a la cama
Solo finge que me amas
Que yo me encargare del resto

Para guardar recuerdos
Por si ya no estás mañana

Regálame el último beso
De esos que el primer día
Las partes de mi cuerpo
Mientras te hacia mía
Y sé que ya no sientes amor
Que todo eso cambio, pensé que eras mía
Me hice ironía

Yo en tu cuerpo en la cama lo note
Ya tú no eres la misma conmigo
Tú que solo lo hacías por placer
Por mi ya no sentías mas amor
Pero no lucharé y me resignaré
Al fin de que sientas amor mañana todo termino
Imagina lo vamos hacer
Por primera vez que todo es perfecto
Pensemos que nada paso

Y solamente hagamos sexo
Por última vez
Un encuentro de una noche
Mañana me voy muy lejos
Y no me llames
Permíteme ser tu amante

Espero que no lo tomes en serio
Y más bien escucha lo que te digo

Yo no pretendo enamorarte
Yo soy así las trato bien
Esto que pasa entre nosotros
Nadie lo tiene que saber

No quiero que le pongas nombre
A lo que hacemos por placer
Para que tomarnos de la mano
Mírame y dime para que

No me valió la pena
Es tiempo de hablarnos claro
Cortar por lo sano y decirnos adiós

Ya me cansé de dormir en la misma cama
Y dejar en la cocina nuestras ganas
Y me duele sentirte tan fría
Si tú no eres mía

Amor yo
Yo no te quiero tener ni en la mente
No quiero jugar a la suerte
Ruleta rusa, bala de muerte, es tenerte

Amor yo
Yo no te quiero tener ni en la mente
No quiero jugar a la suerte
Ruleta rusa, bala de muerte
Es tenerte y no tenerte

¿Qué nos pasa?
¿Qué me pasa que yo no consigo?
Despertar este amor que contigo
Yo le jure a dios cuidarlo
Y aunque duela aceptarlo

La casa se ha vuelto tan fría
Te miro pero no me miras
Te extraño teniéndote cerca
Te amo y me duele ver como se seca
Nuestro amor

Yo no te quiero tener ni en la mente
No quiero jugar a la suerte
Ruleta rusa, bala de muerte, es tenerte

Te amo
Porque en mi solo viste lo mejor

Si yo te llego a perder
Yo no sé que haré sin tus besos, tu boca
Sin lo bien que me tocas
Solo tú me entiendes a mi
Y acepto soy difícil
Tú me calmas y no te enojas
Eso mas me enamora
Contigo soy feliz

Eres lo mejor, que me ha pasado
Tienes un bonito cuerpo y un interior que amo
Quiero tenerte por siempre aquí
Eres la única que me hace felíz
Si me escuchas peleando me brindas un abrazo
Lo malo se muere en el acto

Tú y yo siempre terminamos, haciendo el amor

De que me puedo quejar
Si tu amor me conforta
Me besas y nada mas importa

Son difícil de encontrar

Como llenar ese espacio vació en mi cama
Si tú te vas yo te prometo amor
Que me quedo solito
Me llevas al cielo con tus caricias
Me envuelvo con tu mirada tan genuina
Con tan solo mirarte me alegras la vida
Con solo un beso tuyo lo malo se olvida

Es como tener una corta en la cintura
Que te asegura, que el seguro esta puesto

Con ella se te acaban las aventuras
Un paso en falso y te dará un escarmiento
Es como sacarla corta de la cintura
Es una cura, cada vez que la aprieto

Por eso anda suelta por ahí
Cazando despacio
Anda por ahí
Si entra en acción, aquí va a pasar algo

Por eso anda suelta por ahí
Cazando despacio
Anda por ahí
Si entra en acción, aquí va a pasar algo

Muchos no saben que ando ready cuando salgo
Por si acaso pillo alguno nebuliando
Siempre con ella y aunque no quiero problema
El que se preste, sabrá que no estoy jugando
Yo sé de muchos que se jugaron la carta
Y titubearon cuando la vieron de frente
Porque de noche a ella le cambia la mirada
Si dispara, probara como se siente

La lady es peligrosa, mujer celosa
Que dispara fuego, cuando se pone ansiosa
Viciosa de la calle, que no da detalle
Y que me dice Ñengo apriétame apriétame hasta que estalle
Su vida siempre está loca
Es una demente, puede lastimar a la gente yo yo yo
Se van a quedar inconsciente, cuando
Mi mami se ponga fulete, en cona

Mi nena no se tranca da cara por mi
Si ve que hace falta
Yo que tu no me juego esa carta
Si eso pasa, aquí nadie se salva

De un viaje para patricio, si te azoto con la nena
Siete pies, un poco de arena y tu nombre ya no suena
Explosiva, ella es mi diva
La que los los brinca para arriba y los asesina
Somos el unos para el otro y yo muero por mi mami
Ready anda conmigo, para forma el party
Donde sea, a la hora que sea y escucha bien
Si hay que pistolear, pistolea también

Porque nuestra historia terminó
Ya me marcho, pero antes de irme
Bésame y hagamos el amor

Esta noche quiero hacerte mía
Porque presiento que es el final
Llévate contigo mis caricias
Por si acaso no nos vemos más

Justo cuando decidí recuperarte
Sin una buena explicación decidiste marcharte
Y después de tantas cosas que callaste
Te faltó el valor o cual fue la razón de no preguntarme

Fue una mala decisión
Aquí tienes mi contestación
Pero la desesperación que te llevo a aquel error
Por creer que ocuparon mi espacio, y no

Aquí tienes mi contestación
Pero la desesperación que te llevo a aquel error
Por creer que ocuparon mi espacio, y no

La gente sin saber
Continuamente me preguntan
Que ha sido de ti
Por creer que ocuparon mis espacios no
Pero nada les puedo decir
Si lo veo sonreír
Inventaré algún modo para vivir sin ti

Se nos muere el amor va directo al vacío
Se nos cae en pedazos
Lo que un día construimos (oh nos construimos)
Todos aquellos sueños cuando éramos niños
Se nos han derrumbados, arruinando lo que nos prometimos

Me cansé de tu forma de ser
Porque no saber, del amor aquel
Si yo soy la luz de tu ser
Explícame como se comparte un querer

Me cansé de tu forma de ser
Porque no saber, del amor aquel
De tu indecisión que me trae confusión ya yo me cansé

Justo cuando decidí recuperarte
Sin una buena explicación decidiste marcharte
Y después de tantas cosas que callaste
Te faltó el valor o cual fue la razón de no preguntarme

Un te quiero, compartido
Algo absurdo sentimientos divididos
Has perdido la cordura
Y un adiós va en tu captura

Ho 15 anni nella Fendi hey, porca troia
Trappando con due slave nel retro di una Toyota (skrt)
Al collo tre ghiaccioli un nuovo freezer sul polso (bling bling)
Sto cantando soldi sono l’affare in questo gioco
Quando mi vede fa “wow” (oddio)
Da Gucci mi fanno “ciao” (ciao)
La mia faccia su Playboy (ehi)
Tesoro chiamami soldi (“let’s get it”)
Con un infame non hablo con la tua tipa mi scaldo
Dico soltanto verità baby puoi chiamarmi Pablo (skrt)
Yah yah

Entro nel locale festa come il primo maggio
Vendo pezzi d’arte come un Cara-Caravaggio (skrt)
Tu lo sai chi sei, con un insetto io non parlo
Perché sei uno scarafaggio scara-scara-scarafaggio

Se ora non ti spogli
Cazzo sei venuta a fare?
Se non hai portato i soldi
Cazzo sei venuto a fare?

Allaccio ste Nike sotto un pantalone stretto
Ho fatto più fatti di quante parole ho detto
Ho amici ai piani alti e amici pure giù nel ghetto
I boss e i soldati qua mi portano rispetto
Il soldo è il mio di per questo lo rispetto
Ed io il suo profeta come Allah con Maometto
Manda il tuo sicario finisci nell’acquario
Fratelli in galera e pure nell’aldilà
Che vegliano sulla mia testa e sopra la città

Scrolliamoci questi scarafaggi di dosso

Vendo pezzi d’arte come un Cara-Caravaggio (skrt)

Tony Ellis,"Now I taught the weeping willow how to cry, 
And I showed the clouds how to cover up a clear blue sky. 
And the tears that I cried for that woman are gonna flood you Big River. 
Then I'm gonna sit right here until I die. 

I met her accidentally in St. Paul (Minnesota). 
And it tore me up every time I heard her drawl, Southern drawl. 
Then I heard my dream was back Downstream cavortin' in Davenport, 
And I followed you, Big River, when you called. 

Then you took me to St. Louis later on (down the river). 
A freighter said she's been here 
But she's gone, boy, she's gone. 
I found her trail in Memphis, 
But she just walked up the block. 
She raised a few eyebrows and then she went on down alone. 

Now, won't you batter down by Baton Rouge, 
River Queen, roll it on. 
Take that woman on down to New Orleans, New Orleans. 
Go on, I've had enough; 
Dump my blues down in the gulf. 
She loves you, Big River, more than me.

Tony Ellis,"When I was young in my prime
I left my home in Caroline
Now all I do is sit and pine
For all the folks I left behind
I've got those blue ridge mountain blues
And I stand right there to say
My grip is packed to travel
And I'm scratching gravel
For that blue ridge far away

I'm gonna stay right by my Ma
I'm gonna do right by my Pa
Lay around the cabin door
No work on worry anymore
I've got those blue ridge mountain blues
What to see my old day tray
What to hunt the possum
Where the corn top blossom
On that blue ridge far away

I see a window with the light
I see two heads of snowy white
It seems I can hear them both recite
Where is my wondering boy tonight
I'm got those blue ridge mountain blues
And I stand right here to say
Every day I'm counting
Still I climb that mountain
Oh, that blue ridge far away",Blue Ridge Mountain Blues,1991

For losing you would be more than I could bear
Tho' I'm tied to another, I hope someday she'll set me free
For I don't want a cheap love affair

I knew we loved each other the night that we first met
It just happened there was nothing we could do
Let me stay with my children til they can understand
That I love them and they'll know I love you too

[Chorus]
So darling please forgive me, don't give me all the blame
Tho' I know that it doesn't seem so fair

My mama would rock me in the cradle

Tony Ellis,"Oh Danny boy, the pipes, the pipes are calling
From glen to glen, and down the mountain side
The summer's gone, and all the roses are dying
It's you, It's you must go and I must bide

But come ye back when summer's in the meadow
Or when the valley's hushed and white with snow
For I'll be here in sunshine or in shadow
Oh Danny boy, oh Danny boy, I love you so

But when ye come and all the flowers are a dying
And if I am dead, dead I well may be
Just come and find, find the place
Find the place where I lay lying
And kneel and say an ""Ave"" there for me

And I will hear tho soft you tread above me
And my grave, my grave warmer and sweeter be
For you're gonna kneel and you're gonna tell
God you're gonna tell me how you loved me
And I will sleep in peace until you come to me",Danny Boy,1991
Tony Ellis,"Out on the perilous deep
Where dangers silently creep
And storms so violently sweep
You're drifting to far from the shore

Drifting too far from the shore (from the shore)
Drifting too far from the shore (peaceful shore)
Come to Jesus today, let him show you the way
You're drifting to far from the shore

Today the tempest rolls high
And clouds overshadow the sky
Sure death is hovering nigh
You're drifting to far from the shore

Why meet a terrible fate
Mercy abundantly waits
Turn back before its to late
You're drifting to far from the shore



",Drifting Too Far from the Shore,1991
Tony Ellis,"Those pretty wild flowers I love them so well
The flowers know secrets that I'll never tell
I go out to pick a bouquet of all
And bring them all in before the leaves start to fall

When the leaves start to fall and the flowers have died
If only little darling I could be by your side
Tho' it breaks my heart to hear your name
Soon the wild flowers will bloom again in the spring

I wish I could see her and talk of our love
And of all the pretty flowers sent here from above
Oh maybe I'll see her in Heaven someday
And pick pretty flowers as we go on our way

The memories of you dear I'll never erase
There'll never be another that can take your place
I'll still keep our secret with the flowers of love
And we'll pick them together in Heaven above",Flowers of Love,1991
Tony Ellis,"Your love is colder than a foggy river
Rollin on a heart of stone
You left me stranded on this foggy river
Cold and helpless and alone

I knew someday that you would turn me down
I got worries on my mind
Yes I'm doomed to sail this foggy river
Till I leave my love behind

There's no tomorrow on this foggy river
Only memories linger on
A mist of sorrows fills this foggy river
Everything I had is gone

I can't escape this broken heart of mine
I've no freedom anymore
Heaven help me on this foggy river
Till I reach that distant shore",Foggy River,1991

Tony Ellis,"A policeman's whistle gayly, a smile upon his face
As he walked along the old familiar beat
He saw a little bay crying and thought his heart would break
Standing bare foot in the middle of the street

I was left on the street with no shoes upon my feet
When I saw my mom and daddy drive away
Now I'm not old enough to know every much myself
But I saw my dad and mommy drive away

The policeman stopped the traffic, then went up to the boy
And he asked him gently, where do you belong
The little boy stopped crying and with trembling lips he said
I'm not big enough to know just what went wrong

[Chorus:]
The little boy is happy now with a new mom and dad
His new daddy is the policeman on the beat
Tho' he can't forget that awful day it doesn't seem to hurt so bad
He has a brand new pair of shoes upon his feet

[Chorus]",I Was Left on the Street,1991
Tony Ellis,"Hear that lonesome whippoorwill
He sounds too blue to fly
The midnight train is whining low
I'm so lonesome I could cry

I've never seen a night so long
When time goes crawling by
The moon just went behind the clouds
To hide its face and cry

Did you ever see a robin weep
When leaves begin to die
That mean's he's lost his will to live
I'm so lonesome I could cry

The silence of a falling star
Lights up a purple sky
And as I wonder where you are
I'm so lonesome I could cry",I'm So Lonesome I Could Cry,1991
Tony Ellis,"It's mighty dark for me to travel
For my sweetheart she is gone
The road is rough and filled with gravel
But I must journey on and on

To me she was a little angel
Sent down to me from God above
And on the day that I first met her
Then I told her of my love

Many a night we strolled together
Talking of our love so fair
My love for her will never vanish
Oh I know I'll meet her there

Traveling down this lonesome highway
Thinking of my love who's gone
Knowing soon we'll be together
She's the only love I've known",It's Mighty Dark to Travel,1991
Tony Ellis,"We all loved our fair tender maiden
From her eyes the light of Heaven shone through
She fell sick one cold winter morning
And there was nothing we could do

She lay on her death bed so bravely
Her face all tired and worn
We knew in our hearts she was leaving
God had called her to His heavenly home

As she lay on the bed she was smiling
At the people all gathered a-round
It was her only way of saying goodbye
And tomorrow she'd lay neath the ground

The fragrance of flowers from her grave
Goes to heaven where she has gone too
Mortal pain shown on all our faces
But there was nothing we could do

When the preacher began to console us
His words rang out clear and true
He said God called her that's the reason
That there was nothing we could do",There Was Nothing We Could Do,1991
Tony Ellis,"Nobody's love is like mine
   No one so faithful and kind
   Love that is true as the ocean
   But nobody's love is like mine

They tell me that you've found another
And now you'll be going far away
Why have you left me little darling
I love you both night and day

I guess now I'll just go on dreaming
And wondering why it couldn't be
Some day little darling you'll be sorry
For the way you treated me
",Nobody's Love Is Like Mine,1994
Tony Elman,"What Child is this, who laid to rest

Whom angels greet with anthems sweet
While shepherds watch are keeping?
This, this is Christ the King
Whom shepherds guard and angels sing

The Babe, the Son of Mary

Why lies He in such mean estate
Where ox and ass are feeding?
Good Christian, fear: for sinners here
The silent Word is pleading
This, this is Christ the King
Whom shepherds guard and angels sing
Haste, haste to bring Him laud
The Babe, the Son of Mary

Nails, spear, shall pierce Him through

So bring Him incense, gold and myrrh

And there is nothing that I wouldn't do for
The rare delight of the sight of you for

The more I see you, the more I want you

With every sigh I become more mad about you
More lost without you and so it goes

Tony Ennis,"And now, the end is near
And so I face the final curtain
My friend, I'll say it clear
I'll state my case, of which I'm certain

I've lived a life that's full
I've traveled each and every highway
Oh, and more, much more than this
I did it my way

Regrets, I've had a few
But then again, too few to mention
I did what I had to do
And saw it through without exemption

I planned each charted course
Each careful step along the byway
But more, much more than this
I did it my way

Yes, there were times, I'm sure you knew
When I bit off more than I could chew
But through it all, when there was doubt
I ate it up and spit it out
I faced it all and I stood tall
And did it my way

I've loved, I've laughed and cried
Had my fill, my share of losing
And now, as tears subside
I find it all so amusing

To think I did all that
And may I say, not in a shy way
""Oh no, oh no not me
I did it my way""

For what is a man, what has he got?
If not himself, then he has naught
To say the things he truly feels
And not the words of one who kneels
The record shows I took the blows
And did it my way

The record shows I took the blows
And did it my way",My Way,2000
Tony Ennis,"And now the purple dusk of twilight time
Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb
Always reminding me that we're apart
You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms
The nightingale 
Tells his fairytale
Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain
My stardust melody
The memory of love's refrain.",Stardust,2000

They say the women treat you fine

But lookin' at them just gives me the blues

And one thin dime won't even shine your shoes

Tony Fontaine,"Walked with no one and talked with no one
And I had nothing but shadows
Then one morning you passed
And I brightened at last
Now I greet the day and complete the day
With the sun in my heart
All my worry blew away
When you taught me how to say

Grab your coat and get your hat
Leave your worry on the doorstep
Just direct your feet
To the sunny side of the street
Can't you hear a pitter-pat?
And that happy tune is your step
Life can be so sweet
On the sunny side of the street

I used to walk in the shade
With those blues on parade
But I'm not afraid
This Rover crossed over

If I never have a cent
I'd be rich as Rockefeller
Gold dust at my feet
On the sunny side of the street
Grab your street",On the Sunny Side of the Street,2001
Tony Fontane,"I’m pressing on the upward way
New heights I’m gaining every day
Still praying as I’m onward bound
Lord, plant my feet on higher ground
 
Lord, lift me up and let me stand
By faith, on Heaven’s tableland
A higher plane than I have found
Lord, plant my feet on higher ground
 
My heart has no desire to stay
Where doubts arise and fears dismay
Though some may dwell where those abound
My prayer, my aim, is higher ground
 
Lord, lift me up and let me stand
By faith, on Heaven’s tableland
A higher plane than I have found
Lord, plant my feet on higher ground
 
I want to live above the world
Though Satan’s darts at me are hurled
For faith has caught the joyful sound
The song of saints on higher ground
 
Lord, lift me up and let me stand
By faith, on Heaven’s tableland
A higher plane than I have found
Lord, plant my feet on higher ground
 
I want to scale the utmost height
And catch a gleam of glory bright
But still I’ll pray, 'till heaven I’ve found
Lord, plant my feet on higher ground",Higher Ground,2005
Tony Fougerat,"I hate to see that evening sun go down
I hate to see that evening sun go down
Cause my baby, he's gone left this town

Feelin' tomorrow like I feel today
If I'm feelin' tomorrow like I feel today
I'll pack my truck and make my give-a-way

St. Louis woman with her diamond ring
Pulls that man around by her, if it wasn't for her and her
That man I love would have gone nowhere, nowhere

I got the St. Louis blues, blues as I can be
That man's got a heart like a rock cast in the sea

I knew for sure, I knew for sure
Always knew it was them or me

They don't know like I know
And I can't stop 'cause it drives them crazy

It drives them crazy, 'cause I won't be cool
It's too late baby

It's  the same old desire
Nothing has changed, nothing's the same

Don't you ever take my name in vain

Always moving, somewhere else to be
Moving on, moving on
Scream at you and you scream at me
Right or wrong, right or wrong

No one's ever gonna take us away
'Cause they don't know like I know
I gotta keep rockin', 'cause it makes me crazy

Tony Franklin,"And here, my prize, the Black Widow. 
Isn't she lovely? And so deadly. 
Her kiss is fifteen times more poisonous than the rattlesnake. 
And you see her venom is highly neurotoxic 
Which is to say that it attacks the central nervous system 
Causing intense pain
Profuse sweating
Difficulty in breathing
Loss of consciousness
Violent convulsions 
And finally death. 
You know what I think I love the most about her 
Is her inborn need to dominate and possess. 
Such power and dignity, unhampered by sentiment. 
If I may put forward a slice of personal philosophy
I feel that man has ruled this world as a stumbling dimented child-king long enough!
And as his empire crumbles, my precious Black Widow shall rise as his most fitting successor! 

These words he speaks are true
We're all humanary stew
If we don't pledge allegiance to
The Black Widow

The horror that he'll brings
The horror of his sting
The unholiest of kings
The Black Widow

Our minds will be destroyed
And every girl and boy
Will learn to be employed
The Black Widow

Love me
Yes we love me
Love him
Yes we love him
Love me
Yes we love him, oh

He sits upon his throne
And picks at all the bones
Of his husbands and his wives
He's devoured
He stares with a gleam
With a laugh so obscene
and the children and the virgins
He's deflowered

Love me
Yes we love me
Love him
Yes we love him
Love me
Yes we love him, oh

Our thoughts are hot and crazed
Our dreams are webbed in haze
Mindless, senseless daze
The Black Widow

These words he speaks are true
We're all humanary stew
If we don't pledge allegiance to
Ha-ha-ha, the Black Widow

The Black Widow
Sets free, oh, the children to me

On your pillow at night

Just one more time the reasons why you must leave,
Tell me once more why you're sure you don't need me,
Tell me again but, don't think that you'll convince me.

Now you've said,
Before falling in love again you'd rather be dead,
'Cause when someone breaks your heart, you cry your eyes red,
But there's nothing so hard about the life that you've led.

As far as I can see,
There's no reason for goodbyes,
You're just running scared,
And that's something I won't buy.

So you lose,
I won't let you go with nothing to show but more blues,
And all this talk about leaving is strictly bad news,
So you settle down and stay with the man that loves you.

Mi Vida Loca my crazy life 
And as I describe how crazy my life is 
Or should I say my life before 
I opened the doors 
To the world of show biz 
I was a troubled kid 
I never gave a second thought to the things I did 
Quick to get up off on them fools who run up 
Down for any situation that would come up 
Zero tolerance which means I put up with nada 
I'm rolling on the boulevard with the raza 
If you were cool, I was cool, cool 
Trip, I gotta act the fool 
School you quicker than your school teacher 
No split decision I straight cold beat ya 
With bare hands I grab you around your throat and choke ya 
Don't mess with my crazy life, mi vida loca 
My crazy life 
At the age of twelve I started packing a knife 
Back then, gangbanging was all but fun 
At the age of fourteen I started packing a gun 
It was a .32 Berretta 
And there was no way in hell that I would ever let a 
Dumb punk sissy start talking smack 
Or work with a smirk and peel this cap 
Quicker than your ass could peel an orange 
Give me a reason any reason little boy it's on 
It's like that I'm not afraid to provoke ya 
My crazy life, mi vida loca

Tony Gato,"And now the purple dusk of twilight time
Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb
Always reminding me that we're apart
You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms
The nightingale 
Tells his fairytale
Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain
My stardust melody
The memory of love's refrain.",Stardust,2009
Tony Glover,"I'd rather be the devil, to be that woman's man

Aw, nothin' but the devil, changed my baby's mind 
Was nothin' but the devil, changed my baby's mind 

I laid down last night, laid down last night 
I laid down last night, tried to take my rest 
My mind got to ramblin', like a wild geese 
From the west, from the west

Woman I loved, took her from my best friend

I'll never fall again.
Said I do to love,
Don't ever call again.
For I must have you
Or no one.
That's why I'm thru with love.

I've locked my heart.
I keep my feelings there.
I have stopped my heart
Like an icy frigidaire.
For I need to care for no one.
That's why I'm thru with love.

Why did you leave me
To think that you cared.
You didn't need me.
You have your share
of slaves around you
To hound you and swear
Their deep devotion.
Emotion.

Did you good by the spring 
And all it meant to me
a good neighbor 
The things that used to be.
For I must have you or no one.

Tony Goddard,"It was cruel of you to stand at my door and take my hand
Like a drowning man I clung to my defenses
And ten years is a time but your looks, love, it's a crime
And I lost my tongue in the tangle of my senses
And I never was to know that I'd come to miss you so
But time winds down and I turned my back long ago

But I still dream, oh darling I still dream
Oh I still dream, oh Lord knows I still dream

On the killing floor I stand with a stun gun in my hand
Like a cowboy shooting badmen on the range
And nothing satisfies and the soul inside me dies
As I duck each punch and never risk the change
And now you look at me with that same old used-to-be
Oh but time winds down and I turned my back long ago

But I still dream, oh darling I still dream

Ah but now you look at me with that same old used-to-be
But time winds down and I turned my back long ago

How good it was when you were here
And it ain't the wine that I been drinking
For once I feel my head is clear

But early this morning, when I opened up my eyes
That old lonesome feeling took me by surprise
I guess you meant more to me than I realized
The love we had stays on my mind
The love we had stays on my mind

And lately girl, I've been remembering
The good times that we used to share
My thoughts of you don't have an ending
And memories of you are everywhere

But why should I tell you, it's not your concern
You win some, you lose some
Well I've lost and I've learned
Sisqo's so lonely
With no place to turn
And here at the end, I find
Yes I do

The love we had stays on my mind
Girl, if you were nearer
If you had a mirror
Maybe you could count my tears

And if you were nearer
It would all be clearer
How I wish that you were here
How I wish that you were here
How I wish, how I wish
How I wish that you were here

And baby girl I was tired
So I laid down to dream for a little while
But lately I've been so, so uninspired
Without the comfort of your smile

But I'm not complaining
Cuz that's how it goes
There's always some heartache
In this world I suppose
But you can't imagine
But nobody knows

You said that you loved me; said hurt only came to pass me.
It sounded so convincing that I gave it half a chance
And learned the ways of love, my baby.
There is so much love inside me,
And all that I have I'll give my all to you;
All, all my love, baby and:

All this love is waiting for you, my baby, my sugar;
And all this love is waiting for you.

Doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo 
She wears them high steppin shoes and her dress seems to fit so right

I got a 3 dollar shirts on she got 55 dollar hair 
I want to pick her up and take her down but she's already been there probably two times

And every time I see her I just cry 
Ain't no sense in even wondering why 
She don't care about me 

I know she lives on 4th street or somewhere round about all 
I want to do is hold her hand or hang her dirty laundry out 
She's got a sister names Alice her older brother's name is bill 
She ain't got no dentist but her teeth are shiny still

About the things that we've done and seen
Stories of wine glutton and glory
And the occasional altered dreams

Appetites for memories grow
As the sunshine begins to fade
Across the hill it's the same old chill
Lurking right there in the shade

Just a child with bright eyes and a smile
Laughter was all she knew
Her mama was away and all papa did was pray
So the wanderlust slowly grew

She spread her wings and a couple other things
For the medicine man downtown
With his bottle of elixir he said that he would fix her
And soon she was going down

And everyone begins to look the same
Feel the burn from the same old evil flame
We watched her fall from sweet and kind
And I wish she could come back sweet Magdeline

She was gone on a bad trip
Followed by a needle and a silver spoon
Mama sat and cried and papa told us lies
Said she'd be back real soon

Suddenly the seasons changed
From the fall back to the spring
Answers live like peasants here
When the questions reign as king

And everyone begins to look the same
Feel the burn from the same old evil flame
We watched her fall from sweet and kind
And I wish she could come back sweet Magdeline

Laughter was all she knew
Mama was away and papa sat and prayed
While the wanderlust that slowly grew

She spread her wings and wanted to do things
For the medicine man downtown
And with his bottle of elixir he said that he would fix her
And soon she was, soon she was going down, yeah

Wind was sitting and the leaves fell a hinting a sign of the near winter's ball 
Chill in the air as I strolled down the front steps looking for a tale to tell 
Then she slipped me a stare as I slid into my chair she already knew me too well 

She said hello in that beautiful voice my reply was nowhere as sweet 
She seemed impressed by the state of my mess laughed at the wings on my feet 
Offered me a cigarette and before I could even refuse 
We were standing alone she was chilled to the bone she told me to sing the blues 

[Chorus:] 
Hey hey now I feel alright and I just wanted to see 
If I may if I might be the king of your world tonight 
So I told her of the books I'd read and details about the time I stole 6 dollars from a man named Jed just to turn around and pay him back 

I quoted my favorite poem but I ended it terribly wrong 
She said I understand then she clapped both her hands and said that's my favorite song 

[Chorus]

Just then a man walked in and took her away she said her sweet goodbye

Just because you've packed your bags 
That doesn't mean that you won't return

Don't you know I'll be your fool again 

My friends tell me that they doubt it 
When I tell them I can learn to live without it

You walk out on me when we both disagree
'Cause to reason is not what you care for

I've heard it all a million time before
Take off your coat, my love, and close the door

Don't sleep in the subway, darlin'
Don't stand in the pouring rain
Don't sleep in the subway, darlin'
The night is long
Forget your foolish pride
Nothing's wrong
Now you're beside me again

You try to be smart, then you take it to heart
'Cause it hurts when your ego is deflated
You don't realize that it's all compromise
And the problems are so overrated

Goodbye means nothing when it's all for show
So why pretend you've somewhere else to go

Don't sleep in the subway, darlin'
Don't stand in the pouring rain
Don't sleep in the subway, darlin'
The night is long
Forget your foolish pride
Nothing's wrong
Now you're beside me again

Don't sleep in the subway, darlin'...",Don't Sleep in the Subway,1994
Tony Hatch,"My love is warmer than the warmest sunshine
Softer than a sigh.
My love is deeper than the deepest ocean
Wider than the sky.
My love is brighter than the brightest star 
That shines every night above
And there is nothing in this world
That can ever change my love

Something happended to my heart the day that I met you
Something that I never felt before
You are always on my mind no matter what I do
And everyday it seems that I want you more

My love is warmer than the warmest sunshine
Softer than a sigh.
My love is deeper than the deepest ocean
Wider than the sky.
My love is brighter than the brightest star 
That shines every night above
And there is nothing in this world
That can ever change my love
Once I thought that love was meant for anyone else but me
Once I thought you'd never come my way
Now it only goes to show how wrong we all can be
For now I have to tell you everyday 

My love is warmer than the warmest sunshine
Softer than a sigh
My love is deeper than the deepest ocean
Wider than the sky
My love is brighter than the brightest star 
That shines every night above
And there is nothing in this world
That can ever change my love
My love is warmer than the warmest sunshine
Softer than a sigh

That shines every night above
And there is nothing in this world
That can ever change my love",My Love,1994
Tony Hatch,"Every day when the work is behind you
And the shop and the store put the lock on the door
Just get away where your worries won't find you
If you like, well I'll tell you more

Don't let the day get the better of you
When the evening comes there's so much to do
You better put on your best and wear a smile
Just come along with me awhile, 'cause I tell you

[Chorus:]
I know a place where the music is fine
And the lights are always low
I know a place where we can go

At the door there's a man who will greet you
Then you go downstairs to some tables and chairs
Soon I'm sure you'll be tappin' your feet
Because the beat is the greatest there

All around there are girls and boys
It's a swingin' place, a cellar full of noise
It's got an atmosphere of its own somehow
You gotta come along right now 'cause I tell you

Tony Hatch,"When life doesn't seem worth the living
And you don't really care who you are
When you feel there is no one beside you
Look for a star

When you know you're alone and so lonely
And your friends have traveled afar
There is someone waiting to guide you
Look for a star

Oh everyone has a lucky star
That shines in the sky up above
If you wish on a lucky star
You're sure to find someone to love

A rich man man, a poor man, a beggar
No matter whoever you are
There's a friend who's waiting to guide you

Tony Hatch,"When you're alone, and life is making you lonely
You can always go downtown
When you've got worries, all the noise and the hurry
Seems to help, I know - downtown
Just listen to the music of the traffic in the city
Linger on the sidewalk where the neon signs are pretty
How can you lose?

The lights are much brighter there
You can forget all your troubles, forget all your cares
So go downtown; things'll be great when you're
Downtown; no finer place for sure
Downtown everything's waiting for you

Don't hang around and let your problems surround you
There are movie shows downtown
Maybe you know some little places to go to
Where they never close, downtown
Just listen to the rhythm of a gentle bossa nova
You'll be dancing with him too before the night is over
Happy again

The lights are much brighter there
You can forget all your troubles, forget all your cares
So go downtown, where all the lights are bright
Downtown - waiting for you tonight
Downtown - you're gonna be all right now

And you may find somebody kind to help and understand you
Someone who is just like you and needs a gentle hand to
Guide them along

So maybe I'll see you there
We can forget all our troubles, forget all our cares
So go downtown; things'll be great when you're
Downtown; don't wait a minute for
Downtown; everything's waiting for you

Downtown, downtown, downtown, downtown",Downtown,2000

I can't forget the one they call Joanna
We owned the summer, hand in hand Joanna
And now she's always just a tear away
Goodbye you, you long lost summer
Leaving me behind you
Revealing things for lovers that may find you
I still hang on to every word that day, you passed my way

You made the man a child again, so sweetly
He breathed your smile
Lived in your eyes completely
And on his heart there's still a trace of you

You were made to go out and get her
The minute you let her under your skin
Then you begin to make it better

Don't carry the world upon your shoulders
For well you know that it's a fool who plays it cool
By making his world a little colder

Hey Jude, don't let me down
You have found her, now go and get her

And with one pull of the trigger he would vanish overnight
Dancing by the roadside, holding on for dear life
Then a gun from out of nowhere made a widow of his wife

I don't mind, single file down the runway
Feelin' fine and I see you, my friend
Over and over again

Who can we get on the case?
We need Perry Mason
Someone to put you in place
Calling Perry Mason again
Again

Riding painted horses, oh the kids they love it so
You can see it on their faces, how they love the wind to blow
Minding my own business like my mama always said
But if I don't try to help 'em they could wind up on the front page

I don't mind, draw the line, then draw me an arrow
Feelin' fine, then I'll see you, my friend
Over and over again

Who can we get on the case?

Someone to put you in place

Just keep on talking, baby, I've been doing this all night
How much did you give me, tell me it'll be all right

Over and over again

Who can we get on the case?
