Tom Grennan,"The way you stand there in your three striped shell toes and
The way your hair dances, it's clear you want all eyes on you
It's all eyes on you
And though I know that I won't get no answers, I
I just can't stop from indulging my lean eyes on you
My fool eyes on you

As you dance on your burning clothes
I feel the bullet holes
Tell myself I've got nothing to lose
Though your touch gives me vertigo, 
I'm like a domino
Darling I keep falling back to you

But if it's over
why do you stop me getting sober on your love?
You pull me closer
You say you miss the way I hold ya
I feel you breathing on my shoulder
Why do you stop me getting sober?

You leave your sweet bitter taste under my tongue and
You leave your smoke to seep deep into my lungs
I know how you're taking hold
My love is wasted and somehow you laced it
And I'm on my knees
There's no remedy

As you dance on your burning clothes
I feel the bullet holes
Tell myself I've got nothing to lose
Though your touch gives me vertigo, 
I'm like a domino
Darling I keep falling back to you

But if it's over, 
why do you stop me getting sober on your love?
You pull me closer
You say you miss the way I hold ya
I feel you breathing on my shoulder
Why do you stop me getting sober?

Na na na, na na na
Na na na na
Na na na, na na na
Na na na na

But if it's over, 
why do you stop me getting sober on your love?
You pull me closer
You say you miss the way I hold ya
So if it's over, 
why do you stop me getting sober on your love?
You pull me closer
You say you miss the way I hold ya
I feel you breathing on my shoulder

Why do you stop me getting sober?
Why do you stop me getting sober?",Sober,
Tom Grennan,"There's something in the water, calling my name
Two beats I had no idea now the message you sent
Well it ain't clear 'cause I've fallen in love
Now I'm holding on to my past
And my mother said ""you're growing up fast"" though
Time is gone in a blink
It's time to think and put your worries aside
Today is just a day and tomorrow never dies
So, never not live another regret and take every moment you get
And let actions speak louder than words
So shout at the skies if your words cannot be heard

Well there's something in the water, calling my name
Two beats I had no idea now the message you sent
Well it ain't clear 'cause I've fallen in love
Yes I, fall I'm in love again?
With you, with you
With you, with you, now with you
Now I'm wondering why my force ain't clear
Am I hiding behind a crystal tear
And will the time stop or will the dime drop, or will my footprint make the mark?
Well I can see the light now, as I'm stepping out the door

Well there's something in the water, calling my name
Two beats, I had no idea well now the message you sent
Well it ain't clear 'cause I've fallen in love
There's something in the water
Water, water, water
Two beats I had no idea, now the message you sent
Well it ain't clear 'cause I've fallen in love
Yes I, fall I'm in love again
Now with you, with you, with you
With you now with you",Something in the Water,
Tom Grennan,"I've walked through hell, and I've battled the storms
I know too well how, it feels when you fall

I'm on this road, and I won't' lose my faith
Pack it up, pack it up, 'cause I'm on my way
For so long

I've been praying, for a brighter day
I've been praying, trying to find my way
Time moves on and seasons change
Nothing ever stays the same
Praying, I keep praying

I keep praying
I keep praying

I've over due, just a little bit of luck
I get the taste, but its never enough
I'm on this road
And I won't lose my faith
Pack it up, pack it up 'cause I'm on my way
For so long

I've been praying for a brighter day
I've been praying trying to find my way
Time moves on and seasons change
Nothing ever stays the same
Praying, I keep praying

On my own, I search high and low
Till I find what I've been looking for
I'm in my deep end and I won't be beaten 
Till I find what I've been praying for

I've been praying, for a brighter day
I've been praying, trying to find my way
Time moves on and seasons change
Nothing ever stays the same
Praying, I keep praying

I keep praying
I keep praying
'Cause time moves on and seasons change
Nothing ever stays the same
Praying, I keep praying",Praying,
Tom Grennan,"Oh I know that there's another
Be my secret lover
You've been sending the signs
Underneath the sheets, maybe we can meet
No need to turn off the light
I don't give a damn about what went down before
Oh be my secret lover, be my secret lover
Underneath the covers, na, na, na

You told me it was naughty
Tell me something that I don't know
Sneaky meetings ending with you in your bathrobe
Monday mornings, Friday night was the done thing
Pretty dirty things

Oh how could this be wrong?
We're young and we're just having fun
Tell me how could this be wrong?
Prime time thrills on my ghost watch skills

Oh I know that there's another
Be my secret lover
You've been sending the signs
Underneath the sheets, maybe we can meet
No need to turn off the light
I don't give a damn about what went down before
Oh be my secret lover, be my secret lover
Underneath the covers, na, na, na

I'm not asking any more of you so don't think
I'll be taking you to dinner with my close friends
From the start I said lets not get attached
You were offered that

Oh how could this be wrong?
We're young and we're just having fun
Tell me how could this be wrong?
Prime time thrills on my ghost watch skills

Oh I know that there's another
Be my secret lover
You've been sending the signs

Tom Grennan,"My eyes are delusional
And I'm not thinking the same
But I've been wondering
Is it me you're looking for

Well you'll find me standing on these cold streets
Hoping that you're looking for a little bit more
Will you catch me, save me when I'm falling?
Tell me have you ever been here before?

So take my hand and lead the way
Find your courage, find your lion
And take your pride and leave the past
Set sail for new horizons

So take my hand and lead the way
Find your courage, find your lion
And if you hear the angel sings
Sweet Hallelujah
Hallelujah

So many faces telling the story
Like once upon a time
Blinded by the force of falling in love or
Leaving it all behin but
The fear of the unknown, and who to follow
Leaves me howling at the skies

Is there a purpose in what we believe?
Well I will continue to wear my heart upon my sleeves

So take my hand and lead the way
Find your courage, find your lion
And take your pride and leave the past
Set sail for new horizons

So take my hand and lead the way
Find your courage, find your lion
And if you hear the angel sings
Sweet Hallelujah
Hallelujah

Hallelujah, Hallelujah
So if you hear the angel singing

Tom Grennan,"Chasing unbelief, walking into tomorrow morning
Trying to figure out why I would do this to myself
My pennies turn to nothing
My wine has turned to water
I like to say at least I've got my health
I turn another corner if my shoes had only let me
Rest my head in your arms
Settle down and get some sleep
My pennies turn to nothing
My wine has turned to water
Around the corner, Monday, said we'll grieve

I've lost and I've won
And I've done what I've done
And I've found out it's the first day of the sun
But I'll keep running, running
Now I'm young and wild and free
Yes I'll be where I want to be
Oh I'll keep running, running
Running away

Fickle friends came closer
Gathered round and did the talking
Someone flash the bill
I thought I best not intervene
I called another number
Ignored another warning
Did my usual Houdini routine

I've lost and I've won
And I've done what I've done
And I've found out it's the first day of the sun
But I'll keep running, running
Now I'm young and wild and free
Yes I'll be where I want to be
Oh I'll keep running, running
Running away

Oh I'll keep running, running
Now I'm young and wild and free
Yes I'll be where I want to be
Oh I'll keep running, running

And I've found out it's the first day of the sun",First Day of the Sun,2017
Tom Grennan,"Always fine lines between us
They say nowadays don't mean much
Cast an anchor in the sand, what we did
But my ships have sailed and I'm here to tell that
I don't mean like the others
And I

I keep searching and I can't seem to find what I'm wanting
It's changing all the time and if you noticed a different side of mine
Then I've found what I've been looking for
Found what I've been looking for
Found what I've been looking for
Found what I've been looking for

Should I wait, should I stay to see it
Arm fold 'cause I'm told, I need it
I'm not frightened to take off, step away
But my ships have sailed and I'm here to tell that
I don't mean like the others
And I

I keep searching and I can't seem to find what I'm wanting
It's changing all the time and if you noticed a different side of mine
Then I've found what I've been looking for
Found what I've been looking for
Found what I've been looking for
Found what I've been looking for

I've been running 'round, running 'round, running 'round
Now I'm done and now I'm done now and now I'm done and now
Scared the magic might fade away

Tom Grennan,"Yeah
Today is gonna be the day
That they throw it all back to you
And by now
You should have somehow realised what you have to do
The world keeps on turning round
Bridges keep burning down
Nobody can hear you now
No matter how loud you shout

Sitting in total silence
Totally lost, no guidance
You don't call no more
Nobody can find ya
Nobody can find the time like they lost their watch
They find it hard to think you went soft
I'll find an architect type, promise that I'll make sure
He puts the building blocks in place
To start rebuilding, we've been broken since children
They keep telling me that we're only human
I don't do no silly excuses
Nobody wins we're losing
So violent and abusive
It's all battle, scars and bruises
'Cause what really

The sun shines down on me, on me, on me
And breaks my ties you'll see, you'll see, you'll see
That angel's eyes, they bleed
This life, I chose
My open wounds they show that
Memory lane is like a winding road

Today was gonna be the day
But they'll never throw it back to you
By now you should've somehow
Realized what you're not to do
I don't believe that anybody
I don't believe that anybody
Feels the way I do about you now

I just want you to know that I love you
It's a cruel world outside but
I need you to know that I got you
Such a forgetful place and
I don't want them to forget you
Hard times have arrived and
I wanna make sure that we get through

I look into your eyes sometimes
All I can see is emptiness, no resemblance, no more fire
Or anything similar
When did the winter get to us, I'll go blind
Looking at a light so bright
But if I can find my way
Then I'll come back for you and I'll make it right
I wanna say something but I don't know how
I gotta keep it moving, I can't turn 'round
How did David make Goliath fall down?
What's the king if the king has lost its crown?

Today is our day
We ain't running away
But the night was so long that
Today is the day that we break off our chains?

When the sun shines down on me, on me, on me
And breaks my ties you'll see, you'll see, you'll see
That angel's eyes, they bleed, this life I chose
My open wounds they show
That memory lane is like a winding road
Like a winding road

Memory lane is like a winding road
Like a winding road
Memory lane is like a winding road",Memory Lane,2017

Won't you hold me in your arms

Tom Grounds,"Do you know what it means to miss New Orleans
And miss it each night and day
I know I'm not wrong, the feeling's getting stronger 
The longer I stay away

Miss the moss-covered vines, tall sugar pines
Where mockingbirds used to sing
I'd love to see that old lazy Mississippi
Hurrying into Spring

The moonlight on the bayou
A Creole tune that fills the air
I dream about magnolias in bloom
And I'm wishin' I was there

Do you know what it means to miss New Orleans
When that's where you left your heart
And there's one thing more, I miss the one I care for
More than I miss New Orleans",Do You Know What It Means to Miss New Orleans?,2007
Tom Grounds,"In the still of the night
As I gaze out of my window
At the moon in it's flight
My thoughts all stray, stray to you

In the still of the night
While the world lies in slumber
Oh the times without number
When I say to you

Do you love me
Just like I love you
Are you my life to be
That dream come true
Or will this dream of mine
Will it fade way out of sight

Just like that moon growing dim
Way out on the rim of the hill
In the still of the night",In the Still of the Night,2007
Tom Grounds,"Love walked right in and drove the shadows away
Love walked right in and brought my sunniest day
One magic moment and my heart seemed to know that love said hello
Though not a word was spoken

One look, and I forgot the gloom of the past
One look and I had found my future at last
One look and I had found a world completely new
When love walked in with you

Tom Gullion,"You don't know what love is
'Til you've learned the meaning of the blues
Until you've loved a love you've had  to lose,
You don't know what love  is.

You don't know how lips hurt
Until you've kissed and had to pay the cost,
Until you've flipped your heart and you have lost,
You don't know what love is.

Do you know how a lost heart fears
At the thought of reminiscing,
And how lips that taste of tears
Lose their taste for kissing?
You don't know how hearts burn
For love that can, not live yet never dies.
Until you've faced each dawn with sleepless eyes,
You don't know what love is.",You Don't Know What Love Is,2003
Tom Hambridge,"Well I'm drifting and drifting,
Like a ship out on the sea.
Well I'm drifting and drifting,
Like a ship out on the sea.
Well I ain't got nobody
In this world to care for me.

If my baby would only take me back again
If my baby would only take me back again.
Well you know I ain't good for nothin' baby

Well I haven't got no friends.  

I give you all of my money,
Tell me what more can I do.

Tom Hambridge,"Everybody wants a little piece of me these days. 
And the more I give the more they want to take. 
All the time we let slip away. 
Keeps on haunting me, 
All those sweet summer days take over every dream. 

And it's a long way home. 
It's such a long way home. 
And I feel your memory fade with every day I'm gone. 
And it's a long way home. 

Lot of bountiful lights, oh I see in your face. 
Everybody's my best friend
But there's no one to take your place. 
Every night I fall asleep to the sound of my wheels turning. 
Another town, another show. 
But no one knows the way I'm hurting. 

And it's a long way home. 
It's such a long way home. 
And I feel your memory fade with every day I'm gone. 
And it's a long way home. 

What do you do when the 'dream comes true' is a nightmare. 
When you leave them behind and there's no way to find your way back there. 
It's just not fair. It's just not fair. 

And it's a long way home. 
It's such a long way home. 

And I just gotta find my way back home baby.

It's a sign he's given me every thing will be ok

Tickets please, tickets
Well, you coming?

It’s a magic carpet on a rail
Never takes a rest
Flying through the mountains and the snow
Ride for free and join the fun
(You can ride for free)
If you just say yes!
'Cause that’s the way things happen
On the Polar Express
You bet!

Wooo wooo the whistle blows
That’s the sound of her singing
Ding ding the bell will ring
Golly look at her go!

You wonder if you’ll get there soon
Anybody’s guess
'Cause that’s the way things happen
On the Polar Express

When we get there we’ll scream “Yes!” (Yeah)
We’ll arrive with a bang bang bang
boom boom boom
Laughing all the way!

It’s a choo choo with a stunning view
That rivals all the best
But you won’t see it advertised
It’s a simple fact we stay on track
Though sometimes we digress
But that can only happen on the Polar Express

Hiss hiss the steam hisses
That’s the sound of her breathing
Clang clang the boiler bangs
What a wonderful show!

With a comfy seat and lots to eat
Boy is this the best!
Wish it wouldn’t ever have to end
With a little luck we’ll be on time
There’s no need to stress
'Cause that’s the way things happen
On the Polar Express

Lights are gleaming far across the snow
You’re not dreaming
May I present the North Pole!
If it’s penguins you expect to view
You surely haven’t guessed
They all live down at the other end

With a little luck we’ll be on time
There’s no need to stress

Don't lose your confidence if you slip,
Be grateful for a pleasant trip,
And pick yourself up,
Dust yourself off,
Start all over again.

Work like a soul inspired,
Till the battle of the day is won.
You may be sick and tired,
But you'll be a man, my son!

Who had to fall to rise again?
So take a deep breath,
Pick yourself up,
Dust yourself off,
Start all over again.",Pick Yourself Up,2007
Tom Hobson,"The time has come for us to pause 
And think of living as it was 
Into the future we must cross (must cross) 
And I'd like to go with you 
And I'd like to go with you 

You say I'm harder than a wall 
A marble shaft about to fall 
I love you dearer than them all (them all) 
So let me stay with you 
So let me stay with you 

And as we walked into the day 
Skies of blue had turned to grey 
I might have not been clear to say (to say) 
I never looked away 
I never looked away 

And though I'm feeling you inside 
My life is rolling with the tide 
I'd like to see it be an open ride 
Along with you 
Going along with you 

The time we borrowed from ourselves 
Can't stay within a vaulted well 
And living turns into a lender's well 
So let me come with you 
And let me come with you 

And when we came out into view 
And there I found myself with you 
And breathing felt like something new
Along with you 
Going along with you",Genesis,1974

And out him in a kettle of oil

Summer's here again
I've been trying to make you mine
Since I don't know when
Way your soul can let you fly
Makes me love you more
Spirit flowing into mine
What I'm living for
So don't hold back little baby
When I reach out to you
I'm doing my best to bring you 'round
Swing you into view
So I can better see your face
And you can look at mine
And we can feel each other move
Together down the line
One more time I'm asking you
Let this moment be
All our lives can intertwine
Till eternity
Please don't let your pride run free
Make the past go by
There's a place out there for us
If we only try
With what we got together now

As I take your hand and lead you to the dance floor
As the music dies, something in your eyes
Calls to mind the silver screen
And all its sad good-byes

I'm never gonna dance again
Guilty feet have got no rhythm
Though it's easy to pretend
I know you're not a fool

Should've known better than to cheat a friend
And waste the chance that I've been given
So I'm never gonna dance again
The way I danced with you

Time can never mend
The careless whispers of a good friend
To the heart and mind
Ignorance is kind
There's no comfort in the truth
Pain is all you'll find

I'm never gonna dance again

Though it's easy to pretend
I know you're not a fool

So I'm never gonna dance again
The way I danced with you

Never without your love

Tonight the music seems so loud
I wish that we could lose this crowd
Maybe it's better this way
We'd hurt each other with the things we'd want to say

We could have been so good together
We could have lived this dance forever
But no one's gonna dance with me
Please stay

Taste a morning out there

Of lovers walking in the night
They had a kind of glow around them
It almost looked like heaven's light

I knew I'd never know
That warm and loving glow
Though I might wish with all my might
No face as hideous as my face
Was ever meant for heaven's light

But suddenly an angel has smiled at me
And kissed my cheek without a trace of fright

I dare to dream that she
Might even care for me
And as I ring these bells tonight
My cold dark tower seems so bright
I swear it must be heaven's light

Procurar o desconsolo
Que cansei de conhecer

É um estepe, é um prego, é uma conta, é um conto
É um pingo pingando, é uma conta, é um ponto
É um peixe, é um gesto, é uma prata brilhando
É a luz da manhã, é o tijolo chegando
É a lenha, é o dia, é o fim da picada
É a garrafa de cana, o estilhaço na estrada
É o projeto da casa, é o corpo na cama
É o carro enguiçado, é a lama, é a lama

É um passo, é uma ponte, é um sapo, é uma rã
É um resto de mato na luz da manhã
São as águas de março fechando o verão
É a promessa de vida no teu coração

É uma cobra, é um pau, é João, é José
É um espinho na mão, é um corte no pé
São as águas de Março fechando o verão
É a promessa de vida no teu coração
É pau, é pedra, é o fim do caminho
É um resto de toco, é um pouco sozinho
É um passo, é uma ponte, é um sapo, é uma rã
É um belo horizonte, é uma febre terçã
São as águas de Março fechando o verão
É a promessa de vida no teu coração

Tom Jobim,"Eis aqui este sambinha feito numa nota só
Outras notas vão entrar, mas a base é uma só
Esta outra é consequência do que acabo de dizer
Como eu sou a consequência inevitável de você
Quanta gente existe por aí 
Que fala tanto e não diz nada
Ou quase nada

Já me utilizei de toda a escala 
E no final não sobrou nada
Não deu em nada
E voltei pra minha nota como eu volto pra você
Vou contar com a minha nota como eu gosto de você
E quem quer todas as notas 
Ré, mi, fá, sol, lá, si, dó
Fica sempre sem nenhuma
Fique numa nota só

Tom Jobim,"Um cantinho e um violão
Este amor, uma canção
Pra fazer feliz a quem se ama

Muita calma pra pensar
E ter tempo pra sonhar

Da janela vê-se o Corcovado
O Redentor que lindo

Quero a vida sempre assim com você perto de mim
Até o apagar da velha chama

E eu que era triste
Descrente deste mundo
Ao encontrar você eu conheci
O que é felicidade meu amor

O que é felicidade, o que é felicidade",Corcovado,2015
Tom Jobim,"A insensatez que você fez
Coração mais sem cuidado
Fez chorar de dor
O seu amor
Um amor tão delicado
Ah, porque você foi fraco assim
Assim tão desalmado
Ah, meu coração que nunca amou
Não merece ser amado

Vai meu coração ouve a razão
Usa só sinceridade
Quem semeia vento, diz a razão
Colhe sempre tempestade
Vai, meu coração pede perdão
Perdão apaixonado
Vai porque quem não
Pede perdão
Não é nunca perdoado",Insensatez,2015
Tom Jobim,"Cantado

É melhor ser alegre que ser triste
Alegria é a melhor coisa que existe
É assim como a luz no coração

Mas pra fazer um samba com beleza
É preciso um bocado de tristeza
É preciso um bocado de tristeza
Senão, não se faz um samba não

Falado

Senão é como amar uma mulher só linda
E daí? Uma mulher tem que ter
Qualquer coisa além de beleza
Qualquer coisa de triste
Qualquer coisa que chora
Qualquer coisa que sente saudade
Um molejo de amor machucado
Uma beleza que vem da tristeza
De se saber mulher
Feita apenas para amar
Para sofrer pelo seu amor
E pra ser só perdão

Cantado

Fazer samba não é contar piada
E quem faz samba assim não é de nada
O bom samba é uma forma de oração

Porque o samba é a tristeza que balança
E a tristeza tem sempre uma esperança
A tristeza tem sempre uma esperança
De um dia não ser mais triste não

Falado

Feito essa gente que anda por aí
Brincando com a vida
Cuidado, companheiro!
A vida é pra valer
E não se engane não, tem uma só
Duas mesmo que é bom
Ninguém vai me dizer que tem
Sem provar muito bem provado
Com certidão passada em cartório do céu
E assinado embaixo: Deus
E com firma reconhecida!
A vida não é brincadeira, amigo
A vida é arte do encontro
Embora haja tanto desencontro pela vida
Há sempre uma mulher à sua espera
Com os olhos cheios de carinho
E as mãos cheias de perdão
Ponha um pouco de amor na sua vida
Como no seu samba

Cantado

Ponha um pouco de amor numa cadência
E vai ver que ninguém no mundo vence
A beleza que tem um samba, não

Porque o samba nasceu lá na Bahia
E se hoje ele é branco na poesia
Se hoje ele é branco na poesia
Ele é negro demais no coração

That warm my heart and see my mornin' sun

Or Disneyland, and Mother Goose, no nursery rhyme

I think about her face aglow and ease my mind 
 
Sometimes I call her up at home knowin' she's busy 
And ask her if she could get away and meet me 
And maybe we could grab a bite to eat 
And she drops what she's doin' and she hurries down to meet me 
And I'm always late 
But she sits waitin' patiently and smiles when she first sees me 
'cause she's made that way 
 
And if that ain't lovin' me

WRITERS DON PITTMAN, BILL TAYLOR, THOMAS LAVERNE

Yes there are many precious mem'ries that I'd like to recall
And there are some things that I would surely like to forget
I've been up Lord I've been down and sometimes just in between
But you know something neighbors I haven't reached to my highest mountain yet
Yes I know Gods bless me time and time and time and time again
And these blessings for exceeding my deepest woe
I've had the help of loved ones and many friends who stood by me
And without their favor I would have given up a long long time ago
I remember my boyhood days back in Faraday Louisiana
The long hot summer and that cool Louisiana rain
You know sometimes I wish I could go back and relive yesterday
Oh Lord and for a while be mama's little boy again
You know folks the things that matter most in this old world money just can't buy
Sweet love precious mem'ries that will live on and on and on
And I remember Lord when I stumble sometimes fall I wonder why
Then I'll then I'll never never never walk alone
Yes these are the things that matter most to me
Precious mem'ries from your friend Jerry Lee

Tom Jones,"Right from the first day one man stood alone
And somehow he missed what didn't exist how could he have known
He looked all around him and lifted his head
For he heard a voice and rose to rejoice as somebody said

This place needs a woman's touch
To share in the plan
For without a woman's touch
Life don't mean much to a man

Up through the ages, the story's the same
A king to himself, alone with his wealth is living in vain
His castle will crumble and he'll wonder why
'Cause wealthy or poor, there's one thing for sure, he just can't deny

The need of a woman's touch
To share in the plan
For without a woman's touch
Life don't mean much to a man

I was a drifter who couldn't be tamed
So reckless and wild but lost like a child
Whose dreams never came

Then I felt the pleasures of love's happiness
One look in her eyes and I realized
I've truly been blessed

Thank God for a woman's touch
To share in the plan
For it took my woman's touch
To make me feel like a man

When I was young?
Am I hoping in vain, just to think she could change anything?

When you see the mysteries of time
Here there are those who just live in the past

And this sad little island is breaking my heart with its dark
Shades of green
And as hard as I try I just cannot see why this should be

At four grey walls that surround me

I've truly been blessed

We all have sorrow

Tom Jones,"And now the end is near
And so I face the final curtain
My friend, I'll say it clear
I'll state my case of which I'm certain

I've lived a life that's full
I've traveled each and every highway
And more, much more than this
I did it my way

Regrets, I've had a few
But then again too few to mention
I did what I had to do
And saw it through without exception

I planned each charted course
Each careful step along the byway
But more, much more than this
I did it my way

Yes, there were times, I'm sure you knew
When I bit off more than I could chew
But through it all, when there was doubt
I ate it up and spit it out
I faced it all and I stood tall
And did it my way

I've loved, I've laughed, and cried
I've had my fill; my share of losing
And now as tears subside
I find it all so amusing

To think I did all that
And, may I say, not in a shy way
No, oh, no, not me
I did it my way

For what is a man? What has he got?
If not himself, then he has naught
To say the things he truly feels
And not the words of one who kneels
The record shows I took the blows
And did it my way",My Way,1995

So the Holy Bible says
Mary's boy child, Jesus Christ
Was born on Christmas day

While shepherds watched their flocks by night
They saw a bright new shining star
And heard a choir from heaven sing
The music came from afar

Hark, now hear the angels sing
A new King born today
And man will live forever more
Because of Christmas day

Now Joseph and his wife Mary
Came to Bethlehem that night
They found no place to bear her child
Not a single room was in sight

Hark, now hear the angels sing
A new King born today
And man will live forever more

Why can't we be making love nice and easy

Take a trip somewhere far, far away

It's the honky tonk women, That gimme, gimme, gimme the honky tonk blues. I laid a divorcee in New York City, I had to put up some kind of a fight. The lady, then she covered me in roses, She blew my nose and then she blew my mind. It's the honky tonk women, That gimme, gimme, gimme the honky tonk blues.

A flower grows,
I believe that somewhere in the darkest night
A candle glows,
I believe for everyone who goes astray,
Someone will come to show the way,
I believe, I believe.

I believe above the storm a smallest prayer
Will still be heard,
I believe that someone in the great somewhere
Hears every word,
Every time I hear a newborn baby cry,
Or touch a leaf, or see the sky,
Then I know why,
I believe.

""Get six jolly cowboys to carry my coffin
Get six pretty maidens to sing me a song
Put bunches of roses all over my coffin
Put roses to deaden the sods as they fall""

""Go gather around you a group of young cowboys
And tell them the story of this my sad fate
Tell one and the other before they go further
To stop their wild roving before it's too late""

""Oh, bury me beside my knife and my shooter
My spurs on my heels, my rifle by my side
And over my coffin put a bottle of brandy
That the cowboys may drink as they carry me along""

""Go fetch me some water, a cool cup of water
To cool my parched lips,"" the poor cowboy then said
Before I returned, his spirit had left him
Had gone to his Maker--the cowboy was dead

And bitterly wept as we bore him along

He gets up real early, and he goes down town
And about fifteen minutes after he's been gone
There's a big milk truck pulls up on the lawn
And that milkman rushes up to the door
Where that man's wife is waitin' in a kimono
And she plants a big old kiss on his cheek and they go inside
And that truck never moves for an hour or two

Ice cream, or none of them other cowy things""

He's an alligator wrestler
He jumps right in there and grabs them long green boogers
By whatever you grab them long green boogers by
Well, one day he's got a full Nelson on this big alligator
When this other alligator sneaks up and bites his right ear plumb off
Didn't bat an eye, just crawled off in the shade and went to sleep
The alligator, not the man

Well, it's none of my business
One day I said, ""Well, it's sure too bad about that little accident that you had
'Cause now your hat's gonna fall down over your eyes
And you can't ever be gypsy
'Cause you don't have no place to wear a gold earring""

He come unwrapped; he just snapped; thinks he's a chicken
That's right, one of them cackling Colonel Sanders types
He roosts in the bush by the side of the house

Well, it's none of my business, but one day I said
""Have you ever thought about findin' him a doctor who could make him well""
And she said ""Well, I have now and then, but then again
He don't eat much, just chickenfeed
And all that peckin' in the ground don't hurt nothin'
Heaven knows we can use the eggs""

Stood Running Bear, young Indian brave
On the other side of the river
Stood his lovely Indian maid

Little White Dove was her name
Such a lovely sight to see
But their tribes fought with each other
So their love could never be

Running Bear loved little White Dove
With a love as big as the sky
Running Bear loved little White Dove
With a love that couldn't die

He couldn't swim the raging river
'Cause the river, it was too wide
He couldn't reach little White Dove
Waiting there on the other side

In the moonlight, he could see her
Throwing kisses 'cross the wave
Her little heart was beating faster
Waiting there for her brave

Running Bear loved little White Dove
With a love as big as the sky
Yes, Running Bear loved little White Dove
With a love that couldn't die

Running Bear dove in the water
Little White Dove, she did the same
As they swam out to each other
Through the swirling stream they came

Now their hands touched and their lips met
The swirling river, it pulled them down
Now they'll always be together
In their happy hunting ground

Running Bear loved little White Dove
With a love as big as the sky
Yes, Running Bear loved little White Dove
With a love that couldn't die

And heard a choir from heaven sing
The music came from afar

Hark, now hear the angels sing
A new King born today
And man will live forever more
Because of Christmas day

Now Joseph and his wife Mary
Came to Bethlehem that night
They found no place to bear her child
Not a single room was in sight

Hark, now hear the angels sing

Tom Jones,"[Chorus]
Jezebel
She cast a spell
After the show
If you meet her at the backdoor
She likes the boys in the band
She was a one-night-stand
But you better watch your wallet
She clean out your pockets
Jezebel

Jezebel
She's fine as hell
I met her in a pub
That's when she cast her spell
I looked in her eyes
It was time to bail
We left the club sometime after twelve
Now she got me hypnotized to the bossa nova
Trapped in the twilight hoping this spell could be over

[Chorus]

Jezebel
She's a crook
Seduces men with her looks
She'll control your mind
And then she'll rob you blind
Jezebel
She looks alive from crime
Now she still got me hypnotized to the bossa nova
Trapped in the twilight hoping this spell could be over

[Chorus: x2]

Mama, lay me down to sleep
I pray the Lord my soul to keep
But if I die before I wake
I pray the Lord my soul to take

Now I learned from my mistakes
And when I woke from the nightmare dream
I realized it's not too late
If there's anybody out there that knows a Jezebel
Watch your back or she will send your soul to hell

[Chorus: x2]

Thirty years strong never went wrong
Still in the game I decide when I'm gone
Now I'm gonna set the whole house on fire
I won't stop rocking till I retire

When I was a playboy called romeo
I met a girl she rocked my world
I swore I do whatever to get to her

I'd take a plane, I'd land in spain
I'd take a cab up to her path

I play the part
I feel so good, I feel so good
When Madison square garden no longer screams for me
And the record company don't send no limos for me
And the young girls they think that I'm too old

I know I be ok when I think of the young days, the young days
With a mike and a guitar I used to racket on any stage, any stage
From the hood to the suburbs in the theater near you
The big neon lights whenever we came through
People pushing through like they don't no what to do
Bouncers screaming he, he, he

A hunderd girls rushed that door
Ain't no what the bouncers say
They went to the club screaming tom

""A hero you'll be
If you bring me the rose of love""
So, today I must go where the wide rivers flow
Down from the hills above
From beginning to end
Who will guide me, my friend
For the difficult task that she chose?
Will the sun and the rain
From whose bosom I came
Show me the way to The Rose?
For my true love I yearn
But I'll never, ever return
Till I find where that red lady grows
When I find her, I'll sing
And the mission bells will ring

Tom Jones,"He said:

Son my name is Boregard Rippy
I come to you from Tupelo Mississippi
I write songs that'll sing like a bird
I play licks on my guitar
Like you ain't never heard

But I'm down on my luck
And things are just a little slack
I gotta quarter in my pocket
And a shirt on my back
You buy me some supper
And give me a place I can sleep

That'll rock your head to sleep
I got talent boy
Said back home they call me

Well, I knew I was in a room
With some kind of a nut
When he pulled out that pack 
Of used cigarette butts

So that's when I told him
""We can't use you today""
So I handed the boy a dollar
And sent him on his way

Well, the boss got back
And we both had a laugh
When I told him
'Bout the Tupelo Mississippi Flash
And pretty soon I had the story circling around
About this Mississippi nut
That we had in our town

I said,
Watch him everybody
The boy's squirrely
He walks around calling himself
The Tupelo Mississippi Flash

Well, it happened one day
While I was driving to my home
I just happened to have my car radio on
When I heard the jockey raving about
A brand new smash
By a kid called
The Tupelo Mississippi Flash

I almost wrecked my automobile
I went through a red light
I hit the traffic cop

Well, my story's got an ending
And it's short and sweet
The boss man he fired me
And left me out in the street
But I got a new job now
And I'm as learnin' real fast
I'm drivin' the bus
For the Tupelo Mississippi Flash

And his Cadillac
I'm driving that for him too
And that yacht he's got
And is there a plane??

And folks came running so they could hear

First he carved out young Abe Lincoln
Abe will teach 'em civil rights
Then a king named Martin Luther
So they'd recall his peaceful fight

Old Mark Twain, his wit and wisdom
Will surely show them life is fun
But he smiled with satisfaction

And he made the people laugh
When he got across the message
To walk along life's open path

Decked out with spotlights yellow and red
And then they wrote him up in all the papers

I hope your troubles are few
All my good wishes go with you tonight
I've been in love like you

Be brave, young lovers, and follow your star
Be brave and faithful and true
Cling very close to each other tonight
I've been in love like you

I know how it feels to have wings on your heels
And to fly down a street in a trance
You fly down a street on a chance that you'll meet
And you meet not really by chance

Don't cry young lovers whatever you do
Don't cry because I'm alone

It brings back the sound of music so tender,
It brings back a night of tropical splendour,
It brings back a memory evergreen.

I'm with you once more under the stars,
And down by the shore an orchestra's playing 
And even the palms seem to be swaying
When they begin the beguine.

To live it again is past all endeavour,
Except when that tune clutches my heart,
And there we are, swearing to love forever,
And promising never, never to part.

What moments divine, what rapture serene,
Till clouds came along to disperse the joys we had tasted,
And now when I hear people curse the chance that was wasted,
I know but too well what they mean;

So don't let them begin the beguine 
Let the love that was once a fire remain an ember;
Let it sleep like the dead desire I only remember 
When they begin the beguine.

Oh yes, let them begin the beguine, make them play 
Till the stars that were there before return above you,
Till you whisper to me once more,
""Darling, I love you!""

They were serving drinks as usual, and the usual crowd was there
On my left stood Big Joe McKennedy, and his eyes were bloodshot red
And he turned his face to the people, these were the very words he said

I was down to St. James infirmary, I saw my baby there
She was stretched out on a long white table, 
So sweet, cool and so fair

Let her go, let her go, God bless her
Wherever she may be
She may search this whole wide world over
Never find a sweeter man as me

When I die please bury me in my high top Stetson hat
Put a twenty dollar gold piece on my watch chain
The gang'll know I died standing pat

Let her go, let her go God bless her
Wherever she may be
She may search this wide world over
Never find a sweeter man as me

I want six crapshooters to be my pallbearers
Three pretty women to sing a song
Stick a jazz band on my hearse wagon
Raise hell as I stroll along

Yes, they'll all come to meet me, arms reaching, smiling sweetly.

At four grey walls that surround me
And I realize, yes, I was only dreaming.
For there's a guard and there's a sad old padre,
Arm in arm, we'll walk at daybreak.
Again I touch the green, green grass of home.

I think about a night
When the earth smelled of summer
And the sky was streaked with white

was sleeping on a hill

There are new lovers now
on the same silent hill
Looking on the same blue sea
And I know Tom and I
are a part of them all
And they're all a part of Tom and me

Hello Young lovers whoever you are
I hope your troubles are few
All my good wishes go with you tonight
I've been in love like you

Be brave, young lovers, and follow your star
Be brave and faithful and true
Cling very close to each other tonight
I've been in love like you

I know how it feels to have wings on your heels
And to fly down a street in a trance
You fly down a street on a chance that you'll meet
And you meet not really by chance

Don't cry young lovers whatever you do
Don't cry because I'm alone

I never would go.

Your lips red as flame,

But if I'd ever leave you,
It couldn't be in autumn.
How I'd leave in autumn
I never will know.
I've seen how you sparkle
When fall nips the air.
I know you in autumn
And I must be there.

And could I leave you
Running merrily through the snow?
Or on a wintry evening
When you catch the fire's glow?

At four grey walls that surround me

No words got in the way
The telephone clicked, ooh it was finished
And I never even saw your face

For years to slip away
And it takes more, more than memories
To make it through the day

Everyday is a brand new test for our love to survive
In a world that can be so mean
We're gonna have to fight to save our dreams
And just to keep our love alive

It takes two hearts committed
For love to turn out right
And it takes more, more baby than memories
To make it through the night

It's gonna take you touchin' me and me holding you
Every, yes, every, everyday
There's so much good baby, so much good we could do
if we don't, if we don't let harsh words get in the way

Every minute, every hour as the years go by
I'm gonna try with all my might
But you know that it takes more, more than memories
To make it through the night

Oh, it takes more, oh more than memories
To make it through the night
It takes more, so much more baby than memories
To make our love turn out right

There's nothing I want, nothing that you need say
Just let me lie down for a while and I'll be on my way

I was no more than a kid when you put me on the Southern Queen
With the police on my back I fled to New Orleans
I fought in the dockyards and with the money I made
I knew the fight was my home and blood was my trade

Baton Rouge, Poncitoula, and Lafayette town
Well they paid me their money Ma I knocked the men down
I did what I did well it come easily
Restraint and mercy Ma were always strangers to me

I fought champion Jack Thompson in a field full of mud
Rain poured through the tent to the canvas and mixed with our blood
In the twelfth I slipped my tongue over my broken jaw
I stood over him and pounded his bloody body into the floor
Well the bell rang and rang and still I kept on
Till I felt my glove leather slip 'tween his skin and bone

Then the women and the money came fast and the days I lost track
The women red, the money green, but the numbers were black
I fought for the men in their silk suits to lay down their bets
I took my good share Ma, I have no regrets

Then I took the fix at the state armory with big John McDowell
From high in the rafters I watched myself fall
As he raised his arm my stomach twisted and the sky it went black
I stuffed my bag with their good money and I never looked back

Understand, in the end Ma every man plays the game
If you know me one different then speak out his name
Ma if my voice now you don't recognize
Then just open the door and look into your dark eyes
I ask of you nothing, not a kiss not a smile,
Just open the door and let me lie down for a while

Now the gray rain's falling and my ring fightin's done
So in the work fields and alleys I take all who'll come
If you're a better man than me then just step to the line
Now there's nothing I want Ma nothing that you need say
Just let me lie down for a while and I'll be on my way

So rebellious a lover

Tom Juravich,"It was early springtime when the strike was on,
They drove us miners out of doors,
Out from the houses that the Company owned,
We moved into tents up at old Ludlow. 

I was worried bad about my children,
Soldiers guarding the railroad bridge,
Every once in a while a bullet would fly,
Kick up gravel under my feet. 

We were so afraid you would kill our children,
We dug us a cave that was seven foot deep,
Carried our young ones and pregnant women
Down inside the cave to sleep. 

That very night your soldiers waited,
Until all us miners were asleep,
You snuck around our little tent town,
Soaked our tents with your kerosene. 

You struck a match and in the blaze that started,
You pulled the triggers of your gatling guns,
I made a run for the children but the fire wall stopped me.
Thirteen children died from your guns. 

I carried my blanket to a wire fence corner,
Watched the fire till the blaze died down,
I helped some people drag their belongings,
While your bullets killed us all around. 

I never will forget the look on the faces
Of the men and women that awful day,
When we stood around to preach their funerals,
And lay the corpses of the dead away.

We told the Colorado Governor to call the President,
Tell him to call off his National Guard,
But the National Guard belonged to the Governor,
So he didn't try so very hard. 

Our women from Trinidad they hauled some potatoes,
Up to Walsenburg in a little cart,
They sold their potatoes and brought some guns back,
And they put a gun in every hand. 

The state soldiers jumped us in a wire fence corners,
They did not know we had these guns,
And the Red-neck Miners mowed down these troopers,
You should have seen those poor boys run. 

We took some cement and walled that cave up,
Where you killed these thirteen children inside,
I said, ""God bless the Mine Workers' Union,""
And then I hung my head and cried.

Jumped out of bed and I ran outside feeling so extra ex-satisfied

It's the best day ever
(Best day ever)
It's the best day ever
(Best day ever)

I'm so busy got nothing to do
Spent the last two hours just tying my shoe
Every flower, every grain of sand is reaching out to shake my hand

It's the best day ever
(Best day ever)
It's the best day ever
(Best day ever)

Sometimes the little things start closing in on me
When I'm feeling down I wanna lose that frown
I stick my head out the window and look around

Those clouds don't scare me they can't disguise
This magic that's happening right before my eyes

Soon Mr. Moon will be shining bright
So the best day ever will last all night
Yes the best day ever's gonna last all night now

It's the best day ever
(Best day ever)
It's the best day ever

It's the best day ever

Been a-blowing his top in the blue

Somewhere along the Rio Grande
Sadly I'm reminiscing, madly again I'm kissing
Someone along the Rio Grande
 
It happened in Monterey, a long time ago
I met her in Monterey, in old Mexico
Stars and steel guitars
And luscious lips, as red as wine
Broke somebody's heart
And I'm afraid that it was mine
It happened in Monterey
Without thinking twice
I left her and threw away the key to paradise
My indiscreet heart, longs for the sweetheart 
That I left in old Monterey
 
Making believe I'm merry
In ev'ry glass of sherry
I see the sparkle of her eye
And when I hear the cello
Tender and sweet and mellow
I hear the music of her sigh

No first of spring
No song to sing
In fact here's just another ordinary day
No April rain
No flowers bloom
No wedding Saturday within the month of June

But come ye back when summer's in the meadow,
Or when the valley's hushed and white with snow,
It's I'll be here in sunshine or in shadow,
Oh, Danny boy, oh Danny boy, I love you so!

But when ye come, and all the flowers are dying,
If I am dead, as dead I well may be,
You'll come and find the place where I am lying,
And kneel and say an Ave there for me.
And I shall hear, though soft you tread above me,
And all my grave will warmer, sweeter be,
For you will bend and tell me that you love me,
And I shall sleep in peace until you come to me!",Danny Boy,1995

But I did not hear what you said
You wanted me, you wanted my name
I was carrying two feet of lead

See the rising sun on this make-believe town
White shoe shine and leather, both of us so brown
I was in the water, you were dry
Yelled my name and I know I

I'm still learning how to crawl
I, I'm just learning how to crawl

And if the big drum, that drum is rumbling
Keep me in line, keep me from stumbling
When I first went down, everything was right
Skinny white leg laying on my bed

Over there running, afraid to be found out
Tasting everything with a scream and shout
All I wanted I rejected
Drinking from a cup of [Incomprehensible]

I'm still learning how to crawl
I, I'm still learning how to crawl

Hear you comin' in 'til you lay the table
Hear you comin' in, ohh, not comin' to watch me fall
The killer moves in, moves right into your face
When everything seems to be in its right place

Can't wait for love, love to be king
Can't wait for the love to come with its sting
You blew away in your blue dress
I lost the one that I loved the best

I, I'm still learning how to crawl
I, I'm still learning how to crawl
I, I'm just learning how to crawl

Tom Lehrer,"I should like to consider the folk song, and expound briefly on a theory I have held for some time, to the effect that the reason most folk songs are so atrocious is that they were written by the people. If professional songwriters had written them instead, things might have turned out considerably differently. For example, consider the old favorite, with which, I'm sure, you're all familiar, Clementine, you know:

In a cavern, in a canyon,
Dadada dadadada... *

...a song with no recognizable merit whatsoever - and imagine what might have happened if, for example, Cole Porter had tried writing this song. The first verse might have come out like this:

In a cavern, in a canyon,
Excava-ha-ha-hating for a mine,
Far away from the boom-boom-boom of the city
She was so pretty - what a pity, Clementine.

Oh Clementine, can't you tell from the howls of me
This love of mine calls to you from the bowels of me.
Are you discerning the returning
Of this churning, burning, yearning for you...oo oo...ah ah...

... well, supposing at this point that Mozart (or one of that crowd) had tried writing a verse, the next one might have come out as a baritone aria from an Italian opera, somewhat along these lines:

Era legera e come un fairy
E suo shoes numero nine,
Herring bo-ho-ho-hoxes sans-a to-ho-ho-hopses,
Sandalae per Clementina si, per Clementina si,
Per Clementina sandalae, per Clementina sandalae, per Clementina.

Clementina, Clementina, Clementina...
Herring boxes sans-a topses sandalae per Clementina,
Herring boxes sans-a topses sandalae per Clementina,
Che sciagura** Clementina, che sciagura Clementina, cara Clementina, cara 
Clementina-na-na-na-na-na-na-na!

Supposing at this rather dramatic juncture in the narrative, one of our modern cool school of composers had tried writing a verse, the next one might have come out like this:

A one, a two, a three...
Drove those ducklings to the water... yeah brach! doddley doo doo uh ah!
Ev'ry morning like 9am...ooh pah! de do de do do do, biddley da!
Got hung up on a splinter, got a-hung up on a splinter...
Cloo ge mop! Huh huh! [do de do de do do do]
Fell into the foamy brine, dig that crazy Clementine, man!

To end on a happy note, one can always count on Gilbert and Sullivan for a rousing finale, full of words and music and signifying - nothing.***

That I missed her depressed her young sister named Esther,
This mister to pester she tried.
Now her pestering sister's a festering blister,
You're best to resist her, say I.

The mister resisted, the sister persisted,
I kissed her, all loyalty slipped.
When she said I could have her, her sister's cadaver
Must surely have turned in its crypt.
Yes, yes, yes, yes!

But I love she and she loves me.
Enraptured are the both of we.
Yes I love she and she loves I
And will through all eterni-tae!

She loves is anti-social, alcoholic, physically repulsive, or just plain unsanitary, nevertheless she is his because he is hers, or something like that. but as far as I know there has never been
Pular song from the analogous male point of view, that is to say, of a man who finds himself in love with, or in this case married to, a girl who has nothing whatsoever to recommend her. I have
Pted to fill this need. the song is called she's my girl.

Sharks gotta swim, and bats gotta fly,
I gotta love one woman till I die.
To ed or dick or bob
She may be just a slob,
But to me, well,
She's my girl.

In winter the bedroom is one large ice cube,
And she squeezes the toothpaste from the middle of the tube.
Her hairs in the sink
Have driven me to drink,
But she's my girl, she's my girl, she's my girl,
And I love her.

The girl that I lament for,
The girl my money's spent for,
The girl my back is bent for,
The girl I owe the rent for,
The girl I gave up lent for
Is the girl that heaven meant for me.

So though for breakfast she makes coffee that tastes like shampoo,
I come home for dinner and get peanut butter stew,
Or if I'm in luck,
It's broiled hockey puck,
But, oh well, what the hell,
She's my girl,
And I love her.

Tom Lehrer,"Time was when an American about to go abroad would be warned by his friends or the guidebooks not to drink the water. But times have changed, and now a foreigner coming to this country might be offered the following advice:

If you visit American city,
You will find it very pretty.
Just two things of which you must beware:
Don't drink the water and don't breathe the air!

Pollution, pollution!
They got smog and sewage and mud.
Turn on your tap
And get hot and cold running crud!

See the halibuts and the sturgeons
Being wiped out by detergeons.
Fish gotta swim and birds gotta fly,
But they don't last long if they try.

Pollution, pollution!
You can use the latest toothpaste,
And then rinse your mouth
With industrial waste.

Just go out for a breath of air
And you'll be ready for Medicare.
The city streets are really quite a thrill -
If the hoods don't get you, the monoxide will.

Pollution, pollution!
Wear a gas mask and a veil.
Then you can breathe,
Long as you don't inhale!

Lots of things there that you can drink,
But stay away from the kitchen sink!
The breakfast garbage that you throw into the Bay
They drink at lunch in San Jose.*

So go to the city,
See the crazy people there.
Like lambs to the slaughter,
They're drinking the water
And breathing [cough] the air!",Pollution,1965
Tom Lehrer,"One very familiar type of song is the christmas carol. although it is perhaps a bit out of season at this time. however, I'm informed by my ""disk jockey"" friends - of whom I have none,
In order to get a song popular by christmas time, you have to start plugging it well in advance. so here goes. it has always seemed to me after all. that christmas, with it's spirit of giving, o
Us all a wonderful opportunity each year to reflect on what we all most sincerely and deeply believe in.

I refer of course, to money. and yet none of the christmas carols that you hear on the radio or in the street, even attempt to capture the true spirit of christmas as we celebrate it in the unit
Ates. that is to say the commercial spirit. so I should like to offer the following christmas carol for next year, as being perhaps a bit more appropriate.

Christmas time is here, by golly,
Disapproval would be folly,
Deck the halls with hunks of holly,
Fill the cup and don't say ""when.""
Kill the turkeys, ducks and chickens,
Mix the punch, drag out the dickens,
Even though the prospect sickens,
Brother, here we go again.

On christmas day you can't get sore,
Your fellow man you must adore,
There's time to rob him all the more
The other three hundred and sixty-four.

Relations, sparing no expense'll
Send some useless old utensil,
Or a matching pen and pencil.
""just the thing I need! how nice!""
It doesn't matter how sincere it
Is, nor how heartfelt the spirit,
Sentiment will not endear it,
What's important is the price.

Hark the herald tribune sings,
Advertising wondrous things.
God rest ye merry, merchants,
May you make the yuletide pay.
Angels we have heard on high
Tell us to go out and buy!

So let the raucous sleigh bells jingle,
Hail our dear old friend kris kringle,
Driving his reindeer across the sky.
Don't stand underneath when they fly by.
Actually I did rather well myself, this last christmas. the nicest present I received was a gift certificate ""good at any hospital for a lobotomy"". rather thoughtful.

She was a hermit in her world
Her story was much like mine
She could be my valentine

And although we've never met
I won't forget her yet

Our history is just in our blood
And history like love is never enough
And I recognize so much of you
In these eyes always so blue
Why always so blue

And soon enough soon enough
This will all be a memory
And soon enough soon enough
This will fade like a photograph

Those things that I've lost and things that I've sold
This case is now closed the trail has gone cold
And your sticks all are snakes I throw them aside

This is not enough this is not enough for me

This endless and fake parade
I'm goinna torch my name and my trade

Run into the bright lights
Run into the bright lights

Brother don't go back to funeral row
The streets have fallen silent
And the cross no longer glows
On funeral row
And I'm tired of this dark place
Where hope dies and hope fades
I'm gonna leave these shadows behind

Feed the flames and feed the fire

Cut your losses cut your ties

And outside the cars
Throw light on the walls and the scars

Put the world in a box.

Turn the sign to the street.

Aim for where horizon and blue skies, meet


But all I know is

I'm not ready yet

For the light to dim

Got a suitcase, got regrets

But I'm hopeful yet


I've been a gifted thief

Stole everything for the cause

I never had fingers as light as yours


So wake up pretty girl

See the hope in small things

Disappointment can wear you thin


But all I know is

I'm not ready yet

For the light to dim

Got a suitcase, got regrets

But I'm hopeful yet

And I'll raise this glass of wine

And I'll say your name


So let's be killers babe

Make the great escape

From all the bitter words

Of every crowded street and empty heart

It's Christmas day, Brooklyn in the rain

But I am safe inside a better world of hope and memory

Drunk on velvet wine, southern cross for light

Deal your cards and hope that I can play a better hand this time

And the still the sound, still the sound of the city tonight
Keeps my dreams and my demons alive
Baby I?m still alive

I hear the city breathe
I dream the city?s dreams
And she?s still in my arms
For another year

So bring your broken hearts
Call me The King of Cards
I?ll make it disappear
With a sleight of hand

And I watch you fall from a great height
And you watch me fail night after night
And the still the sound, still the sound of the city tonight
Keeps my dreams and my demons alive
Baby I?m still alive

Still you don?t come, you won?t come
But the fever has broken
And the daylight is blinding your eyes
And still you don?t come, you won?t come
But the city she?s not done
She?s calling, she?s calling your name
",Sound of the City,2007
Tom Mega,"Dans le port d’Amsterdam
Y a des marins qui chantent
Les rêves qui les hantent
Au large d’Amsterdam
Dans le port d’Amsterdam
Y a des marins qui dorment
Comme des oriflammes
Le long des berges mornes
Dans le port d’Amsterdam
Y a des marins qui meurent
Pleins de bière et de drames
Aux premières lueurs
Mais dans le port d’Amsterdam
Y a des marins qui naissent
Dans la chaleur épaisse
Des langueurs océanes

Dans le port d’Amsterdam
Y a des marins qui mangent
Sur des nappes trop blanches
Des poissons ruisselants
Ils vous montrent des dents
A croquer la fortune
A décroiser la lune
A bouffer des haubans
Et ça sent la morue
Jusque dans le cœur des frites
Que leurs grosses mains invitent
A revenir en plus
Puis se lèvent en riant
Dans un bruit de tempête
Referment leur braguette
Et sortent en rotant

Dans le port d’Amsterdam
Y a des marins qui dansent
En se frottant la panse
Sur la panse des femmes
Et ils tournent et ils dansent
Comme des soleils crachés
Dans le son déchiré
D’un accordéon rance
Ils se tordent le cou
Pour mieux s’entendre rire
Jusqu’à ce que tout à coup
L’accordéon expire
Alors le geste grave
Alors le regard fier
Ils ramènent leur batave
Jusqu’en pleine lumière

Dans le port d’Amsterdam
Y a des marins qui boivent
Et qui boivent et reboivent
Et qui reboivent encore
Ils boivent à la santé
Des putains d’Amsterdam
De Hambourg ou d’ailleurs
Enfin ils boivent aux dames
Qui leur donnent leur joli corps
Qui leur donnent leur vertu
Pour une pièce en or
Et quand ils ont bien bu
Se plantent le nez au ciel
Se mouchent dans les étoiles
Et ils pissent comme je pleure
Sur les femmes infidèles
Dans le port d’Amsterdam
Dans le port d’Amsterdam.",Amsterdam,1992
Tom Mega,"C'est trop facile d'entrer aux églises
De déverser toutes sa saleté
Face au curé qui dans la lumière grise
Ferme les yeux pour mieux nous pardonner

Tais-toi donc Grand Jacques
Que connais-tu du bon Dieu?
Un cantique une image
Tu n'en connais rien de mieux

C'est trop facile quand les guerres sont finies
D'aller gueuler que c'était la dernière
Amis bourgeois vous me faites envie
Vous ne voyez donc point vos cimetières

Tais-toi donc Grand Jacques
Laisse-les donc crier
Laisse-les pleurer de joie
Toi qui ne fus même pas soldat

C'est trop facile quand un amour se meurt
Qu'il craque en deux parce qu'on l'a trop plié
D'aller pleurer comme les hommes pleurent
Comme si l'amour durait l'éternité

Tais-toi donc Grand Jacques
Que connais-tu de l'amour?
Des yeux bleus des cheveux fous
Tu n'en connais rien du tout

Et dis-toi donc Grand Jacques 
Dis-le-toi bien souvent
C’est trop facile
C’est trop facile
De faire semblant

Et dis-toi donc Grand Jacques 
Dis-le-toi bien souvent
C’est trop facile
C’est trop facile
De faire semblant",Grand Jacques (C'Est Trop Facile),1992
