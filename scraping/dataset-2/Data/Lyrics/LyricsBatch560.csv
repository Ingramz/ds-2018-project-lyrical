Kool & the Gang,"Oh, I want a special love in my life, that trust in me
We sendin’ this one out to all those lovers
Who have someone who can trust
The special love in your love, yeah

Oh, this thing called love is easy to say
Not so hard to do, many games that we play
Just like Monopoly, ooh, you rolled the dice
Probably [Incomprehensible] chance
Chance you take, pray it's right

Like your best friend, oh, the confidante
Want a special love to love you like your mama
I found a special love, special love in you
And I want you to believe in me like I believe in you

Trust me like I trust in you, yeah
And I wanna spend my life with you, baby
Girl, I got trust in you, yeah

Even when I’m away from home
Just trust me, if you call, I’m gon' find my way to you
Ain’t nothin’ but the best of me for my girl
Even through those hard times, our love comes shinin’ through

I played my share of games before I met you
That time has passed away, but we’re just someone new
[Incomprehensible] in no one else when things ain’t goin’ right
Without you by my side, I just can’t sleep at night

Oh, trust me like I trust in you, yeah
And I wanna spend my life with you, baby
Girl, I got trust in you, yeah, oh, yeah, yeah

Every time I think of you leaving me
I get so shook up to drive me on my edge
And if you put your trust in me, I won’t let you down
I bet you got that, our destiny is you and I

Let the record show, not wrecks to flow
You might catch me anywhere, private jet, you go
You already know I got another show
Then after the show I’m back home to you
Back home to you, back home to you, you feel me?

Trust me, I'll be waitin' on you
‘Coz you complete the things that I do
Even when you come, I'm by side
Don't worry 'bout nothin', I'll be alright
I'll be waitin' on you, all you have to do is just trust me

Trust me just like I trust in you, yeah
I wanna spend my life with you, baby
Just like I trust in you, girl

Trust in me, baby, keep on lovin’ me
Trust in me, like I believe in you
Trust in me, baby
I don’t wanna live without you, how do I?
Just trust me

And you want to let someone know that you really appreciate them?
All you have to do is moan a little bit for me
It goes something like this
Ooooh, ooooho, oooooh, oooooho

You see, no time for wasting, baby
We're gone all through those moves
I'm offering satisfaction, darling
Girl, I'm giving you all my love

Oooooh, ooooho

Out of the sky for you
Stop the rain from falling
If you asked me to
I'd do anything for you
Your wish is my command
I could move a mountain when
Your hand is in my hand
Words cannot express
How much you mean to me
There must be some other way
To make you see
If it takes my heart and soul
You know I'd pay the price
Everything that I possess
I'd gladly sacrifice

Oh you to me are everything
The sweetest song
That I could sing
Oh baby, oh baby

I'm just a clown
Who picks you up
Each time you're down
Oh baby, oh baby

Build my hopes upon

To keep me holding on
So now you got

Come on and
Take the rest of me
Oh baby

Though you're close to me
We seem so far apart
Maybe given time
You'll have a change of heart
If it takes forever boy then
I'm prepared to wait
The day you give your love to me
Won't be a day too late

Oh you to me are everything

Kool & the Gang,"[Erick Sermon]
Relax your mind, let your conscience be free
And get down to the sounds of EPMD
Well you should keep quiet while the MC rap
But if you tired, then go take a nap!
Or stay awake and watch the show I take
Because right now, I'm bout to shake'n'bake
The E-R-I-C-K is my name, I spell
Thanks to the clientele, yo I rock well
I'm not an MC who talking all that junk
About who can beat who, sounding like a punk
I just get down and I go for mine
Say 'check one-two', and run down the line

[Parrish Smith]
To the average MC I'm known as The Terminator
Funky beat maker, new jack exterminator
Destroy an employ', when your rhymes are not void
Never sweating your girl (Why P?) Cause she's a skeezoid
When I'm on the scene I always rock the spot
I grab the steel with the crown on top
In the beginning, I like to let my rhymes flow
And at twelve I press cruise control
Sit back and relax, let my rhymes tax
Maintain MC's while the Double E macks
Always calm under pressure, no need to act ill
Listen when I tell you boy, you gots to chill

(""Jungle boogie!"")

[Erick Sermon]
I be the personal computer information on rap
Like the B-I-Z Markie says, I'll make your toes tap
I format the rhymes, step by step
Make em sound def to maintain my rep
Prepared to come off, in case of a diss
Not worried about a thing, cause we can do this
I can turn the party out just by standing still
Make the ladies scream and shout while the brothers act ill
Take total control, of your body and soul
Pack a nine in my pants for when it's time to roll

[Parrish Smith]
I'm the P, double-E, M-D-E-E
And one thing I hate, is a biting MC
When I enter the party suckers always form a line
Then they ease their way up, and try to bite my lines
I did thousands of shows, dissed many faces
And deal with new jacks, on a one-to-one basis
But every now and then a sucker MC gets courageous
And like an epidemic it becomes contagious
But never the least they all R.I.P
For all those unaware it means Rest In Peace
Cause M.D. stands for Microphone Doctor
And the capital P (capital P) capital M (capital M)
Capital D-E-E's no doubt the chief rocker
Don't like to get ill, but if I have to I kill
So believe me boy, you got's to chill

(""Jungle boogie!"")

[Erick Sermon]
Catch every word I'm saying, no there's no delaying
Don't hesitate to motivate the crowd I'm not playing
Seeing is believing, you catch my drift?
Don't try to a-dapt because I'm just too swift
(How swift?) I'm so swift and that's an actual fact
I'm like Zorro, I mark a E on your back
I don't swing on no ropes or no iron cords
The only weapon is my rapping sword

[Parrish Smith]
Intimidate MC's with the tone of my vocal drone
When I'm pushing on the microphone
Cause I'm the funky rhyme maker, MC undertaker
The one who likes to max and relax
And when it's time, issue diggum-smack
I keep their hands clapping, fingers snapping, feet tapping
When it's time to roll Uzi patrol was packing
The PMD, the mic's my only friend
And through the course of the party, I kill again and again
So if you're thinking bout battling you better come prepared
Come with ya shield and your armor geared
You gots to chill",You Gots to Chill,2014
Kool A.D.,"I've had the same phone number for a decade
And various phone models strapped next to my left leg
My first power-up was a flip phone
And I could feel the power moving up through my hip bone
Yeah, I got a lady and I dance with her
I'm happy to see her, but what she feels is my transmitter
My antenna span's killin'
I'm all full of data like a spiderman villain
I'm part flesh and part energy
The last text I sent you was from the heart literally
Taking flights it gets really really deep
I put myself on airplane mode and go to sleep
Between my cell phone, router, computer and solar radiation
My body's full of information

Yeah (I have the power)
My body's full of information!

And I don't need a lawyer
Every time I make a call I get a centimeter taller
Yeah, I'm the skies like the white guy
Motherfuck your spotify, my mind is an ipod
Both of my feets is ipads really
And this hand here's an ipad mini
And this other hand is an old wired magazine
When I pass gas it sounds like a fax machine
I be thinking of secret shit then deleting it
My mind's on the internet, if I speak it I'm tweeting it
A lawsuit, some people want to start one
But I got super powers so I'm like no harm done
I'm a thousand feet tall, I don't need no litigation
My body's full of information

Yeah
My body's full of information!

What's a computer, man? I don't even know what that is
I don't even watch tv, what's catfish?
Don't know much about science book, never read the atlas
My raps run laps around tracks like pistorius
Wonder how he finna do the new harlem shake at the wake
Two-eighths figure skate on the lake
If I fake I'mma jake, if I lie I'mma die
I clean up and look fly in a tie
If you're lost, I'mma find you
Time after time I am the slime, dime after dime
Jukebox money dance, dumbbob funnypants
Run god, dunny got a gun in the underpants
Hit the red grass, do the thunder dance
Take a peek under that, run tell shunder that
Somebody run me down the basic premise of thundercats
It seems somehow relevant to the conversation

And then my friends is
Slappin' niggas with glass chins

And, don't forget it, bitch
Yo' whole life changed the day you met me
Now you think you need a bank account
Baby, I can't see
You managin' this money, it's too much
All you do is look good
And then you fuck
Git my money, git yo' money
It's all the same
The shit ain't even funny when you talk about this game
They call me Too $hort, baby
I'm still in it
Ain't no camouflage, nuttin' but this real pimpin', bitch

Pimpin' ain't no illusion
And pimpin' ain't never died
Mo' pimps was on that heroin
And yo' pimp tripped out on that fry
The dikes done came through
And straight threw off all the game;

They could manage they own change
Pimpin' ain't no illusion

About four or five years ago I made a promise to my momma
I would neva sell no mo dope and tha world so cold
Where tha real die young and the hate grow old
But they all die slow, I wonder how it get so close

And its hard to focus when ya got bout four, five hoes
'Bout six, seven pounds of tha dro, Faybo unleashed a roll at tha do'
Tha game old, speakin' of tha game, no smoke
I always keep four four, they don't know tha life I know

From tha dro smoke, new po smoke, maybe no smoke
Whether it's my folks or your folks, never go broke
Betta owe six with tha smoke they owe me
And my mind and my heart and my soul

Check out now Mook-be, y'all know me grabbed tha mike since '93
Hatin' ass niggas wouldn't let me eat but I kept it real
Stayed true to tha streets, stayed down, sucked up tha frown
'cause I knew tha game was gonna bounce back around

Still in it till tha mothafuckin' finish, you can best believe

We made a pact when I was grindin', you was broke man
I'm sellin' weight and gettin' money in tha fat lane
We can pop that gat, we can pop that steel
We can pull that twelve front gauge

When you had blond hair hoops it is and actin' bitch made
My track got hot, my weight was up, bottom matchin' at clay court
Five deep, I'm getting no sleep and constantly mashin' on tha hoes
It's D4L, mack a therma real feel pimpin'

Gripping on wood grain
Keep on, keep on, keep on moving
Banging, swerving lane to lane

Gripping on grain, while the fifteen's bang
Know you wonder if it's thunder, where the fuck is the rain
Lane to lane dripping blue, puffing on coo-coo
Candy wetter than do, banging nothing but Screw
Reclined on buck, like I'm stuck in the mud
Ripping my mug cause I'm thug, sipping straight out the jug
Ghetto thoed we ghetto known, wih mo' ice on my heart
Boy got mo' ice, than a W march
Bout to knock my trunk off, with this shit down South
Knocking pictures off your wall, when I pass by your house
Know your spouse is your trojan, if you love her than get her
'Cause she stuck on a G, like a god damn sweater
Hotter than a baretta, trying to give it up fast
Left her stupid like cupid, and put a plug in her ass
Swanging glass moving fast, as I dash through your hood
Picking splinters out my palm mayn, gripping on wood

Hear them niggaz bumping, but they can't forget
Swanging down bumping tip, champagne under the tent
Trend setter, red beam for plexing
Crawling, living the life of a Texan
Get down your block three in the morning, waking the hood up
Crawling purple passion, up in my cup
I-10 to seventy one, mash the gas to Austin
Chrome glossing, big bossing flossing
Block to block spot to spot, no need for tripping
Still collecting my ends, in the 2K dimension
Twist a leaf out the leaf, as I crawl through the street
Waiting on the sunrise, praying a G on deep
It's a Sunday a fun day, and I crawl down Sunnydale
Sparkling sun rays, making the game prevail
Jazzy broads whispering, boppers shaking they tail
You can do what you do, I'm all about my mail

[Chorus: Repeat 2X]

Lights, camera, action it's on
Bang out my garage, and I'm on 20 inch chrome
Grab my phone, cause I'm calling Al-D
When they see the buttons, don't try to compare me
She gon stare G, so you better get her
I'm coming down, and I'm banging the hardest pit of the litter
Down south, keep our name out your mouth
And we'll get it on, and we known to buy a house
And buy the block it don't stop, with shoes and socks
Bet the top drop, and let the bumper unlock
But me I'm rolling foreign, never ever alone
Swanging left and right, with alarm cats knowing
Paints I be pouring, and you know I'm so wet
Getting me a ticket from the laws, you want to bet
They can't stand me, pulling off they say you dripping too much candy
Yes I can't stand it, I'm the drank and drip bandit
You can't handle it, bought the ice that sunk the Titanic
Don't panic, when you see me riding with Janet
On the escapade, riding a Escalade
Break these boys off with techs, my chest plate

Kool G Rap,"Listen closely, so your attention's undivided
Many in the past have tried to do what I did
Just the way I came off, man I'm gonna come off
Stronger and longer, even with the drum off
I keep on goin' and flowin' just like a river
I got a whole lot to give so I'm-a give a
Little at a time, new trails are blazin'
Action is in effect, and always stays in
Yeah, just like a shot from a cannon
I am the man in charge and I've been plannin'
A jam strong enough that it can life your soul
I'm the originator, and my rhymes are made of gold
Once you hear the capital ""a"" rap, it'll stay
With you for awhile, it won't go away
Unless you force it, because it stays with you, my friend
And if you toss it away, I'm-a hit ya again
I project my voice so it's right in the crowd
There's a sign at the door: no bitin' allowed
And if you didn't read it I suggest you do so
Or you'll be stranded, just like caruso
Sleep if ya want to, go 'head, get some shut-eye
A man broke his jaw tryin' to say what I
Say on the microphone, you shoulda left it alone
Just for the record, let it be known
That my ego's only partially grown
And never will I ever condone biting in any form, yo I'm only warm
That verse was the calm, now here's the storm
Next up (yo, I believe that's me)
Craig g, light up the mic for the symphony

This jam is dedicated to all un-optimistics
That though I wasn't coming out with some exquisite rhymes
But that's alright, 'cause now I'm back
To kill all the rumors and straighten the facts of me
Not rockin' rhymes like I always used to
But you jumped on hte tip when you heard me and the juice crew
You said, ""mmm mmm mmm, ain't that somethin?
Yo craig, I head you in that jam, and it's pumpin'
I apologize, oh yeah, and uh, can I have your autograph for me and my grandma?""
That's how I'm livin': all surprise mode
Don't even sleep, try not to keep your eyes closed
'cause if you do, when you awaken, your so-called spot will be taken
I'll take you over like a greedy executive, 'cause on the mic my prospective is
To be the best in all rap events, and since I have a call, I call experience
Next up(yo, I believe that's me)
Cool g rap, light up the mic for the symphony

Yo, marley gives the slice, I get nice
And my voice is twice as horrifying as Vincent Price
Goes deep, till you fell in a spell of a sleep
And while I'm countin' the money, you count sheep
When g rap strikes the mic, I recite the type of hype that you like
And make the people unite
I grip up hips and zip up lips, step on reps, you flip and want to sip on my tip
Take a deep breath, because you don't have another left
Comin' back like I'm avengin' my brother's deat
Makin' veterans run for medicine
'cause I put out more lights in a fight than con edison
Rip the damn cage like I'm on a rampage
And if you want rage, I'm-a make front page
Read the headlines, suckers, today's the deadline
Your head is way past bedtime
Can't kill though, solo, 'cause you're still all soft like a pillow
My rap is rougher than brillo
So fear me, don't dare dare me
And don't compare me to him when you hear me
Talk about a battle but you ain't yet ready for war
Your metaphor sucks more than a whore
You can't replace me, ice me or ace me, bass me, face me, slice me or race me
Bite me or taste me I'll show you that I got force
My rap burns your mouth like hot sauce
Run for water while I break your tape recorder
Server-to-sucker: the order is manslaughter
Another rapper, g rap wrecks, he's rated x, to mean the boy is sex, next
The amplifier gets used and abused, pumps so loud, we might blow a fuse
This is anger, madness, ready to hang 'er
Rapper or singer I'm puttin' up my middle finger
Next up (i believe that's me)
Big daddy kane, get on the mic for the symphony

Settin' it off, lettin' it off, beginnin'
Rough to the endin', you never been in
To move the groove with the smooth rap lord
Like a bottle of juice, rhymes are being poured
Down your ear, crisp and clear
As I prepare to wear, tear and smear then I'm outta here
With a mark left that you can all cling
'cause rockin' a party? yo, it's a small thing
I rip many places on regular basis, and broken down mics were the only traces
That I'd been there and there at the party
The mic had my prints, and on it was a body
So take caution, I'm not horsin' around in a throwdown, clown
I'm takin' yours son
So just acknowledge the way that I kick it
'cause if rap was a house, you'd be evicted
And dismissed from the microphone, chokin' on a bone, 'cause daddy's home
And battlin' me is hazardous to health
So put a quarter in your ass, 'cause ya played yourself
Like a game in the arcade, you need a far aid
I'm walkin' the path that allah made
I'll attend and then begin to send a speech to reach and teach
So just say when
So I can let lyrics blast like a bullet
My mouth is the gun on suckers I pull it
The trigger, ya figure, my pockets gettin' bigger
'cause when it comes to money, yo, grant's my nigga!
You've got the groove, mcs, freeze, stand still, nobody move
It's a sabotage, as I take charge, don't barge, 'cause gotdamn, I'm livin' large
Like a giant, you're nothin' but a midget, a small digit
You ain't hit it, forget it, quit it
I reign superior, always takin' care o'ya
No-frill rappers, you will evaporate, disintegrate, deflate to your fate
As the great will dominate straight to the state
Of reignin', gainin, so put kane in, that category, period, end of story",The Symphony,1988

With cuts he concocts and the party rocks 
DJ's want to Xerox it out the box 
A professional performer, wheels of steel trainer

Powerful sound waves where ear drums are torn

Fascinating results, a defeat will be difficult

And like an owl, you'll know who to 

Feed your greed, you want and need 
The rhymes that you carefully read, but your eyes bleed

And if you bite, you'll be leaving all your teeth for the Tooth Fairy 
 
Go ahead and dare me, if you think I'm joking or playing 
When you're feeling what I'm saying, you'll be kneeling and praying

Kool G Rap,"Deadly rhymes, here's the solution
Smoking so bad, I'mma cause a pollution
With satisfaction, bad assassin, fatal attraction
Drop you to an improper fraction
Ill insanity, kill like Amity-
Ville horror, as I wipe out humanity
Won't leave a path, a track, a trail to trace
But when you're staring inside a mirror, you see my face
And I'll terrify, so don't ever try
To shake or bake or flake cause I never fry
Letters together sly as a fox clever than ever
Silly ducks write rhymes with feathers
Really no needles are needed to inject this
Dope cause I'm a death wish, not even Bob Hope's
Rhymes are rugged, soul flooded, cold blooded
You ain't better, you're butter, so just shut it
Here to perform, having a brainstorm, make a rain form
Hot rap groups run to keep the name warm
Putting heads to beddy-bye like Freddy so get ready
Cause I'mma get crazier than Crazy Eddie
I'm alone but my tone is a sharp tune
Developing pictures in your brain like a darkroom
Rappers are captured and tortured with rapture
In 3-D is a G coming at you
Words in my rap will surprise you like Cracker Jacks
You dig them like Sugar Smacks and bite them like Apple Jacks
Brother, sister, misses or mister
My style is complicated, patterns like a twister
FOES, my shadow grows when I walk slow
Nerds are scared to be heard so they talk low
But I've been urging to drill in your brain like a surgeon
Rhymes so dope and they're busting you up like a virgin
More competitors change to challenger
You need to talk into a mic with a silencer
My defeat is like a mission impossible
My brain is unexplained, not illogical
Therefore I'm passing bait to assassinate
Busting your ass so fast, it'll fascinate
You try to duplicate to get up to date
Can't wait to be my pen pal or paper mate
The innovator with greater data, deeper than a crater
Of course, Polo's the boss of the crossfader
The rage is on, my rhymes are airborne
Stage is torn to wreck, my murdering gear's on
Moving a head, never bled inside a bloodshed
Nothing is said, instead heads are dead
G Rap manages styles, taking all the advantages
Putting sucker rappers in bandages
I got a plot so hot it'll tan
I might be cool but I'm far from a fan
Letting you know how it is in show biz
Give me a quiz and I'mma a show you a G wiz
Bright as Einstein, brighter than sunshine
Rhymes will intoxicate like moonshine
Total disaster the broadcaster master
Passed ya as the tempo goes faster
Sparks shoot out from the mic when I rhyme ignites
All types of words I write, put in flight
Rappers evaporate to vapor
I drop science on paper and then build a skyscraper
When I die, scientists will preserve my brain
Donate it to science to answer the unexplained
But as long as I inhale and exhale
I challenge the next female or the next male
What you hear in your ears all appears to be clear
Consider me fair cause I share ideas
That sticks to the mix, more tricks than a 666
So you better grab a crucifix

Men at work

My ideas overload
And the records I make explode in every zip code
Definitely def, the five fingers of death
Doc the Butcher, Polo's the chef
And I'm the waiter cause I serve imitators
Who try to duplicate like an emulator
Try to get paid copying a name brand
If I was Gucci, then you would be Dapper Dan
Now hear the diaper, cause I'm a sniper
You want to get hyper?
Prepare for hyperspace and just flow with the bass
And fall in place, just keep up the pace no time to waste
Just enter the place to see the entertainer
My rhymes keep me fresh like a container
Some rappers said, my rap is dead
Shake your head to my bass like a basehead
There'll be bloodshed in the meat shop
Those who beef get sliced into pork chops
Until your fork stops stabbing my rhymes
From the latest and the greatest of all times
Sleep while you knock Z's, I'mma clock G's
Freeze rap heroes below zero degrees
Rhymes like these will seize enemies
That want to be G, like the Bee Gees
Not rated PG, we break necks
Like sex, rated XXX
Yes, Doc Da Butcher is who I recommend
DJ Polo let the record spin

Construction put on paper
Listen cause I'm building a skyscraper
For a strong foundation of wheels of steel
Not a reel to reel, but the real deal
Polo works the crossfader, he's a bricklayer
And the record player turns like the Himalaya
Doc the Butcher supplies the cement
And the rhymes that I invent is the blueprint
While I'm using my mind to make a design
Polo puts up the Men at Work sign
Yeah, we still building, making a skeleton
One of the sucker MC's just fell again
So take caution if you want to know the truth
I'mma elevate you up to the roof
Listen to the sound, don't dare look down
Cause you're far from the ground
Now you're impressed cause words I manifest
Takes you more higher than cess or Buddha bless
Hard as concrete, the building's complete

Back again 
What? 
This is poison so be alert and cautious 

Those who act courageous you will get nauseous 
Infected or contaminated 
Turn on your stereo never come radio activated 
Deadly and fatal poison the title 

My recital hits the parts that are vital 
So tune in the tone of beats and poems 
Polo's headphones becomes a skull and crossbones 
Pull out your Q tips clean out the earwax 

If you're still hard of hearing, I'mma scrub them with Ajax 
With maximum drum so behave and remember 
You're a slave to my sound wave 
Faster rhymes I mastermind I have to find 

A new method time after time 
Write a rhyme quick when I pull out my Bic pen 
Stick to an idea, the soundproof slick then 
Put it on paper cause I make you hyper 

Than any other rapper cause I keep my rapping riper 
Like cherries or some say berries 
Mandatory for the auditory and its glory 
Here's the story: rappers getting leery to hear me 

G speaks in a new technique of fury 
Domination of drums and noise and 
Yo yo yo Polo yo this is poison 

Poison! [Repeat: x3] 
Look-alikes on the mic you should get off 
You're a rip-off, I'mma rip up, get rid of, cause you bit off 
Bite off ate off imitate off 
They get paid off for G Rap to get laid off 
Get up and sit up the butterer and buttercup 
Male or female shut them up, Po shut her up 
 
Yeah hide my line as you pick them up 
Rob me blind of my rhymes you might as well have said stick them up 
Letters of metaphor matters to better the fatter your pocket 
Rhymes blast off like rockets 

Rhymes will be replaced and beats erased 
In case a rapper tries to trace hardcore bass 
Made in a minute the sky is the limit 
For reaching the goal and the dream wouldn't you want to be in it to win it? 

Biters are wanted like animals hunted 
Soon as I get them I hit them I done it to the suckers who fronted 
The rappers who made it and did it 
Forget about winning the battle cause I'mma shake rattle and roll 

A little something for girls and boys and 
Yo yo Polo my man yo this is poison 

A mind designed to find a rhyme that's right on time 
One step beyond and not behind the line 
That separates dogs from divine 
Take it as a caution, or a warning sign 

Whether antonyms, words I'm blending them 
Homonyms, synonyms, good like M&M's 
With Polo and while he's slicing 
I'll turn the mike's last name into Tyson 

My brain is like a factory constantly creating 
Material stitch by stitch for decoration 
Lyrics are fabrics, beat is the lining 
My passion in rhyming is fashion designing 

Now it gets odd it, cause people want to sport it 
You bought it, if you didn't then you couldn't afford it 
Poetry full of surprises, it's like a game show 
And my brain glows just like a rainbow 

Rappers and poets they already know it 
G Rap is a terror not a error and never will I stop reaching for better 
Whether wheels of steel or reel to reel 
G Rap will make you feel the real deal 

I usually rap hardcore and I know 
That why'all thinking am I somehow semi, so 
We yell ""party"" and girls and boys and

Kool G Rap,"Here I am, R-A-W 
A terrorist, here to bring trouble to 
Phoney emcees, I move on and seize 
I just conquer, and stomp another rapper with ease 
'Cause I'm at my apex and others are below 
Nothing but a milliliter, I'm a kilo 
Second to none, making emcees run 
So don't try to step to me, 'cause I ain't the one 
I relieve rappers just like Tylenol 
And they know it, so I don't see why you all 
Try to front, perpetrating a stunt 
When you know that I'll smoke you up like a blunt 
I'm genuine like Gucci, raw like sushi 
The Sage of Rage is what rap did to me 
To make me want to create chaos and mayhem 
Cold rock a party, until the A.M. 
I'll make a muscle, grab the mic and hustle 
While you stand dazed and amazed, I'll bust a little rhyme 
With authority, superiority 
And captivate the whole crowd's majority 
The rhymes I use definitely amuse 
Better than Dynasty or Hill Street Blues 
I'm sure to score, endure for more without a flaw 
'Cause I get raw

I give a speech like a reverend, rappers start severin' 
And in my lifetime, believe I've never been beaten 
Or eaten, or just tooken out 
You know, come to think about, I keep emcees lookin' out 
And real nervous, when I'm at your service 
So give me that title boy, you don't deserve this 
I work like a slave to become a master 
And when I say a rhyme, you know that it has to 
Be perfectly fitted, 'cause I'm committed 
The entertainer and trainer and Kane'll get with it 
I go and flow and grow to let you know, I'll damage ya 
I'm not an amateur but a professional unquestionable, without a doubt superb 
So full of action, my name should be a verb 
My voice will float, on every note 
When I clear my throat, that's all she wrote 
The minute that the Kane starts to go on 
Believe it's gonna be smooth sailing, so on 
As I put other rappers out of their misery 
Get em in a battle and make them all history 
Rulin' and schoolin', emcees that I'm duelin' 
Watch em all take a fall, as I sit back coolin' 
On a throne, with a bronze microphone 
Uhm, God bless the child that can hold his own 
'Cause I get raw!  

Twenty-four-sev' chillin', killin' like a villain 
The meaning of RAW is Ready And Willing 
To do whatever is clever, take a loss never 
And the rhymes I bust, comin' off is a must 
And I come off hard with rhymes that are odd 
I rip the microphone and leave it scarred 
Never smokin' or hittin' or takin' a sniff 
Only crushin' emcees that be tryin' to riff 
I get strong and titanic, do work like a mechanic 
Make emcees panic, they all get frantic 
And skeptic, like a girl on a contraceptive 
As I rocked, but hey, what you expected? 
I'll get raw for ya, just like a warrior 
Rather like a samurai, and I'll be damn if I 
Ever let a Fisher-Price emcee hang 
Their rhymes are toy, nothing but ying yang 
So if we battle on the microphone 
Bring your own casket and tombstone 
And I'ma preach your funeral, tell me who in the world 
Could ever come with more, I get raw!",Raw [#],1989

Cause under x-ray they are Parkay
And artificial down to their initial
In no position to be official
In hip-hop not the surface or the median
I'm at the top you're a clown and a comedian
A big waste of wax plus tax
Your royalties couldn't buy a can of Ajax
Not energetic rhymes are pathetic
My beat is so sweet you'll become a diabetic
Fascinating revolving and rotating
That's how the record starts motivating

Vocally discharging lyrics like magic
Poetical recital is vital and tragic
Strikes are fatal on the mic I label
Me Kool G Rap and Polo on the table
Violators and intruders
I'll exile barbarian style like an executor
Then muta-late later
Copycatters I batter, G Rap impersonators
Brains scatter my rhyme is the solution
Record rotation forms a revolution
The spin extends another plate blends and
It corresponds to the message I've sent
Even destroy boys with a safety pen

Then I'll diminish, cities I conquer

Kool G Rap,"Love is pain left out in the rain
With nothing to gain but teardrop stains
Being haunted by a memory as I think back
The things we used to do and how we used to act
With love and trust, passion and plussed
Because a pride never kept things inside yo they was always discussed
Between us, never argued about
And I never gave a clue for you to figure it out
How I miss being blessed with your sweet finesse
As we kiss and twist and caress on the mattress
Sweet body heat, your heartbeat
I'll grip your hips and both of our lips will meet so neat
Staring up at the moonlight with someone to hold tight
Given a chance for romance until the sunlight
Brightens the sky, it reflects in your eye
But now, the reflection is gone and I cry out

She loves me, she loves me not

Looking at your picture as it sits on the table
As I put on my cable I wish that I was able
To touch but it's a shame that you had to go
So I watch the hands on the clock go real slow
Gone with the wind, is love a sin?
If it is then God, then bring it back again
Not a girl that you rate as a fine blind date
I need a love mate so I can create
So I open a window to feel the wind blow
Try to figure out how can a love end so
Fast and just pass and not even last
First grow like grass, then shatter like glass
Now I stare at the walls, clock five Tylenols
Unplug the telephone to avoid phone calls
As I sit and crave for the love she gave
But when I wake up, I'm the same love slave
Saying

She loves me, she loves me not
Yo she loves me

When you lost a good friend, dreams seem to end
Cause broken hearts and men don't blend
So I'm not here to stick every chick I can pick
You move too quick, you become seasick
And a one-night stand is for the one-track mind man
The kind of guy you kick like a can
So I race in space and try to replace the pretty face
But it's a waste, this chase is a kiddy case
Now I whisper how much I missed her
My lips should have blistered the way I kissed her
So soft and slow, laid back and relaxed
And when I move, the groove is as smooth as a sax
She kissed me low and then proceeded up
Bedsheets heated up, the pace is speeded up
Slowly but surely we reach our destiny
She got the best of me and left the rest of me
Now all I got is total confusion
She disappeared and it's not an illusion
My life is bitter, the memories glitter
I feel like dirt, so please do not litter
My heart's deflated, doctors can't rate it
I don't know how the hell I made it
So farewell sweetheart wherever you are
I'll just look at a star, and say yo

Kool G Rap,"I run rappers like races, cut them like razors
Burn them like lasers, and stun them like phasers
Cause my brain thinks and it blanks your memory banks
Sharp as shanks and poetry is like a cleat hanks
Give me a pen, a typa-writer then
I'll cut your whole posse into gingerbread men
With diction sparked from friction
Plenty of dope like the pope cause it's a G Rap prediction
Tower going outer space, louder bass
Replaces the weak rap race
Ashes to ashes, flashes of smashes and crashes
Another big man bashes
Fright, it's a silent night but it's a violent fight
My talent might explode like dynamite
Lyrics blast out, all evil will cast out
Fast and at last all rappers passed out
Wax the vocal tracks all out like whistles
Clear like crystals, loud like pistols
Here to get it straight for the '89 era
This is a killer G
In a trilogy of terror

Uh
Yeah

Lightning and thunder, rappers going six feet under
Kool G Rap makes you wonder
No blunders or mistakes, this takes hard concentration
Effort, for the method, meditation
Visions of light, collisons, tight decisions
Suckers'll end like divisions
Listen I'm like a seed from a demon, a blessing from an angel
Way more mysterious than Bermuda's Triangle
Riddle fit to hit, put together bit by bit
Like a do-it-yourself kit
Then I'll hold your soul on a remote control
So-called MC's will freeze so cold
Then get viewed and examined in a test tube
If you're a square, you freeze into an ice cube
Talent switches, words to riches
You get stitches, rhymes are wicked like witches

Freeze like cocaine, or you get a smoke brain

Kool G Rap,"This one definitely goes out on a censorship tip
So everybody sit back, relax and have a champagne sip
We gonna teach these people out there who are
Against saying what we want to say the right way
Y'know what I'm saying, so what we're gonna do
Is kick back, swing a little funky beat by my man
DJ Pete Rock, prducer extrodinaire, yo Pete Rock
Make it clear

I can flex, bend, lend a pen to a friend
Keep a party pimping from now to then
I don't have to swear, curse or juggle
Lyrics in the verse to make a party bubble
So mister Censorship, tell me, what's your problem
There's girlies on the corner, and phifey can't solve 'em
How did she say it, I'm curious G
DOes she say honey love me, or baby baby, funny
Anyway, we say what we wanna say
Play how we wanna play, feels good that way
So G Rap, huh, it's time to kick a verse
Do your man a favor and don't curse

You're telling me don't curse on a verse, they did it worse
First I put a curse on every verse
I kind of got outrageous
Check it, even made a record on how I'm doing on the B-I-T-C-Hes
Drop some verses for the bust
Every word that you heard is cause I didn't give a f-, aw shucks
Hey yo, I almost forgot
The curse is a plot but it's getting kinda hot
So I'ma let profanity retire, hey
But if worse comes to worse, I'll cut you out like Richard Pryor
So Grand Puba, kick a verse
But do your man a favor and don't curse

Don't curse bust it
I won't curse, I'll take a famous curse word and just say kcuf
Kcuf flipped around the other way means ha
Boy when I do, I see, I can't get stuck
Jump on the mic then I earn a quick buck
Buck meaning loot, then I grab some boots
And set wit my troops
For those who can't follow and got stuck
Kcuf flipped the other way means ahem, hem hem
It's just a curse, I freaked a nurse in a hearse
But I made sure I had my hat first
CL Smooth, it's time to kick a verse
God cypher the rhyme, you can't curse

Go ahead ask me, when I kick a curse in a verse, I say nope
Grab you by your hand, wash you're mouth out wit soap
Thinking to be the last one wit the bad lingo
Scooping on the skinz in the church from your bingo
Sounds of the Mecca, dark fresh from the tailor
Because they made a movie when he cuss like a sailor
Better yet, dialect dirty like a subway
Freaking for your loot, here to make it go the other way
In a vocabulary scrimage
But cursing in my village ain't good for my image
So Big Daddy, you know it's time to kick a verse
But do your man a favor, don't curse

Uhn, the smooth rap inventor that enter
Parental discretion's not advised so there's no need to censor
Kiss on, peep it, but you want to beep it, what
I feel like slapping a sticker on ya (chill chill, see) but
Too magical rhymes are too tragical
For any source to stop Kane from getting capital
If I thought sticking me was dissing me
Man, don't you know that this would be worse than Stephen King's Misery
So clean all profanity, stealing all the man to be
Rocking any microphone you're handing me
So Heavy D, i'm about to disperse
So kick another verse and don't forget not to curse

God Bless but I can't mess around wit the curses
So I'm a kick verses or a verse
Soul brother #1 here to kick facts
Smoke the microphone and produce crazy tracks
Your my bad bro, let's start the flow
I'm a kick rhymes till it's time for me to go
I can't curse cause Heavy D said so
Now I'm a get back to the subject
Get wreck, if you think I'm bluffing, just check
Wit the crew, Pete Rock and CL Smooth very down to earth
And we didn't have to curse

Yea, yea the Abstract poet Q-tip of a Tribe Called Quest
Here to wreck, y'knowhatI'msayin
Got my man Pete Rock and my man Heavy D in the house
And we're definitley chilling on the lifted tip
So bust the spit out, aha

Flim flam flim, lick my big black stuff
Plus I kick a curse to be rough enuff
You can put the sticker where the sun don't shine
So back off and let me get mine
Visions in my head when it's dealing wit hits
If I had 4 girls then I lick 8 its
Wait, don't wanna hear no drama
Cause the bum didaly Heav is a fav of my mama's
So i blew out get mad lifted
Don't have to say up the show that I'm gifted
God bless me 'cause I reach my 21st
Heavy D, don't drop a curse

Peace, peace, peace to the preacher
I'm talking about a verse without a curse that's how I reach ya
I can rock a party without a swear or a harsh verb
Backwards, no curse words, Heavy D prefers
So swing, swing to the Soul bequiem rhythm
Before I say goodbye, let me tell ya how I hit 'em
CL, Pete Rock, G Rap, Maxwell
Big Daddy, Q-Tip and ah me as well
Time to say peace, thank Pete for the beats

Notice how clean that we kept every verse
But if worst came to worst (We all say a curse)

I got a chance to get some money so I'm takin' it 
No joke because this bein' broke shit just ain't makin' it 
Cause I grew up in the fast line 
See my pops ran the numbers and my moms held the blackjack games 
Now I'm able to leave the cradle 
I don't remember the dinners, only the kilos on my kitchen table 
Sittin' right beside a pistol 
And I'm watchin' my pops, pick up bricks made out of crystal 
While he was countin' the green 
I seen nothin' but strainers, containers, scales and rocks on a triple beam 
People was too afraid to stick him up 
Because he had the most notorious brothers to come and pick him up 
When I reached ten years old 
I never recalled seein' any more money and drugs in the household 
'Cause now pops was on his feet 
And to keep us from gettin' hurt he kept his dirt in the street 
And if he tried to attack, your family's wearin' black 
Because he just got your death, put on a contract

Just put the G's on the bed, and then go head and take a freeze 
And while you're numbin' your tongue with the yum yum 
I pull out a gun, cause I want every last crumb 
I put a slug in your face 
Then I waits to start packin' the trap back in the suitcase

Kool G Rap,"I got a job with the mob, makin G's
Doin some pickups, deliveries and transportin keys
Yeah they got me like a flunkie
I'm ridin around with ten kilos inside my trunk G
And I'm holdin the suitcase
With a half a million dollars right in my motherfuckin face
And I'm tryin to ignore it
But sometimes I get tempted to make a motherfuckin run for it
The thought alone makes me shiver, damn
What if I get caught? They'll find me floatin in the Hudson river
But if I escape, I'll be in shape for my life
But they might, get my kid and my wife
See I'm supposed to make a stop
To an Uptown spot, run up the block and make another drop
But I got somethin else in mind
Cause I'm sick of puttin my motherfuckin ass on the line
I got the money and the hit
Went through the Brook nonstop cause I ain't droppin off shit
Then I thought of a plan
So I droves to my house and got my girl and my little man
C'mon bitch, pack the shit, get ready
""God damn why your face all sweaty?""
Just hurry up and get the shit
I'm a dead man bitch, understand, we gotta split
I switched the locks on the door
Started packin like I was goin on a motherfuckin world tour
Grabbed my bags and my gun
C'mon we gotta go... I'm on the motherfuckin run

Now I'm drivin and I'm lookin at my passport
I'm outta here soon as my ass hit the airport
I loaded up the automatic
I don't believe this shit, I'm stuck in motherfuckin traffic
I'm gettin nervous as a fuck see
A Lincoln Continental pullin right up beside me
Puts down my bitch and then I bent low
*gunfire, breaking glass* Bullets are flying through my window
The enemy is on attack
Drew the nine and cocked the hammer and I fired at the bitches back
I gotta take my respect
My bullets hittin italian motherfuckers in the neck
Looked at my bitch a bullet struck her
Put in another clip, cause I ain't givin up a motherfucker
Niggaz runnin up in trenches
Sprayin at my car, only missin me by fuckin inches
Stepped on the gas pedal, how bad my bitch is harmed?
Shit they only hit her in the fuckin arm
Now I'm drivin off sidewalks, makin sharp turns
My son is catchin motherfuckin heartburns
I got the car shakin wildly
I made a turn, and then I dipped my shit into a dark alley
They drove right past, now all this chasin shit is done
I'm on the motherfuckin run

The next thing I know, it was daylight
And I been sleepin in this motherfucker all night
I started pullin on my hoe
""c'mon man what?"" Wake up bitch, we gotta go!
Pulled out the alley, then I dipped
Looked down and picked up the nine and put more rounds in the clip
You know I'm headin South no doubt
And I don't give a fuck where, as long it's a hideout
Finally we crossed the border, I pulled into a station
To fill up the tank, and get a drink of water
Pullin over to park my ride
That's when I noticed this limousine comin up on my left side
Then the sucker started rammin me
Then I looked, it was the Luciano family
Looked at my bitch she started cryin, my finger on the trigger
I pulled it -- bullets started flyin
Now I'm hittin all them bastards
I'm droppin em fast, splashin blood out niggaz asses
Then I'm finally done and
I took em all out, but I caught one in the stomach
Now I'm lookin for survivors
So I ran up on the side of the car, and hit the driver
And then I laid low
The only motherfucker left was Don Luciano
So I snuck up the sucker
Put my gun to his head, ""Whassup now motherfucker?""
He said, ""Wait, I want to talk""
I put his brains on the sidewalk
Another life I had to waste
He fell on his back, and then I spit right in his guinea face
He saw the barrel of the devil's gun

Kool G Rap,"Back in the days was kinda crazy, kid.  I started out with nothin'.
Wasn't livin' like Thanksgiving; I was turkey without the stuffin'.
Sometimes I sweared to God that I was headed for the poorhouse.
Say mama caught the drama; she would bleed tryin' to feed four mouths.
Wasn't rockin' Girbauds; I barely had clothes, and when it snowed,
And temperatures droppin' below zero, you know I froze.
No CD's, a black and white TV, a seat is a rubber tire.
With a hanger for the antenna, turned channels with some pliers.
Had nothin' in my cabinet, but cans of Raid.
I'm knockin' on my neighbor's door,
To borrow a cup of sugar for my Kool-Aid.
I wasn't freshly dipped, my gear was straight ripped; I'm trippin',
'Cause my winter coat got lost buttons,
And zippers that wouldn't stay zipped.
I never remembered Jack, the brother was straight fat cat.
Not even a Big Mac black, I had Kid Castle topped with crackerjacks.
Walkin' the streets, with the weak sneaks on my feet,
And the freaks wouldn't speak, I never had lipstick on my cheek.
So much for gettin' humped from the stunts, I always struck out.
The one y'all likes is takin' hikes, if you can't pull a buck out.
So now I gots to dedicate my next plate to all the homeboys and girls,
Straight up baby, I'm blowin' up in the world.
Blowin' up, blowin' up in the world!

It seems like only yesterday, my moms was on my back:
""Get your butt up out the sack, and find a job, or hit the road, Jack."" 
Black, I don't disown her, I'm just a kid from Corona.
With a G.E.D. diploma, with more ribs showin' than Tony Rhoma's.
In order to get straight, I gotsta to make a muscle;
Learned to hustle and bustle, and I gave the streets a tussle.
Standin' down on the corner, slangin' fat rocks to bottles.
With the black tops, for cops got my shorty watchin' my back, Hobbes.
Makin' mad lucci, bought up Louis Vuitton, Gucci.
Hoochies callin' me boochi, while they smooch me, givin' up the coochie.
Now I'm a felon, started sellin', and splittin' melons.
I started gellin', to tellin' police, just 'cause I was swellin'
Hangin' out on the corner, playin' cee-lo, rollin' for half a kilo.
Yo, you'll never see G-low a-goin' below.
Yeah, straight gettin' fortunate, as long as fees was torchin' it.
It started gettin' hot around the block, the cops was scorchin' it.
But luckily I made out before the coppers could frisk me, and diss me,
'Cause business in drugs is gettin' too risky.
So now I just lamp, collect stamps, snatch up tramps' diamonds and pearls.
Straight up, baby, I'm blowin' up in the world.
Blowin' up, blowin' up in the world!
Blowin' up, blowin' up in the world!

Blowin' up, blowin' up in the world! 
I'm blowin' up the world, I gotta get mines, I gotta get mines.
I gotsta get mines, yeah
I got put on by DJ Polo, cut the record, ""It's a Demo,""
And started chillin' in limos with champagne and tinted windows.
Hoppin', no time for pages, sportin' gold chains and rings.
Clockin' money and fame, nothin' changed, I'm still the same.
Just spendin' twenties and tens at women pullin' on my linen,
And grinnin' 'cause I was winnin' in this game, from the beginning.
The lyrical skills was kinda ill, gave you a slight chill.
So I just let the hype build, known for rappers run and go write wills.
I turned from a hobo to a solo, bozin' for dolos.
Stole my dough, you still below, now I perfer cigars and blow Mo'.
So catch a flashback, of a G. Rap track, attacked, like a headcrack.
That's smack, through your cap, with the lead black,
And here's a new cut, for pooh-butt, rappers hangin' from off my
Two nuts, like they was put there by members of the Ku Klux. 
So peep Kool G. Rap, don't sleep, money unless it's witcha girl.

Fiendin' to make his dreams come true but see money was caught mean 
Started runnin' wild and livin' life type of foul that was my shorty's style 
But deep down in heart he was still only a child 

He was typin' nice at ball if he had height y'all 
Might of been 'NBA Today' instead I watched his life fall 
Blowin' up the spots and poppin' them tec glocks 
Collectin' street props, splittin' tops, didn't stop, so many men dropped 

Started committin' murder after murder 
Blasted the last nigga that tried to riff so fast he flipped him like a burger 
Slipped and became the victim of his own murder hunger 
He got put six feet under by a small shorty that was younger 

And this type of street violence today happens too often 
It hit me hard as hell to see my dog up in the coffin 
People droppin' a rose when the casket is closed 
Hey yo, that's the name of the game out on the street, that's how it goes 

They say: ""Live by the trigger, die by the trigger"" 
It ain't about whose gun is more bigger, nigga 
It's bout whose draw is quicker 
So to my shorty dog puzzled I'm pledgin' 

Died at the age of 17, Brooklyn East New York legend 
(Tap the bottom of the bottle for the brothers) 
Keep it real on the street, money, and look out for one another 
 
Thinkin' back when I was chillin' with K-Von, but now he's long gone 
So I carried on and wrote this song to keep the strong on 
Me and black-o way back in childhood when we was wild hoods 
Runnin around the neighborhood and up to no good 

Started hangin' hard out there on the boulevard in stolen cars 
Then put behind bars sellin' drugs and pullin' yards 
Then my crimey got locked up for cookin' the rock up 
Started bouncin' uptown to stuck up, my nigga straight blew the block up 

Yeah, the blue and whites was on sight runnin' with flashlights 
On the double a fast life, that's when he seen his last nights 
Out on the street runnin' from the heat 
Then got locked up from (Happy New Year!) 

All the way down to (New Year's Eve!) 
The two of those in a wardrobe of clothes 
Got back on crackin', I let him whip the macks and go lookin' for hoes 
And then another sad story is headed for me 

When i found out another soldier died in the territory 
So in memory of my dog I write a lyric 
Straight hopin' melodies travel from my mind to your spirit 
Hear it when I get biz for K-Von, I'm pledgin' 

Died on 104 Northern Boulevard, Corona, Queens legend

Bodies covered in white sheets are layin' in the streets 
Shit gets deep as we creep up the block by the kids slangin' rocks 
And holdin' glocks stolen from the cops to get props 

You gotta split a top on the regular 
Or get plugged in your mug, from a slug, by your competitor 
Gunshots echo throughout the city like thunder, no wonder 
Another brother six feet under 

You know it ain't no jokin' when the streetlights are broken 
So keep your eyes open, or get ready for a, smokin' 'loc 
Step out of line, I hope you got your nine gun son 
The Smith and Wess', you better press 9-1-1 (word up) 

Or make a run for it there's too many to tackle 
The Big Apple will put your ass on ice like a Snapple 
So even though I rap I gots to stay strapped 
Niggas act up I back up (PI-YAH) 

I bust a cap inside your fuckin' hat 
Don't even pose with them hoes, the swinger that you chose 
Just might be down with the foes, only the shadow knows 
And ain't no lollipop, lollipop over here only the shottie pops 

(BOOM) Now just sit back and watch the bodies drop 
The younger gunmen got the bigger niggaz runnin' 
The shorties (what) the shorties (what) the shorties are comin' 
To push a nigga wig back, and leave his ass flat on his back 

The motherfuckin' ghetto knows, and it's like that

Six to the body and fo' to the head 
Followed the red bitch in the bed full of lead 
A drug-related case and now the place is filled with Feds 

Ramshacked the shack, disclose 'bout two kilos of dope 
Two ounces of coke's caught in the pocket of his coat 
So, another brother caught the ultimate surprise 
With blown out brains, to drop stains on his eyes 

Dazed as I sit back and watch the channel two news 
Watchin' his family goin' through all the boo-hoos 
You lose, like an Ill Street, the Blues are gettin' deeper 
Nothin' left in the room except for him, the Grim Reaper 

Police are takin' [unknown] snapshots, scoop up some blood drops 
Pull out a file on a juvenile child of mugshots 
The cops knew he fell victim to laws on the street 
So they just, pull out the white sheets, to cover up the dead meat 

Seal off the area with yellow tape, draw the white 
chalk around the body now the party has to motivate 
One more outlaw, was murdered on the scene for the green 
Died at the age of seventeen 

[Chorus]

Strollin' the concrete, packin' my heat, walkin' the backstreets 
I seen niggaz pull up, peepin' me out the side a black Jeep 
Six feet deep, that's where I'm goin' if I'm slippin' 
Steady cockin' my shit cause I already got the clip in 

Now who's the first nigga to run up, here they come up 
The block hardrocks with glocks rollin' holdin' they guns up 
I buck, I buck, and then I struck one in the chest 
Nigga should of wore a vest but now his ass is put to rest 

But now I got three mo' niggaz, pullin triggers 
Strays are ricochetin' off the bricks, zigga zigga 
But who got the biggest strap? Who's bustin' bigger caps? 
My BOOM BOOM BOOMS against they PAP PAP PAPS 

No haps, G. Rap ain't goin' out like a sucker 
I reloaded the shot and dropped another motherfucker 
Quick, I duck and shit to dodge the bullets comin' at me 
'Cause I won't be too happy with a slug inside my nappy 

Two more niggaz left, they scared to death, but I'm leary 
Shit gets kinda scary when I got bulletholes near me 
I went between two cars, lettin' off the quarter pound 
I see another body fallin' down to the ground 

Quick I run up on him cause I don't think that he's dead 
Standin' over his ass I put two more inside his head 
That's three niggaz down, only got one nigga to go 
I gots to send his ass to the gravedigger so 

I lay low in the cut and wait for moneygrip to slip up 
Nearly shot my whole clip up, I got one more slug to rip up 
Look over by the GS, see his ass stickin his head out 
Boom, let the lead out, blew a piece of his brain dead out 
The back of his head, now he's dead, because he fell face down 

Right on the motherfuckin' streets that he dwelled

Yeah to make papers knahmsayin'?
Motherfuckin' Kool G. Rap and B1
And my motherfuckin' man Grimm
Just comin' with somethin' to keep the brain stem

It's Big 1 son Jamaica Queens is the turf
And I'ma exploit heaven and earth for what it's worth
It's the MC extraordinaire the jewels glare
The God is rare I'm takin' bitches back to my lair
I want mines and yours, strippin' niggaz to they drawers
No probable cause, with the chrome double 4's
It's the Queens New Yorker with a bulletproof parka
In eighty-four, it was Calvins and British Walkers
Now I'm sippin' Harvey's Bristal Cream with the glock 17
As the sirens race to the scene
Tryin' to get dough, like Pablo, today, fuck tomorrow
Seats for carro, as I recline in Monte Carlo
I got the game down to a science, it's the clients
That turn small time hustlers into giants
Three course meal, waitin' for my appetizer
Blowin' like a geyser, time only makes me wiser
Paraphenalia, and material, makes the crew imperial
I put the fear in you, sippin' beer with two
Handlin' business properly, form a monopoly
Storefront property, if not, another robbery
I'm puttin' forth the effort, murder's the method
The steak is peppered
Son when I let off you meet your Lord and shepherd
Bloody money gets niggaz deaded and wetted
Don't forget it, money's the metal and my hand is magnetic

I gotta flip these bricks
'Cause bein broke drive me insane
Money's on my motherfuckin' brain
From O-Z's to ki's
The triple beam brings fame to my name
Money's on my motherfuckin' brain
Niggaz be schemed teamin'
But still I maintain
Money's on my motherfuckin' brain
'Cause money and murder go hand in hand
It ain't nothin' but a game
Money's on my motherfuckin brain son

Cryin' hopin' God forgive me for the ones I killed
But until still, I dry my eyes with hundred dollar bills
Like McDonald's, makin' mills servin'
Fuck a Landcruiser now, pulls a ? to Suburban
Stressed out, sittin' thinkin' past bed time
Scared can't sleep, nightmares about fed time
Diamonds, linens, ostrich and all that
Fat shit I'm talkin' code cause my phone's tapped
Crackheads worship me like I'm Jesus
Uncle Sam can't stand me cause I'm fuckin' all his nieces
Cuties every color, who I wanna fuck next?
Buy a new car, maybe Lamborghini trunk next
Look at the jealousy in the eyes of the roughnecks
Bulletproof glass just in case they wanna buck Tecs
A large ratio in this game dies
But I'm flippin' pies, til the Senate legalize

[Chorus]

I'm sportin' flavors and Timbs, a ninety-five Benz with the chrome rims
Presidential Rolex, two carat diamonds with the stone gems
Pockets filled with Gucci leather wallets designed by Gucci
Parlay in restaurants, eatin' shrimp, scampi and sushi
Fly minks, with icicles that blink inside Cuban links
Lookin' ?, brothers stink, got loot like I'm doin' banks
Hundred dollar bottles of chammy, condos in Miami
Front row seats up at the Grammy's, the broke niggaz can't stand me
Hold the flame low, hotel suites inside the Flamingo
Just home by the dingos, I step up in em rockin' Kangols
Straight up fakin' no jacks, cause all my crackshacks are jam packed
My mad stacks, show that I'm on the right track, like Amtrak
So stand back, 'cause I'ma make whatever it takes
To shake Jakes, and shoot snakes, and bake more snowflake cakes than Drake's
Cut up your grill like I'm the Barber of Seville
Still like Gotti bodies are found inside the harbor cause I'm ill
It's war, but no more kids are bein kidnapped, matter of fact
Ain't with the shit black, I was young when I did that
There's dope in the Copa Cabanas, cock back the hammers
So niggaz in pajamas get they wigs split like bananas
Stable of hotties, niggaz with shotties catchin' bodies
Neighborhood John Gotti with more notes than Pavarotti
Yeah, paid as a motherfuckin' bank teller
The Goodfella, I stay a motherfuckin' drug seller

Shit ain't never gonna change... Fuck it! 
Time to load the clips, then we take 'em to war. 
Niggaz want to flip, then we take 'em to war. 
Break a nigga proper, then we break him some more. 

I represent the murderers and felony offenders,
Who either bought time out, to get these legal tenders.
(Surrender!) Nah, I'm goin' out with a bang, nigga.
Fuck Pataki, I gotta do my thang, nigga.
Forty-four mag, bustin' into action.
Brains left in particles, fragments and fractions.
Grimm, the money stacker, heat packer.
I'm lurkin', I'm waitin', attackin' like a linebacker. 
Fuck what you heard, crime pays.
And always, unorthodox, I hold my pistol sideways.
We kill crews, hearts go numb,
And if retaliation comes then yo, fuck it, it just comes.
(Yo, who you?) I'm Dr. Death, motherfucker, ever heard of me? 
Close your eyes, cross your fingers, time for surgery.
I'm already dead, so nah, you can't murder me,
'Cause quantities of entities enter me evilly.

[Chorus x 2]

Since I murder for hire, rapid fire's what I require.
Makin' niggaz perspire, so send a message through the wire.
'Cause violence is contagious, it got me bustin' gauges.
The '95 Larry Davis, and I'm wettin' niggaz for wages.
Queens is the home of one, the known felon,
And ain't no tellin', when I'm a crack your fuckin' melon.
For the right amount of chips, I spit clips and hit whips.
Leavin' niggaz bloody, the leather seats is where the shit drips.
With the pound-seven, I be creepin', rockin' niggaz, while they sleepin'.
Shots repeatin', leavin' faggot niggaz leakin'.
When I cock back the iron, niggaz is dyin', marchin' to Zion.
'Cause the pound-cake, roars like a lion.
Word, son, niggaz be collapsin', cause my weapons is
Ready for action, makin' your heart catch contractions.
In the underworld, shootin' gallery niggaz lose calories,
'Cause my salary's based on fatalities.

[Chorus x 2]
 
Here I come to get some motherfuckin' wreck, but first I gotta, 
Um, vest check, uncheck, clip one check, clip two check, I'm set.
So let a motherfucker move a muscle.
When I tussle, they'll be piecin' niggaz back like fuckin' puzzles.
'Cause Kool G. Rap is known for bringin' mad noise, a bad boy.
When I was younger, always carried guns, I never had toys.
Grimm, gimme the infrared, they see me, and I'm puttin' red dots
On niggaz foreheads, to makin' motherfuckers indian.
You got beef? Go get yourself a wreath, because it's murder. 
'Cause I put holes in my beef, like fuckin' White Castle burgers.
So now I gots to run up on a clown with the fo' pound.
Cock back, rock black, gun a nigga down.
I see 'em, he's comin' out the fuckin' Coliseum,
And hopped into a B-M, shit! 
Put in my clip, and then I dipped into the ride that my man had, 
Parked on the sidewalk, then we start to glide.
I'm rainin' on him, (faster nigga.) oh yeah, we're gainin' on him.
(Oh shit, he's with somebody else.)  Fuck it, put his brain on him.
Boom, boom, no survivors, lifted the nigga out his seat.
When they find him, he'll be a backseat driver.
But I ain't finished with the trigger yet, I'm lightin' up a cigarette.
Bang, bang, I left the other nigga wet.

Kool G Rap,"Let me tell you 'bout this girl, maybe I shouldn't
I met her in Philly and her name was Brown Sugar
See, we be making love constantly
That's why my eyes are a shade blood burgundy

The way that we kiss is unlike any other way
That I be kissin' when I'm kissin' what I'm missin'
Won't you listen?

Brown Sugar babe, I gets high off your love
I don't know how to behave

I want some of your Brown Sugar, sugar

Oh sugar when you're close to me
You love me right down to my knees
And whenever you let me hit it
Sweet like the honey when it comes to me
Skin is caramel with those cocoa eyes
Even got a big sister by the name of Chocolate Thai

Brown Sugar babe, I gets high off your love
I don't know how to behave

Well it's that street flavor neighbor that I smack upon this track
So throw that tobacco outta that Philly, dump in the illy and sit back
And get with bubonic chronic, the pond green bionic
My brown eyes get Chinese, high frequencies like Panasonic
I gets dumb when I hits one, for when you splits one and twists one
If you ain't with getting blitzed son then straight up you missed one
I be high til I die, blowing lye smoke up in the sky
Getting bumbed from the trum and hella else from chocolate thai
So fly the friendly get highs, we wise guys with red eyes
Bigger than life sized, for the pies we terrorize
While getting blunted enemies get hunted, we don't front it
Son if you want it, it'll be a murder mystery like Whodunit
Steady, get ready to step to that next level
Fearless like a daredevil, bounce this and pass a sack to the ear level
So come get with the program as I slam
He run that old flim flam then you can catch a blam blam and I don't give a
Damn

Now that be how the story goes
Brown sugar got me open, now I want some more
Always down for a menagie-a-trois
But I think I'll hit it solo where my niggas won't mind
Stick out my tongue and I'm about to hit this gritty 
Pretty bitty with persistence
Yo I don't think y'all hear me

I want some of your brown sugar",Brown Sugar,1995
Kool G Rap,"The time has come, we gotta expand, the whole operation
Distribution, New York, to Chicago, L.A.
We gotta set our own market, and enforce it

Champagne wishes of caviar dreams ?a penis didn't cream?
With sales of fish scales from triple beams I gleam
Livin' the live of rowdy packin' fifty cali's
Rockin' lizard Bally's while we do our drug deal in a dark alley
Up in casinos just me and my dino primo
Pushin' beam-o's then parlay in Reno with two fly Latinos
Nas, he runs the whole staff, we count mad for seen bad
We've seen a half a milli dashin' out there on the Queens half
Three major players gettin' papers by the layers
And those that portray us on the block get rocked like Domateus
Fakers get used to shootin' targets, soon as the dark hits
Front on the drug market, bodies get rolled up in a carpet
Those that cheat us try to beat us we got hookers with heaters
That'll stray pop and put more shells in your top than Adidas
Da leaders, lookin' straight crimy in our Giorgio Armani's
You wanna harm me and Nas you gots ta come get through a whole army

Everywhere we go, people know who we are

So we're plottin' up a scheme to get the seven figure cream

Yo I got, guns from Italy, smoke trees, considerably
Mid-state and Green it seems, is where all my niggaz be
The ghetto misery, shootouts and liquor stores
A perpendicular, angle of the clout war
Police searchin' up my Lex over who's petrol
My tech blows straight off the roof and tests yo' respect though
But dough don't respect me, it got me handcuffed
The rough life, I just be up nights, breathin' with scuffed Nike's
Pour my beers for my peoples under the stairs
These years I got they names in my swears
Poppin' Cristal like it's my first child, lickin' shots, holiday style
Rockin' Steele sweaters, Wallaby down
Twenty-four carats, countin' cabbage, like the Arabs
The marriage of me and the mic is just like magic
Elegant performance, bubble Lex full insurance
Guzzlin' Guinness shootin' catchin' cases concurrent
It's Nas, seven hundred wives, King Solomon size
We on the rise, me and G, ghetto wise guys

Green papers with eagles from a tray that's illegal

Yeah yeah, get this money, yeah
Brother you've got to make it happen
When you're living in the fast life, hey yeah yeah

Aiyyo my lifestyle's exquisite, yayo like a blizzard
It's choir attire standin' on ground with one pivot
Two players rockin' silk blazers and diamonds like glaciers
Lands with name brand seats reclinin' like in spaceships
Bodies on ice
Livin' trife, rollin' fixed up dice
Gamblin' Grants
Handlin' stamps
Moves are sheist
My bankrolls, got the cops comin' in plain clothes
Tryin' to arraign again cause of our fame that's how the game goes
True
Right out the slammer with the fame and glamor
Cookin' up grams with Arm & Hammer supplyin' scramblers in Alabama
Rub out faces and leave no traces
My aces got mad body cases, preserve spaces at the horse races
Servin' us Dom P my cliquo
Dimes with magnifico, puttin' in cut inside perico
Heat for foes, shoppin' sprees with my fleet for clothes
In Caribbean suites, deep, rippin' beats with flows
Aiyyo, we went from standin' on blocks, without some socks
Sellin' rocks, to pickin' up stock and boat docks with Glocks
And got poppy seed fields with million dollar bills
Packin' all the blue steel we keeps it real inside the battlefield
Yeah so here's a toast to the funds and things
Gun smokes in rings, graveyards is buried with kings

Color or creed, is no need for a man to bleed

Unless it's diluted, for somethin' to intrude it
Then I see your family tree was uprooted
So don't be foolish if you're Jewish or Hindu
The racial manual is the evil that men do
I was raised in a nation of Asian
Hate shouldn't separate Jamaican from Haitian
So if you're givin' in your ears I hope your hear me and
Siberian's no better than Nigerian
I bring a rattle to a battle that you see me in
I'm no villain so why would I be killin' Indians
My nationality's reality
And yo a prejudiced man is of a devil mentality
These are words of a wise man, wisdom
Take a taste and erase the racism

The stainless bisket will leave your brain smoking 
Your whole frame broken and clothes soaken, head blown the fuck open 
Try to step inside of fort and get caught 
Wit the trey pound shorter left on the sidewalks of New York 
The decompose, blood flows are holes in your clothes, eyes closed 
Body be frozed, posing for pictures with a rose 
Head to your toes, look like you got wetted with a hose 
The road you choose got your brain drain through your nose, nigga 
So who be committing crimes, dangerous minds, put two to your spine 
Lay you behind enemy lines 
When we cross it and leave you like a broken faucet 
The underworld production family can reinforce it 
(Mobb Deep) 
Yo, when shit get real, it ain't what you expected 
Me and kikos are known to get hectic 
Only to wreck shit, many slugs in all directions 
Make you see the light when my shot makes connections 
Niggas get their face split in section 
Shooked, using ice grilled looks for they protection 
?We saw? everything you fear 
And indulging in crime-filled atmosphere 
This shit ain't nuttin' new, it's only things that we used to 
We used to stick niggas on the F through to 
The E train, when it's time to recruit 
I humble on the D train, see my man D, Don't need to purchase my 
cocaine 
Word to my newborn seed 
A nigga gotta make loot to support greed 
On the wildside of the fence, the shit is on the verge of explosion 
It's so cold, you might get frozen 
If you leave yourself vulnerable and time lasping 
Fools collasping and caught up in gun clapping 
No matter who you are if you know many faces 
I don't discriminate, my shot bleed all races 
And coaches, we sorts like vultures 
Eating your insides like ulcers and pour niggas closer nigga

",Know da Game,1997
Kool G Rap,"Here I am, R-A-W 
Terrorist, here to bring trouble to 
Phoney emcees, I move on and seize 
I just conquer, and stomp another rapper with ease 
Cause I'm at my apex and others are be-low 
Nothing but a milliliter, I'm a kilo 
Second to none, making emcees run 
So don't try to step to me, cause I ain't the one 
I relieve rappers just like Tylenol 
And they know it, so I don't see why you all 
Try to front, perpetrating a stunt 
When you know that I'll smoke you up like a blunt 
I'm genuine like Gucci, raw like sushi 
The Sage of Rage is what rap did to me 
To make me want to create chaos and mayhem 
Cold rock a party, until the A.M. 
I'll make a muscle, grab the mic and hustle 
While you stand dazed and amazed, I'll bust a little rhyme 
With authority, superiority 
And captivate the whole crowd's majority 
The rhymes I use definitely amuse 
Better than Dynasty or Hill Street Blues 
I'm sure to score, endure for more without a flaw 
'Cause I get raw! 

I give a speech like a reverend, rappers start severin' 
And in my lifetime, believe I've never been beaten 
Or eaten, or just tookin' out 
You know, come to think about, I keep emcees lookin' out 
And real nervous, when I'm at your service 
So give me that title boy, you don't deserve this 
I work like a slave to become a master 
And when I say a rhyme, you know that it has ta 
Be perfectly fitted, cause I'm committed 
The entertainer and trainer and Kane'll get with it 
I go and flow and grow to let you know, I'll damage ya 
I'm not an amateur but a professional unquestionable, without a doubt superb 
So full of action, my name should be a verb 
My voice will float, on every note 
When I clear my throat, that's all she wrote 
The minute that the Kane starts to go on 
Believe it's gonna be smooth sailing so sail on 
As I put other rappers out of their misery 
Get em in a battle and make them all history 
Rulin' and schoolin', emcees that I'm duelin' 
Watch em all take a fall, as I sit back coolin' 
On a throne, with a bronze microphone 
Uhm, God bless the child that can hold his own 
'Cause I get raw!  

Chillin', killin' like a villain 
The meaning of RAW is Ready And Willing 
To do whatever is clever, take a loss never 
And the rhymes I bust, comin' off is a must 
And I come off hard with rhymes that are odd 
I rip the microphone and leave it scarred 
Never smokin' or hittin' or takin' a sniff 
Only crushin' emcees that be tryin' to riff 
I get strong and titanic, do work like a mechanic 
Make emcees panic, they all get frantic 
And skeptic, like a girl on a contraceptive 
As I rocked, but hey, what you expected? 
I'll get raw for ya, just like a warrior 
Rather like a samurai, and I'll be damn if I 
Ever let a Fisher-Price emcee hang 
Their rhymes are toy, nothing but ying yang 
So if we battle on the microphone 
Bring your own casket and tombstone 
And I'ma preach your funeral, tell me who in the world 
Could ever come with more, I get raw!",Raw,1998
Kool G Rap,"Aw yeah word up word to mother. Here comes G. Rap with another one why'all. 
 We going to swing it like this... 
 I'm right in front of my front steps thinking of a plan 
 Looking like Raggedy Ann no dough in hand kicking a can 
 Thinking of a plot to pull some bank in 
 Because I'm dead and stinking 
 Soles on my shoes winking t shirt is shrinking 
 Soon I see some ties and my eyes open wide quick 
 Who's that with you, chick? Bill Blass my sidekick 
 What's up, black? Give his hand a smack 
 Up pulls a Cadillac, yo baby we'll be back 
 Jumped right on inside, not too many people saw us 
 Thinking about who gotta get robbed because the mob got a job for us 
 The drove us down to the sober section 
 Of town where the clowns don't be paying for protection 
 The want us to send a message to Jimmy the bartender 
 Lend a friend the money next you're ripping off his car fenders 
 He's coming up short cause he snorts 
 Coke, dope, nope, and hope he don't get caught 
 He owes some Benjamin Franklins, every last bit of em 
 But Jimmy's pockets are empty, so now we gotta get rid of him 
 But Jimmy's wife is with him and they don't want to involve her 
 Hopped out the back seat they gave me a revolver 
 Blass, you distract him while I go and whack him 
 Entered through the back side of the bar and then attacked him 
 He's screaming for his life, reaching for his wife 
 Shot him in the back of the head and shanked him with a knife 
 And that goes for anybody who's gotta pay they dues 
 You lose, cause I got the Ill Street Blues 
 
[Chorus:] 
 You lose, cause I got the Ill Street Blues (repeat 4x) 
 Suckers I clobber, because my town is full of cops and robbers 
 You're not promised tomorrow in this Little Shop of Horrors 
 So I got to get with the business of hit quick 
 Moneygrip's pocket's looking thick so I stick Slick 
 Hold it right here, hands in the air, I know you got the loot 
 Or better yet, face down on the ground, empty your pockets troop 
 Hit the deck I got the Tech right on your neck 
 And I expect to make a buck to heck with a traveller's check 
 But if a vic' tries to choke me 
 I'll have to smoke him like I'm Smokey the Bear, so okie dokie 
 Goodbye, or bon voyage, have a good journey 
 Don't even try begging for your life, that don't concern me 
 So to the next weasel that freezes 
 Your begging and your pleases only getting your closer to meeting Jesus 
 Yeah, I shake a schmuck just to make a buck 
 Then I break a duck and if the duck gotta get bucked then I don't give a fuck 
 Hyper as a sniper piping niggas like a plumber 
 Cold vicking and sticking up the ones that run the numbers 
 Or even a bigger score, the lady in the liquor store 
 Go inside and kick in the door, pull her then I'm stickin her for 
 Money or your life, honey hurry and choose 
 You lose, because I got the Ill Street Blues 
 
 [Chorus] 
 
 Extra extra read all about it in the papers 
 The boss tried to rape us, so we tossed him off the skyscraper 
 Because he pulled some other people to try and hit us 
 Get us, but none of them did us, he must be trying to kid us 
 But that's dead, I'll thank God in the red, 'cross the bread borders 
 So nobody can short us, he fled down to headquarters 
 Ready to put some work in, we're not a lazy crew, we'll do a job or two 
 But yo, the man can't even stick me with some Crazy Glue 
 Ready to tore him even more because she saw him 
 We took out all the lookouts in the front and kicked his door in 
 What's up snake, why'd you violate? 
 Because I'm a hossa (What's that?) 
 Yo, that's a pig that don't fly straight 
 Getting ready to jab him, I grabbed him by the necktie 
 Homie tried to get fly, and swing I gave him a decked eye 
 You know the evil that men do, hell is where the men go 
 We snatched him by his hands and feet and threw him out the window 
 Up, up, and away cause I don't play, clown 
 Buck, buck, buck, take that with you on the way down 
 I'm hoping you got springs and wings on your shoes 
 But you lose, because I got the Ill Street Blues

 you and ya bimbo get hit up through ya car window 
 creep on your benz slow and let ten blow 
 from out the darkest shadow 
 my aim's straight as an archers arrow 
 I'll spark this barrel 
 hit my target even if the mark is narrow

Kool G Rap,"I dreamed that I was at a club scene where all the thugs be 
 Every criminal mug be living in luxury what the fuck G? 
 That must be Bugsy in the black tux over there with Lucky 
 Bring my heater niggaz might try to slug me 
 Take me out in back of the club and buck me and touch me 
 I felt a hand tug me then turnin around I peeped the lovely 
 Fly face fat ass gave me a glass of bubbly said 
 ""Compliments of Bugsy "" then took me across the persian rug to plug me 
 He shook my hand and hugged me; thought he would do me ugly 
 but he dug me, pockets chubby said, ""Nino where them drugs be?"" 
 Over there by the derby, buy they dirty devils from me 
 to keep my paper sturdy, yo word G 
 I ain't afraid to get my hands dirty, you heard me? 
 I be D and fuck all that living thirsty, so Nino 
 do his out in Jersey, showin no mercy, with Frank Nitty 
 who else and, some nigga with a Babyface that they called Nelson 
 Bad for your health, Machine Gun Kell' and your Dillinger 
 Death messenger, known to carry the six cylinder 
 Look for my army, fatigues to Giorgio Armani's 
 Holdin the Tommy, no one can harm me; Will and Tommy 
 tried to alarm me and quote, he turned to smoked salami 
 Dead as a motherfuckin zombie, full of my ammo 
 With Bugs Mirando, against the grain so, gotta send him 
 over the rainbow, he must be brain slow, caught him down 
 at the train po' in Santo Domingo, left him for dead 
 Two bullets in his Tango, like how that movie Shane go 
 Frank Costello, hostile fellow, he murders while remainin mellow 
 but most of the niggaz on his team was yellow 
 Cold blooded veins flowin with red Jell-o 
 There's Joe Adonis, had mad dramas, won't hesitate 
 to put you in pajamas, fly hooker fine as the Pocahontas 
 Beauty queen you'll wanta pok-her-hiendas 
 Frank broke a promise between the organized crimers and old timers 
 Costello gotta go six below, nobody voted no 
 to veto, so they hit him with a hollow torpedo 
 Up in his torso, he ain't a boss so, he can go 
 without ever lettin the whole police force know 
 Lex Diamond was scheamin on Capone's scroll 
 Wanted to own his whole zone, it leaked out 
 They shot him at a pay phone 
 with the big chrome, his whole wig blown 
 Blood flowin from out his flesh and bones 
 At the wake at the funeral home it's havoc 
 Family got hit up with automatics 
 Non-stop static inside the rackets 
 Jack McGern was burnin split Joe Adonis cabbage 
 The underworld was goin savage 
 Pretty Boy Floyd was non-void, unemployed, he destroyed shit 
 with the Infamous click, wasn't to be toyed with 
 Mad jealous of all the liquor sellers 
 Shinin with wine cellars, turn em from hood dwellers to Goodfellas 
 Me and Nitty was like bank tellers, nothin niggaz could tell us 
 We drove all over, I pushed a shiny yellow Testarossa 
 Moved on it closer get the toaster 
 Started to feel like death was closer, I hit Capone hard 
 Murder him and his bodyguard in they car and dust the chaffeur 
 Beef over, I blew him like a supernova 
 Niggaz nicknamed me, The Black Cobra 
 The Lady Casanova, yo I'm even deadly when I'm sober 
 Act like you got a chip on your shoulder 
 And blast the two right through your boulder 
 Money you didn't know they shoulda told ya 
 Nigga you fuckin with a soldier, wake up and smell the Folgers 
 Niggaz out here done lie in piss to cover up the odor 
 Operations from here to Minnesota to Dakota 
 But yo here comes Greasy Thumbs, who wants to get the easy funds 
 He whispered in my eardrum 
 ""Let's take over the entire city, and split the dough 
 Me you and Frank Nitty and Siegel and that'll make the bank pretty"" 
 No doubt before we go we gotta murder John Torre 
 Yo get all his territory dough and end the story yo",Mobsta's,1998

 Last night got caught in a gunfight I think it was like 
 four niggaz clutchin they burners and bustin 
 but only could see one in sight 
 The one on my right yo son he like we both got gripe 
 He wanted my life come at a nigga 
 with a gun and a knife 
 He tryin to make the wiped out nigga layin up under the white 
 But I ain't tryin to go up in no dark tunnel 
 and burn to the light 
 And let myself be one more nigga that just got spun in the night 
 And done in on sight, and tryin to breathe 
 with one in my pipe 
 But I'm not one of the type, and I'd rather lose all hung on the mic 
 Than to be up in the yard receivin CPR 
 at one in the night 
 Now I can run and take fllght, but alright, yo son'll be hyped 
 And I've played mother nature before 
 so yo I'm clappin thunder tonight 
 I step right, inside of the street light, my gun it was bright 
 Send him to kiss Christ, and let my shit slice 
 in front of him twice 
 Let one splice, cause fuckin with price, ain't tryin to be nice 
 I want him on ice, no back home 
 to a son and a wife 
 He tried roll dice with real life and got his buns in a vice 
 Nigga was all enticed to lead his life sheist 
 but none of it's nice 
 I peeped shit, and seen his whole click, was runnin in fright 
 instead of comin to fight, get someone to fight 
 you son of a dykes 
 With one in the pipe, I'm aimin to light the one on the right 
 They all deceased, so yo my asspiece 
 get hunted for life 
 Four niggaz cut down, and I can receive one hundred to life 
 up in a jailcell, that's crawlin with lice 
 and runnin with mice 
 Live trife, fillin appetities with nothin but rice 
 Slow biz and no kid's nigs 
 start runnin my wife

 Three birds'll blow up in the back seat, I swear to God fuck 
 she could've been a model, Coke bottle figure, instead 
 she bent it just like a Desperado, left her hair hollow 
 Two slugs to swallow -- whose next to follow?

 Clappin hazardous, who these niggaz is with low shot averages 
 Bustin right back at they cabbages, givin em flashbacks 
 of baby carriages, this mexican inside this Lex is 
 tryin to crash my shit, drivin reckless 
 Look like he desperate 
 Pulled down the tinted glass and let the Tec spit 
 It's hectic, car flew in bodega with his neck hit 
 Body and head was separate, totally disconnected 
 Bust back two shots 
 at ones that standin with cannons up on the rooftops 
 that drew glocks, but my 20/20 spot em for two blocks 
 I'm wettin shit like it's rainfall they doin dew drops 
 Two more shots came out saloon doors 
 I'm blowin shit up like platoon wars

 Don't know who is this kid, you better check the formula 
 Before I have to send these busters, just to warm you up 
 Man, Homicide be looking for whoever tore you up 
 Flood up the whole block with paramedics and coroners 
 I can roll up all by myself and make a street close 
 Yo you could be twenty deep and still get your feet rose 
 Believe me, ain't none of them running up when heat blow 
 You sleep though, you're whole sweet and low 
 Free to go, deeper than six feet low 
 This wiseguy's enterprise, we emphasize who ever die 
 Never sympathize, still on the rise, no matter how many we minimize

 Some real thugs conduct the drug traffic in the skies 
 Never high, we lay low, stay unidentified, it's all live

 One day your counting money, next yo you digging holes 
 Don't try to do this at home, this is professionals 
 Congressionals, street medal, award winners 
 Making a point that's hollow, do you follow, want to meet tomorrow? 
 What, greet the heffer with the pink pucker, sucker 
 Cut out your luck with a wink of an eye 
 Make ya die, make ya fly in the sky, you asking why? 
 While your souls floating over me, you owing me 
 You shouldn't been owing me, not blowing me

 Nickel plate pros made men who make those 
 My red eye don't ? but best believe it shakes those 
 Reflex reaction if i hear you disrespect the fashion 
 Fuck these niggas, like menage, giving them double action

 Using my dome, causes to notify your next of kin

 As a ten then again she was probably an eight 
 Her ass was kinda phat so she moved me yo 
 When I scoped out her mental was straight said let's roll 
 Stared this shorty everynight and everyday 
 On the rebound around left right and hey 
 I'm a critical brother when it comes down to broads 
 But this wop here is like the Grammy Awards 
 Had style and grace and class a lot of taste 
 On a slow dance we romance around my place 
 Like a king from queens is how she made me feel 
 And if I did dirt it was locked and sealed 
 No doubt was all about me and my love thing 
 If the phone called Paul I was lettin it ring 
 Absolutely, she looped me the hook was good 
 Niggaz buggin on me buggin in my neighbor hood 
 Yeah boss, but on course is my game plan and 
 Shorty wop keep me chillin with the name brand 
 Kicks and whips, going all out chicks, flicks and tours 
 Yeah you know who you is kid truly yours 
 This I dedicate to the mixtapes I hate 
 Exclusive shit it really holds no weight 
 Put ya skills on the plate backspin to eighty-eight 
 Now this I dedicate to a girl I hate 
 Try to post fly with ya Mabeline eye 
 Sportin DKNY working on ya alibi 
 Imitation at best Miss American Express

 Here to let you know were not the mens

 Ave yo go head hood rat 
 I can't see where ya any good at 
 Put that trash back on tha rack 
 You a put back a stripper 
 Just like a chicken peckin wherever wood at 
 You sewer rat better be careful where you step ya foot at 
 You might get snapped, caught in the trap 
 Sneekin bout a cheese stack so sewer that and ease back 
 You fleece that it's G Rap many cats want to be that 
 Better believe that iced up, find me where it's below zero degrees at 
 Skis at see the G stack puffin on scarface and Garcia Vegas

 Both of us together we bomb makers bottles of Dom breakers

Some niggaz get blown off the atlas
It happens unsolved mystery re-enatmus
Get practiced what you lack is
You think like the average
Jake stoop down and leavin' crime scenes entangled
Nothing but cannons get conspicuous
Like a man a little branded with the serial scratched
Wild out a part of the pack 'cause they made me like that
If I could push back the clock probably leave it like that
Draw blood for my nigga G.O.D, Ty Nitty and Twin
And Twin is not here plus my kin
Killa B forever with me
Quick to settle with me
Into QB to show love throughout the years with me
You got guns we got guns the serious ones

It be the ones standin' still that'll peel guns
Spill blood for my duns thuggin' for me
Man you don't wanna get involved fuckin' with Pee
I spent more nights illin' less nights chillin'
The more shots they hold the better they feel it
What be the dealizz
Some killas like to hide behind specs
Others got blatant disrespectin' the rest
Or so young that you wouldn't even expect
To be burstin' off guns like a vietnam vet
On the steps
Sittin' in the staircase bent
Thinkin' on ways to take another man's head
Go to war with niggas that's against what I rep
I settle things with a heavy metal fifth
Change clips
Switch clothes after I spit
Put niggas back in they place for shit that's on the mind kid

One two, one two
We dedicate this one to the hip-hop culture why'all
Brought to you by the WOOOORRRLLLD FAMOUS Wake-Up Show!

[RZA]
Bobby Steels, Staple' tails, MC's get your lips stapled
Project Killa Hill is stamped on the map like the compass
Sacred sword play tongue-twist, piercin holes in you
You can't escape, 70,000 kilowatts blast through your box
Woke wit alarm clocks, cars drivin slow down the block
One stopped, parks pops his trunk
Snare pops loud as glock shots
Bass like an M-80 in your face, cops stop, give us citation
We pause for radio station identification
WAKE UP WAKE UP WAKE UP!

[Tech N9NE]
When I Woke-Up, I got the mic and never chocked up
Busted a verse and all the G's in Cali loc'ed up when I was summoned
Styles were mixed like the Drummonds, Killer Clown is comin
Look around, your town is crumblin
This Big Tech from the midwest, leavin MC's lipless
On The Wake-Up Show, make up no, stories about my shake-up flow
Put me off in a cipher? Potna, you can't fuck wit the sniper
Your flow's premature, clean your dirt diaper
Mic heister, psycho, alpha-schizo
Hypno, chryo-gat flow, guru and ain't nobody tighter
Sway & Tech heard me flow and its sealed
Now I got Swedish women yelling ""Tech N9NE's filled""

[Eminem]
This place is my house, I might as well erase my face wit Withe-out
'cause why'all can't see me like Mase's eyebrows (where you at?)
Climped out of a nice house, 
Through the front window and heard this guy shout
""Hey that's my couch, bitch!""
Pull a nine out during a rhyme bout
While I'm rippin this shit, put a clip in it spit five rounds
And murder you hoes worse than flippin a convertible
Nose first wit the top off landin upside-down
You're tied down and duct-taped, fuck rape
I'd rather just hump a slut's leg wit my nuts shaved
And Sway & Tech, two disk jokeys 
Breakin so many friggin needles I wonder if they inject

[Xzibit]
Lo and behold, better than platinum or gold
Yes God bless success, never forsake your soul
Xzibit take control, locked loaded and ready to roll
Play the upper hand, a man that's never gon' fold
'cause your tape sucks, find a new hobby that you can take up
Or listen to my niggas Tech & Sway so you can Wake-Up
The X-man, catch me doin drills in the Danger Room
Big game hunting, from high-noon to the full moon

[Pharoahe Monch]
Wit synonyms, I get an adrenaline rush
From minimum thrusts, bust multiple assualts in small interims
As horrid as Borris Kolaf was
When I cut your neck, leave a little piece of flesh
So the head won't fall off, hauled-off
Sawed-off shotgun blast, he asked
Why did he have to die like cast metal?
O, huh, see now like Omar Credle
We pone pedal at a high resolution 
On the Wake-Up Show wit Sway, Tech and DJ Revolution

[Kool G Rap]
I sway the tech wit the Tech and Sway
Step away, wet and spray, rep the day
Who over debt to pay get swept away
Across the whole board like checker play
When I blaze your whole sect' arrays
Wake-Up Show for those slept away
Niggas that the trey, hit the deck and pray
DJ Revolution, spinnin like lead from out the heck-AK
Tearin your neck away, flood up the street wit bloody decora'
Until the head of jake investigate

[Jayo Felony]
What? Sway can give it to you, but Whatcha Gon' Do wit it
Tech can give it to you, but Whatcha Gon' Do?
Rev can give it to you, but Whatcha Gon' Do wit it
I can give it to you, Wha Wha Wha What What!

[Chino XL]
Yo yo Chino makes the world go 'round
Fuckin up entire record companies like Harrel did to Motown
Vominous talk, poison pen, hominous walk
What flow will I destroy wit this time, the most commonest thought
The drama that's brought, caught us in a midst of sibling rivalry
For instance, there's nothing in existence that can survive wit me
Clone me like sheep, I clean house like Tony Rand-all
Wit style filed for sexual harassment like Tisha Camp-bell
You're wack like Will Smith, your rhyme style is pansy
I fuckin murder your young style like JonBenet Ramsey
Now who the master to beg? Your demo gets passed on the reg'
You shouldn't have been signed if you had a Withe cast on your leg
I'm Wake-Up Show reppin wit Sway & Tech
My tec's like Tekken, the industry weapon
I'm Chino X, bring KRS in

[KRS-One]
De de de de de de da di day, KRS-One comin wit the Tech & Sway
Yo, I rock up the littlest set, and on the biggest set
As ill as it gets I still manage to wiggle your neck wit sweat
Never forget, the bigger the budget the bigger the debt
You gotta be willin to rock in the middle of dry and in the middle of wet
But I'm willin to bet, on a Sway & a Tech
They stay in effect, never been a pain in the neck, they gainin respect
Nevertheless I WRECK YOU, now you know what Sway & Tech do
I'll be back but for now just sackle!

Raise a prophet, make hot lava spit out like vomit
We Vietnam it, scramble ya brain like an omelette
Spling baby link the bomb it, keep you reek niggas in bondage
A convicts we Allah, then we bomb it
We trom it, it take a Terror Squad to dis arm it
We layin with grenades in our palms, two hours longer

Ah shit nigga, you got me started momma one of the good boys
Said she got a 400 pound retarted Bronx nigga from the Projects
What nigga you don't want it, cock figga figga got it
You make me sick, fuckin wit Pun, youse a crazy bitch
Hold him for ransom, or cut off his tongue in cause he itchin

Probably socks soes inside the trenches
Closin in for miles to inches, killin the distance, enemy flinches

Burn a slug make the land glow

Everyday I gotta be strapped, 'cause niggas don't know how to act
You don't wanna go the gap, 'cause T-Squad gonna react
Whatta we go? thugs and ammo, by a hundred tons of guns and rambos
Just in case you comin Commando
I'm a Sopranos and Corleones wit they own armies
And a couple of morrenos that'll die for me

Hammers a law under the camouflage here to take jars
Put a cap inside ya cap and leave a four in your sarge

For every round sabotage, bodies hit the ground hard

Kool G Rap,"Chorus (Kool G. Rap)
N.Y. City, crime around me, drug dynasties
Death and robberies 
On the dark blocks where bodies bleed
Jake inside the P.J.'s, the heat waves
Kids play where heat sprays
Straight floods, no love, fake thugs
Draw blood with Four-Four snubs
Tear away your rug
Kids with clout 
Up in the Range Rover with chicks, spray in their mouth
Drain 'em out, set up for the wet up, bang 'em out
These streets in Queens remain the murder scene, blood stain 'em out
(repeat)

Verse 1: (Kool G. Rap)
Inside the chambers of Hell
Where all the L puffin' niggas dwell
And fell 'cause of a loss of blood cells
Bullet shells, glass is shattered
Shit gets torn and tattered
Niggas brains is splattered on sewage drains when they be goin' at it
Static over addicts, revolvers and automatics 
It's illmatic how I seen one catch two in the cabbage
From an initial, official shiny nickel played pistols
Sparklin' like crystals, launchin' missiles
Domes get blown like whistles
Ain't no jokin', niggas will leave you and your Momma soakin'
And smokin' and blown open
Bodies found in Hoboken
Kids comittin' murder after murder
Shit is real so I feel for the ones that don't pack steel and burners
Bodies be droppin' down around Queens 
By different teams, it's the Teens that tear your ass out the frame by
The seams
The end of the drama center, niggas you want drama?
Word to Momma come equipped with two clips and body armor. 

Chorus 
Verse 2: (Jinx Da Juvy)
Yeah, it's that young fella, Jinx Da Juvy
Fly lil' nigga, iced out with a fresh brand new Coogi
Jigged out, wig spinned out with waves
Pockets full of the Franklins, I stay gettin' paid
Stay stackin' papes, plus my Fam flip cakes
While some of us rap, other fellas flip 'caine
Rock big chains, what ya'll think this a game?
Murder incorp. slash open cases with cartels
We do things that make the Mob tell
The way we go outta state and flip more cakes then Carvel
Ya'll play the cut, and watch this lil' nigga prevail
'cause I spit much hotter than Hell
So why ya'll playa hate and plot to creep on mine
I pay ya'll no mind, but violate and speak to the Nine
I'm a B.K. Son of a gun 
When I spit 16 bars ya'll rap niggas dial 911
I'm only 14, and ya'll rap dudes ready to run
This ain't a game, ain't no time for fun
I'm the young rap Lord, so I gotta hold it down
It's Easy Mo Bee, G. Rap and Jinx Da Juvenile. 

Verse 3: (Kool G. Rap)
Crushed with the ice, get rushed for your life
Busted in twice, stuck with a knife
On these rough nights we hustle and heist
Put heaters to your Man and double the price
Snuffin' your lights, shake you like a couple of dice
Nothin' is nice, prepare for combat
Firearm cats with long gats, end up where you get embalmed at
Lay on the floor flat, pull the gat format
Direct beside your door mat 
Cock the Fours back, blow out your Whore's back
Leave the kids wigs tore back
My niggas ride with me like horseback
Go to war rats, niggas you strapped? let me take that 
G. Rap face slap all of these fake cats
And unofficials, get gun missiles clapped in your lung tissue
Me and my Dun's'll hit you, slugs not even one'll miss you
Tons of pistols 
Kid, you got guns?, you should've brung 'em wit' you
Them niggas runnin' wit' you
Caught 'em and hung 'em wit' you
No games, out to blow frames with Fo' flames
At close range, have all you niggas lookin' for Rogaine.

Kool G Rap,"Yeah, check this shit out
Cool G. Rap and my dog Big L
Holdin it di-down, ya heard?

Aiyyo, I heard your single, you better make a whole new song
If they said that shit is hot then they told you wrong
Clown niggaz, you ain't got a chance at all
Big L Corleone too advanced for y'all
I make moves and boss all across the world
So don't be upset if I toss your girl
I got cheddar to blow, pockets never get low
Bitches sweat me wherever I go
I cruise in a GS Lex', Cartier specs
Nautica sweats with the fresh Gortex
Jewels with baguettes, swingin' like the Mets
Throwin' the dice and takin' all size bets
Never bummy; sip rummy, get money
When I hit honeys you felt the dick in her tummy
On the le-low I see dough from here to Rio
Flamboyant Records, see to the E-O - what?

Yo, all of y'all weak people fall back
G. Rap and Big L, we all that
Goin' back to back where they brawl at
Swing and walk with tall bats
Leavin' big holes with small gats
Have 'em all fallin' where the wall at
All of y'all weak people fall back
G. Rap and Big L, we all that
Goin' back to back where they brawl at
Swing and walk with tall bats
Leavin' big holes with small gats
Have 'em all fallin' where the wall at

Yo, from the spot to the cell blocks
Hot as hell blocks where shells pop
Where they sell rock to cop the SL drop
Hood bitches in nail shops; no good snitches that tell cops
People find bodies in lobbies, you can smell shots
Niggaz turn stale on the Rock until they bail drop
New York livin', got a nigga four-fifth limpin'
Send you as a gift to the mortician
If you forfeit livin' - my fortune is forbidden
I say it one time before spittin'
Then I leave your forehead drippin'
I laid low then came back for more bread grippin'
More thread flippin'
More head from chickens, it's time to turn the ape loose
Bust out the cage and let the gauge loose
Blow the feathers out of your Nordface goose
It's G. Rap comin' back with a click of brave troops
Have y'all niggaz runnin' for home base like Babe Ruth
Have you holdin' holes in your body like you play flute
Lay you down till you get found up in the sprayed Coupe
Prepare for the takeover, give you the face makeover
The seedier row and sheet draped over
Be found on the block with the street taped over
Or comin out of deep coma, your speech made slower
Corona Queens shakedown, I'm comin' with the nickel-plate pound
To trade rounds with all you fake clowns get down in the unsafe town
Lacin' it down, black guerilla fams kid we takin' the crown
Ya heard?

Yo, all of y'all weak people fall back
G. Rap and Big L, we all that
Goin' back to back where they brawl at
Swing and walk with tall bats
Leavin' big holes with small gats
Have 'em all fallin' where the wall at
All of y'all weak people fall back

Kool G Rap,"These niggas ain't thugs, the real thugs is the government
Don't matter if you independent, democrat or republican
Niggas politickin the street, get into beef
Start blastin, now a new cat is executive chief
With a, passion for heat you get, blast in yo' seat
Die before you crash in yo' Jeep, never passion in your sleep
Like an old man, you ain't a fool you got a whole plan
To conquer territories like Europeans who stole land
The future of your whole fam' hang in the balance
You the king, and your block is the palace
Y'all niggas is the parliament, untouchable, spot unrushable
Keep your weight wet, call in collect to save a buck or two
Get mad, who the fuck are you? What you gonna do?
Exactly what I thought, NOTHIN, in the sport of frontin
You the undisputed champion, I'm in a class you can't be in
My words is flesh like Jesus, the aquarian

It's just a chapter of the night, in the ghetto afterlife
Where you just seen or heard about or gonna have to fight
Where they sacrifice the life and niggas see flashes of light
When you trapped up in the heights but clappers aimin at the wife

Yeah, dudes gettin money is still thuggin
Chicks gettin money is still ghetto
Still livin the whole thuggish stilleto
Your team let the metal burst before you take an L
You raised in hell, let the dust settle first
Then you ask the question, snatchin the life of the innocent
Shit happens huh, a man's respected by his actions
It's the karma of the street, you try to meet the karma
While the karma sleep, yo it's deep, but the karma can't be beat
You don't know your enemy, so you fightin with yourself
Relate to rap niggas cause they writin what you felt
You got top shelf connects you gettin seasoned like a veteran
We suck the venom out the snake bite, without the medicine
We benefit from niggas in tenements, dyin for benjamins
So bad that they know they own coffin measurements
Ghetto eloquence, in the moment of truth, don't be hesistant
Or fall victim to the element, word is bond

Just another chapter of the night, in the ghetto afterlife
Where you just seen or heard about or gonna have to fight
Where they sacrifice the life and niggas see flashes of light
When you trapped up in the heights but clappers aimin at the wife

Niggas get caught up in the struggle
End up in court in trouble, sportin a bubble
Ford azure bubble, importer smuggle, forcin a rumble
Hit the blocks with a portion to double
Flip and get tossed in the huddle
Police with one piece short of the puzzle
It's a hustle, peep the street life, they movin muscle
And the G's'll make your knees buckle
Tussle with heat until your feet stand in a pee puddle
Cheese double but all the speedy niggas bleed puddles
Make the headlines; some try to escape the fed time
Phone taps on direct lines - tec-9's with the red shine
Jake climbin through the bedroom blinds
Tryin to bring you to your deadline, it's slippery when wet signs
Red time, wipe the sweat around your neck time
One shot spill out your red wine, rock shots to deafen your prime
Pieces of hot lead left in your mind
One slug to the left of your spine
Forever late to rest on the shrine",Ghetto Afterlife,2000

Still came down on the furl and pumped hero

While you niggas pay tax
Now how ghetto is this
you can catch me in your hallway taking a piss
One hand on my dick one hand on a spliff
Burnt lips from the roach clip, yellow tips

Stickers hate I never leave a bread to trace
Only evidence I leave is hickies on chicks' face
In the corner with the crooked niggas
But yo shit's straight
We start war to leave with these seven revolvers
Sell case never test the floor
Sticky yank slicking enough why'all
I'm a man enough to put on a dress
To creep up like grand-moma and bust why'all
Get close enough to part your vest and tux off

Watching niggas die with my hand on their doe
Singing with the bass

Choking on your own words
Should have watched the ground when you spoke
One last final approach
Make your whole family ghost
Bust bottles of cham and and we toast
Till your photo stamped in the post

Armenians so I resort the evil thoughts like Damien
This flame of fury to the D-A and the jury 
A hundred grand the judges hammer slams I'm a free man.

What would you do if you could do the unbelievable
Once you rule the world every girl would want to be with you
First ya get the money then you get the power
Big Pun's the same son bustin' my guns for the Dollars

Yo, I'm walkin' waters
Spit fire and shit Häagen-Dazs
Idolize no man like Conan and stand beside the guards
Be larger than life, twice as nice as ya idol
Pump you with pride, then guide you str8 to hell like the bible
I'm lible to start manipulatin' minds infiltratin' clown
'm out the pitfalls of life entice with nickle plated nine
It seems every time I'm dream I'm in a nightmare of fiend
Livin' a world of mothers and queens and men would fight fare 
(Hell Yea!) I wish I could, I wish I could
Never forget this whole damn world ain't shit I'm just a hood
Yo I change my life make my wife and get the chance for the pain
And physical abuse, give her back her best years
Grab my chest hairs, pound my fist on the hard cement
Spark the scent, and cloud the sky till my heart's content
Repent and vow she be forgiven 
How could we be proud to live in a world 
Which condemns man, child, to women

[The L.O.X.]
Yo, yo, yo, yo, yo
You know we still in the hood dog, in front of the store
With the work across the street and the gun in the stall
Soon as somethin happen niggaz want to run to the law
You know the code of the streets, never run to the law
That's why I can't even run 'less I run with a four
or I walk with a three, come and talk to 'em P
You can catch me down bottom with a bird and a glock
On the block makin money where they murder a lot
Or you can catch me up top shootin dice for a yard
I'm talkin six digits, niggaz bet the house or the car
You can catch me hittin the spliff, sick in the pit
On the fiend like I'm missin my shit, they think I'm crazy
Catch me hittin your lady in my Mercedes
Bird on your baby, fuck you I'm keepin it gravy

[Beanie Sigel]
Aiyyo, I've been kickin murder - since Adidas with thick strings
T.I. sweatsuits, Pumas with thick chains
Four finger rings, black belts with brass names
I was spittin flames since niggaz was pitchin change
I'm a hard knock kiddo, always played the middle
Threw flacks in the crack game, getchu if I can getchu
Since a buck, played the highway, dodgin the troop boys
Jumpin in and out of Coupes, wavin for Duke boys
Always chased a penny, copped quarter waters
Tried to make a dollar chased my pop's boss daughters
Tryin to make my name, global, in all four corners
Philly baller, gamin in all four quarters
Never worked, never will - all my hoes buy my clothes
I can't go broke, never will - all my bros buy my O's
I'm the best thing that linked up with New York since Sprewell
I murder, nuttin further - fill in the details

[Brett]
I'm here, it's over, fuck how why'all feel
When I drop, why'all gon' realize it's all real
Bein left for dead, tied up, smoke 'til I was dried up
So high up, seem like the sky ducked, high what?
Life was rough, but now it's nothin to hide
Used to click and be quick to put this gun to yo' side
Be like, ""That chain nice - I like that pal.
Matter fact {*click click*} I'd like that now.""
You've got game? Call the name, just spell the name right
Brett, one of the best rappers ever to touch a mic
It's prophecized I'd write, spit scriptures mind blowin
'til my coffin top close and heaven skies open
Fear no man's my slogan, I hope why'all believe
I'm just like you, fear nuttin human that bleeds
My mind breed two movies, six ab-lums, a hundred poems
Thirty R&B joints, I'm beyond the norm, why'all just mad
I'm just glad, got my time to shine

It's B.G.S. kid so what you facin? Caps racin
Decapitation twenty buck-fifties and lacerations
Guerilla fam' camouflaged out in the grass waitin
to blass your nation slash like Jason and bash your face in
We ass lacin top bodies and half in the basement
Our style, cast you so bad you'll need plastic replacement
When gats is raised in, fascination blastin and blazin
Evacuation for your whole staff there's gas in the tank and
Gets back abrasions from cap grazin, defy gravitation
Pull my shit back squeeze bust it like masturbation
Hold fort, hold the blow torch, leave your soul scorched
with no remorse, the state of New York, get your shit caught
When niggaz hawk, let the fifth talk
So tell me who's the next man to flip?
I stop the beef shit, with rubber handled grips

Kool G Rap,"It's a demo

People in the audience Kool G Rap is my name
I write rhymes and insert them inside your brain
And DJ Polo, the man I'm behind
He operates the turntables when I'm rocking my rhymes, see

It's a demo

Psychopath on the phonograph, nut of the cuts
You heard the boy slice, is he nice or what?
He's the main entertainer inside the show
And he goes by the name of DJ Polo, see

It's a demo

I supply the data, he's the wheel operator
We're walking tall and we're called The Terminators
I'm Kool G Rap, and he's Polo
He cuts like a pro when I go solo
He's a record spinner winner, that you can bet
Eats DJ's for dinner on his table set
With cuts he concocts and the party rocks
DJ's want to Xerox it out the box
A professional performer, wheels of steel trainer
One hundred percent excellent entertainer
The maker and creator of the lyrical line
Idea of Shakespeare, the mind of Einstein
Surrender, pretender, you don't exist
As a vocalist, so you can kiss this
I'm Kool G Rap, greatest of all times
And you can see it, inside my rhymes
See it's a demo

It's a demo

My recital will form a musical brainstorm
Powerful sound waves where ear drums are torn
The performer recites, competitors ignite
Audiences tonight I came to incite
Fascinating results, a defeat will be difficult
Equivalent to a thousand volts
To my brief rap speech you attach like a leech
Examine when I'm jamming and when I preach
Before I'm completed, you will all be deleted
You said I sucked, instead I succeeded
Fan fascinator, I supply data
According to the groove, I'm a real smooth operator
I activate a musical device
Dialogues are concise, no need to splice
My system contains musical rap rain
Instrumentals inserted inside your brain
All levels rate low with a medium tempo
I give a dramatical cameo show
And now you know DJ Polo
These party people are ready to go
See it's a demo

It's a demo

Better than a Snicker when it comes to a snack
I go solo with Polo when I'm in combat
I'm the MC humanoid and I just get annoyed
Boy you'll be destroyed cause you copy like a Polaroid
Coming like a meteor inside any area
Make the people merrier, vicious like a terrier
Like a terrorist, I will terrorize
Telling any territory I'm a glory enterprise
The microphone fanatic, cause I'm the Asiatic
Brotherman from the motherland, rappers automatic
Ly suffer as I suffocate, then I start to alienate
Make you an inmate, so you cannot retaliate
Mutilate at a rate to penetrate you
No other crew can rescue
My talents are balanced my audience is silent
MC's stop biting or I'll get violent
It's a demo

It's a demo

I take a scene to the extreme
To the climax and those who sleep will have a wet dream
So don't even quote what you write is dolt
Your rhymes are small-time through a microscope
More cooler than an Ice Ages
Biters, let the effective students walk through my white pages
Different stages of rage that I'm going through
And like an owl, you'll know who to
Feed your greed, you want and need
The rhymes that you carefully read, but your eyes bleed
Cause my fury is scary
And if you bite, you'll be leaving all your teeth for the Tooth Fairy
Go ahead and dare me, if you think I'm joking or playing
When you're feeling what I'm saying, you'll be kneeling and praying
Then I release steam like a radiator
And attack MC's like a gladiator
As my talent proceeds to grow, yo
This ain't the end of the show, it's a demo

 Not to mention I'm winner of Mack Daddy conventions 
 I get a lot of attention 
 Sleepin in sheets that's made of satin 
 with one of my money makin honies she's mixed Spanish and Latin 
 She's a fly type of swinger 
 Twenty carats on her fingers, minks on every coat hanger 
 In a highrise, made for only fly guys 
 With a size that attracts the ladies eyes 
 Keepin the stash and the cash flow 
 Profile's kept low, more dough than Barry Manilow 
 Fly cars, I got diamonds in jelly jars 
 To earn respect, collectin bar fight scars 
 Slick talkin with a chick when I'm walkin 
 Midnight stalkin, all the suckers be hawkin 
 And I max while you be waxin your Cadillacs 
 Smooth as a fax, but I can cut you like an axe 
 Big spender, cause I'm a winner like Bruce Jenner 
 I burn all beginners and let em simmer like a TV dinner 
 On the phone cause I'm hard like stone 
 Holdin my own, cause I'm bad to the bone 
 I'm gettin cash and, ladies receive my passion 
 Parties I'm crashin with a flashy type of action 
 On stage, I kick outrageous 
 And I enslave the bravest, more diamonds than Sammy Davis 
 I'm more dramatic than _Dallas_ is 
 More pretty than a palace is, hands no callouses 
 Give me a clever girl and I'll outfox her 
 The man that rocks her in pure silk boxers 
 So what you want honey a chump or a champ? 
 Visa or food stamps, Latins or lamps? 
 I run the game like Sega 
 Go to war like Noreaga, hit like Schawrzaneggar 
 Excitin when I'm fightin I'm frightenin 
 Stick chicks slick in quick like greased lightning 
 Ladies I'll love you all tomorrow like Annie 
 And I bet you'll all leave with wet panties 
 Cause I can make a eighty yard dash come back fast 
 Wrap rappers all up in the back, like a jackass 
 Police want to harass me 
 Cause I got all the material that has me lookin jazzy

 Pockets so fat, I flat em down with a dough roller 
 Dead zone when I strike the microphone 
 G. Rap's known, cause I'm bad to the bone 
 I never needed a helpin handin 
 I'm outstandin, type of guy, girls never abandon 
 And when I'm rollin with force, three across your belly 
 Knockin suckers out the box like I'm playin skelly 
 Cause I pull out the .45 if you offend me 
 And leave the barrel of it smokin like a chimney 
 Rhymes are dynamic, voice is titanic 
 Gigantic, suckers get frantic and then panic 
 A smooth talker, cause I'm a Queens New Yorker 
 My rhymes bring more Good Times than Jimmie Walker 
 A bumrusher, cause I'm a crusher of hardrocks 
 When I turn thirty, I'll still be dirty as Redd Foxx 
 Try to cope, what I wrote, get a sore throat 
 My lyrical notes float like sailboats 
 I keep it steady for the petty sucker rappers I'll be ready 
 I got more bodies than Frank Netti 
 Battles I win em cause I send em to hell when I begin em 
 Because I put it in em like a venom 
 Discover the toughest rap brother you ever seen 
 Not a fairy, but milky like the Dairy Queen 
 Movin around like a smooth choreographer 
 Posin my hoes in all clothes for the photographer

Kool G Rap,"He's the big boss when his hands criss cross
Up and down the crossfader turning wax to sauce
It ain't a hip hop record that he can't chop
Polo show them how it's done in the butcher shop

The rhythm he brings makes the audience swing
While the plates rotates his fingers cling
To the records on felts, your earwax melts
Scratching so hard that he breaks the belts
DJs relax, kneecaps collapse
My rap perhaps is like a booby trap
Polo the big boar, I'm the warrior of metaphor
Fully equipped manipulating my competitor
And I remain just like a stain
As long as I maintain my brainiac brain
Rap words rehearsed since first grade
My utensil is the pencil and his is a blade
The man at the top of the needle drop
Polo let's have some fun, show them how it's done
Treat them like your son, in the butcher shop

DJs he's disputed you should be saluted
The man gives a cut with scratches included
I'm cool G Rap, he's my DJ
This is a mortal combat of the Polo play
Cuts like a scissor, rips like a razor
The sound penetrates elements like a laser
The beat connects to my dialect
New Technic turntables, the party I wreck
Motivation to blend, the rotation begins
They reported his fins on 1010 West
And his name is Polo the phonograph is for bolo
I go solo, to battle cool G Rap is no-no, bozo
Your style is so-so, equal to disco
Swing and some go-go, and on to calypso
So biters and reciters, don't mean to offend you
Yes I will continue but I'm not a menu
So don't bite or swallow or fight or follow
Recite or borrow rhymes and want to give them back tomorrow
Polo is like Zorro, war hero
Horror, terror, errors: zero
The alert concert network expert
He'll wreck dissect inject insert
Cuts, til your eardrums pop
Polo show them how it's done in the butcher shop

I'm a walking dictionary, an encyclopedia
Rapper with data, the best in the media
Or area, so prepare for your burial
On your radio, pull out your aerial
Or antenna cause this one is a winner
Not a sinner, or an MC beginner
Cool G Rap is just me not he or she or we
Or any other MC
So please, I'm single and not plural
I'm totally high moral, excellent with the oral

Nothin comin soft 'cause I'll never throw weaker blows 
I'll kick you in your [ass] and your breath'll smell like sneaker soles 
Now how's that for a fixin'? 
You'd better rather go to Roy's, cause I ain't kickin' science fiction 
I kick a size nine sneaker or boot 
Chop chumps to stumps, and they remain minute 
The Sheik, I get deep, and always leave with the wet meat 
Because of my technique, I'm the one you let speak 
I collect crops and props like spinach 
I'm vintage, your single sums up to a ten inch 
My soul brother Van Paul and Pete Rock 
Keep the funk flowin' until the last beat stops 
The soul man, can't have you leavin' on a stretcher 
Probably, have you leavin in leather, I catch a body 
From wreckin' slum rappers, but to be frank 
I don't give a [fuck] I got money in the bank

When you're sittin' by your radio, screamin', ""Freddie Foxxx goes next"" 
Those beholdin' the words of a master 
Find mental disaster, as I kick it faster 
Whoever opposes me, and what I feel 
Might find their legs bein' replaced by steel 
This is a brand new year, and the penalty is death 
So there won't be a lot of suckers left 
I grab the mic, and I load it like a long four-fifth 
Huh, and dare you to riff 
Or even sneeze as I blow you to your knees, have you curled up 
In a corner like a dog, with hoof in mouth disease 
Spittin' razor blades, cuttin' veins you can't stitch 
I got you screamin like a [bitch] 
I took your microphone, you can't get it back 
Because your rap was wack 
I'm comin' fifty strong in an armored tank 
And takin' money to the bank

To my opponents, let me just demonstrate for a minute 
Crooks gettin' hooked, to my book, just like an addiction 
Stop your diction you drop, the science fiction 
Let's get specific you can't get with it 
I'm too terrific and scientific, forget it 
Don't even try to limp it, you're not ready to make hits 
You still got a learner's permit 
Poppin' that [shit], you better sit 
Here's a word, of a third degree burn, so listen and learn 
You're missin' a turn, so you better get, concerned 
My challenger, check the calendar 
I'm as live as a .45 caliber, Colt 
With a silencer, wettin' up, suckers I be settin' up 
Button up, while I'm cuttin' up, never lettin' up 
I don't link up, with suckers with raps that shrank 
Thanks sonny, I'm takin' money to the bank

One in the chamber, eight in the clip 
Pull out a razor, watch your rhyme book rip 
It's Ant Live, liver and deliveries get liver 
With G. Rap, and we're the sole survivors

Too much, caught in the ropes, like double dutch

Cause like a whorehouse shippin' out [pussy] tonight 
Believe me I ain't goin' out like a brick parachute 
Or a fruit, or a guy that wears Brut 
Cologne, I'm violent prone, so leave me alone

Kool G Rap,"This is poison so be alert and cautious
Those who act courageous you will get nauseous
Infected or contaminated
Turn on your stereo never come radio-activated
Deadly and fatal, poison the title
My recital hits the parts that are vital
So tune in the tone of beats and poems
Polo's headphones becomes a skull and crossbones
Pull out your Q-tips, clean out the earwax
If you're still hard of hearing
I'mma scrub them with Ajax
With maximum drum so behave and remember
You're a slave to my sound wave
Faster rhymes I mastermind I have to find
A new method time after time
Write a rhyme quick when I pull out my Bic pen
Stick to an idea, the soundproof slick then
Put it on paper cause I make you hyper
Than any other rapper cause I keep my rapping riper
Like cherries or some say berries
Mandatory for the auditorium's glory
Here's the story: rappers getting leery to hear me
G speaks in a new technique of fury
Combination of drums and noise and
Yo yo yo Polo yo this is poison

Poison!

Look-alikes on the mic you should get off
You're a rip-off, I'mma rip up, get
Rid of, cause you bit off
Bite off, ate off. Imitate off
They get paid off for G Rap to get laid off
Get up and sit up the butterer and buttercup
Male or female shut them up, Polo shut her up

Yo, you heard what he said shut the hell up, man

Yeah, hide my line as you pick them up
Rob me blind of my rhymes you might as
Well have said: ""stick 'em up.""
Letters of metaphor matters to
Better the fatter your pocket
Rhymes blast off like rockets
Rhymes will be replaced and beats erased
In case a rapper tries to trace hardcore bass
Made in a minute the sky is the limit
For reaching the goal and the dream
Wouldn't you want to be in it to win it?
Biters are wanted like animals hunted
Soon as I get them I hit them I done it
To the suckers who fronted
The rappers who made it and did it
Forget about winning the battle cause
I'mma shake rattle and roll
A little something for girls and boys and
Yo yo Polo my man yo this is poison

Read the label sucker
P-O-I-S-O-N yeah, Poison

Poison!

A mind designed to find a rhyme that's right on time
One step beyond and not behind the line
That separates dogs from divine
Take it as a caution, or a warning sign
Whether antonyms, words I'm blending them
Homonyms, synonyms, good like M&M's
With Polo and while he's slicing
I'll turn the mike's last name into Tyson
My brain is like a factory constantly creating
Material stitch by stitch for decoration
Lyrics are fabrics, beat is the lining
My passion in rhyming is fashion designing
Now it gets odd it, cause people want to sport it
You bought it, if you didn't then you couldn't afford it
Poetry full of surprises, it's like a game show
And my brain glows just like a rainbow
Rappers and poets they already know it
G Rap is a terror not a error and never
Will I stop reaching for better
Whether wheels of steel or reel to reel
G Rap will make you feel the real deal
I usually rap hardcore and I know
That y'all thinking am I somehow semi, so
We yell ""party"" and girls and boys and

Kool G Rap,"[Verse One:] 
 When I was five years old I realized there was a road 
 At the end I will win lots of pots of gold 
 Never took a break never made a mistake 
 Took time to create 'cause there's money to make 
 To be a billionaire takes hard work for years 
 Some nights I sheded tears while I sent up prayers 
 Been through hard times even worked part time 
 In a seafood store sweepin floors for dimes 
 I was sort of a porter takin the next man's order 
 Breakin my back for ?a shack for headquarters? 
 All my manpower for four bucks an hour 
 Took the time, I wrote rhymes in the shower 
 Shoes are scoffed 'cause the road gets rough 
 But I'ma rock it til my pockets ain't stuffed enough 
 All the freaks wouldn't speak 'cause my checks was weak 
 They would turn the other cheek so I started to seek 
 A way to get a play, and maybe one day 
 I'll be performin up a storm for a decent pay 
 No matter how it seems I always kept the dream 
 All the girlies scream and suckas get creamed 
 Dreamed about it for five years straight 
 Finally I got a break and cut my first plate 
 The road ain't yellow and there ain't no witches 
 My name is cool G Rap, I'm on the road to the riches 
 
[Verse Two:] 
 I used to stand on the block sellin cooked up rock 
 Money bustin out my sock 'cause I really would clock 
 They were for kind of fiends bringin jackets and jeans 
 Magazines, anything, just to hustle for beans 
 The cash was comin fast, money grew like grass 
 People hungry for the blast that don't even last 
 Didn't want to be involved but the money will getcha 
 Gettin richer and richer, the police took my picture 
 But I still supplied, some people I knew died 
 Murders and homicides for bottles of suicide 
 Money, jewelry, livin like a star 
 And I wasn't too far from a Jaguar car 
 In a small-time casino, the town's Al Pacino 
 For all of the girls, the pretty boy Valentino 
 I shot up stores and I kicked down doors 
 Collecting scars from little neighborhood wars 
 Many legs I broke, many necks I choked 
 And if provoked I let the pistol smoke 
 Loyal members in a crew now down with the game 
 Sellin nickels and dimes, sunshine or rain 
 What I had was bad from my shoes to my pad 
 In the first time in my life loanin money to dad 
 Now the table's turned and my lifestyle switches 
 My name is cool G Rap, I'm on the road to the riches 
 
 [Verse Three:] 
 A thug a-mugs? for drugs, he eventually bugs 
 Lookin for crack on carpets and rugs 
 The squealers tells? but the dealer still sells 
 Little spoiled kids inheritin oil wells 
 I was the type on the opposite side 
 Of smokin the pipe, in a beef I got hype 
 'cause rags to riches switches men to witches 
 Become stitches, body bags in ditches 
 Bloodshed, I painted the town red 
 People fled as I put a dread's head to bed 
 That mean's dead, in other words deceased 
 Face got erased, bullets got released 
 Bombs were planted, the kids were kidnapped 
 In fact that was a way to get back 
 At enemies who tried to clock G's 
 on my block, now they forever knock Z's 
 Plans of rampages went for ages 
 Some got knocked and locked inside cages 
 Some bit the dust for crumbs and crusts 
 In God We Trust, now rots to rust 
 Plus caps to cops, policeman drops 
 You blew off his top when the pistol went pop 
 Troopers, soldiers, rollin like boulders 
 Eyes of hate and their hearts get colder 
 Some young male put in jail 
 His lawyer so good his bail is on sale 
 Lookin at the hourglass, how long can this power last? 
 Longer than my song but he already fell 
 He likes to eat hardy, party 
 Be like John Gotti, and drive a Maserati 
 Rough in the ghetto, but in jail he's Jello 
 Mellow, yellow fellow, tell or hell, hello 
 One court date can turn an outlaw to an inmate 
 But just stay, ship him upstate by the Great Lakes 
 And than a-wait and wait and wait 
 Til he breaks, that's all it takes 
 So he fakes to be a man, but he can't stand 
 On his own two feet because now he's in a new land 
 Rules are different and so is life 
 When you think with a shank, talk with a knife 
 Not my lifestyle so I made a you-turn 
 More money I earn, more money to burn 
 Pushin all buttons, pullin all switches

They waited until the blocks got hot 
And got raided by the cops
I'll explain the man sleeping in the rain
His whole life remains inside a bottle of Night Train
Another man got his clothes in a sack
Cause he spent every dime of his rent playing blackjack
And there's the poor little sister
She has a little baby daughter
Named Sonya and Sonya has pneumonia
So why's her mother in a club unzipped though?
Yo that's her job, Sonya's mommy is a bar stripper
Drug dealers drive around looking hard
Knowing they're sending their brothers and sisters to the graveyard
Every day is a main event, some old lady limps
The pushers and pimps eat shrimps
It gets tiring, the sight of a gun firing
They must desire for the sound of a siren
A bag lady dies in an alleyway
She's seen the last of her days inside the subways
More and more down the slope, the kid couldn't cope
So he stole somebody's dope and a gold rope
Now my son's on the run, he's a wanted one
Had fun then was done by a shotgun
Upstairs I cover my ears and tears
The man downstairs must have drank too many beers
Cause every day of his life he beats his wife
Till one night she decides to pull a butcher knife
Blind man plays the sax
A tune called ?The Arms on My Moms Show Railroad Tracks?
Many lives are cut short
That's when you're living
In the streets of New York

Baby needs new shoes
But his papa uses all the money for booze
A young girl is undressed in the back seat of a Caddy
Calling some man Daddy
Three men slain inside an apartment
All you could see was the sparks when it darkened
Daylight broke, cops roll on the scene
The drug war, daily routine
Gambling spots, just a poor man's jackpot
You winning a lot, you get shot
The drug dealing fanatics
But you don't want no static
Cause they got crack addicts with automatics
Shoot-outs for a desire for territory
A kid got caught in the crossfire
A tired mother can't take no more
She grab the bottle full of sleeping pills and took about 24
Human beings are laying on the pavement
Cause they're a part of a mental enslavement
The cop snipers, little babies in dirty diapers
This type of life is making you hyper
People scouting a torched-out building
And got killed when the cold air filled in
Is hell really suggested?
No more persons arrested, a child molested
A little kid says
""Yo I got a color TV, CD player and car stereo
And all I want is a castle
I also got a .38, don't give me no hassle""
One kid heads straight for the top
And gets stopped and popped by a crooked cop
Look behind you when you walk
That's how it is in the streets of New York",Streets of New York,2002

Kool G Rap,"Yeah here we go, just go with the flow
I wanna say something to this girl I know
She tried to play me out though, check it out

This I dedicate to the girl I hate
It's a piece of my mind rhyme put on a plate
So yo, go ahead swinger, I'm putting up my middle finger
I'm not sad or mad, I don't feel anger
You're not all that fly, trying to play the role
I had girls that looked better on the ho stroll
Working night patrol, ya know what I mean?
I get cash and still wear Jordache jeans
You thought your drug-dealing man was much better
Because he always came and got you in a plush Jetta
Or a Audi, a Benz, or a Jaguar
You didn't think G Rap was going that far
I'm here to tell off, because you thought I fell off
And now if you're riding the tip, just get the hell off
You wanted to leave because you didn't believe that I would achieve
Cause you had something up your sleeve
Perhaps you might have thought I'm a dreamer with a fat head
Now you're stuck with a baby from a crack head
Come to my shows, you want to check it to see if I wreck it
The only record your man got is a jail record
I know you like him a lot because he's a big shot
The only picture you got is his mug shot
I'm on a label with well-known singers in it
Look, your man's getting booked and fingerprinted
Polo drives a Benz from state to stae
By the way, guess who made his license plates
Thought I was finished, down, going through the blues
Here's a hundred dollars, go buy some new shoes
Go ahead good looking, you can keep booking
From my recital I'll never get my title tooken
So you got a little 9 to 5, so what?
What do you do for a living, slice cold cuts?
You look slick, but you know every Tom and Dick
You're more quick than a chick from a porno flick
While you scrub floors, I go on tours
From me, G Rap, yo, truly yours

(Yo G man! You should diss her man. Yo I heard he's a homo anyway)

Listen up money, or should I say honey?
You're looking more sweeter than a Playboy bunny
Fingernails filed, your hair is styled
And the gear that you wear looks hot and wild
Everybody says is he, some kind of sissy?
Your name was ""Moose"" but now they call you ""Missy""
Night or day lights, you fight for the gay rights
I thought you would stay bright, but you wanna play fight
With men, and Len, your real close friend
But you wouldn't be his friend if his knees didn't bend
You're not a lady dear, you're a square and a queer
Barrettes in your hair, bamboos in your ear
Running to cars, hanging out in gay bars
Winking your eyes to guys that wear bras
Skintight Levi's and even knee-highs
Don't try to lie, sugar, I know why
In the ladies bathroom, spraying on perfume
Stuffing your t-shirt with two balloons
You don't think about the opposite sex at all
Instead of sugar walls, you'd rather have the balls
Way back in the days, you was as big as a cow
But look at you now, at jams you say ""Ow!""
A sex disease was as common as TB
But gays today get VD in 3-D
And that is called AIDS in case you didn't know
And the only blow I'm giving is this knockout blow
Switching with your bandana looking like Diana Ross
From me G Rap, yo, truly yours

(Hey yo, finish dissing that girl, man)

Yo, do me a favor, and pick up a pen and pad
And try to write down the numbers of the men you've had
So remember when you're putting someone else in check
Go to the Wizard of Oz and get some self-respect
Won't say no names, it might leave a permanent scar
I don't have to go that far, you know who you are
And if you don't, then everybody else does
Cause all the fellas be telling me how good you was
I can't accept a girl with a ruined rep
I'm like a chef, I just cook up the stew and step
Off with her clothes, like Moby Dick, there she blows
She wanna throw like the girls from the peep shows
Your man was large, but now he's getting kinda tiny
And you run up behind me trying to get pregnant by me
And in a year, I bet you'll be on welfare
Don't cry for help dear, you put yourself there
The way it looks, you'll end up in Playboy books
While your man is in Manhattan snatching pocket books
Bugging and mugging with a big 12 gauge
Starving so bad I can see his ribcage
Yo, you used to tell me all the time you're gonna be a model
Later in life, you're living in a crack bottle
So when you're begging on your knees because I'm clocking G's
You'll be in zero degrees getting processed cheese
Wearing dungarees, yo baby I don't need a girl with broken hands
Cause her man's a woman beater
So when you getting sores from giving up your drawers
Remember Kool G Rap said truly yours

Yo, I don't even know why you tried to play me honey

Kool G Rap,"She tossed the flamer '94 walked into danger
Behind the wall fought with a banger
Trapped in the beast, gas released, a rat deceased
Back on the street, back on her feet
Clappin' the heat

She's dressed to kill
Iced-out head to toe, a snake in black
She's cleared, to, get ill
She's about the dough, the black widow

Yo, she was a tight bird, female version of Iceberg
To put in the right words
Played the right curves, beige and white birds
The type she served it was quite superb
Ran through the city in a white suburb
Lived in a predominantly white suburb
She liked the herb, rockin' all the richest type of furs
Make your life submerge if you strike a nerve
Dough she like to splurge
Shine of her light blurs from off her finger
Honey was off the ringer, the way she tossed the flamer
'94 walked into danger, behind the wall fought with a banger
Trapped in the beast, gas released, a rat deceased
Back to the street, back on her feet
Clappin' the heat, from the back seat, in back of a jeep
Stackin' the heat, pilin' the ones
Made her point when violence was brung
Regulated and balanced the slums
Brought in a cat with a talent for guns
Click quick to silence a Dunn
Convoys of black limos
Employs strapped with mack millos
Bustin' off caps through a cracked window, that's the MO
Push your wig back, make you a black Leno
The feds on her tracks got the phones tapped for info
Tryin' to map the dividend flow, and where the ends go
Checkin' on whose name the Benz go
Who pushes the buttons when Mac-10's blow
A rose on a black satin pillow
The silhouette of her web, killin' for blood spill, a black widow

[Chorus]
She's (out for blood) dressed (for the kill) to kill (bustin' slugs)
Iced-out (shit is real) head (livin' crime) to toe (life of crime)
A snake (droppin' heads) in black (pullin' nines)
She's cleared (dodgin' heat) to (play the street)
Get ill (let the guns blow, had to eat)
She's about (copped the raw) the dough (went to war)
The black widow (beef no more, cold fours at your door)

She was married but four times a widow
The fifth time ditto, kiddo
Step out of line, kitko, she spit nines and shi-dells
Put a pound to the tip of your niddose
Put em in line piddles
Diamond-stud shinin' the clito', the web spinnin'
With bloodstains soaked in the bed linen
Spread venom, known for bustin' the lead grinnin', tilted red brimmin'
Makin' the lights inside of your head dimmin'
Givin' head to men and, leave a knife in they chest with a red ribbon
Bread to swim in, foes get left deader than Lennon
Threads of linen, sippin' gin with a shread of lemon
Dead-up thoroughbred, slim and trim and stackin cake like Emminger's
Under the down coat brown coat like cinnamon
She went to have the Benjamins, for that she injure men
Send a squad to go and injure men that injure men
On top of that she popular, hit the opera
Francis Ford Coppola, mezzanine she's with binoculars
You even think about poppin' her, stoppin' her, moppin' her, droppin' her
Hard with bodyguards divin' on top of her
Cops in they Blu-Blockers watchin' her, steady clockin her
Jock her, dreamin' of knockin' her, thinkin' a scheme for knockin' her
Dress provocative, show the cleavage between her knockers
Bust a sock off with a blocker to rasta inside her locker
She cover the bills though, restaurant delicatessen Armadillo
White Willow, strike of the black widow

[Chorus]

She held a white weddin'
Type settin' just like a sight from heaven
Spend twice the bread'n from her last rice on her head'n
All types of presents, striking presence
Bodyguards ready to light they weapons, ignite the Wessons
Refuse to live the life of a peasant
Days and nights was right and type pleasant
At the foot of the aisles, took vows
With all the criminals and crook pals
That put smiles on niggaz' necks while they look foul
Piles of cops peepin' her central book files
Beef them niggaz cook wild, groom lookin shook style
Forced into marriage, horse and a carriage
Remember lifespan shorter than average, lady boss flossin her carats
Dreams to get rich and perish in Paris
Cherish the cabbagem, makin' her path out of the church passage
Thugs they do they dirt massive
Skirt slashed, first class, Doni Amberg glasses
Flirt with her lashes
Snapshots, smirk for the flashes
Plots to leave her murked in the masses
Two killin' experts on the grasses
Put in they Tec work for the cashes
Leave the Earth hurt with a passion
Two louds shots burstin' in action
Made her head jerk from the blastin
Lady down, holdin' her shirt gaspin', hit by another turf assassin
Reason not even worth askin; the facts are real, though
Got her cap peeled for stackin' real dough

Not blaze like half of your block in broad daylight
Take flight to Queens with your fake ice
Pull you out the back of the trunk
And put your face in the brake light
You six deep, so what? Me I'm by myself
But you know what? I cut one of y'all real bad
Pops is my pops but my moms my real dad
You runnin' round with the same heart that Steel had
I'm the best, I don't give a fuck who said so
Have you dope fiend like Lazy, let go
Don't get your head gassed off my nice chain, word to my mother
I done lost half your life in a dice game
I don't brag shit, I'm a hustler; I don't wanna be seen
I want the green the fame shit is for suckers
I'm a Guerilla, so it ain't nuttin' to touch ya
Bitch nigga recognize that or learn to suffer

Only the good soldiers die young
To stay alive up in these streets you gotsta fly one
Fore the flamers make you famous aimin to ply one
Niggaz is dyin' over pie crumbs, the live ones
(Only the good die young)
Only the good soldiers die young
Over chips they'll leave you drippin witcha side numb
Come out the fort with your torches up and ride Dunn
No one survives with a shy gun inside slums
(Only the good die young)

The bullies are back
Gettin' the news that's tragic, feuds are graphic
Moves through the traffic
Break any rules you lose your attic
Who's in the habit of usin' the static
Make somethin' ooze out your cabbage
When dudes with ratchets, can pay your dues
Stools on the mattress, bruised and battered
Blown out your shoes and your fabrics
With Jakes searchin' for clues and maggots
My crew is savage, we carry no dead weight
Bet they hide you when I slide kid
All my tools is packaged, and lose you faggots
Stay coppin' them jewels with karats, so who's the rabbit
Trix are for kids, in the buggy eye six on the strip
Strictly for big wigs, so tell me what this is
A nigga that's bout his biz, a nigga that don't forgive
A nigga that don't renege, a nigga that bust a cig, rupture your ribs
Front and I'll bring it to you 'xactly where you live
BGF surround the crib, throw a pound to the kid
Hit a fry when the good die young

Yo it's a whole city of animals
Cannibals, bloodthirsty niggaz that hammer you
And handle you, shots makin you flammable
That's what an evil man's plan'll do
Vandal you, candle you, dismantle you
Leavin' your fam and crew, pan a few blocks
Bodies in camera view, for a grand or two
Land you on channel two
When niggaz can't eat, that's what the fam'll do
Leave you for the mantle, examine you
For the van to come transfer you
Too late to bandage you, too much damage to you
The coroners know how to manage you
Down in they land they planted you
That's what the cannons do, forever branded you
Spare cannoned you, abandoned you, rock you to sleep
Niggaz surrounded you, death wish granted you, fan at you
Went to my hundred shot clip when they flip and throw a grand at you
Peel your shit open like a can of brew
Then they work from the mandible, havin' you livin' where the salmon do
The good die young, redrum, who left to take a stand for you

[Chorus]

You cock a hot bet (?) and catch a popped vessel
And shot vestibule; you got testicles
Beef bring a nigga get shot visible
Rock with the best of you; then it's back to the block
The blacktops we open up shop and clock decimals
Fake cops, scrape from the teeth hot for residue
The foul slang liver(?) page, reach for that shit on your waist
Every killer in the place get hit in the face
Turn around, simmer down nigga, get in the safe
What you fear when the shots is blowin; shed a tear for the one
that caught one under the ear inside of his top popped open
It's death for all niggaz that left with the glock smokin
Came in with hot toast and left the whole spot soakin'
Fuck y'all niggaz not knowin', we make your seeds stop growin'
Guerilla nigga, we keep rhymes flowin'
Bust a four pound, man down, found in the lot swollen
Drama brung, all inside the slum, the good die young

We mob in it, fake niggaz dissolve in minutes
It's codes to it, real killers they know music
Even hoes on the low at the shows lose it
Courvoisier-sippin, this slim nigga stay flippin
My ways different, duck when the AK spittin
It's more to it, verbal wisely, all fluent
In real life this is how the dogs do it

Found from bloodhound nasals
Or deep in the river get found naval

""American Me"" style, knife in the anal; who 'round to save you?
I leave you from waist down disabled
Face split like a round bagel
Found in a hospital gown witcha crown stapled
Wrong one to tangle with, a gym star, spangle your shit
Use your handkerchief to strangle your bitch
Single niggaz out on the strip and bang in a clip
Slugs from a Desert Eagle mingle the click
A force of habit, for me to let it rip across your attic
Never violent with a silent but I toss your cabbage

Broke niggas bum out
Jakes holdin' they gun out
When back streets are taped up
Bodies laying faced up
Cats running with ace up
The spots get 'em paced up
The street lamps are broke now
Mad bitches to bone now
When niggas peep your home out
And flip when they zoned out
Thugs bringing the street war
Bust shots let the heat roar
Taking trips to be more
With bricks up in to fiend off
The towns where they spray shit
Bust rounds and lay shit
Selling pounds' a great shit
And clowns get their face-lift
Spots where gats pop off
Shots clear the block off
Slugs knock your block off
And have you licking hot sauce

Thoughts of laying hos down (The streets)
Blocks where they lick shots
And rock what the fifth cocked

Towns where niggas kill at
Posting where it's real at
Keeping gats concealed at
See a foe you peel at
Strip where you get ripped off
Hot lead get licked off
Fronting and your clicks off
All your jewels get stripped off
Sidewalks where they creep up
Get locked up with a street bop
Kids running with heats up
Lifting both of your feets up
Niggas they let their guns loose
They wild guns loose

Blow a niggas shit through the sunroof
Decide where they pack nines

You outta line niggas get flat lined

Beef turning to combat
For life so they pump gats
Little kids they harm that
Put bombs where your moms at

And smacked up with big gats
Get found with they wig cracked
Leave 'em right where they live at (The streets)

Blood flowing in red streets
Mad fellas with bread schemes
Running from the FED team

Straight giving their crouch up

Crack blocks and weed spots

Tryin' to stay from out the range of the scanners
Not tryin' to get my frame in the camera
Avoid tabloids and front pages
Bums get knocked off and bumped for favors
Collect Trump papers with pumps and gauges

Got homicide searchin' the city dump for neighbors
Pinky ring with a chunk of glacier
Copped a spot with a bunch of acres

Then I laid up with my bitch and got rocked with brain
Release me from this Elymer Fudd shit, the glove don't fit
Too tall for the cop description and slugs don't fit
He was hit with a nine right? I bust slugs with a fifth
You got any of my D.N.A. or blood up in this bitch?
I'm not the guy aligned to fall, this not my crime at all
You lock me up, I'm climbin' the wall
You want me scapegoat, so stay close, alliance will call
With some grimy niggas schemin' on the shines in the hall
Fuck that, you and the D.A. spit-shine our balls
You can catch up with me some other time, from mines to yours

[Killa Sin]
Come on a plea bargain for what, your honor?
Nah yo I ain't do shit, the only thing I'm coppin' is a new whip
The night it happened I was lampin' at a deuce flick with two chicks
Kim and Chris, we guzzle Cris' on some Rush Hour 2 shit
I knew the kid, yeah we had problems, yeah I robbed him
Now it's '98 though and the handgun was a revolver
You tryin' to play me on an old case but I hold no weight
Turned myself in, I skated on them keystone jakes
Right description, right Killa, wrong case, I didn't hit him
Here's the verdict, not guilty, not tryin' to see a prison
Got my life on the line, you want to grind me through ya system
And have my family and my wiz cryin', I miss 'em
You buggin', you the same judge that framed K with the drugs
Somebody came up dead and now you want to blame us?

But I think this right here is about to shut dem damn haters down

I'm from the streets that make niggaz walk slow, talk low
With white chalk-o, mi casa be siete uno ocho
Brooklyn motherfucker, handle this
Pardon my Spanish and French

Okay, I stay clever like Mayweather with lay leather
Till your face sever, one of the greatest ever
Beyond ringin' bells, my name's so demandin'
Shit, I got the swagger that'll leave Dakota Fanning

I hope you niggaz over standin', I stay sucker-free
The next king of in the game, you ain't got enough to be
Your career last a week, that'll be luckily
Fuck with me, the rap game'll need protective custody

I'm the same thug that be surrounded with women
Gave the game true religion before you found it in denim
Feel the Wrath of Kane and you could not escape
The hip hop version of ?The Ring? and you just watched the tape

And keep your eyes on the niggas in Ward
Triple black in the candy painted car is the color of board
Me or my brother on pall with n'am nigga
We trill, workin' the wheel, understand nigga?

I smother and split a bitch down to the tendon
High pressure, if you don't break your ass bendin'
I'm way past endin' in my series of warnin'
You flex with me tonight, playa, you dead by the mornin'

Bun Beater, the best ever breathin' or deceased
From the South to Midwest, Cali to the East
Go to any city nigga and bring my name up
I bet I eat the best rapper they got in the game up

Call a nigga up, email him or chirp him
Make a meal out his motherfuckin' ass and then burp him
Don't fuck around, I'm not your lil' homey
I'm the King of the Underground, so act like you know me

Homie, we big steppin', big reppin'
We givin' kids Smith & Wesson's lessons, you get left with a sketchin'
Left with the Midwest, clique Texans
G. and Daddy Kane, the click Texas, pop you to death

I put private planes on swift Jetsons, niggaz know what it is
When you see the ball cap and a slick Thessons
Till you strip vexin? to a movie clip from the Westerns
Shit from the Uzi clip lift up your midsection

He will introduce you to the nose on the Glock fam
Give you metal jackets like clothes from a rock band
Multiple holes, you get those on your top, man
High roller dose some hoes on the cock plan

Froze but never coldly rolls with a hot hand
We stackin' cheese till the rubber bands pop scrams
And I ain't breakdancin' when I'm in the pop stance
Bank pounds like James Brown give 'em ?Hot Pants?

I make your girl get down and open it up
Put my dick up in they jaws and go in they butt
I'm a young hot street flame, they call me Sweet James
Or call me Sir Jones, two hundred dollar cologne

Board Nine or Issey Miyaki
I got your girl mine, meat strong like saki
I ain't Rocky but I keep her rockin'
Fuck around, I'll knock your tuna fish out of socket

Your bitch out of pocket, she under pimpery
She reckless eyeballin' watchin' my top fall in
On my Lamborghini with the quick scream
Fettucini, linguine, shrimp and a bowl of lean

What you know about gettin' cross country?
Nigga, your piece big but your diamond look monkey

That ain't no Emmy diamonds what the fuck you done to that

When I tussle, they'll be piecin' niggaz back like fuckin' puzzles.
'Cause Kool G. Rap is known for bringin' mad noise, a bad boy.
When I was younger, always carried guns, I never had toys.
Grimm, gimme the infrared, they see me, and I'm puttin' red dots
On niggaz foreheads, to makin' motherfuckers indian.
You got beef? Go get yourself a wreath, because it's murder. 
'Cause I put holes in my beef, like fuckin' White Castle burgers.
So now I gots to run up on a clown with the fo' pound.
Cock back, rock black, gun a nigga down.
I see 'em, he's comin' out the fuckin' Coliseum,
And hopped into a B-M, shit! 
Put in my clip, and then I dipped into the ride that my man had, 
Parked on the sidewalk, then we start to glide.
I'm rainin' on him, (faster nigga.) oh yeah, we're gainin' on him.
(Oh shit, he's with somebody else.)  Fuck it, put his brain on him.
Boom, boom, no survivors, lifted the nigga out his seat.
When they find him, he'll be a backseat driver.
But I ain't finished with the trigger yet, I'm lightin' up a cigarette.
Bang, bang, I left the other nigga wet.

Kool G Rap,"Ayo, i’m back after nine years, that’s 36 seasons
Shit is changed up for all types of reasons
Staten island ain’t the same, shit is lame
No familiar faces son, i’m dodging the game
I want a clean slate, but these cops stay screwin’
Snatching me up off the block, what am I doin’?
Oh, it’s officer dingle and his sidekick berry
Driving me around the hood so I could worry
See how fucked up it is there’s crackheads on every corner
Kids in the schoolyard smoking marijuana
I ain’t feeling it, this ain’t the way I left these blocks
And my name’s faded out like some old damn socks
I want respect, these streets was my playground once
I was the mack across 110th on these stunts
Not once would a nigga test me or gets zesty
I would walk down the street and sneeze, they all blessed me

Been on the battlefield for a long, long time
I can see life closing in on this old body of mine

Yeah, homie, i’m the kingpin called future
Make a killin’ in these buildings in the millions
Got ‘em feeling like brewster
Shit hot as fallujah
Kids grown now, they cock rugers
Welcome back to the sewers
Where new whips maneuver
No kids playing, no safe and sound havens
There’s tre pound cases on the playground pavement
No more dudes with 22’s in their sneaker soles
Kids tote shit that leave your body with a heap of holes
I’m that neighborhood blizzard flooding these streets with snow
Heavy iron on the ready, my shit’ll crease your clothes
Keep a flock of sweetest hoes, yeah, I sleeps with those
Little slum young keisha coles with cheaper clothes
Undercovers all around the gutter, they creepin’ low
I stays ahead, kid, I toss bread like pizza dough
I keep the tef around my torso with the piece below
That bulldog short nose, g be at peace with those, you know

Been on the battlefield for a long, long time
I can see life closing in on this old body of mine

Mama bear was a church woman, pop’s skated off
I was impaired, an introverted youngin’, a lot changed my course
From nowhere to my first onion then them cops came 
Across flashed the badge, took my stash, told my little ass get lost
Threw me off when my grind was prime time then
You could step on and stretch mine’s to a nine times ten
I was gone, remembering though that fine line’s thin
So I studied that chessboard and we were all blind men
Dealers ran the streets, but the d’s ran them
I was a killer underneath, but needed expansion
Something to constitute being high in a coupe
The cries from my youth so I applied for the suit
Salute to the enforcer, call me officer now
Supporter of paraphernalia, I toss it around
The link to the cartel, costs is down
It’s that denzel in training day shit, caution my grounds

While the plates rotates his fingers cling
To the records on felts, your earwax melts
Scratching so hard that he breaks the belts
DJ's relax, kneecaps collapse
My rap perhaps is like a booby trap
Polo the big boar, I'm the warrior of metaphor
Fully equipped manipulating my competitor
And I remain just like a stain
As long as I maintain my brainiac brain
Rap words rehearsed since first grade
My utensil is the pencil and his is a blade

With a AMG kit, in his pockets a mitt
And if you try to steal his shit, by a pitch you get bit

On my way to the beach picking up girls in bikinis
I’m a hip-hop star and yo I’m bound to go far
And all the girlies jump right on it

Smoking so bad I'm a cause a pollution 
With satisfaction baddest action fatal attraction 
Drop you to an improper fraction
 
Ill insanity kill like Amity 
Ville horror as I wipe out humanity 
Won't leave a path a track, a trail to trace 
But when you're staring inside a mirror, you see my face 
And I'll terrify, so don't ever try 
To shake or bake or flake cause I never fry
 
Letters together sly as a fox clever than ever 
Silly ducks write rhymes with feathers 
Really dope needles are needed to inject this 
Dope cause I'm a death wish, not even Bob Hope's 
Rhymes are rugged, soul flooded, cold blooded 
You ain't better, you're butter, so just shut it 

Here to perform, having a brainstorm, make a rain form 
How rap groups run to keep the name warm 
Putting heads to beddy-bye like Freddy so get ready 
Cause I'm a get crazier than Crazy Eddie 
I'm alone but my tone is a sharp tune 
Developing pictures in your brain like a darkroom 
Rappers are captured and tortured with rapture 

In 3-D is a G coming at you 
Words in my rap will surprise you like Cracker Jacks 
You dig them like Sugar Smacks and bite them like Apple Jacks 
Brother, sister, misses or mister 
My style is complicated, patterns like a twister 
Throws, my shadow grows when I walk slow 

Nerds are scared to be heard so they talk low 
But I've been urging to drill in your brain like a surgeon 
Rhymes so dope and they're busting you up like a virgin 
More competitors change to challenger 
You need to talk into a mic with a silencer 
My defeat is like a mission impossible 
My brain is unexplained, not illogical 
Tough for a passing pate to assassinate 
Guns in your ass so fast, it'll fascinate 

You try to duplicate to get up to date 
Can't wait to peep my profile on paper, mate 
The innovator with greater data, deeper than a crater 
Of course, Polo's the boss of the cross fader 
The rage is on, my rhymes are airborne 
Stage is torn to wreck, my murdering gear's on 
Moving a head, never bled inside a bloodshed 
Nothing is said, instead heads are dead 

G Rap manages styles, taking all the advantages 
Putting sucker rappers in bandages 
I got a plot so hot it'll tan 
I might be cool but I'm far from a fan 
Letting you know how it is in show biz 
Give me a prince and I'm a show you a G wiz 
Bright as Einstein, brighter than sunshine 
Rhymes will intoxicate like moonshine
 
Total disaster the broadcaster master 
Passed ya as the tempo goes faster 
Sparks shoot out from the mic when I rhyme ignites 
All types of words I write, put in flight 
Rappers evaporate to vapor, I drop science on paper 
And then build a skyscraper 

When I die, scientists will preserve my brain 
Donate it to science to answer the unexplained 
But as long as I inhale and exhale 
I challenge the next female or the next male 
What you hear in your ears all appears to be clear 
Consider me fear cause I shear ideas 
That sticks to the mix, more tricks that a 666

And the records I make explode in every zip code

And I'm the waiter cause I serve imitators 
Who try to duplicate like an emulator 
Try to get paid copying a name brand

Now hear the diaper, cause I'm a sniper 
You want to get hyper? 
Prepare for hyperspace and just flow with the bass 
And fall in place, just keep up the pace no time to waste 
Just enter the place to see the entertainer 
My rhymes keep me fresh like a container 

Some rappers said, my rap is dead 
Shake your head to my bass like a base head 
There'll be bloodshed, enemies shot 
Those who beef get sliced into pork chops 
Until your fork stops stabbing my rhymes 

From the latest and the greatest of all times 
Sleep while you knock Z's, I'm a clock G's 
Freeze rap heroes below zero degrees 
Rhymes like thieves will seize enemies 
That want to be G, like the Bee Gees 
Not rated PG, we break necks 
Like sex, rated XXX 
Yes, Doc the Butcher is who I recommend 
DJ Polo let the record spin 

Construction put on paper 
Listen cause I'm building a skyscraper 
For a strong foundation of wheels of steel 
Not a reel to reel, but the real deal 
Polo works the cross fader, he's a bricklayer 
And the record player turns like the Himalaya 
Doc the Butcher supplies the cement 

And the rhymes that I invent is the blueprint 
While I'm using my mind to make a design 
Polo puts up the Men at Work sign 
Yeah, we still building, making a skeleton 
One of the sucker MC's just fell again 
So take caution if you want to know the truth 

I'm a elevate you up to the roof 
Listen to the sound, don't dare look down 
Cause you're far from the ground 
Now you're impressed cause words I manifest 
Takes you more higher than cess or Buddha bless

Yo word Polo, broken heart ain't no joke, man

Yo, why don't you really tell
Them how you feel about it, man

Love is pain left out in the rain
With nothing to gain but teardrop stains
Being haunted by a memory as I think back
The things we used to do and how we used to act
With love and trust, passion and plussed
Because a pride never kept things inside
Yo they was always discussed
Between us, never argued about
And I never gave a clue for you to figure it out
How I miss being blessed with your sweet finesse
As we kiss and twist and caress on the mattress
Sweet body heat, your heartbeat
I'll grip your hips and both of
Our lips will meet so neat
Staring up at the moonlight with someone to hold tight
Given a chance for romance until the sunlight
Brightens the sky, it reflects in your eye
But now, the reflection is gone and I cry out

She loves me, she loves me not
Yo she loves me

Looking at your picture as it sits on the table
As I put on my cable I wish that I was able
To touch but it's a shame that you had to go
So I watch the hands on the clock go real slow
Gone with the wind, is love a sin?
If it is then God, then bring it back again
Not a girl that you rate as a fine blind date
I need a love mate so I can create
So I open a window to feel the wind blow
Try to figure out how can a love end so
Fast and just pass and not even last
First grow like grass, then shatter like glass
Now I stare at the walls, clock five Tylenols
Unplug the telephone to avoid phone calls
As I sit and crave for the love she gave
But when I wake up, I'm the same love slave

When you lost a good friend, dreams seem to end
'Cause broken hearts and men don't blend
So I'm not here to stick every chick I can pick
You move too quick, you become seasick
And a one-night stand is for the one-track mind man
The kind of guy you kick like a can
So I race in space and try to replace the pretty face
But it's a waste, this chase is a kiddy case
Now I whisper how much I missed her
My lips should have blistered the way I kissed her
So soft and slow, laid back and relaxed
And when I move, the groove is as smooth as a sax
She kissed me low and then proceeded up
Bedsheets heated up, the pace is speeded up
Slowly but surely we reach our destiny
She got the best of me and left the rest of me
Now all I got is total confusion
She disappeared and it's not an illusion
My life is bitter, the memories glitter
I feel like dirt, so please do not litter
My heart's deflated, doctors can't rate it
I don't know how the hell I made it
So farewell sweetheart wherever you are
I'll just look at a star, and say yo

I want to say something about this girl I know 
She tried to play me out though check it out 

This I dedicate to the girl I hate 
It's a piece of my mind rhyme put on a plate 
So yo go ahead swinger I'm putting up my middle finger 
I'm not sad or mad I don't feel anger 
You're not all that fly trying to play the role 
I had girls that looked better on the hoe stroll 
Working night patrol, you know what I mean? 
I get cash and still wear Jordache jeans 
You thought your drug-dealing man was much better 
Because he always came and got you in a plush Jetta 
Or an Audi, a Benz, or a Jaguar 
You didn't think G. Rap was going that far 
I'm here to tell of, because you thought I fell off 
And now if you're riding the tip, just get the hell off 
You wanted to leave because you didn't believe that I would achieve 
Cause you had something up your sleve 
Perhaps you might have thought I'm a dreamer with a fat head 
Now you're stuck with a baby from a crack head 
Come to my shows, you want to check to see if I wreck it 
The only record your man got is a jail record 
I know you like him a lot because he's a big shot 
The only picture you got is his mug shot 
I'm on a label with well know singers in it 
Look, your man's getting booked and fingerprinted 
Polo drives a Benz from state to stae 
By the way, guess who made his license plates 
Thought I was finished, down, going through the blues 
Here's a hundred dollars, go buy some new shoes 
Go ahead good looking, you can keep booking 
From my recital I'll never get my title tooken 
So you got a little 9 to 5, so what? 
What do you do for a living, slice cold cuts? 
You look slick, but you know every Tom and Dick 
You're more quick than a chick from a porno flick 
While you scrub floors, I go on tours 
From me, G Rap, yo, truly yours 

(Yo G man! You should diss her man. I heard he's a homo jimmy man!) 
Listen up money, or should I say honey? 
You're looking more sweeter than a Playboy bunny 
Fingernails filed, your hair is styled 
And the gear that you wear looks hot and wild 
Everybody says is he, some kind of sissy? 
Your name was ""Moose"" but now they call you ""Missy"" 
Night or day lights, you fall for the gay rights 
I thought you would stay bright, but now you want to play fight 
With men, and Len, your real close friend 
But you wouldn't be his friend if his knees didn't bend 
You're not a lady dear, you're a square and a queer 
Barrettes in your hair, bamboo in your ear 
Running in cars, hanging out in bars 
Winking your eyes to guys that wear bras 
Skintight Levi's and even knee highs 
Don't try to lie, sugar, I know why 
In the ladies bathroom, spraying on perfume 
Stuffing your t-shirt with two balloons 
You don't think about the opposite sex at all 
Instead of sugar walls, you'd rather have a ball 
Way back in the days, you was as big as a cow 
But look at you now, at jams you say ""ow"" 
A sex disease was a common as TB 
But gays today get VD in 3-D 
And that is called AIDS in case you didn't know 
And the only blow I'm giving is this knockout blow 
Switching with your bandana looking like Diana Ross 
From me G Rap, yo, truly yours 

(Hey yo, finish dissing that girl, man) 
Yo, do me a favor, and pick up a pen and pad 
And try and write down the numbers of the men you've had 
So remember when you're putting someone else in check 
Go to the Wizard of Oz and get some self-respect 
Won't say no names, it might leave a permanent scar 
I don't have to go that far, you know who you are 
And if you don't, then everybody else does 
'Cause all the fellas be telling me how good you was 
I can't accept a girl with a ruined rep 
I'm like a chef, I just cook up the stew and step 
Off with her clothes, like Moby Dick, there she blows 
She want to throw like the girls from the peep shows 
Your man was large, but now he's getting kinda tiny 
And you run up behind me trying to get pregnant by me 
And in a year, I'll bet you'll be on welfare 
Don't cry for help dear, you put yourself there 
The way it looks, you'll end up in Playboy books 
While your man is in Manhattan snatching pocket books 
Bugging and mugging with a big 12 gauge 
Starving so bad I can see his ribcage 
Yo, you used to tell me all the time that you would be a model 
Later in life, you're living in a crack bottle 
So when you're begging on your knees because I'm clocking G's 
You'll be in zero degrees getting processed cheese 
Wearing dungares, yo baby I don't need a girl with broken hands 
'Cause his man's a woman beater 
So when you get sores, from giving up drawers 
Remember cool G Rap said ""Truly Yours"" 

Yo, I don't even know why you tried to play me honey 
Now I'm down with Warner Brothers getting Bugs Bunny money

Kool G Rap & DJ Polo,"I'm bad to the bone with a style like Al Capone 
I'ma smile while I give you the dial tone 
Eatin' shrimp and girls I be pimpin' 
Walk like I'm limpin' this brother ain't simpin' 
Not to mention I'm winner of Mack Daddy conventions 
I get a lot of attention 
Sleepin' in sheets that's made of satin 
With one of my money makin' honies she's mixed Spanish and Latin 
She's a fly type of swinger 
Twenty carats on her fingers, minks on every coat hanger 
In a high rise, made for only fly guys 
With a size that attracts the ladies eyes 
Keepin' the stash and the cash flow 
Profile's kept low, more dough than Barry Manilow 
Fly cars, I got diamonds in jelly jars 
To earn respect, collectin' bar fight scars 
Slick talkin' with a chick when I'm walkin 
Midnight stalkin', all the suckers be hawkin' 
And I max while you be waxin' your Cadillacs 
Smooth as a fax, but I can cut you like an axe 
Big spender, cause I'm a winner like Bruce Jenner 
I burn all beginners and let em simmer like a TV dinner 
On the phone cause I'm hard like stone 
Holdin' my own, cause I'm bad to the bone 

I'm gettin' cash and, ladies receive my passion 
Parties I'm crashin' with a flashy type of action 
On stage, I kick outrageous 
And I enslave the bravest, more diamonds than Sammy Davis 
I'm more dramatic than Dallas is 
More pretty than a palace is, hands no callouses 
Give me a clever girl and I'll outfox her 
The man that rocks her in pure silk boxers 
So what you want honey a chump or a champ? 
Visa or food stamps, Latins or lamps? 
I run the game like Sega 
Go to war like Noreaga, hit like Schwarzenegger 
Excitin' when I'm fightin' I'm frightenin' 
Stick chicks slick in quick like greased lightning 
Ladies I'll love you all tomorrow like Annie 
And I bet you'll all leave with wet panties 
'Cause I can make a eighty yard dash come back fast 
Wrap rappers all up in the back, like a jackass 
Police want to harass me 
'Cause I got all the material that has me lookin' jazzy 
The MC patroller 
Pockets so fat, I flat em down with a dough roller 
Dead zone when I strike the microphone 
G. Rap's known, cause I'm bad to the bone 

I never needed a helpin' handin' 
I'm outstandin', type of guy, girls never abandon 
And when I'm rollin' with force, three across your belly 
Knockin' suckers out the box like I'm playin' skelly 
Cause I pull out the .45 if you offend me 
And leave the barrel of it smokin' like a chimney 
Rhymes are dynamic, voice is Titanic 
Gigantic, suckers get frantic and then panic 
A smooth talker, cause I'm a Queens New Yorker 
My rhymes bring more Good Times than Jimmie Walker 
A bumrusher, cause I'm a crusher of hardrocks 
When I turn thirty, I'll still be dirty as Redd Foxx 
Try to cope, what I wrote, get a sore throat 
My lyrical notes float like sailboats 
I keep it steady for the petty sucker rappers I'll be ready 
I got more bodies than Frank Netti 
Battles I win em cause I send em to hell when I begin em 
Because I put it in em like a venom 
Discover the toughest rap brother you ever seen 
Not a fairy, but milky like the Dairy Queen

Kool G Rap & DJ Polo,"Boy come on get with this cause you can't diss this 
I'm burning yo' ass like syphilis 
A fast brother you're just a lover with a sore hand 
I freeze MC's as if Frosty the Snowman 
No man withstands the pain I bring 
So face a hell raise of cut like a laser 
Polo plays a part inside the arts I grab charts 
Start to break you apart so get smart 
You cry for help knowing you felt the rhyme 
Making the track melt, Polo drops like a black belt 
MC's are grounded, pounded down, astound 
They rounded up, pounds of sounds, but I drowned them 
Surround to check the tape, and play when rate too great 
Related too late, I demonstrate fate 
I'm fast and, passing the stage of an assassin 
Massacre, in a mash I start blasting 
Fury article, periodical 
Blowing up all the cools and molecules, here read the articles 
Every time I build the plan and killed the man 
MC's got smoked without a filter and 
Skunked them up like marijuana 
Terminator of data and your rhymes is Sarah Conner 
You can't rip out, rap up, slip up, slap up 
'Cause you're trapped up, to get capped up 
Play the back of dis here scenery 
You clowns will get broke down like machinery 
I bring trouble on the double, bust you like a bubble 
Hard rocks get crushed into rubble 
The gates of hell open wide to scope in 
And I'm hopin', you're brought to the Pope and 
The holy bible when you made your arrival 
Now the name of the game is survival 
The result isn't real difficult to strategy 
I'm ""Stayin Alive"" like John Travolta 
My rhymes are gettin' hotter, I gotta 
Round to allow clowns like a Globetrotter 
So I'ma give you the hell that you brought me in 
I'm a king with the sting of a scorpion 
I just follow your footprint, trace track and blackout 
You better shout to get a rap out 
What I arrange invented, it's strange demented 
The range, be changed when I entered 
A stage of furious rage when I had this madness 
Badness, you felt sadness 
Raps are brave and outrageous; all those 
Chicken rhymes you written should be put in the Yellow Pages 
I stand tall, play the wall, and watch them brain stall 
And wet yo' ass like rainfall 
I think you need a replacement, you're illin' 
Call that building boy, you're still in the basement 
A brain cell swells to jam like a pelican 
Fresh out of breath, death left you a skeleton 
I'm gonna need your full cooperation 
This is a matter of life and death operation 
To ease a man in the siege of surgery 
Of being done without anesthesia 
Go slow, hell no, I let the beat kick 
And I get wicked like the Witches of Eastwick 
I'm not soft, I kill suckers off 
Disarming it, bombing it, off in a coffin 
You get struck, and just like a motherfucking duck 
And plucked and shit out of luck and fucked 
Designated to self-destruct 
Knocked around like a hockey puck 
K-double-O-L-G-are-A-P, N-O M-see plays me 
You wish your name had a G but to be 
A badder G boy you gotta play with strategy

You get upset when you hear the Large Professor 
On your girl's cassette deck expect 
Nothin comin soft 'cause I'll never throw weaker blows 
I'll kick you in your [ass] and your breath'll smell like sneaker soles 
Now how's that for a fixin'? 
You'd better rather go to Roy's, cause I ain't kickin' science fiction 
I kick a size nine sneaker or boot 
Chop chumps to stumps, and they remain minute 
The Sheik, I get deep, and always leave with the wet meat 
Because of my technique, I'm the one you let speak 
I collect crops and props like spinach 
I'm vintage, your single sums up to a ten inch 
My soul brother Van Paul and Pete Rock 
Keep the funk flowin' until the last beat stops 
The soul man, can't have you leavin' on a stretcher 
Probably, have you leavin in leather, I catch a body 
From wreckin' slum rappers, but to be frank 
I don't give a [fuck] I got money in the bank

When you're sittin' by your radio, screamin', ""Freddie Foxxx goes next"" 
Those beholdin' the words of a master 
Find mental disaster, as I kick it faster 
Whoever opposes me, and what I feel 
Might find their legs bein' replaced by steel 
This is a brand new year, and the penalty is death 
So there won't be a lot of suckers left 
I grab the mic, and I load it like a long four-fifth 
Huh, and dare you to riff 
Or even sneeze as I blow you to your knees, have you curled up 
In a corner like a dog, with hoof in mouth disease 
Spittin' razor blades, cuttin' veins you can't stitch 
I got you screamin like a [bitch] 
I took your microphone, you can't get it back 
Because your rap was wack 
I'm comin' fifty strong in an armored tank 
And takin' money to the bank 

""Money in the bank, yeahhhh"" 
""Rocked and rolled, but then you rolled and rocked"" 
""Money in the bank, yeahhhh""

Cool G. Rap for your first selection, get up on it 
To my opponents, let me just demonstrate for a minute 
Crooks gettin' hooked, to my book, just like an addiction 
Stop your diction you drop, the science fiction 
Let's get specific you can't get with it 
I'm too terrific and scientific, forget it 
Don't even try to limp it, you're not ready to make hits 
You still got a learner's permit 
Poppin' that [shit], you better sit 
Here's a word, of a third degree burn, so listen and learn 
You're missin' a turn, so you better get, concerned 
My challenger, check the calendar 
I'm as live as a .45 caliber, Colt 
With a silencer, wettin' up, suckers I be settin' up 
Button up, while I'm cuttin' up, never lettin' up 
I don't link up, with suckers with raps that shrank 
Thanks sonny, I'm takin' money to the bank 

""Money in the bank, yeahhhh"" 
""Rocked and rolled, but then you rolled and rocked"" 
""Money in the bank, yeahhhh""

One in the chamber, eight in the clip 
Pull out a razor, watch your rhyme book rip 
It's Ant Live, liver and deliveries get liver 
With G. Rap, and we're the sole survivors 
MC's want to try me, but can't escape, my clutch 
Too much, caught in the ropes, like double dutch 
You want to run up, you better run up light 
Cause like a whorehouse shippin' out [pussy] tonight 
Believe me I ain't goin' out like a brick parachute 
Or a fruit, or a guy that wears Brut 
Cologne, I'm violent prone, so leave me alone 
I'm about to set fire to the microphone 
And leave the mic so hot you need potholders for this 
Due to burnt wires it's cordless

Kool G Rap & DJ Polo,"Play it again Polo, cause I just can't stand still
I burn while the tables turn like windmills
A swift reactor rap, to impact up the track ?
I flow like a sailor

Rhymes remain hittin hard like Nighttrain
With lyrics that came from the brain of Mark Twain
So if you can't handle the man please go and change the channel
Rappers are gettin smoked like Camels

To weather the brainstorm, fellas better grab your umbrellas
People run inside the cellars
As I teach you're attached to my rhyme like a leash
Takin the S off my speech to fight peach

Take the P off the peach because now you want each
And every rhyme to teach and reach
You need a fixin, for your fake rhymes lyrics and weak mixin
You robbin em blind like Nixon

Some got shook when they took a look
I'm burnin you up, like the lyrics that are pages of a cookbook
I attract more kids than Wonderama
Rhymes got more drama, than black momma white momma

You get defeated decapitated captivated
'Cause you hated the fact G. Rap made it
So if you slow you blow like a hoe, so here's a solo
Ah-yo, play it again Polo

Here's a fellow, sayin hello, Polo, mellow
P-O-L-O, shake em like Jell-o
Sonny you're funny like Johnny Carson
So I'm a enjoy, watchin your butt burn up just like an arson

These rhymes here can kill son
You try to rips it just call me the ? Flip Wilson
And rhymes I got em down pat
Release this hit like the Superfly soundtrack

Too dope of a type windpipe full of hype
And I sideswipe the suckers I snipe
The mic so hot, it can weld when it's hell
And assassinate, like Lee Harvey Os-wald

Rough on the radio, Sony or Sanyo
Rappers get slayed and played like a banjo
When I illustrate, stiller rhymers is iller
Battle me, you better swallow a bottle of painkillers

I go faster and faster, skills of a Grandmaster
Makin you fall like plaster
Amazed, grammar plays like gamma rays
Chumps are caught in the blaze and dumped in ashtrays

You pussy willow, I can see your sihlouette
You're scared, and tears of fear made your pillow wet
You want to tic-tac-toe with a big rap pro?
Yo, play it again Polo

Guys are weary, eyes be teary, survived and leary
Your rhymes are eerie, that's my theory
I'm here to jam and slam like Bam-Bam
Damn, Polo play it again like Sam

Cuts in harmony, you ain't harmin me
Your beats are moist and your sweet voice is charmin me
Not flexible, your style needs to be twisted
Plus your name's unlisted

Rhymes are tough like gristle, watch the boy sizzle
Your brainstorms don't even drizzle
But my brainstorms gives lots of pain, lots of rain
Long spins, the strong winds of a hurricane

You get sunken when I hit a punk and
Rag a fag, makin him stagger like he drunken
You can't stop treatin my hip-hop
Like a Blo Pop, chew up the slop like a gumdrop

Makin you sweat like a death threat, slow when I flow
I'm a let, Polo wet up the whole set
Yes the final, death wish to sucker MC's
Gets granted, with rhymes makin em stand planted

I start blowin blows, and my rhymes are like a bolo
So hey, play it again Polo","Play It Again, Polo",1990

Your record player ain't nothing without the funky rhyme sayer 
Cool G. Rap cause to the little I'm an idol 
Attacking the vital parts to maintain my title

And gigantic just like the Atlantic ocean 
As I flow in slow motion 
And I be cooking you suckers like tan lotion 
The K-double-O-L, G-R-A-P, and P-O-L-O 
Would like to say hello to you mellow fellow 
What are you yellow? You're hiding like a coward 
And I don't allow it, you get devoured

A prescription, so just walk like an Egyptian 
My instrumentals ain't up for rental 
But come and try em and if you want to buy em then I supply em 
I got the source of an orchestra 
But if you don't pay the cost to the boss then I'm forcing ya 
You said you're ready like Freddie to battle me 
But the real Freddie's Dead and I ain't Curtis Mayfield 
All wise, with four I's/eyes like Mississippi 
You try to trip me, but I just play it cool 
Just like a hippie, to be like G, this is the number one rule 
Play it cool 
 
I just glide, these are the tales from the brain side 
With lyrics and the beats I provide they collide 
To form a homicide, you get dragged in a big bag 
Shell ? ricochet, so watch em zig-zag 
Off angle, but I'm in shape like a triangle 
I need a sucker to strangle, with my new single 
All rhymes are terrifying, you're dying 
You might as well be in a cage with a mountain lion 
When I hear the bell ring, I'm swinging head level 
Burning your block, my rhymes hotter than Red Devil 
So peel off, like a potato (""Cool"") 
Cause I play it cool like the music inside a elevator 
Doc the Butcher is a true blue musician 
I'm getting busy while suckers are going fishing 
Or out to lunch, as they munch and they crunch 
On a bunch of stellar rhymes, so I just give em a Hawaiian Punch 
And let em stagger, giving em lipstick and they Mick Jagger 
Lyrics are sharper than a dagger 
Agony, yeah I'm bragging nobody's bagging me 
To the bedroom, your girlfriend is dragging me 
I make the hits radios won't swing, but that's OK (""Cool"") 
Hey, cause everything is still cool and the Gang (""Cool"") 
Let's party cause everybody plays the fool 
But I play it cool 

 
I play it cool, making you kneel, squirm and squeal 
My name ain't Rodney but I'm standing on the Dangerfield 
And my shows, I bust em out just like a virgin 
Cause I get stupid but I'm smarter than a brain surgeon 
G. Rap is here to bury 
So duck emcees, I send em to the Pet Cemetery 
Your whole crew turns chicken when they finish 
watching you die, so please stand by as I fry 
You kinda sour so I dip you in some flour 
Read my book, it says cook for about an hour 
Ring the dinner bell, brain cells are well done 
It's time you got a story, don't tell none 
So this here is the only I'm sane 
So play it cool (""Cool) or you'll be heading for the dead pool 
I play it cooler than a band in the North Pole 
But I never freeze up or catch a cold 
Never stiff, I shoot the gift kinda swift 
Try to riff, and you'll needing a face lift 
Cause I'm a teacher and a trainer, a preacher and a explainer 
World's greatest entertainer 
I approach like a coach to the umpire 
And like live wire I'm a start a dumb fire

Looking like raggedy Ann, no dough in hand kicking a can
Thinking of a plot to pull some bank in
Because I'm dead and stinking
Soles on my shoes winking, t-shirt is shrinking
Soon I see some ties and my eyes open wide quick
Who's that with you, chick? Bill blass my sidekick
What's up, black? give his hand a smack
Up pulls a Cadillac, yo baby we'll be back
Jumped right on inside, not too many people saw us
Thinking about who gotta get robbed because the mob got a job for us
The drove us down to the sober section
Of town where the clowns don't be paying for protection
The want us to send a message to jimmy the bartender
Lend a friend the money next you're ripping off his car fenders
He's coming up short cause he snorts
Coke, dope, nope, and hope he don't get caught
He owes some Benjamin Franklins, every last bit of 'em
But Jimmy's pockets are empty, so now we gotta get rid of him
But Jimmy's wife is with him and they don't want to involve her
Hopped out the back seat they gave me a revolver
Blass, you distract him while I go and whack him
Entered through the back side of the bar and then attacked him

Shot him in the back of the head and shanked him with a knife

Moneygrip's pocket's looking thick so I stick slick
Hold it right here, hands in the air, I know you got the loot
Or better yet, face down on the ground, empty your pockets troop
Hit the deck I got the tech right on your neck
And I expect to make a buck to heck with a traveler's check
But if a vic' tries to choke me
I'll have to smoke him like I'm smokey the bear, so okie dokie
Goodbye, or bon voyage, have a good journey
Don't even try begging for your life, that don't concern me
So to the next weasel that freezes
Your begging and your pleases only getting your closer to meeting Jesus
Yeah, I shake a schmuck just to make a buck
Then I break a duck and if the duck gotta get bucked then I don't give a fuck
Hyper as a sniper piping niggas like a plumber
Cold vicking and sticking up the ones that run the numbers
Or even a bigger score, the lady in the liquor store
Go inside and kick in the door, pull her then I'm stickin' her for
Money or your life, honey hurry and choose
You lose, because I got the ill street blues

[Chorus]

Extra extra read all about it in the papers
The boss tried to rape us, so we tossed him off the skyscraper
Because he pulled some other people to try and hit us
Get us, but none of them did us, he must be trying to kid us
But that's dead, I'll thank God in the red, 'cross the bread borders
So nobody can short us, he fled down to headquarters
Ready to put some work in, we're not a lazy crew, we'll do a job or two
But yo, the man can't even stick me with some crazy glue
Ready to tore him even more because she saw him
We took out all the lookouts in the front and kicked his door in
What's up snake, why'd you violate?
Because I'm a hossa (what's that? )
Yo, that's a pig that don't fly straight
Getting ready to jab him, I grabbed him by the necktie
Homie tried to get fly, and swing I gave him a decked eye
You know the evil that men do, hell is where the men go
We snatched him by his hands and feet and threw him out the window
Up, up, and away cause I don't play, clown
Buck, buck, buck, take that with you on the way down
I'm hoping you got springs and wings on your shoes
But you lose, because I got the ill street blues

[Chorus]",Ill Street Blues,1992
Kool G Rap & DJ Polo,"""Late last night two undercover police officers were found brutally murdered in a Fort Greene 
Apartment building in Brooklyn New York. At this time police have no suspects. 
Now to the weather but first G tell 'em what time it is!"" 

I got a chance to get some money so I'm takin' it 
No joke because this bein' broke shit just ain't makin' it 
Cause I grew up in the fast line 
See my pops ran the numbers and my moms held the blackjack games 
Now I'm able to leave the cradle 
I don't remember the dinners, only the kilos on my kitchen table 
Sittin' right beside a pistol 
And I'm watchin' my pops, pick up bricks made out of crystal 
While he was countin' the green 
I seen nothin' but strainers, containers, scales and rocks on a triple beam 
People was too afraid to stick him up 
Because he had the most notorious brothers to come and pick him up 
When I reached ten years old 
I never recalled seein' any more money and drugs in the household 
'Cause now pops was on his feet 
And to keep us from gettin' hurt he kept his dirt in the street 
And if he tried to attack, your family's wearin' black 
Because he just got your death, put on a contract 
Another sucker to rub 
Even my mother's walkin' around packin' a .357 snub 
And many cops dropped dead 
I seen a man pull out a pistol and blow off an undercover's head 
'Cause it's hard to get by 
And that's why, when you're young in the streets 
You gotta live and let die 

Some say this ain't the life to choose 
Rage is snapped away you get a page in the Daily News 
But I just want to get paid off 
'Cause if I was workin' a regular nine to five I'd get laid off 
Some people say, sellin' weight, is a death date 
But I can't wait, to set up shop, in the next state 
I ain't worried bout a brother tryin' to take mines 
'Cause my plot comes with a hundred shot nine 
Police are right on my heels 
But I'm always one step ahead of the punks makin' dope deals 
They can't stop me 'cause I'm proper 
And if they ever try to raid they better bring choppers or helicopters 
I broke a lot of punks ribs 
Dumpin' they bodies in lots, then I ran and shot up the cribs 
Because a brother ain't fakin' it 
If there's a record for killin' the most niggaz then yo I'm breakin' it 
I wish a brother would flex 
I spray him up and then take all of his money and give his girl sex 
That's how I'm livin' in the street 
You either give a sucker two in the head, or you'll be dead meat 
I'm sendin' punks six feet deep 
And gettin' money in lumps, cause this ain't Twenty-One Jump Street 
You want to stop what I supply 
Aiyyo, the hell with that, I gotta live and let die 

Police, police! Everybody down, everybody down! 
Don't fucking move, get down! 
Hey, where is everybody? 
Look, there's nobody here 
What's that fucking noise?  
It's a bomb, it's a bomb, let's go 
Get the fuck out of here! 

You gotta live and let die 
Forget all that bullshit about savin' the soul 
Some chump'll pump your ass full of bullet holes 
So I'm out to make a killin' 
And all you suckers are chillin' 'cause I ain't just an ordinary villain 
I got a rep for mass murder 
If you look bigger, I just pull the trigger, a female I just hurt her 
I got the .38 long 
But a dame can get the same if she's comin' out of her mouth wrong 
And if you try to oppose this 
Next time you see your mother she'll be covered with roses 
It ain't about a fair fight 
Because I only get open for smokin' suckers in daylight 
Another punk bites the dust 
'Cause I just bust blood out your butt like pus 
The broke life I ain't missin 
Because now I got a lot, and that's more than a pot to piss in 
And if I'm sellin you ki's 
Just put the G's on the bed, and then go head and take a freeze 
And while you're numbin' your tongue with the yum yum 
I pull out a gun, cause I want every last crumb 
I put a slug in your face 
Then I waits to start packin' the trap back in the suitcase 
Another punk had to fry 
I don't want to do it but yo I gotta live and let die 

""Earlier this morning, five cops were killed And six were wounded in a raid gone bad. 
Police have no leads. For any information, please call, 1-800-Stool-Pigeon.

Kool G Rap & DJ Polo,"(""Rappers go six feat under"") (Repeat 4x)
You're scared straight as soon as G Rap penetrates
You want to escape, but you got a date to meet fate
Run for your life when I'm starting
Suckers are getting turned to missing motherfuckers on a milk carton
Danger, when I rearrange and change a face, ace
You're being replaced by a stranger
I injure, and escape like a ninja
You got struck by a fucking revenger
A bullet inserted in your head, a shot got
Murdered, nobody seen shit, nobody heard it
Fuck around, the price is more than McDonald's pays
And you can sing my blues to Billie Holiday
Put your ass in my path and I'm a blast it
Mind over matter, I burn like battery acid
Terrorizing, sizing up the guys-a
Finger on trigger, when I pull it, a bullet flys in
G's a madman, came from the Badlands
Crush niggas in my bare hands like beer cans
Leaving a gash like the New York Slasher
Showing my inches in a trench like a flasher
You got a problem, I'm a problem solver
Solve more problems with a .357 revolver
Come near you pay dearly
And I can barely hear when you talk so speak up clearly
On a sole role, the golden mic holder
And I flatten your ass just like a steam roller
Pity for niggas I waste
Try to disrespect, get the taste of a neck brace
I got your ass on target
You got beef? You better save it for the motherfucking meat market
Rhymes choke you like a headlock
If a sucker's asleep, I turn his shit into Bedrock
Come on son, get done in
Niggas are running like the redcoats is coming
I enlist punk niggas that want some of this
And what's left is the breath of a death wish
(""Rappers go six feat under"") (Repeat 4x)
A pimp that loves shrimps and lobster
And for a hobby I'm hitting niggas up like a mobster
I got a story for each little poor territory
The ghetto glory in all categories
The death threats I received from the head vests
I'm riffing, the suckers stiffen up like a dead pet
The troop that stoops to brutality
Giving all nationalities a taste of reality
cool G Rap is here to draw
And any sucker that tries to beat him, you meet him in a morgue
All victims unidentified, so check it
You gotta see if it was the sucker from the dental record
What I use to torture liars:
Either fire, barbed wire, live wire, or pliers
So you thought you could last?
Go and get a green thumb because your ass is grass
Eric B. is the undertaker
His pockets swoll because he's rolling in more dough than a baker
Quiet type, but I won't have it
Cause when I swing with the boys I get noisy like traffic
So if you know what I know, see what I see
G Rap is down with a mafioso posse
And I'm quick to go stick other suckers
With a smile just like a sick motherfucker
A bullet inside the sucker's guts and
Hit butt and his nuts, we throw him in the Hudson
This is for all the non-believers
They receive a gash in their ass from a meat cleaver
Don't even try to get fast
You know the time because I'm 5 seconds off your ass
A nightmare leaving you suckers breathless
You stepping to cool G Rap, then that's a death wish

Kool G Rap & DJ Polo,"Aw yeah word up word to mother. Here comes G. Rap with another one y'all. 
We going to swing it like this... 

I'm right in front of my front steps thinking of a plan 
Looking like Raggedy Ann no dough in hand kicking a can 
Thinking of a plot to pull some bank in 
Because I'm dead and stinking 
Soles on my shoes winking t shirt is shrinking 
Soon I see some ties and my eyes open wide quick 
Who's that with you, chick? Bill Blass my sidekick 
What's up, black? Give his hand a smack 
Up pulls a Cadillac, yo baby we'll be back 
Jumped right on inside, not too many people saw us 
Thinking about who gotta get robbed because the mob got a job for us 
The drove us down to the sober section 
Of town where the clowns don't be paying for protection 
The want us to send a message to Jimmy the bartender 
Lend a friend the money next you're ripping off his car fenders 
He's coming up short cause he snorts 
Coke, dope, nope, and hope he don't get caught 
He owes some Benjamin Franklins, every last bit of em 
But Jimmy's pockets are empty, so now we gotta get rid of him 
But Jimmy's wife is with him and they don't want to involve her 
Hopped out the back seat they gave me a revolver 
Blass, you distract him while I go and whack him 
Entered through the back side of the bar and then attacked him 
He's screaming for his life, reaching for his wife 
Shot him in the back of the head and shanked him with a knife 
And that goes for anybody who's gotta pay they dues 
You lose, cause I got the Ill Street Blues

Kool G Rap & DJ Polo,"A letter to you suckers each and every one of you duck mothafuckers 
Your girl puckers her lips so I stuck her. 
You're gellin' me yo so what the hell you tellin' me? 
Now I'm a show you fuckin' with me is a felony. 
I'm crushin. Tell you suckers to start hushin'. 
Shush no discussion 'cause I'm a start rushin'. 
The payback and I attack the pack that's wack. 
The black mack: brown like a Cracker Jack. 
Slick and quick. I got pick a bic to stick, 
To kick some shit, chicks I dick with. 
The One. Give up the fun with the gun, my son. 
I don't run, I kick mothafuckers done. 
It don't matter, I make niggas scatter, 
Teeth start to chatter, your head I'm-a splatter. 
Arraigned. Breakin' to maintain and watchin' my name bring you pain. 
I'm standin' on your blood stain. 
Hard to hold. I'm bold, I roll real cold. 
Too much soul, dick made of gold. 
I rolled niggas to hell; you tried to swell but fell. 
Now get well or die like a dry cell. 
A rap villain. Chillin' and I don't give a fuck about a killin' 
'cause I'm still in effect when you're illin'. 
A terrorist. I terrorize like an assassin. 
Yes, I'm trespassin', your ass I'm harassin', huh. 
Talk is cheap. I'm keepin' ya six feet deep, so don't sleep 
When I creep, you'll leap like athletes.

Knowledge is answered. 
You're just a Kit Kat, on some Tic-Tacs, but I'm a Big Mac, 'cause I'm G Rap. 
Fully equipped with a hip hop lip, my memory bank is like a microchip. 
My bass will give a shake, or if not quake, 
It'll make you, sucker MC, want to jump in the lake. 
'cause I'm murder, homi-cide, color. 
Must kill and destroy with excitement and drama. 
Weakest, I'll seek her, you become weaker. 
My art is the smoke, my materials and media. 
So rap alert for ya, devastate the area. 
I'll give a grain of your lyrical mania. 
Power source, and a G enforced, your headboards, and they could be rap wars. 
So come one or two, 'cept for a few. 
Doubles and couples and I'll grip 'em like tools.

'Cause I'm not the stranger, just the rhyme arranger. 
Highly explosive, keep out, danger. 
Packin' Gs while you try to beat me, 
But for these MCs who go on and wannabe Gs. 
What I write is in a smoking section; here's an injection of rap perfection. 
So what the heck, you select my dialect. 
Next man's cassette, yo, reject and eject. 
'Cause I could use a technique, smart as an antique. 
Beats that I repeat show you that I can speak 
Totally, probably, you rappers want to copy me. 
It takes strategy just like Monopoly. 
Figure it out: 
Cool G Rap is about makin' armies and crews look like Girl Scouts. 
'Cause when I start rappin', I keep the people clappin'.

Doin' some pickups deliveries and transportin' keys 
Yeah they got me like a flunkie 
I'm ridin' around with ten kilos inside my trunk G 
And I'm holdin' the suitcase 
With a half a million dollars right in my motherfuckin' face 
And I'm tryin' to ignore it 
But sometimes I get tempted to make a motherfuckin' run for it 
The thought alone makes me shiver damn 
What if I get caught? They'll find me floatin' in the Hudson river 
But if I escape, I'll be in shape for my life 
But they might, get my kid and my wife 
See I'm supposed to make a stop 
To an Uptown spot, run up the block and make another drop 
But I got somethin' else in mind 
'Cause I'm sick of puttin' my motherfuckin' ass on the line 
I got the money and the hit 
Went through the Brook nonstop cause I ain't droppin' off shit 
Then I thought of a plan 
So I droves to my house and got my girl and my little man 
C'mon bitch, pack the shit, get ready 
""God damn why your face all sweaty?"" 
Just hurry up and get the shit 
I'm a dead man bitch, understand, we gotta split 
I switched the locks on the door 
Started packin' like I was goin on a motherfuckin' world tour 
Grabbed my bags and my gun 
C'mon we gotta go I'm on the motherfuckin' run 

Now I'm drivin' and I'm lookin' at my passport 
I'm outta here soon as my ass hit the airport 
I loaded up the automatic 
I don't believe this shit, I'm stuck in motherfuckin' traffic 
I'm gettin' nervous as a fuck see 
A Lincoln Continental pullin' right up beside me 
Puts down my bitch and then I bent low 
Bullets are flying through my window 
The enemy is on attack 
Drew the nine and cocked the hammer and I fired at the bitches back 
I gotta take my respect 
My bullets hittin' Italian motherfuckers in the neck 
Looked at my bitch a bullet struck her 
Put in another clip, cause I ain't givin' up a motherfucker 
Niggaz runnin' up in trenches 
Sprayin' at my car, only missin' me by fuckin' inches 
Stepped on the gas pedal, how bad my bitch is harmed? 
Shit they only hit her in the fuckin arm 
Now I'm drivin' off sidewalks, makin' sharp turns 
My son is catchin' motherfuckin' heartburns 
I got the car shakin' wildly 
I made a turn, and then I dipped my shit into a dark alley 
They drove right past, now all this chasin' shit is done 
I'm on the motherfuckin' run 

The next thing I know, it was daylight 
And I been sleepin' in this motherfucker all night 
I started pullin' on my hoe 
""C'mon man what?"" Wake up bitch, we gotta go! 
Pulled out the alley, then I dipped 
Looked down and picked up the nine and put more rounds in the clip 
You know I'm headin' South no doubt 
And I don't give a fuck where, as long it's a hideout 
Finally we crossed the border, I pulled into a station 
To fill up the tank, and get a drink of water 
Pullin' over to park my ride 
That's when I noticed this limousine comin' up on my left side 
Then the sucker started rammin' me 
Then I looked, it was the Luciano family 
Looked at my bitch she started cryin', my finger on the trigger 
I pulled it bullets started flyin' 
Now I'm hittin' all them bastards 
I'm droppin' 'em fast, splashin' blood out niggaz asses 
Then I'm finally done and 
I took em all out, but I caught one in the stomach 
Now I'm lookin' for survivors 
So I ran up on the side of the car, and hit the driver 
And then I laid low 
The only motherfucker left was Don Luciano 
So I snuck up the sucker 
Put my gun to his head, ""Whassup now motherfucker?"" 
He said, ""Wait, I want to talk"" 
I put his brains on the sidewalk 
Another life I had to waste 
He fell on his back, and then I spit right in his guinea face

I stalk the New York sidewalk 
All the girls hawk but I don't stop to talk 
I keep stepping with a nine on my waistline 
Got sixteen shots and I don't waste mine 
Never fess cause I'm dressed with a bulletproof vest 
Try to test, I leave a bloody-ass mess 
Driving a Saab that connects with the mob 
Bank job, plenty niggers I rob 
Blood stains are on my Ballys 
A sucker got rowdy, so I shot him in an alley 
Pumped his face full of dumb-dums 
Then left him for the cast of rats and the bums 
Yo a lot of suckers hate me with a passion 
'Cause they know I can catch them one night and I ain't flashing

One in the head, making sure you don't get up 
This is what happens and nobody can't stop it

Streets are filled with brothers that kill like Illville 
They murdered before and they still will

For something he did, I didn't dig, the little pig 
Anyway I didn't have it 
In fact now the little faggot is crawling with maggots

Everybody's wearing gloves on their hand 
Strictly army suits and long black Timberland boots 
I want us all to roll like troops 
See now we get the roll on them 
'Cause the punk little sucker they shot up came and told on them 
I want him bagged them too 
'Cause ain't no telling of what he might do to my crew 
Shoot a sucker at point-blank range 
If he seems like he's acting strange 
Dump the chump chain, go straight for the green and the jewels 
And we can even take niggers' jewels 
Shoot to kill and don't leave no witness 
Survivors try to get live and get with this 
Snatch up the top man and start slapping him 
And put a cap in him and then start wrapping him 
Up and pass no time to shiver 
Stop on the bridge and deliver bodies into the river 
Next stop, blow away that pain-in-the-ass cop 
The one that keeps getting niggers knocked 
Put an end to his shit and he ain't about making collars 
The crooked-ass rookie wants dollars 
My man Ron's on the rooftop, waiting to snipe 
Two bullets went right through his windpipe 
Cold blooded, shot down taking his very last breath 
Left to bleed to death

I'm wanted dead or alive

Come in my face with the he say, she say 
And I'mma kick you up your ass like Pelé 
One night some kids went for broke 
And you can almost choke from the gunsmoke 
Somebody got robbed and got fed up 
So he set up the block to get wet up 
One kid got caught down a dead-end street 
Gunned him down from his head to his feet 
One brother got smoked in a car chase 
Through the windshield, a bullet in the face 
Left his head wide open like a basket 
Went to his funeral, shot up his casket

Now I'm drivin' and I'm lookin' at my passport
I'm outta here soon as my ass hit the airport
I loaded up the automatic
I don't believe this shit, I'm stuck in motherfuckin' traffic
I'm gettin' nervous as a fuck see
A Lincoln continental pullin' right up beside me
Puts down my bitch and then I bent low
breaking glass* bullets are flying through my window
The enemy is on attack
Drew the nine and cocked the hammer and I fired at the bitches back
I gotta take my respect
My bullets hittin' Italian motherfuckers in the neck
Looked at my bitch a bullet struck her
Put in another clip, cause I ain't givin up a motherfucker
Niggaz runnin' up in trenches
Sprayin' at my car, only missin' me by fuckin' inches
Stepped on the gas pedal, how bad my bitch is harmed?
Shit they only hit her in the fuckin' arm
Now I'm drivin' off sidewalks, makin' sharp turns
My son is catchin' motherfuckin' heartburns
I got the car shakin' wildly
I made a turn, and then I dipped my shit into a dark alley
They drove right past, now all this chasin' shit is done
I'm on the motherfuckin' run

The next thing I know, it was daylight
And I been sleepin' in this motherfucker all night
I started pullin' on my hoe
C'mon man what? wake up bitch, we gotta go!
Pulled out the alley, then I dipped
Looked down and picked up the nine and put more rounds in the clip
You know I'm headin' south no doubt
And I don't give a fuck where, as long it's a hideout
Finally we crossed the border, I pulled into a station
To fill up the tank, and get a drink of water
Pullin' over to park my ride
That's when I noticed this limousine comin' up on my left side
Then the sucker started rammin' me
Then I looked, it was the Luciano family
Looked at my bitch she started cryin', my finger on the trigger
I pulled it bullets started flyin'
Now I'm hittin' all them bastards
I'm droppin' 'em fast, splashin' blood out niggaz asses
Then I'm finally done and
I took em all out, but I caught one in the stomach
Now I'm lookin' for survivors
So I ran up on the side of the car, and hit the driver
And then I laid low
The only motherfucker left was Don Luciano
So I snuck up the sucker
Put my gun to his head, whassup now motherfucker?
He said, wait, I want to talk
*five gunshots* I put his brains on the sidewalk
Another life I had to waste
He fell on his back, and then I spit right in his guinea face
He saw the barrel of the devil's gun

People want to go fight for the white powder
People hanging in spots
They waited until the blocks got hot 
And got raided by the cops
I'll explain the man sleeping in the rain
His whole life remains inside a bottle of Night Train
Another man got his clothes in a sack
'Cause he spent every dime of his rent playing blackjack
And there's the poor little sister
She has a little baby daughter
Named Sonya, and Sonya has pneumonia
So why's her mother in a club unzipped though?
Yo, that's her job; Sonya's mommy is a bar stripper
Drug dealers drive around looking hard
Knowing they're sending their brothers and sisters to the graveyard
Every day is a main event; some old lady limps
The pushers and pimps eat shrimps
It gets tiring, the sight of a gun firing
They must desire for the sound of a siren
A bag lady dies in an alleyway
She's seen the last of her days inside the subways
More and more down the slope; the kid couldn't cope
So he stole somebody's dope and a gold rope
Now my son's on the run; he's a wanted one
Had fun then was done by a shotgun
Upstairs I cover my ears and tears
The man downstairs must have drank too many beers

Gambling spots, just a poor man's jackpot
You winning a lot, you get shot

Knowin goddamn well her boss is stickin dick up in her 
You press her for the sex and she front like she ain't with it 
And love to suck a muthafuckin dick, but won't admit it 
She'll tell you she first started havin sex when she got older 
Then throw her legs on your shoulders like she took up yoga 
And some bitches be burnin, you niggas know the half 
If you open up they pussy, you can see the movie 'Backdraft' 
She's waitin for you to stick your dick up in her cherry

Now your little white daughters suck our dick for us 
Spanish bitches wouldn't fuck nobody black and shit 
Until we started gettin paid from off this rappin shit 
Now they suckin on our dicks and callin us papi chulo

Puertorican men get mad when niggas fuck they women 
Can't stand the sight of seein a black dick goin up in em 
But I ain't with discrimination, that's that wack shit 
I could care less if you was purple and fuckin a black bitch 
So if she lets your ass, go 'head and get some sex from her 
God gave her the pussy, she can sleep with whoever the fuck she want to 
The first time I saw some niggas with some chinese bitches 
I asked myself a question: where the fuck they find these bitches? 
But then I had to learn that the money talks 
And when your ass is broke, any honey walks 
But fuck a hindu bitch, no, I won't be in a hurry

I be funky to a junkie cause the rhyme is dope 
I use my microphone wire like a cowboy rope 
So I can lasso any rapper that think they can cope 
And the microphone is my horror scope 
Magnificient and excellent cause I'm no scrub 
I could rock in a club with only one light bulb 
All I need is a mic and a crowd to react 
And I'll turn a damn jam into Radio Shack 
All suckers in a place I'll erase and replace 
Just in case you want to copy and trace 
My word is superb, intoxicates like herb 
Orally, musically, and mentally disturbed 
Soundwaves are outrageous 
I'm brave and courageous 
Fillin up pages for ages and ages 
Released to rock, too acquiesced to shock 
All biters get writer's block 
When it's rhyme tyme 

To play this game you gotta be a rap pro 
It's not dominos or tic tac toe 
It's the rhyme tyme game, it challenges the brain 
Strategy is the key to unlock the chain 
My lips do not chat when I start to rap 
Project my voice so loud, my tonsils flat 
Excellence defense on the phonograph 
Is DJ Polo, he's cooler than Shaft 
Fresher than a item that you find inside a deli 
Fatter than the man that they call the Fonzarelli 
Colder than a icey, hotter than chili 
Rap in every language, I can say it in Suaheli 
My body has a flavor, girls says I'm lickable 
Daffy Duck-MC's call it despicable 
I say it's similar to fat, incredible 
I got a taste, but it's not edible 
I'm goin' down as a MC champ 
Kinda wet on the set, but it's just damp 
Some day you'll see my face on a US stamp 
Like Evil Knievel I jump and I ramp 
In my rap I'm like an other Johnny Dangerously 
I can do two things simultaneously 
I can rap real fast and speed it up, and not a word you'll miss 
I can slow - down - at - times - just - like - this 
I can rap, stop - start it again 
Then count to ten 
With a 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 
So there, my friend 
I can box, do karate, or even do judo 
Rap in spanish, but I'm not Menudo 
Ask me why I classify 
My rhymes will terrify 
It's rhyme tyme 

Now I could rap to your sister 
Or rap a tongue twister 
Those who want to bite it, it makes your lip blister 
Cause I'm the guidin light, I recite on the mic 
For parasites who bite it's gonna be frightnight 
Mighty microphone phantom, my rhymes are fiery 
Because of biters I write em in my diary 
So don't dare, my idea is ideal 
Polo is on the wheels of steel for real 
??? this division the like micanician 
What I wrote is voted unanymous decision 
Eardrums are struck when he conducts a cut 
If a sucker deejays, he gives an uppercut 
Just like a dog cool G Rap will train 
Every bitin MC that went insane 
At the top I will maintain 
I'm not a lamebrain 
I leave a bloodstain to show I give pain 
Not a skinny dipper, a fat rolly-polly 
My hair is very curly, it's like a ravioli 
I'm very good at physic, and also scientific 
My rappin has a meanin just like a hieroglyphic 
The rhyme is very hot, you gotta blow on it to bite it 
Sometimes I just recite it, but usually I write it 
Girls make me grow just like Pinocchio 
Before the show I go: ""Geronimo!"" 
Makin a video inside the studio 
Never had the chicken pocks, the measels, mumps or polio 
And you'll be sorry when you bite what I create 
You say to yourself: ""i shoulda had a v-a""

We all gonna do just one part
Because you know, we came a long way
You know, from back in Martin Luther King days, Malcolm X
[Ain't hard to tell] You know, now now that we see
Nelson N-Nelson Mandela's free
We gonna talk about this, is e gonna talk about this racism
Stop that, you know what I'm sayin', we gonna stop that
So G, why don't you just do your rhymin' part, and then I'll come on after you

I'm tryin' hard to explore, I'm not sure
What all the racial war for
It's makin' me more sore
I walk through a color blind corridor
Seekin', for peace in the people I'm meetin'
Black white and Puerto-Rican men are greetin' each other
Just like brothers, there's plenty and many of others
You can discover, kids fathers and mothers
A meltin' pot, no one felt they got prejudice
Listen I could never assist someone diss this
A landscape, with a dark and a light handshake
Havin' fun, without one bein a fake snake
So let's form a rainbow over the mountain
And let's drink from the same water fountain
Let's make our Earth Day a story of
People that walk through the same territories
Color or creed, is no need for a man to bleed
I believe, we all breathe the same seed
Unless it's diluted, for somethin' to intrude it
Then I see your family tree was uprooted
So don't be foolish if you're Jewish or Hindu
The racial manual is the evil that men do
I was raised in a nation of Asian
Hate shouldn't separate Jamaican from Haitian
So if you're givin' in your ears I hope your hear me and
Siberian's no better than Nigerian
I bring a rattle to a battle that you see me in
I'm no villain so why would I be killin' Indians

And yo a prejudiced man is of a devil mentality
These are words of a wise man, wisdom

Kool G Rap & DJ Polo,"When I was five years old I realized there was a road
At the end I will win lots of pots of gold
Never took a break, never made a mistake
Took time to create cause there's money to make
To be a billionaire takes hard work for years
Some nights I shed a tear while I said a prayer
Been through hard times, even worked part time
In a Key Food store sweeping floors sometimes
I was sort of a porter taking the next man's orders
Breaking my back for a shack from headquarters
All my manpower for four bucks an hour
Took my time and wrote rhymes in the shower
Shoes are scuffed cause the road gets rough
But I'mma rock it cause my pockets ain't stuffed enough
All the freaks wouldn't speak cause my checks were weak
They would turn the other cheek so I started to seek
A way to get a play, and maybe one day
I'll be performing up a storm for a decent pay
No matter how it seems, I always kept the dream
All the girlies screamed and suckers get creamed
Dreamed about it for five years straight
Finally I got a break to cut my first plate
The road ain't yellow and it ain't no witches
My name is Kool G Rap, I'm on the road to the riches

I used to stand on the block selling cooked up rock
Money busting out my sock cos I really would clock
They were for kind of fiends bringing jackets and jeans
Magazines, anything, just to hustle for beans
The cash was coming fast, money grew like grass
People hungry for the blast that don't even last
Didn't want to be involved but the money will get ya
Gettin richer and richer, the police took my picture
But I still supplied, some people I knew died
Murders and homicides for bottles of suicide
Money, jewelry, living like a star
And I wasn't too far from a Jaguar car
In a small-time casino, the town's Al Pacino
For all of the girls, the pretty boy Valentino
I shot up stores and I kicked down doors
Collected scars from little neighborhood wars
Many legs I broke, many necks I choked
And if provoked I let the pistol smoke
Loyal members in a crew now down with the game
Selling nickels and dimes in sunshine or rain
What I had was bad from my shoes to my pad
In the first time in my life loaning money to dad
Now the table's turned and my lifestyle switches
My name is Kool G Rap, I'm on the road to the riches

A thug will mugs for drugs, he eventually bugs
Looking for crack on carpets and rugs
The squealers tells but the dealer still sells
Little spoiled kids inheriting oil wells
I was the type on the opposite side
Of smoking the pipe, in a beef I got hype
Cause rags to riches switches men to witches
Become stitches, body bags in ditches
Bloodshed, I painted the town red
People fled as I put a dread's head to bed
That means dead, in other words deceased
Face got erased, bullets got released
Bombs were planted and kids were kidnapped
In fact this was a way to get back
At enemies who tried to clock G's
On my block, now they forever knock Z's
Plans of rampages went for ages
Some got knocked and locked inside cages
Some bit the dust for crumbs and crusts
In God we trust, now rots to rust
Bust caps to cops, policeman drops
You blew off his top when the pistol went pop
Troopers, soldiers, rolling like boulders
Eyes of hate and their hearts get colder
Some young male put in jail
His lawyer so good his bail is on sale
Looking at the hourglass, how long can this power last
Longer than my song but he already fell
He likes to eat hearty, party
Be like John Gotti, and drive a Maserati
Rough in the ghetto, but in jail he's Jello
Mellow, yellow fellow, tell or hell, hello
One court date can turn an outlaw to an inmate
But just stay, ship him upstate by the Great Lakes
And than a-wait and wait and wait
Until he breaks, that's all it takes
So he fakes to be a man, but he can't stand
On his own two feet because now he's in a new land
Rules are different and so is life
When you think with a shank, talk with a knife
Not my lifestyle so I made a U-turn
More money I earn, more money to burn
Pushing all buttons, pulling all switches
My name is G Rap, I'm on the road to the riches",Road to the Riches,2000
Kool G Rap & DJ Polo,"It's a demo

People in the audience Kool G Rap is my name
I write rhymes and insert them inside your brain
And DJ Polo, the man I'm behind
He operates the turntables when I'm rocking my rhymes, see

It's a demo

Psychopath on the phonograph, nut of the cuts
You heard the boy slice, is he nice or what?
He's the main entertainer inside the show
And he goes by the name of DJ Polo, see

It's a demo

I supply the data, he's the wheel operator
We're walking tall and we're called The Terminators
I'm Kool G Rap, and he's Polo
He cuts like a pro when I go solo
He's a record spinner winner, that you can bet
Eats DJ's for dinner on his table set
With cuts he concocts and the party rocks
DJ's want to Xerox it out the box
A professional performer, wheels of steel trainer
One hundred percent excellent entertainer
The maker and creator of the lyrical line
Idea of Shakespeare, the mind of Einstein
Surrender, pretender, you don't exist
As a vocalist, so you can kiss this
I'm Kool G Rap, greatest of all times
And you can see it, inside my rhymes
See it's a demo

It's a demo

My recital will form a musical brainstorm
Powerful sound waves where ear drums are torn
The performer recites, competitors ignite
Audiences tonight I came to incite
Fascinating results, a defeat will be difficult
Equivalent to a thousand volts
To my brief rap speech you attach like a leech
Examine when I'm jamming and when I preach
Before I'm completed, you will all be deleted
You said I sucked, instead I succeeded
Fan fascinator, I supply data
According to the groove, I'm a real smooth operator
I activate a musical device
Dialogues are concise, no need to splice
My system contains musical rap rain
Instrumentals inserted inside your brain
All levels rate low with a medium tempo
I give a dramatical cameo show
And now you know DJ Polo
These party people are ready to go
See it's a demo

It's a demo

Better than a Snicker when it comes to a snack
I go solo with Polo when I'm in combat
I'm the MC humanoid and I just get annoyed
Boy you'll be destroyed cause you copy like a Polaroid
Coming like a meteor inside any area
Make the people merrier, vicious like a terrier
Like a terrorist, I will terrorize
Telling any territory I'm a glory enterprise
The microphone fanatic, cause I'm the Asiatic
Brotherman from the motherland, rappers automatic
Ly suffer as I suffocate, then I start to alienate
Make you an inmate, so you cannot retaliate
Mutilate at a rate to penetrate you
No other crew can rescue
My talents are balanced my audience is silent
MC's stop biting or I'll get violent
It's a demo

It's a demo

I take a scene to the extreme
To the climax and those who sleep will have a wet dream
So don't even quote what you write is dolt
Your rhymes are small-time through a microscope
More cooler than an Ice Ages
Biters, let the effective students walk through my white pages
Different stages of rage that I'm going through
And like an owl, you'll know who to
Feed your greed, you want and need
The rhymes that you carefully read, but your eyes bleed
Cause my fury is scary
And if you bite, you'll be leaving all your teeth for the Tooth Fairy
Go ahead and dare me, if you think I'm joking or playing
When you're feeling what I'm saying, you'll be kneeling and praying
Then I release steam like a radiator
And attack MC's like a gladiator
As my talent proceeds to grow, yo
This ain't the end of the show, it's a demo

Kool G Rap & DJ Polo,"This is poison so be alert and cautious
Those who act courageous you will get nauseous
Infected or contaminated
Turn on your stereo never come radio-activated
Deadly and fatal, poison the title
My recital hits the parts that are vital
So tune in the tone of beats and poems
Polo's headphones becomes a skull and crossbones
Pull out your Q-tips, clean out the earwax
If you're still hard of hearing
I'mma scrub them with Ajax
With maximum drum so behave and remember
You're a slave to my sound wave
Faster rhymes I mastermind I have to find
A new method time after time
Write a rhyme quick when I pull out my Bic pen
Stick to an idea, the soundproof slick then
Put it on paper cause I make you hyper
Than any other rapper cause I keep my rapping riper
Like cherries or some say berries
Mandatory for the auditorium's glory
Here's the story: rappers getting leery to hear me
G speaks in a new technique of fury
Combination of drums and noise and
Yo yo yo Polo yo this is poison

Poison!

Look-alikes on the mic you should get off
You're a rip-off, I'mma rip up, get
Rid of, cause you bit off
Bite off, ate off. Imitate off
They get paid off for G Rap to get laid off
Get up and sit up the butterer and buttercup
Male or female shut them up, Polo shut her up

Yo, you heard what he said shut the hell up, man

Yeah, hide my line as you pick them up
Rob me blind of my rhymes you might as
Well have said: ""stick 'em up.""
Letters of metaphor matters to
Better the fatter your pocket
Rhymes blast off like rockets
Rhymes will be replaced and beats erased
In case a rapper tries to trace hardcore bass
Made in a minute the sky is the limit
For reaching the goal and the dream
Wouldn't you want to be in it to win it?
Biters are wanted like animals hunted
Soon as I get them I hit them I done it
To the suckers who fronted
The rappers who made it and did it
Forget about winning the battle cause
I'mma shake rattle and roll
A little something for girls and boys and
Yo yo Polo my man yo this is poison

Read the label sucker
P-O-I-S-O-N yeah, Poison

Poison!

A mind designed to find a rhyme that's right on time
One step beyond and not behind the line
That separates dogs from divine
Take it as a caution, or a warning sign
Whether antonyms, words I'm blending them
Homonyms, synonyms, good like M&M's
With Polo and while he's slicing
I'll turn the mike's last name into Tyson
My brain is like a factory constantly creating
Material stitch by stitch for decoration
Lyrics are fabrics, beat is the lining
My passion in rhyming is fashion designing
Now it gets odd it, cause people want to sport it
You bought it, if you didn't then you couldn't afford it
Poetry full of surprises, it's like a game show
And my brain glows just like a rainbow
Rappers and poets they already know it
G Rap is a terror not a error and never
Will I stop reaching for better
Whether wheels of steel or reel to reel
G Rap will make you feel the real deal
I usually rap hardcore and I know
That y'all thinking am I somehow semi, so
We yell ""party"" and girls and boys and

Kool G Rap & DJ Polo,"She tossed the flamer '94 walked into danger
Behind the wall fought with a banger
Trapped in the beast, gas released, a rat deceased
Back on the street, back on her feet
Clappin' the heat

She's dressed to kill
Iced-out head to toe, a snake in black
She's cleared, to, get ill
She's about the dough, the black widow

Yo, she was a tight bird, female version of Iceberg
To put in the right words
Played the right curves, beige and white birds
The type she served it was quite superb
Ran through the city in a white suburb
Lived in a predominantly white suburb
She liked the herb, rockin' all the richest type of furs
Make your life submerge if you strike a nerve
Dough she like to splurge
Shine of her light blurs from off her finger
Honey was off the ringer, the way she tossed the flamer
'94 walked into danger, behind the wall fought with a banger
Trapped in the beast, gas released, a rat deceased
Back to the street, back on her feet
Clappin' the heat, from the back seat, in back of a jeep
Stackin' the heat, pilin' the ones
Made her point when violence was brung
Regulated and balanced the slums
Brought in a cat with a talent for guns
Click quick to silence a Dunn
Convoys of black limos
Employs strapped with mack millos
Bustin' off caps through a cracked window, that's the MO
Push your wig back, make you a black Leno
The feds on her tracks got the phones tapped for info
Tryin' to map the dividend flow, and where the ends go
Checkin' on whose name the Benz go
Who pushes the buttons when Mac-10's blow
A rose on a black satin pillow
The silhouette of her web, killin' for blood spill, a black widow

[Chorus]
She's (out for blood) dressed (for the kill) to kill (bustin' slugs)
Iced-out (shit is real) head (livin' crime) to toe (life of crime)
A snake (droppin' heads) in black (pullin' nines)
She's cleared (dodgin' heat) to (play the street)
Get ill (let the guns blow, had to eat)
She's about (copped the raw) the dough (went to war)
The black widow (beef no more, cold fours at your door)

She was married but four times a widow
The fifth time ditto, kiddo
Step out of line, kitko, she spit nines and shi-dells
Put a pound to the tip of your niddose
Put em in line piddles
Diamond-stud shinin' the clito', the web spinnin'
With bloodstains soaked in the bed linen
Spread venom, known for bustin' the lead grinnin', tilted red brimmin'
Makin' the lights inside of your head dimmin'
Givin' head to men and, leave a knife in they chest with a red ribbon
Bread to swim in, foes get left deader than Lennon
Threads of linen, sippin' gin with a shread of lemon
Dead-up thoroughbred, slim and trim and stackin cake like Emminger's
Under the down coat brown coat like cinnamon
She went to have the Benjamins, for that she injure men
Send a squad to go and injure men that injure men
On top of that she popular, hit the opera
Francis Ford Coppola, mezzanine she's with binoculars
You even think about poppin' her, stoppin' her, moppin' her, droppin' her
Hard with bodyguards divin' on top of her
Cops in they Blu-Blockers watchin' her, steady clockin her
Jock her, dreamin' of knockin' her, thinkin' a scheme for knockin' her
Dress provocative, show the cleavage between her knockers
Bust a sock off with a blocker to rasta inside her locker
She cover the bills though, restaurant delicatessen Armadillo
White Willow, strike of the black widow

[Chorus]

She held a white weddin'
Type settin' just like a sight from heaven
Spend twice the bread'n from her last rice on her head'n
All types of presents, striking presence
Bodyguards ready to light they weapons, ignite the Wessons
Refuse to live the life of a peasant
Days and nights was right and type pleasant
At the foot of the aisles, took vows
With all the criminals and crook pals
That put smiles on niggaz' necks while they look foul
Piles of cops peepin' her central book files
Beef them niggaz cook wild, groom lookin shook style
Forced into marriage, horse and a carriage
Remember lifespan shorter than average, lady boss flossin her carats
Dreams to get rich and perish in Paris
Cherish the cabbagem, makin' her path out of the church passage
Thugs they do they dirt massive
Skirt slashed, first class, Doni Amberg glasses
Flirt with her lashes
Snapshots, smirk for the flashes
Plots to leave her murked in the masses
Two killin' experts on the grasses
Put in they Tec work for the cashes
Leave the Earth hurt with a passion
Two louds shots burstin' in action
Made her head jerk from the blastin
Lady down, holdin' her shirt gaspin', hit by another turf assassin
Reason not even worth askin; the facts are real, though
Got her cap peeled for stackin' real dough
Lifestyle brillo when you're rollin' for krill dough

Blown out your shoes and your fabrics
With Jakes searchin' for clues and maggots
My crew is savage, we carry no dead weight
Bet they hide you when I slide kid
All my tools is packaged, and lose you faggots
Stay coppin' them jewels with karats, so who's the rabbit
Trix are for kids, in the buggy eye six on the strip
Strictly for big wigs, so tell me what this is
A nigga that's bout his biz, a nigga that don't forgive
A nigga that don't renege, a nigga that bust a cig, rupture your ribs
Front and I'll bring it to you 'xactly where you live
BGF surround the crib, throw a pound to the kid
Hit a fry when the good die young

[Chorus]

Yo it's a whole city of animals
Cannibals, bloodthirsty niggaz that hammer you
And handle you, shots makin you flammable
That's what an evil man's plan'll do
Vandal you, candle you, dismantle you
Leavin' your fam and crew, pan a few blocks
Bodies in camera view, for a grand or two
Land you on channel two
When niggaz can't eat, that's what the fam'll do
Leave you for the mantle, examine you
For the van to come transfer you
Too late to bandage you, too much damage to you
The coroners know how to manage you
Down in they land they planted you
That's what the cannons do, forever branded you
Spare cannoned you, abandoned you, rock you to sleep
Niggaz surrounded you, death wish granted you, fan at you
Went to my hundred shot clip when they flip and throw a grand at you
Peel your shit open like a can of brew
Then they work from the mandible, havin' you livin' where the salmon do
The good die young, redrum, who left to take a stand for you

[Chorus]

You cock a hot bet (?) and catch a popped vessel
And shot vestibule; you got testicles
Beef bring a nigga get shot visible
Rock with the best of you; then it's back to the block
The blacktops we open up shop and clock decimals
Fake cops, scrape from the teeth hot for residue
The foul slang liver(?) page, reach for that shit on your waist
Every killer in the place get hit in the face
Turn around, simmer down nigga, get in the safe
What you fear when the shots is blowin; shed a tear for the one
that caught one under the ear inside of his top popped open
It's death for all niggaz that left with the glock smokin
Came in with hot toast and left the whole spot soakin'
Fuck y'all niggaz not knowin', we make your seeds stop growin'
Guerilla nigga, we keep rhymes flowin'
Bust a four pound, man down, found in the lot swollen
Drama brung, all inside the slum, the good die young

We mob in it, fake niggaz dissolve in minutes

In real life this is how the dogs do it

Two violent niggaz sit at the round table, in brown sables
Chains hangin down to the navel

Hold the four-pound stable

Get put in the dirt like ground cable
Found from bloodhound nasals
Or deep in the river get found naval
That shit why'all spit sound fable
""American Me"" style, knife in the anal; who 'round to save you?
I leave you from waist down disabled
Face split like a round bagel
Found in a hospital gown witcha crown stapled
Wrong one to tangle with, a gym star, spangle your shit
Use your handkerchief to strangle your bitch
Single niggaz out on the strip and bang in a clip
Slugs from a Desert Eagle mingle the click
A force of habit, for me to let it rip across your attic
Never violent with a silent but I toss your cabbage

Planted ever so soft and gentle but die viciously
Hours of torture, before the torture apply misery
Days before I feel pity to give a guy liberty
Seen him, his pants shitty and eyes all glittery
I'll die a rich man before the FBI figure me
Forty stories up, inside a high rise in Italy
No hidden forces, only natural courses deliver me
Gray hairs from the great years, fears never shiver me
Reminscin', how we car-bombed ignitions
Of politicians, judges strong-armed to listen
Men turnin' up dead, or hurt harmed and missin'
Bulletproof cars are driven, Teflon edition
Bodies cut up in large chunks, thrown in car trunks
Music inside the bar stunk
Gettin' surrounded by bitches blowin' cigars drunk
One of my stonefaced goons'll make your heart pump
Electrocution with cables that make the car jump
The yard punks, that sinned with a life sentence for sellin' hard junk
The family, the whole commission
Has been around since the days before prohibition (no doubt)
Mathematics was good then, the slow addition
Some overdosed down a coke slope, a dope addiction
Lookin' back on them days, I ran a whole division
Some of the Jake and the state was tryin' to throw the mission
They caught a ticket ride to hell with no admission; beyond these tracks
A life of networkin', sippin' bourbon and cognac

For the family will, mansion and hot wheels in Amityville
Treat a snitch nigga like Sam when he squeal
Break the code of silence, just hand me the steel
For every wrong done, a man'll be killed, there's plans to rebuild
Curtains and drapes, got these Jakes tryin' to can me for real
Until then, be in the backyard with clam on the grill
Or catch me laid up in the canopy ill
With two mamis handin' me thrills; Vivica Fox body Vanity grills
Rubberbandin' these bills; tryin' to duck the fame and the glamor
Tryin' to stay from out the range of the scanners
Not tryin' to get my frame in the camera
Avoid tabloids and front pages
Bums get knocked off and bumped for favors
Collect Trump papers with pumps and gauges
Royale suites when I bunk in Vegas
Got homicide searchin' the city dump for neighbors
Pinky ring with a chunk of glacier
Copped a spot with a bunch of acres
Some of them got they bodies slumped for capers
Barcaleo hat, ducks and gators
Got a crib full of housemaids, butlers and waiters

We gon' rock until we jackpot, fuck them haters

You want my digits?  I'm with it (take it)
You could ring me up whenever; whatever's clever (One time)

Stroll your way; you know you want me (Bo!) 
So bring your game over here to the bar 
You know you want to sit and hang with the star 
Maybe get a new house, and a brand, new, car! (a-hah-hah)

I be the receiver, of strange mind patterns
No type of compassion, endless my though process
hits like a dark cavern, I was bred of toxic parents
embryonic stages underdeveloped fetal pages that I burnt like phasers
Releasing human excrements on you like Tawana Brawley
Thinking to myself like Pee Wee Herman caught jerking off
I wish nobody saw me, wishing I could hide vibe cool Keith we spark

We step on stage MC's disappear like the rain forest
So when I rocks again get oxygen get cameras on
No telling diverse curse selling I'm reversed like Hammer son
Mental capacity, hindered like I'm Forrest Gump
Bu-dump, for your trunk
Get you hooked like crack hooked Humpty Hump
I catch the *real* with more sick humor than Benny *Hill*

Funky sex man naked, foresmith is bound to shoot the gift
Riff riff raff, rappers make me giggle giggle laugh
From the East coast to Texas, I kick a rhyme like Pele
Strolling knee deep, you take a peep, while my beeper beep
Catchin wreck one two one two achoo achoo achoo
Sneezing and pleasing, on your ear, verbal easing
Chocolate flows then drips down through your nose
Between your legs, I bend your head with beer kegs
True, I'm blue, the smith can't stick to doo-doo
Yo Chino we needle we brown with the King Crown
Rockin underground bound, and pullin girls panties down
Yo check it, yo step with, you puppet muppet nitwit
Energizing like forty volts, I'm shocking to your anal
With my goggles paisano, Spiderman against the Rhino
Leaping on your building, downtown Los Angeles
Skandalous man, shooting sperm in your perm
Leaving ways to dry, my urine dropping in your eye
Burning afro puffs, with that greasy sticky stuff
I get rough, and plant my seed into your rectum
Masterbating at warp speed, I pull up in your spectrum

You holding back on the feeble, small weasel
No handicap love, elephants on the fence
Ever since dinosaurs, people stood on Crenshaw
And palace fade shopping lades, you never saw before
Bouncing down with more bounce, with music by the ounce
With my finger between the mean California labia

Walkin around  I see youse about to lose her 

That honey with white boots  and hair like Medusa 

Brown-skin fine, I drink her body like wine 

and throw the wax on it, and watch two cheeks shine 

I drunk a forty, I'm up in here feelin naughty 

I like the go-go girl, go 'head work it shorty 

I got no time to trick, on the average girl 

I'm in paradise, caught up, in the booty world 

And for you regular honies, tryin to play fly 

I ain't no Chemical no Bank in your human eye 

I like my spot, everybody's butt naked 

Pump with G-strings, watchin hot momma shake it

I slipped in my Tipton, bonin sweetie look like Yo-Yo 

She had a good time, knees bent in the chair 

She said, ""Get wild - I like it when you pull my hair"" 

I gave her cream, and rubbed it on her black boots 

I see a packed house in different color body suits 

I'm in the front row, chillin on the down low 

Checkin her dogstyle, she's ??

She's on the job right, cutiepie sippin Tango 

I gotta peel for real, a hundred dollar bill 

I'm comin straight up, and not for a breakfast meal 

This ain't no Burger King, this ain't no White Castle 

Not like some ugly girls in Bentleys tryin to give a hassle 

I like the slot machine, bustin nuts mean 

Slippery wet lubrication like Valvoline 

I'm pullin nylon, yo dead up G, to the side 

Feelin soft flesh, I'm hard, I'ma let her ride 

Jump up and down, get live like House of Pain 

Leavin em so wet, the silk with a tan stain 

I reach a climax, she's happy with her orgasms

Show these sheisty people  the sawed off  the pump is real 
Then smack niggaz when they don't feel Keith's right direction 
Put niggaz in fear  the bullets in they head section 
Pick up drug dollars  leave rings around niggaz collars 
Front me cash  you catch them bodies  put em in a stash 
Never laugh at you  explain plans  what to do 
Machine guns on tour, pajama for your soft crew 
Don't step to me with shit the candle wax is gettin lit 
I'm solo now, and still money I have to fuckin split 
Business ain't straight in glamour world, fuckin hellgate 
All these things I been through, your skull deserves a metal plates 
Not the platinum plaque, just gun staples in your back 
Hung from a tree with rusty nails in your rectum crack

Where? .. IN YOUR FACE! (In yo' face)

For everybody a problem manager 
30% get my photo session ready, songs to the fuckin president 
I been spendin my ASCAP, waitin out there brain-walkin 
up with hit records on feet, in the fuckin rain 
Through merry-go-rounds, past politic circus 
Then shift flop first, and now it's time that you work this 
Suck my ass, we pass on acts if you think they good 
Niggaz ain't platinum, they album still, went barely wood 
I bring your ? down, samples now you have to clear it 
Niggaz talkin shit like lyric records, I ain't tryin to hear it 
Even if I'm deaf no mouth, one fuckin ear left 
You think they worth investments, hold your fuckin breath 
You might as well bite Kane, Rakim, study G. Rap 
I got some new shit, mental secrets for yo' asscrack 
Let me get real, before that ass breach that contract 
I got witnesses watchin, statements over budget 
Don't try to hide behind that fuckin mask now 
Throw the pistols away, and hide the shit in the grass now

Extortion is over, I cock back, you lose your fuckin job 
Two years of my time is precious in my kid's mind 
With child support, I drag your coffins in the court 
We even Steven, fuck that, my time and rent is short 
I've been writin songs, I'm calm, I'm a good sport 
One year has gone by, with tecs jam up in your eye 
I'm on some clever shit, fuck it man, go 'head lie 
I wake up six o'clock with triggers cocked every morning 
I'm no joke, you're bound to smell the fragrant gunsmoke

Yeah, I must show up, scope the cheeks well with clientele 
When a sister wants to see me, I should not really tell 
I bought some movies, some strippin' joint type of coolies 
Boots and thongs, girls flip on my theme songs 
They know I damage, with gloves my equipment's on 
I got a cape, like Superman, I'ma put it on 
Grab the Vaseline, make your hiney shine like Mr. Clean 
With a purple G-string, you want to do your own thing 
Girls dance for me, pumpin' over me

Bring five freaks that's ready to do this 
Aight, let me just see, I'll be down in a minute 

Late night, me Trev and Keith, leave the suite 
Three limos deep, with honies greet us downstairs 
Prepared to take us, anywhere, tonight's the Grammy's 
After party back at the hotel, we're poppin' expensive Perignon 
I'm the suave Don, this is the average evening 
Of the celebrities, the days are relaxed 
It would seem to most, an expensive vacation package 
The pay is good, in Hollywood 
A hustler has to mack in fresh gear, my choise of Rolls Royce 
And a duplex location up at Sunset and LaBrea 
I'm mackin' in your area

Yeah.. so you called me last night 

You was kinda confused huh? 

You didn't know what to do 

All excited over these football players and baseball players 

Whassup? You lookin for a million dollars or somethin? 

Man you kinda confused 



Freak mode! I'ma have sex  so let em feel 

Touch my private  my thing made of steel 

Shootin gizm  she ride like a Geo Prism 

I'm out in Cali  San Bernardino Valley 

I'm on the hill, not North in Peteskill 

Big Willie servin, now tell me how you femmes feel 

I'm in the Cadillac, drivin in a droptop 

People don't know my style, watch when they heads bop 

I'm on the highway, girls pull em down my way 

Credit cards and checks, man she get paid on Friday 

The woman's out, the Phantom pushin more clout 

I'm watchin ? with Sam, drinkin Guinness Stout 

Bourban booze, green alligator shoes 

Union commissioned sex, government intelligence 

What you see girl, that Benz is irrelevant 

Materialistic, ugly man is plastic 

No class, in a suit, cost rather cheap 

Got the nerve to blow the horn and he try to beep 

Interfere, in my spot, and he's comin here 

She's in the white boots, breathin in my ear

No affections, condom style, I got no yeast 

Worldwide trunk funk, no jazz on the East 

Breakin honies down, mackin here to Petersberg 

Virginia Slim, turn the freaks out in Lynchburg 

With brown bootie, Joe Smith, hit from Pittsburgh 

The right player, even if I choose odds 

Let me shuffle jackpots, women pick the cards 

Your hydraulic butt, bounce like a six-trey 

I'm on the case, jealous man steppin in my way 

Hot pursuit, why she play herself? Get the boot 

Actin like Troop, he say he signed with a group 

He wrote for Babyface, did songs, toured with Snoop 

.. lyin to you to get thrilled 

Droppin them old lines, his breath smell like doodoo 

I got a style if a brother want to know 

Smokin that stink blunt, you still sniffin blow 

Nose runnin on time with green slime 

Step in the club, I throw urine on your mind 

Big Luciano, diamond rings on the grand piano 

Girls flock and guys hop on the other jock 

I'm in a two-door, with bass comin through your block 

Sound kicks, I got the fly broads in the mix 

California butt, MC's suckin more what 

Like Gerald Levert, you try to make it work 

Jheri Curl Jones, spendin cash on a skirt 

Plan to win, whassup with Uncle Ben? 

Brother is sly, fatback bacon 

Still fakin, his voice chords achin 

You know I'm perplex, exotic on Ampex 

Dogstyle champ, hittin booty for butt sex 

I can't disguise myself like Michael Jackson 

The flasher, are you ready for action?

I got a summons, my clothes is off, I'm butt-naked 

in a discotechque, don't tell me ladies can't take it 

Just to have my drawers in a overcoat 

My El Dorado lean, the black Caddy float 

down the hill with Frankie Dolla Bill 

Honies in red zone, tell me how them drawers feel 

Suckin on the hippie, on the Mississippi 

Econo Lodge, a cheap way to get a quickie 

Five and five, equal ten 

Add twenty up, I'm back in the spot again 

Blowin it up, I drop my own bomb 

Two big green mitts, and tails on my arm 

You in my way my man, yo be	 excuse me 

I didn't call your girl, why accuse me? 

I think you're insecure, not sure 

if your girlfriend's home, if she's knockin at my door 

Back in your ride, no apartment, no place to wash 

You can't clean, tell em black 

He don't know yet, my discipline, how to act 

Stack with fume, and twenty-four flicks 

You can't win, takin shots like the Knicks 

I'm old enough with skills to be your daddy 

Go ask grandma, your freaky Aunt Sally 

Pretty woman standin there with her ugly man 

I don't want to shake his hand

Kool Keith,"Yeah  cool Keith should keep it real 
He should rap about space and Mars... 
 
Yo  I'm tired of looking at everybody. Same boots, skully hats in 
90 degree weather looking to get into clubs for free. I'm not 
smoking blunts or looking for jazz records at the Roosevelt. 

I left New York the city itself was stress depression 
High boots and urban beats  that wasn't my direction 
Producers filtering join in with R&B 
A million rappers, some clones trying to sound like me 
Biting my space styles, biting my horror-core 
All I saw was cool Keiths on my thaw 
Record companies had G'd-off all my royalties 
Watching vinyl spin, local groups' wack MC's 
Some try to rap with that perpetrate mobster crap 
Karl Kani jeans, fat stomachs in the limousines 
Mixtapes by wack DJs adds doo doo play 
I'm on the turnpike, the city drifting down the highway 
Like a mirage, the style there is all illusion 
On videos out of town, peoples buy confusion 
Rolling high with cash pulled over down my eye 
Since I've been out, y'all can't see 

[Chorus:]
Is the world made of plastic? 
Is the city buried in dreams? (Yeah) 
Is the world made of plastic? 
Cause that's the way is seems (Owww) 

Watching TV so bored, while imbeciles hold the mic cord 
Graffiti playgrounds are played out, yo how'd that sound? 
Army fatigues are weak, is for the minor leagues 
No rapping cyphers or brothers in the rented Benz 
Crews on stage, acting hard with a thousand friends 
I saw the place turn plastic, crackers looping beats 
People with no deals, walkmen rappin' on the streets 
I turned my back, 90% of the city sounded wack 
Payola scams switched DJ's like a rubber band 
Everybody clear with beats trying to be Premier 
Clearing samples, your SP-12 fake examples 
My money grows with green from my own label 
While you act rich with no cash on the bigger label 
Your tri-state ways are shut down by barricades 
In fact I packed my bags, and listened to E-40 
Mac Mall, see-Bo, and other rappers you don't know 
You're narrow-minded and styles of mind you won't find it 
My sound proceeds with moog and undertone bass 
No comic gimmicks with beats rapping in my face 
I come back real, solid rock razor steel 
Tap your program, show the world I'm the man 
You copy Poppa Large, the industry is large 

[Chorus]

[Chorus

As I do see sorta rugged wack beer commercials 
Some rappers are bought and puppeteered like the Ninja Turtles 
From Manhattan I heat up, yo light up Times Square
I make noise like open high hats on your cheap snare 
No promotional shows, girls wear corn rows 
People with hooded sweaters on crack keep me on my toes 
I walk with straw hats, fake glasses in the projects 
Bring my ghost image so tense on the line of scrimmage 
Playing my numbers, waiting for the Five to come 
Spaghetti out the window, people acting dumb 
Fire hazards wake the neighbors, your family's nosy 
I come and go as I please on blockhead MC's 
You bought new sneakers, no car, scrambling on the corner 
I'm not the star you are, the city's fallen far 
By mechanism, you're on my tip 
Stay off my penis, you've duplicated me for years 

Yeah, yeah, yeah, you are the one

Kool Keith,"Yo money 
Yeah whassup cool Keith? 
Yo that girl Kadiva gon' come to your house 
With, blonde hair and boots 
Tell her rent a cheap room on Sunset Boulevard 
For $16.95 I ain't tryin to get no Madrian no Marriott 
Or all that higher stuff 
Yo we can go on cheaper man 
I know somethin for like $10.99 man 
It's a hotel with roaches in it and everything 
It's almost near skid row  

Buttnaked! Girls walk Sunset with they ass out 
I start Cadillacs with suits, wear my mask out 
With brims tilted, I finger pop the whole block 
Make freaks wear wigs, and put the rubbres on my cock 
You see me out there, with big balls like Rosie Grier 
Players cream, I pull panties out your wet dreams 
Get deep in cracks, and wash em out like Mr. Clean 
Bring your Massengil, the public think I'm very ill 
Like Jimmy Z, posin naked for the FCC 
I'm not no basketball star, your girl watch me pee 
Clock me like cops, every time my sperm drops 
She's in my face with thongs, chewin lollipops 
I'll hit that butt on the low, just like Monica 
Play three tunes and let her blow on my harmonica 
I'm out here, you rollin fake in Union Square 
I'll make you go blonde, brunettes runnin down they hair 

[Chorus: x2] 

Regular girl, is so boring (get out my face) 
Regular girl, you never turn me on (work the latex) 

You saw my porno flick, nutsacs banged up on your TV 
Your girl pulled her panties off real quick, tryin to see me 
She wants an autograph, a part with my anal staff 
You scream test for AIDS, stretch marks make me laugh 
Sign your contracts for Willie, smoke a big Phillie 
I'm too old for young girls, gigglin' actin' silly 
I'm Sugar Daddy, your aunt gon' be worried duke 
Your moms at my hotel, her bra is real cute 
Dressed in G-strings, she's scopin' me, eatin' fruit 
She licked my balls, I came like Niagara Falls 
Brought her tittes to Prince show instead of Lou Rawls 
Her pelvis grind, she smile show me pantylines 
I'll smack that butt, the pro spank at different times 
Like Max? hardcore ? it's on the dirty floor 
Make you scream for stiff rods, you don't want no more 
Penetration, I don't do that on your menustration 
I want movies back, you smile, addin' lubrication 
You know your steelo, orgies doin' three people 
Kodak action, Black Tail, butt satisfaction 
You lookin' good sweet cheeks

[Chorus] 

I turned the Lakers off, you can't stop my afterparty 
A fifth of vodka, and latex, drink your Bacardi 
I serve it well through tubes and watch your rectum swell 
Service your clits with steel, machines keep it real 
Got that ramrod, that's pumpin through your back hard 
You be seein' cum stains on Sunset Boulevard 
My rubber send streaks and heels off your girl's feets 
You not psychadelic wimp, I'm still your girl's pimp 
That's part interest, magnificent, mind power 
I got nuts that clean kill, let me take my shower 
Wash off my pubic, and let the females do my nails 
Watch naked legs in chairs and enter soft tails 
Wear stockin' caps with maps and shoft for soft cracks 
Lift off your hairpeace, while milk squirts up on your weave 
You know my skin needs butter, your cheeks are popcorn 
I get deep, go run in butt like the unicorn 
Rodeo anus banger, quick with the middle finger 
Her tampons drop down between her Maxi 
I left tips for cocked up legs in the taxi 
Yo take her home cab driver, here's her panties

Let my dog lick you German Shepard want to bust off 

I tell your legs and swat em, MC's having anal sex 

Step around like a Tampax, and step up next 

I enter New York, no problem with my dick out

I pioneered this shit, you keep sucking dick 

Your girl's in the crowd, hawking me for a naked flick 

I got my silk underwear for the atmosphere 

Piss in your face and urinate all in your hair 

You name a group that's shit, I will pooper-scoop 

Fuck with this, miss, I will damage on the premesis 

Niggas step back with Dax grease, watch their ass twist 

I rhyme any nigga, golden showers up in Greek Alley 

Movie star bitches, MC's lining up in Cali 

Drinking vodka, Absolut, sipping Tanqueray 

Mc's jump off, I stung your rectum like a stingray

Kool Keith,"I went back to Ohio 
But my city was gone 
There was no train station 
There was no downtown 
South Howard had disappeared 
All my favorite places 
My city had been pulled down 
Reduced to parking spaces 
A, o, way to go Ohio

Well I went back to Ohio 
But my family was gone 
I stood on the back porch 
There was nobody home 
I was stunned and amazed 
My childhood memories 
Slowly swirled past 
Like the wind through the trees 
A, o, oh way to go Ohio

I went back to Ohio 
But my pretty countryside 
Had been paved down the middle 
By a government that had no pride 
The farms of Ohio 
Had been replaced by shopping malls 
And Muzak filled the air 
From Seneca to Cuyahoga falls 
Said, a, o, oh way to go Ohio",My City Was Gone,1998

For major alteration, my final approach is to spray y'all 
Attack ya like roaches 
Don't step to me at the food court at the municipal airport 
Your unmatched performance can't stop my endurance 
Runaway 18-L, pilot one, change in your slot 
Number two you're through, dischargin' your battery 
Stop rappin' to me

Geared toward the universe while black people think the worse 
Realistically expect my gross is twenty times your checks 
Triple that diamond around your necks, besides I hate cars 
You feel the turbulence, fasten seatbelts, close your vents 
Rugged horsepower, M-20-F, executive manifestin' you a lesson 
False representation'll leave y'all sweatin' in the train station 
Remember I'm blacker than your used Acura 
That's why I laugh at ya

I am the original black Elvis

Wearin' my short leather jacket 
Marilyn Monroe on my back 
I'm livin' that life 
I'm for real with this 
That's what I think about 
I like to tell my fans 

I got my shades, big rock star compared to Elvis 
Signin' autographs for rappers while girls move they pelvis 
Write songs quickly for Elton John or Lionel Richie 
Call up my butler, get clothes washed by the maid 
Ivory soap; this is clean; feel like Cascade 
I count the bills, roll to Detroit in Sedan De villes
I throw my skully on, big robe like Marvin Gaye 
Step in the front row, prime time; I move your way 
Budweiser Fest sound check, demanding more respect 
I come correct through the Metro and turn y'all petrol 
I'm up here early, bitin' donuts, sippin' on espresso 
While you sleep, I creep, gainin' ground by the week 
Ampex reels, makin' phone calls; I'm closin' deals 
I move with skill, ride through Philly streets in Cherry Hill 
I'm doin' it well, I'm doin' it swell

I talk swift; the rock king, black Romeo 
I pack clubs; promoters put me out in Tokyo 
Damage your area; I'm a launch a fierce missile 
I roll schools, movin' butt like I'm toilet tissue 
What is your issue? You over, man; I don't miss you 
Scottie soft, you play like Jan Van Breda Kolff 
New Jersey Nets real man; you ain't no Donald Hillman 
Bald head like Slick Watts, I run rap like Mayor Koch 
Forward your info while Tony Lou crank the Benzo 
Move out your driveway; white girls look, turn they eye away 
Jealous in fact, tryin' to rip the capes off my back 
I move with calm and potential through instrumentals 
Y'all front on BET with slum gold, drivin' rentals 
I get real dino, runnin' groups like a rhino 
Endin' careers - that's my job; yo, your rap is final 
Cancel your in-stores; your new job is moppin' floors 
Fixin' tiles, stoppin' potholes up on the roof

Have your manager scared, the radio station say I'm sorry 
Pack your bags; I move my luggage to the coliseum 
Infinite prime piece with statues in the rock museum 
Changin' my zones, drinkin' cocktails on cellular phones 
I tour with Anthrax through Texas with the Rolling Stones 
Booked by the agency, famous artists payin' me 
Hotels with fly room, with sneakers starin' at the moon 
Mad atmosphere, ridin' first class on British Air 
Lobster and steak while y'all back in time doin' remakes 
I'm futuristic, nine-nine to the year four thousand
I make announcements, drop skills, then I bounce with 
Fly young ladies, AMG kicks, 2000 Mercedes 
Brand new models, only seen one in Colorado 
Light green metallic in the Shark Bar eatin' salad

Here's my number call me direct, get no feedback 
No interviews, channel four, see me on the news 
Erase your message walk streets with my cellular phone 
Address you wonder, don't try to catch me home alone 
Up seven o'clock, while you trying to find me on my block 
I'm at the airport, you think I'm strange, boardin' the plane 
Turn off my pager, then quickly, relax my feet 
Hotel Onion drinkin' brew watchin' Sesame Street 
You thought you saw me with a wig on, at 7/11 
Disguised like Shakespeare with blue chrome behind your ear 
My George Washington robe, I still travel the globe 
On Pan-Am air flights, I roll in cities after midnight 
Stand in your lobby unsuspected, you get neglected 
Traffic was hectic

Order room service, transfer quick to Holiday Inn 
Check out time nine o'clock, coat on, I'm on again 
You comin' so wack you sound like the Bulworth soundtrack 
I'm in the mall steady shoppin' while you tryin' to call 
It's on my answering machine, to speak to me as a dream 
Pacific Bell know him, the phone is off, and I'm well known 
1-800 number, castle code see to summer 
Extreme complicated businessman, can't be reached 
No type of headquarters, deserted land, by the waters 
Target my focus on, internal thinkin' by myself 
You catch the treatments hiatus like Sam on the shelf 
Move out your zip code with you-Haul, watch you fall 
Obtain five boxes callin' Mayflower, every hour 
You scratch your brain askin' neighbors what, now you wonder 

While you search lookin' deep in your Rolodex, I flex, I tell the truth 
When I'm serious you think I'm mysterious, drop rap in minutes 
Become your problem like Dennis the Menace 
Hold up your meetings papi, let's ? to the paparazzi 
Unseen heard of your magazine got the nerve of a two-year old crayon writing 
Talkin' to y'all I'm decidin' 
Communication leads one step to aggravation

I was always wondering about you
Your whole group evolving different images around me

Acting like they don't copy me when they see me
You've spent your whole life listening to ""Critical Beatdown""
You's a secret fan; every time I create an A.K.A. character
Most of you groups out there are so wack, looking at my shoes in my videos

The back of my album cover, and stealing my marketing plan
Like you inventing something new to the company 
and in reality you're clones of me
(Y'all can't wait for my album to come out to steal something new)

You should bow to the master! 
(Worship me, worship me, worship me, worship me) [Repeat: x4]

I pity the untalented, half of why'all creativity is to steal duplicate
The clothes I wear, call your promotional staff to get you out
Quick in the magazines to perpetrate me on your Ampex reels
On tour most MC's draw sketches of me and watch what I'm wearing

I found out why rappers look at me jealous and keep staring
Comparing me to themselves from a distance when I walk offstage
Your record label, your group, and your fanbase giving me a standing ovation
In the Chicago Bull warmup suit and a bald head like Michael Jordan

Six-time championship of the league, four million groups in the industry
Rakim and Canibus is the only ones rapping pro speed
I average 52 rappers per game, I put you to shame
Now you gonna sit in your used Expedition and act like you don't know my name

I don't have to battle anybody nor freestyle
Half of your flows are written by rookies working Montreal Expos
I don't care if you act wild, bring your raps to the studio
I'm a get in your booty, yo

I'm a set up a bag of dust on the console
So you can do this, light up, and smoke, yo, cause I'm no joke yo
I might ride on the cycle level 3, vomit when you go in the booth
Your product manager is going to say, ""Yo who is he?""
(Yo who is that, man?)
	
You should bow to the master! 
(Worship me, worship me, worship me, worship me) (Repeat 2x)

I don't play with skinny legs and the water head
Time after time you don't know what I'm thinking when I come
Into your studio professional with a white man driving a Continental Lincoln
Groupies look at me, y'all don't pay me no mind

I'm about to tear a new ass in this kid, he'd better not let me rhyme
Yeah, take a break, order some blunts
I'm about to get up all in your fronts
With your body shaped like Mitch Green and Tony Tubbs, you don't want this

Go in the corner with your stomach hanging, gold teeth looking sneaky
I'm a let you know how be, G
No matter how much your styles change you can't see me
Believe that, light up your ass souped up

Stand behind your backup, with your acne-faced girlfriend
You're gonna get a lot of feedback
Test the best, you're gonna have water on your kneecap

You should bow to the master!

I choose my subjects, personal man, that's what I want to write
Critics critique, I compel that lots of rappers weak
'97 I blacked out, he's paying all my rent
Larger than hip-hop, you watch me like the president
No feedback on R&B scams motivate me
With stretch marks around your gut plus I know you hate me
Guard your feet, lose cellulite, I'm a come complete
Work off your stomach pounds with super sonic stomach sounds
That's word to hoss, animal heads, stupid fly gorilla
I get pros vexed, on ghetto clicks I get iller
Guard your rab mics, my style shine like zebra stripes
Right in your forehead, my word becomes a real missile
I be hanging in back doors like Rose's toilet tissue
Hydrolic engines blow flies out your left window
Your rap is catnip with slob dropping on the pillow
Shut your face, shut your mouth like pigeons floying south
I'm rolling rampart, the bottom kids where you start
Get off my two sacks, light your pipes, load your cracks

Department of agriculture scheming like a vulture
I burn your sideburns off on tracks like John Shaft
You be counting your pubic hairs trying to do the math
Like mascot, you front your ashy face and black beat
Studio plastic melts panties sweating street heat
I'll be there like Vladimir packing in your ear
Dr. Smith, Will Robinson make you say ""Oh dear""
I take your tour bus, treat you like infested puss
Lima beans drop down and grease your dirty jeans
National thunderstorms, step up and find your power
Your records hot melt like yogurt and you smell sour
Get my reels, Ampex, a-DAT system flex
You got polio knees, lock fell on Soul Train
The answer is Anorex, punks I'll flip your brain
Like Don Cornelius, I hide behind the scenes
Make you lick my hot dogs with ketchup on two beans
I censorship real quick and feed your family cabbage
Make you thought eat ham hocks, tuna out the garbage
Blind your range with tones, your radio sounds strange
Eat out your rear bag, snatch ribs out your wild coyote
Tell Bob to pay me, the company boss still owe me
But Capitol built walls, built fences
I come for my check, don't lower your defenses

Get off my elevator!

Greasing my status Wolly Smith want to change gears
One-to one-to three-four man slappin' five
People in the back fidge your face, while I rip it live

You can pick me up at the round busstation
Or I can take a plane
Give me a sek and I'll tell you how it went down

[Kool Keith]
I stayed in New York, depressed, walkin' mad through the block
Watching brothers go down, my project friends smoking rock
My group divided and everthing was undecided
I was drinking, thinking: ""Damn and my boat is sinking""
Everybody's wack can new groups comin' back
They on Arsenio, ???? on video
Watch this clownrhyme that's payed for a primetime
Everybody's mean, they're hard, they're killing mothers
Shootin' bang bang fake man killing brothers
I had to turn off the radio from all the war???
Mickey Mouse and friends all talking pop and lippy
Girls excited for what? And old ?facturated?
People got their brain washed and folks got manipulated
They start believing Donald Duck made the earth
The industry was cursed since the Dinosaur's birth

Flying nighttime, eating peanuts on the plane
With no moneycontrol, my stress builds on my brain
My ticket's oneway
I'm out to southern Caliway
I left behind some people that wasn't even equal
I thought back with chicks and freaks in 86'
When Marlie was in in control +the funky magic mix+
I had the limousine on hold with the real chauffeur
Ripped the ???? up with Ultra and I felt like Oprah
Girls in flocks and fans in lines from blocks
I didn't even hear a ?paperview? rappin' mister
I was your idol and probably on your older sister
Now you bad you signed stupid with a recorddeal
Your image is butt you perpertrating Shootin' Steel
Holdin' guns on albumcovers just to make funds
You the man quick fast payed out the ?anoass?
You can see I'm back and clear on stereo
with my own style, my intimite material

Ye, your style changed every year
Think about what you did
Used to dance, used to wear suits
Then you came back to wearing hip-hop clothes
Then you went back to wearing suits

Money, expenses for trips I didn't know
Agencies finding shows I couldn't get myself
Writing rhymes at night in the house by myself
I open mailboxes, all I see was more bills
Gettin' cold chicken, walkin' down Ryan's hills
Askin' moms for 50 cent, just to pay my rent
I had no will to ill, my mind was out to kill
I called up Kurt, got a ??? signed with Capitol
Money's flowin' now wild suckas out blowin' up
They my pupic care, and pupils still growin' up
Sucking mean while the g'ism as it hits the rhythm
They want that new style, no money it's called freestyle
Taping of the radio, smokin' from a crackvowel
They on my tip now, as always as usual
You forgot me, but I didn't forget you

Sleep in the bathtub, get rid of the waterbed

And lean back, fruit cocktail and pancakes syrup
Flow down your butt crack, ice cream around your pelvis

You wanna meet guys like me, directors in Hollywood
You wanna sell this, win awards in Vegas, slide your G-strings off
You're wit' the top film makers, mid-town traffic

Removing your panties off slow on Penn Station escalators

Hands around the missal, you made it to the majors

Adjust the antennas, hunny, no need for cable
I fix the triple X wires, don't lie if you're on your time of the month

You don't have to rush, 'cause internal problems can hold
I don't want the room to smell like car tires
I'm sipping stolichnayas, butterscotch
Soaking your G-spot area from Breyer's
Don't fool yourself with the toys under your bed

The date - summer, August 25th
You was transferred from Riker's Island to Attica State Prison
Gina, Thompson
I told you you shouldn'ta went out there with those other girls

And stole a coach bag out of Macy's
Arguin with me every night, you was crazy
Callin your grandmother sayin I beat you, you think I'm mental & crazy
That Benz you pulled up you stole you didn't faze me

You had a nice body with bikers
Inmates and female C.O.'s was lookin at your body at Riker's
I took time to write you a letter
But you wanted me to put dope in your sweater

I thought you was sick, with the flu, did you get any better?
Did you write back your Auntie Trineta? Floss and don't pay
Jack say he seen you with a drug dealer that day
You would of been better off takin the subway

[Chorus]
My girl's in jail for life, never comin home - never comin home
She got to pay the price

[Kool Keith]
You got too big in New York
You needed big hustlers around everywhere you walk
A lot of Cristal, fake ballers poppin corks
Now you in a two-inch cell, eatin eggs and pork

Friday the 13th, your birthday, the worst day
I still had love for your dumb ass anyway
Bentley's and Rolls Royces
The answering machine filled up with mysterious voices

Your moms Ms. Jones called, I was in the mall, she said,
""Keith - Tina and Terry got them fake credit cards.
They got my daughter out there - I ain't seen Gina in two weeks.""
I hung up the phone

I knew you was workin with some bronze pimp in the streets
(pimp in the streets.. pimp in the streets)

[Chorus]

[Kool Keith]
I called the operator to block the calls and stop the calls
The ceiling in my apartment was leakin like Niagara Falls
Sendin you a bunch of money, clothes and munchin money
You got a lot of phone call threats from a girl named Sunny

I seen the chick from the back
Puerto Rican girl with a nice ass drivin a black Cadillac
With a guy with long sideburns, is that your mack?
(is that your mack.. is that your mack)

Very different - and he wants to talk to you
Admire his immaturity

Took you away to better places
Brazil, Costa Rica you seen new faces
Covered the bills you struggled to pay - gave you life
No more kid with a scarf around his beatin you up every day
Plastic surgery breast implants the small hustler made you cry
Because he was confused, you lay while he play
Cleanin my house, you look gorgeous in lingerie
Is that the kid on the phone? Hardcore
Hawkin you in front of the building everyday
When is he gonna learn? It's over, it's my turn
You're pregnant with my kid
By the fireplace, we watch his doo-rags burn
I remodeled you, gave you the diamonds he couldn't wisely concern
Always talkin bout the cash he got
The little pesos for shows
And God knows his materialistic raps and wack flows
are like Stay Free pads, fake V.I.P. rappers get garbage disposed
Unrecouped for his flamboyance and reflection
He's leasin rentin and frontin - yeah, yeah..

On a first class flight in the Bahamas, grab your bags quickly

You're over like Al Green
This song is written for the 2003 team
V.I.P. with Ben Vareen
Cancel your A&R meeting light you up like Heatwave - central heating
Eject your premature CD in the whirlpool while we're eating
Shut down all material, new tracks fall on your head like a crane
All you offered to women is sound of weak drums
Fill they hearts with pain
I'm in your dungaree jacket like a bleach stain
Girls cry on my arm, he was cheap and silly don't complain
He's a nerd with a hardcore twist, playin with racing cars

Shattered your career

Witcha boring producers
Your videos are boring, same girls singin
Everybody tryin to be George Clinto and Jimi Hendrix wannabes

I'm beyong that average cha cha, that trendy Southside music
People don't hate, just motivate
You spent twenty years rappin about diamonds and Dom P
Moet and bubbly, while you front your wife and girlfriend hug me

Studio gangsters lamp at Fort Lee
With transexuals tryin to hide in secret spots in New Jersey
Cats pose in leased double-are's with two-way pagers
Frontin like you like women I seen you on your Motorola

Typin the best places to meet up with Richard Simmons and Jack Lemmon
When you in Cali you hide in the Valley
Rentin the Sheraton suites
Callin young boys that look like Johnny Versace

To meet you at Miami Beach
You wear black all the time, you look wack all the time
Got the nerve to try to pose with a girl, then spit a hard rhyme
Like you run the streets with thugs

And move with brothers who do mad crime
I'm a tell you how I feel
I'm a tell you how I feel
I'm a tell you how I feel

I'm a tell you how I feel
Take you out simple add a dim effect to your spotlight
You think you hot right
Surround the tables got you kissin your bodyguards, holdin Cris'

The last time I heard a guy called you a dude
With a FUBU jacket said ""excuse you miss""
With his hair like Lil' Kim, contact lenses
Dapper Dan gear with ice on his wrist

Your hype man walk with a twist
Just like the girls, you want a man that's rich
You want a guy to say come here BIZZITCH
Yo, you like the way celebrities fondle you and touch

You want to look onstage and stare at the crotch
I know a type of guy like you that try like you
Wear lipstick and cry like you
I'm a tell you how I feel

I'm a tell you how I feel
I'm a tell you how I feel
I'm a tell you how I feel
Trendy guy like you with your man watchin Hendrix

Look at the way your corny album was mixed
That feminine stuff why'all put out was marketing tricks
Clones with costumes step out of my dressin room
Duplicators break down the reel

Your DJ funny style that makes it a trio
I don't care if you got a budget and per diem
I saw you jockin Marilyn Manson in the Niko
Your sound is outdated you network with a lot of people

What the fuck why'all tellin me?

Don't act like you don't remember me
You used to bump my shit in Mars
Now you on some trim goatee shit like El DeBarge
Fuck the Tunnel tonight and that petty shit at the Garage

Is Stretch bumpin my shit?
Do I have to pay niggaz with envelopes and a bottle of Cris'?
Fuck a Rolex, I got the same shit you got on my wrist

All that jealousy shit is mayonnaise and celery shit
why'all hated down South and West coast rappers one time
Now everybody that was frontin is now slurpin they dick
Inhalin like Menthols and Vicks

Most of why'all can't stand to see a nigga shine with jewelry and kicks

Now I used to know, Bambaataa used to play everybody's shit
I ain't think even cool Herc came out with some ol' bullshit like that
When all the DJ's, back in the days, them niggaz stuck to-fuckin-gether

You see, Theodore, didn't mind, Mean Gene, on his set
Now these new motherfuckers, are like, on some new futuristic shit

And turkey sandwich on top of the 'fridgerator

Put your Chanel shades on, walk with your thong in your butt 
Runnin your fingers through your cheap raise(?) 
Look at your girlfriend with her hair weave fallin out 
On my phone, runnin up my bill 
Talkin to broke-ass drug dealer friends 
To Western Union you three dollars from Cancun 
You're now in the red with your real hair stickin from under your wig 
Showin behind your head, with real, pimples on your face

With a seventy-five Rolls Royce, that look like Alfred Hitchcock

Even if you have braids like Latrell

Tall lean men who can't read books to they kids need tutors

by e-mailing, golddiggers on computers

Bounce that ass, bounce that ass, let your knees touch your elbows
In Detroit, Michigan cruisin spaceships of Daddyville
Just got back from Bootyville, spending big face bills

On some exotic body hottie erotic
Vision blurry from the narcotics, keep pushin CRAZY products
Parlay, parlay, twenty-fo' seven all day

Why'all get high tonight, ladies in love
On my jock, and cry tonight, suckas say 'Why tonight'

I do indeed in greed explore meet the patients 
Back to brooms with the nurse with the voodoo curse 
Holding up office lights standing at huge heights 
Back and forth left wing swing to North 
East and South with blood pouring down your mouth 
I come prepared with the white suit and stethoscope 
Listen to your heartbeat, delete beep beep BEEP 
Your insurance is high, but my price is cheap 
Look at the land... Blue Flowers! 
Drawing by the purple pond, in the purple pastures Blue Flowers! 
Drawing by the purple pond, yellow ink that flows Blue Flowers! 
Drawing by the pond, look, it's raining yellow 
Would you care to listen to me more? Thank you 
Holding bags on down right from the hospital 
It's a patient that's worth to keep the germs off the turf 
Cybernetic microscopes and metal antidote 
Two telescopes that magnify the size of a roach 
Three computers to cup of coffee planted with my hand and 
Astroplanets detached turn on rear foggers 
Cut the light on the kid, and turn the bright on 
Supersonic waves combine and burn as brainwaves 
I see the mascot of Evil he's not Knievel 
Shakespeare's gone don't even think about it 
Yes, as I'm going to the park, I see... Blue Flowers! 
It's raining green, by the pond Blue Flowers! 
It's totally raining green, pouring Blue Flowers! 
I smell the bees and the birds Blue Flowers! 
Different aspects of life, blue flowers

Yo, fuck octagon!
Don't ask me about that fuckin' shit
Fuckin' ask me about that fuckin' shit again!
I ain't doin' that type of shit (I ain't doin' that shit)
You motherfuckers think I'm crazy right? (yeah you crazy)
I know, but I am..

I have to show niggas, word g, I have to blow niggas
Tech 9's, carbines, pointin' in your fuckin' faces
Thirty-eight magnum butcher knife man, watch me stab em
Q his kid left there, with ambulances, by the wheelchair

Dangerous action, I'm the movie, I'm the main attraction
Fuck up your front lawn with m&m's, jiffy popcorn
Piss in your mailbox, throw shitty pampers every two blocks
Cut up your great dane, with charcoal out, leavin' great flame

You fuckin' bastard, don't fuck with me, you gettin' blasted
Niggas get fucked up, you black niggas are actin' white
Your Rolex gone, my project's on your airplane flights
First time you check out, baggage claim will throw your neck out

Cut off your bodyguards, fast start with razor scars
Come grab the sub machines, Joe step to seminars
Niggas with diamonds, armed crack heads, clock y'all rhymin
Take your girl's necklace, stare at the cops, lookin' reckless

Ass on the corner, think you safe workin' at warner brothers?
Polygram building heard some shots, they want me to chill then
Security ran, Russell Simmons saw me in a black van
I ran the tight intersection, and caught a big erection

Spinnin' on 3rd, lexington, through the fuckin' red
I'm in manhattan, naked wigs, on my fuckin' head
Streets full of traffic, drive on sidewalks, that's my habits

[Chorus]
Mental case, mental case
(Man, he be likin' campbell's soup, apple jacks
double XL diapers)
Mental case, mental case
(Chocolate milk, porno films
Flintstone tablets}

(Roscoe waffles... and make them extra soft dude!)

[Dr. dooom]
Your style is bitch kid, you fucked up, sound like a woman
I'm not impressed when you sport mics and touch your breast
You trans vest with small flows, you can't, proper digest
You open mic stands, you catch one, with sperm in your hand

I leave you thinkin' in your hotels, with pussy stinkin'
Massengil thrills flow through new york, to Hollywood hills
Your male flow, I'm wipin' ass cracks like mop-n-glo
Mc's get inserts, thrash style selectin' bad words

Move with your silk suits, I stomp your mics with combat boots
Make up your rap that's feeble, small you think it's major
I pull your rectum out, erase your girl, off my pager
International feedback, I make you twist your knee back

I got your crew on camcorders, tryin' to rhyme in teaback's
Garter belts on dj's, sportin' tryin' to spin on felts
I see that rugged kid comin' through, gimme that screwface
He's wearin' girdles, your back-up man, sportin' pink lace

... hey man you better watch your back up in here man
They rapin little boys!

[Chorus]

[Dr. dooom]
I stop your intro, move your mic at your birthday party
Your group set up, takin' turns, y'all shut the fuck up
Walk, grab your nuts, leave the kangol's and scratch your butts
Stage shows get messed up, you're hardcore, zippin your dress up

Move on your projects, new shit, that's how I do shit
Word up g, y'all niggas sound puss, lick my pee-pee veteran nasty
Don't even try to fuckin' ask me, fax you my phone number
I beat you down with steel cans and wood lumber

Open your face up, dress you with makeup
Have your bitch-made, makin' cool-aid with your ass out
In a glass house, where convicts wear big dicks
Strong niggas, got your assholes in the mix
You need protection for that tight infection

Kool Keith,"Yeah..
You motherfuckers oughta let me go and finish this motherfuckin album
Dr. Dooom..
Name of this track is called ""I Don't Want the Motherfuckin Chorus""
Whatever all the arrangements are we gon' go through
Fuck all the laws..

What the fuck was in your mind when you rapped on that track?
Who possessed you to do that? Who programmed - that shit sound wack
Unplug your mic
You motherfuckers rap under a bunch of fuckin hype
Programmed by the company, makin somethin cheap
Vocals sound like a nigga with no dough and a promo;
makin asses out of yourselves, tryin to rap solo
Suck my dick when you see me; avoid because you want to be me
why'all niggaz write like slouches puffin blunts on studio couches
What's up you fuckin amateur?
Your engineer'll cue in your bullshit cadence
That shit sounds simple; look at this nigga rhymin to hisself
Wack as fuck, smell like shit for one buck
Big crews don't want it -- why'all get it worse
Which one of why'all motherfuckers is waitin for the mic first?
I hope your bitch is in the audience
Your wife too, that's your fanbase -- plus your DJ's in the place
I'm about to boo you, let it be fair; when you come off-stage
ninety percent of the people that came on your guest list
ain't gon' be there
A big dissapointment when I rub your asshole with a verbal ointment
Rappers actin hard, nervous in the dressin room
with a security guard
Groupies standin round with they fuckin face frowned
Lookin like fuckin Homey the Clown
Put that Spring Water down man, you ain't sweatin
You motherfuckers did a ten minute weak show and you jettin;
your fans are mad - your performance was garbage bag
Look at these videotapes
Walkin back and forth grabbin your nuts like the Planet of the Apes
Supervise it, criticize it, why'all don't realize it
where the real guys at
Who's administrating your budget when you takin 
that high picture for Right On with your ballroom light on
You know the night is kind of special like Lowenbrau
when I escort you to your car, you breakout bastards
Leave the premises and reminisce on your rookie season after you first started
You try to work hard and you never paid no dues like Cold Crush and Afrika Bambaata
You wack nigga, tryin to act large in the video in Nevada
You fuckin pink maggot; I'll take your mic, you can't have it
You niggaz be runnin around with ears open like fuckin bunny rabbits

That's right, Dr. Dooom
All you motherfuckers around the world sittin in studios with your boys
Hypin your shit up
Motherfuckers don't want to tell you that your shit is wack
because they all yes men
Sittin around, carryin your roadie cases
Bein your fuckin cheerleaders
I'ma tell you straight, look in the fuckin mirror, you wack
That shit don't sound right, your mixdown ain't right
Your vocals are too low.. your fuckin cadence is off
Stage show's weak.. fuck you!",No Chorus.,2004
Kool Keith,"""Yeah  cool Keith should keep it real 
He should rap about space and Mars""

[Kool Keith] 
Yo  I'm tired of looking at everybody. Same boots  skully hats in 
90 degree weather  looking to get into clubs for free. I'm not 
smoking blunts  or looking for jazz records at the Roosevelt. 

I left New York  the city itself was stress depression 
High boots and urban beats  that wasn't my direction 
Producers filtering join in with R&B 
A million rappers, some clones trying to sound like me 
Biting my space styles, biting my horror-core 
All I saw was cool Keiths on my thaw 
Record companies had G'd-off all my royalties 
Watching vinyl spin, local groups' wack MC's 
Some try to rap with that perpetrate mobster crap 
Karl Kani jeans, fat stomachs in the limousines 
Mixtapes by wack DJ's adds doo doo play 
I'm on the turnpike, the city drifting down the highway 
Like a mirage, the style there is all illusion 
On videos out of town, peoples buy confusion 
Rolling high with cash pulled over down my eye 
Since I've been out, y'all can't see 

[Chorus]
Is the world made of plastic? 
Is the city buried in dreams? (Yeah) 
Is the world made of plastic? 
Cause that's the way is seems

Watching TV so bored, while imbiciles hold the mic cord 
Graffiti playgrounds are played out, yo how'd that sound? 
Army fatigues are weak, is for the minor leagues 
No rapping cyphers or brothers in the rented Benz 
Crews on stage, acting hard with a thousand friends 
I saw the place turn plastic, crackers looping beats 
People with no deals, walkmen rappin on the streets 
I turned my back, 90% of the city sounded wack 
Payola scams switched DJ's like a rubber band 
Everybody clear with beats trying to be Premier 
Clearing samples, your SP-12 fake examples 
My money grows with green from my own label 
While you act rich with no cash on the bigger label 
Your tri-state ways are shut down by barricades 
In fact I packed my bags, and listened to E-40 
Mac Mall, see-Bo, and other rappers you don't know 
You're narrow-minded and styles of mind you won't find it 
My sound proceeds with moog and undertone bass 
No comic gimmicks with beats rapping in my face 
I come back real, solid rock razor steel 
Tap your program, show the world I'm the man 
You copy Poppa Large, the industry is large 

[Chorus: x2]

As I do see sorta rugged wack beer commercials 
Some rappers are bought and puppeteered like the Ninja Turtles 
From Manhattan I heat up, yo light up Times Square 
I make noise like open high hats on your cheap snare 
No promotional shows, girls wear corn rows 
People with hooded sweaters on crack keep me on my toes 
I walk with straw hats, fake glasses in the projects 
Bring my ghost image so tense on the line of scrimmage 
Playing my numbers, waiting for the Five to come 
Spaghetti out the window, people acting dumb 
Fire hazards wake the neighbors, your family's nosy 
I come and go as I please on blockhead MC's 
You bought new sneakers, no car, scrambling on the corner 
I'm not the star you are, the city's fallen far 
By mechanism, you're on my tip 
Stay off my penis, you've duplicated me for years 
Yeah, yeah, yeah, you are the one

I used to check out, use the mad route 
Stare at these ugly bitches, sit at the table with frowns with their
Stomachs out
Cellulite for weeks, rules in these NewYork streets
With mad Babies, big heads movin' in the stroller
You gettin' older while that dress hangs off your shoulder
You stupid bitch
He's sick, the kids got the shits
You walkin' wack with those problems in your ass crack
You chose this nigga, he's a zero girl, doin' nothin'
You was buggin' because the bum had curly hair
You got psyched, the baby came out with some nappy hair
You was a fine freak, thoroughbred dumb with no head
I seen you screamin' with your panties up in B.B.Q's
Your friends are fat with guts, breakin' all the rules
You choose to lose, no cheers, recievin' booes
Rent is due with some old crab nigga fuckin' you
It's true, it's summertime, what you gonna do?
Every winter you got this gay man screwin' you
This bitch is a problem, no money, fuckin' dummy
She's from the slum actin' fly eatin' bread crums
Shoplifted programs out on the boulevard
Stretch marks leak out your tight dress, your legs are scarred

Rappers rappin' for cheese
It's like a disease the way niggas be snatchin' your fees
Executives, even accountants playin' artists like chips
The last time you were legit I was suckin' on nips
Up in my shit like a Dog checkin' the sex
Maybe to get in the Lex
Hey, they forget, all the doors slammin' 
They crammin', eye jammin' 
Wait, ""My shows slammin'""
Cash up your nose Hammond
Landin' deals ain't shit if your label ain't shit
Nitwits spit for sips while I flip scripts legit 
Commit to whippin' ass on the mic, it's like a fuckin' runway
These niggas is like bitches fleein' from gunplay
One day when lyrical finesse is stressed instead of dress I'll compress
Compression and hate, blow out the best
But it's cool, fools like you makin' crews that's blue stay true
One-Thousand lyrical orators, pay dues
So snooze and get dissed
Bust in the head with Cris', fake ice on your wrist
I'm nice and you on my dick like piss
You wish you was half the lyricist that I persist to be

Kool Keith,"Yeah! This is a national message! N.A.S.A. worldwide! One, take the spotlight off me. (take the spotlight of me)

I remember when the Cubans was first on Broadway.
With dark and yellow gold,
I was 11 years old.
The inspiration was spread out like a blanket, ask em'.
My discovery was beyond the pick, the Lee suit, and the afro.
Now from the flair jeans on 169th and College.
Watching the dude lean on one-seven-o
With a Kangol 'cross America,
I saw the hippies cross.
By Herc on Technique needles syncopated time was on time,
The same time as the Beatles.
I was up there watching James Brown's pockets, stuffed withJolly
Ranchers.
when the NFL had the Rams in Los Angeles,
Charles Finley in Oakland,
And my kindergarten moment was the beginning.
'Til the Caribbean people came to New York and sheepskin
was bought,
The wind breaker

The building never fall down.
They are the teeth of the town (spacious thoughts)
they crush us up in they grind,
The meat and bone of the mind.
We gather here on the block (spacious thoughts)
They key broke off in the lock.
I'll meet you down by the well
I'll meet you down by the well (spacious thoughts)

The balloon drops down at midnight
Stranglin' the monkey with the hands of a clock
Good can't help but do a little evil
Evil can't help but,
do a little Good.
Who's that singing in the kitchen by the stove?
All aboard for the night train!
They say the moon, it smells just like a cherry bomb.
Come on home,
All is forgiven.
Everything costs.
Deliver us from evil,
And carry your own cross.

[Chorus]
The building never fall down.
They are the teeth of the town (spacious thoughts)
they crush us up in they grind,
The meat and bone of the mind.
We gather here on the block (spacious thoughts)
They key broke off in the lock.
I'll meet you down by the well
I'll meet you down by the well (spacious thoughts)

The time gathered with poppy seeds and grass,
Growing nobody faster than Jesse Owens.
With everything I'm seeing and knowing.
London Heathrow,
Walking through the airport with green Pro-Keds
Sixty-niners from the designers,
Tom McCann above the hill,
Next to my man, Lou Man,
The cardigan sweaters,
The still sell the New Eras now at Jew Man!
Bridge cont.(Tom Waits)
Ghetto Bhudda in the second set,
Breaking out in a cold sweat.
I'll meet you in the music.
We meet in the music,
those we never met.
Keep dancing like there's nobody watching
Everyone can win the toss.
I may wander, bit I am never lost.

Kool Keith,"I'm a feminine Eminem, a slim shady lady
But nice cause I texted Haiti
90 lady cops on the road and I'm arrested for doing 80.
Like Hamlet, all about ""words, words, words""
Divide a whole into thirds, thirds, thirds.
I'm a gay sea otter.
I blow other dudes out of the water.
I'm the man muffin, divin', muffin,
Cold and fly like an arctic puffin,
Puffin whacky tobaccy
Hatin' other rappers like I'm Helga Pataki
And I've been rockin' this mic before electricity
Way back in 1000 BCE - that's before the common era.
I can't be stopped, flow so sick that it should be mopped up
Chick's got a dixie cup, I gotta dick full of helium, I'll fuck you up.
A boy, a girl, a middle aged bitch, botox in the third person.
I give the perspective a switch and Bo talks in the third person.
Just relax, if you wanna know me, here's two facts

I hate catchy choruses and I'm a hypocrite.
Hungry, hungry hypocrite.
I hate catchy choruses and I'm a hypocrite.

Met a girl named Macy had sex with her all day,
But she was dyslexic, so I ended up doin the YMCA
We ballin', Asian, Wii bowlin', prostate cancer semi-colon,
Find that hole like I'm Stephen Hawking,
Atticus Finch, killing, mocking.
Cry like a child would, you raped my childhood
Just stroll in, roll in your pole into Rolie Polie Olie's colon.
To relax my mind I take a walk by the clock and I pass the time and
Rhymin', mathematic timin', syntax impacts the intact hymen.
I'm an internet provider, came from the web like a horny spider,
Fucked a girl in an apple orchard, then came in cider 
I thought AIDS was a butt virus like conjunction junction conjunctivitis
I spit gold bars cause I was molested by my uncle Midas
Gay dads blow pops, another sucker,
Oedipus was the first motherfucker.

We the people of the USA
Jose, we're not talkin to you, esse.
We got a border in order to keep you out,
It's what my NYU essay's about
Cause we're, xenophobic warrior princess,
Molested by my uncle Sam, is that incest?
""I want you"" to smell my finger
Does my nephew's scent still linger?
South of queers, north of hell,
The queer ones suck and the brown one's smell
We guard the border and we guard it well
But some slip through the cracks of the liberty bell
Did I say liberty? I meant taco, Paco, hey you better let that rock go
Cause in real life Goliath wins
And then sells all the silk that the widow spins.

Bitches and hoes don't exist because the hoes know Bo's a feminist,

Kool Kojak,"From the drop of blood, to bones and body parts
To vital organs, forming your brain and tiny heart
The fetus, date of birth; until puberty finally starts
Adolescence, adult, then your elderly body rots
It was divine decree that begun the plan
But is diseased by the greed of the sons of man
Don't try to leave with the guns in hand
Understand: God's the one in command

Did we climb out of the sea?
Where did we come from, you and me?
Two legs to walk, and as you see
I'm not a man I want to be
People growing, my backyard (I'm growing in your backyard)
In my garden, in my heart (I'm in your garden, I'm in your heart)
Pink and purple, red and blue (See all the colors?)
On this sunny afternoon (It's a sunny afternoon)

Back before time was time and space was space
The ever-present eye divine so laced with grace
Decided it was time to try to chase, to chase
But what it would design, now life is taking place
Within itself, divided; now it takes some space
And it can't be found alive, the mind creates the state
Of ego, now what's mine is mine
OK, now hate will reign until the blind have eyes and lay awake in wait

How are the seeds in the ground?
How is my garden growing now?
A tender kiss, a little smile
The way a mother holds its child
Tasty little human beings (Tasty little human beings)
I grow them on the people tree (I grow them on the people tree)
I will eat them one by one (Eat them one by one)
If there's enough for everyone (Like you and you)

Born in the ever-flowing life beyond the dirt
Tell me what the purpose is for creating the earth
(Maybe we created the planet as man's habitat
Be fruitful and multiply across the planet's back)
Well, why does hate exist?
The war and AIDS and shit?
If we're to be fruitful, why can't poor people pay they rent?
('Cause love and hate, both sides are conjoined
Physical forms have to deal with both sides of the coin)
Why do we die? (So you can live!)
Why do we strive? (So you can win!
But why did you defy every truthful word I recommend?)
My question back, why do you recommend an ode temptationing
(So I can test your patience and tolerance in the face of sin)
But why attest when you hold all the answers to the state we in?
(For you to bear witness of imperfections of mortal men)
So it's a lesson? (And a blessing
Journey back to where you been
'Cause before the tree can flourish seeds must first be planted in)

People growing, my backyard (I'm growing in my backyard)
In my garden, in my heart (I'm in your garden, I'm in your heart)
If you like my garden, you might like me (Look at all the colors!)

Salesman's like what up, what's your budget?
And I'm like honestly, I don't know nothing about Mopeds
He said I got the one for you, follow me
Ooh, it's too real
Chromed out mirror, I don't need a windshield
Banana seat, a canopy on two wheels
Eight hundred cash, that's a hell of a deal

I'm headed downtown, cruising through the alley
Tip-toeing in the street like Dally
Pulled up, moped to the valley
Whitewalls on the wheels like mayonnaise
Dope, my crew is ill, and all we need is two good wheels
Got gas in the tank, cash in the bank
And a bad little mama with her ass in my face
I'mma lick that, stick that, break her off, Kit-Kat
Snuck her in backstage, you don't need a wristband
Dope

Killing the game, 'bout to catch a body
Passed the Harley, Dukie on the Ducati
Timbaland, Khaled, Scott Storch, Birdman
God damn, man, everybody got Bugattis
But I'ma keep it hella nineteen eighty seven
Head into the dealership and drop a stack and cop a Kawasaki
I'm stunting on everybody, hella raw, pass the Wasabi
I'm so low that my scrotum's almost dragging up on the concrete
My seat is leather, alright, I'm lying, it's pleather
But girl, we could still ride together
You don't need a Uber, you don't need a cab
Fuck a bus pass, you got a Moped man
She got nineteen eighty eight Mariah Carey hair
Very rare, mom jeans on her derriere
Throwing up the West Side as we tear in the air
Stop by Pike Place, throwing fish to a player

Get off my mullet
Stone washed, so raw
Moped like a bullet

A po-po can't reprimand me
I'm in a B-Boy stance, I'm not dancing
I got your girl on the back going tandem
'Cause I'm too damn quick, I'm too damn slick
Whole downtown yelling out who that is?

It's me, the M, the A-C, the K
Sounding like a French pimp from back in the day
I take her to Pend Oreille and I watch her skate
I mean, water ski, ollie ollie oxen free
I'm perusing down fourth and they watching me
I do a handstand, the eagle lands on my seat
Well hello, but baby, the kickstand ain't free
Now do you or do you not wanna ride with me
I got one girl, I got two wheels
She a big girl, that ain't a big deal
I like a big girl, I like 'em sassy
Going down the backstreet listening to Blackstreet
Running around the whole town
Neighbors yelling at me like, you need to slow down
Going thirty-eight, Dan, chill the fuck out
Mow your damn lawn and sit the hell down
If I only had one helmet I would give it to you, give it to you
Cruising down Broadway, girl, what a wonderful view, wonderful view
There's layers to this shit player, tiramisu, tiramisu
Let my coat-tail drag but I ain't tearing my suit, tearing my suit

Like other music rap is an art
And if you want to get the feeling, got to feel it in your heart
You need brain power, dictation
Vocabulary, articulation
Creativity and originality
Execution of a feud formality
Versatility and a voice that's loud
With the ability to take a crowd
To its apogee, and always has a
Feeling like you're havin' a mental orgasm
Makin' all minds come to one conclusion
You are the best and it's not an illusion

(The best)
(Rockin' my beat)
(The best)

For instance
If this record was an atom, I'd be the nucleus
The center of attention, cool Moe Dee and I'm just
Like the core of an apple, the priest of the chapel
With the mic in my hand I'm like a surgeon with a scalpel
Ready to operate the rhymes that I create
Sounds like music to your ears cause I can combinate
Bass and treble to create a level
Of highs and lows of sounds that goes
With syncopated concrete-created
Beats that meet the standard of a street credit
Gotta critique a rhyme if it's weak
You won't want to speak if your rhymes not peak
With verbs and nouns and adjectives
Combined to make a phrase
That'll play with a beat
Stop and start, slow it down at a part
And totally amaze
The whole crowd, leave em in a state of awe
Cause I'm as perfect as a diamond without a flaw
And yes, I'm legendary, also very, very
Educated, proficient and extraordinary
In my field the other rappers yield
A knight in shining armor and the mic is my shield
In rap I'm vital, the other rappers' idol
The best mc and Moe Dee's my title
But you can call me cool

Now when I rock instead of
Just average I'm better
Than the average man
And that's why I can
Make a real human feel like a manakin
I mean I'm cold heart ? from the time I walk in
I'll shock ya and amaze ya
Hit ya, then I'll daze ya
Either way I'm gonna phase ya
Cause I'm sharp as a razor
When I'm rhymin' to the cut
You know what?
I'm the best MC
Many imitate me
They never would admit it
They just can't get it
I rhyme like the rest
But the juice I possess
Always seems to be more
I'm a rhyme connoisseur
My taste for the beat
Is also elite
I'm the best hip-hopper from off the street
Cause when I'm rhymin' on the mic I always take control
Can't another rapper touch me with a 10 ft. pole

I rhyme a 100 miles an hour
With lightning-speedin power
Make the sweetest of the sweet MC's look sour
Timber as they tower, because I devour
Any other rapper and I can prove it now or
A little bit later, cause I'm a graduator
From a rhymin' alma mater, but some say alma mata
Like you say patata, I say potato
Tomato, tomata, my data's up to data
Cause somethin' is the matter with those of you say dada
Could mean opposite of mama, like the kids at Wonderama
I'm very good at actin', I'm very good at drama
I confuse you with a period, colon and a coma
Cause when I'm rhymin' and I take a pause
You think the rhyme is over but when you and yours
Really check out what I'm doin', then you say ooh
When they say who's the best MC to you
You'll look at me, then you say I know who

If you ever want to battle me, don't move slow
Come and get it cause I'm waitin and I got nowhere to go
Head to head, toe to toe, rhyme for rhyme, blow for blow
We can throw

Badself

When I get busy, the crowd gets dizzy
And when I'm on the stage, the party people say, ""Is he
Really human or is he a robot?""
Because when I'm on the microphone nobod-
why does the things that I do
My voice will guide you
Once you hear it, it stays inside you
Hypnotizing and mesmerizing
The cerebral cortex, but without realizing
You become confused and so enthused
Cause the rhymes I use can make you lose
Total control, and if I choose
To call you the paperboy you'll spread the news
Like Paul Revere: ""A real rapper is here!""
Yeah, ""Moe Dee is coming, Moe Dee is coming""
And teeth will chatter, plagiarism scatter
Nothing is the matter, you're just looking at a
Real rap trooper with a power so super
After battlin me, I guarantee you won't recouper-
ate cause I am great, I can make you hate
To ever look in the mirror and affiliate
Yourself with anything but an average person
Lovin my success but envious and cursin
You want my autograph, don't act like a sucker
Just gimme a pound cause I'm a bad, bad, bad mutha-

Mutha-, mutha-, muthaf-

I put a hurtin on rappers, egos are crushed
Pride is swallowed, asses are bust
Hearts are taken, souls cremated
Lips are sealed and they hate it
Overrated rappers made it
On a wing and a prayer with old beats updated
But I'm not like you bitin barbarics
Rappers with the fresh beats and weak lyrics
I'm cyanide, deadly and lethal
I never run out, I got an automatic refill
I never get cold, I only get lukewarm
When I want to get hot, I have a real brainstorm
Ideas start flowin, my talents start showin
And if the music stops, Moe Dee keeps goin
I'm bigger than life and deeper than death
The world of rap is like a kitchen and I am the chef
Boy, are these MC's really startin to irk me
Make it to the top, then try to jerk me
Ask em who's the best, their shoulders start shruggin
Like they don't know, they must be buggin
But I like the controversy, it makes me blood-thirsty
And one day I'll make them all beg for mercy
So remember that if you want to act like a sucker
Don't ever make me mad cause I'm a bad, bad, bad mutha-

Mutha-, mutha-, muthaf-

I'm the kinda rapper that a dummy won't dig
My IQ's too high, my words are too big
My voice too clear and my rhymes are ample
Some things I won't do, and here's an example
I won't make a 'La-Di-Da-Di', an 'Oh Veronica'
A 'Dear Ivette' or a La-'Latoya'
I'm not tryin to dis the rappers that made these cuts
As a matter of fact I like them, but
Records like that are for the average MC
Not for the highly rated Moe Dee
I have a formula, I'm like a scientist
And I must put words together like this
My voice is a ?????, coming out an orophus
Expressing ?????, verbally or if it's
Mental ??asymetrics?? that makes me so electric
By spontaneous combustion an explosion is expected
A walking time bomb that can't be disconnected
I'm a rhymer with a timer, I'm a english dialectic
My ideas are impeccable, rhymes are paragon
My soliloquy will affect ya like Farrakhan
Love me or hate me, agree or debate me
Watchin suckers gather round, bow down ????? be-
Cause what I do orally I something so morally
Stimulating, emmulating heat that's corally
My mind is both flexible and resillient
Pugnacious, tenacious ??????, I'm brilliant
Through rigorous training, it's self-explaining
Why I'm standing on the top and that's where I'm remaining
My brain rocks like Mr. Spock's
And any other MC's are knocked out the box
So you know where to kiss, so line up and pucker
Sucker MC's, I'm a bad, bad, bad, bad (mutha-)

Mutha-, mutha-, muthaf-

Now I was never solo, I was always in a group
So now you new jacks are a little too souped
So if you think you could take mine
Then come on and make my
Day, you idiot, you knew from the giddy-up
You didn't have a chance
But if you want drop the pants
I spank that ass so fast that the next time you glance
Everyone will be laughin and you'll be the stock
Cause that's what's good about havin you MC's on the jock
I could go on and on and on and on for days
But everytime I speak I get unwanted protegees
If you've been lucky so far, don't press your luck
Cause you don't really want none cause I'm a bad, bad, bad (mutha-)

Kool Moe Dee,"Do you know what time it is?

Girlies are partying, touching my body and
Talking to me like I'm a kindergartian
Today she's on mine, tomorrow she's on his
But don't worry about me, because I know what time it is
Time to get mine while you try to get yours
I'll get mine pause in those silky drawers
Take you to the cleaners and I got a trick
Cause all you're ever going to get is a piece of my dee-dee-duh
Didn't you know that my girlie, my toe
It's easy to come, but harder to go
Hope you got a good heart and you're a good sport
Cause I'm a treat you like beaver on a basketball court
I'm gonna run you around, take you up and down
Take you out and leave you in the lost and found
So if you want to be down, miss listen to this
Before you deal with me, you'd better know what time it is

	Do you know what time it is?  (Tell me do you know?)  (Repeat 3x)

Some girlies are pretty, some girlies are fine
But most girlie girlies like to play with your mind
They like sporting new gold and riding in cars
And most of them, they don't care who you are
They're materialistic and unrealistic
And to most of them you're nothing but another statistic
Whoever's got the money, they're all on his
y'all can save it for David, cause I know what time it is

	Do you know what time it is?  (Tell me do you know?)  (Repeat 3x)
	Check the clock!

Put your Gucci watch on and synchronize the time, and let's rock

Girls for me come a dime a dozen
And that's why I never never was a
Situation where I could get jerked
Like a mechanic, all I do is bodywork
Want my money?  You must be a fool
Cause like Billy Idol said, I'm gigalo cool
Moe Dee, that's me, introduce yourself, miss
But don't try to be slick, cause I know what time it is
Time to make sure that the girlies stay poised
String 'em out so they will always want more
Don't come around here and try to get richer
Don't ask me for no money, cause baby baby baby
Bet you don't know me from a can of paint
And I bet you think I'm fronting but I tell you I ain't
And I bet you think you know, but I'll tell you like this:
I'll be you don't know (Know what?) What time it is

	Do you know what time it is?  (Tell me do you know?)  (Repeat 4x)

It's time to get money, time to get paid
It's time to have fun, it's time to get laid
Like to front like I'm poor, I don't drive, instead
I be chilling in a Jetta with my man that be red
Riding all around the city and half the world
And after talking from girl to girl
All you ladies seem to sing the same old song
Makes it hard for me when a real girl comes along
Now I'm a veteran, a girl all-pro
And as many as I've had, I still don't know
So I made a little system so I can tell
Doesn't always work, but what the hell?
Don't ask me for nothing, and don't give me nothing
And keep it like that for about a whole month and
Half and I'll laugh and maybe one day miss
Maybe you can be down, maybe you can be down
Maybe you should be down cause you know what time it is

	Do you know what time it is?  (Tell me do you know?)  (Repeat 3x)

Well, listen up, homeboys, I got somethin to say
About a homeboy from back in the day
His name was Richard, some called him Rick
But if you knew him like me, you'd call him Dick
When we were growin up, we stuck with each other
Like white on rice, he was kinda like a brother
We had a lotta fun when we were kids
We always overlooked the dumb things he did
But the fun was over when we got to high school
Cause it was time for gettin girlies, so we had to be cool
We had a lotta girlies, and our friends were impressed
One thing went wrong, Rick got obsessed
We wouldn't go to class, always think about ass
Not if he was gonna pass, if he would just last
Girls was all he was thinkin about
If the school was all boys, he'da been dropped out
When he did drop out, he felt no shame
And if you ask me, he had the right name
Cause he hated to go, but he loved to come
That's why I call him Dick, cause Dick is Dumb
Dick

(Dumb Dick)
(D-d-d-do-dumb)

[ VERSE 2 ]
He wouldn't go to school, but he had to survive
So he went out and got him a 9 to 5
Although he was lazy, he had to work
Cause he had a lot of girls, he needed money, the jerk
As fast as he made it, his money was spent
When it came to girls, he didn't care where he went
He'd hound em like a dog, so we used to say ""fetch!""
And it was no tellin what he would catch
He was in the doctor's office almost every week
He became so popular, everybody'd speak
When he walked in they'd say (Hi Rick)
And when he passed by, they'd say (Dumb Dick)
Really hard-headed, cause he said he had juice
But it was cause of his hard head, that he was so loose
He was in love with another girl every day
And when we asked him why, he'd only say
(I'm the kinda guy who likes to have fun
I need a lotta girls, can't have just one)
I can understand that, but this is kind of insane
Sometimes I wonder if his brain
Was his...

(D-d-d-do-do-dumb) (Dumb)
(Dumb Dick)			(2x)

[ VERSE 3 ]
He lost his girl when he lost his job
So to keep himself from livin like a no-good slob
He hustled on the streets, cause he had no choice
And every day you'd hear his voice
Sayin ""Jumbos! I got it good""
But he never made the money that a hustler could
Cause when he was standin out on the corner
If a girl walked by, he was right up on her
He was so hot, his heat couldn't be measured
To him his business was his pleasure
A one-track mind, and as a matter of fact
He changed his name to Daddy Mack
The people on the streets he was workin for
Cut him off, now he's just plain old poor
And all his girls left, because they never cared
The were leeches for a dollar, and they got their share
Homeboy disappeared like a magic trick
And everybody want to know what happened to Dick
Well, he's still around, but now he's a bum
Chasin bag ladies, he's the same old Dumb

Kool Moe Dee,"What are you crazy, you know who I am
(Moe Dee!) yes, I'm the man
I am the flyest, cleanest, baddest, meanest
Rapper that walks the streets
My rhymes are always on point
Smooth as an ointment
I mitigate any beat
I'll take you where I want to go
I sound slick when I kick it on a slow tempo
And if you ask if there's someone better than Moe
Like Luther Vandross, they'll say, 'don't you know?
Really, really, really don't you know?'
Cause I'm a real rap warrior, Elite Astoria
I'll take on 104 of ya
Highest paid rappers if they put up the plucks
And I'll prove that they're all ducks
Cause I don't care nothin 'bout your money and gold
Don't want to hear about how many recrods you sold
Cause none of that don't mean nothin to me
Cause I'm 'the greatest' - but not Ali
I'm cool Moe Dee

What are you senile, have you lost your mind?
I'm the greatest rapper of all time
If they had a rapper's hall of fame, bein that it's all a game
I might not be down, because some rappers got a name
From screamin and yellin with hot records sellin
But your rhymes are smellin, that's why I'm tellin
You, when I go, homeboy, I'm gone
Cause I'm better but don't get me wrong
There is no disrespect meant, my only intent
Is to get some of that cold cash to spend
Consider rappin as a competitive sport
And we're all enemies on the court
But when the game is over I'll shake your hand
Give ya a pound, cause you're still my man
But if you put both of us in front of a mic stand
Homeboy, it's a new game plan
Cause I gotta disrespect ya, try to disconnect ya
Break you down like a clown cause I'm an intellect, ya
Bird brain rappers I call hip-happers
Not hip-hoppers, cause y'all just happen to
Be on a mic so you can hear your voice
But your rhymes is Dunkenheins, soft and moist
Some rappers are too hard and others too soft
But I'm perfect, I just go off
Because I depict rappin consumately
Cause I'm 'the greatest' - but no Ali
I'm cool Moe Dee

Don't piss me, I know you miss me
So now you think I fell off? Don't diss me
Just use some innovation and close your eyes
And visualize us on the Enterprise
And set all coordinates on the subordinate
Rappers, beam em up, take their minds and broaden it
Set em back to Earth and watch the network
Multiply by mega-millions, you witness a burst
Of a new society, rappers with variety
So much prestige, flair and notoriety
Michael and Prince would seem like small figures
It's hard to believe but think about it, it figures
I personify perfection and my mic is a tool
I make another rapper feel small as a molecule
There's no race no contest, I'll never have to jostle
They're small time, to them I am collossal
I'm a gladiator with the image of a god
I'm powerful but camouflaged
Like Moses had the power to separate the sea
I by the power invested in me
Put words in rhythm, recite em as poem
Put em on records to display em and show em
To an entourage of fiends who are also loyal
Who through their eyes are seeing me as the royal
King that feed the hungry souls
That starve for excitement ????
The Ice Man cometh, cool Moe Dee
The messiah is rated on a higher marquee
I be a god, apex of the hip-hop cult
I'm the leader rhyme breeder, yes, I am the ult-
imate idolized figure, there's not a name bigger
Than cool Moe Dee cause no one has the vigour
That I possess and that's cause I
Really feel that I'm the best, so I personify
Rap to the fullest, I totally perplex
The majority of rappers and they turn out vexed
The other competition because of my position
I don't stop rockin under no condition
I rock non-stop but don't ever fatigue
And many experts in the busines are so intrigued
That they begin to draw conclusion, some askin questions
Is it possible to rock by the power of suggestion?
Well that depends totally on the source of power
And if it's your brain, the answer's of course cause I'm a
Auto-hypnotic, reverse-pschotic
That'll make you feel, if you want it I got it
Every second you spend with me
You know you feel that this is the place to be
Because I depict rappin consumately
I'm 'the greatest' - but not Ali
I'm cool Moe Dee",I'm Kool Moe Dee,1986

Kool Moe Dee,"(Monster Crack)

1986 - return of the horror flicks
More deadly than _The Omen_, a killer and a showman
Like the devil in _The Excorcist_
But this flick can cause a heart attack
Cause it's more than action-packed
It's alive and killin and the star is a villain
And his name is Monster Crack
The crack monster

He talks to ya like he's alive
And when he talks like bees to a hive
The people come runnin, the older and the young'in
The place he lives in is the house they hung in
He wants your money, only your money
He'll make you feel good for a real fast twenty
The bill is passed and the dollars go fast
The feeling is high but the high don't last
Long enough for you to even read a paper
But you still thirst and hunger for the vapor
Although he is an animate, he'll make you feel
That he can breathe, think, talk and bleed for real
You should stay away cause all he's about
Is just makin you broke and stringin you out
It only takes one kiss and a deep, deep breath
Then you're hooked for life cause it's the kiss of death

Like savoir-faire he's everywhere
He'll hook an innocent baby cause he don't care
He loves to eat, girls and boys, and he's nothin but poison
The biggest ????? of Michael Jackson he's makin noise in
The streets he's notorious, to pushers he's glorious
To girls he's a pimp cause he turns em to the whoriest
Materialistic nymphomaniacs
That'll do anything for Monster Crack
Give away her body, steal from her brother
Fight her father or sell her mother
Cause when you're possessed by Crack, God bless
Your soul, cause he'll take the rest

The power of the mind should not be wasted
But the agony of defeat is always tasted
By those who chose to willingly oppose
??????? instead they follow their nose
And the more you get, the more you want
You're killin your brain out, so later on it'll haunt
You you become insatiable, you can't get enough
When your money gets low, things really get rough
It's your only objective, you lose all perspective
On life, you're obsessed, possessed and defective
Losin weight and disappearin but still perseverin
Your body tells you no, but all you're hearin
Is the crack talk

In South Africa many a brother died
Tryin to fight back against apartheid
Bombs are flying, people are dying
Terrorists terrorizing and the whole world's trying
To prevent another war, but I got a surprise
There's already - one right before your eyes
And we're nowhere near, the end this is only the beginning
Until this point the Crack has been winning
Weakening hearts, corrupting minds
A stone cold killer, very easy to find
And once he's caught by the law, he can't go to jail
Cause he's nothin but a little piece of matter for sale
Usin people like pawns in the game of chess
And he is the king, more powerful than the rest

That's right, baby, I run the yard
Got the bass for your bottom, if you feel it in your butt
Do your dance, and I tell you what
When this party is over, there'll be no more rappin
You and I can spread out, and anything can happen
If the party's not enough, and you still think you're ready
You ain't gotta clap your hands and dance, but we can still rock steady

Gettin ready for an all-out war
I'm a lover, that's out to score
I want to see you at the party, we can dance a bit first
And if you really rock your body, we ain't even gotta converse
After the party, all I want to do is come over
And tell you that I want you
And if you don't want to go, just listen to the drums
Feel the beat - and it'll make you come
And don't try to front, cause I'll call your bluff
Don't kick me no bass, cause I got enough
Just let the music keep flowin, watch your head start goin
Up and down, suggestin 'yes' without ever knowin

Different kind of lovin that I call rockin
Oh boy, can I rock? All night long
Cause my rap is strong
I betcha I'll rock your socks
Cause I'm a super lover, undercover
Watch your sister and your mother
Scream, dream, cream, kick, bite and fight each other
I make em drool, cause I'm so cool
I got the tool to rule, and I guarantee you'll
Encounter a night like never before
If you ever walk through my party doors
You come over and over, again and again
And next time you'll bring a friend
Because at my party you gotta be ready
Cause I'm takin no shorts, baby doll, I'ma make you rock steady

Kool Moe Dee,"What you want, you ain't gon' get it
What you need, you won't admit it
It really don't matter how hard you try
Cause money can't buy respect

The material mind is enticed by the dollar bill
It makes some brothers fight, and some would even kill
Some will do anything for a bill
Cause they think they'll get respect

Bought a big Mercedes, and you got about ten more cars
Now you impress the ladies, and you're a neighborhood star
Gold on your fingers and your neck
But you still get no respect

Your mind is weak, so when you speak
You're obsolete, your mental peak
Is in the street, your mouth's a beak
Big like a bird, and your future's bleak
Now you should seek some help decree
You're sellin crack and livin cheap
Bought a brand-new ride to go beep-beep
Playin music outside loud in your jeep
But you should know, unless you're slow
There comes an end to the sidewalk show
And up the river's where you'll go
Wearin stripes from head to toe
No fancy gold, no fancy car
And the brothers inside don't care who you are
A 7-foot brother doin life
300 pounds, says you're his wife
Walks in your cell and says: ""Fix it up""
Then you look up and say: ""Not the butt""
He says: ""Shut up"" ""But... but"" No 'but'
Now what you gonna do, freaky-deaky or what?

The money was good, the money was fast
No business mind and the money won't last
In the money rate you fell first to last
Now every night you fight for your ass
They say what goes up must come down
All hustlers know that sound
Cause you're here today, gone the next
And you'll find out the hard way: you get no respect

[Old hustler:]
	Man, you must be crazy and bugged
	Whatcha mean I don't get no respect?
	You crazy?
        You got to respect me
        Cause I was the first millionaire off the streets, boy

[Young hustler:]
	Aw man, go 'head, shut yo broke ass up, man

Word, I spell it out, I'll yell it out
For those brothers that keep sellin out
Cause local clout is all you're about
A few bullshit bitches and hanging out
And every day's like a title bout
When the next man wants you taken out
I'd like to know what you're thinkin about
It sure ain't dyin without a doubt
But you better wake up before it's too late
Or they'll be doing your make-up down at the coroner's place
And you will have lived just to die
And you'll die with no respect

I never did white lines
I only write lines
And I ain't sniffin' nothing but 
The vapors from hype rhymes
As I start to float
On the rhymes I wrote
Ascending to a level with the gods and I tote
Loads and mounds of people
As they reach new heights
A half-a-mile from heaven is the party site
And I'm the attraction
The ods will be packed in
Coming out of their pockets for me to rock it
And acting
Like they've never ever ever been entertained
They try to act godly but they can't maintain
Aphrodite would freak
As her knees get weak
And Venus would peak
Off every word I speak
Zeus would get loose
Fully induced
I'll make Apollo's ryhmes sound like
Mother Goose
By night's end
Mercury is so hyped
He'd spread the word
That there's a god on the mic

And raise your hands in the air

Made by slavery
Though bravery
We lost
Our unity our source
Of power and we lost
All race pride
In our Holocaust
Now it's my creed
I'm from a stronger breed
My ancestors indeed had to bleed
Whipped 'till they were freed
And now
I look back and say wow
How did we allow
Physical slavery
I just don't ever again
See it now I vow
Pump your fist (3x)
But are we free
In actuality
Let's talk reality
Can't you see
The slave mentality
It's a sickness
That eats you up like cancer
And money's not the answer
Won't advance ya
Don't take a chance ya
Lame 
Selling drugs for fame
That's the weak man's game
It's a shame
You got the chains on your brain
You're givin'
Drugs to kids and livin'
Half your life in prison
God's for givin'
But you got to work with him
Pump your fist (3x)
Distortion confusion
Equality illusion
Justice collusion
No racism delusion
History erased it
Lives wasted
Victory tasted
Drugs face it
Knowledge wisdom
Educational system
Blurred vision
Lies dis 'em
Voice loud
Black proud
Truth vowed
No sellouts allowed

Driving down the highway 
Girlies behind me
Jockin' blindly
No need to remind me
Who I am I know you know me
Stop screamin' and yellin' and pointin' I'm low key
No I ain't got no time for a picture
But slide your number 
And I'll get wit ya
You want to ride 
Ya shouldn't of said that 
You played yourself
And I know where your head's at
Drive my car don't make me laugh
You better settle for an autograph
Or a hug and a kiss on the cheek maybe
But I ain't trying to make no baby
Forget all the silly rumors you heard
Here's the deal so spread the word
No, 
I ain't got no girlfriend
No,
I ain't buy no car
No,
I ain't got no babies
A lot of ladies
Naw, they want money
And I can see'em a mile away
And when they push up
I just smile and say
Back up off me
Smell the coffee
You're screamin' and plottin'
And I'm killing you softly
Watchin' you melt from the second I kiss ya
Hear dollar signs in your careless whispers
I know the game it's old and lame
You're holdin' a flame for my name and my fame
Livin' like Givens schemin' on Tyson
But she got lucky cause he was a nice one
But I ain't nice and I don't play that
If it ain't tax I don't pay that
You think you're in cause you turn me on

No,

No,

A lot of ladies
Naw, they want money
The police I'm givin' them fits
A young brother in a Benz legit
I don't sell no drugs and take no shh
Park my ride and the ladies hit
So many ladies the cops had a hint
They took me in cause they thought I pimped
Jetted from the station back in a flash
They had nothing on me but cold cold cash
Ladies they all want to get with
The man with the money
So they want to get with
The microphone master
And ride shotgun
So people can see ya
And think I got one
No sorry nothin's happenin'

If girls keep lyin' and crashin' my party
Ya'll gonna make me hurt somebody

Since the day I was born I was on a mission
Never played out of position or wishin or missin
I came out kissin, was no spankin the backside
Just lots of lady nurses waitin for black eyes
I - I was talkin way before I could crawl or walk
And what the ladies heard, wasn't baby talk
I'd drop a line like a bomber would drop a bomb
Highly explosive, but notice, I was cool and calm
Ready for action, at the age of 1 the fun
Was just beginning, I was winning, the ladies would come
With arms open and hopin for a kiss and a hug
I stripped down, huh, and watched the ladies bug
I stood up for a while, then I started walkin
I heard the ladies say, ""Look who's talkin""
That's right, baby, you can leave me alone
Cause if you can't please me, don't tease me, cause I'm bad to the..

As a teen I was on the scene cleaner than clean
Mean lean fighting machine with self-esteem
No dope, crack, coke, flat broke I'm not
Sell smoke, nope, nope, won't smoke the pot
Gettin high off life was more than enough
And peer pressure ain't pressure when a boy is tough
And I was tougher than tough, I'm from the darkside
And hangin out in the park and in the parkside
Play a brother in any game he wanted to play
For fun or money, for money if he wanted to pay
I wasn't diggin for niggas, so brother, dig deep
If one got over, it's over, I let the kid keep
A little change, it's strange, he want to bet it back
I took his claim to fame, he want to get it back
And when the night was over I took his girl home
I dimmed the lights and showed her that I was bad..

[ VERSE 3 ]
Now I'm in my 20s with plenty money and honey bunnies
20s and 10s, drive a Benz, you can't take nothin from me
Cause I came up on the streets, a straight up poor boy
But I beat the game, but it was war, boy
Because the streets entice you for the wrong things
I couldn't pay the price, I wrote a song theme
And from the moment I touched the microphone
It was known that I was bad to the bone
But weak rappers and a lack of promotion
Made the job hard, I had to throw some
Weak lyrics together, just to get paid
'Go See The Doctor', and I got played
The train continued to the 'Wild, Wild West'
I heard some brothers say, ""He ain't the best""
Huh, but check the records that ain't well known
And look around and see all my clones

On turntables I'm able to start a movement
And when I move the crowd, the ladies move with
Fire in the eyes, the eyes never lie
So feel the fire and desire, keep your eye on the prize
Ladies, listen to the man and watch me work
Fellas, keep your cool when she goes bezerk

Put you on the streets wit ya jingling hoes
Keep talking about me and I'll keep pimping
Just bring me that money and take this last whipping

You're young and dumb and quick at the tongue
You high strung bum come and get done
I'll do you wit a death blow

Kill 'em kill 'em
I'll hit ya wit a death blow

My lyrical beatdown will leave ya in a coma
'Cause you can't hang without a high school diploma
Your brain of fatigue, you're out of your league
You're running out of gas and you're tank is on E
Somebody buy him a heart 'cause he's petro
Take you're whipping like a man brother let go
No apologies, tears of violence
Get your black suits 'cause I ain't smiling
I'm shooting the gift of gab, brother you're ripped in half
Soon as the mic is past, you won't live to laugh
If there's laughter, I'll get the last one
You loafed on the lyrics and you caught a bad one
So who's got no style, look at your profile
You can't dance, can't dress and you're so foul
Still wearing played out 4 finger rings
Played out fat gold chains and things
You changed your look now change your gameplan
Trying to dress but you still wear name brand
Brother, you look crazy weak
And it gets worse when we hear you speak
So you ain't got a chance in hell
You'll be known as the late LL
The man who lost one, one too often
Came wit a soft one and went to his coffin
A close casket they won't show ya
When I finish, you're mama won't know ya
'Cause I'm a rip you limb from limb
You tombstone read he had no win
So RIP, Rest in peace, rip 'em
D.I.D., dead indeed, did 'em
A H-I-T, hitman, so whatcha hit 'em wit
A rhyme silencer, I hit 'em wit a death blow

If mama said knock me out, come do it
You can't win and that (record scratch) knew it
I'm a send you home in a body bag
Wit the mic in your throat and a jock for a gag
You're out of here, over, finished, all in
And Marly marl can't save you from fallin
'Cause as soon as you came back what did you do
To the break of dawn, another dumb move
You can't go hard, you're just so-so Todd
I'm that type of guy, oh my God
It's gets no rougher comes no weaker
marly hooked the beats so now you need a
Writer to bring you back from hell
Because I'm a rock up L

'Cause I bit that ass to the last stop
I watched you fall like Hitler fell
And now you're down to a broken L
You're records ain't hot and you're shows don't sell
Yo, tell 'em how you fell L, hard as hell
You came back and you thought you had me
But think about it, who's' your daddy

[ VERSE 1 ]
Money - the root of all evil
Follow the dollar, and where will it lead to?
Pseudo science, material math
6 degrees of knowledge, brother, you don't know the half
Symbolizin symbolism, excercisin exorcism
Make a little money, now you want to tell me how you're livin
Suckers sellin what you're sellin, now you're sellin out
The devil sold a dream and you bought it without thinkin 'bout
How the beast will decrease the brain wave
With material thoughts from the crib to the grave
Slaves, got you livin just to die
For the money, lookin sweet, slick and sly
Long as you're ridin and your system's fly
You don't give a damn if your homeboys die
So we gotta find a way to get paid in this system
With or without money - with funke funke wisdom

Funke, funke, funke
Funke, funke, funke...

[ VERSE 2 ]
Women - very significant
Power is what she represents
Contrary to what many brothers believe
Learn the metaphysical meaning of Eve
When you get funke wisdom, then you'll understand
The woman is the driving force for any powerful man
>From birth to earth and earth to re-birth
It ain't a curse, put your thought in reverse
Disperse rehearse your medium, verse first
And understand it ain't a purse that can quench your thirst
For love connections and spiritual conceptions
Not a act of x-rated sex, any 
Man without a woman is incomplete
And vice versa she's obsolete
So I make sure within a part of my system
I got funke funke wisdom

All people are equal, but equal in what?
Once you understand that there's a spiritual math
Add soul to the science and subtract the riff-raff

Fortified with a 144 minerals

Aligned with the 9 planets and combined
To influence the mind and control the whole system

Forget about the lyrics, cause they only want the beat
And other punk brothers put a curse in every verse
Frontin cause nobody taught em how to rhyme first
Frontin like you're hard, but it's only a facade
And now you're goin out like a sucker like Todd
But I can take a rhythm, make you sing it like a song

Excercisin patterns, sowin up the rappin scene
Rockin for the people like a funky rap machine
Synchronize a party cause the party people watch
Only dancin when I tell em cause I rock round the clock
Masters of the ceremony's one and only one
Can rock it like a rocket, phoney homies better run
Cause I'm doin the damage and the damage will be done
Lyrics are the bullets, so I never need a gun
Just a microphone, speakers, tables and a plug
Sit back and watch the people cut themselves and slice a rug
And I'ma rock a party till it's time to bring it home
And when they pull a plug, then I'ma pack a microphone
Put it in my holster like a gun, and then I'm gone
Strapped, ready to rap and on and on and on
I can take a rhythm, make you sing it like a song

At the old school
cool Moe Dee signin off
In the house",To the Beat Y'all,1991
Kool Moe Dee,"Three days later, go see the doctor...

I was, walking down the street, rocking my beat
Clapping my hands and stomping my feet
I saw a little lady so neet and petite
So was so sweet, yes I wanted to meet
So I asked this lady could I take her out
We could wine and dine and we could talk about
The birds and the bees in my waterbed
And you could treat me like a Buddha and bow your head
We continued to talk, and before you knew it
We were at my house and it was time to do it
As soon as I finished, I lost my poise
Ran outside and told all my boys
I said ""Listen up fellas, come over here, bust it""
They said ""Did you get it?"" I said ""Yeah,"" they said ""How was it?""
The poontang was dope and you know that I rocked her
But three days later, go see the doctor

I rocked her to the left, rocked her to the right
She felt so good, hugged me so tight
I said ""Good night""
Three days later...
Woke up fussing, yelling and cussing
Drip drip dripping and puss puss pussing
I went to the bathroom and said ""Mama mia!""
I'm a kill that girl next time I see her
The madder I got, the more I reminice
Why is my thing thing burning like this?
Well I remember the first day I saw that girl
I just couldn't wait to rock her world
I said ""Hey good looking, what you got cooking?""
What have I done stuck my dick in?
Now I know why her ex-boyfriend Dave
Calls her Mrs. Microwave
Cause she was hotter than an oven and I had to learn
The hard way stay in the microwave too long you get burned
But the poontang was dope and you know that I rocked her
But three days later, go see the doctor

I went to the doctor's office, I said ""What have I got?""
He said ""Turn around boy and take this shot""
I looked at him like he was crazy, and I said ""What?""
Ain't nobody sticking nothing in my butt
He turned and said in a real deep voice
""Have it your way, if that's your choice
And I'll put it down if you want me to put it
But don't blame me if it turns into a foot
Extending from the middle of your body
And the next time you see your cute hottie
You won't be able to screw, the only thing you can do
Is just kick her, so go take karate""
As I turned around to receive my injection
I said ""Next time I'll use some protection""
If I see another girl and I get an erection
I'm walking in the other direction
Cause I don't want to do the sick sick dance
So I'm keeping my prick inside my pants
And if I see another girl and I know I can rock her
Before I push up I'll make her go see the doctor",Go See the Doctor,1992
Kool Moe Dee,"I go to work
Like a doctor
When I rock the mic
You got to like
The way I operate
I make miracles happen
Just from rappin'
I'm so lyrically potent
And I'm flowin'
And explodin'
On the scene mean
I got the potential
To make you go
Then chill
I got the credentials
That is of which I chose
To make a rhyme
And chill
Then you know 
I will fulfill
To make a couple of mill
As I build a guild
For all the rappers and skills
And kill the weak rappers and no thrills
Hang 'em an ephigy
If he's a sucker
Hang 'em to the left of me
Cause my right hand man
Is my mic stand and
The microphone that I own
And my game plan
Is keeping at a steady pace
Ain't no need for a rush
It ain't no race
I'ma hit the top 
Just when I want to
And it's a matter of time
And I'm gonna
Cause I know when to
Go 'head enter
The classic Moe Dee rap
That sent ya
Runnin' around
Holdin' ya head
Askin' ya homeboy
Yo man 
You hear what he said
Another funky rhythm
Look at ya man
And give him a high five
Cause I'm live
Runnin' around with him
Telling everybody
Hanging out on the block
It's time to wake up 
And check the clock
Punch it
I go to work
I go to work
I go to work
Like an architect
I build a rhyme some times it climbs so erect
Skyscrapers look like atoms
Cars electrons rollin' in patterns
Writing out word after word 
With each letter it becomes visibly better
Cause my foundation built a nation of rappers
And after I came off vaction
I came to roam
The land I own
And stand alone on the microphone
Daddy's home
Open the door playtime is over
Time to go to work and show the
Suckers in the place who run their face
The base and a taste of who's the ace
Start the race
I'm coming in first
With each verse
I build a curse
So rappers can't capture Moe Dee's rapture
After I got ya
I have to slap ya
Senseless with
Endless rhymes don't pretned this 
Is anything short of stupendous
And when this rhyme is done
Your mind will become
So trapped in the rap
You'll lust on another one
You gotta wait it takes time
I don't write I build a rhyme
I draw plans draft the diagrams
An architect in effect
And it slams
And if it's weak when I'm done
Renovate and build another one
I go to work
I go to work
I go to work 
Like a boxer 
Train the brain and aim
To out fox ya
Like a punch my rhyme knocks ya
Some times it rocks ya
So hard it stops ya
Dead in your tracks
So power packed
Before you can react
You're flat on your back
Down for the count
Get up and dismount
Cause I'm coming
With an endless amount
Of words in a hurry
Like a flurry
A collage to camouflage
The power punch but don't worry
Knowledge is an antidote
I got hand of smoke
Writing at the speed of light with insight
I wrote
Rhymes at a level
So you can't relate
Unless you're intelligent
So stay awake
Sleepwalkers
Slick talkers
This time a native New Yorker's
Riding a crescendo wave to save the mental
State of the fan so he can understand my pencil
Rhymes in its highest form
I'm a drop it on ya like a bomb
When it explodes I'll blow up
A few casualties but so what
If you're slow
You blow
You know you go
I flow
I throw all pro
I go to work
I go to work
To say rap is not work
Is ludicrous
Whoever said it 
Must be new to this
When you hear me
You'll compare me
To a prophet for profit
Not merely
Putting words together for
Recreation
Each rhyme's a dissertation
You want to know my occupation 
I get paid to rock the nation
I go to work
I go to work

Up up up and away
And I'm on
A higher plane 
With a brain
With a flame 
Feel the fire

Possessed by gods
Transferred to man in
A script of a book
A scripture that looks 
Like a Biblical writing
Inviting a hook
Of a song sing along with a strong
Subliminal
Message divesting all men from 
Criminal
Acts of the Devil
Revealed and reveled
Designed to recline the mind to lower level
With no spiritual level

And I'm witted
Hard beats a torch
And I lit it
Stop the music

I'm heating up
I feed off knowledge
And can't get enough
Knowledge is infinite
Suckers ain't into it
Ignorance is bliss
And they're kin to it
Party and dance
And don't ever glance
At a book or look
For their mind to advance
Caught in a rut
Chasing butt
Trying to get a dollar
Or trying to get a nut
Evil feeds 
Off a source of apathy
Weak in the mind
And of course you have to be
Less than a man
More like a thing
No knowledge you're nothin'
Knowledge is king

A meak mind anorexic
You can't hang without slang
So eject it
I've selected
Rhymes for records
To affect the effect
Of the rhyme that left
Hangin' like a pound
That came down
But you're hangin' the brain
So your brain's hell-bound
Lost and found
By the serpent's sound
What you don't know
Can't hurt that's profound
Or absurd
A better word
An ingnorant fool
Is a real cool nerd
Pockets are fat
With an empty head
Got a little fame and a name
And you're brain dead
You count dollars
So ya think ya in
What good is knowing how to count
If you don't know when
And history today
And it will equal the future
Repetitive mistakes
Cause the brain ain't acute ya
Need knowledge
To understand
The concept of sacrifice
But man don't understand
So we have to fight
War
Killing people we never 
Saw before
Most don't eden know
What they're killin' for
Following rulers
Instead of the prophets
The wicked can rule ya
But the knowledge can stop it
Souls can't be controlled
It's a spiritual thing
But you got the knowledge
Knowledge is king
Knowledge
My knowledge comes
From a spiritual force
Stonger than any
Earthly source
Propaganda
Hype or slander
I won't believe the hype
I understand the
Media dictates
The mind and rotates
The way you think
And syncopates slow pace
Brains
Can't maintain
Acertain
Insipid inane crass rain
Insane lame
Traditions 
All praise fame
Positions
Want to be a star
Drive a big car 
Live bourgeios
Ane won't know who you are
Lost in the source
And praising the dollar
Whether your faith is
Christ or Allah
The knowledge of God 
Will teach one thing

I was flying, just like a track star
Dying, nah, I ran through the back yard
Trying to get into my building
Saying, ""Why in the heck won't somebody kill them?""
One day the fellas got together
They vowed that no one would ever
Come on our block, and terrorize us

I said yes yes-y'all, got em off the wall
Teachers tried to teach em, but I got em in the hall
Learning funky lessons, testing, yes, I am the man
Suckers try to second-guess and question if I can
Flowing knowledge, wisdom, power, don't you understand?
I educate and radiate and motivate fam
Showing younger brothers what it is to be a man
By tearing up the party when the mic is in my hand
This is what you call a winter/spring/summer jam
Fall into the mood as the funky music slams
I know you got the rhythm, cause it runs in the fam
I gotta speak my piece, cause this ain't ""Silence Of the Lambs""
I'm here to terrorize, energize, exercise, mesmerize
If some brothers say they beat me, them are lies
Whoever stepped to me and tried to do me got it fast
Homeboy was ancient history, a blast from the past

This is just a blast from the past

[Verse 2]
I said 'rock-rnock, y'all' and knocked-knocked all
The suckers out the box, as I dropped back-calls
For response they responded, the response was overwhelming
From brothers with cool tones, but rookies were yelling
They're selling records by the millions, I was selling tapes
Giving parties in the park, and we never made papes
Rhyming from dawn till dust till dawn
6 a.m. and we was just getting warm
Heating up and beating up on some dead wrong
Brother on the mic who thought he had it going on
Talk on the mic with no poetical style
He was dogging it like he's a pathetical child
To grab a microphone a brother had to have juice
If he couldn't produce, we said he couldn't get loose
Today we would say the brother just couldn't flow
And he would be like history, homeboy would have to go

[Verse 3]
I said peep-peep, y'all, a total recall
Drop the funky lyrics on ya like free-fall
Watch the 'Funky Drummer', dancing to the drummer's beat
Cutting up 'Apache' while they're dancing in the street
And 'More Bounce To the Ounce' for the Funkadelic
Tear the Roof Off the Muthasucker', let the party rip
The funky 'Breaking Bells' took you to the 'Mardi Gras'
A slice of 'Paradise', and it was off to 'Shangri-La'
A cut of 'Space Funk' made you come down to earth
And 'Life On Mars' was the beat that gave birth
Style I possess, the rhythm I test
The message that I stress, the topics I address
The yes to the yes to the y'all I profess
I'm more than a man, but never nothing less
Cause me and the mic is like Osiris and his calf
I'm dropping funky light with the blast from the past

Move, make a move, anxiety's too
Intense and I'm tense and I gotta be smooth

Have brothers have stepped to you with conventional lines
Like ""Glad that we met,"" ""Don't I know ya, don't I know ya?""
Some brothers might win, and others might blow ya
Her kiss from an open fist, what a bliss
But I think hard cause I don't wannna miss
Cause this ain't a game and it ain't no joke

Go to cruise control and let the auto rule

As I take aim at the lame rap game
Ain't it a shame? (rap is goin crazy)
The lyrical skills (are gettin kinda lazy)
The gift they're shootin (couldn't even graze me)
Most rappers deliver enough rhythm and givin em
Limited lyrical play, gee
Now who drops rhymes for the mind, only a handful
Only the deaf, dumb and blind brothers stand still
While hundreds of maniacs sit back and kick that
Lyrical madness, flip that and get back
To funky rhymea with the flow like a lyricist
Connectin lines like a poet, I'm tired of hearin this

Only generic lyrics satisfy the mundane
Shorties with forties, and shortly after the blunts came
Brothers were buzzin and never noticed it wasn't
Nothin lyrical, hear it till the market started floodin
Dozens of fictional gangsters, nothin against your
Fake lifestyle, but your rhyme style tends to
Get repetitive, cause it's inedited you think it's better with
Explicit illicit lyrics - but like a sedative
The rhymes ain't hype, so the crowd lost sight
They shift the focus to flavor and what a brother's flow's like
So here come the flow, the lovable, huggable, colorful flow
The brother that glows, in the dark, cause out of the darkness I rose
So many new flows, I froze my foes and everyone knows
The cons and pros of steppin to Moe, the highs and lows

But if he had a funky track and a fat hook, he'd get props
Treated like some kind of hero, most of em come no where near Moe
If you call them number one, I know that I got to be zero
I come before the one, I'm second to none
I come in the circumference 360, as if the infinite sun
Chained to the Most High, you know the rhyme's most fly
I could survive and come alive when most die
I change the scene, I flips the scripts
I wrecks the sets, I sinks the ships
So one shot, aye captain, I hate weak rappin
Brothers thinkin they're mackin, so I pimp-slap em
Showin em who's large in charge, runnin em up outta dodge

To reek havoc in the ghetto, y'all go head on
Keep runnin with God like a runnin rebel
Doin my thing, kid

(What's all this rhymin about God
What you're tryin to do, man?)
Hey yo, I'm doin my thing, kid
(You a reverend or something?
Tryin to be a preacher or what?)
I'm doin my thing, kid
(Give it up with the preachin God
Just rhyme, just rhyme)
Hey yo, I'm doin my thing, kid
(Alright then, flip the flow, change your flow
Be like somebody else)

I'm true to the game, so I keep inventin
Hype rhymes for the times and I'm representin
Kick flavor while I'm eatin up the best of em
Then put em in the pile with the rest of em
When I flip it and hit it, some brothers don't get it
They want me to kick it like others - forget it
I tailor-made a style for the microphone
You can search the rap files but it's mine alone
I won't get in to fit in the flow, it's won't simulate
Now bein one of the best causes them to hate
The freestyle master cause I'm a outcast
You ever stop and ask yourself how to outlast
All those before me and the many that came after
The critics who dissed this I dimiss with laughter
Ain't no puzzle, put a muzzle on their face
And watch the hype crowd sing
I'm doin my thing, kid

(Man..
Alright, I see what you're doin
I can get with that)
Hey yo, I'm doin my thing, kid
(I kinda like that, yo
Go ahead and do yo thing, kid)
I'm doin my thing, kid
(Yeah, yeah, I dig it, I dig it
Go ahead, do your thing)
Hey yo, I'm doin  my thing, kid
(Hit me with one more and let em know where it's comin from)

I worked with Sugarhill Gang, Run and Heavy D
Eric B., Big Daddy Kane and Public Enemy
>From '79 to '94, now that's longevity
You got a problem with the flow, here's a remedy
Just sit back, relax, in fact, try to hear it
Cause I'm comin back to back, you gotta wear it
Ain't no sense goin against the grain
Get yourself a surf, dude, ride the wave
Cause this ain't the regular style, ain't no competators, I'll
Take out the negative while just like a predator I'll
Prey and on play on and stay on the airwaves
You heard I'm fallin or fell, chalk it as hear-say
Ain't no defense mechanism or criticism
Capable of doin no nothings here, that's how I'm livin
You can bring whatever you got to bring
I'm the champ, the master, the king
I'm doin my thing, kid

(Yo Moe, you all that, man
You gon' go far, man)
Hey yo, I'm doin my thing, kid
(I'm not lyin, you gon' make it to the top)

Look, look, look, look...
Look at me, cool as I want to be
Fly as they come beside of some want to-be
One of the chosen, if you're chosen, then go into
Rhymes that change the time, as it grows into
Riches, itches, switches your whole lifestyle
You're in the spotlight, over night flyin miles
Away, today I'm flyin high
So I give thanks to the Man in the sky
I remember a time whenever a rhyme
Left your lips, it only could get nickels and dimes
But nickels and dimes wasn't enough to eat
So I guess you could say I was saved by the beat
On the street, surrounded by sin
I never sell out, and I wouldn't give in
God said: you can win, look within
See your skin, you're my kin

East to west
Knowledge step, 33 degrees

With sublime rhymes that inclines the mind
Define ancient segments, seek it, speak it, teach it
Keep it, peep it, we get stronger and reap its

Three second later 
I got ya shakin' your head 
Dancin' instead of sittin' 

The rhymes kick 
The beats hittin' you 
Just like a home run 
Slammin' like a slam dunk 

Riding the wave that James Brown gave funk 
It happened to James like it happened to me 
How you think I feel to see another MC 
Gettin' paid usin' my rap style 

And I'm playn' the background meanwhile 
I ain't with that 
You can forget that 
You took my style 

I'm takin' it back 
I'm come back like, Return of the Jedi
Sucker MC's in the place that said I 
Could only rock rhymes 
Only rock crowds 
But never rock records 

How ya like me now
How ya like me now

Now brothers are riding me 
Like a pony 
I'm no phony 
I'm the only real macaroni 

Playin' the mic like it's supposed to be played 
New jacks, you all shoulda stayed 
Out of the business 
What is this, amateur night at the Apollo? 
Get off this stage, I'm in a rage 
I'm like a lion that's been trapped in a cage 

I'm the real king

I never understood, how could one go 
To a party, watch me, stand around and jock me 
Become a rapper, then try to rock me 

Scheming like a demon, you're screamin' and dreamin' 
I'm from the old school, I used to see men 
Dies for less, but I'm not living that way 
I'll let my mic do the talkin' 
And let the music play 

How ya like me now 
How ya like me now

Rap is an art 
And I'm a Picasso 
But of course 
Why else would you try so 

Hard to paint a picture, and try to get ya 
Self in my shoes, but they won't fit ya 
I'm bigger and better, forget about deffer 
Every time I rocked the mic, I left a 
Stain in your brain that will remain 
Stuck in the back of your brain till you see me 
Again, respect, 

I come correct 
The rhymes I select are nothing short of 
Vernacular's pure and I can insure 
Life of death with my breath, my voice is a cure 

I heal life from the words I spread 
I'll make a sick man rock on his death bed 
Sucker MC's , I'll make your girl say ""ow"" 
She's jockin' 

How ya like me now
How ya like me now 

It irked my nerve 
When I heard 
A sucker rapper that I know I'll serve 
Run around town sayin' he is the best 
Is that a test? 
I'm not impressed 
Get real, you're nothin' but a toy 
Don't ya know I'll serve that boy 
Just like a waiter 
Hit 'em with a place of 
These fresh rhymes and 
Make sure that he 
Pays the bill, and leave him standin' still 
When he's had enough, hit him with a refill 
And for dessert it won't be no ice cream 
I'm just gonna splatter and shatter his pipe dream 
Make him feel the wrath, beat him and laugh 
Then when I finish them, I'm gonna ask him 
Who's the bests, and if he don't say Moe Dee 
I'll take my whip and make him call himself Toby 
Put him on punishment just like a child, then ask 

Whip him good, then I'll make him sweat 
Talkin' about battles and never had a battle yet 
But if we ever did 
How could you beat me 
You're so petrified 
Even scared to meet me 
My word's the law 
That's why you don't beef 
You're nothing but a punk, track star, and a thief 
So I'm puttin' you on punishment 
Just like a child 
Never touch another mic 

How ya like me now 
How ya like me now

I could continue 
There's more on the menu 
But relax 'cause I'm so far in you 
You had enough 
I know you're overstuffed 
If I keep going 
You'll be throwin' up 
Old rhymes, I used to say 
Back in the day 
When you used to me 
To my parties and pay 
Nobody's ever gonna rack me

Reporter: So, tell me... How do you feel about 'Jack the Ripper'?

[Evil Thriller laughter]

(Get him!)

[Verse 1]
Want me to get him? Well I got him
My mouth is an Uzi and I shot him
With the hundreds of rhymes and rhythm designed
To make him rewind, this time I draw the line
He's mine...just chill
Don't nobody touch him 'cause Imma get ill
The boy's phony as a three-dollar bill
And this time I shoot to kill
Just like a sucker you took the bait
Now you're like a dead fish on my dish, too late
So party people kick your feet up, I'm about to heat up
You're hungry for a battle, now it's time to eat up
Boy, I'm gonna chew you, 'cause I knew you was
Talkin' that junk, punk, now Imma do you
The way you should be done, call you my son
Make you say ""Daddy, I don't want none""
I've had enough of you actin' tough
You huff, puff, grab your stuff you cream puff bluff
Talk about a battle, but you don't want to do it
You got yourself into it, you blew it
You egomaniac, I'm a brainiac
You came back with a stone cold plain attack
Your rhymes are weak-wack, how can you speak that?
You need to sneak back to the drawing board Jack...
The Ripper, down with my zipper
You get paid to be a Moe Dee tipster
Tryna knock the way I rock, get off my jock
Imma knock you out the box, let's go...

Let's Go!

[Verse 2]
Put up or shut up, get up, yeah what up?
Huh, get on the microphone and get cut up
Talk about how your records went double platinum
With those lyrics?! Huh, I laugh at them
So you got paid, take the money you've made
Bet it on yourself, are you afraid?
Money talks, B.S. walks
When I stalk like a hawk a victory is chalked
So put your money where your mouth is, you don't know about this
Battlin's for real men, and I doubt if
You can even hang or give a run for the money
You're just a sucker, and it's funny
How you never ever had a drop of juice in New York
And now you go on tour and try to talk that talk
You try to act like you're a big man, but you're a big fag
Stridin' and hidin' while ridin' my big man
You ain't got a chance in the world
Your records were smokin', but you sound like a girl...
[How you like me now? I'm gettin' busier
I'm double platinum]  Hold up, is he a
Man or a girl? What in the world?
You sound like Cheryl the Pearl
And you want to battle me on the microphone?
Leave that crack alone, let's go...

Let's Go!
I said, Let's Go!
Come on, boy! Let's Go!
Better than me?

[Verse 3]
Picture that with a Kodak
I don't take no shorts and you know that
I roll hard, run the rap yard, put up your guard
I don't get even, I get odd, Todd
Always one up on ya
And I tried to warn ya
You slept, you took a backstep
Ruined your rep and wept, you should've kept
Your mouth shut, you know what?
You gotta say you're sorry  [I'm sorry]  So what?
You call me a punk, you want to see who's soft?
Put the microphone down, let's square-off
You need a hand, you got hands for
Tryna be me, now LL stands for
Lower Level, Lack Lustre
Last Least, Limp Lover
Lousy Lame, Latent Lethargic
Lazy Lemon, Little Logic
Lucky Leech, Liver Lipped
Laborious Louse on a Loser's Lips
Live in Limbo, Lyrical Lapse
Low Life with the loud raps, boy
You can't win, huh, I don't bend
Look what you got yourself in
Just usin' your name I took those L's
Hung 'em on your head and rocked your bells
Now, here we go, blow for blow, let's throw
Rhyme for rhyme, yours and mine, and yo
When it's time to battle rhyme I know
How to make it flow, so let's go
To the ring, rapper's sing and swing
Words and verse, see who deserves to be king
Serve a blow to that ego
As if you didn't know, let's go...

Let's Go!
Let's Go!

[Verse 4]
How can you say you're the best?
Get put to the test in front of a million and fess
Tried to withdraw because you saw
The juice I got's not like before
Huh, I'm formidable, unforgettable
You're submittable, you look pitiful
Yeah you're headstrong, but you're dead wrong
want to survive? Stick with the love songs
Take off your shirt, flex and flirt
And leave the real hard rhymes to the hard rhyme experts
If you don't, boy you'll get hurt
Feel like dirt and have to revert
To comin' on stage butt naked
To make up for what you can't do on record
Open your eyes twice the size and realise
I'm on the rise and you're on the demise
Ostracized by my reprise
Step in my face and watch how that head flies
I mean business and I'm serious
I ain't sellin' out and now here he is
Frontin' and fakin' and talkin' about makin'
The money from money, now don't you know they can
Use your support 'cause you've got caught
Signed, sealed, delivered, sold and bought
A puppet on a string with no heart
A fool and his money will always part
You used to be a rapper, turned into a businessman
Loafin' on the job and cheatin' the fans
I'm too potent, powerful and spiritual
Mental, emotional, physical and lyrical

and iron out our quarrels
and try to live as brothers.
And try to find a piece of land
without stepping on one another.
And do respect the women of the world.
Remember you all have mothers.
We got to make this land a better land
than the world in which we live.
And we got to help each man be a better man
with the kindness that we give.
I know we can make it.
I know darn well we can work it out.
Oh yes we can, I know we can can
Yes we can can, why can't we?
If we wanna get together we can work it out.

And we gotta take care of all the children,
the little children of the world.
'cause they're our strongest hope for the future,
the little bitty boys and girls.

[ VERSE 1: Ice-T ]
Ice-T, let me kick my credentials
A young player, bred in South Central
L.A., home of the bodybag
You wanna die, wear the wrong color rag
I used to walk in stores and yell: ""Lay down!""
You flinch an inch - AK spray down
But I was lucky cause I never caught the hard time
I was blessed with the skill to bust a dope rhyme
All my homies died or caught the penzo
Lost their diamonds, cops towed their Benzos
Livin that life that we thought was it
Fast lanin, but the car flipped
I'm not gonna lie to ya, cause I don't lie
I just kick thick game, some people say: why?
Cause I'm back on the block, I got my life back
So I school the fools about the fast track
I get static from the style of my technique
Profanity, the blatant way in which I speak
But the Dude knows the streets ain't no kiddie game
You don't know the Dude? Quincy's his first name
He told me: ""Ice, keep doin what you're doin, man
Don't give a damn if the squares don't understand
You let em tell you what to say and what to write
Your whole career'll be over by tomorrow night
Rap from your heart, and your heart's with the street
Rap on my record, man, Kimiko, send Ice the beat""
The Dude is def no doubt, what can I say?
The man can roll with Ice-T or Michael J

I'm back, on the block, on the screen
I'm on the wax, I'm on the stage, I'm on the scene
I'm on the case, just like an attorney
The Dude took me on a magic journey
To dance in France, alone in Rome
On the farmlands of Nebraska, the cold of Alaska
The heat of the motherland
To be with my brotherman
On top of a snowcapped mountain I'm scoutin
What another man saw in a race of people
To see him give his life for the price of equal
The highest wisdoms, the richest kingdoms
The Song of Songs we heard David sing them
He showed me me when I was young and hung out
He showed me makin love, even showed me strung out
He showed me poppin nines, standin on a rock
But tears came to my eyes when he showed me my block

Back up and give the brother room 
To let poetry bloom to whom
It may concern or consume
As I reminisce before this
The bliss that exist
But now we brought about a twist
Cause I remember of my people bleedin
Put through slavery and killed for bravery
We shoulda got our freedom much sooner
You never seen a blackman on _The Honeymooners_
But now somehow we've learned to earn, to grow, to show
The elevation of a people built is so
Jesse Jackson, Miss America a black one
No more livin for just a small fraction
I was once told by the Dude that knowledge is a food
To nourish, so to conclude
This from an Asiatic descendant, Big Daddy is shocked

[ VERSE 4: cool Moe Dee ]
An everlasting omnipresence is my present
State of being, seeing the unpleasant
Sight of righteous souls live like peasants
The mind stunts growth in adolescence
My insight enables me to enlight
The weakest of minds, and I put em in flight
As I transcend, a-scend or de-scend
Re-create, re-incarnate and re-send
The powerful spirits of our ancestors
For those that don't know how God blessed us
Because man messed up, the media dressed up
Lies perpetrated as truth, and it left us
Confused, but I've seen it all before

 Girlies are partying touching my body and 
 Talking to me like I'm a kindergartian 
 Today she's on mine tomorrow she's on his 
 But don't worry about me because I know what time it is 
 Time to get mine while you try to get yours 
 I'll get mine pause in those silky drawers 
 Take you to the cleaners and I got a trick 
 Cause all you're ever going to get is a piece of my dee-dee-duh 
 Didn't you know that my girlie, my toe 
 It's easy to come, but harder to go 
 Hope you got a good heart and you're a good sport 
 Cause I'm a treat you like beaver on a basketball court 
 I'm gonna run you around, take you up and down 
 Take you out and leave you in the lost and found 
 So if you want to be down, miss listen to this 
 Before you deal with me, you'd better know what time it is 
 Do you know what time it is? (Tell me do you know?) (Repeat 3x) 
 Some girlies are pretty, some girlies are fine 
 But most girlie girlies like to play with your mind 
 They like sporting new gold and riding in cars 
 And most of them, they don't care who you are 
 They're materialistic and unrealistic 
 And to most of them you're nothing but another statistic 
 Whoever's got the money, they're all on his 
 why'all can save it for David, cause I know what time it is 
 Do you know what time it is? (Tell me do you know?) (Repeat 3x) 
 Check the clock! 
 Put your Gucci watch on and synchronize the time, and let's rock 
 Girls for me come a dime a dozen 
 And that's why I never never was a 
 Situation where I could get jerked 
 Like a mechanic, all I do is bodywork 
 Want my money? You must be a fool 
 Cause like Billy Idol said, I'm gigalo cool 
 Moe Dee, that's me, introduce yourself, miss 
 But don't try to be slick, cause I know what time it is 
 Time to make sure that the girlies stay poised 
 String 'em out so they will always want more 
 Don't come around here and try to get richer 
 Don't ask me for no money, cause baby baby baby 
 Bet you don't know me from a can of paint 
 And I bet you think I'm fronting but I tell you I ain't 
 And I bet you think you know, but I'll tell you like this: 
 I'll be you don't know (Know what?) What time it is 
 Do you know what time it is? (Tell me do you know?) (Repeat 4x) 
 It's time to get money, time to get paid 
 It's time to have fun, it's time to get laid 
 Like to front like I'm poor, I don't drive, instead 
 I be chilling in a Jetta with my man that be red 
 Riding all around the city and half the world 
 And after talking from girl to girl 
 All you ladies seem to sing the same old song 
 Makes it hard for me when a real girl comes along 
 Now I'm a veteran, a girl all-pro 
 And as many as I've had, I still don't know 
 So I made a little system so I can tell 
 Doesn't always work, but what the hell? 
 Don't ask me for nothing, and don't give me nothing 
 And keep it like that for about a whole month and 
 Half and I'll laugh and maybe one day miss 
 Maybe you can be down, maybe you can be down 
 Maybe you should be down cause you know what time it is 
 Do you know what time it is? (Tell me do you know?) (Repeat 3x)

Kool Savas,"A du mi! Ladies und Gentlemen, hier spricht Moses Pelham, CEO von 3P.
Und ich möcht' die Gelegenheit nutzen um Euch einen 
Meiner Lieblingskollegen zu präsentieren, der,
Wenn ich nur früh erkannt hätte, dass man großen, 
Wahnsinnigen Junkie-Spinnern keinen Teil des Geschäfts überlassen darf,
Sicher heute bei 3P wär'. 
Das ist 'ne traurige Geschichte! Tröste mich, Savas!

S, Du Groupie, wie jedes deutsche Kiddie, das rappt. 
Ich steh' auf um zwölf, ess' Mittag um sechs,
geh' in's Studio, spit' und mach' Tracks, mach' mein Ding. 
Dich am Mikro problemlos zu töten ist gar kein Ding.
Ich bin kein Pop-Rapper, ich bin der Top Rapper, mit Hauptschulabschluss 
In der Tasche ist mein Job Rapper.
Ich mach' mir Sorgen, Deine Freundin ist seltsam, 
Sie bläst dicks wie eine Hure und will nicht einmal Geld haben.
Hobby-Hoe, Du bist im Fick-Business, mach' big Business. 
Ich krieg' Pussy ohne Ende, ich muss nicht mehr wichsen.
Ich flow' besser als Perish damals auf diesem Beat 
und mir geht's besser heute ohne Deal bei Put da Needle.
Was Ihr macht, ist kein Rap, des ist Ambient. 
Ich bin kein normaler Rapper mehr, ich bin der Champion.
Manchmal fühl' ich mich, als wenn ich jemand ermorden will, doch chille, spitte, bringe Rapper zum weinen wie Lauryn Hill, oh!

Ja, geweint hat er dann auch immer, einfach so, ohne jeden Grund.
Aber Du tröstest mich, Savas, Du machst meine Welt schöner,
Du machst Hip Hop schöner. Du bist wunderschön! Mach' weiter so, bitte!

Bitte fuck mich ab, ich brauch einen Grund zum schreiben. 
Mein Flow ist dirty und nasty wie ein Mund voll Scheiße.
Ich komm' zum Battle, spit' einen Vers, fick' Dich im Nu. 
Deine Freundin bläst hart wie auf Didgeridoos.
Du machst komische Moves, weil Du glaubst, Fame ist geil. 
Ich mach's wie Jada.
Gib Money, kiss the game, goodbye!
Tut mir leid, ich bin der King, 
Bin der Boss, bin der Champ, bin der Chef, 
Mein schwächster Vers ist Dein bester Vers.

Trauer, mein Flow ist für Euch nicht nachzuvollziehen, 
Ich versuch nur härter als hart zu spitten und hart zu verdienen.
Ich geb' keinen Fick, ich bin selber mein favourite Rapper. 
Ich bin ein Idol für die Jugend wie H.P. Baxter.
Ich bin nicht Hollywood, greif' mir nicht in's Steuer, mein Freund. 
Ich geb' hier die Richtung an, mein Flow straight Feuer für Euch.
Ich burn' Dich, ich kill' Euch, leg' 
Euch zwischen zwei Sandwich-Hälften. 
Deine Karriere, guck', Dir kann kein Mensch mehr helfen.
Rap', Du Loser, Du brauchst einen exactly Co-Producer. 
Schreib', was Du willst, doch Dein Text ist der letzte Dreck wie die U-Bahn.
Ich spiel' das Game wie Ego-Shooter, allein gegen Euch. 
Du willst nicht mein Feind sein, mein Feund, Homie!

Ja, exactly, Du produzierst das Stichwort, Mann. 
Du weißt, wie's ist, Savas, und 
Du sagst, wie's ist, sehr schön!
Mir geht s schon viel besser! 
Change that beat a one more time, 
Katch Money, tu' was für unseren Clan!
Let s go! S A V! Komm', komm'! 

Sieh', der Mac ist back, ich rippe Mics, spitte Lines. 
Respekt ist was schönes, doch ich will von Euch Fickern keinen.
Ihr hört mein Album und liebt es wie Billy Jean und Beat it. 
Ich komm' und splatter' jeden Rapper am Mikro, meet the Fible.
//Guck', der Beat ist aus Cash-Sampler, ich rap' länger, bring' 
Euch Rap-Banger, F-d-s-Wämmer, des ist Set-Anger.
Spit' so schizo, rhyme so psycho, ich geh' in's Studio, 
Mach' irgendwas, schlag' die Zeit tot,
schlag' Dich wie Eis tot, schlag' Dich am Mic tot. 
Ich bin fame, mein Name ist jeden Tag in der Zeitung.
Ich rap' nicht, ich red' nur, ich bin, wie ich bin, ich kling', wie ich kling'. 
Du klingst, wie ich kling', ich kling' wie der King, ah.
Du bist DJ, ruf' mich an, ich spitt' für ein paar Hundert, 
Laufe durch die Stadt wie der Prinz von Zamunda.
Ihr seid verwundert, fragt dies und das. 
Du bist ein Hater, weil Du zu viel redest, zu viel hasst, oh!

You are never lot, homie, Du bist eine Inspiration, 
Eine Motivation zugleich, Du hast mich gerade inspiriert.
Du motivierst mich dazu nächsten Sommer Geteiltes Leid zwo zu droppen. 
Und was motiviert Dich, mein Freund?

Bitte fuck' mich ab, des ist meine Motivation, wegen 
Euch Idioten mach' ich bald meine erste Million.
Ihr guckt mich an, als wär ich Alien, wie 
Vom anderen Planeten, seit dem Cometen fangen 
Leute an mit mir anders zu reden.
Sie sind alle so nice, so höflich und nett, 
Ich geh' an's Mic und ruf' Fotze und Schwanz, als hätt' ich Durett.
Ich bin der einzige Rapper, den ich kenn', 
Der was kann, der was ist, der was liebt, der was will, 
Der was macht und es sich holt.
Guck', Du bist so stumpf, dass Du nichts mehr merkst. 
Ich spit' wie Bartman, fick' unfassbar pervers.
Ich bin kein Freestyler, ich rappe einen Part und over. 

Wenn ich komme, ist für euch Party over. Go home!
Ich sag' in einfachen Worten, was Ihr im Studium lernt. 
Mein Flow ist Killer doch Ihr seid meine Kugeln nicht wert.
Du läufst verzweifelt umher und suchst nach dem Sinn der Sachen, 
Während ich gerad' dabei bin Deiner Frau ein Kind zu machen.
Ich komm' in ihr und auf ihr, komm', wann ich will, 
Wie ich will, wo ich will, komm' in ihr Face auf Klo, wenn ich will.
Egal, ich hab' Dir nichts mehr zu sagen, Du Punk. 
Merk' Dir einfach nur meinen Namen, du Punk! S A!
Ja, A du mi!",Transatlantic,2002
Kool Savas,"Sieh, der Mac is, back,
Ich rippe Mics und spinne Lines,
Die jeden Ficker in der Mitte teilen,
Wie auch immer du heißt, auch immer du rhymst,
Mein Flow ist euch Kids leider immer zu weit,
Hängt euch rein, strengt euch an,
Bildet Truppen zum Battle werdet zerstückelt, kämmt euch dann,
Ihr kennt Deutschland, keiner ist zufrieden,
Außer mir, denn mich kann am Mikro keiner überbieten,
Ihr wollt mitreden, mich dick haten,
Ihr könnt auf die Bühne kommen, mein Dick kneten,
Ich ripp jeden, Beat der läuft, freak du Toy,
Ziel und erschiess' den Teufel,
Du hast miese Freunde, miese Bräute, schlechte Karten,
Allen Grund Stress zu starten,
Doch, für dich ist jeder Text zu schade,
Denn, ich gewinne mit nur einer Textpassage,
Du kannst, mies flown und kläglich rappen,
Mädchen battlen, und bist zu jedem eklig nett,
So als Mensch ein Puto,
Auto ein Lupo, Essen ein Frufro,
Und so wieter, komm um zu scheitern,
Ich bumse weiter, gib dir in den Mund und Punkte einfach,
Ihr seid un-begreifbar wack ohne Skillz,
Ich flow zu ill, kill und mach euch Idioten tillt !

Mund auf und Penis rein, saug' du Schädel,
Ich brauch dich nebenbei auch vor jeder,
Ihr habt leider nichts zu tun,
Und wie Jacko und Kelly nur mit Hits zu tun,
Gib's ruhig zu du willst nichts als Ruhm,
Und bist somit ready jeden Mist zu tun,
Ich, spitt zu true, rhyme zu fresh, flow zu best,
Höre auf, aber komm dann back,
Ripp Tracks die keiner peilt,
Rap bis keiner bleibt,

Ich will bitte kein Teil deiner Cypher sein,
Ihr könnt fronten und haten, doch Fakt ist,
Hir seid nicht ihr selber, sondern in den Lyrics fast ich,
Nimm jedes Mic in der Nähe, verteil Trophäen,
Wenn einer von euch ohne zu wissen den Takt trifft,
Ihr packt nix, habt nichts, nur zeit,
Die ihr nutzt, indem ihr immer wieder künstlich seid,
Ich komm zum Battle und lynch dich live,
Erfülle so deine Wünsche, mit mir zu rhymen,
Ich brauch ein Bar um dich vier-zuteilen, den Rest zu plätten,
Einen Versuch um deinen Text einzurappen,
Ihr macht heute auf Freund, morgen auf Feind,
Ich werd' heute gedroppt, morgen gesignet !

Till ab, tick aus, tue was immer du kannst,
Um mich aufzuhalten, oder lutsch' meinen Schwanz,
Dreh' durch, hate und rede über mich nett,
Oder chill und sag, du bist immer noch der King of Rap,
Laber' Müll und glaub du bist der Beste der Welt,
Doch mein Name leuchtet am Himmel in Neon-gelb,
Versuch mich aufzuholen, klau meine flows,
Werd' reich und groß, kauf dir ein Haus und Boot !

Wir kommen langsam auf die Sachen.
Ihr glaubt Rap sei tot,
Doch ich bemerk', ihr beherrscht jetzt perfekt meinen Flow.
Check meinen Flow, während du keinen Job kriegst und weinst,
Habe ich längst einen Deal bei Optik gesignt.
Ich schieb' Optik und reim', besser als der Rest den ihr kennt.
S ist der Man.
Besser als der Rest den ihr kennt.
Rap der mich lenkt,
Denn ich mach höchstens Fehler im Traum
Und hab irgendwie das Gefühl mich will jeder beklauen.
Ich hab Lyrics für jeden im Raum, für jeden der will,
Du bist mit jedem down, jedem der will.
Rede nicht und chill.
Die meisten meiner Fans sind älter,
Als ich E-K-O, ich represent mich selber.
Du brauchst 60 Helfer,
Um genauso zu flowen.
Ich will endlich Geld haben,
Für ein Haus und Boot.
Ich schau zum Mond, denn er ist ein optisches O
Also tu ich was ich kann, schieb' Optik und flow.
Du bist dope, doch deine Stimme passt nicht gut zum Beat.
Ich kill Crews und Freak, sage danach Ops wie Tweet.
Es geht mal auf,
mal ab,
Doch immer nach vorne. Kinder des Zornes.
Optik, die Gewinner von morgen.

Irgendwann auf dem Cover der Source, wie Ray Benzino.
Irgendwann, kauf ich jedes deutsche Hip-Hop-Label.
Drop wie X, glauben, dass sie Hip Hop lieben.
Manche glauben, die Twin Towers zu zerstören war schlimm,
Doch hört erst hin,
Wie die meisten deutschen Rap-Acts klingen.
Ich bring mit drei Namen gleichzeitig, drei LP’s,
Höre dreimal, ich wär' viel zu tight für’s Game.
Ich fick zehn Crew mit zehn Lines an einem Mic,
Hör zehnmal ich wär' für das Game zu tight.
Geh und schreib hundert Raps, mich wundert es,
Warum wird E-K-O’s Megaflow unterschätzt?
Lad' mein Album runter, lass mich nichts verdienen,
Doch ich bin trotzdem immer besser als ihr Bitch-MC’s.
Komm her, wenn du unsere Flows und Texte liebst. Optik,
Der Rest ist mies, Rest in Peace!

Sieh es ein. Geh heim und fahr dir ONE's LP rein
Oder rewind that Track and bow

Das Game ist nicht mehr, was es war, seitdem ich da bin. Ich hab' es verändert
Sieh wie heute Rap hier auf der Straße ist
Mein Junge, ich seh dich wachsen, bin stolz wie dein Vater
Ich hab' den Weg für dich geebnet als sonst keiner für dich da war
Ich zog das Schwert aus dem Stein, was sonst keiner vermochte
Brachte die Straße in die Charts als ich A rockte
Ich hab' die Tür geöffnet, ihr folgt mir hindurch
Der Bozz zeigt euch, wo es lang geht, Junge, das ist, was ich tue (Ich bin Rap)

Löwen und Bienen, ein Verse wie ein Wald voller schöner Tiere
Und zwar so, dein Hühnchen bittet mich sie jede Nacht zu knallen
Und ich geb’ ihr die Schlange, lass sie singen wie ’ne Nachtigal
Überhart, sprinte los wie ein Gepard
Hol mir schnell ’ne Gazelle, leg sie flach wie ein Rochen
Ochs’ sie wie ein Bock und mach’n Fisch
Schrei „du Affe“, doch das macht mir nichts
Denn im Grunde bis du nur ein armes Schwein, das Menschenkacke frisst
Und der Mensch ermordet Tiere, weil er kacke ist
Und unser Hirn nicht erheblich größer als das vom Dackel ist
Fuck it, ich mach mehr Feinde platt, als ein Tausendfüssler Beine hat
Mein Album kommt wie ein Mammut der Scheiße droppt. (Boom!)
Ich pack das Game am Kragen, wie ein Kraken
Schleuder es rum und lass euch glotzen wie Karpfen
Guck, diesen tierischen Part hier findet sogar dein Papa geil
Der Lion King ist hier, komm und sag’s mir nach wie ein Papagei

Uh ahah
Ihr seid ein gefundenes Fressen
Wir sind hier im Dschungel die besten

Nachts kommen wir aus dem Dickicht raus und schreien

Sieh mich an du kleiner Kackvogel, der Löwe ist back
Komm pruste dich nur weiter auf, ich komm und vögel dich weg
Dies is mein Reich, Junge, du kannst bellen, ich kann bellen und beißen
Ich werd dir zeigen, was es heißt zu reißen
Ich verbeiß mich in dein Fleisch und reiß es raus wie der große Weiße
Ich weiß, dass du es brauchst du kleiner Hosenscheißer
Mein Revolvergebiss, läd jeden Zahn, der bricht, nach
Ich splitte dein Gesicht wie ein Blitzschlag
Ich steh am Ende der Nahrungskette
Und warte mit Heißhunger auf den Tag, an dem du kommst und ich dich fresse
Meine Jungs sind wie Piranhas, gib ihn keinen Anlass
Unsere Gewässer kreuzt du besser nicht, Junge glaub mir!
Ich bin ein Raubtier ohnegleichen mit Zähnen aus Eisen
Und Drüsen voll Gift, das ich spritze in dein scheiß Gesicht
Dir geht der Mut aus und du bist erschrocken
Ich bin geborener Killer, voll in meinem Blutrausch und nicht mehr zu stoppen

Aber ich zieh euch aus dem Verkehr wie ein Grizzly die Lachse
Ich bin wie Gänse auf Achse, such nach 'nem Ort
Wo sich heiße Bienen versammeln, wie Zebras in einer Horde
Ich morde nicht, ich jage dich, beiß dir ins Genick und
Zieh dich auf’n Baum, zernage dich und kau an dir paar Tage, Bitch!
Das sind einfach die Gesetze des Dschungels
Und meine Hunde woll’n nicht rufen, sie bellen nach ihrem Jungen
Jap jap!

Ich hab die Beißkraft eines Alligators
Beiß dich in der Mitte durch, nur um dann zu sehen wie du Affe klarkommst
Lass dein Kadaver für die Geier da, denn ich bin fertig mit dir!
Ich hab’s dir gesagt, du Ratte wirst erbärmlich krepieren
Ich bin gepanzert wie ein Nashorn, geht mir aus’m Weg!
Ich reiß deine Bauchdecke auf, nimm dich aus und geh
Kein Tier das ich zu fürchten habe, Depp ich dominier
Fick dich wie ein Stier, wohin denn dies is mein Revier

Mit diesem Flow, der von dir nicht mehr als Knochen übrig lässt
Ruft eure Truppen, denn ich drop Bomben in der Booth
Bis Napalm auf dich prasselt, als würdest du gerade duschen
Ich lade, schieß und treff dich und back dich
Pack dich auf den Esstisch und ess dich!
Ich mach Klarschiff hier an Bord mit meinen Jungs wie Bush
Du willst nicht mitzieh'n, aber musst, wie 'ne Pussy im Puff
Ihr schießt doch nur in die Luft, extra vorbei
Wir machen's wie die Barbaren, und kommen mit Äxten vorbei
Bald ist dieser Text hier vorbei, aber der Krieg geht weiter
Ich schick euch ABC-Bomben um euer Bewusstsein zu erweitern
Guck, ich fahr über euch wie Ketten von Panzern
Ihr seid nicht nur wack wie am Anfang
Ich schick euch back zu dem Anfang
Mit diesem Track wie ein Anschlag
Ihr wollt, dass wir Respekt oder Angst ham?
No way, ich versenk euch Kecks wie ein Anker
Ich sprüh vor lauter Energie wie Blanka
Dreh ab und geh hoch in der Bucht von Istanbul wie ein Tanker, Boom!

Führe meinen Feldzug in dein Areal
Blut fließt, Junge flieh!
Kein Peace, du siehst den Tod, wenn ich komme, sieh
Dein Körper geht zu Boden bei der Druckwelle meiner Bombe
Ich schlage die Trommeln des Krieges, bis der Stock bricht
Und geb dir auf die Ohren bist du blickst, wer der Bozz ist!
Ich hab dich im Visier, es gibt kein Spekulieren
Ich lade das Panzerrohr und lass dein Scheißlager detonieren
Du willst mich burnen mit deiner Kerze, ich bring Flammenwerfer
Und setz dich in Brand bis dich kein Schwanz mehr erkennt
Sieh mein Mikro hat nicht ohne Grund so viele Kerben
Ich bin Schütze, meine Schüsse sind präzise
Sieh, dies ist Armageddon, Junge, ich hab Sprengsätze die dich
Hart zerschmettern, Junge, glaub mir!
Es wird nicht lustig, wenn der Spaß einmal begonnen hat
Ich fliege über dein Bataillon, Junge, und lasse meine Bomben ab
Nenn mich Achilles, weil ich alleine die Schlacht schlage
Gegen deine komplette Stadt
Der letzte Samurai im Dschungel des Asphalts
Junge, nenn mich Ghost Dog, ich mach jeden von euch kalt!

Und strapse und stell' dich 'ma nachts zu den Schlampen an Straßenrand

Hör' auf und warte mal, nein, ich kann nich, ich lade nach
Und des wird unbehaglicher, als ob die kühle Saison des Jahres naht

Du Futt laberst dauernd, bei dir heißt ein Mal die Stunde, abends Party-After-Hour, Trauer
Ich mach mein Ding, bring' euch Energie geballt wie'n Laser
Du machst Fitness, dann trink' dein Protein-Shake aus 'nem alten Präser

Kommt und ich schlag euch gern wie Malteser
Ein Wort, bitte lass Federn, ich dagegen flow', was, fehlerfrei, was
Jeder Idiot hier glaubt, dass er hype is', nich' mit mir,schweig
Und verneig' dich, wann kommt ihr Schweine zur Einsicht, es gibt nur Einen und sonst kein'

Kool Savas,"Meine Damen und Herrn (Essah Essah)
Ich präsentiere Ihnen heut', jetzt und hier
Den unbestrittenen Schwergewichts-rap-champion (Essah Essah)
Euren besten Freund, den King of Rap, die Eins
Den Chef im Ring, den größten der größten
Halt'! Ihr könnt's einfach nicht mehr ignorieren
Er ist essah als ihr.

Ab heute heißt besser nicht mehr besser, sondern essah
Denn essah beschreibt besser, besser als besser, ich mein essah, als besser
Und darum wäre es essah, wenn du essah wirst
Oder essah noch dich vor den Spiegel stellst und selbst erwürgst
Essah so oder nicht, jetzt ist es essah als davor
Ihr hört diese Zeilen und fragt, was hat S.A.V. davor?
Ich will euch grad' nicht verwirren, sondern alles essah machen
Essah ihr macht das, was ihr könnt und lasst's S.A. essah machen
Ruf essah S.O.S, denn S.A. isst euch alles weg vom Kuchen
Wie die Raupe Nimmersatt 'nen Blatt zu ihrem Dinner
Warte, essah nicht abschweifen Essah ihr S.A.
Klone macht auf flott, Flott alles noch abgreifen
Essah so für euch Mitesser, diese Musik hier existiert nur mit S.A.
Ich konkurriere nicht mit dir, Fickfresse
Und nichts könnt es besser beschreiben als diese letzten Zeilen
Ich bin essah, bleib essah und werd' immer essah bleiben

Wer denkt, er wär' essah als S.A.? Und sag
Wer meint, er wär' essah als S.A.? Und bitte
Wer glaubt, er wär' essah als S.A.?
Bring' ihn her!
Wer denkt, er wär' essah als S.A.? Und sag
Wer meint, er wär' essah als S.A.? Und bitte
Wer glaubt, er wär' essah als S.A.?
Bring' ihn her!

Ich kann nachvollziehen, warum ihr Stress macht
Denn mit jedem meiner Alben geht's für euch direkt runter wie Aaliyahs Cessna
Vergesst mal essah nicht, ihr seid die Saat, die ich bewässer'
Und deswegen gibt es jedes Jahr so viele neue Rapper
Sie finden, S. hot, wollen haben, was S, hat
Mein Style ist für sie wie Jessica Alba, ihnen geht einer bei S. ab
Gut, ihr seid gut, doch es gibt S.A. nicht essah als Tester
Jedoch als eure ausgelutschte Scheiße von gestern
Und ehrlich, jetzt mal ernsthaft ihr versucht mir härter zu gleichen
Als Mary-Kate ihrer Schwester, in Ordnung nicht ganz, aber in etwa
Ich spitt' technisch essah als es sogar Inspektor Gadget kann
Mein Flow ist ein feuchter Traum wie das Video zu Fiesta
Guck' ich werde nicht älter nur essah gibt’s hier, nicht ruhiger nur fester
Dieses Spiel ist mein Labor und ich der irre Professor
Form, formvollendete Texte nach Formeln extra für euch
Doch ihr wisst es nicht zu schätzen, denn ihr wisst es ist nicht essah

Wer denkt, er wär' essah als S.A.? Und sag
Wer meint, er wär' essah als S.A.? Und bitte
Wer glaubt, er wär' essah als S.A.?
Bring' ihn her!
Wer denkt, er wär' essah als S.A.? Und sag
Wer meint, er wär' essah als S.A.? Und bitte
Wer glaubt, er wär' essah als S.A.?
Bring' ihn her!",Essah,2007
Kool Savas,"Wir sind krank und ich mein' nicht den Rap ausm Süden
Ich mein', dass was wir täglich in der Glotze sehn
Das ganze Übel macht uns krank
Doch es reflektiert nur, was wir sind, egal ob Vater, Mutter oder Kind
Wir sind alle, wir sind alle krank
Wären gern' gesund aber wissen nicht mehr wie
Zwischen Lügen, Drogen, Fun, Partytime und Hysterie
Zwischen Krieg, Eltern, Ärger, Arbeit und Psychiatrie
Zwischen wir wollen hier sein und gleichzeitig fliehen
Ist des nicht alles krank?
Doch is' es und wir wissen's
Wir sind kranke, kaputte Menschen im Fernsehen
Und finden des witzig, ehrlich, das ist krank
Vater und Sohn heiraten und schwören sich ewige Treue bei Olli Geißen,
Perverse Scheiße, das ist krank
Mit 13 das erste mal Gang Bang , das ist krank
Menschen töten Menschen für ein Land, das ist krank
Kein Dach über'n Kopf, Manche leben auf der Bank, krank
Keine Hoffnung, Leute saufen sich um den Verstand, krank
Andere bestimmen über dein Leben, das ist krank
Du sagst die Wahrheit, aber sie lassen dich nicht reden, das ist krank
Der eine hat alles, der andere nichts, krank
Einige sprechen nur noch mit Waffen, ist das nicht krank?
Manche verlieren vor lauter Schmerzen den Verstand
Suchen Hilfe bei Ärzten, die nicht helfen wollen, das ist krank
Wir fühlen uns wie verloren, warten auf Hilfe von oben
Lindern die Symptome durch Drogen, obwohl wir wissen
Des ist, des ist, des ist krank

Wie wir hier leben, unsere Verfassung, der ständige Kampf in uns und mit jedem
Das macht uns krank
All' diese Regeln, die Überwachung, Mauern und Käfige, die uns umgeben
Das macht uns krank
Das Glück, nach dem alle streben, wir kriegen's nicht zu fassen
Suchen's vergebens und verzweifeln
Das macht uns krank
Wir hoffen und beten, heben die Waffen und zerstören uns gegenseitig
Weswegen? Denn wir sind krank

Und ich red' nicht von Prothesen und Krücken,
Ich mein' unser Wesen, die meisten von uns sind geistige Krüppel.
Verwirrt, weil uns keiner wirkliche Werte vermittelt
Sie meinen, was wir wert sind, misst sich an dem, was wir besitzen
Is' das nich krank?
Wir werden reingeboren in diese kranke Welt
In der man dich, wenn du gegen das Kranke kämpfst, für den Kranken hält
Keine Entwicklung, wir sind Schafe, folgen den Hirten
Nehmen seine Medizin ein und versprechen uns Wirkung, aber das ist krank
Drogen machen krank, Gier macht uns krank
Keine Liebe innerhalb der Familie, das macht uns krank
Der Hass in uns, den sie schüren, wird zum Geschwür und macht krank
Blut, das wir vergießen, Kriege, die wir führen, machen krank
Was? Eltern erziehen Kinder durch Schläge, das ist krank
Fast niemand ist glücklich mit seinem Leben, das ist krank
Wir sind krank, voller Panik, Ängsten und Wahnsinn
Und fügen uns selber Schmerzen zu um zu fühlen, dass wir da sind
Das ist krank

Beuten Tiere aus, machen sie zu des Menschens Sklaven
Quälen sie, töten sie und essen dann ihre Kadaver, das ist krank
Arroganz, Ignoranz, das ist alles krank
Herzlosigkeit, Neid, Gefühlskälte ist krank
Zwänge, Depression, Volksverdummung, Rassentrennung, wir sind krank
Kennen keine Grenzen, Menschen hassen Menschen, fühlen sich verloren
Suchen Hilfe von oben, lindern die Symptome durch Drogen
Obwohl sie wissen das ist, das ist, das ist krank

Das stimmt nicht, ich respektier' jeden, der nichts kann und was tut
Denn nichts zu können, aber tun als ob, könnt ihr schon unfassbar gut
Wirklich, und könnt ich euch irgend möglich helfen, würd' ich's
Mein Tipp, geht zu Roncalli Records, die suchen noch Clowns in ihrem Zirkus
Diese Zeilen hier widme ich euch tief aus dem Herz'
Und ihr denkt, ich scherze nur, glaubt, ich mein', das alles nicht ernst
Doch das tu' ich, guck' ich fluch' nicht über ihr Gangster-Gehabe
Ihnen fehlt die Eingebung, wie Tastaturen, die kein Enter mehr haben
Sie sind dumm, ich hör', was sie sagen und find's zum Lachen
Was ich mache, lässt sie gleich verstummen
Denn neben mir sind diese Jungs nur Fucker wie Pints
Und ich hab' auf Gerechtigkeit gehofft, aber es gibt sie nicht
denn diese Typen haben meine Musik gefickt, deswegen fick ich sie zurück

Kein Herz, keine Melodie
Womit hab ich das verdient?
Ich hab sie mal so geliebt
Aber sie haben diese Mucke gefickt
Kein Herz, keine Melodie
Womit hab ich das verdient?
Ich hab sie mal so geliebt
Aber sie haben diese Mucke gefickt

Ihr verbreitet Mörderstuss, erzählt von Hörgenuss
Stimmt, ich genieß' die Mucke, die ihr macht sehr
Wenn ich sie nich hören muss
Ich weiß ihr sucht nach Publikum, geht auf Myspace und Youtube und
Tut auf cool und macht 'rum wie sonst, was ihr lauft doch nicht mehr rund
Doch keine Sorge hier kommt S.A. Hawking,
Der Norton Anti-Virus des Raps und stopf' ihre Mäuler in null Komma nichts wie Korken
Ihr wollt nachdem hier was landen, doch kriegt'n Korb und merkt
Ihr seid nich' mehr angesagt wie für ultra-fette Säue 'ne Riesentorte
Ich hingegen mach', was ich will, fahr' meinen Film
Und bin am Schrauben mit den Silben und Worten, Sätzen und Strophen
Euer Dreck kommt wie Briketts in den Ofen, versuch' mich nachzuahmen
Es geht nich', da sich deine Zunge bei dieser Art von Text verknotet
Deswegen klingt ihr doch so primitiv und so barbarisch
Glaubt mir, wenn ich mit dir fertig bin, steht vor deinem Namen ehemalig
Ich muss hier Gerechtigkeit schaffen, ansonsten gibt’s sie nich'
Denn diese Typen haben meine Musik gefickt, deswegen fick' ich sie zurück

Geh', hol deine Gun, dann wär's fair
Doch bis dahin is' das Einzige, was du gewinnst nur Land, man
Guck', euer Gerede macht müde wie der Sandmann
Ob Türke, Russe oder der Rest von Grand Can
Bei jedem finden diese Tracks Anklang
Aber was ist des? Deine Bitch hat 'ne Loch wie'n Schuss von 'ner Pump-gun
Na dann, viel fun, man
Ich an deiner Stelle würd sie am Rand stehenlassen wie'n Wandschrank
Egal, kein Tam Tam, wahrt den Anstand
Meine Texte ficken alles wie Matrosen auf Landgang
Für mich ist Rappen wie wandern, S läuft
Und ich bediene gerne euer Team alleine die Bank lang
Danke an alle, die mein Talent verkannt haben
Heute seht ihr wohl alles anders, wie in 'nem Handstand, oder nich'?

Niemals kriegt ihr mich weg, nie wieder geh ich
Keiner von euch kann's wie dieser Typ ist Da Vinci
Und das hier ist meine Mona-Lisa
Des Original, die Eins, niemals von ihm kopiert
Aber niemals erreicht, ihr meint ihr seid's
Doch kommt nicht ran an Mona-Lisa

Ich renn' durch Beats wie'n Athlet
Ich nehm' Wörter und Silben und kann sie im Takt dreh'n
Des ist 'n Fetisch, ähnlich wie bei Leuten, die auf Leder und Lack stehen
Ich kann mich an meinen Texten nicht satt sehen
Ich hab den übelsten dich-glatt-bügelnden Flow
Alles, was ich rappe, muss zack, zack, zack gehen
Sie wollen mein Album mehr als Miss Milian nackt sehen
Feature mit dir? Ich muss ablehnen
Was geht? Alle nennen dich Kackface
Als würde dein Kopf unmittelbar hinter dem Sack kleben
mich will jeder wie 'ne Wiese plattmähen
mich batteln lass, wie bei nem Liebesakt blähen
Was gees? Ich bin dabei süß wie Natreen
Merke! Ich spieß' sie auf wie Kakteen
Ihr habt mies verkackt, wen willst du besiegen?
Nich' mich, lass' dir 'n Sarg zimmern und Frack nähen, denn

Wie der Prince of Persia und mich fragen
Will ich einen Job als Rapper?
Paar sind gescheitert, nicht paar, 
Viele diese Player waren nicht in der Lage dieses Spiel zu spielen
Deswegen blick ich auf sie runter wie im alten GTA
Schieße auf sie wie in Doom, hoff', dass ich sie nie wieder seh'
Auf diesen Wegen gibt es mehr Gegner als im Survival Mode
Ich stecke sie weg mit diesen Rhymes und Flows
Und spitte so perfekt, par excellence
Das ist mein Wurf vor dem Schluss, die letzte Chance
D'rum geb ich Stoff wie in 'nem Kart mit drei Pilzen
In diesem Spiel hier bildet man sich manchmal die Freunde ein wie in Wilson
Mein Flow lässt dich schmelzen und verbrennt die Schmocks
Ich werd' zum Irren und spring auf sie wie der Bandicot
Ihr gebt Gas, bremst und hockt mir am Hintern, doch kommt leider nicht vorbei
Denn ich bin auf 'nem anderen Level, ihr Schweine

Zieht bloß wieder Leine und folgt eurer Mission wie Lara Croft
Ihr labert oft, doch habt nichts zu sagen, ihr Versager
Ich meine, Verlierer, ihr spielt in den Texten die Gangster
Schiebt euch den Film als wärt ihr gerade in 'nem Action-Adventure
Was auch kommt, ich halt die Pads in der Hand und steiger' mich täglich
Am Ende des Weges fügt alles sich zusammen wie Tetris
Wir spielen dieses Spiel hier mit, übernehmen es wie Cortax
Optik Army, paar Jungs und ein Mädchen wie Mario Brothers
Ihr macht auf Street Fighter doch kommt nie weiter, nicht viel weiter als bis hier
Ich nehm' euch Call of Duty mäßig ins Visier und
Snipe euch wie Moorhühner, diese Art von Schüssen hält nicht mal dein bester Torhüter
Ihr gebt euch geschlagen, bevor das Battle begonnen hat
Für jeder meiner Taten verdien' ich die Medal of Honor

Du hast einfach, was der Rest nicht hat, my man
Was auch immer du dir vornimmst, es klappt my man

Du bist on Top, my man,
Du hast einfach, was der Rest nicht hat, my man
Was auch immer du dir vornimmst, es klappt my man
Mach nur dein Ding und never give up my man
Yes, don´t stop my man
Du bist on Top my man!

Wir fühlen uns einsam und leer
Denken manchmal, dass die gesamte Welt hier gegen uns wär'
Sehen nur noch Regen und Gewitter, graue Wolken am Himmel und in unseren Köpfen
Manche glauben, dass sie kein Glück haben und geben auf
Sind verbittert und nicht mehr bereit für ihr Schicksal zu kämpfen
Wir wünschen uns den Respekt anderer Menschen
Und etwas Liebe und Anerkennung, Hilfe und Wertschätzung
Die Kraft, die wir daraus schöpfen, nichts könnte sie eher ersetzen
Jeder ist ein Gewinner auf seine eigene Art
Durch die Dinge, die wir meistern an jedem einzelnen Tag
Und bist du mal am Boden, geht dein Blick nur noch nach oben
An die Spitze, on Top
Du bist voller Wissen und Kraft, nutze sie tu was
Und auch, wenn du nicht gleich an dein Ziel gelangst
Hab' keine Angst, lass deine Träume nicht un-versucht
Es geht nicht d'rum, was jemand anderes macht
Du stehst nur für dich
Glaub' an dich und du packst jegliche Hürde, sag dir nur

Klopf' den Dreck von deiner Kleidung, steh' wieder auf
Auch wenn es manchmal humpelt, nimmt das Leben seinen Lauf
Auch wenn es manchmal weh tut, halt' den Kopf noch höher
Beiss' die Zähne zusammen, Bruder, denk' nicht an früher
Sieh' nach vorn, blick nicht zurück
Geh' einen neuen Weg, er führt dich vielleicht zum Glück
Kämpf' für deine Träume, gib' niemals auf
Nach den Tiefen, Bruder, glaub' mir, geht es wieder 'rauf
Und vielleicht noch höher, als du jemals dachtest,
Sammle deine Kraft jetzt, denn es wird nicht gehen, wenn du schwach bist
Mach' das was dein Herz dir sagt
Denk an deine Ziele, Schwester, wenn der Schmerz dich plagt (Denk dran)
Und wenn du nicht geliebt wirst, dann lieb dich selbst
Gott wird immer für dich da sein auf dieser Welt
Und hüte deine Seele, sie geht sonst verloren
Lass' die Liebe in dein Herz, es ist sonst erfroren

Du bist on Top, my man
Du hast einfach, was der Rest nicht hat, my man

Auch wenn's dir nicht so vorkommt als ob
Viele von uns sind frustriert und gefangen im täglichen Trott
Und die Routine macht uns müde
Du siehst in den Spiegel, merkst wie du älter wirst
Und denkst an deine früheren Ziele, mach' dich nicht irre
Vielleicht verlierst du manchmal 'nen Kampf
Doch verlieren wir den Mut und Hoffnung, dann verlieren wir ganz
Lass' nicht zu das Negatives dich einnimmt und deinen Kopf verdreht
Denn Übel bringt Übel mit sich, des hat man schon oft gesehen.
Versuch' nicht nur auszuhalten, sondern etwas zu ändern
Die Zukunft ist das, was wir daraus formen mit unseren Händen
Verzweifel' nicht, auch für dich ist ein Weg in Sicht
Es geht immer voran, zöger' nicht, mach' dich auf, fang morgen schon an
Denn Sorgen und Angst lähmen uns und nehmen uns den Elan
Wir sind alle Strahlen der Sonne, keiner ist hier egal
Sei dir bewusst, was du leisten du in der Lage bist,
Gib' all deine Kraft
Bleib dran und mach's und du schaffst es wirklich denn

Mich kann man nicht reduzieren auf die Klamotten, die ich trage oder Wagen die ich fahre
Solange ich noch in der Lage bin zu tun, was ich seit über 10 Jahren unaufhörlich mache
Was ist des? Diese Rapper begraben, des is Fakt

Doch ich würde mich nie mit dem Bösen versöhnen (Ah ah)
Ich ticke anders, du und ich, wir sind noch nicht mal ähnlich im Ansat
So Grund verschieden wie Konkret Finn und die Fantas

Keine Lüge, ich entscheide über siegen oder scheitern
Jede Line trifft um ein Vielfaches präziser als ein Sniper

Ich kill' sie im Alleingang, durch mich wird das Unbegreifliche begreifbar
Bringt, wenn ihr wollt, diesen Flow können nicht mal euer Meister meistern
Sie hören mich und sind versteinert, gefroren wie aus dem Eisfach
Ihre Sinne spielen verrückt, sie sehen mich Dreifach
Des Orakel, mich zu fronten ist politisch unkorrekter als Haifang
Du kommst nicht weiter, neben mir bleibst du für immer 3sat

Ihr wollt's nicht zugeben doch denkt es, ich weiß es
Ich mein es ist offensichtlich, ihr fragt warum des was ich schreibe so geil ist
Und hofft im Insgeheimen, meine Karriere wäre beendet
Doch es geht nicht denn ich bin einfach die Eins ob tot oder lebendig

Hol geh, hol deine Homies ich hol sie runter von ihrem hohen
Ross wieder auf den Boden, lass die Schoten
Ich weiß, ihr wollt dass ich einfacher Rap
Zum Beispiel langsamer, Handzahmer, uhuh
Das ist eher was für die Fitnessfraktion
Komm zu meiner Crew sieh wie ich spitt-in-Aktion
Keiner kann mir das Wasser reichen bis auf 'nen Barkeeper
Was für Konkurrenz ich bin ein komplett anderes Ka-liber
Ihr könnt mich ständig nochmal kopier'n, wie 'ne Wahlwiederholung
Das bringt euch einfach nicht weiter, ich spitt a-giler

Kool Savas,"Entschuldigung, Savas ja was is mit Optik?  (Hey Hey Hey])
Optik tik tik, boom

Groß, klein, kein Ding, alle schieben Optik
Wir, ihr, jeder hier, alle schieben Optik
Wer, wo, egal denn, alle schieben Optik
Alle schieben Optik, alle schieben Optik
Ob Jungs oder Chicks, alle schieben Optik
Außer uns geht nichts, alle schieben Optik
Hände hoch, schreit's mit, alle schieben Optik
Alle schieben Optik, alle schieben Optik

Hier ist er, euer bester Freund Kool S.A.
Ich will diese ganze Welt zerstören, U.S.A.
Oder lieber doch nich'
Ich geb' euch ein bisschen mehr Zeit zum Lernen
Bis ihr alle schreit, des ist Optik
Ich geb's zu, kommt mit uns, folgt dieser Kampagne
Wir machen Party als gäb' es jeden Abend Champagner
Groß, klein, fett, dünn, Jungs oder Mädels, des ist egal
Ihr braucht nur uns wie Premiere
Denn wir liefern euch volles Programm, was die anderen labern
Kann man ihn leider nicht abkaufen wie olles Brot
Setzt mal eure Sonnenbrillen ab, seht die Dinge klar
Plötzlich wird die Szene depressiv, denn der King is' da
Wirklich ihr erstickt in euren xxs Shirts
Du bis nich' ein Rapper, weil du 'nen bisschen Rap hörst
Wenn der Rest dich stört und dazu übel deinen Kopf fickt
Schreit's mit uns Optik, Optik, Optik

Hände hoch, schreit's mit, alle schieben Optik
Alle schieben Optik, alle schieben Optik

Los, hebt die Hände hoch und lasst sie oben
Bis unsere Eltern denken 
""Was sind das denn für Idioten?""
Aber das ist keine Phase, das ist unser Lifestyle, unser Leben
Wie wir uns kleiden, geben und reden, des is' Optik
Gleich wie wenig oder wie viel man hat
Wir schieben mehr Optik als in 'nem Fielmann Shop
Schaut mal unser Team an, eure National-elf
Diese Mucke is' wie beide Hände voller Bargeld
Jackpot S.A.V. euer Rap-Gott
Früher broke, heut' mach' ich Kohle wie Mark Medlock
Mein Flow is' Domestos und ich klinge so berauschend
Jeder Ort, an dem ich gerade bin, wird zum Trackspot
Oder auch zum Headshot wie auch immer
Hauptsache wir dreh'n übertrieben durch wie Sonic der Hedgehog
Ganz gleich, ob allein oder vereint
Schreit's der Welt entgegen or four life

Sie kommen nich' weiter und sind es so Leid
Ihr dachtet wirklich diese Pisse wär' leicht, wie? Weit gefehlt
Doch bringt jeden Rapper, den ihr wollt, einer geht noch
Wir heizen ihm ein, als ob man tausend Tees kocht
Und machen dem Gesocks dampfende D-Loks
Jede Zeile is' Epos und ich spitte weiter bis mein Kehlkopf reißt
Oder ich im Strand in St. Tropez hock'
New Shorts, Shirts und geht doch, stop!
Is ok, Schmock, gib dir paar B-Lock
Zock und komm mal runter bitte

Kool Savas,"Ich kann nicht noch mal reseten, mein Leben zurückdrehen
Wie der Prince of Persia und mich fragen
Will ich einen Job als Rapper?
Paar sind gescheitert, nicht paar, 
Viele diese Player waren nicht in der Lage dieses Spiel zu spielen
Deswegen blick ich auf sie runter wie im alten GTA
Schieße auf sie wie in Doom, hoff', dass ich sie nie wieder seh'
Auf diesen Wegen gibt es mehr Gegner als im Survival Mode
Ich stecke sie weg mit diesen Rhymes und Flows
Und spitte so perfekt, par excellence
Das ist mein Wurf vor dem Schluss, die letzte Chance
D'rum geb ich Stoff wie in 'nem Kart mit drei Pilzen
In diesem Spiel hier bildet man sich manchmal die Freunde ein wie in Wilson
Mein Flow lässt dich schmelzen und verbrennt die Schmocks
Ich werd' zum Irren und spring auf sie wie der Bandicot
Ihr gebt Gas, bremst und hockt mir am Hintern, doch kommt leider nicht vorbei
Denn ich bin auf 'nem anderen Level, ihr Schweine

Sie sagen Rap wär' nur ein Spiel, das ist alles nur ein Game, gut
Ich spiele gerne mit und setze mein Leben
Diese Runde entscheidet und ich hab lange gewartet
Jetzt heißt es, alles oder nichts
Ich kann nicht nochmal starten
Sie sagen Rap wär' nur ein Spiel, das ist alles nur ein Game, gut

Ich will die große Kohle nicht, eure Monopoly Scheine
Spit' eine Todeszeile, sie fallen um wie Dominosteine
Zieht bloß wieder Leine und folgt eurer Mission wie Lara Croft
Ihr labert oft, doch habt nichts zu sagen, ihr Versager
Ich meine, Verlierer, ihr spielt in den Texten die Gangster
Schiebt euch den Film als wärt ihr gerade in 'nem Action-Adventure
Was auch kommt, ich halt die Pads in der Hand und steiger' mich täglich
Am Ende des Weges fügt alles sich zusammen wie Tetris
Wir spielen dieses Spiel hier mit, übernehmen es wie Cortax
Optik Army, paar Jungs und ein Mädchen wie Mario Brothers
Ihr macht auf Street Fighter doch kommt nie weiter, nicht viel weiter als bis hier
Ich nehm' euch Call of Duty mäßig ins Visier und
Snipe euch wie Moorhühner, diese Art von Schüssen hält nicht mal dein bester Torhüter
Ihr gebt euch geschlagen, bevor das Battle begonnen hat
Für jeder meiner Taten verdien' ich die Medal of Honor

Ihr wollt's nicht zugeben doch denkt es, ich weiß es
Ich mein es ist offensichtlich, ihr fragt warum des was ich schreibe so geil ist

Kool Savas,"Du siehst sie auf der FHM, Matador, Praline und Max,
Im Bikini oder Slip manche von ihnen sind nackt,
Sie schauen dich an, und plötzlich wird die peitsche hart
Du legst sie hin und verpasst ihnen einen weißen Bart
Das ist kein Ding, männer machen dis ganz normal
Bisschen Creme an die Hand, und dann ab an den Aal,
Mädels, von unten sieht das aus wie ein Puppentanz
Und wir machen weiter bis dis Lama nicht spucken kann
Wenn dein Freund meint er will nicht mehr bocken für heute, (Hmm?)
Hat er sich vielleicht beim Keulen seinen Knochen gehäutet,
In meiner Schule waren einige gute Bräute und chicks,
Nichts Mathe, ich lernte wie man schleudert und wichst.
Dis ist einfacher als ausgehen, essen und reden
Du kannst aufs Klo gehen und dir nebenbei einen kneten.

Stell dir irgendeine Schlampe vor, phantasier
Und sie ist augenblicklich nackt vor dir,
Und sag gib mir dein
Uh ah ah Uh Uh ah sie will den
Uh ah ah Uh Uh ah sie will den
Uh ah ah Uh Uh ah sie will den
Uh ah ah Uh Uh

Du Triffst sie in der Bahn in der Bar oder allein in der Stadt,
Geschminkt wie eine Hure die dir gern zeigt was sie hat,
Du willst ran, aber sie macht auf schüchterndes Flittchen,
Merk dir ihr face du kannst dir später lüstern ein wichsen,
Du kochst dir dein eigenes Süppchen,
Bist zu hause und hast nichts zu tun,
Mach dich locker und würg dein Huhn
Und bist du ohne Kohle und dazu ein Hässlicher Vogel,
Könnte es sein ihr bleibt immer alleine, du und dein Hobel,
Du holst dir Quelle Kataloge, nicht wegen der Mode,
Schepperst dir einen als wolltest du ins Guinness Buch der Rekorde,
Auch wenn ollen tun als wäre ihre Grotte aus Gold,
Mach dir keinen Ärger, geh dir selber flott an den Dolch.
Nimm dein Glück in die eigene Hand
Schüttel' die Nudel und das Ergebnis kommt wie am Stück aus der Tube.

Lasst uns, kommt mit mir, denn ich schwemm' euch fort an jeden Ort
An den ich will und reiß euch mit mir Wort für Wort.
Buchstabe für Buchstabe,
Mein Flow ist buchstäblich wie Tsunamis die auf euch zu rasen,
Zuschlagen bis ihr in Blutlachen badet,
Drin untergeht und eure Lungen versagen zu atmen.
Manches ist euch zu arg und zu brutal
Oder euren (?) zu arm und zu lang wie Zugfahrten.
Voll am A, wer zweifelt jetzt noch? Du? warte, du Made,
Ich schick dich zurück in deinen Buchladen,
Schließ' dich in ne Schublade. Wie kommst du jetzt noch raus da ha?
Red' nicht über mich! Pass lieber auf deine perle auf wie ne Auster!
Und ich kann nicht mal respektlos sein denn ich hab kein Respekt vor dir.
Dein bester Song kommt nicht mal an den wacksten Track von mir ran!
Du brauchst Werbung und musst künstlich jetzt diesen Dreck forcieren,
Machst Politik und lässt dich wie der Kanzler eskortieren.
Ehrloses Stückchen Etwas, bist innen(?) süß wie Nektar.
Ihr wollt die Wahrheit? Schließ' mich an einen Lügendetektor.
Du kleiner Junge, du Punk, du (??) bist nicht gemacht für diesen Beef,
Das laugt dich aus wie ein Gang durch die Wüste.
Ich hab das Ding hier in trockenen Tüchern,
Und ihr müsst euch mir fügen, denn ich trete übers Ufer in Schüben.
Lass es gießen wie aus Kübeln, geb' euch Typen übel,
Überschwemm' eure Strände, mach dem Hokus Pokus ein Ende.
Ihr hört es komm, es macht


Und ich reiß alles mit: Häuser, Bäume..verwüste das ganze Land,
Steig aus dem Himmel wie Christus und lass euch büßen ihr Punks.
Ihr reulosen Ficker wollt nicht alles gut glauben
Und geht mit aufgerissenen Augen unter in diesen Fluten.
Das ist mehr als Hip Hop, ich bring euch den Zorn Gottes
Und hol mir jeden einzelnen von euch bis ihr (?)
Hit diesen Melbeat in Bestzeit, ich greif dich Motherfucker an wie 'n Haifisch,
Beiß dich tot, zerreiß dich, fress' dich auf und scheiß dich aus du Pfeife.
Und komm mir nicht in die Quere,
Denn ich komm und zieh euch in die Tiefen des Meeres,
Wo nichts herrscht bis auf gähnende Leere.
Zieh mich zurück und warte, lass dich nochmal atmen,
Zerstör dein Hab und Gut, lass dich in Trümmern baden.
Flieh in die Berge wenn du meinst es ist zu früh zum sterben,
Mir ist es gleich,denn jeder geht drauf ob alt, ob jung,
In diesem Moment ist jeder mein Feind!
Denn dieser Flow kennt kein Erbarmen,
Nehm deine Liebste zum letzte mal in die Arme
Und bete noch einmal, amen! Jetzt ist es so weit",Welle [*],2007

Kool Savas,"Ey what's up. Here's the kid 50 Cent.
You are now tuned in to my man Kool Savas.
Optik Boom. Destroy the German Dream, ya heard? G-Unit

Du hast es geschafft, Eko, die Leute reden wieder von dir
Nachdem sie dachten du wärst weg, auf und davon und krepiert
Shit, das ist zu emotional ich bin ganz ruhig rational
Ich geh back zu dem Anfang und sag es dir noch einmal
Erinner dich Ekrem du ludst mich ein zu ´ner Jam
Mein größtmöglicher Fan, mein persönlicher Stan
Du warst noch Ekrem Bora, sexy Kanake, nicht Eko Freezy
Der stotternde Junge, der Schuhverkäufer aus Gleezy, egal
ich nahm dich mit nach Berlin und Mel gab dir die richtigen Beats
Plötzlich warst du ein richtiger Rapper mit richtiger EP
Nahm dich auf Gigs, gab dir dies, gab dir das
Gab dir Kies, gab dir was du brauchtest dachte dieser Junge wird MC
Verließ Put da Needle sprach mit East, West und Universal
Keiner wollte dich, ich verzichtete auf 170 E´s
Ich hab es dir versprochen, ich hab´n Deal du hast´n Deal
Einen Monat später hast du deinen Deal bei BMG
50.000 Euro du hältst es für selbstverständlich
Warst ein guter Mensch und fängst an dich durch das Cash zu verändern
Wolltest alles haben, raus, rauf, so schnell wie möglich
Denn du warst dumm jung brauchtest soviel Geld wie möglich
Wolltest ein Song mit Trooper einen mit Jeanette und mit Vanessa S
Ich musste dich überzeugen das du es besser lässt Valezka meinte nur
Langsam ist Ekrem abgespaced
Verrückt eine Woche später hör ich das sie mit Ekrem schläft
Mit ihm ein Album macht kurz bevor das Album mit Mel zu Ende ist
Nachdem sie bei uns wohnt die ganze zeit aus unseren Händen frisst
Und will das man ihr alles bezahlt
Jetzt ist alles egal, ihr seid broke, aber ich hart, jetzt ist alles im Arsch
Ihr setzt Erfolg über Realness, setzt Cash über Freunde
Eko nimmt Texte von Killa Cam übersetzt sie ins Deutsche
Ich hab dich geliebt doch nicht wie ein Schwuler einen anderen Mann
Wie ein Bruder der für seinen Bruder tut was er kann
Aber du bist nicht loyal, nicht normal, du bist der Fan, nicht Amar
Ich hab leider einmal ein Auge zugedrückt, nicht noch mal
Eko du und ich waren auf einer Stufe immer gleichberechtigt
Aber du machst deine Karierre-Moves immer gleich berechnend
Wolltest Scheiße schwätzen und sinnlos reden, Mel Infos geben
Weil du dachtest so zerstörst du mein Leben
Wolltest nicht mehr raus, aus Angst das Bushido vor dem Haus wartet
Ich musst mit ihm reden, das regeln bevor es ausartet
Er und ich wir hatten keinen Beef, haben uns nicht gehasst
Nur wegen dir ist unsere Beziehung jetzt ein bisschen vorbelastet
Ek ich muss nicht biten wie du, weil bei mir alles flowed
Du bist ein Typ der Lügen verbreitet wie Hannes Loh, du merkst
Es geht langsam runter wird langsam dunkler
Und schnell schnell, back zu dem Untergrund in den Bunker, Shit
Alles was du machst ist reine Strategie und Planung doch hier
Rappen grad über 10 lange Jahre Erfahrung
Ich war wie ein Vater für dich als wärst du aus meinem Samen und
Du willst jetzt gegen mich rebellieren aber warum?
Sohn, nicht so sorry du bist tot
Auch dieses Battle holt dich nicht hoch
Und du hast recht, ich bin fast 30 Jahr'
Aber wo ist jetzt der Diss? Ich peil's nicht mal
Wo wärst du heute ohne Optik? Denk fleißig nach
Jetzt wird der German Dream zum Albtraum, scheiße wa?
Komm zu mir, ich kläre deine Sicht mit ´ner heißen Nadel
Noch ein paar Bars und du liegst still und leise da
Jetzt hat der kleine ´nen Bart ,denkt er wäre eisenhart
Du und Valeska passt zusammen euch fehlt live der Atem
Und Eko hörst du das? Wie ich dich Zeile für Zeile wegbombe
Deine Augenbrauen werden zum „M“ von McDonalds
Lil` Eko dieser Beef macht keinen Sinn
Das ist der King gegen ein Kind, der Track ist wie ein Ding gegen dein Kinn
Das Urteil wird dein Untergang, aus und fin
Ich bin am flowen wie der Wind, lass es raus wie ein Pint
Ich bin kein Hater du kennst mich,
Doch du bist faker als Sentence S
Ist wie die Sonne für dich, komm näher und du verbrennst dich
Diese Flut überlebst du nicht, kuck an mir überhebst du dich
Meinen Flow übertriffst du nicht, nach dem Part übergibst du dich
Was du machst ist nicht korrekt wie Behindertenwitze
Alles was du schreibst ist für mich nicht mehr als Kindergekritzel
Hör was du in Interviews sagst
Leute hassen dich nicht
Weil sie mich lieben sondern für deine Art Eko
Nicht nur weil du scheiße bist sondern so unbescheiden bist
Player Lover Türkenrap oder Gangster entscheide dich
Du weißt es nicht, denn du hast keine Identität
Als wären die Augen geschlossen du weißt nicht wo du grad stehst
Und weißt nicht was du grad redest das Game macht dich krank ne?
Komm ich knips dich aus wie ´ne Nachttischlampe
Und du meinst du hast unsre Jungs zu Optik geholt
Warum hat dein Label dann nicht einen Act auf Optik-Niveau?
Mein Freund du träumst, verrückt vom Schnee, crazy von E´s
Das ist ein Phänomen, was geht vor im Schädel von E?
Du bist des Todes, deine Mutter meinte „Tu meinem Sohn nix“
Ich wollt nicht, doch der Bengel ist zu verzogen mir zu verlogen
Was? Ich hab unsere Zukunft gefickt? Es gibt keine Zukunft für dich
Zumindest nicht als Rapper in diesem Biz
Und das ist alles wahr, ihr könnt mich auch gern vereidigen
Dieser Part hier sind die Fakten aber der nächste wird sehr beleidigend
Nein! Ich muss mich nicht verteidigen,
Ich tu das für die Kids da draußen
Die warten und wissen wollen was Sache ist
Hier ist euer Report
Zeigt mich an denn dieser Track ist wie Mord
Ihr hört den Besten, den King, den rappenden Tony Hawk
Du willst von hinten an den Thron ran aber nein Heuchler
Ich spit und verbreite mehr Panik als Robert Steinhäuser
Und du bist geil auf mein Titel wie Jungs auf das Loch von J.Lo
Machst auf ein mal auf Mann und hast plötzlich mehr Beef als Maredo
Doch ich hab dich gemacht wie Puffy „Da Band“
Und wenn du willst, lös ich dich wieder auf „Click Click Bang“
Aber bitte sag mir eins, Eko was ist bloß mit dir los?
Du bist nicht Mr.Hankey, sag wie kommst du bloß aus´m Klo?
Du warst weg, weit weg in der Popwelt
Der Rapper der Dieter Bohlen den Cock hält. Bald gibt es Kopfgeld
Du bist verrückt, du willst zurück, wer bist du nur?
Warst L.O.V.E und jetzt wieder HipHop du Missgeburt
Du bist einer von ihnen Nina MC, Reen, Cappuccino
Alexey, der Wolf, Eko und Fettes Brot sind alle tot
Rest in Peace! Dies ist eine neue Ära und
Ich bin euer Lehrer, und feuer wie Gewehre und
Du bist sanfter als sanft sanfter als samt
Fuck mich ab und ich mach dir Dampf, zerstör dich voll und ganz Ek

Das game ist nicht mehr fair zu mir und ich kann nichts verkaufen,
heißt im Grunde, leg das Mic zur Seite und geh' fix nach Hause.
Niemand kann mehr eure Platten hören, Lyrics glauben.
Ich rap irgendwas, irgendwie und vertick hunderttausend.
Seh' den Blick in euern Augen er hat nichts zu sagen,
Sätze nur aus Phrasen und sein Album ist bis jetzt nicht draußen.
Ihr könnt reden, doch ich brauch nicht mal mehr zu rappen,
denn die Leute kennen jeden meiner Texte bis ins letzte.
Ich bin nicht der beste, doch kenn' auch keinen besseren als mich
und präsentier' Rhymes, wie Bitches Ärsche in der Disco.
Ihr müsst haten und mich motivieren, noch mehr zu schreiben,
denn ich muss schreiben und euch motivieren noch mehr zu bieten.
Manche fragen ,warum machst du bloß so viele Features?
Aber halbe Lieder fallen mir schneller ein, als ganze Bücher!

Ich reime und packe Texte auf den Tisch, die keiner hat, (Aha)
Komm zu dir und kill den besten Rapper deiner Stadt. (Abou)
Schreib und halt das ganze Game für euch in einer Hand.
Bitches kommen und fronten und gehen wieder klein gehackt.
Ihr habt nix zu tun als Reimer-Satz und hated jeden,
statt ein bisschen Props zu geben oder ganz normal zu reden.
Da euch Texte fehlen, müsst ihr euer Ego boosten
und rappen, weil ihr wirklich glaubt, ihr seid dazu berufen.
Ich flow besser, wenn ich huste, reime besser ohne Zunge
Und hab doppelt soviel Luft wie ihr am Mikro ohne Lunge.
Ich verschicke Wörter klar und deutlich mit dem Mörser
und komm somit in die tief bis in die letzten Ecken in den Dörfern.
Ich bin nett zu jedem Pförtner, aber nicht zu kleinen Bitches,
die glauben, sie ham' Überplan und machen alles richtig.

Kool Savas,"Wichtig ist, du vergiss nicht, da wo ein Wille ist fällt jedes Hindernis
Wichtig ist, du vergiss nicht, da wo ein Wille ist fällt jedes Hindernis

Du bist jung und alles ist in Hektik um dich herum
Und dein Kopf ist gefickt, doch du bist im Grunde frei und gesund
Und kannst entscheiden wohin es geht, was du gerne mal wärst
Auch wenn das Ziel dir noch fern erscheint, der Versuch ist es wert
Guck was du lernst, was du erlebst und später von hast
So lang du nicht auf die anderen kackst oder handelst aus Hass
Ein Leben ist das größte Geschenk, was Gott einem gibt
Zum Beispiel lieben dich deine Eltern, wie du sie auch liebst
Mach dir keine Sorgen, dass niemand da ist, wenn du ihn brauchst
Denn deine Geschwister, Verwandten und Freunde helfen dir auch
Halt immer daran, gib einfach deinen liebsten die Hand
Denn jeder Moment, den ihr verbringt hält für ein Leben lang an
Nix ist so wichtig, wie jede die immer an deiner Seite sind
Ob du reich und dick erfolgreich oder fertig und pleite bist
Der Sinn des Leben ist, deinem Leben einen Sinn zu geben
Statt, klauen und betrügen, Wehrlose schlagen und lügen
Entfern dich von all dem negativen Dreck, der dich bumst
Und sei lieber down mit ein paar richtigen Freunden, anstatt tausend Kumpels
Du kannst, nicht immer cool sein und sauber bleiben am Stück
Doch es versuchen, denn irgendwann kommt alles wieder zurück

Wenn dein Herz keine Spur von Hoffnung mehr hat
Und keiner dich für das, was du tust schätzt
Jeder Tag dem anderen eins zu eins gleicht
Brauchst du noch nicht aufzugeben
Denn vielleicht ist heut' der beste Tag deines Lebens

Lass den Kopf nicht hängen und bleib so, wie du bist
Statt drauf zu achten, was irgendein Fremder meint
So lange du weißt, dass du keinem extra im Weg bist und schadest
Mach was du willst und hol immer das beste aus jedem Tag
Probier' zu sehen, was der andere mag und tu etwas gutes
Und etwas gutes kommt zu dir, grad wenn dus nicht vermutest
Sieh wenn du merkst, das dir irgendwas fehlt und dich etwas quält
Versuch einfach aus dir zu gehen und dich selbst von außen zu sehen
Du könntest ohne Probleme aufhören Tiere zu essen
Und somit ohne Probleme ein paar mehr Leben retten
Du solltest einfach mehr Zeit mit deinen Eltern verbringen
Und somit einfach helfen, deine Familie noch mehr zu binden
Glaub nicht jeder ist gegen dich und ein Hindernis
Sei nett und bescheiden, korrekt und fleißig und du kannst alles erreichen
Hör auf zu zweifeln, denn gestern ist Vergangenheit
Und morgen ein Rätsel, doch heut' vielleicht noch der beste Tag deines Lebens

Wenn dein Herz keine Spur von Hoffnung mehr hat
Und keiner dich für das, was du tust schätzt
Jeder Tag dem anderen eins zu eins gleicht
Brauchst du noch nicht aufzugeben
Denn vielleicht ist heut' der beste Tag deines Lebens

Nicht jeder Tag in meinem Leben war der beste
Doch jeden Schmerz, jede Hürde, weiß ich zu schätzen
Denn eines Tages ist da Licht für jedermann
Auch für mich war's nicht einfach
Das Leben nahm mich richtig ran
Doch wäre ich unten nicht gewesen
Wäre ich heute nicht wer ich bin
Wenn du versuchst, zu verstehen
Egal was kommt, nach vorne gehen
Könnte bald der beste Tag deines Lebens sein

Wenn dein Herz keine Spur von Hoffnung mehr hat
Und keiner dich für das, was du tust schätzt
Jeder Tag dem anderen eins zu eins gleicht
Brauchst du noch nicht aufzugeben
Denn vielleicht ist heut' der beste Tag deines Lebens
Wenn dein Herz keine Spur von Hoffnung mehr hat
Und keiner dich für das, was du tust schätzt
Jeder Tag dem anderen eins zu eins gleicht
Brauchst du noch nicht aufzugeben
Denn vielleicht ist heut' der beste Tag deines Lebens",Der Beste Tag Meines Lebens,2008

Kool Savas,"Mit all den Videos auf MTV
Sagen Leute SAV ist jetzt kein MC
Doch er rippt Mics und flowt
Und wenn ihr stupiden Bitches ihm nicht glaubt kommt zu seiner Show
Denn er rhymed nur aus Liebe
Auch wenn ihm mal nix einfällt
Ist es noch besser als wenn ihr schreibt
Du meinst es genügt im Beat zu bleiben um zu glauben
Man ist Hammer und Dope

Wenn ich rappe will ich nur der freshste sein wie Jadakiss
Und jeden killen, der mein Geld verfrisst um mich danach zu dissen
Da ich jeden Tag Texte schreib und Worte fallen wie Äxte
Trifft mein Rhyme direkt im Herzen, wenn du glaubst du bist der Beste
Ich komm kurz vorbei wie Gäste, doch ohne was zu essen
Sondern Lyrics, die in Muskeln stechen wie ein Haufen Wespen
Binde Rap an mich wie Fesseln
Ich hab kein Interesse an
Wildwestern Kacke und MC's in Fransenwesten
Euer Flow ist endätzend und verbreitet Hirnkrätze
Komm zum Battle und ich brech dich in der Mitte durch wie Plätzchen
Du meinst du bist doper, doch betonst nur wie ein Opa
Ein Stück Scheiße mit zu großem Selbstbewusstsein wie auf Koka
Geh zurück zu deinen Gotha Zeiten, rack Cans und write
Statt brutal zu fronten und für dich zu schnelle Flows zu writen
Rhyme, du Punk, ich steige erst auf einen Block aus Eis
Und komm nach einem Monat wieder um direkt auf dich zu scheißen

Du meinst
Ich bin nicht mehr down und dope, aber
Deine Eltern
Haben ein Haus und Boot
Du brauchst
Weder Fame, noch dir ein Auto zu holen
Sondern Rhymes
Die zum Instrumental passen und flowen

Ihr sagt was ihr macht sei gut
Wo kommt er bloß her, euer Mut?
Ihr glaubt eure Umstände sind blendend
Doch wir werden sehen, wie schnell sich das Blatt wendet
Wenn ihr konstant Weakness verbreitet, bitet
Und zum Dissen verleitet

Du meinst, du bist fresh
Und killst wenn du rhymest aber fällst auch gleich
Wenn nur eine Line dich mal streift

Komm zum Battle, ich zerschlage eure Drecksmetaphern
Und vernichte deine Crew am Mic anstelle „Stan“ zu covern
Trenne Rhymes mit Teppichcuttern, du bist wie Da Brat
Und konzentrierst dich statt zu rhymen nur aufs eigene Geschlecht
Ich zerreiß Crews und laufe durch die Stadt mit einer Schaufel
Um die deepen deutschen Rhymes zu diggen, wenn ich Platten kaufe
Ihr seid inspiriert von irgendwelchen Produzenten
Die nicht in der Lage sind mehr als nur Parliament zu samplen
S der Flow-Champion hindert stumpfe Crews das Game zu entern
Ich rhyme wie der King und dreh MC's den Hahn ab wie ein Klempner
Laß dein Ego kentern wie ein Sack voller Steine
Ihr wollt rhymen, doch ich renn ans Mic wie zwanzig Meter Beine
Meld dich, wenn dein Flow und Timing stimmt und besser klingt
Anstatt brutal zu fronten und dabei behindert sein wie P!nk
Ihr macht Geld mit Dreck wie Limp Bizkit
Ran ans Mic, ihr Bitches
Doch ich rhyme bis die letzte Hook geschrieben, Line gerippt ist

Du meinst
Ich bin nicht mehr down und dope, aber
Deine Eltern
Haben ein Haus und Boot

Kool Savas,"Ey what's up. Here's the kid 50 Cent.
You are now tuned in to my man Kool Savas.
Optik Boom. Destroy the German Dream, ya heard? G-Unit

Du hast es geschafft, Eko, die Leute reden wieder von dir
Nachdem sie dachten du wärst weg, auf und davon und krepiert
Shit, das ist zu emotional ich bin ganz ruhig rational
Ich geh back zu dem Anfang und sag es dir noch einmal
Erinner dich Ekrem du ludst mich ein zu ´ner Jam
Mein größtmöglicher Fan, mein persönlicher Stan
Du warst noch Ekrem Bora, sexy Kanake, nicht Eko Freezy
Der stotternde Junge, der Schuhverkäufer aus Gleezy, egal
ich nahm dich mit nach Berlin und Mel gab dir die richtigen Beats
Plötzlich warst du ein richtiger Rapper mit richtiger EP
Nahm dich auf Gigs, gab dir dies, gab dir das
Gab dir Kies, gab dir was du brauchtest dachte dieser Junge wird MC
Verließ Put da Needle sprach mit East, West und Universal
Keiner wollte dich, ich verzichtete auf 170 E´s
Ich hab es dir versprochen, ich hab´n Deal du hast´n Deal
Einen Monat später hast du deinen Deal bei BMG
50.000 Euro du hältst es für selbstverständlich
Warst ein guter Mensch und fängst an dich durch das Cash zu verändern
Wolltest alles haben, raus, rauf, so schnell wie möglich
Denn du warst dumm jung brauchtest soviel Geld wie möglich
Wolltest ein Song mit Trooper einen mit Jeanette und mit Vanessa S
Ich musste dich überzeugen das du es besser lässt Valezka meinte nur
Langsam ist Ekrem abgespaced
Verrückt eine Woche später hör ich das sie mit Ekrem schläft
Mit ihm ein Album macht kurz bevor das Album mit Mel zu Ende ist
Nachdem sie bei uns wohnt die ganze zeit aus unseren Händen frisst
Und will das man ihr alles bezahlt
Jetzt ist alles egal, ihr seid broke, aber ich hart, jetzt ist alles im Arsch
Ihr setzt Erfolg über Realness, setzt Cash über Freunde
Eko nimmt Texte von Killa Cam übersetzt sie ins Deutsche
Ich hab dich geliebt doch nicht wie ein Schwuler einen anderen Mann
Wie ein Bruder der für seinen Bruder tut was er kann
Aber du bist nicht loyal, nicht normal, du bist der Fan, nicht Amar
Ich hab leider einmal ein Auge zugedrückt, nicht noch mal
Eko du und ich waren auf einer Stufe immer gleichberechtigt
Aber du machst deine Karierre-Moves immer gleich berechnend
Wolltest Scheiße schwätzen und sinnlos reden, Mel Infos geben
Weil du dachtest so zerstörst du mein Leben
Wolltest nicht mehr raus, aus Angst das Bushido vor dem Haus wartet
Ich musst mit ihm reden, das regeln bevor es ausartet
Er und ich wir hatten keinen Beef, haben uns nicht gehasst
Nur wegen dir ist unsere Beziehung jetzt ein bisschen vorbelastet
Ek ich muss nicht biten wie du, weil bei mir alles flowed
Du bist ein Typ der Lügen verbreitet wie Hannes Loh, du merkst
Es geht langsam runter wird langsam dunkler
Und schnell schnell, back zu dem Untergrund in den Bunker, Shit
Alles was du machst ist reine Strategie und Planung doch hier
Rappen grad über 10 lange Jahre Erfahrung
Ich war wie ein Vater für dich als wärst du aus meinem Samen und
Du willst jetzt gegen mich rebellieren aber warum?
Sohn, nicht so sorry du bist tot
Auch dieses Battle holt dich nicht hoch
Und du hast recht, ich bin fast 30 Jahr'
Aber wo ist jetzt der Diss? Ich peil's nicht mal
Wo wärst du heute ohne Optik? Denk fleißig nach
Jetzt wird der German Dream zum Albtraum, scheiße wa?
Komm zu mir, ich kläre deine Sicht mit ´ner heißen Nadel
Noch ein paar Bars und du liegst still und leise da
Jetzt hat der kleine ´nen Bart ,denkt er wäre eisenhart
Du und Valeska passt zusammen euch fehlt live der Atem
Und Eko hörst du das? Wie ich dich Zeile für Zeile wegbombe
Deine Augenbrauen werden zum „M“ von McDonalds
Lil` Eko dieser Beef macht keinen Sinn
Das ist der King gegen ein Kind, der Track ist wie ein Ding gegen dein Kinn
Das Urteil wird dein Untergang, aus und fin
Ich bin am flowen wie der Wind, lass es raus wie ein Pint
Ich bin kein Hater du kennst mich,
Doch du bist faker als Sentence S
Ist wie die Sonne für dich, komm näher und du verbrennst dich
Diese Flut überlebst du nicht, kuck an mir überhebst du dich
Meinen Flow übertriffst du nicht, nach dem Part übergibst du dich
Was du machst ist nicht korrekt wie Behindertenwitze
Alles was du schreibst ist für mich nicht mehr als Kindergekritzel
Hör was du in Interviews sagst
Leute hassen dich nicht
Weil sie mich lieben sondern für deine Art Eko
Nicht nur weil du scheiße bist sondern so unbescheiden bist
Player Lover Türkenrap oder Gangster entscheide dich
Du weißt es nicht, denn du hast keine Identität
Als wären die Augen geschlossen du weißt nicht wo du grad stehst
Und weißt nicht was du grad redest das Game macht dich krank ne?
Komm ich knips dich aus wie ´ne Nachttischlampe
Und du meinst du hast unsre Jungs zu Optik geholt
Warum hat dein Label dann nicht einen Act auf Optik-Niveau?
Mein Freund du träumst, verrückt vom Schnee, crazy von E´s
Das ist ein Phänomen, was geht vor im Schädel von E?
Du bist des Todes, deine Mutter meinte „Tu meinem Sohn nix“
Ich wollt nicht, doch der Bengel ist zu verzogen mir zu verlogen
Was? Ich hab unsere Zukunft gefickt? Es gibt keine Zukunft für dich
Zumindest nicht als Rapper in diesem Biz
Und das ist alles wahr, ihr könnt mich auch gern vereidigen
Dieser Part hier sind die Fakten aber der nächste wird sehr beleidigend
Nein! Ich muss mich nicht verteidigen,
Ich tu das für die Kids da draußen
Die warten und wissen wollen was Sache ist
Hier ist euer Report
Zeigt mich an denn dieser Track ist wie Mord
Ihr hört den Besten, den King, den rappenden Tony Hawk
Du willst von hinten an den Thron ran aber nein Heuchler
Ich spit und verbreite mehr Panik als Robert Steinhäuser
Und du bist geil auf mein Titel wie Jungs auf das Loch von J.Lo
Machst auf ein mal auf Mann und hast plötzlich mehr Beef als Maredo
Doch ich hab dich gemacht wie Puffy „Da Band“
Und wenn du willst, lös ich dich wieder auf „Click Click Bang“
Aber bitte sag mir eins, Eko was ist bloß mit dir los?
Du bist nicht Mr.Hankey, sag wie kommst du bloß aus´m Klo?
Du warst weg, weit weg in der Popwelt
Der Rapper der Dieter Bohlen den Cock hält. Bald gibt es Kopfgeld
Du bist verrückt, du willst zurück, wer bist du nur?
Warst L.O.V.E und jetzt wieder HipHop du Missgeburt
Du bist einer von ihnen Nina MC, Reen, Cappuccino
Alexey, der Wolf, Eko und Fettes Brot sind alle tot
Rest in Peace! Dies ist eine neue Ära und
Ich bin euer Lehrer, und feuer wie Gewehre und
Du bist sanfter als sanft sanfter als samt
Fuck mich ab und ich mach dir Dampf, zerstör dich voll und ganz Ek
Lutsch meinen Schwanz!",Das Urteil,2008
Kool Savas,"Guck, ich will kein Star sein
Ich muss - nicht mal am Start sein
Ich will nur meinen Liebsten nah sein
Führ mein Dasein gerad', wie auf'm Drahtseil
Führ mein Leben tagein, tagaus für die Arbeit
Und ich steh' jetzt hier mit ihr
Am Handy und sie sagt, dass sie mich nicht sehen will und nicht respektiert
Und ich merk, dass es ernst ist, merk, dass sie mich hasst
Und denkt ""Hoffentlich nicht"", und wenn es doch so ist
Will ich, dass du weißt, was auch immer kommt, meine Tür ist immer offen für dich, Mel!
Und die Leute sind nicht normal
Denken ich mach'n Dicken, weil ich im Auto anroll
Hasst nicht mich, hasst die Kids. Ich frag sie nicht, ob sie 'n Autogramm wollen
Zwing sie nicht nur meine Mucke zu hören und meine Shirts zu tragen, zu meinen Gigs zu kommen, meine Platten zu kaufen
Was ist das für 'ne Kacke, ich soll Platten verkaufen und dennoch nichts bekommen, was?!
Und du meinst, du weißt nicht, ob ""Bester Tag"" ehrlich gemeint ist
Denkst du ich schreib das nur um in die Glotze zu kommen? Nein ich find's eher sogar peinlich
Bin nicht stolz, wenn man mich erkennt. Jeder Pisser meint wirklich zu wissen, was man denkt
Geht und redet über Dinge, die er nicht weiß, nicht peilt, nicht begreift
Ihr kennt mich nicht, tut mir Leid
Guck ich schreib diesen Shit bis ihr Wichser weint, bis nichts mehr bleibt
Nichts mehr geht. Mit mehr Feeling als R. Kelly
Mit Azad zusammen auf diesem Beat von Martelli. Was?!

Baby, was sind das für Schmerzen, (was sind das für Schmerzen)
Die ich nicht kannte, weil du nie weg von mir warst? (Baby)
Und Baby, jetzt muss ich merken: (jetzt muss ich merken)
Die ganze Schande. Was hab ich dir angetan? (Was hab ich dir angetan?)

Ihr wollt mich nicht verstehen
Wenn ich sag ""Ich hab nur dieses Leben
Und ich will keine Krisen sehen
Ich will Oben stehen und, Homie, Kohle sehen""
Ich hab zu große Angst vor Morgen, ich
Seh so verdammt viel Sorgen, ich
Fühl mein' Kopf zerspringen und die Hoffnung schwinden
Weil das Licht mir leider verborgen liegt
Sieh mein Engel, du bist Alles für mich
Ich hol den Thron und die Kohle und das Alles für dich
Will, dass du irgendwann mal fühlst, du bist stolz auf mich
Will, dass du Alles hast im Leben und auf nichts verzichten musst
Gott weiß, ich wollte nie, dass du leiden musst
Jetz' fall' ich auf die Knie vor Verzweifelung
Senk mein' Kopf voller Scham, denn ich weiß es tut dir weh
Wenn du siehst, wieviel wir streiten und
Das ganze Hin und Her, will nur in deiner Nähe sein, doch ich bin so fern
Will dir nur meine Liebe geben, doch es ist so schwer
Will dir doch nur 'n Vater sein, doch es wird mir verwehrt, Engel
Und es macht mich krank, ich dreh durch und es macht mir Angst
Ich seh nur ich steh an der Wand
Und verliere den Verstand, weil ich nicht mehr kann, uh
Es ist kein Licht in Sicht, ich bin am Boden und verstehe den Sinn nicht
Alles dreht sich, mir wird schwindlig
Geh mir ausm Weg, ich will mein Kind, ich
Halt's kaum aus, ich dreh durch, wann hört dieser Alptraum auf?
Es tut weh, ich kann es nich verstehn
Ich muss dich sehn, oder untergehn, Baby!

Baby, was sind das für Schmerzen, (was sind das für Schmerzen)
Die ich nicht kannte, weil du nie weg von mir warst? (Baby)
Und Baby, jetzt muss ich merken: (jetzt muss ich merken)
Die ganze Schande. Was hab ich dir angetan? (Was hab ich dir angetan?)

Ich hab' kein Salz für meine Tränen (no no)
Sie fließen nicht, weil sie sich schämen (no no)
Du warst das Salz in meinem Leben (oh)
Kannst du mir nicht vergeben? (Kannst du mir nicht vergeben?)

Baby, was sind das für Schmerzen, (was sind das für Schmerzen)

For every rhyme I write, it's twenty-five to life
My-my-my-my mic check is life or death
For every rhyme I write

Immer, wenn ich rhyme
Steht die Welt kurz still und ich spür' weder Raum noch Zeit
Denn immer, wenn ich rhyme
Fällt die Last von mir und ich fühl' mich auf einmal frei
Denn dieser Stift hier weist den Weg
Und trägt mich täglich ein Stück näher
Und zwar immer, wenn ich rhy-yme
Immer, wenn ich rhyme

lass ich mich fallen, wie in ein smoothes Sofa
Rap ist für mich mehr als Disco und ein altes 2Pac-Poster
Ihr rappt Scheiße über große Knarren, gutes Koka
Ich dagegen guck 'n Wholecar, verstehste?
Immer, wenn ich rhyme
Kann ich atmen, ohne Rap, ich stell's mir hart vor
Ich schreib' es hin, wenn ich mir Luft mache, wie ein Ventilator
Es reinigt mich von innen und es dient als Sprachrohr
Meine Träume, meine Artform, verstehst du?
Immer, wenn ich rhyme hab ich etwas, woran ich mich festhalte
Ich vergesse die Welt wie 'ne gelöschte Festplatte
Ich schlage Schneisen in die Lichtung für die Morgensonne
Mit den Mic, immer wenn die Sorgen kommen
Immer, wenn ich rhyme, heb' ich für kurze Zeit ab und lass' es raus
Sehe diese blaue Kugel von oben wie'n Astronaut

Die Schlinge sitzt zu fest um meine Kehle
Muss den Schmerz besiegen
Hab für manche Krise in meinem Leben einen Vers geschrieben
10 Alben, ich hab immer noch einen Berg von ihnen
(Immer, wenn ich rhyme)
Doch bau' den Berg ab, mit der Hoffnung, die mein Hammer ist
Der Stift wird mein Meißel sein
Und Stein für Stein fällt von meinem Herzen
Und ich fühl' mich bisschen besser danach
Ich blick' nach oben und hoff', morgen wird ein besserer Tag
Immer, wenn ich rhyme ist es wie immer, wenn ich wein'
Gefühle brechen aus, ich finde einen Beat
Der mein Gefühl versteht und sprech' mich aus
In Hypnose text' ich auf'n Blatt Papier, nächtlich auf-
Wacht am 4, mächtig laut, das ist, wie ich ticke, Bruder
(Immer, wenn ich rhyme)
Und wenn ich spitte, blute ich meine Wunde aus, will aus dem
Dunkeln raus und das Schreiben hilft mir unermesslich
Ich will runter, Stress ist für meinen Geist nur Gift
Such' mir 'n Beat und ich greif' zum Stift und flieg'

Immer, wenn ich rhyme

verschwindet die Umgebung im Nebel
Tauch' ich Worte in Farbe, feuer' sie raus in 'ner Fontäne
Erweck' ich Blätter zum Leben, Stifte zum Sprechen
Ich wär' nix ohne Rap
Und ich weiß, ob ihr wollt oder nicht, ihr merkt es
Immer, wenn ich rhyme
Glänzen ihre Augen, schlägt ihr Herz schneller
Ihr bekommt den besten Flow ever direkt vom Hersteller
Ihnen fehlt der Glanz und deswegen leuchtet mein Stern heller
Food for thought, anstatt 'n leeren Teller kriegt ihr
Immer, wenn ich rhyme
Hört ein and'rer damit auf und lässt es, ich versteh's nicht
Ich brauch' keinen Therapeuten, rap es mir von der Seele
Mein Juwel strahlt lupenrein, wie unter Halogenlicht
Augen zu, du kriegst ihn jedes Mal zu sehen
Immer, wenn ich rhyme
Verbann' ich die Kälte nach draußen vor die Türe
Eins, zwo, Mic Check, so klingt uns're Ouvertüre
Diese Mucke ist so einzigartig, so verführerisch, so (Herzpumpen)
Du spürst es

Straight aus dem Bauch entweder schrei ich oder schrei ich nicht
Könntest du mir freiwillig den Wagen geben
Sonst muss ich dich schlagen, treten, das ist mir
Schon immer scheißegal gewesen
Überfahr dich, park deine Scheißkarre in Holland
Könnte einfach so am Zollamt vorbeifahren auf'm Roller
Bring das Weed nach hause, erzähl nix von Weedverkaufen du Fisch
Du kannst viel behaupten, doch du existierst überhaupt nicht für mich

Ja ich bin ein psychopatischer Killer, ein Wahnsinniger

Du hast jetzt Top10 Hits aber dafür hast du so ein Arschloch
Du bist fake, phony und du lügst in deinem Text
Image kann Realität nicht ersetzen wie Cybersex
Dein Produzent bitet Timbaland seinen Sohn
Ganz ehrlich, so ein Arschloch ist verantwortlich für deine Produktion?
Nich dein Ernst, ihr seid sehr behaarte Hinterwäldler
Und im falschen Beruf wie ein pädophiler Kindergärtner
Du machst auf Zuhälter und sagst du hättest 50 Huren
Suchst aber gleichzeitig deinen Penis mit 'ner Wünschelrute

Ist das zu fassen?
Du lachst wenn du große Schwänze in den Arsch kriegst
Doch du bist so bescheuert, dass du dir nichmal über die Konsequenzen klar bist
Dir fehlt die Basis, der Stil und der Flow
Ich und Rap sind wie Friedmann und Koks
Einfach untrennbar, undenkbar wenn es anders wär, gib das Lenkrad her
Du dumme Sau, du wirfst dein bisschen Grips aus dem Fenster
Nein, nicht der Henker, ich bring dich kurz um wie Kiefer und Co
Tu auf cool, doch du kommst nicht an wie 'n Athlet der den Start schwänzt
Und sag, was fürn Feature? Niemals, nein, leck mich doch am Arsch, Mensch!
Ich behandel dich wie im Zuchthaus
Quäl und verhör dich denn du störst mich
Auf dir warn mehr Gays als auf nem Friseurtisch
Und du bist des Wahnsinns, gehst zum Arzt
Weil du nicht mehr normal bist, tust als würd bei dir was gehn
Das is ungeheuerlich, was der mir erzähl
Ich glaubs nich, überhaupt nichts, von dem was er da bringt ist sinnig
Denkt dieser Punk wirklich dass er ein Pimp is? hmm
Was fürn Kerl, dass er nich merkt
Dass seine Bitch gerade mit mir Party macht
Ich hör sein Auto, spuck sie noch einmal an und dann hau ich ab

Dann mach doch deinen Scheiß
Dann Mach doch deinen Scheiß, wir haben
Genug zu tun
Und keine Zeit für euch, wir werden dich auf deinen

Ich mach live on stage die Action, dass die Atzen 'n Gang raufschalten
Doch Fusi kennt den Text nicht, bitte sag nur er soll's Maul halten
Diese Rapfans sehen mich, fackeln nich lang
Und fragen nach Autogrammen, ich bleibe freundlich und sage: Fass mich nich an!
Halt, ich bin eigentlich ja gegen Gewalt, verstehst du?
Doch red jetzt weiter und ich geh dir an Hals, verstehst du?
Homie, komm stör mich wenn ich schreibe
Fick mein Weib bis ich den Text versaue
Der Moment is gekommen, wo ich dir in die Fresse haue
Nix wie weg hier, diesmal schlag ich dir in die Fresse
Homie vertrau mir, guck ich versprech's dir
Dein Jochbein, dein Genick und dein Rückgrat, ich brech's dir
Ihr Affen, was pimpen, rumposen und knete machen, ihr habt nichts zu tun
Doch redet von hustlen, ungeheuerlich

Ist das zu fassen?
Sagt der ungebetene Hochzeitsgast
Nachdem der Pfarrer fragt, ob noch irgendwer was zu sagen hat
Die Gäste und das Brautpaar schauen verstört zu diesem alten Sack
Und er legt richtig los du bist ja nich normal, du Idiot!
Ähm, entschuldigung, wir heiraten hier gerade ?
Ich hab so Sachen jeden Tag
Denn er meint, Liebe hält nicht ewig und dass das Paar da 'n Fehler macht
Doch die zwei nehm sich in den Armen, küssen sich und sagen dann
Liebe lebenslang, wir glauben dran und dieser Mann sagt:

Dann mach doch deinen Scheiß
Dann Mach doch deinen Scheiß, wir haben
Genug zu tun
Und keine Zeit für euch, wir werden dich auf deinen
Platz zurückverweisen, wo du hingehörst du Idiot
Wir haben wirklich schon viel gesehen, doch

Kool Savas,"Ich steh im Raum, eng, heiß, Sachen kleben voll Schweiß
Er beißt, brennt in den Augen und darum blinzel ich leicht
Das Licht scheint von der Decke auf das Blatt in der Ecke
Gehalten fest in meiner rechten Hand wie heilige Zettel
Diese Bäume verrecken nich umsonst, ich geb mein Versprechen
Ich werd sie rächen, ihren Tod durch Reden ins Leben übersetzen
Ich setz an zu sprechen, öffne die Augen beim ersten Wort
Und seh Vocalkabine, Studio, Mikros und drück Record

und die Magie nimmt ihren Lauf, der Alchemist mit den Silben
Die Sätze biegen sich wie Kautschuk, beugen sich meinem Willen
Jeder Vergleich ein Flush, jeder Style ein Ass
Jedes Blatt hier haucht mir unendlich Leben ein wie Leonidas
Nimm mir das und du nimmst mir alles
Und ich mein nich Ruhm und das ganze Zeug
Ich hör die Melodie, die Kick mit ihrem Boom und fang an zu träumen
Und seh die Crowd wie sie laut meinen Namen schreit, Arme weit und breit
Das ist alles zu schön um wirklich wahr zu sein also weck mich nich auf

Auch wenn das alles nur gespielt ist
Auch wenn es hoch und tief ist
Auch wenn mein Glück nur ein Traum ist
Lass mich im Glauben daran, aber weck mich nicht auf!
Auch wenn das alles nur gespielt ist
Auch wenn es hoch und tief ist
Auch wenn mein Glück nur ein Traum ist
Lass mich im Glauben daran, aber weck mich nicht auf!

Ich weiß nicht, hab ich das verdient oder habe ich Gott überlistet?
Das Glück war falsch adressiert, ich frag mich ob's wirklich für mich ist
Ich halt es in meiner Hand, manchmal Angst, dass es leicht zerbrechlich ist
Wie lächerlich, ich lach laut wie Verrückte, weils nichts besseres gibt
Ich kipp den Rest aus der Flasche weg, kauf ne neue, ne teurere
Ne neue Runde aus Freude auf meine Freunde
Wir feiern heute zum dreihundertfünfundneunzigsten mal
Die Erfüllung des Kindertraums vom Träumer zum Rapstar
Und Neid ist natürlich da, aber Neid ist Unsicherheit
Von gebrochenen Herzen, denn ihr Traum wurd noch nicht Wirklichkeit
Doch ich wisch es weg wie Beschlag auf dem Spiegel im Bad
Und trag meine Freude trotzdem nach draussen auf dass sie sie inspirieren mag
Was gibt es schöneres als wenn Liebe erwidert wird?
Was gibt es krasseres als wenn das was ich denke Denkmal durch Lieder wird?
Ich bin gesegnet doch seh das oft nicht, ich Pessimist
Darum auch wenn mein Glück nur geträumt ist, dann bitte weck mich nicht!

Auch wenn das alles nur gespielt ist
Auch wenn es hoch und tief ist
Auch wenn mein Glück nur ein Traum ist
Lass mich im Glauben daran, aber weck mich nicht auf!
Auch wenn das alles nur gespielt ist
Auch wenn es hoch und tief ist

Lass mich im Glauben daran, aber weck mich nicht auf!

Mein treuer Begleiter, ewiger Helfer
Ich hielt an ihm fest, widersetzte mich dem Willen meiner Eltern
Und folgte ihm wie 'nem tonlosen Navi, fand den Weg intuitiv
Den Traum im Hinterkopf während ich nächtelang schrieb
Und ich schlief, um acht als Leiche zur Arbeit, ich sitz am Zeichenbrett
Wehr mich dagegen einzupennen während ich meine Zeilen rap
Und wär es meinem Meister nicht aufgefallen wär vielleicht dieser Track nich'
Wie so viele andere davor, wär das nich ätzend?
Ich denk nich dran was danach ist, stress nich wegen Verkäufen
Denn ich weiß die meisten könnten sich so'n Leben nichtmal erträumen
Kein Rapvokabeltest, ich beherrsch diese Sprache hier fließend
Ich schieß mich nicht ab, bin berauscht von dieser Musik, ich lieb das
Und trotzdem bin ich so rastlos, setz ständig noch einen drauf
Denn ich hab Angst dieser Traum hier könnte enden und ich wach auf
Siehst du die Kids da? Sie wurden groß mit mir und ich wurd groß durch sie
Drum lass mich schlafen in ihren Armen, denn ""It was all a dream!""

Auch wenn das alles nur gespielt ist
Auch wenn es hoch und tief ist
Auch wenn mein Glück nur ein Traum ist

Lyrischer Tampon, saug' das Blut aus euch Fotzen
(Kill) Gegner mit einem(Ill), ihr wärt mich gerne los
Rammt euch bitte ma' zwei Finger trocken tief in die Kerbe (Yo)
Glaubt mir, ich zerstör' euch von Grund auf, ihr Heuchler
Mit 'nem Flow, der noch seltener is' als Jungfrau'n in Deutschland
Während ihr nur dumm schaut und euch fragt' 
""Was bloß los mit ihm? Was geht', wieso hasst er uns?"" Weil ihr Hunde Rap
Wie Unkraut verseucht habt, Mund auf, ihr Träumer
Alle Rapper in ein' Sack, ich hau' stumpf drauf wie Stoiber
Sarrazins Wunderlampe der Türke, der Deutsch kann
Sieh, ich flow' wie Euphrat
Bring' dein Weltbild ins Wanken wie 'ne Kreuzfahrt
Mach mir die Rhythmik zum Untertan, ein lebender Beat
Meine Abschiedsworte Mittelfinger an jeden MC
Nach mir kommt lange nichts mehr
Auch wenn du's nich' messen kannst per Rap-O-Meter
Der Beweis is' sie liegen mir zu Füßen wie'n Bettvorleger

Es wird blutig wie Slipknot und heikel, wenn ich am Mic bin
Der Lightning McQueen des Hip-Hops, ich (Halt') nur für den Pit-Stop
Geh und kritisier dein' Vater, ihr Spacken treibt den Spaß zu weit
Auch Mozart würd' sagen, er hat's drauf wie Kanaken Fahrenheit
Die Quote steht 100 zu 1, jeder Tipp auf mich bomben-sicher
Denn, dass ich Schwuchteln mit Lines eben fick', is' gebongt wie Kiffer
Nicht von diesem Stern wie die Critters, mit Lyrics für zehn
Ihr könnt mich dritteln und ich kling' noch besser als (Zwei) Drittel
Spitte außergewöhnlich, sieh, mein Flow durchbricht den verfickten Trott
Mach' aus diesen Rappern hier Obstsalat, nenn' es Sizzling Hot

I make you pay, fuck what you got to say
You don't wanna see my style like click click pow

Werd Junkie, ich könnt' dich sogar dann nicht mal als momentan missbilligen
Nix Rapper, du bist nur ein junger Depp wie in Jump Street
Meine Aura nennt sich (Lost-)Magnetfeld, ich bin so anziehend
Ihr bester Flow ist mein Minimum, ich und sie is' wie Gold gegen Nickel
Mach Sitz, riskier keine dicke Lippe wie Ripke
Pierce dir die Nippel, mach irgendwas nuttiges
Ich spitte einma' kurz und putte dich
B*tch, LMS jetzt bis dein Mundinneres wie Pudding is'
Ich könnt' auch deine Frau erwähnen im Text, aber tu's nich'
Du bist ein (Sucker), ich lass' dich Dick kau'n
Als hätt'st du 'n Penis im Essen, lecker nich'?
Fronte wen du willst, doch besser nich' Essah, ich
Hol' dich mit nem preußischen Karabiner, du Kammerdiener
Markier' nicht den Harten, du sagst, das ist nur ein Rhyme
Aber die Vergangenheit zeigt, sowas passiert wie Tomaten
Du steckst im Hintern von, tust auf BFF eines Rappers
Trotzdem geben dir Schlampen kein Gesicht wie Daft Punk
Geh und spring auf den Pimmel von, der is' die nächsten Monate Fame
(Muah, muah) Küsschen, ich warn' dich nur ganz ohne Gehate

Nimm nicht den Mund zu voll, du weißt
Deine Liebste kam bei 'nem Deepthroat um, sie is' tot
Und dennoch wirst du viergeteilt wie 'n Peace-Logo
Ich komm' wieder rein in den Kriegsmodus
Spit heißer als Schmiedöfen mit dem Scheiß, der begeistert wie Friedhöfe
Gib mir das Mic, ich und schick' sie weiter wie Kiezgrößen
Carpe Diem, dein Hype bleibt leider nur für 'ne Zeit wie Mietmöbel
Wofür gebt ihr euch Mühe, ha? Ihr wollt rauskommen? Geht vor die Tür
Das is' mein Warmlaufen, nich' ma' die Kür
Fick nich' mit mir, halt die Füße still
Nach dem Verse bist du Fix und Foxi wie Kinderlektüre
Ich brauch' dich nur mit ei'm Finger berühren, du wirst zum Fels

Ich klang mit 14 noch so als wär' ich 9 Jahre alt
So als wär' ich noch'n Kind und die meisten war'n im Stimmbruch
Ich hingegen war auf der Sinnsuche, warum?
Ich knallte Mädels, aber klang wie'n Mädel
Ganz im Ernst, wollt 'ne Stimme wie die ander'n, die dich älter wirken lässt
Die Ollen fanden das süß ich fand's übertrieben nervig
Lehrer schickten mich wegen ihr zu diversen Lesewettbewerben
Sie meinten
""Guck, du sprichst wie ein Engel!""
Ich dachte mir, die wolln' mich alle verarschen, macht das mal selber
Hab' geglaubt, das wär' Blamage, so 'ne Stimme zu haben
Nichtsahnend, was noch alles auf mich wartete, ich bekam
Das erste Album der Beasties und war geschockt wegen Ad-Rock
Dann entdeckte ich Eazy, mein Leben machte 'ne Kehrtwendung

Wollte klingen wie A-Plus und Opio von den Souls (Damn)
Fing auf Deutsch an, plötzlich stand die Welt Kopf, Labels klopften
Bei mir die Tür mit ihren Geldkoffern
Clubs wollten Bookings, Rapper wollten Features
Auf einmal zahlt mir die früher verhasste Stimme die Miete
Mein Visum zu den Herzen, Ticket in den Walkman
Die Klangfarbe, die sich mit einmal spitten ins Ohr brennt
Eine unter tausend, dieser Segen hier is' Gold wert
Fans kriegen Gänsehaut Live aufm' Konzert
Andere pitchen ihre Stimmen runter, wollen härter kling'
Meine Bestimmung zu akzeptieren war anfangs schwer für mich
Ich dachte, das wär' 'ne Schwäche, die mich bremst

Ich saß Zuhaus', der Drum-computer auf dem Schoß
Als mein Vater schrie „Mach was für die Schule du Idiot!“
Ich hab sie mies verkackt, sorry Baba doch ich war zu abgelenkt
Allein mit einem Mikrofon in meiner Rap-Gedankenwelt
Ich hing mit MC8 klärte ollen mit Shore
Die Spinner wollten zum Sport-
Platz ich wollt nur auf die Bühne
Die andern saßen im Hof 'rum, ich war texten im Proberaum
S der Gheddophilosoph, Flow blendend wie Koma-saufen
Wenn ich komm ist es aus, sag „Adios“ zu der Karriere
Keine Niederlage, mich bekriegen kostet deine Ehre
Und ich schreib es in mein Fleisch
Hip-Hop is my life
Steh mit 50 auf'm Splash, dreh am Teller wie auf Teiln'
Mach 'n uprock, downrock, bodyrock, mit Scotty und Falk
Ihr Kackvögel steckt den Kopf in den Sand
Auf eure Namen gibt es Finderlohn
Heut' bin ich zwar am Start
Doch leider war es nicht immer so, in dem Land hier gab es

Keine Beats
Keine Rhymes
Keine Texte, die du liebst oder feierst
Keine Durchdreh-Mucke, keine Tracks die dich fesseln
Nichtmal ein' echten Rapper, und dann kam Essah!
Und dann kam Essah!
Und dann kam Essah!

Boby gab mir den Style, Onur die Lifepower
Mel' stärkte mir den Rücken
Steinmauer
Feuer Frei, Der King ist hier
Grund für den Umschwung
Rapper tauchen unter, ich bleib in aller Munde wie Zungen
Und was für Ranglisten?
Guck ihr könnt mich nicht mehr einstufen
Wenn ich bock hab rap' ich ab jetzt rückwärts, Zeitlupe
Vorband Zum Haupptakt, Talent zur Legende
Vom Fan zum Dirigenten, ich bin lang' noch nicht zu Ende
Krieg den Schädel wieder klar,
Plane gut wo du stehst Opfer
Mich zu haten, das ist so wagemutig wie Weight-Watchers
Und ich schlage g'rade mal Drakes Kopf ab
Nur sinnblidlich, sie hör'n das und rufen OMG wie Waynes Tochter
Guck' ich geb Stoff, hab keine Bremsen verbaut
Deswegen start' ich und lass es einfach mal laufen,
Bis die Reifen erschöpft sind
Lyrische Inception, ihr bekommt mich nicht mehr weg
Ich bin verankert in den Köpfen
Vor mir gab's in diesem Land hier

Keine Texte, die du liebst oder feierst
Keine Durchdreh-Mucke, keine Tracks die dich fesseln

Zieht die Jacken an

Dieser Sound hier, mein Erbe für meine Jungs
Linke Spur im 'nem Turbo
Trotzdem sterb' ich für die Kunst und ich schwör's auf 'ne Belton
Keiner kann dir helfen
Denn ich komm' und unterwerfe deine Stadt wie Krieg der Welten
So als hätt ich den Verstand verlorn',

Kool Savas,"Als du vier Jahre alt warst, besuchte ich euch in Istanbul
Mit deinen Eltern holtest du mich am Flughafen ab
Wir hatten uns zwei Jahre nicht gesehen
An den nächsten Tagen war ich vormittags mit dir allein
Deine Eltern waren zur Arbeit gegangen
Wir wollten spielen
Dazu legtest du dann die Stühle auf den Boden, das war ein Schiff
Wir setzten uns rein und fuhren über den Ozean
Plötzlich riefst du „Achtung, köpekbalığı kommt!“
Dann riefst du „Er hat mich gebissen, Blut kommt raus!“
Allmählich wurde mir klar, köpekbalığı, das sollte ein Haifisch sein
Nun wollte ich auch einige andere Wörter auf Türkisch lernen
Und fragte dich „Was heißt Brot?“
Du sagtest „kuş“
Ich fragte dich „Was heißt Vogel?“
Du sagtest „ekmek“
Und so fragte ich noch einige andere Wörter
Als deine Eltern nach Haus kamen
Und ich voller Stolz sagte, was ich alles gelernt hatte an nur einem Morgen
Gab es Kopfschütteln und Gelächter
Am meisten gelacht hast du, Savas, denn du hattest ja alle Wörter vertauscht",Anekdote aus Istanbul Skit,2014

Dein Highlight ist Thailand denn du Made findest Knaben so niedlich
Frag nicht nach Features, wag es dich niemals
Ich dring in dein Anus lyrisch mit den Parts wie 'n Dietrich
Bei mir läuft nicht, es stapelt und biegt sich
Bei dir läufts nur aus den Nebenhöhlen starke Sinusitis
Und glaub mir ich flow wahnsinnig quasi als ob man grade verliebt ist
Monarch, dessen Thronfolger gab's oder gibt's nicht
Die Lage ist kritisch, ihr Eunuchen scheut Duschen
Stinkt schlimm zum Himmel, die Nase verzieht sich
Was für Sagen und Mythen, ich feuer' heute auf euch Toys

Sind enttäuscht, denn ihre Zeit läuft rasend wie Hasen und Beagle
Guck, nur 'ne kurze Phase, das war's du Hund
Der Grund deines Sturzes war deine unsympathische Art gepaart

Strunzdumm starten sie Kriege
Die sie nie mehr beenden, werden

Ihr Geist verstrahlt und besessen, ich weiß
Wessen Bücher ihr lest und welcher Regel ihr Folge leistet
Kein Int'resse an 'nem Pakt mit diesem Pack

Die Offerte 'n Becher Blut für'n Platz an der Spitze
Wie könnt' ich so was jemals unterschreiben?
Lass mal die Witze, wirklich jetzt, rede nicht mit mir
Was denkst du, wer ich bin, du Flasche?
Lieber brenn' ich zu Asche, bevor ich das unterstütze
Trau' keiner Schlange, fick eure 48 Gesetze

Sie wollen mich umpolen, Hirn waschen
Nennen ihre Männer Lemminge, da sie sich grundlos führ'n lassen

Diese Drecksäcke boxen nur Schwächere
Erzähl'n ich würde sterben an Krebs
Doch besser für dich, wenn es nicht so ist
Sonst kämst du auf jeden mit würd' ich geh'n
Probier' die Fakten zu dreh'n, mein Shit ist die Wahrheit
Ich wär' mehr Mann, als ihr, mit 'nem Kilt und Armreif
Zerbrech' dich wie'n Sparschwein, tu nur, als wärst du fromm
Aber Luzifer ist dein Gott und du willst ihm nah' sein

Rotz' auf die Erde und es wächst 'n Wahrzeichen

? Lauf' wie ?, keine Bars, nur Images, Mann
Stellt sie zur Rede, sie blocken ab und passen ?

Kool Savas,"Ich sprech' mit dem Stift
Und du gehst von dannen als ob dich Winzling 'nen Sturm trifft
Weg aus dem Irrenhaus, ihr seid für die Inspiration Gift
Schalt den Lap aus, ich jage euern Zirkus in die Luft
Keine Zweifel und Schwachstellen, bei mir wirkt nicht dieser Stuss
Ich bin das Ganze, das gesamte Paket
Von der Stage zum Train im Moonwalk
Pause, Ich zeig dir Schwanz, wo du stehst
Guck, ihr rappt euch um Kopf und Kragen
Jedes Wort ist so destruktiv
Poste mein' Standort im Wolkenatlas statt Facebook
Zieh 'ne Karte, warte, ich prophezeih' dir die Zukunft
Am Ende entpuppt sich dein komplettes Leben als Trugschluss
Jede Entscheidung falsch, jede Zeile verschwendet
Nur leeres Gesülze, keine Courage, sich zu verändern
Du bist Darsteller, jemand der 'nen Rapper imitiert
Nicht mehr nur gefickt, sie haben diese Mucke infiziert
Blick auf's Karma-Konto, sammel gute Taten
Bring sie alle um, lieber jetzt als gleich
Ihr habt lang genug gewartet

Asche zu Asche, Staub zu Staub
Wenn du es ihnen nicht glaubst, komm und schau
Wie ich alle Hunde begrabe, deine
Träume gehen in Rauch auf, ich brauch keine Krümel
Rap ist mein, ich will den ganzen Kuchen haben
Ihr habt (lang genug gewartet)
Ihr habt (lang genug gewartet)
Ihr habt (lang genug gewartet, dass ein Album erscheint)
Denn ihr habt (lang genug gewartet)
Ihr habt (lang genug gewartet)

Scheint als wärt ihr von der Erde völlig losgelöst wie Major Tom
Habt den Sektor verlassen, aus dem man irgendwann wiederkommt
Keine Sonderrechte, Knecht, es endet wie gehabt
Denn 99 von 100 Rappern enden leider wieder als Hartzer
Ich weiß, trauriger Fakt
Mach ruhig Auge, glaub ich verkack
Aber es ist Raps Schweizer Uhrwerk
Ihr kriegt mich kaum aus dem Takt
Ich bring den Raum zum illuminieren bis diese Parasiten erblinden
Wir sind uns fremd, teilen nicht die gleiche Gesinnung
Als wollten sie mir was Gutes und hätten mich grad entdeckt
Wie, dich Fotze featuren? Wofür hab ich zwanzig Jahre gerappt?
Und ich bin lieber in 'nem Sarg als auf 'nem Track mit dir
Nenn' es „Interview mit 'nem Vampir“
Weil du in meiner Welt nicht existierst
Deine Diskografie, das Manifest der Verzweiflung
Sieh, ich spalt' deinen Schädel zu dem Beat hier und tauf es Eisprung
Keine Skrupel, lass sie bluten und zermalme den Feind
Ich versprech' es, ihr müsst nur warten, bis mein Album erscheint

Asche zu Asche, Staub zu Staub
Wenn du es ihnen nicht glaubst, komm und schau
Wie ich alle Hunde begrabe
Deine Träume gehen in Rauch auf, ich brauch keine Krümel
Rap ist mein, ich will den ganzen Kuchen haben
Ihr habt (lang genug gewartet)

Wollen an die Spitze, aber landen auf dem Strich
Schlucken Wichse, haben 'ne Latte im Gesicht
Und dabei sagen sie „Ich mache nur mein Ding!“ Ah
Ihr macht einen Scheiß, gestern Rap
Heute Trap, übermorgen Rock
Schizophren, als würd' ein kleiner Mann in ihren Ohren hocken
Ihr seid das beste, was mir je passiert ist
Wirklich, ich muss euch danken, denn ihr inspiriert mich
Hab' euch mein Herz ausgeschüttet auf GP
Und jetzt benutz' ich wieder deutsche Rapper als WC
Sie wollen nach oben, aber stecken im EG
Diese Lügenbarone, ich durchschau' sie wie 'n CT
Der Beat ist ein trojanisches Pferd
Die Melodie so süß wie Zuckerwatte
Ich zerstör' dich, ohne zu erwähnen dass ich 'ne Mutter hacke

Ich stepp' ans Mic und zerstöre jeden Rapper wie Gammastrahlen
Twilight, Blutsauger, Wesen ohne Skrupel
Für ein kleines bisschen Dubel (Was?) kneten sie die Nudel
Das ist Deutschrap, Inzest, Fritzl-Programm
Ein mal kurz die Nase geschnäubt, du hast dein' Grips in der Hand
Es bleibt das Bargeld aus und sie landen in der Klapse
Ich bin Staatsheld, auch ohne Landung auf dem Hudson
Statt zu handeln wollen sie quatschen
Darwin dreht sich grade im Grab um
Der Arme denkt sich, was 'ne Schande für die Affen
Verwandel sie mit 'ner Zeile zu Feinstaub
Erst Welle im Video, danach kleinlaut heimbrausen im DriveNow
Tausende Scheißhaufen als Rapper verkleidet
Komm und hol sie alle
Ihr erlebt mich am Mikrofon nur im Rocky-Modus
Vom Proberaum bis zur Spitze der Charts

Ich mach' meine Mucke anders, schreibe, spucke Anthrax
Deutsche Rapper, du kannst sie in Reisebussen ankarr'n
Stricher erbleichen, ich dropp' Bomben wie FunkFlex
Du bist nicht mehr der gleiche, als ob dein Onkel dich anfässt
Familiendrama, du bist das Ergebnis, wenn mal Präser platzen
Was für „läuft“, ich bitte euch, bei ihm nennt man das Käfer kraxeln
Morgens in die Jordans, abends grüß die Käseplatte
Ekelhaft, die Zähne sehen so aus, als ob sie Lepra hatten
Sperr' dich in 'ne Legebatterie, gib deine Eier ab, Shit
Deine Karriere war kürzer als die eines Babystramplers
Begrabe Spinner, lass sie lauschen, wie die Gräser wachsen
Mit 'ner Stimme so atemberaubend wie 'n Leberhaken
Federführend in jeder Sparte, breit gefächertes Sortiment wie Krämerladen
Ich spitte präziser als 'ne Laserwaffe
Rapper leben Peter-Zwegat-Hustle
Statt die Arme, könnt Ihr jetzt trainieren
Wie man den ganzen Tag lang mit 'nem Bagel satt ist

Ah, sie sagen, bring' dich mal um
Töte dich, tu's für uns, tu's für die Kunst
Tu' alles, was nötig ist, mach 'n Punkt
Zöger' nicht, gib dem Ding nur 'n Grund
Nimm dir dein Leben, werd' ein (Märtyrer!)
Nimm dir dein Leben, werd' ein (Märtyrer!)
Nimm dir dein Leben, werd' ein (Märtyrer!)
Nimm dir dein Leben, werd' ein (Märtyrer!)

Sag mir, wie kannst du bestehen, wenn du kein' Standpunkt bringst?
Tu auf Tier, das erklärt, warum du dich wie'n Bandwurm windest
Rapper nehmen Schwanz in den Mund (Wann?) Wenn der Ansturm stimmt
Wenn die Aussicht auf Anerkennung winkt, meine Ankunft klingt
Als würden Düsenjäger eben auf 'nem Flugzeugträger landen
Wenn ich Reden halte, kriegen sie größere Ohren als Elefanten
Nenn' dich den Illusionist, denn deine als die Fee erwähnte Schlampe
Entpuppt sich näher betrachtet als 'ne Megabratze
Ich will dich killen und den Boden mit dem Gewebe pflastern
Endgegner, Feinde zerfallen, als ob sie Corega-Tabs sind
Masken sind vorbei, jetzt kommt Lederstrappse
Ich will nicht mal jeden hassen, doch sie liefern Gründe wie per-Meter-Ware
Ich muss 'n Liter Kleber atmen, um zu sein wie sie
Scheiß MCs, pflanz sie in Reih und Glied wie im Schrebergarten
Ich bin spendabel, aber auf Rap bezogen Egomane
Sie schreien „Essah, leben und leben lassen!“ Ich glaube nicht

Ah, sie sagen, bring' dich mal um
Töte dich, tu's für uns, tu's für die Kunst
Tu' alles, was nötig ist, mach 'n Punkt
Zöger' nicht, gib dem Ding nur 'n Grund

Spitten auf höchstem Niveau und trotzdem sind's alles Hits

Somit machst du dich vom Clown zu 'nem Sklaven egal
wie lang auch dein Schwanz ist
Der Einzige, der gefickt wird, bist du
Fuck, das ist Fakt, keine Sache der Ansicht
Mein Flow todbringend, Kamikaze, infektiös
Mach' auf Sportlehrer, Body-Mass-Index schön
Er ist Fake, Laminat, Ausweichprodukt
Ackern für Mindestlöhne, macht nicht mehr Wind als Föhne
Ich bin der Hammer-tor-nado, Herz kälter als Fargo
Schieß' ohne Vorwarnung wahllos, mein Wort ist Gesetz
Ich sprech's und es kommt zum Tragen wie Ford Cargos
Reservier' dir bei Marsano 'n festliches Gesteck
Für den bestmöglichen Fall, dass du verreckst
Werf's dir zu, in den Sarkophag
So, mit dir bin ich fertig, jetzt next
Diese MCs flüchten ins Exil, wenn ich rapp'
Sind Jünger, doch sehen neben mir alt aus
Wenn du meinst, das wächst dir über den Kopf, heul' dich bei Udo Walz aus
Gerafft? Das hier nennt man Mucke Slash Wissenschaft
Die Quintessenz ist S, gib' mir den Beat
Ich blüh' auf, wie nach dem Winterende
Pfennigfuchser, sie würden töten für Klimpergeld
Reiben Sack und vergreifen sich
Nur an Schwachen wie Kinderschänder
Lade nach, feuer' auf euch Stümper ständig unverändert
Jahrelang schon rücksichtlos als hätt' ich 'nen Job als blinder Henker
Bring's zu Ende, schick' sie zu den Engeln

Willkommen in der echten Welt

Wo man erkennt, dass dein ganzes Leben 'ne Lüge ist
Wo dich keiner deiner Soldaten beschützt und hütet

Richtig, dein Kommentar, behalt's im Hals
Du willst mein Wissen? Check' den Informationsgehalt im Salz
Wenn ich schwitze, streckst du die Arme wie
Dhalsim und willst ein bisschen ab, sie nenn' mich Spielverderber
Wie'n Feuerspucker bei Kissenschlachten
Wichser, mach mal nicht auf wild und wacker, du Spacken
Hast nur ne Macke aufgrund der verkackten Haptik deiner Gattin
Schau' Clown, deine Zeit ist um, Schall und Rauch, rapp' nie mehr
Jeder kriegt die Galle, wenn du auftauchst wie der MacKeeper
Bei mir um ein Feature betteln du Dilettant
In dem Moment überschreitest du 'ne Grenze wie'n Immigrant
Ich muss dich warnen, Affe
Dieser Mumpitz-Stumpfsinns-Flow
auf einem Track mit mir, deine Karriere endet in Mahnwachen
Ungewöhnlich, plötzlich zittern Spitter vor Furcht
Mach's wie Uli Hoeneß, fütter diese Ficker mit Wurst
Und das Schönste ist, sie betiteln ihre Mütter als Huren
Und sind plötzlich wieder als Brüder auf Tour
Das ist absurd, Men in Black, Erinnerung weg
Richte den Kurs kurz, nix straight
Dein Leben geht direkt um die Kurve
Fronten um jeden Preis, Welle geschmackloser als Gurken
Null Wachstum, diese Rapper stagnieren und schlagen Wurzeln
Ich bin fresh wie nach der Geburt
Mich biten widerstrebt jeglichem Sinn
Denn meine Worte sind krebserregend wie Shrimps
Erinner' dich, ich bin nicht nur der King dieser Mucke (was sonst?)

Spar's dir für Wendy, erzähl' mir nix vom Pferd
Ich fühl' mich grad wie der Crocodile Hunter, merke den Stich im Herz
Scherzartikel-MCs - Rote Nase, lachender Mund auf der Suche nach Krümeln
Wie Ungeziefer, sie krabbeln herum
Lass sie machen, die Hunde stehen Spalier, links
Und rechts den Schwanz in der Hand
Aber wen wollt ihr ficken? Des ist 'ne Sackgasse
Kryptischer Flow und ihr meint es zu entschlüsseln
Dazu müsstet ihr erst mal jeden möglichen Code besitzen, wie Abwasser
Meine Bars ein lyrisches Massaker
Las auf YouTube als Propaganda
Essah bricht die Rekorde wie „Oppa Gangnam“
Und keine Vergleiche, Opfer, das sind Statements
Du verziehst die Fresse als ob Rocky grade „Adrian!“ ruft
Beweg' Rapper zum Suizid, nenn' es Club der toten Dichter

Lehnen sich weiter aus dem Fenster, als Vanilleeis
Zerstör' sie, hinterlasse nur Trümmerteile
Radiere den Virus aus, ansonsten wird er immer dreister
Nenn mich H-I-P H-O-P Sanitizer
Begieß sie mit Napalm
Sie labern, schmücken sich mit fremden Federn wie Indianer
Bitte glaub mir tauf' deine liebste Dampfer
Nicht weil das Schwein so fett ist wie Sau
Ne sie läuft aus den Armen 'n triefenden Hahn
Hat miefige Haare, mieser Zahnbelag
Seite an Seite zieht ihr in den Krieg der Feinde
Nietet sie easy um mit ihrem Atem
Elite-Marder, ein Stück Schmutz
Und dennoch krass und über die fremde Spezies
Ich kann mit diesen MCs nicht interagieren
Und jetzt wird klar, wer ist das Schaf und wer der Wolf
Ich fress' ihn auf, erzählt von Bentleys
Aber der Lügenbold hat 'nen Golf, was soll's
Andere Art, andere Werte
Deswegen kill' ich sie alle, bevor ich mir die Namen merke

Geh' auf die Venus, ich will sehen wie die deutschen MCs performen
Sie ficken sich gegenseitig vor aller Augen in Ordnung
Ein Haufen aus Fleischpenisse
Korpus nicht erklärbar mit Worten
Dinge, die du nie mehr vergisst wie 'n ewiger Ohrwurm
Vor zwei Jahrzehnten geboren und du willst meine Kunst bewerten?
Ich ramm' dein' Rumpf stumpf in die Erde, sag mir, wie wär das?
Sie schlafen ein, aber ich auf kein'
Ratter' durch den Takt, wie 'ne Nähmaschine
Wer von uns siegt, liegt auf der Hand wie 'ne Lebenslinie
Eine Zeile, er macht 'nen schnelleren Abgang als Schneelawinen
Ich push' diese Mucke, ihr fickt sie, ob das ein fairer Deal ist
Niemals, deswegen geh' ich weiter bis sie in Gräbern liegen
Nur wenn es dann für den Letzten vorbei ist, erlang ich Seelenfrieden
Lass sie kommen, sie bekommen ihren Gnadenstoß, ich frage bloß
Wozu erwähnen, für mich sind sie namenlos

Du laberst und laberst von Werten, die du nicht besitzt alles Palaver
Vollgekokst nach deinem Puffbesuch spielst du Automaten, aber redest von Ramadan
Du frisst dich voll, dein Umfeld ist parallel unterernährt
Du änderst den Ton, um dich männlich zu fühlen, aber weißt du, du brichst deiner Mutter das Herz?
Du machst es dir einfach, denn du willst, dass Flous regnet, aber
Was du da tust, Mädchen, ist verdammt nochmal rufschädigend
Es trifft deinen Impuls, wenn sie sagen „Du bist eine Null!“
Der Erfolg ist dein, aber bei Niederlagen bist du dir zu schade und das Schicksal ist schuld
Heh, du hast kein bisschen Geduld, triffst Entscheidungen voreilig
Versinkst im Gras, so wie Kornkreise und deine Lungenflügel sind Schornsteine
Du hast nix zurückgelegt, nix gepackt und nix Greifbares zum Vorzeigen
Das Leben ist hart und frisst Menschen wie dich als Vorspeise, mein Freund

Es gibt da einen, der dir vorauseilt, und das ist dein Ruf (das ist dein Ruf)
Du bist nur so wie du dich gibst, du bist das, was du sagst und was du tust (sagst und was du tust)

Guck mal in den Spiegel was macht die denn da?
Lügen haben kurze Beine und können keine Miete zahlen

Niemand auf diesem Planeten kann für mich bestimmen, was ich denken darf oder nicht
Ich war zu schüchtern, um den Mund zu öffnen, drum lächelt’ ich jedem nur brav ins Gesicht
Kam mit zwölf nach Berlin, wo sie meinten „Entscheide dich!
Kartoffel oder Kanake?“ Doch wie, wenn man beides ist?
Hing mit den intolerantesten Mistvögeln aller Zeiten, aber lernte von ihnen dann einiges
Nie sein wie sie, gib nicht die Kontrolle ab
Mach mich zum Opfer, wenn ich zulass’, dass so ein Opfer wie du mich zum Opfer macht
Such dir ’nen Roboter, ich hab’ ’n Kofferdamm
Was für ’ne „Ehre“? Was für „Moral“? Wer von euch Missgeburten darf Gott spielen?
Mir ist es egal, ob du rumfickst, Ollen oder Jungs fickst, Speed ballerst oder an der Bong ziehst, friss Schwanz
Der Tod ist zu nah, um zu warten, dass mir irgendjemand sagt, was ich kann oder nicht kann
Glauben muss, machen muss, wählen muss, sagen muss
Dicker, ich muss nur beim Pissdrang, keine Erklärung
Ich wollt’ es und hab’ es geschafft oder wollt’ es und ging dabei drauf
Niemand auf diesem Planeten kann für mich bestimmen, was ich denken darf, ganz gleich, was sie behaupten

Was juckt es dich, wo ich mich aufhalt’, mit wem ich was tu’? (Mit wem ich was tu’?)
Ich änder’ nichts, bleibe so wie ich bin die andern haben’s schon versucht (Haben’s schon versucht)

Scheiß drauf, ob sie sagen, „Was macht die denn da?“!

Mentales Powertraining, dein verdammtes Auge gibt mir Kraft
Babaanne wusst' es, sprach täglich ein Gebet für mich
Das Ergebnis ihr Enkel wurd' zum wichtigsten deutschen Rapper, der lebt
Guck, ich hab' alles investiert, geackert und wie blöd geschwitzt
Dennoch probierst du, mich zu sabotieren mit dem bösen Blick
Leute zweifeln an „Auge“, bis es sie trifft
Werden verrückt oder verlieren alles, manche wollen nicht ma', dass man drüber spricht
Mein Vater bat mich nur „Protz nicht rum mit dem Geld, das du verdienst!“
Auch wenn er nicht dran glaubt, weiß er genau, das Auge ist aktiv
Ich bin vorsichtig und pass' auf
Selbst die Menschen, die du kennst, sind manchmal missgünstig

Wenn du sagst, es steht schon geschrieben, was mit uns sein soll und passiert
Denn im Alleingang hob ich Deutschrap aus der Taufe hier
Anstelle laut zu applaudieren, ist ihr Dank dafür, sie machen Auge
Konzentrieren sich nur auf mich statt auf sich selbst zu schauen
Im Glauben dran, ihr Leben könnt' sich irgendwie verbessern, wenn sie mir meins versauen
Lächeln mich an, meint ihr echt, ich bin so dämlich!?
Ich weiß doch, würd' ich auf einmal das Zeitliche segnen, wärt ihr begeistert
Die Antwort, wieso ich so gut wie nie im Fernsehen bin
Hype bringt neidvolles Auge, was selbst deine Liebsten gefährden könnte
Und irgendwer ist angepisst, sieht dich verantwortlich
Für sein Scheitern, Streit und Angriffe sind der Preis für das Rampenlicht
Behaupten „du bist der Beste, mein Bruder!“, doch hinterm Rücken
Mustern sie unbemerkt deine Frau mit lüsternen Blicken
Nennen dich Bastard und Schlimmeres
Denn sie lieben's, zu erklären, warum sie losen, doch hassen den Gewinner, die Wichser

Heute wollen sie mir ein Kind andrehen
Seh' mein Gesicht ab heute auf jeder Litfaßsäule
Erfüll' mir grade meine Kindheitsträume

Chartrider werden eingesperrt wie in Malaysia

Bars meißel ich wie ein maßschneidender Arbeiter
Während ihr den Haarspaltern aus der USA weiter

Mit acht gedacht, ich wär'n Superheld, könnt' Baba retten
Hörte einmal seine Stimme, doch die Worte blieben stecken
Mit neun bekam ich in die Fresse, hab mich nicht gewehrt
Denn mir fehlte der Vater, der mir erklärte seinen Mann zu stehen
'Ne Irre wollte mich mit zehn entführen, zerrte mich in die Tür
Ich riss mich los, rannte, als wär' der Teufel hinter mir her
Mit elf sah ich meinen Vater wieder, doch
Wieder wurd' alles auf den Kopf gestellt und ich wurd' zu 'nem Berliner

Als wäre jeder von euch gegen mich, ständig unter Druck
Hab im Alltag geschwiegen, bin am Mikrofon geplatzt
Ein Junge rächt sich an der Welt, getrieben von dem Hass
Mit 'ner Hand voller Pech, 'nem Kopf voller Zweifel

Ficker chill', nicht Bill Cosby aber ich gebe Stoff
Du Esel opferst alles für Anerkennung, nimmst jede Chance
Er wittert Fame und kriegt'n Tunneblick wie wenn ein Mädel shoppt
Taui auf den Tisch und die Ehre hopst aus dem zehnten Stock
Du redest stolz und bläst bei 'nem Lady Boy bis der Penis tropft
Wie 'n Käsecroque der Megatron, S - Stimme wie 'n Nebelhorn
Die die Nacht durchbricht wie jemand der über'n Pegel soff

Lass sie glauben (ich bin fertig)
Nie, ich hab' gerade erst begonnen
Bring's zu Ende und starte wieder von vorne
Sie zweifeln an meinen (Fertig)-Keiten Ziel' und entfern' sie gekonnt
Kugeln fliegen, Köpfe platzen wie Bomben
Und (ich bin fertig)
Sie blicken auf jeden Schritt hier mit Argwohn (fertig)
Ihre Nerven blank liegend unter Starkstrom (fertig)
Zähneknirschend ohne Wirkung gefahrlos
Ihr könnt mein Vermächtnis nicht mehr beschmutzen (ich bin fertig)

Schwarz-weißes Camouflage gut getarnt wie'n Erlkönig
Schwebend auf 'nem Hoverboard ehrwürdig wie'n Berglöwe
Rapper sind wie Toxavit nervtötend, ich will alles zerstören
Was für sie von Bedeutung ist als ob es um Erdöl geht
Film ihren Todeskampf für den nächsten Teil von Sinister
Keine Gimmicks, der Flow echt Killer wie Mac Minister dein
Profilbild Raubkatze, doch chillen mit Kojoten
Fick mit mir du wirst mich nicht mehr los wie Sylvie den Piloten
Deutscher Rap, jede Silbe ist gelogen darum spitt' ich giftig
Wie auf Kohle grillen in der Wohnung wilder als 'n Mogli
Seh' MCs als blinde Antilopen, gefundenes Fressen
S mit dem Willen des Todes nur noch gewinnen für die Quote
Hundert Klicks und du Wichser bist am Springen wie'n Kobold
Guck' Rap ist drunter und drüber, ich entwirre diesen Knoten
Die Ikone, jede Strophe könnt ihr sniffen wie 'ne Droge
Stimme Aphrodisiakum Ollen fingern sich die Dose
Was für Player, du musst dringend wieder hobeln, bei dir kribbelt's in den Hoden
Schimmelt's in der Hose, wimmelt's vor Mikroben
Irres Biotop, sie hören das dämlich grinsend wie Emojis
Gehen nach Hause und verbinden ihrer Ohren 
Dimmen jedes Zimmer in der Wohnung 
Mich ficken? Wie bitte? Bevor ich verlier'
Schneid' ich ihn ab und werf' vor dir meinen Pimmel auf den Boden
Rapper editiern und trimmen ihre Vocals 
In der Hoffnung sie kommen an mich ran, nie, ich bleib' wie der Himmel immer oben

Lass sie glauben (ich bin fertig)
Nie, ich hab' gerade erst begonnen

Rap aus Paris hat dein Bewusstsein nicht geschwächt, sondern radiert
Mein Hass ist relativ monströs, drei Menschen sterben dran zu viert
Ihr sagt Deutschland sei nur noch nicht ready wenn's nicht läuft
Dabei ist ""bei Scheiße mitzieh'n"" eigentlich doch typisch deutsch
Absolut kein Plan wieso dein Produzent Frequenzen nutzt
Die außer Schmutz wie dir, nur ein Hund hören kann
Hip Hop heißt bei deinen Spasten ""wir haben nichts zu tun""
Und Internet - immer das selbe - Pattern nennt ihr deutschen Trap
Und dass all die Frauen in euren Videos Sturmmasken tragen
Kann ja selbst den dümmsten Menschen doch nur mutmaßen lassen
Dass ihr Trottel euch für sie schämt, oder sie sich für euch
Oder es ist jedes mal die selbe Nicole
Um deine Gang zu beschreiben, braucht es nicht einmal zwei Sätze
Eine Jeansweste kombiniert mit konzentrierter Wackness
Ihr denkt, ich hass' alle, sagen kann ich auch
Ich rapp' nicht aus Liebe, sondern weil mich Essahdamus braucht

Dein Gefronte hilft dir nur die Wahrheit nicht zu peilen
Stepp' ans Mic, ich töte deine Weltsicht mit nur einer Zeile
Leiste mehr für Rap mit nur einem Verse als du mit 16 Alben
Doch komm' nächstes Leben wieder um direkt auf ihn zu scheißen
2016 Deutschland bitet immer noch Ami-Müll aus Angst
Und macht dankbar Hype um jeden der im Grunde gar nichts kann
Du musst tagelang Google nach Erklärungen durchsuchen
Doch verstehst nicht einen Satz, hörst du den Soundtrack meiner Jugend
Ich bin cool und lebe meinen Traum wie Marcus Staiger
Sitz' im Bunker und hör mir den ganzen Tag lang euren Scheiß an
Denn Rap zieht mit sich, dass du irgendwann allein' bist
Und dass jeder Mensch der findet dass du besser rappst, dich bitet
Fans der ersten Stunde hassen uns jetzt, doch kaufen auch Alben von

Keine Skrupel, er würde jeden Schwanz für 'n Hunni blown

Schädel werden kontrolliert gesprengt, wie das World Trade
Ich denke nicht, ich burn jeden, ich burn jeden, mach nicht auf King
Denn neben mir hast du Ficker nur dumm zu grinsen, wie die First Lady
SAV der Sensei, ich spritz ab wie Chemtrails
Du hörst nur, dass ich komm und schreist Mayday, wie Sven Väth
Keiner entgeht dem Endgegner, massig Klicks und Wahnsinnspromo

Ohne Gnade lassen sie sich abends im Akkord nageln

Ob gestern, morgen oder heute MCs bleiben beute
Ich häute euch nach wie vor mit überschäumender Freude
Wir läuteten kein Zeitalter ein, sondern bedeuten
Die Unterscheidung von etwas und nichts, Weizen und Spreu sind
Begriffe, die erst sehr viel später auftauchen
Die nur Bitches wie du gebrauchen, um den Rauch der eignen Gefühle zu straucheln
Oder eher zu taumeln, nur um dann nach Pi mal Daumen eine Minute von der nächsten Eichel zu baumeln
Euch erreichen die Formeln kaum mehr als Offshore-Wellen
Küstenstreifen in Bordellen, schweifen die Gedanken am schnellsten

Akribisches vorgehen, Ordnen der Worten nach meiner Formel
Unstoppbar wie ne Frau die kurz vorm Partus abermals entschieden presst
Ihr braucht nicht nur Beat, die brennen und ne Prise S'
Sondern besser den direkten Draht zu ihm
Damit er noch schnell ändert, was schon geschrieben ist

I won't surrender 
And nothing that you do can bring me down
I carry the crown, make 'em bow
Will not surrender 
And nothing that you say can stop me now
No I won't, no I won't, no I won't
Won't, won't back down

There's moments where I stood up
And said you're not going to bully me
Because my mother made me believe in myself
No matter how many people tell me
Stop believing in yourself! 
Stop affirming what you're gonna do' and then
And then completing that in real life
That's the improper way to do it
I refuse to follow those rules
The society has setup in the way that they control people

Ah!
Saß im Zug mit meiner Mutter und paar Playmos in der Hand
Wusste, höchstwahrscheinlich kehr' ich nie zurück in dieses Land
Denn sie nahmen mir den Vater weg
Ich bekam 'ne neue Rolle zugeteilt und war der Mann im Haus jetzt grade ma' mit sechs
Konnte nicht verstehen, was Phase ist Mutter erklärte
„Wir wollen was ändern und das ist der Preis, den wir dafür zahlen müssen!“
Ich erzähl' das nicht, um Mitleid zu erregen (eh-eh)
Sondern damit ihr versteht, was Rap für 'n Wert hat in mei'm Leben
Nix mit Hobby, Dicker, Thema ist nicht lesen oder stricken
Ich nehm' das Mic im Bestreben, ihre Seelen zu zerpflücken
Sie probierten, mich zu opfern in der Hoffnung, dass mein Wille bricht
Solange bis die einzige Option nur noch gewinnen ist
Sagten mein' Untergang voraus und haben mich kleingeredet
Leider sind bis heut ihre Erwartung' nicht eingetreten
Nicht möglich doch, ich zog mich selber aus dem Sumpf

Ich komm' aus Ostberlin eine düstere Stadt
Doch als ich acht war, haben wir nachts rübergemacht
Vom Regen in die Traufe, verbrachte wenig Zeit zuhause
Doch Mama, guck, ich hab' es auf die Bühne geschafft!
Ich mein', direkt vor meine Füße haben sie Steine gelegt
Doch ich geh' weiter mein' Weg, solang die Scheibe sich dreht
Weil ich weiß, wie's geht ich red' mir den Scheiß von der Seele
Und heute ernt' ich die Belohnung für den Schweiß und die Tränen
Du willst den Thron besteigen, doch dafür bist du zu klein
Du hast auch 'ne Vierundvierzig, doch du passt in mein' Schuh nicht rein
Um besonders cool zu sein, googelst du 'n guten Reim
Und du denkst, 'n Kugelschreiber nutzt man nur zum Kugeln schreiben
Heh, ihr Opfer kommt ewig nicht aufn Punkt
Ich bin tagelang am ackern und steh' nicht nur einfach rum
Und ich lass' die Hater reden mit Penis in ihr'm Mund

Ich bin aufgewachsen hier in Frankfurt in 'nem Dschungel aus Beton
Um hier herauszukommen, meinten viele, gibt es kaum 'ne Chance
Doch hab' den Fight dann aufgenommen und weiter aufgenommen
Habe kein' Applaus bekommen, nur eine drauf bekommen, doch stets alles in Kauf genommen
Ich schrieb 'n Haufen Songs und hielt dran fest an meinem Glauben, daran
War 'n harter Weg, auch wenn es viele nicht von außen wahrnahm'
Es war laufend Drama, all die Jahre, die so grau und hart war'n
Bis der Traum dann wahr war, mussten viele Steine aus der Fahrbahn
Gab nie auf und war damit beschäftigt, meinem Ziel zu folgen
Blieb stabil und wollte nicht mehr Krisen, sondern viel Erfolg haben
Sah 'n Deal und konnt' dann endlich alles in die Tat umsetzen
Dank an Moses Pelham, denn er gab mir den Vertrag und setzte
Auf den Jungen aus den dunklen Straßen einer miesen Gegend
Ihr habt Nieselregen, bei uns hagelt es mit Niederschlägen
Bleib MC mit Seele und gebe sie für die Kunst
Bin geboren, um zu scheitern, doch lebe für den Triumph

Sehr passabel, nur ein klein bisschen warm
Ich liquidier' jeden einzelnen deiner Art
Ruf zum Battle, aber keiner kommt als ging es drum in Chicago Streife zu fahren
Das Tourlife ist heikel, ihr verspürt nicht die leiseste Scham
Reitet eifrig den Aal und schlaft abends mit 'nem Steifen im Arsch
Es wird Nacht, die Gase entweichen dem Darm und das nennt man grade sein
Frage, warum greifen hier nicht deine Regeln wie Kraken?
Du Made parkst deinen Wagen vorm Artemis
Wartest das jemand Hardcore Sympathisches dir die Sahne warm in die Haare wichst
Phase ist, siehst du frischen Dick und wirst nahezu magisch angezogen
Stürzt dich drauf wie unterzuckerter Habicht
Das ist Marketing 2.0, aktueller Status, Rapper labern radikal
Doch blasen sich in die höchsten Etagen
Du menschliche Fassung eines Ed-Hardy-Caps
Ich werf 'n gigantischen Monolith auf deinen Schädel bis er quadratisch ist

Ihr solltet unsere Namen und die, dieser Rapper niemals in einem Satz erwähnen
So wie die Worte „Erdogan“ und „Ziege“
Ich mache Butter bei die Fische, scheiß auf Margarine
Wo ist da der Haken wie Karabiner? Es hagelt Hiebe
Ich stehle Rappern das Spotlight, sie steh'n auf Schattenspiele
Träne im Auge, wie Harlekine, wenn ich gerade spitte
Die Nullen wären gern' Einsen, doch sind nur Datendiebe
Steuern aufs Ende zu wie '96 Pac im Beamer
Ihr hängt auf Tour nur mit Affen rum, so wie Justin Bieber

Got the hired hands and the house on the hill

His wife's at home, expecting their third child
He said, ""the perfect life is just a matter of time""
He'd know what he wants if he could make up his mind

L’arme à la main, mais sans qu’tout ça m’alarme
Je flippe quand même du paradoxe
Et puis quand j’en lé-par à Ox
Y’m dit « viens on fait un morceau entre gun et rose »
C’est l’intifada dans les cœurs
Dans les têtes c’est vie d’film
Entre flingues et roses, on est tous victime
De ces sentiments qui s’mêlent
Même posé il y a des contrats qui s’fêlent
Comme une pluie de grêle en été
Fragile comme du cristal
La ligne s’brise aussi vite que j’kique un freestyle.
Comme ce type plein de haine
Tuant sa femme par amour
Plein de regrets, plein de peines
Les yeux mouillés devant le Cour d’Assise
Chacun ses démons, quand l’diable nous fait dé-ban 
A tous la force nous fait défaut
Et c’est chaque fois le même défi
Suivre le bien alors qu’le mal
nous met tous en appétit


Tantôt aigri ou tantôt heureux de vivre
Ca dépend d’la lumière que j’veux bien laisser entrer
Dans c’qui m’sert de cerveau en fait il n’y pas plus trop d’heure de libre
Pour une suite d’idées claires et sensées
C’est rarement blanc ou noir, bien ou mal, flingue ou rose
C’est jamais clair même quand les zin-cou causent

De bain douche, de bain de foule
D’plein d’coup, de plein de fouf
Comme partout besoin de sous.

regarde comme le quartier regorge
d’enfants doués, carrières trouées
parce qu’on mélange vice et vertu
d’où es-tu toi pour douter, noué, 
l’estomac vide, les yeux vitreux
tout est flouté
Malgré ça j’perd pas d’vue que
Les roses ici sont épineuses, laissant plus d’ecchymoses
Qu’un flingue enrayé, grillé parce que dès qu’il ose
Recommencer 
Une fois la gâchette ankylosée, tu sais comment c’est
C’est pour ça qu’j’mets de l’amour dans ma vie
Afin de noyer ma haine
Et si donc aujourd’hui j’décide de broyer ma peine
C’est que c’est bien plus près de

Mais toujours un calibre sous l’oreiller.",Un Flingue et des Roses,2004

J´viens du n ième rang, j´sais plus le combien tième round
Ou combien fuyèrent, ou tiendraient à se rendre
Ne te déplace pas pour le trône ouais
T´es pas le premier vous êtes trop
Gardez la monnaie, rentrez chez vous en tramway

On a gravit les échelons tout en restant underground
À l´école, quand les mômes répètent nos mots, on les gronde
Pas taillé pour ce rôle, je me voyais black à « wall street »
Mon complice ailier à Chelsea, hey yo notre histoire est celle-ci
Les gens comme nous, n´ont que jusqu´à 6, cette vie n´est pas juste
Pour toi les secondes s´allongent, l´arbitre compte jusqu´à douze
C´est dur abusé, coincé dans les cordes, je pense à décrocher la ceinture au pluriel
T´iras manger de l´ombre à la petite cuillère, car y´a pas de places pour deux gus 
Sur une civière, mec il faut que t´aime ox et kool shen
Ecoute cette chanson solide, comme un bout de chêne

Deserve to be born in the first place cause of my pigment

Dark than the Caucasoid complexion kind of different
On a Harley David is King David sayin' my tehillin'
Pistol in my waste and I'm wrapped in my tefillin'
On a camel like an Arab because Ishmael is my siblin'

I'm on my own thing, yes Moses
I don't part the sea I fly the jet across the ocean
Yeah, God's the one that wrote this
I'm just an instrument so make sure that you listen in

I'm from the block where there ain't no scholarships
Forced to do things that if she knew would make my momma sick
Larry Hoover was my tutor
Now I made tshuva from the king crown of Judah

Now I'm running through the trees, I got you all screaming please
I slay wicked with my tongue I fire missiles when I breathe
I'll give you all one reason to leave me be, before I bring you to your knees
With great catastrophes, I cast off shackles as I bleed

Some room I need to breathe and blast off as I please
With verses of praise that I slay when I sing
And a double edge sword that swings low by my knees
No need to gas a blow I stay low and then I feed

But when the time comes to go, I'm like Rambo
I got my cross bow, the cross winds blow
I'm so, radio, this wave activation
It got me living in slow mo
But now I'm ready to blow

It's getting hot, I'm heat seeking, fire breathing
Believing scriptures that I'm reading while you're wailing at the wall
I stand tall, and battle y'all
While them Kingdoms fall",King Crown of Judah,2012
Koool Kojak,"In the Earth, there are so many wonderful treasures.
And if you know where to dig, you will find gold, diamonds,

Return to the land of the rainbow
Where the sun hang low and the wind doth blow
And the tide it move so slow
Creeps and more through the window
Return to the land where the wild mare roam
And the buffalo go, yeah the buffalo go

Where the wild mare roam and
Cross the countryside search far and wide
Dig into the wheats upon the other side
Streams and the rivers and the oceans and the streets
Gonna swim with the fishes till I'm deep

Lift your eyes upon the other side
Sunrise and I fight to sleep through the night
Leap upon the skies on the clouds so high
When I fly by the heights feeling oh so right
Finally find the land and I'm kickin' up sand

When I stand and deliver the plan
Would you please back down
Or get slammed to the ground
When my slams strike thunder
While your village is under

Now you wonder why you going under
Got yo' self on the run from the number one
That you can't run from

Evertime I see you slippin'
I go and reach for my mac 10
Victims of my devils playground

Damn I'm about to bust a cap up in these tricks
Chris
I'm thinkin' deadly and I'm scopin' with that infarred
Kickin' it with the hardest click
Leavin' bodies rottin' up in them ditches
Man what's done if my tongue hits like a ton of brizicks
Koops not concerned
I let you burn and burn and burn
Everything in the prophecy has been demonically read
So I learned
Deep in the morgue
Lie corps in the quateras
They want to face in a line of order
Can you place this shit
When you crawled up on the red man
You bounce set up in this bitch
Sittin' man and thinkin'
Though my dreams I hear little kids screamin
Poor preachers I waited for hangin'
Which got me like bored in the psycho ward like daily
The 6-6-6 mystery man
Is takin' me straight to insanity
Could it be a dimension of witches that bring out voices
That issue more tragedies
The seas of cries
Will soon be turning
Your fuckin' life over
Left the priest and island bleeding of four leaf clover
Then I crinkle enough of these slugs
?? I'd rather be mugged to drink up a pint of his blood

You're not the demon in the dark
That you and I, yea we'd been through that

All the time it took you
Away from choosing?

So as you find yourself flying high up there
When you release me from your heart again (woo!)
I'm just a burning man trying to keep the ship
From turning over again
Cross the rich derivative of pain
Crush the burning in your heart

Kopek,"Would you hold me down
When I can't be still
When I'm cold and numb
Teach me how to feel

Keep me together
When I'm crackin up
Will you pull me out
If my feet get stuck fast

Won't you be my satellite
You must always be right
About most everything
Or panic bells will surely ring

I'm only waitin for you
In the Caribbean
Because I promised to
And I can't lie again

See it from my side
When no one agrees
Help me from the floor
Back onto my knees

Won't you be my satellite
You must always be right
About most everything
Or panic bells will surely ring

I'm only waitin for you
In the Caribbean
Because I promised to
And I can't lie again

There's somethin I have to do
So we can start again
It's what is owed to you
My Floridian

And we move into the light
And everything feels so right
Say that you'll hang around
And stop the sun from goin down

Kopek,"Shout from on top of the steeple
Shout from the tops of them trees
I feel a badness blowin on the breeze

Showin no sign of stoppin
Dust in the cuts in my knees
And sympathy no longer breeds with ease

And the watchers keep on watchin
And the doers keep on doin it to me

And I just had to tell you
I just had to make sure everyone knows
They're fighting in the streets again
Still trying to save their souls

And were supposed to be human
We're supposed to have figured out the world
And found something we can believe in
At least that's what I have heard

So keep on pilin your money
Pile it up to the sky
Then you can climb it to Jesus
You know he loves a man that tries

So come on darlin take shelter
I see that moon on the rise
Salvation's for sale and hates the currency that buys

And the watchers keep on watchin
And the doers keep on doin it to me

And were supposed to be human
We're supposed to have figured out the world
And found something we can believe in
At least that's what I have heard

Well they say it's just the way things go
But I know that love will grow
And sometimes it goes the other way too

And I can see into my brothers heart
I can see beneath his skin so dark
I can see that he's the same as me
I can see that when you cut he bleeds

Can't you see that when you cut we bleed
Can't you see that when you cut we bleed
Can't you see that when you cut we bleed

And I just had to tell you
I just had to tell you
I just had to tell you
I just had to tell you",Sub Human,2011

I hear their mouths making foreign sounds

Who's been killed and who's been kissed

Woda w oceanach jak w czarach spoczywa.
Ogien w kominach spala sie bezpiecznie.
Ziemia zamknieta slowem krazy po elipsie.
Powietrze przybiera ksztalt rzeczy dowolny.
Ja wciaz taka sama w gestach niespokojnych.
Zyjemy obok siebie spokojnie ________,
Gniew rozsadza formy, a tresc eksploduje!
Kto powstrzymac moze powietrze I wode?
Kto ziemi rozkaze cofnac rozzarzona lawe?
Kto stanie na drodze mego zniechecenia
Do form coraz ciasniejszych, ich przeznaczenia?

Ciemno I wstac nie moge.
Naciagam glebiej koldre,
Znikam, kule sie w sobie.
Powietrze, lepkie I geste,
Wilgoc osiada na twarzy.
Ptak smetny siedzi na drzewie,
Leniwie piora wygladza.
Ranek przechodzi w poludnie,
Bezwladnie mijaja godziny.
Czasem zabrzeczy mucha
W sidlach pajeczyny.
A slonce wysoko, wysoko
Swieci pilotom w oczy,
Ogrzewa niestrudzenie
Zimne, nibieskie przestrzenie.
Czekam na wiatr co roztrwoni
Ciemne, sklebione zaslone,
Stane wtedy na raz
Ze sloncem twarza w twarz.
Czekam na wiatr co roztrwoni
Ciemne, sklebione zaslone,
Stane wtedy na raz
Ze sloncem twarza w twarz.
Ulice mglami spowite
Tona w slepych kaluzach.
Przez okno patrze znuzona,
Z tesknota mysle o burzy...
A slonce wysoko, wysoko
Swieci pilotom w oczy,
Ogrzewa niestrudzenie
Zimne, nibieskie przestrzenie.

And it's time for me.
Why would I spend more time with people that I hate,
Couldn't wait to leave behind?
Would we dance, make a toast,
As you boast about the things that you haven't done.
Oh joy, the thrills, this is fun.
Down the hallways I still remember
The things you said.
And I hang my head low.
And I try not to feel.
So why would I spend more time with people that I hate,
Couldn't wait to leave behind?
Would we dance, make a toast,
As you boast about the things that you haven't done.
Oh joy, the thrills, fun fun.

Beautiful, you were, popular.
It's cool it's so cool. so cool.
Beautiful you were, popular.
It's cool, it's so cool. so cool.
Beautiful, you were, popular.
It's cool it's so cool. so cool.
Beautiful you were, popular.
It's cool, it's so cool. so cool.
Beautiful, you were, popular.
It's cool it's so cool. so cool.",Reunion,1999
Korea Girl,"You ever stop to think
About where you are now?
You tripped and you slipped 
On the things you thought you needed.
You died on your throne
And now you're left unseated.
Every tick of the tock
Is the time to start conceiving.
And you go undergrowth.
I know I'm lame, I know your sane
I hope you're defeated
Keep no angels (devils)",Upside Down,1999
Koree,"Ich hab den Eindruck, dass die Szene mich nicht fordert
Rapper sind wie Krebse, sie bewegen sich nicht vorwärts
Ham' Versagensängste und sind depressiongeplagt
Aber Kollegah kennt die Gefühle nicht wie'n Soziopath
Ich komm mit der Gun, hau' dir den Griff an den Schädel
Warum? Na, dich zu erschießen wär nicht so witzig gewesen
Ich geb dir Tritte und Schläge, solang bis deine Kiefer brechen
Nur um mich dann kaputtzulachen über dein schiefes Lächeln
Und dann sitz ich katzestreichelnd im Schreibtischstuhl
Schmeiß dich schwulen Bastard in meinen Haifischpool
Kid, es ist der Hustler aus Kanada
Hitrapper, Bitchslapper wie Rafael van der Vaart
Deine Sis bedient mich im Zweitwohnsitz in Wien
Kocht, wäscht und putzt, wofür sie Scheine von mir kriegt
Du kommst vorbei, doch sie hat Dienst und keine Zeit für dich, denn sie
Muss weiterwischen, als ob sie sich iPhone-Pics ansieht
Du bist stinkwütend, Kid, doch guck, der Job ist alles
Was die Arme über Wasser hält wie Schwimmflügel, Bitch
Yeah, Überkilla, Kühlergrill am Benz in mattschwarz
Kollegah der Boss, Koree, United Hustlers

Kein Respekt mehr
Ich fick' ab heute alles
Es ist niemals genug (du bist der Sohn einer Hure)

Es ist niemals genug
(bist der Sohn einer Hure)
Ich bin ein Hustler, kein Respekt mehr
Keiner kann mich stoppen

Rapper komm'n nicht klar und sie labern im Stillen
Doch würden sie bei Beefs nicht mal Veganer bezwingen
Ich starte durch, verliere nie den Faden wie Spinnen
Und mach das hier im Handumdreh'n wie Wahrsagerinnen
Mach kein Aufstand, du bekiffter Lauch, pass auf
Lauf, Junge, schwirr ab, die Browning wird entsichert
Kein Zauberspruch verhindert diesen Staudammbruch, du Stricher
Ich werd Schritt für Schritt reicher wie ein Saunaclubbesitzer
Du vertraust nicht der Intuition
Bist gefangen in Strukturen wie 'ne Institution
Und ich geb richtig Gas, denn ich will Millionen Flus
Oder sowas um den Dreh wie ein Filmstudio
Hast vor langer Zeit die Ehrlichkeit verkauft
Mittlerweile hat sich auch deine Herrlichkeit verbraucht
Deine Zeit ist jetzt vorbei, neue Player steigen auf
Und hast du mal einen Lauf, dann steckt er in deinem Maul
Die Party ist jetzt durch, du Zivilversager
Ich nehm die Sache ernst wie ein Familienvater
Und schalte einen Gang hoch, Knarre an den Kopf
Nemesis, Koree, Kollegah der Boss

Kein Respekt mehr

Koriass,"Ask not what you can do for your country
But what in the fuck has it done for you

Amérique du Nord, terre de liberté
Mais je choisis de rester dans ma grotte l’hiver pour hiberner
Des rayures rouges comme le sang des génocides
50 étoiles, une pour chacun de nos vices
Des rayures blanches comme la neige qui recouvre les tombes
Mon empire va s’étendre jusqu’au bout du monde
J’prie le sauveur des hommes pour protéger mes proches
Après que j’aie chargé mon gun pis que j’aie barré mes portes

J’me suis fait dire depuis que j’suis jeune que l’école c’est ça qui est important
Étudie pour avoir des bonnes notes pis sois pas insolent
Dès l’âge de 13 ans je savais que je voulais devenir un comédien
J’étais un petit con qui ne connaît rien, j’ai drop avant d’être collégien
Alcool et drogues qui run dans les veines, des soirées j’en ai connues plein
La fille tu la connais bien, tu te protèges pas, tu te soucies pas de l’hygiène
Mais la cigogne cogne, la fille s’imagine pas donner le sein
Elle avorte aussitôt qu’elle apprend qu’elle est en train de porter le tien
C’est là que tu tombes, puff une once, pas de diplôme, job de plonge
Sorry, mais t’es pas toujours gagnant quand tu récoltes le bronze
T’as envie de get ton hustle on, le faire ça prend 3 secondes
Le commis du Couche-Tard verrait fuck all si je sortais le chrome
J’me suis fait dire depuis que j’suis jeune que l’argent c’est ça qui est important
Fais c’que tu veux de ta vie tant que ton compte de banque est bien portant
Ma mère a fait de son mieux, s’est sacrifiée jusqu’à la chair pour m’élever bien
Mais j’ai été élevé par le rêve américain

[Safia Nolin]
La fresque est fausse, la fresque est monstre
On chantera ses louanges jusqu’à l’infini
Pourvu que le Dieu moqueur se montre
Les odeurs de ses grands mots pourris
Et puis s’étendra sur des kilomètres
Les couleurs de guerre et les auréoles
Non, nous ne sommes plus maîtres
In God we trust, for God we shop

Pour me déplacer je voulais des Vans à l'époque
Maintenant ce je veux c'est une Benz ou une Porsche 
Plein de crème dans les poches 
Avant je t'offrais une couple de cents pour une clope 
Maintenant je fume plus, mais je bois la fin de semaine dans les clubs 
C'est pas d'hier que je consomme, prendre une bière comme un homme 
Ça l'air que c'est le fun, surtout quand t'as la tête dans les chiottes 
On a des rêves d'être le boss, une wife qui a l'air d'une escorte 
Hollywood life en dessous des bright lights et des spots 
L'Amérique obèse témoigne du mal-être de l'époque 
On veut tellement être big, tout est tellement over the top
Supersize ta frite, supersize ton être, supersize ton fric
Supersize ton dick, vas-y kid supersize your life 
Un peuple qui est enterré en dessous du nine to five 
La droite, la gauche qui massacre la faune, terre et mer 
Tout est cool quand j'ai la face dans mon cell phone 
Sur ma tombe l'épitaphe ce sera un M jaune",Américain,2013
Koriass,"Mes pensées sont pêle-mêle, j’sais pas où est passée ma tête, man
La job pis les sidelines, mon boss pis son air bête
Quand c’est pas ça c’est le Fuzzy, les clubs et le night life
Les gars c’est des pervers pour les sluts et la chair fraîche
Donne-moi une scène, un mic pis j’les rock comme les White Stripes
Tu veux faire une scène, mes boys te cognent pis c’est bye bye
J’ai les neurones brûlés par ma connexion Wi-Fi
Next step dans ma carrière c’est faire d’la porn avec Mic Life
Dire qu’on est broke c’est la mode, j’pop des doses de Gravol
White JF Harrison avec des hoes de quatorze
T’es pas capable de saisir un mot que j’te cause sur l’album
Jamais sobre, 24/7 sur la Colt et la Bud
Arrête de t'mentir à toi-même, tu l’sais que j’suis le dopest rapper
J’ai jamais faussé la note, j’pourrais battle Loes pis Drama
J’vois most qui radote, mais j’suis l’seul à rocker Osheaga
J’t’ais posté là-bas ek du monde qui pensent qu’la coke c’est glamour
Avec ma Goldschläger, gros swagger, polo Lacoste 
Classy comme un Floridien bronzé à Boca Raton
Grosse manœuvre pour aller promote le solo album
Même si les barrières de langues font que j’vais jamais blow up platinum
Jamais rentré dans un Benz sauf au dealership
Aux danseuses à chaque semaine sur mon Dilla shit
Korey Lemay-Thivierge en chute libre d’un édifice
Degenerate mon bitterness, j’suis rendu sick of it
Mon alcoolisme pis mes études sont toujours on and off
40%, mon alcool c'est comme mes notes d’école
Vas-y puff des blunts comme un collégien, dis au prof qui connaît rien
Sans la drogue c’est poche de déconner sobre
Le rap queb est sur mon shish kebab 
Fais quelque chose de constructif boy, quit le rap
J’le sais qu’on est la voix des pauvres, pas des aristocrates
Philosophe de fin de semaine avec tes critiques sociales
J’veux cracher en l’air qu’ça vous atterrisse dans face
On veut envoyer chier la terre pis après split le cash
Quand j’frappe les bars appelle-moi Korey Winehouse
Étendu sur le sol mort, sorry I’m out

Les dudes de Limoilou qui boivent leur 12 à tous les jours
Qui ont trouvé l'amour et prennent leur cousine cute pour épouse
Mes boys paresseux qui utilisent encore Fruity Loops
Les transgenres qui voudraient des boobs sous leur blouse
Ceux qui dorment dans le satin blanc comme Moody Blues
Ceux qui dorment dans les parcs s’é bancs et vivent juste pour être saouls
Ceux qui se servent de leur femme pour pratiquer leur jiu-jitsu
Les Texans qui roulent dans des Hummer Jeeps bulletproof
Tous des fous, j’suis le seul à voir que le monde est mad
J’me suis trompé de planète, j’voudrais bouger avec ma blonde sur Mars
Me mettre des souliers de béton pis couler dans le fond d’un lac
Ou aller dépenser mon compte épargne sur des onces de Jack
J’ai l’impression qu’une balle m’apporterait un calme immense
Ça doit être pour ça qu’on dit « appuyer sur la détente »
Avant mon mind était sharp comme un ginsu
Avec le temps j'ai maîtrisé l’art de devenir fou",Devenir fou,2013
Koriass,"J'étais sous les blacklights, quelque part dans un party downtown
J'étais à l'écart de tous mes amis d'enfance
Chasing dreams, essayant de toucher mes rêves
Sans même avoir un oreiller où j'pouvais me coucher la tête
J'étais dans une autre vie, dans un autre monde
Dans une autre ville, un autre lit avec une autre blonde
J'étais entassé dans un trou, cassé comme un clou
Avec à peine un billet de 20 qui traîne pour aller prendre un coup
J'étais saoul fini, couché dans les toilettes du bar 
Les pensées black comme ma Guinness parce que je broyais du noir
Avec les jobs qui se font rares et le loyer qui part
J'avais pas les moyens de faire avec les moyens du bord
J'étais loin du but que je m'étais fixé way back
À l'âge où j'allais te rejoindre pour aller glisser din parcs
J'étais à quelque part en train de me saouler that night
Pendant que tu cherchais ta vie en dessous des blacklights

J'étais perdu, la tête dans un nuage de smoke
Pendant que tu faisais du slalom dans un bag de coke
J'étais dans mon appart, j'remplissais des pages de quotes
Mais devant la glace je regardais la face d'un autre
T'étais su'l bord de la noyade, le visage dans l'eau
Pendant que j'calais des Labatt dans le back d'un show
J'étais un enfant de l'asphalte pris dans un appart de banlieue
Toi tu faisais ton babyshower dans un afterhour
J'étais loin des jours de classe et des corridors
Perdant mon âme dans le floss et le money talk
J'étais loin des carrés de sable dans un shot de fort
L'amour est mort, on party hard dans un corbillard
J'ai des mémoires de toi qui cours près des ballons-poires
Maintenant c'est juste le vent qui souffle sur ta balançoire
J'étais quelque part en train de me saouler that night
Pendant que tu cherchais ta vie en dessous des blacklights

J'étais dans un char, sur un vélo
Dans un bus, ou un métro, dans un block, dans un ghetto
Je prenais des puffs sur un mégot, les menottes comme un étau pour une job pis un payroll
Je mélangeais le scotch pis les verres d'eau
Sur la brosse quand j'me levais tôt pour un boss pis un payroll
J'voulais la gloire comme un héros
Aller voir si y'a de l'or quelque part over the rainbow
Notre enfance qui meurt sous les bombes
Dans la peur et les pleurs et la honte
Sur le phone c'est ma sœur qui l'annonce
Pendant que s'arrêtaient les heures sur ta montre
La tête lourde mais le cœur sur la paume
T'as jamais bloom avant les fleurs sur ta tombe
J'étais quelque part en train de me saouler that night
Pendant que tu perdais ta vie en dessous des blacklights",Blacklights,2016
Koriass,"Mon premier ride c'était un Fisher Price
Là ma Civic me traine sur des milliers de kilomètres
Partir en ride, ouvrir les fenêtres juste pour respirer de l'air
Seul dans la nuit pis j'kill the lights juste pour le thrill de le faire
Feeling high c'est comme un hallucinogène
Seul avec moi-même c'est le seul moyen d'me clear le mind
J'pourrais partir en mer, essayer de rider sur un tide
J'pourrais partir en l'air, j'aime mieux garder mes pieds sur terre
Drive slow homie, fais pas du drift l'hiver
Au pire j'vais rapper through the wire dans un fil de fer
Slide sur la black ice, crash d'un camion qui déneige
J'aime mieux hop avec McFly pour voir le prochain millénaire
J'fais tout pour me sentir en vie while I'm still alive
Depuis l'jour où ma mère a enlevé les petites roues sur mon bicycle vert
J'crisse mon camp pis j'drive quand j'feel à l'envers
J'suis ben l'fils à mon père, un french kiss pis j'file à l'anglaise

Si j'suis gone dans mon char avec une pile de 100 dollars
Attends-moi pas ce soir parce que j'risque de rentrer tard
J'drive à 160, un 40 ounce dans l'entrejambe
Sache que j'tais dans l'tort si jamais j'rentrais dans le décor

J'vais peut-être prendre de l'âge avant le soir du grand départ
Ou me faire shot down dans la tempe pendant que j'rob une banque
J'drive à 160 dans une tempête en décembre
Mais sache que j't'aime encore si jamais j'manque mon angle mort

Nourri par les rêves de driver Bentley Merco
Là j'get dough, mais j'ai ride le bus jusqu'à 27, j'étais dead broke
Mon boy chauffe avec du XO dans un verre du McDo
Moi j'ai les yeux gros comme des 2 $, ben alerte sur le Redbull
Shades dans la face quand le soleil se couche
Enfant de l'asphalte qui a jamais fait de pouce
J'ride pour aller chercher le bread juste pour l'amour de mes kids
J'mets toujours les couches pour la petite bien avant le kush pour les spliffs
J'vais get le shit avec Freddie Gibbs dans mon tape
J'traine le M38 comme si c'était les chiffres de mon plate
Drive dans la ville j'me sens comme si j'faisais partie des greats
Que tout l'monde dit mon name comme Fifty, Biggie, P. Diddy ou Drake
J'sors de la ville and it's still the same

J'ai des idées qui sont pognées dans mon fucking brain
Des fois les trouver c'comme une aiguille dans une botte de foin
Murder murder kill kill avec mes hommes de main
Ça va finir, mais j'ai comme le feeling que c'est pas demain
Avant c'était le linge volé sur la corde à linge
Là c'est rendu les fringues données parce que j'les portais bien
We started from the bottom, là c'est bottles on the plane

Kid yourself until
Something feels different, but even
Down to your last breath
Can the worst bring out your best
Fake it 'till you make 
A name out of yourself again
Step up what is left of your game

À la recherche du Love Suprême, quête d'amour et de gloire
J'ai toujours porté les remords comme un tattoo sur le corps
J'ai fait les affaires comme un God mais fait un pacte avec le diable
Jamais camouflé mes flaws et toujours avoué mes torts
Y'a des amitiés qui cassent, les vieux amis prennent le bord
La minute où t'as le crown, tu vois la jalousie qui sort
Toujours battu pour le love, les shots partent de tous les bords
Mais protéger les proches ce sera à la vie à la mort
J'voulais juste ride avec les buddys, getting high, faire des folies
Living life, getting money, être le maître de cérémonie
Biting into life, j'en ai de la chair sur les canines
Avec les deux yeux sur le prize pour le rêve que j'imagine
What's life after death pour un white rapper queb
Pas de secondaire et pas de cégep, tu laisses la wife avec les dettes
La tête dans le ciel, l'envie de fly avec les jets
J'veux crier « j'vais jamais perdre », pas chanter l'air de la défaite

Write down your last will
Don't keep it all in
So your glory still can live 
Build a monument
Your body can rest as long as
No one forgets

Kid yourself until
Something feels different, but even
Down to your last breath
Can the worst bring out your best
Fake it 'till you make 
A name out of yourself again
Step up what is left of your game

Jamais voulu d'un nine to five, j'étais comme « work c'est pour les losers »
Les yeux fixés sur le rêve même si tout l'monde autour est douteux
Tout pour me sentir alive, j'bois mes coups durs dans mes shooters
Devant la foule getting high ou sous les couvertes juste nous deux
Grain de sable dans le désert ou goutte de pluie dans l'océan
J'veux laisser quelque chose derrière comme un bruit dans le néant
Qu'on se souvienne que j'étais une bête, j'étais un héros, j'étais une légende
Un air qui joue dans ta tête parce que ton cerveau c'est mon playground
Mais c'est pas c'que je voulais être, j'ai vendu mon âme pour une place
En dessous des spotlights, j'ai blanchi mes dents pour les flashs
Pour entrer dans la légende, j'en aurais vendu ma mère
J'voulais déranger les gens, pas entrer dans le ventre de la bête
Mettre une étampe sur le temps, mettre de l'essence sur la braise
J'ai perdu qui je suis vraiment pendant ma descente aux enfers
Criez mon nom pour le monde, répandez mes cendres dans la mer
Parce que ce soir le Roi est mort, enlevez le crown sur ma tête

Somewhere along the Rio Grande
Sadly I'm reminiscing, madly again I'm kissing

It happened in Monterey, a long time ago
I met her in Monterey, in old Mexico
Stars and steel guitars
And luscious lips, as red as wine
Broke somebody's heart
And I'm afraid that it was mine
It happened in Monterey
Without thinking twice
I left her and threw away the key to paradise
My indiscreet heart, longs for the sweetheart 
That I left in old Monterey
 
Making believe I'm merry
In ev'ry glass of sherry
I see the sparkle of her eye
And when I hear the cello
Tender and sweet and mellow
I hear the music of her sigh

Natives kneel in prayer by their caravans.

There, silhouetted under and eastern star,

Old temple bells are calling across the sand.
We'll find our Kismet, answering love's command.

Heaven will guide us, Allah will bless our love.",Misirlou,1996

From glen to glen, and down the mountain side.

It's you, it's you must go and I must bide.

But come ye back when summer's in the meadow,
Or when the valley's hushed and white with snow,
It's I'll be here in sunshine or in shadow,
Oh, Danny boy, oh Danny boy, I love you so!

But when ye come, and all the flowers are dying,
If I am dead, as dead I well may be,
You'll come and find the place where I am lying,
And kneel and say an Ave there for me.
And I shall hear, though soft you tread above me,
And all my grave will warmer, sweeter be,
For you will bend and tell me that you love me,
And I shall sleep in peace until you come to me!",Danny Boy,2000

There's a place inside my mind, a place I like to hide
You don't know the chances. What if I should die?!
A place inside my brain, another kind of pain
You don't know the chances. I'm so blind!

Another place I find to escape the pain inside
You don't know the chances. What if I should die?!
A place inside my brain, another kind of pain
You don't know the chances. I'm so blind!

Deeper and deeper and deeper
As I journey to live a life that seems to be a lost reality
That I could never find a way to reach my inner self esteem is low
How deep can I go in the ground that I lay
If I don't find a way to sift through the grey that clouds my mind
This time I look to see what's between the lines

I can see, I can see, I'm going blind
I'm blind!",Blind,

Dig it cause I get wicked

People wanna know how come
I gotta gat and I'm lookin out the window like Malcolm
Ready to bring that noise
Kinda trigger happy like the Geto Boys
April 29th was power to the people
and we might just see a sequel
cos police got equal pay
A horse is a pig that don't fly straight
Doin Darryl Gates but is Willie Williams
down with the pilgrims
Just a super slave
We'll have to break his ass up like Super Dave
I'm wicked enough to board this
Cos now it's on to the fullest
Gorilla straight from the mist
But I don't miss when it comes to this
Bring the yellow tape
The white cape, cause I'm so straight
Thru with the picket signs, take his job and stick it
Bigot, cause I get wicked

Get your boogie on

Hate, something, someway, each day, dealing with no forgiveness
Why? This shit inside
Now everyone will follow
So give me nothing just feel

I don't feel your deathly ways
Each day I feel so hollow, inside I was beating me
You will never see, so come dance with me

Dance with me

When all through the house
Everybody was stoned
Even the mouse

Man from the whore house
And me from jail
I just settled down
To get a piece of her tail

When all of a sudden
I heard such a clatter
I tripped on my dick
And busted my bladder

I went downstairs
And what did I see?
A fat little red fagget
Hangin' from a tree

He stuffed the stockings
With reefers and beer
And a big fat hairy dick
For the family queer

That's the end of my story
Funny wasn't it, ya see?

She didn't even
She didn't see my thing behind ya
Leave ya for this private eye
I was there to give 'em near to my
Zima zima mommy fah

I'm gonna say this
Hope it don't offend ya
Came to the grizma
Give 'em a taste of me
Give 'em a little excitement to the damn monkey
Your monkey can stay with me
Ahh, ahh, ahh

Chevy took my brain
Same old motherfucker, sucked my dick that day
He will never zima zima
Never, never not that day

I'm really sick of all this excitement
Yeah, but he thinks he's better than me

Okay, I've got a question
Can I throw it all away?
Take back what's mine

Surely they have gangs by now
There is no gun to shoot them down

I run to them like Pavlov?s dogs

Kidnap the Sandy Claws
Lock him up real tight
Throw away the key and then
Turn off all the lights

First we're going to set some bait
Inside a nasty trap and wait
When he comes a-sniffing
We will snap the trap and close the gate

Wait, I've got a better plan
To catch this big red lobster man
We'll pop him in a boiling pot
And when he's done we'll butter him up

Kidnap the Sandy Claws
Throw him in a pot
Leave him there for ninety years
Then see if he talks

But Mr. Ogey Bogey Man
Can take the holding over then
He'll be so pleased, I do declare
That he will cook him rare

I say that we take a canon
Aim it at his door and then
Knock three times, and when he answers
Sandy Claws will be no more

Your so stupid now
If blow him up to smithereens
We may loose some pieces
And then Jack will be

Kidnap the Sandy Claws
Tie him in a bag
Throw him in the ocean then
See what makes him sad

Slaps you across your fat ass, with a fat dick

Before you opened up your gap
I had respect for ya lady
But now I take it all back
Cause you gave me all your pussy
And ya even licked my balls
Leave your number on the cabinet
And I promise baby, I'll give ya a call
Next time I'm feeling kinda horny
You can come on over, and I'll break you off
And if you can't fuck, that day, baby

I know the pussy's mines, I'ma fuck a couple more times
And then I'm through with it, there's nothing else to do with it
Pass it to the homie, now you hit it
Cause she ain't nothing but a bitch to me

With a fat dick for your motherfucking mouth

Cause when bitches get skinless and pull a voodoo
What you gon do?  You really don't know
So I'd advise you not to trust that hoe
Silly of me to fall in love with a bitch
Knowing damn well, I'm too caught up with my grip
Now as the sun rotates and my game grows bigger
How many bitches want to fuck this nigga named Snoop
Doggy, I'm all the above
I'm too swift on my toes to get caught up with you hoes
But see, it ain't no fun, if my homies can't get a taste of it
Cause you know I don't love em

Whoa!
Hey, now ya know, inhale, exhale with my flow
One for the money, two for the bitches
Three to get ready, and four to hit the switches
In my Chevy, six-fo' Rad to be exact
With bitches on my side, and bitches on back
So back up bitch 'cause I'm struggling, so get
Off your knees and then start juggling

Fight your battles for you
They gon' wonder how you sleep at night
Won't He do it?
Ah yes, He will

You gon' look back and be so amazed
How it turned out
It's only His grace

So, I trust Him at all times

Koryn Hawthorne,"The atmosphere is changing
Nothing stays the same
Heaven is waiting
For the mention of the Name
The Spirit is moving
Burning like a flame
Healing the broken
By the One we proclaim

Raise it up
Fill the sky
Chains will fall
Mountains move
We lift Him high

Speak the Name
The Name above all other names
Speak the Name
The Name the wind and waves obey
All of heaven's coming down
Fill the earth with the sound

Hostages of shame
Miracles unfolding
At the mention of the Name
Our darkness is fleeing
Mercy raining down
Healing waters flowing
As our lips make the sound

Chains will fall

Koryn Hawthorne,"They told you that you couldn't do it 'cause you washed up
Ain't like them bad girls, said you should get your sauce up
But I got this plan and you might not understand
I'ma go hard as I can, and I'm gon' be the boss of it
Just watch me do this, put no limits only swagger on it
Walk right up to the front where I belong and brag on it
Go to the top, I'ma give it all I got
Might take a lot but we ain't gon' ever stop

I do believe I'm something special
Can't take that from me
So you can say what you want and I go harder, stronger
Be who I'm supposed to be

'Cause I'm unstoppable, I get all the way in it
That's the way I was made and I'm up on my business
'Cause I'm unstoppable, ain't no hoping and wishing
Say a prayer, catch your wave, then I go out and get it
'Cause I can be what I want, try it if I want
I'm powered by the King and He won't let me fall
'Cause I'm unstoppable, nah, nah, nah, He won't let me fall
No, no, no, no, no, 'cause I'm unstoppable

I dream about it, I go get it, that's how I do it
Not in the stars, I'm not lucky I just pray through it
Fall on my face and I make mistakes but I
Don't let it break me 'cause I'm still on my way

I do believe I'm something special
Can't take that from me
So you can say what you want and I go harder, stronger
Be who I'm supposed to be

'Cause I'm unstoppable, I get all the way in it
That's the way I was made and I'm up on my business
'Cause I'm unstoppable, ain't no hoping and wishing
Say a prayer, catch your wave, then I go out and get it
'Cause I can be what I want, try it if I want
I'm powered by the King and He won't let me fall
'Cause I'm unstoppable, nah, nah, nah, He won't let me fall
No, no, no, no, no, 'cause I'm unstoppable

Come what may, I rest in His safety
Winds may blow, the waves won't overtake me
Tears in my eyes but I'm still gon' survive
'Cause He's incredible, He's powerful
And I will rise from the bottom 'cause He said so

'Cause I'm unstoppable, I get all the way in it
That's the way I was made and I'm up on my business
'Cause I'm unstoppable, ain't no hoping and wishing
Say a prayer, catch your wave, then I go out and get it

Kosha,"I drop the verses y'all don't deliver
Take the chances y'all won't consider
Got a loyal broad named Betty who
Know what to do with that chrome I give her
I'm on the shitter
Thinkin' 'bout my bank account and how to make it bigger
Then I grab the tool and take your jewels
And I'ma watch this blew the same as Jigga's
It ain't the liquor I'm really sick, smokin' Shwag eatin Crystal chicks
On a rollercoaster with Bo and Kosha
Can't even fuck witch'all pencil dicks
Ain't this some shit?
Every time we step inside the club y'all tryna guess 
Which one of us gon' snatch your bitch
And leave you strokin' all by yourself
Understand this Bubba Sparxxx, S-P-A-are-triple X
I sprinkle soul in your pussy hole 
And put some coal on your nipple and neck
Tell your man, if he flex it's gettin drastic, legend has it
I know this mob spell G-A and with no delay they'll let him have it
It's just a habit, reppin' Athens and LaGrange, it's in my veins
I'm mixin Beam with Coke and (?), and every time it's still just the same
I tend to aim towards spittin' thangs, it's classical so masterful
When it comes to this here make the shit clear
Heard to y'all comes natural

[Chorus]
We make these lames wanna fight, make these bitches wanna fuck
Drink Bourbon in a cup, if it's bumpin' turn it up
We gon' weave, we gon' roll, watch the Franklin faces fold
Chasin multi-platinum plaques while y'all settlin' for dough
Drop that liquid on yo' tongue, put that reefer in your lungs
Close the curtains here we come, boy hush until I'm done
We gon' drink, we gon' smoke, keep that floss on they toes
When these broads start some lickin', we just might end up with your

Step in the club it's on
Nevertheless gonna find the somebody I could sip on
A seat with a view in the V.I.P., and got two tight things to grip on
A bag of trees to put my lip on - gotta cut it, roll it, light it, pass
And me and Bubba gettin' crunk in the club 
With a tape full of Bud in a champagne glass
Puttin' it down for the B.C., in the backwoods where we be
Better call a producer when you see me
And get your ass right back in the GT
Y'all lame boys, hangin up lookin' just for a name boy
Goin upsize with the Game Boy
Witcho' mind right go out lookin' for a cane boy, it's a shame boy
You the main one tryna stall right, sold the broads out the game boy
I beat 'em down like chop chop chop
Yessuh, cut 'em up and leave 'em alone
On my cell phone they callin', talkin' 'bout ""Kosha baby, call me""
Leave your name and your number at the sound of the beep
And I'll get back witcha shawty
Most hated by baby daddies for breakin' up happy homes
When the men is on and she don't say no then that mean she wanna bone
So partna don't get me wrong, I'm just bein Kosha
That Southern playa with a stroke that keep 'em wet like a ocean
Yessuh, me and Bubba get rowdy (rowdy)
And me and Bubba get bout it (bout it)
We are violators we annihilate you, no ifs ands buts about it
The air up here stay cloudy, I originate in shotcallin'
We stay up in the club y'all look at us
And say, ""Damn, them boys be ballin""

[Chorus]

Whassup fuck nigga, man you know who you is (you know)
You the ones be payin' hoes and buyin' them gifts (trick ass)
You mad when you find out some other niggaz get it
Ain't payin' no bills just stayin' real and still be hittin' it
I'm a old school playa I just pay for her dinner
Maybe buy a little liquor I spend some talk in the mirror
This the playa from the soul; love to gang up on hoes
I'm tryna let this pimp shit go cause I don't even like it no mo'
See these niggaz that I hang with they just run through these skanks
Talk about 'em over dinner, pass women like dank

Mmm-hmm, and I'ma put twenty-five
On the them ol' fire ass Mercedes Rolls
That don't never come 'round no mo' that shit right dere
Country-ass Bubba Sparxxx, ain't no fuckin around wit G.O. again
That put me in this backwoods committee
My ace Kosha, Bo Hagin, west central Georgia's finest
Man Bo, go on snap again

Man, I'm gon' tell it like it is, I'm gon' sit the rear
I stand true to high live, this a quest for a mil'
It done took a nigga different places, seen plenty of faces
Whatever may have been the cases I thank God for his graces
See my knife'll tell the fakers, kept me spinnin' like breakers
And every day I play awake a nigga learnin' by haters
See I take a ho, and shake a ho, that's how we live
All women ain't bitches but see most of them is, uhh
