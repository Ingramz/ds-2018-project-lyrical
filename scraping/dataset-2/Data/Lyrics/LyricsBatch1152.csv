The Jordanaires,"The chimes of time ring out the news
Another day is through
Someone slipped and fell
Was that someone you?

You may have longed for added strength
Your courage to renew
Do not be disheartened
For I have news for you

It is no secret what God can do
What He's done for others, He'll do for you
With arms wide open, He'll pardon you
It is no secret what God can do

There is no night for in His light
You never walk alone
Always feel at home
Wherever you may go

There is no power can conquer you
While God is on your side
Take Him at His promise
Don't run away and hide

It is no secret what God can do
What He's done for others, He'll do for you
With arms wide open, He'll pardon you
It is no secret what God can do",It Is No Secret (What God Can Do),2001
The Jordanaires,"I'm satisfied with just a cottage below
A little silver and a little gold
But in that city where the ransomed will shine
I want a gold one that's silver lined

I've got a mansion just over the hilltop
In that bright land where we'll never grow old
And some day yonder we will never more wander
But walk on streets that are purest gold

Don't think me poor or deserted or lonely
I'm not discouraged I'm heaven bound
I'm but a pilgrim in search of the city
I want a mansion, a harp and a crown

I've got a mansion just over the hilltop
In that bright land where we'll never grow old
And some day yonder we will never more wander
But walk on streets that are purest gold",Mansion Over the Hilltop,2001
The Jordanaires,"Every day, I tell myself, it's temporary 
That it's only 'cause she's young 
That makes her want... another man 

Even though she makes me feel unnecessary 
I've found a way to help me understand 

I've got this drinkin' thing 
To keep from thinkin' things 
About where you've been 
Who you've been with 
What you've done 

And it's a lonely thing 
But, it's the only thing 
To keep a foolish man in love 
Hangin' on. 

If I wait at home, I'll only ask her questions 
She'd probably the truth, so I don't even ask 
So, I sit here on this barstool, feelin' helpless 
And I wonder, just how long, a man can last 

I've got this drinkin' thing 
To keep from thinkin' things 
About where you've been 
Who you've been with 
What you've done 

And it's a lonely thing 
But it's the only thing 
To keep a foolish man in love 
Hangin' on.

I've got this drinkin' thing 
To keep from thinkin' things 
About where you've been 
Who you've been with 
What you've done.",Drinkin' Thing,2001
The Jordanaires,"I never intended 
To even know your name 

Except for the woman waitin' at home 
They've all been the same
I've always been true 
Except for you 

Not even a one night stand 
And I never intended 
For it to get so 
Out of hand 

Out of hand, out of hand 
I'm a hard-living kind of a man 
I need more to keep me goin' 
Than this gold wedding band 

You're my kind of woman 
I'm your kind of man 
Maybe that's the reason 
It got so, out of hand 

I never intended 
For it to go this far 
I don't think I can get off 
From where we are 

Some time to waste 
So just a taste 
Was all, that I had planned 

And I never intended 
For it to get so 
Out of hand 

Out of hand, out of hand 
I'm a hard living kind of a man 
I need more to keep me goin' 
Than this gold wedding band 

You're my kind of woman 
And I'm your kind of a man 
Maybe that's the reason 
It got so, out of hand 

Out of hand, out of hand 
I'm a hard loving kind of a man 
I need more to keep me goin' 
Than this gold wedding band",Out of Hand,2001
The Jordanaires,"To God be the glory great things He hath done
So loved He the world that He gave us His son
Who yielded His life an atonement for sin
And opened the life gate that all may go in

And to God be the glory
To God be all praise
We live for Your glory
All of our days
To God be all glory and praise

O perfect redemption, the purchase of blood
To every believer the promise of God
The vilest offender who truly believes
That moment from Jesus a pardon receives

And to God be the glory
To God be all praise
We live for Your glory
All of our days
To God be all glory and praise

Great things he hath taught us great things he hath done
And great our rejoicing through Jesus the son
But purer and higher and greater will be
Our wonder our transport when Jesus we see

And to God be the glory
To God be all praise
We live for Your glory
All of our days
To God be all glory and praise",To God Be the Glory,2001
The Jordanaires,"It hurts me to see him treat you the way that he does
It hurts me to see you sit and cry
When I know I could be so true
If I had someone like you
It hurts me to see those tears in your eyes

The whole town is talking, they're callin' you a fool
For listening to his same old lies
And when I know I could be so true
If I had someone like you
It hurts me to see the way he makes you cry

You love him so much, you're too blind to see
He's only playing a game
He's never loved you, he never will
And darling, don't you know he' ll never change

I know that he never will set you free
Because he's just that kind of guy
But if you ever tell him you're through
I'll be waiting for you

Waiting, to hold you so tight
Waiting, to kiss you goodnight
Yes, darling, if I had someone like you",It Hurts Me,2001
The Jordanaires,"You're so young and beautiful and I love you so
Your lips so red, your eyes that shine
Shame the stars that glow

So fill these lonely arms of mine
And kiss me tenderly
Then you'll be forever young
And beautiful to me

You're so young and beautiful, you're everything I love
Your angel smile, your gentle touch
Are all I'm dreaming of

Oh take this heart I offer you
And never set me free
Then you'll be forever young
And beautiful to me",Young and Beautiful [From Jailhouse Rock],2001
The Jordanaires,"Oh they tell me of a home far beyond the skies
Oh they tell me of a home faraway 
Oh they tell me of a home where no storm clouds rise

O the Land of an unclouded day

The Jordanaires,"Build it up, knock it down
Hold it square, roll it around
Throw it in the air, stick it in the ground

But it's too bad, I can't get mad
Cause I'm a roustabout

Tie it loose, make it tight
If it's wrong, do it right
Makes me kinda feel like I wanna fight

But it's too bad, I can't get mad
Cause I'm a roustabout

Orders all day and half the night, from the boss
That guys cousin don't wanna see one minute lost

Stack it up, in the rig
Better still, bring it here
Wanna take it out stick it in his ear

But it's too bad, I can't get mad
Cause I'm a roustabout

A handyman is all I am around this place
Every time I turn around he's right up in my face

Bring it in, drag it out
When I'm slow, boy he shouts
Gettin aweful tired runnin' in and out

But it's too bad, I can't get mad
Cause I'm a roustabout

The Jordanaires,"King Creole
There's a man in New Orleans
Who plays rock and roll
He's a guitar man
With a great big soul
He lays down a beat
Like a ton of coal
He goes by the name of King Creole

You know he's gone, gone, gone
Jumpin' like a catfish on a pole
You know he's gone, gone, gone
Hip-shaking King Creole

When the king starts to do it
It's as good as done
He holds his guitar
like a Tommy gun
He starts to growl
From way down his throat
He bends a string
And that's all she wrote

You know he's gone, gone, gone
Jumpin' like a catfish on a pole
You know he's gone, gone, gone
Hip-shaking King Creole

Well, he sings a song about a crawdad hole
He sings a song about a jelly roll
He sings a song about meat and greens
He sings some blues about New Orleans

You know he's gone, gone, gone
Jumpin' like a catfish on a pole
You know he's gone, gone, gone
Hip-shaking King Creole

Well, he plays something evil
Then he plays something sweet
No matter what he plays
You got to get up on your feet

When he gets the rockin' fever
Baby, heaven sakes
He don't stop playin'
'Till his guitar breaks

It's been one hill after another
And I've climbed them all one by one

Tired of the grief and the strife,
So tired of working for nothing
Just tired of being my wife

She took my pride and my joy
She took my reason for living
She took my small baby boy

Well I've been left for dead on the road of love.
I was doin' high speed with a load of love
Forgot the first creed in the code of love.
All's fair in love and war.

Well I'm an honest man and I try to be true.
I did unto her like I'll do unto you.
Now you prefer to tell me we're through.
I'm bleedin' through my shirt and tie.
I'm bleedin' and I'll tell you why.

Well now who is the guy and when did he come?
When did he start to go beatin' your drum?
Well he's hittin' on you. I'm feelin' numb
And she don't believe a word I told her.
I'm cryin' on a gravel shoulder.

[Chorus]

Watch what you're doin'.
Look where you're goin'.
Give me a signal.
Some way of knowin'.
Well now who's at the wheel in the life that drove by.
I could swear it was her made me shift into high.
She's got those dangerous curves
And they're wrackin' my nerves
She always wiggles and swerves.
She's gonna give her driver everything he deserves.

Well now who could want this to lie here alone
With a palate of bricks, a pillow of stone.
Well to think that one kiss pulled me out o' my zone
And I wonder what's the change inside her?

Singing sweetly through the night, 
And the mountains in reply 
Echoing their brave delight.

Why these songs of happy cheer? 
What great brightness did you see? 
What glad tiding did you hear?

Come to Bethlehem and see 
Him whose birth the angels sing; 
Come, adore on bended knee 
Christ, the Lord, the new-born King.

Jack Frost nipping at your nose
Yule-tide carols being sung by a choir
And folks dressed up like Eskimos.

Everybody knows a turkey and some mistletoe
Help to make the season bright
Tiny tots with their eyes all aglow
Will find it hard to sleep tonight.

They know that Santa's on his way
He's loaded lots of toys and goodies on his sleigh
And every mother's child is gonna spy
To see if reindeer really know how to fly.

Their old familiar Carols play
And wide and sweet the words repeat
Of peace on earth good will to man

I thought as now this day had come
The belfries of all Christendom
Had rung so long the unbroken song
Of peace on earth good will to man

And in despair I bowed my head
There is no peace on earth I said
For hate is strong and marks the song

She'll remain the rose of my heart
Mom took sick along in December
February brought us broken hearts

The reason we've not called the family reunion
We knew that she wouldn't be there
But since we've thought it all over, mama
We know that your spirit is there

No, no, I can't forget the hours
You're the onliest one, mom
And sweeter than the flowers
No, no, there's no need to bother
To speak of you now would only hurt father

It looks so good to see us together
But I had to look after dad
Oh mama, when I passed by your coffin
I didn't want to remember you dead

They all gathered 'round, I stared at their faces
All heads were bowed mighty low
But that was one time we all had to face it
It hurt us so bad you know

No, no, I can't forget the hours
You're the onliest one, mom

If you could learn to love me by and by

The Joytones,"The night is like a lovely tune
Beware my foolish heart
How white the ever constant moon
Take care my foolish heart

There's a line between love and fascination
That's hard to see, how many names such as this
For they both have the very same sensation
When you're locked in the magic of a kiss

Her lips are much too close to mine
Beware my foolish heart
But should our eager lips combine
Then let the fire start

For this time it isn't fascination
Or a dream that will fade and fall apart
It's love, this time it's love

I tell you I mean it

The satisfaction of your love
So I've been walking home alone
Cause you left me out in the cold

But you know it won't be long before I have to put your picture down
Just take it down you gave her up

I cant hear you baby
When you tell me you don't want me now
So I'll be hanging by the phone
Though I know you'll never make the call
Don't make that call he'll put you down

I know that I could never be your man

Wish I could undo the time
I was walking home alone
So dejected by my own design

I still got all my love to give

The Jubilaires,"I'm recalling times when I was small, in light and free jubilee days,
Old folks praying everybody swaying,
Loudly, I chanted my praise.
How I sang about the Judgement morn,
And of Gabriel tooting on his horn.
In that sunny land of milk and honey,
I had no complaints,
While I thought of Saints
So I say to all who feel forlorn:

Sing ""Hallelujah! Hallelujah!"" and you'll shoo the blues away:
When cares pursue you, ""Hallelujah!""
Gets you through the darkest day.
Satan lies awaiting and creating skies of grey,
But ""Hallelujah! Hallelujah!""
Helps to shoo the clouds away.",Hallelujah,1955
The Jubilate Singers,"I used to think that I could not go on
And life was nothing but an awful song

I believe I can fly
I believe I can touch the sky
I think about it every night and day
Spread my wings and fly away
I believe I can soar
I see me running through that open door
I believe I can fly
I believe I can fly
I believe I can fly

See I was on the verge of breaking down
Sometimes silence can seem so loud
There are miracles in life I must achieve
But first I know it starts inside of me, oh

If I can see it, then I can be it
If I just believe it, there's nothing to it

Did families really bow their heads to pray
Did daddies really never go away?

Sometimes it feels like this world's gone crazy
And Grandpa, take me back to yesterday
When the line between right and wrong
Didn't seem so hazy

Did lovers really fall in love to stay
And stand beside each other, come what may?
Was a promise really something people kept
Not just something they would say and then forget
Did families really bow their heads to pray
Did daddies really never go away?
Oh, Grandpa, tell me 'bout the good old days

Grandpa, everything is changing fast
We call it progress, but I just don't know
And Grandpa, let's wander back into the past
And paint me the picture of long ago

The Judds,"Here's a little girl playin' dress up
Somewhere under all that lace
Standin' in her mama's high heeled shoes
With a lipstick covered face
And here's a little boy on a pony
He's a cowboy all the way
He used to pull my hair and make me mad
At the Saturday matinee
Who would've thought that I'd lose my heart
To the same little boy someday

Lookin' through my old pictures
Faded photographs
Some of them bring me close to tears
Others make me laugh
Old memories seem to come alive
And open up the past again
And let me dream inside
 
Here's brother with his first automobile
Thought he'd washed the paint away
He took a job that took him West
He's doing very well
We don't see much of brother these days
And this is my favorite of my papa 
He's dressed up in his Sunday suit
A wide brimmed hat, a watch on a chain
Well, I'm gonna tell you the truth
It's a picture of a downright handsome man
Caught in the prime of his youth

Lookin' through my old pictures
Faded photographs
Some of them bring me close to tears
Others make me laugh
Old memories seem to come alive
And open up the past again
And let me dream inside

There you stood beside me
I wonder now were you there all the time
Like a rose beneath the snow I've been waiting
And it took your kiss to make me come alive

Sleeping heart, love is all around you
Empty arms, what are you waiting for
Rub your eyes your handsome prince has found you
Sleeping heart, Sleep no more

In my slumber I kept seeing someone
And I recognized you when your lips touched mine

The Judds,"One day a mother
Come to a prison
To see an 'erring
But precious son
She told the warden
How much she loved him
It did not matter
What he had done

[Chorus]
She did not bring to him
(Bring to him)
Parole or pardon
(Pardon free)
She brought no silver
(Brought no gold)
No pomp nor style
(Him to see)
It was a halo
(Halo bright)
Sent down from heaven
(Heaven's light)
The sweetest gift
(A mother's smile)

Her boy had wandered
Far from the far side
Though she had pleaded
With him each night
But not a word did
She ever utter
That told her heartaches
Her smile was bright

She left a smile
You can remember
She's gone to heaven
From heartache's free
Them bars around you
Will never change her

Love, talk about love
Why do you always
want to talk about love?
Love, talk about love
Why do you always
want to talk about it?

I say that love
Is something you feel
You know in your heart
If it's real
But you've got to analyze
Organize, synchronize, formalize
And compromise

[Chorus]

I say love
It's like when you sing
You move to the music
When the words don't mean a thing
But, know you've got to clarify
Define it and refine it
Align and realign it

You don't have to understand

The Judds,"Met my first love down in Texas
In a club in San Anton'
Both of us were lonely
Had no one to call our own
So we danced and laughed 'til closin' time
And had no place to go
So with the top pulled down, drove all night
Run off to Mexico
But my blond haired blue eyed cowboy
Turned out to be bad news
Disappeared one morning
Left his old boots and the blues
Now there's been so many others
But none of them were true
The only one I could count on
To keep me company is you

When I'm all alone

We'll you'd think by now that I'd have learned
To see through your disguise
A heartache really shouldn't be
So hard to recognize
But you wear so many face
Every line is new
And somehow I just always end up
Wakin' up with you

Talking to her friends about people they knew 
And a lot the things that young girls do

When she said you see that guy in the baseball cap
I'd like to spend some time with a boy like that
Betty said I seen him at the hardware store
I think his name is Billy, but I'm not sure

And as they talked a little while he passed by
She smiled at him he just said ""hi""
He was thinking to him self as he walked away
Man I'd like to find a girl like her someday

Their gonna make it through the hard times

We'll she just couldn't stop her self from thinking about him
And at a store downtown she saw him again
She had both hands full
He held open the door

Said my name is Billy
I've seen you before
Can I help you with these 
Can I give you a ride

Can I take you out on a Saturday night
She didn't have to say what she was feeling inside
He could see the answer shining in her eyes

[Chorus]

Well from that day on
You couldn't keep them apart
They were side by side, heart to heart
Momma cried as Billy slipped the ring on her hand
And when the baby was born she was crying again

Well he worked real hard and put some money down
On a little old house at the edge of town
And that night as he held her he couldn't believe
That god had made a girl that he'd never ever leave

When i kissed you

Who never did dream
Of ever leaving southern Arizona
Or ever hearing wedding bells ring
He never had a lot of luck with the ladies
But he sure had a lot of good working skills
Never cared about climbing any ladder
He knew the way in a small cafe, found the will

He met Miss Bonnie
And a little bit of her was a little too much
A few movies and a few months latter
The feeling got strong enough
They didn't own a car 
So it must have been love
That drove him uptown for a diamond
That's when he started goin?

Over the line
Working overtime
To give her things just to hear her say she don't deserve them
But he loves her and he just kept going overboard
Over the limit to afford to give her things he knew she wanted
'Cause without her where would he be?
See, it's not for him
She is his only need

Ring on her finger and one on the ladder
A new promotion every now and then
Bonnie worked until she couldn't tie her apron
Then stayed at home and had the first of two children
And my, how the time did fly
The babies grew up and moved away
Left 'em sitting on the front porch rocking
And Billy watching Bonnie's hair turn gray

And every once in a while you could see him get up 
And he's head downtown
'Cause he heard about something she wanted
And it just had to be found
Didn't matter how simple or how much
It was love 
And, boy, ain't that love just something

Love receive this Romeo
Novice see, novice go
Novice shake and need someone to rip him through this ride
Radiance reveal itself
Have someone say him beautiful
Beautiful beyond the lie that flesh will tell the truth

[Chorus]",All Day Afternoon,1993
The JudyBats,"There's no sense in coming to your senses
Our best ideals walk on barbed-wire fences
All blood runs thin when reality dispenses
Tall tales unfold
And peasant becomes princess

[CHORUS]
We don't all have vision but some of us can see
The sweet dulcinea rapt in everything
I've made my decision; delirious and free
We don't all have vision but some of us can see
I saw you there
Winnowing the black wheat, singing a dry dusty song
Flat as the hulls at your feet
Mi Aldonza
In your hardened features
Nothing replete, neither coy nor splendid
All rags and cursing in the white heat
Conoci con mi aldonza why yo no la queria
Traigame mi guia
Get me far from this place
But oh too late, too familiar
Leave me linger with this dark face

[CHORUS]",La Dulcinea,1993
The JudyBats,"Gazing out the window of some big girder bird
Down on mother nature's face, torn-up twisted absurd
I wondered what the chances were that you
Were down there looking up at me

[CHORUS]
Ah, we're as silly as geography
Silly as geography
You and me
We just can't get it right
You're a function of my latitude
Let's end our little warring feud
How I wish you would come home
Or I'll come there to you

[CHORUS]

People will tell you what to do, where your head should be
They don't tell me nothing I ain't already heard before or better said
We all want focus, we crave company but
We're cross-eyed and punchdrunk from too much scenery
From our battles with geography

[CHORUS]

We're a lot like real estate
But the state you're in is never real
It's one helluva rare raw deal
How I wish you would return
We're silly as geography",Geography,1993
The JudyBats,"Incredible bittersweet, I know you well
We're victims of a dual complicity
Villains and heroes, battle scarred and beaming
Taking chances, bought and sold, still scheming
Pretty over the loin, with such a bad disposition
Auctioned off to an eager stranger innocent of the danger
Incredible bittersweet, I know you well
And I've made your apologies, made your apologies
Incredible bittersweet, I could paint you a picture
In black and white, black on white, white on black
But I take it all back...I think I'd just paint it grey
Incredible bittersweet
I know you'd love it anyway
A little tale
Happiness is a hermit that lives on a hill and speaks to no one
Joy is the money that he buries in the yard and forgets where it is
He dies and all the neighbors of the world come digging, finding nothing
But at least they had their little daydream
Incredible bittersweet, I know you well
We're drifters of a grim duality; goodness in evil
Shuffling shards and dealing
All the dances, never sure who's leading
A flipping up of the coin-with such a sick sense of humor
Bluffing illusion of choice in choosing, betting it all and losing
Incredible bittersweet, we've gone to hell
And I make no apologies, make no apologies",Incredible Bittersweet,1993
The JudyBats,"Parceled out like oxygen
Everywhere but very thin
Sampling for sampling's sake
You're an obvious mistake

I love you anyway
You're an intense beige but that's ok
Parceled out like oxygen
Everywhere but very thin
Sampling for sampling's sake
You're an obvious mistake

[Chorus]
Whatcha gonna do when it all comes true
It makes you feel blue and then you get lonely?
You get whatcha want, it makes you feel sad 
And everything you got says sameness only?
Too bad
Sliding in and out of phase
Massing mindless in a maze
Nothing ventured nothing dared
Fake opaque and very scared

Sliding in and out of phase
Massing mindless in a maze
Nothing ventured nothing dared
Fake opaque and very scared

[Chorus]
Talking to yourself it makes it kinda hard, you're always on your guard
Your life is snoring
Fear of extinction keeps you in the yard, you don't go out much anymore
You're so boring!
It's so sad
Barely on the edge of blue
Cheesy channel nothing new
Super square and squeeky clean
Happy little hygiene queen

[Chorus]
Whatcha gonna do when it all comes true
It makes you feel blue and then you get lonely?
You get whatcha want, it makes you feel sad
And everything you got says sameness only?
Too bad...so shut up!

The JudyBats,"There were fireflies keeping the moon company
I was listening to Ricky Lee, some song about sad young men
CHORUS
A chainsaw buzzed when I died
I cried seven minutes for you, seven long drawn sixty-second sobs
Grief, a simple thing; add water to the sorrow and wait
Darkness precipitate, ruin my room and wet my face
CHORUS
Is it really funny how time flies by?
You'd know that better than I, my dead friend
Stepping out the door, through the trees
A single light
ANd I heard the sound, some greatness crashing down over the rise
CHORUS
Is it really funny how time flies by?
You'd know better than I, my dead friend
Ice skating in an hour glass, waiting for it all to pas
My dead friend

The JudyBats,"Pain makes you beautiful
I give you what you want, the pain and the pleasure
I'm no good for you
But then you're no good for yourself
I bring you pain
Pain makes you beautiful
I'm no good for you
You're no good for yourself
Strange and it's wonderful
How you tell me what you need, the joy and the treasure
Of pain's guilty pleasure
Love's pressure painfully
No sorrow tied
Tied to my hurting you
We delight in every torture I put you through
How did we find this place
This state where we satiate, where pain makes you beautiful
Where you're no good for yourself
No sorrow tied
Tied to my hurting you
To the compromising position, to all the painful things I do
Pain makes you beautiful
I give you what you want, the pain and the pleasure
I'm no good for you, but then you're no good for youself",Pain (Makes You Beautiful),1993
The JudyBats,"Falling like leaves from porcelain trees
We break
Shattered by the weight of the fall
Love is Scarlett down the stairs
Pushed or fallen, fallen or shoved
Arching in the air, promised or poisoned
But always loved
Despair versus desire
This game
What loss, what gain?
Whose fault?
Where to blame?
Everything you say to me
Strikes me like a warm disease
Damage is a luxury
Dereliction by degrees
Everything you say to me
Damage is a luxury
Dereliction by degrees
What attracts excites us to the point of distraction- to the edge of dislike
Everything you say to me
Strikes me like a warm disease
Danger is a luxury
Drown me in your darling seas
Saw a horse the other day with one eye and I thought
How nice to see only one side of it all
Love is Scarlett down the stairs
Pushed or fallen, fallen or shoved
Arching through the air, promised or poisoned
But always loved",Scarlett,1993
The JudyBats,"I could kick myself for leaving you
But then I guess I already have at least a thousand times
Ah, this endless parade of mimes
Lonely hearts and fools who want to put themselves off
On anyone as a piece of sun
A ray of light in every seedy starless night
I could kill myself for loving you
But then everyone knows I will if I go out tonight
Ah, the hateful eyes of hindsight
Haunting how-it-will-be's
I'm gonna wrap myself around some young thing like a piece of string
A ball of twine
Like sunshine
I fell for you
And I'm still falling
when I hit the bottom, I will bounce back up
You trip me up
I could kick myself for leaving you
But then I guess I already have at least a thousand times
I fell for you
And I'm still falling
When I hit the bottom, will I bounce back up
You trip me up
I fell for you, and I'm still falling",Trip Me Up,1993
The JudyBats,"It's like I keep you from myself
Like I keep you from everyone else
Everyone needs their mystery
Something hidden, something free

[Chorus]
You're pure light pure delight pure delight
You're pure light pure delight pure delight
You're pure light pure delight pure delight

You're so pure
Now I been out to Hollywood
Them empty people they're no good
Their pretty faces hold a silver scream
But pretty don't mean much to me

[Chorus]
So sweet
Pretty on the inside
Some fright
You're ugly on the outside
I guess we won't be holding hands
Like hallmark lovers on the sands
Who needs the beaches anyway
Stuff my friends and all they'd say

[Chorus]
Pure light
Shining on the inside
I love groovin' on your backside
Yeah, you step up to the microphone
And lotsa people want to take you home
But you don't even like the way I sing
Baby I think that's the sweetes thing

[Chorus]",Ugly on the Outside,1993
The JudyBats,"There's a gentle artifice to loving
That to it all we gently bring
You know, I learned how to kiss you
Watching old movies starring James Dean
And the candles we light
For atmosphere are mostly made in Tokyo or Taiwan
Sometimes I think I love you most when you're off somewhere gone

[CHORUS]
These things take patience
And good taste
And a taste for wasting time
I love you wasting mine
You fill the empty hours just fine
You know you ask for the moon, they bring you these dying stars
A thousand points of blight
A million unmade beds like fading smiles
At least they brighten up the night for a little while
A story of too much too soon and not enough
Later, already begun to hate her
I've seen it all before
We take want and the rest we need
It leaves us clamoring for more and more and more

[CHORUS]

Just wait till now becomes then
You'll see how happy we were
You'll concur
You'll agree
You'll see
Listen to me
In the candlelight, tonight's atmosphere
You look kinda like a movie star, it's true
And I gotta pinch myself to make sure you're still here
You're my favorite thing, my favorite thing to do",Wasting Time,1993
The JudyBats,"Hearts cannot be broken, they're small squishy things
They don't break like glass but they bruise easily
This one you bruise
Words will not be spoken never knowing what they mean
Sticks and stones hurt my bones, your promises have broken me
Each one you break

[Chorus:]
And I want to be good but good is being simple
Simple is forgetting
I simply can't forget
I want to be good but good is being simple

Simple is forgetting
And I simply can't forget
Eyes are always open even when they sleep
Mine are mostly closed while yours are wandering
You look where you please

[Chorus]

I want to be great but greatness is giving
Giving leaves me empty
Oh great emptiness
Souls cannot be taken, they're large and they're loud
Yours merely whispers lately; seems it's shrinkin'
I wish it would speak

I want to be great but greatness is giving
Giving leaves me empty
Oh great emptiness",Being Simple,1994

Howdy do motherfuckers, it's Weezy Baby
Niggas bitchin' and I gotta tote the cannon
Listen close I got duct tape and rope
I'll leave you missin' like the fuckin' O'Bannons
One hand on my money, on hand on my buddy
That's the A-K forty seven made his neighborhood love me
Bullets like birds you can hear them bitches hummin'
Don't let that bird shit, he got a weak stomach
Niggas know I'm sick I don't spit I vomit
Got it?
One egg short of the omelet
Simon says, shoot a nigga in his thigh and leg
And tell him catch up like mayonnaise, um
I'm the sickest nigga doin' it
Bet that baby
These other niggas dough I'm wet crack baby, yes
Get back get back boy this a set back
Clumsy ass niggas slip and fall into a death trap
Them boys pussy, born without a backbone
And if you strapped we can trade like the Dow Jones
Wet him up, I hope he got his towel on
I aim at the moon, and get my howl on
Some niggas cry wolf, I'm on that dry kush
And when it comes to that paper I stack books
You heard what I said
I can put you on your feet 
Or put some money on your head
Life ain't cheap
You're better off dead
If you can't pay the fee
Shout out my nigga fee
See every mother fucker at the door don't get a key
You outside lookin' in, so tell me what you see
Its about money its bigger than me
I told my homies don't kill him bring the nigga to me, yea
Don't miss, you fuckin' with the hit man
Kidnap a nigga make him feel like a kid again

Blowin' game by the quarter weed over in the Rover nigga

From Philly to where I'm landin I'm a cannon
And I'm on that Philly fire shit

You try me get bodied keep the shawty in the whip
If a nigga try to stick me I'm a blam him
Sing a long da da da di I'm free got the butters 
Got the green and got the tan got the whole enchilada

Tie up your brother
Make the prick call up your mother 
She might know where to find you
I am, on top of my job
The heavyweight champ of the flow
Its flow like the ocean, open water you drownin'
I will, four pond 'em 
And sink them heat 'em and leave 'em stinkin'
Sharks surround them and eat them nice then know that I will
Roll over ya squad like I'm a one punch card
You chumps, you best call General Motors
I will, take control of your soldiers
You wont listen till I toss them in the wok like chicken
General toaster

This rap shit like diggin' in the register, dealin' with big embezzlers
Get it right, I'm better and better than my competitors
Ahead, another level up, me, I'm worth eleven plugs
I can stop rappin', ain't I already said enough?
The whole motherfuckin' game owe me, time to settle up
If I move forward a little slower, you'll be catching up
Man that's the shit you need to listen for
'Cause where I'm from niggas dumb, they'll give you what you're itching for
It's a issue with you, best to handle your business, bro
'Cause ain't no politicking when killas comin' to get you, bro
Hey, although, they don't know the whole fire
In the dark, shoot sparks like rim with no tire
I don't deal with the lames, I'd much rather blow by ya
They known to spit a lot of hot air like blow dryers
And I'm really off the wire, look at me, I'm on fire
Here's some useful information if you don't know sire
Snort that cake (cake), and I'm not fake (fake)
So you should strongly consider doin' an about-face

Hold everything dear, in your hand. In a moment it's gone, everything that you love disappears. Hold everything close, 'cause you may outlast it. Memories are all that remain of the way that it was. Watch it all go by, 'cause it's all that you can do. Everything changes so fast. For better or for worse, it was never up to you. Everything's changing so fast. Hold everything in.

You're a mess. It took years to attain and a second to tear it all down. Burn everything off, 'cause the feeling won't last. Memories are all that remain of the way that it was. Watch it all go by, 'cause it's all that you can do. Everything changes so fast. For better or for worse, it was never up to you. Everything's changing so fast. It's changing now. Listen, every single second counts. Every single moment leads up to now. This is the end of their life. This is the end of your life. This is the end of our life. This is the end of my life.

She was walking down the street so I said ""Hello
I'm Kangol from UTFO."" And she said ""So?""
And I said ""So?!? Baby don't you know?
I can sing, rap, and dance in just one show
Cause I'm Kangol, Mr. Sophisticata
As far as I'm concerned ain't nobody greater
From beginning to end and, to beginning
I never lose because I'm all about winning
But if I were to lose, I wouldn't be upset
Cause I'm not a gambler, I don't bet
I don't be in no casino, and baby while you knizzow
The izzi is the grizzeat Kizzangizzo.""
I thought she'd be impress by my devious rap
I thought I had her caught cause I'm a sinister trap
I thought it'd be a piece of cake but it was nothing like that
I guess that's what I get for thinking, ain't that right, black?
Then crizzi to gizzone and seen number izzone
Crizzin ricking tizza of mizzac mic dizza
With the bang bang, brother I feel bad
But I ain't comitting suicide for no crab
But calling her a crab is just a figure of speech
Cause she's an apple, a pear, a plum, and a peach
I thought I had it in the palm of my hand
But man oh man, if I was grand I'd bang Roxanne

Roxanne, Roxanne, can't you understand?
Roxanne, Roxanne, I wanna be your man

Yo Kangol, I don't think that you're dense
Buy you went about the matter with no experience
You should know, she doesn't need a guy like you
She needs a guy like me, with a high IQ
And she'll take to my rap, cause my rap's the best
The educated rapper MD will never fess
So when I met her, I wasted no time
But stuck up Roxanne paid me no mind
She thought my name was Barry, I told her it was Gary
She said she didn't like it so she chose to call me Barry
She said she'd love to marry, my baby she would carry
And if she had a baby, she'd name the baby Harry
Her mother's name is Baby, which is really quite contrary
Her face is really hairy, and you can say it's scary
So isn't not every, her father's a fairy
His job is secondary, in some military
He throws them to an ?electric camp? that wasn't voluntary
His daughter's name is Sherry, his sons are Tom and Jerry
Jerry had the flu but it was only temporary
Back in January, or was it February?
But everytime I say this rhyme it makes me kinda weary
It's only customary to give this commentary
Some say it's bad, some say it's legendary
You can search all you want, try your local library
You'll never find a rhyme like this in any dictionary
But do you know, after all that
All I received was a pat on the back
That's what you get, it happened to me
Ain't that right Mixmaster I-C-E

Roxanne, Roxanne, can't you understand?
Roxanne, Roxanne, I wanna be your man

You thought you had a rose, you thought you was Cupid
But EMD, your rap was plain stupid
I know you're educated, but when will you learn?
Not all girls want to be involved with bookworms
You gotta be strong in a way she can't resist
So educated rapper, huh, bust this...
Since she's a new girl on the block
I had to let her know that I'm the debonoir Doc
I said ""I'd like to speak to you if I can
And if I'm correct your name is Roxanne.""
She said ""How'd you know my name?"" I said ""It's getting around
Right now baby you're the talk of the town
Please let me walk you to the corner, my rap will be brief.""
She said ""I've seen you before, you look like a thief.""
I said ""Me? The Doc? A hood, a rock?
Running around the street robbing people on the block?
Nah, that's not my style, that crime I'm not related
As far as I'm concerned I'm too sophisticated.""
Then it seemed I got busy cause she cracked a smile
That let me know my rap was worth her while
She said ""You call yourself a doctor?"" I said ""This is true.""
She said ""Explain to me really what doctors must do.""
I said ""This is very rare because I don't say this every day
There's a million medical skills a doctor displays
Dermatology is treatment of the skin
Infected and you'll see me and you'll know you're again
There's enthesiology, opthomology
Internal medicine and plastic surgery
Orpedic surgery and pathology
A disease involves a change of the body.""
She said ""Ooooh, that's very unique.""

And so I face the final curtain
My friend, I'll say it clear
I'll state my case, of which I'm certain

I've lived a life that's full
I've traveled each and every highway
Oh, and more, much more than this
I did it my way

Regrets, I've had a few
But then again, too few to mention
I did what I had to do
And saw it through without exemption

I planned each charted course
Each careful step along the byway
But more, much more than this
I did it my way

Yes, there were times, I'm sure you knew
When I bit off more than I could chew
But through it all, when there was doubt
I ate it up and spit it out
I faced it all and I stood tall
And did it my way

I've loved, I've laughed and cried
Had my fill, my share of losing
And now, as tears subside
I find it all so amusing

To think I did all that
And may I say, not in a shy way
""Oh no, oh no not me
I did it my way""

For what is a man, what has he got?
If not himself, then he has naught

Seems somehow sadly gay 
The glory that was Rome 
Is of another day 
IÂ´ve been terribly alone and forgotten in Manhattan 
IÂ´m going home to my city by the bay.

High on a hill, it calls to me. 
To be where little cable cars 
Climb halfway to the stars!

I donÂ´t care!

If you look inside your heart
You don't have to be afraid
Of what you are
There's an answer
If you reach into your soul
And the sorrow that you know
Will melt away

And then a hero comes along
With the strength to carry on
And you cast your fears aside
And you know you can survive
So when you feel like hope is gone
Look inside you and be strong
And you'll finally see the truth
That a hero lies in you

It's a long road
When you face the world alone
No one reaches out a hand
For you to hold
You can find love
If you search within yourself
And the emptiness you felt
Will disappear

Dreams are hard to follow
But don't let anyone
Tear them away
Hold on
There will be tomorrow
In time
You'll find the way

With the strength to carry on
And you cast your fears aside

Sometimes the greatest of miracles
Come from the smallest of things
They knew when they knelt there beside him
They were looking in the eyes of the king.
And that his tiny little fingers would bring us together
For ever and ever, pretty little baby child.

Wonder of wonders, there in the darkness
The light of the promise, how it shines from his eyes
The angels were singing the hallelujah chorus
To the savior before us. Pretty little baby child.

On a one-horse open sleigh,

Laughing all the way;
Bells on bob-tail ring,
Making spirits bright,

A sleighing song tonight
Jingle bells, jingle bells,
Jingle all the way!
O what fun it is to ride
In a one-horse open sleigh

A day or two ago,
I thought I'd take a ride,
And soon miss fanny bright
Was seated by my side;
The horse was lean and lank;
Misfortune seemed his lot;
He got into a drifted bank,
And we, we got upsot.

In a one-horse open sleigh.

A day or two ago,
The story I must tell
I went out on the snow
And on my back I fell;

In a one-horse open sleigh,

I sprawling lie,
But quickly drove away.
Jingle bells, jingle bells,
Jingle all the way!
What fun it is to ride
In a one-horse open sleigh.

Now the ground is white
Go it while you're young,
Take the girls tonight
And sing this sleighing song;
Just get a bob-tailed bay

Hitch him to an open sleigh
And crack! you'll take the lead.

I can still remember how
That music used to make me smile
And I knew if I had my chance
That I could make those people dance
And maybe they'd be happy for a while

But February made me shiver
With every paper I'd deliver
Bad news on the doorstep
I couldn't take one more step

I can't remember if I cried
When I read about his widowed bride
Something touched me deep inside
The day the music died
So

Bye, bye Miss American Pie
Drove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry
And them good ole boys were drinking whiskey and rye
Singin' this'll be the day that I die
This'll be the day that I die

Did you write the book of love
And do you have faith in God above
If the Bible tells you so?
Do you believe in rock and roll?
Can music save your mortal soul?
And can you teach me how to dance real slow?

Well, I know that you're in love with him
'Cause I saw you dancin' in the gym
You both kicked off your shoes
Man, I dig those rhythm and blues

I was a lonely teenage broncin' buck
With a pink carnation and a pickup truck
But I knew I was out of luck

Now, for ten years we've been on our own
And moss grows fat on a rolling stone
But, that's not how it used to be

When the jester sang for the king and queen
In a coat he borrowed from James Dean
And a voice that came from you and me

Oh and while the king was looking down
The jester stole his thorny crown
The courtroom was adjourned
No verdict was returned

And while Lennon read a book on Marx
The quartet practiced in the park
And we sang dirges in the dark
The day the music died
We were singin'

Bye, bye Miss American Pie
Drove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry
Them good ole boys were drinking whiskey and rye
And singin' this'll be the day that I die

Helter skelter in a summer swelter
The birds flew off with a fallout shelter
Eight miles high and falling fast

It landed foul on the grass
The players tried for a forward pass
With the jester on the sidelines in a cast

Now the half-time air was sweet perfume
While sergeants played a marching tune
We all got up to dance
Oh, but we never got the chance

'Cause the players tried to take the field
The marching band refused to yield
Do you recall what was revealed
The day the music died?
We started singin'

Drove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry
Them good ole boys were drinking whiskey and rye
And singin' this'll be the day that I die

Oh, and there we were all in one place
A generation lost in space
With no time left to start again

So come on Jack be nimble, Jack be quick
Jack Flash sat on a candlestick
'Cause fire is the devil's only friend

Oh and as I watched him on the stage
My hands were clenched in fists of rage
No angel born in Hell
Could break that Satan's spell

And as the flames climbed high into the night
To light the sacrificial rite
I saw Satan laughing with delight
The day the music died
He was singin'

I met a girl who sang the blues
And I asked her for some happy news
But she just smiled and turned away

I went down to the sacred store
Where I'd heard the music years before
But the man there said the music wouldn't play

And in the streets the children screamed
The lovers cried, and the poets dreamed
But not a word was spoken
The church bells all were broken

And the three men I admire most
The Father, Son, and the Holy Ghost
They caught the last train for the coast
The day the music died
And they were singing

Can you hear the language of love?
Can we walk together
The winding road up to the rising sun?

Was a time when we could only see
Waves of grain from sea to shining sea
Now the world is smaller, but our dreams
Are larger than they used to be

Come on and stand, come on now, stand
Come on and stand, plant your sword in the sand
In this age of unreason
There's a time and a season for love, stand
I know you can

Like a pilgrim traveling in disguise
I searched for God, I found it in your eyes
Now, I know there is a place
Where sweet compassion never dies

It's between the darkness and the light
In the deepest stillness of the night
There's a fire that burns
Where hearts will find their wings and take to flight

Come on and stand, come on now, stand
Come on and stand, plant your sword in the sand
In this age of unreason
There's a time and a season for love, stand
If you feel love, stand

where I thought I'd be

the darkness
Dig the well deeper than it needs to go
Always been ready to roll where it 
takes me
Anywhere the wind blows

shifting sand
Search, search for a drink that 
wouldn't kill a drowning man
And every step I take
Every choice I make
I'm that much further 'round the bend
I don't wave goodbye, 
there's not need to cry
That's how I go

And I won't dry your tears
You can wonder why
But I'll be far from here

if I live long enough
I just might pass this way again

I said, ""You must be crazy, I got nothing left
She took it all, y'all""

I'm back at it
She loves this song
So I blast it
Dad gets home
I hide in the cabinet
Flip my switch
Like gymnastics
Uh and Imma always be there for you
You just gotta find my plug
I'll be right here waiting for you in the middle of these speakers
If you ever wanna find my love
So

So turn me on
You set me free
Just look inside your speakers
And there you'll see me
So turn me on
You can set me free
Just look inside your speakers
And there you'll find me
There you'll find me

Uh, and she gets older
But I stay the same
And as she grows up
Her opinions change
Now she's off at college
W- are the ones like me
I just hope that one day she'll come back
To hear another song from me
But till then
I just sit in her room and collect dust
Thinkin about us
Waitin for the day she'll push my buttons
And I feel her touch
And get that rush
But I'm not what she needs
So I power down
Then right at that moment
I was found
Hello, her little sister walked in
Knew it was love at first sight
Caught a little twinkle in her eye when I made a sound
She snuck back in the same night
And even though she knows that she wasn't allowed
I know all she wanna do is be near me
One thing is that I felt the same
Wanna tell her but she can't hear me
So I said

So turn me on
You set me free
Just look inside your speakers
And there you'll see me
So turn me on
You can set me free
Just look inside your speakers
And there you'll find me
There you'll find me

Well I woke up Christmas morning and what did I see?
I saw a lovely señorita looking back at me
Named Guadalupe, with big brown eyes
Boy what did you do this time?

Made my excuses and a beeline for the bedroom door
She was beggin' and a-pleadin', screamin', ""Por favor,
Mi cumpleaños, stay with me,
Baby it's cold outside""

She gave me coffee and tortillas to console my head
Prepared the slippers on my feet before she made our bed
And blew the candles from her favourite cake
And we kissed beneath the mistletoe

I pulled her body close to mine and I had just one chance
I whispered, ""Baby will you marry me for just one dance?""
Infatuation, the things you say
I got scared and I left that night

Bearing gifts from my... my Mexican angel

She haunts the early morning hours of December dreams

On the sea

Always here, always on time
Close call, was it love or was it just easy
Money talks when people need shoes and socks,
Steady boys, I'm thinking she needs me

I was just sipping on something sweet
I don?t need political process

I got this feeling that they're gonna break down the door
I got this feeling they they're gonna come back for more
See I was thinking that I lost my mind
But it's been getting to me all this time
And it don't stop dragging me down

Silently reflection turns my world to stone
Patiently correction leaves us all alone
And sometimes I'm a travel man
But tonight this engine's failing

I still hear the children playing

Kick the can, kick the can, skip and blackjack
Steal a car and ring a round-rosy,
Rock and roll, candyland, bogeyman,

Run away and give me your sneakers

Acid rain, when Abel looked up at Cain
We began the weeping and wailing
A hurried high from pestilence pills and pride,
It's a shame, we could have gone sailing
But heaven knows,
Heaven knows everything
Tranquilize

I got this feeling that they're gonna break down the door

Dead beat dancers come to us and stay

Cause I don't care where you've been
And I don't care what you've seen

Hidden under his eyes
But she's an angel for sure
She just can't stop telling lies
But it's too late for his love
Already caught in a trap
His angel's kiss was a joke
And she is not coming back

Because heaven sends and heaven takes
Crashing cars in his brain
Keep him tied up to a dream
And only she can set him free
And then he says to me

Kill me now, kill me now, kill me now, kill me now
Kill me now, kill me now, kill me now, kill me now

Yeah she's got a criminal mind
He's got a reason to pray
His life is under the gun
He's got to hold every day

Now he just wants to wake up
Yeah, just to prove it's a dream
Cause she's an angel for sure
But that remains to be seen

Because heaven sends and heaven takes
Crashing cars in his brain
Keep him tied up to a dream
And only she can set him free
And then he says to me

Kill me now, kill me now, kill me now, kill me now
Kill me now, kill me now, kill me now, kill me now

Stupid on the streets of London
James Dean in the rain
Without her it's not the same
The same, the same, but it's alright

Because heaven sends and heaven takes
Crashing cars in his brain

The robots awake to find that they've been taped down
Wondering when they break though these chains
But little boys have action toys for brains

I'm living proof, it can last a long time, now the girls up
The street are innocent and sweet while their all in bed
They got their makeup and dreams of wonderland

Sprinkled inside their heads soon they will change
But tonight Hollywood hills never seem so strange
Their mothers pray it will last a long time

I wanna roll around like a kid in the snow
I wanna relearn what I already know
Just let me take flight dressed in red
Through the night on a great big sled
I wanna wish you merry Christmas
Ho, ho, ho

Now the boys are all grown up
And there working their fingers to the bone
They go around chasing them girls on the weekend
You know they still can't be alone

I've been raking my brain
With thoughts of peace and love
How on earth did we get so mixed up
I pray to God, it don't last a long time

I wanna roll around like a kid in the snow
I wanna relearn what I already know
Just let me take flight dressed in red
Through the night on a great big sled

I hear the sound of bells
There's something on the roof
I wonder what this night will bring

I wanna roll around like a kid in the snow
I wanna relearn what I already know
Just let me take flight dressed in red
Through the night on a great big sled

I gotta tell ya
I'll make it better

When I was out, though
Maybe you were better alone
I know I'll make it home

She told me sweet thang
Run a labour
In your shoes
Touch me til I follow in love
I wanna help her
Maybe we were better alone

The Killers,"Lift me up on my honour
Take me over this spell
Get this weight of my shoulder
I carried it well
Loose these shackles of pressure
Shake me out of these chains
Lead me not to temptation
Hold my hand harder
Ease my mind
Roll down the smokescreen
And open the sky

Let me fly
Then I need a release from
These troubles of mine
Fix my feet
When they're stumbling
And well you know it hurts sometimes
You know it's going to bleed sometimes

Dig me out from this thorn tree
Help me bury my shame
Keep my eyes from the fire
They can't handle the flame
They've cut out from my brothers
When most of them fail
I carried it well

Let me fly
Then I need a release from
These troubles of mine
Fix my feet
When they're stumbling
I guess you know it hurts sometimes
You know it's going to bleed sometimes

Now hold on
I'm not looking for sweet talk
I'm looking for time
Time for towering sweet folk
Brother 'cause it hurts sometimes
You know it's going to bleed sometimes
Hold on

You know it's going to hurt sometimes
When you call me

Hold on
Hold on
Hold on

I'm going to climb that symphony home
And make it mine
And this pleasure is mine

The Killers,"Time it tells living in my home town,
Wedding bells they begin easy
Live it down, baby don't talk that much,
Baby knows, but baby don't tease me
In the park we could go walking,
Drowned in the dark or we could go sailing
On the sea

Always here, always on time
Close call, was it love or was it just easy
Money talks when people need shoes and socks,
Steady boys, I'm thinking she needs me

I was just sipping on something sweet
I don?t need political process

I got this feeling that they're gonna break down the door
I got this feeling they they're gonna come back for more
See I was thinking that I lost my mind
But it's been getting to me all this time
And it don't stop dragging me down

Silently reflection turns my world to stone
Patiently correction leaves us all alone
And sometimes I'm a travel man
But tonight this engine's failing

I still hear the children playing

Kick the can, kick the can, skip and blackjack
Steal a car and ring a round-rosy,
Rock and roll, candyland, bogeyman,

Run away and give me your sneakers

Acid rain, when Abel looked up at Cain
We began the weeping and wailing
A hurried high from pestilence pills and pride,
It's a shame, we could have gone sailing
But heaven knows,
Heaven knows everything

I got this feeling that they're gonna break down the door
I got this feeling they they're gonna come back for more

Silently reflection turns my world to stone
Patiently correction leaves us all alone
And sometimes I'm travel man
But tonight this engine's failing

I still hear the children playing
Dead beat dancers come to us and stay

Cause I don't care where you've been
And I don't care what you've seen
We're the ones who still believe
And we're looking for a page
In that lifeless book of hope
Where a dream might help you cope
With the Bushes and the bombs

The Killers,"Dustland fairytale beginning
Just another white trash
County kiss
Sixty one
Long brown hair and foolish eyes
He looks just like you want him to
Some kind of slick chrome American prince
A blue jean serenade
And Moon River what'd you do to me
And I don't believe you

Saw Cinderella in a party dress but
She was looking for a night gown
I saw the devil warping up his hands
He's getting ready for the show down
I saw the minute that I turn away
I got my money on a pond tonight

Change came in disguised of revelation
Set his soul on fire
She said she'd always knew he'd come around
And the decades disappear like sinking
Ships we persevere god gives us hope
But we still fear
We don't know
The mind is poison castle in the sky
Sit stranded vandalized
The draw bridge is closing

Saw Cinderella in a party dress but
She was looking for a night gown
I saw the devil warping up his hands
He's getting ready for the show down
I saw the ending were they turned the page
I threw my money and I ran away
Strait to the Vally of the great divide

And were the dreams roll high
And were the wind don't blow
Out here the good girls die
And the sky won't snow
Out here the bird don't sing
Out here the field don't grow
Out here the bell don't ring
Out here the bell don't ring
Out here the good girls die

Now Cinderella don't you go to sleep
Its such a bitter form of refuge
Ah don't you know the kingdoms under siege
And everybody needs you
Is there still magic in the midnight sun
Or did you leave it back in sixty-one
In the of the cadence in the young mans eyes
And were the dreams roll high",A Dustland Fairytale,2008

Wrap your arms around me

Stumble in the twilight
And fell onto the floor

Dreaming of the free world
Lipstick on the nightstand
And demons at the door

Lose the will to go

My head grew heavy and my sight grew dim
I had to stop for the night

There she stood in the doorway
I heard the mission bell
And I was thinking to myself
'This could be heaven or this could be Hell
Then she lit up a candle and she showed me the way
There were voices down the corridor
I thought I heard them say

Welcome to the Hotel California
Such a lovely place (such a lovely place)
Such a lovely face
Plenty of room at the Hotel California
Any time of year (any time of year) you can find it here

Her mind is Tiffany-twisted, she got the Mercedes bends
She got a lot of pretty, pretty boys, that she calls friends
How they dance in the courtyard, sweet summer sweat
Some dance to remember, some dance to forget

So I called up the Captain
'Please bring me my wine
He said, ""we haven't had that spirit here since nineteen sixty-nine
And still those voices are calling from far away
Wake you up in the middle of the night

Such a lovely place (such a lovely place)
Such a lovely face
They livin' it up at the Hotel California
What a nice surprise (what a nice surprise), bring your alibis

Mirrors on the ceiling
The pink champagne on ice
And she said, 'we are all just prisoners here, of our own device
And in the master's chambers
They gathered for the feast
They stab it with their steely knives
But they just can't kill the beast

Last thing I remember, I was
Running for the door
I had to find the passage back to the place I was before

But you can never leave!",Hotel California,2009

When the call came down the line

I was broad but I was kind

Close your eyes
Clear your heart

Cut the cord

Are we human?
Or are we dancer?
My sign is vital
My hands are cold
And I'm on my knees
Looking for the answer
Are we human?
Or are we dancer?

Send my condolences to good
Give my regards to soul and romance
They always did the best they could
And so long to devotion
You taught me everything I know
Wave goodbye
Wish me well

You got to let me go

When you dream of home tonight?
There is no message we're receiving
Let me know is your heart still beating?

Where people on the pen pull the trigger for accolades
I took a bullet and I looked inside it
Running through my veins an American masquerade

I still remember grandma Dixie's wake
I've never really known anybody to die before
Red, white and blue upon a birthday cake
My brother, he was born on the fourth of the July and that's all

In the shadowplay acting out your own death, knowing no more

Next thing I knew they ripped me from my bed,

That I could leave this star-crossed world behind,
But when they cut me open,
I guess that changed my mind.
And you know I might
Have just flown too far from the floor this time,
Cause they calling me by my name
And the zipping white light beams
Disregards the bombs and satellites

You better look it over,
Before you make that leap

They justify my claim,
And the public don't dwell my transmission
Cause it wasn't televised

On Saturday nights.

For just one more.

A million miles of freedom, a million miles of road,

She wrote her number down
And she gave it to me
They had to scrape me off the floor
In this transient town, waiters and dealers
Trying to get their foot in the door

That night I called her and she said
""Daddy daddy daddy, all my life
I've been trying to find my place in the world""
And I said to her
""Baby baby babe, I got all night to listen to the heart of a girl""

I can see the time drippin' down the clock,
We've been trying to hear that ancient refrain
It's the one that knows just when our heads are down
And reminds us of the place from where we came
Where we came

""Daddy daddy daddy, all my life
I've been trying to find my place in this world""
""Baby baby babe, I got all night to listen to the heart of a girl""

A ripple in the water
From the drop of a pearl

For the heart of a girl

Staring down the mouth of a hundred thousand guns

Or you can scream it on a microphone
