MGM Orchestra & Chorus,"And the gods beheld that the thunder warriors fought hard and brave in the
""battle of metal"". However, they wanted to challenge them once again. This test
Was called the ""battle of steel"". In order to aid them in their holy quest it
Was decided to bestow unto them four magic utensils.

So the gods called upon the old dwarf and the mighty wizard and told them what
They sought. The dwarf took the sword Nothung, once belonging to ""Siegfried
The dragon-slayer"", fused and smithed from it's steel four shakels of metal.
The wizard created the same number of amulets from the skin of a black demon.
He then took the silver shaded blood of a dead unicorn from which he drew four
Magic runes, each drenched with natural power.

The power and strength of a bear would be given to the bearer of the hammer
""giants death"", the speed of a hunting hawk to the bearer of the bow ""heart
Hunter"", the brutality of a lone wolf to the bearer of the axe skullcrusher,
And the deafening roar of a black lion to the bearer of the sword souleater.
Then the dwarf mounted the shakels of metal on the amulets whilst reciting
Ancient words of magic power. Thereafter the amulets were presented to the
Dragon lords, who brought them to midgard, home of the thunder warriors. They
Received this gift and a mighty power flushed through their veins. It was the
Power of magic-the magic of steel.

Suddenly thunder rocked the silence, lightning crushed the roof of the hall,
And the two mightiest gods of Valhalla -Thor and Odin- stood on the stage. The
God of thunder held his hammer on high. Odin wailed his spear into the
Audience. Any wimp present knew now that death was imminent. They disappeared
As quickly as they came.

In the blink of an eye the thunder warriors conquered the stage: Once again they
Would ride side by side with their legion of doom, under the sign of the
Wizard, to their next test- the ""battle of steel""... So they fought with the
Power of metal and again were victorious. They devoured the hearts and spilled
The blood of their enemies. Their weapons found the hearts of all decievers and
Liers, crushing their bodies to the ground. After the ""battle of steel"" was
Over the ground was covered by a sea of blood. From that day on the four
Thunder warriors knew that they were forever bound by metal.",Main Title [From Babes on Broadway],1995
MGM Orchestra & Chorus,"Somewhere over the rainbow, way up high
There's a land that I've heard of once in a lullaby.
Somewhere over the rainbow, skies are blue
And the dreams that you dare to dream,
Really do come true.

Someday I'll wish upon a star
And wake up where the clouds are far behind me.
Where troubles melt like lemon drops,
High above the chimney tops,
That's where you'll find me.

Somewhere over the rainbow, blue birds fly

MGM Studio Chorus,"When Louis came home to the flat,
He hung up his coat and his hat,
He gazed all around, but no wifey he found,
So he said ""where can Flossie be at?""
A note on the table he spied,
He read it just once, then he cried.
It ran, ""Louis dear, it's too slow for for me hear,
So I think I will go for a ride.""

""Meet me in St. Louis, Louis,
Meet me at the fair,
Don't tell me the lights are shining
Any place but there,
We will dance the Hoochee Koochee,
I will be your tootsie wootsie,
If you will meet in St. Louis, Louis,
Meet me at the fair.""

The dresses that hung in the hall,
Were gone, she had taken them all,
She took all his rings and the rest of his things,
The picture he missed from the wall.
""What! Moving!"" the janitor said,
""Your rent is paid three months ahead.""
""What good is the flat?"" said poor Louis, ""Read that.""
And the janitor smiled as he read.

MGM Studio Chorus,"With my high starched-collar and my high-topped shoes
And my hair piled high upon my head
I went to lose a jolly hour on the trolley
And lost my heart instead
With his light brown derby and his bright green tie
He was quite the handsomest of men
I started to yen so I counted to ten 
Then I counted to ten again

Clang, clang, clang went the trolley
Ding, ding, ding went the bell
Zing, zing, zing went my heart strings
From the moment I saw him I fell

Chug, chug, chug went the motor
Bump, bump, bump went the brake
Thump, thump, thump went my heart strings
When he smiled I could feel the car shake

He tipped his hat, and took a seat
He said he hoped he hadn't stepped upon my feet
He asked my name, I held my breath
I couldn't speak because he scared me half to death

Buzz, buzz, buzz went the buzzer
Plop, plop, plop went the wheels
Stop, stop, stop went my heart strings
As he started to go then I started to know how it feels
When the universe reels

The day was bright, the air was sweet
The smell of honeysuckle charmed you off your feet
You tried to sing, but couldn't squeak
In fact you loved him so you couldn't even speak

Buzz, buzz, buzz went the buzzer
Plop, plop, plop went the wheels
Stop, stop, stop went my heart strings
As he started to leave
I took hold of his sleeve with my hand
And as if it were planned
He stayed on with me and it was grand just to stand
With his hand holding mine to the end of the line",The Trolley Song,1957

She can give you a view of the world

MGM Studio Chorus,"A medicine man I met 
Said don't get yourself in a sweat 
When things look gray, 
Just shrug and say: 
""It musta been somethin' I et!"" 
""So don't get yourself in a snit, "" he said, 
""Tuck your tantrums into your kit instead 
""It's disarming to be charming,"" 
Quoth the medicine man, 
Whom all agree it's plain to see 
Nobody could be wiser than 

So if your temper's getting a top hand, 
All you have to do is just stop and 
Pass that peace pipe and bury that hatchet 
Like the Choctaws, Chickasaws, 
Chattahoochee's, Chippewas do 

If you're feeling mad as a wet hen, 
Mad as you can possibly get, then 
Pass that peace pipe, bury that tomahawk 
Like those Chichamecks, Cherokees, 
Chapultepec's do 
That cold shoulder never solved a single complaint 
When you're older, you'll wipe off all of that war paint 

If you find yourself in a fury, 
Be your own judge and your own jury 
Pass that peace pipe and bury that hatchet 
Like the Choctaws, Chickasaws, 
Chattahoochee's, Chippewas do 

If you want to hover out west, too, 
You will soon discover it's best to 
Pass that peace pipe and bury that hatchet 
Like the Choktohs, Changos, 
Chattanooga's, Cheekarohs do 

Even in colonial days, you 
Know the ceremonial ways to 
Pass that peace pipe and bury that tomahawk 
Like those Chakootamees, Chepacheps 
'N' Chicopees, too

When ""all clear""'s in, you'll be top man on the totem pole 

So, if you wanna be an all-right guy 
Not a long face, blues-in-the-night guy 
Write that apology and dispatch it! 
When you quarrel, it's grand to patch it! 
Pass that peace pipe and bury that hatchet

(Butler) The other gentlemen are here. Please come in.
(Reporters) She's new; she's perfection; she's headlines; she's hot! 
And in advance the critics are all in accord - she's gonna win the next academy award. 
All her fans will be delighted, not to mention quite excited at her personal appearance presently. She's stupendious, tremendious, collosical, teriffical, she's got it! But, definitely! The glamorous, amorous lady they call...

I mean, how perfectly marvelous of you to have... 
Well, you have dropped in, haven't you? And I...

(Judy) But, about my next picture - I'm faced with a curious problem. 
Shall I always be dramatic, biographically emphatic? 
Should I devote my life to the legitimate art? 
Or should I do what I'd adore so, do my acting with my torso, and give all the natives a start? 
Must the roles I play be tragic, full of Oscar-winning magic, should I drink the cup of drama to its dregs? Or do you think it is permissible to be for once quite kissable and give them a peep of my leg?
I'd like to be a pinup girl, a cheesecake girl too. 
And what is Ginger Rogers that I am not? 
And what has Betty Grable got that I haven't got?

But, would the episode outlive me, would my public quite forgive me if I tried to show the world I'm really hep?

(Reporters) And so she did!

Now it's number one thanks to Tom the piper's son

Tom, Tom, the piper's son
He stole a tune and away he run
And away run he with that melody

Tom was hot, the tune was sweet
But he revamped it with a new off beat
And the classic thing got a shot of swing

Mr. Brahms cried, argh
So did Mozart and Bach
And to hear them rave
Paganini tumbled over in his grave

And now that tune that no one played
Has stepped right up and hit the hit parade
It was growing pop and it couldn't stop
Now it's number one thanks to Tom the piper's son

Tom, Tom, the piper's son
He stole a tune and away he run
And away run he with that melody

Tom was hot, the tune was sweet
But he vamped it with a boogie beat
And the classic thing got a shot of swing

Beethoven turned gray
So did Debussy and Bose
It was such a stew
Tchaikovsky said, ""I'm gonna sue""

And now that tune that no one played
Has stepped right up and hit the hit parade
It was growing pop and it couldn't stop
Now it's number one thanks to Tom the piper's son

Hello means the birth of a smile
And the smile will erase the tear blighting trace

MGM Studio Chorus,"Paddy Mack drove a hack 
Up and down Broadway, 
Pat had one expression and he'd use it every day; 
Any time he'd grab a fare, to take them for a ride, 
Paddy Jumped upon the seat, cracked his whip and cried.

One fine day on Broadway, 
Pat was driving fast, 
When the street was blown to pieces by a subway blast; 
Down the hole poor Paddy went, a thinkin' of his past, 
Then he says, says he, I think these words will be my last:

First of all, at the call, 
When the war began, 
Pat enlisted in the army as a fighting man; 
When the drills began, they'd walk a hundred miles a day, 
Tho the rest got tired, 
Paddy always used to say:

Where do we go from here boys, 
Where do we go from here? 
Anywhere from Harlem to a Jersey City pier;
When Pat would spy a pretty girl, he'd whisper in her ear, 
""Oh joy, Oh boy, Where do we go from here?""

Where do we go from here boys, 
Where do go from here? 
Paddy's neck was in the wreck 
but still he had nor fear; 
He saw a dead man next to him and whispered in his ear, 
""Oh joy, Oh boy, Where do we go from here?""

Where do we go from here boys, 
Where do we go from here? 
Slip a pill to Kaiser Bill 
and make him shed a tear; 
And when we see the enemy we'll shoot in the rear, 
""Oh joy, Oh boy, 
Where do we go from here?""",Where Do We Go from Here?,1996

If I can't conceal the thrill that I'm feeling,

Ican't help it if that doggoned moon above
Makes me need someone like you to love!

Blame your kiss as sweet as a kiss can be
And blame all your charms that melt in my arms
But don't blame me.

I like every single thing about you
Without a doubt you are like a dream
In my mind I find a picture of us as a team

Ever since the hour of our meeting
I've been repeating a silly phrase
Hoping that you'll understand me one of these days.

MGM Studio Orchestra,"I'm recalling times when I was small, in light and free jubilee days,
Old folks praying everybody swaying,
Loudly, I chanted my praise.
How I sang about the Judgement morn,
And of Gabriel tooting on his horn.
In that sunny land of milk and honey,
I had no complaints,
While I thought of Saints
So I say to all who feel forlorn:

Sing ""Hallelujah! Hallelujah!"" and you'll shoo the blues away:
When cares pursue you, ""Hallelujah!""
Gets you through the darkest day.
Satan lies awaiting and creating skies of grey,
But ""Hallelujah! Hallelujah!""
Helps to shoo the clouds away.",Hallelujah,1955

There may be other springs as full and fare,

MGM Studio Orchestra,"And the gods beheld that the thunder warriors fought hard and brave in the
""battle of metal"". However, they wanted to challenge them once again. This test
Was called the ""battle of steel"". In order to aid them in their holy quest it
Was decided to bestow unto them four magic utensils.

So the gods called upon the old dwarf and the mighty wizard and told them what
They sought. The dwarf took the sword Nothung, once belonging to ""Siegfried
The dragon-slayer"", fused and smithed from it's steel four shakels of metal.
The wizard created the same number of amulets from the skin of a black demon.
He then took the silver shaded blood of a dead unicorn from which he drew four
Magic runes, each drenched with natural power.

The power and strength of a bear would be given to the bearer of the hammer
""giants death"", the speed of a hunting hawk to the bearer of the bow ""heart
Hunter"", the brutality of a lone wolf to the bearer of the axe skullcrusher,
And the deafening roar of a black lion to the bearer of the sword souleater.
Then the dwarf mounted the shakels of metal on the amulets whilst reciting
Ancient words of magic power. Thereafter the amulets were presented to the
Dragon lords, who brought them to midgard, home of the thunder warriors. They
Received this gift and a mighty power flushed through their veins. It was the
Power of magic-the magic of steel.

Suddenly thunder rocked the silence, lightning crushed the roof of the hall,
And the two mightiest gods of Valhalla -Thor and Odin- stood on the stage. The
God of thunder held his hammer on high. Odin wailed his spear into the
Audience. Any wimp present knew now that death was imminent. They disappeared
As quickly as they came.

In the blink of an eye the thunder warriors conquered the stage: Once again they
Would ride side by side with their legion of doom, under the sign of the
Wizard, to their next test- the ""battle of steel""... So they fought with the
Power of metal and again were victorious. They devoured the hearts and spilled
The blood of their enemies. Their weapons found the hearts of all decievers and
Liers, crushing their bodies to the ground. After the ""battle of steel"" was
Over the ground was covered by a sea of blood. From that day on the four
Thunder warriors knew that they were forever bound by metal.",Main Title [From Babes on Broadway],1995

And lost my heart instead
With his light brown derby and his bright green tie
He was quite the handsomest of men
I started to yen so I counted to ten 
Then I counted to ten again

Clang, clang, clang went the trolley
Ding, ding, ding went the bell
Zing, zing, zing went my heart strings
From the moment I saw him I fell

Chug, chug, chug went the motor
Bump, bump, bump went the brake
Thump, thump, thump went my heart strings
When he smiled I could feel the car shake

He tipped his hat, and took a seat
He said he hoped he hadn't stepped upon my feet
He asked my name, I held my breath
I couldn't speak because he scared me half to death

Buzz, buzz, buzz went the buzzer
Plop, plop, plop went the wheels
Stop, stop, stop went my heart strings
As he started to go then I started to know how it feels
When the universe reels

The day was bright, the air was sweet
The smell of honeysuckle charmed you off your feet
You tried to sing, but couldn't squeak
In fact you loved him so you couldn't even speak

Buzz, buzz, buzz went the buzzer
Plop, plop, plop went the wheels
Stop, stop, stop went my heart strings
As he started to leave
I took hold of his sleeve with my hand
And as if it were planned
He stayed on with me and it was grand just to stand
With his hand holding mine to the end of the line",The Trolley Song [From Meet Me in St. Louis],1997

You're Moonlight on a night in Capri,
And Cape Cod looking out at the sea,
You're all places that leave me breathless,
And no wonder: you're all the world to me.

You're Lake Como when dawn is aglow,
You're Sun Valley right after a snow.
A museum, a Persian palace,

Till I see the brightness in every pot and pan
I am sure this point of view will ease the daily grind
So I'll keep repeating in my mind

Look for the silver lining
Whenever a cloud appears in the blue
Remember somewhere the sun is shining
And so the right thing to do is make it shine for you

A heart full of joy and gladness
Will always banish sadness and strife
So always look for the silver lining
And try to find the sunny side of life

So always look for the silver lining
And try to find the sunny side of life

On the face and the hands
On a green colored island
On a primitive man
It was the future reflected
It felt familiar but new
A street was missing a building
The kids had something to do

There was a feeling the spirit was leaving
Red like a marker
So my tribe, with my knife
Cut the heart from a lonely life

I saw patterns on floorboards
Deep in the dust was a leader
Someone was walking on floorboards
Turned them from oak to cedar
He can assess the situation
I wrapped a string around my finger
Into the forest with the young ones
I don't expect to be a winner

But as long as you feel it
I'm a believer
My heart is phosphor
Sea rolls and death tolls
Break the surface don't break my bones

Off of the trail and off of your hands and
Onto a new plan
Is the cost to stay lost
Forever in an empty skin
Pale and thin

If it's good, or if it's fortune, I can't tell
But pieces come together for some reason just as well
Their guns couldn't see us
There's a sea outside my door
And one day I'll appreciate
The rush of blood and the washed out beat of the shore

And remember what it felt like
To be alone

Take everything they can steal

Your fair weather friends on a parachute binge get lost when the wind blows
The handshake's stuck on the tip of my tongue
It tastes like death but it looks like fun

I was a loner
I was just waiting by myself
When you, warped temptress
Rose to bring me happiness and wealth
Black tears, black smile, black credit cards and shoes
You can call all the people you want
But it's you who's being used

Under your black eyes, honey
Right beneath your nose
A curse on all creation
Every single thing you know
White smoke, white light, white marble on the floor
It would only take a few seconds of darkness to figure out what's in store

Might even take a knife to split a hair
Or even scare the children off my lawn

MGMT,"Sleep as the goer
The bridge that watches the light speed through
And cries while the spirit stumbles
The inside missile for the protection of you

Maybe it's silent
The voice can't bear anymore strain
But speaks without even knowing
And streams outside in the direction of truth

There's no reason there's no secrets to decode
If you can't save it, leave it dying on the road
Wide open arms can feel so cold
So cold
Feel so cold

Balance the books, the ledges, the loons
The disappointed look on the faces
That squint at the moon
Let's see it with shadows enhanced
And then vote to decide who'll advance
Silver jet plane, making a turn
Exciting the brain that expects it to crash and then burn
It's not the life lesson I'd've guessed
If you're conscious you must be depressed
Or at least cynical
But someone might still eat the steaks
Even if they're tough
Spending the day
Chewing the fat
Floating away isn't rough but it's not enough
Oh Marianne, pass me the joint
The sandpaper's tan
Go-getters are surfing the point
And London's a scratch on the lens
It's over before it begins
Silk 'round her neck falls down to her shoulders
The older I get, the more I suspect there's a trick
But really there's no trip at all
That doesn't result in a fall
Or a faltering
But something could spit out the bait
Even if it's real
Rolling away
Missing a spoke
Close to the ground like a wheel but it's not a joke
Holding the line
Clutching the phone
Nobly wasting the night, but it isn't right
It's not right
Smelling for blood
Praying for rain
Running away isn't rough, but it's not enough

The low tide is telling me, when it's over,
To breathe in everything exposed
And comes back to cover me with a blanket
Being here's always changing tunes

The empty sky surrounds me but I can't see at all
Wide open arms can feel so cold
And you can sit beside me and tell me what it's
Worth
But I hope I die before I get sold
I hope I die before I get sold
I'd rather die before I get sold

If you find the soul that you lost
Frozen in a starry void
Take it within and hope the sight of blood
Can will signs of life to return
Back to the way that it was
Long before it made a noise
To keep on quietly reminding you
What's never created or destroyed

Wake as the swell peaks
The close-outs drowning the birds with roars
And howls scare the new unkindness
That picks and laughs at the carrion scene

Forces you see breath can always go into hiding
And wait 'til it passes over
Or stay far gone for all eternity",Siberian Breaks,2010

That twitches on a peak at the place where the spirit was slain
One foot leads to another
Night's for sleep, blue curtains, covers
Sequins in the eyes
That's a fine time to dine
Divine who's circling, feeding the cards to the midwives
Who love those alien days
The nonstop alien days
Ooh the alien days

Must've skipped the ship and joined the team
For a ride
A couple hours to learn the controls
And commandeer both my eyes
Hey!
Be quick dear, times are uncertain
One month crawling, next year blurring
Decades in the drain
Monograms on the brain
Decide what's working and what's moved on
To the last phase
The floodgate alien days
I love those alien days
Mmm... the alien days

When the peels are down, it feels like traveling in style
You don't need wings to hover forty ton stones for a mile
And in the summer, virgin visions
Mindless humming
Numbers can't decide if the day's supposed to smile

Today find infinite ways it could be
Plenty worse
It's a blessing but it's also a curse

Those days taught me everything I know
How to catch a feeling
And when to let it go
How all the scheming, soulless creatures
Can't find dreamer's honey in the hive
If it's right beneath the nose

And when the light is new
The sky shows trembling cartoons
You don't need smoke to cover
Most of the world in a gloom
But here comes racer number 7
Watch my fingers ripping out the lines

If it looks like we could lose
If it looks like we could lose
If it looks like we could lose",Alien Days,2013
MGMT,"My green silken river and two lights
I could almost touch the free walls
When we were evicted from the heavens,
Fast clouded-over bumbling eyes
Now peering out through a sinking
Cosmic smile, reversed completely
Flaming currents forced us to surface,
Wet purple gowns and blaring alarms
All for some milky perversion,
Nothing the spooks wouldn't be used to
Spoiled by an empty fear of violence,
The only time I've ever been dropped

The minute the mirror turned its back to me
My distinct conviction of keeping
Eternal sources piled somewhere familiar
Was compromised and tangled in knots
For all I know we were sleeping,
Arranged like Fate's vain infantry,
Stacked in unconscious opposition,
Blind and happy for tomorrow.",Astro-Mancy,2013

Feign like I notice a fundamental tone
The fine pedals open and close offended
More explanation and nothing shown

Kind of like if a friend exits without a sign
Glimmering like a precious stone
Maybe we share the dream for 20 nights in a row
I would feel better knowing that I was alone

Wherever scientists turn lead to birds,
Torment ignites essence, delights from the earth
What you find shocking
They find amusing,
Something else to soften a sadistic urge
When they tell you the extent of the vice
Then the prime time mission is to choke the statistician,
And like the senses that you're lurking behind
While it gnaws right through to your core,
Oh I'd twist it more

If you think that you're free (Free like a kite)
Watching as it flies by (Spy the unknown)
Focus on the quiet oars
Tell me how far you'd go (Go where you like)
Knowing your air won't last (Last one to know)
Would you feel better holding the stars up?

What if the beast escapes (Apes have it good)
And separates like a cloud (Loud like a fault),
Seeps into the hollow bones?
Wouldn't its eyes expand
And zero in like a scope?

Feeding time
Either hemisphere if it's summer there
Seeking you, taking a dive,
Streets realigned

All the fun in the world
From your little heart
And now I owe it back to you
But it's hard to catch it and let it go,
Find excuses to burn right through the grief
And to melt, to melt, to melt

Down to a trace

And you feel it's all right

All beginnings are an end,
In the blackness there’s a light

One or two letters at the most
Shipping crates might line the streets,
Every stranger is a ghost
Cashiers won’t deduct the pain,
Loneliness sleeps on the couch
Only noticing the stain
Once the color’s faded out
Let’s go camping in the cold,
Make a fire, buy a tent
Envision leather getting old,
Re-send pigeons that were sent
Try to memorize your smell,
It reminds me of a field
Crickets clearer than a bell
Have all their guts recast in steel
Birds don’t cry when echoes quit,
They trail off into the fog
Autumn hurts far less than sticks,
Knowing winter’s five feet tall
Generations of defeat
All assuming your the worst
They never tied the cans
To the back end of a hearse
Take your hand against my own,
If there’s a finger I can grip
Reassure me at the ace
Mine’s a black heart you could flip
I’ve come to terms with what I have,
What’s been given, what’s been asked
Turn my back against the sea,
And beg the serpent for a dance
But in the red dirt muddy towns,
Celebration of the dark
Children walking hand in hand
With the pygmies in the park

Time spent sitting all alone
Time spent looking at my phone
Time spent sitting all alone
Time spent looking at my phone

I try to pull the curtains back
Turn you off, can't be touched
When all I want and all I know
Is time spent looking at my phone

(On my phone)

Find me when the lights go down
Signing in signing out
Gods descend to take me home
Find me staring at my phone

I'm wondering where the hours went
As I'm losing consciousness
My sullen face is all aglow
Time spent looking at my phone

Nothing that you need
Is a new shiny feature
All the memories you've shared
Developed by perverted creatures

Nothing can compete
With the first time you saw her
Passing strangers on the street
Spending every moment looking at their phones

(On my phone)

Time spent sitting all alone
Time spent looking at my phone
Time spent sitting all alone
Time spent looking at my phone

I call you, you don't call me back
Almost had a heart attack
I'm listening to the window moan
Time spent looking at my phone

Closer getting far
So you close all the windows
I would never let you die
Even if our love is over winter
You know what you need
Is a way to remember
You can never find the time
If you spend everyday looking at your phone

You should come with me
We can lose ourselves in nothing
Happy faces from the feed
And we try to turn them into something
Even if you choose to believe that it's empty
You come back to me again
You can go ahead and stop pretending",TSLAMP,2018

And troubles seem so far
You put your belly up to the bar
Squint your eyes

You can't walk down the hall
When you're small
You're not very big at all

When you're low
You reach a certain point
Where you can't really see the point
You can try
But you can't see eye to eye

Might just fuck us over

It's time to hand it over

Now we'll see who is who
Look who's bending over

But the stars weren't wrong, the time felt right
We both knew it was true

Oh
Forgiving who you are
For what you stand to gain
Just know that if you hide
It doesn't go away

Knowing what's nearby

Hearing words that I have never heard

I'm as giddy as a baby on a swing

Serai-je un père exemplaire?
Mon gosse j'l'aimerai comme ma mère un peu autoritaire
Mais toujours protecteur je tiens ça de mon père
Je dirai que le savoir est une richesse
Et de ne jamais durer dans le mauvais rêve
Tout ça n'est qu’éphémère
Petit trace ton chemin et laisse tout tes soucis derrière
On n'vit qu'une fois donc on profite, la meilleure équipe c'est la famille
Jamais sûr d’être là demain
Je repense aux perdus j'me rappelle on n'a qu'une vie
Laisse parler les gens c'est la meilleure des réponses

Nos p'tites galères et nos conneries
La vie va nous cher-lâ
Et la même questions ""qu'est-ce que nous réserve l'avenir?""
On rêve d'une grande famille on y parviendra
L'amour de tes parents jamais de la vie tu n'le perdras
Maman ne s'en fait pas, son fils a les épaules larges
Là-haut, on veille sur moi, normal qu'on les oublie pas
On peut pas dire autrement
L'absence d'une mif, ça se ressent

She walked like a turtle with a saw paw

Keep ticking like a brain on a robot

Like he was iced tea, I was always pom more
But you broke me when you act like you want war
Coz my strength makes you feel insecure

Making bombs with rubber bands

I have my hard down

But I put away paper for later so I'm stable
A better something better come
So I could get cable
Ghetto pops, food drops
I store them in my stable
I cook em up, pop em down
Eat me it off ya a table

The village got on the phone
Said the street is comin' to town
They wanna check my papers
See what I carry around
Credentials are boring
I burnt them at the burial ground
Don't order me about
I'm an outlaw from the badland

Voted to organize into higher elements

Forbidden fruit turning to wine. Intoxicating.
Nakedly we lay in an ecstatic embrace, trying not to come too quickly
One minute rise, plastic bagged lubricated safety tube

This is not a through street; one cannot pass here 
But where me and you meet to graze the divine pastures 
This is not a through street; one cannot pass here 
But run and jump with two feet 
And break through all the matter

Throw your body to the edge of crisis 
Paralysis is everywhere 
Throw your body to the edge of crisis

To all the things which bind me to the grave, you came
You came in the morning after a long night
You came in the morning after a dark night

I stared into the knife. to see if it would hurt me
Threaten my life, use me and desert me
To a decision, I came.
I came in the morning after a long night
I came in the morning after a dark night

I took the knife, slid it under my belt
Was so surprised at the joy I felt
To come out of the mourning, I Came

Mia Doi Todd,"I scrub my blackened feet
Scrape off the caked on grime of the street
I wash my hands and face
Of the Worldly soot that accumulate
In the day-in day-out farcical strife
In the humdrum of everyday life
And I enter my home clean
Step up to the hearth I've deemed my own

I sit down on the bidet
And shower my flower of the decay
That sets in when she lets in a guest
For recreation no creation, her slight protest
And I enter my bed clean
Lay down my head and dream of another world

The desert springs to life
The golden chaparral gives up her rights
To poppy fields for miles
And purple lupin lavender behind
Another world

Waking with the sun
The poppy petals peel back to open
And turn the hills orange
To start another cycle of seasons
Another world

We dance as whooping cranes
Who once again have found their lifetime mates
We bound across the plains
Roll down slopes, fill our white coats with stains
Of another world

We come to rest as one
At the bottom of the hill, start to make love
We lean against the earth
Rocking back and forth and back and forth, back and forth
Another world

Under a wild sky setting sun
We ride the waves towards something still to come

And it gave me a lift; appeared the Goodyear blimp.
The tree out your window is covered in pink snow.
You put a few blossoms in the envelope. I didn't know.

I'm confetti of fuschia hearts. We are never really apart.

You dreamed of me the last night of summer.
You dreamed of me the last night of summer.

You were coming. I was leaving. We met in the harbor 
Where whaling ships dock. We threw some rocks.
Everyone wanted you. I was not immune to the fever 
That overtook the cast and crew. I couldn't get to you.
But I had a secret, a torch to give you. I stole an hour 
Or two to share the fruit I grew with you.

A landfill of deceit. The walls are hollow 
And we listen, worry what they will secrete.

Woe woe woe woe is we.

We're junking bonds; we're dropping 
Bombs we've made by guzzling gasoline.

Takes the broken makes them whole
Takes the bound makes them free
Takes the weak and makes them strong
All of my sins been erased
He has lifted my disgrace
I'm overjoyed, overjoyed
That Jesus would make me fall whole

I ain't tryin to be hot just tryin to be relevant
I ain't a candle I ain't trying to wax eloquent
I'm runnin from my life, now I'm tryin to fight hard
These ain't just lyrics but a contrite heart
Yeah, feeling it like the heat in the summer
We know better but the flesh be keeping us running
Back the leeks and onions that's the recent discovered
If it's in the dark it's impossible to keep secrets covered
Who would have known that my indiscretions would reach my cousins
I apologize to Mimi my niece and others
Should have been able to trust but I breached the covenant
I knew you all before you was able to reach the cupboard
Now when I preached in public it's all out the window
Cause sin contradicted a lot of what my pen wrote
Especially when I wrote an open book
Apparently there was something in me I overlooked

[Chorus]
When I was dead, revived my soul
Takes the broken makes them whole
Takes the bound makes them free
Takes the weak and makes them strong
All of my sins been erased
He has lifted my disgrace
I'm overjoyed, overjoyed
That Jesus would make me fall whole

Check my records I got some prize 
They call em nights surprise like Harlem Knights
I need Jesus David's son like a holly Harley bike
Wasn't hardly right what I did was wrong
And it ticks me off and sets me off
And I hate the consequences cause death is
But I know I reap what I sow like Betsy Ross
He ain't tempt me but He let me fall
Now I carry all that pain, sin left me scarred
He let me fall but He ain't let me go
And now I wouldn't stray, sin left me broke
Yeah the life in me ain't no crystal stair
But I keep climbing cause the diamond is crystal clear
At times I'm quiet, I get a chair
Sit and stare think about the ways the sin affected my fiscal year
Yeah the tide is turning now, shifting gears
The weak is given strength in midst of tears

[Chorus]

Felt dead and lonely
Only God knows
That Jesus came to breathe life on my dry bones
I know a lot, knowing a lot's not wrong
But now it's all about application like the iPhone
I got hang-ups like dial tones
Yeah but Jesus hung up and died so
No condemnation, that's my consolation

Am I still guilty? 
Not a conversation
Now I just wanna proclaim it in the congregation
God is good and Doctor Jesus got a lot of patience
I wanna operate and take the heart palpitate
And look at what the bride is shaping
God I thank the body, cause y'all came behind me
When my foot slipped and I sank in the valley
Something supernatural happened when the saints rallied
My true friends held me up like a bank robbery
And that's foolproof, I can't even front like a gold tooth
I hate what I had to go through, 
But I love the fact that I got to know you
So what you are witnessing now is the whole truth

Mia Mark,"Look at you in bed, you're hardly breathin'
I knew it was gonna end this way
I said it all the time, but you said that you were fine
And now you wonder why, and why you
I tried my best to make you check it out, huh?
I cried so much it burnt my eyes, I begged every day
But all the stubborn things you do
I must've gotten that from you
Now there's nothing they can do, and why you?
I wished that there was somethin' I'd done more
Knocked you out and dragged you there myself
Maybe then you'd be here, you'd be here

Tuck my things we've grown up to
And how much I love you every way
But you're not here, and with all my tears
It feels like Monsoon every day

Monsoon

Look into your eyes, do you see me?
Staring into space, you've lost yourself
The rain has fallen through, and there's nothing I can do
But just cry all over you, and why you?
Play our favorite songs, do you hear them?
Take us back to times so happy, with good health
Traveling galore, just the two of us in store
And the plans we had for more, and why you?
Never thought that there would be an ending
Father loved strong enough to make you stay
If it was, if it was
You'd be here, you'd be here

Tuck my things we've grown up to
And how much I love you every way
But you're not here, with all my tears
It feels like Monsoon every day

Halo halo halo

Mia Martini,"E' un'incognita ogni sera mia...
Un'attesa, pari a un'agonia. Troppe volte vorrei dirti: no
E poi ti vedo e tanta forza non ce l'ho
Il mio cuore si ribella a te, ma il mio corpo no
Le mani tue, strumenti su di me,
che dirigi da maestro esperto quale sei...

E vieni a casa mia, quando vuoi, nelle notti piu' che mai,
dormi qui, te ne vai, sono sempre fatti tuoi.
Tanto sai che quassu' male che ti vada avrai
tutta me, se ti andra' per una notte...
... E cresce sempre piu' la solitudine,
nei grandi vuoti che mi lasci tu!

Rinnegare una passione no,
ma non posso dirti sempre si' e sentirmi piccola cosi'
tutte le volte che mi trovo qui di fronte a te.
Troppo cara la felicita' per la mia ingenuita'.
Continuo ad aspettarti nelle sere per elemosinare amore...

So - no sempre tua, quando vuoi, nelle notti piu' che mai,
dormi qui, te ne vai, sono sempre fatti tuoi.
Tanto sai che quassu' male che ti vada avrai
tutta me, se ti andra', per una notte... sono tua...
... la notte a casa mia, sono tua, sono mille volte tua...

E la vita sta passando su noi, di orizzonti non ne vedo mai!
Ne approfitta il tempo e ruba come hai fatto tu,
il resto di una gioventu' che ormai non ho piÃ¹...
E continuo sulla stessa via, sempre ubriaca di malinconia,
ora ammetto che la colpa forse e' solo mia,
avrei dovuto perderti, invece ti ho cercato.

Mia Martini,"La costruzione di un amore 
spezza le vene delle mani
Mescola il sangue col sudore 
Se te ne rimane
La costruzione di un amore
Non ripaga dal dolore
È come un altare di sabbia 
in riva al mare

La costruzione del mio amore
Mi piace guardarla salire
Come un grattacielo di cento piani
O come un girasole
Ed io ci metto l'esperienza
Come su un albero di Natale
Come un regalo ad una sposa
Un qualcosa che sta lì e che non fa male

E ad ogni piano c'è un sorriso
Per ogni inverno da passare
Ad ogni piano un paradiso da consumare
Dietro una porta un po' d'amore
Per quando non ci sarà tempo di fare l'amore
Per quando farai portare via 
la mia sola fotografia

Ma intanto guardo questo amore
Che si fa più vicino al cielo
Come se dietro l'orizzonte 
Ci fosse ancora cielo
Son io, son qui e mi meraviglia
Tanto da mordermi le braccia
Ma no, son proprio io 
lo specchio ha la mia faccia

Son io che guardo questo amore
Che si fa più grande fino al cielo
Come se dopo tanto amore
Bastasse ancora il cielo

E tutto ciò mi meraviglia
Tanto che se finisse adesso
Lo so io chiederei
Che mi crollasse addosso

E la fortuna di un amore
Come lo so che può cambiare
Dopo si dice l'ho fatto per fare
Ma era per non morire

Si dice che bello tornare alla vita
Che mi era sembrata finita
Che bello tornare a vedere
E quel che è peggio è che è tutto vero
Perché

La costruzione di un amore
Spezza le vene delle mani
Mescola il sangue col sudore
Se te ne rimane

La costruzione di un amore
Non ripaga del dolore
È come un'altare di sabbia
In riva al mare

E intanto guardo questo amore
Che si fa grande fino al cielo
Come se dopo tanto amore
Bastasse ancora il cielo

E tutto ciò mi meraviglia
Tanto che se finisse adesso
Lo so io chiederei
Che mi crollasse addosso, sì

E tutto ciò mi meraviglia
Tanto che se finisse adesso
Lo so io chiederei
Che mi crollasse addosso, sì",La Costruzione di un Amore,1999
Mia Martini,"Imagine there's no heaven
It's easy if you try
No hell below us
Above us only sky
Imagine all the people living for today

Imagine there's no countries
It isn't hard to do
Nothing to kill or die for
And no religion too
Imagine all the people living life in peace, you

You may say I'm a dreamer
But I'm not the only one
I hope some day you'll join us
And the world will be as one

Imagine no possessions
I wonder if you can
No need for greed or hunger
A brotherhood of man
Imagine all the people sharing all the world, you

You may say I'm a dreamer
But I'm not the only one
I hope some day you'll join us
And the world will be as one",Imagine,2003
Mia Martini,"Sai, la gente è strana
Prima si odia e poi si ama
Cambia idea improvvisamente
Prima la verità poi mentirà lui
Senza serietà
Come fosse niente

Sai, la gente è matta
Forse è troppo insoddisfatta
Segue il mondo ciecamente
Quando la moda cambia
Lei pure cambia
Continuamente, scioccamente

Tu, tu che sei diverso
Almeno tu nell'universo 
Un punto sei, che non ruota mai intorno a me
Un sole che splende per me soltanto
Come un diamante in mezzo al cuore

Tu, tu che sei diverso
Almeno tu nell'universo!
Non cambierai
Dimmi che per sempre sarai sincero
E che mi amerai davvero di più, di più, di più

Sai, la gente è sola
Come può lei si consola
Per non far sì che la mia mente
Si perda in congetture, in paure
Inutilmente e poi per niente

Tu, tu che sei diverso
Almeno tu nell'universo
Un punto sei, che non ruota mai intorno a me
Un sole che splende per me soltanto
Come un diamante in mezzo al cuore
Tu, tu che sei diverso

Mia Martini,"Stiamo come stiamo mezzanotte nella mano 
Di qua dal cielo e pertanto 
Slacciati i pensieri dura finché dura questa eternità 
Stiamo come stiamo usati di seconda mano 
Nel cuore un buio totale 
L'unico innocente che sorride e fa i miracoli che fa 
Lega questa sera i tuoi bottoni della giacca 
Ci pensi ancora a morire 
La felicità da quale parte si è nascosta 
Onda su onda verrà 
Stiamo come stiamo con quel muso da aeroplano 
E un gatto rosso di colore 
Presi in contropiede da una nuvola di semioscurità 
Giorni senza scuola giorni rabbia che poi vola 
In mezzo ai piatti di carta 
Stiamo rotolando come tanti cuori in gola 
In cerca ancora di noi 
Ma i fari passano tagliando la notte sopra il mare 
C'è una piramide di cielo ancora da scalare 
Per noi soldati di ventura in questo metro quadro 
Sì però adesso è molto dura 
Lo sfameremo questo amore così magro 
Stiamo come stiamo mezzanotte nella mano 
Di qua dal cielo e pertanto 
Slacciati i pensieri e dura finché dura questa eternità 
Sono sabbie mobili le terre di speranza 
Ma non c'è strada migliore 
La felicità da quale parte si è nascosta 
Onda su onda verrà 
Ma i fari passano tagliando la notte sopra il mare 
C'è una piramide di cielo ancora da scalare 
Per noi soldati di ventura in questo metro quadro 
Lo sfameremo questo amore così magro 
E i fari passano tagliando la notte sopra il mare 
E quelle stelle sulla testa nascondono sorprese
I sogni partono fischiando le ruote sui dolori 
Restiamo appesi con lo sguardo 
Che forse i tempi sono meno duri",Stiamo Come Stiamo,2006

Mia Nicholson,"Baltimore Oriole
Took one look at that mercury, forty below
No life for a lady
To be draggin' her feathers around in the snow
Leaving me blue, off she flew
To the Tangipaho-down Louisiana
Where a two-tiin' Jaybird
Met the divine Miss O

I'd like to ruffle his plumage
That Baltimore Oriole
Messed around with that big guy
Till he singed her wings
Forgivin' is easy-it's a woman like, now and then
Could happen to thing
Send her back home

That same old voodoo follows me about
That same old pounding in my heart, whenever I think of you
And baby I think of you
Day in and day out

Day out, day in
I needn't tell you how my days begin
When I awake I get up with a tingle
One possibility in view
That possibility of maybe seeing you

Come rain, come shine
I meet you and to me the day is fine
Then I kiss your lips, and the pounding becomes
An oceans roar, a thousand drums

Love was a star, a song unsung

Ages ago last night

Today the world is old
You flew away and time grew cold
Where is that star that shone so bright
Ages ago last night?

To think that spring had depended
On merely this: a look, a kiss
To think that something so splendid
Could slip away in one little daybreak

The arms that clung

Creeping up on me

Now you're here on your knees
And irony never felt so sweet

You were slithering so in all your desperation

Tre-8 they ain't ready for this dog (Ooh)
Smoke One and No Limit (Ooh)
All the way from California to New Orleans
Ask em' about it, so much pain boy (So much pain)

Birds in the kitchen, palms itchin'
And all y'all niggas in the game pay attention
As I teach, ain't got no time to preach
2 for 3, 4 for 5, 16 a fuckin' key
Don't laugh, niggas like to back stab
But where I'm from see yo brother on a body slab
New Orleans, the city of the candy cream
A bunch of projects full of jackers and dope fiends
As I cry, think one day I gotta die
But I don't give a fuck cause ain't no love from the outside
As I walk to the projects
Niggas killin' dope fiends behind fuckin' county checks
And my younger homie smokin' dope
The niggas I used to hang with doin' that boy broke
And they gone off that water, water
Ain't no love from New Orleans all the way back to Florida
It's just a bunch of pain

[Chorus]
So much pain, so much pain
So much pain, so much pain

I'm feelin' so much pain, holdin' back my tears of anger
As I walk through this danger zone
That I used to call home
Strangers got my nerves all jumpy
But it's best I watch them niggas who be smilin' actin' chummy
Like it's all real
I don't know why they got it in for me
Like my girl Jill, who was sleepin' with the enemy
Never knew the handy dope was a sad one
Now I know the vibes that I felt was some bad ones
Takes a mad one, females so precious
Tryin' to move on since our best friend left us
Got my baby still stuck in this drama filled blue
Tryin' to get my pockets on so I can snatch him from this zoo
And paint a clearer picture cause the one I see now
Got my vision all blurry, hard to see my way out
Bow my head to Lord and pray hard for a change
Can lift a sister from feelin' this
So much pain, so much pain

Growin' up as a youngster, comin' around that thug life
Dog nights with drug fights just made me get my mind right
But times I just slap on ya block and leave me bleedin'
It's hard for me to run cause they might catch me when I'm sleepin'
But I'm peepin' out the go round, wipe the sweat from my forehead
Take a swig of the beer and reminisce about what my boy said
He told me keep my head up, don't get filled with all this drama
Havin' talks with my diary cause I can't have talks with my mama
And still feel my eyes fold I start to be the best
Sometimes I cock my nine and wanna get it of my chest
But I guess I'll just take it one day at a time
But until a nigga die I got these feelings on my mind
Fuckin' so much pain

[Chorus]",So Much Pain,1995

Sometimes I think the Lord is testing me 

don't want to go to jail 

I'm tired of getting arrested G 

I know i'm spitting when i'm sell crack 

but to a young nigga like me 

a G ain't no turning back 

trying to settle down is hopeless 

when a nigga and a old lady and a baby 

I can't cope with it 

a chance is something that I never had 

I'm standing on this corner 

I got my rocks in a skittles bag 

can't make a move without my boy 

I wear a bulletproof vest 

and watch my back because i'm paranoid 

you know the ghetto is a trap 

i'm not Tupac but these jealous niggas got me strapped 

raise like a criminal but born a bastard 

visions of a jail or a grave 

a closed clasket 

reminizing about my murder friends 

but i'm proud of selling drugs 

providing my family with these dividends 

my nose bad nigga like a rock star 

tired of swolling dope 

everytime I see a cop car 

can't leave this spot 

till all my fuckin crack gone 

six rocks never asked the Lord to let me make it home 

cause i'm a nigga on the run 

if you talk that shit 

i'm going to have to get my damn gun 

cause I can't take no chances 

either me or you going to die 

i guess that will be your last dance 



Chorus (Master P) 

your 187 dance, 187 dance, this will be your last dance, 187 dance, 187 dance, 

fool this will be your last dance, last call for alcohol, I mean blood's spill 

on the wall 



(Master P) 

Blood on my palm 

and I pack a glock

Won't leave no witneses to talk about it

So come dance with the devil with the gold teeth

Chorus 



(C-Murder) 

I'm waking up in cold sweats 

I just realized 

It wasn't a dream 

I shot that fool in the drive by 

another victim of the dope game 

that nigga tried to rob me off my heroin and coccaine 

a lot of pride 

a lot of heart 

so how you figure 

my rep was on the line 

of course i had to kill that nigga 

crepped up on him playing basketball 

rolled down the window 

and I shot that bitch with my soud off 

i'm kind of crazy you can't get me 

a lot of niggas scared to stand in the same room with me 

I'm bout the dope pushing money grope 

just got out of jail 

and already back slanging dope 

my daddy wasn't there for me G 

and my mom left me in the house abonded at the age of three 

so don't ask me why i'm heartless son 

cause I was raised by some killers 

so i guess I gots to be one 

I'm down for whatever 

murder, selling drugs, and robbery in any kind of weather 

my girl said i won't live long 

i'm sick because I itilize Scarface and Al Kapone 

Won't none of these niggas don't understand me 

Master P, King George, and Silkk and Cali G

They intimidated by the rounds that the tank shoot 
Tank dawgs salute!

Keep pistols drawed and cocked

The tank can set up roadblocks, we fadin all you hoes 
Want some mo? 
Then let's go, stretch you out like elastic 
Zip that ass up in plastic, have ya folks pickin caskets 
We drastic, our tactics is homegrown in the ghetto 
So feel the wrath of this sista, it's like you fightin 10 niggas 
Forget the baby boys, it's the biggest mama Mia 
The unlady like diva, lyrical man eater, believe her 
Or see her, and get that ass embarrassed 
If you're a decision maker, guaranteed you'll get carried away 
So stay in yo place, when ya hear mamma speakin 
Cannons spray, clear the way, when ya see the tank creepin

Hi i'm that nigga that rappers look up to 
If they want to know how to do it 
It could be the little bitty skinny muthafucka 
With the braids in his hair 
Used to live on Tchopitoulus 
I done paid my dues, but still playin the blues 
Nigga play me like you was scared to lose 
I'm still a fool, you ain't heard the news 
I wasn't a No Limit nigga, but I made the move 
I won't stop now, bitch, I can't stop 
You can't stop me, so, bitch, don't try 
We TRU soldiers, and we don't die 
We keep rollin, n-n-nah-nah-nah 
All aboard, it's like a band inside 
The group going hallelujah 
Niggas goin to war, got to fightin and shootin inside rumors 
Little bitch sayin he there, we there, be where?

You be Ms Bonnie, I'll be Mr. Clyde
Together we be catchin g's
Flipping keys, smokin weed
It's all about you and me
Causing major pain on this dope game
You be Halle Berry
I'll be the ghetto Damon Wayans
In charge like the Lakers
You got your pink 380
I got my black nine for the haters
My homies call you that nigga
But you my bitch
Since we banging, I guess we one click
You be that nigga that I drink with
And you don't even trip if i was to let a freak kiss
You give me rubbers so I can stay strapped
You say you can't catch no fucking rat
Without a mouse trap
So we be kicking it like g's
Its a drought, but you got a connect on some keys
You roll up the ?? and drink 40s'
You'll whoop any bitch at any ghetto party
We walk past security cause you got the strap
And when my homies see ya
You the only female they give dap
You the only nigga that I'll kiss
Make love to and still do some gangsta shit with
Like Menace to Society we kick it
I'm Kane, you my thug like Ms Jada Pinkett

Why you ills with the hotties
I'm numero uno in your eyes honey poppi
Yo lady Gotti
Thugged out, hooriding ready to kill
Yet make me feel like others can't with my sex appeal
Be riding ghetto thrills
But still the bitch behind the trigger
The bitch about her scrilla
The bitch to smack her nigga
If the tone faintly rises in his voice
The choice is mine
When it comes to haters living or dying
Blueprinted crimes illustrated by your baby
The unlady like mistress
Be all about illicit business
Bitches witness us together looking tenderly
But to scared to tell wifey, for fear of me
I'm only trying to be the one with the green papers
Bounce on the dick and help me pull off a mean caper
That's why you praise the biggest mama and you care
Other hoes get x'd out in what we share yeah
I give you rubbers for your friends for show
Take me shopping tomorrow
Short change them hoes
Save them 3 more nuts for me
Alize, hot tubs and an ounce of weed
Please, there's not a jealous bone in my body
Take me off to Jamaica
Then take your wifey to (aloha) Hawaii
I don't mind being number 2
You keep more ice on my hands and wrists
Than an ink blue
And if it all falls through you still got me
Yout true bitch nigga down to hustle

I think these hoes and these niggas out to get me man

I ain't never had nothing in my whole life
I'm from the ghetto grew up on eggs and rice
I'm paranoid, I can't sleep cause I done stole a key
Peep out the window unmarked car after me
My little homie down stairs hollerin' 5.0
But I ain't runnin' from no motherfuckin' white folks
I got the a-k spray hit the window (lay it down) duck
So nigga holler God damn, hit him in the trunk
The dogs chase me but a nigga ran through the back
That's when I seen dope and willy in the Cadillac
They said p where ya going man get in
Put the gat to his head said interstate 10
Play it off, play it off while I do a trick
Take me to the project to meet my bitch
100 g's, 2 keys, and a bullet-proof vest, like
Billy the kid I got some pussy and headed to the west

Car been parked since Friday
I looked and look back it wasn't there
But I saw him followin on the highway
And I today know that I'm gonna blast
See I don't know who's in it cause the cars windows were tinted
And I be seeing shit that ain't it ain't there
But I be seein shit, I be in places without even bein seen there
But be seen in places without even bein there
And it seems like I'm in a different time zone
This dope game got my mind gone got my mind gone
Be having nightmares in the day, I be woke but I be sleep
I looked at shock the nigga but I turned around and it was me
It got me noid, it got me noid
It got me noid, but I ain't paranoid

I beez more paranoid than a fugitive
Because I choose to live pro life
When it comes to mine my ruger 9's on cock
For all them haters with the scandolous plots
The red dot marks the spot for my nineteen shots
But I forgot the way they did ya boy
That's why I'm never on the streets without my plastic toy
They wanna trap me kidnap me duct tape my mouth
Torture me until I tell em about my man and point the dope house out
I used to be about the same drama game
That's why I'm two steps ahead of you gutter brains
You know the name mia x the biggest momma
Ghetto sara lee at the store
Betty crocker when I choppa fo' sho'
The evil eyes be watching cause niggaz be always
Tryin to get in the best players spot and knockin'
Motherfuckers head off and kris krossin
Throw in mo salt than martin
When it rains it pours, horns with the rough tones
They try to get me slung on my back
Got to watch the jealousy acts so black
My eyes be in the front and the back and the sides peepin'
For all them crooks that be out creepin'
I feel they watchin' me

They watchin' but true soldiers don't die they multiply
Keep an open eye for all them haters

For the niggaz ridin with this TRU click, it ain't No Limit
To my loyalty and strong arm authority
Admit it, I'm finna show day to day soap opera
Downtown hoes unload when the ??? choppers knock ya
Head off in a split, put ya lips
Around this plastic dick, a Kodak moment
For this click, I don't mind dyin, takin a stand
In line, while bustin my 9
I'm tryin to show you through my verbal demonstration
We ain't bout fakin
We bringin home the cheese, greens, and the bacon
Takin no shorts and nothing that'll do
I'm representin, boo, mamma's 4ever TRU

[Chorus:x4]
I be's a TRU nigga till I'm dead (we bout it, bout it)
TRU soldiers ready to die (and rowdy, rowdy)

Put one in the chamber or that plastic glock
I'm on the grind, that 3rd Ward, Calliope, pushin rocks
Gon off dolja, a No Limit soldier
Got love for killas and dealas and I told ya
But my homegirl is hella hard
Nigga, Master P, Silkk, Mia X, livin large
Gangbangin on this dope set
Smoke any nigga, bitch a click, like a cigarette
Now that's one to grow on
If you still bout it, bout it, muthafucka, bring yo bitch ass on
Cause we be bout killin, bout murder
Puttin muthafuckas in six feet girdles
Hustlin hard to pay the rent
Mamma cryin cause I know this don't make no fuckin sense
But I gotta clock cheese, to get my Gs
To stake my keys, to make OZs
Work in the project
An expedition in the house, note them pesos, we slang crack
TRU niggaz stick together cause we ballin
One for all, if we fallin
 
[Chorus:x4]

I'm tatooed up (No Limit) and TRU to the game
Steady mobb'n, you muthafuckas know my name
Down for whatever at the drop of a dime
With my TRU niggaz cautious on my rhyme, pick up my 9
Like that, but we be comin like this
Don't fuck with this click or ya might get lynched
Have your mama at the funeral, tissues, weepin
Due to the fact you got caught up in a street sweepin
No hesitation, you layin a stank
C-Murder will kill for any TRU soldier wearin a tank
We stick together like crazy glue
Ya'll read about the hatas tryin to infiltrate my fickin crew
Bow down, and give No Lomit it's props
Gangsta rap pays the bills, sellin tapes, stopped sellin rocks
Breakin bread with muthafuckin ballas
P, C, Silkk, and Mia X, TRU shot callers
They asked me would take a bullet for ya homie
Ready to die for any stomach with a TRU tatoo on it
Get more support than a city after a hurricane
Radios and videos, now everybody know my name
We be ballin like the Dream Team in my crew
No Limit for life, and always 4ever TRU

[Chorus:x3]

4ever muthafuckin TRU, thought ya knew
Nigga, it's a must, it's a trust
If ya tell me what aim, I'm a bust
See one by one, niggaz doin shows month by month
We ain't nothin nice
TRU niggaz roll tight like fuckin blunts
Fuck them bustas that lookin for us
Nigga, we ain't hard to find
Fuck em, hidin, I'm probably makin a 500 SEL
With my convertible top down
And my cellular phone just ridin
Mia told me, represent
Watch out for niggas who muthafuckin phonies
Would you take a bullet for the president?
Nah, but I'd take a bullet for my TRU homie
I thought you knew, homie
Ya'll rappers tryin to be drug dealas and killas
We killas and drugs dealas turned rappers
Everything I know
Been got in for murder to muthafuckin kidnappin
Ya'll mad cause we hustle, ya'll ain't
Ya'll mad cause ya'll can't stack bank
I'm actin bad for the tank
Ya'll do what ya'll could, I'll do what ya'll can't
Nigga get game, I smoke that ass just like dank
For everytime I'm puttin in work, add stripes to my rank
Nigga, we TRU fuckin soldiers, willin, I betcha
Nigga, if ya ball, I'm there for ya, if ya fall
I'm gon catch ya
Cause I'm gon put it down for all my hustlas
Who be nationwide ballin

You cannot see this ghetto diva, get rich either
So she wants to be a, but she's neither
Get her there, her central plans have been deviated
Tell em' why, her ho styles have yet to be appreciated
She's been waiting to see the fire from a real ho
No doubt who brings the noise like them bitches in a jailhouse
From el jay, or even worse a setback on a cold day
Those who play I hate, let it be known that I regulate
Will steal ya fate after just one rhyme
And chick ya left a buck jump after second line it's my time
So I bust without hesitance, every word man is evidence
Niggas clear the way cause ya lyrically impotent
Soft and mama likes it hard no doubt

Mia X,"(Heavy Breathing)

[Mia X]
I came to this country with my mama
Everybody called her the white girl
But you all knew I had a lil' somethin' somethin' on me
Cause my outer was slightly tanned
Southern folk called me a yellow gal
I've been out here in this world for a while now
Bringing madness and mayhem to man, woman, and child
You see my mother, the white girl had several lovers
So my father's true identity has yet to be discovered
Some call it A-1 soda others V-12
Doctor Tishner has been implicated
But all of their seeds are incriminating evidence
As far as my perception goes
My mother, she was indeed good, but I was most powerful
Just ask anybody in your hood
You can even ask those in corporate America about this mobstress
Most times, I as little as a pea, though my weight fluctuates
Size ain't shit, cause I have enough game to make you steal from ya mama
And call her out by her name
I can make her neglect her children, sale her body, perform dirty tricks
On her knees and be called the neighborhood hottie
Everybody's a thief and a liar once they make my acquaintance
They be anxious to buy my love, they lust for me
Want to hold me and test my purity, but it's only for a moment
You see the ecstasy that I give to you
It's only temporary but quite costly
I'm bossy from your very first encounter with me
I tell you, you need me, gots to have me, can't live without me
The pea, my game extends, it gets deeper
You see my skills don't pimp just the weak minded
The so-called big ballin' brothers are obsessed with me
They kill, rob, and plot on one another to possess me
They see me as a goddess
The financial path that will lead them out the ghetto
But don't they know, have a clue
That I and my mother were sent here to destroy them
To entice, baffle, and trap them
Conscious people call the conspiracy genocide
Well, what do you think
I mean you make money off me, while they pile up evidence on you
Then get you to spend all the money you're stackin'
On lawyers and bail bondsmen
They seize your property and worldly items
That have you caught up in this lifestyle
Material things that turn friends to foes
Woman to hoe, man to monster
Yeah nigga you've changed but so what
Cause I give you what you need I give you power
Make you feel invincible right by me
I make you feel like a big man, timer
No matter how fat, ugly, illiterate you are
I make the prettiest women love you
Fight over you and compete with others trying to give you babies
I make your relative, want to kiss your ass
Treat you like a king and roll out the red carpet
They've got one hand out for money
And the other hand has a pen in it so you can sign your life policy
My assistance makes you have that edge over the next man
Cause it's all about me and money, the root of all evil
The necessities of function in this society
I make all your gangsta dumbass stories interesting
Cause you are the man
I mean we listen in awe as you speak of your murder tales
Ménage a trios, homosexual advances, and secret romances
I'm bout it and I make you feel bout it bout it
I split family, split friends, split lovers and even business partners
So niggas nickname me crack, ain't that something
I'm the reason why a lot of people are homeless, crazy, crippled
Why they're HIV positive and dead
But you still want me, feel the need for me to be in your possession
Fear to get high off my intoxicating little pieces
Or to spread my love to profit
You're even willing to kill and die for me
And even though my mother, the white girl
Engaged in several orgies for my creation
I still know my father, you know him too
You follow his lead, and work with him
Claim you hate him but your actions are different from your tongue
Let's face it, you serve him faster than you do your God
We own you nigga
And as far as the ones that send I and my mother here to destroy you
We own them too
So after all my destruction, I must pat myself on the back, uh uh
I am crack, the devil's daughter
Human life, minds destroy ya
You need me, yeah ya do, for sho' ya do, you really do
So go head on nigga, take a hit
I'ma keep putting you out on the streets
Freeze you now, help me to kill you
Hoodlum poetry, food for ya mind
Wake up deaf, dumb and blind, it's time
I'm the masteress, I'm the mobstress
I'm the pimpstress, and I own you
I'm the masteress, I'm the mobstress
And I own you, I'm trying to kill you
And I'm succeeding, yes I'm succeeding
I'm trying to kill you and I'm gon' do it
I'm gon' kill you, I'm gon' kill you
I'm gon' kill you, and it's bloody",Hoodlum Poetry,1997
Mia X,"Ooh, ooh, ooh, hey yeah, ahh no
So much yeah, ooh

There's so much trouble in my life
Sometimes it gets so bad I just breakdown and cry
I got my rent to pay and it's overdue
Don't wanna sale my body just to make it through
You see I can't depend upon no man
To be responsible or even understand
It's just the way it is at this point and time
Sometimes it gets so scared unless it blows my mind
Me and my homegirls, we got a plan
Every night at seven we'll take things in our own hands
Now we can play around, let's make some ends
I got my hustle on cause money's my best friend

I wanna be stress free, rest easy at night
But there's so much drama goin' on in my life
These days, nights missed get you labeled naive
And commons get taking for stupidity
So I keep my guard up in this macho world
Cause everybody's running game on mama's little girl
We getting babies from shady, wanna-be playas
Who wanna lay us, stick ya, hit ya, forget ya while we stay up
Crying till our eyes are swollen
Single mothers got the weight of the world on they shoulders
Want em' to hold us and tell us it's gon' be alright
Even the hardest sister needs a good man in her life
I paid the price and my life is still in a damper
After times of dirty dancing, get the babies pampers
And don't talk about the welfare and how they knock us
Knowing that chump change can't provide nothing proper
While the doctors give us new-age birth control
They make the swollen to skinny
Bleeding constantly or missing monthly, scrapping pennies
While my kid's daddy slinging those Z's
But ain't doing shit for neither one of these
Should I ease up, grab a case, and set it off like Jada
Break with the paper, get in a comfort zone from pullin' capers
Makes us wanna holler, scream, and shout and say
Oh father, why I got live this way

[Chorus]
I don't know why I live this way (I don't know why I live this way)
I don't know why I live this way (Ooh, ooh, ooh, yeah, yeah)
I don't know why I live this way (I don't know why I live this way)
I don't know why I live this way (Don't know why, I live this way)

All my sisters keep ya head up, we ain't giving up without a fight
There's been a struggle but pretty soon we gonna bubble
Though trouble be knocking on my door like every 24-7
Heaven knows that I like to keep the bills in check and
Letting my kids down on they birthday
Gnaws at my heart and tears me apart
Can't let it go like this
Racing through the malls at Christmas time, Babylon
Got my mind on trip, December 25th ain't gotta bit
To do with Christ or his birth
Greedy devils give us pagan, holler
And profit off us give praise for better days
Better be ahead of what I said
Third, I can see I can destroy the mental chains on our enslaved brains
Cocaine, be the aim, be the means of profit
But logically it tells me I'm going to jail and getting killed
Oh well, I gotta do what I gotta
Until a new day when I don't have to ask why I live this way

Keep my babies, yeah I struggled
But God ain't give me more than I could handle
Sent me two angels when my life was tangled in knots
And they're all I've got
My everything so pure and sweet
Two perfect little parts of me, the heart of me

And fix ya meals, cause you both gave me the will power

If y'all use drugs y'all will destroy ya minds, lie, and steal
Lose ya self-respect, essence and ya pride

If y'all sleep around unprotected
Expect to have a bunch of little children
All diseases that can't be cured and
If y'all quit school ya play the fool that's half steppin'

This is how it's supposed to be
And I'ma keep my children close to me
Hope to be, the best mama that I can

And guide me with ya righteous wings

That's why No Limit is rowdy rowdy!

Uh, you know that na na don't fake none 
Millions by the Mason 
Shit, money I'ma take some 
Ask P, he know that Fox gettin' nasty 
Little sassy ass, 'bout it 'bout it 
Hoes know I don't play that free shit 
Make 'em lick my shit hard 
Then leave that nigga with his dick hard 
Huh, you got to work me to hurt me 
And when I'm bored fuck around on how you jerk yours 
From NY to NO, niggaz know they my hoes, bringin' my doe 
want to floss wit' me in the front seat of your 3 
Hundred Benz-do, watch us work them ends though 
Baddest bitch with that multi platinum clit 
Peep this, don't let a trick fuck you when I know you lick

That's ya beat

[Mia X]
Oh, OK well come here baby, why you holdin' up, you know I love you
I know you still ain't trippin cause you seen that nigga downtown
I don't care nothing about him
You ain't seen no kissing, you ain't seen no hugging, none of that
No emotions cause I give all my emotions to you
You want me to make you feel extra special
Now look at ya I see you trying to fight that smile back off ya face
My baby, please don't give it to me, now give me some sugar
Alright now, you know you my million dollar nigga
So why don't you go on and make it happen for mama

[Verse 1]
See I flip scripts on niggas blow they mind like the wind
Iceberg Slim pimped hoes, but I got my money and clothes from him
Gator skin boots and purses for my slick verses
When I ride it I twerk it, leave they body jerkin' and twitchin'
Then I position my frame of thought
Spit game, eye contact so it can soften his heart
I lie if I have to even cry if I have to
But in the end it's the law, they gon' buy what I ask for
No rushin' I make sling it all then bring it all to me
I used to be a rider, flyer now I'm retired see
I took lessons from Big Vie and 67
She still got them niggas down to do whatever
I ain't gon' lie it's well known, I'm a fool in the bed
And I understand full blown, niggas suckers for head
Raw skills leave em' for dead, toes curl then shed
Moaning, sighing, shivering like a little ol' bitch
Just the art of pimpin' and pussy whippin' excites me
After hearing the show ladies want to be just like me
Shiesty, to keep my queen property and nice ride
My game's so tight it's unladylike

[Phone Conversation]
Hey darling, it's daddy put mommy on the phone
Yeah Barbara it's Richie yeah look I ain't never coming home no more
Take it easy

[Verse 2]
I ain't right, cause I especially
Send my nigga out to play on and flirt with other broads with big cheese
I even dress him and tell him to say the shit we like to hear
Tell her you want a commitment and want to build shit with her
Don't forget to lick the pussy nigga, eat your Wheaties
Cause you gon' need to bust about three or four nuts, no speedys
Cook the breakfast and the flowers only
He gon' comeback knowin' where the safe's at,
And he gon' take that and bring it on to mama
Send me off to relax, with my girls in the Bahamas
Sipping pina coladas
And I'ma be on the sand, plotting on his friends
Especially the dark one with the six-hundred Benz
His ends is long, he say he don't buy me shit
Two weeks later, that same nigga, I was driving his shit
With the keys to his crib, Prada full of his G's
Knew the secret hiding place for the China and weed
All my need he's trying to fulfill
want to be my number one, every time I make him come
It's like the boy gets dumber and dumber
Cause mama say I got him under a gree-gree
Take me shopping in New York, let them repossess her car, unladylike

[Phone Conversation]
Yeah, man your not ruining my whole day, just do what I say
Man just the other day I run into the law
He up and out left with all my ends, ya dig
Man I love my baby, I'm waiting for her to come back
She has been gone three months man, damn

[Verse 3]
Nigga, MC's is always talkin' bout the game they got
want to be pimps and playas but what about that beef cock
Heifer, that got you missing studio sessions
And got you calling her all day sweatin'
Is you the same nigga to get on a mic and say fuck a ho
Even though the one you love is up in ya bed, giving head
To the nigga that I sent, coming back giving me fifteen percent
Now, now I listen to your record and I laugh
You weak for ass, and you know this compare the math
Talkin' to a real pimp and I'ma drop it
Cool off nigga, I know ya mad but don't knock it
The truth hurts like life's a bitch
And she happens to be down with No Limit, and money shit
Mama Mia, x-rated, extra hard, extra tight, extra unladylike

Bite the hand that feeds you, and you'll wind up broke

Hey yo Snoop (I used to)
I used to cook up dope, ride with niggas
Know about the hits, hang with killas
Take the broads down for the jailhouse visits
Keep my bed warm with a cutthroat nigga
Have the card parties where the stakes was high
Go shopping hit the club and then stone em out
Never had a day without no drama
Half the OG's age, but they call me Mama
Had the ganja overstuffed in the hefty bag
Orange peels to kill the smell slanging with my dad
I never thought about my life I swear y'all, for real
Until my best friend Jill got killed and then I
Dropped to my knees and called to the Lord
Please change my ways cause I'm living too hard
And too foul, how I'm gon' raise a child
When I'm out here buck wild, damn, I had to slow down

Yeah, I slow my roll down to a pimp strut
And started putting all this game on records for my come up
From sun up to sun down, I'm trying to get my money

It's funny when a bitch was livin' foul
Every body seemed glad, but now they mad
Cause I'm flossing, boss ballin' guilt free
And Feds can't take shit from me, so slow down

Intro: see murder (talking) with Porsha singing. 
This is a story about my childhood years. 
For all my niggas. 
For my life as a ghetto child. 
. There's so much pain 

Verse 1: ???? 
I remember as a little kid. 
Growing up. Many of my friends didn't make it up to bricks. 
Punished for the shit that they did  it gets so hard to live. 
Mama cut the same tears  livin' in fears. 
Wondering if their son died or survived. 
But mama, I'm cutting the 45. 
I die, tell mama don't cry. 
Dry eyes, ‘cause how I live. I know to smile. 
A young misbehaved child, running in the streets wild. 
Try to make my money, pop. 
My eyes are getting slim. 
And my life is getting down, and I feeling like death is near. 
And I'm hoping that the heaven's here. 
I cry, ‘cause the Lord knows how m! any years I've tried. 
But this life's a lie. It ain't not a hope unless a nigga die. 
Lord why!!, Lord why!! 

Verse 2: ???? 
My childhood years was kinda rough because my pops weren't there. 
I was left to peer. Always pay but no one to share. 
These hard times, stressin' to sell nickels and dimes. 
Had to support my family, no one else was puttin' time. 
Reminiscing about on dead peers troughout the the years. 
No more tears, my childhood years with scrilla fifth. 
Who's the maycliff for all this fucking fight to stop a nigga. 
Just a price I have to pay, nigga. 
My childhood years 

Chorus repeated once: see-Murder (Porsha singing in the background) 
My childhood years, got my shit in tears. 
It's hella scary. 
I'm trapped, and I don't want to die in a cemetery. 
This ghetto ties got me livin' in pain. 
Lord knows I don't want to die in vain. 

Verse 3: see-Murder 
My childhood years was spend in cemeteries bearing my peers. 
Many tears, that I have shaded, for my niggas disappeared. 
In a bad year. Now with depressed in just memory. 
Drinking Hennessy. To dry away my misery. 
Trapped since birth, a ghetto child living in curse. 
It's getting worse, until I'm covered up in dirt. 
The pain it hurts. 
That be the reason why my blast first. 
‘Cause I refuse to be a victim in the black hears. 
Memories up with child runnin' wild. 
I couldn't smile, because my motherfuckin' life was foul. 
A troubled child, stressin' from his childhood years. 
Heavenly father. Could you please wipe away my tears. 

Verse 4: Reginelli 
I could remember way back, when a! nigga was sick. 
I just to watch my brother do some dangerous shit. 
Staying out all night, mama worrying sick. 
Wondering if he was dead or just play with a bitch. 
But when I saw this wild nigga came up like I did. 
When I eat dwellars, when the niggas start to slanging that shit. 
I tight up on my hustle. Start to paying the bills. 
Shading tills, ‘cause my brother got locked up for three years. 
After that a nigga start to grabbin' the mic. 
Write rap, on sheet of paper, making solider shit tight. 
Three years later, my brother came home from jail. 
Tellin' me he wrote rap, when he was strapped in a cell. 
A week later, we was some No limit soliders. 
Gambino family, for all the readers and rollers. 
But you can tell a nigga been shading some tears. 
By the way I live. 
My childhood years. 

Chorus repeated once.

When you see them tanks, you know who we are 
You on a mission with your pussy 
You after my papers, straight asshole naked on your way to my table 
So I played it cool, and tried to act surprised 
Knowin' damn well I've been watchin' this bitch from the side of my eye 
She looked my in my face and said ""Don't I know your name?"" 
You out the South, y'all bout it, you want to get entertained? 
I said be	, I'm not tryin' to be too much, but I'm chillin' tonight 
My mouth said no, my dick's sayin' fuckin' right

To make me shake it work it twerk it, take a nigga there 
To the sky, get 'em racked up 
Tryin' to have relations, dick at atten-hut 
What, what 
Whoa now daddy, love to love ya baby 
But you know you gotta pay me, prolly got a old lady 
And a few rug rats at home to feed 
But you tryin' to run that line 
What you think, you Gineuwine the bachelor 
I'll pass you like you don't exist 
And part my ass like the red sea, and tell you to kiss 
You be the same nigga known to get your fuckin' mack on 
And call the wife, it's so precise, and say you won't be back home 
Mama's sunshine all in your face with that southern wine 
Rodeo style till your toes curl and I'll be 
Laying in the gap so picture perfect 
Now do you really want to see a bitch twerk it?

[C-Murder] 
Don't play no games, 'cause boy we be bout killin' 
You ain't got shit to die for you shouldn't be livin' 
Get rid the fuckin' smirk ain't a damn thing funny 
All my niggas know we live for weed and money 
Platinum and vogues on the walls of my company 
'cause TRU niggas live life motherfuckin' G's 
Presidents and playin' in every resident 
'cause pumpin' no limit shit is essential 
I make money off the words that I speak 
I flip a cassette like I used to flip a quarter key 
The rap game is like standin' on a block 
Every tape I sell is like a motherfuckin' dime rock 
Give me the money so you can keep the bitches 
They don't play no game see-Murder bout his riches 
The money talk and bullshit walks pay to get delt with 
And haters get they ass kicked

Don't Play no games boy, we be bout killin'

Don't Play no games boy, we be bout killin'

Ya we bad watch us I ain't playin' with your bitch ass

You know the name you know the game and the pain 
Bitches still the same bigger bank higher rank 
Whatcha thank your head I like your shit don't stank 
But you're gettin' spanked I'm gonna get at yours forgot that thank 
You bitch who wrong move I'm gone get you

Fuck what your friend do and who you kin to 
(Chorus)

We bout murder money weed ammunition guns and drugs 
Fake niggas stand correct show my real niggas some love 
Mrs. Thug I live the life of a motherfuckin' thug 
7 digits bigger niggas still fightin' in clubs 
You think you saw the worst bitch the worst is yet to fuckin' come 
Up jump and take everyone and your best to fucking run 
Shoot first ask questions later 
Quick before I lose ya ask what time it fuckin' was 
I guess when you're too paranoid smokin' too much motherfuckin' bud 
Don't play no games bitch respect the name bitch 
Fuck who you came with and fuck what you sayin' bitch 
You heard of Mystikal, heard of P, heard of me, and heard of see 
Either we solo or we ridin' thirty-d you can't stop me I know 
All they can do is watch me drop ya with your eyes closed 
In a project curb apartment motherfuckin' dealin' 
You want to know why we ain't smilin' 'cause we thugs we mugs

But I ain't tripping cause I knew one day girl you'd be my lady 
Probably have my baby I know it sound crazy 
But thugs need love and if you real girl save me 
Your loyalty got me a sucker for love 
And when I went to jail you sent kisses and hugs 
And I could feel your lips through your letters 
You said you wait for me, 'cause you down for whatever

From house to house to block to block to the project bricks 

Every hood them thuggish soldiers taking over I told ya 

It's no limit bringing the pain 

The other level of the game 

Niggas disrespect they get deal with 

You be in a pillow in that wooden box riding in that long black dick 

You feelin this nigga you know on thing is real 

Fucking with no limit niggas and top dog skills

Until I D-I-E and that's no L-I-E 

So bitch get off me before I spit some shit 

And break your ass off with a 45 and a extra clip 

They call me see-murder cause I put on in your dome

I hang with killers and dealers, weed smokers and G's 

No limit niggas don't fall off so fuck my enemies

If I come from around the corner I'm a knock up your head

Mia X,"This song is dedicated to all the responsible brothers other there
who's how love and support to their children
I'd like to say thank you
'cause I have a very important man in my life
He means the world to me
He helped make into the strong woman I am today
I'm talkin about my Daddy

Verse One:

I think back to the first time I messed up
You knew that I need to be
But you couldn't chastise me
Daddy's little girl
Most precious of all
You loved me more than anything
Your real life babydoll
Bounced me on your knee
Taught me how to throw my set up
Said you ain't got no brothers
Fight dirty
Don't take nothin
Saw you bustin your butt to keep the bills paid
Saw you hustlin for extras
For more pay you made a way
And tried to keep us happy up in the house
'cause you wasn't tryin to see 
Your queen or your princess pout
Doubtin out sometimes
But you tried to hide your pain
And be a tru playa in this white man's game
Never called my mama out of her name
Showed respect
Never put your hands on her
Even when she backed you in a corner
So Iwant to say you are appreciated
And this love song is dedicated to my daddy

Chorus:  repeat 2X

Thank you Daddy
I know that I'm blessed
To have a father like you
'cause you've done your best
Under so much stress in the crazy world
God knows you tried
Even when they got your hands tied

Verse Two:

Remember when I came home seventeen and pregnant
And unexpectedly
But your disappointment never did show
You looked me in my teary eyes
Then you smiled
Put yoru arms around me
Said my baby's giving me a grandchild
Showed my boyfriend love too
Didn't come preachin or beefin
Just said you know what you gotta do
And when he didn't
You didn't rub it in
You just did his part
And tried to heal my young broken heart
I thought the things you said way back for certain
was jus to try and keep me a virgin
But with all the hurtin and the drama I been through
I wish I would have listened to you
'cause it was all true
Daddy the man who loves me unconditionally
through thick and thin
You'll always stand by me (fo sho)
Daddy I love you with all my heart
You're my souljah
My hero
My shining star
Thank you

Chorus:  repeat 2X

Verse Three:

I gotta give love to all the real strong brothers
Responsible daddies
Even if you're not with your baby's mothers
Your support
Your love and your time
Helps keep your children in the right frame of mind
And to the single fathers out there
Much respect
I'm a single parent too
So I know where you're at
And where you're coming from baby
But it's gonna get better
Hold your head through the stormy weather
And stand your ground firm
And all my sisters with good men at your side
It sure feels good to see the ??? family rise
I've cried joyful tears
Happy as can be
To see man woman and child
As one family
See the cards are stacked up against us y'all
So we gotta work it out
Can't let em see us fall
But most of all 
Thank you God
'cause for years I had an example of what a real man is
My daddy

Chorus:  repeat 2X

Oh I want to thank you for all you've done for me
I want to thank you",Daddy,1998
Mia X,"[Chorus: see-Murder]
Don't blame me for the pain the world has caused
Don't blame me for your own imperfectionate flaws
If every individual were to accept his own blame
I think the world would be a better change
A better change

Nigga don't blame me cause my lyrics hittin your chest like gunshots
And my thoughts seepin into your brain like cooked rocks
It's like a thick I have on a nigga mind is ??? why'all
Sort of like ???????? of thugs
To break off from an overrated government full of corruption and hypocrites
That try to immoralize yourself when they untouchable by laws, that's bullshit
They say I'm overrated, but I'm highly educated
Incarcerated but reinstated and I know them faders really hate it
Rest in peace Malcom and King, TRU soldiers of the black folks
See while why'all gone, I'm a be a mouthpiece for the ghetto
I feel like it's my duty, I be elected through spirit
One of the chosen few soldiers from the infamous No Limit
Records, a cooliation of highly respected ghetto millionaires and servents
Just some independent brothers that deserve it
Now don't point your finger partner, just practice what you preach
Cause it really ain't my fault playa, so don't blame me

[Chorus]
[Mr. Serv-On]
Believe me
If I had my wish I'd robbin every day nigga wake
Cause if you let the world tell em my lyrics are the reason why
Lil niggas took the pains they can't take
Or the troubles he left behind
Why I gotta be the vision
I ain't even lookin at when your child choose music and he choose mine
But if you was a better parent he wouldn't look up to my kind
And time life taught me
The last minutes of your life is like bail, you either make it or you don't
You either goin love me or you won't
But don't blame me when your child ain't got enough to eat
And nigga I appreciate if you goin buy my CD's
But why'all ain't got a decent pair of shoes on his feet
The streets taught me you gotta accept your blame and don't blame it on others
I look at my mother and I watch her suffer
But we beat the bad times in uptown
And nobody gave a fuck, everybody came around
We made it on our own
And turned a fucked up life into a happy home

[Chorus: see-Murder]
[Mia X]
Don't blame me because my skin tone's like God's own
The oldest skeleton was chose to be an Africans born
I'm from a strong race of people who can never be denied
Every tear we cry's like rain water and so our sea dries
Ghetto flowers shades of ebony in full bloom
Women of color got sentenced, blessings unto our womb
They'd rather see us doomed, placin flowers on tombstones
But BeBe's kids multiply while why'all tryin to plum to save your own
Label me wrong because I spit the raw real
Why'all feel all my verses, even if I curse it's straight through em
Screw em, I takes my blame, you hypocrites make me sick
Tryin to sabotage my arches, thoughts stay on some scandalous shit
Get a grip on the way you truly live
Entertainment can't raise your little kids
Run your households
You got to mold their minds and tell them what to look out for
Gangsta rap won't be a cop out no more

Mia X,"Verse One:

Playaz meet me at the club 'cause it's goin down
Master P got a party and you know we gone clown
It started at 10 ends when you leave
So I guess that's tomorrow if you party like me
I can't see the dancefloor 'cause so many feet
But dead smack in the middle's where I'm trying to be
Valet got my Benz parked in VIP
No doubt that's the section for the cars all paid out
We in the house niggaz screaming T-are-you
More ice on our bodies than an igloo
Can we get you anything to make you feel at home
All expenses on us
Get your eat and drink on
Money really ain't a thing 
That's why the name's No Limit
Known for goin all out to have you all up in it
So let's get it started 
And the real tru playaz gone shine at the party

Chorus:  repeat 2X

Imma shine at the party
Sportin like 10 karats
Flex like seven figures

Gettin jiggy in the club
All eyes on us
And as far as money goes
y'all know what's up

Verse Two:

My girls mix hennessy with alize
We in full effect
Now we got that rowdy crowd
But all playaz ain't nobody tryin to get knocked out
The guys got the poker game goin on in the back
The ballaz baby the niggaz with the briefcase kinda cake
High stakes fo sho head bustaz at the door
You can't look in without four figures or more
The place is like a fashion show
Everybody's feeling right
Big face Frank-i-lins falling from the sky
It is our mama first lady of the tank
Major crazy bank straight flossin think I ain't?

Got they heads aching 
So they acting like they got beef
Knowin damn well if they see me they gone speak
I'm Mama I'm respected y'all know this
But shits gone really get hectic
If y'all don't stop slow this ??? down now
The issue ain't who I'm loving or fucking
The big issue's billboard 'cause I'm on top of it
The issue is I got my kids up out the projects
And bought my moms a new house 
Before my second album came out
Respect my mind 
I took my grandparents out the hood
I'm seein to it that their golden years be all good
So bestill the fact that I ain't selfish or greedy
Ask my people am I there when they need me 
Like dat

Chorus:

I'ma leave you hoes in the same place
No progess
Talkin bullshit while I elevate
And I'ma keep looking out for the real
But I don't give a FUCK how the rest of y'all feel
And I'ma keep on learning the game
And I encourage all the my souljahz to do the same
I come in peace and I try to pack fair
But if you want to I will take you there
Like dat

Now I don't owe a motherfucker a god damn thing
And I earned the right to be the biggest mama on the tank
I sacrified beaucoup
Put in so much work
Kept it TRU 'cause I'm TRU 
And represented my turf
Downtown seven ward hard head 
Ya heard
Around a gang of uptown niggaz
Straight screamin the third
Been bout it 
Been rowdy
Been throwin for mines
It was just me and Jill on the scandalous rides
No hip hop lines to make me sound hard
It ain't no act
It's a fact
When it's on I go off
But as God as my witness
I love being nice
Until this playa setting in my household was right
I like to just be me
While you be with your knot

Cause, you actin' like it don't even matter no more
Sometimes, I feel we in a race, tryin' to make it to the door
Is it that I bore you, is it someone else again?
Should we put this to an end, and maybe start again as friends

Makin' love all night, callin' me your baby
But things got shady, now we ain't even close

Remember the excuses and the lies I had to tell
?Put penance? for your bail, even though you gave me hell
When you was snortin' more than half of what you had to sell
Put up with all your flings, hold my head, feelin' sad
But through all the bull, you know it wasn't that bad
You used to make me laugh, show me love and respect
But if you don't make a change, you'll be callin' me your ex

I can't help but think of all the good times we had
When everything was so right
You know I can't pull all the weight by myself
And I feel like that's what I've been doin' lately
It's a 50/50 love in a relationship, remember that
Now you runnin' wild out here(Mama Mia, not gonna let you go baby)
Gamblin' with all this foolishness in the streets
Whatcha gon' cry about? (Mama Mia, not gonna let you go no)
You know what me and you had was real
Why you tryin to let it go?
If you wanna let it go, that's cool too

And much respect like them muthafucking wise guys

Down to a gun call all from a phone call

Mia X,"[Mac] 
No Limit black sheep played the back seat for months 
Stayed away from the Tanqueray bitches and blunts 
Still Mac nigga ain't nothin' changed 
Got the rings and the gold chains 
Now bitches want to know my whole name 
I penetrate em then I disintegrate em 
I let the next nigga date em 'cause I don't hate em 
I spit voodoo to the most hard to get hoes 
And at the end of the night, I rippin' off clothes 
You fuckin' with the realest, from lyrical spillers 
To killers and dealers and cap peelers, and street guerrillas 
From villains to chillers, we made millions 
And paid killers to protect scrilla 
So what the fuck you talk about winners? 
You hear that word camouflage when you hear my name 
I represent the shell shocked 'cause it's in my veins 
(No Limit soldier) is on my left arm, I took it in blood 
Throw your hood up if you a thug 
And all them niggas say 

[Chorus: Mac] 
You see a soldier on the streets holler 
You hear them soldiers on them beats holler 
Every time them soldiers speak holler 

[Kane and Abel] 
Load your weapons, grab your gats 
We sprinkle daily verbs over tracks 
Hit the chest like heart attacks 
When my lyrical hammer cock back 
And leave bullet holes in your Bourbons and 'Lacs 
The only thing we give them hoes is a dick and a smack 
Gangstafied Kane and Abel you know the camouflage assassin 
Blastin' and mashin', kidnappin' and head bashin' 
Razor blade slashin', the endo blunt passin' 
For the cash and, woah it's bout to happen 
What you want (?) ugly with that 223 
Hit em up in 3-d, now it's banned from TV 
Niggas playa hated, I sure hated 
Spark the weed, cremated 
See this game, we regulated 

[Mr. Serv-On] 
Nigga, you know me 
The nigga that spell everything out? (nah) 
The nigga that'll run through your motherfuckin' set and bang 
your hoe motherfuckin' out (Fuck yeah nigga) 
The nigga that's catchin these niggas and beatin em down 
'cause they wearin' Tanks, they don't know what the fuck it mean 
Nigga, that's the fuck, that's about punchin' your fuckin' mouth 
The nigga that'll tear the club up 
Nigga, I don't give a fuck if you bangin' or slangin' 
Nigga when I put this Tank up nigga you get rowdy as the fuck 
But if you think I was gonna leave this motherfucker without 
spellin' a line 
K-L you done lost your motherfuckin' mind 
Stop the track 'cause these niggas don't know about my click black 
I down with the M to the A to the see 
It's the S to the E to the are to the V 
Fuckin' with the T to the A to the N to the K 
And when I come through motherfucker and I raise my Tank up high 
You best believe some a you coward motherfuckers goin' die 

[Chorus] 

[Big Ed] 
Nigga what I claim? 
Nigga I claim true! 
I hang with niggas that's killers with true tattoos 
I got my name Big Ed from what I put between hips 
I got my name Assassin from the way I empty out clips 
Wear the No Limit soldier, thuggin' at heart 
Hittin' niggas with throw aways when I toss em I break em apart 
Niggas get your guns up if you rowdy 
And when Assassin hit the stores, buy the album if you bout it 
bout it 

[Snoop Dogg] 
Rowdy gangsta in this motherfucker, loco 
So I can come through and keep it true 
and do what the fuck I must 
I bust, I keep it true from the 'ginnin 
Snoop Dogg, the representer from Long Beach city 
A true tank dog, bank y'all in y'all face 
If y'all try to come close, y'all can't run this race 
I place my self above the stack 
With my homeboys Mac and sack you fact, we strap for strap 
We got your back, don't even flip out or trip out 
Or dip out, these niggas lookin' at me strange 
My game to maintain, I let it go, I sell it don't tell it

Biggest mama, drama two guns here I come 
Put down for my last son, the camouflaged one 
Mac the don, get your shine on 'cause it's your time 
And I'ma get my rhyme on and spit like nine 
Cocked nine millimeters the ghetto diva 
Mia X-rated, golden platinum plated 
Face it, when they hear me on the K-L track 
All them niggas grab they head and jump back 
Hollin' whoa 'cause it's goin' down like lips to dick 
I'm so tight I make you bitches never want to see the mic 
And spit, the matter lesson rhymes next to mine 
I'm mama superior, you hoes is fearin' the

A lot of people don't know where I came from.
But I betcha they know where I'm going.
Know what I'm sayin'?
Sky is the limit for me.

Sky is the limit
And I won't stop until I touch the top
And I won't stop till I reach the top

I'm thinkin' back on all the old days, so easy to reminisce
People pointed the fingers and said that Magic wouldn't be shit
Cause I hung out with all the wrong type of peeps
Five o'clock in the morning and I'm still in the streets
Just a bad motherfucker, my classroom was the hallways
I guess I had to learn the hard way
Only thing that ever mattered was that my peers respected me
Living fast at a young age so them hoes was sweating me
Thinkin' I'm a grown man
I'm holding rocks in my mouth, tryin' to survive in this crime land
I'm just hustling cause I never had
So these chips that I gained, I maintained, me and my pops past
I thank the Lord for blessing me, I owe you eternity
So I fall to my knees whenever I'm addressing him
You walked me down the right path
Even though my heart was in it
You made me realize that sky is the limit

[Chorus]
Sky is the limit
And I won't stop until I touch the top
And I won't stop till I reach the top
And I'm not stopping, and I'm not stopping
Sky is the limit
And I won't stop until I touch the top
And I won't stop till I reach the top
And I'm not stopping

You know a sister went from sheets on the windows and matresses on the floor
To a house sittin on the acre with a lotta paper
Money market accounts, CD's and savings
Mutual funds, but I remember barely having ones
For real yall, George Washingtons
Had about five to get by for the whole week sometimes
Why, I used to cry to the lord
How a young black sister get it so hard
Two babies to raise all by myself, help wanted
I see the tank comin through so I jumped on it
And took a ride with some soldiers where the sky is the limit
No Limit, TRU for life and I'm a represent it
And now there's no more hungry nights
Or duckin from then niggas in the projects shootin out the lights
Ghetto flowers, your time is coming in a minute
So stand your ground and stay focused, sky is the limit

[Chorus]

I'm a product of this cruel world so my life's a fact of misery
And in my sleep I'm paintin' pictures of my enemies
Ain't no stopping me cause of my status on the incline
And I'd die tryin' to get mine
Picture me a TRU nigga
Drinkin' Don Periogne, I'm affiliated with mob figures
And I'm loving this life of luxury
I'm in the passenger seat of a 98 Navigator with my nigga C
Talkin' over another million dollar hit
Another million dollar nigga is added to the click
Mo money mo clout, I guess we takin' over
The world is ours cause we No Limit soldiers
I thank the Lord for blessin' me
And lettin' nothin' stressin' me
And showin' me that TRU records was my destiny
And I'll be in the living legends, no gimmicks
A made nigga, cause the sky is the limit

All the niggas that wanna hate me.

Bustin at the haters in the way of progress
Cause I ain't tryin to live from month to month (naw) that's stress
I only want the best that there is off the top
But I ain't bout to brag about the shit I don't got
So when you see the e4-20 know that it's mine, paid out in full
So I put it in my rhyme
Thirty two hundred square foot, no doubt
Manicured landscape, and this my house
Paid out too, so I know I got the room
To state the fact that them hoes don't like that
But fuck that big timers put your knot in the air
And cock your nine for them jackers out there
Live your life, boy

No clubs won't start without the presence of me
Ya better ask somebody, my cake give knee chills
Givin migraine headaches from breakin these bills
See these chills but can't get to it, we way out
Every (? ) that I drive on chrome, is paid out
Close to the house on the hill, but no wife
Take the diamonds out my rol, your house have no light
The more ice, I'm wicked you're sick, and just piss ya

What, I'm gonna ball never fall
See, I'm tryin to elevate the mind rate
I'm a man, I'm tired of this shit, I'm tryin to get some ends in this situation that I'm in
Black women don't even know a black man
They gonna make it from am to am, cause we hustlin
Tryin to do it but the police they are bustin in
It's just a set up

Knowing wasn't easy being both mommy and daddy
But I got down on my knees, and I prayed father please
Lift this weight up off my shoulders, whey them devils tryin to hold us down
Cause they want to playa haters crown since the beginning
Travel on gods earth with the intention of sinning
Spilling innocent blood and conquering all the land
But most of all trying to kill the black women and man
Separation keeps the household in disarray
That's been in effect since the days of slavery
Now all my sisters tryin to hold their head
And all my brothers locked down tryin to count their days
And all our babies wonderin around tryin to find their way
And everybodys gotta hustle cause we tryin to get paid
But for every cheddar knocked there's a road block
When it's goin stop, y'all we gotta keep fightin for the top
I want the pot of gold and the rainbow, I'm lettin my people know
Hold your ground firm through the setup don't let go

I imagine, how you do it, will you kill me
Feel me, I'm not scared, check it
Do you close your eyes when you scream
Do you hollar up the hallway, I'm comin nigga
It's somethin, I wonder how you play hard
Makin coke and heroin substance, yo God
Now check it, little girls see you smokin, the boys want to be you
Why you want to tell this shit to me, what you want to do

I cares not about your click or the block
I'm still that same bitch to run up in your spot and knock you off
Broad, with the cause (yeah) bitch on a mission
Keep them niggas by they nuts while you hoes be dick kissin

Cause all hoes suck dick

And stop washin' your draws in the motherfuckin fish tank
You need to get a life, go find a job bitch
Stop suckin' the nigga dick just to get your nails fixed
How many licks in a mother fuckin' lollypop
She'll call you maxwell
Bitch will suck me till the last drop
Don't blame it on the drank and the weed bitch
You and harry are gettin' on your fuckin' knees trick
From your sister momma auntie daughter g
I know your ass back in the mail for me
Now your hustlin' bustin' your ass for shit
Cause ain't no nigga in the hood gettin' your hair fixed

And I'm a let you hoes know who you fuckin' with

Claim you pimpin' hoes and reppin' on your dicks
But really bustin' nuts like water, balloons in your hands
I gives a damn about you cum catchers
And I betcha thought that it was just another dog a bitch rhyme
But mia keeps it on her mind and I don't mind tryin'
A whole heap of niggas runnin' off at the pussy eaters
Sisters don't give a fuck about you and we damn sure don't need ya
Frontin' ass always tryin' clown
But be the main mother fucker havin' dinner downtown
Mounds of niggas talkin' 'bout who got a funky cat
But that's because the fact is that their nose be in the crack
Yeah reppin' on your dick bitch you needs to be smacked
Cause doin' that ride is like sittin' on a tic tac
Black mother fuckers always quick to trip
But know they came up on welfare and shit
Food stamps, medicade and commodities
Section 8 in projects so how you knockin' me
And claimin' you don't trip bitch you know you breaks me off
Before you give your boys or your messy ass moan
At salon shoppin' mall and nail shop here I go
Once my pussy hairs leave your teeth lookin' like a piano

I got the game in shades, got the niggas in blades
I got them hoes on a raid, because the nigga gettin paid

Got niggas and G's, and rollin keys keys to record sto's
Get paid wit fatals, niggas harder than Cato
Nigga turnin the tables, but niggas livin like potatoes
Get chopped up in game, niggas runnin my name
Master P up in chain, is he dead he's a man
But I be bustin, hustlin, niggas ain't trustin
I'm a soldier, that's why niggas ain't trustin
No bitch or no nigga, ho or no sucka
Fiend or no clucker, but ready to hustle
With boulders, bigga than yo' shoulders
Runnin from the rollers, gone on that doja
Cause cowards despise, soldiers we ride
Killers with attitudes, but ready to die
Cause chickens get plucked, hoes get fucked
Turkeys get stuck, and niggas get cuffed
Ready for combat, my gat with my hard hat
Strapped with my crew and my niggas and all that
Down for whatever, niggas straight rowdy
Ask any motherfucker in America they'll tell ya, we bout it
Soldiers out there tech, bustin don't think
Lose ya life if you blink
Fuckin with them soldiers on the tank, cause

We No Limit soldiers, I thought I told ya

Let's get ready to rumble, them niggas stumble
Hit em with left blows

Ready to got to war? Let's go!

About face, this No Limit soldier

Now all my soldiers start fightin

Really, go deep like Jim Kelly
Fuck it, all y'all bustas open up y'all belly
Think we playin bitch, well we ain't

Put up the Benz and now we drive the tank
Cause all I want to be was a soldier
All I want to be was a soldier, soldier

We No Limit soldiers, I thought I told ya

We run this place, and I say the same shit, with a gun up in my face
I ain't scared to die, bitch like I said before, ho
3rd Ward, I'm from that motherfuckin Calliope
Projects supported worldwide by drug dealers
Transformin wimpy ass niggas into killers
Taking over, worldwide, doin shows oversea
Bringing bitches to the telly, put them hoes upon they knees
Gangstafied, like my motherfuckin homies Kane and Abel
No Limit, the world's number one fuckin rap label (worldwide)
Competition get smoked like we smokin blunts

TRU tattooed on my back bitch thats my click
Ready to hop into some motherfuckin gangsta shit
I say No Limit loud, cause we ain't scared of nobody
Organized by P or should I say, John Gotti

We be some motherfuckin No Limit TRU soldiers

We No Limit soldiers, I thought I told ya

Hard times got my mind on cock, and massive thoughts be the plot
Top priorities the family dope and royalty
My loyalty, fiends with a gang of true niggas
No colors, just a bunch of ignorant motherfuckers
Trust my pen is an infa-red
Hollow-tips be my lyrics dipped in venom when I send em
They split ya head (pssssh) wide open
My rhymes on fire blood, but you can't smoke ne'er a one
Don't try to come, don't even touch the mic
My shit so tight, it's more correct than right, when I recite
Absolutely, you booty-ass hoes and niggas
Perpetratin behind water gun triggers
Hurry up and figure out that studio Gotti's catch hotties to the mouth
Who got that clout, don't act surprised cause it's that bitch from the South
Mia X hoes, you don't want no problems
Get so much respect, even yo' niggas call me momma, the biggest one
To come stompin out the N.O., the crescent
Testin, chin-checkin, wreckin when I'm flexin on your WHOLE crew
Who wants to go to war with this lyrical arsenist
Ya talkin shit, I'll having ya runnin for the thesaurus, cause I'm walkin wit
The big dogs without hesitation, Unlady Like as ever
Full of, verbal annhilation
Escaping, po-po's chasin, want ta catch me but they cain't
I made em think, and now they too scared to run up on the tank
No Limit, you can start it, but we niggas is the hardest
To deal wit, keeps the steel, and the plastics to peel wit
In reach, so we can touch yo' ass
And leave a bout it scarf on ya face, we soldiers

Cause, you actin like it don't even matter no more
Sometimes, I feel we in a race, tryin to make it to the door
Is it that I bore you, is it someone else again? 
Should we put this to an end, and maybe start again as friends
I'm tryin to be mature, but mentally, I'm so tired
And you can't even tell me why
I cry feelin stupid, used and alone
When it's four in the mornin and you still not home
Where did we go wrong, it used to be all gravy
Makin love all night, callin me your baby
But things got shady, now we ain't even close
Treat me like I should leave, and then don't want me to go
Sometimes I think I'm stuck, ?some say we goin on that path? 
And then you raise me on the phone and please let you come back
Whatcha want to Do?

And in relationships, you got to take the bitter with the sweet
You keep runnin in and out, messin with my feelings
Playin with my mind and I know you see me trying
But even soldiers fall, remember when you fell
Remember the excuses and the lies I had to tell
?Put penance? for your bail, even though you gave me hell
When you was snortin more than half of what you had to sell
Put up with all your flings, hold my head, feelin sad
But through all the bull, you know it wasn't that bad
You used to make me laugh, show me love and respect
But if you don't make a change, you'll be callin me your ex

I can't help but think of all the good times we had
When everything was so right
You know I can't pull all the weight by myself

It's a 50/50 love in a relationship, remember that

Ya heard me, from Texas to New Orleans

A young nigga that's bout it, I mean these No Limit Soldiers

Y'all can't fade us
Ghetto cheese and drug deals that's what's made us
Now I'm space-aged pimping but not Eightball
Don't make me get stupid and leave your fucking blood on the wall
Bout' to go physco, and load this rifle
I'm from the projects where we all think alike though
And killing ain't nothing but a hobby
Don't me do a fucking 187 robbery
And like some brand new Jordans, you tied up
You sound like a chicken so its time to get plucked
By a gangsta, keep one up in the chamber
Don't make me wear your ass like some 85 Wranglers
Now you all screwed up like DJ Skrew
Don't have my money, nigga fuck you and your boo
Got amphetamines for them dope fiends
Where I'm from a little town called New Orleans
But blowing up like be	-12
Niggas don't give a fuck cause they quick to send your ass to hell
The murder capital of the world
Where niggas don't give a fuck about you, your boy, or your girl

Break you off somethin'
Don't make me break you off somethin' (x3)

Tomorrow I got court, I ain't gonna go
Nigga owe me money, thinking it's funny, bought a 64'
I'm bout to pull a kickdoe

Took the keys, took the cheese, and fucked his main hunny, hunny
Now the game is escalted, cause ain't no witnesses 
To go back and tell the Po-Po's all the shit we did
I'm looking at rape, I'm looking at kidnap
But when them bitches get here you gonna be full of hot caps
I'm breaking them bitches off, putting 'em in the trunk
Riding around P.A bout-it hostages blowing skunk
Cause getting rid of enemies to me ain't really nothin' nothin'
Pimp see bitch 14-96'll break you off somethin'

Break you off somethin'
Don't make me break you off somethin' (x3)

We coming down like a sail, in that goddamn rover
Just when you thought it was the beginning
You bitch, now its over
You can call on the Calvary, reinforcements, and your local P-D
They getting somewhere if they see me
My nigga that's how these G's be we three, me see and Master P
Sipping on Gin and Kiwi
Fuck popping in your CD, bitch we popping in them clips
And now we all up in your grill live in 3-D
With drama, disaster, and death when you make me have to blast ya'
Y'all has to recognize you fucking with murder masters
Who plaster your ass and make your momma call a pastor
Dying faster than you thought, now that's your ass bro
It's the class of 9 scrilla on the for real'a
Direct from the villa of killas, now who thinking they trilla'
Watch me fill a want to be cap pealer with them slugs
Probably for jaw jacking and jumping
Bitch don't make me break you off somethin' nigga",Break 'Em Off Somethin',2013

[C Murder] 
Throw me a shotgun nigga lets get high tonight 
Oh god please don't let a nigga die tonight 
I'm serving cluckers on the set like 24 7 
If I get killed I know I'm not going to heaven 
I did too much dirt committed too many sins 
Just scored two keys with killers in a room toastin with him 
It's time to break that shit down and bag it up 
We make crack like this now we gotta sell this stuff 
Mom's trippin, want to know why I got two beepers 
I couldn't tell her one for the hoes, and uh, one for them tweakers 
Now my money comin fast like a motherfucking nut 
And if you catch me doing bad, nigga, you gots to give it up fool 
Break yourself cause, uh, I'm bout robbing 
Check my rapsheet nigga, and ask my homies Steady Mobb'n

It's time to check my crackhouse nigga, it's time to check my cluckers

Once again young Fiend is on the block 
Dodging the cops, working out the murder shop 
You heard of the rock, well nigga, I'm slanging it 
The shit won't ever stop cause I ain't got no shame in it 
My niggas gangbanging it, lettin their khaki's sag 
While I'm sellin y'all down to the shaker bags 
Break em back, ten it is, and my condition they see me 
Behind my paper, beatin your hands, steady grinning, from the 
beginning 
I knew I could sell all construction 
Motherfuck those dealin, nigga i'm tryin to make somethin 
ain't no settlin for nothin, nigga, i'm tryin to meet dollars 
Mister ?????, and ain't he spendin all them powers 
Strawberry swallowa, but stones all in the nut 
Fiend got em hypnotized doin his drug dealer strut 
Pull up, not giving a fuck like T and T Tucker 
If you want some D, come see me motherfucker
