Karin Krog,"Last night when we were young
Love was a star, a song unsung
Life was so new, so real so right
Ages ago last night

Today the world is old
You flew away and time grew cold
Where is that star that shone so bright
Ages ago last night?

To think that spring had depended
On merely this, a look, a kiss
To think that something so splendid
Could slip away in one little daybreak

So now, let's reminisce
And recollect the sighs and the kisses
The arms that clung

When we were young last night",Last Night When We Were Young,2003
Karin Krog,"If you hear
A song in blue
Like a flower crying
For the dew
That was my heart serenading you
My prelude to a kiss

If you hear a song that grows
From my tender sentimental woes
That was my heart trying to compose
A prelude to a kiss

Though it's just a simple melody
With nothing fancy
Nothing much
You could turn it to a symphony
A Shubert tune with a Gershwin touch

Oh how my love song gently cries
For the tenderness within your eyes
My love is a prelude that never dies
A prelude to a kiss

Though it's just a simple melody
With nothing fancy
Nothing much
You could turn it to a symphony
A Shubert tune with a Gershwin touch

Oh how my love song so gently cries
For the tenderness within your eyes
My love is a prelude that never dies
A prelude to a kiss",Prelude to a Kiss,2003
Karin Melchert,"Though we gotta say goodbye for the summer
Darling, I promise you this
I'll send you all my love everyday in a letter
Sealed with a kiss

Guess, it's gonna be a cold lonely summer
But I'll fill the emptiness
I'll send you all my love everyday in a letter
Sealed with a kiss

I'll see you in the sunlight
I'll hear your voice everywhere
I'll run to tenderly hold you
But darling, you won't be there

I don't wanna say goodbye for the summer
Knowing the love we'll miss
Oh, let us make a pledge to meet in September
And seal it with a kiss

I'll see you in the sunlight
I'll hear your voice everywhere
I'll run to tenderly hold you
But darling, you won't be there

I don't wanna say goodbye for the summer
Knowing the love we'll miss
Oh, let us make a pledge to meet in September
And seal it with a kiss, seal it with a kiss",Sealed with a Kiss,2005
Karin Park,"I'm your light
Tokyo by night
Love until you burst

Don't forget
Love is not for real
If it doesn't hurt

Fill your lungs
Say your prayers
Come with me

Drink my blood
Fade to black
Come with me

Don't forget
Love is not for real
Love is not for real
If it doesn't hurt

Love is not for real
Love is not for real
If it doesn't hurt",Tokyo By Night [Axwell Remix],2014
Karin Plato,"Ask me how do I feel,
Now that we're cosy and clinging,
Well sir, all I can say is
If I were a bell I'd be ringing!

From the moment we kissed goodnight,
That's the way I just gotta behave,
And if I were a lamp I'd light,
Or if I were a banner I'd wave!

Ask me how do I feel,
Little me with my quiet upbringing,
Well sir, all I can say is
If I were a gate I'd be swinging!

And if I were a watch,
I'd start popping my spring,
Oh, and if I were a bell
I'd go ""Ding dong ding dong ding!"".

Ask me how do I feel
From this chemistry lesson I'm learning,
Well sir, all I can say is
If I were a bridge I'd be burning!

Well, I knew my moral would crack
From the wonderful way you looked,
Boy, if I were a duck I'd quack,
Or if I were a goose I'd be cooked!

Ask me how do I feel
Now that we're fondly caressing,
And if I were a salad,
I know I'd be splashing my dressing!

Or if I were a season,
I'd surely be Spring,
Yes, and if I were a bell,
Say, if I were a bell,
If I were a bell
I'd go ""Ding dong ding dong ding!"".",If I Were a Bell,1998
Karin Plato,"On the first of may, it is moving day,
Spring is here, so blow your job,
Throw your job away!

Now's the time to trust,
To your wanderlust,
In the city's dust you wait, must you wait
Just you wait.......!

In a mountain greenery,
Where god paints the scenery
Just two crazy people together.

While you love your lover,
Let blue skies, be your cover-let,
When it rains we'll laugh at the weather.

And if you're good,
I'll search for wood,
So you can cook... while i stand look-in'

Beans could get no keener reception in a beanery
Bless our mountain greenery home!

Mosquitoes here,
Won't bite you dear,
I'll let them sting, me on the finger!

We could find no cleaner retreat from life's machinery
Then our mountain greenery home.",Mountain Greenery,1998
Karin Plato,"You don't know what love is
'Til you've learned the meaning of the blues
Until you've loved a love you've had  to lose,
You don't know what love  is.

You don't know how lips hurt
Until you've kissed and had to pay the cost,
Until you've flipped your heart and you have lost,
You don't know what love is.

Do you know how a lost heart fears
At the thought of reminiscing,
And how lips that taste of tears
Lose their taste for kissing?
You don't know how hearts burn
For love that can, not live yet never dies.
Until you've faced each dawn with sleepless eyes,
You don't know what love is.",You Don't Know What Love Is,1998
Karin Plato,"""Romance is a game for fools""
I used to say
A game I thought I'd never play
""Romance is a game for fools""
I said and grinned
Then you passed by
And here am I
Throwing caution to the wind

Fools rush in where angels fear to tread
And so I come to you, my love, my heart above my head.
Though I see the danger there
If there's a chance for me, then I don't care

Mm-mm-mm-mm
Fools rush in where wise men never go
But wise men never fall in love, so how are they to know?
When we met, I felt my life begin
So open up your heart and let this fool rush in

Fools rush in where wise men never, never, never go
Eh, but wise men never fall in love, so how are they to know?
Ah, when we met, girl, I felt my life begin
So open up your heart and let this fool rush in

Just open up your heart and let this fool rush on in
Just open up your heart because I-I-I-I-I-I-I am coming in
Open up your heart and let this fool rush in!!",Fools Rush In,2000
Karin Williams,"I know too well that I'm just wasting precious time
In thinking such a thing could be
That you could ever care for me
I'm sure you hate to hear
That I adore you, dear
But grant me

Just the same
I'm not entirely to blame
For love
You'd be so easy to love
So easy to idolize
All others above
So worth the yearning for
So swell to keep every home fire burning for

We'd be so grand at the game
So carefree together
That it does seem a shame
That you can't see
Your future with me
Cause you'd be oh, so easy to love",Easy to Love,2003
Karin Williams,"You'd be so nice to come home to
You'd be so nice by the fire
While the breeze on high sang a lullaby
You'd be all that I could desire

Under stars chilled by the winter
Under an August moon burning above
You'd be so nice, you'd be paradise
To come home to and love

Under stars chilled by the winter
Under an August moon burning above
You'd be so nice, you'd be paradise
To come home to and love",You'd Be So Nice to Come Home To,2003
Karina,"A quién tratas de engañar amor, por favor 
Ya sé que este es el final, muy bien 
A quién le importa donde ir esta vez 
Total aquí­ o allá será igual el adiós, el adiós 
Perdóname si al escucharte dirigiré a otra parte la mirada 
Háblame sin tantas vueltas no utilices nuestras fallas como excusas 

A quién crees tú que dolerá este fin  
A ti que alguien más te espera ya después de mi 
A quién le contarás que yo lloré por ti 
Que ahora solo quieres mi amistad 

Perdóname me es tan difí­cil, no me pidas que te entienda 
No, no puedo 
Discúlpame pero no es tan fácil 
Perderlo todo cuando la vida apenas empieza 

A quién crees tú",A Quien,1994
Karina,"Siento un vací­o entre tú y yo 
Entiende nunca fuiste mi amor 
Cuantas mentiras tengo que inventar 
Para alejarte de una vez de mi 
Siento una pena que quisiera gritar 
A veces se ama a quien no se debe amar 
Quise quererte engañándome 
Te fui quemando sin pensar 

No, no me pidas que, que lo intente 
Otra vez, de una vez, otra vez 
No, no me pidas que, vuelva a fingirlo 
Otra vez, de una vez, otra vez 

Sé como duele comprender  
Como duele sonreí­r 
El amor es algo así­ 
Yo lo sé, yo lo viví­, te duele hasta morir 
Y nada puedes hacer 

Siento que caes en la soledad 
Quisiera darte felicidad 
Como besarte si no hay amor 
Aquí­ dentro de mi corazón 

No, no me pidas que, que lo intente 
Otra vez, de una vez, otra vez 
No, no me pidas que vuelva a fingirlo 
Otra vez, de una vez, otra vez",Se Como Duele,1999
Karina,"I'll see you on the outside and we'll
Never be the same
After all that's happened what is it that
We've gained?
Well I've made mistakes before and
Never lived them down
After all you've done for me i'm bound
(don't say another word)

To see you on the outside where we can
Both be sane
(you're speaking for yourself)
I'm bleeding on the inside
A place you might have been but now I
Know I'll (never be the same)

Well I heard you got a place and it's far
Away from here
Reality has sunken in now confirming
All my fears
I'm not gonna track you down and it's
Too late to stop
Thinking 'bout the time that we have lost
(I'm happy without you)

I'm trying to forget you and everything
We had (we didn't stand a chance)
We're miserable and it's true I haven't
Learned a thing
But now I know I'll trust no one else

(There was a time when we were back
And forth, it wasn't easy)
I guess that we're back where we belong
One thing is for sure, it wasn't strong

I'll see you on the outside where we can
Both feel shame
(you've never been more right)
I'm dying on the inside, you're never
Coming back
And now I know whatever we go through
My heart is stuck with you",On the Outside,2001
Karina,"How gentle is the rain, that falls softly on the meadow;
Birds high upon the trees serenade the flow'rs with their melodies.
Oh, see there beyond the hill, the bright colors of the rainbow;
Some magic from above made this day for us, just to fall in love.

That I'm trying to understand,
So could you be my best friend,
Before you call yourself my man

Why can't I love you in slow motion,
Take my time,
Take away the pressure on my mind
Really get to know you
But rewind
Wanna love you in slow motion
Why can't I?

You seem to know just what you want
And I like your confidence
Some things a girl should never rush
Cause If you do you hurt yourself

So much about this crazy game they call love
That I'm trying to understand,
So could you be my best friend,
Before you call yourself my man

Why can't I love you in slow motion,
Take my time,
Take away the pressure on my mind
Really get to know you
But rewind
Wanna love you in slow motion
Why can't I?

I'm too young for tears in the night
And it's to soon for this to be right
Don't wanna mess with your pride
The questions not when but why

Why can't I love you in slow motion,
Take my time,
Take away the pressure on my mind
Really get to know you
But rewind
Wanna love you in slow motion

'Cause baby I, I see the stars in your eyes anytime we touch
Sometimes I just wanna go run away and hide
But every time I do you always find a way to come and change my mind
You're my hero

I feel like a winner when you're beside me
It ain't a thing that I can't be
I feel like a winner, you're there to guide me
Like the wind beneath my wings

I feel like a winner, every time I plan on giving it up
You grab my hand and look inside of me
To make me feel like a winner
Feel like a winner

There were others that I loved in the past
Now I know it didn't last because we were destined for one another
And I don't even have to ask if you got my back
'Cause I know the answer to that

You got me covered
Anybody else is just a memory from long ago
And I found love with you here by my side
You're my hero

I feel like a winner when you're beside me
It ain't a thing that I can't be
I feel like a winner, you're there to guide me

I feel like a winner, every time I plan on giving it up
You grab my hand and look inside of me
To make me feel like a winner
Feel like a winner

When I'm with you
I feel like I can do anything

I feel like I can fly a plane, race a train, travel through the galaxies
And make the stars spell out your name
I feel like I can climb the highest mountain and reach up into the sky
Boy with you here I can do anything

I would give it all up just to feel your touch
You're the only one I need
It's like you got me star struck
Baby boy I'm part of, you're the other part of me

I feel like a winner when you're beside me

We unwind together 
Clouds uncover our sky 
Sitting in a couch made of sand 
The milky ring around the moon enchants me

Transition from day into night 
The euphoria of spinning in the moonlight 
Open up yourself to what is out there 
But don't take off like snowball down a hill 

You inspire me to be so crazy 
You inspire me to be free

And sweeping me away 
Away away away away away

And now I’m so tired

My brick off the wall.
 
No more questions your honor

The thing is, I just can’t, I mean,it’s not that  well. 
I suppose that, do you really, it’s not like if, well...
I just want my family back

‘Cause I wanna drive my car
And go very far
To live in LA

And I... wanna be a star
And get an oscar

That David played, and it pleased the Lord

The fourth, the fifth
The minor fall, the major lift
The baffled king composing Hallelujah

Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah

Your faith was strong but you needed proof
You saw her bathing on the roof
Her beauty in the moonlight overthrew you
She tied you to a kitchen chair
She broke your throne, and she cut your hair
And from your lips she drew the Hallelujah

Hallelujah, Hallelujah

I know this room, I've walked this floor
I used to live alone before I knew you.

There was a time when you let me know
What's really going on below
But now you never show it to me, do you?
And remember when I moved in you
The holy dove was moving too
And every breath we drew was Hallelujah

Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah

Maybe there's a God above
But all I've ever learned from love
Was how to shoot at someone who outdrew you
It's not a cry you can hear at night
It's not somebody who has seen the light

I don't even know the name

Your touch pours like honey on my skin, smooth it lingers
You, the cure the cause
Of my blues
My only flaw

Your sea it can freezing, I thought I'd float
I sink deeper blue, by you I'm consumed

Swept away, what good is a beautiful day, I'm alone

But I have yet to see a cause to believe
(I need to feel it, please just let me feel alright)
It comes in waves of need
Ten ways to make you bleed before you get to die

Can we give it one more shot?
Have we thrown all hope away?

Just to make it through?

Just to make it through?

This is not a requiem we're wasting time as victims
Why spend our lives on bended knee
Choosing not to be free and we're still here
All together and alone consumed with fear
That one day we'll discover how empty we've become

Sickened and ashamed
We crave what they provide us
So we'll never feel alone

The midnight moon burning brightly
Memories rush in like a river forlorn
As you lay sleeping without me

Highway song keeps me rollin' on
Still I long for you

Desdemona, I will be your only one
Oh yeah

And I make my living pouring out my pain
Trying to make it through another day
Arms reach for me on the wind I can feel them
They're a thousand miles away

Your eyes remind me of everything beautiful and blue
And I won't feel myself till I'm with you

Desdemona, I will be your only one
Oh yeah

So hold a candle till the darkness fades
Night time sleeps but not for long
My heart is pounding like the ocean
My soul's empty as the sky
But I know, someday I'll be coming home

Time goes by the twinkling of an eye
Still I pine for you

Desdemona, I will be your only one
I just wanna be, oh, your only one
I just wanna be your only one
Your only one

Karl Johnson,"A country dance was being held in a garden
I felt a bump and heard an ""Oh, beg your pardon""
Suddenly I saw polka dots and moonbeams
All around a pug-nosed dream

The music started and was I the perplexed one
I held my breath and said ""May I have the next one?""
In my frightened arms, polka dots and moonbeams
Sparkled on a pug-nosed dream

There were questions in the eyes of other dancers
As we floated over the floor
There were questions but my heart knew all the answers
And perhaps a few things more

Now in a cottage built of lilacs and laughter
I know the meaning of the words ""Ever after""
And I'll always see polka dots and moonbeams
When I kiss the pug-nosed dream",Polka Dots and Moonbeams,2003

With tangerine trees and marmalade skies.

And she's gone.

Waiting to take you away

'Cause it's my favorite holiday
But all this years been a busy blur
Don't think I have the energy
To add to my already mad rush
Just because it is the season 
The perfect gift for me would be 
Completions and connections left from last year 
World tour, aeroplanes and babies. 
Met some guys but never the time 
Most of 98 was along those lines. 

So deck the halls and trim those trees
Raise up the cups of christmas cheer
I just need to catch my breath

Frozen landscape
Chill this room for twentyfour days 
Evergreens, sparkling snow, get this winter over with
Flash back to spring time, 
Sunny again
Would have been good to go for lunch 
Couldn't agree when we were both free 
We tried, we said we'd keep in touch, 
We didn't of course till the summer time,
Out to the beach to his boat could have joined him 
No this time, it was me, sunburn in the third degree
Now the calendars just one page
And of course I am excited
Tonights the night but I've set my mind 
Not to do too much about it.

Waited all night for him to show

All ready in the oven, nice and hot 
Oh damn, guess what I forgot 
So it's on with the boots back out in the snow 
To the army all night garage but when to my wondering eyes should appear 
In the line that guy I've been chasing all year
Spending this one alone he said
Give me a break this years been crazy 
I said me too, but why are you... 
You mean you forgot the papers too 
Then suddenly we laughed and laughed 
Caught on to what was happening
Christmas magic's brought this down to a very happy en-ending.

Bouge jamais sans un truc dissimulé au ceinturon ou dans la manche,

Ouais appelle moi le gros, appelle moi le gros, appelle moi le gros.

Too hot to handle

Blazing their light
Can't hold a candle

On a magic carpet ride
Full of butterflies inside
Wanna cry, wanna croon
Wanna laugh like a loon

I tell you that you gotta let me visit my son
But then you tell me no

I can't think straight when I'm on her ghetto love
With a ghetto girl, every day's a fight now

And get top and gone, lemme think like I know I should
But a real woman needs a little bit more than wood
She expects that from me cause she know I would
Do anything, anywhere, every time for my shorty
Even though we bicker I came right back to get her
Pull her close 'till her body says hello

She's coming in, 12:30 flight
The moonlit wings reflect the stars that guide me towards salvation
I stopped an old man along the way
Hoping to find some long forgotten words or ancient melodies
He turned to me as if to say, ""Hurry boy, it's waiting there for you""

It's gonna take a lot to take me away from you

I bless the rains down in Africa
Gonna take some time to do the things we never had

As they grow restless, longing for some solitary company
I know that I must do what's right
As sure as Kilimanjaro rises like Olympus above the Serengeti
I seek to cure what's deep inside, frightened of this thing that I've become

It's gonna take a lot to drag me away from you

I know you wanna be down cause you're stickin' around

Do I wanna give you my number (na na na na)
Do I wanna have your email (na na na na)
Do I wanna hang with your friends (na na na na)
Do I want my hand on your booty (na na na na)

Cause I love you endlessly
Glowin' like a star
Be there burning long (yeah baby)
Broken on the screen
Watching words I say
Catch me as I fall

I'm professin' my love to ya
Hit me up on myspace and I'll add you boo
I'm professin' my love to ya
Put you on my top 8 if you want me to
Put you on my top 8 if you want me to

I'm looking in your eyes and I can see you doubt

Take my hand, let me move you to the center spot

Watching words I say
Catch me as I fall

[Chorus]

Cause every time you pop online
I'm eager just to make you shine
I never want you to witness the life I like
(Maybe we can get away)
We're walkin' on the beach and sand
I hold you close, you take my hand
And then I'll never let you go of u

Cause I love you endlessly
Glowin' like a star
Be there burning long (yeah baby)
Broken on the screen
Watching words I say
Catch me as I fall

And girl don't be acting all prude,
I got pictures on my phone of you acting all nude,
And don't think the dudes be acting all you,

I alone have heard this glad refrain,
Must it be forever inside of me,
Why can't I let it go,
Why can't I let you know,
Why can't I let you know the song
My heart would sing?

That beautiful rhapsody
Of love and youth and spring,
The music is sweet,
The words are true 
The song is you.","The Song Is You, song (from ""Music in the Air"")",2006
Karla Bonoff,"Youæ?®e taking all I got and now youæ?®e leaving
Ooh baby, donæ?° go.
I thought that love was something to believe in
Ooh, baby don't go.

I've seen it in your face
It's in your eyes when you turn away
You think it's all a waste
You're goin' today

I won't pretend
I won't say it won't hurt me bad
Won't you try it again
Whatever happened to all that we had?

You're taking all I got and now you're leavin'
Ooh baby, don't go
I thought love was something to believe in
Ooh baby don't go.

Don't fight, just hold me tight
Everything is gonna work out right
I won't beg,
But you heard what I said
I need you every day and night

You're taking all I got and now you're leaving
Ooh baby, don't go.
I thought that love was something to believe in
Ooh, baby don't go.

And if you close the door
I can't wish you well anymore.
You know you really turned on me,
So don't come running back æ?¶ause I know you'll never see.

You're takin' all I got and now you're leaving
Ooh baby, don't go.
I thought love was something to believe in,
Ooh baby, don't go.
And baby don't go
Ooh, baby don't go






",Baby Don't Go,1979
Karla Bonoff,"Well, baby what ya trying to prove
By beinalone
And no one can get through to you
Is there anyone home?

CHORUS:

So don't say that it's love you lacked
I paid the price now we're paying the tax
I gave it all, and I got nothing back
Only a fool gives a heart like that

Well, I said that you never gave enough
And I know this is true
I see now that you never gave it up
So you'd have nothing to lose

REPEAT CHORUS

I know that I need you
And that made you scared
If I'd known how to reach you
But I'm giving up, it's too late to care

Well, I guess that it's really over now
This is where I belong
And baby you know it's kind of funny how
All the tears made me strong

REPEAT CHORUS






",Only a Fool,1979
Karla Bonoff,"The water is wide
I cannot swim ore
and neither have I
the wings to fly
give me a boat
that can carry two
and we both shall row
my true love and I

A ship there is
and she sails the seas
she's laden deep
as deep can be
but not so deep
as the love I'm in
and I know not if
i sink or swim

I leaned my back
against a young oak
thinkin he was 
a trusty tree
but first he bended
and then he broke
thus did my love
prove false to me

Oh love is handsome 
and love is kind
bright as a jewl
when first it's new
but love grows old
and waxes cold
and fades away
like the morning dew

and fades away
like the morning dew 
",The Water Is Wide,1979
Karla Bonoff,"I can feel a new expression on my face
I can feel a glowing sensation taking place
I can hear the guitars playin' lovely tunes
Every time that you walk in the room
 
I close my eyes for a second and pretend it's me you want
Meanwhile I try to act so nonchalant
I feel a summer's night with a magic moon
Every time that you walk in the room
 
Baby it's a dream come true
Standin' right along side of you
Wish I could show you how much I care
But I only have the nerve to stare

I can feel a something pounding in my brain
Just any time that someone speaks your name
Trumpets sound I hear thunder boom
Every time that you walk in the room
",When You Walk in the Room,1979
Karla Bonoff,"The whole worldæ?¯ blue
And nothing ever goes right
Words sound untrue
But you won't give up the fight
Turn your back now
To all those things that you've seen
Close your eyes
Now baby, dream

Well, they see you
Playing real good at the game
If they saw through
All there'd be is the pain
A reward's due
For one who is lost in the rain
Close your eyes
Now baby, dream

When you held me, I was so broken apart
I had nothing but that love in your heart
And the night came, all I heard was you saying
Close your eyes
Now baby,
Dream
Close your eyes
Now baby,

",Dream,1982
Karla Bonoff,"Oh honey, let's draw the line
'Cause I know you can't really be mine
I can see it's your own heart you need to find, not mine
And lately, I can see it won't turn out the way we
Want it to be
We should forget it, and not regret it
Oh no honey, don't tempt me

[Chorus]
'Cause I don't want to miss you
I don't want to kiss you
Or hear the sweet things that you say
Don't want to know what I'm missing
I Don't want to listen
Just want to watch you walking away

I remember you and I
And we looked into each other's eyes
We could make the long, long night just fly right by
But love's illusions don't seem to last
Maybe we just moved too fast
So please don't call me
Don't speak softly
Oh no honey, don't tempt me

[Chorus]

Even though I know this is right
Can't stop dreaming about you at night
With or without you, it's still a fight every night
And me, I didn't know the way your heart could grow
So cold
But me, I'd let go, let my love show
Oh on honey, don't tempt me

Are the things dreams are made of

So goodbye, now please don't cry
For now, all the words have been spoken
Time heals the heart that's broken

That the mailman can't deliver
I can't mail it in
I can't phone it in 

I can't send it in

The thing that I'm speaking of
Is a whole lot of love 
A whole mess of love

Sometimes it blows your way,
And until now 
It missed me somehow.

But when I turned around
I saw you standing there.
The sound of your voice-
I had no choice.

I used to have a wish
One day I'd feel like this.
Now I know love exists

Karla Bonoff,"Isnæ?° it nice that we can dream
Of all the places we can't see
Fly over oceans wide
Do all the things we never tried
And isn't it strange how you can go
Back to a home you've never known
It's like you were there before
A place you've been searching for

The new world waits inside your dream
And your heart leads the way

Isn't it nice to feel so free
And love the way love's supposed to be
Never with hurt or pain
And never with something else to gain
And isn't it strange it seems so clear
That you have nothing here to fear
But somehow the morning light
Fades all the things you see at night

The new world waits inside your dream
And your heart knows the way
But isn't it nice to let it go
On to the life you'll someday know
And let the real world fade away

Once you're there
You'll know that you're inside
You can't turn back
When you open your eyes

The new world waits inside your dream
And your heart knows the way
But isn't it nice to let it go
On to the life you'll someday know
And let the real world fade away

Isn't it nice to let it go
On to the life your soul will know
And let the real world fade away

(and) What will I do when he's gone
How will I carry on

Yes I know when it's his time to go
That I'll have to grow up too
Oh can't I stay right here
And be daddy's little girl

So how did the years go so fast
Or did we just lose track
So now we can't waste any time
I'll make each moment mine

Yes I know when it's his time to go...

The time keeps moving
Life keeps passing
There's still so much to say
But I will go on
I will be strong
I will find my way

I see you in her eyes

To fly over the mountains
Though I'm standing still

They come in between
The cities of tiring life
The trains come and go,
But inside you know
The struggle will soon be a fight

Around the next bend

I don't believe that I was the one to blame

Karma to Burn,"Appalachian woman
A blizzard tearing screw [unverified]
Of what she sees before her
She'll suffer once for you

Appalachian woman
Shooting savages from her head
Rapid eyes are burning
Of the wine that drunk him dry

All my friends are alcoholics
Temptations drip from their eyes
And man I'm so tired living in this shit
Cast iron hate, black angels to the right

Steaming locomotive
She's past the '68
Butchered on the highway
There's glitter on the rain
",Appalachian Woman,1997
Karma to Burn,"Down to the flower, down in the dirt
A girl named Bobbi, washes her hurt
Her momma kneels down, ?
?

Don't buy any longer
Don't buy any more

Under the stone lies Daddy's head
Under the stone, in the cold, to the shade
Fellow died burnt from the sun
Dried for days and had never begone

Daddy, do you like me? (Do you like me?)
Ever get with me?
Daddy, do you like it? (Do you like it?)
Take it on your knees (knees)



","Bobbi, Bobbi, Bobbi - I'm Not God",1997
Karma to Burn,"Our lady of more (Repeat)

Our lady of more, this saddened whore
How I adore her, when she's on the floor

Lonely love is blind to ashes
Lonely love is blind
Lonely love is blind to ashes
Lonely love unwinds

She's like the twilight, their needle sings (?)
Skin of the mayflower, a pale reflection brings



",Mt. Penetrator,1997
Karma to Burn,"Another winter has past and gone
All his desires still remained
Having God on the run
Another winter's on it's way

They like to suck the dead to life
Smell the rot inside
Hearts, hands, eyes
Eyes, eyes, eyes

Too many people have lost their souls
Damned to a life of decay
Been a lover for far too long
Without the power to refrain



",Patty Hearst's Closet Mantra,1997
Karma to Burn,"""Hey! Hey! He was fine, just we sell out.""

They come to feast on purist man
They come to feast on mortal tan
Filling their bodies with disease
Swollen still like killer bees
For that lack from their prize
They fucked their children, staring eyes



",Six,1997
Karma to Burn,"So this is permanent 
Love's shackled cry 
What once was innocent 
Turned on its side 

A cloud hangs over me 
Marks every move 
Deep in the memory 
What once was love 

Oh how I've realized 
How I wanted time 
Thought it too protective 
Tried so hard to find 

Just for one moment 
Thought I'd found my way 
Destiny unfolded 
I watched it slip away 

Excessive flash points 
Beyond our reach 
Solitary demands for 
All I'd like to keep 

Let's take a ride out 
See what we can find 
My newest collections of 
Hopes and passing times 

I never realized 
The lengths I'd have to go
All the darkest corners of 
A sense I didn't know 
Just for one moment 
I heard somebody call 
Looked beyond the day 
And there's nothing there at all 

Now that I've realized 
How it's all gone wrong 
Gotta find some therapy 
This treatment takes too long 

Deep in the heart of 
Where sympathy felt swayed 
I got to find my destiny 
Before it gets too late",Twenty Four Hours,1997

Karmen,"You have been through
What I have been put through before
Now it's out of control

I feel the fire breakin' out
As I summon to the ground
I feel my heart go
Ooh, out of my control

I feel the tempt to turn you out
As I travel underground
I see this trouble all around
I have to let you go

I wanna let you
Take good control of me
I feel the fire
Comin' in out of me

You have been through
What I have been put through before
Now it's out of control

I've been over you, you've been over me
I don't know what to do, I'm still in love with you
I've been over you, you've been over me
I don't know what to do, I'm still in love with you

There's a question I must ask
If you travel through the past
Could you change for me?
How different would it be?

Would you love me more or less
Could you handle all the stress
That I put you through
I don't know what to do

I wanna let you
Take good control of me
I feel the fire
Comin' in out of me

You have been through
What I have been put through before
Now it's out of control

I've been over you, you've been over me
I don't know what to do, I'm still in love with you
I've been over you, you've been over me
I don't know what to do, I'm still in love with you

I've been over you, you've been over me
I don't know what to do, I'm still in love with you
I've been over you, you've been over me
I don't know what to do, I'm still in love with you

I've been over you, you've been over me

I don't know what to do, I'm still in love with you

",Still in Love,2007
Karmen Michael,"Back when I was a child
Before life removed all the innocence
My father would lift me high
And dance with my mother and me 
And then
Spin me around 'till I fell asleep
Then up the stairs he would carry me 
And I knew for sure 
I was loved

If I could get another chance
Another walk
Another dance with him
I'd play a song that would never ever end
How I'd love love love 
To dance with my father again

When I and my mother 
Would disagree
To get my way I would run 
From her to him
He'd make me laugh just to comfort me
yeah yeah
Then finally make me do 
Just what my mama said
Later that night when I was asleep
He left a dollar under my sheet
Never dreamed that he 
Would be gone from me

If I could steal one final glance
One final step 
One final dance with him
I'd play a song that would never ever end
Cause I'd love love love to 
Dance with my father again

Sometimes I'd listen outside her door
And I'd hear how mama would cry for him
I'd pray for her even more than me
I'd pray for her even more than me

I know I'm praying for much to much
But could you send her 
The only man she loved
I know you don't do it usually
But Dear Lord
She's dying to dance with my father again

Every night I fall asleep
And this is all I ever dream",Dance with My Father,2006
