Sexion d'Assaut,"On dit que ce monde est un mirage donc en fait rien n'est acquis,
Le diable joue avec nous et avec un rien nous taquine,
On se fatigue mais tout part vite comme dans un karting
Où ta future carcasse est garée dans ton parking.
Le jour se lève et mon heure fait encore un pas,
J'me tape chaque jour pour rendre à dieu mon corps intact,
Car toutes mes affaires en fait s'appellent revient
Et quand je serai dans ma tombe personne me dira je te rejoins.
A la mairie elle t'appartient pour la vie,
Mais cinq ans plus tard avec un autre elle parcourt la ville,
Quant au succès il t'appartient pas, t'accroches ap,
Si tu loupes le co-ch, le public te fait un croche-pattes.
Tout ce qu'on t'a prêté tu le rends
Même ce que tu bouffes tu le rechies,
Dis-leur chut, l'argent est un fidèle poto dealer de shit.
Dès le choc que j'ai reçu en sachant qu'on était seul j'me suis dit
""Mehlich il m'reste la foi donc j'mets mon front au sol""

Rien ne t'appartient, tu t'attaches aux biens,
Tes amis, ta famille, toutes ces choses qui t'animent
Mais un jour tout s'arrête, ça frêne ta joie de vivre!
Tes attaches, tes habitudes, tout est limité!
Oh wohoh oh wohoh oh wohoh
Oh wohoh oh wohoh oh wohoh

A vouloir tout posséder tu finis par rien avoir,
On sait bien que tout nous quittera mais notre âme ne veut pas le voir,
Si la vie est une prison le bonheur est au parloir.
Tu t'es vendu pour du liquide car ton honneur n'est qu'une passoire!
Accroché au matériel belek akhi c'est qu'un nuage,
Du quelque des soucis qui vont te noyer, il faut que tu nages.
T'aimais madame à en mourir, aujourd'hui c'est lui qu'elle aime
Avec la même fougue qu'y'avait dans vos nuits de rêves!
Le propriétaire ne fait que louer une terre jusqu'à sa mort
Ce monde t'appartient autant qu'Hitler avait de remords
La vie est-elle une illusion à laquelle on s'accroche
Ou la plus grande des convictions pour laquelle l'homme devient atroce?
Même mon corps n'est qu'une location j'évite les tatouages,
On s'imagine à la retraite bien qu'on puisse partir à tout âge
Attaché grave à ton pote mais c'est ton pote qui t'a poucave
Il se foutait de la belle époque, il a tout avoué!

Tout est voué à l'échec, les belles villas les grosses caisses,
Six pieds sous terre rongé par les vers!
Tout est voué à l'échec, quelque soit ton style de vie!
Enfouis sous terre même tes partenaires te laissent solos.

Rien ne t'appartient, tu t'attaches aux biens,
Tes amis, ta famille, toutes ces choses qui t'animent

Oh wohoh (rien ne t'appartient!) oh wohoh (tu t'attaches aux biens)
Oh wohoh (tes amis ta famille, toutes ces choses qui t'animent)
Oh wohoh (mais un jour tout s'arrête) oh wohoh (ça frêne ta joie de vivre)
Oh wohoh

On t'laisse solo sans tes sos et sans tes frôlons

Sexion d'Assaut,"Il avait 19 ans, elle avait la quinzaine
Lui c'était pour un soir elle pour une vie mais ce n'était qu'un jeune
Lui aimait les femmes et arrondir son biff en fin de mois
Fan de formes courbées plus de vingt conquêtes en 5 mois
Elle fan de feuilletons, pensée qu'il allait assumer
Lui pensait plutôt combien de spliff il avait à fumer
Et a quels sapes il mettrait pour ses soirées dansantes
Pendant qu'elle flippait de dire qu'elle était enceinte
Et quand elle lui dit qu'elle était en cloque
Il s'énerva, lui mit une claque, disant 'Tes preuves sont en toc'
Il frappa dans son ventre en disant 'Casse-toi c'est pas moi le père!'
Je peux pas porter ce lourd poids j'préfère celui de mes haltères!

Papa je comprends pas je t'ai fait quoi
Je suis tout petit, je prends pas beaucoup de place
Je t'imagine quand je suis dans ma classe

Papa je comprends pas je t'ai fait quoi
Je suis tout petit, je prends pas beaucoup de place
Je t'imagine quand je suis dans ma classe

Papa mais t'étais où?
Le jour où je suis né
Aujourd'hui maman ne cesse de me dire qu'on a le même gros nez
J'ai vu une photo d'elle et d'un homme, jeune épanouie
Elle avait le même regard qu'elle porte sur moi, seule ébahie
Papa! Elle te connaît, elle te déteste je sais
Moi c'est pire je te connais pas et je te déteste tu sais
Mais t'étais où?
Le jour de mes 1 ans, mes premiers pas, quand j'comprenais rien
Mes années passent et devant l'école
Le père d'Alpha vient toujours me dire 'Bonjour' franchement il est cool
Et en classe, de quoi j'ai peur et honte à ton avis?
Une question très très gênante, 'Qu'est-ce que ton père fait dans la vie?'
Dans quelques jours j'aurai 8 ans
Je suis le joker de mon club de foot qu'on fait rentrer à la mi-temps
Tel père tel fils, rien que pour ce point commun,
Mais pour devenir un homme, je fais comment?

Papa je comprends pas je t'ai fait quoi
Je suis tout petit, je prends pas beaucoup de place
Je t'imagine quand je suis dans ma classe

Papa je comprends pas je t'ai fait quoi
Je suis tout petit, je prends pas beaucoup de place
Je t'imagine quand je suis dans ma classe

Poto je te parle d'un papy, qu'a presque 100 ans
C'est devant la fenêtre de sa chambre qui passe tout son temps
Il est devenu dingue te diront les infirmières
Elles ont besoin de la chambre, elle le préférerait au cimetière
Les psychanalystes multiplient les analyses mais banalisent son cas puis
Négligent la haine qu'il canalise
Ses membres se paralysent, seul il prépare la liste
Des biens qu'il léguera à son fils
Pendant que celui-ci se barre à Nice
L'enfoiré est devenu généraliste
Il a une femme, des gosses, écrit tout au?
Mais, il a foutu son père en maison de retraite
C'est pour ça que je lui souhaite, qu'on le jette dans une maison de traître
Des fois la nuit, ses pensées quitte l'hospice
Il se rappelle de quand au lit son gosse pissait
Il se rappelle du centre commercial
Et des flaques de larme qu'il laissait au sol quand il chiale
Toute sa vie il a, supporté ses caprices
Aujourd'hui la seule qui le visite c'est la rééducatrice
Il voulait sa villa, ses pauses sous Pastis
Maintenant pour pioncer des cachetons faut que tu lui en passes 10",Tel père tel fils,2010
Sexion d'Assaut,"T'es love pour elle t'as tout plaqué
C'est mort ton cœur s'est fait tacler
T'es fait (j'avoue), t'es cuit (recuit)
Tout ce que t'as fait tu sais tu l'as fait pour elle
Même si ça te laisse des séquelles
Tu le referais sans hésiter

Qui sème les préliminaires récolte le love
Et qui dit love dit bosser pour amener des loves
Sur ces bêtises toi t'as souvent passé l'éponge
Tu t'imagine si tu devait couper les ponts
Tes potes t'épaulent car ta vie est un scénario
Ouais ça sent l'crash comme monsieur l'sénat oh
T'es dans la tess une nuit d'tendresse
La force d'une femme réside dans sa faiblesse
Pour elle tu fais la crête de coque à coup d'tondeuse
T'as grave changé à la base toi t'es deus
Boloss j'crois qu'elle te l'a mise en finesse

T’es tombé love sans que t'aies pigé
Tu dis que c'est l’amour de petits jeunes
Tu fais face sans te réfugier
Face à la force centrifuge
T’es tombé love sans que t'aies pigé
C'est pas de l'amour de petits jeunes
A la base c’était qu’un petit jeu
Maintenant pour elle tu prends des piges
Ses qualités te giflent
Tu demeures figé
Face à la force centrifuge

T’es love, pour elle t’as tout plaqué
C'est mort, ton cœur s’est fait tacler
T'es fait (j'avoue), t'es cuit (recuit)
Tout ce que t’as fait tu sais tu l’as fait pour elle
Même si ça t'laisse des séquelles
Tu le referais sans hésiter

Un sourire et t’as tout oublié
Une démarche t’as claqué tous tes billets
Si on parle mal d’elle tu pars en vrille et
Tu deviens violent quitte à faire crier
Ta confiance elle n’est pas entière
T’as peur qu’elle parte avec un bel antillais
Tu peines à plier tes bagages parce que
T’es trop love d’elle
T’es devenu sa tass-pé
Viens on s’ment pas
Vas y dis le moi
Combien t’as coffré pour son diamant?
Ta mère ou elle?
T'es dans un vrai dilemne (pff)
Comment t’en sortir dignement?
Ta tête fait la toupie, tous tes potos t’oublient
Tu vois les choses en rose mais ta vie est toute grise
Fuck les conseils, tu lui donnes toute ton oseille
Toute ta paye, t’en oublies même tes Kheys

T’es love, pour elle t’as tout plaqué
C'est mort, ton cœur s’est fait tacler
T'es fait (j'avoue), t'es cuit (recuit)
Tout ce que t’as fait tu sais tu l’as fait pour elle
Même si ça t'laisse des séquelles
Tu le referais sans hésiter

Elle, aie aie aie
Elle, devant tes potes tu fais blah!
C’est pour elle qu’tu t’es levé tôt le matin
En vue de décrocher la lune avant que le soleil la cache
C’est pour elle qu’tu t’es couché tard dans la nuit
En vue d’arracher une étoile filante avant qu’elle s’arrache
Elle a changé toute ta vie
Mais ce qu’elle a fait pour toi Akhi je doute, t'as vu
Tu l’as fait pour elle peut-être que t’aurais pas du
Oui j'sais l’amour t’a aveuglé, t’as pas tout vu
T’as mis des ouss de côté
T’as pris un crédit à la que-ban pour cet appart'
Dans un p'tit coin d'côté de Paris
Et bien sur à sa demande akhi
Tu vois plus tes potes ni ta mif'
Tu lui donnes tous tes sons bollosse
T’as jamais ressenti ça de ta iv'
T'es dans les choux, bref t’es trop love

T’es love, pour elle t’as tout plaqué
C'est mort, ton cœur s’est fait tacler

L'amour est mort au fond d'mon cœur
Et c'est sa rage qui ressuscite
A quoi ça sert d'aimer, si c'est pour finir abruti
Attendre de l'aide d'un égoïste, j'préfère m'asseoir sur mes soucis
J'ai vu des gens qu'j'aimais, me blesser dans mon amour propre
Des gens que jamais j'aurais pu décrire ou boycott
Gros un tas d'blessures, par conséquent des handicaps
J'suis qu'une étincelle dans l'ombre, toi t'en dis quoi?
J'ai fais des tas de mesures sans pour autant trouver les bonnes
Une tonne d'efforts sans pour autant changer la donne
J'me suis recroquevillé, trop gaspillé, éparpillé
Dans mes délires alcoolisés, claquer des tas d'billets
Contraint de dealer, normal quand t'as les poches vidés
Tu crèves la dalle mais c'est pas les hyènes qui t'invitent dîner
T'allumes un spliff, tu fais ner-tour, le seul qui reste, choqué
Par les critiques surtout quand on fait preuve d'un peu d'bonté
T'es la bonne proie qu'on pense aveugler, qui arrête pas d'donner
J'veux lâcher prise parce que j'ai les pouces qu'arrêtent pas d'gonfler
Dans nos ghettos t'es convoité pour c'que tu mets d'côté
On t'sollicites quand t'es au top ensuite on t'laisse tomber
Téma nos renps si ils ont souffert après plusieurs années
De loyaux services ont leur a dit de débarrasser l'plancher
Que l'Afrique regorge d'indigènes, putain mais qu'est-ce que t'en sais
C'est l'racisme est d'autant plus noir j'ai pris la peine plancher
J'vous en veux grave mais j'ai mes torts
Les regrets m'rongent de l’intérieur mais j'ferai pas d'excuses à mes profs
A défaut d'investigation, j'avais souvent des mauvaises notes
J'me bousillais sur du sang d'encre, sans me soucier de celui d'ma daronne
Issu d'un cœur cagoulé, épuisé vu l'trajet
Ni mon reup, ni ma reum sont venus en France pour danser
Résident, Paris Centre, beau quartier
Dans un appart', un peu plus grand qu'ton local poubelle
Malgré tout ça, tes souvenirs, des beaux j'en garde beaucoup
Dis toi qu'j'ai du vécu et qu'la hass ça forge mieux qu'les coups
Maman n'a fait qu'assumer son foyer, anxieuse sans doute
Du coup tu nous as quitté sauf que c'était pour toujours
Au moins, il reste le daron malgré l'choc toujours debout
A part ça tu nous manque mais pour le reste on gère c'est cool
Ça blesse évidemment, ça fait toujours d'une pierre deux coups
Si j'laisse couler mes larmes j'serais quasi-trempé jusqu'au cou
Plus l'temps passe et plus j'divague, d'ici 5 ans j'ai plus d'colonne
Suis-je né sous une bonne étoile?
J'en sais rien j'suis pas astronome
Les faits divers s'banalisent, à tel point qu'on en rigole
Quand les keufs passent dans les fours, c'est pour ravager la récolte
Akhi, des fois j'ai limite envie d'pleurer
Quand t'as l'cœur sur la main suffit juste d'un impact pour te l'briser
Traumatisé, par l'manque de gentillesse d'hospitalité
Ma'lish, à la rigueur y a pas d'acquis sans brutalité

C'était l'époque où y'avait rien donc on faisait tout par nous mêmes
A trop négliger les conseils des grands regarde où ça nous mène
C'était l'époque où j'allais les mains vides à l'école

Hiver 90 j'ai posé l'pied à Charles de Gaulle
La grand mère restée au bled j'en ai encore la chaire de poule
J'voyais des blancs que quand c'était le Paris-Dakar
Et puis de temps en temps j'courais après les camtars
Il en fallait peu pour m'arracher un grand sourire
Il a fallu que j'vienne ici pour découvrir
Qu'il y a plus de sauvages que dans ma brousse
J'ai vu des surins dans des trousses
Des mecs sereins avoir la frousse
Et des sirènes après mes trousses
Puis l'sort d'un black a qui on avait dit ""Va, deviens!""
La réussite est savoureuse quand tu pars de rien
Foutue pièce d'identité, elle sert que lorsqu'on nous contrôle
J'en prends le soin et dessus j'roule mes joints
C'est l'récit d'un jeune black trop stressé, oppressé
C'est l'récit d'un jeune black trop pressé, d's'engraisser
Je m'y ferai jamais c'est comme graille avec leur foutue fourchette
Comme deux heures de travail pour un foutu bout d'chèque
A cœur ouvert sans anesthésie
J'préfère vous prévenir, il se pourrait bien qu'il y ait des odeurs
Ces derniers temps il est tout noir, sombre
Blessé par des proches qui aimeraient m'voir sombrer
Et moi j'les aide en m'détruisant à petit feu
Qui deviendra peut-être une flamme que rien n'pourra jamais éteindre
C'est une des nombreuses choses auxquelles je pense
Quand j'me r'trouve face à moi même mais jamais quand je danse
C'est une des nombreuses choses auxquelles je pense
Quand j'me r'trouve face à moi même j'vous fais la confidence
Mais j'continue mes virées nocturnes dans l'excès,
Trimballe ma carcasse malgré les sarcasmes
Reufrè, j'fais flipper mon propre reflet
Mon ombre a du mal à suivre, reste bloqué dans mes regrets
Toujours en retrait
C'est pour mieux voir venir les te-trai
Immunisé, insensible depuis le lycée
Depuis l'époque des Mordacs là où les corps d'hommes forts gisaient
Poto, plus j'grandissais, plus mes rêves rapetissaient
Pour éviter d'toucher l'plafond j'me serais bien fait amputé
Aucune affinité avec ce foutu banquier
J'avais à faire à lui que pour me dire que mon compte est bancal
La banqueroute, vous avez pas choisi la bonne route
Monsieur j'ai l'GP-Hass mais l'essentiel c'est d'avoir d'bonnes roues

C'était l'époque où y'avait rien donc on faisait tout par nous mêmes

Au loin je peux voir un tsunami de prostituées de haut-rang
Si tu te trompe faut assumer, un jour tout se saura
En Enfer t'auras tout le temps de faire les poses du Kamasutra
Es-tu vraiment français, quand tu possèdes ce morceau de plastique?
Quand tu dis que les femmes sont toutes des putes,
Ma mère en fait-elle partie?
Ça se concurrence dans les biens, New-York, Dubaï ou Pekin
Voilà ce qu'il arrive quand tu donnes du zeille' au Bédouins

A faire l'amour juste par plaisir, on en zappe l'utilité

Je casse la démarche, boite déjà, pourquoi tu veux me balafrer
On est guidé par un bout de chair, qui évacue des impuretés
Comment tu fais si ta maîtresse tombe enceinte de quintuplés?
On se soucie de notre apparence, pour être mieux insouciant en boite
Ces ambiances dont tu dépends, se porte très bien sans oit'
Si tu te coupes de tes racines, tu vas finir par faner
Les jeunes rebelles contre leur daronne ont bien tous fini dépravé
Comment rester sur le chemin droit quand on marche dans les ténèbres?
Prier ne te guidera pas, sur toi on crache quand t'es célèbre
On est prêt à se faire niquer, pour pas passer pour des putes
On a faillit briser nos rêves à se caillasser pour des thunes
La beauté d'une tête peut te faire oublier qu'elle est vide
T'as même retourné la tienne quand elle sourit et que t'étais ivre
Aujourd'hui les gens de valeurs sont ceux que tu vois sur les billets
Rien qu'ils passent de mains en mains, et voient des gens les supplier
Fuck toutes sortes de sentiments, de ses dégâts je suis spectateur
Mais vue le nombre de ses victimes, je respecte la peur
Car si le pouvoir était humain, bah la panique serait sa mère
Certes on aime faire l'amour, mais faut pas niquer ceux qu'on aime

Chasing after the flash of cameras and the spotlight
But now I'm chasing forever, I'm chasing forever, it's all right
Lord knows I've tried, but to no avail, 
Was chasing my tail, so I'm off chasing forever
(Chasing forever)

Once it dawned on me what a song can grant you, I learned to write
In every songbook on every piano, eternal life
So now I'm chasing forever on these scraps of paper, it gets lonely
With what's gone before me so daunting, 
It's haunt or be haunted, I'm off chasing forever
(Chasing forever)
Chasing forever
(Chasing forever)

Always wondering to no avail, 
Wondering if I'm on the right trail

Once I dreamed about being a part of that crazy world
But dreams can taunt you and fly off
 when they want to like a mockingbird, ooh-ooh
So now I'm chasing forever, I'm chasing forever, it's all right

Am I just wandering, lost, chasing forever?

And I'm counting on time I'm counting on time
To heal these wounds to see you through

There was a time when I was always around
Then I was carried along on the sea of dreams I guess
In the pursuit of something better I lost the one thing
That you can never replace and now your face is on my mind

Gone with all her golden opportunities

Once with my Uncle George
He said he'd take me if I was a good boy
That was long ago

And the sweet sweet summers I've known

When everything seems to be wrong

In some hotel near Krefield Germany
Am I doomed to wander every back road

When there's nobody home
And calling where no one can pick up the phone?
For sentimental reasons
I keep on believing
In some faded dream of Diana Sweets
And the sweet sweet summmers I've known

I've been away my darlings I've been away

When a man inquired if he knew the score of the game

Y es todo, todo tan fugaz
Que es una curda, nada más

Llorando mi sermón de vino

Que tiembla, bandoneón
Y busca en el licor que aturda
La curda que al final
Termine la función
Corriéndole un telón
Al corazón

Un poco de recuerdo y sinsabor
Gotea tu rezongo lerdo
Marea tu licor y arrea
La tropilla de la zurda
Al volcar la ultima curda

Cerrame el ventanal, que arrastra el sol
Su lento caracol de sueño
No ves que vengo de un país
Que esta de olvido siempre gris

Tras un retazo del olvido

Ya sé que me hace daño
Yo sé que te lastimó
Llorando mi sermón de vino
Pero es el viejo amor
Que tiembla, bandoneón
Y busca en el licor que aturda
La curda que al final
Termine la función
Corriéndole un telón
Al corazón",La  Última Curda,2007

Face in the strangest of places
Down on the underground station

A starry summer sky,
A laughing you and I, alone.
It all comes back to me now, 
A sea of midnight blue,
Your face uplifted to my own.

And blamed the moon up above,
We didn't know what the glow meant,
We never dreamed it might be love.
It all comes back to me now, 
The love I threw away,
And now each lonely night I pray, 
That it will all come back to me someday.",It All Comes Back to Me Now,1996

Natives kneel in prayer by their caravans.

Old temple bells are calling across the sand.
We'll find our Kismet, answering love's command.

You, Misirlou, are a dream of delight in the night.

Heaven will guide us, Allah will bless our love.",Misirlou,1993

Doch konnt' nicht sehen, dass du an's Ende denkst
Ich lass' dich los, meine Hände brennen
Ich will voran, aber die Bremsen klemmen
Gibst dein Zuhause auf und lernst jetzt fremde Menschen kenn'
Wenn ich das Beste war, warum suchst du ein Besseren?
Du wirst gestresst gehemmt, du hast vergessen denn
Was soll ich denken wenn
Ich dir mein letzten Cent
Gab und meine letztes Hemd trag es und schlaf' jetzt
Oder liegst du auch im Bett getränkt?
Du hast mein Herz getrennt
Ich würde trotzdem nie in Erwägung ziehen zu sagen, du
Bist ein schlechter Mensch'
Ich weiß du gehst dein Weg, stets gepflegt
Ich hoffe du findest diesen Jungen, der deiner Seele fehlt
Und dass du glücklich wirst
Ich wünsch' dir das
Auch wenn's für dein Verschwinden keine Gründe gab

Du warst mein Leben
Oh uh oh
Du warst mein Leben

Zwischen engem Beton, jetzt ist das Ende gekommen
Wir geben auf oder verschwenden unsere Kräfte umsonst
Ich verpacke unsre allerletzten Kämpfe ins Songs
Mit schönen Sätzen habe ich die immer die Ängste genommen
Mal zum Teufel geschert, mal in den Himmel gelobt
Doch das Missen deiner Person, wär' mein sicherer Tod
Ich brauch' noch Zeit um zu vergessen, denn die Risse sind groß
Doch ich glaub ich komm' zurück, wenn deine Stimme mich holt
Ich fühl mich wie auf einer Insel und ich finde kein Boot
Wir versprachen auf Ewig, doch sind die Ringe jetzt los
Jetzt sind die Dinge nun so
Und jetzt fängt der kalte Winter an
Du hast oft den falschen Weg gewählt, doch ich bin mit gegang'
Ich war der Felsen, der dich hält
Und sorgte bei Gewitter, dafür dass der Felsen nicht zerfällt
Ich erkenne mich nicht selbst, gebrochen und zu kalt
Alles gute auf dei'm Weg und ich hoffe du findest Halt

Alles was ich hatte, Schatz warst du
Bevor du gehst, mach' die Türe bitte leise zu
Guck ich werde für dich beten und versuche es zu verstehen

Sezen Aksu,"There's a girl who was raised to believe that love is suffering
She grows up and the man like a father gives her a wedding ring
Now she walks around up constant companion, our resentment, fear and sadness
The lack of laughter turns to cancer, this song is dedicated to her

[Chorus]
The worst disease in the world
It's not cancer, it's not aids
The cure will not be found
By any physicist or scientist
Cause any cure living every single one of us
The worst disease in the world is hate
And the cure for hate is love
Oh love, oh love, oh love

Picture this:
There's a boy who was abused when he was 12 years old
Now guilt lives in the pit of his stomach and even though he's grown
He believes he deserves to be punished, now he lives his life past and reckless
Searching for love, helpless, this song is dedicated to him

[Chorus]

It may seem
When I'm looking at the world through those kind of glasses
I believe that it's so simple but sometimes it looks complicated
God's love is like sunshine not be recognized
The most powerful energy in the universe
And all we have to do is use it

You may think
That there's nothing in the world that you can do but that ain't the truth
The fact of the matter is the battle world begins with you
Be the best person you can be
Pass those values to your family
And when you pray for those you love
Say a prayer for humanity",The Cure,2009

Sto crescendo male oppure forse no
Io capisco male oppure siete voi
Mi stupisco sempre per tutto quanto
Mi incupisco sempre perchè già lo so
Se mi metto a scrivere son già le sei
Spengo la candela, spengo quell’incenso
Spengo la mia testa e tutto ciò che ha dentro
Svengo nel letto e compenso
Svengo nel letto e contemplo
Sì, come se fosse un decesso
Siamo delle pile, delle pile vuote
Venti pile vuote le riverso sopra il blocco note
Fiume in piena, catene di edera sopra la schiena
Sì le mie radici me le tengo appresso
Sono morto così tante volte
Tanto da scordarmi di chi fossi
Devo ritrovar me stesso
Tu c’hai le botte sul telefono
No, mica come me che c’ho le bozze sul telefono (seh)
Tu c’hai le cozze, ma in testa
Ho preso mille strade sì, sì ognuna è diversa
Ora fumo fumo perché Charlie è Brown
Profondo Nettuno, fidi, flusso, Don
Sto connesso, tu stai con l’escort
Dimmi un po’ chi sta sbagliando
Fra’ come stai messo?!

Non sai cosa cerchino da te ma
Non ti importa più di tanto in fondo
Pare il tempo passi e tu ne hai perso troppo forse (ne hai perso troppo forse)
Faccio ‘sti soldi e vado via per un po’
Che Milano cuoce come carta da forno
Tu avevi un cazzo di sogno
Ma per riuscirci hai preso un cazzo di troppo
Ciò che ho visto resta qui con i miei
Tu fai il pitbull su Facebook, qua sul tempo fai schifo
Non mi conosci sono peggio dal vivo
Stai confondendomi per questo sto qui poi
Ciò che ho in tasca me lo spendo e spesso male
È impressionante fuori 
Non c’è un cane però resto uguale con i cazzi miei
Che provo a farci pace
Ora casa dista qualche K ma
Mandarci te resta una passeggiata sai
L’amico sogna un’isola a caso
Non si muove da Milano dal 2004
Qui i più grandi si fan piccoli così
Così non ci finisco
Ho iniziato presto adesso ti finisco
Lascio mi guardino le spalle
Perchè ne ho lasciati tanti dietro

Sono fuori la notte
Rime fra chiavi mi aprono porte
Tipe tranquille diventano porche
Porsche Panamera
La vera natura di un uomo
È riempire di soldi ste borse
Ho anelli e collane
Pago l’affitto per me e per mia madre
Non li sento i commenti di questi, li lascio parlare
Li lascio affogare mentre prendo il volo
E divento un puntino lontano nel cielo che stanno a guardare
Nei messaggi privati lei mi chiama “Papi”
Mentre il mondo odia qua fanno la ola per questi scappati
Chi ha i denti non ha il pane
Io ho i denti coi carati
Dieci chili di stile che stanno copiando oramai tutti quanti
Senza risultati

Ok, pazzo
Fotti Te-Tedua, dovrai farti alla larga
Sì, sulla mia testa c’è messa una taglia
Se non c’interessa non stressar la squadra
Sai che in prigione con un piccione viaggiatore ti scriverò
Mi han detto dalla finestra che il sole ti abbaglia
Ma la guerra persa diventa battaglia
Mario, lei mi chiama sull’iPhone
Hai flow, mai no, ti direi il contrario, hai no 
Non ho pacchetto Sky Box
Zona torna da Skyrock
Avvertimi se sei pronto a perdermi
Perchè i nodi si sciolgono sui pettini
E certi qui fottono i fratelli
Mentre piove un blitz li fottono, ombrelli
Ho coperto del mio crew teste
Mentre di cash provavan febbre

I think he'll do it right, he knows the consequences
The fuck up after that, that shit's true extenses
Every time came we took out, he was the lookout
want to know how much I made?
Just ask one of them niggas to pull the book out
I state this on my word bond, just put him on
In time he'll come up shinin like a mothafuckin Don

My shit'll win you jackpots

I get my service then niggas serve us
A neighborhood infested, that's the good investment
I peeps your operation, let a nigga give me most high
I never been arrested, but expect the unexpected
Wit full pre-meditation, when I run in wit po-nine I freaks the amnesia
Or maybe like I be strung out
Catchin a damn seizure, fuck it I bites my tongue out
Nuttin to lose, cousin your crews a top notch, Lex and Benz
Run through niggas blocks like hop scotch

Everybody shine, as neighborhoods decline

A little bit of rhythm and a lot of soul.

When my eyes beheld an eerie sight
For my monster from the slab began to rise
And suddenly to my surprise

(He did the mash)
They did the monster mash
(The monster mash)
It was a graveyard smash

(They did the mash)
It caught on in a flash
(They did the mash)
They did the monster mash

The zombies were having fun
The party had just begun
The guests included Wolfman
Dracula and his son

The scene was rocking and all were digging the sounds
Igor on chains, backed by his baying hounds
The Coffin Bangers were about to arrive
With their vocal group The Cryptkickers Five

(They played the mash)
They did my monster mash
(The monster mash)
Argh, it was a graveyard smash

(They played the mash)
It caught on in a flash
(They played the mash)
They did the monster mash

Out from his coffin, Drac's voice did ring
Seems he was troubled by just one thing
He opened the lid and he shook his fist and said
Whatever happened to my Transylvania Twist?

(It's now the mash)
It's now the monster mash
(The monster mash)
Argh, it's a graveyard smash

(It's now the mash)
Mmm, you'll catch on in a flash
(It's now the mash)
They did my monster mash

Now everything's cool, Drac's part of the band
And my monster mash is the hit of the land
For you, the living, the mash was meant too
When you get to my door, tell them Boris sent you

(Then you can mash)
To do the monster mash
(The monster mash)
Argh, it's a graveyard smash

(Then you can mash)
Ah, you'll catch on in a flash
(Then you can mash)
Argh, do my monster mash
Argh, that's, argh, good, easy, you all

I thought I'd take a ride,

Was seated by my side;

Misfortune seemed his lot;
He got into a drifted bank,
And we, we got upsot.

the story I must tell

And on my back I fell;
A gent was riding by
In a one-horse open sleigh,
He laughed as there
I sprawling lie,
But quickly drove away.

two-forty as his speed
Hitch him to an open sleigh
And crack! you'll take the lead.

I know you saying you working
But baby boy this feeling ain't right

Fuck that we got enough houses, enough cars
You done bought me enough jewelry
Tired of your shit my nigga you hitting
(You know I be at the studio and shit)
Nigga you lying, who you trying to run that game on?
Who you think I am? I'm not one of these thots you met at Playhouse
(I didn't say that)
I just rode by nigga, you wasn't at Dre house
Parked my shit at Ye house and hopped in the uber
Jayceon stop lying you fucking think I'm stupid
Nah look ain't nobody say that
You ain't complain when I bought that Maybach
Put you in Chanel, your friend Chanelle can't even say that
You wanted to see Rihanna I put you and your friends at the concert
Closet full of Giuseppe[?] you came a long way from Converse
Took you out that concord[?], put you in that Tom Ford
All this arguing I ain't got no time for it
You call my phone like fifty times
Don't do no shit like that
I was just fucking them girls
I was gon' get right back

Spinning around, spinning around
It's the same old, we be going through the same old
Spinning around, spinning around

And that's what the fuck you sleeping on the couch for
I don't give a fuck, thug life I'm an outlaw
And the next bitch ain't nothing but a house call
Scrolling through my iPhone looking for my sidechick
This bitch always flipping pushing buttons like a sidekick
That's when I hop in my Jeep and pull it out the toxic
And while you gone, guess what?
I'll be bouncing on that sidedick, nigga

I guess you thought they stopped making real niggas when they made you
Shit, they stop making them, they stop making them
Guess she thought they stopped making real bitches when they made you
Shit, there's a few in the room and a couple in the Wraith too

Now she's explaining to you
That she's the baddest bitch to ever grace to pair of shoes
And if you are unable to find better you lose
And all this loud chirping that you consider rude
But when food is on the table
We may be arguing like the Cain and we Abel
Then we have some makeup love and we get back stable
Have a little girl I cut the cord from her navel

Where guns spark quicker, on four niggas

Expose rap niggas, take hoes from rap niggas

Used to tap Dre on the shoulder like, ""Nigga come hear this shit""

Don't you stand there and look dumb
Ain't no honor amongst thieves, especially when the hook come
Lives, I done took some

That I’m the type of nigga you could be down for

And be the type of niggas I think I should make a move on

I pull up floors and take them charges with me

The industry soft when Plies getting slammed and shit
I feel like Mayweather in May weather

Got my Timbs on the gas in this grey sweater

Your girl tryna do me, hoochie, groupie
She tryna catch up on a Gucci, baby, no, I’m out like Karrueche
Gave me that BJ so I slid in that bazooki

Shabaam Sahdeeq,"Verse 1:

Light over the city bright
I take flight on a magic carpet visually scanning this metropolis
Graphite and Philly guts through the cats of silly sluts
Move makes straight fakers and the pick pocket 
People setting their wakes too late for them to stop it
Sheeq with the star cheek
Navigate through city streets 
New Jerusalem days mega nights
Wrap like a turban tight 
Some are tall for those who want to spar
Meet up with the caravan 
Sinister voices stand at command

From Flatbush Ave. to Pickadilly Circuit
We work this double edge to split the head of serpents
To the finish which is my death breathe my last breath
I'm on a quest for the answer to this 
Before the seas swallow the continents and we cease to exist
The crown jewel what I possess 
In my heart the emerald four star general flips the art

Hook:

One thousand and one Arabian nights
March through your city at night with torch lights 
March through your city at night with torch lights
March through your city at night with torch lights
March through your city at night with torch lights

Verse 2:

3 wishes granted by the genie in the bottle
Cause I plucked it with my index I thought that it was hollow
Give me world peace and a field of green to blaze
Complicated days some nights got trapped in a maze
Last wish to be immortal 
Won't diss the classic
No melted plastic 
In the attic pure static
I stand within' the depths of the sand of the Sudan
Shabaam put the mic in my hand
Sahdeeq technique open sesame Ali Baba
Type jewels fool I drop on the street
Gems for them
Way to eat for my fleet tryin' to make ends meet
Bring heat with phat tracks eliminate critics on the didick
Talking ka ka your worth nada 
Your style plaga 
Played out like stadas
We hotta 
Leave shit chopped like Benny Honas
I promise maintainin' composure puffin' on the scommas

Hook
Verse 3:

Three wise men bring gifts of hip hop hits
You're vibeless 
Sinister be survivalist
Marvelous sound of the charge of the burgade
Where's my change 
Dues to pay 
Arabian nights on camels start the journey through the desert
Median, Mecca, Style injector
Clash Of The Titans 
Verbally sword fightin'
Enter the gates of the birth city called Pelon
You get peed on 
Makin' moves without your heat on
Don't get it twist
I leave the cypher with split lips Shadeeq style, sick
Call the specialist 
Unwrestle this
Red tape make thick with politics 
But if we don't get somethin' 
Gold or platinum type status
Whenever double S bless the apparatus (echo)

Deadin the negligence

I buy trees all the time, twenties and dimes
You see it in my rhymes frequently, when every other line
There's the reference, the understood preference is that I'm biased
To black shh, black shh to keep me more hype
Seasoned trees get minus disposed right there
Mixed it the ten piece, divide my share
Amongst niggas to overrun it, it's a long climb to the summit
On the lazy afternoon, on the boom oh how I love it
So I does it but imagine if I wasn't, fascinated
Wit the sense of heat that stressin me, fled to frustrated
Ticked off, pissed off, tried to get my dick off
I'm savin a little money, twenty dollars ain't shit
I'm still hungry, and thirsty
You haven't seen the worst of me yet
Since we met it's back to back cigarettes
All my breath hurt, my chest nervous wreckin the session
Imagine Mike Zoot, my brain off drugs, any questions? (yes, yes)

We bring it back to science, wit the finest of Medina
Imagine all the people livin in, maybe I'm just a dreamer

Runnin out of phony acts, be at the underground spots when you need us
Defeat the purpose of the circus, guess who the animals (guess who)
They over-work us and jerk us till we ain't thinkin clearly (come one)
'cause the history we stay weary of various theories
Question evolution and use to pass this lesson through revolution
Ask what not to do (yes), without firepower how is you militant? (yes)
That type shit we don't forget like elephants (never forget)
We stompin black holes in space
If you tore this wicked system down, what would you build in its place?
You gotta plan then we rollin (come on), don't waste my time (please)
There is land that is stolen which is rightfully mine
What if slavery never happened and we was never colonized?
What if governments never lied and white folks apologized?
Or if the environment didn't create the context for the art
When niggas celebrate the death and breakin black mommas hearts
What part, would a MC like me play wit my positive talents play
If there was no negativity to keep the balance?

What if eighty seven never happened?
No innovative hip-hop, no crack kingpin, no park hand-clappin
Damn, one to his chest, the tool jam
He tried to flash a black casket, his son's a bastard
What if the guns was gone soon as your sons was born?
Back to the fisticuffs, only the snakes get bust
>From greed to lust, I seen em all fall face first
Rapidly tappin the frequency and get dissed by chemist
I be exposing the scandalous
Sahdeeq, maniscription is the beef shit
What if the sky fell into the sea?, apocalypse now
Crushin the globe on a quest for your long lost souls
What if I catch the red-eye flight to J-A
And build wit the knotty's on the hill all day?
What if I smacked the grin off your chin
When you say, that the cats on this track don't have nuttin to spray?

[Repeat: x17]
What

What if all world sort of didn't straight up exist?
You wouldn't witness the diabolicness that'll twist
Your head off, and suck the juice out your neck like a sports bottle
Rip a rhyme full throttle, and put the sun in a clutch
If you confused you can use your bad luck for a crutch
So what you if tried to spit my brain's a pit, throw em in
Shake a watchness up and stitch his lips to the opening
I'm hoping above average becomes the new average
Some mediocre rappers are flipped to sub-standard
Demanded, the day da county dazzlely degenerate
Three-oh-five representative the slang that scam
Deep thought wit Shadow Man in Miami we do things
Like sellin rap nigga's hoes to y'all for weddin rings
Wit more mysteries than conspiracies wit change links
We're strangely spittin thoughts by my lonely
After all this close contact you still don't know me

What if? to me is the same question I've asked myself
Exactly twenty years I just blew the penitentiary
Imagine if disease, prejudice didn't exist
Materialistic dreams of purchasing that Lexus would be deaded
What if we remained primitive depended on natural resources?
To live and didn't have technology to abort our kids
How about if there was no rated-are flicks to corrupt our minds?
Or if world wars ain't take place and didn't interrupt our times?
What if this free world shit didn't have us hypnotized?
Or cannibalism was a permanent state of mind?
The death rate, grows faster than we can produce yellow tape
The main suspect is society for committing this mistake
Categorizing everything, I sit back and dig up some more ""what if's""

Don't know what I'd do without you

Common said he used to love her but I love her still
She got a couple of my peoples a house on the hill
And when I'm the club she all I want to hear
My crew all here smell that draw in the air
And it been that way for 'bout 15 years
She took me through pain, sweat and lots of tears
She change like chameleon
One week she got her head wrapped, next week she got Prada on
She took niggaz out the hood
Got 'em eating good, got 'em feeling good, got 'em living good
The first time I met her, she came through the door with Rakim
She had me doing the wop
Hoping that feeling won't stop
Sometime I caught her on a conscious tip
But most times she want to yap about diamonds and whips
But she universal, she got all that with her
Loving her body I couldn't wait to hit her
Got with her had to get her in my clutch and thrust
'cause I love to lust, and lust to love
That's how I feel, she international, shores can't hold her
Sometimes she be in the hand of fake promoters

[Chorus]
That's why I love you
Hip hop I don't know what you do to me
But I love you
I heard some say they lost careers
But all I know is I love you
Hip hop I don't know what you do to me
But I love you
That's hip hop, hip hop, hip hop, hip hop, hip hop

She took me around the world, explored the globe
She took me through highs and lows that's all I know
She ride in the whip with me on full blast
I love it when she boost that bass that fat ass
She flirt with guitar strings
Pianos and things
Been hitting it for years
Not a one night fling
She be in the west with Snoop, the east with Jay
In the south with Ludacris, midwest with Nelly
And the studio's the telly where I bust on her belly
Even though she a ho, I'm a pimp for sho
She got a lot of niggaz pussy whipped
She got lot of kids brainwashed runnin' round with pistols and shit
Pac died in '96 straight freaking that chick
Big went to heaven '97 loving that chick
And I spend a lot of time with her in my room alone
Blaze her back to back like I be doin' them stokes

[Chorus]

If I had to die for her I would, it's love for sho
It's love for rhymes, it's love for beats, it's love for dough
And when I kiss her and hug her I'm off into another zone
Thinkin' 'bout the times with her alone
Thinkin' 'bout the times when we rocked the crowd
Think about the times when we scraped up dimes to get smoke
And I love her just the same whether she Blood or Loc, Vice Lord or Folk
Got me happy like a new leather coat
Got me hype like I'm sniffin' lines of coke
With the mic choked in the studio droppin' em quotes
She got me hooked like fiends with vials of crack
Over and over, back and forth, keep coming back
And she made me cry when she told me Pun and L was gone
Rest in peace but they'll live forever in song, forever in song
Word, word rest in peace

[Chorus in background with S.S. talking over it]

Biggie, Biggie Smalls, rest in peace
Tupac, Tupac Shakur, rest in peace

Big P, Trouble T-Roy, yeah, word
All my fallen soldiers, yeah
God forgive em, got love for this game, got love for this game, uh huh
I don't hate on no forms of hip hop, love it all
Like King Sun once said to me and shit, hip hop like a library
You go in that library, you pick the book that you want, yeah, pick that book
Take that home and you read that, love all kind of forms, flavours
We got the hardcore, we got the commercial, all kind of flavours
We got all that, we got the underground
Go in the library you pick the book you want
No doubt, I love all the flavours, soak that up, soak that up
Love all the shit right here, hip hop

Let's do it...

Slug out, never that, young dude, clever cat
Eat shit, smoke spliffs, get high, reminisce
Innocence, bulletproof, any one, pullin' through
Junior High, do it fly, fuck in grade Summer school
Comin' through, get me drunk, blunted too, every month
Hundred shoes, every son, wanted jewels, never front
Got older, hunger grew, watched most the younger fools
Squat out from the guns they usin', not close to the most of them
Quarter rolls, microphones, one, two, revolution
Sons due, evolution, in a rhyme, ghetto music
In the mind, 'cause I'm movin, in time, intwine
Lines all out of ideas, thoughts expose the road
Painted pictures, mask very clear, like a spear
Fallin' from the atmos, my raps soaked in the pages
Kids I play with, different flavors, instant paper
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Chorus 2X: Killah Priest]
I just breathe, the breathe of life in the mics
Feel my notepads with sites, now, guide you like God did to Israelites
I just breathe, the breathe'll in whole tap
Into my cassettes, fate awakin' you, holdin' in like herb in your chest

[Killah Priest]
I'd rather spit it to it right, then a dome
Like a jewel in a throne, microphone, recite a poem
Hypotone, mellow out the ghetto route, track thugs meadow out
Crack blood devil house, gat slugs, here's your addict
Pushers of conceited habits, took us, look and seen me mad it
Cash laws, blast hog, gas talk in the hood
Black boars, burnin' wood, crack walls turnin' good
Nickel bags, crystal mag, blackout, semi' four
Black watch, ready for war, sasquatch, fantastic four
Blood, strength, through the Clan, wear the colors of our black
Love our mothers, love our dads, sister drug out on that glass
You ain't mad when they ain't sell refer, jump out the window, chasin' Jesus
Hunt me in the garbage, told me, he's a prophet
Used to recite scriptures, and dust, now our skin poppin'
Gems drop in '88, baby cake, first born
I'm crazy late, words long, worst one was '91

[Chorus 2X]

[Killah Priest]
Second son, I'm stressin' young, blesses come, record deal
Kept it real, tess my skills, '96, my third born
Word born, vicious like he held him tight, and mellow hobby
I'm the father and the author, change my name to Masada
First rhyme, search mine, first crime, I stole a ring
Sold it, soak in dreams, felt guilty but the feelin' passed
Learned to put, all my feelings in my past
Kids that had a thinking, took my books and bring
Gave you read, all these laws
Blow coasts, smoke spliff, old flicks, focused
Flip cake, chicks scrape, that's me, thick braids
Swift blade, in the pockets, sick days in the projects
Slick way, I'm the stocking cap, I just got in rap
Family, photo albums, gun, drugs, know the outcome
Book, sweater, picture very, wedding flicks, obituraries
Lyrics that be military, haunt you like a cemetery
Hahahah... breathe in

It might feel good 
It might sound a little somethin' 
But damn the game if it don't mean nothin' 
What is game who got game 
Where's the game in life behind the game behind the game 
I got game 
She's got game 
We got game 
They got game 
He got game 
It might feel good 
Or sound a little somethin'
But fuck the game if it ain't saying nothin' 

If man is the father the son is the center of the earth 
In the middle of the universe 
Then why is this verse coming six times rehearsed 
I don't freestyle much but write 'em like such (word) 
Amongst times controlled by the screen 
What does it all mean all this shit I'm seeing 
Human beings screaming vocal javelins 
Sign of the local nigga unraveling 
My wonderin' got ass wonderin' 
Where Christ is in all this crisis 
Hating Satan never knew what nice is 
Check the paper while I bet on ices 
Keep more than your eye can see and ears can hear 
Year by year all the sense disappears 
Nonsense preserves prayers laced with fear 
Beware the two triple o is near 

There is something happening here 
What it is ain't exactly clear 
There's a man with a gun over there 
Tellin' me I got to beware 
It's time to stop children what's that sound 
Everybody look what's going down 

Thought of that millennium just be killing them 
It scary like lies buried in a library 
When did state pen correct anything 
When piles of us still be catchin' the bus 
When stacks of cash packed in laundromats 
Pay the preachers back where the teachers at 
I ain't even gotta ask it 
Whose underpaid and got fouled at the basket 
I can't blame the envy at who be getting all the benjis 
And taking them grants for granted 
Last I checked pyramids wasn't built like projects 
On them government checks 
Modern day thugs ain't got no guts 
Pardon the expression under governor nuts 
Last time in a church be the last time in a church 
Dead pledge allegiance to CD's and movies 
Leaving reality believing in fantasy 
Bleeding fatalities too many formalities 
Prayers laced with fear 
Beware the two trip zero is here

Bound, together, forever

Verse One:
As I embellish, mentally I nourish
Resuscitate a mindstate that has perished, you shall inherit
his blood I require back, to Earth
we rise out of spiritual darkness, six thousand year curse
The lost disciples, bound, to the midst of the
bottomless pit, trapped behind the gates of the wicked wilderness
I hear the sound of the trumpets, blowing across the heavens
It's calm -- prepare, for the storm, of the seven
Shabazz, the Disciple, the holy, exalter
Condemning those, who sacrificin, babies on the altar
I hear the cries of innocent black babies who are aborted
and unmercifully slaughtered
Loud screams echo, skulls of angry slaves
turning over in their graves
The white sheets are like white flags, you need to wave it
To the soldier, of the Lord, the warrior King David
I come to kill and crucify, those who trick and lie
In the eyes, of the most, high
The pale-face, devil race, caucasoid germ
Grafted, from original, black man's sperm
Thin-blooded weak, grafted-brain punk
Your power's a third of mine, you drunk funky skunk
How dare you use Jesus name to shell your filthy religion
My tongue be the sword, to slash you with precision
The justice system is his, the court'll only acquit him
And eighty-five percent of y'all are going to hell with him
The walls of hell, are closing in, disciples, we rose again

Like lightning, striking, from the East

Unlimited volts, of energy, striking, the enemy

Chorus:
So come on and swing it low, sweet chariot
Pick up your righteous load, and yo then carry it
To a new home, and i-dentity
For my people, death'll be the penalty
Uhh, and for my folks I mad a-love
Keep your eyes on the prize and you'll rise above
And yo Shabazz, make sure you sing it loud enough
Peacein out to the righteous stay rugged and rough
And y'all get on down, come on now get on down
Swing it low sweet chariot... get on down
Come on now get on down, swing it low sweet chariot

Interlude:

The microphone and I'm joinin
Sharpen your sword, we must be aware
Them trick knowledge, they use to de-ce-I've us
You've been plagued with the mental di-se-as-es
You worship false portraits of Je-eh-s-us
The grafted image, of worshipping Ce-as-ea-are

Verse Two:
I hear the snap of my great great grandfather's neck
in a noose, hangin from a fuckin tree whipped-in mentally
abused, visions of great great cousins
Runnin across the field, unarmed
Ran down, and killed
I be the star to dispel the darkness
Cast upon your soul by inhabitants of Mount Caucus
Who praise the dead, and not the true and living
Killed Jesus and said, that he died for their religion

Avenge the innocent blood spilled, the king of israel
The earth was given to his hand to trick it
I'm the mighty lion in the thicket, who be spying on the wicked
In these last days, the projects is like the caves
Facing the 10 plagues, like moses I free slaves
I broke bread in the den of sinners, and done the whore toast
During the plague of sores,
The lamb's blood was on my door post
The sinner gog the pagan, be in the synagogue of satan
Meditating on the prophecies I'm revelating
You feel the threat of armageddon every riot in prison
Son of man was in the tombs, once dead and back risen
Red Hook malitia who be holding down his garrison
You crown the sovereign, cause to god there's no comparison
You better load ya fucking caliber
Screw on ya fucking silencer, and check the year on ya calendar

And ye shall take of the blood
And strike the side and upper post
The whores of babylon got plagues between their legs
Hellfire in the womb, a fetal tomb, contaminated eggs
Abortion is the plague amongst the firstborn, the blackmales
Spare the females, heroin fell just like the plague of hail
Instruments of war echo throughout the projects
Souls drown in the red sea of blood, for material objects
They who worshipped the beast and his mark, went to war and bled
They didn't have the seal of god up in their forehead

Feast on this unleavened bread, and death shall pass you over

Death shall be his penalty

As I embellish, mentally I nourish

bottomless pit, trapped behind the gates of the wicked wilderness

Condemning those, who sacrificin, babies on the altar
I hear the cries of innocent black babies who are aborted
and unmercifully slaughtered
Loud screams echo, skulls of angry slaves
turning over in their graves
The white sheets are like white flags, you need to wave it
To the soldier, of the Lord, the warrior King David
I come to kill and crucify, those who trick and lie
In the eyes, of the most, high
The pale-face, devil race, caucasoid germ
Grafted, from original, black man's sperm
Thin-blooded weak, grafted-brain punk
Your power's a third of mine, you drunk funky skunk
How dare you use Jesus name to shell your filthy religion
My tongue be the sword, to slash you with precision
The justice system is his, the court'll only acquit him
And eighty-five percent of y'all are going to hell with him
The walls of hell, are closing in, disciples, we rose again

Like lightning, striking, from the East

Unlimited volts, of energy, striking, the enemy

So come on and swing it low, sweet chariot
Pick up your righteous load, and yo then carry it
To a new home, and i-dentity
For my people, death'll be the penalty
Uhh, and for my folks I mad a-love
Keep your eyes on the prize and you'll rise above
And yo Shabazz, make sure you sing it loud enough
Peacein out to the righteous stay rugged and rough
And y'all get on down, come on now get on down
Swing it low sweet chariot, get on down
Come on now get on down, swing it low sweet chariot

Lawd, I'm in this culture

Sharpen your sword, we must be aware
Them trick knowledge, they use to deceive us
You've been plagued with the mental diseases
You worship false portraits of Jeehsus
The grafted image, of worshipping Ceasear

I hear the snap of my great great grandfather's neck
in a noose, hangin from a fuckin tree whipped-in mentally
abused, visions of great great cousins
Runnin across the field, unarmed
Ran down, and killed

Cast upon your soul by inhabitants of Mount Caucus
Who praise the dead, and not the true and living

Blasphemy they whisper in the dark of blasting me
Let he who has no sin bust the 1st shot after me
Blasphemy they whisper in the dark of blasting me
Let he who has no sin bust the 1st shot after me
Blasphemy they whisper in the dark of blasting me
Let he who has no sin bust the 1st shot after me
Blasphemy they whisper in the dark of blasting me
Let he who has no sin bust the 1st shot after me

[Verse One]
Yo, if there's a heaven in the afterlife, it's crowded in the cosmos
Only God knows, in my physical dwells Allah's ghost
Many mortals embody the spirit of diablo's
Of all the plagues in the ghetto
We're either dead or behind bars most
Unlike them lost souls, I chose the right path at my crossroad
My life is like the scripture that was foretold
As days pass I uphold the faith
Praying God don't close the gate
This life is deep, but I could hold the weight
March in my Jehovah souljah state
Where shaytan waits pon'
God's path wanting my soul as he lie in wait
Control the population with guns, drugs, diseases
Got my people acting evil, strung out on needles waiting for Jesus
Once made in the image of God who turned savages
Get murdered by the government gang with silver badges
I feel them assembling in the dark plotting to assail
I hear the banging, from them fastening my cross to the ground with nails

[Chorus]

[Verse Two]
I seek refuge from Allah from the one who is ecursive
If the devil didn't exist, then I wouldn't have a purpose
The prophecy must be fulfilled
See I already died my first death
Just cause a man is breathing, doesn't mean he has the breath
The angel of death be calling spirits out the physical
Take a look through the eyes of a disciple, shit is visual
Allah sharpened my peripheral
Blessed me with the gift of prophecy
So I can see the wickedness you hid in you
Raised amongst murderers and criminals, once a master crook
I already know what you thinking
I used to give victims the same look
Let he who has no sin cast the first stone
Cause when my peoples send you to me
You'll be my slave in the kingdom
Death is only but a breath away
I pray I don't get left astray
Many are they who seek to slay me like prey
I hear them whispering in the dark, plotting to assail
I hear them fastening my cross to the ground with nails",Blasphemy,2003

Bump you, squeeze first I'ma haunt you

Dog tail up ya ass when I confront you, faggot I'ma hunt you

Have them write their verses over tryna battle me
And nigga that'll be a fatal tragedy
Shit, you better off shooting or stabbing me
than stepping in this fucking rap ring and jab with me
Get ya weight up motherfucker, wear the belt and the crown
Frozen niggaz like a dirty gat, I'm melting them down

Shabazz the Disciple,"[Verse One]
Yo! Shorty was used to being jiggy
But then he fell off and did a bid
For spanking this kid up in the city
Sitting pretty, pimping an ac and kept a stack on him
Pulled over one night and his man stashed cracks on him
See he was wanted and his fam started flipping on him
His mind was haunted cause allah put a whipping on him
Shorty was feared and respected
Known for slapping niggaz and stripping them
Make them walk around the projects but naked
Nigga remind me of the goodfellas
But deep down his snake mans wanted to knock him off
Cause they was jealous
They made a deal and got him bagged, shit was foul
He copped to manslaughter
Cause he knew he would've blew the trial
Niggaz was skeeming all along and got acquitted on him
His girl and his man broke in the safe and they shitted on him
And now they're living the fast life and he's hitting that ass right
And got her hooked to the glass pipe

[Chorus - repeat 2X]
The game never change, only the players
While some inherit castles and thrones
Some end up death bed layers
Victims of the system and stripped mentally
Hit with 25 to life or the death penalty

[Verse Two]
6 months without a visit now he's getting worried
Up north scraping and yanking niggaz for their commissary
Been down for 5, came home and still wanted that nigga dead
Got on his feet and put rewards out on that nigga head
Running 2 spots, shit was hot so he fled out of state
Cause he's out on parole and his p.o's dying to violate
His world is narrow he's paro cause he's on the run
Walking in the building
With his back against the door holding his gun
One in the pipe ready to spank something
Cutting grams with his man
Holding the blade ready to shank something
See now he's getting major money
Throwing bricks and the niggaz in his clique started acting funny
He started sniffing getting high off his own supply
Shorty was slipping and his ass was about to die
Pimped his workers with high heels and a skirt
Now they're scheming to put his 10% ass in the dirt

[Chorus]

[Verse Three]
He worked his way up from grinding
And scraping hand to hand on the block
And slinging rocks on consignment
He got plugged in, now he's juggling bricks and moving weight
And bubbling gats and trafficking big 8's out of the state
Faked his death and ducked the feds
But little did he know
That his ex had put a price out on his fucking head
One night she plugged him to a pick up
He's supposed to pick a brick up
She led him right into a fucking stick up
His world was spinning fast, the walls of hell were closing in
Angel of death was on his ass, his adversaries rose again
100 grand in the trunk to cop the crystal
He was sleep, that nigga in the back seat had packed a pistol
He put 2 in his kangol and twisted his wig backwards
Yanked the suitcase out the trunk, fucking snake bastard!
Left him slumped over the wheel with his wig peeled
Brains on the dashboard and blood all on the windshield
I watched him lay on his deathbed with a swollen head
Waiting for his heart to stop, cause he was brain dead
Angel of death was waiting by his bed side
He jerked his arm the next morning
And then a tear ran down his left eye
6 men carried his coffin, put him 6 feet in the ground
while I stood, 6 feet over in a black suit looking down
Thinking, why was I chose to survive and bear these memories
Fucking with that dirty game, death is always the penalty!!!!

Word! Yo R.I.P. my brother Rah, Bumpy, Junior, Herb
Know what I'm saying, just, Jeffrey, my man Stevo
They all were shot in the head!!

Hip pop, they tap dance to sell a mil
While real emcees with skills don't got a deal
It's industry conspiracy to make us savage
Take off ya clothes to go gold, sell ya soul to live lavish

[Verse One]
It seems every man want to be a pop star
It's obvious to me that you forgot who you are
These labels will have you wearing high heels and a bra
Cut the roots to ya tree and watch ya empire fall
Now hip hop is a tree, and trees live by their roots
All the roots live underground, water down me no salute!
They pimping the culture, the same vulture who stole ya agriculture
My vocab is ultra, I insult ya or nurture ya sculpture
It's like to get a record deal, you gotta get naked and kneel
Labels ain't checking for skills no more, they want sex appeal
No publishing checks in the mail
Don't you know when you become a slave to money
That's when you destined to fail
You swallowing so you can sell a million records
On magazine front covers butt naked
Used to be a queen who was highly respected
Now when I listen to ya album, shit get ejected
I didn't get the album out, somebody cock blocked it
In 99 I smacked the blackball right in the side pocket
When I drop it take ya plaque to the pawn shop and hock it
I'm taking all y'all money this year, extorting ya profit
y'all got greedy and went commercial
And ya label's still jerking you
I'm starving all y'all niggaz this year, take it personal

[Chorus]

[Verse Two]
Fuck riding in limos nigga copyright ya demos
Cause they shiesty, labels are shiesty
Ya manager's stroking you, saying shows are promotional
Cause they shiesty, niggaz are shiesty
Stupid, the main niggaz who helped you get on
The first niggaz you shit on
You'll realize who love you when all ya money's giddone
They're smiling in ya face
Cause right now you're putting cake on their plate
Them the same niggaz that's scheming on ya safe - word!
It's the ones that sniff coke witcha, from broke to richer
Now they want to cut ya throat and come and getcha
Ya fake acapellas can't really rock a farvela crowd
Ya head is full of helium, you floating in the clouds
On stage fronting like the solo type
Cloned my hip hop chromosomes, deep down you know Shabazz ya prototype
Don't even know how to hold the mic, trippin over the cables
Mumbling and stumbling into the turntables
Tap dancing, juggling, shuffling their feet smiling
The type of niggaz I be snuffing while their freestyling
Whether you're gold or you're platinum, I'm robbing and gatting them
And slapping them with an aluminum bat and busting a cap in them
Duct taping and gagging them, make 'em deep throat the magnum
Trapping them in alleys, where we're beating stomping and dragging them
Fuck selling my soul for that mansion and a yacht
I'd rather make salat and scrape the bottom of the pot
Real soldiers survive with 3 hots and a cot
You can't take them riches in the ground when you rot
Must have forgot, ya fans bought you to that altitude
And now you left them astray, ego got you confused
Son I be browsing, they tryna trap us all in public housing
How niggaz classic albums only sell 200 thousand
Labels be running sound scams on ya cream
That makes niggaz susceptible on going mainstream, they pulling ya strings
With marketing schemes extorting the fiends
They ain't gonna never tell you how many records you sold seen
Peace to all emcees staying true to their root
Don't sell their soul for the loot
And planting seeds in the youth and fuck the

We came a long way up from fighting court cases
Running the streets dirty with guns on our waists
Tryna be a man feed a fam and build a basis
Treaded the sandhills, hip hop is my oasis

[Verse One]
It all began up in 100 dwight
When my uncle younganutt handed me my first mic
At 13 years old, I realized it was a road
And at the end I would win lots of pots of gold
Never lost the flame, never divorced the game
Everybody who know me know I paid the cost for fame
To be a billionaire, the god struggled for years
Some nights I shed tears when I said my prayers
Been shot at a lot of times for slinging nickels and dimes
On the road to the riches that was paved with crime
I was sought of caught in between the streets and a mic
Niggaz never touched the knuckles
Cause they knew I could fight
Red Hook was one projects easy to get killed in
My mother always told me stay from underneath them buildings
I scrambled all my life, finally I found my purpose
I'ma be a disciple to hip hop long as the earth twist

[Chorus]

[Verse Two]
My mother and Mrs. Irene had me, Klief, and Elliot sing
+Rappers Delight+ by the Sugarhill Gang, at her baby shower
Now I realize that's what gave me power
At 8 years old that was my first hip hop encounter
Then I went on playing keyboards with adam ellis
Only 12 but we could play whatever people tell us
In the halls of Red Hook, I was the king of the beat box
Back when me and Mr. Ice walked around singing rock box
He was the nicest emcee in the hook on Red Hook day
When niggaz saw us behind the ropes they were shook
We feint to lace the mic and young always allowed us
Used to go from block to block to battle
And people would crowd us
On staircases with rah and sha the ganja would spark me
I was fiending to battle dougie fresh, buff and biz markie
Was always a ghetto star and highly respected
Lashawna always asked me when I'm gonna make a record
People seen something in me I didn't see in myself
Shit I was only having fun, niggaz loved how it felt
My 2 daughters denysha, yay-yay, my whole family
I dedicate this to y'all for believing in me

[Chorus]

[Verse Three]
I come from humble beginnings, a project apartment
7 kids on 2 beds, the rest on the carpet
My mother raised her brothers and sisters on welfare
As well as her own kids, and she didn't have any healthcare
Now we tryna get houses with cars in garages
Manage twa's, bubble hot tub massages
Laughing all the way to the bank with my goddess
Tryna put gold bars in the safe, platinum artist
No longer settling for the crumbs on the cake
No more embezzling or we running from jake
Shopping sprees copping threes rocking designer things
No more selling poppy seeds or hocking diamond rings
Celebration of life, everyday's like christmas
Taking my baby girls on trips, and fulfilling their gift list
Sending my ol' earth on vacation on the love boat
After a cruise around the world she comes home to a fur coat
Relax with black sand all up between her toes on beaches
Enjoying the breeze from palm trees, sipping crushed peaches
Shit, back in the days the only island niggaz been on was rikers
Doing pushups with them lifers!

[Chorus]",Oasis,2003
Shabazz the Disciple,"[Verse One]
Yo it was all a dream, me and my brothers shakim and rahkeem
Up black crib puffin l's seeing ourselves on the screen
Our pictures in a magazine, we up in a limousine
In suede bally's, silk shirts and jeans with the Gucci seams
I beat boxed and niggaz flow till we was dizzy
My manager Mo, Chuck, Fresh, G-Money, Wil, Louie and Wizzy
Those were my favorite days when I turn back the page
And everyday we did a show, the staircase was the stage
And yo the name of the group: it was ""RAHSHASHA""
Whoever thought that hip hop would make it this far
At 16 we did our first real show at the miccio
My mother believed in us, she shot our first video
We would go to my uncle young's house every sunday
He let us do our thang, we had a hot tape on monday
I love them both for that, they always had my back
They made me who I am today, I see that when I look back
Red Hook day gave me the confidence to do what I do
Mr. Gus, Stephen Moore, 9-2 Crash Crew
RZA seen what it took the world time to see
I dedicate this to y'all for inspiring me come on!

Talk to me y'all aha! aha! it's Red Hook day y'all
Talk to me y'all!

[Verse Two]
Hip-Hop is my religion son, music and fashion
Since I was a lil nigga yo, I do this with passion
It took me around the world from brazil to paris
Even on channel 2 news with my man reggie harris
Crime saga nominated soul train '96
Even though I do it son, I'm still a fan of this shit
When ""BDP"" said didididadiday
KRS dissed Marley Marl, Shan and Shante
And Stetsasonic had the Brooklyn anthem
We would rush a house party mob deep and vamp them
I slammed the mic when I'm done and kicked a hole in the speaker
When Rakim told Big Daddy Kane +Follow the Leader+
When Slick and Doug E. them said +La-Di-Da-Di+
When trench coats would hide the shottie to stick up the party
We was forever on that Brooklyn bullshit
My new projects posse was quick to pull shit
And fuck a fair one, you got ya head snuffed and stomped in
Back when that nigga Tim Dog made +Fuck Compton+
+Hey Young World+ is my all time favorite
Even now I still sing it every time when I play it
I dedicate this to y'all for inspiring me
And all my fans around the world whose admiring me
I had the vision all my life son, I came a long way
And now the whole world's invited
I welcome y'all to Red Hook day!

[Verse Three]
My Uncle Cliff and Calvin Klein always knew I had the vision in mind
And one day it'll be my time to shine
Back in 1989 they bought me up to 105.9
They played my shit and it lit up the phone lines
Ladies and gentlemen, you're about to see
A past time hobby about to be
Taken to the cinema screens and BET
And be blazin ON WQHT and MTV
Shit, I sacrificed my whole life for this
Everyday I roll the dice and pray to Christ for this, for real!
I sacrifice my whole life for this
Everyday I roll the dice and pray to Christ for this
Def Jam was always my favorite label
Since the days I rocked ""2 TONE"" leather pants and a gold cable
And +Krush Groove+ showed me dreams come true
All a nigga need is passion to follow' 'em through
I love Russell Simmons he inspire me to hustle and keep swimming
And never give up the struggle, focus on winning
This year I'ma do my thang, word to ""RAH"" who hovers me
I'll love +Wu-Tang Forever+, cause the RZA discovered me

It's what have black people under pressure
Just because we don't stick together

Black man know yourself before your back is against the wall
Ten time rise, and ten time fall
Oh, Shabba is stronger then deh great China wall

Mek up mi mind to teach the youngster
Teach the youth dem like a teacher

Tell Shabba to stop being vulgar
Change up mi style and ah change mi order
Have the lyrics now to teach the youngster

Brasil, Jamaica
Sou brasileiro, sou muito feliz
Ouvi seu nome muito além de Paris
Saímos pra tocar, fomos pro lado de lã
América, Europa, de que tanto ouvi falar.
Ouvi muitas histõrias, ""Mundo novo é aqui""
Terra das maravilhas, Disneylandia e Mickey Mouse
Tocar com Ziggy Marley em Miami foi legal
Todas as potências do reggae mundial, então

E Jimmy Cliff na baixada uma hora nos falou
Que na Jamaica em Montego Bay
Numa favela ele viu nascer um rei
Sua mensagem que muito nos marcou
""Pois o reggae quando bate você
Nunca sente dor""
Assim dizia o rei que o mundo encantou
Assim dizia o rei que ao mundo provou
Que a liberdade e a sapiência
A sapiência
São peças chaves pra maior inteligência

Um grande sonho a se realizar
Reggae, Brasil, estou louco pra tocar

Have you ever popped champagne on a plane
While getting' some brain
Whipped it out, she said ""I never seen snakes on a plane""
Whether you broke or rich you gotta get biz
Having' money's the everything that having' it is
I was splurging' on trizz
But when I get my card back activated
I'm back to Vegas cause
I always had a passion for flashing' before I had it
I close my eyes and imagine, the good life

Is the good life better than the life I live
When I thought that I was gonna go crazy
And now my grandmamma ain't the only girl calling me baby
And if you feeling' me now then put your hands up in the sky

Still I can't explain it
And that's who we are
I wouldn't try to change a thing
We missed the point
But didn't dodge the scars
See I've learned my lesson
I'm all right so far

Lost in your outer space
See that I found my place
I want to be where you are
I

And that's beautiful
That's beautiful
And that's the beauty
Of beautiful

Why won't you just stay the night over now
You need to escape but you don't know how
I want you to stay as free as you are
I want you right now

Feels like I'm running in place
You put the sun on my face
While I'm shooting down stars

And I can't wait for the day 
When the real you comes out
It's in your eyes and I see 
That's it's bound to come out
You say you know what you feel 
But the words all come out wrong 
Like excuses you made up 
Why you won't come out
You bite your tongue

The truth might come out",Beautiful,1999
Shack,"People tell me they wake up everyday wondering if they'll be here tomorrow.
I say live for today.
Cause everything you have is just borrowed.

Things stay the same are you afraid to ask why?
Fight to live! or are you waiting to die?

We live on, reaping what we sow
Terror from the darkness of our minds
The self-destruction of mankind

Shad,"I try to hold some hope in my heart for these African youths
Coming up where I'm from many traps to elude
Surrounded by mostly white and affluent dudes
And somehow, you expected to have

Mastered this smooth, swagger and move
With the right walk, the right talk, fashion and crews
Souls subtly attacked and abused
And what's funny's being black wasn't cool

Where I'm from 'til suddenly
You started hearing rap in the school
Hallways admist this madness I grew
With knack for amusing through this little skill

For rappin' at dudes an' we all like to laugh at the truth
But when you young and same facts
Pertain to who you rappin' 'em to
Well, I opted not to bring that to the booth

But after a while, it sort of starts naggin' at you
The crazed infatuation with blackness
That trash that gets viewed and the fact that
The tube only showed blacks actin' the fool and I was watching

Saturated with negative images and a limited range of
Possibilities is strange

And it's sad 'cause that naturally do
Sort of condition your mind and over time
That's what's attractive to you
So young blacks don't see themselves in

Scholastic pursuits or the more practical routes
It's makin' tracks or it's hoops or God-forbid movin' packs for the loot
Even with this music we so limited, it's rap or produce
And that narrow conception of what's black isn't true

Of course, still we feel forced to adapt to this view
Like there's something that you're havin' to prove
Now add that to the slew of justification the capitalists use
For the new blaxploitation many actions excused

In the name of getting cash, that's adversely impactin' our youth
With mental slavery, the shackles is loose
And it's hard to cut chains when they attached at the roots
So what the new black activists do

For our freedom is just being them
Do what you're passionate to
Not confined by a sense that you have to disprove
Any stereotypes, so-called facts to refute

Or match any image of blackness
They've established as true
Perhaps we'll break through the glass ceilings
Shatter the roof and emerge

From these boxes that they have us in cooped
And grow to smash the bold that they casted of you
I'll keep watching

Hear the pistol blast then I hit the track
Running like a Kenyan cause I’m Kenyan (ask my mama)
Yeah I’m running like a Kenyan see I’m running like Obama
On that ticket, this is wicked as that Broadway play with the witches in it
Tell me who’s the sickest, kid I’m putting on a clinic: listen
You don’t know about really touching the lyrics
So touching when I’m touching on any subject I’m fearless
They can’t stomach it, I’m loving it munching nuggets in Paris
See the throne? That’s my zone don’t let me even get near it
Please, I’m ahead of my time, wait, now I’m ahead of the times
Sped up ahead of the beat, speaking of time whenever I head to the meet
I’m always ahead of the heat, head of my class egg head with glasses
Leaving these heads with a classic, now let me just head to the back

You refined and you all slick, talking français some
“Je suis dining with chopsticks”
You’re sly dog, and you’re from Africa right?
That’s amazing. That’s really great, fascinating
See I got fans that say “Oh hey Shad, I hate rap but I like you,”
Well I hate that, but I like you at least I like that you
Like me so I won’t spite you, it’s not your fault you’re a white dude
Likes white music I like too, just don’t be surprised by my IQ
Please, it's like back in high school they said “highbrow”
I said, “hi who?” That Shakespeare, that’s a haiku
I like the high road so I was like dude that’s basic
That’s like crude but you’re old placed to my iTunes
Use your common sense, matter fact use Common Sense
For that matter use Ice Cube, don’t think that we nice too

And we ain't even talkin' 'bout my rap track, nigga
I'm paid, fresh out the bank
I make that lil' money look less than you think
Yeah you think you got more, ain't as much as you think
When you see than I am everything that you ain't

Sucka ass nigga, don't deal with him

They keep it one hunnid, can't lie to my homies
Eatin' on turkey now, no b-bologna
Still gainin' weight and we 'bout to go tourin'
We really rich niggas, we hop in the foreign
Nigga you play and get shot by the mornin'
Spray a whole hundred shots with no warnin'
Bales and them scales, before rap I was rich
Still hit them blocks, all up in the dead end
This a cold world, I've lost so many friends
So many fakes, I don't want no more friends
Stack all this money and count all the yams
Used to move weight and ain't talkin' 'bout no gem
Rubber band racks by the ten now
Used to be broke, went from bucket to Benz

Don't you diss, speak on my name
I'm the same nigga, ain't shit changed
Never got far with the pussy nigga thing
No we are not the same, stay in your lane
These niggas leasin' their rings, it ain't what you think

Make a pussy nigga park my car
All these pussy niggas try to sound like me
Shit, they won't get too far

Ooh, mil', hundo
Yellow, purp, that drank though
Pull up on the set with a bitch so bad
Every nigga want her back though

Shad K,"It's not a solid, not a soft thing, to pull the wool up like a smoke screen
Nobody does it like a prophet, it's gone before you know you lost it
There are reasons you keep your hands tied, there's certain things you shouldn't have tried
So if you gotta tell me something, you better go from the beginning

We all forget to sleep, and crash at someone's feet
Everybody skips a beat
We let the chances pass, the few we held so fast
Everybody breaks a glass

And here I'm standing in the middle, not just a little but a hill full
Wondering how I got a head cold, wishing I didn't know what I know
It's never been about the money, we're worthy or we are not worthy
However much you got on your plate, you're as good as you reciprocate

We all pretend to keep our tongue out of our cheek
Everyone's the fool they seek
We all go off the track, and feel for our way back
Everybody breaks a glass
Everybody breaks a glass

Shook
Scared to look
At peers when they peer back
It's weird how we fear that

It's weird how we wear masks
It appears that we fear our own tears
More than tear gas
My team's struggling in years past

Looking to draft beers
To bring cheers back
But when the drinking game's finished
No Guinness just a clear glass

Seeing our real image mirrored back
The places that we go to cope
It's so strange
When we're older folks

It don't change
Trying to hang, we don't know the ropes
When we fall, we got more than our shoulders broke
It's no game

It's why we overdose on cocaine
Get our brains comatose, there's no blame
If you've ever know shame
Known pain

Known days when it really don't feel okay

Somewhere perfection lies, but not for you and I
Everybody trips some time
When cities fall like shacks, walls eventually crack

Notte thriller, Michael Jackson (sì)

Mentre parlo con due cagne, San Francesco
Io sono il tipo che si sente Yoda
In quei posti pieni, ma solo di gente vuota (se)
Che ti dice che il treno passerà una volta sola
Quando il giorno dopo passerà alla stessa ora (qui)
Pare sia normale fare male alle persone care pur di arrivare a fare successo (sì)
Tu sei così infame che se fossi bipolare parleresti male pure di te stesso

Mi voleva fare, ma s'è fatta solo i bodyguard

두 번째는 대중들의 작은 집중 뿐
세 네 번째 부터
이 썩은 scene의 귀중품
새빨간 19금 딱지가 붙었지만

음악은 나의 길
심의실에서 평가 불능한 appeal
득과 실 벌써 decade
Still mic를 check 해
Like JK형 밝은 미래 in my arms
실낱 꿈 풍파와 입맞춤
가사를 쓸 때마다
혼자가 아니야 in my room
내게 숨 같던
친구들의 반이 하늘나라
내가 대신 꾸는 꿈 속에서
편히 잠을 자라
맺힌 내 땀을 봐라
I\'m a damn 괴물
Made an independent label
cause I won\'t ever settle

처음엔 지루한
학창 시절을 열 창이었다
모든 게 좋아 고통은 먼 산이었다
부모는 답이 없다
친구는 관심 없다며
모두가 벽을 만들고서
난 남이었다
몇 해간 수돗물이 밥이라도
사방에 짙은 안개뿐인 반 지하도
견디고 버티다 보니 뭐 괜찮았어
그래도 택시 타는 녀석은
좀 배 아팠어
하나 둘 배고픔에 떠나갈 때
나 역시 고민했었지만
결과는 반대
하나 둘 팬들이 더 쌓여갈 때
음악과 맘은 같았지만
뭘 하든 깠네
그래도 뭐 어쩌겠어
잡초 같은 걸
아직도 빛나는 그 애들처럼
산소 같은 걸
그냥 좀비처럼 걸어 세상을 얻다

Shade,"Non FOTTI CON FDP!
Mi chiedi come faccio io che minchia ne so
Faccio i pezzi rap, quelli hardcore, quelli dance, quelli low
Mi senti rappare dici ""minchia che flow""
Di un'altra razza discendo dalla scimmia che c'ho

Da quando faccio gli extra, tutti pronti a correre
Non spaccio, ma a questi rapper gli do la polvere
Io ascolto i tuoi pezzi e muoio dal ridere
Tu ascolti i miei pezzi e muori dal rodere

Ah, sti babbi che parlano dei miei testi
E parlano di contenuti come se non ce li avessi
Poi fanno soltanto foto nudi davanti agli specchi
Vi entro sulla traccia a voi vi casca la faccia dai selfie

Nei pezzi fai il duro dal vivo sei soffice
Nei palazzoni ci torno da ospite
A furia di dare le perle anche ai porci
Finisce che i porci poi sembrano ostriche
T'abbasso la cresta fra, ti faccio le treccine giù
Ho visualizzato la tua fine hai le freccine blu

Fine live, asciugamano, vuoi freestyle?
Asciugameno
E se lo faccio spero che ne chiuda una almeno
Fine live, asciugamano, vuoi freestyle?
Asciugameno

Ogni volta che lo chiedi io mi chiedo:
""Se i rapper fossero noi""
Che facciamo gli extrabeat pure ordinando una pizza
Se i rapper fossero noi
Che la tipa se s'incazza fra non ci lascia ci dissa!

Se i rapper fossero, fossero rapper
Se i rapper fossero rapper
Se i rapper fossero, fossero rapper
Se i rapper fossero rapper come noi

Sputo, cago, stupro mentre rappo multitask
Fatti due domande sceme e scemo dopo chiudi Ask
Qui mi pressa-no, ma quale ""Web Star"" bro
Ti schizzo in faccia mentre guardi il video web-cumshot

Quante cose dette su di me, cose stupide
Ultimamente chiunque si sente giudice, più umiltè
Frate fatti meno cessi e più bidet
La cover del tuo cell ha le orecchie, man, e le usa piu di te

Tra la morte e amici la prima tutta la vita
Non mi ascolto la tua merda sennò mi spunta la figa
Vuoi sfidarmi col freestyle? Ma farlo in chat non è una sfida
Sono tutte un po' suicide, ma poi nessuna si suicida

Hai fatto due foto non sei una modella
Io odio la donna moderna
Se metto le hogan e pesto una merda
Penso che la scarpa diventi più bella

Non siete creativi, siete cretini
Incredibile che vi crediate anche divi
Mi senti rappare
Mi chiedi respiri
Svolto la mia vita mica i risvoltini!

Per un po' di soldi vendi il culo, music bisex
Non è il successo che mi da alla testa 
È la mia testa che mi da il successo, che triste

Ti affetto Shadeadpool uno in meno

Non esco più con lei, ma esco col mio disco
Io non ho tutti fan che ha Dio forse perché io esisto
Ogni rapper ha la sua linea d'abbigliamento
Dovrei fare più caso all'abbinamento
Ma non saprei che mettermi perché dentro l'armadio 
Ho così tanti scheletri che non ci stanno nemmeno i vestiti dentro
Che siano views o money tutti vogliono fare il milione
Vedi solo i soldi, eurovisione
Non faccio giochi di parole per fottere le persone
Gioco con le parole me ne fotto delle persone
Parli di big money, ma hai solo le big mani, un abbraccio Gianni
Ogni anno compio sedici anni, non sai se amarmi o linciarmi
Se mi sfidi rischi come col tuo account
Se lo lasci aperto senza fare Logout

E toccare la tua foto sopra il touch screen
Mi dà quasi l'illusione di toccarti
E non ho soldi quindi se provo a chiamarti
Il mio operatore mi manda tipo dieci messaggi

È troppo tardi amore
Sei come il mio navigatore
Che mi dice ""gira a destra""
Quando ormai sono già altrove

Ho il cuore cosi freddo che 
Se lo buttassi dentro a un frullatore
Uscirebbe frozen
Gli altri sentono il bisogno di dire che sono felici

Bevono perché li fa sentire più ricchi
Li fa sentire più fighi
Li fa sentire più re
Scemo io che bevo solo per sentire più te

E mi dicevi che dovevo darmi un ruolo
E mi dicevi che sono troppo buono
E ora mi chiedi come mai ti chiamo solo
Il fine settimana

Odio l'alcol ma fammi un'altro shot
Così trovo il coraggio che non ho
Altrimenti non ti scriverò
Il fine settimana

Sono talmente fatto che quando leggi che scrivo 
Pensi sia un analfabeta
È andata male visto che oggi 
Quando scrivi cose a caso di solito ti chiamano poeta

Avevi lo sguardo sullo smartphone 
E ti sei persa il momento in cui è caduta la cometa
Speriamo che Kepler sia abitabile 
Magari lì non sono io il peggiore sul pianeta

E mi dicevi che dovevo darmi un ruolo
E mi dicevi che sono troppo buono
E ora mi chiedi come mai ti chiamo solo
Il fine settimana

Odio l'alcol ma fammi un'altro shot
Così trovo il coraggio che non ho
Altrimenti non ti scriverò

Shade,"Silenzio silenzio in aula per favore zitti
Anche lei signor Shade si alzi 
Mi guardi negli occhi alzi quello sguardo signor Shade 
Non mi commuove lo sa? 
Si rende conto che quella ragazzina era minorenne? 
E lo sa che il padre è incazzato nero eh?
E come la mettiamo signor Shade come la mettiamo 
Allora signorina prego mi dica
Esattamente il punto dove il rapper l'ha toccata
Shade

Guardi il mio profilo e dici ""sembri proprio fico
Sei il mio rapper preferito con il rap tu sei un prodigio""
Con queste minorenni lo sai cosa ho capito
Che essere pro fica non è molto proficuo
L'amore non ha eta' media
Ti atteggi da terza età quando hai l'età da terza media
A recitare il ruolo della persona seria
Mi sento più Wikipedo che la tua Wikipedia
Pensare che dalle foto sembravi molto più grande
Non c'era scritto Retrica ma c'era scritto Brazzers
Hai un seno gigante mi ripeti che mi vuoi

Io non ti avrei messo manco un mi piace col senno di poi
Nemmeno mi conosci ma oramai io ti conosco
Da quante foto posti sei famosa in ogni posto
Sei una favola e baci anche i rospi
Ma per loro sei la bella addormentata ed io sono Bill Cosby

Più guardavo le tue foto più sembravi una MILF
E invece sono innamorato di una seventeen
E forse sono io che sbaglio a farmi un po' troppi film
Sei la mia seventeen sono il tuo seventeen idol
Se serve ti apro sono il tuo seventeen idol
Mi soffocherei nelle tue calze di nylon
Ti metto così tanti cuori quando ti liko
Che potrei fare I trapianti di cuore con l'iphone
A saperlo non ti facevo salire in auto
Facevi discorsi scemi alzavo l'audio e la radio
Copriva cosa dicevi e ora che sono arrestato
Quando entro gli altri detenuti fanno l'applauso
Ti avvicini e poi mi dici ""Bella festa
Non ci sto provando mica"" si bella questa
È peggio di tutte le altre insieme quando pensa
Mi scrive cosi tanto che mi viene il mail di testa

Spiegalo tu al giudice che magari mi aiuta
Che non t'ho mai toccata è stata una toccata e fuga
Che l'arancione non mi dona se mi metto in tuta
Poi guarda che foto metti chiunque t'ha vista nuda
Più guardavo le tue foto più sembravi una MILF
E invece sono innamorato di una seventeen
E forse sono io che sbaglio a farmi un po' troppi film
Sei la mia seventeen sono il tuo seventeen idol
Sei la mia seventeen sono il tuo seventeen

Sei la mia seventeen sono il tuo seventeen
Sei la mia seventeen sono il tuo seventeen
Sei la mia seventeen sono il tuo seventeen
Sei la mia seventeen sono il tuo seventeen

Più guardavo le tue foto più sembravi una MILF
E invece sono innamorato di una seventeen
E forse sono io che sbaglio a farmi un po' troppi film
Sei la mia seventeen sono il tuo seventeen idol
Finitela di cantare questa canzone di merda basta
È una cosa gravissima Shade
La condanno a 6 mesi di lavori socialmente utili 
Caro Shade avvicinati ti farò pulire
Così tanti bagni per le strade ascoltami bene 
Che quando andrai al cesso ascoltami bene 
Sarà la merda a sentire puzza di Shade",Seventeen Idol,2016
Shade,"Non ti chiedo più quando ritorni, ma ti chiedo quanto rimani
Se litighiamo è la guerra dei mondi per quanto siamo lontani
Da quando è finita mi sembra passata una vita
Mi hai quasi raggiunto, siam quasi coetanei
Prima eravamo perfetti insieme, ora siamo solo perfetti estranei
Di gente che mi chiede ""Come stai?"" sono pieno
Ma non ce la faccio a parlare con loro, 0
Più dicono ""Prova"" più ci provo solo meno
Mi hai inquinato tanto dentro che ora ho un cuore d'oro nero
Che non ho un futuro ma per come sono stato
Vorrei quasi non avere neanche il passato
La persona giusta al momento sbagliato
Così triste che ho un sorriso smagliato
La camicia buona la metto al manicomio
Morto dentro e dormo sul letto d'obitorio
Amaro in bocca, colluttorio
Buona notte, sogni d'odio

Premi invio, corri via
Ci rincontreremo dentro a un incubo
Mi urli addio, ma non vai via
E ti fai spazio nel mio letto singolo
Nei sogni sei quella che mi ama
Ma se mi sveglio, tu sei lontana
Tu sei lontana, tu sei lontana
Ci rincontreremo dentro a un incubo

Spingimi via, dimmi che mi odi
Insultami nei peggior modi
Questo mare di indifferenza in cui nuoti
Mi basta sapere che ancora qualcosa lo provi
Sputami addosso, altro veleno
Fammi sentire ancora importante
Forse per questo che ero al settimo cielo 
E da lì che se cadi fai il botto più grande
E per l'ultima volta, lasciami in lacrime
Come la volta in cui stavo tremando e ho sbattuto la porta talmente forte
Che ho fatto tremare anche tutto lo stabile
Ho trovato dei ricordi, sono i nostri
Dammi solo 2 secondi, come fossi
Seduto lì vicino a te, mi conosci
Quando vado al cinema prendo ancora 2 posti
E mi sento un giocoliere al semaforo
Tu mi guardi da dentro l'abitacolo
Appena scatta il verde come niente te ne vai
E mi lasci da solo che devo finire lo spettacolo

Premi invio, corri via
Ci rincontreremo dentro a un incubo
Mi urli addio, ma non vai via
E ti fai spazio nel mio letto singolo
Nei sogni sei quella che mi ama
Ma se mi sveglio, tu sei lontana
Tu sei lontana, tu sei lontana
Ci rincontreremo dentro a un incubo

Mi sto addormentando mentre guido e so che
Ci rincontreremo dentro a un incubo
Guardo il lato passeggero e non c'è traccia di te
Non esitare adesso che mi scrivi addio

Premi invio, corri via
Ci rincontreremo dentro a un incubo
Mi urli addio, ma non vai via
E ti fai spazio nel mio letto singolo
Nei sogni sei quella che mi ama
Ma se mi sveglio, tu sei lontana
Tu sei lontana, tu sei lontana

Shade,"Eri così bipolare che
Quando lo facevamo, era una cosa a tre
Anche se eravamo solo io e te
Ti ho salvato con due nomi sopra il mio cell
E mi chiedi come va? Bene, anzi male
Sono notti che mi sveglio 
E non smetto più di ansimare, ma sì, amen
Ti chiedo di non passare, passi uguale
Lasci così tanto amaro in bocca che lo potrei masticare
Mai sfidare uno pazzo più di te
Non ti fidare della brava gente
Il TG ti chiederà di me
Dire ""Che strano, salutava sempre""
Io ti adoro anche se sei un'ansia vivente
Pazza di me, pazza di mente
Me ne hai fatte mille, ma mi passa di menteù
Il mio analista che cosa direbbe?
Sono il tipo che lascia le porte aperte
Che ti sorride anche quando non si diverte
Probabilmente sei pazza da sempre
Mi avrai rovinato anche la vita precedente

Forse stavo meglio, quando c'eri tu
La verità fa male, le bugie di più
Sei stronza e bipolare quindi ti parlo al plurale
Dimmi che tanto mi odi 
In entrambi i modi e non c'è niente da fare
Perché con te non so mai con chi sto a parlare
Sei stronza e bipolare
Tu sei due persone diverse con la faccia uguale
Sei stronza e bipolare

Il tuo cuore è diviso in due
Un bilocale in cui c'è poco spazio e ci vivo male
Ti vedo lontana pure da vicino
Lente bifocale, sei la mia stella bipolare
E dici sì, poi scrivi no, io resto lì, in bilico
Do tutto ma per te è il minimo 
Coi tuoi messaggi mi assidero
Dici che non sono più quello di una volta
Non pendo più dalle tue labbra, ma da una corda
Sembra di essere in Alaska quando ci si incontra
Così fragile che a stringerti mi sento in colpa
E da quando hai deciso di andartene
Non vedo più il sole, Antartide
Puoi uscire di testa, parti per 
Venire nel mio mondo, Atlantide
Siamo seri
Sono come un regalo che non ti è piaciuto 
Ma per cui ringrazi e dici ""Non dovevi""
Svuota pure i bicchieri delle stronzate che bevi
L'amore è cieco ma ti uccide, Daredevil

Would you forgive me lord, (My niggaz want freedom) if I killed that man

Now they say daylight come but me won't go home (I wanna go..I wanna go..wanna go)
Daylight come but me can't go home (I gotta..gotta..gotta..gotta)
I've been living been in this cell for too long (I've been gone way too long)
Daylight come and I just wanna go home
They say daylight come but me won't go home (Daylight..daylight..daylight)
(I wanna go..I wanna go..wanna go)
Daylight come but me can't go home (I gotta..gotta..gotta..gotta)
I've been living been in this cell for too long (I've been gone way too long)
Daylight come and I just wanna go home

[Layzie Bone]
I wanna go home, better yet I think I want to escape
Get me away from all this wickedness that done piled up on my plate
Constate hate, is it my fate
Trying to build off within me, all of these jealousies and envies
Got me watching out for my enemies, weed and Hennessy
Got my mind blurry
And everybody is so when to hurry to tell they crime story
But all the time worry, who get the glory?
When everybody got to perish, is it that money that you cherish?
Or that baby in the carriage, scared to death
Not me never, one of my baby boys is gone
Probably kicking it up in heaven, thugging at the crossroads with Tombstone
You wrong, who wrong
For packing that pipe, Mr. Officer
Got you thinking out your coffin sir
And need me 'cause I'm soft and sir

They say, they say, they say, they say that daylight came so I'm suppose to crack a smile?
But tell me what am I here to live for?
And what am I gonna do now?
Got my whole life on trial
Gave my life is such a risk
Look I got my point, I'm taking my roll
But still I seem to miss
Give me about 30 minutes yo, I won't feel a thang
Except my problem changing range, and time appear empty and may (empty and may)
Why does it come to this?
I'm in the orange jumper, pleading a case in front of a judge who won't budge
I'm in the bus, he in the gate

[Krayzie Bone]
The cell doors locked
My heart dropped
Knew it was over
My life known on the outside, does not exist no longer
Caught up in this system, I'm fucked
Took my freedom away, I'm stuck
Man I pace myself night after night
Wondering what in the fuck have I done (Lord what have I done..done)
By the way my name is slim
And I'm here for murder in the first degree
On some niggaz who put up and tried to murder me
Self-defense, that ain't how the judge saw it
Said I was a menace because of my prior record and that he was sorry
That he had to do it, but hey
Shit, I believe if he was sorry, motherfucker wanting to send me away
That's why I say lets start the riot, nigga motherfuck peace (fuck peace)
Until we get freedom

Now let me hear you scream, fuck the police (fuck the police)
Pump your fist and scream, fuck the police (fuck the police)
Let me hear you scream, fuck the police (nigga fuck the police)
Pump your fist and scream, fuck the police (fuck the police)
Now let me hear you scream, fuck the police (fuck the police)
Pump your fist and scream, fuck the police (fuck the police)
Let me hear you scream, fuck the police (fuck the police)
Now pump your fist and scream, fuck the police (fuck the police)
Let me hear you scream (Let me hear you scream)

It's your life

(verse 2)
Now I got to hit you wit some other shit
Sentinella gutta shit
Four sides of the chrome
Flows smack you wit the rubber grip
Never been a nigga, niggas want to play they cards wit
See me in the dark whip
Better go call your guards quick
Better go hit the block and tell them bitches that shisty shit
Known the freaks face like that yellow bezel ice shit
Similar response
Yo that kid spit the nieces
Baby re-intise this
Cd's raise they prices
Make a nigga chain
Paid off in a different name
Maid think they got flame
Shade just hit the brain
Me and ja fucked around and made the teams a list
Two niggas from two sides
Like a 7/10 split bitch

(verse 3)
Niggas from the east
Christ from the gun to the mics
I'm living my life
Running through hell wit no ice
It's a sin
But I'd sell my lost soul to win
Go to bed and die
Then I'd wake up breathing again
Cause I'm all in
Even though shit ain't right
I wake up sweatin my life every night
Help me
Is it the devil that going to get me
Or is it god don't feel like being bothered wit me
So hard to hit me
This life a sacrifice
If I grow blind through the dark my kids gonna see the light
If I die young it's cause a nigga too high strung
Got scary love for gun wit too much weed in my lungs
And still niggas screaming ja the one

The god's only be gotten son

[Verse: Shade Sheist]
Yo, it ain't nothin' new (ain't nothin'), just a change in the name
Sheist done came and changed the game unexplained
Ways for days show you how to wait for your pay
Cause when Shade fuck up your sales, all your checks delay
And now niggas mad cause Shade can pull up in a Jag 
Hands free, chaperone all gettin' the door
And I ain't even interested in stealing your whore
So why these niggas actin like they want to marry the floor?
Like they ain't seen me breeze past all the gaurds at the door
Like I'm just wearin' this jacket to be hot
I flash the juice card, man this shit ain't hard
And It's the same thing at the same spot
What's my name?

[Chorus] (2x)
[Vocoder Box:]It's John Doe
[DJ Quik:] 4-5's spittin' up outta the
[Vocoder Box:]Four Door
[DJ Quik:] No return fire cause they 
[Vocoder Box:]Too slow {*gunshots*}
[DJ Quik:] What's the dilly?
[Vocoder Box:] Cause we kill for a living
[DJ Quik:] We kill for a livin'

[Verse: Shade Sheist] 
They want to know why I keep it so simple
I see that they just don't get it like my Nextel signal
Sheist on some other shit, Centinella gutter shit
Cards on the table, you can hit me or split 
And see now I fucked around and got Quik on the shit
So just imagine how many hips break when they dip
And all the excessive paper cuts from counting the grip
And how my legs hurt from humpin' back and forth in the whip
At only 35, coverage is a bitch on a six
And I ain't even got my first plaque yet (plaque yet)
Sheist, will still run circles over niggas who want it
And we ain't even gotta make the bets yet
Nigga what's my name?

[Chorus] (2x)

[Verse: Hi-C]
Throat-choke a hoe, Big Giggolo
Pimp the world, handcuff your hoe
Twurk your girl, when I step into the atmosphere
Niggas strapped wit fear, uh!
Is he is what I said he is and all
When I pimp bitches all dick and balls
Shade Sheist nothin' nice, new to the game
Get your money homie, bitch what's my name?

[Verse: AMG]
Hey-hey! we gon' hit these niggas where it hurt (uh)
Put the worm in your mouth like a perch (uh)
When I'm cum boo you gon' need a cert
Bust one, jump in the Monte Carlo and skirt (skirt!)
Give em naps, give 'em dap, then I holla holla back
""Hey nigga where you goin'?""
Boo I'm checkin' my traps
y'all niggas done shitted and stepped back in it
I'll fuck a nigga up all I need is five minutes.

[Verse: Swift]
Swift, and I pimp hoes like it's a gift
I got game so you know I'm ""The Answer"" like Allen I.
Got your whole style shook like 'Quilles or Kobe Bry'
While money multiply you haters ask why
No you can't stop the pimpin' the pimpin' is too fly
Runnin' game on yo wife while you out flossin' your ride
But she said, ""if you ain't busy, or close in the vicinity
Stop on by and come get the thighs.""

When I wake up in the morning, when I get up out of my bed
At all times I remain a hustler, at all times I be chasing my bread
Since this one's for my people, I'ma make sure you heard what I said
Daddy say speak loud and clearly, daddy say aim for the head
I think we all to cool to lose it, I say we all stay leveled instead
I say still we tame the hookers, I know we still eluding them feds
We make this one for the Negroes, and for the Caucasians who care
They say they treat us like we equal
I say they treat us like we just don't care

Yo, I wake up late but still got currency
Dreams, snooze button no I'm trying to sleep
I got bill and the ends ain't trying to meet
So I'm pressed for cash and I'm out of my league

So my hours are nine to five and my job's the street
I'm in a low position trying to hope these mission

And the block West stat and the spot we sure have
Rallies on Manchester, Inglewood on Saturdays turn to night
Shade always been the type to show love to those whom always doin' right

Yo, it don't matter where you from
Not knowing not where you been
Can't go to sleep a child expect to wake a man
Yo, life is a lesson niggas who don't study
End up failing test and blame it on me
But see Sheist only gets what he claiming to be
A real quiet motherfucker with his heart in the streets
Hot in these beats, flow sell a lot in a week
So even Billboard couldn't drop my highest of peaks
I'm with the breaks so you knowin' what they saying to me
I'm impressed how many people end up hating on me
Like a disease Shade hittin' wit' a new vaccine
I leave 'em comatose falling asleep

To try to stop me from livin', huh? Try again faggot
You've gotta ride better than that
To move out in front of the pack, it's two thousand and two

My backpack raps got my backpack
Strapped and filled with plaques
I ain't relaxed or laid back at home with my feet up
I drop Pravda, lock and load, heat the streets up
You weak fuck

Shakin' and dancin'
Y'all takin' pills, we takin' penitentiary chances
I'm too advanced is
Never the same when I hit it and quit it
You want it come get it, I'm wit' it

When I say that I'm wit' it
That means I got a main defense team that's gon' get me acquitted
G's is walkin' out the courtroom like George Jefferson
Stop the interviewin', the faggot had it comin' to him

Goin' hard on the yard till my dogs bail me

I woulda came but I was dead broke, no mo
I'm rollin' on some real, oh no

I'm the realest and they all know real dope
You need a filter or you will choke, indo
That's all a nigga will smoke, oh no

Now, niggas better get between their door, door
I'm shakin' all your shit onto the floor
And niggas don't get it
But be careful what you ask for you just might get it

Yo the undisputed middle weight champ runnin' like Hopkins
Clap six to ya shins niggas start hoppin', Shiest never stoppin'
In other words, if your click full
Can't press mute and it don't apply now

I'm feelin' funny in the tummy
And a nigga ain't been eatin' for weeks, I'm sick
I ain't trying to get no better but rather
Infect the world leavin' Vicks in a old sweater

Knoc's landin', tell me if it ain't me, who got the best planin'?
Who got your ears tuned it and who keeps you listenin'?
Who gots your undivided attention?
Who makes your panties wet, girl?

Hold up, pause, which nigga on TV
That you see makes you wanna give up the draws
At parties and shows, I mash regardless
Yo hardest flows couldn't stop this bombardment
I clench the vision till there's no room for expansion

All prepared for war it's Knoc's landin'
A nightly stalker, in shadows I walk
Mindin' my own while haters throw soft
The more I succeed, the more bitches clock

Through my peripheral vision, I watch subconsciously
Waitin' to introduce you to tragedy see it's Knoc's landin'

Everything will change

Shades Of Brooklyn,"At the end of 1974, when daddy dukes went raw
The chosen sperm to explore and reach the egg for sure
A child through the birth canal on the nine mo' trial
Released on this wild earth, my generation hit worst
Will my development arrested by the government
Younga niggas strugglin', livin' life got me wonderin'
New shit I'm discoverin', yo son I can't sleep
Situation so deep, my niggas drownin' in the streets
Another rapist'll stalk, a younger murder is walked
They got shit locked in a fort, a buck fif' if you're tossed
Verbalizin' hard times, findin' ways to recline
Dedicated to the rhyme brought your shades and your wine
I survived hard times prime time, as I rewind
My thoughts and remmeniss, sippin' O.E. quarts
Rest in peace to my peeps who died up in the streets
Fuck Halloween treats cause ain't shit sweet

Change, my life has changed 
Change, (change) and I will never be the same
Change, my life has changed
Change, (change) and I will never be the same

Growin' up on the Brooklyn streets
It was hard for Black T to make these motherfuckin ends meet
The first store that closed up got stuck
and if you didn't gimme your cash
I'd put one in somebody's gut
I ran buckwild through these streets with this group of individuals
committing crimes well performed like a ritual
Until one day my momz tried to send me up-state to job core
I didn't know what the fuck for
So I, pulled out my pals
And called up the nigga Al
What's the deal son it's been a fuckin' long while
He said yo Black T, I had this dream about this cream
I'm going all out for mines by any fuckin' means
We grabbed our pen and pads
And wrote about this world gone mad
And how times was getting real bad
But what we need to do
Is connect with them other two
And make that dream you had come true

I'm out the front door
Don't want to deal with this bullshit no more
What for? I'm ready to throw this heart on the floor
Back in the days, yo, Ty had it all
Women on call, sex and all
Summer, winter, spring, and the fall 
Then my momz broke out to get away from men why no doubt
Then I settled down and made one girl a spouce
Should of known, couldn't replace momz
My heart rang the alarm, situation was da bomb
I roamed the streets, started smokin weed
Drinkin Heinie's tappin' hinies
Writin' words to rich beats
Became an everyday stuggler
Stereotyped a hustler
Constant bother
Resided with my father frequently talked with my mother
Reactions crazy, revenge thoughts, maybe
Asking what am I doin here
Someone come save me 
'Cause I feel I got no purpose
Dabilatino surface
There's different type moves
With an attitude that's nervous
And nothing can help me maintain my mind frame
Now I'm doing shit I never did before

Change, (change) and I will never be the same
Change, the world has changed
Change, (change) and it will never be the same

Brought up on green and patch
You'll never have no ash
and everyday I find myself in the same old fashion
Saddened, my same fuckin' Pumas and Lees
Tore up at the knees
That would always squeeze
My buns, I have no funds
I'm young and dumb
Left school at three o' clock
To face an eviction
In tears as it appears my crib for years
Has just been rented to the landlord kids
No rhythm, cause my rep grows rather rash
Surpassed third class quick to stash, when the photo flash
In contrast, I was labeled as an outcast
Afraid to tell the cast
Cause chicks can tell me kiss they ass
Low self esteem but mom dukes kept me clean
Swayed from Spalding, Paydays and madman drinks
Shantlell my princess, she will live to be a queen
And as the moonbeam
Me and my team we'll be countin' cream

Shades of Culture,"[Verse 1]
Getting armored.  For armaggeon
When the east coast/west coast beef turns to hamburger
The microphone is my metal committing mental murder
My brain waves cascade through baracades
Searching for fascists to transform
Swing the vocal axes, if you didn't practice, it be embedded in your backs
Quick like faxes, from next to rasp(?) creeps
Turn around and face the music
Catch the mace to your face piece

CHORUS
Yet another hip-hop head took a turn for the worse
It must have hurt to have your realm burst
And certainly, crossing swords with me will spell your doom
Rev rev, the revolution is coming soon

[Verse 2]
If you see my shining smile you better duck or grab a mic
Because your universe will end in one single flash of light
When the Earth falls off its axis, you'll fly spinning into the cosmos
Do the same thing last night so you'll be searching for your lost prose
In outer space without a case, you can not judge me
Not that I would but if I do fall off, I'll spring back like bungee
Elasticized, never plastified like RuPaul
I'm the unseen terror, by night fall you might fall
Off your pedestal but leave my rhyme work alone
You can't decode my shit without the use of Rosetta stone
This ain't Costco or price chopper hip-hopper
Take one, the beat dropper, crush your head with the neck bopper

CHORUS

[Verse 3]
My roots extend deep into the planet
Through bedrock and magma, disintegrating granite
Back when Osiris and Isis circumnavigated the globe eliminating crisis
Struck down by treason, but what's the reason
For brothers against brothers, it's wrong in any season
Face facts, stay strong and be bold
Take a look at your past, let your soul unfold

Funny, but here's that rainy day
Here's that rainy day they told me about
And I laughed at the thought that it might turn out this way

After it brought my lover near

Shades of Kenton Jazz Orchestra,"Somewhere over the rainbow, way up high
There's a land that I've heard of once in a lullaby.
Somewhere over the rainbow, skies are blue
And the dreams that you dare to dream,
Really do come true.

Someday I'll wish upon a star
And wake up where the clouds are far behind me.
Where troubles melt like lemon drops,
High above the chimney tops,
That's where you'll find me.

Somewhere over the rainbow, blue birds fly
Birds fly over the rainbow
Why then, oh why can't I?
If happy little bluebirds fly beyond the rainbow
Why, oh why can't I?

Somewhere over the rainbow, way up high
There's a land that I've heard of once in a lullaby.
Somewhere over the rainbow, skies are blue
And the dreams that you dare to dream,

And wake up where the clouds are far behind me.
Where troubles melt like lemon drops,

Shades of Kenton Jazz Orchestra,"Let's build a stairway to the stars
And climb that stairway to the stars
With love beside us to fill the night with a song
We'll hear the sound of violins
Out yonder where the blue begins
The moon will guide us as we go drifting along
Can't we sail away on a lazy daisy petal
Over the rim of the hill?
Can't we sail away on a little dream 
And settle high on the crest of a thrill!
Let's build a stairway to the stars
A lovely stairway to the stars",Stairway to the Stars,1995

Take a sad song and make it better
Remember to let her into your heart

You were made to go out and get her
The minute you let her under your skin
Then you begin to make it better

And anytime you feel the pain, hey Jude, refrain
Don't carry the world upon your shoulders
For well you know that it's a fool who plays it cool
By making his world a little colder

Hey Jude, don't let me down
You have found her, now go and get her
Remember to let her into your heart
Then you can start to make it better

So let it out and let it in, hey Jude, begin
You're waiting for someone to perform with
And don't you know that it's just you, hey Jude, you'll do
The movement you need is on your shoulder

Shades of Brooklyn motherfuckers
Beatminerz, check this shit out here
Check it

[Wild Son]
Columbus thought the earth was flat
I copped the map, to navigate on track
Repercussions don't buy Black, false allegations
I rush through nations like some Haitians
Since my incubation I been destined for this paper
Timbs scraper, fly shape up, got my weight up
Laugh at haters, smack 'em now, kill 'em later
Small Soldiers, action figures in motion pictures
You read off scripts, and for the feds gave tips
Icebergs sank ships, Shades load up clips
Cock back the four-fifths then continue to spit {*two gunshots*}
Blow ya neck off, ya specs lost, respect black to the boss
Get those hands chopped off, for thinking I'm soft
I'm quite well of course, many feet with this rhyme technique
Beat off the heat with an ear to the streets nigga
Word life motherfucker
Wilson Ave, hand cock, Wild Son motherfuckers

[Wilson Ave]
Now you know what type of shit I'm on
I feed on the broke, the poor, and the weak-n-sore
I defeated all these tribes and the gangs
I'm that number one killer, Drama!

[Wild Son]
why yall niggas can't fuck with this
Black mongol slave, Pastor Gray,
low see's and no feds, it's time to get paid
Hold the hand grenade with the pin in my mouth, issued army
So when you come to get me kill off everybody
Escaped from a trapped room, my hood is Beirut
The buds recruit, while all the guards, crackers was true
Good health and wealth, for cheddar cheese as green as dough melt
Some cried some died from the pain that's felt
Why fight? Why fuss? That's what the want from us
But if it's love that's lost, then there's no more trust
With that fake love, that cause to get your brain straight plugged
Gun held snubbed, seen your fams and gave 'em a hug
Did I see you? Nah, I wouldn't want to be 'em
Sort as wounds treat 'em, deep in foundation
Best believe that's how I leave 'em
 
[Wilson Ave]
Ain't no cure for this, what I suffer from is mentally
I got drama with one, drama with these hoes
Shit I even got drama with this finger
And I'ma damn sure die with it, forever having drama
Since birth I've seen it everywhere
New York, Houston, St. Louis, even Kansas City
What cha'll know about that

[Wild Son]
Competition, there is none, fuck with Black and get done
Pack guns, gat-lers, rocking all the latest fashions
You gotta love me, for being young, black, and hungry
Considered ugly, but since this money wanted to plug me
I keep it humble, speak to myself so call me Mumbles
Move some Buddu's, until the these rush through
Or maybe touch you, cats wanted two from the crew
This shit is tense, you out the fence, you even lost one shoe
Ran a marathon even though the cops ass won
Shit was on, rapper we get it be gone
Meet you at the stash crib, twelve blocks from where you live
Don't say shit, even turn your wife and your kids
Daddy's on the run now, all alone with low reprise
No cries now, the way a real nigga gets down
Facing death, stealing somebody's life's called theft
Black know's best, this even go's for the opposite sex
No regrets, I did what I did, ah from the whip
Kids think sick, pack big shit, extended clips
Motherfuckers, yea yea
Get it all, bring it on what

[Wilson Ave]
There's three types of drama
One that gives drama, one that receives drama
And one that watches drama
Sometimes the outcome you wouldn't believe
Don't sit there and front like you never felt it
Maybe just that the wrong nigga sent it
So when you find yourself afraid, frightened
Fearing for your life, pray I'm not after you
Drama!

Fuck a presidential limousine

Or Impalas on chrome d's 
Follow me and see why everybody calls me hostile
How motherfuckers be hatin' 'cause I live a gangsta lifestyle
My profile is so wild you wouldn't want to kick it

With these two young thugs, packin' snubs and gettin' convicted
Inflictin' much pain like my a.k.a. was migraine
Make a fool swallow piss for disrespectin' my name
From the sky falls rain to the streets, you'll fall victim

And all I got to say to my thugs is fuck the system

And if you say you'se my homie, don't decieve me
Cause when I say I'm gonna kill, you best believe me

Even out of town we break motherfuckers down like car trouble
Tricky grab an axe and a shovel
Show these sons of hood rats who gots the bag of tricks
Full of guns, ammunition, screwdrivers and ice picks

We pick who dies, when the wolf cries
Brutalize mothafuckas, catch em by surprise
We're unexpekted like a car crash
Head bash a mothafucka, and give him whip lash
Think fast, blink and it's your ass up in pieces
Have your mom screamin for Jesus

Down to buck motherfuckers
Better duck or that ass get plucked motherfucker

I'm seein' my enemies bleedin' sleepin' in their blood
I'm fantasizin' homicidal thoughts like Charles Manson
Money schemin' plots to come up, like hold you for ransom

It's all about the skrilla homie, I'll put a price on your head
And iIf they don't pay up by mornin best believe that you're dead
Playin wit your life like God but I don't care

Killa California's Most Wanted
Most wanted
You know, you know, you know

From Dago to LA
Check it

Feel the bass like the back of my hand when it hits
All you fake motherfucker on my wannabe list
Ain't that a bitch, back again with a gangsta twist
It's Mr. Shadow from Dago, Southern Cali the sick
Homey with metal or sticks we can get our bang on
Real G's kicking them punk bitches never stay long
Lil' who? never heard of you homey
Keep my name out your mouth or I'll murder you homey
You all know me as the night stalker
619 Amici Parker dodging cops and helicopters
To hell with you coppers
Fuck your neighborhood watching crime stoppers you nosey motherfuckers
Mind your own business if you want to live longer
Roam with the sickest if you want to be stronger
Ain't nothing wrong but your lips running wild
So shut the fuck up or get a dick up in your mouth

When we come up in your hood we make em bow down
From SD to Hollywood we make em bow down
When you're rolling in your ride you better bow down
And when they speak on Brown Pride we make em bow down

You want to battle me and Shadow
You up the creek without a paddle motherfucker, round em up like they were cattle
I'm hitting harder than your fucking stepfather
And I'm coming through your hood heated like I was lava
You caught up in some bullshit
I got a full clip of shells for motherfuckers, you knew you couldn't fool this
So deal with it homey the best that you can
Or I'll come up in your hood and it's just me and my man
We'll be strapped down with guns, got gats in each hand
And I'll do you like Godzilla did to fucking Japan
So embrace a motherfucker like I was a god
And you can meet me in the back and we'll be taking a shot
Breaking em off a little something, man you know how we do it
I'll be puffing on a pound in the back, sipping the fluid
I'm keeping it Brown, I'm sipping the Crown
I'm puffing a pound, I'm making them all bow down

When we come up in your hood we make em bow down
From SD to Hollywood we make em bow down
When you're rolling in your ride you better bow down
And when they speak on Brown Pride we make em bow down

When we come up in your hood we make em bow down
From SD to Hollywood we make em bow down
When you're rolling in your ride you better bow down
And when they speak on Brown Pride we make em bow down

Bow down it's the sickest
Motherfucker with the thickest caliber grain known to bust the quickest
It's Killer Cali baby haven't you heard
We're some everyday bangers blazing trees on the curb
Nothing but sticky herb swerving down the highway
When I'm in this bitch, shit we do it my way
Fly straight or get your wings cut off
A tatted up G, all you bitches fuck off
A snub nose for all you punk hoes
23 to the motherfucking 20
You know we don't play in the streets
It's Mr. Shadow and the Saint ALT
The most requested, caution is suggested
Figures you can get some hoe, don't try to test this
Smith and Wessun repping, loaded for you haters
I'll smoke now and I'll worry about you bitches later

Made some mistakes I'm not too proud
But I've turned it all around
Living for right here right now
I'm getting higher every day
I'm growing stronger in a way
I'm living life with no glance
But I'm not finished yet
I'm not finished yet
So I'm just gonna keep on climbing
Until I find my silver lining

And higher and higher and higher

Long before the fall of rain shall come 
Listen to me 
For the last time that I was tempted to the dance of fools 
Closer to me 
I crawled away a loser 

I never knew it meant so much to hold a place of power 
Where only dreaming sets you free 
I never thought that you could hold me so completely 
You tore off my mask and I could see

Double crossed by their own lives 
Bring them to me 
I want to take them to a new tomorrow of yesteryear 
Call them to me 
Let us live forever on 

Tonight I shall cast a stone into the sea of sorrow 
Its waves they crash beneath my feet 
Sorrow binds you to a life not worth living 
Unto that mortal life you cling 

Stripped of all your earthly pride with the fools you dance

Come unto me 
Send with great speed this message all across the land

Too bad it's only for a moment
Lost in the shadows of the night

Stay by my side, slip between the light
Mirror my image we'll be alright

The key that opens up a thousand doors of mystery
Unlocks a basement full of fears
Start to unravel in it you might as well be blind

My cloak and dagger 

I'm not so sure that I enjoy this journey 
They've got their guns to my head 
I turn myself into the black of darkness 
They chase their shadows instead

Took me to the place where the preacher lived 
He gave me serum 
And he blessed my mission helped me get my grip

Codes and weapons and my boarder pass

Sheets of ice shards of broken glass 

All alone I cannot rest

The gifts of our lives

I command light and solar winds 
To transport me 
The deepest assurance 
I speak with my mind 

Caves of glass 
Shatter before me 
The wheels are in motion 
Forever they turn 

And are carved in the great book of life 
There in your room 
Alone in the shadows 
I smashed down the walls 

And set you free 
I carry the torch 
That trembles the mountains 
Seen visions of power

You close your eyes 
I reach out and touch you 
Reflections in pools

The mist of dawn still rising
Brushing from my face
Cold tears of finally knowing
The world that we had twisted
The years of strength and glory
Were wicked and obscene
And there we stood so proud
What legends we must be
Really something to behold Lord
So irresponsible
With the powers of creation

Robed in the finest cloth
Dauntlessly invincible
So perfect so unreal

Gone are her streets her giant towers

I know there's just one way
And this is how it has to be

And there was hatred in our eyes

Something made it right
We purged our hearts and souls
And we saw through children's eyes
Not stifled by the pain
Not blinded by our

The lies behind our ways
The reasons for the end

Babylonia disappeared
I now return here a survivor
The rest have vanished to thin air

I am sure enough alone
And I am sure enough alive

What the rest could never see

Longing for a morning star
Held on high

The last footsteps ever wonder here
They echo in my mind
Never to return

I sat alone and I spoke out loud
On this darkened afternoon
The windows to my room
A solemn shutter on the world
Where I used to laugh and dream
For the first time in so long I make
My way down to the street and watch
The people as they pass

Outside I breathe the air
And all around fall shadows of despair

I wonder is there hope for us
A place where we can all be free
I wonder is there life inside a soul that dies?
I wonder is there hope for us
To lift me up I don't know when
I'll see the sun again
I'd like to feel alive
Just one more time

Headlines on the floor
Today's bitterness is the calling card
The commercial masquerade
The goods all on parade
The needs of life are charming toys
We've gone deaf from all the noise
WHen did the rich and powerful elite
Slowly and unnoticed
Come and steal our innocense?

Entranced - we danced their dance
The stage is set the crowd is on their knees

I wonder is there hope for us
A place where we can all be free
I wonder is there life inside a soul that dies
I wonder is there hope for us
We're stranded with no place to go
I'm feeling so alone
I'll try to make my way

Do they all come alive and breathe?
It's no wonder
This is a brand new world we're on
I'd really like to meet you somewhere along

Where you are I can only guess
Addictive screens
I just cannot turn away

Where are you anyway?
Those things you say seem so damn far from real
But I can tell you this
I have seen things for myself that just don't seem right
I have always been an honest man
I believed that the system
Worked for
You and for
Me but - no
You say it's just a show
And we've all been way too busy
Or too spoiled to even care who's got the wheel

I used to look behind the lies
Use to look for sunny skies
I learned so much since I've been
Hacking their computer systems
The truth had knocked me to the floor
That a boy now out the door
A little power and I'm
On my way to logging on the world

The way you come to me is such a mystery
I just reach out and connect
A thousand miles from me and yet it's all right here

A stranger to this world so lost
And as the winter draws I'm turning north

I'm leaving things behind I just don't need

And turned and walked away

I've traveled too long on my own
I've got a dream of home
Safe at last...

Where are all the answers
And visionary wisdom
From the stately and esteemed?
Just as I thought...
Disconsolate I ponder
The evil human nature
And what it really means
For the ones who paved the way

No bag of gold can save their souls
It's like they never feared
But now their end is near

Through the dark vast weight only silence lingers on
The origin of existence lies somewhere far far beyond
I feel unattached tranquility
A hand from the heavens guiding me
And wondering where this path will lead
In a dream I'm lost and
Floating through the atmosphere
Searching for significance against
Infinity eternity
I've been taken by the vast and
Humbled by the weight of what I've seen
You know they called for heroes
'Cause heroes carry on
In know the world is fading
So from the first gray light of the morning I've been gone
Now I pray for a better life
For all the ones I love
We search beyond our reach
And turn our gaze above
I hope that it's the way
To fill our basic needs
And my sacrifice not vain
And I'll return again

As I pass beyond the god of war
Distant voices hear them crying out
I must seek out new worlds and explore
And I know that there just must be a place
We will carry on
Where our children can be free from the pain

Can't save all the people I know

I fall into the black abyss of night
I'm gone
The pioneering spirit charges the unknown
Accept the consequence of risk
I'm all alone here
Don't know if I'll return and
The fate of life is on my heart
I left a dying world behind
On my way oh
Where s our oasis in the sky
The future of our race
I left a poisoned world behind
Now I see there's no
Heaven bound oasis in the sky
Only dreams
I've got no destination
Helpless I drift on
The weight of silence how it's eating at my soul
And yet I sense a stirring
Something so spiritual
I wonder if the fate of mankind
Is in the hands of a higher power calling to us all

Wind and snow and ice are all I see
Save for you, my queen

Pounding rhythms, distant footsteps
Echo fear and drive my pain
I am crying out for love and for life eternal
I am witness
I've been purchased with blood
So many souls will burn out
The call requires an answer

I've chased material gain: it's the emptiest dream
I've watched it turn back to dust and it don't mean a thing
The spirit found its way in and it changed my whole life
I'm offering you my hope with the gift of this light
Please take this vow

Let's pack away
All our memories of home
Never look back
Certainly never return
Begin anew
You and I and snow and wind and ice
Will you surrender all your all to me? 

And in the comfort of my arms both noble and strong
I'll guide you safely through the storms, I will make you my song
Remaining steady and true for the rest of your life
I offer you up my hand, wanna make you my wife
Please take this vow
A passion purer than gold or the night's brightest star
My love for you only grows, it knows no earthly bounds
The time is right for us now, just believe what I say
I take your hand in my hand and I promise you the world
Promise you the world
Promise you the world
I make this vow
Please take this vow",Vow,2005

But he would man

She understood so she let

Shadow Project,"There floats a phantom
On this slum's foul air
A shape to eyes with the gift of seeing
Into the spectre of endless plight
Face to reshape, vanity fleeting

Red handed, red handed
Night dismembers
Red handed, red handed
Fight to remember
Another's life is racked with shame
Another lie still sounds the same
Feeding fuels of unkept fires
Wallow in your private mire

Into the spectre
Of endless plight
You'd like a face to reshape
But there's no sense
In fleeing
You're caught red handed
Red handed
Red handed, Red handed ...

On this slum's foul air
A shape to eyes with the gift of seeing

Face to reshape, vanity fleeing
Another's eyes open in vain
Another cry muffled with pain
Feeding fuels of unkept fires
Fall lifeless in your self made mire

About the the things you said concerning my singing

Oh, you said the top ten billboards, I could break in
Tell me are you for real or just faking?
I grow up and you think the hippies would dig me
I would work on my flow if you thought I had hip-hop in me

To impress the girls I'd work on my sensitivity
As for my debts, who's proud for punk crowd longevity

CHORUS
And if you told me that I could be famous
I present you with a list of changes I could make
We could fake the world out

It's all 'cause of us I'd caused shotgun on the tour bus
Playing every show shirt lest ladies would adore us
Throwing pennies on stage at every single chorus
Then we'd break up the band 'cause all this money bores us

Behind yourselves the sands ran through
They are the last ones to do action that brings comfort around you
Nothing will be theirs to defend by they don't even bother to make it start

Lies all around you is what you prove
Wasting away to nothing inside of you 
All that which then rang true
Lies and deception now show through

Faith and belief in what was real can't be found in an empty shell
Now as I watch your back
I see your unity is a joke
I'll take what is real over empty promises and lies

I've not given away, to the hate at all 
In the hands of someone who appreciates, from this vile heart
I pay such a pricedeath's face

In the hands of someone who appreciates, from this vile heart
I pay such a price

Left within your brain, cannot sustain.
Coming from your action creates a reaction
Left within your brain, cannot sustain

Kill me long before I wake
Take me to my sleep I wait
Stifle my breath with every scream
I don't know when I lost my dreams

All my hopes, all my desires now extinguished in my wills fire.

Come with me and some hate I'll share

Darkness is all that I see
I cannot reach you

They start the fires burning until they surround

Is there nothing left, nothing left worth fighting for, fighting for?

The panic builds up from deep within
The subconscious mind
Always thought that the pain would end
With the passage of time

No matter how many layers deep
You try to hide yourself
They will all crack and peal away
To reveal something else

From the past we must break free
Come to terms with all that tortures me

Tragic memories invade
Let the storm winds wash them all away

I will be the only one who is left to decide
There will be no more room that is left for compromise
Break away from the curse of man's original sin
Turn away as you stay hidden behind a twisted grin

From the past we must break free
Come to terms with all that tortures me

Tragic memories invade
Let the storm winds wash them all away
Purified, I stand before the flames
As the ashes cover yesterday

Imprisoned by actions of the past
No use holding on

Let the storm winds wash them all away

Nigga, things change

Now watch me come up
I hustle, i hustle even harder
I put that work in to win, no problem

When nobody knows all the walls you go through
You can't even talk to those that supposedly know you
Some of the levels that these people'll go to, for crumbs
Damn tell me, is this what that dough do?
That's when you find yourself talkin to Pro Two
There's not to many people who ever can walk in Loc shoes
Its good as hell that my heart contains
I explain, so many different parts of pain
Im clean, but still some marks remain
From the past, when that crushed weed sparks to brang
The cash made some people start to change
I feel hate when i pulled up and parked the range
Ya damn right i got rich, but my heart the same
And practice makes perfect with the harder aim
You ain't really got the heart to bang
You ain't start to hang, till you find out I cought the chain..

And ""Humpin' Around"" like Bobby Brown across town
I ain't with that, so don't cramp my style
Step off me, I'm hyped like I had a pound of coffee
Yo how could you ask what I'm doin'
When I'm pursuin', gettin' funky with my crew and
My input brings vibes unknown like E.T.
Makes me phone home to my family
Cling, hello mom, I'm doin' it, freakin' more fame
Than Batman played by Michael Keaton
I crossed over, let me name someone that's black
With fame, and pockets that are fat
Hey, Erick Sermon, he's one
Packs a gun, that's bigger than Malcolm's
Out the window, I look for a punk to get stupid
So I can shoot his ass like Cupid
E 2 bingos, down with the Shadz of Lingo
Here to bust out the funky single

Yo I pack much dick, with the cover made of steel hoe
Yes yes, never fessed or settled for less
One clown stepped, and got a hole in the fuckin' chest
From the A.K., somebody scream mayday!
Took the sucker out, cause he clowned me on a payday
The funk is flowin' to the maximum
From the E Double, while I kick the facts to them
Check a chill brother with class, rough enough
To run up and snatch the spine out a niggas ass
Grip the steel when caps peeled, here to chill on the real
And don't give a motherfuck how you feel
Thinkin' you're steppin' to this, I kinda doubt it
Ain't with the bullshit, so you can write a fuckin' book about it
The big nigga with the bud and I'm on that
E kick the beat and yo you shoulda known that

Droppin that mellow but mad mackadocious
Melodious metaphorical music with mo' shit
That you used to, and stylin that you ain't
What else I got to do but draw the pictures with paints?
Oh no, there's my mic squeakin'
A soundman's body turnin' up every weekend
Some think I done the killin', you know I can't remember
I can't recall a full week since this past December
And mics catchin' fire 'fore I get the chance to touch em

Biting his lip
Nine on his hip
Having his pit, black thugs drinking them licks
Cutting up with his whole crew
And when we homemade, roll through
And break out when they suppose to
Cali Terror Mills to Harlem Brown
With enough ughh to go around
Make you lay the cat down
He get it thrown at him all day
And like my girl Shae

We gonna lay till four at the moment
Nothing but gray smoke from the jojo

Man have him woman and the woman so nice
Wash and she cook and everything she do right
Ring pon her finger, it make her him wife
Him don't coming late, him coming early at night

Him sight another sexy girl and she passing by
Read her, stand up and know him want her tonight
Inna fi him bed a where she put up a fight
Moaning and groaning, what a restless night
Someway, somehow it got to him wife
Wife fi get vexed and put him clothes in a pile

Love me girl, you know you want me
Kiss and caress me, love me up girl

Love me girl, you know you want me
Kiss and caress me, love me up girl

On the next train
Don't ask when I'm coming back, cha
Ring pon the finger, you're free fi yet part bond
No bother even think 'bout have no more fun

Well, ten o'clock occur, view that's when you're free fi yet part bond
You step trough the door, your wife mouth start run
Laba, laba, laba, laba with Dieter Burton
Now you tell her fi shut up, quiet her mouth and sit down
She still round a bag a beat our fire gone

But still you love me girl, you know you want me
Kiss and caress me, love me up girl

Love me girl, you know you want me
Hug and caress me, love me up girl

Shaggy,"Lately, I have had the strangest feeling
With no vivid reason here to find
Yet the thought of losing you's been hanging 'round my mind 
Far more frequently you're wearing perfume
With you say no special place to go
But when I ask will you be coming back soon
You don't know, never know 
Well, I'm a man of many wishes
Hope my premonition misses
But what I really feel my eyes won't let me hide
'Cause they always start to cry
'Cause this time could mean goodbye 
Lately I've been staring in the mirror
Very slowly picking me apart
Trying to tell myself I have no reason with your heart 
Just the other night while you were sleeping
I vaguely heard you whisper someone's name
But when I ask you of the thoughts your keeping
You just say nothing's changed 
Well, I'm a man of many wishes
I hope my premonition misses
But what I really feel my eyes won't let me hide
'Cause they always start to cry
'Cause this time could mean goodbye, goodbye 
Oh, I'm a man of many wishes
I hope my premonition misses
But what I really feel my eyes won't let me hide
'Cause they always start to cry
'Cause this time could mean goodbye",Lately,1994

Giving me migraine so much emotional pain

Shaggy ha

Sun and fun in the
Atmosphere, oh yes
In the summertime when
The weather is high
You can stretch right up
And touch the sky
When the weather is fine
You've got women
You've got women
On your mind
I'm gonna drive and ride and
See now what I can find

Now if her daddy's rich
Take her out for a meal
And if her daddy's poor
Then do as you feel
Speedin' down the lane even
Thought the speed limit's 25
And when the sun goes down
I'll make it with my cutie pie

Sexy as can be
Sweet as a honey

And the clothes she wear

And a draw down a gear
Some a shine up wax up

We say what we need
And we love everybody
And we do as we please

Go fishin' in the sea
We are happy to live life

Sweat a run off her body
With her caramel skin
I man smiled at her she
Looked at me and grinned

I offered her a drink she said
Juice and Gin
And I whispered in her ear
I asked how you doin'

Where was it that I reside
And I told her Brooklyn
Atmosphere filled with romance
Her eyes sparkling

Just her voice and what
She said let my poor head spin
Raggamuffin Shaggy
With a musical swing

I say
Pretty little woman
Sexy as can be
Sweet as a honey

Sting like bumble bee
In the summertime
When the weather is high
You can stretch right up

And touch the sky
When the weather is fine
You've got women
You've got women

On your mind
I'm gonna drive and ride
And see what I can find

Now if her daddy's rich
Take her out for a meal
And if her daddy's poor
Then do as you feel

Speedin' down the lane even
Thought the speed limit's 25
And when the sun goes down
I'll make it with my cutie pie

Pretty little women
Sexy as can be
Sweet as a honey
Sting like bumble bee
Pretty little women
Sexy as can be
Sweet as honey
Sting like bumble bee

Brasil, Jamaica
Sou brasileiro, sou muito feliz
Ouvi seu nome muito além de Paris
Saímos pra tocar, fomos pro lado de lã
América, Europa, de que tanto ouvi falar.
Ouvi muitas histõrias, ""Mundo novo é aqui""
Terra das maravilhas, Disneylandia e Mickey Mouse
Tocar com Ziggy Marley em Miami foi legal
Todas as potências do reggae mundial, então

E Jimmy Cliff na baixada uma hora nos falou
Que na Jamaica em Montego Bay
Numa favela ele viu nascer um rei
Sua mensagem que muito nos marcou
""Pois o reggae quando bate você
Nunca sente dor""
Assim dizia o rei que o mundo encantou
Assim dizia o rei que ao mundo provou
Que a liberdade e a sapiência
A sapiência
São peças chaves pra maior inteligência

Shaggy,"I remember, wasn't so long ago
We had a one room shack and the livin' was low
And my mama by herself raised me and my bro
Wasn't easy, but we did it with the little that go
Worked hard while got us off of school everyday
And kept her eyes on the stars when the skies were gray
Gave us pride to survive, really showed us the way
Now I really understood what she was tryin' to say

She said, ""Son there'll be times when the tides are high
And the boat may be rocky, you can cry
Just never give up
You can never give up,"" uh-uh

In this life you could lead if you only believe
And in order to achieve what you need
You can never give up
You can never give up

And this hope
That keep me holding on
On and on
And this hope
That makes me carry on
On and on

Boom-boom, couldn't have made it alone
I got a wonderful life, two kids on my own
With a strong foundation that was carved in stone
And my mama for the love that made my house a home
Made me wonder some time if this was meant to be
All this for a humble little guy like me
And all I ever really wanted was a family
To teach my kids the same value that she gave to me

She said, ""Son there'll be times when the tides are high
And the boat may be rocky, you can cry
Just never give up
You can never give up,"" uh-uh

In this life you could lead if you only believe
And in order to achieve what you need
You can never give up
You can never give up

And this hope
That keep me holding on
And on
And this hope
That makes me carry on
On and on

Me not gonna suffer, things are for better
Never let yourself be overcome by the pressure
?
See the man and watch ?
Blaze like fire, we nah go retire
Got nuff sleep and I am a expire
We haf a retire, that we require
We have to make a mark before the time expire

That keep me holding on
And on
And this hope
That makes me carry on

That keep me holding on
And on
And this hope
That makes me carry on

Ain't no need to rush it baby we can take it slow
I swear it must be cupid shooting arrows with his bow

Have me wondering now
Is it really me or tell me do you feel the same
I feel like I'm in love and I don't even know your name
I know what I am saying to you may sound pretty lame
Your love is like an everlasting flame

We could make a life together on the ocean shore
Paradise is where you are I'm ready to explore
Can never get enough of you it's all about amour
And happiness is knocking at your door

High heels gosh you look sexy 
I'd steal a touch if you let me 
I'm just dyin' to kick it with you girl 
Hey boo show me you're ready 
Lips looking juicy like cherry 
I can almost taste your flavor girl 

[hook]
But it seems like you're the wrong type 
Don't you ever get upset girl I'd like to see you sweat 
It just feels like you're too uptight 
Girl you're too conservative and that ain't how I want to live 

[chorus]
I want to a freaky girl somebody just like me 
Someone who understands just what a player needs 
Ain't with those perfect girls that shit don't click with me 
A very naughty girl that's what I need 

[verse]
Handcuffs can you get freaky 
How far will you go to please me 
Whips and chains girl are you down with that 
Strange places searching for pleasure 
I want you to meet me wherever 
Wearing just an overcoat and hat 

[hook]
Or was I right you're the wrong type 
You don't ever get upset I ain't never seen you sweat 
It just feels like you're too uptight 
Girl you're too conservative and that ain't how I want to live

Just twenty five, I'm not ready yet
Hey love let's make a deal
Give me some time I got a few hearts to steal
Hey love got more grounds to gain
Can't get stuck with a ball and a chain
Hey love I need to be sure
Come back and see me in two years or more

I remember as a kid I used to dream
I had a big crush on Sandra's kid sister Jean
But she was in love with Dwayne
Been so many years but I still feel the pain
What about the girl across the street
Took the same bus I use to reserve her seat
But she would just sit with her friends 
And the all talk about guys in Bimmers and Benz
Seem like my luck took a slide
Then shorty came along and stood by my side
I couldn't give her much but she stayed
Now I'm hitting all the charts it's so easy getting laid
Living in style I'm getting paid
Hooking up my peeps with the millions I've made
Now I'm having girl who I knew in first grade
Now I'm kinda feeling like my shorty getting played 
( so I'm begging you )

Hey love I need to be sure
Come back and see me in two years or more

I wasn't popular in school I wasn't popular in sports
All the girls I love loved the guys on the court
I feel like I been cheated of my youth 
'Cause back in the days braces weren't so cute
Girls used to laugh at my suit
Now I got models in bed knocking boots

The girl next door, ya know?
Man, I don't know what to do
(Say it wasn't you)
Alright

Honey came in and she caught me red-handed
Creeping with the girl next door
Picture this we were both butt naked
Banging on the bathroom floor
How could I forget that I had
Given her an extra key
All this time she was standing there
She never took her eyes off me

How you can grant your woman access to your villa
Trespasser and a witness while you cling to your pillow
You better watch your back before she turn into a killer
Let's review the situation that you're caught up inna
To be a true player you have to know how to play
If she say a night, convince her say a day
Never admit to a word when she say
And if she claims ah you tell her baby no way

But she caught me on the counter (It wasn't me)
Saw me bangin' on the sofa (It wasn't me)
I even had her in the shower (It wasn't me)
She even caught me on camera (It wasn't me)

She saw the marks on my shoulder (It wasn't me)
Heard the words that I told her (It wasn't me)
Heard the screams get louder (It wasn't me)
She stayed until it was over

Honey came in and she caught me red-handed
Creeping with the girl next door
Picture this, we were both butt naked
Banging on the bathroom floor
I had tried to keep her
From what she was about to see
Why should she believe me
When I told her it wasn't me

Makes you know say that she really no right for vex
A never you she see yah make the gigolo flex
A smaddy else a favor you inna di complex
Seein' is believin', so you better change your specs
You know she a go bring a whole heap a things up from the past
All the little evident, you betta know fe mask
Quick 'pon yuh hansa, know how fe talk
But if she pack a gun, you know, you betta run fast

Gonna tell her that I'm sorry
For the pain that I've caused
I've been listening to your reasoning
It makes no sense at all
We should tell her that I'm sorry
For the pain that I've caused
You may think that you're a player
But you're completely lost
That's why I sing

Reality check
You know what I mean
Street life's eh
Scorpion yeah uh

When I was young
I use to dream of being rich
Have a lot of houses and cars 
Couldn't know which one was which
And finding me a chick and getting hitched
Living the fairy tale life perfect without a ditch
You think that this would bring me happiness
If at the end of every rainbow 
There was a treasure chest
Sometimes having more is really less
So take a look inside yourself
You'll realize you're really blessed
No matter how you're sad and blue
There's always someone who has it worse than you
Sometimes you gotta pay your dues
So don't worry just push on through

Keep'n it real
Gotta big up all my peoples who be working on the future
Though they know they gotta struggle
Keep'n it real
To all my homies working on the 9 to 5
And doing right to keep themselves up out of trouble
Keep'n it real
Although sometimes I know it seems impossible
There ain't no need in drowning in your sorrows
Keep'n it real

You can be sure there'll be a brighter tomorrow

And I forgot to have myself the house, the mansion, and the Benz
I'm not the type of brother who be making mad ends
I got myself a girl but we be kickin' it as friends
Is not enough for me now that depends
Again- not everthing you want is everything you really need
The standard of society is modevated by greed
Are you prepared to follow
Tell me are you prepared to lead
So persevere and you'll succeed

Full up your cup till your juice's spill

Covered in sweat but feeling the chill

Help me Jesus I know what I am
Now that I know that I've need you so
Help me Jesus, my soul's in your hand.

Tell me Lord, if you think there's a way
I can try to repay
All I've taken from you
Maybe Lord, I can show someone else
What I've been through myself
On my way back to you.

Early Sunday morning in the spring of ninety-six
I'm chilling on my couch watching the Bulls against the Knicks
My honey marches in and ask if I think I'm slick
It seem she found my shirt with lipstick
I thought I could explain but then my story wouldn't stick
Incriminating pictures show me some other chick
It happened once before and she was tired of the tricks
She asked me if I can spell the word evict

Just the other day when I was rolling with my crew
Made a little flex around by Flatbush avenue
Calling to some honeys and sipping on my brew
That's when I saw the boys in blue
They pulled me to the side why I don't even have a clue
An' looking for a reason and they finally found a few
A case of ammunition with a loaded thirty two
I can't believe what I'm going through

there's a world out there that I wanna see
There's a man that I'm destined to be
I won't be stopped by the ghetto streets
I believe inside that I can't be beat

This life could be a ball and chain
If you let yourself get caught in the game
I had some friends who sold drugs for dough
But I don't intend to go down that road

Can rise in the highest celebration

Know that I am a ghetto child
But I can see the best in me, can you

All the ghettos around the world, dig this

One day I'm gonna change the world
Make a better place for every boy and girl
Everyone in need, homeless families
Have a place to sleep and food to eat

I?ll take every gun off the streets
So another tear won't be shed in grief
And every thug in every hood
I will make ?em change from bad to good

Shaggy,"What is cinco cervezas? I really don't know
But this pretty little senorita said it and I liked how it flowed
And what is venga mi casa? I really don't know
From the way that she smiled I could tell how the story would go

Chica Bonita, you're pretty like a rose
Mi senorita, me love how you a pose
Dame un beso, your hot and it shows
Toca mi vida and everybody knows

She's my Chica Bonita, you're pretty like a rose
Mi senorita, me love how you a pose
Dame un beso, your hot and it shows

Baby baby baby
Tell me what you wanna do and where you wanna go
Ain't no need to rush it baby, we can take it slow
I swear it must be Cupid shooting arrows with his bow
I notice in your eyes a certain glow

Have me wondering now
Is it really me or tell me do you feel the same?
I feel like I'm in love and I don't even know your name
I know what I am saying to you may sound pretty lame
Your love is like an everlasting flame

So, what is cinco cervezas? I really don't know

Lovely lady, would you please give me a signal
So I know you understand?
Maybe I should start by making gestures with my hand
Girl, you're like a rising star and I'm your biggest fan
My sweet Bonita diva with the tan

Got me thinking baby
We could make a life together on the ocean shore
Paradise is where you are, I'm ready to explore
Can never get enough of you, it's all about amour
And happiness is knocking at your door

So, what is cinco cervezas? I really don't know
But this pretty little senorita said it and I liked how it flowed
And what is venga mi casa? I really don't know

Shaggy,"I remember, wasn't so long ago
We had a one room shack and the livin' was low
And my Mama by herself raised me and my bro
Wasn't easy, but we did it with the little that go
Worked hard while the suckers cool every day
And kept her eyes on the stars when the skies were gray
Gave us drive to survive, really showed us the way
Now I really understood what she was tryin' to say

She said, ""Son there'll be times when the tides are high
And the boat may be rocky, you can cry
Just never give up
You can never give up uh-uh
In this life you could lead if you only believe
And in order to achieve what you need
You can never give up
You can never give up""

And this hope
That keep me holding on
And this hope
That makes me carry on

Home grown, couldn't have made it alone
I got a wonderful life, two kids on my own
With a strong foundation that was carved in stone
And my mama for the love that made my house a home
Made me wonder some time if this was meant to be
All this for a humble little guy like me
And all I ever really wanted was a family
To teach my kids the same value that she gave to me

She said ""Son there'll be times when the tides are high
And the boat may be rocky, you can cry
Just never give up
You can never give up uh-uh
In this life you could lead if you only believe
And in order to achieve what you need
You can never give up
You can never give up""

And this hope
That keep me holding on
And this hope
That makes me carry on

We nah turn no stepper, things a go better
Never make yourself be overcome by pressure
Cool ya me bredda, have faith instead a
Sid-dung and a watch an all a fight one another
Blaze like fire, nah go retire
Got naf sleep and a him inspire
We fi reach higher a that him require
Haffi mek we mark before the time is expire

And this hope
That keep me holding on
And on
And this hope
That makes me carry on
On and on

And this hope
That keep me holding on
And on
And this hope
That makes me carry on

And this hope
That keep me holding on
Keep it carry on, keep it carry on, yeah

Cause she knows that you are

I'm lost in the still of the night
Ain't no need to loose sight

See son it's never too late
The effort to correct is never to great
A family should stick together
One blood,
one love,
one heart 
Open arms welcome you at the gate
You're thinking that I'm crazy
I see through all them see your visions
I'm fried up with the premonitions
Black suits
Long faces
Sad words
Slow singing at the side of your grave

Now tell me how were you mislead so easily
When you was raised better by your family
You try to be something that you aren't meant to be
Your mammas on her knees
Pray to god every night
Cause she knows that you are

Lost in the still of the night
Ain't no need to loose sight
She'll be holding the light
I'm lost in the still of the night
Ain't no need to loose sight
She'll be holding the light

[Repeat: x2]
Whenever I'm low
All I need to know 
Is that you're there for me
You're down for me
My strength when I'm weak

[Repeat: x2]
Lost in the still of the night
Ain't no need to loose sight

And they wouldn't leave you if you say you saw a demon
And even though sometimes I am a little, little outta luck
And if I worry much I know my dog has got my back

And I know that even if it means he'd have to fly like a bird
I know he?ll be here for me now and match my word

We've got some work to do now
Scooby-Dooby-Doo, where are you?
We need some help from you now

You're not fooling me 'cause I can see

Shaggy,"Closest to me she must be a good child?
Don't ignore the signs, that's right
You be her teacher, taking

Shivering, she awakes in the cold sweat
Terrified so she speaks under her breathe
Makes a fake cry for help, she's a real mess
That's the sign of the stress, ma, listen to her

Heartbeats working overtime in her chest
Scared stiff from approaching footsteps
Ignoring the stains on her torn dress
Come now ma, listen to her

How could you put your own child in danger?
And turn around and take the words of a stranger
You didn't wanna face the facts so you blamed her
Too late ma, you should have listened to her

Gone, she's asleep, finally, she's at peace
With the angels
Gone, out of reach, finally, souls in peace
With the angels

She's fading like a delicate flower
Try to wash away the shame in the shower
Defending him left her feeling overpowered
You were wrong ma, you didn't listen to her

It was there in the words of the letter
Had you read it maybe things would be better
You let her down and I won't let you forget her
Save ya tears ma, you should have listened to her

How could you put your own child in danger?
And turn around and take the words of a stranger
You didn't wanna face the facts so you blamed her
Save ya tears ma, you didn't listen to her

Gone, she's asleep, finally, she's at peace

Gone, out of reach, finally, souls in peace

Why day, why day
Why day, why day

Gone, she's asleep, finally, she's at peace

Shaggy,"Ya, I gotta get real personal on this ya know, for me
[Incomprehensible] screamin' out two things

When I was young my ambition in life
Was to finish way ahead of the game
Such a shame ya'll payin' the price
In this race of fortune and fame

I really feel apologetic inside
Though you'd never think to give me the blame
It's when I look into your lives
I wonder if it was really worth all the pain

Now I know what it take in the heights of mistakes
Is it there in the mind of a child?
Though it's all for our sakes, still my heart, how it breaks
Every time that I see your smile, check it

Conversation on the phone is fine
But for me it could never replace
Being there to spend quality time
Tuck you in to see the smile on your face

So when you're old enough to read these lines
I hope you never find yourself in my place
I hope you never feel as lonely as I
And miss the warmth of your child's embrace

Now I know what it take in the heights of mistakes
Is it there in the mind of a child? No, no, no, no
Though it's all for our sakes, still my heart, how it breaks
Every time that I see your smile

Now I know what it takes, in the heights of mistakes
Is it there in the mind of a child? No, no, no, no
Though it's all for our sakes, still my heart, how it breaks
Every time that I see your smile

Now I know what it takes, in the heights of mistakes
Is it there in the mind of a child?
Though it's all for our sakes, still my heart, how it breaks

How many men did you have? Don't ask her that
Can you count on one hand? Don't ask her that
Am I like your last man? Don't ask her that
We on a need to know basis and you don't need to know

Back in the day were you a freak, don't ask her that
In the past hey did you creep? Don't ask her that
How you so good between the sheets? Don't ask her that
We on a need to know basis and you don't need to know

Go 'head do what you came to do
Wanna know all the things that I used to do
When I keep it on the real you get an attitude
You want the truth, you can't handle the truth

Go 'head do what you came to do
You want to follow my past well it's up to you
When I keep it on the real don't get an attitude
You want the truth, you can't handle the truth

Don't ask 'bout the past you should let some things be
No need to concern 'bout the man she has seen
You ask how many she tell you just three
Knowing that your ego can't handle thirteen

It's best not to ask 'bout her previous guys
Unless you are willin' to handle her lies
Especially when she's discussin' their size
You just might be in for a bigger surprise

You're diggin' for info that you really don't wanna hear
You're stirrin' the feelings that you know you can't really bare
So what if the answers you can prevent your biggest fear
Now ask yourself are you really prepared?

When I keep it on the real don't get an attitude

An expert, it seems when it comes to foreplay
The many positions she did made your day
I know you must wonder how she got that way
Don't ask you might not wanna hear what she'll say

Just look in the past and the ways you had fun
Would you wanna know when the things you had done
She might lose her cool and be tempted to run
So what heave you learned when it's all said and done

Go wey, yuh haffi stay 

If I stay, would you put an end 
To all the games you play 
Can you promise me 
That you will never stray 
Has to be a new beginning from today, 
Only way I will stay 
But if I go, 
This will be the final curtain of the show 
You have lost the best thing 
That you ever known 
Guess you have to learn 
To make it on your own 
Let me know stay or go 

Before you go let's analyze the situation 
I'm a typical Jamaican 
Why you layin' your frustration on me 
When we met it was a perfect combination 
But you know my reputation 
Don't know what you were expecting (of) me 
Fight back, you can fight 
Get things a go if yuh nuh like that 
Cause I know that 
When you (leave) you come right back 
Your new founded termination 
Sounds to me like desperation 
There's no ground for termination 

If I stay, would you put an end

For these women 
Who a plot like them a villain try the best 
To separate you from me 
I don't understand 
Just why the hell your cousin 
When you knew that she meant nothin' 
So what if she was your cousin 
You say fight back, 
How the hell could I resist 
When she's dressed like that 
Tell the truth I had to leave 
But she came right back 
Now you heard the explanation 
Taken to consideration 
It was sexual frustration 

If I stay, would you put a end 
To all the games you play 
Can you promise me 
That you will never stray 
Has to be a new beginning from today, 
Only way I will stay

But this is meant to be

Shaggy,"All through the night
I'll be awake and I'll be with you
All through the night
This precious time when time is new
Oh, all through the night today
Knowing that we feel the same without saying

We have no past, we won't reach back
Keep with me forward all through the night
And once we start the meter clicks
And it goes running all through the night
Until it ends, there is no end

All through the night
Stray cat is crying so stray cat sings back
All through the night
They have forgotten what by day they lack
Oh under those white street lamps
There is a little chance they may see

We have no past, we won't reach back
Keep with me forward all through the night
And once we start the meter clicks
And it goes running all through the night
Until it ends, there is no end

Oh the sleep in your eyes is enough
Let me be there let me stay there awhile

We have no past, we won't reach back
Keep with me forward all through the night
And once we start the meter clicks
And it goes running all through the night
Until it ends there is no end
Keep with me forward all through the night
And once we start the meter clicks
And it goes running all through the night
Until it ends there is no end",All Through the Night,2005
Shaggy,"Remember how you used to see me 
That day we met the butterflies 
Let me know I wasn't dreaming 
Pretending not to feel me 
While you walking down my street 
Playing hard to get 
I know you thought I wouldn't work that hard 
You didn't think I would let down my guard 
Remember how you didn't believe me 
When I told you that I thought you were my destiny 

[Chorus] 
Your love is like rain 
Come a little closer let me explain 
Your love is like rain 
Shower your love all over me 
Your love is like rain 
Lovin' so good hafi' shout your name 
Your love is like rain 
Who else is gonna make you feel this way 

I'm not tryin' to run your life 
All I need is you to set me free 
I know your boys think you're crazy 
Cause all you wanna' do is spend your time with me 
It's never too much 
Drown me in your love I don't need to breathe 
I'm like a flower I need you boy to come water me 

[Chorus: x2]",Rain,2006
Shaggy,"It's bordering on insanity
So blurred
So unclear
Then suddenly eyes focus and realize that
This man should not be here
It's funny how there's no remorse in the moment
But after it's over you wish you could disown it
And as you get up to tell this stranger to leave
The love of your life walks in and sees, everything

[Chorus]
And of all the things that you could have said
What was in your head?
I didn't mean to
All the thoughts running through your mind
All that you could find
I didn't mean to
And the pain of losing everything comes over you
I didn't mean to
All you can say is that 'you didn't mean to'
I didn't mean to

And it's reality now
Pictures of him and your baby
Smashed in broken glass all on the floor
With his suitcase in one hand, your little girl's hand in the other
You hear him say ""Mommy don't live us no more""
And it cuts like a knife but you can't blame him either
You're a mother, you're a wife, but you're also a cheater
Ooh girl, one silly moment of lust
Just cost you everything that you've ever loved

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
Oh, the clouds are rolling in
As you prepare to face this punishment and suffer the consequence
Such a price to pay
Was it really worth it?
And you fight back tears
As you watch him take the only thing you ever truly loved away
The tears in her eyes as she waves goodbye
Slowly kills you inside

[Chorus]",I Didn't Mean To,2006

I need your love

Now as I wake up in the mornin', meet the risin' sun
You're on my mind throughout the day
Could hardly get things done
It's that love that you give comparison to none
Cupid gave me a shot from a loaded gun

There is no love like this I've ever seen her with
Love strikes, got me all believe it
Sweaty palm and the tearful eye
The thought of you brings me butterflies

It's all about love

(Love, love, love, love)
I want your love
(Love, love, love, love)

I know I'm far from perfect, that's to my dismay
You complain that I'm so stuck in my ways
Insecurity is what I seldom display
It's unexplainable that love I feel for you each day

I told enough lies, it's amazin' that you're still with me
Most times my conscience gets the best of me
All the skirts that I used to chase
No one else can ever take your place

It's all about your love

'Cause it's the only way we ever will survive

It's a mad, mad world that we're living in
(Mad, crazy you know)
Gotta keep your heads up high, can't be giving in
Don't you let one day go by without praising the most High
'Cause it's the only way we ever will survive

Nuclear warfare, satellites everywhere
Mothers on welfare, what about Medicare?
Ethnic cleansing, freedom pending
Government spending, who are they defending?

Bankrolls on poles, anything to enroll
Spotlight's their goal, price paid their soul
Step back, retrack, notice where your life's at
(Where was it worth it?)

Got to heed the warning, see the storm that's forming
Not the time for stalling', look around it's so appalling'
Poor is the mentality that disregard humanity
Say no to this insanity, create a new reality

It's a mad, mad world that we're living in
Gotta keep your heads up high, can't be giving in
Don't you let one day go by without praising the most High
'Cause it's the only way we ever will survive

It's a mad, mad world that we're living in
Gotta keep your heads up high, can't be giving in
Don't you let one day go by without praising the most High
'Cause it's the only way we ever will survive

Rough life, 'nuff crime, youth them a do hard time
No guides, no sign, walking on a thin like
Sentenced, no trial, victim of a profile
No hope, more fight, wonder why we're hostile

False prophet make profit, focused on their pocket
White collar false docket, door open can't lock it
Politics, polytricks
