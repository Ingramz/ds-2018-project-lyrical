Trey Songz,"Girl, this is for you
Only for you

If I can't have you no one can
You think I'm crazy
Just tell me that you'll hold me down

Go again
I got you baby, I got you
You ain't never gon find another man
Just me, for you
Girl I'll probably die
If it took your love somewhere
Don't you even try, no
Want to take your love",Interlude4u,2012
Trey Songz,"Here we go, here again, here again
I wanna know, how you been, how you been
Such a surprise, didn't think you'd come back so soon
Got drink in my cup, got weed rolled up but I'm high off you tonight
Bet yo ass ain't think I will come so hard upon this Chapter V
I've toured the world and made some money, learned some different things
And now I'm here to show your body what these niggas cant
Your Panty Droppa has returned and I'm goin' alone
To please your body is my mission if you don't know
Just take our time I just wanna go nice and slow
First thing take off them clothes
But you can leave them panties on
You've had my love before
So you know I might make 'em soak

'Cause I'm your panty wetter
I'm your panty wetter
You ain't gotta take 'em off
Just pull it to the side
Don't you try to run girl
Ain't no place to hide
I'm your panty wetter
And you know it don't, it won't
Get no better
No one is gonna get you wetter

Here we are you and me, you and me
A special show made for two to see
We 'bout to make the best love you've ever dreamed
But you gon' have to come up out them clothes
You can leave them panties on
You've had this love before
So you know I 'bout to make you soak

'Cause I'm your panty wetter
I'm your panty wetter
You ain't gotta take 'em off
Just pull it to the side
Don't you try to run girl
Ain't no place to hide

No one is gonna get you better than a fountain
Waterfall off my mountain
It's such beauty when we be

I'm the pipe girl you're the leak
It's only one thing left you can do for me
Take 'em off, take 'em off, take 'em off
Please",Panty Wetter,2012
Trey Songz,"We just broke up this shit is kinda new
I admit I'll still be ridin' through
I heard you got another, nigga too
I seen his Benz that 2009 shit
Plus your home girl out here fucking
She let all my friends hit
That's off subject I know fuck it
Bring them papers keep them dutches
Tell 'em haters they some busters
Bad bitch then I bags it
Like I work out in Publix
Got plenty girls so many girls
And pieces of me love it
But some pieces of me doesn't
Guess that's a players nature
Guess I holla at you later
Are you really done, I mean really done with me?
You said you will be here counting millions with me
Now you gone, my baby's gone you're gone
And I want for you to come on home
I'm going crazy

But I can't act that, fresh snap back
My cup is full of Hennessy just me and my Bentley
Windows down got a joint rolled
Where I'm 'bout to go a nigga don't know

But I'm, but I'm sick of playing hard
I give up girl, sick of fighting this war
Cause I'm losing if I'm losing you
Can't shake, heart break, can't fake baby wait
I'mma say it, I admit it girl I've been a fool
Sick of playing hard, I'm sick of playing hard

I'm sick of playing hard but that's something that I can't help
Fucking all these broads I'm disgusted with my damn self
My back you would massage I miss how your hands felt
But the show's goes on, and that's even if the band left
Catch me in Miami Puerto Rican with a dancer
Talk is something sexy but I never understand her
Te amo mami but yo no se, I'm lonely mami I'm not OK

But I can't act that, fresh snap back
My cup is full of Hennessy just me and my Bentley
Windows down anotha joint rolled
Where I'm 'bout to go a nigga don't know

But I'm, but I'm sick of playing hard
I give up girl, sick of fighting this war
Cause I'm losing if I'm losing you
Can't shake, heart break, can't fake baby wait
I'mma say it, I admit it girl I've been a fool
Sick of playing hard, I'm sick of playing hard

I'm so sick of frontin' like I don't miss you when you leave
And laying in bed at night you even sexy girl when you sleep
Feels a little crazy lying here alone
But I'm stuck on that nigga shit
That I be on, that I be on
And its that nigga shit
That got me smoking, driving, drinking
Girl I'm tripping, blowing up your phone

But I'm, but I'm sick of playing hard
I give up girl, sick of fighting this war
Cause I'm losing girl
Can't shake, heart break, can't fake baby wait
I'mma say it, I admit it girl I've been a fool
Sick of playing hard, I'm sick of playing hard

So uh

Trey Songz,"She grew up without a father
Never knew how to love a man
She's addicted to breaking hearts and moving on
So I never really stood a chance
And a sparkle lid your eyes
They shine so flawless I'm amazed
Blinded by an angel's face
It's the sweetest poison in one kiss
And now you got the venom in your veins
Believing everything her lips say

Pretty girls lie
Lipstick in her smile
Makes you want to believe
But pretty girls hide
Pain so deep inside
She can't even see
Pretty girls lie

Pretty girls lie

Got you walking through a maze, yeah
Eyes closed tryin' to find your way
Got your arms reached out
Hoping she gon' make a sound
Cause she don't wanna be found
But she'll tell you come anyway
And you don't know the difference
From the real or the fake
Devil in a dress, but an angel in the face
They're forever yours but it's only for the day
Is it real when you calling my name?

Pretty girls lie
Lipstick in her smile
Makes you want to believe
But pretty girls hide
Pain so deep inside
She can't even see
Pretty girls lie

Wanna give the benefit of the doubt
The best in her, I wanna help bring it out
I know something's missing inside
If you let me I can show and prove
Girl there ain't no running from the truth
She says I'll be there
Girl don't just tell me what I wanna hear

Pretty girls lie
Lipstick in her smile
Makes you want to believe
But pretty girls hide
Pain so deep inside
She can't even see
Pretty girls lie

That's a pretty face and
She did find a way
That's a beautiful girl
Lost in the world
Can't trust what she says
After so many break-ups and make-ups in life
Could've been making love and end up in a fight
Don't tell me why
Pretty girls lie",Pretty Girl's Lie,2012
Trey Songz,"I cant really explain what it is she does
But um, whatever it is
It's um, simply, simply amazing

Her head is on my chest, sun comes rolling in
We're lost in these covers, and all I feel is skin
I slowly kiss your face, beautiful in every way, you are (you are)

See I'm a man that don't believe in much
But I'll be damned, if I don't believe in us
And how we play a fight up in the bathroom
Next thing I know I'm making love to you
Girl, promise me you'll never change

She ain't perfect, but shes worth it
Every breath I breathe, for the life I need
And I know I might not deserve it
But she loves me, and it's simply amazing (you are),
Simply amazing (you are), simply amazing (you are)
And she loves me, and it's simply amazing, amaze-amazing

The girl's a work of art, and I cant help but stare
With a smile like the sunset, and the ocean as her hair
Ooh what she do ain't fair ooh
She know me better, than I know myself, mhm\

See I'm a man, that don't believe in much
But I'll be damned if I don't believe in us
Like when I said I loved you for the first time
And the tears dropped on your eyes
Girl, don't you ever change

'Cause she ain't perfect, but shes worth it
Every breath I breathe for the life I need
And I know might not deserve it
But she loves me, and it's simply amazing (you are)
Simply amazing (you are), simply amazing (you are)
And she loves me

There is nothing, in this world
That can keep me away from you
And there's nobody that could ever compare to you
Ooh

She ain't perfect (no she ain't), but she's worth it (she is)
Every breath I breathe, for the life I need
And I know I might not deserve it
But she loves me and it's simply amazing (you are)

And she loves me, and it's simply amazing",Simply Amazing,2012
Trey Songz,"Picture this coming home from a long day's work, no food is there
Picture this steady trying to show the world you're worth, and nobody cares
Picture this no kissing, ain't no touching, there's no hugging
And in the evening no good loving

Ain't no pretty picture you can paint
Ain't no way this life would be the same
I'm telling you a man can't be a man without a woman
And you can try as hard as you can, but we ain't nothing without a woman
Living in a world so cold, so cold
The fire burns through my soul, without a woman

What if you had no hands to rub upon your shoulders
And in the morning she's not there to fix your folgers
You're sick as a dog right now
Kids running all around that house
No one to help you out
Picture this you paying these bills all by yourself
No one to tell you watch your health
But keep it girl, you might as well
Picture this 'cause your world don't spin without her
And hers gon' spin without you

Ain't no pretty picture you can paint
Ain't no way this life would be the same
I'm telling you a man can't be a man without a woman
And you can try as hard as you can, but we ain't nothing without a woman
Living in a world so cold, so cold
The fire burns through my soul, without a woman

Say hello to pain, goodbye to love
Hello to rain the sun will never shine again
There'll be no Wednesday movie nights
No make-ups after fights
Girl I'll make it right
I'm lonely with my pillow
Your car's not in the drive way
Clothes ain't in the closet
Girl I'm broken hearted
Come and find me 'cause I'm lost without my woman
And I know that a man can't be a man without a woman
You can try hard as you can
But you won't be nothing without a woman
Living in a world so cold, so cold
The fire burns through my soul, without a woman

See baby life ain't life
And living ain't living
Without my woman
Hurting inside
Without my woman no, no, no",Without a Woman,2012

Trey Songz,"The doors open and everybody turns around
To see you walk down the aisle in your pretty white gown
You're holding you daddy's arm, your tears begin to fall
And both of our lives are about to change forever
Everybody stands, she reaches out her hand the preacher says
We're gathered here today and I

I almost lose it, when I hear you say, ""I do""
And I'm so in love with you, baby
I almost lose it, when I see that pretty face
It's more than I can take

I wonder if she's nervous, or will she get cold feet
She wears a smile, as the diamond shines from her wedding ring
I hope it's everything you wanted, you deserve the best
Always knew I'd be the reason, for your wedding dress
So beautiful the way you read your vows, then the wedding bells ring, and I

I almost lose it, when I hear you say, ""I do""
And I'm so in love with you, baby
I almost lose it, when I see that pretty face
It's more than I can take

As the tears roll down your cheek, it's impossible for me to speak
My heart is beating fast, and my knees are feeling weak
So speak now or forever hold your peace
Can't help but wonder from my seat if he know she was meant for me

Trey Songz,"Shorty bad as my son is, pretty face and no stomach
Was the city’s most wanted ‘til I said gimme yo number
Youngest nigga I’m stuntin’, no more Civics from Honda
Money comin’ in bundles, that’s the reason she wanna

Lay up, lay up
Lay up, lay up

I keep a vest on my chest, to cover my heart
I’d rather fuck in the light, ‘fore I make love in the dark
'Cause she was fuckin’ me right, it felt like love from the start
Was gettin’ money on tour, so we was lovin’ for fall
But first we go together then break up, tears drip on her makeup
Fuck all night ‘til we wake up, and like George Gervin we lay up
'Cause all them lies I made up, it’s big checks no pay cut

Floor seats in Florida, Heat game vs Lakers
Shorty on my team now, it was us versus them haters
And everybody they talk bad, when they talk that she take up
She mess our flavor, young boy get paper,
And all I know is go hard, and every time
I touch that ball I go swish

She know it’s game time when I do it like that
When I pass it to her baby throw it right back
She can get the lay up, all night
She be tryna lay up, all right
And when I shoot I don’t miss (Don’t miss), I don’t miss (Don’t miss)
I don’t miss when I do it now
She could get the lay up, all night
She be tryna lay up, all right

Sittin’ back with this paper fallin’ in my lap
Feelin’ isolated nothin’ but them hundred stacks
When your money up tell me who you’re supposed to trust
Every night a different woman, fuck your money up
My bank account in shape, I could run with Puff
I came to put you down shorty so what the fuck is up
Since I met her she can’t keep that pussy off me
On the pill, Ima kill that pussy softly
Back to back time to show you how a gangster move
Keys to the pad, talkin’ infinity pools
V12’s ain’t a thang, time to change your name
Paper stuffed in her purse can’t hear her phone ring

She know it’s game time when I do it like that
When I pass it to her baby throw it right back
She can get the lay up, all night
She be tryna lay up, all right
And when I shoot I don’t miss (Don’t miss), I don’t miss (Don’t miss)
I don’t miss when I do it now
She could get the lay up, all night
She be tryna lay up, all right

Homie picture me rollin’, all them bitches be on me
They be fishin’ for compliments, I’m just fishin’ off Boca
Made a grip off them vocals, got a gift with the vocals
So much over these hoes should have been on a poster
Infatuated to say the least
He lay it weak, I lay you once you lay a week
Wale a freak, he know it doe, no go with hoes
When it come to showin’, I am working with totem pole
That’s head on head, she give me head, I give her glow
I’m in her body, I’m in her head like quote unquote
The coldest flow, the flyest combination was voila
Au revoir to my rivals, double M genius shotta

She know it’s gametime when I do it like that
When I pass it to her baby throw it right back
She can get the lay up, all night
She be tryna lay up, all right
And when I shoot I don’t miss (Don’t miss), I don’t miss (Don’t miss)
I don’t miss when I do it now
She could get the lay up, all night
She be tryna lay up, all right

From the night to the morn’, yeah she tryna lay
Got a freaky, freaky game and she tryna play
Couple more shots baby can you make it stay, stay up
Lay up, lay up
Might just slap the backboard, give you what you ask for

Sittin' on my thrown and my crown, can't separate me from that

Make it to trial, you don't win, indirectly you lose
You bad, makin' that move, your best move
Or end up in the pen like the next dude

They even fewer, they don't want it, now they get through
To get to the level you on, hard to do homes
More nigga do a lot of right, right before they do wrong
And you gone, out of there, nigga see you later
'Less you beat 'em a year later, [?] tell 'em
Who the people want

When they see you, they might judge you
Give you side eyes, they don't trust you
Misunderstand you, call you trouble
I understand you, it's just a hustle
Just keep starin' it, let it bubble
You're my brother, I'm not above you
Remember me I'm so there
Don't make us have to go there
Turn and sing it

Get T.I. in the shack, handshake it with 5
Still politicin' with 6, this probably as real as it gets
And bitch I would never be hit with by intellectual weaponry
Ain't no one gon' disrespect me, or compromise my integrity
Say what my pedigree? Silent, guess you talkin' bout I shot it
Bitch you never been to war like I ain't never been to college, c'mon
Fuck what you tellin' me, done lied chill with it
I know folk from where you from, spent months in jail with 'em
Said you [?] took a plea, he ain't tell but you woulda
Let him suck a nigga raw, they ain't kill you bet they shoulda
And a robbery for me is like a suicide mission
Suicide, you should commit it, save a G a life sentence, swear
You and me ain't even fit to compare
I ain't make it all these years on no wing and a prayer
Starin' a bigger nigga out while he standing right there
Got a problem I'ma handle it right there
Who the people want

When they see you, they might judge you
Give you side eyes, they don't trust you
Misunderstand you, call you trouble
I understand you, it's just a hustle

Seem to be the time that I frown the most
Can't believe that we're still survivin'
Cause I'm slowly breaking down
Even when I hold you close
And if I lose you
I'm afraid I would lose who
Who I gave my love to

What you doin' tonight?
Oh shit

Shawty so cold, pussy winter fresh
Reservations to eat and you my dinner guest
Shawty clean up nice, never been a mess
Could take a little pain, I see them tattoos in her flesh
But I ain't try to hurt her, ‘cause I've always been the best
At making my shawty feel it till she feel it in her chest
Sex excellent, get a hundred when I test
I'm a fan of her talent, so I've always been impressed
Sex in the city on my black satin sheets
Wet as Hurricane Sandy on the Manhattan streets
Lit a few candles like my power hadn't reached
Then I took you places that her last nigga hadn't reached
Bitch so bad know her parents went through hell
Smart mouth when we argue, you would swear she went to Yale
I wanna touch her, not using my hands
Make her dance without using the bands

Call me crazy, shit at least you call me
Feels better when you let it out, don't it, boy?
Know its easy to get caught up in the moment
When you say it 'cause you're mad and you take it all back
Then we fuck all night till things get right
Then we fuck all night till things get right

The club popping but she ain't trying go there
Her friends know where she going every time she tell them “nowhere”
I'm the only one that get up in that VIP
My money grown, baby, ain't no need to see id
Slide her somethin' just to come through, host money
At least niggas know you're getting to the most money
Club my place, you wear what you wanna wear
But you're overdressed if you're wearing underwear
Now turn up, couple J's to burn up
Couple spots to hide out, now let that playlist ride out
Where I live on Sunday, your place Monday
Her hand in my pants, call that Al Bundy
Pull it out like a pistol yo, kissin' on the balls like the dick a mistletoe
Tell her do the thing I like, best she listen, yo
Bad bitch good girl around the Christmas, though (Nice)

Call me crazy, shit at least you call me

Pussy sweeter than some fresh fruit
She gushin' I drink the best juice
I'm drinking till nothing left too
And she playing with herself, too
I been thinking about her all day
She perform like it's Broadway
Yeah, we hop in the range, she off top with the brain
Got the windows down, broad day
Just look at her, spectacular
Throw her on the stove, flip her like a spatula
Other niggas want her, but you see them niggas whack to her
Side bitch tripping ‘cause I don't ever get back to her
My bitch like bitches, but none of my bitches bad to her
She's a trigger, I never seen her with a bad bitch
Unless she's meeting on these other bitches average
Hundred percent real all these bitches is plastic
Moroccan goddess, she walk like she need her ass kissed
Walk like she need her ass kissed
Diced pineapples, super fine at you
If she's giving head, She's throwing her mind at you
Fuck these other bitches, nigga, she don't mind that you do
Might just wanna watch, I ain't taking time at you, dudes
Never faking, why they hella front?
Keep it real with her, yeah, that's all she ever wants
Somethin' bout the alchemy, she don't ever disappoint
London on the balcony, we 'bout to smoke another joint
Miami on the yacht, she pulling on my pistol saying how she love my cock
Metaphoric bliss, shawty, you the shit
Couple days with her, man, that's all I ever get
Yeah she got a little sister, that's all she ever with
Game like a nigga, man, that's wall she ever spit
Montreal was our first time, swear pussy just like the first lines
Scars on my back, she don' left couple there
spent a couple stacks, I don' put a couple pair
Try to bag mine, my nigga I double dare
Never retract statements, nigga, I'm never scared
Niggas be switching up, but nigga, I'm never weird
Back on another leer
I leave niggas here, all in another year
All in another lane, all in another gear
All of you niggas lame, all of your niggas here
Listen up, bitch niggas bitching up
I guess you're doing what you're supposed to
Let a real nigga hold you
Back to my baby girl, though, I just need you in my world, yo

Call me crazy, shit at least you call me

With an ass like Serena and a face like Aaliyah
Redbone in some red bottoms
She ain't finished college, she a head doctor
Bouncing ass while I'm getting high
As propellers on a helicopter

Roll a pack out, took a light hit, might nap
Got a thick bitch with a trip stick I’ma smack

Feelin' so global, I think I need agent
Ratchet on deck and they know I’m gon’ stunt
I’m tryna get head while smoking a blunt
Take her to my hotel, beat the pussy up
I don’t know her name, but I wanna fuck
Along came Molly, then came Doobie
Then codeine in a styrofoam cup
See me in the club, bands pop, they poppin'
Do it real good, might take you shoppin'
All these racks can’t fit in my pocket
Keep that stack, hundred K in the stocking
Then it’s back to my room, she come out her dress
Slob on my knob, think you know the rest

But I keep these girls in check

All he do is let you down, does he care?
How your smile disappear
How many times you cried in a year
Is it love, or the pride and the fear
Did you try to interfere
How she gonna dive off a pier
With some concrete shoes on their heel (I’ll arrange that)
Hope they know they talking loud, blowing smoke
When it’s clear I’ll be standing right here (turn the lights on)
Ever since we met, you done had the best (that's right)
Wait a little longer it got better than that
Ok, I gave everything that I had in my check
Never held back, was you telling em that?
Man, I’m the answer to the question, where them felonies at?
Don’t have me waiting for the cat like where the hell is he at
Aye the love of my life, you gone forever be that

Now we in the sand having lunch on me
Tell the girl don't let your feet get wet
We about to grab some drinks and head to my condo
You can be my weekend guest
I'm in her head so I know we're bout to get started
One thing led to the next, now she got her hands all over my body
I ain't trying to stop and I know she with it
I can see it in her eyes she been down from the beginning
And she can't leave me alone cause I drive her body crazy
I done gave her a little taste now she wanna have my babies

Chilling in Miami and I met a little freak
Got three bad friends and they all on me
And me and baby girl been chilling all week
And all we do is fuck, drink, and sleep
Yes, all we do is fuck, drink, and sleep
All we do is fuck, drink, and sleep
Chilling in Miami and I met a little freak
And all we do is fuck, drink, and sleep

Now we on the balcony chilling
She loving the view and we smoke
I'm loving it too while I stroke
Got the stars looking down on us
Do it til the sunrise up
Beat, beat, beat, take a drink, go to sleep
She a freak, she can get it right up, get it right up
Man shorty like to energize up
She just wanna ride, she ain't never tired
She cooking naked, eggs and some bacon
After I eat that I treat that then eat that again, and again, and again
I ain't trying to stop and I know she with it
I can see it in her eyes she been down from the beginning
And she can't leave me alone cause I drive her body crazy

Chilly Chill, yo homie mack the track move 
And I'll jack any Tom, Dick and Hank 
That's the name of the suckers I done ganked 
I get away from a copper 
Drop a dime, I'll break you off somethin proper 
With the L-E-N-see-H-M-O-be	 
T-Bone and that's J.D. 
And here's how we'll greet ya 
Stop fool, come off that beat ya 
Feel dumb cause you're caught in the dark 
(ya lil nuttin ass mark) 
Raise up, cause you can't' have it back 
You said ""I ain't never got gaffled like that"" 
Off the end of the gat you choke 
Short Dog's in the house ""Whattup loc?"" 
Nuttin' but a come up 
Gimme that bass, and don't try to run up 
'Cause you'll get banked somethin' sweet 
Ice Cube and the Lench Mob, is jackin' for beats 

Huh, and even if you're down with my crew 
Yo Chuck man, I don't understand this man 
You got to slow down
I jack them too 
And then we'll freak it 
Kick that bass, and look what we did 
Fade the grade, played, and made a few mil 
And I keep stealin 
Ice Cube'll make it funky 
But right about now - let's get up in the hump
But I don't party and shake my butt 
I leave that to the brothers with the funny haircuts 
And it'll drive you nuts 
Steal your beat, and give it that gangsta touch 
Like jackin' at night 
Say hi to the three fifty-seven I'm packin' 
And it sounds so sweet 
Ice Cube and the Lench Mob, is jackin' for beats 

Ice Cube, will take a funky beat and reshape it 
Locate a dope break, and then I break it 
And give it that gangsta lean 
Dead in your face as I turn up the bass 
I make punk suckers run and duck because 
I don't try to hide cause you know that I love to 
Jack a fool for his beat and then I'm Audi 
So when I come to your town don't crowd me 
Cause I know, you're gonna want to kick it with me 
But I know, none of y'all can get with me 
So you think you're protected 
Well you are til you put a funky beat on a record 
Then I have to show and prove and use your groove 
Cause suckers can't fade the Cube 
And if I jack you and you keep comin' 
I'll have you marks a 100 Miles and Running!

Here we are as in olden days
Happy golden days of yore
Faithful friends who are dear to us
Gather near to us once more
Through the years we all will be together
If the fates allow
So hang a shining star upon the highest bough
And have yourself a merry little Christmas now",Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas,2009

Late in the afternoon
What am I doing here at all?
Ain't no doubt about it
I'm losing you

Somehow the wires have crossed
Communication's lost
Can't even get you on the telephone
Just got to shout about it
I'm losing you

Here in the valley of indecision
I don't know what to do
I feel you slipping away
I feel you slipping away
I'm losing you
I'm losing you

You say you're not getting enough
But I remind you of all that bad stuff
So what the hell am I supposed to do?
Just put a band-aid on it?
And stop the bleeding now
Stop the bleeding now

I know I hurt you then
But that was way back when
And well, do you still have to carry that cross?
Don't want to hear about it
I'm losing you
I'm losing you",I'm Losing You,1988
Trial,"With empty minds and vacant stares
Our lifeless generation is drawn
Toward the illusions of endless offered bait
The same selective vision

Let boxcars carry millions to their cremation
Inaction masked by pseudo satisfaction
So many lives have burned away
""Another night with nothing to do"" is an infection

When anger has no motive and force has no direction
A lack of self control invites every distraction
From the holocausts we'd see and a world in agony
1944 through 1998: children dead at Birkenau

Or Tibetans laid to waste
Excuses become our legacy
Postponing introspection through denial and self rejection
There is no inevitable oppresiion

We are digging our own graves
Afraid of what we feel so our lives remain the same
Uphold the status quo as if there's someone else to blame
Who will cast away our ashes after we've thrown

Ourselves into the flames?
""I can always do it tomorrow""
Well you might as well be dead today
This is my revolution

The epitaph of our collective grave will read that
""work never made us free""
Our strength maintained by never giving in
We have so much to lose so little time left to begin

For even when we're gone
The effects of our legacy will still remain
So we've got to break it
In time alone as the years go by what I feel can't be denied

When tension builds and nothing gets changed
I strive to understand and redefine this rage
And fight for a new legacy",Legacy,1999
Trial,"Facing brutality I struggle with morality
I don't think that I can take it anymore
Indoctrinated into cultural norms functionless forms:
""Dominate and bleed infect with greed"" and we succumb...

I aggressive inherently am the illegitimate child
Of the gun intertwined with the dollar sign
And now as I walk through the valley of the shadow of death
I have become your evil and your hate is within me

For the rod and the staff have taught me all to well
These hands would drip with blood
If I traded truth for certainty
Power beckons to the unsure and afraid

The atavists of ignorance who initiate
Our bodies cast the shadow of everyone who has ever lived
And all the gods all the demons all the heavens
And all the hells are within us...

But that I privileged revolutionary could prescribe rites
Of passage for all? in preparing bloody defenses
Let our lineage remain clear:Armenia, Nanking, East Timor,
Cambodia, Rwanda, Iraq, Kosovo the shattered lives

And battered wives, underscored by forceful lies
Are inside of us, inside of me
I aggressive inherently could destroy humanity

Want or want not
With no easy way out",One Step Away,1999
Trial,"The wreckage of humanity has been strewn across the land
And now the hour of desperation is at hand
We the maggots feed off the dead
Seeking solace in a bed of broken glass

We bleed infected water
Beneath bright skins of polished steel
Through empty, yearning, starved and frustrated hearts
Which long for risk and reason

This is a standard and sterile half-life to lead
Empty facades conceal slow decay
Within these new dark ages which breed discontent
To give up all hope to see the dawn

Reveals a victims face beneath the veneer
Struggling to show that it's been wronged
Led astray by the myths of the father
With ancient wounds often ignored

Fighting for scraps from the table
While slowly we rot on the floor
Struggling for balance amid these unholy lies
Reflecting terror and chaos

We are born into suffering
With constructs, icons, idols and eyes
Which manifest and forecast our fear of our own demise
But on the eve of the apocalypse

You can burn these words into my flesh:
""we are the tortured and insane disillusioned and mundane
Unknown and unnamed desperate and enslaved
And we want something more""",Reflections,1999
Trials And Tribulations,"Rest in peace to the innocent children who were shot in the back
Running from the military, Junta hot on their tracks
For the love that why their uncle packs a bomb in their bags
What the fuck, you'd do the same with no options in hand
So stop with the wack raps you illiterate stale
Horse shit, you just a piss in the gale force winds
Battling me like I have to start busting for you
I'm like a suspect package, I got nothing to prove
Fuck it, I'll serve you straight from the kitchen
And kill your fly shit like Norman Bates with a pigeon
Listen. I'm deaf and blind to your fallacy war
Like a land mine child victim all bandaged and sore
Damage and break you down until your spirit is vanquished
Like traditional ownership does to indigenous factions
It's more than just black and white, like racism
Cause the face of hate appears when you face the mirror
This more than people starving to eat
Cause food for thought is running short in this marketed scene
It's hard to believe when you feel like smashing the mirror
But Charlie Chimp will pick you up like an angry gorilla

Yeah I'm back in that pattern
I sit up late with a spliff and wait for the magic to happen
Just for rapping wack you're catchin a slappin
I'll put you under pressure like a pilot with cracks in his cabin
Have another shot, see if you can take this spot
I'm a play strategically and take everything you got
Ciecmate! Game over, now you know the deal
Here with my bro's and we're pro's in our chosen fields
Standing tall like a wall to wall, public letter blockbuster
Got a lust for life, plus a lot of love for those I trust with my life
I'm a live my life like I like on any given night and anything else isn't right
Time's ticking by, time's making changes, time's turning friends into strangers
I'm trying to find what the aim is, but time's limited
I've gotta make payments and for everyone, everyday it's the same shit
Big brother wants us all to put it in a statement
But it's built on lies like the Bush administration
The media be feeding ya and we just believe it huh?
Behind the curtain men are getting greedier
We need to peel the curtain back and hurt em bad
And then spread the wealth around to all those who've been getting held down
Can I get some help now? Or can I get a hell yeah?
I'm saying this for everybody's welfare

""Now, may these MC's rest in peace""
""Rest in peace""
[Big Daddy Kane:] ""may these MC's rest in peace
Because when I come to town, the population decrease""

Rest in peace, two thousand and six shit changes quickly
Def to all man so I'm trained in lip read
Pick me like a gypsy picking a pocket
Depict me like David Hicks holding that rocket
A mix breed of Scottish and a modern day Australia's
Home but Mundine treats us like an alien, no
Man fuck that
Singing Waltzing Matilda with my rucksack
Cut back on the ego, leave rap to the albino
Rip you quicker than teeth wrapped around a T-bone
See know evil speech insightful
Solid gold heat like Hussein's rifle
I'm spiteful, only loyal if it's like that
Starve man's best friend, he's gonna bite back
What, it's just the way that it is
Dig your grave like letting Michael J. play with your kids
I can't live in this world full of rock heads
Finding a good one like finding the Loch Ness
Monster, and not Kody Scott
But down for my team and known what I got
When it's my shot, take it never look back
Or ever make it, dedicated to my fate a known gladiator
Yeah your favourite, I run with wind
Pauly Poltergeist and the Brothers Grimm, yeah you know me

Rest in peace bottom feeders, the scourge of the earth
Proof God doesn't need us, from fetus to birth
First. my mums didn't plan me, so meet plan b
The worker bee, Ron Burgendy where the pants be
Quite a big deal, 90 something kilo
Aim for the best but got Shaq at the free throw
Overweight. Shit I can't hold a job but I can hold a steak
Wash it down with a bunch of brown bottles
Plutonic made it for snake charmers
The bass bang harder than face planting in chain armour
Heavy metal, hammers banging the hang over
In my headspace, until it's dead weight
Until the next day, return of the Jedi
Sun up to sun down, return of the red eye

Tribo de Jah,"We all came out to Montreux
On the Lake Geneva shoreline
To make records with a mobile
We didn't have much time
Frank Zappa and the Mothers
Were at the best place around
But some stupid with a flare gun
Burned the place to the ground
Smoke on the water, fire in the sky

They burned down the gambling house
It died with an awful sound
Funky Claude was running in and out
Pulling kids out the ground
When it all was over
We had to find another place
But Swiss time was running out
It seemed that we would lose the race
Smoke on the water, fire in the sky

We ended up at the Grand Hotel
It was empty cold and bare
But with the Rolling truck Stones thing just outside
Making our music there
With a few red lights and a few old beds
We make a place to sweat
No matter what we get out of this
I know we'll never forget

Tribute Band Karaoke,"There's a lady who's sure
All that glitters is gold
And she's buying a stairway to heaven
When she gets there she knows
If the stores are all closed
With a word she can get what she came for
Oh oh oh oh and she's buying a stairway to heaven

There's a sign on the wall
But she wants to be sure
'Cause you know sometimes words have two meanings
In a tree by the brook
There's a songbird who sings
Sometimes all of our thoughts are misgiving

Ooh, it makes me wonder
Ooh, it makes me wonder

There's a feeling I get
When I look to the west
And my spirit is crying for leaving
In my thoughts I have seen
Rings of smoke through the trees
And the voices of those who standing looking

Ooh, it makes me wonder
Ooh, it really makes me wonder

And it's whispered that soon, If we all call the tune
Then the piper will lead us to reason
And a new day will dawn
For those who stand long
And the forests will echo with laughter

If there's a bustle in your hedgerow
Don't be alarmed now
It's just a spring clean for the May queen
Yes, there are two paths you can go by
But in the long run
There's still time to change the road you're on
And it makes me wonder

Your head is humming and it won't go
In case you don't know
The piper's calling you to join him
Dear lady, can you hear the wind blow
And did you know
Your stairway lies on the whispering wind

And as we wind on down the road
Our shadows taller than our soul
There walks a lady we all know
Who shines white light and wants to show
How everything still turns to gold
And if you listen very hard
The tune will come to you at last
When all are one and one is all
To be a rock and not to roll
And she's buying the stairway to heaven",Stairway to Heaven,2007

I'm a man who's burnin' for you
The mistakes I've made have been chased away to the bottom of the ocean blue
I'm a brand new man in a foreign land, I'm a man who's feelin' that fire
And it's all so clear when I'm standing here at the peak of my desire

So won't you move me like you used to
I want the world to know I burn for you

I feel revived again, I am alive again
(Burnin' for you) You got me lifted and lifted you lift me up
I feel revived again, I'm energized again
(Burnin' for you) You got me lifted and lifted you lift me up

Woke up in a sweat, those ghosts in my head
Had a grip, but I slipped on by
It's a whole new day as the darkness fades
And the sun's climbing in the sky
I concede, my love, that I need your love
I'm before you, a broken man
And it's only you, no substitutes who can renew this soul again

You got me higher than Kilimanjaro
Got me believin' I can ""save the day""
I'm up and running like their ain't no tomorrow
I'd rather burn for you than fade away
I'd rather burn for you than go my way

I'm a whole new guy with a whole new vibe
Changed inside - more flame in the fire
Can't stop, won't stop praying for desire
Like the bunny on the screen feel so energized
Old shell gone without a trace, new face
No more shortness of breath, new pace
Live life now without the taste of fear

Count the cost, take up your cross

Fear got the best of me

Worried about tomorrow
'Cause the weight of everything I don't know
Is so heavy I can't sleep

Even when I don't know what to pray

But what I know
Is You my God are real
No matter how I feel
You've never let me go
But what I know
Is there will never be a day
You aren't just a breath away
And through it all I've gotta hold
To what I know

I could throw my fist in the air
Demanding answers
But despite of all the questions
I'm still giving You my life
And if it doesn't turn out like I think it should

To hope that keeps on saying

There'll be no dinners by candlelight,

So I made up my mind, it must come to an end
Look at me now, will I ever learn?
I don't know how but I suddenly lose control
There's a fire within my soul
Just one look and I can hear a bell ring
One more look and I forget everything 

[Chorus]
Mamma mia, here I go again
My my, how can I resist you?
Mamma mia, does it show again
My my, just how much I've missed you?

Yes, I've been brokenhearted
Blue since the day we parted
Why, why did I ever let you go?
Mamma mia, now I really know
My my, I could never let you go 
I've been angry and sad about things that you do
I can't count all the times that I've told you ""we're through""
And when you go, when you slam the door
I think you know that you won't be away too long
You know that I'm not that strong
Just one look and I can hear a bell ring
One more look and I forget everything

Yes, I've been brokenhearted
Blue since the day we parted

""Bye bye"" doesn't mean forever

The love you gave me. nothing else can save me, S.O.S.
When you're gone, how can I even try to go on?
When you're gone though I try how can I carry on?
 
You seem so far away though you are standing near
You made me feel alive but something died I fear
I really tried to make it out. I wish I understood

If I tell a joke, you've probably heard it before
But I have a talent, a wonderful thing
Cause everyone listens when I start to sing
I'm so grateful and proud
All I want is to sing it out loud

So I say
Thank you for the music, the songs I'm singing
Thanks for all the joy they're bringing
Who can live without it, I ask in all honesty
What would life be?
Without a song or a dance what are we?
So I say thank you for the music
For giving it to me

Mother says I was a dancer before I could walk
She says I began to sing long before I could talk
But I've often wondered, how did it all start?
Who found out that nothing can capture a heart
Like a melody can?
Well, whoever it was, I'm a fan

So I say
Thank you for the music, the songs I'm singing
Thanks for all the joy they're bringing
Who can live without it, I ask in all honesty
What would life be?
Without a song or a dance what are we?
So I say thank you for the music
For giving it to me

I've been so lucky, I am the girl with golden hair
I wanna sing it out to everybody
What a joy, what a life, what a chance!

So I say
Thank you for the music, the songs I'm singing
Thanks for all the joy they're bringing

When I made up my mind, my dream car was a Seven Tre
Wanted a donk, I was still at the bus stop
That was around the time Trick Thugs R Us dropped
Three O five on a baseball cap
Used to peanut butter jelly with the baseball bat
Realest killers on the block still jookin' and stickin'
And everybody used to rock Reeboks with Dickies
And my aunties was getting loose to Uncle Luke
My uncle then was selling dope and smoking boonk

Picture me with my bamboo earrings with my girls at the block party on 15th (yeah)
Wrist full of bangles, me and my girls
Rockin' ocean waves and leisure curls, FILAs, K Swiss with the ruffle socks
Way back then before they knocked down scotts
Before the dope boys started riding on fours
It was trues and vogues, fifties and lows

Trick Daddy,"Back in the days
It wasn't no AIDS
It wasn't no AK's
More afros than braids
Wasn't nuttin for a boy to get a straight fade
But not no mo
Niggas done twist up the fro
Let it lock and grow
Quick to go to gunplay bout that flow
Nigga you don't know?

And I'm thinkin bout when
Round the time i was ten
And way before the pen
The worst thing i ever remember seeing
Was a boy get his whole head bashed in
But now they gettin blown off
Whole chest torn off
Whole block roped off
Two clips in his house for fuckin round
Runnin off at his damn mouth
Yep back in the days it wadn't bout fame
And it wudn't bout a name
Plus it wudn't no thang
To kill a nigga and do the rest of ya life in the chain gang
But na shit done changed
And I know it seem strange
But I'm a maintain
So I'm a stack my flow and say ""fuck you hoes""
Stay the fuck out the chain gang

Some hoes no shame
Other hoes play games
See they'll fuck ya for the fame
And when the heat is on and they can't hang
Theyll give them crackers yo name
Thell say it under oath
And swear to tell the truth
Run down what ya do
How ya clown wit ya crew
Along with that a list of shit like who fucked in who house
Tell a ho about ya spot
Where ya threw away the Glock
But every bitch that ya shot
Every key that ya caught
And every car that ya drop
The ninety-seven drop tops
And them Carolina trips
And then they grill you the flip
Time and date when ya dip
Every deal you done dealt
And every crib you done built
With no muthafuckin guilt
Back in tha days
It wudn't none a this
Ya couldn't pay a bitch to snitch
It just goes to show that
Fuck niggas and slimy hoes make the world flip the script

See back in the days
All pimps got paid
And all hoes got slayed
Alot a money got saved
And every playa had it made
In Dade
We was slayed before then
Boys was made before then
Way before them
Raisin poor men
With no choice
Way before them
But na shit done changed
I mean a nigga done came
Ya done took our name
We done peeped yall game
Ya ovalooked our pain
Man, and we ain't tryin to be friends
Ya wudn't tryin back then
Had a problem with my skin
Got together with ya clan
And send a young poor black man
Straight to the pen
Ya had beef with the blacks
But na the blacks got the gats
So if a cracker talk slick his ass gon get whacked
And you can bet that
See nigga
Back in the days
I was young and afraid
So dumb in a way
I was trapped in a maze

See,
See marijuana got me copin wit my problems
And hennessy got me hopin I could solve em

Tryin to scar me
But unlike my old sorry ass father I tried harder
My baby raised to hate her daddy
Her mammy playa hate and wishin that she had me
She hate to see me on tha street
And still on my feet
Betta yet this bitch wish them crackers had me
See everybody wantsa hustle
But dont nobody wanna suffer
Nobody wantsta die cuz they all bustas
And suckaz
Aint never gon have nothin
Cuz they be frontin
Gotta sacrifice
Three time for every dime they be wantin
And believe me
Being a thug it aint that easy
I once was a fool but see they had to free me
I'm undercover man
But still they aint respectin me
Tryin to get the best of me constantly stressin me

He introduced her to the finer things
Looked out started buyin her things
Minor things for the small change
And had her off the chain
And it's a awful thang
She aint even cost a thang
Even though I'm thugged out
She loved how
I did wrong for so long
And still got by
See thug money got blood on it
Plus it leave residue
Boy I'm tellin you
I put mo bread on it
I lost a homie in the stuggle right
And just the other night
Somebody tried to take my dogs life
Atempted homicide
They outside and aint gon let em ride
Dont wanna talk
And aint gon let em slide
They want war instead
They want more for dead
Rather die open fire or do life for their's
Take a life instead

Had to step and get my shit together
I left my homies in tha pen and reason being
See every man got his own sin

Living in a world where hearts are cold, yea yea ya'll
Living in a city where thugs don't live that long, so
Sleeping in a home where only gangsta's rome, all night long and ah
Thuggin there for days wit my g's and we pray, help us Lord

I done seen it all, done even lost a couple dogs
Everything from seeing hoes boosting in the mall
Niggas who used to ball, they ain't ballin' now
Hoes who hated me, dem bitches callin' now

And mama told me, but she never told me when,
She said when money come sin, its some fake ass friends
I keep niggas in da blind, and outta mind
'Cause broke niggas full of slim and they got dirt on they mind

Catch me slipping never, and not once, ever ever
Lost a bank to the better I'm a muthafucking fool my self
I can't fool myself, cause if I ever slip, they gotta have that there
Two years ago, I lost a friend in da line of thuggin'

He got drunk out clubbin'
Some niggas followed him home, a glock nine to the dome
It wasn't long for he was gone
For a set of d's and quarter ki's we lose to many men

And now to many man, understand how to be the man
See the man lied, so the man died, I seen the devils in his eyes
Though the man in the skys eyeing

Never confuse luv with lust
Retaliate bust for bust
You can trust in us, we spit that venomous
It's either, them or us, ash to ash, sell the dust

We go to war for the peace, ignore the police
I still believe that its the east that invented,
See the west complemented, they always represent it
And all my peoples down south keeps it weed scented

Better focus, when I put this hocus pocus on the cd
I drop mine in braile so them blind cats can read me
I'm the cat that curiosity killed, prophesy filled
I'm still water that run deeper than hole pussy

Get pushy in the clutch, roll up like dutchmadness
I cuts and slashs, plus I, flows like Casius
It's warless clashes you need credit in the last days
So when them gats spray, do crime pay when you get shot

That's why I stay calm like www dot, cd
For who seeks the actual article
You heard it live its certified, mechanic on the mother ship
The alien, I changed the course of them with the wings

I would love to be considered sin in a physical form
Like I'm born to be crucified and mother was born to cry
Taught bitches born to live long and bastards are born to die
And God and the devil just don't see eye to eye

'Cause y'all thugs don't understand that the devil gone always lie

Trick Daddy: 



Free me 

I've been captured by some demons 

They drainin my blood 

Taken samples of my semen 

Got the nerve to call me crazy 

Tappin all my telephones 

Questioning my lady's 

But I trained them every summer 

Hope to ball and never fumble 

Survive in the jungle 

It stinks like Stevie Wonder 

Rainy days, I'll be the thunder 

No carma and no drama 

So I gots to ask my mama 

Yo, why Kenny left me starvin 

Didn't daddy do his part?

She did all that she could do; She kept her faith in god

I rest around the roudy bout it g niggas 

And niggas who want to be known as thugs 

Livin the life because they want to boom in money and drugs 

But ain't no love when they spray 

Pray for them everyday 

Cause they kill ya dead and take ya bread if you play with they late 

To my dismay my niggas ain't no thugs 

They some slaves tryin to runaway to a better day 

And anything in they way, they gonna crush it 

But if ain't about that flow then don't discuss it 

Plopin and pumpin we off the chain and disgusted 

Willin to die for anything, and that's official 

Without or with you, pistol be government issued

See no like myself

Except for them demons that be by lookin like everyday people

See if I was a killa, y'all would hear my nine milli {WHAT} bang 

But na that never was my skillo, Funk Boogie mostly just be like chillen 

Dealin wit these crooked villains, standin ready like Freddie 

Tryin to whoop a nigga for somethin

Luv, oh, you really want it, girl?
Luv, I luv this shit, luv this bitch

She was a Betty, I done knew back in the day
Little scary lil' bitch from around the way
Plus she sucked and fucked all day
With a little bit of Alize, Alize, Alize

I put it down for these young hoes
Get the pussy like I'm married
And send her home with the cock swoll, did her pops know?
Little girl that he tryna protect was in the crib doin' porno

Fo' sho' baby, I know these hoes
Step up too 'em and show these hoes
I never wonder to myself, ""Would she?""
I get deep in her mind and her pussy

Who dat? She was the world's greatest dick sucker
Play the note with the tongue while finger fuck her
I hit it in the back of the donk, in the back of the Benz
Got my dick in her ass, front of one of her friends

Face down, ass up
Bitch be still while I bust this nut
I rock hard while I'm in these guts
Wipe my dick and then that's enough

She wanna kiss me after she lick me
Slap the drunk, you know the ho got Tinesi
Daz, this punk bitch wanna get with me
'cause the ho lookin' for a P I M P

You know the ho don't know no better
I would rough ride ya ass but the magnum's better
I know a lot of niggas done paid ya bitch
Remember one thing, I got a major bitch

Pull up on the stroll, in the fo' door Caddy
Slapped the bitch, she hollered, ?No, no daddy?
I got the cash, if she don't, that's her ass
So quick, so fast

I luv gettin' my head blown
I luv gettin' my nuts rubbed
I luv gettin' my dick licked
I luv gettin' my nuts sucked

I luv gettin' my pussy ate
I luv when niggas see me masturbate
I luv it when you nut all in my face
I luv it, baby but I can't stand the taste

I once knew a bitch named Erica
Way back in the day, she had a geri curl
I made her suck my dick on the ferris wheel
Been pimpin' all my life, big player for real

I said, ""Come on girl, you know how it's 'sposed to be""
It's makin' me nut but feel our fantasy
Come on, come on, baby, won't you get the best of me
I smell pussy

Get T double D on the double stack
And one dose of the dick, she be doublin' back
See me, I've been known to shit on hoes
Cuff her cold, straight spit on hoes

I been known to step on a bitch
Put a thumb in your ass, while I slap your clit
But ain't no way that I'ma lick yo' shit
Tell 'em what she is Short Dog, bitch

I luv gettin' my head blown
I luv gettin' my nuts rubbed
I luv gettin' my dick licked

Thug Money got blood on it
Plus a little residue
Boy, I'm telling you
I put my heart on it

I'm thinking back when I was younger
I usta hustle in the summer
No time for crime
I had to help my mama
And I love the rainy weather
Make me hustle better
Running into partner in na ghetto
Trying to get my shitt together
However, I'm giving these fuck niggas pillars
Robbing fake dope dealers and these fake ass killers
For my niggas
They keep they fingers on the triggers
Cause they heard about you business
And these fuck niggas trying to end this
So I'm ready, just riding dirty in the Chelli
Me and my cousin named Chopper and we stopping for that fetti
Call us foolish, cause of how we feel the way we do this
slanging, robbing, and shooting
Even neighborhood polluted
I'm ready to do this and like weed
I'm always louted with duck tape ya muted
If the shit move, I shoot it
Hold on

::Chorus::LyricsCafe.com::
I'm doing this one for my homies
Who left his baby mama lonely
Got chur-en dat neva saw him, got kids who don't even know him
Got to count his blessings sent
Cause one chance be his only lesson
For the homies all be missing, his son's got stronger missions
Hold on
Don't fall
Cause I've been there
And I know
Cause see all my niggas anit dope dealers
But they killers, for sure
They call us thugs, so give us our own section in the club
Allow us to use our drugs
Nigga what, nigga what
Say it

{Chorus4x}
I can't believe you haven't heard of a dog, pop, what a bird
And no clues on how the Feds got the inside word
He left his real homies home and all my thug niggas gone
And anit no telling when the boy getting back home
See everybody needs a hustle, so stay free from those bustos
Especially, when you getting in front of muscle
Cause them fools will try to touch ya
They know you dying for yours
So from day one, they don't trust ya
This whole style I be living for
Sometimes, look like I'm running fast speed
And this old bad luck taking me lower
Life's full of lies, there's too many guys
Who need to compete and God knowns a nigga tried
When it's gone get bettter, seems like never
In this life we live
Us niggas just can't stick together
However, I guess a change got to come from this
One day, but right now, I can't accomplish shitt
Patience for the frustration
Waiting to die for the troubles that I'm facing
So I'm living on the edge
I'm thugging til I'm dead, yeah
Standing free from them suckers and far away from them Feds
I say I never had no job, always rott
Living in the park, back when I was scared
And then things got better, my pockets got fatter
Went from to Jimbo, Timbo's, to Polo sweaters
Nigga came across a key and turned it into three
And got my fuck ass emenies running from me
And saying....

And a home cooked meal
Every single night
He'll feel with you
Goin' through
But I coulda warned you
When its time to be a man
Do all you can
See other lands
And don't be livin' for the other man
Take time out and settle in
Be the better man
And close watch your friends
And then
You'll understand
A lil' better then
But on the other hand
You so god damn stubborn
And you be
Startin' shit
And ever since you made president
We ain't even seen you since
You need to (you need to)
Fill our schools
Rebuild our church and homes
Stop killin' my own kind
And leave my Earth alone
And stop tappin' my phone
And searchin' my brone
And keep your personal feelings home
When you bandin' my chrome
Do it for the
Weak and the strong
And to each his own
We do it for the main goal
So when all the heat is gone

You use your platinum for ID's, then you's a nigga
If your skin is brown just like me, then you a nigga
Got a promotion and a FAT ass raise, you still a nigga
You from the islands and your peoples wasn't slaves, you a nigga

Hollywood nigga, y'all remember that motherfucking name

This bout that motherfucking money
Nigga!

To kill for cocaine and get a nigga killed
And a banana peel will get his whole hide flipped
He's bringin' danger to the life of his home boy's
You can see the moon, but don't let him go alone boy

Bout my money, we goin' to bump heads and it won't be long
That's why I got two choppers, one for the car, and one for the home
Got extra grip for when they hold on
Nextel, instead of these dial tones 

And quarter game for these old tapped ass cell phones
And new back bone for my new dread homes
You ain't been outta jail long, but nigga you dead wrong
Bout my money, nigga you shouldn't a played wit it
You're goin' to remember the day when this A.K hit ya.

Bout my money
That shit there ain't nothin' funny
Don't start duckin' and runnin' when it go to gunnin' bout my money

And it tells me all thugs niggas go to heaven
But between the lines of verses 48 and 9

But verse 100, talks bout my money
Say's its full of blood so all Memphis is funny
But nigga I don't want to hold your gold
I just want to free your soul 

And be found somewhere in public when all this shit unfolds
I done gave ya two bricks, and you ain't gave me back shit
You runnin' around in your new bubble lights

And you can keep your little watch and ring that go bling bling

Ain't goin' to get you young fuck nigga's nothin'
But a shit bag and bullet holes through your bloody clothes
Out of all the nigga's you motherfucking know

I'll meet ya at your front door, and I'm bringin' my calico
Nigga if you ain't got my flow you're ass gotta go
We'll get you mammy and all and layin' em down on the front room floor

Bout to do em all 'cause I done have problems bout all this shit unfolden
Bout my money, I came at it, and your son ain't have it
Now this nigga I owe is goin' to be the next nigga to go

Very sleek, gotta sneak, 
Peepin', creepin',

So for ever we should always be together. (shit)
Sweet love, slow tongue kissin', and hugs.
I'm on a mission, wishin', kissin' that belly button.
She hum a song, that got me on.
And it won't be long before I reach the zone.
Move along, how ever long.

Could it be I'm scared of the love.
Y'all want a turn to get so scandalous
This thug nigga just can't handle this.

But the I neva' met a girl that could role a philly like you
You could see I like you, when I kick my flow who feel it like you.
You was lookin' so sexy when you got out yo' white,
Checkin' out yo' thigh.
The dreams of a fine girl, I see out my eye,
She about yo' size.
Don't really seem like the type that'll really mutha' fuck with drama,
So nigga done just put up with a little trauma, so it's me she seem to hona'.
These other hoes don't get showed lately, me and her been hangin'.
Smokin', drankin', keepin' her shit tight, 
Swangin' all in a midnight bangin',
Never trippin', but I'm tippin', or just kickin' it with my dawgs.
We ball with them niggas tellin' me my nose been open,
Ever since I hit them drawls.
I tell them I'm still a pimp, 
I don't really want ya but I just pretend.

I figure you'se a ho but you can't help it
'Cause being raised by a ho is kinda hectic
Old material bitch 
Gold-digging for them tender dicks
A real nigga never give you shit Biotch
Born and raised in the motherfucking projects ho
Getting money by at the pak Jam, by the back door
Wearing them shorts up your ass with a tube top
Letting niggas stick they fingers all in the cock
Pussy all big and wet, looking good and shit
Smelling like dead fish
And every week it's the same shit you and that lil shit
And every time I see you, you got to have dick
You wants mo' respect
You gets no respect
And all you want is some hardcore sex
1, 2, 3, yes you know
4, 5, 6, 7 niggas in your hole
Back-to-back from the back, head and all
Doo-doo brown and licked his hairy ass balls
In the streets late-night me, you, and all my boys
What I'm thinking 'bout honey bun (honey bun)
You got the nigga running up in you
Shake it like ""Naww, I'm not trying to do you""
No good freak, is the same but I love you

Stupid bitch you done dropped out of high school 
But who's the fool?
You'se a prime example
You met a nigga named Mike 
at the nice Lexus lane looking like grands for the night
Times are hard, you scared, your rent is due
It ain't no limit to the shit you do
You making records in the studio
Telling me it ain't who you know it's who you blow
Sheit,
I'll hit you up for a gangbang
Have you doing strange thangs for some small change
Keeping it real
Fucking with the wrong pops
Longshoreman on the dock
Head, booty and cock
You get what he got
Shooting tech to his whole cat
Took him home let him hit you from the back
With tax because it's like that
I figure you'se a Ho Ho Ho
You can't trust
A bitch with a big butt
You get the guts, then tell that ho to keep in touch
Jimmy-up when I bust her
Fucked her

Protect the family jewels

Come here, something I want to tell you, what

Don't, don't I have a heavy Levi that a slide in dunk,

Where the weed at in the spot with the lump
I can't help but want to rub on them thighs and the hump
Shot her down in the zone, my love got 'cha high and it's on

You and me baby can get a little close and stop before your heat baby
Let me drop dem' draws and give you some of this weed baby
I really love the way you touch and suck on me baby
And the way you look when you run up in that three eighty

Nigga's bleeding in the streets
So I don't go, unless I'm chillin' on the low with my middle finger up
And I'm ridin' for Buddy Roe
Cause he jammed in it
My dog got slammed in it
I even lost Bam in it, wait a damn minute
This the street life, cracker think a nigga fadeless
Cause I'm tryin' to make it out the matrix, fuck this nigga
Nigga's life for dope and nigga's die for dope
And nigga's die cause they live on dope
And I remember when I told 'cha Roe
I would've shed blood for ya'
A nigga still got much love for ya'

Until the day a nigga lean back
This how a nigga show you real love
A dedication to them real thugs

But full of juice
Why wouldn't you?

Oh, Amerika, Amerika, Amerika
Sweet land of liberty, y'all

I'm doing this one for the struggle
And every bad doin' brotha, sista, daddy and mother
Who livin' in the gutter you want better cars
And a better heart, another start
Yo' own yard and a place to park

You want a truck and ride and a better life
A bigger crib and a home cooked meal
Every single night, he'll feel with you
Goin' through but I coulda warned you
When it's time to be a man, do all you can

See other lands and don't be livin' for the other man
Take time out and settle in, be the better man
And closely watch your friends
And then you'll understand a lil' better then
But on the other hand, you so God damn stubborn

And you be startin' shit
And ever since you made President we ain't even seen you since
You need to visit our schools
Rebuild our church and homes, stop killin' my own kind
And leave my Earth alone

And stop tappin' my phone and searchin' my bro
And keep your personal feelings home when you bendin' my chrome
Do it for the weak and the strong and to each his own
We do it for the main goal so when all the heat is gone

This game wasn't told to me, it was sold to me
And we are never free, no way
Not in Amerika, not Amerika
Our country 'tis of thee, land of liberty
But that'll never be, no way
Not in Amerika, not in Amerika

You only got 2 bucks and give less than a fuck, then you a nigga
Got a nice home and a Lexus truck, you a nigga
World champions and you M.V.P. you a nigga
4 degrees and a Ph.D, still a nigga

You use your platinum card, you need 4 ID's, then you's a nigga
If your skin is brown just like me, then you a nigga
Got a promotion and a fat ass raise, you still a nigga
You from the islands and your peoples wasn't slaves, you a nigga

No matter how much your ass get paid, you still a nigga
Shot by the cops at a traffic stop 'cause you a nigga
That's why I hold toast too, I sell bi coastal, international
They inter-catching you with satellites in deep space

Now who invented niggaz in the first place
And said America is the original birthplace
Who gettin' 10 20 life on they first case, my niggaz

This game wasn't told to me, it was sold to me
And we are never free, no way
Not in Amerika, not Amerika
Our country 'tis of thee, land of liberty
But that'll never be, no way
Not in Amerika, not in Amerika

I'm doin' this one for the kids in the streets who ain't missed a beat
Do it for the deaf and the blind and those who don't eat meat
Do it for all the children of the corn and the unborn
Do it for the speedy trials and all the lies you done sworn

How you gon' keep the man, old Mr. Crooked ass preachin' man
When your whole congregation drivin' a brand new Benz
And writing brand new sins, lyin' on a million men
And all my brothers, sisters, them daddys
And them doin' time in the Penn

This game wasn't told to me, it was sold to me

See, once that Hennessy into
Me the whole industry is my enemy,
If you ain't no ten to me or friend to me,
Bitch don't pretend to be,
I'm strictly for the thugs,
I'm part of the streets and straight out the hood,
That moments ghetto (ghetto),
Got me deep in gats for you wheezly cats,
I'm straight out the county of Dade,
Played on fire nigga M-I-A,
Never gone south of the border,
Americas most wanted you gonna get slaughtered.

With the big ole owl, dual heads roaring
Or is it the Caprice sittin' Emmitt Smiths, that's 22's
On the Impala on 20 inches
Mo' wood in it than old Abe Lincoln's cabin
And with mo' glass in it, than in your cabinets
Or is it the way we come down watchin' XXX
White sex from the ceilin', visors, and headrests
Or is it the chain, the gucci hat, the gucci Air Jordan retros to match
Even though I step on the scene, so fresh and so clean
Nice tek'n wit' me, I still got my weapon wit' me
Strapped wit' a tek in my jeans
Ready to squeeze, cause I know you haters get tempted to wear my
Neck a lace

No hustlas, thugstas, mobstas, and field niggas
On the treal, T double D, I still keep it real
I love the streets that you fuck niggas named Haterville
Lied on me, said I was a murderer, said I used to serve you work
But I ain't never heard of you
I love dub-deuces, only cause I'm sittin on em
And once again I'm gunnin, copped the big 500
A Chevy boy, candy green and chrome fronted
Niggas hide out or they ride out cause my shit runnin
I sold more oz's than cd's and lp's
Baby, I'm a thug plus I'm OG

Can we all just get along? smoke trees, hit a bong
Haters pussy niggas, so I'm a choke 'em wit' a thong
Even the block envy me, I make a mill wit' the flo'

All I ever wanted to do was be da man
Get out the ghetto and feed my whole fam
But the dirty streets in the city won't let me go (let me go, let me go)
All I ever wanted to do was be da man
Get out the ghetto and feed my whole fam
But quarter ki's make G's that's all I know (all I know, all I know)

[Trick Daddy]
A hit of crack frock could get ya fucked up
A ki of coke could get you rich
But too much of this shit can get you stuck up
That's why it's best to deal wit a nigga that you know and chill wit

Case he flip the script, you know where he live at
Plus, the game don' came a long way
Yeah we don' lost a lot of niggas that was speedin down the wrong way
See these days these niggas squeeze triggas quicker than yo boys

'Cause they got guns bigger than yours
Plus ain't not more coppin out
You either ridin or tellin, if you ride then you ride forever
Born the son of a straight killa

Raised by a strong woman, I'll ride for my homies
So, can a nigga get a boooonnnd
Or do another nigga have to come along and raise my daughter......son
Your Honor, answer this question and be honest
If you lock me up for the summer will you support my momma?

Hard ounces stashed in my cadillac dash
It's drought season daddy, we huntin for riches

We fly like birds go divin for fishes
A known deep boy, the number one Stunna
Got a hundred brick stash in the back of the Hummer
But on my block, a old tymer got shot

I didn't want to do it but he was holdin my spot
I'm shittin on niggas, grandma got grams
She gave me a revolver, automatics get jammed
I'm *Hood Rich* nigga one feet in the sand
I'm one of a few niggas that beat the man

A solid lil bitch with a whole lot of cream

Gotta keep my bread in a safe place
We up with my hitchens in undisclosed locations

Hey yo I got the llello, you got the money
Try nothin' funny and I don't buy dummies
Every ounce betta bounce back
And every brick that I break up

It all betta flake up
And when that shit hit the waters
Shit go to ballin'
That dope all betta fall in

I bought coke back on 84
Back when wood used to get them bricks from the Birdo
And when I hit him I want to hurt him
And on cutlass I want to hit it
They ass gon' feel it

[Chorus]

[Baby]
Ay, ay, ay, ay
It's the kid wit the bricks taped up in the grill
Mmmm Hmmmm Cadillac that is

You the number 1 stunna ma show a lil somthin'
Ay, ay roll a lil somethin'
Mmmm Hmmmm blow a lil somethin'
I got them thangs for a lil nothin'

If you got a lil money I'ma throw a lil somethin'
Bump this nigga
Mmmm Hmmmm fuck you nigga
We ain't from 'round here dumpin' on niggas

But ay Trick Daddy battle up for this nigga
Well let me get to my hustle (hustle)
I got bricks, grams, and bundles (bundles)
I got ki's in the muffler
Birdman daddy CMB motherfucker

[Chorus]

[Scarface]
Face mob, right back at ya
With O's like cookies I flip like spatulas
99.9 of the time I'm on the grind
Bricked up and breakin' em down

I got to admit the dope game gravy
3 zippers balled up you bring back 80
You learn to swell you might see double
Remember you can't sell bubble

So here it is fool
I play the game where its no rules
Givin' you lessons from the old school
You don't get high off your own supply

And when a motherfucker cross you make sure he die
Make the next man know he got to think about the payback
This shit go deeper than me rapping or me say that
Ask my nigga Trick Daddy, ask my nigga Baby
Been like that since the early 80's

Dade County's finest

[Intro]
Look what God done gave me
Look what God done done
And even though I'm thuggin'
God been good to me

On everything I love, I'm a thug
I done considered a change but what for (What for?)
Alla my homies in pen fields
I can't be lying to them, if I'm ridin' for them

I gotta tell 'em how it really is
A lot of things done changed since last year
Nope the crib and the same no more
And these young niggas don't respect the game no more

They don't see your name no more
They doin' they own lil' thangs though
Committin' sins, they know they get hanged for
But nigga God is straight, for as long as you keepin' it straight

Keep believin' in him and you'll be leavin' with him
So in Jesus' name I pray for better thangs
If you help me Lord my heart'll never change
And y'all pray wit me

Huh, huh-huh
'Fore they come get me and then come get cha

[Hook]
Look what God done gave me
Look what God done done
And even though I'm thuggin'
God been good to me, good to me
Look at all my money
Look at all I've done
And even though I'm thuggin'
God been good to me, good to me

I could've been Asian, Bohemian
Puerto rican, Jamaican
Could've been Cuban, Colombian or Haitian
Could've been Japanese, Chinese or Guyanese

Could've been from overseas or the West Indies
Could've been anything but God made me black
Could've had anything but God gave me stacks
While he was givin' me that he said remember you're black

Whatever you spend on your momma I be gettin' it back
So as you see, a new watch and a Benz
And I'm still gettin' money wit my same old friends
Know this lady named Miss Pearl, my old girl

Raised all us, based all us
So, I'm a thank the Lord for her
'Cause you know where I'd be if it wasn't for her
I done learned a lot of things in this game, matter fact

Seen a lot of other other things that was strange
And there's a new game out called snitchin'
And it's obviously helped because these niggas keep tellin'
Lord please help me smell my thugs

So I can keep this in life, but free my niggas tonight
And I'm a thug on in memory of Hollywood
Think thug for life, 'cause God's been good

That's the reason why shorty went in the hood and bought it
Mr. Rabbit like a fast from the past bone jean overalls why'all can kiss my ass
Thug nigga going back to the basic
And that Iceberg on the curve is thug animated
But first off this is T double
When I hitya with them k cutters
You turn bout three colors
Gon and get your big brother I don't care

Hold up 'cause Mr. Dollar got sold up

Keep your glocks up you can't stop us

Ain't no tellin' what a bitch will do
For the doe, She'll probably get on four and fuck the crew
Down south, Up north be the same ass bitches
Man locked up but mama watchin' the children
Talkin' bout my neck my back
Bitch you better learn how to chop rocks if you wanna get with Crack
Ughh, I been in love once, at least I though that
till I fucked around and hit a broad back
Got burnt, Now you figure the rest
Dick hurt like I'm pissin' baguettes, now I'm livin' depressed
Should have known better than to trust a hoe
Especially she wanna know how much doe you hold
Cause there ain't too many real bitches
If you got one hold on, don't wanna be nobody's meal ticket
And you know it don't mean shit to me
Cause you know, Bitches ain't shit to me
What

[Verse 2: Trick Daddy]
You see the problem is them busta ass niggas you been fuckin' with
Always bought ya shit, But never taught ya shit
Did he ever tell you some things that a player do
And made you aware that life is more than a hair dew
Boy I tell ya, Best to deal with them real niggas
And stay far away from fuck niggas
Don't be a sucker, Hell at least not from nothin'
All this suckin' and fuckin' a bitch better have somethin'
I need something that is compatible
Not nothin' young and dumb and full of cum, But one that's edible
I bet a, Nigga like T Double
Get it wetter, Suck and fuck 'em better than the average nigga
I need a girl that's into tryin' things
So I can put it in her mouth, Fa real ain't into mind games

Once we get together, I'll bet you she'll sleep better

You could set me up to crush time
It ain't selling the vines so nigga, lay down and do your time

I was sitting off in prison, and you ain't send me a penny

That we got wars going on
And it's way bigger than thugs, this shit's deeper than drugs
Suicide bombings, and air attacks
All the planes that were hijacked, and all of our politics
So I guess that makes me a democrat
The Republican party problems are worrying about crack
If I could speak another language, I'd say it in
French, Spanish damn it, so everybody understand it
Want everybody on the planet, that if you anti-thug
I guess you gets no love, from us

[Trick Daddy]
Where are the police at when you really need em
How can you chastise a child, if you ain't allowed to beat him
Want to screaming for no reason
Why you keep reproducing if you know you can't feed em
If he leave you, don't blame him
He the father of two mugs so regardless, you ought to raise em
And it might seem outrageous
This unsafe sex these days quite dangerous
And stop killing these babies, I mean it, I love em
If you don't want em give em to me I'll raise em
Truth is, that the future is our kids, and every playa with skills
Should be in the NFL, for real

And swig your jaw rap out we live it
Poppi gon' get it, seven digits
Seats in the six coupe made of lizards
And we won't stop like puffin' it
Whether it's crack or rap hustlin'
'cause we drop the hits that'll funk the hardest
Radio gon' play this regardless
S-N-S, bust like an SKS
Betta ask somebody who the best (Yes)

Call me - Rosco, Peeko Tran
And I come through in that seven tre thang (Uh-huh)
Play wit us, spray the damn thang
See down here that's an e'eryday thang
It's guns and greens on dub dukes
Cop deuces half price from the boosters
See thugs wasn't big enough
You wanted beef wit the thugs, but the club wasn't big enough
All the G's to the V.I.P.
Hoes follow along right after me
It's - SNS in this bitch
Matter fact, I be the best in this shit
Put me on your next remix
Now count the spins that you get (Uh-huh)
See shit get crazy dogg
I'm takin' this shit way back to the eighties y'all
We're packed in jumbo jets
Line it up, the boy bought to bring it back

Trick Daddy,"Thug holiday, go ahead you can cry this up right baby
Everything gone be gravy later, that's right
This the time when we take time to remember
All the loved ones we lost in the struggle you know
I dedicate this to my brother Hollywood, Toby, Bam
My dog Itchy and Lil Trav, I dedicate this to the struggle
Everybody in the county jail, state penn, check it out

Here go one for bad luck, hell against that a nigga wouldn't have none
But when I think about it, what would I be without my gun
How could I, get away from the po-po's, if a, nigga couldn't run
And how was I given a daughter when I always prayed for a son
Life is crazy ain't it, sometimes I even think the same thing
I've been waiting on freeing the ring hell but ain't a thang changed
And I lost my brother in the struggle, and then he lost his mother
And I'm thinking about it who's mine's who gone raise my brother
Not to be a thug, stay in school, don't use drugs
Who'll teach him right from wrong and show them boys, true love
So I pray for the better days, face the bomb had a run-a-ways
And, I put my guns away and I pray for peace on Sundays, it's crazy ain't it

[Chorus]
Just like the soldiers, that ain't coming home this year
Just like the fellas, in prison, we miss you so much for real
What about the children, who ran away, that ain't coming home today
Well here's a message from coast to coast
Cause when them thugs really need it the most a thug holiday

Just like em, just like em, just like em, a thug holiday - {2x}

Here go one for, all these killings and all these conflicts in religion
See the mothers, Jews and Christians but know they are all God's children
There's only, one him, plus ain't none of y'all confronting him
So blind in our own minds we wouldn't even know God if we confronted him
And, I read your books know all your remixes to the bottom
What about a, verse for the thugs curled with drugs and survival
That's asking chapels naming Martin, Malcolm and Faricon
In all my history books, only one died was the Americans
And, that's point of my, who's responsible for Vietnam
And, hold on there's more, we had two World Wars
And, how come the judges make more than the teachers is making
When they the ones raising all the taxes and got us fighting for education
Life is crazy ain't it

So many tears, through out the years
Somebody tell me what's going on
And so many liiives, but only God knows
About the pain deep inside
It gets so hard, you got to keep your head up
I know you're fed up, but stay strong
Here's a message from coast to coast
Cause when them thugs really need it the most, thug holiday

Just like em, just like em, just like em, a thug holiday 
Just like em, just like em, just like em, a thug holiday

This is for my people in the ghetto
I'm calling out, calling out
To all my thugs in the ghetto
Calling out, calling out
It gets hard sometimes, but you
Got to keep your head up, and be strong

Trick Daddy,"Ooh you feel that as I take you to them dirt roads deep in your southern roots 
When nobody said life was going to be easy 
And we travel to this emotional roller coaster called life 
And we have our ups and downs 

Just keep in mind 
When you hit rock bottom 
There ain't no where to go but up baby 
Just all you about how you deal wit it you feel me... listen here 

[Chorus]
When life seems hopeless 
It make a n**** lose focus 
Empty beer bottles and roaches, helps to get it off my chest cause 
I'm so stressed and all I here is ""f*** the world"" [Repeat: x2]

Man ever since life been a gamble 
My life been in shamble 
Double edge sword burnin' both sides of the candle 
""But Cris, you can't handle the truth"" 

Don't want to face reailty 
So lord accept my apology 
Please like when police say freeze 
And I ain't do s*** 

But I'm down on my knees 
Its a crooked system but gin straight take the pain away I charge the game 
And put my problems on layaway 
A black man but I feel so blue 

So I smoke green and purple til my dreams come true 
Then my eyes turn red 
Sky turns grey 
Children slangin' white in the hood 

We call it yeah drink old gold 
Down my yellow brick road 
Then rewrite my script til my story's untold 
See I got a little money and my life sped up now 
I'm fallin' and I can't get up

[Chorus: x2]

I had to dream about a dope fiend 
And its strange 'cause he can barely write or read 
But seems to get folks about anything curious about him 
I wanted to talk to him but he was to busy fo that 

But I was more then welcome to walk with him 
As we walked 
He talked and I just listen 
He said there's a big difference between crackas and n****s 

See he said white folks look out fo the white folks but uh black folks blang wit tha black folks 
When they ain't enough black roakz 
When you ooh to make a long story short 
We need pay more attention and do things that are more completes and he told me 

You know I wouldn't say something that wouldn't work and I wouldn't damn sure waste my time telling something that would hurt you 
But you would fall for anything 
If you don't stand for something 

But that's for certain but n****s don't be listen and that s*** be hurting 
No all of us but some of us 
And if we don't hurry up 
They going to bury each and every one of us 
 
[Chorus: x2]

Sometimes I can't deal wit my daily issues 
Just being sober lifes a b**** and I can't control her 
I wish I could and sometimes to cry on 
We need a shoulder 

The government stand us up 
To run us over 
And in the hood they don't seem to understand 
Goddamn!

What's really got me wondering 
Is if its a part of a bigger plan man 
I smell some thing fishy goin on and its way beyond blowin' away the smoke from these swishers 
Goin' on it ain't much I can do about it but preach the word of telling my people to spend ya money 

Wisely don't be obscured
By some things that depreciated like what like a home to open ya eyes to 
What's the f***s that's goings on 
'Cause the constantly getting rid of us one by one Whether Its drugs or diseases or gun by

Gun I ain't no saint either I feel that 
I'm even doing wrong by usin this chorus to get through this song

[Chorus: x2]

You know y'all going to mess around and complain about slavery that was over 40, 
50 years ago black folks need to move on
Y'all keep playin wit a crackerthey going to have yo a** tied up

Just one lifetime - wouldn't be long enough
for us to be together, at least not for us
And if I'm ever in a jam, be there for me
And keep it real with a player cause you care for me
With no strings attached, when you rub on my back
Greasin my strap, kissin my neck baby I'm lovin that
I got this thang that I do with my tongue
I want to do it to you, but it might make you cum
But it'll cure you of your back spasms
Have you floatin while your motion in your ocean gotcha backpedallin
And we can take it to another level
And get elevated, gettin way mo' creative
And you can slap me if it makes you happy
But if you scratch and bite me, that only shows me you like me
See, we can do big thangs
I make you scream my name and blame it all on the whip cream
And if you're down with me, I'll have you down and dirty

If I ain't a thug, you think I ain't a thug
Then tell me what I am

[Chorus w/ Trey Songz]
'Cause if I ain't a thug, why do I feel this way
Why the steets stay on my mind
Since I am a thug, why do why'all get so mad
Why can't cha'll accept that, it's my life

[Trick]
If I ain't a thug then why'all tell me who is
How many other mutha fuckas why'all know can do this
Yea I'm a thug fo ever and I never ever
Disrespect the game or cross one of my niggas (listen)

Slippin' already cost one of my niggas
So I better select the fools that I be chillin' wit
And I don't know nothin', didn't hear or see nothin'
I can't remember, but yet still I won't forget 'em

I'm from the dark side, born and raised in a thug life
And I'm out the city from the drug dealers and wise guys
If I ain't a thug, then you explain it 'cause
How come a young nigga livin' so dangerous

And why my name always somehow involved in stuff
It's obvious, why'all can't target us
Yea I'm a thug nigga, but I ain't a drug dealer
Three time convicted felone, so should I know better

You couldn't shake me up, now you tryin' to set me up
It's bad enough we had it rough when we was growin' up
You killed Pac and Biggie, now try to kill us
But I throw my Fos up, 'cause I'm foeva fo sho

I ain't the snitchin' kinda nigga
Yo, and I'm a different kinda nigga

So when I'm draggin' my Denim
Don't you bustas try and hit em (hear me)

Since I am a Thug, that's why you listen to me
'Cause I'm a T.H.U.G. officially, you see
A lot a niggas still doubt a nigga

But I expect them to, what else they supposed to do
When they dead broke and I got more flow then they do
And they mad 'cause I don't fuck wit them
Oh well stay mad 'cause I don't kiss niggas ass (bitches)

I'm too busy bein' a real nigga
So if you fuck wit me
You can fuck around and get killed nigga
The truth is Mr. Dollars is the real deal

Hell I'm the mutha fucker made county bail (yeah)
And I'm strictly for the Thug 'cause I'm showin off
And I'm quick to straight fuck a nigga (what)

Trick Daddy,"Children hold on, to your dreams
Believe in love, let love be the light
to show the way
And love will shine on you one day

Hold on, to your dreams at least
And believe in love
It'll show you the way, it'll show you the way
That's right, uh-huh

God bless the souls of those that impose a threat
Better yet, let's forget 'bout this foolishness
And though I never asked for forgiveness
If you want to pray to him, here's some things I might say to him
Lord thank you for my wife, my father and mom
And God thank you for my daughter and son
You know the devil he's been doin us wrong
And I love both of my kids, but they momma can't raise 'em alone
And yo, I just want a better understandin
There's got to be another way to handle it
And well we got to be mature about it
We both made our mistakes, and can't no one get us out it
My little girl's a little lady
And though she often act crazy, she still my baby
And I anticipate the day that I can see
the smile on her face when she speak to Little J

(America has a problem)

You see the problem with the world is
That there's way too many faces and way too many races
They done even managed to modernize slavery
They clonin little babies, these people goin crazy
And white America's on high alert
Black America's still starvin and livin in public housin
You still eatin off your food stamps
That's why one out of every three black boys end up in boot camp
And not to mention the ones we'll be missin
Let's face it, e'rybody can't make it
And e'rybody want to escape it (no way)
But if it's thug life we live, then thug life it is
But just remember, somethin gotta give
That's why, so many and die and, so little live
I can't explain it, but that's how it is
And God forbid, but it is what it is

Children hold on, to your dreams
Believe in love, let love be the light
to show the way
And love will shine on you one day

Hold on, to your dreams, and believe in 'em
Feel the strength, I know
He'll show you the way, he'll show you the way
He'll show you the way

The Lord have mercy on 'em
For they young and dumb, and that's why I come to pray for 'em
Though some of us are better than most of us
You can't involve the kids with our differences
And since memories are all we have
Don't you agree that all little kids deserve to laugh?
I'm, teachin the facts about our black leaders
Cause they be strong people, just keep readin, it gets deeper
We're all God's people
So regardless of color and race, we all is covered in grace
And you gotta be stronger than most
Therefore, we only supposed to go when we chosen
Cause God for the thugs too
Just be sincere at heart and dawg, God'll still love you
So to all my fallen soldiers, the struggle's over
All in the name of Jehovah

Children hold on, to your dreams
Believe in love, let love be the light
to show the way
And love will shine on you one day

Hold on, to your dreams, c'mon, why'know
Believe in love, and love be the light
I know, you know, that's right - he'll show you the way
I know, it'll shine on you, c'mon
And just pray with me, sing with me, c'mon
Sing with me, c'mon
Believe in love - he'll show you the way
I know you will - he'll show you the way, okay?

'Cause for every you check you slippin' they can call me Flipper
I only I missed a few niggaz (uh-huh)

Had to tell him mind me a nigga
I was like uh-huh, click click, see'mere, don't run nigga
All I want to know is
Where yo' connect, where the sack, where the money where the blow is
I heard Papi got them freighters
Now either he gon', give 'em to me, or a nigga gon' take 'em
The dope game's just too overrated
And to tell why'all the truth a lot of why'all ain't gon' make it
Done went from crack slingers to R&B singers
Before the mic's on, you was already singin
It's just a song was a big hit
He named me and his bitch on the remix [sing]

And to hell with bein' a man about it
Shit they got fo' niggaz and one gun, fuck bein' 21
Somebody better tell 'em

You see cause snitches get stitches
And there ain't that much of a difference between tellin' and snitchin'
And I ain't gon' keep on talkin' to you niggaz
I'm gon' walk right up to you niggaz and go off on you niggaz
And I ain't leavin' no witnesses
And don't get drunk and confess to none of why'all misses
See I know how to control my Hennessy
I speak no ingles, play crazy like them Dominicans
See cause poppa was a rolling stone
He said, son get your gun, it's a war and it's on
So why'all go on and bob your head to the song
Throw up the 4's for the niggaz, that's dead and gone

They makin' it hard for them {?} to smoke
I went to jail tryin' to get high; nigga told me
To go to hell went and called him, told him come get me out
So our father, who art in heaven
It must be the devil cause somethin' wrong with these niggaz
Nope - and crazy ain't the word
They say the stupid shit like Trick why don't you front a nigga a bird
Fo' what, so you can smoke it up?
Impress hoes, buy clothes, and make a nigga come fuck you up?
The game hard on a player
You coulda started with a block and now workin' just for quarter fare
With all the cards I sold the hoes left me all by myself
And the game don't even care!

He's good all the time

No matter how hard I cry
It just don't seem loud enough
Lord I hope you're hearing me
This goes out to the lonely streets
And all my brothers sick of crying y'all

[Verse 1]
I got a letter from my nigga in prison
He said he shooked them and its
Too far to drive don't even worry about a visit
All he needed was a couple pictures
And a few dollars
That way he ain't have to worry about borrying
From a nigga
Told me to check on his old girl
Make sure its all good
For her and the kids
But hell I already did
And then he asked me about his shorty
I hate he asked me about his shorty
Cause its been some years since I saw him
Him not knowing his baby's momma's horror
And ever since the days he's been gone
She's kinda trapped in a storm
But he goes on and on about when he gets home
And then he mention every nigga that did him wrong
Put him right back where he started at
But he ain't snitched
So he feels them that niggaz in his click
They ought to pay for that
He did his time day for day without turning snake
Cause real OG's don't even take pleas

[Chorus 2x]

[Verse 2]
See when I pray I pray for everybody
I pray that God bless America
That way these terrorist can't tear us up
But I'm sick and tired of a lot of other things
And the bottom line is
We gotta set examples for the kids
We first ought to teach em love
Cause these days us niggaz got
Too much hatred installed in us
The radio and TV they just can't get enough
This great big old world
I guess it still just ain't big enough
But y'all listen 'cause I'm holding on playa
The Lord ain't brought me that far
Just to drop me off here
y'all keep arguing about religions
While y'all referring to y'all old books of the bible
y'all all out to miss the last bus to heaven
See everybody gonna wait
ain't gonna do be no fighting, no pushing, no cussing
Nope not at the gate
Cause everybody gonna meet there
Niggaz you ain't even like in your first life
They gonna walk by you and speak
So

No matter no matter no matter
How hard I cry how hard I cry
Oh no matter how hard I cry
Ooh Yea

[Verse 3]
Even and 'Pac and Biggie become the best of buddies
Invest some money stay together in heaven
I know them niggaz gonna have so much gangsta shit to tell me
And its gonna feel so good seeing them together
So I'm sending my deepest condolences
To those who lost family members
To the hands of the men that befriend us
y'all remember we all in this together
But whosever ain't forgiving
y'all gonna have hell getting in heaven

(I-I ain't askin for much)
[T] Well go 'head then
I just want to sing, can I, sing you a song
I bet you'll love it (I ain't askin for much)

[Trick Daddy]
Listen; I just want to make music, I just want to verse or two
In fact, man, I want to be a rapper too
And I could probably sing the blues
Cause I got problems too, plus I growed up in the projects too
Well can you put me on your soundtrack?
Cause I got a good theme song that Betty Right could probably sing on
Yo, I just want a chance at stardom
I just want to be more than a thief or robbin
Well, what about a remix? And I could probably make the beat
and get it done all in less than a week
And make it clean for the radio, so the kids could watch the video
Yo, but y'all don't hear me doe
Man, I just want a crack at it
If I fail I'll be back, cause I refuse to be a crack addict
I want to prove the critics wrong
What started off with a poem done turned it into a song
Now I'ma sing it for you

[Chorus w/ minor variations]

[Trick Daddy]
Listen to me! I want to be a legend one day, that way
I can be put in the same category with Barry White and Marvin Gaye
And have a tribute dedicated to me
Sell platinum records and win Grammys so that the world can see
you could be anything that you want to be
Play sports or make music, just put your mind to it
And yo, I ain't the typical 'American Idol'
But when I'm done, I'm sure the boy Simon'll like me
Everybody can't act rap, and no matter how real the dream seem
e'rybody can't sing
But, there's another Michael Jordan or Tiger Woods
somewhere right in the hood, plus
Yo you ain't never seen a, meaner team
of tennis players than Venus and Serena
So, it's people like that that helped people like me
And they gave me the courage to sing, so I'ma sing it for ya

[Chorus w/ minor variations]

[Trick Daddy]
I want to do commercial and TV shows
I want to blow and sell records like the BeeGees sold
And I don't really need a chaffeur, I don't need a maid or a cook
Just a vacumn cleaner and coasters
And I can cook and clean for myself - with the right promo team
I feel, I can really do big things, and
I could probably write me a book
With all the stuff I got to tell 'em, it's got to be a best seller
And it's way deeper than a Coke and a smile
Why go to schools when the teachers ain't helpin us out?
My art teacher drive a Benz but he ain't bein artistic
I got music second period but the class won't listen
I want to sing

[Chorus w/ minor variations]

[Trick Daddy over Chorus as it repeats]
So, to all the kids
All the mothers and fathers, sisters and brothers of the world
why'know? Our kids need encouragement
We need a reason, why'knahmsayin?
Let's show 'em somethin, let's give 'em somethin to look forward to
So all you teachers that ain't doin your job, y'all step aside
Cause I got a little brother and sister that's gon'
grow up one day and be a teacher, and she gon' actually TEACH somethin
why'know? She gon' make it worth comin to school why'know?
It's deeper than free lunch now
I just want to sing
I used to be just like you

And uh, the rest is just a flick without a sex scene
Or lee, I speak the truth
'cause the blacker the berry
The sweeter the juice
'cause, Florida oranges and Georgia peaches
When they nice and ripe, they the best for eatin'

Laid her on her back, back
Turned her round, gave her bottom a smack, smack
She's a woman from the block with the best of weed
But I won't stop till I'm pullin out tracks, tracks
It was lust at first sight
And she couldn't help sayin that she wanted to get with me
And my size was just right
'cause she wanted a man with a little sec-you're-ity
Said I been around the world twice
And my name ring bells from Atlanta to Sic-i-ly
Said she wanted it all night

So delicious and so damn edible
All I need is some honey or syrup
With a lil' butter to rub down all your curves
And no need for the lemonade
Just a twist of lime and some grape cool-Aid
Can I call you Caramel?
'cause I'm bout to go coo-coo to taste your Coco Puffs
One bowl ought to fill me up
But that milk gotta be cold enough
So supper time that'll hold me up
I might choke myself if I don't slow it up, but
Honey, you look like a honeydew melon
Or strawberry with the whipped cream filling

And everybody gon' know about it
Yep, so put down your set, and shut up, and be sho' about it

But don't come home cryin unless your ass mind another one
And your ass better fight back
And you bet' not run and let it get back to mom
Cause, daddy ain't made no punks (uh-uh)
And, momma ain't raised no chumps (no way)

And slow up, hold that drinkin just a little bit
And when they want to get high, just let 'em hear this

That's why fuck niggaz and slap bitches never did like me

But Lord, if you're listenin', please God forgive me

Some of the shit I couldn't have, I wouldn'ta have
if the niggaz wouldn'ta took it
I wanted things my momma couldn't afford

And that's crazy, cause as a little shorty
it made me even want it more
But now the police got the spot hot
Doin' an undercover drug ring, sellin X pills and cocaine

And some sets up a reverse thang; what makes it worse
is that them jerks lost they spine against my own team
I heard how bad them boys really want me
But most likely, they gon' indict me, for keepin it real homey

After all, I done exposed a few of they rats
And done told on a few cats to get a few years up off they back
And all the shit that I can tell 'em, tell 'em
Two times convicted felon so, ain't much I can sell 'em

And tell his momma his son a whore
Him give dem crackers what dey lookin for
See the Boogie Man's got a backup plan

And I'll, back up sprayin, so why'all don't act up man
I was just a law-abidin citizen
And I never been a shit started, but I been well known to finish it
See, and you can fuck around, and have a whole truck

And all they need is a minute in the clear
Where all the witnesses in they ass done be worth a whole life chance
So why'all keep playin all the crackin, den throwin bricks at 'em

Do you swear to turn this chopper
On any motherfucker in your path, or the bitch that's trying to stop ya
Or do you promise to keep him handy
And don't hand him to nobody, nobody except family
And keep him cocked and loaded and don't expose him to no body
Unless somebody, who want him in his body
To love and cherish and from this trigger to a barrel
From the bottom of your heart
'til death do you fuckin' part
Do you understand to live, to lie by him
Is to share your soul, Lord knows, you gone die by him
I know you heard gun stories about John Wayne and Billy the Kid
Shit, all them motherfuckers dead
And did you know that every other bitch from the Wild, Wild West
End up dying from hollow points to they fuckin' chest
Cause I ain't never seen a cock beamer meant for a team of tummy guns
With a hundred round fuckin' drum

Yet I'm feeling good and spiritual
Healing hoods with this shit up out my kitchen

You leave your green around me

You leave your drink around me
Believe your drink gonna get drunk up
You leave your girl around me
And she bad she gonna get stuffed
These niggas is spies we living it live keep them nice tires

Car pull out the phantom
Niggas can't stand it but them hoes gon' come out
Just really wanna smoke my weed
Fuck these hoes and stack my cheese

Stop at the light and pause on 3
Hit the mall and it be all on me
But gotta keep one eye out for the po-po
Close the window when I roll the indo
Know they mad 'cause I roll the Benzo
It's that purple not pretend-o
Three 6 Mafia and they my kin folks
So when I'm in Memphis, Ten-a-key

'Cause them niggas still let me smoke for free

What's up Mary (How you doin'?)

Since I have met you girl you ruined my brain (Ruined my brain)

Yo girlfriend wanna ride with me
In the car wit a pimp where she supposed ta be
You ain't met no dudes spittin' cold as me
With a bag of kush that cost six-fifty
Have a nigga who smoke Reggie Miller
Coughin' and choking constantly
Tastes like fruit when you hit it
Gotta have bread to get it
Smoke all night, sleep all day
That should be the American way
Roll that shit, light that shit, 
Hit that shit, hold that shit, 
Blow that shit out slow
Then pass it to me bro

MJ gonna sprinkle in some of that 
Super incredible, leave a nigga runnin' back
Where the nigga really good sticky number at
Cuttin' through the cigarillo like a lumberjack
In the morning what I need is to breath again a whole lot of weed
But maybe somebody can give me what I need when I want no less than the best of the trees
DJ Paul and Juicy J, 8-ball and M-J-G
And Young Buck we don't give a fuck

And we be like Bill Clinton girl take it out ya mouth

Trick Daddy,"[Verse 1 - Young Jeezy]
Welcome to the life of a young thug nigga (yea)
Only hang out wit' them criminals and drug dealers (ayyy)
I'm from even where dead die (die)
But try an' do it big like the kid from Bedstuy
I see death around the corna and I ain't scared
I got a carbon 15 and I'm fully prepared (that's right)
Lord a mercy 20 rounds in a clip (yea)
Outta line get 20 rounds in ya hip (ayyy)
Shoot first and ask questions lata' (lata)
The answer is it was all about the paper (yea)
Everything the game is shit to lose
And a new forty-five that I'm dyin' to use (yeahhhh)

[Chorus - Ill Will]
If ya real like me (like me)
Throw ya hoods in the air so the whole wide world can see (ay)
Last of a dying breed, last of a dying breed, last of a dying breed
And if ya real like me (like me)
Keep that thang on ya hip that's just the way that it's gotta be
Last of a dying breed, last of a dying breed, last of a dying breed

[Verse 2 - Young Buck]
I done seen niggaz come and go
Shit the whole world done seen what I done before
We do anythang when the funds is low
I'm the reason outta towners don't come no mo'
Let me show you niggaz how to break down the whole thang
My nigga B.G. know Buck been a birdman
It's got to be in ya blood to be a thug
If I ain't makin' enough I'ma jack my plug
We was born in it
Not sworn in it
You can go against it or you can join wit' it
Made my mark so the streets gon' remember me
Now come and get it nigga Cashville Tennekee holla back

[Chorus]

[Verse 3 - Trick Daddy]
Some of the dudes we thought was real O.G.'s was O.B's
Cause they talked pleas and included G's like you and me
The first step was going to set a trap
So in a short period, they convinced the grand jury to allow a phone tap
And if they listenin'
Not once did they hear us mentioning
Murder and a cocaine distributing
Through all that was dividends comin' in
I'm strict legit, and better yet we too smart for ya bullshit
Callin all cars (callin all cars)
Hit your brother along
And tell 'em hurry up and come them niggaz got gunz
Man down, shots fired, only fuck niggaz and cops died
First stage of a riot
And them fucks couldn't sneak by
Oh you want to witness some shit
Fine bitch, be quiet
Because they only got what you tell 'em
And only witness that they had, the bitch was layin' there dead
Shot in the street all red, with two shots to his head
Cause he was workin for the feds
And the last informant, informed us
They had it out for us
For a bird that he got popped for
So ride or die for him (ride or die for him)
Better yet, you better kill 'em
Cause I think he's gonna be the bitch to tell 'em
And he probably done all ready told 'em
But then again with out a witness them bitches ain't got shit

So we went our separate ways,
It's been a couple of days,
But now I'm doin' what I want to 
With nobody tellin' me what I'm gonna do 
And I'm feeling so free,
With nobody but me,
Now I can handle all my business 
All my fellas can I get a witness 
But I'm feelin' kinda lonely 
On top of that I'm kinda horny 
And I gotta get back to her,
Now I'm leavin' quickly,
Before she come and try to get me,
And I'm takin' everything with me,
Well it all come down to her",I'm Sprung 2,2005

So he's gonna be

His mama was a G
And daddy was a G
But nothin' left for him to be

This is a story bout a young nigga
Who's mama was a whore and his daddy was a drug dealer
Ridin' 'round the corner from 'em was the spot
They sold weed, lace, base, heroin and marijuana

His role model was an older nigga
Who kept a wad of hundreds 'cause he had a whole lot of money
Now keep in mind this is 'round the time that
Miami niggas was really tryin' to put it down

That's back when the pimp game played out
That next year crack cocaine came out
And it all started in the suburbs
But only rich folks could afford to go and smoke that good dope

And yo they used to call it free-base
But when it made it to my block, me and my boys called it Crack Rock
We used to cook it up and bag it up and sell 'em
Nickels and dimes to any bitch that was buyin'

Mama was a G
Daddy was a G
Nothin' left for him to be
But a thug

And when he first hit middle school
He was a typical, ordinary, everyday ass dude
Around the time eighth grade came around
He had done made up his mind, a nigga can't lay down now

His first job, he was a watch out
He had to scream one time every time the cops hit the block
We used to call him Bo Brown
'Cause when he came around, close shop nigga, shut it down

Them lil' two-hundreds
That was a lot of money for a young nigga sittin' 'round not doin' nothin'
Plus his mama had a newborn from an old nigga out the hood
Who don't do shit for him

They go another bill, another mouth to feed
Oh well, yo a nigga couldn't stop there
He gotta keep food in his crib and keep the lights on
Ain't like his daddy's comin' back home

Now just imagine the role of a thirteen year old
Who playin' head of his household, now that shit's cold
But then again I suppose
You already know how the shit go

Mama was a G
Daddy was a G
Nothin' left for him to be
But a thug

He advanced from watch out man to lieutenant
And now he got two feet waist deep in it
And he control the whole operation
But it's kinda different 'cause he's dealin' with some stiff competition

And everybody wants to be buddies
All of a sudden friends but then again all they see is money
And he ain't never too flashy wit it
Not into cars and jewels, just nice clothes and new shoes

Half of the money went straight to his mama
But the other half, you know, the kid had to keep it stashed
But it's kinda hard to hide drug money
But it's worse bein' a dope but none of this shit's worth dying for

But when it comes to livin', money's nothin'
Bein' dead is free now tell me, what would you rather be?
Don't tell me, tell it to your child
Make your talk worthwhile and the rest, he'll figure it out

Steady grillin in my donk/

Im just trying to put my mack down/
And Im just flossin in my heavy chevy/

I feel like an old Seven tray impala/
Wit no doors and no windows/
Wit no oil/no g*d dam**d water/
Been riding around for over 200, 000 miles/
With no tags/no insurance/
On some old bald head a** tires/
My alignment off/timing off/
S**t lookin real bad/
Cuz Im down to my last quarter tank of gas/
Good thing the weathers in fair condition/
Cuz where Im from/
All year long n****s need air condition/
But I aint got none cuz my compressor gone/
And I keep hearing a tick tick tick ticker sound/
I think one of my heads is blown/
They say for 1500 I can get it rebuilt/
But I aint got a dime/
Im going through some hard times/
I aint lyin/
(Chorus)
(Verse 2)
You know s**t get rough/
Every year around the same time/
The longer you wait/the longer its gonna take for you to calm it down/
And its gon take more than a check for X to pimp my ride/
Ima need me a new blockbuster deal/
For a n***a to live/
Its gon take shady 4, 5 maybe 6 mil/
I done did 6 albums n***a/

And now you trippin/
Cuz my transmission aint slippin/
I aint getting no younger/

And broke down on the side of the road/
Steering column been broke up/
But never been sold/
So this time Ima need me some insurance/
I need me some medical/and dental/and some gangsta a** instrumentals/
So I can get this s**t all chromed out/

The wettest s**t a n***a ever seen/

And I must be a motherf****n pearl shine/

Aint nothing like and ol full tank of gas/
Aint nothing like being waxed and washed/
Then being valet parked/
And I got rid of that old bad cough/
Got me a new cam and exhaust/

And thats without the spray/
Get out my way/
Get out your car/

Is a motherf****n superstar/
The American Idol of the Chevy game/

The first off I beat the breaks off her
No sense in half-steppin'
Get serious
Get the titties suckin' like
Clit rubbin' and ass grabbin'

Should make the pussy cum

All the matter is
I can get you wet again
Suck you fuck you better than
Any other nigga can
I specialize in multi orgasms
Gettin' rid of back spasms
And do it all without Viagra
I'll fuck you all night
Make you sleep all day
Treat you to breakfast then
Eat you for breakfast
I know baby
I'm so unselfish
But you're lovin' it besides
I'm a freak so I can't help it
All I need is old slow songs
One cold shot of patron
See you walkin' around me in a thong
And it'll be over before the chorus come back on
You'll be leaving and I'll be ab libin'
And we'll be singin' our damn song
It's like the first time we made each other cum
We'll be suckin' and fuck each other
Taste each other cum
No soul alive can erase what we done
All our horny sticky memories you are stuck to me permanently

My shit is platinum
These assholes wearin' white gold
See, I'm too smart for this 'cause
All my shit paid for
And why should I rent a house
When I can buy it and write it off?
Make it my Florida home for the summer
'Round winter time just rent it out
See, I ain't none of them
Who ride around on rented rims
Change on the weekend
And floss in him mama's Benz
See, when I hit the scene
I be so fresh, so clean
White fitted, white tee
Ain't no nigga like me
What kind of shit you on?
Wearin' fuckin' rhinestones
Them cubic zirconium, son
Them ain't fuckin' diamonds
So you gonna fuck around
And get gangrene at the arm
Who'd rob and kill one
Over some motherfuckin' slum?
Your chain is crazy

They asked the kid the difference between mine and his
See, my shit blindin'

And he had his 'Roley' on
But I ain't even notice his arm
But his diamonds cloudy
And he ain't shiny
And I heard his shit Tick, tick, tickin'
Oh man, this nigga trippin!
See, we poppin' bottles and smokin' bugga
Actin' cocky
Big thangs with fat pockets
Wearing seventy-thousand dollar watches
My overseas friends
Are breakin' thangs in
Invest in a smaller hit town
Shakin', bakin', and breakin' it down
We gettin' top dollar
'Cause we got that top powder
Hos slob on our Johnson
'Cause Johnson got that best powder
We call a grand a dollar
We gettin' money, holla

I'm on the right path at this rate
I'll be sellin' slabs by the halfs

I'm still here waitin' cause you still my nigga.

Hold up, ay, 
I just sent another kite, to my people that's locked, 
They say he had another fight (again),
They say he got 30 days in the hole for beatin 
A niggas ass for tryin' him like a hoe (that's my nigga),
Treetum gone, all over coke, hit him with conspiracy cause he was on the boat, 
They say he'll do 15 at the most,
We prayin for an appeal, but it is what it is,

And anybody else behind bars cause they hustle.

I'm doin this one for the thugs, 
And them niggas on the corner every morning gettin' money,
Yes sir, and those who died by the gun, 
And now they dead and gone, 
I'm doin' this one for the deaf, the crippled, and blind,
For those who went strong, and they lost they mind, 
I'm doin this one for the low income, the slaws,
The homies, the basers, and bongs,
For the good, they got to suffer with the bad, 
And for the mother of the child with the dead beat dad,
For my lil brother who was just in the crash, 
Now he can't feel his arms or his legs, man,
I'm doin this one for the tears that were shed, 
For all the niggas that was sentenced to the state or the feds,
To all the does who was givin' they bows 
After talkin' to the door while they homeboys told

Listen bra I know you waitin' on that day to jump, 
But keep ya head up boy because its soon to come,
Cause you know the streets miss you they ask about you errday, 
So you gotta maintain,
Get up out this okay, though I know you hot 
Cause your homeboys shittin' on ya, fuck them niggas tho,

Only real niggas gon keep it treal with you, 
And you know I'm blood, what you need I'm a get you,

Bein' caged in the pen ain't for a real nigga,

You see I do it for the hustle, 
And the niggas who stood over pots and watched that shit bubble,
And them niggas stood on the block and watched that money double, 
And the ones who stood up to cops and ain't said nothin',
Look, ain't that many alive, but I know plenty ridin, 
My lil' brother locked up, doin 25,
And when I get some change ima try and change that, 
And just to think about the niggas I can't bring back,
And can we please have a moment of silence, 
For all the niggas that's no longer around us,
For all the niggas that pro-longed in the county 
And metro-s and T-G-K and star-k, nigga we block raised,
Cops couldnt stop pay, we got rocks so we open up shop today, 
Times is hard, plus life is a motherfucker,

Seen niggaz steal and done seen niggaz kill
And them same niggaz there, them be the main ones that tell
There's a lotta tension in the air, so nigga easy on them pills

I rather be the bitch that's squeezing than the nigga that's bleeding
See I'ma drink my liquor and I'ma smoke my weed
And I'ma stay far away from y'all buster motherfuckers
Y'all sucker motherfuckers, man fuck you motherfuckers

I'm being convicted of a thug living and drug dealing
Been a two time convicted felon ever since I was a lil' nigga
My first words was curse words
Shit, the first bid I did I was just a lil' kid

And I was raised by pimp, hoes and mobsters
Taught the game by dope boys and robbers
I ran the streets with goons, I broke the rules with fools
I used to take my motherfucking tool to school

See I been thuggin' all my life, trying to live right
You ain't even gotta ask
I got that Hen in my cup, smoke in my lungs
What you know about that

You already know straight up, you already know straight up

You already know straight up, straight up, straight up

These feds crazy trying to take me down and book me
Throw me on death row and do me like Big Tookie
Got me running from them rookies and poppin' at the seargent
Tried to tell 'em not to push me now look what you done started

And you got these rap artists that's beefing on these songs
But I really will kill so I'm leaving that alone
I'm a grown ass man that ain't about playing
Ten G's will get you killed, your family will die for twenty grand

Blow my nose with a Gucci rag smoking on a Cuban
You damn right I know they mad, 'cause half of em' losing
I slip a another clip into my A.K.
Stay with Trick in M.I.A. when I come and get the yae

See the Chevy got a stash spot, I can fit a hundred
In the back and just mash out hope I make it home
If they catch me then I'm gone so we put it on the line
Everyday we on the grind gotta hustle 'til you shine

See I been thuggin' all my life, trying to live right
You ain't even gotta ask
I got that Hen in my cup, smoke in my lungs
What you know about that

You already know straight up, you already know straight up
You already know straight up
You already know straight up, straight up, straight up

My blood line is a level above the thug line
And according to the cat scan I ain't a ordinary man
See I, I run off oil and I breathe off chronic
I power up off money like a motherfucking bionic

I travel through time with a military mind
Strapped with a Russian A.K. and a German made nine
And don't be mad at the [Incomprehensible]
They ain't the one who trying to attack us
It's slimy ass niggaz and red neck ass crackers

y'all better lower your weapons before my niggaz get to steppin'
'cause shit can get real crazy if it was a thug invasion
Imagine a whole bunch of Cuban niggaz and Haitians
Rebellion on your ass for the shit you did to us in the past

See y'all those things and even arrested fiends
It took you fifteen years to close the ave
It's going to be twenty more before they close the [Incomprehensible]

Now where my D Boy big gun toters at

At the end of the day he comin' home and it won't be long
He survived the heart attack but then he fucked around
And died of a punctured lung

Now bury his punk ass wit a wig, bra and his pumps on
And lay him on his stomach wit his ass in the air wit a fuckin' thong on

We high

Good evening ladies and gentleman
This is you're captain speakin' to ya
I'd like to welcome all of you aboard my flight
A flight that's promised to take you high
Way high up in the sky
So get out'cha blunts
Ya Dutchmasters and ya Backwoods
And I'll turn ya seatbelt signs off

I only smoke the best bud
Jamaica and Bahamas got the best herb, yes sir
I could smoke, toke after toke
Won't give a triple choke
And it won't hurt my throat, nope!
Chinky eyed, just ridin' n vibin'
On that real fire
Be high for two-three hours
And I'm cool wit' A-I, but hey
I ain't too much into Phillie's
But split a Dutch and I'll re-fill it
And I ain't friendly, so nope, ya can't hit it
I smoke good trees
Yo collard-greens full of reefer seeds
You use too many chemicals
Too much added stuff, fool, it ain't real kush!
One joint of that G-14
Will have you higher than your highest dreams, just floa-ting
Not knowin' if you're comin' or goin'
But when it's partly-cloudy, be prepared for the storm
And get high

[Chorus]
Roll up and feel the vibe
Lay back, enjoy the ride
Inhale, deep inside
Exhale, we so high
Roll up and feel the vibe
Lay back, enjoy the ride
Inhale, deep inside
Exhale, we so high (High)

Love your stewardess coming through
With snacks and drinks
Everybody got cotton-mouth, or the munchies
So y'all keep smokin' that good-good
Help ya fly along, high
High in the sky

Roll a Cigarillo, fire it up n' hit it
Feels so good man, it's hard for me to quit it
M-I-A, land of the palm trees
T double D came through with the bomb trees
And when a nigga inhale this
I had to put my shades on, get behind tint
In the clouds, lookin' down on the ground
Eightball, big black playa from the mound
Remember when, I used to have them dime-sacks
Lil ma circle by my house wit' the weed trap
Now my Zip-Lock's be full of bubble-kush
Spark it like a broads bush when she's on douche
Fruit cocktail, you could tell, by the smell
Burn one, let the whole club know I'm here (Hey!)
Let's fly tonight
Come ride wit'cha boy and get high tonight

(Feel the vibe)
Ain't nothin' like bein' able to smoke-smoke good-good
(Enjoy the ride)
(Deep inside)
And be way up here in the air
(We so high)
Away from all the troubles
(Feel the vibe)
And problems that's goin' on down there in the real world
(Enjoy the ride)
Oh, it feel good, don't it?
(Deep inside)
(We so high)

Roll up and feel the vibe
Lay back, enjoy the ride
Inhale, deep inside
Exhale, we so high
Inhale, deep inside
Exhale, we so high (Up in the Himalayas)
Roll up and feel the vibe (Gettin' money, we out)
Lay back, enjoy the ride (Smoke on, smoke on)

The only people I know, who don't smoke
Is Jesus, see-O, and my last P-O
Yo, but I ain't on papers no mo'
Ain't gotta creep and sneak
At least not to blow (Not to blow)
I spent my first two years gettin' high
By smokin' dollar joints rolled outta 1.5's
That was 'round '84, '85
Smoke all week for the dimes
Now nigga that's live (Nigga that's live)
Visine to help clear my eyes (My eyes)
Sprayed cologne on, when it was time for me to go home
I been doin' this for twenty years (Twenty years)
Ain't never seen or heard of one man that weed done killed
So just chill (Just chill, take puff here, puff there)
Take a puff here, there
To bring ya down a lil' off ya pills
After that, go and eat'cha a meal
But'chu gon' have to bathe ya ass to get the smell out'cha hair, yeah

Roll up and feel the vibe
Lay back, enjoy the ride
Inhale, deep inside (Inside)
Exhale, we so high (We so high)
Roll up and feel the vibe (Feel the vibe)
Lay back, enjoy the ride (Enjoy the ride)
Inhale, deep inside
Exhale, we so high

Sad enough, yours truly
The booger-man himself
Bout to take you all across the world
Take ya everywhere wit' the electric chair
Goin' let'cha see anything wit' the wind
But then again
You'll never get high like this again
Come again my friends!

[Trick Daddy:] 
Our father who art in heaven 
Hallowed thy be thy name, thy kingdom come 
All our G's would've been gone (would've been done) 
If it wouldn't for thug holiday (ahh man) 

[Verse 1: Trick] 
In this life I live, I done see niggaz deal 
Seen niggaz steal and done seen niggaz kill 
And them same niggaz there, them be the main ones that tell 
There's a lotta tension in the air, so nigga easy on them pills 
I rather be the bitch that's squeezing than the nigga that's bleeding 
See I'ma drink my liquor and I'ma smoke my weed 
And I'ma stay far away from y'all buster motherfuckers 
Y'all sucker motherfuckers, man fuck you motherfuckers 
I'm being convicted of a thug living and drug dealing 
Been a two time convicted felon ever since I was a lil' nigga 
My first words was curse words, shit, the first bid I did I was just a lil' kid 
And I was raised by pimps, hoes and mobsters 
Taught the game by dope boys and robbers 
I ran the steets with goons, I broke the rules with fools 
I used to take my motherfucking tool to school 

[Chorus: Trick] 
See I been thuggin all my life, trying to live right, you ain't even got ask 
I got that Hen in my cup, smoke in my lungs, what you know about that 
You already know (straight up), You already know (straight up) 
You already know (straight up), You already know (straight up) 
You alread know (straight up), Straight up (straight up) 

[Verse 2: Buck] 
These feds crazy trying to take me down and book me 
Throw me on death row and do me like Big Tookie 
Got me running from them rookies and poppin at the seargent 
Tried to tell not to push me now look what you done started 
And you got these rap artists thats beefing on these songs 
But I really will kill so I'm leaving that alone 
I'm a grown ass man that ain't about playing 
Ten G's will get you killed, family will die for twenty grand 
Blow my nose with a Gucci rag smoking on a cuban 
You damn right I know they mad, cuz half of em' losing 
I slip a another clip into my A.K. 
Stay with Trick in M.I.A. when I come and get the yae 
See the Chevy got a stash spot 
I can fit a hundred in the back and just mash out 
Hope I make it home, it they catch me then I'm gone 
So we put it on the line 
Everyday we on the grind gotta hustle til' you shine 

[Chorus] 

[Verse 3: Trick] 
My blood line is a level above the thug line 
And according to the cat scan I ain't a ordinary man 
See I run off oil and I breathe off chronic 
I power up off money like a motherfucking bionic 
I travel through time with a military mind 
Strapped with a Russian A.K. and a German made nine 
And don't mad at the [?] they ain't the one trying to attack us 
It's slimy ass niggaz and red neck ass crackers 
Y'all better lower your weapons (lower your weapons) 
Before my niggaz get to steppin 
Cuz shit can get real crazy if it was a thug invasion 
Imagine a whole bunch of Cuban niggaz and Haitians 
Rebellion on your ass 
For the shit you did to us in the past 
See y'all [?] and even arrested fiends 
It took you fifteen years to close the ave 
It's going to be twenty more before they close the ? 
Now where my motherfucking twenty one soldiers at 
Now where my D Boy big gun toters at

Trick Daddy,"Drop that beat, 
Its the truth.
You don't know what you have until you lose it.

I've had all the women you could possibly imagine, in my life.
I've had all the cars, all the cribs, all the money, in my life.
I've had my ups, my downs,I paid my dues.
Learn my stride?
Love for the passion......?

All I know is the hustle and grind.
All you want is some quality time.
I can't give it to you due to the life that I choose.
My heart is so close to the point my blood had froze.
I might wear diamonds if they really could freeze time.
But then again time is money and I need mine.
There I go again being selfish, 
And there you go again the love and helpless.
You mean the world to me baby you know its the truth.
But I don't know who I love more you or the booth.
These are just the things I need to get off my chest.
Sometimes I feel like all I can give you is sex.
I'm sorry

I've had all the women you could possibly imagine, in my life.
I've had all the cars, all the cribs, all the money, in my life.
I've had my ups, my downs,I paid my dues.
Learned my stripes.
Love........?

I ain't gone lie, baby this life is addicting.
The fame, the money, ecspecially these bitches.
I've been around it all, I've seen them ball.
Seen them fall, go broke and lose it all.
That's why I work hard, 365.
24-7, baby that's my life.
I bleed, I feed, I sleep,I shit this.
I got a bad stomach with these haters on my shit list.
I know its hard to understand, 
But its outta my hands, 
This is God's plan.
I came, I saw, I conquered.
I apoligise, but this game is a monster.


I've had all the women you could possibly imagine, in my life.
I've had all the cars, all the cribs, all the money, in my life.

Six months five years for you just to cop out
Ninth or tenth grade is usually when niggas drop out
Fights break out when you wired and start joking
A lot of OG's retired and started smokin'

You ain't the first fool its cool with us
But why you living out your idols dreams
Remember how for you came and help you keep those thangs
Now its cool that your address changed
But I'm tryna holla at my dog and the number ain't the same
I guess new homies came with his fame
But see true homies will stay the same
Through all the up's and down's in your career

And when you dead or broke without a deal
All the groupies cleared
The ghetto will still be here

And you represent the horde two hands in the sky

I'm so hood (listen)
I wear my pants below my waist
And I never dance when I'm in this place
Cause you and your man is planning to hate (I'm so hood)
And I got these golds up in my mouth 
If you get closed into my house 
Then you know what I'm taking bout I'm out the hood
And if you feel me put your hands up (hood) 
My hood of niggas can you stand up (I'm so hood)
If you not from here you can walk it out 
And you not hood then you don't know what I'm talking bout

Everybody wanna mother fuckin' know why I dress so fly sit so high (bitch)
I do it for the hood
Bitch ass niggas I do it cause I could
Every star on my jeans four X on my white tee
Living life like a g that's why these bitch ass niggas wanna fight me
Black ain't going play wit em'
Nu uh brother left to ak hit em'
Tough niggas get fucked up
And put on ice for the rest of they life
I'm straight out the hood bra
See that's what I do it for
My low class ghetto ass
Just renewed my ghetto ass

[Chorus]

Ross yeah four five off in the ride
For plus for me to get high

Dropping for you last

For money for mayhem for yayo and millions

What I owe you sumthin' nigga, that's what you act like
I ain't like them other niggas boy, you betta act right
The first few years of your deal ride your training wheels
And then you graduate and live how real niggas live
And I ain't dissin', naw, I ain't dissin'
But when you sit back and listen, this what the rap game's is missin'
I'm  used to thug niggas, it's too many young niggas with.
Too much of liquor, too many drugs in em, too many clicks, too much swag nigga,
Too many niggas wearing tight shirts and skinnies, walking round with they ass out
Y'all betta cash out, gon' put your cash up
Because I'm  all in and if I don't win nigga, I'mma mask up

Lawn chair ass niggas all they do is fold
Nigga you talkin' with emotions, you emotional
You might can get a lil' light, feelin promotional
Tell me what cha see when you lookin' in the mirror
Look as this hoe as nigga, I couldn't said it clearer
And you the same nigga that started up this jewelry game
And when you see him  nowadays the nigga jewelry lame
Ain't got it by now, nigga you ain't got it
And why you talkin' like that cause bitch you ain't bout it
And nigga how ya doin' now, worst then before

I've had a good old Baptist raisin'
So I've got no good excuse
I wish that I was stronger
But here's the honest truth

I'm too tired to fight it
Too ashamed to pray
And I'm sure the Lord must be bored
With the promises I've made
So I sit here with my secret
Where no on else can see
I'll just keep it
Between the devil and me

I'm hoping for a miracle
I know that i can change
No I'm not giving up
I know there'll come a day

When I'm not too tired to fight it
Or too ashamed to pray
And I know the Lord won't be bored
With the promises I've made
I won't live here with my secret
Where no one else can see
No I won't keep it

Well, you're too dead set in your ways.

Been viewin' 106 in them cafeterias
Only to find that raps actually serious
Deliriously so its back to crack and vigilance
Same shit to send them up in michigan
Us is pimpin', a difference from any city I've visited
Its that detroit spirit and if we in it

And this place ain't just safe, its just straight gangster
It ain't just new york or la that bangs no more

Eastside them gangs and nothin' but gang lands and
Spray paint cans and when that van rolls up, man they ain't glancin'
That window rolls down and that trey . 8's dancin'
And them shooters don't miss homie, man they hate chancin'
Its straight for the dome and its vacate fast and
Get the fuck outta dodge 'fore that blue dodge flashin'

Then he shall see shells
But not by the seashore if he gangbangin' or not
It's simple as the alphabet
He F with me, that G shall surely see
He definitely is 'bout it, it's retail fraud, he's weak
The honest gesture
The trigger finger 'round the diamond tester, we tail flaw with heat
The same soldier, it's me, myself and I
Ridin' 'round shootin' my biopic and my autobiography
Range Rover, this ain't the squash beef state
You thinkin' makeup, we thinkin' Lark Voorhies face
This twin Eagle's of Ares coupe, might as well ride by in an ambulance
My parachute like skydivin' in Hammer pants
So call it siblin' rivalry
Take his life, call it the unforgivable robbery
A wise man told me that holdin' a grudge is like
Lettin' somebody just live inside of your head rent free

Y'all niggas been bitches, that's none of my business, but I don't sip tea

I still call it safe, I would suck if I was umpirin'

I'm Mr. Big Shot, these hoes get drunk off me
I'm overrespected, my mama gated community's overprotected
So futuristic, I'm already over my next bitch
Reminiscin' on listenin' to 50 fifty times a day
Back when tenth grade was like fifty days away
Tryna get paid fifty ways a day
Used to put fifty on the layaway, now my closet fifty shades of grey
Twenty six and I done lived a lifetime a few times
From futons to Grey Poupons
In church tryna get a little savings, yeah coupons
I spit that A1 every day, I'm hittin' new primes
Now the stakes high, niggas surprised at the new lines
Or takin' down my number like ""you still ain't got a new line?""
Nah it's the same, we've been laborin' for years
I know it took way longer than 9 months, but fuck it, it's all in due time
I turned a blunt to a roach with dreams of bein' a Beatle though
Don't want to, I need to,gotta learn to keep it cerebral

Just a step away from felon, that's why they call it the D
On your bleeder, ho, reason for all of this honesty
Honestly no honor roll, but honor the Phantom stripper pole
'Cause I'm a Linwood nigga, them young niggas say
Put a sack on your head, you bleed out like the reverend
And to think our hood harder then I might break the door
Know some killers pull the trigger for a Swisher and Molly
In a blink I'll hit your kisser, bet you ass ain't rememberin'

Zan got me cross eyed like Bernstein’s son
And these niggas try to copy but I hold on this time
It's us vs them, Detroit vs Everybody yeah

Lately it seems as if it's me against the world
Like it was before my life became a movie
And they used to use my mothafuckin' trailer to tease me with
But I flipped that script like AB filler
Painkillers to pop that lid off that safety seal
It made me feel amazing, made me celebrate me
And if I may reiterate, I ain't even need a script
I ain't bein' conceited, but I made it to radio, eat a dick
I still never ABC the shit
Mainstream appeal and the skill is what made me iller
Since before they called Jay Dee Dilla
I was daydreamin' one day I would be the shit
And if I ever end up escapin' the streets I swear that I would stay here
Still in it, I'm crazy, I'll always be real
Don't make me steal an 18 wheeler
Break all of my friends out of here and take 'em straight to the Mercedes dealer
Peel off back to the same block that we came from, rampage
You crazy for me to flip
What's makin' you think I need a switch? 'Cause I'm Adrian Peterson
When he's raging and heated and on the way to go beat his kid
On the track I spank like he just did
(Detroit!) I can't never leave this bitch
Sick of bein' treated like me and shit, but Jesus
I can just see why people stop callin' me to do features
And them cyphers on BET 'cause if
I wasn't me I probably wouldn't want to play with me neither, shit
Seems to be reachin' this fever pitch, 180 Degrees in here
Trying to wait for the cedar chips
Mcs just bit off more than they can chew like a face full of Swedish Fish
Or Lorena with two penises
Hateful and genius, this inconvenience
And for the record, you won't want this kind of static
In your life, when I'm makin' you cling to it
They consider tryna reinsulate yah
When it's maybe in for another crazy winter
It's so cold in the D, it is as days begin to tick away
But ain't this what really made me into the angry bitter blonde
But ain't we sick of bein' underdog
Don't make me unleash this shit, release this Pit may even seem as if
I'm yankin' your chain a bit or maybe the way in which I'm sayin' shit
Is playin' with your relation, changin' it it's still the same shit and Shady's still a lady killer
Since the day I went insane and attacked the baby sitter
With a potato peeler and mushed her face into the entertainment center
It's like another plane just entered into Ukraine again
The Bermuda Triangle and attempted to make a safety center
Awaiting anyone who ain't affiliated could be danger
Did you make arrangements with the gangsters 'fore you came here?
And if they mention us

Tricky,"Once upon a time not long ago,
When people wore pajamas and lived life slow,
When laws were stern and justice stood,
And people were behavin' like they ought ta good,
There lived a lil' boy who was misled,
By another little boy and this is what he said:
""Me & you tonight are gonna make some cash,
Robbin' old folks and makin' tha dash"",
They did the job, money came with ease,
But one couldn't stop, it's like he had a disease,
He robbed another and another and a sista and her brotha,
Tried to rob a man who was a duty undercover,
The cop grabbed his arm, he started acting erratic,
He said ""Keep still, boy, no need for static"",
Punched him in his belly and he gave him a slap,
But little did he know the little boy was strapped,
The kid pulled out a gun, he said ""Why'd ya hit me ?"",
The barrel was set straight for the cop's kidney,
The cop got scared, the kid, he starts to figure,
""I'll do years if I pull this trigger"",
So he cold dashed and ran around the block,
Cop radioes it to another lady cop,
He ran by a tree, there he saw this sister,
A shot for the head, he shot back but he missed her,
Looked around good and from expectations,
So he decided he'd head for the subway stations,
But she was coming and he made a left,
He was runnin' top speed till he was outta breath,
Knocked an old man down and swore he killed him,
Then he made his move to an abandoned building,
Ran up the stairs up to the top floor,
Opened up the door there, guess who he saw?,
Dave the dope fiend shootin' dope,
Who don't know the meaning of water nor soap,
He said ""I need bullets, hurry up, run!""
The dope fiend brought back a spanking shotgun,
He went outside but there was cops all over,
Then he dipped into a car, a stolen Nova,
Raced up the block doing 83,
Crashed into a tree near a university,
Escaped alive though the car was battered,
Rat-a-tat-tatted and all the cops scattered,
Ran out of bullets and still had static,
Grabbed a pregnant lady, got out the automatic,
Pointed at her head and he said the gun was full o' lead,
He told the cops ""Back off or honey here's dead"",
Deep in his heart he knew he was wrong,
So he let the lady go and he starts to run on,
Sirens sounded, he seemed astounded,
Before long the little boy got surrounded,
He dropped the gun, so went the glory,
And this is the way I must end this story,
He was only seventeen, in a madman's dream,
The cops shot the kid, I still hear him scream,
This ain't funny so don't ya dare laugh,
Just another case 'bout the wrong path,

I bless the child, the earth, the gods and bomb the rest

Hazardous to your health so be friendly

Take a shot like the last of the stand drop
Boom bom bom
Check if alien
That's the time to pull out the handcuffs
Dials a one on a one minute call
Be gone if i never done the cheap rough
She calls and asks when we can fuck
And who else wants the Jungle Lay
So she dials a one on a one minute call
Be gone if i never done the cheap rough
Unless she wants a Jungle Lay
So she calls everyone wonderin' when we can fuck
What does she come to the bar wearin'
'Cause when the girls put on the starin'
I love watchin' all this dancin'
By the girls who are as about as luscious acting
Rude girl and her martial firing
""Ooh well, get the spot!"" they whinin'
Street Dog, they caught me rhymin'
Turned around and got fucking blinded
My favorite beds get no shy women
When or wherever to be drivin'
My take come to the face
When i see that beat goes the drum
And the bass is blastin'
Freak if i bone
It's like i lost control
I'm all alone think i'm toppin'
Get high when i drive a car
And try to drink and drive
When i'm private parking

Shortin' cats in the block of flats

Cops that harrass better watch their backs

Falls well strapped and then broke them flat

Hold gas to the mattress

Drop a match

'Cause that's where your at niggas are off with that

Try and flop me and I'll flop you back

Shout out ""kill"" and the dogs attack

Want a mil, what's with that

We're all 'bout still and shot the crack

Love the bitches with alot of back

Plus the titties, what you got to ask?

I hold my own and rep my niggas
Always oil my guns and inspect my triggas
Sometimes I call my lawyer just to check my figures
He told me not to worry, all cheques is clearin'
So fuck my rhymes, I got the best appearance
And I survive through project experience
You wanna roll dice or roll and ride?
No matter, you gon' get holes inside
See you fuckin' with Theodore Dieni
You fuckin' with a metaphor King Pin

Dun, do you wanna gun to make you slim?
So I'mma pop my collar, get my dollars
Pop all parlors and fuckin' with money scholars
You know what I mean? Matter of fact I'm gonna fuck with rockweilers

Pop your collar (do whatever you do best)
Get your dollar (New York, up the ladder to the hill of success)
Pop all collars (you know what we gonna do)
Just pop your collar (New York, say no more, New York, say no more)

Been off the Jackey Don, rollin' the dice with a happy arm
Everything good, money on wood
Bank stoppers, I send them home broke
Have them all in they stash, bettin' they own coat
I takes it all, fifty and better, you make the call
Watch you break your all, big sixes 'cause I'm a nigga who don't like to fall
High roller, see how my dice kiss
Push you pay me, and if I roll trips you pay me twice bitch
I rocks, believe it or not
Come broke to a dice game, step off and leave with a knot
Head cracks is all you see when I'm hot
What's in the pop? A hunnid G's to the bank to the man, who got it stopped
My hand is like a gun, feel the heat when it's cocked
Four, five, six your heart drop, way deep in your socks
You wanna walk, broke your ass down the street with a bop
The drinks is on you tonight, from my peeps in the spot

Aiyo, what a night, New York City, heard it goin' down
Friday night, midnight, Atlantic City
Slot machines, ding-ding-ding-ding-ding, when they ring off
Lock the doors, that's when Ghost just g'd off
Cigars, paisley robes
Four bitches guardin' me safely as we walk to the window
The cashier was scared, she asked for my info
The manager arrived with two guards, that's an insult
That's the cause, just because
We talkin' bout 5 million dollars here, this ain't Play-doh dough
And your horoscope read, you gon' slay those lows
We got scribbes, Anthony Acid, rockin' the show
Special guest: Starks / Mark Ronson
First five hundred bitches went crazy he let them on and in
All he did was plug me in, I got the chargin'
Got they bras and ran through they whole apartment (la-la-la-la, lalalalalala)

Oooooh weee, ooh wee, (la-la-la-la, lalalalalala)
Oooooh weee, ooh wee, (la-la-la-la, lalalalalala)

When I step into the party, all the ladies want to know
I'm hangin' wit the ballers, yeah, or my nigga Ghost
I can tell you what they say haters, if you want to know
They say ooooooh wee
When I'm roll in my Mercedes, all the ladies want to roll
Be my Juliet and I can be your Romeo
If you actin' menace I can pick another hoe
Oooooooooh weee (la-la-la-la, lalalalalala)
In the middle of the summer, or even twenty below
I'm a bad muthafucka, I'm way to fuckin' cold
Let me tell you what they say, when I'm pullin' off my drawers
They say ooooooooooh weeeee

Aiyo, aiyo
My games here to party, just to cut up a rug
Don't make me want to cut up a thug
Now play something for D.J., 'cause there's nothin' but love
Hosted by the ladies who lookin' for somethin' to rub
When we roll out, we roll on dubs, rollin' up bud
The Theodore Unit, we controllin' the club
Mamies, shakin' they ass, they throwin' it up
Like a B.E.T. commercial, I'm ""wrappin' it up""

Here's a little story ghetto situation
'Bout a girl I met who had many temptations
She was so fly, get high, well understood
Big-a** big brains and straight out the hood

[Ghostface]
Yo,
Ah-yo, I woke up early took a stretch and a yawn
Had a 2 o'clock appointment with this girl name Dawn
She ain't the Avon lady but her beauty was strong

Right before she went to rest she had me singin this song
She must be a special lady
And a very exciting girl
I don't know

She had the high-glow's switchin
See her in the club you hear others chicks b****in
But Dawn quit to bust a b**** a** and s***
See she did 12 months over a ratchet

Not no crab s***
Got bagged with the mag
Taxi cab s***
Clit was hangin out her panties with no where to stash it

It was cla**ic
Nowadays she's laid back
Helpin me perfect my rap
Only pink and smoked salmon where she feed her cat

Wife everything
Diamond cut like johnny lex collar attached
Lickin gla** bowls in her cat clothes
'Cause crazy stacks

Finicky thing
Her kittin drink pollar spring
Take naps
Near her jewerly box

She play with all the rings
And when she step out the tub its like an ill flick
Caramel skin, bath and body works leave the whole room lit
Cinnamon candles, sweet side, they on relax mode

Paint her toes on the bed slow, watchin me
Versace robe on her body, peak, sippin asti (piemonte)
She a perfect 10 in my wildest dreams DAWN

[Cappadonna]
Ah-yo, she gotta be gone
Waitin on my sweet strawbeery pecan rican LaShawn
Holdin my taffy down when I'm gone
Three fourths of her body always covered with clothes

That's why I'm eatin her candy
And suckin her toes
Sweet sexy LaShawn
She got body like what's goin on

On some marvin gay s*** like lets get it onnnnn
Sugar
Let's get it on
Ah-yo she a diamond in the rough

Black rose in the hood
I love my queen and she treat me good
F*** cookin for me
She stash me out when the feds come lookin for me

I'm not cheatin on her or beatin on her
I spend the weekend on her
We on the block when the bills start creepin on her
She right there when it gets sticky

She strict politic to the vicky's
And a fly aviator the color of sky
God on her side

Indian chick with cat eyes
Mad respect with the fat thighs
Plus her guns for the revolution
Would straight leave her if she prostituting

Yo my girls the bomb
Intelligent mind
Sky blue louis vetton
Leg muscles, deep dimples

Body is soft she smell fresh like a new born
Pretty feet peitete a** nice shoes on
The sunshine for my quiet storm
Keepin the food warm while I'm gone

It won't be long 'til I'm back to my sweet butter pecan rican LaShawn
Hit me up baby, P.S. Cappadon'

[Trife]
Ah-yo, ah-yo I woke up in the morning still drunk off the Henn
Had a 3'oclock appointment with this girl name Jen
You know Jen from a hundred and ten, she push the Lex Coupe
Part time fashion designer she work for Jet Blue

Pretty young thing, with a body like vida
A** off the meter, eva medenez look, strut like a diva
Leave her shine fine, blow minds like dimes of a cheeba
She like it from behind, slow grind, sometimes with her feet up

Ms. Bonitta Applebum Bottom, thick as a Roman column
Raw dick it down, love me, even if I'm holdin condoms!
'Cause she my b****, the only cat that I lick
Throwin that a** like Ciara on the top of that whip

Latin decent, velour suit with the cameltoe print
Peppermint flared panties with the garder-belt clips
Tattoo of a small butterfly on her inner thigh
Even at my loneliest times you that Jen will ride...

Yeah, Cinco de Mayo, imported guns from Cairo
Got bagged with the toaster, beat the charge like rhinos
This bitch who's Albino, I met her out in Chi-Town
While I was out in Greek town, ordering gyros
The bad bitch keep a tool and a bible, quick to murder her rivals
And her pops was a gangsta disciple
He killed about a thousand vice lords, guns and knife wars
The feds came for him, so slick to the night ward
Down in the N.O., and right before he left
He wrote his daughter a memo, left stacks in the Benzo
It got hot, niggas selling, giving out the info
He paranoid, every 20 seconds out the window
Blow it in the limbo, he spazzed on Lorenzo
And smashed him in the head with his own son's Nintendo
About a week later, the boys came and rushed him
Kicked down his door, while he sleeping and cuffed him",Black Tequila,2010

I heard what you said, 
And no were not the same, 
No were not the same.

You'll never be a part (of what we have), 
You'll never sing a song (that we love), 
You'll never get respect,
And you can't fool us 
Cause we know what you are.

Went to jail, put the Benz up for bail

Friday night, midnight, Atlantic City
Slot machines, ding-ding-ding-ding-ding, when they ring off
Lock the doors, that's when Ghost just g'd off
Cigars, paisley robes
Four bitches guardin' me safely as we walk to the window
The cashier was scared, she asked for my info
The manager arrived with two guards, that's an insult
That's the cause, just because
We talkin' bout 5 million dollars here, this ain't Play-doh dough
And your horoscope read, you gon' slay those lows
We got scribbes, Anthony Acid, rockin' the show
Special guest: Starks / Mark Ronson
First five hundred bitches went crazy he let them on and in
All he did was plug me in, I got the chargin'
Got they bras and ran through they whole apartment (la-la-la-la, lalalalalala)

Oooooh weee, ooh wee, (la-la-la-la, lalalalalala)
Oooooh weee, ooh wee, (la-la-la-la, lalalalalala)

I can tell you what they say haters, if you want to know

They say ooooooooooh weeeee

Aiyo, aiyo
My games here to party, just to cut up a rug
Don't make me want to cut up a thug
Now play something for D.J., 'cause there's nothin' but love
Hosted by the ladies who lookin' for somethin' to rub
When we roll out, we roll on dubs, rollin' up bud
The Theodore Unit, we controllin' the club
Mamies, shakin' they ass, they throwin' it up
Like a B.E.T. commercial, I'm ""wrappin' it up""

Get this thing through your head
And they will never be no more
Tell me, tell me, about it, damn it

[Jae Millz]
Aiyo, I move with a click that's wreckless
And they ain't got no problem spraying your ass, like disinfectant
So if I feel disrespected, I promise you family
Your body gon' be hollow tip infested
I come from the slums of the 212
H-Dub, Lennox Ave, fuck you gon' do?
We got wild clips duke, with things that'll hit you
And leave a hole so big your moms could put a whole wrist through
Homes, you don't want to push me there
To the point, I gotta leave you in a bush somewhere
Nah, you don't want to push me there
It ain't worth it, dog, homeboy you better - better, huh
Before I aim in you -- huh, it's real
You heard Millz real, and better believe it stupid 'cause --
Nah, come on, Slay you know who to holla at
I'm heavy ever where from Harlem to the bottom where the rude boys and shottas sat
Hell is what I'm giving em, fuck hurtin', I'm killing em
Got legends ready to pick back up they pen and spit again

[Angelous]
I nurture the track, the perfect of rap
Its nonsense how the don, get curved it, to clap
You miss me, simply, I asserted the track
Kay classic, the same game, dog, with packs
Mobsters with the arms up, feel the game wit me
Bomb up, as I conduct, this is Ang' furry, huh
I made berry, the whole league in Jones Beach
And bake berry, the H jerry's is so sweet
So brief, aim's gone, in the building
O.G.'s ain't honor the brilliant, except for the minds
That push the breathe, for the best to colide
Better yet, I put the X in define
Never fret, when it's beef, I put the pep' in the nine
From your brain to my watch, you be ahead of my time
Aim/shift, your brain wrist, the gate aimed to lift
The game will keep going because Angelous exists, bitch

[Cashmere]
What up, it's Cashmere, ya, your new rap fellow
We in hoods like the jam in '86, hello
You know what that means? Ya'll the rap queen
Bunch of bitch niggaz, bow to your new king
And after this there won't be no more
You dudes, is full of hype, that's what TV's for
So, get it through your head, or the nine'll leave, eight holes in your head
Think I'm playing, nigga? I have my peeps pop out my the van
And you lookin like, a soldier out of Pakistan
Ask them dudes on this track, they'll tell you Cash the man
Whatever he doing, trust me, I know I can
I'm ahead of him, eight miles and running
I'm done busting shots, the next hit, the bomb drops
You cocksuckers is about to die, and -- let's go, come on

[Chorus]
[Trife Da God]
Either you get it through the head, or you get it through the leg
Either way, you graze these bullets, is gonna leave you dead
And I ain't freezin' up, when it's time to pull it, you heard what I said
It's Theodore nigga, we all about the bread, niggaz
And it's time for a reality check, yet I'm celeb in the hood
And I ain't even seen a salary yet
Ya'll niggaz flee when my calvary's step
Staten Island we rep, stylin' to death, pumpin' gallons to wet
And like Nick, yeah, I stay with the Cannon
Lay in fours, get, kid you stuck wherever you standing
Lay you on the strip, play you for a bitch, you punk
Pussy, you dealin' with crumbs, so stop actin' like you one tough cookie
I'm not the greatest, I'm the latest, ya'll faggots is imitators
Air you out like venilators, and bang you like skinned potatoes
'cause most of ya'll faggots is sounding like little Jada's

[Maino]
Yo, I speak for the Stuy, Brooklyn is mine, get it through your head
'Fore I round these bullets up and send them through your head
Last nigga tried to stunt, left his hat full of lead
Left the picture that your see, for the inside of F.E.D.S.
I want you to think, that my gun don't burst
My tech'll make niggaz back up like cars in reverse
Definition of a thug, man, put in your work
And nigga act up, you put his work in the earth
Yeah, I'm hotter than you ever was, real? You never was
Hustle hard, nigga, we get you, whatever drugs
Bet you none of ya'll seen, machine guns rattle
So I let off, and let you feel the heat off the barrel
My dogs rocked up, and got you when you hit the gravel
Been a hard hitter, before the Mets signed Darryl
I'm your reaper, when I blast the street sweeper
You bitch niggaz'll crack up like cheap sneakers

[Chorus]
[True Life]
Yo, ya'll niggaz keep talking greasy, like I won't melt ya'll
See me in the streets, got more Smilez than Southstar
Pull your socks up, homey, you know what I'm about, yo
I was pushing rocks, you pushed the Roc, forgot yo's
Lot of niggaz thuggin', but not like me
Put the fifth to your nose, for being nosey
Fuck a throwback jersey, you trying to be Fabolous
End your career, have you resurface like Canibus
Nigga's shouldn't have let me loose
I'm well when I'm sober, imagine off Cran' and Grey Goose
I'm liable to clap the tech
Make you take that chain off, but I don't want a rash on my necklace
Shit, we ain't the same calibur, listen, your don

Smokey Robinson, Tears of a Clown, shedding tears
Popping beers, almost twenty five years in the town
I seen niggas die off, like dandelions in the fall
Niggas heard of Chip Banks and left him lying in the hall
Your boy Sandy Brock was ill, like Kobe Bryant with the ball
It's no exceptions, even the biggest giants gotta fall
Cause we living in denial, but these lessons are vital
When marinating in the slums, you gotta practice survival
Now everybody wants to be next American idol
But these are more than just songs pressed up your vinyl
Being rich is a poor man's dream, and we all wanna shine
But we all can't green, knahImean?
Being rich is a poor man's dream, and we all wanna shine
But we all can't green

I grew up hard, maybe you grew up harder
But I ain't been to many operas
Or had money for private doctors
As harsh it sound, these just a tears of a clown
I grew up hard, maybe you grew up harder
The message is I'm too strong to hold down
I know the ledge, and I ain't planning to drown
As harsh it sound, these just a tears of a clown

Momma ain't raised no fool, they say we gotta save the children
But first, we gotta save our spoons
I was taught not to waste my food
Even if I didn't like it, every scrap on my plate got chewed
Either you ate, or you didn't eat, the memories are bitter sweet
Used to get teased by my friends, cause I had bigger feet
I think about them jokes and laugh, crack a smile
Cause as a child, I never knew that being broke was bad
Growing up I was close to my dad, but that still didn't stop a nigga
From putting that coke in them bags
That was the past, now, I'm riding with the oak in the dash
Got jealous niggas hating, big time, hoping I crash
I can't blame 'em, and on the same note, I can't change 'em
Let a nigga disrespect my shit, I'm gonna flame 'em
That's word to my son little Jay, my little homey
Ask niggas how your boy get down, ain't nothing phony

[Chorus]

Yeah, they say two heads are better than one, and in the process
I learned that slow progress, is better than none
That's why I'm still here pursuing my goals, baking that bread
In the bakery, if I ain't out, doing no shows
I hit the block, once in a blue, and front with the crew
And show niggas a good time, by getting drunk in the stud'
Some niggas find happiness, with a blunt and a brew
They talented niggas, but they just need something to do
It's kinda hard try'nna look beyond buildings and bricks
We can't condone broken homes, when our children is sick
Tryina' survive off the cereal and milk from the WIC
And all the good ones we got, be getting killed in the mix
He could of been the next Jordan, who knows, the next Emmit
Young Tiger Woods, or the new Arthur Ashe of tennis
That's why I'm looking past the gimmicks, getting cash with Dennis
Criminal grind, we gonna smash the business

[Chorus]

Yeah, when you see that big thing pull up
Don't be mad at us, man, be glad, we done made it from the projects
We done came up, Stapleton Houses, man

Trife da God,"[Intro: Ghostface Killah (Mr. Maygreen)]
Aiyo, what up party people (Yeah, my name's on the guest list)
This is the Wallabee kingpin in the building (As Mr. Maygreen... good evening...)
Right about now, I'm about to show you how good we are (I'm in the club, I'm)

[Chorus: Mr. Maygreen]
(Good), I look so, (good), the car look
(Good), I'm in the hood, and I'm okkkkkk
(Good), the jewels look, (good), the girls look
(Good), they all from around the wayyyyy
(Good), hey there, (good), look at you
(Good), me, I'm just passing byyyyyyy
(Good), look at her, (good), time out
(Good), I think I'll give the game a tryyyyy

[Ghostface Killah]
Aiyo, my rose was good, plus my face was good
The way I wear my jeans up over my boots is hood
And my cash is good, the grass, spread it out, over the hash is good
The grasp who be hypecast is good
That's the bird that fucked the game up
Cut the head off lames and platinum niggaz, your boy done came up
Got my aim up, favorite bling with a millennium chains
Chilling, in the staircase, surrounded by killings
With bank rolls, bang those, bang your main hoes
You was in love with the pussy, it ain't the same though
'cause I'm good, she's good, so you should be good
Hit her with the stiff one, she callin' me wood
And we don't love those hoes, with they flat butts caked up
And tipped up toes, need an ill plastic surgeon to fix they nose
'cause they shit is too fat like an adidas sole
Don't even touch my gold, I'm good

[Hook: Mr. Maygreen]
I know you heard it a thousand times
Not quite like my design
You say that's what you looking for
Gator boots walk through the door, now

[Bridge: Ghostface Killah (Mr. Maygreen)]
(Good) Theodore's good, (good), my team is good
(Good) My robes is good, (I'm so good)
(Good) My moms is good, (good), my style is good

(Good) The hood is good, (good), God is good
(Good) Everything is good, come on, let's go

[Ghostface Killah]
Goose over ice cubes, pass the O.J.
Two light skinned wizzes, want Ghost, on both ways
Come here, sit on my lap, it's not a gat, sugar
Have a seat, don't be afraid to move back
Feel that? You'se a nasty girl
Big butt, slim gut, I'll crash your world
It's not polite to bend over in Starkey face
Sheer lace, fat ass, got want me to taste that
Lodi dodi, with a coke shaped body
And my jewels hang low like my balls in the potty
And I dare ya'll to try to rob me
Theodore you, we got the army
A-Town to Mariner's Harby
Wild West, Now Born, go hard, G.
Killa Hill, Stapletown, Port Rich' kids
Pack heat, like I was pulling out biscuits

[Hook]

[Chorus]

[Trife Da God]
When we on the block bubbling rocks, watching for cops
Holding glocks in and out of the spots, (it's all good)
When we overseas, getting that cheese, whipping the hottest V's
Blowin' exotic trees, playa, (it's all good)
When I'm in the whip, sunk in the six, drunk off the liqs
Pull up, stunting, fronting for chicks, (it's all good)
When we on stage getting them Grammy's, snatching them panties
Jetskiing off the shores of Miami, (it's all good)

Trife da God,"[Intro: Ghostface Killah]
God's woman... what's going on?
I know things seem messed up sometime
You stressed out and you can't handle the situation
Sometime it feels like you lacking the guidance
And you don't know what to do... but stay strong
And keep in mind that he always loves you...
It's what it is... that's right sugar love
Come on...

[Chorus: Willie Cottrell]
Josephine, the times are getting tough
Seems to me... you just won't get enough
The rain, won't wash away, your sins...
You'll be here, to do them all over again...

[Ghostface Killah]
Yo, I know this chick from the hood named Courtney Cox
And her brain is easy to pick like faulty locks
She's awfully hot, asshole burning like tobasco
She used to be thick, it's like where the hell her ass go
Started smoking weed and graduated to the pipe
Thought that she could quit but her calculations wasn't right
Infactuated with the life of dope fiends and crack pushers
Prostituting for old pimps who mack hookers
Putting dope in the cook, searching for her vein
Tracks all over her arms, she never felt the pain
The monkey on her back is now a gorilla
Fiending for a hit knowing one day it's gon' kill her
The clinic didn't help (nope) she just another young black woman
Destroying her pretty image and her health
Got me thinking to myself, damn, how could this happen?
I seen her on the corner, nodding off, sniffin' and scratching

[Chorus]

[Trife Da God]
She wakes up, with an urge to get high
Everyday, the same routine, needing the mood of fix to get by
So she reaches for her purse, grab the bag and the needle
Tie a sock her arm and start shooting up the diesel
Had a flesh back, screwing some dude up in his hashback
The night before, body still sore, holding her ass crack
A regular John, she met her through Tom
She passed out with the syringe still stuck in her arm
Dying a slow death, oh, she losing her dear mind
From the troubles of the world, feeling cursed by mankind
Uh, caught up in a desperate rage, was blessed with AIDS
Lost her appetite, hardly slept in days
Now it's too late, praying to Jesus, she fucked around
With the wrong penis, contaminated with diseases
Two months pregnant, carrying around her fetus
But they found her on Broad, in the dumpster, behind the cleaners

[Chorus]

[Interlude: Ghostface Killah]
Josephine, what's wrong, baby?
Come on...

[Ghostface Killah]
Yo, what your momma gonna think of you girl?
Her little baby's all doped up, strung out on the world
Try'nna make some quick cash for a hit of that stash
Listen, baby, you growing up much too fast
Uh, this goes out to every project and every ghetto
For those getting high, using drugs on every level
Living your life, day and night, getting stoned
You better leave those drugs alone, feel me?

[Willie Cottrell]
Up all night, under the party lights
Same old popping and party hopping
All of your so called friends, are leading you down the wrong road
Leading you back to crack, it's a known fact
It is time, that you need me, I'll be there, to help ya
I'll be your leaning pole when you're falling down
I'll be there, when you falling down (sooner or later)
",Josephine,2006
Trife da God,"Thirty thousand feet up in the air, up in the Leer
Dressed in a black tux, forty cal tucked, strapped in a chair
Half-asleep hoppin' out of my seat, caught in a daze
Turned around and saw a white man's face covered in shades
I must've passed out, can't remember shit before I blacked out
Three more niggas approachin' holdin' they macs out
One spoke, gave me the keys to a boat, reached in his trenchcoat 
And pulled out a yellow envelope
Which contained twenty thousand in cash, 
A photograph of a Colombian nigga with a long mustache Miguel Sanchez, 
Keep a gun hidden in his pants' leg with armed bodyguards, 
Surveillance around his land spread
He runs a billion dollar organization under investigation, 
Plus he's wanted by immigration
Now I'm stuck, crazy look on my face, shocked in amazement, 
How the fuck I get involved with these federal agents? 
They knew my background, knew about what happened out in Sac-town, 
They knew about the rap down South, they laid the facts down
Said I had two decisions, take out Miguel and his cartel, 
Or spend the rest of my life in prison
A classified mission on some James Bond shit, 
007-style up against some straight convicts
Now I'm pondering, thoughts wandering, 
Got my girl on the phone, tell her to kiss little J, 
Cause I'll be gone again ""Honey I can't speak."" she suckin' her cheek, 
""If everything go good baby I'll be home in a week.""
Pinchin' myself just to see if I'm dreaming, 
Call up my team and meet me by the docks in Miami, 
I fly out this weekend

I got you nigga, 4-4 pop two niggas, 
That druglord that we want got a spot for niggas, 
And if we kill him, it's back to the block my nigga, he carry Rugers, 
34 shots I figure He only holla at the kid when there's money involved, 
They pack shotguns, hollow tips, dummies and all
But me and Trife doin' right together, 
Got no choice but give us ten, like we sellin' white together, 
Left side 4-5 right black Beretta, takin' trips overseas flippin packs for better, 
Every flight a hundred stacks and better so grind hard, get your money up, get on your grillies, don't mind odds Fuck a cop car, throw on some chumpers and try drop charge, 
Hit the block hard It's kinda hard being G-O-D, 
If he owe Trife, he owe me, load up the mac rounds, 
M-I-A, call that the Jack-Town
Tell niggas I'm on my way, comin' back down, 
Miguel Mr. Sanchez, it's a wrap now Theodore extortin' your shit, 
Handin' out packs now, I used to listen to 50 and jam Back Down, 
Now I sling 50 kilos where I'm at now, 50 a wop,

Black mags in lobbies, with red dots, to detach the body

I'm on the road, not no massive robbery
When it come to that dough, it over flow like paper bag tsunamis
I take shit, lumberjacks and Tommy's

Shorty's strapped with the mac inside her pocket book
Blowing all lots of kush

Just throw ya hands in the sky, don't try to stop the juks
Face down, lay on the ground, no sudden moves
Yo, then, take off his Timbs and get the work out his shoes
Rip off the pockets out his shoes, make sure he come out his used
I hear sirens, plus the cameras is watching, it's time to move
If you lolly-gagging, word to mama, I'll body bag 'im
Leave his frame riddled with holes, looking like Gotti had 'im
Bragging, juked, in the wagon, laughing
We slid a few blocks down, this kid was frozen
With stones so we decided to yapp 'im
I put the tool in his mouth, said ""You don't want the action
These ain't E pills, nigga, these is fuckin aspirin
Bean, blast 'im, Homo' get his girl for his cash and
