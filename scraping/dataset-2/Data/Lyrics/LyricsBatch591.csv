Leslie Clio,"Never knew that love could hurt me
Never knew that I could cry
I believed in happy endings
Till the day you said ""Goodbye""

By now I try, you say ""no""
I could give, but I know
I have let go
Let go

Got so tired of pretending
Going nowhere by your side
How can I know what it feels like
I don`t live inside your mind

But now I try, you say ""no""
I could give, but I know
I have let go
Let go

I want it sparkle, I want it so
Letting you lead out worst one more place to go
I want it easy...see what you blow
But in no happy ending, I be released and so

But now I try, you say ""no""
I could give, but I know
I have let go
Let go

Let go

Let go

Let go

Let go

Leslie Clio,"You said you'd come here
But you're out of sight
Said you'd make it
But it's only lies

And I don't know
Oh I don't know why
But you always
Got me by surprise

You could come home
You could act like I
But you turn to
Something I despise

Said you promise
But you failed to shine
Got into another state of mind

And I don't know
Oh I don't know why
But it never
Causes no surprise

You could come home
You could act like I
But you turn to
Something I despise",Melt Back,2013
Leslie Clio,"You said ""Forget about Francesca, you'll always reign supreme.""
You've just been spending time to pimp your self-esteem
What is it with you, silly silly man?
Once you've had a sweetheart that would have done all she can

Now you're fucking her
Lie around in her bed
But I'm the sweetest gone mama
You ever gonna get

So don't say I didn't
I told you so
I told you so
I told you so
You keep wishing I was her
I'm afraid we don't compare

And don't say I didn't
I told you so
I told you so
I told you so
What am I supposed to play?
Gotta mean just what you say

Memories keep calling
But I refuse to fall
Back to where we started
You never knew me at all
Never met a man that 
Could lie as good as you
I just wonder how she got you
And what she'll put you through

Now you're fucking her
And I hope you're satisfied
You've been busy for a while now
Watch my senses die

Don't say I didn't
I told you so
I told you so
I told you so
You keep wishing I was her
I'm afraid we don't compare

And don't say I didn't
I told you so
I told you so
I told you so
What am I supposed to play?
Gotta mean just what you say

Now you're fucking her
Lie around in her bed
But I'm the sweetest gone mama
You ever gonna get

Now you're fucking her
And I hope you're satisfied
You've been busy for a while now
Watch my senses die

So don't say I didn't
I told you so

Leslie Clio,"All the things we didn't say
Spinning round and round my mind
Holding on to what we've lost
And the things you left behind

There's no you and us
But so much of me
It's a futile desire
And it's not how it's supposed to be

So if you want out
It's alright
Don't need a sad, slow decline
Please be cool to be kind
If you kill this love
You really gotta twist the knife
Twist the knife
Twist the knife
Twist the knife

I keep looking for you baby
In every face I see
I was meant to love you a long time
Never wanted to be free

There's no you and us
But so much of me
It's a futile desire
And it's not how it's supposed to be

So if you want out
It's alright
Don't need a sad, slow decline
Please be cool to be kind
If you kill this love
You really gotta twist the knife

I don't wanna dream of you
Keep you like a sad tattoo
Lay it down, lay it down
Let it die

So if you want out
It's alright
Don't need a sad, slow decline
Please be cool to be kind
If you kill this love
You really gotta twist the knife

So if you want out
It's alright
Don't need a sad, slow decline
Please be cool to be kind
If you kill this love
You really gotta twist the knife

Twist the knife
Twist the knife

Leslie Clio,"You don't need to take my car this week
Haha fuck you
I told you I was leaving

My bags are stowed in Paris
I sleep in daddy's bed
My friends are all I've got now
And I'm raising yellow flags
I'm tired of speaking sweetly
My thoughts ain't sweet no more
I'll set out for a new life
'Cause he's over me for sure

And I'm leaving, and I'm leaving, and I'm leaving, tonight

Too tired to keep going

I'll go back to Manoa
Drink lemons still I'm tired
Won't find no love on Dove's street
But he's alright, he's alright, he's alright
I broke my heart in Paris
And I've had it up to here
I've been putting on my glad rags
'Cause it's best to disappear

And I'm leaving, and I'm leaving, and I'm leaving, tonight

(Hey)
Too tired to keep going
Too tired to keep going

My bags are stowed in Paris
And I've got nothing to bring
I'll fuck off to Waikiki
Get him off my mind again and again
I'll celebrate bad manners
Won't compromise, won't I?
Made friends on Kapahulu
And I'm never coming back

Leslie Clio,"Darkness is a filler
And there happened to be space
If I was someone else, I'd be perfect
If she is what you want
I'm getting tired to be me
Could use to be less alone
And I never stay away from danger
But I could be careful
Got nowhere to go with you, no
Hollow morals marching on
And I'm a lonesome woman alone

And the more I get, the more I lose
The only way up is down
And doves won't fly when I return
The only way up is down

Down, down, down
Down, down, down
Down, down, down
Down, down, down

Darkness is a filler
And there happened to be space
And being someone else would be perfect
Where's my mind gone, where's my mind?
Why did I get so tired?
If she really willing to do what I didn't
And why'd you stop believing in me?
Don't let me paint another picture
Paint another picture
Of the lonesome woman they see

And the more I get, the more I lose
The only way up is down
And doves won't fly when I return
The only way up is down

Down, down, down
Down, down, down
Down, down, down
Down, down, down

A little restlessness stresses less
I walk alone
Maybe someday you'll find me
I hope you still come
Left with my restlessness, restiveness (if I could, I'd believe him)
I walk alone
Maybe someday you you'll find me (I still walk alone)
Someone to call my own

(I still walk alone!)

And the more I get
The more I lose
The only way up is down (down, down, down)
And doves won't fly when I return
The only way up is down

Down, down, down
Down, down, down
Down, down, down

The heart has spoken 
Just look at me now, fragile

Feeling so dumb now (You just seem really evil)

I'm trying hard but your cryptical talking

How many highs and lows?
How many yes and no's?

The night we met
There was magic abroad in the air
There were angels dining at the Ritz
And a nightingale sang in Berkeley square

I may be right I may be wrong
But I'm perfectly willing to swear
That when you turned and smiled at me
A nightingale sang in Berkeley square

The moon that lingered over London town
Poor puzzled moon he wore a frown
How could he know we two were so in love
The whole damned world seemed upside down

The streets of town were paved with stars
It was such a romantic affair
And as we kissed and said goodnight
A nightingale sang in Berkeley square

How strange it was
How sweet and strange
There was never a dream to compare
To those hazy crazy nights we met
And a nightingale sang in Berkeley square

Ah this heart of mine
Loud and fast
Like a merry-go-round in a fair
We would dance cheek to cheek
And a nightingale sang in Berkeley square

The dawn came stealing up
All gold and blue
To interrupt our rendez-vous
I still remember how you smiled and said
Was that a dream or was it true?

Our homeward step was just as light

And like an echo far away

It brings back the sound of music so tender
It brings back a night of tropical splendor
It brings back a memory ever green

I'm with you once more under the stars
And down by the shore an orchestra's playing
And even the palms seem to be swaying
When they begin the beguine

To live it again is past all endeavor
Except when that tune clutches my heart
And there we are, swearing to love forever
And promising never, never to part

What moments divine, what rapture serene
Till clouds came along to disperse the joys we had tasted
And now when I hear people curse the chance that was wasted
I know but too well what they mean

So don't let them begin the beguine
Let the love that was once a fire remain an ember
Let it sleep like the dead desire I only remember
When they begin the beguine

Oh yes, let them begin the beguine, please make them play
Till the stars that were there before return above you
Till you whisper to me once more, ""Darling, I love you""

Turned myself over to you body, mind, and soul

You are the treasure that I've searched for desperately
The tide it races in, its pullin' me out to the sea

I feel a hundred lifetimes deep within your kiss
Don't say a word just hold me close
I hear your heart talkin' to me...

Reverse psychology
Doesn't work on me
It works my nerves

I won't nurse it
I don't buy psyche - so why reverse it?

Games are good for attention (Mmm-yeah!)
But in the end they let you down
Hold me back or let me go
But no more middle ground

Boy, you've got to play your cards right
Get on back to the basics of love
We don't need no mindless mind games
A little give and take - push and shove -
A little honesty is what I'm in need of!

Don't you know I've seen it all
Though I seem naive to you

Just hit me with the truth - yeah!

Push my back against the wall (against the wall)
It's too late for tricks of the trade now
I can escape anything at all - oh!

But I won't fall!

I hear a ticking, it keeps on ticking
Though it`s only inside my head
The light is flicking, and hell is kicking

That`s running out of sand
I`m looking through the hourglass
Into another land

[Verse 2:]
I hear a crying of people dying
And it`s taking me to the street
Intensifying a self-denying
That bringing will starve defeat

[Repeat Chorus]
[Bridge:]
Time is sifting away so fast
Loving...I`ve got to love what lasts
`Cause where you hide your treasure
You hide your heart
If you hide it in this world
You know it`s gonna fall apart

You think I've forgotten all you`re dreaming of
But how could I forget the one I love
And it`s

I can see your heart is tired
And your courage has worn thin
You wonder how long you will have to hang on
But when My love comes in, you`ll be strong again

These mountains will be removed
I`ll build my temple in you
And what I've promised shall be done

Would disappear at dawn with the fading moon

You`ll see how long it takes for love to be
In the light of love
I`ll wait to have you and you`ll wait to have me

Leslie Phillips,"I met you once backstage
At a very tender age
You took me under your wing
And I remember
Those seas of screaming hands
Were at your own command
So hypnotized when you sing

And there seemed to be a price to pay
Getting bigger every day

And you were larger than life
You were graded up to 'hero'
Larger than life
And it must be hard to keep living
The things that you say
When they're making you larger than life

I'm learning what it means
To be somebody's dream
When I'm looking for the dream myself
But that's not really me
They're twisting what they see
Its only one hero to Hell

And there seems to be a price to pay
Getting higher every day

Larger than life
We're graded up to 'hero'
Larger than life
And you know its hard to keep living
The things that we say
When they're making us larger
Larger than life

And the higher you're above it all
The easier it is to fall

Larger than life

Leslie Phillips,"Have you seen my girl? 
She's the one with the curly hair. 
She was sitting just right over there, now she's nowhere to be found. 

I think she's mad at me. 
I don't know why. 
Maybe because I made her cry when I told her I was down. 

She only likes me when I'm high
She's always trying to get me stoned
She wants to see me in her sky
And has to have me there alone
She's got me on my knees, begging baby, baby please! 
Don't hurt me, no, don't hurt me so 

As a gentleman 
I do everything I can to be 
A law-abiding kind of energy, 
Yet stimulating all the while

Then she comes around. 
I don't know why. 
I always go too fucking far 
And end up puking on the bathroom tile, oh my!

She tracks me down, 
She's bound to drag me down",Smoke Screen,1985

But my heart fights back

Pulling my mind
Back and forth
All the time

In the stillness of my lonely room

But I`m so torn apart

I can still remember how
That music used to make me smile
And I knew if I had my chance
That I could make those people dance
And maybe they'd be happy for a while

But February made me shiver
With every paper I'd deliver
Bad news on the doorstep
I couldn't take one more step

I can't remember if I cried
When I read about his widowed bride
Something touched me deep inside
The day the music died
So

Bye, bye Miss American Pie
Drove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry
And them good ole boys were drinking whiskey and rye
Singin' this'll be the day that I die
This'll be the day that I die

Did you write the book of love
And do you have faith in God above
If the Bible tells you so?
Do you believe in rock and roll?
Can music save your mortal soul?
And can you teach me how to dance real slow?

Well, I know that you're in love with him
'Cause I saw you dancin' in the gym
You both kicked off your shoes
Man, I dig those rhythm and blues

I was a lonely teenage broncin' buck
With a pink carnation and a pickup truck
But I knew I was out of luck
The day the music died
I started singin'

Bye, bye Miss American Pie
Drove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry
And them good ole boys were drinking whiskey and rye
Singin' this'll be the day that I die
This'll be the day that I die

Now, for ten years we've been on our own
And moss grows fat on a rolling stone
But, that's not how it used to be

When the jester sang for the king and queen
In a coat he borrowed from James Dean
And a voice that came from you and me

Oh and while the king was looking down
The jester stole his thorny crown
The courtroom was adjourned
No verdict was returned

And while Lennon read a book on Marx
The quartet practiced in the park
And we sang dirges in the dark
The day the music died
We were singin'

Bye, bye Miss American Pie
Drove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry
Them good ole boys were drinking whiskey and rye
And singin' this'll be the day that I die
This'll be the day that I die

Helter skelter in a summer swelter
The birds flew off with a fallout shelter
Eight miles high and falling fast

It landed foul on the grass
The players tried for a forward pass
With the jester on the sidelines in a cast

Now the half-time air was sweet perfume
While sergeants played a marching tune
We all got up to dance
Oh, but we never got the chance

'Cause the players tried to take the field
The marching band refused to yield
Do you recall what was revealed
The day the music died?
We started singin'

Bye, bye Miss American Pie
Drove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry
Them good ole boys were drinking whiskey and rye
And singin' this'll be the day that I die
This'll be the day that I die

Oh, and there we were all in one place
A generation lost in space
With no time left to start again

So come on Jack be nimble, Jack be quick
Jack Flash sat on a candlestick
'Cause fire is the devil's only friend

Oh and as I watched him on the stage
My hands were clenched in fists of rage
No angel born in Hell
Could break that Satan's spell

And as the flames climbed high into the night
To light the sacrificial rite
I saw Satan laughing with delight
The day the music died
He was singin'

Bye, bye Miss American Pie
Drove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry
Them good ole boys were drinking whiskey and rye
Singin' this'll be the day that I die
This'll be the day that I die

I met a girl who sang the blues
And I asked her for some happy news
But she just smiled and turned away

I went down to the sacred store
Where I'd heard the music years before
But the man there said the music wouldn't play

And in the streets the children screamed
The lovers cried, and the poets dreamed
But not a word was spoken
The church bells all were broken

And the three men I admire most
The Father, Son, and the Holy Ghost
They caught the last train for the coast
The day the music died
And they were singing

It brings back a night of tropical splendor
It brings back a memory ever green

And down by the shore an orchestra's playing
And even the palms seem to be swaying
When they begin the beguine

Except when that tune clutches my heart
And there we are, swearing to love forever
And promising never, never to part

Till clouds came along to disperse the joys we had tasted
And now when I hear people curse the chance that was wasted
I know but too well what they mean

Let the love that was once a fire remain an ember
Let it sleep like the dead desire I only remember

Love, love, hooray for love!
Who was ever too proud, say, for love?
Make this a night for love,
If we have to fight, let's fight for love!

Some sigh and cry for love,
Ah, but in Paree they die for love!
Some waste away for love;
Just the same, hooray for love!

It's a rocket to yhe moon,
With a touch of ""Clare De Lune""!
It gets you high, it gets you low,
But once you get that glow, oh!

Some trust to fate for love,
Others have to take off weight for love!
Some go berserk for love,
Lovers even go to work for love!

Sad songs are sobbed for love,
People have their noses bobbed for love!
some say we pay for love,
Just the same, hooray for love!",Hooray for Love [DVD],2006
Leslie Uggams,"All our friends keep knocking at the door
They've asked me out a hundred times or more
But all I say is, ""Leave me in the gloom""
And here I stay within my lonely room
'Cause

I don't want to walk without you, Baby
Walk without my arm about you, Baby
I thought the day you left me behind
I'd take a stroll and get you right off my mind
But now I find that
I don't want to walk without the sunshine
Why'd you have to turn off all that sunshine?

Leslie Uggams,"I cried a tear, you wiped it dry
I was confused, you cleared my mind
I sold my soul, you bought it back for me

You gave me strength to stand alone again
To face the world out on my own again
You put me high upon a pedestal
So high that I could almost see eternity
You needed me, you needed me

And I can't believe it's you
I can't believe it's true
I needed you and you were there
And I'll never leave, why should I leave?
I'd be a fool 'cause I finally found someone who really cares

You held my hand when it was cold
When I was lost you took me home
You gave me hope when I was at the end
And turned my lies back into truth again
You even called me ""friend""

Don't try following me
Don't cry, little Robin-Marie
'Cause you know I'm coming home soon

My ships' leaving on a three-year tour
The next tide will take us from shore
Windlaced, gather in sail and spray
On a search for the mighty sperm whale

Fly your willow branches
Wrap your body round my soul
Lay down your reeds and drums on my soft sheets
There are years behind us reaching
To the place where hearts are beating
And I know you're the last true love I'll ever meet

Starbuck's sharpening his harpoon
The black man's playing his tune
An old salt's sleeping his watch away
He'll be drunk again before noon

Three years sailing on bended knee
We found no whales in the sea
Don't cry, little Robin-Marie
'Cause we'll be in sight of land soon",Nantucket Sleighride,2013

I'd fall like a tear so your light could shine through

'Til there's no way to know where you end and where I begin

The cobblestone midnight is where we first meet

And under your willow they laid me down 
There'll be no trace that one was once two

Lester Alexis,"I used to have a perfect sweetheart
Not a real one, just a dream
A wonderful vision of us as a team
Can you imagine how I feel now
Love is real now, it's ideal
You're just what I wanted
And now it's nice to live
Paradise to live

I know why I've waited
Know why I've been blue
Prayed each night for someone
Exactly like you

Why should we spend money
On a show or two
No one does those love scenes
Exactly like you

You make me feel so grand
I want to hand the world to you
I hope you'll understand
Each foolish little scheme I'm schemin'
And dream I'm dreamin'

Taught me to be true

It seems I met you when my love went away
Now everyday I start by saying to you
Good morning heartache, what's new

Lester Bowie,"Oh! they say some people long ago
Were searching for a diff'rent tune
One that they could croon 
As only they can

They only had the rhythm so
They started swaying to and fro
They didn't know just what they had
And that is how the blues really began

They heard the breeze in the trees
Singing weird melodies
And they made that 
The start of the blues

And from a jail came the wail
Of a down hearted frail
And they played that 
As part of the blues

From a whippoorwill out on a hill
They took a new note
Pushed it through a horn
'til it was born into a blue note

And then they nursed it, rehearsed it
And gave out the news
That the southland 
Gave birth to the blues!",Birth of the Blues,1999
Lester Bowie,"It won't be easy, you'll think it strange
When I try to explain how I feel
That I still need your love after all that I've done
You won't believe me, all you will see is a girl you once knew
Although she's dressed up to the nines
At sixes and sevens with you
I had to let it happen, I had to change
Couldn't stay all my life down at heel

Looking out of the window, staying out of the sun
So I chose freedom, running around trying everything new
But nothing impressed me at all
I never expected it to

Don't cry for me, Argentina
The truth is, I never left you
All through my wild days, my mad existence
I kept my promise 
Don't keep your distance

And as for fortune, and as for fame
I never invited them in
Though it seemed to the world they were all I desired
They are illusions, they're not the solutions they promised to be
The answer was here all the time
I love you, and hope you love me
Don't cry for me, Argentina

Don't cry for me, Argentina
The truth is, I never left you
All through my wild days, my mad existence
I kept my promise 
Don't keep your distance

That every word is true",Don't Cry for Me Argentina,1999

As I gaze out of my window
At the moon in it's flight
My thoughts all stray, stray to you

In the still of the night
While the world lies in slumber
Oh the times without number
When I say to you

Do you love me
Just like I love you
Are you my life to be

'Cause he can't seem to keep his self out of trouble.
So, he goes out and he makes his money the best way he know how,

And like his promise is true
Only my faith can undo
The many chances I blew
To bring my life to anew

Have dried the tears from my eyes

Is for the folk who can't cope
Wit such an endurin' pain
That it keeps 'em in the pourin' rain

For tootin' caine in your own vein
What a shame
You shoot and aim for someone else's brain
You claim the insane
And name this day in time
For fallin prey to crime

Dreams are hopeless aspirations
In hopes of comin' true
Believe in yourself
The rest is up to me and you

Il silenzio che ti fa mia!

When we fell in love
We were so young and innocent then

We'd be together all day long
Do you remember
Us holding hands
In each other's eyes we'd stare

All the things we said like
I love you so I'll never let you go

Back in the Spring
Every morning birds would sing
Do you remember
Those special times
They'll just go on and on

When we fell in love
Do you remember the time
When we first met girl

Open it let's see if we're real, we all suited
Beg my pardon to Martin

Everyday in the ghetto

And a pen and a pad to hit the label kick it

To the dome wit a shot of bird
Never get tossed to the curb
Be feelin that urge to splurge
But I'm broke as fuck son gimme that Mossberg swerve
Up into my bag, cause I gotta get my mask and shells
To put in this twelve gauge sawed off

Gotta go purchase a dime
Put in a state to get done with the crime
Smokin the reefer to ease my mind
Swig some wine, step on the block with the rocks
But Willie be servin em clemency
Gotta buck him on down if he come back talkin
Like gimme back me money
Thuggin with me killers, need us a leader
Or liquor but niggaz ain't got shit

Sometimes the sun goes 'round the moon
I see the passion in your eyes
Sometimes it's all a big surprise
'Cause there was a time when all I did was wish
You'd tell me this was love
It's not the way I hoped or how I planned
But somehow it's enough

And now we're standing face to face
Isn't this world a crazy place
Just when I thought our chance had passed
You go and save the best for last

All of the nights you came to me
When some silly girl had set you free
You wondered how you'd make it through
I wondered what was wrong with you

'Cause how could you give your love to someone else
And share your dreams with me
Sometimes the very thing you're looking for
Is the one thing you can't see

Lester Bowie's Brass Fantasy,"A lonely mother gazing out of her window 
Staring at a son that she just can't touch.
If at any time he's in a jam she'll be by his side, 
But he doesn't realize he hurts her so much.
But all the praying just ain't helping at all, 
'Cause he can't seem to keep his self out of trouble.
So, he goes out and he makes his money the best way he know how,
Another body laying cold in the gutter.
Listen to me.
 
Don't go chasing waterfalls.
Please stick to the rivers and the lakes that you're used to.
I know that you're gonna have it your way or nothing at all, 
But I think you're moving too fast.
 
Little precious has a natural obsession for temptation, 
But he just can't see.
She give him loving that his body can't handle, 
But all he can say is, ""Baby, it's good to me.""
One day he goes and takes a glimpse in the mirror, 
But he doesn't recognize his own face.
His health is fading and he doesn't know why.
Three letters took him to his final resting place.
Y'all don't hear me.
 
Don't go chasing waterfalls.
Please stick to the rivers and the lakes that you're used to.
I know that you're gonna have it your way or nothing at all, 
But I think you're moving too fast.
 
I seen rainbow yesterday
But too many storms have come and gone
Leavin' a trace of not on God-given ray
Is it because my life is ten shades of gray
I pray all ten fade away
Seldom praise Him for the sunny days
And like his promise is true
Only my faith can undo
The many chances I blew
To bring my life to anew
Clear blue and unconditional skies
Have dried the tears from my eyes
No more lonely cries
My only bleedin' hope
Is for the folk who can't cope
Wit such an endurin' pain
That it keeps 'em in the pourin' rain
Who's to blame
For tootin' caine in your own vein
What a shame
You shoot and aim for someone else's brain
You claim the insane
And name this day in time
For fallin prey to crime
I say the system got you victim to your own mind
Dreams are hopeless aspirations
In hopes of comin' true
Believe in yourself
The rest is up to me and you
 
Don't go chasing waterfalls.
Please stick to the rivers and the lakes that you're used to.
I know that you're gonna have it your way or nothing at all, 
But I think you're moving too fast.

Lester Chambers,"On Monday I wished it was Tuesday night
So I could wish for the weekend to come
On Tuesday I wished that the night would pass
So I could call you on the phone
Now a man can spend a lot of time
Wondering what was on Jack Ruby's mind 
And time is all I have without you here 

On Wednesday when you hung up
It was as much as I could do
To stop from wishing Thursday
Would pass so quickly too
They're out there making history
In the Lenin Shipyards today
And here I am in the Hammersmith Hotel
Wishing the days away

There's always room for one more soul
Down in the Human Zoo
I don't want you to come here though
I want to come home to you
Somebody's knocking at the door
Its later than I think
And its time to put on these stinking clothes
And get out there and stink

On Friday I wished there was something more
To be seen in the letters you send
On Saturday I wished it was Sunday
Oh will this torment ever end
Sometimes I get a notion to put a torch
To the tools of my trade
Here I am in the Hammersmith Hotel
Wishing the days away

Shes everything on this earth to me.

Just how great a burden my mother had
Adoption was offered but mama said no
She raised us and taught us the right way to go

I wanna go to heaven when this life is over
I wanna be with Jesus on eternity shore
But if I've a crown coming when rewards go around
Please blessed Jesus give mother my crown

Your form
Your silhouette

In the attic in my mind
And you've been getting by without me
But I've been spending all my time
With a girl that I remember
Who'll never leave or need to grow
'cause when you left you left your memory
Now it's the only thing I know

When the past gives me no comfort
And though the future is the cost
The way I'm choosing to remember
I'll forever be the man I never was

And you, you fade
But the memory remains the same
And I, I can't change
And I think that living with your memory
Is slowly driving me insane

You are perfect but you're empty
And it gets so lonely in my mind
'cause your image in my memory's
The only shred of you that's left behind
You were real but then you left me
And that's the part I can't accept
So I'll keep on living with your memory
Because it's all that I've got left

A little room where all the roses bloom
I want to lead you into Nature's hall
Where ev'ry year the roses give a ball
They have an orchestra up in the trees
For their musicians are the birds and bees
And they will sing us a song
As we are strolling along
 
In sunny Roseland, where summer breezes are playing
Where the honey bees are ""A-Maying""
There all the roses are swaying
Dancing while the meadow brook flows
The moon when shining is more than ever designing
For 'tis ever then I am pining
Pining to be sweetly reclining
Somewhere in Roseland
Beside a beautiful rose
 
The ball is over and tulips meet
Their little kisses are so short and sweet
The lilies nod to the forget-me-nots
When they're departing in their flower pots
But all the roses with their spirits high
Remain to love until they droop and die
And dear, why shouldn't it be
Just so with you and with me

Like a nightingale without a song to sing
Oh, why should I have Spring fever
When it isn't even spring?

I keep wishing I were somewhere else
Walking down a strange new street
Hearing words that I have never heard
From a girl I've yet to meet

I'm as busy as a spider spinning daydreams
I'm as giddy as a baby on a swing
I haven't seen a crocus or a rosebud or a robin on the wing
But I feel so gay in a melancholy way
That it might as well be spring

It might as well be spring",It Might as Well Be Spring,2000

Anyone can whistle any old day, easy

I can slay a dragon any old week, easy

Lower my guard, learn to be free
Maybe if you whistle, whistle for me

Silk stockings thrown aside dance invitations

Don't know why it happened,
Don't know how it started,
Why should we be strangers,
After all we planned.

I can't show my face,
Can't go anyplace,

We send out invitations,
To friends and relations,
Announcing our weddin' day
Friends and our relations,
Gave congratulations,
How can you face them?
What can you say?
 
Let's make up sweetheart,
We can't stay apart,
Don't let foolish pride,
Keep you from my side,
How can love like ours be ended?

Out of town were the people I knew
I had that feeling of self-pity
What to do, what to do, what to do
The outlook was decidedly blue

But as I walked through the foggy streets alone
It turned out to be the luckiest day I've known

A foggy day, in London town
Had me low, had me down
I viewed the morning, with much alarm
British Museum, had lost its charm

How long I wondered,
Could this thing last
But the age of miracles, hadn't past
For suddenly, I saw you there
And through foggy London town,
The sun was shining everywhere

And when you smiled at me,
In my heart I felt a thrill you see,

Still I never dreamed that you could love me too.

Your eyes of blue, your kisses too,
I never knew what they could do.

Thrilling me again
Like that night in spain
Someone is sharing my memories
Wonder does she grieve
Every lovely evening
 
In a little Spanish town
'Twas on a night like this
Stars were peek-a-booing down
'Twas on a night like this
I whispered ""Be true to me""
And she sighed: ""Si, Si""
Many skies have turned to gray
Because we're far apart
Many moons had passed away
And still she's in my heart
We made a promise and sealed it with a kiss
In a little Spanish town
'Twas on a night like this
 
Somehow I keep on remembering
Tears that said goodbye
Shining in her eye
Wonder does she keep remembering
Promises of mine
When the moon is shining

I felt a bump and heard an ""Oh, beg your pardon""
Suddenly I saw polka dots and moonbeams
All around a pug-nosed dream

The music started and was I the perplexed one
I held my breath and said ""May I have the next one?""
In my frightened arms, polka dots and moonbeams
Sparkled on a pug-nosed dream

There were questions in the eyes of other dancers
As we floated over the floor
There were questions but my heart knew all the answers

Oh, I have always been a wanderer
Over land and sea,
Yet a moonbeam on the water
Casts a spell o'er me;
A vision fair I see,
Again I long to be;

Back home again in Indiana,
And it seems that I can see
The gleamin' candlelight,
Still shinin' bright,
Through the sycamores for me.

The new mown hay sends all its fragrance
From the fields I used to roam.
When I dream about the moonlight on the Wabash,
Then I long for my Indiana home,

And they will sing us a song
As we are strolling along
 
In sunny Roseland, where summer breezes are playing
Where the honey bees are ""A-Maying""
There all the roses are swaying
Dancing while the meadow brook flows
The moon when shining is more than ever designing
For 'tis ever then I am pining
Pining to be sweetly reclining
Somewhere in Roseland
Beside a beautiful rose
 
The ball is over and tulips meet
Their little kisses are so short and sweet
The lilies nod to the forget-me-nots
When they're departing in their flower pots
But all the roses with their spirits high
Remain to love until they droop and die
And dear, why shouldn't it be
Just so with you and with me

Lester Young,"Pride, sad, splendid liar,  
Sworn enemy of love
Kept my lips from saying
Things I was thinking of.
But now my pride you've humbled,
I've cast it to the winds,
Broken, beaten, sick at heart
My confession begins.
 
We've played the game of stay away
But it cost more that I can pay.
Without you I can't make my way,
I surrender, dear.

I may seem proud, I may act gay,
It's just a pose, I'm not that way,
'Cause deep down in my heart I say
I surrender, dear.

Little mean things we were doing
Must have been part of the game,
Lending a spice to the wooing,
But I don't care who's to blame.
When stars appear and shadows fall,
Why then you'll hear My poor heart call,
To you my love, my life, my all
I surrender, dear.

I felt a bump and heard an ""Oh, beg your pardon""
Suddenly I saw polka dots and moonbeams
All around a pug-nosed dream

The music started and was I the perplexed one
I held my breath and said ""May I have the next one?""
In my frightened arms, polka dots and moonbeams
Sparkled on a pug-nosed dream

As we floated over the floor
There were questions but my heart knew all the answers
And perhaps a few things more

I know the meaning of the words ""Ever after""
And I'll always see polka dots and moonbeams
When I kiss the pug-nosed dream",Polka Dots & Moonbeams,2003

Just glad I'm livin' and lucky to be

She'd be unhappy without me I know

Still she's diff'rent from the rest, satisfied with me.

Can't help feeling it's a dream, Too good to be true. 

Never had nothin'; no one to care
That's why I seem to have more than my share,
I got a woman, crazy for me,
She's funny that way.

When I hurt her feelings, once in a while,
Her only answer is one little smile,
I got a woman crazy for me.

End it all and let her go to some better man;

Lester Young-Buddy Rich Trio,"I'm a very ordinary man
Trying to work out life's happy plan
Doing unto others as I'd like to have them doing unto me

When I find a very lonely soul
Soon be-kinda-comes my only goal
I feel so much better when I tell them my philosophy

I want to be happy
But I won't be happy
Till I make you happy too.

Life's really worth living
When we are mirth giving
Why can't I give some to you

When skies are gray and you say you are blue
I'll send the sun smiling through

I want to be happy
But I won't be happy
Till I make you happy too.

Lester Young-Teddy Wilson Quartet,"You took my kisses and all my love
You taught me how to care
Am I to be just remnant of a one side love affair

All you took
I gladly gave
There is nothing left for me to save

All of me
Why not take all of me
Can't you see
I'm no good without you
Take my lips
I want to lose them
Take my arms
I'll never use them
Your goodbye left me with eyes that cry
How can I go on dear without you
You took the part that once was my heart
So why not take all of me",All of Me,1956
Lester Young-Teddy Wilson Quartet,"It's very clear, our love is here to stay
Not for a year but ever and a day
The radio and the telephone and the movies that we know
May just be passing fancies and in time may go

But oh, my dear, our love is here to stay
Together we're going a long, long way

Lester Young-Teddy Wilson Quartet,"Love me or leave me and let me be lonely
You won't believe me that I love you only
I'd rather be lonely than happy with somebody else

You might find the night time the right time for kissing
But night time is my time for just reminiscing
Regretting instead of forgetting with somebody else
There'll be no else unless that someone is you, you, you

I intend to be independently blue
I want your love but I don't want to borrow
I have it today and give back tomorrow
For my love is your love but there's no love for nobody else",Love Me or Leave Me,1956
Lester Young-Teddy Wilson Quartet,"Someone that I belong to
Doesn't belong to me
Someone who can't be faithful
Knows that I have to be
Wonder if I am wrong to give her my loyalty

Why should I be a lone soul
Why can't I be my own soul
Alone from night to night you'll find me
Too weak to break the chains that bind me
I need no shackles to remind me
I'm just a prisner of love
For one comand I stand and wait now

From one who's master of my Fate now
I can't escape for it's too late now
I'm just a prisoner of love
What's the good of my caring if someone is sharing
Those arms with me
Although she has another
I can't have another
For I'm not free
She's in my dreams awake or sleeping
Up on my knees to her I'm creeping
My very life is in her keeping
I'm just a prisoner of love.

Lester Young-Teddy Wilson Quartet,"Here I go again, I hear those trumpets blow again.
All aglow again, takin' a chance on love.
Here I slide again, about to take that ride again.
Starry-eyed again, takin' a chance on love.

I thought that cards were a frame-up, I never would try.
Now I'm taking that game up and the ace of hearts is high.
Things are mending now, I see a rainbow blending now.
We'll have a happy ending now, takin' a chance on love.

Here I slip again, about to take that trip again.
I got that grip again, takin' a chance on love.
Now I prove again that I can make life move again.
Um - I'm in the groove again, takin' a chance on love.

I walk around with a horse shoe, in clover I lie.
And brother rabbit of course you better kiss your, foot good-bye.
On that ball again I'm ridin' for a fall again.
I'm gonna give my all again takin' a chance on love.",Taking a Chance on Love,1956
Lester Young-Teddy Wilson Quartet,"I was a stranger in the city
Out of town were the people I knew
I had that feeling of self-pity
What to do, what to do, what to do
The outlook was decidedly blue

But as I walked through the foggy streets alone
It turned out to be the luckiest day I've known

A foggy day, in London town
Had me low, had me down
I viewed the morning, with much alarm
British Museum, had lost its charm

How long I wondered,
Could this thing last
But the age of miracles, hadn't past
For suddenly, I saw you there
And through foggy London town,
The sun was shining everywhere

It brings back the sound of music so tender
It brings back a night of tropical splendor
It brings back a memory ever green

I'm with you once more under the stars
And down by the shore an orchestra's playing
And even the palms seem to be swaying
When they begin the beguine

To live it again is past all endeavor
Except when that tune clutches my heart
And there we are, swearing to love forever
And promising never, never to part

What moments divine, what rapture serene
Till clouds came along to disperse the joys we had tasted
And now when I hear people curse the chance that was wasted
I know but too well what they mean

So don't let them begin the beguine
Let the love that was once a fire remain an ember
Let it sleep like the dead desire I only remember
When they begin the beguine

Oh yes, let them begin the beguine, please make them play
Till the stars that were there before return above you
Till you whisper to me once more, ""Darling, I love you""

Always a dry run
Never one to jump the gun
