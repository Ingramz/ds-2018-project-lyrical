Anders Johansson,"Love me tender, love me sweet
Never let me go
You have made my life complete
And I love you so

Love me tender, love me true
All my dreams fulfill
For my darling I love you
And I always will

Love me tender, love me long
Take me to your heart
For it's there that I belong
And will never part

Love me tender, love me true
All my dreams fulfill
For my darling I love you
And I always will

Love me tender, love me dear
Tell me you are mine
I'll be yours through all the years
'Til the end of time

Love me tender, love me true
All my dreams fulfill
For my darling I love you
And I always will",Love Me Tender,2002
Anders Johansson,"How do I begin to stop loving you?
How do I go on by letting go?
How do I pretend I know what to do?
And deep inside I know that I don't.

My heart is weak
Too tired to sleep
I'm incomplete
Like a day without sunshine
God only knows
This faded soul will stand alone
Waiting on sunshine.

How do I forget to remember you?
To tell me how to mend a broken heart
How can I explain what I'm going through?
It's like trying to find a shadow in the dark.

My heart is weak
Too tired to sleep
I'm incomplete
Like a day without sunshine
God only knows
This faded soul will stand alone
Waiting on sunshine.

Oh yeah
Sunshine sunshine

Ooooh
My heart is weak
I just can't sleep
I'm in too deep
Waiting on sunshine
And God only knows
That this faded soul will stand alone
Waitin' on
Waiting on sunshine

Sunshine sunshine
Sunshine sunshine

Waiting on sunshine.",Sunshine,
Anders Jormin,"Por la blanda arena
Que lame el mar
Su pequeña huella
No vuelve más
Un sendero solo
De pena y silencio llegó
Hasta el agua profunda
Un sendero solo
De penas mudas llegó
Hasta la espuma

Sabe Dios qué angustia
Te acompañó
Qué dolores viejos
Calló tu voz
Para recostarte
Arrullada en el canto
De las caracolas marinas
La canción que canta
En el fondo oscuro del mar
La caracola

Te vas Alfonsina
Con tu soledad
Qué poemas nuevos
Fuíste a buscar?
Una voz antigüa
De viento y de sal
Te requiebra el alma
Y la está llevando
Y te vas hacia allá
Como en sueños
Dormida, Alfonsina
Vestida de mar

Cinco sirenitas
Te llevarán
Por caminos de algas
Y de coral
Y fosforescentes
Caballos marinos harán
Una ronda a tu lado
Y los habitantes
Del agua van a jugar
Pronto a tu lado

Bájame la lámpara
Un poco más
Déjame que duerma
Nodriza, en paz
Y si llama él
No le digas que estoy
Dile que Alfonsina no vuelve
Y si llama él
No le digas nunca que estoy
Di que me he ido

Te vas Alfonsina
Con tu soledad
¿Qué poemas nuevos
Fueste a buscar?
Una voz antigua
De viento y de sal
Te requiebra el alma
Y la está llevando
Y te vas hacia allá
Como en sueños
Dormida, Alfonsina
Vestida de mar",Alfonsina,1991
Anders Jormin,"Gracias a la vida que me ha dado tanto
Me dio dos luceros, que cuando los abro,
Perfecto distingo lo negro del blanco
Y en el alto cielo su fondo estrellado
Y en las multitudes el hombre que yo amo

Gracias a la vida que me ha dado tanto
Me ha dado el oido que en todo su ancho
Graba noche y dia, grillos y canarios,
Martillos, turbinas, ladridos, chubascos,
Y la voz tan tierna de mi bien amado

Gracias a la vida que me ha dado tanto
Me ha dado el sonido y el abecedario;
Con el las palabras que pienso y declaro:
Madre, amigo, hermano, y luz alumbrando
La ruta del alma del que estoy amando

Gracias a la vida que me ha dado tanto
Me ha dado la marcha de mis pies cansados;
Con ellos anduve ciudades y charcos,
Playas y desiertos, montanas y llanos,
Y la casa tuya, tu calle y tu patio

Gracias a la vida que me ha dado tanto
Me dio el corazon que agita su marco
Cuando miro el fruto del cerebro humano,
Cuando miro al bueno tan lejos del malo,
Cuando miro al fondo de tus ojos claros

Gracias a la vida que me ha dado tanto
Me ha dado la risa y me ha dado el llanto
Asi yo distingo dicha de quebranto,
Los dos materiales que forman mi canto,
Y el canto de ustedes que es mi mismo canto,
Y el canto de todos que es mi propio canto
Gracias a la vida que me ha dado tant",Gracias a La Vida,2001
Anders Jormin,"I remember holdin' on to you
All them long and lonely nights I put you through
Somewhere in there I'm sure I made you cry
But I can't remember if we said goodbye

But I recall all of them nights down in Mexico
One place I may never go in my life again
Was I just off somewhere just too high
But I can't remember if we said goodbye

I only miss you here every now and then
Like the soft breeze blowin up from the Carribean
Most Novembers I break down and cry
But I can't remember if we said goodbye",Goodbye,2005
Anders Jormin,"Isn't it rich?
Are we a pair?
Me here at last on the ground,
you in mid-air.
Where are the clowns?

Isn't it bliss?
Don't you approve?
One who keeps tearing around,
one who can't move.
Where are the clowns?
There ought to be clowns.

Just when I'd stopped
opening doors,
finally knowing 
the one that I wanted was yours,
Making my entrance again,
with my usual flair,
Sure of my lines,
no one is there.

Don't you love farce?
My fault, I fear.
I thought that you'd want what I want 
sorry, my dear.
And where are the clowns?
Quick, send in the clowns.
Don't bother, they're here.

Isn't it rich?
Isn't it queer?
Losing my timing this late
in my career?
And where are the clowns?
There ought to be clowns.
Well, maybe next year",Send in the Clowns,2005
Anders Kjellberg,"Hey you, look what you do to me 
You bend and you bruise me
Why you try to control me?
But you don't know me 
How come you just want to hurt me?
How come you just want to push me?
I can't ignore you anymore 
Cause everywhere I turn you
You burn me, you break me 
You always want to take me down with you
What do you want from me?

I don't wanna be afraid, I don't wanna run away 
I don't want to be evaded it's more that I can take 
I'm never gonna be the same 
I threw it all away
I don't want to be evaded
Just let go! (look what you do to me) 
Let go! (look what you do to me)

Hey you, look what you do to me 
You burnt and you scared me
With all that you tell me (but I don't listen!)
You love me, you hate me 
You always want to take me down with you 
What do you want from me?

I don't wanna be afraid I don't wanna run away 
I don't want to be evaded it's more that I can take 
I'm never gonna be the same 
I threw it all away
I don't want to be evaded
Just let

You kept pushing me
You keep using me
You keep twisting me
You keep breaking me
You can't have me anymore [x3]
You can't have me, let go!

I don't wanna be afraid, I don't wanna run away 
I don't want to be evaded it's more that I can take

Anders Kjellberg,"Its not the pale moon that excites me
That thrills and delights me, oh no 
Its just the nearness of you 

It isn't your sweet conversation 
That brings this sensation, oh no 
Its just the nearness of you 

When you're in my arms and I feel you so close to me 
All my wildest dreams come true 

I need no soft lights to enchant me 
If you'll only grant me the right 
To hold you ever so tight 
And to feel in the night the nearness of you",The Nearness of You,1998
Anders Nordgren,"You in brown checked suit
Said my dress was very cute
I found you found me
Dancing in this melody
Heavenly!

We were swinging on so nice
Bubbly pink champagne on ice
Nancy, Jacques Closeau and Claire
I believe they all were there
Having the time of their lives

You had Rose's lime
Mixed with vodka, I had wine
People having fun
Cocktails in the evening sun
Give me one!

We were swinging on so nice

Anders Nordgren,"sick tired and homeless
With no one here to sing for
Tired of being weightless
For all these looking boys

You can always say my attic has its charm
You can always say you did no major harm
You can always that summer had its charm
And that you did no major harm
Oh spare me if you please

Sick tired and sleepless
With no one else to shine for
Sick of all my distress
But I won't show I'm still poor

Symptoms are so deep

Nothing is complete
Nowhere to belong
Symptoms are so deep
I think I'd better stay here on my own
So spare me if you please",Sick and Tired,1995

Anders Osborne,"Half a mile from the county fair
And the rain came pourin' down
Me and Billy standin' there
With a silver half a crown

Hands are full of a fishin' rod
And the tackle on our backs
We just stood there gettin' wet
With our backs against the fence

Oh, the water
Oh, the water
Oh, the water
Hope it don't rain all day

And it stoned me to my soul
Stoned me just like Jelly Roll
And it stoned me
And it stoned me to my soul
Stoned me just like goin' home
And it stoned me

Then the rain let up and the sun came up
And we were gettin' dry
Almost let a pick-up truck nearly pass us by
So we jumped right in and the driver grinned

And he dropped us up the road
Yeah, we looked at the swim and we jumped right in
Not to mention fishing poles

Oh, the water
Oh, the water
Oh, the water
Let it run all over me

And it stoned me to my soul
Stoned me just like Jelly Roll
And it stoned me
And it stoned me to my soul
Stoned me just like goin' home
And it stoned me

On the way back home we sang a song
But our throats were getting dry
Then we saw the man from across the road
With the sunshine in his eyes

Well he lived all alone in his own little home
With a great big gallon jar
There were bottles too, one for me and you
And he said Hey! There you are

Oh, the water
Oh, the water
Oh, the water
Get it myself from the mountain stream

She fell down-down, down, down, down in Holland
Oh yeah, a ha, oh yeah, a ha
Oh yeah, hell in Holland

She had the picture of me as the man
To take her worries away
I tell you I did everything I can
But I had to go my own way

Delusional the blood lost paint his mind in a cave
Feeding monsters in the back of his head

Heaven fire up my blood I'm waiting for something that's better

Saw the angel/devil vanished out in the light
Breathing new air for a day to begin
Soulless body with an empty shell

Until I'm almost mad
I must have 'roused the devil's wrath

I guess I'll go through life 
Just catchin' colds and missin' trains

I never miss a thing
I've had the measles and the mumps
And every time I play an ace
My partner always trumps
Guess I'm just a fool who never looks before he jumps

At first my heart thought you could break this jinx for me
That love would turn the trick to end despair

I've telegraphed and phoned

Anderson,"There was a man like you and me, as simple as a man could ever be;
And he was happy as a king, except for one peculiar thing.

He had a clock that worked all right, 
It worked all right, but not exactly quite;
Instead of going ""tick, tock, tick"", 
the crazy clock went ""tock, tick, tock"".

The poor old man just raved and raved, because nobody could say
Why his silly clock behaved that hickory dickory way.
But now a famous man is he, He owns a public curiosity;
From far and wide the people flock To hear the syncopated clock.

Tick-a-tock, tick-a-tock,
There's a zing in the swing of that clock,
Tock-a-tick, tock-a-tick, 
Don't you think it's a marvelous trick?

Ting-a-ling, ting-a-ling,
There's a zong in the bong of that ring,
Ling-a-ting, ling-a-ting, 
Don't you think it's a wonderful thing?

The experts came to hear and see,
But none of them could solve the mystery.
They called Professor Einstein too,
He said ""There's nothing I can do"".

But soon the fickle human race will find another freak to take its place,
And one fine day the man will hock the poor old syncopated clock.",The Syncopated Clock,1989

Jump out this next world
Is gone overground
That sky is ecstasy dancin'
My child my woman
My daughter my son
Together planning to party
Just wait for me
Out in the street
Teakbois in everywhere
Dancing with you
We're coming through
Somehow we'll all be there
This time is surely
Come once and for all
We've waited so now
We are ready
Be quick be ready
Be sure and be smart
No need the energy wasted
I've dreamed of music
That comes from the heart
As tho' the eagle has landed
Just wait for me
Out in the street
Teakbois is everywhere
Dancing with you
We're coming through
Everyone will be there
She smiles my mind
Is just blown I can't stop
No time is better than now
I wake up everyday
Before the sun is coming up

The fish to catch
The sea to swim
They say I gotta life
To live
Bobby Dread and the cool running
My music is my only witness
To my very soul
Bobby Dread and the cool running
So when you need me
All you have to do is help me
Lose control
Bobby Dread and the cool running
They say the world's a stage
So let me play for you and you and you
Bobby Dread and the cool running
It's all I ever in my life
I really wanted
To sing and do
Bobby Dread and the cool running
We form a group a simple name
A secret harmony like
Bobby Dread and the cool running
We write our songs
We symphonise
Some people say they like us

Anderson Bruford Wakeman Howe,"In 1954 the British Government, 
In order to maintain the balance
Of power between East and West, 
exploded their first atom bomb at Woomera. 
They failed to contact all of the Aborigine peoples 
atthe time. The Aborigines still call this 
'The day of the cloud.'

Dreaming by the sky
The scent of colours
In the flowers

To England they are tied
They were blasted by the Silver Cloud
There were blasted to the wall alive

Counting out the statesmen
Bungling one by one
Spelling out this segregation
So the catchword be
Looking after number one
They release the fear inside
Are human after all
So begins our dream time
They hunted like the dinosaur
We the pure
They the savage innocent
How we crush our existence after all
Come on

For without them
We are lonely
This England we are blind
Like all the Empires crumble
Will surely change the tide

This place ain't big enough for red and white
This place ain't big enough for stars and stripes

This place, this place
This place is theirs, by their birthright

United we are blind
To deliver our existence
Keep it up
Keep it up

Hold the key

Anderson Paak,"It's the American dream
But if you pull on the thread, it's gonna tear at the seam
See what I mean? We don't tend to scream
Baby, we just stare at the screen
Like it's a preacherman up at the pulpit
Some with the scars end up holding the bullwhip
Another angry kid unloading a full clip
And I could tie a pretty bow on this bullshit
But let's not lie for another second
We see the trouble, we're rubberneckin
No doublecheckin, if it's an issue we have to grapple
The words are caught in my Adam's apple
I make my body a happy chapel
'Cause every person's a tabernacle
But there's no feeling you gotta hide
So let's all pray to the God inside, say it now

Never needed a hand til you needed a hand
You never know how to walk until you understand
Coulda been anything that you needed to be
How many more do you want? How many more do you need?
Still I wish I could break free
It’s that same old simple song I still believe
How many more do we need?
Before it’s hand over hand
Love over everything

That’s me with the long arm
Screaming at the top dog, spilling my blood on the cement
We willing to roll now, sick of getting mowed down
Fuck if I dope now, it’d kill me
'Cause I’d rather be known for the dealing
Than known to be hooked on the feeling
How many more gotta go now? How many more gotta go down?
I’ll stand in the rain witcha
Just to get a little bit of glimpse of the plain picture
People need a pinch just to get em to wake up
You’ll be in a ditch before I get you to wake up, say it bruh
Whoever said it wasn’t fair, they was telling the truth
I’d be a liar if I said there was nothing to prove

Never needed a hand til you needed a hand
You never know how to walk until you understand
Coulda been anything that you needed to be
How many more do you want? How many more do you need?
Still I wish I could break free
It’s that same old simple song I still believe
How many more do we need?
Before it’s hand over hand
Love over everything

They say we gotta know our role
Kiss the bottom of the totem pole
Set goals, and then go for gold
But we hibernate and hide inside our gopher holes
I wanna smoke a bowl, a hand on my dick
While the other one is busy clicking the remote control
I'm no Dalai Lama of the sofa but I hear I gotta go to
Where the sinners face the roasting coals
You say that your heart ain't got no holes, well bitch please
Let's all admit that we got souls like Swiss cheese
But wishing isn't gonna fill this abyss
And no hand over hand over fisted riches is fixin what's missin
If I wanna kill this monotony
I know the answer is a light that I got in me
I got no university degree in philosophy
But I know that every baby's born with the lock and key

Never needed a hand til you needed a hand
You never know how to walk until you understand
Coulda been anything that you needed to be
How many more do you want? How many more do you need?

Everybody gotta order the low-cal or no-cal meal
I don't even enjoy guilt
I think the city turned my semen to soymilk

I'm thinking maybe I will never be Brad Pitt

Are kinda like the season how they come and they go
And we'll be living while they looking for parking
And we'll be digging while they woofing and barking
They kicking in the door and hoping to barge in

Anderson Paak,"Some got hits about the racks that they earn
Say there's Benjamins and Jacksons in their pockets to burn
But when they shoot the video, producers pass around a bucket
Full of rented jewelry for them to rock and return
I know a straight edge rapper who acts like a sheep herder
A vegan on the mic whose screaming that meats murder
But when everybody's sleeping he be creeping
Slugging back the whiskey, hating himself and sneaking a cheeseburger
There's a pop idol at the top of the charts
And when her records being cut she's on the beach in St. Barts
While a session singer who didn't have the face to make it
Signs a nondisclosure agreement and belts out her parts
It's hard cause I got bars that are big uppin' Woody Allen
But maybe he's a predator whose diggin' in his talons
There's a balance and often I don't know how to feel
In a fake and painted world seek the real

Now I can't change the past but a man's gotta man up
It's hard to believe sometimes I get the best of me
Now, I'm doing what I can but I'm a man not a damn chump
I can say it if you need, but I'd rather let the ink bleed

We dismiss our heroes' skeletons no matter how grim
My fans saying ""I'd be honored to be injured by him""
Well fam, this branch is thin, but I'll go out on a limb
To say she didn't love her ulna poking out of her skin
Being pumped full of morphine and tied to machines
They cut off my jeans, I heard her in the ambulance scream
She's in school to do tattoos and might of had nerve damage
So I could have cost a girl a chance at her dream
Meanwhile, he pops painkillers until the dude is numb
Knew I was a stupid ass, just not that I'm a ruthless one
Youth is easily influenced
So should you be rooting for me if I touch a thousand
lives but on the way I ruin some?
The rule of thumb is ""all publicity is your advantage""
But human lives are not collateral damage
Bandage the wounded then vanish blank as the newest of canvases
When they zoom in the cameras, give them the truth

Now I can't change the past but a man's gotta man up
It's hard to believe sometimes I get the best of me
Now, I'm doing what I can but I'm a man not a damn chump
I can say it if you need, but I'd rather let the ink bleed

Mega church leaders sleeping with male hookers
Mayors hitting crack pipes with their cookers
Each week a crooked politician gets caught
We're not shocked when they're cheaters
These days we're shocked when they're not
Are they the person you thought?
If they're perfect and hot
Often we blame the victim scoff and they deserve what they got
Actors sweep it under the rug and resume with the plot
But they're amateurs and we can see the boom in the shot
If perception is reality then this could be a shocker
I've done my share of fucked up things that didn't get on Gawker
Lots of tiny indiscretions way beyond the public eye
That if you saw would probably out me as a complicated guy
Mike says you got to separate the person from the art
But if the arts about that person you can't pull them apart

Motherfucker know I started from the bottom, vodka baby bottle
Mixin' up with Similac, my momma knew I had a problem
Wasn't thinking about no rapping, I was drinking for a dollar
Putting quarter pieces in the black Caprice and make it holla
No releasing me, I got the beast in me
I gotta holla, keep the decency and make them TNT my product
I'm a C-O-M-P-T-O-innovator, energizer

All I care about is wearing out your area
And airing out your upper body

Probably got fucked up tryna park his tour bus
Not knowing what's what
Or who's who, living in the L.A county zoo
Pick them off like a big dog, motherfucker, woof
Once upon a time, I shot a nigga on accident (boom, boom, boom)
I tried to kill him but I guess I needed more practicing (boom, boom, boom)
That's when I realized, banging wasn't for everybody
Switch it up before my enemy or the sheriff got me
They liable to bury him, they nominated six to carry him
They worry him to death, but he's no vegetarian

I was this good, scoffed, I just shook off
Probably reminded you of the first time you saw Tiger Woods golf
Never thought about how much my race and nationality meant

Decided opposing you is what I'm ‘posed to do alls

You felt my pain, it's almost like I poked voodoo dolls
And I hope my spirit haunts the studios when I'm gone
My picture jumps off a poster and just floats through the halls
And fucking goes through the walls like the ghost of Lou Rawls

And I can do anything but move backwards
The hardest thing is to keep from being distracted
My big sister still cling to me on the taxes
Tell Uncle Sam I just need a second to add this
Gave my momma ten racks
And she packed and went to Chumash with it
Could triple the worth and give me half of it
Half of it I took in the back of the air mattress
A quarter stash was stashed in a box with the Air Maxs'
The rest got lost in Saks with my wifey, no BM
Wack niggas dropping links in my DM
Bad bitches up and down a nigga TM
I'm glad that you finally made it to the future but you're late
And the price is through the muthafuckin' roof
If you want you could wait outside the building
I ain't takin' no more meetings

Stepped in the waters
The water was cold
Chi in my body
But not in my soul

I bring you greetings from the first church of Goon Baptists
United Fellowship of Free Nationals
Residing pastor is thy .Paak
And the first lady is a bad bitch
With slanted eyelids and sick hashish
Sunglasses, Martin Luther King fan for you bitch niggas
Sweating on my Patent Leathers
Pressure turned their feather weight into a Cinderella
I ain't seen the ground in days since I grew propellers
We'll do one better
Word to the liquor that killed my grandpa liver
I know you finally look proud, a nigga smiling
To every hundred niggas that came and gone missing
Only a handful will go the distance
I swear I seen this shit coming as if I was living up under the plumbing
While niggas was riffing and mumbling 'bout, what they could do
I was cooking gumbo whipping the voodoo
I was in the jungle running with Zulu's
We was looking past the struggle while life was moving so fast
You had to be shopping at Ginsu
To the top of the food group
Doing what I want and how I should too

We was goin' in to get away
Sick of feelin' so outta place
Wishin' I could save ya, what was I to say?
Wishin' I could save ya, but now it's too late
Now, is this really what I wanted?
Is it really worth the pain?
Now am I really an asshole? Fuck what you say
Don't do me no favors, let's get back to basics
We live for today, bitch, look up out my way, bitch
I'm losin' all my aces, I'm runnin' outta patience
Got some pretty faces knowin' what my name is
Up in high places, I got some new neighbors
They don't really say shit but when they see the spaceship
They just think I ride with some form of entertainment
But they don't know I'm black, young, gifted and amazin'

You know I had to close my eyes, yeah
And if I have to free my mind
I may not have the lane, movin' all along
Knowin' that I can't do it on my own
And if I got the pain feelin' comin' out
Have to run away, think I'm goin' home

You know I'm workin' on a world premiere
And I could see the world from here
I know you somewhere in the atmosphere
I know someday I'll meet you halfway there (Cheers)
They say there's nothin' you can do about it
Can't say that I'm new to sorrow
Wishin' I could take your problems trade 'em for a little more time wit'chu
Carry you out the bottom, the weight of the world, I got it
Sprouted wit'chu on my shoulder, the greatest honor to know ya
I'd gotta be honest wit'cha, I hate you ain't in the picture
I hate all them fake niggas claimin' like they gon' really miss ya
I know there's no one to blame and maybe the point that I'm missin'
But I needed a minute, just give me a minute

You know I had to close my eyes, yeah
And if I have to free my mind
I may not have the lane, movin' all along
Knowin' that I can't do it on my own
And if I got the pain feelin' comin' out
Have to run away, think I'm goin' home

Oh, say it ain't so!
Tears keep fallin' down my eyes
Damn it, I miss you, I should be with you
Can't turn back the hands of time but I should be with you
I miss my friend
Damn it, I miss you
Can't bring you back

These pictures I'm seein' are fuckin' me up
And I don't know what to do but reminisce and face the pain
Back in the day before you were a dog and you were just pup
Bangin' beats and bringin' bitches back to the tour bus
Excuse me, y'all, I know this .Paak shit, I just need a second
It's Q-Tip in this bitch and I'm just in here reflectin'
Head on collisions with memories in the intersection
Lookin' in my rearview, wishin' I could be near you
The freeways of my mind are crowded with traffic
The good times that we had and them bad habits
Look at me now, look around, last man standin'
Grown man cryin' like a child tryna understand it
So sick of sendin' flowers to all my of brother's mommas
Don't know what's harder, fightin' trauma or keepin' a promise
A true confession breath is a blessin', without a question
But niggas don't get the message until they get disconnected
My story ain't over, I'm still turnin' pages
But the picture I painted with you in it has faded
My queen, my dreams and even my wages
I know what it means to lose everything when you made it
Rags to the riches and back to the rags is muhfucka
The consequence of puttin' all your chips in one bucket
To be honest, I feel like gettin' right back to these commas
You motherfuckers keep the drama

I'm workin' on a world premiere
And I could see the world from here
I know there must be somethin' after here
I know some day I'll meet ya halfway there in the atmosphere
Cheers

Free my mind
You know I had to close my eyes
Close my eyes
And now I have to free my mind
Oh
You know I had to close my eyes
You know it's time for me
And now I have to free my mind

Free, free, free my mind, my mind, my mind",Cheers,2018

Said I gotta do something
About where we're going

Step on a steam train
Step out of the driving rain, maybe
Run from the darkness in the night
Singing ha, ah la la la de day
Ah da da da de day
Ah la la de day

Sweet the sin
Bitter than taste in my mouth
I see seven towers
But I only see one way out

You got to cry without weeping
Talk without speaking
Scream without raising your voice

You know I took the poison
From the poison stream
Then I floated out of here
Singing ha la la la de day
Ha la la la de day
Ha la la de day

She runs through the streets
With eyes painted red
Under a black belly of cloud in the rain
In through a doorway she brings me
White gold and pearls stolen from the sea
She is raging
She is raging
And the storm blows up in her eyes
She will

Suffer the needle chill
She's running to stand

Andra Day,"Sleigh bells ring are you listening?
In the land snow is glistening
A beautiful sight, we're happy tonight
Walking in a winter wonderland

Gone away is the bluebird
Here to stay is a new bird
And he sings a love song as we go along
Walking in a winter wonderland

In the meadow we can build a snowman
Then pretend that he is Parson Brown
He'll say, ""Are you married?"" We'll say, ""No man""
But you can do the job when you're in town

Later on we'll conspire
As we dream by the fire
To face unafraid of the plans that we made
Walking in a winter wonderland

In the meadow we can build a snowman
And pretend that he's a circus clown
We'll have lots of fun with Mr. Snowman
Until the other kiddies knock him down

When it snows ain't it thrilling?
Though your nose gets a chilling
We'll frolic and play the Eskimo way, way, way

Playing with bombs like kids play with toys
One warm December our hearts will see
A world where men are free

Someday at Christmas there'll be no wars
When we have learned what Christmas is for
When we have found what life's really worth
There'll be peace on earth

Someday all our dreams will come to be
Someday in a world where men are free
Maybe not in time for you and me
But someday at Christmastime

Someday at Christmas we'll see a Man
No hungry children, no empty hand
One happy morning people will share
Our world where people care

Someday at Christmas there'll be no tears
All men are equal and no men have fears
One shinning moment my heart ran away
From our world today

Someday all our dreams will come to be
Someday in a world where men are free
Maybe not in time for you and me
But someday at Christmastime

Someday a new world that we can start

Andra Day,"I saved every letter you wrote me
From the moment I read them
I knew you were mine, said you were mine
I thought you were mine

Do you know what Angelica said
When we saw your first letter arrive?
She said, ""Be careful with that one, love
He will do what it takes to survive""

You and your words flooded my senses
Your sentences left me defenseless
You built me palaces out of paragraphs
You built cathedrals

I'm re-reading the letters you wrote me
I'm searching and scanning for answers
In every line, for some kind of sign
And when you were mine
The world seemed to

Burn
Burn

You published the letters she wrote you
You told the whole world how you brought
This girl into our bed
In clearing your name, you have ruined our lives

Do you know what Angelica said
When she read what you'd done?
She said, ""You have married an Icarus
He has flown too close to the sun""

You and your words, obsessed with your legacy
Your sentences border on senseless
And you are paranoid in every paragraph
How they perceive you
You, you, you

I'm erasing myself from this narrative
Let future historians wonder how Eliza
Reacted when you broke her heart
You have torn it all apart
I'm watching it

Burn
Watching it burn

The world has no right to my heart
The world has no place in our bed
They don't get to know what I said
I'm burning the memories
Burning the letters that might have redeemed you

You forfeit all rights to my heart
You forfeit the place in our bed
You sleep in your office instead
With only the memories
Of when you were mine

I hope that you burn, burn",Burn,2016
Andra Day,"If you could look inside my life
And use my eyes, would you pity me?
Would you see the desperate nights
And all the lies that brought me to my knees
I keep thinking that I have to make you fall
The way I fell from your betrayal to bring me peace of mind
I won't let you move along, just walk away
And wear a cape like you're some hero

I can't hear love 'cause we're at war

(I can't hear love 'cause we're at war)
But revenge is so loud and the drums are so proud
But I'm still in a cage and I hear mercy say now
It's the only way out

I used to hear my father say, ""Counterplay ends in defeat""
And I said I'd never be that way
Tried to make you pay 'cause it would cost me
But you owe me so much more than what you gave to this
I guess every story twists
People tell me let it go, oh, and forget

I can't hear love 'cause we're at war

All the possessions anyone can ever have
But it's all worthless treasure, true worth is only measured
Not by what you got, but what you got in your heart
You can have, you can have everything
What does it, what does it mean?

It all means nothing

Then you can look in the mirror
Proud of who's looking back at you
Define the life you're living
Not by what you take or what you're givin'
And if you bet on love there's no way you'll ever lose
Take a stand, make a stand for what's right
It's always worth, always worth the fight

It all means nothing
If you don't stand up for something
You can't just talk the talk
You got to walk that walk, yes you do
It all means nothing
If you don't stand up for something
And I stand up for you
Stand for respect, dignity
If that's all you got, then you got all you need
And without that, you don't have a thing, oh, no, no

Rise up, love, lift your hands
I stand with you 'cause I understand
Ain't here to judge, just to take a stand
The greater plan's the Creator's plan
Let's all rise like the day began
Reach out and touch with the Savior's hand
On rock, we stand like this native land
Let the ways of love be the ways of man

Caught in the system

By any means they got to earn
Who am I to knock 'em
If they cover their faces stocking
Run up in the spots and let the glock kick

Young, ruthless, and carefree

Shifted, my way of thinking

Better fresher in white leather

Flashing high-priced threads
Matching the foreign cars in the driveway
Living that wealth forever

Gonna make a difference

My favorite winter coat
This wind is blowing my mind
I see the kids in the streets
With not enough to eat
Who am I to be blind?
Pretending not to see their needs

A summer disregard, a broken bottle top
And a one man soul

Take a look at yourself, and then make a change

I've been a victim of a selfish kind of love
It's time that I realize
That there are some with no home, not a nickel to loan
Could it be really me, pretending that they're not alone?

And a washed-out dream
They follow the pattern of the wind ya' see

André 3000,"It's like I told you, I'm getting away from this town
I'll be traveling alone, adventure is calling my name
And if you want to, you can follow me
I'm gonna go to the jungle and build me a home

We could live right (in the jungle baby)
Stay up all night (all night)
Kiss by moonlight (and you could kiss me)
It would be tight

We'll have a family and I will protect you from harm
We could get wilder than all the animals
And I will try to keep it simple if that's what you want
I know you're scared baby, I know you're proud
I know your girl, she was fooling around
She had your head under water your heart under fire
And I've decided she didn't know how to love you

We could live right (we could live right)
Stay up all night (stay up all night)
Kiss by moonlight (you can kiss me)
It would be tight (it would be so right)
We could get by (we could get by)
Start a new life (start a new life)
Dance with fireflies (in the jungle baby)
We could get by (in the jungle baby)

Can't hide from the man in the moon, he's watching
Make love like animals (baby), I'm feeling cannibal
And I'll eat you alive.

Jungle, in the jungleâ?¦

We could live right (we could live right)
Stay up all night (stay up all night)
Kiss by moonlight (you can kiss me)
It would be tight (it would be so right)
We could get by (we could get by)
Start a new life (start a new life)
Dance with fireflies (in the jungle baby)
We could get by (in the jungle baby)

We could live right (oh my precious little boy)
Stay up all night (just rest your weary head)
Kiss by moonlight (it's gonna be all right)
It would be tight
We could get by (hush now my precious little boy)
Start a new life (and rest your weary head)
Dance with fireflies (it's gonna be all right)
We could get by",Junglebook,2005
André 3000,"Chronomentrophobia
The fear of clocks
The fear of time

High as the cost of living
I take what I've been given
Pastor say ""be strong""
Ooh hey hey
I ain't got time leave me alone

I ain't got much time left
I've got to funk you now

[Chorus]
Chronomentrophobia [Repeat: x8]

Lord be having mercy on my soul
I'm having the impression that my life goin' be a bowl
Of cherries but its very hard for me to cope
Got tired of being broke
This ATLien ain't got no time to sit and mope
Made up my mind while y'all made up y'all beds
On a cold wooden floor is where I laid my head
Born in 1975 never thought I'd make it this far
Still battling in this racial war
Trying to find solutions to the situation I'm facing
Only thing that's free is my flow that y'all be chasing
Letting my niggas know before I go I drop that knowledge
Like dropping books lets stop the crooks
From robbing you of your brains and such using welfare as a crutch
I'm in it for good you into my hood you won't be finding much
Hope that when I'm gone y'all remember this
What we stood for ""fuck that fame and that glitz""
It's beginning to look a lot like the ending
And got to be more careful know what corners you be bending
Revelations getting impatient and now I'm dead
Remember what I said I'm gone bow ya heads",Chronomentrophobia,2007
André 3000,"I said, ""What time you get off?""
She said, ""When you get me off""
I kinda laughed but it turned into a cough
'Cause I swallowed down the wrong pipe
Whatever that mean, you know old people say it so it sounds right
So I'm standing there embarrassed, if we were both in Paris
I would have grabbed her by the waist and kissed her, but
We in the middle of whole foods, and those foods
Ain't supposed to beef, but you'd think they hated tofu
Check-in line got rowdy, my vision got cloudy
I started seeing circles like some Audi
Emblem, I'm hearing them say, come on man
Do this own your own time, get the hell on, man
I walked out, hm, I got bout
Half-way to my car when I heard shorty shout
""Three thousand, forgot your credit card, smart move
By the way, my little sister loves your cartoon""
Well, here's my name and numb
If I ain't the one, lose it, if I am, use it
If a man chooses, and he can, do's it
And he don't, don't take it personal, he might be might be swamped
With making mozzarella, no, making worlds better
Cheese will come, believe me, I'm, never focused on the cash
Ask Mel Gibson, Jesus Christ, I'm bout the pass, ion

Stop, baby bring that thang back
You know where my heart at
Shorty, show your boy some love
'Cause I'm about to lose it
With the way you move it
It's been making me do it
Girl tell me what it do
I'll change the game for you
I'm a player, yes it's true, but

Can I be for real?
This is how I feel
I'm in need of love
So let's dip up out of here
Ooh, you just my type
Everything's so right

I'll admit it, this just ain't no game
These just ain't words that I'm spittin'
If you could see the thoughts that's in my head
I'm trippin', I'm a player yea it's true
But I'll change the game for you
I wanna see what it do, ooh

Yeah, Nas be in the crib low, strip pollin' it
Cold Guinness, bitter taste, slim waist, I'm gon' hit it
We low-key baby, like a baritone
Apple computer, e-mail me to come screw ya
Run through ya, undo ya bra, gimme medulla, uh
Ya cute as a movie star, in sin city, Hennessey, my love slave
Lovin' is pimpin', no rest have, with none of 'em
I would leave every one of em, you just say it
Just leave it the way it is, he ain't aware that sleepin' dogs lie
But keep a sharp eye on him, cause I'm the wrong guy
To wanna put this four-five on em, let's get it on, ma
You got my nose wide open
You already locked down and rot down, but so delicious
If he get suspicious, bring up his old mistress
I ain't dry-snitchin', but why should you be feelin' bad
Cause I be killin' that, huh?

Can I be for real?
This is how I feel
I'm in need of love
So let's dip up out of here
Ooh, you're just my type

The funky engine that could
Oooo  oooo yosky, wosky, pisky, wisky
All aboard the Stankonia Express
The underground smell road
Everybody's lookin' for an excuse to let loose
What's your locomotive, the chatta nigga choo choo?

Humble as a mumble in the jungle
Of shouts and screams
That's the way the cracker crumbles
So I guess I've got to re-route my dreams

Humble as a mumble in the jungle
of shouts and screams
That's the way the cracker crumbles
So I guess I've got to re-route my dreams

Back on the microphone, your number one controller
I rock the microphone like a blizzard;
I'm so cold I'm tryin' to hold ya
Life is like a great big roller coaster
Everything in life don't happen like it's suppose to
Trials and tribulations make you stronger live longer
You wanna reach the nation nigga start from ya corner
Everything in life don't always happen like you plan it
Demand it; over stand it then you handle it
Fuck wishing you, you missing the ambition on your mission
Now you switching why you quitting 'cause it's heated in the kitchen
Sloppy slipping in your pimping nigga
You either pistol whoop the nigga or you choke the trigger
You've got to follow through, struggle to complete your dreams

If the dealer dealt a fucked up hand of cards you've gotta play 'em

We chicken nugget, we dip in the sauce like mop and bucket
Blue-collar scholars, who'll take your dollar and wipe my ass wit it
You livin for the lotto never hit it
I met a critic, I made her shit her drawers
She said she thought hip-hop was only guns and alcohol
I said ""Oh hell naw!""  But yet it's that too
You can't discrimi-hate cause you done read a book or two
What if I looked at you in a microscope, saw all the dirty organisms
Living in your closet would I stop and would I pause it?  Whoo!
To put that bitch in slower motion, got the potion and the antidote
And a quote for collision the decision.. is,
Do you want to live or wanna exist?
The game changes everyday so obsolete is the fist and marches
Speeches only reaches those who already know about it
This is how we go about it

So I guess I've got to re-route my dreams

Humble as a mumble in the jungle
Of shouts and screams
That's the way the cracker crumbles
So I guess I've got to re-route my dreams

I'm wild just like a rock, a stone, a tree
And I'm free, just like the wind the breeze that blows
And I flow, just like a brook, a stream, the rain
And I fly, just like a bird up in the sky
And I'll surely die, just like a flower plucked
And dragged away and thrown away
And then 1 day it turns to clay
It blows away, it finds a ray, it finds its way
And there it lays until the rain and sun
Then I breathe, just like the wind the breeze that blows
And I grow, just like a baby breastfeeding
And it's beautiful, that's life and that's life
And that's life and that's life

Humble as a mumble in the jungle
Of shouts and screams
That's the way the cracker crumbles
So I guess I've got to re-route my dreams

And there's a, and there's a fine, line 
Too late to pray that I'm on it

Y'all, uh huh, y'all 

There's a fine line between love and hate you see 
Came way too late  but baby I'm on it,
And there's a fine line between love and hate you see 
Can't wait too late  but baby I'm on it.

That's Liberation and baby I want it,
Can't worry bout, what another nigga think 
Now that's Liberation and baby I want it

(Let me hear it, let me hear it, let me hear those, let me hear those) 
Many times I sit back and contemplate 
I'm fresh off the dank, but I'm telling my story,
My relationship, with my folks is give and take 
And I done took so much, now gimme my glory 
To have a choice to be who you wants to be 
It's left up to me, and my momma and 'em told me (yes she did) 
I say to have a choice to be who you wants to be 
Is left up to me, and my momma nem told me 

No, no, no
I'm so tired, it's been so long, struggling, hopelessly 
Seven and forty days, hey
Oh, I sacrifice every breath I breathe 
To make you believe, I'd give my life away
Oh lord, I'm so tired, I'm so tired 
My feet feel like I walked most of the road on my own 
All on my own, we,
We alive but we ain't living, that's why I'm giving until it's gone 
Cause I don't want to be alone (I don't want to be alone) 
I don't want to be alone, yeah
Is there anything I can say to help you find your way 
Touch ya soul, make ya whole, the same for you and I 
There's not a minute that goes by that I don't believe 
We can fly.. but I can feel it in the wind 
The beginning or the end

Shake that load off, shake that load off [Repeat: x16]

Folk in your face, you're a superstar 
Niggas hang around cause of who you are 
You get a lot of love cause of what you got 
Say they happy for you but they really not 
Sell a lot a' records and you roll a Benz 
Fall up in the spot now you losing friends 
All ya want to do is give the world ya heart 
Record label trying to make you compromise ya art 
You make a million dollars, make a million mo' 
First class broads treat ya like a nigga po 
You want to say ""Wait!"" but you're scared to ask 
Ya world starts spinning and it's moving fast 
Ya try to stay sane that's the price of fame 
Spending your life trying to numb the pain 
Ya shake that load off and sing ya song 
Liberate the minds, then you go on home...

I must admit, they planted a lot of things 
In the brains and the veins of my strain 
Makes it hard to refrain, from the host of cocaine 
From them whores, from the flame 
From a post in the game 
Makes it hard to maintain focus 
Then from the glock rounds and lockdowns and burials 
The seeds that sow, get devoured by the same locusts 
Cause it's a hard row to hoe 
If your ass don't move, and the rain don't fall 
And the ground is dry 
But the roots are strong, so some survive 
To your surprise, no one voived their cries 
You got more juice than Zeus 
Slanging lightning trying to frighten 
Plains dwellers, of the Serengeti 
But get beheaded when you falsely dreaded 
Melanin silicon and collagen injected 
Dissecting my pride, fool I don't want to get it started 
We be the lionhearted, without a fantasy 
It's like that red sprite, you can't imagine it 
Unless you looking at the canvas of life 
And not through the peephole of mortality 
Single minded mentality 
Getting over on loopholes 
Getting paid two-fold on technicalities 
Clicking your heels, scared to bust how you feel 
Pack the steel 
Picking cotton from the killing fields with no Toto 
I don't we in Kansas no mo' though 
Midwest or Dirty South 
Clean dressed or dirty mouth 
Whether robbing preachers or killing Poor Righteous Teachers 
You a scared demon 
Shouldn't be allowed to spread semen 
And your cowardly lies never defying the jackals of babble 
Running with they pack, tail between your legs 
Though the man on your head say the story 
As you downplay your glory 
Cackling, helping the shackling of your brethren happen 
Just by rapping

The Love Below?

She stays alone, never sheds a single tear
She stays in the coolest moods, clearly woman of the year
She and all her girlfriends, they go out dressed to win
She comes back to the cooler side of town
But she lives in my lap

She lives in my lap
Forever my fiance
She lives in my lap
Don't leave, don't stay
She lives in my lap
I'll get the courage one day

Make me want you, make me miss you
Make me wonder where you are, then forget you
Girl remind me, just who we are
We're oh so close, but yet so far

Baby why are you acting like this?
I don't care about any of them
I care about you!
Baby I love you!

You've got me open wide (I love you)
Just Come inside (baby)
It's yours (it's yours)
I'm yours (I'm yours)
For sure (for sure)

Drankin' but we concentratin', smoke another sweet again
Steadily rewindin', trying to make some hot shit
Oh, what a job this is

Another all-nighter, tryin' to get it done
Barely make it home with the morning sun
Baby mother thinking that you on some other shit
Oh, what a job this is

Drankin' yet I'm thinking of another rhyme
Smokin', hoping that some bad news will come some other time
'Cause I'm trying to do what I've loved, I love what I do
This music is something more different than the weed and the brew

That's why we mashin', we ain't asking for nothing, we working for it
Push it, peddled it to the people, they can't ignore it, this is for
All the independents, a few major labels
The big studios who still give niggas favors

On the mixin' and mastering, puzzlin' and
Plastering the tracks together on tapes, C-D's, wax or whatever
This is for all the engineers who smoke weed
Can't forget about the production cost and all the hidden fees

For another rhyme written, we spend time spittin' in the booth
Sometimes it's like a pigeon coop
But it's all for the cause, yeah, so I'm
Gonna continue to MC and smoke weed, you know I'm

Barely make it home with the morning sun
Baby mother thinking that you on some other shit
Oh, what a job this is

As easy as it looks to you, I make it look so easy
With the music I'd be making big impression I'd be leaving
And a lot of folks, they stop and stare thinking I'ma trickin' off
I roll another bleezy, puff it, pass it and shake it off

Move on to the next phase and it's amazing
The next generation of rappers, big Snoop Dogg raising
Hmm, that's 15 years in the game
Still got the fortune and fame, yeah, I'm doing my thang

Check this Devin, somebody said that real Gs to go heaven
So I'ma keep spittin' the truth on these fools like a reverend
Stay open like 7/11 that's 24/7, when you need some hot shit
Stop by and get you a beverage, I'm servin'

My rhymes like nickels and dimes
Plug it in, let it play and let me blow your mind
It's the dominant conglomerate, prominent and I'ma get
What I gotta get, twist another sweet and bob to the beat

Oh, what a job this is

We work nights, we some vampires
Niggas gather 'round their beat like a campfire
Singin' folk songs but not no kumbaya, my Lord
You download it for free, we get charged back for it

I know you're saying, they won't know they won't miss it
Besides, I ain't a thief, they won't pay me a visit
So if I come to your job, take your corn on the cob
And take a couple kernels off it, that would be alright with you

Hell no, yeah, exactamundo
But we just keep recording and it ain't to get no condo
And candy, Bentley, Fanny with no panties in Miami
And that cute lil' chick named Tammy that you took to the Grammys

See we do it for that boy that graduated
That looked you in your eyes real tough and said 'preciate it
And that he wouldn't have made it if it wasn't for your CD number 9
And he's standing with his baby momma Kiki and she cryin'

Talkin' 'bout that they used to get high to me in high school
And they used to make love to me in college
Then they told me 'bout their first date listenin' to my tunes
And how he liked her finger nail polish

I say, hate to cut you off but I gotta go
I wish you could tell me mo' but I'm off to the studio, gotta write tonight
Hey, can you put us in your raps? I don't see why not

Yeah, this life we live, what a job this is, real spit man
A lot of folks want to walk in these shoes but
They just don't know man, it's a hell of a job, man
To be a rapper, MC, whatever you want to call it, man

We got a lot to deal with, family members
We gotta always look out for baby momma nagging
You know I'm saying kids need this and then again
The public need that, we gotta make hot music

With the AK-cuatro siete over microphone in hand
Goddamn. Generation uno, Dungeon Fam
The lab is filled with potions of emotions out the ass
I laugh when you think that you have seen the last
But it's only the beginning my nigga don't be so fast
Pass gas, slow it down to a screeching halt
Impeach the President 'cause he don't think before he talk
Iraq, goddamn, now he gunning for Iran
North Korea got that shit that make LA look like Japan
Our land, nah man, more like the Caribbean
Billy Ocean bodies floating, take a voyage to Atlantis

They selling glass and blasting, machinery sling past
Next stop, Bowling Green, bling flashing
Glow my ass off, Po-Po they try to harass
My dough, ching cash, and I sit in my castle bent
You know the W that come from Dirty Bast
Bird baths, let 'em stunt, we got burners and gats
Fly past, buy NASA, caught up with the cash
Why blast when you know we in your crib? Bypass
I mastered what? The treasurer of getting ass
Whip assing, red pipe and leather, slick nasty
Sassy, but at the same time raspy
Plug me a thug, your mother eating plaster

Styles will change. They say change is dang-erous
As a King standing on the terrace
While his partner pointing up at the riflemen
Coward shooter, never know when your life will end
Then live like there ain't no 'morrow
And if one come then this the motto
Now I put message in bottle
You go to the nearest beach and open your car door
And walk to the place where the sea meets the land
Yeah, it's easier to run the street than walk in the sand
Hey, I'm talking young man. As if chalk in my hand
I will take y'all little ass to school
It's cool when the kids call me Sunny, the hood calls me Stacks
The B's call me honey, Hollywood calls me back
Crack and I have a lot in common
We both come up in the 80's and we keep that bass pumping
That's a nega-tive comparison, embarrassing
Unfortunate that if you come up fortunate the streets consider you lame
Ha, I thought the name of the game was to have a better life
I guess it ain't, what a shame
I don't slang. Never slung but I'm one with the slum
That has a name well fitting, plenty cheese getting
No wonder why they call it the trap, so watch your tail
And I'm not kidding, the rats and mice would give advice
They say, ""you can paint and draw, get out of here
Go show them that we're more than slanging raw.""
That's when I broke into my Big Rube impression
And I tried to enlighten but that night I learned a lesson
That the morals that you think you got go out the window
When all the other kids are fresh and they got new Nintendo Wiis
And your child is down on her knees praying hard up to God
For a Whopper with cheese
Do you B) hit the street hard with a flair
Or do you A) go to school for heating and air?
Dare make an honest living or make a crooked killing
Or do a bit of both until you're holding on a million?
Brilliant. You got one foot in, one foot out
You put your left foot back in and then you shake it all about

I'm so hot still
Better broad, better automobile
Bet a yard, nah, bet a hundred mill
Then by the songs end, I probably start another trend
I know everything you wan do
I did all that by the age of twenty-one
By twenty-two I had that brand new Ack Coupe
I guess you can say that my legend just begun
I'm young enough to know the right car to buy 
Yet grown enough not to put rims on it
I got that six-deuce with curtains so you can't see me 
And I didn't even have to put tints on it
I don't got the bright watch, I got the right watch
I don't buy out the bar, I bought the night spot
I got the right stock
I got stockbrokers that's movin' it like white tops

Call diapers, I might just be gettin' nicer

I use to carry knots like that (like that)

I got the fully in the tux

To hire a gun army, get you spun like laundry
And I'll be somewhere under palm trees calmly

No longer wit' us, fire your babysitters
You lil' fucks fall back for real

And all I got in return was a darn country song
This whole country wrong,
Oh, but you right, if you just put a little ice on,
And cut your mic on
But you don't even write songs
But Hollywood make you spit like a python, I meant Cobra.

And did you know I'm the creator of the term?

She ain't no junkie neither
I ain't no dope dealer
But she keep coming back 
Three stacks must be some crack
Put that pipe in her lap 
She ain't know how to act

Divided attention I'm
Gonna say this and run 
Under condition one
Promise me you gon' stack 
Promise me you gon' ball
Promise me you'll invest

We'll miss her we ain't gon' fake it

Take you there

We walked a thin line
Others say they got you 
But you been mine
As I sit back and watch all them cat fights

But you love the dog
Gave me the spotlight
And now I'm growing up 
Showing up 
Blowing up
I never ever thought that we would separate at all
But you played me 
Like a game of football
Used to feed me 
Need me 
Dress me
Now it's so messy 
Straight cut out and left me

All the fresh styles always start off as a good little hood thing.
Look at blues, rock, jazz, rap
Not even talking about music
Everything else too.
By the time it reach Hollywood it's over.
But it's cool.
We just keep it going and make new shit.

Take our name
Give us a little fame
And then they kick us to the curb

Do I have a girlfriend, technically no.

And she in love with my stick, she say I work it like magic
Okay no need to panic, I’m on a beach where the sand is
Somewhere smokin’ on medication, no I wont need a bandage
Some would look at my age and try to say I’m young and I’m handsome
I say I’m filthy fucking rich, so I’m an old dirty bastard
And my cribs a disaster and my kush is the master
I was in my yellow car but my Ferrari go faster
Sounding like a band in it and my diamonds the dancers
On the remix with Kesha, bout to go see the cashier
On the grind so now my watch has got a lot of diamonds in it

Yeah, Your pussy done changed
It ain't the same girl and that's a shame

When I couldn’t afford a Ford
Clean sox scootin’ across the floor in your grandmama house
Hand on your mouth
You yap too much about the Penny-Ante
This mechanic’s so uncanny, X-men, X-men
Your ex boyfriend should thank me that I took you off his hands
Know I can bring another beach to the sand
And know I am well aware that you can bring a man to his knees
and get what you need without saying please
But can you bring a man to his feet when defeat is on repeat
And they put this man’s Grammy’s on the street?
What? Why so quiet?
Hate that all of our memories happened in a Hyatt?
You were perfect before you went on a diet
You was way thicker, you think I don’t remember
Shit, the magazine got to your head
Now somebody you don’t even know got you in bed
Betcha buddy don't even know you don’t like red
Or was it fuchsia, fuck it, Our future is dead.

Lean you to ya side yeah and ask ya who’s ya daddy now
Ain't even gotta open your eyes, know what your looking at
And I ain't even have to open my eyes when I was cooking that

Now she's my ride or die, it’s us against the world
You know we both hustlin’ so hustlin’ is our world
Said I must've had too much to drink I’m in my G-Mode
So all the ladies repeat after me cause it’s the G-Code
Promise if I get locked, you’ll come and pay my bond
If you hear some niggas plotting on me, you’ll ring the alarm

But I walk down this aisle faithfully, cut that cake for me
I, Jay-Z, take this unlawful lady to have and to hold
And 'til the task force roll
To hug her every corner 'til I get ash from the cold
Or until I’ve amassed a fortune, too much cash for me to fold
Fold under pressure I would never, ever, ever, ever
Your secrets I treasure, for better or worse
You’ll always be my first love 'til death do us part

Where words tend to get thrown around lightly like like like ""love""
""Friend,"" ""rock star"" and ""So and so’s a genius""
So him vow to never utter him do unless him mean it

So if we ever woop the woop
I want all that bleepty bleep
On this nasty carpet Bixby fresh on one knee
Say I do I do I do I do I do
So we can float up outta here in this hot air balloon
Lets put a baby butterfly up in your lil’ cocoon
And maybe twenty-thirty our baby, she’ll be nerdy make the whole club swoon

We must’ve been here before, it’s still fresh on my mind
You got that shit that somebody would look for but won’t find
You must’ve done this before, this can’t be your first time

Cause to her I’m just a rapper, and soon she’ll have met another
So if tonight’s an accident, tomorrow we’ll recover
And I know I’m not supposed to judge a book by its cover
I don’t wanna be in the blind, but sometimes I Stevie Wonder
About her, and she with it if I’m with it, and I’m with it
I know what makes her smile, but I won’t know what makes her different
Or should I just be realistic? Lipstick on the glass
I know this ain’t your first, but it’s better than your last, Tunechi

You must’ve done this before, this can’t be your first time
We must’ve been here before, it’s still fresh on my mind
You got that shit that somebody would look for but won’t find
You must’ve done this before, this can’t be your first time

Shower her with dollar tips
Shawty went and bought a whip
Guarantee the city remember your whole name
You throw the ho a scholarship
All of them ain't all equipped
And this saddens me, I see the pecking order
Quote-unquote ""bad bitches"" work the whole floor
Those that get laughed at sit off in the corner
Like a lab rat nobody want her
Niggas that are married don't wanna go home
But we look up to them, they wish they were us
They want some new trim
We lust for some trust
Now the both of us are colourblind
Cause the other side looks greener
Which leaves your turf in the Boise state
Can't see her play or the team, 'cuz
Everybody has an addiction, mine happens to be you
And those who say they don't
Souls will later on say to them ""that ain't true""
All of them will have an opinion
But y'all know what you can do with them
But if you unsure, I'll take you on tour
To a place you can stick that in
Well, sitting here sad as hell
Listening to Adele, I feel you baby
Someone like you, more like someone unlike you
Or someone that's familiar maybe
And I can tell that she wants a baby
And I can yell ""Girl, that shit crazy!""
Oh what the hell? Nope, can't be lazy
Please be careful, bitches got the rabies",The Real Her,2011
André 3000,"And the peaches and the mangos
You could sell for me

What do you think my brain is made for
Is it just a container for the mind
This great grey matter

Is she just a container for the child
That soft pink matter
Cotton candy Majin Buu
Close my eyes and fall into you
My god she's giving me pleasure

What if the sky and the stars are for show
And the aliens are watching live
From the purple matter

And we sparred until we both grew tired
Nothing mattered

That would probably intimidate
Any of 'em that were un-southern

Thick girls are made for cuddlin'

André 3000,"When 16 ain't enough

It's funny niggas, it's been on my mind lately
When 16 ain't enough, having a dope beat, dope idea
16 bars ain't enough!
How the fuck can I squeeze my whole life into a 16 bar verse?
You know, so many different levels, when 16 ain't enough, to living your life
Depicting with your wordplay, when 16 ain't enough, exactly what life means to you
16 ain't enough

I know y'all gonna feel me on this one
You gotta feel me on this one

Huh, it's funny how things change, funny how time fly
More than my feet travel, the more that I feel fly
More that I make now, the more that the chicks smile
She call me a local nigga, I opened a Swiss account
Eisenhower status Etta James on the dash
John Coltrane cruising in the Cadillac
Seville, feel my life on the real
We the Last Poets so this is a world premiere
Rolling like Mick Jagger, the women just getting badder
All I see is the money, cream, Eric Clapton
And all I wanted was one 16 ain't enough
Talking that fast money 15 every month
When your people labelled poor, that motivated me more
Everything I ever wore was once worn before
Roll with the punches now it's box office numbers
Dressed like Sammy Davis, steamin' my marijuana
Double MGs, double M fees
We in every hood, nigga, government cheese
Yachts and Yacht Masters, Old Dirty Bastard
Floor seat for the Heat paper that I'm stackin'
Better put away a penny for the rainy days
Pick and roll, give and go, fuck a fade away
Livin' like Scottie Pippen, dribble riddles for vittles
Started off with a scribble, now I'm flowing a river
She say my heart cold I'm naming my son December
Whitney died night before the Grammys, damn, what a memory
Trump Tower and I started with a 10 speed
Born broke had to use a nigga's instincts
Now I get a hundred racks for the 16
Waking up to turkey bacon and my thick queen
Niggas hating, I'm just watchin' on the big screen
3 stacks on the beat and the kicks mean

When 16 ain't enough, you know how sometimes you got so much to say but
When 16 ain't enough, they on they only give you 16, heh
Man it's like I mean I got so much to say ya know
The world has said so much to me, I just wanna give right back to 'em you know
When 16 ain't enough, but I only get 16, that's like a cage you know
When 16 ain't enough, I really can't say what I wanna say, you know it's just a glimpse
That's all, just one uh, one little single glimpse
Just a page
But I guess I'm defeating the purpose of doing all this talking

Summer '88, or was it '89
Or was it winter-time, ah, nevermind
I'm in my room, boomin' drawin' LL Cool J album covers
With crayolas on construction paper
I'm trying to fuck my neighbor, I'm tryna hook my waves up
I'm tryna pull my grades up, to get them saddle lace ups
Before Le marc was Jacob, before them girls wore makeup
Before my voice would break up, before we'd tour them shake clubs
Before my mama wake up, before my palms would cake up
Before they told me they love me and we'll never breakup
Before the time she makes love, to someone that I thought was, my homeboy
But boy was, I wrong now
I don't budge, don't want much, just a roof and porch
And a Porsche, and a horse and unfor-tunately
But of course an assort-ment of tor-ches that scor-ches the skin, when they enter
Intru-ders, whose tutors did a lousy job
How's he god if he let's Lucifer let loose on us
That noose on us won't loosen up but loose enough to juice us up
Make us think we do so much and do it big
Like they don't let us win, I can't pretend
But I admit it, it feel good when the hood pseudo-celebrate
Hence why every time we dine we eat until our belly aches
Then go grab the finest wine and drink it like
We know which grape and which region it came from
As if we can name 'em, hint hint, it ain't um Welch's
Hell just fell three thousand more degrees cooler
Y'all can't measure my worth
But when you try, you'll need a ruler made by all the Greek gods
Because the odds have always been stacked against me when back's against the wall
I feel right at home, y'all sitting right at home
All Kelly green with envy while I'm jelly beans descending
Into the palm of a child, looks up at mama and smiles
With such a devilish grin, Like ""where the hell have you been""
She yelling that selling’s a sin, well so is telling young men
That selling is a sin, if you don’t offer new ways to win
A dolphin gone shake his fin, regardless if he is in
Or out of water, most important thing for him is to swim
And flipper didn’t hold his nose, so why shall I hold my tongue?
I miss the days that O' and Market Hole had scowl on his arm?
And I set off these alarms, when camera’s snap snap snap snap
Return fire, pa-pa-pa, pa, pa-pa, pa, pa, pa
They’ll learn why, near privacy, so essential
They won't make no laws, I break their laws till they see out our window
I take the fall to make them all treat human kind more gentle
Forsake them all, I hate them all, don’t like em don’t pretend to
Yea something tells me, we ain’t in Kansas anymore
All that shit that used to be cool ain’t cool anymore
All the women you been pursuing, now they want more
And they deserve it all, don’t settle for what ain’t yours

When 16 ain't enough, when 16 ain't enough, ooh yeah, oh yeah

When 16 ain't enough, when 16 ain't enough, ooh (When 16 ain't enough) yeah, oh yeah (When 16 ain't enough)

(Break down, break down) Does your mama know you see me, does she know you're freaky?
Does she ever wonder if it's 'bout ya I am speaking?
Do you ever ponder where I'm at when you get sleepy?
How the hell I'm gonna tell the youth don't be me?
Yea, ha ha

(I love it) Does your daddy think you perfect, does he know for certain?
Does he know how you act when you pull back all them curtains?
Do he think I'm 2Pac 'cause I'm black and put them works in?
Does he know his daughter might have caught a real merman yeah?

It's funny because, cause you're a changer
But because we love you, we go that extra mile, break it down for 'em Andre huh,

You see, I went away for a while
She gave my love away
And I really shouldn’t blame her
But now that pussy is a stranger

Baby, something's on my mind I gotta say it
Yeah, Your pussy done changed
It ain't the same girl and that's a shame (A crying shame baby)
Ooh, ain't being funny

(I miss that pussy, that pussy, that pussy, that pussy)
Oh, no (Why you do me like that baby?)
Oh, no
Why is this happening to me? (Oh, no)
She told me that it was my pussy
(I miss that pussy, that pussy, that pussy, that pussy)
Oh, no
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

She, she used to be a really special lady (My everything)
I guess she’s feeling kinda freaky lately
It’s such a shame cause now the pussy’s changed (That pussy changed, yeah)
She used to squeeze me
Grip me tight enough so she can please me
But now-now-now, that pussy changed (Pussy done changed)
It’s such a shame (Pussy done changed), that pussy changed

Oh, no
Where did ya pussy go? (Oh, no)

I’m your number one fan-belt, they are not important
I don’t use a cordless, microphone avoid 'em

Meaning real woman
Others peeled on me
You the primer on the lime bean green box
When I couldn’t afford a Ford
Clean socks scooting 'cross the floor
In your, grandmama house
Hand on your mouth
You yap too much about the Penny-Ante
This mechanic's so uncanny
X-Men, X-Men
Your ex-boyfriend should thank me that I took you off his hands
Know I can bring another beach to the sand
And know I am well aware that you can bring a man to his knees
And get what you need without saying please but
Can you bring a man to his feet when defeat is on repeat
And they gone put this man’s Grammy’s on the street?
What? Why so quiet?
Hate that all of our memories happen in a Hyatt
You were perfect before you went on a diet
You was way thicker
You think I don’t remember
Shit, the magazine got to your head
Now somebody you don’t even know got you in bed
Bet your buddy don't even know you don’t like red
Or was it fuchsia, fuck it, our future is dead

You bogus in the lambo if you ain't lifting the door up
You bogus poppin' pills if you ain't pickin the ho up
You bogus running out on your kids my nigga grow up
For God's sake, like a wedding, cutting large cake
For large stakes let the hammer bang broad day
Ay, nevermind what the blogs say
This what my mind and my heart say

My philosophy profit off of my properties
Get it, flip it, we got to be rich, that broke shit is obsolete
Possibly off of my rocker, watch how you watching me
Sophisticated, psychotic, fly as a pilot
Officially silent, all you wish you could get I got it
Unlimited titanium nigga, what's in yo wallet?
Out of gladiator college, I made it summa cum laude
While you clowns couldn't have got a cap and gown if you bought it
I parlay with Saudis, buying crude oil and diamonds
Hustle January, July, fly to Dubai
A broke nigga telling me 'bout how I'm dividing the pies
Like a blind nigga telling me it's an eye for an eye
Bullheaded and stubborn I be that way until I die
But find a nigga with more hustle then me I dare you to try
And according to the hand on my Audemar
It's my time to shine so fuck ya'll

What should I be sorry for
Who should I be sorry to
What should I be sorry for
Who should I be sorry to
The fact is you can't please everybody
You can't please everybody
What should I be sorry for
Who should I be sorry to

I grew up in the gutter, life a motherfucker
I guess that why I don't trust a motherfucker
Seen a nigga snitch on they mom, shoot at they brother
Go to prison in love with a bitch and a nigga fuck her
I seen real G's destroyed by real suckers
Innocent ladies raped and defenceless babies abducted
Such a horrible truth, but you see it over and over
It's nothing, get numb to it and your heart grow colder
Pacify your pain with a chain and a Rover
Fuck it, justify your action with stacking your dough up
You show up with a brick of cocaine and baking soda
Just enough for me to blow up, nigga hold up
Switch the flow up, 'cause these niggas be snitchin' so much
I promise all they missing's the badge, coffee, and donuts
Go to jail so what, never see my integrity perish
That ain't the Harris' way, study my pedigree
Promise I'm one of the only ones who keep it 100
Probably why I think they all out to get me, you can't convince me
Large money and fame will plant seeds of envy
To make my partners resent me enough to come and get me
Catch me slippin' and hit me, just like they did 50
'Cause I'm in the position that he think he should be given
Listen, dawg, the fact of the matter is
I'm on a narrow path and we all can't travel

What should I be sorry for
Who should I be sorry to
What should I be sorry for
Who should I be sorry to

What it ain't, What it is?
Even if you gotta live
I learned that apartment is way more exciting than a big ass house on a hill
I used to be a way better writer and a rapper
When I used to want a black Karmann Ghia
Now a nigga speeding in a Porsche
Feeling like I'm going off a course
Cut these fuck niggas off
Negative in my life, scream that till I'm hoarse
Duck these get the fuck off me projectiles, bitch you ain't really got a choice
I'm living my life live yours
I don't even like rapping fast, but that's how the word come to me
Talk to me sideways nigga that's your ass
Slow it down, this that shit that'll make you call your momma
Say hey I'm sorry for begging for all them clothes you couldn't afford
And this the type of shit that'll make you call your rap partner
And say I'm sorry I'm awkward, my fault for fuckin' up the tours
I hated all the attention so I ran from it
Fuck it if we did, but I hope we ain't lose no fans from it
I'm a grown-ass kid, you know ain't never cared about no damn money
Why do we try so hard to be stars, just to dodge comments
And this that shit that'll make you call your baby mama
When you gone on half a pill, don't know why but that's how it is
Then you take a flight back to the crib, y'all make love like college kids
And you say all the shit you gon' do better, we can try this shit again
'Round the time the dope wear off, you feel stupid, she feel lost
That's that dope, I mean, I mean dopamine you think Cupid done worn off
Waiting in the hallway with her arms crossed
Baby boy face full of applesauce
Maybe should have stayed but it ain't yo fault
Too much pressure, I peel off, I'm sorry
Was young and had to choose between you
And what the rest of the world might offer me, shit what would you do
Well I'd probably do it differently if second the chance
Only if some cool ass older man would've let me know in advance
This, this quarry, that is dug so deep in a father's chest
When he feel that he's broken up his nest
And he figured shit he was just doing the best that he could
Which end up being the worst that he could
And all some pussy nigga on the internet can say is that verse ain't good
It's boring, boring?
Really?

When I'm disgusted with this world and I can hardly breathe and
Told so many lies, don't know what to believe
I discussed it with this girl, and this is what she said
She said lay down baby, baby, rest your weary head up
I love these distractions but my mind don't wanna rest
But my body disagree so I laid up on her breasts, yes

Listen, I'm trying to tell you that
Time's running out, God, but we never knew
Night's getting cold and your story is old, it's been told

I let you in, I turned you loose
I gave you lot's of time to choose to change the story
You are the snake around my hand
The one who used to be my friend, and now you're sorry
I've suffered all the way, you will today

To clear my mind from the things that I have seen
On my knees, Father, please leave the crowd
And let me out

That I forgot just what I'm living for
I'm in the dark, light's so hard to find
So now I'm leaving it all behind, I'm changing skin

I realized there's no one you can trust
Shot in the back sinking in the night

You're in my arms, just let me take your pain
You're in my arms, I'm crying out your name

I saw that fear behind your stare, that hope to see tomorrow
It breaks my heart 'cause now you're gone, I wish that I could follow
And make you stay just one more day
I'm going down, someone please help me
Out of this world, nobody hears me
I close my eyes praying for you
But nobody cares even when I do

Days of my life which I have left, to you",In My Arms,1999

Tear my life apart, push me until I'll fall

Never look back, until the final curtain'll fall
Never look back, now you can leave it all

I wish he could leave it today under the wings of tomorrow

André Andersen,"Years of rejections and years of regrets, years of unbearable guilt,
Years of creating a dream life could never fulfill
Days of forgiveness and days of no trust toss me around like a toy
Days which will make me forget even seconds of joy

While pain is cutting like a knife I'm trying hard to reinvent
My life - all my life

Left in a cell with a window so small - barely feeling the sun
Sneaking the light on my skin. But my struggle's begun.
Pushing aside every shadow of fear, lifting myself from the ground,
Throwing the glove in the face of what's holding me down

While pain is working with it's knife I'm trying hard to reinvent
The rest - the bits and pieces of my life.",Life,2003

André Bernheim,"On se rappelle les chansons.
Un soir d'hiver, un frais visage,
La scène à marchands de marrons,
Une chambre au cinquième étage,
Les cafés crèmes du matin,
Montparnasse, le Café du Dôme,
Les faubourgs, le Quartier latin,
Les Tuileries et la Place Vendôme.

Paris, c'était la gaieté, Paris,
C'était la douceur aussi.
C'était notre tendresse.
Paris, tes gamins, tes artisans,
Tes camelots et tes agents
Et tes matins de printemps,
Paris, l'odeur de ton pavé d'oies,
De tes marronniers, du bois,
Je pense à toi sans cesse.
Paris, je m'ennuie de toi, mon vieux.
On se retrouvera tous les deux,
Mon grand Paris.

Évidemment, il y a parfois
Les heures un peu difficiles
Mais tout s'arrange bien, ma foi.
Avec Paris, c'est si facile.
Pour moi, Paris, c'est les beaux jours
Les airs légers, graves ou tendres.
Pour moi, Paris, c'est mes amours
Et mon cœur ne peut se reprendre.

Paris, tu es ma gaieté, Paris.
Tu es ma douceur aussi.
Tu es toute ma tendresse.
Paris, tes gamins, tes artisans,
Tes camelots et tes agents
Et tes matins de printemps,
Paris, l'odeur de ton pavé d'oies,
De tes marronniers, du bois.
Je pense à toi sans cesse.
Paris, je m'ennuie de toi, mon vieux.
On se retrouvera tous les deux,

André Bourvil,"A BICYCLETTE

1. Je m'en allais chercher des oies
Du côté de Fouilly-les-oies
A bicyclette.
Soudain qui vois-je devant moi ?
Un' belle fille au frais minois
A bicyclette.
En arrivant à sa hauteur,
J'y fais' un sourire enchanteur
A bicyclette.
Ell' rit aussi, on parle alors
Et ell' me dit dans nos transports
A bicyclette.

REFRAIN

Est-c'que vous êt's coureur !
Non j'ne suis pas coureur.
Ah ! c'que vous êt's menteur !
Moi je suis balayeur.
Avez-vous fait le tour ?
Non, mais j'ai des tours,
Des détours des contours
Et même d'autres tours...
Des tours de quoi qu'em' dit.
Des tours d'vélo, pardi !
Vous êtes un blagueur.
Ah ! c'que vous êt's coureur !

2. Dans les champs chantaient les grillons,
Le soleil dardait ses rayons
De bicyclette.
Ell' voulait que je chante un brin,
Mais à cela j'ai mis un frein
De bicyclette.
Près d'un tournant y'avait un bois
Où l'on se dirigea, ma foi
A bicyclette.
Mais comme ell' roulait près de moi
Voilà qu'èm' dit presqu'à mi-voix
A bicyclette.

REFRAIN

Ah ! c'que vous êt's coureur !
Moi... j'ne suis pas coureur.
Ah ! c'que vous êt's menteur !
Moi je suis balayeur.
Vous savez fair' la cour !
Oui, j'y réponds, car pour
Ce qui est de fair' la cour.
Je la fais chaque jour.
La cour à qui ? qu'em dit.
La cour d'la ferm' pardi !
Vous êtes un blagueur.
Ah ! c'que vous êt's coureur !
(Parlé :) Vous parlez d'un raisonnement.

3. Dans l'bois, j'y disais ""Voyez donc,
Sans boussole nous nous guidons,
De bicyclette.
Mais ell' répétait, plein d'ardeur,
Que j'étais un coureur, coureur
A bicyclette.
Je l'étais pas, ça c'est couru,
Mais alors, je l'suis devenu
A bicyclette.
Et comm' je courais vers le but
Voilà qu'èm' fait, comme au début
A bicyclette.

REFRAIN

Ah ! c'que vous êt's coureur !
Mais j'ne suis pas coureur.
Ah ! c'que vous êt's menteur !
Moi je suis balayeur,
J'y redis en courant,
Car j'continuais d'courir
Vers l'but à conquérir
(Vous êtes au courant)
Moi à forc' de courir,
Parcourir, discourir,
L'vélo s'est dégonflé
Et j'suis pas arrivé.
Moralité : Rien ne sert de courir
Il faut partir à point...

Je n’la mets pas sur les Angelus,
Je la mets sur les murs,
C’est normal, c’est ce qui s’fait le plus,

Ca dépend comment c’est s’lon.

R : La Rumba du pinceau,
Ca m’inspire le cerveau,
J’étal’ bien mes coloris,

Derrière mon p’tit pinceau,
Mais avec un peu d’enduit
Et puis du mastic aussi,
Je refais la façade,

Mais, c’est dang’reux là-haut ,
Un jour j’ai manqué de m’tuer,
J’voulais peindr’ au pistolet,
Heureus’ment j’mai loupé.

J’peins des tableaux, ça …ça colle,
Les tableaux noirs de l’écol’,
J’peins des toiles et j’en suis fier,
Hier j’ai peins l’étoile de mer.
J’peindrais bien des beaux nus,
Mais personne pour moi n’veut poser nu,
Ce n’sont plus des nus nus,
J’suis forcé d’peindre des nus tout vêtus,
J’suis malin (aussi)
Parfois j’peins les habits
Par terr’ à côté du nu.

Sauve les vieux tableaux,
Pour conserver ses vingt ans,

Quel tourment, la façade ;
Un monsieur comm’ y faut,
S’habille’ra toujours beau,
Mêm’ si la ch’mis’ sous l’paltôt
Ne cach’ pas le bas d’son dos,
Faut sauver la façade,
J’trouv’ qu’un mur décrépit,
C’est tout comme une femm’ qui enlaidit,
Moi, c’qu’est laid, je l’rend beau,
En cinq sec avec mon p’tit pinceau.

André Bourvil,"Moi quand j'étais jeune je ne voulais pas être artiste lyrique... Non, je voulais être ingénieur des ponts, puis des chaussées ; alors mes parents m'ont mis à l'école ; j'y suis réglé longtemps, j'y suis resté jusqu'à dix-neuf ans et demi, parce que j'avais du mal à avoir mon certificat d'études, alors j'y suis resté jusqu'à cet âge-là pour l'avoir. Mais vous savez, à l'école, on n'étudiait pas tout pour être ingénieur dans les ponts puis dans les chaussées ! Non ! Moi j'étudiais ça parce que j'avais ça dans le sang... le génie, l'initiative... Mais il y en avait d'autres qui étudiaient l'anglais parce qu'ils voulaient aller en Angleterre, d'autres qui étudiaient l'algèbre parce qu'ils voulaient aller à Alger... Je ne sais pas si vous avez été dans les grandes écoles, mais c'est comme ça que ça se passe !

Puis vous savez, quand on a terminé ses études en tant qu'ingénieur des ponts puis des chaussées, en sortant on a une place tout de suite... Alors moi, en sortant, j'ai débuté comme chef cantonnier. Alors là j'avais l'initiative, on m'avait confié le commandement ; j'avais quatre cantonniers sous mes ordres. J'avais les plans, je calculais, parce que vous savez, dans les routes... tant de trous... tant de cailloux... tant de brouettes... n'est-ce pas... les multiplications, puis les divisions... Enfin, j'avais les études pour ça, c'était normal. Et tout le monde me connaissait bien là-bas, même les gosses... De loin, ils me criaient : «L'ingénieur!... L’ingénieur !... » Ils savaient bien que j'étais ingénieur!... Après ça, le moment d'aller au régiment est venu ; alors je me suis dit : en tant qu'ingénieur, ils vont me repérer... Ça n'a pas manqué, ils m'ont mis dans le génie... Mais là j'étais chez moi... avec tous les ingénieurs ! Ils m'appelaient « l'ingénieur d'ailleurs »!... Ils m'appelaient même « l'homme lumière»... pour rigoler... parce que j'avais été versé dans une section motocycliste comme éclaireur. Dans les manœuvres, je partais de l’avant et j'éclairais avec ma moto, je faisais de la lumière. Un jour j'ai eu un ennui parce que ma moto était en panne ; j'étais embarrassé parce que moi j'ai fait mes études dans les ponts puis dans les chaussées, mais dans le moteur... non.... mais quand même je n'ai pas voulu en rester là... Dans le génie on est tous comme ça, on veut toujours voir plus loin... découvrir... J'en ai pas eu pour longtemps... J'ai l'habitude de chercher... J'ai vu un truc qui giclait... le gicleur... Ensuite la bougie, j'ai fait faire l'étincelle... En moins de deux ça y était... j'avais foutu le feu à la moto. J'étais embarrassé parce que j'avais de l'essence sur ma capote, alors j'ai pris feu. Ça me chauffait... ça me chauffait... Mais quand même j'ai pas perdu mon sang-froid... Toujours l'initiative ! Il y avait un herbage à côté, je me suis roulé dans l'herbe pour tout étouffer... toujours l'initiative !... Mais je n'avais pas fait attention que dans l'herbage il y avait beaucoup de vaches, alors naturellement il y avait beaucoup de... puis forcément je me suis roulé dedans... et plus je me roulais... plus j'en écrasais !... Surtout moi qui suis lourd... J'avais bien appris à l'école : pierre qui roule n'amasse pas mousse, mais je vous garantis que si Pierre... il en n'a pas ramassé de la mousse... moi j'en ai ramassé... J'étais plutôt emmoussaillé... Puis pour mes brûlures c'était pas bon... Je savais bien que l'on mettait de la pommade, mais tout de même pas celle-là. Mais quand même je n'ai pas perdu le nord... toujours l'initiative !... Il y avait une mare à côté ; je me suis dit, je vais plonger, ça va tout éteindre... Aussitôt dit, aussitôt fait, je plonge jusqu'au fond... Ça n'a pas loupé !... Surtout que je ne sais pas nager, alors j'ai eu plus de facilité. J'étais au fond, je ne pouvais plus remonter, alors les copains m'ont repêché ; je me suis retrouvé à l'hôpital. Le docteur est venu et m'a dit : « Alors ! Sacré ingénieur ! (parce qu'il savait bien que j'étais ingénieur), Tu t'es noyé, tu t'es brûlé... tu t'es jeté dans l'eau bouillante ? » Je lui dis : « Non, docteur ! Je brûlais, alors, vous comprenez j'ai plongé !... » Alors il me dit : « Tu as dû être transi ! » Je lui dis : « Non, docteur, j'étais bien couvert !...»",L' Ingénieur,2008
André Bourvil,"Le métier que j' préfère, c'est inventeur !... Oui!... Parce qu'inventeur c'est un métier où il faut déployer beaucoup d'intelligence et d'initiative. Alors y' m' semble que là-dessus j'ai pas à m' plaindre... j' suis bien servi !... hein !... On m'avait dit : « Si tu arrives à inventer quelque chose, tu n'auras qu'à en parler à un financier, il t'achètera ton invention, ça te rapportera beaucoup. » Alors j'ai décidé d'y aller. En arrivant, la secrétaire m'a dit : « Justement on vous attendait ! » J' m' dis comme ça : « Ça tombe bien ». Elle m'a dit : « Rentrez, on va vous introduire tout de suite ! » Alors j' la Vois revenir avec un grand balai ; j'commençais à avoir peur et j' lui dis : « Je ne suis pas le balayeur, excusez-moi ! » Elle me répond : « Y a pas de mal ! » J' lui dis : « Si, y a une valise, c'est là-dedans que j' mets mon invention ! » Elle m' dit : « Vous êtes inventeur ?... » J' lui dis : « Oui ». Elle m' dit : « L'habit fait pas le moine ». J' lui dis : « Oui »... J'étais un peu troublé. Elle m' dit : « On va vous faire attendre un peu ». J' lui dis : « Oui, mais pas trop, longtemps !... » Alors j'attends trois heures !... Je m' disais comme ça, si ça continue ça va pas tarder à être long. J' m'étais assis sur ma valise en attendant parce que j'avais peur qu'on me vole mon invention, si toutefois j' m'étais endormi. Puis pendant tout le temps que j'attendais il y avait les dactylos ; elles entr'ouvraient la porte les unes après les autres pour me r'garder... puis elles riaient ! Elles étaient jeunes, fallait bien qu'elles s'amusent !... Ou alors peut-être bien qu'elles rigolaient parce que j'étais sympathique... Peut-être !... Ou alors elles me regardaient pour m'épier parce qu'elles avaient peur que j' m'en aille avec mon invention. A un moment j'ai même abusé, je leur ai fait peur, je leur ai dit : « Si vous me faites attendre encore... trois ou quatre heures, j' vais m'en aller avec mon invention... » Alors là elles ont eu peur. Le soir même j'étais reçu par le directeur. J' lui dis : « Bonjour... » J' lui dis : « J' suis l'inventeur ! » Il m' répond : « J' suis sceptique ! » J' lui réponds : « Enchanté ! » Y m' dit : « Vous savez que pour être inventeur il faut avoir un certain bagage !... » J' lui réponds pas, mais sans avoir l'air de rien j' lui fais voir ma valise. Alors là il a été suffoqué, il en a même fait une réflexion à sa secrétaire ; il lui a dit : « Qu'est-ce qui traîne... » I m'a dit : « Vous avez une certaine ressemblance avec celui qui a inventé le fil à couper le beurre !... » J' lui dis : « Ça s' peut très bien, y a eu tellement d'inventeurs dans ma famille. » Alors j' lui ai présenté mon invention, je lui ai dit : « Voilà, j'ai inventé quelque chose pour attraper les crocodiles vivants !... » Alors, tout d' suite intéressé dans l'affaire, y m' répond : « Ah !... très bien !... » Je lui dis : « Voilà : il faut une valise pour mettre l'invention, puis pour rapporter le crocodile ; une paire de jumelles, des journaux (parce que quand vous avez rendez-vous avec un crocodile, si toutefois il vous fait attendre, vous lisez l'journal), puis une pince à épiler ; alors vous allez dans un endroit où y a des crocodiles, autant que possible (sans quoi vous êtes obligé d'emporter un stock de journaux), puis vous attendez, et quand vous voyez le crocodile s'amener, faut pas avoir peur... Tout simplement vous prenez votre jumelle... mais... mais... vous la prenez par le gros bout... du sens opposé... Alors, forcément.. l' crocodile !... vous 1' voyez tout p'tit !... Il est fait comme un rat... Enfin, comme un crocodile, mais il est tout p'tit ; alors vous prenez votre pince à épiler, puis vous l' mettez dans le panier !... Voilà !... »",L' Inventeur,2008
André Bourvil,"Chansonnier... c'est un bon métier aussi... ça rapporte... parce qu'il y a le « droit d'auteur »... Vous ne savez pas ce que c'est le droit d'auteur ?... Ben !... je vais vous l'expliquer... Je me suis renseigné auprès d'un camarade chansonnier... Pensez bien que j'aurais pas voulu m'engager dans ce métier-là sans savoir. Le droit d'auteur c'est comme de l'argent que vous touchez... plus ou moins... selon la hauteur... Si vous êtes grand chansonnier... si... euh !... enfin... c'est le droit d'auteur. Maintenant pour moi ça marche bien, je suis au théâtre des deux ânes... J'y suis rentré assez bêtement... C'est le directeur du théâtre des deux ânes qui m'a écrit qu'il y en avait un des deux qui était malade, alors si je voulais le remplacer... Pensez bien que j'ai sauté sur l'occasion. J'ai bien vu comment ils faisaient les autres chansonniers... c'est pas difficile... Quand on est chansonnier il faut faire des chansons sur ce qui se passe, alors eux... les chansonniers, qu'est-ce qu'ils font ?... Ils achètent le journal, puis ils lisent ce qu'il y a dessus, alors ils ne sont pas plus bêtes que d'autres, ils comprennent bien ce qu'ils lisent... Alors ils le mettent en vers et contre tous... Voilà... Vous n'avez peut-être pas bien compris ?... Je vais vous donner un exemple... Par exemple, sur le journal, vous voyez : « Aujourd'hui on ne touche pas de viande »... Ben... c'est le titre de votre chanson !... Mais si l'on en touche, faut changer... C'est vrai qu'en ce moment on est tranquille... on est parfois trois semaines sans changer. Puis il faut mettre ça sur un air, un air de danse... n'importe quoi... la danse devant le buffet par exemple... ou autre chose... un air vache... ou un air bœuf, ça corse un peu. Ecoutez la mienne... C'est sur un sujet original... c'est sur le ravitaillement.

Avec mes tickets d'viande mon boucher l'autre soir, 
Voulait m'donner du mou, mais j'ai laissé l' mou... choir 
Mouchoir... Hein!...  Il est bon...  Ça porte (rires), puis aux deux
ânes mes camarades chansonniers sont gentils avec moi, quand je fais
un jeu de mots, pour créer l'ambiance ils font  : hi ! han ! hi ! han !…
parce qu'ils me disent que c'est moi  le plus qualifié pour représenter les deux ânes.
Le franc est dévalué, il vaut un sou maintenant 
A ce prix-là  le franc n'est vraiment  qu'un sous franc 
Souffrant... Hein !... Il est bien aussi celui-là...  Il porte... surtout à l'étranger...

Maintenant, le troisième  :
Y a des engins nouveaux qui font sensation... on 
(Là il me manquait un pied...  alors j'ai ajouté on... Je vais vous expliquer après...)
Mais  aux  bomb's atomiques je préfère les bomb'... on...
Bonbons... Hein... Il est peut-être plus difficile à comprendre mais il est bien aussi... celui-là.

Quatrième :
Pour faire la soupe, mettez un verre de lunettes 
Dans un livre de messe... ça f'ra un verr' missel...
Vermicelle... Hein !... (rires) il est bien aussi celui-là... L'autre jour il y a un spectateur qui m'avait tellement compris qu'il m'a jeté un poireau sur la scène en me disant : « Tiens !… tu mettras ça dans ta soupe !... ça corsera...

Cinquième   :
Si vous applaudissez brav' gens ma p'tite chanson 
Je penserai de vous que vous êtes des gens bons.
Jambons... Hein !...  Il est bien aussi...  Il porte...  surtout chez les charcutiers...
Euh !... euh !... j'ai fini !...",Je suis chansonnier,2008
André Bush,"Speak low when you speak, love,
Our summer day withers away
Too soon, too soon.

Speak low when you speak, love,
Our moment is swift, like ships adrift,
We're swept apart too soon.

Speak low, darling speak low,
Love is a spark lost in the dark,
Too soon, too soon,
I feel wherever I go
That tomorrow is near, tomorrow is here
And always too soon.

Time is so old and love so brief,
Love is pure gold and time a thief.

From some enchanted land.
Down deep in my heart, I hear it say,
Is this the day?

I alone have heard this lovely strain,
I alone have heard this glad refrain:
Must it be forever inside of me,
Why can't I let it go,
Why can't I let you know,
Why can't I let you know the song

André Claveau,"UN BRUIT DE SABOTS

La femme souvent 
Changeait ses robes et ses gants
Et ses chapeaux minuscules
Mais elle a trouvé un rien qui parait imiter
Le tic-tac d’une pendule

REFRAIN

Un bruit de sabots
Monte dans la ville
De jolis sabots
Aux mille couleurs
Sous de fins mollets
Ils filent filent filent
Ils charment les yeux
Et grisent les cœurs
Un bruit de sabots monte dans la ville
De jolis sabots 
Aux mille couleurs

J’ai vu dans le soir
Oui j’ai vu deux beaux souliers noirs
Suivre deux sabots … mystère !
M’arrêtant soudain
J’entendis des baisers câlins 
Et puis ils se séparèrent 

REFRAIN

Viens avec moi dans la clairière
Faisons l’école buissonnière
Nous verrons près d’une rivière
Un bungalow au bord de l’eau
La brise passe et batifole
Autour de nous les branches folles 
semblent murmurer des paroles 
Au bungalow 
Au bord de l’eau

A tous ils ont plu
Mais si leur vogue ne tient plus
Qui sait … dans quelques années
L’enfant à noël
Pourra d’un geste solennel
Les mettre en sa cheminée

Dors du tu veux que jamais ne s’achèvent

C’est le soir qui t’embrasse en passant
Ou la lune en montant qui dépose
Un baiser sur ton corps innocent

Dors bien tranquille longtemps

Avec la jeunesse, passent les années
On oublie tendresse, berceaux et poupées
Mais l’enfant sommeille et quand vient l’amour
Vite il se réveille, pour dire à son tour :

Dors mon amour, ma plus douce espérance
Dors mon immense bonheur
Dors si tu veux, sur tes lèves mi-closes
Que je dépose mon cœur
Mais déjà nos deux corps vagabondent
Au pays des frissons merveilleux

Qui nous puisse empêcher d’être heureux

Glissons un voile tout bleu.

But when you're by my side I fill with pride

Pierre Benoît ou Paul Morand ?
Penses-tu trouver dans leurs livres
De quoi rêver des nuits des jours

Nous sommes entrain de le vivre
N'avons-nous pas assez lutté
Pour vivre ensemble et nous aimer ?
Ferme les yeux, recueille-toi...
Car tu sais aussi bien que moi

Un amour comme le nôtre
Il n'en existe pas deux
Ce n'est pas celui des autres,
C'est quelque chose de mieux
Sans me parler
Je sais ce que tu veux me dire...
A mon regard
Tu vois tout ce que je désire...
Pourquoi demander aux autres
Un roman plus merveilleux ?
Un amour comme le nôtre
Il n'en existe pas deux.

Je sais, les romans c'est certain,
T'emmènent en des pays lointains
Sous des ciels bleus, de clairs rivages...
Oui, mais là-bas qu'y trouve-t-on ?
Des rues, des taxis, des maisons...
Chérie, méfie-toi des mirages...
Tiens, regarde notre intérieur
Des livres, des chansons, des fleurs
Et mes deux bras pour te bercer...
Et mon coeur pour toujours t'aimer...

Qui me déroutes

Sera sévère

Et tu pourras crier pour me retenir
Et tu pourras pleurer sur tes souvenirs","Toi, Le Venin",2004

André Kostelanetz,"Memories light the corners of my mind
Misty water-colored memories of the way we were
Scattered pictures of the smiles we left behind
Smiles we gave to one another for the way we were

Can it be that it was all so simple then
Or has time rewritten every line
If we had the chance to do it all again
Tell me, would we?
Could we?

What's too painful to remember
We simply choose to forget
So it's the laughter we will remember

André Kostelanetz,"If it's magic
Then why can't it be everlasting
Like the sun that always shines
Like the poets in this rhyme
Like the galaxies in time

Then why can't it be never leaving
Like the day that never fails
Like on seashores there are shells
Like the time that always tells 
It holds the key to every heart
Throughout the universe
It fills you up without a bite
And quenches every thirst 
So
If it's special
Then with it why aren't we as careful
As making sure we dress in style
Posing pictures with a smile
Keeping danger from a child 
It holds the key to every heart
Throughout the universe
It fills you up without a bite
And quenches every thirst

It will leave no heart undone
For there's enough for everyone",If It's Magic,1978

It brings back the sound of music so tender
It brings back a night of tropical splendor
It brings back a memory ever green

And down by the shore an orchestra's playing
And even the palms seem to be swaying
When they begin the beguine

To live it again is past all endeavor
Except when that tune clutches my heart
And there we are, swearing to love forever
And promising never, never to part

What moments divine, what rapture serene
Till clouds came along to disperse the joys we had tasted
And now when I hear people curse the chance that was wasted
I know but too well what they mean

Let the love that was once a fire remain an ember
Let it sleep like the dead desire I only remember

Till the stars that were there before return above you
Till you whisper to me once more, ""Darling, I love you""

I've come to talk with you again,
Because a vision softly creeping,
Left its seeds while I was sleeping,
And the vision that was planted in my brain
Still remains
Within the sound of silence.
In restless dreams I walked alone
Narrow streets of cobblestone,
'Neath the halo of a street lamp,
I turned my collar to the cold and damp
When my eyes were stabbed by the flash of a neon light
That split the night
And touched the sound of silence.

And in the naked light I saw
Ten thousand people, maybe more.
People talking without speaking,
People hearing without listening,
People writing songs that voices never share
And no one dare
Disturb the sound of silence.

""Fools"" said I, ""You do not know
Silence like a cancer grows.
Hear my words that I might teach you,
Take my arms that I might reach you.""
But my words like silent raindrops fell,
And echoed
In the wells of silence

And the people bowed and prayed
To the neon god they made.
And the sign flashed out its warning,
In the words that it was forming.
And the sign said, ""The words of the prophets

Are written on the subway walls
And tenement halls.""
And whisper'd in the sounds of silence.",The Sounds of Silence,2002

Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb
Always reminding me that we're apart
You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms

Tells his fairytale
Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain

André Kostelanetz & His Orchestra,"And now the purple dusk of twilight time
Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb
Always reminding me that we're apart
You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms
The nightingale 
Tells his fairytale
Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain
My stardust melody
The memory of love's refrain.",Stardust,2000

It brings back the sound of music so tender
It brings back a night of tropical splendor

And down by the shore an orchestra's playing
And even the palms seem to be swaying

Except when that tune clutches my heart
And there we are, swearing to love forever
And promising never, never to part

What moments divine, what rapture serene
Till clouds came along to disperse the joys we had tasted
And now when I hear people curse the chance that was wasted
I know but too well what they mean

So don't let them begin the beguine
Let the love that was once a fire remain an ember
Let it sleep like the dead desire I only remember

Andre Mehmari,"Day after day
Alone on a hill
The man with the foolish grin
Is keeping perfectly still
But nobody wants to know him
They can see that he's just a fool
And he never gives an answer

But the fool on the hill
Sees the sun going down
And the eyes in his head
See the world spinning round

Well on the way
Head in a cloud
The man of a thousand voices
Talking perfectly loud

But nobody ever hears him
Or the sounds he appears to make
And he never seems to notice

But the fool on the hill
Sees the sun going down
And the eyes in his head
See the world spinning round

And nobody seems to like him
They can tell what he wants to do
And he never shows his feelings

But the fool on the hill
Sees the sun going down
And the eyes in his head
See the world spinning round

He never listens to them
He knows that they're the fools
They don't like him

Sees the sun going down
And the eyes in his head
See the world spinning round

Andre Mehmari,"I once had a girl 
Or should I say she once had me 
She showed me her room 
Isn't it good Norwegian wood? 

She asked me to stay 
And she told me to sit anywhere 
So I looked around 
And I noticed there wasn't a chair 

I sat on a rug biding my time 
Drinking her wine 
We talked until two and then she said 
""It's time for bed"" 

She told me she worked 
In the morning and started to laugh 
I told her I didn't 
And crawled off to sleep in the bath 

And when I awoke I was alone

I said I'll stay a sec, you said, stay a while
You started sippin' wine, said I was on your mind
I said I'm thinking of you too girl, your hella fine
We hit the night time, for a late date
And everyday after that, for 8 months straight
We would roll tight, we had small fights
You shoulda seen how we argued under street lights
I couldn't see your tears, from the pouring rain
You shoulda seen my body shake, when she said my name

She said I'm not the same, Andre ya changed
I said baby its pain, from the rap game
We went our separate ways, man I was hurt for days
Man I didn't even call, I went through withdrawal
Flashbacks of her face hit me sometime
And I be wonderin' man does she think of mine
I think of Rose

[Chorus: ]
Love is down through the hardest times
Sometimes I put Al Green on and think of Rose
Being with you is just a state of mind
Girl, thinking about you all the time

I saw her at a club, she was with a thug
She thought I would say hi, but I didn't show no love
The homey blazin' bud, and now its getting live
But I knew that she knew, that I'd protect my pride
I see her watchful eye, from across the joint
And then she knew how I feel, if I heard her voice
And some ladies talked, and other ladies walked
But when it came to you girl, man there was a spark
Your whole anatomy, man, was like poetry
The very smell of your hair was like luxury
It was because of me, when the days was bright
I would come through with my silent nights
Man, I think of Rose

Andre Nickatina,"Pain from a rap cat
Man you didn't know that
Three AM, man, we bumping Bobby Womack
My homie keep all his bullets hollow
That's why I smell like Salvatori Faragomo with the diamond sparrow
A rap cat with the BOSS apparel
I put my rhymes on your block then I run it just like little Darrell
Money and dope, man, don't come for free
Man, I don't have no competition, ho, all I got is enemies
I turn around like a tornado
Rock it like a baby cradle
Call me Doctor J if you a baller and it's getting fatal
I make MC's do angel dust
Take 'em to the Bay Bridge, make 'em strip, tell 'em jump
I don't know why I get high
I'm so in love with money I keep spending 'til it runs dry
Hot like a kettle, when the pedal hits the metal
Pinocchio you know son is Jepetio, hello
Deep fried just like Friday fish
A lot a hot sauce, now we got it popping in this bitch

Yeah, in anything I do I put my everything
Always feeling deep inside just like Mary J.
Ha, I'm never panicing, I'm bored stiff as a mannequin
Grew up fast just like Anakin
Baby its gullible, its Alice in Wonderland
All the excuses in the world I can't understand
Cause I'm a man of these times, the man to get high
Blow big, but my gross is family time
Ain't no way to intervene in my industry
Moving quicker then a centipede on enemies
One of a kind, once in a lifetime rhymes is written
It goes on, as long as time commences

Shit, it's like a jungle sometimes
It makes me wonder how I keep from going under
When they hit me with the thunder and lightning
Its trifling, enlightening, and frightening
Some might think that it's even exciting

I'm like a Harley Davidson motorcycle, born to ride
With the force that the courts call the last Jedi
I'm like a veteran, off Excedrin's
Cause I be getting headaches from these Letterman's
I asked this little freak about my rap style
She said, ""It's so damn dope they might take you to trial.""
I hit the weed like I'm kamikaze next to the cosmos
Chopping up shit, yeah, with Quipto and Vago
Raps like a Tommy gun, watch how the body run
Raps from the Tommy gun will make anybody run

I'm bout to go in like a movie, but no stunt double so parachute me
But somehow I feel I survived on a fluky
I have to hit the scene, livin' out my dreams
Then I said I was sorry to DJ's and MC's
Complete to everyone who kept their ear to the street
Then my homie came through with the Al Capone Suite
Got twice as deep, don't forget, you know how low they get
Intimidating so I pose a threat
Coming like a slider, right by ya
Known to drop a rhyme in on time, and prescribing accurate alignment
The center of attention, we'll bend a agenda
To enter this rap game the number one contender
The outta sight, and dope lyrical white, and watchin' tricks fightin'
Hyping up the crowd late night, and watching Tennessee Titans
Everybody just loving because we like and
I strike in first class light fast, just like lightning

I force my rhymes in your veins like hot shot of heroin
You'll got cold turkey trying to work me
It's like a pad lock, when you in the headlock
Six in the morning and you didn't here the Feds knock

It's like a jungle sometimes
It makes me wonder how I keep from going under
When they hit me with the thunder and lightning
Its trifling, enlightening, and frightening
Some might think that it's even exciting

I'm consistent, adding all statistics
Why don't we cover the spread like the bitch never existed
Phonographic rotate the plastic spinning
Living like I'm knowing it's gonna be a drastic ending
Playing classics, meditating these tactics to overcome
The show is done, anticipating to roll a blunt
Baby, getting anxious, hitting and I can't miss the focal point
When locals say, ""He ain't shit.""
Man it's Equipto, put it all down for my homies
And rolling my weed right next to the police
Nothing but love for all my homeboys hustling drugs
Up in your program fucking it up

I'm in the fast lane, the cash lane, some think it's a bad thing
Hitting 'em off with the see & H pure cane
I get stuck in your membrane
I'm like a pimp at a party when you say look at them rings
I use a Motorola, the mood is baking soda
Whether it's in Denver, man, Houston, man, or North Dakota
With no apology, tech-tech-tech technology

I got the soul and the spirit of the wrath of Kahn
Kick back and write just like the holy Koran

Andre Nickatina,"Situation critical cause shit ain't nothin nice
Motherfuckers play for keeps so niggas lose they life
Money comes in different ways, the dope game's kinda slow
Niggas used to havin money are lookin kinda po'
Dank or dope, there ain't no hope these niggas peelin' caps
Gangstas pullin major leagues and brag about the jack
Situation critical this chewy got me stuck
Indo calm a nigga down but keeps a nigga pumped
My partners mamas smokin rocks and turns into a ho
And since they fuck with that right nigga the gat will snort and blow
Killas move in silence and the jokers run they mouth
Fightin fools that don't exist take that nigga out
'Cause his love is murder, two jack burgers takin your respect
Coke and dank sex then baked your homies in the set
So flash yo cash and whoop your ass if you've got more than me
And whatever you got is more than mine so nigga let me see
'Cause jealousy's reality when it comes to niggas bread
And snitches go from rags to riches rattin' to the feds
Cause coke is queen and money is king and niggas want the crown
So all you niggas goin up you fuckers goin down
The situations critical with stories on the streets
Kill em dead and get yo bread but make sure that you eat
But I ain't done yet
The situations critical

My baby's momas trippin, got my son and I can't keep him
Wanna cry to hear him on the phone, but she won't let me see him
This chewy got me paranoid and goin kinda scared
Niggas startin to know my face so I had to cut my hair
'Cause nigga, shit is gettin thick from here to Alabama
'Cause every nigga's tryin ta like Tony ""Face"" Montana
Some niggas talk about they'll kill, but nigga no you won't
Some niggas that dream of playin hoop but end up sellin dope
'Cause 3, 6, 5 like everyday man dolja takes it toll
And motherfuckas live to be a G Original
'Cause kill groups, its keys the juke, and rubber band they G's
Money shows this ain't no joke, well bow down to your knees
Situation critical, fuck a 9 to 5
Chewy got these niggas amped and they ain't scared to die
So miss me with that bullshit and hit me with that bank
Miss me with that bammer bitch and rush me with that dank
Time is runnin out partna, time ain't runnin in
My freedom is the only life, so fuck the fuckin pen
So as I chew my juicy fruit and think about the dead
And all my niggas that had died because they had some bread
My mind is on another level nigga this is typical
Check my eyes I'm dyin inside, situations critical
Situations critical

Niggas dressin rich, knowin they broke without a doubt
Born and raised in the same hood in a roach infested house
Situation critical I think I'm bout to die
The enemy is creepin up and fuckin off my high
A nigga hit the 5th and makes it home in desperation
Wipe the sweat, hold my chest, and then I plot retaliation
Now before you clown you best calm down cause I read you like a book
Now must you stare cause I don't care, cause I won't even look
Thangs ain't what they used to be a motherfucka told ya
Niggas got the mind to kill and that includes the rollers
'Cause 2, 4, 7 like everyday niggas servin cluckers
Beatin up the bustas, fuckin Tommy Tuckers
Some niggas say they gangstas and they love when money folds
But mosta the time these niggas be beefin over hoes
'Cause pussy comes a savage beast and it also makes you broke
Especially when that sexy freak is snortin all your coke
So check my situation fool and check my state of mind
No matter how you makin paper nigga, thats a grind
My indo have an increase this week from eighth up to a half
And nothin funny motherfucka, nigga why you laugh?
So fuck this fame and fuck these records, motherfuck these raps
My mother's broke there ain't no hope, her son ain't got no snaps
Its the same old song I'm doin wrong, fool this is typical
Fuck the fuckin world mama, situations critical

S'en va le ruisseau jusqu'au grand fleuve de la plaine

Tout doux, tout doux, tout doucement

Tout doux, tout doux, tout doucement
Rien ne peut changer ni du courant ni de ma peine

Tout doux, tout doux, tout doucement
J'ai fait comme l'eau je suis allée vers l'océan

Mais en arrivant j'ai rencontré
Celui qui allait te remplacer
Sans rien dire il a su me plaire
Et j'ai refait chemin contraire

Tout doux, tout doux, tout doucement
On est mieux en remontant jusqu'à la source

Tout doux, tout doux, tout doucement
Le soleil a fait de mon c?ur une fleur des champs

Tout doux, tout doux, tout doucement

Tout doux, tout doux, tout doucement

Car les jeux de l'eau et de l'amour
Sont insaisissables sans retour
Quand je les croise je regrette

Rules 'fore I hit it, split it, lick it and quit it
And hit it, lick it, did I say lick it, (yeah) fuck it, lick it
Ain't no shame in my game, that normal shit ain't my thing
If I think with my dick then put your mouth on my brain
I maintain through the atmosphere, what we got here
A sucker in fear, hear the roars and the cheers
From the crowd when I take the mile, let me show 'em how
Hit the ball on the ground and make 'em get down

I say the fish don't fry in the kitchen
Beans don't burn on the grill (that's right)
It took a whole lot of trying
Just to get up that hill
I said but now we're up in the big leagues
My dirty it's our turn at bat
And just as long as we living, it's Lunatics player
It ain't nothing wrong with that, batter up

Well this next young batter on deck
He's still in high school (yeah I heard that)
(It's a great day though) 
A good high school out in U-City of St. Louis, Missouri
(I think his name's umm, who knows,
Murphey Lee or something)

I want my name not, not said but screamed
I went from fantasies to dreams, dreams to bigger things
I'm like Bennett I been in it since, ninety-three
You can tell cause my L angle 90 degrees
I'ma sixteen year-old school boy, platinum skills
Swear to tell the real, the whole real to make a mill'
I lie little but still, talk straight up like motto
I could tell you something now, you think twice about it tomorrow
I promise, I gets deeper than file cabinets when rapping
Money, money, money, money what's happening
I'm coming up like family members in basements, and I stay bent
Make a milli to play with, buy a building you can pay me
And the 'tic is who I came with
You know how we do, we do, we do, we do, we do, we do

Old black magic that you weave so well 
Those icy fingers up and down my spine

Same old tingle that I feel inside

Down and down I go

André Previn,"Away in a manger, no crib for his bed,
the little Lord Jesus laid down his Sweet head.
The stars in the bright sky looked down where he lay,
The little Lord Jesus asleep on the hay.

The cattle are lowing, the baby awakes,
But little Lord Jesus no crying he makes.
I love thee, Lord Jesus! Look down from the sky,
And stay by my side until morning is nigh.

Be near me, Lord Jesus; I ask thee to stay
Close by me forever, and love me, I pray.
Bless all the dear children in thy tender care,
And fit us for heaven, to live with thee there.",Away in a Manger,1968

And wondering why it's me you're wronging
I tell you I mean it
I'm all for you body and soul

I can't believe it
It's hard to conceive it
That you'd turn away romance
Are you pretending

André Previn,"The jam is jumpin'
The drums are pumpin'
The groove is lockin' in the rhythm like we want it to be

No time for stallin'
We're really haulin'
We've gotta keep it in the pocket or we'll stagger behind

You never know just when to leave it when you're riffin' in time
Or if the time itself will falter, or of words even rhyme
But we admit, the trick to it is not to think about it
When you're busy bravin' all the notes in the line

This time we mean it
We're gonna swing it
And take you right up to the end before we try to unwind

I've never been the kind of guy who could just normally quit
Never could decide when to rest my pride
And feel all right with just good enough
Thoughts, they gather
Tellin' me to look to find a bright new way
To assemble all the stimulated motives that haunt me
Tryin' a live it, be in the moment, tryin' to sing it alone
Can beckon to me, a feelin' of being bent
So I believe, takin' a leave is the brightest way to stop
All the chatter boxin' going 'round in my brain
So I'm wailin' - movin' and groovin' this part of this song
I hope that my riff's good enough to keep
Better leave it now or go out of my mind

Now I dig you think that perfect's what we should make it
But I've been down that road and I can tell ya how we feel's
The most important thing about it
Whether you're right or whether you might think
We're pathetic
A little lighter on the reins will help you loosen up the chains
That are still binding you,
In the past, whenever thoughts I had would try to re-
Evaluate all that I would do
I'd hesitate, consolidate, and motivate
All the little pearls of doubt that strive to break up
Every single bit of
Precious joy that flowed from god's soul spark that
Shines within me
That's it in a nut shell
So take advice from this sap, go for feel and leave it alone

Now's the time to sing
Swing is what we bring
Rhythm that's the thing
To really get your spirit movin' higher

Gonna jump and play
Dance the night away
Make you really sway
And let the music take you even higher

E-lla sang this song real special
Come on, come on, we'll sing this special song for you

One more one we'll go
But before we blow
We want you to know
The take is really good enough, we'll keep it!",Good Enough to Keep,1975

Couldn't sleep, wouldn't sleep
Love came and told me, shouldn't sleep
Bewitched, bothered and bewildered, am I

I lost my heart, but what of it
She is cold I agree
She might laugh, but I love it
Although the laugh's on me

I'll sing to her, bring spring to her
And long, for the day when I'll cling to her

André Previn,"I'm as restless as a willow in a windstorm, I'm as jumpy as puppet on a string
I'd say that I had spring fever, but I know it isn't spring
I am starry eyed and vaguely discontented, like a nightingale without a song to sing
O why should I have spring fever, when it isn't even spring 

I keep wishing I were someone else, walking down a strange new street
And hearing words that I've never heard from a girl I've yet to meet
I'm as busy as spider spinning daydreams, spinning spinning daydreams
I'm as giddy as a baby on a swing 

I haven't seen a crocus or a rosebud, or a robin on the wing
But I feel so gay in a melancholy way, that it might as well be spring

And slightly dopey gent, you are

My funny valentine, sweet comic valentine
You make me smile with my heart
Your looks are laughable, un-photographable

A beautiful theme of every
Dream I ever knew.
Down deep in my heart I hear it play.
I feel it start, then melt away.

I hear music when I touch your hand,
A beautiful melody
From some enchanted land.
Down deep in my heart, I hear it say,
Is this the day?

I alone have heard this lovely strain,
I alone have heard this glad refrain,
Must it be forever inside of me,
Why can't I let it go,
Why can't I let you know,

Of love and youth and spring,

Of things I can't forget, journeys on a jet

And thanks for the memory
Of summers by the sea, dawn in Waikiki
We had a pad in London, but we didn't stop for tea
How cozy it was

Now since our breakup, I wake up
Alone on a gray morning-after
I long for the sound of your laughter
And then I see the laugh's on me

Of every touch and thrill; I've been through the mill
I've lived a lot and learned a lot; you loved me not and still
I miss you so much

Thanks for the memory
Of how we used to jog even in a fog
That barbecue in Malibu away from all the smog
How rainy it was

Thanks for the memory
Of letters I destroyed, books that we enjoyed
Tonight, the way things look, I need a book by Sigmund Freud
How brainy he was

Gone are those evenings on Broadway
Together we'd go to a great show
But now I begin with the Late Show

André Previn,"When the mellow moon begins to beam
Every night I dream a little dream
And of course Prince Charming is the theme
The he, for me.

Although I realize as well as you
It is seldom that a dream comes true
To me it's clear
That he'll appear

Some day he'll come along, the man I love
And he'll be big and strong, the man I love
And when he comes my way
I'll do my best to make him stay

He'll look at me and smile; I'll understand
And in a little while he'll take my hand
And though it seems absurd
I know we both won't say a word

Maybe I shall meet him Sunday
Maybe Monday, maybe not
Still I'm sure to meet him one day
Maybe Tuesday will be my good news day

He'll build a little home just meant for two
From which I'll never roam; who would? Would you?
And so all else above
I'm waiting for the man I love",The Man I Love,2002

In a cottage close by a stream
I know it all by heart now - we're about to part now
It's the same old dream
If you but knew
How many times I pretend - that I'm with you
I'm sure your heart would unbend - you'd see me through

I'm on the ocean,
Guided by just a lonely heart!
