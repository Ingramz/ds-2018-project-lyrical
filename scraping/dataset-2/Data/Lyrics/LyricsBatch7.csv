Acceptance,"Oh no, this couldn't be more unexpected
And I can tell you I've been moving in so slow
Don't let it throw you off too far
Cause I'll be running right behind you

Could this be out of line? (Could this be out of line)
To say you're the only one breaking me down like this
You're the only one I would take a shot on
Keep me hanging on so contagiously

Oohhh, when I'm around you I'm predictable
Cause I believe in loving you with first sight
I know it's crazy but I'm hoping to..
To take a hold of you

Come to think of it, I'm aching
On account of my transgression..
Will you welcome this confession?

Stand up willing for the sake of sound
Stand up with it to throw it down
Stand up willing for the sake of sound

it's all so relative
But it's all that I can give
I don't seem to ever mind but it comes time after time
So long to sanity, ever since you came to me
But you always come to mind
If we will ever be what we used to be
You'll have to take what you find

stand up with it to throw it down
Stand up willing for the sake of sound
Stand up with it to throw it down
Stand up willing for the sake of sound

better believe what you see
I gave you ground on me
Better that you try to prove
You only get what you give

Accordeonistes Medinger,"1. D'un bout à l'autre de la s'maine
Sur les boul'vards, dans les faubourgs,
On les voit traîner par centaine,
Leurs guêtres sal's et leurs amours
Dans des chemises de dix jours,
Sous la lumièr' des réverbères
Prenant des airs de Pompadour,
Ce sont nos belles Ferronnières ;
Ce sont nos poupé's, nos guignols, nos pantins,
Ecoutez dans la nuit ell's chantent ce refrain :

R : C'est nous les mômes, 
Les môm's de la cloche,
Clochard's qui s'en vont
Sans un rond en poche,
C'est nous les paumées,
Les puré's d'paumées,
Qui sommes aimées
Un soir n'importe où
Nous avons pourtant
L'c?ur pas exigeant, 
Mais personn'n'en veut,
Ben tant pis pour eux,
Quéqu'ça fout,
On s'en fout,
Nul ne s'y accroche
Il n'y'a pas d'amour
Et l'on s'ra toujours
Les môm's de la cloche

2. Mais comme ell's n'ont pas les toilettes
Qu'il faut pour les quartiers rupins,
C'n'est pas aux gal'ries La fayette
Qu'ell's vont fair' chaqu' soir leur turbin :
Le long du Canal Saint-Martin,
Au Sébasto, à la Chapelle,
On est toujours assez grandin
Pour le Monsieur qui vous appelle,
C'est d'larticl' populair' c'n'est pas du beau joujou,
Y'a ps d'poupée en soie aux bazars à trent'sous

R : C'est nous les mômes,

Sans un rond en poche,
C'est nous les paumées,

Un soir n'importe où
Tout comm' nos ribouis
On n'est pas verni's,
Jamais l'on ira
Sur la Riviera
Quéqu'ça fout, 
On s'en fout,
Quand l'agent nous fauche,
On va fair' quatr' jours
Là-bas dans la tour,

3. Ell's ont vendu tout's leurs carresses
Ell's fur'nt payé's tant bien que mal,
Mais un jour plus rien dans la caisse,
Ell's vont se fich' dans le canal.
Et sans avoir comme un cheval
La pitié des gens de la rue
On les emporte à l'hôpital ;
La foule dit : ce n'est qu'un' grue,
Et voilà comment les poupé's, les pantins, 
Lorsqu'ell's n'ont plus le sou s'en vont tout's à Pantin.

R : C'est nous les mômes, 
Les môm's de la cloche,
Clochard's qui s'en vont
Sans ami, sans proche,
C'est nous les paumées,
Les puré's d'paumées,
Qui s'en vont dormir
Dans l'horrible trou
Derrièr' not' convoi
Jamais l'on ne voit
Ni fleur, ni couronne,
Mêm' pas un' personne

But Jesus stepped between the father and me 
Now the way that he sees his son

Oh, it's just as I

Verse 1: prodigy, a.c.d.

M-o-be-be d-e-e-p, a.c.d. burn sometin
Let's get lifted, queens is you wit me
Niggas' shifty, I turn around, a kid tried to hit me
I back him down wit the 50-50
It had to been the thug in me, ya tunnel bang and come and get me
The first five hundred bitches free
He kid with the God jewel and let all my gods come through
Live niggas on this side of the bar, you get smacked, boo
And fucked too, shit on me? well then, fuck you
Gone wit your high class ass if you want to
Outta state you be suckin me off and breakin off
Weed bitch stinks of stallion but my dick went soft
My mobb got in lock wit masterlock, het getcha locks picked
Run up in your spot, mask-n-glove shit
Queens niggas involved with thug shit, you get lumpded
Crank, we in the bathroom thumpin

To the three-time losers, alcohol abusers
Big money spenders and the ebineezer scroogers
Thugs holdin fort wit the sixteen shot rugers
The cream that I redeem will bring a lex and landcruiser
Dominant chapter, assassinin' the obsolete
And my mobb comes deep to put the wind beneath your feet
My heart's harder than concrete, and nervous streets
Be walked offbeat but still thugs carry heats
I get deeper than skin, paragraphs from within
Dear lord, my life is trife, please forgive for me sins
My kin stay my kin, ain't no room for extra friends
One love to my thugs up north in the pens
Be a prophet to raise, beat my speech on stage
Nemesis renegade, breakin down barricades
These days are gettin rough, 'nother brother handcuffed
Fallen victim to the gameis like style's corrupt

Them queen niggas livin - street life
My drug niggas livin - street life

You thug niggas livin - street life

Verse 2: havoc, a.c.d.

For every rhyme I write, reality bites
My clique keeps shit rolled too tight
Regulate and know the rule
I gets some insight plus info, do stickers with my kickos
My .44 will burn that ass like goin raw with nymphos
So protect your lifestyle, rock your vest
Or get your teflon put to the motherfuckin test
State pen put on points, son you know
Stay on the low, got the back, oh-no-no
When I'm on a dough blow, got ta guard you now
Kid, you wanna get foul, so now I gotta put that ass back on profile
Change your character, you ain't got stamina
Nigga get that dough, I ain't mad at'cha
The infamous handle business, gonna make mines
Forever, son, kid you heard it through the grapevine

To my royal thug commitees and outlaws that live the life of frank nitty
The big city mobster, the see-to-d ? ? ? ? has made the
God unholy, skies forever watch me
The prophecy, another chapter, there's no stoppin me
Propagation, my life story is far from fiction
'cause at one time, the .44 bullets took the world, bring sparks and friction
I anaylse this 'erb so I roll with trife characters
The hardest for the world to cap, and shiner like a
Full carat diamond with perfect designin
Philly's and 9 mili's and coupe de villey's forever reclinin
To the shoot, physicals in this paradox
The world is hot and my plot is to receive grands and yachts
Until then I be a trife individual, dwellin in these days
Scorch from the deeez plus the sun's rays
Dead president dreams and million dollar schemes
Killer queens, the land of cream fiends
A.c.d. the world terrorist
Stainless rugers for the intruders and my cipher's infamous
Through new york and worldwide, we penetrate your inside

Acda en De Munnik,"Op een terras, ergens in Frankrijk in de zon,
zit een man die het tot gisteren nooit won.
Maar z'n auto vloog hier vlakbij uit de bocht.
Zonder hem, zonder Herman, want die had hem net verkocht.

Herman in de zon op het terras,
leest in 't AD dat-ie niet meer in leven was.
Z'n auto was volledig afgebrand
en de man die hem gekocht had, stond onder zijn naam in de krant.

[chorus]
Oh-ho-ho, even rustig ademhalen,
oh-ho-ho, 't lijkt of het regent als altijd.
Maar het regent, en het regent zonnestralen.

Een week geleden in een park in Amsterdam,
had-ie z'n leven overzien en schrok zich lam.
Hij was een man wiens leven nu al was bepaald
en van al z'n jongensdromen, was alleen het oud worden gehaald.

[chorus]

Op een bankje, in het park, kwam het besluit.
Noem het dapper, noem het vluchten, maar ik knijp er tussenuit.
Nu een week geleden en hier zat ie dan maar weer,
met meer vrijheid dan hem lief was en nou wist-ie het niet meer.

Herman leest wel honderd keer de krant.
Het staat er echt, pagina 18, zwart omrand.
Hield-ie vroeger al zijn meningen en al zijn dromen stil,
nu is-ie niks, niet, niemand, nergens meer, 
kan dus gaan waar-ie maar wil.

Herman rekent af en staat dan op.
Hij heeft eindelijk de wind weer in z'n kop,
Ik heb een tweede kans gekregen en da's meer dan ik verdien.
Maar als dit 't is, is dit 't (3x)
en we zullen het wel zien.

Acda en De Munnik,"Vannacht lag ik weer wakker mam
Om alles wat ik niet weet
En voor niets had ik een oplossing
Behalve dan me reet
Niet dat het me niet interesseert
Maar wat weet ik er nou van
Soms dacht ik: 'stel nou dat...'
En dat was het wel weer dan
Vannacht lag ik weer wakker mam
Ben het bed maar uitgegaan
En alsof ik niet genoeg shit had
De radio aangedaan
De hele nacht de Beatles mam
En om elk uur dat woord
Het spijt me mam het spijt me zo

De zoon van god was terug op aarde mam
Zelfde boodschap zelfde haar
En All You Need Is Love, zo mooi
Maar kennelijk niet waar
Laat me slapen
Laat me slapen
Laat me slapen
Laat me slapen
Vanochtend toen de krant kwam
Heb ik de oplossing bedacht
En ik heb hem terug gegeven
Ik heb hem teruggegeven
Aan de jongen die hem bracht
En toen pas kwam ik langs die zin
Die wel de waarheid raakt:
'Het leven is wat je gebeurt
Terwijl je andere plannen maakt'
De zoon van god was terug op aarde mam
En Imagine was zijn woord
Dus de wereld is een paradijs

Ik kan die jongen toch nooit zijn
Die rust, die liefde, niets voor mij
Maar waarom lijkt het dan toch zo vertrouwd?

Maar ergens klopt er hier iets niet

Why do summers start in June

Lying and manipulating, did you get what you want?
Too bad your life is one big front

Ace & Quan,"But when it comes to
Protecting the lives of twenty-two million Afro-Americans
Then all of a sudden, Uncle Sam becomes very conscious, of legality

Here's the reason that, I've been upset for a while
'Cause if you're black you get life, but if you're white you're on trial
Ain't nothing to it, just like that chump Charles Stewart
They're always claiming, that the devil made me do it
For insurance, he killed his wife and his child
And blamed it on a brother, and racists got buck wild
He had the media, believing the, aesop fable
And all the whites were like, ""I can't wait 'til
They catch the bastard - I hope they fry him""
They were sure that he did it, there was no need to try him
And Willy Bennett, who was in it to win it
Got bassed and harassed cause they was sure that he did it
And the thing that really pissed me off and truly offended me
Is the suckers wanted to reinstate the death penalty
For a brother man, but not the other man
And when they found out, he killer her himself, hmm on the other hand
Now it's inhumane, bring it back they wouldn't dare
But his brother confessed he was with it, so give HIM the chair
But that won't happen with that punk Dukakis
Flynn and Mickey Roach, you better just watch for us
I don't want to hear that you're sorry to me
After you tore up, and started a war up in the black community
It's out of the news, but it's still in my head
Charles Stewart still lives even though the sucker's dead
I'ma speak upon it

He is trying to wipe, you, out
Trying to eliminate your total existence
With falsehood and lies
And he's succeeding in doing it!

Now here's a verse about a relative, that coulda lived
But killed by a cop that thought negative
Shot in the back like a victim of Jesse James
Tell them his motherf***ing name!
Phillip Pernell, murdered by a devil
That never saw a cell, so I'm here to raise hell and tell
About a child that was left to decay
And the next couple of days the pig was suspended with pay
Receiving support from cops and superior courts
And all we receive is a bullet inside a corpse
Now tell me, what type of justice has been done
What woulda happened if I shot his son?
I woulda been killed, taken to a chamber and filled up with gas
But yet nothing has happened to ?
So I had to take two extra steps
And put it on wax, cause I couldn't let it rest (why?)
'Cause I can't stand to see Satan smile
And get away with taking the life of a child
You meant to do it, so now your motto is (tell 'em)
The more bullets, the less blacks live (you better)
Watch your back you murderer because you're wanted
But for now, yo, I guess I gotta speak upon it

We've got to come together
Pool our efforts, our strength, our finance
And build our own nation
The Chinese did it, it's called Chinatown!

Let me speak upon this with a radical take as I take
Time to talk about the systematical break-down
And deliberate destruction through mis-education
Of the Nubian Nation
Starting in kindergarten, continuing through college
They continue to kick you trick knowledge
And call it education but I call it training
Washing your brain into gaining and maintaining
The American dream, but to me it's a nightmare
Because they keeps ya right where
They want you to be, mentally, physically, and monetarily
As you go merrily merrily merrily
Down the stream but it's more like up s***'s creek
Without a paddle and the boat's got a leak
We start drowning in all that s***, getting deeper
Mind's in a choke hold or should I say a sleeper
But I ain't going out like Rip Van Winkle
So you can't gas me up anymore, and I think you know
That I can see clearly now the rain is gone
It's bright outside, I see the light, and I'ma speak upon it

You know what I'm saying?
'Cause all that s*** they taught me in school amounted up to ZERO
(Word is bond!)
Abraham Lincoln ain't my motherf***ing hero, why know what I'm saying?
(That Devil ain't my hero neither)
Word up, yo this is Def Jef the poet with soul
Cooling with my man Eddie O.G.
On a funky funky funky funky funky funky track
(Yeah, Bulldogs is out there, why'knahmsayin?
ShaQuan, peace to you and Ace, why'knahmsayin?
Peace to Teddy Ted, Special K, DJ Doc, Ramos
Yeah boys, the soul brothers, why'knahmsayin?)
Oh yeah yeah, Craig B. ? Love and the Legend
And DJ Eric Vaughn, hah
(Word up)
Yeah

Notice this!
They put ""In God We Trust"" on a dollar bill
They don't even have it on a church
And don't even open the verses of their bible
But on the dollar bill is a big sign ""In God We Trust,"" correct?
Then they have, on the back of the dollar bill
The key, the scales, the pyramids
All of the symbols of bondage, slavery
How they took the country, who they took it from
Who you are, the builders of the pyramids
Without your eyes
You are the builders of the pyramids without your eyes
Because you don't know you did it
Why don't he know?
Because a traitor, taught him to eat wrong foods, since he was a baby
Put pork in him, has you eating pigs feet and ribs
Has you living in his image
And took away your divinity
And replacing it, with his low animalization",Speak Upon It,1991

How you pay to get in the club, and then hate on the pressure y'all pay to see
Now we got mob block live again
Look at these whips we're riding in
Making ball and look easy baby, we don't practice like... 
Sliding in I'm never super post when
I'm getting closer I'm just... the face

All the rappers start calling Mace,

Telling me it's a birthday, new shoes and her persuade, 
You should go appreciate the quire, I ain't the one you persuade, 
She ain't worried of the hotel, I wouldn't even get to motel, 
Mess around and take your girl from you then sell it to for the... 
Oh... have her back, wont' love but I love the stacks
So I'm pulling up and then you know what
They looking at me like what is that

Hold up, hold up, hold up,

Told Brad to send me a track, 
He send me a track to sound like a trap, 
I don't know normally do this, 
But hey when I do it sound like the trap, 
Competition left me in flat, I'm just hoping that you trap, 
I'm just hoping you try to try me, 
Get drag around by your suit tie, 
You can catch me in the forn city, 
They don't even know I rap, 
First album when platinum so they ain't many places on my map, 
Going golf in Iraq, going shopping in Dubai
She'll be asking the man forgives and gives me the gift form Dubai
Bottle water with a mouse trap, no rat can get to my cheese
Her... get no scraps get no bad like her ratches
Wanna book me for five G's, 
Read the sign and say stop please, 
Can't knock me, my trunk knocking, 
My making woman looking knock me, 
Call me but I'm unreachable, too trill to be speaker too
God loss in my own garage and they couldn't find me for a week or two, 
My trunk are open like pickable, 
Me I'm... to be sipping through, 
Came to blue, all my speakers blue, but I turn em up and my speakers do.

[Chorus]

Hold up man, just hold up man, 
Rap to state then pour down, 
Chew up cheese then throw up grants, 
Then guess some bread you know I'm jam, 
It's lunch time, she got one friend, but just one fine, 
One four, one dime, you already know which one is mine, 
Tripping like Jessy Jay, see love and got me in the... day
If it comes between hoes and dough I drop off chick and then scoop you pay, 
Might as well, I might as well, passing up dough is a major feel, 
Take the trip to South Africa, but can't lead the the paper like... pill, 
Realest rapper you have ever meet, she want n autograph on her fake breast, 
Too young is just too dumb, girl slow it down and take a break twist, 
Check it out when my lack is out, 
Don't worry bout it, I ain't stressed, 
Hot chocolate on my hallo tips they might mess around and get a taste test.

You've wrecked the life of a many poor girl
And you nearly spoiled this life of mine

You've made me break a many true vow

You've filled my heart with weary old blues
Now I'm walkin', talkin' to myself

Better not pout, I'm telling you why

He's got millions of stockings to fill on Christmas day

For one comand I stand and wait now

From one who's master of my Fate now
I can't escape for it's too late now

Those arms with me

Better ryders and roamers can't really ask 
""We going out T?"" ""Bitch I'm headed to the valley
So I'm out about to make some money
Pull up to a trailor wit about 800
Unload it I flip it get paid let's ride
Chunk a deuce to the guys and I'm back to Southside
Cruisin wit a couple of pines
Trying hard as hell to make it back to H-Town
Flippin but only make one stop
Then I'm buring out moving shit to a dope house
  
[9] - Cruisin to the valley checking up on me campos
Make thirty calls so I can wire free samples
Get me a plane so I can make my drops
Flying real low to avoid the cops
Weighing my weed on a digital beam
Wrapping it in a plastic quick so I can make my green
My windows are tinted so nobody sees in it
Wit mary jane and snow white the sky's the limit

Don't speed or trip when you see the lights

Collecting my lot not even sweating, back on 35

Transactions stacking paper rolls
The currency connect from Houston to the valley

Ace Diamond,"I get up in the evening
And I ain't got nothing to say
I come home in the morning
I go to bed feeling the same way
I ain't nothing but tired
Man I'm just tired and bored with myself
Hey there baby, I could use just a little help

You can't start a fire
You can't start a fire without a spark
This gun's for hire
Even if we're just dancing in the dark

Message keeps getting clearer
Radio's on and I'm moving 'round the place
I check my look in the mirror
I want to change my clothes, my hair, my face
Man I ain't getting nowhere
I'm just living in a dump like this
There's something happening somewhere
Baby I just know that there is

You can't start a fire
You can't start a fire without a spark
This gun's for hire
Even if we're just dancing in the dark

You sit around getting older
There's a joke here somewhere and it's on me
I'll shake this world off my shoulders
Come on baby this laugh's on me

Stay on the streets of this town
And they'll be carving you up alright
They say you gotta stay hungry
Hey baby I'm just about starving tonight
I'm dying for some action
I'm sick of sitting 'round here trying to write this book
I need a love reaction
Come on now baby gimme just one look

You can't start a fire sitting 'round crying over a broken heart
This gun's for hire
Even if we're just dancing in the dark
You can't start a fire worrying about your little world falling apart

If I could even talk
I should have known

By Tuesday my phone
Was ringing off the hook
So I'm comin' home

And sometimes
All you need in life is emergency
To take time and figure out what you're doing here

And it's a shame
To walk away from
From everything you know
From everything I want
And leave you here all alone, alone, alone

On Wednesday I'd leave
If I could get some sleep
I just sit and think

By Thursday I'd hope
It would feel more like home
But Friday falls 

And sometimes
All you need in life is emergency
To take time and figure out what you're doing here.

And it's a shame
To walk away from
From everything I know
From everything I want
And leave you here all alone, alone, alone
All alone
All alone
All alone
All alone

On Sundays I sit
And remember everything
'Cause now they're done.

There on a corner two strangers meet, in the night 
And then until the daybreak

Look in the alleys along the roads 
It's there the losers stand
There in the ring they bide their time 
Hustling what they can 
They beg just to get 
That bottle in their hand 

There in the night 
Somewhere in the night 
Oh how they do what they do 
Just to get through 
There in the night, in the night 

Then on the street in the heart of town 
A lady in black she turns around, in the night, yeah 
She stares at the man in the Cadillac 
He drives by but he'll be back for the night 
There in the night 

See the guy along the road 
Who can he be? 
Wait awhile he'll turn around 
See the man is me 
'Cause when I sing my dream 
My dreams will set me free 

There in the night 
Somewhere in the night 
Oh how they do what they do 
Just to get through 
There in the night, in the night 

When the sun goes down 
And the light grows dim 
Slowly move in for the kill 
If you would come back again 
It would take away this pain 
But I don't know if you ever will 

Love in the night 
Would feel so right

Ace Frehley,"It was back in the summer of '83
There's a reason I remember it well
I was slipping and sliding, drinkin' and drivin'
Bringin' me closer to Hell

And the Devil sat in the passenger's side
Of Delorean's automobile
He said, ""Hey Frehley, Frehley let's not be silly
There's a life out there to steal""

Rock soldiers come
And rock soldiers go
And some hear the drum
And some never know

Rock soldiers! How do we know?
Ace is back and he told you so.

With a trooper in the mirror
and Satan on my right
We went the wrong way down a one way road
Hitting everything in sight

I cried ""I am invincible""
Said I was high above the law
But my only high was just a lie
And now I'm glad I saw

Rock soldiers come
And rock soldiers go
And some hear the drum
And some never know

Calling rock soldiers
You! Rock soldiers
Calling rock soldiers
hard rock soldiers

Friends say they'll stay with you
Right through that danger zone
But the closer you get to that fiery hole
You'll have to make it alone

When I think of how my life was spared
From that near fatal wreck
If the Devil wants to play his card game now
He's gonna have ot play without an Ace in his deck

And rock soldiers go
And some hear the drum

Just like those things under the bed 
A fear you know when younger, 
Sometimes, made up in your head

But it ain't no apparition, 
Won't pull things down into the rug 
You wish that you could wake up 
But both pinch and the pin, they draw blood 

(And) something moved, it's out there 
Someone knows you're there 

Your eyes are dead and broken 
Fixed in a stare without a blink 
You see but don't believe it 
Like a whine swearing off a drink 

You live in fear for daybreak 
Some warmth and comfort from the sun 
All sense of time escapes you 
'Cause when you look up at the clock, it's only one

Someone knows you're there",Something Moved,1987

About to drive me half wild

It makes me tingle inside, so gimme more, gimme more

I'm a stranger in a strange land 
I'm not afraid of it, kinda like the taste of it

I'm not abusing it, girl, because I'm choosing it!

I'm not afraid of it, want a little more of it 

It's only ten o'clock 
Really fell the need to rock 
I think I got it now 
No one has to show me how 

I'm feeling more at home 
I don't feel the need to roam 
Everything is in the right place 
So gimme more, gimme more 

[Chorus]

When the feeling is right, there's no need ot fight

With a challenge in your eye 
Darin' me to knock you out of your seat

Now if its rock and roll you came for 
It's rock and roll you're gonna get, ya!, ya!

I've seen old men crying at their own grave sides
And I've seen pigs all sitting watching

Do ya want my face
Do ya want my mind

As they sat and sang auld lang syne by the light
Of the moon
I heard the preacher bangin' on the drums
And I heard the police playin' with their guns
But I never heard nothing like you
In the country where the sky touches down
On the field she lay her down to rest
In the morning sun
They come a runnin' just to get a look just to
Feel to touch her long black hair they don't
Give a damn

Do ya want my face
Do ya want my mind
Do ya want my love

I know it's crazy, but it's true.
One plus one, is one.
And that one is me and you.

It's mathematics.
You know the score.
When you talk about you and me,
It all adds up to something more.
No complications.
No compromise.
No need to stop to figure it out.

When you're this united,
You can't be divided.

No calculations.
No little lies.
But we just can't hold off the power of love,
The joy just multiplies.

This love is total.
This love is right.

There is no subtraction,
From a real attraction.

Ho' hold up, double M back in this bitch
Walk in the club with a MAC on my hip

I got a bag full of tools and some yay to move
And all I want is money, leave the fame to you
I graduated out of gladiator school
So all I know is go like I'm trained to do (Turn up!)
Right now, turn my Mazy pedal to the metal I'm ashin' out
I let the top down in my Phantom drop
Blowin', I'm high as an astronaut
When you see me, I'm cashin' out
Walked into Mercedes bought half the lot
You keep carrying on, you getting carried out
Cause I don’t take ass whoopins, just pass ‘em out
Is this worth getting blasted about?
No forreal, is it worth getting blasted about?

Money conversation
Get so high, I be scrapin'
Got my eyes like a Asian
In my ride, like I'm racin'
In the sky, like a plane
It's Gang or die
Ain't no lames up in my circle
Ain't no ho shit in my eyes
Throwin' money in the air
Poppin' bands and let it fly
Where I'm from, you come up short
Pull that thing and let it fly

We gon' have to weigh that money, too much profit pilin'
I just love to stunt on all my old hoes
I do not fuck with that bitch, she cannot keep her legs closed
I'm runnin' the game, I'm fuckin' them lames
Forrealla, forreal, that head was insane
But all of these niggas be frontin'
All of my niggas be stuntin'
Livin' this life and we love it
We gettin' this money, I keep it 100
Say I, don't fuck with these niggas
I say, now I, ain't lovin' these bitches
Cross my heart and hope to die

We don't fuck with you, we don't fuck with you
(We don't fuck with you, nigga)
We don't fuck with you, we don't fuck with you
(We don't fuck with you, nigga)
You can't sit with us, you can't hit the blunt
Just to tell the truth, we don't fuck with you

(We don't fuck with you, nigga)
We don't fuck with you, we don't fuck with you
We don't fuck with you, we don't fuck with you
You can't sit with us, you can't hit the blunt

But we immune to lose it,
Hey,
Hey,

[Chorus]
I can't stop getting this money now,
Cause I'm out here living this hustlers life.
I be working all day but no 9 to 5,
And you know we don't play when it's time to grind. That's how it goes,
You wanna get that dough.
I'm making it but I'm still hungry,
But whatever it takes I gotta go get this money.

When I first jumped in the game I was 7 years old,
Drop a model get the money, give a fuck about a ho.
Servin' porcelain to people left a brick up in my coat,
Always told to eat fast,
Never snitching was the code.
I would never post pone cause the money get gone,
Never waiting by the phone gotta get it on your own.
Real niggas get paid every second of the day,
Hit the mall blow a quote that I can't fit in this phrase,
Just know it's two colors in that Def Jam chain,
Lil money wanna scam,
Bitch I'm outta your range.
Make way,
Feed me,
Gotta get this money.
Smoking nothing but the best yeah the boy so flooded, and I still want money...

[Chorus]

See niggas shut down,
My money keeps coming.
You niggas take breaks,
My team keeps running.
They bring me back bags,
Louis vitton something.
Don't really know the price,
Just know it costs money,
And when it comes to money,
They know it ain't nothing,
Throw a 100 on jewels,
Make it back up on a Monday.
Why niggas trying floss,
They balling outta budget.
Everyday on the grind,
Bitch my mind is on my money.
Tell 'em roll up the trees,
And deliver me the scummy.
Forget a 9 to 5,
Overrated me to quit.
Now a day since legit,
I get it opposite legit.
Me and my nigga 'Kon so addicted to the chips.
He gon let you know the script

[Chorus]

And whatever it takes,
Ace Hood bout money.
How much for the chain?
I spend bout a 100.
See you can dim the lights,
But my wrist still sunny.
They know I'm on the block,
And my fitted in the glock.
Dickies cut with a frame,
And a half up in my sock,
Gotta get it anyway,
And keep it level from the cops.
Bitch I never play the grind,
First rule off top.
I been in it for the dough,
You niggas need props .
I'm just in it for the guap,
100 million in the pot.
Only know to go get it
So the printer don't stop.
Grab 50 hit a lot,
And go and dump it on the drop.
I'm starving like Marvin,
It ain't no give and barging, like target.

Rippin' on that steering wheel, passenger's a duffel bag
Hundred in the Louie, don't confuse me with that other cat
Engine in the truck jack, pushing like a super pack
Automatic button pad just to keep the top back
Ruby red insides, Lamborghini fruit snacks
Twenty-two, that's what I shoot, you know them bitches got a mack
Back to the back of the lac incase them pussy niggas wanna jet
Know I keep that .45, turn you into Cabbage Patch
Hit you right between the eyes then leave you like an alley rat
100 for the bracelet, a track, I'm like a magnet
Hit 'em with that gutta swag, swangin' with the Louie rag

Yes, I keep that .45, you better keep a body guard
Benz is in the parking lot so you know the block is hot
Tell em we don't give a shit and mother fuck the other side

Open up the suicide doors, call it homicide

Had to blow the brains out, yeah I keep it ruthless
Know you niggas mad but tell em haters I does it
Better quit that fussing, don't know what's in the bull pit
.45's a motherfucker, hit you and your cousin
Think I gave a damn but I never gave a fuck
Got that oven heated up and bitch you looking like lunch
Take them heaters to your gut like it's a million uppercuts
Then I dip off in the cut and throw it up, who give a fuck?
Got that vodka in my cup, bring my gangsta to the front, what's up?

Ace Hood,"[Chorus]
Take a look at me now, 
I'm from the gutta but I made it, 
I made it to the top of the world,
Nothing holding me down, 
I told them haters I would make it, 
I made it to the top of the world

Congratulations all you fakers as you see I graduated, 
Here's a favor for you haters, kiss my anus boy, 
I made it out the ghetto, I made it out the gutta, 
But still I keep the street and now I'm hot as every summer. 
They said I couldn't do it, but who are they to call, 
I started rapping and ended chances of playing ball. 
And now the doubted, but young is sprouting above them all, 
Straight out the ? county gutta skipping menopause. 
No homo I keep it solo but I will never fall, 
Now every call I get the money is so involved, 
2 stacks of better is easy cheddar to hit the mall. 
I get the money to throw em so every day I ball,

[Chorus]

And yes I made it, you cant mistake it, 
I know they hate it, 
They see my face in the paper next to they rapping favorites, 
I am so amazing I am no one like I'm in the matrix. 
And I made it mama, and don't stress your problems I'ma get us out the, 
Forget the drama that people holla just follow godda. 
And he will lead you right through the problems I promise mama, 
And I swear that to the day I parish, 
Tell em Khaled I will bury every necessary cat who said I wouldn't homie. 
Look at me now yea I'm laughing at you non believers, 
Screaming gutta while I'm balling err fucking season, 
I use to pass my CD me and four fifth in 80, 
I use to bag em to listen but they were not believing, GO

[Chorus]

And as I rap I create a classic, 
Who would imagine, 
That I would inherit all the traits to be the greatest homie, 
The world is mine and everything, lets get the money, 
See tony Montana said it best, 
Yes it's quoted truly, so add this song to your list of greatest and classic movies, 
And I'ma roll the credits, just in second, 
Just get this message, shout out to everyone who supported me from past to present, 
And I wanna thank khaled because without him there will be no sessions, 
And I wanna thank fam cause wit them they taught me this lesson, 
And I wanna thank god cause without him there will be no message, 
And I wanna thank all of my fans cause they are a blessing, this for BET reference, 
I got my speech ready,

Understand I'm the man who you can't match
Money man minivan full of brown bags
Better grand any man never top that
Cause money and the gat pop those straps
Getting loot in the top drop right back
I ain't playing creep ya avenue and I'll blast
Bust shots like a new year day blast
And I ride all day like a buss pass
Grinding hard for the bread and the cash flow
Kick doors wave 4's where the cash go (where the cash go)

Ace Hood,"It's so incredible
Yeah, it's the DJ Khaled, Khaled, Khaled
I do this for the projects
I got the mothafucking gutta on this track
I got the projects on this one

You have no idea why you started
But guess this is your final warning
And boy, we don't care who you calling
Nothing can save you now

Shotta youts will run up in your apartment
So unno betta mind where you walking
Goddamn man, can to your target
Nothing can save you know

See you dun push the wrong button
And cross the wrong line
Stepped on the wrong shoe
Muthafucka, it was mine

Time and time
They get me out the tandem
Me are da true, I traded mine in
For caveman king

You don't wanna fuck with
The Southside Gotcha boys
Y'all ain't know trill ass niggas
Y'all some boxy boys

And pull shots on boys
Scattered like a roach
And put that on the fifth
I'm the nigga you don't wanna approach

I was raised in the heart of the jungle
The belly of the beast
And this lick here sweet, I'm so flawed
You can put me on the front line
Ass back nicks, I don't represent the gun shy
Thing about the street life

Homie, I live, wear my heart on my sleeve
And niggas gotta fear life
From the bottom to the top, east to the west
All I gotta say is Khaled, nigga we the best

You have no idea why you started
But guess this is your final warning
And boy, we don't care who you calling
Nothing can save you now

Yo, bdah, bdah, bdah
Khaled, go let me see 'em
Hand me the fucking clever
'Cause I got a fucking fever
For all the evil Kinevel people
Who try to stunt

Call me Danny Glover
I'm lethal this ain't no sequel
Shoot you people while you sleeping
The grim reaper is out to lunch
Nothing can save you now

Put holes in you mouth so you can't be found
And Khaled got my back
He gon' shoot a hundred rounds
So say hello to death
If you ever in my town

I came from the eggs of a goddess
And the balls of a gigolo
All I had was 2 ounces
An old Chevy and Figaro
Blood shed apart my feet

And bad vibes got a nigga rocking voodoo deep
Lord forgive me, I know not a better way
And pop has tried to stick me
Damn I need some better ye

Ring the alarm, tell 'em people come, come
Look at what the fuck the Briscgun, yeah
It's the final warning

Khaled, these niggas talking
I'm an orphin
And leave a hole in his head
Like a dolphin
Fuck a hole in one, ain't golfin'
I'ma put his whole unit in a coffin

'Cause any nigga fuck wit my pocket
I'ma open his ass off, like suicide doors
Any badass niggas, y'all scared of that lake
I'ma tell you once don't be scared of the Dre

You have no idea why you started
But guess this is your final warning
And boy, we don't care who your calling
Nothing can save you now

I'm usually cool, but know I gotta bet back
I tried telling ya, ain't wit'cha death threats
I let my nigga know, tell 'em go hammer that
And it ain't gon' take all day
We know where you live at

I'll bet ya hide from ya neighbors
Keep 'em mad shawty
That's how we kill 'em babies
Holla Khaled, and tell him I'm on the way now
I just had to hit a lick in the A-Town

Look at me it's shawty
So bossy, and I don't feel like that
Can't stop me now, now, now
You see what's happening?
Big shit dun popped off
I'm the best nigga, you can ask Khaled
I'm the best nigga

You have no idea why you started
But guess this is your final warning
And boy, we don't care who you're calling
Nothing can save you know

Shotta youts will run up in your apartment
So unno betta mind where you walking
Goddamn man, can do your target
Nothing can save you know

But my heart get cold as the hood I'm from
Tell me what it take to be number one

Glasses in the air, and this for history.

True story I was born into the Lord's glory, 
Hustlin' of their visions, to first class ported, 
And that's accordin' and I was corgile on my first formal, 
Tryin' make a mill' comin' off a four quarters, I am so Florida, 
Marlin in my own water, swimin' with' the sharks slaughter anything by them, 
Feelin' like an orphan never knew my real father, 
Guess that's why I'm goin' harder than my role model,

People that I wanna meet, and places I've been diein' to see, 
No hope in sellin' coke or dope I'm goin' back to sleep, 
Now lie awake with paper bags cash under feet, 
Throw up the W to represent my dynasty, 
And all honesty the prodigy see no defeat, 
Keep all apologies the modesty is all to me, 
It's ruthless mind frame is the way to be, 
I burn a hater blow the ashes on his daddy feet, 
May he be deceased lookin' 'til you see the peace, 
Well I could see you gettin' rich 'cause niggas envy me, 
It's deeper than a rap the realest shit a nigga speak, 
Private planes take me everywhere they wish to see, 
And Khaled takin' me to heights they only wish to be, 
Flyest without a wing, the American dream, 
It's a bird, it's a plane, naw it's just me.

You know I love you girl

College girl she was a Florida State Seminole 
Had a job at the mall workin' ten to fo'
Hella fine I ain't lyin' y'all don't hear me though
So I'm walkin' right up to her, hey my name Ace
She replied with a smile and said her name's Shea 
Very conservative, i luv that
Fitted jeans, rockin' J's and a snap-back 
Yeah but I can see that she would kill a girl 
See you hidin' that physique, you better get it girl 
And you the shit but she don't' know yet 
Turnin' red got her blushin' where your mama at
Cause all I wanna do is thank her 
I'm using beautiful and gorgeous in the same verse
I swear I'm trippin you just got me open 
And hope we can get acquainted what I'm highly hopin'

And I just hope this got you motivated 
That's cause your body got me cultivated 
Seeing your fine ass alone I just can't tolerate it
And all your friends say I'm a dog every conversation 
Mad cause you smiling more on a daily basis 
Tell me why they hating everything's accommodated
I'm just searching for your love but I'll be very patient 
True story had a thing before we started dating 
Say she never heard beautiful so many times 
Silly guys approaching with all wrong lines 
That's a reason for being a single a long time 
And all the roses I sent you pleasure was all mine 
Yeah women are beautiful in many ways

Ace Hood,"StrugglE in my past, pain in my expressions
Running on my last, avoid the deep depressions
Beefing with the bottom, I'm so afraid of fallin'
And all these fucking problems turning me into an alcoholic
Where did I go wrong, I swear this can't be life
Seventeen and pregnant that just can't be right
In love with a man who fucking your friend depends on what you like

(This bitter earth)

This world is crazy, hate that my babies gotta receive the sight
Just ask the lord to give me the strength so they believe what's right
And not some smooth nigga who trying to get her home tonight
Invest in a gun, and hope that the thug who comes just ain't her type

It's a cold world, keep your sweater close
Made it big but seems like family the ones who hate the most
That's a damn shame, how dare you doubt your blood
Don't know my real father, how come he drop my love
Why when I'm all alone, that there's no one to hug
He left me all alone, how could you leave your cub
But fuck it I'm a man, with or without your ass
They ask about my pain, some things I wish that I had
Just thank the man above, my moms considered my dad
She working and spending her last, whatever we wanted we had
The struggle created a man, no longer your job demands
No thoughts of contraband, I've failed and let's replan
I've been through hell and back, but still I'm here to stand
Mama need a house, so fuck it I bought some land
Dying to be the greatest, but greater comes with patience
Got my business right, and plus my mama good
Worked my hardest just to say I made it out the hood
You fucking right, bitter world
Cried a hundred tears when I seen my baby girls
When I see my baby girls, damn

Blood, sweat, and tears, this my testimony
Just know the world is yours, ain't that right, Tony?
Gas prices high, niggers die young
Bad role models, that's what that came from
That's what that came from

(This bitter earth) 
My god
(Well, well) 
My god 
(Well, this bitter earth, well)

Dear world, dear world, I need you undivided
And know some choices that we made were highly undecided
We keep it mind, we giving them signs, at times that's disregarded

(This bitter earth, well)

Ah, some live in the blind afraid of the light,
But pain just can't be departed
The things that I seen I wish it was dreams' it seems I'm sleeping hardly
Lost a lot of homies, endured a lot of pain
Pray for better nights, slowly they became
I hear my phone ring, fuck who calling me
I just hope that it's success who trying to bother peace
Fuck this bitter world, with no apologies
Babies having babies, what could your father be
Sick of being tired, and tired of being broke
Mama worked too hard I pray ' no signs of stroke
Microphone and words, clearly show me hope
Without it I'm alone, clearly you should know.",Bitter World,2011

Before I start kiss my ass, X O's
Ahem, okay let's talk about a gold digger
Met her at a video shoot, go figure
Uh, well she was bad than a mothaflicker
Seen her lookin' got her number seen what's up wit her
Yeah, to make a long story short dawg
Couple days I'm sleepin, beatin' the inner walls
Fell in love with it now we up in every mall
Bought her first Louis bag, she was so appalled
Not a scout but she love to watch a nigga ball
Bought her everything she had if I could recall
So couple months I got her moving in
That show money got me out of town
It got her trippin' when I'm not around
She was movin, trying to play a nigga out of bounds
Seen pictures of her and niggas I hate to found
Sad part was the bitch was trickin' off out of town
Uh, and I was too blind to see it sooner
Knew this bitch was kinda fishy like some old tuna
Took her clothes and threw em in to an old sewer
Damn, you shoulda' really seen her face then
Uh, she officially on my shit list
Uh, She pulled up on some shock shit
Uh, I'm talkin bags in the front trick

You tried to play me like a band bitch
But I ain't trippin' cause you're pussy kinda average

Shit, we were the worst to put your money on
Damn, in the beginning it was fairy tales
I'm talking make believe love coated in make believe
Uh, but that's until I started buying things
It was cool, now she started wantin wedding rings
Such a drama queen demanded all kinda things
Corrupted buy the light, she could only see the green
Wanted kids so I can be there by any means
Let her tell it we were something like a perfect team
Damn, had to cut it, she was out of order
Tryin to put me on blast like a bill boarder
Yeah, I called her momma tried to transport her

""Did you throw out her out dawg""

Yeah kinda sorta, she was mad so she filing a restraining order
Just to come and get her bags in the trash house
Swear the cops made me leave nearly passed out
Hey but I end up moving back in
Oh my momma, now she preggo with a set of twins
Pause, ""That's a whole lot to settle in""
Uh, I guess the story really never ends
Well here's a letter to my ex then
I swear she used to be my best friend
Now she's a memory from back then
I know she prolly misses that fifth
Big sprees, and them motherfuckin plane trips
And she the last on my ex list
Nearly had a nigga stressed

Damn

Somebody tell me what's love
What's your definition of love?
Is love buying one another different gifts
""Depending on the price tag.""
Is that love?
I mean a nigga just looking for somebody genuine
To really ride for him
I'm feelin' like ""fuck love,""
They don't give a damn about me anyway
Maybe relationships ain't for me
I guess that's why I'm writing this

Dear lord I am on my knees and I'm begging please 
Just guide me father this time I'm really in need 
Feeling like I just can't go on, mama cryin' and she lost her home 
Tears runnin all down her face, judge gave her ten days to be gone 
My god what I'm gon' do now, so stressed that the day go by 
Devil on me and I don't know why , beg mama just please don't' cry 
Times get a little rough I know, when it come to givin' up I don't 
Got twins and they on their way, see 'em starve in the bed I won't
Sometimes I ask myself would I be a good father 
'Cause I've never had mine, would I give the world to my daughters 
Live and you learn, reap what you sow

He helped what I never could find, reach out when I couldn't get a dime
Man only lord knows, lord knows, lord knows 
Man only lord knows what the hell I dun' really been through  
All the nights my mama couldn't move 
And all the pain I dun' put her through 
Man only lord knows 

And I'm sick and tired of this pain 
Hate the lames in this game only down because of my name 
Rock Swiss because of my fame
Lord knows the road where I came, lord know the nights that I cried
Can't help the pain that's inside, lord wipe the tears from my eyes 
Ever seen the letter of eveiction, no place to go but you wishin
That a blessing come and you lifted, yeah dog that's all in my vision
I dun' been through hell and them trenches, I dun' seen the best of them fall
Lost a couple of my dogs, miss them niggas like shit 
But they still reside in my heart, sore, ached and I'm scarred

Blood, sweat and tears, I really live this shit

And everyday that I wake, I grind, no time never wait for mine
Still waiting on the day I shine my soul, every bar, every line
I remember when I had no food, lights off, bills overdue
Lord knows that I've paid my dues, won't forget when I got that news 
They say my mama sickly thank god she seen her fifties
I pray and ask forgiveness, please lord just keep her with me
I was down and out, remember that like yesterday
Made it out that struggle bracket, this year I'm blessed to say
Man this world's so fucked up, gas prices are way too high
Time's hard and I ain't gon' lie, bust ass just to try and get by
So who the hell is y'all to be judging, made it away from literally nothing

Ridin' round in that bubble ? for drama
Man I put that on my life that's my muthafuckin' dog
Anything want problems that's the nigga I will call
Just know he comin' runnin' with that shit that'll clear the mall
Young and thugging he bustin' if you ever playin foul
Me and four fifth were brothers, felt like we dun' done it all
Then one day in the studio is when I got the call
Man it was o' nine when I lost my dawg
And still to this day the tears continue to fall
I love my nigga, see the pain still remain
Know you watchin' from heaven how far that your nigga came
So I tatted your name to show you I'll never change
Progress the aim ?

[Chorus]
Don't give a damn about 
Got a few haters so the tool on tuck
Got a small circle, all we ask is trust
Me and my dogs, and all we got is us
Pour a lil' liquor, forget about the pain
A lot of niggas in the dirt, so the sky's where we aim
But now we got the money, the power and the fame
Shit done changed, now we ridin' down memory lane
It's just me and my dogs and we ridin' down memory lane
Memory lane, we in that all white Range
It's just me and my niggas and we ridin' down memory lane
Down memory lane, and we just ridin' down memory lane

And I just gotta keep it real I'm telling you how I feel
Talking before the deal when I was back in the field
'Member we used to chill ? me and my nigga Dale
He attending the school a student at full sale
We visited his crib a couple days and we bail
Hit a couple of clubs and then a couple of girls
God damn my nigga them the mufuckin' Dades
Lord just tell me why you had to take my dog
They just wanted this car, they just wanted to ball
He just wanted to leave, frightened by what he saw
I was off in the room awaiting my nigga call
Not knowing that's the last time that we would even talk
I told 'em to be safe and sent them deuces to my dog
A couple hours later got an unexpected call
My homie he was crying, I knew that it was bad
He told me Dale gone, you're lying out your ass
I called his cell phone but nobody hittin' back
They say that he was shot, dyin' to make it out
He died on the scene that's when I hit my knees
Begging the Lord please, heavenly Father please
So listen to a dream, tell me how could it be
Probably because of me, I'm who he wanted to see
Man a couple years ago is when I lost my dog
And still to this day the tears continue to fall
I love my nigga, see the pain still remain
Know you watchin' from heaven how far that your nigga came
So I tatted your name to show you I'll never change
Put that shit on my chain, our bond is like a stain

[Chorus]

Gone but never forgotten

Pray for a better life
Just to see me through them tougher nights

Spoke to my mama just the other day
I told her only God can make a way
I'm hearin' tears they runnin' down her face
She fed up with the struggle each and every day
My step pops he be in the way, too many bills my mama gotta pay
But know I got us no doubt about it on granny's grave

And now they sweat me line Under Armours and Gatorade

I know they all remember me you recognize the name
I was that nigga being humble counted out the game
Now I'm that nigga still humble carryin' the flame
And everybody said I wouldn't take a walk a shame
Though about you haters when I copped my pinky ring

I got wit Khaled all the nigga do is win
See we the best, nothin' less
It's war time hope you niggas brought a vest
Got plenty women, from that Penicillin
Fuck 'em on that Gucci linen she comin' in minutes
No love intended I'm just tryna wet the willie
They freed my nigga Jockey posed to have did a life sentence 
I'm from the bottom, came from the mud
Was given nothing, no love, now I'm beat mode, no hugs
Back again, sure 'nuff
I'm the definition of blowin' up
Look in my niggas eyes better know it's on us
You better know it's on us

I'm like Jordan to you niggas
I might even stick my tongue out
She wiggled and wobble, bobbled
Then landed on my throttle
Bitch, I might make you my baby
And even buy you a bottle
Yo niggas don't ask how the top feel?
When you keep em' right beside you
My pockets got paper on paper
This shit just look like a novel boy
100 thousand worth of ice on me now
But it don't feel half as good
As grandma saying she's proud

Forever dedicated, Maybach poetic genius
Some think they close to seeing me
Tell em they close to Stevie

But I got the best palette
Multiple colors, my mind's more productive than others
Murray the winner, he think he really
Nelson Mandela
That's fire though.
One time for the 305, though
That hydro make me tired, yo
My kickin be so Tai Bo!
My balance be so tight rope
That's hard to find Quick Tri-Flow
Get rough With me, that Night flow
Hoes blow for me, I maestro, shit
That white whip sit
Like a slight wrist slit
Suicide shit, you can by shit if you write this shit
Nigga and right this minute, they say I'm buzzing hard
My driver's out of this world, you playing bumper cars.
You niggas under-cards
You should be unemployed
All you smoke is Reggie, I'm in the telly bunch of noise
Who gon' tell me that I ain't going or I ain't flowin'
Young Folarin, you see them puters
That was my influence

The towers fell, turning to Ground Zero
Kids didn't like Reggie Jackson
Nicki Barnes their hero
As I play Rothstein, Corleone like Rob De Niro
Been through it but here though
Don't move with the weirdos
Dress pimpin' the toast like let's win
Penthouses on West and 4th, pipes and Mac 6
While me in a Maserati bricking his best friends
When I die, tell them to turn my coffin to stretch Benz rims on it
Problems? My man's on, see him, we stomp him out
His mouth, our Timbs' on it
Always smoking a ounce, a mountain, no tens on it
Spins on it, you have no clout, the Benz on it
What the fiends say?
Few roaches, you need spray, on tours, eat straight
Making sure all your feet sprayed
Get the pills through, peel through SRT-8 truck on, seats gray
Drop tops like release dates, Vado",Future,2011

Yea, yellin’ fuck a 9 to 5 boi

I’m self made, self paid and I got my city watching
They threw me in the game
I threw up numbers like an auction
‘Cause I do it, do it, do it
Like it’s no other option
Fat asses, big bottles
When I’m around they both get poppin’
I talk about girls and money
Too much I admit, way too much girls
Too much money, those 2 things that don’t exist
And I think It's so impressive I’m riding in the back
Young and black ’cause I’m chauffeured and not ’cause I’m arrested
Getting richer every year, you can grasp up my progression
Got the finest with her shirt off and skirt off
Showing her blessings

Man I’m so blessed (I’m so blessed)

I wonder what the haters got to say now
They mad I’m on top of my game and they down
I’m always repping for my gang I stay down
Ain’t gotta go back to my hood ’cause they 'round
And the niggas that’s next to me it’s all the niggas that stress with me
I done made it from the bottom and they say I did it on my own
So to me that’s destiny
If anybody got a problem I just tell ‘em to get on their grind
Try to to see as much checks as me
And my wife is a goddess my tree is the finest
A click full of real niggas that's just the one thing about us
They showin’ us love, but I remember back then the niggas would doubt us
We used to go out but now when we go out all the people surround us
They screaming my name, I’m repping my city it’s me who they proud of
So fuck what the lames about wouldn't me no game without us no game without us

Man I’m so blessed (I’m so blessed)
I got the Lord on my shoulders

Now sing it with me
If you’ve been working hard
If you believe in God
Sing it with me
Can nothing stop me now

Been hated on, I been doubted
Been talked about and mistreated
Still put in the work that I needed
Now I’m living the things that I’m dreaming
Got my mama straight and my daughter good
And my team right ’cause we eating
Been broke before and now its open doors
I got the dopest flow and they seen it
God keep away all them demons
Been patient dog I’ve been lenient
Been holding out I’ve been fiending
Long as God with me don’t need ‘em
When you winning everybody want a dap up
Gettin' money now your friends wanna act up
I don’t really give a fuck I’ma go hard
No stress, couple cars in the front yard
We the best be the logo, getting money with a mogul
Upgrade from the 2 to the 4 door
Top down so blast it, its yolo
One time form the XO

I come to you today
To remove all these evil spirits
Keep us out of harm’s way
Never allow us to die broke

I pray for them children who woke up this morning and lost they life
How dare the government passin’ these laws to remove the Christ
As soon as a tragedy happen the person you call is God
Now people obeyin’ and prayin’, they prayin’ I’m sayin’ it’s odd
Fuck the world – the government too
I’m keepin’ it real, them killers are stealin’ political suits
And I hate it, it’s people, it’s nothin’ my brother or sister could do
But sit back and pray as we watchin’ the news and we take the abuse
What train of thought is tellin’ you shoot up a movie theatre?
What kind of fool gon’ walk in a school and off them angels?
It could me my moms, my brother or sister, a friend that I knew
The funny thing is, it could’ve been me, it could’ve been you
I’m tired of people complainin’ about the little shit
When I just lost my grandmother to that cancer bitch
You woke up this morning – why the fuck is you mad?
You broke as a joke – get up off your ass
I hustle like niggas is broke even though I be countin’ the cash
I gotta get it – like I’m down to my last
Put that on my mama, don’t wanna go through them tears again
‘Cause when you are broke, it’s nobody there, including your friends
Lord knows… the realest shit I ever wrote
But through all the bullshit I throw up a sign of hope…
But through all the bullshit I throw up a sign of hope

Fuck the world, the government too
I’m keepin’ it real, them killers are stealin’ political suits
And I hate it, it’s people, it’s nothin’ my brother or sister could do
You can hate it or love it, but youngin’ I’m simply speakin’ the truth

I woke up this morning and I got the news that my homie was shot
Out on the block and in front of his daughter, believe it or not
Good people are sayin’ and prayin’ for innocent murders to stop
We livin’ in Hell and it’s easy to tell some people are sharks
Who are you people to judge me ‘cause of the way that I live?
The weight of that crime, the things that I did, the person I am
Everyone got opinions but niggas as broke as a joke

And all people who are just like you
No matter what they say about me
I'mma do whatever I gotta do

This is the come up
Where niggas hustle from night to sun up
The gutta, where niggas run up and they get done up
And mama tryna make a dollar for son and daughter
Where them times are even harder without a father
Want a job but never bother
All about them commas, bigger diamonds and high designer
With all the finest women, goddess
With perfect bodies that we admire
This is the come up where niggas do whatever for money
They'll murk a nigga now and got to church on a Sunday
Probably snitch on homeboys and take a flight out of country
It's fucked up, the motive is to get out the hood
Get your mama new crib, keep your family good
When that money is pouring and them jewels is shining
And them cars are foreigns, them haters praying it storm
It's no love, it ain't a place for the weak
Only strong survive, only hustlers ride

And dreams are never seen, 'cause they don't believe in it.
And it seems you can achieve by any means go and get it
Anything you vision and anything you wishing
You can live it just bare the witness
They said i wouldn't and i did it
What God intended
From being labelled as a menace, to counting millions
My daughter smiling every minute, I'm in attendance oh lord
I got my deal in the field, cried hundred of tears
Feeling like that dough boy who hit a lick for a mill
Riding round with that work
Know them weapons concealed
If them feds ever catch 'em
He'll do 200 hundred years for that dope
And I know money come money go in the fame in the game
All the hate that it brings many lost some gave never changed
Not me, gotta survive everyday
Know every morning I wake I'm tryna come up

Even though I couldn't really afford it.
Who's to say I can't be an Obama,
A Tiger Woods worth about a billion dollars?
Everybody wanna sell a little coke,
'Cause its cool to them niggas you know.
Don't nobody wanna be another judge.

Seen some friends who turned into snakes
I ain’t never took for granted no days

Rack up a millie then do it again

If I got jammed up and did a little time
Would you still be the woman who gon' hold it down
Through the hard times
And the cloudy days
Would you stand strong?
Would you run away?
All the bullshit, and all the heartache
She still ridin' with a nigga since the first day
Her ambitions of a rider
She would be around if I never had a dollar
She would be my nurse if I ever need a doctor
Bonnie and Clyde, she never side with the coppers
Never break code, forever be loyal
Never break ties 'til we buried in the soil
If it ever go down, she trynna go too
Down for whatever bullshit I'm going through
And I gotta hold on, she's my backbone
Nothing like that feeling
When I'm in her so long
Passion and that loving that between us so strong
Grippin' on that ass, she just tell me ""hold on""
She could be the wife, maybe one day
Have a few kids go and travel out the state
She gonna ride or die for a nigga 'til the grave
And I hope it never change

Me and you for life, team us
Big face rollies, you can get the same one
I'm in that Mulsanne, you in that coupe, what?

Ride for me baby, everything is guaranteed
Anything you ever wanted, or ever need
Turn life out of any dream
I mean that, keep it 100
When I need that, she gon' come runnin'
When I fiend for it, give that ass to me

Ace Hood,"In Jesus name I wish somebody would just give him some praise
In the name of Jesus, is there anybody that could open up their mouth
And just begin to praise the Lord, my God (hallelujah)
In the name of Jesus,
Trials and the tribulations
He promised you He will never leave you nor forsaken you
But He never promised that you wouldn't have no trials or tribulations
These things are necessary
In your growth and your development in God
The trials and the tribulations, activate the oil on your life
They activate the strength that lays dormant in you
The struggle, the pressure, the loss
All these things contribute in defining who you are
The story of your life
That is that precious, precious oil
It’s the handiwork and will of God
Is there anybody that could just begin to declare that God is good
Is there anybody that could just stand up right now
Open up your mouth and tell somebody that God brought me through?
Is there anybody right now that has a testimony that will just call up right now
And tell of the goodness, tell of the mercy of the Lord?
Is He God?
Is He God all by himself?
Somebody give him a praise!
Somebody give him a shout!
Oh hallelujah, glory!",Testimony,2013
Ace Hood,"I speak on behalf of the people
Hope, faith
We all got a story, this is me

Okay, please forgive me father all the sinning I done did
All the dirt I had to do
All the trouble I've been in
Went through Trials & Tribulations every day to make some ends
I'm a walkin' testimony still I stand yet again
You don't know shit that I been through, all this pain ain't that the truth
So much tears that I done cried feeling like I ain't got shit to lose
Why my granny passed away? Why my daughter didn't stay?
Wish they both was here today oh Lord in Jesus name
I done been through hell and back momma dodgin' heart attacks
Ain't no A/C in the house just a broken thermostat
Bill collectors on my line please don't fuckin' call me back
Got me stressin' about this shit ain't no way I could relax
I was only eighteen ain't no money comin' fast
Had no choice but turn to God take some trouble of her back
Everything just goin' wrong feel like nothin' goin' right
I just seen my homie Dale and he died within the night
Boy these streets ain't nothin' nice had to make way out the hood
Don't nobody give a damn had to make sure we was good
Just like that before you knew it I had got my record deal
When you make it from the bottom just imagine how it feel
Lord knows them niggas hate everybody had a doubt
Who this nigga think he is that little black boy from the south
They was laughin' at me then ain't no laughin' at me now
And for those who don't believe ask 'em now who run the town
Ain't no way I'm givin' up, ain't no way I'm givin' in
I done lost it all before can't go through this shit again no (no)
Lord forgive me, for what I'm about to do, forgive me for my sins,
For the known, for the unknown, amen

Let me get it back to legit to quit Porsche got two percented tint
Bitch I made so many hits look how quickly they forget
Go ahead and count me out you can talk behind my back
Don't give a fuck about what you say so you think my music wack
That ain't what my banker said couple million wired in
Hope I see a hundred more that's before retirement
Motivation on you hoes ain't no waitin' on the dough
Heard they prayin' that I fail tell them Ace will never fold
I'm a walkin' testimony and I mean just what I say
Looked my daughter in her eyes right before she passed away
Watched them doctors pull the plug don't wanna live another day
This was all in God's fate could not be no other way
How I did it, I kept my faith
They tried to break me but there ain't no way
I kept my focus whipped up the potion
And when you make it out the struggle you the chosen
I seen the light, oh glory glory, trials and tribulations my life is a story
And everything I did to make it made me who I am today
We the Best is in my blood ain't no father around to thank
I'm a lion in this field and my heart is made of steel

A new Mussolini in back of the six
I'm shittin' on rappers, these rappers is sick
Cause my homies got whips that these rappers ain't get
Cause we crackin' them bricks and I package the zip
And I'm switchin' my flow, I spit crack in this bitch
And I been hit your ho, now she back on my dick
But I get to the dough and get back at your bitch

And all I want is money, leave the fame to you
I graduated out of gladiator school

Walked into Mercedes bought half the lot
You keep carrying on, you getting carried out
Cause I don’t take ass whoopins, just pass ‘em out
Is this worth getting blasted about?
No forreal, is it worth getting blasted about?

Choke on some bands if I'm not mistaken

Dear heavenly father
I come to you today
To remove all these evil spirits
Keep us out of harm’s way
Never allow us to die broke

I pray for them children
Who woke up this morning and lost they life
How dare the government
Passin’ these laws to remove the Christ
As soon as a tragedy happen
The person you call is God
Now people obeyin’ and prayin’
They prayin’ I’m sayin’ it’s odd
Fuck the world, the government too
I’m keepin’ it real
Them killers are still in political suits
And I hate it, it’s people
It’s nothin’ my brother nor sister could do
But sit back and pray
As we watchin’ the news and we take the abuse
What train of thought
Is tellin’ you shoot up a movie theatre?
What kind of fool
Gon’ walk in a school and off them angels?
It could me my moms
My brother or sister, a friend that I knew
The funny thing is
It could’ve been me, it could’ve been you
I’m tired of people
Complainin’ about the little shit
When I just lost my grandmother
To that cancer bitch
You woke up this morning, why the fuck is you mad?
You broke as a joke, get up off your ass
I hustle like niggas is broke
Even though I be countin’ the cash
I gotta get it, like I’m down to my last
Put that on my mama
Don’t wanna go through with them tears again
‘Cause when you are broke
It’s nobody there, including your friends
Lord knows, the realest shit I ever wrote
But through all the bullshit
I throw up a sign of hope
But through all the bullshit
I throw up a sign of hope

Fuck the world, the government too
I’m keepin’ it real
Them killers are still in political suits
And I hate it, it’s people
It’s nothin’ my brother nor sister could do
You can hate it or love it
But young'n I’m simply speakin’ the truth

I woke up this morning
And I got the news that my homie was shot
Out on the block and in front of his daughter
Believe it or not
Good people are sayin' and prayin’
For innocent murders to stop
We livin’ in Hell and it’s easy to tell some people are shocked
Who are you people to judge me ‘cause of the way that I live?
The way that I grind, the things that I did, the person I am
Everyone got opinions but niggas as broke as a joke
I went to them schools and spoke to the children that need it the most
I gave away toys, I gave ‘em a speech, delivered ‘em hope
It’s a blessing to become a blessing, my mama would set it in stone
Fuck these niggas hatin’ on me
Hate is such a weak emotion
And money is the root of evil
But that’s that shit that keeps me focused
Sometimes I still can’t believe I’m a father
No pain can describe
On how to reside with losin’ a daughter
Fuck this world, the ignorance too
They want me to fall
But still I continue to lace up my shoe
Society being misleaded
I’m simply giving you proof
Them people are sellin’ us lies
I’m simply speakin’ the truth
Lord knows, the realest shit I ever wrote
But through all the bullshit
I throw up a sign of hope
But through all the bullshit
I throw up a sign of hope

Fuck the world, the government too
I’m keepin’ it real

They did me dirty, I may forgive 'em, but won't forget it
And not to mention, they wasn't worthy of what I'm spittin'
It's God's will, and them haters just pray they could prevent it
I'm so addicted to gettin' it, I need intervention
The hottest spittin', your favorite rapper scared to admit it
Have mercy, let me bow my head
I count a million up, that's daily bread
Ain't no more humble in me, s*** is dead
Tell them p**** n****s I ain't never scared
Poor n****s hate to see a n**** win
Say you comin' for me? P**** n****, when?
I been cold-hearted since I lost a twin
I swear I love it when they hate, I made a hit again
I did this before my n****s, them
Use your b**** whenever like a membership
Never bothered over Twitter beef
We'll probably never meet up where the money be
Me and Kiko on the wood, yeah, the money seats
Five grand just to see him hit a three
Balenciagas on a n**** feet
Death to the competition, may they rest in peace

I know my mama prayin' for me, I hope your mama prayin' too
'Cause me and my n****s gotta eat, we'll die over these canned foods
Have mercy on a real n****, 'cause I'm sinnin' every day, Lord
Have mercy on a real n****, 'cause I'mma ride for my n****s, dog

What the f*** these n****s talkin' 'bout?
Load the choppers, bring them problems that they talkin' 'bout
Roll the reefer, no Khalifa, you gon' ride or die
No homicide, it's suicide before I testify
That's on my daughter, I'm runnin' Florida, no kinda, sorta
And I hear 'em talkin', that money callin', them out of order
Yeah, n****, f*** all that talkin', be 'bout it, then
A lot of small talk, there they go runnin' their mouth again
Bold n****, 'til they meet them gorillas
F*** a cavity, my n****s ain't got no fillings
Money is the motive, family is the reason
On my mama, ain't nobody ever came between it
And they never will, streets got me grippin' steel
These scared n****s need to go to church or either Dr. Phil
I tell 'em look me in my eyes, we are not the same
Lion-hearted n****, gunpowder in my veins huh

Have mercy on 'em
Bow your head

I know my mama prayin' for me, I hope your mama prayin' too
'Cause me and my n****s gotta eat, we'll die over these canned foods
Have mercy on a real n****, 'cause I'm sinnin' every day, Lord
Have mercy on a real n****, 'cause I'mma ride for my n****s, dog

P**** n****s still hatin' hard
B****, I just went and bought the boulevard
B****, I just went and blew another check
'Bout my money, catch a bullet tryna intercept
Jumpin' up out that whip, I let my chain swing
Blood up on my sneakers like I gang bang
Every day's a struggle tryna maintain
And free my real n****s in the chain gang
I hear them broke n****s still talkin'
Watch your words, do be very cautious
You threaten mine, you can pick a coffin
Ain't no talkin', tell 'em shock it once it go to sparkin'
Self-made Rollie and a pair of Js
Hood n**** livin' like I'm Bruce Wayne
New Ferrari kickin' like it's Liu Kang
Real n****, ain't it true? 2 Chainz

I know my mama prayin' for me, I hope your mama prayin' too
'Cause me and my n****s gotta eat, we'll die over these canned foods
Have mercy on a real n****, 'cause I'm sinnin' every day, Lord
Have mercy on a real n****, 'cause I'mma ride for my n****s, dog
I'mma ride for my n****s, you better ride for your n****s

Once again I see a piece of the sky 
And my joy'll never be denied 

'Cause I was meant to be here, 
The only place on earth 
Where you are near, where you are near 
Was a flower, so frail, 

And I let the trees grow wild around me. 
Grew so high, hid the sky, 
Shaded everything I needed to see 
Then one night, someone came 

Took a knife an ripped me up by my roots 
Tossed astray, far away. 
In my darkest night I started to pray 
I am standing

Why do you, why do you ask 
Why I'm not blaming my god? 
I'll tell you, I'll tell you what, 
He was the only one there 

I am standing",Ravine,1995

So many years ago, life in itself can't hurt

Can't change the fact that I'm a slave to your power

Off into foreign lands,
Where ancient ships could take me,
And then the waves come down over me.
Down over me, down over me.

Deep in a heavy fog,
Out from under a log, I creep just like an insect.
Down in the mud I stay,
Lying there five whole days,
Where no one will come find me.
And crawling down to the shore,
I can be so much more than bugs under the soil.
And then the waves come down over me.

Don't change the locks on the back door

I know em when I see em cause they got that look in their eyes
Surprise
Aceyalone has arrived
They surround around the microphone like shit attracts flies
I arise
The Thai gets me high
I find him, stand right behind him and I spy
No more than two tries; either freaks it or you die
I waited; somebody stated ""He's intimidated""
I was faded; I played it like any other brother would've played it
Nut soon as I grabbed the microphone I went into a frenzy
Started givin niggaz black eyes like Spuds Mackenzie
when that bud's in me
Now one of these niggaz tried to tell me my shit was hopeless
His homeboy was on the other side sayin ""Man your shit's the dopest""
All of a sudden another rapper pushed his way through the crowd
Came and stood in front of me and told me he was proud
Then he bowed, told me that he liked the way I styled
I thanked him, I smiled
then I had to be out

Anywhere you go
I am going to find you
And every time you flow
I'll be right behind you
Just to let you know and
constantly remind you
You can never be as dope as I am
God-damn

Now I'ma give shout out to all the dope MC's in the world...
y'all know who you are

You know I got the kinda style that everybody yearns
I mic check; I break a niggaz nectar like Kerns
Cause you are a worm, you are a germ
and you are about to be stepped on
so you should be concerned
iIf you have a perm then it's permanent
It's affirmative you will burn
Make a right turn turn
then a left turn
then a you-turn turn
Come all the way back, return
Stand stern and maybe you just might learn
about the firm
I used to be a sperm -- shoot
got derm
Nobody better not squirm
til my meeting is adjourned
Okay I'm through
And I rock from here to Peru
Vern
I could've sworn you knew
that AC's having a rap sale
you want to buy 1 or 2?
or 3 or 4 or 5
or 6 or 7 or 8
or 9 or 10 or 11
or 12 or 13 or 14?
Cause me and the mic are courting
My circuit breaker's shorting
My memory is aborting
I can barely remember this flow
but wack MC's ya still got another zillion miles or so to go

Anywhere you go
I am going to find you
And every time you flow
I'll be right behind you
Just to let you know and
constantly remind you
You can never be as dope as I am
God-damn

They pushed that rapper in front of the train
Took him to the doctor sewed his arm on again
Stabbed that rapper right in his heart
Gave him a transplant for a brand new start
and then he stopped; he started again 
he forted bounced it and vomited
Now you know who's the dominant dog
that got to be given you that rhyme style
man child, locked in the promised land
I'ma stand in the middle of an open hand 
that's extensive
Cause I don't flow religously or relentlessly
for innocent-minded-ticity
Okay I win and the battle's like over
Got a satellite Rover
with a rocket telescopic sprocket pocket pulley
and a fully automatic stun gun cause I'm a bully
My hair was wooly I'm a muillion
a calmer Jeffrey Dahmer hater
I'm greater than the latest greatest innovators
can go to hell, cause I say this so well
You can whistle my melody or noel
You're still gonna get the Speak n Spell
I get my ink from inkwell
my paper from the trees
I swell up when I eat MCs
so eat these
and stand at attention
did I forget to mention
my classes aren't expensive
That's if you are an uncomprehensive
Defensive sensitive 
toy rapper
Little boy rapper
Momma's wittle wappin man wapper
Now you got me reachin for my zapper
I'll cut you off with a clapper
But that's for old gentlemen
who drink coffee with cinnamon, it'll take ten of them
Then again did I mention I'm potent
Totin holdin reloadin votin 
with my channel changer fool
and since I don't speak Greek stranger
I'ma give it to you in layman's terms so you'll learn...

Anywhere you go
I am going to find you
And every time you flow
I'll be right behind you
Just to let you know and
constantly remind you
You can never be as dope as I am

ok i'll make this short 
we in the house
we got Mikah 9 Abstract Rude Peace
Vic Hop Fat Jack and myself Aceyalone

we come for the glory of the be	-boy kingdom
bring them laughter after which bring them tears

i seen it comin' and knew it was a plot
legislation had a plan to kill hip hop
i got wind from a snitch i kept in contact w/this
bitch ass judge who was paid off
soon after that he got laid off
i'm lettin' niggas know you tryin' to stop a muthafucka's flow
hold your black stallions and your black sheeps
black clan aided a nigga and got heat
we met up on Stepney and Market sparked it 
mapped out the target
we gon' take out their number one sergeant
young and strong we bailed up on their front lawn
to kill the enemy
remember me
well if you remember me you'll remember
i'm the one who broke into the pentagon took fouls planted bombs
now i possess the blueprint
i counter the message you sent
no longer will you slander and tamper w/our music
copies of the document we're xeroxed 
the ghetto took offense in defense of hip hop
shot down rolled 'em up loc'ed up bailed out
saved the day 
then into thin air i fade away
scorpion

we come for the glory of the be	-boy kingdom
bring them laughter after which bring them tears

the story had never been told until now
as the glory of the kingdom come comes down
disguised as a janitor the washman
i swept and mopped the floors
better yet i was a spook behind the door
w/a perfect view from the bannister
feeling like Lee Harvey
'cept i got a hundred million years in me
first thing i did was aim
lock him in my scope
squeeze
bust his melon open now i'm pleased 
in the name of MC's
already passed the time that they allotted me
the housekeeper spotted me
it was either her or me
click clack
she says i will not say what i see
but i never could have trusted her so i busted her in her chest
then laughed
then headed for the elevator shaft
but it was too late the jig was up
there was pigs all in the building
so i tried to escape to the fire escape from homicide
yeah i killed him
hangin' from the third story ladder 
i dropped and i felt my ankle shatter
no time to lose juice from my bladder
my mission was completed and that was all that mattered
the van was parked a hundred yards from the scene of the crime
but it was hard to run w/a broken foot
just like i thought they blasted
i took one to the gut
i was laying there thinkin' about death
just watchin' my blood spill out
just then the van pulls up and i jump in
and then we pull out (?lickin'?) shouts for the glory

we come for the glory of the be	-boy kingdom
bring them laughter after which bring them tears

i walk in like a normal black
gun peckin' jaw snatching 
slide
they like the way i glide
to the back break out my backpack and stack my shit up
ah it's bulging now
looked around heard a gun shot
pow
i looked down I whipped out my shit
unloaded my clip
jetting by the count i slipped 
tripped out
landed on my hip crawled out
i hit a tuck and roll up and out
into a flip and boned out now i'm zonin'
I'm nine glocks and seven 380's richer
i'm fit to blow the foundation off this beyotch up
synchronized for the race 
i push the button
nuke the place
timed myself dashin to the ride
i hops inside 
keys already in the ignition
i cranks it slaps it in drive

and everybody in your business
damn
now what is really your main aim
when you are just a blotch and a stain on the planetary plane
just another name in the phone book of fame
bustin' out the seams it seems you haven't gained enough
to be seen in the right scene
your thoughts they seem so convincing hmmm
but your actions don't follow through
remember
never say never because it never comes true
your thoughts they seem so convincing for instance
you told me that you're a level higher
liar
element of desire earth and the wind and the fire
not
you ain't even halfway hot
not lukewarm you don't got no form
you (...?...)
all caught up in bein' waterproof
when you shoulda been tryin' to catch up w/the truth
for all intent and purposes your life on earth ain't worth it's weight in

that's probably why you get blowed
cause people tell people things and people sell people things
that are useless and irrelevant
and it stifles my intelligence

you know we keep it true   - we keep it true we keep it true

you can mumble jumble if you got somethin' to say
but i doubt it's gonna affect me i row my boat steady
everready is my battery description
meaning i'm equipped to take long trips
and my brain cells overload when i get blowed
gotta bring it down there's a point where the joint stops
being passed through the fingers of a rhyme (?singers?)
the smoke from my last hit still lingers
bring us your tired and your weary and your poor
i'm a take you higher while you're hearing metaphors
and similes
assimilation of new creation
mind emancipation
rhymes command the nation
and so on and therefor and such and such
dust to dust i thrust from the ground
w/no where else to go but up L.A. is where i'm found
throwin' up sets and blowin' up sets and goin' up Stepney 
about to get a heavy track

we got to keep it true       - relax your mind w/the music

now i'm gonna take my last verse on a good note
you better prepare your footnotes
hold your wigs tight
open up the middle
(?center me in the more?)
words are the foundation action is the building and unity
and the concept to result in logic and the use of logic
now the object to be neutral partial to a judgement
and the subject's concentration here is the pop quiz

left in a whirlwind put a brother in a tailspin

had a few laughs and kicks
but me and my clique don't be trippin' no tricks
i still got a piece of me to give you
you still got a piece of you to give me
you listenin' but you don't hear me
we can pick up right where we left at but
i gotta be me and you gotta accept that
i just want to be homies
cause i ain't got love like Monie
cause soon as you got close you got ghost
and you tried to leave Acey 'lone-why
so hook up w/me if you can cool
but you know i know what you get loose to
and if you play your cards right get your shit tight
then we might be down like we used to

if it wasn't for a mic check you wouldn't have a check at all
 - a one two, and I'm a check you

I start most of my raps off kinda slow
just so you could see exactly where it gonna go
I make sure your body's strapped in
cause I'ma tailspin and you're liable to get thrown
The bible is the microphone; I read from the scripture
leave it up to you to see the pictures
I hover above MC's like a flying saucer
with the sorcery to alter the future 
present and the past, don't be hesitant to ask
me to be the man I'll be the last
I'll be movin fast on that ass, I stipulate your fate 
I take a grip I'll take a shot I'll break your plates
Now can you take the weight or do I have to make it lighter tighter
than you could imagine that I had to been when I recite a rhyme
I might as well be inside of your mind
I know you thinkin, ""Damn!  How does he?  What was he a man
or a machine with computerized diagrams?""
I tell em, ""Nope! I am of the flesh, fresh, dope""
I'm set apart you're just a shot in the dark
and the darkness casts no shadow
And I'll be victorious, no matter who I battle
So every rapper in the house shut the fuck up!

Cause if it wasn't for a mic check you wouldn't have a check at all
 - check one, check two
If it wasn't for a mic check I wouldn't have a check at all
 - check a one two check a one two
If it wasn't for a mic check you wouldn't have a check at all
 - a check one check two now I check you

Now everyone knows I got the Milk like D, homemade quilt
to get your wig peelt, like it should be
Top o' the mornin to ya, it's so many ways to do ya
I offer you the shield, just before I deal on ya
I recommend, that when I squeeze the puss from your skin
you pretend it ain't happenin
Cause everywhere is my stompin grounds
When MC's stepped in I stomp em down to the lowest
You the slowest rapper that I met, but you owe us all a favor
not to, jet (nah you ain't goin nowhere)
not until you show us you be flippin
I give your body lashes and whippins
T crashes the board like Pippen, I has to be trippin
Not for your pleasure or your entertainment I came with
a crew called self, and everybody looked just like me
And we agreed that we dope fool
We got flavor and everyone knows who's the saviour
Cause everyone knows, everyone knows
Everyone knows I got flow

And if it wasn't for a mic check I wouldn't have a check at all

If it wasn't for a mic check I wouldn't have a check at all
 - a one two, a check a one two
If it wasn't for a mic check you wouldn't have a check at all

See the mic check brings all the chaos to order
I conquer the perimeter sealing the borders
to catch the feeble child weeble wobble style evil subject
Too deadly ready to wreck, anyone in my way
I am what is know as the expandable specimen
not understandable when I handle my mic check
I enlarge to full capcacity drasticallly fast
it has to be my well manicured dastardly pure blast
will sniffle and lift, level and shift, earthplates 
Speeded up birthrate repetitive let it live then let it die
Right inside the eye of the negative
I love puttin pressure on the lesser competitive
Inferior you're determined, vermin, sherman stick smoked
I got the elephantitus styles superior stroke
of genius, I spoke and hell broke loose
I saturated the streets, 'fatuated by drum beats
My heat, so-lar, warms the po-lar
Melting glaciers, I are shooting star chaser
The laser beam on my hip swings when I rip
Fully loaded electricity clips I can't miss
stimulating your body fluids to flow as well as I do
I do what is necessary to counter the blockage
I can just rocket/rock-it with no fuel, dual exhaust
is costing your life renewal
I bring about a change meanin I'm about as strange as they come
I come from the depths and wish they slept none son
I am I was I be because I'm me
originality for your fatality
Now I am a traveler word scambler
not a scribbler or a scavenger, eatin the place
You're greedy and feedin your face, cause you're needin a taste

Well I scrapes the neighbourhoods lookin' for odd jobs
It's hard livin' like God in a world full of bobs
John doe's and jacks joe's and mary mack's
I guess babylon wasn't made for blacks now was it
Well it doesn't really matter does it
Cause it be dependin' on the who what why's and the whereabouts
And I'm a nigga that the world don't care about
Mr outsider
It's all about bein' a fighter
Use the guide to open up your mind a little wider
My mellow my ace
Movin' from place to place all a nigga want is a taste
Working on the docks wearin' a smock
I clock in I clock out about 5 o'clock
I keeps a calm disposition
So I won't arouse suspicion
But then I know what you're wishin'
That you could put a bullet in my head plate w/out all that red tape
And lead me straight to the grave
You're either a slave or Jesus got you saved
Or you don't know how to behave but you're brave
A mixed up African w/a fingerwave
And the load ain't gettin' no lighter
Even though I'm in it to win it I'm still a outsider

Well back in the days they told me hip hop pays
So I says I strays aways from L.A.'s average
Cause C.k-in' and B.k-in'* was bein' a savage (* refering to Crips and Bloods
Maybe?)
And M.C.-in' and DJ-in' was bringin' the cabbage
Now it ain't like a nigga talking hella late in the game
I'm talkin '80 ace deuce
Nobody think about truce
No Menace no Boys In The Hood no Juice
It was more like Coolie[sp] High and
niggas truly die like they do
When I found out you got to choose your path I knew
Not red and blue
The blackness is true
My tactics was new
That's when the practice grew and I flew
I wanted to be a rapper so simple and plain
From Los Angeles city of the big bang theory
Where everyone is leery
Now a whole mess of MC's fear me
But it's important everybody hear me
As I tell you about the unwanted man who got blunted and took what he can
And he ran
From city to city and town to town
Bouncin' around like he's about to blow the world up
Cause his mind's not dormant anymore his door's ajar
And his jar's full of somethin' else
Now everyone knows that scarecrows w/velcro hair ain't real
Yeah
But if your psyche is likely to be spilled
Ain't no tellin'
You'll be sailin' across the seas like Magellan
Way out your range and since I don't speak greek stranger
I'm a (?let me?) give it to you in layman's terms so you'll learn
I paid the piper I'm gon' pick the tune
But I don't listen to music like that
So

You're gettin' outside yourself boy you're gettin outside yourself - is that
Right
You're gettin' outside yourself boy you're gettin' outside yourself - uh huh
You're gettin' outside yourself boy you're gettin' outside yourself - uh 1 2

You better run and hide yourself boy cause you can't provide for self

Inside outside
That's what doin' it is all about right
Inside outside inside outside
That's what doin' it is all about

Now I'm a outsider but not like ponyboy
I'm Aceyaloney boy
And I transcend
?w/both hands in?
And I transfer the answer from w/in
And I strain and I gain the strength to bust a blood vessel
As my dirty thoughts mudwrestle in my head muscle
You got your lucky charm I know you believe in warlocks
You better be keepin' you door locked and bolted
Say praise the lord as I raise the sword and revolted
Psychological warfare for the holy
Smoke your last bowl-y
Your little ship a capsizes your rap dies slowly
Got a good old fashion passion for smashin' what they built
W/no guilt
At full tilt
At full speed
At full blast
Comin' full circle on that ass
I'm the idealistic realistic mystic from the past
That just gets more intelligent
Don't risk it I'm fast
Better get involved don't know how the world revolves and evolves
And solve all that you can solve before your mind dissolves
Now who kilt (killed) this lion? curiosity
Now why's the black man dyin'? it's an atrocity
Does history really repeat itself or is it phophecy?
So until I leave my physical shell there ain't no stoppin' me

this rhythm is sick this rhythm's ridiculous

well up until now your only concept of rhythm is a four by four loop
square as a pool table 
with no dynamics implanted but you couldn't understand
why all of your gigantic rap sounded so bland
but the answer was right in your hand
couldn't believe you were so naive to 
arrangements changes different time signatures
the freedom of your imagination that must have been a fixation with blocks
like tryin to make a wheel out of rock
like tryin to make a puppet out of sock
see i got that private stock the personal vat with the broth and gravy
and the electrons to pass on so the world don't seem so wavy
oh everybody hollerin save me save yourself before it's too late into the
when you go because my wig got weight i gotta concentrate on

you really want to know who the Ace is
Ace is the face that's seldom sighted

two heads i'm a head ahead one of the better bred
know you're thinkin I'm gonna be I got the remedy to turn you out
i got the fiery styles that'll burn you out if you don't learn that route
now i been there done that did it committed to run that
talk to it do it right

hip hop is more than yes y'all
throw your hands in the air say ho
and give up the W cause i'm from the west y'all
and you know i got mad fat flow
coming in the house through the back door out the front door
cross the frontyard into the street

now the problem with you MC's today is you're too emotional
you have no devotion to the social bug spread 
by the words you said to the public
you have no regard for the masses how you effect them 
and how they view you
now you know you knew you were open wide for the 
whole wide world to do you
now i propose those who chose their flows
irresponsible and irrationally
be exhausted from the face of the earth and be forced to deal w/me
me i'd rather be undefined not underestimated or undermined
i'm underlined as the underdog under the influence of time
now i know you're sick of that same old same old 
lame old running man dance style
niggas screamin' and yellin' and tellin' lies about what they do
brother I say to you but don't you believe or be deceived 
by the hip hop that you breath
i am multidirectional i move randomly and professional
intellectual with perpetual

that leaves me with a twisted view of the whole wide world as i know it
and i guess i got no choice but to be a poet

Verse One:

now in my natural habitat i gravitate towards having that
and i elevate on having that
and i'll never get caught in your rabbit trap
from Yellowstone to Venezuela
Nigeria down through Australia
there's somethin i learned that i gotta tell ya
there's a whole lot of us ain't wrapped too tight

now i could been your doctor or your lawyer
or come to your house and clean up for ya
self destruction won't destroy ya
if you got somebody that's lookin out for ya
men are murdered women raped
people gettin beat on videotape
and people elsewhere tryin to escape
just to come to America to lick the plate

hell is here so i hope you 'stand

now everyday i manifest and i generate and smoke cannabis
and i penetrate and i innovate and i demonstrate from Los Angeles
from Amsterdam to the Northern border

somethin' i learned that i haven't told ya
brothers like me don't live too long

now i know you know it ain't who you know but do you know you
see cause you could go just like any Joe and that's for sho' true
so if you're straight and you're narrow and the snake's in the barrel
and the serpent is under the rainbow
and you're head over heels instead of the reals
then you're bound to be tangled
cause brothers are singin' and dancin' and rappin' 
like they was a vaudeville act
but knowledge is wealth and you gotta know self
and you gotta know God's still black
cause every so often i sit and i wonder why i even trip at all
cause half are down when i get down
the other half want to see me fall
waitin around all heaven bound and you seen that your L-7's round
and when the sky falls to the ground 
and you found that the only way up is down
don't give me no additives no sedatives or preservatives
or repetitive rhetoric you give
just let it live
yet my head is poundin' i'm dealin' with this load on my mind

i got a head full of headaches a heart that's full of woes man
i'm constantly singin' them downhome blues and not many peoples knows man
that leaves me with a twisted view of the whole wide world as i know it

that's why people got to get their high so they can get high
they blast and they passed the pipe to get high

didn't do it but i just rather get a little shut eye
so i sleep from dawn to dusk in a bomb shelter

when the man is gonna drop that big one

Won't you play if for me. In the mix mister hop

Verse 1:
The second somebody dies somebody else is born
People are celebrating while other people mourn
Home may be home to you but to me it's foreign
Even the matador don't pull the bull by the horns
One man's enemy is another man's friend
One man's poisons is another man's medicine
So let us stand, let us sit and let us view 
The changing of the guard oh it's so hard to keep it true
It's the balance of the scales it can't be challenged or expelled
Soon as somebody lost somebody else prevails
Some someone is quiet at the same time someone yells
Half full or half empty water in the well
It's the Half and Half Hypothesis the 50/50 theory
Eerie as it may seem check your balance beam
It's the Half and Half Hypothesis the 50/50 theory
Eerie as it may seem check your balance beam
Now check your Balance Beamer with a feather and a rock
Wheath or not you find the answer is really not the plot 
See it's like Love and Hate (love...and hate)
The same emotion different weight
People Love to Hate so I know you know just how this all relates
It's the posa and the nega tive
Mini and mega live 
Arm a leg a leg an arm headed by a nigga
Like big and small 
Short and tall
Night and day and so on
Some people are bashfull 
Some people just love to get their flow on (they flow on)
So here goes one to grow on
I'm a go on and on and on till the principles are laid out
The scales of justice weighed out
Till your memory starts to fade out and your game of life is played out
Got to balance out the power don't we?
Balance your emotions
Push and pull positions like the moon pulls on the ocean
Balance on one foot that's equilibrium 
Opposites attract and retract that's a fact
I'm a Libra y'all!
180 degrees but not that hot
So whether or not you find the answer is really not the plot (really not the
plot)
Because giving is receiving (and) and seeing is believing (and)
And the solar system rotes so harmonious and even
It's perfectly balanced

Verse 2:
Some people say life is about taking chances choices and decisions
Voices and opinions, politics and religion
Clues the past and cash and keys to the future
It's a possibility and probability on who's gonna execute yo ass
Some slow and analytical
Some quick fast on the dash
Like heads or tails but the head usually leads the tail
So I tell my tales from the head
Cause they're embedded inside my cells
Real quick let me tell you about a fact I know things will even out
You can disbelieve or doubt or even shout or leave it in your mouth
Cause how you gone reason wit grand Mother Nature 
Running mother Earth controlled by Father Time who's the chaser
It's living and dying homey
Laughing and crying dude
Trying or lying my brother 
Walking or flying fool
Now half of you are gone find the time to shine
The other half gone find crime, money weed wine 
Till it's to late in a disillusion state of mind
I just found my peace of mind
Now they want a piece of mine
To late in a disillusion of mind
The orthodox is the unorthodox they just got you on the names
The insane and the sane are the same
It's a damn shame so many people's aim is so lame
And their gain is so minimal
Caught up in the subliminal
It's pleasure and pain, water for the flames, the wild and the tame
The style still remains if you use the right side of your brain
Instead of going against the grain
You can penetrate the vein to the point where what remains is a stain

If you knew what makes me tick
It'll probably make you sick
Lay my days of my life in front of you 
and I'll let you take your pick
Come on
Pull back the curtain but make sure that you are certain
That it will be worth the energy that you end up exerting
Now walk past the doorway step in the foyer
Don't you bother knocking
I'm a grandfather clockin' everything you do
I'm seeing through you faultiness
So sprinkle me but not with saltiness
The ghetto taught me this
I fought for this, I fight for this, I spend my life for this
And if you put your brain to work it ain't hard to decipher this
Counting down the days boy closer to your doom
Time keeper for the Reaper, the family heirloom
Like staring at my grandfather clock inside my room
It'll never miss a tick-tock, it strikes everyday a noon
Every hour on the hour, it'll sing a tune
Every half hour ot'll croon and yell out at the moon
You can't escape the master time, no one is immune
The hands of time will grab you when the moments opportune

No one is immune
When the moments opportune

Carved from a tree trunk bark
What a wonderful work of art
Well I usually wear my sundial
but it don't work when it's dark 
(don't work when it's dark)
No electric parts spark as mechanical as he is
He'll kindly say just wind me and then show me where the key is
Then I go about my day and I flow about the way
He never has nothing to say, he just sits there on display
I seen one in the cafe, one inside the cabaret
Timekeeper for the Reaper, what a pretty price to pay

So don't you bother knockin' at, I'm a Grandfather clokin'

The pendulum is swinging and it just don't ever stop
Tick-tock

I used to have this coo-coo clock 
that would bother my Grandfather clock
Never gave it no rest so I flew over the top of the nest
And then at my request I ask him to resign
He was never on time, one hour behind
At ten, he stuck at nine
But he did not fuck with mine cause I murdered that machine
If you ever beat the clock you know exactly what I mean 
(exactly what I mean)
I hold my Grandfather clock in high esteem
My alarm clock screams cause he knows how long it takes me
But my Grandfather clock leans over and he shakes me
And they both race against time to see who will be 
the first to wake me
But when I became awoke my alarm clock was broke
And my Grandfather clock was staring right down my throat
And he leaned a little bit closer and he told and I quote:
""If you ever race against me,  you will surely come up short,"" 
He said, ""I'm better than your Timex, your Rolex or your Swatch
Your Fossil, Casio, Quartz, your diamond studded watch,""
He said, ""I control how long you stay alive
I'ma tap you on you shoulder at eleven fifty-five""
When the time arrives and then and only then
you'll have your five minutes of funk
I said my final salutations as I stepped amongst the monks
Then he took me exactly where I stodd like he should
And I tried to reason with him and I tried knocking on wood

Asalaam alaikum, people of good will
I offer you the greeting of thought manifested skill
to finally reveal the open-end chapter
As real as the flesh that you're embodied in
to the skull cavity your mind is rotting in, I'll be riding in
And there might have been a slight, rotation warp to curve
the course of course I'm cordial when I'm reportin
I won't distort, I don't contort
connect conduct collect console or conceal
In full control of the roll of the wheel
My eyes are my appliance to decipher the science
Omitting defiance with the high-tech mic check
The buttons that flashed I pushed for absolute
destruction your structure is lifted from the ground
The foundation mound is broke, so you float around
I'm embedded in what is known as beat
Let it be shown, every enzyme is complete
In time, you'll see the pace of the pulse pump
rapidly, heart rate, happily marched
I happen to be the dark man who holds the charts
I arch my horizontal line to make a rainbow
.. but it ain't the same though, yo
The tried and true pros are chasing fool's gold
sliding through holes, like small rodents
It's obviously, evident my embellishment
peaks at two-ninety-two I.Q.
Cause Big Ace is the spinner, in the, center
Inventor, and I plan to be a winner meaning
I'll be in the inner outer ovaries, overload, overboard
overseas hearin oversees more, than the eye can
I stand, limited primitive, sentimentalist, escapist
The way I shape this landscape, automatically makes this, vivid
I give it a rivet, hold it, stand at the pivot
I love it, learn to live it, then give you my exhibit
Not inhibited, not even a little bit, when I'm inclined
My attempts to redefine your hip-hop guidelines
and you can play the sidelines, write rhymes in your spare time
My attempts to redefine your hip-hop guideline
You can play the sideline, write rhymes in your spare time
cause I'd rather stimulate your mind than emulate your purpose
And we have only touched on the surface of the serpent
Consider me part of the dust, in the dusk
I must collect the samples from the rust
Penetrate the crust then trust no living
Driven by the sonic, language passion
Your ashes spark the flashes, of the neon
from be-yond, what kind of planet could I be on?
I don't know, but I'ma be on, for eons, and eons
While many think that they can never play out
Get trapped in a timeframe, and never find their way out
I stay off the dramatization, and I balance
Always seeking the challenge, to show the world
the incredible talents, I cut the corners, smooth out the surfaces
Worthlessness is just, half of the problem
I read the grid kid, I did every column
I note the animal kingdom, and the phylum
WHYLUM style em, until they get to hit the target
I mark it on the bullseye, of flies
and the buffalo wing in the sky
My architectnique sparks the dark streets of your resting ground
I suggest that you warn your town
I inhabit the oxygen, mark off the memory
You will never forget to remember the lone wolverine
marine biologist machine with the verbal
Internal mind fertile, foot, over hurdle
Tight, like girdle, and my word'll be the last
I incubate, every other millennium
I fast and I hibernate, to pass any of em
I am potent, untraceable
No color no odor no taste no replaceable parts
No heart, no head, just a carcass
The darkest days come, right before the light
I watch my watch and stand right before the mic
By the powers, vested in me, I digested MC's
food for thought, caught on to the end of the rope and swung
Then stood stiff,  as if, I was on a cliff
Not beneath sticks, my feet are made of bricks
When I walk my footprints indent cement
I am not practical, nor am I unusual
Nor am I oblivious to, hideous crimes
Every city is captured and trapped in my mind
Given the spinal tap, as the final rap climbs
My attempts to redefine your hip-hop guidelines
You can play the sidelines, write rhymes in your spare time
My attempts to redefine your hip-hop guidelines
You can play the sidelines, write rhymes in your spare time
Cause I have become the night owl on the prowl
Master of the free penpal style
Cause I'm, om-nipotent
I'm, some, government experiment that is out of control
I'm from some big black hole
I square up, select, and rec'd, every tangle
I flare up, and you can try, any angle
Even Bermuda, but I bury the barracuda

Come here
Let me holler at you face to face
See ace been place to place
I seen a million of em
They look at me for a split second
Then they grin, never to be seen again
But it`s locked in, so I can read every line
Its written all over your upside down mind
With an upside down smile
Whoops upside your head, well hey now
I never forget a face, especially your`s
Because the mirror is the only dimension without flaws
I look out till again
And then begin to look out for the faces of men
Cause I done been face to face with a serpent
Demon is the same think it is when it ain't
White like snow or black like coal
Yellow like the moon and red(read) like a book
To live or die is the plot but the face is the hook
So meet the face from left field
3 eyes two ears one nose and a grill, but still remain faceless
Oh ya

Let me holler at you face to face
See ace been place to place
I seen plenty of em
But don`t let the face fool ya
There`s so many of em, but still remain faceless
Let me holler at you face to face
See ace been place to place
I seen plenty of em
But don`t let the face fool ya
There`s so many of em, but still remain faceless

So can I take a poloroid? -say cheese-
Of the face that got you employed -please-
Same face your momma enjoyed as a boy
Will be the same face that will get you destroyed
Now you got to face the facts, face the music
You cannot about face it and turn back when you abuse it
So wisdoms use it wise, bat thoses eyes, show them teeth
Lick them lips even powder them cheeks
So while your passin`, I'm askin` myself
I wonder if she knows what I`m looking at
Well look at that, a face that got me looking back
I can see the history in your bone structer
I can see the misery in your frown
So smile now and cry later
Or just walk around with the face of a clown and still remain faceless
I said smile now and cry later
Or just walk around with the face of a clown and still remain faceless

Let me holler at you face to face
See ace been place to place
I seen plenty of em
But don`t let the face fool ya
There`s so many of em, but still remain faceless
Let me holler at you face to face
See ace been place to place
I seen plenty of em
But don`t let the face fool ya
There`s so many of em, but still remain faceless

Do you know how far a face can take you?
It can make you or break you, or inflate you
They`re either going to love you or hate you
Or never notice you if you`re a face they don`t relate to
You fear my face, don`t want to get near my face
You get judged by your mug, they didn`t hear your case
Now face the wall -face the wall!-
Your face is against the law
You look at me I look at y`all
I recelect everything I saw in the face of the prowl
But I'm just another face in the crowd -just another face in the crowd-
To figure that at face value is not allowed
Tell it to my face, and tell it to me now
Tryin` to mad dog, but you got the face of a puppy dog
Like a puppet, just like a baby doll
Ain`t that right baby face? cutie pie?
Good lookin`? twinkle in your daddies eye?
And then scarface replied I was born with a face I can`t hide
-a face I can`t hide- a face full of pride
A face that`s been denide on sight
I reconize the face but the name slips by
But still your not faceless

But I got a hit with the ultimate twist
Looka here, listen up clear
Niggas been bitin my shit for years
Mousekateer turned muskateer want to bust in here
I don't think so, the golden mic belongs to me
The flow sounds dope but the song is free
Damn, these fools sound wrong to me
What's the definition of a strong MC?
Let's take MC such-and-such
want to freestyle but he doin too much
Here's another blunt, take another puff
Keep on smokin till you high enough

 Hang up on the motherfucker, fuck that fool""

Nigga actin like he wrote the book
By the tone of his voice he soundin shook
Then he put the phone back on the hook

A lotta fools choke when it's on they turn
I know that I shouldn't even be concerned
But I gotta lotta MC's to burn
Could be you or the one you with

Yo, come on, homie, now stop it
Why should I put the mic in yo hands if you can't even rock it?
You gotta dig in deep, no time to sleep
When they play the beat, gotta bring in the heat
Tell em what they know, what they don't know
What they want to hear, what they fear, what they want, need
You can be down, just don't deceive
Got a whole lotta tricks up my sleeve
Might say somethin that you don't believe
But the show ain't over until I leave
I don't need no intro, no outro, in essential
Just my utensils and my instrumental

All over your mascarade

First thing you should know is that I'm not afraid
Every rapper has the potential to be laid down on his or her back
When I'm down on my luck I get down on the track
I clown on the rap sorta like Barnum and Bailey
My star dust bust is bigger and brighter than Haley's Comet
I'll vomit up the astronomical the daily
Peel to steal skin off the mic and do it scaly, the think rapper

And strangle him with the microphone
And drag him back to Project Blow (echo)
I hold as many mics as I could possibly hold
And rip up the session after the last rapper flowed
I never fold even though my poker face is old
The world's cold, probably why I stay in battle mode
I would love to touch ya' ego
European, Latin, or Negro
Rap Evil Kinevil, but I ain't evil
It's all nice, especially with the mic device
When it's in my head, it's like throwin' the trick dice
It's the worldwide underground heist
What I'ma give back, is more than suffice
Pour me over ice and drink, to think
Your only as strong as ya' weakest
I dwell amongst the deepest
As long as there's speakers
I play songs for the peoples
I push the ink, who gives a fuck what they think
It's tight now, but wait until I iron out the kinks (repeat)

Wait until I iron it all out, it'll be cool
Like I said I want everyone to be able to do their thing successfully

Reflections
Think about the present and the past times
Reflect on your life and the bad times
Think about the crazy and the strange shit
Then dig within inside and try to change shit
Reflections
Reflect your mind
Reflect through time

(PSC):
My relation to these words spoken over beats leaps to and fro
All around, bound the energy in miles
Piles up towards the sky
High quantity of thoughts
Reflect the truth, sold another brother on the watch
On the clock of life, the mirror view
The clearest of reflection
Inspection of the lie that lies deep behind the stressin'
And it's pressing me like time
Rhymes is just illusions
A world in confusion
A dream of revolution
These reflections like mine in the puddle of life
Skip rocks, waves making ripple effects
Situations etched, lessons in stone tablets
For the reference to the habit
Forming addictions to the memories of past shit
I let go, it comes back
Boomerang behavior runs common in the obstacles
I want to shake my coat tails
They follow on the missions of my failure
Bring me down, crush me
Reflections can be beautiful, but most the time they rush me

(Aceyalone):
And in an instance you see the mirror image looking at you
Looks just like you, got you eyes, and you whole disguise
Reflections, he seen his image in the lake
Reflected on the grass roots which harbors all the snakes
Otherwise known as a snake pit
Remember the python on you ankle and all that fake shit?
Remember when the cake was lit, and the wind blew it out?
Before you could taste the cream, they sliced it up and threw it out
I recollect, I think back in retrospect
I reflect and connect my memories
Remember these good times and these hard times
But it's like that, and that's the way it is
And that's the way it was, but that ain't how it gotta be
Reflect your mind, it works every time
'cause if I knew then what I knew now, I'd be doin' fine
Reflect your mind, it works every time
'cause if you knew then what you know now, you'd be doin' fine

(BFAP):
Reflect though time....
I peep when I meet people, evil or positive
We live in the middle, lost within the riddle
On God's reflection I stand, within an intersection of life lost
Double crossed by man, we stand ignorant
False prophet, gothic, prehistoric logic mixed our minds
Reflectin' signs of anger, reflection banger, reflection slanger
Reflection bombing hangars of 747's
Strangers want to blow this shit to heaven
Reflection war, reflectin' poor, reflectin' Cold War
Reflectin' old multiple metal jacket tactics
You might see Murs reflectin' curse
Reflectin' hurts, you's a bitch in a male skirt
If you don't work to change your world, reflectin' hurls
In life with wisdom, beyond ""blaow! blaow!""
Fake headwrapped female visions
We used to be in love with Duran Duran in '95
I got a condo in the white part of town
Change your name to Shanunu Brown, used to be Mary Tibbles

The only thing constant is change
With that, it's the shape of things to come, yeah

Yo, I'm the open-est emotions, I'm a river in straight
A crystal clean lake, yo, the essence of skin
The form of a luminescent bright light fluorescent
(You got light?)
Don't wait till it's dark to ask questions
I been sparkin' in sections and blessing mics with my presence
Since many were pre-pubescent puberty adolescent
Perhaps you need a lesson in, addressin' with respect an'
Too many feel inadequate without their little weapon

It's like I got the whole world against me, need to get intensely
A head full of headache he's and a hand full of sissies
Them so flimsy so why there one MC
There wasn't one before hasn't been one since me
A gangster of love, I come from up above
I give the mic a tug, I give the world a hug
I give the skies a kiss, I give suckers a kiss
Some people like my old styles better than this but

Yo, I'm Spacey like Kevin and some do knowledge of seven
Praise Jesus and Jah, Buddha, Allah or just Heaven
Yeah, and some like it moderate and some like a lot of it
Whichever way I go we got somethin' to get you move up out of it
Some will be statistics and some will be reverends
Dimes become pennies like dimes become eleven
To some we kind of thought of it, as teaching the dumb
Ace-One and dilated, the shape of things to come

I catch rec and tangle in circles with squares
Triangles to test if indeed you're prepared
This is the shape of things to come
This is the shape of things to come

I catch rec and tangle in circles with squares
And triangles to test if indeed you're prepared
This is the shape of things to come
This is the shape of things to come

I wax 'em I tax 'em, here's Iriscience, ask him
From Arkansas to Aspen, the futuristic jazzmen
I'm telepathic, movin' through hella traffic
I know my demographics, see how this was crafted and drafted
There's precision in the incision
I'm not Christian or Catholic or any other religion
I'm just man with a steel in his hand
I shoot the gift from blessed to spark where it land

And it landed in the sand where the pyramids blaze
And this is how the dictionary defines such a place
A polyhedron with a polygonal base
Median and common vertex, triangular face
Who came in the home and ripped the cats stole
Stripped the limestone to line they fine home
I cram to understand, their dirty deeds in song
While we bringing you the shape of things to come

I catch rec and tangle in circles with squares
And triangles to test if indeed you're prepared
This is the shape of things to come
This is the shape of things to come

Aiyyo, I center punch punchlines, shine when it's crunch time
I back to beat box, rap battles at lunchtime
I sketch a piece and fill it in with design
Ooh no, Aceyalone, raw bright like sunshine
Platform squad, standin' on the brink
Yo I touch the world, got three but two blink
Rakaa aka Iriscience lenscrafters
And blend with hash the self defense master

Yeah, it's too bad we control fire, wind
I know that you bad you batted a thousands I remember
Who's the baddest with the apparatus tell me again
Take ahold of your heart without penetratin' the skin
See I didn't invent it, I just perfected it
I never intended to really connect with it
But once I got in it, I redirected it
Now I change the world and get respect with it and a check with it

It ain't nothin' new under the sun
Fool, I ain't afraid of the size of your gun
The flesh is weak plus they speak foul tongue
Take the breath from their lungs as they swung
And they hung and they sunk

I catch rec and tangle in circles with squares
And triangles to test if indeed you're prepared
This is the shape of things to come
This is the shape of things to come

I catch rec and tangle in circles with squares
And triangles to test if indeed you're prepared

Aceyalone,"All right
Yo, this song came about one time when
I- I was- I was on a plane back, going back to Los Angeles
Coming from somewhere else
And I sat next to this lady and she was telling me something
I don't remember it verbatim, 
But I do remember some of the things she said
It was like this

Life as we know it is about to change
I smell it within the air
The weather is getting strange
Drugged up, sedated and
Numb from the pain
The sickness in America has spread to her brain
She is no longer fit to make good decisions
She is completely blind and void of any vision
She parties hard and she keeps her conscious mind imprisoned
Therefore she's headed for the ultimate collision
She can no longer hide the scars on her face
The innocence now gone is hard to replace
She has no shame, no remorse or any grace
She embraces the devil and she hates over race
Ms. America, the beautiful the free
Fallen within the cracks, I wish that you could see
She buried her misery, within society
It's obvious, you have no regard for me

Caught up in the belly of America
Lost, in the stomach of America
Broken down, in the bowels of America
Sinking, in the garbage of America
Stuffed, in the brain of America
Suffering, in the body of America
Lying, in the wicked spirit of America
Dying, in the old soul of America

Ms. America, you've been a very bad girl
You nearly disgraced humanity in the eyes of the world
Vanity has took you over, you're not deserving
The mirror image of your reflection is quite disturbing
She makes so many promises she couldn't keep
She neglected to mother her young, so they don't sleep
They scream out for justice, and then they weep
When out to blame Ms. America, that's what you reap
The audacity of your inventions to rule us all
The tragedy of your intentions to fool us all
You should have gave into nature and to the law
It's only a matter of time before you fall
The things you should of worked out in your first colony
Victim of your own advice and your psychology
You've destroyed all morale and the ecology
I'm sorry, but I don't accept your apology

Caught up in the belly of America
Lost, in the stomach of America
Broken down, in the bowels of America
Sinking, in the garbage of America
Stuffed, in the brain of America
Suffering, in the body of America
Lying, in the wicked spirit of America
Dying, in the old soul of America

Homeless America, so much attraction
Has yet to take ability for her actions
We work around within the system and make adaptations
You can let freedom ring, within your faction
How can people still be hungry, when there's a surplus?
Suffering within your home, you've made them worthless
Damn near police the state, you make us nervous
Even though some conform and join your service
You're presidency's the biggest joke, but we're the laugh
Always smell the gun smoke, on your behalf
I think I should send a telegraph to your staff
America you're down and dirty, you need a bath
So tell your secret agents, don't be paranoid
This wasn't taught by Socrates or Sigmund Freud
This is simply gods work, you can't avoid
Ever nation ever built has been destroyed

Caught up in the belly of America
Lost, in the stomach of America
Broken down, in the bowels of America
Sinking, in the garbage of America
Stuffed, in the brain of America
Suffering, in the body of America

Forty-five, fifty, fifty-five, sixty
Sixty-five, seventy, seventy-five ways

Today's in a maze
And start the craze
When they opened my coon
It was time to bloom

Thinkin' like ten people, trapped in one room
Sittin' in my sandbox, sand all over me
Overly anxious to get the mic in my hand
Now who want to blow it up (I do)
Now who can rip it up (I can)

I glide like the ride of a man on a snowboard
When they pick up the microphone I ask him what he flow for
Various degrees of technique that's inside of me
Never try to be something you not- and don't lie to me
Ebony and Ivory
Keys on my piano playin'
Tryin' to test some music, but the rhythm push my your hand away
Easy as the alphabet
Hard as solid rock
Pure as the driven snow
Pissin' on your block
Mark my territory then I'm right back in it when
laughin' w/ the teras of a clown when I grin

I'm manic-depresive ever since I was an adolescent
But I never panic in a sesion when I'm bussin'
Cussin' like a sailor, 
With a bottle full of Jagermeister
Ready for whatever this world has to offer me

Plus it won't get off of me
And never ever test me
I'm one w/ the universe
The energy has blessed me
Bet you wonder why you got flaws in your character
Cause you're caught in the ass-crack of America

I just want to help you all but
All I do is stare at ya
You can have a shot of this
Or maybe hit this marija
want to if you want to but
If not, stay drug-free
But, plug me in the mix boy
Right up next to plug three

Talkin' out the side of your neck it ain't a remedy
I just want the whole wide world to remember me
I don't want to have to think you're working for the enemy
Sbotage. You can't conquer this energy

You can be the center of attention if you want to
My party is in the other room and
We're just having fun too
(So I'd like to signify the monkey that's in back of you)
All I want to do is get rid of all the wack in you

Do not get offended because no I'm not attacking you
I don't have to do nothin', the rapper's start smackin' you
Maybe I should just give you a taste of reality
Welcome to my art show
Its not about a salary

Take two of these a day and burn a couple calories
Me and the mic are like Mickey and Malory
Rockin' like a be	-boy
Part of my anatomy
Hands on your groin'

Critical thinker of the formulas we all need

I think I'm running out of brain space in my hard-drive
Plus I need a memory-card for my control pack
Throw that hand up so I can see your finger-tips
I'm about to rip it up better than before

Yeah I had a crazy-people party and invited you
I didn't know my underground hip hop excited you
Now that I know this fact I'm gonna throw it right at you
I just want to give you everything you're entitled to
Down in the Leimert park, hangin' w/ the hooligans
Every now and then I've got to take'em back to school again
Maybe you should call me your hip hop counselor
I'll be on the rhythm when the beats start bouncin' up

I'll give you a minute just to get yourself together and
We can have a sing-along, all and together and
Here's  to the netherlands, sistern and brethren

Non-identical and non-contendable and still
I tell everybody: just do as you will
Cause the skills to pay the bills'll be the only thing that still wheel
Yeah, I know some people are akward, different, dope, what?
Special in they own way, artistically advanced
Resulting in a lifestyle enhanced by chance
Now that these records are made

Slightly slanted eyes

Candy-stripers, we paid the piper
That's why we're listenin
Windshield wipers and air conditioning
And bucket seats while we bumpin beats
I never want to meet the agony of defeat
I got a simple plan for a complicated issue
I'm a simple man with a complicated issue
And my potential, your potential, our potential
We can sho' nuff make a change and that's essential
Cause the bad boy murderer is on the path
And the bad girl Dragon Lady, she knows witch craft
She makes me laugh, at the same time she breaks my heart
She grabs a hold and she takes it apart

Bein a part of the art blazin from the spark

Cause I'm alive as I can be
Hip-hoppin body-rockin MC degree

I'm a pure bred with the paper and the pencil lead
I hit the nail on the head - off the head
Got a cold way of flowin, a old way of knowin
I'm a Boeing 747 in the wind blowin
I hang at the Chop Shop, gettin smarter
Got the futuristic Bop Hop, I'm ice water
I'm the grandson of Coltrane, the nephew of Miles
Charlie Parker told me: we left you the styles
My style is gorgeous, I flaunt it to pay the mortgage
I forge this past your Average Joes and Georges

Got to get my hike on and my half-pike on
Look, I'm out your rank, I'm out your class
Freestyle up the coastline a whole tank of gas
I hit the dank and pass, I spank that ass
You flow but I know for a fact you can't last
Your rhymes is weak, metaphores is dumb
Punchlines like you shootin rubber bullets at the sun
Some rappers carry straps and ten-gallon hats
But I carry a guillotine and carry em back
I carry out the plan with a detailed map
I carry a conversation and I carry these raps
I don't bury the hatch, I'm very detached
I marry this batch, yo, she knows where to scratch
I take long walks all the way to the bong shop

Aceyalone,"""(spoken)Yo, so you know, all of a sudden, we're in front of the 
restaurant and she decides she wants to leave on her own.  
And I'm  like ""Just go!"" you know?  And then she, 
she gotta get something out the car 
she gotta do this she gotta do that...(/spoken)

Yo she was always trying to fight me
Kick me and bite me
I used to argue with her daily and nightly
Trying to excite me, saying shit to spite me
She said ""I know it isn't another girl!"" I said ""It might be.""
There really wasn't but I said it cause she hyped me.
I know she loved me but she act like she don't like me
And started gradually just trippin' on me slightly
All of a sudden, she stopped acting politely
I said ""Just kiss me instead of trying to dis me.
'Cause when I'm gone you'll be hollering you miss me.
You should just love me instead of trying to shove me.
Try to hug me instead of trying to bug me.""
She beautiful but be acting like she ugly
I know she dug me but why the hell she drug me
Through all the drama talking 'bout that she can kill me?
Be flashing on me, turn around and say ""You feel me?""
I'm like ""Yo, you ain't always got to grill me
You better tighten up before somebody steal me.""

CHORUS:

Why you be acting up, why you be showing out?
Why you be talking all loud when we in the house?
What's with the attitude? Why you like to run your mouth?
I guess you really don't know what it's all about.
You gots to BOUNCE
Get your clothes and BOUNCE
Pack your bullshit and BOUNCE
Get your clothes and BOUNCE
Gimme everything and BOUNCE

She was always trying to hold me
Shape me and mold me.
I never knew and nobody ever told me
Trying to control me just because she know me
She said ""If you love me like you tell me then you show me!""
I had to tell her that I dealt with her solely
It didn't matter 'cause she treated me so coldly
Tried to talk with her but she blocked it like a goalie
We was lovers before we was homies
I said support me instead of trying to short me
Outvote me or root beer float me
Misquote me or even scapegoat me
And after all that insult me?

CHORUS

(spoken)You know, we used to be close now you want to badmouth me 
and talk to your friends all crazy about what I do...(/spoken)

She was always trying to clown me
Sink me or drown me
Outthink outdrink and out-of-bound me.
I used to leave but I hated when she found me
But she got to everyone in the townie
I tried to duck from the drama that surround me
It's in my blood, I'm a king you got to crown me
The way she flipped the script on me was astounding
""Who do you think about when you say who found me?""
I should have taught her everytime I fought her
I never caught her and never tried to salt her
I wonder why our relationship falter
I guess we both have the kind of life you can't alter.
People should make up instead of trying to break up
Or just break up cause that can be a wake up
And when you wake up make sure you take up
A little time so you don't make a mistake up.

I learned real early that life is hard
Sit down at the table, get dealt yo cards
Might get a good hand, could get a bad hand
The hood lands and bad lands done turned you to a mad man
Barely can sleep at night
Tryin to make the ends meet just to keep it tight
You want what he got but he ain't got much
It's a beautiful thang that you cannot touch

Well, it's the luck of the draw, some come up short
I know you want to keep your boat and you're bumpin afloat

Same old scenario
Sometimes it's just sour milk
In the hour of guilt your flowers wilt
And it's all in the power of what you built
You want to lie in your casket with gold and silk
As for I, wrap me in Kinte cloth
Give me my respect due and then step off

I learned real early that life was hard
Never ever shit in your own backyard
Never fake the funk or front to play the part
Be smart, live life love, respect the art
Cause people take kindness for weak and prey
And they take for granted when you say what you say
They take advantage of the fact you give your heart away
You should be able to see through these games people play
Cause people just use you, it just won't stop
You won't say nothin and it makes you hot
They say they're your friends but they really are not
Because they only out to try and get what you got
The Jones' - what a classic case
It can turn a nigga into a bastard case
I know they all runnin to see who is the fastest in the race
You might as well get on your knees and ask for grace
Cause many will lose but some will come in last place
And many get bruised but some get blasted in the face
Somebody once told me that people were strange
I never knew what it meant till I seen some people change
I know you really want it but it's out of your range
And if you plan to get it then you gotta take some pain
You gotta master the fear
You just say: ""Fear, come here,"" and drop a bug in his ear
And tell him to disappear, rid him, buy him a beer
No hard feelings but some people turnin the tricks
Some say it's just a natural pick
It's like Darwin's theory, but y'all don't hear me
Strong is how they skim me
Never with the gimme-gimme
Bottle water or a shot of Rémy?
My name is Ace One, baby, not Timmy
And you can get the jimmy

You get down right dirty on em hella quick
Put air in your tires, step into shit
Bust raps, caps, throw rocks or pick up a stick
How you gonna handle it when it get thick?
How you gonna handle it when it get thick?
How you gonna handle it when it get thick?
Get down right dirty on em hella quick

Give me five feet

I don't want nobody touchin' me unless it's my girls
I give a pound, a hug, some love, but that's that
Don't be tappppin' me on the shoulders
Or pattin' me on the back
Or pull on my arm
Checkin' my size
I'm liable to do you harm
My temple is my prize
I'm wise and on the real-ly
I ain't too touch feel-ly
If you put your hands upon me I might just smack you silly
It's a billion people--touch somebody else, touch yo'self
I'll be sure to get at you if I'm needin' your help
But until then, maybe when I'm dead and stiff
But to touch you wit'out touchin' you is one of my gifts

Why you tryin' to talk over the music when you know we barely can hear?
Why you tuggin' on my coattail, grabbin' on my sleeve?
Yo, cover your mouth when you cough 'round me
Don't touch me when you sneeze
I don't like disesase
And I don't want to give you what I got
Yeah I'll hit the weed but what I don't need
Is somebody always in my spot
Standin' where I'm standin'
Breathin' down my neck
Yo, have some respect
I guess you think that water ain't wet
Just back the fuck up
No, I ain't stuck up
I just don't want to hear your moans and groans and hiccups and stuff
And report it with the tape recorders all in my grille
But to touch you wit'out touchin' you is one of my skills

Now I'm 'a draw the lines in the ground and show you my square
It's at least arm's distance, so stand over there
Hey love, you know I miss you, and how we embrace
But I'll let you know if I want to kiss you or see how you taste
Yo, we all got issues we need to face
So don't think I'm tryin' to dis' you when I tell you the case
In case you're wonderin', it's just like that
I'm like there's telepathy
I already know what you're gonna say before you step to me
I hate croweded elevators in downtown rush
Packed trains
Craszy-ass people on the bus
Somtimes I roll plush
Lookin' so Cold Crush
But I'd rather teleport through space so y'all can bite my dust
Use body language baby
I can dig that
But homey you need to kick back and relax on the Ac'
The bottom line is don't invade nobody's zone
Or maybe owe

Aceyalone,"Yeah! And you don't stop
Now, once again Ace One is on the wax 
and this one goes out to everybody 
who experienced in their lifetime 
or going to experience in their lifetime some type of hardship
Because everybody goes through hardships

See hardship belongs to me
I will never give it away or sell it for a fee
I regret to inform you I will never set it free
Everyday I'm reminded of how hard it could be 
I take my pain just like a G
Got my struggle of life down to a T
It's nobody's fault but mine if I can't see
So I open my eyes and start looking for the key
Hardship is mine to hold onto
all through to the Yellow Brick Road it goes
My shoulders got the heaviest load but I pack light 
and I compensate I got act right when I conversate 
See some people relate but they don't understand the words
Some people can climb mountains but can't jump curbs 
and vice verse.  I know it's such a nice verse 
but hardship makes everything worse 
and worse is a reminder to stay on the path
But hardship is mine to have 
because hardship keeps me in check 
mainly so I can check myself I give up full respect 
because he's real like a hundred-dollar bill
Without hardship you wouldn't appreciate your meals
Without hardship I wouldn't appreciate my skills
And so I do and so I grew and so I knew 
that hardship not only makes most of my days blue 
but it teaches me how to struggle in the jungle 
and never crumble and how to remain humble
Some people they live life inside a glass case
Some people they live life in the vastness of space
And others will live long at a snail's pace
I live with hardship slapping me in the face

Because hardship belongs to me, 
I will never give it away or sell it for a fee
I regret to inform you I will never set it free
Everyday I'm reminded of how hard it could be

How hard it could be...
How hard it could be...

Yo whole rock this, look

Yo brown is my complexion, I got that electric connection
Now who needs some protection?
We rocking hip-hop, come in and turn your gun off
Gave you the mic and off the head you couln't come off
I only say it cause nobody wants to shoot ya
I'd rather teach you science and work on the future
Aceyalone ain't not a phoney not by any means
And by any means necessary be supreme
I am the poet to flow with and get lyrical
I write songs like smokey and the miracles
I'm from l.a., city of the big bang
But everywhere around the world they screaming ""get thangs!""
And at the same time I'm screaming out ""I want mine!""
It ain't nothing really new under the sunshine
But sometime you got to put away the fun time
Get it cause you only living one time, I got to have it

The wind underneath my wings (I got to have it!)
Money and fancy things (I got to have it!)
The food for my family to eat (I got to have it!)
The raps that can ride these beats (I got to have it!)
My own piece of this earth (I got to have it!)
For everything life is worth (I got to have it!)

I got to have it in the 2 triple o
It's either work nine to five or you rip a flow
Or rob a nigga, but how low can you go?
I ain't a thief, I just want relief for sho'
I got to get mine, no different from everybody trying to get theirs
So I was getting prepared
Instead of spitting shots through the air, maybe getting the chair
Yeah I got ta got ta, have it have it
Like peas and carrots, broccoli and cabbage
Bread and butter, now did I stutter?
Don't you utter another word, you mouth is in the gutter
And I can't take it, don't want nothing from you
And I can't stay, I got this bitch something to do
And it's more important than michael jordan
Or operah winfery or billy cosby
To the death like a kamikaze, huh, I got to have it

See I want everything that I don't have
So don't laugh when I tell you that I want half
But I don't want your half, I just want my half
And on my behalf, put it on a phonograph
Cd's tapes, packaged with a photograph
And respect the ancestors when we walk the path
Talk the math, speaking like a genuine
Bless the gods, bless the mic, and then you rhyme
And keep it going until you end up at the finish line
And when you see the light beaming, then it's time
We kick a four or ? ? ? this without a space ship
Don't want to take your life, I know I can't replace it
So while you're sitting around the house getting wasted
You know you're not using your full potential now you're facing
And plus, ain't nothing wrong with riding the bus
So put on your nikes and kick rocks, I got to have it

[Verse One]
See I never really new life could be so hard
I never really new pain til I got scared
I never knew people could be so cold
I never knew wrong til I was ten years old
I never knew fighten til I got my ass kicked
I never knew gettin' got til I got tricked
I never knew healthy til I got sick
And I never knew people killed people so quick
Yo, I never knew mind power could be so deep
And I never knew hardship was mine to keep
And I never knew the wolves attack the sheep in their sleep
And I never knew people played people so cheap
Yo, I never knew that we was in such bad shape
And I never knew what I would have to do for the papes
And I never knew that I would put my life on tape
And I never knew hip hop would be my escape
See I never knew real folks could be so few
And I never knew so many people don't got a clue
And I never knew beautiful til I met you
But, never say never because it never comes true

[Verse Two]
Hey yo, I never knew that some nigga's just don't bury beef
I never knew that I brought you so much grief
I never knew that you was a two time thief
The way you stole my heart was beyond belief
Yo, I never knew my medicine would come in a leaf
And I never knew that life could be so brief
And I never knew that I would get no relief
I never knew so many Indians that want to be chief
Yo, I never knew the wrong move could cost yo life
And I never knew the wrong move could cause yo strife
And I never knew money could just buy you fun
And I never knew so much power came with a gun
Yo, I never knew that I would have such bad luck
And I never knew the next man could get you stuck
And I never knew lighting til I got struck
And I never knew that you would go so low for the buck
Yo, I never knew real folks could be so few
And I never knew so many people don't got a clue
And I never knew beautiful til I met you
But, never say never because it nver comes true

[Verse Three]
See, I never knew the future would be like the past
And I never knew a woman could just slang that ass
Yo, I never knew that you were so sassafras
I never knew that you played the game so fast
I never knew that there was no time to waste
And I never knew no one who could take your place
Yo, I never knew reality til you showed me a taste
And I never knew how you made my heart beat race
Yo, I never knew courage until I got brave
And I never knew discipline until I behaved
And I never knew freedom until I became a slave
And I never knew that I would take this to the grave
Yo, I never knew that I had so much to lose
And I never knew I had so many to choose
And I never knew an ego was so easily bruised
And I never knew the game until I studied the rules
See I never knew real folks could be so few
And I never knew so many people don't got a clue
And I never knew beautiful til I met you
But never say never because it never comes true 
(true, true)

Never say never because it never comes true
I never knew that I would be about the revenue
Never say never because it never comes true
Oh, I never knew that you didn't know what they was telling you
Never say never because it never comes true
I never knew this about the heaven and the hell in you (ha yeah)

When you see somebody stumbling when they walk by
Tell 'em ""hey kid, walk straight, master your high"" -> Slick Rick
Droolin from the mouth with them bloodshot eyes
Tell 'em ""hey kid, walk straight, master your high""
You took a half of shrooms and now you bout to cry?
""Hey kid, walk straight, master your high""
Can't remember a thing no matter how hard you try
""Hey kid, walk straight, master your high""

First you start mumbling
Then you start stumbling
Then your motor skills start malfunctioning
Could it be the intake
Of the chemical that makes your body shake
All over, so critical
First one running to the bar
To get a drink
First one hanging out the car
Chunky pink
Really paralyzed, numb up and sedated
Moving with that rubber band body when you faded
Smoke about an ounce of weed
Drank ten beers, it's just a
Matter of time before you start getting the fears
You can't steer? (you can't steer?)
You can't hear? (you can't hear?)
You ain't here, you can't steer clear?
You want to go home?

[Chorus]
When you see somebody stumbling when they walk by
Tell 'em ""hey kid, walk straight, master your high"" (->Slick Rick, 'Hey
Young World' (I think))
Droolin from the mouth with them bloodshot eyes
Tell 'em ""hey kid, walk straight, master your high""
You took a half of shrooms, you think you gon die?
""Hey kid, walk straight, master your high""
Can't remember a thing no matter how hard you try
""Master your high""

First you smoke indo
Then some chocolate
But the gin and juice got you skyrocketing
Yo, can I get a Long Island?
Who got the bud?
Now you want to lay it down
In the club
You supposed to be a thug drinking thug passion
But you can barely push it to the house
Without crashing
Now, you know better
Than getting that saucy
Trying to mix tequila
With kamekaze and bossy (?)
Fudge brownies
With ganja butter
Then you want to hit the bone?
Your eyes flutter
Yo, she had a happy face
On her ecstacy
She started touching her private place
While she standing next to me
You shoulda had one drink
Like your girl
Now you in the bathroom
Calling Earl
Oh, now you got the spins,
The head-twirls
Underestimate your high
It rocked your world

[Chorus]
When you see somebody stumbling when they walk by
Tell 'em ""hey kid, walk straight, master your high"" (->Slick Rick, 'Hey
Young World' (I think))
Droolin from the mouth with them bloodshot eyes
Tell 'em ""hey kid, walk straight, master your high""
You took a half of shrooms and now you bout to cry?
""Hey kid, walk straight, master your high""
Can't remember a thing on the acid fry
""Master your high""

First you need oxygen
For circulation
Then you need agua
Rejuvination
Maybe you should eat something
But nothing spicy
Maybe try a cold thai
Nice and icy
Now you can't leave here
You can barely open doors
Maybe take a shower
Open your pores
Just try to shake it off
Have some activity
Get your shit together
Then come back to the festivities
I'm not saying don't get high
'cause that's on you
I'm just saying if you don't get high
Then what to do?
See, my friend right here
Can hold his liquor
But my friend right here
Is getting sicker
So, he started beef with my homie over what?
Took this fool to the house
To sober up
Maybe you should listen up,
Heed the warning
Or you gonna wake up sick as fuck
In the morning

I was born in the jungle, the concrete slab
Where people take any and everything that they can grab
Some niggas chilled on the block, but chilled in the lab
My project was to blow you up and break you off a slab
People are strange, and people are bad
But the gift of gabrier was something beautiful to have
It started at the good life, house of the first sightin'
We snatched raps out of they mouths when they were biting
There was nothing more exciting then to serve and perform
On Crenshaw and Exposition God was born
He said please pass the mic to whomever is tight

I gotta serve you in a cipher just to ear my stripes
The scared battle dog, with the underground catalogue
Fuck it, tryin' to make the world a better place
Instead of duckin', still tryin' to make the ducktes
Make the knowledge rain down in buckets
Make a little somethin', and tuck it, just to give it away
Build a work shop round where I stay

Some people know the way, but they don't know what to say

And you figure out the truth it's quite shockin
To see the mic rockin, beat knockin
They throwin punches but I'm blockin
I hit the open gash and I clock em
Rock em, sock em, my only intention
Is the off-the-ground suspension
With the decision for mid-air collision 
Crash! That's my intention
All that means is smash a rapper, bash a rapper, rapper slash
Remember what happened last time a rapper flashed?
To throw flames he forgot that hell was hot
No brains, you just parked your car in Salem's lot
And Sky-Cam knows who I am
The shots will be aimed at you, helpless lamb

I hold it down (serve and protect)
Blow up the spot (serve and protect)
Take you out (serve and protect)
The mic is mine (serve and protect)
The time is now (serve and protect)
I speak the word (serve and protect)
Close your mouth (serve and protect)
And that's my job (serve and protect)

[ VERSE 2 ]
Statistics say linguistics pay
My mystic display made em insist that I stay
Huh, I'm on the level where I meditate and levatate
And dedicate every awaken day so I can celebrate
My last drink of water, my last piece of bread
I'm the last bullet in the chamber aimed at your head
Stranger, cause you thought I was better off dead
Not shot out of anger but duty instead
Look, me and you rappers got one common thread
We both speak the language so you know what I said
The spot only grounds where I bled
The tracks are my tears from the love that I spread
Grieve no more when you breathe no more
Do you believe in happiness or believe in war?
Speak no more, talk no more
I open up my pour-through and I walk through the door

[ CHORUS ]

[ VERSE 3 ]
Better calm your nerves before you get served
For sure I give you what you deserve
And then some, I win some, I win some
I win some, I win some, I hold em for ransom
Has nothin to do with bein handsome
When I enhance em
I dance em around like a marionette
I bet, then string em along like a pet
Poodle, walk the dog but get stopped in your tracks
Shake the ground and you drop to your back
The uncontrollable urge for me and the beats emerge
Sends a surge of shockwaves through my words
And you are my target
I got a infinite amount of ammunition just to spark it
In the end all you heard was a scream
Diggin as dug in the concrete, a disappearing dream
And don't tell me how it seems

To hold it down (to serve and protect)
To blow up the spot (to serve and protect)
To take you out (to serve and protect)
The mic is mine (to serve and protect)
The time is now (to serve and protect)
I speak the word (to serve and protect)
Close your mouth (to serve and protect)
That's my job (to serve and protect)

I'm a be	-boy, I'm the real McCoy
I'm chocolate all over like an Almond Joy

What's up party people in the place to be
Gather round for a minute and check the MC
I really don't know what you expectin from me
But I was born and raised to rock over the beat
See, me and my homies got some tight-ass raps
It is time we put the hometeam back on the map
All you radio stations play a whole lotta crap
It's like I'm hungry at the table and you feedin me scrap
So this one's for the people who can ride the wave
And go into the battle and come out unscathed
See, my only regret is that I probably never gave
Enough back to hip-hop for the life it saved
So ride along with us as we lick this shot
For anybody who put it down, we never forgot
See, we give it all we got, cause it's how we was taught
And it only takes a second just to blow up the spot

I'm a be	-boy, I'm the real McCoy
I'm chocolate all over like an Almond Joy		(5X)

[ Abstract Rude ]
We keep it lit like weed, indeed the rare breed
They barely did enough of us for their needs
Our fans, some r&b, most hip-hop and rave
I'm dark-skinned, baby, and I get you sun-bathed
Once the track's laid that Jissm made
I become a slave to the beat, don't know how to behave
We kept it true, what else did you expect us to do?
Now I'm beggin you to come and spin a record or two
I'm on the prowl in the here and now I'll be cold
 
To you so-called MC's who want to get bold
You'll be showed in the worst ways
I'm seasoned for battle cause of Project Blowed Thursdays
I'm a wordsmith, now that we've settled into two thou
(Two thou) we gotta represent somehow (somehow)
It's talent in the ghetto that we'll have to employ
With melanin in em they'll seek to destroy

[ Aceyalone ]
Cause we was at the party when the jam was live
And it really wasn't poppin until we arrived
We was hangin out at the club before we can drive
With big afros like the Jackson Five
Comin out the house late, makin it home safe
be	-boys in the place, just had to show my face
Soon after that I discovered my instrument
As soon as I picked her up we got intimate
Big up to my homeboys who know this tune
Microphone Mike and my man T-Spoon (Heavyweight)
Aceyalone just stepped in the room
Now we know the flavor's in here the party resumes

[Aceyalone]
People all over the world
They have a right to be free
No matter where you are at
You are in the place to be
I think you should walk to the park
And stand up right next to a tree
Look down at the roots on the ground
And imagine you're standin with me
An apple might fall on yo' head
And you may get a bright idea
That you do not want to be led
You'll climb on your own up that hill
But when you get up to the top
Just don't forget from where you came
Cause you know that it doesn't stop
And you know the name of the game

[Aceyalone]
I had the pleasure of finding this treasure
And taking the measure to keep it protected
Jewels are a snake that can be in the wrong hands
That could be deadly we MUST take a stance
Walking on tightropes in thin ice and hot coals
And dancing with demons, and playing the role
Stay in control and don't let them control you
Cause I know they will, if you have no will
That's one of the reasons I came to this planet
To give you some lessons on you being you
It must be us that must enter those gates and
We must know just what to do

[Chorus]

[Aceyalone]
First I grab my, weapon then I
Put it away just in case there's foul play
Ready and willin and deadly and makin a killin
A to the L, on to the E
As you can tell, I'm the MC
of the century and of the future
When I execute ya, you'll feel no pain
But you will when you'll be born again and again
Ev-ery seven or eight thousand years
The brain becomes one with the ears
Man becomes one with the sneers
The flesh becomes one with the gears
The circuitry's working, electronic pulse
I am the host so a toast to the boogie

Second rule of Art Club, there is no Art Club
Walkin around, talkin to myself
But you're only crazy if you answer back and the chances of that
are high enough to scrape the sky, me myself and I
My inner battles are way more excitin than the ones I have on the mic

Dissectin it, overstandin it and perfectin it
And protectin it, it's become my drive
The more it gets to be heard, the longer it stays alive
My Art, Club

We meet daily, we sleep rarely, we bend barely
Fairly new, very artsy, very artsy
Do not disturb the session in progression
Just my teachers, and students and employees
And a map of the world, I could rap to the world, destroy MC's
Let it be noted that, no one man can hold it
Most overloaded and folded under the pressure
To carry hot stones is an honor, and a duty
Most difficult task, last shall be first to get the treasure
Storm weather, warm weather
And rainy nights, my Art Club built of solid steel
And one diamond light

Yeah you know
Your interpretation of artists you know
Will always be in the forefront of the world's..
future, it's past, imagination why'know
Yeah it's true, aight..

I refuse to take part, in any lesser art - felt
Break your little hip-hop art and watch you melt
First assignment, evoke the path, provoke the future
Choke and strangle your Devil before he shoots ya
full of serum to fear him
But my Club supports the God so it's difficult to hear him
We meet, over the beat, bring your drum machines and (?)
Dem days fly by fast, meditating with the sensei
Be forever in debt with the powers that be
My solid steel integrity, kills a celebrity
So let it be, we shall fulfill our destiny

Of course looks can be deceiving.

Break you down like kempo, I'm trained in the arts

I specify in rockin my page from the heart
I dig down deep within my psyche
Information excites me, the knowledge invites me
When I, throw on my Nike's and step to it nicely
Huh, it's unlikely any man could out-mic me
Lightning, please strike me like it did when I was a child
Hit me with a hundred thousand volts and make me smile
You name it I can aim it, catch it and tame it, explain it
Take it and paint it in beautiful technicolor
Directly from another place you could expect no other
To stand by these trues and break these rules
We defy the laws of cool and sang these blues and bring this news

Them dirty fingers, reachin for the scepter
All up in yo' head but I'm not Dr. Lector
Or Dr. Phil, but I still got to kill

Blow up, everything that's holdin up your hat

What kind of little box you thinkin in?  Think again
Draw a blank, you saw a tank
But didn't see my soldiers on the flank movin up another rank
The Hip-Hop Hall of Fame went up in flames
When they, mention my name it's tension in they brains
An extension of the game and, I stake this claim
And break these chains and this one's for the last train

I'm the jack of all trades, master of one
And the thing I mastered is blastin this mic gun
Put it to your temple, and pop yo' pimple
Break you down like kempo, I'm trained in the arts

We got one verse left to rock this beat
And separate the good shit from the weak
So, get in the groove, and feel the sound
And once you're inside spread yourself around
From the bottom to the top, top, to the bottom
I'm, gonna rock 'em, while, I still got 'em

Cause you're lookin down at me like I'm two feet small

Tired and hungry but haven't forgot
Guns and shots, runs and drops
Or buried alive under tons of rocks
A beautiful day, a wonderful night
A suitable pastime just rockin the mic
A day in the life, a life in a day
You know when they comin so you might get away
Space and time, nickels and dimes
Bass and rhyme that tickle your spine
A brand new mind, a fresh design
One of a kind, seek and you find
Homies and crews, weapons and tools
Lovers and haters and teachers and fools
Just try walkin one day in my socks and shoes

And then I go at 'em all, with unviersal laws
Bigger they come, the harder they gotta fall

Bigger they come, the harder they fallin'
It ain't, nothin' but the soundboys brawlin'
If you listen close in you can hear the reaper callin'
(HEY HEY) Bigger they come, the harder they fall

Now any bad boy can be destroyed and anybody can get hit
Even if you hard, harder than, hard can get
You think you'll never be defeated not even a little bit
Because you hard, harder than, hard can get
I mean you too big, too bad, ""2 Legit 2 Quit""
Because you hard, harder than, hard can get
You, try on a bad face, OH WHAT A PERFECT FIT
Because you hard, harder than, hard can get

Yo, yo yo - check it out
Yo back in the elementary school had a fight with the king of the class
I wasn't in the mood for getting beat up so I had to kick his ass!
I'm sick of bein bashed, lick a shot and lick it fast
Sooner or later the Gods and the Devils have to clash
Braveheart, gave his heart so he could save his country
Me I want to save the art to start before they hunt me
Whatcha momma taught you HUH? Whatcha momma teach you (HUH?)
Don't know why I fought you, don't know why I beat you
STAND UP to the systematic automatic controller
Robotic, hypnotic, great psychotic ruler
Never give an easy win and NEVER take a draw for..
Bigger they come, the harder they gotta fall

Bigger they come, the harder they fallin
Bigger they come, the harder they fallin
Bigger they come, the harder they fallin
Bigger they come, the harder they, fall

Bigger they come, the harder they fallin'
It ain't, nothin' but the soundboys brawlin'
If you listen close in you can hear the reaper callin'
(HEY HEY) Bigger they come, the harder they fall

Bigger they come, the harder they fallin
It ain't, nothin but the soundboys brawlin
Harder they come, the harder they fallin

Rougher they come, the harder they fallin

I woke up in a dream today
To the cold of the static
And put my cold feet on the floor
Forgot all about yesterday
Remembering I'm pretending to be where I'm not anymore
A little taste of hypocrisy
And I'm left in the wake of the mistake
Slow to react
Even though you're so close to me
You're still so distant, and I can't bring you back

It's true, the way I feel
Was promised by your face
The sound of your voice
Painted on my memories
Even if you're not with me
I'm with you
(You, now I see, keeping everything inside)
With you
(You, now I see, even when I close my eyes)
With you
(You, now I see, keeping everything inside)
With you
(You, now I see, even when I close my eyes)
With you
Ugh!

I hit you and you hit me back
And we fall to the floor
The rest of the day stands still
Fine line between this and that
But when things go wrong, I pretend the past isn't real
Now I'm trapped in this memory
And I'm left in the wake of the mistake
Slow to react
Even though you're close to me
You're still so distant, and I can't bring you back

It's true, the way I feel
Was promised by your face
The sound of your voice
Painted on my memories
Even if you're not with me

I won't let you control my fate while I'm holding the weight of the world on my conscience
(No)
I won't just sit here and wait while you weighin' your options
Your makin' a fool of me

You didn't dare to try and say you don't care
And solemnly swear not to follow me there

It ain't like me to beg on my knees
Or, please oh baby please

No I'm not upset, no I'm not angry

You'll never forget me, I'm keeping you with me

I won't let you take me to the end of my row
Or keep burning and torching my soul

No I'm not your puppet
And no, no, no, I won't let you go

With a six shooter computer eyes and a beautiful view of this world
Hold on tight when you, take your flight and sooner or later

I can leap over a buildin with the greatest of ease
Get up and rock the party like you wouldn't believe
Get everybody goin they'll be gone with the wind
Go all around the world come back and do it again
I can really rip a rapper for whatever it's worth
And introduce you to the greatest show on earth
Oh it's beautiful, isn't it?  I had it since birth
And it feels so incredible when I'm puttin in work
It's like I'm headed for heights, I'm ready to fight
They said it be light, they said it be bright
I said am I right, now what's the use of rockin my boat
Well any way you rock it I'ma keep it afloat
It's like I fly in the ocean, I swim in the sky
I'm live in a stereo, I'm so energized
For all of you guys, and all of you gals
This is what they sayin when they hearin them styles

Off the head to head, born to dead
Arm Leg Leg Arm back to Head
Hmm, infrared, telescopic
Audio'll transmit fiberoptics
The speed of sound, in full surround
A full metal jacket with a new compound
Amplified, deep and wide
Jump into your ride and lean to the side
Lo and behold I hit the Project Blowed road
Headed for the mountaintop, lookin for gold mode
I sold the gold but never sold the form
It's hot it's cold it's warm throughout the storm
Freakazoids, electric ladies
Radioactive robotic babies
Fuel-injection and dual exhausts
A cable antenna when the signal is lost

[Verse Three]
All up in your circuit breaker, doin my thing
Yo crank it to the maximum oh WHAT a machine
Movin in slow-mo, not makin a fuss
All of a sudden when they push the button I get a rush I'm gone
Climbin up the walls y'all, under your skin
I know it's gonna happen but I'm wonderin when
So I pace myself, and brace myself
Just in case myself, want to try to get away from me
My main objective, remain effective
Fuse together rhythms that'll keep you connected
Misdirected, disengaged
Disinfected, a brand new page
Hit the corners and hug the curbs
Smash on the gas that's all you heard
Check the monitors, heatin up thermometer
Live wire kiss and you Twist like Oliver

Make em' bounce an ounce on my lap
And that's a rap, that's a rap (that's a rap, that's a rap)

And for the people that believed in me, thanks a lot
I owe it all to you, everythang I got
I'm glad I could be here to open up shop
And glad I made it past twenty-six without gettin shot

Ladies and gentlemen, good people
Yeah, good brothers good sisters on deck

Dig this, peep the twist
Hand over fist, handstand on the cliff
Layin' stiff, expand on the gift
Uplift the masses, and pass me the spliff

It's a love thang, it's a hate thang
It's a great thang, Cali, to the state of mang
It's a world thing, and I'm a soldier
Always a war goin' on, it's never over
I make music, for the people
Who try to live a good life and keep it peaceful
And be resourceful, and keep achievin'
Every season, we represent the reason
I'm from the fellowship, I'm from the projects
I tell all access is the object
It's to beautiful, it's so painful
I do the work, and don't forget where I came from

[Chorus]
The saga continues
On the road again
To different venues
We rescue
We step true

Because we got that soul

What you gonna do about it?
What you gonna be about it?



",The Saga Continues,2003
Aceyalone,"In front of the mic, behind the limelight
A star so bright shines refined advancement
Dance with the last man on the face of the earth
Who did the electric slide over the verse
Hands held high, connect the antennas
Do or die when we fly, face the grimace
Yeah let's get this off you ready, Fast Eddie
Drop a load on 'em, wrong folks got a hold on 'em
Put the Blowed on 'em, roll on 'em
Roll over 'em, no control over 'em, over me
Outwardly, inwardly, openly, awkwardly
Happily, dastardly, tragedy and casualty
Same story same flight

Where they put yo' body same strip same spite, same endin'
Same car, same endin', same tension brewin'
Give me the steel, what the fuck is you doin'?
You done enough it's not enough, act two
I'm runnin' up it's not a bluff, I'm bout to crack you
Nonchalant, idiots about no comp
Romp, with the big guys, stomp all the pies
Kick the box, light these M-80's
Ladies grab your babies, run for safety

I don't think it may be a, good idea to stand here
You have no idea of what the fuck'S about to land here
Smart bombs, J-DAMS, bring mayhem
Hold up, god damn, it's just a party
Dirty red carpet and you walk by me wobbly
Obviously, oblivious, frontin' snobby

Heat to the Mojave, heat to the robbery
Beat, to the rhymin', each, brother probably
Taxpayers killer the mayor, and the senator
Rhyme sayers say a prayer, see a minister
Drinks are on the house, the house is on the hill
The hills are on FIRE, it started in the fields
Smoke inhalation, no ventilation
No fire station, no assimilation

Minus the heroes and plaques memorial sites
Become burial sites, from high aerial flights
Hover over David Blaine, I'm here to save the game
Fifty-two pick-up witcha brain
Alone lies the man on the track
Lonely as the dagger in my back, staggerin' forwards
Fallin' face flat, still spittin at you
Still gettin' at you, they're all laughin' at you
My greatest gift of all was the ability to fall
Get back up and fall, get back up and fall
Get back up and fall and crawl and get back up and brawl
And make 'em lick the balls

Now the dagger's in my back pocket, I hear the track I rock it
Pull your arm outta socket, reachin' for the cockpit
Rock shit, roll shit, control shit
Hold shit down 'til we slow on some old shit
I'll stick the pin in your neck just to earn respect
Stuff the paper in your mouth if I have to spell it out
Or write it on yo' forehead cause that's what I'm about
Run the route, bring water to the drought
When all else fails on the trails of love
Hate becomes judged, happiness won't budge

Wickedness does just as wickedness does
And I'm just gettin' above, I'm sayin' it just because I can
Just because I am a man
With the, hand that fit it and the teeth marks embedded
But God's hands, grip tight, and don't forget it
The evil in your heart is, misery's home
Where ugly is bred and grown, I refuse

I defuse the bomb but just for a moment
And like out of nowhere comes yo' worst opponent
The first ones on it, the last to leave
All my, trash is treasure, that's how it's perceived
At the end of my spin when the heights achieved
I'ma leave with a bang like how I was conceived
There's thieves in the temple with tricks up they sleeve
But no, fuck that!",Takeoff,2003
Aceyalone,"Aceyalone:
It's not a problem that I can't fix
'cause I can do it with my bag of tricks
they're playing for keeps and for kicks
but they're building with popsicle sticks instead of bricks
the time ticks, the atmosphere gets thick
I breathe in, it makes me sick to my stomach
if you got any kind of fix I want it
sometimes I think the attic's haunted
but it's not, it's just me
so I keep strutting and keep pushing my buttons
but I'm not about to be pushed over the edge
I made this pledge
not by you, my brother or by Sister Sledge
now I know that I'm not your boss
and I'm not trying to floss or come across lost
I wipe the frost until the glass is clear
and I exhaust the possibilities of showing fear
'cause the bigger the scare, the heavier the tear
and the wetter the drop and then you flood the crops
and we just don't want to be flooded
we cut it when we can't cut it we strutted we stay budded up
we keep it up and cut it up until we gotta shut up

Chorus (x2):
Haiku De Tat, make my music for the people who want to get down

Abstract Rude:
It ain't a lunch time I like to miss
I ain't a punch line type lyricist
and if you had beef you'd fight with your fists
my people suffer from lack of knowledge and righteousness
streets so wild we developed a frown
and a keen sense for knowing when it's going down
play it cool
say some shit that surprise me, my face don't change
serious 'bout them chips like a poker game
I come frequently like these Oakland trains
I freestyled it in a show and never wrote it the same
Aaron Pointer came to reign and say something
Eddie Hayes stays a little ways from me
the west side combination is legendary
home studios, cause by any means necessary
completed projects is my productivity
gimme food smoke and electricity
and if the power is ever cut off
I got a generator up in the loft
to stay energized, my music finds a way
to survive through the times and with the kinds today
L.A., what a wild place to be
styles by Ab, Mike Troy, and A.C.E.

Chorus

Mikah 9:
Indeed, indeed, Haiku De Tat what we could do witcha'
men at peace for y'all to call entities 
quicker on the draw the sickest thing that you ever saw
so for all our trees grow and grows in my backyard
remember me, sometimes I like to act hard
that's just it, it's an act but don't confuse that
if you choose to chit chat with a mack fully packed
you're bruised, black, blue and blurple
you'd never get a chance to bust back
I don't have to be rappin' or dancin' in a circle
to make the people react
I could be enjoying the be	-boying
I'm already on the map and made my money living fat
no need to profile and flash stacks
I'm way past that
Master Card and a little cash for snacks
munchies, after partaking from breaking nugs
down out of fat bud stash stacks
ahh, I do my floor work on linoleum
exploring the crevices of my woman's ass crack
I rhymin' in the SF studio on Napoleon
and I really love this jazz track
I'm running game now I'mma win
I'm on my last lap
you want to dance with me?
fast tap chance jacking for ASCAPs, checks, advance
and that's wack, I mash back

But they ain't gone get them
'Cause they got a window
All exits not seized
So they fled

Find personal seeds

Under the odd star

Or my look a like
It's looking like
It ain't looking too good
So I looked where I stood
Then I looked up
What a wonderful world
To have at my disposal
And those who know
If you abuse it
Then you lose it
But who's is it to begin with?
We started god-like
Now what's it gonna end with?
And we won't stop there

Non compos mentis and moon struck

To this relentless, yes, the sun
rises and sets yet you see none
of it's effects until it's done
then you'd reflect on how you'd run
I'd take a step, your momentum 
I had still kept, fool

[Abstract Rude]
they eat then they want to smoke then they eat food
repetitive cycle 'til I feel in the mood
other crews can't copy, they ain't got the magnitude
I hit 'em up, a heavyweight, they call 'em Ab Rude
this is not simply just to downplay wishes
made by emcees who found they status
do what you do to live life lavish
have this cabbage, heavy baggage

[Aceyalone]
Well I would like to start by saying
life has to be sparked each day
and night, got to be smart don't play
your time, you won't be back
when I speak I slice the words up like a slasher
private party crasher, dasher, rational thinker
sparkle a twinkle, third eye glimmer
sky swimmer
I like to let it simmer 'til the lights get dimmer
and I like talking about dilemma
and come up with a solution for the pollution
my contribution being the superior being at emceeing
and seeing the light love being in the light
but they snatch it like a thief in the night

checks not cash knots
she also gotta keester half this poultry up that twat
the rest will go up to other how's tickling the G-spot

you could smuggle me a key

ain't we having a car come pick us up?
the life of a star come hook us up
studios, stages and the streets, bomb beats
pages of loose leaf, blazing the keef
courageous, the truth speaks louder than lies
so when they hear you style they be proud of you guys
search from land to land
go from a thousand to a hundred to ten
and couldn't find an honest man
it ain't always what it's promised to be

or yell it loud 'til your voice hoarse

and sometimes it don't come at all

depending on exactly where you from

and be able to be mobilized and look over the skies

and freedom of man original with the tan
can I expand? can I feel the crowd?
if you don't want me to touch you then, uhh, speak up now
yeah, I keep my eyes on the owl and the sparrow
and the eagle and the hawk

Let your mind be free let your heart and your soul 
Just grow and let your life succeed as you wind on down the road
and let it be open your eyes so you see
open up your ears and what appears it's something true and clear
and I hear transprojection is love metaphysically here it is
I'll keep it in my soul, so I will show no fear were transmitted
I'm loud and clear as for those who see the light
behind the rhymes of Mikah 9 they know the time
And I see you and you make it through some of you don't hear me
All I can say is it's all love and that's the way it gotta be
Must we rob, rape, and murder one another for eternity?
As concerned to me
I would much rather we try to help each other
Allthe way down the road but almost every time I turn around
I hear the sound of bullet rounds fly through air
I'm well aware we're not prepared to
have conversation with celestial anatomy 
of Hereon and day by day we study in astronomy
and converse in astrology and Hereon
Live my days so let's partake so let's all take flight
We used to love light to guide your way through fright
and all of those spy satellites

Aceyalone,"It was so beautiful
Remember how in love we were?
So in love.
So in love.
Once.
So in love.
Once.

She was a young girl
I was a young man
And I knew they would get her when I let go her hand
And then I let go
The inevitable
So beautiful
And susceptible
So wonderful
And so innocent
And after this neither one of us would benefit
Yeah, I was a dropout
She was a graduate
She said I?ll never be nothing she wasn?t having it
Yeah, I tried to break her down
I tried to reason it
She said I wasn?t nobody to be believing in
Yeah, what a waste of time
What a waste of mind
Your place of mind was a part of the design
Yeah, I used to call her up
She never called back
When she called that said I wasn?t all that
Yeah, I know that times change
And people change, too
I was a fool just to think that I could change you

Everyone?s got stories gone
About a love we once knew
So high in the beginning
Until the world cuts through
And then everything changes
Nothing feels the same
Piece by piece it falls apart until
All that?s left is blame

And if I had a chance to do it all over I?d do it exactly the same

I was a be-boy
She was a good girl
Turned hot girl
Had to be a hood girl
Never did she notice she would end up in a shook world
I was like look girl it?s all in the book
Yeah, I used to tell her jokes
I used to make her laugh
And if I had a whole dollar I would give her half
So delicate
And so intelligent
And then she trying to play me out just for the hell of it
Back when she was 19 not even 21
Used to do a thing getting somebody anyone
Thought that she was naive
Or was it really me
I do believe
She was the one that was fulfulling me
So we broke up at a barbecue
Drove home thinking never will I bother you
Yeah, I just didn?t know
What it was hidden for
She had me sitting low
But she was bullshitting, though

Everyone?s got stories gone
About a love we once knew
So high in the beginning
Until the world cuts through
And then everything changes
Nothing feels the same
Piece by piece it falls apart until
All that?s left is blame

So I just kept rhyming
I caught her eye again
Next thing you know she was hollering let?s try again
But I wasn?t buying in
Didn?t want to lie again
Love was in the frying pan
Baby, it?s done
But she started hanging out
And started being seen
Seeing things different
Said she wasn?t being mean
Yeah, if I let her in
Then I let her win
But I?m a veteran what?s better than a friend
Maybe she was an angel
But she?s in disguise
And I just didn?t see the God-light in her eyes
Or maybe I should I walk away
And cut all the ties
Stay on the rise
Leave love left where love dies
We were youngsters
But we?re older now
But the world is a little more colder now
And I?m just trying to get it all off my shoulder now
Baby, you can hold it down
I?ll see you in the wind

Everyone?s got stories gone
About a love we once knew
So high in the beginning
Until the world cuts through
And then everything changes
Nothing feels the same
Piece by piece it falls apart until
All that?s left is blame

That?s right, baby
Next life time
Yeah, ain?t that what they say?
Check it out
Love don?t hate
I got love for you

You can lock your door from the thief, never the liar
I got a firm belief, fight fire with fire
When there's one too many chiefs, all the indians conspire
And somebody gotta go so I can take it higher
Cause I'm a live wire, underneath the radar
State of the art parts, Darth Black Vader
Quicker than a shotgun blast on the trader
Baddest motherfucker both sides the equator
Ready and available, heavily equipped
Steadily my boat rock, but it never flip
I'm heavy hand on the plan tryin to get a grip
Permanent underdog, it's all in the script
My bars went way up, ego went through the roof
I swallowed the truth right along with my pride
I died and came back again, buildin up my stack again
When the world tries to back you in, then you've gots to ride
Lone vigilante, bounty hunter nomad
Boba Fett, no regrets, everything load-ed
My mind is the only thing heavy when I tote it
The one to go down with the last bridge and you know that
Head barely on straight, my heart's in the right place
Still workin on my masterpiece, plannin for the great escape
Get a load of me, look at how I'm takin shape
And I'm so far ahead of the game, make no mistake
Last of the Mohicans, a reverand deacon
Minister Maximillion speakin, heat seakin
I'd rather leave your mind open than to leave it leakin
Aceyalone-wolf, forever and a weekend
The Goddess said she loved me, angels said they had my back
How the hell could I lose, I accept my fate and that was that
Jumped off a moving train to do my thang on the track
Stopped in the heat of the moment, for the impact

Aceyalone,"[Aceyalone]
Didn't you tell me it was all about you
To love respect you is all I gotta do
Disconnect you is somethin that I never thought
How can we learn, from a lesson that was never taught
Man I had so many plans for us
I was hopin that you could save the last dance for us
I never ever leave you in the sandy dust
But trust me, baby I'm the man to trust
I won't call you up, I won't act a fool
Or bring drama to your party, baby that ain't cool
Everyone knows if you snooze you lose
I'm just tryin to figure out if you heard the news
Livin your life is at an all-time high
Don't know why but I think I want that
It ain't cracked up to what it's 'posed to be
And I can love you to death but I'll never come back

[Chorus]
I can love you to death but I'll never come back
I'll never come back, I'll never come back
I can love you to death but I'll never come back
To see how love was, and how it does us
I can love you to death but I'll never come back
Never come back, I'ma never come back
I'ma love you to death but I'll never come back

[Aceyalone]
What do I gotta do to let you know
It's harder and harder for me to just let go
I'd rather be lonely than just live low
Pullin somebody's strings, I don't think so
What do I look like, caught up in some feud
Hoe if you wanna build I got brain food
Know I'll do anything to get you in the mood
But sellin myself sho't, I ain't that dude
Wonder what it'd cost to buy your dreams
Open you up so you could try new things
They call me the candy man, but you ice cream
Speadin my love girl, you're under my wings
One of these days I'ma just go home
And follow that flow to the end of the track
World ain't free as it's supposed to be
And I can love you to death but I'll never come back

[Chorus]

[Aceyalone]
Ain't it funny all the games they play
Give you the green light, and take it all away
Show me a good sign, I'll show you a star
Show me who you love, I'll show you who you are
How many thin lines do we gotta cross
To find our way back or take it as a loss
All that glitter and gloss won't even cost
So how you gonna tell me how to do it when you're not the boss
Who is the real you you don't even claim
The person inside me, that ain't near been the same
Farmer will come, but she won't say her name
Comin to rescue us fears from the pain
One of these things that I got in my head
You made yo' bed, so lay where it's at
I wish I had more than all of me to give
And I can love you to death but I'll never come back

[Final Chorus]
I can love you to death but I'll never come back
I'll never come back, I said I'll never come back
I can love you to death but I'll never come back
To see how love was, and how it does us
I can love you to death but I'll never come back
I'll never come back, I said I'll never come back~!

Aceyalone,"A Beautiful mind, turned water into wine
But that's not all
Broke the water, shined through
Shaped the earth, created the colder life
Radiated with energy, the great boat of life
The spark
Sparkling through the dark night
Then walked
And took forever without a thing in sight
Didn't hear a sound to the first ""treat""
""Deaf to the ocean swelled"" washed up a miracle
A Beautiful yours, a beautiful mine

By the grace of fire, out sprouts the land
And did desire, footprints in the sand
On top of the mountain peak where the man speaks to himself
Cursing to them with a start
What he felt can't be described
It's alive
Rise with the tide
Communicate with all sides, nothing wants to die
Buildin' this, build a bridge
Build a tower
Construct a dam, nigga, ho
Build a flower
Ultraviolet rays magnified the essence
All praise to the presence, one pure thought
Taught him the lessons
This spread with the first migration of the heads
The first wants to flock

A beautiful yours, a beautiful mine
One's so enlightened; one's so divine
The planet's hour line, all devoid of time
A beautiful mind

They opened up the brain and opened up the heart
What is man made of
Love from the dark
The will to invent the will
Work the field, the shield, the intent to kill, the uphill
Matter of existence, matter of persistence,
Matter of distance to search for the mystics
Finder of lost souls, teacher of apostles, the mind's so colossal
A beautiful mind

A beautiful mind, a beautiful idea
One that was right here, blind to the naked eye, tied to a fear
Once it was nothing and now it is here
A beautiful mind

Not accidental, coincidental, experimental
A beautiful man, though a touch so gentle
A life so simple to spin on the axis to access the temple
A beautiful mind

A beautiful mind, put fruit on the vine
At the same time he made love a crime
Mellowed out the strings of all mankind
Walked along side you when you was left behind
Purified the waters, carved the canyons
Fed the families when it was starved and famine
Drew the blueprints so everyone had a chance
Organized the people and made man advance
A beautiful yours, a beautiful mine

Something outa nothing
Oh, what a far cry
More than a hard tribe
Pointed out the start guide
Made love, made hate
Saved sake
Nothing left the crate but fate
Constructed structures, ? a labyrinth
Detailed a portrait
Healed nations
Took blame when no one else was happening
Evolved the species, and had patience
Wrote the scroll in thousands of languages
Came with us to fight against a giant ?
Created chaos, pervaded destruction
Made law and order and then corruption
Laid the foundation for all things to stand on
Then cleared the ground for the mother ship to land on

Sailed across the seas, followed the breeze
Cured disease
Made poison
Settled the fear, took them on the righteous path,
Gave them the math, and still had the time to laugh

Aceyalone,"Yeah.
Yo, what up?
This is Aceyalone.
What's happening?
Yo. 
Let me tell you a story real quick about one of my partners,
About this cat I know. 
One of my homeboys, and we just gonna call him Junior.
Yeah, Junior got some money just for being a good kid.
He sealed it up and never even opened up the lid.
Girls gave him candy cause he treated him nice.
He took it home and chopped it up, and doubled up the price.
Miss Thomas at the parent's conference said we honest.
She was astonished at his confidence and what he accomplished.
He respected his elders, but he knew who he liked.
He listened before he talked, and he never would fight.
It's like, everybody knew him or they wanted to know him,
And anytime they did something for him, they felt that they owed him.
He was learning a life game that no one would show him.
He had more than an idea of where he was going.
He grew into a young man and gained some trust,
And he had a knack for pleasing people, and that was a plus.
Any situation he was in, he would adjust.
He never cussed, and he never fussed what he discussed.

Yeah, that's what I'm talking about.
We was the same age, but I still looked up to him because we had this thing together.
Some people just got that knack, and you can't do nothing about it.
But they end up being a victim of circumstance because he's on the rise and, you know, he's gotta battle against the odds,
And my man had such a good demeanor. 
He was smart, man. 
And he was a hustler.
And he had his ? up. 
And he had a natural ability to bring people together,
And which people he brought together.

By the time he turned 26, he was a...
He was becoming a young prince with a whole lot of sense.
Not only could he make money hustling white,
He had a little bit of everything to get you some height.
They made cash with him so nobody wanted to hit him,
But they'd get him if they had to get him, get rid of him quick.
But why kill off the goose if you're making grip,
And why kill off the captain if you run a good ship?
Some people are strong,
Some people are weak.
Other are smart, but still don't got a stomach for the streets.
But Junior had a different angle, he was an angel. 
The Calypso changed, though ?
The game could tango.
'Cause he can't tango.
A dance with wolves or waltz with a rattlesnake,
What would it prove?
They started salting ? up his program, hoping he'd lose.
But he stayed cool, and he stayed steady, making moves.

Yeah, okay. 
Meanwhile, Junior's off doing his thing, and living up to his full potential,
But the haters, and I don't even want to call them that cause they're worse than that,
But he's become a victim of the monster. 
You know, the machine, the revolving door.
It's them that got versus them that can't get, and ain't gonna never get.

Junior had it good.

Man, four years later, Junior got him a nice stack.
Compared to what he used to have, now he's got twice that.
When beef is at his door, he decided to ice that.
Now knowing more and more, he was caught in a mice trap.
He wanted to fight back.
But who could he tell?
The lesser of the two evils would just put him in a cell.
Everybody around knew that Junior was frail,
But he didn't need muscles to make it, all he needed was a scale.
A hundred and twenty-thousand in cold hard cash,
A stash at gun blast that don't even ask.
You get beat by the only one thing that can beat you,
Defeat you, cheat you, the streets will eat you.
Jealousy and envy make a person deceitful,
Then you add greed to it,
Combonation is lethal.

Well it's a short life knowing that it won't be a sequel.
Sometimes bad things just happen to good people.

Yeah. So they killed him. 
They murdered him in cold blood.
He died face-down in front of an empty safe.
And for the fools that did this, I hope you rot in hell.
I hope you live in hell.
For my nigga, Junior.
Rest in peace.

Junior had it good.",Junior,2006
Aceyalone,"A bunch of wild boys was hanging around
At the local neighborhood saloon
And some cat kept dropping quarters down in the jukebox
Playing all the favorite tunes

And back by the bar playing cards looking hard
Was big bad Solomon Jones
And watching over his luck
Was the love of his life
Is the lady that was known as Simone

When out of the night which was dark and cold
Into the smoke-filled dimly-lit room
Stumbled in a thug
Who was smelling like bud
And his eyes looked high as the moon

He looked like a man with his foot in the grave
And his lifetime about to be out
Yet he slapped down some hundred-dollar bills on the bar
And he yelled out ""drinks on the house""

Now nobody could place where this dude was from
But we knew that he was far from home
But we drank to his health
And the last to drink was big bad Solomon Jones

Now there are some G's
Who just run the streets
And they live life in and out of jail
And such was he, that kind of OG
That looked like he'd been through hell

With his hair in cornrows
A mean mug grill
Like a dog who's day is done
He lit up the green stuff in his cigar
And took hits one by one

Now I got to thinking who this cat could be
And what the hell is- going on
Well I turned around and who was staring at him
The lady that was known as Simone

And the white t-shirt all stained with dirt
He was trying not to be rude
But he was trying to find another
Good song on the jukebox
So he could just set the mood

Have you ever been out in the city streets
With the gang-made players so clear
Where the police and gangsters control the block
And gunshots is all that you hear

When the only sounds are the drums of war
And you left out in the cold
A half-dead man in a half-dead world
And a yellow-brick road to go

Then all of a sudden the music changed
And everyone just held their post â?¨But it felt like a life had been robbed from you
And everything that you held close
Â?¨That someone has stolen the women you love
And that her love was a devil's lie â?¨That your heart was gone and the best thing that you could do is crawl away and die â?¨It's the painful cry of a man's despair deep down in his bones â?¨I guess misery enjoys company, said big bad Solomon Jones

And the stranger turned
And his eyes had burned
In a most peculiar way
And the white t-shirt that was stained in dirt
He sat in to watch me sway

Then his mouth had frowned up in this kind of grin
And he spoke in a voice so clear
""Boys you don't know who I am
And I know that you just don't care""

""Now I'ma say these words
'cause these words are true
And when I'm done here I'll be gone
But one of you boys is a shiesty dog
And his name is Solomon Jones""

Then I ducked my head
And the lights went out
And two guns blazed in the dark
Then I women swooned
And the lights came on
And the two men laced with the starch.

With a bullet in his head
And pumped full of lead
Was big bad Solomon Jones

What a thug from the street
Who was hoeing his heat
And who knows to that lady named Simone

Baby I'm your star, but you looking for a super hero
And Superman don't fly no more cause he ain't one with the people
He ain't nowhere to be found, when he should be fighting evil

You make me whole It's not the movies, but it fake the role
I try to take control for the sake of soul
But the only thing I get to do is scrape the bowl
When God made me, said â??break the moldâ??
I put foot to the concrete and shake the road
I don't have powers like a caped crusader
But I do have powers like an Ace invader
Back in the days he had so much flavor
He was so major to get you out of danger
Now you can't find him, and he's just a stranger
And if you did he'd probably give you the finger
Your hit channel's evil on your channel changer
And your hero with a lifesaver threw you an anchor

I really don't know what you thinking of
I can't make it wet from underneath my glove
I can't see through walls but I can see through you
You dress up the ball but that's all you do
You fell for him, he didn't fall for you
And just me is what I got to offer you
I don't save the day, I just pave the way
In the city of Gotham where every day's a day
I know it pays to play, but I ain't playing
I ain't laying my coat down; know what I'm saying?
You want lots of muscles and lots of green
But my hustle and bustle is my only thing
It ended all bad as my last song seems
You need a star in your life and not in your dreams

But that's not all
Broke the water, shined through
Shaped the earth, created the colder life
Radiated with energy, the great boat of life
The spark
Sparkling through the dark night
Then walked
And took forever without a thing in sight
Didn't hear a sound to the first ""treat""
""Deaf to the ocean swelled"" washed up a miracle
A Beautiful yours, a beautiful mine

By the grace of fire, out sprouts the land
And did desire, footprints in the sand
On top of the mountain peak where the man speaks to himself
Cursing to them with a start
What he felt can't be described

Rise with the tide
Communicate with all sides, nothing wants to die

Build a tower
Construct a dam, nigga, ho

All praise to the presence, one pure thought

The first wants to flock

The planet's hour line, all devoid of time

Love from the dark

Matter of distance to search for the mystics
Finder of lost souls, teacher of apostles, the mind's so colossal

One that was right here, blind to the naked eye, tied to a fear
Once it was nothing and now it is here
A beautiful mind

Not accidental, coincidental, experimental
A beautiful man, though a touch so gentle
A life so simple to spin on the axis to access the temple
A beautiful mind

A beautiful mind, put fruit on the vine
At the same time he made love a crime
Mellowed out the strings of all mankind
Walked along side you when you was left behind
Purified the waters, carved the canyons
Fed the families when it was starved and famine
Drew the blueprints so everyone had a chance
Organized the people and made man advance
A beautiful yours, a beautiful mine

Something outa nothing
Oh, what a far cry
More than a hard tribe
Pointed out the start guide
Made love, made hate
Saved sake
Nothing left the crate but fate
Constructed structures, ? a labyrinth
Detailed a portrait
Healed nations
Took blame when no one else was happening
Evolved the species, and had patience
Wrote the scroll in thousands of languages
Came with us to fight against a giant ?
Created chaos, pervaded destruction
Made law and order and then corruption
Laid the foundation for all things to stand on
Then cleared the ground for the mother ship to land on

Sailed across the seas, followed the breeze
Cured disease
Made poison
Settled the fear, took them on the righteous path,
Gave them the math, and still had the time to laugh

In den Wind gespuckt

War es himmlische Ruh
Und die Sonne stand senkrecht am Himmel
Als ich über die Reeling sah
Da glaubte ich zu träumen
Da waren tausend Boote

In den Booten waren Männer und Frauen

Acid Drinkers,"We all came out to Montreux
On the Lake Geneva shoreline
To make records with a mobile
We didn't have much time
Frank Zappa and the Mothers
Were at the best place around
But some stupid with a flare gun
Burned the place to the ground
Smoke on the water, fire in the sky

They burned down the gambling house
It died with an awful sound
Funky Claude was running in and out
Pulling kids out the ground
When it all was over
We had to find another place
But Swiss time was running out
It seemed that we would lose the race
Smoke on the water, fire in the sky

We ended up at the Grand Hotel
It was empty cold and bare
But with the Rolling truck Stones thing just outside
Making our music there
With a few red lights and a few old beds
We make a place to sweat
No matter what we get out of this
I know we'll never forget

Come run the hidden pine trails of the forest
Come taste the sun-sweet berries of the earth
Come roll in all the riches all around you

The heron and the otter are my friends

Acie Cargill,"If you'll gather 'round me, children
A story I will tell
'Bout Pretty Boy Floyd, an outlaw
Oklahoma knew him well

It was in the town of Shawnee
A Saturday afternoon
His wife beside him in his wagon
As into town they rode

There a deputy sheriff approached him
In a manner rather rude
Vulgar words of anger
An' his wife she overheard

Pretty Boy grabbed a log chain
And the deputy grabbed his gun
In the fight that followed
He laid that deputy down

Then he took to the trees and timber
To live a life of shame
Every crime in Oklahoma
Was added to his name

But a many a starving farmer
The same old story told
How the outlaw paid their mortgage
And saved their little homes

Others tell you 'bout a stranger
That come to beg a meal
Underneath his napkin
Left a thousand dollar bill

It was in Oklahoma City
It was on a Christmas Day
There was a whole car load of groceries
Come with a note to say

Well, you say that I'm an outlaw
You say that I'm a thief
Here's a Christmas dinner
For the families on relief

Yes, as through this world I've wandered
I've seen lots of funny men
Some will rob you with a six-gun
And some with a fountain pen

And as through your life you travel
Yes, as through your life you roam
You won't never see an outlaw
Drive a family from their home",Pretty Boy Floyd,2007

Is the sound of distant drumming just the fingers of your hand?
Pictures hanging in a hallway and the fragment of a song
Half remembered names and faces, but to whom do they belong?

That the autumn leaves were turning to the color of her hair!

I've lived a life that's full.
I've traveled each and evry highway;

Each careful step along the byway, 
But more, much more than this, 
I did it my way.

Yes, there were times, I'm sure you knew
When I bit off more than I could chew.

But through it all, when there was doubt, 
I ate it up and spit it out.
I faced it all and I stood tall; 
And did it my way.

I've had my fill; my share of losing.
And now, as tears subside, 
I find it all so amusing.

And may I say - not in a shy way, 
No, oh no not me, 
I did it my way.

Though not a word was spoken

One look, and I forgot the gloom of the past
One look and I had found my future at last
One look and I had found a world completely new
When love walked in with you

Acker Bilk,"They say, Ruby you're like a  dream
Not always what you seem
And though my heart may break when I awake
Let it be so
I only know, Ruby, it's you
 
They say, Ruby you're like a song
You don't know right from wrong
And in your eyes I see heart aches for me
But from the start, who stole my heart?
Ruby, it's you
I hear your voice and I must come to you
I have no choice what else can I do? 
 
They say, Ruby you're like a flame
Into my life you came 
And though I should beware
Still I don't care you thrill me so

Acker Bilk,"And now the purple dusk of twilight time
Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb
Always reminding me that we're apart
You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms
The nightingale 
Tells his fairytale
Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain
My stardust melody
The memory of love's refrain.",Stardust,1991
Acker Bilk,"Oh! Will you never let me be?
Oh! Will you never set me free?
The ties that bound us
Are still around us
There's no escape that I can see
And still those little things remain
That bring me happiness or pain

A cigarette that bears a lipstick's traces
An airline ticket to romantic places
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
A tinkling piano in the next apartment
Those stumbling words that told you what my heart meant
A fair ground's painted swings
These foolish things remind me of you
You came you saw you conquer'd me
When you did that to me
I knew somehow this had to be
The winds of March that make my heart a dancer
A telephone that rings but who's to answer?
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

First daffodils and long excited cables
And candle lights on little corner tables
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
The park at evening when the bell has sounded
The ""Ile de France"" with all the gulls around it
The beauty that is Spring's
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The sigh of midnight trains in empty stations
Silk stockings thrown aside dance invitations
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

Gardenia perfume ling'ring on a pillow
Wild strawb'ries only seven francs a kilo
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
The smile of Garbo and the scent of roses
The waiters whistling as the last bar closes
The song that Crosby sings
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The scent of smould'ring leaves, the wail of steamers
Two lovers on the street who walk like dreamers
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you",These Foolish Things,1991

When I try to explain how I feel
That I still need your love after all that I've done
You won't believe me, all you will see is a girl you once knew
Although she's dressed up to the nines
At sixes and sevens with you
I had to let it happen, I had to change

And so I face the final curtain
My friend, I'll say it clear
I'll state my case, of which I'm certain

I've lived a life that's full
I've traveled each and every highway
Oh, and more, much more than this
I did it my way

Regrets, I've had a few
But then again, too few to mention
I did what I had to do
And saw it through without exemption

I planned each charted course
Each careful step along the byway
But more, much more than this
I did it my way

Yes, there were times, I'm sure you knew
When I bit off more than I could chew
But through it all, when there was doubt
I ate it up and spit it out
I faced it all and I stood tall
And did it my way

I've loved, I've laughed and cried
Had my fill, my share of losing
And now, as tears subside
I find it all so amusing

To think I did all that
And may I say, not in a shy way
""Oh no, oh no not me
I did it my way""

For what is a man, what has he got?
If not himself, then he has naught
To say the things he truly feels

For time has now decided that we must go our individual ways
The warmth I feel inside can more than overcome my loss
But this is me today and tomorrow I must count the cost

We'll meet again sometime
Though the road is steep and very hard to climb

The pleasures of a lifetime condensed into a fleeting glimpse of truth
A moment of delight as when a child receives a sixpence for a tooth
The simple things in life mean more to me than money ever buys
The greatest thing for me to see my love reflected in your eyes

We'll meet again sometime
Though the road is steep and very hard to climb

We'll meet again sometime
Though the way is never clear
My sacrifice is made
Everything that I hold dear

We'll meet again sometime
Though the road is steep and very hard to climb

Oh, lover of a lifetime, let me look upon your loveliness alone
Oh, but I cannot gaze too long for I fear that it will turn me into stone
A monument to life to stand forever by your grave
Inscribed for all to see, a message of respect, ""Be brave""

She woke from a start from a dream of stars
Let's talk about metaphysics she sighed in her bvd's
She didn't need comfort just some verbal intercourse
A dance around the intelligence tree

Where was the light before it came here?
Who held the power to begin the spin?
What is in store? what am I here for?
Is it love? is it war? is there more?

There she stands at my mind again
The age of poetry had begun

Wasn't that a time for love?
Wasn't that a time for imagination?
Wasn't that a time for the light?
Go out and stuff the universe into your eyes

Out together on the streets
At the barricades or in the sheets
What a scintillating bitch with her eyes on the light
""let's go to hell together"" in her eyes

Why do we remember the past and not the future?
What's inside a black hole? what is the nature of the universe?
How does it work? which way is west in space?
Is there sex in heaven? is it the best?

Connect me with my intellect, she lied
You can't hide the sexual drive

Friction makes sparks, sparks make fire
Fire makes heat and the heat will endure 'til the
Animal comes with a ferocity not unlike

A lover's ear can hear the lowest sound
A lover's lip taste like the dream
I know you like it on top don't stop

Wasn't that a time for the light?
Wasn't that a time for bright ideas?
Wasn't that a time for love and danger?
Go out and stuff the universe into your eyes

The only answer that I have found
Above the sky or below the ground
Is that there are no answers
There never were any answers
There will never be any answers
And as Gertrude Stein said, ""that's the answer""

I'm not afraid of the future
I'm not afraid of ideas
I'm not afraid to shake the foundation

These are visions of tomorrow
These are visions of the strength of ideas
Like matter and energy, ideas shape the sky
Of the future years

In my world, love is true
In my world, teachers get paid more than baseball players
In my world, there is you, but
In the real world, people get hungry
In the real world, people need love
In the real world, people need food and light and ideas and hope and love and a soothing human touch

Standing in the presence of god
Standing in the halls of imagination
Every boy a lion, every girl a tiger

I got thin, I got thin, while the others got fat
So fatten up and deliver your secrets
Those secrets, those stories untold

Sorry to say love is a game
We're all just pawns in the way
Lost, lost, lost, move the rook-E-eight
Eliminate and get this game underway

Too many secrets are shattering our lives
While others are stuck in expansive time
I've been trying to get out of this
Goddamn fucking game

So back it up and up to down
Down, downtown, don't you tell me wrong
Choose your battle of words that rule the world
It's in our heads anyway

Speak of the devil and I just may appear
I appeared in your dream, when you dreamed of getting ahead
Headless chickens that are missing their exes
So axe this and go to the next, next chapter

Too many secrets are shattering our lives
While others are stuck in expansive time

[Incomprehensible]

Which shall I be, a warlock or a priest
A pagan, Christian or an evangelist?
Pledge my alliance in the name of science
Follow the moth into the fire
Getting my head in a bit of a twist
What does it matter when your enemies are my friends?

Self serve friends, who are friends for a second
I second that notation, it feels so intense?
Intensely fishing without a hook, line, and sinker
I sank to bottom, we'll bottoms up to you

Please inject some instant karma
Into my instant coffee
Soon, soon, soon with the rope in the kitchen
All the answers will be on there way

Too many secrets are shattering our lives
While others are stuck in expansive time

Yo, get the whip, get the whip!

I'll take 21st Century poets that's for a thousand
Curly hair or Nubian women get me aroused
To the point I wanna gamble it all
I was smashing from the back
She put her hands on the wall
She couldn't take the thrust
Only lust like a fiend for the dust
Or the pizza from Pezzi, perfect
Want to sleep with the crust
Or the 740 Alpina, leather seats is a must
And my shorty holding a nina
Rolling green in a dutch!

In the purest form, lyrically derived from nature
Like the Amazon, put your cameras on
