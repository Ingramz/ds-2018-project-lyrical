Krumbsnatcha,"Stupid, you know it's time to sit and think, before we hit the brink
Locked room, at a prize fight, before he hit the ring
Like when I tell these corporate leeches they can't get a thing
Or when I tell relentless rappers they had better sing
The position that anyone holds could be up to grabs
I'm waitin' up the ave to see if anyone folds
Since I was twenty-one years old and legal
I knew the difference between gimmicky gangsters and powerful people

I'm the reason, why the game is flipped
I'm the reason, why your aim is missed
I'm the reason why you're mad I only sprained my wrist
The reason my mind frame is trained in this
You like gunfire? Better acquire the taste
'Cause you walk around with full pounds by them waist
Deface property, they be laced properly
Rules are rules, fools are fools, I react logically
Ain't no way, so come, make my day
Like Tom Hanks I earn long bank and Cast you Away 

""This mic in my hand, I'm rulin'""
""I repeat, this is not a question""

Oh you brag about the keys you flipped and who you done up
Nigga what up? (Put up or shut up)
Poppin' shit about the chicks and the whips you got
You think you hot? (Uh-uh, man you put up or shut up)
Always talkin' bout your dough and your wealth and fame
You's a lame (Get out of here, put up or shut up)
You got hot beats and kids that can spit mad fire?
You's a liar! (That's whack, put up or shut up)

Ask ya self, is you ready for action?
Ask ya self, is you ready for action?
Ask ya self, is you ready for action?
Ask ya self, is you ready for the hardcore?

Ask ya self if you ready for drama
With two of the baddest motherfuckers ever to create, tunes to a lama
You fucking with the best
(First, ask ya self if you ready for Krumb Snatch)
Then ask you self if you ready for Tef

And if you ready for death, pull all the steps out
I'ma make the glocks sound
(Nigga we got it locked out)
(Y'all niggas is popped out)
We're raw 'n diggy Caveliti
(All city)
(And this here, what we call gritty)

I'm one of the five Horsemen, gimme twenty four hours to live
And I'll swell with a baked beans outta Boston
Proceed with caution, I'm about to wig out
To the skit, on the D&D-project, blew the shit out

By accident, we do some shit on the mic
That a kid is convicted in Interstate, trapped again
Fuck, y'all talking 'bout after we kick a hole
In the speaker then pull the plug, we walking out

Ask ya self, is you ready for action?
Ask ya self, is you ready for action?
Ask ya self, is you ready for action?
Ask ya self, is you ready for the hardcore?
The hardcore

Now ask ya self, do you can keep run faster
Than this bullet can chamber?
(Son, you in danger)
We hit off heavy metal to settle to be frequently
And that's all me
(Nigga)

Thinking you can talk sideways from the sound woofer
No prove of action
(My whole team laughing)
And ask ya self, do you think we got the time
For you tucking-truck rhymes?
(Bitch, hell no)

We put wigs on fire like Michael mean Pepsi
(Cats blowing like a lesbie)
Testing me and Tef is like me and you laugh
And we'll announce a breath from holy you nnothing
That's def

Listen, nigga, we don't doubt you
Simply we don't give a fuck about you
Me and my girlfriend, I make the world spin without you
You fucking with real niggaz, feel niggaz
Walking through the house and kill niggaz
(Hardcore)
Bitch, nigga

Ask ya self, is you ready for action?

Don't hold me back Tef
Na, na, lemme go, lemme go
Fuck these niggaz
Naw, they don't know, hold up dog
Lemme go, hold up dog, hold up

Na, na, na, hold up, wait up, they went about it wrong
Feelin' brave hearted, try me on a song
I'm a let niggaz know, they got it confused
You got gats and bats we get those too

Semi's and macks cocked and aimed at you
Bloodthirsty, star what the worst be
No mercy, we god and bang hard with any squad or mobb
Coming forty niggaz like a jail yard

Blood on my silk shirt, choke niggaz out
Scuffed up my Timbs, we bang 'em in the mouth
You niggaz want a concrete rebel
Pulling out busting like war in the jungle

Mad 'cause my crew lay bubble in the tunnel
Most humble, we send shots when we come through
Get praised but still blaze in the battle
The ruff days, these two bullets niggaz tattle

I'm immune to them tuff-talk, them big boy stanze
You coming in pairs, then two bodies by the stairs
Nigga we bang with the best, the models to rest
Create drama, rock armor, Smith & Wess-ons

Blood shot, gun cocked, mingling shotting
Lost in this world I'm in, feeling money rhyming
Eyes roaming, zoning, looking with a Nottz beat
Label most dangerous, police lay and watch me

Harts start jumping, we peeping niggaz fronting
We come through thumping, pulling out dumping
Tangle with your best entourage

We coming in yards to face off with any yards
Soldier you're dust on the fully loaded shotgun
Whistling throughout the air, just to mock one
Blood for your socks son

Is you ready for the hardcore
The hardcore
And after Krumb Snatcha snatch yo' worthy possessions
I got strict orders to clap you

Tha onez in the club now dictate, niggas

This is going out to my homies with Dr. Dre
Why do you think that Sam is gay?
Does he stare at your arse all day?
Isn't that gonna be the 2nd month in a row in May?

Blaze, niggas, let's behave, niggas
Tha onez in the club now dictate, niggas

So you think you can take my life?
Think you can take my wife?
Well, I'll like to see you try when I've got my knife

I'll stab you in the back
Run to your house, then give your mum a slap
Don't fuck with me
Otherwise 6 feet under is where you're gonna be

[Verse 1: XL]
We're from the be	 to the O-S-T-O-N
Where cats double push friends for dollars and gems
Platinum artistes they don't want to come here (nah)
Not cause of lack of money or bitches, but out of fear
Rappers up here be gettin' overlooked for years
Started hatin' on eachother sabotagin' careers
Ten o' the best MC's we got to offer
To shut down you cock blockin' shit talkers

[Verse 2: Ed O.G.]
Mad niggaz think they flossin' in rap
But no one knew Boston could rap
Till Edo put this shit on the map
Now the change is drastic, Hip-Hop got Jurassic
And none of you Boston bastards made a classic
Got the right voice, make the right noise
Can't stand none of you niggaz and none of you white boys
My men's is down to take the city, hands down
From the ropes to Pakis all the way to Landsdown

[Verse 3: Big Juan]
How you gon' lie about the place that you're from?
The house you grow up in, the block that you hung
Politics ain't my fortay
You gettin' fucked without the foreplay
Heaven trouble comin' through the doorway
G ain't playin' you dubs in the clubs
And heads ain't showin' you no love in the Hub
Spend time on the road, hotel's all alone
Not for Hillstreet times ain't no place like home

[Chorus: x 4 Guru]
I'ma get home, I'ma get there
Make it back even if I'm caught outthere

[Verse 4: JaySon]
When I think of the Bean I think of the artist who
Got fucked over by Maurice Starr and Larry Wu
I think I-L-be	, fifteen years of are & be	 transmitted outside Dudley
Plus the Bumrush specially celebrities
Aks Kane, Moe Dee, Mo Vaughn and Eric B.
Murdapan, Deathchester and Glocksbury

It's the chin checkin', Chuck chokin' predator
Boston rap (Big Shug) Murdapan settler (huh)
I'm bettin' the stakes be high, when you die
Diss the crew, and lose the sight in you eyes
We multiply to bring the real on the track
Cross the line and there ain't no goin' back (fuckin' fag)
In fact, these niggas will rip ya ass apart
Bury that head in Franklin and your body in Hyde Park

Represent Boston like Arabs and Israelis
Police tail me, backstabbers try to nail me
DJ's play me at the clubs past eleven
On 88.9, 94.5 and Hot97
Beantown's a cold city Dorchester gritty
Murdered over a fifty, hometown ain't it shifted
I travel the map but I always come back
To burn it down behind 24 tracks

[Verse 7: Krumb Snatcha]
Shoot outs fit niggas get twist in the Bean
Below the exploded magazine leave my head on the scene
Long time to Glocksbury twist your nine on the spot
Either you out to get this paper, or you work for the cops
My don stylo finally ya niggaz know how it go
Most hated at the back with the gats at the show
Quick to die with the stripes on squeezing like a python
Half the industry ya already dead before the mic's on

[Verse 8: Akrobatik]
My rapstyle's changed like Rodman's head
It's Akrobatik representin' Common Square (Hell yeah)
Where you can hop on the Red Line
And catch me at the Middle East
Wippin' hoes close to headline
The winter's east Stone Cold like Steve Austin
But I promise my heart will never leave Boston
And that's the bottom line cause Akro say so

Get shot up by them heats

y'all don't want, beef
No y'all don't want, that
Get caught up in these streets
Get shot up by them heats

Word to my cousin, the truth and no lie
Me and my dawg was in his brand new Land, puffin' on lye
Tameka came by, glossy-eyed as she cried
Lil' Jay got sprayed with a chrome four-five

That's my motherfuckin' man, get in the Land
Head to the rest, grab vests, switch whips to the Caravan
I heard an ambulance right up the block
Plus more shots, the shit's gettin' hot, pull up and park

By the back, pass the gat, hit the lights and lay back
Hold up, now roll up, yo where them niggaz at?
I know one of them cats from the projects with Jay
The first nigga move, I'ma pull this gun, spray

No delay, we stay night to fuckin' dawn
It's on, my head spinnin', feelin' my cheeks get warm
Tears drip as I stepped out the whip
Slipped a clip, had to get hit, uh-uh that's that bullshit

y'all don't want beef
No y'all don't want that
Get caught up in these streets
Get shot up by them heats

y'all don't want beef
No y'all don't want that
Get caught up in these streets
Get shot up by them heats

Yo, I can't believe my man since 3rd grade got sprayed
Bullet laced as he laid, chokin' up blood with no aid
Made money for the purpose of his daughter
Victim of an unmerciful slaughter, explain harder

Or don't bother, I'ma heat yo' ass like lava
Identified was that tinted gray Chevy Impala
Fleein' the scene, as the back tires screamed
Now for them my man [Incomprehensible], ruined his whole dream

Of playin' ball pro, bitch that's how it go
You let me know, I'll hit your whole fuckin' team with the metal
Mental struggle got my hand under the bubble
Tryin' to blow steam and leave the scene blood puddles

Snakes, whattup nigga? These niggaz ain't explainin'
Well, fuck it then, it's time for some gestratin'
Hit him in the worthless shell he came in
Murder is a sin, but it's worse him dyin' on revenge and I ain't havin' it

y'all don't want beef
No y'all don't want that
Get caught up in these streets
Get shot up by them heats

y'all don't want beef
No y'all don't want that
Get caught up in these streets
Get shot up by them heats

I ain't havin' it, reached in the bubble and grabbed it
Automatic cocked back and squeezed through his Polo fabric
Nigga duckin' and runnin', irrationally gunnin'
Thinkin' to myself, do I gotta hit someone

Then I heard shots from a back route
Fired back out, got shot, dropped and blacked out
Put in a clap out, didn't map out or act out the plans
Now I'm consciously layin' while bullets is sprayin' the Caravan

We can't lose, I hear shotguns then 22's
Left arm booze, or blood soaked through my Adidas shoes
Heavy breathin', a lot of bleedin'
Bitches screamin', put over on my good shoulder, started squeezin'

Out the back window, she gave the wrong info
Suddenly crashed into a Pinto
Hopped out, flew through the back yard, word to God
It's on and I felt the gat slip through my palm

Kept runnin', hopped the fence, hopin' that I didn't leave prints
Spotted a black Ac' parked with dark tints
Broke the passenger's side, hotwired the wide and slide
Another unsolved homicide

y'all don't want beef
No y'all don't want that
Get caught up in these streets
Get shot up by them heats

y'all don't want beef

Whereas, breakbeats have been the missing link connecting the diasporic
community to its drum woven past
 Whereas  the quantised drum has allowed the whirling mathematicians to
calculate the ever changing distance between rock and stardom.
Whereas the velocity of the spinning vinyl, cross-faded, spun backwards, and
re-released at the same given moment of recorded history , yet at a
different moment in time's continuum has allowed history to catch up with
the present.

We do hereby declare reality unkempt by the changing standards of dialogue.
Statements, such as, ""keep it real"", especially when punctuating or
anticipating modes of ultra-violence inflicted psychologically or physically
or depicting an unchanging rule of events will hence forth be seen as
retro-active and not representative of the individually determined is.

Furthermore, as determined by the collective consciousness of this state of
being and the lessened distance between thought patterns and their secular
manifestations, the role of men as listening receptacles is to be increased
by a number no less than 70 percent of the current enlisted as vocal
aggressors.

Motherfuckers better realize, now is the time to self-actualize
We have found evidence that hip hops standard 85 rpm when increased by a
number as least half the rate of it's standard or decreased at ¾ of it's
speed may be a determining factor in heightening consciousness.

Studies show that when a given norm is changed in the face of the
unchanging, the remaining contradictions will parallel the truth.

Equate rhyme with reason, Sun with season

Our cyclical relationship to phenomenon has encouraged scholars to erase the
centers of periods, thus symbolizing the non-linear character of cause and
effect
Reject mediocrity!

Your current frequencies of understanding outweigh that which as been given
for you to understand.
The current standard is the equivalent of an adolescent restricted to the
diet of an infant.
The rapidly changing body would acquire dysfunctional and deformative
symptoms and could not properly mature on a diet of apple sauce and crushed
pears
Light years are interchangeable with years of living in darkness.
The role of darkness is not to be seen as, or equated with, Ignorance, but
with the unknown, and the mysteries of the unseen.

Krysna,"It came upon the midnight clear
That glorious song of old
From Angels playing near the earth
To touch their harps of gold

Peace on the earth could will two men
From Heaven's all-gracious King
The world in solemn stillness lay
To hear the Angels sing

And I hear them singing
Sing, I do hear them singing

The first Noel the Angel did say
Was to certain poor shepherds in fields as they lay
In fields where they lay, they keeping their sheep
On a cold winter's night that was so deep",It Came Upon a Midnight Clear,1999
Krysta Rodriguez,"Once, I was hopeful
Thought we were one.
Life, less than perfect
Finally begun.
But, now I wonder
Are we undone?
I wanna treasure you in death as well as life
I wanna cut you with my love and with my knife
But can I live as your tormentor and your wife
When I am crazier than you
I'm crazier than you
And nothing up til now has proved me wrong
I'm crazier than you
That's just the overview
So get on board or simply move along

I'm not impulsive
(and yet I truly love you)
I'm not deranged
(I'd never ask that of you)
But in this moment
I feel I've changed.
I wanna climb Mt. Everest go to Mozambique
I wanna be impulsive want to be unique
Can you believe I mean it when you hear me shriek
I'm crazier than you
I'm crazier than you
And now I'll prove to you exactly how
I'm crazier than you
I'll do what you can do
From here on in I give my solemn vow

Pluck the arrow from its quiver,
Hold it in your hand be brave.
Pierce the apple not the liver
Or we're dancing on my grave.
Place it in the bow and steady,
Can't you shoot that thing already!
I wanna demonstrate that fear is my ideal
(Girl believe me fear is your ideal)
Cause in the moment that you're frightened life is real
(Then my life must be real real!)
And in a flash when I release and seal the deal

I'm crazier than you
I'm crazier than you
And nothing hurts me when I hear you say
I'm crazier than you
Psychotically into
And that is all I need to face the day
I'm crazier than you
I'm crazier than you
And live or die I'll let you have control
I'm crazier than you
So say you love me too
From here on in you're singing to my soul
My soul!",Crazier Than You,2010
Krysta Rodriguez,"I don't have a sunny disposition.
I'm not known for being too amused.
My demeanor's locked in one position.
See my face? I'm enthused.
Suddenly, however, I've been puzzled.
Bunny rabbits make me want to cry.
All my inhibitions have been muzzled,
And I think I know why.

I'm being pulled in a new direction,
But I think I like it.
I think I like it.
I'm being pulled in a new direction.
Through my painful pursuit,
Somehow birdies took root.
All the things I detested impossibly cute.
God! What do I do?
Pulled

Mother always said be kind to strangers,
But she doesn't know what they destroy.
I can feel the clear and present dangers,
When she learns that the boy

Has got me pulled in a new direction,
But I think I like it.

That was good! That was good!

I think I like it.

Do it again! Do it again!

I'm being pulled in a new direction,
But this feeling, I know is impossible,
So I'll confide that I've tried but I can't let it go.
It's disgustingly true!
Pulled, pulled, pulled!

Puppy dogs with droopy faces,
Unicorns with dancing mice,
Sunrise in wide open spaces,
Disney World, I'll go there twice!
Butterflies and picnic lunches,
Bunches of chrysanthemums,
Lollipops and pillow fights and Christmas eve,
Sugar plums!
String quartets and Chia Pets,
And afternoon banana splits,
Angels watching as I sleep,
And Liberace's Greatest Hits!

Have got me pulled in a new direction!
If they keep insisting, I'll stop resisting.
Just watch me pulled in a new direction.
I should stay in the dark,
Not obey every spark,
But the boy has a bite,
Better far than his bark!
And you bet I'll bite too,
Do what's truly taboo,
As I'm pulled in a new direction!",Pulled,2010
Krysta Youngs,"Don't look so sad
I know it's over
But life goes on
And this old world will keep on turning
Let's just be glad
We had some time to spend together
There's no need to watch the bridges
That were burning

Lay your head upon my pillow
Hold your warm and tender body
Close to mine
Hear the whisper of the rain drops
Blowing soft against the window
And make believe you love me
One more time
For the good times

I'll get along
You'll find another
And I'll be here
If you should find you ever need me
Don't say a word about tomorrow
Or forever
There'll be time enough for sadness
When you leave me

Lay your head upon my pillow

To lose your shadow

And you always took me back
Time and again you were my friend
Show me how to be like that

Your voice whispers in the breeze and You are near

Through everything around me I find comfort in You
Through trials and the heartache Your words, they speak the truth
Lay me down to sleep now, You'll still be on my mind
If I die before I wake, You'd still see through the lines

Pray for me one more time
I can feel You though You're not here
Your voice whispers in the breeze and You are near to me

Yeah, I've been ripped out, cut short
Stopped within my tracks
I've been tied down, turned 'round
Learned to face the facts

I was nothing now something
You're everything to me
Don't go, please stay
You're all that I need

For a trophy
Put it on the shelf

He has what it takes to get what he wants

Tucked behing two friends and a thick group of trees
We fit into this urban view
Tucked below the avenues
Central Park is much more beautiful at night. Green though green changes hue through it's lack of light. We move like shadows down the path. A tripping stone escapes a laugh.

And the traffic and the hard shoes pound a world away.

In these moments of almost silence I can almost swear I'd stay in this city. God help me.

An arm and a leg is what you'll pay to lay your head. I'm a fool behind these walls, but the beauty of it all is I'm here. I'm here.

In this circus amidst these clowns running my hand through the lions mane. These visions of Manhattan through the keyhole of a plane will never compare to just being there.

Krzysztof Komeda,"I want to take you to a little room
A little room where all the roses bloom
I want to lead you into Nature's hall
Where ev'ry year the roses give a ball
They have an orchestra up in the trees
For their musicians are the birds and bees
And they will sing us a song
As we are strolling along
 
In sunny Roseland, where summer breezes are playing
Where the honey bees are ""A-Maying""
There all the roses are swaying
Dancing while the meadow brook flows
The moon when shining is more than ever designing
For 'tis ever then I am pining
Pining to be sweetly reclining
Somewhere in Roseland
Beside a beautiful rose
 
The ball is over and tulips meet
Their little kisses are so short and sweet
The lilies nod to the forget-me-nots
When they're departing in their flower pots
But all the roses with their spirits high
Remain to love until they droop and die
And dear, why shouldn't it be
Just so with you and with me
 
In sunny Roseland, where summer breezes are playing
Where the honey bees are ""A-Maying""
There all the roses are swaying
Dancing while the meadow brook flows
The moon when shining is more than ever designing
For 'tis ever then I am pining
Pining to be sweetly reclining
Somewhere in Roseland
Beside a beautiful rose

Krzysztof Komeda,"I hate to see that evening sun go down
I hate to see that evening sun go down
Cause my baby, he's gone left this town

Feelin' tomorrow like I feel today
If I'm feelin' tomorrow like I feel today
I'll pack my truck and make my give-a-way

St. Louis woman with her diamond ring
Pulls that man around by her, if it wasn't for her and her
That man I love would have gone nowhere, nowhere

I got the St. Louis blues, blues as I can be
That man's got a heart like a rock cast in the sea
Or else he wouldn't have gone so far from me

I love my baby like a school boy loves his pie
Like a Kentucky colonel loves his mint 'n rye
I love my man till the day I die",St. Louis Blues,1998

I've got my old girls down here, chilling on knees
I've got my new girls down here, willing to please
I'm on the next ting, quick thing, wired up, cheque please
Still I’m still a young thing, ain't that something?
Living life like I never thought I could
With my team here around and everything is all good
And then I

Look at myself, I see my face
In blurry visions everyday
Smoke 'n' mirrors
Blind me from the way
Smoke 'n' mirrors
Blind me from the way

I grew up poor, everyday I wore that same dirty Yankee cap
Low over my eyes, I didn't wanna talk to no-one, I was angry fast
Forward to a month ago I was in the New Era office
And they let me take what I like imagine that
I guess things do change, couldn't afford family holidays
Growing up, but today I've been on two planes
Never begged it, why you have to go making a scene
My bars go over heads like Michelangelo painting a ceiling
Life's like a motion picture, we’re blinded by Smoke ‘n’ Mirrors
And lies that were told to give a desire to go and buy
All the things we that can't afford, we're convinced that we need
I just want to be happy and not live in the street
They fucking with my chakra, I'm just tryna do me
You idolizing guys that lie and hide behind their jewelry
Their heart is empty and their soul is hollow
Living like there's no tomorrow, I know every moment's borrowed
Like a walls of sorrow (Smoke 'n' mirrors)

Blind me from the way
Smoke 'n' mirrors
Blind me from the way

I don't wanna get lost on this long road
I've been looking for something hoping it unfolds
But I see a lot of smoke in the air
And I've been looking in the mirror but the reflection is unknown
Am I going mad, losing my mind?
I tell myself I'm doing just fine too many times
But man are dead weight, my boy said, ""Get your head straight""
I'm like ""Brothe', you can say that again""
But I never would've imagined this chain of events
I remember when I just wanted some fame in the ends
Trying to do it all the same as my friends
And it's funny how it switched up, maybe sing your next song
Why we tryna see clear? Looking through the mist, but
I don't wanna be here, when I get a glimpse up

I would do them all the time
To remind me that I could be just like Barbie
Cinderella, settle down
Washing up in glamour gowns
A man who has it all and more
A motor car that I adore
Smiling through the night
A little flash of brilliant white
Reflecting the perfection of the world

Give her sisters, give her brothers
But compared to me and others
She'll always be a motherless girl

Every single day
There's a million parts to play
There isn't any time for being lonely
Going up in aeroplanes
Pulling back on pony reins
Making sure that what she wears
Is looking super like her hair
The emptiness inside
Isn't strong enough to hide
That her features aren't too pretty for her pearls

Give her sisters, give her brothers
But compared to me and others
She'll always be a motherless girl

Although it's heaven to touch her
She's just like a soldier
She loves
And as she sees you grow older
And no longer hold her
She knows

Give her sisters, give her brothers
But compared to me and others
She'll always be a motherless girl
Oh a history of lovers
But compared to me and others
She'll always be a motherless girl

Well, my heart knows me better than I know myself
So I'm gonna let it do all the talking
I came across a place in the middle of nowhere
With a big black horse and a cherry tree

I felt a little fear upon my back
He said, Don't look back, just keep on walking
When the big black horse said, Hey lady
(When the big black horse said, Look this way
Said, Look this way, will you marry me?
(Said, Hey, lady, will you marry me?)

But I said no, no, no, no, no, no
I said no, no, you're not the one for me
No, no, no, no, no, no
I said no, no, you're not the one for me

And my heart hit a problem, in the early hours
So I stopped it dead for a beat or two
But I cut some cord, and I shouldn't have done it
And it won't forgive me after all these years

So I sent it to a place in the middle of nowhere
With a big black horse and a cherry tree
Now it won't come back 'cause it's oh-so happy
And now I've got a hole for the world to see

And it said no, no, no, no, no, no
Said no, no, you're not the one for me

With hatred and hurt as your savior

You consume them with minimum strife
But now you have got indigestion

Find yourself up against another brick wall
See yourself as a fallen angel
Well I don't see no holes in the road but you
Find another place to fall

There isn't much more I can say
For I don't understand the delay
You're asking for friendly advice
And remaining in permanent crisis
Affection is yours if you ask
But first you must take off your mask
When you're backs turned I've decided
I'll throw it away just like I did

Find yourself another place to fall
Find yourself up against another brick wall
See yourself as a fallen angel

Do you realize the things you said never made sense?
We can sit here and laugh
But we don't know the half of it, in your defense
We've been talking a while

Lights are coming on
But they don't burn too strong
And they won't stay for long
And then they're gone again

Funnyman, gotta plan for the something wonderful
Funnyman, listening to the world turning on itself
Tuning into a brand new universe


Funnyman, you'll never be anything else

Do you remember the night
When I had to play your angel, saving your soul?
Even though you were holding on tight
Part of you was taken by your demons below
And with no more to lose
You said you feel like a bruise on a beautiful body
And all the damage you do
It is so honest and true...I don't want to feel sorry for you

You're a bird with an eye for anything shiny
Searching the land for a hero of a man
You say I need
More than my fair share of attention
But I think you know
That just isn't so

Oh underneath I felt the fire of a burning question
Tearing me apart,
Right from the very start.
And now I see,
That it don't take a trick
Of the light to excite me.
So Strong
So Long
You'll see

Hold on to what you've been given lately.
Hold on to what you know you've got.
Hold on to what you've been given lately.
Hold on 'cause the world will turn if you're ready or not.


Simplicity,
A heart of gold, an old head in young shoulders
Quiet and lovely,
Becoming part of me.
And now I see from a handful of names and a thousand faces.

One light burning
Fiercely

I was tired of January
I was tired of June
I felt a change a-coming
oh oh
I was tired of January
Tired of June
I felt a change a-coming
oh oh
I felt a change a-coming,
I felt a change a-coming,
I felt a change a-coming soon.

Hold on to what you know you've got.
Hold on to what you've been given lately.
Hold on 'cause the world will turn if you're ready or not.

Have I doubt when I'm alone
Love is a ring, the telephone
Love is an angel disguised as lust
Here in our bed until the morning comes

Come on now try and understand
The way I feel under your command
Take my hand as the sun descends
They can't touch you now
Can't touch you now, can't touch you now

Because the night belongs to lovers
Because the night belongs to lust
Because the night belongs to lovers
Because the night belongs to us

With love we sleep
With doubt the vicious circle
Turn and burns
Without you I cannot live
Forgive, the yearning burning
I believe it's time, too real to feel

So touch me now, touch me now, touch me now

Because the night belongs to lovers
Because the night belongs to lust
Because the night belongs to lovers
Because the night belongs to us

Because tonight there are two lovers
If we believe in the night we trust
Because the night belongs to lovers
Because the night belongs to lust

Because the night
Belongs to lovers
Because the night
Belongs to us",Because the Night,2009

Exotic, embryonic new world

The goddess adulteress
In your pearls

Please say it was chasing wood
While you were the President's wife

Running out the door
She got the gris-gris on

Yeah give me more

And never again
Will you be accused
Of being something you are not
In light of the incident
With that little piece of
Clothing you forgot
And now your cheveux
Has gone grey
And you're standing by the fire
Your repertoire is so stellar
I can't help but admire

My skin for a blanket, to scare winds so wild

Kuana Torres Kahele,"A long long time ago
There was a volcano
Living all alone in the middle of the sea

He sat high above his bay
Watching all the couples play
And wishing that he had someone too

And from his lava came
This song of hope that he sang out loud
Every day
For years and years

I have a dream
I hope it will come true
That you're here with me
And I am here with you
I wish that the earth, sea, and the sky up above
Will send me someone to lava

Years of singing all alone
Turned his lava into stone
Until he was on the brink of extinction
But little did he know
That living in the sea below
Another volcano
Was listening to his song

Everyday she heard his tune
Her lava grew and grew
Because she believed his song was meant for her
Now she was so ready to meet him above the sea
As he sang his song of hope for the last time

I have a dream
I hope it will come true
That you're here with me
And I am here with you
I wish that the earth, sea, and the sky up above
Will send me someone to lava

Rising from the sea below
Stood a lovely volcano
Looking all around
But she could not see him
He tried to sing to let her know
That she was not there alone
But with no lava, his song was all gone
He filled the sea with his tears
Watched his dreams disappear
As she remembered what his song meant to her

I have a dream
I hope will come true
That you're here with me
And I am here with you
I wish that the earth, sea, and the sky up above
Will send me someone to lava

Oh they were so happy
To finally meet above the sea
All together now their lava grew and grew
No longer are they all alone
With Aloha as their new home
And when you go and visit them this is what they sing

I have a dream I hope it will come true
That you will grow old with me, and I will grow old with you
We thank the earth, sea, and the sky we thank too
I lava you
I lava you
I lava you",Lava,2015

Quiero hablar, quiero ver, quiero estar why quiero ser
Why en tus brazos volver a nacer

why ahora ven why tómame
Que junto a ti yo volveré a nacer

Tal vez ayer no sea más que un recuerdo
Why tal vez el ayer se borre de nuestra piel, oh
Why tal vez, no se, el tiempo me dé el tiempo
De hablar, ver la luz de un sentimiento

No puedo no pensar en ti
Tu voz, tus ojos, tu mirar
Tu sonrisa que no está

Cambiaría por tenerte
Conmigo un segundo más
Daría todo por saber
Que también piensas en mi

why aunque el viento te alejó
Why tu cara ya no esté
Why me quede frente el mar
(Tan solo como un pez)

Ojalá que al despertar
Trates de pensar en mi
Porque yo no te olvidé why es que

Tú, eres todo para mi, todo lo que tengo yo
Why sin ti no seguiré viviendo
Tú, si es que puedes entender, yo jamás te dejaré
Aunque traten de alejarte de mi

Si estoy loco, qué me importa
De alguna forma voy a hacer
Que me devulvan de una vez
Una tarde junto a ti

Una risa, una foto
Una película después
Why una mañana te diré
Como duele el corazón

De sólo pensar que estás
Escondida en un rincón
Preguntándote por qué
Por qué, por qué

Tú, eres todo para mi, todo lo que tengo yo
Why sin ti no seguiré viviendo
Tú, si es que puedes entender, yo jamás te dejaré
Aunque traten de alejarte de mi

Tú, eres todo para mi, todo lo que tengo yo

Time be my friend, let me start again

To see where you fit in this plan
It’s a long road, long lonely road

It takes time to find the place you love
It takes time to find the place you love

Well, if you’ve got to be sure
In that feeling you’ve got to take time
It takes time to find the place you love
It’s a long road, long journey home

Kula Shaker,"Into the deep
the long forgotten sleep
You can feel that your eyes are shut closely now
Where do yu know
there's no-one that can know 
As you lie you can try to be happy now
Fly brother fly
may you feel love tonight
Fly brother fly
well I hope you meet your maker
Enter your heart
and never let it part
Yesterday was a lie so be happy now
When all you can feel is what you take as real
Come alive
realize it's a feeling

I hope you meet your maker

Con la cabeza que casi se me estalla
Y no me acuerdo si esta es mi cama
O si otra vez me desperté fue en la sala

Todo da vueltas, nada se para
Y ni el espejo reconoce esta cara
Me duele todo, estoy sin ganas
Y lo peor es que ni estoy en mi casa

Loco, me debí guardar algo pa' después
Loco me pase de copas otra vez
Loco que ahora alguien me diga que voy a hacer

Sólo recuerdo que celebraba
En una fiesta a la que todos llegaban
Muchas mujeres me presentaban
Así estaría que a todas veía guapas

Ocho tequilas, diez margaritas
Y de mi nombre yo ya ni me acordaba
Y no me agarren, que no hace falta
Que no soy yo, lo que se mueve es la casa

Loco que ahora alguien me diga que voy a hacer

Oye Diosito mío si hoy sobrevivo
Yo te prometo que desde ahora
No beberé más nunca otra gota

Y pa' que veas que no estoy mintiendo
Y que en el alma lo estoy sintiendo
Y que me estoy arrepintiendo
Brindo por lo que estoy prometiendo

Loco me pase de copas otra vez
Loco me debí guardar algo pa' después
Loco me pase de copas otra vez
Loco que ahora alguien me diga que voy a hacer

why hoy levanto mi copa por ti baby (uoo uooo)
Ya no voy a llorar nunca por ti baby (ya no llorare por ti)
Why este trago de olvido es por ti baby (uooaaaaaa uooooaaaaaa)

Vamos a aclarar solo una vez mas hoy estoy tomando, no lo hago porque me haces falta, ciego estaba yo esa es la verdad, todo porque los consejos que me daban no escuchaba.
Hoy estoy en el bar, yo soy el galán, tengo nuevo carro, nueva ropa, why traigo nueva niña.
Si estoy bebiendo porque estoy contento desde te fuiste tu olor ya no siento.

why me siento bien no me quejare vine a celebrar que tu ya te haz marchado pero en realidad vamos a brindar por el gran papel de niña buena que habías jugado.
Why pensar que yo creí en tu amor hoy me he dado cuenta que yo estaba tan equivocado.
Brindo por mi donde quiera que estés, ya no encontrarás quien te haga mujer.
Why hoy levanto mi copa por ti baby (uoo uooo)
Ya no voy a llorar nunca por ti baby (ya no llorare por ti)
Why este trago de olvido es por ti baby (uooaaaaaa uooooaaaaaa)

Levanta la mano si quieres brindar
Que diga su madre por ya no esta
Levanta tu copa para celebrar
Esa traicionera ya no volverá why voy a tomar me voy a embriagar porque ya no tengo que aguantar a quien me este mintiendo si estoy bebiendo porque estoy contento why se que no existe el dolor que hoy siento.

why hoy levanto mi copa por ti baby (uoo uooo)
Ya no voy a llorar nunca por ti baby (ya no llorare por ti)

Pero quedaste en mi alma, mi alma
Por más que brille la luna en mi ventana
Si no estas todo me falta, me falta

Paso tras paso
Yo se que te vas acercando a mi
Aunque sea largo el camino te voy a esperar
Siempre aquí

Vuelve, que yo te sigo esperando
Vuelve, para quedarte a mi lado
Vuelve, que todo sigue en su sitio
Vuelve, verás que nada ha cambiado

Vuelve, que todavía te espero
Vuelve, para quedarte a mi lado
Vuelve, por favor vuelve
Que estoy esperando que vengas a mí

Es hora de pensar en un cuerpo real
Que no desaparezca entre mis manos
Que yo pueda sentir, que yo pueda tocar
Como la melodía de un piano

Si quieres, vamos, nos cojemos
Nos tiramos, nos merecemos
Nos maltratamos
Sin lavarnos las manos, cariño
A veces no basta con que queramos

Digo tu nombre de nuevo
Y a veces creo, que estoy perdiendo la calma, la calma
Y cada noche despierto cuando siento
Tu voz que siempre me llama, me llama

Paso tras paso
Yo se que te vas acercando a mí
Aunque sea largo el camino te voy a esperar
Siempre aquí

Vuelve, que yo te sigo esperando
Vuelve, para quedarte a mi lado
Vuelve, que todo sigue en su sitio
Vuelve, verás que nada ha cambiado

Vuelve, que todavía te espero
Vuelve, para quedarte a mi lado
Vuelve, por favor vuelve
Que estoy esperando que vengas a mí

Un beso flotando en el aire nos quedara
Mi amor, te pienso
No me dejes de pensar

En cada radio del barrio, suena mi canción
Quiero que llegue a tu casa y tu corazón
Vuelve, que todavía te espero

Kung Fu Vampire,"I'm the big dog, all you puppies stop barking
Bow down when the homie come around
The underground wicked, support this shit
When you bump this shit out the truck, punk bitch
Get it jumping like I hit the switch, or the Bourbon
Bouncing and swerving, on the black top serving
Riding on them bitches like I'm thrashing on a board
Or hopping on some X-Games, watch me as I soar
Bitches can't ignore when I'm banging on the ave
With that wicked shit bumping, I'mma rep it till my last
I'm the present, I'm the past, thirsty bitches make me laugh
Always searching for their relevance, looking like an ass
So I stay celibate to bullshit, trust no bitch
Don't fuck with them suckas, them whack motherfuckers
Keep your lips smacking, mouth running for weeks
Bullets do the talking when the dead man speaks, motherfucker

(You can't save me, I'm a- )
I'm the living dead pounding out the stereo
Rip the speakers in half, turn it up, here we go
I brought the cemetery with me on the track
And I'm cruising down the strip with dead bodies in the back
Human skeletons, come on, nod your cords
Zombies, vampires, killers and all of y'all

Motherfucker kick rocks, I'll divide you in your sock
Shoes dangle from the wire in the middle of the block
Your blood pours from wounds, bullets had to penetrate
Perforate the skin as they center bones with dance
Street safe silent no snitching
Keep it hungry or you could be the next one missing
Power Man like Luke Cage, with the chains in the case
Not a hero for hire but I'm making the front page
I'm center stage, doing what I love
Music is my drug, hitting harder than Terrell Suggs
Bump this right here till it's rattling your rearview
Pardon on the block, give a fuck, a bottle hits you
Dead man in a dead beef since this week
Taking over motherfucking streets, get geeked
Get down, get laid, get bread, get head
Anyway you want it, get it bitch, get it till you're dead

(You can't save me, I'm a- )
I'm the living dead pounding out the stereo
Rip the speakers in half, turn it up, here we go

Human skeletons, come on, nod your cords
Zombies, vampires, killers and all of y'all

I keep a small circle
Got a lot of acquaintances, I'm universal
This is a business so don't take it personal
Invisible, I’m an outer space alien in pencil
Vein you draining your blood for real
Tell the officer watching me we just filming a commercial
Dead girls, they don't say no
Best friends are phlebotomus
I'm at the rock bottomless
Mimosas the colleges, psychologists analyze
How to get that Molly in a poly metabolically, Alli
Over your head, peon
Hoping the bed we on
Leaving you glowing neon
You can't fuck with the flow that we on
I would offer you Menaka
It's for all that shit that you talking
I'm a nightmare when I'm walking, bitter really killing me
You can looking into my soul as I'm stalking
Decapicate all of you hoes in a coffin
I soften them first, chop 'em up then hop in the hearse
Shit could be worse
Come on down, we the living dead
Basket case, now let's get in your head
I'm a ghost

Kung Pao!
Episode two, 
The continuing adventures of the Kung Pao buckaroos.

The three cowboys needed a place to bed down for the night.
So I suggested the establishment of Miss Kitty May,
(Or she may not).
A former love and a woman of questionable repute.

So they walked into the saloon and asked for Miss Kitty.
And just then, they heard a voice saying,
""Hi, boys. You lookin' for these.""
And the littlest cowboy turned around to see two huge 38s pointed right at his face.
(Jimmy, you can't say that!)
(What? She had huge guns.)
Smith and Wesson revolvers.
Oh boy, were they loaded.
(Oh brother)

Cornography.

She's aiming them right at us.
(Softer, George, it's more effective.)
She's aiming them right at us.
Everybody duck!
Not you, Jimmy. You stand up normal.

They dropped the money they owed her, an' she bent over to pick it up,
And, oh, that moon was beautiful.
(Now Jimmy, you can't say that!).
Out the window. I couldn't see it till then George:
There were mountains in the way.

Cornography.

""You guys are gonna get in trouble for this.""
That woman sure chaps my.
Ask her out then.
I think he's got a little thing for her, George.
(Louder, Bill, it's more effective.)
I think he's got a little thing for her, George.
It's not THAT little.
(That was worth the trip over here.)
All, right, Jimmy, let's get serious now.

So the little cowboy was tryin' not to act too excited.
But when I look at a woman that beautiful, it's hard.
(Jimmy!!!).
What? It's very difficult.
I hope they're not recordin' this.
Yeah.
Ah.

Cornography.

An' I said: ""Little cowgirl, how would you like a little cowpoke?""
""Here we go.""
Ooh yeah. Need a little buckaroo?
In your dreams short barrell.
Bum chicka bow wow.
Oh my God.
So the Kung Poo Buck, Kung Poo!

Kung Pao Buckaroos,"And now the grand old opera theater proudly presents
a special holiday edition of the Adventures of the Kung Pao Buckaroos

Well, it's a Kung Pao Buckaroo Holiday
Whatever you do watch what you say
If you're easily offended well that's okay
It's a completely non-offensive and politically correct holiday

We catch up with our three cowboys one cold
December night huddled around the camp fire.

How 'bout we sing some holiday songs?
Yeah, hey George, you wanna lead us off?
Yeah, I got one.

Oh Chri-biip-mas tree oh Chri-biip-mas tree how lovely are thou branched?

Why am I getting blipped again?
Haven't you heard guys? You can't say Chri-biip-mas you gotta say Holiday
I can't say Chri-biip-mas?
No you might offend somebody.
Who is offended by Chri-biip-mas?
You know you might offend the biiiip and the biiiip and the atheists.
What?
Time to politically correct.

I'll lead this off.

On the first day of Chri-biip-mas my true love said to me?

Jimmy, are you listening?
What?
You can't say Chri-biip-mas.
Why not?
You can say biiiip on the last record.
Why can't I say Chri-biip-mas?
I didn't make the rules.
Hey listen guys, it's not that difficult,
all you gotta do is change Chri-biip-mas to Holiday.
You know, instead of saying white Chri-biip-mas, you say
I'm dreaming of a whi-biiip Holiday.
Why did I get blipped?
You've got to say Caucasian.
So I have to sing, I'm dreaming of a Caucasian holiday?
Sure, that won't offend anybody.

Well, it's a Kung Pao Buckaroo Holiday,
Whatever you do watch what you say
If you're easily offended well that's okay

Why do these people have to feel that way?
How come they get offended so easily?

It's a completely non-offensive and politically correct holiday

I'm just trying to come up with a song here.
Let's sing one together, everybody ready? George?
Ready.
Bill your ready?
I'm ready.
Jimmy? Jimmy? Jimmy?
Okay!

We three kings of biiiiiiiiip are bearing gifts we've traveled real far

Sorry boys, you have to say Asia now.
What?
Oh, come on just try.

We three kings of Asia are

That sounds like horse biiiip
Oh lord, okay. How 'bout Little Drummer boy?
Nope, that offends short people.
And you can't say drummer 'cause that will offend real musicians.

How 'bout little town of meddle hell.
What's this with all the short jokes?

Hey how 'bout we do Silent Night?
No, it'll offend people who's hard to hear and afraid of the dark.
What did he say about a shark?
Shark?

This happens every year.

Well, it's a Kung Pao Buckaroo Holiday,
Whatever you do watch what you say,
If you're easily offended well that's okay,
It's a completely non-offensive and politically correct holiday.

Hohoho!
No.
I can't say ho?
No you might offend some women.
So basically we can't sing anything?

I think that a bunch of bull biiiip.
Softer George it's more effective.
I think that a bunch of bull biiiip.
You now what? I don't care who we offend,
I'm gonna sing Chri-biip-mas carols if I wanna sing Chri-biip-mas carols.
Louder man it's more effective.
I don't care who we offend,
I'm gonna sing Chri-biip-mas carols if I wanna sing Chri-biip-mas carols.
Me too.

We wish you a merry Chri-biip-mas, we wish you a merry Chri-biip-mas,
we wish you a merry Chri-biip-mas, and a happy ne-biip year.

We can't say new, it'll offend the old folks.

Kuniva,"Daddy's really comin' home, just hold tight
I just don't know how long I'll be gone this time
Just keep my picture on the wall, baby girl don't cry
'Cause I don't know when I'll be home

Ever since I was young, it's been my dream
To be successful doin' this music thing
Music is a part of my soul
I'll be sixty years old, still on the road

A grown ass man tryin' to make a livin'
A grown ass man makin' grown man decisions
Relax, I don't want you to work
Let me go out here and put in the dirt

I'll buy you a skirt, brand new Coach purse
Whenever I leave, I know it still hurts
What you want a watch, a bracelet or a chain?
How about my chest? A tattoo of your name

Man, I'm sick of all this luggage that I'm rattlin'
Trust me, I'm sick of flights and all this travelin'
Two weeks in the UK, three days in Hong Kong
It won't be long, I'll be home

Daddy's really comin' home, just hold tight
I just don't know how long I'll be gone this time
Just keep my picture on the wall, baby girl don't cry
'Cause I don't know when I'll be home

Look, your daddy has to hit the road
And I know you're gettin' old enough to notice that I'm gone
And I know I'm your best friend, the one that you look up to
Some people think I'm overprotective but I just love you

And even though I'm gone I'd rather be home with you
And no matter where I'm at your daddy is gon' miss you
You're my little man so be nice to your baby sister
And give mommy a big hug for daddy and kiss her

'Cause I know she gets tired, at times I feel guilty
I wish that I could take y'all with me
But it's crazy out here and I don't wanna expose you
To the frustrations of this rap game that I go through

And honestly I don't even do it for me
I do it so we could live life comfortably
And that's why I wear y'all proudly around my neck
And I don't care who last said it, daddy has your respect
And just know that

Daddy's really comin' home, just hold tight
I just don't know how long I'll be gone this time
Just keep my picture on the wall, baby girl don't cry
'Cause I don't know when I'll be home

Beep, beep, man, here comes the van
I wanna thank Mathew Knowles for giving me a chance
Got the advance, now it's time to hit the streets
And I'll be home in three and a half weeks

What college you goin' to? That's your decision
Just know that I'll be here to pay your tuition
The only daddy you know and that's on the real
And I been takin' care of you since Murray Ill

I moved down south, big old house
Got you two horses and a lake full of trout
And Sundays I put on my new house shoes
Lookin' at TV, watchin' the Lions lose

I miss Papi, Pug, Pepper and Patches
Man, I can't go to sleep on that brand new mattress
Even though I mix music in the band
Big Boi and Dave, see you at Lake Ann

Daddy's really comin' home, just hold tight
I just don't know how long I'll be gone this time
Just keep my picture on the wall, baby girl don't cry

Yeah bet you hate the news holmes
You probably somewhere
Sittin' on the stoop huh
Sippin' on a brew
Plottin' to pop me later huh

I'm too great on a song
I push weight on the corner
Send weight to the coroner
When courage make 'em turn performer

Verses lettin' a perilous nigga
With no purpose
Continue to walk this earth's surface
I was birthed for hip-hop
Branch out my services
Ya try to murder this nigga
That's comin' from the same turf as ya
What nerves of yous
Pissed because your hussles ain't worth a shit
I'm gettin' rich, I'm on my way to Hugh Hefner's

On another rapper's dick

Where beef collide, shootouts happen and hit the wrong guy
I done seen the worst of the worst, and what can be worse
Than a verse about bullets dispersed up in your shirt
The streets is like a curse, niggas frontin' for a bitch
It's like you beggin to die like bear huntin with a switch
A part of my heart is gone, I can never smile the same
Trigger finger is itchy, it'll take a while to tame
Detroit is hella Dirty but the Dozen can fix it
Resist and a biscuit will excede the distance
And bounce off one's home, hit and ricochet
Off a kid's trombone right to where you niggas lay

Since raw coke was rushed through my umbilical
And no words from Ca$h mouth is fiction
Ready to throw clips if, I'm never dissin you
My aura awards raw to the core and the surface
Of the street, when I walk through the door, my purpose
Is to move up, pull tools you purp'in
Watch me overthrow the government for my interpret
Plot of Bin Laden, soul of Mumia
I'm prayin' to Proof, I'm Searching for Jerry Garcia
Talk to my brother, gone in the streets of the D
I'm totin' the K, and hawk niggas waitin on me
You take the first shot then, Second Round's on Me
And when you walk, on the other side of me, and my brother ride
I don't rap for the plaques
My contract's signed just for scratch to get you wacked
Nigga, with a gun, with a shank, with a bat
Take a slug through the lung, get it right, what you wack nigga

It'll lift him up, believe me you'll float
The result is your family heartbroke
Lookin' like an artichoke vegetable, hold stiff
Nigga paralyzed from the neck down, my goons stick niggas
Turn soldiers to stick figures, hand on triggers
Real life, born killers, we roll out like four-wheelers
God shill us, from back-stabbers and goldiggers
Tipsy off brown liquor, watch me
Obnoxious, broads call me cocky
Poppy long dick Stat beat up the box like hockey
Especially when a bitch ride dick like jockeys

Is to move up, pull tools you purp'in
Watch me overthrow the government for my interpret
Plot of Bin Laden, soul of Mumia
I'm prayin' to Proof, I'm Searching for Jerry Garcia
Talk to my brother, gone in the streets of the D
I'm totin' the K, and hawk niggas waitin on me
You take the first shot then, Second Round's on Me
And when you walk, on the other side of me, and my brother ride
I don't rap for the plaques
My contract's signed just for scratch to get you wacked
Nigga, with a gun, with a shank, with a bat
Take a slug through the lung, get it right, what you wack nigga
I'm born crazed deranged and more famous
Than clappin' down bangers meant, for entertainment, geah

Cryyyyy now, cry now
Cryyyyy now, cry now
Cryyyyy now, cry now
Cryyyyy now, nigga cry now

Young Stat keep the gat on tuck
Want war, I don't give a fuck
Shot 'til you kiss, pucker up
It'll lift him up, believe me you'll float
The result is your family heartbroke
Lookin' like an artichoke vegetable, hold stiff
Nigga paralyzed from the neck down, my goons stick niggas
Turn soldiers to stick figures, hand on triggers
Real life, born killers, we roll out like four-wheelers
God shill us, from back-stabbers and goldiggers
Tipsy off brown liquor, watch me
Obnoxious, broads call me cocky
Poppy long dick Stat beat up the box like hockey
Especially when a bitch ride dick like jockeys
From the Benz, to the Range, to the black jalopy
I'm the shit, the only one who ain't heard is Foxy
Formalize the plan, no man can stop me
Boss hog, Stat Quo understand, you copy?
(You copy?)

Cryyyyy now, cry now

Kuno Alexander,"Got a little rhythm, a rhythm, a rhythm
That pit-apats through my brain;
So darn persistent,
The day isn't distant
When it'll drive me insane.

Comes in the morning
Without any warning,
And hangs around me all day.
I'll have to sneak up to it
Someday, and speak up to it.
I hope it listens when I say

Fascinating Rhythm,
You've got me on the go!
Fascinating Rhythm, 
I'm all a-quiver.

What a mess you're making!
The neighbors want to know
Why I'm always shaking
Just like a flivver.
Each morning I get up with the sun 
Start a-hopping,
Never stopping 
O find at night no work has been done.

I know that
Once it didn't matter 
But now you're doing wrong
When you start to patter
I'm so unhappy.
Won't you take a day off?
Decide to run along
Somewhere far away off 
And make it snappy!

Oh, how I long to be the man I used to be!

Oh, won't you stop picking on me?","Fascinatin' Rhythm, song (from Lady, Be Good!, musical)",1992
Kuno Alexander,"When the mellow moon begins to beam,
Every night I dream a little dream,
And of course Prince Charming is the theme,
The he for me.
Although I realize as well as you
It is seldom that a dream comes true,
To me it's clear
That he'll appear.

Some day he'll come along,
The man I love
And he'll be big and strong,
The man I love
And when he comes my way
I'll do my best to make him stay.

He'll look at me and smile
I'll understand,
And in a little while,
He'll take my hand,
And though it seems absurd,
I know we both won't say a word

Maybe I shall meet him Sunday
Maybe Monday, maybe not,
Still I'm sure to meet him one day
Maybe Tuesday will be my good news day

He'll build a little home
Just meant for two,
From which I'll never roam,
Who would, would you?
And so all else above
I'm waiting for the man I love.","The Man I Love, song (from Strike Up the Band, 1st version; orig. composed",1992

It was Heaven's plan
There should be a girl for every single man.

I may meet himher yet.

Somebody loves me, I wonder who,
I wonder who heshe can be.

Es waren zwei Brüder, Rashid und Aziz 
Flüchtlinge aus 'nem kleinen Dorf Falastin's
Von klein auf hatten sie Respekt in der Ader
Keine Widerrede, sie hören auf ihren Vater
Sie gehen Freitag gemeinsam zur Moschee, 
Bitten um Vergebung für den toten Bruder ein Gebet
Aziz, der jeden Morgen ganz allein im Bus sitzt 
Will mal Arzt werden, weil es Mama's Wunsch ist
Und Rashid will sich als Mann rächen
Nach der Schule will er für sein Land kämpfen
Das Geld ist knapp, doch sie kämpfen weiter
Teilen sich das Pausenbrot, teilen sich die Kleider
Die Mutter oft allein', traurig, sie weint dann. 
Sie wünscht sich eine Tochter, dann wär' sie nicht mehr einsam
Sie betet zu Gott, sie nahm' ihr dein Geschenk 
Und ein Jahr später kommt Lydia auf die Welt

Wir machen so vieles falsch, doch verzeihen wenig
Die Zeit vergeht, der Zeiger dreht sich
Du veränderst dich, doch merkst's erst wenn's zu spät ist
Wenn es dann zu spät ist bereuen wir es ewig

Lydia ist jetzt Vier, lernt langsam zu sprechen
Aziz ist jetzt 20 studiert Medizin
Mama zu liebe, ja einfach aus Prinzip
Rashid ist jetzt achtzehn, trägt mit sich ein Messer
Macht nur noch Probleme, seine Freunde sind Verbrecher
Nur noch dieses eine Mal, dann der Ruhestand
Er kauft 'ne Kette, für Lydia zum Geburtstag
Er küsst ihre Stirn, legt sie auf den Schoß
„Ich beschütz dich, jeden Tag, ich schwör's auf mein' Tod“, 
Rashid nimmt die Regeln der Familie nicht mehr ernst
Deswegen wird Rashid von der Familie entehrt
Ja die Zeit vergeht auch ohne ihn
Er fällt tiefer und tiefer und tiefer
Einbrechen, Drogen dealen
Ja es war Rashid, der Junge aus dem Krieg, 
In Geld und Ruhm verliebt, vom Teufel besiegt

Wir machen so vieles falsch, doch verzeihen wenig

Du veränderst dich, doch merkst's erst wenn's zu spät ist

Es sind Acht Jahre her, es hat sich nichts verändert
Es bleibt wie es ist, Rashid bleibt ein Fremder
Lydia ist jetzt 12, heute auf dem Schulweg
Glaub mir die letzten Zeilen hier, sie tun weh
Es ist Freitags morgens, auf der Straße nichts los
Rashid und Freunde kommen besoffen aus der Disko
Sie steigen in den Wagen, ja sie sind zu viert
Rashid fährt und denkt sich „Was hab' ich zu verlieren?“
„Gib mal Gas, Junge, willst du mich verarschen?“
Er gibt Gas und bemerkt da ist jemand auf der Straße
Er will stoppen, doch leider ist es zu spät
Er trifft das Mädchen auf dem Schulweg

Die frechen Jungs, wir saßen in der Klasse ganz hinten
Wir waren Slumdogs, die Wasser aus der Hand trinken
In diesem Slum Junge gibt es keinen Paragraph
Leb dein Leben, Lifestyle Bar-Allah
Ja, man wir liebten diesen Lifestyle
Tun was wir wollen, dreckig und frei sein
Wir hatten keinen Spielplatz, Leben Stil extrem
Wir spielten auf dem Bordstein
Benz zählen
Fünf beste Freunde, wir hatten keine Kinokarten
Einer nahm das Geld und vier mussten vor'm Kino warten
Wenn er raus kommt, erzählt er uns den Film
Er bewegt sich wie im Film, Mann das Leben war so wild
Spring um dein Leben, von Gartenzaun zu Gartenzaun
Mit vollen Tüten, Früchte aus dem Garten klauen
Kämpfen war Alltag, meine Straße gegen deine
Deswegen haben wir Narben auf dem Kopf von den Steinen

Wir haben im Schlamm gespielt, haben uns am Fluss gewaschen
Meine Kindheit war ein Traum, ich würd' es keine Stunde hassen
Diese Jungs, die gegen Regel verstoßen
Wurden von zu Hause aus mit Schlägen erzogen
Wir lernten schnell, auf der Straßen gibt es kein Vertrauen
Ja, auf der Straße haben wir nach der Schule Eis verkauft
Pyjamahose, Unterhemd, scheiß drauf, ich muss weiter sparen
Gutes Essen, schicke Kleider gab es nur an Feiertagen
Und wir sahen wie Helikopter über's Land fliegen
Mann, wir taten so als würden wir sie abschießen
Ich hab's geliebt, schlafen auf dem Dach
Der Sonnenschein am Morgen, die Straße macht uns wach
Bei den Nachbarn essen, zu vertieft in Armut
Scheiß drauf, wir hatten Spaß, Fußball spielen barfuß
Nach dem Spiel gab es Eis oder Tee
Ausruhen und dann liefen wir Gemeinsam zur Moschee

Sorry, aber Leute wie ich dulden keinen besten Freund
Wir waren Newcomer (yeah)
Heute setzen wir einen Meilenstein
Irgendwann wollen sie den zweiten Teil
Ich hab' einen Daimlerstern und ich reise gern
Nach der vierten Immobilien habe ich kein Heimweh mehr
Und wenn ein Türsteher denkt, dass er breiter wär
Wird es Zeit für mein drittes Meisterwerk (BADT)

Von Beruf Gauner, weil wir jetzt am Zuge sind

Auf der Anklagebank und die Haare glänzen
Über die Strafe lächeln dank Staranwälten

(Check it)

[ VERSE 1 ]
Okay, time period 5 B.C.
5 years before money and crack was a priority
(Authority) figures loomin like dark skies
(Sittin in class, second hand movin clock wise)
Patiently waitin for the bell to ring (ring)
There it is, I gather my things
(Backpack over my shoulder, like a soldier I troop)
Uptown, sportin a frown (cause you're wearin a corny suit)
I metamorphasize from the shirt and ties
(What else?) laces in shoes ain't fly (it's a pack of lies)
Hm - now that's more likely
Pumas, mocknecks (and maybe like a pair of Lee's)
Yeah, I feel fantastic
Sneak out the house cause mama's rules was mad drastic
(""Boy, stay in the house,"" she says)
""Yo mom, no disrespect
And jetted out the door, you know that I jet
(Real quick outside) so I could be among
Yeah, my friends, how I miss bein young

	Jorge, Jorge, Jorge of the projects		(repeated)

[ VERSE 2 ]
Fun years are over (and now here comes)
A period of time, respect is measured in lump sums
Of money (drugs, thugs are cool)
Word up, chumps get slung (kids droppin outta school
Girls add fuel to the fire if you're a bum)
Word up, bottomline is: (kid, you're gettin none)
(No play at all) cause they want Shirlings
Fat bangle bracelets (the matching earrings)
Brothers, they be fallin victim to the trickin
The life is finger lickin good (just like the chicken)
Don't count em all (word up, until they hatch)
The story sounds good (shit, but there's a catch)
Jorge (Jorge of the projects)
Made the choice to gain material objects
(Pushin Ac Legends up the block)
Stock is on the rise (from the flip of a rock)
So he chills (in the fat-ass joint)
Point fingers (favors linger in the mind)
He got his (and you know I got mine)
But for now it's about that time

	Jorge, Jorge, Jorge of the projects		(repeated)

[ VERSE 3 ]
Humble, t-t-tumblin down (word up, the shit which allows)
Someone to be a nice guy (Kurious Jorge)
Tell ya straight, respect (to my mother) like no other
(Cause I love you to death)
Trife (project life) yeah you might say that
Murder crimes and (drugs) man, they're goin way back
When (some by the pen straight out the ghetto)
(Expose the hate) but try to be a kind fellow
Still mellow is the trait I choose to uphold
(By means a peace died) . 45 (now hold)
(Go) Aiyo, Amp, spark the biff
(Come on, Jorge, what you be meanin?) Dummy - the fat spliff
(I guess times are great, so celebrate the celebration)
Word up, vacation from the projects (cause the object is inflation)
Of my bank book (which you don't have)
Shut up, cause maybe some day (sure you'll have a whole lot of money)
(Aiyo, honey, no need to change the topic)
Word up, and Jorge'll be Jorge (Jorge of the projects)

Kurious,"Ah yeah
It's the fat joint right here
Here we...
This joint right here is dedicated to
Well, I'm not malicious
But all those whose words vicious
Talkin behind the back
This shit is wack

Here we go
You need to walk like a duck (walk like a duck)
Walk like a duck (walk like a duck)
You need to walk like a duck (walk like a duck)
Say what? (Like a muthafuckin duck!)				
You need to walk like a duck (walk like a duck)

[ VERSE 1 ]
Kurious was never one for ring around
The rosie, not Josey, but I mosey on down
To a meadow where the flowers stay wilted
So what I ain't hit as many skins as Wilt the Stilt did
It's like that, never labelled a wack
And yo, they choose behind my back to do the Duckville quack
My style is cool, sweet like a ???
But still (what?) you gossip like a bitch
Mental stimulation when I'm rollin with the rat pack
If you're frontin rock, get the doodoo out your knap sack
The fat track provided by the Beat' got you goin
'nuts kickin butts, underneath be when I'm flowin
I'm knowin, you frontin-ass ducks is gettin smeared
My crew rolls thick like a hillbilly's beard
Constipated Monkeys gettin to the point quick
Like my man Apache said: yo, get off (MY DICK!)

[ VERSE 2 ]
It's like that and - ah
Didn't go to Georgia, took the train to Alabama
On the midnight tip like Gladys Knight and the Pips
My sole intention bein to move the marrow in your hips
Family confusion's what motivates the rhymer
Got an aunt named Tom, uncle named Jemima
Kurious Jorge on the welfare line
Plus American Airline never prepared mine
Ears for the poppin, hands for the clappin
If I sense turbulence, commence to see the captain
Two strikes, your motion got a notion of funk
I must prescribe a mint (why?) cause your breath stunk
(Ill) I paid the bills, sent a check to my mama
If you try to wreck my mind, there's mad drama
I'ma deliver one worm for the hawk
Eliminatin quacks on the duck walk

[ VERSE 3 ]
I drop limes like you drop mescaline
Tabs on my tongue as I swung from the swing
And came up with that thing they call 'Walk Like a Duck'
Quite frankly don't give a fuck
Mama raised me humble, so I never ever label
Myself as the best, cause some of the rest got more flavor
But that's okay, beyond a shadow of a doubt
I got skills, I ain't conceited, but still might take you out
Half Puertorican, half Cuban, not Fidel
Castro, like an astro you know I excel
Time to sell mad units, scratchin on my pubics
Complicate confusion like a ?Nick Kubrick? on a Rubik
Who kicks the bubbles that allow the truth to surface?
I never will delete, so I don't defeat the purpose
Slapshot the gift like a hockey puck
Ha-ha, you fuckin duck",Walk Like a Duck,1994
Kurious,"Yo Jorge, what's up, man?
Yo, I'm chillin, what's up, what's goin on, man?
	Yo, I'm coolin man, but I'm like worried about you, uknowmsayin?
Why you worried about me, man?
	Cause, yo man, you be drinkin a lot, you know
	Everytime I see you you got a 40
Nah man, I'm just chillin, knowmsayin?

Nope, the beat is dope, so acknowledge the tic
Toc of the clock, cause times are changing
Me sweatin girls, man, that's back in the days when
I was naive, kinda young, mighta even brung
Flowers to your door, but be damn sure
Those days are no more, so classify em as ancient history
Mysery was caused cause your wack way of thinkin
Breath stinkin cause I'm sittin here drinkin
A 40 gettin naughty, then my thoughts start linkin
Together, back-trackin, never was into girl-slappin
Releasin tension by grabbin the mic and rappin
Gifts with ribbons, when will this madness cease
You played me like a pair of Lee's with a permanent crease
All I ever wanted was for us to rock 'n roll
Ha-ha - Nikole

But all's well, you see, I'm a survivor
Carnivore - you, played the role of
Never makin any attemps to show love
But that's okay, see, I'm not a first grader
Don't need attention, need not mention that I'm greater
So later for that, cause I'm not the type for braggin
Just like my jeans my self-esteem was saggin
Pick up a 40 or a six of the stout draught
My life was hittin, know what exactly I'm talkin about
The style that flips, the sips of the 40 ounce
To the bounce I got more, so I score
One thing's for sure: understand and comprehend
Before you play yourself like a trend I send
A little word of advice, Fisher Price toy I'm not
Man, I ain't a boy, thought you mighta forgot
The song I sing cause your ill mood swings low
Merry Christmas to a ho-ho-ho
Play the role of Santa Clause, so save the drama
Tell you straight up, just like I was from Alabama
You really need to start treatin people better
I regret the day I met her

Yo man
why'all givin me a hard time
Leave me alone, I ain't sweatin her, man
	Aiyo Jorge, man, skeez' come a dime a dozen

The games you play really taught me a lesson
All dressed up, but in disguise they were a blessin
So I say thanks, but now it's time for me to step
Kurious Jorge, you know you shoulda never slept
On me, but girl, you know that's not what I'm about
You're (wack) and I'm out

Last seen pulling chicks like a fiend pull a fast one
Can't put shit past him
Got niggas on his own team mad enough to blast him
Retarded in real life, on the mic Rain Man
Stand close to his main man like a chain gang
Who give a fuck about who or they fancy crew
That's no mystery that Hardy Boys do with Nancy Drew
Sorta with her drawers down quarter
The extorter bring slaughter like ""Well I oughta""
I suggest you hand over the formula doula
A villain in your land, in his land a ruler
Hard hitting like puffing a woola with Lieutenant Uhura
Every day feel like it's an off day with Ferris Bueller
Brother pull heat to prove they not sweet
No matter how you spell it, we still got beats

Don't question how we live, question what we give
Take it to the next leave 'em where they can't see me
Still they judge, but they be butt ass
Twist that wig like a muppet, keep it simple, can't truss it
Light's the fuel, mic is the tool
Drink Jack, kick back, drop jewel, finish what I start
Mastered the art, living hell can't explain it
Inhale confuse it more, cop the .44

By candlelight my hand will write these rhymes 'til I'm burnt out
Mostly from experience, shit that I learned about
Topics and views, generally concerned about
With different ways to come up and earn clout
I take a look at my life and pace the trails
From Tablik and savage females with fake nails to face veils
You out your frame but still bagging 'em too
You know I know, these hoes be asking me if I'm you
Like my twin brother, we did everything together
From hundred raka'at salats to copping butter leathers
Remember when you went and got the dark blue Ballys
I had all the different color Cazals and Gazelles
The ""SUBROC"" three-finger ring with the ruby in the ""O"", ock
Truly the illest dynamic duo on the whole block
I keep a flick of you with the machete sword in your hand

And polluted the seas 
They burned all the forests
Or cut down the trees
They damned up the rivers
And paved all the shores
Built parking lots
And discount stores

But not fast enough
So, they shot at each other
With bullets and stuff

That's not the way that I am

Angels cry and demons laugh
Another suicide bomb blood bath

Angels cry, we all die

Mother earth wept
As they tore off her dress
Heart broken, humiliated
In a state of distress
They ripped out her hair
And they scratched at her skin 
Drained her of her fluids 
Then committed their sin
They gouged out her eyes
And cauterized her womb 
They sealed up her mouth 
And made her a tomb
Now she lies still
At the mercy of man
I whisper in her ear

Love is wild in her. I confuse her love with the sea.
She is a rare and emerald fantasy told to me
and to me it seems that she lives in a mystery.

But her kisses! I dig her kisses.
While washing the dishes or feeding the fishes.
It's her kisses. Her k-k-k-k-k-k-kisses.
It's her kisses. Kisses that'll make you holler loudly
that you're glad enough to be a man.

Vs. 2
And in the evening - later - after dark
she quietly reveals to me all her miracles
Flying all up around me everywhere,
just like a fountain springing up around my eyes - a love!
I'm in a shower of a lovely one.
She makes the sun rise and set for me.

Oh, gotta' make her stay
because she's got a wiggle that'll make a clock stop.
I dig her even when we're apart.
Digging on my baby's really getting me high
& making me sigh & helping me fly
back to the woman who could tease old Frankenstein's suture-boy to living.

Moxie is as moxie does & she is moxie with the kind of moxie love she's giving.
And I know she'll never ever need forgiving
with kisses that will make you say you're glad enough to be a man.

Vs. 3
And she giggles when she talks.
And she's happy if we go to the races & party or not.
And she squeezes all the living daylights out of me.
And if I ever should sever the tether that keeps us together
forever where never a tear or a sorrow could weather
the amorist passion that flashes from in her eyes
- I'd be a dunce -
if i should ever try to walk or try to stray into any other woman's arms.

Because I dig her kisses -
the kind that I like because they're warm & tasty
and they're good and chewy and I like 'em.
And you would dig them too, if you could ever get
a kiss from my sweet miss.
But we will be kissing and kissing & so you'll never ever
get a taste of heaven - that I know & guarantee that you will never see.

A bucket of loving is what she brings to me. She is my sweetie.
with kissing - loving - hugging that'l make you glad just to be a man.

They live only for the dream of living so come follow where they will take you there.

I once was apprenticed to a man who was living
In the eye if the hurricane to know despair,

He knew all the dreams by heart just like sailing in a boat of
crystal silence seeing visions of the world of life within a life.

In a turning like a burning came turning 
Out of everything stirring and what had begun before

But all wrapped up in one great godly becoming -
Tumbling and fumbling and stumbling
Into bumbling and rumbling along -

Whirling it and swirling it and twirling it and hurling it 
And overturning it and burning it again.

I shared a whirling dervish out on the side of a hill called metaphor vivace
Swinging en route to a nascent solar with the scissored visored blizzard wizard 
Gizzarding planets and secrets within like an avatar.

While meanwhile in turn styling and spinning over him
Spells bespeaking kingdoms in the dark

Calling me to yield knighting me in a field covered with armies
And with princes. All were signing cannons shining pennants flying.

And when he spoke to me he sang and his words really rang -
This child of the knowledge of the beauty of the night -

He sang to me of masters passing on of father after father after father
Climbing up into the lotus bloom upon the tortoise's back

And of grandfathers who danced through their living a longer time ago.
He showed me a palace in time in which all the talismans
From all the zeuses swing upon a pendulum of secrets
In a circle that remembers and when asked a question will surren",Night Dreamer,2000

that love was sent from above
yet, today, find my love has flown away
I am without my love

They ask me how I knew 
My true love was true
I of course reply
Something deep inside
Cannot be denied

They said someday you'll find
All who love are absolutely blind
When your heart's on fire
You must realise
Smoke gets in your eyes

So I chaffed them
And I gayly laughed
that they would doubt my love
yet today
I find my love has flown 
I am without my love

Now laughing friends deride
Tears I cannot hide
So I smile and say
When a lovely flame dies

And I gayly laughed
that they would doubt my love
yet today
I find my love has flown 
I am without my love

Tears I cannot hide
So I smile and say
When a lovely flame dies
love will leave you
crying in your sleep
once you're in too deep
love will leave lost and lonely
love will break your heart

love will make you fall apart 
the moment that you stop belonging
nothing ends the pain
tearing you away
wondering where you made your big mistake

Wishing on a star
promises go far
now, she's gone
never in my wishing did I think of love's pain
now, i'll have to think again
my happy ever ending is for someone else.

It’s morning I have to go
Though every night pretends
Begins in quiet hoping that it never ends

They’re always ending again
Breaking another dream
A dream where we could breathe
In the heavy curtained Prairie air of summer night

Watching lightning over wheat fields
Through a bedroom window
And the prairie gently rose up
With a feeling and embraced us

And when morning found us
I pulled you to me and promised to stay
But that was the night and now day

In the wee small hours of the morning
While the whole wide world is fast asleep
You lie awake and think about the girl
And never ever think of counting sheep

And when your lonely heart has learned its lesson
You’d be hers if only she would call
For in the wee small hours of the morning
That’s the time you miss her most of all

Her name is June
She's a solid piece of work

Brought up in a shitty little town
Which stays unknown
Still she misses home

She's done it well on her own

Here she comes
She won't be brushed aside, oh, no
Here she comes
You'll know it's her
Here she comes
Here she comes

While you've been sleepin' she been up
Since I don't know when
Never waste her time

Once she sets herself a goal
She switches mode
You'd better be on her side

You'd better be careful!

Here she comes
She won't be brushed aside, oh,no
Here she comes
You'll know it's her
You'll know for sure
Here she comes

And her voices lead her on
Embrace the shadows, enjoy the sun
She's bright
She's the one!

Thought I heard you talking softly.
I turned on the lights, the TV and the radio
Still I can't escape the ghost of you

What has happened to it all?
Crazy, some'd say,
Where is the life that I recognize?
Gone away

But I won't cry for yesterday, there's an ordinary world,
Somehow I have to find.
And as I try to make my way, to the ordinary world
I will learn to survive.

Passion or coincidence once prompted you to say
""Pride will tear us both apart""
Well now pride's gone out the window cross the rooftops, run away,
Left me in the vacuum of my heart.

What is happening to me?
Crazy, some'd say,
Where is my friend when I need you most?
Gone away

But I won't cry for yesterday, there's an ordinary world,
Somehow I have to find.
And as I try to make my way, to the ordinary world
I will learn to survive.

Papers in the roadside tell of suffering and greed
Feared today, forgot tomorrow
Ooh, here besides the news of holy war and holy need
Ours is just a little sorrowed talk

(Just blown away)

And I don't
But I won't cry for yesterday, there's an ordinary world,
Somehow I have to find.
And as I try to make my way, to the ordinary world

Never get wise on music, just let it go 
You sing the song if it makes you grow

All in all, wherever you go 
There is always someone listening

That David played and it pleased the lord
But you don't really care for music do ya
Well it goes like this the fourth the fifth
The minor fall and the major lift
The baffled king composing hallelujah

Hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah

Well your faith was strong but you needed proof
You saw her bathing on the roof
Her beauty and the moonlight overthrew you

She tied you to a kitchen chair
She broke your throne and she cut your hair
And from your lips she drew the hallelujah.

Hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah

Well maybe there's a god above
But all I've ever learned from love
Was how to shoot somebody who outdrew you
And it's not a cry that you hear at night
It's not somebody who's seen the light
It's a cold and it's a broken hallelujah

Kurt Nilsen,"I come from down in the valley 
Where mister when you're young 
They bring you up to do like your daddy done 
Me and Mary we met in high school 
When she was just seventeen 
We'd ride out of this valley down to where the fields were green 

We'd go down to the river 
And into the river we'd dive 
Oh down to the river we'd ride 

Then I got Mary pregnant 
And man that was all she wrote 
And for my nineteenth birthday I got a union card and a wedding coat 
We went down to the courthouse 
And the judge put it all to rest 
No wedding day smiles no walk down the aisle 
No flowers no wedding dress 

That night we went down to the river 
And into the river we'd dive 
Oh down to the river we did ride 

I got a job working construction for the Johnstown Company 
But lately there ain't been much work on account of the economy 
Now all them things that seemed so important 
Well mister they vanished right into the air 
Now I just act like I don't remember 
Mary acts like she don't care 

But I remember us riding in my brother's car 
Her body tan and wet down at the reservoir 
At night on them banks I'd lie awake 
And pull her close just to feel each breath she'd take 
Now those memories come back to haunt me 
They haunt me like a curse 
Is a dream a lie if it don't come true 
Or is it something worse 
That sends me down to the river 
Though I know the river is dry 
That sends me down to the river tonight

Pacing this floor another dozen times
If there was some way to express it otherwise, I would
Fed up on fighting over crumbs and dust
Don't have to be this way, a hollow trust
If we could find some way to make it right, we would, we would

And then the silence came, there was not a word to say
One hour felt like a day when the silence came
We felt it on our bodies, no way to turn it around
One hour felt like a day when the silence came

Can't hear nothing but the dripping from the town
Blowing kisses, no one to grab
Need to organize this life that we have, if we could

God knows what we have sacrificed
Guess we deserve the days of our lives
Wish we could learn how to let things slide away, just for a day

And then the silence came, there was not a word to say
One hour felt like a day when the silence came
We felt it on our bodies, no way to turn it around
One hour felt like a day when the silence came

God knows what we have sacrificed
Guess we deserve the days of our lives
Wish we could learn how to let things slide for a day

There's nothing I can do about it

Come again, come again
What was that you said?
Come again, come again
C-c-come on down
Could use a little help comin' around, whoo

Autumn come and winter go
And spring sprayed all over, all we know
Then summer come in raging, brought my blood right to a boil
Then even the heat too turned around and went
But it was a long one

Come again
What was that you said?
Come again, come again
C-c-come on down a while
The world had better come around

Come again, come again
Come again, yeah
Come again

Whoo

Mm, don't you know I really love you now?

Stop this plane 'cause I wanna get off
Pull over somewhere on the side of a cloud
Watch me get out 
And watch me go, down

Kurt Vile,"Back is achin' but I cannot sleep
'Cause I want to be like I am the mayor of some godforsaken town
Sure, they knighted me yesterday
But who needs armor when I have an exoskeleton?
I slip and squirm through the cracks
Creep around by the- all the loading zones in my dirty little town
Get my shoppin' done, laundry too
Drop some dead weight, clean my hands of what I need to clean my hands of
And all for free by mayoral decree
All from zone to loading zone of my town, yeah

Three grumpy girls and a dyin' daddy
But oh-so gorgeous the way they crave
How beautiful to take a bite out of the world
I want to rip the world a new one
It just crawls out of my mouth anymore
You can hate on it or you can hug it
You can get all mushy and lovey-dovey
It's all the same when I'm out there drivin' around
All from zone to loading zone of my beautiful town

I park for free
One stop shop life for the quick fix
Before you get a ticket
That's the way I live my life
I park for free

I park for free

?, shit

Yeah
Loved you all a long, long while
Looked down into a deep, dark well
Called all your names
They echoed down for miles and miles
And all that other mystical, well, never-you-mind

Loved them all through many a lifetime
Some are gone but some still strong
Some are weird as hell but we love 'em
Some are one trick ponies but we embrace 'em
'Cause I've always had a soft spot for repetition

Wooh, loved you all a long, long while
Looked down into a deep, dark well
Called all your names
They echoed down for miles and miles
And all that other mystical, well, never-you-mind

Loved you all a long, long time
Looked long into the length of a tunnel
Called all your names
And we was tripping out 'cause we needed a way out
And all them other crystalline mystic rationalizations

Loved them all right down to my soul
Looked well into the depth of a hole
Pondered perpetual motion in the echo
Just like the song if the repeats were long

Loved you all a long, long while
Looked down into a deep, dark well
Called all your names
They echoed down for miles and miles
And all that other mystical, well, never-you-mind

Loved you all a long, long while
And I'd give my left, nevermind, for one big synchronized smile
Some are one trick ponies but so am I
Round 'em up into a mixed bag bundle of love now, yeah

Loved them all a long, long tick
And it's four, five, six
Prevent your schtick
Throw them at the wall in a mixed bag and see if they stick
Then give 'em a glass of water
Give 'em a cherry pie

Kurt Vile,"How's it goin'?

Once was a thought inside my head
'Fore I reached thirty I'd be dead
But somehow on and on I go
I keep on rollin' with the flow

Folks said that I would change my mind
I'd straighten up and do just fine
Aw, but I still love rock and roll
I keep on rollin' with the flow

All guys my age are raising kids
I'm raisin' hell just like I did
I've got a lot of crazy friends
They forgive me of my sins

Some might be callin' me a bum
But I'm still out there havin' fun
And Jesus loves me, yes, I know
So, I keep on rollin' with the flow
(Keep on rollin', keep on)
(Keep on rollin')

All guys my age are raising kids
I'm raisin' hell just like I did
I've got a lot of crazy friends
They forgive me of my sins

Can't take it with you when you're gone
But I want enough to get there on
And I ain't never growin' old
So, I keep on rollin' with the flow
I ain't ever growin' old
If I keep on rollin' with the flow
Keep on rollin', keep on rollin'
