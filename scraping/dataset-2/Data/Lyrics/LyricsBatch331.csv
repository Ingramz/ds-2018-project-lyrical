Greyarea,"How many times can I say I'm sorry? 
I don't mean to bring you down 
How many times can I say the wrong things? 
I'll just slow down and give you time, 
I don't mean to bring you down 
How many times can I say the wrong things? 
You know that I care, and I mean it for always 
I look at you, I've run you down. 
I remember when your smile was so natural 
There's something wrong and I know that it's me. 
So listen to these words that you hear so seldom 
I didn't mean for it to come to this. 
Because without you around, I'm next to nothing 
I didn't mean for it to come to this.",Reminder,2000
Greyarea,"You must have made up your mind some time ago. 
The problems you were facing, something I'll never know. 
You made a choice that put an end to you, 
I guess it's what you thought you had to do. 
Made a choice for your own good and now I wonder if I would. 
Now I'm angry and I'm hurt, you left us all behind. 
Are you laughing now because we're still in this life? 
And I know it's unbelievable, it wasn't time for you to die. 
We used to share a smile, for me to get through this, 
It's going to have to take a while. 
I look up at the sky, and I see a star, 
I knew that you'd go far and now we reach the end, 
Now I'm missing you my friend.",Silence,2001
Greyboy,"To know you, is to love you,but to know me, is not that way you see
'Cause you make me, so happy,that my love for you grows intensely
When I'm down and feelin' sad,you always comfort me

Greyhound,"Moon River, wider than a mile,
I'm crossin' you in style someday. 
Old dream maker, you heartbreaker, 
Wherever you're goin', I'm goin'your way. 

Two drifters, off to see the world. 
There's such a lot of world to see. 
We're after the same rainbow's end, 
Waitin' round the bend, 
My huckleberry friend, 
Moon River and me.",Moon River,1988
Greyhound,"I am what I am, yes, I'm one of the people
I scheme and I dream and I try
I am what I am, yes, I'm one of the people
I'm happy to live 'til I die
I'm happy to live 'til I die

I can look at the world with the most understanding
From my tenement flat on the second landing
It's been raining today but I really don't care
I've got sun in my heart and a daydream to share
Yes, I have

I am what I am, yes, I'm one of the people
I scheme and I dream and I try
I am what I am, yes, I'm one of the people
I'm happy to live 'til I die
I'm happy to live 'til I die

I believe in the end when the roll call's taken 
We'll be laughing together without hesitation
I've been known by some to be a dreamer of sorts
But I'll follow the road and I'm happy of course
Yes, I am

I am what I am, yes, I'm one of the people
I scheme and I dream and I try
I am what I am, yes I'm one of the people
I'm happy to live 'til I die

I've been happy, I've been sad
Sometimes good, sometimes bad

Greyhound,"Every night I hope and pray
A dream lover will come my way
A girl to hold in my arms
And know the magic of her charms
'Cause I want
A girl
To call
My own
I want a dream lover
So I don't have to dream alone

Dream lover, where are you
With a love, oh, so true
And the hand that I can hold
To feel you near as I grow old
'Cause I want
A girl
To call
My own
I want a dream lover
So I don't have to dream alone

Someday, I don't know how
I hope she'll hear my plea
Some way, I don't know how
She'll bring her love to me

Dream lover, until then
I'll go to sleep and dream again
That's the only thing to do
Till all my lover's dreams come true
'Cause I want
A girl
To call
My own
I want a dream lover

Greyhound,"She's not just another woman
She's not no, no
She's not just another woman
She's not no, no

She's given me a new born birth
I found sweetness on this bitter earth
She knows the things to say
To help my troubles away

And when the words she say won't do
She'll try a kiss or two
And if her kisses fail to move me
She'll take a little time to soothe me

She's mine, mine, mine
She knows how to console me
She's mine, mine, mine
She knows how to control me

I don't want nobody talking 'bout my baby
Nobody talkin' 'bout my baby
I never thought I'd find another
Who gave me more love than my own mother

She's not just another woman
She's not no, no
She's not just another woman
She's not no, no

She taught me the meaning of giving
She brought me back from the dead to the living
From a one room dirty shack
She washed the clothes on my back

She's got electrifying lovin'
As warm as a mother's oven
Don't know where she gets the power
Her lovin' gets strong by the hour

She's mine, mine, mine
She knows how to console me
She's mine, mine, mine
She knows how to control me

Listen she's not just another woman
She's not no, no
She's not just another woman
She's not no, no

She's give me a new born birth
I found sweetness on this bitter earth
She's been just as close as a sister or a brother

She's done things for me
I couldn't ask of my own father
I believe her love would stretch
From one end of this earth to the other
Let me tell you she's not just another woman",Black and White,2002

Greyhound,"I was born and raised down in Alabama
On a farm way back up in the woods
I was so ragged the kids would call me patches
Papa used to kid me about it
Of course deep down inside
He was thinkin' he had done all he could do
My papa was a great old man
I can see him with a shovel in his hand
See, education he never had
But he did wonders when the time got bad
A little money from the crops he raised
Barely paid the bills we made
Oh life had kicked him down to the plow
When he tried to get up life would kick him back down
One day papa called me to his dyin' bed
Put his hands on my shoulders And in tears he said
Patches, I'm depending on you son
To pull the family through My son, it's all left up to you

Two days later papa passed away
I became a man that day
So I told mama I was gonna quit school
But she said that was dad's strictest rule
So every morning 'fore I went to school
I fed the chickens and I chopped wood too
Sometimes I felt that I couldn't go on
I wanted to leave this but I wanted a home
But I always remembered what my daddy said
With tears in his eyes on his dyin' bed
He said, ""Patches, I'm depending on you son
I tried to do my best, It's up to you to do the rest
:
But then one day a strong rain came
And washed all the crops away
And at the age of thirteen I thought I was carrying
The weight of the whole world on my shoulders
And you know, mama knew what I was going through, Cause
Everyday I had to work the fields
Cause that's the only way we got our meals
You see, I was the oldest of a family
And everybody else depended on me
Every night I heard my mama pray
Lord, give him the strength to face another day
Though years have passed and all the kids are gone
I aimed to take my mama to a brand new home
God knows people that I shed a tear
My daddy's voice helped me through the years
Sayin', ""Patches, I'm depending on you son
To pull the family through My son, it's all left up to you
I could still hear papa when he'd say
Patches, I'm depending on you son
I tried to do my best It's up to you to do the rest"".",Patches,2003

Living inside the box
You're so afraid of taking chances,
How you gonna reach the top?

No it don't come fast.

Lock me up inside your garden.

Moving slow, to the sadness.

These nights are a little bit colder
Now that you're gone
My skies seem a little bit darker
Sweet dreams seem a little bit harder

With both my feet grazing the water
I could taste the island beaches on my tongue
Splashes on the rocks

Got me imagining the palm trees
And the shorelines spotted up with coconuts
Tidal waves and hurricanes
Broken anchors, crashing planes

Keep washing me up on your sand
Take my hand
I wanna be stranded on this island with you
I wanna be stranded on this island for two

And I hope it's somewhere far
Where only we are
Stranded on your heart
Spend my free time thinking

How your tears aren't made for drinking
But I'm thirsty for what you're keeping inside
Losing track of time what seems like weeks
Is only hours

I can't wait until that moment when you're mine
Even though we're not the same
Different in every way
I can't help but smile when you say

Take my hand
I wanna be stranded on this island with you

Look at the sun and see the clouds turn to faces in the sky
We've been awake all night, shattered dreams all around
Close your sad, sad eyes we will be safe and sound

Come with me for a little ride, see the shadows passing by
Look at the sun and see the clouds turn to faces in the sky
Daydreaming lightly through the rain
All's forgiven on a summer train

Come with me for a little ride, see the shadows passing by
Seems we are a thousand miles away from last night
As you sigh in my ear, kiss the rain goodbye

Come with me for a little ride, see the shadows passing by
Look at the sun and see the clouds turn to faces in the sky
Daydreaming lightly through the rain
All's forgiven on a summer train

Come with me for a little ride, see the shadows passing by
Come away with me, it's gonna be all right just breathe
Come away with me, it's gonna be all right you'll see

And the windows are crying, but this train is flying us all through the rain, I fear
And the sky is getting brighter with every mile
And it all seems clear

Come with me for a little ride, see the shadows passing by
Look at the sun and see the clouds turn to faces in the sky
Daydreaming lightly through the rain
All's forgiven on a summer train

Come with me for a little ride, see the shadows passing by
Come away with me, it's gonna be all right just breathe
Come away with me, it's gonna be all right you'll see

Not much left for me to run from now
Guess I'll turn myself around
I'm putting down my defenses
These wings are gonna take me off the ground
It's freedom sweet as sound
And I'll admit that I was wrong
It's freedoms beautiful sound

Could you stop and take a look at me now?

Your looking at the positive that was negative
Would you stop and take a look at me now?

Not sure where I want to go tonight
Isn't that what life's about?
So long for the fears and worries
Let's go and you won't be sorry
I'll be the one that gets you out
Chase the demons out tonight
You can see how fast they run
When you turn the lights will shine

Would you stop and take a look at me now?
Could you stop and take a look at me now?
When your standing right in front of me
Your looking at the positive that was negative
Would you stop and take a look at me now?

And it gets more beautiful it gets more beautiful
As the sun turns into rain
And the hurt turns into shame
And it gets more wonderful it gets more wonderful

That you can not lose again?

How long can we go until we're nothing but a pile of bones?

And look at what you brought me, girl
Nothing but pain.
Spending my money for a walk in the rain, I'm drained.
And never wanted this to be the outcome.
When I can ever trust you and all I get is, how come?
Why, after everything I gave you can share it with a stranger every time I went away.
I've been lied to before girl,
I see it in your face that you don't care about the broken heart I taste.

Sunny, yesterday my life was filled with rain
Sunny, you smiled at me and really eased the pain
Now the dark days are gone and the bright days are here and my sunny side shines

Come on man, not your same old shit
I’ve been living steady wobbling on the edge
Chasing life around in circles trying to decompress my head
I feel it get intense, choose to break my bread and spread it around
Take my every single thought into this pen and jot it down
'Cause it’s the truth to me, you should see
It’s all that ever helped
Held my shattered world together when I knocked it off the shelf into the blackness
Tripping over broken hearts and homes and getting close enough to turn that kid inside of me to stone
And I’ll admit it, cause I was never taught to give it up
Sailed an ocean full of drug addicted misincouraged blood
Without a paddle
It took a lot of faith to fight my battles and tackle a couple of habits I never thought that
I’d have to
But did, bottle the water under the bridge and toss another written page of my history to the wind
When it blows, cause all of this disaster has lead me home and left a lot of room for me to learn to grow
Yeah you are not alone

Grab hold of yourself, I know what it’s like to get blown away
I know you, that
You’ve done your dirt and you’ve dug your graves and it feels like it won’t be saved
I say grab hold yourself and face those days when you feel like it always rains
I’ve seen the sunny side of hell, that which I never
Thought I’d find for myself
Never thought I’d find for myself

Not your same old song
I’ve been writing on a mirror with a razor blade
And chased away the devil in my brain that played me like a spade
Cause day today, painted jaded faith issues a shade of gray
And cowered, hid behind emotion just to pay it safe
A pawn, slowly turning victim to my wrongs
I had to wake up all alone to finally figure out my wants
In the house of haunted love the past will keep me warned and explain me
Even if you’re listening through the storm
I found a purpose and if you heard this then sit it down
Pick its brain until it opens up and redirects the sound
The conductor, frozen thunder rumbling through the ground
With a perfect little twist of that suit of armor
And crown
You created, built for denying it
Hiding the cuts and bruises due to the self-inflicted bone crushing anxiety
I’m with you, so understand that all of this within you
Has chiselled you a flower out of stone
Yeah you are not alone

Grab hold of yourself, I know what it’s like to get blown away
I know you, that
You’ve done your dirt and you’ve dug your graves and it feels like it won’t be saved

The other eye on my drink

Got my hands tied up still climbing this tree
So can't none judge what my crisis might be
Everything will even out when I finally sleep
Tipsy dreaming about being a pirate at sea
Huh, I hear the sirens singing for someone else to listen
Got me thinking I avoided a bullet
But a lot of my vision was under blurry conditions
I watched from the top of a volcano of bullshit
Which came first, the thirst or the curse?
Most can't distinguish which one is worse

It show a basketball game with the volume off

I'm lost, wrote my room number on the fob
Put a dollar in the jukebox, ordered up a shot
Now everything is frozen just floating flickering dots
As we fade into the night without ever giving it thought
But that's the idea, we don't come for the atmosphere
The food's shitty, the cable's blurred but I'm happy here
We're all alone but ain't nobody keeping tabs there
'Cause misery's a meal that's served better with a glass of beer
Yeah, so fill it up and let me sulk
Smelling like whiskey and complimentary soap
It's the same four bars in every city I go

It's a dog eat dog world, and that ain't no lie.

Making love by candlelight,

And drink some more wine,

From powder to pine I got money on my mind
Stop wasting all my time and get me over to the spot
Unload all the cargo and meet me at the docks

Felt all up in they pockets rocking fo' niggas that try to kill us
Then maybe later you bitches bother me 
You wanted to pay you too late don't bother calling me

And in the back of the caddy got fifty pound of smally
Tryed to jack but can't catch me
I just keep that paper stacking
Always packin never slacking

By another little boy and this is what he said
Check it ""Me and you kid we gonna make some cash (What! What!)
Robbin old folks and makin' a (Come on! Come on!) dash...""
Their jackets tied, money came with ease
But one couldn't stop, it's like he had a disease
He robbed another (Stick it up!) and another (Stick it up!) Michael Jackson (Stick it up!) Stevie Wonder (Stick it up!)
Tried to rob a man who was a D.C. undercover
The kid got wild startin' actin' erratic
He said ""I Got you all in check""

Come on!
Yah Yah Yah Yah Yah!
Come on!
Yah Yah Yah Yah Yah!
Come on!
Yah Yah Yah Yah Yah!
Come on!
Yah Yah Yah Yah Yah!
Come on!

When I step up in the place and yo I step correct
WOO-HAH!! Got you all in check
I got that head nod shit that make you break your neck
WOO-HAH!! Got you all in check
Well you know we come through to wreck the disco tech
WOO-HAH!! Got you all in check
Throw your hands up in the air and never disrespect
WOO-HAH!! Got you all in check

Yo grimm
What's up?
Which muthafucka stole (Ha! Ha!) my flow?
Eenie, meenie, minie, moe
Throw them types of niggas right out the win-dow
Blast your ass, hit you with a di-rect blow!
BLAH!! Comin through like G.I. Joe
Star Wars movie deal like Han So-lo
Make you bounce around like this was calyp-so
Always shine cause I got the high pro glow
You think that you can hide, you think you can lay low?
Roll up on your ass like Hawaii 5-0
Mad out, with my dreads in my Kang-lo
Forget that Moet nigga, just bash the Cisco!
Yo! Take a trip down to Mexico
Come back with that shit that might make you psycho
Maximum frequency through that stereo
Sorry this is it but homeboy, I gots (Say what?) ta go!

Yo, where you go? Where you at? Bring it back!
Big props to all my people on the hip-hop scene who going
Fast than me with abrushima my inspiration from youth
Killa bee got loose, don't be teared, don't be mad, no, give it the truth, say

M-E-T-H-O-D, Man (x4)

Break yourself nigga!
Hey you! Get off my cloud
Let me get raw with my southpaw style
Mover, puffin on a fat blunt from Cuba
It's the Meth-Tical jet to Cal, I'm the Buddha
Monk on the hunt for machine gun foes
I keeps you open like a slug from the shotgun punk
Double-barrel, yeah Meth bring it to them proper
Partner, you ain't got no wins in me casa
Straight up, you movin too fast so baby wait up
Took one, added seven more now you eight up
Get on down with your bad self
Get on down, listen to the sound, come on!
Few can ever get this whole commit legit
See you all up in my dick
But you don't know shit, uh-huh
What's your definition of a real MC?
From what you dedicated, ya it must be me
Meth-Tical, a lewd descendant of the loud hip-hop
I go on to the break of dawn and just don't stop
Give me the green light and the sign one way
At last, What you got to say? Come on

Move it in, move it out
Stick it in, pull it out
Shake it up, shake it down
Come on y'all, Meth-Tical
Oh I hope and pray that I will
But today I am still
Just a...

You got g's man please
I'm overseas
I got the beats to keep you blowing on trees
Keep them hoes on they knees
I'm as cold as Mr. Freeze
Making music in this game
Like flipping coke into ki's
Everyday is the same when I'm rolling on chop
Got a cop on my left so I'm riding non-stop
Till I die
I'ma win 
See it's time to make ends
Thinking bout how I'ma make it so I'm sitting on rims
20 inches on chop
Hit the scene on the lean
Burban clean
6 screens
Biscuit tucked at the seams
Make my dreams so real
Plot to make a mil
Let these haters know the way a player really fells
When I'm rollin' g
Shit!
I'm never gonna quit
Bout to hit the switch
So I can dip on the strip
Pull in sideways than I cock it on 3
Everybody stop and stare cause they all want to see how we

[Chorus: SPM (Shadow)]
(I'm rollin')
(Rollin on chop)
(I'm bout to drop the top)
(I'm fresh off the lot)
(I'm rollin')
(Rollin on chop)
17 in a 7 7 Seville
(I'm rollin')
(Rollin on chop)
(I'm bout to drop the top)

Than front to back
Fresh off the lot in my Cadillac

[SPM]
Done hit this spot Grimm
Where we goin' next?

[Grimm]
Let's flip to the club and try to find some sex
See when I'm rollin' in my ride
With my homie on my side
Got 2 sweets rolled 
And I'm bout to touch the sky
High so high
Like my boy Carlos Coy

[SPM]
Maan!

[Grimm]
I'ma Dope House soulja that's self employed

[SPM]
Ya saves quien soy
More chips than Ahoy
Dime lo que quieras
De le doy
In a 100.000 dolla toy
En tontes ya me voy
Take the pain with the joy 
While I bang Pink Floyd
Ship em out the box
Sip Henn on the rocks
I bought 2 clubs and 3 restaurants
My Cadillac hops
I'm strong as an ox
I'ma fly by
And chunk deuce at the cop
Cause I'm

[Verse 3: Lil Bing]
I'm rollin' non stop
I done wrecked the block
Chop chop
Bunny hop
Trunks pop
Tops drop
Got buys by the fly
Got rocks in my watch
I'm sideways on mine
Finna hit the Marriot
I done dodged the cops
I broke em off by the lot
Glock 17 shots
When I punch in the clock
Switching lanes on the main
Crunk the bang when I feel
Wood grain wood strips
Bezatines smoking dip
On the interstate
As I hit the pancake
Sipping on the 8
Straight as I break my scrape plate
Keep my ride up to date
Flipping 20's when I say
""It's that throwed ese on the grind movin weight""
Pull out the shades
Shining down my blades
Today's a sunny day
And there's money to be made
It's that 7 1 trey
Pulling out the Escalade
Creased up with them dames
And a bald fade

Grimm,"I got too many things, going on
And not enough people who love me
I got to deal with it all, right or wrong
And nobody thinking of me

I got too many things, going on
And not enough people who love me
I got to deal with it all, right or wrong
And nobody thinking of me

My lifestyle so cold, holla for the gold
Some say I'm too drunk, some say I'm too blowed
Hold the kilos, and watch the weeds grow
And stacking see-note, on top of see-note
And ooh, my mama love me but found a new man
Took all that she should take, five years I'm still praying
Damn it's out of hand, balling out of control
I love the fame and the fortune, but I sold my soul
Bring it back Lord, help me bring it back, help me
Straighten out my act, all I know is making money slanging yack
On the track, and smoking fat sacks with my mistress
What is this, my life as a misfit

I got too many things, going on
And not enough people who love me
I got to deal with it all, right or wrong
And nobody thinking of me

I got too many things, going on
And not enough people who love me
I got to deal with it all, right or wrong
And nobody thinking of me

Now I don't know what you done heard
Anywhere you go, one do love herb
Like two little birds, kissing in the trees
An angel up above, been whispering to me
Said I'm living in a dream, and it isn't what it seems
Once wanted fame, now I wish it wasn't me
You know, I got a fly groove, so many time zones
Quick to get my rhyme on, listen to it when I'm gone
I was born, to put the boogie in your shoes
Hit the doobie when you through, pass it to me on the cool
I'm a fool for the flipping, spit for those who love me
Thought I knew the game, but it ain't so funny

I got too many things, going on
And not enough people who love me
I got to deal with it all, right or wrong
And nobody thinking of me

I got too many things, going on
And not enough people who love me
I got to deal with it all, right or wrong
And nobody thinking of me

Come on now, help me get up out of the rain
I'm blessed with the joy, but cursed with the pain
Come on now, everybody knowing my name
Ask Little Ronny, can you spare some change
See I'm tired of the game, tired of the lies
Now all I want to do is keep my eyes on the prize
Rise to the occasion, interrogation is my persuasion
To do the things I do, keep the average head aching
Waking up at noon, listen to the tune
I'm dedicated to my first love, back in high school
Went from close pin to kingpin, every weekend
Shining like a star, but far from what I'm seeking

I got too many things, going on
And not enough people who love me
I got to deal with it all, right or wrong
And nobody thinking of me

Another day when I'm waking up 
I turn my TV on CNN 
Another homie done bit the dust, my best friend's back up in the pen 
Somebody hit the twin towers,and the buildings came tumbling down 
All we could do was watch in tears 
While the people of America wondered how we let it go down 
Then, I heard a sound when I turned around 
This old man said pray for me 
Said I've been in the world for 88 long years and go now can you stay for me? 
I looked him in the eyes, and gave him a smile and said mister I don't mean no harm 
But you ain't going nowhere, so just pull up a chair 
I got greens fresh off the farm 
And with that he pulled a bottle from his pocket and said youngin' ima give it a try 
I said hold up pops, I ain't forget about the nana you promised so pass it by 
And then he said

Sometimes I want to get away from all the confusion

I know you wish you could run away from this institution

From dusk to dawn, mom's always tellin' me you must move on 
Let the past be the last thing to dust you son 
And I trust you mom 
But the doesn't mean my lust for fun, want to bust my gun 
Wasn't much to some, then you measured up to most started walking down the road 
To the treasure up the post 
You just never fucking know what you gonna see, where ya gonna be, who you gonna meet 
It's true you gonna sleepin', slip into silence

Spotlight shinin', flashin' on the glance 
At a boy without a chance and the Devil on his ass

I be sayin' though, chasin' the dreams
I be sayin' though same thing that will make you laugh will make you cry 
That's how we know man, why that's why

I be sayin though teach me to use my imagination

She don't be messing with them suckas 
Looking so good, little tight jeans on and G-string on 
And I know that she be feeling me 

She in love with a hustla', someone she could trust uh 
Someone she could get down with, cause she don't mess with suckas 
Sleep all day, and grind all night 
Living in the fast lane, the game's nothing polite 
So I'm laced up tight, cause I ain't into lagging 
She love to watch me in the mirror when I'm doing my stabbing 
And she ain't into punks, giving em bruises and bumps 
And she know I blow big, so she be twisting my blunts 
That's real talk, coming from a real hog on the block 
She love the playboy lifestyle, the knots and the rocks 
And even though sometime, it might seem strange 
She wouldn't trade it in, with none of she thangs

Well now she might of caught my ass like once or twice 
But she'd rather stick with me, instead of rolling the dice 
Cause she know I'm official, so why take a chance 
And end up with a over jealous sucka' romance 
Love to see me get the lap dance every now and then huh 
Never fuck around with her stripper girlfriends huh 
Now that's living like, who's the boss 
Yeah she liking the money, but she loving my sauce 
Even though she approached by them big time ballas 
She ain't having that cause ain't another like papa 
And her parents just don't understand
What kind of man she in love with, 
But she don't give a damn

I know you wish you could run away from this institution 
'Cause there's no solution, to survive 

Another day when I'm waking up 
I turn my TV on CNN 
Another homie done bit the dust, my best friend's back up in the pen 
Somebody hit the twin towers,and the buildings came tumbling down 
All we could do was watch in tears 
While the people of America wondered how we let it go down 
Then, I heard a sound when I turned around 
This old man said pray for me 
Said I've been in the world for 88 long years and go now can you stay for me? 
I looked him in the eyes, and gave him a smile and said mister I don't mean no harm 
But you ain't going nowhere, so just pull up a chair 
I got greens fresh off the farm 
And with that he pulled a bottle from his pocket and said youngin' ima give it a try 
I said hold up pops, I ain't forget about the nana you promised so pass it by 
And then he said

Sometimes I want to get away from all the confusion 
Causin' pollution 
I know you wish you could run away from this institution 
'Cause there's no solution, to survive 

From dusk to dawn, mom's always tellin' me you must move on 
Let the past be the last thing to dust you son 
And I trust you mom 
But the doesn't mean my lust for fun, want to bust my gun 
Wasn't much to some, then you measured up to most started walking down the road 
To the treasure up the post 
You just never fucking know what you gonna see, where ya gonna be, who you gonna meet 
It's true you gonna sleepin', slip into silence 
Shot guns fired, choppers and sirens 
Spotlight shinin', flashin' on the glance 
At a boy without a chance and the Devil on his ass 

I be sayin' though, livin' my life, wishin' and hopin'
I be sayin' though, chasin' the dreams
I be sayin' though same thing that will make you laugh will make you cry 
That's how we know man, why that's why 

I be sayin though taken away from the frustration 
I be sayin though teach me to use my imagination 
I be sayin though same thing that will make you laugh will make you cry 
That's how we know man, why that's why

In order for us to make this thing work, man
We've got to get rid of the pimps, and the pushers, and the prostitutes?)

Yes, yes, y'all

Ah, ah
That's funky

Yeah
Hey yo, Marley, man

Yo, what's up, man?

Hey yo, man
You know
We was getting busy on the album everyday
We been getting funky, but
I wanna take this jam back to Farmers
Know I'm saying?

Yo, let's go back on Farmers
And get some of them early MC's
You used to be kicking it with back in the day?

Yeah, yeah, yeah

Yo, let's do a jam with them

Alright, bet
But first I gotta like introduce it
You know'm sayin?

Aight, kick it

(Farmers Boulevard)

Back in the days, before I was Cool J
I used to hang up on the corner, pumpin' Games People Play
Sittin' on a garbage can, rhymin' to my man
Talkin' bout big money and future plans
I always told the brothers, if I got a contract
When the money started flowin', I'd be back
To do a jam, against all odds
Introducing rapper 1 from Farmers Boulevard

Hey yo, B-o-m-b, bomb explosion
Attack like a cat when I'm trapped and I'm closed in
Sharp-ass claws, and I break all laws
In a while all jaws, cause I'm perfect, no flaws
Now I'm back to Farmers on some new improved
I'm makin' moves, not fakin' moves
So don't you never come around here, talkin' that talk
Or walkin' that walk, you'll get played like a sport
Football, soccer, whatever you savor
You're a tramp and a pussycat, ready for labor
Ha! I'll have you breakin locks
I'll have you cookin fried rice in a big steel box
The type of skills that I got reigned for years
No worry or cares, your crew'll shed tears
'Hip-hip-hooray, he's back!' Yo, save the cheers
Suckers, I'm drinkin' forties of beers
On the Boulevard

Funky, funky, funky rhymes bein said here

Hey yo, hey yo
Hey yo Uncle L, let's go

Yeah man, I wanna check out my man Big Money Grip
Yo, what's up, man
Kick a little something

Kick out the can and slam
Summertime, C.I.A. step into the jam
Reach for the mic, and the punks start to fold up
And the brothers start fleeing like it's a hold-up
Some step aside, but a few play me close
Never worry, cause the brother who cross me's getting buried
And the fool who wants to deal with another dose
I see to it in a hour that the mother is comatose
Farmers Boulevard, the place
Handing me a mic is like giving a chainsaw to Leather face
Smoking MC's in an instant
At my side busting caps is T-Boogie, my assistant
Throw that speaker in the trash
Why's that? Cause Gangster Boogie gave the woofer a gash
Big Money Grip making you get up
Farmers Crew's in effect, we never heard of a head-up

Yo, yo, yo
It's kinda funky out here on the boulevard, yo

Yeah, we living Chinese people in a Turkish bath, baby

Hi C over there, man

Yo, what's up Hi C

Hi C on the scene, at last to bust a funky rhyme
More than a line on time, because I'm gettin mine
Never underestimate the skill of a great one
The Boulevard Lord, shorts, never take none
Another funky rapper from around the way
Leaving bodies at a party, cause somebody gotta pay
Boy, you been told, put your lips on hold
All you remember is a barrel and a mouth full of gold
Spreading terror on the street like they was in the past
Any punks on the block, yo, never could last
And I never feel sorry for a sucker I gained on
Any slick talker, yo, he's bound to get rained on
At any Farmers party at my side is a Mag
(One time a sucker got ill and went out in a body bag)
Fear will erupt through the heart of another
The Farmers Crew will never fall, that's word to the mother

Yo, yo
It's kinda funky out here
Yo, yo, yo, Hi C
Yo man, y'all kinda funky out here, yo
I was,
Yo, what's up?

9 years ago, man
Youknowmsayin?

Farmers Boulevard, baby

Yo, I was kinda,
I was kinda stagnant to sleep on it
But yo, L
Won't you, won't you sum it all up for the people, aight?

Aight, let me sum this up

Now you heard the brothers speaking bout the street that we're from
Rhymes hitting, beats kicking, you can't get none
F-a-r-m-e-r-s passing the test
Marley Marl in the background doing the rest
Do-re-mi-fa-so-la-ti-do, do-ti-la-so-fa-mi-re-do, kato
Get up out my face before I play you like Play-Doh
I did a jam against all odds
And it was dedicated to Farmers Boulevard

I'm totally gone, I'm in another zone nigga put me on this
We layin' stick, my lyrics is heat
Havin' visions of ritual mirrors inside my sleep - nigga peep
I remember watchin' the news, dead people in jimmy bag
I got a Nine nigga get me mad
And watch me throw up razorblades and get to trippin'
I'm cats and crippin', lickin' is civil like Jack the Ripper
I'm on a mission drippin'-a-fog
An when it sees a million motherfuckers deceased
some of police are brutal hog, I'm actor-baitin'
No hesitation to slice a motherfucker in thirty places
Fuck a case - ain't leavin' traces here to Redder-Dip
I'm aimin' a - automatic find a bitch I'm hangin' up
Protainin' up, boss strangler, better save my mother
Flat packs will end as brothers - the bloody covers
Bloody gloves like Yo-J, AK's my brainwaves
I'll strung a nigga all day to my dear play you won't be comin' back
I put that on my dear pops when I blast a fierce drop
My bloody mask revealin' Jason it's non-stop
The cemetery is what you facin'
My steel shot is smokin' like chainsaws, brains call

Prepare for the night that you never wanted

Hit'cha corner with the lights out, bitch it's on
Duck down wit'cha kids, you know what you did
Motherfuck what your niggas say, watch for the ricochet

Cause when I bust off my gat flings like a roll flair
You now listenin' to - the most hated and most loved at the same time 'cause
Ice nigga what the fuck you want to do about a T
Most'cha bitch niggas can't fuck with me
Cause your chin-chalked talk I can see through
Like you're rollin' in a phat V-12
Bulllshit - pull quick and have your shit cocked or dropped
Keep a spare clip cause sometimes the shots don't stop
It's motherfuckin' game to rap about, shits' for real
Double action, ain't gotta cock back no more
Got you bitch-ass niggas sweatin' like Taibo
Rather lookin', in my face, I'm just checkin' my flow
So, I advise you to keep it in the studio
Your attittude, you don't want to meet me dude
My crews' like a fuckin' wild bunch of escaped beasts
Like scientists, cross cells of apes and G's
All the war - get you battle gear, black fatigues
You talk shit, your crews' catch a casualty, uh!

Heads I be sappin' like the grams I be baggin'
Fightin' women, cut throat and tree smokin'
Violatin', infiltratin', blunt bakin'

Leavin' your crew delirious so you don't take it serious
I'm guessin' you was serious about the West, none test

Got the ball, fuck the law and yep I wet 'em out

Like Lil Flip I can do that, Excursion candy blue tha?
Twenty two that, pounds of dro I done blew that
You should of knew that, the Slim Thug gon' shine
My ear rings cost a dime, I read Rolex Times
I'm top of the line, you can tell when I open my mouth
I bet nobody got mo' princess cut teeth, than the Boss
Open your mouth up you lost, I'm blinding these boys

I'm swanging four's and thinking thoed, banging hoes and changing clothes
Smoking dro and doing shows, paper stack can never fold
I bought the car and I bought the house, I represent the Dirty South
Got more syrup than Waffle House, run through hoes like Marshall Faulk
I talk the talk and walk the walk, 'cause nigga I'm a G

You see them rocks in my teeth, ain't none of em fake
Give me a break, you think I'm lying or something

We throw Crys in the air laugh, and watch it fall
Watch me ball, as the Dub spin like a top
I got crunk when I stopped, and made my pop trunk wop
Girls bop, automatic cause I'm top of the line
I cut my beep past six, and I raise the top of your spine
I'ma shine, Sucka Free, Boss Hogg in a row
You can catch me fresh and braided, or rugged and fro
You see the Spre's on the car, I bet you my people like the rock
When girls see Tite, Flip and Slim they say... pulling cameras out
Damn I'm hot, when I hit the club I'm bound to line to the bar
And for the first hundred people, I'm insuring they car

See the chains bump ends

I got the wrist ware, smooth and sleek
Nothing but ?
You ain't never saw a watch like this so go ahead and take a peek

Blow the spot

Same concept for your flows and hook
See these round here they can raise the dead
So come on everybody now bob your head
Why'all need to heed these words from the wise
Rhymes so meaty like jambalaya
Got truth for hire
Can you stand the fire
To see you come alive that's my desire now

Boy looka here
Have you ever heard a dead man talk before
You ever seen a dead man walk before
You ever heard dead man lock the flow
Like these before
We raised the qou

You knew another record would hit

I keep comin' at you
Lyrical raptures capture you
Only if your soul is ready
I comin' after you
Bodysnatchin' you and dismantlin' your crew
It's Tennesseeans wit nouns and verbs agreein'
Wit higher being
Sendin' messages
Spreadin' through your chest it's just
Blessings from conception rearrangin' your perception
This planetary lyricist
At least that's what the Source quotes
Resurrectin' hip-hop on a higher plateau
We crept low
Movin' slow with intention to blow
Carry loads of flows for those who doubt and didn't know
And circumstances deep in crime intense seat back in the
Center of my body structure
Ready to rupture
At times I sat back to think again and again
How I broke the golden rule by doing business with friends
My mind traveled paths on a search to be free
Suspicion felt corruption had a piece of Gotee
Success had me stressed like the G-Mo-be	
Cee-Lo's verse on ""Thought Process"" was the description of me
But them again I caught the vision that was given within
As a child rockin' mirrors wishin' I was Rakim
On stage
Engagin' state to state
Rampages, airplay, videos, and stretch black limos
The dream that seemed impossible
But now I'm doin' show for thousands
Savin' souls through least
Lacin' spirits concrete
And the belief that I inject on beats
Deplete
God's word that is instilled in me
To the masses 'til I feel my mission here is complete
And it's essential
That this is my life after mental

(Chorus) 2X
Mental's over
It's the dawn of a new day
Out with the old
Different messages to relay
Mental's gone
It's time to do it up again
The past is behind
Life after will begin

[Coffee]
Now let's talk
Gather to see who can talk the most noise on an album
You the listeners decide the outcome
How come
It's our second record without Mental... gettin' the recognition it deserved
This Christian industry is gettin' on my nerve
Serves us right for thinkin' they would believe our vision
Give us proper support
But when it got hectic
Mission abort
Poor sports is what they called us
Now that's crazy
All cause we wanted to be pushed
Not ambushed and pulled
Off the shelves for being ourselves
Unlike no one else
But still they made comparisons
How Un-American
Strivin' in the midst of warzones and red tape
They try to hold us back
But it's the black in me that makes me create
Colorful collages hang on the walls of garages
No mirages
What you see is what you get
Ah, that's that hit
Ah shoots you know I'm in cohoots
With the higher power
Sprinkle me with spirital showers
Drinks anyone
Pourin' glasses of Tang
If you're drinkin' from me, the flavor's lemon meringue
I'ma be me despite the shackles of the industry
Bump they last chances
God engineers my circumstances
And hey
I think I like that
He's the one I confine in
Never dealin' shady and lettin' the enemy slide in
This rap game is all I got to maintain
It keeps me sane in my life
After mental

Show 'em you the realest

My equilibrium is slightly off
I'm a little bit tilted off the loudmouths
In hip hop who claim the built it
Hip hop is a God inspired art form
Correction's my delivery giving proper credit
With no edit to the chivalry

Straight laced straight faced
You can buck it if you want to
Undermining cleverly your twisted schemes
The factors on to bigger and better things

Future shining
Amazing as a ray of light to somebody trapped
In a cave since they freed the slaves
I'm bursting at the seams for a chance to gleam
I'ma show 'em,  I'ma show 'em

I mean it's like this wit; it's simply put
My plagiarism wisdom used in decision making process
Helps me make the kind of choices
I can live with swallow and digest

I rise up like emotions and feelings
Dust in the cracks of ceilings
Healing in the name of Jesus all the achy parts
Landscaping mentally shaking

Unusual fellow
The album's three times dope
Don't hope it's going to be mellow
I'm coming with the force of a county sheriff

Serving subpoenas to a ballooned buffoon
Barbaric with his platoon
Goon squadron
And soon this gone be released
And like Jesus we bring swords not peace

From the middle of the dirty rhyme
Excursion 'cause diversion
Splurging nouns and verbs converted
Phrases phrases from my pages
Ballers call us verbal players

Crumbs to bricks we flip to layers
Stack to cake and serve in prayer
Hopes and dreams we must believe
Dope emcees from birth are these

No need for paper chasing cheese
Blessed with riches heavenly
Daily hate is breedin' jealousy
Using my lifestyle as an album concept

But soon enough the truth reveals
The lies you claim in your rep
'Cause we the realest not in the sense
Of claiming hardest on wax
What you see is what you get

We only hard on them facts
Best believe we the illest
'Cause you bouncing to beat created an illustrated
By some c Christian emcee

My style is universal
School of rhyme university instituting my profession
With lessons through diversity
Could never be pinpointed by beats

'Cause beats could never define one
Who's anointed in speech and likewise spiritually
Through intervention words capture me and rapture me
Minds of blinded individuals close minded
Residuals don't make you and emcee

Just because your budgets big
And your video looks Hollywood
Don't make you better than me
Time is ticking, people changing
Taste the real from fake appeal

I'm from the 'ville
I thought you knew we was titans
Don't clash with Nash
Not on a mission to prove but was commissioned to move
Not for flashy style or Image but because God said it was finished

",Ima Showem,1999
Grits,"The more I meditate, I hesitate to even show face
The more I hesitate, I contemplate my life is a waste
My spirit levitates to take a glance at truth of its grace
As my flesh emulates every act of disgrace

So deceptive in perception of its hunger and greed
Maliciously relentless to fulfill whatever it needs
Undisciplined, rebellious, no regard for righteousness
Ever since it tasted death, he desires nothing less

Too many nights I spent in tears, drowning in fear
I'm never making it, through all the time I spend faking it
My soul is proving capability and prone that when alone
Without the father?s consecration flesh manipulates

Constantly, continual battles might end up being goes through
Why do I do the things I know I'm not supposed to
Why don't I do the things that I know I should do
Who's to blame except me and me alone, I found my enemies home

What could it inhibit a habit the dark corners lurking
Demonic principalities when other evils working
You can't escape fate, allow what's in your heart to tailgate
You're your only cell mate to unlock what locked the jail gate

What could it inhibit a habit the dark corners lurking
Demonic principalities when other evils working
You can't escape fate, allow what's in your heart to tailgate
You're your only cell mate to unlock what locked the jail gate

Somewhere inside the crevice, I long to face the limits
The premise is death for execution of flesh
Past no authority and so control the tree of life
I chose, taking shape of its mold

Indulge in fruit too, whatever you do, I do, we crew
Give it unto a city, evil, not for me, you, you
Doom can't loom if I no longer give it room zoom a zoom
You're free to explode for miles with a loud boom

Perfect tightly I hold with no attention
To foe toe to toe and low to low, flow to flow I stand firm
Learn to discern, circumstances are changed
Do a dance with death, till my soul?s last breath

When I'm at my hardest can salvage my image tarnish
What can make me whole again the blood of Jesus
Freed a deed down the slanted hill I ski high speed
Manage to get bandaged when I got tree

What could it inhibit a habit the dark corners lurking
Demonic principalities when other evils working
You can't escape fate, allow what's in your heart to tailgate
You're your only cell mate to unlock what locked the jail gate

What lies in a man?s soul

I found that evil doesn't have a face, so let alone a place
It just lingers in the void over an open space searching out a victim
To nuzzle up against, take under its wing and habit, then reign supreme
Think it control, it slowly conquers a man?s soul

Behold real TV, even real is when it takes its toll
Unfold, with those punches, you don't have to roll
Toss yourself at the cross, and escape the devil
More vibrant than the radiant redhead

With flashlights, the fingers, the illuminated words of Christ
Put that on ice for a spell, pray tell, how in the world
Do you excel in the glory of God, and then rebel
Letting death valley give you a fear falling down

It will only breed your fears when you allow it to hang around
So get down, hit knees where prayers don't cease
What's lurking probably shouldn't even be working

Doing 90 down hell's highway
Screeching
Despite the lifetime of preaching

Forgive me
I know not what I do
The trials and Tribs of life
Make me come unglued
Crude to be subdued eaten alive like food
Booed
By angry onlookers who I've never seen before

A vocal ville local with a crib in Acapulco
Speakin' faith focal
Time and time again
What I confess is hands raised to the ceiling

Concealed like weapons looking to kill

Walked amongst the dead
Laid to rest in a coffin
Nocturnal destiny
Leading to my eternity
Hourly concerning me
Yet I wasn't yearned
To be all of what
His calling said to be
And bred to be
Actually I thought it was all about me
Took for granted what was handed by the unseen
Invested all my time and effort
Building see
Appealing to my desires
And lustful feelings

I lived life with eyes sown up

Surrounding me within the blackness
Walking cautiously
Only God guiding me
Abiding in me
Independently I fail myself
Images of my history
Is haunting at times
Taunting at times
Confronted most times
How is spent mines
Tempted frequently
To feed the need
Of past relations
Found struggling attaining more scars
Through inner battling
Wondering will I make it
Plundered through ways to shake it
Remembering what was written
My only method
To break it
Being locked in this life
Connected to Christ
His will and my destiny
My reason and purpose for birth in life
For a minute was contended
With whatever was presented
If it's sin
I was in it
In the flesh represented
Suppressing truth in which was hid
In my spirit ignoring guidance
Rebelling against His voice
With choices in pure defiance
Then I asked myself
Was it designed to be mine
If so
I found I wasted the blessing
Of precious time

Mentality of bangbanger
To topple my dopple ganger
With excessive force
No doubting
While re-routing course bouting
What might endorse
Waters of hell, just to prevail
""Don't fail""
The voice saying magically
What tragedy entail
The terror won't take my will
To conquer error
When the time has passed and gone
The ending will be
""Me at home""
I brought it to you plainly

Don't let it pass you by

Whatever it has to offer
Situations come

Whoâ€™d have thought my babe was on an island of her own
Had me smiling on the phone same page different time zones
Godâ€™s a real character painting caricatures of christ
And his love for the church enduring the pain 'cause it hurts
When I saw you I went bezerk insane goin looney and cartooney
So sue me you was a vision of beauty truly
Thinking of all the charm to inflect upon my behalf
Forgive me donâ€™t mean to stare but your hair is down to your calf
Tell me about yourself your culture is polynesian
I love when the breeds be mixin our blueprint is in ephesians
Instantaneously cultures collided decided weâ€™d ride it
Spent time in prayer separately so we wouldnâ€™t have to hide it
Fictitious image brought to life reflection of love
Carefully inspected with gloves so fragile my darling was
And I ain't need miss cleo to re-assure me that I got her
Scored big like the opening week of harry potter

In the beginning I hesitated debated within my soul
Wrestling with my feelings of knowing if you was sent
Enduring the distance alone being content
Longing your presence believing that we was meant
Submitted my intent I was truly convinced
You're the women in my life I couldnâ€™t breathe without
And I wrote this so you wouldnâ€™t have any doubt
Or misunderstanding of what my love is really about
Cause from here on out baby its all about us
And from here on out I want to build on trust
Cause the union we got ain't no comparing any other
I'm askin you to be more than a baby's mother

Beginning and end and better half of life
To be my lady my lover my best friend and wife hey",Be Mine,2002
Grits,"Everybody needs something to see
Something to feel
And something to be
Everybody needs something as proof
Something in hand
To know the truth 

Livin' lavish like the biltmore 
What the blood spilt for
A ship in harbor safe 
But that ain't what its built for

Do all I can to help you get more
If you forgive my slight intrusion 
I see this night is confusin
A constant fight with illusions 

Shed a light on conclusions
What you desire is a way out
Day in and day out
Do not disturb signs so ill stay out

How long will you let the torture grasp you
I see spirits manifestin'
Blockin' blessings with the questions 
That you hear me ask you

Keep it up so much will pass you
You can make it on a prayer 
Yeah that's true
But barely getting by when you can do more

Why would you want to
Forgettin that the woods dry and the fires on you
Life's a hustle 
Be prepared to rastle

It can be rough 
But it don't have to
You can make it full of smiles
Something to laugh to

So pick and chose my message thick
So squeeze and watch it ooze
Make it a game to where your fears lose
Lets go

There's a way that seems right
In the heart of a man
And many angels of light
In disguise destroying man

So most chose to refuse
The absolute truth
Replace it with lies
Use ignorance as an excuse

It's hard to conceive
What the mind can't comprehend
And harder to believe
What the eyes can't understand

We look to theory philosophy and thought
For a sure foundation
In a belief we once sought
While the shadow of truth

Cast an image so clear
The closer it gets
We reject it out of fear
If we really wanted truth
We would give our lives for",Believe,2002

Stay keeping y'all guessin', stay in higher demand
Stay true to who I'm rapping, steady movin' ahead
I stay original, stay spiritual, never move outta line

If you could read up in between I stay's clear with mine
Since 89 I stayed straight, no more livin' off state
The only bars I stay locked in now are 16 or 8

Stay poppin' out the top, stay ready to tussle
Who wanna muscle, flex context in combat with bone

The first time's for free but the rest cost life, get it

Bass how low can you go
Evangelic shatter false hope like a useless relic
I'm an animal covered with hair insides mechanical
Guardin' my heart like I'm botanical
I'm snatchin' satans mandible

I damned him at best with random access
Forever banished when he left his lies vanished
Standing in the midst of chaos
Hours of praying and fasting began to pay off
At times like these can't take a day off

What I compete with I get street with
My strange language bone crushing anguish
Pain can't be quenched or vanquished
My anger rise up its ludicrous the way I throw dem bows
And swell his eyes up, ain't that cute

The honey pot that money got his hand in
It's funny how he think he got it on lock, he just a stand in
Reprimandin', rebuking 'til you understandin'

No more room in the pan I cook up rhymes in a bigger pot

Foxes and wolves in sheeps gowns

I was born in the cold
Moved to the heat
Got used to the flame
Now I spit it on beat
I was raised in the womb
Groomed by christ
With a gift to raise souls from the tomb

We ain't tryna take the slot
Blow the spot
Worldwide still parta the plot
Everybody talkin bout changinthe game
But everything I hear y'all soundin the same
From the beats to the videos
Clothes and look
Same concept for your flows and hook
See these round here they can raise the dead
So come on everybody now bob your head

Rhymes so meaty like jambalaya
Got truth for hire
Can you stand the fire
To see you come alive that's my desire now

Boy looka here
Have you ever heard a dead man talk before
You ever seen a dead man walk before
You ever heard dead man lock the flow
Like these before

My long range aim is dedicated to change
Persist to twist brains with rhymes, only God can explain
Attain divine intervention if your attentions arrested
Imprisoned and in position to listen to lessons given

Gotta make moves steadily, heavily bruising these dudes
We got the gift, but abuse tools misleading these youths see
My birthright is light in the darkness of night
To lead the lost paying the price of sacrificing my life

I've been sittin' and contemplating waiting anxiously peeking
Perception of these releases embracing the deeper reasons
Of timing and perfect season believing this thing is bigger
Than faces and sound scan reaching for the completion

Of purpose in promised land watchin' behind the curtain
For certain the game is hurtin' looking for some solution
Searchin' for revolution like music is the conclusion
Refusing to look at life a livin' for forward movement

Boy what's that there you sayin'?
I'm tight like the shorts that men look gay in
Oh Lordy, you don' said too much
My slightest touch is a cobra clutch

Let it be known, we are the epitomy of strange and bizarre
Switchin' up and change our repertoire
Come discover who we are, wreaking havoc on Satan's mavericks
Through a labyrinth filled with nooks and crannies

An elite group called the factors
We like the X-Men so uncanny, imagine looking
Up seeing the plastered ceiling cracking, it ain't because
We broke, we lost our minds for God provoked and crazy actin'

The bliss between giving my all and giving up
The highs and lows, paths and roads I chose
In the cold I froze trying to ease my woes

In this world of sin, clothes to thin to fend

Struggling since victory presumed control
Battling since the truth infiltrated my mould

Traveling down the path of a difficult road

Out to impress, ready to party
Gettin casted for tha club scenes dyin to shake her body
To get on tha set

Dancin freaky with tha rappers obsessed with poppin collers
Bought some hair and nails
Found some dudes that rap
While she's rockin tha tiny shorts and tha shirt from baby gap
Misinformed adolescent
She was teenage old
Never told of her inner goal
When she was wrongfully clothed
Just a jewel that got appraised by unqualified guys
They lied, shotload, don't kno her worth in God's eyes
Fellas after tha flesh, they ain't goin' see wat I'm gettin
'Cause they measure every girl by these video women

Pouncin the money drive em to mishaps and under
They thongs lie decay and collapse no morals perhaps
The scenery's pretty the suns shining it's nice out
A pretty girl freakin on a pimp who'd knock her lights out

Gangsta with gold fronts and the girl he's advancin on
Would rather run him over with the truck she's dancing on
And he'd be hurt up pretty badly I must say word up
It ain't over bone is third up
Don't debate it I know they hate being affiliated
To this world they created with facades that leave you devastated

The glamorous life price for your souls rest
Simple mentality in a world complex
Star studded reality 5 minutes or less
Broken dreams and ambitions lost with respect
She was an innocent queen with rubber bands and berets
Young diva runnin things commanding every step
Then the pace picked up and she learned to be fast
Short skirt tight clothes good spirit turned bad

At the cost you played whatever price you paid
Through away your identity even changed your name

anybody out there, anybody on the landscape
any-anybody? Am I talking to myself?
body-body Anybody
I need to rationalize
Anybody see the passion in my eyes?

this flip life, sorta stuff I observe
is often times triflin, throwin me a curve
Seem a little life been getting a little blurred
Lately my wife's been praying for me, word.

God, know I'm thankful for the blessings I receive
but who wants to give up what they want for what they need
A lotta things are promises, a lot are true indead
Some of ya'll ain't hearin me, let me bring you up to speed

Maybe we'll stop 
Maybe the album will flop
Maybe we'll cop nice cribs on the way to the top
Maybe we'll stay right her in the jar remainers
Keep believing with the truth, leading a pack to fall

Right now my heart is so heavy
I cry tears until I'm empty
I feel so alone, don't you hear me say?
I gotta break these chains
I gotta break these chains

Have you ever felt alone like nobody cares?
And even at home ain't nobody there?
But somebody's there
But nobody's there
Showing concern for the issues burning
The insecurity
And the fear internally
Poor self image with no real identity
Untapped potential
Unstable mental
Looking to escape from the trap you into
So you puffin puffin til you see the stars
Cuttin cuttin and you hide the scares
Poppin poppin til the pills are gone
You drink the last drop til you in the zone

...for the love complex
used and abused
bruised and confused
I'm gonna tell the truth
Ain't no substitute
That's ever gonna fufill the need inside you
Christ died for that
He left and came back
Flowed the powers sin and death alike
You can have life and get more abudant
No more questions, cap the wonderin

Right now my heart is so heavy
I cry tears until I'm empty
I feel so alone, don't you hear me say?
I gotta break these chains
I gotta break these chains

Where you tryin to go?
What you tryin to see?
Where you tryin to be?

When I start, I master the art of getting down to the heart
And set apart to spark emotion at the slightest sound
It's probably one of the realest topics ever spoke upon
Speech that God will impeach
Swallow the chunks which you choke upon
I'm gifted, I know it, still was I wandering in the path
They tell me, ""Boy, you're a star, sign me your autograph'

This can't be it, though mind gone staring into space
Sorry, where was I' Thoughts gone without a trace
Was the love of my life, hip-hop guided my wife
A combination of the three that would probably me nice
After doing suffice, I break the ice with device
And take advice that comes with the price of rolling the dice

Any weather, storms may come but conform me never
My mind transformed by words born to live forever
Scorn but still I'd rather walk in the light of the truth presented
I never understood grace till I really repented
'Till I truly committed my total self, admitted

Now my hustle has found purpose and pimpin'
I gotta get it even if bloodshed is a part of my quest

First we break bread, then break heads
Look at all the people runnin' in fear, scared
Unwillin' to hear what's said, hide under the shed
We lyin' in the filth, grown men layin' in our own beds

Pull ourselves up by the bootstraps
Hit them curves, dodge the trap, don't move at a slow pace
Hand us a mic, we move the whole place
This for each and every hood

Tell me who on it, tell me what you know that's good

Brought us enough contradiction
So now we change our position yeah, yeah

I'm in LaVergne lettin' the Chevy burn rubber every turn
Changin' lanes while the body swang heavy to the right
Like my life hit them curves swerve, as I discern to turn
Back down the one way truth and the life
I learn lessons every block countin' blessings like rocks
As I bubble in the struggle in the Classic Caprice

Releasin' pressure like these woofers in the back of my seats
And speakin' clearer than these tweeters when I'm over these beats
I check the navigation to see what direction to take
To lead a generation headed for collision with fate
On the darker side in the ride lookin' through rear views
In full speed searchin' for a you turn to save you hittin' curves

We keep speakin' these verses
In purpose of breakin' curses
With persecutional surface keep tryin' to
Put us in hearses it seems
Even the churches been blinded for recognizin' our talent
It's part of the plans of God reachin' man

Understand so many searchin', understand so many hurtin'
Flirtin' with death, and slowly closin' the curtain on hope
To find a better way, a brighter light and darker days
Strike the spark to start, and burn a bluer blaze
Maybe we missed it but um, what if we didn't these drums
Maybe the difference is needed for when it sums

So I dedicated my body to be the sacrifice
Livin' and the beat it copy write written to raise dead
And the course read led by be sweat
Which is to be the beacon they seakin', when somethin' has gotta give
So eternal existence is not a tellital mistant
But a reality of faith, believin' in He, recievin' through me

Control the freak in me secretly that's what's crackin' baby

And you don't have to hate me
Or under rate what I do
Conviction with diction I choose to use expressin' my view
Tell me whose land we on
And get a gander of the man and conversate

Attackin' my defenses
So relentless knock me senseless

When I look in your eyes I see me

Let me conversate to you for a minute
Yo, see I never was one too fond of mirrors
The fear of self was oh so clearer then when I was a knee high
Coming up to breathe life, taking these deep breaths

Climbing up these steep steps to get me to the next stage
Next page, find me, me and you become one from two
Many levels passed, many devils wrestled
Many victories through stressful tasks

Much growing up from a too eventful past

Had to learn how to save my gas
Owned some Keith Sweat, making it blast
Like game on, making the cash

Got to keep the wisdom and the history of the family's past
So we're robbing old folks and making a dash
I really love making you laugh when you smile
I see the best of me in your eyes

When I look in your eyes I see me
When I look in your eyes I see me

Now I just await the moment for my world to end
You know I got to get up a lot to live for
Folks waiting in the wings, pulsating to redeem

See how much I really bring the tables will clad us
Disable the fool, the fat, and the fables that got us to the plate
Pitching and batting, working my gums like mad
Hitchhiking the path and biking and striking the apt with math

It'll be like I be opposition to those who rustle leaves
Look at my demeanor, sneeze, you up for the tussle? Please
There's a greater power guiding my step
And ain't ashamed to admit I was preserved and kept

These are moments in time documented and recorded in rhyme
That will sit in the archives as the lives intertwine
So, mirrored images I hope you find, I hope your focus is
As close as you ever get to the end, keep an open mind, player

When I look in your eyes I see me
When I look in your eyes I see me

I ain't through yet, listen
If I'm the greatest hit then y'all the best of
The perfect illustration of my God's express love
I never been ashamed to ever say that I messed up

Like Usher, my confessions get raw to check love
To gain the respect of my kids indeed
From a boy to a man on bended knees
And that's the reason why I bruise them seeds

To ensure a better life than was given to me
'Cause y'all deserve that, need that
Proceed that which I leave back when I'm gone
And, when I'm gone, y'all take the throne

Lead the family on and keep righting the wrongs
Keep the word of God close 'cause this life ain't long
Stay true to his direction, man, despite these clones
So when they look in your eyes, they see me
And beyond that they see Christ and live that life

When I look in your eyes I see me
When I look in your eyes I see me
When I look in your eyes I see me
When I look in your eyes I see me",In Your Eyes,2004
Grits,"Deadlocked in the zone, we prone to dip into the unknown
Quick to flip if one trip, first we break bread, then break heads
Look at all the people runnin' in fear, scared
Unwilling to hear what's said, hide under the shed
We lyin' in the filth, grown men layin' in our own beds
Pull ourselves up by the bootstraps
Hit them curves, dodge the trap
Don't move at a slow pace
Hand us a mic, we move the whole place
This for each and every hood,
Eighteenth Ave, Wedgewood, South side, clean cutz
Tell me who on it, tell me what you know that's good
Baller blockin' ain't an option, that ain't the purpose of my concoction
Releasin' toxins in the abyss, boxin' you in so you don't miss
Me gettin' you rockin', Nashville
Proud I'm in it, been a minute
Gettin' our due, me and my crew
Rep our city, how ‘bout you?
Hittin' curves!

Hittin' Curves, shorty, baby, ooo hoo

That's why we tell them
Swerving we ruling we serving
Hittin' them curves and then we
Pushing them verses them curses
They must be broken yeah
Taking them Tennessee corners
And changing lanes cause they
Brought us enough contradiction
So now we change our position yeah, yeah

Bonafide's verse
I'm in LaVergne letting the Chevy burn rubber every turn
Changing lanes while the body swang heavy to the right
Like my life hit them curves swerve as I discern to turn
Back down the one way truth and the life
I learn lessons every block counting blessings like rocks
As I bubble in the struggle in the Classic Caprice
Releasing pressure like these woofers in the back of my seats
And speaking clearer than these tweeters when I'm over these beats
I check the navigation to see what direction to take
To lead a generation headed for collision with fate
On the darker side in the ride looking through rear views
In full speed searching for a you turn to save you hittin' curves

Swerving hittin' curves and serving
Pushing the verses for the curses
Must be broken so we focused
Stop sign and the place can't hold us
Taking them Tennessee corners

Enough contradiction so now
We change our position yeah, yeah",Hittin Curves,2006

You wanna know why we do this

We keep speakin' these verses
In purpose of breakin' curses
With persecutional surface keep tryin' to
Put us in hearses it seems
Even the churches been blinded for recognizin' our talent
It's part of the plans of God reachin' man

Understand so many searchin', understand so many hurtin'
Flirtin' with death, and slowly closin' the curtain on hope
To find a better way, a brighter light and darker days
Strike the spark to start, and burn a bluer blaze
Maybe we missed it but um, what if we didn't these drums
Maybe the difference is needed for when it sums

So I dedicated my body to be the sacrifice
Livin' and the beat it copy write written to raise dead
And the course read led by be sweat
Which is to be the beacon they seakin', when somethin' has gotta give
So eternal existence is not a tellital mistant
But a reality of faith, believin' in He, recievin' through me

Happiness is my accomplice
Part of myself, up outa this rut without a map or compass
Doin' good is so presumtius
It's one of my many functions
I got the skinny anyone of y'all walkin' awful penny
That's why I speak so gently

Help out like Farnsworth Bentley
Just do my part and put my heart and whole, though trials may tempt me
Play full of the emotions pinley
Speak through my actions lately
Problems is stackin' baby
Control the freak in me secretly that's what's crackin' baby

And you don't have to hate me
Or under rate what I do
Conviction with diction I choose to use expressin' my view
Tell me whose land we on
And get a gander of the man and conversate
(Oh)
When and whose gate we landed on

Attackin' my defenses
So relentless knock me senseless
And I woke to those ones faces and the traces of repentance
Baby gotcha smellin' the guns smoke smoke
I awoke profusely and loosely
Evoke the one quote

Same concept for your flows and hook
See these round here they can raise the dead
So come on everybody now bob your head
why'all need to heed these words from the wise
Rhymes so meaty like jambalaya
Got truth for hire
Can you stand the fire
To see you come alive that's my desire now

Have you ever heard a dead man talk before
You ever seen a dead man walk before
You ever heard dead man lock the flow

Lookin for that love I once knew
Runnin runnin 
Trying to find my way back to you

I been runnin since understandin confiscated my globe
Shuttering since expression stole the key to my soul
Struggling since victory presumed control
Battling since the truth infiltrated my mold
Seeking to kind a life in invisible hold
Traveling down a path of a difficult road
Running without a clue of being left astray
Swearing I'm getting closer but really further away
Runnin

Don't you sometimes sit back and look at yourself
Examine things in life you hate but you've become get sick of yourself
The very images you claim lack worth
Then with uncontrolled labor pains them very images you gave birth
This topic got me ceiling walkin 
I'm so beside myself I'm lookin at me like I'm someone else and I don't feel I'm talkin
I'm tryin to spit it best I can atcha 
Your life you really need to rid it of attention grabbers that keep you from runnin

Runnin
My desires lead me right to you
The very thing that has me runnin
Back to you

In desilate times I wrestle at times
Feeling so neglected at times rejected at times
Hard to try to get out my mind hold to the soul
Believing that its gonna be fine he's in control
Letting go the walk in the know forgetting the how
Strong enougfh to wait for the when to weaken the now

If dead men tell no tales 
How do you account for the platinum rappers with millions of record sales 
Then tell me I ain't good 'cause my record fails
With a standard that's set to first-quarter sales the truth shall prevail
If I let you dictate it life would be stale (whoo)

Your tired hands that crawl and grasp
The soft ground
By the look on your face
You set out on a path
Never to arrive
By the look on your face
The burden's on your back
And the sun is in your eyes

Stretched out, far and wide
The light that scorched the sand
So bright, so long
I'm never coming back

And every stone and every step
I won't recall
Emptied out of every thought
Just soft ground
By the look on your face
The burden's on your back
And the sun in your eyes

Gone at last
Stretched out, far and wide
The light that scorched the sand
So bright, so long
I'm never coming back

It overflows, it overflows, it always runs
It overflows, it overflows, it always runs
Silver and silent
Endless abundance overflows

Silver and silent rushing on
Endless abundance overflows
Always surround you, always glows
Oh

Look on your face,
Burden's on your back
Sun is in your eyes

Stretched out, far and wide
The light that scorched the sand
So bright, so long
I'm never coming back
So bright, so long
I'm never coming back",Sun in Your Eyes,2012
Grizzly Bear,"Talk to yourself
Please make your mind up
Is there anything left
At all, all, all
Everything all at once
And I might
Leave you two times
So dark my eyes

I never leave the light on
Please make your mind up
Weary when I do us wrong
But we try
Everything all at once
And I might
Leave you two times
So dark my eyes

Cloistered from yourself
You never even try
Best just lie down
And close your eyes for once
Before your will just goes

Surrounded by the throng
A mounting wave of sound
The clamor breaks me down
The ground beneath me gone
The sky might open up

Ah, oh, oh

Grizzly Bear,"Yet again we're the only ones
No surprise, this is often how it's done
Lately it's about all I can take
I will move and mend and mold this break

Shell with another crack
I'm small but I can keep track
Too soon, everyone just step away
I'm sure this isn't the last play

Take it all in stride
Speak, don't confide
We barely had a case
It's done before we try
Stop and end by night
A desert in your face

Take score, even playing fields this game
I know when all's said we're the same
If I could I would leave it all be
No chance to move backwards and see

Take it all in stride
Speak, don't confide
We barely had a case
It's done before we try
Stop and end by night
A desert in your face

Take it all in stride
Speak, don't confide
We barely had a case

Stop and end by night

Grizzly Bear,"Those saints in lockstep
All crossed the wasteland
Forever gone
They'll hum and walk along

Plod ever onward
Across some tundra
The light is long
But it's not long before it's gone
Well fine

And it calls you back to mind
At once
At last
Oh goodness mercy mine
Soldier on
But please not so long this time

Too young and thoughtless
To calm your memories
I know it's wrong
Just give until it's gone

Some tired mantra
Calls ever onward
Shout it loud
Just make it up somehow
Well alright

And it'll call you back to mind
At once
At last
Oh goodness mercy mine
Soldier on
But please not so long
This time

That all you trust is a cynical phrase
No time no place

No wrong or right
Just do whatever you like

Grizzly Bear,"Under your hard lens
Making too few ends
Meet a middle ground I know, it's defense

Oily hands, slippery slope
Pointed fangs without scope

Understand me
I know
No mistaken time goes
Undeserved without, everything, everyone you know

Even if Will calls
Doesn't mean fall out
We once had a thing I know, vanished

All of my rights lingering
It isn't a place that I've been

I don't wanna be, I don't wanna know the lies
Shouldn't ever be what it was alright
I'll choose to believe what's right
Even if in the end I'm blind
I don't wanna be, I don't wanna know the lies
Couldn't ever be what it was, alright?

Even if we send
Everything from both ends
So little left to, say, do, it depends

If we are past what we keep
All that was promised that was sheathed

No mention of our,
Unchecked accord
I leave this, without regret, or hearsay

Even though I'll move on
Doesn't mean this goes strong
Can't believe it to be undone, finished

Say what you want me to believe
Please show me something I can see

I don't wanna be, I don't wanna know the lies
Wouldn't ever be what it was alright
I'll choose to believe what's right
Even if if in the end I'm blind
I don't wanna be, I don't wanna know the lies
Couldn't ever be what it was, alright
I'll choose to believe what's right
Even if in the end I'm blind",Will Calls [Marfa Demo] [Demo Version],2012

Scream and roar or test your might

Growing inside of me
Never ever letting go
Medicine is not what I need
Inhale your older self
Cut it up and let it go

Focused on the point that won't be found
Moving slowly with clear resolve
Written on your face, the only truth
Pure as ether, that empty room
Can't you see, who you'll see?
What's out in front of you?
A blank sheet

You stared into the wall
Tangled up in a pile

Living in a pile

Planes flying overhead so early
Dreadful sound

Four cypresses seen from a neighbor's yard
No memory, a future
Drawing down

Object of all desire
Our fears that make us cruel
Object of all desire

Grizzly Bear,"When I woke up today I was so bound
To a memory cut long ago
I could hear all your words echo on down
And then my heart rate dropped to a crawl

Move too fast
Here we are
Can't let go
Take the past
Own your scars
Let it show

Could I ask of you not to cut into me
Dividing all of my body for me
I was left here to go through all the pieces
Nothing more to spare

I keep looking for reasons to come 'round
To make sense of your internal row
It's a maze and there's nothing to be found
It just leads me away from my end goal

Move too fast
Here we are
Can't let go
Take the past
Own your scars
Let it show

Like a rogue wave you
Wash right over me
Losing all sense of what my body could feel
I was able to drift away from here
I have lost all control

One night to lie so long awake

The sky took hold
Of all my little daily fears
They never seem to go

A dusty vista
You hunger for the core
I never meant to take it so far
In me it never shows

Who I am beneath the surface
Hiding out so long inside my mind
Every day I stay, run through it
And it comes and tears me open
Why? All the time

Your heart is erasing
The time just grows
And left me with little doubt
That there's anywhere to go

I'm pushing forward
To leave this home
I never meant to stay so long

Hiding out so long inside my mind
Every day I stay, run through it
And it comes and tears me open

A girl could feel special on any such like.""
Says James, to Red Molly, ""My hat's off to you.
It's a Vincent Black Lightning, 1952.

And I've seen you on the corners and cafes, it seems.
Red hair and black leather, my favorite color scheme.""
And he pulled her on behind,
And down to Boxhill,

They'd Ride.
Says James, to Red Molly, ""Here's a ring for your right hand.
But I'll tell you in earnest I'm a dangerous man;
For I've fought with the law since I was seventeen.

I've robbed many a man to get my Vincent machine.
And now I'm twenty-one years, I might make twenty-two.
And I don't mind dyin' but for the love of you.
But if fate should break my stride, then I'll give you my Vincent, To Ride.""

""Come down Red Molly,"" called Sargent McQuade.
""For they've taken young James Aidee for Armed Robbery.
Shotgun blast hit his chest, left nothing inside.
Oh, come down, Red Molly, to his dying bedside.""

When she came to the hospital, there wasn't much left.
He was runnin' out of road. He was runnin' out of breath.
But he smiled, to see her cry.
And said, ""I'll give you my Vincent.
To Ride.""

Said James, ""In my opinion, there's nothing in this world
Beats a '52 Vincent and a Redheaded girl.
Now Nortons and Indians and Greavses won't do.
Oh, they don't have a Soul like a Vincent '52.""

Well he reached for her hand and he slipped her the keys.
He said, ""I've got no further use...for these.
I see Angels on Ariels in leather and chrome,
Swoopin' down from Heaven to carry me home.""

And he gave her one last kiss and died.
And he gave her his Vincent.

When love flew in through my window wide
And quickened my hum-drum heart
Love flew in through my window
I was so happy then
But after love had stayed a little while
Love flew out again

What is this thing called love?
This funny thing called love?
Just who can solve its mystery?
Why should it make a fool of me?
I saw you there one wonderful day
You took my heart and threw my heart away
That's why I ask the Lawd up in Heaven above
What is this thing called love?

You gave me days of sunshine
You gave me nights of cheer
You made my life an enchanted dream
'Til somebody else came near
Somebody else came near you
I felt the winter's chill
And now I sit and wonder night and day
Why I love you still",What Is This Thing Called Love,2007
Groove,"I know you told me
Such a long time ago
That you didn't want me
You didn't love me no more

I want to know
Oh, what makes me be
do you believe me child
A fool for you
Ohoh, no, I'm a fool for you

I know you told me
You didn't want me 'round
And I know
You got a man way 'cross town

So I know it's something
Oh, what makes me be
do you believe me child
I'm a fool for you
Ohoh, no, I'm a fool for you

Did ya ever wake up in the morning
Just about the break of day
Reach over and feel the pillow
Where your baby used to lay
Then you put on your crying
Like you never cried before
Oh lord
Yeah you even cry so loud,
You give the blues to your neighbour next door
Ever since you were five years old
I been a fool for you, little girl
Way down in my soul
I'm a little fool for ya

Not because you getting money

Been down like Amadeus blend the eclectic

Super-human MC powers help me fly around the planet
Touch the microphone device, whole countries get flattened
Saving damsels in distress so young girls don't panic
Putting MCs under pressure till they crack like ceramic
Always thought they could flow but sink like the Titanic

Rhymes rip through your skull like icebergs through the hull
Survive the impact, and arctic cold freezes your soul
Create a new style, then break the mold
Compositions are controlled, and liable to explode
Like land mines, my crew blows through like wind chimes
Make it hot like fire, two hundred proof like Moonshine

Risky, playing yourself is risky
And the flows mad jazzy like Dizzy Gillespie
And the sound be harmonious and deadly

I drop the truth, cause rhyming is more than just my craft

When niggas is kickin' that old off the wall shit, let em know

You fools, you work all week and give the devil back his loot
For jewels, and the steak on your plate is filled
With chemicals, still, brothers leave brothers
All battered and bruised, on the streets
Won't see snakes on my feet
The race is on, but I won't compete
In this competition, because I have a greater mission
I hope that you listen
Knowledge wisdom and understanding brings, long life
And health, think anything else and ya playin' yaself

Still spinning from the night that we had,
In the mirror where I brush my teeth at,
There's three more heads, and they watching me back,
Read the bread while I toast my pay check,
One the girls said grins a safe bet,
Phone ringing an I refuse to take it,
want to play dead but I'm on the dayshift,
Stepping out on to the weekly rota,
On the cheap share a seat with Olga,
Train driver said it ain't a joka,
Were gonna be stuck till I fix the motta,
Half hour in-between the stations,
Start jogging when I hit the pavement,
Ran straight into a situation,
Cops say stop cause I ain't Caucasian,
Whole hour on explanation,
Missed the bus an the cab was ancient,
I'm really now in a situation,
When I return to my destination,
I get told to collect my payment,
Clear the desk quick make it vacant,
Now if I ever needed inspiration,
Right about now where I lose my patience,
If I ever needed inspiration,
Right about here's where i lose my patience,
Do it now, do it now,

1,2,3,4
Always said I want a new agenda,
Do it now while I still remember,
Small fish in a mixin' blenda,
All the bets set on the next offenda,
I had enough being nice and anxious,
I keep sweet all the trendy bankers,
I'm looking more than the war the pension,
Under attack of the apprehension,
I'm too transformed to lose the motion,
I might shout now out and open,
All the hanging on the years of hopin',
The same things now feel provoking,
So hot that the tears are smoking,

Watch now my might just crunch the whole thing,
Watch now my might just crunch the whole thing,

Now if I ever needed inspiration,

They notice fast
And some mistakes were built to last

Live your life and let mine be

Will I remember, can I remember
I see the motion in your soul
Will I remember, can I remember

She sings to the moon and the stars in the sky
Shining from high above you shouldn't ask why

She is the one that you never forget
She is the heaven-sent angel you met
Oh, she must be the reason why God made a girl
She is so pretty all over the world

She puts the rhythm, the beat in the drum
She comes in the morning and the evening she's gone
Every little hour every second you live
Trust in eternity that's what she gives

She talks like Monica and Marianne
She wins in everything that she might do
And she will respect you forever just you

Thanks for making me that strong and that you made me write this song.

Groove Mekanix,"In the day we sweat it out on the streets of a runaway American dream
At night we ride through the mansions of glory in suicide machines
Sprung from cages out on highway nine,
Chrome wheeled, fuel injected,and steppin' out over the line
H-Oh, Baby this town rips the bones from your back
It's a death trap, it's a suicide rap
We gotta get out while we're young
`Cause tramps like us, baby we were born to run

Yes, girl we were

Wendy let me in I wanna be your friend
I want to guard your dreams and visions
Just wrap your legs 'round these velvet rims
And strap your hands 'cross my engines
Together we could break this trap
We'll run till we drop, baby we'll never go back
H-Oh, Will you walk with me out on the wire
`Cause baby I'm just a scared and lonely rider
But I gotta know how it feels
I want to know if love is wild
Babe I want to know if love is real

Oh, can you show me

Beyond the Palace hemi-powered drones scream down the boulevard
Girls comb their hair in rearview mirrors
And the boys try to look so hard
The amusement park rises bold and stark
Kids are huddled on the beach in a mist
I wanna die with you Wendy on the street tonight
In an everlasting kiss

One, two, three, four

The highway's jammed with broken heroes on a last chance power drive
Everybody's out on the run tonight
But there's no place left to hide
Together Wendy we can live with the sadness
I'll love you with all the madness in my soul
H-Oh, Someday girl I don't know when
We're gonna get to that place
Where we really wanna go

She doesn't need it but she won't try
Try to release it
Cause she thinks she'll die
Depending on it for it she'll lie
It's only a 10 minute high
Eyes
That witnessed a father beat on a mother
Witnessed a system take away her only brother
No one ever said that they loved her
She used to shut her eyes and make the pain subside
But now she's got her 

10 minute high
Just for a little while
She's queen of all the skies
If a hid is bad another one she can buy
Everybody tells her to stop
She would try
But nobody gave her a good reason why

Time has taken it's toll
She looks too old for seventeen
The girl is much too bold
Her heart is cold
When it used to be of gold
Her future has no chance to unfold
She's used her body to get her ways
Is she ashamed of the games she's played
But her best defense is to block out all the pain
But first she buys her

10 minute high
Just for a little while she's floating through the sky
What's she gonna do when she no longer can fly
Is she gonna land on her feet or come down to die
Or is she gonna just break down and cry

When she comes down it all becomes too clear
She knows that someday she should face her fears
But with a touch of reality and over the years
She's forgotten how it feels to be real
It's early morning quiet is the street
She lays in silence the cold cement beneath her feet
She passed away and today's her eighteenth birthday
And all she's left me to say is

She just had her last 10 minute high
Did she contemplate that it would take away her life
She probably knew but she had no reason to fight
There is not a breath on her lips not even a sigh
If only she had known wrong from right
If only she had known
Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye, goodbye, girl
Goodbye, bye

It hit me that i really loved you're way
I thought 4 sure I'd be here 2 stay baby
2 my surprise I'd soon be running away, running away

[Chorus:]
If I ever see you walkin'
I won't know what 2 say
Or do
So what's the use in talkin'
All that's left 2 say is hey you,
Hey u...
Those times
Were some of the happiest in life
Count the years since I left you behind
Oh stayed with me like Georgia on my mind
Never left my mind
These eyes
Have searched the land from moonfall 'til sunrise
Searchin' 4 just 1 good reason why
Why'd you have 2 go and do me so wrong, yet do me
so right

[Chorus]
Whether it's right or wrong
you share a life
With the one you loved before you met me
If i cud stop holding on
And wondering why you are gone
The I wud be free
I wud be free

A stronger heart
A stronger soul to pull me through

It's gonna be (alright), take it from me

You can cut a calf in half and make baloney

You may not bag a lion or a tiger or a bear 
But if you want a jack-ass there are plenty of them there

Chicken fricassee and ice cream cake

Had no muscles and I had no spine
But now I'm friskier than a pup

Just feed me black strap molasses and the wheat germ bread

You add some yogurt and you'll be well fed

Doctors told the guy that he was through
But now that the doctor has been proven wrong
He's got more hop in him than Hopalong

Radio up and came to a stoplight
Had a man who came up to my window and
Asked for a dollar cause he was in a tight jam

Judged by the world and everyone that's close to him

Just look inside your soul cause
We got a lot in common

And thinking back on my life and not forgetting the days
When I was a little lost and only trying to get paid
And how my momma always prayed that I would be ok
Then a day soon came when my sky turned grey
And every friend that I had turned and walked away
I never thought that I would see this day
But then I heard a voice crying through the dark
You're my son just pray
And what I said next vexed my heart but nonetheless
Admitted that I was wrong, committed to do my best
Hard times still came but they far from my chest
I breathe easy believe me my soul's at rest

I can tell in your vision that you can't no more
Your shirt is stained by the tears that nobody ever saw
A slave to solitude handcuffed by people's claws
Who never even noticed the depth of the scars
A fatherless child who never got the chance to hold
Daddy's hand and mommy was always working trying to pay the rent
So your voyage began on a trail to the end
Cause you never knew what love looked like to begin
But I promise that the day will come when you win
And what you thought was once lost will be placed in your hand
Then the days of being second will be lost in the wind
So bear with us and let me hear the chorus again

Through all the low times
No where to go times
When your world's crashing down
And there's no one around
Don't you worry we can make it
If we just realize we all look the same inside
Get together and come alive",A Lot in Common,2006
Group 1 Crew,"Everybody's gotta song to sing
So won't you come now and sing with me
It doesn't really matter where you're from or what you've done
Everybody's gotta story to tell
Times we've tried and times we failed
So when you feel like hope is gone keep holding on
This is your song

I've seen days when my life seemed hard and absurd
All of my words died cause they never were heard, like they
Left my mouth then fell to the curb
Got trampled by life and every lesson I've learned
Why do good people leave this earth before their time
It hurts to see death get the best of us first
Yet I know a times comin' when I
Will feel the breeze in my eyes
Dry my tears and fade away in the sky
I see the day my family believes God
And puts away the facade
Of being ok when I know they're not
But I know You're gonna take what I write
Bring this story to life for Your people tonight

Yo everybody has a story
And it needs to be heard
So let it play and resonate
From the hood to the burbs
Whether your sky is grey
And you, been through it all
There's somebody on this earth
That is singing the same song.
Some one across the Pacific
Is stressed from hard labor,
Searching desperately
Cause he's in need of Savior,
Barely ever home
Ignores his kids for the paper
And you'll never know
This same tune's being sung by your neighbor
See age doesn't matter
When life wants to fail you
When your color don't determine
Whether you're destined for failure
We all run to the sun
And hide from the rainy weather
But we make beautiful music
When we all unite together and

I know it's been hard
To make it this far
But God knows your heart
And every need",(Everybody's Gotta) Song to Sing,2007
Group 1 Crew,"Clap, clap ya hands
Clap, clap ya hands

We found a new way to rock it while we doin' our thing
And bringing acapella fellas and my ladies that sing
We clap hands like, what
What we doing is a new form of music
That got you getting out of your seats

All of you with hands up
Everybody we're doing this in the name of
The One who took us from nothing but now we came up.

Now hold on, we rockin' with ya'll move to the song
It's been a while since we gave y'all something to rock on
Two emcees, a vocalist we've been sent on a mission
To reach a people who been tired of the new religion

He's so divine that our rhymes shine solely for Him
And so we kindly remind every person within
You'll get your time in the lime if you find it in Him
And every line that you sign - never sell out to win.

You put the rhythm in my feet so I could dance
Now all I want to do is clap my hands
You put a song in my heart now I can sing
Let this music lead you on
To that place where you belong
Where we could be free to lift him up
And keep it going on and on.

Everybody if you are free come follow me
Everybody if you are free come follow me
Everybody if you are free come follow me
Everybody if you are free come follow me

So underrated
Clap hands for those who made it
And we clap for every single person that's hated
Because we clap for the purpose that is
Greater than us

Clap if you vibin' with us",Clap Ya Hands,2007
Group 1 Crew,"Lord I've got a problem
And I can't find the solution- no
I'm seeing all these people
Always searching for improvement
We're always looking for that next thing to satisfy
But all I see is broken hearts, so many sleepless nights
Help me Lord to help them
Heal that empty feeling inside and we say

So if you really want to know who you are
No more wondering and looking so far
The truth is right in front of you- don't let it go
You need to- come back home
Cause everything you need you can find in Him
Faith in yourself to believe again
Don't let all this time just pass you by
You need to- come back home

No I don't wanna be alone no
I can't do it on my own no

I'm lookin' all around the world and trying to find who I am
And realizing more and more that it's the plight of all man
I wanna know what am I here for and where do I stand
Within the scope of all eternity and destiny's plan
I keep replaying all the things they told me when I was young
That I could be whatever I wanted to be
But I'm far from the dreams I had
Cause all I ever seem to feel is bad
I'm trying not to be like dad
Or trying to follow every fad, no

From young to oldest we've all
Asked ourselves the same question
Questioning if there's something more
Then where we all have been
Many have spent their lifetime
In research to find solutions
For the purpose of man-kind
And what's the real reason
Why we're here and why do
We operate the way we do
And why do continue to
Wonder with out any clues
We won't put up no more with
Those who try to make us clones
We find ourselves in the blood
Of He who sits on the throne

So, so lost I just can't find my way
Lord I really need you to help me
So, so lost I just can't find my place",Come Back Home,2007
Group 1 Crew,"Father, I'm going through some heavy things
It seems like this world ain't getting any better
The more we try to get closer to You
The farther we run from Your throne

I've spent so many nights wonderin' when will it end
When will the day come when happiness begins
I'm running the race but it seems too hard to win
I'm sick of mourning my stomach is throwing up in the morning

I'm calling for help and watching it melt away
My heart's been put on display and put away
In many ways, many times I told myself it was ok
And anger was the price that was paid
While these faded dreams just screamed to bring them home

The burden was too heavy I kept running from the throne
I can't take it any longer
I can taste my spirit hunger
God please help me get home

Lord though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death
I'm not scared cause You're holding my breath
I only fear that I don't have enough time left
To tell the world that there's no time left, Lord please
Lord though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death
I'm not scared cause You're holding my breath
I only fear that I don't have enough time left
To tell the world that there's no time left

I've come to terms that I'm burning both sides of the rope
And I'm hoping that self-control would kick in before I'm choking off
The sin that be destroying every fiber I got
I need the Lord in every way I'll never make it I'm not
Going back to the way I was before Christ in my life
I couldn't do it I would lose it there's no point to the fight
And I'm writing this song, for the people who don't belong
I pray away the pain you feel from all the things that went wrong
Inside a life that's filled with anger and disappointment
'Cause daddy treated you weaker than all of the other kids
It's annoying and I feel for all of you who wanna give up
You feel stuck I feel the same way Lord help us stay up
You couldn't pay me to abandon the idea of true hope
That I could make it through this life into a place where there's no crying
I'm dying to find You with open arms when I go
Knowing You love me and You waiting to give rest to my soul

Lord I don't know what I'm struggling for
There's go to be more
Than this life I know
But still I'm here fighting to never give up
I find strength in Your love
And You will see me through",Forgive Me,2007
Group 1 Crew,"Yeah...it's been a long time coming y'all...
We dreamin' big...(it's the anthem)... it's Group 1

Yo since the first time this little boy picked up a mic
I've been dreaming for the day that you would hear it and like
Every word that I spit hoping you could relate
To every pain that I've been feeling since I came out the gate
Used to dream about making it a six-figure deal
To show this world that this life that I've been living is real
When I make it I'm gonna do everything that I've promised
By remaining honest and praise to my God I'll pay homage
Take my parents out the stress that they've known all they life
And pay all of their bills never gotta work till they die
No more asking for extensions to avoid late fees
And no more late nights crying by their bed on their knees
No buying food on credit cause we're lacking the funds
No more wondering where all of this money will come from
God will see me to the day when these words breathe life
And manifest the very faith that I continue to write

[Chorus:]
A young kid growing up it was hard to adapt
The world didn't love me so I started to rap it's cause...
I...I have a dream, I...I have a dream
Late nights all alone steady feeling confused
I took a look at my life ain't got nothing to lose it's cause...
I...I have a dream, I...I have a dream

A young girl growing up it was hard to adapt
I felt like every other girl was given life with a map
They seemed to know where they were going
I didn't know jack, I had to play it cool never let them see where I'm at
But baby girl got tired, and I would never see my daddy
All the boys were liars, and they were always getting at me
You see I tried hard to remove all the scars
But I could never see my dreams they were always too far
Dreams of being free dreams of being able to sing
I dreamt a man loved me cause I wasn't scared to be me
I saw a life where every woman had respect for herself
And every little girl would run and ask her mommy for help
I'm not afraid to write a song that exposes my pain
I lived my life backwards so when it poured it rained
But I got through the weather now I'm changing the game
And dreaming remains the source of everything we proclaim

A young buck only knee high
With thoughts of reaching the sky
Rocked ball caps but knew
My crown was a king size
A product of my father's labor
And my mother's reprise
To keep my eyes past the
Blue collar and live wise
I can't lie, I thought of what it would be like
If I compromise
Walk a lie
Spit death instead of life
Choose to cross the line
Keep a foot on both sides
But the dream is too large
For it to be hid inside
My kid's seeds will inherit daddies dreams
Daddies dreams of never having to hustle for the green
Or being a slave to mans work
Just to meet their needs
And mami and papi
Will reap the harvest of my deeds
I paint a path for a generation to come
No longer a peasant or slave
Your own kingdom
I scream freedom
And let it echo through the slums
Rise up pump your fist
And march to the pace of the drum

Powerful to protect me through the hard times that always exist
Make the hardest heart break down
Make a person who hates
Love himself so he can love those around
It takes love to forgive everyone
For all the things they've done
It's not easy but the freedom will come
We gotta learn why it is that we here
It's more than loving your life
It's making sure your life is loving your peers
Now if you could just catch my heart
Then we can part from the past
Let the days of the new love start because

Love is a beautiful thing
That brings together people of every generation
Love can heal the pain of a broken world

And all it takes is love

Love's the reason we are here
We're the object of affection from a God who holds us dear
And every where we go and everything that we do
Every time that we love
It's a reflection of You
Cause You are true love

Stop holdin' on to the past

Without the truth being spoken that the broken can find
I've been down one too many times but I
Wanna blow up like Kanye and touch the sky
So I can teach all my people what it means to fly
And see they life at a height that's parallel to God's eyes
I wanna leave a legacy that's beyond any song

Can reach for the stars

Had a head on collision
With fate and I don't know know how
You changed my world made me your home
And no one else allowed
To enter cause you alone inside
Makes it a full full house

Remember when you were far
Loved me with a broken heart
But since we've made contact
Our eyes have never been apart

I didn't stop to think of what's going on
Outside my window, the world is changing
I can't remember where it all went wrong

A mama's praying that her baby comes home
I see the future of a better place

So I wanna make, make this a place
Where we can forget all the problems of yesterday
Let's make a change for a better today
Let it begin with me, make it reality, I wanna change

I never believed that, that, that things will never change
Cause whenever I look back, back, nothing has stayed the same
Except that all I see are shadows of me, times where
I just fail to believe that faith is not whatever you see
But hoping what it really could be

So we can make a difference if we turn it around
The world is upside down
The revolution starts inside, yeah

Change, make this a place

Where unity can be the brush to paint a better picture
We need to plant a seed of something we're all in need off
Through God we can make this world
Into something we only dream of

Or when I'm downtown as I wait for the bus
I see you, oh, how I see you
Oh, on the lonely nights when I stare at the stars
And how the trees blow as I walk through the park
And I see you, oh, how I see you

I see you in my mind and every time I wake up
Reminds me of the time when I was trying to find love
And I would, try so hard to show you how good I was
But all I did was prove that it was never enough

'Cause you loved me like I was your sweet buttercup
And I'm addicted to the way that you would never give up
I see us on the cover of our own magazine
We call it ""Life in the arms of a king"" and we would talk about

Everything and anything
And every time that you would sing my heart would ring
So I had to pick up, I'm glad that it was you on the line
'Cause you, got me, got me out of my mind, c'mon

I've seen the highs, I've seen the lows
But where I'm going is a question that I'll never know
But what I know is that you'll always be there for me
That's why I see you in everything

Good friends they come, good friends they go
It's just a product of this crazy world and how it goes
What doesn't change is that you'll always be there for me
That's why I see you in everything

Your energy molded to take its natural form
Tangibly known through a song makes a heart feel at home
A quiet whisper through the breeze in the trees
Is how you let it be shown so I can cherish every moment that is born

My life has been better since I've read your love letters
Stress has gotten light like feathers and your genuine like leather
You made this man walk on a different level
My past is settled, I'm attached like Pinocchio and Gapetto

A masterpiece composed the greatest story ever told
There hasn't been a better headline published in the post
I won't go any where your love won't go
I've been told if it ain't broke leave it alone

I've seen the highs, I've seen the lows
But where I'm going is a question that I'll never know
But what I know is that you'll always be there for me
That's why I see you in everything

Good friends they come, good friends they go
It's just a product of this crazy world and how it goes
What doesn't change is that you'll always be there for me
That's why I see you in everything

You got me falling, got me falling for your love
And now I'm wondering if I'll ever get enough
Ain't no sunshine, ain't no sunshine
When you're not on my mind
It's so amazing how you're making me feel
When I see you I know that it's real

I've seen the highs, I've seen the lows
But where I'm going is a question that I'll never know
But what I know is that you'll always be there for me

And bring us to a place 
Where we can see the keys can never be stolen 
They just misplaced and so we
Rise from the ashes, 
Stand before the masses proclaim the victory is ours 
And so we never give up,

Its never enough for us to sit back and hope he
Has a plan we gotta stand up 
And face the cold with a boldness

Have the keys so just believe there's nothing closed

Myself and I just can't understand why I say
All those hurtful things about myself,
My insecurities, they don't seem to just go away
And it's hard for me to understand,
You loving me, through every mistake that I make
I'm so glad that you will never leave,
Keep reminding me, how you see me every day that I wake

I'm so beautiful, beautiful, beautiful uh oh uh oh
I'm so beautiful, so natural, not typical
I'm so beautiful, there's nobody else made like me
I'm so B-E-A-U-T-I-F-U-L, that's me

Yes you are
Yes you are
Yes you are
Yes you are
Yes you are
Yes you are

I love the way you made me smile,
Cause it fits my face, it's so wonderful, unbelievable
And every color in my eye is just the perfect shade,
Its so incredible, indescribable
Now you may think I'm not a perfect size or overweight,
But I'm huggable, oh so lovable
Let's put away our silly thoughts,
And fall in love with life,
Cause there's so many reasons for you to smile

I'm so beautiful, beautiful, beautiful uh oh uh oh

(I'm so B-E-A-U-T-I-F-U-L, that's me)

That's me, I like a girl who got some confidence, uncommon, but with common sense
Quick to help her mama with the groceries and condiments
Doesn't live fast, but loves life and gives compliments
Someone who I can ask about life and knows what time it is
Never late to meet me even though I always am
Give her some sorry excuse but she always understands
She can take me in some sports basketball was her thang
But at night she throws some heels on but her love is still the same
Don't need a cover girl or Maybelline cause maybe I lean a lil' closer
To the side of viewing her as a queen
And overthrows my life with the sense of humor she brings
I'd give my life away to hear her sing

I'm so beautiful, beautiful, beautiful uh oh uh oh
I'm so beautiful, so natural, not typical
I'm so beautiful, there's nobody else made like me
I'm so B-E-A-U-T-I-F-U-L, that's me
V. 2 and 3
(I'm so B-E-A-U-T-I-F-U-L, that's me)

You're beautiful

Old flames die, but You still remain.
Remain, inside my brain 'til the day they certifiably consider me insane.
Control everything I do, like a game.
Checkmate my heart, my heart won't be the same.

If I move, You can move me back, it's like that.

Got me hypnotized by the way You love.
And the truth is I, really want You for the rest of my life.
And it's true what they say about love,
A lil' bit goes a long way in trust.
I ain't ever gonna give You up,
As long as I'm still alive, I'm gonna love.

Can't think straight cuz I'm thinkin' 'bout You daily.
Been through a lot and You saved me,
Your loves ne, ne-ver failed me.
I stayed focused cuz it's hard to cope with what this world offers when You're closest,
To the top, but I can't flop, cuz I need your love to keep me on lock.

Don't need to look around,
I got You to hold me down now.

I've seen days where the nights don't end
It seems strange as I used to call friend
How can I begin to trust in the fact that you never let me go?
Been left so many times
Felt like nobody could know the sound that my heart makes when it starts to break
And the pain that I hate waits for me every day
And yet I lie awake alive and still breathing
Hoping that this time in my life is just a season
Believe in the words you spoke to your people
How you never leave even though we couldn't see you
How you make us prosper even though we couldn't pay you back
Now there's nothing that I lack

Please don't let me go
If I can't have your love my heart's got nowhere to go
Only you can rescue me
Please don't let me go
I'll be lost inside a dying world just trying to find my home
It's with you
I belong
Please don't let me go

I remember the moments life was a blur
An adolescent spirit far from mature
I couldn't tell between a friend and a foe
So alone I remained
Looked to the sky for hope
It's hard to feel alive when you're cold
It's hard to reach the sky when you know
So light is hard to find in the storm
How can I give love if my soul's been torn?
A broken vessel
You call it a masterpiece
Now I can see how deep you are in love with me
Quite honestly I can't love me how you love me
But obviously there's something that you want from me
Cause you don't want to let me go
Owner of the world but you want my soul
My heart is crying out
Lord, please take control
I need you
I don't wanna let go

Please don't let me go
If I can't have your love my heart's got nowhere to go
Only you can rescue me
Please don't let me go
I'll be lost inside a dying world just trying to find my home
It's with you
I belong
Please don't let me go

And I'm seeing who I could be without you close to me
I can't recognize that person staring back at me
And you see how my heart breaks from the choices I have made
I know your love can take it all away

Please don't let me go
If I can't have your love my heart's got nowhere to go
Only you can rescue me
Please don't let me go
I'll be lost inside a dying world just trying to find my home
It's with you
I belong

Here we go, uh yea!

I have a feeling that somebody needs to hear this song
That's right, so turn it up, turn it up
Yea just turn it up up up up up turn it up up up

I remember them days when my mama will tell me
Saying you're to busy running round
You need to calm down always looking for love

(Go slow)

Hm
She told me Love ain't easy baby believe me
It can break your heart make you fall apart
So you got to be careful, there's no need to rush it

But now I'm getting older
And each winter is getting colder now
Oh to find you some how

For now I patiently wait for you to come my way
And I wont hesitate when you make your way right to my heart
So now I patiently wait

There been so many mistakes that I known I made in the past
Love so deep that I thought it would last
But you went away and you ain't looking back
So I'm left with the pain of a heart made of glass
Why ? God I can ask all day
Nah, to my self that I'm so OK
Try, to get passed the regret and change
Cause my heart still beats to the beats of a faith that
Believes that the best of my life is still
On the horizon so blinding and real
If I hope close to his beautiful will
Then I'll find what I'm looking for, chill
With the girl that was made for me
So dang glad I gotta hide her wings
I'll just wait till the day we meet but for now I'll sing
That

I'll patiently wait for you to come my way
And I wont hesitate when you make your way right to my heart
For now I patienly wait for that one sweet day
When you take me away with you and
A fairy tale will start

4321 I'm counting down the days until I know ya

Yea huh
Let me hear the song that sync
I wonder what song she'll sing
Would it be your Frank Sinatra hit or maybe a tune by Night King
Called my stories are tad difficult
I'll be the one who would bolt after running king
Like the colts I would hurt the most
But its been a long time coming switch the play
Cause my soundtrack is humming
A new theme song featuring this truly
This is what we call a sing along

So I patiently wait for you to come my way
And I wont hesitate when you make your way right to my heart
For now I patiently wait for that one sweet day
When you take me away with you and
A fairytale will start
Till then ill patiently wait

My heart became like stone and turned to ice
Tell me what have I become
But you came just in time like a shooting star
Across my universe out of the dark
Tell me what have I become

Take me away
You save me from myself and all I do
Cause life just ain't the same when I'm with you
I can climb the sky (you got me) walking on the stars

I see life through new set of eyes
Set on someone different that I never realized
Outside my mind is a lost world that lies
But step into my thoughts you'll believe you can fly
Your words like wings gravity they defy
My heart like a leaf on the wind catchin' rides
They say we can't make it at least we gotta try
We make too much sense to foolishly pass it by
So I'm taking a rainbow up to the 5th floor
Steppin' out to see that you're really worth more
And I see our love in 3D
No more 2 dimensional worries
Climb until the sky don't exist no more
That's when I'll knock knock on your front door
Open to the possibilities I ignored
But I know now exactly what our love was meant for

Lord, take me away
You save me from myself and all I do
Cause life just ain't the same when I'm with you
I can climb the sky (you got me) walking on the stars
(Now) I can see my life from way up high
And all my troubles I once knew I left behind
I can climb the sky (you got me) walking on the stars

And I can see much more clear
When I'm lost in your atmosphere
You pull me close to the place
Where you're always waiting
So I won't stop, the walls are down
Make my way at the speed of sound
Hold me now
Hold me now

Dead bodies on their crib dead bodies on the floor

You funny, like a fuckin' dummy Bugs Bunny
Feel my wrath, here's my ass in the gold drag
'Cause I love to blast, and I love to crash
Everyday we do it around my way
Have no time to play, I just fade away

At night I use to scream and shout
Livin' in the ghetto trying to get the hell out
So I would try as I watch my friends die
But all I could do was sit back and cry
These are feelings I'm expressing through my rhymes

Let my lyrics vibrate and shake the earth
I travel ghetto to ghetto back streets to the street
Kick a rhyme or crime with this ill mastermind

Group Home,"Intro: {sample from movie}

Most persons never have a chance to get into a recording studio
Never get to see or hear a record being made
And only experience the finished product
Until now, you had no way of learning
Of the anormous complexity of the recording process
And this limits appreciation of music
We can't hope to explain all the complexity
But we hope to give you some insight
For the musical forces at work
And have a good time in the process

Chorus 2X: Lil Dap

Run for you life, if your life you live
Live behind the gun, and this is what you get
Two slugs to the head, and you're dead and gone
Listen to the word, that's how word is bond

{Agallah}
Word is on the corner of Gas & the Plate
The don who got laced up by mistake
Time flies yo we chillin at his wake
Sittin up, suing down and shit feel type fake
Nice '88 black is held down with the white face
The way shit was going, couldn't wrote out his will
Hear them be sneaking upon niggas, 'cause he love to kill
Met war, slouching cars, to send you bon voyage
One fourth of tears pullin out from the eyes of your mom
The rise of your life is on, negative or positive
You trying to live right or wrong, something just got to give
Even if you got a BM, it's the walk of dead, everytime you seen him
Prisoners walk, always try to go for freedom
Year two thou, back space, niggas delete them
Praying god, everytime we eatin

Chorus 2X

{Lil Dap}
My dreams to walk the streets open hearted with my peeps
Sweet game upon knowledge, sometime we feel like scholars
More power to devour all these fake MC's
Uncle Tom brought the playa hating jellin on me
So we jellin to our music, 'cause that's all we know
Break it down to the ghetto, with that ill ass flow
Walkin days or nights, business sights and fights
Bodies and souls are gettin picken all night
Indeed yo, in the streets this is what you see
Try to speak the forth, but no one understands me
Moms please listen to me, turning dust into black
Running straight for my life, and there's no turning back

{Blackadon}
Yo were I'm from ENY, where there at? Brooklyn
Got heads turning, from Cali to Fort Ten
I've been in the mix since before '86, and while you sucking dick
I'm strickly gettin biz
You know who it is, when you from Brooklyn
Every fuckin borough scared of them crook kids
And don't wonder why, just please come through
With your 10 karat ice, and see what we do
It ain't nuthin new, just the same old thing
Will snatch your chain, invect your brain
That was my frame of mind, when I think way back
The only thing to say was, my name was K Slack
To overgate my sins, so I can be born again
Still livin the Brooklyn rasta farayan
You listen to my words, and you will be born
A life filled, a child worn

By counting each count I knew just where to start
And one special step has stayed close to my heart

One two three, twirl round the floor
One two three, left foot you swing
One two three, then start to sing
One two three, loud as you please

won't you dance with me doing the batty bat

So now in my own castle I can enjoy
This wonderful dance that I learned as a boy
I see just how wise was my whole family
They taught me to count and so now look at me
I'm counting and dancing and I swear that it's true
If you do the same you will be happy too

Muppet 2: I'd like to be a fireman, I'd squirt you with my hose!

All: There is one thing special which everyone agrees.

Everyone likes ice cream, I do do you? 
Search the whole world over, travel near and far. 
But everyone likes ice cream no matter who they are.

Grover,"Some mornings I wake up
I feel so good and new
I find my socks myself
I put my shoes on too
The feet are right, the feet are right
Is it not wonderful that the feet are right?

I, Grover, am big and tall
and very smart and kind of cute and wonderful
I think that there is nothing I cannot do
You can get the feet right too

And then I go to eat
The cereal is not there
I see it on a shelf
I climb up on a chair
I get it down, I do not spill
Is it not wonderful that I do not spill?

[Chorus]

I go outside and play
I bouce a ball and then
I catch it right away
And bounce the ball again

I stretch myself up tall
I reach my arms out wide
I climb up trees and I go down the slide
And you can do it too
Yes, you and you and you

Now every brand new day
I get another turn
In every single way
there's more for me to learn
It feels so fine, I'm growing up
Is it not wonderful that I'm growing up?

Oh I, Grover, am big and tall
and very smart and kind of cute and wonderful
I think that there is nothing I cannot do
And you and you and you
are fine and growing too
Yes, you are fine and growing too","I, Grover",1975
Grover,"I am very proud of me,
I think I will sing out loud of me,
There ought to be a crowd of me
Because I am so special.

Yes, I do have pride in me,
I love every bright blue side of me,
I feel so satisfied in me
Because I am so special.

P-R-I-D-E spells pride,
That is P-are-I-D-E.
Pride is the feeling of feeling good about me,
About me.

Yes, indeed, I please myself,
My fingers, my toes, my knees, myself,
I hug and kiss and squeeze myself,
Because I am so special.

I seldom have a doubt of me,
I love every in and out of me,
I think I have to shout of me,
Because I am so very, very, very, very proud
Of me!",Proud of Me,1977

Grover,"Saw a monster in the mirror when I woke up today
A monster in my mirror but I did not run away
I did not shed a tear or hide beneath my bed
Though the monster looked at me and this is what he said:

He said ""Wubba wubba wubba wubba woo woo woo""
Wubba wubba wubba and a doodly do
He sang ""Wubba wubba wubba"" so I sang it too
Do not wubba me or I will wubba you
Do not wubba me or I will wubba you

Told the monster in the mirror, ""No, I am not scared""
Then I smiled at him and thanked him for the song that we had shared
Well, the monster thanked me too, he smiled right back and then
The monster in the sang his song again

He said ""Wubba wubba wubba wubba woo woo woo""
Wubba wubba wubba and a doodly do
He went ""Wubba wubba wubba"" so I sang along
Yes, wubba wubba wubba is a monster song
Wubba wubba wubba is a monster song

Wubba wubba wubba wubba woo woo woo
Wubba wubba wubba and a doodly do
He went ""Wubba wubba wubba"" and I sang along
Wubba wubba wubba wubba wubba wubba
Yes, wubba wubba wubba is a monster song
Wubba wubba wubba is a monster song

If your mirror has a monster in it, do not shout
This kind of situation does not call for freaking out
And do nothing that you would not like to see him do
'Cause that monster in the mirror he just might be you

Singing ""Wubba wubba wubba wubba woo woo woo""
Wubba wubba wubba and a doodly do
Wubba wubba wubba you can join in too
Wubba wubba wubba wubba wubba wubba
Yes, if you wubba me then I will wubba you
If you wubba me then I will wubba you

Going wubba wubba wubba is the thing to do
Everytime you wubba us we'll wubba you",The Monster in the Mirror,1995
Grover,"I was feeling low, I was kinda blue 
But that's all gone since I got something new 


[Chorus x2]
I got a new way to walk 
(Walk, walk) 
I got a new way to walk 
(Walk, walk) 
I got a new way to walk 
And my new walk suits me fine 


It's a little bit of strut and a lot of smooth 
And a little bit of bouncing fine 
My chin is up, my feet don't stall 
When I walk my walk, I walk real tall

This little piggy went to the market 
This little piggy stayed home 
This little piggy got a whole new walk 
And look at these pig feet take me home

All lined up in a wedding group
'Ere we are for a photograph
We're all dressed up in a morning suit
All trying hard not to laugh
Since the early caveman in his fur
Took a trip to Gretna Green
There's always been a photographer
To record the 'appy scene

'Old it, flash, bang, wallop, what a picture
What a picture, what a photograph
Poor old soul, blimey, what a joke
Hat blown off in a cloud of smoke
Clap 'ands, stamp yer feet

The same thing 'appened long ago
When man was in his prime
And what went on we only know
From the snaps he took at the time
When Adam and Eve in their birthday suit
Decided to get wed
As Adam was about to taste the fruit
The man with the cam'ra said

'Old it, flash, bang, wallop, what a picture
What a picture, what a photograph
Poor old Eve, there with nothing on
Face all red and 'er fig leaf gone

Or seen it in a Shakespeare play
How Juliet fell for Romeo
In the merry month of May
And as 'e climbed the orchard wall
To reach 'is lady fair
As he tumbled, she began to bawl
As he floated through the air

'Old it, flash, bang, wallop, what a picture
What a picture, what a photograph
Poor young chap, what a night 'e spent
Tights all torn and 'is rapier bent

King 'Enry the Eighth had several wives
Including Anne Boleyn
And he kept an album of their lives
With all their photos in
As Anne Boleyn was on her knees
Dressed in her very best frock
King 'Enry shouted, ""Smile, Dear, please""
As 'er 'ead rolled off the block

'Old it, flash, bang, wallop, what a picture
What a picture, what a photograph
Comes the print in a little while
Lost 'er 'ead, but she kept 'er smile

When Napoleon married Josephine
There was just the same to-do
He galloped home from the battle scene
All the way from Waterloo
And as he came from orf 'is 'orse
To the boudoir where she sat
She said to 'im, in French of course
As he took of his big cocked 'at

Grover Mitchell,"Oh, Danny boy, the pipes, the pipes are calling
From glen to glen, and down the mountain side.
The summer's gone, and all the roses falling,
It's you, it's you must go and I must bide.

But come ye back when summer's in the meadow,
Or when the valley's hushed and white with snow,
It's I'll be here in sunshine or in shadow,
Oh, Danny boy, oh Danny boy, I love you so!

But when ye come, and all the flowers are dying,
If I am dead, as dead I well may be,
You'll come and find the place where I am lying,
And kneel and say an Ave there for me.
And I shall hear, though soft you tread above me,
And all my grave will warmer, sweeter be,
For you will bend and tell me that you love me,
And I shall sleep in peace until you come to me!",Danny Boy,1990
