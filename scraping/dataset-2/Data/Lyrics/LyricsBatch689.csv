Marvin Gaye,"[TT] 
Ooo here I am alone, thinkin' aimlessly
Seein' other girls in love & wishin' it were me
If I could only find the key & make love come my way
I would trade this loneliness for true love any day

[Both] 
When love comes knockin' at my heart
I'm surely gonna let it in
When love comes knockin' at my heart
Happiness will surely begin

[TT] 
Oh darlin', 

[MG] Oh darlin'

[TT] 
Oh darlin', 

[MG] Oh darlin'

[MG] 
Emptiness is in the air & all around me gloom
As I gaze through the window of my lonely room
I hate to get up in the mornin' 'cause I know what lies ahead
Where there should be a cheerful smile, there's loneliness instead

[Both] 
When love comes knockin' at my heart
I'm surely gonna let it in
When love comes knockin' at my heart
Happiness will surely begin

[MG] 
Oh if you've never been in love, darlin'
Then you're just like me, now

[TT] 
Don't you get lonely? What am I to be?
Oh darlin', 

[MG] 
Oh darlin'

[TT] Oh darlin', 

[MG] Oh darlin'

[TT] 
Oh darlin', 

[MG] Oh darlin'

[TT] 
My heart's full of envy for the girl who lives next door
She has so many things that I've never had before

[MG] 
She possesses one thing I've never had a chance to get
That's someone to call her own & there's one thing you can bet

[Both] 
When love comes knockin' at my heart
I'm surely gonna let it in
When love comes knockin' at my heart
Happiness will surely begin

[TT] 
Oh darlin', 

[MG] Oh darlin'

[TT] 
Oh darlin', 

[MG] Oh darlin'

[TT] 
When love comes, I'm gonna let it in
Because I know I'll be happy then
Loneliness will be no more
When love comes, gonna open that door
When love comes, when love comes
Oh darlin', when love comes",When Love Comes Knocking at My Heart,1968
Marvin Gaye,"I was oh, so blue till you came along
Just to make my life a wonderful song
You brought sunshine just to brighten my loneliness
Is it any wonder in my happiness
I confess

Do I want you
Oh my, do I?
Honey, 'deed I do
Do I need you?
Oh my, do I
Honey, 'deed I do

That's why I'm always hangin' 'round you
Do I love you?
Oh my, do I?
Honey, 'deed I do

Marvin Gaye,"Ooh, everyday, there's something new (oh, baby)
Honey, to keep me loving you (oh, honey)
And with every passing minute
Oh baby, so much joy wrapped up in it (sugar)
Oh, heaven must have sent you from above
Oh, heaven must have sent your precious love

Oh, and now, I've got a song to sing
Tellin' the world about the joy you bring (sweetheart)
And you gave me reason for living
And ooh, you taught me
You taught me the meaning of giving

Oh-oh, heaven must have sent you from above
Oh, heaven must have sent your precious love, oh
To find a love like yours is rare these days
'Cause you've shown me what happiness is in so many ways
I look in the mirror and I'm glad to see
Laughter in the eyes where tears used to be

What you've given me I could never return (baby)
'Cause there's so much, girl, I've yet to learn
And I want to show my appreciation
'Cause when I found you
I found a new inspiration

Oh-oh, heaven must have sent you from above
Oh, heaven must have sent your precious love
Oh-oh, heaven must have sent you from above
Oh, heaven must have sent your precious love",Your Precious Love [Single Version],1969

Think about me here
Here in misery

Sugar, how can you treat my heart
So mean and cruel
Sugar, sugar

I treasure every like it was a precious jewel

Somethin' I wanna say
When you left
You took all of me with you
Do you wanna hear me scream
Please please oh please baby
Come back and hold me, girl",Distant Lover [Alternate Mix][#],1973

But I must like you like that
Although you won't let me control this or that
Constantly playin' this tit for tat

Ah now I see you're comin' straight to the point
You say the more you get baby
Ah the more you want me
Yeah darlin' you're not wastin' my time
What I see baby is so hard to find

Although you've been all over town baby
Havin' your affairs I still have to accept you back
Angel though you're promiscuous
I don't mind a bit 'cause you're still the greatest lay
Even when you're miles away

Girl if you run away again
Surely my heart would never mend
Don't tell me the love we made
Was just for old time's sake
Stayin' up waitin' for you to come home at night
Was just so hard to take
She said that pain might never mend
So let's be sometime lovers and
Oh baby that's when my poor heart broke up

So if you got a girl and you want her for your wife
You got to treat her good and love her all your life
Well if you got a girl and you want her for your wife
You got to treat her good and love her all your life
If you got a girl and you want her for your wife
You got to treat her good and love her all your life
If you got a girl and you want her for your wife
You got to treat her good and love her all your life
Well if you got a girl and you want her for your wife
You got to treat her good and love her all your life

Pretty little thing just about blew my mind.
She took me home, and, ahh, made love to me.
I knew right then and there, this is where I wanted to be.
Most of my life I had been all, all alone,
And you're so sweet to me; don't think I'll ever roam.
And then one day as time will pass,
I had this feeling that our love would last.
Nothing could go wrong, and it seemed everything I did 
Seemed to please you; all the heartaches you hid.
Then one night after we made it, and we were through,
That's when I decided I wanted to marry you.
Do you take this woman to be your lawful wedded wife;
To love, hold, and cherish, for the rest of your life?
I do, yes I do, I do darlin',
Cause I love you.
Nineteen sixty-four.
Once you really loved me,
Once I really loved you.
Nineteen seventy-six.
Then time would change you ,
As time would really change me.
We thought our love would stand the test of time,
And, as I sing this song, right now, I wonder today, today,
If you're a friend of mine.
Cry, cry, cry, I have done some crying.
Woman, you have caused my tears to flow.
Cry, cry, cried; you cry about me?
Do you think about the kind of love we had?

You know you had a brother who thought he was cool

Sing while you're here, sing a song, my dear
Let me hear your song, do you mean to call
Sing, little sparrow, sing
Want you to sing, little sparrow, sing
I want you to sing, little sparrow, sing
A pretty bird song

Sing to me, let me hear your agony
Did you see me sucking up the lay?
Sing to me of peace and love
Sing to me of God and love
Sing sparrow, oh sparrow, sing

Sing to me about man's inhumanity
And all the injustice you see
Sing sparrow, sing, little sparrow, sing
Sing about what to give
Sing about about how to live
I want you to sing your tune sparrow
Oh, little sparrow, sing

Sing to me of jealousy
Aww, sing what that's all about
Sing it all out, shout, little sparrow
Aww, sing at me
Sing me a, sing me a song
I wanna know what's wrong, little bird, tell me
Aww, sparrow

Sing sparrow 'cause I wanna know
You sweet, itty, bitty, pretty bird
Sing before you go
Sing to me, Marvin Gaye before you fly away
Never stop singing sparrow till we hear your song

Sing your song
Sing your song
On and on and on and on
On and on and on and on and
I remember a bird",Sparrow [Alternate Version],1978
Marvin Gaye,"I remember like it was yesterday
We were over Gwen's,and we were trying one more time to make amends
Oh yes we were
Suddenly it occurred to me it did not matter
Whether I was mad at her
Or she was at me
Nawww understanding my condition I must surely be a wishing and a hoping to be free

Chorus

She said... You can leave, but it's going to cost you ....
She said... You can leave,but it's going to cost you.
..
She said ... you can lea..ve, but it's gonna cost you dearly
You....can leave but it gonna cost you how dearly
Ooohhhhhhhhh
Sometimes my eyes were red as fire
Intoxicated ...

Sometimes the spirit was moving on me
I had to fight to defend my life




I'm gone,I'm gone,I'm gone(get use to it baby)
I'm gone,I', gone,I'm gone(get use to it baby)


You use to say that I was a gorgeous hunk of man...
That didn't help me baby Ah...when you were on the stand




","You Can Leave, But It's Going to Cost You",1978
Marvin Gaye,"You know, when you say your marriage vows
They´re supposed to be for real
I mean...
If you think back about what you really said
You know, about, honor and loving 
And obeying till death do us part and all 
But it shouldn´t be that way, it should... 
It should, it shouldn´t be lies because it turns out to be lies 
If you don´t honor what you said, you lie to God 
The words should be changed

Ooo now as I recall, we tried a million times
Again and again and again, and that isn´t all
I gave my love to you each time to make amends
Suddenly I start to realize I can´t make it
Pretty birds fly away, I had to leave you for my health´s sake
What to do? Make you pay, for leaving you, my fine, is to pay forever
So if a fresh new love comes in, I won´t say those words again
Instead I´ll say I´ll try to love and protect you
With all my heart as long as you want me to baby

Ooo if I love again I´m gonna try a new way this time
Memories of the things we did, some we´re proud of, some we hid
So when two people have to part, sometimes it makes them stronger
Do you remember all of the bullshit, baby?
You say you love me with all your heart
If you ever loved me will all of your heart
You´d never take a million dollars to part
I really tried, you know I tried, oh baby
Although we tried, all of those promises was nothin´ but lies
I really tried, you know how I really tried, we really lied, didn´t we baby?
And on top of that you have scandalized my name
What I can´t understand is if you love me
How could you turn me into the police?
Didn´t I love you good and try to take care of you?
Best that I could
You were so divine
And your love was like mellow wine
Pains of love, miles of tears, 
Enough to last me for my lifetime
Broken hearts last for years, soon break away to the noonday sunshine
One thing I can promise, friend, I´ll never be back again
But I´m not really bitter babe
I wish you all the luck and all the love in the world, 
Good love in the world (good luck in the world)
But I know you´ll never be satisfied
No, you still want me standin´ by your side

Memories haunt you all the time, I will never leave your mind
Got judgement on your side,
You´ve said bad things and you´ve lied
Still I remember some of the good things baby
Like love after dark and picnics in parks
Those are the days I´ll not forget in my life
I´d rather remember, remember the joy we shared babe
I´d rather remember all the fun we had
All I ever really wanted was to love you and treat you right
All we did was fuss and fight
It don´t matter baby, take a lesson from them all
I never thought I´d see the day 
When you´d put me through what you put me through
You tried your best, you say I gave you no rest

When did you stop loving me? When did I stop loving you?","When Did You Stop Loving Me, When Did I Stop Loving You [Leon Ware & Ge",1978
Marvin Gaye,"When did you love me
I want to know the truth
It's never hard to get it up for you
Why did you have it and is it all the same

Oh my sweet darling did you forget your name
oh you call it a thrill
I never knew, and then you never will
Oh one big mistake now I see

I started off thinking that you belonged to me
Cold blooded lovers waiting for the night
Exploring my treasure, got me so uptight
Your fault that I'm

Feeling all insane
Once we were happy
And then the devil came
Oh baby, oh baby

First you make believe your mine
Oh babe, oh baby
Then you make me feel like dying. Ooh ooh
Once upon a time you said I set your soul on fire

I called you my honey
You were my one desire
I let you nestle too deep within my soul
I can't believe I let you take control

Oh my sweet baby don't wait too late
Tell me you love me and cure my heart ache
I never thought I'd be put in this squeeze
Your trying to bring me to my bended knee

Don't start buggin'
Don't criticize
Folks that love you
Right before your eyes

You stopped me
Got to let you go
Got to be heard
Got to love you so

Got to give you some
Just before you leave
Got to feed my fire

Uh ah, uh ah
Ok let me hear that back
C'mon ya'll lets go

Come on sweet darlin' you say you don't care
Dance all your heart aches far away from here
You used to be so real
Ah I used to be your only thrill baby

Ah it used to be so real
You never loved me and you never will
But I'll always love you cause that's the way I feel
And we just can't help it cause that's the way it is

So let's be happy
Fly 'n be happy
Love 'n be happy
Dance, whooooo

Oh let's be happy
Let's laugh 'n be happy
Let's live 'n be happy

And love is happy
To sing is happy

Keep on rising higher baby and you'll stay happy
Gotta stay happy

I know its your thing
Every time I see you you are awful clean you got your rings generally
Y'know
Flash the cash is what I need
I can understand it

I got the baddest cool, could never be the fool, the ladies wait to get down with me
The love I make superb, to doubt me is absurd, the ladies say I'm the greatest you see
I want to have your spot, and more than what you got, I bought the baddest house I could find
All it must be said I'm greatest in the bed and when I love a lady she's mine
I know I'm really hot, my diamonds shine a lot, check out here this 450 SE babe
I'm what's its all about

Ego tripping out (tripping out, tripping out, your tripping out, your tripping out)
Ahh ha hey hey

Without a doubt, I know we ego tripping out, sometimes it's a shame
But it caused so much pain, don't want you baby
I know you ego tripping out, 'times it's a shame but it can't do without
Without a doubt, I know your ego tripping out, hey she don't know it
Ain't it a shame all the pain to come

I'm better than the rest, check out the way I dress and got a lot of money to spend
The best club in town, is where I get down, your lucky if I choose you my friend
Walk the greatest walk, I got to be the talk, I've got the greatest show in town
Woo hoo rock with other men then roll over to me so I can trill your soul baby
Aw check out the love mink standing tall in bold can fulfill your needs into the cold baby
Needless to say I'm your greatest play
Ego tripping out, oh, ego tripping out,
Yeah, ego tripping out

In my mind what it's for
Got a sweet tooth for the chick on the floor
Walking in my shoes
Walking to the beat
Still got some love inside
Some good old body heat

Oh baby
Spread the news
Only here to deepen my soul
No it ain't about money

Turn the fear into energy
'Cause the toot and the smoke
Won't fulfill the need
Only one way, only one way

The world is not for long, baby
There's only time for singing and praying
And having a love party

You've got to check out the times, baby
'Cause what we need is a love explosion
We don't have no time to waste
Got to pray, whoo

Baby, your life and mine is grooving on the danger
Revelations prophecy's nearly fulfilled
We are blessed to experience a changing world
So let's love before our fate is closed and sealed

You've got to understand, baby

The world is not for long

On the birdies and the bees
And the flowers and the trees
And the fishes in the rivers
And on all the things He give us

On your body in His image
And your power with no limits
On your heart and your soul
And your purpose and your goals

On your reasons and your rhymes
And your seasons and your times
On your family and your Bible
And your knowledge of survival

Meditation deep within
That's the way it begins
Baby, it begins
Baby, it begins
(Oh yeah)

To me you're really extra special mellow, baby
Oh, and the thrill I feel is real and oh so good, baby
So when you say you love me, I believe you, baby
And it's good to party, fun to party with you, baby

To me you're extra special mellow, baby
And the thrill I feel is real and oh so good, baby
Mmm, so when the party's over
Let's go create some loving, baby

Whoa, no time, baby
(Got to pray and meditate)
Fooling around, let there be peace and love
(Got to pray and meditate)

Oh baby, come here, come here, come here, darling
Oh, we need love
(Got to pray and meditate)
Love explosion, oh darling

Mmm, come here, come here, come here, baby

I want to have your spot, and more than what you got, I bought the baddest house I could find

I know you ego tripping out, 'times it's a shame but it can't do without
Without a doubt, I know your ego tripping out, hey she don't know it
Ain't it a shame all the pain to come

I'm better than the rest, check out the way I dress and got a lot of money to spend
The best club in town, is where I get down, your lucky if I choose you my friend
Walk the greatest walk, I got to be the talk, I've got the greatest show in town
Woo hoo rock with other men then roll over to me so I can fill your soul baby
Aw check out the love mink standing tall in bold can fulfill your needs into the cold baby
Needless to say I'm your greatest play
Ego tripping out, oh, ego tripping out,
Yeah, ego tripping out

Diana Ross
(P. Sawyer/G. Jones)

My mistake was to love you, girl
Love you, girl
My mistake was to give you all
Tell the world

First I had you
In the palm of my hand
But I let you slip through
Like rain to sand
At the beginning
When I didn't care
Like my own reflection
You were always there

My mistake was to love you, girl
Love you, girl
My mistake was to give you all
Tell the world

You were sweeter
Then my very own skin
But what did I do for you
Not a thing
In front of my friends
You broke me down
Since then darling
It's hard to track you down

My mistake was to love you, boy
Love you, boy
My mistake was to give my all
Tell the world

Many a smile
You put om ny face
But I paid dearly
With the tears I taste

My tenderness
Made you cold, not sweet
'Cause if a girl loves you
You only call her weak

My mistake was to love you, boy
Love you, boy

I realize it's just a picture inside a frame.

I read your letters when you're not near me,
But they don't move me, and they don't groove me
Like when I hear your sweet voice whispering in my ear.
I play the game, a fantasy.
I pretend I'm not in reality.
I need the shelter of your arms to comfort me.

I got some memories to look back on
And though they help me when you're gone,

No touch can do half as much to make me feel better,

Quote from every poem I've read
Sing each I've song that I've ever heard to you

But there's one thing I'd do better
If I had a voice instead
And the part of me that holds my love for you

If my heart could sing
I'd sing a song that all the world could feel
One that each word a thought would bring
If my heart could sing, sing

I'd sing of love to tell my story
A how love brought me you
And like a bell I'd toll and ring
If my heart could sing

There are things I'd like to tell you
Things I'd felt along the way
But my lips can't speak the magic words
That my heart alone can say

Oh, I'd prove to you I'll always love you
Girl, I will, till the end of time
I'll make you today eternal spring

Cause rain-drops will hide my tear -drops

All my troubles seemed so far away
Now, I need a place to hide away
Oh, I, I believe in yesterday

Suddenly
People I ain't half the man I used to be, no
There's a heavy, heavy shadow hanging over me
Yesterday, came all too suddenly

Oh, why did she have to go?
I don't know
Tell you, I don't know
The little girl wouldn't say

I must have, must have said something wrong
Now I long, long, long for yesterday

Oh, talkin' about yesterday
Love, love, love was such an easy game to play
Now I need a place to hide away
Lord I, I believe now, in yesterday, oh

Well I must have said something wrong

Marvin Gaye,"Flying high in the friendly sky
Without leaving the ground
Rest of the folks are tired and weary
And have laid their bodies down
I go to the place where danger waits
And its bound to forsake me

So stupid minded
But I go crazy, when I cant find it

In the morning I'll be alright my friends
Soon the night will bring the pains again

Flying high in the friendly sky
Without ever leaving the ground
Ain't seen nothing but trouble baby paraphernalia is my name
There's a place where the feeling awaits me
Self-destructions in my hands

So stupid minded
But I go crazy, when I can find it

I know I'm hooked my friends
To the boy
Who makes slaves out of men

Ahhh yeah

I did the best I could
Nobody understood

I did the best I could
Nobody understood (take way, take me away)
I did the best I could

Stand by you like a tree, dare anybody to try and move me

Strength where I was torn down

Just to do what's good for you and inspire you a little higher
I know you can make a man out of a soul that didn't have a goal
'Cause we, we got the right foundation and with love and determination

Is it right to be left alone
When the one you love is never home

Took to find it out all night I been cryin'

And there's no love left (there's no love left)

Hey, don't know why I failed
For you I've always cared
I did all I know to win your love and make it so
Always stay but you turned away

How could you, how could you, how could you do me this way?

Gonna make it right, baby (gonna make it right, baby)

Marvin Gaye,"I used to go out to parties
And stand around
'Cause I was too nervous
To really get down

But my body yearned to be free
I got up on the floor and found
Someone to choose me

No more standin' along the side walls
Now I've got myself together, baby
And I'm havin' a ball
Long as you prove it
There's always a chance
Somebody watches
Might wanna make romance

Move your body, ooo baby, you dance all night
To the groove and feel all right
Everybody's groovin' on like a fool
But if you see me, top down, let me in
Baby just party high and low
Let me step into your erotic zone

Move it up
Turn it 'round
Ooo shake it down
Owwww

You can love me when you want to babe
This is such a groovy party baby
We're here face to face
Everybody's swingin'
This is such a groovy place
All the young ladies are so fine!
You're movin your body easy with no doubts
I know what you thinkin' baby
You wanna turn me out
Think I'm gonna let you do it babe

Keep on dancin'
Got to give it up
Keep on dancin'
Got to give it up
Keep on dancin'
Got to give it up
Keep on dancin'
Got to give it up

Marvin Gaye,"I guess I'd have to say this album is
Dedicated to you.
Although perhaps you may not be happy,
This is what you want,
So I conceded.
I hope it makes you happy.
There's a lot of truth in it, babe.

I don't think I'll have many regrets, baby.
Things didn't have to be the way they was, baby.
You don't have the right to use the son of mine
To keep me in line.
One thing I can't do without
Is the boy whom God gave to both of us.
I'm so happy, oh, for the son of mine.

So here it is, babe.
I hope you enjoy, reminisce, be happy,
Think about the kisses and the joy.
But there were those other moments too,
The times that were cloudy and grey.
Bad.
But you taught me that was life.
May love ever protect you,
May peace come into your life.
Always think of me the way I was.
Ha, I was your baby.

This is what you wanted.
Here, dear, here it is.
Here, my dear, here it is.","Here, My Dear",1995

Well, well, well, little darling
Where can you be

Maybe I'll awake and find that I'm mistaken

You've been traveling but will it last
While I'm traveling nowhere fast

Good songs were sent to men from God
Help us pass the test

Life is for learning
And the purpose is joinin' up
With the love of thousand bodies needed
But your soul is never destroyed

Your love, darling, this is all we desire
And all they want is a little understanding, yeah
Sometimes a song can prophesize a warning from the Master
To make your soul listen to, make your learnin' faster

To make hot songs for sinners
Thank God we'll turn it around
And make good songs for winners

Marvin Gaye,"You know, when you say your marriage vows
They're supposed to be for real
I mean
If you think back about what you really said
You know, about, honor and loving
And obeying 'till death do us part and all
But it shouldn't be that way, it should
It should, it shouldn't be lies because it turns out to be lies
If you don't honor what you said, you lie to God
The words should be changed

Ooo now as I recall, we tried a million times
Again and again and again, and that isn't all
I gave my love to you each time to make amends
Suddenly I start to realize I can´t make it
Pretty birds fly away, I had to leave you for my health's sake
What to do? Make you pay, for leaving you, my fine, is to pay forever
So if a fresh new love comes in, I won´t say those words again
Instead I'll say I'll try to love and protect you
With all my heart as long as you want me to baby

Ooo if I love again I´m gonna try a new way this time
Memories of the things we did, some we´re proud of, some we hid
So when two people have to part, sometimes it makes them stronger
Do you remember all of the bullshit, baby?
You say you love me with all your heart
If you ever loved me will all of your heart
You'd never take a million dollars to part
I really tried, you know I tried, oh baby
Although we tried, all of those promises was nothin' but lies
I really tried, you know how I really tried, we really lied, didn't we baby?
And on top of that you have scandalized my name
What I can´t understand is if you love me
How could you turn me into the police?
Didn't I love you good and try to take care of you?
Best that I could
You were so divine
And your love was like mellow wine
Pains of love, miles of tears,
Enough to last me for my lifetime
Broken hearts last for years, soon break away to the noonday sunshine
One thing I can promise, friend, I'll never be back again
But I´m not really bitter babe
I wish you all the luck and all the love in the world
Good love in the world (good luck in the world)
But I know you´ll never be satisfied
No, you still want me standin' by your side

Memories haunt you all the time, I will never leave your mind
Got judgement on your side,
You've said bad things and you've lied
Still I remember some of the good things baby
Like love after dark and picnics in parks
Those are the days I'll not forget in my life
I'd rather remember, remember the joy we shared babe
I'd rather remember all the fun we had
All I ever really wanted was to love you and treat you right
All we did was fuss and fight
It don't matter baby, take a lesson from them all
I never thought I'd see the day
When you´d put me through what you put me through
You tried your best, you say I gave you no rest

Marvin Gaye,"You know, when you say your marriage vows
They´re supposed to be for real
I mean...
If you think back about what you really said
You know, about, honor and loving 
And obeying till death do us part and all 
But it shouldn´t be that way, it should... 
It should, it shouldn´t be lies because it turns out to be lies 
If you don´t honor what you said, you lie to God 
The words should be changed

Ooo now as I recall, we tried a million times
Again and again and again, and that isn´t all
I gave my love to you each time to make amends
Suddenly I start to realize I can´t make it
Pretty birds fly away, I had to leave you for my health´s sake
What to do? Make you pay, for leaving you, my fine, is to pay forever
So if a fresh new love comes in, I won´t say those words again
Instead I´ll say I´ll try to love and protect you
With all my heart as long as you want me to baby

Ooo if I love again I´m gonna try a new way this time
Memories of the things we did, some we´re proud of, some we hid
So when two people have to part, sometimes it makes them stronger
Do you remember all of the bullshit, baby?
You say you love me with all your heart
If you ever loved me will all of your heart
You´d never take a million dollars to part
I really tried, you know I tried, oh baby
Although we tried, all of those promises was nothin´ but lies
I really tried, you know how I really tried, we really lied, didn´t we baby?
And on top of that you have scandalized my name
What I can´t understand is if you love me
How could you turn me into the police?
Didn´t I love you good and try to take care of you?
Best that I could
You were so divine
And your love was like mellow wine
Pains of love, miles of tears, 
Enough to last me for my lifetime
Broken hearts last for years, soon break away to the noonday sunshine
One thing I can promise, friend, I´ll never be back again
But I´m not really bitter babe
I wish you all the luck and all the love in the world, 
Good love in the world (good luck in the world)
But I know you´ll never be satisfied
No, you still want me standin´ by your side

Memories haunt you all the time, I will never leave your mind
Got judgement on your side,
You´ve said bad things and you´ve lied
Still I remember some of the good things baby
Like love after dark and picnics in parks
Those are the days I´ll not forget in my life
I´d rather remember, remember the joy we shared babe
I´d rather remember all the fun we had
All I ever really wanted was to love you and treat you right
All we did was fuss and fight
It don´t matter baby, take a lesson from them all
I never thought I´d see the day 
When you´d put me through what you put me through
You tried your best, you say I gave you no rest

When did you stop loving me? When did I stop loving you?",Got to Give It Up (Part 1),1997
Marvin Gaye,"Lady luck shows my love me
Oh, when she blessed me with your loving charms
I've found my place in the sun
With heaven right here in your arms

I feel so lucky, so lucky baby
Oh, lucky to be loved by you
And I wanna thank you, thank you baby
For all the little loving things you do

I got to tell the world about it
I've got to stand right up and shout it
Hey, look at lucky me

Ooh baby, ooh baby

I don't mind stormy weather
The rain no longer makes me blue
And I don't care when my friends all get together
And leave me out of everything they do

It's alright if the sun don't shine
It's impossible to darken my day
Makes no difference if I don't have a dime
I'll be wealthy anyway

Mmm, I'm no good without you
But listen baby, as long as I got you
Hey, look at lucky me, hey, ooh baby

In my life, there's no misfortune
No struggle or strife today
You're my lucky charm, my guiding star
So just smile and chase them blues away

I can't help it baby, you're so wonderful
Oh, how lucky can a-one man be
Oh, your tenderness and sweet caress
And it all belongs to me

I wanna tell the world about it
I wanna stand right up and shout it
Hey, look at lucky me

I pretend I'm not in reality.
I need the shelter of your arms to comfort me.

And this old empty heart of mine is in despair

Washed the words away
I could still remember every word you had to say

A very sad wedding
And the tears came tumblin' from my eyes

We fell in love
First day we met
Then later on we were wed
And as we stood there
Greeting all our friends
Here's what I heard somebody say

It was a sad wedding
Oh, how I cried
Oh, how beautiful was the bride
It was a sad wedding
A very sad wedding
And the tears came tumblin' from my eyes

I was so nervous, I just couldn't wait
To see you walk down the aisle
Then suddenly there was music, and all my fear was gone
And you came walking with a smile

We had our reception
Then we were on our way
Off to our honeymoon
When you threw your bouquet
And rice flew over our heads
I overheard somebody say

It was a sad wedding
Oh, how I cried
Oh, how beautiful was the bride

The change that's come over me
Because a smile upon my face
Is something rare for them to see
But how can I tell someone else
What I don't understand myself?
It's like walking into the sunshine
Out of the glow, and oh baby

It's just a satisfied feeling,
Oh yeah, down in my soul
Imagine something so strong
That keeps the world from doing you wrong
It gives you power, it gives you drums
And there ain't nothing you can't overcome
Like a puzzle when the pieces fit
I know that this is it
It's like watching a brand new day
Begin to glow, and oh baby

Just a satisfied feeling
Down in my soul
And I don't know what
It is about you
But I can't stand the thought
Of ever ever being without you
So I'm going to love you
And never let you out of my sight
'Cause the way you make me feel
Has got to be right

Burning within
And I know people can see it from afar
And it gives you a special something

And inside me is a growing need for your embrace
In the light of day, though our faces meet
Someone there might see someone else speak
Till the dark of night, while the moon is new
While we whisper words of love in our secret rendezvous
Somethin's wrong I know, girl I love you so
Yes I need you, I need you baby
Oh you, my sweetest joy
You can afford the best of life
I'm just a heartbreakin' boy
Oh you've given your love to me
Girl, I can't let you hurt yourself by being seen with me
We're worlds apart, so close yet very far
So we must hide the love we're feelin' in our hearts
We meet in shadows, your friends must never know
That we are lovers, darlin'
Although it hurts me so, for your sake no one must see
The press of love you're givin' me
But you know, I need you baby

One day I'll make the break, my love will start to shine
I can tell the world that you are mine, all mine
Till then we must go on the way we have before
And never let it show without each other's souls

I could sit a drink on that ass if I had nowhere to place it
Face it, how could anybody dislike you?
These others girl are cool, but not quite like you

Marvin Gaye,"Childhood part of my life, it wasn't very pretty.
You see, I was born and raised in the slums of the city,
It was a one room shack that slept ten other children besides me.
We hardly had enough food or room to sleep.
It was hard times,
Needed something to ease my troubled mind.
Listen!  my father didn't know the meaning of work,
He disrespected mama, and treated us like dirt.
I left home, seekin' a job that I never did find,
Depressed and downhearted I took to cloud nine,
I'm doin' fine, up here on cloud nine.
Listen one more time I'm doin' fine, up here on cloud nine.
Folks down there tell me,
They say, ""give yourself a chance son, don't let life pass you by"".
But the world of reality is a rat race where only the strongest survive,
It's a dog eat dog world, and that ain't no lie.
Listen!  it ain't even safe no more to walk the streets at night,
I'm doin' fine, on cloud nine.
Let me tell you about cloud nine.

Cloud nine, you can be what you wanna be
(cloud nine) you ain't got no responsibility,
And ev'ry man, ev'ry man is free
(cloud nine)  and you're a million miles from reality.
I wanna say I love the life I live,
And I'm gonna live the life I love up here on cloud nine.
I'm riding high
On cloud nine, you're as free as a bird in flight
(cloud nine)  there's no diff'rence between day and night
(cloud nine)  it's a world of love and harmony
(cloud nine)  you're a million miles from reality.

Cloud nine, you can be what you wanna be

Marvin Gaye,"Hey homeboy how come everywhere you go you have to go by limousine man

Hey man that's my thing

I know its your thing
Every time I see you you are awful clean you got your rings generally
Y'know
Flash the cash is what I need
I can understand it

I got the baddest cool, could never be the fool, the ladies wait to get down with me
The love I make superb, to doubt me is absurd, the ladies say I'm the greatest you see
I want to have your spot, and more than what you got, I bought the baddest house I could find
All it must be said I'm greatest in the bed and when I love a lady she's mine
I know I'm really hot, my diamonds shine a lot, check out here this 450 SE babe
I'm what's its all about

Ego tripping out (tripping out, tripping out, your tripping out, your tripping out)
Ahh ha hey hey

Without a doubt, I know we ego tripping out, sometimes it's a shame
But it caused so much pain, don't want you baby
I know you ego tripping out, 'times it's a shame but it can't do without
Without a doubt, I know your ego tripping out, hey she don't know it
Ain't it a shame all the pain to come

I'm better than the rest, check out the way I dress and got a lot of money to spend
The best club in town, is where I get down, your lucky if I choose you my friend
Walk the greatest walk, I got to be the talk, I've got the greatest show in town
Woo hoo rock with other men then roll over to me so I can trill your soul baby
Aw check out the love mink standing tall in bold can fulfill your needs into the cold baby
Needless to say I'm your greatest play
Ego tripping out, oh, ego tripping out,
Yeah, ego tripping out

In my mind what it's for
Got a sweet tooth for the chick on the floor
Walking in my shoes
Walking to the beat
Still got some love inside
Some good old body heat

Oh baby
Spread the news
Only here to deepen my soul
No it ain't about money

Turn the fear into energy
'Cause the toot and the smoke
Won't fulfill the need
Only one way, only one way
Feel the feeling, energy of a kiss",Ego Tripping Out [*],2004

How sweet it is to be loved by you

I needed the shelter of someone's arms and there you were
I needed someone to understand my ups and downs

I close my eyes at night, 
Wondering where would I be without you in my life 
Everything I did was just a bore, 
Everywhere I went it seems I'd been there before
But you brightened up for me all of my days
With a love so sweet in so many ways
I want to stop and thank you baby
I want to stop and thank you baby

First I had you
In the palm of my hand
But I let you slip through
Like rain to sand
At the beginning
When I didn't care
Like my own reflection
You were always there

My mistake was to love you, girl

Then my very own skin
But what did I do for you
Not a thing
In front of my friends
You broke me down

Love you, boy
My mistake was to give my all

Made you cold, not sweet

You only call her weak

She's my little Georgia rose

Her mother left her with another
A carefree life she had planned
The baby now she is a lady
The one her mother couldn't stand

We often sing those songs together
I watched her do her little part
She smiled at me when I would tell her
That she was my sweetheart",Georgia Rose [Live][#],2005

Marvin Gaye,"I hear music when I look at you,
A beautiful theme of every
Dream I ever knew.
Down deep in my heart I hear it play.
I feel it start, then melt away.

I hear music when I touch your hand,
A beautiful melody
From some enchanted land.
Down deep in my heart, I hear it say,
Is this the day?

I alone have heard this lovely strain,
I alone have heard this glad refrain,
Must it be forever inside of me,
Why can't I let it go,
Why can't I let you know,
Why can't I let you know the song
My heart would sing?

Of love and youth and spring,

The words are true 
The song is you.",The Song Is You [Live][#],2005

Wandering the night, 
What were the chances
We'd be sharing love
Before the night was through

Something in your eyes
Was so inviting
Something in your smile
Was so exciting
Something in my heart
Told me I must have you

Strangers in the night
Two lonely people
We were strangers in the night
Up to the moment 
When we said our first hello
Little did we know
Love was just a glance away
A warm embracing dance away

And ever since that night 
We've been together
Lovers at first sight
In love forever
It turned out so right

Strangers in the night

That this ain't the way love's supposed to be
Let me hear, let me hear you say yeah, yeah

Up early in the morning with her on my mind
Just to find out all night that I've been cryin'
But I believe a woman's a man's best friend
So I'm gonna stick by her till the very end

That I forget how love is supposed to be

I pretend but I'm not in reality
I need the shelter of your arms to comfort me

No other sound is quite the same as your name
No touch can do half as much to make me feel better
So let's stay together

I got some memories to look back on
And though they help me when you phone
I'm well aware nothing can take the place of being there

Sexual healing is something that's good for me
And it's good for me and it's good to me

The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright

Of paradise, where roses grew

Marvin Jones Trio,"You don't know what love is
'Til you've learned the meaning of the blues
Until you've loved a love you've had  to lose,
You don't know what love  is.

You don't know how lips hurt
Until you've kissed and had to pay the cost,
Until you've flipped your heart and you have lost,
You don't know what love is.

Do you know how a lost heart fears
At the thought of reminiscing,
And how lips that taste of tears
Lose their taste for kissing?
You don't know how hearts burn
For love that can, not live yet never dies.
Until you've faced each dawn with sleepless eyes,
You don't know what love is.",You Don't Know What Love Is,2007

‘Va, vis mais reviens’

que le tien c’est le mien
qu’à nous deux on ne fait qu’un.

J’ai cru Bruxelles plus belle et ma peine capitale

j’étais perdu dans l’aversion du t’aime

sans clim’, sans doutes 

Est-ce Berlin Est  les douces soirées d’Août ?  Ou est-ce d’être si loin de l’Ouest  qui congédia mes doutes ?

si loin de la mer qu’on se noua

comme dépassés par le présent
On a écrit au futur sur les murs  cru au cristal, aux bonnes aventures

On se demandera sans cesse  si nos desseins d’enfant
s’affichent à Berlin Est et s’effacent en rentrant

Etre prisonnier de l’oreiller.
Chuter, tomber puis me cogner,
Dans le cadre du lit, me réveiller ;
Allumer la lampe à mon chevet,
Pousser d’un geste le cendrier.
Sentir le frais me rhabiller,
Poser mes pieds sur le parquet.

D’ici deux heures, tout sera éteint.
Dix pour la grande, la petite près du un.
Dis si tu veux, que c’est lâche, que c’est chien.
Dis si tu peux, que là où j’erre, je vais bien.

J’aimerais tant rester,
Etre passionné par ces contrées,
Lutter, y croire, ne pas connaitre la vérité ;
T’écrire cette lettre sans la gommer.
Ravir tes souvenirs puis m’effacer,
Teinter mes restes et leur fumée,
Essuyer ma peine sur le plancher.

Je vois les pieds du brancardier.

I started out a long, long, long time ago
But my journey held most things I did not know
But I was sure and believed the plan You gave
Was so secure inside of me

In latter days I found failure down
And complacency came to pull me down
They wrestled deep inside of me, now the passion's gone
Staring me right in the face, asking me if I am sure

Now when I need strength to endure
There's one thing that I can count on
To help me make it through
I anoint myself

I anoint myself, bring my mind back
And talk to the Father, yeah, plan again
Keep the love, that I gotta do
'Cause I'm here to serve You

My heart it says, it's not too late
Before I waste another day
Kneel and pray
This is how I remind myself

Now my savior's gone, it seems like I have it down
I've stood through it all, it feels still to rise and come around
Trying to guarantee this day I'm going forward
And the battle starts all over again

Now when I need to know for sure
There's one thing that I can count on
To help me make it through
I anoint myself

I anoint myself, bring my mind back
And talk to the Father, yeah, plan again
Keep in my heart what I gotta do
'Cause I'm here to serve You

My heart it says, it's not too late
Before I waste another day
Kneel and pray
This is how I remind myself

Sometimes in this world, challenges come
And emotions get carried away
But in faith be strong and to His word hold on
And when if doubt comes, guard up yourself
Stand there and say I remember

Sometimes gotta remind myself
What I've been called to do
Is first to be with you

Sometimes I gotta remember, oh yeah
That you called me, Lord
Yes, you did and I'm at your disposal

Sometimes gotta remind myself
What I've been called to do
Is first to be with you

Sometimes, gotta remind myself
That you called me, called me
And I'm at your disposal

I anoint myself, bring my mind back
And talk to the Father, yeah, plan again
Keep in my heart what I gotta do
'Cause I'm here to serve You

My heart it says, it's not too late
Before I waste another day

Is from too high expectations

Like a song needs a tune

Or if they get high place employment
Not knowing they?re building hopes and dreams on sand
They soon are disappointed (disappointed)

And like the harvest depends on the time
Like the tide needs the moon

For every word is true
That?s why I?m trusting in You

And I'd make believe I was under a teepee

And it wasn't very long till I told her how
The love in my heart burned

Twas then he said I could never take

And a brave called Yellow Sun scalped my little boy

And the melody that He sends to me
Within my heart is still ringing

This is a song about a young lady that was once in my life
Here's my story
Listen

I left home early
I came back very late
I saw my front door closing
As I approached the gate

I said who could it be
I know my baby is still asleep
Besides, he looks so short
And she's so tall

So I went in the house
And saw my baby laying there
And she was washed in sweat
From her head to her toes

And she said
I was dreaming
That I was making sweet love to you
And it was good
It was so good

She said dreaming
She said I never had a dream like this before
I wanna have it again

Tears filled my eyes
Because I knew the reason why
My baby wanted to have that same dream again
But what could I say, nothing
Tell me what could I do about it, nothing
Because I know I'm doing the same thing to, making love

I wonder how would she feel
If she ever finds out
That I just left the motel too

And I was dreaming
That I was making sweet love to her
And it was good
It was so good

Dreaming

How could she made me feel

Beware my foolish heart
How white the ever constant moon
Take care my foolish heart

There's a line between love and fascination
That's hard to see, how many names such as this
For they both have the very same sensation
When you're locked in the magic of a kiss

Her lips are much too close to mine
Beware my foolish heart
But should our eager lips combine
Then let the fire start

For this time it isn't fascination
Or a dream that will fade and fall apart
It's love, this time it's love

"Marvin, Welch & Farrar","Butterflies danced on invisible strings
Showing wings they borrowed from a rainbow
And a blackbird on high sang a praise to the sky
While a light aeroplane sprayed the fields with a silvery rain
Furry backed bees with a tireless drone
Never moan, they're happy to be working
And a grasshopper green could be heard but not seen
While a light aeroplane sprayed the fields with a silvery rain
Chorus:
Fly away, Peter, fly away, Paul, before there's nothing left to fly at all
Take to the sky, higher than high, before the silvery rain begins to fall
Nothing moves now but the swaying ripe corn
Not a dawn is greeted with a bird's song
There's a feather or two from a bird that once flew
Before a light aeroplane sprayed the fields with a silvery rain

Have just changed the world we knew, if theyd only turned out right
But now Im a little wise
I can even raise a laugh
At the funny face you pulled on a faded photograph

New days replace yesterdays in time
Its well to bear in mind
That new ways erase
Nothing stays the same
And now youve even changed your name

Para una piel que despedirse de otra piel
Conviene saber que lo único que debes aprender
Es que vinimos a aprender

Conviene saber que tu próxima vida no está asegurada, apaga
La pantalla ahora mismo y saca a tu novia a bailar
Conviene saber que no hay corazones inmunes a la madrugada
Cuando el cuerpo te pide una piel que poder abrazar

Conviene saber que la pasión cuando se amansa aburre un poco
Mejor saberlo antes de embarcar
Conviene saber que todos mis demonios duermen si te toco

Tu risa es una bomba que no sé desactivar 
Hablar de amor contigo es encerrarse en una noria
Querernos es subir a un tren que nunca va a arrancar 
Tenías el cordón yo solo era la peonza 
Así entendí que nadie sale intacto del amor 
Cansado de que no pusieras nombre a nuestra historia 
Me fui a ninguna parte a terminar esta canción 

Y hoy ya no escribo la vida en renglones torcidos 
Prefiero quedarme conmigo 
Prefiero un punto y aparte a que vuelvan a darme puntos suspensivos 
Mejor olvidarse del ruido, cada uno en su propio camino 
Habrá que apuntar en la agenda los sueños pendientes que nunca cumplimos 

Amor es solo un juego donde solamente acierta 
Quien abre el corazón para que dos puedan entrar 
No hay nada más terrible que una puerta entreabierta 
Que nunca abre del todo ni se atreve a cerrar 
Me fui porque quererte era un deporte peligroso 
Se parecía demasiado a la soledad 
No sé si acerté pero sí sé que poco a poco

Me fui a refugiarme entre mi pena y mis canciones 
Me fui porque en tu cama no podíamos soñar

Y que perdonar a quien te daña es la única terapia que te acabará curando 
Cuesta entender nuestro pasado, fuimos el amor correcto en el momento equivocado 
Cuesta, la vida cuesta 

Cuesta confiar en el amor, volver a aquel fotomatón 
Saber que no me estás buscando 
Cuesta 
Comprender que hay ciertos trenes, ciertas pieles 
Ciertas bocas que no acaban regresando 
Cuesta 
No escuchar al corazón 
Cuando el pasado aparece arrepentido por tu barrio 
Cuesta, la vida cuesta

Still, you made your mark, here in my heart

One day I'll fly away
Leave your love to yesterday
What more can your love do for me?
When will love be through with me?

I follow the night
Can't stand the light

My life again?

Marxman,"Once upon a time there was
Irish ways and irish laws
Villages of irish blood
waking to the morning good
But england and her soldiers came
started centuries of shame
Raped our women stole our grain
called this land a different name
Killed the leaders killed the young
put to the sword or gun or hung
history taught this to me
but what some learn is a travesty
I'm saying no slaying is playing it right
and death is the legacy of this fight
but a fight for peace agains injustice
the time has come to discuss this
SAD AFFAIR



I had a dream of days to come
when orange only ment the summer sun
and not the knife that cuts apart
a nations soul a nations heart
a thousand tears my mother shed
sons and daughters have died and bled
i cannot forget their brave example
thank you all for whom i tremple
people have been mistreat for too long
how long to sing this sad song
connolly said we shall rise again
and surely one day the pain must end
some say......thats a bridge too far
some they say......tiocfaidh are la!
some pretend the problems don't exist
some attack and some resist...it's a
SAD AFFAIR



Some say one day our day will come
the race is run we know the outcome
the tide is on the side of the green
the butchers apron no longer seen
but all i know is that peace must win
and i thought this was Ireland mot Britain
a six country state is a bastard state
why oh why can't we all integrate
but my people suffer great injustice daily
condemned by racism in the bailey
the Guildford Four, Maguires and the Six
Innocent! but guilty of being Micks
and my culture is as strong as a pyramid
and you will pay for these things you did
not just to we but to the African
The Asian and the true American
and tomorrow the sorrow will continue
and the hatred will fester in the sinew
i feel like a stranger in the land where i was born
i just have to wait for a new dawn.....it's a

I want to be your sunshine
I want to be your lady
I want to make you happy
I want to drive you crazy
I gotta be right there
Whenever you call on me
I want to be your everything
So tell me if your feeling me

Now all my life
I've never felt like this
For some one else
Yeah baby I'm feeling you
The way that you've been feeling me
When no one else in the world even cared for me
You held me close
The way
You told me things would be okay
On my bad days
And most of my good times were cause of you
Knowing we were strong
Cause the things we've been through
Your the one I want to grow old with
To make my memory's to cherish
In hold in the back of my mind
And girl you was like hard to find
In this crazy world of material things
You loved me when I had nothing
It made you worth some thing

I'm feeling you
Not once
Not twice
But your three times my lady
The comfort of your arms got me feeling like your baby

Your tender touch
And you smile
Always get the best of me
Never let you go or treat you bad

I want to be your light

Have I ever told you girl
That you always on my mind
And when I finally get to see you
I feel a rush inside
A thousand time a day
Your pretty face runs through my mind
I want to stay with you
Cause it was meant to be
Your like an angel from the heavens
That was sent to me
My precious one
The one that fulfills my needs with happiness
The one that keeps me focused
When I,
I start to stress
I want to thank you baby
For the many things you've done for me

When some silly girl had set you free
You wondered how you'd make it through

Mary Black,"There's a wilderness
It's a no man's land
Between alice springs and the ocean
Seventeen hundred miles of burning sand
And a silken thread keeps a hold on you
When the emptieness like a potion tends to fray your reason strand by strand
And there's no more need for the mask your wear
When the last goodbyes have been said
So kiss the cheeks of you dearest friends
And turn to the desert ahead
Now you're on your own like a sailing ship
You're the captain, crew and sailors
Turn around and this is what you see

Chorus

This me facing me all alone
'cause I choose to be with the wind and the sun on me only me

Now you dream so much about being lost
Your ghost by a coolebah sleeping
Haunts you and whispers in your ear
Give up give up this lonely road
No one knows the promise you're keeping
You can't touch the emptiness out here
But the grace that mends this broken wing
The blue sky to regain
Will lift those feet and raise those eyes
To face the desert again
As the dawn reveals the journey's end
In truth it's only beginning
And it's as big as your eyes wish to see

To fly over the mountains

The trains come and go,
But inside you know

Where the sweet life and the flowing wine makes me

Sometimes I've gone completely overboard
Moved a million phrases round, tried to make them leave the ground

Chorus
He is my hero, my dashing darling
He is my caesar, dashing darling.
I've had no rest from forebodings
Since he went far away my darling.

Every day I am constantly sad
Weeping bitterly and shedding tears
Because our lively lad has left us
And no news from him is heard alas.

The cuckoo sings not pleasantly at noon
And the sound of hounds is not heard in nut-filled woods,
Nor summer morning in misty glen
Since he went away from me, my lively boy.

Noble, proud young horseman
Warrior unsaddened, of most pleasant countenace
A swift-moving hand, quick in a fight,
Slaying the enemy and smiting the strong.

Let a strain be played on musical harps
And let many quarts be filled
With high spirit without fault or mist
For life and health to toast my lion.

Dashing darling for a while under sorrow
And all ireland under black cloaks
Rest or pleasure I did not get
Since he went far away my dashing darling.

For a while I was a gentle maiden
And now a spent worn-out widow
My spouse ploughing the waves strongly
Over the hills and far away.

Through anxious fears
No gentle hand
To catch the tears
That soak this ancient ground

Belies a troubled head
Like a voice that holds the secrets
Of the life you might have led
Eyes with pale indifference
In danger and in grace
But the glance that knows the death-knell
Left it's shadow on your face
In the deep enduring darkness
As your loyal friends go down
Touched by the violent crown
'til their hunter's hunted down

The endless dreamers shed,

As the parting turned inside
A thousand times you cried
But the shadow never died.

And he fades in the shadows

Boasts no chest proud anthem

Oh come on, walk with me, talk with me
Tell me your stories
I'll do my best to understand you

Oh won't you walk with me, talk with me
Tell me your stories
I'll do my very best to understand you
You're flesh and blood, flesh and blood
You're flesh and blood",Flesh and Blood,1993
Mary Black,"I looked into a mirror made of lines
With tiny symbols here and there to make the image mine
A woman stood and painted and showed me what to find
The different parts, the fire, the air, and where my life would climb
And where it joins another, and what would always bind

It's a golden thread to hold you all of my days
Hold my head against you now and for always
Sewn me up, shown us a long, long time
Makes you my life, makes you my life

The moving finger writes and goes away
I'm weighed upon a balance here and I'm told that I can stay
The kettle heats, the water speaks up, says I'm not alone
My whole life is a tapestry and hanging in my home
And here it joins another by what will always bind

It's a golden thread to hold you all of my days
Hold my head against you now and for always
Sewn me up, shown us a long, long time
Makes you my life, makes you my life

And when you looked, your angel flew away
And what it meant was your protection's gone another day
And what has come to change you, and have you come what may
Is fashioned by an old triangle, green as April haze
Blue is just a color, but blue is here to stay

It's a golden thread to hold you all of my days
Hold my head against you now and for always
Sewn me up, shown us a long, long time
Makes you my life

It's a golden thread to hold you all of my days
Hold my head against you now and for always
Sewn me up, shown us a long, long time

Mary Black,"Farewell my lovely Johnny, a thousand times adieu
You are going away from the holy ground and the ones that love you true
You will sail the salt seas over and then return for sure
To see again the ones you love and the holy ground once more

You're on the salt sea sailing, and I am safe behind
Fond letters I will write to you, the secrets of my mind
And the secrets of my mind, my love, you're the one that I adore
Still I live in hopes you'll see the holy ground once more

I see the storm a-rising, and it's coming quick and soon
And the night's so dark and cloudy you can scarcely see the moon
And the secrets of my mind, my love, you're the one that I adore
And still I live in hopes you'll see the holy ground once more

But now the storms are over, and you are safe and well
We will go into a public house and we'll sit and drink our fill
We will drink strong ale and porter and we'll make the rafters roar
And when our money, it is all spent, you'll go to sea once more

You're the one that I adore
And still I live in hopes that you'll see the holy ground once more",The Holy Ground,1993
Mary Black,"It reads like a fairytale, and that's what it was
Young man in his prime, young girl from the cross
The most perfect of strangers, and then the night closed in
And the holy ground took care of everything

Now she was a fine one, and he was a handsome man
One look was enough, and away they ran
They spent many happy hours and then the night closed in
And the holy ground took care of everything

Oh what's the use in complaining?
In for a penny, in for a pound
I remember the loving time
And nothing else really counts

And I recall the promise they made
With a faith I can but admire
That she'd be the one he adored
And he'd be her heart's desire

It didn't come true in the end, they went their separate ways
He couldn't change what he was, she wasn't ready to wait
They couldn't live in the daylight, they let the night close in
And the holy ground took care of everything

They couldn't live in the daylight, they let the night close in
And the holy ground took care of everything
They couldn't live in the daylight, they let the night close in
And the holy ground took care of everything

I remember the loving time
And nothing else really counts",The Loving Time,1993
Mary Black,"There you may stand in your splendor and jewels
Swaying me in both directions
One is the right one, the other for fools
How do I make my selection?
The city lies silent in the warm morning light
The sand is as golden as saffron
Oasis of love, sweet water of life
God bless the poor ones who have none though they have tried

Someone is drowning down there in the flood
But this river will dry by tomorrow
Is it ocean or stream, this love in my blood?
Bringer of joy or of sorrow?
The end of the journey must soon be in sight
Birth is the start of the swansong
Oasis of love, sweet water of life
God bless the poor ones who want some, but are denied

No one is given the map to their dreams
All we can do is to trace it
See where we go to, know where we've been
Build up the courage to face it
While we fumble in the darkness where once there was light
Roaming the land of the ancients
Oasis of love, sweet water of life
God bless the poor ones whose patience never died

While we stumble in blindness where once there was sight
Searching for trees in the forest
Oasis of love, sweet water of life
God bless the poor ones who have none though they have tried

God bless the poor ones who want some, but are denied
God bless the poor ones whose patience never died
God bless the poor ones on that one-way donkey ride",One Way Donkey Ride,1993
Mary Black,"If I gave my heart to you
Would you promise to be true
It would break my heart in two
If you left me waiting anticipating

Till some other magic day
I may steal your heart away
Then you would take my hand
And then understand me
When you'd really see me

In a world of different dreams
Where all things aren't what they seem
When you would take my hand

If I gave my heart
If I gave my heart
If I gave my heart to you

For only truth remains
Cause all things are just the same
The excepting part of truth

",If I Gave My Heart to You,1995
Mary Black,"Last night I dreamed you were back again
Larger than life again, holding me tight again
Placing those same kisses on my brow
Sweeter than ever now, lord I remember how
Couldn't get enough of kissing
Do you know how much I'm missing?
No you don't, but I do

Days like a slow train trickle by
Even the words that I write refuse to fly
All that I can hear is your song haunting me
Can't get the melody out of my head you see
Distractions I've been using
Do you know how much I'm losing?
No you don't, but I do

But I do and I wonder if I'm past the point of rescue
An is no word from you at all the best that you can do
Never meant to push or shove you
Do you know how much I love you?
No you don't, but I do.
",Past the Point of Rescue,1995
Mary Black,"Phone calls and taxi-rides
And somebody's leaving
Misunderstandings get out of control
And the right words get left
And the wrong words get spoken
He's gone but not your pride

Chorus

Not much can help
The full heart that's breaking
Can't find the words
And you can't hide the feelings
And it's down to the bone
To the heart of the matter
You're free free as stone

Look at you now
You're the picture of sorrow
Head in your hands
Like a scene from a movie
And all of the things
That seemed so important
Are leaves and are blowing away

Chorus

Nothing can help
The full heart that's breaking
You can't find the words
And you can't hide the feelings
And it's down to the bone
To the heart of the matter
You're free free as stone

Walk through this town
On a cold Sunday morning
Soldiers in uniforms
Guns in their hands
The world all caught up
With barbed wire fences
I'm free I'm free as stone

Chorus

Oh nothing can help
The full heart that's breaking
Won't find the words
And you can't hide the feelings
And it's down to bone
To the heart of the matter

Mary Black,"When I was young I spoke like a child, and I saw with a child's eyes
And an open door was to a girl like the stars are to the sky
It's funny how the world lives up to all your expectations
With adventures for the stout of heart, and the lure of the open spaces

There's 2 lanes running down this road, whichever side you're on
Accounts for where you want to go, or what you're running from
Back when darkness overtook me on a blind man's curve

I relied upon the moon, I relied upon the moon
I relied upon the moon and Saint Christopher
Now I've paid my dues cuz I have owed them, but I've paid a price sometimes
For being such a stubborn woman in such stubborn times

Now I've paid my dues cuz I have owed them, but I've paid a price sometimes
For being such a stubborn woman in such stubborn times
Now I have run from the arms of lovers, I've run from the eyes of friends
I have run from the hands of kindness, I've run just because I can

But now I'm grown and I speak like a woman and I see with a woman's eyes
And an open door is to me now like the saddest of goodbyes
It's too late for turning back, I pray for the heart and the nerve

And I rely upon the moon, I rely upon the moon
I rely upon the moon and Saint Christopher

With the book of life before him
Strange instruments upon his charts
And the crystal glow inside him
He's your Wonder Child
And my dreams come true
You've searched all your life
I see him now flying over the universe
This child will build a violin
One will follow the traveler's love
Another will the bow apply
To reach the one above

With the moon and stars above her
Her simple smile is Heaven's gate

Mary Black,"Adam's at the window staring at the apple trees on fire
Waiting for the windfall that brings the smile of kings and their desire
Door blows in behind him, a floral pattern, summer dress so gay
Burning in the sunlight, too late to wait, for darkness won't delay
To steal her cherry lips away
For while the careless tongues of sunlight slowly trickle down
The curve of hips, her fingertips, in kissing sips we drown
In kissing sips we drown

And Adam will have his way
Adam will have his way

Adam's on the island, living in the land of love
Shadows lurk around him, drunk on the royal jelly of pure love
Full and ripe, the fruit hang, for when the prince arrives he will want more
And more and more he will drink from the canvas cup
The son of a swan will then loose his plumera
And he will wear a new age suit and haunt the joints in town
And play a silver magic flute and call his lovers down
And call his lovers down

And Adam will have his way
Adam will have his way
Will have his way

Adam's at the easel painting in the wrinkles and the gray
Waiting for November, easy with the darkness of the day
Smiles a tear of gladness, and Adam's at the window once again

To steal her cherry lips away

Mary Black,"I skimmed across black water
Without once submerging
Onto the banks of an urban morning
That hungers the first light
Much, much more than mountains ever do

And she, like a ghost beside me
Goes down with the ease of a dolphin
And emerges unlearned, unshamed, unharmed
For she is the perfect creature, natural in every feature
And I am the geek with the alchemists' stone

For all of you who must discover
For all who seek to understand
For having left the path of others
You'll find a very special hand

Mary Black,"If life is a river and your heart is a boat
And just like a water baby, baby born to float
And if life is a wild wind that blows way on high
And your heart is Amelia dying to fly

Heaven knows no frontiers
And I've seen heaven in your eyes
And if life is a bar room in which we must wait
'Round the man with his fingers on the ivory gates

Where we sing until dawn of our fears and our fates
And we stack all the deadmen in self addressed crates
In your eyes faint as the singing of a lark
That somehow this black night

Feels warmer for the spark
Warmer for the spark
To hold us 'til the day
When fear will lose its grip

And heaven has its way
Heaven knows no frontiers
And I've seen heaven in your eyes
If your life is a rough bed of brambles and nails

And your spirit's a slave to man's whips and man's jails
Where you thirst and you hunger for justice and right
Then your heart is a pure flame of man's constant night
In your eyes faint as the singing of a lark

That somehow this black night
Feels warmer for the spark
Warmer for the spark
To hold us 'til the day when fear will lose its grip

And heaven has its way
And heaven has its way
When all will harmonise
And know it's in our hearts

Down that long road you have traveled,
And I see
All the pain that you have suffered.

Desert flower in her hand,
Barefoot on the red heartland;
Innocence makes few demands.

Heart and soul,
My soul sister;
Got that special part of me.
Such sweet love and deep devotion.
Who would tame what's wild and free?

Here we are
In this crazy, crazy world.
Circumstance
Can lead you on to desperation.
Love can save the weary heart,
Or it can tear us all apart.
I would rather take that chance
Than to never trust again.

[Chorus]

Looking forward,
Down that long road we might travel,
And I see
All the joy that is recovered.
See the young boy by the river side;
He throws a stick to the other side.
It carries with the rising tide.
Sometimes we might reach too high.

From the city that dreams
Ring them bells from the sanctuaries
Cross the valleys and streams

And the world's on it's side
And time is running backwards
And so is the bride

Ring the bells st.peter
Where the four winds blow
Ring them bells with an iron hand

Oh it's rush hour now
On the wheel and the plow
And the sun is going down
Upon the sacred cow

Ring them bells sweet martha
For the poor man's son
Ring them bells so the world will know
That God is one
Oh the shephered is asleep
Where the willows weep
And the mountains they are filled
With lost sheep

Ring them bells for the blind and the deaf
Ring them bells for all of us who are left
Ring them bells for the chosen few
Who will judge the many when the day is through
Ring them bells, for the time that flies
For the child that cries
When the innocence dies

Ring them bells st.catherine

Ring the bells from the fortress
For the lillies that bloom
For the lines they are long
And the fighting is strong
And they're breaking down the distance
Between right and wrong

Where we slept; now it's growing cold.

By the hearth, all apart, it hangs on my heart

No I'm not scared; I wait for you
Hey Jesse, it's lonely, come home.

Your step; and I remember too.

And I still set a place on the table at noon

And I'm leaving the light on the stairs
No I'm not scared; I wait for you
Hey Jesse, it's lonely, come home.

Jesse the spread on the bed,
It's like when you left, I kept it for you.

Cheap hotel furniture where silence never stops

At cars all frozen now and street light waterfalls

Mary Black,"I can see it in your eyes
What I know in my heart is true
That our love it has faded like the summer run through
So we walk doen the shore line one last time together
Feel the wind blow our wandering hearts like a feather
But who knows who's waiting in the wings of time
Dry your eyes
We're gonna go where we can shine

Don't be hiding in sorrow or clinging to the past
With your beauty so precious and the seasons so fast
No matter how cold the horizon appears or how far the first night when I held you near
You've gotta rise from these ashes like a bird of flame
Take my hand
We're gonna go where we can shine

For all that we struggle for all we pretend
It don't come down to nothing except love in the end
And ours is a road that is strewn with goodbyes
But as it unfolds as it all unwinds
Remember your soul is the one thing you just can't compromise
Step out of the shadows

You gotta go where we can shine
Oh we're gonna go where we can shine
Shine",Shine,1997
Mary Black,"When I see you coming
In your trespass shoes
Hear the song you're humming
How can i refuse
With your half drunk bottle
And your slurring tongue
Singing sentimental
Don't it always make me feel so young

Been alone
We've been together
Stood at toe to toe
Getting older doesn't matter when lights down low
When the push comes down to shoving
When the four winds blow
Ain't nobody ever loved me like you do

Now my heels are snagging
On these pavement stones
Days and nights are dragging
'Til I get you home
With your four o'clock shadow
and your cowboy songs
Singing sentimental
Don't it always make me feel so strong

Been alone
We've been together
Stood at toe to toe
Getting older doesn't matter when lights down low
Push comes to shove and worse for better
when the four winds blow
Ain't nobody ever loved me like you do

With your forehead furrowed
And your facts all wrong
Oh so temperamental
Oh but baby when it's said and done

Been alone
We've been together
Stood at toe to toe
Getting older doesn't matter when lights down low
Push comes to shove and worse for better
Only goes to show when the four winds blow

Mary Black,"What does it matter if the sun don't rise
It's midnight forever in my Jimmy's eyes
What should it matter if it comes on to spring
When I'm finding winter in everything

Lived in this cold wind city all of my life
Walking around still looks the same
Same people coming and going
It doesn't feel right - See it all now - From so far away

All of the wisdom that I held so high
Shining and useless as this April sky
The hedgerows are singing and it comes on spring
But I'm finding winter in everything

Lived in this cold wind city all of my life
Walking around still looks the same
Same people coming and going
It doesn't feel right - See it all now - From so far away

So what should it matter if the earth may slide
Sky break in pieces or the stars collide
The little of sense left in this world or ours
My Jimmy took with him in the wee small hours

Lived in this cold wind city all of my life
Walking around still looks the same
Same people coming and going
It doesn't feel right - See it all now - It's so far away

I'm finding winter in everything

Mary Black,"Better keep your distance from this whale
Better keep your boat from going astray
Find yourself a partner and treat them well
Try to give them shelter night and day
'cause here in this blue light
Far away from the fireside
Things can get twisted and crazy and crowded
You can't even feel right

So you dream of columbus
Ever time the panic starts
You dream of columbus
With your maps and your beautiful charts
You dream of columbus
With an ache in your travelling heart

See how the cormorant swoops and dives
Must be some thrill to go that deep
Down to the basement of this life
Down to where the mermaid gently sleeps
Not like here in this blue light
Far away from the fireside
Where things can get twisted and haunted and crowded
You can't even feel alright

Chorus

And as tide must ebb and flow
I am dragged down under
And I wait the livelong day
For an end to my hunger

So I dream of columbus
Every time that the panic starts
I dream of columbus
With my maps and my beautiful charts
I dream of columbus
And there's peace in a traveling heart
I dream of columbus
",Columbus,1998
Mary Black,"Oh play me a blue song 
And fade down the light
I'm sad as a proud man can be sad tonight
Just let me dream on, 
Oh just let me sway
While the sweet violins 
And the saxophones play

But can't we pretend
That we care for each other, 
Till the band reach the end

One step for sighing and two steps for crying
Waltzing's for dreamers and losers in love

Now they say love's for gamblers, 
Oh the pendulum swings
I bet hard on love and I lost everything
So don't send me home now, 
Put a shot in my arm
And we'll drink out old memories 
And we'll drink in the dawn
And Mr Bandleader won't you play one more time
For I've good folding money in this pocket of mine

Mary Black,"Walking all the day near tall towers where falcons build their nests
Silver winged they fly, they know the call of freedom in their breasts
Soar Black Head against the sky
Between the rocks that run down to the sea
Living on your western shore, saw summer sunsets, asked for more
I stood by your Atlantic sea and sang a song for Ireland

Talking all the day with true friends, who try to make you stay
Telling jokes and news, singing songs to pass the night away
Watched the Galway salmon run like silver dancing darting in the sun
Living on your western shore saw summer sunsets, asked for more
I stood by your Atlantic sea and sang a song for Ireland

Drinking all the day in old pubs where fiddlers love to play
Someone touched the bow, he played a reel, it seemed so fine and gay
Stood on Dingle beach and cast, in wild foam we found Atlantic Bass
Living on your western shore, saw summer sunsets asked for more
I stood by your Atlantic sea and sang a song for Ireland

Dreaming in the night, I saw a land where no man had to fight
Waking in your dawn, I saw you crying in the morning light
Lying where the Falcons fly, they twist and turn all in you e'er blue sky
Living on your western shore, saw summer sunsets asked for more
I stood by your Atlantic sea and I sang a song for Ireland

Mary Black,"I'm giving up on tv it's not making sense
Gotta trust ourselves it's the last line of defence
Spinning into space running out of time
Gathering together all the useful things we find

Chorus

So don't say okay and be half-hearted
I'm afraid that this feeling goes on

Sacrifice the world face a killing sun
You gotta get it all together it'll bring us all undone
We're running up hills that we already climbed
Over the top and falling down the other side

Chorus

The ghosts are at the window they're again tonight
Looking in on us so we have got to get it right
We've walking on their bones everywhere we go
Spirits in the wind and the memories in the stones

How we gonna get the healing done?

Mary Black,"I'm really close tonight
I feel like I'm moving inside him
Lying in the dark
I think that I'm beginning to know him
Let it go

And whenever I fall at your feet
Won't you let your tears rain down one me
Whenever I touch your slow turning pain

Don't hide it from me now
There's something in the way that you're talking
Words don't sound right
I hear them all moving inside you
You know - I'll be waiting when you call

Mary Black,"You'll remember me when the west wind moves upon the fields of barley
You'll forget the sun in his jealous sky as we walk in fields of gold
So she took her love for to gaze awhile upon the fields of barley
In his arms she fell as her hair came down among the fields of gold
 
Will you stay with me, will you be my love among the fields of barley?
We'll forget the sun in his jealous sky as we lie in fields of gold
See the west wind move like a lover so upon the fields of barley.
Feel her body rise when you kiss her mouth among the fields of gold
 
I never made promises lightly and there have been some that I've broken
But I swear in the days still left we'll walk in fields of gold
We'll walk in fields of gold
 
Many years have passed since those summer days among the fields of barley
See the children run as the sun goes down among the fields of gold
You'll remember me when the west wind moves upon the fields of barley
You can tell the sun in his jealous sky when we walked in fields of gold
When we walked in fields of gold, when we walked in fields of gold",Fields of Gold [*],2000

Or undermine you
He don't know how to steal
How to deal or deceive

You say he's so helpless
Well what about you
You don't pull the strings
Don't you know anything
Just leave him alone, let him be
Cause he's speaking with the angel
That only he can see

Would you teach him about heaven
Would you show him how to love the earth
Would you poison him with prejudice
From the moment of his birth

He in the blood of the lamb
He that never lays blame
He don't even know his name

Mary Black,"When I was young I spoke like a child, and I saw with a child's eyes
And an open door was to a girl like the stars are to the sky
It's funny how the world lives up to all your expectations
With adventures for the stout of heart, and the lure of the open spaces

There's 2 lanes running down this road, whichever side you're on
Accounts for where you want to go, or what you're running from
Back when darkness overtook me on a blind man's curve

I relied upon the moon, I relied upon the moon
I relied upon the moon and Saint Christopher
Now I've paid my dues cuz I have owed them, but I've paid a price sometimes
For being such a stubborn woman in such stubborn times

Now I've paid my dues cuz I have owed them, but I've paid a price sometimes
For being such a stubborn woman in such stubborn times
Now I have run from the arms of lovers, I've run from the eyes of friends
I have run from the hands of kindness, I've run just because I can

But now I'm grown and I speak like a woman and I see with a woman's eyes
And an open door is to me now like the saddest of goodbyes
It's too late for turning back, I pray for the heart and the nerve

And I rely upon the moon, I rely upon the moon
I rely upon the moon and Saint Christopher

All the hurt that seems so real

Oh come on walk with me, talk with me,
Tell me your stories

Like a shot in the dark went your hallowed ground
Had you taken too much
Keep him well out of touch 
And refused to let him go
I cannot see to your pain
I do not hear you complain
You are now but a dot in the pouring rain
You created this mess
Now he's bent to your stress
And it seems to suit you well

One and only
Two can be lonely
One last child
Blessed and unholy
In his eyes the storm's surely rising up
Doo doo doo doo doo doo

I do not see the way out
You cannot turn this around
Like a walk in the dark
You have weighed him down
I can't stand in your place
Can't take this away
It was all too good to be true

You never talk about it
You never scream about it
You took a spirit young and whole
And turned the child to an old soul

You never talk about it
You never screamed about it
You covet things that you don't own
You turned the child to an old soul",One & Only,2003
