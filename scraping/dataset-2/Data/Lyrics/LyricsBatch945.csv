Rodolfo,"Hoy te he visto, con tus libros caminando 
Y tu carita de coqueta, colegiala de mi amor 
Tu sonríes sin pensar que al mirarte 
Solo por ti estoy sufriendo, colegiala de mi amor

Rodolfo Mederos,"Acaricia mi sueño
El suave murmullo de tu suspirar
Como ríe la vida
Si tus ojos negros me quieren mirar
Y si es mío el amparo
De tu risa leve
Que es como un cantar
Ella quieta mi herida
Todo, todo se olvida

El día que me quieras
La rosa que engalana
Se vestirá de fiesta
Con su mejor color
Y al viento las campanas
Dirán que ya eres mía
Y locas las fontanas
Se contaran su amor

La noche que me quieras
Desde el azul del cielo
Las estrellas celosas
Nos miraran pasar
Y un rayo misterioso
Hará nido en tu pelo
Luciérnaga curiosa
Que vera que eres mi consuelo

El día que me quieras
No habrá mas que armonía
Será clara la aurora
Y alegre el manantial
Traerá quieta la brisa
Rumor de melodías
Y nos darán las fuentes
Su canto de cristal

El día que me quieras
Endulzara sus cuerdas
El pájaro cantor
Florecerá la vida
No existirá el dolor

La noche que me quieras",El Día Que Me Quieras,1995
Rodolfo Mederos,"Me acobardo la soledad
Y el miedo enorme de morir lejos de ti
Que ganas tuve de llorar
Sintiendo junto a mí
La burla de la realidad

Y el corazón me suplico que te buscara
Y que le diera su querer
Me lo pedía el corazón
Y entonces te busque
Creyéndote mi salvación

Y ahora que estoy frente a ti
Parecemos, ya ves dos extraños
Lección que por fin aprendí
Como cambian las cosas los años

Al escucharte fríamente conversar
Fue tan distinto nuestro amor
Y duele comprobar que todo
Todo termino

Qué gran error volverte a ver
Para llevarme destrozado el corazón
Son mil fantasmas al volver
Burlándose de mí
Las horas de ese muerto ayer

Y ahora que estoy frente a ti
Parecemos, ya ves dos extraños
Lección que por fin aprendí
Como cambian las cosas los años

Angustia de saber muerta ya
La ilusión y la fe
Perdón si me ves lagrimear
Los recuerdos me han hecho mal

",Como Dos Extraños,1995
Rodolfo Mederos,"Si arrastré por estemundo
la vergüenza de habersido
y el dolor de ya no ser...
Bajo el ala del sombrero,
cuántas veces embozada
una lágrima asomada
yo no pude contener...
Si crucé por los caminos
como un paria que el Destino
se empeño en deshacer...
Si fui flojo, si fui ciego,
sólo quiero que comprendan
el valor que representa
el coraje de querer.

Era para mí la vida entera,
como un sol de primavera,
mi esperanza y mí pasión.
Sabía
que en el mundo no cabía
toda la humilde alegría
de mi pobre corazón.
Ahora, 
cuesta abajo en mi rodada,
las ilusiones pasadas
yo no las puedo arrancar.
Sueño
con el pasado que añoro,
el tiempo viejo que lloro
y que nunca volverá.

Por seguir tras de su huella
yo bebí incansablemente
en mi copa de dolor,
pero nade comprendía
que si todo yo lo daba
en cada vuelta dejaba
pedazos de corazón.
Ahora, triste en la pendiente,
solitario y ya vencido,
yo me quiero confesar.

¡Si aquella boca mentía
el amor que me ofrecía,
por aquellos ojos brujos
yo habría dado siempre más!

por qué él no habrí­a de hacerlo 
La fama le presentó una blanca mujer 
de misterioso sabor y prohibido placer, 
que lo hizo adicto al deseo de usarla otra vez

When space unfolds
The void ahead
Is inside of you

You were made to go out and get her
The minute you let her under your skin
Then you begin to make it better

And anytime you feel the pain, hey Jude, refrain
Don't carry the world upon your shoulders
For well you know that it's a fool who plays it cool
By making his world a little colder

Hey Jude, don't let me down
You have found her, now go and get her
Remember to let her into your heart

That made you pay the cost
That now assumes relaxed positions
And prostitutes your loss?
Were you tortured by your own thirst
In those pleasures that you seek
That made you Tom the curious
That makes you James the weak?

And you claim you got something going
Something you call unique
But I've seen your self-pity showing
As the tears rolled down your cheeks

Soon you know I'll leave you
And I'll never look behind
'Cos I was born for the purpose
That crucifies your mind
So con, convince your mirror
As you've always done before
Giving substance to shadows

Splashed on my clothes as I spilled out of bed
Opened the window to listen to the news

Divorce the only answer smoking causes cancer
This system's gonna fall soon, to an angry young tune
And that's a concrete cold fact

The pope digs population, freedom from taxation
Teeny Bops are up tight, drinking at a stoplight
Miniskirt is flirting I can't stop so I'm hurting
Spinster sells her hopeless chest

Madness passed me by, she smiled hi
I nodded

A cold fact
Asked about her bag, suburbia's such a drag
Won't go back
'Cause Papa don't allow no new ideas here
And now he sees the news, but the picture's not too clear

Crooked children, yellow chalk
Writing on the concrete walk
Their King died
Drinking from a Judas cup
Looking down but seeing up
Sweet red wine

But the words don't sound too clear

In Rock and Roll, USA
In the shadow of the tallest building
I vowed I would break away
Listened to the Sunday actors
But all they would ever say

That you can't get away from it
No you can't get away
No you can't get away from it
No you can't get away

Schooled on the city sidewalks
Coldness at every turn
Knew I had to find the exits
I never, ever would return
Scoffed at the prophet's omens
That said I would live to learn

That you can't get away from it
No you can't get away
No you can't get away from it
No you can't get away

Stopped in the sleepy town
Left my change and walked out
I didn't even turn around

Was that old familiar sound

That you can't get away from 
No you can't get away
No you can't get away from
No you can't get away

On a wild and windy August night
As a cloud passed over a cold moon

Seeping up through the floorboards
Coming in through the walls
Coming in through the doorway
Ringing up and down the halls

Brings memories back when you were here
Of your smile, your easy laughter
Of your kiss, those moments after

And think of you
And think of you.

Of the dreams, we dreamt together
Of the love we vowed would never
Melt like snowflakes in the sun
My days now end as they begun
With thoughts of you,
And I think of you
And think of you.

Down the streets I walked with you
Seeing others doing things we do
Now these thoughts are haunting me
Of how complete I used to be

I've played faggot bars, hooker bars, motorcycle funerals
In opera houses, concert halls, halfway houses.

Well I found that in all these places that I've played
All the people that I've played for are the same people
So if you'll listen, maybe you'll see someone you know in this song.

A most disgusting song.

The local diddy bop pimp comes in
Acting limp he sits down with a grin
Next to a girl that has never been chaste
The bartender wipes a smile off his face
The delegates cross the floor,
Curtsy and promenade through the doors,
And slowly the evening begins.

And there's Jimmy ""Bad Luck"" Butts
Who's just crazy about them East Lafayette weekend sluts
Talking is the lawyer in crumpled up shirt
And everyone's drinking the detergents
That cannot remove their hurts

While the Mafia provides your drugs,
Your government will provide the shrugs,
And your national guard will supply the slugs,
So they sit all satisfied.

And there's old playboy Ralph
Who's always been shorter than himself,
And there's a man with his chin in his hand,
Who knows more than he'll ever understand.

Yeah, every night it's the same old thing
Getting high, getting drunk, getting horny
At the Inn-Between, again.

And there's the bearded schoolboy with the wooden eyes
Who at every scented skirt whispers up and sighs
And there's a teacher that will kiss you in French
Who could never give love, could only fearfully clench

Yeah, people every night it's the same old thing
Getting pacified, ossified, affectionate at Mr. Flood's party, again

And there's the militant with his store-bought soul
There's someone here who's almost a virgin I've been told
And there's Linda glass-made who speaks of the past
Who genuflects, salutes, signs the cross and stands at half mast

Yeah, they're all here, the Tiny Tims and the Uncle Toms,
Redheads, brunettes, brownettes and the dyed haired blondes,
Who talk to dogs, chase broads and have hopes of being mobbed,
Who mislay their dreams and later claim that they were robbed

And every night it's going to be the same old thing
Getting high, getting drunk, getting horny
Lost, even, at Martha's Vineyard, again",A Most Disgusting Song,1971
Rodriguez,"The generals hate holidays
Others shoot up to chase the sun blues away

She asks me up to her place
But I won't be down anymore

Judges with meter maid hearts
Order super market justice starts
Frozen children inner city
Walkers in the paper rain
Waiting for those knights that never came
The hi-jacked trying so hard to be pretty

Night rains tap at my window
Winds of my thoughts passing by
She laughed when I tried to tell her
Hello only ends in goodbye

America gains another pound
Only time will bring some people around
Idols and flags are slowly melting

To pair it for some will suffice

Sea-purple harmony
While kogi hit secrets into seashells
And even the ocean laughed
Beneath that celestial canopy

Cuz it started out so nice

With the dust of stars they intermingled
Durock of avon would only jingle
Marble money tunes
As pale earthly circles swooned

Volume left bohemia, a triangle for his thumb
Questions fell but no one stopped to listen
That eternity was just a dawn away
And the rest was sure to come
Leaves, caught in winter's ice

Abandoned circus grounds of flower captains
Prisms in a palm one way it happens
The air was silver calm
The softly met were slowly moving on

Then all things in common suddenly grew strange
Now the wurs were chasing other rainbows
Trying to find where the wind blows
To empty corners past dusty memories

Now in the third millennium the crowded madness came
Crooked shadows roamed through the nights
The wizards overplayed their names
And after that the wurs never bothered to have

Come and travel with me to search the magic sounds.",Ecuador,1997
Rodriguez,"Born in the troubled city
In Rock and Roll, USA
In the shadow of the tallest building
I vowed I would break away
Listened to the Sunday actors
But all they would ever say

That you can't get away from it
No you can't get away
No you can't get away from it
No you can't get away

Schooled on the city sidewalks
Coldness at every turn
Knew I had to find the exits
I never, ever would return
Scoffed at the prophet's omens
That said I would live to learn

That you can't get away from it
No you can't get away
No you can't get away from it
No you can't get away

Going unaided toward the west coast
Stopped in the sleepy town
Left my change and walked out
I didn't even turn around
What they were getting next to
Was that old familiar sound

That you can't get away from it
No you can't get away
No you can't get away from it
No you can't get away

In a hotel room in Amsterdam
On a wild and windy August night
As a cloud passed over a cold moon
My heart was seized with terror and fright
Seeping up through the floorboards
Coming in through the walls
Coming in through the doorway
Ringing up and down the halls

That you can't get away from it
No you can't get away
No you can't get away from it
No you can't get away

No you can't get away
No you can't get away
No you can't get away",Can't Get Away,1998
Rodriguez,"Have you ever had a fever,
From a bitter-sweet refrain,
Have you ever kissed the sunshine,
Walked between the rain.

Well, just climb up on my music,
And my songs will set you free,
Well, just climb up on my music,
And from there jump off with me.

Well, there was a girl named Christmas,
Did I tell ya she drank gold,
She wasn't very hard to capture,
But she was rather hard to hold.

Well, just climb up on my music,
And my songs will set you free,
Well, just climb up on my music,
And from there jump off with me.

Have you ever been in darkness,
And your mind could find no peace,
When you woke up after midnight,
Found your swans have turned to geese.

Rodriguez,"'Cause I lost my job two weeks before Christmas
And I talked to Jesus at the sewer
And the Pope said it was none of his God-damned business
While the rain drank champagne

My Estonian Archangel came and got me wasted
'Cause the sweetest kiss I ever got is the one I've never tasted
Oh but they'll take their bonus pay to Molly McDonald,
Neon ladies, beauty is that which obeys, is bought or borrowed

'Cause my heart's become a crooked hotel full of rumors
But it's I who pays the rent for these fingered-face out-of-tuners
And I make sixteen solid half hour friendships every evening

'Cause your queen of hearts who is half a stone
And likes to laugh alone is always threatening you with leaving
Oh but they play those token games on Willy Thompson
And give a medal to replace the son of Mrs. Annie Johnson

'Cause they told me everybody's got to pay their dues
And I explained that I had overpaid them
So overdued I went to the company store
And the clerk there said that they had just been invaded
So I set sail in a teardrop and escaped beneath the doorsill

'Cause the smell of her perfume echoes in my head still
'Cause I see my people trying to drown the sun
In weekends of whiskey sours
'Cause how many times can you wake up in this comic book and plant flowers?",Cause,2005
Rodriguez,"And I'll forget about the girl that said no
Then I'll tell who I want where to go
And I'll forget about your lies and deceit
And your attempts to be so discreet

And you can keep your symbols of success
Then I'll pursue my own happiness
And you can keep your clocks and routines
Then I'll go mend all my shattered dreams

Maybe today, yeah
I'll slip away

'Cause you've been down on me for too long
And for too long I just put you on
Now I'm tired of lying and I'm sick of trying
Cause I'm losing who I really am
And I'm not choosing to be like them

Rodriguez,"The generals hate holidays
Others shoot up to chase the sun blues away
Another store front church is open
Sea of neon lights, a boxer his shadow fights
Soldier tired and sailor broken
Winter's asleep at my window
Cold wind waits at my door
She asks me up to her place
But I won't be down anymore

Judges with metermaid hearts
Order super market justice starts
Frozen children inner city
Walkers in the paper rain
Waiting for those knights that never came
The hi-jacked trying so hard to be pretty

Night rains tap at my window
Winds of my thoughts passing by
She laughed when I tried to tell her
Hello only ends in goodbye

America gains another pound
Only time will bring some people around
Idols and flags are slowly melting
Another shower of rice
To pair it for some will suffice
The mouthful asks for second helpings

The night puts it's laughter away
Clouds that pierce the illusion
That tomorrow would be as yesterday",Sandrevan Lullaby,2005
Rodriguez,"Now you sit there thinking feeling insecure 
The mocking court gesture claims there is no proven cure 
Go back to your chamber, your eyes upon the wall
'Cause you got no one to listen, you got no one to call

And you think I'm curious

Drifting, drowning in a purple sea of doubt 
You wanna hear she loves you
But the words don't fit the mouth 
You're a loser, a rebel, a cause without

But don't think me callous

Dancing Rosemary, disappearing sister Ruth 
It's just your yellow appetite
That has you choking on the truth 
You gave in, you gave out, outlived your dreams of youth 

And I can't get jealous

So go on, you'll continue with your nose so open wide 
Knocking on that door that says hurry come inside
But don't bother to buy insurance 'cos you've already died 

And you can't be serious 

I saw my reflection in my father's final tears 
The wind was slowly melting, San Francisco disappears 
Acid heads, unmade beds, and you Woodward world queers

I know you're lonely
I know you're lonely
I know you're lonely

And you can thank me for mine 
And after that's said
Forget it

Rodriguez,"And you measure for wealth by the things you can hold 
And you measure for love by the sweet things you're told
And you live in the past or a dream that you're in
And your selfishness is your cardinal sin

And you want to be held with highest regard 
It delights you so much if he's trying so hard
And you try to conceal your ordinary ways
With a smile or a shrug or some stolen cliche

But don't you understand, and don't you look about 
I'm trying to take nothing from you 
So why should you act so put out for me?

'Cause emotionally you're the same basic trip
And you know that I know of the times that you've slipped 
So don't try to impress me, you're just pins and paint 
And don't try to charm me with things that you ain't

And don't try to enchant me with your manner of dress 
'Cause a monkey in silk is a monkey no less 
So measure for measure reflect on my said 
And when I won't see you then measure it dead

'Cause don't you understand, and don't you look about 
I'm trying to take nothing from you 
So why should you act so put out
And sit there and wonder and doubt

Council woman hesitates
Public gets irate but forget the vote date

Garbage ain't collected, women ain't protected
Politicians using, people they're abusing
The mafia's getting bigger, like pollution in the river
And you tell me that this is where it's at

Woke up this morning with an ache in my head
I splashed on my clothes as I spilled out of bed
I opened the window to listen to the news
But all I heard was the Establishment's Blues

Gun sales are soaring, housewives find life boring
Divorce the only answer smoking causes cancer
This system's gonna fall soon, to an angry young tune
And that's a concrete cold fact

The pope digs population, freedom from taxation
Teeny Bops are uptight, drinking at a stoplight
Miniskirt is flirting I can't stop so I'm hurting
Spinster sells her hopeless chest

Adultery plays the kitchen, bigot cops non-fiction
The little man gets shafted, sons and monies drafted
Living by a time piece, new war in the Far East

Alô
Alô, tem alguém ligado aí
Na rádio a me ouvir
Se houver me dê um sinal
Alô
Procura-se alguém
Que queira ser meu bem
Se houver me dê um sinal 

Mas um ano que passei
Tanto tempo eu esperei
Pra falar de um sentimento
Resolvi nesse momento

Fazer loucura pra tentar
Achar alguém em algum lugar
Que seja tudo o que eu quero
Que venha pra ficar

Que goste de andar de mãos dadas sorrindo nas ruas
E pra me acalmar doces beijos molhados de chuva

Roedelius,"Most of the day, we were at the machinery
In the dark sheds that the seasons ignored
I held the levers that guided the signals to the radio
But the words I received, random code, broken fragments from before

Out in the trees, my reason deserting me
Oh, the dark stars cluster over the bay
Then in a certain moment, I lose control
And at last, I am part of the machinery

Where are you?
And the light disappears
As the world makes its circle through the sky",The Belldog,1984
Roedelius,"I was just a broken head
I stole the world that others punctured
Now I stumble through the garbage
Slide and tumble, slide and stumble
Beak and claw, remorse reminder
Slide and tumble, slide and stumble
Back and forth and back to nothing
Keep them tidy, keep them humble.


Chop and change to cut the corners
Sharp as razors shiny razors
Stranded on a world that's dying
Never moving, hardly trying.


I was just a broken head
I stole the world that others plundered
Now I stumble through the garbage
Slide and tumble, slide and stumble.

Roemans,"Desert shadows creep across purple sands.
Natives kneel in prayer by their caravans.

There, silhouetted under and eastern star,
I see my long lost blossom of shalimar

You, Misirlou, Are the moon and the sun, fairest one.

Old temple bells are calling across the sand.
We'll find our Kismet, answering love's command.

You, Misirlou, are a dream of delight in the night.

To an oasis, sprinkled by stars above,
Heaven will guide us, Allah will bless our love.",Misirlou,1993

Roesy,"I was at a party and this fella said to me
""Something bad is happening, I'm sure you do agree
People care for nothing, no respect for human rights
Evil times are coming, we are in for darker nights""
I said, ""Who are you to talk about impending doom?""
He got kinda wary as he looked around the room
He said, ""I'm a minister, a big shot in the state""
I said, ""I just can't believe it, boy I think it's great
Brother can you tell me what is right and what is wrong?""
He said, ""Keep on rocking baby, 'til the night is gone""

On and on and on
Keep on rocking baby
'Til the night is gone
On and on and on

Keep on rocking baby
'Til the night is gone

Over in the corner I could see this other guy
He was kinda flirty, he was giving me the eye
So I took advantage of the fact that I'm a star
Shook my hair and took a casual stroll up to the bar
And as sure as hell this guy was coming up to me
He said, ""Who am I and who are you and who are we?
What's our situation, do we have some time for us?""
I said I was not exactly waiting for the bus
He said, ""If you're going somewhere can I come along?""
I said, ""Keep on rocking baby, 'til the night is gone""

The many pipers I have paid along the roads I wandered

I may have never found my way to you",On My Way To You,2004

For when my chin is on the ground,
I pick myself up,
Dust myself off,
Start all over again.

Don't lose your confidence if you slip,
Be grateful for a pleasant trip,
And pick yourself up,
Dust yourself off,
Start all over again.

Work like a soul inspired,
Till the battle of the day is won.
You may be sick and tired,
But you'll be a man, my son!

Will you remember the famous men,
Who had to fall to rise again?
So take a deep breath,
Pick yourself up,
Dust yourself off,
Start all over again.

If your endurance is great.
I'll learn by easy stages
If you're courageous and wait.

I must hang on to your hand,
Maybe by the time I'm fifty
I'll get up and do a nifty.

Nothing's impossible I have found,
For when my chin is on the ground,
I pick myself up,
Dust myself off,
Start all over again.

Don't lose your confidence if you slip,
Be grateful for a pleasant trip,
And pick yourself up,
Dust yourself off,
Start all over again.

Till the battle of the day is won.
You may be sick and tired,
But you'll be a man, my son!

Who had to fall to rise again?

I'm not sure of the words yet;
Huh, I'm not sure of anything!

Life is very rough and tumble for a humble siseuse;
One can betray one's troubles never, whatever occurs!
Night after night,
Have to be bright,
Whether you're well or ill;
The people have to laugh their fill,
You mustn't sleep till dawn comes creeping.

Though I never really grumble,
Life's a jumble indeed!
And in my efforts to succeed
I've had to formulate a creed.

I believe in doing what I can,
In crying when I must
And laughing when I choose.
Heigh ho!
If love were all I should be lonely!

I believe the more you love a man,
The more you give your trust,
The more you're bound to lose;
Although, when shadows fall I think if only
Somebody splendid really needed me,
Somebody affectionate and dear,
Cares would be ended
If I knew that he wanted to have me near.

But I believe that, since my life began,
The most I've had is just a talent to amuse,
Heigh ho!

Roger Chapman,"Went to the fortune teller
To have my fortune read
I didn't what to tell her
I had a dizzy feeling in my head

Said she'd take a look at my palm
Said ""Son, do you feel kind of warm?""
And she looked into her crystal ball
Said ""You're in love""

Said it could not be so
Not with all the girls I know
Said when the next one arrives
Looking into her eyes

I left there in a hurry
Much to my big surprise
The next thing I discovered
The fortune teller told me lies

So I ran back to that woman
Mad as I could be
Told her I didn't see nobody
How she made a fool out of me

At last something shook me
As if it came down from above
And now the fortune teller
And I fell in love",Fortune Teller [*],1980

Und wenn sie trotzdem drüber lacht
Glück ist leicht

Und ich weiß nicht, warum wir zwei nicht mehr die gleichen sind.
Ich weiß nur für uns gibt's wohl kein Happy-End.

Das diese Story niemals endet.
Aber wenn man mittendrin ist,

Und dann war es wohl zu spät,
Um nochmal in den Kampf zu siehen.
Wir hatten lange durchgehalten,
Doch dafür wird kein Preis verliehen.

I've lived a life that's full
I traveled each and every highway
But more, much more than this, I did it my way

Regrets, I've had a few
But then again, too few to mention
I did what I had to do, Isaw it through without exemption
I planned each charted course, each careful step along the byway
And more, much more than this, I did it my way

And yes, there were times, I'm sure you knew
When I bit off more than I could chew
But through it all, when there was doubt
I ate it up and spit it out
I faced it all and I stood tall and did it my way

I've loved, I've laughed and cried
I've had my fill, my share of losing
But now, as tears subside, I find it all so amusing
To think I did all that
And may I say, not in a shy way
Oh, no, oh, no, not me, I did it my way

For what is a man, what has he got?
If not himself, then he has naught
To say the things he truly feels and not the words of one who kneels
The record shows, I took the blows and did it my way

But, oh, my heart grew active
When you came into view

I've got a crush on you, sweetie pie

That I could fall with so much emotion

And could you coo, and could you care
For lovely cottage we could share
The world will pardon my mush

You packed up your things and then you said goodbye.
You'd think after all we shared, you could tell me why.
The flames were burning hot baby, too hot to hold.
Bu, now I see your love was burning cold.
But don't you worry about me.
I'm feeling sorry for you, and when I sleep tonight,
At least I'll know my love is true.
Baby I'm better than you.
I'm moving on to a place where love is strong.
I'm moving on.
Does this sound like a sad country song?
I dusted myself off and I'm back in the saddle again.
I lost in love with you bit now I'm ready to win and I'm moving on.
No more trying to win you back.
No more crying over what I thought we had.
When I said, ""I need you"" and that I was all alone,
Good old compassionate you slammed down the phone.

Save your ragged little mind.
You turned your love off like switch.
Just think of all this love you missed.

Tonight I don't feel much like writing a song
But I guess I needed something to sing along
Something that I could sing and I could cry to
A song to help me say goodbye to you

Love says we'll always have forever
Life knew we'd have just awhile
Greener pastures lie ahead of you out there somewhere
I look into your heart and give a smile

Chorus
Goodbye, goodbye

My answer for pain, she lies sleeping
Your remedy lies deep inside of you
I've always admitted the way you take things head on
Maybe someday I'll be strong like that too
I can't say that I blame you
I cannot say you were wrong
I never found the way to say this
So to you I sing this song

This song helped me say goodbye to you
I guess I finally said goodbye to you

And the tuner, it took a pair of pliers 
And lots of elbow grease

Like the light from a brand new dawn
And from that moment on
It was all for the sake of the song

She had eyes like fire
That burned for me in the dark

Shining alone on the shelf

He was 16 and did not appreciate the delicacy of a rose. 
A long string of lovers helped blur the line 
Between true love and lust. 
A teenage girl who's been sold short, 
Whose she got left to trust? 
The cycle of sin she found herself in once the word got out. 
It broke her heart to realize what they were all about. 
After she gave all she had 
They didn't treat her so well. 
Each time she went their way, 
Another petal fell.

Sometimes life leads you down a road 
That you don't choose. 
You try so hard to win but you still lose. 
Bottle it all up inside where nothing ever grows.

I have always been there when she's cried a million tears. 
I know why she can't see that I've loved her for years. 
In the fertile soil of my hands I know real love can bloom. 
I would give up everything to bathe in her perfume.

I've heard stories about the 1950's.
Rock'n'roll music all the way to the 60's.
Everybody says it ain't ever gonna be the same.

But way down South the music got the mojo.
It's all homegrown.
You won't hear it on the radio.
Call it what you want but to me it's the good old days.

God knows I can't stop burning up the blacktop
Chug a cup of coffee from the honey at the truck stop.
Our blood starts pumping
When we're out on a three-day run.
Johnny's got his guitar hanging out the trunk.
Billy's on the floorboard, I
Think he's still drunk; long road ahead, but already having fun.

Chorus: Living here in the Good Old days
While they're going on around us
Thinking we've got it made
When the music has found us.
Ain't no need to back track I don't want to look back.
Now we've really got it made.
Think I'll just stay right here in the good old days.

I know all about a hard day's labor.
This ain't work
It's like picking out a flavor at the ice cream shop,
The brunette or the redhead. I'm here singing on the local motion. I ain't getting rich
But I'm down by the ocean doing what I want
And right now it's the good old days.

Chorus

When we get old we're gonna talk about the good times;
Fat and happy, spreading rumors through the grapevines. With any luck, we'll still be up to our old ways.
But, we're still living where the music got the mojo.
I know one day you're gonna hear it on the radio.
Call it what you want
But to me it's the good old days.

In curiosity.

He sits so silently
And unaware of everything.
Playing poxy pinball,
Picks his nose and smiles and
Pokes his tongue at everything.

Light be enlightened.
Only if he's cured
Will his spirits future level ever heighten.

And memories, stole your time

Because there ain't no way I'll get my liberty

Now I know this is the greatest robbery

Night after night, I lie awake
And watch the morning break
Night after night, I get the feeling
That, there's no way back

Don't think you'll see me here again
You better find another man to take the blame
Ooo, ooo, ooo, it's getting late
I better sweat it out and get myself in shape

Time after time, only a fool
Would make the same mistake
Time after time, and every day I thought
I won't get caught

When she first came into her fame
And the avenger from Oklahoma
Was added to her name
The avenger she became.

She'll put you through a change.

He was the best thing she ever did seen
She was to be his wife for the rest of her life,
But she was so blind she could never had seen.
No! 

So she joined up with her outlaw
And headed for California. 

He treated her worse than she'd ever imagined
He didn't say he didn't want her around
He kept it up so long, she couldn't be strong
He run her right into the ground. 

After five long years,
He picked her up and slapped her down. 

Then she told her friends about him
They all were on her side
But she could see through the haze he looked so pale
She put her head right down and she cried. 

For her poor lover
She cried like a mother for her poor lover. 

And now she lives on a mountain top
And she's almost thirty-five
And she's found her peace and found her release
Happy  just to be alive.

Any way I play or lose
Any way that I throw the dice

Into night

Out of the silence
There's a hurricane
And all around me

And the wild man, he laid the thunder down.

In a sea of hands you came shining through
In the mist of time I can see it now

Under a raging moon, we saw Zion there
It ended all too soon, under a raging moon

We were out there
When they handed us the rebel's crown
All the headlines
All they tried to do was tear us down
But the wild man, he didn't fool around

Yeah you won my love, when the dream came true
When my blood ran high, I can hear it now

But my heart it ruled my head
And I fell in love instead!

And it keeps on getting better

And now you're wary, lock those fears away
But ain't it time you stopped running away from pain?

Then you'll turn around and say
Hey look, I'm the victim again

Refuges in a world gone cold
The voice of reason can't seem to find a listening ear
The vote is out, the bell still tolls
I can't shake this feeling, we're crawling closer to the edge

Yet we still go out, walk about, chit and chatter
Let the problems of the world go by
I don't really want to wake up to the pitter patter
Of little bombs falling from the sky

Tell me I'm not right
Tell me that there isn't any danger
Tell me in the dark of the night

From distant drums
The winds will blow
The dreams of man into the indigo

'Cause there's no turning back once we cross that line
And all your money in the right pocket can't buy you any time
A chilling wind feels so near, will I live to meet my darkest fears'

All my pictures seem to fade to black and white
I'm growing tired and time stands still before me
Frozen here on the ladder of my life

Too late to stop myself from falling

But you misread my meaning when I met you
Closed the door and left me blinded by the light

Don't let the sun go down on me
Although I search myself, it's always someone else I see
I'd just allow a fragment of your life to wander free
But losing everything is like the sun going down on me

There's something that's taken a hold of us
All that we say and we do
Just look at our lives

We run through the day
And stare at the night
Is your head full of noises?
For me, well, it's just like
The 4th of July

Maybe it's change
Or the time of the year
Or is it the way
That you hold me so near

I swear it's the price of love
Now I gaze at the lights
Of burning read sky

And keep hearing the sound of your voice
(Can't shake the sound of your voice)
As you asked me to stay for awhile
Just look at us now

The world let go
Our hearts showed the way
For a moment I swear
It was heaven right there
On that warm August day

Then you said to me, ""It was time that I go""
But time goes so slowly when I'm all done
I swear it's the price
I swear it's the price of love

Different emotions
For you and for me
So love is it all
That it's made out to be

When I look in your eyes
We touch and we smile
It all gets so easy
So clear and so wild

Tides rushing over these moments we share
I swear it's the price, I swear it's the price
I swear it's the price of love",The Price of Love,1990
Roger Daltrey,"On Raglan Road on an Autumn Day,
I saw her first and knew
That her dark hair would weave a snare
That I may one day rue.

I saw the danger, yet I walked
Along the enchanted way
And I said let grief be a falling leaf
At the dawning of the day.

On Grafton Street in November,
We tripped lightly along the ledge
Of a deep ravine where can be seen
The worst of passions pledged.

The Queen of Hearts still baking tarts
And I not making hay,
Well I loved too much; by such and such
Is happiness thrown away.

I gave her the gifts of the mind.
I gave her the secret sign
That's known to all the artists who have
Known true Gods of Sound and Time.

With word and tint I did not stint.
I gave her reams of poems to say
With her own dark hair and her own name there
Like the clouds over fields of May.

On a quiet street where old ghosts meet,
I see her walking now away from me,
So hurriedly. My reason must allow,
For I have wooed, not as I should

A creature made of clay.
When the angel woos the clay, he'll lose
His wings at the dawn of the day.",Raglan Road,1992

To get away with the whole damn big bang
For the right reasons, for what you can't take back

Until the drums stop beating
Until the crossroads burn out
I ain't a man until I've done it all

Before my time is up, I'll hang my name

Days go - so slow
Life just slipping away
Day after day
The wall's too close to me now
Oh I can't take too much more
All the lying
Is it just an illusion
I've been feeling the strain
And it's more than just pain
I can't help myself
'Cause I've lost myself

If I could see you through the wire
And just forget about tomorrow
No one listens to what I am saying
I'm just a sad man another sad man
They say I'm no bad man
But I'm no bad man

Wasted - wasted
All my life's been wasted
Sitting here in this room
I can never feel warm
I can get no release
It's all war and no peace

If I could see you through the wire
And just forget about tomorrow
Someone listen to what I am saying
I'm just a sad man another sad man.

I'll do no harm, 'Cause I'm no bad man

And as usual you're with someone new
I guess there's nothing left for me to do but turn away
I'm growing tired of all your alibis
There ain't one you can justify
I ain't gonna take it anymore and I'll tell you why

You think it doesn't show I figure let me go
If you're gonna let me down let me down easy
It's time you got it straight you know it's hard to take
If you're gonna let me down let me down easy

We've been going through some changes
And I'm well aware of all the dangers
Sometimes you look at me and it leaves me cold
But now you've gone and blown your covers
I know all about your temporary lovers
I ain't taking it another day and that's for sure

You think it doesn't show I figure let me go
If you're gonna let me down let me down easy
It's time you got it straight you know it's hard to take
If you're gonna let me down let me down easy

Oh when I look at you now
I can't believe you're leaving
All those years and you've got nothing to say
Turn around and walk away

You think it doesn't show I figure let me go
If you're gonna let me down let me down easy

Roger Daltrey,"The silence is saying there's trouble ahead
The pressure speaks louder than words
It feels like we're hanging on by a thread day to day
The closer we get seems we're further apart

Let's back off before it's too late
Since we know each other's lives by heart anyway
We've come so damn far and been through it all
It's hard to turn 'round with your back to the wall
And the tears rain down

It's a lover's storm
When the lightning strikes and the pain is born
Feels like another lover's storm
When the heat of the night keeps our emotions warm
It's a lover's storm

We've got to give in, try to work it out
This whole thing's dragged on for so long
But I forgot what we're fighting about anymore
Now I just don't know how much I can take
I'm bending so far, feels like I'm gonna break
And the tears rain down",Lover's Storm,1997
Roger Daltrey,"(Gibbons)

He speaks with a terrible stammer
So he don't have much to say
But he can spit further than any punk
So nobody gets in his way.

He knows his generation like he knows his ABC
He's a kind of kid that don't get invited back for a Sunday tea
He's a face in the mirror he'll make you a fight.
But he's alright.

He's breaking out of nowhere
He's breaking all the rules
He's got a passion for the fashion
He's freezing all the the cools
He knows that you don't have to be that good,
To be a real bad cat
He's built with speed,
Guaranteed to show you where it's at
He's blowing all the speakers making his own noise.
One of the boys.

(Guitar solo)

You know he used to work in this factory
Until the big boss said ""that's enough""
So he threw down his hammer and he picked up his coat
And he told the boss to get,
Fff-f-frustration with the nation
Because the news is always bad
Life on the dole ain't no good for your soul
It's enough to drive a poor kid mad
So who's going to put him down for making his own noise.

How in no time so it seems

The king found his queen
But in real life
There's only in between

That I should celebrate now she's out of my hair

Hanging around the same old parts
And driving in the same old cars
With the same old friends
Those weekends I spent on my own
At first I found it hard alone

Somewhere over there from the door of a street cafe
I hear that old blues guitar play 

I found some things of yours today
An old guitar you used to play
Threw 'em all away
They took me to another place
I smelt your perfume saw your face
With your hair that way
All that happened was a stupid mistake
I acted like a fool now it's too late
I'm another lonely guy with no heart for forgiving
Without you around, I find it so hard living.

They can't be seen with me and I'm gettin' real shot down

I went to church, I was incognito

And punched me in the nose

All aglow again, takin' a chance on love.
Here I slide again, about to take that ride again.
Starry-eyed again, takin' a chance on love.

I thought that cards were a frame-up, I never would try.
Now I'm taking that game up and the ace of hearts is high.
Things are mending now, I see a rainbow blending now.
We'll have a happy ending now, takin' a chance on love.

Here I slip again, about to take that trip again.
I got that grip again, takin' a chance on love.
Now I prove again that I can make life move again.
Um - I'm in the groove again, takin' a chance on love.

I walk around with a horse shoe, in clover I lie.
And brother rabbit of course you better kiss your, foot good-bye.

Roger Girke,"When I was a young man courting the girls
I played me a waiting game
If a maid refused me with tossing curls
I'd let the old Earth take a couple of whirls
While I plied her with tears in lieu of pearls
And as time came around she came my way
As time came around, she came

When you meet with the young girls early in the Spring
You court them in song and rhyme
They answer with words and a clover ring
But if you could examine the goods they bring
They have little to offer but the songs they sing
And the plentiful waste of time of day
A plentiful waste of time

Oh, it's a long, long while from May to December
But the days grow short when you reach September
When the autumn weather turns the leaves to flame
One hasn't got time for the waiting game

Say a prayer for the lost and the broken down
It don't matter where you come from
You will end up being from the wrong town

Just to have me a drink and look around
I went back with Deacon's daughter
She was looking for a way to get out of town

Everything gonna be alright
And the sun's gonna shine tonight
Everybody gonna come my way
And we'll understand it all one day

He was drinking red liquor from the floorboard
Said he used to have a daughter
Now he don't want to think about it any more

We went flying down a two lane
God knows why we didn't see the bridge out
She went down in yellow water
Now it's all in the world I can think about

I had a dream
It didn't make no sense
I saw myself tangled up in a barbed wire fence

Roger Glover,"I used to be a sinner, used to have my cake and eat it
They warned me of my fate, but I was quite prepared to meet it
You'll go to Hell they smiled at me
And told me of the roaring fires
But I was happy living wild
And fueling my own desires
I was a wild man
Drinking, smoking and messing around with women
Lots of women
No, not swimming, women

I wanna go to Heaven
The place to be is right up there
I wanna go to Heaven
It's gonna be good so I won't despair

I decided to reform and pray
Beg mercy for my soul
I prayed in church
Threw away my bad habits
Prayed out of church
Adopted an entirely different role
I gave my money to the poor until I was poor
But at least I ensured that I would go up there
Instead of down below to the Inferno
Where the evil flames of desire
Burned higher and higher and higher

I'm gonna go to Heaven
Paid my dues so I'm getting in
I'm gonna go to Heaven
It's looking good if I abstain from sin

I knocked on the pearly gates
Neatly side-stepping the long queue
Waved hi to St. Peter
Who checked my card and let me through
I smiled, threw my hands in the air
Laughed and got arrested
They said hey man, you're in the wrong place
Your behaviour is a disgrace
Here we pray every hour, on the hour
Read extracts from the Bible and look solemn'
What, says I, no party?
No party?
Let me out

Let me out of Heaven
I got it wrong, no I can't stay here
No laughing in Heaven
Let me out, I just can't stay here

Well I ran around in the state of shock and panic
This wan't what I expected
Here was what looked like a bunch of manic depressives
Can I get a transfer, I screamed
But no, once you're in Heaven, you're here for good
The good of your soul, but that's no good for me
If you want to go to Hell you've really got to be bad
Okay, okay, I'll be bad
Too late
What do you mean too late
Too late
No
In the meantime

Let me out of Heaven
I've got it wrong, no I can't stay here

Roger Glover,"We all came out to Montreux
On the Lake Geneva shoreline
To make records with a mobile
We didn't have much time
Frank Zappa and the Mothers
Were at the best place around
But some stupid with a flare gun
Burned the place to the ground
Smoke on the water, fire in the sky

They burned down the gambling house
It died with an awful sound
Funky Claude was running in and out
Pulling kids out the ground
When it all was over
We had to find another place
But Swiss time was running out
It seemed that we would lose the race
Smoke on the water, fire in the sky

We ended up at the Grand Hotel
It was empty cold and bare
But with the Rolling truck Stones thing just outside

Roger Glover,"It really was a meeting
The bottle took a beating
The ladies of the manor
Watched me climb into my car and
I was going down the track about a hundred and five
They had the stop-watch rolling
I had the headlights blazing I was really alive
And yet my mind was blowing
I drank a bottle of tequila and I feel real good
I had the tape deck roaring
But on the twenty-fifth lap at the canal turn
I went of exploring
I knew I wouldn't make it the car just wouldn't make it
I was turning tires burning
The ground was in my sky
I was laughing the bitch was trashed
And death was in my eye

I had started pretty good and I was feeling my way
I had the wheels in motion
There was Peter and the Green fly laughing like drains
Inebriation
The crowd was roaring I was at Brands Hatch
In my imagination
But at the canal turn I hit an only patch
Inebriation

Ooh Mr. Miracle you saved me from some pain
I thank you Mr. Miracle I won't get trashed again
Ooh can you hear my lies
Don't you bother with this fool just laugh into my eyes

So we went back to the bar and hit the bottle again
But there was no tequila
Then we started on the whiskey just to steady our brains
'Cause there was no tequila
And as we drank a little faster at the top of our hill
We began to roll
And as we get trashed we were laughing still
Well bless my soul",Trashed,2006

Roger Glover & the Guilty Party,"Through the cane field come a lullaby
Say a prayer for the lost and the broken down
It don't matter where you come from
You will end up being from the wrong town

I came up from Jackson Corner
Just to have me a drink and look around
I went back with Deacon's daughter
She was looking for a way to get out of town

Everything gonna be alright
And the sun's gonna shine tonight
Everybody gonna come my way
And we'll understand it all one day

Caught a ride with pulpwood driver
He was drinking red liquor from the floorboard
Said he used to have a daughter
Now he don't want to think about it any more

We went flying down a two lane
God knows why we didn't see the bridge out
She went down in yellow water
Now it's all in the world I can think about

I had a dream
It didn't make no sense
I saw myself tangled up in a barbed wire fence

And there's fighting in the street
And there's cocaine in the schoolyard 
Yet my heart, don't miss a beat
Can't let go, oh I can't let go

And the preacher's on the telly 
And he's handing me the phone
Got an ulcer in his belly and a torment in his soul
He can't let go, oh he can't let go

Everybody wants a contribution
Telling me they've got the best solution
No one wants the carousel to slow down
Seems to me we're heading for a showdown

And there's holes up in the sky
And the children keep on asking ""Is the planet going to die?""

Got to get fired, it's going to get hot
We got to take it higher, give it everything you got

But you're the joke of the neighborhood
Why should you care if you're feeling good?
You take the long way home
Take the long way home

But there are times that you feel
You're part of the scenery
All the greenery is coming down, boy

And then your wife seems to think
You're part of the furniture
Oh, it's peculiar, she used to be so nice

When lonely days turn to lonely nights
You take a trip to the city lights
And take the long way home
Take the long way home

You never see what you wanna see
Forever playing to the gallery
You take the long way home
Take the long way home

When you're up on stage
It's so unbelievable
Unforgettable, how they adore you

But then your wife seems to think
You're losing your sanity, oh, calamity
Oh, is there no way out?

Does it feel that your life's
Become a catastrophe?
Oh, it has to be for you to grow, boy

And when you look through the years
And see what you could have been
Oh, what you might have been
If you'd had more time

So when the day comes to settle down
Well, who's to blame if you're not around?
You took the long way home
Take the long way home

Take the long way home
Take the long way home
Take the long way home

Take the long way home
Take the long way, take the long way

And from a dark corner where walls loom high

Smoke rose up like serpents, I was barely seventeen

With a silver smile and loaded with jewelery to enjoy

A purple rose that was ignored

No joys for me, no company

I'm white inside, but that don't help my case
Cause I can't hide what is on my face
I'm so forlorn. Life's just a thorn
My heart is torn. Why was I born?

It's cooler than the street

Spanish eyes and soft brown curls

I believe I'm in the power of st. Lazarus

Roger McGuinn,"Eight miles high and when you touch down
You'll find that it's stranger than known
Signs in the street that say where you're going
Are somewhere just being their own

Nowhere is there warmth to be found
Among those afraid of losing their ground
Rain gray town known for it's sound
In places small faces unbound

Round the squares huddled in storms
Some laughing some just shapeless forms
Sidewalk scenes and black limousines
Some living some standing alone",Eight Miles High [Live],
Roger McGuinn,"So you want to be a rock and roll star
Then listen now to what I say
Just get an electric guitar
Then take some time and learn how to play

And with your hair combed right
And your pants fit tight
It's gonna be all right

Then it's time to go downtown
Where the agent man won't let you down
Sell your soul to the company
Who are waiting there to sell plastic ware

And in a week or two
If you make the charts
The girls'll tear you apart

The price you paid for your riches and fame
Was it all a strange game, you're a little insane
The money that came and the public acclaim
Don't forget what you are, you're a rock and roll star

La la la...",So You Want to Be a Rock & Roll Star [Live],
Roger McGuinn,"Darkness at the break of noon
Shadows even the silver spoon
The handmade blade, the child's balloon
Eclipses both the sun and moon
To understand you know too soon
There is no sense in trying.
Pointed threats, they bluff with scorn
Suicide remarks are torn
From the fool's gold mouthpiece
The hollow horn plays wasted words
Proves to warn
That he not busy being born
Is busy dying.
Temptation's page flies out the door
You follow, find yourself at war
Watch waterfalls of pity roar
You feel to moan but unlike before
You discover
That you'd just be
One more person crying.
So don't fear if you hear
A foreign sound to your ear
It's alright, Ma, I'm only sighing.
As some warn victory, some downfall
Private reasons great or small
Can be seen in the eyes of those that call
To make all that should be killed to crawl
While others say don't hate nothing at all
Except hatred.
Disillusioned words like bullets bark
As human gods aim for their mark
Made everything from toy guns that spark
To flesh-colored Christs that glow in the dark
It's easy to see without looking too far
That not much
Is really sacred.
While preachers preach of evil fates
Teachers teach that knowledge waits
Can lead to hundred-dollar plates
Goodness hides behind its gates
But even the president of the United States
Sometimes must have
To stand naked.
An' though the rules of the road have been lodged
It's only people's games that you got to dodge
And it's alright, Ma, I can make it.
Advertising signs that con you
Into thinking you're the one
That can do what's never been done
That can win what's never been won
Meantime life outside goes on
All around you.
You lose yourself, you reappear
You suddenly find you got nothing to fear
Alone you stand with nobody near
When a trembling distant voice, unclear
Startles your sleeping ears to hear
That somebody thinks
They really found you.
A question in your nerves is lit
Yet you know there is no answer fit to satisfy
Insure you not to quit
To keep it in your mind and not fergit
That it is not he or she or them or it
That you belong to.
Although the masters make the rules
For the wise men and the fools
I got nothing, Ma, to live up to.
For them that must obey authority
That they do not respect in any degree
Who despise their jobs, their destinies
Speak jealously of them that are free
Cultivate their flowers to be
Nothing more than something
They invest in.
While some on principles baptized
To strict party platform ties
Social clubs in drag disguise
Outsiders they can freely criticize
Tell nothing except who to idolize
And then say God bless him.
While one who sings with his tongue on fire
Gargles in the rat race choir
Bent out of shape from society's pliers
Cares not to come up any higher
But rather get you down in the hole
That he's in.
But I mean no harm nor put fault
On anyone that lives in a vault
But it's alright, Ma, if I can't please him.
Old lady judges watch people in pairs
Limited in sex, they dare
To push fake morals, insult and stare
While money doesn't talk, it swears
Obscenity, who really cares
Propaganda, all is phony.
While them that defend what they cannot see
With a killer's pride, security
It blows the minds most bitterly
For them that think death's honesty
Won't fall upon them naturally
Life sometimes
Must get lonely.
My eyes collide head-on with stuffed graveyards
False gods, I scuff
At pettiness which plays so rough
Walk upside-down inside handcuffs
Kick my legs to crash it off
Say okay, I have had enough
What else can you show me?
And if my thought-dreams could be seen
They'd probably put my head in a guillotine
But it's alright, Ma, it's life, and life only.","It's Alright, Ma (I'm Only Bleeding)",1969

Roger McGuinn,"The planet was molded from great clouds of dust
Then molten eruptions would burst through the crust
A new sun was shining and covered the earth

The seas were forming before life began
It would take a long time to crawl on the land
The rivers were waiting for the arrival
The lowlands provided a place of survival

Man cam from the mud and the ooze and the slime
An integral part of a master design
He gazed at the stars and the moon in the sky
Some knew they were going and some wondered why

Man made a beginning and went to the moon
A few fellow creatures predicted earth's doom
His colonisation out into space is more than 
A great leap for the whole human race

Some dream of a journey to the neighboring star
And some will not listen, they say it's too far
He'll create a machine and launch it someday
To reach Alpha Centauri four light years away

Then evolve to the stars of our galaxy
And write a new chapter of man's destiny
Man came from the mude and the ooze and the slime
An integral part of a master design",Time Cube,1973
Roger McGuinn,"Jamaica was the lovely one, I played her well
As we lay in the tall grass where the shadows fell

Help me find a way to fill these empty hours
Say you will come again tomorrow

She would stare across the water from the trees
Last time he was home he held her on his knees
And said the next time they would sail away just where they pleased

Help me find a way to fill these lifeless sails
And stay until my ships can find the sea

Beside the legendary fountain

You may lead me to the chasm
Where the rivers of our visions
Flow into one another

And I'll stay awhile and wonder
At the mist that they created
And lose myself within it
Cleanse my mind and body
And I know at this moment
As I stand in that cathedral
I will want to dive
Beneath the white cascading water

She may beg and she may plead
And she may argue with her logic

With Dreamland coming on

Dreamland, dream on Dreamland

Walter Raleigh, Chris Columbus
Come a-marchin' out of the waves
And they claim the beach and concessions
In the name of the sun-tan slaves

Like an Errol Flynn sarong
And I laid down thinking national
With Dreamland coming on

Goodtime Mary and the lady soldiers
Talking over a glass of rum
Burning on the inside
With a knowledge of things to come
There's gambling out on the terrace
Midnight rambling on the lawn
As they lean towards temptation
With Dreamland coming on

In a plane flying back to winter
With shoes full of tropic sand
There comes a lady in a foreign flag
On the arm of her Marlboro man
The hawk howls in New York City
Six-foot drifts on Myrtle's lawn
As they push the recline buttons down

On the sun on the Amazon

A brave son, who gave his life to see the slogan
That hovers between the headstone and her eyes
For they penetrate her grieving

New love, a boy and girl they talking
New words, that only they can share in
New words, a love so strong it tears their hearts
To sleep, through the fleeting hours of morning
Love is careless in its choosing, sweeping over cross a baby
Love descends on those defenseless
Idiot love will spark the fusion
Inspirations have I none, just to touch the flaming dove
All I have is my love of love, and love is not loving

Soul love, the priest that tastes the word and
Told of love, and how my God on high is
All love, though reaching up my loneliness evolves
By the blindness that surrounds him

Love descends on those defenseless

Roger McGuinn,"Smoky autumn night, 
Stars up in the sky,
I see the sailin' boats 
Across the bay go by.
Eucalyptus trees hang above the street
And then I turn my head, 
For you're approachin' me.
Moonlight on the water, 
Fisherman's daughter, 
Floatin' in to my room
With a golden loom.

First we wash our feet 
Near the immortal shrine
And then our shadows meet 
And then we drink the wine.
I see the hungry clouds up above your face
And then the tears roll down, 
What a bitter taste.
And then you drift away 
On a summer's day where 
The wildflowers bloom 
With your golden loom.

I walk across the bridge 
In the dismal light
Where all the cars are stripped 
Between the gates of night.
I see the trembling lion 
With the lotus flower tail
And then I kiss your lips 
As I lift your veil.
But you're gone and then 
All I seem to recall 
Is the smell of perfume
And your golden loom.",Golden Loom,1977

To your tambourine in time

The haunted frightened trees
Out to the windy bench
Far from the twisted reach of crazy sorrow
Yes, to dance beneath the diamond sky
With one hand waving free
Silhouetted by the sea
Circled by the circus sands
With all memory of fate
Driven deep beneath the waves

Roger McGuinn,"Crimson flames tied through my ears, rollin' high and mighty traps
Pounced with fire on flaming roads using ideas as my maps
""We'll meet on edges, soon,"" said I, proud 'neath heated brow
Ah, but I was so much older then, I'm younger than that now

Half-wracked prejudice leaped forth, ""rip down all hate,"" I screamed
Lies that life is black and white spoke from my skull, I dreamed
Romantic facts of musketeers foundationed deep, somehow
Ah, but I was so much older then, I'm younger than that now

Girls' faces formed the forward path from phony jealousy
To memorizing politics of ancient history
Flung down by corpse evangelists, unthought of, though somehow
Ah, but I was so much older then. I'm younger than that now

A self-ordained professor's tongue too serious to fool
Spouted out that liberty is just equality in school
""Equality,"" I spoke the word as if a wedding vow
Ah, but I was so much older then, I'm younger than that now

In a soldier's stance, I aimed my hand at the mongrel dogs who teach
Fearing not that I'd become my enemy in the instant that I preach
My existence led by confusion boats, mutiny from stern to bow
Ah, but I was so much older then, I'm younger than that now

Yes, my guard stood hard when abstract threats too noble to neglect
Deceived me into thinking I had something to protect
Good and bad, I define these terms quite clear, no doubt, somehow
Ah, but I was so much older then I'm younger than that now",My Back Pages,1993

Then listen now to what I say
Just get an electric guitar
Then take some time and learn how to play

And with your hair combed right
And your pants fit tight

Then it's time to go downtown
Where the agent man won't let you down
Sell your soul to the company
Who are waiting there to sell plastic ware

And in a week or two
If you make the charts
The girls'll tear you apart

Was it all a strange game, you're a little insane
The money that came and the public acclaim

Sweet Annie was loved both far and near, she had friends almost all around
And near a little brook not far from her home the body of sweet Annie were found
Her parents now are left alone, one mourns while the other'n weeps
And near a grassy mound outside the cottage door the body of sweet Annie sleeps

Willie Moore scarcely spoke to his friends they say from the moment they both did part
And his last day was spent near his true lover's grave where he died of a broken heart",Willie Moore,2000
Roger McGuinn,"The Diamond is a ship my boys, for Greenland she is bound
And the quay it is all garnished with bonny lassies 'round
The Captain gives the order to sail the ocean wide
Where the sun it never sets my lads no darkness dims the tide

[Chorus]
So cheer up my lads let your hearts never fail
While the Bonnie Ship the Diamond goes fishin' for the whale

Along the quay at Peterhead, the lassies stand around
With their shawls about their heads and salt tears runnin' down
I'll never weep my bonny lad though I'm left behind
For there's not a rose on Greenland's ice to make you change your mind

[Chorus]

Here's a health to the Resolution likewise the Eliza Swan
A health to the Battler of Montrose and the Diamond ship of fame
They wear the trousers of the white the jackets of the blue
When they return to Peterhead they'll find that we've been true

[Chorus]

It'll be bright both day and night when the Greenland lads come home
With a ship that's full of oil my lads and money to their name
They'll make the cradles for to rock and the blankets for to tear
And every lass in Peterhead sing hush-a-bye my dear

She was sitting in my kitchen with a face I can't forget
She was looking my direction and calling with her eyes
I was trying to do an interview and telling them all lies
Last year in the summer with a Tiffany lamp over her head

They were asking what I thought about the 50's rock n roll
Then they got into their limousine and fell into a hole
I moved into the kitchen and I quickly fell in love
The warden came along and asked me what I was thinking of
Last year in the summer with a Tiffany lamp over her head

Well I grabbed her by the hand and with a few things I could
The warden said ""You're leaving, well, you better leave for good!""
I made it to Tasmania to buy a devil dog
We were met by a young handsome prince, who turned into a frog

Laying in the sunshine drifting with the tide

I have visions of many things.
Love's happiness is just an illusion filled with sadness and confusion.
What becomes of the brokenhearted who had love that's now departed?
I know I've got to find some kind of peace of mind.
 
Maybe, the fruits of love grow all around 
but for me they come a tumblin' down.
Ev'ry day heartaches grow a little stronger;
I can't stand this pain much longer.
I walk in shadows, searching for light,
cold and alone, no comfort in sight.
Hoping and prayin' for 
Someone to care, always movin' and goin' nowhere.
 
What becomes of the brokenhearted who had love that's now departed?
I know I've got to find some kind of peace of mind.
Maybe, I'm searching though I don't succeed,
but someone look, there's a growing need.
Oh, he is lost, there's no place for beginning;
all that's left is an unhappy ending.
 
What becomes of the brokenhearted who had love that's now departed?
I know I've got to find some kind of peace of mind.
I'll be searching ev'rywhere just find someone to care.

I know I'm gonna find a way.
Nothing's gonna stop me now;

Roger Mcguinn's Thunderbyrd,"Well, she was an American girl,
Raised on promises 
She couldn't help thinking 
That there was a little more to life
Somewhere else
After all it was a great big world
With lots of places to run to
And if she had to die
Tryin', she had one little promise 
She was gonna keep 
Oh yeah, alright, 
Take it easy, baby 
Make it last all night
She was an American girl.

Well, it was kind of cold that night, 
She stood alone on the balcony 
Yeah, she could hear the cars roll by,
Out on four forty one like
Waves crashing on the beach,
And for one des'rate moment there 
He crept back in her memory

When something that's so close 
Is still so far out of reach",American Girl,
Roger Mcguinn's Thunderbyrd,"Smoky autumn night, 
Stars up in the sky,
I see the sailin' boats 
Across the bay go by.
Eucalyptus trees hang above the street
And then I turn my head, 
For you're approachin' me.
Moonlight on the water, 
Fisherman's daughter, 
Floatin' in to my room
With a golden loom.

First we wash our feet 
Near the immortal shrine
And then our shadows meet 
And then we drink the wine.
I see the hungry clouds up above your face
And then the tears roll down, 
What a bitter taste.
And then you drift away 
On a summer's day where 
The wildflowers bloom 
With your golden loom.

I walk across the bridge 
In the dismal light
Where all the cars are stripped 
Between the gates of night.
I see the trembling lion 
With the lotus flower tail
And then I kiss your lips 
As I lift your veil.
But you're gone and then 
All I seem to recall 
Is the smell of perfume
And your golden loom.",Golden Loom,

And then realized it was still dark outside
It was a light coming down from the sky

Those saucer shaped lights put people uptight
Leave blue green footprints that glow in the dark

It's foolproof, well, it's foolhardy, maybe, but who knows?

All it takes is

One dyin' and a buryin', one dyin' and a buryin'
Some cryin', six carryin' me
I wanna be free
Oh-ho, I want to be free

Free from all this heartache and regret
And free from pinin' for the love I can't forget
The love that once was warm and then just somehow turned to hate
Made my life a prison from which there's only one escape

Roger Miller,"It's knowing that your door is always open
And your path is free to walk
That makes me tend to leave my sleeping bag
Rolled up and stashed behind your couch

And it's knowing I'm not shacked by forgotten words and bons
And the ink stains that have dried upon some line
That keeps you in the back roads by the rivers of my mem'ry
That keeps you ever gentle on my mind

It's not clinging to the rocks and I'd be planted
On their columns, now that binds me
Or somethin' that somebody said because
They thought we fit together walking

It's just knowin' that the world will not be cursin' or forgiving
When I walk along some railroad track and find
That you're movin' on the back roads by the rivers of my mem'ry
And for hours you're just gentle on my mind

Though the wheet fields and the clothes lines
And the junk yards and the highways come between us
And some other woman cryin' to her mother
'Cause she turned and I was gone

I still might run in silence, tears of joy might stain my face
And a summer sun might burn me till I'm blind
But not to where I cannot see you walking on the back roads
By the rivers flowin' gentle on my mind

I dipped my cup of soap back from a gurglin'
Cracklin' caltron in some train yard
My beard a roughen coal pile
And a dirty hat pulled low across my face

Through cupped hands 'round a tin
Can I pretend I hold you to my breast and find
That you're waving from the back roads by the rivers of my mem'ry?
Ever smiling, ever gentle on my mind

Colonel Maggie is my friend with good old motherly sweet sympathy

Flat down on the street with a bottle at my feet
Gutter life and wine was all I craved
Then she came up to me from the Salvation Army
She thought that I was good enough to save

Colonel Maggie is my friend she tried to put some pride back into me
Colonel Maggie is my friend with good old motherly sweet sympathy

She helped me to my feet and she got me off the street
I was far too sick to look ashamed
Some soup and hot tea and a blanket over me
And when we talked she called me by my name

Well that was years ago now I don't drink no more
And rest her soul old Maggies dead and gone
And when my will-powers weak I walk back to that street

Roger Miller,"See the ruin on the hill where the smoke is hanging still
Like an echo of an age long forgotten
There's a story of a home crushed beneath those blackened stones
And the roof that fell before the beams were rotten
Seems old Darby loved his wife and he labored all his life
To provide her with material possessions
And he built for her a home of the finest wood and stone
And the building soon became his sole obsession
Oh it took three hundred days for the timbers to be raised
And the silhouette was seen for miles around
And the gables reached as high as the eagles in the sky
But it only took one night to bring it down when Darby's castle tumbled to the ground

Though they shared the common bed there was precious little said
In the moments that were set aside for sleeping
For his busy dreams were filled with the rooms he'd yet to build
And he never heard young Helen Darby weeping
Then one night he heard the sound as he laid his pencil down
And he traced it to her door and turned the handle
And the pale light of the moon through the window of the room
Split the shadows where two bodies lay in tangle
Oh it took three hundred days",Darby's Castle,1970

Roger Miller,"He was born one mornin'
It was cold and it was snowin'
And from the start he never had a chance
And though the doctors said he couldn't live
His mama had some faith to give
And they brought him to her and his mama named him Vance

He was sick a long time then
I used to sit by him
I'd rub his head and he would squeeze my hand
But he never cried, he'd grit his teeth and smile at me
'Cause he couldn't speak
And that's when I began to respect the little man
And I think Vance was three right about then

He started school and one day
He came home and at the doorway I could tell
The little man didn't want to come inside
He had met a girl but her boyfriend Smitty
Had caught him walkin' home with her
And nearly killed Vance
But then Vance never cried
And the only thing that Smitty hurt was pride

And he said

""Papa do you become a man when you're twenty-one?""
And I said ""Age doesn't make a man a man, my son""

He looked at me so puzzled with eyes so young and kind
'n' I think Vance was seven about that time

I guess they say that first love is the very best
At least it was with Vance
'Cause he'd scratched ""Becky"" on his desk
But Becky went with Smitty and Vance was very small
And he used to dream what it'd be like to be tall
And then a few years later Vance came in one day
And told me and his mama that he had to go away
To be fitted for a uniform
And though his mama shed a tear
He kissed her and said he'd see us in two years
And he looked at me and said ""Papa, I'm gonna be a man""

Well, two years to the day
Vance came walkin' in the driveway and
I didn't recognize him from his size till he got near
He came in and he hugged his mama
And said ""Hey, Papa, little man, want to go with me somewhere 'n' grab a beer?""
So we're sittin' at this table when
This fella at the bar started buggin' Vance
Callin' him ""Soldier""
But Vance kept his cool
And he said ""Papa, that guy is Smitty and he's to be pitied now
'Cause that's the same guy that used to bully me in school.""

Then Smitty said the wrong thing
When he brought up Becky's name 'n'
Vance finally stood and said ""Boy, what did you say?""
And it did my heart so much good when Vance hit ole Smitty
And it took two of Smitty's friends to carry him away

Well, Vance left the very next mornin' 'n'
It was cold and it was snowin'
And from the first, life hadn't been much fun
But he had finally made a stand 'n'
He'd become a self-made man and
Incidentally, he had just turned twenty-one",Vance,1970
Roger Miller,"Dear heart wish you were here 
To warm this night
Dear heart seems like a year 
Since you've been out of my sight

A table for one

But soon I'll kiss you hello 
At our front door
And dear heart I want you to know 
I'll leave your arms never more",Dear Heart,1971
Roger Miller,"Her head rolls back and forth
Against the billows of her long black shiny hair
As she contemplates the ecstasy
Of some other love that now she wished was there

If she could only realize that the love I have could beckon her command
Instead of laughing endlessly and pushing back advances with her hands

Every night I see her leaves a nightmare of illusions when she's gone
And it leaves a longing feeling in a man with a pain that lingers on

The gaudy goodbye can't replace the girlish giggle of her sweet hello
But tonight I've made my crumbled mind up that I'll never ever let her go

Too many nights I've watched her tease
By shifting all her weight from hip to hip
And with her hands brush back the falling strands
That cover up her satin lips

She struts upon the stage and her fallen victims are calling out for more
But she leaves them stranded helplessly and exits to her dressing room door

Tonight I'm gonna take her, I've infiltrated past the guarded door
But she just hurries by me carrying all those scanty costumes that she wore

And she asks a sawed off cigar smoking cat if he would open up the door
Then she told him to load the baggage
Because they open tomorrow night in baltimore

God' if I have to crawl, I'm gonna be there tomorrow night in baltimore",Tomorrow Night in Baltimore,1972

Maybe lay and let your feelings grow accustomed to the dark
And by morning's light, you might solve the problems of the heart
And it all might be a lesson for the hasty heart to know
Maybe leavin's not the only way to go

People reach new understandings all the time
They take a second look, maybe change their minds
People reach new understandings everyday
Tell me not to reach and I'll go away

Do the mornin's still come early
Are the nights not long enough
Does a tear of hesitation
Fall on everything you touch
Well, it might just be a lesson
For the hasty heart to know
Maybe leavin's not the only way to go",Leavin's Not the Only Way to Go,1969

Roger Miller,"Busted flat in Baton Rouge
And headin' for the trains
Feelin' nearly faded as my jeans
Bobby thumbed a diesel down
Just before it rained
Took us all the way to New Orleans
And I pulled my harpoon out of my dirty red bandanna
And was blowin sad while Bobby sang the blues
With them windshield wipers slappin' time
And Bobby clappin' hands with mine we finally
Sang every song that driver knew
Freedom's just another word for nothin' left to lose
Nothin' ain't worth nothin' but it's free

Feelin' good was easy, Lord, when
Bobby sang the blues
Buddy, that was good enough for me
Good enough for me and Bobby McGee

From the coal mines of Kentucky
To the California sun
Bobby shared the secrets of my soul
Standin' right beside me, Lord
Through everything I done
And every night she kept me from the cold
Then somewhere near Salinas, Lord
I let her slip away
Lookin' for the home I hope she'll find
And I'd trade all of my tomorrows
For one single yesterday
Holdin' Bobby's body next to mine
Freedom's just another word for nothin' left to lose
Nothin' ain't worth nothing, but it's free

Feelin' good was easy, Lord
When bobby sang the blues
And feeling good was good enough for me
Good enough for me and Bobby McGee",Me and Bobby McGee,1991

When all the trees and leaves are green
And the redbird sings, I'll be blue

""Some other time""

Then you laugh at me and make me cry
'Cause you don't want my love

You don't seem to care a thing about me
You'd rather live without me
Than to have my arms around you
When the nights are cold and you're so all alone

You used to smile and wave to me
And walk with me but now you don't
You don't want my love

Now ya don't have any time for me

You're part of me like kisses are a part of love
You'll never leave my mem'ry long enough to see me cry
You'll always be green pasture between the rocky roads I travel on our love won't die

Turning on the world, the way she smiled upon my soul as I lay dying
Healing as the colors in the sunshine and the shadows of her eyes
 
Loving her was easier than anything I'll ever do again
Coming close together
With a feeling that I'd never known before in my time
She ain't ashamed to be a woman or afraid to be a friend
I don't know the answer to the easy way she opened every door in my mind
But dreaming was as easy as believing it was never gonna end
Loving her was easier than anything I'll ever do again
 
Waking in the morning to the feeling of her fingers on my skin
Wiping out the traces of the people and the places that I""ve been
Teaching me that yesterday was something that I never thought of trying
Talking of tomorrow and the money, love and time we had to spend

Against the billows of her long black shiny hair
As she contemplates the ecstasy
Of some other love that now she wished was there

If she could only realize that the love I have could beckon her command
Instead of laughing endlessly and pushing back advances with her hands

Every night I see her leaves a nightmare of illusions when she's gone
And it leaves a longing feeling in a man with a pain that lingers on

The gaudy goodbye can't replace the girlish giggle of her sweet hello
But tonight I've made my crumbled mind up that I'll never ever let her go

Too many nights I've watched her tease
By shifting all her weight from hip to hip
And with her hands brush back the falling strands
That cover up her satin lips

She struts upon the stage and her fallen victims are calling out for more
But she leaves them stranded helplessly and exits to her dressing room door

Tonight I'm gonna take her, I've infiltrated past the guarded door
But she just hurries by me carrying all those scanty costumes that she wore

And asks a sawed off cigar smoking cat if he would open up the door
Then she told him to load the baggage
Because they open tomorrow night in baltimore

Funny I don't fit
Where have all the average people gone?

Some pious people point and call me sinner
Because to them I've never seen the lights
Other folks think of me as a preacher
I'm just doing what I think is right

The wealthy people think that I am a hobo
Lean and hungry, writing mournful songs
And the poor, poor people think I am a rich man
But really, I'm just trying to get along

Yes, it's funny I don't fit
Tell me where have all the average people gone?

And the government has given me a number
To simplify my birth and life and death
And still my woman thinks I'm awful important
Like the moon and the sun and the sea and the sky and breath

Yes, it's funny I don't fit
Where have all the average people gone?

Ruby are you contemplating going out somewhere?
The shadows on the wall tell me the sun is going down
Oh Ruby, don't take your love to town

It wasn't me that started that old crazy Asian war
But I was proud to go and do my patriotic chore
And yes, it's true that I'm not the man I used to be
Oh Ruby, I still need some company

It's hard to love a man whose legs are bent and paralyzed
And the wants and needs of a woman your age really I realize
But it won't be long, I've heard them say, until I'm not around
Oh Ruby, don't take your love to town

She's divorcin' me for reasons
I still don't understand

Than I've seen in years
And the story that she's tellin's
Even got the judge in tears

She's accusin' me of hangin' out
With girls of ill repute
Adultery, abandonment
Even alcohol abuse

I just heard my mother shout
Your honor throw the book
And even my attorney
Just gave me a dirty look

The kids and all the cash
Everything's coming up roses
And I'll be lucky
If I keep the shirt that's on my back

My head is buried in my hands

She got all I ever made
And all I'll ever earn

If I had a handkerchief
I'd break right down and cry
Why, even Johnny Carson
Got a better deal than mine

No name suited him, jim, jack or joe
So they just called him billy bayou

I whipped the feathers off of geronimo"" (i could whip..)

Maybe we could grab a bite to eat
And she drops what she's doin' and she hurries down to meet me

Guess you could say she saw through me
And hugged my neck

When flowers bloom and robins sing she went away

And headin' for the trains
Feelin' nearly faded as my jeans
Bobby thumbed a diesel down
Just before it rained
Took us all the way to New Orleans
And I pulled my harpoon out of my dirty red bandanna
And was blowin sad while Bobby sang the blues
With them windshield wipers slappin' time
And Bobby clappin' hands with mine we finally
Sang every song that driver knew
Freedom's just another word for nothin' left to lose
Nothin' ain't worth nothin' but it's free

Bobby sang the blues

Good enough for me and Bobby McGee

From the coal mines of Kentucky
To the California sun
Bobby shared the secrets of my soul
Standin' right beside me, Lord
Through everything I done
And every night she kept me from the cold
Then somewhere near Salinas, Lord
I let her slip away
Lookin' for the home I hope she'll find
And I'd trade all of my tomorrows
For one single yesterday

A kiss for luck and we're on our way
(We've only begun)

Before the risin' sun, we fly
So many roads to choose
We'll start out walkin' and learn to run
And yes, we've just begun

Sharing horizons that are new to us
Watching the signs along the way
Talkin' it over, just the two of us
Workin' together day to day
Together


And when the evening comes, we smile
So much of life ahead
We'll find a place where there's room to grow
And yes, we've just begun

Won't you tell me your name? 
Hello, I love you

She's walking down the street 
Blind to every eye she meets 
Do you think you'll be the guy 
To make the queen of the angels sigh? 

Hello, I love you 
Won't you tell me your name? 
I love you

She holds her head so high 
Like a statue in the sky 
Her arms are wicked and her legs are long 
When she moves my brain screams out this song 

Sidewalk crouches at her feet 
Like a dog that begs for something sweet 
Do you hope to make her see you fool ? 
Do you hope to pluck this dusky jewel ?

Roger Powell,"Keep your head and everything will be cool
You didn't have to make me feel like a fool
When I try to say I feel the way that I do
I want to talk to you
And make it load and clear
Though you don't care to hear

Couldn't I just tell you the way I feel
I can't keep it bottled up inside
And could we pretend that it's no big deal
And there's really nothing left to hide

Something sure doesn't seem right to me
When you can turn your back whenever you please
And you stroll away and calmly bid me adieu
Why can't I talk with you
And put it in your ear though you don't care to hear

Hear me out
Why don't you lend me an ear
You've got no reason to fear
I'll make it perfectly clear
I love you

I don't come whining with my heart on my sleeve
I'm not a coward if that's what you believe
And I'm not afraid but not ashamed if it's true
I got to talk with you
And then I'll make it clear",Couldn't I Just Tell You,1978
Roger Powell,"A million old soldiers will fade away
But a dream goes on forever
I'm left standing here, I've got nothing to say
All is silent within my dream

A thousand true loves will live and die
But a dream lives on forever
The days and the years will go streaking by
But the time has stopped in my dream

We all have our everyday hopes and fears
And you'll find no exception in me
But that doesn't get me through a sea of tears
Over life's biggest tragedy

You're so long ago and so far away
But my dream lives on forever
I guess I believe that I'll see you one day
For without it there is no dream

You're so far away and so long ago
But my dream goes on forever
And how much I loved you you'll never know
'Til you join me within my dream",A Dream Goes On Forever,1978
Roger Powell,"As the sun rises in the east
As the wind blows the fog across the sea
As the hand of Man creeps across the face of the world
Caught in a web of glamours
Persian perfume and oriental eyes
Yogi in knots and Sufi wise
Master sublime and swami high
Through in some Voodoo on the side
And a dash of the old Kung Fu
Lord you got me strung out on eastern intrigue
Chapter six and verse eleven
If you want to get to heaven
You've got to ask the Man who owns the Property
Ya gotta dance your dance
And do your act
And get His Big Attention that's a natural born fact
I'm on my knees, one question please
Will the real God please stand up?
Jesus and Moses, Mohammed, and Sri Krishna
Steiner, Gurdjief, Blavatsky, and Bhudda
Guru Maharaji, Reverend Sun Myung Moon
On the banks of the Holy Nile
As the palm tree sways at the base of the sphinx
'Neath a crescent desert moon many thousands
younger than ours
In fact, forget about time completely
Think of it in the abstract please
Think of the swaying tropic trees
One of your many destinies
Like having a hot peyote tea
In the palace of Fu Manchu
Lord you got me strung out on eastern intrigue
Sell your wife and pawn your heater
Buy the new Bhagavad Gita
Do the pranayama 'til your spine gets sore
I'll tell you for free
'Cause God told me
We checked it with the Pope and so we all agree
I'm on my knees, one question please
Will the real God please sit down?",Eastern Intrigue,1978
Roger Powell,"Power changes hands in the unseen worlds
'Cause in '75 something comes alive
Watch the silver cup and the golden rod
Silently listen and it shall be revealed
I was born to fly higher,
	born to stand where I'm standing now
Basking in the light of the neon fire
As it burns my useless body to the ground
Desire let me go
I would fly so high through the sky, never to die
Love has come, Love has come
Inside outside, it shall be revealed
Brilliant stars splash down across a crystal sky
And the moon and the sun and the earth are one
See the shining soul break the ring-pass-not
Spiraling upward and it shall be revealed
The spirit is free
The Universe wants it to be, It calls you and me
Love has come, Love has come
Over under, it shall be revealed
When the bells ring out
And the fire burns within and without
Initiation
When your star grows bright
	and fills all of the world with its light
Unification
Swallow your pride, you don't need it no more
Don't have to hide, all I am is only one more
Standing at the door
	waiting for the world's Initiation
Thunder roar and lightning crack
Snakes of fire dance up and down my back
A long, long road is behind me now
Too late to be afraid of the choice that I have made
But there's one thing I know
Where my spirit says to go,
	you know that's where I must go
When the golden ray
Of the dawn signifies a new day
Initiation
And when loves grows strong
And the spheres join together in song
Unification
Swallow your pride, you don't need it no more
Don't need to hide, all I am is
Only one more, then shut the door
	waiting for the world's Initiation
Over under, it shall be revealed",Initiation,1978
Roger Powell,"No place to hide
And no where to run
Nothing you can do because a change must come
You can't stop it
You got your tail in the air
Your head in the ground
Money, money, money makes your world go 'round
You can't stop it
You can't stop, you can't stop, you can't stop, you can't stop
You can't stop love in action
You just joined the clan
Your head's full of sand
You need a bunch of friends to make you feel like a man
But you can't stop it
Yeah, you could be the last trace of the master race
The Nazis really send you to another place
Still you can't stop it
You can't stop love in action",Love In Action,1978
Roger Powell,"I've been burned in my prime
The simple things in life
Seem so hard to learn sometimes
And it takes so long
Catch it while you can
Too late tomorrow
And everyone
Said we all know what comes of that
Living in your pockets and talking through your hat
But it won't take long
To turn your head around
Too late tomorrow
'Cause everyone needs the love of the common man
Turn the world around
Too late tomorrow
'Cause everyone
Everyone is waiting, just anticipating on you
Won't you make a showing everybody knows what to do
Take a dive from your ivory tower
And fall on everyone will catch you, everyone
I would be so pleased to spend some time
To hear a little talk about what's been on your mind
'Cause it don't take long
To turn my head around
If it comes easy
'Cause everyone needs the love of the common man
Turn the world around
Too late tomorrow
'Cause everyone",Love of the Common Man,1978
Roger Powell,"When I was a child
I thought as a child
I spoke as a child
I didn't know better

But now I'm a man
I look like a man
I'm old as a man
And I should know better

Got my head in the sky
And my mind knows what it wants
But my body just drags me down
And my world is something you can't see

But it's still very real to me
You can find it in the hole where I keep my soul
There it is - way down inside me
There's a real man
Forget about my body and be a real man

I see with my heart
I hear with my heart
I feel with my heart
Sometimes it works better

And some so-called friends put me down
And they pity me for trying
Bad emotions push me around
But the vision shines on and on

It will shine when we all are gone
And I'd like to add a little sparkle while I'm here
Light it up - way down inside me
There's a real man
Forget about bad feelings and be a real man

Some men's world is only hate and money
Afraid of everything and they laugh at nothing
And they only live to criticize
You can laugh at me now [ha ha ha]

But the time comes to everybody
When you must decide
When that day finally comes along
You might wish you'd been a little more strong

Then you'll wake up in the morning cryin'
""Oh my God""
There it is - way down inside me
It's a real man

You got to grow up sometime
Be a real man
Suffer them slings and arrows
Be a real man

Now be a real man
Don't sell yourself for nothing
Be a real man
Don't take no crap from no one

Be a real man
Get your trip together
Be a real man",Real Man,1978
Roger Powell,"Some people tell me that love is a feeling
Or a possession
Somehow it seems so cold
And when they say love is sweet,

Does it mean that you eat it?
Maybe you drink it,
Does it fill up an empty hole?
I'm lookin' for a love and I may not find it

You know it doesn't mean a thing
Without some action behind it
Please come home
I can hear them calling

Please come home
Please don't leave us all alone
Your mama and your papa are crying all alone
You better let it magnetize, learn to sacrifice

'Til we get the true version of
The meaning of the verb 'To Love'
What does it mean to love?
And when somebody needs love,

Do they spend some money?
Say something funny,
Ask for some tenderness?
And when you want to touch of love,

Do you lie on your back?
Stand on your head,
How do you feel it best?
I'm looking for a love with no strings attached

To take me like I am, that's the only catch
Please come home
I can hear them calling
Please come home

Please don't leave us all alone
Your wife and your lover are crying all alone
You better let it magnetize, learn to sacrifice
'Til we learn the true version of

The meaning of the verb 'To Love'
Does it mean any more,
The more you talk about it
Is it anymore real

If you jump around and shout it
I'm sick and tired of hearing
'bout everyone without it and
Too much talkin' sends me walkin'

Night is falling and everybody's calling for love
Everybody's lookin' for their one and only
It's only just a game 'cause they're scared to be lonely
Please come home

I can hear them calling
Please come home
Please don't leave us all alone
Your brothers and your sisters are crying all alone

You got let it magnetize, learn to sacrifice
