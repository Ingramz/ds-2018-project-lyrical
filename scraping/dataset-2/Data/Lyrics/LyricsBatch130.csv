Deftones,"She breaks her horses
With strange distant voices
That travel through the air
They travel through the air

She tames with her voices
As she plays around with the forces
That travel through the air
They travel through the air

Ooh the distant howling out
Keeps you floating around
Oh distant howling out
Forces floating around

She breaks her horses
With strange distant voices
That travel through the air
They travel through the air",Swerve City,2012
Deftones,"Take out the stories
They’ve put into your mind
And brace for the glory
As you stare into the sky

The sky beneath
I know you can’t be tired
Lay there
Stare at the ceiling

And switch back to your time just go ahead now try
And taste it I know it should be ripe, thrust, ahead

Turning in circles
Been caught in a stasis
The ancient arrival

Cut to the end
I’d like to be taken
Apart from the inside
Then spit through the cycle right to the end

I wonder just how you shaped it
To get back to your prize, thrust ahead

Turning in circles
Been caught in a stasis
The ancient arrival
Cut to the end

I’d like to be taken
Apart from the inside
Then spit through the cycle right to the end

Wake for the glory
I know you can’t be tired

Turning in circles
Been caught in a stasis
The ancient arrival
Cut to the end

I’d like to be taken
Apart from the inside
Then spit through the cycle right to the end

Inside, inside, inside
Turning in circles
Been caught in a stasis
I want you to take me
Apart from the inside
Right to the end",Tempest,2012
Deftones,"In the winds of your cape 
I’ve sailed with you 
From the shore to the gates 
We sway

We’re alive somewhere else 
Far ahead of our time

In a game of display we break in two 
We perform the ornate escape

We’re alive somewhere else 
Still asleep someplace new 
We’re ahead of our time 
Floating through

The sky is falling down 
This night belongs to you 

Forty years in the winds 
I’ve played with you. 
For the rest of our days 
I’ll remain 

The sky is falling down 
The night is calling you 
A star is burning out 
The sky belongs to you 

We’re alive somewhere else 
Still asleep someplace new 
Far ahead of our time now
Floating through",What Happened to You?,2012
Deftones,"I don't miss you
I don't care where you are now
You're a ghost to me
Left with my taste in your mouth

Take it away somewhere new
I've been used to it
This body is here but I'm bound
When I reawake 
I reawake in the waves
In a new realm
Just to strain my film 
You might just get used to it
And you'll smile (smile), smile

And I'll descend on these waves (hey)
Slip into the calming waves (hey)

Your known hex
That you strained my world
So I put this gun to my head
And I smile (smile), smile
And down deep

I'll sail along these waves (hey)
Slip into the calming waves (hey)

Deep into the calming waves
We have created now a god

Now I'll reawake me
Never full of myself
I'll grow out of my shell

Slip into the calming waves
Deep into the calming waves
Slip into the calming waves
Deep into (hey)

Right now
Bear witness, sleeper
Right now",(L)MIRL,2016
Deftones,"In the haze of your light
We bathe and wane
You've surrounded
Our hearts again

You smother me in shapes
In a secret praxis
You've showed me your charms
And revealed your name

Blow the clouds
From your mouth again
And smother me in shapes
You'll reveal your secret side

Your light will fade
And our hearts will sync
In time your disguise
Will shift and reverse

In the wave of your plume
We bathe and drink
You remind me of her again
Smother me in shapes

You'll reveal your secret side
Your light will fade
And our hearts will sync
In time your disguise
Will shift and reverse

In time your light will fade

Deftones,"There, bring your time
Say goodbye, now leave here
My fuse has expired
Fucking die, just leave here
Powerless
Stuck in your web of shame
Open your eyes
You only play yourself
Whoever's watching
I hope they catch the drift
Collect your crown
Your now the Queen of it

There, that's your life
Going down, I mean it
Loose and defiled
You define the meaning

There's a new shove
Don't deny it
Don't make this out to be something about you

I've been scarred
Fucking repulsed by this
My only tale is one I can't stand
Now I've become torn and I rot and wilt
My heart is black and I will never fail

There, say goodbye
Just retired from here
You've been exiled
Take your body elsewhere

There's a new shove
Don't deny it
Don't make this out to be something about you
Go waste your breathe somewhere to someone new

Your castle is burning, down on you
Your kingdom is burning, down

There's a new shove
Don't deny it
Don't make this out to be something about you
There's a new shove
Don't deny it
Don't make this out to be something about you
Go waste your breathe somewhere to someone new",Doomed User,2016
Deftones,"Hey princess, lay back in your chair
Show us your geometry, see if I stare
Pink cigarette, white see-through dress
And a black and gold veil
Ornate headdress, my temptress
Wield your stuff and your veil
Vows, secrets, wake me when
It's my turn to walk through

Caught deep in your every curve
Primed and ready for battle
Lift your veil now formulate
With the sound by yourself

As her words draw you in
Our faith reconnects
And our hearts, they collapse
At the words

Now come to me in your glitz and your glam
Place your heart, down step back
And watch this
Blank featured, vile creatures
Collapse at your ankles
Fire breather, snake eater
Relax as we hail her
Vows, secrets, wake me when
It's my turn to walk through

Don't turn around, look back to see it
Just hang on and formulate
And believe it by yourself

As her words draw you in
Our faith reconnects
And our hearts, they collapse
From the words we intake
And now relate like I relate
'Til your faith reconnects
Now relate like I relate
To the words

We are enlightened
We stare and behold
We commit to your being
We belong, we belong
Deep in your circle
Trapped in your grace
Wrapped in your prism walls
We will stay",Geometric Headdress,2016
Deftones,"Deep in this dream we are locked in
I've pulled you in
Now our bodies are wet
There is blood on the beaches
I brought you into this don't deny yourself

Smile, now you're all set
Surprise, you're now one of the gang
Take what you want to take
Surprise, you're now running the game

We lay in the gore of our voices
Oh we writhe in them
At night we assemble the hunt for out prizes
I hooked you in the way
You should try yourself

Smile now you're all set
Surprise you're now one of the gang
Take what you want to take
Surprise not you're running the game

Develop the taste that will tie us together
I put you in this game
Just remind yourself

Deftones,"Nothing can save me now
It's what I believe
The slit in the sky when you left
Is all I see

Nothing to sing about
I've bared all my leaves
No vision of dreams about you
Came true for me

Cut through
This razor wire
And died on your heart
Writhe 'till the end

Stuck with illusion now
I drown in your sea
I hope that you first save yourself
And then come for me

Cut through
This razor wire
And died on your heart
Writhe to the end
Break through
Collect the wires
And writhe in your heart
Writhe 'till the end

Deftones,"Inside of this all you create
You hide from yourself
You separate every belief
That is true and you spend your life
Attached to this poison
You don't feel anything out of the way
And its true that

You spend your life trapped in this void
Where you will stay always

Get rid of this part riding you
The same cold space
You don't want to feel anything new
You decided to spend your life
Safe from emotion
This way you'll never be harmed again
Or confused now

You spend your life trapped in this void
Where you will stay always
You waste your life relaxed in your void
Where you will drain all of you

You spend your life stuck in your void
Where you will stay always
You waste your life relaxed in your void

Deftones,"I kneel at the altar
Carve your name and
Hail to the gods
I've climbed your tree, I peeled your fruit
When I tasted your kiss

How amazing that you were sent
Like you were molded out of thin air
Now, I don't want you to disappear
But I want you to carry us out here

We sail through arc light
Attach the wings
And wait for the gods
We found your grail, we drank your juice
And we tasted your gift

I will wait here one thousand years
I will choose to immerse in your eyes
I've seen the truth and I know your strength
I have watched your great ascent

Now we sing
Now we sing your praises
And now we face the sky, the sky, sky, sky

On top of the crux
I've climbed every rung

Still in silence we don't speak

Rising up to the heat
I get chills down to my feet
When I'm begging her to stay
She just turns and says no way

She just a mad the up the crew
She doesn't want a romance

You just want it more and more

Leaves you yearning to caress
While she's burning like a fire
You're just melting with desire
You can look but you can't touch
And you just won't get too much
She's not into conversation
You won't get no explanation

Dehconte,"I am sitting
In the morning
At the diner
On the corner

I am waiting
At the counter
For the man
To pour the coffee

And he fills it
Only halfway
And before
I even argue

He is looking
Out the window
At somebody
Coming in

""It is always
Nice to see you""
Says the man
Behind the counter

To the woman
Who has come in
She is shaking
Her umbrella

And I look
The other way
As they are kissing
Their hellos

I'm pretending
Not to see them
And Instead
I pour the milk

I open
Up the paper
There's a story
Of an actor

Who had died
While he was drinking
He was no one
I had heard of

And I'm turning
To the horoscope
And looking
For the funnies

When I'm feeling
Someone watching me
And so
I raise my head

There's a woman
On the outside
Looking inside
Does she see me?

No she does not
Really see me
Cause she sees
Her own reflection

And I'm trying
Not to notice
That she's hitching
Up her skirt

And while she's
Straightening her stockings
Her hair
Is getting wet

Oh, this rain
It will continue
Through the morning
As I'm listening

To the bells
Of the cathedral
I am thinking
Of your voice

And of the midnight picnic
Once upon a time
Before the rain began

I finish up my coffee
It's time to catch the train",Tom's Diner,2005

Ma bouche tire une chicha remplie de pollen

Parce que le manque m'a rendu très prolétaire

This ain't no disco 
And it ain't no country club either, 
This is L.A.

All I want to do is have a little fun before I die
Says the man next to me out of nowhere
It's apropos of nothing he says his name is William
But I'm sure he's Bill or Billy or Mac or buddy

And he's plain ugly to me, and I wonder if he's ever
Had a day of fun in his whole life

We are drinking beer at noon on Tuesday
In the bar that faces the giant car wash
And the good people of the world
Are washing their cars on their lunch breaks
Hosing and scrubbing as best they can
In skirts and suits

And they drive their shiny Datsuns and Buicks
Back to the phone company, the record stores, too
Well, they're nothing like Billy and me

'Cause 

[Chorus]
All I wanna do is have some fun
I got a feeling I'm not the only one
All I wanna do is have some fun
I got a feeling I'm not the only one
All I wanna do is have some fun
Until the sun comes up over 
Santa Monica Boulevard

I like a good beer buzz, early in the morning
Billy likes to peal the labels from his bottles of bud
He shreds them on the bar then he lights up every match
In an over-sized pack letting each one burn
Down to his thick fingers before blowing and
Cursing them out, he's watching
The bottles of bud as they spin on the floor

And a happy couple enters the bar
Dangerously, close to one another
The bartender looks up from his want ads 

But,

[Chorus]

Otherwise the bar is ours, the day and the night
And the car wash, too, the matches and the
Buds, and the clean and dirty cars,
The sun and the moon , 

But, all I wanna do is have some fun
I got a feeling I'm not the only one
All I wanna do is have some fun
I got a feeling I'm not the only one
All I wanna do is have some fun
I got a feeling the party has just begun

Deichkind,"Wenn sich das Niveau hebt, und es endlich los geht
Guckt ihr, als wenn ihr alle hinterm Mond lebt
Spürt ihr den Flow, die Show geht jetzt los
Rapps kommen gross, es ist allen Recht so
Fette Beats kommen in dein Ohr wie Q-Tips
Klingt gut nech komm näher damit du Schub kriegst
Meine Crew frisst Mics zum Mittag wie Schnittlauch
Sogar wenn ich nüchtern bin kling ich, als wenn ich shit rauch
Wenn ihr Hits braucht, müsst ihr nicht ABBA hören
Denn hier kommen krasse Gören, die Mics wie Tabak burnen
Dieser Beat schlägt das Trommelfell windelweich
Denn wir lieben den Scheiß wie kleine Kinder Klingelstreich

Nicke mit dem Beat und beweg dein Arsch
Wenn das Deichkind am Mic ist bon Voyage
Bitte gib mir mehr von dem heißen Scheiß
Wenn ihr das spielt, werden meine Beine weich
Nicke mit dem Beat und beweg dein Arsch
Wenn das Deichkind am Mic ist bon Voyage
Bitte gib uns mehr von dem heißen Scheiß
Denn wir kriegen nicht genug von diesen Deichkind-Style

Check mal den aus, die Gören sind am Start, ja
Ohne Fahrplan, weil wir sowieso schon da waren
Spitzt jetzt die Ohren, die Kids kommen groß raus
Weil wir bei Showdown sind sag ich dir Prost drauf
Wenn ich los lauf, sieht es für dich doof aus (Wort drauf)
Beats machen uns Höher als auf'm Hochhaus
Ich bin so drauf, weil in diesen Kreis pass ich rein
Also nick bitte, Digger, falls du weißt, was ich mein

Nicke mit dem Beat und beweg dein Arsch

Jungs mit woop Style, schüttelt die Köpfe
Mädels mit Hot-Tops schüttelt die Zöpfe
Vier Nordlichter geben sich hier heute die Ehre
Also werft eure Hände in die Atmosphäre.
Denn das hier mutiert garantiert zum Dauerbrenner
Drei Deichkind Sänger, mit Nina auf einem Nenner
Brennen wir länger, 1 für Liebhaber, 2 für Kenner
Einmal drin, kriegst du nich genug wie Cliffhanger
Heut zerhack ich mein Blatt, als wär ich Wasser blass
Dies Deichkind, dies ist der Anlass
Also was Junge, was Mädel, gebt Gas
Es ist zu krass, denk du, schwing was du hast zum Bass

Nicke mit dem Beat und beweg dein Arsch
Wenn das Deichkind am Mic ist bon Voyage
Bitte gib mir mehr von dem heißen Scheiß
Wenn ihr das spielt, werden meine Beine weich

Seht euch vor, denn hier kommt der Frechdachs
Die Beats treiben, wie Cowboys Rinder in Texas
(Check das) Ich klecker mit Worten, so wie ein Dreckspatz
Und sage (Piep, Piep) Guten Appetit, wie schmeckt das?
Wenn ich traditionsbewusst, das Mikrofon benutz
Kommt ihr nicht mehr runter, wie Junkies bei Drogensucht
Weil der Scheiß nach oben muss, wie Piloten in Jumbojets
Machen wir im Punkto Raps die Tracks rund und fett
Ihr kennt das, also warum guckt ihr so verdutzt
Und tanzt so heftig, dass ihr mit euren Füßen den Boden schrubbt
Macht den Walkman an, wir füttern die Stöpsel
Also nickt jetzt mit dem Beat und schüttelt die Köpfe

Rede schon! Rede schon!
Immer wenn du mich allein lässt, bin ich hier und du bist weit weg!

Sag' 'n Ton! Rede schon! Rede schon!

Ich seh' dich schlafen, wenn ich nachts nach Hause komm', dich wecken mag ich nicht
Wenn du zur Arbeit gehst, dann schlafe ich
Wir sehen uns nie bei Tageslicht, selten bei Nacht
Dass der Job mich so ausfüllt, hätte ich selber nie gedacht
Dass ich dich vermiss', wenn ich am Mikrofon sprech' und wochenlang auf Tour bin
Sieht man an der Telefonrechnung
Auch wenn ich Dir öfter mal auf der Tasche hock'
Versteh' mich bitte, ich hab' keinen Bock auf Spacken-Jobs
Ich hab' den Kram den ganzen Tag im Kopf, von morgens bis abends
Und wenn ich einschlaf', quälen mich sorgende Fragen
Die mir den Schädel kneten, sitz' fest wie mit Knebelverträgen 
Und sehne mich nach 'm geregelten Leben
Statt dessen sitz' ich hier und schnack' den Akku leer
Wünschst du mir 'ne gute Nacht, sag' ich nur, Danke sehr!
Denn du bist weit weg, mach' jetzt bitte keinen Stress
Ich weiß jetzt: Jammern hätte sowieso hier keinen Zweck!

Immer wenn du mich allein lässt, bin ich hier und du bist weit weg!
Ich zweifel', ob sich das Gerede lohnt am Telefon
Rede schon! Rede schon!
Immer wenn du mich allein lässt, bin ich hier und du bist weit weg!
Weiß nicht, ob sich das Gerede lohnt am Telefon
Sag' 'n Ton! Rede schon! Rede schon!

Also, ich pack' jetzt meine Sachen und werde dich alleine lassen
Hier 'n bisschen Ruhm und da 'n bisschen Scheine machen
Muss dafür auf Achse gehen wie Truckfahrer
Ich mal' Dir zum Abschied 'n Gruß mit Wachsmaler
Auf 'n Badezimmer-Spiegel
Du musst jetzt für die Kinder sorgen und die Heizung auf Fünf drehen an kalten Wintermorgen
Ich wälz' mich im Nightliner, lass' das Licht brennen 
Und kann dann nicht pennen, wenn ich an dein Gesicht denk'
Doch wenn nicht auf die Bühne, wo soll ich sonst hin? 
Gehör' nicht zu den Typen, die mit zwanzig vom Balkon springen
Ruf' mich nach der Show an, frag'
Wie war's? Rede schon! Alles klar, sag' den Kindern, Papa ist am Telefon
Bei mir dreht sich alles wie auf 'ner Carrera-Bahn
Wenn ich wieder da bin, lass' uns nach Formentera fahren
Der ganze derbe Kram muss erst mal verdaut werden
Fehlt einem die Entspannung, kriegt man höchstens Bauchschmerzen

Immer wenn du mich allein lässt, bin ich hier und du bist weit weg!
Ich zweifel', ob sich das Gerede lohnt am Telefon
Rede schon! Rede schon!

Du bist in England und ich sitz' am Elbstrand mit Augenrändern, denk' dann
Verdammt, du kannst nichts daran ändern
Lass' dich nicht hängen, Mann!
Nun liegt zwischen uns der Ärmelkanal
Bei Heimweh bleibt die Zeit stehen und Worte werden banal
Lächerlich, an manchen Tagen fühlte es sich an wie ein Messerstich
An denen meine Laune dem Hamburger Wetter glich
Doch ich besser' mich und denk' an dich auf meiner durststrecke
Wenn ich mich durch meine Texte vor dem Konkurs rette
Ich bereu' es täglich, dass ich nicht in deiner Nähe bin
Statt mit dir am Frühstückstisch sitz ich allein vor'm Catering
Ich sag' dir jedes Wochenende Lebewohl und denk' mir
Scheiße, wie gerne würde ich in deiner Nähe wohnen!
Gedanklich bist du bei mir, lässt die Uni schleifen
Ich dreh' innerlich durch wie bei der Formel Eins die Gummireifen
Flüchte mich in meine Traumwelt und dann geht es schon
Doch frage mich, wie lang du's aushältst mit mir am Telefon

Immer wenn du mich allein lässt, bin ich hier und du bist weit weg!
Ich zweifel', ob sich das Gerede lohnt am Telefon
Rede schon! Rede schon!
Immer wenn du mich allein lässt, bin ich hier und du bist weit weg!
Weiß nicht, ob sich das Gerede lohnt am Telefon

Die gehen gut ab do bist extrem - extrem weggebombt wie bei Taekwondo

Bis alle drauf komm bis das Haus bebt
Weil die Kids aus dem Biz nich mehr raus gehen
Beste Leistung von den Typen die am Deich wohn
Mirkofoncheck eins zwo eins zwo
Schicke Fraun bouncen zu den fetten Beats
Aufm Kiez in den Jeeps da geschieht´s
do fliegst in hohen Bogen wir haben die Tickets nach oben
Was is los mit dem ganzen durchschnitt wir geben Stulle und machen kein Bullshit
Bin ich durch mit es ist Zeit zu fliegen
Oh mein Gott wie tight sind die denn

Refrain
Gehen ans Limit ohne Sturzhelm kannst do dir das bidde mal vorstelln
Kein Problem für uns wenn der Schädel brummt
Wenn Sebi dicke Beats in deine Vene pumpt
Jedes Wort is mächtig, rekordverdächtig
Wenn ich alle Leute die meckern sofort ins Bett schick
Steig ein und setzt dich wir gehen ans Limit
Aber bitte benimm dich bin ich schon da oder spinn ich
Ich glaubs ja nicht was wird hier aufgetischt
Nach der ganzen Rohkost kommt das Hauptgericht
Der Sound ist dick dreh auf den Shit (Noch doller)
Nachbar beschwert sich schon (Tja soll er)
Vergiss den Standard Party bis zum Anschlag
Hier kommt der Sound der dein Trommelfell brandmarkt
do kannst das Gerät nicht bremsen schon gar nicht mit bloßen Händen

Refrain
Wir ham nen dicken Beat hingeklatscht
Vierviertel Takt jetzt wird mitgemacht
Boombastisch wie unser Superbass
Gute Nacht wenn wir komm dann tut sich was
Samenstau wie auf St. Pauli
Dicke Boooms komm aus´m Audi
Achtung hier kommt die dicke welle wie auf maui-wauwi

Und siehst die Schwärme ziehen

Fällt dir schon sehr, sehr schwer

Und warten auf deinen Tod
Sie tun nur ganz friedlich
Auf dem Hochspannungsmast
Das Gift in ihren Blicken
Nimmt dir jegliche Kraft

Oh, du fühlst dich unwohl
Woran liegt das bloß
Der Kopf wiegt schwer
Und, oh, der Schmerz ist groß
Sie tun dir nichts böses
Doch die Angst ist sehr präsent
Da läufst du schnell nach Hause
Weil du nichts anderes kennst

Deichkind,"Wir fahren mit der Luftbahn durch die Nacht
Der Mond scheint nur für uns, gleich haben wir es geschafft
Und all die Probleme auf der Erde
Liegen für uns in weiter Ferne
Wir fahren mit der Luftbahn durch die Nacht
Wo der Sternenhimmel für uns lacht
Und all die Probleme auf der Erde
Liegen für uns in weiter Ferne

Von deinen Schultern
Fällt die ganze Last
Du spürst sie nie wieder
Die Erdanziehungskraft

Und sollt es wirklich passieren
Dass wir uns im Universum verlieren
Dann verglüh ich für dich
Damit du niemals erfrierst

Wir fahren mit der Luftbahn durch die Nacht
Der Mond scheint nur für uns, gleich haben wir es geschafft
Und all die Probleme auf der Erde

Schwerelos
Wir fühlen uns schwerelos
Schwerelos
Wir fühlen uns schwerelos

Deine Zweifel waren groß
Niemand hat sich interessiert
Du spürst wie es langsam leichter wird
Das schlimmste ist jetzt hinter dir
Du bist noch ganz benommen
Wir sind bald angekommen
Du brauchst jetzt nicht mehr zu weinen
Denn ich hab dich an die Hand genommen
Manchmal muss man einfach raus
Denn manchmal ist die Welt zu klein
Willst du die Unendlichkeit?
Dann lass dich fallen und steig mit ein
Ich zeig dir wahre Liebe
Und wie gut es tut die Faust zu ballen
Wir fliegen vom Dunklen ins Sonnenlicht
Bis wir zu Staub zerfallen

Wir fahren mit der Luftbahn durch die Nacht
Der Mond scheint nur für uns, gleich haben wir es geschafft
Und all die Probleme auf der Erde
Liegen für uns in weiter Ferne
Wir fahren mit der Luftbahn durch die Nacht
Wo der Sternenhimmel für uns lacht

You know how people have these little habits that get you down
Like Bernie
Bernie you like to chew gum
No, not chew, pop
So I came home this one day
And I'm really irritated
I'm looking for a little bit o' sympathy
And there's Bernie lyin' on the couch, drinkin' a beer and chewin'. 
No, not chewin'
Poppin'. So, I said to him, I said ""You pop that Gum one more time""
And he did
So I took the shotgun off the wall
And I fired two warning shots
Into his head

He had it coming
He had it coming
He only had himself to blame
If you'd have been there
If you'd have heard it
I betcha you would have done the same!

I met Ezekiel Young from Salt Lake city about two years ago
And he told me he was single
And we hit it off right away
So, we started living together
He'd go to work, he'd come home
I'd fix him a drink, we'd have dinner
And then I found out,
""Single"" he told me
Single, my ass 
Not only was he married
Oh, no, he had six wives
One of those Mormons, you know 
So that night when he came home from work, 
I fixed him his drink as usual
You know, some guys just can't hold their arsenic

He had it coming
He had it coming
He took a flower
In its prime
And then he used it
And he abused it
It was a murder
But not a crime!

Now, I'm standing in the kitchen
Carvin' up a chicken for dinner,
Minding my own business,
In storms my husband Wilbur in a jealous rage.
""You been screwin' the milkman,"" he says. 
He was crazy
And he kept on screamin',
""You been screwin' the milkman.""
And then he ran into my knife.
He ran into my knife ten times!

If you'd have been there
If you'd have seen it
I betcha you would have done the same!

Mit kersek, en itt? 
Azt mondjok, hogy a hires lakem lefogta a ferjemet

Yeah, but did you do it?

Uh uh, not guilty!

(He had it coming)
My sister, Veronica and I had this double act
And my husband, Charlie, traveled round with us.
Now, for the last number in our act, 
We did these 20 acrobatic tricks in a row
One, two, three, four, five, splits, spread eagles,
Back flips, flip flops,
One right after the other.
So this one night before the show we are down at the Hotel Cicero,
The three of us, boozin' 
Havin' a few laughs
And we run out of ice
So I go out to get some
I come back, open the door
And there's Veronica and Charlie 
Doing Number Seventeen
The spread eagle
Well, I was in such a state of shock, 
I completely blacked out, I can't remember a thing 
It wasn't until later, 
When I was washing the blood off my hands
I even knew they were dead

They had it coming (they had it coming)
They had it coming (they had it coming)
They had it coming all along
I didn't do it
But if I'd done it
How could you tell me that I was wrong?

How could you tell me

I loved Al Lipschitz
More than I can possibly say.
He was a real artistic guy...
Sensitive... A painter.
But he was always trying to find himself.
He'd go out every night looking for himself
And on the way
He found Ruth,
Gladys,
Rosemary and Irving
I guess you could say we broke up
Because of artistic differences.
He saw himself as alive
And I saw him dead.

The dirty bum, bum, bum, bum, bum

They had it coming (they had it coming)
They had it coming (they had it coming)
They had it coming all along
'Cause if they used us ('cause if they used us)
And they abused us (and they abused us)

How could you tell us that we were wrong?

He had it coming (he had it coming)

He only had himself to blame (he only had himself to blame)
If you'd have been there (if you'd have been there)

When he proposed he informed my mother
He was probably her very last chance.
And though she was twenty-two,

Who couldn't figure that out. 
So beautiful I'd never lived to see.

Well then to me 

That everyone is beautiful at the ballet.

But when my father came to pick my mother up at the hospital he said, 
""Well, I thought this was going to help. 
But I guess it's not."" 
Anyway, I did have a fantastic fantasy life. 
I used to dance around the living room with my arms up like this. 
My fantasy was that it was an Indian Chief

""Maggie, do you wanna dance?""

Deswegen soll ich tausend Sachen machen, jeden Tag 
Ich soll die Dinge lernen, um die es geht im Leben

Wozu ich Lust hab? Tut mir leid, mir fällt nix ein
Denn ich muss gerade wieder irgendwo der Beste sein

Andere haben Spaß, ich hab einen Terminkalender

Sie scheuchen mich, erst dorthin, dann hierhin

Sons of the night
And my memories echo back again.
Stranger that I am
In my own land
where no one will remember my name.

When you hear me calling will you be there
When you see me falling will you be there

Time was the force,
Brought me back on course
In the darkness distant fires on a strand
Time is my disguise,
Against hostile seeking eyes
and the waves wipe out my footprints in the sand.

When you hear me calling will you be there
When you see me falling will you be there

Now my time has come
Return into the sun
Cause I've always been searching for you

No charge no excuse
All my wondering make sure my aims are true

And I tried so hard, yes I tried to get out

Lonely, when nightfall takes lovers in it's arms

Then good luck it finally stuck like lightning from the blue
Every highway leading me back to you
Now at last I hold you, now all is said and done

So if you ever loved me show me that you give a damn

For I reckon that the sufferings
Of this present time are not worthy
To be compared with the glory
Which shall be revealed in us
Listen
I asked myself how did he do it?
Make such a sacrifice
And the ones that he loved
Wanted him crucified
Oh yea, he knew that his friends would betray him
And he knew that his blood would be shed
He coulda someone else in his place
But instead he said

Surely I can do the same

I might look crazy to you
But this is the way that I express myself
He's the one that saved me
From this cruel world that's crazy
And now my mind is somewhere else in Him

I'm gonna praise God while I got the chance

Got love for all my people
And we got to give it up to Him
See, this whip that I am driving
These clothes that I am rocking and the ice
It all belongs to Him, not me

You've done so much, much for me
I'm gon' clap and move my feet
Let them talk about me, it's all good You set me free
I'm so blessed just to breathe, walk around and just believe
Just look what faith can do for you

I'm gonna praise God while I got the chance

Got to clap my hands, clap my hands

Thank You for the air I breathe
Simple things You set me free
Through faith I feel You moving me
Got to clap my hands, clap my hands

Done so much, much for me

Deitrick Haddon,"You gotta sit back and count your blessings
You gotta name them one by one
Baby, you can't take the credit
For anything that God has done

I don't know how I made it over
I don't know how I made it through
You gotta sit back and count your blessings
And say Lord it's because of You

I know some folks so caught up in self
With their nose up looking down on everybody else
But as for me I gotta swallow my pride
When I think about my life tears flow from my eyes

I can't forget back in Detroit City
With my demo tape tryin' to get folks to her me
Tryin' to bring a new sound to this gospel game
Had people hatin' on me in Jesus name

And I could have gave up a long time ago
If I did, you wouldn't hear me on this radio
Couldn't come to your city and rock the show
I just want the world to know

You gotta sit back and count your blessings
You gotta name them one by one

I don't know how I made it over
I don't know how I made it through
You gotta sit back and count your blessings
And say Lord it's because of You

See you gotta give praise to the most high
It's because of Him that you can touch the sky
It's the little things we should never forget
While you're driving Bentley's and flyin' in jets

Who woke you up this morning started you on your way
Keeping your heart pumping each and every day
Who gave you power to do big things
I think we ought to stop and give praise to the King

It's okay to want your pockets fatter
But we gotta focus on what really matters
Like love, life and family
Want the world to sing with me

You gotta sit back and count your blessings
You gotta name them one by one
Baby, you can't take the credit
For anything that God has done

I don't know how I made it over
I don't know how I made it through
You gotta sit back and count your blessings
And say Lord it's because of You

He brought me from a mighty long way
He keeps on making a way
I gotta roof over my head
I'm still alive when I could have been dead

Over and over again
He keeps forgiving me of my sins
When I think about all He's done
I gotta testify that You're the one

You gotta sit back and count your blessings
You gotta name them one by one
Baby, you can't take the credit
For anything that God has done

I don't know how I made it over
I don't know how I made it through

Let me hear ya'll say...
I vote JESUS!
Can I nominate, the canidate, who's actions speak louder than His words? Who else would lay down His life for His people, But Jesus Christ? And I know you've heard...
How He healed the sick, and raised the dead.
Thousands of hungry folks He fed. All in favor of Jesus say ""I"".
""I""...
He's the only man for the job. He's number one in my eyes.
I vote Jesus, Jesus for president.
He will fight for His people, until the end. 
All of His promises are true.
Every word He says, He will do.

I vote Jesus!!
Now, every election. We look to man, and they always let us down.
We thought change was coming, with the last pesident.
We were better off back then, than we are right now.
And poverty, in our country. Is at an all time high.
When we're supposed to be ""The land of the free, and the home of the brave"". When we're still treating our people like fugitives and slaves. 
I vote Jesus, Jesus for president.
He will fight for His people, until the end.

All of his promises are true. Every word He says He will do.

It's nothing but greed
I should go somewhere and hide

Have mercy on me!

How could I be 

So ungrateful!
So unthankful!

I'm so ungrateful

You've given the gift of life, oh that's a fact.
What would we do, if You took it all back?
After all You did, how could I not be satisfied?

If you could only see what I see, 
You first must believe baby you're a star

You are only human, you're born to make mistakes along the way
And God has blessed you with something that is so pure.
You just need some motivation, and need a little push
To get up off floor and walk through the dark

Baby you're a star ooh.
Don't let her tell ya nothin' different, 
Than what ya know what's in your heart
Baby, baby, baby you're a star
You still can read to go, you got to take control
Baby you're a star oh.
Ah oh. 
Ah oh.
I know, I know baby you're a star.
That's who you are.
Just make up in your mind that you were meant to shine.
Baby, you're a star

I still call it safe, I would suck if I was umpirin'

I'm never callin' collect, I call to collect
My homie wanted a Chevy so I put my dog in the vet
Plus I'm so loyal that that paper, boy, is all that I fetch
Got the ball in my hand and the ball in the net
Bitch I'm the D, can't no offence dunk on me

I'm overrespected, my mama gated community's overprotected
So futuristic, I'm already over my next bitch
Reminiscin' on listenin' to 50 fifty times a day
Back when tenth grade was like fifty days away
Tryna get paid fifty ways a day
Used to put fifty on the layaway, now my closet fifty shades of grey
Twenty six and I done lived a lifetime a few times
From futons to Grey Poupons
In church tryna get a little savings, yeah coupons
I spit that A1 every day, I'm hittin' new primes

On your bleeder, ho, reason for all of this honesty
Honestly no honor roll, but honor the Phantom stripper pole
'Cause I'm a Linwood nigga, them young niggas say
Put a sack on your head, you bleed out like the reverend
And to think our hood harder then I might break the door
Know some killers pull the trigger for a Swisher and Molly
In a blink I'll hit your kisser, bet you ass ain't rememberin'
They say my city's tougher than two fat bitches scissoring
So nigga I'm a veteran, retire my letterman
I kings bout that scuba but I ain't get to no betterin'
Cough up a line, 313 where I'm from
Zan got me cross eyed like Bernstein’s son
And these niggas try to copy but I hold on this time
It's us vs them, Detroit vs Everybody yeah

Lately it seems as if it's me against the world
Like it was before my life became a movie
And they used to use my mothafuckin' trailer to tease me with
But I flipped that script like AB filler
Painkillers to pop that lid off that safety seal
It made me feel amazing, made me celebrate me
And if I may reiterate, I ain't even need a script
I ain't bein' conceited, but I made it to radio, eat a dick
I still never ABC the shit
Mainstream appeal and the skill is what made me iller
Since before they called Jay Dee Dilla
I was daydreamin' one day I would be the shit
And if I ever end up escapin' the streets I swear that I would stay here
Still in it, I'm crazy, I'll always be real
Don't make me steal an 18 wheeler
Break all of my friends out of here and take 'em straight to the Mercedes dealer
Peel off back to the same block that we came from, rampage
You crazy for me to flip
What's makin' you think I need a switch? 'Cause I'm Adrian Peterson
When he's raging and heated and on the way to go beat his kid
On the track I spank like he just did
(Detroit!) I can't never leave this bitch
Sick of bein' treated like me and shit, but Jesus
I can just see why people stop callin' me to do features
And them cyphers on BET 'cause if
I wasn't me I probably wouldn't want to play with me neither, shit
Seems to be reachin' this fever pitch, 180 Degrees in here
Trying to wait for the cedar chips
Mcs just bit off more than they can chew like a face full of Swedish Fish
Or Lorena with two penises
Hateful and genius, this inconvenience
And for the record, you won't want this kind of static
In your life, when I'm makin' you cling to it
They consider tryna reinsulate yah
When it's maybe in for another crazy winter
It's so cold in the D, it is as days begin to tick away
But ain't this what really made me into the angry bitter blonde
But ain't we sick of bein' underdog
Don't make me unleash this shit, release this Pit may even seem as if
I'm yankin' your chain a bit or maybe the way in which I'm sayin' shit
Is playin' with your relation, changin' it it's still the same shit and Shady's still a lady killer
Since the day I went insane and attacked the baby sitter
With a potato peeler and mushed her face into the entertainment center
It's like another plane just entered into Ukraine again
The Bermuda Triangle and attempted to make a safety center
Awaiting anyone who ain't affiliated could be danger
Did you make arrangements with the gangsters 'fore you came here?
And if they mention us

Tell 'em if they want it, they can come get that (Statik)
I swear I love my city, I just want a little (Statik)
See me, they salute me, they ain't ready for that (Statik)

Used to tap Dre on the shoulder like, ""Nigga come hear this shit""

Bullets, I done took some, crack, I done cook some
Don't you stand there and look dumb
Ain't no honor amongst thieves, especially when the hook come
Lives, I done took some

When I look around I hear something tell me
That I’m the type of nigga you could be down for
And I be hearing niggas say they gon’ kill me
And be the type of niggas I think I should make a move on

I kicks in doors when your rap bars is Iggy
I pull up floors and take them charges with me

You could be swimmin’ in the Hudson, it’s nothin’
Think I’m bluffin’? Guns cocked, say somethin’
Ain’t too many real niggas in this here rap shit
The industry soft when Plies getting slammed and shit
I feel like Mayweather in May weather
Whoop the white nigga ass, it might pay better
Got my Timbs on the gas in this grey sweater
Tag Coogi, I bet you’d be more cautious if you knew me
Your girl tryna do me, hoochie, groupie
She tryna catch up on a Gucci, baby, no, I’m out like Karrueche
Gave me that BJ so I slid in that bazooki
And that’s my I’m the dookie
You fuck me, I’m fucking your bitch, stupid

And I swear I hope we fucking die together
And I'll be loving you forever
(You're all that I need to get by)

I used to play hard to get, like a sample on a hook
We used to play with the pots, you told me you was a cook
I was runnin' too long, he was chasin', didn't trip
How'd he do it? I don't know but somehow I got hooked
Thug passion, he's so compassionate
MMG, yeah, that's his acronym
Call him D-A-D-D-Y, like I'm in a bassinet
He's in pieces, he be all up into my fashion shit
Poppin', rockin', my panties, they match my slips
Been through it all; I could give a narrative
No fiction, nah, we ain't no characters
I mean if I bust my gun, you gon' bust yours too
Type to double up, you know that I ain't gon' fuck the budget up
Type of bitch deserve it all, who gon' compete with her?
He use to have a cold heart (cold heart)
Now my ring finger doin' the double dutch

Let the dog roam, he found his way back
Loyal to the soil, I never change that
We go way back, I can take you way back
Used to ride Chevy's only, now we in a Maybach, yeah

Caramel, she ride on top like it's a carousel
So infectious, I'm addicted, how would she ever fail
All my works are classic, maybe this my Magnum Opus
Too focused to give pussy to one of my soldiers
The loyalty is deep, she my Meryl Streep
My Michelle, we menage, do that through the week
On the phone, she had me listenin' to Boyz II Men
I'm tryna be at all the dope boy events
Food stamps, now we dinin' on islands
Diced pineapples, now she's my piña colada
Put my coattail on my dog; I thought was my rider
Every day he wore a wire, just like his designer
Some things are meant to be, some thing are meant to be
The day they sentence me, show me no sympathy
If it's the Lord's will, so be it, that boy been a 'G'
That boy been a 'G'

Used to ride Chevy's only, now we in a Maybach, yeah

She full of confidence, we compliment each other
Got my pistol in her purse so she a cocky nigga
She tatted up and way too trill for cover ups
We both went in, that's even when it's one of us
We switchin' cars right before the summer comes
She my people so I'm beefin' when that trouble come
Kissin' in the club, I'm grippin' on your hips
I'm richer than before; I hit a couple licks
Travelin', I leave the keys to all the cars
The hallway just like walking through the rainforest
Before producers started sendin' tracks
Once was a dependent on her income tax
You did the math and said you'd give me half
It was genuine when we would interact
So when I got the bag, I had to double back
Let go a milli, shit, it may be off a couple racks

Tell me how is that fun
Tell me what keeps you goin'

Dazed in new wave, I'm just soaking it in
Funny how they said they want it back then
Once I got it, lotta shit started disappearin'

Anything negative ain't part of my plan

And they could never call me selfish
Gave chances after chances
Mama knows best, mama said they all jealous
And I ain't gon' lie
That shit is scary when the people that you love
Don't wanna see you flaunt
Don't wanna see you eat, they wanna take your porridge
Don't wanna see you different, they wanna see you normal

Deja Voodoo,"The night was black, rain fallin' down;
Looked for my baby, she's nowhere around.
Traced her footsteps down to the shore,
'Fraid she's gone forever more.       
I looked at the sea and it seemed to say,
""I took your baby from you away.""
I heard a voice cryin' in the deep,
""Come join me baby in my Endless Sleep.""

Why did we quarrel, why did we fight?
Why did I leave her alone tonight?
That's why her footsteps ran into the sea
That's why my baby has gone from me.
I looked at the sea and it seemed to say,
""I took your baby from you away.""
I heard a voice cryin' in the deep,
""Come join me baby in my Endless Sleep.""

There in the breakers I saw her near;
Reached for my darlin', held her to me,
Stole her away from the angry sea.

Deja Voodoo,"If some of ya'll never been down south too much
I'm gonna tell you a little bit about this 
So that you'll understand what I'm talkin' about
Down there we have a plant that grows out in the woods
And in the fields looks somethin' like a turnip green
And everybody calls it polk salad, polk salad
Used to know a girl lived down there 
And she'd go out in the evenings and pick her a mess of it
Carry it home and cook it for supper
'Cause thats about all they had to eat, but they did all right

Down in Louisiana, where the alligators grow so mean
There lived a girl, that I swear to the world
Made the alligators look tame
Polk salad Annie, polk salad Annie
Everybody said it was a shame
Cause her momma was a workin' on the chain gang
(A mean vicious woman)

Everyday ?for supper time, she'd go down by the truck patch
And pick her a mess of polk salad, and carry it home in a tow sack
Polk salad Annie, the gators got your granny
Everybody says it was a shame
Cause her momma was a workin' on the chain gang
(A wretched, spiteful, straight-razor totin' woman
Lord have Mercy, pick a mess of it)

Her daddy was lazy and no count, claimed he had a bad back
All her brothers were fit for was stealin' watermelons 
Out of my truck patch

Déjà Vu,"I'm a take you back to day one, livin' in this new york slum
It's deaf to the dumb, only break bread with some
Moms left at fifteen, had no American dreams
To this day I'm sellin' to my cousin, who's a fiend
No one would got me but my older brother
Little did we know the dirt we did fell back on my mother
But didn't care back then, that's why she left like that
Now my parents became the street, and it's best like that

Some nights I pray to God and ask him to pull my cord
'Cause times is hard like the opposite street'll leave you scarred
Street wise, with no respect for authority and shit
A chronic hustler of crack; a typical bitch
Raised by Madu, who strung out on a glass dick
But every now and then I blessed her with a hit
So she don't have to trick
It's prevalent amongst kids today
Hustle krills, stack dough, and everything's okay

[Chorus]
It's the emancipation proclamation under the self-devised guidelines
Of self preservation and starvation (I gotta live)
It's the emancipation proclamation under the self-devised guidelines
Of self preservation and starvation (and I gotta live)

My life in this world wasn't about diamonds and pearls
It was rough growin' up around the boys and girls
After daddy left, shit was a mess; momma stressed
But I give her an award, 'cause, damn, she tried her best
Holdin' down the household, barely had money to fold
Christmas time, cherished our little shit like gold
I can't front; daddy was still there for me, cared for me
But him and mommy breakin' up was like a nightmare to me

Yo, this is for the younger fathers and mothers, sisters and brothers
Success is nothin' if it ain't; if it was with the others
We gotta make the best out of this terrible situation
If not for us, for the younger generation
We gotta break the chain, and deal with the pain
For all our people that was slayed in vain (revenge)
For all our peoples that was falsely framed (revenge)
For all our peoples that's livin' the name

[Chorus]

Let me show; I gotta love L.O.D., they put me under they wing
And then I teamed up with the most beautiful thing
In the world, 'cause L.O.D. we all we got
I'm a fans and my mans keep it, like it or not
I know it hurts havin' to do everyday dirt
Police all over my back; feel like bustin' them jerks
When I'm my road to the riches, I stay away from snitches
And them bitches, and keep my mind on business

Life was tough, so I became aggressive like a pit
The only time I felt relaxed was when the blunt was lit
Thinkin' me and my team can be tight like the Gambino
Muscle in the hustle scene; respected like Leno
It gets deeper than the words of Proverbs
New thoughts emerge as I cop the squat on the curb
Thinkin' the herb; strengthen my brain like spinach
And heavy shine, flooded with ice might; reduce my self-spirits

Stick 'em; my life is so real it hurts
Like when I saw my pops bein' driven off in a hearse
Like when I saw my mother bein' driven off in a hearse
Like you school when the roach crawl out my shirt
Like on thanksgiving when we got free food from the church
Back then it was DJ Red Alert and Cool Herc
Rockin' been stripe knees and latigra shirts
Back then L.O.D. was puttin' in work

From the cradle to the grave
We all in the struggle, we gon' struggle, we gon' strive to stay alive

Watch each other backs

Till you see me hoppin out the Coupe wit E Sermon 
Or hoppin out the Keith Murray Suburban 
Or hoppin out the Lex Land wit Redman  wildin and cursin 
My thought process is mysterious like the Lochness 
My furious mindset is complex 
Killin shit like a carnivorous millitant prehistoric monster 
Comin to stomp all over you hip-hop conference 
Landed in an Unidentified Flying Object 
Turn you into an unidentified frying carcus 
The smell of raw flesh make you nauseous 
Acidest arsonist, burnin your bones to carbon and phosphorus 
My metaphors sting like after haircuts when 
The alcohol is applied to the raw skin 
So whoever want to battle get blasted 
Get your teeth enamel shattered, shitted on like Pampers 
You had a bad bitch, I left the back twist 
I stuck my dick in everything from asshole to the nasal passage 
Dug her out all day, then changed my sperm DNA 
Now she got nobody to blame 
I been spittin raw, what the fuck you think I'm livin for 
Throw me in jail, I'll do a prison tour

Wit they heads to big for they neck to support niggaz

Let me draw a brief description of what happened 
I was rappin, niggaz got the scrappin, guns got the clappin 
Three-fifty-seven degrees I was separated 
Have bullets deflected metal, bodies decapitated 
GUSH!! a nigga got struck as I look 
I caught the next guy runnin by wit the metal hook (BOO-AHH!!) 
Blew his back open, blood gushed on my face 
A bitch fainted 'cause she seen I enjoyed the taste 
The case is that I split your melon 
And feed it to the jigga-boos wit fried chicken wings 
I'm wildin for Long Island, I turned and took Charles Ferguson 
And open fire on any trains now 
You may never know who's in your shadow 
You punk ass niggaz just best stay shallow 
And hollow, if you want to live to see tomorrow 
'cause ain't no sun comin out tomorrow 
Yo, I might do something y'all niggaz might regret like 
Blast you in your face and disregard your vest 
I'm pissin and dissin off of recognition and niggaz to listen 
Just to let you pussies know how I'm livin 
'cause I Return like the Jedi, wit my dead eye 
Leave niggaz to die, peace to niggaz up in Bed-Stuy 
Oh-ah, this that type of shit that make them niggaz want to wet it 
Word up, got me ready to set it 
 
Seems I steps wit aggression 
To any bitch who think they nice in this profession 
What? what you think your wrecking? 
I break your stlye down to little fragments 
The pain is permanent, so spare yourself the embarrassment 
Buck-fifty 'cross the face 
Followed by knife wounds to the chest for you attempt to retaliate 
I noticed all you bitches flows is based around clothes 
But Deja Vu got something for you stankin hoes

Before the thought even finishes 
I want to see red, blood from a chicken head

Déjà Vu,"It's amazing how you can speak right to my heart
Without saying a word you can light up the dark
Try as I may I could never explain
What I hear when you don't say a thing

The smile on your face lets me know that you need me
There's a truth in your eyes saying you'll never leave me
A touch of your hand says you'll catch me if ever I fall
Now you say it best, when you say nothing at all

All day long I can hear people talking out loud
But when you hold me near you drown out the crowd
Old Mister Webster could never define
What's being said between your heart and mine

Just let you leave without a trace?
When I stand here taking every breath with you, ooh ooh
You're the only one who really knew me at all

How can you just walk away from me
When all I can do is watch you leave?
'Cause we've shared the laughter and the pain
And even shared the tears
You're the only one who really knew me at all

So take a look at me now
Well there's just an empty space
And there's nothing left here to remind me
Just the memory of your face
Take a look at me now

Well there's just an empty space
And you coming back to me is against the odds
And that's what I've got to face, oh

I wish I could just make you turn around
Turn around and see me cry
There's so much I need to say to you
So many reasons why
You're the only one who really knew me at all

So take a look at me now
Well there's just an empty space
And there's nothing left here to remind me
Just the memory of your face

Take a look at me now
Well there's just an empty space
But to wait for you is all I can do
And that's what I've got to face

Take a good look at me now
'Cause I'll still be standing here
And you coming back to me is against the odds
And it's what I've got to face
Take a look at me now",Against All Odds [Definitive Mix],2005

Love came, planning to stay
Green Dolphin Street supplied the setting
The setting for nights beyond forgetting
And through these moments apart memories live in my heart

Look who's got you goin' crazy again

I'm a trend, I set one every time I'm in
I go out and just come back full circle again
You a fad, that means you're something that we already had
But once you're gone, you don't come back, too bad

You're off the map now, radar can't even find you

When Dr. Dre say crunk, you will get it crunk, get it crunk
Crunk, crunk, crunk
And when 50 Cent says jump, you get on one foot and jump
Jump, jump, jump, jump

The buzz is tremendous, we drop you all to sense it
I don't gotta promote it for you to know that doc is off the benches
We keep the party rockin' off the henges
We ain't showin' off, we just goin' off popular consensus

But critics say that Doc is soft, Doc is talk
Doc is all washed up, knock it off, who the fuck is Doc impressin'?
Doc is this, Doc is that, you got the wrong impression
You must be on the cock of Doc, 'cause Doc left you all guessin'

So DJ take the needle and just drop it on the record, what
We gon' have this mutherfucker hoppin' in a second, bump. bump
That's why we always save the best cut last
To make you scratch and itch for it like fresh cut grass

'Cause we done swam with the sharks, wrestle with alligators
Spoke to a generation of angry teenagers
Whom if it wasn't for rap to bridge the gap
Maybe raised to be racist

Who may have never got to see our faces
Grace the cover of Rolling Stone pages
Broke down barriers of language and races

Just call on the cape crusaders
And leave it to me and Dre to pass the mic
And we can play the back and forth all day
Like the hot potato game, that's why we came to

Bounce now, hands up, you know how we do
We make the club jump everywhere we go
It's no secret, everybody know
When Dre's involved, there's plenty money involved

And plenty honey's involved
The sunny Sunday's and palm trees
Cali, everyday it's just another party from the valley's
All the way to them 8 Mile alleys, let's rally

Hands up for the grand finale
Now raise up out your seat, Dre is about to speak
Blaze a pound of weed six days up out the week

You could catch me in the studio bangin' out the beats to
Provide you with the heat that keep blazin' out your speaker

So never say never 'cause Shady Aftermath together
Along with G-Unit Records presents the return
Of the-the Doc and Shady, no one could do it better
We tear the club up and leave without a strand of evidence and uh

Paradise to live

I know why I've waited
Know why I've been blue

Why should we spend money
On a show or two
No one does those love scenes

As I take your hand and lead you to the dance floor.
As the music dies...
Something in your eyes,
Calls to mind a silver screen,
And all its sad goodbyes.

[CHORUS:]
I'm never gonna dance again
Guilty feet have done my rhythm.
Though it's easy to pretend,
I know you're not a fool.
I should have known better then to cheat a friend,
And waste a chance that I'd been given.
So I'm never gonna dance again.
The way I danced with you.

Time can never mend
The careless whisper of a good friend.
To the heart and mind
If your answer's kind...
There's no comfort in the truth,
Pain is all you find.

Tonight the music seems so loud,
I wish that we could lose this crowd.
Maybe it's better this way

We could have been so good together
We could have lived forever...
But no, who's gonna dance with me?

Del Amitri,"All day long, sweeping up the dead pigeons from the pavement
After the long dim dawn
He remembered how she pulled him from disaster into laughter.

Well it didn't take long for him to be consumed
And he turned around and said as her caressing resumed
""we once were close but now we're both marooned,
And what was once a stirring melody is now a distant tune.""
She said ""you angel, you flower, you're powerful.""
But he felt no feelings but his head hot and belly full
And basking in the sun he only feels a gas fire
And he sees no apparent difference between the chimney and the church spire
He says: ""this garden of roses, is overgrown with weeds,
And where the great west river flows I can see nothing but pebbles and reeds.""

All day long she stuck his nose into siberia
And dragged him through hong kong
Till she said ""you carrier, you coward, you're pitiful,
Feeling less and less is just an easy way of doing more wrong.""

Cut a path leading through my life
I weave through the gusts of change
As a kite might through the sky.
I feel down and degraded
Like I felt when you and me began to tire
And we stopped long ago
But I thought it was just ceasefire.

I can leave the past behind like any normal man can do
But what I find most of the time
Is that I have been left behind you.
I can feel time pushing me forward
So what does it matter what direction I'm pointed in?
No one else used to sing my sad chorus
Now I feel that they too have joined in.

Bad luck and lucky breaks
Cut paths right through our lives
We follow the blind man's bluff
Like lorrys follow white lines in the night.
And by our nature we are kept alone
No matter haw long your nails
You can't cut out of the womb.
And if I can't crash off-course
You must be marooned
And we will not be able to go back to

You used to stifle a smile or forget not to yawn

And the surrounding stars 
Might change completely in the space of an hour 
But not an eclipse of the sky nor a colliding car 
Will turn me back now that I've come this far
Not a shotgun blast nor a shooting star 
Will bring her back from her stubborn tower
It's a kind of madness, it's a kind of sin

To live in the state of mind I've been living in 
Her face imprinted on my sight 
Her voice resounding in my skull at night
If there is a living goddess on Earth 
It must be her from the heaven highlife 
It takes this girl to realize what you're worth 

And I'm worth nothing it she's worth more than my life
But there's more that me than simple devotion 
I won't just crawl at her feet and utter a plea 
And if she refused I wouldn't walk into the ocean 
Just because my world was left all out at sea
So it was in this cafe when we eventually met 

And I wished I had sunglasses and smoked cigarettes 
The World 
And the surrounding stars 
They change completely in the space of an hour 
When over the table and two cups of tea 
She told me she felt the same way about me

And not an eclipse of the sky nor a colliding car

We jump into the ignorant heaven that is the lovers place",Deceive Yourself (In Ignorant Heaven),1985

Obviously not me.
She's locked up inside herself
And I can't get anything free
So won't somebody tell me please
Why the former owner always keeps the keys.

There's no bubbles to burst
No bursting out crying nor dying of thirst
She's utterly tied to somebody else
And it seems he got there first.
And no, I'm not untying
The reins around her neck that she feels
And I won't try to prise out of her the truth anymore
When she lies about the things that she sees
Because the former owner always keeps the keys.

There's no calling
""come here, you're necessary to me.""
There's no excitement in her face when I implore
""corrupt me and confess to me some more.""
And when we hear trees falling or see people disappearing
Her emotions won't be reached or released,
Because the former owner is keeping the keys

Like a ticket inspector running for a bus
Irony's revenge surrounds us.
And it's ironic that he promised you he'd never let you go
When he's left you used-up and disturbed
And I said ""just as the early bird catches the worm
The early cat catches the bird""

Del Amitri,"I suppose love lives in a dustbin behind the garden wall
You have to grovel on the ground and be pretty disgusting
To find it at all
And I suppose that it grows on you
Standing there with no clothes on,
And I suppose because there's beautiful girls in this town
I'll stay here till I've chosen one.
I suppose life's like a hunt, really: the hounds have fun
Until the fox gets bagged
And not one girl in this town will ever fall in love with me:
They'll get dragged.

Her heart speaks to me; says the room the room the room
Beneath her dress, and I suppose that it beats for me
Like a hammering moon pulling tides through her chest
Suppose she says that she owes me
All that she owns and all that she is
It seems to me I suppose that her heart's not enough
And her love is a swizz.

So suppose love lives in a mansion
How the hell do I get over the wall?
And if my rope's not stretched the right tension
I won't cross this grand canyon at all.
And I suppose that it grows like a tumor, spreads like a rumor
Like the grass grows and inch every day
And I suppose that before I even know it, the tide will start flowing
And the drum beneath my jacket will say:

You know you need her everyday
She is the moon and she showed me her face
She is the house and she opened the gates
",Hammering Heart,1985
Del Amitri,"Like it or not you'll see my face soon
I'll force my way up into your room
The things I say will soon make you swoon
I'll point to the sun and say it's the moon

So you needn't fret, I'll get in your life yet
Make you sit back and enjoy the touch of a boy
Lie over relaxed with your hand on your lap
Just give me some time so I can work on your spine.

I'll turn into jelly by being so kind
I'll love you to death before your first grasp for breath
I'll open your doors and take what I find
Your heart is gold it's just a matter of time

Give me that gold and I'll melt it down
Give me the tears that I took from your eye
You are not getting so far or going back home
Without regretting that I got your backbone
I'll turn you into a lovelump chum

""this is the bad life, what are we here for? ""

Though there was leads in the petrol and bacteria in the beer
Though she moved away and left me hopeless, I was writing
I was here.

She said this bad life that I'm leading is deceiving and depriving me
I said why don't you try relieving me, while she was reading
I was stealing from the library.

And sweetness and sadness lived in sin
With built-in indigestion the new buildings held their stomachs in
Goodness and badness were hardly anything

Though the sweating was getting near
Though her head was hung saying I did not become her, I keep writing

Though you are dying to go

And here is a cup being filled up to be drunk again

To be drunkards and diddymen
Making gulf wars and battered wives.

Just greediness

Where we while away the happy saturdays
Between the television and the telephone
And I stroke your head just to feel what I own

""will you be my property, and not my disability? ""
And why are you craving
To be free from love's slavery
Stop teasing me

I am the concert hall in which you hear me say
I'll act a man in almost anyway I can

You were born wrong
But why am I picking holes in you
When it's holes that we all come from?

To stop love from living too long.

You devastated me and now when you leave the room

You're the fire and flames
I might be half-dead and half-born, girl
But whales start singing when I hear your name

I'm heaped with hate like acid rain
Nothing can restrain the loathing and disgust I have
And there is no one I distrust
More than the happy whores who buy and trade
Crawling on all fours, backwards into holes and fires
That wealth and self-congratulations made

You're the sticks and stones, girl
You're the fire and flames
You're the punishment, the pleasure, the employment and the leisure
You're the sweet conversation and the cutting names

Heart, head, hands and all forms
Went from red-hot blood to bone dry and lukewarm

And moss instead of sugar beet and corn

In a room next door a couple is fighting 
But isn't that just one of love's charms 
When moods change as fast as lightning 
And fifteen minutes later you're 
Lying in each other's arms 

And you're gone 

They say that it's better to have loved and lost 
Than never to have loved at all 
But if you sit down and count the cost of 
All those losses 
There's no profit at all 

This city gets crazy at Christmas 
Glitter guards the crucifix all over the place 
Its head gets too big for its body 
And its mouth gets 
Too big for its face 

And you're gone 

Never throw away an old newspaper 
Everyday's rich with its current accounts 
Prince visits Philippines and parliament debates it 
Back page, column five 
Somebody's wedding's announced 

Sunday night's the night for loving 
And squeezing out the weekend's last drops 
Sunday night's the night for forgiving 
Maybe that's why 
They shut the shops 

And you're gone 

One day you wake up 
And all the pain you've given out gets returned 
But I'm not sorry now 
I've payed for what I've learned 

And you're gone 

I turned on a T.V. station and 
Lip-read with the sound turned down 
It was the Church of Christ playing the Price Is Right 
Where everybody starves 
While Leslie Crowther counts",You're Gone,1989
Del Amitri,"You'd better get some sleep for a change 
Before tomorrow brings you down 
By three o'clock they'll both be sitting on that plane 
Hopelessly honeymoon bound 
And I hope no one asks you to kiss this bride 
Or tie tin cans to the car 
And if friends and relations mingle outside 
You can linger at the bar 

So bring on the rainclouds and block out the moon 
Let the action begin 

You'll feel like some soap opera star 
Predictably hitting the booze 
With your standard issue broken heart 
You step into your Saturday shoes 
And you might feel better if you slapped her face 
Or slipped some pills in his wine 
But instead some voice in your head keeps saying 
You'll look back and laugh sometime 

So bring on the rainclouds and block out the moon 
Let the action begin 

Cause it's as sure as sunrise and as sure as time 
The bride will be changing and you will be crying 
And it will be raining as soon as the tide comes in 

So put on your lipstick and check that you hat's straight too 
Cause if they can go through with it you can do it too 

So bring on the rainclouds and block out the moon 
Let the action begin 

Cause it's as sure as sunrise and as sure as time 
The bride will be changing and you will be crying 
And it will be raining as soon as the tide comes in 
And it will be raining as soon as the tide comes in",As Soon as the Tide Comes In,1992
Del Amitri,"Don't tell her that you want her 
Don't ask her to be yours 
Don't tell her she is everything 

Or she might see the fool behind the frown 
And then the heart behind the fool 

Don't tell her that you need her 
Don't tell her that you care 
Don't ask her to hold you 

Or she might see the fool behind the frown 
And then the heart behind the fool 

Behind the cool, there's a dreading that 
Someday she'll betray you 
Someday she will dispose of 
All her photographs of you 

So don't tell her when you're lonely 
Don't tell her when you're blue 
Don't tell her she means everything to you 

So don't tell her that you need her 
Don't tell her that you care 
Don't ask her to hold you 

Or she might see the fool behind the frown 
And then the heart behind the fool",Behind the Fool,1992
Del Amitri,"You'll get hooked, you'll get drugged 
She'll be your essence she'll be your blood 
And you'll want her so much but you'll never get enough 
And that's the first rule of love 

She'll smell so sweetly in the morning 
She'll make you feel so good inside 
And you'll want her so much you'll give everything else up 
And that's the first rule of love 

You'll grow comfortable together 
You'll start to fit like hand and glove 
And then you'll start to hate the men she used to dream of 
And that's the first rule of love 

You'll miss her madly, when you're apart 
Love is like gravity holding down your heart 

You'll grow envious and bitter 
She'll be enquiring and concerned 
And you'll feel so close to her but never close enough 
To get past the first rule of love 
And with the awkwardness of strangers 
You will finally give up 
No exceptions to the first rule of love",The First Rule of Love,1992
Del Amitri,"Daylight comes with such surprising speed 
Yesterday you talked of love and now you want to leave 
But don't expect me to stand in your way 
I am powerless to alter any action you might take 

And I won't take the blame 
I was not the one who played the joker in this game 
I was not the one who feels nothing anymore 
So if you walk out that door, I won't take the blame 

And as I look at the girl I once adored 
You tell me that I hold you back you tell me that you're bored 
So like a pair of clowns we stand around and fight 
Why can't you get it over with and walk out of my life? 

And I won't take the blame 
I was not the one who played the joker in this game 
I was not the one who feels nothing anymore 
So if you walk out that door, I won't take the blame 

And the steps of this old church are peppered with confetti hearts 
Like a million little love affairs waiting to fall apart",I Won't Take the Blame,1992
Del Amitri,"Go and tell your mother, go and tell your friends 
You've been fooled again 
He appeared like magic and he left you on a late night train 
Yeah, some things never change 

Cause baby the ones that you love lead you nowhere 
Yeah baby the ones that you love lead you nowhere 

If you could just be patient, pretty soon you would forget his name 
And face this world again 
If you could just stop looking for someone special 
You might save yourself some pain 

Cause baby the ones that you love lead you nowhere 
Yeah baby the ones that you love lead you nowhere 

Every little lie makes you look so dumb 
They tell you nobody has ever come as close as you've come 
So baby tonight you've got the right to feel so numb 

Cause baby the ones that you love lead you nowhere 
Cause baby the ones that you love lead you nowhere",The Ones That You Love Lead You Nowhere,1992
Del Amitri,"With the sweet drip of every raindrop 
Time brings you closer to me 
And with each new sign at every train-stop 
Another hour without you is consigned to history 

And with each tick of my alarm clock 
I get crazy for the days to get to you 
When I can hold you and kiss you and have you 
Instead of staring at some photo like a fool 

But as day turns to night there's this hopelessness to fight 
When I think that I might not make it through 

But honey sometimes I just have to say your name 
To hear it hanging in the air, to know it sounds the same 
And sometimes when I'm blue, I know just what to do 
To keep the blues at bay you know I only have to say your name 

So this morning I picked up the paper 
In the useless descent of the rain 
While partners in heartbreak the whole world over 
Lie and cheat just the same 
And the headlines proclaim everything has changed 
Love can't save you now 
As each little motion of my writswatch 
Holds up my faith somehow 

But as day turns to night there's this hopelessness to fight 
When I think that I might not make it through 

But honey sometimes I just have to say your name 
To hear it hanging in the air, to know it sounds the same 
And sometimes when I'm blue, I know just what to do 
To keep the blues at bay you know I only have to say your name 

When I've used up all my patience 
When your letters have been read twenty times through 
I can drink all the wine in this place of mine 
But it ain't no replacement 
It ain't no replacement for you",Sometimes I Just Have to Say Your Name,1992
Del Amitri,"Snow in a soulless city covers up the cracks in the road 
As a wastrel buys her cigarettes and wipes her pretty nose 
Like a part-time Elvis imitator these streets I knew so well 
Have been pasted beyond recognition with a temporary smell 

Now the midnight train eases out leaving everyone marooned 
And without her it might as well be the surface of the moon 

From the well-swept streets of Jackson Heights to the dockside drudgery 
Everything's now a replica of what it used to be 
And since they tarted up the trenches and painted the bridges blue 
It seems less like a home to me than just a place they bury you 

Now we're lit up like a cathedral in our frozen concrete ruin 
And without her it might as well be the surface of the moon 

So I need her and I love her that is true 
But I'm stuck here like some shipwreck still holding on to you 
So when they beat out the tramps and patch up the slums 
Everything will be fine 
There'll be a new facade for us to hide behind 

So on the ancient trails of our coupling in the places we used to meet 
I am amazed by the lack of memories that I thought would flood through me 
And the riverside where we first kissed has now been reduced 
To a phony old world market where only shoppers get seduced 

Now your arms embrace me strangely in your unfamiliar room 
And for all I care it might as well be the surface of the moon 
Yeah for all I care it might as well be the surface of the moon",Surface of the Moon,1992
Del Amitri,"Roll down the window, let me hear the rain 
Let me hear her whispering, honey everything is OK 

Cause I've had enough bad news 
To last a lifetime 

Well I drove all night under a seasick sky 
And I made it by mid-afternoon 
And I hope she's home so she can hold me tight and tell me 
Everything is alright 

Cause I've had enough bad news 
To last a lifetime 

And I was struck by how much I remembered 
And how everything still looked the same 
When a neighbor I met in her hallway said 
""Looks like lover boy's too late again"" 

So take your troublesome baggage 
And put it on the last train home 
Cause you can guess somewhere else in the world right now 
Someone else feels just as alone 

Cause I've had enough bad news 
To last a lifetime",To Last a Lifetime,1992
Del Amitri,"The bus is pulling out and I guess I'd better go
Before I make a grave mistake and let my feelings show
And twenty miles away she waits alone for me
But when I try to picture her you're the one I see
And in another situation I could put up a fight
But you will be my downfall tonight

So the night is coming down, drowning us in blue
And it all points towards the things we know we shouldn't do
And as I look at you and I fall under your spell
Well I know I should be thinking of her lying there herself

And when faced with temptation you know a man should stand and fight
But you will be my downfall tonight

Be my downfall be my great regret be the one girl
That I'll never forget
Be my undoing be my slow road to ruin tonight

So the bus is pulling out and I'm grounded here with you
And I want to say the sweet things babe I've always wanted to
So tell me now the tail-lights have gone out of sight
Baby won't you be my downfall once again tonight",Be My Downfall,1993
Del Amitri,"There is a girl I used to know
She had a hundred ways of hurting you, and so
I packed my bags and left her as she watched some TV show,
There is a girl I used to know.

There is a town I used to love
It once contained most everything I ever dared dream of.
My baby in the basement as the traffic trolled above,
There is a town I used to love.

There is a bar I used to know
I still sometimes drop by when I have no place else to go.
It's where the kings of comedy compare their tattered souls,
There is a bar I used to know.

So buy me one more drink before you go,
Or lend me a twenty and I'll get drunk on my own.
You always find some company come in to use the phone,
Someone who can't stand to see a friend go home alone.

There is a joke I used to tell
Some guy who gets three wishes, ends up wasting them to hell.
And in the end, in misery, he tells the joke himself:

There is a guy I used to know
He once had everything that any man could hope.
And now he sits here drinking with a tale that always goes:
""There is a girl I used to know..""",Whiskey Remorse,1993
Del Amitri,"Oh Cindy ain't you noticed 
That several of your friends have moved on
And the street outside is just a little too quiet
And your local papers run out of news
I'm not persuading you or disengaging you
But Cindy you and me we got to move

Can you refuse, no time to lose
We'll hit the high road early this morning
So don't be late, don't hesitate

Can you refuse, with no time to lose
We'll hit the high road early this morning

Del Amitri,"I still don't believe it, how much we lied 
Last night you made it with him now I'm supposed to be dignified 
Just like a man 

Well I spend my night times drinking and you spend your days in bed 
And I guess it's up to us to choose the methods by which we forget 

And just like a man he holds you gently 
And just like a man he strokes your hair 
And just like a man I still pretend that I'm 
Immune to the whole affair 

But I wanna die, I wanna cry, I wanna tell you I was wrong 
Yeh I wanna die, I wanna cry but it's too late 
So I soldier on just like a man 

I don't believe it, you were easy to leave but now 
I do my best to relieve it the only way I know how

Del Amitri,"It seems like weeks since you looked at me baby
Without that look of distaste
I don't know why your feelings are changing
But I've seen it in your face
All those times when our lips were kissing
Our tongues were telling lies
And all those signs that I've been missing
Were right there in your eyes.

So come on babe, let's kiss this thing goodbye.

I sometimes feel when we're together baby,
Everything has turned out wrong
And I know you feel exactly the same way

The cops got called and told us to behave
But I don't mind if nothing went to waste

And from childish misbehaving comes the games that adults play
 
And I could not recall what made me feel like that

By the time you get through college, by the time you learn to drive
I'll be picking thought the garbage of my life

By the time you get adjusted to your objectionable role
I'll be deleted, deselected from that very long street you know
When you've lost your sense of direction and burned every happiness you know

When you were young 

The disappointment of success 
Hangs from your shoulders like a hand-me down dress 
And down nostalgia's rocky road 
You watch your former lovers growing old 

So look into the mirror do you recognize someone

In party town, when loneliness comes crashing down.

And you'll be hurting in a way you can't explain,
And all those pretty things you love will look so vain.

Tell her the chips are down

Is there something wrong
And you can't put your finger on it?

A soul so in despair
So if you want to talk the night through
Guess who will be there?

You just got used and when you're used you're thrown away
Look at me now, look at the lines upon my face
And look at my crowd, haven't we all lived like it's a race?

And there are times I sense the trails of pain I leave
When over the road there hangs
Those springtime lynching trees

Just look around, everyone's acting the same way
In a playground town where we can all live like it's a race
Where we can all live for we can take
But haven't we all lived life by mistake?

And haven't we all chased time
Like a paper cup down the street and up the stairs?
And haven't we all found the door is shut
And the keys are everywhere, in this life by mistake?

And there are moments when the heavens open wide
When you can hold your dreams and see your future bright
Look at me now, haven't I tried to do what's right?

The way I know how, I have acquired my life like a taste
And I have tried to live the right way
But I have lived my life by mistake

And the city it shines in surprise in the ice cream heat
And I want to be kissed in the haze of this hotel room
Before the evening steals the afternoon

And the traffic it shakes as my travel shaver drones
And the maid she mistakes my 'come in' for a 'please leave me alone'
But I want to be held in the swell of her sweet perfume

Before the daylight dies and the dusty sky gets rusted up with tungsten
Before the phony night stakes its claim on walkers waiting at the junction

Made a killing on copper mine

Got a taste for fancy wine

Were paper thin

He built a big white house
In the valley of the kings
Took a beautiful wife
Bought her every possible thing
And the silk she wore 
Was paper thin

Well they traveled in style
Paid cash for everything
Had a beautiful child
Had a champagne christening
But as they raised their glasses in toast to him
He saw the crystal was paper thin

So shadows came
Whispering words to him
Sold the company out
And cashed all those futures in
But it all still looked so
Paper thin

Well it was late one night
And the rain was streamin' down
He called his wife's name out
And said honey it's over now
I'm gonna burn it all
I can't take this anymore

There was a shop called B.J.'s that she stepped into to get out of the gale
They sold only British manufactured, lifetime guaranteed to fail

It says, 'I'll get back to you unless first your girlfriend slits your throat.'""

And the dreams that you dream of
Once in a lullaby

Somewhere over the rainbow
Bluebirds fly
And the dreams that you dream of
Dreams really do come true

Someday, I wish upon a star
Wake up where the clouds are far behind me
Where trouble melts like lemon drops
High above the chimney top
That's where you'll find me

Somewhere over the rainbow
Bluebirds fly
And the dreams that you dare to
Oh why, oh why can't I?

Well, I see trees of green and red roses too
I'll watch them bloom for me and you
And I think to myself
What a wonderful world

Well, I see skies of blue and I see clouds of white
And the brightness of day
I like the dark
And I think to myself what a wonderful world

The colors of the rainbow so pretty in the sky
And also on the faces of people passing by
I see friends shaking hands saying
How do you do?
They're really saying I, I love you

I hear babies cry and I watch them grow
They'll learn much more then we'll know
And I think to myself what a wonderful world

Someday I wish upon a star

I Wonder Where You Are Tonight

 
  
Tonight I'm sad my heart is weary
Wondering if I'm wrong or right
To think about you though you left me
I wonder where you are tonight

   The rain is cold and slowly falling
   Upon my window pane tonight
   And though your love seems even colder
   I wonder where you are tonight

Your heart was cold you never loved me
Though you often said you cared
And now you've gone to find another
Someone who knows the love I shared

Then came the dawn the day you left me
I tried to smile with all my might
But you could see the pain within me
That lingers in my heart tonight

 
 
",I Wonder Where You Are Tonight,1968
Del McCoury,"You've gone so far away, my darling
Each time I think of you I cry
I press your picture to my bosom
Then I feel that you're close by

Years have passed you've not returned dear
Now they say that you have died
But your soul will live forever
Now I know you'll be close by

I saw you last while you were leaving
The tears from you I tried to hide
You took me in your arms and said dear
Your memory I keep close by

They buried you in a lonely graveyard
And a spot they left beside
There I'll sleep 'till Jesus calls us
So that we can be close by",Close By,1988
Del McCoury,"Nestling in the pine trees in the mountains
Down along the road I love it still
There I know my dear old mother's waiting
Waiting and I know she always will

Chorus
Home is where the heart is they tell me
Many, many try to travel that lonesome road
They'll never find a pal as true as mother
They'll never find a place as sweet as home

Now many years ago I left my old home
Started out out to ramble all around
If ever I return to where I came from
I'll build a little home and settle down

Our home was silent and so sad
Dad took sick and had to leave us

   There's a little lonesome grave yard
   On these tomestones it did say
   On mother's ""gone but not forgotten""
    On dad's ""we'll meet again someday""

I often go out to the graveyard
Where they laided them down to rest
I can almost hear them whisper
Trust in god He'll do the rest

Their souls have gone up to heaven
Where they'll dwell with god above
Where they'll meet there friends and loved ones
And share with all his precious love",Memories of Mother and Dad,1988

 Thinking about the days that used to be. 
      
 High on a mountain oh, standin' all alone 

 Wondering where the years of my life has flown. 


 Oh I wonder if you ever think of me 
 or if time has blotted out your memory. 
 As I listen to the breeze, whisper gently through the trees 
 I'll always cherish what you meant to me. 

",High on a Mountain,1992
Del McCoury,"Old memories mean nothing to me
They've all gone away from me now
I'm alone in the night it's plain to see
And old memories mean nothing to me

It's the day that I'm thinkin' of
I've forgotten yesterday's love
So if you don't love me now set me free
For old memories mean nothing to me

Time has a way of passing by
Over the ruts of our lives it will fly
And if you don't love me now I can see
And old memories mean nothing to me

I know we once had a fine love
Over others you towered above
But I'm not the playful kind you can see
And old memories mean nothing to me

Now I've got nothing left to lose

And I reached to hold my dream of yesterday

The blues have such an early hour

My will now stripped of all its power

No future left for me to do

I'm cheek to cheek with the blues

Her cheeks were warm and so exciting

Last night I thought of love so true

Today I'm cheek to cheek with the blues

 

Her lipstick still warm on the cup

She must have left just as I woke up

Yeah the blues have such an early hour

And a love that went wrong from the start

How Bobby he loved Mary and she thought she loved him

But she found she had a cold cheater's heart

 

And that life out on the farm ain't what she had in mind

When she promised to honor and obey

So she took to runnin' round all over town

Ain't it funny how life turns out that way

 

The years have tumbled by Bobby turned an ol' blind eye

To the things he hoped just weren't true

And then came that fateful day when he had been away

Oh they say he came home just too soon

 

He found them lyin' there oh it was more than he could bear

He found a gun she cried don't be rash

But two shots filled the air he stood right there and stared

The deed was done it was over in a flash

 

That old judge looked down and sighed he said Bobby you'll have to die

The law is clear and it must take its toll

Think on the deed you've done your race on earth is run

And may God have mercy on your soul

 

On a cold November morn in a prison so forlorn

The warden prayed as did the parson too

And the crowd gathered there they heard him loud and clear

The man standing by her side shows her off with such eager pride

Seems since I saw her last she's done all right

 

She could never place me in her mind for me the years have not been kind

From her station and her place she'd never recognize my face

Del McCoury,"We're seeking information
About a man who's living here
His name is Henry Walker
Now don't you fret and fear
His crime is cold blood murder
He's wanted by the law
We'll take him back to face his crime
It's the worst you ever saw
 
Well we know Henry Walker
He lives way back in the woods
Where he hunts and traps and fishes
And his living ain't too good
But if you aim to catch him
You better learn his hunting ground
He'll hide just like an old white hare
And you know he can't be found
 
CHORUS:
Yes the cold was splitting timber
With a crack like a 44
And the wind was whistling through the lonesome pines
It bit right through my parka
And froze me to the core
As the wolves were howling on the timberline
 
We reached ol' Henry's cabin
By noon of second day
He must have heard us coming
For he up and he ran away
We camped by the rocky rapids
While the moon was shining bright
We heard ol' Henry laughing
Way out in the night
 
We tracked him for a week or more
Through the swamp and through the hills
Till a rifle roared I cried ""My God
My partner has been killed""
I propped him by an ol' jack pine
And swore a solemn vow
""Lookout Henry Walker
It's you and me right now""
 
So then I started thinking
He could not be found
Then one day by a frozen lake
Like a fox he went to ground
And he tried to run
But the ice was thin
And he fell on through
I watched him as he sank and swore
""I'll put a curse on you""
 
I dragged my frozen partner
Through the ice and through the snow
I lost three fingers and a toe
To the frostbite don't you know
Though the years have come, the years have gone
I think about those times
When Northern lights are dancing
It makes me feel like crying

Del McCoury,"There's more pretty girls than one
More pretty girls then one
Every old town that I rambled around
And there's more pretty girls than one

Mama talked to me last night
She gave me some good advise
She said ""Son, you'd better quit this old ramblin' all around
And mary you a sweet little wife""

Honey, look down that old lonesome road
Hang down your pretty head and cry
'cause I'm thinking all about them pretty little gals
And a-hopin' that I never die

Every old town that I rambled around
And there's more pretty girls than one

Del McCoury,"The first time I saw Carrie Brown 
She was so young and fair 
A voice like spring rain fallin' down and sunlight in her hair 
I'd never seen her face before so I asked all around 
Her daddy owns a grocery store and she lives in Bristol town 

Carrie darlin' Carrie Carrie Brown I cry 
If I can't marry Carrie Brown, believe I'd rather die 

I laid my last ten dollars down 
Though I didn't need a thing 
Just to touch sweet Carrie Brown 

When she handed me my change 
I hung around 'til closin' time I scarce believed my eyes 
My darlin' walkin' arm in arm 
With a boy named Billy Wise 

I walked around in Bristol town a bitter broken man 
A heart that pined for Carrie Brown and a pistol in my hand 
We met again on State Street poor Billy Wise and me 
I shot him in Virginia and he died in Tennessee 

Now I'm down in the Bristol jail and all I do is cry 
Cause the jury found me guilty and the judge says I must die 
I'm just a poor young mountain boy 
Ain't never been to town 
And I've come to ruination for the love of Carrie Brown",Carrie Brown,1999
Del McCoury,"I am Kilrain and I'm a fightin' man
And I come from County Clare
And the brits would hang me for a fenian 
So I took me leave of there

And I crossed the ocean in the ""Arrianne""
The vilest tub afloat
And the captain's brother was a railroad man and he met us at the boat
So I joined up with the 20th Maine
Like I said my friend I'm a fighting man
And we're marchin' south in the pouring rain
And we're all goin' down to dixieland

I am Kilrain of the 20th Maine
And we fight for Chamberlain
'Cause he stood right with us 
When the johnnies came like a banshee on the wind
When the smoke cleared out of Gettysburg many a mother wept
For many a good boy died there, sure
And the air smelted just like death

[Chorus]
I am Kilrain of the 20th Maine 
And I'd march to hell and back again
For colonel Joshua Chamberlain
We're all goin' down to dixieland

I am Kilrain of the 20th Maine
And I damn all gentlemen
Whose only worth is their father's name
And the sweat of a workin' man
Well we come from the farms 
And the city streets and a hundred foreign lands
And we spilled our blood in the battle's heat
Now we're all Americans

And the moon is gone 
That's when I come around

I've done everything I know 
To get you off my mind 
But sometimes I can't help but hope 
That you won't walk away this time 

Then I wouldn't have to watch you go 
Wouldn't have to miss you so

Would have lived in Oklahoma all his days 
He just wanted left alone to work a piece of land 
But a hard wind come and blew his dreams away 
So he headed for the West Coast thought he could not lose 
Rollin' down the highway with the dust bowl blues 

It's a thousand miles from Broken Bow to Bakersfield 
And the highway's paved with heartaches all the way 
Leroy drove on lookin' for a better deal 
A place a man could settle down and stay 
But the police at the state line beat him black and blue 
Left him lyin' by the roadside with the dust bowl blues 

They say California is a paradise

But I can't lose these lonesome highway blues 
Down that long, lonesome highway just as far as I can go 
Til I outrun your memory 

Bound down that long, lonesome highway just as fast as I can fly 
Just want to go to someplace you won't be

Del McCoury,"I was born on this mountain a long time ago
Before they knocked down the timber and strip-mined the coal
When you rose in the mornin' before it was light
To go down in that dark hole and come back up at night

I was born on this mountain, this mountain's my home
She holds me and keeps me from worry and woe
Well, they took everything that she gave, now they're gone
But i'll die on this mountain, this mountain's my home

I was young on this mountain but now i am old
And i knew every holler, every cool swimmin' hole
'til one night i lay down and woke up to find
That my childhood was over and i went down in the mine

There's a hole in this mountain and it's dark and it's deep
And god only knows all the secrets it keeps
There's a chill in the air only miners can feel
There're ghosts in the tunnels that the company sealed",The Mountain,1999

Del McCoury,"My Grandaddy was a railroad man 
When I was young he took me by the hand 
Dragged me to the station at the break of dawn 
Said ""boy I got to show you somethin' 'fore it's gone"" 
She was blue and silver, she was right on time 
We rode that Texas Eagle on the Mopac line 

We had some sandwiches that Granma packed 
We rode to Palestine and hitchhiked back 
Home in time for supper with a tale to tell 
That night I dreamed I heard that lonesome whistle wail 

When I got old enough to take the train alone 
I rode that Texas Eagle down to San Antone 

Nowadays they don't make no trains 
Just the piggyback freighters and them Amtrak things 
They shut the Eagle down awhile ago 
Sold it to the railroad down in Mexico 
But every now and then that whistle's on my mind 
I ride that Texas Eagle cross the borderline",Texas Eagle,1999

A thing that makes you lose your mind?
Every time I start to think about her
Sends shivers up and down my spine

My daddy was a bit of a rounder
Said these women are gonna make you go blind
I told my old man that I'm right over here
Like the way I see just fine

I'm the son of a ramblin' man
Son of a runnin' kind
I'm the son of a ramblin' man
I come from a long, long line

Well, I'm just a hillbilly gypsy
I ain't much for settling down
If I thought somebody might miss me
Maybe I'd hang around

So I better keep on drifting
As every town just a little too small
Ain't nothin' in the world like a woman
I'm going to try to love them all

I'm the son of a ramblin' man

A girl could feel special on any such like""
Said James to Red Molly, ""My hat's off to you
It's a Vincent Black Lightning 1952""

""And I've seen you at the corners and cafes it seems
Red hair and black leather, my favorite color scheme""
And he pulled her on behind
And down to Knoxville they did ride

Said James to Red Molly, ""Here's a ring for your right hand
But I'll tell you in earnest, I'm a dangerous man
I've fought with the law since I was seventeen
I robbed many a man to get my Vincent machine""

""Now I'm twenty one years, I might make twenty two
And I don't mind dying but for the love of you
And if fate should break my stride
Then I'll give you my Vincent to ride""

""Come down, come down, Red Molly"", called Sergeant McRae
""For they've taken young James Adie for armed robbery
Shotgun blast hit his chest, left nothing inside
Come down, Red Molly to his dying bedside""

When she came to the hospital, there wasn't much left
He was running out of road, he was running out of breath
But he smiled to see her cry
Said, ""I'll give you my Vincent to ride""

Said James, ""In my opinion, there's nothing in this world
Beats a 52 Vincent and a red headed girl
Now Norton's and Indians and Greeves just won't do
Ah, they don't have a soul like a Vincent 52""

He reached for her hand and he slipped her the keys
Said he don't have any further use for these
I see angels on Ariel's in leather and chrome
Swooping down from heaven to carry me home

And he gave her one last kiss and died
And he gave her his Vincent to ride

I've known so long, with me you've been unsatisfied
So I finally found the strength to say goodbye
Why already I forgot a million memories
And leaving you was easy as could be

But I might as well be talking to the wall
When I tell myself I'm not missing you at all
Cause every time you come around, I fall
And I might as well be talking to the wall

And the look we gave each other said we both need a friend
Is this the first time you've come here all the nights you've been alone
Searching for something that just isn't at home

How long has it been when's the last time he kissed you
My you sure look lovely in that dress so tight and thin
There's a look in your eye that cries somebody love me
And I wonder how long has it been

I sat down at your table we shared a drink or two
All the things that first look told me now I find are really true
Someone's neglect has left an emptiness where love used to be
Then you reached out and touched my hand softly whispered to me

Ha, ha, ha, it's not so funny
Let's all sing together, it's got to be pretty, let's go

Listen to my song, well, listen to my song
(Tell me if you'd like it play, I'll change it if it's wrong
Listen to my music, George, see if it's alright
If it's not what you've had in mind, I'll write you one tonight)

Well, I wrote a little song a few months ago
My friends all said that thing oughta go
So I packed my bags and I hit for Nashville town
Well, I wanted to get me a big star to do it
So I made me a list with a few names through it
And I started out to see if Eddy Arnold was in town

Well, I come in a home way back in the den
I can tell he was glad when I walked in
Cause he broken the singin', 'Make The World Go Away'
He finally listen the part of my song
And then with a drawl of two, two miles long
He said see Ernest Tubb, ha, ha, he lives just across the way

Listen to my song

Well, I'd see ol' Ern, he was walking the floor
Cause just as records were sellin' lower
But he put me on a take and listened to every word
He said, I've been singin' since I was a kid
And nothin' sounds like that song did

Ah, throw him out Billy Byrd
Well, I quit myself, got back on my feet
I saw Johnny Cash up in down the street
And I asked him if he can use a hit or two
He said, I made mon' on a Ring Of Fire

Size Luther King, playin' on his guitar
So I don't care of the doo-di-dude-di
I called Bill Anderson and he was at home
But he said my mama sang a song
I'm sorry but I hope that you understand

I saw Ralph Emery and I talked to him
Along ol' Tex Ritter and WSM
But they was too busy shakin' one another's hands
Folly I decided that the only way
A stranger in Nashville can make a little hay
Is just to turn a record himself with that Nashville sound

So I borrowed me some money and that's what I did
Everybody tells me, I've got a hit
At least it's bubblin' under about one hundred, ha, ha

Sinatra had the nation's No 1 tune
The Yanks led the American Leauge by a country mile
And I walked the floor as you gave birth to our first child

And when I thanked you for our first son
You just smiled and said the best is yet to come

I don't guess I've ever seen you cry
You saved money until my salvary wouldn't get us by
And it wasn't very long just a couple of years it seemed
We saved enough money and paid down on a five-room dream

And when I thanked you for all you had done
You just smiled and said honey the best is yet to come

Well just think Tony's away to school honey studying law
And do you remember Carrie we voted Queen of the prom that fall
Oh Lord we worked all winter long with Troy and in your mind there's no doubt
Who was the proudest one who was the proudest when he became an Eagle Scout

And when I thanked you for all you had done
You just smiled and said the best is yet to come

The calendar reads the first day of June
The paper says man has walked on the Moon
Now we're sitting here just waitin' alone
And we realize our lives are almost gone

So when we thanked our Lord for all he had done
He just said children the best the best is yet to come

Del Reeves,"It looks everywhere I go always get myself in trouble
Cause the girls I pick on ain't the saintest kind
And I wind up running barefoot to hell and think of clover
Cause the neck I value most of all is mine

That's why I left the blue shirt hanging on the bed post in Seattle
My Levi's float on San Francisco Bay
And I left the Stetson hanging in the hallway down in Dallas
And a dozen pair of boots along the way

Now Betty was a sweet thing I was courting in Seattle
She swore to me she was nobody's wife
But how was I to know she had a boyfriend big as Dallas
And I bid that one good shirt for one good life

That's why I left the blue shirt hanging...
[ fiddle ]
Now Susie had a big yacht we anchored in the harbor
She said she was alone at least today
When he climbed aboard I swam for shore praying I could get there
Lost the Levi's while I made my get-a-way

There were few at the scene but they all agreed
That the slayer who ran looked a lot like me

The judge said, son, what is your alibi?
If you were somewhere else then you won't have to die
I spoke not a word though it meant my life
For I had been in the arms of my best friend's wife

She walks these hills in a long black veil
She visits my grave when the night winds wail

Five, six, seven flight, about eight flight more
On the twelfth I started to drag
By the fifteenth floor I'm ready to sag

Del Suggs,"Old Blue Ford
Music & Lyrics by Delma Carl Suggs

The paint is faded
On this old mottled skin,
With bubbles of rust
Pushing up from within.
The hood is dented
And the windshield is cracked--
A shining example
Of the maintenance lacked.

Chorus:

      Forty years ago,
      It was brand spanking new,
      Forty years ago,
      Man, it sparkled like the dew.
      And it isn't a Cadillac,
      Not a Packard, Not a Cord--
      It's had a pretty good life
      As an old blue Ford

The original engine
Still runs like a colt--
Although it's lost some compression,
And it's seized a few bolts.
The upholstery is raged,
A bit worn and in need--
It was sure built for comfort
And occasional speed.

Chorus

Bridge:

      They worked around the clock
      Back in 1954--
      And after this model
      They didn't make any more.
      It's the final edition
      From a company team
      Carving out a piece of
      The American Dream

You can tune the engine
You can change the oil,
Tighten up the suspension,
Replace the shocks and coil.
But the chassis is solid,
And the drive train is strong--
Keep it out on the highway
And you will never go wrong.",Old Blue Ford,1996
Del Suggs,"Every sun burns a hole in the sky
Until the light drains out
Leaving only stars behind.
In that night when the shadows are gone
I can feel your love
Even when I am alone

And if you ask how I knew
It was real, it was true--
I see it in the sky, I hear it in the wind,
I feel it in my heart, I taste it on your skin--
That?s how I knew.

Fickle love is no stranger to me,
Knocking on my heart
But when I open up she leaves.
Now I know a love that will not be denied
I can just let go
With all doubt cast aside.

And if you ask how I knew
It was real, it was true--
I see it in the sky, I hear it in the wind,
I feel it in my heart, I taste it on your skin,
I see it in your eyes, I hear it in your song
I can truly say: I feel like I belong--
That?s how I knew.",That's How I Knew,2002
Del Suggs,"Out on the road there's a man in a truck
Praying it doesn't snow.
He's miles from his home on a 10-day run,
Still got a long way to go.
He pulls off the highway to top off his tank
And stands pumping gas in the cold.
When he pulls out his wallet and looks at the bills
It warms him right down to his soul.

Chorus:	Caribbean Money, Souvenir bills from a cruise
	Caribbean Money, Clears up his seasonal blues
	When his work starts to get in the way of his fun,
	This currency causes a phenomenon.
	Caribbean Money, Carries him back to the sun.

There's  a worn dollar bill he picked up in Belize
At a bar on Ambergris Cay,
Change from a meal of ceviche and beer,
So good that he still can't believe.
A fin from Barbados, a stain on the edge,
Spilled from his last rum and coke.
That Bridgetown cafe where he ate flying fish
He thought it was some kind of a joke

Chorus

Bridge:	Everybody has a place in their heart
	Where life is simple and free
	A place they can go get away from it all
	That's where we all want to be.

The rain on his wipers is turning to snow,
The roads will be icing up soon.
But he's in the tropics, at least in his head--
His body could be on the moon.
The greenbacks he's holding are keeping him warm
A smile spreads all over his face.
The memories stoking the flames in his heart--
He's going back there some day.",Caribbean Money,2008

You really make me sick with ya fraudulent behavior
You're gonna make me flip and then an army couldn't save ya
Why don't you behave ya little rugrat?
Take a little tip from the tabloid, because I know I'm not paranoid
When I say I saw ya tryin' to mock me
Now you and your crew are on a mission tryin' to hawk me
But it isn't happenin' ya fraudulent foes
You used to front big time now I suppose
That everything's cool since the style of apparel you adopted
You used to make fun of but now you wanna rock it
So you gotta kick it with the homies
But D-E-L is already hip to your cronies

Friends can be fraudulent, just you wait and see
First he was my moneygrip then he stole my honeydip
Mista Dobalina is a serpent, don't you agree?
The little two-tima resembles Aunt Jemima
With jeans and a dirty white hoodie
Seems like he wouldn't be a snake or would he?
Disguises come in all sizes and shapes
Notice the facade of the snakes
They all catch the vapes, even though last year they was GQ
Took a lot of time before the D-E-L could see through
The mask, all I had to do was ask Hemperor and Kwamé
And my man responded they would bomb a
Fraudulent foe with the strength of Hercules
The way ya on my dick must really hurt ya knees
You need to take heed and quit being such a groupie
Ever since I did a little show in Guadeloupee
I neva saw a groupie like you
But what is funny is ya wanted to be down with my crew
But D-E-L is not down with any clowns or jesters
So I would suggest that you try to impress Uncle Fester, Dobalina
Because ya don't impress me Dobalina

With the new batch of catchy little quirks
And it works like a charm as I bomb and alarm any listeners

Del the Funky Homosapien,"I'm chocolate like a bar but my name is not Roseanne
My skin has a pigment, reminiscent of a tan
I plan to grow dreads but first a nappy fro
The longer the hair, the easier to scare a foe
It grows from my head until it covers up my face
People look and stare when I walk into the place
This is just a taste from the Funky Human Being
Ain't no misbehavin', ain't no use for ravin'
Surrounded by the people who would stab me in the back
My skin is really brown even though it's labeled black
Sometimes I wear a cap, and sometimes I wear bandanas
Forbidden in L.A. but I wore one in Atlanta
I chiseled up a sculpture to complement my culture
Thoughts of silly Nubians is prone to give me ulcers
Hangin' with the brothers who are tribal in their ways
For this is how I like to spend my days, and it pays
To steal a groovy sample form the archives
Use my mental staff to eliminate apartheid
Still gather papes like my man Malcom Forbes
Ponderin' my life as I look into my orbs

""Ahonetwo, ahonetwo, I like it""

I love the shade of green like my brother Billy Bixby
I utilize a sample that I salvaged from the 60's cause I'm picky
My meal must appeal to me like Morris
Far too many fraudulent opponents in the forest
I fall into the Gap when I need to purchase clothes
Easy on the fads cause the posers always pose
I suppose they will bite, they'll try not to show it
I came very plain and then feelin' rather loaded
I ditched all the beads cause my needs seem to differ
Me and CM-P are like the Gil and the Skipper
He will use his clippers to give himself a fade
I give my fro a sheen with a smidgen of Pomade
I laid in the shade and I greeted mixel place
With a rhythm and a rhyme and he said that it's a twist
From the ordinary everyday continual assumption that RnB and rap makes a winner
Guess who's comin' through for dinner
A native-like brother with the passive little style
That most certainly will smother
Suicidal rhymes with apocalyptic tunes
I will drink a seltzer while you dabble with the booze
And giggle when I see ya liver shrivel to a prune
I'm the Funky Human Being not a monkey or a coon

Light skin girls ain't satisfied unless they get their way, always
Plus they act stuck up
They all add up to one great big fuck up
They try to play suck up when they want somethin'
Then always leave a brother with nothin'
Ya think ya look better cause ya skin's a little bit lighter?
You're thinkin' you're my type like I was a typewriter?
No, ya think ya all of that and all of this
But you ain't really shit without a makeup kit
See, ya might be light but ya ugly to me
Black is beautiful, to me, that's beauty

Dark skin girls are better than light skin
Light skin girls ain't better than dark skin

Dark skin girls are better than light skin

Now, lets get to the problems
And see if there's a way to solve them
Problem #1, has got to be the attitude
Which is usually vain, selfish and rude
Personality, with her nose stuck up
So don't try talkin' to her or walkin' with her
To class cause it's out of the question
Cause you bein' dark is the wrong complexion
For her she wish she was light, though
I mean lighter than light, or as close to white as possible
But I fight to stay a brother
You see, green and dark skin sisters are the color
This don't apply to all the girls with light skin
Just the ones with their heads up their rear end
Cause if it did, static would occur
Dark skin cuties is what I prefer
Now, look at her, her vision is a blur
Cause contact lenses only let ya see Benzes
Plus she would fuss and cuss if I tried to talk to her
Cause I'm a man who rides the bus
I get frustrated, well, lets say I used to
Now a dark and lovely is who I give juice to
So come on, step to Del if ya with this
This is the facts, so brothers don't forget this

I can't understand you light skin wenches
Ya think ya all that cause ya have long extensions?
Your hair was natural now ya got played out braids
You woulda looked better with a fade
Dark skin girls are so fly, so honest, so sweet
That's the type of girl I wanna meet
Complete, not phony or a fake like you are
See, Del is bolder, I tap you on the shoulder
And say, ""Hey lighty, could you tap that sister for me?""
But you love Mr. Loveable so you'll just ignore me
So find another tip that you can hop upon
To get with me ya need some sun and some Coppertone
You'll take a white boyfriend before a black one
That's why Del has to stand and attack one
Next time you see a girl darker than you
No disrespect when you met her, cause the girl looked better than you

Cause I get paid well, kickin' much tail
Drink me a forty as I ride my rhinoceros
You don't like it? Well you gots to kiss
Where the sun don't shine, something like my behind
I lose a fan but I'mma be fine
Dr. Feelgood, didn't think I still could
Make funk real good
Take it then I looped it
Make you say - Gloryhallastoopid
The Motorbooty make you shake your rump
To the brand new D-Funk
Take a chunk cause I'm much like a hunk
To the dark skinned girls with funk in they trunk
Coming from around the way
It's Del better known as Dr. Bombay

Dr. Bombay
Could you find time and could you stay
Cause the funk is guaranteed to make my day
(It's, so, funky)

Large as a black woman's gluteus maximus
And the question everybody's asking us
""Where'd you get your funk from""
A brother named George and some 151's
So Let's Take It To the Stage you suckers
I jam, and Mistadobalina eats Smuckers
Back in the house with the crew Hieroglyphics
Now you know everything is terrific
Funk in the 1990's that's ironic
So grab you a sack of that chronic
Down with Da Lench Mob straight from the ghetto
But I'm under the sun in the meadow
Me and this Amazon sittin' on my lap
Butt so big when she walk it clap
Doin' the hoochie coochie in the forest
Y'all know who I am so girls sing the chorus

Watch your wife, cause if your spouse calls
Del's gonna damn sure make a house call (hello?)
You peeped out my drawers on your fence
I'm a dog, so you might see paw prints (woof)
(Whattup Doc?) Wait, it ain't cool to jock
Cause you're real far from a ballerina
So oh oh, Mistadobalina
Freeze, and get up off your knees
Everything that Dr. Bombay say
Is guaranteed to make your day
So ""oops"" upside your head
I like Club Med hangin' out with the dreads
And girl if you ain't got a germ
I won't hesitate to pull out my Funky Worm
But if you ain't down with Delvon
Cancel your appointment and please get the hell on (see-ya)
Cause I won't have fraudulent foes
Under my nose, if you won't eighty-six the clothes
Get out the way, so I can save the day
Cause I'm Dr. Bombay

He don't stop and he don't play
Every time I try to catch him he's always running away

Hoodz come in dozens, the magic word is (stick em)
When they spot you and they got you and you can't deal with em

Otherwise you'll catch one between the eyes (bang)

But, nowadays ya gotta have the status
But, natives ain't goin' for the madness
Hey, they're barely outta their teens

I warned 'em

I don't fidget
With the ballet
Fuck a dancer because that's what my pals say
And brothers don't shake ya rumps
Wearin' biker shorts is like chokin' on ya nuts
Because ya might end up with a cramp or a hernia
And that's much worse, than a fine girl burnin' ya

Blasted all out like a feline

I'm not Joe Clark and I would hate for him to lean on
My shoulder and try to hold a conversation
Cause I don't have the patience
When oh when is the bus gonna reach its destination
Question over space and time, wastin' time
Word up, I can't take this line of nitwits
I'm about to have a fit quick
Cause this trip here is making me car sick
Check out the brother with the loaded .38
Braggin' to his buddies about the money that he makes
Sellin' crack viles like pancakes
To baseheads just like the one
That's sittin by the window starvin' for a fix
He spent his last 80 cents on fare
He raises up and lets me get in his chair
Then I sit and take a snooze

Thunderous, I'm breakin' niggaz down to dust 
The rhyme sorceror forces you to shout my praises 
Phenomenal phrases hit you like exploding razors 

Now who put the West up on the map? 
Perhaps you should run laps, you're wack with a stack of dumb raps 
Thumbtacks mark your headquarters 
You're dead when I slaughter, and now your head's leaking red water 
You shoulda been a donor, I'm prone to bone ya hoe 
Though she know I can flow, 'cause I showed her 
And now she's up on my shit, I'm slick

Who is running shit, A-Plus is the one to get 
Foul, if you think I'm flippin' on the man with the skills 
Niggaz get the dills, still

I pound the lights 'cause they haven't found the light 
But I never taught ya discipline, feel my fist again

Mindstate of niggaz that I'm greater, none of that later 
We can do this I wreck blocks like Brutus 
It's not a chore ta, make you come up shorter 
'cause niggaz know I'm sure to serve without takin no orders 
So here's a tip from the hip to your dips 
Get with the man who rips, stop being stalled by them drips 
I'll do you swell, I got better aim than Willie Tell 
I rung so let me ring your bell 
DING-DONG! My sing song swells like a Samolian 
Stuck in my pocket, I simply rock it 

Call it splat on your face when you try to face the match 
You're tripping you're slipping you're sliding off my fly blend

Peace to the niggaz who got my back and 
Everyone else can get the dills

A word against me; I serve an MC, simply.
Put, like my foot up your anus, ya Shamus.

You know the time; now that I'm older I'm gonna
Rip niggaz heads with the said salutations.
Introducing Del, and his bid for boostin' tales
Of my adventures; attempt to try,
And you will limp or die; whichever I choose, you lose.
Crews get ashamed 'cause we blame 'em for bitin'.

You're swept in a hurricane; Del'll blow your brain,
So your next generations of youth will be facin' the truth,
And the truth is I'll leave you with the loose tooth.
Gums get split if you bit.
I'll extract the truth out your ass, like I'm standin' in the pulpit.
Or a lie dectector wrecked ya sector, when you're standing.
I can swing, branding, expanding, on what I'm handing
To the people, 'cause we will, and you can't say
A damn thing about it if you doubt it.
You're already outta line, so let me remind your behind
About the switch, which I used to bruise your bottom.
That little nigga tried to cut; I caught him.
He didn't think that I would see that.
So be that, and be off the D, 'cause we rap.
We sap the strength and lap the length around the whole course of time,
And still got the time to unwind.

Hurl as your world is crushed because I gotta make you hush.
You gotta be eliminated; the way I demonstrate it.

Nowhere to run to; exits are blocked off.
Steadily I'm dissin' men; I hope you're listenin'.

Others ride my jock like a bicycle, but I'm psycho.
Fools try to play me like Tyco; gotsta pull the rifle.
Daisy, graze the ass with the B-B.
It comes speedy; sign the peace treaty,
Or you'll be needin'
Medical attention when I leave you bleedin'.
Throw a monkey wrench in your program;
Crammed up your ass and it's just too bad, son;
Catch a bad one.

Until they sing notes like a canary

Be the best, so lets test this

I could never talk to you

With the best of luck

By pullin' out a wad of bucks
Shucks
I need to stop this
I plop this, played this
I murder MCs

Del the Funky Homosapien,"It's time for me
I never rhyme for free
At least pay attention
You know, let your mind be free
I think by now everyone knows
My funk flows will ease the pain
Because MCs we brain
Make 'em nervous
Here for your service
Infer this
Clear to any rapper that is wacka
I'll slap ya
I talk shit that's amazin'
The days spent
Inside my crib producin' had me boostin' my confidence
Now I will stomp some sense
Into those numbskulls
I leave 'em dumb-dull
I thank you the listener
Cause if it was up to me
If y'all was girls
I'd be kissin' ya
And the brothers get phat pounds
And goin' round is phat pounds of indo
No brown
I puff sess at the rest
Unless they have the bomb beta
And now my mom made a turnaround
She wasn't concerned & clowned

Now I get ends & my job is not pretend,

Your neighbors lose some sleep (I want to thank you)...""

Nourished ny hunger
Sure, it's me indulgin'
Never will I bullshit some other finna frame
If you're a beginner here's my name
DeL! myster, ya shyster
I'll heist your jewels & tolls & leave ya fooled
Moot,
I never get soot
My ends that I got last year will probably still get resooped
I know y'all're sick'n tired of these weakassniggas makin' records
So just check what I delivers
I send shivers down ya spine
I'm incline to bind and put together clever conversation
Cause I'm dope without the leather
Whether or not, my spot is never taken
Or forever breakin' on new rhymers
They flock around, want to be down & two timers
I will design a flow that will remind ya
Dumbasshoes and a path go
Go to a spot where I know that the grass's sold,

Everything I do yes it's true it's meant for mental renovation 

With innovation laced it, embalming fluid 

flew it through your speaker do it make you want to seek your soul 

like Nat King Cole, my shit is gold 

I hold a pole of polarity, like a wand and fondle phrases

My minions were preparing for my birth to unearth the black core

Keep evildoers outside with fences

the burst of energy 'cause it's affordable of course 

there's more to throw, to the sharks, and modify the marks

This is a federal food fight
(You better know it!)
That means we're callin out all you kooks and crooks
(What?! We're about to rip this shit)
Oh, me? My name is Humpty Hump
(There's a party in here, baby)
I'm the original big-nosed rapper, baby
(You better get down with this, baby)
We're about to sling hot food all over this piece
(Just nothing but a food fight!)
Here we go, back in the house for the 9-whatever
(Foood fiiiiiggghht)
With the bacon and egg sandwich

[Humpty Hump]
You ain't bringing groceries, g
Your groove is getting rude over records
But can you sling the food like this?!
You better bite this
If you want to make the people move like this
Chez wa, Allah, cheese burger
Flame broil base, my pickle make ya wiggle
You're busted, my mustard will wax your whole plate
By itself, not including all my funky condiments
Nod your head to this and DUCK DOWN
As I commence to lock and load a fresh cantaloupe
Yo, I'm illin! I'm slingin melons
Like the felons are slangin dope sacks
So max but I wouldn't stand so close up in the light
Either bring it or hide
Cause it's about to be a food fight!

[Chorus]
(You need something for the food fight!)
We hit you in the neck with a cheeseburger
(Gotta bring food to the food fight!)
Yeah, bruh, we hit you in the neck with a cheeseburger!

[Del]
It's classic
Slapping brothers with some lettuce from jurasstic
I counteract it with the Shock with ham hocks
From brothers who might Tupac
Fifty-seven black [????] and lots of flows
Fat like hippopotamoes, still caught em though
In the face with excrements, peep my testaments
I bring the seasoning paprika
Eureka for the weaker, and smoke the reefer
Dribble up the funk in the beaker
And, yes, about to say ?speaker'
It leaks in your ears and years ahead
I went to Japan and they was throwing pork balls
But I'm calling protocol, stooop!

[Chorus]
(You need something for the food fight)
We banked you in the neck with the cheeseburger
(Gotta bring something for the food fight)
Yes, we're slugging the chicken nugget to your grill
(You need something for the food fight)
Get ready, we're coming fetti with the groceries
(Gotta bring food to the food fight!)
Someone shoulda told ya, it ain't over till it's over

[Humpty]
Now if I am what I eat I hope I ain't a big couchie
Gotta substitute the ?ouch' for the ?ooch'!
If so, I hate to see my man Donnie O, he'd be a butthell
Substitute the ?ell' for the ?ole'
Actually, factually hella fools I know would be toe up
If you was what you ate, no fakin
My man Nate would be a plate of bacon
My brother Shock popcorn, and my cat would be a rat
My girlfriend would be some super sperm and things
My rich nigga Pac would be a lobster with hot wings
It's quite simple, if true that my temple is wrecked
I'd be some mushrooms and cognac
I'd be a pinto bean gravy smothered neck bone
Scrilla taker, vanilla wafer, baker, filler
So come on with your food slingin cause I'm ready
Bring it ­ SHUT UP! Nigga, sing it

[Chorus]
Bring the groceries",Food Fight,1996
Del the Funky Homosapien,"I'm ready for action, packing provisions of visions
Verbally, every word will be enhanced
With the bass that'll put you in a trance
Some dance, come take a chance
Del won't do you wrong
I've been in the rap game too long to falter
I rock like Gibraltar
Make you kneel to the butt like an altar
We move to prove that this is improved, when you're at-water
Caught em with vibration that soothes your back like massages
Before you can park your car in garages
It'll be just for riders, listening to 'Rock The Bells'
You can barely hear the vocals
Mixing is important, getting the public into chokeholds
Hip hop homo's will do well to know this
It ain't about who's the dopest
It's who gets the fan's focus upon you
When they feel what the song do
I think I'm onto something, when I got my shit pumping
I remember, when they were satisfied with just lyrics
Now, if the music 's flat
I can barely stand to hear it
And my rhymes are impeccable and you can't dissect my flow
With music sounding like it's out of tin cans
Just wretch the whole vibe and stride for perfection
Why you think they call this a profession? Hey

[Chorus: x2]
Can't forget the bass, the bottom got em crawling to the wall man
We got cassettes, CD's and LP's
DJ's for days, whatever you do
Give it your all, cause that's what pays

I just love when I can hear the bump pleading to the walls
In the halls, coming from the record stores in the malls
A beat with walls I like that
It bites back and strikes back
At niggaz who are wack, 'cause
Back in the day when hip hop was just developing
It was back in the day
We should be relishing in experience
All you newcomers better be leery cause
Hieroglyphics got the bump
And it ain't mysterious

[Chorus]

This don't apply to the niggaz who salved
And fell out of their fam base
Trying to chase the big bucks
It sucks, I know, when your heroes want to appear to hoes
Supermacho! And watch the whole role and image of a mic champion
To the fam base it simply can't be done
'Cause they're your folks when you don't get the prop shit
They know you got the top shit and in it only for profit
But since we on the topic, let me drop it
We need to stop this segregation of hip hop
Talking 'bout fuck the east coast, and fuck the west
He's sold out, cause someone either sings a notion in the chorus
What is real hip hop then? Only the shit you listen to
Everything else pretending, I'm sending a message to my fam base
Fuck this is hip hop and this is rap, it came from the same place
And there's a place for everything including hieroglyphics
And we gonna come with it, as long as y'all with it
'Cause the fam base is like a legion
For one cause, we want the dope shit cause
The other got flossed ??? Now
I'm a fan who likes a lot of different things
I differentiate with music just to spread my wings
I always do my best, that's why the fans love me
Not some crime shit, so I can pop bubbly
We all got some preferences, that's just how it goes
But when you see there's an effort being made, don't turn up your nose
Turn up the bass, race to go and buy it
Some of y'all love it - don't you, don't deny it

Each rap is texture-mapped to perfection
A 3-D world for you to step in
I leave MC's stranded on asteroids
Floatin through the void of space
Del the black man, African back again
Crackin windshields, so I can heal your souls
When you feel my flows
A wild beast when I piece together beats like puzzles
MCs feel muzzled like dobermans
Its over when you try duplicate
And then your tooth'll ache for tryin to sink your teeth in
Meetin your maker, Del the caretaker here break your life
Away from you faker the Tammy Faye Baker
I shake your brain up like Quaker Oats
For tryin to memorize my maniacal quotes
The funk coats your eardrums, Oaklands where we're from
The deviant, workin feverishly but easily
Eagerly awaiting your arrival
Hide all you cowards
You're powerless I'm live and in technicolor and tumorous
Your humorous, my rhymes are numerous
I'm too elaborate in my habitat
With words that hit your skull like a battle ax, imagine that
I'm actually destined cause I'm acutal perfection
Equals natural selection with rhymes as my secret weapon
This involvement in my newest installment
Is dissolved in the chains on your brains like solvent

Giant robos and ponos, and road shows
I like to blow dough on the latest, not the status quo though
More pull than yo-yo duncan
Puttin passion in my rappin like a tongue kiss and right on by the hundreds
With no bass the foundation crumbles
Like niggaz bumble they whole life over rumbles
Scandals, sure you got hand skills
But unless you gonna be a boxer who's gonna offer
Your hand scrill? (Nobody) I used to program computers
Now I make manuvers on the mic to screw ya
On the ole, how it goes how the flow for the uninitiated

No defense for your pretense
Which is just a feat to proposal
Towards your disposal
Del flow solo, fully mobilized the wise words
So niggaz can get the total
Perception, perfection destined for greatness
Etched in your consciousness, metaphorically monstrous

No way out come right in, writin incredible shit
They can't meddle with us
Future development is too intelligent
Future development, too too intelligent
No way out come right in, writin incredible shit
You can't meddle with us

Come on and let the games begin
Cause the games begin when you're coolin with your friends
And the friends to the end that don't pretend
So have fun, have fun, have fun while it lasts

[ VERSE 1 ]
It's time to max, relax, ask anybody
You got off work, you know your boss is a jerk
Whether you a clerk or a rapper like me
We all need to kick back and be carefree
See, no plead-bargainin, no haboring
Negative attitudes when you're out with your dudes
Damn, it feels good when the weekend comes
Done finished the homework, you're out with the bums
Clownin, you're all down in whatever goes
You throw on a tape and hear a nigga kick his flows
Cruise down the strip and pop at some hoes
y'all still havin fun no matter what scenario you chose
Even on a solo with hoes, take off your clothes
But not without the condoms cause that's ( ? )
Those wake up the next day call your partners
Pitch in four or ten and start the festivities
No fuckin worries when you're livin free of stress
That's why we only smoke bomb, fuck sess
y'all feel the best when y'all say let's act a fool 
Cause it's June and it's cool cause we out of school

[ CHORUS ]
[ VERSE 2 ]
Your friends are your friends like no matter what
Other fools get cut from your team
It seems like they dream of gettin next to you
But all they really do is pester you
Cause they marks, always want to start funk when you with em
Cause when he got beef with a nigga he thinks y'all'll get him
Now he rollin with yo crew, but with no crew
He wouldn't be poppin doodoo
His ass would be through, but now he drug you into it
And yes, all your boys
And now you gotta kill the noise
He destroys the whole vibe by frontin
Tryin to be hard
But he just Napoleon Bonaparte
A little nigga tryin to take command
Thinkin he the man
But fuckin with him y'all'll all kick the can
I can't stand a fake
I kick it with my real niggas come spring break
That's the ones I look out for, never doubt your pals
Fuck them gals and don't ever let em separate you
Your friends ( ? ) when that bitch hates you
And I say

[ CHORUS ]
[ VERSE 3 ]
Now when you got business to attend
Take care of that and afterwards fuck with your friends
Don't put shit off till tomorrow
Do it right now 'fore you fuck with your pals
That's the down period, rest and relaxation
At the nigga Plus' house, let's go to Nations
And get fits, when life is the pits
You know I check my friends, make sure they legit
Whether it's freestylin you know we smilin
Niggas pilin up with the gin in a cup
Or a blunt and Olde English so niggas can get fiendish
Playin NBA Jams and just like the beats we slam and dunk
Callin niggas punks but we just poppin junk
Playin dozens, cause we like cousins
And brothers, I wouldn't have it any other way
You know what they say, all work and no play

Del the Funky Homosapien,"Okay
[Chorus]
You got to know what your love is worth
Baby boy you got to know what your love is worth
Baby girl you got to know what your love is worth
Everybody got to know what their love is worth

Yeah, you got to know what your love is worth
As soon as a child is born and discovers earth
It's a part of life, so don't get fucked in the end
If someone's a lost cause, they'll be summoned up to start again
Example, you a woman, in a relationship
It seems like everything you do makes him flip
It ain't physical violence, or nothing like that
But the love that you show he doesn't show back
But it started when you first met
You looked incredible to him, he wanted to get his thirst wet 
(yeah, I bet)
He wanted to be down like Brandy
At first his overbearing persona was so manly (oh)
But now you're thinkin' most of the time, ""he can't stand me""
He lost trust in you when he saw you with Randy (haha)
But then you find out he feel good about Candy
You thinkin' this relationship is really demanding
Everyone makes mistakes and that's true
But from the beginning did he really love you?
To him you a bitch, he told his boys he dug you out
And nowadays he don't even hug you (doubts)
And I'm sure it do more than bug you
You wonder how you get attracted to these
With a mackin' disease, with a tactic to please
But once you settle down you're entrapped in a squeeze
Like a boa constrictor and he know when he gets ya
You got to know what your love is worth
That way you don't waste it on the world goin berserk
Yeah

[Chorus:Repeat x2]

Now put yourself in the shoes of this guy
You fall in love with this girl and you don't know why (why dude?)
Cause you don't feel the same but you give it a try
Eyes wide, like you a child in a candy store
Even though you the one she couldn't stand before
Cause you was houndin' her, surroundin' her (damn) with confusion
You used to be friends, but now the friendship is losin'
Cause you visualize the romance, she like ""no hands on""
She don't want to fuck with no man, ""not even a slow dance?""
You tried to kiss her and she even agrees
But that don't mean you 'bout to be Adam and Eve
In the Garden of Eden, but maybe for the evening
You say she leading you on, but you just added pressure
Of course she like you, you're friends don't try to test her
She says she likes you as a friend, not a lover or wife
So get a life, let her live hers and find another
Don't let her smash her ego, cause we know you're great
Let it be her mistake, yeah
Don't waste your time bro cause you know
If she don't appreciate what he do for her
Then tell me why he should wait around

Stress the world

Stress the world
Stress the world
Stress the world, stress the world....

I offer the maximum that you call for who better to get a crowd to go bloww!!!!
Del, champion of true I do what the others can't do
So when ya come to, recognize I despise weak
I'm at my peak I seek more then the boredom that you are accustomed to
The conoseur I love hip-hop more, then I did as a kid so I gotta get rid
Of those who pose, case closed
I'm dynamic with panic and that's exactly how I planned it

[Chorus]
You better peep 'cause the price steep for those who sleep
I pile my rhymes by the heap on cassettes, Lp's, cd's and 12 inches
Perform the shit and get the girl like pinches
With good intentions, the key word is redemption
For those who try to shit on my crown let's get down
Plastic ass rappers get smashed like crackers
First I shalack ya and hit ya with the lacquer
Then I go to marijuana class to study cultivation
So I can make the USA a better nation
Get smoked, mellow out, vibe fuck the stress
While I kill MC's that say ""he's relentless.""
Past you at last due to technological enhancements on my part the art advances
My rhymes are ravishing, ravaging the hip-hop surface
To get to the underground for pounds and purchase
Merciless, as soon as I insert the disc
into the SP to make the world stress me
Let's be upfront and real
What's up with this rap regurgitation that appeal to the masses?
I got pure plain funk hold the Mayo
Like the formulation of ice crystals make the suns halo a rainbow
Painful to MC's at large I barge and bulldoze them all when I charge
Personally responsible, behind all the hoopla
Haven't crossed the board, get the troubleshoota

[Chorus]
Stress the world...( make the world stress me)
Stress the world...( make the world stress me)
Stress the world...( make the world stress me)
Let's be upfront and real

Mathematically correct, collect wreck on the daily
This ain't Prince project put out on plays the part
Deep dark funk to dunk your face in
Fully animated in a time when hip-hop's contaminated
Wit corny niggaz talkin jibberish they make me feverish
I merely pull this lever which enables me to unveil tails of Del in action
Smoked to fullest, project my voice like bullets
I deflect you sect. I check the scanner
Damn you're persistent, I stand wit my fist clenched
Tightly around the microphone like a septer
Wit rhymes average MC's can't see like a specter
The inspector with the nectar, sharp like a Black and Decker
I twist a nigga neck like chubby checker
Respect the Hieroglyphic insignia
you know it means murda wit lyrics unhearda
Stamina, stamina. And wit a new flow to boot
Don't try to execute my patter-ns
I took hella notes while battlin'
Dismantlin' opponents alone with my trusty verbs leavin' MC's disturbed
Everybody on my block know I rock
To MC's I'm hella cocky so I keep my rhymes cocked in position
And if you actually listen to what I'm sayin' you'll see you can't resist 'em
They're succulent and if you don't like them fuck you then
Anybody with taste see it's a delicacy
Not a mere orderve or haven't you heard
And it's totally take out about a million served like that
Absolutely a beauty to crush the shit that's booty
'cause I figures it's my duty

",Stress the World,1998
Del the Funky Homosapien,"They say that nice guys finish last, but I'm the leader
Drinkin' liters of Seagrams with the heathens
Misbehave and break the buzz, fuck the shavings
Collectin' scratch for my savings before the day ends
Cravings for music, collaborate at a rate
Faster than the speed of sound to go thataway
No replicas, step to us, I guess the job was left to us
To kick the phonics that kept you buzzed
And perkin', workin' words, distributin' herbs
To niggas livin' in 'burbs cause they too petro
To come to the ghetto
Mind you, all we do is find you, wave and gave you a sack
Come back but watch 50, they try to lift me
Off the tracks but we ain't offerin crack, just bomb
No need for alarm or bad karma, but arm yourself
Move in stealth, wealth is accumulated
Pockets are illuminated
I make the shit I think hit even though some assume you hate it
I pass judgment when the fuzz lit, take a shit
Just another skit comin' from the pit of Babylon
But powerful like Alvatron
From the Decepticons
Music is magical like a leprechaun
Kept you on point in many different sectors
On Elektra, make you remember Medgar Evers and James Evers
My skills sent from the heavens
I wish they sold Maddog at 7-11
I remember when niggas wore Thriller jackets
And Starter jackets and harder tactics
Had been adopted and most of y'all mocked it
But put a sock in it for a minute
I provide the funk and y'all rock with it
As I spit it, admit it, oh shit

[Chorus]
It's Del the Funky Homosapien
Goin' from town to town to town and just makin' friends
Reach out and shaking hands
With the public and they love it

No technical difficulties or faultiness, you salt me with
That plain-Jane-no-game-insane-to-the-brain
Don't need cocaine fuckin' with the A
The A-Pluster plus the A from way back in the day
For mind expansion enhancing thoughts
I'm raw with savagery, the majesty of all in vision
Wait, but isn't this a good way to start?
Developin' art to cart scrill to kill Satan
Plans for gettin' Daytons are past tense
Stack ends so I won't be a has-been (You know it)
The question you been askin: Is Del that masked man?
Rollin through our cities just rippin' major venues
Like Whitney Houston like when I went to Houston
My father is from Texas, so next bust a rhyme for times
I felt it was no hope, but no factors you formulate
Made me foster hatred and made me want to make it
When I'm in the Bay niggas say (Del, how you doin, man?)
I ain't no rap star that act hard, can't speak
I leak lyrics, freak lyrics, secrete lyrics
From my spirits
Tyranny for all who hear of me
Bomb in a bong, my feet in a thong
On a beach with a biatch named Bonbon
Called her on the Intercong, enter John Owens
Better known as Casual to y'all not knowin'
About flowin, cause your rhymes are all stolen
Another dip on the strip cause task force patrollin'
But rollin' blunts too fat to measure
Mexico's national treasure for pleasure
Resurrect tracks like this from my childhood
Before it was such a wild hood
Knock on wood

[Chorus]

My beats are meaty
Let's call a peace treaty
And stick to it
I'm quick to do it, are you?
So much funk you can't kick it with my crew
Other than when it's time to get blue?
(Shame on you)
I want me a girl that's intelligent
Doin' shit and ain't too belligerent
Picture it, chillin' backyard barbecue
Not trippin' off what niggas are to you
Jealousy, well let's see
It's a lot of that in Oakland
It started when niggas started smokin'
And snortin' hop, fuck pop
I want the melodies
But not the weak topics you are selling me
Del is free of confinements
My mind bendin' fragile and frazzled
I choose to stay underground like Fraggles
In battles I'm sure to win
While you smoke bud I drink gin
It sinks in while everyone else act on it
I macked on it but not too far from redrum
Don't push me, I'm not a pussy
I wish we could gather at a function, drink some lager
And just bust hymns of funk and flav
'Cause the slaves that are our ancestors
Would feel blessed if we did that
Before we hear rap
Now it's American children syntax
Ever since it been on wax
And that's the facts, believe it, don't mislead it
And don't do the shit if you don't need it
And that's real, you might not be but I am
The truth's gonna slap you in the face, so why scam?

Allow me to make this

Every child of peace
Every cloud and sea
You see with your eyes
I see destruction and demise (that's right)
Corruption in disguise
From this fuckin' enterprise
Now I'm sucked into your lies
Through Russel, not his muscles but percussion he provides
For me as a guide
Y'all can see me now 'cause you don't see with your eye
You perceive with your mind
That's the inner
So I'ma stick around with Russ' and be a mentor
Bust a few rhymes so motherfuckers remember where the thought is
I brought all this
So you can survive when law is lawless (right here)
Feelings, sensations that you thought was dead
No squealing, remember that it's all in your head

I don't be foolin', I hope these useless gooses stop the foolishness

Inclusive clairvoyance about a fear of enjoyment
Of hoes tryna snare em a billionaire boyfriend
Bitch your pussy's not gonna hold me

Know those streets from the solo creep
Know those beats
So don't sleep, that's how you get taken unaware
Aching for a Share, hatin' on a playa
Never wanna look toward, just sit there and look bored
And got the nerve to be materialistic when knowledge ain't nowhere on their wish list

And then they blow they whole goal
Don't even recognize inside they own soul

Love was a star, a song unsung

Today the world is old
You flew away and time grew cold
Where is that star that shone so bright
Ages ago last night?

To think that spring had depended
On merely this, a look, a kiss
To think that something so splendid
Could slip away in one little daybreak

And recollect the sighs and the kisses
The arms that clung

Delancey,"There are places I'll remember
All my life, though some have changed
Some forever, not for better
Some have gone and some remain
All these places had their moments
With lovers and friends, I still can recall
Some are dead and some are living
In my life, I've loved them all 

But of all these friends and lovers
There is no one compares with you
And these memories lose their meaning
When I think of love as something new
Though I know I'll never lose affection
For people and things that went before
I know I'll often stop and think about them
In my life, I'll love you more

Because you are so fine,
You meant more to me than gold,
Trusting you loving me,
But one mistake of my part, 
it wounded my heart,
What must I do,
To have you here again.

Let me hold your hands
And kiss your lips once more,
A promise is a promise, 
Stay forever yours,
Let me hold you close,
and feel you warm embrace,
'cause nothing on earth will ever take you place,
because I love you.

When I lost you girl, I died
I thought we had it all.
People said we'd last forever.
But I knew it wouldn't last. 
So I tried the best that I could,
To give the love that I should,
What must I say,
To have you here again.

And kiss your lips once more,
A promise is a promise,
I'll stay forever yours,
Let me hold you close,
And feel your warm embrace,

Because I love you.
