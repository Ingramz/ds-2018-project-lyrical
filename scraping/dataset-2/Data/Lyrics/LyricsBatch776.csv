Nelson Riddle,"She gets too hungry for dinner at eight 
She likes the theatre and never comes late 
She never bothers with people she'd hate 
That's why the lady is a tramp 

Doesn't like crap games with barons or earls 
Won't go to Harlem in ermine and pearls 
Won't dish the dirt with the rest of the girls 
That's why the lady is a tramp 

She likes the free, fresh wind in her hair 
Life without care 
She's broke, and it's ok

Hates California, it's cold and it's damp 
That's why the lady is a tramp 

She gets too hungry to wait for dinner at eight 
She loves the theatre but never comes late 
She'd never bother with people she'd hate 
That's why the lady is a tramp 

She'll have no crap games with sharpies and frauds 
And she won't go to Harlem in Lincolns or Fords 
And she won't dish the dirt with the rest of the broads 
That's why the lady is a tramp 

She'd love the free, fresh wind in her hair 
Life without care 
She's broke, but it's ok

Hates California, it's so cold and so damp 
That's why the lady 
That's why the lady
That's why the lady is a tramp",The Lady Is a Tramp,2008
Nelson Riddle,"The falling leaves drift by the window
The autumn leaves of red and gold
I see your lips, the summer kisses
The sun-burned hands I used to hold

Since you went away the days grow long
And soon I'll hear old winter's song
But I miss you most of all my darling
When autumn leaves start to fall

C'est une chanson, qui nous ressemble
Toi tu m'aimais et je t'aimais
Nous vivions tous deux ensemble
Toi qui m'aimais moi qui t'aimais
Mais la vie separe ceux qui s'aiment
Tout doucement sans faire de bruit
Et la mer efface sur le sable les pas des amants desunis",Autumn Leaves,2008
Nelson Riddle,"Yesterday you came my way,
And when you smiled at me,
In my heart I felt a thrill you see,
That it was love at sight and
I was right to love you as I do.
Still I never dreamed that you could love me too.

Your eyes of blue, your kisses too,
I never knew what they could do.
I can't believe that you're in love with me.

You're telling ev'ry one I know
I'm on your mind each place we go
They can't believe that you're in love with me.

I have always placed you far above me.
I just can't imagine that you love me.
And after all is said and done,
To think that I'm the lucky one.
I can't believe that you're in love with me.

Skies are gray. I'm blue each day
When you are not around.
Ev'ry thing goes wrong, my dear I've found
But when you're by my side I fill with pride
For I'm so proud of you
It all seems too good to me to all be true

Your eyes of blue, your kisses too,
I never knew what they could do.
I can't believe that you're in love with me.

You're telling ev'ry one I know
I'm on your mind each place we go
They can't believe that you're in love with me.

I have always placed you far above me.
I just can't imagine that you love me.
And after all is said and done,
To think that I'm the lucky one.
I can't believe that you're in love with me.",I Can't Believe That You're in Love with Me [From the Caine Mutiny],2008
Nelson Riddle,"Born free, as free as the wind blows
As free as the grass grows
Born free to follow your heart

Live free and beauty surrounds you
The world still astounds you
Each time you look at a star

Stay free, where no walls divide you
You're free as the roaring tide
So there's no need to hide

Born free, and life is worth living
But only worth living 
'Cause you're born free

(Stay free, where no walls divide you)
You're free as the roaring tide
So there's no need to hide

Born free, and life is worth living
But only worth living 
'Cause you're born free",Born Free,2008
Nelson Riddle,"Hear my voice where you are
Take a train, steal a car
Hop a freight, grab a star, come back to me
Catch a plane, catch a breeze
On your hands, on your knees
Swim or fly, only please, come back to me
On a mule, in a jet
With your hair in a net
In a towel wringing wet
I don't care, this is where you should be
From the hills, from the shore
Ride the wind to my door
Turn the highway to dust
Break the law if you must
Move the world, only just come back to me
Blast your hide, hear me call
Must I fight City Hall
Here and now, damn it all, come back to me
What on Earth must I do
Scream and yell till I'm blue
Curse your soul when will you come back to me?
Have you gone to the moon or the corner saloon
Or to wreck and to ruin
Mademoiselle, where in Hell can you be?
Leave a sign on your door
Out to lunch ever more
In a Royce or a van, wrapped in mink or Saran
Anyway that you can, come back to me
Hear my voice through the din
Feel the waves on your skin
Like a call from within, come back to me
Leave behind all your own
Tell your flowers you will phone
Let your dog walk alone, come back to me
Let your tub overflow
If a date waits below
Let him wait for Godot
Come by rail,
Come by mail, COD
Par avion, par bateau
Dans une vielle, deux chevaux
Come by steam, come by gas
Call for free on a pass
On the drags and the glass, come back to me
Leave your bills all unpaid
Let your bed go unmade
Your souffle unsouffled, come back to me
Come by sail, come by freight
In a box or a tray, keep your head on the plate
I don't care this is where you should be
Come in pain or in joy
As a girl, as a boy
In a bag or a trunk (Shut up!)
On a horse or a drunk
In the flora or faun, come back to me
Come back to me, come back

""Will you stop bothering me?""",Come Back to Me,2008
Nelson Riddle,"The shadow of your smile
When you have gone
Will color all my dreams
And light the dawn

Look into my eyes my love and see
All the lovely things you are to me

Our wistful little star
It was far, too high
A teardrop kissed your lips
And so did I

Now when I remember spring
All the joys that love can bring
I will be remembering
The shadow of your smile",Shadow of Your Smile,2008
Nelson Riddle,"Softly I will leave you softly 
For my heart would break if you should wake and see me go
So I leave you softly long before you miss me
Long before your arms can beg me to stay
For one more hour or one more day
After all the years I can't bear the tears to fall so 
Softly, as I leave you there
 
Softly I will leave you softly 
For my heart would break if you should wake and see me go
So I leave you softly long before you miss me
Long before your arms can beg me to stay
For one more hour or one more day
After all the years I can't bear the tears to fall so 
Softly, as I leave you there

Nelson Riddle,"Let the drums roll out
Let the trumpet call 
While the people shout 
""Strike up the band""

Callin' one and all 
To the martial swing

There is work to be done, to be done

Nelson Riddle,"Walk away, please go
Before you throw your life away
A life that I could share for just a day
We should have met some years ago
For your sake I say
Walk away, just go.

Walk away, and live
A life that's full
With no regret
Don't look back at me
Just try to forget
Why build a dream that cannot come true
So be strong, reach the stars now
Walk away, walk on.

If I heard your voice
I'd beg you to stay
So don't say a word
Just run, run away.

Goodbye my love
My tears will fall
Now that you've gone
I can't help but cry
But I must go on
I'm sad that I after searching so long
Knew, I loved you, but I told you

Nelson Riddle,"There may be trouble ahead,
But while there's music and moonlight,
And love and romance,
Let's face the music and dance.
Before the fiddlers have fled,
Before they ask us to pay the bill,
And while we still have that chance,
Let's face the music and dance.
Soon, we'll be without the moon,
Humming a different tune, and then, 
There may be teardrops to shed,
So while there's music and moonlight,
And love and romance,
Let's face the music and dance.",Let's Face the Music and Dance [1967 Recording],2008

Nelson Riddle,"Goodbye, No use leading with our chins,
This is where our story ends,
Never lovers, ever friends.

Goodbye, Let our hearts call it a day,
But before you walk away,
I sincerely want to say:

I wish you bluebirds in the Spring,
To give your heart a song to sing;
And then a kiss, but more than this I wish you love.

And in July, a lemonade,
To cool you in some leafy glade;
I wish you health and more than wealth, I wish you love.
My breaking heart and I agree
That you and I could never be,
So with my best, my very best, I set you free.

I wish you shelter from the storm,
A cozy fire to keep you warm;
But most of all, when snowflakes fall,
I wish you love.

I kiss you

Don't even try to date her on the phone!

Well, now, sweet baby, that we're Goin' Steady,
I'll pull up and ask your daddy 
What he thinks, if you and I are wed.
'Cause I love you and you love me,
We're both as happy as we can be, 
And I hope your daddy will let you go steady with me.
We'll get the ring, then be on our way
To see the preacher man,
And when I say: ""I do, sweetheart!""
I'll slip the ring on your lovin' hand
Ev'ry thing's gonna turn out fine,
I'll be yours and you'll be mine,

He must be ready to pay

That used to be there you could see where they'd been washed away
By too many through the day twelve o'clock tales

Was tinged with the sadness of a great love for me

And only last year everything seemed so sure
Now life is awful again

A week in Paris could ease the bite of it

A winding country lane all russet brown,
A frosty window pane shows me a town grown lonely.
That spring of ours that started so April-hearted,
Seemed made for just a boy and girl.

The music of the universe around me, or was that a nightingale?
And then your arms miraculously found me,suddenly the sky turned pale,
I could see the midnight sun.

Was there such a night, it's a thrill i still don't quite believe,
But after you were gone, there was still some stardust on my sleeve.

But practically everything leaves me totally cold
The only exception I know is the case
When I'm out on a quiet spree
Fighting vainly the old ennui
And I suddenly turn and see your fabulous face

I get no kick from champagne
Mere alcohol doesn't thrill me at all
So tell me why should it be true
That I get a kick out of you

Some they may go for a cocaine
I'm sure that if I took even one sniff
It would bore me terrifically too
Yet I get a kick out of you

I get a kick every time I see you
Standing there before me
I get a kick though it's clear to see
You obviously do not adore me

I get no kick in a plane
Flying too high
With some gal in the sky
Is my idea of nothing to do
Yet I get a kick
You give me a boot

What a rare mood I'm in

And order anything you see
Have fun you happy people

Pardon me, but I gotta run

I gotta find who's now number one

And then our lips were meeting
And Venus seemed to melt right into Mars

It turned out to be the luckiest day I've known

In London town
It had me low
And it had me down

I viewed the morning
With much alarm
The British Museum
Had lost its charm

How long I wondered
Could this thing last
But the age of miracles
It hadn't past

For suddenly
I saw you standing right there
And in foggy London town
The sun was shining, shining, shining, shining, shining everywhere

Out in West Virginia
Is a little college

All the student body
Only cared for football
Never mind the knowledge
(Rah, Rah, Rah)

Never mind the sheepskin
They preferred the pigskin
Seemed to have it in their bones
Yeah, they knew all about it

Couldn't do without it
All except a certain Mr. Jamboree Jones
And he played the clarinet with all his might
He studied night and day, he practiced day and night

No runnin' up the field for Mr. Jones
He'd rather run up the scale and down the scale,
What tones.
Even though his buddies

Always cut their studies
To attend the rallies
(Rah, Rah, Rah)
While they all were rootin'

You could hear him tootin'
""What's become of Sally""
(Rah, Rah, Rah)
How they used to hate him

Co-eds wouldn't date him
Thought he was an awful bore
Oh, but he liked his rhythm
More than being with `em

So he'd only turn in
For to practice some more
And meanwhile the team marched on to greater fame
Till they were asked to play that famous Rose Bowl game

And on that day of days the students beamed
What did they do when the team marched on the scene
I want to tell you ladies and you gentlemen, they screamed.
Rah, Rah, Rah, Rah

Biff-boom-bah, bah-bah-dee-addle-oh
Yea-ho, watch `em go
Startin' from the kick-off,
They pulled every trick off

But they couldn't win it
(No, no, no)
Instead of goin' forwards
They were goin' backwards

`Bout a mile a minute
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Seein' their position
They called intermission

And they heard the referee say
Hey, seventeen to nothin'
Ain't exactly nothin'
And you've only got about a minute to play

And then from the stand there came a distant wail
And it was Jamboree a-swingin' ""Hold `em Yale""
(Bula, bula, bula)
And then the students all began to yell

The players marched up the field
And down the field, pell mell.
Now on a certain West Virginia hill
There stands that college still

I'm ride for niggas, that ride for me 
Knowing in my heart that these same niggas would die for me 
Bleed, tears of love for lost blood 
You can see the pain in my eyes and what it does and why 
I don't give a fuck whether I live or die 
I'm a paint this world a portrait of my mind 
Show 'em, if they deny it blow 'em 
Past me the iron let me bite them wit' the bulldog made by design 
Niggas gon' give me mines 
And get in line for the torture 
I swear, run any closer to air 
My bullets travel wit' prayers 
Guns blazin' in pairs 
Who the nigga you fear 
Ja Rule, motherfucker 
All my hoes and hustlers 
Ride wit' me 
Get a feelin' on how this world did me 
Was curious 'till it all hit me 
But its clear now 
Though it's a narrow hall that I stare down 
I'm huggin' the bars kissin' the ground 
Fuckin' around wit' the Rule nigga 
What you tryin to do 
Make me put a hole in you 
And your bitch too 
Let's make this an issue 
How we do it thug style 
Turn the lights off world 
Enter the lockdown 

I could see it in your eyes 
Y'all niggas is scared of us 
Declarin' us the world's most dangerous 
You don't want to see me rise 

Because when we get high we get 'em 
Should have seen how we did' em 
Must a been the weed in 'em 
But as long as I'm alive 
I'm a show the world my struggle 
My pain, my hunger, my hustle 
You can put it on my life 
Cause I do it for my niggas 
For the love of my bitches 
If you wit' me, feel this 

This is a nigga livin' his life 
In gripes wit' the world 
I need to be high and cop ice girl 
Fuck a price girl 
With no problems at all 
I'm ready to ball 
On call killers from Atlanta to Dainamall 
N-why baby, you see why 
We the world's murderous guys 
With Mafia ties 
Fuck around and die 
It found myself me and my nine 
Doin' a jooks stickin' to crime 
A true crook in 9-9 
My nigga you holdin' me down 
We fuck around 
And start killin' these clowns 
We're hittin' 'em now 
Fools, lie down 
Quaters to halves to pounds 
Nigga I'm seein' triple of the breakdown 
That's what I make now 
And nothin' flake now 
Fuck the law 
50-50 love showed across the board 
I'm a crook ready for war 
Motherfucker spittin' gutter for sure 
That's on my life pushin' the ready 
Rock steady 
On every block, aight!

Blaze to the death and die with dignity 
For the life of me 
I just want to remain 
A nigga that's loyally loved through his levels of pain 
And I won't be contained 
Even if you incarcerate 
Still I'm only in chains 
Bury bread and stash the range 
It's how a thug would do things

Too inclined

Is a nigga you watch 
Make him easy to dot 
Send him in a rag-gedy box

My lust for sluts and whores? 
I'm a wild nigga

[ VERSE 1: Ron see ]
It was 1-9-8-6
I had the crack in the mix
Makin my propers, gettin paid, stackin a grip
From 20's to bitches, from haps to hoes
On the corner pushin boulders, livin way too bold
My bank roll start gettin hecka big
Then a snitchin rat bitch cold turned me in
Went and bit my lip, got swoll' and shit
Now it's 1995, I be tellin the tip
Some brothers is dyin, some brothers gettin rich
Callin theyself 9-5 crack dealer pimp
Ain't that a trip, that's how I thought, fool
Lookin at these young bucks I see myself, dude
But they don't hear you though
I'm tryin to tell em so
When you're broke as a joke, player, you can sell dope
Puttin your life on the line, you gets no hoe
All because you want to be the man sellin kilos

	(11 tons of Columbian leaves
	...ki's of heroine powder turned State's evidence)
	(I remember back...when he started
	The guys who last in this business
	Are the guys would fly straight
	Low key, quiet...)

Time's movin up, put your man out on the cut
If he bangin, hangin, or tryin to come up
Got that lleyo when he pumps it for the fiends to smoke
Cause he really ain't down with bein broke
He does it on the under, and teach young fools
Don't want the spot hot, player, keep it on the cool
He takes no losses, avoids all snitches
Cause life ain't nothin but money, fuck bitches
And when you cross the gate he never hesitates
He'll hook you up straight, cause he always got weight
Bodyguards watch his back, he watch them too
Cause if they catch him slippin, they'll jump this fool
And though he makes his money from fools gettin high
He's doin what he's doin tryin to get by
Cause a pusher's got a purpose, the pusher's got a plan
He's king of the kilo, but the pusher is a man
...was a damn youngster

I know you know the subject
So all you bustas get checked
Pusherman's a hustler that you gotta respect
He likes nice cars, and lots of guns
Saves 50's, 100's and burns the 1's
He's large, no doubt, that's what it's all about
And when he's high-sidin, can't keep playa out his mouth
Say that dope is his thang, and he does it the best
But at night he tried to sleep, but could not rest
So he centered his life around all that crack
And had two bodyguards watchin his back
Got his crew together and didn't waste no time
Till some sucker-ass nigga straight dropped the dime
And told the feds everything he knew
About the pusherman and his so-called crew
They say what goes up, will take a nose dive
The pusherman didn't make it to see '95

	(...80% of them are drug cases, and why?
	Cause everybody out there is a crackhead
	Doctors, lawyers, housewives
	Cocaine is America's cup of coffee)

	(We're supposed to protect our people, not destroy them)
	(Look at his arms, he loves that shit more than he loves us)

Petite fraîcheur, t'es peut être mannequin
Mais t'es loin d'être une fille modèle
Tu aimes te shooter à tes shootings
Car tu jouis d'une vie moderne
Tu passes ton temps à te défiler
Tes adversaires défilent et
J'aime tes collants effilés
Te compare pas à des filles laides
Même à l'école, t'es populaire comme t'es
Tu comptes plus les compliments récoltés
Et, dans tes soirées, y'a du monde au balcon
Mais je ne parle pas de ton décolleté
Je suis un mec à part, on vient pas de la même dimension
J'essaye de mener ma barque et, toi, tu me parles d'immenses yachts
Je côtoie des filles de mon âge et puis des filles âgées
Mais, même en amour, je vois peu de défis
Tellement de vautours, la durée de vie s'achète
Tout le monde autour semble me dévisager
Tu fais des galas dans ton habitation
Car tu penses que la richesse fait rêver le monde
Je suis venu car j'ai reçu ton invitation
Mais je me sens mal à l'aise dans ces événements

T'obéis à des schémas louches

Mais tes robes viennent de chez Manoush
Et c'est marrant comme Isabelle
Certaines de tes copines te disent antipathique
Tu vas de boutique en boutique Antik Batik
Mais t'es qu'une enfant qui déguise sa peine
Ton visage angélique change quand tu mélanges des liqueurs
C'est étrange mais ton géniteur pense plus à ses enjoliveurs
Ta maman s'égosille chaque fois qu'tu te bousilles
T'as encore abusé hier
On te pardonne pour tes beaux yeux
Ah, on s'exporte, en sexe, on s'explose
Je suis le premier ex-pauvre à t'emmener voir des expos

Comme si t'aimais qu'on t'fasse du mal, tu ne les arrêtais plus
Une petite princesse ne devrait pas devenir la reine des putes
Un ange passe, les ailes déployées
Moment de flottement
Rappelle-toi comme t'y croyais fort
Avant qu'le premier homme te mente
Tu t'es ouvert les poignets à cause d'un autre avortement
Tes marques peuvent en témoigner
Toi, t'es comme une môme, les mots te manquent
Tu fais aucun effort
Tu veux plus craquer chaque homme charmé
Par ton caractère se contentera de regarder
Ton cœur est un coffre-fort
T'as dû t'armer, te cacher derrière un masque
Et passer ton temps à te braquer
T'es plus la même qu'autrefois (ié-ié-ié)

Même si tout a changé je suis resté le même
J'les entends parler, dis-moi de quoi ils se mêlent
J'ai laissé mes démons du passé
Toutes mes erreurs derrière moi, loin derrière moi
Plus le temps pour les regrets
J'fais comme si c'était la dernière fois

Dois-je te faire confiance? Oui, mais pas aveuglément
Dois-je te donner mon amour? Oui, mais pas passionnément
Je me dois de sauter même s'il y a peu d'élan
Je dois faire l'effort d'utiliser ma haine à bon escient
Savoir ce que tu penses fait pas partie de mes ambitions
Je trouve le moyen d'avancer, avec ou sans biftons
Mes soucis augmentent comme ma contenance en pilon
Je suis bref quand je parle, mais mon silence en dit long
J'avance avec la discrétion d'un franc-maçon
Toujours une sortie de secours dans mon plan d'action
Je lève mon majeur en l'air à toute tentation
De toute façon y a pas cent façons de dire: ""Sans façon""

Ils me regardent bizarre, j'rentre pas dans leur registre
Mes bracelets font les ambiances quand j'enregistre
J'suis un Saiyan, je m'entraîne à la salle
Ca va être salé, j'vais découper des Saibaimans
Comme les triades, je m'adresse avec une balle
Rien ne m'arrête comme Riyad Mahrez, hé
Ou un raz de marée, le Real Madrid
Une vraie équipe comme ma réelle patrie
Le regard des gens importe peu, pas pour te plaire
J'ouvre pas ma porte à n'importe qui
C'est la pénurie avant l'palace
Y'a que dans l'dico qu'la réussite vient avant le travail

Même si tout a changé je suis resté le même

Sans mon passé j'serais pas qui je suis
Pour avancer faut pas qu'ils me suivent
Pas de défaite, juste de l'expérience
J'parle pas de casser des têtes, est-ce que tu me suis?
Ma vie a changé mais j'reste qui je suis
Toujours le même, on est corrosifs
Corrosif comme le fond d'Four Roses
T'façon les frelos suivent
Quand viennent les porcs en civ'
Tout ce chemin parcouru té-ma j'me suis pas reconnu
Dans le regard des gens
Tout ce chemin parcouru té-ma j'me suis pas reconnu
Dans le regard des gens

Le regard des gens s'est agencé
Je te vois niquer tes potos, pour être large en sapes
Tu dis que tu fais ça pour ta mère, menteur
Elle préfère être pauvre qu'avoir de l'argent sale
Tout pour mon clan, j'aimerais te dire qu'on est en place
Quel est ton plan? N'oublie pas que le temps passe
Les gars de ma de-ban vont péter des canettes en bas
Tellement d'fumée qui sort de la caisse
Que ton posse pense qu'elle est en panne
Si t'avait le moindre doute dans ton esprit
Les yeux rouges de ma troupe l'anéantirait
Fumée blanche qui sort de leurs bouches quand ils respirent
Ici on est toute l'année en hiver

Même si tout a changé je suis resté le même

Wie fängt man einfach so von vorne an

Es ist vorbei und hört niemals auf

Ohne Ende, und nicht soweit von Dir
Ohne Ende, ich wünsch mir du wärst hier
Ich wünsch mir das ich stark und schwach bin

Es ist geheim, der Große Büffel hat nämlich
Die Sonntagshose zerrissen

Das ist lange her

Und dann wolltest du weg
Wolltest einfach abhau’n mitten in der Nacht
Und hast mir dein Radio vermacht
Doch nach zwei Tagen warst du wieder da, müde und bleich
Es hatte nämlich leider nicht bis Kanada gereicht

Und du sagtest: Als mich die Bullen erwischten
War ich immerhin schon
Kurz vor Frankreich an der Autobahnausfahrt von Heilbronn

Das ist lange her
Heute gibt es keine Indiander mehr

Und in diesem Sommer erklärtest du mir
Was zwischen Jungs und Mädchen passiert
Und dann passierte es mit uns
Und ich dachte, die Welt vibriert

Und ein halbes Jahr später
War unser Leben wie ‘ne lange Explosion
Aus Musik und Farben und Reisen
Und wir flogen in weiten Kreisen davon

Irgendwann schenkte ich
Meine ganzen Indianerkleider einfach her
Als jemand sagte: Ich hab’ gehört
Der Grosse Büffel geht zur Bundeswehr

In der Zeitung heute Morgen habe ich dein Bild gesehen
Und ich schlug sie zu, ich wollte den Text nicht lesen
Wollt’ nicht wissen, bist du jetzt vielleicht berühmt oder tot
Oder Beides, das heißt: Eins davon gewesen

Und draußen knallen Kinder mit dem Colt
Und sie legen eine Oma um für eine Handvoll Gold

Nena,"Kinder sind Seelen,
Die spürn, wofür wir längst schon stumpf sind
Sie zeigen ihre Gefühle und schämen sich nicht

Kinder sind Augen,
Die sehn, wofür wir längst schon blind sind
Sie zeigen uns von den Dingen das andre Gesicht

Überall ist Wunderland,
Jeder kann es sehn
Und noch einmal unter dem Regenbogen stehn
Überall ist Wunderland,
Jeder darf hinein,
Und man sagt, ein Kinderherz kann der Schlüssel sein

Kinder sind Ohren,
Die hörn, wofür wir längst schon taub sind
Sie geben Tönen und Worten ein neues Gewicht

Überall ist Wunderland

Die zeigen, was wir gern verbergen
Sie sagen uns, wer wir sind
Ob wir’s woll'n oder nicht

Ich will Nirgendwo sein
Ich bin hier und vertraue
Schliess mich nie wieder ein
Ich will Nirgendwo hin
Ich will Nirgendwo sein
Meine Räder stehen still
Meine Wunden verheilen",Im Reich Meiner Mitte,2012
Nena,"Das ist nicht alles

Ich halt mich wieder mal auf
Setz mir einen Stein auf mein Glück
Steh mir selber im Weg
Und halt mich wieder zurück
Ich steck in meinem Muster
Und fühl mich wie aus Beton
Angst und Schuldgefühl sind
Eine schlechte Kombination

Das ist nicht alles
Das kann nicht alles sein

Wann und wo und wie ist mir egal
Das ist nicht alles das kann nicht alles sein
Und leben tue ich nicht zum ersten Mal
Das ist nicht wahr das kann nicht alles sein
Ich glaub an dich und unser Potential
Das ist nicht wahr das kann nicht alles sein

Immer der gleiche Konflikt
Immer die gleichen Themen
Wie du mir so ich dir
Ich will was neues leben
Ich bin ein Biophoton
Bau mir ne Lichtgallerie
Stimm mich ein auf mein Sein
Und schwing auf Herzenergie

Das kann nicht alles sein

Wann und wo und wie ist mir egal
Das ist nicht alles das kann nicht alles sein
Und leben tue ich nicht zum ersten Mal
Das ist nicht wahr das kann nicht alles sein
Ich glaub an dich und unser Potential
Die Welt wird anders die Welt wird anders sein
Entfaltet sich und trägt uns raus ins All
Und es wird wahr die Welt wird anders sein",Das Ist Nicht Alles,2012

Wecker schreit
Erster Flash
Keine Zeit
Auf geht’s
Nacht is weg
Konkurrenz
Im Gepäck
Lauf lauf
Um den Sieg
Mit den Andern
In den Krieg
Aufstieg
Untergang
Pass mal auf
Du lässt dich fangen

Ich steh mit dir im selben Nebel
Ich steh mit dir im selben Licht

Wir sind irgendwie verrückt

Ich geh schonmal voraus
Ich such schonmal das Weite
Und wer passt auf mich auf
Lass mich nicht alleine

System
So bequem
Alles klar
Angenehm
Wo ist der Garten
Auf deinem Dach
Hältst den Ball
Viel zu flach
Es brennt
In jeder Stadt
Menschen tot
Alle satt
Wach auf
Wecker schreit
5 vor 12
Es ist soweit

Ich steh mit dir im selben Nebel
Ich steh mit dir im selben Licht

Wir sind irgendwie verrückt

Ich geh schonmal voraus
Ich such schonmal das Weite
Und wer passt auf mich auf
Lass mich nicht alleine

Du bist gut ich glaub an dich
Du bist gut vergiss das nicht

Ich geh schonmal voraus
Ich such schonmal das Weite
Und wer passt auf mich auf
Lass mich nich alleine",Lied Nummer Eins,2012
Nena,"Schmetterling schwing deine Flügel
Lass mich deine Schönheit sehen
So lange es geht

Eine Frau wiegt sanft ihr Kind
Und der Wind singt leise mit
Wie zärtlich sie sind

Meeresgrund zeig mir die Tiefe
Die uns Gott geschaffen hat
In all ihrer Pracht

Hör die Stimmen
Die uns leiten
Die uns führen
Und stets begleiten

An die Könige der Welt
Unsere Völker haben gewählt
Ohne Angst und ohne Waffen
Werden wir Bewusstsein schaffen
Alle Träume werden wahr
Das Paradies war immer da
Wer die Wahrheit nicht erkennt
Hat gnadenlos verschlafen

Kleine Blume wie ein Wunder
Stehst du da und liebst dich selbst
Wie einfach das ist

Großer Fluss erzähl vom Wasser
Wie es lebt und durch mich fließt
Wie herrlich du bist

Hör die Stimmen
Die uns leiten
DIe uns führen
Und stets begleiten

An die Könige der Welt
Unsere Völker haben gewählt
Ohne Angst und ohne Waffen
Werden wir Bewusstsein schaffen
Alle Träume werden wahr
Das Paradies war immer da
Wer die Wahrheit nicht erkennt
Hat gnadenlos verschlafen

Und wir werden wieder Kinder
So wie es geschrieben steht

Schmetterling schwing deine Flügel
So lange es geht",Schmetterling,2012
Nena,"Du guckst mich an, und ich geh mit
Und der ist ewig, dieser Augenblick
Da scheint die Sonne, da lacht das Leben
Da geht mein Herz auf, ich will’s dir geben
Ich will dich tragen, ich will dich lieben
Denn die Liebe, ist geblieben
Hat nicht gefragt, ist einfach da
Weglaufen geht nicht, das ist mir klar

Du und ich das ist ganz sicher
Wie ein schöner tiefer Rausch
Von der ganz besond’ren Sorte
Und wir ham ein Recht darauf
Uns immer wieder zu begegnen
Immer wieder anzusehen
Wenn die große weite Welt ruft
Werd ich sicher mit dir gehen

Liebe will nicht
Liebe kämpft nicht
Liebe wird nicht
Liebe ist
Liebe sucht nicht
Liebe fragt nicht
Liebe ist, so wie du bist

Gute Nacht, mein Wunderschöner
Und ich möcht mich noch bedanken
Was du getan hast, was du gesagt hast
Es war ganz sicher nicht leicht für dich
Du denkst an mich, in voller Liebe
Und was du siehst, geht nur nach vorne
Du bist mutig, du bist schlau
Und ich werd’ immer für dich da sein
Das weiß ich ganz genau

Du und ich wir sind wie Kinder
Die sich lieben wie sie sind
Die nicht lügen und nicht fragen
Wenn es nichts zu fragen gibt
Wir sind zwei und wir sind eins
Und wir sehn die Dinge klar
Und wenn einer von uns gehen muss
Sind wir trotzdem immer da

Wir sind da, wir sind da, wir sind da
Wir sind da, wir sind da, wir sind da

Liebe will nicht
Liebe kämpft nicht
Liebe wird nicht
Liebe ist
Liebe sucht nicht
Liebe fragt nicht
Liebe fühlt sich, an wie du bist

Liebe soll nicht
Liebe kämpft nicht
Liebe wird nicht
Liebe ist
Liebe sucht nicht
Liebe fragt nicht
Liebe ist, so wie du bist
So wie du bist, so wie du bist","Liebe ist [Live im Studio, Hamburg] [Live]",2012
Nena,"Heute Morgen bin ich komisch aufgewacht
Ich hab mir Sorgen gemacht
Kann es sein, dass wir uns nicht mehr kennen
Kann es sein, dass wir uns nicht mehr lieben
Kann es sein, dass wir uns gar nicht ändern
Kann es sein, dass wir uns auch belügen
Ich hab keine Ahnung, ich weiß nicht Bescheid
Ich will bei dir bleiben, manches tut mir leid

Es gibt viele Gründe um zu Weinen
Es gibt noch viel mehr Gründe mich zu freuen
Jeder Tag mit dir ist die Erfahrung
Alles was ich bin mit dir zu teilen
Es gibt nichts zu Schaffen und zu Ändern
Es gibt nur wie du bist und wie ich bin
Und dass wir unser Glück nicht mehr verhindern
Und unterwegs das Lachen nicht verlieren

Ich hab kein Recht zu klagen
Das macht auch keinen Sinn
Doch ich darfs dir sagen
Wenn ich traurig bin
Und wir gehen Hand in Hand
Und wir wandern auch durch den Regen
Übers Wasser in ein neues Land
Gehen wir uns entgegen

Ich lass alles unter mir und schwebe
Und guck mir dich und mich von oben an
Und merke dass ich wieder gerne lebe
Weil ich mein Leben mit dir teilen kann",Neues Land [Live in Berlin] [Live],2012
