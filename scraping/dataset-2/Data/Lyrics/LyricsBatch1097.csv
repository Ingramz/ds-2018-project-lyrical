The Bellamy Brothers,"I beg your pardon
I never promised you a rose garden
Along with the sunshine
There's gotta be a little rain some time
When you take you gotta give so live and let live
Or let go oh-whoa-whoa-whoa
I beg your pardon
I never promised you a rose garden

I could promise you things like big diamond rings
But you don't find roses growin' on stalks of clover
So you better think it over
Well if sweet-talkin' you could make it come true
I would give you the world right now on a silver platter
But what would it matter
So smile for a while and let's be jolly
Love shouldn't be so melancholy
Come along and share the good times while we can

I beg your pardon
I never promised you a rose garden
Along with the sunshine
There's gotta be a little rain some time

I beg your pardon
I never promised you a rose garden

I could sing you a tune and promise you the moon
But if that's what it takes to hold you
I'd just as soon let you go
But there's one thing I want you to know
You better look before you leap, still waters run deep
And there won't always be someone there to pull you out
And you know what I'm talkin' about
So smile for a while and let's be jolly
Love shouldn't be so melancholy
Come along and share the good times while we can

I beg your pardon
I never promised you a rose garden
Along with the sunshine
There's gotta be a little rain some time,
I beg your pardon
I never promised you a rose garden",I Never Promised You a Rose Garden,2006
The Bellamy Brothers,"I knew a man, Bojangles and he danced for you
In worn out shoes
Silver hair, a ragged shirt and baggy pants
The old soft shoe
He jumped so high
He jumped so high
Then he'd lightly touch down
I met him in a cell in New Orleans, I was
Down and out
He looked to me to be the eyes of age
As he spoke right out
He talked of life
He talked of life
He laughed, clicked his heels and stepped
He said his name, Bojangles and he danced a lick
Across the cell
He grabbed his pants, a better stance
Oh, he jumped so high
Then he clicked his heels
He let go a laugh
He let go a laugh
Pushed back his clothes all around
Mr. Bojangles
Mr. Bojangles
Mr. Bojangles
Dance
He danced for those in minstrel shows and county fairs
Throughout the south
He spoke with tears of fifteen years how his dog and him
Traveled about
The dog up and died
He up and died
After twenty years he still grieves
He said I dance now at every chance in honky tonks
For drinks and tips
But most the time I spend behind these county bars
He said I drinks a bit
He shook his head
And as he shook his head
I heard someone ask him please
Please

The Bellamy Brothers,"Hey George, did you know Waylon and Willie?
The outlaws, I didn't know that at all
Did you know roger was king of the road?
You got it possum

Everyone knows hank's been in prison
We didn't know that
And dolly's got two big reasons she's well known

They call me no show Jones
They call me no show Jones
Still I'm never on
Still never on
Instead of just singin' my songs, my whereabouts are unknown
They call me no show Jones
They call me no show Jones

Here's ? Loretta is ? daughter
Ah, she's mighty pretty son
Johnny wears black, his tans all along
Boy, that's lonesome

Everyone knows Kenny is a gambler
I didn't know that at all
About Tammy
Tammy had some kind excuse, she divorced George Jones

They call me no show, they call me no show Jones
I'm still never on
I'm still never on
Instead of just singin' my songs, my whereabouts are unknown

The Bellamy Brothers,"You tell me how she was when you once knew her
She played her games with many, many men
You tell me that you don't think I'd be with her
If I could have known her back then
You ask me why I don't pack up and leave her
Now that I know her wicked ways
Well, I doubt that you could understand my thinking
But listen close to what I have to say

(Chorus:)
She's the rock that I lean on
She's the sunshine of my day
I don't care what you say about her
She took me in and made me everything I am today

she's my rock and I ain't gonna throw her away
I know she wasn't always what she is now
She had to make mistakes like everybody else
And don't you point you finger at nobody
It?s plain to see you ain't no saint yourself

(Repeat chorus)



",She's My Rock,2006
The Bellamy Brothers,"It's always cold when she's away
Ain't no sunshine when she's gone
She's always gone too long
Any time she goes away

Ain't no sunshine when she's gone
In this house just ain't my home
Any time she goes away

I know
Yeah, I know 
I know 
I will leave your things alone
There ain't no sunshine when she's gone
Ain't no sunshine when she's gone
Only darkness every day 

Ain't no sunshine when she's gone
In this house just ain't my home
Any time she goes away
Any time she goes away

I wonder this time where she's gone
I wonder if she's gone to stay

I leave your things alone 
But there ain't no sunshine when she's gone

The Bellamy Brothers,"Oh when the sun beats down
And burns the tar on the roof
And your shoes get so hot
You wish your tired feet were fireproof

Under the Boardwalk
Down by the sea
On a blanket with my boyfriend's where I'll be

Under the Boardwalk, out of the sun
Under the Boardwalk, we'll be having some fun
Under the Boardwalk, people walking above
Under the Boardwalk, we'll be making love
Under the Boardwalk, Boardwalk

From the park you hear the happy sound
Of the carousel
You can almost taste the hot dogs
And french fries they sell

Under the Boardwalk
Down by the sea
On a blanket with my boyfriend's where I'll be

Under the Boardwalk, out of the sun
Under the Boardwalk, we'll be having some fun

The Bellamy Brothers,"Some glad morning when this life is over
I'll fly away
To a home on God's celestial shore
I'll fly away

I'll fly away, o glory
I'll fly away (in the morning)
When I die, hallelujah, bye and bye
I'll fly away

Just a few more weary days and then
I'll fly away
To a land where joy shall never end
I'll fly away

I'll fly away, o glory
I'll fly away (in the morning)
When I die, hallelujah, bye and bye

The Bellamy Brothers,"He turned thirty-five last Sunday*
In his hair he found some gray 
But he still ain't changed his lifestyle 
He likes it better the old way 
So he grows a little garden in the back yard by the fence 
He's consuming what he's growing nowadays in self defense 
He get's out there in the twilight zone 
Sometimes when it just don't make no sense 

He gets off on country music 
'Cause disco left him cold 
He's got young friends into new wave 
But he's just too friggin' old
And he dreams at night of Woodstock and the day John Lennon died 
How the music made him happy and the silence made him cry 
Yeah he thinks of John sometimes 
And he has to wonder why

He's an old hippie and he don't know what to do 
Should he hang on to the old 
Should he grab on to the new 
He's an old hippie...his new life is just a bust 
He ain't trying to change nobody 
He's just trying real hard to adjust 

He was sure back in the sixties that everyone was hip 
Then they sent him off to Vietnam on his senior trip 
And they forced him to become a man while he was still a boy 
And in each wave of tragedy he waited for the joy 
Now this world may change around him 
But he just can't change no more 

He's an old hippie and he don't know what to do 
Should he hang on to the old 
Should he grab on to the new 
He's an old hippie...his new life is just a bust 
He ain't trying to change nobody 
He's just trying real hard to adjust 

Well, he stays away a lot now from the parties and the clubs 
And he's thinking while he's joggin' 'round 
Sure is glad he quit the hard drugs 
'Cause him and his kind get more endangered everyday 
And pretty soon the species will just up and fade away 
Like the smoke from that torpedo...just up and fade away 

He's an old hippie and he don't know what to do 
Should he hang on to the old 
Should he grab on to the new 
He's an old hippie...his new life is just a bust 
He ain't trying to change nobody 
He's just trying real hard to adjust",Old Hippie III (Saved),2007
The Bellamy Brothers,"While I'm far away from you my baby
I know it's hard for you my baby
Because it's hard for me my baby
And the darkest hour is just before dawn
Each night before you go to bed my baby
Whisper a little prayer for me my baby
And tell all the stars above
This is dedicated to the one I love
(love can never be exactly like we want it to be)
I could be satisfied knowing you love me
(and there's one thing I want you to do
especially for me)
And it's something that everybody needs
While I'm far away from you my baby

The Bellamy Brothers,"Back down memory lane, I began as my mother's bright idea
A short time later they all watched in awe and all of a sudden I'm here
She was also my father so I hardly got to see her
I was afraid of the dark, but it was only 'cause I was a believer

I was told when I was two years old
She swore that I would be special
I took a good look around and thought
Don't worry mama this city's gonna help ya

Georgia, you'll always be home to me
Georgia, I belong to you and yes you belong to me
When they ask me where I'm from
I'm proud to say that I'm your son

I'm movin' on using mostly dirt roads until I find my way
Campbellton Road, can't forget Cascade or remember both MLK
There's somethin' about Atlanta, doesn't cease to amaze me
Oh, after all you even raised the people that raised me

And my old man is very dead, can't be mad now why bother?
And you have been my mother nature also my godfather

Georgia, you'll always be home to me
Georgia, I belong to you and yes you belong to me
When they ask me where I'm from
I'm proud to say that I'm your son
Georgia, you'll always be home to me

The Bellamy Brothers,"Well it seems like more and more were being stifled.
All them colorful words I once used are wrong
So before we lose our free speech and our rifles
Allow me to elaborate in this song

Life ain't like a bowl of cherries,
There's too little laughter and too much sorrow.
It's more like a jar of jalapenos,
Cause what you do and say today, It don't go away and stay
It'll just come back and burn your ass tomorrow.

I've heard them politicians empty promises.
All their views just put mine to the test
They put me down for thinkin bout girls and singin bout Jesus
Hey I'm just a heterosexual white boy Methodist

Life ain't like a bowl of cherries,
There's too little laughter and too much sorrow.
It's more like a jar of jalapenos,
Cause what you do and say today, It don't go away and stay.
It'll just come back and burn your ass tomorrow

Now there's a complicated question
on the worlds most brilliant minds.
It's being asked by every body from Obama, to Glenn Beck.
They all want to know why there's a warning,
on them little blue pills
When there aint no such thing as being too direct,
Oh, what the heck.

Life ain't like a bowl of cherries,
There's too little laughter and too much sorrow.
It's more like a jar of jalapenos.
Cause what you do and say today, It don't go away and stay
It'll just come back and burn your ass tomorrow.
Cause what you do and say today, It don't go away and stay
It'll just come back and burn your ass tomorrow.
That's right, ask Bill Clinton, John Edwards, Tiger Woods and Bernie Madov.",Jalapenos,2010

The Bellamy Brothers,"Baby when I met you there was peace unknown
I set out to get you with a fine tooth comb
I was soft inside there was something going on

You do something to me that I can't explain
Hold me closer and I feel no pain every beat of my heart
We got something going on

All this love we feel needs no conversation

Sail away with me to another world

Everything is nothing if you got no one
And you did walk in the night
Slowly losin' sight of the real thing

But that won't happen to us and we got no doubt
Too deep in love and we got no way out
And the message is clear this could be the year for the real thing

No more will you cry, baby I will hurt you never

The Belle Brigade,"In death, you face life with a child and a wife
Who sleep-walks through your dreams into walls.
You're a soldier of mercy, you're cold and you curse,
""He who cannot be trusted must fall.""

Loneliness, tenderness, high society, notoriety.
You fight for the throne and you travel alone
Unknown as you slowly sink
And there's no time to think.

In the Federal City you been blown and shown pity,
In secret, for pieces of change.
The empress attracts you but oppression distracts you
And it makes you feel violent and strange.

Memory, ecstasy, tyranny, hypocrisy
Betrayed by a kiss on a cool night of bliss
In the valley of the missing link
And you have no time to think.

Judges will haunt you, the country priestess will want you
Her worst is better than best.
I've seen all these decoys through a set of deep turquoise eyes
And I feel so depressed.

China doll, alcohol, duality, mortality.
Mercury rules you and destiny fools you
Like the plague, with a dangerous wink
And there's no time to think.

Your conscience betrayed you when some tyrant waylaid you
Where the lion lies down with the lamb.
I'd have paid off the traitor and killed him much later
But that's just the way that I am.

Paradise, sacrifice, mortality, reality.
But the magician is quicker and his game
Is much thicker than blood and blacker than ink
And there's no time to think.

Anger and jealousy's all that he sells us,
He's content when you're under his thumb.
Madmen oppose him, but your kindness throws him
To survive it you play deaf and dumb.

Equality, liberty, humility, simplicity.
You glance through the mirror and there's eyes staring clear
At the back of your head as you drink
And there's no time to think.

Warlords of sorrow and queens of tomorrow
Will offer their heads for a prayer.
You can't find no salvation, you have no expectations
Anytime, anyplace, anywhere.

Mercury, gravity, nobility, humility.
You know you can't keep her and the water gets deeper
That is leading you onto the brink
But there's no time to think.

You've murdered your vanity, buried your sanity
For pleasure you must now resist.
Lovers obey you but they cannot sway you
They're not even sure you exist.

Socialism, hypnotism, patriotism, materialism.
Fools making laws for the breaking of jaws
And the sound of the keys as they clink
But there's no time to think.

The bridge that you travel on goes to the Babylon girl
With the rose in her hair.
Starlight in the East and you're finally released
You're stranded but with nothing to share.

Loyalty, unity, epitome, rigidity.
You turn around for one real last glimpse of Camille
'Neath the moon shinin' bloody and pink
And there's no time to think.

Bullets can harm you and death can disarm you
But no, you will not be deceived.
Stripped of all virtue as you crawl through the dirt,
You can give but you cannot receive.

Misplaced in the sand

At the moon in it's flight

In the still of the night
While the world lies in slumber
Oh the times without number
When I say to you

Do you love me
Just like I love you
Are you my life to be
That dream come true

Were once my own
My heart, how it yearns the flame still burns

So I will just pray and suffer all day
And say a lover's prayer

Some day your eyes will fill with tears
When you need me
You'll think it's too late, but my love will wait
Until eternity
Some times when I'm out and having fun
My tears disappear
But deep in my heart, you're the only one
Oh answer my lover's prayer

I don't want their sympathy
You go to parties, dances and shows
I still love you but no one knows

Maybe some how, some time, some where
You'll walk by and hear my prayer
My loneliness will fade away
Darling please tell me you'll stay

I'll be hurt but I won't cry
And though my love for you still grows
I feel it's better if no one knows",No One Knows,1992

Left knows what my right hand's for

But when I laugh, when I smile
I could leap tall buildings, run a mile
I laugh and then I smile

I have everything I need
Voice concern but I don't complain
Remember I've four mouths to feed

I'm much too headstrong for my own good.
I'm too involved to realize
That your uncertainty will be the death of me.
But I lose my will and if looks could kill,
I've been struck down dead by your beautiful eyes.
Chorus : Time after time you challenge me for a reason.
I know that I'm impossible and deceiving.
I see the signs, you're telling me that you're leaving.
Time after time...
Time after time...
These games of politics and romance, they're quite impossible to win.
I can't unfathom you;
One minute you love me or you say you do
And then I turn my back, I'm under attack,
I turn to hold you and you stick me for nothing.

And if I change to be the way you say you want me,
I'll only be the way I've always wanted to.
You know as well as I do...
You know as well as I do...

But I didn't like the way that I was feeling
It's like I'm in a film
But I spend most of my time looking at the ceiling

And I can't get over yesterday
How the trouble started, I was thinking
Well, I wouldn't have gone overboard
If someone would have told me, I'd start sinking

Took my heart and then you went away
Now I'm missing you already
I wish it was tomorrow, yesterday

And I'm missing you

But you and I are different
It's hard to turn an argument
Into some kind of international incident

But you've told me twenty times before
You'd leave me
But I chose to play ignorant

So you took my life apart
Now it feels my world has gone astray

And then you'd come right back to me today

Lil Flip the Leprechaun, Slim Thug the Boss Hogg
Fin to put it all in why'all face

I bought a new Lac and put it on chrome, without touching my stash
Like Lil Flip I can do that, Excursion candy blue tha?
Twenty two that, pounds of dro I done blew that
You should of knew that, the Slim Thug gon' shine
My ear rings cost a dime, I read Rolex Times
I'm top of the line, you can tell when I open my mouth
I bet nobody got mo' princess cut teeth, than the Boss
Open your mouth up you lost, I'm blinding these boys
I'm joining rocks in your blocks, in candy blue toys
Talking noise, 'cause I ain't old enough to drank
But I got mo' cash to last, than your daddy in the bank
I'm top rank, Slim Thug gon' talk the talk

We some paid young G's, with too much cash
Too much flow and do', talking too much trash ha

Too much money is what I got, like Scarface I rap a lot
S-Type Jag straight off the lot, believe me dog I'm really hot
I'm swanging four's and thinking thoed, banging hoes and changing clothes
Smoking dro and doing shows, paper stack can never fold
I bought the car and I bought the house, I represent the Dirty South
Got more syrup than Waffle House, run through hoes like Marshall Faulk
I talk the talk and walk the walk, 'cause nigga I'm a G
Lil Flip is who I be, I know your gal know me
'Cause I wear a Roley, that look like a snowman
And I push a Jag, you just gotta see it man
I'm sitting on Dubs, kinda like a blank tape
You see them rocks in my teeth, ain't none of em fake
Give me a break, you think I'm lying or something
I'm at the mall with your hoe, and she buying me something
I'm a young pimp, with a whole lot of cash
And why'all haters, why'all can kiss our ass

I got too much M-O-N-E-why
Anything I S-E-E, I be	-you-why
Pull a Bentley off the lot, and ran that thang in the wall
We throw Crys in the air laugh, and watch it fall
Watch me ball, as the Dub spin like a top
I got crunk when I stopped, and made my pop trunk wop
Girls bop, automatic cause I'm top of the line
I cut my beep past six, and I raise the top of your spine
I'ma shine, Sucka Free, Boss Hogg in a row
You can catch me fresh and braided, or rugged and fro
You see the Spre's on the car, I bet you my people like the rock
When girls see Tite, Flip and Slim they say... pulling cameras out
Damn I'm hot, when I hit the club I'm bound to line to the bar
And for the first hundred people, I'm insuring they car
Attracting your star, cause nigga my piece attracting your car
We got too much green, and that's real by far

enjoy the night, it's nice outside 
tell me all the things I'll never be 
make me laugh and make me smile 
tell the truth and kind of lie 
make me feel alive inside

and figure out what I was doing wrong

so maybe it wasn't bad to do 
you did what you had to do 
maybe I'll still see you around 
playing with my silly rock band 
in some empty room one night 
you might find out that you never really knew me 
by that time we'll both be someone else 
and ou won't know us from the last big thing that never 
was a big bang

Am I everything I'm meant to be
How can you breathe lien next to me
Airs so hard to find when you're with me

I'm leaving you behind
I'm going all alone
And this is what it's like to be on your own

I can't see this time
Stars have left your eyes
Falling down to words that I left behind

It's not me this time
I'm not in your sky
Only difference is that I don't mind

How can I see without you guiding me
To point my life where I'm supposed to be
Where will I be where you can set me free
Those eyes they lie but they don't lie to me

I'm leaving you behind
I'm going all alone
And this is what it's like to be on your own

I can't see this time
Stars have left your eyes
Falling down to words that I left behind

It's not me this time
I'm not in your sky
Only difference is that I don't mind

How do I stop its been so bad
Maybe its time I can go back home
Good intentions only go so far

I trust my own rules and I trust my own way
Don't judge me by the way I feel
My thoughts are genuine my life is real
I don't know why I don't make a big deal
Sometimes I wish I could run away

When I wake up every morning
Every single day
The sun is still shining but my sky's still gray
And I don't know what to think
Everything that's been said and taught to me
Fades away like a somber symphony
And I don't know how to feel
I listen to what I've been told before,
But it doesn't seem to work anymore
And I don't know what to do

Sleepless nights and hopeless dreams
Out of reach is how things seem
And I don't know what to think
Another time, another place
Having thoughts I can't erase
And I don't know how to feel
Just hold on, I'll meet you there
It'll work this time I swear
And I don't know what to do

Until the day's not wasted anymore.
But motivation lacks temptation
And soon that void will disappear.
I waste my life at 3 am,
That's the only time when I'm awake.
The television is my best friend,
And the living knows that it will break,
It's just fate.
It's not that far and it won't be long,
Until the day's not wasted anymore.
But motivation lacks temptation
And soon that void will disappear.
Searching for the answers that I may never find,
There's nothing left for me to do,
So I'll just play Sweet Child O' Mine.
People act so different now,
The friends I used to have I know just fake it.
Maybe I'll come back someday,
Where everything will be just like I made it,
So I'll take it.
It's not that far and it won't be long,
Until the day's not wasted anymore.
But motivation lacks temptation
And soon that void will disappear.
Searching for the answers that I may never find,
There's nothing left for me to do,
So I'll just jump back in this life.
Searching for the answers that I may never find,
There's nothing left for me to do,
So I'll just end with this sweet bass line.

In blue rounded island

This is my life on the phone

Well I feel like Donald Duck
Sold my eyes for an once of luck
And now my backs on fire, my burning wire
The people upstairs don't scream so high

So I decided to fly off again and flew up really high
Away up on the crest out of sight
As I was taking off I was for the first time aware
That the people might see me taking off and land and fool around generally

I felt real numb ? everyone so I sat quite sad and sombre
I felt real numb ? everyone so I sat quite sad and sombre

Flying away from the site on the motorway
Quite high so we decided to head back
From the ticket office on the edge of the site
Said they couldn't make it for myself so we ain't gonna fly

In previous dreams I felt ?
But sometimes ? restrictions on my arms
And flap a little hands in the case of the dream
Didn't work so a superman dream
I couldn't do it in the superman style
So I tried flying off to Glasgow
Where I was flying somewhere in style on the M8
And I got caught more and more so I came lower and lower
So I don't think I wanna do couldn't fly anymore
Landed on the car where a women saw me
Suddenly appeared on the car but she couldn't carry anything
She walked down the street but she ?
I want small shop ?
In the shop was two small ?
Then I saw a porch bit
Suddenly I realised I was in someone's house
And I left and that's all I'm gonna be remembering for right now

I don't wanna see my friends
I don't wanna see my mad friend
Cause he's driving me insane
I don't wanna see my friends
I'm going totally round the bend
Earlier on today I tried to walk down the street
But my feet kept slipping on the pavement

I found myself at ninety degrees to the rest of the world
It's not much fun you take it from me
I'm not having too good a time
There's people worse off than me,
Don't think I don't realise that but
I'm going round the bend again the last thing I wanna do
Is see my friends again
I'm going quietly round the bend again

I try to function as a normal human being
I washed my car earlier on this evening
And now I'm trying to get it together
To cook a little meal
Before I go for a drink with my friends
But I got no food I got no time to go to the supermarket
It's not that I couldn't make time
It's more that I get confused when I get there
People walking past, see the green tray outside
They see a nice little flat imagine a person inside
He's having a great old time
Well I wish I was having a greater time
Than they could possibly imagine that I'm having
All I wanna do is go far away and see things I've never seen before
I like the pyramids they weren't built in a day y'know
? pyramids don't fit the equation

But I'm so paranoid I can't even make it to the supermarket
Let alone go to Egypt and see my favourite pyramid

I go round to Robin's and try and eat some food there
Sometimes its better if you're in the company of a man
He's just said he's had a glass of red wine
So why am I had mine
I listened to The Beach Boys just a minute ago, Wild Honey
It's not the best album but its still pretty good
They've got some funny little love songs on there
It's not really a Brian's production
So its probably not as good as something like Pet Sounds

Lyrics: 
The people asking questions to the people with the answers 
The people with the answers ire the people with the questions 
So the people with the questions asked the people with the answers 
The people with the answers won't tell the people with the questions the answers 

So the people with the questions they ask the people with the answers 
But the people with the answers won't speak to them 
Because the people with the answers give the people with the questions 
just a little bit too hard a time to speak to 

I'm a man who likes to be alone 
I'm a man who likes to think alone 
I don't have too many answers, but I got a whole heap of questions 
I got a whole heap of questions that I won't hide from you 

So low, don't smile you get high [?] 

So the people with the books they went and stood up on the mountain 
To get away from the people with no books 
The people with the books they started reading on the mountain but 
they couldn't see a thing because the sky went dark 
I don't know where the cloud cover came from 
I'm just sitting here rocking on the station 

I don't want to be the type of guy 
who lives alone, reading books, and never eats a pizza pie 
I don't want to be the type of person sitting alone with a book on my own 

With a book on my own 

The people with the questions got together 
with the people with the books and left the people with answers out 
So the people with the answers started to make their way over the hill 
to meet with people with the questions and the people with the books 

And we all live together on a little round ball 
We all sing together when the cuckoo calls 

I'm not the type best living alone 
Could we live together? Well, I don't know.. 

I'm not sitting here giving you a lesson 
So I?ll just keep my mouth shut for the next few minutes 

Can't keep quiet for long 
I'm a human being 
Can't help help singing this song 
I'm a human being 

You won't listen to me 
I'm not an authority 

So the people with the answers met the people with the questions 
and the people with the books sat down 
They finally decided to sit around to talk about their problems 
to see if they come up with some answers to meet the questions 
and some questions to meet the answers 

well, the leaves on the trees are green 
[ok we're agreed on that] 
and the roads are not very clean 
[ok we're agreed on that] 
and the food we eat is not very healthy 
[ok we're agreed on that] 
and the music we make is not particularily good 
[ok we're agreed on that] 
and the planets sort of revolve around the sun 
[ok we're agreed on that] 
and the moon is a big ball with nothing on it, and I don't think anyone's ever been there 
[ok, so we're kind of agreed to that, so what are we arguing about? 
Well, I don't know.. 
Ok. so let?s get together and smoke that pizza pie] 

Some people with a pizza pie made me very high 
The people with the questions smile 
And the people with the answers lie 
They lie 

So no pizza for them

I been along time comin down the mountainside 
You see I fell from a spaceship I was taken for a little ride 
And I'd very much like to fall in love with you

will you think of me when I'm gone? 

Sister live a long time I don't want to fight with you 
See my head's in a vice and I don't know who I am anymore

That's what I like to see
Got me on a Tuesday

Put me on a Wednesday

Married on a Thursday
Make another way
Swore me on Friday
She's gonna break your neck
Saturday comes around
She offed me on the deck
I thought I'd make it Sunday
But I didn't see it coming
And the stormies started humming
And my friends they started running

I only want to count the days
To say we made another day
Daytime seems to last so long
And that's for screaming live alone

We might just break can you see us crying
We might just break can you hear us trying

I find it very hard
To say what I see
What's going through her mind
When she's looking the me
If all the things I've said right now
For both of us came true
Nobody would look for me
When I disappear in you
And it's never very clear just who's in control
It's all so beautiful what's the point of it all

To say we made another day

I went to swim the ocean but I drowned up in the sea 
I want to love my woman but she chose him over me 
I want to be somebody else I feel I won't be free 
Is this me for life? 

I fought to keep from crying as I lay upon the floor 
And everyone I knew right then pressed me to the floor 
I tried to keep on breathing but the people would not give 
And all the evil in the world the people would not give 
Is this me for life?

with the guns and the disease and the industry of weasels 
Saying: sell to them the killing gem, attack to get it back

Her voice was far and faded
Reminding me how sudden she changed
And cut off her cascading

And seasons time may drown me

""We have come to fish for the herring fish
That live in this beatiful sea
Nets of silver and gold have we,""

Ruffled the waves of dew

That lived in the beautiful sea

Never afraid are we,""

But some folks thought 'twas a dream they'd dreamed
Of sailing the beautiful sea

The Big Apple Chorus,"Somewhere over the rainbow, way up high
There's a land that I've heard of once in a lullaby.
Somewhere over the rainbow, skies are blue
And the dreams that you dare to dream,
Really do come true.

Someday I'll wish upon a star
And wake up where the clouds are far behind me.
Where troubles melt like lemon drops,
High above the chimney tops,
That's where you'll find me.

Somewhere over the rainbow, blue birds fly
Birds fly over the rainbow
Why then, oh why can't I?
If happy little bluebirds fly beyond the rainbow
Why, oh why can't I?

Somewhere over the rainbow, way up high
There's a land that I've heard of once in a lullaby.

And wake up where the clouds are far behind me.

The Big Bad Horns,"Let me tell you 'bout this girl I know
She ain't nothing like any girl you've known before
'Cause everybody wants her
In her dress or her old blue jeans
When you see her you'll be coming apart at the seams
'Cause everybody wants her

She's got everything a man could ask for
She's animal and innocence
She could wrap you round her little finger
She's sharp as a knife, you ought to see her dance
Everybody wants her, they make it plain to see
Everybody needs her, she don't know it but she wants me

The first time that she passed my way
I got so nervous that I couldn't find a thing to say
'Cause everybody wants her
She's told so many guys to sling their hook
But I've been watching her eyes and I've seen her look
She knows everybody wants her

I'm never wrong with my intuition
I'm gonna say what I have to say
I got it worked out to the letter
I know I can make her see it my way

Everybody wants her, they make it plain to see
Everybody needs her, she don't know it but she wants me

That I can be trusted walkin' with you alone

It was there I found beside the Alamo
Enchantment strange as the blue up above
A moonlit pass that only she would know
Still hears my broken song of love
Moon in all your splendor know only my heart
Call back my rose, rose of San Antone
Lips so sweet and tender like petals falling apart
Speak once again of my love, my own.
Broken song, empty words I know
Still live in my heart all alone
For that moonlit pass by the Alamo
And Rose, my Rose of San Antone",San Antonio Rose,2003

Sailed off in a wooden shoe
Sailed on a river of crystal light
Into a sea of dew

""Now where are you going
And what do you wish?""
The old moon asked the three
""We have come to fish for the herring fish
That live in this beatiful sea
Nets of silver and gold have we,""
Said Wynken and Blynken and Nod

The old moon laughed and sang a song
As they rocked in the wooden shoe
And the wind that sped them all night long
Ruffled the waves of dew

Well the little stars where the herring fish
That lived in the beautiful sea
""Now cast your nets where ever you wish
Never afraid are we,""
So sang the stars to the fishermen three
Wynken and Blynken and Nod

All night long their nets they threw
To the stars in the twinkling foam
Then down from the skies came the wooden shoe
Bringing the fishermen home

'Twas all so pretty a sight it seemed
As if it could not be
But some folks thought 'twas a dream they'd dreamed
Of sailing the beautiful sea

And even the palms seem to be swaying

And there we are, swearing to love forever
And promising never, never to part

Till clouds came along to disperse the joys we had tasted
And now when I hear people curse the chance that was wasted
I know but too well what they mean

Let the love that was once a fire remain an ember
Let it sleep like the dead desire I only remember

He was lookin' for a soul to steal
He was in a bind
'Cause he was way behind
And he was willin' to make a deal

When he came upon this young man
Sawin' on a fiddle and playin' it hot
And the devil jumped
Up on a hickory stump
And said, ""boy, let me tell you what

I guess you didn't know it 
But I'm a fiddle player too 
And if you'd care to take a dare, I'll make a bet with you 

Now you play a pretty good fiddle, boy
But give the devil his due
I'll bet a fiddle of gold
Against your soul
'Cause I think I'm better than you""

The boy said, ""my name's Johnny
And it might be a sin
But I'll take your bet
And you're gonna regret
'Cause I'm the best there's ever been""

Johnny, rosin up your bow and play your fiddle hard 
'Cause hell's broke loose in Georgia, and the devil deals the cards 
And if you win, you get this shiny fiddle made of gold 
But if you lose, the devil gets your soul

The devil opened up his case
And he said, ""I'll start this show""
And fire flew from his fingertips
As he rosined up his bow

Then he pulled the bow across the strings
And it made an evil hiss
And a band of demons joined in
And it sounded something like this

When the devil finished
Johnny said, ""well, you're pretty good, old son
But sit down in that chair right there
And let me show you how it's done""

He played Fire on the Mountain run boys, run

Chicken in a bread pan pickin' out dough
Granny, does your dog bite? No child, no

Because he knew that he'd been beat
And he laid that golden fiddle
On the ground at Johnny's feet

If you ever want to try again
I done told you once you son of a bitch
I'm the best that's ever been""

The fall from a domestic disgrace

So unprofessional
You're not a friend, you're just a lover
Nothing exceptional, this is correctional

Reflect this kiss to wish us all goodnight

First day in a victim's chair
Every surface replaced can help to keep
You fair for a corrected gaze
Every feature displayed will match your crowd

A loss of innocence, one hand to wash the other
Be a perfectionist
You're nothing if you're just another
Something material, this isn't personal

Above thy deep and dreamless sleep the silent stars go by

While mortals sleep the angels keep their watch of wondering love
Oh morning stars together, proclaim thy holy birth.
And praises sing to God the king, and peace to men on earth.

And wandering's brother walked on through the night
With his hair in his face on a long splintered cut from the knife
Of GT
The rally man's patter ran on through the dawn
Until we said so long to his skull
Shrill yell
Shining brightly red rimmed and red lined with the time
Infused with the choice of the mind on ice skates scraping chunks
From the bells

Cut mouth bleeding razors
Forgetting the pain
Antiseptic remains cool, good buy
So you fly
To the cozy brown snow of the east
Gonna choose, choose again

Sacrificials remain make it hard to forget
Where you come from the stools of your eyes
Serve to realize fame
Choose again
And Rovermans' refrain of the sacrilege recluse
For the loss of a horse
With the bowels and a tail of a rat
Come again, choose to go

And if Epiphany's terror reduced you to shame
Have your head bobbed and weaved
Choose a side
To be on
And if the stone glances off
Split didactics in two
Leave the color of the mouse trails
Don't scream, try between
If you choose
If you choose, try to lose
For the loss of remain come and start
Start the game

Che che che, ka tah koh

Choose to choose, choose to go",Death March,2017

But in other ways
It makes it seem OK

To eat like a king, to poke fun at clergy

There's a passion in being alone A grace in a loveless time
There's no new cross, there's no new sign
only the sun and the changing tide

And out of respect, well really must confess
I never lost your number I never
lost your address
And if we remain friends at best
Sometime later no, no not yet
we'll smile and remember it like this

She put back the letter,one tear
falls like a feather and disappears
on this bar room floor
The gratuity included, you know
the letter concluded

And it rusted through
He had twenty-nine blackbirds
But only one flew
Spent most of his time making holes

She took her diamond rings and was
Gone before the light
She left one satin shoe and a
Very dull knife

Bending, A lie is the tool that you'll need

So I'm under a mountain
Stuck to this mattress
Perfume and Valium

What makes a Sunday different from Monday
Could be a look in her eyes
In need of flattery she changes batteries
So that her light will shine
The words she utters either so flows or
Stutters
They're either silly or wise
Anger with concern
But never to yearn
Only to be by your side

Lay down with number 13
Its a cold gray shame",Under a Mountain,1996

The Black Crowes,"Virgil Caine is my name, and I served on the Danville train
Til Stonewall's Calvery came and tore up the tracks again
In the winter of '65, we were hungry, just barely alive
By May the tenth, Richmond had fell,
it's a time I remember oh so well

[Chorus]
The night they drove old Dixie down, and the bells were ringin'
The night they drove old Dixie down, and the people were singin'
They went na na na na na na, na na na na na na na na

Back with my wife in Tennessee, when one day she said to me
""Virgil, quick come see, there goes Robert E. Lee""
Well I don't mind choppin' wood,
and I don't care if the money's no good
Ya take what ya need and ya leave the rest
They never should have taken the very best

[Chorus]

Like my father before me, I will work the land
Like my brother above me, I took a rebel stand
He was just eighteen, proud and brave,
til a Yankee laid him in his grave
I swear by the mud beneath my feet
You can't raise a Caine when he's in defeat

But you kiss good and I'd like to
See you tomorrow

Not a daughter
'Cause she'd be just like you
You know that would not do

I'm no builder, I'm no gardener
I sing some songs, have a friend
Who's a photographer
There ain't no other language
I know how to speak
Some like their water shallow
And I like mine deep
Tied to the bottom
With a noose around my feet

The clouds conspire
Above my head
I overheard them
Say I wish he was dead
Today the sunset
Burned my eyes
And in the next room I hear someone cry

I like to dress up like the jury
To eat like a king, to poke fun at clergy
To talk like dirt
To love yo like tar
But never fall in too fast
With my north star
While you pull your hair out
I buy the drinks at the bar

Saw some kind of new light

Bury me with a ruby ring

Make my haze blow away

Truth in a fable faith in a rhyme

Are you surprised by what we see?
Like the tables and the tides turn
On my bed the emperor worn

With the lost awe of true love in my eye
The wild frontier outlaws and thieves
To find me a mountain in the sky

There's gold in them hills
I heard the man cry
There's gold in them hills
For the taking
It's a one-way ticket down a river of lies
There's gold in them hills
If you make it

On the last day of spring
I first saw the sea
A poor boy with good luck on my side
Ready for riches
I rolled up my sleeve
And took my first step down my life

Had my wallet same old pocket
Sixteen dollars brand new shoes

Empty bottles sad turned daughters
What's a country boy to do

Tell dear mother that I miss her
But things are different now
There's nothing I can do
Your dark haired son is now long gone
Remember me
When you stare at the moon

I've broken my heart
Diamonds and gold
Through scandal through madness through cold
All I have left is this Grey in my beard
This mountain and the stories that I've told

My senses heighten to extremes

My heart beat ever increasing
The only sound aside from the wailing of the wind through the trees

I know no fear
Boundaries of mortal human flesh have abandoned me as I am renewed
I dreamt of such a mutation for countless winter nights
My essence became that of a beast
I gracefully cut through the forest
Free of my former husk
Unfettered by the hindrances of past

My purpose manifests, I am void of delusion
I am born into this wolven form in seek of human flesh

I will to feast upon the bones of the meek
The marrow of my enemies

To quench my maw with shreds of virgin flesh
To tear apart he who I once was
To rid the world of his feeble lies

Finding my way back home to stalk amongst the feeble mortals
In the clothing of a sheep
Envenomed, I am the blackest incarnation
The end of their disease

On my arrival, vengeance swings a heavy hand
Crushing the will of god

The fall of their existence
Extinction, the will of humanity
Forsaken by my hand

Oh weep, the angels shall be destroyed
As claws remove their wings
Jaws sodden in the purest blood
In the purest fucking blood I bathe!

This blackened hand shall reap
Shall reap insurmountable
Undying, cleaving the sickly hearts of mortals true
Earth falls as heaven shall
Crumbing as god has taken knee and felt his creation's pain
The humans' fucking pain

Our lord has birthed the perfect evil unto this fragile earth

Pounding your weathered backs

Driven by hunger for vengeance

The Black Dahlia Murder,"Amongst the perilous mists formed of the moon arising new
The creature set upon us like a plague

Waist deep we proceeded to be butchered in the fog
Strafing straight into the clutches of the beast that hell hath spawned

One by one did they scream dragged beneath the blanket of the mist
The mob is damned born to lose a sacrifice of human meat to lycanthropic bliss

The wolf simply can't resist
Shots erupt
The strongest men are lost
As panic claims this throng
Who will hunt
And who will be the skinned?
The elder evil wins where's our bravado now?
The drunk and dead begin to pile
In vain we laughed and cheered
This night that spells our end

Flashlights are dwindling down
By earthly gods we're disavowed
Plump sow apple in mouth
The wolfen's pending feast

Above the law, we declared now lucky if we're left above the ground
Comb the woods a child we seek so little did we men know 
That our end would there be found

I held my breath as we happened on the girl
Or should I say what was left
Father screams uncontrollably hes lost his sanity

Thirty one closed casket funerals
Victims of sheer disbelief

Thirty one sent to the slaughter to be
Without reprieve

Dragged below sight
Writhing in the haze
Like sitting ducks we are in moments to be splayed

Where's our militia now?
Our bravest men a mounting pile
To think we toasted rye
This night that spells our end

Above the law, we declared now lucky if we're left above the ground
Comb the woods a child we seek so little did we men know

Black Eyed Peas contain the rhyme with the potion
Got your emotion mingling with us
Any animosity now it's time to hush
Feel the fuckin' rush

[Chorus: Repeat x2]
Say what if you feelin' it (say what, say what)
I know you feelin' it (say what, say what)
Say what if you feelin' it (say what, say what)
I know you feelin' it (say what, say what)

Really y'all, here's how to be free
Just open your mind and relax with the Peas
Let us call our mellow crew, help you out to peep the ease
Like a thirty-five mile cruise, steady summer breeze
Run into your town, run into her town
Feelin' my sound spreadin' around
We spreadin' around like the plague
I got you movin' hips, necks and legs
I'm closed to the end
So push me, we magic like hocus
We be fallin' up like oh shit
Some shit, that you won't see
Some shit that you can't lose
Some shit that can only be down by you know who
Whatever double the w-I to the l-l
For owning the extraterre-es-tre-el-el
Rockin' you the cool-ass rhymes
The cool-ass rhymes, some cool-ass rhymes
Some cool-ass rhymes

[Chorus: Repeat x2]

My job is to mainly hypnotize
I'm a take over the charts and maneuver through the eyes
Visually on stage, the Peas, we multiply
While equaling the sums of only one try
First is my scarf that presented of the pile
Second adjust my bust that really sound fly
Third gain the zone, the washa has arrived
Fourth keep my mind and my song online
We purchasin' dues that remain state of mind
Equipped with all cultures, a piece of color blind
We keep it on the positive 'cause it is hard to find
Keep it on the positive 'cause it is hard to find

The Black Eyed Peas,"[Conversation]
Yo son, whatcha think about those Peas, though?
Yo, yo, I don't know, them dudes just be on stage, dancin' and stuff...
They on some old Las Vegas bullshit
They move too much, man
I can't take them fools seriously
I mean, they ain't talk about no 6-4, no Impalas
They ain't shootin' nobody (Shootin' nobody)
They ain't talkin' about clothes
You know what I'm saying?

Yo, my man, I got a plan to do it all (What kind of plan you got)
I got a plan that none of y'all ever
Talked about 'cause underground niggas don't be thinking
I'm going kinda nino like Lincoln
How can you make moves when you're always strapped under
I plan to read the scriptures, tell you more about the thunder
I wonder what really makes the world go round
Not thugs, 'cause thugs go 'round the brain of a brother's down
You be in it for a quick blink
But when you start to sink
You be deeper than you was
When you should've stop to think
About your consequence your actions don't make lots of sense
Brothers use the wicked life 'cause of lack of confidence
The devil jacked you for your sense now
You can't pay your rent and
That's no accident, you let us slip so we win
The rest of your development
You should've took time to prevent
The compiscation of your monument
Now ya, wash up, and a nobody
No one blame but your body
You livin' life, had thick and uneasy
You chose to be involved with no deals and crisis
In a hole 'cause of lust and greed
Your mind held captive and unable to exceed
Come out and follow the Peas, we give you what you need
We proceed to give you, what (What, what)

[Chorus]
A... [8x]
We givin' you what you want
(We give you what you want) -- [3x]
And you proce-e-e-e-e-e-e-ed
On fiendin' on what you need
(We give you what you need) -- [3x]

Yo, everybody's goal is to win
But others getting caught up within the line of commiting sins
And everybody seems to wanna rule
It's so ridicule we gotta find the right cure
We approach to penetrate equivalent and strong
To wash out individual with evil forms
Conquering battles in these fields of greed
Dark faces all around me makes it hard for me to see
Who's got my back and who will backstab
I'm ready for foes and hoes who tries to grab
My currency, if I ain't got none
The Crip to runs to the ones who got some
The war billows to those who makes action
The main caption is to bring satisfaction
If you like that contend you see
How you suppose to call yourself a real MC

So what's the definition of a true MC
(Someone who rocks swell and put my soul at ease)
Lyrics went entertaining capability
(Now that's the realest, see, all around 360 degrees)

I'm givin' you what you want, want
I'm givin' you what you want
Na-na-na-na-na-na-na

I'm givin' you what you want, want

[Chorus]

Hey, witness grief through startin' material
You are blinded by lights, had an ego ratio
God bless you with the gift of only show
Business but you a careless professional
Is where your failing will show
Over indos and end only cash flows
Makin' it big, but yet, you never know
You will pay in your dues bringin' on sorrow
Here today, easily gone tomorrow
Feel the pain and I never borrow
From another man, instead I'm making grand
Watch the Peas as we make a stand

Oh my goodness, I know you feel the vibration
Across the globe no matter your location
Ain't no difficulty or complication
Just as long my niggas in the celebration
Celebrated the musical liberation
The Peas then demonstrated the demonstration
And you will feel the flush of relaxation
I'm a wax these and then get heavy rotation
I got you in bliss and ain't no aggravation
When you bump us, we bring the stimulation
So hurry up and get your daily fixation
But make sure that it's handled, it's a moderation
One dose should bring you to a limitation
So put your back into it, baby, that's right, huh
I'm about to plug in some dedication
This goes out to my brothers and my coalition

Cause literally you be in the cemetery
I'm about to throw a shout-out to my peeps
Dedicated to the DJ's that pump it in their streets

Whip it good like DeVoe we whip it good

Rock it in your box or your hooptie-hoop
Bump it in your hot Beamer 850 coupe
Cause I'm a inform y'all on what to do
Hop in your ride and drive down in your avenue
It's bumpin' in your barbeque and your venue
At a journey, feelin' that ease, is why I sent you
Cause ain't no stoppin' this, stoppin' it

Any minute we'll be all over your box and video
Niggas wanna stop me and my amigos
But we still roll all over your acapella goes
Leave it or this one here like meteor
Your mediocre scene, you feel the roar
Vibration that's headed for your store
For a change, not bragging about close to more
Instead brain fusion, I lace you up confusion
Relax and feel the groove it's the solution

I call my baby to tell her I'm on my way
Call her 'til I pass we going out today
It was a beautiful Sunday
I had plans on going to watchin' the matinee
But as soon as I step to the door
She hit me with some stuff that I just couldn't ignore
That she had to up and leave
Cause I was a fool foolin' her on what she need
Check it, yo from my point of view it was kinda whack
She said even when we're reminiscing there's no bringing it back
And for her, it's really beyond that
Talkin' about she been through emotional combat

You were never around
And now, love won't wait

I figured it out these women there's no pleasin'
Yo, Will, I feel the pain, that you're going through
She got you stuck on a yam and she's splatting too
Plotting on leaving you, yo, are you feeling cool
And if you're not you can always hang with the crew

Packed her bags and went and upset you

She was like ""I'm leaving"" (Oh it's like that, now)

The time is now, we ain't got time to play
Hey, you, listen to what I got to say
Let's get together and form a parade
Just delete what you create over plates
Make sure it's measured the right way
With the right ingredients, construct more devient
Things to prosper for your brain to capture
Now what I'm after is to learn from all things
Building full swing, no strings
You got me thinking about things that I don't need to think about
You wanna change my appearance for the masters, scope me out
Undress me, then rearrange me
Yo I can't go for that (No...)

You gotta jump back, jump inside B.E.P music
Shake what your mama gave you, don't abuse

While we improvise, giving you time and sensation
Mastering the art of motivation

Really y'all, this shit is all out of whack
You can go out at night yet you won't come back
And this verse that I'm kickin' some might take it personal
And come out and get me, but worst of all
These rap fans are taking this shit serious
It ain't New York verse L.A.

Lucifer's got your little mind twisted
Cause God once gave you the meaning of life and you missed it
You've enlisted in the devil's books
Livin' the life of crooks and hoes and in such and such
All that shit, that don't mean much
You got one hand on your gat while your genitals are being touched
Livin' the life that's plush and glamorous
Drunk and high with your little soul's crushed
Don't you know that life is a mirage
I keep myself sober so my soul is camouflaged
If the devil cannot see me tell me how can he attack me
If he can't grasp a hold tell me how can he try to snatch me
I ain't talking about the white man, the black man or a Jew man
Cause the devil can exist in every human
Look how Biggie went out, and Tupac went out
And Martin, and Malcolm, and Kennedy, and Squeek
And Adam, and Rene, and so on, and so on...

We're currently located over the Los Angeles scene
While you see a lot of niggas perpetrating like they're kings
With this so-called God complex
But when I see they mind they only see checks
So let's get our heads together
Let's form a foul weather
Proclaim against perpetrators

Well said, Alligator
Our realm, no perpetrator
A society choose the elevator
Of success by identity cross-fader
Complex thinking they're really much greater
Plain raw, harness all, maybe rough radar
Tough enough to perpetrate, I talk to you later

But wait, what about that midget brains
Unable to see reality too unreal
I'm sealed with mind, body and soul
Connected together, we tougher than leather
We much more than you think we are
We are the product of our own environment repent
With equality, plus duality
And taken all kind of posibilities (...bilities)

Let it rhythmically grow

Once you become it everything will be infinite

With the full-force pressure, hard to measure

We built this bridge for the ones that use their mind

The Black Eyed Peas,"I know I'm not the only one that's filling the void
Creatively hip-hop is being destroyed
A lot of rappers really need to be unemployed
Because the topics that them talk about has got me annoyed
You see I heard it all before, there's no need to repeat it
The forms I vacated, might as well delete it
Put your program in and open a new file
You shoulda took your record advance and bought a style
We the only crew that came original
While a lot of other brothers just mimic the pile
The pile that's only designed for pop charts
That contradicts thought, that's the reason we brought
It back 'cause honestly it lacks
Talent and creativity, in fact
These are symptoms to somethin that's whack
And your system senseless to witness that
So, baby if you wanna, we gon' speak on it
We gon' tell the world why hip-hop is haunted
Money is a drug and emcees is on it
We gon' take it back to the days of Mantronix

Rich in that English that's broke as hell
That's why my niggas in the hood understand me so well

Used to walk, all over your ears
You hear the thump, this track pumps like, well order

We comin' through to take control of each zip code 
Bridgin' the gap from rap to calypso 
We gonna strike each city from 'Frisco 
Tokyo to back to San Luis Obispo 
As they invaded decedents of Amadeus 
Transmitted through your CD's, tapes and record players 
We the crusaders, attack like alligators 
Yo, we're known to elevate like escalators 
Yo, we comin' through to control your area 
Black Eyed Peas control your area 
Bringin' the vibe that create hysteria 
Whack MC's vacate your area 
We three deep, comin' out of yo' speaker 
I'm bustin' your woofer and tearin' through your tweeter 
Every rapper's talkin' 'bout killin' somebody 
But they ain't hip-hop to me (check it out)

It's the Black Eyed Peas shore climbin' up the Empire
State tower livin' is the mission desired
I see a lot of liars throw them in the ocean like fire
And they lyrics soundin' tired, repetitious and expired
Cool them down quick before they time get picked
I can't take 'em serious talkin' about bullshit
Got money and cars but, can't bullshit
And your lyrics are soundin' like, some doo doo shit
While I'm holdin' the mic tight, recite livin' insight
So we can all benefit from the artform
Man it took the culture to make dough
But forgot the main goal, almost lost the soul and got norm
'Cause everybody's talkin' 'bout, high profilin'
But it ain't hip-hop to me (why why why)
'Cause everybody's talkin' 'bout, high profilin'

Yeah, your style's dated and you ain't came out yet
Don't think you're fresh cause you're rockin' them outfits
I think you're lost, 'cause you don't know where your route is
Pick up the mic, put your money where your mouth is
I pick up the mic and put my lyrics where my mouth is
Hit your spirit, make you jump out them couches
Quick agility to slow-like slouches
With more bounce to the freak of def ounces

And we announce this, follow us to show you what the sound is
Primo and the Peas collaboratin like great
Ayo let's do this, let's do this, we show you who the crew is
Black Eyed Peas is like the rulers leavin' all you brothers clueless
Haters hate us if you wanna, we gon' speak on it
We gon' tell the world why hip-hop is haunted
Money is a drug and MC's is on it
We gon' take it back to the days of Soulsonic

This is the hip hip hip, the hop hop hop
We keep it keep it movin, non non stop

If you really need me just call my name
I'm hear all the time for you babe-ay

And if I could I'd give my girl the world, world
A world without a war could ?unfural?, ?fural?
Our love could stand the testament of time, time
Till death do us part is that line
I could be with her till my son is 99
The love I feel for her is unbearably unique
Being away from her, yo it makes me kinda weak
Its like being on the desert with nothin to drink

Nowhere to go gotta shake this anxiety

This is my version of it

Listen closely all I got a story to tell
Version of my ghetto when life felt for real
Some would call it hell, to me it was heaven
God gave me the grace amazing ways of living
How would you feel if you had to catch a meal
To live to eat to chill and
Havin' to pump the water out of the ground
The way we put it down utilizing what's around
Like land for farm and river for fish
Everyone help each other whenever they can

And this be what's going on
Man it feels good to be back at home (back at home)
It's been a decade and a journey all along
I was fourteen when I first left Philippines
Been away half my life and it felt like a dream
To be next to my mom with her home cooked meal
Man I felt complete, my emotions I feel
Now life has changed for me in the U.S.
But back at home man, life was a mess
I guess sometimes the life stresses get you down

You start yellin when I'm with my friends

You know I have to make them dividends (bull shit)

Man you can pick me out like food in between
Your two front teeth 'cause you be like in the streets

To the third part (what?) it's a trilogy

What you didn't know
Ay yo we bring the bumps
Bumps for your trunk and we making the funk-funk

[Chorus x2]

Yo we up again, listen up
It's the Peas with the sound
We's about the break out
Shake the whole Earth now
Bass down up and loud whenever we get...
Set it off in your town
Let ya know we all pound
Whoever you are we gonna make you do it
Whatever you do it just stop
And dance to this
This is the diggy-diggy-diggy-diggy rock-rock

The Black Eyed Peas,"[Chorus]
Shut up just shut up shut up
Shut it up just shut up shut up
Shut up just shut up shut up
Shut it up just shut up shut up
Shut up just shut up shut up...

We try to take it slow
But we still losing control and I'm crazy
Trying to be a lady
I think I'm going crazy

Girl me and you is just fine, you know
We wine and dine did them things 
That couples do when in love, you know
Walks on the beach and stuff, you know
Things that lovers say and do
I love you boo, I love you too
I miss you a lot, I miss you more
That's why I flew you out when we was on tour
But something got out of hand
You start yellin', while I was with friends
Even though I had legitimate reasons, bull shit
You know I have to make the dividends, bull shit
How could you turn private eyes
That's why you don't believe my lies and quick today
 
[Chorus]
 
Why does emotion have to move so fast
Love is progress if you can make it last
Why is it that you just lose control 
Every time you agree on takin' it slow
So why do things got to be so damn tough
‘Cause fools in lust could never get enough love
Showin' the love that you be givin'
Changing your livin' for another transition
But less submission tryin' to get you to listen
Being mad has become a tradition
You yell, I yell everybody yell
Got neighbors across the street sayin'
Who the hell, what the hell's goin' down
Too much of the bickering, killing the sound
 
[Chorus]
 
[Bridge]
Girl our love is dyin', why did you stop tryin'
I never been a quitta, but I do this for better
Believe me I will do betta
Let's forget the past and start this new plan
Why, 'cause it's the same old routine
And then next week I hear them scream
Girl I know you tired of the things I say
You're damn right 'cause I heard them 
Lame dame excuses just yesterday
That was a different thing, no it ain't
That was a different thing, no it ain't
That was a different thing
It was the same damn thing 
Same ass excuses, boy you useless
Whoa...
 
Shut up just shut up shut up...
No no no...
Don't go, now go, I don't know
Shut up just shut up shut up...
 
Stop the talkin' baby, or I start walkin' baby
Stop the talkin' baby, or I start walkin' baby...

Is that all there is...",[CD-Rom Track],2003
The Black Eyed Peas,"Whenever I say your name, whenever I call to mind your face
Whatever bread's in my mouth, whatever the sweetest wine that I taste
Whenever your memory feeds my soul, whatever got broken becomes whole
Whenever I'm filled with doubts that we will be together

Wherever I lay me down, wherever I put my head to sleep
Whenever I hurt and cry, whenever I got to lie awake and weep
Whenever I kneel to pray, whenever I need to find a way 
I'm calling out your name

Whenever those dark clouds hide the moon
Whenever this world has gotten so strange
I know that something's gonna change 
Something's gonna change

Whenever I hurt and cry, whenever I got to lie awake and weep 

Whenever I'm on the floor
Whatever it was that I believed before
Whenever I say your name, whenever I say it loud, I'm already praying
Whenever this world has got me down, whenever I shed a tear

Whenever the TV makes me mad, whenever I'm paralyzed with fear 
Whenever those dark clouds fill the sky, whenever I lose the reason why
Whenever I'm filled with doubts that we will be together
Whenever the sun refuse to shine, whenever the skies are pouring rain

Whatever I lost I thought was mine whenever I close my eyes in pain
Whenever I kneel to pray, whenever I need to find a way
I'm calling out your name
Whenever this dark begins to fall

Whenever I'm vulnerable and small
Whenever I feel like I could die
Whenever I'm holding back the tears that I cry 
Whenever I say your name, whenever I call to mind your face

I'm already praying
Whatever bread's in my mouth, whatever the sweetest wine that I taste
Wherever I lay me down, wherever I rest my weary head to sleep
Whenever I hurt and cry, whenever I'm forced to lie awake and have to weep 

Whenever I'm on the floor
Whatever it was that I believed before
Whenever I say your name, whenever I say it loud, I'm already praying
Whenever I say your name,

Dominant and earth then back to Sydney

Let's make your mommas proud 2X
Let's do this for the people
Let's do, let's do it now

Back in a day when I was a teenager
Before I had status in a true way pager
You go find witness in a two trap conquest
They'll know it everywhere we wanna do this

You see, you gotta understand that things going cycle
Justin Timberlake is just a new form of Michael
It's cold inspiration, that's the way it be
Without a Jay Z's are probably wouldn't be no Peas

So wanna do this for those that inspired me to be
And multi faded me, to store my legacy 
I give a shut up to my man Ezze E
A big R.I.P, cause he believed in me

He put me down back in 1993
And now I grab mic and rock the party
I got Joys and Cheers for Pea by ease
Pea by ease short for family, they are people

Let's do this for the people
Let's make your mommas proud 2X

Praise with a key let me blow this track
I gotta pay homes to my P. Way back
How will Lil' Kim are huntin' the rap game
And now the dreams are same, but the game is changed

Back in '88 before first grade
I used to battle on the block as a people on break (yeah)
And heavy woman puss I use to wash the bush 
Use to leave Kung Fu down in Rock n Bloom 

Hip Hop (?) not the key belong 
Or less then saying unity over the bar
You want the spot when my mic is on
I was a good life foundation filling was fun

I can't go on, so I don?t get left behind
I can't go on, so I don?t get forgot my time
I can't go on, so I could just bless your mind
I can't go on, for the people busting my rhyme

Free styling in the sub for exercising the mind
Just cooling with my crib brand new be arise
B.Boy and then braking and try be on a nation

Digging in a placement with DJ More inpatient 
Live and direct Kono radio station
Rockin' with a fan do it short for fez
Mic in my hand, standing in my B-Boy stand

Whoever thought that the peas will spread like a disease 
And affect a whole blow, with a poster's soul
This is for the people that loves the P sound
We still make the music we're holding it down

This is dedicated to the Poll crush
If it wasn't for yo, then wouldn't be us

Uh huh
La da da da da 

Sorry sorry sorry sorry
Hey, baby my nose is getting big 
I noticed it be growing when I been telling them fibs 
Now you say your trust's gettin' weaker 
Probably 'cos my lies just started gettin' deeper 
And the reason for my confession is that I learn my lesson 
And I really think you have to know the truuth 
Because I lied and I cheated and I lied a little more 
But after I did it I don't know what I did it for 
I admit that I have been a little immature 
Fucking with your heart like I was the pre-da-tor 
In my book of lies I was the editor 
And the author 
I forged my signature 
And now I apologize for what I did to ya 
'Cos what you did to me I did to you 

[Chorus]
Nononono baby, nononono don't lie 
Nononono, yeah you kno kno kno know you gotta try 
What you gonna do when it all comes out 
When I see you & what you're all about 
Nonono babe, nononono don't lie
Yeah you kno kno kno know you gotta try 

She said I'm leaving 
'Cos she can't take the pain 
It's hard to continue this love it ain't the same 
Can't forget the things that I've done inside her brain 
Too many lies committed too many games 
She feeling like a fool getting on the last train 
Tryin' to maintain but the feeling won't change 
I'm sorry for the things that I've done and what I became 
Caught up in living my life in the fast lane 
Blinded by lights, cameras, you know the fame 
I don't know the reason why I did these things 

And I lie and I lie 
And I lie and I lie

And now our emotions are drained 
'Cos I lie and I lie and a little lie lie 
And now your emotions are drained 

[Chorus]

Ooh ooh ooh ooh, ooh ooh ooh 
Ba da ba da ba da ba da badabada 

Yo, I'm lying to my girl 
Even though I love her 
And she all in my world 
I give her all my attention and diamonds & pearls 
She's the one who makes me feel on top of the world 
Still I lie to my girl, I do it 

And I lie and I lie and I lie 'til there's no turning back 
I don't know why, and I lie and I lie 'til I don't know who I am

Really want to see y'all flaunt your style
Get wild, baby, get a little crazy
Don't hesitate, won't take no/maybe
(Move) not like an eviction
But me and you baby all cause friction
Hm, as my eyed undress you
Just want to let you know there's no pressure
Body conversation, they both want pleasure
But your girl cock-blocked and won't let you
Hm, what you gonna do now
Bounce, rock, shake and we can all while out
Let it all flow like a river now
Check me, check me, check ch-check me on out

If the ladies in the disco club
Are freaking in the disco club
And dancing in the disco club
And shaking in the disco club
If you take me to the disco club

Uh huh
La da da da da

Sorry sorry sorry sorry
Hey, baby my nose is getting big
I noticed it be growing when I been telling them fibs
Now you say your trust's gettin' weaker
Probably 'cos my lies just started gettin' deeper
And the reason for my confession is that I learn my lesson
And I really think you have to know the truuth
Because I lied and I cheated and I lied a little more
But after I did it I don't know what I did it for
I admit that I have been a little immature
Fucking with your heart like I was the pre-da-tor
In my book of lies I was the editor
And the author
I forged my signature
And now I apologize for what I did to ya
'Cos what you did to me I did to you

Nononono baby, nononono don't lie
Nononono, yeah you kno kno kno know you gotta try
What you gonna do when it all comes out
When I see you & what you're all about
Nonono babe, nononono don't lie
Yeah you kno kno kno know you gotta try

She said I'm leaving
'Cos she can't take the pain
It's hard to continue this love it ain't the same
Can't forget the things that I've done inside her brain
Too many lies committed too many games
She feeling like a fool getting on the last train
Tryin' to maintain but the feeling won't change
I'm sorry for the things that I've done and what I became
Caught up in living my life in the fast lane
Blinded by lights, cameras, you know the fame
I don't know the reason why I did these things

And I lie and I lie
And I lie and I lie

And now our emotions are drained
'Cos I lie and I lie and a little lie lie
And now your emotions are drained

Nononono baby, nononono don't lie
Nononono, yeah you kno kno kno know you gotta try
What you gonna do when it all comes out
When I see you & what you're all about
Nonono babe, nononono don't lie
Yeah you kno kno kno know you gotta try

Ooh ooh ooh ooh, ooh ooh ooh
Ba da ba da ba da ba da badabada

Yo, I'm lying to my girl
Even though I love her
And she all in my world
I give her all my attention and diamonds & pearls
She's the one who makes me feel on top of the world
Still I lie to my girl, I do it

And I lie and I lie and I lie 'til there's no turning back
I don't know why, and I lie and I lie 'til I don't know who I am

Nononono baby, nononono don't lie
Nononono, yeah you kno kno kno know you gotta try

Make a little money, buy a fancy car
Big old house and an alligator
Just to match with them alligator shoes
He's a rich man so he's no longer singing the blues
He's singing songs about material things
And platinum rings and watches that go bling
But, diamonds don't bling in the dark
He a star now, but he ain't singing from the heart
Sooner or later he's just gonna fall apart
Cause his fans can't relate to his new found art
He ain't doing what he did from the start
And that's putting in some feeling and thought
He decided to live his life shallow
Cash in his love for material

And its gone, gone, going,
Gone, everything gone, give a damn,
Gone be the birds when they don't want to sing,
Gone people, up awkward with their things, gone.

You see yourself in the mirror
And you feel safe cause it looks familiar
But you afraid to open up your soul
Cause you don't really know, don't really know
Who is, the person that's deep within
Cause you are content with just being the name brand man
And you fail to see that its trivial
Insignificant, you addicted to material
I've seen your kind before
Your the type that thinks souls is sold in a store
Packaged up with incense sticks
With them vegetarian meals
To you that's righteous
You're fiction like books
You need to go out to life and look
Cause, what happens when they take your material
You already sold your soul and its

You say that time is money and money is time
So you got mind in your money and your money on your mind
But what about, that crime that you did to get paid
And what about, that bid, you can't take it to your brain
Why you on about those shoes you'll wear today
They'll do no good on the bridges you've walked along the way

All that money that you got gonna be gone
That gear that you rock gonna be gone
The house up on the hill gonna be gone
The gold, on your grill gonna be gone
The ice on your wrist gonna be gone
That nice little Miss gonna be gone
That whip that you roll gonna be gone

Rappers wanna be down, but listen listen
You got to feel it within your body and your spirit
When you listen to the rhythm (come on)
It's the abstract Will's on the beat
Women all around the globe, the world
You got to follow me
Change your history, categories
Different people in the same territories
Hip-hop in here for my Black Eyed Peas
So watch it watch it be marveled on the speakers please
'Cause they gonna marvel and shake the ground
Break addles break the sound
Fill the embraceful pound
Treat all the things profound
If you wanna dude to help you out
Make it cool around your friends without smoking now

And you could work it out, yeah you could work it out

And I got it like that also
Got a style that's way out like Bosto
You know I'm a crook a nigga like Chocko
Steady jumpin' around like it's heavy cargo
(Can I kick it?) Yup, really far though
From El Segundo to Toronto
I once hit a girl up in Chicago
But I'd never say who unless my name was Tanto
Yup, you know how the date rape go
'Cause we show the classic example
Now they know the Peas collect the dough
So they knocking on our door like we was Fargo
Yup, they see me in a Will.I.Am suit
But I wasn't that cute when I didn't have the loot
And I don't smoke birds but I'm still real nice with the birds
So fuck (hey!) what you heard

Yo, my life got me running through a maze like a white rat
I need a shot at ramming like my rap
It's like the yak is the fights that got me spillin' on the right track
And I like this Will so I might get ill
On the mics somebody might get killed
So many damn rappers there's a stifle in heaven
My tongue is a weapon and plus when I bust all this stuff with Legend
When this Brooklyn MC come after you
You be running like I herd a carrel at Murdell Avenue
There we yattin' that ain't pretty that's the attitude
To be at Fight Club, even Brad had to crack a tooth
Stare into the sun, they try to copy
Let your eyes get used to the light because you gotta watch me
Sneak up on you like sake
My lyrics get out a split atom like Hiroshima and Nagasaki

It's the Apl.De.Ap in the lab with the rap
Demonstrate how we act, we attack any track
It's the Black Eyed Peas and we back with the facts
Start with the fat skills that rose in the past
We got it like how you know how to beast rocks
Entertain you, see you soon at the next spot
The crew got you bouncing and dropping your eye
Making you
Tss tsss tsss, I'm a roll with the hot
I'm a flow from the soul when you can't hold me back
Ke-ke-keep on keep on rolling the track
I'm a simply simply always attach

All they want is (a boom, boom, boom, boom)

Hey y'all, John Coltrane yeah he plays the sax
Me, myself I love to max
Up in the studio laying tracks
Burn it on the CD, melt the wax
And now I'm feeling fine
Coz daily music's on my mind
And I feel mellow
When I watch the girl play the cello
Hello to all my fellow peers in here for the quality
Music quality, yeah
That'll be the focus in the top pick of the day
So pass the peas like we used to say
Pass the beats like they used to say
Pass the phunk like they used to say
That's my joint like we used to say

The soul is caged no bits now free
Unless the rhyme was rocked by me
I got the balls to bang (baw ba-ba-baw, ba-ba-baw, ba-baw bang)
Yeah, steady, just doing my thang (steady, just steady, just doing my own thang)
I just do it (ha!)

My momma said to do what you know
So I'ma do what I know
James Brown gave me the fluid
That means a baby could do it
The Peas will do it so

Do it, do it, do it
Get up on the stage and release my fluid
Do my thing, do it through the music

The Black Eyed Peas,"[Chorus]
(One for all, one for all)
(It's all it's all for one)
Let's start a union, calling every human
It's one for all and all for one
Let's live in unison, calling every citizen
It's one for all and all for one

We don't want war, can't take no more
It's drastic time for sure
We need a antidote and a cure
Coz do you really think Mohamed got a problem with Jehovah
We don't want war imagine if any prophet was alive
In current days amongst you and I
You think they'd view life like you and I do
Or would they sit and contemplate on why
Do we live this way, act and behave this way
We still live in primitive today
Coz the peace in the destination of war can't be the way
There's no way, so people, just be a woman, be a man
Realize that you can't change the world by changing yourself
And understand that we're all just the same
So when I count to three let's change

[Chorus]

Got no time for grand philosophy
I barely keep my head above the tide
I got this mortgage, got three kids at school
What you're saying is the truth, but really troubles me inside
I'd change the world if I could change my mind
If I could live beyond my fears
Exchanging unity for all my insecurity
Exchanging laughter for my tears

[Chorus]

I don't know, y'all, we in a real deposition
In the midst of all this negative condition
Divided by beliefs, different sink and religion
Why do we keep missing the point in our mission?
Why do we keep killing each other, what's the reason?
God made us all equal in his vision
I wish that I could make music as a religion
Then we could harmonize together in this mission
Listen, I know it's really hard to make changes
But two of us could help rearrange this curse
Utilizing all the power in our voices
Together we will unite and make the right choice
And fight for education, save the next generation
Come together as one
I don't understand why it's never been done
So let's change on the count of one

It takes one, just one
And then one follows the other one
And then another follows the other one
Next thing you know you got a billion
People doing some wonderful things
People doing some powerful things
Let's change and do some powerful things
Unity could be a wonderful thing

I once hit a girl up in Chicago
But I'd never say who unless my name was Tanto
Yup, you know how the date rape go
'Cause we show the classic example
Now they know the Peas collect the dough
So they knocking on our door like we was Fargo
Yup, they see me in a Will.I.Am suit
But I wasn't that cute when I didn't have the loot
And I don't smoke birds but I'm still real nice with the birds

It's like the yak is the fights that got me spillin' on the right track
And I like this Will so I might get ill
On the mics somebody might get killed
So many damn rappers there's a stifle in heaven
My tongue is a weapon and plus when I bust all this stuff with Legend
When this Brooklyn MC come after you
You be running like I herd a carrel at Murdell Avenue
There we yattin' that ain't pretty that's the attitude
To be at Fight Club, even Brad had to crack a too
Stare into the sun, they try to copy
Let your eyes get used to the light because you gotta watch me
Sneak up on you like sake
My lyrics get out a split atom like Hiroshima and Nagasaki

Entertain you, see you soon at the next spot
The crew got you bouncing and dropping your eye
Making you

Hoy pare pakinggan nyo ko
Eto nang tunay na filipino
Galing sa baryo sa pangbato
Pumunta ng LA nagtrabaho
Para makatulong sa nanay
Dahil sa hirap ng buhay
Pero masaya parin ang kulay
Pag kumain nagkakamay
Yung kanin, chicken adobo
Yung balot, binebenta sa kanto
Tagay mo na nga ang baso

And I feel mellow 
When I watch the ? play the cello 
Hello to all my fellow peers in here for the quality 
Music quality, yeah 
That'll be the focus in the top pick of the day

Without you I'm a whole different person
I don't even act like I used to
I don't even feel loved like I used to
I guess its your love that I used to
And I feel bad that I had to lose you
I get so many things that I wanna (sa-sa-sa-sa)
I guess this mean that I'm missing you
Sorry for the things that I did to you
I'm so lost without you

And its true that I love you
And it's true your the only one and I do,
I adore you

Livin' in the streets

Street livin', caught in the trap
Guns or books, sell crack or rap
Be like kings or be like pawns
They called us coons, now they call us cons
Street niggas be packing pistols
Terrorists be blasting missiles
Crips and Bloods and retail thugs
CIA planes bring Colombian drugs in
Don't push me 'cause I'm close to hell
The teachers in my neighborhood can hardly spell
And compare to them, prison guards get paid well
Ten years no bail is 4 years at Yale
So, forget about the statue of General Lee
Because the status of Blacks are generally
Gonna end up in some penitentiary
Systematically, that's how they made it to be
Listen, they derailed the soul train
And put a nightmare in every Martin Luther King
And privatized prisons are owned by the same
Slave masters that owned the slave trade game
And racists no longer have to be racist
'Cause niggas kill more niggas than the KKK did
Now, every time I hear a new def jam
Niggas killing niggas like they Ku Klux Klan
I understand what's a nigga to choose?
Be the killer or be the dead dude in the news
I get it, what's a nigga to do?
No education in the hood got a nigga confused

Street livin', tough conditions
Brainwashed by the television
We lost in the war we live in
Double cross, love lost, no religion
Street livin', oh my gosh
Another brother got shot by the searg'
Another cop got off with no charge
If you black in the hood, you at large
You're guilty until you prove you're innocent
If you're ivory, they treat you different
If you're ebony, they assume your temperament
Will be vigilant and they call you militant
And you'll get shot and they'll say the incident
Is 'cause you're belligerent, what a coincidence?
Born and bred but you're still an immigrant
And if you ain't dead, you can see imprisonment

There's more niggas in the prisons than there ever was slaves cotton picking
There's more niggas that's rotting in the prisons than there ever was slaves cotton picking
So, how we gon' get up out the trap?
Guns or books, sell crack or rap
Street livin', hustle or hoops
Guns or books, get shot or shoot

Street livin', ain't no rules
Break the law, make the breakin' news
The life you choose could be the life you lose
Niggas getting stuck for the Nike shoes
Street livin', ain't no joke
It's a cold world, better bring your coat
Revoke 'cause the streets are broke
And now they wanna take away our dreams and hopes
Street livin', no economics
No way out of the Reaganomics
Infected by the black plague, new bubonic
No comprende, we speak ebonics
Street livin', what's your position?
You can take action or take a dick and listen
You can get fucked by the system
Or you can say ""fuck the system""",Street Livin',2018

Cross over the river the gold is waiting
And it's years since the colour I've seen
And it's no use just sitting and Lady Luck blaming
I'll pack up and make the break clean

Chorus

Farewell to the gold that never I found
Goodbye to the nuggets that somewhere abound
For it's only when dreaming that I see the gleaming
Down in the dark deep underground

Well it's nearly two years since I left my own mother
For adventure and gold by the pound
And with Jimmy the prospector, he was another
To the hill of Otago we were bound

Chorus

Well we worked the Cardona, dry valleys all over
Old Jimmy Williams and me
They were panning good dirt on the winding shot over
So we headed down there just to see

Chorus

We sluiced and we cradled for day after day
Making hardly enough to get by
Then a terrible flood swept poor Jimmy away
During six stormy days in July

The Black Family,"


When I was young me father said to me, he said to me
He said never take advice when it comes for free
Cause you can have all the riches of the golden kind
But without the riches of your peace of mind
He said you won't make old bones
You won't make old bones
You won't make old bones you'll see

And as the old men sit and curse times slipping sand, slipping sand
I sit and I curse the time upon my hands
And the north wind blows like a song of the sea
The song that it carries comes quite plain to me
And says you won't make old bones .....

Now there is some folks make remarks and me fetals in frown, me fetals in frown
And says the only way you can get up is when they turn you down
Now everybody gives me the same advice
They said go sign up for the soldiers life or
You won't make old bones.......

So I went to the army like everybody told me to do, they told me to do
They said we'd love to make a soldier out of you
But before I put me name down on the line
Me fathers words came to me on time, he said
You won't make old bones ....

I said your guns and your drums are not for the likes of me, the likes of me
For me future it might look bleaker than bleak can be 
'Cause your talk of many owing much to few
When all that I wanted was a job to do, he said
You won't make old bones.......

So you people in power and position I tell you beware, I tell you beware
Of your tacts and your figures to tell you what went where 
'Cause your facts and your figures are the likes of me
And don't try and tell me how me life should be or
You won't make old bones....

Chorus

Oh the grace that true love holds
When hearts grow weary for time alone
You give it room and the warm to hold
And it'll always come home

True love is faithful all on it's own
Hearts know when they should fly alone
When the mind is rested and the hearts at ease
Two loves car give to each other's needs

Chorus

You can fool yourself and fool your dreams
But you can't fool your heart and you can't fool me
Love is a sailor sailing out to sea
One of these days you'll need a harbour in me

I'll take it as it comes, any way you choose to give it

I challenge you to make a wrong move
A wrong move, a wrong move
Even when your acting the fool I cannot see through you
Through you, through you
The culmination of experience that I can only ever dream of
Is tearing your clothes off
How many lifetimes does it take to live in the present day
Live in the present day, live in the present day

[Chorus: x2]

Any way you choose to give it is sincerely a pleasure of mine
Mine, mine, mine, mine, mine, mine
But don't think you can imitate the accent of fate
You've got to walk the line, walk the line
And I can think of a few things to say to make things right
But by the time I say them we will be in different light

But now times led my mind astray, something was changed along the way
And no amount of tears can bring it back round til it comes again

So maybe we should pretend we're who we want to be
And forget who we really are and where we really be
Cause I've no time to start again but I won't to a bitter end
Can we keep it down til its back round til it comes
Again

Until it comes again, until it comes again

One more time to take the test to make it real
Or one more nail in this relationship make it
Impossible to heal
On the good ship hope we sail but the stars above say

Til it comes again

So maybe we should pretend we're who we want to be
And forget who we really are and where we really be
Cause I've no time to start again but I won't lie to a bitter end
Can we keep it down until it's back round
Til it comes again?

Until it comes again, until it comes again

Or one more nail in this relationship make it impossible to heal

When the first light came around.

I pick all the faults.
Well I concede all the faith tests,
Just ot stick in your throats.

To mirror all that you've done,
To find the right side of reason,
To kill the three lies for one,

I can see through your eyes.
All this talk made no contact.
No matter how hard we tried.

I can still hear the footsteps.
I can see only walls.
I slid into your man-traps,
With no hearing at all.
I just see contradiction,
Had to give up the fight,
Just to live in the past tense,
To make believe you were right.

With a mind that multiplied the smallest matter

When questioned who had sent for him

For his tongue it could not speak but only flatter

It was there he made his bed
And oftentimes he could be seen returnin?

Until one day he just appeared
With a note in his hand that read
The soles of my feet, I swear they're burnin?

Oh, the leaves began to fall
The seas began to part
And the people that confronted him were many

And he was told but these few words
Which opened up his heart

Rollie Fingers in the back, son rolled the bag up
Street had the pen and the pad, he threw a tag up
Uncooked beef in the street, they tagged the rag up
Goldie got the clip from the closet and filled the gat up
Bobby sharpened the razor, oiled the bat up
Let the dogs out the basement, pulled the rap up
Somehow the Brown cats about to get clapped up
Pussy high nigga off coke tried to act up
Against the world's greatest mind, Bob Digital
Might throw a Shaolin Hand-block or a fifty-two
My young son Big Un don't fuck with Patty Cake
Bound to walk through the woods barefoot, choke a rattlesnake
While his brother Mel ???, dissect it
Up in the project life, the street's be hectic
The gun burst, son shot his tongue first
Should've shot his tongue first, should've shot the gun first
Now chew on the Sunburst, bitch, it's Bobby's day
Lyrics for the out, click click, like shotti's spray
Tear through flesh/bone, get lodged up in your ass cheek
'cause you came talkin' that same bullshit last week
Fuckin' cokehead nigga, what? Your brain numb?

Up in the thirty-six cell block I Shadowbox
Ship on weed grass and build up like a male ox

I spit the flavor for the ear, shit for the streets
Rollin' in the cutty about five niggas deep
One SK, two Tec-9's and two sticks
Ready to trip on these fools around my way poppin' shit
Like the Black Knights don't air them things out
Knuckle up in the spot 'til someone get drops
Stomped, get passed out
Passed out off a pint of that pah, ready to mic brawl
Clean sweep, took the first pitch, knocked the homerun
Black Knights known to grab mics, leave the spots full blown
You know motto, the +Knights or Nuttin'+, so stop frontin'
Like you ain't heard this high pitch through your twelve-inch
Don't care which Alpines, I keep those six-by-nines thumpin'
+Jumpin' Jumpin'+ like Destiny, I laced it with the Rugged recipe
You know my technique on a Ra' beat
Speak the Digi slurred speech but aggressive with the mic
On mine, it's strictly Black Knights
Steal the spotlight, show niggas how to rock mics
the right way, spit like a K, M-o-n-k
The conqueror, smash your sponsor

The Black Knights,"Well, you wouldn't read my letters if I wrote you
You asked me not to call you on the phone
There's something I've been waiting for to tell you
So I wrote it in the words of this song

You never knew there were honky tonk angels
Or you might have known I'd never make a wife
You walked out on the only one who ever loved you
So I went back to the wild side of life

Now the glamor of the good life always lead me
To the places where the wild liquor flows
I tried to be your one and only angel
But I'm not that kind of angel, heaven knows

I cried so hard the day you went and left me
'Cause some things you said, they cut me like a knife
What you wanted was another kind of angel
And you should be back to the wild side of life

No, well, I guess I'm just a honky tonk angel
I might have known I'd never make a wife
Well, you left the only one who ever loved you
And I'm back here on the wild side of life

I'm only a honky tonk angel

I guess my baby's got another date

Stood up, brokenhearted again
Well, I know just what I ought to do
I ought to find me somebody new
But baby I couldn't forget about you
Stood up, brokenhearted again
 
Why must I always be the one
left behind never havin' any fun

But I guess I'll go on bein' a fool

With pretty feet smelling like Victoria Sec'
I could see her bra and panties were pink
Looking Spanish or Greek, finest thing I seen all week
Moving with her cousin and niece
I'm moving with my mans Monk and P
Stand at the wall, long chrome 3-3-3

Butt-naked on their hands and knees
Roll up the trees, burn somethin' 'fore we leave

Cause they know it's Big Pimping going on in here
And in the VIP, ho's take it off in here
So get at me 'cause I know you want to spit at me
And I'd be a fool to let that fat ass pass me

Caught some eye candy, sipping on Coke mixed with Remy

A nigga 12, dropping treasures like the jewels of the Nile
Twenty-seven, man-child from the Isle of Shaolin
We sky Sushi bar, Meoshi par, finest cigars
And the ladies in the place want to know who we are
Gumah Oz Dubar, my hand all in her bra
So what's the deal ma'? Can me and my Clan Bar Mitzvah?
Call your girlfriends, after-party, house on the hill
Come and do real, she said ""I'm burning heart off the pill""
Drinks for free, I got my own VIP
Two or three, or it can be just you and me
Let's get it on and popping, crack-a-latin with no debating
No time for the faking, baby girl what's shaking?

[Monk]
Catch Monk in the midst of party cracking, don't dance
But I boogie to the beat low key, I stay splashed
And drunk still drinking, popping major with the ho's, I'm grooving
With this fat bitch, she stuck with my slang and my dress code
I got close, whispered ""What's up with the Bar Mitzvah?""
Then I grabbed her ass, she laughed with a porno look
And pussy popped her ass on rhythm with the beat
But passed, she with her man but her friends came two cars deep

You looking down on everyone
And wondering who loves you?

When you scream
(You're standing on the edge
Looking down on everyone)

That you're scared
(You're standing on the edge
Looking down on everyone)

We are the ones that
Break down from the hopelessness

You're standing on the edge
You looking down on everyone
And wondering who loves you?

When I do
When I do
When I do

Some things never change
(Some things can never change)
(Some things can never change)
When I do

The Black Maria,"The sad news came today
That you gave up, you quit, you're walking away
And you can't find the right words to say
That you are a part of a ship that's sinking

We'll hang ourselves up with our broken dreams
Convince ourselves that we are better then this
Our commitment's a sickness
We'll hang ourselves up with our broken dreams
And tell ourselves that we almost made it
Our commitment's a sickness

And they say this too, shall pass
But we're getting older with no closure or direction

We'll hang ourselves up with our broken dreams
Convince ourselves that we are better then this
Our commitment's a sickness
We'll hang ourselves up with our broken dreams
And tell ourselves that we almost made it
Our commitment's a sickness

We'll hang ourselves with our dreams
We'll hang ourselves with doubt
We'll hang ourselves with our dreams
We're always hanging on

We'll hang ourselves with our dreams
We'll hang ourselves with doubt

We'll hang ourselves up with our broken dreams
Convince ourselves that we are better then this
Our commitment's a sickness
We'll hang ourselves up with our broken dreams
And tell ourselves that we almost made it
Our commitment's a sickness
