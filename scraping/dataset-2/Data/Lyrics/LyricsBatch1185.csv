The Unknown Project,"Lately things they do not feel the same
What we'll become full of hatred full of shame
Once was a face now is only just a name
The gift of life that we were treating like a game then

Something else dies inside me stripped away by another act of violence
Don't try to look cause you won't find me when I'm not there

And the scars that we wear - They will never go away
And the friends that we lose - The can never be replaced
Tell me what its going to take - And how many have to die
Till we put away our hate - And we open up our eyes

Sixteen years old when I lost my first friend
I tried to teach a broken heart how to bend
Twenty four and it happened yet again
More broken hearts is it ever going to end- cause...

Something else dies inside me stripped away by another act of violence
Don't try to look cause you won't find me when I'm not there

And the scars that we wear - They will never go away
And the friends that we lose - The can never be replaced
Tell me what its going to take - And how many have to die
Till we put away our hate - And we open up our eyes

God damn this feeling don't want to feel this again
My heart is bleeding your hate has taken my friend

Twenty two passed away before his time
Too quick to use our fists instead of our minds
So Concerned with what's yours and what is mine
Well maybe we can learn to love this time- cause...

If something else dies inside me - I'll run away yeah
You're never going to find me - The things I see always remind me -
Of how unfair everything is

Something else dies inside me stripped away by another act of violence
Don't try to look cause you won't find me when I'm not there

And the scars that we wear - They will never go away
And the friends that we lose - The can never be replaced
Tell me what its going to take - And how many have to die
Till we put away our hate - And we open up our eyes
Until we open up our eyes - Until we open up our eyes - Until we open up our eyes
Tell me what it's going to take - And how many have to die

The Unseen,"Father looks down to his son
Says ""I was like you when I was young""
Son looks up to father's plans
Works in the factory with his hands

Says ""I want to be just like you,
Organize the work for the collective few""
But as he grows up he sees no change
Systems won't let you rearrange!

Some day people will say
""Do we have to live this way?""
""Is this how we have to exist?""
And the people will rise up, and resist!

A majority class dominates
A world that the lower class creates
Media confusion hides the fact
That we work with the rich man's knife in our back
We're killing ourselves for a profit gain
A profit off life what a fucking shame
We burn that flag for the values sworn
Some day we'll burn it to keep warm

What we have done will not be lost
To all eternity
Everything ripens at its time
And becomes fruit eventually!

You were ruining my life the damage had been caused

And then you moved in like a terrential rain storm 
You had nowhere to go but I knew where you were goin' 

You smiled when I was home but you abused when I was gone 
You hit my younger brothers and then you'd taunt me 
And when I would confront you you'd say it was a lie 
Well I was at your funeral happy that you died 

Dead and gone 
That night in the kitchen I trashed my house 
There was a fist fight and I threw you out 
And you were loaded with no place to go

The water finds a way around.

Now you've got your own gravity
Your orbit fills up the room
We join you in your vanity
And sing with you out of tune

",Never Enough,2005
The Unseen Guest,"
He had a book of letters with his name on
From all of the friends he had met
He showed it to me like a Master's degree
From a school not invented yet.

I took the look in his eyes
For the faraway stare of the wise
Didn't see that empty bottle
Didn't notice that open fly

Chorus:

So I followed his lead
One Down,
Two Down,
Like walking in your sleep
Three Down,
Four Down,
Any day of the week.

His legs were no longer his own
They threw him down on the grass
Don't let her know you saw me
Was the first thing that he asked

Turned on my heel to leave
Told her I wasn't well
And I followed myself through the workaday streets
Like a servant called by a bell.

And there's a pool of mirrored streetlights on the ground
And it's the evening after the night before
When my mind is knocking on my door
But I'm pretty sure there's nobody at home.

And I'm trying to leave everything
That I used to do
Trying to save something I can use.

Chorus:
And Out There the sun is shining
And Out There they won't know your name
And Out there you get by without lying
And Out There you won't feel the same.

We're talking 'round in circles
Every day of the week
And I know you're trying to help
But I just turn the other cheek

And I'm taking my own pulse
Taking the pressure of my blood
But I can't find my own heartbeat
And I'd change it if I could.

From what it says on page 5

Chorus:
Sandalista,
The pain of the world is your only relief
Sandalista
The words on your T-shirt your only belief

They carry their water in pots

There's soul in the slums that there's not
Where your dreams are within your reach

She met a guru in the hills of Ladakh
Who found her chakra in the small of her back
Varanasi told him all is one
And Osho let him know that God is fun.

You see, I was born and raised in the slums of the city,
It was a one room shack that slept ten other children besides me.
We hardly had enough food or room to sleep.
It was hard times,
Needed something to ease my troubled mind.
Listen!  my father didn't know the meaning of work,
He disrespected mama, and treated us like dirt.
I left home, seekin' a job that I never did find,
Depressed and downhearted I took to cloud nine,
I'm doin' fine, up here on cloud nine.
Listen one more time I'm doin' fine, up here on cloud nine.
Folks down there tell me,
They say, ""give yourself a chance son, don't let life pass you by"".
But the world of reality is a rat race where only the strongest survive,
It's a dog eat dog world, and that ain't no lie.
Listen!  it ain't even safe no more to walk the streets at night,
I'm doin' fine, on cloud nine.
Let me tell you about cloud nine.

Cloud nine, you can be what you wanna be
(cloud nine) you ain't got no responsibility,
And ev'ry man, ev'ry man is free
(cloud nine)  and you're a million miles from reality.
I wanna say I love the life I live,
And I'm gonna live the life I love up here on cloud nine.

If all we are is all we know
Then yes my dear, we die alone
If all we are is all we know
Know this my dear, you gave me hope

I'm the devil at your death bed
The ghost in your machine

Whoever's calling the shots fell asleep at the wheel
You ran over my heart and split both of my heels
It's all in your head and life's all in your head
And I know it's so sad to bear

A death aura left over from the night I should've died
It's a shame he didn't cut me when he well had the chance
'Cause this subway home is a lonely ride

My heart is bleeding
My soul is teething, ready to break away
From this new life
A newborn ready to die

Allow the expound of my hindsight
'Cause doc's making rounds
And it's not looking too bright
Just let me sleep, know I am fine
Knowing you love me, did you?

I thought I'd reach you by landline

Are looks and faded memories better off just left that way
Time is only on your side
Until it takes your better days and washes them away

I haven't seen you in so long
These past few years it seems have treated you well
I thought by now that I'd see it

You don't know me anymore

Are looks and faded memories better off just left that way
Time is only on your side
Until it takes your better days and washes you away

Like an avalanche or the rising tide
It will take you away like a speeding car

The siren song before the final bow
The dying screams before my ears give out
Ironic how I actually said I'd miss the sound

Making plans

Will you take us so far away?
Make us more, make us whole
Strip us bare of all desire

Hell, I wouldn't mind a bit
Just give it a taste, it might abate
The heartache I feel deep inside of you

We could never truly understand
That we may never see the blinding light
Perhaps no tunnels ever led to gates of white

He gave heed to nothing, and all that he was
Is just a tragedy

So he voyages in circles
Succeeds getting nowhere
And submits to the substance
That first got him there

Than in violent, frustration he cries out to God or just no one
Is there a point to this madness and all that he was
Is just a tragedy

Be my chance to say goodbye

And I am not afraid to die.
I'm not afraid to bleed, and fuck, and fight.
I want the pain of payment.

Would you be my thousand fucks?

To fill, and spill over, and under my thoughts.

Pressing down on you no man ask for

Splits a family in two

Screaming `let me out'

Why can't we give love that one more chance
Why can't we give love, give love, give love, give love, give love

And love dares you to care for

Whose glances can cripple

Time has never been my best suit
Now I've got everything except you
You moved out of my heart, still got the bruise
I'd give it all back to be next to you

To the sound of something moving past your window in the wind
And if you're quick enough to rise
You'll catch a fleeting glimpse of someone's fading shadow
Out on the new horizon
You may see the floating motion of a distant pair of wings
And if the sleep has left your ears
You might hear footsteps running through an open meadow

Don't be concerned, it will not harm you
It's only me pursuing somethin' I'm not sure of
Across my dreams with nets of wonder
I chase the bright elusive butterfly of love

You might have heard my footsteps
Echo softly in the distance through the canyons of your mind
I might have even called your name
As I ran searching after something to believe in
You might have seen me runnin'
Through the long-abandoned ruins of the dreams you left behind
If you remember something there
That glided past you followed close by heavy breathin'

Who truly don't love me
I don't want the heartaches that I had before 
He wants me for the moment and another girl he'll see
And through long and sleepless nights
When I'm tossin' and turnin'
My heart will be burning
Oh yeah (get out of here, 
Love bug leave my heart alone)
I don't want to love him
Get out of here love bug leave my heart alone
You know, you know, he don't love me

And now it's sad how much like dad

No doubt, you burned out long ago
You know, you once stole the show

But now you steal my youth
Just to keep yourself alive, you are me at thirty five

And say, sunshine, I'm not the only one who's dying

Stay with me, we're never giving up the coast

That I've really got no control
I'm a live twenty fine
But I've still got no control
Of me of you
Control of the hole
That the post comes through
One stop here two stops there
One big scream and I'm back in my chair
I'm alive to the fact that
I've really got no control
I'm a live twenty five
But I've still got no control;

And we talk too much
And we won't let go
We relax too much
In the after glow
But we're alive at the marquee
Live at the Marquee

And it's just another country
But they change there times and sides
Like the farcical feet of a marching band
So we're all getting cynical
Their smiles may fade
But we don't care anymore
We're a boys brigade
So we all die of cancer
For a few flowers outside
Or a day in the life of a fruit machine
And we're all playing asteroids
There's a score on the screen
Not a soul in the worlds gonna beat
But it won't stop me",Live at the Marquee,1981

Both hungry and simple, and calm and warm.

Here it comes,
sixty seconds in---to you.

Feinds meet strangers, and strangers are freinds,

They're here tonight, no fear tonight.
And the hands on the faces have started to move,
It's slow at first, but it's over to soon.

You really can't take it no more

I'm trying to think
I can't think clear

Everybody's talking to me
It's gone foggy in here

But as time goes marching home again
It leaves me to reflect
Or was this just a waste of time
Or was this time well spent

And if it marches back again
And orders me to smile
Then will I be prepared
Or will it take a little while

Which is it to be? One dead romance
Or a handful of dreams? Please tell me
It makes all the difference to me
And I really want to know

I've done so many things I suddenly regret
If I could only compromise and you'd try to forget
A single kiss, a lovers wish, the past dissolves in tears
The present burns inside of me, the future disappears

Laying bare with the granite and the moths
Up, I clambered and I was met by the sun
It was then I saw you there, down on the street

My love
You've come such a long way
With no one to comfort you
Or to tell you you're needed

You and I come from the same place
But if I were to come for you
What's there left to believe in?

So I signaled up to the high and crumbling moon
We've made it then, my love
Closed both my eyes and crawled under the sink
And as I dreamt, I swear, I felt you in my arms again

You've come such a long way
With no one to comfort you

You and I come from the same place
But if I were to come for you
What's there left to believe in?

You're all I have left to believe in

",Calliope!,2006
The Veils,"There's an old child's swing set on the lawn
And an ivied wall lured by the years
A neckerchiefed spaniel patrols the swamp
And drinks from the garden of our tears

There are many rooms and many floors
A billion up and a billion down
I'm not sure God knows we're here
Most nights It keeps to Itself

There's a widow's wing and an unloved wing
On the unwanted floor towards the rear
I've tried to memorize their names
But no sooner one dies than another appears

There were Bible verses all down the halls
But they soon got replaced with explicit cartoons
There are lipstick marks on all our collars
And the sign on the gate reads 'Come back soon'

We all do our best to keep it clean
But some guy's minds are like a sieve
Sometimes it's a little hard to sleep at night
In the house where we all live

Now when I walk the grounds at dawn
I hear the sound of far off bells
I lay my feet out in the reeds
And dream of being somewhere else

So, boy, next time you are in town
Just ring the bell and I'll let you in
I don' t think you are going to need directions
Just ask for the house where we all live

I wish you could see this moment
I wish you could see this moment
I wish you could see this moment

",House Where We All Live,2006
The Veils,"How do you preach the word if you don't know how to read?
They hold your soul once you sign the deed
Would the sun still rise if there's no one 'round?
Would the fox be as quick if he hadn't his hound?

Let him go from me

This whole world spins with her feet off the ground
She'll make the stars applaud when she sits back down
There's a bulls blooded fountain in the pit of a moan
That I'll summon an eclipse on my way to the lord

Let him go from me

Ain't nobody ever gonna ever have to die

",Jesus for the Jugular,2006
The Veils,"Mama, when she'd ride that horse
Buried out in Wilson fields
Mama'd tell me all she thought
Mama'd tell me all how riding feels

And I thought
Not yet

Then when mama got too old
No one ever rode that horse
Until one night I stole her key
And I did ride it all night 'till dawn

When I thought
Not yet

It looks an ugly world out there
Of girl-guides and disease and war
I love my little velvet bed
I never want to leave it anymore

At least
Not yet

Charlie was the first I caught
And Charlie was the first I begged
To lay an anchor in my heart
He was running his fingers down the inside of my legs

When I thought
Not yet

All my fears will come to me in dreams
Maybe the end ain't as far as it seems
Not yet revived but not yet mourned
Not quite denied just not yet born

",Not Yet,2006
The Veils,"What say You, Lord
For the Olive boys down in the house of corrections
As they try for love and any form of ascension?
Am I on the right train headed in the wrong direction?
What say You, Lord, what say You, Lord?

Am I living wrong?
Do You see a long road with no one on it
And the right of men that you learnt only to forget?
You see my sad wife and my high margin of profit
But You don't care at all, You don't care at all

What say You, Lord
Now that they're breeding all our animals insane
And the remedy is growing harder to obtain?
There's a white horse running wild through the switch cane
I can hear him now and I feel him

'Til kingdom come
Caught in this frenzy of elimination
Such an irreparable disintegration
My body's twitching with a ready expectation
For kingdom come, my kingdom come

What say You, Lord?
Why is the truth of this so hard to unveil
Though it's true I never knew what this would entail?
From the hands of Christ to the heads of the Daily Mail
I'll see you all and I'll raise you

Now what say you, all?
I wonder when the light is brought up for sale
With the weight of love and the grace of the Baleen Whale
Will the severed heads of state be at all curtailed?
Will they be here at all, will they be dead and gone?

What say You, Lord
Of the serpent-taled, forbidden fish of the harbors
And the ready men, defiant drinkers and charmers?
All lost and summoning the face of their fathers
Can You see them now? I can see 'em

What say you, all?
Do I believe it if I do not want it?
Do I lie alone and keeps my cold hands off it?
Honey, it ain't hard to loose your grip in the midst of all of this
But it ain't far to fall, it's not far at all

",Nux Vomica,2006

To shake, shake from my own sight
Shake, shake from the light of everything
Shake, shake for that which sinks but can't drown

Your face, your face
It will not be back again
Oh fate, your face
To summon it away is to back down

I'm not so alone in here tonight
The light shines off the pennies in the street
And love feels such a plausible delight
And now I've learnt the lyrics in full to Auld Lang Sine

Your face, your face
It will not be back again
Oh fate, your face
To summon it away is to back down

Now the wolves all howl
And the birds all sing it
""She backed down""

And that they're waiting on your need
Piano white and wide and empty

Will it come back to me for long?

I'm still trying to force another
Needle in the camel's eye

Early in the mornin'
Before the crack of dawn,
Sittin' here thinkin'
Oh why was I born?
So broken hearted,
How can I go on?
Since you've been gone, since you've been gone.

I was so happy
With you by my side,
You told me you loved me,
But honey you lied.
You left me here cryin',
How can I go on?
Since you've been gone, since you've been gone.

The night seems like a million years, mmhm,
Waitin' 'til the break of day appears, oh oh oh.
All night long weepin' like a willow,
Tossin' and turnin' on my tear stained pillow,
Guess I'm gonna drown in my own tears.
Gonna go walkin'
By the railroad track,
I'm gonna let the choo-choo cross over my back.
Life ain't worth livin',

The Velvet Underground,"The myriad choices of his fate
Set themselves out upon a plate
For him to choose
What had he to lose

Not a ghost bloodied country
All covered with sleep
Where the black angel did weep
Not an old city street in the east
Gone to choose

And wandering's brother
Walked on through the night
With his hair in his face
On a long splintered cut from the knife of G.T.

The rally man's patter ran on through the dawn
Until we said so long
To his skull-shrill yell

Shining brightly red-rimmed and
Red-lined with the time
Infused with the choice of the mind
On ice skates scraping chunks
From the bells

Cut mouth bleeding razor's
Forgetting the pain
Antiseptic remains cool goodbye
So you fly
To the cozy brown snow of the east
Gone to choose, choose again

Sacrificials remains make it hard to forget
Where you come from
The stools of your eyes
Serve to realize fame, choose again

And roverman's refrain of the sacrilege recluse
For the loss of a horse
Went the bowels and a tail of a rat
Come again, choose to go

And if epiphany's terror reduced you to shame
Have your head bobbed and weaved
Choose a side to be on

If the stone glances off
Split didactics in two
Leave the colors of the mouse trails
Don't scream, try between

The Velvet Underground,"The snow on your eyelids that curtsy with age
Is freezing the stares on tyranny's wings.
The bitter is hard and the warmth of your skin
Is diseased with familiar caresses.

Withdrawing from splendor and royal decay
Among all the triumphs and jaded awards
The angry and blazing circus of sun
Blasphemes as the crown prince arises.

You cannot beget all the sins that you owe
To the people of paradise magic
Pretend to answer passion and form
With foreign rationalizations.

Primroses are the jewels that lurk
Among masks of pleasure that flicker with doubt
Embraces of fame that's simultaneously fear
To advance and demand to be recognized.

The river shall flow through hollow green faces
Of caricature's resentment etched out of the tongues.
Both reluctant princess asleep before birth

Hatred bends the spine

When I'm rushing on my run
And I feel just like Jesus' son
And I guess that I just don't know
And I guess that I just don't know

I have made big decision
I'm gonna try to nullify my life

When it shoots up the dropper's neck
When I'm closing in on death

You can't help me now, you guys
And all you sweet girls with all your sweet talk
You can all go take a walk

And I guess that I just don't know

I wish that I was born a thousand years ago
I wish that I'd sailed the darkened seas
On a great big clipper ship
Going from this land here to that
On a sailor's suit and cap

Away from the big city
Where a man cannot be free
Of all the evils of this town
And of himself and those around
Oh, and I guess that I just don't know
Oh, and I guess that I just don't know

Heroin, it's my wife and it's my life
Because a mainline into my vein
Leads to a center in my head
And then I'm better off than dead

Because when the smack begins to flow
I really don't care anymore
About all the Jim-Jims in this town
And all the politicians making crazy sounds
And everybody putting everybody else down
And all the dead bodies piled up in mounds

'Cause when the smack begins to flow
And I really don't care anymore
Ah, when that heroin is in my blood
And that blood is in my head
Then thank God that I'm as good as dead
And thank your God that I'm not aware

Dressed in silk, Latin lace and envy
Pride and joy of the latest penny faire

Making love to every poor daughter's son
Isn't it fun
Now today propping grace with envy

And hasn't a care

Turning on the machines that neatly pump air
The body lies bare
Shaved and hairless what once was screaming
Now lies silent and almost sleeping
The brain must have gone away
Strapped securely to the white table
Ether caused the body to wither and writhe
Underneath the white light
Doctor arrives with knife and baggage
Sees the growth as just so much cabbage
That now
Must be cut away
Now come the moment of Great! Great! Decision!
The doctor is making his first incision
One goes here - one goes there

The patient it seems is not so well sleeping

And stones are all erupting out for you
And all the cheap bloodsuckers are flying after you

And just like in a movie, her hands became her feet
Her belly button was her mouth
Which meant she tasted what she'd speak
But the funny thing is what happened to her nose
It grew until it reached all of her toes
Now, when people say her feet smell, they mean her nose
And curtains laced with diamonds, dear, for you
And kingdom's Christian sailors (soldiers), dear, for you
And melting ice cap mountains, dear, for you
And knights in flaming silver robes for you
And bats, that with a kiss turn prince for you

But lately Waldo had begun to worry. He had trouble sleeping at night and when
he did, he had horrible dreams. He lay awake at night, tossing and turning
underneath his pleated quilt protector, tears welling in his eyes as he
pictured Marsha, her sworn vows overcome by liquor and the smooth soothing of
some neanderthal, finally submitting to the final caresses of sexual oblivion.
It was more than the human mind could bear.

Visions of Marsha's faithlessness haunted him. Daytime fantasies of sexual
abandon permeated his thoughts. And the thing was, they wouldn't understand how
she really was. He, Waldo, alone understood this. He had intuitively grasped
every nook and cranny of her psyche. He had made her smile. She needed him, and
he wasn't there (Awww...).

The idea came to him on the Thursday before the Mummers' Parade was scheduled
to appear. He'd just finished mowing and etching the Edelsons lawn for a dollar
fifty and had checked the mailbox to see if there was at least a word from
Marsha. There was nothing but a circular from the Amalgamated Aluminum Company
of America inquiring into his awing needs. At least they cared enough to write.

It was a New York company. You could go anywhere in the mails. Then it struck
him. He didn't have enough money to go to Wisconsin in the accepted fashion,
true, but why not mail himself? It was absurdly simple. He would ship himself
parcel post, special delivery. The next day Waldo went to the supermarket to
purchase the necessary equipment. He bought masking tape, a staple gun and a
medium sized cardboard box just right for a person of his build. He judged that
with a minimum of jostling he could ride quite comfortably. A few airholes,
some water, perhaps some midnight snacks, and it would probably be as good as
going tourist.

By Friday afternoon, Waldo was set. He was thoroughly packed and the post
office had agreed to pick him up at three o'clock. He'd marked the package
""Fragile"", and as he sat curled up inside, resting on the foam rubber
cushioning he'd thoughtfully included, he tried to picture the look of awe and
happiness on Marsha's face as she opened her door, saw the package, tipped the
deliverer, and then opened it to see her Waldo finally there in person. She
would kiss him, and then maybe they could see a movie. If he'd only thought of
this before. Suddenly rough hands gripped his package and he felt himself borne
up. He landed with a thud in a truck and was off.

Marsha Bronson had just finished setting her hair. It had been a very rough
weekend. She had to remember not to drink like that. Bill had been nice about
it though. After it was over he'd said he still respected her and, after all,
it was certainly the way of nature, and even though, no he didn't love her, he
did feel an affection for her. And after all, they were grown adults. Oh, what
Bill could teach Waldo - but that seemed many years ago.

Sheila Klein, her very, very best friend, walked in through the porch screen
door and into the kitchen. ""Oh gawd, it's absolutely maudlin outside."" ""Ach, I
know what you mean, I feel all icky!"" Marsha tightened the belt on her cotton
robe with the silk outer edge. Sheila ran her finger over some salt grains on
the kitchen table, licked her finger and made a face. ""I'm supposed to be
taking these salt pills, but,"" she wrinkled her nose, ""they make me feel like
throwing up."" Marsha started to pat herself under the chin, an exercise she'd
seen on television. ""God, don't even talk about that."" She got up from the
table and went to the sink where she picked up a bottle of pink and blue
vitamins. ""Want one? Supposed to be better than steak,"" and then attempted to
touch her knees. ""I don't think I'll ever touch a daiquiri again.""

She gave up and sat down, this time nearer the small table that supported the
telephone. ""Maybe Bill'll call,"" she said to Sheila's glance. Sheila nibbled on
a cuticle. ""After last night, I thought maybe you'd be through with him."" ""I
know what you mean. My God, he was like an octopus. Hands all over the place.""
She gestured, raising her arms upwards in defense. ""The thing is, after a
while, you get tired of fighting with him, you know, and after all I didn't
really do anything Friday and Saturday so I kind of owed it to him. You know
what I mean."" She started to scratch. Sheila was giggling with her hand over
her mouth. ""I'll tell you, I felt the same way, and even after a while,"" here
she bent forward in a whisper, ""I wanted to!"" Now she was laughing very loudly.

It was at this point that Mr. Jameson of the Clarence Darrow Post Office rang
the doorbell of the large stucco colored frame house. When Marsha Bronson
opened the door, he helped her carry the package in. He had his yellow and his
green slips of paper signed and left with a fifteen cent tip that Marsha had
gotten out of her mother's small beige pocketbook in the den. ""What do you
think it is?"" Sheila asked. Marsha stood with her arms folded behind her back.
She stared at the brown cardboard carton that sat in the middle of the living
room. ""I dunno.""

Inside the package, Waldo quivered with excitement as he listened to the
muffled voices. Sheila ran her fingernail over the masking tape that ran down
the center of the carton. ""Why don't you look at the return address and see who
it's from?"" Waldo felt his heart beating. He could feel the
vibrating footsteps. It would be soon.

Marsha walked around the carton and read the ink-scratched label. ""Ah, god,
it's from Waldo!"" ""That schmuck!"" said Sheila. Waldo trembled with expectation.
""Well, you might as well open it,"" said Sheila. Both of them tried to lift the
staple flap. ""Ah sst,"" said Marsha, groaning, ""he must have nailed it shut.""
They tugged on the flap again. ""My God, you need a power drill to get this
thing open!"" They pulled again. ""You can't get a grip."" They both stood still,
breathing heavily.

""Why don't you get a scissor,"" said Sheila. Marsha ran into the kitchen, but
all she could find was a little sewing scissor. Then she remembered that her
father kept a collection of tools in the basement. She ran downstairs, and when
she came back up, she had a large sheet metal cutter
in her hand. ""This is the best I could find."" She was very out of breath.
""Here, you do it. I-I'm gonna die."" She sank into a large fluffy couch and
exhaled noisily. Sheila tried to make a slit between the masking tape and the
end of the cardboard flap, but the blade was too big and there wasn't enough
room. ""God damn this thing!"" she said feeling very exasperated. Then smiling,
""I got an idea."" ""What?"" said Marsha. ""Just watch,"" said Sheila, touching her
finger to her head.

Inside the package, Waldo was so transfixed with excitement that he could
barely breathe. His skin felt prickly from the heat, and he could feel his
heart beating in his throat. It would be soon. Sheila stood quite upright and
walked around to the other side of the package. Then she sank down to her
knees, grasped the cutter by both handles, took a deep breath, and plunged the
long blade through the middle of the package, through the masking tape, through
the cardboard, through the cushioning and (thud) right through the center of
Waldo Jeffers head, which split slightly and caused little rhythmic arcs of red
to pulsate gently in the morning sun.",The Gift,1995

Searing with asides
Caress death with a lover's touch

Preparing for to die

Wrap your troubles in dreams

Come crashing to the shore
Bullies kick and kill young loves
Down on barroom floors

Through the midnight air
Cutting entrails in its path
Blood runs without care

Violence echoes through the land
And the heart of every man
The knife stabs existent wounds
Pus runs through matted hair

Excrements filters through the brain
Hatred bends the spine
Filth covers the body pores
To be cleansed by dying time

The Velvet Underground,"Standing on the corner, suitcase in my hand,
Jack is in his corset, and Jane is in her vest, and, me,
I'm in a rock'n'roll band.
Ridin' in a Stutz-Bearcat, Jim
why'know, those were different times!
Oh, all the poets, they studied rules of verse,
And the ladies, rolled their eyes.

Sweet Jane! Sweet Jane! Sweet Jane!
Jack, he is a banker,
And Jane, she is a clerk.
Both of them are saving their monies,
When, when they come home from work!
Ooh! Sittin' down by the fire, oh!
The radio keeps playin,
A little classical music for you kids,
""The March of the Wooden Soldiers"".
And you can hear Jack say: 

Sweet Jane! Sweet Jane! Oh! Sweet Jane!
Some people, they like to go out dancing,
And other people, they just have to work.
And there's always some evil mothers,
Who'll tell you that life is just full of dirt.
Why'know that, women, never really faint,
And that villains always blink their eyes,
And children are the only ones who blush,
And life is just to die! 

But anyone who ever had a heart,
Oh, they wouldn't turn around and break it.
And anyone who ever played a part,
Oh, they wouldn't turn around and hate it

A ploughin' through the ragged skies
And up a cloudy draw.

Their horns wuz black and shiny and their hot breath he could feel,
A bolt of fear went through him as they thundered through the sky,
For he saw the riders comin' hard
And he heard their mournful cry.

With sweat,

On horses snortin' fire
As they ride on, hear their cry.

Then cowboy change your ways today or with us you will ride
A-try'ng to catch the devil's herd
Across these endless skies.""

Gone from the valleys where rivers used to run 
Gone with the cold wind that swept into my heart 
Gone with the lovers who let their dreams depart 
Where are the green fields that we used to roam?

How can I keep searching when dark clouds hide the day?
I only know there's nothing here for me
Nothing in this wide world left for me to see

I've come to talk with you again,
Because a vision softly creeping,
Left its seeds while I was sleeping,
And the vision that was planted in my brain
Still remains
Within the sound of silence.
In restless dreams I walked alone
Narrow streets of cobblestone,
'Neath the halo of a street lamp,
I turned my collar to the cold and damp
When my eyes were stabbed by the flash of a neon light
That split the night
And touched the sound of silence.

And in the naked light I saw
Ten thousand people, maybe more.
People talking without speaking,
People hearing without listening,
People writing songs that voices never share
And no one dare
Disturb the sound of silence.

""Fools"" said I, ""You do not know
Silence like a cancer grows.
Hear my words that I might teach you,
Take my arms that I might reach you.""
But my words like silent raindrops fell,
And echoed
In the wells of silence

And the people bowed and prayed
To the neon god they made.
And the sign flashed out its warning,
In the words that it was forming.
And the sign said, ""The words of the prophets

Are written on the subway walls
And tenement halls.""
And whisper'd in the sounds of silence.",The Sound of Silence,1997

The Veronicas,"I hate to say it but they play this damn song in every club
But it's me so I'll show love
But it's me so show me love
When I walk into the room people stop and stare
It's like nobody else is there
You know it's me not you
Who said anything about you

[Chorus]
Boys and girls pretend to know me they try so hard
And I get what I want my name is my credit card
Don't try to hate me because I am so pop pop ular pop pop ular

Pop pop ular pop pop ular

Most guys I dated got intimidated so now I date up
If you know what that means they shut up
If you know what that means just shut up
Cause I don't wanna give half away
On a date we don't make up
If you know what I mean we wake up
If you know what I mean we break up

[Chorus]

Pop pop ular pop pop ular

You always wanna be around me
So you know what it's like
When the world is at your feet
And you're VIP tonight
Either you got it or you don't
And I'm sorry you won't
Get there by using me
Just go on do your own thing

The Veronicas,"I saw it in the news
you told me they were wrong
and I stood up for you
cause I believed you were the one

you had all the chances in the world
to let me know the truth
what the hell's wrong with you?

[Bridge]
are you even listening when I talk to you
do you even care what I'm going through
your eyes stare and they're staring right through me
you're right there but its like you never knew me

[Chorus]
do you even know how much it hurt
that you gave up on me to be with her
revenge is sweeter than you ever were

I'm so mad at you right now
and I can't even find the words
and you're on the way down
I can't wait to see you burn
you try to make me hate that girl
when I should be hating you
what the hell's wrong with you

[Bridge]

[Chorus]

revenge is sweeter than you ever were

nothing can save you now that it's over
I guess that you'll find out when you're no one
don't say you're sorry now 'cause I just don't care

nothing can save you now, nothing
nothing can save you now, nothing

The Veronicas,"We got the same friends
We're gonna have to see each other eventually
So won't you tell me how we're gonna deal with that
My cd's are at your place
And you know I'm gonna have to pick em up
So won't you tell me how we're gonna deal with that

Even though it was mutual, it still kills inside
Cause for so long, how I've been defined

[Chorus]
It feels just like I'm going crazy
I guess that this is breaking up
And now not even you can save me
Will someone wake me up
Never thought that we'd go under
I guess we won't be making up
And if this is a dream I wonder
Could someone wake me up

I still have your old shirt
You know the one I said I'd thrown away
I put it on when I went to bed last night
Baby, is this where our story ends
When I turn out the light
Fantasy and reality fight

[Chorus]

Someone wake me up
Someone wake me up

Even though it's over now
It still kills inside
Cause for so long you have been my life

I will always keep you inside",Someone Wake Me Up,2007
The Veronicas,"The lights are out and I barely know you
We're going up and the place is slowing down
I knew you'd come around
You captivated me, something about you's got me
I was lonely now you make me feel alive
Will you be mine tonight

Take me on the floor
I can't take it any more
I want you I want you I want you to show me love
Just take me on the floor
I can give you more
You kill me you kill me you kill me with your touch

My heart is racing as you're moving closer
You take me higher with every breath I take
Would it be wrong to stay

One look at you and I know what you're thinking
Time's a bitch and my heart is sinking down
You turn me inside out

Take me on the floor
I can't take it any more
I want you I want you I want you to show me love
Just take me on the floor
I can give you more
You kill me you kill me you kill me with your touch

I wanna kiss a girl
I wanna kiss a girl
I wanna kiss a boy

I wanna kiss a girl

Take me on the floor

The Veronicas,"You keep calling my phone non-stop
Don't you know I won't pick it up
You never leave a message
Look how you've changed

You got nothing to say, getting in my way
You show up at my house
Your getting so obsessive
Like I have time for you

Wasn't it me you didn't want
Wasn't it me who's hanging on
No I'm done but before I go I want you to know

This is how it feels
When you wait for a call that never comes
Are you waking up 'cause you miss someone
This is how it feels
When the trust you had is broken,
And you're left to burn with your heart wide open

You wanna meet up and tell me why
Why and how you had the heart to fuck up my whole life
That's just so you

And now I've moved on by myself
And baby I won't forgive
I'll just forget you lived
And I hope it hurts

Wasn't it me you try to blame
Wasn't it me you threw away
But before you go there's something you should know

This is how it feels
When you wait for a call that never comes
Are you waking up 'cause you miss someone
This is how it feels
When the trust you had is broken,
And you're left to burn with your heart wide open

You taught me how to hate you
And I was so in love
When I tried to save us it was not enough
So what the hell is different
Cause now that I am gone
You're calling back to tell me
I'm the one

This is how it feels.

This is how it feels
When you wait for a call that never comes
Are you waking up 'cause you miss someone
This is how it feels
When the trust you had is broken,
And you're left to burn with your heart wide open

Do you only want me
Cause you can't have me
Do you only want me
Cause I'm gone
Do you only want me
Cause you can't have me
Do you only want me
Cause I'm gone
Do you only want me
Cause you can't have me
Do you only want me
Cause I'm gone

The Veronicas,"I can see it in your eyes
Taste it in our first kiss
Stranger in this lonely town
Save me from my emptiness

You took my hand
You told me it would be OK
I trusted you to hold my heart
Now fate is pulling me away, from you

[Chorus]
Even if I leave you now
And it breaks my heart
Even if I'm not around
I won't give in
I can't give up

You've become a piece of me
Makes me sick to even think
Of mornings waking up alone
Searching for you in my sheets
Don't fade away

If you love someone

Wake up in the morning, take a breath and let it out
Just forget tomorrow's ever gonna come around
Everybody's medicating taking time and waiting for the right time
In the short life, but it's your life

We can run around in circles we make
Or we could run straight ahead
Never ever let the moment pass by
When all that matters in the end

If you love someone, then tell them right now
'Cause your heart won't rest 'till you let it out
Let the words you dream come out of your mouth
If you love someone
You gotta make a sound
If you love someone
You gotta make a sound
If you love someone

When true love is staring you in the face
But the words that you're feeling never find their way
You're so invisible to the one you want
And you'd give anything to win their love

We can get lost in fears that we make
For days that feel black as night
But there in the dark you find that the stars
Are shining their brightest light

If you love someone, then tell them right now
'Cause your heart won't rest 'till you let it out
Let the words you dream come out of your mouth

The Verve,"I wrote your name in dust on a truck
As it rolled out of town
Just in case my love for you
Might be found
I cried my tears in a mountain stream
They'll sting you one day
I called your name in a giant cave
It echoes to this day

So sister, you're hearing how I miss her
But I don't think that she's hearing my calls
So sister, you're hearing how I miss her
But I don't think that she's hearing my calls
No, I don't think that I'm helping my cause

I wrote our names on a subway wall
Just in case you called
I rent a room and it's just for two
But where are you?

So sister, you're hearing how I miss her
But I don't think that she's hearing my calls

The Verve,"I don't like the way that you say you feel fine
When you look so down
And I don't like the way that the pills you take
They just keep you down

Shiny little minds
Trying to find my way in life
String of broken hearts
Well, they still made it, you ready to start?

Never wanna see you cry
No, I never wanna hold you with tears in your eyes
Never wanna see you burn
There's so much I gotta tell you, so much that you'll learn

I'm dying, dying, baby, dying
To get close to you
But sometimes, sometimes the wall you built
You know, I can't get through

Shiny little minds
Trying to find my way in life
String of broken hearts
Well, they still made it, you ready to start?

I never wanna see you cry
No, I never wanna hold you with tears in my eyes
Never wanna see you die
There's so much I gotta tell you, so much that you'll learn

'Cause I never wanna see you cry
No, I never wanna see you die
No, I never wanna see you cry
No, I never wanna see you cry

'Cause I never wanna see you cry
No, I never wanna see you cry
No, I never wanna see you die
Oh, I never wanna see you die

It's getting me down my love
Like a cat in a bag, waiting to drown
This time I'm comin' down

And I hope you're thinking of me
As you lay down on your side
Now the drugs don't work
They just make you worse

And I'll sing in your ear again

The Verve,"It's alright, alright
We're going through changes
Sometimes in life
You feel yourself rearranging
That's just the way it goes
Come on (repeat)
Why'know we nearly died
Sometimes in life
I see familiar faces
In rooms, in the sky
Like ????? we've tasted
That's just the way it goes
Why'know we nearly died
That's just the way life is
Feels so good to be alive
Three steps to heaven, man
 I took two and I sat back down again
Three steps to heaven, man
 I took two and I sat back down again
It feels so good
To be alive
Three steps to heaven, man
 I took two and I sat back down again

 I took two and I sat back down again
We nearly died

The Verve,"Oh no, no, no, no
And I'm watching her die
On my TV
And the daddy cries
How could it be
And it could be you
And it could be me
Child full of giving
Child full of hoping
 Now it's gone
 Now it's gone
And you're gonna run
 Now it's gone
 Now it's gone
And you're gonna run
 This is where you've never been
And maybe one day you'll follow me
Look ok on the outside
Dead on the inside
And there's nothing to win
Ain't no disease
Child full of giving
Child full of giving
 Yes you were
Child full of hoping
Lying, dying, dead
Child full of hoping
But now it's gone
And you run
 Now it's gone
 Now it's gone
And you're gonna run
You're gonna run
You're gonna run
You're gonna run",The Crab,1997
