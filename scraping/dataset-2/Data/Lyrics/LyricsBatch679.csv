(feat. ATOM)

[Verse 1 - Cowboy Troy]
She's sittin' at the bar, sippin?on a beverage
Try to use your platinum card to get leverage
It don't matter, she's got her own
She's got diamonds for buttons on her cellular phone
She's a cutie with a booty, a hottie with a body
Get her on the dance floor, gonna get naughty
Don't mean no harm, just a little fun
'Til it's time for breakfast and you see the sun

[ATOM]
Can't find the key to the door where her heart is
Can't find no magic word to say all the things I want to say
There's no equation for that rose, she only knows when she goes!

[Chorus - ATOM]
She's automatic, she's automatic
She turns on when she wants to
Don't give her no static, she's automatic
She turns on when she wants to
Automatic

[Verse 2 - Cowboy Troy]
The beat gets fast and you're cravin' more
Suddenly you make you way to the floor
It's a hick-hop beat boy your body is pumped
All the fine ladies just shakin' their butts
Step up to one then you ask her to dance
It appears to you she's in a trance
Take your time son play your position
'Cause that's the primary mission

[ATOM]
Can't find the key to the door where her heart is
Can't find no magic word to say all the things I want to say
There's no equation for that rose, she only knows when she goes!

[Repeat Chorus]

Atom,"Forget your troubles (Happy days)
Come on get happy (are here again)
You better chase all your cares away 
(The skies above are clear again)
Shout hallelujah (So let's sing a song)
Come on get happy (of cheer again)
Get ready for the judgment day (Happy days are here again)

The sun is shining
Come on get happy (Shout it now)
The Lord is waiting to take your hand 
(There's no one who can doubt it now)
Shout hallelujah (So let's tell the world)
And just get happy (about it now)
We're going to the promise land 
(Happy days are here again)

We're heading across the river
Soon your cares will all be gone
There'll be no more from now on
From now on

Forget your troubles (Happy days)
And just get happy (are here again)
You better chase all your blues away 
(The skies above are clear again)
Shout hallelujah (So let's sing a song)
And just get happy (of cheer again)

Happy times (Happy times)
Happy nights (Happy nights)
Happy days

Atom and His Package,"I see you on the street as you walk on by
You make me wanna hang my head down and cry
If you gave me half a chance you'd see
My desire burning inside of me
But you choose to look the other way

I've had to work much harder than this
For something I want
Don't try to resist me

Open your heart to me, darling
I hold the lock and you hold the key
Open your heart to me, baby
I'll give you love if you, you turn the key

I think you're afraid to look into my eyes
(I know they're scary)
You look a little sad but I wonder why
(are you hungry?)
I follow you around but you can't see,
Too wrapped up in yourself to notice
Still you choose to look the other way, fuck face,
I have something to say

Don't try to run, I can keep up with you
And nothing can stop me from trying to find you

Open your heart to me, darling
I hold the lock and you hold the key
Open your heart to me, baby
I'll give you love if you, you turn the key

I am the gatekeeper
You, you have the key, master

One is such a lonely number

Don't try to run, I can keep up with you
And nothing can stop me from trying to find you

Open your heart to me, darling
I hold the lock and you hold the key
Open your heart to me, baby
I'll give you love if you, you turn the key

Open your heart with the key
Open your heart with the key

My head's gone vertical. My bed's gone vertical.

 I took my cares
 And left them all behind

Atomic Kitten,"Ain't no headlights on the road tonight
Everybody here is sleeping tight
Ain't nobody gonna find us here
We'll disappear

There's a dancer in the arms of love
And he's dancing on the sky above
And the truth is that we'll never know
Where love will flow

Aim high, shoot low
We gotta aim high, shoot low baby

[Chorus]
Ain't no headlights on the road tonight
Ain't nobody here to make it right
'Cause we couldn't seem to find a way
For love to stay
If you had another night to give
I would have another night to live
But you're never gonna see me cry the last goodbye

(Last goodbye)

Is it cloudy where you are tonight
All there neon lights shining bright
Are you looking for a place to stay
To get away (don't get away)

And the days are horses down the hill
Running fast with no time to kill
And the truth is that we'll never know
Where love will flow

Aim high, shoot low
We gotta aim high, shoot low baby

[Chorus]

If I could do it over
I'd do it all again (over again)
And if I got one more chance
I wouldn't change a thing

Aim high, shoot low
Aim high, shoot low

Oh, oh
You make me believe
You are the one for me it seems
But now I find it's hard
The way you're treating me, it's mean
Cause time after time 
I keep changing my mind
And I can't get myself over you
 
The moment you leave me, 
The moment you're gone
I don't think that I 
Could last another minute
But when we're together, 
Something's so strong
I don't think 
That we'll ever find a limit
What's going on (what's going on)
What's going on
 
Each time you're down, 
I helped you on your feet but then
Just as soon as you're ready to, 
You left me on my own again

When you lie that you love me
And small promises you couldn't keep
How I tried to believe you 
But my tears they just cut so deep
And I can't get myself over you

So strong and so secure
But all that's left is memories 
The feelings are no more
The flowers in a big field 
All dried and blown away
The letters and the pictures 
Are all that will remain

But every moment 
Of every day
I want to see you
I want to say

No one loves you like I love you 
No one needs you the way I do
No one knows you like I know you 
No one hears you the way I do

Suppressed beyond recall
The feelings once so broken
Seem silent and so small

Of every day

Is spinning round

I wish I knew what's 
Going on in my mind

Someone somewhere stole your desire
The pain akin', to being punched in the throat
And stabbed in the chest

Replaced with lackluster memories you cry
Your screams play in your empty room

It's so hard to see when your eyes are rolling
In the back of your head
It's even harder to speak when everything you say
Just comes out wrong

Your bed swallows you whole as the days bleed together
Torment on the lips of a loved one
And if you try hard enough, you can almost taste her
Feel her pass and scream, oh God why me

When my head rests in a velvet lined casket?
What's out there?
What is my eternal fate?
It only just recently hit me
That this life is just a state
Mortality fading, like the innocence of line
I'm scared to death of what's to become

Of my immortal soul of this eternal flame
Will you remember?
Will your heart sing with pain?
Who calls out my name?
Who can tell me what happens
When my eyes close for the last time?
Does it all simply end in a blanket of darkness
What of my soul, what of my soul?

All those things you couldn't say
You should've said
All those I-love-you's lost
Weighed more like lead on your chest

What if I could take back all those misspent days?
Every second of anger, I would wash my sins away",The Remembrance Ballad,2004
Atreyu,"I feel eyelashes on my cheek
And they lacerate my flesh
A pain so good
Put your hand in mine
Never let go
Never wake up 'cause I'm done with promises
I'm taking blood oaths
Feels likes you could kiss my imperfections
My imperfections away
And I would stand
Stand by your side until the sun turns the sky
All the colors I see in your eyes

I'll never need to see the sun again
There's enough light in your eyes to light up our little world
So take me, take my away
Kill me slowly, I'll never be the same

I swear to you, on everything I am
And I dedicare to you all that I have
And I promise you that I will stand right by your side
Forever and always until the day I die

The bite marks on my neck never felt so good
I'm losing control and it's all that I can do
Not to blackout and fall into lust with you
Your kisses infect me
The dark gift is loving you

And I feel immortal and I want to make you feel the same
So stand by me as we immulate
We can burn in each other's arms",This Flesh a Tomb,2004
Atreyu,"I began my ascent at minue zero
You made so sure of that
You tried to keep me down here
Your complacency has been your downfall
Nobody made you king of the world
And I'm here to dethrone you
So kiss the ring motherfucker
It's my time, my time to shine
Grasping for the straws as they fall
Maybe you can make a splint for your broken ego
For your broken ego

So I say thank you for the scars
And the guilt and the pain
Every tear I've never cried
Has sealed your fucking fate
What did you take me for, a fool?
Or were you just too blind to see
That every effort made has failed
And there is no destroying me?

Hate can be a positive emotion
When it forces you to better yourself
You built me, constructed my desire
Perfected my hatred
Now I'm driven to be ten times better than you think you are
Ten times better than you think you are
Piece by piece I've built my walls
And burned the bridges down
That lead back to people like you
So full of malice, so full of scorn
You tried your best to crush my spirit
You tried to steal my soul
You pushed my back against the wall
And I broke it down
I will not be broken
Though I am the one who bleeds

I will not be broken
I am the one",You Eclipsed by Me,2004
Atreyu,"Come on!! 

I can see her now. 
Dancin' round, her drink in hand. 
All the baggage in tow, 
I just want to forget her, let go. 
All of the joy, the pain. 
I'll take your guilt 
And break it into me. 
And now I kiss it good-bye. 
Our last dance ended fatally.

Another masquerade of our circumstance

Let the blood run through me 
I say goodbye to a word we had

She came and went. 
And on through my hands 
But I stared in her eyes and saw some pieces that say goodbye 
Sometimes when your holding on, you never see the light.

Case and point with dead lovers eyes 
She never looked so good, and I never felt so Right x2

Leaving me only pain

Atreyu,"Go runaway in distress trying
To hide from what's
Creeping and crawling and stabbing
Within try to deny the turmoil inside
If you find yourself far enough you'll never win
In the ounce of serenity
I will come home be pissed(i will come home be pissed)
Can't leave you weeping on the phone
Gasping for breath(i am gasping for breath)
To be left on the floor gasping for breath!

[Chorus]
No he's not the person you are
Or the person your trying trying trying trying to be
Don't let the outside swing to far from where you want to be

We are heading for moments of this
You can roll with the best
Where's your body so brutally pressed
Against the confines of your dead flesh
And if you close your eyes tight enough
Then none of the bad can get in x2
And if you close your eyes tight enough
Then none of the light can get in
You scream as the light hits you
And radiates upon your whole soul
The pain is burning and cleanses anything
It still fucking hurts and your still fucking down
That you are still alone
That you are still in control
Don't know where to go
The day were all dead
Underground back took a chance to out live your past
Where you will be free [Repeatx2]

You Embrace You Betray

That Led You Straight To Hell!

This Is Why I Told You So

If You Knew What I Know
Would You Move Like You Do
With Malicious Discontent
Yeah! What about My Pain to Destroy
But Did You Have a Reason Why

With The Death of It All Then (Start Over!)
Here's To Burying Hatchets with Those Who You Never Call Your Friends
Above The New Day with the Death of It All Then (Start Over!)

With Every Venomous Move I Will Suck You Up and Spit You
Get Out Of My Life Get Out Of My Sight!

Burn to coals as they crush 
And leave nothing that

Rip them, I'll take them
Burn to coals as they crush 

And leave nothing that
Resembles a soul of a man
Leave him numb, leave him crushed 
Leave him numb, leave him crushed

Up against the raging tides 
No more fights 
Everything you ever wanted to see 
I see it in his eyes 
One more time, one more time

My time to test the waters 
My hands feel like they're rusting away 
So obvious, so numb, I can leave before the slaughter 
I'll stay here, as long as you let me

Decisions, then, made obvious, and while they're in tune
Where I started, I'll stay there 
When I'm finished 
I'll wither away

Rip them, I'll take them
Burn to coals as they crush 
And leave nothing that
Resembles a soul of a man

See him numb, see him crushed 
See him numb, see him crushed

You put a bullet in my head
Turned black thoughts to red
This could all end in tragedy

I dream of you dead laid you dead to rest
I won't look back in for memory

But don't rush us out like I sold you
Are you a killer and I think I know its you
I was deep in that night I know its taking this
So hurry up to figure you out to insult'
Your glass kept from falling down
One time from your good times
I'm not interested in working this out

And that's what you are
I said blasterd fucking mess
Fuck off to be without you
Die in use to burn just bury
Any part because the walk on my hand
Not even not even kick you when your down
Though you wanted something because you
Are living the lonely star
But this is the part where I say goodbye!
(And let the scent of time)
Pull over us say goodbye!
And let the sands of time flow over us

You never had to crawl
You never had to say what it feels like
To be so trapped underneath
The weight of someone's world comes crashing down on me
I was longing to be free i've left a burden in you and me

Are you thinking of are you thinking of me

Does your body still scream my name x2

Trapped with secrets
Til you die to come through with guilt
So your blood is filled

Would I check out the blood

You would never be on the fucking top

From the pain you drive into the heart of me.
The love we share seems to go nowhere,
And I've lost my life,
For I toss and turn, I can't sleep at night.

This tainted love you've given,
I gave you all a boy could give you.
Take my tears and that's not really all...

Now I know I've got to... run away,
I've got to... get away.
You don't really want any more from me.
To make things right you need someone to hold you tight,
And you think love is to pray,
But I'm sorry I don't pray that way.

To win a war is the last thing on their mind

Outcast of society
Trapped inside his lair

Stalking every unlit street
Searching for his prey
Stranger to compassion
Now violence is his way

[Repeat chorus]



",Product of the Past,1988
Atrophy,"[Music: Chris Lykins, Brian Zimmerman]
[Lyrics: Chris Lykins]

Work your ass off every day
Nothing do you own
Sold your soul to the system
Another fucking clone
Never ask for nothing
Yet you gave and gave
Now you're trapped
Ambitions shattered
Another mindless slave

[Chorus:]
You never asked for anything
And that's exactly what you got
They never cared for you
They're glad to see you rot
Nothing's really yours
It's only mortgages and leases
When you die
Then you rest in pieces
Line their pockets with your labor
You go home in debt
Your children die from malnutrition
Your bosses never wept
They justify the life you lead
A life that's full of pain
You were born to serve your master
Your caste revealed by name

[Repeat chorus]

[Solo: Rick]

Sick of their oppression
You come to take what's your
Rip their hearts from their body's
Their blood pools on the floor
A smile plays across your lips
Their life breath slowly ceases
Leave their mansion a free man
As they rest in pieces

[Repeat chorus]




",Rest in Pieces,1988
Atrophy,"[Music: Atrophy]
[Lyrics: Chris Lykins]

[Solo: Chris]

Throughout our troubled history
Man's exploited fellow man.
Displaying xenophobic fear that's hard to understand
Centuries ago in Europe things were different than today
Foreigners were treated with respect not disdain
But dreams of power soon crushed this fine ideal
They set across the ocean in search of land to steal
They subjugated natives and stripped them of their rights
Sold them into slavery to demonstrate their might.

Socialized hate
Formed by modern state

[Chorus:]
Can't you see, it's a lie
Don't you know, that they've died
Trapped, by your hate
Stereotyped, convenient
Forced to be subservient
Taught by your state
All you pseudo-christians had yet to have your fun
You called them all subhuman
Justifying what you'd done
You sold them into slavery, every last one that you could
I guess that's only natural when you say its in their blood
Soon the racist theory spread to every colony

The crimes that you committed were for everyone to see
Depleted all their hunting grounds and chopped down hallowed woods
Set your plantations on the land
Where they once stood

[Chorus:]
Socialized hate
Formed by modern state

[Solo: Rick]

The hatred that you planted is still with us today
No longer simply slavery manifests in different ways
Keeps people in dead end jobs, reduces education
Maintain our racial sterotypes, encourages segregation
You propagate injustice saying they've done it to themselves
You lock them in your ghettos,
Deny them any wealth
The dogma you've created makes sure you never see
That underneath a different color
They're just like you and me
Socialized hate
Formed by modern state




",Socialized Hate [Multimedia Track],1988
Atrophy,"[Music and lyrics: Chris Lykins]

Man builds his world, forms it from rock, steel and clay
His view of nature is that it stands in the way
Visions of profit dance in every landlords head
13 in two rooms, four in every bed

[Chorus:]
Man-made paradise
Falls into decay
Desperate humans
Trapped in their own cage
Look out the window not a free to be seen
They just block traffic, man is forced to intervene
Hiding in darkness, fearing for his life
Man's lost compassion but has replaced it with a knife

[Chorus:]

[First solo: Chris]
[Second solo: Rick]

Desperate children turn to drugs for their fun
Bodies inhabit the morgue claimed by no one
Hiding in shadows, their lives reduced to a lie
Freedom forgotten, no one hears your cry

[Repeat chorus]




",Urban Decay,1988
Atrophy,"Talk about humanity, what's wrong and what is right
You take a human being and strip them of their life
A tormented soul, trapped and left to decay
In a controlled environment to die in a demented way
Death row, he's awating, time just drags by
Gas chamber awaits for him to pay for his crime
When will the madness end, will it be today
What terrible thoughts living day by day

Chorus:
The crime was committed, forever left condemned
Left and forgotten, the fortune never ends
Sentenced to death, delayed for seventeen years
Left to go insane now death's his greatest fear

15 thousand dollars monthly that we pay
To keep him alive, now that's insane
Injustice prevails again, it's the American way
No wonder we're in debt, why do we have to pay
If the death penalty exists to make these convicts pay
Kill them when convicted instead of awaiting
To wait seventeen years is totally inhumane
The crime has lost its meaning, it's ruthless to be so vain

Repeat chorus
Solo: Skowron
Repeat first verse
Repeat chorus



",Forgotten But Not Gone,1990
Atrophy,"In their eyes of children is a world I wish could be
Their definitions of this life derived so simply
There's no one to huert them and everything is fair
The cruelty around them seems hidden from their stare

Chorus:
In their eyes I see a world where every man is free
In their eyes I see a better place for you and me
In their eyes I see a world where no one has to die
In their eyes I see a place where there's never need to lie

But as they grow this vision changes with every passing year
Each misconception lost with shedding of a tear
A world that once seemed safe is revealed to be so cold
In a world disfigured by simply growing old

Repeat chorus
Solo: Lykins

The simple definitions of this world you think you know
Will surely start to cramble as your youthful body grows
Love for you is simple, it supplies you with your needs
In our world it's lethal for it bites the hand that feeds

Repeat chorus
Solo: Skowron



",In Their Eyes,1990
Atrophy,"Our forefathers came with a vision and dream, to settle on this land
They built a great nation with blood and sweat, to benefit all of man
A path of destruction they did not see, they did not understand
Live for the moment instead of the future, typical for all of man

Chorus:
Overpopulation will soon take its toll
The growth of mankind is simply out of control
Soon no where to turn, we run short of precious land
Take our complex problems and place them in our children's hands

Living on a dream, a final prayer, future lies unseen
Hope to make a difference in our lives, its up to you and me
Destroying ourselves day by day, can we change at all
Hope for the best and keep on fighting before we take a fall

Repeat chorus

In the past, wars were benifical, man's its only enemy
Without this devastation we have inequality
People live longer thatn yeasterday, their offspring on the rise
It's mordern science, will it be answer or will it be our demise

Repeat chorus
Solo: Skowron
Repeat third verse
Repeat chorus



",Process of Elimination,1990
Atrophy,"Locked away, I'm hidden from your sight
Forced to live in artificial light
Made to suffer because of what I'm not
A casualty in a war that must be fought
So here I wait like the ones that came before
And when I'm gone they'll need a thousand more
You've decided that my life is yours to take
So now I'm trapped in a world I did not make

[Chorus:]
Let me go
Leave me be
Stop your tests
Set me free

In my cell, I'm waiting for your test
What hidden law makes you better than the rest
You feed me drugs and see what you have made
Day by day situation growing worse
You weren't content to let neture take its course
Now you suffer by the toxins that you use
Terrified by the fate that you helped choose

[Repeat chorus]
[Solo: Skowron]
[Repeat verse]
[Repeat chorus]





",Puppies and Friends,1990
Atrophy,"Trapped in my mind, the answers you won't find
Deep despair, what I feel, lost in time, what I'm feeling
Emotions lost all meaning, can not help what I'm feeling
Tortured by pain, this agony is so insane

Chorus:
Diminishing away, day by day
A life once fulfilling now stripped away
It it's certain I must die
I deserve the right to die
Thousands of dollars everyday
To keep me suffering in a life of pain
I lie rotting be disease, eats away piece by pice
Just leave me be

Living through this Hell, life unravels, just as well
Politics of man won't let me die, they just prolong my demise
A life I did not choose, but it is certain I will lose
A disgrace to myself it I take my family through this hell

Repeat chorus
Solo: Lykins
Repeat first verse
Repeat chorus



",Right to Die,1990
Atrophy,"At the age of 15 your life is defined, it's measured in ounces and grams
The wisdom of ages is soon pushed away for a crystal that's purchased in drams
No time for book learning, the street is your school, it teaches a lesson that's real
You shun lit and science, that's crap for your parents, the only thing real is the deal

Chorus:
Words on a page, they're so hard to read
The will to learn, it's not in your creed
Why should I care, I reeally can't see
The teaching of man, they mean nothing to me

Sports is the answer that's what you've been told,
It's the only way you'll succeed
A ball is your teacher, replaces the textbook,
It's the only tool that you'll need
History and math are soon pushed away by the glory bestowed by a sport
The classroom's forgotten, their teachings outdated,
You live by the rules of the court

Repeat chorus
Solo: Skowron
Solo: Lykins

Although things aren't perfect, they're trying their best,
The choice is left up to you
Resist the temptation of the easy way out,
The promises made just aren't true
You've made your decision have given up trying
And now there is no turning back
Another statistic for our failing system,
Another that's slipped through the cracks

Repeat chorus



",Slipped Through the Cracks,1990
Atrophy,"Forced to deal with decisions you never thought come true
Abandoned by the ones you've trusted, no one's there for you
Internal maelstrom of confusion, unsure of who you are
The things you used in definition didn't take you very far

Chorus:
The things I felt before I'm not sure if they're there
Words which meant so much fall on ears which just don't care
Emotions all entangled, it's time to reearrange
The seasons pass, emotions die, I'm helpless as things change

We often times define ourselves by our titles and our friends
We place our trust in fallacies which eventually will end
But just like dreams that fade away with every morning's light
We're left with only memories, no tangibles in sight

Repeat chorus
Solo: Lykins

Now I find I'm all alone and wondering what is real
Insecure of who I am, afraid of what I feel
But I'm on the path to knowledge, the darkness won't last longer
That which does not kill me, only makes me stronger

Repeat chorus

Things change
Things change
Things change
Things change



",Things Change,1990
Atrophy,"Intro solo: Skowron
Solo: Lykins

Sometime at an early age a strange call beckoned you
It urged you on to selfishness and told you what to do
It taught you thr word trust was just a tool that you could use
To manipulate your target make them do what you would choose
And still the call kept haunting you as you raced toward the end
You went through life with blinders on, no chance to make a friend
The call that you had answered is the one that's known as greed
It's tempting lure of empty wealth is one few fail to heed

Chorus:
Too late to change. Too late to change.
Just like a lemming you're blind to your fate
You fail to question until it's too late
Too late to change. Too late to change.
Driven by something you don't understand
Your lack of comassion is killing our land

It made you poison once clear rivers, raze forests to the ground
So you cut your expenses at the expense of those around
You did not care your every touch brought sickness to the land
The only green you care bout is the kind that you can spend
Somehow after all this time you make it to the end
And stare into that darkest void that longs to be your friend
But something deep inside of you resists the need to quit
You realize that only emptiness resides within the pit

Repeat chorus
Solo: Skowron
Solo: Lykins

You realize the harm you've done and what could yet come true
The crimes that you've committed and what you still can do
The goals you once held dearly now seem very strange
Your new found care for mankind shows it's not too late to change



",Too Late to Change,1990
Atrophy,"Morbid fascination instilled within our young
Raised and weaned on cold steel, the damage it has brung
Little plastic war toys always within reach
Replicas of war, what lessons do they teach

Pre-chorus:
Minimal control, that's why this land is great
Accidental death, the lesson learned too late
Escalating tensions sweeping 'cross our land
A gun beneath your pillow you fail to understand

Images of violence flicker on the screen
Taken in by young eyes unsure of what it means
Violent heritage echoed in their games
Countless shattered lives, no one learns their names

Repeat pre-chorus

Chorus:
Violent by nature (4x)

Solo: Lykins

Children raised on violence, soon no place to run
Setting fights with bullets, the nightmare's just begun
Staring out the window, your child plays with friends
Waving plastic pistols, the circle never ends

Repeat pre-chorus

Donde no hare faltas alas para volar
Sentir
Desde el aire fijé mi atención
En visiones sin explicación
Desbordaba energía
Estallaba en intensidad
Me precipitaba why volvía a volar
Sobre las sierras why el mar
Sobre la ciudad vi mi barrio
El cielo invita a jugar, a no despertar

Yo perdía en el intento
Mi incierta identidad
Amanecía vacilando despertar
Why permanecía en el mismo lugar
Despierto
Pasan los días sin sol
Mi vida es una mueca triste
Me preguntaste porqué
Why no supe hablar
Me siento sin corazón 
Me siento tan incompleto
Mi cuerpo sabe lo que natura non da
No puedo volar aunque lo intente",Onírico,2003

And everywhere you turn
There's vultures and thieves at your back
And the storm keeps on twisting
You keep on building the lie
That you make up for all that you lack
It don't make no difference
Escaping one last time

This glorious sadness, that brings me to my knees

I can see them trying to pick their best disguise

Little people grabbing hold of my arms
I can see that there's a crowd in my way
Little people screaming piercing little words
Happily trying to have their little way

I don't want ever to let their filthy hands take me over
I don't want to let their little dirty hands in my mind
They can't get to me, they can't get to me
They can't get to me, I'm not on their side

Little people trying to cover up my eyes
So I can't see what they want to do to my face
Little people singing, simple little so I will sleep
Trying to get me out of their way

I don't want ever to let their filthy hands take me over
I don't want to let their little dirty hands in my mind

They can't get to me, they can't get to me
They can't get to me, they can't get to me
They can't get to me, they can't get to me
They can't get to me, they can't get to me
They can't get to me, they can't get to me

I don't want ever to let their filthy hands take me over
I don't want to let their little dirty hands in my mind
They can't get to me, they can't get to me
They can't get to me, I'm not on their side

It's too late for, for me to go.

Falling from the fold in my hands.
Did you do this,
With the looks that I don't understand.
Empty kisses, 
Tell me more than any words can say.
That you don't know me,
And you don't feel quite the same for me today.

Attila,"Avevo contro ogni pronostico
Ora sotto chi è il prossimo
Ho un flow che scotta più del cucchiaino di un tossico
Commodo come l’imperatore ne Il Gladiatore
C'è una certa pressione nel mio cercapersone
Fatti di me come fatti di roba
Perché il resto è riciclato come l’olio da McDonald's
Fra’ porta bottiglie a pioggia, è l’età della roccia
Con metà della bocca giù metà della boccia
Ragazze scollate, poco scolarizzate, pollame
Freddo polare, lenti polarizzate e collane
Ho ancora la stessa fame come quando ho iniziato
Punto all'attico perché stavo al piano rialzato
Ogni anno si abbassa l’asticella e non riesco a fare il limbo
Con la testa tocco terra, Number One come la discoteca
Marratoneta e mi fai una sega
Ai miei piedi la scena, ai tuoi piedi De Fonseca

Vorrei vedere le facce
Quando ‘sto suono esploderà
Abbiamo acceso le micce
Ormai ‘sto suono esploderà
Sarà una valle di lacrime

Seduti sopra la lapide

Non ho ancora fatto il cash, non ho a casa la moquette
Piscio nella tua pochette, sei una squillo come Roxanne (ah)
Marra è per un quarto Pelé, per un quarto Maradona e per metà George Best (fra')
Hai la faccia di chi va in bianco
E ha meno rapporti l’anno della bici nel cambio
Cambio, cambio
Io ho la faccia di chi va in banca
Prima di fare un viaggio e chiede a quanto sta il cambio
Bello il G-Shock, bella la tee, belli i jeans (jeans)
Grazie baby, ti lascio il mio Blackberry PIN
Selvaggio, Marra è Huckleberry Finn
Tu mi vedi e fai moonwalk come Michael in Billie Jean
So fresh, so clean, Marracashmere
Ti sposta con un dito solo come il touch screen
Alta quota come un G6
Euro tax free
Sbagli con me è come in Colombia se sbagli taxi

Every time this year
This dark fog will appear
Up from the tombs it comes
To take one more life that can be near
In the middle of Transylvania
All natural life has for a long time ago gone,
It is thin and so beautiful
But also so dark and mysterious

Once again the priest is messing
May the God bless us all
The fog is here again
That will complete this funeral
From a place empty of life
Only dead trees are growing here
As it comes from a far
Only dead trees are growing here

Funeral fog. [4x]

I've come to talk with you again,
Because a vision softly creeping,
Left its seeds while I was sleeping,
And the vision that was planted in my brain
Still remains
Within the sound of silence.
In restless dreams I walked alone
Narrow streets of cobblestone,
'Neath the halo of a street lamp,
I turned my collar to the cold and damp
When my eyes were stabbed by the flash of a neon light
That split the night
And touched the sound of silence.

And in the naked light I saw
Ten thousand people, maybe more.
People talking without speaking,
People hearing without listening,
People writing songs that voices never share
And no one dare
Disturb the sound of silence.

""Fools"" said I, ""You do not know
Silence like a cancer grows.
Hear my words that I might teach you,
Take my arms that I might reach you.""
But my words like silent raindrops fell,
And echoed
In the wells of silence

And the people bowed and prayed
To the neon god they made.
And the sign flashed out its warning,
In the words that it was forming.
And the sign said, ""The words of the prophets

Are written on the subway walls
And tenement halls.""
And whisper'd in the sounds of silence.",The Sound of Silence,2002

Attilo Zanchi,"Somewhere over the rainbow, way up high
There's a land that I've heard of once in a lullaby.
Somewhere over the rainbow, skies are blue
And the dreams that you dare to dream,
Really do come true.

Someday I'll wish upon a star
And wake up where the clouds are far behind me.
Where troubles melt like lemon drops,
High above the chimney tops,
That's where you'll find me.

Somewhere over the rainbow, blue birds fly
Birds fly over the rainbow
Why then, oh why can't I?
If happy little bluebirds fly beyond the rainbow
Why, oh why can't I?

Somewhere over the rainbow, way up high
There's a land that I've heard of once in a lullaby.
Somewhere over the rainbow, skies are blue
And the dreams that you dare to dream,
Really do come true.

Someday I'll wish upon a star
And wake up where the clouds are far behind me.
Where troubles melt like lemon drops,
High above the chimney tops,
That's where you'll find me.

Wake up and kiss my baby, grab my weed and my gun
Load and cock it & blaze one up, that's how it be on the run
More money more problems, no money yo problems ain't gone die
Put 5 in the tank, I'm high & I'm bad news, don't ask me for no ride
When I look at my daughter & son & I see me in their eyes
It hurt so bad I hope the mistakes I made will keep them alive
I keep pushin looking for a lick to hit shit I need some cheese
Gotta go no sleepin for me momma I gotta leave
And if god is on my side then one day soon I'll get where I gotta be
I'm free ain't nothin gone stop me from seein what I gotta see
Not even me
The day I cop a ?? gone be the day that I can't even breathe
All the shit that I go through, if I could show you, you wouldn't believe
All I got is my Bible & me and this rifle my last name ain't Mavoe
I'm just a survivor
Been gone from home so long some folks thank that I died
It's cool and If I don't get rich I'm thankful that I alive besides

I got a warrant out for me, and I'm walkin a thin line

I got a (sniff) warrant out for me & I'm walkin a thin line

[Bubba]
It's strictly for survival this time
Still I do not want what's yours unless it's rightfully mine
It really just ain't no words at least that I can define
For how I feel lord please some sight to the blind
Cause I'm scrambling down the same road
Travelin in the same clothes 
Feelin 2 million days old can't let all this take hold
'cause see I always saw myself as just a little more special than
These sappy crappy no rappin whoever's collectin fans
I'm doin the best I can I just need a better plan
I still ain't in peace with flyin 'cause my plane has yet to land
I'm runnin & runnin my stomach's grumbling but I ain't
Hungry enough that I'm just disgusted because I can't
Ever make what I thank translate into what I say
Unless I pour this Vodka in that big cup & chug away
I want to just run away from what I've become today
A rebel with a warrant & his name is say Bubba K.

[Timbaland's chorus]

[Bubba]
This is heart it ain't a verse pick yo fruit name yo curse
With all the pain that is life dyin hurts lyin's worse
Drive my Hearst down 85 to momma's house in LaGrange
Drop me off on the porch then send my off in a plane
Forget my name 'till God arrives to show all y'all what Bubba meant
To tamper with how we wrote the script clearly don't make fuckin sense
There's not a thing that's pure to me it's contaminated by your device
Cause a wise man once said eternity's and let go of life

Hey why'all, it's Timbaland with the jump off
I only got forty eight hours before my plane takes off
I got this girl ready to give me some face off
I think I need seven just to make the playoff

But I ain't gonna hit tonight, I'ma leave a good impression before I catch my flight (come on)
How I'm wrong when you ain't right?
When your dumbass will be right on my flight (stupid)
There goes my shenanigans, laugh with me

There ain't no need for panicking
Chill out, you on a private plane
Just lay your head back to this kirkle bang
Eat some peanuts, sip on some champagne

Your fly mileage go up as you give me brain
This is what Thomas do, piss on my mark then I get back to you

'Cause I'm leaving on the next plane
I don't know when I'll be back again
Why don't you just call up all your friends
And let's get something started

[Verse: Attitude]
I'm only in town for two days, two nights only
I'm hoping that you want to spend these two nights on me
I like your home girls you like my homies
We ain't really tryna spend these two night lonely

Shawty, really ain't much I'm asking for
A little conversation, a nice piece of ass to go
I like penetration, how you like it fast or slow?
Only a hip, nobody has to know

She looking at me, weighing up her options
She ready to leave, and go get it poppin'
What could be the fact that I got there
Drop top Benz or that single in the top 10?

I dunno but whatever it is gotta::crunk
She grabbing her liquor, coming out of Prada
I told her I'ma pimp it, I ain't coming out a dollar
Let's go! I'm leaving gonna be out of here tomorrow

[Chorus: x 2]

[Verse: Magoo]
Girl you lookin' right in those jeans
You been eating colligreens?
That's obscene, your man don't help you make beans?
You have a house, 2 kids, and he working

There's rumors, he and your best friend been flirting
But I ain't tryna fuck you tonight
Your ass big, but your face hmmmm that look alright
I tell you what, I'ma make an exception

Clothes off, that's the truth
Clothes on is deception
Aw, yea, a macilent conception
Front or the back, hit in any direction

And baby you the cause of my erection
Stop at Wal-Greens I'ma buy some protection
Fuck that, go and put it in my face girl
I really have a need to give you face girl

You said you dreamed if sex with a star
Make up your mind, Oo be on a jet tomorrow

Attitude,"What they say what they say what they say

You speak out all you feel is defiance
All you need is some self-reliance
Cuz this world is gonna always try us
And all you wanted was to run for cover
Well here's looking to yourself and no other 
We're all searching for that special something 
And we keep on running

We all have the choice to take the lead or follow 
I want to feel the light shine on me

You're so afraid of what people might say 
But that's okay cuz you're only human 
You're so afraid of what people might say 
But that's okay you'll soon get strong enough 
You're so afraid of what people might say 
But that's okay cuz you're only human 
You're so afraid of what people might say you're going to break so please don't do it

You wanna spread your wings but you're not sure 
Don't wanna leave your comforts 
Wanna find a cure 
We're afraid of who we see in the mirror 
We wanna let go but it feels too pure 
Who wants to be alone in this world 
You look around and all you see is hurt 
But the light it always guides us 
If we move with a little trust

A diamond don't define what shine is
I don't need a Rolex to know what the time is 
You got yours let me find what mine in 
I'm a survivor look how strong my mind is 
I stand on my own it's all me 
Regardless of whatever they call me 
I'm a leader not a follower 
And I'd rather be paid and popular

I run this shit; they just chase my ass
I ain't talkin' shit, nigga
Just tellin' the facts
I think all the tracks I'm hearin' from niggas is whack
I be hearin' these niggas
What they say in they rhymes
I took my spot; nobody gave me mine
I make the beats that boom boom boom in they trunks
You disagree, homey? Then go on and jump
You can bump your gum
You can say what you want

Smoking water damaged cigarettes
Observe as he works your wasteland
Pulling punches that you never met

Controlled in a listless air stream
Jets are breathing in his latex eyes
True to form, he is scared to touch them
And your wasteland stays vandalized

Success in a cut glass wardrobe
All the clothes loose like shredded hair
Dream escapes to a closet class war
King mob in a smashed wheel chair

Nerve gas for the walking wounded
Suffocating in a sadists' prayer
Flaming horses on a fading landscape
Break the surface but there is no air

King mob as he vents his anger
Throws a brick through the city gates
Backfires on his wordless offspring
The population disintegrates

Cold stream plus a wash of carbon
Drives his mind like an engine room
Cogs turning like a flawed stage whisper
King mob sings a lifeless tune

Surface stop
Pressure drop
King mob

Faded wrists and the risks worth taking
Cleans his blade with dreams he froze
Metal moments fed on foreign textures
Breaks his mind with the things he knows

King mob at his withered console
Electric arcades run on secret oils
Flicks a switch and he's the God of anger
Pulls a handle and the wasteland spoils

He found you on top of your desk asleep

But life is another man's treasure
If he's given it up to christ

God said it all when he gave the world his only son
To die on the cross

There's hope for all mankind
Just give it to him
And you can't find life more abundantly

Aubrey Haynie,"The drinking dens are spilling out
There's staggering in the square
There's lads and lasses falling about
And a crackling in the air

Down around the dungeon doors
The shelters and the queues
Everybody's looking for
Somebody's arms to fall into

   And it's what it is
It's what it is now

There's frost on the graves and the monuments
But the taverns are warm in town
People curse the government
And shovel hot food down

The lights are out in city hall
The castle and the keep
The moon shines down upon it all
The legless and asleep

And it's cold on the tollgate
With the wagons creeping through
Cold on the tollgate
God knows what I could do with you
It's what it is
It's what it is now

The garrison sleeps in the citadel
With the ghosts and the ancient stones
High up on the parapet
A Scottish piper stands alone

And high on the wind
The highland drums begin to roll
And something from the past just comes
And stares into my soul

And it's cold on the tollgate
With the Caledonian blues
Cold on the tollgate
God knows what I could do with you

And it's what it is
It's what it is now
What it is
It's what it is now

There's a chink of light, there's a burning wick
There's a lantern in the tower
Wee Willie Winkie with a candlestick
Still writing songs in the wee wee hours

On Charlotte Street I take
A walking stick from my hotel
The ghost of Dirty Dick
Is still in search of Little Nell

Well I heard ole Neil put her down

When it's all too late
It's all too late
I did not have the time
I did not have the nerve
To ask you how you feel
Is this what you deserve
When it's all too late
It's all too late
Change
You can change
And something on your mind
Became a point of view
You lost your honesty
I lost the life in you
When it's all too late
It's all too late
We walk and talk in time
I walk and talk in two
Where does the end of me
Become the start of you
When it's all too late
It's all too late
What has happened to
The friend that I once knew
Has he gone away

Baby girl I know that you've been off track. 
You feel like taking one step forwards, you're taking two back. 
No how matter how hard you try things always go bad. 
The thought of a better life, you'll never know that. 
You smile on the out but inside you hurt,
You say that you're fine,but you feel unsure. 
Try to replace the pain by saying false words. 
You see that girl in the mirror but don't know her. 

But the tears can't wash away,
All the fears you haven't faced. 
Baby girl don't lose your faith cause' the storm don't last always. 

[Chorus]
This goes out to my home-girls. 
Know it's hard to make it in this world. 
I know you try and it feels like nothing goes right. 
But it will be alright. 
This one goes out to my homies trying to survive out in these streets. 
I know it's tough, forced to grow up, life isn't as rough, now keep your head up. 

Baby boy the streets is all that you. 
You dream of a higher place instead you stay low. 
You go home at night and your all alone. 
Wanna call out to your boys but their all gone. 
You tell yourself that you don't need no one else. 
But if only. 
You will try, won't get lonely, won't have to hide what your feeling. 

But the tears can't wash away,
All the fears you haven't faced. 
Baby boy don't lose your faith cause' the storm don't last always.

A bell tolls for my heart and then my lonesome song begins
It's marching through my door now, the stony cold of lonesome

AuDen,"On a compté les lendemains
Qui nous restaient mais incertains
On s'est perdu sur un chemin
Une inconnue dans le refrain
De grands sourires n'y changeraient rien
Car le début jouait la fin

À l'origine on n'était rien
Juste une ébauche ou un dessin
Des rêves suivis de petits points
Au coin des rues un doux parfum
Suprême idylle main dans la main
De belles photos on se souvient

Puisqu'on se perd pour mieux s'unir
Puisqu'on ne tient plus au présent
Le moindre souffle nous détruit
Et nous disperse avec les vents

Comme fous alliés, comme deux enfants
Comme une fleur à son printemps
On fuyait l'ombre pour mieux s'étendre
Sur nos nuages en évidence
Comblés d'amour et d'innocence
Aux souvenirs de nos vingt ans

Si on s'accorde un peu de temps
Pour réfléchir tout simplement
Avant de n'être que des perdants
Au goût amer qui s'en ressent
Avant l'orage qui lui n'attend
Au grand jamais le temps d'attendre

Puisqu'on se perd pour mieux s'unir
Puisqu'on ne tient plus au présent
Le moindre souffle nous détruit
Et nous disperse avec les vents

Tous ces mensonges que l'on déguise
Nous laissent un beau jour sans défense
Puisqu'on se perd pour mieux s'unir
Puisque l'on s'aime toujours autant",Pour Mieux S'Unir,2014
Audible,"Everything is rising again
The things I thought were dead
The past is trying to breath
To tear apart this life

Everything is dying away
Against my dying will
Against my dying cries
The world is turning red

I see no pain
I feel no pain
Until the end
To wake beneath the rain

I know nothing lasts so long
My patience waits
I feel no remorse
I know no pain

Beneath this, beneath this there once was hope
There once was warmth
Just one word, just one prayer is all I need
To save me from myself

We swore to believe so no matter the chance we sing

Raise the banner high march with I and I
Lift your voices up loud and high

Let the battle rage on we cry

Here we come, and we’re lifting praise
Our battle cry, is giving thanks
Hear the people sing Hallelujah
His mercy reigns, His word is true

Put the armies in the back and the singers in the front
We swore to believe so no matter the chance we sing

We put our weapons down
Whom shall we fear, no one, no one

Simon, what do you mean?
I've got a plan, it'll all be clean?
Got the joints and the beats rolling
Got the tunes on the decks strolling

As I walk through my mind
All my thoughts are behind
When there's deals being signed
And there's walls getting climbed

And there's things that we bring
When we fling with the sing
And we want to be in
From the start to the fin

Is it me, is it them?
Is it you or your friends?
There's no need to pretend
That your mind's on the mend

Is the past in your eyes
Are your hands on your thighs?
'Cause you cannot disguise
That you needed a rise

If I had the time then I'd spend a little more with you
And if I had a 100 million then I'd probably give half to you

Lord of the standard, lord of the landlords
I've been living on the shores of the Canyon
Pretty girls and ugly guys
Twisted dreams and purple skies

Back to basics, forward to basics
Norms are day trips, minds are brain tripped
What's the main lick? What's the main trip?
It's like this

For all my fellas that sip the Stellas
DJ's, Grafters and drug sellers
To the geeks, there's no need to be jealous
We're just doing our thing

If I had the time then I'd spend a little more with you
And if I had a 100 million then I'd probably give half to you

I just don't know about the way
I just wished I had some more days in my book
Call you up and give you a look

If I had the time then I'd spend a little more with you
And if I had a 100 million then I'd probably give half to you

From the edge of the land, who's that man?
Doing things that you can't understand
Broken or fixed, token or tripped
How many things we can throw in the mix?

Two thousand sales into two
Coming through, it's the Audio Crew
Don't bother doing if it don't sound smooth

Audio Bullys,"Not too long ago in a land called London 
I was feeling low and my life came undone
I didn't even have a penny to my name, 
My minutes in the hours were just floatin' down the drain
So I started to think with the drink in the pub, 
That I could be pursuing other stuff
'Cause I told you take the rough with the smooth, now listen to the groove

Time gets past it, the feeling lasted, 
Music blasted but nothing past its stone, 
Gonna get my own, now we're in the zone
Everything's a mist to me and everything's a mystery
The things in life you wish to be
We're leaving it to history
Better catch this life 'cause its floatin' past, 

We're in the game and we're in to last, 
No one knows when fate gets past, 
If I'm gonna go I'm goin' out with a blast
Gotta sort it out but your shit 
Just turned away, just turned away girl, just turned away
Tryna' sort my problems out from day-to-day,
From day to day girl, from day to day

Then there were the days went no where at all 
But then I started sprayin' on the trains and the walls
Got a girl and my life got better, 
Left a few men feelin 'bit better
So pretty and her eyes were green, 
Felt proud to bring her out on the scene
About a year I was with her for 

And when we broke it left me quite sore
So I clicked my heels and kept walking, 
Seen another that I like, now we're talking
Well if there's a boat to the sun, I tell you every one wants on
If life for you has just begun, there's summer at the end of the run
So when the summer days blaze on, 
Sip a beer and look to the sun and keep it ninety-eight percent fun, 

Be glad when your life times done, one
Gotta sort it out but your shit just turned away, 
Just turned away girl, just turned away
Tryna' sort my problems out from day-to-day, 
From day to day girl, from day to day
Wake up early and my eyes are glazed, 
Reminiscing all them old school days

When I spent every day in a haze, 
Looking out for your loved ones pays
New Era, new serial number,
When I wake from slumber, hear the thunder rumble, 
Don't tumble, Frank's in the jungle
Grey cells automatically tell tails, 
From Ireland to Wales, wind in my sails

Sun on my face and when I'm gone there won't be no trace
Captivate, demonstrate, its about time to castrate
The truth from the fiction, feel the friction burns
As we learn to take turns, now listen to my terms, 
'Cause every single one in the world gotta turn
We're leaving you third degree burns, as the wheel of fortune turns

Gotta sort it out but your shit just turned away, 
Just turned away girl, just turned away.
Tryna' sort my problems out from day-to-day, 
From day to day girl, from day to day
Gotta sort it out but your shit just turned away, 
Just turned away girl, just turned away.
Tryna' sort my problems out from day-to-day, 

From day to day girl, from day to day
If shit gets bad you're gonna pull out of it, 
Think twice if you've got any doubts with it
'Cause it's not about pain in this life we live in
Let the chapter begin
Keep on graspin' keep on lastin', 
Make the future better than the past's been

Live everyday 'cause it could be your last on, 
Now you're tied to the mast son
22 years in the land called London, 
Been dark been bright been fun son.
This is for my peers in the land called London, 
Got your back when your world comes undone
Seen a few deaths and tragedies

I know there souls are a-float on the breeze, so for you 
I'm burning some trees, can't ever forget the deceased

Some bodies tryna' look out for a some one

My home was broken to
When the door was open
I was out and smokin'
I didn't look for trouble
Trouble looked for me
But that'd be a lie you'd see
Me and trouble got along just fine
Out getting pissed on the beer and the wine
It didn't take long before I met people just like me
Feel plot and foxy
We made a little team, if you know what I mean
Checked a few scenes
Seen a few fiends
Sprayed a few trains
Played a few games
Hung around with faces and names
Went out with pretty young dames
Young love and young flames

It's alright, just keep on moving

Wasn't nothing but sorrow in the house
I wasn't there
I went out
With the boys just hanging about
Playing round and acting like louts
In them days overcoming our doubts
Serving up just to keep a little clout
Ploty introduced me to stealing
I knew ol' mothers words now had lost their meaning
Just stole paint to put up my name
Pretty soon it all seemed the same
So this was my brand new game
Stone island, and Ralph Lauren
That's what we were wearing then
I loved them days so I look back again
The club scene was banging at the time
House and garish, pills and white lines
Kurosawa little strain on the mind

We were fine

Wear you away
Pacing holes in linoleum
Stuck in a rut
Still love him too much
Hard to believe
How far down you have come

Bottle to glass
Glass to your mouth
A ritual you've grown
Accustomed to these days
Windows no lights
Alone in a room
The afternoon sun abandons you

You're frozen stuck in the past
'cause nothing good seems to last
You broke down somewhere along
'Cause nothing good lasts very long.

Your children all raised
No one to tend
You burned all the bridges
With all of your friends who
Stood by your side
In sorrow and hate
You've driven them
Driven them all away

You're frozen stuck in the past
'Cause nothing good seems to last
Afraid you'll fade till you're gone
'Cause nothing good lasts very long

You make the worst
Of everything you
Childhood dreams that never came
Still can't accept
He up and left you
Wedding vows still remember the day

Your children raised
No one to listen
Pull the drapes shutting out the sun
You pour yourself - yourself another
While the out - the outside world
Moves on leaving you behind

Looping it inside your head
'til it becomes frayed
Stuck in a rut
Minutes turn hours into days



",Broken,2002
Audio Learning Center,"I remember it was mid-December
I was walking you home
And we stopped to make angels
In the snow
I remember the way the breath
Erupted from your lips
I couldn't quite get up the nerve
To give you that kiss",December,2002
Audio Learning Center,"My hate for you
Grows with every day
With every lie that
You've chose to tell

I've come undone
Lord I've become

With every night
I lay awake
From the medications
That I'm on now

I've come unglued
And I blame you

This goes out to
You know who...



",A Dedication,2002
Audio Learning Center,"I never made the dream
Was just too far out of reach
And though I want it still
Not sure it ever will

God how I miss you
Another seven weeks until
I called you on the phone
But you weren't at home

Pulling out your photograph
So many things
I wish I'd said

I passed through my home town
One of the few that made it out
Nothing has changed
It stayed the same

I ran into an ex-friend
We never had made amends
And after all these years
Things still are weird

There wasn't much - much to say
Friendships often fade away

Been trying to write
This letter to you
Disjointed thoughts
Just can't seem to
Get them to display back
What I want them to
Crumpled failures
Litter the room



",The Dream,2002
Audio Learning Center,"I've got my own religion
I make it up as I go along
I've got this friend
Who says he's been born again
And if he's right
We don't have long

My doctor gave me a prescription
With unlimited refills
Supposed to make all my days
Exactly the same
I'm in perfect health
With my pink pill

They tell me I'm doing better now
I'm no longer a danger to myself
Besides the occasional side-effect
They tell me that I should
Do pretty well

They've informed me that
I'm being released
And soon I'll be free to go home
Though they know
I've got no place to go
New budget cuts just won't allow

They tell me I'm doing better now
It's a game of think but do not tell
As long as I take my medicine
They tell me that I should
Do pretty well.

Once I finish writing out
These thoughts to you
I'm gonna pack up all my personals
And go back to where we used
I wonder if you're
Around there anymore

The voices in my head
The bad thoughts that I used to get
An occasional side effect
As long as I take my medicine

I'm doing
They say I'm doing well

My doctor gave me a prescription

Reppin rojo on Jimmy Kimmel had some disturbed
But niggas know that we ruff and rugged so mums the word
Tech N9na face painted look like he come ta purge!
Real scorpio, shoot this thing like a Torpedo
Rock the rip, no remorse we go
Dummy like Mork from Ork, we know
And I say that with the utmost respect
I bust low to death, I must bode the check
It's never enough, no for Tech
So I get sick with it, I make a bitch dig it
Even when I wanna speed it up and I quick-spit it
I get a bit wicked up in a battle
Tryin to bite a buck, I blabber in his fitted
Killin' music get me spiff sitted, I can't piss when it become hard
So I need a chick to hit it when I kick a lyric
And I'mma murder 'til I'm on the yard (Murder)
My verbs are like birds that jerk up and merk the weak twerps
You can't hurt the durka
First to, insert the work inside of the earth
I disperse the curse to reverse ya to the worst of ya venomous
Squirt ya mercer (Ugh)
Trip not, you see I got the advantage in hip hop
Cause rappers sound identical so when N9na's shit drop
I do numbers, I'm the pinnacle so never will it stop
Y'all can't beat me doin' nothing, except for
Stalkin' these thoughts I spew and suckin'
We run this independent game, it ain't no screwin' us
When we runnin' everything except our mouth while they blue and sufferin'

I wanna try to kill everything in my way

He needed assistance from the group with the best rhymes
That spit the heat up off of yo ass and grind
Fuck all of them flex rhymes
I get love in every city I sack in cause I rep mine
Around the world, the girls give me head on tour cause I headline
I gotta get fed, I'm fed up, my homies is doin' fair time
I look at that clock and all I see is ""Go get that bread"" time
Lost too many soldiers so tears, I gotta shed mine
Turn on the radio, hear yo shit, and oh, it's bedtime
I fall asleep, it all is weak, most y'all shouldn't be called MCs
Bro, ya discography, you ain't sale cause all of ya talk is cheap
Smoke up all the tree, my whip look like it got a fog machine
My crib look like a pharmacy, that's prolly why you wanna haul my team

Livin' facetious, what the hell, why the weed lit
I make change where I see fit
I don't play like I don't see shit
Yeah, one hunnit, one hunnit, keep it that way and it's a poem
And stay away from the hate and keep all yo plays right in motion
Bust it, I'm down after the sun and up before it, better know it
MVP, most valuable poet, been the coldest, kept it focused
Cause you miss every goal that you don't shoot for
And every time you cut a corner, you make two more
The rich is in my life, so I don't have to have the things
And listen for the whispers so I don't have to hear the screams
And I go hard for what I want, so it's just colors when I dream
And then you realize, it's not as scary as it seems
Molly's for pussies

I wanna give, give it all
I said, I said, I said, I said
I wanna try to kill everything in my way
Everybody say, hey, ey, ey, ey, ey!

Ain't nobody handle me, heated like a candle be
Kissin' dirt, ya man'll be for tryin' to dismantle me
Music is my weapon, true, loud enough to deafen you
Never trip with Tech and crew, be careful who you steppin' to

Audio Two,"I, always hated hickeys all around my neck
But it was feelin pretty good so what, the heck
The hickey went on, and I went home
I tried to brush it off then I used a comb
The comb didn't work it got bigger, and redder
Giz said, ""Yo Milk man you shouldn'ta let her""
But I did Giz, and now I gotta get it off
I tried lotion but it just got soft
The hours went on, and on, and on
Man - I wish the hickey was gone
But it wasn't, and, my girl was comin over
I needed a plan, to try to get over
So I called King of Chill I said, ""What's up man?
Got a hickey on my neck, I need a plan""
He said, ""Yo Milk why don't you bust a turtleneck?""
I said that's wack but what, the heck
I ran to my room but I couldn't find one
Then like Star Trek, _The Search_ begun
I ran through my house from the bottom to the top
I got a bright idea, I'll ask pop
I ran to dad, I said, ""What's up D?
I need a turtleneck, to cover this hickey""
He said, ""Oh son that just won't work;
you'll feel real hot and you'll look like a jerk""
I said, ""Okay - then what's your advice?""
He said, ""Go into the freezer, and get a piece of ice""
I said a piece of ice, to put on my neck?
It sounds real cold but what, the heck
I went into the freezer, and did what he said
I hope it would 'ork, or else I'd be dead
I put the ice on and I waited, and waited
The hickey was gone - it faded, it faded
The time was then for my girl to appear
At the count of three, what did I hear?

One
Two
Three

It was the bell, as you can tell
As I opened the door, my eyes did swell
As I, saw somethin' I thought I never would see

I punched her in the mouth her lip I did wreck

Yo, my name is Milk, when Milk is on the mic
I say all the rhymes you MC's hate
I really don't care what you think or say
I gotta bust a rhyme in my own special way
Giz is my brother, mom is my mother
Dee is my father, you say why bother?
Because they put me here on this earth
Lyte is on my side and she is worth
more to me than you, forget your crew
It doesn't matter what you say, or what you do
I'll keep on rockin, I roll too quick
All you groupies make me sick
The King is my boy cause he's down with us
First Priority's the label, that we trust
I really don't care if you're big and bad
I'm makin more money than you wish you had
Girls step up if they know what time it is
The left to Milk, the right to Giz
I never throw a mic cause I have respect
And when I come, I come correct
To my left to my right I have bodyguards
And in my wallet, credit cards
In my pockets, hundreds, and more
I give it to your mother, cause your mother's - a stunt
I really don't care if you're gettin mad
I call you son, son, you call me dad
I never take drugs, I like to drink
milk, it helps me grow and think
like a champ, suckers I vamp
Soggy MC's will always stay damp
In my presence, and in my residence
I keep keys to my car, I go real far
to pick up my money
I think it's dope, you think it's fun-ny

(*sample of Milk saying ""I don't care"" repeats w/ variations*)

[Milk]
But, you, never ever bothered a brother like me
I have too much personality
When I produce, you say it's def
I'll pan it right then I'll pan it left
If I want I keep it right in the middle
You look puzzled, it isn't a riddle
It's, a rhyme, one, of mine
One of a kind, girls say we're fine
What's on your mind, you said I'm through?
You must be stupid, the Audio Two
is here to stay, every day
It doesn't matter what you think or what you say
We'll keep on rockin, keep on shockin
You'll keep lookin, starin, and mockin
Milk style, my brother
You're, a fighter, I'm, a lover
And when I'm at a jam I'm always undercover
Unless I get paid then I do, a show
When I'm finished, I always go
I got speakers, the size of your girl
Boomin the room an', shakin your world
Bigfoot feet are very big
If you're a sucker he'll help you dig
your grave, or maybe he'll save your life
Mike shot the sherriff, I took your wife
Yeah you look mean but it don't mean nuttin
You got dissed with the push of a button
You paid your quarter but the game didn't start
It broke your money and it broke your heart
I stepped up and the game, begins
In this situation I surely win
I am the Milk like the milk you drink
I don't care what you say or what you think
I'll keep on movin, keep on slayin
Groovin MC's that think I'm playin
On, the mic, my style, you like
If you don't then leave..
And I'll end this jam with time to breathe, boy!

Who's clockin ducats while you're partyin?

Over with and done, never to return

Looking for a cause
And never really sure
Nothing but a hole
To live without a soul
And nothing to be learned

People go insane
I can show you how
You could do the same
I can tell you why
The end will never come
I can tell you I'm
A shadow on the sun

Move behind my eyes
Doors inside my head
Bolted from within
Every drop of flame
Lights a candle in
Memory of the one
Who lives inside my skin

You're runnin' without love""

Ladies man
Met down at the laundromat
And tried to make me
Understand

The neighbors were
All in a stir
About what they might have heard
And runnin' down they shouted out
It seemed

Next door a girl she lives
About the same age as me
And asked me to come upstairs
For a see

Just then her mother burst in
Said, ""You're the son of that bitch in the wind
Get outta my house
Hit the road""
I kept fallin' like a Rolling Stones song
I'm going straight to hell
Just like my mama said
I'm going straight to hell

The stars came out
And warned me so
As I walked on down
The road
Fifty bucks and a suitcase
Steered me clear

She took my hand
As we walked into the sun
A new days promise had
Begun
We'll make it alone
Whether you like it or not
I turned and shouted

Help me mother
I'm going straight to hell
Just like my mama said
I'm going straight to hell

Love her
Won't you let me go",Straight To Hell,2010

Blow your socks off, make sure your G spots off.

More flesh than a Greek fest, roll up the incense, 
Pass the Hennesey, put my body to the test.

I was a young girl listenin' to a higher flow, 
Now here's my chance to hit you off,

This is rock bottom why yall, I never expected it
In order to be businesslike you must meet the prerequisite
Leave your culture at home, smile, don't be too proud, too wild
You may suffer, just don't cry out loud
This notion of professionalism is like an exorcism
Forced to give your life away while you're earnin' a livin'
These thoughts had stopped me from rejoinin' the work force
But now the situation I'm in, just seems to hurt more
Maybe it won't be bad, maybe it'll be good
I could use a little structure in my life, maybe I should
Take my suit and tie out of the closet
Try shinin' my shoes and brush the fuckin' dust off of my wallet
Let's consider the prospects, make a couple phone calls
Now so many interviews you know I got next week
I'm strictly goin' from the bottom to the peak
I'm ready focused and determined to get back on my feet

I got a job at a business place I chose not to name
Ask me how did I achieve this so quick? Yes you may
Back when I was  compiled a stunning resume
I didn't value way back then, but boy it helped today
I'm pushin' every single thought of rebellin' away
I'm workin' real hard, and my pockets are swellin', and hey
Can you believe I met the girl of my dreams, I swear she's meant for me
We've been together over 2 years, goin' on 3
We married on our 4th anniversary
Bought a house and turned a room into a nursery
For the bouncin' baby that we're expecting in June
I sat in that delivery room from noon, to noon
24 hours of labour then the nurse asked me his title for the paper
You know, so the government can chase ya'
First name: John, Last name: Insignificant
I'm smiling like a proud dad; I got the birth certificate
Go to the house and here's my 
And I looked around and nothing's good enough for her or him
So my 8 hour days became 9; 9 slid up to 10; a subtle slip up to 11 and then
And after a 12 hour day, I too little energy to say 'I love you' to my baby
Or play daddy to J, and I thought this was the way 
O be a husband and a father
I guess I could've looked in her eyes, and seen I lost her
But it wasn't my fault, I'm workin' hard, it couldn't be
I've been successfully existing as a member of this family
I was so convinced the household had to always be complete
I didn't realize the only thing that's missing is me

[Chorus]

[Mr. Lif]
There was never any talk of divorce
I can't believe how focused I was in the face of such a huge potential loss
Thought I signed a grievance with the boss
In fact, I was mad at my wife, as if she's trying to knock me off course
But I still visited the florist, to get her flowers
(When the last time I did this?) Hmm, not since our wedding shower
I got home and I was greeted by the fact we'd been deleted
I was someone that my wife and child thought they no longer needed
And before I could say, 'Where's John?'
I looked down and he was clingin' to her arm
I realized-ed that I'm wrong
I blacked out and by the time I came to, they were gone
But somehow I sat and shook my head, and then I carried on
And I still completed 3 weeks of work, before my breakdown
The ambulances came and I got medicine to take now
And it's hard to get a job when you been treated and released
So both my relationship and my career had deceased
It took years to put myself together, piece by piece
And thank God I found a woman that's propitiate with me
And I'll never let this happen again, it's not to be
I'm ready focused and determined to get back on my feet

I mentioned earlier that the world is watching each of you
You make me so proud I'm the happiest woman in the world right now
I have a dream come true

I want you to listen to me now
This is being televised again worldwide today
Just calm yourselves, come on, alright, can you feel me?
Yes, this may be the most important moment in my life
There are words in this song that to me are very special, listen

It's more than you
It's more than me
No matter what we are
We are a family

This dream is for us
This one can be real
They can't stop us now
Because of how we feel

It's more than you
It's more than me
Whatever dreams we have
They're for the family

We're not alone any more then
There are others there
And this dream's big enough
For all of us to share

So don't think you're going
We're not going anywhere
We're staying, taking our share
If you get afraid again, I'll be there

We are a family like a giant tree
Branching out towards the sky

We've each got to go our separate ways
And now were standing here helpless
Looking for something to say
We've been together a long time

We never thought it would end

We were always so close to each other

You were always my friend

And its hard to say goodbye my love
Its hard to see you cry my love
Its hard to open up that door when you're not sure what you're going for

We didn't want this to happen

But we shouldn't feel sad

We had a good life together

Just remember all the times we had

You know I'll always care
And no mater how far I may go
In my heart you'll always be there

When I first saw you, I said
Oh my, that's my dream, that's my dream?
I needed a dream to make me strong

The quick toboggan when you reach the heights

The lovely loving and the hateful hates
The conversation with the flying plates
I wish I were in love again

No more pain, no more strain
Now I'm sane, but I would rather be punch drunk

The pulled-out fur of cat and cur
The fine mis-mating of a him and her
I've learned my lesson, but I wish I were
In love again

The furtive sigh, the blackened eye
The words ""I love you, till the day I day""
The self-deception that believes the lie
I wish I were in love again

When love congeals, it soon reveals
The faint aroma of performing seals
The double-crossing of a pair of heals
I wish I were in love again

No, no more care, no, no despair
Now I'm all there (now), but I'd rather be punch drunk

How can I be thankful when they start to thank the Lord, Lord
