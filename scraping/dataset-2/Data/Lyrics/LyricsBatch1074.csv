Tahiti 80,"If you've found your hair's got longer
Just go down to the hairdresser
He'll fix your hair and he makes you wonder
What you're gonna do for dinner

Take the time to take a rest
And don't be afraid to look on down
Mind your business and don't get me wrong
Because I don't give a damn'

Does anybody feel the same I do today?
I feel so strong inside",Revolution 80,2000
Tahiti 80,"It's gonna cause you sorrow
It's gonna give you all you need
Forget about tomorrow
Don't dramatize the things you did

It quickly flows to the sea
So quickly you won't see

So many things to face
And you're still in the wrong place
It's easy if you try
Don't emphasize the things inside

It quickly flows to the sea
So quickly you won't see

It's time to say goodbye
Put on your swimming suit
And then we will dive",Swimming Suit,2000
Tahiti 80,"When the sun shines bright
You are looking alright
But you get depressed
When you see your life's a mess

It moves me so when you are down
I'm upside down sad as a clown

The wind is blowing in your hair
Life is not fair
Your conscience's knocking at your door
Who is it for?
Who are your friends?
There's something wrong with them
Who are you then?
Are you the lad insane?

It moves me so when you are down
I'm upside down sad as a clown
And you know I'm not easily moved
When sadness is there it can't be removed

You can't blame it on the weather
I know that it's untrue
Things are made to last forever
With a person like you

It moves me so when you are down
I'm upside down sad as a clown

Things are made to last forever",Things Are Made to Last Forever,2000
Tahiti 80,"When the sun appears in the sky
When the moon slips away with the dark
You've been awake of a long time
Yes it's true
You're not sleeping like so many others do

Nightime isn't the shelter
It's supposed to be

Especially when you're sad
You ride the mares at night
Even if you don't want to
Even if you don't want to

Nightime, nightime...",When the Sun,2000
Tahiti 80,"Will you ever see me like a possible lover again ?
I am fed up to be your twin brother
You're not my sister
And every time I think of that 
I want to
I want to say to you
I want to talk to you
When I look into your eyes I see a yellow butterfly
When I look into your eyes I see a yellow butterfly 
Flying high in the beautiful summer sky
Every time I look into your eyes
I see a reflection of me
A distorted vision of reality
Don't waste your time
Trying to find a meaning 
To everything
You might get disappointed
I'd really like to ??? in something personal
Something I would never hear or feel in someone else's song
I often get the feeling that there's something missing
I wish I were that yellow butterfly
Sparkling in your eyes
Don't waste your time
Trying to find a meaning
To everything
You might get disappointed
I think you should know better by now
I think you should know better
In the back of my mind
There are so many things I don't want you to know
In the back of my mind
There are so many things I don't want you to know
In the back of my mind
There are so many things I don't want you to know
I don't want you to know
I think you should know better by now
I think you should know better
I should know better
You should know better
When I look into your eyes
When I look into your eyes
When I look into your eyes

Tahiti 80,"I return home with special food for my spirit
My presence will pass into eternity

We'll never be younger than today
Tomorrow's yesterday, it's never too late

You write your pretty songs
Just to discover what you wrote
You did something when you were younger...

We'll never be younger than today
Tomorrow's yesterday, it's never too late

Everything is over now
Everything is over now

We'll never be younger than today
(And today's left us so fast)
Tomorrow's yesterday, it's never too late

Both the laughter and the rain

She is living somewhere for a while
Still I ask her in my lonely way to stay

Desiree Desiree 
Now she's 
Leaving

Desiree you know
How it hurts me
Living alone through all the years
Nothing can hold the tears in me

Everything remains the same
Yet she answers not her name
Still If I could
Look beyond these skies
Standing here again before my eyes I'd see

Desiree Desiree 
Now she's 
Leaving

Desiree you know
How it hurts me
Where do I run to 
Is it real
Nothing but pain I feel for real

How it hurts me

Living alone through all the years
Nothing can hold the tears in me

She loves me she loves me she loves me

A love from outer space

It's true oh

I know where she's coming from
Space is where we both belong
Got to tell her in this song
This time nothing can go wrong (X2)

Take a ticket to ride the space express
Meet the girl in the starstruck dress
She trusts me more than I can never guess
I just couldn't wait for her caress
She comes from the milky way
She came to earth for my birthday
We worked out hard to communicate
She said I am not a fake

Shalalalalalala hoo (X4)

She loves me she loves me she loves me
A love from outer space

Tahiti 80,"As I look back on some nights in the park,
Strange meetings in the dark,
I can see you talking to unknown shadow
As the black sky is coming down on us so low

[Chorus]
And I wonder why
I always keep pleasant memories of the past
Why anything bad or good seems better,
Once it has passed

I'm facing the ceiling, alone in the dark
Remembering all the things
Which have left a mark
I find it hard to see what stands in the shadow
As if somebody didn't want me to know

May only make sense to me

You may burn your wings and crash to the ground
It makes you wish you were lost and never found
But you feel your face is blushing now

Looking back, it's always the same vicious circle
You fall in love like you'd fall from a bicycle
And everybody's walking in slow motion
You don't, you can't control your reaction

You should try, because
You may burn your wings and crash to the ground
It makes you wish you were lost and never found
But you feel your face is blushing now

Your eyes are like an open book
One can tell everything from the way you look
The way you look

You may burn your wings and crash to the ground

She's leaving her people
And all her troubles behind

I put them in a vase so I'd get a chance to know
What it was like to live
With someone who could do this
What it was like to live
With someone now she doesn't miss

To pretend everything was fine

That it was all just falling apart

Let's run away from the path
We used to take each day
And then we'll face the aftermath
Of our yesterdays

Is it me or are we really
Going out of our minds?
I'd never thought I would be
Somebody not so kind
I don't want to bring you down
But there's no one else around
It's like walking in a ghost town
Or living six feet under ground

Let's run away from the path
We used to take each day
And then we'll face the aftermath
Of our yesterdays

Taiguara,"Hoje
Trago em meu corpo as marcas do meu tempo
Meu desespero, a vida num momento
A fossa, a fome, a flor, o fim do mundo

Hoje
Trago no olhar imagens distorcidas
Cores, viagens, mãos desconhecidas
Trazem a lua, a rua às minhas mãos

Mas hoje,
As minhas mãos enfraquecidas e vazias
Procuram nuas pelas luas, pelas ruas
Na solidão das noites frias por você

Hoje
Homens sem medo aportam no futuro
Eu tenho medo, acordo e te procuro
Meu quarto escuro é inerte como a morte

Hoje
Homens de aço esperam da ciência
Eu desespero e abraço a tua ausência
Que é o que me resta, vivo em minha sorte

Ah, sorte
Eu não queria a juventude assim perdida
Eu não queria andar morrendo pela vida
Eu não queria amar assim como eu te amei

Duna branca, lua imensa, Maria deita
Nua e branda como as nuvens que a lua enleita
Duas tranças, uma flor e Maria enfeita
Suas mansas curvas cheias que a areia aceita

Era noite de verão
Vi o amor nasceu num sorriso seu
O luar me convidou
Mar nos temperou e ela me envolveu

Nessa rede ela prendeu
Minha dor se viu, minha solidão
Nessa rede eu vi nascer minha liberdade

Tua rede, minha sede
E o amor te trouxe
Quero ver o mar salgando teu seio doce
E em cadeias de amor puro
Viver guardado
Joga areias do futuro no meu passado

Uh, uh",Maria Do Futuro,1994
Taiguara,"Olhando o dia de chuva
Vi que mais triste era eu
Sem estrela e sem lua
Te procurava no céu
Fiz do piano a viola
Fiz de mim mesmo um amigo
Fiz da verdade uma estória
Fiz do meu som meu abrigo

Quem canta fala consigo
Quem faz amor nunca quer ferir
Quem não fere vive tranquilo
Vê muita gente sorrir

E quem não estiver do seu lado
A quem não acabou feliz
Não diga que não se importa
Diga só o que o amor lhe diz
Essa mentira é uma espuma
Que se desmancha no are
E deixa marcas no espelho
Pra você se ver chorar

Vivo a minha vida seja onde for
Hoje entrei na dança e não vou sair
Vem que eu sou criança e não sei fingir

Eu preciso, eu, preciso de você
Há! Eu preciso, eu preciso, eu
Preciso muito de você

Lá onde eu estive o sonho acabou
Cá onde te encontro, só começou
Lá colhi uma estrela pra te trazer
Pegue o brilho dela até entender

Eu preciso, eu, preciso de você
Há! Eu preciso, eu preciso, eu
Preciso muito de você

Só fecha o seu livro quem já aprendeu
Só peça outro amor, quem já deu o seu
Quem não soube a sombra, não sabe a luz
Vem, não perde o amor de quem te conduz

Ao lugar onde essa angustia se desfaz
E o veneno e a solidão mudam de cor

Vai indo amor
Vai recupera a paz perdida e as ilusões,
não espera vir a vida às tuas mãos
Faz em fera a flor ferida e vai lutar
Pro amor voltar

Vai faz de um corpo de mulher estrada e sol
Te faz aman, te Faz meu peito errante
Acreditar que amanheceu

Nesse momen, to vai ser teu momento
O mundo inteiro vai ser teu, teu, teu",Viagem,1994
Taiguara,"Eu desisto
Não existe essa manhã que eu perseguia
Um lugar que me dê trégua ou me sorria
E uma gente que não viva só pra si

Só encontro
Gente amarga mergulhada no passado
Procurando repartir seu mundo errado
Nessa vida sem amor que eu aprendi

Por uns velhos vãos motivos
Somos cegos e cativos
No deserto do universo sem amor

E é por isso que eu preciso
De você como eu preciso
Não me deixe um só minuto sem amor
Vem comigo
Meu pedaço de universo é no teu corpo
Eu te abraço corpo imerso no teu corpo

Que estou morto pra esse triste mundo antigo
Que meu porto, meu destino, meu abrigo

São teu corpo amante amigo em minhas mãos
São teu corpo amante amigo em minhas mãos

Old folks praying everybody swaying
Loudly, I chanted my praise
How I sang about the Judgment morn
And of Gabriel tooting on his horn
In that sunny land of milk and honey
I had no complaints
While I thought of Saints
So I say to all who feel forlorn:

Sing ""Hallelujah! Hallelujah!"" and you'll shoo the blues away
When cares pursue you, ""Hallelujah!""
Gets you through the darkest day
Satan lies awaiting and creating skies of grey
But ""Hallelujah! Hallelujah!""
Helps to shoo the clouds away",Hallelujah,2013

I never felt like this before
Something's got a hold on me that won't let go
I believe I'd die if I only could
I sure feel strange, but I sure feel good
I said, oh yeah
It must be love
(You know it must be love)

Something's got a hold on me
(Oh, it must be love)
Something's got a hold on me right now child
(Yeah, it must be love)

Let me tell you now
I got a feeling, I feel so strange
Everything about me seems to have changed
Step by step, I got a brand new walk
I even sound sweeter when I talk
I said, oh yeah
It must be love
(You know it must be love)

Let me tell you now
My heart feels heavy, my feet feel light
I shake all over, but I feel alright
I never felt like this before
Something's got a hold on me that won't let go
I never thought it could happen to me
My heart was heavy when in misery
I never thought it could be this way
Love's sure gonna put a hurting on me

I said oh yeah
It must be love
(You know it must be love)
Yeah he walks kike love

Taime Downe,"Seek him here, seek him on the highway
Never knowing when he'll appear
All await, engine's ticking over
Hear the roar as they sense the fear

Wheels! A glint of steel and a flash of light!
Screams! From a streak of fire as he strikes!

Hell bent, hell bent for leather
Hell bent, hell bent for leather

Black as night, faster than a shadow
Crimson flare from a raging sun
An exhibition, of sheer precision
Yet no one knows from where he comes

Fools! Self destruct cannot take that crown
Dreams! Crash one by one to the ground

Hell bent, hell bent for leather
Hell bent, hell bent for leather

There's many who tried to prove that they're faster
But they didn't last and they died as they tried

There's many who tried to prove that they're faster
But they didn't last and they died as they tried

Hell bent, hell bent for leather
Hell bent, hell bent for leather
Hell bent, hell bent for leather
Hell bent, hell bent for leather",Hell Bent for Leather [Spahn Ranch Mix],2001

Taina,"The only aphrodisiac I need is your voice
Hearing you speak my name
Beckoning me to answer
Telling me you want me
So I tell you that you're the answer to 
Every question I've ever had about love

Without words I use my tongue to tell the tale of us
Tracing your shadowscape
Kneeling before you my eyes feast upon your masculinity and
All its divinity and I praise you
Because all of that is for me

I begin to indulge myself of your delicacies
Digesting semi-sweet dark chocolate decadence as it melts
Dripping down my chin
Your taste is something Godiva couldn't re-create

Needing every atom of your anatomy
Necessity is placed upon me 
Knowing you are the source of my serendipity
Dipping in and out of me stroking more than my consciesness
Subconsciously I find myself rewinding our love scenes
In my daydreams
Seeing that face you make when you're making me cum
And it makes me want you right there and then

Thinking of you in inappropriate places I get
Tingling sensations in private locations 
Where I wish to be caught between a rock and your hard place

As wetness develops my legs begin to open
And my spot turns to a backdraft and all I want you to do is extinguish it
You know my body like the back of your hands
And touch me and send me into ecstacy

My thighs quiver in anticipation 
Of deep penetration which gets me high
Body rising
Sweating
Panting
Make-up melting
Pulling my hair and
Scratching my back
I get a temporary case of tourettes 
Because all I can say are four letter words 
In a four octave-range screaming your name

Aye papi

You fucking me makes me bilingual
You fucking me makes me bilingual
You fucking me makes me bilingual
You fucking me makes me bilingual
You fucking me makes me bilingual

I see your tongue pink between your lips and I want it between mine
And I struggle
As you lick torturing me
I try to get away but
Not really

Running out of room begging for more up against the wall 
That has been scuffed by my stilletos
Again
You pry apart my thighs and tell me to be still
And I willingly submit to you 
Because I love the way you dominate me
Demanding that I cum for you so I do as I'm told

You've molded me so I'm good to no-one else but you
You've conquered this once orgasmicless world and multiplied it
Again and
Again

My face radiates with after-glow
My pillow scented by you
A fragrance which haunts me
My room smells of the best sex

Covered in body prints and finger prints and you above me
Your name written indelibly upon my body in your genetic history

You fucking me makes me bilingual
You fucking me makes me bilingual

On the roller coaster of love, when I see you shine like pearl

I know you got a man and all, but he ain't treatin' you right
Nine times out of ten, you won't see him tonight
Baby girl, I'm tellin' you, wan' smellin' you, wanna situation

That I would say

Grow with,

Created you for me to love, 
And the way I feel it can't be denied, no

My eyes, 
I'm the one that you wanna grow
Old with
The only one who's really by your side
And I'm the one that you know you can
Grow with,

The shadows.

All you gotta do is fall from grace,

Do, They don't understand it's just us
Two,
Why they always tryina intervene, They
Don't understand that it's our dream,
Well, to the left, to the left,we should
Tell them to get to the left,
Why they always tryina intervene, They
Don't understand that it's our dream...

Tiny tots with their eyes all aglow

And every mother's child is gonna spy
To see if reindeer really know how to fly.

The holder of the key
I gave You my heart

Have I taken You for granted

Won't You help me understand it

God can You hear me
I need You here tonight
I'm tired of pretending that everything's alright
And I know, I know that You hold tomorrow
But I need You here tonight

I want to feel
I need something real
I want to go closer to You

No one but myself to blame
I got lost in the rain
Then I got stuck in a spider web
Tangled up in all my cares
Such a lonely affair

Like a raging sea
Fear wants to swallow me
I've searched but there's no peace without You

But if I lose this life
I know I'll find it in You
So won't You take my life
'Cause I surrender to You
I'm running back to the Truth

Lost, so lost
Somewhere in the dead of night
Drifting like a satellite
Spinnin' out of control
But love, Your love
Is stronger than gravity
And it's pullin' at the heart of me
And I'm giving in

Like a raging sea
Fear wants to swallow me
I've searched but there's no peace without You

But if I lose this life
I know I'll find it in You
So won't You take my life
'Cause I surrender to You
I'm running back to the Truth

Tait,"Slipping away
Are we sleeping at the wheel and unaware now
Has the population put us in a trance now
Overtaken by the tide and washed away now
What do you say now

In a daze
Are we moving in the motion of the crowd now
Slowly losing everything we were about now
Is it time to draw a line in the sand now
And take a stand now

Somebody talk to me, am I all alone?
When are we gonna wake up?
Are we numb, is the feeling gone?
Tell me what went wrong are we numb?
Close your eyes let the world pass by
Now you're hypnotized are we numb?

Moving away
From the heart of everything we tried to be now
Just stop look and tell me what you see now
We've been taken like the winds across the sea now
We've gotta break free now

Mesmerized
Desensitized
Before my eyes
I'm paralyzed

Somebody talk to me, am I all alone?
When are we gonna wake up?
Are we numb is the feeling gone?
Tell me what went wrong are we numb?
Close your eyes let the world pass by
Now you're hypnotized are we numb?

We're drifting
We're dreaming
We're floating away

So many times we just watch pass by
The tick tock of life leaving us hypnotized
Mesmerized a stun gun leaving you in a daze
Better wake up now before you find yourself slipping away

Are we numb, is the feeling gone?
Tell me what went wrong are we numb?
Close your eyes let the world pass by
Now you're hypnotized are we numb?

But I'm reconnecting
I've had enough of my way
And I'm tired of rejecting
I realized it was all a lie
So I climbed down from the edge
I've been outta touch
But I'm reconnecting
To You

I can feel You under my skin
Wanna have You light me up again
Tell me where I should begin
Keep me turning

Power comes from Your extension
The words You speak are my intervention
Give me sight to know Your intention

How can a poor boy? You don't believe anything that's true

Not speaking to the profane

How can a poor boy get this message to you?
How can a poor boy when you don't believe a thing that's true?

Even been magnified
Spied a chapel all of gold
The priest was laying down with the swine

How can a poor boy get a little message to you?
How can a poor boy when you don't believe anything is true?
How can a poor boy get this message through to you?
How can a poor boy when you don't believe a single thing is true?

Tell me what evil lurks in the hearts of men

Too much to take, too much weight?

My undertaking took me I was making in my stealth
A wealth of rhymes of crazy I would chuckle to myself
Then they went into the mental rolodex
See I knew 'em by heart like a brain in my chest
Then I took 'em to school where subjects were getting felt

Stumbling all around, stumbling all around
Stumbling all around so funny
Stumbling here and there, stumbling everywhere 
And I must declare, I stepped right on her toes
And when she bumped my nose
I fell and when I rose
I felt ashamed and told her 
That's the latest step, that's the latest step
That's the latest step, my honey
Notice all the pep, notice all the pep, notice all the pep
She said, ""Stop mumbling, tho you are stumbling
I like it just a little bit, just a little bit, quite a little bit""
 
Young and small short and tall
Folks most everywhere
Take a chance do this dance
They think it's a bear
People rave and they crave 
Just to do this step
Off they go, nice and slow
When the band starts playing
 
Stumbling all around, stumbling all around
Stumbling all around so funny
Stumbling here and there, stumbling everywhere 
And I must declare, I stepped right on her toes
And when she bumped my nose
I fell and when I rose
I felt ashamed and told her 
That's the latest step, that's the latest step
That's the latest step, my honey
Notice all the pep, notice all the pep, notice all the pep
She said, ""Stop mumbling, tho you are stumbling
I like it just a little bit, just a little bit, quite a little bit""

Tak Takvorian,"When an early autumn walks the land and chills the breeze
And touches with her hand the summer trees,
Perhaps you'll understand what memories I own.
There's a dance pavilion in the rain all shuttered down,

A winding country lane all russet brown,
A frosty window pane shows me a town grown lonely.
That spring of ours that started so April-hearted,
Seemed made for just a boy and girl.

I never dreamed, did you, any fall would come in view
So early, early.
Darling if you care, please, let me know,
I'll meet you anywhere, I miss you so.
Let's never have to share another early autumn.",Early Autumn,1999
Tak Takvorian,"A country dance was being held in a garden
I felt a bump and heard an ""Oh, beg your pardon""
Suddenly I saw polka dots and moonbeams
All around a pug-nosed dream

The music started and was I the perplexed one
I held my breath and said ""May I have the next one?""
In my frightened arms, polka dots and moonbeams
Sparkled on a pug-nosed dream

There were questions in the eyes of other dancers
As we floated over the floor
There were questions but my heart knew all the answers
And perhaps a few things more

Now in a cottage built of lilacs and laughter
I know the meaning of the words ""Ever after""
And I'll always see polka dots and moonbeams
When I kiss the pug-nosed dream",Polka Dots and Moonbeams,1999
Tak Takvorian,"Every day seems like a year
Sweetheart, when you are not near
All that you claim must be true
For I'm just the same as you

[Chorus]
Sometimes I'm happy, sometimes I'm blue
My disposition depends on you
I never mind the rain from the skies
If I can find the sun in your eyes
Sometimes I love you, sometimes I hate you
But when I hate you, it's 'cause I love you
That's how I am, so what can I do?
I'm happy when I'm with you

Stars are smiling at me from your eyes
Sunbeams now there will be in the skies
Tell me that you will be true
That will all depend on you

What about people other than me? 
What about those with nothing to eat? 
How can I claim that life isn't fair? 
What a pathetic sight I swear
If I could kick I'd kick
Myself of course and if

No te amargues ten la seguridad
de que tambien ella se arrepentira'

Well in that case
Why won't she answer the phone? 
Don't try and tell me
She's not at home
I'm sorry but what can say

Lo siento pero no se que decir
We're sorry but what can I say
I love her so much I can't think
What are we doing? What have we done?
What in the world is going on?
Isn't it crazy looking so fine
Knowing that in as much time
As it takes to make a drink
We could all become as the dinosaur has
Nothing but extinct
And to top it all I hear
That my rent is to be raised

So if you see Mary
Will you tell her I called
Tell her that I love her
And I'm sorry that's all
And by the way thank you for being so kind
If I've taken up too much of your time
I'm sorry but what I can say

Finding no comfort I'd toss and turn all night
Until one day I saw behind a golden door
A tiny ray of light

Opened my heart to find
Another chance a better time

To break those chains that bind
I found the strength somewhere I never knew was there
Left my fears behind

And I can see it clear
A special place not far from here
Follow my destiny
Where I believe You'll be waiting for me

Riding on his roller coaster
Just waiting a safe heaven
Someone to love and can lean on, just lean on

My spirit will dance free so joyful I will be

Floating on the desert wind

Never knowing the cost of what we paid
Letting someone else be strong

We're crossing over
Just to see the firelight
And the innocent are getting over
Being old tonight

Takida,"Hold on tight, be the strong one to melt the fight, make it all right
Hatred grows, leaving leads for us, yes it shows, can't find harmony
You won't heal, it's for real

Surely fall, never take friendship personal,
Go your own way and prove them wrong
It's in your hands now, hanging on to the hopeful words,
Plant a seed with a need

I am never alone, I'm failing to turn
I will never miss home, I want to get back again
I am never alone, my colors will burn,
Never alone, always alone

Fearful eyes watching all around,
All this time with no heart and you never cry
Where's the power in that? It's not right, sending signals of shame
I once knew, so did you

I am never alone, I'm failing to turn
I will never miss home, I want to get back again
I am never alone, my colors will burn,
Never alone, always alone

Taking Back Sunday,"Hey, Merry Christmas, Adam! Merry Christmas, Fred!
Merry Christmas to everyone
Yeah man
You having a good year?
Yeah, it just feels good to be next to you here on the holidays
Hearing you say merry Christmas
It just warms my heart, man
It's like soul food, like fired okra
Dude, I'm having a great holiday this year, it's awesome
Yeah man, so you wanna sing for these people or what?
Yeah, here we go, okay

On the first day of Christmas
My true love gave to me
A partridge in a pear tree
I don't even know what a partridge is, to be honest
A partridge is a bird
I think it's a bird that doesn't fly
Like Danny Bonaduce?
Um, no, it's
He's ripped, ripped I'm telling you
I heard he's a little, you know, fallen on the deep end, maybe
Oh, yeah, well
He's gonna kick my ass now
No, it's against that napoleon complex, he's short

So, on the, on the second day of Christmas
My true love gave to me two turtle doves
And a partridge in a pear tree
Turtle doves?
They're nice, do they have shells?
Uh, I don't know

But, on the third day of Christmas
My true love gave to me
Three French hens
Two turtle doves
And a partridge in a pear tree
From now on can you sing
""And a Danny Bonaduce""?

On the fourth day of Christmas
My true love gave to me
Four calling birds
Three French hens
Two turtle doves
And a Danny Bonaduce
That's good! Yeah, yeah, it works, the syllables

Yeah, so I started to wonder
If my true love, my old lady
Was going to get me anything
Other than a bunch of birds
Yeah, they're all, like, pooping everywhere and stuff, it's gross
They're hard to clean up after
So far she got me four calling birds,
French hens, turtle doves
The French hens, which are the French hens
They're eating all your cheese
Drinking up all your wine
Like all hours of the day
I love France
So, I was wondering when
She was going to get me something good

And on the fifth day of Christmas
My true love gave to me
Five golden rings
Nice!
Yeah, I was finally happy
Four calling birds
Three French hens
Two turtle doves
And a par-Danny Bonaduce

So, like, with the five golden rings
That's kinda nice
Yeah, but on the sixth day, she started getting-
Like Lil Wayne
Or what's another rapper
That has like a bunch of silly jewelry?
Um, I don't know any, man

But, on the sixth day
It kinda went downhill
And the seventh cause she got me
Six geese a-laying
Geese a-laying?
Like laying down?
No, like, geese that are laying
Like, oh, like
That's gross, yeah, I don't know about that
And then on the seventh day-
I often wonder how geese would go about doing that
If you're picking up what I'm putting down
I-I don't want to talk about it, man, okay

On the seventh day?
Seventh day
Seven swans swimming
More birds!
Swimming?
I hate it

On the eight day it got really weird
Cause on the eight day of Christmas
My true love gave to me
Eight maids a-milking
What?! Yeah!
What, are they milking the geese cause they're laying?
I think they're like lactating or something
I don't get that, yeah
I'm not into it

But, on the ninth day of Christmas
My true love gave to me
Nine ladies dancing
Nice! Okay, cool
Oh, well that explains the maids a-milking
No, these were like exotic dancers
Like you can see on the internet
Yeah, it was nice
There was like one of those poles and all that stuff
Yeah, but this is your old lady
That's getting you all these things, that's kinda weird
I know, but she's looking out for me, you know
Tenth day, tenth day, okay

On the tenth day it got crazy again
Cause she gave me ten lords a -leaping
Like the dark lords?
I don't know
That's so weird, and then the eleventh day
Pipers piping
Pipers piping?
These are, by far, the strangest gifts I have ever received
I don't understand-
Wait, like, laying pipe?
No, that's the geese that are laying pipe
Oh, well maybe they're laying it with the pipers
Which would be weird all together

But, on the twelfth day of Christmas
This is the last day
My true love gave to me
Twelve drummers drumming
Everybody could use a good drummer
Yeah, I could use twelve drummers, yeah
The Grateful Dead had two drummers
Dude, Slipknot has like ten, yeah
Did you get to, like, choose which drummers
Or are they just studio guys?
I think they were pretty bad ass
Oh, cool
I mean, not that Mark's not
I mean, Mark's kicking some ass, yeah
You know
Was he one of the twelve?
Um, I don't know, but

So, let's go down the list
And finish this godforsaken song off
Oh, okay and wish everyone a very merry Christmas

Twelve drummers drumming
Eleven pipers piping
Ten lords a-leaping
Nine ladies dancing
Let's give it up for the ladies dancing
Go ladies! Okay
Eight maids a-milking
Seven swans a-swimming
Six geese a-laying
Five golden rings
Four calling birds
Three French hens
Two turtle doves
And a Danny Bonaduce

The night is ‘75 there was this chick named Janet 
A pregnant heroin addict who said she didn't plan it
So never thought to stop, or ever kick the habit
'Cause Kirby let her do it and she knew he always had it
Down in his cellar with Trevor another addict
Who was at it like an asthmatic trapped in an attic
Sucking on an asthma punt 
Though you never know by looking at him that's the cunt
Who by 1983 was in the national front
Yeah he had a shaved head but still got mashed on drugs
So Kirby didn't mind him hanging round that much
Especially anytime Janet came round to fuck
Get her fix while her kid Chris waited around
A nine year old boy he was healthy and loud
'Cause even when she was pregnant she was smoking around
And she was ducking that he wasn't born disabled somehow

Still when you're too loud you get a clap round your head
Kirby ain't his dad but he does what he says
Stays downstairs in the cellar with Trev
While Kirby's upstairs giving Janet her meds
At least that's what they tell Chris still he ain't that dumb

6 years past now Kirby's hookin' up the crack
It's the new drug everybody's going crazy for
1989 the year Chris started selling draw
Picking up from Kirby, scar there beneath his eye
Think after everything that's happened he would treat him right
But par him off with just another ounce of weed
'Cause a quarter of the bag is a bunch of fuckin' seeds
Hundreds of them and twigs the size of fuckin' trees 
But if he ever moaned he get a slap across his cheek

1990 is the year that really took it's toll 
'Cause that's the year his mother Janet took an overdose 
Of heroin and died, god rest her tortured soul
Now he's left to fend for himself or by his own

Mr drug dealer

it's 1995, now that he's older stress weighs on his shoulders
Heavy as boulders, but he hides it from his olders
He's been living on the far side since he was a youth
But the way he lives now is a far cry
From the way he, did in the past 'cause he's
Made his way up from sellin' ounces to bars of weed
Out In the streets, where people do their nasty deeds 
He sees ‘em making money so he wants a larger piece
He's a man now, 21 years of age
It's been a couple years since Kirby's palms were raised
Lost in anger, ended up across his face 'cause he's a man now
And Kirby knows he's past his stage of gettin' beats
Still that don't change the way he treats
Chris when he comes round to his, to get his weed
Kirby don't like his attitude he's cocky now believe
So again he palms him off with more twigs and fuckin' seeds

But Chris ain't havin' none of it he ain't no little kid now
He squares up to Kirby who really don't look that big now
And really can't do shit now but pay Chris what he owes
And weed but also pride 'cause that what Chris takes when he goes
Kirby knows he's getting old, and that's what really hurts
He ain't cut out for this work the way he once was upon a time
But he don't know no other way to make a living on the grind	
Selling drugs is all he's been, his only way of getting by

Music is freedom (Waya Waya)
Sean Paul 'longside Tal

Dans tous les pays du monde
Même quand la colère gronde
Il y a toujours des gens qui s'élèvent
Dans les tribus, les capitales
Que le tempo soit pop ou tribal
Il n'y a jamais de différence
On dit ce que l'on pense

Take your time, close your eyes
Better keep the song as your friend
We livin' it up we not slippiin' it up
We livin' it up we not givin' it up
Près d'ici, loin de là
Il y a des gens qui portent nos joies
We livin' it up we not slippiin' it up
We livin' it up we not givin' it up

Tell them say music is life
Remember life is music
Mad people vibes
And we chant we us it
To build connection
And we never will lose it
Even in yard
'Nuff love we're bootsin'
Inna this life
Trouble ever be looming
If you face it alone it
It can seem so dooming
Jammin' and we come
Together we grooving
Keep positivity flowers them blooming!

Take your time, close your eyes
Better keep the song as your friend
We livin' it up we not slippiin' it up
We livin' it up we not givin' it up
Près d'ici, loin de là
Il y a des gens qui portent nos joies
We livin' it up we not slippiin' it up
We livin' it up we not givin' it up

Là-bas, là-bas
De l'Afrique aux Amériques
Tout près de là
Il y a toujours de la musique

Every corner we a take it to the world
Take it and spread it to the world

Là-bas, là-bas
Il n'y a pas de silence
On a le droit
De chanter nos différences

Every corner we a take it to the world
Take it and spread it to the world

Take your time, close your eyes
Better keep the song as your friend
We livin' it up we not slippiin' it up

Tous les long courriers les images
Les attentions et les témoignages
Me rappellent tristement que toi tu dors
Le temps n'a pas chassé le mal
Tes yeux ne sont plus là 
Mais ton regard vit au fond de moi
Comme un espoir
Ces quelques mots pour toi
Toutes mes pensées
Je les chante à présent sans oublier
Je cherche à savoir pourquoi
Ton destin s'est déchiré
Les jours de bonheur effacés
Ta lumière dans le ciel fait briller
Toutes les larmes que ceux qui t'aiment
Auront versés
Tout c'qui part quand une âme s'en va
Et qui brise ceux qui restent là
Éternelle absence qui nous blesse
Mais tu restes à travers cet amour
Que l'on te porte chaque jour
Un ange à nos côtés
Oh
Tu es dans mes pensées
Le temps n'a pas chassé le mal
Tes yeux ne sont plus là
Mais ton regard
Vit au fond de moi 
Comme un espoir

Ces quelques mots pour toi
Toutes mes pensées
Je les chante à présent sans oublier
Je cherche à savoir pourquoi
Ton destin s'est déchiré
Les jours de bonheur effacés
Ta lumière dans le ciel fait briller
Toutes les larmes que ceux qui t'aiment
Auront versés
Je vois ton visage dans le ciel
Je vois ton visage dans le soleil
Et ton sourire
Ton image me donne des ailes
L'éternité s'étend et tu reves
Ces quelques mots pour toi
Toutes mes pensées
Je les chante à présent sans oublier
Je cherche à savoir pourquoi
Ton destin s'est déchiré
Les jours de bonheur effacés
Ta lumière dans le ciel fait briller
Toutes les larmes que ceux qui t'aiment
Auront versés
Ces quelques mots pour toi

What if tomorrow could come back again (back again)

Clock is ticking, move fast 
Watching passing by the time that lasts 
Make you wanna take back every second 
So you wanna bring back every second 
To re-live this moment with family, best friends 
Call one, last one, ask him to come back home 
And I ain't tryna be smart or give a lecture
Just take a picture of the past and the future 
So I could decide what it's use 
Never have them play no, no I refuse 
Make me do what I had to do 
It makes me stronger now, I think I gotta move

Still got me wondering, wondering 
What could change or what would still remain, still remain
