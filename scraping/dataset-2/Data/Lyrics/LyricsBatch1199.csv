Nigga, set the floor and take it up
Baby, put it down and give it up

Nigga, set the floor and take it up

So listen a couple girls
Who was in and now I mess with cover girls
Of magazines, you can catch me on a cover, girl
I created my own planet to hover the earth and cover the world
I spit so sick, I'm calling the world
I see you tryna claim her now I play with her pearls
They try to come at me but all of 'em sterile
Life's a bitch, but I made her my girl
Now she does what I say, does what I please
No she's not religious but she lives on her knees
Jack and Jill went up the hill
Each with a buck and a quarter
Jill came back with $2.50
What a working girl!
Now work it, girl! Like

Uh uh uh, ah ah
Like uh uh uh, ah ah

Hey girl, I like to do it, but when I do it, oh oh my God
Hey girl, I like to do it, but when I do it, oh oh my God
Oh oh my God, oh oh my God, oh oh my God, I like to do it
I love when you make a pass at me, a pass at me
I love when you make a pass at me, a pass at me

I love when I see your pretty ass on the floor
I like when I see you break it down like you in control

I've got a cup to my right and a cup to my left
I'm stumbling and I'm out of breath
'Cause I'm g-g-g-g-ggg-gone
'Cause I'm g-g-g-g-ggg-gone
I got a girl to my right and a girl to my left
The one in the middle and I'm feeling on her breasts
'Cause I'm g-g-g-g-ggg-gone
'Cause I'm g-g-g-g-ggg-gone

Hey girl, I like to do it, but when I do it, oh oh my God
Hey girl, I like to do it, but when I do it, oh oh my God

No matter what you tell me, I will never give up
There's no excuse for failing, so don't hold your breath for love
I will never let you come and steal my joy
Just give up stop trying, I'm no concern of yours
If I'm just a pilot, won't you come fly with me
You're wasting so much time with this negativity

You'd do anything for the one you love
Cause anytime that you needed me I'd be there

The only problem is that you was using me
In a different way than I was using you

Today she leaves her nest

And she picked one out west
She's had enough grey
The clouds need to part

Raised her all alone

Her daddy liked to swear

She's going somewhere she can feel the earth close to stars

And walked all on the side of her mind

[Intro: Missy Elliott]
We are the VA players
Love to the Neptunes and the Clipse
To ya bootleggers we breaking off both of ya legs
The underrated Maganoo, comin' with the unexpected
The run away slave I, Mistameanor
Escaping from all ya fraudulent players
Last but not least, the heavyweight champion, Mr. Mosley
[Verse 1: Timbaland]
It's been a long time, I shouldn't have left you
Without some little nieces and nephews
To cover all the beats, and the rhymes I been through
Time's up, sorry I left you
Thinking of this, I keep repeating them hits
Like that Aaliyah, Timberlake, or Missy Elliott shit (Shit)
As you sit by the radio, hands on the dial tone
As you hear it, pump up the volume
Jump when you hear them speakers left it off (Off)
Mr. VA 'bout to set it off
Well I don't know what you heard, and I don't know what ya know
Well my folks don' told me, (YOU GOT IT! Oh)
So, ""Up Jumps the Boogie"", let the record work (Uh huh)
And put me on like you red alert
'Cause it's the big bad Timmy, Maganoo, and Missy
Like THREE THE HARD WAY!, comin' straight out of Virginia
[Chorus: Missy Elliott]
DJ's in the mix shows you better go to the record store and
COP THAT SHIT! (Oh Lord)
And to the bootleggers giving em bootlegs
We breaking off both of ya legs, COP THAT SHIT! (Oh Lord)
Stop burnin' CD's for ya friend and I'ma say it again, nucca
COP THAT SHIT! (Oh Lord)
'Cause this the hot shit, out on the streets
So when you hear this CD go and COP THAT SHIT! (Oh Lord)

[Verse 2: Missy Elliott]
When you say you love me, it doesn't matter
It goes into my head as just chit-chatter
You may think I'm egotistical or just very free
Won'tcha say I go tell it to, TIMOTHY!
People say I'm whack, but they don't tell me so
Let them pretend to be me, then they know
I hate when one, pretend to fantasize
Fact I despise, those who even try
Sweat between my thighs {*sniff*} never stinking
Yo dream is over, career sinking
I told all of you, like I told all of them
Whatcha say to me be, DICK TO YA CHIN!
In one ear and right out the other
""Ayyio Missy you ugly!"" yeah ya mother
I don't pay attention, I don't concentrate
You ain't got the bait, that it takes to hook this, huh

[Chorus]

[Verse 3: Magoo]
I'm your idol, the highest title, numero uno
I'm not a Puerto Rican but I do look up to Vagil
And understand I got the gift of speech
And it's a blessing, being from them VA streets
I talk sense condensed in the form of a poem
If I wasn't writing rhymes I'd be breaking in homes
I'm kinda young, so my gun's my security
I'm not afraid nucca do what you gon do to me
I get paid when your record is played
To put it short, heh I got it made
I'm talented, yes I'm gifted
My uppercut boy that'll get ya lifted
You got cash? man stop frontin
Living off damn every record that you cutting
My name Magoo and I roll wit two stars
Every CD we split 48 bars
My name Magoo and I'm a supadupa star
Every other month I get a brand new car!

Timbaland:
It's about 5:15 got a call from Weezie West
Timbaland you have a check on my desk
You must pick it up by 7
Or you'll have to pick it up by 11
Wait a minute I got a meeting at 6
I can't pick it up by 7-ish
Therefore I must pick wait until tomorrow
Go to my man and ask if I can borrow
200 or 100 chips
If I get them then I dip
Now it's about 9:15
Got a page from my girl Misdemean
Timbaland I need you to meet me out in Queens
While you on your way don't forgetto bring

Don't forget da gat and the cigarettes
It's about 10:15
Call on my cell it's this fine beauty queen
Timbaland make my body hot, make it steam
Shit, it's 11:15
Got another call from another beauty queen
But I can't hit, got to see Misdemean
Here I am out in the middle of Queens

Hopin I can hit one of my queens
So I hit about 7:15
Then I finish at 9:15
Tell her to wake me up at 10:15
But she wakes me up at 11:15

Girl it ain't a blunt, so don't smoke it
Better if you grab it with your hand then you choke it

Drinking like a cellar, pass out drunk
7:15 had a dream I was a monk

Buck a crystal, hit a nigga with my blunt philly
Fake MC's getting assed like they eatin' chili
Only way they seem to rap is if they got a philly
Maybe I'm Nicole Brown, 'cause you really kill me
Got away with hittin' me, but you ain't O.J.
I'm 'bout to shake up the world like Cassius Clay
When I bumble watch your back 'cause I sting like a bee
This ain't the wild, wild West and you ain't cool Moe Dee
Watch a movie now you think that you really Joe Pesci
You don't want beef with me, like a diaper I'm messy

I'm that laid back brother they call Timbaland
I drive a 850 sometimes a 3-2 Mazda van
You can catch me standin' in my B-boy stance
Or catch me at home watchin' ""Who's the Man?""
They call robber, 'cause I pack much heat
Don't call me now, because they dig the way I speaks
I'm like a genie, because I've been trapped in a bottle
I've got more stunts, than that nigga Desperado
Come follow, a mad brother where'll there be no sun

You get death like row, I take a beanie then I jet
Peace to Tupac, 'cause he was dope as it get
Twisted but you ain't Keith Sweat and shit got hot

Get on me, bone me, act like you own me
Then I gotta feel your crazy ass out homie, what?

Tim, come over here and take my address
I undress in a black neglige like Faye Dunaway
Run your fingers through my hair and squeeze my nipples
Love the way you're talkin' in my ear like that baby tickles
Later for uptown, no time to go downtown
I'm wild, since you see Club Clit, now take a look around
Dive in, my Billy Ocean, crazy drunk now
Quick to respond, when I come just keep it there now
Move over please, 'cause you're drivin' me nuts
You went past my sugar-wall straight to my guts

To us you spit, and leave that nigga coffin shit

See we gang, we never bought it in the streets, I slang
Peeps I train to hustle, get it take out names
Let me bang and spread it all around the project blocks
I'm sick with glocks, now bitches get ridiculous jocks
Now thug filthy niggaz walkin' through your club with blunts
Grill with fronts, keep Henny on the spill for months
I get trucks from the bitches and the niggaz I crush
And figure the last niggaz that fuck with us

Yo, Mag never roll with a gun, Mag roll with a two-case
Get up in some beef niggaz end up with a screw face
Besides that I got a gang of P-town niggaz with court cases
And they all gettin' life
We can be enemies after fuckin' your wife, or runnin' train on 'em
Piss on a slut, let it rain on 'em
But I'd rather put my brain on 'em
Look at the bitch, she got a frame on 'em

Mag hit it then came on 'em

Get in the back of the Lex' and be out of your tux
Label me ""Alias"" from my respects to crack this case

I'm goin' insane and y'all niggaz, hatin' my thang
Mag the illest nigga spittin', fuck the simple and plain

Put the heat to his back, clap his lungs collapse

Uncut, can't touch

Used to smoke dub sacks now just pound [unverified]

I run with steel, stay in the house, put my dick up in Jill
Poppin' usin' the pill, never did it before
I wanna see how it feel, when you fuck wit' my skill

I make a mil' [unverified], pussy much fine in weather
Fam's wipin' they tongues a little
Mag run for the street, or for the block
Brand new cribs still dissin' the pot

Yo, I used to keep it on the low when I was younger
But now I'm big boss in the game, come let me show you somethin'
So whatchu need is a tech or a four five calico with a nose wide
And women don't know when to slow slide
My A-K in the cut, with my 'dro hidin'
I keep them hookers holdin' my fort, and keep a low vibe
I heard the feds hate me 'cause I'm so live
From five o'clock to four oh five sellin' quarters and dimes

Even Magoo got a watch, I ain't dumb
Ain't no familiars in this place where I'm slingin' it from
I got wholesale weight, that low sale weight
Or any kind of weight that make my dough flow straight
'cause I'm, oh, so great, real thugs, no fake
That's why they down to play me on radio stations and rotations
Thugs hate, everything I stand fo', throw hands fo'
Make plans fo', roll on yo' camp fo'

Laid back in the same colored Escalade
Run over rappers that test the brake
Leave you under the jeep and test your faith
Put it in reverse and, crush your face
Go to court, tell the judge fuck the case
Go to jail, no bail, cut your face
Get it right nigga, you dealin' with apes
I came for the safe now show me the cake, uhh

Listen, as soon I'm on the show you struggle in raps
Anticipate nickel plates, man, right where you sat
Like a panel nigga under your shirt, picture that
How your child's gonna burp when you losin' your lap?
Hey, I'm bringin' the shade, don't floss in the day
Niggaz think they so cold like they jewelry okay
I'm hittin' hoes, respondin' like you charmin' the dame
Crackin' up like, ""Damn, which one of y'all paid?""

A pretty boy got hookers thinkin' that the blows don't trade
That's the day that the curls slide under the braid
I'll give you somethin' sharp to raise that line in your fade
Different ligaments torn for every round that's sprayed
Puttin' hoes into groups and spittin' them up like Jake

Chicks can't even drive straight without them blown they horn

Carry a automatic, keep up on all tactics

Want me to treat 'em with courtesy
But psssh, Ludacris mack nigga bitch get on you purposely
Perfectly, dressed to impress, fresh from the head down

Leave 'em let down, I'm the king of this shit, you take a step down
Admire the merchandise, talk back get slapped twice
Or hand held, I got women sendin' me panties in my fan mail
Pimp hat with a big mouth, A T L, Dirt South
Hoes comin' up short? Hoes finna get cursed out!

It's the fullback blast in the formation grab yo' helmet
Slam the mask out of these hoes and they say, ""What is that, velvet?""
And they betta meet they quota, betta yet betta meet they deadline
And I got hoes who legs go back further than yo' father hairline

From Raggedy Ann and Andy to Daiquiri drinks and brandy
I take 'em off the streets and put 'em back on with a lil' candy
I'm the pimp of the year, I'm a pimp all around
A pimp of the town we pimpin' 'em up, hoes down

I don't love 'em, no, I don't need 'em, no
I might hug 'em, yea, I might feed 'em, yea

Allow me to assemble this flow with limitless style
For all man, woman and innocent child

I have no perimeter
Break all barriers in various areas
My sound is mimicked
Track prime minister, some say sinister

None stoppin the groove until when it's
The climax, some niggas is bitin my hot hats
And followed my drum pattern, but I done that
It's time to change, get more deranged

Feels more strange (doooodooooo)
Follow me through gravel and shallow trees
From mountains to flat plain, to thunder and black rain
Through the dream state of utopia

Woke up to the sounds of that man Timbaland
Five Mexican bitches scopin us
Belly dancin, sayin ""hell, he's handsome"" in Spanish
We was fine until the subtitles vanished

Ay yo, I woke up to a bowl of rice like the Golden Child
T.V. playin like the Poltergeist, must been on overnight
I saw a strong beam of light, decided to walk to it
Could it be the son of Christ, I decided to talk to it

In the halls I heard music shoutin beautiful calls
And I swore I heard a voice say:
It's yours my, gift to you, to do what you choose
But I suggest you do what you do to make the spirits move

I hear ya dude, and me bein a barrel of fruit
But your ears heavenly, when I sit in this chair and produce
Then my hallway darkened
I felt a power surge rush throughout my apartment
And the glance callin like

When you was eatin collard greens I was eatin these dreams
I stepped in dog shit and bit Skid Row twice
Only ice I had put it in my orange Slice

What you know about livin in a jail when it ain't no bars
Handcuffed with no key, world denyin your plea
A third-degree charge when it ain't no crime
Twenty-six years old and I got more time

Phone overdue, baby on the way, low pay
Low rent for your mom, gotta get away
Smoke, hate now, then you want to talk about the ghetto
I'm tenth generation of that, came out the womb with a hat

Polo on and Nikes with a gold tooth
I'm Superman, I can spit from any phone booth

Just remember Mag never feel good, I am the flu

Give me Lifestyles, put 'em on my jimmy, it's on
And peep out my manuscript

And I ain't playin' games when I heart
And leave Mag hangin' hard suit with Christopher Darden

I take about a hour to bust
Chickens wanna get with Mag so they makin' a fuss

Uhh, uhh, uhh - since I got bigger (bigger)
I'm over here and why'all recite Tim's my nigga (nigga)
Like I just figure (figure)
And my tracks didn't help niggaz

So for rememdy I pound niggaz
Like I keep 'em in DJ's for that new Jigga
Like them forty-two Girbauds
I pocket every demo, like Timbaland - he's that next nigga

Confirmed by people that she can blow
Convinced Booker T she's the next to go
Now I'm checkin every joint and every unit I sold
Once I'm deep in the dough, I'm deep with a crew

In the 80's why'all screamed like the movie is through
Why'all screamin this is ""Nutty Professor: Part II""
To ""Eyes Wide Shut"" to whoever I choose
I can appreciate a Kidman to a, Tom Cruise

To a, fast food, I'm strictly drive-through
The money I gave dudes I basically raised fools

I'm drinkin and smokin and stressin, go to church for confession
Down on my knees, beggin to God, show me the path
My label is jerkin me workin me so the devil can lurk in me

Sick of niggaz bitchin, wishin I'd fail
Tell 'em Mag be the rap effin Kenan and Kel
I'm spittin the version of verses curses over the churches
Rappin mo' iller than thriller Manila and give you salmonella

Stop, the press!
Bitch, you can't afford that dress, you can't afford that hairdo

Petey in the back of us, with his range rov

Bold ladies sittin' in back, one ridin' in the front
No smokin' in here, so put out your freakin' blunt
This how we gon' do it, so pay attention to the rules
Women in sexy gear, draws down and no shoes

That's why we keep it live, 'cause we keep ours alive

Layin' in traffic, shiftin' gears in the automatic
Tryin' to get past this old couple in a Maverick

Beepin' my horn at 'em, flickin' on my hazards
G. callin' me, on his cell phone laughin'
Thinkin' his chick hang out the sunroof flashin'
I done went in the grass, like to kill a rabbit

Swerve back into traffic, radio blastin'
Slammed on the brakes, ya old bastard
Tim zig-zaggin', hell, he in the back
And girls sittin' on the trunk, droppin' wine glasses

Wind blowin' dresses up, showin' off the panties
Polka-dot stripe thongs crammed in they fannies

Like why Taco Bell drive-through so damn slim

I'm out north too, no top on the Benz
Big body, too, just like I walked out the gym
Man, I'm speeding through, not just feeling the wind
Look, the needle to the gas tank is right at the end

Now, I'm needing to sin, lying again
Pumpin' gas in the Benz with no money to spend
And every kid that walk in, cashier turning again
So it's a good thing that lady walked in her twins

All I do is listen to Eightball, with the hoes on call
High dank in my gas tank and eat raw franks
Grill in my bed and serve two steak and siemen
And I'm scheming on your daughter
With on condom and Clairborne

Don't get it twisted, I'm gold toothed and two fisted
Both arms ready to roll, chrome-wristed
I'm past being beserk, I go to work
Tell the boss, ""Go 'head
Give me some sugars and hot sauce""

With an a track of Diana Ross playing
And drunk off some moonshine
I passed out and woke up at noontime
Thought it was crack of dawn, but ass was in my face
Said them draws was Versache, I thought she had Versace

To ya bootleggers we breaking off both of ya legs

The run away slave I, Mistameanor
Escaping from all ya fraudulent players
Last but not least, the heavyweight champion, Mr. Mosley

[Verse 1: Timbaland]
It's been a long time, I shouldn't have left you
Without some little nieces and nephews
To cover all the beats, and the rhymes I been through
Time's up, sorry I left you
Thinking of this, I keep repeating them hits
Like that Aaliyah, Timberlake, or Missy Elliott shit (Shit)
As you sit by the radio, hands on the dial tone
As you hear it, pump up the volume
Jump when you hear them speakers left it off (Off)
Mr. VA 'bout to set it off
Well I don't know what you heard, and I don't know what ya know
Well my folks don' told me, (YOU GOT IT! Oh)

When you say you love me, it doesn't matter
It goes into my head as just chit-chatter
You may think I'm egotistical or just very free
Won'tcha say I go tell it to, TIMOTHY!
People say I'm whack, but they don't tell me so
Let them pretend to be me, then they know
I hate when one, pretend to fantasize
Fact I despise, those who even try
Sweat between my thighs {*sniff*} never stinking
Yo dream is over, career sinking
I told all of you, like I told all of them
Whatcha say to me be, DICK TO YA CHIN!

Sure they bounce to 112, I make a note of what sells
Down here the sign men don't promote it, look at us fail
Fuck it, I'ma just tell the truth as I perceive it
Most of them think our shit is useless, believe it

But me I got a love affair with all things Southern
The dirty is a territory why'all can't govern
We all ain't brothers, but this ain't the bitches neither
And all our rap songs ain't for bouncers drinkin either

We were wanted all along
I was taught to fight, taught to win

Thought that we'd be the last to go

Drove the night toward my home
The place that I was born, on the lakeside
As daylight broke, I saw the earth
The trees had burned down to the ground

Don't give up

It's going to be alright
When times get rough
You can fall back on us

Please don't give up

I can't take anymore
Going to stand on that bridge
Keep my eyes down below

And whatever may go

That river's flowing

Moved on to another town
Tried hard to settle down

So many men no-one needs

Timberline Riders,"My pappy said, ""Son, you're gonna' drive me to drinkin'
If you don't stop drivin' that Hot Rod Lincoln.""

Have you heard this story of the Hot Rod Race
When Fords and Lincolns was settin' the pace.
That story is true, I'm here to say
I was drivin' that Model A.

It's got a Lincoln motor and it's really souped up.
That Model A Vitimix makes it look like a pup.
It's got eight cylinders, uses them all.
It's got overdrive, just won't stall.

With a 4-barrel carb and a dual exhaust,
With 4.11 gears you can really get lost.
It's got safety tubes, but I ain't scared.
The brakes are good, tires fair.

Pulled out of San Pedro late one night
The moon and the stars was shining bright.
We was driving up Grapevine Hill
Passing cars like they was standing still.

All of a sudden in a wink of an eye
A Cadillac sedan passed us by.
I said, ""Boys, that's a mark for me!""
By then the taillight was all you could see.

Now the fellas was ribbing me for being behind,
So I thought I'd make the Lincoln unwind.
Took my foot off the gas and man alive,

I shoved it on down into overdrive.
Wound it up to a hundred-and-ten
My speedometer said that I hit top end.
My foot was blue, like lead to the floor.
That's all there is and there ain't no more.

Now the boys all thought I'd lost my sense
And telephone poles looked like a picket fence.
They said, ""Slow down! I see spots!
The lines on the road just look like dots.""

Took a corner; sideswiped a truck,
Crossed my fingers just for luck.
My fenders was clicking the guardrail posts.
The guy beside me was white as a ghost.

Smoke was coming from out of the back
When I started to gain on that Cadillac.
Knew I could catch him, I thought I could pass.
Don't you know by then we'd be low on gas?

We had flames coming from out of the side.
Feel the tension. Man! What a ride!
I said, ""Look out, boys, I've got a license to fly!""
And that Caddy pulled over and let us by.

Now all of a sudden she started to knocking,
And down in the dips she started to rocking.
I looked in my mirror, a red light was blinking
The cops was after my Hot Rod Lincoln!

They arrested me and they put me in jail.
And called my pappy to throw my bail.
And he said, ""Son, you're gonna' drive me to drinkin'

¡Cuéntanos, cuéntanos si te dejaste besar!

Y paseamos hasta las diez
Y tomamos mucho refresco

por la tarde amor se volvió  Bueno, bueno, bueno
¡Uh! ¡Cuéntanos, cuéntanos si se portaba bien!
¡Cuéntanos, cuéntanos si tu novio ya fue!

Por la tarde amor se volvió  ¡Uoh uoh uoh! 
¡Cuéntanos, cuéntanos si se te resistió! 
¡Cuéntanos, cuéntanos que tanto el te rogó! 

Con mucho miedo mi mano tomó 
Y sin dudarlo se me aventó 
Entonces dijo que me quería 
Ella sabía muy bien lo que hacía

amor se volvió  ¡Uoh uoh uoh!

Vamos a cantar una carta de amor a las mujeres
Para este ritual me gustaría que enciendas la luz de tu celular
Quiero ver luciérnagas que representen la luz de las niñas 
Las novias, las esposas, las amantes
La luz de las que nacieron con el cuerpo de hombre
De las que saben bien amar a otra mujer
A las que luchan por la equidad de genero 
Y las mismas oportunidades
La luz de las desaparecidas que no regresaran
Las desaparecidas que no regresaran, las desaparecidas que no regresaran
A las hermosas regias que nos acompañan esta noche
A las madres de esta tierra, a la madre tierra

Que alegría da
Decirte a ti
Las cosas que ha sentido el corazón
Es que hoy descubrí
Que si soy feliz
Es porque están mis sueños junto a ti

Sintiendo en las palabras emoción
Puedo presumir
De mi gran amor
Tú eres lo más bello que jamas me sucedió

Donde sueño libertad
Tengo que callar una vez más

Que delicia volver a sentirlos
Gracias por estar aqui
Para cada uno de nosotros, la experiencia de timbiriche ha sido diferente 
Porque somos distintos
Y al mismo tiempo complementarios
Es como México, que es rico entre otras cosas porque es diverso
Cuando eramos chiquitos, la connotación de estas canciones era diferente
Porque cuando a las once años decíamos adiós a la escuela
Literalmente nos referíamos a despedirnos de nuestros amigos
Pero hoy, años después, nos damos cuenta que la verdadera escuela es la vida
Y que en cada etapa hemos tenido que despedirnos de seres, o de situaciones para poder crecer
Nos hemos dado cuenta que el perdón no es una idea, sino una vibración 
Nos hemos dado cuenta de que la vida, sí es mejor cantando

No crezcas más
Que te quiero así como eres hoy
No crezcas más
Que me asusta el que vayas a cambiar

No quiero llorar no quiero, no quiero decirte nunca adiós
Mi banca quedo vacía y en todo el salón no hay nadie mas
Adiós a la escuela diré, en ella mis sueños sembré
Dejo aquí recuerdo, me llevo una ilusión

Es posible que mañana
Los problemas te hagan cambiar
Tus amigos, tus hermanos
Te dirán que ya no eres la misma

Y es verdad que con los años
Ves la vida de otro color
Te haces seria, responsable
Y tal vez te olvides de quien soy

Y en el horizonte mas amigos yo tendré
Y de año en año, nuevos días conoceré
Y muchos regalos a la vida yo daré
Para ti mi amigo que otra vez encontraré

My claim to fame
Won't come in the shape
Of hearts and flowers

What will it take
Everything that I know
And all the things that I've learned
To overcome what's next around each turn

How come I've been walkin' in circles
Believin' that the things that I love
They will always be perfect and around

How come I've been needing a purpose
Assuming that the world even cares

That we could all be makin' a change
Fly together like one in the same
Ride together like a charm and chain
But that won't happen 'cause we're d-d-deranged
So addicted to watchin' you laid

From the test that I was given
Just like all the rest is nothin'

Hood times, turn into times in the ghetto
Gotta get the money, but I don't want to use a black metal
But it's temptin, times ain't hirin
Can't go to sleep, 'cause all I hear is police sirens
Street corners, wit black brothers is sellin crack
Nickel D.'s don't cost, 'cause he walks wit a big mack
Hard rock rules, it's easy to get in two
Robbin is a hobby, forget Bobby, 'cause we gettin clue
Someway, somehow, I gotta get it
These brothers I know'll set it off in a minute
Take the gats wit the quickness
Got a hand full of doves, so know you know what a brick is
Next door, they livin poor, they can't eat
Strong survive, but if you weak you sleep on the concrete
Wit blood stains, pants and shit stains
Neigborhood bums up in our alley playin fist games

Back at the crib, a little kid without a babysitter

Crack head die, but not of crack, because he AIDS
Prostitution, what's the solution?
Blood tranfusion, ghetto execution
Branded buildings, lots full of stripped cars
I be damned if I live behind big bars
Save the homeless, that's just the slogan
Can't stop rape, I'm just givin out Trojan's
So pass the dice, 'cause I want to roll all sixes
One got fed, and pull out, so now he want to stick us

A crew is a gang, and a gang is all troopers
No joke, you see the smoke from the gun blast
You better run fast...

In front of the projects, objects are fallen
Hit and run, drunk drivin leads to man troublin
I come from a place where nobody gives a fuck
'cause if you got what we want, point black, you got stuck
Buck buck buck, just what you heard on the streets
Little kids stealin Jeeps, just to make ends meet
If looks could kill, Billy be doin the government
In and out of trouble, causin trouble, he was a troubled kid
Last night I heard a scream... (Ahh!!)
'cause the only time I'm livin lovely is when I'm havin a dream
I got a dog that's wit roaches
'cause I'm livin next door to all the Rotts and the roaches

In the begining there was darkness, then came light
I grab the mic to dis' your ass just for spite, what?
You can't fuck with the flows I bring
Watch the staff I swing (my man!)
It's Timbo King, astonishing, I'm dramatic to the ear
Television tells lies to your vision so, beware
Of the trick-nology sent forth to fool the mind
If you're dumb you're lost, if you're wise you will find that

You scratch, I throw jabs to your jaws so quick

Tant d'échecs, tant de défaites
Ont forgés le mordant, pour encaisser les coups dans ma mentalité
Fauché, sans occupation, il n'y a pas pire
Je ne possédais rien et je voulais fonder un empire
J'ai persisté, dit des trucs vrais, ai été pisté
J'ai insisté et le groupe IAM a existé
Pour de bon, j'étais sincère, j'écris des vers pour mes pairs
Et il n'y a qu'eux qui flippent derrière
De l'attention, ils se foutaient donc j'ai roulé pour ma poire

Ignorer les ragots est la seule solution possible
Le temps passe trop vite pour que j'y prête

Rain, drops fire and snowflakes
Destroy homes that contain the mad evil
All of God's children ran towards the ?
For all of those who did wrong to the ?
Their souls were cast out into the deep
Bodies of the unholy covered the street
And all of God's creatures ate them like meat
Oh father have mercy on the weak
The ones that can't see and the ones that can't speak
The ones in the projects smokin' that leaf

Bit by the dogs, shot by the police

Timbuktu,"För man vill ha vad man vill ha å man man vill ha det nu
Och om man ser en möjlighet att få så kvittar det hur
För vi är vildare än djur när det gäller å ta
Och står någon I min väg, ja då smäller det bra
Ingenting e heligt för nu roffar vi åt
Å kan man tjäna på ett tåg, ja då hoppar vi på
Jag menar, varför kompromissa, varför vika en tum?
För någon annan gjorde det - ska jag vara lika dum?
Jag menar jag vill ha det bra som de rika har
Om dom är hänsynslösa är jag likadan
Men vad dom inte vet e att jag inte har nåt å förlora
Så betänkligheterna för mig kan aldrig vara stora


Alla vill till himmelen men få vill ju dö
Man vill kamma in vinningen, men sår inga frön
Man vill ha sin bit av kakan & man vill äta den me
Folk vill ta tillbaka, men vägrar att ge

Och jag ska göra vad jag gör, och jag ska göra det gott
Och fortsätta till nån kommer och berövar min lott
För vem bestämmer rätt och fel när moralen är död
Och folk mördar ju varandra för sitt dagliga bröd
Staten backar bakåt, företagen tar över
Och dom pratar en massa prat men ger oss dåliga löner
Så mycket skit att man kan tro miljoner magar tömts
Så dom tvingar oss simma runt I ett hav av lögner
Sanningen är numera ett minne blott
Varje sak vi lägger till så försvinner nåt
Ja, detta mina damer och herrar är vad vi är
Men jag hör gubbarna på TV säga dom vill ha fred

Alla vill till himmelen men få vill ju dö
Man vill kamma in vinningen, men sår inga frön
Man vill ha sin bit av kakan & man vill äta den me

Var min sista dag och jag visste om det
Jag kanske hittar svaren I sista ronden
Har missat så många val att det visslar om det
Listan är lång den som vägen dit och dylikt
Kosta vad det vill, till säkerligen ett dyrt pris
Har tänkt på det, men mestadels ytligt
Fel djupdyk det testar en psykiskt
Man får betala för allt som betyder nåt
Sån är lagen, inget alls vi kan fly ifrån

Jag ser det jag ser och ser inget annat
Och det jag ser när jag tittar gör mig redigt förbannad
Vi är på väg någonstans och jag vet inte vart
Hoppas vi kan komma på det medan planeten är kvar
Prylar, grejer, saker är det något att ha?
Men är det sår I hjärtat på dom som plågar oss bra
Jag menar riskerna är många, men dom måste vi ta
För lidandet blir ännu större utan nåt kapital
Konsekvenserna spelar mig ingen roll
Den enda hjälp som jag kan få kommer ju inifrån
Och man kan fråga vem man vill, även de vänliga
Men ingen här har råd att assistera främlingar
Så det hela resulterar I en nedåtspiral
Så vi kör en mano a mano tills den ene är kvar

Backpack full of cans plus a four-four mag
G'd up from the feet up
Blue'd up from the shoe up's how I grew up
Loc'n, smokin' and drinkin' til we threw up (threw up)
At Leimert Park, taggin', hittin' fools up
Ditching my class, just to fuck yo' school up
You don't wanna blast, nigga tuck yo' tool up
But don't sleep, y'all niggas quick to shoot you
Now there's another motherfucker with no future
But Time Bomb much smoother when I maneuver, dope like Cuba
Got em jumpin Disciples to the Hoover

I'm coming ""Straight Outta Compton"" with a loose cannon
Smoke big green, call it Bruce Banner
Watch your manners, at last another blast from the top notch
From way back with the pop rocks, I pop lock witcha
Picture this, Dr. Dre twisting wit Tha Liks
And Hittman bought a fix
Don't trip, it's a Time Bomb in this bitch
Here it tick tick tick tick {*BOOM*}
Wait a minute it's on, I tell it like a true mackadelic
Weed and cocaine sold separate, check it
From sundown to sunup -- clown and run up
The Aftermath'll be two in your gut, nigga what?

We roll deep, smoke on weed drink and pack heat
Requirements for survival each day in L.A.!
It don't stop, we still mash in hot pursuit from the cops
Analyze why we act this way in L.A.!

Gimme that mic fool, it's a West coast jack move
They call me Hitt cause I spit like gats do
Cock me back
Bust caps for my max crew, at Fairfax
Who used to wear Air Max shoes, that's true
But I grew up where niggas jack you, harass you
Blast you, for that set you claim (where you from?)
Mash on you for your Turkish chain, C.K. B.K
Blue'd up or flame, I ran wit a gang
I helped niggas get, jacked for they Dana Dane's
My pants hang below my waistline
I look humble wanna rumble? (yeah yeah)
I bang though, like Vince Carter from the baseline
Don't waste my time
Fuck a scrap in killa Cali, AK's and 9's
One-time's, sun-shines, and fine-ass bitches
Hawaiian Thai, drive-bys, six-fo's on switches

I was raised in the hood called WHAT-THE-DIF'
Where the brothers in the hood, refused to go Hollywood
Slugs for the fuck of it
Anybody hatin' on us can suck a dick
If I catch you touching mine you catch a flat-line, dead on the floor
Better than yours, driving away gettin' head from a whore
It's AvireX-to-the-Z
Fuckin' with me might get you banned from TV
Cassette and CD it's all mine the whole nine the right time
Multiply, we don't die, the streets don't lie
What, so neither do I, I'm bad for your health
Like puttin' a pistol up to your face and blastin' yourself

Five in the mornin', burglars at my do'
Glock forty-five in my dresser drawer
Let 'em come in BLAOW he see the thunder roll
Roll with niggas, who buy fifths by the fo'
And brew's by the case
SLAP YOU in the face with the bass, Dr. Dre laced
Likwit Kings wit Sedans and gold rings
Haters fold the style, but can't find no openings

We roll deep, smoke on weed drink and pack heat
Requirements for survival each day in L.A.!
It don't stop, we still mash in hot pursuit from the cops
Analyze why we act this way in L.A.!

Time Five,"Maybe I should have saved those left over dreams
Funny, but here's that rainy day
Here's that rainy day they told me about
And I laughed at the thought that it might turn out this way

Footsteps that you hear down the hall.
The love that floats on a summer night,
That you can never quite recall.

And you see Laura on a train that is passing through.
Those eyes how familiar they seem
She gave your very first kiss to you,
That was Laura but she's only a dream.",Laura,2008
Time Five,"There's a saying old says that love is blind
Still were often told, seek and ye shall find
So I'm going to seek a certain lad I've had in mind
Looking everywhere, haven't found him yet

Hes the big affair I cannot forget
Only man I ever think of with regret
I'd like to add his initial to my monogram
Tell me, where is the shepherd for this lost lamb?

There's a somebody I'm longing to see
I hope that he turns out to be
Someone who'll watch over me
I'm a little lamb who's lost in the wood
I know I could always be good
Someone who'll watch over me

Although he may not be the man some
Girls think of as handsome
To my heart he carries the key
Won't you tell him please to put on some speed
Follow my lead, oh, how I need
Someone to watch over me",Someone to Watch Over Me,2008

They possess a gift or two

If your heart is in your dream
No request is too extreme
When you wish upon a star

Time Flies,"I can't count all the times or the things that you said. 
It wasn't my fault but it's still in my head. 
You never gave an inch, but you took more than it was worth. 
And you said you hurt when I finally turned. 

Are you coming back around like a game of lost and found? 
Six months down the road, you'll be gone and nobody knows. 
I think it's a shame that it happened this way, 
But your ego played part and it got in the way. 
I think that it's sad and wonder why? nobody knows.",Nobody Knows,1999

Time in Malta,"The medicine that numbed my soul lost its power
A fantasy of serenity crumbles in my hands
Another layer has been stripped away,
Exposing a child made with fear and rage
I need to be the one that's not afraid to call me out,
Show compassion, break me down
I will survive, we will survive

As the roads grow longer I see the elements of my distractions dissolve
Vampire's melt away when they're exposed to suns light
IV has been taken out which gives way to the irritants of reality
But I know somewhere in that place lies serenity

To my friends goes my gratitude, in the end we will survive

I'm singing your name
All that's been blown apart
Has been washed away
When you were out there fighting
Going up against the tide

want you to know
That it still matters to me
You made your vibrations
Without a gun in your hand
To a world that's adding darkness
A night devoid of stars
Descending spiral begets the very thing that
It seeks to destroy

You can kill a liar but you can never kill the lie
I reject your solutions
I reject your violence
And through our resolve
You will see your injustice
And through our persistence
You will be called to conscious

I reject your solutions
I reject your violence
And we're not afraid

If you make us bleed
Every drop of our blood
Will say ""I love you
I forgive you
I love you
I defy you""",Against the Tide,2002
Time in Malta,"With every breath like it's your last
Another moment lost to time
How many lost can you string together
I thought that killing was a crime
Cast to a billion blank faces
So unchanged by acts of you
Despair of desire so obvious
Death processions right on cue
Never fucking getting through to you
A waste of time a waste of fucking space
Another drop you'll drown in your own apathy
I hope you die with a shocked look on your fuckin' face
It's a privilege not a right what the fuck have you don? nothing
Laid down at your feet for you or were you the unpromised one
And when your days have all come and gone will you stand as a fortunate one or will you
Take a stab at this thing called life and make sure you make them fucking bleed
Make sure they never forget you
Make sure you make them bleed
Make sure they never forget you
Make sure you leave them on their knees",Bleed,2002
Time Pools,"To lead a better life
I need my love to be here

Here, making each day of the year
Changing my life with a wave of her hand
Nobody can deny that there's something there
There, running my hands through her hair
Both of us thinking how good it can be
Someone is speaking, but she doesn't know he's there

[Chorus: x2]
I want her everywhere
And if she's beside me I know I need never care
But to love her is to need her everywhere
Knowing that love is to share
Each one believing that love never dies
Watching her eyes and hoping I'm always there

I will be there
And everywhere
Here, there and everywhere","Here, There and Everywhere",

Now you're gone and I`ve received your soul
Will you be mine for real?
As the night silence from the river
Behold the signs and die

Spoken words of sacredness as you
Run for truth and find the key 
That will be blessed by
Moments of forever
You will not surrender
Sail across the oceans
Always bring your sword

End of light the shades will always turn to
The ancient songs of life
Hypnotized and steel will make my promise
Embrace the son and lie

Run for truth and find the key 
That will be blessed by
Moments of forever
You will not surrender
Sail across the oceans
Always bring your sword

Then I tumble out of paradise

Just to change the mood I'm in

See I grew up on a one way
Only knowin' one way
Thinkin' I could do it like a subway
Underground sound passion
And now I’m smashin' these bitches who make they livin' on a runway
Fashion me with a mic now
Might flash a free I might write down

Worst case I'll be down by the river chillin' in my van
I'm in the back of the class with a backwards hat
Tryna concentrate on these pages
And it’s usually math where I'm writin' raps
Thinkin' bright lights on these stages
Dreamin' all along I might get my songs to go and drop at radio stations
I might have failed a class but I'm cool with that you can't top this education

With low ceilings on Pro Tools now that's off the top with no headroom

Timeless Miracle,"By morning light they came to take me away
Their banners swaying in the wind
Out in the rain they dragged me onto the castle yard
I could hear the mocking of the crowd

If only I could I would go back in time
Then I would undo what I've done

The priest gave me my last rites my final sip of wine
Right before my pending end
A growing fear of dying spreading in my soul
Hell or heaven be my guide

With a noose around my neck and with tears in my eyes
I repented the sins of my past

Down to the gallows at the end of a rope
I will die as a sinner I'm going
Down to the gallows where so many have died
By the hands of the hangman

They came down the mountains they came down the hills
To see me draw my final breath
Over the rivers over the moors
To see the madman laid to rest

If only I could I would go back in time
Then I would undo what I've done

I will die as a sinner I'm going

I was finally free
From the chains that had bound me
In the crypts down below

And the nightmare was over it seemed
I was back on my feel
Standing so proudly covered in dust
But my pride was intact

Where to go I don't know
The world thinks of me dead
It's been awhile since I was here

Far Beyond the gates of hell
Tricked the devil broke the spell
Travelled on the river Styx to freedom
Hate and pain I left behind
Done with burning it's my time
To leave the fire gates of hell behind me

Then I saw there was a hole in the sky
God was looking on me
When the angels of mercy appeared
Said its time to leave

Where to go I don't know
The world thinks of me dead
It's been awhile since I was here

Far Beyond the gates of hell
Tricked the devil broke the spell
Travelled on the river Styx to freedom
Hate and pain I left behind
Done with burning it's my time
To leave the fire gates of hell behind me

Like a fire burning up to the night away

Brothers and sisters we pilgrims of our destiny
Open up your mind and see the truth
We've come for the cleansing to purify our hearts and beliefs
To the well of souls we come again

We turn our backs to modern life bigotry and hate
We praise the new sunrise

Dreamers and thinkers we challenge the world that we despise
Gaze into the lake of tears tonight
History teach us but mankind won't learn from the mistakes
Hatred shape the choices that she makes

Into the womb of mother earth the cradle of all life
We turn our pleading eyes

To the wind and the water to fire and the chamber of our lies
We have come to pay a tribute to the pagan way of life
To the earth and the mountains to the valley of the dead we all have come
To cleans the mind and body of the evil in this world

The heavens are burning the oceans are rising overhead
Thrown we are into the lion's den
Darkness will follow the wake of destruction that we bring
So that we can start to build again

We turn our backs to modern life bigotry and hate
We praise the new sunrise

The smell of roses cause me pain but I keep them anyway

Never to return live long live well we'll see each other on the other side
If I could see you again I would give just anything
But would it be enough?

Someone is crying when someone's dying all alone
And you know that it's a crime to fail
Someone is dying and leave me crying in the dark
When night have come to stay

I dream of fields of endless green where you're running with the wind
So far away from misery
I take a step forwards the light and I try to touch your face
In my dream you slip away and I awake

If I could fly away I would fly on wings of gold
Never to return live long live well we'll see each other on the other side
If I could see you again I would give just anything
But would it be enough?

Wake up in a sweat I don't know where I am
I'm blinded by the absence of light
There's someone in my room moving in the dark
Seems strange but I know that its you
You call me without sound touch me without form
You tell me every thing is alright now

The seconds turns to minutes the minute's turns to hours
I'm bathing in the warmth of your love
Hoped that you would stay forever and a day
But the afterlife await your return
Dragging you from me I wonder is it real
A final chance to say goodbye

Show me the cart and I'll throw it away

That I need you and you need me

I've got cold feet, it's a-crazy chasin'
When things get serious, time is a-wastin'
I'd cross my fingers but they don't seem to meet
There's no need to tell me that I've got cold feet, a-ha-ha

Took me home to tell your dad
That you were the best girl I've ever had
I stayed for dinner, I couldn't refuse
I spilt the tea and I ate the news
Ah, you must think you're really neat
Got me tied down to my seat
I can't move, it's hard to think
With cramp in my eyelids and I can't blink

It was sixteen days and sixteen nights,

We go where the work is, my boys, and we work where we can
With the mending and fixing, it's together we stay
Intending our fortunes to try on the old changing way
We come to your cities and we call on your wives
We'll fix up your kettles, please dear missus, we'll sharpen your knives
And we always agreed that together we'd stay
Intending our fortunes to try on the old changing way
At times they grew scanty and the money grew thin
We worked for a song but the money it didn't come in
Now brothers are kindred but hard times betray
And so we stumbled apart on the old changing way
We never agreed to divide our tin
And when you're out of love with your brother, your hard times begin
For the spikes and the brothels, they're shameful to see
But don't you travel alone, boys, this warning you take from me
You must share with your nearest till the end of your days
Or else it's forever you're on the old changing way

My bed's so empty, how I wish I could call
On the painted ladies I know
When you've got no credit, don't hold no sway
With the painted ladies I know
It's a ''thank you for nothing, we'll see you someday''
The painted ladies I know

Leave at home what you value enough
And laugh all your senses away
When you want to love everyone, how can you love
The painted ladies all say
Those film stars and beauties will please you tonight
If you go to bed with a book
But they can't hold a candle to something that trembles
If you need to do more than look

They come from rich fathers and twinkle their eyes
And you're begging them please not to go
When you're starved for some loving, they can make you feel special
The painted ladies I know
If you're seeking fortune, if you're seeking fame
And you're looking yourself in the eye
And God help the children, playing their game
The end of the game is goodbye

They pass through your vision like thoughts in a dream
Your good times are slipping away
It's time to move on or go down with the ship

I'm gonna miss you so much if you go.
And, Hey, Girl! I tell you  no lie,
Something deep inside of me's going to die,
if you say so long, if this is goodbye. Oh!

Hey, Girl! This can't be true,
How am I supposed to exist without you?
And, Hey, Girl! Now don't put me on,
What's gonna happen to me when you're gone.
How will I live. How can I go on.
How can I go on? Hey, Girl!

Tell me, do you love me too?

Honest I do, need you every moment.
In your eyes I read such strange things,
But your lips deny they're true,
Will your answer really change things
Making me blue?

I'm afraid some day you'll leave me,
Saying ""can't we still be friends""

Never know how much I care
When you put your arms around me
I get a fever that's so hard to bear

You give me fever when you kiss me
Fever when you hold me tight
Fever in the morning
Fever all through the night

Ev'rybody's got the fever
that is something you all know
Fever isn't such a new thing
Fever started long ago

Sun lights up the daytime
Moon lights up the night
I light up when you call my name
And you know I'm gonna treat you right

You give me fever when you kiss me
Fever when you hold me tight
Fever in the morning
Fever all through the night

Romeo loved Juliet
Juliet she felt the same
When he put his arms around her
He said, Julie baby, you're my flame

Thou givest fever when we kisseth
Fever with thy flaming youth
Fever, I'm afire
Fever, yea I burn forsooth

Captain Smith and Pocahontas
Had a very mad affair
When her daddy tried to kill him
She said Daddy-o don't you dare

He gives me fever with his kisses
Fever when he holds me tight
Fever, I'm his Missus,
Oh daddy, won't you treat him right

Now you've listened to my story
Here's the point that I have made
Cats were born to give chicks fever
Be it Fahrenheit or centigrade

They give you fever when you kiss them
Fever if you live and learn
Fever till you sizzle

Along the lonely thoroughfare

But maybe you'll be there

You said your arms would always hold me
You said your lips were mine alone to kiss
Now after all those things you told me
How can it end like this?

Some day if all my prayers are answered
I'll hear a footstep on the stair
With anxious heart I'll hurry to the door
And maybe you'll be there

And all my grave will warmer, sweeter be,
For you will bend and tell me that you love me,
And I shall sleep in peace until you come to me!",Danny Boy,1994
