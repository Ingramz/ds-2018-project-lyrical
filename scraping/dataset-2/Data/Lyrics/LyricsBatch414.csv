Jason Hainsworth,"Whenever skies look gray to me
And trouble begins to brew,
Whenever the Winter winds become too strong,
I concentrate on you.

When fortune cries ""Nay! Nay!"" to me
And people declare ""You're through!"",
Whenever the blues become my only song,
I concentrate on you.

On your smile so sweet, so tender,
When at first your kiss I decline.
On the light in your eyes when I surrender,
And once again our arms intertwine

And so, when wise men say to me
That love's young dream never comes true,
To prove that even wise men can be wrong,
I concentrate on you.",I Concentrate on You,2009
Jason Hann,"Walking in this time with no direction
Looking around for the light of day
Stone clouds are building all around me now
Trying so hard to block the suns rays

Searching for friends I can't seem to find
Looking for a more peaceful state of mind
Can't seem to see what's out there right in front of me
But if you know, just let me know that you see

[Chorus]
Climb, climb up the mountain side
See what you see
Run down the other side
Climb, climb up the mountain side
You can set yourself free
Fly to the other side
Got to fly away
Fly away
Fly away
Fly away

Seem to be stuck here, fumbling for a decision
Looking around for some direction
I don't think I'm lost
Just stuck here with no decision

Just like a dream except I know that I'm here
Think I could see the things that eluded me
Think I could find the key to these city dreams
I've got to try a little harder now
Look a little closer, I think I can see the light

[Chorus]",Climb,2004
Jason Hann,"Hey, Hey, I'm out on the road
Hey, Hey, I'm out on the road
Got no worries, get in the car and roll!
Hey, hey, I'm headed way down south
Hey, hey, I'm headed way down south
Well I hear that cajun music, really makes you jump and shout!",On the Road,2004
Jason Hann,"As I ramble around on the outskirts of town
Visions from the past fill my mind
I remember the day that you went away
And each and every tear that I cried
Chorus:
Autumn chill cuts the air
Leaves blow through the sky
I feel your spirit everywhere
I can hear you sigh?.restless wind
I look back on the past, time has gone by so fast
Since those trips to the hills where you lived
When I was young you were always so strong
You seemed to have the world on a string
Chorus
Roots run deep 
And you ran faster than the wind
Roots run deep
I still feel all the love you send
Chorus
I turn back towards my home but I don't feel alone
Like I did when I left for the night
?Cause you're right here with me and now I can see
The spirit and the soul never die
Chorus",Restless Wind,2004
Jason Hann,"[Chorus]
I've been waiting for the snow to fall
I've been waiting for the snow to fall
I've been waiting for the snow to fall
And cover us all
Yeah, I've been waiting for the snow to fall

I've been watching the moon as it grows
I've been watching the moon as it grows
I've been watching the moon as it grows
And shines down below

I've been looking deep into your eyes
I've been looking deep into your eyes
I've been looking deep into your eyes
you'll never be mine

[Chorus]

[Repeat: x2]
I've been spinning 'round the wheel of life
I've been spinning 'round the wheel of life

Yeah, I've been spinning 'round the wheel of life",'Round the Wheel,2004

Jason Howard,"When I worked in the mill weavin' at a loom
I'd gaze absent minded at the roof
And half the time the shuttle oh tangle in the threads
And the warp get mixed with the woof, if I loved you

But somehow I can see
Just exactly how I'd be

If I loved you, time and again I would try to say
All I'd want you to know
If I loved you, words wouldn't come in an easy way
Round in circles I'd go

Longing to tell you, but afraid and shy
I'd let my golden chances pass me by
Soon you'd leave me, off you would go in the mist of day
Never, never to know, how I loved you, if I loved you

Jason Howard,"Clothes must play a part 
To light an eye, to win a heart; 
They say a gown can almost speak, 
If it is chic. 
Should you select the right effect, 
You cannot miss, 
You may be sure, 
He will tell you this. 

Lovely to look at, 
Delightful to know and heaven to kiss. 
A combination like this, 
Is quite my most impossible scheme come true, 
Imagine finding a dream like you! 
You're lovely to look at, 
It's thrilling to hold you terribly tight. 
For we're together, the moon is new, 
And oh, it's lovely to look at you tonight! 

What appeals to me 
Is just your charm and dignity,
Not what you wear, 
But just an air, of great repose. 
You are quite perfect from your head down to your toes 
Both night and day, 
I am moved to say. 

Lovely to look at, 
Delightful to know and heaven to kiss.

On this, our weddin' day
Do not forsake me, oh my darlin'
Wait, wait along

I do not know what fate awaits me
I only know I must be brave
And I must face a man who hates me
Or lie a coward, a craven coward
Or lie a coward in my grave

Oh, to be torn 'twixt love and duty
S'posin' I lose my fair-haired beauty

Vowed it would be my life or his'n

What will I do if you leave me?

That ol' man river
He don't say nothing
But he must know something

Jason Isbell,"You said you heard of me so why are you so afraid?
Some minor changes made, you'll miss the big parade
Another filthy day, another Hollywood sign
You missed the caution line and you just walked right in
You walked right in

There's a body there, somebody you once knew
He took a liking to your conversation cues
The way you cut your hair, the time you did it yourself
You're lack of hired help, the way you fit right in
The way you fit right in

'Cause you're a brand-new kind of actress
You're a brand-new kind of actress
You're the same old stubborn waitress, baby
You're a brand-new kind of actress

You swim the other way, you put your seed upstream
So many hopes and dreams, so many in-betweens
Your new reality, just make yourself at home
He's always watching me, he's never been alone
So you just walked right in

'Cause you're a brand-new kind of actress
You're a brand-new kind of actress
You're the same old stubborn waitress, baby
You're a brand-new kind of actress

You little greasy guy, I don't care what you did
In 1965 before the wife and kid
I'll leave my jacket on, so sorry, I can't stay
Just put the piece away

Just put the piece away and let me call a cab
We'll go our separate ways, we'll go our separate ways
Just put the piece away, I don't care what you did
Back in younger days, just put the piece away, get it away

'Cause I'm a brand-new kind of actress
I'm a brand-new kind of actress
I'm the same old stubborn waitress, baby
I'm a brand-new kind of actress

Jason Isbell,"My door is locked, my debts are paid
I'll do the Chicago promenade
My back was turned I did not see
That shadow climbing up on me

I took my turn at fixing hearts
But that goes bad before it starts
I'm desperate now, I must say
I'll do the Chicago promenade

If I die now before I'm old
My story will be less than told
There's so much more to suffer through
Before I meet again with you

And I've tried so hard and I've been so blind
I thought we could all grieve, one at a time

I lost a friend, it felt like five
A man who wouldn't compromise
I'll think of him on New Year's day
And do the Chicago promenade

",Chicago Promenade,2007
Jason Isbell,"Standing in the window with his tongue hanging out
Like the king of something evil in a year-long drought
With a dirty white suit, a big white hat
A bullet in his pocket, no matter where he's at
He's trouble, but ain't we all?
Trouble, but ain't we all?

His daughter was a looker but five'll get you ten
He dressed her like a hooker and she smelled like sin
She had a rag top car, she made good grades
She didn't like her daddy 'cause he wouldn't let her date
She was trouble, but ain't we all?
Trouble, but ain't we all?

Don't work for him boy, it's like selling your soul
He?ll turn his back and leave you way down in a hole
His daddy wasn't a good man, he owned most of the town
He bought up all the farmland and tore up all the ground

He covered up the county with stone and creosote
Came to football games in a new fur coat
Had a real big wife, a real big grin
He gave thanks to Jesus for the shape that he was in
He was trouble, oh but ain't we all?
He was trouble, but ain't we all?

Big sign on the roadside, telling me how to live
A couple things that he done, real hard to forgive
So don't work for him, boy, it's like selling your soul
He'll walk away and he'll leave you way down in a hole
",Down in a Hole,2007
Jason Isbell,"What can you see from your window?
I can't see anythin' from mine
Flags on the side of the highway
And scripture on grocery store signs

Maybe eighteen was too early
Maybe thirty or forty is too
Did you get your chance to make peace with the man
Before He sent down his angels for you?

Mamas and grand mamas love you
'Cause that's all they know how to do
You never planned on the bombs in the sand
Or sleepin' in your dress blues

Your wife said this all would be funny
When you got back home in a week
Turn twenty two and we'd celebrate you
In a bar or a tent by the creek

Your baby would just about be here
And your very last tour would be up
But you won't be back, they're all dressin' in black
Drinkin' sweet tea in Styrofoam cups

Mamas and grand mamas love you
American boys hate to lose
You never planned on the bombs in the sand
Or sleepin' in your dress blues

The high school gymnasium's ready
Full of flowers and old Legionnaires
Nobody showed up to protest
Just sniffle and stare

There's red, white and blue in the rafters
And there's silent old men from the Corps
What did they say when they shipped you away
To fight somebody's Hollywood war?

Nobody here could forget you
You showed us what we had to lose
You never planned on the bombs in the sand
Or sleepin' in your dress blues
You never planned on the bombs in the sand
Or sleepin' in your dress blues",Dress Blues,2007
Jason Isbell,"Last night I heard the sirens' song
And I followed it in the ditch
Oh baby, I'm just carrying on
Far be it for me to bitch

Last night I heard the distant hum
Of another damn hurricane
Oh, Sunnie tell me where you've gone
Are you still dancing to 'Purple rain'?

You took my little hand
And took me to your room
You taught me how to want something
I learned how to move

Oh, oh, you made me feel so grown

Last year I heard your momma had
A little trouble with the thin red line
I always knew that you could
Understand and not undermine

You took me to your room
I let my eyes adjust
You taught me how to want something
I learned how to lust

Oh, oh, you made me feel so grown
Oh, oh, you made me feel so grown

All them years ago
You took a nervous little kid
And you taught me
How to slow it down just a little bit

Oh, oh, you made me feel so grown
Oh, oh, you made me feel so grown
Oh, oh, you made me feel so grown
Oh, oh, you made me feel so grown

Jason Isbell,"I got a glass of wine
I got a cigarette
I should be feeling fine
I ain't feeling nothing yet
She's leading the second line
Feel like I'm in front of it
I guess, I am tonight

I got a cigarette
My glass is empty now
I got a little wine
Well, I ain't gonna break it out
I need something to let me down
When I'm down and out
I guess, I am tonight

She told me I took
The best years of her life
And she was only 17
She swore I would leave her
But I didn't believe her
I called it all a bad dream

She's moved on to whiskey now
I've got a Lucky left
Go out and hit the town
But this town can hit itself
My baby's a day away
And I've got a show to play
In Birmingham tonight

There was a time
When she would laugh in my face
Or just sit and judge me silently
I cried on her shoulder
All the things that I told her
Guess, I didn't say
Didn't say enough about me

Now hurricanes and hand grenades
Are the only things
That gets you off my mind
But I'm a day away
And I've got a show to play
In Birmingham tonight

I'm a day away
And I've got a show to play
In Birmingham tonight

Jason Isbell,"In a razor town you take whoever
You think you can keep around
There's an echoed sound
That permeates the sidewalk
Where she shuffles 'round

It's a big machine
It used to be the avenue of changing dreams
And she's a lonely thing, sweeping up the glitter
While she pulls the strings

Take a long last look
Before she turns to stone
And what the last man took
And what was long, long gone

The way it used to be
I wasn't there to see it working properly
And now it seems to me
That both of you are suffering

You know I've heard her say
That you're the only reason she's alive today
And I just turned away
Thinking maybe she was right

So, say your last goodbye
Make it short and sweet
There ain't no way for you to fly
With her hanging on your feet

Let her go out if she wants to
And if she don't, go out yourself
Don't take sorry for an answer
Unless you really want what's left

'Cause in a razor town
The only thing that matters
Tends to bring you down
And there's no way around
But maybe you can barrel through
'Cause a razor ain't no good for you

",In a Razor Town,2007
Jason Isbell,"You watch every move
And call it slide of hand
You know, it's what I do
But never who I am, never who I am

Started on the street
With cards and dollar bills
Shuffling my feet
But never could be still, never could be still

And I am an orphan man but ain't we all?
I can make myself disappear
I am an orphan man but ain't we all?
And I know somewhere worse than here

I had a bride, I sawed her in half
Couple people cried
Most of them just laughed
Most of them just laughed

Well, I had a son
Strong of hand and will
I taught him how to run
But never how to steal, never how to steal

And I am an orphan man but ain't we all?
And I can make myself reappear
I am an orphan man but ain't we all?
And I could be somewhere worse than here

I was called amazing
And I make folks believe
With nothing in my pockets
And nothing up my sleeve, yeah

I am an orphan man but ain't we all?
I can make myself disappear
I am an orphan man but ain't we all?
And I know there's somewhere worse than here
Worse than here, worse than here

Jason Isbell,"Ten years out of high school, still no idea what to do
You took him home from a nightclub, he took a nightclub to you
Now I watch from the window, too guilty to scream
My feet are like steel, I might be in a dream

Well, every time I see you, you look bigger than you did the day before
And even though I know it's not my fault, I wish it was
I can only ride the elevator all night long from floor to floor
And I can only stand outside your window in the dust

So how about a shotgun wedding? What about your dignity?
What about a different setting? What about me?
All your daddy's wishes honored, all of that security
How about a shotgun wedding? What about me?

I guess I'm a loner, some call me a freak
I saw you in the hallway, too guilty to speak
Now I sleep in the daytime and I sleep on the floor
I dial your number and I knock on your door

But every time I hear your voice or footsteps, I get frozen in my place
And I have to struggle for the courage just to run
I can see the eyes of all the ones that left you glowing in your face
And I just wanna help you with this life that you've begun

So how about a shotgun wedding? What about your dignity?
What about a different setting? What about me?
All your daddy's wishes honored, all of that security
What about a shotgun wedding? What about me?

Jason Isbell,"You can't make a woman sleep alone
You can't make a woman sleep alone
You can't give her loving on the phone
You can't make her stay her ass at home

But you try, don't you? You try, don't you?
Just wanna die, don't you, when she runs?

You can't tell her nothing she don't know
You can't tell her nothing she don't know
She'll chop down every living thing you grow
But you can't take her with you when you go

But you try, don't you? You try, don't you?
Just wanna die, don't you, when she runs?

Take a year and go back home
Where the wind comes sweeping through the plains
You ain't seen her in a while
But she loves you just the same

You can't stop that ringing in your ear
You can't stop that ringing in your ear
And you can't make the highway disappear
You can't make her love you out of fear

But you try, don't you? You try, don't you?
Just wanna die, don't you, when she runs?

Take a year and go back home

Jason Isbell,"I moved into this room, if you could call it that, a week ago.
I never do what I'm supposed to do.
I hardly even know my name anymore.
When no one calls it out, it kinda vanishes away.

I can't get to sleep at night. The parking lot's so loud and bright.
The A.C. hasn't worked in twenty years.
Probably never made a single person cold,
but I can't say the same for me. I've done it many times.

Somebody take me home through those Alabama pines.

You can't drive through Talladega on a weekend in October.
Head up north to Jacksonville. Cut around and over.
Watch your speed in Boiling Springs.

If we pass through on a Sunday, better make a stop at Wayne's.
It's the only open liquor store north, and I can't stand the pain
of being by myself without a little help
on a Sunday afternoon.

I needed that damn woman like a dream needs gasoline.
I tried to be some ancient kind of man,
one that's never seen the beauty in the world,
but I tried to chase it down... tried to make the whole thing mine.

Jason Isbell,"If there's one thing I can't stand
It's this bar and this cover band
Trying to fake their way through 'Castles Made of Sand'.
That's one thing I can't stand.

If there's one thing I can't take
It's the sound that a woman makes
About five seconds after her heart begins to break.
That's one thing I can't take.

She should be home by now but she ain't.
I should've gone by now but I cain't.

It's like you're chewing on a foreign thing
And you won't get to sleep 'till dawn if it don't rain.

It's having to cook and trying to date.
Busting ass all day to play 'hurry up and wait.

Made it out to the truck without breaking down

Sneak a bottle up the bleachers and forget my name
These 5A bastards run a shallow cross
It's a boy's last dream and a man's first loss

And there's no one left to ask if I'm alright
I'll sleep until I'm straight enough to drive, then decide
If there's anything that can't be left behind

The doctor said Daddy wouldn't make it a year
But the holidays are over and he's still here
How long can they keep you in the ICU?
Veins through the skin like a faded tattoo

Was a tough state trooper 'til a decade back
When that girl who wasn't mama caused his heart attack
He didn't care about us when he was walking around
Just pulling women over in a speed trap town

When I still had nothing to say
And how I miss you today
May you find what you gave, all that hope
Somewhere down at the end of your rope

Now I know you'll be fine on your own
And your families all need you at home
And the dream was just smoke
At least you all got the joke off the bat
And you were alright with that

Your voice makes the miles melt away
I'll be guarding your place
In the lights on the stage of my heart

I'd carry her to bed, sweep up the hair from her floor

If I'd fucked her before she got sick

The lights down in the lobby they don't shine
They just flicker while the elevator winds

Who traveled light and clearly traveled far
And she's got nothing left to learn about his heart

Cowboy boots for seven dollars more
And I remember how you loved to see them shine
So I run upstairs to get a pair of mine
And there's a painting on the wall beside the bed
Of the watercolor sky at Hilton Head
And I see you in that summer when we met
And that boy you left in tears in his Corvette

I couldn't hold it in my shaking hands, it was awful hard to see
But the weight that hung around my neck, it was lifted, I was free
To be all the things He wanted me to be

And I was shaking and my eyes were closed in some dirty old hotel
An open heart but an empty soul was too heavy so I fell
And there on my knees in my company was a story I could tell
About redemption, it's still ringing like a bell

To pick me up and dust me off and leave it up and on the cross
And I will stay here on my knees till you send for me
'Cause I'm still covered by the ashes of the man I used to be
So tell me please, that you'll send for me, Jesus save me

And I could feel it in my dirty clothes as His blood washed over me
And why I'm getting it, nobody knows, it's just luck for me to see
'Cause I will never earn His firm concern when it comes concerning me
'Cause I was blind, then He came here and now I'm free

So pick me up and dust me off and leave it up and on the cross
And I will stay here on my knees till you send for me
'Cause I'm still covered by the ashes of the man I used to be
So tell me please, that you'll send for me, Jesus save me

Oh and I'm still covered by the ashes of the man I used to be
Tell me please, will you send for me, and Jesus save me?

And drag you out of bed
Make you sit right next to her in church,
Wearing your Sunday best

Ground you Build their whole world around you

Scare off the ones she hates
She'll get a new grey hair and a wrinkle to spare
Every time you come home late
And when you leave to chase that dream,
She's gonna cry when she walks by your empty room
She'll call and sing you happy birthday,
When everybody else forgets On your wedding day,
She'll joke and say,
""Hey,
Where are my grandkids?"" Oh,
And when she finally gets 'em
She'll spoil 'em rotten the way her mama did with you

Ground you

Jason McCoy,"I was dyin in that small town, dreamed of headin southbound
So I hitched down I-65
I climbed into her trans am, an hour below of Burmingham
She was headin home and I was there for the ride
Started talkin nonsense an' she was laughin at my accent
Wound up on the Alabama shore
There was magic in the night air an' a gulf breeze in her blonde hair
That's what my soul's searchin for

Southern moonlight, southern daughter
She led me down to the water
As we lay on that cool, white sand
I was born again in Dixieland

We drank from a mason jar, underneath a blanket of stars
And I said 'do you believe this is meant-to-be?'
An' she told me 'well I believe the front porch swings
The song that the cricket sings-
And I believe you belong down here with me

Southern moonlight, southern daughter
She led me down to the water
As we lay on that cool, white sand
I was born again in Dixieland

We watched the twilight fade, there by the ocean waves
And it made me feel at home
An' I knew I'd found my place, lost in her embrace
I was baptized in her arms

She led me down to the water

Jason McCoy,"She does her best to keep me on the straight and narrow path 
But there's little she can do standing in the aftermath 
She just says a little prayer
And slowly wipes a tear from her eye 
I've always run faster than my Guardian Angel can fly 

I've been blinded by wonder lust when it was all in vain 
Drove 90 miles an hour straight down lovers lane 
And those tiny wings couldn't slow me down 
No matter how hard they'd try 
I've always run faster than my Guardian Angel can fly

Where Angels fear to tread
Only fools rush in 
And there's very little mercy at the mercy of the wind 
When the rain starts to fall
And there's no place to hide 
I can hear her softly cry 

I've got this tattoo on my memory
A broken heart of glass 
Permanent reminders of loving way too fast 
And this hunger deep inside of me
That I still can't satisfy 
I've always run faster than my Guardian Angel can fly

Well maybe there's some shadow that I'm trying to leave behind 
Maybe there's some rainbow pot of gold I'm trying to find 
But I always learn the hard way

Drivin' by the drive in movies
Started thinkin' 'bout me and Suzie
And how we used to spend those Saturday nights
Later on we'd be out cruisin'
Dashboard drummin' to our favorite music
Kissin' on the porch till her mama flashed the light
We had the world in the palm of our hands
I guess fate had other plans

This used to be our town
There wasn't a back road we hadn't been down
This used to be our town
Every inch is still sacred ground
Now I'm driving these streets and her sweet memory
Still makes my heart pound
This used to be our town

Suzie cried the day that I left for college
Didn't give a damn about higher knowledge
All she really wanted was a family
When I got back there was nothin' I could do
Her first baby was almost two
I guess she's doin' fine without me
Now some thing's change and some thing's don't
Some thing's wait and some thing's won't

With my nose to the grind 
If I don't loosen up these chains 
I'm gonna lose my mind 

Been on the straight and narrow far too long 
I'm heading downtown 
And the Devil's tagging along 
Lord have mercy on my soul 
I feel a sin coming on 

I'm helpless as a child 
When the neon calls my name 
I'm drawn to pretty ladies like a moth to a flame 
That sweet perfume makes it hard to tell my right from my wrong

And the Devil's mighty strong

But tonight I hope the angels turn and look the other way 
I fight the urge, every time 
But to tell the truth 
Tonight that apple's looking mighty fine 
I can feel a fever deep down in my bones 
Lord have mercy on my soul 
I feel a sin coming on 

Well I ain't exactly good 
And I ain't exactly bad 
I ain't the smartest child that my momma ever had 
I never seem to leave temptation alone

Jason Michael Carroll,"My little girl met a new friend
Just the other day
On the playground at school
Between the tires and the swings

But she came home with tear-filled eyes
And she said to me, ""Daddy, Alyssa lies.""

Well I just brushed it off at first
'Cause I didn't know how much my little girl had been hurt
Or the things she had seen
I wasn't ready when I said, ""You can tell me.""

And she said

Alyssa lies to the classroom
Alyssa lies everyday at school
Alyssa lies to the teachers
As she tries to cover every bruise

My little girl laid her head down that night to go to sleep
As I stepped out the room, I heard her say a prayer so soft and sweet
""God bless my mom and my dad
And my new friend, Alyssa
I know she needs you bad.""

Because Alyssa lies to the classroom
Alyssa lies everyday at school
Alyssa lies to the teachers
As she tries to cover every bruise

I had the worst night of sleep in years
As I tried to think of a way to calm her fears
I knew just what it was I had to do
But when we got to school on Monday, I heard the news

My little girl asked me why everybody looked so sad
The lump in my throat grew bigger
With every question that she asked
Until I felt the tears run down my face
And I told her that Alyssa wouldn't be at school today

'Cause she doesn't lie in the classroom
She doesn't lie anymore at school
Alyssa lies with Jesus
Because there's nothin' anyone would do

Tears filled my eyes when my little girl asked me why
Alyssa lies
Daddy, tell me why

And we lend each other shoulders when someone breaks our hearts.

Jason Michael Carroll,"I got a little game that I play
And I call it 'try to beat the morning paper home'
I ain't very good but I get a lot of practice
Even won once a month ago
Of course there was a girl involved that wasn't gonna let me rest
But I've always said that I can sleep when I'm dead

If there's somethin' goin' on within a hundred miles from home
You're gonna hear my V-8 sing
Long as I can beat the train and they got a passing lane
Baby, I ain't gonna miss a thing
Life's too fun and I'm too young and the night ain't over yet
Like I said, I can sleep when I'm dead

It ain't no fun if you ain't got money
So I always make it in to work
The trick is to leave at least a half an hour
To brush my teeth and change my shirt
Keep a closet full of Red Bull and Visine to hide the red
I don't need the rest, I can sleep when I'm dead

If there's somethin' goin' on within a hundred miles from home
You're gonna hear my V-8 sing
Long as I can beat the train and they got a passing lane
Baby, I ain't gonna miss a thing
Life's too fun and I'm too young and the night ain't over yet

Smell of the rain takes me back again
To a morning just like this clouds filled the sky
And every time I I think about that day I said goodbye

And all my tears start falling down like the rain
So let it rain let it rain

We'd talk about forever and how we'd share our lives
It never crossed my mind I'd be without you here tonight

Standing there across the room, I get so lost in the way you move
It makes me reminisce back to years ago on a night like this
Teary eyed as you took my hand, and I told you that I'd be your man
So many have come, so many things have gone
One thing that's stayed the same is our love is still growing strong

Baby, just look at us: all this time, and we're still in love
Something like this just don't exist
Between a backwoods boy and a fairy tale princess
People said it would never work out

It feels good to prove 'em wrong
Living our love song

Oh darling, would you look at me
With my heart beating fast and my shaking knees
It's pretty hard to believe after all these years I still need you this badly
You're dancing in my arms with a spotlight moon in a sea of stars

Say I love you without a sound

No matter what I do

I just can't turn around, walk away

Jason Michael Carroll,"On a three hour flight from Memphis to LA
I was silently celebrating my first class upgrade
Laughing at my jeans and my boots
Beside those high dollar shoes and Armani suits
When the gentleman next to me said the drinks up here are free
So if you'd like the first one can be on me
He said I'm heading back from business in New York and Rome
Tell me son, Where do you call home

I said I'm from the front pew of a wooden white church
The courthouse clock it still dont work
Where a man's word means everything
Where moms and dads were high school flings
Gave their children grandmothers maiden name
Yes it may not sound like much
But its where I'm from

So we drank that round and then another
There wasn't a topic in this world we did not cover
He said I headed out west when I was barely 19
Just a kid chasing my dreams
I said I'm flying out here to pick up my big brother
He's been fighting the cancer they discovered
But he called last night and said I think this is the end
So come take me home to my family and my friends

Where the quarterback dates the homecoming queen
The truck's a ford and the tractor's green
And Amazing Grace is what we sing
Well there's a county fair every fall
And your friends are there no matter when you call
Yeah It may not sound like much but it's
Where I'm from

And as we stood to claim the bags we checked
He said I'll pray for your brother and did I mention that
Italian suits haven't always been my style
See I was quarterback of my high school team
We took state back in '63
And my wife, she's still my homecoming queen

Cause I'm from the front pew of a wooden white church
A courthouse clock that still don't work
Where a man's word means everything
Where moms and dads were high school flings
Gave their children grandmothers maiden name
Yes it may not sound like much

Why I got so quiet, when you asked last night,
Is this goin' anywhere, and if it ain't do I even care at all?
What is it about me that just shuts down

I don't know why I don't

That I always do, when I'm holdin' you
And that little word of love has been
On the tip of my tongue a thousand times
What is it about me that gets so scared
To let somebody in, to show you how much I care

Jason Michael Carroll,"She was a real deal farmer's daughter,
Raised on corn bread, drank well water.
The girl next door, but a little bit hotter,
Than anything you ever saw.
One Carolina night in the summer heat,
At a bonfire party tucked back in the trees
I was sittin' there sippin' on an ice cold beer,
When she whispered in my ear:

Meet me in the barn, way out in the pasture
Turn off your headlights, park by the tractor
Sneak in the backdoor, so we don't get caught
I'll be there waitin' in the hayloft.
With a kiss on my lips, no you don't wanna miss
Holdin' me in your arms
Meet me in the barn.

Yeah, we could've lit that big red barn on fire
From a spark to a flame burnin' higher and higher
Everything a country boy's heart desires
Was in a little white cotton dress. (Oh yeah)
She had lips that taste like watermelon wine,
Sweet like the sugar on the honeysuckle vine,
Rollin' around in hay bale bed,
All because she said:

Meet me in the barn, way out in the pasture
Turn off your headlights, park by the tractor
Sneak in the backdoor, so we don't get caught
I'll be there waitin' in the hayloft.
With a kiss on my lips, no you don't wanna miss

That sweet love we made.
I close my eyes
And I can hear her say:

Turn off your headlight, park by the tractor
Sneak in the backdoor, so we don't get caught

You're my favorite place to hide,

Shootin' bottle rockets on July fourth

In my f-150 on her granddad's farm,
I slipped a half-carat diamond on the third finger, of her left hand

But it can't see or come to me when I call your name.
I realize it's just a picture inside a frame.

I read your letters when you're not near me,
But they don't move me, and they don't groove me
Like when I hear your sweet voice whispering in my ear.
I play the game, a fantasy.
I pretend I'm not in reality.
I need the shelter of your arms to comfort me.

I got some memories to look back on
And though they help me when you're gone,

Go tell it on the mountain,

She's a pretty denim queen
Bird of paradise eyes

I could sight right those hips

Hey sucker

Are you lonely
Well that's alright
You don't have to say anything
I can always tell when

You lost something big
Something real big
Well we all did

Conjures up the blues
They got my song on it
Want to dance 
'Cause it's just you and me and the gravity

You and me down on division street

And they left us with nothing when they split

Except the cold and the quiet
And the blues to sing about it",Division St. Girl,2004
Jason Molina,"The smoke tastes like gray lead
It's killing her head
She finally let him have it
Here practice yelling at yourself instead

She nearly burned the town again

She covers her heart with her hands and says
A little useless praying never hurts anything

It's like nothing's got a pulse
In this whole damn place
Right down to the clocks
Nothing's got a pulse

Remember darling how quiet it got
Leave her alone, let her go home
So she don't have to see you
How pathetic you can be

So she won't hate herself to death
Know what I mean
She's covering he heart with her hands and says
A little useless praying never hurts anything

That must be her up there
Perfume and cigarette smoke in her wild hair
She smells a little like a train
Hauling lilacs through the rain

I can't tell that she's crying
I'll pretend again
But she sees them total destruction
As she goes running to them

I'm finally showing her the switch
How I learned to hold it
In my teeth
How she's got to keep

One razor sharp bloody piece
Of her old broken heart
How she's got to use that edge to carve
Across her new heart

So it always reminds her
Deep enough to last

Hey oh, never let go of me
When I’m sinking

Oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh, oh

This is my message in a bottle, I hope that you receive it
If it washes up at your feet then open it and read it
To whom it may concern, insert your name here
It’s destiny that we were both born in the same year
Three months apart, but on the same sphere
Staring at the sun, inhaling the same air
This type of love we got, they’ll never get it
I’ll be the Leo DiCaprio to your Kate Winslet
Sometimes I panic but I never take it for granted
I’ll hold you ‘til my lips turn blue like Jack in Titanic
And if I lose my grip, then just promise me this
You’ll keep my love in a locket and always rock it, like

Hey oh, never let go of me (Never let go, never let go)
Hold tight, it’s gonna get hard to breathe (Hold tight mama, hold tight)
Never never let you drown (never), even if we’re going down (Going down)
Hey oh, never let go of me
When I’m sinking

Oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh, oh

There’s times where like
We find it hard
To hold on to something
That was never meant to be held onto
But you let it go
If it comes back it was meant to be
If not, just let it be, c’mon

Hey oh, never let go of me (Never let go, never let go)
Hold tight, it’s gonna get hard to breathe (Hold tight mama, hold tight)
Never never let you drown (never), even if we’re going down (Going down)
Hey oh, never let go of me

We'll walk it alone, stand up tall, then march to the fall

I'm one man pushin' on the California skyline drive 
Up the coast mc brag the most 
I'm pickin up my pace and makin' time like space ghost 

Raising a toast to the highway patrol with the most 
Put my cruise control on coast

They say, ""what's up with m-are-a-z?""

Jason Mraz,"Why are there so many
Songs about Rainbows
And whats on the other side
Rainbows are visions
But only Illusions
Rainbows have nothing to hide

Whats so amazing
That it keeps us star gazing
And what do they think we might see
Oh, someday we'll find it
The Rainbow Connection
The lovers, the dreamers, and me

Have you been half asleep
And have you heard the voices
Well, I've heard them calling my name
Is this the sweet sound
That calls the young sailors
The voice might be one and the same

I've heard it too many, many, many times to ignore it
Oh, who did I think it could be
Oh, someday we'll find it

Jason Mraz,"Esta es la mas dramatica historia
Acerca de una mujer
Bella, desnuda en un cuadro
Que yo tengo en la pared
Y que sonrie al mirarla
Casi haciendome creer
Que del amor no se nada

Dramatica Mujer

She is mostly a ghost
The way she watches over me
She complains when I smoke
But then you do the same to me
She is controlling my brain activity
Knowing when I go to sleep
She will catch me when I am falling hard

Y por su forma de ser
Yo pense que tal vez
Me envolveria en el placer
Me enviciaria a socorrer
La sed de su amor
Que en apariencias me dejo
Dudar sin razon
Porque al final me hace feliz

And it is fine
Because she is with me now
Most all of the time
Trying and saving my life
Thinking not of her own
And always kissing me goodnight
When I just need to be alone
She is so sweet so discrete
She is exactly what I need
Not even make believe
She is not so usual

Jason Mraz,"Our friends on the front porch telling jokes 
And they swing swiftly towards happier times
Expending lines and finding more energy for the effort
And getting distance from that front porch spotlight
But us we found peace in shadows
Long enough to see the monsters rise

Candy's got some space to fill in her daydreams
Living high on yesterday's lie
Talking to me about some 0% interest
And how she got a better deal than the next guy 

And the way the lightning shocked us 
When we were lost and looking down that long missouri highway 
Your hair was longer then and now I remember

Oh the roads unencumbered by cats
They're burning like wet matches 
through my miracle mile mind

You left your thumbprint inside me now for months it seems
But mine only brushes your soft surface
And somehow it leaves me listless
My tongue curls under my lips oh yes

So I can't speak to tell you of the months before I met you
And the way the truth it locked us 
Right about the time after the lightning shocked us

When we were young and missing
'round that small new england byway 
Our lives they were sheltered then and I now I remember
Well its not even being about that anymore
I gotta get you down

Those tiny fragments of perfection
They please me in a time unchanged
When its not the same beginning
Or a long awaited end

If I knew all the words 
I would write myself out of here
If I was all the colors 
I would paint you pretty in gold 
In a picture so I'm told little sister

So now I'm sold little sister
Why don't you tell me about the sunsets in sweden 
And the laws of eden
And how you were the rock of gibraltar
And how they called you foxy
Well that's another whole box of pandoras
That's another whole box of them ties

Slide your foot off the gas 
Before we crash right back into the median
It separates our house from the middle of the street
Talking about our house

Is on the front porch telling jokes 
And they swing swiftly towards happier times
Expending lines and finding more energy for the effort
And getting distance from that front porch spotlight
But us we found peace in shadows
Long enough to see a monster die

We all need to find a little space in our daydreams
Long enough and just so long
Long enough, just as long
Just so long as its long enough
Is it long enough
Is it long enough for me
Long enough for me to chew on

If it isn't

If it ain't 
If it don't

And I'm, I'm over-loved
And I'm feeling lucky like a little boy
Who's hiding under cover
And looking to discover
Every way to play the part inside this darkened cave
The meaning of life, well it starts at the nightlight
Close your eyes and I hope you see mine

And I've, well I've seen a thousand things in one place
But I stopped my counting when I saw your face
Erasing memory, well I feel as though I've never seen a face before
Until I saw your eyes
And they're smiling back at me through my tears
I've been counting all these years, oh
Suddenly the thousand things I've seen were nothing more than dreams of
Of you and me
You and me
Quietly at a standstill now
Fortunately you will, well you'll kiss me, I will
I will kiss you back

Oh the fact of the matter is
And I don't know what the latter is, oh no way
See, I've always wanted to kiss you
But I, I always wanted to run from you
Because I've always wanted to miss you
And I, I always wanted to come for you

While you always say, ""How do you do?""

Bold waves tumble to the season of my heart
Where you have offered my faith and my trust
Until all is lost into the beauty of the day.

But there is something in the way you laugh
That makes me feel like a child
Aspects of life they confuse me
You and your thesis amuse me.

Used to talk together, go to the park together
In all kinds of weather we would share

I'm okay, and you're okay, and we're okay
I'm alright. Everything else is alright sometimes. 
 
Just remember those bones they get broken
And love is not a token of affection
It's not even a real thing, it's a word
So don't you try to but it out with a ring
Cause it's a verb, to love someone
Open up and let them in
Just don't be afraid to set them free again
 
This ain't no heaven, ain't no hell , ain't no in between
Cause there's just too many faces and places in this world
That I ain't ever seen
I'm gonna keep on keeping on
I'm gonna reap on being strong
I got my head on, though misconnected
It's alright cause I do it protected
I got a day job. I drive a cheap ride
Sounds like I'm gonna fine
You only get one life to learn
There's only so many brain cells that you can burn
And life can take a turn and take away that you've earned
And leave you yearning for more, so much more
Life is gonna leave you yearning for more, more, more
Your stomach's gonna be churning
Wanting more, you're wanting, wanting some more.
You're wanting some more, more, more
Do you want some?

I had I dream that mystery was me. Now who else could I be?

I dreamed I went to England and met the spice girls there for tea
They lost one more they're down from four to my favorite number three
But they're still quite spicy as the orange flavor
And oh so nice to do me the favor and lick my icing under the table now
But I gotta leave town mr. Nally, just as scary spice was about to go down on me
And don't ask how mr. Nally and give up the towel mr. Nally and run.

I dreamed I went to Singapore got bored and robbed a liquor store
What for? Nobody knows I only took a couple of Marlboros
Oh but that was all they needed and the criminal was soon defeated
And now in jail I'm waiting for my punishment of caining
So I gotta think fast mr nally watch your ass, wake up and laugh and run

Better Mr run, mr rand, mr mac, mr nally
Mr run, mr man, you got the knack for the rally And run.
 
I had a chance to visit the north pole but it was way too cold to smoke
Oh my nose was freezing I should could use some coughing and wheezing
So I tried it anyway and the place went up in flames
How was I suppose to know you could catch fire to the snow
Oh lord way to go mr nally, way to go, now you're melting the poles mr nally so run.
 
I jumped ship in NYC and headed south to Washington DC
Didn't think I'd go there but played some shows there fancy lucky me
But it is really slow there with our new president on TV
Too many politicians and liberal Christians they're all set out for me
Singing cast your vote mr nally, castrate your vote, no you don't, just run
 
I thumbed a ride across the prairie, I got hitched in Vegas, yep, I got married 
To a lady who loved me she thought it's be funny to gamble all my money
And I got stranded without my clothes, a little bit of fear and loathing heart attack
I got chased by the rat pack once in a flashback. Singing viva Las Vegas.
 
I settled down in San Diego and smoked a joint with java joe
And with a grin he took me in spilling coffee on his chin
And I played my show there and I met my bros there
And with my throw pillow they kindly let me make my bed there

And find out for yourself all the strengths that you have inside of you",Song for a Friend,2005
Jason Mraz,"I've been all around the world
I've been a new sensation
But it doesn't really matter
In this generation
The sophomore slump is an uphill battle
And someone said that in my scene
'Cause they need a new song
Like a new religion
Music for the television
I can't do the long division
Someone do the math
For the record label puts me on the shelf up in the freezer
Got to find another way to live the life of leisure
So I drop my top
Mix and I mingle
Is everybody ready for the single and it goes

[Chorus]
Ha La La La La
Now listen closer to the verse I lay
(Ha La La La La)
It's all about the wordplay
(Ha La La La Love)
The wonderful thing it does
Because, because
I am the wizard of ooh's and ah's and fa-la-la's
Yeah the Mister A-Z
They say I'm all about the wordplay

And it's time to get ill I got your remedy
For those who don't remember me
Well let me introduce you to my style
I try to keep a jumble
And the lyrics never mumble
When the music's makin' people tongue-tied
You want a new song
Like a new religion
Music for the television
I can't do the long division
Someone do the math
For the poeple write me off like I'm a one-hit wonder
Got to find another way to keep from goin' under
Pull out the stops
Got your attention
I guess it's time again for me to mention
The wordplay

[Chorus]

I built a bridge across the stream of consciousness
It always seems to be a flowin'
But I don't which way my brain is goin'
Oh the ryhmin' and the timin'
Keeps the melodies inside me
And they're comin'
Til I'm running out of air
Are you prepared to take a dive into the deep end of my head
Are you listening to a single word I've said

Listen closer to the words I say
We're sticken' to the wordplay
Ha La La La Love
The wonderful thing it does
Because, because
I am the wizard of ooh's and ah's and fa-la-la's
Yeah the Mister A-Z
They say I'm all about the wordplay

I'm all about the wordplay
Stickin' with the wordplay
Ha La La La Love
I love the wonderful thing it does
Because, because
The oh's and ah's and fa-la-la's fall back in love
For the Mister A-Z they say
Is all about the wordplay",Wordplay,2005
Jason Mraz,"Do you know what it's like to wonder?
Do you know what it's like to be alone in love
With the one you adore?
Do you know what it's like to hold her?
Do you know what it's like to feel the way I do?
Well if she only knew

I'm gonna keep on hoping
She catches my smile
And I'm gonna keep on hoping
That she likes my style
And I'm gonna keep on hoping
That one day she'll be mine

Did you ever wish you could get away?

And do you know what it's like to want her?
And to breathe her name
In every song you sing?
She is in everything

I'm gonna keep on hoping
That she catches my smile
And I'm gonna keep on hoping
That she likes my style
And I'm gonna keep on hoping
That one day she'll be mine

Did you ever wish you could get away,
Even for a day,
Where they don't know your name?

Did I ever think I could find someone
Who would be the one to love?

Do you know what it's like to wonder?
Yes I know what it's like to feel the way you do
And this one's for you

I'm gonna keep on hoping
That she catches your smile
And I'm gonna keep on hoping
That she likes your style
And I'm gonna keep on hoping
One day you'll find love

That's why I'm gonna keep on kissing
Her in my dreams

Jason Mraz,"You know you're stunning
You're absolutely stunning
And I'm running always running
And now I'm crying 

It's only cause I'm caring
And if you were more daring
Maybe you'd stop staring
And come over and talk to me

Tell me bout how you've been waiting so patiently
And how you tried but I just turned away
And I'll say yeah well you know, 
I'm shy that way

Shy that way
Maybe I'm shy that way

Ohh you know you're stunning 
You're absolutely stunning
But you're always runnin'
But I'll catch up to you

The way you keep your distance is
Keeping my interest 
So I'll keep it persistent
Ohh maybe someday
Someway, somehow in some town

We'll get together and 
We'll break it down
And I'll ask why you've been
So shy, gotta be that way
Maybe baby, oh love, I like it that way

Shy that way
You know I love you so shy,
Shy that way 

So keep it comin' comin' comin' comin'
Shy that way

There's always too much talking
And I wanna just keep walking
But I keep staring baby
Keep staring
Though I may not know the right things to say
I'll get it out to you one day

I'm shy that way
You're shy that way
Do you like it 
Do you like it?

When I'm shy this way?
Yes I like it 
Yes I like it

Jason Mraz,"I know exactly how you feel,
You were this close to closing deals
Now everything fell from out your hands,
You were forced to decide on other plans now,
You figured it best to just ignore it,
Otherwise, oh, you're just living for it,
And if anyone ever wondered why you did it,
You'd swear they'd never know you sold your soul to the burning, burning, burning bridges.

You know exactly what I want so
I don't have to be so damn up front
No matter the moment where we decide to make our minds up
I'll know a man who may need a new assignment
To hand in his heart and take his last vacation
Attempting to spoil imagination
If anyone ever wonders where he went
I wouldn't say that he spent his time driving over burning, burning, burning bridges.

Burning, burning which is nothing more than the longing for being uninvolved.

Oh, desire can cause heart attacks.
And desire, it won't bring you back",Burning Bridges [Unreleased Demo][#],2006

Jason Mraz,"Friday night I'm going nowhere
All the lights are changing green to red
Turning over TV stations
Situations running through my head
Looking back through time
You know it's clear that I've been blind, I've been a fool
To open up my heart to all that jealousy
That bitterness, that ridicule

Saturday I'm running wild
And all the lights are changing red to green
Moving through the crowds I'm pushing
Chemicals are rushing in my bloodstream

Only wish that you were here
You know I'm seeing it so clear
I've been afraid
To show you how I really feel
Admit to some of those bad mistakes I've made

And if you want it
Come and get it
Crying out loud
The love that I was
Giving you was
Never in doubt
Let go of your heart
Let go of your head
And feel it now
Let go of your heart
Let go of your head
And feel it now

Babylon, Babylon, Babylon

Sunday all the lights of London shining
Sky is fading red to blue
Kicking through the autumn leaves
And wondering where it is you might be going to

Turning back for home
You know I'm feeling so alone
I can't believe
Climbing on the stair
I turn around to see you smiling there
In front of me

And if you want it
Come and get it
Crying out loud
The love that I was
Giving you was
Never in doubt

Let go of your heart
Let go of your head
And feel it now
Let go of your heart
Let go of your head
And feel it now

Let go of your heart

Jason Mraz,"Feeling less than my ordinary self I guess I must be getting older
The fog already heavy on my mind evokes a time that's turning colder
At breakfast the effect is picturesque
The window opens up and lets in
The Santa Ana winds again

She's a silent love song
Never stays long
Does not belong to any person
Though she's opening the curtains in my head
She's a kind of quiet
And always hides it in a flame
She's certainly a hurricane

Strange how such a gust of gentile breeze can ravage hearts across California
You start to grow accustomed to her turn around
She's gone of course she warned ya
She sometimes passes in a single night
And other times she lasts the weekend

She's a silent love song
Never stays long
Does not belong to any person
Though she's opening the curtains in my head
She's a kind of quiet
And always means just what she says
She's certainly a hurricane in bed

And tangles up inside and under covers
Angled in her way seen as a struggle
But two lovers we're always in the end
And the Santa Ana winds again

I've been stealing hearts
Where I don't belong (she's a silent love song)
I'm breathing hard (does not belong to any person)
When you come on strong (like a hurricane)
The more I love (you never have to say you're sorry)
The less I know (Anna don't cry)

I tried to be chill but you're so hot I melted
I fell right through the cracks
And now I'm trying to get back
Before the cool done run out

And nothing's going to stop me but divine intervention

And bending over backwards just to try to see it clearer

To rid yourself of vanity and just go with the seasons

I wake and I'm dialin' and my mind's runnin' to you
No wonder I'm a one woman man
She keeps my heart in a jar on the nightstand

I should tell her that she couldn't be more
Opposite than a foot in the door
There's no one else I would rather go out with
That's hell when I see them standin' there

Me and my mouth, we don't mean to be rushin'
We talk about thee freely 'cause we crushin'
I wanna shake both sides of the butt, yeah

It's when the city lights start fallin' for the sea
While them roads are windin' down
And the flying men'll hit the ground
Every motion is close to the touch
And the coyotes sing when they call on your lovin'

You know we should be, we should be together
'Cause once we rock, we won't wanna stop

You know why, 'cause we want you

Another telepathic rendezvous

Gotta write usin' less emoticons

I gotta figure out the snooze alarm

I wanna play in the park, come on
Now let me see your other upper echelon

And when the coyotes escape to New York
Then the city life has crumbled to the sea
And the girls, all fall to the lost and found

With po-pole position
Automatic transmission with lo-ow emissions

With the love unconditional

I'm a drama abolitionist
Damn no opposition to my proposition
Half of a man, half magician
Half a politician holding the mic
Like ammunition
And my vision is as simple as light

Ain't no reason we should be in a fight
No demolition

I'm holdin' in the heat like a fish-stick
And my phone it beeps because I missed it

I do not answer the phone if
I do not know who is calling
I guess the whole point of it all is
Fuck's sake, can I get a witness

I'm only a boy in a story
Just a hallucinatory
Trippin' on nothing there is
Living in the wilderness

With a tiger spot on my back
Living life of a cat
I just wanna relax here
And sing another rap tune
Driving off on your blind man's bike
You can say just what you like
Or nothing can stop you

Jason Mraz,"There's a picture on my kitchen wall
Looks like Jesus and his friends involved
There's a party getting started in the yard
There's a couple getting steamy in the car parked in the drive
Was I too young to see this with my eyes?

By the pool last night, apparently
The chemicals weren't mixed properly
You hit your head and then forgot your name
And then you woke up at the bottom by the drain
And now your altitude and memory's a shame

What about taking this empty cup and filling it up
With a little bit more of innocence
I haven't had enough, it's probably because when you're young
It's okay to be easily ignored
I like to believe it was all about love for a child

And when the house was left in shambles
Who was there to handle all the broken bits of glass
Was it mom who put my dad out on his ass or the other way around
Well I'm far too old to care about that now

What about taking this empty cup and filling it up
With a little bit more of innocence
I haven't had enough, it's probably because when you're young
It's okay to be easily ignored
I like to believe it was all about love for a child

It's kinda nice to work the floor since the divorce
I've been enjoying both my Christmases and my birthday cakes
And taking drugs and making love at far too young an age
And they never check to see my grades
What a fool I'd be to start complaining now

What about taking this empty cup and filling it up
With a little bit more of innocence
I haven't had enough, it's probably because when you're young

Jason Mraz,"Man gave names to all the animals
In the beginning, in the beginning
Man gave names to all the animals
In the beginning, long time ago

He saw an animal that liked to growl
Big furry paws and he liked to howl
Great big furry back and furry hair
Ah, think I'll call it a bear

Man gave names to all the animals
In the beginning, in the beginning
Man gave names to all the animals
In the beginning, long time ago

He saw an animal up on a hill
Chewing up so much grass until she was filled
He saw milk coming out but he didn't know how
Ah, think I'll call it a cow

Man gave names to all the animals
In the beginning, in the beginning
Man gave names to all the animals
In the beginning, long time ago

He saw an animal that liked to snort
Horns on his head and they weren't too short
It looked like there wasn't nothing that he couldn't pull
Ah, think I'll call it a bull

Man gave names to all the animals
In the beginning, in the beginning
Man gave names to all the animals
In the beginning, long time ago

He saw an animal leaving a muddy trail
Real dirty face and a curly tail
He wasn't too small and he wasn't too big
Ah, think I'll call it a pig

Man gave names to all the animals
In the beginning, in the beginning
Man gave names to all the animals
In the beginning, long time ago

Next animal that he did meet
Had wool on his back and hooves on his feet
Eating grass on a mountainside so steep
Ah, think I'll call it a sheep

Man gave names to all the animals
In the beginning, in the beginning
Man gave names to all the animals
In the beginning, long time ago

He saw an animal as smooth as glass
Slithering his way through the grass
Saw him disappear by a tree near a lake

Acerca de una mujer
Bella, desnuda en un cuadro
Que yo tengo en la pared
Y que sonrie al mirarla
Casi haciendome creer
Que del amor no se nada

Dramatica Mujer

She is mostly a ghost
The way she watches over me
She complains when I smoke
But then you do the same to me
She is controlling my brain activity
Knowing when I go to sleep
She will catch me when I am falling hard

Y por su forma de ser
Yo pense que tal vez
Me envolveria en el placer
Me enviciaria a socorrer
La sed de su amor
Que en apariencias me dejo
Dudar sin razon
Porque al final me hace feliz

And it is fine
Because she is with me now
Most all of the time
Trying and saving my life
Thinking not of her own
And always kissing me goodnight
When I just need to be alone
She is so sweet so discrete
She is exactly what I need
Not even make believe
She is not so usual

Because she fall in love too often, that's what the matter
At least I'm talkin' about it, keep my pattern of flattery and

My shot to mock, you kinda puts me in the tight spot

The hype is nothing more than hoo-ha, so I'm

Looks like Jesus and his friends involved
There's a party getting started in the yard
There's a couple getting steamy in the car parked in the drive
Was I too young to see this with my eyes?

By the pool last night, apparently
The chemicals weren't mixed properly
You hit your head and then forgot your name
And then you woke up at the bottom by the drain
And now your altitude and memory's a shame

[Chorus]
What about taking this empty cup and filling it up
With a little bit more of innocence
I haven't had enough, it's probably because when you're young
It's OK to be easily ignored
I like to believe it was all about love for a child

And when the house was left in shambles
Who was there to handle all the broken bits of glass
Was it mom who put my dad out on his ass or the other way around
Well I'm far too old to care about that now

[Chorus]

It's kinda nice to work the floor since the divorce
I've been enjoying both my Christmases and my birthday cakes
And taking drugs and making love at far too young an age
and they never check to see my grades
What a fool I'd be to start complaining now

[Chorus]

It was all about love...",Love for a Child,2008
Jason Mraz,"Do you hear me,
I'm talking to you
Across the water across the deep blue ocean
Under the open sky, oh my, baby I'm trying
Boy I hear you in my dreams
I feel your whisper across the sea
I keep you with me in my heart
You make it easier when life gets hard

I'm lucky I'm in love with my best friend
Lucky to have been where I have been
Lucky to be coming home again

Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh

They don't know how long it takes
Waiting for a love like this
Every time we say goodbye
I wish we had one more kiss
I'll wait for you I promise you, I will

I'm lucky I'm in love with my best friend
Lucky to have been where I have been
Lucky to be coming home again

Lucky we're in love in every way
Lucky to have stayed where we have stayed
Lucky to be coming home someday

And so I'm sailing through the sea
To an island where we'll meet
You'll hear the music fill the air
I'll put a flower in your hair
Though the breezes through the trees
Move so pretty you're all I see
As the world keeps spinning round
You hold me right here right now

I'm lucky I'm in love with my best friend

Jason Mraz,"A squirrel in the tree is he watching me
Does he give a damn?
Does he care who I am?
I'm just a man, is that all I am
Are my manners misinterpreted words or only human?
I'm human

Murderous crow, hey what you know
What you reading about, what you hold in your toes
Is that a twig, are you a dove of peace
A black dove undercover, with another puzzle piece
Are you a riddle to solve all along?
Or am I over thinking thoughts of human after all

Only human
Made of flesh, made of sand, made of you and me
The planet's talking about a revolution
The natural laws ain't got no constitution
They've got a right to live their own life
But we keep paving over paradise

Cause we're only human
Yes we are, only human
If it's our only excuse do you think we'll keep on being only human
Yes we are, yes we are
Only human, only human, only human
So far...

Up in the major's tree, the one he planted back when he was just a boy
Thinking 1923
Thirty meters and a foot, take a look, take a climb
What you'll find is the product of a seed
The seed is sown, all alone
It grows above, with a heart of love
Sharp and shelter of the animals of land and cold weather breathing
We're all breathing in

The planet's talking about a revolution
The natural laws ain't got no constitution
They've got a right to live their own life
But we keep paving over paradise

Cause we're only human
Yes we are, only human
If it's our only excuse do you think we'll keep on being only human
Yes we are, only human, only human, so far, so far

And this place it will outlive me
Before I get to heaven I'll climb that tree
And I will have to give my thanks
For giving me the branch to swing on
If I ever fall in love
I'll have to give myself a baby
I will let my children have their way

Cause we're only human, yes we are
Only human, so far, so far",Only Human,2008

In the lane, snow is glistening
A beautiful sight,
We're happy tonight,
We're walking in a winter wonderland.

And gone away is the bluebird,
But here to stay, stay, stay is the new bird
He sings a love song,
As we go along,
We're walking in a winter wonderland.

In the meadow we can build a snowman,
Then pretend that he is Parson Brown
He'll say: Are you married?
We'll say: No man,
But you can do the job
When you're in town.

Later on, we'll conspire,
As we dream by the fire babe
We'll  face unafraid,
All the plans that we've made,
We're walking in a winter wonderland.

Other people's houses and not mine.
Some days the clouds paint the sky all gray
And it takes away my summertime.
Somehow the sun keeps shining upon you,
While I struggle to get mine.
If there's a light in everybody,
Send out your ray of sunshine.

I want to walk the same roads as everybody else, Through the trees and past the gates.
Getting high on heavenly breezes,
Making new friends along the way.
I won't ask much of nobody,
I'm just here to sing along.
And make my mistakes looks gracious,
And learn some lessons from my wrongs.

Well sometimes the sun shines on
Other people's houses and not mine.
Some days the clouds paint the sky all gray
And it takes away my summertime.
Somehow the sun keeps shining upon you,
While I struggle to get mine.
A little light never hurt nobody,
Send out your ray of sunshine.

Oh, if this little light of mine
Combined with yours today,
How many watts could we luminate?
How many villages could we save?
 
And my umbrella's tired of the weather,
Wearing me down.
Well, look at me now.

You should look as good as your outlook,
Would you mind if I took some time,
to soak up your light, your beautiful light?
You've got a paradise inside.
I get hungry for love and thirsty for life,
And much too full on the pain,
When I look to the sky to help me
And sometimes it looks like rain.

As the sun shines on other people's houses
And not mine,
And the sky paints those clouds in a way
That it takes away the summertime,
Somehow the sun keeps shining upon you,
while I kindly stand by.
If theres a light in everybody,
Send out your ray of sunshine

You're undeniably warm, you're cerulean,
You're perfect in desire.
Won't you hang around
so the sun, it can shine on me,
And the clouds they can roll away,
And the sky can become a possibility?",Sunshine Song,2009

To rid yourself of vanity and just go with the seasons

Fancy I woke up before my alarm
Rub my mind through my eyes
It's the best I can do
Before it's automatic, habit of returning to you
Though I smile when it happens, almost as if it was magic
It means there's a God somewhere and he's laughing
And I shuffle my slipper less toes to the kitchen
Still low to the ground, but high on living

And I know, I know, it's going to be a good day
Hello, hello, you beautiful thing

Waking up, I stretch my body and acknowledge the makes
It must be something I did yesterday
Pour a cup of liquid gold, because my enginge's still cold

Take the black of the night from the dirt
I can see from the depths of my readjusting eyes
A reflection of yes' in that ever changing sky

I don't need no scenes of voilence or pain replayed
And I feel quite foolish sometimes when I pray
But my thoughts are all I got so I try to make them brave

There’s no defrost and we’re steaming the glass
You and the road have a generous shoulder
We can pull over and say we took the long way

I see you, but not quite

You've got a baby coming
It's a bad idea, me and you

Jason Nevins,"It's been a long time  I shouldn't have left you
Without a strong rhyme to step to
Think of how many weak shows you slept through
Time's up  I'm sorry I kept you
Thinking of this  you keep repeating you miss
The rhymes from the microphone soloist
And you sit by the radio  hand on the dial  soon
As you hear it  pump up the volume
Dance wit the speaker 'til you hear it blow
Then plug in the headphone 'cause here it go
It's a 4 letter word when it's heard, it control
Your body to dance (You got it) soul,
Detects the tempo like a red alert
Reaches your reflex, so let it work
When this is playing, you can't get stuck wit
The steps, so get set and I'm a still come up wit
A gift to be swift, follow the leader, the rhyme will go
Def wit the record that was mixed a long time ago
It can be done but only I can do it
For those that can dance and clap your hands to it
I start to think and then I sink
Into the paper like I was ink
When I'm writing, I'm trapped in between the lines,
I escape when I finish the rhyme
I got soul

You got it
You got it
You got it
You got it
I know you got soul

Picture a mic, the stage is empty
A beat like this might tempt me
To pose, show my rings and my fat gold chain
Grab the mic like I'm on Soul Train
But I'll wait 'cause I mastered this
Let the others go first so the brothers don't miss
Eric B. break the sticks (you got it)
Rakim will begin when you make the mix
I'll experiment like a scientist
You want to rhyme, you gotta sign my list
'Cause I'm a manifest and bless the mic I hold
You want it next? then you gotta have soul
'Cause if you ain't got it, I'm a make an encore
Take the mic, make the people respond for
The are, 'cause that's the way it'll have to be
If you want to get on after me
Think about it, wait, erase your rhyme
Forget it and don't waste your time
'Cause I'll be in the crowd if you ain't controlling it
Drop the mic, you shouldn't be holding it
This is how it should be done
This style is identical to none
Some try to make it sound like this but you're getting me
So upset that I'm wet 'cause you're sweating me
I drip steam like a microphone fiend
Eager to MC is my theme
I get hype when I hear a drum roll
Rakim is on the mic and you know I got soul

You got it
You got it
You got it
You got it
You got it

I got soul (you got it) that's why I came
To teach those who can't say my name
First of all, I'm the soloist, the soul controller
Rakim gets stronger as I get older
Constant elevation causes expansion
I write my rhyme while I cool in my mansion
Then put it on tape and in the city I test it
Then on the radio the R's requested
You listen to it, the concept might break you
'Cause almost anyone can relate to
Whoever's out of hand, I'm give him handles
Light 'em up, blow 'em out like candles
Or should I just let him melt?
Then give him a hand so they can see how it felt
I'm not bold just 'cause I rock gold
Rakim is on the mic and you know I got soul

You got it
You got it
You got it
You got it

Now I'm a stop to see what you got
Get off the mic before I get too hot
I want to see which posse can dance the best
It should be easy 'cause the beat is fresh
Now if your from Uptown, Brooklyn- bound,
The Bronx, Queens, or Long Island Sound,
Even other states come right and exact,
It ain't where you're from, it's where you're at
Since you came here, you have to show and prove
And do that dance until it don't move
'Cause all you need is soul self-esteem will release,
The rest is up to you, Rakim 'll say peace

You got it",I Know You Got Soul,

Jason Nevins,"It's been a long time  I shouldn't have left you 
Without a strong rhyme to step to 
Think of how many weak shows you slept through 
Time's up  I'm sorry I kept you 
Thinking of this  you keep repeating you miss 
The rhymes from the microphone soloist 
And you sit by the radio  hand on the dial  soon 
As you hear it  pump up the volume 
Dance wit the speaker 'til you hear it blow  
Then plug in the headphone 'cause here it go 
It's a 4 letter word when it's heard, it control 
Your body to dance (You got it) soul, 
Detects the tempo like a red alert 
Reaches your reflex, so let it work 
When this is playing, you can't get stuck wit 
The steps, so get set and I'm a still come up wit 
A gift to be swift, follow the leader, the rhyme will go 
Def wit the record that was mixed a long time ago 
It can be done but only I can do it 
For those that can dance and clap your hands to it 
I start to think and then I sink 
Into the paper like I was ink 
When I'm writing, I'm trapped in between the lines, 
I escape when I finish the rhyme 
I got soul
 
You got it
You got it
You got it
You got it
I know you got soul 

Picture a mic, the stage is empty 
A beat like this might tempt me 
To pose, show my rings and my fat gold chain 
Grab the mic like I'm on Soul Train 
But I'll wait 'cause I mastered this 
Let the others go first so the brothers don't miss 
Eric B. break the sticks (you got it) 
Rakim will begin when you make the mix 
I'll experiment like a scientist 
You want to rhyme, you gotta sign my list 
'Cause I'm a manifest and bless the mic I hold 
You want it next? then you gotta have soul 
'Cause if you ain't got it, I'm a make an encore 
Take the mic, make the people respond for 
The are, 'cause that's the way it'll have to be 
If you want to get on after me 
Think about it, wait, erase your rhyme 
Forget it and don't waste your time 
'Cause I'll be in the crowd if you ain't controlling it 
Drop the mic, you shouldn't be holding it 
This is how it should be done 
This style is identical to none 
Some try to make it sound like this but you're getting me 
So upset that I'm wet 'cause you're sweating me 
I drip steam like a microphone fiend 
Eager to MC is my theme 
I get hype when I hear a drum roll 
Rakim is on the mic and you know I got soul 

You got it
You got it
You got it
You got it
You got it

I got soul (you got it) that's why I came 
To teach those who can't say my name 
First of all, I'm the soloist, the soul controller 
Rakim gets stronger as I get older 
Constant elevation causes expansion 
I write my rhyme while I cool in my mansion 
Then put it on tape and in the city I test it 
Then on the radio the R's requested 
You listen to it, the concept might break you 
'Cause almost anyone can relate to 
Whoever's out of hand, I'm give him handles 
Light 'em up, blow 'em out like candles 
Or should I just let him melt? 
Then give him a hand so they can see how it felt 
I'm not bold just 'cause I rock gold 
Rakim is on the mic and you know I got soul 

You got it
You got it
You got it
You got it

Now I'm a stop to see what you got 
Get off the mic before I get too hot 
I want to see which posse can dance the best 
It should be easy 'cause the beat is fresh 
Now if your from Uptown, Brooklyn- bound, 
The Bronx, Queens, or Long Island Sound, 
Even other states come right and exact, 
It ain't where you're from, it's where you're at 
Since you came here, you have to show and prove 
And do that dance until it don't move 
'Cause all you need is soul self-esteem will release, 
The rest is up to you, Rakim 'll say peace 

You got it",I Know You Got Soul (Original Edit),2003

You die, they hope, don't sleep, stay woke
The more money you get, the more it's your fault that they broke
Catch a bullet in your culo
In the hood that's how they do though
'Cause ain't nothin' new, yo

This ain't nothin' new, this ain't nothin' new
Two decker like me man, it's what I do
And you got lied to if they sad to say what I do
This ain't nothin' new, it ain't nothin' new
Nah but maybe to a nigga like you
'Cause round here man, this an everyday thing
No it ain't nothin' new

Never turn down when it's on, I'm front line
Always respected what's real, I want mine
Anytime they shot up the hood was go time
Once you start cuttin' in life, you sold out
If you have some smut on your name, you can't grind
Over reputation and pride we gone die
When the police asked for the truth, I told lies
And when I find God in this booth, my soul cry
Once you off the stoop it's through, you no child
Ain't make no excuse for your youth, or no size
See me, I graduated these streets in 05
Still live and die by these rules, you know why?

This ain't nothin' new, this ain't nothin' new
Two decker like me man, it's what I do
And you got lied to if they sad to say what I do
This ain't nothin' new, it ain't nothin' new
Nah but maybe to a nigga like you
'Cause round here man, this an everyday thing
No it ain't nothin' new

Nah the bars are still lethal
You ain't at the top til the stars are underneath you
God shuffles the deck but the cards come from the people
Speakin' from a place where the odds are under equal
Yeah, end of discussion
Ain't nothin' new, I vocally destroy any production
Go get your crew, put my prints on the semi, I'm bustin'
Grateful, I know the difference between plenty and nothin'
I'm on the block, on the crate, sippin' Henny and puffin'
And even though it's all love, keep your enemies lustin'
Lick a shot off then let two go
Let me off the leash, I'm like Cujo

You had the ball then you dropped it then fuck it
I open up shop on the block and I crush it
Don’t let yourself be the next kiss opponent
No I ain't driving but yeah bitch I own it
Usually niggas get caught in the moment
I showed them a style and they just went and cloned it
Whole ones half ones even zips moving
We ain't even gonna talk about the bricks moving

Gave away more hits than Rick Rubin

Most of them is lovin’ me some of them hatin’ me
Say hes underrated dependin’ on whose ratin’ me
I be destroyin' niggas on tracks blatantly
Basically I'm patiently waitin’ for a vacancy
It ain't hard to tell they all scared to challenge ’em
Money power respect I learned how to balance them
Water melon over the pump the hood silencer
Couple hundred thousand a month is a good calendar
Yea they love to hear the don speak
That's because my dialog ain't in arms reach
Nah I ain't wit the coward ish
First the skinny jeans now they wearin’ blouses
Don't ever confuse wireless for powerless
A nice red wine haze and a sour mix
I'm in the trap wit the blicky
Cigarettes pills and the sticky
If you need somethin hit me
When it's poppin I breeze quickly
To ya door step if ya coppin at least 50
Never mix my feelings wit my dealings
I'm house shoppin’ for wood floors high ceilings
200 or more on the dash if I'm wheelin’
Really these just niggas is mad 'cause I'm chillin’
Face on the masters mother pearls
I maintain 'cause I dominated the underworld
If you sick to ya stomach that mean you wanna earl
The moon and the stars tell you that son is thorough
I'm gettin’ better every week
And I don't talk too much the longevity will speak
They ain't selling you nothing
You think its better 'cause its cheap
With the push of a button I'll get you wet up in the street
Its never been even I'm one of the best breathin’
Ya red shirts might be ready by next season
The spread's too high is nothing I just tease 'em
More celebratin’ this year and less grieving
But I'm always down for a funeral
For a nigga hatin' while I'm tryna do my numerals
Screw faces side glances
6 shooter headshots 5 chances
25 large or 5 dances

You on the opposite side, shotgun will fly
Best part about it, I can stay right up in Yonkers and hide
Keep a gun in the door, that's all in the rides
Until my niggas come home, free all of the guys
This shit is all a facade, thought it was all a surprise
I heard all of the stories, seen all of the lies
Long as the work is official, and the corner supplied

Simple dilemmas become hard for you to cope with
Taking things personal, easily insulted
Doing dumb shit, and don't care what the results is

You just hoping that there's light, at the end of the tunnel
Either that or oil money at the end of the funnel

But you can stumble on a hit, and get rich on a humble

They don't know about real
They ain't even been broke, rob nothing
They ain't never been to jail
They don't know about beef goin' back and forth
Late night, on the block 'til the Mac go off
Nigga just came home, and he back up north
Everybody where you from know your block is soft
Hold up, lemme fill my cup
Let's toast to the boys they ain't never broke up
We done battled everybody and never choked up
All we do it get money, and stay smoked up
I done stuffed my hawk
I park one of you niggas with that industry talk
We the realest everywhere, not just New York
Been eating worldwide, you seen my fork
What you know about me
Street nigga, half the shit I can't IG

You and your homie different casket same pastor same scripture
I’m in the hood where the drugs is never that far away from where the plug is
Homemade corn liquor in the tub is
Down bottom to its hot where the bugs is
Object is to rise up above this
Why you think all the real niggas love kiss
'Cause the gram got people so caught up with likes
Mafuckas forgot what real love is
Check it
Right off the back of them big 18 wheelers
As soon as I get it it goes to the dealers
They been fucking with us I know that they feel us

Jason Phillips,"I’m so high, you can barely see me
Do you know the feeling of being so high?

Between love and hate it’s a fine line
So I stay parallel to the sky line
THC levels is through the roof
When you floating in the clouds you can view the truth
Hush feel the rush from the altitude
Look down on 'em see what they about to do
So you already know what not to do
That Moroccan hashish is like rocket fuel
Yea sometimes it better not to see the ground
Yea sometimes it better not to be around
Always keep a couple dollars and a P around
I might experience turbulence when I see the town
The worlds under me
I’m where the lightning and the thunder be
'Cause down there ain't no fun to me
With that said I ain't going back
I’m bout to blow a sack and I all know is that

I’m so high I can’t see the ground
My life shines so bright can you see me now
Ohh I’m so high I’m not coming down
I won't fade away, this high's gonna stay
I'm so high

Rollin up, money can't folded up
How you gonna say you cold as us
Can’t smoke enough
Diamonds in my chain nah homie it ain't 14 karats
Lil nigga that ain't gold enough
Staying on top while these haters praying I stop and
You niggas waiting on cars while I pull em strain out the lot
You could catch me rolling up reefer, I stay on that pot
And I’m always repping for my gang I know I say that a lot
'Cause I can remember the days before I got paid
Me and my niggas was trying to make our way
We getting on fuck what y'all say
Made some millions and got niggas with me tryna do the same thing
So I made moves bossed up in the game
Ball hard don’t get crossed up in the game
Seen alotta dudes get loss up in the game
That’s why every time you see me

I’m so high I can’t see the ground
My life shines so bright can you see me now
Ohh I’m so high I’m not coming down
I won't fade away, this high's gonna stay
I'm so high

High as the towers before they knocked them down
Teflon like Gotti before they locked him down
Word to the mollies niggas in poppin now
But I’m just chillin just passing the pot around

I’m so high I can’t see the ground
My life shines so bright can you see me now
Ohh I’m so high I’m not coming down

We don’t ride how you niggas ride
Politics to the side no one sicker than I
First the devil will try to conquer
Then he’ll divide
It’s my job as a man
To forever provide
What's the meaning of living
Since you barely survive
If you came from the dirt
Now you touching the sky
You keep fucking wit me
You must be rushing to die
So you better decide
'Cause it's better to ride
I'm 2 slots after the 3rd dead or alive
You can give me the racks instead of the shine
'Cause I been doin' what I'm doin' ahead of my time
If you ain't hearin' what I'm doin' you better rewind
The only thing I'm scared of doin' is federal time
I sold crack out the building several dimes
And I done counted up a million several times
Gold plated desert eagles incredible nines
Better flows better fabrics better designs
Family and loyalty
Then the cheddar behind
I put some money on ya head
Or some bread on ya mind
We ya problem alone
But we better combined
Do it for those not here
And forever confined
And we ain't promised tomorrow
So lets treasure the times
And we ain't givin it away
So lets measure the lines
And keep killin these niggas

Jason Prince,"Baby when I met you there was peace unknown
I set out to get you with a fine tooth comb
I was soft inside there was something going on

You do something to me that I can't explain
Hold me closer and I feel no pain every beat of my heart
We got something going on

Tender love is blind it requires a dedication
All this love we feel needs no conversation
We ride it together, uh huh
Makin' love with each other, uh huh

Islands in the stream that is what we are
No one in between how can we be wrong?
Sail away with me to another world
And we rely on each other, uh huh
From one lover to another, uh huh

I can't live without you if the love is gone
Everything is nothing if you got no one
And you did walk in the night
Slowly losin' sight of the real thing

But that won't happen to us and we got no doubt
Too deep in love and we got no way out
And the message is clear this could be the year for the real thing

No more will you cry, baby I will hurt you never
We start and end as one in love forever
We can ride it together, uh huh
Makin' love with each other, uh huh

Islands in the stream that is what we are
No one in between how can we be wrong?
Sail away with me to another world
And we rely on each other, uh huh
From one lover to another, uh huh

Jason Raize,"Hello darkness, my old friend,
I've come to talk with you again,
Because a vision softly creeping,
Left its seeds while I was sleeping,
And the vision that was planted in my brain
Still remains
Within the sound of silence.
In restless dreams I walked alone
Narrow streets of cobblestone,
'Neath the halo of a street lamp,
I turned my collar to the cold and damp
When my eyes were stabbed by the flash of a neon light
That split the night
And touched the sound of silence.

And in the naked light I saw
Ten thousand people, maybe more.
People talking without speaking,
People hearing without listening,
People writing songs that voices never share
And no one dare
Disturb the sound of silence.

""Fools"" said I, ""You do not know
Silence like a cancer grows.
Hear my words that I might teach you,
Take my arms that I might reach you.""
But my words like silent raindrops fell,
And echoed
In the wells of silence

And the people bowed and prayed
To the neon god they made.
And the sign flashed out its warning,
In the words that it was forming.
And the sign said, ""The words of the prophets

Are written on the subway walls
And tenement halls.""
And whisper'd in the sounds of silence.",The Sound of Silence,1998

This way she moves in the logic of all my dreams

But it's something that I noticed

And I, I, I know why you're silent
It keeps you from crying

It shouldn't be so hard, the rest is simple
And we've already come this far

You still say that love is nothing like it should be
It isn't like the movies where everything goes right
In the ending, but you are something like a flower
Unfolding before me, underneath the morning light

And I, I can't give up on you even if I never win
'Cause this could be a feeling we'll never find again
Never find again, never find again, again, again, love

I, I see it in your eyes, you're not at all surprised
By the way I try to change your mind
Oh, but you, you've seen it all before
You don't believe it anymore
And you say that there's no guarantees
We will get it right this time

It always gets so hard, it's not so simple
You've had so many broken hearts

So you say that love is nothing like it should be
It isn't like the movies where everything goes right

Hurting than being alone If only I could've believed that time
Wouldn't take you from me Then I would have never let you leave
And now it's haunting me

I remember staying up late 'til our parents went to sleep Sneaking
Out the back door Meeting by the trees Taking our clothes off
Jumping in the creek That's when life was good

I remember holding up the phone line talking 'bout nothing
Drifting off to dream Waking up knowing we were young and still
In love And that's when life was good

I'm realizing over the years that catching and counting my tears
And if I'm patient they will disappear I'm ready to try it again The
Fire of when it begins The fight for a feeling that never ends It goes
On and on again

Out the back door Meeting by the trees Taking our clothes off
Jumping in the creek That's when life was good

Drifting off to dream Waking up knowing we were young and still

It reminds me of the winter fires we would always build
Hiding from the cold is always warmer in your arms

Who lived in my house and looked a lot like my mother
There was this kid I knew back then and I was sure he would be
The greatest star I'd ever known
I'd watch him walk into a room and he was never out of place
He knew the answer to every question
The square and cube of every prime
A name to go with every face
Like he was king upon a throne

By how Daivd always got the answers right

Now later on, I knew this guy,
He was in high school I think
Had lots of friends and was the pride of the family
He'd call me names and punch my head and made me feel like a dink
And I would hide from him all day

But if I couldn't find a friend,
Which happened more than I'd have liked,
I'd go where he was and sulk around him
He'd say you dont know how to throw and just dont play your stupid songs
And then he'd toss the ball my way

We had nothing in common
Nothing in common
I thought he was a jerk and who know what he thought I'd be
But twenty some years later I'm still grateful and surprised
By the little gifts that David gave to me

I knew this guy before I wed
He had a vision in his head
Of how his life would play out and his dreams would come true
But he was stumbling, he was stalled
And every year after he called
I'd just think man, there goes the lonliest guy I ever knew

But temporary set backs
Are part of what I planned

And one thing on his mind, and that’s the fire

He only knows he’s got to run
Toward the brightest promise in his eye
Now he’s circling to the ground
His wings have burned, he’s falling down

It was a world I never made
I just fell into this old parade
They told me it’s my time to shine
And they got ways to light me up at night

They didn’t care from where I came
It seemed they lost their pride and shame
Looking for a fire of their own

The wood’s all burned, it's ashes now

And then I do believe I’ve had enough”

Jason Segel,"Living on a lighted stage
Approaches the unreal
For those who think and feel
In touch with some reality
Beyond the gilded cage

Cast in this unlikely role,
Ill-equipped to act
With insufficient tact
One must put up barriers
To keep oneself intact

Living in the limelight
The universal dream
For those who wish to seem

Those who wish to be
Must put aside the alienation
Get on with the fascination
The real relation
The underlying theme

Living in a fish eye lens
Caught in the camera eye
I have no heart to lie
I can't pretend a stranger
Is a long-awaited friend

All the world's indeed a stage
And we are merely players
Performers and portrayer
Each another's audience
Outside the gilded cage",Limelight,2009

Where we used to raise a glass or two
Remember how we laughed away the hours
And dreamed of all the great things we would do

Those were the days my friend

We'd sing and dance forever and a day
We'd live the life we choose
We'd fight and never lose

Was that lonely woman really me

That town will always be you
In every crowd, on every corner,
Every face I'd see you

So with nothing more than a tank of gas
I drove away without looking back
And I guess that's how I got where I am
Going anywhere as fast as I can

Now I'm a little past Little Rock
Further down the line
Too soon to know what's up ahead
Too late to change my mind

I've got to keep my heart out of this
And both hands on the wheel
I'm learning more with every mile
Just how leaving feels

It's a lonely stretch of blacktop
Out into the blue
Don't know where I'll go
Or what I'll do

I'm a little past Little Rock,
But a long way from over you
These headlights on the highway
Disappear into the dark

And if I could have it my way
I'd go back to where you are
Oh, but I can't turn this thing around
And nothing short of breaking down

Is gonna get me off this road I'm on
But I'm still a far cry from gone
But I'm a little past Little Rock
Further down the line

Too soon to know what's up ahead
Too late to change my mind
I've got to keep my heart out of this
And both hands on the wheel

I'm learning more with every mile
Just how leaving feels
It's a lonely stretch of blacktop

Jason Shofield King,"I thought it was strange when all this shot into my mind driving. 
It's weird how this enclosed space makes me think so clearly...so free! 
I wish 
all hours were so relaxing. 
Thinking of the next noise... making up the 
next noise. Scream loud, loud, loud, loud. Static intoxication, sing 
this lovely violin song. Beat this bottle on a wall. Scream, scream, 
scream. The baby cries. Record the noise. It all makes sense...we're 
capable of beauty. Through sounds which make one cringe. The dogs only 
hear us now. For the first time tears came to my eyes while I was 
listening. Noise brings so many things...make my tingling skin freeze. 
Turn me on, make me laugh, shoot the can, shut the door, pour your glass, 
rape scene scream, car crash bash, black cat splat. 
A silent death, a silent scream...You can't follow me, you sing along to 
nothing.",Ad A Dglgmut,2011
Jason Shofield King,"Decrease the light, increase the smiles...a familiar heat is swarming the 
air. Soothing movements that help the evening come to a halt. Lifetime 
achievement... the looks on their faces make it worthwhile. The swaying 
of the ocean, to the swaying of your hips...shivering as your lover's 
caress touches your lips. Perfect world and perfect lives, we have the 
soundtrack for their futures. The seawater smell in the cold outside 
world seems to be enchanting the room. The chatter of riches keeping the 
beat, as the sea seems to freeze. The brisk air seems to make our hearts 
colder. The dimming smiles seem to have halted with a silent scream. We 
must play on. The perfect life torn apart in a matter of seconds...I hear 
their streams and cries...I know now that I'm the only one who possesses 
true happiness. We must play on. The perfect life torn apart in a matter 
of seconds...I hear their screams and cries...I know now that I'm the only 
one who possesses true happiness. We must play on. Keep the beat, we tap 
our feet...screams add a new feel to what we've perfected so dear. We'll 
play to our deaths for we possess true happiness. We are finally free. 
Dying with our one passion, music: the greatest wealth of them all. We 
must play on.",Aesthetic,2011
Jason Shofield King,"[Day one] Asleep mid-sentence- the words fell apart. No one is listening 
anyway. This day will soon turn black and my ""wants and needs"" will spill 
on my burning ashes. I learned to be selfish today...I learned to be 
alive. These things I care for are for my personal gain and my person 
happiness only. Why should I sit in your chairs and satisfy your 
standards. I've done it all before and I've confused myself a thousand 
times. The tragic day that I call morality just doesn't do it for me 
anymore. No more choices, just standing in the cold. The day will turn 
black and I will have either lived or died. Asleep mid-sentence- my words 
fall to the ground. Swept into this dreamland. Economic satisfaction, 
never succeed. But happiness has its place. Justice will not lie in your 
corner. New day towards death, only compassion for my own needs make my 
need necessary.
[Day two] Throw myself in the corner; I have nothing to complain about
here. A tragic day seems too peaceful to most, spoiled ambitious turned 
my heart to black. I'm figuring out this realization process- the process 
to never look upon bitter ground. Living dreams, loving dreams, awakening 
to what I've always dreamt of. The familiar sound of lovely love from the 
love of my life will keep the notes coming. From the reciting of the 
show, from the plip and the shevanel, from the grind that annoys, and the
season they hate...forever I worship. I'll kill, love, and hate for all of you.

And you can tell me if you think I'm getting better on the drums.
I'll leave the front un-locked 'cause I can't
Hear the doorbell

When I get into it I can't tell if you are
Watching me twirling the stick.
When I give the signal, my friend
Rabbi Vole will pay the solo

Some day somebody else besides me will
Call me by my stage name, they will
Call me Dr Worm.
Good Morning how are you, I'm Dr Worm
I'm interested in things.
I'm not a real doctor,
But I am a real worm;
I am an actual worm.
I live like a worm.

I like to play the drums.

Bring your flowered hat

It's true
For last night, I made love for the very 
First time
With you

I'm telling you made the difference

Last night, you bought something special
Out of me
And for the first time
You made my dream a reality

I never though love was meant for me
For I was blind and could not see
You bought about a love that's so sincere
And I'm telling you, you've made the 
Difference
Now love is so sincere

I'm with my son cashing a check, so I asked out of respect, uh
Would she like to explore the world or fly, we can fly in my jet
Her reply was yes (Can I ask you something?)
I seen it in her eye, momma looking like all I wanted was sex
Then moved to the next (That ain't true)
But it was something about his girls style that make me feel no regrets
We started off casual walks through the park
Candle light dinners by dark, I'm thinking smart
Afraid she might think I'm in a rush to touch, clutch and be up
But baby I ain't on that stuff
Dropped her off and told her call me up
We could talk, conversate about political subjects, whatever starts
So I zoomed off thinkin' bout her, my phone rang
It was her in the shower (what did she say?)
She said I couldn't do without you Then I say

Here she come with her friends they posted up on the wall
Now I'm showin' off, tryin' to dunk, tryin' to dribble
Break fast threw the middle just to see her smile and giggle
Game over I approached her with a kiss on the cheek
The homeboys looking at me saying Lil Howard you weak
But you know how that go, what I got they want
What I got I flaunt, never mess with it please don't
Told her I'm goin home she asked can she go too
I'm like yeah boo, I can't see me without you

With a see-threw thong on looked at her and I said

Oh you don't smoke? Grab a pint of henn and we can get drunk
Its up to you, I'm the man but baby just let me know
'Cause if you got a attitude then I could treat you just like a ho
If ya rollin with me baby hop in its enough room
We can gaze at the stars and shine like the moon
Give me a chance to show ya and a chance to know ya

To let them know below that you believe.

There ain't no use to fight.
We'll trade faces with the shadows 
And change voices with the night.

And the sky drips down, ain't nothing is a sin.
So we'll taste the ground while we dance around
Underneath each other's skin.
When the raven calls your name 
And the barn owl starts her flight,
We'll trade faces with the shadows 
And change voices with the night.

When you hear those spirits calling, 
There ain't no wrong or right.
We'll trade faces with the shadows

Jason Webley,"On an empty bus at midnight at the border between two worlds,
Neither of which knows my name.
Mosquitos and the driver's snores weave a lullaby around my wrists,
That feels like handcuffs.
After hours of motion, watching the world spin by
Through a one and a half foot by one and a half foot portal,
I am in complete stillness.
And I feel that I am suffering from lack-of-motion sickness.

I close my eyes and the world spins by,
Taking me to the edge of my mind.
I open my eyes and the sky unfolds.
There's no more mystery about eternity.",La Mesilla,1998
Jason Webley,"I want music that tears itself apart 
And takes the lot of you with it.
I need a catchy tune like a bullet in the heart.
So come on old and young, 
Sing while your teeth grind through your tongues,
We're making music that tears itself apart.

I want sobs that shake my spine like an earthquake.
I want to laugh like cities crashing down.
While a thousand slender dames 
Keep chanting out my name,
So loud the gods will never forget my sound.

I'll practice breathing fire in missile silos.
All the ambassadors admire me for my tact.
I've sailed all seven seas 
And every port's made of ricotta cheese,
And it's time we start acknowledging the fact.

I'll roll the earth into a cigar and smoke it, 
Just after I've made love with the sky.
I'll have a little chat with time before I choke it,
And teach all the art worms how to fly.

I've got an army of lunatics armed with CB radios patrolling the subways, 
And a warehouse full of underpaid workers transcribing everything they say.

And publish the Great American Novel someday.",Music That Tears Itself Apart,1998
Jason Webley,"Wake up in a room where steel guitars,
Turn to steel bars,.
You know I've lived here to long.
Try to write these songs about being bored,
Why am I so surprised when they all prove boring songs?

The second hand holds still while the hour hand slips by.
I don't know just how long I've been here.
I'll just stare out the window and contemplate the sky,
While I grow older than my years.

Plucking strings at the site of my bed,
By a stack of books most of which I've never read.
I want to capture in sound the way things are,
But I'd regret it in the morning if I smashed my guitar.

Well they're never going to tell us just what's coming around the bend,
But there's one thing I can count on,
That's that old man time is not my fucking friend.

Jason Webley,"The weeks slip through our fingers like the dry sand blowing across the dunes,
Swept into a cardboard box filled with forgotten photographs
And abandoned songs.
The past few years are illuminated only by the dim glow
Of a sun setting in the east

It's almost night.
I scour the landscape trying to make out your familiar shape against the horizon.
But it's amazing how rarely our paths cross considering we share the same bed.
The sand stings my face and I keep walking, keep looking.
And I can barely make out the sound of my own voice beneath the wind:
Maybe we'll be alone.",Prelude,1998
Jason Webley,"The darkness will be here in an hour,
To leave me completely alone with my fears, insecurities,
And the ghost of a face that walked into a crowd,
And out of this chapter of my life.
You've come a long way, you've got a long way to go.
Ain't nothing steady about the rhythm of the road.

And in fifteen seconds, the years flash by and I'm gone..
Brand new highway, the world on my back,
And nowhere to go but on.
Tilt back my head, listen to the motor moan.
Look back, look ahead, baby we'vebeen alone.

And baby we'll be alone.
But that's alright, I'll hold you tight
Through the long arms of the night.
And maybe in the morning, I'll call you on the phone.

On the edge, I'm gonna jump.
See I've got to, the ticket's bought and I've already checked my bag.
But we've got half an hour, let's sit and have a drink.
Talk a bit, a little kiss, then it's into the abyss.
I've fallen before, I've got a few falls to go.
Once you start falling, you know you never really know.

You can overthrow the world, pass the day upon its thrown,
But you wake up in the morning, thinking maybe you've been alone.
And maybe you'll be alone.

Jason Webley,"Old Jack he had a sack of them magic beans, 
This garden's been sown for a long, long time. 
Now everywhere you look, you see a pillar of green, 
And the reaper's just waiting 'til we're ripe on the vine. 

A bright red apple led us into sin, 
The Devil's been cooking for a long, long time. 
So it could be an eggplant to lead us back again, 
That sounds just fine. 

We're going back to the garden, and out of the night, 
I saw a fiery head of broccoli in a dream. 
There'll be artichokes and rutabagas, 
Collard greens and sweet potatoes, 
Reaching from the earth to push us into the light. 

Gonna carve a jack-o-lantern, hang the garlic high, 
This crop's been coming for a long, long time. 
Flaming red peppers will rain down from the sky, 
And your tap water'll turn into okra slime. 

There'll come a day you step out of the house, 
And see a thousand armed soldiers with potatoes in their mouth. 
Everyone's damned, and everyone's saved, 
With a parsley garnish on every grave. 

My friends, we are standing at the dawn of a new era. The United League of Vegetation, has just unanimously approved the new legislation, which places complete restriction on all forms of human migration. 
Anyone caught moving faster than a turnip will be shot. 
Now, I know what you're all thinking: What am I going to do with myself? I've got to go pick up the kids. There's a turkey in the oven. Relax. Don't panic. This isn't so bad. You've just got to calm down. 
Now, close your eyes and imagine a bright, red, pulsing orb just in front of your forehead. Can you see it? Good. Can you feel it? I said, can you feel it? 
Can you feel the beet? 

Oh, forget about your taxes and your student loans, 
This garden's pesticide free, organically grown. 
Listen to your roots, they'll tell you what's real.

Of cabbage cauliflower and kale.

Yeah, the breathing has stopped, 
But the hair keeps on growing, 
The anchor's been dropped, 
But the crew keeps on rowing, 
Captain, where are we going now? 

Just the echo remains, 
Of the refrain of a drunken song. 
That I spent all my days, 
Training monkeys to sing along. 

Now there's some kind of answer, 
Being demanded of us. 
But tonight is infected, 
I guess we should squeeze out the pus. 

Yeah there's dust on the rules, 
Of this game we're trying to play. 
So I can't tell if I'm getting closer,

A hair to fast to catch the rapture of the dragonfly, 
Now those two cars, are parked outside bars tonight. 

You've got a Turkish umbrella over your head, 
A fading lover in your bed, 
And a fleeting immortality balanced on the tip of your toe.

Jason Webley,"The flowers by your bed are wilting. 
The sun is setting in the west. 
A fog is covering your eyes, 
Your stockings are attracting flies, 
Decay is nibbling at the boards on which you rest. 

There's someone waiting at your window, 
Familiar face without a name. 
One night he'll creep in like the mist, 
To touch your forehead with a kiss, 
And lead you back into the void from whence you came. 

We've all begun to die, and don't know what to do. 
Since it hurts to pray to God, when God is dying too. 
Takes strength to laugh, when you start to drown. 
And we dance while the sky crashes down. 

Like that the earth begins to quiver, 
And all the oceans turn to black. 
A ship of maniacs with knives, 
Are playing Blackjack with their lives, 
To kill the time until the giant rats attack. 

It's raining leprosy and acid. 
The saints were taken out and shot. 
When someone proffers you a pear,

All that we weave, will find its way back to the dust. 

A band of skeletons is playing, 
Don't act like you don't know the tune. 
Your part is echoed in the path, 
Of every dead leaf blowing past, 
Against a counterpoint reflected off the moon. 

There is a banquet at the table, 
Exotic cheeses wines and cakes. 
And every one of us is damned,

Jason Webley,"Hey kid, I've been watching you. 
Sleeping in the lilies with that old dull-bladed knife. 
Still in those bulletproof pyjamas you've worn all your life. 
But tonight you're in some murky bar, 
The music's too loud, and you don't feel like dancing. 
Not a familiar face in the room, 
Just that little voice in the back of your head, 
That's always been there, but tonight it says: 
The days are getting shorter, the air is getting colder, 
And as you sip your rum and coke, kid, 
You're just getting older. 
You realize you're sweating, and the air around you stinks, 
You stumble to the bathroom, 
Throw your head beneath the sink. 
And as you raise your eyes, your lips release a little groan, 
'Cause the face that's grinning back at you, 
Just isn't quite your own. 

So you go back to your lily petals, 
Pull those old pyjamas tight, 
But you can't shake this feeling 
That your life is just a game of chess 
Where ancient gods and devils fight. 
People stagger by you, 
Thick blood running down their faces, 
While little jet-black serpents 
Try to mate with your shoelaces.
An old blind dog's been at your heels, 
With the overpowering stench of decay. 
And an old friend sends a package. 
The skull inside it seems to say: 
I'm the face in every mirror, the shadow at your feet, 
The little light that glows behind 
Each pair of eyes that you meet. 
You can hide inside your castle, 
Spend years thinking you're free, 
But I'm like ancient Rome, baby, all roads lead to me.

Okay kid, let me tell you a little story. See, I don't get into town too often these days, but sometime soon old Jack Frost's gonna blow back into the heart of the big city. 
And I'll scream until the buildings melt, 
Then whisper 'til they freeze. 
And I'll stand on an icy tower with every eye fixed on me.

Of this world and stare into the void that lies behind.",Winter,1999

The picture frame's cracked,
The photos have all faded to gray.
The faces you trusted,
Just never came back,
Yes childhood has eroded away.
And the songs that your mother sang,
As she rocked you to sleep,
You howl out of tune when you're drunk.
Wear good shoes on these streets,
Or you'll soon cut your feet,
On a piece of the broken cup.

After so many Johns and Janes,
Have stained your sheets,
Is it habit or thirst brings them back?
After so many pipers,
Have played on these streets,
Who is missed more, the children or the rats?
Yes we've traded our toy choo-choo trains,
And rosary beads,
For a bottle of gin and a fuck.
Now we sit 'round the bar,
Proud of how bored we are,
As we drink from our broken cup.

We sing, ""everything, everything, everything,
Is now permitted.
All the oaths we've taken,
Have been graciously forgotten,
And every sin, every sin,
Is now forgiven.""
And every sip somehow tastes rotten.

So let's drink to the men,
Who forgot what they lost.
They've got the best shoes that money can buy.
And a toast to our impotence,
Our cowardice, our sloth,
Nothing matters, why bother to try?
And three cheers for Mary,
Our virgin, our whore.
If she favors you, it's just dumb luck.

To a life on our ass.

While your waiting to die,

A faint echo of grace,
Through the crack in our broken cup.",Broken Cup,2002

Singing goodbye forever once again.

You and I made love between the train tracks and the graveyard.
For just a couple hours you were mine.
Now I watch the sky, it helps e forget your face,
So I can touch your lips again for the first time.

I keep all the embraces that once kept me warm,
In a scrapbook I flip through sometimes.
I get drunk on nostalgia,
I tell myself this life's been good.
But so many pages are wrinkled and worn,
The faces are fading away,
Just snapshots of graceful decay.
And I can't tell if I'm holding o to
The things I should.

The bent trunk of a tree,
White flowers in the meadow,

And bright,

She's strange, she is so familiar.
You just look at her back,
And your hair stands on its ends.
And maybe she leads you to a garden and invites
You to release your lips and bite
Through all that you've been told.

You drink from a cup that is broken.
And its lonely in this crowd,
Guess you'll just go home to bed.
And maybe your caught beneath a softly shifting sky

Asleep at your side.
Gone, the embrace of a lover,

As your hand goes to touch her again.
She's a temple that won't let you in.
At her side you're alone.
On her back is the same constellation,
Confirming your alienation.
No this flesh is not home.

You, carry a vague conviction,
This life rose from an eviction,
Out of your homeland.
True, but it's also addiction,
To this soft crucifixion,
Under these foreign hands.
And like all Christs before you,
You kneel down beneath the night sky,
To look into your father's eyes,
And only feel lost.

And we parked way out in a clearin' in a grove 
And the night was as hot as a coal burnin' stove
And we were cookin' the gas
Knew it had to last

In the back of that red ragtop
She said please don't stop

Well the very first time her mother met me
Her green-eyed girl had been a mother to be for two weeks
I was out of a job and she was in school
Life was fast and the world was cruel
And we were young and wild, 
We decided not to have the child
So we did what we did and we tried to forget
And we swore up and down there would be no regrets

And on the way home that night

You don't think life comes in between
But hey, she's just seventeen
She feels that she's a worldly girl

But man you've been around the world
She is just some worried daddy's girl
Even though there's nothing I can say
To cheat you and nature any way

Let her down easy
Her heart is on a dime
Let her down easy
And you'll grow up in time

In her strawberry eyes
The way she sees you signifies
That she's susceptible to your velvet lies
But if you must lay her down

May a butterscotch glow be her dressing gown
And please do not lead her on when you leave town
Even though there's nothing I can say
To cheat you and nature any way

Let her down easy
Her heart is on the line
Let her down easy
And you'll grow up in time

She's a woman now
With a daughter to make her proud
In her crayon world of paper clouds
She still remembers you

The first boy that she gave it to
And she laughs at how little then she knew
Her daughter's five and
Her grandfather adores her of course

Let her down easy
Her heart is on the line
Let her down easy
And you'll grow up in time

A song in blue
Like a flower crying
For the dew

From my tender sentimental woes
That was my heart trying to compose
A prelude to a kiss

With nothing fancy

A Shubert tune with a Gershwin touch

For the tenderness within your eyes

Jaise meri saari duniya main geeton ki rut
Aur rangon ki barkha hai khushbu ki aandhi hai
Mehki hui si ab saari fizaayen hain
Behki hui si ab saari hawaayen hain
Khoyi hui si ab saari dishaayen hain
Badli hui se ab saari adaayen hain
Jaagi ummengein hain, dhadak raha ahi dil
Sanson main toofaan hain, hoton pe nagme hain
Aakhon main sapne hain, sapnon main beete hue
Saare vo lamhe hain
Jab koi aaya tha, nazron pe chhaya tha
Dil main samaya tha, kaise main bataun tumhe
Kaise use paaya tha, pyaar ke chehre pe bikhri jo julphen
To aisa lagta tha jaise kohre ke peechhe
Ek os main dhula hua phool khila hai jaise
Badal main ik chaand chhupa hai
Aur jhaank raha hai jaise raat ke parde main
Ek savera hai roshan roshan aakhon main
Sapnon ka saagar jismain prem sitaron ki chaadar
Jaise jhalak rahi hai
Lahron lahron baat kare to jaise moti barse
Jaise kahin chandi ki payal goonjey
Jaise kahin sheeshe ke jaam girey
Aur chhann se tootey jaise koi chhip ke sitaar bajaye
Jaise koi chaandni raat main gaye
Jaise koi hole se paas bulaye
Kaisi meethi baatain thee vo
Kaisi mulakaatein thee vo
Jab maine jaana tha
Nazron se kaise pighalte hain dil
Aur aarzoo paati hai kaise manzil
Aur kaise utarta hai chaand jameen par
Kaise kabhi lagta hai swarg agar hai
To bas hai yahin par
Usne bulaya mujhe, aur samjhaya mujhe
Hum jo mile hain, hamain aise hi milna tha
Gul jo khile hain, unhe aise hi khilna tha
Janmo ke bandhan, janmo ke rishtey hain
Jab bhi hum janme to hum yuhin milte hain
Kaanon main mere jaise, shahed sa ghulne lage
Khwaabon ke dar jaise aakhon main khulne lage
Khwaabon ki duniya bhi kitni haseen aur
Kaisi rangeen thee khwaabon ki duniya
Jo kahne ko thee par kahin bhi nahi thee
Khwaab jo toote mere, aakh jo khuli meri
Hosh jo aaya mujhe
Maine dekha maine jaana
Vo jo kabhi aaya tha, nazron pe chhaya tha
Dil main samaya tha, ja bhi chuka hai
Aur dil mera hai ab tanha tanha
Na to koi armaan hai, na koi tamanna hai
Aur na koi sapna hai
Ab jo mere din aur ab jo meri ratain hain
Unmain sirf aansoon hain
Unmain seif dard ki ranj ki batain hain
Aur pharyaadein hain
Mera ab bhi koi nahi main hoon aur khoye
Hue pyaar ki yaadein hain",Breathless [Hindi Pop],2003

I try to reach for you.  but you have closed my mind

It used to be so nice.  It used to be so good
 
So when you're near me, darling, can't you hear me S.O.S.?
The love you gave me. nothing else can save me, S.O.S.
When you're gone, how can I even try to go on?
When you're gone though I try how can I carry on?

You made me feel alive but something died I fear

Javi,"Un 5 de Julio del año 1986
Llego al mundo Bull and Raice
En un pueblo de la costa norte de la isla Corl Carolina
El chamaquito conoció el lado oscuro de la isla
Viendo como los panas se mataban en el cacerio por kilo o por libra
A veces solo por poder o por guía
Y una noche sintió una música en el huesos
Y en su sistema sanguíneo
Y el chamaquito entonces tubo esta misión
Vivir de la música brother no es imposible
Cuando de la música es que deseas vivir

Any solo dream ya vivo en el siglo 25
Mami sin dinero, papi no es precinto
Y yo me acuerdo en las noches me pasaba pensando
Algún día seré rico o moriré tratando

Pero ahora todo es diferente
Ahora le gusto a la gente
El que estaba pichando
(Lo digo mamando)
Su carrera esta en peligro
(Lo digo mamando)

Ahora no hay break
Seguiré matando hasta que yo lo decida
Mataré a to el que siga envidiando

Ahora no hay break
Me importa to correr lo que la gente diga
No me voy a quitar (Mientras siga respirando)

Tienen que aceptar la realidad
Que acabo de arrancar y no voy a parar
Y aunque hay un centenar que me quieran ver mal
Yo no voy a parar, no

Y hay que aceptar la realidad
Que acabo de arrancar y no voy a parar
Y aunque hay un centenar que me quieran ver mal
Yo no voy a parar, no

Ahora no hay break
Seguiré matando hasta que yo lo decida
Mataré a to el que siga envidiando

Ahora no hay break
Me importa to correr lo que la gente diga
No me voy a quitar (Mientras siga respirando)

Un 3 de Octubre de 1980 llego al mundo en el seno de una familia humilde
El chamaquito fue criado por una madre soltera
El chamaquito jamas permitió que eso se convirtiera en una dificultad papi
El chamaquito agarro lo mejor que pudo de la experiencia
Y con la música como norte
El chamaquito comprendió si misión en la vida
Que la vida a veces esta llena de depresiones tropicales
Y que never stop five and the level
Y dios no the raith papi
Ahhh

Jaja
Cuando empece en esta cuestión fue sin mirar atrás
Sin saber que el camino es duro pero hay que luchar
Con un entendimiento y mientras canto pasa el tiempo
Veo como mi carrera gira, oh que bien me siento
Ahora se, que lo que cultive ha rendido frutos
En absoluto no fue en vano como lo disfruto
Y solo es el comienzo (Colega me escuchas)
'Toy viajando el mundo entero, intenciones tengo muchas
Muchas puertas que toque, mil estudios visite
Sentía que me quitaba, pero nunca me quite
Y aquí estamos, dos seres humanos que se juntan
Dejando de que hablar, hay muchas preguntas
Gracias al señor por la fuerza que me diste
La madre que me pusiste, la familia y lo que hiciste
Contesto sus preguntas con la dura realidad

Kind of like a summer's breeze, 
You do exactly as you please, 
Drop a brother to his knees just for fun.
I think it was the first of May, 
Girl I can't forget the day, 
Right then and there I knew you were the one. 
Do you think that possibly, 
You could spend your life with me, 
Cause girl this love is growing, and it's hotter than the sun.

I get a little bit crazy baby, 
Every time you call my name 
My heart beats a little bit faster, 
After, you are in my arms again. 
You try to fight it, 
Don't even try to hide it, 
Emotions falling down like the rain, 
I can't find the words to explain it, 
Ain't it, crazy how I fall, 
Every time you call my name.

It's kind of like a work of art, 
You shot an arrow through my heart, 
Even though we're worlds apart I can't deny, 
It feels like your apart 
Of me the finish and the start of me, 
Girl you are the heart of me, 
And that's no lie, 
Did I mention that I love you so, 
And I just want the world to know, 
If I could you know I would write your name across the sky.

Crazy, crazy
Every time that your close to me, 
I lose control of my sanity, 
Every night, everyday, every word and you say, 
Girl do you know you put a spell on me.

Crazy, 
Every time you call my name, 
I don't know what to do,
I'm so in love with you.",Crazy,
Javier,"What happened to the way we were
We be fighting and yelling things
And we can't seem to get it back together
Pride gets the best of me

I said, Oh, I ain't even called you in days
And oh, I miss you but I'm playing the game
I need to check myself before I throw it away
Stand up and be a real man?

Girl, I know, I got a good thing
And I know, that you're my everything
So you'll always be all I need
Girl, nothing means more to me

I can try to find someone that's more special
But I'd search all my life for someone 'cause they're no one like my angel
And God knows that I'd be a fool if I ever let you go
That would be the biggest mistake of my life

Sometimes I go and pick a fight
That's how I get out at night
How could I think that our love would last forever
When we don't even spend any time together?

I finally understand the pain
And I knew, I'd never ever do it again
'cause I've come to learn how perfect you are
Now I'm gonna be a real man

Girl, I know, I got a good thing
And I know, that you're my everything
So you'll always be all I need

I can try to find someone that's more special
But I'd search all my life for someone 'cause they're no one like my angel
And God knows that I'd be a fool if I ever let you go
That would be the biggest mistake of my life

I finally realized, that my heart can't take the thought of losing you
You can see it in my eyes, there's that, to be without you
Would be the biggest mistake of my life, of my life

I can try to find someone that's more special
But I'd search all my life for someone 'cause they're no one like my angel
And God knows that I'd be a fool if I ever let you go

You're the wind that carries me away

I had an angel here on earth
That I could call my very own

I found my piece of heaven
The day that I found you

Longer than poets will rhyme

Until the end of time
If I should die before tomorrow comes
I won't regret a single day

Was to lose myself in you

In your hands, I place my trembling heart
All of my dreams lead me to you
Now the tears of yesterday is gone
I've let go of holding on
There's a place where all my journeys end
Where my broken soul can mend
Here I stand, there's nothing in my way

And your words, once so sweet, now they fall incomplete
And they're no longer speaking to me
When will I shed my grief for a moments relief
And pretend these aren't tears in my eyes
I'm as blue as the October sky

Now I feel like such a fool
'Cause my love's been over-ruled
So I have to plead my case to the moon
What more can I do?
When your touch has gone cold, like the first hint of snow
And your emotions seem frozen inside
They're as cold as the October sky

Now I feel like such a fool
'Cause my love's been over-ruled
So I have to plead my case to the moon

How could I make her see, she's the only one for me
And she's driving me crazy

[Chorus]
It's the way that she spoke to me
Cut right through to the soul of me
She got closer than close to me
Took control of me totally

It's got to be the way that she looked at me
And my heart that she took from me
Don't you know that it felt like destiny
When she spoke to me

Her eyes were calling me to come closer
She said so much without even saying a word
And even though I don't really know her
It was the sweetest offer I'd ever heard

And she put her hand in mine
And we danced through the night
Underneath the starry skies
And we lost track of time, as I left the world behind
When she looked into my eyes

[Chorus]

It's got to be the way that she looked at me
And my heart that she took from me
Don't you know that it felt like destiny
When she spoke to me

Can't stop thinking 'bout
The way she makes me crazy
And everytime we touch it's such a feeling
That I can't fight, can't hide what's deep inside

I won't stop it's too hot I can't take it
Can't lie, there's no way that I can fake it
No use but to surrender to her love

So we talked for a while
And I couldn't help but smile she's so amazing
How could I make her see, she's the only one for me
And she's driving me crazy

[Chorus]

It's got to be the way that she looked at me
And my heart that she took from me
Don't you know that it felt like destiny
When she spoke to me

[Chorus]

It's got to be the way that she looked at me
And my heart that she took from me
Don't you know that it felt like destiny
When she spoke to me

[Chorus]

It's got to be the way that she looked at me
And my heart that she took from me
Don't you know that it felt like destiny
When she spoke to me",She Spoke to Me,2003
Javier,"She was from the other side of town
A place where skin like mine just ain't around
A place of unwritten laws and ancient ways
Where no one dares to stray

But as our destiny's were laughing
Some how we came to be close friends
And now I'm haunted by this crazy secret
That's got me crying till the end

How much I wanted, how I needed to let my feelings show
How much my heart overflowed, she'll never know
How much I loved her, I couldn't hurt her so I had to let her go
How much it tortures my soul, she'll never know

Every time she looked into my eyes
I knew that all she wanted was a sign
Oh, but that was the one thing I couldn't do
'Cause of all the hell they'd put her through

They would cast her aside forever
And I could never watch her be disowned
There's just no way I won't put her through it
And that's why she'll never know

How much I wanted, how I needed to let my feelings show
How much my heart overflowed, she'll never know
How much I loved her, I couldn't hurt her so I had to let her go
How much it tortures my soul, she'll never know

It hurt so bad to be denied without a reason there is no reason
It was too much to keep inside all I could say was goodbye

How much I wanted, how I needed to let my feelings show
How much my heart overflowed, she'll never know
How much I loved her, I couldn't hurt her so I had to let her go
How much it tortures my soul, she'll never know

How much I wanted, how I needed to let my feelings show
How much my heart overflowed, she'll never know

Javier,"Do do do do do dodo do do do do dodo 
Ooooooohhh oooohhh oooooohhhhhh

Goin in, I knew what I was gettin into
Never thought I'd be so predictable, so weak
Somethin' bout the way she looked at me
It was the day, she was lookin out the window as she drove by
Lip gloss smile and brown eyes
Everything thing stopped (pause)
(She was so hot)

(The angle of her chin 
The color of her skin)

When she saw me stare
She acted like she didn't care
(I didn't say a word, butmy intensions were)
To touch her and kiss her
I never thought forever

Have you ever known a girl
Who could make your world go in slow motion
Kinda like a movie, that's the way she do me
Have you ever met somebody who could stop the hands of time and make you wait
Make you love in slow motion

Ordinarily, I woulda bounced by day three
On to the next girl, scroll to delete on my cell phone screen
But a voice kept callin me
It was the way, she would whisper in my ear that I was her man
The slightest little touch of her hand
Everything stops 
She's got me high

(The angle of her chin 
The color of her skin)

And when she saw me stare
She acted like she didn't care
I didn't say a word, but my intensions were
To touch her, and kiss her

Have you ever known a girl
Who could make your world go in slow motion
Kinda like a movie, that's the way she do me
Have you ever met somebody who could stop the hands of time and make you wait
Make you love in slow motion

She is truly something
I can't belive that I'm love and
She feels the same way (same way)
She is so amazing
My heart ain't never breaking
Cuz she's my baby

I could go on for days (yea yea, yea yea)
Talkin bout her sexy ways ( yea yea, yea yea)
Kinda girl that makes me weak (yea yea, yea yea)
Can't believe she wants to be with me

Have you ever known a girl
Who could make your world go in slow motion
Kinda like a movie, that's the way she do me
Have you ever met somebody who could stop the hands of time and make you wait

Javier,"How am I supposed to let go of this feeling?
How am I supposed to erase this image of your sweet face?
When it seems like just yesterday,
We made a promise of love that I'm about to break
How do I walk away after all these years?
And all I can give you... is a song for your tears

Now we both know the light of our love has been fading
When I come home, tell you bout my day...
You don't hear a word that I say
We carry on like nothing's wrong
We can change up the words, but it's the same old song
Now I've gotta say what we don't wanna hear
And all I have left is a song for your tears

We can try to disguise what we're both feeling inside
We learned how to love, we learned how to cry
Can we learn how to say goodbye?
Goodbye

So it's time... the cards are all out on the table
I've packed up my bags... I'm ready to go
But there's something I want you to know
Every day that we shared I will never regret
And the love that we made I will never forget

But all of those days have long disappeared
And all that remains is a song for your tears
All that remains is the heartache and pain!

I know I made a promise to ya baby
But I was wrong, so wrong
I'm so sorry baby, so sorry baby",Song for Your Tears,2003
