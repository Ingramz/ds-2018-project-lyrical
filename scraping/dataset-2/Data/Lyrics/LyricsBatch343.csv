Hank Williams III,"Lookin' back through the years, I saw my anger
There was things that I could not control
Wanderin' through my memories with my darlin'
Now I fall through the door on my own

On my own again
All alone again
Now I see what it's like when your away
On my own again
All a lone again
Now I see what its like I'm away

He was a man, walkin' big and proud
And he was walkin' through a mighty thick crowd
Although we never could understand where this man had been
For as time grew on, he grew weak and thin
As the days rolled on, through the nights
Well, he started drinkin' so much
He was loosin' his mind
And as he sits back, he knows that he'll die alone

On my own again
All alone again
Now I see what it's like when your away
On my own again
All a lone again
Now I see what its like I'm away

Now I see what its like I'm away",On My Own,1999
Hank Williams III,"Well there's some big black clouds 
That's a blowin' in from the west
I've been drivin' all day 
Lord, I sure could use some rest
And there's a motel up ahead where I can unwind
Cause I sure love thunderstorms and neon signs

I grew up on the road from town to town 
My daddy's line of work kept us movin' around
I got fond memories of the way things were back then
The warmth of a neon when a cold storm is movin' in

Listen to the opry in a small cafe
When we stop to get a bite along the way
Whenever I hear the wheels begin to whine
It takes me back to another time

I got a real nice room with a radio and TV
This here motel livin' is the only life for me
And it looks like it'll be rainin' for quite some time
Mixed with the lightning is the glow from a neon sign

Listen to the opry in a small cafe
When we stop to get a bite along the way
Whenever I hear the wheels begin to whine
It takes me back to another time
                          
Well there's some big black clouds 
That's a blowin' in from the west
I've been drivin' all day 
Lord, I sure could use some rest
And there's a motel up ahead where I can unwind
Cause I sure love thunderstorms and neon signs

Cause I sure love thunderstorms and neon signs",Thunderstorms and Neon Signs,1999
Hank Williams III,"Some day you'll find out what it means to be blue
'cause everybody pays for the things that they do 
You broke something precious, sacred and true 
Darlin', what did love ever do to you

I still can't believe what I'm feelin'
As my heart turns slowly to stone
I'm staring a hole through the ceiling 
The memory of your leaving won't let go 

Oh, some day you'll find out what it means to be blue
'cause everybody pays for the things that they do 
You broke something precious, sacred and true 
Darlin', what did love ever do to you

Your words built the walls of this prison 
And like a fool I'm doin' time for you 
I searched through my mind for a reason 
But when you left, you left me without a clue 

Some day you'll find out what it means to be blue
'cause everybody pays for the things that they do 
You broke something precious, sacred and true 
Darlin', what did love ever do to you

You broke something precious, sacred and true 
Darlin', what did love ever do to you",What Did Love Ever Do to You,1999
Hank Williams III,"Last night ya told me that I ain't worth a dime 
Well don't worry honey 'cause I'm leaving this time

Why don't ya leave me alone
Why don't ya leave me alone
Well, your hillbilly daddy's packin' 
And I'm gonna get gone

We never got along, I guess we never will
So I'm saying ""So long,"" it oughta give you a thrill

Why don't ya leave me alone
Why don't ya leave me alone
Well, your hillbilly daddy's packin' 
And I'm gonna get gone

Well I'm going joint-jumpin' down at Club 21
I ain't looking for trouble, I just wanna have fun

You want a sensitive sissy that'll hear your command
Not a hillbilly singer with a five-piece band

Why don't ya leave me alone
Why don't ya leave me alone
Well, your hillbilly daddy's packin'
And I'm gonna get gone

Last night ya told me that I ain't worth a dime 
Well don't worry honey 'cause I'm leaving this time

Hank Williams III,"I lay here at night
I toss and I turn
Lovin' you so
How my heart yearns

Honey, you're the reason I can't sleep at night

Just a-walkin' the floor 
Thinking of you 
Smoke cigarettes 
And Drink coffee too

Honey, you're the reason I can't sleep at night

I'm bettin' you're not losin' sleep over me
But if I'm wrong, don't fail to call
Come over and keep me company

Sometimes I go for a walk 
Look at the moon
Strum my guitar
Sing out an old tune

Honey, you're the reason I can't sleep at night

I'm bettin' you're not losin' sleep over me
But if I'm wrong, don't fail to call

Hank Williams III,"Well they blew up the chicken man 
In Philly last night
Now they blew up his house too

Down on the boardwalk they're gettin' 
Ready for a fight,
Gonna see what them racket boys can do

Now there's trouble busin' in 
From outta state,
And the D.A. can't get no relief

Gonna be a rumble 
Out on the promenade and the
Gamblin' commission's hangin' 
On by the skin of its teeth

[Chorus]
Well now everything dies, baby that's a fact,
But maybe everything that dies, someday comes back
Put your makeup on, fix your hair up pretty
And meet me tonight in Atlantic City

Well I got a job and tried to
Put my money away,
But I got debts that no honest man can pay

So I drew what I had,
From the Central Trust,
And bought us two tickets on that City Coast bus

[Chorus]

Now our luck may have died,
And our love may be cold,
But with you forever, I'll stay

Now I been lookin' for a job, 
But it's hard to find
Down here it's just winners and losers

Honey, last night, 
I met this guy, 
And I'm gonna do a favor for him.

Everything dies, baby that's a fact,
But maybe everything that dies
Someday, comes back

Put your hair up nice and sit up pretty, 
And meet me tonight in Atlantic City
Meet me tonight in Atlantic City
Meet me tonight in Atlantic City",Atlantic City,2000
Hank Williams III,"I could settle down
And be doin' just fine
Till I hear that old freight
Comin' down the line
Then I hurry straight
Home and pack and if I didn't go
I'd be 'bout lose my stack
I love you, baby, but you gotta understand
When the Lord made me, he made a ramblin' man

Some folks might say that I'm no good
That I wouldn't settle down if I could
But when that open road starts callin' me
There's somethin' o'er the hill that I got to see
Sometimes it's hard, but you gotta understand
When the lord made me, he made a ramblin' man

Let me travel this land
From the mountains to the sea
'Cause that's the life I believe
He meant for me
And when I'm gone, and at my grave you stand
Just say God's called home your ramblin' man",Ramblin' Man,2000
Hank Williams III,"Well, they gave him his orders at Monroe, Virginia
Said, Steve you're way behind time
This is not Thirty-Eight; this is old Ninety-Seven,
So put her into Spencer on time

Then he turned and said to his black, greasy fireman
Shovel on a little more coal
And when we cross that White Oak Mountain,
Watch old Ninety-Seven roll

And then the telegram came from Washington station
And this is how it read:
Oh that brave engineer that ran old Ninety-Seven
Is lying in old Danville dead

'Cause he was going down the grade makin' ninety miles an hour
When the whistle broke into a scream
He was found in the wreck, with his hand on the throttle,
Scalded to death by the steam

Now all you ladies you better take warnin'
From this time on and learn
Never speak harsh words to a true lovin' husband
He may leave you and never return

'Board 'board

Yodelay he, he, he, he, he, he",Wreck of the Old '97,2002
Hank Williams III,"Livin' alone,
Singin' my songs
Thinkin' bout the good times 
When you were my own

Lady you taught me 
How to hurt and cry, 
And each day I'm not with you 
I die more inside

Honey sweet lady why did you go? 
And leave me here dying 
All alone in my world?
It's all gone wrong
Since you've been gone

So give me 5 shots of whiskey 
To help kill the misery and pain 
You put me through
Thanks for the good times, 
For they were the best of my life 
I spent with you
Now what can I do?

Walkin' on Broadway 
Not havin a care 
I see you and your new guy 
Who's strokin' your hair
And I can't keep staying 
Here in my hometown,
Got to get on with my life somehow 
It's all gone wrong 
Since you've been gone

So give me 5 shots of whiskey 
To help kill the misery and pain 
You put me through

I spent with you
And I still love you",5 Shots of Whiskey,2002
Hank Williams III,"Well I'm leavin' Mississippi 
And I'm looking for higher ground
Said 7 long months 39 days to turn my ways around

Well I ain't proud of the things I've done
So I've got to change it now

To that judge in black

So he picked up his pen and he put me away

I grew up fast and it shows

Cause livin' the nightlife is where I belong 
And drinkin' with the drunks who don't want to go home

And I'm from a little town 
And people don't think much of me

Why they thought I was no good 
But this is how it seems 

The feelings of this worn out cowboy 
Will make you feel so cold

Will make you feel so cold

I'm raisin hell and tryin to find a life, livin fast and dyin young it's my new style of life. Me and friends we like livin on the run just because we're wild I guess they don't like where we come from.
Hell we all like to get drunk and fall down all over town you know that each damn day that we're livin we;re damn right and rebel proud.
Well the wind keeps gettin colder but I never let that hold me back
I've done the best that I could do to keep my life on track.
Now I'm countin out quarters tryin to buy some beer,It's so god damn lonely since your not here.

Because his heart was made of knotty pine. 

Kaw-liga was a lonely Indian, never went nowhere. 
His heart was set on the Indian maid with the coal black hair.
Kaw-liga just stood there and never let it show, 
So she could never answer ""yes"" or ""no."" 

And then one day a wealthy customer bought the Indian maid, 
And took her, oh, so far away, but ol' Kaw-liga stayed.

And every eye was fixed on those cloudly skies above

It was once in the saddle I used to go gay

Take me to the green valley there lay the sod o'er me
For I'm a young cowboy and I know I've done wrong

Put bunches of roses all over my coffin but roses to deaden the sod as they fall
Then swing your ropes slowly and raddle your spurs lowly
And give a wild yell as you carry me along
And in the grave throw me and rove the sod o'er me
For I'm a young cowboy and I know I've done wrong
Go bring me some water a cup of cold water

To cool my parched lips the cowboy then said
Before I return his soul had departed and gone to the roundup the cowpoke was dead

I dreamed about mama last night
She read me the Bible like she used to do
I dreamed about mama last night

She never close her eyes and sleep till we were all in bed
And on party nights till we came home she often sat and read
We little thought about it then for we were young and gay
Just how much mama worried when we children were away

We only knew she never slept when we were out at night
That she waited just to know that we'd all come home alright
Why sometimes when we'd stay away till one or two or three
It seemed to us that mama heard the turnin' of the key

For always when we'd step aside she'd call and we'd reply
But we were all too young back then to understand the reason why
Until the last one had returned she'd always keep a light
For mama couldn't sleep until she kissed us all goodnight

She had to know that we were safe before she went to rest
Well she seemed to fear that the world might harm
The ones that she loved the best
And once she told me when you're grown to women and to men
Perhaps I'll sleep the whole night through I may be different then

And so it seemed that night and day we knew a mother's care
That always when we got back home we'd find her waitin' there
Then came the night that we were called together round her bed
The children are all with you now the kindly doctor said

And in her eyes the gleam again that old time tender light
That told that she's just been waitin' to know we were alright
She smiled that old familiar smile and prayed to God to keep
Her children safe from harm throughout the years
And then she went to sleep

"Hank Williams, Jr.","[Chorus]
A tongue can accuse and carry bad news
The seeds of distrust, it will sow
But unless you've made no mistakes in your life
Be careful of stones that you throw.
 
A neighbor was passing my garden one time
She stopped and I knew right away 
That it was gossip, not flowers, she had on her mind 
And this is what I heard my neighbor say:

""That girl down the street should be run from our midst
She drinks and she talks quite a lot 
She knows not to speak to my child or to me."" 
My neighbor then smiled and I thought

[Chorus]

A car speeded by and the screamin' of brakes
A sound that made my blood chill
For my neighbor's one child had been pulled from the path
And saved by a girl lying still.

The child was unhurt and my neighbor cried out
""Oh! who was that brave girl so sweet?"" 
I covered the crushed, broken body and said
""The bad girl who lived down the street.""

"Hank Williams, Jr.","Now friend if you'll just listen to me you'll get some good hard earned advice
I don't aim to meddle in your business I'm just tryin' to save you an awful price

Now you see these teeth that I ain't got and these knots on my bald head
I'll guarantee you boys I didn't get them there lyin' at home in the bed
Now take the smart aleck in any town of him folks want no part
He acts like his head was only made to hold his ears apart
Now he might like what I'm bout to say and my words might make him sore
But I'm just tryin' to be helpful cause I've been down that road before

To bully folks and play mean tricks was once my pride and joy
Till one day I was toted home and mama didn't know her little boy
My head was swelled up so doggone big I couldn't get it through my front door
Now I ain't just talkin' to hear myself cause I've been down that road before

A little fellow about my size got tired of being pushed about
So he went to work and when he got through he'd knocked every one of my teeth out
One time too many I'd rubbed him wrong and he evened up the score
Now that's what happens when you get too big for your britches

And I've been down that road before
Now when you get to thinkin' you're really smart
There's always somebody smarter than you

And no matter how much you boast and brag you can still learn a thing or two
Go get you some treatments just like I've had and you won't hanker for more
I really learned the meaning of living and loving I've been down that road before
Now the man that walks this rocky road usually gets just what he deserves

Cause he's just a helpless servant to a master that he serves
Now I've learned to slow my temper down and not to pick no scraps no more

Just a picture from life's other side someone has fell by the way

And he drowses dead mother's ring from her finger
That she wore long ago on her wedding day
It's his last earthly treasure but he stakes it
Then bows his head that his shame he might hide
But when they lifted his head they found he was dead
That's just a picture from life's other side

Now the last scene is that by the river of a heartbroken mother and babe

While girls beguiled with lipstick danced to saxophones

We opened up the underworld to the ones we loved so well
So tell me gentlemen is it right to send her to a cell
If she drinks while you taught her and if she smokes you showed her how
So gentlemen do you think it's right to condemn her now
And when you're in that jury room just remember there and then
That for every fallen woman there's a hundred fallen men

And before you render a verdict on what this girl has done
Just remember there's a man to blame and that man might be your son

"Hank Williams, Jr.","Last night all alone in a barroom
Met a girl with a drink in her hand. 
She had ruby red lips, coal black hair 
And eyes that would tempt any man.
Then she came and sat down at my table,
And as she placed her soft hands in mine,
I found myself wanting to kiss her 
For temptation was flowing like wine.
 
And I was almost persuaded to strip myself of my pride.
Almost persuaded to push my conscience aside.
Then we danced and she whispered, ""I need you!""
""Take me away from here and be my man.""
Then I looked into her eyes and I saw it:
 
The reflection of my wedding band.
And I was almost persuaded to let strange lips lead me on.

"Hank Williams, Jr.","It was colder than a well digger's ankles in Cutbank, Montana.
But my heart was on fire as I saw her step down from the train.
I'd been up there forever, but her arms were finally around me.
All my icicles melted away at the sound of her name.

I held her to me as tightly as I held her letter,
That said ""I don't love him. I'm leaving this cold mean man.""
As the train pulled away from the platform
And I put her in the wagon,
With her head on my shoulder, God knows I was one happy man.

And I went to heaven that night in her arms in my cabin.
In the winter of '94 there burned such a powerful flame.
They still hear her voice in the cabin in Cutbank, Montana.
And the icicles all melt away at the sound of her name.

Hell rode into town one night on a Wyoming stallion.
His heart full of hate and his eyes full of cold jealousy.
""One way or another,"" he said,
""partner, I'm taking back my woman.""
With my hand on my gun, I said, ""Don't bet your life.
The lady says she's staying with me.""
His knife was a flash in the light of the kerosene lantern
That fell as we tangled and fought in the fire on the floor.
He was a dead man, but I have been too since I lost her.
From the fire that burned me so bad as I crawled through the door.

Humble you should be when they come passing by, 
For its written that the greatest of men never get to big to cry. 
Some lose faith in love and life when sorrow shoots her darts, 
With hope all gone, they walk alone these men with broken hearts. 
You've never walked in that man's shoes or saw things through his eyes, 
Or stood and watched with helpless hands while the heart inside you dies. 

Some were porpers, some were kings, some were masters of the arts, 
But in their shame they're all the same, these men with broken hearts.

I've had more then enough money in my bank account, 
But where they went and how it got spent isn't really clear. 
They just left me here and it all disappeared. 

Sitting in another office Tuesday morning, application filled. 
I doubt they'll ever call me but I can't keep from hoping that they will. 
I know I need to keep my chin up but I'm telling you the truth, 
If there's no one else to live for is there anything left to lose?

I'd probably run for President of the Southern States
The day Elvis passed away would be our national holiday

I'd make my Supreme Court down in Texas
And we wouldn't have no killers getting off free
If they were proven guilty, then they would swing quickly
Instead of writin' books and smilin' on TV

We'd all learn Cajan cookin' in Louisiana
And I'd put that capital back in Alabama
We'd put Florida on the right track, 'cause we'd take Miami back
And throw all them pushers in the slammer

I'd have all the whiskey made in Tennessee
And all the horses raised in those Kentucky hills
The national treasury would be in Tupelo, Mississippi
And I'd put Hank Williams picture on one hundred dollar bill

I'd have all the cars made in the Carolinas
And I'd ban all the ones made in China
I'd have every girl child sent to Georgia to learn to smile
And talk with that southern accent that drives men wild

I'd have all the fiddles made in Virginia
'Cause they sure can make 'em sound so fine
I'm going up on Wolverton Mountain and see ole Clifton Clowers
And have a sip of his good ole Arkansas wine

With a head full of music and an old nursery rhyme
A heart full of sadness and dark sunken nights

The strength from his youth and the songs from his soul

And he called them miners mother load finders
Digging so deep in search of more gold
Oh where are the cowboys and the home on the range
Does anyone know that they've killed Jesse James

And the old Nashville cowboys missed out on the change

The distant moan of a midnight train,
Comes blowin' through the night.
He dips his pen in tears and pain,
And he begins to write.

And the Indian he once knew.
Bout lost highways, and purple skies,

"Hank Williams, Jr.","From thirty thousand feet above the desert floor I see it there below 
A city with a legend, the West Texas city of El Paso 
Where long ago I heard a song about a Texas cowboy and a girl 
And a little place called Rosa's where he used to go and watch this beauty whirl 

I don't recall who sang the song but I recall a story that I heard 
And as I look down on this city I remember each and every word 
The singer sang about a jealous cowboy and the way he used a gun 
To kill another cowboy, then he had to leave El Paso on the run 

El Paso City 
By the Rio Grande 
The cowboy lived and rode away but love was strong he couldn't stay 
He rode back just to die in that El Paso sand 
El Paso City 
By the Rio Grande 
I try not to let you cross my mind but still I find
There's such a mystery in the song that I don't understand 

My mind is down there somewhere as I fly above the badlands of New Mexico 
I can't explain why I should know the very trail he rode back to El Paso 
Can it be that man can disappear from life and live another time 
And does the mystery deepen 'cause you think that you yourself lived in that other time 

Somewhere in my deepest thoughts familiar scenes and memories unfold 
These wild and unexplained emotions that I've had so long, but I have never told 
Like everytime I fly up through the heavens and I see you there below 
I get the feeling sometime in another world I lived in El Paso 

El Paso City 
By the Rio Grande 
Could it be that I could be the cowboy in the mystery 
That died there in that desert sand so long ago 
El Paso City 
By the Rio Grande 
A voice tells me to go and seek, another voice keeps telling me 
Maybe death awaits me in El Paso

Hank Wilson,"I had a friend named Camble, eat, cheat and steal and gamble

He was out tomcattin' one night when he started a great big fight

But at the railroad station they took him by the arm
The chief said, ""I've come for you"", and Bil said, ""Now this won't do
Because Bill Camble never was my name""

He's in the jailhouse now, he's in the jailhouse now
Oh yes, he broke out and all over town the fool walked about
He's in the jailhouse now

Then I met Bill's old gal Sadie and she said
""Have you seen my baby?""
And I told her he was down town in the can
Litlle Sadie she started fussin'
She went down to the jailhouse a-cussin'
She says, ""I come down here to get my man""

She's in the jailhouse now, she's in the jailhouse now
So you can understand why little old Sadie got throwed in the can
She's in the jailhouse now

I went out last Tuesday, met a sweet little gal named Suzie
I'd say she was the sweetest thing around
She started to callin' me honey and we began to spent my money
Then we got drunk and thought we owned the town

We're in the jailhouse now, we're in the jailhouse now

There's a sadness in my heart, many thoughts to think
A letter to be written, things should be said
I stare out my window, and it starts to rain

Now how should I put this for you to see
Never wanted to hurt you, just believe in me
But I was misleaded, burned my fingers in fire
Now you feel mistreated, now I feel like a liar

We used to love each other forever more
You think we should still bother or let it go
See I'm a hard luck woman and you're not a lucky star
Though we messed it up now, let's get back to the start

You enjoy your freedom, or so they say
But your eyes aren't shining like yesterday
Now the odds are against me, I just wanna try
The flame's still burning deep inside

You used to call me baby, not anymore
Now you call me a cheater, I know the score
Yes I'm a hard luck woman, but you're not a stone cold man
I'm not quitting on this while I still can
I know I'm your woman, you know you're my man

Everyone has a dream, every play has a scene
Every night, every day is a lifetime
Every joyce, every voice tears apart my heart
All the days of my life I've waited
And the hope never has really faded

We used to love each other, we know we do
So maybe we should bother and stop playing a fool
I'll be your hard luck woman, would you be my hard luck man
The flame's still burning, just take my hand
I know I'm your woman, you know you're my man

I wait for you and you come around.

Of kids on the street outside.

When you walk into the room,
You pull me close and we start to move.
And we're spinning with the stars above
And you lift me up in a wave of love.

And you bring me home
When I'm lost at sea I hear your voice
And it carries me

In this world we're just beginning
To understand the miracle of living.
Baby, I was afraid before
But I'm not afraid anymore.

Put a gun against his head,
Pulled my trigger,now he's dead,

Body's aching all the time,
Goodbye everybody I've got to go
Gotta leave you all behind and face the truth
Mama ooh (Any way the wind blows)
I don't want to die,
I sometimes wish I'd never been born at all

I see a little silhouetto of a man,
Scaramouche, Scaramouche will you do the fandango
Thunderbolt and lightning very very frightening me
Galileo, Galileo,
Galileo, Galileo
Galileo Figaro, magnifico
But I'm just a poor boy and nobody loves me
He's just a poor boy from a poor family
Spare him his life from this monstrosity
Easy come easy go,will you let me go
Bismillah, no,we will not let you go, let him go
Bismillah, we will not let you go, let him go
Bismillah, we will not let you go, let me go
Will not let you go, let me go
Will not let you go, let me go
No, no, no, no, no, no, no
Mama mia, mama mia, mama mia let me go
Beelzebub has a devil put aside for me,for me,for me

So you think you can stone me and spit in my eye
So you think you can love me and leave me to die
Oh baby, can't do this to me baby
Just gotta get out, just gotta get right outta here

Nothing really matters,
Anyone can see,
Nothing really matters,nothing really matters to me,

Any way the wind blows",Bohemian Rhapsody,2003

I really love the role I play
The songs I sing

Suddenly, so far out of reach
Wish that they could see
That underneath

I get bored, I get scared,

Take away the glamour the world that is show
And forget everything you know
Take away the mirrors, the limo's, the lights
I don't wanna dress up tonight

I'm gonna put on my old blue jeans
Gonna walk out of here into the street
Would you put up resistance
Would it make a difference
Would you know the real me
Me in my old blue jeans

You think I'm unapproachable
That I don't feel enough
Should read a book cover to cover
And not be so quick to judge

Take away the glamour the makeup the clothes
And forget everything you know
Take away the ego the trick of the light
I don't wanna dress up tonight

Put away the secrets we all keep
Take away the moment that we met
Wanna show you what you get

C’mon guys, tell me what we’re doing
We’re hanging around when we could be all over the pain

It’s Friday but there’s no where to go
Anywhere is cool but we’re not going home
And we can do anything we wanted to
It’s all up to me and you

And the moon is the vibe from above

Anywhere we go

In the school hallway
Just to get next to you
Some days I spend a little extra
Time in the morning
Just to impress you

That it would be you
Saying let's hang out
Then you confess
That there's something special between us
Why don't we find out

But you don't know me
Guess you don't need me
Why you're not seein' what you're missin'

I feel like I'm upside down, and I don't wanna be here
I go right, should have gone left, and I say things I should have not said
Look at me in this big mess, I don't wanna be here

'Cause you smiled at the letter that I sent you today
And I can't wait 'til I see you again
And we'll both say remember when
The band played on the 4th of July
And you held me on your shoulders way up high

You're still there for me, wherever there might be
And if an ocean lies between us
I'll send a message across the sea
That you can sleep tonight, knowing it's alright
I believe that you were listening to my song
You're with me
You've been here all along

You've been here all along

Back then, you walked me to school
Told me to be careful and I followed the rules
Fast forward, you taught me to drive
You gave me the keys and we went for a ride
And I can't wait 'til I see you again
And we both say remember when
I'm holding on to moments like that
And I know that they're coming back

You're still there for me, wherever there might be
And if an ocean lies between us
I'll send a message across the sea
That you can sleep tonight, knowing it's alright
I believe that you were listening to my song
You're with me
You've been here all along

Yeah,
All along the way, I keep you in my heart and in my prayers
You'll always be the one who cares the most
Counting on the day I see you running out to say
I missed you, I missed you

You're still there for me, wherever there might be
And if an ocean lies between us
I'll send a message across the sea
That you can sleep tonight, knowing it's alright
I believe that you were listening to my song

You're still there for me, wherever there might be
And if an ocean lies between us
I'll send a message across the sea

There'd be laughter there'd be tears

With so much joy but so much pain

I'll keep them here inside
All the times that we shared every place everywhere
You touched my life
Yeah one day we'll look back we'll smile and we'll laugh

I've got to be strong and trust where you're heading

You always let me be me

I'm a down and dusky blonde
I am living in a tree
When I lie in bed I see
Beyond my lover's head the moon, I hear the rain

I am conscious of my voice as a tool
It's more demure
Than your friend the singing queen
With her matinee good looks
She talks like talking from a book
I speak the language of my village, of my street

But I need a friend and I choose you
I tell you the way I feel
The truth is crushing like a heel
I will forget the kiss and feel if you will too

Tell me tales of punk rockin' girls
It's a dim and distant page
But I mostly blame my age
Please make allowances for me
I do not see

It's a drag that you're getting old
I love to think about the year
When we sobbed and then we cheered
The town deserted like a film
The sun was baking dust for fun
Trees were withering by the day
Your torso crushing me
Into the country and the tunnels and the fields

But I need a friend and I choose you
I tell you the way I feel
The truth is crushing like a heel
I will forget the kiss and feel if you will do

I read a book a day, like an apple
But I did not eat
And so the doctor came to me
He said a woman does not live
By the printed word
Forgive yourself and eat

Autumn sped along outside
Trick photography on speed
I was locked inside a room
They made a deal, they would control
The simple things like bodies
But I kept my soul

When I needed someone I chose you
Because the fledgling soul awakes
And on the balcony she quakes
And she is waiting for the sign
And when the brother does not come
And when the sister's much to you, she chooses you",Down and Dusky Blonde,2014

To the news of my birth
I am a girl and I'm lucky to be here

With my head in the sand
Slipped into corners
Sat on my hands
I learnt to stifle shouts and outrage
And feeling deep down

And the hope in a friend
Cafes and walkways
And sculptured weekends
I'm getting to love my freedom
I'm getting to like my surroundings

Of any such love

My diary's quiet
The definitive nail
In my social coffin
I blame all the boffins
For making me fail

For an hour in the park
Or an hour on the couch
With the boy of my choice
If he makes me go ""ouch!""
I will swap all my dumb school prizes
I am open to dark surprises

At twelve o' clock, I unlock my hate, 
I get the meanest kind of 
Lonesome midnight blues. 

Those lonesome midnight blues",Midnight Blues,1995
Hannah Thomas,"Here I come to find myself, catch the tide, 
Looking for a peace at the end of the line. 
Sometimes I can't help myself, fever's high, 
I'm all at sea and so unwise. 

I'm so afraid I'll lose your love, as time goes by, 
But courage is a fire and a beacon so bright. 
The sunset built a memory, our love sign, 
And all at sea we come alive. 

Will I wash away, turning like a stone? 
I need a place where I belong. 
Call a setting sun to throw me down a rope 
And take me to a place called home. 

I close my eyes, I know you're there, love of mine, 
Standing on the shore in a world I design. 
The sunset fires a lonely flare into the sky, 
And all at sea we say goodbye. 

Will I wash away, turning like a stone? 
I need a place where I belong. 
Call a setting sun to throw me down a rope 
And take me to a place called home.

His head filled with helium
Pulled me up so I couldn't walk

To hang on to my balloon
And to be shown a glimpse of the truth
Made my cheek flush and my mouth smile
My chest's like a cage full of butterflies
It tickled and I laugh:
”such a rare, rare joy”

Suddenly the balloon loosened itself, he said:
“I have to move further on, I'll keep on flying
Keep on showing the truth from my point of view,”

Time has come to sacrifice

We are warriors,
Born from the light
An army for freedom,
Defenders of life
Warriors,
Euphoria will rise
Returning from darkness
We bury all lies

The knights,
Outcast and lost in the skies
Returning to heaven denied
Louder than thunder we ride
Ready to strike

Call for us and you will survive
Follow us to paradise

We are warriors,

An army for freedom,

Hannes Medwenitsch,"Für dieses Welt da scheint mein Leben
Von Schmerz und Leiden stets verschont
Und niemand wagt es zu erahnen,
Dass hier ein finst'rer Schatten wohnt

Dass in der Hülle, die da scheint
Als ob nur Freude ihr entspringt
Ein schwarzes Loch stets um sich greift
Eine Seel' um's überleben ringt

Doch irgendwo in finst'rer Nacht
Scheint ein Stern für mich in seiner Pracht
Er scheint für mich, für all mein Leid
Und träumt wie ich von Geborgenheit

Was ist es was mich dazu bringt
Sobald Menschen mich umringen
Und Wörter wie aus Strömen fließen
In eine Rolle mich zu zwingen

Das ist mein Leben und mein Fluch
Ein Auge lacht, das andere weint
Und mein Mund in Deinem Auge
Immerfort zu lächeln scheint

Scheint ein Stern für mich in seiner Pracht
Er weint für mich, für all mein Leid

Über Juden Witze machen,
Über Menschenrechte lachen,

Muss nun mal die Welt genesen,
Dann steh auf und misch dich ein:

Dir galant den Weg versperren
Ihre Blicke unter Lallen
Nur in Deinen Ausschnitt fallen.
Wenn sie prahlen von der Alten,
Die sie sich zu Hause halten,
Denn das Weib ist nur 'was wert
Wie dereinst an Heim und Herd,
Tritt nicht ein in den Verein,
Sage nein!

Und wenn sie in deiner Schule
Plötzlich lästern über Schwule,
Schwarze Kinder spüren lassen,
Wie sie andre Rassen hassen,

Hannibal Buress,"And now a message from Hannibal Buress
Blaa, uh, sorry, sorry
And now a message from Hannibal Buress

Aye, mane, I'm fucking with this shit. It's good to listen to a professional rapper for once, but Lil Dicky is a horrible rap name. That's some weird shit; you got grown men having to call you Lil Dicky in the streets like ""Aye, what's up Lil Dicky. Bars man, you be spittin' bars"". That's real inconsiderate for you to make that your rap name and it's probably - Is that the worst rap name? I saw a dude named Hogman, The Intruder, no, I just made that up, but it's it's not the worst rap name I've heard at all, man

Here's some tips if you rappers wanna be more professional:
First of all, stop rappin' over your own vocals at your concert. Clear your goddamn instrumental and rap over it, I don't wanna hear you rappin' over your raps, muthafuckas. Also, stop have thirty five people on stage - who are these people?! Are you travelin' with these people or did you hire them locally? Did you pay for their travel? Get all of those muthafuckas off of the stage. It's confusing. I don't like it. You can't do that at other jobs. You can't be an accountant like ""Hey I'm about to do your taxes, here's my thirty friends just standin' around doing nothing while I do your taxes""; fuck outta here

Also, stop talkin' 'bout the same shit. I don't think you have a fresh take on havin' money. I'm tired of hearing about it, I don't, I don't think it's interesting. These muthafuckas need to mix it up. I think I've heard every perspective on havin' money or I used to have money and I oh I got money, I didn't have money, I got more money than you'll ever get, I never thought I would get this much money, I had money now I'm getting more money. Stop getting soo many chains. You don't need that many chains - you only need one chain. Or if you're 2 Chainz, you can have two chains, but not more than that",Hannibal Interlude,2015

Gonna send you a postcard from Hanoi,

To the smell of romance, 
As I see my geisha girl dance

Round and round the world goes around, 
I used to believe I was such a happy guy
Now I've found my place on earth, 
Leavin for Europe just can't be worth
Baby, baby, won't you take my hand, 
To aikido garden
Well you understand,

But never mind what they say,
I ain't goin' back home,

I tried to hide 'em inside, tried to push your love away

To miss the bus or I'll go and miss all the fuss

'cause this time it's a must
I'm gonna meet the boys and Suzy
I just can't miss her tonight
Tonight I'm so hot, gee, I'm so hot

Well, is she tight?
Is she in need of a lover like me?
Oh, there she is now
I gotta go and give her a great big kiss

And now that I'm in her I don't wanna lose her
These moments are takin' me to heaven
But they don't seem to take her anywhere at all
I wonder what is wrong, please, tell me what is wrong

That 'Punks never die', hot love in the nights
The days we spent underground

Accidents happens about everyday
But that day special 'cause Peter was taken away
And Suzy, she moved to another town

Is writings on the walls, I wonder were all the

Close To The Edge

I. The Solid Time Of Change
Anderson/Howe

A seasoned witch could call you from the depths of your disgrace,
And rearrange your liver to the solid mental grace,
And achieve it all with music that came quickly from afar,
Then taste the fruit of man recorded losing all against the hour.
And assessing points to nowhere, leading ev'ry single one.
A dewdrop can exalt us like the music of the sun,
And take away the plain in which we move,
And choose the course you're running.

Down at the edge, round by the corner,
Not right away, not right away.
Close to the edge, down by a river,
Not right away, not right away.

Crossed the line around the changes of the summer,
Reaching to call the color of the sky.
Passed around a moment clothed in mornings faster than we see.
Getting over all the time I had to worry,
Leaving all the changes far from far behind.
We relieve the tension only to find out the master's name.

Down at the end, round by the corner.
Close to the edge, just by a river.
Seasons will pass you by.
I get up, I get down.
Now that it's all over and done,
Now that you find, now that you're whole.

II. Total Mass Retain
Anderson/Squire

My eyes convinced, eclipsed with the younger moon attained with love.
It changed as almost strained amidst clear manna from above.
I crucified my hate and held the word within my hand.
There's you, the time, the logic, or the reasons we don't understand.

Sad courage claimed the victims standing still for all to see,
As armoured movers took approach to overlook the sea.
There since the cord, the license, or the reasons we understood will be.

Down at the edge, close by a river.
Close to the edge, round by the corner.
Close to the end, down by the corner.
Down at the edge, round by the river.

Sudden call shouldn't take away the startled memory.
All in all, the journey takes you all the way.
As apart from any reality that you've ever seen and known.
Guessing problems only to deceive the mention,
Passing paths that climb halfway into the void.
As we cross from side to side, we hear the total mass retain.

Down at the edge, round by the corner.
Close to the end, down by a river.
Seasons will pass you by.
I get up, I get down.

III. I Get Up, I Get Down
Anderson/Howe

In her white lace
You can clearly see the lady sadly looking.
Saying that she'd take the blame
For the crucifixion of her own domain.

I get up, I get down,
I get up, I get down.
Two million people barely satisfy.
Two hundred women watch one woman cry, too late.
The eyes of honesty can achieve.
How many millions do we deceive each day?

[Thru the duty she would coil their said
Amusement of her story asking only interest
Could be laid upon the children of her domain]

I get up, I get down.
I get up, I get down.

In charge of who is there in charge of me.
Do I look on blindly and say I see the way?
The truth is written all along the page.
How old will I be before I come of age for you?
I get up, I get down.
I get up, I get down.
I get up, I get down.

IV. Seasons Of Man
Anderson/Howe

The time between the notes relates the color to the scenes.
A constant vogue of triumphs dislocate man, so it seems.
And space between the focus shape ascend knowledge of love.
As song and chance develop time, lost social temp'rance rules above.
Ah, ah.

Then according to the man who showed his outstretched arm to space,
He turned around and pointed, revealing all the human race.
I shook my head and smiled a whisper, knowing all about the place.
On the hill we viewed the silence of the valley,
Called to witness cycles only of the past.
And we reach all this with movements in between the said remark.

Close to the edge, down by the river.
Down at the end, round by the corner.
Seasons will pass you by,
Now that it's all over and done,
Called to the seed, right to the sun.
Now that you find, now that you're whole.
Seasons will pass you by,
I get up, I get down.
I get up, I get down.
I get up, I get down.


And You And I

I. Cord Of Life
Anderson/Bruford/Howe/Squire

A man conceived a moment's answers to the dream.
Staying the flowers daily, sensing all the themes.
As a foundation left to create the spiral aim,
A movement regained and regarded both the same,
All complete in the sight of seeds of life with you.
Changed only for a sight of sound, the space agreed.
Between the picture of time behind the face of need,
Coming quickly to terms of all expression laid,
Emotion revealed as the ocean maid,
All complete in the sight of seeds of life with you.
Oh.

Coins and crosses

Turn round tailor, assaulting

Never know their fruitless worth;

all the mornings of the interest shown,

presenting one another to the cord,

Cords are broken,

All left dying, rediscovered

Of the door that turned round,

Locked inside the mother earth.

To close the cover, all the

interest shown,

They won't hide, hold, they won't tell you,

To turn one another, to the sign at the time float your climb.

Watching the world, watching all of the world,

Watching us go by.

And you and I climb over the sea to the valley,
And you and I reached out for reasons to call.

II. Eclipse
Anderson/Bruford/Squire

Coming quickly to terms of all expression laid,
Emotion revealed as the ocean maid,
As a movement regained and regarded both the same,
All complete in the side of seeds of life with you.

III. The Preacher the Teacher
Anderson/Bruford/Howe/Squire

Sad preacher nailed upon the coloured door of time;
Insane teacher be there reminded of the rhyme.
There'll be no mutant enemy we shall certify;
Political ends, as sad remains, will die.
Reach out as forward tastes begin to enter you.
Ooh, ooh.

I listened hard but could not see
Life tempo change out and inside me.
The preacher trained in all to lose his name;
The teacher travels, asking to be shown the same.
In the end, we'll agree, we'll accept, we'll immortalize
That the truth of the man maturing in his eyes,
All complete in the sight of seeds of life with you.

Coming quickly to terms of all expression laid,
As a moment regained and regarded both the same,
Emotion revealed as the ocean maid,
A clearer future, morning, evening, nights with you.

IV. Apocalypse
Anderson/Bruford/Howe/Squire

And you and I climb, crossing the shapes of the morning.
And you and I reach over the sun for the river.
And you and I climb, clearer, towards the movement.
And you and I called over valleys of endless seas.


Siberian Khatru
Anderson/Howe/Wakeman

Sing, bird of prey;
Beauty begins at the foot of you. Do you believe the manner?
Gold stainless nail,
Torn through the distance of man
As they regard the summit.

Even Siberia goes through the motions.
Hold out and hold up;
Hold down the window.

Outbound, river,

Hold out the morning that comes into view.

Bluetail, tailfly.

River running right on over my head.

How does she sing?
Who holds the ring? And ring and you will find me coming.
Cold reigning king,
Hold all the secrets from you
As they produce the movement.

Even Siberia goes through the motions.
Hold out and hold up;
Hold down the window.

Outbound, river,

Hold out the morning that comes into view.

Bluetail, tailfly.

River running right over the outboard, river,
Bluetail, tailfly,
Luther, in time.
Dude'ndoodit, dah, d't-d't-dah.

Hold down the window;
Hold out the morning that comes into view.
Warm side, the tower;
Green leaves reveal the heart spoken Khatru.

Gold stainless nail,
Torn through the distance of man as they regard the summit.
Cold reigning king,
Shelter the women that sing
As they produce the movement.
River running right on over my head

Outboard, river.

Bluetail, tailfly,
Luther, in time,
Suntower, asking,
Cover, lover,
June cast, moon fast,
As one changes,
Heart gold, leaver,
Soul mark, mover,
Christian, changer,
Called out, saviour,
Moon gate, climber,
Turn round, glider.

Alone and abandoned

Feeling the wind and the icy cold rain
Feeling each step, destiny hidden 
All to aware of the fear and the pain
Feeling the sting of true betrayal 
Now I have no one to trust but myself
I am now one, no more believer 
Yet there is still wind to fill my sail

A paradise I seek shall be found 
The only one I'll know
I challenge failure to cut me down 
Cause it's onward I shall go
My power strength shall never die
As long as I stay alive
One word shall always be by my side 
Ever moving onward!!!!

Battles I've won, 
The war I have lost 
My blood and my tears 
They are equally spilled
The risk I shall take, 
The feel of the cost
The prophecies of shattered dreams 
Now fulfilled
The specters they watch, 
I can hear them laugh 
Yet I will impale onto their doubting eyes
Victory due one of these days 
Revenge will silently 
Come all in due time

Onward on, never underestimate my force of will
Onward on, never I will hesitate to know 
That I will fight!!

Onward I walk, with each step now close
But closer to something that might not be there
Using the rage, feeling the hunger 
The book that I read always has a new page
Come strike me down, take all that you need 
Resilience is my new found weapon of choice
Again I will rise, one day I will win
As long as I sing onward cry from my voice!!",Onward,2002

In deeper to somewhere we could lie
And rest for the the day with cold in the way
Were we ever colder on that day 
A million miles away

The moments seemed lost in all the noise
A snow storm a stimulating voice
Of warmth of the sky of warmth when you die

But at every place they said to his face 
Now get out, get out, get out of here

All through the wintertime he hid himself away 
Ashamed to show his face, afraid of what others might say 
All through the winter in his lonely clump of wheat 
Till a flock of swans spied him there and very soon agreed 

You’re a very fine swan indeed! 
A swan? Me a swan? Ah, go on! 
And he said yes, you’re a swan 
Take a look at yourself in the lake and you’ll see 
And he looked, and he saw, and he said 
I am a swan! Whee!

I’m not such an ugly duckling 
No feathers all stubby and brown

Footsteps that you hear down the hall.

She gave your very first kiss to you,
That was Laura but she's only a dream.",Laura,1996

Is it your alluring way?
Could you always drown the fire? 
Keep a check on all you feel 
Keep a hold on your desire 
But I feel there?s something new 
And it?s lying in your eyes 
There?s a shudder running through...
You... now I realize 

(CHORUS)
Inside turning to outside 
The feeling you can?t hide 
Is touching a high-light in your eyes 
Inside turning to outside 
It?s gonna be alright 
It?s runnin? a high for you and I

Like a shadow of yourself 
Like a spirit in the air 
Looking desp?rately for help

Hide away under peaceful skies

Hans Wahlgrens Orkester,"Nu lyser ängarna av sommarns alla blommor
Nu surrar bin, och fåglar sjunger överallt
Nu stryker vinden genom trädens höga kronor
men i min trädgård är det visset, mörkt och kallt
Här är det risigt och förvuxet, fult och snårigt
och lika hopplöst trist och grått som i mitt bröst
Därute doftar det av sommarns alla dofter
Där är det sommar, men härinne är det høst

Jag levde lycklig här med dig och mina katter
ett liv i synd och utan omsorg att bli frälst
Försonad med min karaktär, för jag har aldrig
förmått at säga nej till någonting som helst
Och aldrig nekat mig det ena eller andra
och levat livet, tills jag krossades en dag
Det börja med att du bedrog mig med en anna
en som du sa mar mycket finare än jag

Vårt gräl tog veckor, ropen blandades med gråten
och jag blev grundligt jämförd med din fina vän
tills du bekände att han givit dig på båten
Då blev det dödstyst här i trädgården igen!
Ifrån den stunden var den mannen dubbelt hatad
Han hade lekt med dig, med oss et litet slag
Och jag, jag kände det som även jag var ratad
Jag ville slåss, och gick mot mitt livs nederlag

Jag hade hammaren beredd under kavajen
när han kom ut i sidenscarf och sa, God dag
Kom in och slå dig ner en stund, så får vi prata
Jag bare stammade, nu minns jag inte vad
Och jag blev bjuden på cognac och på cigarrer
och kunde inte få mig till att säga nej
Och när vi skildes var vi bästisar och bundis
och jag tog saker som du glömt med hem till dig

Jag går omkring i mitt Pompeji, bland ruiner
jag trampar runt i resterna utav vårt liv
Men du skall aldrig ge mig pikar om sekiner
och aldrig skall du bli en annans tidsfördriv
Nej, åt det gamla skall vi binda vackra kransar
och ta vårt liv och mina katter som de är
Och trots all kärleks brist och trasighet och fransar
Dig skall jag älska livet ut, dig har jag kär!",Trubbel,2005

It's a whale of a tale or two,
About the flappin' fish and girls, I've loved on nights like this, With the moon above.
And a whale of a tale, 
It's all true, 
I swear by my tattoo.
There was Mermaid Minnie, met her down in Madagascar.
She would kiss me,
Anytime that I would ask her.
Then one evening, her flame of love blew out,
Blow me down and pick me up, 
She swapped me for a trout.
Gotta a whale of a tale to tell you lad.
It's a whale of a tale or two,
About the flappin' fish and girls, I've loved on nights like this, With the moon above.
And a whale of a tale, 
It's all true, 
I swear by my tattoo.
There was Typoon Tessie, met on the Coast of Java.
When we kissed I... bubbled up like molten lava.
Then she gave me,
The scare of my young life.
Blow me down and pick me up,
She was the captain's wife.
Gotta a whale of a tale to tell you lad.
It's a whale of a tale or two,
About the flappin' fish and girls, I've loved on nights like this, With the moon above.
And a whale of a tale, 
It's all true, 
I swear by my tattoo.
Then there was Harpoon Hannah,
Had a look that spelled out danger.
My heart quivered, 
When she whispered, ""I'm there stranger.""
Bought her trinkets,
That sailors can't afford.
Sailors can't afford.
And when spent my last red cent,
She tossed my overboard.
Gotta a whale of a tale to tell you lad.
It's a whale of a tale or two,
About the flappin' fish and girls, I've loved on nights like this, With the moon above.
And a whale of a tale, 
It's all true, 
I swear by my tattoo!

Hans-Joachim Roedelius,"Most of the day, we were at the machinery
In the dark sheds that the seasons ignored
I held the levers that guided the signals to the radio
But the words I received, random code, broken fragments from before

Out in the trees, my reason deserting me
Oh, the dark stars cluster over the bay
Then in a certain moment, I lose control
And at last, I am part of the machinery

Where are you?
And the light disappears
As the world makes its circle through the sky",The Belldog,1978
Hans-Joachim Roedelius,"I was just a broken head
I stole the world that others punctured
Now I stumble through the garbage
Slide and tumble, slide and stumble
Beak and claw, remorse reminder
Slide and tumble, slide and stumble
Back and forth and back to nothing
Keep them tidy, keep them humble.


Chop and change to cut the corners
Sharp as razors shiny razors
Stranded on a world that's dying
Never moving, hardly trying.


I was just a broken head
I stole the world that others plundered
Now I stumble through the garbage
Slide and tumble, slide and stumble.

Hans-Joachim Roedelius,"Here we are
Stuck by this river
You and I
Underneath a sky that's ever falling down, down, down
Ever falling down

Through the day
As if on an ocean
Waiting here
Always failing to remember why we came, came, came
I wonder why we came

You talk to me
As if from a distance
And I reply
With impressions chosen from another time, time, time
From another time",By This River,2006

Hansel,"Amigos conocí a una mujer tan preciosa 
Que por bella le di una rosa tiene los ojos azules 
Tan lindos como un reflejo del mar 
Ayer caminando por una avenida 
Al parar de repente en la esquina 
Besé sus labios sentí que era mía aquella linda mujer 
Ya llevo seis meses saliendo con ella es tan fácil de amar 
Todas las noches la llevo conmigo a pasear 
Y la regreso temprano a su casa para que pueda soñar 
Ella es tan frágil tan dulce inocente 
Sin ninguna maldad esta llena de amor 
De cariño y de sinceridad 
Lo mejor que he tenido en mi vida lo puedo jurar 

Amigo esa mujer a quien dices que amas 
Es quien devora mi cuerpo en la cama 
Una tigresa vestida de seda hambrienta por mí 
Ella hace el amor como una salvaje 
Y en cuanto al sexo ella es una insaciable 
Me tiene el cuerpo gastado y cansado de tanto querer 
Ella hace tiempo es mi amante prohibida 
El placer ilegal ni me atrevo ni puedo 
Ni quiero de sus garras escapar 
Es un vicio que llevo en mis venas que no puedo evitar 
Ella la que aparenta ser dulce 
Inocente sin ninguna maldad 
Es la fiera que llena mi vida de felicidad 
Ha logrado envolver a los dos ja que casualidad 

Amigos me alegro tanto que hayan hablado 
Atentamente a los dos he escuchado 
Ahora les pido que escuchen muy bien lo que voy a decir
Después de tanto tiempo de estar separados 
Quiero decirles que al fin me he casado 
Con una dama que un día muy lejos de aquí conocí
Yo imagine que algo estaba pasando cuando un día la vi 
Caminando de brazos de otro presente hoy aquí 
Es difícil tener que aceptarlo la vida es así 
Ella la que es tu novia tan dulce y tu amante 
Hambrienta de placer la que en las tardes 
A oscuras a ustedes logro enloquecer 
Hace años la hice mi esposa 
Ella es mi mujer 

¡Ella jura que nos quiere! 
Fingiendo cariño se apoderó de mi 
Y yo la hice feliz sin saber la realidad 

¡Ella jura que nos quiere! 
En la vida a veces se dan esos casos 
Esa mujer me dejó con el alma hecha pedazos 

¡Ella jura que nos quiere! 
Jamás pude imaginar que con mis buenos amigos 
Ella me fuera a engañar 

¡Ella jura que nos quiere! 
Mordí sus labios acaricie su cuerpo moreno 
Y a mi pobre corazón embriagó de su veneno 

¡Ella jura que nos quiere! 
Ella jura que nos quiere que sin nuestro amor se muere 

¡Ella jura que nos quiere! 
En tiempos de antaño fue mi gran querer 
De ahora en adelante mas nunca en mi vida yo la quiero ver",Por Ella,1985

Sudden blindness upon me
This ray of light is so unknown
From womb of darkness I am born
Lift the veil of shade forever
Like a candle that's within me
I receive the gift of sight
And rise!
This life is a storm that rages on
Fire, wind, the earth and sea are one
I sing before you all like
Orpheus with torch in hand
The cave it still lies within
Like a never ending sin
Paint these walls with crimson light
The phoenix now is taking flight
Stare back to the abyss
""Hades who rules there shall grant thee salvation""
Like the snow that brings December
I am the spark that sets the flame of truth alight
And fight!
And this life is the pain of being born

Don't mess with the boss 
Cruisin' down the air highway in his sleigh 
Bringing all the presents for the next day

Or anything that can be deep-fried

But you don't want to get on his bad side 
You've never seen this side of him before

Not so long ago in a toy room not so far away
Lived a boy who had so many toys
And he didn't know what to do with them all
With them all, with them all
Well, his favorite of all the toys
Were the tin soldiers, the tin soldiers
And the one that he loved the most
Was the one with the missing leg

At night the toys would come alive
Or that's how the story is told
And there they met the soldier
With the missing leg
And the ballerina with the heart of gold
At night they would share each others dreams
Under the stars shining bright
But they were too shy
To speak of love, to speak of love

One day the boy sat them on the windowsill
To watch for the enemy coming over the hill
But when the wind it blew
It knocked him into the street
And the boys from the town they said
Won't you look at the one-legged soldier?
Let's stick him in a boat and send him far away
'Cause we can't find a use
For a soldier with a missing leg

And he was lonely, so lonely for a friend
And he was lonely, so lonely for a friend
He was so lonely, yeah

As he floated past a river rat
On his homemade boat
Well, the boat began to sink
And he sank to the bottom of the river
He got swallowed by a fish
Caught by a fisherman
Sold to the family of the boy who had the toys

And the cook said, look at the one-legged soldier
It looks just like the one we lost the other day
Could this be the boy's tin soldier with the missing leg?

But he was lonely, so lonely for a friend, oh
And he was lonely, so lonely for a friend
He was so lonely, yeah
Oh yeah so lonely, oh yeah

What about the ballerina?

As he sat on the mantle piece to dry from the river
The ballerina who held his heart sat at his side
And when they got up to dance with each other
She fell by the fire blazing bright
When he jumped to save her from the flames
Their bases began to melt into one and the same
And now they share each other's destiny
Together forever they will be

And they are no longer lonely for a friend
And they are no longer lonely for a friend
No longer lonely, yeah
No longer lonely

Yeah, whoa
No longer lonely, yeah

And then I know that I can't live without her

Won't you save me, 'cause saving is what I need
I just want to be by your side
Won't you save me, I don't want to be
Just drifting through the sea of life

Won't you save me
Won't you save me
Won't you save me",Save Me,2000

Riding in seat number 3 on a flight to NYC 
Got my bean in a coffee cup next to my seat 
Catch the view and another good book to read 
Sitting at home over the friendly skies

Turn the radio up, push the pedal to the ground 
And Penny and me like to gaze at starry skies 
Close our eyes, pretend to fly

But it's still Penny and I all alone beneath the sky 
Feel the wind brushing slowly by

Away to where the leaves turn red

They say there is nothing love can't heal

There is nothing gone
But there's something wrong

That I'm stuck here underneath
And you make it hard to breathe?
Take a look around and tell me what you see
You'll find me underneath

But don't know where to begin

Must have a code that you can live by
And so become yourself
Because the past is just a good-bye

Teach your children well
Their father's hell
Will slowly go by
And feed them on your dreams
The one they pick
The one you'll know by.
Don't you ever ask them why
If they told you, you would cry
So just look at them and sigh
And know they love you
And know they love you.

And you, of tender years
Don't know the fears
That your elders grew by
So please help them with your youth
They seek the truth
Before they can die.

(Can you hear and do you care
And can't you see we must be free
To teach our children what you believe in
Make a world that we can believe in.)

Teach your parents well
Their children's hell
Will slowly go by
And feed them on your dreams
The one they pick
The one you'll know by.
Don't you ever ask them why
If they told you, you would cry
So just look at them and sigh
And know they love you
And know thay love you
And know thay love you.

On the dock of the bay
He took a long-term trip on a first class plane
Now the whole world listens
To that one mans song

Does it soothe you
Does it fill your heart and soul with the
Roots of rock and roll
Does it move you
Does it soothe you
Does it fill your heart
And soul with the roots of rock and roll

Well the man in black sits
On a screened in porch
Making birthday wishes, 71 almost
You can hear him singing chariot
Swing low
On the block I live on
In the place I know

Tell me does it move you
Does it soothe you
Does it fill your heart and soul with the

Searching for an answer on a satellite
I know that there's got to be a blue sky out there to see
A blue sky waiting for me

I've felt the moment's passion
