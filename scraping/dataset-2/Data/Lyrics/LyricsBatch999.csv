Sheek Louch,"today's narrator, the Ghost, 
This is a true story ladies and gentlemen
You might not believe it though
But fuck it, that's why I'm the Ghost

I'm about to open up
Listen, one day I fell asleep and my knife woke me up
He said

Your gun is in the closet flippin'
Talkin' bout I get the most action he about to soak me up

So I went to the closet said ""Hammer what's wrong with you?""

You ain't busting me off, it's like I don't belong to you

I said I just beat a case daddy
And I'm trying to take it easy cause I gotta move this weight daddy
Then the hammer said

Man listen, used the knife twice in a row
Tell me if the plan switchin'
Cause we used to get around together
We used to put niggas down together, tell me if it's now or never

I said hammer take it easy baby
'Cause I got niggas to kill and I would never do you greasy baby
And all you gotta do is chill a while
And then the hammer said ""cool"" cause you know that I feel you Styles

[Chorus:]
I got a story to tell, my knife talk to me
But nobody believe that my knife talk to me
I got a story to tell, my hammer talk to me
But nobody believe that my hammer talk to me
I got a story to tell, my haze talk to me
But nobody believe that my haze talk to me
I got a story to tell, my money talk to me
But nobody believe that my money talk to me

My knife said to me

I hawk niggas down, bust arteries

And he get bright red for me
Knife you my nigga but leave me alone
I got to talk to my man Haze to get in the zone
I said ""Haze what the hell is up?""
He said

You know how we do, you know that we crew
So where's the vanilla dutch

Rolling something up, 
Thinking about killing every rapper in the game
And holding something up
My haze said to me

You need to calm down when the rage come to you
'Fore a grave or a cage or a gauge come to you
But you don't give a fuck 
So just open up your book and let your page come to you

Even though I'm humble and noble
I don't give a fuck
You ain't tryin' to hear me I'ma shoot through your mobile
It's funny, I'll stalk you
Hold up my niggas, it ain't a convo 'less your money start talking

[Chorus]

My money spoke to me
It said shit that if it wasn't for his ass there wouldn't be no hope for me
Money ain't everything, and then he laughed at me
And said the hammer oughta blast at me
He said I got you out of jail, paid for the lawyer and bail
Take a look at the cars and the crib
I keep the clothes on your back, food in your mouth
Even paid for the birds when you moved niggas south
Shit, I'm the reason why the block jumping
Let a nigga try to stop something, D-Block'll pop something
And I'm the reason why you ride or die
Keep a lot of me by your side, shoot niggas in the eye
I said money you the root of evil
How they print ""In God We Trust"" knowing what you do to people
But I'm a hard felon
So I grabbed two stacks, dirty and bloody cause I heard my car yelling

[Chorus]",Nobody Believes Me,2002
Sheek Louch,"All for one, one for all
This is motherfucking beautiful
Talk to 'em baby

This for the cold D's that won't snitch
For the murderers that won't miss
For the hustlers that'll front bricks
For the hoodrats that want chips
For the stick-up kids creepin with they Pump's ripped
For lil' shorty with his rhyme books
Black girls going to school, carrying like 9 books
For the hood niggas
That go to work because parole, but they tryin to be good niggas
For all the poor mothers
That's always goin' through the struggle, still screamin at the Lord ""Love us""
For the ghetto life
For having to hold your medal tight lookin' for a better life
For the family
For if I'm rich you rich and that shit's a guarantee
For the best of life
For if I ride you ride the motherfucking rest of life

[Chorus: Styles]
We thugs, my niggas
Ride to the death with my man cause I motherfucking love my niggas
We ghetto, my niggas
Any time, any place, we don't give a fuck we bust metal, my niggas
We gangsta my niggas
You oughta keep your mouth shut
Watch what you sayin cause we shank you, my niggas
We D-Block niggas, we don't play games
We just hit you in your frame cause we pop niggas

Hey yo, yo, I'ma shed blood for mine, that's one ritual
That's how you keep the love unconditional
That's why we the only one the thugs listen to
Bitches buy records but niggas do what bitches do
I know a few dudes doin' life bids in jail
And they way smarter then the white kids in Yale
But that how life is
And that how the gun and the knife is
It's a shame but it's real when your enemies like ya
When ya come through and fishtail in Hennesey Viper
Listen, it ain't the rappers it's the rats that worry me
Double R for life, D-Block til they bury me
Scared niggas shed off
Or stand in the back and aim they gat up in the air and
Let off
Through niggas tear nigga head off, then let the blood keep drippin'
And just wipe the sweat off

[Chorus]

Fuck with P, the thug'll come out
The slug'll come out
You don't put in enough work, I got chu
No doubt
They don't want Sheek to wild
Betta cover ya child
With two guns out the sun-roof
Salt fish style
Who that kid?
Black mask on with the latch on, the AK
Swing on my shoulder like a Louie bag
You get it in a hurry
All up in your Burberry
Through your assistant
Through your fucking secure-tary
All y'all do me a favor
Walk with me
If you want money or drugs
Talk with me
Know I got my niggas my guns
The hawk with me
Guess who? Jada, P, and The Sheek
Three bricks
Three whips
Three motherfucking ouies a week
Ten spots OT
Two blew off late
My niggas cop
Pop and talk, and we applying the pressure
So when you address us
It's Boss
Boss
And Boss

[Chorus]",We Thugs (My ******),2002
Sheek Louch,"[Styles]
Lick a shot for the predicate felons
And gangster niggas that know that 
Doing their time is better than tellin
Don't tell dog, lick a shot for the graveyard shift
And all the hustlers on ninety-five for the graveyard prick
Lick a shot for this weed I need
Just to see clear, to tell the truth I can't breathe a Ki
Lick a shot for the stick up kids that twist up wigs
that's the shit that happens when you pick up bids
Lick a shot for the foreign car, American trucks
Old timers that'll throw a stack of presidents up
Got dice shooter slang, need a pistol to hang
But the P understand cause the ghetto is fucked
Lick a shot for the fiends 
That got to go see the minors on the block to get medicined up
Lick a shot for the sake of licking a shot
And every time I'm far away from home I'll be missing my block
D-Block nigga

[Chorus]
Lick shots for the hood
Yeah nigga we good
Lick shots for the poor
We still gotta run from the law
Lick shots for the rich
I-95 moving them bricks
Lick shots for the crew
My niggas'll ride and I ride too

Someone lick a shot for D-Block cause that's what I'm on
Lick a shot for the niggas that ain't survive the storm
Lick a shot for all my niggas on the run
And lick a shot for all my real niggas that got bodies on they gun
Lick a shot for my niggas cause I know they'll do the same
For my niggas that run through the flames and walk through the rain
Lick a shot for all the niggas growing up in the slums
Blowing they spliffs with they razor blades under they tongue
Lick a shot for all my niggas that be banging they hammers
Sticking up stores, taking the tape out the video cameras
Lick a shot at all y'all haters whether smaller or bigger
Lick a shot cause Hood ain't never been scared to pull a trigger
Lick a shot for all my niggas that be pumping they crills
When the beef start cooking they be bustin' they steel
Lick a shot cause I ain't scared to
And lick a shot cause I'm prepared to
Crack a buckle with the matching hair due

[Chorus]

I lick shots for my niggas in jail
23 hours in the hole, on life parole
My jackmack niggas, octopus wildin'
Closest food they ever gettin' to is city island
I lick shots for C-E-O's that hit niggas off for weed and don't care if you bleed
Just mind they business and go the other way
For the right price they could get you the yay
I lick shots for my thug ass niggas that'll put something in you
From they car and hit your face through the diner menu
Your body get numb, you swallow your tongue
Cough up blood, that's the work I do, what
I lick shots for my niggas that's not on tour
And gotta hustle to eat its the motherfuckin' way of the streets
Pay attention

[Chorus]

Lick shots for the little babies in the projects
Running around unsupervised with sharp objects
Lick shots for papi that give you the yay half price
And niggas that ain't ever been heard but they mad nice
Nobody tell when I squeeze at your men
Lick shots when your diesels at ten, I'ma see you again
Lick shots cause my record is clean
Middle of the street, broad day lettin' it scream
If I'm lucky they'll squirt through your back
And after that I'll make sure I lick shots for the purple and yack
Lick shots just to guard your grill
To my nigga T and Green and my uncle and Arthur Kill
Lick shots for the S-L 6
Cherry red with them chrome things on it with the x-l lips
Lick shots for the niggas who got shot and ain't here
They say life goes on but it ain't fair

[Chorus: x2]",Lick Shots,2002
Sheek Louch,"[DMX]
Uhh (huh) yeah, it is what it is
Yah mean? We untouchable baby

[Chorus]
I keep my song in my soul
Blessed my heart and made it go
Tops of our heads to tips of our toes
We're untouchable
Everyday the sun'll shine
Took this dream and made it mine
I'm gettin down one thing that I know (WHAT!)
We're untouchable

We built this Double are thing from the ground up
Another principle of when it's beef, niggaz round up
Gettin' down like what nigga, YO!
That's all it takes and it's like, HERE WE GO!

Thorough type niggaz that control the streets
Rollin deep, holdin' heat, don't even think about sleep
When we creep, niggaz goin' down for the count
It ain't sweet, fuck around and knock money out

Come on fella, you don't want the dog with the camp
Not Old Yeller, a pitbull and dog is the champ
You know better, think about crossin' the line
Hit your sweater, with about ten from the .9

Double are and we get down for life!
Let a nigga KNOW we can go down tonight
From the tops of our heads, the tips of our toes
What! We untouchable, alright?
Yea, WHAT!

[Chorus]

Yeah, yeah, YEAH! Be strong..

I represent the have and the have-nots
All the niggaz with the weed spots
And all my niggaz on them cell blocks
We goin' are-you-double-F are-why-D-E

You can't fuck with my army
My niggaz is untouchable, eatin' niggaz like Lunchable
.45 be crushin' you when the bullets be touchin' you
Paul bearers'll carry you

To the cemetery where your momma goin' bury you
Black suit be fittin' you nigga, I got hood degrees
Plus I'm street like powder, milk, and government cheese
If you a runnin' man nigga, then I'ma shoot up your knees

Then it's me against the world, man against machine
S.D.T.S. - stick to my routine
My knuckle game impeccable, crack game incredible
Lawyers for my niggaz who be sittin' in the Federal
Nigga, I'm untouchable

[Chorus]

Lyrically I'm, untouchable..
Infa-Red nigga, let's go..

All I can know is 365 days of pain
My name, how to sell cocaine
And I was taught to buy guns so big when I go to the roof
I can aim and shoot down a plane

Infa-Red's my name but fuck all that
Fall back and witness how the streets made me the grimiest nigga alive
I sell you a fake pie, shoot out your fake eye
Give niggaz a break, nah; I gotta chase mine

Don't wear your watch around me nigga I take time
Like niggaz that them blue tried to like
I turn men to mice, canary yellow my ice
And Ruff Ryde on anybody, to be precise

But I handle my business like I'm supposed to
When you go in the precinct, that's the only time you see my poster
But I could post up and get rid of my pieces
I own collies sellin' rocks the size of Domino pizzas

I'm untouchable, nigga

[Chorus]

Double R.. whoo! All day..
Yo, aiyyo X let me get 'em daddy - yo, yo, yo

U-N-T-O-U-C-H, A-B-L-E-S
Sheek the new Elliott Ness (no doubt)
Nigga, Bloodline, D-Block; two of the best
Hang the Double are chain from the side of the car

Drive by and put your brains on the side of the bar
Sheek heavy in the hood (uh-huh)
And I don't mean cause I gained weight in the hood (nah)
My aim is good, aiyyo X what they want it to be here?

Our hammer's cocked, outside of the house on the lawn chair
Yeah nigga what? The new rap LeBron's here
Get 'em dog, we the new America's nightmare
And we don't say much, we just get it on

That's why we don't get touched, y'all like a dutch
Hands all on you, I'm tryna warn you
to stay in your place, so you don't get laced
And them pretty ass shades, can stay on your face

[Chorus]

[Drag-On]
Uhh, uhh, uhh, come on!
You motherfuckers got me back on my grizzly, I'm back on the grind
I'm back to the streets, catch a beef, come back with the nine
I'll murder ya man, come back with his shines

I tote two guns, I don't care if you box, I don't care if you blind
I spit in your eye like niggaz is eatin, I'm splittin the pies
Frank Nitty your rap, how gritty am I? The city is mine
Yeah, you get in my way I pity your moms

Yeah, my block is real, my niggaz is armed
My borough is thorough, we bang with each other
I'm switchin' my diamonds and changin' the color
with change of weather, canary in the sun, uhh

I bury ya nigga then bury the gun, X what up?
Me and you is untouchable (uh-huh)
We both had bricks they couldn't sniff cause the coke was uncrushable
Guns is fingerprint-proof, we ""Ryde or Die""
You drivin by, we clap at your ride, good-bye

Yo, I'm just too much, I flow too sick 
I be on top of the snare, all over the kick 
Since a young cat, I been one wit the drum tap 
The purple start pushin' my lungs back 
Been there, done that 
My words stick to you like thumb tacks 
Pardon me, LOX hooked up wit Rodney 
The Ferrari's teal, but the truck's mahogany 
Hating, I can't get you bastards off me 
Fresh like I just took the plastic off me 
Me and streets is high school sweethearts 
And I'm always in her so she can't divorce me 
Can't see farther than Kiss, I'm like a father to this 
Want ya go and cop your father to this 
I possess the whole package - the girls, the thongs 
And there's something about me the world just loves

Hold the heat when I spit, need ten ice trays 
D-Block what up? What's fucking wit that? 
Got the Camp spitting heavy on this Jerkins track 
Glock jerk him back, either that or the mac 
I prefer chrome but take it if you got it in black 
Thick shorty want to hop on it 
I tell her not here, but we could go inside the bathroom 'Honey 
Let me give it to your straight, I ain't spending no money 
We could drink till we pass out, make dicks and all that 
I'm a gangster, I bet shorty crawl back 
Got her job through a two way contact

A toast to the death of my foes, respect violence, the criminal codes

Leave him dumb, deaf and blind, I ride on rinses

Started getting older, still lovin your style
How you dressed, how you drove the whole 80's wild
I was proud when you first got on MTV (ooh)
You was in the video chillin with Run-DMC
That's my girl (that's my girl)
Little nigga fiendin to hit it
Knowin one day in the future I'd be right up in it
Started doin talent shows, I had it off the hook
You was there but you was too big, you wouldn't even look
I ain't mad you ain't noticed til I got with a group
But even then it wasn't nothin 'less I got in the coupe (Damn)

I stopped givin you the attention I originally planned
Then you stopped fuckin wit me (oh)
And left me alone
And people only seen you with Jada and P (That's my mans)
You even went around town and started doggin me bad (Damn)
But it was my fault ya know, I couldn't even get mad (Ok)
Had to grab the pen and pad and get right back
Write some more poems to your ass and get back on track (Whoo)
I ain't go no problems telling you I love you to death
And that I'm whipped
And my shit'll be blown if you skip
Let's go

(Chorus)
A'yo I had to hit the streets, they said you be out there a lot
And I can find you around any nigga out that's hot
Every club, every whip, every gambling spot
You know you'd rather be with me, you like to bug out
Love to bring the thug out
Plus I be keeping it tight
We even go to work together, let you play all night
Mad loud while I sit and I write
Haha
We gon' see the world together
But not on cable
All your friends lovin me, you even got me a label
Got the magazines lovin our relations
People love to hear us talk, DJ's record our conversations
You good around other people, 'specially kids
You make them happy, even brothers doin their bids
And I ain't jealous at all (uh uh), go out and spread your wings
And you can hang with Pop, just pick up the phone when it rings
Let's go

I ain't gon' lie to why'all, I'm whipped (whoo)
(Chorus)
(How I love you)
(How I love you)
(How I cry)
(How I love you)",3-5-4 Tarrentino,2003
Sheek Louch,"I don't know
Maybe we can make a change, maybe not

I'm tired of crying, I'm tired of living
I'm tired of niggaz, I'm tired of women
Just want to be myself
Keep the fame, keep the wealth, give me my health
Take me to a place where they a'int hating no more
Where I don't gotta raise the hammer and clap the four
Where I don't gotta kick your door and ask for more
Where I don't gotta dig your floor and ask for more, whoa
Where I don't gotta serve no heads, cook no coke
And there's no such thing as feds
And there's no such thing as AIDS
And little kids live the age to walk the stage
No little babies crying, mama a'int dying
Papa live at home, he got a steady job
Everybody fall, he don't gotta rob

[CHORUS]
Walk with me talk with me
Some times I just sit and think
You know it's hard to express it why'all
That's why I put it all in ink

Where we ain't black or white
Matter fact we are, but we don't have to fight, or kill
Maybe Malcom would have been alive still
Maybe Martin would have been able to chill
Maybe a black face on a dollar bill
I keep hope alive, that I stay alive
I think it's coming, I try not to drink and drive
A place where the death penalty is gone
No abortions, life only lives on
Nobody getting shot for their chains
And no hard labor jobs, we all using our brains
And you don't have to strip through school
Cover your body mama, everything is cool
Let you daughter know here moms is smart
And that's your heart, before you tear her apart
I think I'm asking for too much man

[CHORUS]
No murders on the 5 o'clock news
No bodies over Jordan tennis shoes
Nobody laying on me, waiting to blast
I feel the spirits of my niggaz that past
It's like they right here, I just can't see them
Sometimes I'm jealous of them, damn I want to be them
Everybody fake, when will this ever end
If you don't know your enemy, the you don't know your friend
A place where there's no more wars, no more tears, no more liquor, no more beers
No more stocks, no more shares, no more fights, no more jails, no more kites
A place where you don't value money, just the air you breathe
And every day is sunny
I know it can never happen and it's just rappin
And I'm dreamin, again

A'yo hold up man, let me take why'all back to the beginning
Let why'all know what happend that night, listen
I don't even know these niggaz hangin in front
Usually we woulda been asked them what do they want
What they came here for, this is 354
What you tryna get some gas or some shit from the store
But nobody asked these motherfuckers what do they want
It was bitin, mad traffic, the first of the month
It was me, Chep, Bizzy and Hit
B.G. and Lickalone and yeah I think Earth was there and shit
And a few other niggaz in and out of the buildin
Tryin to catch every sell but not to children
Got a sixty of that yack in the store in the back
Chep about to go home and get more of his pack
Jake ain't fuckin wit us, what's the miracle
Niggaz moms ex heads now turn spiritual
want to preach to us talk about Christ
And how fuck sand, how he could bring the beach to us
That's when I noticed niggaz still outside
Hoody on with some shades like they tryna hide
So I cocked the hammer then I walked to 'em
No beef, just a friendly little talk to 'em
Listen

And they got blood on they hands while they drinkin a beer
They just robbed Dread and them niggaz spot

That's when four shots let off, a black truck sped off
Big shit, tryna take a motherfuckin head off
Bombaclot, no man rob me spot, everybody here feelin me glock
They done put us in a mix now we gotta go to war with
Dread and them niggaz cause they think we wit these dicks
Shots goin everywhere, everybody clappin but them niggaz that was standin there
They fuckin disappeared
I cut one yardy underneath his fuckin beard
Still clappin, got everybody runnin scared
They ain't backin down and we ain't bitchin
Niggaz comin out the house with the hitchelin under the michelin
Throwin back a clip or two
You would think we went to war with Colin Powells crew
Police comin now but we don't give a fuck
Rhas' tryna grab all his niggaz in the truck
That's what I get for lettin niggaz blend in
And they ain't really wit us, niggaz really tryna get us
I keep my glock not givin a fuck
But the bullshit is we still gotta watch for that truck

Jadakiss dropped a solo they lovin' his voice
I'm lovin' his shit but the hood thought it was moist
Styles P dropped Gangsta and a Gentleman
Hard, no need to speak but the promotion was weak
Sheek never had solo plans
Till I dropped a freestyle in the studio with some a my mans
Lobson tweaked that, Mario leaked that
Your shit hot you could bring the muhfuckin streets back
Nah, I dunno I'm just tryin' get a label
Sit behind the desk you know, watch a lil' cable
Put my lil' man out, throw a few grand out
Get into some pop music, put a rock band out
Got wit my nigga K, cool and Whop
Green Lantern had my shit on the block (Hold me down)

Lotta assuming a niggas' salary
More lies than truth definitely more rumors than reality
Only way you beating a body is a technicality
Other than that catch 'em in Clinton on the gallery
The determination and dedication and discipline
Listening and catching the jewels that you was missing
And they still doing coward shit
You know the hate is gonna always be heavy but the love overpowers it

Said she won't, be back
'Til we get e-ven (what'chu mean get even)
Said she gon' take, my kids

I know she try to be there for me
It's fucked up I got caught cheat-in

Aiyyo, I ain't gon' lie, I got weeded all drunk and I cheated
After the club, shorty gave me what I needed (yeah)
That freaky side in the back of a ride
In the back of the park, where we used to hide (oh)
First it was a fling cause I kept her in the wing
She knew I had a wife cause I kept her on my ring
But she ain't even care, she just wanted to be down
And come around the lab when I lay a song down (right on mami)
And even when I seen her with my lady
She'll walk by, I'll walk by, no actin shady
No prank calls, no baby momma brawls (none of that)
Real grown lady like, up in the malls
This whole thing is like way too good
You almost never catch a shorty like that up in the hood (uh-uh)
So I kept it on the hush (yeah) brought me a bat line
And called shorty up when it was time to crush

Could be just lookin at the picture, she don't gotta ask

I remember when she first flew first class (calm down)
I let her push the whip in, until she started flippin
Axin me am I messin with some other chicken
I'm like ""WHOA, baby NO NO NO""
This ain't gon' start (uh-uh) and please be smart
You know I got a girl, what'chu care what I do

Sheek Louch,"Hit him up two times
Three'd be hat trick
Gave him more shots than the pediatrics
Came to his house and shot his left hand out
Left him with more scars than Mr. Def Jam South
To reach the sky, how far would a star go
To handle more cigars than a Cuban cargo
Makin money from everything I spoke in this
Wrapped by more ice than a broken wrist
Got ability to make missy a little tipsy
I'm more P.I.M.P than Mississippi (git it? Uh!)

I know you like to show off you're bust in gowns
'cause you go around jugglin guys nuts around
And we don't gotta wait till you're ass confesses
'cause you go around showing off you're ass in dresses
You watchin porn sittin there at you're macintosh
With you're hand in you're ass like you're jackin off
And you try goin harder than star wars Anakin
'cause you practice at you're house with a anus manikin

got a belt full of steel you can call me santa
You better keep your eyes peeled like a fuckin banana
And don't try to shoot me like some dumb retards
'cause I miss bullets like I'm sendin them e-cards 
Always equipped with the vest so don't aim for the bell-ay
'cause I dodge bullets like I play for LA
And I'm invisible 'cause you can't even see me son
But you're soft as shit I could shoot you with a bb gun
They call me stretch where I'm from 'cause I'm extended out
Find your ass in my house and I'll send it out
I got a custom made gun so the cops link my shot

And I hate rats so I dugg a ditch for myself, what

With my hand up on my heater, and my killaz on churp
You see me one deep in the spot, think I'm slippin', try ya luck
'Cause I got sixteen homeys with me, that stay ready to buck
You can duck dodge or dive, but it won't do diddley squat
But leave ya with a leaky liver and both ya kidneys shot
But you may not pimpin' I ain't fin to ask for it
My money, my hood or my respect, I'm a blast for it
You can't push fast forward, rewind or pause
I'm a beat you till you shittin' ya draws, so call the laws cause

Man you can watch that tour bus go by

But now I'm here and I'm the same 
And once I tried to let it go 
But its so impossible I just don't know

And once again I've let it go

Which part you wan' lose?
The clip is loaded, the quatro is on cruise
I'm back to work bitch, the clock off snooze
I'm tougher than leather nigga I cannot bruise
Who wanna try a nigga?
Hard to the God, come and butterfly a nigga (hold that!)
Ooze on out (uh-huh)
Weeks later bitch go and throw your shoes on out
I'm that shit that great Mario {?} 'bout
Clear this out, blood on the hopscotch floor
Shells in the sandbox; niggaz with big glocks
Late night, movin' that junk, like Redd Foxx
Now, you don't want nothin' about me (nah)
You pussy, nigga come fuck with the alkie
Weed smokin', keep the cancer piece on it (yeah!)
Call hoes, get pussy whenever I want it (c'mere bitch)
Mack daddy (no) pimp daddy (no)
Hammer cocked (yeah) let that, go
I ain't heard shit in a long long time
To even fuck around with either one of my rhymes (Sheek Louch!)
Niggaz still livin' off the petty-ass crimes
The Hossa{?} hater, Lacoste gator
Levi's, hundred to the Mr. Chow waiter
Whattup street niggaz? Hold heat niggaz
Fuck sweet niggaz, you'll get beat niggaz (yeah!)

[Chorus]
Now who out there wanna fuck around with me?
You can come and get a fresh buck-fifty
We got guns, money, liquor, drugs
We right here until they come get me (I'm talkin' 'bout murder)
Now who out there wanna fuck around with me?
You can come and get a fresh buck-fifty
We got guns, money, liquor, drugs
We right here until they come get me

C'mon, yeah, ah-hah! Nobody, c'mon
Yeah, c'mon, yeah, c'mon, yeah, yeah, uhh, yo

Yo listen here, you ain't dead if your heart ain't stop
Twin forty's, you ain't gotta ask ""Are they cocked?""
I'm so sharp I could come through and scar they block
Late night, red linin' in an R.A. drop
And I'm only tuckin' them until I shoot ya
When I pull 'em out that's when I'm fuckin' with your future
You gon' realize this is nothin' that you're used to
Get your life tooken by a booster, then we gon' hang the noose up
It's all over with (yeah)
All they found was his Louis scarf with his DNA all over it (mm)
Who's choosin' and pickin' them (who?)
Cause I'm sick of them, not followin' the curriculum (yeah)
It's my shit and I'm evictin' them (get out)
Whoever feel like they ain't gotta leave, I'm rippin' them
Even though the love's frail the thug's real
All you gotta do is just follow the blood trail
Much harder fightin' when the battle is uphill
Whatever the knife can't handle the slug will
Keep a good lawyer that's smart work on cases
Still gotta run from the NARCs, they gon' chase us (run)
In case I gotta put some artwork on faces
If we leave the game for God they gon' 'Mase' us
My suggestion, is that you don't even test son
Unless you wanna catch a fresh one

A little zif and dale, a little ace of spade
I'ma roll the purple up, let you taste the haze
You know I gotta thug it, Olympic size swimming pool
With the mosaic towels at the bottom of it
You could spin and keep spinning, I ain't got a budget

Just noticed the color car that you're shopping with
Take pride in the joint when you're mopping it
Kiss melts in your mouth like chocolate
Make sure it's hot whenever you're dropping it
Right now we got billionaire guap to get
You ain't in the boys club, you just copped the fifth

",Rocking with the Best,2009
Sheek Louch,"I just wanna thank y'all for takin' the time to listen
I appreciate that

Yo, regular TV to cable from bouncin' label to label
Just tryin' to get the horse outta the stable
Was once part of a dynasty, well, least I was tryin' to be
Think it was the time in my life when I was findin' me

Sittin' in the spot with the dimes
Willin' to do anything just to be a Bad Boy at the time
Then I rolled the dices, nah, the money didn't add up
But just that whole experience, it was priceless

No free rides to the bank
On top of that was the untimely demise of Frank B.I.
Then the 'No Way Out' tour, we was smokin' outdoor
Made eighty stacks off Cee-Lo that without tour

Videotaped it all, I still watch it now
I traveled the world, learned how to rock a crowd
It ain't much but it beats poor things that I've been through
Is all I can speak for

I can only speak for the things that I've been through
I can only speak for the things that I've been through

Now I'm on Ruff Ryder, Interscope
Same shit partnership, joint venture fifty, fifty, same split
Jimmy put the money up, two singles off of 'We Are The Streets'
Then after that seemed like he was done with us but it wasn't over yet

Styles had a plan from the jump
Which was to come out with my solo
Next thing's a little better
These the niggas that I been doin' it wit forever
Next, so I'm like whatever

The first album dropped, promotion was hella
Every stage I rocked, the performance was stella
Had the whole world ready to ride or die for me
And I wasn't platinum, I was just side money

X was bringin' in the moollah
I was in the hood in the kitchen wit the digital ruler
I can't tell you 'bout the evil men do
I can only speak for the things that I've been through

I can only speak for the things that I've been through
I can only speak for the things that I've been through

As far as the LOX, we all fine, cellar is all wine
Selfish for me to say Rocfella is all mine
'Cause it ain't , I'm just a another employee that's on line
Tryin' to get my act together and do it one more time

Twenty one guns salute with all nines
And I know it's on me to make sure that we all shine
Gotta fall back, let the weed contact your mind
Confined bullshit in any contract you sign

But if you from the streets though, it's plenty of loop holes to eat yo'
Once they let you in you're supposed to keep doe
But I can't give you the formula, I'm on it though
Expect the worst, the outcome is enormous, though

Stay humble, still keep your heat for insurance though
Things that I been through to get it weren't normal yo'
Yeah, this is what my heart beats for
Things that I've been through is all that I can speak for

I can only speak for the things that I've been through
I can only speak for the things that I've been through

But I ain't mad at you paps, you're still my nigger

Had flash backs, homies getting killed, blood getting spilled
Jails getting billed, shit's twisted, real statistic

On the cell with the boat

Fuck the jailhouse, Hennessey on the rocks

Cristal pourer, be glad we ain't takin' yours
Boring huh? I'm warnin' ya
Style waits for no bitch, I dream rich
When I fuck with scratch and sniff
Now I stacks the shit, and practice it
So no bitch can tax the shit, miraculous
So I can relax a bit, and get my dick licked
Drugs, baby
Haha

Need a little something that can take me there
To a place that I can get away from
My feelings so far away
Somewhere with my head up in the clouds
Suddenly it doesn't feel so loud
So far, away, somewhere

I got 'em
Ayo, platinum choker, heavy smoker
The gun toter, Barrack Obam' supporter
Recently Hillary voter
Smoking loud way up in the cloud
Disappearing in my thoughts
Disappearing from courts
Yao Ming face, eyes chinky
Kush got my breath stinky
50 thousand large shine on my pinky
Women lust me, they say I'm too ghetto
They can't trust me, my timeline be filled with his bitch
He wanna bust me, Mira Mira talk
Coca Cola deals, big scales
Doing different shit, Alaska
SnapChatting at Wheels Donnie
My prognosis is atrocious out the black wraith
Fly shit, never down, I stay with some faith
Ahh

Dreamt of Ferraris and Ferragamos
Raised on the streets, and married the marijuana
Told the joint terminate my thoughts like Sarah Conner
But it couldn't, but I smoked with Big, a badge of honor
And Faith, what's fate?
Light and 8th and I'm straight
That's the morning
But I'mma need a zip when it's late
I used to sit on the crate
But now I dip in the seats
Of the Cherokee
The therapy's a spliff to the face (huh?)
I'm from the strain gang and the mean team
Cut the lights, turn the beat on, let the pain bang
Light the joint, the escape route
You heard it from the Ghost
But you should it hear it from Faith now

Need a little something that can take me there
To a place that I can get away from
My feelings so far away

What can I say?
It was an accident
I never dreamed we'd meet again this way
You're looking well
I'm not afraid
You have a lovely home
Just like a picture
No, I live alone
I found it easier
You must remember how I never liked
The party life

Fix the heater, getting old

Que tal os va
Como explicarles
Que ya no sé ni dónde estas

Por que me tienen
Que hablar de tí
Como decirles
Que te quiero olvidar

Todo me recuerda a tí
Tu sombra sigue aquí
Pues cada paso que doy
Cada historia de amor
Todo, todo me recuerda a tí

Tú me enseñaste
A comprender y aceptar
Que de amor nadie muere
Que es fácil olvidar

Refugiarme en él
Pero cierro los ojos
Y te siento en su piel

Todo me recuerda a tí
Tu sombra sigue aquí

Sheena Easton,"Darker grows the moon, and shadows steal across the prison of my room
I fight the sleep back from my eyes
I know I'll only be alone when I rise, I'll only be alone when I rise

Candles flicker out, the curtains flutter and a chill is all about
I keep reliving yesterday, time won't make my memories fade away
My memories won't fade away

[Chorus]
When life was just a carousel, a penny in a wishing well
A heavy-lidded summer night under the stars
Our pleasures were so easy then, I never gave a thought to when 
We'd come apart, victims of floating hearts

Love was in the air, and I believed there'd always be enough to share
I never felt the winds of change, your love for me so suddenly blown away
Your love for me has flown, flown away

We'd come apart, victims of floating hearts
We'd come apart, victims of floating hearts...",Floating Hearts,1987
Sheena Easton,"Let me be the first to say, ain't it always so
But there's no other way to find out what I need to know
It's not that I don't think you care, it's what you haven't said
That keeps me guessing day and night, putting visions in my head

[Chorus:]
Don't let me be the last - if you thought of leaving would you tell me
Don't let me be the last - if the truth would hurt me would you lie to me
(What would you say)
Don't you keep it to yourself for my protection, break it to me now
Don't let me be the last - if there's anything you want to tell me
Don't let me be the last - like you're never gonna let me go
Honey, all I ask, don't let me be the last to know
You know how a friend will talk, a secret's hard to keep
And this girl he says you're in love with, sounds a lot like me
Still it's not for me to say if what I heard is true
And I won't let myself believe a word, till I hear it from you

[Chorus:] repeats out",The Last to Know,1987
Sheena Easton,"I don't think I've ever felt like this
I don't think I've ever known so much happiness
I never had one touch change so much, and oh what a feeling
This time, I'm sure that heaven must have sent you from above
'Cause I get butterflies when you whisper sweet love
No other heart will do, oh it's only you
 
[Chorus:]
You take my breath away, every time you hold me, I want to say I love you
My cup is to the top, and emotions overflowing
Baby this ain't no ordinary love, this ain't no ordinary love
My love, you've given new meaning to romance and my world
Would never be the same again, no more tears in the rain
No more hidden inhibitions

It's a brand new day and it's filled with your magic
We both know that it's real and what we feel inside
No mountain's too high to climb, no river can divide
After all is said and done you're the one, I'm already gone

I know nothing is guaranteed, but I'll take my chances
There's no need to worry, this is not ordinary love

Sheena Easton,"You hold me like a flower, afraid that I won't last
Then you touch me like I'm glass
But I don't shatter all that easily, if I cry it's not for me
What you see are sweeter tears, they fall


[Chorus:]
I hear no sound but a heart, beating softer every breath
Growing stronger every touch, I listen for the love
And hear no sound but a heart, thunder through the shadow room
When I lie with you and listen to the love
No need to hurry now, love takes the time it needs, it opens from a seed
To tangle two of us in twisting vines, passion grows like roses climb
Praying that the morning sun won't rise

[Chorus:]
Say no words, I can hear your beating heart, that's all I need to know
So say no words
But I don't shatter all that easily, if I cry it's not for me
What you see are sweeter tears, they fall

[Chorus:]
No sound but a heart, no sound but a heart
I hear no sound but a heart - beating softer every breath

No sound, no sound...",No Sound But a Heart,1987
Sheena Easton,"You do your upper west side promenade in your latest masquerade now
There's always someone who's fall for your line

You got a rabbit in your tophat, so tell me baby, where your head's at now

Sheena Easton,"The last time I took a chance on love, I gave it all I had
And still it ended with a broken heart
And I vowed I'd never fall again, 'cause I couldn't stand the pain
Of losin' someone I cared for, I'd be torn apart forever
Then came you, and I got that feeling again
Oh, I'm still willing to try love
What can I do when the road leads back to you
Still willing to try love, you are the reason I share this heart again
Somehow, the tears were not enough
I tried to put the pieces back together again, start all over
But you were a blessing in disguise
'Cause now I look into your eyes and all my fears are gone
What a feelin', oh darlin', I want you to know, I'm leaving it all up to you
Oh, I'm still willing to try love
Oh what can I do, all the roads lead back to you
I'm willing to try love, you're the reason I share this heart again

Sheena Easton,"You don't give a show of public affection
How do I know if there's still an attraction

Only when he gives me, makes me feel alright

There must be ninety nine around my bed, around my bed
Lying awake all night long tears in vain
Sometimes I think that I'd be better off dead
Being without you is murder baby
Get in a taxi, subway train
Don't make me cry these tears in vain, baby
A hundred nights without you is murder baby
A 101 just won't do, no!
Why do I cry for you - you probably found someone new
And no one deserves ya, I say, no one deserves ya like I do
Baby you know it's true
Oooh - what we had you said was meant to be
If that was true tell me why'd you leave
Baby, I want to know
I'm sick of, I'm sick of, I'm sick of
Crying these tears in vain baby
Why don't cha get in a taxi, subway train
I'm going mad baby
I'm going insane baby don't cha know
101 just won't do - no, no listen
Nothing on TV, my girlfriends bore me
They try to please me but I need you baby
You and me need to be together, together physically
Why can't you come see about me?
Why can't you come see about me?
You've got to get in a taxi, subway train
Don't make me cry these tears in vain, baby
A hundred nights without you is murder baby
A 101 just won't do, no!

In a world where precious things are disappearing over night
Just keep my star in sight

Feelin' all alone, but I'll be close at hand
And every time you see a rainbow
Paint the sky behind the rain
You'll be here again

she asked about you
I didn't quite know what to say
heard you've been making the rounds
'round here
while i've been trying to make tears disappear......

Now i'm almost over you
i've almost shook these blues
so when you come back around
after painting the town, you'll see
i'm almost over you........

You're such a sly one with your cold, cold heart
maybe leaving came easy
but it tore me apart
time heals all wounds, they say
and I should know
'cause it seems like forever
but i'm letting you go.....

Now i'm almost over you
i've almost shook these blues
so when you come back around

all those shattered dreams
although you've left me with nothing to show
full of misery....

Do you try to find the feeling, that should never go away
Can it really be so easy, just to make the feeling stay

But when you hold me tight, oh, I know why you're doing it
Cause love can't be denied, when you prove it, do it for love

Do you, do you, do you, do you, do you do it for love?

Is it really love that you're feeling
Or just another pleasure you can't explain

Will you follow your own footsteps, baby let your heartbeat show you the way

But when you hold me tight, oh, I know why you're doing it

No more his eager call
The writing's on the wall
The dreams you dreamed
Have all gone astray

The man that won you
Has run off and undone you
That great beginning
Has seen a final inning
I don't know what happened
It's all a crazy game

No more that all-time thrill
'Cause you've been through the mill
And never a new love
Will be the same

But fools will be fools
And where's he gone to?

Lonelier and tougher
With hope you burn up
Tomorrow he may turn up
There's just no letup
The livelong night and day

Ever since this world began
There is nothing sadder than
A one-man woman
Looking for the man that got away

",The Man That Got Away,1993
Sheena Easton,"When days are long and nights are lonely
And all my daydreams have gone astray
I think about the one and only
Who's bound to find me some golden day

The one I love is coming along some day
And I'll have none except the one I love
He/She may be near or ever so far away
But I'll have none except the one I love

And though our meeting is left to chance
Until our meeting 
I still will have my dream romance
And through the night I pray to the moon above
To please be kind and find the one I love",The One I Love (Belongs to Somebody Else),1993
Sheena Easton,"There's a saying old says that love is blind
Still were often told, seek and ye shall find
So I'm going to seek a certain lad I've had in mind
Looking everywhere, haven't found him yet

Hes the big affair I cannot forget
Only man I ever think of with regret
I'd like to add his initial to my monogram
Tell me, where is the shepherd for this lost lamb?

There's a somebody I'm longing to see
I hope that he turns out to be
Someone who'll watch over me
I'm a little lamb who's lost in the wood
I know I could always be good
Someone who'll watch over me

Although he may not be the man some
Girls think of as handsome
To my heart he carries the key
Won't you tell him please to put on some speed
Follow my lead, oh, how I need
Someone to watch over me",Someone to Watch over Me,1993
Sheena Easton,"Here we are folks

Do you believe, do you believe in the magic of love

When there's no love in your life
Days feel long, you're all alone, 
And life waves you bye-bye
You close the door to your heart

Don't want to let the pain in yet,
You're always on your guard
But when the love birds start to sing, 
You hear bells start to ring
And you feel it's happening, oh baby

[Chorus]

When there's no love in your home
You're on the street so incomplete, 
You're out on your own, oh
You'll meet some just along for the ride

But you know where they're coming from, 
Let your conscience be your guide
But when the day comes, the night goes, 
When your hate stops your love flows
Stimulation in an overload, oh baby

I feel the power of the hour,

Picture feelings that you can't control

Why don't you use your imagination
Nations go to war over women like you, 
it's just a form of appreciation

Come on over here, lay your clothes on the chair
Now let the lace fall across your shoulder
Standing in the half light, you're almost like her
So take it slow like your daddy told you""

Strut pout, put it out, that's what you want from women
Come on baby, what'cha taking me for
Strut pout, cut it out, all taking and no giving
Watch me baby while I walk out the door

I said, ""Honey, I don't like this game, 
you make me feel like a girl for hire
All this fascination with leather 
and lace is just the smoke from another fire""

before it reaches its destination
Lie down here beside me, oh, have some fun too
Don't turn away from your true vocation""

Absolue et sincère, ma vie est une prière qui s'élance vers toi
Oh ! chagrins, larmes et contraintes
Oh ! ne peuvent plus m'atteindre
Oh !

Tu es le soleil
L'astre de mes nuits
La providence 
Qui fait partie de ma vie
Oh ! qu'il pleuve, qu'il vente, qu'il neige
Oh ! ta présence me protège
Oh !

Tu es le soleil
L'astre de mes nuits
La providence qui fait partie de ma vie

Tu es le soleil, ma raison d'être
Mon unique défaite 
Ma plus belle victoire aussi

Tu es le soleil

La providence qui fait partie de ma vie

De te dire que tu pouvais bien t'en aller
Que je t'oublierai

Ce matin tu m'évites. J'ai si peur, ne m'abandonne pas
Imagine un seul jour loin de toi
Je ne le pourrais pas
Je me sens comme en prison
Quand je me retrouve seule à la maison
Sans aucun désir

De se raconter des tas d'histoires ça sert à rien
Et de faire semblant d'y croire ça sert à rien

Mais je t'aime plus que ma vie
J'ai attendu tant de nuits
En tremblant lorsque tu ne rentrais pas
Je suis là pour t'écouter et même pour te consoler
Quand tous tes rêves s'envolent en fumée
Aujourd'hui je m'accroche à ces mots ne m'abandonne pas
De te voir me quitter pour si peu, je ne te laisserai pas
Quelle est celle qui saura t'aimer davantage quand tu as mal ou froid
Quand tu n'en peux plus

De se raconter des tas d'histoires ça sert à rien
Et de faire semblant d'y croire ça sert à rien

A chaque tournant de notre vie
On s'en est toujours sorti
Comme un couple amoureux fou et complice
Tant de fois cette nuit je t'ai dit ne m'abandonne pas
Pour hier, pardonne-moi et laisse-moi me jeter dans tes bras

D'nous payer une p'tite sortie dehors

Sans prév'nir grand-père est arrivé
Et il n'aime que la télévision
Mais comme il faut tout lui expliquer
On est tous restés à la maison.

La famille ça fait partie
Des p'tits soucis quotidiens
Mais pourtant c'est une vie
Qu'on aime bien.

J'ai un frère qui est trop jeune encore
On n'aime pas le voir traîner la nuit
C'est pourquoi il me dit qu'il m'adore
Quand il veut que je sorte avec lui
Il m'entraîne en disant : ""sois gentille""
Mais à peine est-on dans l'escalier
Il avoue : ""je vais voir une fille
Laisse-moi seul et va de ton côté"".

La famille ça fait partie
Des p'tits soucis quotidiens
Mais pourtant c'est une vie
Qu'on aime bien.

Dans trois mois ce seront les vacances
Il faut bien choisir où l'on ira
C'est pour ça que longtemps à l'avance
On étale des cartes devant soi
On discute pendant des heures entières
On se fâche je me demande pourquoi
Puisque chaque année de toute manière
On s'retrouve toujours au même endroit.

La famille ça fait partie
Des p'tits soucis quotidiens
Mais pourtant c'est une vie
Qu'on aime bien.

Quand on est réunis tous ensemble
Des beaux-frères jusqu'aux petits cousins
Y a les murs de la maison qui tremblent
J'vous assure qu'on nous entend de loin
Mais si un étranger veut s'en mêler
Pour savoir qui a raison ou tort
Il nous voit bientôt réconciliés
Et tous unis pour le flanquer dehors

Mais pourtant c'est une vie

Avec de très jolies filles
En scope et en couleurs

Je me voyais
A Hawaï
Je me croyais
Au paradis

Il tenait tête aux bandits

Sheila Chandra,"Long afloat on shipless oceans
I did all my best to smile
'Til your singing eyes and fingers
Drew me loving to your isle
And you sang
Sail to me
Sail to me
Let me enfold you
Here I am
Here I am
Waiting to hold you

Did I dream you dreamed about me?
Were you here when I was forced out
Now my foolish boat is leaning
Broken lovelorn on your rocks
For you sing, ""Touch me not, touch me not, come back tomorrow
Oh my heart, Oh my heart shies from the sorrow""

Well I'm as puzzled as the newborn child
I'm as riddled as the tide
Should I stand amid the breakers?
Or should I lie with death, my bride?
Hear me sing, ""Swim to me, swim to me, let me enfold you
Here I am, here I am, waiting to hold you""",Song to the Siren,2001

That when you throw your love away,
You act as if you just don't care,
You look as if you're going somewhere.
But I just can't convince myself,
I couldn't live with no one else.
And I can only play that part,
And sit and nurse my broken heart.


So lonely, so lonely, so lonely.
So lonely, so lonely, so lonely.

For a thousand years or more,
All made up and no where to go,

Sheila E.,"The belle of St. Mark was a frail but a passionate creature
Ebony hair and eyes of deep blue-green
The belle of St. Mark wore clothes that belonged to his father
Even though he was only seventeen

I'm in love
With the belle of St. Mark
It tears me apart whenever I hear him cry
I'm in love
With the belle of St. Mark
And if he doesn't love me I think I'll probably die

You can tell from expressions that he makes public
That he suffers from a badly broken heart
He smiles as he feeds the afternoon pigeons
But he cries as he walks the night streets of St. Mark

I'm in love
With the belle of St. Mark
It tears me apart whenever I hear him cry
I'm in love
With the belle of St. Mark
And if he doesn't love me I think I'll probably die

The belle of St. Mark he don't talk to strangers
He's so mysterious
His erotic persuasion provokes me like no other man
The fire I have for him is undoubtedly serious

I must make him see that he needs love to forget
And if anyone can help him, I can
I can help
I can help you

His Paris hair blows in the warm Parisian air
It blows whenever his Paris hair is there
The woman who hurt him surely must have trouble sleeping
'Cause the belle of St. Mark is a beauty extraordinary

I'm in love
With the belle of St. Mark.
It tears me apart whenever I hear him cry
I'm in love
With the belle of St. Mark
And if he doesn't love me I think I'll probably die
I'm in love
With the belle of St. Mark.
It tears me apart whenever I hear him cry
I'm in love
With the belle of St. Mark
And if he doesn't love me I think I'll probably die

If he doesn't love me I think I'll probably die
If he doesn't I'll die",The Belle of St. Mark,1984

Can't you comprehend, I want a lover, not a friend?

If my bodily functions operate
This way when U just call my name
I'd hate 2 see when we are finally
Playing that nasty love game

Keep your fingers under control

sew and weep

Is falling for make-believe

Learning to trust is just
For children in school

To seek a kiss, not mine alone
To share a kiss that devil has known

Time and time again I went away
But then would come the time when I would need you

One look is all you'd need to see the mood I'm in.
Perhaps then you'd realize I'm still in love with you.

And trying awfully hard to make my tears behave
But that's quite impossible, I'm still in love with you.
 
You'll happen my way on some mem'rable day
And the month will be May for a while.
I'll try to smile but can I play the part

Those come what may places
Where one relaxes on the axis of the wheel of life

With distingue traces
That used to be there you could see where they'd been washed away
By too many through the day twelve o'clock tales

Then you came along with your siren song
To tempt me to madness
I thought for a while that your poignant smile
Was tinged with the sadness of a great love for me
Ah yes I was wrong, again I was wrong

Life is lonely again
And only last year everything seemed so sure
Now life is awful again
A trough full of hearts could only be a bore
A week in Paris could ease the bite of it
All I care is to smile in spite of it

I'll forget you, I will
While yet you are still burning inside my brain

So I'll live a lush life in some small dive
And there I'll be
While I rot

Sheila Jordan,"If you should decide to seek your special dream
Your heart's desire
Nothing you can ever do
Will bring more joy to you

And if you're wise you'll recognize
Your guiding theme
Your heart's desire
Follow that and you may make
Your dearest dream come true

But if you seek your heart's desire
Your heart may break
That's the risk your dreams require

The chance you take
The choice you make
And soon enough the seasons start to slip away
So seize the day and if the fates are kind
Then you may find your heart's desire

But if you seek your heart's desire
Your heart may break
That's the risk your dreams require

The chance you take

Spending my money, honey, I didn't care
Taking my friends out for a mighty good time
I drank that good gin, champagne and wine

Just as soon as my money got low
I couldn't find no friends and I had no place to go
If I ever get my hands on a dollar again
I'm gonna hold on to it till that eagle grins

'Cause I found out that nobody wants you
Nobody wants you when they find out
That you're down and out
In your pocket, there's not not one penny
And as for friends, you don't have any

Just let you get back up on your feet again
Here they all come telling you their your old long lost friend
And this I wanna tell you and about it I have no doubt
Nobody wants you, nobody needs you
Nobody wants when you're down and out

She still has the courage to scale her fears

Sheila Nicholls,"Medusa woke up one day and shaved her head
Well maybe now you'll let me a little closer she said
But she just sacrificed her identity instead

Be careful how you trend
Be careful how you tread

Medusa went home again and watched TV
A commercial for deodorant, tampons, so now we won't smell see
Said the sister with the plastic smile, excitement, and glee
Buy your shame for free
Buy your shame for free

And all the smiles that we spill
Because it's part of the drill
The shame that we bear
For the floors that aren't there
The unfulfilled will be dismissed
For a savior, a kiss
The memories we repress ... when we undress

She went channel surfing 
And all that was seen
Were decorative women arrive on the screen
Conventional images of adolescent male dreams
When men aren't around they fall apart at the seams
Passive exposed
Peaches and cream
Survive like an object to blow off your steam
Interchangeable fragments
And outlines and shapes
They say no they mean yes to little girl rapes

And all the smiles that we spill
Because it's part of the drill
The shame that we bear
For the floors that aren't there
The unfulfilled will we dismiss
For a savior, a kiss
The memories we repress ... when we undress

The rage trapped inside
Smothered and dried
The words that we use
They divide and abuse
The wound between women keeps the war-mongers grinning
The war between women stops recovery beginning

Medusa grew her hair back
Around her face
She'd been looking for alignment in the wrong place
So she called up her friends
Malcom x and collie 
And they go on a plane
Cocked off too ...

I don't want to hurt you
Reflex to old imprinting

Now I know I'm not what I said that I was
I just wanted this to be true
I'm not sure where I went
But you deserve someone more innocent

So unprotected

Is still searching in me

Will this human bowl ever be filled
When we're so distracted anyway
Talking about eating peanuts for another day

Appalled by what I see
As nothing less 
Than manufactured images of my happiness
Insults all over work
Humanity
And corporations dictate who's a slave
And who is free

Well they said
Desire would design the market
But if you have the money 
You can plant desire in peoples heads
And make them believe 
They need something that they don't
People buy an image before they buy their food
And if we keep selling based on people's insecurities
We'll just make them bigger
And perpetuate mass blindness

They're leaving the movie theater
He wants a Hercules happy meal 
He wants a T-shirt, the sneakers, and the sword
He's only four but he's learned to consume til he's bored
He's only four but he's learned to consume til he's bored

And I amuse myself by thinking about a day that I might see
Where every product that is sold reminded us to be
Where the external consumption is merely temporary

If you want real love,
Consume internally
If you want real love,
Consume internally
If you want real love,

Sheila Nicholls,"She looked for perfection in an imperfect world
Cause she needed perfection where his hatred was curled
And she tried to remember how heaven had felt
Cause she new that she had been there before these cards were dealt

(Chorus) And he's just a skeleton, no doubt in his eyes
And she is an angel no one denies
So she turned and she left him to turn night into day
But he grabbed hold of anything just to make her stay 

She searched for the lesson that would teach her the skills
To fill her hole with herself not Valium pills
But it's hard to find sisters not poisoned with doubt
Its hard to find sisters who still know what faith's all about

(Chorus)
Just to make her stay (bis 4)
She came to the table to play a new game
But she is still holding the same cards
But she won't feel your shame

There's nothing to fuel her along till herself she believes in

My breath in is your breath out, we begin
And for a moment lifting this
Deception of being separate from you

My breath in is your breath out
We walk in, into the ocean
Shifting my perception of being one drop of dew

We talked about God and the limbs on the floor
And the legalization of deviance
We thought then of sense and how often its veiled
And how the machines and their components have already failed

Delilah saw the yellow flowers before us,
Just in case you didn't know.
They rooted for me 'cause I wore their colors,
Told me not to linger, just grow.

And I'm glad us girls could get over Salem,
And not divide each other and not watch each other fall.

And I deliver what I want you to see,
Just like you have always done for me,
But his can never be a war.
The object of this game is to leave with equal score.

And Icarus shouted down from the clouds and the trees,

Be careful of the air,

Love's not the illusion of desire,
Still he tried to break their stare,
What choices will you make he said with failure in his smile.
I'm sure this beauty's fake, and I'm sure this love is vile.

As I had myself another espresso
So I asked that chick, would she care to swing
As I had myself another espresso
And she said, ""Baby, that's uh cool with me
But like I can't split until half past three
So why don't you just sit there and cool it and like wait for me
And maybe have yourself another espresso.""

Well I never cared much for formal dates
I just sit and have myself an espresso
Man ya know but when a chick is a groove like baby you've gotta wait
And maybe have yourself another espresso
So I took off my coat and I hung up my hat
And for the next five hours right there I sat
You know that chick went home with some other cat
And so I had myself another espresso

The moral of the story I will tell you then
As I have myself another espresso
Is always follow the ways of Zen
And maybe have yourself another espresso
And whenever the world has got you way uptight
Why baby you just sit there and cool it until everything's right
'Cause you know I met another chick that very night
And we uh we
Well we just sat around and had us an espresso",Have Another Espresso,1962
Shel Silverstein,"Well, for a long time now I’ve been aware
That like I’m alright but like the world is square.
So I’ll tell all you people you can take my tip
It does not pay to be hip.

Now just last week I found myself in the red
With no way to meet my overhead
So like I went to my buddy
And asked him for some bread,
And here is what he said:
He said, “You want white bread,
Rye bread, pumpernickel, whole wheat
Cracked wheat, challa or bialy?”
I said, “Later”.
He said, “You mean three or four o’clock?”
I said, “Later”.
He said, “You mean Thursday or Friday?”
I said, “Forget it”.

Now I was feelin uptight, so like I went to see the man.
I heard he always had some stuff on hand.
I said, “Tell me, baby, can you spare some pot?”
He said, “You’re welcome to anything I got.
And I’ve got steel pots, brass pots, cast iron, aluminum
Pyrex, Winbex.”
I said, “Cool it”.
He said, “You mean put it in the refrigerator?”
I said, “Cool it”.
He said, “You mean turn on the air conditioning?”
I said, “Forget it”.

Now I was feeling strung out
And hung up and brought down.
There was nobody hip like in the whole damn town.
So I run upon a chick, and she was long and tall
And asked her would she care to ball.
And she said, “Football, baseball, volleyball, or basketball,
Handball, pinball, bowling ball?”
I said, “You’re putting me on.”
She says, “On the train, on the plane,
On the bus or on the sidewalk?”

I said, “I wanna make it”.
She said, “Make what?”
I said, “A scene.”
I said, “I want to make a scene!”
She said, “Shakespeare, Clifford Odetts,
Arthur Miller or Pirandello?”
I said, “Forget it”.

She says, “you know what I’d like to do?”
I said, “No, what?”
And she said, “I’d like to make love to you”.
And I said, “Go, baby, go!”
And she left.",It Does Not Pay to Be Hip,1962

Shel Silverstein,"A long time ago, when the earth was still green,
There were more kinds of animals than you've ever seen;
They'd run around free while the earth was being born,
The loveliest of all was the Unicorn.

There was green alligators and long-necked geese,
Some humpty-backed camels and some chimpanzees,
Some cats and rats and elephants, but sure as you're born,
The loveliest of all was the Unicorn.

Now God seen some sinnin' and it gave Him pain.
And He said, ""Stand back, I'm going to make it rain.""
He said, ""Hey, brother Noah, I'll tell you what to do.
Build me a floating zoo.""

And take some of them green alligators and long-necked geese,
Some humpty-backed camels and some chimpanzees,
Some cats and rats and elephants, but sure as you're born,
Don't you forget my Unicorn.""

Old Noah was there to answer the call,
He finished up making the Ark just as the rain started fallin',
He marched in the animals two by two
And he called out as they went through,
""Hey, Lord: I've got yer....

Green alligators and long-necked geese,
Some humpty-backed camels and some chimpanzees,
Some cats and rats and elephants, but Lord, I'm so forlorn,
I just can't see no Unicorn.""

Old Noah looked out into the driving rain,
Them Unicorns was hiding, playing silly games,
Kicking and splashing while the rain was pouring,
Oh, them silly Unicorns.

There was green alligators and long-necked geese,
Some humpty-backed camels and some chimpanzees,
Noah cried, ""Close the doors 'cause the rain is pourin',
And we just can't wait for no Unicorns.""

The Ark started movin', it drifted with the tide,
Them Unicorns looked up from the rock and they cried,
And the waters came down and sorta floated them away,
That's why you'll never see a Unicorn, to this very day.

You'll see green alligators and long-necked geese,
Some humpty-backed camels and some chimpanzees,
Some cats and rats and elephants, but sure as you're born,
You're never gonna see no Unicorn.",The Unicorn,1962

He's comin' after Jinny wants to take her away but I ain't gonna let her go

Oh he boasted in town but she loved him he said she'd be his with the sun
He said anyone try to stop him would be just one more notch on his gun
They say that he's headstrong and handsome his hair's blowin' wild and free
And they got a hold I ain't comin' cause he's a lot younger than me
And he'll be comin' down the road...

He hasn't had much education he ain't worked a day in his life
He's livin' with some older woman they say she's another man's wife
But she wants him needs him and loves him she buys him his clothes and his meals
When she finds he's gone she'll be prayin' and Lord I know just how she feels
Because he's comin' down the road...

The sun's at his back as he's comin' the smile is cruel on his lip
His right hand is slowly descendin' to the sixgun that rest on his hip
Then his lower lip strated tremble and he started cryin' as he looked up at me
And I picked him up I said son you're only four years old
And you know Jinny's only three
So come on in the house and have some cookies and milk
And he did and the tears turned to smiles

Kick it again it's still breathing
Kick it again I think I seen it move just a little bitty
Kick it again it's still living
So kick it again and then again and then you'll kill my love for you

And the newspaper print, it's becoming quite small.

And the gals aren't half as pretty as I remember her.

So that I can win
My baby back again.

Yeah, I don't think I'll find her in the Okee Fenokee
'Cause the Okee Fenokee is too wet and smoky.
And I don't think I'll find her up in Mississippi.
She may be crazy but she ain't that lippy.
And she might-a seen her sister in Amarillo.
And she might-a gone to Philly just to see another fellah.
She might be drillin' oil in North Dakota.
Might-a gone to Iceland for an ice cream soda.

Shel Silverstein,"(Spoken Intro: When I was twelve years old I used to see the pictures of mermaids in all the books and magazines. Not mermaids but mermaids (pronounced MAREmaids), that's what we called them at home. And all the pictures, yeah, they never had no bras on, they didn't have anything on! And I was old enough that I knew that they didn't really exist, but, I also wondered, if they did exist, what the hell would you do with one if you caught it?!)

When I was a lad in a fishing town, an old man said to me,
""You can spend your life, your jolly life, a-sailing on the sea.
You can search the world for pretty girls 'til your eyes grow weak and dim,
But don't go swimmin' with a mermaid, son, if you don't know how to swim!
'Cause her hair is green as sea-weed,
Her lips are blue and pale.
I'll tell you now before you start,
You can love that girl with all your heart,
But you'll only love the upper part;
You will NOT like the tail!

I signed on to a whalin' ship, and my very first day at sea,
I spied a mermaid in the waves, a-reachin' out to me.
""Come live with me in the sea,"" said she, ""and down on the ocean's floor.
I'll show you a million wond'rous sights you've never seen before!""
So I jumped on in and she pulled me down, down to her seaweed bed.
A pillow she made of tortoise shells, and placed beneath my head.
She fed me shrimp and caviar from a silvery dish.
She was just my taste (down to her waist), but the rest of her was fish!
Her hair was green as seaweed.
Her lips were blue and pale.
Her face it was a work of art,
But I only gave her half my heart,
'Cause tho I loved the upper part,
I did NOT like the tail!

And then one day when I looked up, I saw a sailin' ship,
And I met the stare of a millionaire out on a fishing trip.
A diamond ring he tied on a string and lowered it down to her,
And my love divine, she went for the line and went for the usual lure!
So I sighed in the rolling tide, and I cried to the clams and the whales
How I missed her hair and her seagreen eyes; I missed the shine of her scales.
Just then her sister swam on by, and set my heart a-whirl --
For her upper part was an ugly old fish, but the bottom half was GIRL!
Her toes are round and rosey!
Her legs are slim and pale!
Her face might not be a work of art,
But I love that girl with all my heart.
And I don't give a damn about the upper part --
That's how I end my tale! ('Cause now I'm getting tail!)",Mermaid,1971

And though her daddy would scream and shout,
She simply would not take the garbage out.
And so it piled up to the ceilings:
Coffee grounds, potato peelings,
Brown bananas, rotten peas,
Chunks of sour cottage cheese.
It filled the can, it covered the floor,
It cracked the window and blocked the door
With bacon rinds and chicken bones,
Drippy ends of ice cream cones,
Prune pits, peach pits, orange peel,
Gloopy glumps of cold oatmeal,
Pizza crusts and withered greens,
Soggy beans and tangerines,
Crusts of black burned buttered toast,
Gristly bits of beefy roasts...

It raised the roof, it broke the wall 
Greasy napkins, cookie crumbs,
Globs of gooey bubble gum,
Cellophane from green baloney,
Rubbery blubbery macaroni,
Peanut butter, caked and dry,
Curdled milk and crusts of pie,
Moldy melons, dried-up mustard,
Eggshells mixed with lemon custard,
Cold French fries and rancid meat,
Yellow lumps of Cream of Wheat.

But don't stand there and block the door
I want a front row seat to hear ole Johnny sing.""

(chorus)

She said I'd have to go down to The Opry
And the feller there said I'd have to wait till Spring.
He said, ""We've been sold out for months and months
And this poor insane fellah wants
A front row seat to hear ole Johnny sing.""

Well, he said a couple more things, and I started cryin'
And then he laughed at me and that's when I started to swing.
Well I bust through the doors in a roaring rage,
Crawled over the crowd till I reached the stage
For a front row seat to hear ole Johnny sing.

(chrous)

Then some crazy guard started shootin'
I shot back, and the next thing I know I was winged
And on the floor
When a guy in a voice kinda deep and low
Says, ""Boy that's a mighty long way to go
For a front row seat to hear ANYBODY sing.""

And I guess that judge, he weren't no music lover.
I got fifteen months but that don't mean a thing.
'cause' yesterday in the prison yard
A show come through and HAR! de HAR!
I had a front row seat to hear ole Johnny sing.

I was sittin' in my basement I'd just rolled myself a taste of
Somethin' green and gold and glorious to get me through the day
When my friend yells through my transom grab your coat an' get your hat son
There's a nut down on the corner a givin' dollar bills away
But I sat around a bit and then I had another hit
And then I rolled myself a bomber thought about my momma
Looked around fooled around played around while and then

With the sweet face up to my place to fool around a bit

But when she asked me how I liked it Lord it hurt me to admit
I got stoned and I missed it

I ain't makin' no excuses for so many things I uses
Just to brighten my relationships and sweeten up my day

You better go look somewhere else,

She got off work at the foundry... she was feelin' kind of beat.
On the bus she had to stand and let some fella have her seat.
And she pinched the ass of a guy who passed her
Walkin' down the street.
When he called a cop, she didn't quite understand
So she stopped off on the corner for her usual shot of rye
When some guy lit her cigarette, she punched him in the eye.
Then he kicked her in the balls, it was enough to make her cry,
But she stood there and she took it like a man.

She's a liberated lady, and she smokes them big cigars.

They got into bed that evening, and she strapped her dildo on

Shel Silverstein,"There was Gemini Jim and Scorpio Sal

And everything was goin' fine
'Till into their life on a starless night

One eye yella and the other one gray,
Lookin' for a soul, but he won't get mine.
He's the man who got no sign.
Well he blew right in, sat right down
And rolled himself a righteous smoke.
He lit his roach with a lightnin' bolt,
He took a toke and spoke.
Said he was born in an astrological warp
When the moon refused to shine
On the cusp of nowhere and nevermore.
He's the man who got no sign.
Then he told a story of his endless search
To find his missing part,

And tries to do his chart.

Said, ""Man, you must be blind.
Your chick is lost 'cause her star is crossed
With the man who got no sign.""
Then late that night two shots rang out
From Jim's old .32.
He caught the stranger and Scorpio Sal
Doin' what they shouldn't do.
When we got to the shed, there was Jim by the bed,
Where Scorpio Sal lay dyin'.
But a blood-red stain is all that remained
Of the man who got no sign.
The arrest was made by Sheriff Slade,
An Aquarius through and through.
And the jailer was a Sagittarius.
She he beat Jim black and blue.
Then they dragged him up the courthouse steps.
They said, ""Jim how do you plea?""
He said, ""Man, the moon's in Virgo
So the blame don't fall on me.""
The jury all was Libras,
So you know they was more than fair.
But his lawyer was an Aries,
And an Aries just don't care.
The judge he was a Cancer,
And Cancers have no friends.
But the hangman was a Taurus,
And that's where Jim's story ends.
But late at night, when the stars are right
And the moon is gray and dim,
Two ghostly figures roll around
On the grave of Gemini Jim.
One is the ghost of Scorpio Sal

Now, friends, this works for some of the guys sometimes but there's a whole lotta guys running up and down 16th Avenue South here and you can see them at Tootsie's and you can see 'em at The Country Corner. And these boys have a whole lotta dreams, same way I had mine, but sometimes they come true and sometimes they don't.) 

I was hanging 'round Nashville writing songs
And playing 'em for all of the stars,
Watchin' 'em laugh and hand 'em back,
Living on hope and Hershey bars.
So, I pawned my guitar and bought a ticket home,
And I's a'headin' for the Trailway bus
When I seen an old fountain pen laying in the gutter,
So I stopped and picked it up.

It was worn-out, bent and cast aside --
Kinda sorta like myself,
So I sat down on the curb and wrote a little song
That told the world how both of us felt.
Then I run that song down to Music Row
And before I had time to spit,
It's pitched and sold and cut for a record
And moving up the charts and, damn, it's a hit!

So I wrote me another winner,
Then I wrote me a smash again,
And I's a'flyin' off the ground,
'Cause I knew I'd found me a sure hit songwriter's pen.

So the songs they just kept a'pourin' out,
And the money kept pouring in.
I just couldn't miss, all it took was a twist
Of my sure hit songwriter's pen.
Remember when I won the Grammy,
Then I won it again and again?
Well, none of you knew it was all due
To my sure hit songwriter's pen.

I was darling with all the ladies.
I was a hero among the men...
Making big dough, working rodeos and TV shows --
Me and my sure hit songwriter's pen.

But then one night in Wichita
I was just coming off of the stage,
Folks all lined up screaming for my autograph...
Lord, I was a national rage.
One little freckled face girl was there, she said,
""I got no pencil, sir.""

So I signed it with my songwriter's pen
And then handed the pen back to her!
Four o'clock that morning, I woke up with the shakes and the bends
With terror in my eyes 'cause, good God, I realized
I'd lost my sure hit songwriter's pen.

I offered rewards in the papers
I pleaded on the Sympathy Line,
And a whole lotta folks and a whole lotta pens,
But none of them pen's was mine.
So my songs got worse and my money ran out
And so did all my good-time friends.
And there was no doubt I was nothing without
My long-lost sure hit songwriter's pen.

So I rolled like a stone down to old Skid Row
Where I feed my blues on wine
And I rest my chops in a two-bit flop
And I tell my story for a drink or a dime
And I sleep with my shoes underneath my head
And dream about days back then
When I blazed my name across the sky
With my sure hit songwriter's pen.

Somewhere in Wichita some little girl
Who's a freckled face nine or ten
Is doing her arithmetic homework tonight
With a sure hit songwriter's pen.

And I say, God bless ya, honey
You got yourself a sure hit songwriter's pen there

It was Sat night at the slammer
The gavel was falling like a hammer
As they dragged in every freak
From off the road
One by one they entered the cell
And the stories that they had to tell
Were all different 
But all seemed to end on the very same note

""They held me down and they put it on my nose
They even sprinkled a little bit on my clothes
Yeahâ?¦ I know what you're thinkin
But I ain't one of those
Noâ?¦ they held me down and put it in my nose.""

This wino in the corner got up and shook himself outâ?¦.
He said, 
""Well they held me down and poured it down my throat
That's what they did.
They even planted the bottle in my coat
Anybody want some?
Yeahâ?¦ the reason why my pants so wet 
Is they pushed me off the boat
After they held me down and poured it down my throat.""

And this chick in the next cellâ?¦
She said,
""I heard you guys talking
And let me tell you somethingâ?¦
He held me down and he put it you know where
Ohhhhâ?¦ I told him I was a virgin
But he didn't care
Nooooâ?¦ the pig!
Ahhhhâ?¦ you see his wallet's in my purse.
What's it doing there?
He held me down and put it you know where.""

And then this cat got up.
Wellâ?¦ he half got up.
He lifted his head and, 
He said,
""Hey, manâ?¦ hey held me down and they put it in my vein.
They even held a pistol to my brain
Or I wouldn'ta done it
Ohhh.. these scars on my arms are where I crashed through the window paneâ?¦
Tryin' to get awaaaaaaaaay
When they held me down and put it in my vein.""

And then this cat.. a rollie-eyed cat in a raincoat, and shoes 
And the bottom of his pants were cut off at the knees
He said,
""She held me down and put it in my face.
Oh, the disgrace.
And that's the fact on which I'm gonna base my case.
She was overweight and underage.
And we was at my place.
But she held me down and put it in my face.""

Shel Silverstein,"Well, big John Henry Rucker
He was a greasy motor trucker
And he drove them big ol' diesels to L.A.
Drivin' outta Mobile
His darlin' wife, Camille
She would kiss him in his driveway
And she'd say
She'd say:


(Camille) Don't go to sleep on the road, baby
(I won't)
Don't go to sleep on the road
(Lord, protect me)
Take what it takes (uh huh) to keep you awake
(I will)
But don't go to sleep on the road.

Then Camille started singin' country music for a friend
Well you know a girl can't stay too long alone.
First for friends
And then in bars
Then she soon became a star
And sometimes he'd hear her record
And he'd groan...
Singin':


(Camille) Don't go to sleep on the road, baby
(Shel) (Tears in his eyes)
Don't go to sleep on the road
Take what it takes (uh huh) to keep you awake
(Shel) (I will)
But don't go to sleep on the road.

Yes... and her records started movin' up the charts
And became number one
And she got.. she got entertainer of the year
And she got her hair done
And got a boob job
And got her an affair with the bass player.
And he got hemorrhoids.

He was drivin' hell for leather
Through the California weather
When that California sky began to rain
And that hill was wet and steep
Oh, he shore could use some sleep
But his darlin's words kept ringin' through his brain.

(Camille singing chorus in the background while Shel sings:)

That eastbound rig was hummin'
Lord, he never seen it comin'
And he woke up starin' at the sky
In the wreck and in the rain
With the radio still playin'
And the last words that he heard before he died
Was Camille
Still singin':

(Camille) Don't go to sleep on the road, baby
(Shel) (What a way to die)
(Camille) Don't go to sleep on the road
(Camille and Shel) Take what it takes to keep you awake
Oh, but don't go to sleep on the road.

Shel Silverstein,"'Twas sunset down in old Key West
The locals all were high.
The tourists snapped their photographs
And munched their Key Lime pie.
And meanwhile down at Sloppy Joe's
The drinks were standin' tall
With Buffett on the jukebox 
And Hemingway on the wall.

Then up spoke Sam the Shrimper:
He said, ""I've been a shrimper all my life.
My daddy was a shrimper
And my mom's a shrimper's wife.
And I'm tired of bein' a shrimper
'cause a shrimper's life's too tame
So I'm gonna ride the Conch Train, boys,
And be like Jesse James.
Gonna be like Jesse James, boy...
Gonna be like Jesse James.
Case you didn't hear me the first three times...
Gonna be like Jesse James.""

Now the Conch Train is a tourist toy
That rolls through Key West Town
Like some weird ride from Disneyland
It drives the tourists round and round
While the engineer on her P.A. 
Points out all the sites
""Well, Tennessee did you-know-what 
To you-know-who that night.""

""The tourists all have money"", said Sam
""Their wives all have rings of gold.
Their mopeds all are pawnable.
Their cameras can be sold.
And think of all the glory, boys,
The money and the fame
To be the first and only man
To rob the Key West Train.""

Now the engineer of the Conch Train
Her name was Betsy Wright.
She drove the Conch Train all day long
And loved Shrimper Sam all night.
And with some sweet persuasion,
She agreed to join the game:
She'd slow it down and flag the lad
And let him ride the train.

The conch train made its turn
Down the Smathers Pitch
When Shrimper Sam with a snorkle eye
Leaped naked from the sea.
His fillet knife was in his hand.
He jumped aboard the train.
""Give up your bucks, you tourist schmucks.
I'm Key West Jesse James.
I'm Key West Jesse James, boy...
Key West Jesse James...
Case you didn't hear me the first three times...
I'm Key West Jesse James.""

Now unbeknownst to Shrimper Sam
In the third car from the rear,
Sat Kelso Bolls from Muscle Shoals,
An American Legioneer.
He was a redneck of respect
And a marksman of reknown.
From under his fat
He drew a Gat,
And shot the shrimper down.

Now the first time that he shot poor Sam,
Sam groaned and clutched his side.
The second time that he shot poor Sam,
Sam fell to his knees and cried.
And the third time that he shot poor Sam,
You could see in both their eyes
Lash LaRue and Randolph Scott
Beneath the Western skies.

We laid poor Sam upon the sand
And we lifted up his head.
We listened close to hear the words
The dying shrimper said.
He said, ""Boys, you know I had my chance
But I went and botched the job,
But how can a boy named Jesse James
Without a train to rob?""
Then Kelso Bolls took off his hat
And the tears streamed down his face.
He said, ""Son, I know just how you feel.
This world's a changin' place"".
When history is written,
Uh... they won't recall our names,
But I only got to play Pat Garrett
'cause you played Jesse James.

We buried Sam in the southernmost sands
Close by the southernmost waves
Where sweet Betsy Wright
Cries tears every night
Onto his southernmost grave.
And on his tombstone say the words
""Stick to your own game.
And if you are a shrimper,
Do not try to rob a train.""",The Great Conch Train Robbery,1979

",Once More with Feeling,1999
Shel Silverstein,"In the laid back California town of sunny San Rafael
Lived a girl named Pearly Sweetcake, you prob'ly knew her well.
She'd been stoned fifteen of her eighteen years and the story was widely told
That she could smoke 'em faster than anyone could roll.
Her legend finally reached New York, that Grove Street walk-up flat
Where dwelt The Calistoga Kid, a beatnik from the past
With long browned lightnin' fingers he takes a cultured toke
And says, â??Hell, I can roll â??em faster, Jim, than any chick can smoke!â??

So a note gets sent to San Rafael, â??For the Championship of the World
The Kid demands a smoke off!â?? ""Well, bring him on!"" says Pearl,
""I'll grind his fingers off his hands, he'll roll until he drops!""
Says Calistog, ""I'll smoke that twist till she blows up and pops!â??
So they rent out Yankee Stadium and the word is quickly spread
""Come one, come all, who walk or crawl, price â?? just two lids a head
And from every town and hamlet, over land and sea they speed
The world's greatest dopers, with the Worlds greatest weed
Hashishers from Morocco, hemp smokers from Peru
And the Shamnicks from Bagun who puff the deadly Pugaroo
And those who call it Light of Life and those that call it boo.

See the dealers and their ladies wearing turquoise, lace, and leather
See the narcos and the closet smokers puffin' all together
From the teenies who smoke legal to the ones who've done some time
To the old man who smoked â??reeferâ?? back before it was a crime
And the grand old house that Ruth built is filled with the smoke and cries
Of fifty thousand screaming heads all stoned out of their minds.
And they play the national anthem and the crowd lets out a roar
As the spotlight hits The Kid and Pearl, ready for their smokin' war
At a table piled up high with grass, as high as a mountain peak
Just tops and buds of the rarest flowers, not one stem, branch or seed.

Maui Wowie, Panama Red and Acapulco Gold.
Kif from East Afghanistan and rare Alaskan Cold.
Sticks from Thailand, Ganja from the Islands, and Bangkok's Bloomin' Best.
And some of that wet imported shit that capsized off Key West.
Oaxacan tops and Kenya Bhang and Riviera Fleurs.
And that rare Manhatten Silver that grows down in the New York sewers.
And there's bubblin' ice cold lemonade and sweet grapes by the bunches.
And there's Hershey's bars, and Oreos, â??case anybody gets the munchies.
And the Calistoga Kid, he sneers, and Pearly, she just grins.
And the drums roll low and the crowd yells â??GO!â?? and the world's first Smoke Off begins.

Kid flicks his magic fingers once and ZAP! that first joint's rolled.
Pearl takes one drag with her mighty lungs and WOOSH! that roach is cold.
Then The Kid he rolls his Super Bomb that'd paralyze a moose.
And Pearley takes one super hit and SLURP! that bomb' defused.
Then he rolls three in just ten seconds and she smokes 'em up in nine,
And everybody sits back and says, ""This just might take some time.""
See the blur of flyin' fingers, see the red coal burnin' bright
As the night turns into mornin' and the mornin' fades to night
And the autumn turns to summer and a whole damn year is gone
But the two still sit on that roach-filled stage, smokin' and rollin' on
With tremblin' hands he rolls his jays with fingers blue and stiff
She coughs and stares with bloodshot gaze, and puffs through blistered lips.
And as she reaches out her hand for another stick of gold
The Kid he gasps, ""Goddamn it, bitch, there's nothin' left to roll!""
""Nothin' left to roll?"", screams Pearl, ""Is this some twisted joke?â??
â??I didn't come here to fuck around, man, I come here to SMOKE!""
And she reaches 'cross the table And grabs his bony sleeves
And she crumbles his body between her hands like dried and brittle leaves
Flickin' out his teeth and bones like useless stems and seeds
And then she rolls him in a Zig Zag and lights him like a roach.
And the fastest man with the fastest hands goes up in a puff of smoke.

In the laid-back California town of sunny San Rafael
Lives a girl named Pearly Sweetcake, you prob'ly know her well.
She's been stoned twenty-one of her twenty-four years, and the story's widely told.
How she still can smoke them faster than anyone can roll
While off in New York City on a street that has no name.

And underneath his fingers there's a little golden scroll

But all I wanted all my life
Was a TV set and a truck and a wife
And a front row seat to hear ole Johnny sing.

And I got that girl with a little old Woolworth ring
And life was warm and life was sweet
But still, it was kinda incomplete
Without a front row seat to hear ole Johnny sing.

Hey, John you walk the line,
Do ""Deelia"" one more time
And when you do them Cottonfields
You warm this heart of mine.

So, one day I thought, Hey, I'm gonna do it!

So, I mortgaged the farm and pawned her wedding ring.
I sold the gold tooth out of my mouth
And jumped in the pickup and headed South.
For a front row seat to hear ole Johnny sing.

I hit Nashville cold and wet and hungry.
I said, ""I'm here, bring him on let him do his thing.""
But they told me down at the Old Pit Grill
I'd have to go all the way to Andersonville
For a front row seat to hear ole Jonny sing.

I found his house knocked on the door and it was opened
By a brown-haired girl and a baby with a teethin' ring.
I said ""I seen you somewhere before
But don't stand there and block the door
I want a front row seat to hear ole Johnny sing.""

(chorus)

She said I'd have to go down to The Opry
And the feller there said I'd have to wait till Spring.
He said, ""We've been sold out for months and months
And this poor insane fellah wants
A front row seat to hear ole Johnny sing.""

Well, he said a couple more things, and I started cryin'
And then he laughed at me and that's when I started to swing.
Well I bust through the doors in a roaring rage,
Crawled over the crowd till I reached the stage
For a front row seat to hear ole Johnny sing.

(chrous)

Then some crazy guard started shootin'
I shot back, and the next thing I know I was winged
And on the floor
When a guy in a voice kinda deep and low
Says, ""Boy that's a mighty long way to go
For a front row seat to hear ANYBODY sing.""

And I guess that judge, he weren't no music lover.
I got fifteen months but that don't mean a thing.
'cause' yesterday in the prison yard
A show come through and HAR! de HAR!
I had a front row seat to hear ole Johnny sing.

Was before he left, he went and named me Sue

Seems I had to fight my whole life through
Some gal would giggle and I'd turn red
And some guy'd laugh and I'd bust his head

My fist got hard and my wits got keener

And I just hit town and my throat was dry
Thought I'd stop and have myself a brew

There at a table, dealing stud
Sat the dirty, mangy dog that named me Sue

Well, I knew that snake was my own sweet dad
From a worn-out picture that my mother'd had
Knew that scar on his cheek and his evil eye
He was big and bent and gray and old
And I looked at him and my blood ran col
And I said, ""my name is Sue, how do you do?
Now you gonna die""

Well, I hit him hard right between the eyes
And he went down, but to my surprise
He come up with a knife and cut off a piece of my ear
Then I busted a chair right across his teeth
And we crashed through the walls and into the street
Kicking and a' gouging in the mud and the blood and the beer

Well I tell ya, I've fought tougher men
But I really can't remember when
He kicked like a mule and he bit like a crocodile
I heard him laugh and then I heard him cuss
And he reached for his gun but I pulled mine first
He stood there lookin' at me and I saw him smile

And he said, ""son, this world is rough
And if a man's gonna make it, he's gotta be tough
And I knew I wouldn't be there to help you along
So I give ya that name and I said goodbye
And I knew you'd have to get tough or die
It's that name that helped to make you strong""

He said, ""now you just fought one heck of a fight
And I know you hate me, and you got the right
To kill me now, and I wouldn't blame you if you do
But y ought to thank me, before I die
For the gravel in ya gut and the spit in ya eye
'Cause I'm the, that named you Sue""

What could I do?  
I got all choked up and I threw down my gun
I called him my pa, and he called me his son
Come away with a different point of view

That stops right down the block.
Then the old piano minstrel
Plays her song as she walks in,
And the Queen of the Silver Dollar's home again.

She's the Queen of the Silver Dollar,
And she rules this smoky kingdom.
And her scepter is a wine glass,
And this bar stool is her throne.
And the jesters flock around her,
And fight to win her favors
And see which one will take the Queen
Of the Silver Dollar home.

Her royal gown is a satin dress
That's stained and slightly torn.
And her sparklin' jewels are rhinestones,
And her shoes are scuffed and worn
From the many roads she's traveled
And the wondrous sites she's seen.
And I watch her and I pray.
God save the Queen.

The Queen of the Silver Dollar's
Not as haughty as she seems.
She was once an ordinary girl
With ordinary dreams,
But I found her and I won her.
And I brought her into this world.
Yes, I'm the man who made a Queen
Of a simple country girl.

Now she's the Queen of the Silver Dollar,
And she rules this smoky kingdom.
And her scepter is a wine glass,
And this bar stool is her throne.
And the jesters flock around her
And fight to win her favors
And see which one will take the Queen
Of the Silver Dollar home.",Queen of the Silver Dollar,2005

To places and make her fly higher than she's ever dared to
He'll take his time before takin' advantage
Takin' her easy and slow
And after he's taken the body and soul
That she gives him, he'll take her for granted
Then he'll take off and leave her
Takin' all of her pride as he goes

He's a charmer, and he'll charm her
With money and manners that I never learned
He's a leader, and he'll lead her
Across pretty bridges he's planning to burn
He's a talker, he'll talk her
Right off of her feet, but he won't talk for long
Cause he's a doer, and he'll do her
The way that I never
And damned if he won't do her wrong

""Go! And I'll go with you.
Open your mouth and I will speak for you.""

They won't believe on me.
I would not be a sinner,
Tell you the reason why:
'Fraid the Lord might call me
And I wouldn't be ready to die.

But your lips deny they're true
Will your answer really change things?
Making me blue

I'm afraid, someday you'll leave me
Saying can we still be friends?
If you go, you know you'll grieve me

Am I guessing that you love me?

I ran into some dreams that we left scattered

That's what I'm longin' for,

Any fool could see that I'm
Fallin' fast, dancin' slow
Wonderin' where we go from
Here, tonight

Could it be friends
Could find so easily, love at last
If you know
Tell me where we go from here

We both know that life is so uncertain
A night like this may never come again
Maybe this is our one chance
For all we know
Tell me where we go from here

We both know
Darlin' where we go from here

With each kiss
We both know
Darlin' where we go from here

I held your head as you were goin under
Saw you get lost in all your dreams
You amazed me with your ways
Just to feel you made me crazy

You found a way to get me back
Saved me from my darkest hour

I Cry Everyday

Hey Darling
Got a little news for you
Don't need your sympathy
Just want a little care from you

",I Cry Everyday,2005
Shelby Lynne,"You look like an art piece floating in my mind
And I am told fortunes are gold
Fortunes are gold.
Bucket loads of gratitude I feel for you
You are fine. I pour you like wine, pour you like wine.

As the desert sky turns into shadow light
Beside me on my bed tonight
Your love is the only light I see
You feel like the only home I've ever known
And I am shown
Tonight.

You seem like a memory that I've always known
And it has shown as long as I go, long as I go.
Safe and lost forever in a fantasy
Tosses and turns. My heart never yearns. My heart never yearns.

There's no better place to be than in your eyes.
There's no other sight to see
You're the cornbread and iced tea of life.

You feel like the only home I've ever known
And I am shown tonight
Oh how I'm shown
Goodnight.

",Iced Tea,2005
Shelby Lynne,"Before you go walk out on me
Take a look around tell me what you see
Here I stand like an open book
Is there something here you might have overlooked
'Cause it would be a shame if you should leave
And find that freedom ain't what you thought it would be

The years we had were not all bad
In fact I know the good outweighed the bad
Now you say that you've grown tired
You want to be by yourself a while
It would be a shame if you should go
And find that freedom was a long time ago

I know that you can't stand the chains that bind you
They just keep on drivin' us apart
You could go where I could never find you
But could you go far enough to get away from your heart

So one more time, for ol' times sake
Come and lay your head upon my chest
Please don't throw this moment away
We can forget the bad and take the best
If you don't have nothing left to say
Let me hold you one more time for ol' times sake

If you don't have nothing left to say
Let me hold you one more time for ol' times sake",Old Times Sake,2005
Shelby Lynne,"Sleep. Come on in.
I would like for you to spend the night with me.
Sleep. Where you been.
I have surely missed you since you've been gone.
I have walked the dirt and seen the clouds in the sky and
Seen them different in the daytime.
It hurts my eyes to close them cause they only close to blink away the tears that I cry.

Sleep. Be my friend.
I could use a close one to remind me how to live again.
Sleep. Make it end.
Let me rest and lie beside my tired old bones and hold me.
Sing to me a lullaby on hopes of shutting down these eyes and close out the world.
Force me to dream so I'll know I've slept and shelter me from daylights creeping fingers.

Sleep. Please appear.
Show to me your face and tell me it's ok to rest.
Sleep. Help me try,
To put my body down on pillows made out of my Mama's womb.
Satisfy my eagerness for comfort in this time of worry let me let it go.
When I'm sure the lights are out and sandman throws himself about
I'll trust you again.

Sleep. Say my prayers.
Asking for a place that looks like all the nighttime fantasies.
Sleep. Are you here?
Are you real and am I snuggling down tonight?



",Sleep,2005
Shelby Lynne,"Hoverin' by my suitcase
Tryin' to find a warm place to spend the night
A heavy rain a fallin'
Seems I hear your voice callin'
""It's all right""

A rainy night in Georgia
A rainy night in Georgia
I believe it's rainin' all over the world

Neon signs a flashin'
Taxi cabs and busses passin' through the night
The distant moanin' of a train
Seems to play a sad refrain to the night

A rainy night in Georgia
A rainy night in Georgia
I believe it's rainin' all over the world

How many times I've wondered
It still comes out the same
No matter how you look at it, think of it
You just got to do your own thing

I find me a place in a box car
So I take out my guitar to pass some time
Late at night when it's hard to rest
I hold your picture to my chest
And I'm all right

A rainy night in Georgia
A rainy night in Georgia
I believe it's rainin' all over the world",Track 12,2005
Shelby Lynne,"Can't believe the words you said your voice keeps hitting me in the head
I remember when you told me you'd never say mean things like that.
Thought you had your love in tact but I was wrong thinking things like that
Might be time to reconsider what my plans have been.

Cause when the girls walked by I could see that you never really wanted to be with me
Out the corner of your eye you were saying hi you're never satisfied.

You don't have a heart.
You don't have a soul.
You don't see things clear and baby I'm too old
To teach you about love
Or get down on my knees
I wish you the best but it's time for me to leave
No, You don't have a heart.

Oh I used to think that you had it all you said the words and I'd start to crawl
What a fool believes is the everything.
Oh I must have had a head made out of wood wasn't thinking with my brain like I know I should.
My heart led the way but I'm not ashamed.

Cause when a woman's blind to all the heartaches she never knows the price she's gonna have to pay
You stole my heart and took my pride but I'll survive and come out on the other side.

Chorus

Oh we all reap what we all sow your times coming you don't even know.
It's worth the wait to watch you burn
I'm front row center as the tables turn.

Had a very shiny nose
And if you ever saw it
You would even say it glows
All of the other reindeer
(reindeer)
Used to laugh and call him names
They never let poor Rudolph
Play in any reindeer games

Then one foggy Christmas Eve
Santa came to say
Rudolph with your nose so bright
Won't you guide my sleigh tonight?
Then all the reindeer loved him
And they shouted out with glee
""Rudolph the red-nosed reindeer
You'll go down in history!""",Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer,2010

in the eyes which I say is not the fact.

All that when Mac perform
*Who The Fuck Want What*, man they buck when that come on
Bitches givin up butt when Mac perform
Everybody hands up when that track come on

Roll up nigga let's get on
You know how we do, bitches in them see through dresses on
Double shots of Henny rock, all night lemon drops
'Til they touchin, have 'em touchin, other women's spots

Late night, club night, you know what Mac like
Late night, club night, Mac attract dikes
All night menagie trois, who came to get ride, who came to get high
What the fuck, uh

[Chorus]

Last call for alcohol, all drinks on me
Just boots, jean suits, no mix on me
Bandannas, really liks on me
Alright maybe a watch, of course rock, what you think on me?

Same thing with the squad, what you think on Bleek
Beef? Come on dog who you think gon bleed
Not Mac, never slip in the club
4/5th in the club, told why'all never slip in the club

Niggas hit like shit, how that get in the club
You think I'm playin when I'm sayin shit'll drip in the club?
Man I come to turn out the show, turn out a hoe
Before I bounce, burn an ounce of 'dro

Throw back an ounce of snow, bounce with dough
Squad deep, all with heat, and the bouncers know
Back the fuck up dog or the rounds'll blow
Man a thug in the club, why'all know how it go, shit

[Chorus]",In the Club,2003
Shelene Thomas,"It's a new day
And all you gossipin backstabbin habitual haters
You're all history (hissss-to-ry)
So you can hate, or hail the Queen (all hail, the Queen)
But it don't matter (but it don't matter)
Cause you ain't got nuttin, for us (you ain't got nothin.. for us)
So as long as you live, remember this

[Chorus: Shelene Thomas]
You can't fuck with Queen Bee.. Queen Bee.. Queen Bee!
All you haters will see.. see.. see!

Don't be mad, I can't put this - money in a casket
I can't put these - cars in a box with the ashes
I can't take these diamonds with me when I day
I can't build that pretty white house in the sky
I know you wishin that you wrote this song
But these same words comin from you, would be a joke
You better off takin heed from your boy Jada
I know you, hate dyin - but you gon' die a hater
I got a vision, I think for the future baby pah
why'all nearsighted, lotta why'all, can't see that far
Rocks like the street light - baby watch 'em glow
Red yellow and green - don't know whether to stop or go
I'm a chameleon, I got many styles of rhymes
Like a bottle of fine wine I just get better with time
From ""Hardcore"" to ""Notorious"" you studied my flow
And still..

[Chorus] + Governor ad libs
[Lil' Kim]
Whether ya, slingin the rock or you got a wicked jump shot
Or just a fiend for this Queen Bitch of hip-hop
Kimmie bag dudes from the barbershop to the car show
The industry, down to Wall Street
They ask:

[Governor]
What is she like, what does she need?
What is her type, I want to give it to her, tell her please
Be my girl, I'll give her anything
Whatever her heart desires, in this whole world

[Lil' Kim]
Just cause you ain't a millionaire don't mean you can't compete
You ain't gotta be filthy rich, but you can't be cheap
I like a man that can stand on his own two feet
Got a strong business mind, straight out the streets
He gotta have security, power and wealth
Cause I can do bad by my God damn self
And if you spiritual, got a good heart and can make me laugh
And can fuck..

[Chorus Two: Shelene Thomas] + (Governor)
You can get with Queen Bee.. (y'all can get with Queen Bee)
Queen Bee.. (yeah, ye yeah) Queen Bee! (awww)
Take you to ecstasy (she gon' take why'all to ecstasy)
Ecstasy.. (do it to 'em Queen Bee) Ecstasy!
(Yeah.. it's yo' time baby, it's yo' time girl!)

[Lil' Kim]
Ain't nuttin gon' change, my name, gon' get bigger
It's in the cards for Lil' Kim to get richer, and richer
So like it or not, I am who I am
When I die hold my body in the Brooklyn Museum
Now take it to the bridge

[Full Force] + (Lil' Kim)
Baye-ya-da, da, da-da-dahhhhh
(Don't that feel good?)
(Full Force sing the break one more time, see'mon, see'mon)
Baye-ya-da, da, da-da-dahhhhh
(Don't that sound so nice?)

[Chorus] + various ad libs by Kim and Governor
[Chorus Two] + ad libs by all artists
[Shelene] + (Governor)
Gotta let 'em know
Let 'em knowowwwww (let 'em know Bee!)
Can't see the Queen (Give it to 'em Bee)
Queen Bee (give it to 'em Bee) Queen Bee! (yea yea, yeah)
