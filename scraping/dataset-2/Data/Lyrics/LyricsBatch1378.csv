Carl Brave X Franco 126,"Abbiamo portato tuo fratello all'Aquafan
Ha pisciato in acqua e tu gli hai detto ""bahaha""
Perché si inizia a colorare, ti vorresti sotterrare (giù)
Io che volevo andare al mare
Un boro co' una maglia ""Italians do it better"" (oh)
Lei cammina a passo svelto è fiera del suo setter
Litighiamo, pare un telefilm di La7
Abbiamo urlato e pareva che il cielo cadesse
T’ho scroccato una ciospa anche se non fumo, eh
Fai trentuno t'ho portata ad Anzio a mangia' il crudo, eh
Tu che dobbiamo parlare, io che resto muto
In TV un imbecille dice ""Italia 1""
Vorrei lasciare tutto quanto per un chiosco a Bali
Un cartello dice ""Shark attack"" e non è Cali
Noi che d'inverno ci vestiamo a strati
D'estate famo l'alba e al mare ci andiamo domani
Lei è spiaggiata che mi scrive ""amore mio ma quando cali""

Io che t'ho dato tutto, mo' non posso lascia' mance
E mi puoi dire tutto, tanto tutto non mi tange
Uramaki California la mia amica a caccia di surfisti abbronzi in California
T’aspetto di qua, non ci so' Cadillac
Abbiamo fatto crack e amo' lasciami stare
Io che volevo solo il mare

Do un calcio a un Super Santos, ma va un po' dove vuole lui
Alzo lo sguardo al cielo e strizzo gli occhi al sole
Nel naso il fumo di uno zampirone
Il ronzio di zanzare e quello del ventilatore
Scendi sotto casa e ti passo a pigliare
Ed oggi il meteo dice che il mare è una tavola
Ma sto da un'ora fermo in coda in tangenziale
Butto dal finestrino lo stecco di un Fior di Fragola
E se resto qua-ah e quando passi fammi un fischio
Stesso ba-ar e quando vuoi mi trovi là, ehi
Sulla mano un timbro sbiadito
Lei attacca sempre al quarto squillo
Macchia di rossetto, il filtro della Winston
Metti che pijo un last minute e mi invento un'altra vita
Mi subaffitto casa e scappo per la Costa Rica
Ritiro gli ultimi risparmi che c’ho sulla VISA
E come è ita è ita
Mi penso sopra la spiaggia di quel depliant
Intanto accolla due spicci per il Telepass

Io che t'ho dato tutto mo' non posso lascia' mance
E mi puoi dire tutto tanto tutto non mi tange
Uramaki California la mia amica
A caccia di surfisti abbronzi in California
T’aspetto di qua, non ci so' Cadillac
Abbiamo fatto crack e amo' lasciami stare
Io che volevo solo il mare",Medusa,2017
Carl Brave X Franco 126,"Lei scorre con le dita sul touch screen
Sorseggiando uno spritz, risponde a monosillabi
Tra una settimana parte per Madrid
Io lo sapevo finiva così
Ho ciccato dentro tutti i bicchieri
Gabbiani frugano nei sacchi neri
Tu non mi credi e sbatti i piedi
Sai già la risposta, allora perché me lo chiedi?
Oggi non ne ho fatta una giusta, mea culpa
È più di un'ora fa che avevamo la punta
Di nuovo scontri in curva tra polizia e ultras
Faccio la sauna nella metro nell'ora di punta
Lei gira in casa scalza, serrande a mezz'asta
Apri la finestra che c'è cappa
È passata una vita e non mi passa

Na na, ancora che stamo pe' l'aria
Ancora che stamo pe' l'aria
Ancora che stamo pe' l'aria, eh

Ancora che stamo pe' l'aria

Sul tram un rom suona la fisarmonica
Un SUV, un Casamonica
La paga è sempre modica (eh eh)
Villa Pamphili è verde, pare l'Amazzonia
Io a casa che guardavo La Posta di Sonia
I pizzardoni che mi fanno un'altra multa (eh dai)
Sale sul buitoni dammi un po' di junta (eh dai)
Lei è di Roma però è della Lazio (eh beh)
Annoiata sta giocando a Ruzzle
Ho speso tutti i miei risparmi all'all you can eat
E ho confuso il venerdì per il lunedì
Famo chiusura ad Ibiza, giuro che sono in lista
Riempi quella Rizla (eh eh eh)
Lei fa la faiga, metto like e lei mi slika
Indossa polo di Stone Island (eh eh eh)
Le zanzare tigri in aria
I miei amici che vanno allo stadio a tifa' Roma alè

Na na, ancora che stamo pe' l'aria
Ancora che stamo pe' l'aria

Carl Brave X Franco 126,"Eri girasole e poi sei diventata ortica, da
Gemelli siamesi a ""Giuro non ti ho mai capita""
Ti ho chiamata con un filo tra i bicchieri
Ti rivedo dopo anni e sembra ieri
Stesi sotto i platani
Sopra una rivista vintage che parla di Platini
Dici se esce femmina la chiameremo Natalie
Io che ho fatto le corna (ehi)
Canticchiando un ritornello in un inglese fake
Tu dimmi cosa vedi nella forma delle nuvole
Al cinema l'ennesimo remake ne sono usciti tre
Di quel film cult che non ho visto mai
Ma che danno ogni Natale in Rai

E mano nella mano
Si incrocia la mia linea della vita con la tua
Com’edere sul muro che si affaccia sulla via
Ci perdiamo nel ghiaccio di un bicchiere di Kahlúa
Brindiamo alla mia, brindiamo alla tua

Alla mia, alla tua
Brindiamo alla mia, brindiamo alla tua
Alla mia, alla tua
Brindiamo alla mia, brindiamo alla tua

Sul nove un film in cui vincono i buoni
Guardo fuori e sembra ieri
Con la pioggia nei bicchieri e la testa sempre altrove
Aspettando da ore il 19 che non passa
Bastava uno sbadiglio e non servivano parole
Forse mi stai pensando che mi fischiano le orecchie
Non ho memoria breve non mantengo le promesse mai
Rincorro sempre le lancette
C’è qualcuno nella tasca che mi annoda le cuffiette sai
Resto solo in bilico sopra un filo di fumo
Con l’amaro dei caffè che non abbiamo mai bevuto
So dove vuoi andare a parare ma ti lascio parlare
C’è un vento che strattona le persiane

E mano nella mano
Si incrocia la mia linea della vita con la tua
Com’edere sul muro che si affaccia sulla via
Ci perdiamo nel ghiaccio di un bicchiere di Kahlúa
Brindiamo alla mia, brindiamo alla tua

Carl Brave X Franco 126,"Pio l'Enjoy, metto la retro
Do un bacetto al Pandino dei tuoi
'Na settimana che facciamo quello che vuoi
E 'sta domenica Porta Portese è isterica
Io con la solita scena patetica (hei)
Ridimmi il nome che
Quando mi presento penso solo a come dire il mio
Sai che so' un bravo fijo, lei mangia frutta Bio
È del Fleming ed è come se venissimo da altri pianeti
Così lontani però come fratelli siamesi
La terra trema, brividi da sotto i nostri piedi
Basterebbe preme' invio per dirti tutto in una mail
E tu sei online ma non ci sei
Famo una colla pe' una boccia a Ponte Milvio
Ci contagiamo come dopo uno sbadiglio
'Na mezza rissa con un boro x
Mi so' scordato un'altra volta il mio codice PIN

E si davvero stavamo un po' fuori
Ce ne siamo dette di ogni, di tutti i colori
Ti parlo sopra non sento ragioni
Abbiamo chiuso porte e sbattuto i portoni
E oggi mi sembra tutto sbagliato
Da rifare da punto e daccapo
Lei ha le lacrime e il trucco sbavato
Vorrei svegliarmi che è tutto passato

Lei si specchia con la selfie dell'iPhone
Beve Sauvignon
Un urlo tra i palazzi, la Roma avrà fatto un gol
A una piotta sull'Enjoy, buchiamo un altro stop
Abbiamo litigato e mi pareva una sitcom
E fuori è tutto buio
A parte qualche luce blu e una farmacia di turno
Mi sei sparita giusto nel tempo di uno starnuto
E io cocciuto che so tre ore che ti chiamo
Ma tu metti in muto
C’è la tramontana e un tormentone in radio
Giacche false a metà prezzo a un banco di Via Sannio
Hai rubato tutte le mie felpe dall'armadio
So' aumentate anche le sigarette al tabaccaio
So per certo cosa dire ma non te l’ho detto mai
E mi esce solo un ""Come stai?""
C’è un Super Tele che galleggia sopra il Tevere
Una boccata al mozzicone e soffio via la cenere

E si davvero stavamo un po' fuori
Ce ne siamo dette di ogni, di tutti i colori
Ti parlo sopra non sento ragioni
Abbiamo chiuso porte e sbattuto i portoni

Carl Brave X Franco 126,"Due rom fanno un falò con due buste Crai
Quel puttanone c'ha sicuro l'AIDS
Siamo finiti ancora dritti al night
In foto eri bella ho messo like
L'ho solo trescata non ricordo il nome
Schimichiamo dallo zozzone
Piscio su una fratta di Parco Sempione
Prendo meno del tuo filippino
Lei nella vasca rilegge Cioè
Odio il cappottino del suo carlino
Tombini tatuati S.P.Q.R
In giro solo marocchini e metronotte
I pazzi di quartiere con in mano i cocktail
Ho toccato il cielo con il gomito
E le ho scritto un papiro di cazzate con le emoticon

Stacco un'aletta dal pacchetto delle Lucky Strike

Ho una piramide di piatti nel lavello
Non ricordo mai qual è la strada in cui parcheggio
Al supermercato senza spicci pel carrello
Sotto casa un rom fa spesa dentro un cassonetto
Faccio due lavori e sono entrambi in nero
Al Pigneto mio fratello contratta co' un negro
Cazzo non ho rallentato c'era l'autovelox
T'ho tradita, m'hai tanato, io nel dubbio nego
Lei tra due esami si laurea in storia dell'arte
Ma se restava zitta era molto più interessante
Compro sottomarche di vodka dal minimarket
Promozione Fastweb? Riaggancio, no grazie
Il mio amico dice che sta sempre un pezzo avanti
Noi che barcolliamo siamo tutti belli andanti
Era la seconda a destra, mi sa che ti sbagli

Carl Brave X Franco 126,"Sto bestemmiando da due ore contro un bancomat
Mi sa tanto che mi ha fregato la mia MasterCard
Lei su un gradino che sta litigando coi collant
E ci mancavano solo le rose e il vucumprà
A cosa serve il Conto Arancio se sto sempre in rosso
Mi sto fumando sotto
Per darti spago ho perso il filo del discorso
Pareva una sitcom, sì con le risate sotto
Dici che faccio ""bla bla bla"", io sento solo ""coccodè""
E barcolliamo un cha cha cha
Tranquilla, bevo anche per te
Caffè amaro
Cerco il telecomando tra i cuscini del divano

Ho fatto una battuta e non faceva ride' 
Di colpo il gelo non sapevo più che dire 
M'hai detto famo aperitivo io ho preso tre bire 
E ho finito pure le tue noccioline 

Tuo nonno m'ha detto che era meglio quando c'era lui
E che so' tu-tutte ingiurie e che è su tu-tutte le furie
Voglio mangiare fino a stare male
Acqua e vino a colorare, lascia fare
Lei mi rimbalza come l'acqua sul cucchiaio
Dice me ne dice un paio se non me la squaglio
Ma prima passami la maio
Dice non mi sono accorto del suo nuovo taglio
Sei un rigore tirato di petto ma
T'ho fatta ride con un meme di Putin a petto e
E t'ho ripresa (ahi, ahi)
Ma continui a fa' l'offesa
Che scesa (ahi, ahi, ahi)

Carl Brave X Franco 126,"Una Graziella rosso fuoco legata a un lampione
Un piccione ha fatto il nido sopra il cornicione
Esco col nuovo ventone dal ventiquattrore
Gli edifici mi sembrano visi di persone
Clochard su di una panca di granito
E hanno coperto quel graffito con il manifesto di un partito
Io a passo svelto, infreddolito
Con le mani nelle maniche di un maglione sgualcito
'Sti guai una matrioska, l'abbiamo fatta grossa
Sono partito alla rincorsa di quel Frecciarossa
E io mi sono svegliato con un braccio addormentato
E mi hanno disegnato in faccia con l'Uniposca

Cambio giro, cambio bar
Ho preso nuove Adidas

Pozzanghere di vodka (eh)

Non ho un soldo ti accollo col 4088

Ed oggi sto in ritardo e ho preso pure tutti rossi

Scotch sulla fotocamera del Mac

Will he give you a rose he has tended with care

Hiding behind the rainbow's end

Someday you'll learn and your soul will burn and die

Carl Carlton,"Oh thank god this night is over
Ugly mugs in devastating dreams
Chased outta here
By the aid of a healing light
The first rays of a new born day

Stand up, get out start walking
Won't look back got a promise to fulfill
And all the space in my head is filled up with you
Little darlin' there ain't no more time for talking
And it all seems drop-dead complicated
Yet my aim is true

Girl I'm coming home to you
I was left
But you were right to say the through
Now your bad boy
Is gonna kick-start a change
Hang in honey don't get blue
I'm still in love with you

Breaking up is just so easy
But maintain a two some walks a gravel road
Resurrection is a skill only saints are good at
I want to, but I know I never will
And I know
It all seems dreadful complicated
Still my longing is so true

Way down in my heart burns a candle
An eternal flame burning just for you
No matter where you go, where you sleep
Whose songs you'll be singing
I wish that all your dreams may come true

Dem Himmel sei Dank, diese Nacht ist vorbei
Hässliche Gestalten in beängstigenden Träumen
Von der heilenden Kraft des Licht's vertrieben
Den ersten Strahl des neuen Tages
Ich steh' auf, geh' raus, setz mich in Bewegung
Schaue nicht zurück
Ich habe ein Versprechen zu erfüllen
Und jeder Winkel in meinem Schädel ist erfüllt mit dem Gedanken an dich
Little Darlin', da bleibt keine Zeit zum Reden
Und alles scheint so hoffnungslos kompliziert
Doch mein Ziel ist klar:
Girl, ich komme nach hause, zu dir
Ich wurde verlassen, doch du hattest recht
Als du sagtest, zwischen uns sei es aus
Doch jetzt wird dein ungezogener Junge
Einen furiosen Wandel vollziehen
Halte durch, Honey, nur nicht traurig sein
Ich liebe dich immer noch
Sich zu trennen ist so leicht
Doch eine Beziehung aufrechterhalten
Ist ein steiniger Weg
Wiederbelebung ist eine Fertigkeit
Die allein die Heiligen beherrschen
Ich würde es gerne, doch ich weiß, dass es mir nie gelingen wird
Tief in meinem Herzen brennt ein Licht
Eine ewige Flamme, die brennt nur für dich
Ganz gleich, wohin du auch gehst
Wo du schläfst
Wessen Lieder du singst
Ich wünsche dir, dass all deine Träume in Erfüllung gehen",Coming Home,1998

Carl Corcoran,"You think I notice that you're standing there right next to me
Am I supposed to bow my head and thank you gratefully
You break my heart and turn around to get what still remains
I sold my soul and bought my fear, my inner pain
Without a clue I trust I follow you with my eyes blind
And what I cannot see I need I cannot leave behind
With all those eyes on me, their hunger is insanity
I can see you standing there, do you want to be free do you want to be me

I don't want to be the only one
To see my name wrote up on the sun
I don't want to be the only one
To watch it fall into the sea
I don't want to have to play the game
To sell my soul, betray my name
I don't want to be the only one
To watch it fall into the sea

So you just sit there stuck
Afraid to risk reality
Those words are mine
And you can find them deep inside of me
You walk away
Some how dismayed at what you may have done
The lies, the dreams, the broken promises, the only one
I can't remember whose idea it was to make this real
Divided equally my feelings I still cannot feel
And there you are you're all alone inside your fantasy
I can see you standing there,
Do you want to be free, do you want to be me

I don't want to be the only one
To see my name wrote up on the sun
I don't want to be the only one
To watch it fall into the sea
I don't want to have to play the game
To sell my soul, betray my name
I don't want to be the only one
To watch it fall into the sea

And when the light is gone and it's just you and me
Will you allow us to be who we're supposed to be
Or will time erode our thoughts, our will, insanity

I don't want to be the only one
To see my name wrote up on the sun
I don't want to be the only one

Was a jolly happy soul
With a corncob pipe and a button nose
And his eyes made out of coal

Frosty the Snowman
Made the children laugh and play
And were they surprised when
Before their eyes
He came to life that day

There must have been some magic
In that old silk hat they found
For when they placed it on his head
He began to dance around

Frosty the Snowman
Was alive as he could be
And the children say
He could laugh and play
Just the same as you and me

Frosty the Snowman
Knew the sun was hot that day
So he said let's run
And we'll have fun
Now before I melt away

So down to the village
With a broomstick in his hand
Running here and there all around the square
Saying catch me if you can

He led them down the streets of town
Right to the traffic cop
And he only paused a moment when
He heard him holler stop

Had to hurry on his way
But he waved goodbye
Saying don't you cry
I'll be back again some day

A little old driver so lively and quick,
I knew in a moment it must be Saint Nick.
And more rapid than eagles his reindeer all came
As he shouted ?On Dasher? and each reindeer?s name.
And so up to the housetop the reindeer soon flew
With the sleigh full of toys and Saint Nicholas, too.
Down the chimney he came with a leap and a bound;
He was dressed allin fur, and his belly was round.

I've come to talk with you again,
Because a vision softly creeping,
Left its seeds while I was sleeping,
And the vision that was planted in my brain
Still remains
Within the sound of silence.
In restless dreams I walked alone
Narrow streets of cobblestone,
'Neath the halo of a street lamp,
I turned my collar to the cold and damp
When my eyes were stabbed by the flash of a neon light
That split the night
And touched the sound of silence.

And in the naked light I saw
Ten thousand people, maybe more.
People talking without speaking,
People hearing without listening,
People writing songs that voices never share
And no one dare
Disturb the sound of silence.

""Fools"" said I, ""You do not know
Silence like a cancer grows.
Hear my words that I might teach you,
Take my arms that I might reach you.""
But my words like silent raindrops fell,
And echoed
In the wells of silence

And the people bowed and prayed
To the neon god they made.
And the sign flashed out its warning,
In the words that it was forming.
And the sign said, ""The words of the prophets

Are written on the subway walls
And tenement halls.""
And whisper'd in the sounds of silence.",The Sound of Silence (Arr. David Cullen),2017

Carl Douglas,"I was born and raised down in Alabama
On a farm way back up in the woods
I was so ragged the kids would call me patches
Papa used to kid me about it
Of course deep down inside
He was thinkin' he had done all he could do
My papa was a great old man
I can see him with a shovel in his hand
See, education he never had
But he did wonders when the time got bad
A little money from the crops he raised
Barely paid the bills we made
Oh life had kicked him down to the plow
When he tried to get up life would kick him back down
One day papa called me to his dyin' bed
Put his hands on my shoulders And in tears he said
Patches, I'm depending on you son
To pull the family through My son, it's all left up to you

Two days later papa passed away
I became a man that day
So I told mama I was gonna quit school
But she said that was dad's strictest rule
So every morning 'fore I went to school
I fed the chickens and I chopped wood too
Sometimes I felt that I couldn't go on
I wanted to leave this but I wanted a home
But I always remembered what my daddy said
With tears in his eyes on his dyin' bed
He said, ""Patches, I'm depending on you son
I tried to do my best, It's up to you to do the rest
:
But then one day a strong rain came
And washed all the crops away
And at the age of thirteen I thought I was carrying
The weight of the whole world on my shoulders
And you know, mama knew what I was going through, Cause
Everyday I had to work the fields
Cause that's the only way we got our meals
You see, I was the oldest of a family
And everybody else depended on me
Every night I heard my mama pray
Lord, give him the strength to face another day
Though years have passed and all the kids are gone
I aimed to take my mama to a brand new home
God knows people that I shed a tear
My daddy's voice helped me through the years
Sayin', ""Patches, I'm depending on you son
To pull the family through My son, it's all left up to you
I could still hear papa when he'd say
Patches, I'm depending on you son
I tried to do my best It's up to you to do the rest"".",Patches,2003

Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb
Always reminding me that we're apart
You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms

Tells his fairytale
Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain
My stardust melody
The memory of love's refrain.",Stardust,1996

Just let you leave without a trace?
When I stand here taking every breath with you, ooh ooh
You're the only one who really knew me at all

How can you just walk away from me
When all I can do is watch you leave?
'Cause we've shared the laughter and the pain
And even shared the tears
You're the only one who really knew me at all

So take a look at me now
Well there's just an empty space
And there's nothing left here to remind me
Just the memory of your face
Take a look at me now

Well there's just an empty space
And you coming back to me is against the odds
And that's what I've got to face, oh

I wish I could just make you turn around
Turn around and see me cry
There's so much I need to say to you
So many reasons why
You're the only one who really knew me at all

So take a look at me now

And there's nothing left here to remind me

Carl Doy,"I believe that children are our future;
Teach them well and let them lead the way.
Show them all the beauty they possess inside.
Give them a sense of pride, to make it easier;
Let the children's laughter remind us how we use to be.
 
Everybody's searching for a hero;
People need someone to look up to.
I never found anyone who fulfilled my need.
A lonely place to be, and so I learned to depend on me.
 
I decided long ago never to walk in anyone's shadow.
If I fail, if I succeed. 
At least I lived as I believe. 
No matter what they take from me,
They can't take away my dignity.
 
Because the greatest love of all is happening to me.
I found the greatest love of all inside of me.
The greatest love of all is easy to achieve.
Learning to love yourself is the greatest love of all.

The moon may be high
But I can't see a thing in the sky

Only man I ever think of with regret
I'd like to add his initial to my monogram

There's a somebody I'm longing to see
I hope that he turns out to be
Someone who'll watch over me
I'm a little lamb who's lost in the wood
I know I could always be good
Someone who'll watch over me

Tonight our spirits will be climbing

Misty water-colored memories of the way we were
Scattered pictures of the smiles we left behind
Smiles we gave to one another for the way we were

If we had the chance to do it all again
Tell me, would we?
Could we?

I need my love to be here

Here, making each day of the year
Changing my life with a wave of her hand

There, running my hands through her hair
Both of us thinking how good it can be
Someone is speaking, but she doesn't know he's there

I want her everywhere
And if she's beside me I know I need never care

And so did I

Just bill and coo, like love birds do
I began to envy them when suddenly
One flew away, far away just like you

Like a birdie, you flew away from the nest
Never said goodbye to me, went and left me up a tree
Don't know if you flew to the east or the west
Just know that since you have flown
I'm all alone, so depressed

If it was a blackbird or a jay
If a cuckoo bird took you from me

Well I just had to laugh
I saw the photograph.
He blew his mind out in a car
He didn't notice that the lights had changed
A crowd of people stood and stared
They'd seen his face before
Nobody was really sure
If he was from the House of Lords.

But I just had to look

Dragged a comb across my head
Found my way downstairs and drank a cup,
And looking up I noticed I was late.
Found my coat and grabbed my hat
Made the bus in seconds flat
Found my way upstairs and had a smoke,
Somebody spoke and I went into a dream

Here's what she said to me

Que sera, sera
Whatever will be, will be

When I grew up and fell in love
I asked my sweetheart 
What lies ahead
Will we have rainbows

Here's what my sweetheart said

They ask their mother
What will I be
Will I be handsome
Will I be rich
I tell them tenderly

Your eyes give the answer I'm dreaming of

To make me believe when your eyes just deceive

you gotta forget him now that he's gone, 
and remember.
 
That's The Way Love Is, baby, 
(That's The Way Love Is, sure enough how it is.)
That's The Way Love Is, sugar,
(That's The Way Love Is, sure enough how it is.)
 
The road of love gets rough some times don't let it get the best of you.
Said I've been hurt by love so many times,
so I know just what you're goin' through.
You wish that you were never born, you gotta forget him now that he's gone, 
just Remember.
 
That's The Way Love Is, baby, 
(That's The Way Love Is, sure enough how it is.)
That's The Way Love Is, sugar,
(That's The Way Love Is, sure enough how it is.)
 
Love is here today and gone tomorrow,
(That's The Way Love Is, sure enough how it is.)
All of your joys turn to sorrow,
(That's The Way Love Is, sure enough how it is.)
One day gladness next day sadness,
(That's The Way Love Is, sure enough how it is.)
 
Love is here today and gone tomorrow,
(That's The Way Love Is, sure enough how it is.)
All of your joys turn to sorrow,
(That's The Way Love Is, sure enough how it is.)
One day gladness next day sadness,
(That's The Way Love Is, sure enough how it is.)
 

",That's the Way Love Is,1975
Carl Grayson,"In some secluded rendezvous,
That overlooks the avenue,
With someone sharing a delightful chat,
Of this and that,
And cocktails for two.

As we enjoy a cigarette,
To some exquisite chansonette,
Two hands are sure to slyly meet beneath a serviette,
With cocktails for two.

My head may go reeling,
But my heart will be obedient,
With intoxicating kisses,
For the principal ingredient,

Most any afternoon at five,
We'll be so glad we're both alive,
Then maybe fortune will complete her plan,
That all began
With cocktails for two",Cocktails for Two,1989
Carl Halen,"Where's that tiger! Where's that tiger!
Where's that tiger! Where's that tiger!
Hold that tiger! Hold that tiger ! Hold that tiger! 
Choke him, poke him, kick him and soak him!
Where's that tiger? Where's that tiger?
Where oh where can he be?
Low or highbrow, they all cry now
""Please play that Tiger Rag for me""

Carl Hall,"I told you that I loved you
Time and time again
But you got me crying, baby

And my tears are flowing just like rain

Well, I'm all alone and blue as can be
And I'm walking, walking
Walking up a one way street

I would treat you, honey
I'd treat you so good
If I could I really would
And sometimes I think I should

Well, I'm all alone and blue as can be
And I'm walking, walking
Walking up a one way street

You know, it don't take much
It don't take much to please me
But every day here lately
Seems like all you do is tease me

Well, I'm all alone and blue as can be
And I'm walking, walking
Walking up a one way street

I thought one day, baby
I'd live to be your fool
Seems as though it's the other way around
And I'm walking to my doom

Well, I'm all alone and blue as can be
And I'm walking, walking
Walking up a one way street",Walkin' Up a One Way Street,2013
