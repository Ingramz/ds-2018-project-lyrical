Strictly Dope,"I lay awake tonight because I wanna be with you
If you were beside me I'd playfully kiss you
Each time I see ya, the feeling gets stronger
You sit a bit closer, we stare a lot longer
Reach for my drink and for a second we touch
Words are muttered I stutter 'cause I want you that much
The situation is a no win 'cause he's my bestfriend
But now I'm guilty, I'm fallin' for his girlfriend

I know it's wrong but my heart is filled with purity
I offer passion but he offers security
It's like a trap that I'm sinking into
I wake up sweaty when I'm sleepin' 'cause I'm thinking of you
Then we make eye contact and I can't hold back
I try to shake it but the feeling comes right back
What have I gotten into, I feel possesed by you
I have these thoughts at night of undressing you

It's kinda obvious blind men might see it
But he doesn't so he keeps on trusting me
Leaves me alone with you while he's on vacation
Well how could he leave me with this temptation
Now I'm confused 'cause I'm no Casanova
But you keep callin' you sayin' to comeover
Now what do I do? Go or stay and play it smart
It's gettin' rougher 'cause I suffer from a burnin' heart

My burnin' heart

Girl, you are my one and only
You are my angel and now you wanna leave me lonely
What did I do? Baby, did I treat you bad?
My heart is broken and now you make me sad
I remember, when this love affair first started
We was so in love and now we are departed
Girl, I buy you anything your heart desires
I have to let you know, baby, you're my fire

Warm and wet each kiss is prolonged
This sweet caress that makes Rock T strong
Just being with you and seeing the two of us
Walking along the beach 'cause, girl, you are my peach
So sweet and tender my love I surrender
No need to pretend that you want it to end
I'll never let you go you're forever my girl
You know why? 'Cause girl, you are my world

My burnin' heart

Totally tongue tied every two seconds I keep watching you
He's my best friend but I can't help clockin' you
How could this be, how could we both love you?
Now I'm trapped in this position and don't know what to do
I could forget about you, pretend that we never met
But when I'm here without you, I start to heavily sweat
You give me looks that reenforce upon the sores that's already there
So many times my mind was locked up and we passionately stare

Play the role like you don't matter, he swears that we hate each other
But in reality we can't wait to taste each other
You're my addiction 'cause I fiend for you desperatley
I stand here fantasicing because you're next to me
What can I do with this passion I feel
It's too hard to conceal so I know it's for real
Watched you so many times, I know where every curve is
I think you reads my mind and so I'm feelin' nervous

I wanna tell you how I feel but that wouldn't help
It would only cause problems so I keep to myself
Even though it drives me crazy to see you sitting with him
A tear rolls down my cheak because I see you kiss him
I know the words you're saying before they can be said
Hear the thoughts you be thinkin' before they come in your head
Wouldn't hurt the brotha for anything in this world
But damn I fell in love with his girl

My burnin' heart, heart, heart

My heart is burnin' you know it's yearin' for your sweet caress
I lay in ecstacy as you kiss and rub my chest
You know you love me why must you deny yourself
What I can offer you yet you want somebody else
It's not that well then girl what could it be
I hope I'm good for you 'cause baby, you're so good for me
Many nights I cried and tried to make this work
Then acted fool and cool and cruel like a church

Well I'm sorry baby, I have to let you know
You are my life my strength I refuse to let you go
You are so beautiful, baby, you light up my life
I close my eyes and dream that you'll become my wife
Day in and day out it's you I pray about
Don't lock the door to your heart and make me stay out
I love you 'cause honey, you're like a work of art
You got me on fire

My burnin' heart

I lay awake tonight because I wanna be with you
If you were beside me I'd playfully kiss you
Each time I see ya the feeling gets stronger
You sit a bit closer we stare a lot longer

Since I was born I was strong

'Cause I'll never be beat, never be beat, never 

Boldly you steppin to the top of the piece 
'Cause I'm the predator competitor and I'm risin like yeast 
I'm the microphone musician musically I'm the most 
When I rumble you tumble like a burnt piece of toast 
Proceed with caution I cannot be stopped 
A deadly weapon that's kept inside a Sentry lock 
Strong hold holding on but there's no holds barred 
Fuck around feel the wrath and your forever scarred 
Anybody want to battle step the hell up 
Toss your ass like a salad and eat you all up 
You climb the rope of success but you know you can't win 
You get discouraged cause I hold the otha end 
If I let you go like all the others you will fall 
The vicious vocalist consoloist will still be raw 

Your bein waxed like a sucker but you'll neva recoup 
I'm a veteran a breathren goin in like a troop 
Try to stop me you can't you puff and you pant 
Try to beat me at this game you gettin stomped like an ant 
In the long run I'm the one that's holding the mic 
Upset to get to me sweatin me for the rhymes that I write 
This time we're goin at it get ready 
'Cause I'm your worst nightmare, fuck Freddy 
Where's that mothafucker that said that I was a dope 
Tyin' up rhymes like a rope I'll pull it tight and I'll choke

'Cause I'll never be beat you punk, never 

Hard is what you wanted knowledge is what you gettin 
I'm movin and groovin and proven, you're still sittin 
Got me blowin up, like a Hawaiian vulcano 
Runnin things like Drano 
Lettin you know that there ain't no-body 
Gonna diss me now I'm comin exact 
I'm paid got it made cause I'm makin tracks 
This is a lesson at bein dope that is 
Cordless mics are mine and the wheels are his 
Tons and tons of freaks I'm a mack daddy-o 
Writin def jams while I'm chillin on my patio 
You are useless as a toothless piranha 
I'm ruthless now I'm gonna 
Bust it and discuss it make it funky to hear 
Paragraph to the people penetratin your ear 
You want to taste of it ooh here take a full dose 
Burn you up like radiation if you get too close 

'Cause my mouth is like an uzi when it moves so quick 
And my lyrics are the bullets that I'm loadin it with 
You want to beat me homeboy I think you'll be destroyed 
Get dropped like a habit and played like a toy 
Never defeated I'm not conceited but let's face the facts 
Couldn't beat me with a motherfuckin baseball bat 
If I gave you a bomb that was nuclear armed 
You could shoot it at me and I wouldn't get harmed 
'Cause punk you can't stop me bullets couldn't drop me 
Stand on a mountain and still you couldn't top me 
You think you'll beat me boy get it togetha

'Cause I'm the hip hop hood the ringleader at large 
Got a Ph.D in history

Young beat conisseur hummin like a bird 
It was true when uou heard I'm the wiz the word 
Your eyes delate your eardrums expand 
When my voice comes through speaker from the mic in my hand 
Woofers stompin like thunder all about to explode 
The needle on the nuance stuck in overload 
Don't laugh cause I'm serious Mr. Mysterious 
Don't make me wad (why) cause I get furious 
Countless time is he just when you think I'm through 
I let my melody stretch to make more for you 
Just bust it cause I'm just too clever

Ain't nothing but another calculated schemes
To get us locked up shot up back in chains
To deny us of the future rob our names
Kept my history of mystery but now I see

Cause lady liberty is a hypocrite she lied to me
Promised me freedom, education, equality
Never gave me nothing but slavery
And now look at how dangerous you made me
Calling me a mad man cause I'm strong and bold
With this dump full of knowledge of the lies you told
Promised me emancipation in this new nation
All you ever gave my people was starvation
Fathers of our country never cared for me
They kept my ancestors shackled up in slavery
And Uncle Sam never did a damn thing for me

Go toe to toe with a panther and you just can't win

The American Dream was an American nightmare
You kept my people down and refuse to fight fair
The Klu Klux Klan tried to keep us out
Besides drew they know no blacks allowed
With intimidation and segregation was a way for our freedom
But now were impatient
Blacks the other skin: dead or sell outs

My Mother never let me forget my history
Hoping I was set free chains never put on me
Wanted to be more than just free
Had to know the true facts about my history
I couldn't settle for being a statistic
Couldn't survive in this capitalistic
Government cause it was meant to hold us back
Using ignorant, drugs, to sneak attack
In my community, they killed the unity
But when I charged them, tried to claim immunity
I strike America like a case of heart disease
Panther power is running through my arteries
Try to stop oh boy you'll be clawed to death
Cause I'll be fighting for my freedom with my dying breath
Do you remember that is what I'm asking you?
You think you living free don't let me laugh at you
Open your eyes realize that you have been locked in chains
Said you wasn't civilized and stole your name
'Cause some time has passed seem you all forget

Strictly Inc.,"She was an only child
With her body and mind she had to much attention
Too much of everything
She was an angel child
But the devil within her would test her on the way

Into the dark filled places underground
She entered in forbidden rooms
Only seventeen

All alone so alone
All alone so alone

Into the tunnel and back toward the light
That shines between the fingers of dark
The light that shines showing the way to the start

She was an only child
She had so far to fall then so far to climb
To get to the light again
She was a special child
She know what was coming but she know she could not turn

Back in the dark filled rooms
One of a crowd but more than on her own

All alone so alone
All alone so alone

Into the tunnel and back toward the light
That shines between the fingers of dark
The light that shines showing the way to the start

The dance is almost done

As if we broke the bonds of earth somehow
Here for eternity
A piece of you is part of me

Strictly Inc.,"I want to tell you all about a young man
He'll be known as Dan
Then he was living down in San Diego
Drove an ice-cream van
One night he met a girl in Club Alamo
But she was strictly incognito

They had a drink and when he asked her name
She told him Jennifer
But what he didn't realize as he was
Dancing close to her
He held the body of a waitress called Kaye
Who used to live in Sacramento
They danced right through the night and into the day
Remaining strictly incognito

He drove her home in the sunlight of morning
He held her close in the car
But fourteen-year old Sara Lee was watching
She knew he'd gone much too far

Poor Dan, a simple man, he just failed to see
It wasn't Jennifer who kissed him
'Cause when Dan took her hand he held Sara Lee
She knew that she could convict him

So Dan got ten years to dream in state detention
And lost the use of his car
And all because his waitress Kaye forgot to mention
It's not always clear who we are

Now she's waiting tables in Paloma
Near the 4-0-5
And there's another twenty-eight personas
Keeping her alive
Next time your waitress looks you right in the eye
You'd better exercise your veto
And keep your mind right on that blueberry pie

Is to leave the world behind

Words of comfort, walls of sound
Unseen and secret, all around, all around

Strife,"Imperfection seems to have gotten the best of me.
I beat myself down in this frustration.
In unreal aspiration- never allowing progression to begin- sights set so far ahead.
Missing the start I fall once more.
I must try one step at a time.
Facing this path alone, I will begin again.
I will begin again.
Obstacles come from within!
Sometimes so strong you must wait.
Take the time to catch your breath.
Face the path alone and begin again...Begin again.
Never let yourself go astray!
Making a change will take some time.
But you've got the time, you've got the time.
Face the path alone- Begin again!
Face what is there- what is there.
I must realize what is there, face, confront and never give in.
I must try one day at a time.
Facing the path alone, I won't let it win.

Security once known has been stipped back and exposed. Strong
Hands which before expressed support have now faded from my sight.
Stong hands scorn my eyes to darken the light...and it just
Slips away. It burns. It burns in my heart. I thought I knew
What I was looking for. I thought I knew what I would find.
I thought I knew what would become of me. It feels like like
I knew nothing. Figure it out what's going on. Well in my heart I
Know I'm strong. Figure out what went wrong. It feels like
It took too long. Too long!

Sunday morning creeping like a nun
Monday's child has learned to tie his bootlegs

Wonders how you manage to feed the rest

See how they run

Wednesday morning papers didn't come
Thursday night you stocking needed mending
See how they run

Wonder how you manage to make ends meet",Lady Madonna,2008

This great big world to make a place you love

Open your golden gate
You let no stranger wait outside your door

Here is your wandering one 
Saying I'll wander no more
Other places only make me love you best
Tell me you're the heart of all the golden west

I'm coming home
To go roaming no more

Strings of Paris,"When they begin the beguine
It brings back the sound of music so tender
It brings back a night of tropical splendor
It brings back a memory ever green

I'm with you once more under the stars
And down by the shore an orchestra's playing
And even the palms seem to be swaying
When they begin the beguine

To live it again is past all endeavor
Except when that tune clutches my heart
And there we are, swearing to love forever
And promising never, never to part

What moments divine, what rapture serene
Till clouds came along to disperse the joys we had tasted
And now when I hear people curse the chance that was wasted
I know but too well what they mean

So don't let them begin the beguine
Let the love that was once a fire remain an ember
Let it sleep like the dead desire I only remember
When they begin the beguine

Oh yes, let them begin the beguine, please make them play
Till the stars that were there before return above you
Till you whisper to me once more, ""Darling, I love you""

Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb
Always reminding me that we're apart
You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms
The nightingale 
Tells his fairytale
Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain
My stardust melody
The memory of love's refrain.",Stardust,1996

She is cold I agree

The twists and turns, shifts and burns
Can leave you hopeless of his return

Be the gift that keeps you firm, with no remorse

And stop saying goodbye, and stop saying goodbye

You're facing frustration and intoxication
Stop saying goodbye, another location
Won't give you the answer, it has it's own cancer
Stop saying goodbye, it isn't the answer
Stop saying goodbye, stop saying goodbye
",Stop Saying Goodbye,2004
Stroke 9,"Can't take back the things you said
'Cause I won't ever forget
The one thing that I can say
I won't lie to your that face
That I'm never coming back

I tear the pages from this book
(I tear the pages from this book)
I can't steal back the love you took
(I can't steal back my love)

As the time slips by
The sun sets on this heart of mine
And it's beating this time

Another night, you go away
But in my dreams, you always stay
I hold you close until we crash
You whisper in my ear
It's all the same things you've said in the past

I tear the pages from this book
(I tear the pages from this book)
I can't steal back the love you took
(I can't steal back my love)

As the time slips by
The sun sets on this heart of mine
And it's beating this time
I swear, I wake up in another frame of mind

I see the wheels are turning on
Behind your eyes
I can't remember the last time
I saw you cry

I tear the pages from this book
I can't steal back the love you took

As the time slips by
The sun sets on this heart of mine
And it's beating this time
I swear, I wake up in another frame of mind
Next time

Toujours les mêmes discours, toujours les mêmes airs,
Hollande, Belgique, France austère.
Gauches, ou libéraux, avant-centres ou centristes,
Ça m'est égal, tous aussi démagos que des artistes.

Je ne dis pas ce que je pense, mais je pense ce que je dis.
Quand je vois ce que je vois, et ce que valent nos vies
Pas si surprenant, qu'on soit malpolis.
Donc vas-y follow ma folie, m'a follow, follow me now!

""Allez vous faire!""

Censé devenir un jeune cadre dynamique,
J'ai toujours été qu'un jeune stressé qui panique.
C'est marqué sur nos actes de naissance en italique,
On a tous un pied dans l'hôpital psychiatrique.
La nuit dans la bouteille, la journée dans les bouchons,
Depuis quand je suis dans les pompes de Monsieur Tout-le-monde?
La ville dans les oreilles, la fumée dans les poumons,
Des moutons, des moutons, des moutons
Pardonnez mon petit langage
Là j'ai bu du 10 ans d'âge
Les médias font trop de chantage
Vous m'avez pris pour un esclave?
Debout c'est l'heure du taf
Faut bien limiter la casse
De-demande à Raelsan
On va tous finir en cage!

""Allez vous faire!""

Riches, et malheureux,
Mais heureusement qu'on a l'euro.
C'est cool nan, mais si coûteux,
Que l'argent est à couper au couteau.
Et ça taf pour dépenser,
D'arrache pieds et ça pour que ça marche
Cracher, cracher du cash
Et saigner jusqu'à être balafré
C'est pour les mecs avec qui j'ai grandi pendant des années,
Sans pour autant qu'ils me renient par rapport au succès,
Tu sais bien la vie c'est paro
Pas la peine d'en faire un fromage
Demande aux tits-pe qui maraudent dans les tier-quar
J'ai rien de ssé-ca, je me casse, on se capte un de ces quatre
Allez vous faire foutre, j'ai un match de foot

""Allez vous faire!""

Montez sur scène, allez tous vous faire huer!
Marchez dans les rues, allez tous vous faire juger!
Passez sur le billard, allez tous vous faire tuner!
Signez sur des contrats, allez tous vous faire plumer!
J'allume la télé pour cracher sur des connards que je déteste
J'ai 300 chaînes, pense à la quantité d'insultes que je déverse
On dit que je fais preuve de gentillesse
Je fais vraiment preuve de faiblesse
Faudrait leur faire payer leurs dettes
Avant que je meure de vieillesse.

Choose your side and your weapon tonight

We've got to see beyond the wreck of today
It's time to leave behind the states that defined us
We've got to realize that this is our way

That something new is on the rise
And what would happen if the forces rushing in
Were to collide?

Choose your side and your weapon tonight...

And everybody knows, they know it's true
There's nothing left here now for me or for you

I know that you're so wrong

Well I dreamed this night a thousand times
But I never knew that I'd be burning inside

Raise the darkness and expose their lies
Night riders in the western skies

Burning bright like a thousand suns and

And I don't need nothing 'cause I know that I'm right
Raise the darkness and expose their lies

In the wreck of souls, well so who have you told
Call it chance or call it fate
Just remember that it's never too late

Restrict somatic delusion
Destroy prosodic illusion
Uphold evoke and desire
Absorb the voice of the fire

Can't hope to combat the motion
Can't stop the feedback devotion
Can't stop it, tried but it continues
Transcend it or be consumed

And in the wreck of failed diplomacy
Challenge order well I'll follow your lead
Just a few more steps and then you're free
But you'll never know 'cause they don't want you to see

On target and we're flying blind
And I'm scared to look because I know what I'll find
Never knew that it would end this way
Watching paradise go down in flames but
I won't give up, I won't give way
In the moment of truth I won't surrender my name
Because there's no more limits and no more fear
Because I know that the end is near

[Chorus: Butch Cassidy]
I'd leave the girl alone, but the bitch keeps callin me
All day and all night long, she just keeps callin me
She says she'll kill herself if I try to let her go
Somebody pray for me, cause I'm stuck with a crazy ho

Comin from a cat, that uhh
believe that if wasn't nobody else in the world to pimp
he'll probably pimp hisself, that's me, Suga Free

[Strong Arm Steady - 1]
Woman out the wilderness - bitch!
The homies say you got a wildabeast piece
But she a dimepiece, her mind lost, thrown off course
She been divorced twice, overwhelmed by - bad advice
from a past life, she crazy though
Call my telephone a hundred times in a row
I don't know how to let her go
I'm stuck with this ho - pardon me
But she ain't nuttin but the worst part of me
She even threatened to slice her artery
I gotta watch my God Degree
She tried to voodoo the peas and throw her eyelashes in the recipe
Please, it's more than she's spittin in my lemonade
and R. Kelly ain't got the right to sing the hook, like Butch
Yeah, c'mon, spit it

[Strong Arm Steady - 2]
Now since chickens of a feather be cluckin together
And I met her through Aiesha, I shoulda known better
She a pro-fessional charger Laker chaser
The kind that'll lie and say one of 'em raped her (trick)
But she in love with a gangsta
And it's been all trivial since the day that I janked her
Swore she wasn't ghetto but I met her at Fairmont
Shoulda knew she was a gangsta when she said that it wasn't her man's car
- but now she crazy over me
Tryin to OD, cause she can't be with me
She'll, fuck with different sets just to bring you beef
Fake a pregnancy just to get you fo' a G, crazy

[Butch Cassidy]
How much can one man take?
Worried if I leave it's her life she'll take
So I'm stuck here livin life in fear
Situation so severe
I need to change my ways
Pay more attention to her ho-pefully
Thinkin with my dick every night and day
The bitch won't go away

All in front of my house, tellin everybody you not leavin
And just beat it - you're insane

Then it's off to work thinkin how much shit I'll have to take
It's been two weeks since I've had a smile upon my face.
I miss the days when all I knew fits in it's place.

14 days - I killed myself alone
14 days - Tried so hard to understand
14 days - I'll never forgive you

My world came crashing down as if I stood aside and watched
All the monsters in my head control everything I feel
I can see the door that traps me in this place
I can see my way outta here but I just can't find the key.

14 days - I killed myself alone
14 days - Tried so hard to understand
14 days - I'll never forgive you

14 days - scaming into this space

Has life ever had a suicidal tone, 
No one wants to know me 
For they slip me out, I'm outside looking in think 

I'm under pressure while I'm here today 
But we only know the right words to say 
That has come and gone if they had only known 
They couldnt go through life alone.

tell you never to fear
In a world where we can be one so far away from here
We'll kiss the sky together amoung the stars we will play
They'll never ever find us in our castle, so far away
Well I just can't seem to forget the places that I've been

Talk about the things in life that seem so unreal as I sit away
And take another hit I smoke another bong load
And it seems I'm really lit hey I can't take no more of it,

Drink-Drink myself to sleep

Say or do won't ever change a thing

Spoken and intentions smoked away
I find myself in the same ol' shit.
The same ol' shit again
Maybe today won't be the same
Maybe I'll just stand my ground
Maybe another time another place
I'll float myself right outta here

To say I don't regret a single thing that I have done

Those that the beast is looking for

In empty burning hell - Unholy One

He finds his heaven
Spewing from the mouth of hell

Cause nothing moves you like extinction

Drown with a lost soul and maybe
The eerie glare of neon will last all night

We drone on we persist without an end 
We destroy all life around us
We are the beauty from within
And I been tortured by my place in all of this
But you assure me of my purpose 
What we are we've always been

On this eve of destruction baby

We got no where to hide
Damned with no secrets and maybe
The eerie glare of heaven will shine all night

Embrace the window as you stare into the light
We both know there's no escaping what we are
But we still persist and fight

Is anybody out there get the message that I send?
Would anybody read it then send it back again?
A call to mend connection lost through memory and bone,
A call to find a new way to communicate and grow!

Now I write my sentence on its walls

I'm calling, is anybody out there?
Is anybody tunning in?

One thousand years that I've waited for a sign
A dream may last for seconds changing you for all times
Frantic incoherent just a reach in the dark!
A message for my lonely thoughts a sparrow for my heart.

I'm calling, is anybody else out there?

With no choice I started to voice
Everything I believed
I knew you that I was the one
Who would never retreat

No, till I get what I need
No, till I get what I need
Till I get what I need

On the run and chasing the sun
Never looking behind
It ain't over till it's done
And I'm able to find
The one thing that drives me
To reach far beyond the stars
I won't break, I'm not gonna breach
Until I make my mark

No, till I get what I need
No, till I get what I need

Stryper,"A crown of thorns, it was placed on His head
They clothed him in purple and stated their case
""He is The King of the jews,"" as they slapped His face

Pilate said, ""I find no reason to charge Him""
As soon as they saw Him they said ""crucify""
He just proclaimed to be God, He surely must die

Yahweh, Yahweh, Yahweh

When Pilate heard this, he was afraid
He asked The Lord ""where do You come from?""
Don't You realize I have power to free or kill The Son?

Jesus finally decided to answer him
""You have no power at all over Me
If it didn't come from above, you're too blind to see""

Yahweh, Yahweh, Yahweh
Yahweh, Yahweh, Yahweh

And so, the soldiers took Jesus
Dragging His cross to a place where He knew
They hung a sign that would read ""The King Of The Jews""

They nailed His flesh to the wood
He said ""It's Finished"" and laid down His life
Gave up His spirit for all, He was crucified

It's evident I'm Heaven-sent with Thomas Edison elements
Reverent for what I represent to show my benevolence
This is Dilly; I'm reppin' for the art of the city
Came from Southwest Atlantic and gave my heart to the city
Where slugs fly, thugs cry 'cause every part of it's gritty
Niggas shootin' up the club like they party with Diddy
You pick the diggy; I put my incandescence to fluorescence
And an essence I convert with (?) for energy per second

Oh oh oh oh

Wanna make a nigga motto
Until they pull me off, stayin like Apolo
Yea, you tryna make me say it ah?
And at the same time I ain’t tryna to mix in
A nigga pussy then, she probably on her hands then
I’m poppin bottles with a bitch, she grab my hand then
I’m tryna beat the pussy up, I’m talkin bam bam
Uh, I thought she was the superior
Uh, I thought it’s worth it, I was going HAM
Bang it up and put it in reverse
Yea, so I can put it in a verse
Yea, your purse – I put it in a hearse
You know you ain’t even work
So when a nigga touchdown
Turn up the speakers, rolling deep for me and played your time
I made some paper but she’s really hard to match it now
To tell the truth, I really like her more than ever now

This one done got me on the road right now

A tear drops my eye

Pumping on my chest and I'm screaming
I stop breathing, damn I see demons
Dear God, I wonder can you save me
I can't die my boo boo's bout to have my baby
I think it's too late for praying, hold up
A voice spoke to me and it slowly started saying
(Bring your lifestyle to me, I'll make it better)
How long will I live?
(Eternal life and forever)
And will I be the G that I was?
(I'll make your life better than you can imagine or even dream of
So relax your soul, let me take control
Close your eyes my son)

I got my Momma and my Daddy and my homies in my corner
It's gonna take a miracle they say
For me to walk again and talk again but anyway
I get fronted some keys to get back on my feet
And everything that nigga said came to reality
Living like a baller loc
Having money and blowing hella chronic smoke
I bought my Momma a Benz, and bought my boo boo a Jag
And now I'm rolling in a nine-trizzay El Do-Rad

Cause when you start set-tripping, that ass is mine)

I pray the Lord, my soul to keep
If I should die, before I wake
I pray the Lord, my soul to take

No more indo, gin and juice
I'm on my way to Chino, rolling on the grey goose
Shackled from head to toe
Twenty-five with an izz-el, with nowhere to gizzo, I know
Them niggas from the other side recognize my face
Cause it's the O.G. D-O-double-G, L-B-C
Mad dogging niggas cause I don't care
Red jumpsuit with two braids in my hair
Niggas stare as I enter the center
They send me to a level three yard, that's where I stay
Late night I hear toothbrushes scraping on the floor
Niggas getting they shanks, just in case the war, pops off
Cause you can't tell what's next
My little homey Baby Boo took a pencil in his neck
And he probably won't make it to see twenty-two
I put that on my Momma; I'ma ride for you Baby Boo

As he carried you away
From your father's hand

Reaching out to make you pay
He came like a hero from the factory floor
With the sun and moon as gifts
But the only son you ever saw
Were the two he left you with
Oh Lord where did the feeling go
Oh Lord I never felt so low
Now the skirts hang so heavy around your head
That you never knew you were young
Because you played chance with a lifetime's romance
And the price was far too long

It tells me where you've been through
I watch the way the sun sets
Until the night's inside you

Some days I need to bury the very depths of me
So out here to the east of Eden
I let salvation be
I was waiting, I was watching
Would it ever be there for me
And I found that hope and a lucky card
Were all I had to walk with me
Had to walk with me
I watch the way the crow flies
I know it always seems so easy
But if I see it in a grey sky
Can I be sure about the way it leads me
Some days I just don't worry, I let it walk through me
Some days I call upon the very depths of me
So out here to the east of Eden
I watch your soul run free
I was waiting, I was watching
Would it ever be before me
And I found that hope and a lucky card
Were all I had to walk with me
I was waiting, I was watching
Would it ever be before me
And I found that hope and a lucky card
Were all I had to walk with me
Some days will stay a thousand years
Some pass like the flash of a spark
Who knows where all our days go
Out here we lie together
Outside the thunder gathers
Why care about the weather
It always ends in dark
I looked west in search of freedom and I saw slavery
I looked east in search of answers and I saw misery
Some days I just don't worry, I let it walk through me
Some days I walk into the very depths of me
So out here to the east of Eden

She only needed three cords to play those good ole country songs 
And her name's etched in the finish like a fading battle scar

I wonder if she played it in a small town talent show
With her hair teased to perfection in a dress her mama sewed
And for a little inspiration she pasted on a star
Here up on the head stock of Emma Jean's guitar

Stuart Murdoch,"I'm bored out of my mind
Too sick to even care
I'll take a little walk
Nobody's going to know
I'm in Senior Ward
That gives you a little free time
I'll just use it all at once

Took the fence and a lane
The bus then the train
Bought an Independent to make me look like
I got brains
I made a story up in my head
If anybody would ask
I'm going to a seminar

I'm a genius
I'm a prodigy
A demon at maths and science
I'm up for a prize
If you gotta grow up some time
You have to do it on your own
I don't think I could stand to be stuck
That's the way that things were going

The Bible's my tool
There's no mention of school
My Damascene Rose
A transistor radio
I tune in at night
When my mum and my dad start to fight
I put on my headphones

And I tune out
I am devout
The girls are singing about my life
But they're not here they've got the wild life
If you want to find out, find out
You've got to look them in the eye
That's why my only choice
Is find the face behind the voice",Act of the Apostle,2014
Stuart Murdoch,"Come Monday night the day of work is done
Tuesday morning lose the grey of ordinariness
Start by putting off your chores
And all the crushing bores
Say your morning prayers
Sing a rousing song
Then sing it on the long walk home

Come Monday night we're in a state of praise
Twenty-million boys are caught up in a paper chase
If the weekend promised much
Then it failed to touch
On a single count what I was hoping for
What i was hoping for

Come Monday night we turn the telly off
To listen to the silence
Light that comes in from outside
If you could catch it all
And pin it to your wall

Then you would sleep much better
Baby you would sleep much better
Maybe you would sleep much better

Stuart Murdoch,"I fried my head, I'm not a brunette
I'm a down and dusky blonde
I am living in a tree
When I lie in bed I see
Beyond my lover's head the moon, I hear the rain

I am conscious of my voice as a tool
It's more demure
Than your friend the singing queen
With her matinee good looks
She talks like talking from a book
I speak the language of my village, of my street

But I need a friend and I choose you
I tell you the way I feel
The truth is crushing like a heel
I will forget the kiss and feel if you will too

Tell me tales of punk rockin' girls
It's a dim and distant page
But I mostly blame my age
Please make allowances for me
I do not see

It's a drag that you're getting old
I love to think about the year
When we sobbed and then we cheered
The town deserted like a film
The sun was baking dust for fun
Trees were withering by the day
Your torso crushing me
Into the country and the tunnels and the fields

But I need a friend and I choose you
I tell you the way I feel
The truth is crushing like a heel
I will forget the kiss and feel if you will do

I read a book a day, like an apple
But I did not eat
And so the doctor came to me
He said a woman does not live
By the printed word
Forgive yourself and eat

Autumn sped along outside
Trick photography on speed
I was locked inside a room
They made a deal, they would control
The simple things like bodies
But I kept my soul

When I needed someone I chose you
Because the fledgling soul awakes
And on the balcony she quakes
And she is waiting for the sign
And when the brother does not come
And when the sister's much to you, she chooses you",Down and Dusky Blonde,2014
Stuart Murdoch,"There is no way I'm looking for a boyfriend
There is no way I'm looking for a scene
I need to save some dough
I'm a working girl, you know
I'll fend attention off I keep to myself

I love my room, I'm getting used to sleeping
Some nights I really like to lie awake
I hear the midnight birds
The message in their words
The dawn will touch me in a way a boy could never touch
Their promise never meant so much to me

You have been warned, I'm warned to be contrary
Backward at school, I wrote from right to left
Teacher never cared for me
Preacher said a prayer for me
God help the girl, she needs all the help she can get

I sit for hours just waiting for his phone call
I'll leave the chocolate hidden in the fridge
I'll play his messages
Analyze his intonation
Please stop me there, I'm even boring myself

I think of him when I'm doing the dishes
I think of him while looking in the sink
This ain't no play on words
My love for him is absurd
If he gave me a sign I'd think about it for a week
I'd build it up and then I'd turn him down

But the sun's in the south
I'm just waking up
To the news of my birth
I am a girl and I'm lucky to be here
Whatever that's worth

Like an ostrich I lived
With my head in the sand
Slipped into corners
Sat on my hands
I learnt to stifle shouts and outrage
And feeling deep down

With my chains falling off
And the hope in a friend
Cafes and walkways
And sculptured weekends
I'm getting to love my freedom
I'm getting to like my surroundings

My room faces north
But the sun's in the south
You are far out of reach
Could I be any worth
To some special person?
My mind is unknowing
Of any such love

So I yell out the window
Answer the mail
My diary's quiet
The definitive nail
In my social coffin
I blame all the boffins
For making me fail

For an hour in the park
Or an hour on the couch
With the boy of my choice
If he makes me go ""ouch!""
I will swap all my dumb school prizes
I am open to dark surprises

My room faces north
But the sun's in the south
You are far out of reach
Perfect hand, perfect mouth
The boredom, the freedom
The train on the meadow

I don't want the drama
I just want your jeans

Stuart Murdoch,"Just another Saturday
The boys are dressed up fine
Think I'll wait 'till half past eight
To dress myself divine
Ten thirty, I'm in rags
A slutty look accompanies my questionable gaze
Through the strobe light and the haze

Take an interest in me
Why must I beg for a drink?
Too verbose
You come too close, Sir
Please step back and think
That's the trouble

Rarely does the dream boy come along
He don't exist
A lover with the candour of a friend

I run away
They're playing a decent song at last
I think I'll have to dance with Cassie
'Cause the dream boy never asked
Shuffle to the left
I kick the boy behind to make a little room
Boogie to the right
Cassie dances madly like a boxing kangaroo
Her little Joey buys the drinks
He's in love more than he thinks

They know the dance too well
The bodies heavenly
Move around the autumn sky
With measured dignity
But my Venus and my Mars
Are set to flash
The lover will lay down his sword and swear
He don't exist

and came here for adventure.
I stepped on a stone on the way.
I took off my shoe
and a dog came towards me

Dog, if you could speak,
you'd know what to do.
Simply turn around and run.

Writing home to tell you folks
About the silly ways
Are nagging at you

As transparent as a ray

Ride the wave

And confessions of loss

He is my light, my strength, my song
This cornerstone, this solid ground,
Firm through the fiercest drought and storm.
What heights of love, what depths of peace,
When fears are stilled, when strivings cease!
My comforter, my all in all
Here in the love of Christ I stand.

In Christ alone, Who took on flesh,
Fullness of God in helpless babe!
This gift of love and righteousness,
Scorned by the ones He came to save.
'Til on that cross as Jesus died,
The wrath of God was satisfied
For ev'ry sin on Him was laid
Here in the death of Christ I live.

There in the ground His body lay,
Light of the world by darkness slain
Then bursting forth in glorious day,
Up from the grave He rose again!
And as He stands in victory,
Sin's curse has lost its grip on me
For I am His and He is mine
Bought with the precious blood of Christ.

No guilt in life, no fear in death
This is the pow'r of Christ in me
From life's first cry to final breath,
Jesus commands my destiny.
No pow'r of hell, no scheme of man,
Can ever pluck me from His hand

And today's the day, that she's goin' to glory
She's goin' to glory, for the way she sinned

Stuck Mojo,"Brothers and sisters, we live in a troubled time.
We live in a time when lack of ability and talent is mistaken for genius.
When jumping on the bandwagon is considered originality.
Ahh, we live in a time when a world intended, much needed musical revolution
Has been weakened, perverted, polluted, until it is no more than a hideous fashion show.
A fashion show that began as a rebellion itself against corporate mainstream,
Yet today it finds itself to be the very mainstream that it claimed to be alternative to.
While the bands who would before criticize arena rock stars now find themselves arena rock stars!
What was once the antidote has now become the poison.
The cure has become the disease.
Ahh, let the church sing.

And we're spinning with the stars above
You lift me up with your wave of love

Studio 99,"Can you hear the drums Fernando?
I remember long ago another starry night like this
In the firelight Fernando
You were humming to yourself and softly strumming your guitar
I could hear the distant drums
And sounds of bugle calls were coming from afar

They were closer now Fernando
Every hour every minute seemed to last eternally
I was so afraid Fernando
We were young and full of life and none of us prepared to die
And I'm not ashamed to say
The roar of guns and cannons almost made me cry

There was something in the air that night
The stars were bright, Fernando
They were shining there for you and me
For liberty, Fernando
Though I never thought that we could lose
There's no regret
If I had to do the same again
I would, my friend, Fernando
If I had to do the same again
I would, my friend, Fernando

Now we're old and grey Fernando
And since many years I haven't seen a rifle in your hand
Can you hear the drums Fernando?
Do you still recall the frightful night we crossed the Rio Grande?
I can see it in your eyes
How proud you were to fight for freedom in this land

How I hate to spend the evening on my own

Blowing outside the window as I look around the room

There's not a soul out there
No one to hear my prayer

Though it's hurting me, now it's history.
I've played all my cards and that's what you've done too,
Nothing more to say, no more ace to play.
The winner takes it all,
The loser standing small beside the victory, that's her destiny.
 
I was in your arms thinking I belonged there,
I figured it made sense, building me a fence,
Building me a home, thinking I'd be strong there,
But I was a fool, playing by the rules.
The gods may throw a dice, their minds as cold as ice, 
And someone way down here loses someone dear.
 
The winner takes it all, the loser has to fall,
It's simple and it's plain, why should I complain.
 
But tell me, does she kiss like I used to kiss you,
Does it feel the same when she calls your name.
Somewhere deep inside you must know I miss you,
But what can I say, rules must be obeyed.
The judges will decide the likes of me abide,
Spectators of the show always staying low.
 
The game is on again, a lover or a friend,
A big thing or a small, the winner takes it all.

Times a happening melody equals a jam

Yet a moonbeam on the water

We recall them in days after

Her only answer is one little smile,

It could never have been me
I did not shoot no deputy

Mr Grant, the deputy,
Friend to my whole family
He always tell me when John Brown
Was getting ready to come around

Don't blame me
Don't blame me

I hide it all except a few seeds
And make him think I plant for me
When Mr Grant and I know all the while
We've got enough for the whole island

Three years now we sell it in town
Under the bucket that goes down
No one knew of it but three:
Mr Grant, Davis and me

Don't blame me
Don't blame me

I swear by God it is a plot;
Davis sent me here to rot
Listen people, can't you see
Mr Davis shot the deputy

Don't blame me
Don't blame me

Don't blame me
Don't blame me",Can't Find My Way Home,2003
Stuffy Shmitt,"When we are dancing and you're dangerously near me 
I get ideas, I get ideas 
I want to hold you so much closer than I dare to 
I want to scold you 'cause I care more than I care to 

And when you touch me and there's fire in every finger 
I get ideas, I get ideas 
And after we have kissed goodnight and still you linger 
I kinda think you get ideas too 

Your eyes are always saying the things you're never saying 
I only hope they're saying that you could love me too 
For that's the whole idea it's true, 
The lovely idea that I'm falling in love with you",I Get Ideas,2003
Stuffy Shmitt,"
I'm in love,
I'm in love,
I'm in love with a girl,
That's what's the matter with me  
I'm in love, 
I'm in love, with a beautiful girl, 
But she don't give a darn about me
to make her love me I tried,
How I sighed and I cried 
But she just refused 
And ever since she's gone away,
I've got those lovesick blues
 
Got the feeling called the ""blue hoo's,"" 
since my sweetie said ""Good Bye""
Seems I don't know what to ""Do Hoo""
All day long I sit and cry
That last long day we spent alone 
I'm yearning for it yet 
She thrilled me, filled me,
with a kind of lovin',
I never will forget, the way she called me sweet daddy"" 
Twas just a beautiful dream
 
I hate to think that it's all over I lost my heart  it seems
I got so used to her somehow
But I'm no body's baby 
Now, gee it's awful when you're lonesome 
and get those lovesick blue-oo-oo-oo-oo's

Stuffy Shmitt,"I never drink in the afternoon
I never drink alone
But I sure do like a drink or two
When I get home

Let me tell you what I do
I sit here in this chair
I pour myself some whiskey
And watch my troubls vanish into the air

[Chorus]
Rollin', rollin'
Ain't gonna worry no more
Rollin', rollin'
Ain't gonna worry no more

Used to worry about gamblin'
Throwin' my money away
Used to worry about wastin' time
And layin' round the house all day

But I'm all right now
I'm all right now
I never thought I'd make it
But I always do somehow
I'm all right

[Chorus]",Rollin',2003
Stuffy Shmitt,"
Scotch and soda, mud in your eye, 
Baby, do I feel high, 
Oh me, oh my, do I feel high.

Dry martini, jigger of gin, 
Oh, what a spell you've got me in, 
Oh my, do I feel high.

People won't believe me, 
They'll think that I'm just braggin'
That I could feel the way I feel, 
And still be on the wagon. 

All I need is one of your smiles, 
Sunshine of your eyes, oh me, oh my, 
Do I feel higher than a kite can fly!
Give me lovin', baby, I feel high.

Stun Gun,"Ziggy played guitar, jamming good with Weird and Gilly,
And the spiders from Mars. He played it left hand
But made it too far
Became the special man, then we were Ziggy's band

Now Ziggy really sang, screwed up eyes and screwed down hairdo
Like some cat from Japan, he could lick 'em by smiling
He could leave 'em to hang
'Came on so loaded man, well hung and snow white tan.

So where were the spiders, while the fly tried to break our balls
With just the beer light to guide us,
So we bitched about his fans and should we crush his sweet hands?

Ziggy played for time, jiving us that we were voodoo
The kid was just crass, he was the nazz
With God given ass
He took it all too far but boy could he play guitar

Making love with his ego Ziggy sucked up into his mind
Like a leper messiah
When the kids had killed the man I had to break up the band.

To love again

Driving in tears like on be me
I will soon be
Free from to change vow this pain inside
And the why cried
I won't be long
'Til I begin the strength to know, I can go on
I will find my way
Through the heartbreak
I will not give up for love, I believe

I will learn to love again
I will learn to trust
Once this heart can start to mean
I will learn to, learn to love again

All of these tears
Time will drive in
I will survive in
And make it through into another day
All of this pain
Time will heal it
There'll be a time, sometime I know, I won't feel it
How live through
Like without you
After the hurting is gone
I believe

I will learn to love again
I will learn to trust
Once this heart can start to mean
I will learn to, learn to love again

And I'll find someone
Who deserves my touch
After all the hurt is through
I will be so over you
I will not give up for love, I believe
Yeah

I will learn to trust
Once this heart can start to mean

Stunt Nuts,"It's like a jungle sometimes
It makes me wonder how I keep from goin' under

Broken glass everywhere
People pissin' on the stairs, you know they just don't care
I can't take the smell, can't take the noise
Got no money to move out, I guess I got no choice
Rats in the front room, roaches in the back
Junkies in the alley with a baseball bat
I tried to get away but I couldn't get far
Cause a man with a tow truck repossessed my car

[Chorus]
Don't push me cause I'm close to the edge
I'm trying not to lose my head
It's like a jungle sometimes
It makes me wonder how I keep from goin' under

Standin' on the front stoop hangin' out the window
Watchin' all the cars go by, roarin' as the breezes blow
Crazy lady, livin' in a bag
Eatin' outta garbage pails, used to be a fag hag
Said she'll dance the tango, skip the light fandango
A Zircon princess seemed to lost her senses
Down at the peep show watchin' all the creeps
So she can tell her stories to the girls back home
She went to the city and got so so seditty
She had to get a pimp, she couldn't make it on her own

[Chorus]

It's like a jungle sometimes
It makes me wonder how I keep from goin' under

My brother's doin' bad, stole my mother's TV
Says she watches too much, it's just not healthy
All My Children in the daytime, Dallas at night
Can't even see the game or the Sugar Ray fight
The bill collectors, they ring my phone
And scare my wife when I'm not home
Got a bum education, double-digit inflation
Can't take the train to the job, there's a strike at the station
Neon King Kong standin' on my back
Can't stop to turn around, broke my sacroiliac
A mid-range migraine, cancered membrane
Sometimes I think I'm goin' insane
I swear I might hijack a plane!

[Chorus]

It's like a jungle sometimes
It makes me wonder how I keep from goin' under

My son said, Daddy, I don't wanna go to school
Cause the teacher's a jerk, he must think I'm a fool
And all the kids smoke reefer, I think it'd be cheaper
If I just got a job, learned to be a street sweeper
Or dance to the beat, shuffle my feet
Wear a shirt and tie and run with the creeps
Cause it's all about money, ain't a damn thing funny
You got to have a con in this land of milk and honey
They pushed that girl in front of the train
Took her to the doctor, sewed her arm on again
Stabbed that man right in his heart
Gave him a transplant for a brand new start
I can't walk through the park cause it's crazy after dark
Keep my hand on my gun cause they got me on the run
I feel like a outlaw, broke my last glass jaw
Hear them say ""You want some more?""
Livin' on a see-saw

[Chorus]

It's like a jungle sometimes
It makes me wonder how I keep from goin' under

A child is born with no state of mind
Blind to the ways of mankind
God is smilin' on you but he's frownin' too
Because only God knows what you'll go through
You'll grow in the ghetto livin' second-rate
And your eyes will sing a song called deep hate
The places you play and where you stay
Looks like one great big alleyway
You'll admire all the number-book takers
Thugs, pimps and pushers and the big money-makers
Drivin' big cars, spendin' twenties and tens
And you'll wanna grow up to be just like them, huh
Smugglers, scramblers, burglars, gamblers
Pickpocket peddlers, even panhandlers
You say I'm cool, huh, I'm no fool
But then you wind up droppin' outta high school
Now you're unemployed, all non-void
Walkin' round like you're Pretty Boy Floyd
Turned stick-up kid, but look what you done did
Got sent up for a eight-year bid
Now your manhood is took and you're a Maytag
Spend the next two years as a undercover fag
Bein' used and abused to serve like hell
Til one day, you was found hung dead in the cell
It was plain to see that your life was lost
You was cold and your body swung back and forth
But now your eyes sing the sad, sad song
Of how you lived so fast and died so young so

Sturgill Simpson,"Decided to write a song for my hero
Considering he's done so much for me
He's the one that pulled me up when I fell down so low
He's the one that led me through the darkness when I could not see
Never met a man more gentle or any humbler
Never once heard him raise his voice or saw him mad
But I watched him break his back on coal and lumber
To give her everything she never had

'Cause when it all comes down to zero
There's nothing more this life could ever give
And I know I'll never find another hero
Not another one like him

Born on a summer day in some dark holler
Way back in the hills of Perry County
Well he grew up poor and he never saw a dollar
But a dollar ain't no good in a coal camp anyway

'Cause when it all comes down to zero
There's nothing more this life could ever give
And I know I'll never find another hero
Not another one like him

And if I'm half the man he is when I die
I don't know if I could ask for too much more
He taught me you only need one hand
To count your real friends in this life
But if you find true love you better take both arms
And hold on 'til you're sore",Hero,2013
Sturgill Simpson,"I'd have to be crazy 
To stop all my singing
And never play music again

Your voice might be too genuine and your song's a little too sincere
Can you sing a little more about outlaws and the way things used to be

Sturgill Simpson,"Hello, my son
Welcome to earth
May not be my last
But you'll always be my first

Wish I'd done this ten years ago
But how could I know
How could I know
That the answer was so easy

I've been told you measure a man
By how much he loves
When I hold you
I treasure each moment I spend
On this earth, under heaven above

Grandfather always said God's a fisherman
And now I know the reason why

And if some times daddy has to go away
But please don't think that it means I don't love you
Oh, how I wish I could be there everyday
'Cause when I'm gone it makes me so sad and blue
And holding you is the greatest love I've ever known
Oh, when I get home it breaks my heart
Seeing how much you've grown, all on your own, oh

Oh, hearing that 
Made me cry
It made me cry

Sturgill Simpson,"One day you wake up
And this life will be over
Every party must break up
For burdens to shoulder
We're dying to live
Living to die
No matter what you believe
And all of us cry
For the ones we must leave

So go and live a little
Bone turns brittle
And skin withers before your eyes
Make sure you give a little
Before you go to the great unknown in the sky

Some will beg for forgiveness
From someone above
For something they did
To someone they love
Some scream like a baby
Some go out crying
Some bid the world goodbye
And welcome to die

Go out and live a little
Bone turns brittle
And skin withers before your eyes
Make sure you give a little
Before you go to the great unknown in the sky",Brace for Impact (Live a Little),2016

Always searching for tomorrow yet to come
Never thought I would see again

Coming there to take you from the light
Can't you hear me calling, calling for you baby?
So you better take on to the night, I'm the rising son

But now it's your time to live the nightmare all through
Never thought I would run again, run free across the lands

Style of Five,"My life has been a tapestry of rich and royal hue,
An everlasting vision of the ever-changing view.
A wondrous woven magic in bits of blue and gold
A tapestry to feel and see, impossible to hold.

Once, amid the soft, silver sadness in the sky,
There came a man of fortune, a drifter passing by.
He wore a torn and tattered cloth around his leathered hide,
And a coat of many colors, yellow, green on either side.

He moved with some uncertainty, as if he didn't know
Just what he was there for, or where he ought to go.
Once he reached for something golden, hanging from a tree,
And his hand came down empty.

Soon within my tapestry, along the rutted road,
He sat down on a river rock and turned into a toad.
It seemed that he had fallen into someone's wicked spell,
And I wept to see him suffer, though I didn't know him well.

As I watched in sorrow, there suddenly appeared
A figure, gray and ghostly, beneath a flowing beard.
In times of deepest darkness, I've seen him dressed in black.
Now my tapestry's unraveling; he's come to take me back.
He's come to take me back.

Cause I burn eternal, mixed wit the inferno
So be careful, 'fore I burn you
You better learn dude, yeah I heard you 
but I'ma hurt you, but you don't know?
My versatile, is a virtue
Ruff Ryders be the team, which means
a lot cream, lot of schemes 
Lot of beams to make your stock drop, right on the seams
Nigga here is too hot and too much for you to touch
Better tell your man cause I'm too tough 
Indubitably, too dust
Do you bust?  Cause we do
You need to ask the people, but quietly
But they don't believe until they leave violently 
Is you buying this?
Cause niggaz that purchased is under the dirt kid
They call me Drag-On; I'm the youngest but get bonkers
Collabo' wit my dogs from Yonkers
but this Bronx bomber's spittin flame
so you better wear your armor
Flame on!

My dogs gon' STOP, your dogs gon' DROP
And then we gon' SHUT EM DOWN, OPEN UP SHOP

When I pop up, I lock shop up, pull the drop up 
Park a block up, hit the alarm, put the top up
Stash the 'dro in my sock then pull my sock up
And keep the burner but if it's hot put my glock up 
You know what I'm about, slidin off get my cock sucked
Or writin rhymes watching Scarface in the hot tub
Whatchu wanna bet, when I pull it out
if you don't shout that every bullet'll go in and out
Who you know besides 'Kiss take the piss in the bottle of Crist'
and then give it to a modelin bitch 
And you like your watch plain, I'ma flood mine
Alligator bloodline trained to find coke and bite one time

Y'all niggaz ain't hearin me out, til I pop up 
appear in your house, clearin it out, holiday style
Everybody actin violent and wild 
Snatch the wife silence the child, that's how we move
Kill me my man kill you, that's how you lose
I Ruff Ryde, I don't like to slide felt that I slipped
Then the gun's only helpin the clip
And the clip's only helpin my hand
And like who the fuck is helpin your man?
When I cock back and hop out the van 
Double R, get a job, play the shit in the car
Hit a party start a fight at the bar, and snatch your R
Sell your shit for some coke and get the fuck out of Dodge

Guess you figured that my niggaz, flippers, pullin triggers
News team crowd around, tryin to flick a picture
Get witcha, this bitch from Illadelph marches quicker
Nigga not makin sense better stay up off the liquor
Blonde bombshell, car-a-mel, heavy spender 
Groups be sayin I'm they sister, hush ya mouth 'fore I hit ya 
Stickin in wiseguys, fake thugs, and bullshitters
Take you for a ride, cover up your eye, then I get ya 
Used to be shy-er, now I'ma Ruff Ryder

Remember me from up North, I had you scared to cough
My name is ringin bells, in penitentiary cells
I'm making thugs rebel, ain't hard to tell
You never really wanted it, so the mic you jumped in front of it
Outta sixteen shots I'ma hit, which one of you niggaz am I gonna get
Thought you knew what I was gonna spit, this time with this rhyme
but by the end of it, y'all niggaz is gon' be like, ""Yo X ripped it!""
Did my thing as usual it's never gon' stop
Them cats can't be for real, I got this shit locked!

[Styles Paniro]
You heard it from the P, you oughta know it's the truth
I get you kidnapped and raped and thrown off a roof
You could nod your head to this like it's only a rap
'Cause when these bullets hit yo' ass I'm like it's only a gat

I need a funeral to feel good, I'm hopin it's yours
Think he religious? Heard he got shot in the cross
Holiday Styles, bitch I broke most of the laws
Fuck with the Porsche or flip to the boots, stick to the truth

Do anything it takes just to get me this loot
And missin' a tooth, but both of 'em chipped, toaster is gripped
You heard about the trouble, I start most of the shit
When I squeeze ain't no controllin' the wrist

And niggas leave the room when they hear the P flowin to Swizz
I'm an ignorant and negative nigga
I sell crack, bust guns, pop shit, and say I'm better than niggas
You think not, I'll look at your man and level a nigga

If you think a rapper's better why don't you give me his name
So I can run up on him, tear him up and give you his frame
When it comes to the streets, I'm the nigga to call
Five eight and three quarters, but I'm bigger than why'all

If I left the gun home, I'ma give you the sword
I'm the devil in the flesh, I can't give you the Lord
It don't make no sense for you to pray for your life
I got my niggas in the crib, you oughta pray for your wife

[Chorus: Jadakiss and Styles]
Jadakiss: Uh huh, HOLIDAY
Styles: I gotta make it to heaven for goin through hell

[Styles Paniro]
Yo..
I do it all for my niggas, even ride wit a bomb
Get shot, die in his arm, and give him my last
It's a million dollar bail, I'ma get it in cash

I sell crack like it's '88, I live in the past
You know the P carry the gun, live in the Maz'
Tell niggas show me the money and gimme the stash
I like Malibu and pineapple, fifties of hash

Hundreds of 'dro, wear my clothes a week in a row
Sleep on the floor, catch me right next to the dog
I'm Holiday Styles, and that's what the weaponry for
And I probably won't blow for the fact that I'm hard

But I'm good with ten million in the back of the car
Either that or get life and lift the rack in the yard
Gettin' jewels from the old timers, stashin the cards
But jail ain't part of the plans

I keep weight on the scale 'cause I feel I get further with grams
In my last few bars, I run through niggas like my last few cars
And crash 'em up, the boy mighta went platinum but don't gas him up
I get his length and his width and get his casket cut

I don't deal with the snakes and fakes
But I deal with the comas and wakes, I don't make mistakes
Double are now bitch you oughta know I'ma ghost
Blow up your face, blow up the coke, and blow up the smoke

[Chorus]",Holiday,2000
Styles,"[Drag-On]
Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!
Fuck why y'all niggas talking 'bout huh? (it's time I see you)
Get it right, you fagot niggas heard Suge Knight
Double are's the only niggas he respect and, why y'all niggas shook right?
Why y'all get on Hot 97 and, talk wit a baritone
Wit two niggas downstairs with licensed guns to take why y'all home
Scared ass niggas, you think they going take a life so they can get life [nope]
Ask Puff they ain't trying to hear that nigga
For no cake, and why y'all can get at us on Labor Day
We make stones that say ? your moms labor day
I'm in the hood so we can link up, any place you think of
Hand held don't hold prints plus I burnt the tip of my fingers
I'm a Bronx gangsta nigga, double are's hoodrat
The nigga they come get quick bitch, on this hood shit

[Cross]
Why y'all bitches think the riders a joke, well I don't play (let's go)
I blow you whole fucking shit up like Tim McVeigh
Gimme the needle, not tomorrow, but today
Cross coming why y'all better get the fuck out the way
I ain't the shit that you see that's on the top of your church
I put a bomb in your baby carriage, brick through your hearse

[Infa-Red]
Tell your CEO, don't call my CEO apologizing (sorry)
I'm at your wake in the choir standing harmonizing
It's Infa-Red the shit that be on top of the heater
The best thing in New York since Steinbrenner signed Jeter
Hold Camby sister the hostage, then send 'em a reef
So stop fronting vegetarian just scared of beef

[Eve]
Yo, hey suck my dick bitch, the way this chick spit ridiculous
Here we go again, only we on Kiss shit
We coming and you keep running
You keep claiming you the best that done it
Pussy let me see something
Fake niggas screaming ""Ryde or Die""
Same niggas we run up on and make 'em cry
Outta all the camps in this game, nigga
We the champs in this game
Who kick the real shit before the fame
Fuck you fat ass, fake bad ass niggas
Still play the hood while you ride past niggas
Coward trust me, we keep it gutter
Hope you stay mad a hater 'cause you can't touch us, huh

""It's time I see you""

[Styles]
Hey yo, I ain't got a care in the world
Kidnapping your kid, maiming your mom, and airing your girl
And like, you ain't got a care in the world
I'm hopeless and numb, I can't see but I can focus my gun
And I'm down for smoking blunts to the head
My nerves is shot, my paces is short, I dump in your head
I'm the hardest nigga out you outta know it by now
I'm the nigga that they talk about going to Chao
And my name ring bells, my blade stay bloody
If you heard about me beefing dog I leave the most shells
The nigga to salute, the quickest to shoot
Holiday Styles, motherfucker, giving you pound

[Sheek]
What? Like I won't run up and break your jaw
Like they make a vest for your head to stop the 4
I'm tired of rapping, let's get the mack and send niggas on vacation
Right in front of the radio station
Motherfuckers ain't quiet til the tech go off
Arteries hitted, hawkin, they neck is shit
I'm the motherfucking hardest
I smack the shit out of any one of your artists
Whatever the label
Why y'all niggas don't want beef, why y'all want meat at the table
And I don't give a fuck, Sheek'll do life in the box
Before any of why y'all bitch niggas front on the LOX
What? Motherfuckers, see man

[Jadakiss]
Yo, If I miss your head and your neck, I'll hurt your chest
If you from the streets betrayal is worse than death
And I'm known for getting money, not known for wildin
But I'm real I could rock both phones in the island
This is how we even the bets
I kill everything you love dog, right now, even the pets
Everything got dubs on it, even the vets
50 close, then 50 wide, even the sets
Cause the bullets is like calisthenics when I'm squirting
When they start hurting, that means they working
Only way we coming is hard
Industry is like jail nigga, double are's running the yard, uh",It's Time I See You,2001
Styles,"[Styles]
It's sorta like the Holy Trinity
I'ma say
I say it's like three different guns you fucking fagots
Get shot three different ways
Matter fact, make that six different ways
Gun in each hand bitch
None of y'all better
""Ain't none of y'all better""
If it is name it
We'll squash you, ASAP, feel it

All I know, niggas give me all my dough
Like Boston George coming through with all my blow
Right now I'm trying to charter a jet
Fuck this hit the Panama Canal and get a harder connect
Step on your toes, mess with your hoes, shoot up your mans
Come through the block trying to screw up your plans
Cause I still rob niggas for coke
Understand I'm the first one they call when they gettin the dope
I'm the one who prick your finger when they give you the oath
I'm the one who made the hit when they bring you the toast
Like Pacino and DeNiro 'cept they call me Paniro
Sad Styles still spin that arrow, fuck it
Like the boss of New York, you know how I feel
Kill a motherfucker cause a corpse don't talk (no doubt)
Sixteen in the joint wit one in the head
If the bullets had legs have them run in your head, bitch

[Chorus]
Int none of y'all better
What y'all know about
Put in my work
On the block
Aint none if y'all better
But you know it's all real
Is it real? Yeah son!
Aint none of y'all better
What y'all know about
Put in my work
On the block
Aint none of y'all better
""bet you know it's all real
Is it real? Yeah son!
Ain't none of y'all better

[Sheek]
Let's get it popping my nigga
Load the tech up and go shopping my nigga
And I don't mean the mall or no Gucci store
You know what the fuck I want, bricks of raw
And I'm too old to make less than a hundred a year
If it means waving the hammer and leaving you there
If it means grabbing your kids out daycare
Somebody losing a seed, pay or bleed
It's Sheek Louch, I ain't got no heart
I shoot broad daylight right in front of the mark
I put 28 holes through the icy car
Fuck around, like the God won't squeeze
If I don't see the badge I'm clapping the D's
LOX motherfucker, the OX motherfucker
The reason why you shouldn't cop drops motherfucker
Like it's something for me to shoot your pops motherfucker, what

[Chorus]

[Jadakiss]
Ayo the dopes and the rice, the cokes and the Pyrex
Over the stove and I'm bout to hit it with the ice
Runners love to pump the bomb
They know no fair ones, now niggas'll jump they moms
You god, minus the 12 disciples
I pop up, all you see is shells and rifles
If I don't like you, I'ma kill you not fight you
I bite a little piece of your ear off like Mike do
And everybody gon' follow me now
Down eighth and an Uzi mahogany brown
Fagots want you to kill 'em in a hurry
It fucks me up, like they aint got no money to get buried
You could flip, I'll survive m'kay, motherfucker
In my block still doing twenty-five a day
Know you work out, chest and your back all nice
But the twelve gauge'll have your six pack on ice, what?

[Chorus]",None of Y'all Betta,2001
Styles,"Fuck the frail shit
'Cause when my coke come in
They gotta use the scale that they weigh the whales with

Carlssons on the jeep, Bugatti made the prototype
Hoped you'd get the picture but you just can't photo life

Determined niggas make it
Kicking down the door and we burning niggas naked

The house costs a million, sitting on the beach
And the only thing I know, if it's furnished I'mma take it

My bathtub lift up, my walls do a 360
We got the shit that the government got
Talking money then you rubbing the spot

Real niggas say that they be wilding
We on the Cayman Islands
On a yacht with our favorite albums

A bad ho and a plate of salmon
Smoking and drinking, nigga is you thinking that our fate is violent?

I love my nigga for the fact that he real
And nobody on the faculty squeal

And if you facing capital pun', pass me a gun
And I'mma give you time to run while I rapidly peel

I learned the game quickly, and I don't like to rent
So when I fly now, I bring my cars on the plane with me
In this case who's the loser?

Ran through enough coke for Castro to build schools in Cuba
Teaching kids how to read and write and use the Ruger

Motherfuckin' niggas is back, Jada and P
We got water, X, haze
Plus weight of the D
And I'm tired of hearing about old niggas that had it
And be the same old niggas that ratted (Who cares)
Talk 'bout how we hawk niggas in they fuckin' back

Gun work's official but niggas don't be wanting that
(Why?) 'Cause they puss and they mans is lame

We Soul for Real in the hood, we make Candy Rain

I could easily send you to God

But come and see me at the Plaza Hotel I might give you a job
If you can't remember the name
All you gotta do is ask the dame for the niggas that deliver the hard

We gon' make it, we gon' make it

We gon' make it

Ja- da- muah, I'll kiss you, you bitch ass nigga
Bet the hood won't miss you, you bitch ass nigga
Might find your man dead in the ocean

He be aight though

You know dead rappers get better promotion
Why we don't laugh at death, and cry at birth
Never say you can't do it 'til you try it first
Be the young niggas eager to pull it
But it's a message in everything, trust me, even a bullet
Go to war with the 8 and the pound
Think you got your ear to the street now, put your face in the ground
'Cause my shells is expensive
You'll know exactly why when you yellin' in intensive
My fellas is offensive
Lucky 'cause I got guns that crack your back
But that's not what I prefer, I manufacture crack
And niggas turn bitch when you show 'em the steel
But we know how to bid so y'all go 'head and squeal
I'm comfortable far from home
Eating right, getting good rest either on the bar or the phone
I'm the reason niggas got deals the past few years
""Sound anything like Kiss? Then sign right here!""

Yo, yo, yo, yo, yo

With the work across the street and the gun in the stall
Soon as somethin happen niggaz want to run to the law
You know the code of the streets, never run to the law
That's why I can't even run 'less I run with a four
or I walk with a three, come and talk to 'em P
You can catch me down bottom with a bird and a glock
On the block makin money where they murder a lot
Or you can catch me up top shootin dice for a yard
I'm talkin six digits, niggaz bet the house or the car
You can catch me hittin the spliff, sick in the pit
On the fiend like I'm missin my shit, they think I'm crazy
Catch me hittin your lady in my Mercedes
Bird on your baby, fuck you I'm keepin it gravy

Introducin, Beanie Sigel, tell me how you livin?

[Beanie Sigel]
Aiyyo, I've been kickin murder - since Adidas with thick strings
T.I. sweatsuits, Pumas with thick chains
Four finger rings, black belts with brass names
I was spittin flames since niggaz was pitchin change
I'm a hard knock kiddo, always played the middle
Threw flacks in the crack game, getchu if I can getchu
Since a buck, played the highway, dodgin the troop boys
Jumpin in and out of Coupes, wavin for Duke boys
Always chased a penny, copped quarter waters
Tried to make a dollar chased my pop's boss daughters
Tryin to make my name, global, in all four corners
Philly baller, gamin in all four quarters
Never worked, never will - all my hoes buy my clothes
I can't go broke, never will - all my bros buy my O's
I'm the best thing that linked up with New York since Sprewell
I murder, nuttin further - fill in the details

[Brett]
I'm here, it's over, fuck how why'all feel
When I drop, why'all gon' realize it's all real
Bein left for dead, tied up, smoke 'til I was dried up
So high up, seem like the sky ducked, high what?
Life was rough, but now it's nothin to hide
Used to click and be quick to put this gun to yo' side
Be like, ""That chain nice - I like that pal.
Matter fact {*click click*} I'd like that now.""
You've got game? Call the name, just spell the name right
Brett, one of the best rappers ever to touch a mic
It's prophecized I'd write, spit scriptures mind blowin
'til my coffin top close and heaven skies open
Fear no man's my slogan, I hope why'all believe
I'm just like you, fear nuttin human that bleeds
My mind breed two movies, six ab-lums, a hundred poems
Thirty R&B joints, I'm beyond the norm, why'all just mad
I'm just glad, got my time to shine
why'all the type to hit three hundred bars and run out of rhymes

Decapitation twenty buck-fifties and lacerations
Guerilla fam' camouflaged out in the grass waitin
to blass your nation slash like Jason and bash your face in
We ass lacin top bodies and half in the basement
Our style, cast you so bad you'll need plastic replacement
When gats is raised in, fascination blastin and blazin
Evacuation for your whole staff there's gas in the tank and
Gets back abrasions from cap grazin, defy gravitation
Pull my shit back squeeze bust it like masturbation
Hold fort, hold the blow torch, leave your soul scorched
with no remorse, the state of New York, get your shit caught
When niggaz hawk, let the fifth talk
So tell me who's the next man to flip?
I stop the beef shit, with rubber handled grips
Your candle get lit, guerilla shit feed us banana clips
The hammers hit, anything in our range we dismantle it

Let's do it

Walk wit ya nigga, hawk wit ya nigga
I came to shut it down
Ski mask and four pound
Baby grenades, we deep like baby parades
D-Block I'm goin' sharpen ya blades
Let's get it on
Videos with bullets flying through Korn
Blow! Footage turn ya camcords on
It's the underground nigga with bricks, nigga with dough
A nigga fucking all y'all chicks, you know
I'm a gangster and a gentleman too, P
I'll lay a nigga down and send his moms a bouquet for free
I could start a pet store with these birds 
I'm the rap Donald Goines with words
Still rob y'all herbs (And I came to)
Hit the club on my dick, light up a blunt
Thug a bitch out, I got the mud in the front
I got the flight jacket, came with wings
When I chase you to the roof 
Clappin' at ya ass with one of them things

[Chorus]
I gots to live by my pride
'Cause I came to Ruff Ryde or die
And I gots to shut down ya name
'Cause I came to shut down the game
And I gots to hold down this heat
'Cause I came to hold down ya streets
And I gots to make sure I drop yo ass
'Cause I came to D-Block all ya cash

Yo, I was determined to sell
And not because I'm just a bunny with a fluffy tail
Had to prove that I could live hard and spit hard
Just a bonus that I'm cute and get ya dick hard
See, I ain't never lettin' mine go
I'ma be here forever with my dogs as the time go
And I know we makin' niggas sick
We in they face everyday every way and they can't handle it
Streets choosin' Double are realest niggas out no confusion
Cats don't want it over here--have you heard
S.P. ain't for games little boy lesson learned
I suggest you stay far from my nigga's face
Hop back go hard all day in a nigga's face
You see, you cowards ain't a threat to us really
Just figured that we let you know that testin' us is silly
Good luck, y'all, naw forreal, fuck why'all

[Chorus]

I live by my pride, I could never be broke
I'ma Ruff Ryde or die catch me bein' with dope
Smokin' weed in the hoopty with the three in the coat
'Cause my ace boon-koon got a connect
Told me send a hundred bundles to the day room soon
If the shit go right, he know that it will
We'll be cash, he'll be movin' straight weight through June
But back to this rap shit who thug it the most
It'll take the whole coast just to fuck with the ghost
He done shut down the game, shit on ya name
If you ain't hold down the street or bust off ya heat
Then me and you is different, we ain't get it the same
And I represent niggas who live it, keep askin' for it

If you be knowin' that, you'll be aight

My heart goes out to the homeless and poor
And my niggas in the bing that didn't go to the board
Wit a 25 to L on your back the shit is too cold
And for the kids that didn't get they school clothes
For the gods that lost they earth
The world's a song you'll get it back you just lost your verse
It's P verse the demons, that's why I'm feenin' for weed
'cause I don't want to forfeit first
I could even bust my gun and do some office work
But I still want to off this jerk (shit)
I can't leave it out my rhymes (why)
'cause it be part of my dreams, to see 20 Porches murk
Three houses for the family, two for the niggas
When I die I was true to the niggas (true soldier)
And I never practice voodoo
But it's like Black Magic how I spit this fluid to niggas

How do you move on his way
When taking all this stress and pain
There's gotta be a better way
There's gotta be a better way yeah
If I should give up hope today
P won't you help me find my way
All I really want
Is to live my life so we can just get high yeah, yeah

Ask God when he stoppin' the pain
A fiend got a shoelace on his arm and he poppin' his vein
And the needle look dirty but I'm close to reaching thirty
And the only thing I know it's a profit to gain
I might cry but I'm still cold
I might be cold but I still cry
And bottom line I'ma still die
I can see the doors openin' now
I can see the ghost floatin' around
That's why P come down with the potenest sound
Spit the shit that'll open the ground (crack the ground)
My third eye got a horoscope (see it all)
So if you want to know my horoscope, listen to the bars I wrote
Build and destroy
Come through the strip wit, bricks of the girl and keys of the boy
'cause all I really want (what)
Was a gun and blunt, a lil money and some keys to a toy

[Chorus]

My whole life been a sacrifice
So if my nigga need my help he ain't never gotta ask me twice
I'm the nigga you could kick it wit
You gotta spot you want to rob I'm the nigga you could stick it wit
I'm in the studio, I'm droppin' pain on the beat
I'm famous indeed, but those is two differences
They tryin' to understand me, but I over stand 'em
I'm the flowin' phantom, til we blowin' random
And to my corner niggas holdin' cannons
That want the money and jewels and everything 'cause we so demanding
To the hoes that think I'm handsome
That know a gangster when she see one ma, yeah money that's the anthem
Callin' niggas like that's the ransom
You could take 'em you could leave 'em but your man ain't a happy camper
If P flowin' then that's the cancer

I bringin what she be on went, keep ya payroll big

No doubt I love her, I'ma tell you the truth

But don't' get it fucked up, and get fucked up

And she could sleep with another dude

Don't make me fuck around and show niggas
How to leave a room flat, twenty niggas dead
No money, no jewels, bullets in they head
Ain't a nigga you know could fuck with the god
I said that was just a hobby, gun bustin' the job
But the sickest niggas out is the bitchest niggas out

So go head and get your sons on me
Like I give a fuck, like I'm givin' up I got four guns on me
Get down and dirty, all by my lonely
I leave your brains on your block all around your homies
Live by the code of honor, stay holdin' armor
I treat beef like a album I promote the drama
Stay bustin' a hammer, sweatin' a smile
And I make sure these motherfuckers'll regret when I'm wildin'

You could sleep if you want, and get fucked with this toast in your ass
I'm the gangsta and a gentleman, I hope you the best
And tell you play the front seat and then choke you to death
Throw the gun to the chair try to open your chest
Get blood on the driver's face, window and dash
Burn the car with the body in it, bring you to ash
I get down on a hit like I'm Sigel the cold
That nigga sniffed up yo coat I could bring you his nose
If he stole money from you P could bring you his hands
The nigga talk too much I bring the ears of his fans
Need weed to calm down, need money to leave light
Fuck a watch cause my time is tickin'
Fuck a chain I'm already hangin'
Fuck a gang I'm already bangin'

Play it sweet I might be in your house

Lick a shot for the predicate felons
And gangster niggas that know that 
Doing their time is better than tellin
Don't tell dog, lick a shot for the graveyard shift
And all the hustlers on ninety-five for the graveyard prick
Lick a shot for this weed I need
Just to see clear, to tell the truth I can't breathe a Ki
Lick a shot for the stick up kids that twist up wigs
that's the shit that happens when you pick up bids
Lick a shot for the foreign car, American trucks
Old timers that'll throw a stack of presidents up
Got dice shooter slang, need a pistol to hang
But the P understand cause the ghetto is fucked
Lick a shot for the fiends 
That got to go see the minors on the block to get medicined up
Lick a shot for the sake of licking a shot

Lick a shot for all my niggas on the run
And lick a shot for all my real niggas that got bodies on they gun
Lick a shot for my niggas cause I know they'll do the same
For my niggas that run through the flames and walk through the rain
Lick a shot for all the niggas growing up in the slums
Blowing they spliffs with they razor blades under they tongue
Lick a shot for all my niggas that be banging they hammers
Sticking up stores, taking the tape out the video cameras
Lick a shot at all y'all haters whether smaller or bigger
Lick a shot cause Hood ain't never been scared to pull a trigger
Lick a shot for all my niggas that be pumping they crills
When the beef start cooking they be bustin' they steel
Lick a shot cause I ain't scared to
And lick a shot cause I'm prepared to
Crack a buckle with the matching hair due

I lick shots for my niggas in jail
23 hours in the hole, on life parole

Closest food they ever gettin' to is city island
I lick shots for C-E-O's that hit niggas off for weed and don't care if you bleed
Just mind they business and go the other way
For the right price they could get you the yay
I lick shots for my thug ass niggas that'll put something in you
From they car and hit your face through the diner menu
Your body get numb, you swallow your tongue
Cough up blood, that's the work I do, what
I lick shots for my niggas that's not on tour
And gotta hustle to eat its the motherfuckin' way of the streets
Pay attention

Lick shots for the little babies in the projects
Running around unsupervised with sharp objects
Lick shots for papi that give you the yay half price
And niggas that ain't ever been heard but they mad nice
Nobody tell when I squeeze at your men
Lick shots when your diesels at ten, I'ma see you again
Lick shots cause my record is clean
Middle of the street, broad day lettin' it scream
If I'm lucky they'll squirt through your back
And after that I'll make sure I lick shots for the purple and yack
Lick shots just to guard your grill
To my nigga T and Green and my uncle and Arthur Kill
Lick shots for the S-L 6
Cherry red with them chrome things on it with the x-l lips
Lick shots for the niggas who got shot and ain't here

This is a true story ladies and gentlemen
You might not believe it though
But fuck it, that's why I'm the Ghost

I'm about to open up
Listen, one day I fell asleep and my knife woke me up
He said

Your gun is in the closet flippin'
Talkin' bout I get the most action he about to soak me up

So I went to the closet said ""Hammer what's wrong with you?""

You ain't busting me off, it's like I don't belong to you

I said I just beat a case daddy
And I'm trying to take it easy cause I gotta move this weight daddy
Then the hammer said

Man listen, used the knife twice in a row
Tell me if the plan switchin'
Cause we used to get around together
We used to put niggas down together, tell me if it's now or never

I said hammer take it easy baby
'Cause I got niggas to kill and I would never do you greasy baby
And all you gotta do is chill a while
And then the hammer said ""cool"" cause you know that I feel you Styles

I got a story to tell, my knife talk to me
But nobody believe that my knife talk to me
I got a story to tell, my hammer talk to me

I got a story to tell, my haze talk to me
But nobody believe that my haze talk to me
I got a story to tell, my money talk to me
But nobody believe that my money talk to me

My knife said to me

I hawk niggas down, bust arteries

And he get bright red for me
Knife you my nigga but leave me alone
I got to talk to my man Haze to get in the zone
I said ""Haze what the hell is up?""
He said

You know how we do, you know that we crew
So where's the vanilla dutch

Rolling something up, 
Thinking about killing every rapper in the game
And holding something up
My haze said to me

You need to calm down when the rage come to you
'Fore a grave or a cage or a gauge come to you
But you don't give a fuck 
So just open up your book and let your page come to you

Even though I'm humble and noble
I don't give a fuck
You ain't tryin' to hear me I'ma shoot through your mobile
It's funny, I'll stalk you
Hold up my niggas, it ain't a convo 'less your money start talking

[Chorus]

My money spoke to me
It said shit that if it wasn't for his ass there wouldn't be no hope for me
Money ain't everything, and then he laughed at me
And said the hammer oughta blast at me
He said I got you out of jail, paid for the lawyer and bail
Take a look at the cars and the crib
I keep the clothes on your back, food in your mouth
Even paid for the birds when you moved niggas south
Shit, I'm the reason why the block jumping
Let a nigga try to stop something, D-Block'll pop something
And I'm the reason why you ride or die
Keep a lot of me by your side, shoot niggas in the eye
I said money you the root of evil
How they print ""In God We Trust"" knowing what you do to people
But I'm a hard felon

If you want money or drugs
Talk with me
Know I got my niggas my guns
The hawk with me
Guess who? Jada, P, and The Sheek
Three bricks
Three whips
Three motherfucking ouies a week
Ten spots OT
Two blew off late
My niggas cop
Pop and talk, and we applying the pressure
So when you address us
It's Boss
Boss
And Boss

What up what up what up, yea!

[Styles] 
Eve let's do it again!

[Styles]
Yea it's the ghost Jada and Eve
I squeeze my shit, I don't wave it and leave
Y'all motherfuckin' extra lame
Here's the game, when I shoot seeds, your man can catch your brain
He looked a hero when he drove the taxi in the hallway
Shootin' niggas down if they clothes is tacky
Get an 18 or brick and my clothes is khaki
And the Porsche got a glass roof
The blunt got a live purple haze in it, little bit of hash too
See me when I pass through, fuck around and I'ma blast you
Do what I have to, tryin' to get my math too
I leave a message, ain't a phone I use
I call my niggas, bat 'em down, they bones I bruise
Leave 50 niggas dead, niggas know my groove
Another 20 more engine niggas know my tools
I got a gun, you need to stand fo'
Fuck you bring yo man fo? 

[Chorus: Styles, Jadakiss, Eve]
S be the ghost, Double R What
First come the hawk, then next come the toast
K to the R Double R what
Send mad cowards on they way to Allah
E-V-E, Double R What
First lady, I just point, they squeeze
Ryde or Die, Double R What
Better keep your hammer right by your side

[Jadakiss]
I gave you the best flows
On top of that, I even made niggas set goals
I wanna know how many bullets can your flesh hold
Thirty-two, or whatever the tech holes
My dirty crew rather hawk you to death rather than talk you to
death
'Cause listenin' is like livin' when yo' talkin' is death
So y'all better start readin' before you start bleedin'
And the odds was against us before we got EVE-n
Niggas in the hood don't give a fuck if you rich
Or drunk with the Prince CD own, bumpin' a kiss
Nigga frontin' I get my you in the pump kinda hot out
Hit the button put the roof in the trunk
Play the block with the Royal Blue 45 and make your mouth leak
Can't fuck with NY
Get my diesel from South Beach
you ain't got a ride, get yu a cab
ya' bitches is mad
Eve got the shit and smash

[Chorus]

[Eve]
I'm a savage bitch
Ain't nobody gettin' close to this
And ain't nobody flipped and wrote the shit
And can't nobody sit and coach this shit
You feelin' lucky? then approach me, shit
I'm like the glass, you just the coaster bitch, Under me!
You wanna make it ugly, can't do nothin' 'bout it
Angry at the public, buggin' me
Rat bitch, pot bitch, hungover hot bitch
Wantin' all that money, fuckin' gettin' all that rock, shit
Scared of who? huh, we goin' get rid of you
Climbin' the walls wit' gimmicks, that shit is pitiful
Dawgs close by me, so why try me
They wan' cop me but they too sloppy
Damn, I gotchu stuck in a box
You feelin' trapped, got your stomach in knots
'Cause I ain't lettin' go
I keepin' it locked
I know you gettin' mad 'cause your luck's up
Plus I'm a pure bread, baby, I don't fuck with mutts
Come on!

Everyday I need an ounce and a half
S.P.; the only flower that you know, with a bounce and a half
Listen kid, I need a mountain of cash
So I could roll up, hop in the whip and like, bounce to the ave
I get high cause I'm in the hood, the guns is around
It take a blunt, just to ease the pain that humbled me now (whew)
And I'd rather roll somethin' up; cause if I'm sober dog
I just might flip, grab my guns and hold somethin' up
I get high as a kite; I'm in the zone all alone
Motherfucker case I'm dyin' tonight (it happen tonight)
So I roll 'em up, back to back, fat as I could (uh-huh)
You got beef with Styles P, I come to splatter the hood

Aiyyo I smoke like a chim-in-ney 
Matter fact I, smoke like a gun, when a killer see his enemy
I smoke like Bob Marley did; add to that
That I smoke like the hippies did, back in the 70's
Spit with the finishin' touch - get this, that
I'ma finish you before I finish the dutch
I get high like the birds and the planes
I get high when, bullets hit faces after words exchanged
I get a rush, off the blood on the walls, you understand?
Like the, M-5 pedal, when it's touchin' the floor
I get high cause fuck it, what's better to do?
And I'mma never give a fuck (that's right) cause I'm better than you

""I get high, I get high, I get high, I get high
I get high, I get high, I get high, I get high

I'mma smoke 'til my lungs collapse; I'm from a era where
Niggas cause terror over guns and crack
Where a dollar bill is powerful; I smoke weed cause
Time seem precious, and I, know what a hour do (I know dat)
High for a livin', gots ta, ride for a livin'
With my, real gangsta niggas that'll die for a livin' (die my niggas)
Shit I get as high as I could; cause if you see things
Like I see things, that I'mma die in the hood (right here)
Motherfucker understand it's full service to you
I don't smoke the weed if it ain't purple or blue
And you could name any rapper, if you want he could die (anybody)
This is S.P., dump it in you bitch, I get high

[Chorus]
My life is all I have
My rhymes, my pen, my pad
And I done made it through the struggle, don't judge me
What you say now, won't budge me
'cause where I come from, so often
People you grew up with, layin' in a coffin
But I done made it through the pain in spite
It's my time now, my world, my life
My life

Is based on, lightin' blunts, loadin' guns
Tellin my lawyers to get the case gone (uh-huh)
I need the bills that the presidents got they face on
So I can switch my residence, get a truck and a Lex
Fuck a check, I no longer have to wait for 'em
I made a couple ends, lost a couple friends
I light a blunt 'cause never will the struggle end
So you can judge a nigga, but you ain't got it, you ain't in the role
So you really can't budge a nigga' you oughta love a nigga
For the fact that it's my world and my life but still I'm a rugged nigga
They say you buggin' nigga, fuck it, I'm a thuggin' nigga
You talkin bullshit then kick it with another nigga
I got a bigger bed and I need a cover nigga
And I ain't got friends - I got enemies
So if they with me, then that means they my brother nigga

[Chorus]

Is a blunt to the head, a prayer for the dead
Run around hustlin', scared of the feds
They said death is eternal sleep
But the only thing is you ain't really sure if you prepared for the bed
So often we get merked in the head, instead of big money
They got big momma hurtin' instead
My life is makin' the verse, but the handcuffs
The bullpens, the jail cells is makin' it worse
Tell mom I don't go to the church, tell Oc' I don't' go to mas
I blow blunts, hold guns, and I'ma be right there when the soldiers'll march
I play the part, and my heart seem colder than March
But on the flipside of things, it's still warmer than June
I have talks with the Lord and he'll be callin' me soon, what
And my life is all I have, my family, my niggas, my flow, my grabs what

We off the block this year
Went from a little to a lot this year
Everybody mad at the rocks that I wear
I know where I'm goin' and I know where I'm from
You hear LOX in your ear
Yea, we're at the airport out decline from the block
Where everybody air-forced-out
With a new white Tee, you fresh
Nothin' phony with us, make the money, get the mansion, bring the homies with us

Don't be fooled by the rocks that I got

To On the 6 to J. Lo to this headline clips
I stayed grounded as the amounts roll in
I'm real, I thought I told you
I really been on Oprah
That's just me
Nothin phony, don't hate on me

Rockin this business
I've grown up so much
I'm in control and loving it
Rumors got me laughing, kid
Love my life and my public
Put God first
Then can't forget to stay real
To me it's like breathing

It take hard work to cash checks
So don't be fooled by the rocks that I got, now assets
You get back what you put out
Even if you take the good route
Can't count the hood out
After a while, you know who to blink with
Just keep it real with the ones came in with
Best thing to do is stay low, LOX and J.Lo
Act like they don't, but they know
