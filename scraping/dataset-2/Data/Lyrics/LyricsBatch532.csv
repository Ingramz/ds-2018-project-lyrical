Katherine Jenkins,"I I who have nothing
I I who have no one
Adore you and want you so
I'm just a no one
With nothing to give you but oh
I Love You

You you buy her diamonds
Bright sparkling diamonds
But believe me dear when I say
That she can give you the world
But she'll never love you that way
I love you

She can take you any place she wants
To clubs and restaurants
But I can only watch you with
My nose pressed up against the window pane

I I who have nothing
I I who have no one
Must watch you go dancing by
Wrapped in the arms of somebody else
Darling t'is I
Who Loves you

I love you
I love you","I, Who Have Nothing",2008
Katherine Jenkins,"There used to be a graying tower, alone on the sea
You became the light on the dark side of me
Love remained a drug that's the high and not the pill

But did you know that when it snows my eyes become large and
The light that you shine can be seen?

Baby I compare you to a kiss from a rose on the gray
Oh, the more I get of you the stranger it feels, yeah
And now that your rose is in bloom a light hits the gloom on the gray

There is so much someone can tell you, so much she can say
You remain my power, my pleasure, my pain
Baby to me you're like a growing addiction that I can't deny
Won't you tell me is that healthy baby?

But did you know that when it snows my eyes become large and
The light that you shine can be seen?

Baby I compare you to a kiss from a rose on the gray
Oh, the more I get of you the stranger it feels, yeah
And now that your rose is in bloom a light hits the gloom on the gray

I've been kissed by a rose on the gray
I've been kissed by a rose
I've been kissed by a rose on the gray
I've been kissed by a rose on the gray

There is so much someone can tell you, so much she can say
You are my power, my pleasure, my pain
To me you're like a growing addiction that I can't deny
Won't you tell me is that healthy baby?

But did you know that when it snows my eyes become large and
The light that you shine can be seen?

Baby I compare you to a kiss from a rose on the gray
Oh, the more I get of you the stranger it feels, yeah
And now that your rose is in bloom a light hits the gloom on the gray

Yes, I compare you to a kiss from a rose on the gray
Oh, the more I get of you the stranger it feels, yeah
And now that your rose is in bloom a light hits the gloom on the gray
Now that your rose is in bloom a light hits the gloom on the gray

Katherine Jenkins,"Ancora non sai
Che mi incontrerai
In un tuo sogno distratto

Mi guarderai e comprenderai senza che debba parlarti
E non mi stupirò quando ti accorgerai
Di volermi lì
Sulle labbra

Mi respirerai e ti inebriero
Poi rincorrerrai
Il ricordo di me
Soffice mi sfiorerai
Prima di stringermi
Con l'aria fondermi
Mentre il tempo ci cullera

Spesso, vedrai mi perderai
Come non fossi reale

Ma tornerai
E mi coglierai
Come il più raro tra i fiori
E non ti stupirai
Quando mi accorgero
Che il tuo posto è tra le mie braccia

Mi respirerai e ti inebriero
Poi rincorrerrai
Il ricordo di me
Soffice mi sfiorerai
Prima di stringermi
Con l'aria fondermi
Mentre il rempo ci cullera",Ancora Non Sai,2009
Katherine Jenkins,"Spend all your time waiting for that second chance
For the break that will make it okay
There's always one reason to feel not good enough""
And it's hard at the end of the day
I need some distraction, oh beautiful release
Memories seeps from my veins
They may be empty and weightless, and maybe
I'll find some peace tonight

In the arms of an angel, fly away from here
From this dark, cold hotel room, and the endlessness that you fear
You are pulled from the wreckage of your silent reverie
You're in the arms of the angel, may you find some comfort there

So tired of the straight line, and everywhere you turn
There's vultures and thieves at your back
The storm keeps on twisting, you keep on building the lies
That you make up for all that you lack
It don't make no difference, escaping one last time
It's easier to believe
In this sweet madness, oh this glorious sadness
That brings me to my knees

In the arms of an angel, fly away from here
From this dark, cold hotel room, and the endlessness that you fear

Katherine Jenkins,"How can you see into my eyes like open doors
Leading you down into my core
Where I've become so numb
Without a soul
My spirit sleeping somewhere cold
Until you find it there and lead it back home

Wake me up inside
Wake me up inside
Call my name and save me from the dark
Bid my blood to run
Before I come undone
Save me from the nothing I've become

Now that I know what I'm without
You can´t just leave me
Breathe into me and make me real
Bring me to life

Wake me up inside
Wake me up inside
Call my name and save me from the dark
Bid my blood to run
Before I come undone
Save me from the nothing I've become

Bring me to life

Frozen inside without your touch
Without your love darling
Only you are the life among the dead

Bid my blood to run
Before I come undone
Save me from the nothing I've become",Bring Me to Life,2009

Katherine Jenkins,"Now I've heard there was a secret chord
That David played, and it pleased the Lord
But you don't really care for music, do you?
It goes like this
The fourth, the fifth
The minor fall, the major lift
The baffled king composing Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah

Your faith was strong but you needed proof
You saw her bathing on the roof
Her beauty and the moonlight overthrew you
She tied you
To a kitchen chair
She broke your throne, and she cut your hair
And from your lips she drew the Hallelujah

Baby I have been here before
I know this room, I've walked this floor
I used to live alone before I knew you.
I've seen your flag on the marble arch
Love is not a victory march
It's a cold and it's a broken Hallelujah

Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah

There was a time you let me know
What's really going on below
But now you never show it to me, do you?
And remember when I moved in you
The holy dove was moving too
And every breath we drew was Hallelujah

Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah

You say I took the name in vain
I don't even know the name
But if I did, well really, what's it to you?
There's a blaze of light
In every word
It doesn't matter which you heard
The holy or the broken Hallelujah

Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah

I did my best, it wasn't much
I couldn't feel, so I tried to touch
I've told the truth, I didn't come to fool you
And even though
It all went wrong
I'll stand before the Lord of Song
With nothing on my tongue but Hallelujah

Katherine Jenkins,"Something in the way you held me
Heaven in the words you said
Tonight I'm looking at the open window
Liyng in our empty bed

I try in vain to remember
So afraid to forget
How light the snow was falling last December
On your silhouette

Clinging to a memory of you
Lying by a winter's flame
The night I told you a was born to love you
And how I'd never be the same

For as long as I'm living
I'll will always regret
How all the tme I never took a picture
Of your silhouette

I used to close my eyes
And only see your face
But time was made to fly
And carry you away

How light the snow was falling last December
On your silhouette

Oh, and maybe if I try to listen
I can hear you call my name
From out across the great and mighty distance
Something like an open sea

Helping me to remember
So afraid to forget
How light the snow was falling last December
On your silhouette",Your Silhouette,2011
Katherine Jenkins,"Where did I misplace my faith
Where did I set it down
Which one the day that I forgot
What this was all about
And I came so close
To throwing it all away
But I'm taking it back again

So come and rejoice
Come and rejoice
What was lost is found

When did I get so sensible
Make me a fool again
My life was a half empty glass
Now it is full again
And this road we take
Is never an easy place
But somehow we've found our way

So come and rejoice
Come and rejoice
And you don't even have to make a sound
I feel it in your touch
You sing it with you eyes
What was lost is found

So come and rejoice
Come and rejoice
What was lost is what was lost is
What was lost is found
What was lost is found",Rejoice,2011
Katherine Jenkins,"Nighttime sharpens, heightens each sensation
Darkness stirs and wakes imagination
Silently the senses abandon their defenses
Helpless to resist the notes I write
For I composed the music of the night

Slowly, gently, night unfurls its splendor
Grasp it, sense it, tremulous and tender
Hearing is believing, music is deceiving
Hard as lightning, soft as candle light
Dare you trust the music of the night

Close your eyes for your eyes will only tell the truth
And the truth isn't what you want to see
In the dark it is easy to pretend
That the truth is what it ought to be

Softly
Deafening
Music shall caress you
Hear it
Feel it
Secretly posses you
Open up your mind, let your fantasies unwind
In this darkness which you know you cannot fight
The darkness of the music of the night

Close your eyes, start a journey through a strange new world
Leave all thoughts of the world you knew before
Close your eyes and let music set you free
Only then can you belong to me

Floating, falling
Sweet intoxication
Touch me
Touch me
Trust me
Trust me
Savor each sensation

Let the dream begin
Let your darker side give in
To the power of the music that I write
The power of the music of the night

You alone can make my song take flight
Help me make the music of the
Help me make the music of the night

No crib for His bed,

No crying He makes.

Look down from the sky
And stay by my cradle

On a one-horse open sleigh,

Laughing all the way;
Bells on bob-tail ring,
making spirits bright,

A sleighing song tonight

Jingle bells, jingle bells,
jingle all the way!
O what fun it is to ride
In a one-horse open sleigh

A day or two ago,
I thought I'd take a ride,
And soon Miss Fanny Bright
Was seated by my side;
The horse was lean and lank;
Misfortune seemed his lot;
He got into a drifted bank,
And we, we got upsot.

Jingle Bells, Jingle Bells,
Jingle all the way!
What fun it is to ride
In a one-horse open sleigh.

A day or two ago,
the story I must tell
I went out on the snow
And on my back I fell;
A gent was riding by
In a one-horse open sleigh,
He laughed as there
I sprawling lie,
But quickly drove away.

Jingle Bells, Jingle Bells,
Jingle all the way!
What fun it is to ride
In a one-horse open sleigh.

Now the ground is white
Go it while you're young,
Take the girls tonight
And sing this sleighing song;
Just get a bob-tailed bay
two-forty as his speed
Hitch him to an open sleigh
And crack! you'll take the lead.

Right from the start
Always been you I hid
Inside my heart
Did my best 
Not to confess
Cause we both belong to someone else
Now nothing's left
In our way
No one to hurt
No hearts to break
It's time you knew
It's always been you

You were who I'd turn to
On dark and lonely nights
I wouldn't have made through it
Without you in my life
You talked me through the hard times
And held me through goodbyes
You knew me like nobody could
But never realized

So many nights I dreamed
Of how it would be
Say that you feel it too
Tell me now
What are we gonna do?

Round yon Virgin Mother and Child
Holy Infant so tender and mild
Sleep in heavenly peace

Silent night, holy night!
Shepherds quake at the sight
Glories stream from heaven afar
Heavenly hosts sing Alleluia!

Radiant beams from Thy holy face
With the dawn of redeeming grace

Kathleen Battle,"If you hear
A song in blue
Like a flower crying
For the dew
That was my heart serenading you
My prelude to a kiss

If you hear a song that grows
From my tender sentimental woes
That was my heart trying to compose
A prelude to a kiss

Though it's just a simple melody
With nothing fancy
Nothing much
You could turn it to a symphony
A Shubert tune with a Gershwin touch

Oh how my love song gently cries
For the tenderness within your eyes
My love is a prelude that never dies
A prelude to a kiss

Though it's just a simple melody
With nothing fancy
Nothing much

I've waited so long to be with you this special way
Don't be afraid, afraid to stay
And share your love with me this way

I understand baby it's your very first time
I'll be gentle with you baby, it's gonna be alright

I'll be good to you baby, sweet to you lady

Get together party people
We're gonna change today
Grooving like there's no tomorrow
Rock the night away
Love the jams coming out my speakers
DJ daddy play
All my people hangin' out and we're all gonna stay

I like how you turn me on (4x)

Make the most of this funky feeling
Dance the night away
Left my car keys in the restroom
I guess I'll have to stay
Music's hot here at this night spot
Another drink OK
Sippin' on my dry martini
I look at you and say

I like how you turn me on (4x)

Funky how love can deceive
Tell me all the wonderful things I should believe
When it tells her the same then love becomes a game
I land softly on my feet so naive

Turn me on I've got the fever
Switch me off now I can't believe ya, baby

And the rain fell down hard that day onto the tin roof

Better keep your heart close hunters are coming for you""

Every meal for you I made

I was scared but I kept real quiet
Shadows on the walls moving in on me...

But maybe sometimes we've got to trust ourselves not to scream out loud, and run like hell...

Believe in me, I don't want to anymore
And in the dark, picture me in your mind

By accident you hit the farmyard cat
He ran for the fields and came back the next day
You'd blown out his eye and you could see his brain
That's it boy, there is some things in life, you don't want to do, but you know is right
So take him out back and finish him off
Got your gun off the shelf, it only took one shot

And I flew away and I paid on your final day
They said that you waited 'til I came
We sang your favorite hymns and we held your hand

I tried so hard not to cry and all...

In your ear while you were sleeping

Out in the world without me

Somewhere to build me a faith, a farm and a family.
Somewhere to grow older, and somewhere a reason to try.

Kathleen Haskard,"I'm going back where I come from
I'm going lookin' for someone
Someone I left behind
We were both such babies at the time

When my family moved away
Wanted you to go , but you had to stay
And out the back window, as I waved good-bye
Your mother held you as you cried

We play hide and seek, finders keep
Only the loser is left to weep
Gotta secret can I keep it
Better cross my heart and hope to die

Gonna go be a big girl now
I'm gonna go show them just how
I can make it all on my own
They'll say my girl how you've grown

And I'll be married in the spring
No white dress, no diamond ring
With a baby on the way 
I know I heard one say, guess she never learned a thing

Some say leave well enough alone
Some thing's better if never known
But I still remember the place
Just have no name for an empty space

I am the voice

Midnight shimmering
Why can't you just open your mind
I'm tired of listening to the screams
Which comes from inside
Try to sleep now in solitude you shall awake
Sleep as a child all I feel is he's shattering gaze
Come with me I'll protect you from the voices within
I can't I wish I was close to you I can't bear this pain

Adrian please wake me...

Screams are shattering your vains
Promises only pain shall remain
Why do you struggle your fear
My gaze shall shatter your stear
Why do you petty yourself
Why can't you reach out instead
Why won't you trust me I am your voice you shall see...

There's no sleep tonight
Flashing memories fills my mind
I fell so close to you
Can't you stay with me until eternity

Screams shall forever reach your mind
Why, cause only one day you shall be mine
Creation of souls I make them blind
Eternal, soon they shall all be mine...

But it wouldn't be nothing, nothing without a woman or a girl

Man made the trains to carry heavy loads
Man made electric light to take us out of the dark
Man made the boat for the water, like Noah made the ark

This is a man's, a man's, a man's world
But it wouldn't be nothing, nothing without a woman or a girl

Man thinks about a little baby girls and a baby boys
Man makes then happy 'cause man makes them toys
And after man has made everything, everything he can
You know that man makes money to buy from other man

For being such a stubborn woman in such stubborn times

And an open door is to me now like the saddest of goodbyes

Made the air feel like it was dancing
Your eyes like an old coloured vinyl
Were hiding in grooves a smile
Like a sweet aria

I was searching for something divine
And ended up making the mundane into my shrine

A little but we're tricked by the same sense of wanting
Like silence mistaken for knowing
Like a desert's mistaken for sea
Like a tongue has a mother
We belong to each other
We belong to each other

Is so overrated
Complete darkness
Is so embracive

There were crows and seagulls
Stood on either side
Like angels and demons

Lover,
There will be another one
Who'll hover
Over you beneath the sun
Tomorrow
See the things that never come
Today

When you see me
Fly away without you
Shadow on the things you know
Feathers fall around you
And show you the way to go
It's over, it's over.

Nestled
In your wings my little one
This special
Morning brings another sun
Tomorrow
See the things
That never come

When you see me
Fly away without you
Shadow on the things you know
Feathers fall around you
And show you the way to go
It's over, it's over.

Every day I spend my time drinking wine, feeling fineâ?¦
Waiting here to find the sign that I can understand, yes, I am.

Bloody flowers push their hands into the airâ?¦
I don't care if I ever know, there I go.

Don't push your love too far.
Your wounds won't leave a scar.
Right now is where you areâ?¦
In a broken dream!

Did someone bow their head?
Did someone break the bread?
Good people are in bed before nine o'clock.

On the pad before my eyes, paper cries, telling lies,
The promises you gave from the grave of a broken heartâ?¦

Because of him
Claustrophobic, sleeping hot
Law can't keep the power
That you want within

But who is your future resting its head upon?
Will you love in the same way?
Or will it come back unopened?

Change came unexpected
Like it always does
You either move with it
Or run away from it's clutches
But it will come back

Where is you future going to settle down?
Will you move pushing boundaries?
Or leave them unopened?

Is this your future holding back your heart?

So early on that morning, the moon still way up high
The moon still way up high
Though soon enough the sun would warm the colors of the sky
I lay awake I could not sleep or even close my eyes
And dear you seemed so restless too I should have realized

The house was dark the moonlight was inviting and so strange
I went out by the window to watch the morning change
And just before the break of dawn and bird began to sing
And somehow then it came to me just what the day would bring

   That dawn the day you left me was so beautiful and sad
   How could I have turned away from the troubles that we had
   I know you tried to make me see and no I never would
   Too late that dawn the day you left I finally understood

A stray old cat did walk the fence outside my window bed
He stopped and looked my way and then he went without a care
And I wondered when heÂ'd ramble back or why he ever should 
But I knew that he was just like you and that he never would

   That dawn the day you left me was so beautiful and sad
   How could I have turned away from the troubles that we had

Kathy Kallick,"'Twas battered and scarred and the auctioneer
Thought it scarcely worth his while
To waste much time on the old violin
But he held it up with a smile.

What am I bidden, good folks, he cried
Who will start bidding for me?
A dollar, a dollar - then Two! Only two?
Two dollars, and who'll make it three?
Three dollars, once; three dollars, twice;
Going for three - But no

From the room far back a gray haired man
Came forward and picked up the bow;
Then wiping the dust from the old violin
And tightening the loose strings
He played a melody pure and sweet
As sweet as a caroling angel sings.

The music ceased and the auctioneer
With a voice that was quiet and low
Said What am I bidden for the old violin?
And he held it up with the bow.
A thousand dollars, and who'll make it two?
Two thousand! And who'll make it three?
Three thousand once; three thousand, twice;
And going, and gone! said he.

The people cheered and some of them cried
We do not understand What changed its worth?
Swift came the reply: 
The touch of the master's hand.

And many a man with life out of tune
And battered and scattered with sin
Is auctioned cheap to the thoughtless crowd
Much like the old violin. 

A ""mess of pottage a glass of wine;
A game - and he travels on.
He's ""going"" once and "" going"" twice
He's ""going"" and ""almost gone."" 

But the Master comes and the foolish crowd
Never can quite understand 
The worth of a soul and the change that's wrought 
By the touch of the Master's hand.

Like walking and talking in the late afternoon

I see you hitch-hiking in the rain
Sleeping on the sand off the coast of Spain
Laughing up your sleeve in some cafe in Vienna
Me a painter, you a poet
Through the years though we don't show it
We're both afraid we've lost track of these talents
Yet in each other we find a sense of balance

",See You in Seattle,1993
Kathy Kallick,"I took a minute to think of you before I sailed upon a silent sea
I took the time to review the careful kinds of things you always said to me
You never said you were in love
You only told me just enough
You never said you were in love
You only said that it was circumstance
You didn't think it wise to take that kind of chance
We didn't have to fly, we only wanted one slow dance
Let's dance

It doesn't always take a fool to ask a simple question give an answer yes or no
A fool ain't gonna see the writing on the wall, hit you on the head, you know-it-all
You never said you were in love
You talked about a lot of stuff
You never said you were in love
Did you think you were the only one to ever think of that
The man with all the facts
Was it a cautious act or was it ceremonial chat
Chit-chat

If we had never had a single kiss, we wouldn't find ourselves in a fix like this
But when you think of all the empty faces in a single day, too bad you didn't say
You were in love, you never said
You only acted so stuck up
I should have known
You were in love
It took the distance of a thousand nights
And all the time of space
To finally see the brightest light

Heart on my sleeve, out on a limb
I'm lost at sea, no help in sight
I should have known
You were in love

I love my mister man,
And I can't tell yo' why,
There ain't no reason
Why I should love that man.
It must be something that the angels done plan.

I got to love one man till I die.

Tell me I'm crazy (maybe I know).

I don't know what I'll find but baby it's my time
And I'll surely leave my heart below the Mason-Dixon line
I've seen a lot of folks 'round the street tonight
Can't seem to find the words to say goodbye
We're close enough to touch but speaking is too much
And goodbyes are heard without a word
And they're much more than enough

They just can't bring themselves to understand
They think I run away, but to run would be to stay
Cause the things you want are only worth the price you have to pay
What is home but a place you keep within your heart
And call on when you need to feel assured
A place where all you need to be is what you are-
A past that in the present somehow makes you feel secure

Only by doing, when it comes your turn
Everything comes around, so be ready if you can
Prepare your heart like the farmer turns the land
You plant your fields
When the spring is tender
When the summer beats down
You pray for rain
You hope for the harvest
And the long cold winter
And then you plant your fields again
He spoke right to my restless soul
Still wild, and hungry, and beyond control
For all that you dream, there's a time and a place
But you won't know it till it comes your turn
You plant your fields
When the spring is tender
When the summer beats down
You pray for rain
You hope for the harvest
And the long cold winter
And then you plant your fields again",You Plant Your Fields,1986
Kathy Mattea,"Shining like a beacon through the darkest night
You're the only light that leads me home
Home is where the fire burns so warm and bright
'Long as I have you, I'll never roam
Our paths may wander on this walk of life
But I won't walk alone
Like a blaze of gold
At the break of dawn
You're the power that heals my soul
When the wind grows cold
And I'm halfway gone
You're the power that keeps me whole
Running like a river to the rolling sea
The waters of your love are deep and strong
My harbor and my shelter, you will always be
Even when the storm blows hard and long
While your spirit is a part of me
It gives life to this song",You're the Power,1986

Promises that fall
Can leave your precious dreams defenseless
Back against the wall

A tree to carve your name in as long as I have a heart
As long as you need a love that time won't take away
Baby, you have it made as long as I have a heart

A hail of dew, can you think your thoughts in?
A garden where they grow
A peaceful place to settle down in
Away from winds that blow

To the love we share
Through the good and the bad times too
I'll forsake my rest
For your happiness

With God as my witness
This vow I will make
To have and to hold you
No other to take
For rich or for poor
Under skies grey or blue

There are wars and there are rumors
Of wars yet to come
Temptations we'll have to walk through
Though others may tremble
I will not run
'Til my death I will stand by you

I will put on the armor of faithfulness
To fight for a heart that is true
'Til the battle is won, I will not rest

Every love's the same
Every love has memories
Every love has pain
I knew love at twenty
I knew love at nine
But the love I know right now
Is the sweetest love I'll ever find
Every town's familar
Every town is strange
When you're feeling lonely
Every town's the same
I have dreamed of Paris
And I have dreamed of Rome
But the dream we're in right now
Is the sweetest dream I've ever known

In the silent
Shelter of the night
Hide me
Safely wrapped in your arms
Till morning light
Every love remembers
Every love forgets

But I have no regrets

Love is made of gold
But the love that we have made
Is the sweetest love I'll ever know",Every Love,1987

Kathy Mattea,"Late in the day when shadows start to play
On my backdoor and up and down this alleyway
I think back on the times with your hand in mine
We sat talking low...late in the day
It seems you never know a good thing till it goes
Slippin' through your fingers...that's just the price I pay
For being on my own and doin' the best I can
Now I'm alone without a plan...late in the day
Now I pour whiskey, break the ice
Put my feet up and close my eyes
I try hard to listen to what my heart might say
Try to find the rhyme to take me back in time
And be with you here...late in the day
Now, I look out over tops of houses and the shops
As the sun sets, another day does wind down
And my life is still the same, my lips still call your name
And my heart can't hide the pain...late in the day

Do you lie awake nights

And though you may hide it, love knows how you feel 
And though you may trespass on the laws of the land 
Your heart has to follow when love takes your hand 

And it seems we're two people within the same circle 
It's drawn tighter and tighter till you're all that I see 
I'm full and I'm empty and you're pouring through me

He was home each night by eight,
But one stormy evening, he was late.
Her frightened tears fell to the floor,
Until his key turned in the door.

For sixty years, she heard him snore.

In separate beds on different floors.

Forgot the names of family. 
She never spoke a word again,
Then one day, they wheeled him in. 
He held her hand and stroked her hair,
In a fragile voice she said:

And there's a whisper of a breeze.
Blowing through the tangled silver,
Hanging from the cypress trees.
There's a river made of moonlight,
Flowing clear across the lake.
And there's a million stars just waitin',
To fall for any wish we make. 

Darlin' tonight I am reminded,
How much these two hearts need romance.
You know it isn't all that often,
We get this kind of chance.
Why don't we get caught in this moment?
Be victims of sweet circumstance?
Tonight I feel like all creation,
Is asking us to dance. 

There'll be time enough tomorrow,
To get back to our daily bread.
But there's something 'bout this evening,
That's put this notion in my head.
That heaven and the earth are meeting,
Tonight upon this very spot.
And all the things on earth worth havin',
Are things that we've already got. 

Darlin' tonight I am reminded,
How much these two hearts need romance.

And the snow-capped mountains white. 
From a distance the ocean meets the stream, 
And the eagle takes to flight. 
From a distance, there is harmony, 
And it echoes through the land. 

It's the voice of hope, it's the voice of peace, 
It's the voice of every man. 
From a distance we all have enough, 
And no one is in need. 

And there are no guns, no bombs, and no disease, 
No hungry mouths to feed. 
From a distance we are instruments 
Marching in a common band. 

Playing songs of hope, playing songs of peace. 
They're the songs of every man. 
God is watching us. God is watching us. 
God is watching us from a distance. 

From a distance you look like my friend, 
Even though we are at war. 
From a distance I just cannot comprehend 
What all this fighting is for. 
From a distance there is harmony, 
And it echoes through the land. 

And it's the hope of hopes, it's the love of loves, 
It's the heart of every man. 
It's the hope of hopes, it's the love of loves.

Kathy Mattea,"There was a motorcycle mama and her man
With a wind-burnt tan and a Harley
Roarin' through Bakersfield when her water broke
They pulled into a hospital and for a little joke

They named him Harley
They bought a sidecar
And a small bandanna band
And they loved their Harley

Slidin' sideways, up the coast
Cruisin' highway one
The sidecar came undone
No one noticed

Thrashing through a golden meadow
It came to rest right where
A farmer's wife cried
""Jesus Christ has answered all our prayers""

And they named him Harley
Because of a tattoo
That claimed his name was true
And they loved their Harley

He was raised upon a farm, cradled in the arms
Of Beulah and Barney
But then at a restless age they unlocked his cage
And he became a carny

There was a motorcycle daredevil deluxe
Jumping fifty trucks at the fairgrounds
A middle aged hippie couple way up in the stands
Heard the crowd chanting 'loud, the name of this young man

And they called him Harley
And that hippie couple smiled
Could this be their long lost child?
So they met Harley

Convinced him of the news
When they compared tattoos
And they loved their Harley",Harley,1991

For if dreams were a fire, I had desire,
That could burn this old house to the ground.

And the rain comes washing clean,
On the summer of my dreams. 

See the raindrops on the grass now,
Just like diamonds lying there.
By the old road where I pass now,
There's a twilight in the air. 

And as the sun sets down before me,
I see my true love waiting for me,
Standing by the back porch screen,
In the summer of my dreams.

Kathy Mattea,"She gets up an hour before she really wants to
Gets a half day's work done before the day begins
She makes a list of everything that everybody needs from her
And all that she did yesterday today she'll do again
She goes off to her job, the school, the bank and then the store
Then you're surprised 'cause she broke down as you walked in the door
Maybe she's human
Maybe she's got troubles to
Maybe she could stand to get away
Maybe she needs something new
Or maybe all she needs to someone
Just to see her point of view...
Maybe that's you
After working late today, she brings in bags of groceries
Bandages a skinned-up knee as the chicken starts to fry
She drops a glass, the baby cries, the phone rings,
That's when you walk in unloading all your problems
And the worries on your mind
When you mention it's your boys' night out, she tears you into shreds
And you just can't quite figure out why she gets all upset
Maybe she's human
Maybe she's got troubles to
Maybe she could stand to get away
Maybe she needs something new
Or maybe all she needs to someone
Just to see her point of view...

Nobody's listenin' to the band tonight
Nobody feels like dancin' in this sad cafe
Oh, but you and me, baby, we got somethin' to live for
One more step and we'll be out that door
I don't know where we're goin', but we're already on our way

The train is leavin' and it won't come back
We got one-way tickets on a one-way track
Nobody's gonna get their hands on the plans we made
And nobody's gonna rain on our parade

Well there's a red light blinking on an empty street
Church bells ringing in the dog-day heat
The more we try to change things, the more they stay the same
But there ain't no tellin' just what we'll find
Out past the city limit sign
There's a voice out there, and I heard it callin' our name

Jack Frost nipping at your nose
Yule-tide carols being sung by a choir
And folks dressed up like Eskimos.

Everybody knows a turkey and some mistletoe
Help to make the season bright
Tiny tots with their eyes all aglow
Will find it hard to sleep tonight.

They know that Santa's on his way
He's loaded lots of toys and goodies on his sleigh
And every mother's child is gonna spy
To see if reindeer really know how to fly.

To kids from one to ninety-two
Although it's been said many times, many ways

Would someday walk on water?

Will soon deliver you

Mary, did you know your Baby Boy
Will give sight to a blind man?
Mary, did you know that your Baby Boy
Will calm a storm with His hand?

Did you know that your Baby Boy
Has walked where angels trod?
When you've kissed your little Baby
Then you've kissed the face of God

Mary did you know?
Mary, did you know?

The blind will see, the deaf will hear
The dead will live again
The lame will leap, the dumb will speak
The praises of the Lamb

Mary, did you know that your Baby Boy
Is Lord of all creation?
Mary, did you know that your Baby Boy
Will one day rule the nations?

With a leftover finger or two
I took 'em for granted, let 'em all slip away
Now where they are I wish I knew

They roll by just like water
And I guess we never learn
Go through life parched and empty
Standing knee deep in a river and dying of thirst

Sometimes I remember sweethearts I've known
Some I've forgotten I suppose
One or two still linger, oh, and I wonder now
Why I ever let them go?

They roll by just like water
And I guess we never learn
Go through life parched and empty
Standing knee deep in a river and dying of thirst

So the sidewalk is crowded, the city goes by
And I rush through another day
And a world full of strangers turn their eyes to me
But I just look the other way

In a far off land
Wise men saw a sign
And set out 'cross the sand
Songs of praise to sing
They travelled day and night
Precious gifts to bring
They were guided by the light

They chased a brand new star
Ever towards the west
Across the mountains far
But when it came to rest
They scarce believed their eyes
They'd come so many miles
The miracle they prized
Was nothing but a child

Nothing but a child
Could wash those tears away
Or guide a weary world
Into the light of day
Nothing but a child
Could help erase those miles
So once again we all
Can be children for a while

Now all around the world
In every little town
Every day is heard
A precious little sound
And every mother kind
And every father, proud
Looks down in awe to fiund
Another chance allowed

Nothing but a child
Could wash those tears away
Or guide a weary world
Into the light of day
Nothing but a child
Could help erase those miles
So once again we all
Can be children for a while

Moves me like thunder, soothes me like rain

Softly your voice calls me out loud

Callin' me home like a whisper on the wind

Kathy Mattea,"I have always been on the outside
Looking inside 'till I found you
Never knowin' where my life would lead
What I could believe 'till you broke through
Where on Earth did you come from?

It's like I've known you all my life because
I have laughed and cried 'till my tears ran dry
I have lived and died a thousand times
I have won and lost at whatever cost
But through it all it's true
I have always loved you

Just the way you smile lights up the day
And I'm blown away just to be with you
The way you touched my life with such tenderness
Words cannot express how you pull me through
And if I could do it all again

I'd still reach for you, my love, my friend
I have laughed and cried 'till my tears ran dry
I have lived and died a thousand times
I have won and lost at whatever cost
But through it all it's true
I have always loved you

Kathy Mattea,"I need to go down and wash my face
Deep in the river of my old home place
I need to walk in the waters, that once gave me life
Go over and walk the old railroad tracks
See if I can follow it all the way back
Back to where my vision is clear
Back to the days of the innocent years

Though I'd trade it all back in
For just one day like it was back then
Back before just living my life got in the way
To see my face at sixteen again
When the boy down the street was my best friend
When his smile took away my tears
Back in the days of the innocent years

You might grow wiser every day
But there's a price you have to pay
The girl I was just disappeared
I left her behind in the innocent years

Now and then when the sun goes down
I can see the moon over my hometown
I can almost hear the train rushing by
I close my eyes and say a prayer
To the wide eyed girl that I lost somewhere
Maybe someday she'll find me here
And lead me back to the innocent years

You might grow wiser every day
But there's a price you have to pay
Girl I was just disappeared
Left her behind in the innocent years

When I get lost along the way
And I can't see the light of day
I can almost feel her near
Calling me back to the innocent years, yeah, yeah
The innocent years, woah, oh

Kathy Mattea,"There was a gentleman I knew
A stroke held his wife fast asleep
And his whole life had come down to
The vigil he would daily keep
I asked would he rather be free ?
And this is how he answered me
That's the deal, that's the bargain that you make
That's the vow that two hearts take
That if better turns to worse you will abide
That's the deal, if it were not for God's grace
I might be there in her place and she'd be right by my side
That's the deal

I keep those words like souvenirs
Brought from a place where couples walk
Arm in arm through this veil of tears

'Cause there's one man dead
On that Harlan County line

Oh anger, like poison
Is eating at your soul
Your thoughts are as loud as gunfire
Your face as hard as coal
Bitterness, like buckshot explodes inside your mind
And there's one man dead
On that Harlan County line

Oh a miner's life is fragile
It could shatter just like ice
But those who bear the struggle
Have always pay the price
There's blood upon the contact
Like vinegar in wine
And there's one man dead
On that Harlan County line

From the river bridge at Highsplint
To the Brookside railroad track
You can feel the long streak building 
That can never be turned back
The dead go forward with us
Not one is left behind
'Cause there's one man dead
On that Harlan County line

Where the night is as cold as iron
You can feel it in your bones
It settles like a shroud on the grave of Lawrence Jones
The graveyard shift is walking from the bathhouse into the mine
And there's one man dead
On that Harlan County line
One man dead 
On that Harlan County line
One miner dead 
On that Harlan County line",Lawrence Jones,2008
Kathy Mattea,"[Chorus: ]
Oh can't you see that pretty little bird
Sing with all his heart and soul
He's got a blood red spot on his wing
And all the rest of him is black, as coal

Of all the colors I ever did see
Red and black are the ones I dread
For when a man spills blood on the coal
They carry him down form the coal mine, dead

Oh fly away you red winged bird
Leave behind the miner's wife
She'll dream about you when you're gone
She'll dream about you all her life

[Chorus: ]",Red-Winged Blackbird,2008
Kathy Mattea,"In the deep dark hills of Eastern Kentucky
That's the place where I trace my bloodline
And it's there I read on a hillside gravestone
""You'll never leave Harlan alive""

Oh, my granddad's dad crossed the Cumberland Mountains
Where he took a pretty girl to be his bride
Said, ""Won't you walk with me out of the mouth of this holler
Or we'll never leave Harlan alive?""

[Chorus]
Where the sun comes up about ten in the mornin'
The sun goes down about three in the day
And you'll fill your cup with whatever bitter brew you're drinkin'
And you spend your life just thinkin' of how to get away

No one ever knew there was coal in them mountains
Till a man from the northeast arrived
He was waving hundred dollar bills said, ""I'll pay you for your minerals""
But he never left Harlan alive

Grandma sold out cheap and they moved out west of Pikeville
To a farm where big Richland river winds
Oh, I bet they danced them a jig and they laughed and sang a new song
""Who said we'd never leave Harlan alive""

But the times got hard and tobacco wasn't selling
And old granddad knew what he'd do to survive
So he went and dug Harlan coal, sent the money back to granny
But he never left Harlan alive

[Chorus]

Where the sun comes up aboud ten in the mornin'
The sun goes down about three in the day
And you'll fill your cup with whatever bitter brew you're drinkin'
And you spend your life diggin' coal from the bottom of your grave",You'll Never Leave Harlan Alive,2008

And maybe I've learned this time
I hope that I find what I'm reaching for
The way that it is in my mind

Someday I'll get over you
I'll live to see it all through
But I'll always miss
Dreaming my dreams with you

But I won't let it change me
Not if I can
I'd rather believe in love
And give it away as much as I can

The sweetest days are the days that used to be
The saddest words I ever heard were words of parting
When you said ""Sweetheart, remember me""

Remember me when the candle lights are gleaming
Remember me at the close of a long, long day
It would be so sweet when all alone I'm dreaming
Just to know you still remember me

You told me once that you were mine alone forever
And I was yours 'till the end of eternity
But all our vows are broken now and you will never
Be the same except in memory

Remember me when the candle lights are gleaming
Remember me at the close of a long, long day
It would be so sweet when all alone I'm dreaming
Just to know you still remember me

A sweeter smile, a love more bold and free
But in the end, fair weather friends may break your heart, dear

There might be another star
But through my eyes the light of you it's all I see 
For you
There might be another song
But all my heart can hear is your melody 
So long ago my heart without demanding
Informed me that no other love could do
But listen did I not though understanding
Fell in love with one
Who would break my heart in two 
For you
Love might bring a toast of wine
But which each sparkle know the best for you I pray 
For you
Love might be for you to find
But I will celebrate our love of yesterday

This is what they taught me
Every mystery I pursued
Was a secret I already knew

Love is in control
Oh, if you could find the angel within
Time, time to have faith in your wings

Free, everybody's free
In the new day that's coming
Freedom for all is our destiny

Every stone that I left unturned
Soon came back to haunt me
Every fall, every finger burned
Was a step on the road to truth
That I am you, my soul
You are not alone
Oh, when your heart is turned to stone
Love, love is the only way home

Free, everyone's free

How I long for your stubborn love

Funny me, just couldn't see
Even long before I knew you, you were loving me
Sometimes I cry, you must cry too
When you see the broken promises I've made to you

I keep saying that I'll trust you though I seldom do
Yet you stay and say, you love me still
Knowing someday I'll be like you

And your stubborn love, it never lets go of me
I don't understand how you can stay
Perfect love embracing the worst in me
How I long for your stubborn love

Kathy Troccoli,"Here I am again, I’ve failed You, Father, I have sinned
I’m sad to see how very weak that I can be
Being made of flesh and blood, I know I grieve Your heart
So much, I’m overwhelmed that You still care for me

And I don’t want to wander from the truth
Oh God, why do I do the things I do?

Grace rain on me
Love surround me
Life restore me
Lord, forgive me

Peace flow through me
Hope come to me
Faith embrace me
Lord, I’m at Your mercy
(Mercy)

It only takes a moment’s time
For me to somehow cross a line
Where I can wind up roaming in the dark
Satan is a liar, I know he can start a fire
Then go tearing everything I have apart

And there’s nothing that can take your love away
Oh dear Lord, all that I know to do is pray

Grace rain on me
Love surround me
Life restore me
Lord, forgive me

Peace flow through me
Hope come to me
Faith embrace me
Lord, I’m at Your mercy
(Mercy)

Morning by morning
New mercies I see
Great is Your faithfulness
Lord, unto me

Grace rain on me
Love surround me
Life restore me

Kathy Troccoli,"I've traveled long
I've traveled hard
And stumbled many times along the way
I've bruised my knees a lot
And turned my back on God
And seen His mercy
I've been quick to judge
And slow to learn
So many times I've gotten in the way
I think I know so much
I've questioned God enough
But still He loves me
So now I'll walk a different road
I want to see Him there before I even go
I've run ahead and gone too slow
I've got to be still now
Wait upon His will now
This time,
It's gonna be His time
don't want to live without
The peace that comes to me
When I am by His side
I've known the freedom there
can't find it anywhere
But in Christ Jesus
I believe he's got a plan

I may not always understand

Snow will fall but I'll recall your warmth
Summer wind breathing in your memory
I'll miss you

And I'll hear your voice and there we will laugh again
And there will come a day when I'll hold you close

But I'll say goodbye for now

I can't imagine my life without you
You've held a place all your own
Just knowing you were beneath the same sky
Oh, what a joy I have known

On starry nights I'll glimpse the light of your smile

That I have grown
Through all the sorrow
I have known
But, if that's what it takes
For You to lead me this far

Seen the beauty of a rose
Sat by many fires
And enjoyed the warmth of friends

We'd take our time and live our lives
Together day by day
We'll make a wish and send it on a prayer
We know our dreams can all come true
With love that we can share

With you I never wonder
Will you be there for me
With you I never wonder
You're the right one for me

I finally found the love of a lifetime
A love to last my whole life through
I finally found the love of a lifetime
Forever in my heart
I finally found the love of a lifetime

With every kiss, our love is like brand new
And every star up in the sky
Was made for me and you
Still we both know that the road is long
We know that we will be together
Because our love is strong

I finally found the love of a lifetime

And now you've gone and changed it all with just a kiss

I held back but you held on

A love without fences, a love without walls
A love where we're taking and giving it all
A love without limits where we can be free
To follow our hearts wherever they lead
Baby, that's why we're here to love without fear

I lose myself in your touch
And finally I find that I am strong enough
To listen to this voice within
Telling me to throw all caution to the wind

I had so much to show
I was like an open book

So much I wanted you to know

All you had to do was pay some attention
All you had to do was look past the surface
But you never noticed much of anything
All you had to do was just try to listen
All you ever did was just catch a glimpse
And the tragedy is that you left so much unseen
You left so much unseen

You know my favorite color's blue
When I wear something new
And my favorite song
You didn't know my biggest fear
Was that you didn't care
That this ain't the life I want
To be right by your side
And have this great divide
We were close but so far

All you had to do was pay some attention
All you had to do was look past the surface

Katie Cassidy,"I was sleeping and right in the middle of a good dream
Like all at once I wake up from something that keeps knocking at my brain
Before I go insane I hold my pillow to my head
And spring up in my bed screaming out the words I dread
I think I love you (I think I love you)

This morning I woke up with this feeling
I didn't know how to deal with and so I just decided to myself
I'd hide it to myself and never talk about it
And did not go and shout it when you walked into the room
I think I love you (I think I love you)

I think I love you so what am I so afraid of
I'm afraid that I'm not sure of a love there is no cure for

I think I love you isn't that what life is made of
Though it worries me to say that I never felt this way

I don't know what I'm up against
I don't know what it's all about
I got so much to think about

Hey, I think I love you so what am I so afraid of
I'm afraid that I'm not sure of a love there is no cure for

I think I love you isn't that what life is made of
Though it worries me to say I never felt this way

Believe me you really don't have to worry
I only wanna make you happy and if you say ""hey go away"" I will
But I think better still I'd better stay around and love you
Do you think I have a case let me ask you to your face
Do you think you love me?

I think I love you

I think I love you

While I'm alone and blue as can be

Katie Cat,"I'm as restless as a willow in a windstorm
I'm as jumpy as a puppet on a string
I'd say that I had spring fever
But I know it isn't spring

I am starry-eyed and vaguely discontented
Like a nightingale without a song to sing
Oh, why should I have Spring fever
When it isn't even spring?

I keep wishing I were somewhere else
Walking down a strange new street
Hearing words that I have never heard
From a girl I've yet to meet

I'm as busy as a spider spinning daydreams
I'm as giddy as a baby on a swing
I haven't seen a crocus or a rosebud or a robin on the wing
But I feel so gay in a melancholy way
That it might as well be spring

I hear the clock tick and think of you
Caught up in circles
Confusion is nothing new
Flash back warm night, almost left behind
Suitcase of memories
Time after

Sometime you pictured me
I'm walking too far ahead
You're calling to me
I can't hear what you've said
Then you said, ""go slow, I fall behind""

If you're lost you can look
And you will find me, time after time
If you fall I will catch you
I'll be waiting, time after time

Secrets stolen from deep inside
The drum beats out of time

And by His side the virgin maid
Attending on the Lord of Life
Who came to earth to end all strife",The Wexford Carol,2003

It lies beneath a shade of blue
It struck me so violently

To feel that magic in your hand
To me you're like a wild rose

I cried for you
When the sky cried for you
And when you went
I became a hopeless drifter
But this life was not for you
Though I learned from you,
That beauty need only be a whisper

With your treasure, a secret for me to hold

In many years they may forget
This love of ours or that we met,
They may not know
How much you meant to me.

And the sky cried for you,
And when you went

And I know you've gone away
But in my heart you'll always stay.

It lies beneath a shade of blue 
It struck me so violently

I cried for you 
When the sky cried for you 
And when you went 
I became a hopeless drifter 
But this life was not for you 
Though I learned from you, 
That beauty need only be a whisper 

I'll cross the sea for a different world, 
With your treasure, a secret for me to hold 

In many years they may forget 
This love of ours or that we met, 
They may not know 
how much you meant to me.

And the sky cried for you, 
And when you went

Without you now I see, 
How fragile the world can be 
And I know you've gone away

There's no wind there, they assume
I guess conspiracies are nothing new,
But I'm sure I've been there with you.

And I don't believe that in space
The only life is here on earth
How could we be the only race
That loves and hates 'til death from birth?

But I do believe in love,
Though I should never rely on love
Nothing else excites me,
But loving you.

Is it true a politician's heart
Can rust away and fall apart?
I guess it must be hard,
It must be hard,
To know what's good
And to know what's easy

You might think it's strange,
For all my wild ideas,
But I do not believe that change,
Can ever happen without tears.

You are the angel with whom I would gladly live in sin,
Thanks for being exactly what it says on the tin.
I never doubted, and though I never shouted from the roof,
All about it, I'm with you every day as living proof.

Katie Melua,"Missing the train every morning at 8:52,
Sipping coffee from the same cup as you.
The sharing of secrets we thought no one else knew,
That's what I miss about you.

The new way that love had made me see,
Your bashful grin when you asked if I would like your key.
The knowing way you used to caress me,
That's what I miss about you.

You stole in with your starry smile exciting me,
Driving with you in your new car, feeling free.
If it's true that love is blind, then I was blind willingly,
You made me feel we had a future, that could be and would be.

The way you said I'd be no one on my own,
Your habit of soaking yourself in over-priced cologne.
The way you turned the light out when I knew you were home,
That's what I don't miss about you.

I bet you're using your weary magic like it's new,
Driving so fast with a new fool beside you.
Presumably believing she's the last of the lucky few,
I wonder if she knows she's being lied to like I do.

The way I only doubted myself when I was with you,
Like I was a fool for expecting something from life too.
Your skill of putting me down in-front of everyone we knew,
That's what I don't miss about you",What I Miss About You,2008
Katie Melua,"The thing that makes me feel the most down,
Is the feeling that I'm living in a ghost town.
Barn door bangin' in my face,
Like tumbleweed,
I'm rolling 'round this place.

I see you arriving at the station,
But it's only my imagination.
So I'm begging on my knees,
Turn around,
And save me, baby, please.

From this ghost town,
I feel like giving in,
Since you left I'm living in,
An old ghost town.

Hey kid, I remember all the laughter,
Especially when we woke the morning after.
Why did you have to go away,
Leaving me to wander every day.

In this ghost town,
I feel like giving in,
Since you left I'm living in,
An old ghost town.

We were born to ride,
Side by side.
We are always reaching for the stars,
And they can still be ours.

(If you free me from this)

Ghost town,
I feel like giving in,
Since you left I'm living in,
An old ghost town.
I feel like giving in.
Since you left I'm living in,

Katie Melua,"They say the world must end somehow,
They say the end's not far from now;
I think they're wrong,
Don't worry your life away,
Start living for today,
Don't think about tomorrow.

And if the lights go out on all of us,
In just a year or two.
And if the sky falls down like pouring rain,
Then I'll be here with you.
I'll go down with you.

Well I'm gonna try for all I'm worth,
To stay with you till the end of the earth.
Don't let me down,
Don't let your feelings win.
Don't give out, and don't give in,
Don't think about tomorrow.

Katie Melua,"I see trees that are green red roses too
I watch them bloom for me and you
And I think to myself what a wonderful world

I hear babies cry I watch them grow
And they'll learn much more than I'll ever know
And I think to myself oh what a wonderful world

The colors of the rainbow so pretty in the sky
Are also on the faces of the people passing by
I see friends shaking hands saying how do you do
But they're really saying I love you

If I did I would weep

When you taught me how to dance 
Years ago with misty eyes 
Every step and silent glance 
Every move a sweet surprise 

Someone must have taught you well 
To beguile and to entrance 
For that night you cast your spell 
And you taught me how to dance

I recall what went before 
As I give, I'll learn to take 
And to be alone no more 

Other lights may light my way 
I may even find romance 
But I won't forget that night

Cold winds blow 
But on those hills you'll find me

And I hope that I will. 
Sometimes we're thrown off our pathways 
What I thought was my way home 
Wasn't the place I know 
I'm certain nothing's certain 
What we own becomes our prison 
My possessions will be gone 
Back to where they came from 

Blame, no one is to blame 
As natural as the rain that falls 
Here comes the Flood again 

See the rock that you hold onto 
Is it gonna save you 
When the earth begins to crumble? 
Why do you feel you have to hold on? 
Imagine if you let go 

Blame, no one is to blame 
As natural as the rain that falls 
Here comes the Flood again 

Wash away the weight that pulls you down 
Ride the waves that free you from the dusk? 

Don't trust your eyes 
It's easy to believe them 
Know in your heart 
That you can leave your prison 

Don't trust your mind 
It's not always listening 
Turn on the lights 
And feel the ancient rhythm 

Don't trust your eyes 
It's easy to believe them 
Know in your heart 
That you can leave your prison 

Blame, no one is to blame 
As natural as the rain that falls
