Godsmack,"One time is all it takes to want me 
One time is all it takes to think you're the only
One might believe that I might care
One night is all I need to make you disappear

I always hate the way you love me
I always seem to love what never can be mine
I need to hurt myself so I can feel
Something just one time

I'll throw you in and keep you closely
Then spit you out and make you feel like you owe me
Your heart I'll use to heal my pain
So hard for me to feel like anything or any way

I always hate the way you love me
I always seem to love what never can be mine
I need to hurt myself so I can feel
Something just one time

I always hate the way you love me
I always seem to love what never can be mine
I need to hurt myself so I can feel
I always curse myself when something's real
I need to hurt myself so I can feel
Something just one time",Just One Time,2018
Godsmack,"I took a little breather of my own
I might be too far-gone
Little fragments of my life
I'm slowly dying

Trying not to be so far from home 
But will I be there alone
Fragile pieces of my mind
I'm feeling paralyzed
Compromised

So let it out, let it go
Just spit it out straight till I'm not breathing
Let it out, take it whole
Just let it, I'll find a way to be

So let it out, let it go
Just spit it out straight till I'm not breathing
Let it out, take it whole
Just let it, I'll find a way to be
Way to be

Critical decisions took too long
My promises are strong
Watching loyalties divide
So I'm taking back my life
Golden visions from now on
Can't carry you along
No more explanations why
I've erased and dramatized
Neutralized

So let it out, let it go
Just spit it out straight till I'm not breathing
Let it out, take it whole
Just let it, I'll find a way to be

So let it out, let it go
Just spit it out straight till I'm not breathing
Let it out, take it whole
Just let it, I'll find a way to be
A way to be

So let it all out, let it all go
Let it out, let it all out
So let it all out, let it all go
Let it out, let it all out
So let it all out, let it all go
Let it out, let it all out
So let it all out, let it all go
Let it out, let it all out
Let it out

So let it out, let it go
Just spit it out straight till I'm not breathing
Let it out, take it whole
Just let it, I'll find a way to be

So let it out, let it go
Just spit it out straight till I'm not breathing
Let it out, take it whole
Just let it, I'll find a way to be",Let It Out,2018
Godsmack,"You let the poison running through your veins
You're addicted to the pain and the shame
I'm chasing the same game every day
Who don't know your bullshit and your vanity

Blind decisions, no regrets 
A bittersweet of toxic sweat

You take my pride, taking chances on my life
Never insist, but in time
You just wait, you're gonna say my name
Break this bind, cut my losses
No more carrying all your crosses, come in time
You just wait, you're gonna say my name
Oh you're gonna say my name

A normal situation in disguise
Dragging me through your self inflicted lies
Too bad you're never gonna win this game
Your misery's your only friend and you're to blame

Blind decisions, no regrets
A bittersweet of toxic sweat

You take my pride, taking chances on my life
Never insist, but in time
You just wait, you're gonna say my name
Break this bind, cut my losses
No more carrying all your crosses, come in time
You just wait, you're gonna say my name
Oh, you're gonna say my name

Bringing everybody down, down, down
You turn around
Into the same games, just hit it upside down
Another go-around, you're gonna say my name
It's gonna come around
Yeah, bringing everybody down, down, down
and turn around
Into the same games, just hit it upside down
Another go-around, you're gonna say my name
You're gonna say my name, say my name

You take my pride, taking chances on my life
Never insist, but in time
You just wait, you're gonna say my name
Break this bind, cut my losses
No more carrying all your crosses, come in time
You just wait, you're gonna say my name
Oh, bitch, say my name
You know you're gonna say my name
Oh, say my name",Say My Name,2018
Godsmack,"Living with these shadows
Separating what I've done
And chasing the illusions
Of who I once was
Too much time, too many places
Different lives and different faces
Stripping down and bracing for a change

A better life, I'm searching for
A better life, I'm searching for

Someday I'll begin to live my life
I pray I'm okay for now
At least I'm breathing, I'm dying
I'm reaching through myself
For another way
I can win and live my life again
Someday

Looking for a sign as desperation sets within
Boredom starts to blend into another sin
All this time, all this weather
Drink my wine, I'm no better
Everything around me stays the same

A better life, I'm searching for

Someday I'll begin to live my life 
I pray I'm okay for now
At least I'm breathing, I'm dying
I'm reaching through myself
For another way
I can win and live my life again
Someday

Searching for a life, I need to know
I'm searching for a part of me to follow
Too many people with their hands on me
None of which I really give a shit about anyway

Shedding all my skin to start again and again
Shedding all my skin to start again and again
Shedding all my skin to start again and again
Shedding all my skin to start again and again

Someday I'll begin to live my life
I pray I'm okay for now
At least I'm breathing, I'm dying
I'm reaching through myself
For another way
I can win and live my life again
Someday

Someday",Someday,2018
Godsmack,"Driving my fist down deep inside it, oh yeah
Gonna take it to a whole new level in spite of the bullshit (Baby)
Tasting sweet anxiety, breaking through a melody
Maybe I just don't care anymore what you think of me

I'll take it to the edge
I'll take it to the other side
I'll hear you screaming 
It's coming alive
I'll take it to the edge
I'll take it to the other side
I feel it breathing
Deep down inside
Deep down inside

Tearing through shards of broken glass, oh yeah
Getting one step closer to the edge and taking it all back (Baby)
Searching through my blackened veins, uncontrolled in a different way
I can't wait to away from everything

I'll take it to the edge
I'll take it to the other side
I'll hear you screaming
It's coming alive

Godsmack,"Do we make sense, I think we do
In spite of everything that we've been through
Oh and you say black and I say white
It's not about who's wrong 
As long as it feels right
Don't think those stars won't align

Under your scars I pray
You're like a shooting star in the rain
You're everything that feels like home to me, yeah
Under your scars, I could live inside you time after time
If you'd only let me live inside your mind
Live inside your mind

Wish you were here
Right beside me
So I could watch you sleep
Hold you body closer, breathe you deep
And everything feels broken
When you're not next to me
Would you still be you
If we weren't we

Under your scars I pray
You're like a shooting star in the rain
You're everything that feels like home to me, yeah
Under your scars, I could live inside you time after time

So hey, if you feel like coming down
If you feel like coming around
Just call my name out loud, na, na, na

Another change is coming
A separation from defiant

Alone I try with words unspoken
Silent cry, my breath is frozen
With blinded eyes, I fear myself

It's burning down, it's burning high
When ashes fall the legends rise
We burned it out oh my oh why
When ashes fall the legends rise

Throat is dry, my vision's fading

Taking time just one step forward
Won't lose my mind, I'm here to stay

Ah look at all the lonely people

Eleanor Rigby, picks up the rice
In the church where a wedding has been
Lives in a dream
Waits at the window, wearing the face 
That she keeps in a jar by the door
Who is it for

All the lonely people
Where do they all come from?
All the lonely people
Where do they all belong?

Father McKenzie, writing the words
Of a sermon that no one will hear
No one comes near
Look at him working, darning his socks
In the night when there's nobody there
What does he care

All the lonely people
Where do they all come from?
All the lonely people
Where do they all belong?

Ah look at all the lonely people
Ah look at all the lonely people

And was buried along with her name

From his hands as he walks from the grave
No one was saved

Godstar,"Another spring, another love
Where do these flowers all come from
Another girl has one my heart this time
I start to come across,
As if I have never lost,
Those feelings that you give to someone else
Another spring I'm not in love.

It's just something you can not plan
Suddenly you find yourself holding hands
Another weak spot, whepped for years
Until it finally disappears
Fades away all the dirt is lost
The flowers dry easy to crush
Another spring this must be love.

And I know I never find it better
Lying here right next to you,
Another spring now we're together
'Cause it's so easy to do.

Another spring, another love
Where do these flowers all come from
Another girl has one my heart this time
I start to come across,
As if I have never lost,
Those feelings that you give to someone else

Godwin,"The sleepless nights - the daily fights
The quick toboggan - when you reach the heights
I miss the kisses - and I miss the bites
I wish I were in love again

The broken dates - the endless waits
The lovely loving - and the hateful hates
The conversation - with the flying plates
I wish I were in love again

No more pain - no more strain
Now I'm sane - but I would rather be punch - drunk

The pulled out fur - of cat and cur
The fine mismatching - of a him and her
I've learned my lesson - but I wish I were
In love again

The furtive sigh - the blackened eye
The words: ""I love you - 'til the day I die""
The self deception - that believes the lie
I wish I were in love again

When love congeals - it soon reveals
The faint aroma - of performing seals
The double-crossing - of a pair of heels
I wish I were in love again

No, no more care - no, no despair
Now I'm all there (now) - but I'd rather be punch drunk

Believe me sir - I much prefer
The classic battle - of a him and her
I don't like quiet - and I wish I were
In love again - in love again - in love again",I Wish I Were in Love Again [From Babes in Arms],2001

You're vicious and romantic;
These are a few of my favorite things.
All of those favors and this is what you choose.
Pass the blues, pass the blues,
And onto something new.

Something real,
Make it timeless.
An act of God and nothing less will be accepted. 
So if you're calling me out,
Then count me out. 

You were stubborn and mellow dramatic,
A real class act.
You see I know a few of your favorite things.
Five in the morning and out comes out pouring love
Out the same way in. 

Something real,
Make it timeless.
An act of God and nothing less will be accepted.

Godz Gift,"[Kazi] 
I'm down with all the illest  ain't no crabs all around me 
So put your head together  you still couldn't find me 
Where I be and how I live is ill 

[Madlib] 
Hey yo  niggas always talkin' bout there shit is real 
""I gotta flex with a Lex in my video"" 
That's what half of these rappers be thinking in every city, yo 

[Kazi] 
Yeah, you want to fight don't ya, you want to bite don't ya? 
The involvement of a new coast is here 
To take your soul, rearrange it with flows 
You're unknown, come across our line, you get blown 
Too many bids, ain't no puttin' together 
Restorin' your body parts, leaving the rest for whatever 

[Madlib] 
You talking bout you want to freestyle, you want to flow 
But your flow be like oil and water, it don't mix 
And you don't even know you're waiting for your rhyme fix 
But my mind sticks, my rhyme hits, your mind gets 
Amputated, 'cause your style ain't even Hip Hop related 

[Kazi] 
This be the Kazi, my niggas call me Kaz 
How does it feel to be mixed up and lost? 
First of all, you shouldn't have bit the next rapper 
Now your mind's confused, you lose, talkin' bout you paid dues 

[Madlib] 
Slay crews, when you ain't even at phase two 
Talking about take two? You only get one take 
Yo, my boys just run fakes, run ya out of my estates 
Plus they just might take ya papes, plus you won't remember no plates 
So don't have no mistakes, steppin' over this way 

[Kazi] 
Second to last, but not least, hey yo, Kazi's here to rip it 
I'll take MC's, tie 'em up, and then split 
It's like this, yo I'm up on some bliz 
Total techniques for the hip hop kids 

[Madlib] 
Yo we puttin' the lid on ya, if you're wack you're a goner 
Cause we on a war path, droppin' math 'cause we only want to 
Keep this hip hop real, innovatin' new styles 
Takin' out wack MC's by the piles, for real 

Episode #2: God's Gift 

I have no strings to hold me down
Beware of the Tupperware 
It's the limited edition, prime series hum via tell a sport brain 
Who came complete with all terrain capabilities 
Track trail blazing a path of traveling freely 
Beyond the vanity of border impedance hindering 
Progress intending to enhance those plagued with 
Recessive styles, relying on primal rage 
Disengaged pushing trivial, unimportant material 
Virtually there, but still visually impaired 
Point of views defusing the output of ya outlook 
Confusing ya confidence, 'cause you dwell on surface knowledge 
Dig deeper into my speech or the only way you'll learn 
Is to have a translator explain my rhymes in layman's terms 
We now have confirmation, pure order has swarmed 
Like locusts consuming all vegetation 
Into waste land fills fresh water wells seeping 
Poisonous corrosion as a business proposition 
Exposing flesh in nuclear explosions 
Forming glowing boils at the point of contact of deforming 
The surviving population as mass rotations 
Resulting from advanced hip hop experimentation's 
On the island of Madlib Monroe 
CDP pouring beats down your throat that dissolve your vital organs 


Episode #3: Declaime 

I'm cool with who I be, Lyric slanger from CDP 
Got shit locked up like slaves out at sea 
Ya lost to the way I come across at all costs, I must get mine 
Suck up all the sun rays and then outshine 
Till I blind all eye sights all over the planet 
When I rhyme right, I out stand it 
Cool with my ways, so chilled that most can't stand it 
y'all knows me, the rhyme wise who stays high 
With forty's in my lap bust that old school boom bap 
All over this map, for I be that down ass, South Cali poet, 
Ya know it to be The D-E-see-L-A-I-M-E, 
Doing my thing in this ring 
Knockin' niggas down with what I bring 
Crazy chaos your way off 
So swing ya partners are around 
Do the hump to my sound 
Fuck it, all panties down to ya ankles 
Bending back ass over microphone entangles 
Strangles all ya got chokes like chronic smoke 
I'll take a toke and pass it to all my niggas, 
to all my niggas, take two and pass 


Episode #4: Medaphoar and Oh No 

[Chorus: Medaphoar] 
Everyday it's like a level in this game that we live 
Gotta struggle to survive, that's why some MC's get blitzed 
Situations got your mind in control, that's how you roll 
But don't step to M-E-D, because your rhymes will be fold 

[Medaphoar] 
Straight in all black on the attack be Medaphoar so freeze back 
So rappin' imitators get peeled back when I'm in combat 
I got them rhymes to make ya shake the spot when Medaphoar's near 

My rhyme's been set to blow up different spots so MC's stand clear 
I fear no MC's alive because my dangerous rhyme 
Survives battles worldwide, until my cities recognize 
For every rhyme that's built to self destruct three seconds after the buck 
Niggas better duck, or take that risk to get stuck 
It's this do or die mentality that keeps ya mouth frying 
Sippin on the E&J and smoking blunts stuffed with Hawaiian Chronic 
For my homey Shack in SB, rhymes on the shiesty 
Niggas on the run when Medaphoar is on the gun 
MC's out to get me from all of the battles I won 
Med, comin from the west, so represents where I'm from 
Lyrically I got your block locked when I drop this hip hop 
Fresh out the west to twist you up because the rhyme don't stop 

[Chorus]

[Oh No]
In this game, I ain't trying to see that wack rhyme bacteria 
That's some next shit, material starts external 
But also interior when y'all frauds claim imperial 
Breaking down your inferior while you listen to your superior 
Some niggas know me as ""Oh No"" 
But in reverse in ya in the middle, I'm ""on ya ho"" 
So slow your roll because I fold emcees like rheumatism 
Syndrome and break 'em down like compression when I be up in 'em 
I skip more MC's than scratch compilations CD's 
To have your speech in verbal poetical lyrical oddities 
The heart's cold to make hell freeze, slash hot like a flame 
I spread like dead grass up in the hills so run for your ass 
I'm known as assassin from the west livin' it up 
Kaliwild shakin up the best, messing 'em up 
This nigga's known as metaphor and I be the disrupt 
Vocally tearing you up from the ground up 
 

Episode #5: Wild Child 

[Chorus: Wild Child]
When you bust that rhythmic freestyle flow to be that abstract 
You bust back flips, lyrically you'll get asked that 
Is y'all crew rally all that when you bump that 
Track by Lootpack, ya like ""They off the hook, cat"" 

[Wild Child] 
Focus, Wild Child representative of hip hop, top 10 niggas get mopped 10 times 
My rhymes will transform into 30 thin lines 'cause I feep I'm 
The responsible obstacle 
For you non-freestyling MC's kickin' lots of bull 
I rock shit till the Eucalyptus 
Flaunt it like, haunt ya mic to the point ya mic tells you, 
""You can't rip this"" I'll get it exited and, get the crowd hyped and 
Slap you up with my right hand and 
Find out you're a little white man with a slight tan 
Wild Child'll take ya ass out like lightning 
Fresh in the flesh, steadily enlightening this mic 
The fact that you lack the respect, got the mad knack of incompetence 
Step to Jack and get smacked to lower your whole lack of confidence 
Ya bro's out there know you have no composure 
You unnoticibly slide to the back of thee 
Open mic session with ya little wack faculty 
Thirty minutes, prior to getting there, claiming you had the knack to be 
The dopest MC, that was the most inactively 
Statement you ever said to Jack, you see 
The day you took hip hop into ya hands was an act of lunacy 
So, if ya feel me, yo if ya feel me, party people say it 
""La La La La"", come on, come on, come on, come on... 
my people say ""La La La La"" 

[Chorus]",Episodes,1999
Godz Gift,"Hah Hahahah... 
From the dungeons of darkness 
Comes God's Gift to Hip Hop 
Representin' with the LP 

We'll hit 'em hard and fast in a straight line 
Concentrating all firepower to their blindside at sunrise 
Operation sunray  UV radiation 
First breach their outer barriers then continue penetration 
To their central point  crushin' their nucleus 
Rushing their central brain command 
Planting a virus that expands 
Through your whole nervous system shutting down all communications 
To your ya bodily functions Handicapping your defenses 
Swiftly attacking your unit, Neutralizing MC's 
By ripping 'em apart before they even know what hit 'em

High above controlling stratus clouds, my man God's Gift 
Come down, assist us, wack MC's must be reminded 
Get a Lootpack tape, rewind it, for those closed minded 
To the abstract we kick, we rock all places 
I found out MC's aren't human 'cause they got two faces 
They be chillin', willin', always time killin' 
Wack rumor spillin' while Jack be still in charge 
Asking me if I smoke chronic, niggas it's ironic 
I'm Wild Child, 80% human, 20% bionic 
My main occupation is to step up and rock the nation 
Focus up upon my jam and blow up just like inflation 
So if you ain't down, don't front, worry about your health 
Worry about your wack crew and ya wack ass self 

Ay yo, here comes the Master Don, here to renovate 
My style hits ya like marble weights so pass the dinner plate 
But pass up the swine like money ya rhyme lime 
Madlib done told ya time and time again 
Find the mental maze, faster ya plaster your instrumental 
With lyrical disaster till you scream out ""Who's the master?"" 
I flip it up rip it up to raw addict, 
Crate diggin' for the static when I mad beat shop 
Impulse down to prestige and Black Jazz 
21st Century enja got mad 
Record labels of the old, ill loop and take 'em out 
I keep it secret when a nigga tries to peep shit 
My beat hit like a Roy Jones Jr. skit 
Your girl starin so now you want to flip 
I rip it down to the Loot while ya yell peace 
While I pull out my piece, yell peace but now leave ya in pieces 
But at least you escaped this beast 
Smokin' on a cushin' leaf while ya try to bring grief 

Now something's shaking in the palace, can't you feel the Santa Ana 
Switching currents and building velocity, it got's to be 
God's Gift and Lootpack, mentally superior master race of lyricists 
Conductiong verbal experiments 
With open and imaginitive creativity 
Fathering styles from infancy to be lyrically 
Complete, grown and fully developed adults 
Trained in mastering total blitz coastal, total assaults 
Also we launch all out war when we tour your area 
First destroying your local underground spots 
Rocked your major clubs and plugged into your theatres 
Advancing as hip hop's vocabulary leaders 
Hostile take-overs is our main focus 
As the deadliest of CDP special attack forces 
Basically, MC's lack division is appalling 
Third rate styles with the nerve to say they're vocalists 
Out of focus, often it's the people they run with 
Coupled with their own wackness, they're futureless!

If music doesn't come from windows
You know that something's definitely wrong
(It's fucking wrong)
And all the cars, they pass in silence

And if there is no guitar in a house
You know its owner, he cannot be trusted
And if there is no drum set in the office
Don't be surprised when the business get busted

And if your spouse doesn't play a sitar
Don't expect a whole lot of commitment
And if President doesn't play the sax
He will not get an under-table treatment

And in this gutter town
Say you kick somebody in the head
They just, they likely sue you
But man, they don't get mad

So that's when I pull over a taxi-co

We realize that difference is none
It's underdogs who, and if you want it
You always have to make your own fun

And as the upperdog leisurely sighing
The local cultures are dying and dying
The programmed robots are buying and buying
And a psycho load of freaks they are still trying trying

Ooohoohoooh through the roof, underground

And as the boy scouts learn to read between the lines
The silver rabbits hop between their fathers' lies
And boy scouts ask ""Where? Where do they go?""
They go to the country that they only know

Just like their meanings they lay between the lines
Between the borders their real countries hide
The strategigo's saw their advertise
Their strategy of being is one of in-your-face disguise

And all the systems will be discumbumbled,

Where joys and freedom they can not be tried

But you just never go there when you are awake
When most of the time whatever that you look for
You could of just sit down and make
So do ""the right thing"". just do ""the right thing""
How can you do it if you are awake?!
Instead I scratch my forehead like Aladdin his lamp...

We'll find some shack below radar
Put two turntables and a film projector in that room
And punk rock 'n' roll most faithfully...

And stick your beak in the seeds your master laid
Where did they came from? Who put them in there?
Oh you will never know their name!
But there is a room where bustle and merry
And big ceremony could be going on,
Where your true talents along with birthrights
Could be dancing can-can

How many final frontiers
We gonna mount
And maybe no victory laps

Where is the musicians that got the taste?

Where's the band that like fanfare? Gonna keep it going 24 hour

Instead it's 1 in the morning and DJ's patching up the chords
Everybody's full of cake, staring at the floor
Proper couples start to mumble that it's time to go
People gotta get up early and they gotta go

Ah, people gotta get up early and she's got a boyfriend
And this whole fucking thing is one huge disappointment
And nothing gets these bitches going, not even gypsy kings
Nobody talks about my super theory of super everything

So be Donald Trump or be an anarchist

Unstoppable fire of my tongue
And the path ahead that's long
Will get me at the end where I belong

Sinking in the dunes
As I dragged my coffin on the rope

Them all look down at me
But I got all the help I need
'Cause the last one, last one goes the hope
Last one, last one goes the hope

Unseizable diamond from my sling
Still is searching for its ring
In a city of ruins where no one sings

But zombies and willful slaves
Living in their tiny private caves
Crooked hands digging up the graves

Yeah, I've seen ship of fools
Sinking in the dunes
As I dragged my coffin on the rope

To the working man dance hall
Where all night we played piano-yano-yano
Off the chairs about to fall
Then we climbed the ladder to the attic
Where once I showed her my first song
Above the street where all them crazy dreamers
Still talking nonsense all night long

And we recited sacred text
And we rose and we fell
And then we said, ok what's next?

But, if you keep on watching trains

I take a sword in my hand now
I fight & kill Thanatos
Feel the ground under your feet
The roots so deep

Every step I chose to make
Was just a kind of torture
I changed my ways
Now positive the fear became

Can't control my arms
Emergy too strong, I feel
Hypnotize myself, Blood boils inside

As clear, as real, as I protect
Nothingness is all around

Disturbs my brain, I want to dive in...

Overcome with cold I pray

Cannot see the stars
Images, colors, like wrong perfection
Wash my brain, dirty it's so clean
But who are you?
The mixture has no smell

Soon you will sit on the bench
Of those who deny I have my soul
You sell a dream you create
Condemned by what you condemned before
Smooth are the words you sing down and high
Underground is your joy your laws

You choose the appeerance of the futile
Trapped, a coner stops your back, you're out
Before you grow you will die...

Spinning round inside of me, deep inside
Revolving conscious planet
On an axis around this star
By the light

And the black holes in the vault of heaven
Make me wonder, wonder why
How matter can disappear
Are there doors in this wall to reach the light
From time and space

Now I see those mounts of fear
Feel the weight of nonsense killing simplicity
I can touch this wind of night
That erases our light and makes us paranoiac
But my legs are now so tired
Climbing all alone, all space, and all the time
So I fix my attention now
On this perfect planet revolving around this star
And the sun, it seems so close
I can touch the heat of presence and I know...
I can see this monster light
That embraces those notions : space and time

The black holes in the sky, I ask the reasons why
Light blackened? Door opened?
Swim back time, door giving entrance to
Supernova as only light
Meet the earth and all the stars
The entrance, the essence, supply us

And that's inside of me

And none can rebuild it

And I fall in disgrace

I hold my inner child within
And tell him not to cry
""don't fear the living""

And now fear can erase
This light below us
Each one of us is now engaged
This secret we all have
This truth is growing
And as a warrior I have to fight
I can already feel
The love I'll discover

I had this dream, our planet surviving
The guiding stars always growing
And all the worlds
The fates all the countries
They're all rebuilding at the same time

On the frontier not to cross

Enter in 
The realm of nothingness 
I feel the cold, my eyes are shut

Are my thoughts and cages 
I can hear their moan 
But now a long deep breath 
Is calling

That they never can fall

In silver grey sky 
Wild river flows 
With rage alive 
Lions of fire approach me 

Carved by the wind 
And the fall of water 
From the treetops 
I can see the end of a time

Made of rock and mist

Gojira,"I'm in a mental cage,
I'm locked up
Imprisoned I live,
Deathlike, sickening
Strong is your hold
On my resignation
I don't see the stars,
My memories are veiled

In fluid dreams
I fall I'm restless
Walls made of stone
Are turned into water now
Enlightened demons
Are taking me by the hand
Approaching me,
The great eye speaking

Mountainous waves
Are breaking on my despair
Awaken me but I'm still dreaming
And I just plunge
Into this sea of light
Set open the doors of soul
I'm living

Lightning struck me
I see the path I was so scared of
And fly to the stars
Conviction now increasing at last
My skin is broken
I see the smallest part of me
My mind is alive
But I'll never bow to this again

Why do they call me there
How can I fly to
All this water
I don't fell like
I could ever swim to them
Whales in the sky
I feel they're so close
Inside, and yet so far away
Burst into tears, I feel sad
My dreams aflame
The force is now away
Lie on a stone,
Drop this load and cry to see
The ocean planet is on burn

To another I fly
I come with life in my veins
Through darkened space I ran
I left a struggle behind

To find the gates of the heart

I come to Sirius see
To learn from you friends of old
And wish to come into being
And behold I?m with you

I lay down by the river-flow
It's a river of stars
I'm living by the ocean

This place around us
It's a world that I once saw
In a dream

Will you please tell me now
If I'm dead or alive

All around
It's a city of light
Were who when and why ?
I think therefore I am

But ages after
I know the world
Will overcome its' pain

I dream about it
Already makes it
Happen in the rain


It's right in front
But you don't face it
I'm dedicated
All my life in me
And made of light
Our sun is growing

Is not the only one

Consequence is upon my door
Responsible for my own life
I'm reborn again and again

Driven to increase my own power
By creation the purest choice
Destined to rule my life
And go the way of the flesh

Without any hope left
But now I decide to grab my life
With my hands
Crave for freedom build my own life

Reaction is a weakness the strong cannot afford
My path is not determined by actions of others
They fill themselves with hate
Covering their faces blackened
The wolves are back and crave to kill
Slip on stones and break their legs
Try to hide from termination
But the time has come
You will have to pay the debt of nature

And now you are the one
To change the face of the world
You wield the sword the pain is left aside

So I refine the way I that I know
So bright to me
And I only adore the fact that we are the
Creators
Of our own lives
Lust for power is the master disease of our time
This force alone devours the weak
And rules the strongest

And the waves so big, I'm not prepared
I will have to be strong
But for now I cry all the tears

Now enter the storm and feel electric sword
My entire life is about to burn
I am struggling, life is illusion
But I keep the dream of a better time

This secret knowledge I receive from where I am
So precious, the treasured icons
Extended to this point, forget the ones that hurt
They all want, they struggle, they fight and try to dry their tears

We're all left on our own
We are bound yet by each others lives

Losing contact with the living

Don't see anything real in the game

The tension is building constantly
No reason just a reflex I have, driven by clockwork
I try to keep an eye open
And I realize I haven't closed my eyes in a long time

Neglected emotions leading to catastrophic voyage on the other side
I have been given so much stress and lack of confidence
I've been given the gift of so small hope deep inside
I haven't close my eyes in a long time, I am trying

I cannot stomach these forms and colors anymore
But I'm here to continue, after all I have been through
I try to keep my eyes open, I am realizing
This life and death more precious than anything

I won't bring no material in the after life
Take no possessions, I would rather travel light
I'm of this kind that kills all day
But I don't know yet how to die

Misunderstand each other, out of control we remain
There is a mystery, we're facing a sight to behold
This is what we make of the world, we throw everything away

The way we all behave is not understandable
It is so sad to see the wealth of our planet fade away
We all behave like children, taking off the head of our
Teddy bear to see what's inside, taking, not giving back

We drain the oceans and suck all the blood out of the soil
We spend the time we have left fighting and killing each other
Lust for comfort, entertainment becomes an obsession
And there is so much time to kill

The way I see things is so simple
The fact I'm walking, standing on this land
Exhausted is the realm of nature, friends are dying
The living creatures on our side

The way I see myself, so confused, so sophisticated
I have to stay away from me
But I still don't get the point, what's worth destroying all the worlds
Try not to get it anymore

You burn yourself, set fire for your own good
We die eyes closed, dig your own grave now
Tossed in the blaze, naked on the flame

Tossed in the blaze, naked on the flame
Lost with no pride, drowned in the filth
The giant snake is coming down to eat our heads
And the flood will kill us, Mantus is rising from under

The shell returns to dust

I focus on the present, concentrate on what I find
Accelerate the vision high beyond the curse of time
Bring light to my attention, the walls of vacuum fall
This force increases and tells me where to go

Follow, I enter my dimension, awakened heart for life
Enforce my senses understanding
I find the will to live straight

I feel the change, I see the vicious circle
Finally turned into a virtuous one
Having the whole world in my hands filled
Timelessness

Out of the frame I feel so vast I'm all around myself

But I keep struggling inside to hold this always
Forever there

Lower and lower is the pressure
I can feel the parts of me collapsing one into the other
Higher state of consciousness awaken
I can see the light of this next world leading my soul reborn

I find it hard to believe that this picture on the wall is everything
I do understand all the prayers, life is so sharp, hurts so bad
What does it mean to be dying, what if you take the guts and brain away?
Is it this blood and heartbeat that you call life

Every effort to ignore it is unavailing, we all have to die
Is it too late to dull the edges of the pain, I have to try
This is an other dimension, you can scatter ashes to the winds
And even buried in the ground I'm still there

Do not be afraid, you are dying and the four great elements
Of your body are collapsing one into the other
It feels as if you are being crushed by mountains
The light of this world has faded completely
But the light of the next world have not yet appeared

Your breath is now still, no warmth to your skin

Swallow the trees, the lakes and all the valleys
Crush the moon and drink the river flowing
Deeper than ocean blue
Burning all that, burning all that

They teach you how to conquer and rule the world
The towers that you built so strong, no man can touch
They tell you how to find and raise the fears
And let them grow inside of your heart, they need no walls

Is there a chance you face the void inside?
Winds of doom will blow your pride away

Behold the bright lights coming down on time
Before these altars black made for your sacrifice

I've killed a part of me that was aching
The pain is gone
But denail runaway from institutions
I owe my self life

Gojira,"On the first light of the day you march on
Departure has arrived, don't look back
Avoid the darkness, stay away, stay out of sight
Until you feel the blast of a shooting star

Following the spark like a rocket in the sky
Between the bear and the scorpion, getting close
Headed north, frozen land, where tigers go to die
Don't fear the cold, it'll numb your memories out

You are higher in the sky

Learn the skill to stay alive, survival
The city is so mean, you're being watched
Reach the tunnel, light the torch, you're on the hunt
Until the light calls you back into the wild

When you get to the other side, please send a sign
It'll fly through the atmosphere in time
And if you hold the truth within your hands
You won't be sent back, through the rain, reborn

Feels So Good like Mase, to pull over
Anywhere I want, diplomats on the Rover
The way I put it on a nigga sober
I have 'em comin' back, knockin' on my door like Johovas
Ya'll already know that Charli's in charge
Weekly massage, platnuim and gold cars
Money stashed in NY to Witchitaw
And I stay with my niggas cause you know how bitches are
Aggy, cause they baby daddy want to bag me
That's why I never leave home without the 44

Pinned up in what?

And it ain't that I'm stuck on myself, I'm really hot

Wear the ice on the bra of my chest
When the money ain't right I go far to the left

want to Long Kiss Goodnight, don't hold ya breath
Bitches know I'm the shit with my MAC lipstick
Crushin' the player haters with a purple navigator
Shoes alligator, my bag is too
If I was broke like you, I would be mad like you
But you can come work for Charli, a boss with a body
Ask anybody, I could take over Gotti
Poo by the poo while you just another hottie

Cause shit for no Charli will be in the breifcase

Ain't no love here, just the black gloves here
Check it, and I don't get by with nothin' I can't leave in 30 seconds
But my kids, they think mommy a teacher
They don't know, for the love of this
I make the whole world tre' dough
Bingo, get 'em ready for school like nothing happen
Here's a apple for the teacher, tell 'em mommy said ""Hi""
Bet he won't fail you no more, one more ""F"" and he die

So when they come lookin' for this reporter broke Un

Remind me of the things we use to do

It never feels quite the same 
And everytime you go 
It hurts a way you'll never know 

I guess your stories 
Make me feel like it's alright now 

Tell me what it's like to be with you 
Remind me of the things we used to do 
And tell me that this time will never end 
Tell me what it's like, tell me again 

Everything I fear 
Shows itself everytime you're here 
And everything I know 
Leaves with you everytime that you go 

I wish your stories 
Could erase all the things that I said 

So tell me what it's like to be with you 
Remind me of the things we use to do 
And tell me that this time will never end 
Tell me what it's like, tell me again 

You look that way (You look that way)
Don't want to see you look that way 
You talk that way (You talk that way)
Don't want to feel this way

Uh huh, Untertainment

Uhh uhh

Verse One: Charli Baltimore

I don't know if it's the pretty face or the expensive taste
That got everybody wantin' to touch me like Case
Feels So Good like Mase, to pull over
Anywhere I want, diplomats on the Rover
The way I put it on a nigga sober
I have 'em comin' back, knockin' on my door like Johovas
Ya'll already know that Charli's in charge
Weekly massage, platnuim and gold cars
Money stashed in NY to Witchitaw
And I stay with my niggas cause you know how bitches are
Aggy, cause they baby daddy want to bag me
That's why I never leave home without the 44
Ya'll hoes can't do nothin' to me
I got this game wrapped like a dubee
Pinned up in what?
Charli rappin' about, I really got
And it ain't that I'm stuck on myself, I'm really hot

Chorus

For the love of money (dollar bills ya'll)
For the love of money (gots to have it, eh-heh)
For the love of money (dollar bills ya'll)
For the love of money (really need it, yeah)

Verse Two: Charli Baltimore

Yo yo yo, gimme the money
Rich bitch be swimmin' in money
I need Jet Ski's in mind, can't tease a dime
Lookin' in the mirror, feeling pleased with the shine
Lady Rolex for the time, the class is ""S""
Wear the ice on the bra of my chest
When the money ain't right I go far to the left
Niggas want to play games then Charli direct
want to Long Kiss Goodnight, don't hold ya breath
Bitches know I'm the shit with my MAC lipstick
Crushin' the player haters with a purple navigator
Shoes alligator, my bag is too
If I was broke like you, I would be mad like you
But you can come work for Charli, a boss with a body
Ask anybody, I could take over Gotti
Poo by the poo while you just another hottie
Niggas roll bricks that'll stay if it's notty

Chorus

For the love of money (dollar bills ya'll)
For the love of money (gots to have it, eh-heh)
For the love of money (dollar bills ya'll)

Verse Three: Charli Baltimore

Uh huh, yo when you look you see the slim waist leavin' no trace
Cause shit for no Charli will be in the breifcase
Yeah Long Kiss Goodnight, Baltimore get it right
For the cash, pop out the window and shoot through the ice
Ain't no love here, just the black gloves here
Check it, and I don't get by with nothin' I can't leave in 30 seconds
But my kids, they think mommy a teacher
They don't know, for the love of this
I make the whole world tre' dough
Bingo, get 'em ready for school like nothing happen
Here's a apple for the teacher, tell 'em mommy said ""Hi""
Bet he won't fail you no more, one more ""F"" and he die
Even with my nails done, I can take guns apart son
So when they come lookin' for this reporter broke Un
Dealt with birds, but I had to move on
But for none of these I tatto the little P-pac on my arm
Ask Un how the ones be when he advance me dough
So I put out mines and tell dawg keep yours yo

Came far from chopping crack in the kitchen
Hated when I was a thug, couldn't understand it
Put me through school, swore soon I'd be in a position to rule

Look at me now, your only child breathing through you
For you, by you, the science of FUBU, ill creation
I'm still laying for that day I wake up
Out of this dream, see you kinetically move, a seventies jewel

A star's born, in the form of man, deep like Elijah
Mommy's only prophet speaking the logic
Now momma love said if I ever get rich
And you not alive, watch for the snakes, 'cause they got to survive

Love your moms, hate the streets
I'll protect you from fears, always be here

To the streets of my house someone not a nine, through hard times
Mom's was so strong you one of my heart's pride
And you told me I would shine in time, never win, but you know
Through you I spit and make the whole globe glow

I zone on all the things you ever did for me, my grief as a kid
Easing my pain, lifting my name, predicting I'll see fame
Change that bond that's never broken
You my heart for life, put ice on the surface of your soul glowing

To my moms straight royal, look at your boy now
Taught me the young, in turn I spoil you now
Don't even worry I'm a hold you down not far from now
When you see me and the way you've been
Just since my born day, and you proud

No matter what, so I'm touched when I spit it this way
I pray you'll be smiling for the rest of your days around
Always at my best, and that's 'cause of you
Always calm and watch you raise me to be top notch

My moms is for my seeds, my moms for me
Always been by my side, when I needed her most
When I was locked in a cell, holding her close

Visit after visit, she will always be there
My father would never cry, wouldn't shed one tear
My mother exact opposite, by all means
And it would hurt, when she see me walking in state greens

I be like ma chill, 'cause it's all good
In just two more year's I'll be back in the hood
My father, he got sick, my mother couldn't take it
She called me the night he died, said he ain't make it

All hysterical, phone dropped off the dresser
Ma you calm down, you got high blood pressure
See I understand that I got to be the man
And take care of my wife, kids, and the fam, specially you ma

Love your moms, hate the streets
I'll protect you from fears, always be here
Love your moms, hate the streets

Mama love, old earth for what it's worth
Sorry for all the times that I made you hurt
I know it was hard work, mother of three
Who would of thought your baby be running the street crazily'

You told me to stick to the dean, I lusted the cream
57 Fav queens with cracks in my jeans
I'm going nowhere fast, that's what you said
Didn't want to lose me to jail over some quick bread, or end up dead

Eyes bloodshed, watching your tears shed
Damn a nigga making his bed
About to lie in, I want to change, but I ain't trying
It ain't justifying, my grand pops dying

Moms, I'm sorry for the pain, there's sunshine after the rain
My past shame it's hard to explain
Can I make you happy' I love to see you smile
For your life while, ma it's our turn now

Loud empty places

On cheap talk and wine

I did what I had to do
And saw it through without exemption

I planned each charted course
Each careful step along the byway
But more, much more than this
I did it my way

Yes, there were times, I'm sure you knew
When I bit off more than I could chew
But through it all, when there was doubt
I ate it up and spit it out
I faced it all and I stood tall
And did it my way

I've loved, I've laughed and cried
Had my fill, my share of losing
And now, as tears subside
I find it all so amusing

Pullin nines on, UFO's, takin they fly clothes
They eyes closed, we gettin loot
No doubt, check the word of mouth, unheard about
Guns go off and now a murder bout
I'm out
My raps play the part like a Get Smart secret agent
In a maze and, styles blazin, Johnny Blaze and Tony Starks in a daze and
Rhymin, my nigga Lou Diamond will wrap it up
We like Meth to go and fuck with Noodles
Havin them poodles on the lockdown buyin me
Amarett-ahs, and chewables, stackin pharmecuetical
Rap niggaz on dust and wools
Yo, I told you, some kill rob and fold
The gold's untold, fuck it it beats parole
So stroll marvelous, soul controller
Of the whole globe, god damn I got it sewn
And yo, whattup pop, pop the suitcase high
And we can talk, you can walk out the fuckin building
And get caught, save the fully inflatable
Rap relatable, drug relatable
Niggaz here to play with you
A hundred dollar Rottweiler goes to spot sellers
Guns and glocks go to niggaz who got props
On top, jail niggaz get mad bigger
And yo, mail a guy about a hundred pictures
Word to momma, this rap wonderama team got drama
Comma, plus smoke realize marijuana
Chef may resign to boat across the Farasana
Immaculate plus all my guns so accurate
They get CREAM and the cuisine in Queens
I told you, money stated with the night beams, and two rings

Who's the Knucklehead, wantin respect?
Chop his fingers in the drug game, money well known
Lead singer, humdinger, flash is the aftermath
Here's his photograph
Run up in his lab, take off the mask Chaz and think fast
Don't laugh, bag the cash, grab the hash, don't forget his stash
Grab the tear gas, and place it in his face fast
The full blast

Then skate to the next state
Further upstate, I heard they got crazy weight
Bagged up by the gates, in crates like disco breaks
Yo look out for Jakes, give it all it takes
Let's burn the place before we motivate
Yo Blake, niggaz don't fink, rape his mate
If the bitch scream, for God's sake, grab the grey tape
It's by the plate, with the blow crushed up with the flakes
Killer snakes, four bodies found floatin in lakes
Drug related, paper talkin bout the kids who didn't make it
Hits without a trace, never seen the Big see Rae and Ghostface
Congratulations Chef, let's celebrate and sip an eighth

The rap scar is on rap chrome
Put it on seal it on, we're silicone
Spark it on your Talkathon
This rap phenomenon, to word is bond to the arms
Hit me on the hip and horns, rap chaperone
Scars tone, bar clones, war tones, raw tones
Blowin out the door, bones but
Your rap's fraudulent, float in these rap quarter inches
Reinforced with suspense, be on your rap sword defense
These microphone professional, sensational
Fully operational, I got NIGGAZ here to play with you
You know the steez you know my whole program
Brothers from the No-Lands, all we want is the G's
Guns and grams, livin fat like the Hoffa
Mafia, sippin eatin pastas
Layin in the house tellin the seeds about the sagas
Before we got Germanic and thoughts got sporadic
We grabbed golden tablets and quick guarded the Abbots
Slugs hit the belly put tones into the telly
Sucker tried to knock me out the box like skelly
I smoke the weed dreams I drop top two degrees
Honeydips spendin G's on nails and hair weave

Wind and rain and shine
That umbrella we employed it
By August she was mine

Waiting at the stop
Sometimes she'd shop
And she would show me what she'd bought 

Other people stared
As if we were both quite insane
Someday my name and hers
Are going to be the same 

That's the way the whole thing started
Silly but it's true
Thinking of our sweet romance
Beginning in a dew 

Came the sun
The ice was melting
No more sheltering now
Nice to think that that umbrella
Led me to avow

To hear the Angels sing

Sing, I do hear them singing

The gods from the stars came below
Completed the creation of man
The time of progress began

Superior knowledge familiar to us
Is regaining power from Sirius or Mars

Once, when the 12th planet crashed with the earth
A great flood drowned human wisdom and mirth

Only few survived the tragedy
All remains where dragged across the sea

Encoded in all fairy-tales and myths
The heritage of the ancient ones still lives

Tomorrow's dreams are memories from the past
The cosmic principles will everlast
But mystified fragments won't turn the page

Waters are deep where lost feelings sleep

And I could waltz across Texas with you
Well, I could waltz across Texas with you

You know I'm yours for just the taking

Golden Eagle String Band,"When I was a child my family would travel
Down to Western Kentucky where my parents were born
And there's a backwards old town that's often remembered
So many times that my memories are worn


And daddy won't you take me back to Muhlenberg County
Down by the Green River where Paradise lay
Well, I'm sorry my son, but you're too late in asking
Mister Peabody's coal train has hauled it away
Well, sometimes we'd travel right down the Green River
To the abandoned old prison down by Airdrie Hill
Where the air smelled like snakes and we'd shoot with our pistols
But empty pop bottles was all we would kill

Then the coal company came with the world's largest shovel
And they tortured the timber and stripped all the land
Well, they dug for their coal till the land was forsaken
Then they wrote it all down as the progress of man

When I die let my ashes float down the Green River
Let my soul roll on up to the Rochester dam
I'll be halfway to Heaven with Paradise waitin'
Just five miles away from wherever I am",Paradise,2007

Recorded on tape

Bought shame to the presidency

He had nothin' to lose
He was king of the Jews
Secured his place in history

Right through the needles eye
Want to be chilled, want to be thrilled
Press your luck right to the hilt
Hey boy, quit that stare
Get out of grandpa's rockin' chair
How about raisin' hell
Let's see if we outdo ourselves
One day you'll be tied and gagged
Your head upon the railroad track
The rail's hummin', there's a train a comin'
I'm sure your last thought's full of regret
Before the wheels roll across your neck
Why didn't I do this
How come I didn't do that
I could be out there, paintin' towns red
Sweat, maybe I'll wake up in bed
No boy, this is it
You should've used a bit more wit
Get out there and dig in deep
Stay wide awake when you're asleep
Who wants to compromise
When every second hour flies
Set the time on half past tilt
For making love right to the hilt
One day you'll be buried
Up to your elbows in the sand
And there's honey glowin'
Down your cheeks it's flowing
You'll find some time to reflect
Before the ants are crawling over your head
Why didn't I do this
How come I didn't do that
Is this a dream that's gone bad
Maybe I'll just wake up, wake up in bed

Violins bitter sweet
String quartet, pass around the hat
You broke my heart, don't you hurt my head
After Violet and me, saw the Paganini movie
We took a walk around the block to digest
The grand finale
A street-music man with shades and cane
Played the fiddler insane
For a case load of spare change
And the smiles of people passing
Between morning paper sins and waves of violins
It said they found him dead
His bow had made him bad friends
Cold blooded, warm hearted violin
Hooked on high speed energy
Cold blooded, warm hearted violin
Cats gut pumpin' adrenalin
Warm blooded, cold hearted violins
See 'm live tonight in the city
And the classic way, still on play
Violins bitter sweet
String quartet, pass around the hat
You broke my heart, don't you hurt my head

Cause the real thing is a mean thing
I guess nobody knew, the Barcelona Zoo
Has an albino monkey, that can trigger the mood
And provoke monkey motions
So when the shit flies high
Through the Barcelona sky
The crowd stands by, a cheering
Cold blooded, warm hearted violin
Hooked on high speed energy
Cold blooded, warm hearted violin
Cats gut pumpin' adrenalin
Warm blooded, cold hearted violins

It's disappointment time again, I've been up here before
The wind balloons my jacket, seabirds collide below
A pier stands on a hundred stilts, some stranded UFO
I've stopped the car, in a dead end street
Rear view mirror, nothing but empty seats
I could brace myself, smash through the concrete
Find what's behind that wall of insecurity
From gin and jags, to squalor and scab
Selena, what a drag
Once we were, back to back
Almost there, but white was black
Why me, designed to compete
Always, flirtin' with defeat
Why me, I knew it when we met
Hell, what else could you expect
Why me, hungry for affection
It ends, with chaos and rejection
Through the wall and over the cliff
I made the decision, you took quite a risk
Selena says, as she strokes my head
With luck like yours, you should be dead
Forget the past and melt my silver spoon
Selena, not a minute too soon
Broke the chains of negativity
At last I score a victory
Why me, no need to compete
Nowadays, I think at defeat
She's me, I felt it when me met
That feel, cancels all regret
Me, the center of attraction
The end, adds to your confusion

Used to be a young gun
Out on the hard streets
Getting high on crystal
Drinking scotch and smoking weed
Daddy's wish used to be nothing less than my command
Took a switch to my back nailed me to a cross both hands
Mama couldn't give me
The thing a young boy needs
Instead of mama suffering
She was smart enough to leave
Spend my life fighting trying to stay free
From trials and tribulations and the state penitentiary
Hustled pool really looking cool
Just making both ends meet
Until that day I saw you walking
Down Blue Angel street
The sweetest lies are lily white coming from your lips
You brush away all my pain with a lazy finger tip hm
It moves my heart just watching
The way you walk so smooth
You save me from an evil fate
You steal away my blues
Lyin' here in your arms
I don't need more proof
Lyin' here safe and warm
It's just the naked truth
This man loves you
This man loves you
This man loves you
This man loves you
That's the naked truth
It's the naked truth

There was nothing I could do
Life treatin' me much harder
Than a mean old corkscrew

You walk into the room - with your pencil in your hand
You see somebody naked and you say: Who's that man
You try so hard but, you don't understand
Just what you'll say when you get home
Because somethin' is happenin' here
But you don't know what it is -
Do you - Mister Jones?
You raise your head - and you ask. Is this where it is?
And somebody points to you and says it's his
And somebody else says Well what is
And you say Oh my God - am I here all alone?
You hand in your ticket - And you go watch the geek
Who immediately walks up to you -
When he hears you speak - and says -
Now does it feel to be such a freak
And you say

Golden Earring,"From the Album:
* Lovesweat

Blue for the blue - I feel when I'm feelin' down
On the ground - feelin' down that could be most anyday
Green for the eyes - take a look around
When the sun goes down - and the sun goes down
In the strangest way -
Red for the light - gotta stop this thing
Find a song to sing that is everything
That I meant to say - meant to say -
Pray for the mice that are blind like the world
Never see the good that is done to the bad
It's too late to see
Two of us make it easier, to read the signs
Memorize the lines - you play with me
One for the road - I'll be on my way
Come another day - when the things we say
Find a way to be - way to be -
Solo:
Autumn calls for a change of year
Bringin' winter near us - greens are brown
And disquise a sign -
Wintertime is a razorblade - that the devil made
It's a price we pay for the summertime
Springdays come it's hard to know
Where the rain comes from - where the children go -
It's a nursery rhyme - nursery rhyme

Golden Earring,"Darkness, darkness, be my pillow
Take my head and let me sleep
In the coolness of your shadow
In the silence of your deep

Darkness, darkness, hide my yearning
For the things I cannot see
Keep my mind from constant turning
Towards the things I cannot be

Ah yes, the things I cannot see
Darkness, darkness, long and lonesome
Is the day that brings me here
I have felt the edge of sadness
I have known the depth of fear

Darkness, darkness, be my blanket
Cover me with the endless night
Take away the pain of knowing
Fill the emptiness of fright
Ah yes, the emptiness of fright

I took out every pretty girl in town.
They danced with me, and while I held them,
All I did was to talk about you.
Hear your name and I'd start to cry
There is just no getting over you.
No girl who is in my little red book,
Just ever could replace your love,
And each girl in my little red book
Knows you're the one I'm thinking of.
Won't you please come back to me?

Never ending, unrelenting
Heartbreak searing, always fearing
Never clearing, persevering

Past shipwrecked daughters
Of wicked waters
Uninspired, drenched and tired
Sail on, sail on sailor
Always needing, even bleeding
Never feeding, all my feelings
Damn the thunder, must I blunder
There's no wonder, all I'm under

Shining so pretty like a centerfold

Whenever I wanted she was ready to roll
She’d never tire, felt like Jimmy Dean

Yea, look out preacher!

Well, about that time the limb broke off
And the preacher came tumblin' down
Had a straight razor out of his pocket 
By the time he lit on the ground
He landed on his feet right in front a that bear
And Lord, what an awful fight 
The preacher and the bear and the razor and the hair
Flyin' from left to right

Well first they was up and then they was down
The preacher and the bear runnin' round an' round
The bear he roared, and the the preacher he groaned
He was havin' a tough time holdin' his own!
He said, ""Lord if I get out a here alive
To the good book I'll abide
No more huntin' on the Sabbath day
Come Sunday I'm headin' to the church to pray""

Up to the heavens the preacher glanced 
He said, ""Lord won't you give me just one more chance""
So the preacher got away, he looked around
Seen a tree where he'd be safe and sound
Jumped on a limb, turned about
Looked to the sky and began to shout

""Hey lord, you delivered Daniel from the bottom of the lion's den
You delivered Jonah from the belly of the whale and then
The Hebrew children from the fiery furnace

Now I'm walkin', talkin' to myself

Love, oh love, oh careless love
Trusted you now, it's too late
You've made me throw my old friend down
That's why I sing this song of hate

Night and day, I weep and moan
You brought the wrong man into this life of mine
For my sins, till judgment I'll atone",Careless Love,2001
Golden Gate Quartet,"Frankie and Johnny were sweethearts,
Boy, how they could love!
Swore to be true to each other,
True as the stars above!
'Cause he was her man,
But he done her wrong!

One night Frankie happened to pass by the hotel;
Just casually glanced into a window so high,
And who did she see but her lovin' man
Lovin' up old Nellie Bligh!
She caught her man
Doin' her wrong!

Well, she went round the corner to her favourite pawn shop;
This time she didn't go there for fun!
'Cause when she left, underneath her long red kimono,
She was totin' a forty-four gun!
She was gunnin' for her man
Who was doin' her wrong!

Then back Frankie dashed to that hotel,
Started yankin' the bell!
She said, ""Stand back, you madam and floozies,
Or I'll blow each and every one of you straight to hell!
I want my man
Who's done me wrong!"".

Johnnie, in panic, mounted the staircase,
Screamin', ""Oh Frankie, don't shoot!""
Three times she pulled a trigger on a forty-four gun,
The gun went, ""Root-toot-toot!"".
She nailed her man
Who'd done her wrong!

So they put her away in a dungeon,
Way up in a dark dingy cell
In the south east corner of a jail,
Where the wind seemed to blow straight from hell!
For killin' her man
Who done her wrong!

But the day Frankie mounted the scaffold,
She was just as calm as any gal could be!
And raising her eyes to heaven she cried,
""Lord, I'm comin' to thee!
I'm sorry I killed my man
Who done me wrong!"".",Frankie and Johnny,2001

Wishing is good time wasted,
Still it's a habit they say;
Wishing for sweet's I've tasted,
That's all I do all day.
Maybe there's nothing in wishing,
But, speaking of wishing I'll say:

Nothing could be finer
Than to be in Carolina

No one could be sweeter
Than my sweetie when I meet her
In the morning.

When the morning glories
Twine around the door
Whispering pretty stories
I long to hear once more
Strolling with my girlie
Where the dew is pearly early
In the morning.

Butterflies all flutter up
And kiss each little buttercup
At dawning.
If I had Alladin's lamp
For only a day
I'd make a wish
And here's what I'd say

Nothing could be finer
Than to be in Carolina
In the morning.

Dreaming was meant for night time
I live in dreams all the day; 
I know it's not the right time,
But still I dream away
What could be sweeter than dreaming,
Just dreazming and drift away. 

Nothing could be finer
Than to be in Carolina

Steals across the meadows of my heart

The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms

Of paradise, where roses grew

Don't be fooled thinking this is the last you'll find""

A gold snake slid from the sky
And swallowed him up
He disappeared inside

The man was drunk from a flask half full of rum
I shook my head
When he offered me some
Que sera, he said and took another swig

Its nights like these, they will fall out of the sky

All washed up on the shore

Gun sling my dreams I rain supreme
And fiend for the next challenge, knocking you off balance

Starving to death and dying of thirst (alive!)
Here in the flesh, elope with the profoc-

Three'd be hat trick
Gave him more shots than the pediatrics
Came to his house and shot his left hand out
Left him with more scars than Mr. Def Jam South

To handle more cigars than a Cuban cargo
Makin money from everything I spoke in this
Wrapped by more ice than a broken wrist
Got ability to make missy a little tipsy
I'm more P.I.M.P than Mississippi (git it? Uh!)

I know you like to show off you're bust in gowns
'cause you go around jugglin guys nuts around
And we don't gotta wait till you're ass confesses
'cause you go around showing off you're ass in dresses
You watchin porn sittin there at you're macintosh
With you're hand in you're ass like you're jackin off
And you try goin harder than star wars Anakin
'cause you practice at you're house with a anus manikin

got a belt full of steel you can call me santa
You better keep your eyes peeled like a fuckin banana
And don't try to shoot me like some dumb retards
'cause I miss bullets like I'm sendin them e-cards 
Always equipped with the vest so don't aim for the bell-ay
'cause I dodge bullets like I play for LA
And I'm invisible 'cause you can't even see me son
But you're soft as shit I could shoot you with a bb gun
They call me stretch where I'm from 'cause I'm extended out
Find your ass in my house and I'll send it out
I got a custom made gun so the cops link my shot
So far.. how many mother fuckers do you think I got?

You said if we hit somebody we're suppose to say sorry
But you never say sorry daddy you yell now
Why did you tell that man that mommy just fell down
Mommy didn't fall down daddy's lying
Mommy why are you always sad and always crying?
Daddy why are you always mad you always fighting?
Why do you always say I'm bad even when I'm trying?
No I don't want to go to my room
I don't want to go to bed now I want to be with you
I don't want to daddy it's to early
I didn't mean it daddy I'm sorry I'm sorry
I promise I'll never say that again
I'm sorry daddy please don't hit me again

What up pops I ain't got to tell you my heart is as hard as a rock
Things have changed since I was the age six
Yet some situations stay the same
Like the way I conceal my pain
Growing up I'd swear my name was every profane thing a man could say
I used to make excuses like you weren't the one that hit her
It was just the liquor in ya
My dad the perfect example of hatred and why am I so bitter?
Ya told me real men don't cry that was a lie
You don't realize what goes on inside of my mind
As time passed my heart ran cold my emotions froze
Lost track of the bruises and the broken bones
Just once wanted to hear that you loved me
Wrap your arms around me and hug me yeah right
Remember the first time I couldnt feel the pain
It was when grandma came and took me to church
Where God relieved the hurt and he knows it took work
But I forgave you he could save you but the question is
Will you let him in it would be such a blessing
To see you as a changed man and holdin my mother's hand

Me and my dunn's thoughts divide like earth and the rain
I'm severed like Kevin Spacey and depth to the game
We the same in every aspect except for the chain
Connect 41-18 the bridge bang
I give the kidney, just so the lord will forgive me
And bring back mami and mambo, mano a mano
We poly over Chardonnay bottles, 
Opposite like Felix and Oscar
Sign to the street like Carlos 
We sway deeper than the shit through the speaker
I smoke grade A reefer
Up north sport away for the cesaer
Used to smuggle through the mess hall, 
Blow a stiff circle in the yard
Be home now, stuck in our zone now
Can't take it from us, we run wit the corner
Nigga we stay dirty, you know, straight slum performers
A judge, then I'll ride for you, 
Assist a slug then I'll die for you

Trying to make the answer's more a maybe
And I'm so confused, about what to do
Sometimes I want to throw it all away

Looking older all the time,
Feeling younger in my mind
So here I am, doing everything I can
Holding on to what I have
Pretending I'm a superman
I'm trying to sleep,
I lost count of sheep,
My mind is racing faster every minute
What could I do more,
Yeah, I'm really not sure
I don't want to run in circles but I can't quit
And I'm so confused
I've got a lot to do
Sometimes I want to throw it all away
Controlling everything inside
Feeling weak I don't feel right
Telling me I have to change
Telling me to act my age
But if all that I can do
Is to sit and watch time go
Then I'll have to say goodbye
And I'll be sure to watch time fly, to watch it fly-hy-hy

And I'm feeling guilty
Just talk to me
Please, talk to me

I hardly know you
Is it too late to even try?
I want to know you

Once in a while you'd fuck with me

You would make the metal sign

I know I want to but it gets
Harder every time

To give up everything 
I'd give it all to you
To relieve half this pain

Yeah it's been hard 

I sit there at the bar
I wonder what I've done

And the beer tastes just like piss

Buy a bag of balloons with the money weÂ´ve got
Set them free at the break of dawn
Till one by one they were gone
Back at base, sparks in the software
Flash the message â??somethings out thereâ??
Floating in the summer sky
Ninety nine red balloons go by

Floating in the summer sky
Panic bells, its red alert
ThereÂ´s something here from somewhere else
The war machine springs to life
Opens up one eager eye
And focusing it on the sky
The ninety nine red balloons go by

Ninety nine decisions treat
Ninety nine ministers meet
To worry, worry, super scurry
Call the troops out in a hurry
This is what we've waited for
This is it boys, this is war
The President is on the line
As ninety nine red balloons go by

Ninety nine knights of the air
Ride super high-tech jet fighters
Everyone's a super hero
Everyone's a Captain Kirk
With orders to identify
To clarify and classify
Scrambling the summer sky
Ninety nine red balloons go by

As ninety nine red balloons go by

Ninety nine dreams I have had
In every one a red balloon
It's all over and I'm standing pretty
In this dust that was a city
If could find a souvenir
Just the prove the world was here
And here is a red balloon

buy a bag of balloons with the money we've got

Panic bells, it's red alert
There's something here from somewhere else
The war machine springs to life
Opens up one eager eye
Focusing it on the sky

To worry, worry, super-scurry
Call the troops out in a hurry

ride super-high-tech jet fighters

Everyone's a Captain Kirk

To clarify and classify

Lets get this shit peculating son you know
Thugged Out entertainment coming at your motherfucking neighborhood
Know what I'm saying, like a theater near you
Troy Outlaw, Goldfingaz
Capone-N-Noreaga 2000 CNN you know how we doing
Thugged out entertainment taking over the motherfucking world
for the new millennium, know what I'm saying? 
Ya niggas can't fuck with this
Ya niggas can't stop this, ya niggas can't touch this
Ya niggas had better ??

[Capone]
Me and my dunn's thoughts divide like earth and the rain
I'm severed like Kevin Spacey and depth to the game
We the same in every aspect except for the chain
Connect 41-18 the bridge bang
I give the kidney, just so the lord will forgive me
And bring back mami and mambo, mano a mano
We poly over Chardonnay bottles, 
Opposite like Felix and Oscar
Sign to the street like Carlos 
We sway deeper than the shit through the speaker
I smoke grade A reefer
Up north sport away for the cesaer
Used to smuggle through the mess hall, 
Blow a stiff circle in the yard
Be home now, stuck in our zone now
Can't take it from us, we run wit the corner
Nigga we stay dirty, you know, straight slum performers
A judge, then I'll ride for you, 
Assist a slug then I'll die for you
I'm loyal, what nigga

[Chorus]
[Troy Outlaw]
I bust a cap for my brother till death do us part
And ?for my brother?? I'll show you love from the heart

You and I we can die together, yo shit don't change
We'll always be thugs forever

From the start playa haters tried to disconnect us
We too tight for that, we getting more cheddar

But me and you we can die together
But me and you we can die together

Yo from harlon valley to greenhaven 
We had these niggas that's Wes Craven
Never good never behavin'
Victor Santiago, and ?Kaya M Holly?
You know how we do, 
Catch a body then we go party
We used to be in billyway, church and jail 
 
Me and capone smoke weed till I burnt my nail 
I used to cut niggas faces 
Smoke weed out of bible papers 
The Knicks and the Lakers
See me with a Northface, facing the north
Drinking Schmirnoff and taking niggas face right off
N.O.R., and shit ain't really change that much 
Except I smoke a Philly can't fuck wit her guts
I eat aunties food, the best in new york 
Boneless chicken, and she don't cook no pork
I got some Chardonnay, nigga go and pop the cork
Me and Capone made up, everytime we fought

[chorus]
[Goldfingaz]
From out the dark into the lights on the streets
Slugs pop when slugs meet 
Its death from the birth of the streets
Yo outlaw, hit me 1-6-0-9
Cock back and bust nines, this bitch nigga plotting on mom
My fam too, 'cause god niggas body your crew
Bitches will never come between the life of two
And ain't nothin gonna change but my age
My attitude is deep, I get it from my peoples in graves

[Troy Outlaw]
Yo me and you, been together like tango and ??
Like Capone-N-Noreaga like the weed and hash
We stick together like coke, like we still sell drugs 
Bad seeds from the ghetto but we still get love
We just trying to make it, while other niggas fake it
We blow your cool like we chill now its time to take it 
Like you never had it, you don't deserve it 
Fake niggas getting jealous 
But these hoes be giving cervix

Straight like that, official thug niggas
Real niggas, know what I'm saying? 
Real niggas selling that crack
Busting their cap, know what i'm saying?
Real niggas don't cry

Fuck you, fuck your crew, fuck your girl too

To only pass the time
No more coloring books,
No Christmas bells to chime
But thinking young and growing older is no sin
And I can play the game of life to win

When I wasn't afraid to reach out to a friend
And now I think I've got
A lot more than a skipping rope to lift

Now there's more to do
Than watch my sailboat glide
Then everyday can be my magic carpet ride
And I can play hide and seek with my fears,
And live my life instead of counting my years

Let everyone debate the true reality,
I'd rather see the world the way it used to be
A little bit of freedom, all we're left

You're not ready for this. 
Uh-huh. You see, my name is KRS-One G
And um, see, when I be coming through, for the U.K.-crew
Me and Goldie sssh, you know how we do
Only the true hip-hop-heads know what time it is with this
Now, if you're with me.

Ill lead through and dominate this microphone I speak through
I'm writing for the people, bite it if you need to
I can see through and see that, you saw an MC and tried to be that
That MC you saw was me can you believe that? And obey that?

True lyrics will always subvice and meaning rhymes equal actual life
Its the true essence in ebony, trace your record-sales G
Somethings are pure luck, other things are meant to be
I bet they'll mention me, in the next century:

KRS-One, innovator in early rap-poetry
Simultaneously you will be forgotten
While in the year 2000 Criminal Minded will still be rocking
You waste your time battling me I got mine happening, see?

You should have thought G, a little bit sooner
Instead of battling me you need your plan your long heavity
Before you die broke like Sammy Davis junior
The solar, followed by the looter, followed by the solar

Followed by McDonalds and Coca-Cola
The point is whatever the outcome of the battle
The day goes on with more french fries and soda
One, two and you don't quit, Goldie has got to be the real sure shit
One, two and you don't quit, KRS-One and yes we do it like this

Buckle up your seatbelt we about to get busy
Lyrics get thrown like a frisbee, who is he?
The K, you gets dizzy all for the roots like Kizzy
And Kunta-Kinte in your city

Ask for Sensei not million more like teacher
Now you're familiar let me fill ya
Its like a jungle sometimes, it makes me rhyme
As were climbing up the speed, were finding what we need in the jungle

MC's stumble over their words and mumble over their verbs
Suddenly it occured: KRS-One, word!

KRS-One, come back in digital, digital, digital, digital -2x
I gotta get buckwild, I gotta get buckwild
I gotta get buckwild, coming through with that freestyle -2x

You can run with this, on the junglelist
Only KRS-One can do it like this
Forever, and ever a decade embedder
Whatever, how ever, rough to the leather

Let me shedder flame as I go offstage and blow up game
In the jungle I spot the L. like U.N.C.L.E. when I cast don't fumble
Kris and Goldie drum n bass only no one can hold me
U.K. drum n bass all in your face

Got to represent U.K. up in this place

Goldie,"Don't erase what I did, don't erease the beginning!

You're not ready for this. 
Uh-huh. You see, my name is KRS-One G
And um, see, when I be coming through, for the U.K.-crew
Me and Goldie sssh, you know how we do
Only the true hip-hop-heads know what time it is with this
Now, if you're with me.

Ill lead through and dominate this microphone I speak through
I'm writing for the people, bite it if you need to
I can see through and see that, you saw an MC and tried to be that
That MC you saw was me can you believe that? And obey that?

True lyrics will always subvice and meaning rhymes equal actual life
Its the true essence in ebony, trace your record-sales G
Somethings are pure luck, other things are meant to be
I bet they'll mention me, in the next century:

KRS-One, innovator in early rap-poetry
Simultaneously you will be forgotten
While in the year 2000 Criminal Minded will still be rocking
You waste your time battling me I got mine happening, see?

You should have thought G, a little bit sooner
Instead of battling me you need your plan your long heavity
Before you die broke like Sammy Davis junior
The solar, followed by the looter, followed by the solar

Followed by McDonalds and Coca-Cola
The point is whatever the outcome of the battle
The day goes on with more french fries and soda
One, two and you don't quit, Goldie has got to be the real sure shit
One, two and you don't quit, KRS-One and yes we do it like this

Buckle up your seatbelt we about to get busy
Lyrics get thrown like a frisbee, who is he?
The K, you gets dizzy all for the roots like Kizzy
And Kunta-Kinte in your city

Ask for Sensei not million more like teacher
Now you're familiar let me fill ya
Its like a jungle sometimes, it makes me rhyme
As were climbing up the speed, were finding what we need in the jungle

MC's stumble over their words and mumble over their verbs
Suddenly it occured: KRS-One, word!

KRS-One, come back in digital, digital, digital, digital -2x
I gotta get buckwild, I gotta get buckwild
I gotta get buckwild, coming through with that freestyle -2x

You can run with this, on the junglelist
Only KRS-One can do it like this
Forever, and ever a decade embedder
Whatever, how ever, rough to the leather

Let me shedder flame as I go offstage and blow up game
In the jungle I spot the L. like U.N.C.L.E. when I cast don't fumble
Kris and Goldie drum n bass only no one can hold me
U.K. drum n bass all in your face

Got to represent U.K. up in this place
Representing like the internet
All the way from New York City down to your motherfucking set

Two nickels and the other's a dime
You wouldn't want to, keep a hood on her
When I'm dropping that motherfucking wood on her
Cause I perform, a G like Warren
A nigga getting paid off shooting porn
They call me the black folks President
Snoop Heffner mixed with a little bit of Doggy Flint
Banging this parliament, come get a bar with this

Quit playing with the hoe, and let me borrow the bitch

I'm trying to work it fast, but I know you like it slow
You know I got to bust a nut and hurry up and go
You got something that I want right now
Hurry up and let me put the black spot on the cow
Make the pussy ball up like salt to a snail
And when I kill it big daddy, I want you to tell
Cause I don't give a damn when it come to freaking hoes
Call up forty hoes, and have a rolly peep show
And when you give me something, you gone want something back
This dick to your mouth, little mama like that
Fish cost too much, so I feed her sardines
Man I'm the motherfucking MVP of the team
Cold game how a nigga steady spitting this shit

Hey, what's up I came to pimp
Fur hats and fur clothes, and a razor tim
Bitch, I got it made
Just pick one of my hoes, and I got it leid
You never heard as many bitches so fast and frequent
Can I get the ends, bitch delinquents
Run my bath water, cook my meals
And shut the fuck up, when I book the deals
And iron my draws, give me cuffs and creases

When we fuck around it ain't nothing consensual
You know I funk so hard, you gonna need your parent's credentials
Now I'm in the street, cause I lost my sheet
But now I know where to find it

Now how cool is called when you're trying to compete
Standing next to me son, you better take a seat
Can't none of you customers funk like me
You better check with Snoop Doggy
Why oh why do I think like that
If I am with the dog then you must be a cat
Now tally ho and away we go, see you next week with a brand new show
I want the funk I want that OG
There's a party going on in my head
While I think about the blood that we shed
Them party, oh get up playa play
There's a party going on up in here

Back in the day, of the keeper and the keeper
Gettin' high with your friends and smokin' the reefer
And pound fro pound we were the baddest in town
You just had to get up for the endo

For once I'm my life
It's gonna feel real good,
Gonna make a difference
Gonna make it right

As I, turn up the collar on
My favorite winter coat
This wind is blowing my mind
I see the kids in the streets,
With not enough to eat
Who am I to be blind?
Pretending not to see their needs

A summer disregard,a broken bottle top
And a one man soul
They follow each other on the wind ya' know
'Cause they got nowhere to go

Guns don't kill people rappers do,
Ask any politican and they'll tell you its true,
Its a fact music makes you violent,
Like Michael Jackson telling little Timmy to be silent, 
You don't believe me? here's my hype,
Offer me the record and i'll show you the type, 
Of criminal this rap shit is breedin, 
Its a fact that MC Hammer left me bleedin, 
Vanilla Ice made my mother say 'Fuck', 
If I stuck with UB40 then I woulda been in luck,
But I didn't I got it wrong, 
Cypress fucking hill to me to make a fucking bong,
So I started, I bought another tape, 
That bad boy vibe made my cock and balls ache,
So remember kids from the head double tap,
Guns don't kill people its just rap!

[Chorus]
Guns don't kill people rappers do
So of the police
Woo woo woo

Guns don't kill people rappers do,
I seen it in a documentary on BBC2,
Shot to death outside Hyper Value, 
Guns blazin like Michael Cain in Zulu,
Guns with sadistic are sometimes misleading,
The type of criminal that rap is breedin,
Shot in the chest? No wonder you stopped breathin,
2 for the base over, are you receivin?
Remember rap tracks in '87
Scott the Rock's up ni Hip-Hop heaven,
Biggie and Tupac R.I.P,
Even Jam Master Jays in the cemetary.

[chorus]
Guns don't kill people rappers do,
I'm a fucking rapper and I might kill you,
As a rapper I'm teachin you a lesson,
AK47 to Smith-and-Weston
Just say no, just like Zappo
Bullet proof vest, to guns and ammo,
Hip-hop gangster trippin,
Even Eminems into pistol whippin,
Its like cluedo murder one,
P-Diddy, J'lo in a nightclub with a gun,
Heard snoop dog now wants to bust a cap, 
Guns don't kill people its just rap

One, Two yo face my shoe,
My name is Mike Balls and I'm comin through,
Gun crimes, stabbin, and burglarisation,
Its on a rise all across the nation,
The safety's off and the pistol is aimed,
Yardies and the Mafia always get blamed,
Politicians are shamed, and they haven't got a clue,
Rap is more deadly than fucking Kung-Fu

[Chorus]
Guns don't kill people rappers do,
From Bristol Zoo to B&Q,
I want to rap, I want to rhyme
Heard it in a song now I'm into gun crime,
Its a sign of the times like Prince changin his name,
Gotta have a shooter to be in the rap game,
Like Michael Ryan about to snap, 
Guns don't kill people its just rap!

I need to shift this draw quick as fuck
Flip the cash and take my cut 
It's really powerful, it's so strong 
But I'm selling it fast and it's nearly all gone 

I'll sell you the 9-bar or just the ounce 
I'll sell you little bits or large amounts 
Adam Hussain, remember me? 
Selling draw from my Capri 

Want some draw? With me you'll score 
Cos I grows this shit out o' my nan's back door 
Bongs big as, blow buckets, 
I sell like ounces to schoolkids but I don't care, fuck it 

Get it on tick, but make it quick 
I just got a load of wicked Thai stick 
Party's going down, I'll bring the brown 
Tonight it's going off in Newport town

So if you want some let me know, cos I really gotta go 
I got 21 ounces of blow, blow, blow

I've got a stack of weed like a bale of Hay 
I drive my Capri like Colin Macrae 
And I gotta drop some weed off in Alway 

I've got really good scales and my deals and my deals are proper 
The prices is wicked too just like Happy Shopper 
I sells the best skunk you tell by the smell 
I'll also sell you fags and Rizlas as well 

Oi, clart! Don't fuckin' start 
Or I'll whip you with my chain and it'll fuckin' smart 
Weed's green, like a frog

Cos the boot's rammed with Mary Jane 
That's right, it's Benny Blanco 
Selling the speed and the blow 

Out of my car, cos that's how it's done 
Pigs bust me twice and it got me on the run 
Adam Hussain, I'm fuckin' GLC, 
Cos if you wanted THC come see me 

There's a new dance going on, 
In Newport, it's called the funky bong 
You wiggle your hips and start to show off 
Breathe in and out and then you cough 

You can only do it when you're smoking a cone 
You can do it with your mates or all alone 
Right to the left, left to the right 
GLC and the funky bong, alright?

I got 21 ounces of blow 
I got 21 ounces of blow 
So if you want some let me know, cos I really gotta go 
I got 21 ounces of blow, blow, blow 

Raw speed, whatever you need 
Cos I've always got a big bag of weed 
My shit ain't bunk, I sell skunk 
Out of my low-ride Capri's trunk 

Wanna gurn? You better learn 
Your missus'll get free pills burping my worm 
She's on all fours, wouldn't touch her with yours 
Cos she looks like the wookie outta fuckin' Star Wars 

I got 21 ounces of blow 
I got 21 ounces of blow 
So if you want some let me know, cos I really gotta go 
I got 21 ounces of blow, blow, blow

Oh, maggot, he's a modern day fagan
Turfin' out your pockets like a Christian burns a pagan
Drippin' with charm, style and panache
He'll leave you sore like a venereal rash

They tried to catch him, he says, time to dash
He always leaves a party with a wallet full of cash
He's a bastard but he's always lookin' flash
With his shoes like Dick Turpin across his waist he wears a sash

Sportin' top hat with a pocket watch too
With the tallest member of the Goldie lookin' crew
Watch out, if he's there when you're pissed
He learnt his science from the man, Oliver Twist

Of his crimes, we tried to compile a list
Sellin' sexy DVD's of a Willy being kissed
Stealin' pensions on the old and infirm

Made a fortune sellin' doctors fake sperm
Like Charles Dickens there's a lesson to be learned
Beware, the maggot 'cause the worm has turned

All of the youth shall witness the day that Babylon shall fall

Just like Jack, the Ripper he'll do you up a kipper
He's like a highway man holdin' up a Newport nipper
He's smarter than Sherlock Holmes or I TV's Taggart
I'm dapper refined and they call me the maggot

Turn your back and your pocket he will pick
His eyes and talons are fukin' deadly equipped
Like a chameleon, I'm the master thief
Usin' a disguise dressed like Penelope Keith

You gotta smoke a reefer or two
You gotta smoke a reefer or two

To takin' belongings in my ultimate goal
I'll take your China and your silver and your soul
By darkness and night I shimmy up the drain-pipe

The maggot, the maggot, that's who I am
Don't ever trust me, always doin' a scam
I punched a woman and stole the baby and a pram
I even sliced my penis up and sold it as ham

Gold chains and watches, maggot's got plenty
He pinched them from ladies and upset the gentry
Like Sherlock Holmes bummin' Watson, it's elementary
He's the modern day menace of the nineteenth century

A gentleman thief, a scholar and a rogue
Doing the locomotion like Kylie Minogue
He's got the strength of ten like a maniac
And I'm also identified as Spring-heeled Jack

Here he comes, watch out, son, he'll rip you off
Here he comes, he's a money grabbin' bastard from Newport

Free Dick Turpin and the ring stinger
Big up to Dipper Nan Merthyr Connection

Big up to Pontllanfraith crew also the west end crew Abercarn

In 1983, a team of crack draw enthusiasts created a master plan.
A design for a way of livin' so revolutionary, so groundbreaking,
That its very concept posed a threat to the fabric of society.

A threat even greater than that of having a stiffy whilst standing
In the middle of a Glyn Williams' coach full of nuns.

The implications of this radical movements' political manifesto
Posed a threat to the UK authorities who in turn drove its founder
Members under ground.

Chaos reveal, the Manifesto",The Manifesto,2005
Goldie Lookin Chain,"Hey, the first time that I met my mate
Was in the roller rink where I went to skate
It was early in the decade around '83
Back then Maskell's was the place to be

Pay two quid for your entry fee
I glide into the arena, ecstasy
When you were seven you didn't realize
Most of the adults were stoned out of their eyes

Some jacked up on the seats around the edge
Others were so fucked that they turned into veg
I didn't care 'cause I made my pledge
Rollskating at Maskell's got respect

I used to listen to Public Enemy
Erik be and Rakim and BVSMP
But before that in 1983
I'd go break dancing after my tea

Down the Youth Club, eating the fruit pastels
Saturday morning I'd go down to Maskell's
It was my favorite place to go
Dancing all day at the Roller Disco

N-n-nineteen eighty three

When Maskells is over it's out on your bike
Doing bunny hops and wheelies if you like
Nicking from the shop and comparing your Nike
Dropping bricks onto trains was a delight

Then I'd find a weak kid and have a fight
Use your pocket money to buy a head band for the night
From Fussels, Newport's health-sports store
This is the stuff I used to do before

Draw Paul Hardcastle, n-n-nineteen
Was always played on the roller disco scene
I would listen to the music 'til I went deaf
Skating around backwards to Axel F

Even back then I was still wearing gold
They had an ice rink upstairs so I was told
It was ecstasy going round a pillar
Doing a special dance to Michael Jackson's 'Thriller'

why-why-you fukin' knows it
N-n-nineteen eighty three
How was the year son?
N-n-nineteen eighty three

Oh, eating cola cubes and watching Grange Hill
Riding my chopper to the Chip shop in Pill
I didn't know words like Cunny or Vag
Getting my two hundred meters swimming badge

Back then you were seven, I was eight
I only just started to masturbate
When I was in school the days went slow
'cause I was dreaming of a fuckin' roller disco
F-f-fucking alright
S-s-say first fuck

I didn't smoke, I didn't drink booze
I collected 'Star Wars' stickers and bubble gum tattoos
Stuck 'em on my face 'cause it made me feel hard
Then popped into the shop to buy some football cards

Finished the album, Panini '83
Get back home in time for the A-Team and tea
Then watch Bullseye and Saint and Greavsie
Go to bed, 'til tomorrow, see?

I watch the A-Team and Airwolf too
Before I found drugs and started sniffing glue
Riding round the lane on my Grifter or my Chopper
Even back then I was a hip hopper

I tries to do it proper but kept comin' up a cropper
I needs some hype I think I'll ram raid happy shopper
Haven't got a car so I use a space hopper
Bouncing to the window, cut my head, show stopper
I want a hundred fans, 200 teeny boppers
I want police protection from 87 coppers
I wanna go gold even better platinum
If you wanna be a star you gotta kill yourself, man

It might be messy but it's money for free

Suicide is painless or so it has been said
I could've killed myself but I'd be better off dead
So I took a deep breath, put a gun against my head
Pulled the trigger, click, should've been eating lead
But I wasn't, I was naked in john frost square
Mothers with pushchairs stopped and stared
For this situation I was quite unprepared
Tried suicide to be famous but nobody cared

We want people to sing all our songs
And the nuns at saint Joseph's rappin' on smokin' bongs
We wanna be remembered when we're six feet under

Double platinum means you gotta be pushin' up daisies
Dad's army's all dead, every last one
But the cents are still going on BBC1

How can I be a pop star when I can't buy a gun?

I know, I'll hang myself with my scarf
Tied to the stairs, dangling by my neck

He cut me down and started to laugh
'if you're dead next week gimme your autograph'
You know I thanked him, returned to my room

To the station, with a petrol can
Five pound please, I say to the man
All set up and ready to burn

Goldie Lookin Chain,"Burned a new hole in my tracksuit today,
Smoking Soap Bar without an ashtray,
Red-hot nylon dripping on my skin,
I ripped the fucker off, and threw it in the bin,
Soap Bar?s cheap, and so?s my clothes,
they've got to be cause of all the fucking holes,
It tastes like shit and it makes you cough,
And it?s the fucking rubber in it that gets you off.

Yeah, I smoke Soap Bar with lots of bits of plastic,
I leaves mine in it cause it tastes fantastic,
Skunk costs too much, I can't see the appeal,
Of smoking Port Rocky, Soap Bar or Gold Seal,
Smoke Rocky in a bong, bucket or hot-knives,
Bake it in a cake for your Mam as a surprise,
I smokes Green, and it?s gone in an instant,
But Soap Bar lasts, cause it?s fucking consistent.

Smoking on up, Soap Bar in the sky,
I?ll smoke Soap Bar ?till I fucking die,
Before I die and they lay me to rest,
I will always smoke Soap Bar, that's the best.

Last night I went out driving in my car,
I sparked up a fat spliff of fucking Soap Bar,
A Blim-burn burned right down to my dick,
And while I was distracted, I fucking crashed into a 
Brick wall, the car was fucking battered,
The bonnet flipped up and the windscreen shattered,
you're better off smoking The Green instead,
Cause it don't Blim-Burn and it?s better for your head.

Soap Bar! Sitting in a deep sweat,
Thinking! I've got to get some Rocky for the,
Weekend! The sight of Draw excites me,
Stick it in a bong, light it up and chug a fucking,
Whitey! Burning holes in my tracky,
This shit always happens when I'm smoking fucking Rocky,
you've heard it on the news; you've seen it on the telly,
Add up for moving Soap Bar down fucking Liz Werry
?I do it like a little cause light the fucking thing as always?
I used to smoke Skunky but it was far too smelly, man! 

Smoking on up, Soap Bar in the sky,
I?ll smoke Soap Bar ?till I fucking die,
Before I die and they lay me to rest,
I will always smoke Soap Bar, that's the best.

Most Soap Bar comes from fucking Holland,
They make it out of oil, and tires and pollen,
Diesel, Miramar, Flat-Press too;
These are types of Soap Bar available to you,
These little bits of plastic you find inside;
You can use those as a quality guide,
Of the standard of Soap Bar that you are smoking,
The more bits of plastic means the better the toking.

Eat a Hash-cake but wait a while, 
it'll take about an hour ain't Draw versatile,
You can burn it, eat it, or smoke it in a spliff,
Space shakes, Draw gateau?s, you knows it Delia Smith,
Lying in your bed dropping blimps on your pubes,
Selling Draw to your mates but it?s really Oxo cubes,
When you're cooking up draw, be quick don't lick it,
Cause it?s really fucking hot and it'll burn your fingers.

This bloke said to me; ?You haven't got a clue,
About the damage that Soap Bar can do to you?,
I tried to see things from his point of view,
But I couldn't fit my head up his asshole too,
The bloke was wrong, I knows my stuff,
I knows if I smoke it, I'm gonna feel rough,
My lungs are fucked and my throat is raw,
Cause the thing about Soap Bar; it?s fucking hardcore.

Smoking on up, Soap Bar in the sky,
I?ll smoke Soap Bar ?till I fucking die,
Before I die and they lay me to rest,
I will always smoke Soap Bar, that's the best.

Well anyway I think it?s better myself to lean forwards,
When smoking Soap Bar, because you are less likely to Blim-Burn,
You know what I mean?

Innit, check it out man! I got some quality fucking Gold-Seal for you, innit?
Shape up all those little bits of plastic what you find inside, right,
And then fucking stick them in a teapot,
Makes a lovely cup of tea, that does.

What I do, stick a fag in the microwave, right,
You toke it up, you sticks the Draw on top,
And you rams it in a bong and you rams the bong in your fucking head.

Yeah that's like my fucking lungs feel like, 
they're fucking collapsing sometimes from the Soap Bar like,

Your Tesco tunic really drives me berserk

I'm for real, it ain't no quirk
My love is lurkin' the way a rapist would lurk
In a bush, or a car park in town
I bought you this necklace, it cost me 12 pounds

From Argos, Elizabeth Duke
Maybe you're the skywalker to my Luke
The Darth to the vader, flip over the crossfader
I'll serenade you with a bag of space raiders

Or Walkers or Smiths or maybe even Quavers
'cause my love for you is like drugs for ravers
With glow sticks and funny hats on
I loves you more than I loves my bong

Fantasy
You and me baby
You and me baby

Oh, you fuckin' knows I love you right
But the thing is it's like this
You see, I can feel it inside
I can't explain how it feels
My sexual love is for real

Girl, you knows it's true, like Milli Vanilli
I'll buy you ten fags on a day trip to Caerphilly
I'm after your heart, oh, don't you see?
And your three kids doesn't bother me
You know

I'll give you a rose, pull out your chair when we eat
Fuck I can't, in McDonald's it's a bolted seat
Don't matter 'cause I'm here with you
With a medium value meal and a chocolate sundae too

Later on I'll come and help you sign on
I'll stare into your eyes, the housin' benefits gone wrong
Don't worry, baby it won't take too long
I'm just sittin', I'm just waitin', I'm just writin' this song

You know that, time passes and I'm lovin' every second
Buyin' chips for you is as lovely as I reckoned
You're Victoria Spice, I'm David Beckham
If you were Dellboy, I'd be the streets of Peckham
Why don't you come to me? Why can't you see?
My love for you is like Matt Bolan to a tree

Dance with me
You and me, baby
You and me, baby
Tonight

I'll take you for a ride, we won't go far
You've been runnin' through my mind like a shinin' star
We've got plenty of time to make sweet love
""'cause tonight's the night we take off the glove

You know what I mean, you're takin' the pill
Don't worry, I'll sort out the bill
Supported by the D-H-S-S
With family allowance, we'll sort out the mess

What's it gonna take to get your attention?
A tracksuit and gold chain and semi erection
Say no more, I can feel the tear
You can smokes my fags and drinks my beer

I'll never want another like I want you
To prove my love, I gotta tattoo, on my bollocks
I was gonna have your name but I only got initials
'cause I couldn't stand the pain

My physical love
You and me baby
You and me baby
Tonight
The emotional reality

You're the nicest lookin' woman outside of my sexmags
Especially with your makeup, when your wearin' your Gladrags
I gotta tell you, I gotta let you know
I wanna buy you trips down the Mecca, Bingo

We'll sit together, get four in a row
And win a China dog and with it too a family show
This is romance, how it should be done
When it's you and me together, it can only spell fun

We'll walk together, buy some meat in the market
I'll piss on the car, you'll smile and park it
I've got to tell you about somethin' I think
Without you and my chain I'm the weakest link

So get down, baby, and feel my love
I'll get you drunk in Weatherspoons, into a bush I shove
I'll have a grope and get the last bus
A romantic date, just the two of us
Yeah, one time

Goldie Lookin Chain,"That's right, you knows what I'm saying
Your mother's offered me the goods, I'm not paying.
It started as a laugh, as a bit of a joke
Something funny to say when I was having a smoke.

I first heard off this bloke, this fucking rumour going round
Your mother's reputation it's not sound
She's saving up the pennies hoping they'd turn into pounds
To have an operation to swap her gender around.

It's a shock to me and it's a shock to you
Your mother's got a beard, sandals and a penis too
It don't look right see, when she's walking down the street
To see her ball bag jiggin' to the beat of her feet

I said
Your mother's got a penis
Your mother's got a penis
Your mother's got a penis
That's right
Your mother's got a penis

In internet rooms and computer mainframes
There's loads of females but your mother's blue veins.
Not the ones in her legs or the backs of her arms
But the ones in her member head and in her garms.

She walks around proud, with a short dress on
Which sometimes exposes the tip of her dong.
Often it's dripping, sometimes it's dry
No matter when I see her there's a tear in my eye.

I thought I had to tell you, had to put it in a letter
But I thought fuck that I'd write a song in much better.
The only way to do it, to really let you know
I could prove it because I gave it a blow.

It was purely accidentally because she got me really drunk
And she made me kiss her elephant trunk.
You know why? That's right
Your mother got a penis.

Your mother's got a penis (Your mother's got a penis)
Your mother's got a penis (Your mother's got a penis)

Your mother's got a penis (Your mother's got a penis)
Your mother's got a penis (Your mother's got a penis)
Your mother's got a penis (Let's Rock !)
That's right
Your mother's got a penis

When she walks down the street, then she walks like John Wayne
I just seen her pissing standing up again.
Don't make no sense when you see her here and there
She got a cock and balls and real pubic hair.

And a single eye that sometimes weeps
If she lying on the bed then she rubs it on the sheets
Or up against the door or the back of your neck
If your mother's around then you make a double check.

I hate to tell you with all due respect
Take your mother to the doctors because her front bum's wrecked.

You know why?
Your mother's got a penis (C'mon Wembley)

Your mother's got a penis (Your mother's got a penis)
Your mother's got a penis
Your mother's got a penis (Put your hands in the air, Wembley)

You said if we hit somebody we're suppose to say sorry
But you never say sorry daddy you yell now
Why did you tell that man that mommy just fell down
Mommy didn't fall down daddy's lying
Mommy why are you always sad and always crying?
Daddy why are you always mad you always fighting?
Why do you always say I'm bad even when I'm trying?
No I don't want to go to my room
I don't want to go to bed now I want to be with you
I don't want to daddy it's to early
I didn't mean it daddy I'm sorry I'm sorry
I promise I'll never say that again
I'm sorry daddy please don't hit me again
Please I'll be a good boy now
Don't put me in the room please don't turn the lights out

I'm sorry daddy that's all I want to say to you)

Daddy where were you
Where?where were you?just when I needed you
Mommy where were you
(golden child)
What up pops I ain't got to tell you my heart is as hard as a rock
Things have changed since I was the age six
Yet some situations stay the same
Like the way I conceal my pain
Growing up I'd swear my name was every profane thing a man could say
I used to make excuses like you weren't the one that hit her
It was just the liquor in ya
My dad the perfect example of hatred and why am I so bitter?
Ya told me real men don't cry that was a lie
You don't realize what goes on inside of my mind
As time passed my heart ran cold my emotions froze
Lost track of the bruises and the broken bones
Just once wanted to hear that you loved me
Wrap your arms around me and hug me yeah right
Remember the first time I couldnt feel the pain
It was when grandma came and took me to church
Where God relieved the hurt and he knows it took work
But I forgave you he could save you but the question is
Will you let him in it would be such a blessing
To see you as a changed man and holdin my mother's hand
