Marilyn Manson,"Sacrifice won’t suffice
Resurrection needs your death
To happen twice
Fall on my heart 
And burn and forge
Your tortured black-smitten
Into the sharpest fucking sword

Don’t assume that I’m always with you
It’s just where my mortal body happens to be
Don’t assume that I’m always with you
It’s just where my mortal body happens to be

No sin eater to slay
Us children of Cain
Watching monkey suicide
Sunday aids and church wine wash it away

Christ consciousness
Manifest to the golden ratio
Five or five hundred million years ago
We were 15 foot high
And to die
Was a bardot bridge
We never thought we’d cross
To burn down behind and below

No sin eater to slay
Us children of Cain
Watching monkey suicide
Sunday aids and church wine wash it away

Don’t assume that I’m always with you
It’s just where my mortal body happens to be
Don’t assume that I’m always with you
It’s just where my mortal body happens to be
So take your little black book
I see the way that you look in to it
I’ll eat it and I’ll cut my tongue
And all the pages you spread
Sweet as honey you said
But I'm choking on your bitter stories

Crowded morgue of mistakes
The sun stopped its smile
And frowned on me too
My re-built/re-mastered heart
Is smashed into its faces
And its face is confused
I cut my throat in two

For being a fool
But I didn't forgiveness
It was regret
Not an apology

All my life, though some have changed

There is no one compares with you
And these memories lose their meaning

For people and things that went before
I know I'll often stop and think about them

But little Lord Jesus no crying he makes.
I love thee, Lord Jesus! Look down from the sky,
And stay by my side until morning is nigh.

Close by me forever, and love me, I pray.

In our town, no scarlet ribbons, 
Not one ribbon for her hair.

I peeked in and on her bed, 
In gay profusion lying there, 
Lovely ribbons, scarlet ribbons.

Which tapes and dreams belong to you and which are mine?

So many habits that we'll have to break
And yesterday's we'll have to take apart

One day there'll be a song or something in the air again
To catch me by surprise and you'll be there again
A moment in what might have been

Where do you start? Do you allow yourself a little time to cry?
Or do you close your eyes and kiss it all goodbye? I guess you try
And though I don't know where and don't know when
I'll find myself in love again
I promise there will always be a little place no one will see
A tiny part within my heart, that stays in love with you

How time flies
When compassion dies
No stocking, no candy canes
No gingerbread, no safety net

No loose change, no change, no
Santa Claus is coming
'Cause Santa Claus ain't coming
No room at the Holiday Inn again
Well, maybe next year or when

December twenty-fourth, ten p.m.
Eastern standard time
I can't believe a year went by so fast
Time to see, what we have time to see

Turn the projector on first shot roger
With the fender guitar he just got out of hock
When he sold the car
That took him away and back

I found my song
He found his song
If he could just find Mimi
I tried you know I tried

Fade in on mark
Who's still in the dark
But he's got great footage
Which he's cut together

To screen tonight
In honor of Benny's wife
Muffy, Alison
Pulling Benny out of the east village location

Then again, maybe we won't screen it tonight
I wonder how Alison found out about Mimi?
Maybe a bird told her or an angel
I had a little hunch you could use, a little 'flow

Tutoring again? Negative
Back at you? No, no you, no
I rewired the ATM at the food emporium
To provide an honorarium to anyone with the code

The code, well
A N G E L

Yet robin hooding isn't the solution
The powers that be must be undermined
Where they dwell in a small exclusive
Gourmet institution

Where we overcharge the wealthy, clientÃ¨le
Let's open up a restaurant in Santa Fe
With a private corner banquette in the back
We'll make it yet, we'll somehow get to Santa Fe

But you'd miss New York before you could unpack
Mark, Roger, anyone? Help
Maureen?
It's Mimi, I can't get her up the stairs

No, she was huddled in the park in the dark
And she was freezing and begged to come here
Over here, oh, god
Got a light, I know you, you're shivering

She's been living on the street
We need some heat
I'm shivering
We can buy some wood and something to eat

I'm afraid she needs more than heat
I heard that
Collins will call for a doctor, honey
Don't waste your money on mimi, me, me

Hello-911? I'm on hold
Cold, cold, would you light my candle
Yes, we'll, oh God, find a candle

I should tell you
I should tell you
I should tell you
I should tell you

I should tell you
Benny wasn't any
Shh, I know
I should tell you why I left
It wasn't, 'cause I didn't

I know, I should tell you
I should tell you
I should tell you, I love you

Who do you think you are?
Leaving me alone with my guitar
Hold on there's something you
Should here

Marin Mazzie,"I'm sorry but I can't come out to play today. The sun is shining but I want it to go away. Life is waiting and I must answer the call, this time I'm not willing to take another fall. You touched me like no on ever has. But too bad now that is the past. I know that we were friends first, but emotions can't be put in reverse. Goodbye my love, Hello my friend this isn't a beginning but is it really the end? I won't forget all that we have been through. I just don't know if I love you or hate youWe had our highs, We had our lows. Only after that night, where it started at the show. Take my arm, hold on tight, that is when I thought everything would be right. Remember those songs? The ones on all those tapes? Now like the memories they're becoming erased. Removed your glasses, look in my eyes. You were all I loved, no you want to be despises. Goodbye my love, hello my friend this isn't a beginning but is it really the end? I won't forget all that we have been through, I just don't know I love you or hate you

Bouge la tête sur la rythmique, j'aimerais que l'on m'explique
Nord, Sud, Est, Ouest
Même dans l'rap game, que des chats domestiques
Ouais ça crame roule un stick
Drancy Nord sur le l'brolique
Carré, Triangle, R1, L1, Nicolai Bellic
On m'a souvent répété qu'il fallait qu'j'arrête de faire le fier
La vie c'est pas un film cainri, sérieusement redescend sur terre
Mais que veux-tu j'ai un flow de ouf et j'invite quiconque à mieux faire
J'viens du 93 y a des moments il faudrait qu'j'apprenne à me taire
J'marche un peu sur l'or qu'on veut déjà m'plaquer
Le rap c'est comme le corps humain non tu peux pas être parfait
J'vais tous vous manger comme du canard laquais
Comme ça on parlera plus de vous et ça sera bien fait
J'suis rentré dans le game parce que ça m'intéressait
Sur la table t'as que des bouteilles d'Henessy
Désolé pour vous si j'suis précis comme Messi
Regardez moi bien bande de cons j'suis le senseï
J'passe du rêve au cauchemar comme un débit différée
J'passe pas inaperçu alors que j'suis différent
Décidément j'ai pas vu les antécédents
Doucement j'vais sûrment me mettre à ser-dan

J'ai comme l'impression de me perdre, tous les jours à force de cotoyer la merde

J'vais tous vous faire disparaître pour X raisons, là ça devient rude
J'te vois et c'est pas idem, normal j'suis camouflé dans la brume
T'as l'habitude de t'faire lécher, tu roules du bout de la fac on t'fume
Tout ces pains autour de moi sont certifiés par Paul
La chance tu la vois pas venir, même en ayant une coupe une bol
Se faire niquer par une chatte, ça fait un mal de chien
Quand t'es seul rien qu'tu aboies, mais bizarrement là j'vois qu'tu miaules hein
Se prendre en photo, montrer son boule, est-ce vraiment l'objectif?
Dédipix à 14 ans, à poil, réunion collective
Moi c'que j'pense de toi, j'devrais le censurer
Même bloqué dans l'ascenseur, j'ferai pas la sangsue
Sincèrement j'te le dis, même sans sucer
J'ai de la fierté, oui j'en suis sûr, j't'aurais pas lâché en plein succès
Et merde, l'heure est grave fiston

Double MC rime avec import export
C'est pas les fonds de vos caisses mais les fonds marins nous qu'on extorque
Ça jacte trop dans mon davo, autant que 600 pouls

Egoïste, je le suis
Un mec sans cœur, pas déçu
Voila c'que j'suis devenu
Aujourd'hui j'rentre plus tôt que prévu
Un appel téléphonique m'a surpris
J'ai de suite compris l'imprévu
Une mauvaise nouvelle, j'ai appris
C'est la merde, dans mon village
Ça parle de décapitage
J'perds le sang-froid dans l'habitacle
A l'arrivée, pétage de câble
Je soulève des débris énormes
Des corps amputés, même des morts
Des sapes et des jouets de mômes
Des flammes forment le décor
Où est ma femme?
Où est mon gosse?
C'est la fin
Et tout ça
Parce que

J'dis la vérité, j'dis pas ça que pour faire de la mala
Je m'incrustais dans des ambiances, on me disait ""Que fais tu là?""
Maintenant je manque de rien, j'habite même dans une villa
Est-ce que j'aurai pris la grosse tête depuis que je suis dans Subliminal?
J'entends même tous les jours ""Est-ce que t'as serré Bella?""
Que j'ai même plus le temps de dormir sur un bon vieux matelas

You were wild, couldn't get enough
Gave my heart to another lover
Don't know how I ever let you go

Baby, ahh
I'm already someone else's

You were wild, couldn't get enough
Let's leave things the way they were

Choking on a chicken bone

There'll be just one survivor
The memory that I was yours
And you were mine
Everybody dies, dies
Chasing after time, time

No I don't wanna be afraid,
Afraid to die, die, die
I just wanna be able to say
That I have lived my life, life
Oh, all the things that humans do
To leave behind a little proof
But the only thing that doesn't die is love, love, love
Love, love

I'm forever chasing after time
But everybody dies, dies
If I could buy forever at a price
I would buy it twice, twice
But if the earth ends in fire
And the seas are frozen in time
There'll be just one survivor
The memories of our lifetime
Everybody dies, dies
Chasing after time, time

So keep me alive, alive",Immortal,2015

Wish we could escape, I would know where to go

Say those words, my conclusion

Hold me, know me, show me, you’re my blessing 
Free this hostage, heart ache 
Your possession, say you, when you say you, when you say you love me

Does anything I say or do have this effect on you 
I wonder if it did would you treat me like you do

Oh, you were fucking me

The burning fire, that freezes me
Your cold lies, they sicken me
Your evil breed it haunting me

Petit tu as un trop gros appétit la réalité est fade et sans saveur
Oublie tes rêves d'ados, comme tout le monde suis le troupeau

À l'heure où on nous braque avec un AK, 49.3 pour nous faire plier
Ma famille, ma famille, ma famille tout roule pour moi car ce sont mes moteurs
Mon carré VIP c'est mon cercle familial, pour eux j'brillais avant les projecteurs
I love you Comoria, I love you Massilia (Alléluia)
Mon image, mon discours, mon parcours, mon combat, tout ça c'est pour pouvoir leur faire honneur
Le cancer m'a volé un frère il n'y a que mes gosses pour éponger mes pleurs
Toujours debout à chanter que l'amour est le meilleur fusil contre la terreur
Je le décharge quand je chante, dans une MJC ou dans les Restos du Cœur
J'suis de retour plus humain que jamais envoyez-moi des sourires plus que des fleurs

Quase tudo o que eu sei
Era quase escravidão
Ela me tratava como um Rei
Ela fazia muitos planos
Eu só queria estar ali

Sempre ao lado dela
Eu não tinha aonde ir
Mas egoí­sta que eu sou
Me esqueci de ajudar
A ela como ela me ajudou

Ela também estava perdida
E por isso se agarrava a mim também
E eu me agarrava a ela
Porque eu não tinha mais ninguém
E eu dizia:
Ainda é cedo, cedo, cedo, cedo

Sei que ela terminou o que eu não comecei
E o que ela descobriu
Eu aprendi, também, já sei
Ela falou:
Você tem medo
Falamos o que não devia

Ela falou:
Mas eu não sei mais o que eu sinto por você
Vamos dar um tempo, um dia  a gente se vê
Cedo, cedo, cedo,
E eu dizia ainda é cedo, cedo, cedo",Ainda É Cedo,1994
Marina Lima,"Eu tenho febre, eu sei
É um fogo leve que eu peguei
Do mar, ou de amar, não sei

E que ele sabe como encantar
Por isso sou levada, e vou
Nessa magia de verdade

O fato é que sou sua amiga,
Ele me intriga demais
É um mundo tão novo
Que mundo mais louco,
Até mais que eu

É febre, amor,
E eu quero mais,
Tudo o que quero,
Sério,
É todo esse mistério",Charme Do Mundo,1994

Eu queria te ver 
Sentindo esse lance 
Tirando os pés do chão 
Típico romance

Lil Flip the Leprechaun, Slim Thug the Boss Hogg
Fin to put it all in why'all face

I got too much money, too much cash
I bought a new Lac and put it on chrome, without touching my stash
Like Lil Flip I can do that, Excursion candy blue tha?
Twenty two that, pounds of dro I done blew that
You should of knew that, the Slim Thug gon' shine
My ear rings cost a dime, I read Rolex Times
I'm top of the line, you can tell when I open my mouth
I bet nobody got mo' princess cut teeth, than the Boss
Open your mouth up you lost, I'm blinding these boys
I'm joining rocks in your blocks, in candy blue toys
Talking noise, 'cause I ain't old enough to drank
But I got mo' cash to last, than your daddy in the bank
I'm top rank, Slim Thug gon' talk the talk
Walk the walk, we can bet ball for ball
We some paid young G's, with too much cash
Too much flow and do', talking too much trash ha

[Chorus: Repeat 2X]
Too much money, too much cash
All why'all haters, can kiss our ass
We got too much money, too much cash
All why'all haters, can kiss our ass

Too much money is what I got, like Scarface I rap a lot
S-Type Jag straight off the lot, believe me dog I'm really hot
I'm swanging four's and thinking thoed, banging hoes and changing clothes
Smoking dro and doing shows, paper stack can never fold
I bought the car and I bought the house, I represent the Dirty South
Got more syrup than Waffle House, run through hoes like Marshall Faulk
I talk the talk and walk the walk, 'cause nigga I'm a G
Lil Flip is who I be, I know your gal know me
'Cause I wear a Roley, that look like a snowman
And I push a Jag, you just gotta see it man
I'm sitting on Dubs, kinda like a blank tape
You see them rocks in my teeth, ain't none of em fake
Give me a break, you think I'm lying or something
I'm at the mall with your hoe, and she buying me something
I'm a young pimp, with a whole lot of cash
And why'all haters, why'all can kiss our ass

[Chorus: Repeat 2X]

I got too much M-O-N-E-why
Anything I S-E-E, I be	-you-why
Pull a Bentley off the lot, and ran that thang in the wall
We throw Crys in the air laugh, and watch it fall
Watch me ball, as the Dub spin like a top
I got crunk when I stopped, and made my pop trunk wop
Girls bop, automatic cause I'm top of the line
I cut my beep past six, and I raise the top of your spine
I'ma shine, Sucka Free, Boss Hogg in a row
You can catch me fresh and braided, or rugged and fro
You see the Spre's on the car, I bet you my people like the rock
When girls see Tite, Flip and Slim they say... pulling cameras out
Damn I'm hot, when I hit the club I'm bound to line to the bar
And for the first hundred people, I'm insuring they car
Attracting your star, cause nigga my piece attracting your car
We got too much green, and that's real by far

(Watch the closing doors)

There's a baby girl
That I know
And she's so fine
I meet her everyday
After school
Walk her to the train
It's been some time
Cause what her papa don't know
Won't hurt me
Mama thinks that 
I'm a cutie
She can't date till her sweet sixteen
But we just tryin' a do our thang

So I meet her at the 2 train
Everyday
Riding all the way to 110th
I get to hold her hand
Whisper in her ear
The only time I get the time
Is on the 2 train
Is on the 2 train

We always meet in the back car
So no one else can interrupt
So much to talk about
So little time
I wish we didn't have to rush
Cause by 42nd - to have a listen
77nd - Reminiscing
96th Street - Watch start clicking
And I'm about to do my thang

So I meet her at the 2 train
Everyday
Riding all the way to 110th
I get to hold her hand
Whisper in her ear
The only time I get the time
Is on the 2 train
Is on the 2 train

I can't wait
'Till we don't have to worry 
'Bout what no one
Has to say
'Cause we'll be free
Won't have to sneak around no more
But we're here now
And the future's not so far away
So until that day I'll say

Riding all the way to 110th
I get to hold her hand
Whisper in her ear

Yeah I'm ready (Mario!)

(All I want to do - is do me, feel me? see'mon!)

[Chorus - Mario] (Cassidy)
Next time, why'all niggaz try and compare me
Remember I just turned 18 (18!)
That means I got 7 years to catch up, so what's up?!
Next time why'all underestimate me (Don't do that)
Recognize I just turned 18 (I'm still young)
That means I got 7 years to catch up, so what's up?

[Verse - Mario]
I brush the dirt off my shoulder
Push through the city in an all pearl Rover
One day I want to be just like my nigga Hova
But they don't want to let me be
Haters they been hatin
Sayin what I can't be
But I'm a stay up on they bumper
Keeping the radios jumpin all summer
Having your girl screaming just to take a picture
I'm settin up my features
My bank account's reachin
And everybody's peeking

[Chorus]

[Verse - Mario]
This is a funny situation
These guys I grew up havin crazy admiration for
Got the feelin that I'm trying replace them
But that ain't the case
I'm in a whole 'nother place
Trying build my estate
I gotta keep my Nike's nice and clean
Keep the women up to 25 chasing me
Got Mr. Davis pushin buttons in the Captains seat
That means more dough before I'm too old
That they seen before

[Chorus]

[Verse - Cassidy]
Hey yo Mario!
Don't let em get you heated homie
Just only go harder
Let em underestimate you like you Antonio Tarver
Plus the dudes that be hating is as old as your father
You got plenty time, you gone get plenty shine
I don't pay 'em any mind
They been trying critcize
But you can't live your life through another nigga's eyes
I'm the best and you young boys know so
I'mma fall back and let my young boy blow, let's go

And even though it's a want I need the sex
I hope it's just insecurity
'Cause I know she feelin' me
Diggin' the growth and the maturity
But I got hard luck
'Cause honey keep keepin' her guards up
So I'm just tryna' even the odds up
And that part sucks to have to keep goin' back in on her
When she knows that I been on her
Since Back in the days in Manhattan after the matinee
When she just happened to wave
That's when I knew she had the right shine (right shine)
And the right mind (right mind)
It's just on me to catch her at the right time (right time)
When I get her Imma grab her by the wrist
Pull her close to me, hug her and tell her this

What you want a cruise?
Avenues and a ride with a pair of shoes
Shining like a diamond sittin' high with raised latitude
(Ah ha) listen baby I could change your attitude
You chillin' with the king you ain't dealin' with them rapper dudes
(Hey) keep it real kick it with me is what you rather do
I was poppin' before you, gonna' be the same after you
I ain't gonna chase you, I'd rather replace you
In case you wonderin' I'm stuntin' and way major
If the ice don't matter, and the money don't phase you,
Cars don't impress you, I bet the sex will amaze you
Look you don't want to past the chance (hey)
Spend the summer in the bottom half of France
Don't be alarmed I don't mean no harm
I'll help you before I hurt you
I'm tryna' rebirth you
I wanna love you
I ain't just have to nail you

Offered her my shoulder

Even bought your sister one too
Just to name a few things you could do
To put a smile on her face

Never forget her favorite color
Little things to show how much you love her

For me to steal your breezy

Mario,"It's kinda crazy baby,
How I remember things (like where you came from and how you had nothin)
I went and made you fly,
Put extras on your ride, (didn't miss a birthday now you can't even remember mine)

You made it clear to me (you wasn't down for me),
(I may be blind baby) but now I see,
(You had things up your sleeve, don't even lie to me)
I even heard it from your family,

How could you let somebody lay where I laid?
How could you give him everything that we made?
How could you call him all the names that you used to call me?
How could you, how could you just forget about me?
How could you teach him all the things I thought you?
How could you put him up to the ghetto kama sutra?
How could you put me in the back and give him the front seat?
How could you, how could you just forget about me?

You must be out your mind,
You got a lot of nerve
(To think that I'm gon chill after all that shit I heard),
I damn near carried you,
I could've married you,
Good thing I found out before I bought that seven carat for you,
(I know you're sick about) the way I found you out,
(Go ahead and pack it out)
I hope he got romance in his house,
You should have thought of me before you hopped in the sheets,
Damn I can't believe that you did this to me

How could you let somebody lay where I laid?

How could you put me in the back and give him the front seat?
How could you, how could you just forget about me?

Girl I tried to give you everything,
Can't believe the ways you repaid me,
Girl you had it all,
But I guess my all wasn't good enough for you,
Baby I've accepted it,
And I ain't goin' trip,
Girl I'm movin' on,
Sometimes I give up and think that another man's gonna get the one that's in for me

How could you let somebody lay where I laid?
How could you give him everything that we made?
How could you call him all the names that you used to call me?

How could you, how could you just forget about me?

How could you how could you just go and lay there,
How could you how could just give him everything,
How could you how could you call him names like that,

Diggin the growth and the maturity
But I got hard luck
'cause' honey keep keepin' her guards up
So I'm just tryna' even the odds up
And that part sucks to have to keep goin' back in on her
When she knows that I been on her
Since Back in the days in Manhattan after the matinée
When she just happened to wave
That's when I knew she had the right shine (right shine)
And the right mind (right mind)
It's just on me to catch her at the right time (right time)
When I get her imma' grab her by the wrist
Pull her close to me, hug her and tell her this...

Since that time we had that intimate talk
Suddenly your acting strange
Plus your conversation just stopped n changed
Is it because your afraid
That what your feelin' for me 
Is the beginning of a new heart break 
Hear me when I say

You ain't gotta give me your love
You ain't gotta say am yours
You ain't gotta tell me where you been
Cause you ain't obligated to me
Am not sayin' that you should just rush an give me your heart
Am just askin' that you
Like me real hard
Just like me real hard

You know jus' like I know 
We've bin broken by love an we both need time to heal 
That's why in this short amount of time
We've grown so close 
You relate to everything I feel
So lets not complicate things 
By place' in titles on you and i
But what we can do before we make the next move
We gotta find a perfect reason why
So believe me when I say

You ain't gotta give me your love
You ain't gotta say am yours
You ain't gotta tell me where you been

And I ain't ready to care so much

But together we can work something out
And we'll know when the time is right
Because we'll feel it in our heart
And will be written in the stars

But she ain't even gotta fuck him cause he cain't get it up 
Tuesday - she with Claude, he on some treat her like a lady shit 
Chivalrous, pull the chair out and he's always there to babysit 
So - Wednesday and Thursday - she can go out and dance 
And if she met me, she probably had a one night stand 
Friday - she back wit'chu, kissin and cuddlin 
Talkin 'bout her hard week and lookin for love again 
Now I ain't tryin to tell you that you wrong for keepin her 
All I'm tryin to say is you don't own her, you leasin her 

[Chorus: Mario + (Rhymefest)] 
Are we, really sure (uhh, c'mon) 
That a love that's lasted for so long can still endure 
(Can it still endure?) 
Do I, really care (I don't know) Hey hey hey 
I'm talkin 'bout distractions, goin on elsewhere 

[Rhymefest] 
Look I'ma sing it one mo' time - man, don't get distracted 
Your woman cheat like you, only she better at it 
She come up with the plan befo'hand, befo' you even ask 
""Where was yo' ass?"" She tell you where she been and then 
Give you a hug, backrub, run the water for the tub 
By now, you done forgot she was a thug? 
Wait, you need some help stud 
Yo' girl wearin perfume and spandex like 
I'm goin to the health club with Sheryl 
(You know Sheryl!) Yeah you know Sheryl 
With two baby daddies, one for her and one for yo' girl 
And the whole world knows, but they cain't convince him 
That's his baby momma and he's so defensive 
She ride around in the Benz and spend them ends up 
Took me to the mall, I was so expensive! 
I ain't tryin to tell you not to give her your best 
But you might wanna still have a paternity test 

[Chorus: Mario + (Rhymefest)] 
Are we, really sure (are we really sure) 
That a love that's lasted for so long can still endure 
(Can it still endure?) 
Do I, really care, hey hey hey 
I'm talkin 'bout distractions, goin on elsewhere

Talkin 'bout it goin on elsewhere

Goin on elsewhere, goin on elsewhere

Mario,"[Verse 1]
What have I missed,
Living like this?
Who'd think I'd get this far,
Fancy house and my fancy car
Why you living like this?
Together as kids,
You were my best of friend,
All the trouble you got up in

[Bridge]
See I been deaf, and I been scared,
I been discriminated against and compared,
To you whose my brother, thanks to you I discovered
There's only one way to go in life and that's be right

[Chorus]
There's only one way to do right, right, right, right,
There's only one way to do right, right, right, right,
See me, I ain't always done right, right, right, right,
That's why I'm here to help you fight, fight, to do right

[Verse 2]
You were the queen in my future,
I was the one you was used to,
It was like we were one,
Up under the sun
And narcotics in your system,
The love I should have unlisted,
Now look what we've become,
But I shouldn't judge

[Bridge]

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Cause in life there are decisions to make but it's your choice,
But I chose to walk away, rather than wildin' out, and get locked away
See my friends all chose the fast money, but I chose my father
Cause I knew he'd come for me and recover me, already dead
See what I'm trying to say, is I'm trying to be the best man I can be
And when I see you too, struggling to do the best you can do
You may run into a rock, but you can't let it stop what's planned for you,
So make the right choice

[Chorus x2]",Do Right,2007

You know what

You're that everyday girl, a face like a magazine
Ya ass I wanna hold, every ghetto nigga'z fantasy, yeah, oh yeah

Hey, I think I really wanna be your lover
Not the one you wake up to
A nigga call and touch ya, don't wanna fuck you like no other
I'm not tryna range rov truck ya, or diamond clutch ya
Ain't really tryna meet yo mother, just wanna fuck you like no other

Come and get it (go), c'mon (go), come and get it (go), you know what [2x]

If it's good girl, why wouldn't I come back again
Little boys mess it up for me, and that I don't understand
When ya mouth's in ya hand yeah

[Bridge]

[Chorus]

How'd you like it,
And the way that you smile I can tell that you told your girlfriend
The way you showed up if I start fuckin' you it'll make ya world end yeah
Would it be a smile or a frown if I brought your girl in
Why you smirkin' yeah

[Bridge]

Those other guys go wrong with you (you,you)
They sell you dreams that they can't keep
They send you lies disguised as the truth (tru, truth)
They say the skies are green, that I've never seen
While I just say that it's blue (blue, blue)
You get the sun to me, bout you can't see
And I'll just say you are cute
I'll keep it short and clean

Mario,"I'm trying to save us girl...
They got that...
They got that kryptonite...

[Verse 1:]
It seems the more I try to do right,
The more I lie about being at sessions and leaving at certain times,
She's like, ""Where you at?""
I'm at the studio at home,
and I'm thinking to myself we cut that record days ago
Cause shorty on the east side, hit me and want to know if I could stop by,
Now I'm contemplating what I am gonna say, bout this being the umpteenth time that I'm late

[Chorus:]
I wanna be your superman,
I'm trying to save our love the best way that I can,
Cause these girls they're like kryptonite,
These girls my kryptonite,
These girls got kryptonite,
These girls my kryptonite,
And I really wanna make it work, but I cant stop messing round,
I keep doing dirt,
Cause these girls they're like kryptonite,
These girls my kryptonite,
These girls got kryptonite,
These girls my kryptonite,
Oh baby

[Verse 2:]
It's like the more I brush them off, the more they call,
The more I want to tell them that I'm not involved,
With anyone, when I know it's you,
Wanna tell the truth but it's just so hard to do,
Caught up in me again it's driving me crazy
It's the reason I won't tell em i got a lady,
Now I'm trying to contemplate on what I am gonna say, on this being the umpteenth time that I'm late

[Bridge:]
No matter what I do, I know that your my true love,
But I just cant help it to get caught up with all these broads,
Sittin' here with this mic in my hand,
Trying to make all the words to make my baby understand

[Chorus:]

oooh yeah yeah

[Verse 3:]
I want you to be my Louis Lane,
Girl I promise I'm gonna change, and it ain't gonna be this way forever,
Girl I'm gonna get myself together, cause your the one I love,
Because your like a drug that I can't get enough of,
I'm just so confused, don't know what to do,
Cause the way that it's feeling, I like how it's feeling,
It's getting so hard, to fight that feeling

[Rap: Rich Boy]
I'm a rich boy riding in my big superstar shit,
The one girls try to get they text me on my sidekick
Bring em to my palace, tell em take it off we make a flick,
Every night I do it so at least one chick I gotta get
Just like kryptonite them girls make me super weak,
Suck my dick and play with me until they put me straight to sleep,
Twenty girls on my sheets, seven days out the week,
It's hard trying to hold it down with groupies trying to get with me,
I stay dreaming, fantasizing, with my eyes closed,
I love you girl but I'm addicted to them hoes
If ballin' is a sin then God please forgive me,
My women so bad and my money so filthy really

I don't wanna take 'em off just yet let me watch
Let me watch
I don't wanna take 'em off just yet let me watch you

I can be all the man you wanna come home and talk to
Can't wait to take those right off you
Wanna do anything you need
If you just, please, open up, please
Let me watch, please, let me watch you

Pillowcases by the hot fireplace
Watch the bubbles overlap while I pour one in the glass
I came here to watch you, baby, to watch you
Don't be afraid of the couch cause, baby, I got you

Better yet, go and get up, I ain't gon' tell you again
Why don't you stand over me and let me see what it is
And maybe my tastin' with your rotation
Will show you why I couldn't wait to get to the crib

Damn you feel so good to me
I figured I should just take some time
And only do what a man needs to do
When a man there to keep his woman pleased

Wanna make sure that you come again
Wanna be the one you call again
To fulfill all your needs

Go on and put your hands around it
Damn, you put your hands around it

If I play with that, think about it
Do that lil' thing around it
Don't you dare try to leave without this
Just keep doin' what you're doin'

From her head to her clothes, how she throw it on
But I'm tryin' to see her take it off

I plan on goin' deep
You the ground, I'm the casket, I'm goin' six feet
Yeah, baby, I'm a fully loaded freak
One in the head, don't make me bust off my piece

Them other dudes soft like sheets
Me, I'm tryin' to get you on my sheets
Tobago shorts say 'pink'
Oh, those Victoria's Secrets

And I know how to keep a secret
So I won't tell nobody what we did
No but we could chill and pop Heavy bottles
We can ride in the Phantom while the Bentley follows

Not the way I planned it

How do I breathe?

Feels so different being here
I'm so used to being next to you
Life for me is not the same
There's no one to talk to

Don't know why I let it go too far
Starting over is so hard
Seems like everywhere I try to go
I keep thinking of you

I just had a wake up call
Should have never let you fall
Baby, you were not the blame at all
When I'm the one that pushed you away

Baby if you knew I care
You wouldn't have never went nowhere
Girl I should have been right there

How do I breathe?
Without you here by my side
How will I see?
When your love brought me to the light
Where do I go?

When your heart's where I lay my head
When you're not with me
How do I breathe?
How do I breathe?

Girl I'm losing my mind
Yes I've made a mistake
Thought that you would be mine
Guess the joke was on me

Miss you so bad I can't sleep
I wish I knew where you could be
Another dude is replacing me
God this can't be happening

Should have never let you fall
Baby, you were not the blame at all
When I'm the one that pushed you away

Baby if you knew I care
You wouldn't have never went nowhere (nowhere)
Girl I should have been right there

And now I wonder

How do I breathe?
Without you here by my side
How will I see?
When your love brought me to the light
Where do I go?

When your heart's where I lay my head
When you're not with me (I say)
How do I breathe?

I should’ve brought my love home, girl
And baby I ain’t perfect, you know
The grind has got a tight hold,
girl, come back to me
‘Cause girl you made it hard to breathe
when you’re not with me

Tell me, how do I breathe?

Just upped and changed
Is it because your afraid
What you feelin' for me

Is the beginning of a
New heart break?

I'm just askin' that you

You know just like I know
We've been broken by love
And we both need time to heal
That's why

In this short amount of time
We've grown so close
'Cause you relate to
Everything I feel

So let's not complicate things
By placing titles on you and I
But what we can do
Before we make the next move

We gotta find the perfect
Reason why

Work something out

There were too many goodbyes,
And I can't say I was so innocent,
Cause I told my share of lies,
But it seems like whenever I get close to her,
Love would just be away,
But just when I thought my chances were over,
I stared my future in the face.

I made a lot of broken promises,
I had no respect for words,
And I thought I got all that I'm against,

I cant help but sing along

What are we screamin' for?

Hear me grieving, I'm lying on the floor.
Whether I'm drunk or dead I really ain't too sure.

I'm a blind man, I'm a blind man and my world is pale.
When a blind man cries, Lord, you know there ain't no sadder tale.

Had a friend once in a room,
had a good time but it ended much too soon.
In a cold month in that room
we found a reason for the things we had to do.

I'm a blind man, I'm a blind man, now my room is cold.
When a blind man cries, Lord, you know he feels it from his soul.",When a Blind Man Cries,2014

J'voudrais bien réussir ma vie, être aimé
Etre beau gagner de l'argent
Puis surtout être intelligent
Mais pour tout ça il faudrait que j'bosse à plein temps

J'suis chanteur, je chante pour mes copains
J'veux faire des tubes et que ça tourne bien, tourne bien
J'veux écrire une chanson dans le vent
Un air gai, chic et entraînant
Pour faire danser dans les soirées de Monsieur Durand

Et partout dans la rue
J'veux qu'on parle de moi
Que les filles soient nues
Qu'elles se jettent sur moi
Qu'elles m'admirent, qu'elles me tuent
Qu'elles s'arrachent ma vertu

Pour les anciennes de l'école
Devenir une idole
J'veux que toutes les nuits
Essoufflées dans leurs lits
Elles trompent leurs maris
Dans leurs rêves maudits

Puis après je f'rai des galas
Mon public se prosternera devant moi
Des concerts de cent mille personnes
Où même le tout Paris s'étonne
Et se lève pour prolonger le combat

Et partout dans la rue
J'veux qu'on parle de moi
Que les filles soient nues
Qu'elles se jettent sur moi
Qu'elles m'admirent, qu'elles me tuent
Qu'elles s'arrachent ma vertu

Puis quand j'en aurai assez
De rester leur idole
Je remont'rai sur scène
Comme dans les années folles
Je f'rai pleurer mes yeux
Je ferai mes adieux

Et puis l'année d'après
Je recommencerai
Et puis l'année d'après
Je recommencerai
Je me prostituerai
Pour la postérité

Les nouvelles de l'école
Diront que j'suis pédé
Que mes yeux puent l'alcool
Que j'fais bien d'arrêter
Brûleront mon auréole
Saliront mon passé

Alors je serai vieux
Et je pourrai crever
Je me cherch'rai un Dieu

Se acabaron todas las falsas ilusiones
No existes ya, te fuiste ya

Todo ha cambiado, ya no quiero este amor de poquito
Si algo estoy claro es que no te necesito
Insisto que soltero se pasa más rico
Ahora en el DF jangueando con los chulitos
No llames más, no hay acuerdos, no hay negociaciones
No vale la pena que sigamos hablando de amor
Acuérdate que al cielo te subí
Te traté como ninguna, yo te bajé la Luna
Tantas oportunidades que te di, no aprovechaste ni una
(No aprovechaste ni una, girl)

Fuiste tú la que la llama apagó, baby
Y ahora este juego no está a tu favor

Por lo más que traten, me importa la manera en que me traten
Seguiré jugando to' los ases, ahora te conviene
Pero esta tarde y no me tienes, el malo que tú querías no te quiere
Tu falsedad me envolvió
Ahora todo terminó
Pensando que yo era el peor
Gracias a ti toy' mejor

With hinges on chimneys for stars to go by
A sweet slice of Heaven for just you and I
When we're alone.

From all of society we'll stay aloof
And live in propriety there on the roof.
Two heavenly hermits we will be in truth
When we're alone.

We'll see life's mad pattern
As we view old Manhattan
Then we can thank our lucky stars
That we're living as we are.

In our little penthouse we'll always contrive
To keep love and romance forever alive
In view of the Hudson just over the drive,

She won't leave him
I don't stand a chance

So she can fill this seat
It was never mine
No words can cure me
So I seek help from my friend called the radio

You told me that you'd let go
Now I have to tell you that

I'm not willing to settle for half of what's mine

Whisper on a breezy day
All through the rain
Roots grow deeper
Only on a sandy ground

It was never mine
No words can cure me
So I seek help from my friend called the stereo

Mario Fasciano,"By horse, by rail, by land, by sea, our journey starts
Two men incensed by one man's journey from the past
In Iceland, where the mountain stood with pride
They set off with their guide
To reach the mountain side

Roped as one for safety through the long descent
Into the crater of volcanic rock they went
Look up from our telescopic laair,
One star for us to share,
We continue on our prayer.

Crystals of opaque quartz, studded limpid tears,
Forming magic chandeliers, lighting blistered galleries.

Memories of a life on earth go flashing past,
Of home, of Grauben, friends of whom he's seen his last
Contemplating what his life's been worth,
While trapped beneath the earth,
An embryo at birth

Pain and fear destroy the beauty I have seen,
Of caverns, where no other man has been
Silurian epoch hosts me as my grave,
My final blow I wave,
A life too late to save

Crystals of opaque quartz, studded limpid tears,
Forming magic chandeliers, lighting blistered galleries.


Five days out on an infinite sea, they prayed for calm on an ocean free,
But the surface of the water ws indicating some disturbance.

The raft was hurled by an unseen source, two hundred feet, with
  frightening force
And a dark mass rising showed to be a giant porpoise

Rising out of the angry sea, towered the creatures' enemy,
And so the two sea monsters closed for battle

Crocodile teeth, lizard's head, bloodshot eye, stained ocean red
Moving close to their raft's side, the two men prayed as one and cried
""Save me, save me, save me, save me""

The serpents' fight went on for hours, two monsters soaring up like towers
And driving downn to the depths in a single motion

Suddenly, the serpent's head, shot out of the water bathed in red
And the serpentine form lay lifeless on the ocean

Crocodile teeth, lizard's head, bloodshot eye stained ocean read
Battle won, a victor's pride, the three men thanked the Lord and cried
""Praise God, praise God, praise God, praise God.""

Journey on through ages gone, to the centre of the earth
Past rocks of quartz and granite, which gave mother nature birth

Burial ground of ancient man, his life no more is seen,
A journey through his time unknown, I wonder where he's been

Wonder where he's been, wonder where he's been, wonder where he's been

The shore now gone behind the hills, a forest in our sight,
Rocks and distant mountains, bathed in waves of blinding light

Forests from far gone time, no living man has seen,
A private prehistoric world, for you and I a dream

Brownish hue dicates my eye, no colour hides their fear,
Flowers faded, dull and cold, now bleached by atmosphere

Creatures twisting under trees, huge monsters soaked with rage
Hidden deep below our earth, a frightening, bygone age

Their shepherd came, now long extinct, a huge primeval man
The three men filled with disbelief, just turned as one and ran.

prefiere no mirar,

Al amanecer
ya esta Miguel
sobre su barca.
""Dame un beso amor,
y espera quieta

""Maldito pescador!,
despidete de ella.
No quiero compartir su corazon"".

Y llorar, y llorar, y llorar por el.
Y esperar, y esperar, y esperar de pie

que esa roca blanca es Ana.
Cubierta de sal y de coral
espera en la playa.

No esperes mas, nina de piedra.
Miguel no va a volver.
El mar le tiene preso
por no querer cederle a una mujer.

Y llorar, y llorar, y llorar por el.
Y esperar, y esperar, y esperar de pie

que cuando hay tempestad

Sotto una terra ingrata che promette e limita

Can reach across forever
A long weekend, my mother's friend
You came in search of weather

The women I saw, I'd seen years before
But never like this
Your kiss on my cheek, said
""Find if you seek a moment of bliss""

I'll never forget you, don't ever regret you
You opened my eyes
Wherever I go in this world, as I stumble on shifting sand
You were there, when a boy turned man

Secretly it had to be
Though honest was our passion
And every moment in your arms
Made mockery of fashion

And after the glow
The talk of the soul
Will stay deep inside

I'll never forget you, I'll always respect you
You opened my eyes
Whatever I do in this life
As I battle against the tide

I'll never forget you, I'll always respect you
You opened my eyes
Wherever I go in this world, as I stumble on shifting sand

Like I've never seen the sky before
Want to vanish inside your kiss
Everyday I love you more and more

Listen to my heart, can you hear it sings?
Telling me to give you everything
Seasons may change winter to spring
But I love you until the end of time

Come what may, come what may
I will love you until my dying day

Suddenly the world seems such a perfect place
Suddenly it moves with such a perfect grace
Suddenly my life doesn't seem such a waste
It all revolves around you

And there's no mountain too high, no river too wide
Sing out this song and I'll be there by your side
Storm clouds may gather and stars may collide
But I love you until the end of time

Come what may, come what may

Sing as if no one is listening to what you're hearing

Yet the thought of losing you's been hanging 'round my mind 
Far more frequently you're wearing perfume
With you say no special place to go
But when I ask will you be coming back soon
You don't know, never know 
Well, I'm a man of many wishes
Hope my premonition misses
But what I really feel my eyes won't let me hide
'Cause they always start to cry
'Cause this time could mean goodbye 
Lately I've been staring in the mirror
Very slowly picking me apart
Trying to tell myself I have no reason with your heart 
Just the other night while you were sleeping
I vaguely heard you whisper someone's name
But when I ask you of the thoughts your keeping
You just say nothing's changed 
Well, I'm a man of many wishes
I hope my premonition misses
But what I really feel my eyes won't let me hide
'Cause they always start to cry
'Cause this time could mean goodbye, goodbye

And it ain't what the moon did
I got what I paid for now
See you tomorrow
Hey Frank can I borrow
A couple of bucks from you
To go waltzing Matilda waltzing Matilda
You'll go waltzing Matilda with me

I'm an innocent victim
of a blinded alley
And I'm tired of all these soldiers here
No-one speaks English
And everything's broken
And my strength is soaking away
To go waltzing Matilda, waltzing Matilda
You'll go a waltzing Matilda with me

Now the dogs they are barking 
and the taxi cab's parking
A lot they can do for me
I begged you to stab me
You tore my shirt open

And I'm down on my knees tonight
Old bush mills I staggered
You buried the dagger
Your silhouette window light
To go waltzing Matilda, waltzing Matilda
You'll go a waltzing Matilda with me
Now I've lost my St. Christopher
Now that I kissed her

And the one-arm bandit knows
And the maverick China man
with the cold-blooded sigh
And the girls down by the striptease shows go
Waltzing Matilda, waltzing Matilda
You'll go a waltzing Matilda with me
No I don't want your sympathy
Fugitives say

that the streets aren't for dreaming now
Manslaughter dragnet
and the ghost that sells memories
Want a piece of the action anyhow
Go waltzing Matilda, waltzing Matilda
You'll go waltzing Matilda with me
And you can ask any sailor
And the keys from the jailor

And the old men in wheelchairs know
That Mathilda's the defendant
She killed about a hundred
And she follows wherever you may go
Waltzing Matilda, waltzing Matilda
You'll go waltzing Matilda with me
And it's a battered old suitcase
in a hotel someplace

And a wound that would never heal
No prim-donas the perfume is on
and old shirt that is stained with blood and whiskey
And goodnight to the street-sweepers,
The night watchmen flame-keepers
And goodnight Matilda too
Goodnight Matilda too.",Tom Traubert's Blues,2002

Enchantment is borne on the breeze
And clothes in the silver of tender moonlight
The birds murmur soft in the trees

As deep in the shadow your eyes look in mine
Within them a soft flame gently glows
The breath of the night wind is filled with the scent of the rose
Oh, love while I live, I will always enshrine
Your love in the heart of a rose

Deep in my heart, dear
I have a dream of you
Fashioned of starlight
Perfume of roses and dew

Our paths may sever
But I'll remember forever
Deep in my heart, dear
I'll always dream of you

I've waited a lifetime for someone to say
The things you are saying to me
And darling, believe every word that I say
Just look in my eyes and you'll see
You smile and my tears have all melted away
My worries were all false and naught

It looks like the start of a beautiful day
Just holding you here in my arms
With you every day's a beautiful day
As long as I'm here in your arms

Deep in my heart, dear
I have a dream of you

Mario Lanza,"I know you,
I walked with you once upon a dream
I know you,
That look in your eyes is so familiar a gleam
And I know its true
That visions are seldom all they seem
But if i know you
I know what you'll do
You'll love me at once,like what you did once upon a dream.
Once upon a night,
I dreamed we'd be together
In love forever.
Once upon a night,
I was wishing for a never,
A never ending.

Mario Lanza,"Oh, Danny boy, the pipes, the pipes are calling
From glen to glen, and down the mountain side.
The summer's gone, and all the roses falling,
It's you, it's you must go and I must bide.

But come ye back when summer's in the meadow,
Or when the valley's hushed and white with snow,
It's I'll be here in sunshine or in shadow,
Oh, Danny boy, oh Danny boy, I love you so!

But when ye come, and all the flowers are dying,
If I am dead, as dead I well may be,
You'll come and find the place where I am lying,
And kneel and say an Ave there for me.
And I shall hear, though soft you tread above me,
And all my grave will warmer, sweeter be,
For you will bend and tell me that you love me,
And I shall sleep in peace until you come to me!",Danny Boy,1995

In the nighttime when I dream

And my heart begins to break

But you said goodbye to me
Now all I can do is grieve
Can it be that you forgot?

And leave this heart that's broken

That makes the lonely winter seem long.
You are the breathless hush of evening
That trembles on the brink of a lovely song.

Some day my happy arms will hold you, 
And some day I'll know that moment divine,
When all the things you are, are mine!

Our summer day withers away
Too soon, too soon.

We're swept apart too soon.

Speak low, darling speak low,
Love is a spark lost in the dark,
Too soon, too soon,
I feel wherever I go
That tomorrow is near, tomorrow is here
And always too soon.

Time is so old and love so brief,
Love is pure gold and time a thief.

Speak love to me and soon.",Speak Low,2001

Gay and tender
Love came to me
Sweet surrender

In bright romantic splendor
Fickle was she
Faithful never

And clever

Softly, as in a morning sunrise
The light of love comes stealing
Into a new born day, oh
Flaming with all the glow of sunrise

The vow that all betray
For the passions that thrill love
And lift you high to heaven
Are the passions that kill love
And let you fall to hell

Out of every door?
No, it?s just on the street where you live.

Just to know somehow you are near
The overpowering feeling
That any second you may suddenly appear.

People stop and stare
They don?t bother me,
For there?s no where else on earth
That I would rather be.

Let the time go by,

They have little to offer but the songs they sing
And the plentiful waste of time of day

The hopes and fears of all the years
Are met in thee to-night.

And gathered all above,
While mortals sleep, the angels keep
Their watch of wondering love.
O morning stars, together
Proclaim the holy birth!
And praises sing to God the King,
And peace to men on earth.

How silently, how silently,
The wondrous gift is given!
So God imparts to human hearts
The blessings of his heaven.
No ear may hear his coming,
But in this world of sin,
Where meek souls will receive him, still
The dear Christ enters in.

Where children pure and happy
Pray to the blessed Child,
Where misery cries out to thee,
Son of the mother mild;
Where charity stands watching
And faith holds wide the door,
The dark night wakes, the glory breaks,
And Christmas comes once more.

Descend to us, we pray;
Cast out our sin and enter in,

It is the night of the dear savior's birth
Long lay the world in sin and sorrow pining
'Til He appeared and the soul felt its worth
A thrill of hope, the weary world rejoices
For yonder breaks a new and glorious morn
Fall on your knees, oh, hear the angel voices
O night divine, O night when Christ was born
O night divine, O night, O night divine 

Truly He taught us to love one another
His law is love and His gospel is peace
Chains he shall break, for the slave is our brother
And in his name all oppression shall cease
Sweet hymns of joy sing we
Let us praise His holy name
Christ is the Lord, his name ever, ever praise we
His power and glory ever more proclaim
His power and glory ever more proclaim

Fall on your knees, oh, hear the angel voices

Mario Lanza,"Ever since I was a young boy,
I've played the silver ball.
From Soho down to Brighton
I must have played them all.
But I ain't seen nothing like him
In any amusement hall,
That deaf dumb and blind kid

Sure plays a mean pinball!

He stands like a statue,
Becomes part of the machine.
Feeling all the bumpers
Always playing clean.
He plays by intuition,
The digit counters fall.
That deaf dumb and blind kid

Sure plays a mean pinball!

He's a pinball wizard
There has got to be a twist.
A pin ball wizard,
Got such a supple wrist.

('How do you think he does it?)
I don't know!
(What makes him so good?')

Well, he ain't got no distractions
Can't hear those buzzers and bells,
Don't see lights a flashin'
Plays by sense of smell.
Always has a replay,
And never tilts at all
That deaf dumb and blind kid

Sure plays a mean pinball.

He can't beat me now
I've always been the champ
I know every trick
No freak's gonna beat my hand

Even on my usual table,
He can beat the best.
His disciples lead him in,
And he just does the rest.

He's got crazy flipper fingers,
I never seen him fall,
That deaf, dumb, blind kid,
Sure plays a mean pinball.

He's a pinball wizard,
There has to be a twist.
A pinball wizard,
Got such a supple wrist.

He's a pinball wizard,
His score's a trillion more.
A pinball wizard,
The world's new pinball lord.
He's scoring more!
He's scoring more!
More more more more!

I thought I was the Bally table king,
But I just handed my pinball crown to him.
To him!
To him!",Lolita,2012
Mario Lanza,"Deaf Dumb and blind boy
He's in a quiet vibration land
Strange as it seems his musical dreams
Ain't quite so bad.

Ten years old
With thoughts as bold as thought can be
Loving life and becoming wise
In simplicity.

Sickness will surely take the mind
Where minds can't usually go.
Come on the amazing journey
And learn all you should know.

A vague haze of delerium
creeps up on me.
All at once a tall stranger I suddenly see.
He's dressed in a silver sparked

Glittering gown
And His golden beard flows
Nearly down to the ground.
Nothing to say and nothing to hear

And nothing to see.
Each sensation makes a note in my symphony.
Sickness will surely take the mind
Where minds can't usually go.

Come on the amazing journey
And learn all you should know.
His eyes are the eyes that
Transmit all they know.

Sparkle warm crystalline glances to show
That he is your leader
And he is your guide
On the amazing journey together you'll ride.

Like the circles that you find in the windmills of your mind!
 
Like a tunnel that you follow to a tunnel of its own
Down a hollow to a cavern where the sun has never shone
Like a door that keeps revolving in a half forgotten dream

Like a clock whose hands are sweeping past the minutes of its face
And the world is like an apple whirling silently in space
Like the circles that you find in the windmills of your mind!
 
Keys that jingle in your pocket, words that jangle in your head
Why did summer go so quickly, was it something that you said?
Lovers walking along a shore and leave their footprints in the sand
Is the sound of distant drumming just the fingers of your hand?
Pictures hanging in a hallway and the fragment of a song
Half remembered names and faces, but to whom do they belong?
When you knew that it was over you were suddenly aware
That the autumn leaves were turning to the color of her hair!

That feelin' goes stealin' down to my shoes
While I just sit here and sigh, ""Go 'long blues"".

I always get that mood indigo, 
Since my baby said goodbye. 
And in the evenin' when the lights are low, 
I'm so lonely I could cry. 
'Cause there's nobody who cares about me, 
I'm just a poor fool that's bluer than blue can be. 
When I get that mood indigo, 
I could lay me down and die. 

You ain't never been blue; no, no, no, 
You ain't never been blue, 
Till you've had that mood indigo. 
That feelin' goes stealin' down to my shoes
While I just sit here and sigh, ""Go 'long blues"".",Mood Indigo,1996
Mario Pezzotta,"It must have been moonglow, way up in the blue
It must have been moonglow that led me straight to you
I still hear you sayin', ""Dear one, hold me fast""
And I keep on prayin', ""Oh Lord, please let this last""

We seemed to float right through the air
Heavenly songs seemed to come from everywhere

And now when there's moonglow, way up in the blue
I'll always remember, that moonglow gave me you

It must have been moonglow, way up in the blue
It must have been moonglow that led me straight to you
I still hear you sayin', ""Sweet child, hold me fast""
And I keep on prayin', ""Oh Lord, please let this last""

We seemed to float right through the air
Heavenly songs seemed to come from everywhere

And now when there's moonglow, way up in the blue
I'll always remember, that moonglow gave me you",Moonglow,1996
Mario Pezzotta,"When I hear that Serenade in blue
I'm somewhere in another world, alone with you
Sharing all the joys we used to know
Many moons ago

Once again your face comes back to me
Just like the theme of some forgotten melody
In the album of my memory
Serenade in blue

It seems like only yesterday
The small cafe, a crowded floor
And as we danced the night away
I hear you say forever more
And then the song became a sigh
Forever more became goodbye
Cause you remained in my heart, but

Tell me darling in there still a spark?
Or only lonely ashes of the flame we knew
Should I go on whistling in the dark,
Serenade in blue",Serenade in Blue,1996
Mario Pezzotta,"In my solitude
You haunt me
With dreadful ease
Of days gone by

In my solitude
You taunt me
With memories
That never die

I sit in my chair
And filled with despair
There's no one could be so sad
With gloom everywhere
I sit and I stare
I know that I'll soon go mad

In my solitude
I'm afraid
Dear Lord above
Send back my love
I sit in my chair

Filled with despair
There's no one, no one
No onecould be so sad
With gloom everywhere
I sit and I stare
I know that I'll soon go mad

In my solitude
I'm afraid
Dear Lord above
Send back my love

Mario Pezzotta,"It was down by old Joe's barroom, on the corner of the square
They were serving drinks as usual, and the usual crowd was there
On my left stood Big Joe McKennedy, and his eyes were bloodshot red
And he turned his face to the people, these were the very words he said

I was down to St. James infirmary, I saw my baby there
She was stretched out on a long white table, 
So sweet, cool and so fair

Let her go, let her go, God bless her
Wherever she may be
She may search this whole wide world over
Never find a sweeter man as me

When I die please bury me in my high top Stetson hat
Put a twenty dollar gold piece on my watch chain
The gang'll know I died standing pat

Let her go, let her go God bless her
Wherever she may be
She may search this wide world over
Never find a sweeter man as me

I want six crapshooters to be my pallbearers
Three pretty women to sing a song
Stick a jazz band on my hearse wagon
Raise hell as I stroll along

Let her go Let her go
God bless her
Wherever she may be
She may search this whole wide
World over
She'll never find a sweeter
Man as me",St. James Infirmary,1996
Mario Pezzotta,"I hate to see that evening sun go down
I hate to see that evening sun go down
Cause my baby, he's gone left this town

Feelin' tomorrow like I feel today
If I'm feelin' tomorrow like I feel today
I'll pack my truck and make my give-a-way

St. Louis woman with her diamond ring
Pulls that man around by her, if it wasn't for her and her
That man I love would have gone nowhere, nowhere

I got the St. Louis blues, blues as I can be
That man's got a heart like a rock cast in the sea
Or else he wouldn't have gone so far from me

I love my baby like a school boy loves his pie
Like a Kentucky colonel loves his mint 'n rye
I love my man till the day I die",St. Louis Blues,1996
Mario Piacentini,"It seems like a dream, yet I know it happened
A man, a maid, a kiss, and then goodbye
Romance was the theme
And we were the players
I never think of this without a sigh
 
Lover, one lovely day
Love came, planning to stay
Green Dolphin Street supplied the setting
The setting for nights beyond forgetting
And through these moments apart memories live in my heart
When I recall the love I found on
I could kiss the ground on Green Dolphin Street

A song in blue
Like a flower crying
For the dew
That was my heart serenading you
My prelude to a kiss

If you hear a song that grows
From my tender sentimental woes
That was my heart trying to compose
A prelude to a kiss

Though it's just a simple melody
With nothing fancy
Nothing much
You could turn it to a symphony
A Shubert tune with a Gershwin touch

Oh how my love song gently cries
For the tenderness within your eyes
My love is a prelude that never dies

Venus, if you will
Please send a little girl for me to thrill

Venus, make her fair
A lovely girl with sunlight in her hair
And take the brightest stars up in the skies
And place them in her eyes for me

Venus, goddess of love that you are
Surely the things I ask
Can't be too great a task

Venus, if you do
I promise that I always will be true
I'll give her all the love I have to give
As long as we both shall live

Each little moment is clear before me
And though it brings me regret
