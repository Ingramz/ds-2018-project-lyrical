Othello Anderson,"Some day, when I'm awfully low,
When the world is cold,
I will feel a glow just thinking of you
And the way you look tonight.

Yes you're lovely, with your smile so warm
And your cheeks so soft,
There is nothing for me but to love you,
And the way you look tonight.

With each word your tenderness grows,
Tearing my fear apart,
And that laugh that wrinkles your nose,
It touches my foolish heart.

Lovely
Never, ever change.
Keep that breathless charm.
Won't you please arrange it?
'Cause I love you...Just the way you look tonight.

Mm, Mm, Mm, Mm,
Just the way you look tonight.",The Way You Look Tonight,2002
Othello Molineaux,"Love is funny or it's sad, 
Or it's quiet or it's mad,
It's a good thing or it's bad,
But beautiful!

Beautiful to take a chance
And if you fall, you fall,
And I'm thinking I wouldn't mind at all.
Love is tearful or it's gay.
It's a problem or it's play,
It's a heartache either way,
But beautiful!

And I'm thinking if you were mine
I'd never let you go,
And that would be but beautiful I know.",But Beautiful,1993
Other Lives,"When the whites of your eyes come through
You'll see something new
With your body and mine restored
It's good to see you back home

When the life in your eyes wants black
Things return
You've come back
With your body and mine restored
It's good to see you once more

Turning black tables
And you're turning black tables
And you're making your head whirl
Making your head whirl

And you're turning black tables
And you're turning black tables
And you're making your head whirl
Making your head whirl",Black Tables,2009
Other Lives,"I was waiting in the dark age
Searching for the ones in my life
I'm so far away
But I had hit the ground runnin'

Steady as you go, I don't mind
I'm still here today
Oh, spouting hymns and all's in them
And forever target when it ain't so kind

But it feels like forever
When your mind turns to fiction

And I had took the long way
And I was in the heat and I don't mind
I'm so far away

But it feels like forever
When you mind turns to fiction

Imagine the darks from the skull
In a night without sleep
Vibration comes
First suit I had in months without feet

Spouting hymns and all's in them
And forever target when it ain't so kind

But it feels like forever
When your mind turns to fiction",For 12,2011
Other Men,"I'm a little girl when I?m around you
I'm a screaming little bitch
It's a problem I have
It's a madness I share
That plane has flown away
The town is burning and it's so near you
The wind is turning and we can breathe soon
Black windows
Melting floors
Burning frames
Open sores
Some will learn
Others are doomed to repeat it again
Other people will never understand
Some would say the smart ones don't even care
I would care",Other People,2007
Other Side,"Ein bißchen Spaß muß sein, dann ist die Welt voll Sonnenschein!So gut wie wir uns heute verstehn, so soll es weitergehen!Ein bißchen Spaß muß sein, dann kommt das Glück von ganz allein!Drum singen wir tagaus und tagein: Ein bißchen Spaß muß sein!
Heut nacht feiern wir,
Machen durch bis um vier.Fragen nicht nach Zeit und Geld,weil es dir und auch mir so gefällt.
Ein bißchen Spaß muß sein, ...
Draußen wird's langsam hell,und die Zeit geht viel zu schnell.Noch ein Glas und einen Kuß,ja, und dann ist noch lange nicht Schluß.
Ein bißchen Spaß muß sein, ..

Other Star People,"Of all the things I've believed in
I just want to get it over with
Tears from behind my eyes but I do not cry
Counting the days pass me by

I've been searchin' deep down in my soul
Words that I'm hearin' are starting to get old
It feels like I'm startin' all over again
The last three years were just pretend
And I said

Goodbye to you
Goodbye to everything that I knew
You were the one I loved
The one thing that I tried to hold onto

I still get lost in your eyes
And it seems that I can't live a day without you
Closin' my eyes and you chase my thoughts away
To a place where I am blinded by the light
But it's not right

Goodbye to you
Goodbye to everything that I knew
You were the one I loved
The one thing that I tried to hold on to

Why did you treat me so bad?
Too late

Leaving me no escape,
With the weight of the world hanging over me.

Gotta keep from going under,
Won't bury me alive.
Gotta get, get out from under,
To let the fear run dry.

There's no way it's taking me, taking me tonight.

'Cause I still believe, inside of me,
There's someone not unspoken, someone not so broken.
I still believe, in spite of me,
And what I have become,
I'll find the one I used to be,
To bring me full circle.

Suddenly it's all coming clear,
That what I have lost and what has led me here, was all a lie.

The lies that I would tell,
The truth that I would hide,
Are poisoning the well.
But I'm not giving in, no,
To the enemy inside,
It'll never take me without a fight.

The ambulance outran the hearse, you sure you wanna ride?

There’s something about the way you move
That I can’t explain
There’s something about the light in you
And it takes away the pain

The metal tears into my flesh, and poisons me inside

’Cause broken bones can’t break my soul, or take away my pride
I’m gonna steal your precious heart of gold
I want you by my side

It's yo' life, let 'em know somethin'

I come from where they pop they collars
And couldn't be saved by Creflo Dollar
'Cause I'll probably never ever see the pearly gates
At the rate I'm goin' now, it'll be too late

Take life taste it, get on and smell it
You know what Charlie is, well it's sucker repellent
I spray myself with it every morning, you dig?
I spray myself right before I leave the crib

Hot ones echo through the ghetto, bullets ricochet
I'm bendin' corners in my Cadillac escalate
It's summertime and I'm scorchin', fuck a bulletproof
I'm hella keyed and I'm perkin' off that num-num juice

I'm in the traffic with my music on storm
Got a ticket just for blowin' my, horn
The real, pinkie ring, princess cut
Carats on, around my neck

Lookin' like some clones, be at yo' best
We don't play checkers no more, we play chess
One trey tri trey double [Incomprehensible]

Used to sell taffy, white girl nasal candy
Hoes'll dress tacky, just so I can bank they dome
Bank 'em make them think I'm broke
Use the dope game as a steppin' stone

My million dollar spot, way too cold
So many record haters, my back against the wall
When I was growin' up I seen a lot of rappers ball

Bring the yellow tape, it's on, on sight
You wanna squash the funk? Shoot me a peace kite
Where the party at? Who got that Carlos Rossi?
Who in my drinkin' club? Girl I'm 'bout to mob somebody

I'm fee-ed-exin', [Incomprehensible]

From the ground up

Oh they love the way us players ball
No doubt, that's how we do this
It's all about you Mayne
It's yo' life, let 'em know somethin'

I come from where they pop they collars
And couldn't be saved by Creflo Dollar
'Cause I'll probably never ever see the pearly gates
At the rate I'm goin' now, it'll be too late

Take life taste it, get on and smell it
You know what Charlie is, well it's sucker repellent
I spray myself with it every morning, you dig?
I spray myself right before I leave the crib

Hot ones echo through the ghetto, bullets ricochet
I'm bendin' corners in my Cadillac escalate
It's summertime and I'm scorchin', fuck a bulletproof
I'm hella keyed and I'm perkin' off that num-num juice

I'm in the traffic with my music on storm
Got a ticket just for blowin' my, horn
The real, pinkie ring, princess cut
Carats on, around my neck

Lookin' like some clones, be at yo' best
We don't play checkers no more, we play chess
One trey tri trey double [Incomprehensible]
H I double L sideshow

All about my fetti-oh, one-time want to see me fold
It's ob-vious I'm humongous, acres cars and businesses
All about my fetti-oh, bank account got to be tall
Diamonds on my wrists and shit, tycoon stickin' to the script, beotch

Straight up out the game
The realest nigga you done talked to all day
It's the dry season, outsmart the po'-po's
Cookin' birdies in the kitchen, with see-bo

From livin' nappy, everybody know me
Used to sell taffy, white girl nasal candy
Hoes'll dress tacky, just so I can bank they dome
Bank 'em make them think I'm broke
Use the dope game as a steppin' stone

[Incomprehensible] next steal walkie talkies
I'm the one that really-natin' them faulty chips
I got the gift of gab, I'm off the choo choo track

Oh Earl, that's yo' life

Oh Earl, that's yo' life

The street life, ballin' outta control
My million dollar spot, way too cold
So many record haters, my back against the wall
When I was growin' up I seen a lot of rappers ball

Bring the yellow tape, it's on, on sight
You wanna squash the funk? Shoot me a peace kite
Where the party at? Who got that Carlos Rossi?
Who in my drinkin' club? Girl I'm 'bout to mob somebody

I'm fee-ed-exin', [Incomprehensible]

The projects, and the beat down, renovated apartment complexes
Smell me!

Uh, you in a new school whip
Custom painted candy apricot butter
I'm in an antique old school four do'
Muffler draggin beat up duster
With scrapes and scratches, nicks and scars
Y'all get to drink out of wine glasses
We gotta drink out of jelly jars
Down and out like four flat tires no washing machine nor dryer
Just a pillowcase sack and a bunch of clothes wrapped
In a sheet on our way to the laundrymat
Will I ever get paid, can I make a dollar out of fifteen cents?
Y'alls got it made, we broke and starvin' barely payin' the rent
Sleepless nights, alligator t-uh-tears
Mommy arguin wit' my daddy, daddy drunk too many beers
911 Mr Po-Po, dey ain't happy wit' day marriage
Pops tryna beat her down and make her have a miscarriage
My cousin shoots the needle, she be gone for days
She on that da-ah-diesel, she gone end up wit' AIDS
I told her I love her I swear I just told her
But you know what she said to me?
Everybody got a gay or at least one dopefiend in they family
You ain't the only one wit' a reject in yo' family

The laughin' stock patna, we ain't got no cash
Feet stinkin through my shoes in PE class
I'm thriznew with biznein briznoke, I'm about to hiznit the griznind
And if I get popped it ain't half no more it's 80% percent of my time
But that's ah cha-ah-chance, that I'ma have to-ah-take
Today my son birthday and I can't even buy a cake
I'm so damn through-a-through, I had a JOB
You want me to cut my perm, oh y'all gone ave to fire me
My fellow just got out da joint, thought he might be okay
But my fellow got out and got stapled 26 times the same damn day
Who wanna get dunked on? In the the flatlands it ain't never too late
Patna all we need is a piece of plywood and a milk carton crate
What about dat shopping basket, you know I'm smart
We can gone take the wheels off that and ma-a-make a go cart
Yo peoples blessed you, I started from a quarter ounce
You came in the dope game wit' a silver spoon up in yo' mouth
Why we gotta gamble maine we hurtin', you got all the bucks

You know, the trials and tribulations, you dig?

Y'know we just tryin' to do our thing

I remember when I was just a young boy
Growin' up things was real hard for me
No food on the table, no clothes on my back
Lord have mercy
But my mother told me to stay strong

Fever yea I burn forsooth

""Daddy won't you treat him right?""

They give you fever when you kiss them

I stood there like I was hypnotized
You sent a feeling to my spine

When we kissed, ooh what a thrill
You took my hand and, ooh baby, what a chill
I felt like grabbin' you real tight
Squeeze and squeeze with all my might
But all I could do were stand there paralyzed

Oh yeah lucky me, I'm singing every day
Ever since that day you came my way
You made my life for me just one big happy game
I'm gay every morning
At night I'm still the same
Do you remember that wonderful time

Lay and laugh in the sun
You can bring, bring your guitar along
We'll sing some songs, we'll have some fun 

The sky is crying and it's time to go home
And we shall hurry to the car from the foam
Sit by the fire and dry out our wet clothes
It's raining outside from the skies up above

Inside it's warm love
And it's ever present everywhere

That were burning

Lay your head upon my pillow
Hold your warm and tender body
Close to mine
Hear the whisper of the rain drops
Blowing soft against the window
And make believe you love me
One more time
For the good times

I'll get along
You'll find another
And I'll be here
If you should find you ever need me
Don't say a word about tomorrow
Or forever

How in the world do you think everybody's 'sposed to respect you?
If you don't give a heck about the man with the Bible in his hand
Just get out of the way and let the gentleman do his thing.
You the kind of gentleman want everything your way.
Take the sheet off your face boy, it's a brand new day.

Cause if you don't respect yourself
Ain't nobody gonna give a good, good hootenanny boy.
Respect yourself.

If you're walking around thinking that the world owes you 
Something 'cause you're here
You're going out the world backward like you did when you first 
Came 'ere.

Put your hand over your mouth when you cough, that'll help the 
Solution.
You cuss around women folk, don't even know their name,

Then walk a mile in my shoes

Throwin' stones at one another

To wear my hat the same way you do
Well, I may be common people
But I'm your brother
And when you strike out
You're tryin' to hurt me
It's hurtin' you, Lord how mercy
Now there are people on reservations
And out in the ghetto
And whether they're for the grace of God

Taxi cabs and busses passin' through the night
The distant moanin' of a train
Seems to play a sad refrain to the night

It still comes out the same
No matter how you look at it, think of it

So I take out my guitar to pass some time
Late at night when it's hard to rest

We'll take it a bit slower
This is, this is the, huh, this is the first song I ever learned, actually 
Frankie and Johnny were sweethearts
Lordy, how they could love

Swore to be true to each other
Yeah, true to the skies above
He was her man, wouldn't do her no wrong 
And Frankie and Johnny went walkin'

And Johnny had on a new suit
Yeah, Frankie spent one-hundred dollar notes
Just to make her man look cute
He was her man, he wouldn't do her no wrong 

Frankie went over to the barroom
Stopped for a bottle of beer
Said to the old bartender man
Has my lover Johnny man been here?

He was my man, Lord, but he'd been doin' me wrong, so wrong. 
Yeah Frankie looked over the transom door
And then to her great surprise
There sat her lover man Johnny

Makin' love to Nellie Bly
He was her man, but he was doin' her wrong 
Well Frankie lifted up her kimono dress
And she drew (ladaladalala) out a little .44 

She shot once, twice, three times (three times) she shot him
And through that hardwood (door) floor
Yeah she shot her man (yeah he was her man)
Well but he been doin' her wrong yeah 

He said, roll me over so careful ah
Roll me over so slow,
Oh roll me on to my left hand side,
Because your bullet hurt me so,

I was your man, but I been doin' you wrong. 
Play it Chris! 
 
Well they sent for Frankie's mother
Come down to Huddy's saloon
To see what's the matter with her boy
She come down, Frankie looked up at her

Here what she said: 
She said, Oh Mrs. Johnson, oh forgive me please
Well I killed your lovin' son, Johnny
But I'm down on my bended knee

I shot your man, 'cause he was doin' me wrong. ah 
She said, I'll forgive you Frankie,
She said, I'll forgive you not, not
For killin' my lovin' son Johnny,

He's the only support that I've got,
'Cause you shot my man and he was doin' you wrong. 
Well the last time I seen Frankie
She was a-sittin' in a dungeon cell

She would be there moanin', herself
With no one there to care
She shot her man, a he'd been doin' her wrong, so wrong 
Well bring out the overtime hearse all day long

You gotta bring out the pony and truck hey
They're gonna take Johnny, Johnny to the cemetery (graveyard)
And they ain't never coming back
Oh he was her man, oh but he been doin' her wrong, so wrong

Y el mensaje que allí mandé yo se quede entre los dos
Aunque mil estén oyendo
Pa' no herir susceptibilidad si ante la sociedad
Usted tiene su dueño
Y sabiendo que me entiende, ya la cordura guardar
Hasta cuando sea bueno
Y cuando la quiera saludar digo una clave que los dos sabemos
Con su segundo nombre puedo hacerlo
Quizás diciendo el color de su pelo
No importa que muchas puedan tenerlo
Pa' que se rían cuando usted se esté riendo
Y si es casó, de acurdo nos ponemos

Ni pecado hacerle sombra a quien no se tiene amor
Pero guardemos siempre los preceptos
Y que el mundo ignore esto es mejor para los dos
Y aunque me esté muriendo por tenerla
Y su actitud me dé la aceptación
No olvide que hay un hijo ya en su senda
Que no merece una frente ni mala reputación

La verdad es que a mí celos me dan
Cuando la veo llegar con su señor marido
Y sé bien que con él esta ya por prejuicio social
queriendo estar conmigo
Sabe Dios que si peco, es quizás
Por querer sin pensar a un amor tan divino
Y por eso él considerará, si es malo entonces hará
Cambiarnos de camino

Our Gang,"I remember Sunday morning
I would meet him at the park
We'd walk together hand in hand
Till it was almost dark
Now I wake up Sunday morning
Walk along the lane to find
Nobody waiting for me
Sunday's just another day

Sunday will never be the same
(Sunday will never be the same)
I lost my baby's heart
I must be back again

Sunny afternoons that made me feel so warm inside
Have turned as cold and gray as ashes
As I feel the embers die
No longer can I walk these paths for they have changed
I must be home the sun is gone and I think it's gonna rain

I remember children
Feeding flocks of pigeons
I remember sunshine and you were mine

That I wonder now
How I ever got this far

So many failures fill my mind
And then history
Keeps reminding me of these scars

Whenever the past is showing me
Where I started from
I'll always look back
And see what He's done, oh

I look back to the cross
Back to the One
To the love that held Him there for us

And back to the place
Where I was set free
Where His arms are wide enough for me

And everything I want
For all I'll ever need
I look back to the cross

So when those days that are sure to come
Leave me down and out
I just think about His great love

Whenever the past is showing me
Where I started from
I'll always look back
And see what He's done, oh

And I look back to the cross
Back to the One
To the love that held Him there for us

Back to the place
Where I was set free
Where His arms are wide enough for me

And everything I want
For all I'll ever need
I look back to the cross

That carried all of my pain
And the love
That covered all of my shame
And I can see

When I look back to the cross
Back to the One
Back to the love that held Him there for us

These warning signs, and the servant grinds, me down
The kids are building fires by their homes
The smoke is sending signals out in code
These safety suits, these parachutes
I don't know

Gotta stop, drop, roll

When all these walls come down
They'll shake us
We fight not to be, not to be weightless
Oh when all these stars hit ground
They'll wake us
We fight not to be, not to be weightless

I'm choking on the words that I cant say
My lungs are full but everything's misplaced
And these junkyard dogs, these cherry bombs, go off
The sun, the sky, the moon will fall apart
Come tumbling down just like a house of cards
These fire escapes, and this lush landscape, it fades

When all these walls come down
They'll shake us
We fight not to be, not to be weightless
Oh when all these stars hit ground
They'll wake us
We fight not to be, not to be weightless
Weightless

I can feel this heavyweight hanging around my neck
I can feel your heartbeat bringing me back
Back again

When all these walls come down
They'll shake us
We fight not to be, not to be weightless
Oh when all these stars hit ground
They'll wake us
We fight not to be, not to be weightless
Be weightless
Be weightless",Heavyweight,2012

I could be the blood on your fingertips

Nothing to regret
Just want to breathe you in

If this is it

I could be your greatest confidant
And I could be the head laying on your breast
Just want to breathe you in

Our Lady Peace,"How do we agree?
How do we exceed?
Places that our lives have taken
Sharpened instruments
Failed experiments
Faces of the occupation

Boxing helps. I guess, I think it toughens your mind
I think you push yourself beyond certain limits, past
The worst thing in the world is to be in a fight and to get tired
You don't want to get tired in a fight

Say that you can show me
You don't know me
You want to live oh
Say that you can own me
You think you know me but you're wrong

No matter how much natural ability you have 
There's a lot of working at it
You know, you don't need, Muhammad Ali was a great fighter 
But if he didn't train as hard as he did, he
You'd never hear the name Muhammad Ali become
You have to train hard
You have to devote yourself one hundred percent

You can't be a success if you don't have any part of it
Like if you don't have discipline. You need discipline
You need discipline to do things
And the discipline is you do it without things, you know?

No matter if we say we believe this, we believe that
You know there's certain things we believe
But just how strongly we believe is a matter, you know
It's what we want to believe
A force much stronger than us, a power
A power much more powerful, you know? But we still don't know
No matter how much we think we believe
We still tremor at the thought of dying
We shiver almost died, you know?
There's something out there
But just to me it's like the great unknown. You know? I don't know.

One of the most important things in life 
Is to have people who care about you, and you care about
You know Love is the magic word, it is, you know? 
If it wasn't for love I wouldn't be here today",Mettle,2012

But then I have a question, is that what we're living for?
Aren't we called to perfection, to strive for so much more
I find that we have settled too many times
Should not be so, I think it's time God's letting us know

We need to step in the light,
And find out what we're livin' for

It doesn't end in choosin', because in all we do
We're called to keep on goin', pressin' on just to remain true

The love of God it flows deeper than an ocean
Lookin' for love you know that I can show you
Cause what I got goes on and on and on
Your heart is broken and you're wondering
What you can do to ease the hurt and pain you feel
You're letting these no ones get in closer
Than they need to cause you're looking for love
Oh, I got a feeling no one's told you
No one's bothered at all to give you what you need
So you're out searchin' for something to hold on to
But you don't know it's right there if you'd only see
On your own now, doing your own thing
Say you don't need nobody's help to make it through
(But you're really wasting your time) you're still lonely
(And you know that you're gonna find) that you're only
Left more empty than you were before, oh but I'm telling you
Oh you don't have to look around
Let me tell you 'bout the love that I have found
Everything that our heart needs, it's just right here
Right here waiting
Oh you don't have to look no more
Real love is knocking on your door
Everything that your soul needs, it's just right here,
Right here waiting for you
[Bridge:]
Oh my friend I'm telling you, I've been there myself a time or two
When I was just running round, to find a place for my heart that 
Was beaten down
There's something you need to see, the One who made you
Love's you please believe
He's all you need to get by, you know you're somebody so tell me why you're...

Out of Eden,"[Rap by Knowdaverbs:]
I remember begging my mom for these Z. Cavarricci's
With a striped genera shirt just to rock with these brutini's
I begged and I begged, of course she said no
So I committed to cutting grass just to conjour up the dough
With a little extra change I'll cut a slope and a fade
I'll be the freshest of the men in the midst of ninth grade
It's crazy how we place these small things as important
While the monument's reminding us of washed up Jordan's
Rivers that is, not the be	-ball player, told the mountains to
Move and now there's no more Himalayas
Had to set the devil straight since he was highly overrated
Spoke and mountains moved and then the Alps disintegrated
Racing through the fire I perspire like He times me
And cross the finish line to realize that He's refined me
Can't wait for morning breaks as joy turns from sorrow
Busting victory laps around mount Kilimajarro
Oh, we've made it this far and there's no turning back now
With all of the joy deep inside
We'll be praising His name, clapping hands while we're singing
And dancing 'til the morning light, that's right, that's right
Weight upon my shoulders, held a burden and they thought
I'd never make it over, so I had to prove them wrong
I never stopped believing, not a doubt in my mind
The blessings I'm receiving, have cast the fears aside, yeah
Wasn't easy, I got to let you know, had a lot to overcome
But He loves me, he showed me the way to go
Feels like life has just begun

[Rap by Coffee:]
I'm a scream from the rooftops, freckled face figment, light
Complected pigment, least expected remnant, over flooding
Supercharged enlarged freshly gutted, surgically removed was
The flesh Jesus cut it. Was allotted when I got it, most
Happiest, most joyful, vibrant, vibrating, dance around
Illustrating. My matrix, a labyrinth, a maze, a holographic image,
No end to my phonographic limits. If you've seen it once you've seen
It twice, propelling, stopping swelling by applying bags of ice
I'm open, before receiving Christ in darkness groping, Proverbs 4
The focus of the diagnosis spoken made the decision to collision
With incision self division multiplying and relying, sinful dying
Cling to vision thank God in all I do, uh-uh, thank God in all I do
Can't entrap me and I'm happy born anew
Won't be easy, I've got to let you know
There's a lot to overcome
But He loves you, He'll show you the way to go
You will feel like life has just begun

[Rap by Bonified:]
I got to keep moving and never carry the weight
Trying to do it myself instead of walking in faith
Leaving the rest to Him, giving my best to Him
And put my flesh to death without a breath to take
Had to battle the beats and overcame defeat
Another factor of the seven from the garden of Eden
Bonafied a true survivor of the wilderness
Blessed beyond I gotta move on I gotta move on

Now's your chance to be totally set free
If you're in the groove
And you know God is seeing you through
Better make your move",No Turning Back,1999
Out of Eden,"I can see that you are lost; I've come to find you.
Even though you chose to leave and go your way.
You thought you'd find more than what I could give you.
So I let you go, still I want you to know.
I've seen you struggle, I've seen you crying.
Seen you do those things you swore you would never do.
Oh, your guilty soul has got you slowly dying.
What your running from, you should run to.

Chorus:
Open up your heart to me
and I will set you free.
Open up your eyes and see
I'm everything you need.
Open up your mind and know

It won't be hard for you to believe
if you open up your heart to me.

You turn here and there for the things to make you happy.
You're on a high, but then you crash when those things tear you apart,yeah your broken heart.
Your broken heart needs my love that's real
and you will find
a touch from heaven is what will heal.
That touch is mine;
you can start again if you will open....

fail you, you will find

Sometimes life it seems a bit too much for me
More things we must survive on top of all that we had before
Broken hearts, broken homes, kids abused left alone
So many in the streets, homeless with no food to eat
(I know God hears us crying out)
Run to Him for all the answers, don't turn away
(If we look to Him there is no doubt)
He'll give us all the help we need, he knows the way, still if I

If I had a dollar for every heart that's broken
For every word of love unspoken
For every childhood dream that's never realize
If I had a penny for all the wrong we're doing
And all the ways we could be moving on
Maybe I could buy you paradise
Just to see some hope in your eyes

There are so many troubles, God knows what we need to do
He has us in His hands, knows what we are going through
Silver and gold have I none, what I have I give to you
His word says we can make it and I know His word is true
Here's to the hurting souls and for all the broken hearts
All those who've been abused, who's life has been torn apart
I don't have all the answers, what I have I gladly give
It's in him there is life, if in him we live and if I

If I had a dollar for every heart that's broken
For every word of love unspoken
For every childhood dream that's never realize
If I had a penny for all the wrong we're doing
And all the ways we could be moving on
Maybe I could buy you paradise
Just to see some hope in your eyes",Paradise,2002
Out of Eden,"Lord,I really don't know how to write a song.
I'm not always eloquent, sometimes I get it wrong.
But the thing you're doing in me, I can't describe.
What a fool I'd be if I chose to hide
this transformation, new motivation.
Thought that we were close; I've known you all this time.
But I was just living life my way, just getting by.
Thought that if I do a good deed or two,
that'd be enough to please you.
I kept the parts I wanted to,
and missed out on the real you.

[Chorus]
Now, with every step and every breath,
I give it all; hold nothing back.
With all I am, this is my choice
to live to worship you.
So, with all my heart, my soul, my mind;
I'll love you, leave it all behind.
To live my life in awe of you
is the least that I can do.

I've held on so long to all my hopes and dreams.
While you were asking me to place them all at your feet.
Let my praise be more than a song I'll sing for you.
Let me change all my ways in response to you.
I've lived for myself, Lord, I need your help.
Not I who lives, but You.

[Chorus]

For you are worthy of all honor.
(and you) deserve the sacrifice I'll give.
You've touched my heart, and now I see
what it is you want from me.
So I'll lose the things that hold me back,
so you can set me free.

[Chorus]",Praise You,2002
Out of Eden,"Sittin' on the front porch, waitin' for you to come home
Visions of reuniting in my head
Only bitter-sweet memories, no holidays, no Christmas trees
Broken promises I have instead
How I used to wonder where did I go wrong, how you could've stayed away so long
That God for my mother hers was no easy song
Thank God that He showed me, how to get along

My papa was a rolling stone, abandoned us & left us lone
And how it broke my heart and home & had me losin' faith
Somebody saw what I went through and understood, had been there too
So glad they introduced me to, my Father
Your story sounds a lot like mine, it's a story told a thousand times
Someone hurting leaves in dis-array

But don't you know that God made you, more valuable than they ever knew
You know you can live past their mistakes
How you sit and wonder, how could all this be, someone that you loved so much
Just turn their backs and leave
Oh You need the lover of your soul and He is able to take care of you
Find He will never leave
Your papa was a rolling stone, abandoned you and left you lone

And how it broke your heart and home and has you losing faith
I'm seein' what you've going through: I understand, I've been there too
So let me introduce you to my Father
No longer, solid ground under my feet
I know what my life is worth, no longer incomplete
I just want to tell you, you are really loved
The maker of heaven, the maker of earth
You know He's got His hands on you and that is more than enough",Rolling Stone,2002
Out of Eden,"Yo, I don't appreciate you telling me
The way that I should live
No, I think the choices you've laid out for me
The end is negative

So, take all your imagery and ideology
Yes I'll be fine
When you go I'd rather not display my physical
I'd rather use my mind, oh

You act like all I am to be is, just a sexy, sexy thing
Just a showpiece for all to see like a Bently or your diamond ring
I know that I am more than that, don't believe the hype
The One who made the stars and sun gave meaning to my life

Oh, I don't need you to define my be-E-A-you-T-why
I'd rather draw the line
Oh, I don't need you on my team, what you're selling's a pipe dream
And I don't need it, baby

Hey, it seems a shame to me I've been reduced
To an object of lust and hate
No way, please understand that I refuse to be
Simply a height and weight

This day, somewhere we've lost the value
Of what a woman is supposed to be
A queen, respected and defined by her creator
Size 24, size 10 or size 3

You act like all I am to be is, just a sexy, sexy thing
Just a showpiece for all to see like a Bently or your diamond ring
I know that I am more than that, don't believe the hype
The One who made the stars and sun gave meaning to my life

Oh, I don't need you to define my be-E-A-you-T-why
I'd rather draw the line
Oh, I don't need you on my team, what you're selling's a pipe dream
And I don't need it, baby

It's my choice and I will decide, I won't let you destroy my pride
I'm no showpiece for you to hide and lose all that I am inside
God made me and I'm beautiful, I won't dress like that kind of girl
Are-E-S-P-E-see-T, see, that's the way that you got to look at me

It's my choice and I will decide, I won't let you destroy my pride
I'm no showpiece for you to hide and lose all that I am inside
God made me and I'm beautiful, I won't dress like that kind of girl
Are-E-S-P-E-see-T, see, that's the way that you got to look at me

Out of Eden,"Why you sittin' at home, waiting for the phone to ring
Waiting for someone to hand your dreams to you
You know you got to keep it movin'
If you don't get up then you'll be losin'
Don't deny, do you think it's gonna fall out the sky
Nothing's really happenin' and you're wondering why
How are you going to make it if you never try
Nobody said it was gonna be easy, but you gotta do what you gotta do
Put on your best foot and step forward knowin' that God will see you through
So when you get tired and you feel a little faint
Know somebody's watchin' you and will help you on your way

God knows what it's meant to be
Know you've got a destiny, time is now so won't you see
This is your life
No more waiting to begin, take your chance & know you'll win
You can make it in this thing called life
Somebody said you'll never make it & that's the thought you're keeping
Don't let that be the reason why you're sleepin'
Time is of the essence & you better believe, that you can do anything
So get up, get up, follow your dreams
Don't you dare give up, no matter how hard it seems
You only get it once, getting by is not enough
So take a chance and live this life
Hey yeah, get up now
Hey yeah

Above thy deep and dreamless sleep the silent stars go by
Yet in thy dark streets shineth, the everlasting light
The hopes and fears of all the years are met in thee tonight.

For Christ is born of Mary, and gathered all above
While mortals sleep the angels keep their watch of wondering love
Oh morning stars together, proclaim thy holy birth.
And praises sing to God the king, and peace to men on earth.

Out of Eden,"1. Be still, my soul; the Lord is on thy side;
Bear patiently the cross of grief or pain;
Leave to thy God to order and provide;
In every change He faithful will remain.
Be still, my soul; thy best, thy heavenly, Friend
Through thorny ways leads to a joyful end.

2. Be still, my soul; thy God doth undertake
To guide the future as He has the past.
Thy hope, thy confidence, let nothing shake;
All now mysterious shall be bright at last.
Be still, my soul; the waves and winds still know
His voice who ruled them while He dwelt below.

3. Be still, my soul, though dearest friends depart
And all is darkened in the vale of tears;
Then shalt thou better know His love, His heart,
Who comes to soothe thy sorrows and thy fears.
Be still, my soul; thy Jesus can repay
From His own fulness all He takes away.

4. Be still, my soul; the hour is hastening on
When we shall be forever with the Lord,
When disappointment, grief, and fear are gone,
Sorrow forgot, love's purest joys restored.
Be still, my soul; when change and tears are past,
All safe and blessed we shall meet at last.

Out of Eden,"Forgive me, Lord, for I have sinned
I have strayed from your ways
I need to begin again
My ways have let me down

Won't you please turn my life around?
I can't make it on my own
I will do what you say, Lord, have your way
And hear my prayer this day

I need you, Lord, please hear my cry
Take this heart as your own
And make it clean inside
Wash me in your precious blood

Wrap me in your open arm of love
So, I know you've not given up
I will do what you say, Lord, have your way
And hear my prayer this day

Oh, have mercy, oh, have mercy
Lord, I need you, I am not giving up
I'm not letting go, not even getting off of my knees
'Til I hear a word from you

Be near me, Lord
I've turned from my wrongs
I am following you, won't you speak?
Help me carry on

For just one word from you
Gives me the strength to make it through
Don't leave me here on my own

Oh, have mercy, oh, have mercy
Lord, I need you, I am not giving up
I'm not letting go, not even getting off of my knees

I need a word from you, so won't you speak to my soul?
Tell me how to live and tell me which way to go
I put my trust in you and I will stay in your word
You gave it to me so I can walk right, I promise to do what I've heard

So, speak to my heart, Lord and give me your Holy Word
If I can't hear from you, well, I don't know what to do
If I should fall, if I should stray, I promise I won't wait
To get down on my knees and beg you please

You've forgiven my sins and I want to honor you
So, Lord, please take your place
As my master, Lord, I'll seek your face

I will not leave your side
I will do what you say, Lord, have your way
I will do what you say, Lord, have your way
I will do what you say, Lord, have your way

Out of Nowhere,"A hopeless romantic, self-medicated on reality;
A misunderstanding is all that anyone can see in me

Pulling up the floor to go deeper down
Tearing at the soil to find the ground

I’m trying to find myself
Coming back to the same words to try to tell a different story
I’m farther from myself
Coming back to the same words, in hope they come alive without me

A moment’s reflection has given me a second chance to heal;
A loss of connection in matching up my words to how I feel

I’ve taken on too much, empty pages on the floor
Tearing volumes from the shelf to find what I’ve been looking for
Then it hit me

Well, I haven’t changed. I’m still the same man I was before
Well, I haven’t changed, I’m still the same man I was, just trying to find myself…

I’m trying to find myself, coming back to the same words
I’m farther from myself, coming back to the same words",New Romantics,2007

In which we live in
Makes you give in and cry

You got to give the other fella hell
