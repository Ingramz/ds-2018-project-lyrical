Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!
Fuck why y'all niggas talking 'bout huh? (it's time I see you)
Get it right, you fagot niggas heard Suge Knight
Double are's the only niggas he respect and, why y'all niggas shook right?
Why y'all get on Hot 97 and, talk wit a baritone
Wit two niggas downstairs with licensed guns to take why y'all home
Scared ass niggas, you think they going take a life so they can get life [nope]
Ask Puff they ain't trying to hear that nigga
For no cake, and why y'all can get at us on Labor Day
We make stones that say ? your moms labor day
I'm in the hood so we can link up, any place you think of
Hand held don't hold prints plus I burnt the tip of my fingers
I'm a Bronx gangsta nigga, double are's hoodrat
The nigga they come get quick bitch, on this hood shit

[Cross]
Why y'all bitches think the riders a joke, well I don't play (let's go)
I blow you whole fucking shit up like Tim McVeigh
Gimme the needle, not tomorrow, but today
Cross coming why y'all better get the fuck out the way
I ain't the shit that you see that's on the top of your church
I put a bomb in your baby carriage, brick through your hearse

[Infa-Red]
Tell your CEO, don't call my CEO apologizing (sorry)
I'm at your wake in the choir standing harmonizing
It's Infa-Red the shit that be on top of the heater
The best thing in New York since Steinbrenner signed Jeter
Hold Camby sister the hostage, then send 'em a reef
So stop fronting vegetarian just scared of beef

[Eve]
Yo, hey suck my dick bitch, the way this chick spit ridiculous
Here we go again, only we on Kiss shit
We coming and you keep running
You keep claiming you the best that done it
Pussy let me see something
Fake niggas screaming ""Ryde or Die""
Same niggas we run up on and make 'em cry
Outta all the camps in this game, nigga
We the champs in this game
Who kick the real shit before the fame
Fuck you fat ass, fake bad ass niggas
Still play the hood while you ride past niggas
Coward trust me, we keep it gutter
Hope you stay mad a hater 'cause you can't touch us, huh

""It's time I see you""

[Styles]
Hey yo, I ain't got a care in the world
Kidnapping your kid, maiming your mom, and airing your girl
And like, you ain't got a care in the world
I'm hopeless and numb, I can't see but I can focus my gun
And I'm down for smoking blunts to the head
My nerves is shot, my paces is short, I dump in your head
I'm the hardest nigga out you outta know it by now
I'm the nigga that they talk about going to Chao
And my name ring bells, my blade stay bloody
If you heard about me beefing dog I leave the most shells
The nigga to salute, the quickest to shoot
Holiday Styles, motherfucker, giving you pound

[Sheek]
What? Like I won't run up and break your jaw
Like they make a vest for your head to stop the 4
I'm tired of rapping, let's get the mack and send niggas on vacation
Right in front of the radio station
Motherfuckers ain't quiet til the tech go off
Arteries hitted, hawkin, they neck is shit
I'm the motherfucking hardest
I smack the shit out of any one of your artists
Whatever the label
Why y'all niggas don't want beef, why y'all want meat at the table
And I don't give a fuck, Sheek'll do life in the box
Before any of why y'all bitch niggas front on the LOX
What? Motherfuckers, see man

[Jadakiss]
Yo, If I miss your head and your neck, I'll hurt your chest
If you from the streets betrayal is worse than death
And I'm known for getting money, not known for wildin
But I'm real I could rock both phones in the island
This is how we even the bets
I kill everything you love dog, right now, even the pets
Everything got dubs on it, even the vets
50 close, then 50 wide, even the sets
Cause the bullets is like calisthenics when I'm squirting
When they start hurting, that means they working
Only way we coming is hard
Industry is like jail nigga, double are's running the yard, uh",It's Time I See You,2001
Infrared,"Fabolous, Funk Flex Vol. 4 niggas see'mon
It's gettin' hard to dodge the women
But I'm still pitching hard white balls
Faster than Roger Clemens,
Ya know the kid with the O's
That's as large as linens
When it comes to sellin' trees
I'm as large as Timberland
My lawyer got my charges slimmin'
He said the only way I am goin upstate
If it's in larger swimmin'
Pull out the garage like gremlins
Anarge with trimmins
System in it that have the projects tremblin'
Ya know nothin' about lettin' a few strays go off
Ya only reach for your hip when your two ways go off
Shots'll fly by your head
Your toup blow off
I ain't crip I'm just a blue gray show off
Ghetto fab I more than rap for my bucks
Keep two 9's on me like Warren Sapp from the Buccs
The word I'm ballin' be flowin' to the fed Jakes
And I keep chicks on my lap throwin' me head fakes
Nigga I walk around with the grams you stackin'
And me and Flex don't roll unless they Andrew Jackson

Infusion,"I've been burning these same boards 
Getting bored and restless
I've got itchy feet
I'm gonna hit the dance floor
Gonna pave the way for a new and better me than I was today
Gonna laugh in face of death
Jump off a cliff like a fool 
Too busy staring at the sun but it's fun to be someone else for a change of heart
Of mind of body and soul in time to the pulse of your blood and breath in the neck of the world and all that mother nature can hold and give and love and feel
Don't you get my drift
Did you get the pack
Did you get the set 
Did you get the joke
Did you get the outcome
My stuff's bigger than your stuff 
Sit back down
Try get your head together
Optimist, did you read that eye towers seizing every second more so every second burning bright lighting the road ahead stepping down the path of many feared
A tread beam lead by the higher mind who will find
That sometimes its best to leave the past behind 
Why cry at the moon for what was lost
Too soon the things you didn't do all the forgotten tunes
You gotta remember that everything you own ain't everything you are
This is the third trip in the back of your car filled with memories flashing by like liquid sky
Like electric stars that define everything that we are
I'm getting hypnotized
I've come too far, I was trying too hard now everything keeps shifting in and out of time

Lets venture forth into the unknown
Heads bursting with light blazing through the uncharted streets write our names
Fifty feet high in the minds of all the people we meet
Draw a Halo around your head where god looks down and blesses the genetics of red roof tiles, golden gates, emerald isles and the lands where the sun is slowly rising

Let's dance tonight beneath the Milky Way
Some won't make it back but that's ok
This is a moment that can't be missed so it's worth the risk
Touching the bullets of a silicone century 
Nothing now can sully the sound of a drummers beating 
The humidity from the sky
For the love
For the beat of the rush of future is ours
Its coming
The future is bright.

Inga Rumpf,"(James Brown sample) ""This is a Man's World!""

Verse 1:
Lies and rumors, money and hoes
it's the World that I'm attached to, the World that I know
influential, never stable in the mental
but clever, spittin' that same shit niggas is into
I'll bleed for the craft if I have to, think rational
lovin' money and weed, pussy and fast food
tatoo a dead Man's name on my arm
I'm a thug in the street that's still afraid of his Moms
everyday I watch a player get robbed, player get popped
I try to drink the pain away and pray that it stops
in the mornin' head straight to the spot, the juice bar
niggas tried all that other shit and what's the use God?
for the paper Nature takes it too far, perfectionist
rep the bridge, where everything's foul except the kids
we get it on, and contradict livin' long
though the clock will still tic when you gone.

Chorus
(This is a Man's World!)
Now if you a Man be a Man (you need a plan)
if you fall (I'ma put you on your feet again)
when you starve (I'ma show you how to eat again)
and through it all (I'll show you how to be a friend)
now when you in charge be in charge (you need a squad)
if you bored (I'ma show you how to be involved)
I give 'em more (niggas know they can't see the God)
I can't believe it God (I gotta eat or starve)

Verse 2:
Keep the livest image, high percentage
Four in the mornin', 
niggas blitzin' on corners like the line of scrimmage
convicts turnin' confident
enter the phase of niggas and they feminine ways
love my Timberlands, cinnamon suede
bottles mo' proof
for all the problems that a nigga go through
it's forever real 
'cause some scars can never heal
I'd rather throw the cards in and pray I get a better deal
guns excite me, keep atleast a hundred Wifey's
my duns up in the pens ya'll need to write me
street cadets, alias names and re-arrests
it doesn't take much to know that wrieffer helps relieve the stress
we make moves or get caught for the loot
wild niggas on the block look for more to recruit
gettin' chips from an alternate route 
but the same breed
It's been Twenty-somethin' years now,
I'm still lookin' for the same dream.

Chorus

Verse 3:
In my World police recognize names
know us niggas by the walk or the size of their chain
you know the motto
we live for today, there's no tomorrow
we're only makin' time for the hoes that swallow
fuck a role model, I need therapy
seven nights out the week I jump out my sleep breathin' heavily
keep my head up, only the strong survive
livin' in a Man's World, still belongs to a tribe
took the family along for the ride
watch 'em eat
now I'm movin' with the same cats that'll rock me to sleep
never close your eyes, learn to roll with the wise
'cause some niggas 'll talk shit and play close to the sides
while I call the shots 
and stay supportin' the block
we livin' above the law until all of it stops
I still open doors, a thug nigga overall
and if you ain't know then black Man go for yours.

Inga Rumpf,"Bonnie and Clyde were pretty lookin' people
But I can tell you people They were the devil's children,
Bonnie and Clyde began their evil doin'
One lazy afternoon down Savannah way,

They robbed a store, and high-tailed outa that town
Got clean away in a stolen car,
And waited till the heat died down,
Bonnie and Clyde advanced their reputation

And made the graduation
Into the banking business.

As Bonnie loaded dollars in the dewlap bag,

Now one brave man-he tried to take 'em alone
They left him Iyin' in a pool of blood,
And laughed about it all the way home.
Bonnie and Clyde got to be public enemy number one

Running and hiding from ev'ry American lawman's gun.
They used to laugh about dyin',
But deep inside 'em they knew
That pretty soon they'd be lyin'

Beneath the ground together
Pushing up daisies to welcome the sun
And the morning dew.

Inger Marie Gundersen,"You don't know what love is
'Til you've learned the meaning of the blues
Until you've loved a love you've had  to lose,
You don't know what love  is.

You don't know how lips hurt
Until you've kissed and had to pay the cost,
Until you've flipped your heart and you have lost,
You don't know what love is.

Do you know how a lost heart fears
At the thought of reminiscing,
And how lips that taste of tears
Lose their taste for kissing?
You don't know how hearts burn
For love that can, not live yet never dies.
Until you've faced each dawn with sleepless eyes,
You don't know what love is.",You Don't Know What Love Is,2007

The thunder and lightning
Seem to be having their way.

The turn in the weather
Will keep us together
So I can honestly say,
That as far as I'm concerned, it's a lovely day
And everything's okay.

Isn't this a lovely day to be caught in the rain.
You were going on your way, now you've got to remain.

Just as you were going, leaving me all at sea,
The clouds broke, they broke and oh what a break for me.

I can see the sun up high, though we're caught in a storm.
I can see where you and I could be cozy and warm.

But it really doesn't matter 
If the skies are gray.
Long as I can be with you, it's a lovely day.",Isn't This a Lovely Day?,1989

Restless wind inside a letter box
They tumble blindly as they make their way across the universe.

Shines around me like a million suns,
It calls me on and on across the universe

When I heard my child in prayer.
She said, ""And for me some scarlet ribbons,
Scarlet ribbons for my hair."" 

All the stores were closed and shuttered,
And all the streets were dark and bare. 
In our town, no scarlet ribbons, 
Not one ribbon for her hair. 

Through the night my heart was aching. 
And just before the dawn was breaking, 
I peeked in and on her bed, 
In gay profusion lying there, 
Lovely ribbons, scarlet ribbons. 
Scarlet ribbons for her hair. 

If I live to be a hundred, 
I will never, never know from where, 
Came those lovely scarlet ribbons, 
Scarlet Ribbons for her hair.

I looked out this morning and the sun was gone

Turned on some music to start my day

I lost myself in a familiar song

I closed my eyes and I slipped away


It's more than a feeling, when I hear that old song they used to play

(more than a feeling)

I begin dreaming (more than a feeling)

'till I see Marianne walk away

I see my Marianne walkin' away


So many people have come and gone

Their faces fade as the years go by

Yet I still recall as I wander on

as clear as the sun in the summer sky


It's more than a feeling, when I hear that old song they used to play

(more than a feeling)

I begin dreaming (more than a feeling)

'till I see Marianne walk away

I see my Marianne walkin' away


When I'm tired and thinking cold

I hide in my music, forget the day

and dream of a girl I used to know

I closed my eyes and she slipped away

She slipped away She slipped away.


It's more than a feeling, when I hear that old song they used to play

(more than a feeling)

I begin dreaming (more than a feeling)

'till I see Marianne walk away

I see my Marianne walkin' away

& now I know I'll never see a day
When you're not on my mind, not on my mind

I want the old you & me
I wanna show so they can see
That any pain can be healed in time, be healed in time

call it my way
I'm not afraid to let you sleep by yourself
No change today
& I'll never know what stops me, but if I
Call it your way
Then I'll hold you, hold my love

but I'm

I find now I can resist
I know it's hard to not love you
But soon I'll be fine, soon I'll be fine
I want it how it used to be
I want the old you & me
I wanna show so they can see
That any pain can be healed in time, be healed in time

call it my way
I'm not afraid to let you sleep by yourself
No change today
& I'll never know what stops me, but if I
Call it your way
Then I'll hold you, hold my love

but I've
I've let out that I want out
But wait
You'll find out we'll work out this way

I had my eyes shut, was dreamin' 'bout the past
I thought about you while the radio played
I should've got a-movin', some reason I stayed

I started driftin' to a different place
I realized was fallin' off the face of the your world
There was nothin' left to bring me back

I'm a million miles away, a million miles away
I'm a million miles away
There was nothin' left to bring me back today, today

The streets are empty, there's no one around
And all the faces that we used to know
Gone from the places we used to go

I just can't sing to any man the song he wants to hear
And I know that some won't like me
Others try to be my friend
But I'm all of me, and that's all that I am

And if life is for the living
Then why can't men be real
'Stead of hidin' in their costumes
Forgettin' how to feel, forgettin' how to feel

We still live in a time when manners cover what is real
There's a basic fact of life that the times cannot conceal
That if some are masqueraders
Others live in their facade
But I'm what I am
I cannot be what I am not

And if life is for the living
Then why can't men be real
'Stead of hidin' in their costumes
Forgettin' how to feel, forgettin' how to feel

I may be too honest and offend those who pretend
I don't claim I'm always right, that I'm ev'rybody's friend
Perhaps for them it's easier to be what they are not
But I'm what I am, and I just can't play that part

Told the tale to me

Sure, a little bit of heaven fell
From out the sky one day
And it nestled on the ocean
In a spot so far away

And when the angels found it
Sure, it looked so sweet and fair
They said, ""Suppose we leave it
For it looks so peaceful there""

So they sprinkled it with stardust
Just to make the shamrocks grow

Old black magic that you weave so well 
Those icy fingers up and down my spine
The same old witch craft when your eyes meet mine
Same old tingle that I feel inside
Then the elevator starts it ride

Down and down I go
Round and round I go
Like a leaf caught in a tide
I should stay away but what can I do 
I hear your name and I'm a flame

Flame, flame of desire 
Only your kiss can put out the fire 
Oh you're the lover I have waiting for 
Your the mate that fate had me created for 
And every time your lips meet mine

Down and down I go

Ingrid Lucia & the Flying Neutrinos,"Do you know what it means to miss New Orleans
And miss it each night and day
I know I'm not wrong, the feeling's getting stronger 
The longer I stay away

Miss the moss-covered vines, tall sugar pines
Where mockingbirds used to sing
I'd love to see that old lazy Mississippi
Hurrying into Spring

The moonlight on the bayou
A Creole tune that fills the air
I dream about magnolias in bloom
And I'm wishin' I was there

When that's where you left your heart
And there's one thing more, I miss the one I care for
More than I miss New Orleans",Do You Know What It Means to Miss New Orleans?,2007

Though the days are long
Twilight sings a song
Of a happiness that used to be

Soon my eyes will close
(Soon my eyes will close)
Soon I'll find repose
And in dreams, you're always near to me

I'll see you in my dreams
Hold you in my dreams
Someone took you out of my arms
Still, I feel the thrill of your charms

Lips that once were mine
Tender eyes that shine
They will light our way tonight
I'll see you in my dreams

In the dreary gray
Of another day
You are far away and I am blue

Still I hope and pray
(Still I hope and pray)
Through each weary day
For it brings the night and dreams of you

I'll see you in my dreams
Hold you in my dreams
Someone took you out of my arms
Still, I feel the thrill of your charms

Bury me in your quiet love
And we will blow away",Snowfall [#],2008

It rolls in from the sea

My voice; a beacon in the night.
My words will be your light,
To carry you to me.

Beneath the winter snow,
Or so I have been told.

They say were buried far,
Just like a distant star
I simply cannot hold.

Climbing up walls that I never knew were there

Ingrid Michaelson,"I knew a man who was afraid to love
To lay his heart on the bathroom rug
He drank his coffee in the same old mug
And sat in silence 'til the world fell numb

Until the day when a girl came by
She had eyes like the rising tide
He felt a sharpness deep inside
The kind of ache that can't be satisfied

We hate the rain when it fills up our shoes
But how we love when it washes our cars
And we love to love when it fills up the room
But when it leaves oh we're cursing the stars (Ooh)

So he turned to the radio
And he went to a picture show
Tried to find someone else who knows
All the hurt that a heart can hold

She smelled like cinnamon and winter clove
And sparked like firewood inside a stove
Wanted to ask her just to sit and stay
Instead he watched as she walked away

We hate the rain when it fills up our shoes
But how we love when it washes our cars
We love to love when it fills up the room
But when it leaves oh we're cursing the stars

Ooh ooh

Why don't you come back home?

And when I see the curve of the earth in your willow eyes
I'm a rocketeer, coming home after years at the speed of light
Suddenly you're there, like a pearl in the palm of the universe
Your unlikely skies filling up my eyes
You come as some surprise,

Who lives who dies who tells your story

My mind flashes, I see the asses of the masters
Who test the masses, I ask if I'll ever be one
When I die, will heaven be done?
What will my legend become?
I will forever be young
Through old tales of breakdancing down at Odell's
Streets named after me is where my soul dwells
Desires of a church choir, Trinity United
I think of good memories that Hennessy provided

Memories divided by perception
Will it be water for chocolate or resurrection?
The path to perfection is rarely achieved
I head in that direction, I dream and believe
An underground dude that overachieve
From the windy city I was blowing they eaves
Somewhere along the way I aired out MCs (who lives who dies who tells your story)

And who dies
Who holds on to all our lives
Time and time and time again
Will they tell your story in the end
(Who lives who dies who tells your story?)

Yo, the anticipation arose as time froze
The black men in the morgue were John Does
Lynched for whistling at blond-oes
I said a prayer with my eyes closed
As I loaded the roscoe's at the sink, yo
I been a bullet on the brink
But being a young king
Probably different than you think, though
The quills that I dip into the ink go to document
And you'll remember me when I'm extinct

Yo, sing the carol at a young pharaoh
Who slew Leviathan with one arrow
As I revolve through the gun barrel just to watch it unravel
I tell them have heart, must travel
Keep my legacy alive even if I don't survive 'til the curtain call
First of all, realize what we working towards
Fuck around, find what we searching for (who lives who dies who tells your story?)
The earth, my name written in cursive on

Nat Cole, Unforgettable
The pedestal I'm on, I'mma end up on the Federal
Reserve note your money with a hip hop quote
I might change legislation with some shit that I wrote
From boats that we came on to lights with our name on
Through hard times, we spark minds to keep the flame on
I write hard rhymes like I'm running out of time
Truthfully, my stop watch is one with the divine
Centuries from now, they'll play my freestyle
And say, this is the brilliance of a Black American child
Endowed by the streets of the Chi proud
Known to move in silence, but can be loud
The noise of beat girls and boys
Building to destroy the perception of urban aggression
My life is a progression, of course for the oppressors
A chorus, my story is the glory of the lord

Had no intention to do the things we've done
Funny how it always goes with love, when you don't look, you find
But then we're two of a kind, we move as one

Ingrid Pitt,"""Mirror, mirror on the wall
Shouldst not grave pleasures be my all?
For if I shall see thy Will be done
Grant Me the Witchcraft of thy tongue""

Three moondials froze in the shadow of six
As another soul passed to the grasping Styx
Clutching their trinket crucifix
Bats blew from caves in a dissonant surge
Omens of corruption from within the church
A fetid, dank oasis still clung to fool rebirth

Alone as a stone cold altar
The castle and its keep
Like faerytale dominion rose
A widow to the snow peaks
Wherein reclined the Countess
Limbs purring from the kill
Bathed in virgin white and like the night
Alive and young and unfulfilled

Was it the cry of a wolf
That broke the silver thread of enchanted thoughts?
Of Her life as a mere reflection
(As the moon's in narrow windows caught)
That opened like dark eyelids on
The sigh of the woods that the wind fell upon

Like a Siren weaving song
From the lilt of choirs choking
Where the vengeful dead
Belong...

To the Sorceress and Her charnel arts
She swept from ebon towers at the hour of Mars
'Neath a star-inwoven sky latticed by scars
To unbind knotted reins that kept in canter, despair
Shod on melancholy, fleet to sanctuary there,
In netherglades tethered where onyx idols stared

Was it the Kiss of the mist
That peopled the air with the prowess of absinthe?
Lost souls begging resurrection
From Gods upon their forest plinths
Whose epitaphs read of re-ascending to win
Remission from despair through a holocaust of sin

In a tongue hilted in invective rectums
Over signs and seals the sorceress prayed
To Death, to rend the slender veil
That Ancient Ones might rise again

As shadows swelled
The Countess fell
To masturbating with Her dagger
As the Witch gabbled spells
Cumming heavy roses all the way to Hell
As sudden thunder's grue harangue
Announced two pincered worlds

Exuding bane, something came
With the stench of necrophiled graves
To these clandestines
Who shrank from glimpsing horror
That the growls of mating houls inclined...

Resplendent
In pendants
(Natal trophies torn from bellies of desanctified nuns)
A demons, bewinged, bedight
In scum, prowled their circle seeking entry to run
An arctic tongue upon Her vulva
Where rubies smeared to alabaster thighs
Glittered like a contract in the purse of a whore
Receiving sole communion from the body of christ

""If blood is what thou carves, foul fiend
I will yield this witch to thee
If thou wouldst draw a veil for Me
O'er lengthening scars of age and grief""

As the Demon slavered foetid vows
And bore His prey away
In talons itching to perpetrate
The nausea of eternal rape
The Sorceress screaming in His grasp
Spat a final curse to stain
The Countess with the promise
That Her lord at war would be cruelly slain

And She would rot.

Then tell me one thing more before I go

How am I supposed to live without you
How am I supposed to carry on
When all that I've been livin 'for is gone

Didn't come here to breakdown

Like a nightingale without a song to sing

Hearing words that I have never heard

Yeah
I done been in this game for years, it made me an animal
I learned that nobody else can be held accountable
But you for your career, not your manager, face it
Even he can fuck up a relationship
I learned it don't matter who's spitting better
While these rappers kill each other, them Jews they stick together
Like glue, and generate more money than Fubu
For something made 'for you by you'
Every hip-hop nigga listen and wishing he had your style
To go against you if you rip him and pass him by (yeah)
A mastermind is somebody who's actually kind
To everybody, and try to see every autograph is signed
The humblest way to look at your career
Is every nigga in here is one hit away
Yeah, whatever goes around in rap
Happens to not come back to me, and I ask you

Am I Young MC or a one-hit wonder?
Is it a following that supports me
BET, MTV, or ""E! True Hollywood Story""?
Can I hold my own
And rap without having to go back to Pharrell or Poke & Tone?
Can a married man still appeal to broads
Knowing everything he's spitting from here on in gon' be raw?
Can a nigga simply spit that real shit
Just for niggas that feel me, or will the system kill me?
If I drop this album and it sells
And the next one don't top it, will it be considered a failure?
If I had to drop outta the limelight for a while
Would you still mob me? Hell naw!
You would not give a fuck about me
If I worked a regular job, I don't even gotta ask y'all

He showed me you can do a dope album with no budget
Yeah, with lethal rhymes, they get that
He brought you into the game, he can take you out outta people's minds

Those who choose to leave me behind

Ingrosso,"After tonight, there'll be no coming home soon
No tears of regret, no smell of her perfume
No more dancing feet, to the beats that go boom
While I watch the sunrise all alone in my room

Tonight there'll be no pouring rain
No eyes wide shut to your never ending game
After tonight there'll be no me and you
No distant memories past for me to hold on to

See everybody's working to hold on to what they know
So I guess I kept believe in my tonight will never go
Some spend a lifetime searchin' trying to figure out
When hell stops and heaven begins

How soon is now?",How Soon Is Now,2009

""Sucka MC's please think twice"" -> Special Ed - Think About It

[Verse 1: Grap Luva]
Who'll be the sucka MC to get dismantled
I hope that you can handle your whipness or sees ya flippin gettin
Down with my lazy boy laidback style of speak
The funk makes you dance cheek to cheek
I be the black civilian who is bound to make a million
Or make enough loot so I can buy my own provillian
Throw a fat party and invite everybody
And play all the old school hits like Lodi Dodi
Connections like OPEC while ya hung up like a Kojak
I'm real like a ruby while ya fake like a pinchback
That's imitation gold if you didn't know
My rhymes flow as my vocab' grows and grows
I freak it for the basslines always walkin on ya frontline
Catch me while I'm boomin' in ya alkine
Yo I'm out like a shot from a tec
You need to think twice just to earn respect, so

[Chorus: Pete Rock](5X)
""Sucka MC's please think twice
You don't know what you doin'
Think about that"" 	-> Special Ed - Think About It

[Verse 2: Pete Rock]
Aiiyo, as I come through for '95 with the flav'
So amazin' the Boy Wonder's blazin'
Respect the mic check, one, two
Cause I display the funk material as I stand imperial
To others, gotta lay low, undercover
Cats flow to the hands for the crowd in the stands
So here I am, plus I rock to please the public
They want it, word son, they want it
To hear the Soul Brother disperse words of wisdom
When InI comin' direct on the set
So represent, a lot of rap niggaz came to win
But the style played out when they chose a different route
Whatever as I stay true to the game
Word to the troubled T-Roy you know my name
Keep an eye on the stakes as I watch my back
Think Twice before you try to grab the mic and react

[Chorus](5X)
[Verse 3: Rob-O]
Yo beg your pardon...
Whn I put one to the head now the funk shit startin'
Fine soul I headline for my public get mine
Yeah my rap subjects packed with potential
Plus the versatile elements to crush ya scent
I get down so cheer the mental
Rhyme-pro I'm Rob-O the super spectacular brown skin nigga from Africa
Blowin' up so it's impossible to get
With the highlight and fly right and the niggaz on my dick
Split when it's through, gotta skip with the Guinness Crew
Give a shout out to my Uptown Crew, word up
From New York, New York the Big Apple
To the four square miles Uptown armed for battle
Your niggaz is nice but my advice is you can't suffice
So Think Twice, uhh

Though I never knew you at all
You had the grace to hold yourself
While those around you crawled 

They crawled out of the woodwork
And they whispered into your brain
They set you on a treadmill
And they made you change your name 

And it seems to me you lived your life
Like a candle in the wind
Never knowing who to cling to
When the rain set in
And I would have liked to have known you
But I was just a kid
The candle burned out long before
Your legend ever did

Loneliness was tough
The toughest role you ever played
Hollywood created a superstar
And pain was the price you paid 

Even when you died
Oh the press still hounded you
All the papers had to say
Was that Marilyn was found in the nude 

And it seems to me you lived your life
Like a candle in the wind
Never knowing who to cling to
When the rain set in
Well I would have liked to have known you
But I was just a kid
The candle burned out long before
Your legend ever did

More than just Marilyn Monroe

From glen to glen, and down the mountain side.

Or when the valley's hushed and white with snow,
It's I'll be here in sunshine or in shadow,
Oh, Danny boy, oh Danny boy, I love you so!

But when ye come, and all the flowers are dying,
If I am dead, as dead I well may be,
You'll come and find the place where I am lying,
And kneel and say an Ave there for me.
And I shall hear, though soft you tread above me,
And all my grave will warmer, sweeter be,
For you will bend and tell me that you love me,
And I shall sleep in peace until you come to me!",Danny Boy (Londonderry Air),2003

On everything you do

Have you made your mother proud?
Have you swallowed your pride?

A bloodless kindred that never hindered
The chest has splintered, the bond has over-wintered
Heart cracked in several places...

Listen to the stream so violent, climbing up the hill so silent
Destitute inside these veins were slowly closing up, this heart weakened
Chances are you'll never get this, bled me dry it's time to forget this
No-ones ever seen me like this, should I ever fall this deep in love again?

Please forget the year I failed you, I won't hold you anymore
Pitched a tent in Sunny Lynton...
I wanted it back, I wanted it back, I wanted it back

And now I know just where those lips have been, I won't kiss you anymore
It seems these days always don't quite cut it
But you know best, yeah you know best, yeah you know best

I cannot let it rest in piece dear, I'll consume myself it was my only true fear
I hate this fucking aftertaste and I hate it even more without you here
This love was my pain, my hurt, my cancer, and all I wanted was to find an answer
You love and respect someone so deeply and then you lose them for your own, your own self odium

There's no more shame, the years of blame dissolve

You've got all that I need, your making my heart bleed
The sun ignored me until now, just lie here with me
Your eyes they hypnotize me every night I'm in a dream
Just lie here with me, just lie here with me

With just enough time for one more song

To know you were mine was enough

You took it away, and now it's all gone

You gave my life so mean set me free set me free
The finest years I ever knew were all the years I had with you
And I would give anything I own give up my life my heart my home
I would everything I own just to have you back again

You taught me how to love what it's of what it's of
You never said too much but still you showed me love
And I knew from watching you
Nobody else could ever know the part of me that can't let go
And I would give anything I own

Is there some you know you're loving them so but taking them all for granted
You may lose them one day someone takes them away

Summer time vibes come back again
Tell all your friends man!

Groovin' on a summer afternoon.
Groovin' couldn't get away too soon.

Now every woman every man come listen this one
From the heartical dan Mr. Pato Banton.
Me comin' in c-comin' in c-comin' in strong
With a positive summer time vibration.
Cause in the winter me can't take the cold
Body start shiver when the breeze start blow.
Car can't start cause the engine froze
Can't move me fingers, can't feel me toes.
But in the summer when the sun shine bright
Kick off me boot put on me air nike.
Leave me car and jump pon me bike
It's this kind of weather I like.

Well everyday people are in a rat race
But if I could I would just slow down the pace.
Like a record on a deck, switch the speed
From 45 down to 33.
Whoa! Nice and slow
Sun a shine and breeze a blow.
Lord! Nice and easy
Just a chill with me friends and family.

I can't imagine anything that's better
The world is ours whenever we're together
There ain't no place I'd rather be instead of groovin'!

Now in the struggle of life to achieve success
Everyone goes through some form of stress.
The rich man, poor man, beggar man, thief
Lawyer and the doctor, even the priest.
Whoa Oh! Some people take a trip to the beach.
Whoa Oh! To get a little stress relief.
Whoa Oh! Take a picnic down to the park.
Whoa Oh! With me children and me sweetheart.
Whoa Oh! Oh yes I have to confess.
Whoa Oh! The summer time vibes are the best.
Whoa Oh! People people if you agree.
Whoa Oh! I'm Pato Banton come follow me.",Homely Girl,2000

If you walk out now this is the last time that we speak
You tell her that you love her so then how could you love me?
Don't make promises you can't keep.

INoA 'OLe,"Do you remember the 21st night of September?
Love was changing the minds of pretenders
While chasing the clouds away

Our hearts were ringing
In the key that our souls were singing.
As we danced in the night,
Remember how the stars stole the night away

Ba de ya, say do you remember
Ba de ya, dancing in September
Ba de ya, never was a cloudy day

My thoughts are with you
Holding hands with your heart to see you
Only blue talk and love,
Remember how we knew love was here to stay

Now December found the love that we shared in September.
Only blue talk and love,
Remember the true love we share today

Ba de ya, say do you remember
Ba de ya, dancing in September

Hear the clock tickin'
I think of you
Caught up in circles
Confusion, there's nothing new
Flashback, warm nights
Almost left behind
Suitcase of memories
Time after
Sometimes you'll picture me
I'm walking too far ahead
You're calling to me
I can't hear what you say
And you say, go slow
I fall behind
The second hand unwinds

If you're lost, you can look
And you will find me
Time after time
If you fall, I will catch you
I will be waiting
Time after time
Time after time

After my picture fades
And darkness has turned to gray
Watching through windows
You're wondering if I'm okay
Secret stolen
All from deep inside
The 808's on time

I fall behind

I gotta see your face
'Cause, baby, oh, I've changed
I gotta break it down to you
Now don't forget it's me
This ain't no... these thangs
It ain't the same, oh no, baby
I don't want you lookin' like a fool
Baby, I'm fallin' out of love with you
I can't go on pretending that I love you
Baby, I'm fallin' out of love with you
I can't go on pretending that I want you
Don't want your love
I can't pretend no more
I had to let you know
I didn't want to make you wait
To find another love that wasn't true
Didn't want to tell your friends
I knew that they would tell you then
And that'll break your heart again
And I want us to continue being friends, but
Baby, I'm fallin' out of love with you (fallin' out of love)
I can't go on pretending that I love you (that I love you)
Baby, I'm fallin' out of love with you
I can't go on pretending that I want you
Don't want your love no more
Living on lies
You know I've tried
Living on; night-tears and over-cryin'
No, no, no, no
Living in pains, jumping on these thangs
You know what I'm sayin', babe
Don't want your love no more
Baby, I'm fallin' out of love wit' you (I'm fallin' out of love)
I can't go on pretending that I love you
(I don't love you, baby; no)
Baby, I'm fallin' out of love wit' you 
I'm fallin' out of love wit' you

I spend all my days and nights 
Trying to be a good friend to you 
But you really hurt me

So I'll be movin' on 
In time you look I will be gone 
'Cause when I needed you 
You were never there for me 
So I'll be floating in the breeze 
Like a falling leaves 
Don't look for me 'cause I'll be moving on 

You say you love me 
But the only time I know 
Is when I beg and plead 
Oh, you still say you love me 
But the only time I hear is 
When I say I'm leaving 
So I 

(Chorus) 

All those times I tried 
and all those nights I cried 
Did you ever come to me 
And try to dry my eyes 
All those times you strayed 
When you said you'd stay 
Those times are gone 'cause now I'm moving on

How you went away baby, you never knew I cared
Your picture on my pillow, tears down the side
I never will forget it baby, I need you in my life

Do you ever think of me like I think of you
Don't you wanna wait for me

You're so far away baby, but you are on my mind
Holding hands on the boardwalk on our favorite ride
On the beach where we met aw baby, footsteps in the sand
I remember like yesterday, reflections of your hands

All the stars man, the stars is beautiful tonight
Look at em!

Ghetto superstar, that is what you are
Comin from afar, reachin for the stars
Run away with me, to another place
We can rely on each other, uh-huh
From one corner, to another, uh-huh

[Pras]
Uh, yeah, yo, yo
Some got, hopes and dreams, we got, ways and means
The surpreme dream team, always up with the schemes
From hubcaps to sellin raps, name your theme
My rise to the top, floatin on this cream
Who the hell want to stop me, I hated those who doubt me
A million ReFugees with unlimited warranties
Black Caesar, dating top divas
Diplomatic immunity, no time for a Visa
And just because, I'ma shoot them one by one
Got five sides to me, somethin like a pentagon
Strike with the forces of King Solomon
Lettin bygone be bygone, and so on, and so on
I'ma teach this cat, how to live in the ghetto
Keepin it retro-spective from the get go
Lay low, let my mind shine like a halo
P-P-Politic with ghetto senators on the d-low

[Chorus]

[Ol' Dirty Bastard]
One two, and you don't stop, yo
My eyes is sore, bein the senator
Behind closed doors hittin truth to the seafloor
The rich go North ignore, the tug of war
While the kids are poor, open more and better drug stores
So I became hardcore, couldn't take it no more
I'ma reveal EVERYTHING, change the law
I find myself, walkin the streets
Tryin to find what's really goin on in the streets

[Pras]
Yea, yo, yo, yo
Now every dog got his day, needless to say
When the chief away that's when them cats want to play
I told you, dance around these fools like Cassius Clay
Stretch my heater and make you do a pas de bourre
Kick your balls like Pele, pick em doin ballet
Peak like Dante, broader than Broadway
Get applause like a matador, crowd yellin !Ole!
Who the hell want to see me, from B.K., to Cali
Come on

[Chorus]

[Pras]
Yeah... yo, yeah
Just when you thought it was safe in a common place
Showcase your finances, losin bets in the horse race
Two faced, gettin defaced, out like Scarface
Throw your roll money, let me put on my screwface
[Ol' Dirty Bastard]
Well I'm paranoid at the things I said
Wonderin what's the penalty from day to day, I'm hangin out
partyin with girls that never die, the C.O.'s
pickin on the small fries, my campaign tellin lies
Was just spreadin my love, didn't know my love
was the one holdin the gun in the glove
But it's all good as long as it's understood

well I guess it's 'cause I'm sorta famous. 
I'm sendin out dope shit, how the fuck can ya blame em.
When the fuckin bitches come and drive by , liftin up their shirts and letting tittys fly,
Like I really want to see the shit, a drunk ass slut and her fuckin titty,
And when it comes down to the sex part, they say love shit and try to soften my heart.
But a bitch will always give more head, with a cold double barrel pressed againt their forhead.
that's the way to get it done around here.
In my neck of the woods Id'a never met fear.
Me and the boys the rumblin we always drop the hoes even though I might be fumbling.
You know Violent J won't slip, yo G, they hate his I Q-tip, 
'cause his punk ass went ahead and sold out, now his family's at the funeral and he's getting rolled out, and everybody's fake cryin', 'cause nobody really gives a fuck of him dyin'
There rollin hp's. it'll never end, 'cause I saw Johnny butt fuckin one of his friends, 
So there on my case about it, because I told everyone he likes to suck a good dick.
Now were all grippin in a 68 bucket
Seen a fine bitch, but I said fuck it, 'cause I know how that story goes,
First she buys me dinner, then I fuck that hoe.
But I was in a hurry to get down town , A yo Mexican festival, you don't want to miss the show, with brews and faygo we was chillin too much never stop and my homie Kid villain
there's mother fuckers starin at me all night, given me a look like I was fuckin his wife.

and mold me, in a way that you freed me but still hold me

Now you tryin to use integration just to fool us
Like Malcolm said, we been hoodwinked and bamboozled
Mama cryin, and I ain't lyin
I'm going to Washington for justice, I'ma get it, or die tryin
Don't hesitate, he's at the gate
And that's a million black men in one place to set it straight
So black women applaud the black God

And every brother here thinkin yeah we need to holla at you
About this overdue bidness

Insane Clown Posse,"Showed up at your high school prom
With an axe in my mothafuckin' palm
And I jumped out the front, straight swinging
Necks and backs went flinging,
Head to toe
I went psychopathic
Choping throats with a hatchet
'Cause they try to get me
So I took a head with me
Ran down the hall butt-naked
If you got a life I'ma take it
'Cause I got it going on
And I broke to the female john
Motherfuckers think I'm sick
You ever seen a bitch take a shit?
Fuck dat, let her dookey-ass be
'Cause female shittin' is news to me
Climbed up the fire escape
How many lives can one motherfucker take?
One life, two life, three life, four
Throw me a Mack-10 I'm bound to take more
Fifty lives coming on eighty
Fuck this, I'm fidna whoop this lady
Tied the bitch up to the light post
Slapped her in her face 'cause I'm psycho
Beat her down and beat her up
Fucking slut
So bitches make me wonder
Kicked her gut and left my number
""Call me, fucking nympho.""
Then I threw her through a window
Broke and I climbed up a tree, guy
Came back down, I don't know why
Straight up insanity
Damn, if it ain't a family
Hope they come home soon
'Cause I'm waiting in the bedroom
Sparky! We're home Sparky! Watch your foot, honey.""
""Honey? Where's Sparky?""
""Mom! Dad! Lisa's in the bathroom! And I've gotta go really bad!""
""Don't worry little Joey, I'll get the bitch out!""
""Ahh!""
""Mom! Dad!""
""Like it? Have another.""
I diced all cinco
Then I threw em' in the Pinto
Now I'm on Vernor bumpin' the funk
With 5 dead bodies in the trunk
And I'm doin' about ninety
To the blue and reds behind me
You can pull me over, jack
Just don't look in the back
""Hey, what's your fuckin' hurry son?""
Just don't look in the trunk
""We got a wild one here, he's naked.""
Just don't look in the trunk
""He's got blood on his hands and face.""
Just don't look in the trunk
""Be advised, the car is registered to a Wilson family.""
Just don't look in the trunk
""Oh, the trunk you say, huh? Okay, waddya say we just have a look-see here? Oh shit!""
I'm gone and I ditched the ride
And left the dead Wilsons inside
Jetting and I'm hopping fences
Fidna do like my man in Culeen, Texas
'Cause I'm psycholistic
You look once and you missed it
Look twice and it caught your eye
Me, beating the shit out of some guy
With a bag of bricks
Impressing them dirty-ass sewer chicks
A klepto you can't trust
Should've known when I jacked the bus
Fourteen passengers riding it
One naked psycho driving it
And we goin' crippin'
And there'll be no slipping
'Cause I'm thinking the worst
Shit like woman and children die first
Make you shiver
When I drove that bitch in the river
Everybody dies
Only me survives
Innocent fucks is what I want
So I'm heading for the restaurant
""Aww shit vato, I'm fuckin' full, man.""
""Fuckin' burritos man!""
""That burrito fucked me up man....Aw shit, duck man, fuck!""
""See'mon mothafucka!""
There's always gotta be a hero
But I can't be stopped with silver bullets
Or a wooden stake
It's your life I quickly take
Don't talk shit, I take 'em
Take your life, take your life
Coppers and choppers pursue
The boys in blue
The whole caroo
I do what they never think
So I'm heading for the 18th precenct
'Cause when they finally call it quits
I'll be there to cut their necks
And that's what I did
I hate a fucking pig
I get a job at the donut shop
Just to poison a cop
Kleptopathic
And I'll fuck you up in a straight jacket
'Cause they finally got me
Broke my legs and shot me
But I'm still laughing
'Cause of what happened
On the night of the axe

Well, they let the gate up so I bail
It's been six months pick me up from the county jail
With a smog mother payin' my dues
Steel toliets, worn blankets, and rubber shoes
But I ain't naggin'
Here come the fellas I can hear the muffler draggin'
Ain't been the car long
And the Faygo is almost gone
My nuts are kinda hard so I need a mate
So my homeboy's cousin set me up with a blind date
She said ""Pick me up at three""
Can't bitch, the bus don't ride your street, ho
We gonna eat at Mexican Village
Take a cab and I'll pay the tab
And when she showed, well, I'll be damned
Left my wallet at home on the TV stand
Have her pay him and for dinner too
The knot in my sock, it done bit you
She's all prettied up for nothing
I'm smelling like shit and my chin is scruffing
And I'm chewing on my food like a pitbull
Cause I won't front for the ho
Stuck my face in a bowl of soup
And just sucked it all up threw my missin' tooth
The bitch jumped up with a boom
""I have to fix my hair"" and broke to the bathroom
She's got the tab, so I go for mine
And order up some '52 vintage wine
Hey, Louie, bring a fuckin' steak with that
Motherfuckers like jail say fuck dat
She's back now and her hair ain't fixed
Probably took a long greasy-ass smelly shit
I ain't saying nothing though
I ain't saying nothing bout the funkin' ho
What's up bitch, I'm ready to break
How long can one fat bitch take?
Quite snacking and pay me saps
Cause we goin' home to meet her pops

""So Joe, what is that you do for a living?""
""Aww, come on pops, you seen me selling rocks on
Verner and Springwell. Matter fact, I think I sold
to that fat bitch in the kitchen""

Your dad's really cool sweetheart
I mean him letting me use his car
And he slipped me a fifty
Violent J is kinda nifty
If I'd a hit you'd be home through
But now your coming home with me
Dad I gotta bitch in the bedroom
Take your ass to the bar and don't come home soon
Now the juggla's known to smack hoes
But I need the shot too
So I switch to the mack mode

""Now woman, you know I love you
So why don't you just let me fuck you
Now bitch, I know you's a freak
So let me get a little kiss on your cheek
And a fuck to go with that
Come on, nympho, let me hit that
Tell ya what you let me stick it
And I gotta left over piece of chicken for ya
Ya little sewer skank
Ya nasty little pipe-smoking sac-chasing ho
And that was that
A little smooth talking she was on her back
And I'm finally sticking
Dump ya, and I'm eating my chicken

I told my mother one day I'd be wealthy
Can't forget my first day at school
Got stabbed in the head with a pencil, but it's cool
Get my education
A job and a family, a good reputation
And what about grade two?
Got shot in the neck and the bullet went straight through
But I'm packing a textbook
Don't fuck with me 'cause I'm going to grade three
Thank god it's lunch in a minute
Bit into my hot dog with a razor blade in it
And it cut my tongue off
But I know how to multiply so what's up, boss
Finally had to step out
I dropped out of school when they ripped my neck out
Who knows where the road led?
Seen a man with a briefcase and no head
So I'm like fuck that
Show me a quarter and an ounce of crack
And I'm straighter than a fucking lightpost
I sold a lot of crack but I bought the most
Now I'm a basehead down on my luck
Roaming the streets and got hit by a Mack Truck
And thrown about a block
But I'm thinking nothing but gimme a rock
Holding my sign I'll work for crack
With my old-ass E.T. shirt on my back
And I'm sleeping in the gutter
Right next to Jam Town's mother
I'm eating dead rats in the street
I keep on checking for my ownheart beat
Now I'm weighing at a buck-o-five

Got my first taste of life in hell
I ate a dead, shh, but don't tell

First day, they broke my back
Next day, they broke my neck
Third day, they broke my leg
Fourth day, they broke my head

Seen a freak in a week and my nuts fell off
So I'm finna escape
How much shit can one clubno take?

Shot me off and I fell in the razor wire
I'm all tangled up, cut cut cut slit slit cut cut
You don't love me, I really don't care
Tie my ass up in the electric chair
I got no family, I got no friends
I pray to God that my life ends
They thought that they had killed me
They took me to the morgue
I'm just a little stiff that's all, like a board
I lay there in my coffin, just chill and wait and chill
But then I jump out knife swinging all about
And motherfucking-mother-mother-mother-motherfucking kill
I used to wonder what life's about
Until it chewed me up and spit me out
Your ghetto created a psycho nut
Not just psycho psycho nut
Now I'm living in the walls of your house
And I'll die there and lay and rot like a dead mouse
I'm packing a sickle I'm on your roof and I'm playing the fiddle
You want me in a straight jacket
'cause when I see a throat, I'm a hack it
Where I'm at?  What's my name?
Somehow, somewhere, I got hit by a train
And it ripped my legs off
Huh, nothing but a minor coft
You can't get me I swing from a tree
Shouting and cussing and shooting at me
Everybody's end make two cents
A branch broke and I fell on a picket fence
I'm stuck and they're coming to get me
Rip myself off and I took my lungs with me
I'm stuffing them back in

Violent J, motherfucker, psychopathic

Psychopathic

Thought you know bitch
The ICP is made up of psychotic
Demented psycho clumsy motherfuckers
And we'll put a hook on your bumb leg
Like it ain't nobody's business

So I'm standing by the train tracks
Then you see me running but naked with a battle axe
I'm swinging and slicing and chopping and cutting and..
Aah, until I'm nothing
Seems like I always get beat down
Like the hawk turned to the wicked clown
Tail turned out to the ghetto 'cause
Southwest Detriot is comended one's home
So you might see me at a festival
Cussin', rude, and scratching my testicles
With a cold two-liter in hand
Rapping to the bitch at the french fry stand
Take it to the Patent Park
Then I'll make a sexist remark
'cause they're all eventually bitching
Serve me fucking take your ass to the kitchen
Police don't like me it's obvious
Just don't look in the trunk
Or the sight'll make you sick
Violent J, motherfucker, psychopathic

(theme from ""Halloween"")

Yeah, I've always been a psycho
Psycho-psycho-sick-psycho-sick-psycho-psycho
I'll throw rocks at stray dogs
Build crackhouses out of Lincoln logs
I cut class, said I was a faker
You was in school, I was home watching Green Acres
Now I'm all up in your face
You can barely hear the rap with all that bass
I'm running with a southwest street gang
And I never let my southwest meat hang
'cause you know what ICP's all about
Take a brick off the street
And bust you in the mouth
Find the girl's daddy's rich
And his sweet little angel's my sewer freak bitch
But I filled the turkey up with the stuffing
Like Billy Bill say, ""a bitch ain't nothing""
Grab her by the arm and break
Grab her by the life and take it
And, ya know, the sight'll make ya sick

Step to the left, step to the right

The Time has come for the blood to run into the streets paved with gold 
We have lived in the zoo of the ghetto for so long 
And like animals we kill each other for the hatred of others 
We must move into the suburbs and punish the rich for their ignorance 
For the horror of death  that is part of our life in our neighborhood 
And give them a taste of the same 
And when we kill the governments children 
And the streets smell of death 
Maybe then we will see our situation in a new light 
And put an end the the chaos in the ghetto and an end to the killings 

[Violent J]
Heard what's going on in the free world 
Broke out the asylum and killed a girl 
Just to warm you, just to get it on 
'Cause I'm gonna be cutting throats till the break of dawn 
Can't nobody get me 
I've always been a psycho now they coming with me 
That's straight when we team up 
'Cause I believe every throat deserves a good cut 
Look in my brain its fucking insane 
Roll around naked in the acid rain 
Rich bitch fucka took me for a sucka 
Now we killing you instead of killing each other 
Walked in the house, shot him in the mouth 
Leaned back the head, and pulled the brains out 
My list are strong its only a saw 
The government fronts like they don't know what is going on 
Fuck, I'll take the matter in my own hands 
Cut ya down cat, cut ya down 
'Cause I know the rich go jogging 
And I'm waiting in the bushes, axe to the noggin
About thirty or forty times, 
Psychodelic sick with the psycho psycho rhymes 
But ya keep the killer in one place, 
But I'm at ya door, motherfucker have a taste!

End this ghetto war for the homies that I once knew

The word on the streets is that you a bitch
What's up with that, man?""

[Shaggy 2 Dope]
Motherfuckers tweek, gotta tweek while ya tweek
Golley guy's rhythm, 'cause me on mic, my on meek
Get off me, dog, before I sting your chin
I let my nutsac flap in the wind
'cause I'm 2 Dope, clown loco G, 
And it's one chop, two boing, boom chop three
In the melon, in the back of the melon
One black, two black eyeballs swelling
Always back with stickin, taking back what's more to lordy
Sippin on the blunt, puffing on the 40
Or the O-Z, muthafuck me
Fuck Stuart Frankie, they call me 
Jelly jello boy 'cause my nutsac jiggles
And when it's cold out, my nutsac shrivles
And crawls at my booty all warm and snug
And gets chased out by the booty ho bug
Goddamn, I ain't who I am
I'm always fucking fat bitches named Pam
Nineteen years of breathing smog
Has got me mental
So get off me, dog!...

Insane Clown Posse,"""Ladies and gentlemen  the house of mirrors 
For just one bet  venture through this wonderful exhibit 
See yourself in all the weird shapes and sizes 
You  young man  would you like to go into the house of mirrors 
Well  okay 
Have a good time  son 
And good luck finding your way out 
Wait a minute  I don't like it in here 
Hey  wait a minute  let me out of here 
Let there's dead bodies in here 
There's dead bodies in here 
I don't like it in here!!!"" 

Step inside, come my way 
This here is your fatal day 
You have lied, they have cried 
Now your life has been denied 
Look into the big mirror 
Your reflection is so clear 
Devil's head, rotting flesh 
With the snakes inside your chest 
In the mirror you can't hide 
You've been granted Jacob's lide 
Whipping fear, spinning pain 
All you crying is in vain 
You're the beast you never knew 
This reflects the things you do 
Others starving down the block 
Richie's heart is like a rock 
How can I make a law? 
I'm just here to break your jaw 
House of Glass, down and up 
You might get your ass cut 
Mirror of Life, Mirror of Pain 
Death, I wave my magic cain 
Your last words are those of fear 
But they go unheard in the House of Mirrors 

[Chorus x2] 
Mirror mirror on the wall 
Who's the wickedest of all 
Three blind mice, deepest fear 
Welcome to the House of Mirrors 
 
Magic wand, magic mirror 
Timeless clock says death is near 
Death is here, death is on 
My king bishop takes your pawn 
You can't break House of Mirrors 
That's bad luck for seven years 
Only in my wicked realm 
Of thee untold, now unfold 
Thinking back, what you do 
Buy a richie home or two 
Even though some down and out 
You keep what you could live without 
You're the beast you never knew 
This reflects the things you do 
Others starving down the block 
Richie's heart is like a rock 
First I grab, then I stab 
Cut you up into a slab 
Grind and twist, flick my wrist 
Toss you in the magic mist 
Look into Halls of Glass 
Every mirror shows the past 
With no love you kick the sin of face 
Now your place is in the House of Mirrors 

[Chorus x2] 

Three blind mice, your worst fear 
Look into the deadly mirror 

Welcome to the House of Mirrors, Mr. Exec 
You should explain to E why ICP should let you live 
As you look on I see this image in your reflection 
A bigot under cover, showing no affections 
To the ghettos and the hoods 
Just look at you, you think for us, you're too good 
Claiming all you got and you can die tomorrow 
And when that shit happens, there's no pinion, no sorrow 
'Cause you refuse to lift a hand 
And you know it's a blessing to help a brother man stand 
And if I were you I'd fear myself 
Knowing I was selfish and wouldn't let another near my wealth 
You just gotta let em fall 
You Violent J, ""what up"", bash that head against the wall 
And don't let him run for the door (where you goin, bitch?) 
Make him detour to the sore 
And let's wash away his bigot sins 
While we welcome in some more of his bigot ass friends 
And let them see what they really like 
Hand-high riding the Benz and I'm a clown-riding the bike 
So look closely in the mirror 
You're the beast you never knew, so be the next to volunteer 
To live in the hood with the ICP 
Yo, J, throw away the key to the House of Mirrors

As I howl like a dog and I'm running down the street
Hiding in the trees, hiding in the bushes
You're sitting on your couch and I'm underneath your cushions

Slip in the cracks of the walls of the eave

I'm begging on my knees and you slam your golden gate
So I pick myself up and I snuck around the back
And took your money stack then stabbed your fucking neck

Insane Clown Posse,"[Violent J]
Sitting in the class with my head on the desk
Teacher's trying to talk but I could give a fuck less
I'm staring at the freak that I know I'm in love with
But she don't even know my name it's always been the same
I just lay my head down and drown in my spit
Nobody even notices I'm here 'cause I ain't shit
I hear voices but I don't know what they saying
Sweat is on my forehead 'cause my brain's inside decaying
And this bitch that I love probably don't have no idea
She's talking to her friends I'm in the corner and I see her
Something's happening but it isn't very clear
Sounds like a bell, sounds like an electric chair
Next thing I know walking in the crowded hall
So many different faces that I throw up on the wall
Some are yelling ""sick"" and the others stop and stare
But I don't care, I'm in a hurry going nowhere
See, my head is spinning 'cause I'm lonely and I'm twisted
But I have a secret everybody missed it
Just a nobody and I think it's a drag
But I got Mr. Johnson's head in my bookbag

[Chorus (2x)]
I couldn't stand the pressure, not another day
I didn't like the fucker Mr. Johnson anyway
I sat up in his class, he hung a rebel flag
I cut the bigots head off and I stuffed it in my bag

[Violent J]
I wish somebody knew me 'cause then they could say I'm wrong
But since nobody knows me I got it going on
I'm staring at the clock, I listen for the tock
I gotta couple food stamps folded in my sock
I guess I'm just a ghost 'cause everybody walks through me
If I died in class they would probably say they knew me
Or they wouldn't care, they wouldn't even move
A dead body rotting in the back of the room
For weeks and months, stinking up the class
Until somebody noticed then they throw me in the trash
I can hear the teacher man talking about Columbus
He nothing but an old dead fuck with a compass
Ran up on a beach and threw everybody off
And then he claimed discovery and now we all applaud
I don't give a fuck to learn your uncle went to hell
I'm trapped in mind and my brain is my cell
But I have a key, it's called insanity
I stick in my brain to unlock eternity
Just a nobody and I think it's a drag
But I got Mr. Johnson's head in my bookbag

[Chorus (2x)]

""Okay, today we're gonna learn about A Great Freedom. If you'll turn 
Your textbooks to Chapter Four we'll get started. America's the 
Land of the free, all racists live together in harmony, and we are all
Treated equal, we all live togerther in the same wealthy community 
And we are alternate equals. Yes?""
""Man, Mr. Johnson already taught us this. Ain't he ever coming back?""
""Uh, uh, he's, uh, very ill right now.""

[Violent J]
No, they can sit and front about it all day
But I left his fucking body in the hallway
And in the morning they opened up the door
And seen his motherfucking carcass laying on the floor
But they would never suspect me I'm just a nerd
I try to speak my word, it always goes unheard
I could chop my arms off and run around the class
I doubt they'd even notice, but I'd be dying fast
'cause they'd rather learn about redneck chicker
Who owned a couple slaves but I guess it doesn't matter
Fuck Washington, Benjamin, fuck em all ah
They can suck my nuts till they wood teeth fall out
And the class wanna know who could it be
But I'm like Dewey Boodie, you ain't never heard of me
I'm just a nobody and I think it's a drag
But I got his motherfucking melon chilling in my bookbag

So I break the law but I'm not to blame

And I steal a car and I grip the wheel
And I park the car then I steal it again
'cause I really don't know what's happening

I wait for night to fall then I walk outside
And then I run back in 'cause I don't want to die

As smoke fills the sky enough to block the rain

Look over me 'cause my brain is fried
And I don't have a name, I don't have a home

Throw the bitch out and now the funk pounds, yo
Some say it's just a hearse, but it's much worse
It's an old dark bucket with a clown curse
Long, dark, very spooky scary
I drink an old 40 bottle full of bloody mary, why
'cause I'm Violent J, sick in the nug-bone
I make strange sounds, clowns with frowns
Break it on down, break it up till the break of dawn
Look out your window it's the wagon in your front lawn
Ah, boom, aboockaboomba 
We do the dance of the death until you get in the car
Then I pull your tongue out slap you in the face with it
Say the joker did it in the...

Wagon Wagon, dead bodies draggin
I'm a dead body so you know I love riding in the...
Wagon Wagon, dead bodies draggin
Now, here's your chance

[Violent J]
We don't do drive-by's in the wagon
Instead we just get out and stab your fuckin ass
And there ain't no telling how many clowns inside
Told you seventeen but I lied
'cause I'm wicked and I'm wild, wicked wild
I caught wild deer, rode it home from Bel Isle
I play the organ like an old mental case
I can freak the cello, like Chris Conley on bass
In the wagon, I throw fingers out the window
And when you roll the window down you can smell Indo
But it ain't mine, it belongs to a stiff over there
Puffin on a Jim Square
Heavy long, rumbling, tumbling
Step into my ride and your ass goes stumbling
Out the back with your neck in a rut
Gotta get home before the sun comes up on my...

Insane Clown Posse,"Greetings
Welcome to the gypsy of fortunes
Your coin was very much appreciated
And now I shall grant you your future
It seems my cards of tarot have dealt you a very odd hand
A hand of six jokers card, this is very rare
And suggest something neusant is approaching
You should be visited by a dark circus
A circus that holds pain and anguish
This travelling mass of evil will leave you corpse to rot
While entrapping your soul to displayed at future stops
Oh yes, you should also be aware that it is your own evil doings
That have brought about this carnival's visit
All of the sins and hatred you have cast during your life
Have whipped and spun into form, the form of one
One who leads this gruesome parade of pain into your life
One sinister beast, one known only as RINGMASTER
Welcome ladies and gentlemen to the museum, the wax museum
Thousands of dead souls covered in wax
All of the rare exhibits you are about to encounter
Are strange and wonderous creations of the one and the only
Leader of them all
So both dead and undead please welcome the are-are-are-ringmaster

""Purpose, question, kill""

The ICP is of the Ringmaster
And the Ringmaster's of the attutes of mankind
G-ya, motherfucker, now you gotta face your worst enemy
And that's yourself
Every wicked thing you've ever done
Has come back now
And it's gonna whip your little ass, bitchboy

Us, we're just clowns
We just work for the Ringmaster
With the wave of his magic wand
I step forward, wind back
And swing this battle axe
Upside your motherfucking head
Hoooo!!!

So step right up cause the are-are-are-ringmaster
Takes you on the ride of your life
Horror and fear, smiles and tears
And oh everso over do
The Ringmaster rises up and lifts across the sky
Through the forest and down the river
Along the valley, over the hill
And down the trail and up the sidewalk
Only to surprise you and yours
At your very front door

Drank my last cup of dead body stew
Paint my face, creep up and say BOO!
Nobody knows what I'm about
Walk around town with my guts hanging out
Chewin on toes, fuckin dead hoes
Bark at the moon everytime the wind blows
Why do I do the things that I do?
Who are you? Fuck you, and fuck Jerry Lou too
Fucked your mother at the Motel 8
Fingers in her booty, strawberry shake
Daddy walks in and see the sick clown
Moving his butt-cheeks up and down

And everybody sucks my nuts, shucks

Ya know what I'm saying
All you bitches, man
Come over to my house
And I'ma take ya upstairs
And I'ma stick you with my wang
Ya know what I'm saying?
I stuck her with my wang
She hit me in the balls
I grabbed her by her neck
And I bounced her off the walls
She said it was an accident and then apologized
But I still took my elbow and blackened both her eyes
I stuck her with my wang
Bitchy bitchy hoe
I'd like to stick a Faygo bottle in her neden hole
I twist ya and turn ya, just to shake it up
Pop off the lid now it's shooting out her butt
I stuck her with my wang
She grabbed by me nuts
She told me that she loved me then commenced on the sucking
I tried to hold it back, but I nutted in her ear
When it dried up, the bitch couldn't hear

(Chorus)
I stuck her with my wang (He stuck her with his wang, yo)
I stuck her with my wang (He stuck her with his wang, then he hit the door)

I stuck her with my wang
I'm ringing dingaling
After I hit it, my boys will do the same
Bitches come in flocks when the carnivals in town
Suckin on my nuts, trying to be down
I stuck her with my wang
The freaky little slut
She wanted me to stick my finger in and out her butt
I asked the bitch why, she gave no reply
I went psycholistic and I stuck it in her eye
I stuck her with my wang
I hit it slow motion
I had the Ringmaster brew me up a love potion
I put it on her neden, I know this sounds insane
Her coochie started whistling and singing out my name
Shaggy, Shaggy, Shaggy, stick me with your wang!

(Chorus X2)

I stuck her with my wang
I hit it chicken style
I hit up in Meijer's in the home improvement aisle
She called me Bob Vila when I stuck it in the place
I tied her legs behind her head and kicked her in the face
I stuck her with my wang
I took some Elmer's glue
I slapped it on her titties and I stuck her to the roof
And when I came back, I opened up the door
Her titties were so long they was draggin on the floor
I stuck her with my wang
A little two on one
I told her call a friend over, we can have some fun
I heard her knock knock, I'm finna get some stank
I opened up the door

Hiding under covers, they're trying get me

I got me a plan to get the shit out
Pulled out a ice-pick and picked the bitch up
Smackin' it pushin' it in my ear fuck!
Lord oh please what's happening to me?
It's the poisonous air from the smokestacks G
Seeping in my head, fucking up my brain
Driving me crazy, nuts, insane
Sewer, sludgy, greasy slime I'm always bucking with all the time
'cause he's my motherfucking enemy number one
Trying to puncture on my life by filling up my lungs
The shit you call air, but I call it death
'Cause it makes me choke and lose my breath
My toes begin to curl, my fingers start to fold
Got drool on my lips and my body's getting cold
Don't know what to do so now I start to panic
But it's too late, I'm dead the smog got me fucked!

It's another cloudy day, it's raining, but not water
It's raining oil out the sky I think I oughta
Make a run but I slipped on an oil-slick
I can't move, I think I broke my fucking neck
It's no surprise, I'm laying there paralyzed
Looking up into the sky helped me realize about us
The clouds form a Devil's face, it must be a mirror image of the human race
And oh shit, here it comes-the deadly smog
I can tell by the howl of the stray dog
The air is calm, the streets are so still
When the smog creeps out the pipes for a kill
Broken neck, I'm chillin' 'cause I'm a gonner
I can see the smog creepin' around the corner
I lay still and hope it doesn't notice me
Oh shit, shit, fuck, fuck, shit G!
Looking up just to see his deadly jaws
I think, I think, I think I shit my draws
But its okay, the smog left me alone
So I lay and watch the clouds turn into stone
And come crashing down over Del Ray

Thoughts in my head
Of a dead body laying in his house for 3 weeks
Until his neighbors complain about the smell
Didn't he have anybody to know he was dead?
Thoughts in my head
Of a serial killer in Iowa decided to kill himself
Before he actually killed someone else
Was that good?
Thoughts in my head
Of an ocean of blood
That when the bombs drop and causes tidal waves
Tidal waves that paint the town red
Everybody's dead
Thoughts in my head
Of mothers and fathers who look at me
And I can feel the hatred in their in eyes
And it's cold
And children are nothing but them in the future 
Accept it
Thoughts in my head
Of a woman sitting on her porch, bald-headed
Because of a disease she caught from the air
The air that we breathe
The air we breathe is fucked up--Its fucked up!
Thoughts in my head 
Of people want to kill me
But you can't kill me
'cause if you kill me, I'll be back to kill you
Done it before, do it again
Thoughts in my head 
Of a sixteen year old little fucking punk
Sitting in his classroom
Drawing a gang sign on a folder
In his Birmingham Hills
Well fuck what you know about love
Thoughts in my head 
Of people despise me and hate me and don't know me
I hate you too
So it's all good, it's all good
Thoughts in my head
Of a society that is so fucked up and so evil
That if somebody prays, they get made fun of and laughed at
But it's not gonna be funny
They'll be laughing
When the bombs drop and the town is red

""Wake...
Revenge is mine
12 people will die tonight""

Now I look and then reborn
Though I have just until dawn
I remember every face
Spirits show me every place
First one sleeps inside his bed
Place my fingers on his head
To each temple push and smother
Till my fingers touch each other

Next one makes love to his wife
Only wish to take his life
For his family's done no wrong
Place his children on the lawn
Tell the misses, leave the room
Less she wish to witness doom
Grab the squirming filthy goat
And shove the dresser down his throat

I must quickly use my gift
Next two work the midnight shift
Drinking coffee in the back
I will listen to them chat
Hear them speaking of my death
Hear the laughter in their breath
But the laughter quickly died
When their heads collide

Die!
You're gonna die...

Now my anger's growing worse
Next one's working as a nurse
Have to make a doctor's call
Drag my body down the hall
Grab a scalple and a blade
Time to play the nurse's aide
Operate and strap her down
Carve her face into a clown

Killed another then three more
Now we're down to only four
This man drives a taxi cab
Another wicked life to grab
Screaming that he'd thought I'd died
Let's go for a taxi ride
In the wreck of twisted steel
The stearing wheel becomes his meal

This man watches his TV
Scanning channels endlessly
Stops at station forty-four
It's the Wicked Clown Show
Watch me juggle, watch me dance
In 3-D watch me enhance
Watch me crawl out from the screen
And squeeze your neck until you're green

Die!
You're gonna die...

Time...

Even though, there's just one left
I feel my bones becoming stiff
And now I wonder endlessly
The spirits have abandoned me
My limbs are falling piece by piece
My ears and fingers in the street
But still yet see no morning sun
And here's my victim's early run

Quickly grab him from behind
Round his neck with fishing twine
Keep him still and pull the string
Watch his head go bobbaling
Listen to my riddle song
Even though my crime was wrong
Murder me just for your law
And I'll be back for all y'all

Die!
You're gonna die...

Up a couple feet to get a better sight
Is that any reason to scream and run in fright

I guess I'm just another freak show thing

'cause when I was two my momma left me at the circus
Abandoned at the carnival with the freak shows
Like bad boys, hermaphrodites and old man crow
But then I escaped to the ghetto zone
Started a crew of my own, motherfucker, I'm not alone

I don't want no stuck up
Little sassy rassy bitch
Ya know what I'm saying
I want me a cold stanky bitch
So bring it on, dead momma""

[Violent J]
She's as lovely as always, my baby hasn't changed
Except for the hole that's in her forehead, you can see her brains
Nevertheless, our love is still forever true
Her eyes have withered, her skin has now a tint of blue
My baby's dusty and dirty, and wrinkled clothes
And now I notice, the maggots chewed off all her toes
The earth has been rather cruel to my darling sugar
Is that a bug upon her face? oh, it's just a booger
I lean her head back to kiss her cracking lips
And then her neck crack, also does her hips
I must be gentle, my baby girl's a little rusty
A little dusty, but most of all, a little musty
I notice that, when we lay together on the lawn
We lay till dawn, I notice her left eye is gone
We said goodbye and everything turned out alright
I'll see you again tomorrow night, because I need a...

[Chorus (1x)]

Check it out, bitch!
You aren't getting stank, skank
Get your asses shoveling
Then you'll want a lil somthin somthin
Them cramey graveyard bitches
They DOWN WITH THE CLOWN!!!

Insane Clown Posse,"""This is a Channel 7 news brief because the news is happening now! 
Good evening  Mort Perkins reporting. Our top story tonight: Police and 
investigators are still trying to figure out how and why somebody stole four dead bodies from the 
Wayne County morgue late Monday night. Police say the apparent body thief entered 
through the basement window  but how they eluded the security and alarm system is still a 
mystery. But what we at Channel 7 are wondering: What kinda sick FUCK would steal four 
dead bodies anyway? Details at 11."" 

Dead bodies, dead bodies all over the street. 
55-65, bodies at least. 
I hang with the stiffs till the break of dawn. 
I'm always finding bodies when I'm mowing the lawn. 
Drag 'em in the house, throw 'em in the oven. 
Wicked clown lovin' that dead body grubbin'. 
Tastes like chicken, finger lickin' deep fried. 
I ate a dead body, but don't tell. I lied. 
I just ate my first dead body last week, 
Still got the fingernail caught in my teeth. 
Before ya start yellin' and cursin' my name, 
Remember somethings wrong with my brain, insane. 
Second I was born, doctor threw me against the wall. 
Kicked open the doors and he whipped me down the hall. 
I'm sliding and I'm boucin' off shit like a hockey puck. 
And my mother's like, ""What the fuck?!"" 
He said I was born of an alien race. 
Born with a hatchet and a juggalo face. 
But I'm not a martian, you wouldn't understand. 
I'm just a dead body man. 

""We've got bodies! Dead bodies! We got fat ones, skinny ones, males, females, 
hermaphrodites! We got somebodies! We got nobodies! Bodies, bodies, bodies! 
WOO!"" 

Dead bodies, dead bodies in the back of my van. 
All the little kiddies love the dead body man. 
I drive through my neighborhood ringin' my bell. 
Some people run cause they don't like the smell. 
Others line up just as quick as they can. 
To try to catch a glimpse of the dead body man. 
It's all good, if you can stand the funk. but uh..... 
Just don't look in the trunk. 
I drive down central kickin' the bass. 
Chillin' with my freaks and I'm pickin' her face. 
Maggots and bugs like to crawl on her head. 
Cause my bitch is dead, I'd rather that instead. 
I'm a hoe you can't trust, always diggin' a nut. 
A dead body bitch learned to keep her mouth shut. 
Riding in the back is my dead body crew. 
Only they can never think of nothin' to do. 
If you think I'm sick, take a look at yourself. 
You got dead deer heads up on your shelf. 
On your key chain is a little baby rabbit's hand. 
I'm just the dead body man. 

""We also collect dead bodies! So if you know any dead people, 
or you yourself are planning on dying soon, 
we'll be happy to come to your house and pay cash for it!
We appreciate good, healthy, stiffs for our dinner! WAHOO!""

It's Friday night, dark, scary
Lonely, walking through the park, cemetery
And its foggy, cold and smoggy
Hear a dog, a howling doggy
I'm scared, should of brung the shotgun
Should of, would of, but I ain't got one
So I watch my back, and what's that
The caretaker, a dirty old hunchback
Better run, hide, quick, fast
He's coming for my ass with a shovel
No where to run, nore to hide but the grave bit
So I dove in, I did the dumb shit
Took a fall, deeper than six foot
Down the stairs, hit a floor and through a door
Into a whole new world of stiffs
Bodies, heads, and sexy little dead chicks
Club lights, sounds, bass
DJs spinnin with maggots on they face
And what I saw next then really took me
Uh, they did the headless boogie

[Chorus (2x)]
Hey yo, I heard that you died
Fuck that, it's time to get live
Dead bodies let's all take a ride
Lean to the left and slide (the headless boogie)

""Oh yeah, we dug up the finest 
Bitches in the graveyard
So come on down
And if you ain't come to get your funk out
Then get the fuck out, bitch""

[Violent J]
They all stand straight and swing to the side
No heads, but they feet still glide
Take a step back, twist and dive
I even seen Kurt Cobain get live (blam!)
No heads, but they all funky
And drunk, drinking old Spunky
Don't be shy, everyone's able
Hit the floor, leave your nugget on the table
And kick-step, and when you do kicks off
If you're dead, your legs might fall off
The whole time I can't believe
I can't conceive, I don't want to leave
I'm kicking into a freak with no head
No face, but the rest is straight
She's with it, I hit it like a G
Her back fell off, eww, excuse me
Zombies, mummies, and Frankenstein
Drinkin 'cisco disco dead wine
Dead stiffs coming through the door
Head, speakers, and limbs on the floor
I'm getting drunk, I want to be down, what's up
I want to be the headless clown
They pulled out the jigsaw and got raw
And that ended it all, I did the headless boogie 

[Chorus (2x)]

""Hey yo, fuck that voodoo moshing, bitch
You come and freak it with the real dead juggalos
So come on by and we'll cut your nugget off
So you get grave dancing!!!""

I live my life in the gutter
And this gutter is who I am
Take me back home to my gutter
And I swear I won't ever leave again!

[Violent J]
Hey, I'm coming home 
Home to the criminals and crooks
Home to the gangbangers shooting dirty looks
Home to the killer cops beating on my ass
Home to my '72 Velarick, praying it will last
Pass by the rich bitches trying to play me out
Dawging on my neighborhood, don't know what it's about
So now I'm clockin dunkets, never hang out with the rich
I'd rather hang out with the crooked at the party store, bitch
Give me codey, dawg, with a little smog
'cause it tastes better than the poisonous fog
Seeping from the sewers in my slummy neighborhood
But the ghetto got love and the love is all good
So I don't give a fuck about your mansion by the lake
You can suck my dingaling until your neck breaks
'cause all I want to do is hang with the zombie
In the zone, break out with the Faygo, I'm coming home

[Chorus (1x)]
Home to the creatures, home to the crooks
Home to the fools readin witchcraft books
Home to the monsters roaming the land
I want to come home but ya don't understand

[Shaggy 2 Dope]
Bitch, I'm coming home and I'm not alone
Jokers and freaks, and their dead body bones
Every single thing that you never want to see
Add it all together and you got me
I know nobody gives a fuck about your punk ass rules
Keystone coppers and your hypocrite schools
I'd much rather lay around the streets of the gutter
And make dirty phone calls to your rich mother
Caught her passed midnight and I'm waking up the dead
Then we playin kickball with somebody's head
We got skinny dipping in the barrels of toxic waste
After that I pour myself a little taste
So tell your daughter that she's nothing but a fat bitch
And all my homies don't care if the hoes rich
Somebody out here, please, let me know where there's a phone
I need to call my mother and tell her I'm coming home

[Chorus (1x)]

[Violent J]
And I'm coming home, chicken chicken bones
Sugar prom bushes, and ice cream cones
All these fake people sayin hi to one another
Then they sit around and talk shit about each other
Watering they grass, digging in they ass
Trying to make sure they didn't lose any cash
Working hard, all your life, and now you're finally rich
But look at you, you're just another whack bitch

[Shaggy 2 Dope]
Crawl in the slum that's where I'm from
Murderers and slaughterers, so that's what I've become
Spare a little change 'cause I just ran out of gas
Reach for your quarter and I'll stick your fuckin ass

[Violent J] Nobody wants to be around the ghetto breed
But the ghetto got each other and that's all we really need

[Violent J]
Laying in my bed, I think of many horror tales
Yet I barely move, my bed is made of nails
I try to roll, my skin slowly tears away
My flesh is stuck to my bed as I begin my day
Walking out the house, this morning, the sky is red
The streets are crowded with the bodies of the living dead
They're trying to die, they're leaping off of roof tops
Uh, they only scream in pain as their body flops
I'd rather stay inside my home and only pray to die
But my house is been on fire since like '85
I can only stand a night of the fatal smoke
But see you never die, you only burn and choke
So I leave out the house and walk the land
Wild pigs run and feed off the dying man
And look around you, there's bodies hanging from the trees
But they're not dying, they're only crying ""please""
I hear the thunder in the sky, so I run in hide
The deadly rain may soon come down, you got to get inside
The lunatics see the lightning, they're screaming, yes
It's raining blood, the streets are a bloody mess
About once or twice a week though it thunder storms
That's when giant heavy red and black clouds form
It's raining blood, livers, and kidneys from the sky
Prepare 'cause when you die, you're coming to the killing fields

""What shall that be? What shall that be? When that fine moment
comes. When the curtains are drawn, the windows are shut, the
doors close, and you've written what you've written, you said
it, that's it. What will you look to be? What about it, mister,
when you've had your last beer. You laughed at family and 
laughed at your little wife. She begged you not to go out to
that bar.""

[Violent J]
As I feed off a dead pig, I'm thinking back
To when I had a heart beat, and how I would act
I would steal from the poor, I'd laugh at the sick
But in the killing fields, you get your fucking neck ripped
So as I walk along, I meet a lot of strange folks
Some people with no eyes, and gashed open throats
And if they notice your eyeballs are working well
They try to dig em out your skull, and go for self
Now in the summertime, it's like a whole 'nother realm
Water victims, fire, and oceans overwhelm
To walk outside, the heat will surely cook your brains
Try to run across the street your hair will burst in flames
Victims in a panic run from the heated light
Underneath the city, into the sewer pipes
Into the fire storm this becomes your new land
But there's no food, so you feed off the other men
And now it's been seven months, I'm barely fed
I chase a Billy Billy goat with a human's head
He's steady screaming ""Let me be! Let me be!""
But while I chase him there's another demon chasing me
All of time moves backwards, I'm growing old
And the clouds are burning fire, and so I'm told
That there's a lot of living souls such as the rich
That choose to live like a bitch, I'll see you in the Killing Fields

""You've had your big time of lust and sin and filth. What is
the end going to be when you realize that time is up? You've
crossed the finish line going in the wrong direction. What 
shall it be? What about it, ya man? When you spent your life
in a few years time? You're burned out shell at 25 years of
age. What shall it be? What about it?

You could go to hell (what shall it be?)

And even does my homies if its ok. 
A little bitch that's down with a quicky, I love checky checky. 
I ain't being picky though. So you might be a little bit fat. 
You might even stink a bit, I don't mind that. 
Even if you don't fuck on the first date. 
Just put my nuts in your mouth and I'm straight 
I need a girl that just don't give a fuck.

Who's the dirtiest bitch in the whole town? 
There she go, she workin' at Dairy Queen. 
Bitch couldn't be a day over fifteen. 
So I threw her in the butt like that. 
I hit it so quick, I made her butt cheeks clap. HaHa 
Why wait around 'til she gets married. 
Cause I'm ready as long as her neden's hairy. 
Tootsie, Tootsie, Pumpkin Pie. Oops, looks like you nut in your eye. 
My fault I didn't notice you were still there. 
Now go in and wash that shit out your hair, bitch. 
I want a girl not afraid to bone, 
Even if her mommas and pops is still home. 
And if her daddy suddenly walks in, 
He just might see my nuts on his daughter's chin. 
Everybody in the hood says that your easy. 
You look a little cracked out, a little sleezy. 
Your a basehead, baby, it ain't shit. I'm still down if you down, 
For a Lil' Somethin' Somethin'. Somethin' Somethin' 

[Chorus]

Bitch let me hit, I won't be long As soon as I nut I'm gone. 
(Guess ya don't know.) 
Bitch let me hit, I won't be long As soon as I nut I'm gone. 
(But ya dog did.)

""I loved the old man. He had never wronged me. He had never given me insult. For 
his gold I had no desire. I think it was his eye. Yes  it was this. One of his eyes 
resembled that of a vulture. A pale  blue eye with a film over it. Whenever it fell upon me  my 
blood ran cold. And so  by degrees  very gradually  I made up my mind to take the life of 
the old man and thus rid myself of the eye forever."" 

So I'm headed door to door 
With my grandmother's cookie jar. 
I'm sellin' cookies, 12 for a dollar. 
I ring the doorbell, nobody wants any. 
I resort to goin' cheaper - 2 for a penny. 
Anybody, everybody, they hate me. 
I can tell when they spit and degrade me. 
There's only one house left, the last on the block. 
Old Man Willie on the hilltop. 
I ring the doorbell, the door creeps open. 
And there it was starin' and scopin'. 
The man's left eye, red, big, and drippin' 
I was trippin'. ""Ahh, seeya!"" 
I ran home. I couldn't stop thinking 
About his eyeball winking and blinking. 
And it looked not a damn thing like the other. Ugh! 
Shoulda wore a patch on the motherfucker. 
It hypnotized me, mesmerized me. 
Traumatized, paralyzed, terrorized me. 
Creepers, where'd you get that ball? 
And tell me how it even fits in your skull. 

I want a big long knife to stick it in. 
I want to lift up the eyelid and kick it in. 
He's gotta die. I want his eye buried in my backyard. 
It ain't hard, I'm killin' Old Evil Eye! 

[Chorus]
Evil eye... 
Oh-Oh-Eye (The bitch gon' die! Die-die-die-die-die-die-die) 
Evil eye... 
Oh Oh 

""Now this is the point. You fancy me mad. Madmen know nothing. But you 
should've seen me. You should have seen how wisely I proceeded with caution with 
what 
foresight, with what patience I went to work. I was never kinder to the old man 
than 
during the whole week before I killed him."" 

A day gone pass since I heard about J.O. 
Met up in this sleigh, 'cause I don't fuckin' play. 
Anyway, I gotta do him in. Got a rusty revolver 
Put the silver bullets in. 
I'm plannin' on playin' one right to his nugget. 
Down my drawers with the bucket. 
It's time to go, fuck it. 
I stuck it up... to his neck when he came to the door. 
I really didn't know what I was in for. 
First the cold man stared, no a gaze, no a stare. 
Kinda like there was no one there. 
How weird, my body froze with the blink of his eye. 
Evil eye, sendin' chills up my spine. 
What to do? What to do? I gotta try to break. 
I gotta try to make.. my way to the gate. 
Wait. I can't move, I'm stuck to the ground. 
W-What the fuck was that? I think I heard a sound, 
Turned around, there it was, starin' at my face. 
This little old man's eye's a make me a mental case. 
That's when I felt the pain deep inside, 
Deep inside, now his eye's open wide. 

I want a big long knife to stick it in. 
I want to lift up the eyelid and kick it in. 
He's gotta die. I want his eye buried in my backyard. 
It ain't hard, I'm killin' Old Evil Eye! 

[Chorus]

""That night it ceased. The old man was dead. I placed my hands on the heart and 
there for many minutes there was no pulsation. He was stone dead. His eye will 
trouble me 
no longer. His eye will trouble me no longer.""

Hey, quick, hurry up, bang
Open your mouth 'cause here comes my wang
I'm Violent J, the southwest skitso
Born in a big top, magical mijisto
Dead body disco, rapping to the hoochies
Dirty old fat hoes come up with a smoochie
Hoochie coochie la la la la
I might pull your tongue out your mouth

Three more cards and the sky's will be falling

""Well it all began when I was very young
I was feeling so excited about the carnival's arrival
Everyone was jolly and jittery
I waited for their wagons until well after dusk
That night, while I was sleeping
I was awoken by a cold eerie wind
Looking out, I seen strange men, cursing and filthy
There were clowns setting up the dreary tent""

I'm 2 Dope and I sport tight Wranglers
Don't say a word or I'll kick ya in the neck, bitch
Everybody round make way for the clown
Been to New York and L.A., I'm southwest down
Walked into Del Ray's almost got my ass kicked
Rather just chill in the yard in my casket
Call up the hoes, have em swing by the tomb
And get a little sticky stank up in this bitch 
Killer clowns kicked out the circus
Used to get live, let the midget lady work this
I was a freak show, they called me the Pogo
I could make my ball sac bob like a yo-yo 
Give it up, give it up, southwest looney tune
Killed another redneck, found his head in looney doon
Gooney boon, booney goon, I can hear the loons
In my head as I sing my wicked song
The show must go on!

""I never been afraid of clown
But these clowns were different
There was nothing funny about these clowns but then
They smiled, they juggled, they laughed
But yet something was terribly, terribly wrong
I didn't like these clowns for I could see threw them
I knew what they were really like
I knew that this carnival that had come to my village
Was an evil, evil thing""

Come see the show, big top show
Walk in and hang with the dead carnival
Dead carny carnies, dead juggalos
Walk in and hang with the dead carnival

Do we bang bang, I'm a gangbanger, man
I bang in a gang, man, you can suck my wang, man
Richie boy, richie boy, it's a southwest thang
Serial murderer, southwest maniac
Slaughterer, lunatic, high school braniac
Straight-A school boy, school kid
Till I went to school and tried to murder everyone
The show must go on!

""My neighbors and friends were fools, all of them
Totally unaware of the evilness within the clowns
Their eyes reflected stairways into hell
Their faces painted with blood
I ran from the carnival clowns 
Yet every road and every path 
Led me right back to the big tent
I had no excuse from the strong men, 
The freak show, and the Ringmaster""

""We're sorry the person you are calling is dead""

[Violent J]
I was like six, I used to get dissed by the chicks
And everyone would chase me and hit me with bricks
And rocks and sticks and calling me names
And filled my lunchbox with frogbrains (eeww!)
When I left school, it was much iller
My daddy was a serial killer 
And how about that, he'd always make me sit in the back
With all his dead bodies on my lap (move!)
When I got home, enough of the static
Hammer and tools, went up to the attic
Never knew any other girls or boys
Only my toys, toys, toys
Bang! Clang! Hammer and twist
Nobody knows I exist, and I'm pissed
But I won't be mentally scarred
Instead I make toys, toys of the graveyard
Monday, ringing the bell
It's all about show and tell, might as well
Show all these bastards just what I got
Yo, check out my toy box!

""Nothing feels better than a good harty-harr, right boys and girls""

[Violent J]
We got dead bodies everywhere you look
All the nerds sitting up front got cooked
Others start screaming and making a dash
So I start handing out toys fast at last
You like slinkies, we got slinkies
Only mine like to wrap around your face
And stretch, twist, kazoom
And whip your body all over the fuckin room
So come, one at a time
Open your gift and what you will find
Is a toy, my friend, that you'll never forget
It's not everyday that you get your skull split
You like soldiers, we got soldiers
Made with rubber and steel, they look real
But I wouldn't just toss em under your bed
That's how you get an axe to the forehead (oww)
And don't let em sit around all day
Come home and find you mom, dead in the hallway
'cause they can be nifty
All the toys are shifty, haha, in my toy box

""Woooowee, that sure sounds like fun!""

[Violent J]
That's not a toy, hey, wait a minute
Don't fuck around, homie, you can lose an eye with it
That's my double blade razor whip chop jimmy
And it's mine, motherfucker, so gimme gimme
You want toys, you come to the right place
Try my little toy, Mutilating Mental Case
Wind him up, let him go among all of ya
Then BANG! serial slaughterer
Your turn, reach in and get lucky
Oh look, he pulled out a rubber ducky
It make a funny sound and then BANG! 
Blew the fingers off his fuckin hand
Don't stop, class ain't done yet
I remember you calling me poindexter
Bookworm brainy, my aggrevation
Went into these little creations
Reach in, you might find something wicked
Wicked, scary, chop bang pickadery
Off with your head, a robot with a sword
But now he's looking at me, but what for?

Get them, not me. Eh, wait a minute, motherfucker.""

I can remember the first time I had a taste
She pulled her panties down
And shoved her Cotton in my face
I said ""Your daddy's home""

I tried to push it in
I couldn't turn it out

Run like a bitch
Or have the Cotton Stew
I thought for a moment
Then I said ""What The Fuck!""
I ate so much Cotton that my tongue came out her butt

Another morning, I must get up and go to school 
I'm taking too long gettin dressed, tryin to look my best 
Because today is not your ordinary every morning 
My high school prom is coming and I heave my daddy's warnings 
I'm going to find myself a girl to take to the prom 
I shouldn't have too much trouble because I'm 
I'm very nice, my mother says I'm very handsome 
When I wear my good vest, and mother knows best 
I got to school, I straggle through the hallways 
I stop and gaze at all the girls just like always 
But this time, I must now approach them (or) 
Or my daddy might get mad and break my wrist again (ow) 
And so I chose her, her hair, it matches with her face 
She is so lovely, my heart pulse begin to race 
I make my way between her friends and to her presence 
Hello, Christine, would you be my prom queen? 
I'd rather die, I'd rather die, I'd rather die... (repeat over) 
(would you be my prom queen? no! aaah! prom queen) 
There was a time when I could except a no 
That was before, Christine is gonna have to go 
My parents will be proud of me when I bring her home 
So now I sit and watch her practice in the gym dome 
Christine is famous, she has so many different friends 
Will they miss her when she's dead or will they just pretend 
Nobody talks to me, I only talk to I 
And I been telling myself all day, she's gotta die 

""Good morning, everybody. This is Principal Rogers, and I would just 
like to congradulate our Senior class and wish them at tonight's 
Prom dance."" 

Won't you be my prom queen? (I can be your prom baby) 
Won't you be my prom queen? 
Everybody has a real good time 

It was really fuckin easy, I'm a human hater 
I took a towel from the locker room to suffocate her 
I had to throw away her gym bag and all her folders 
And when it got dark, I caried her home on my shoulders 
My daddy was asleep, when I snuck her in the back 
I thought about my situation and it's kind of whack 
It sounds cheap, but we're having prom in my cellar 
But she's dead, I guess I'll never have to tell her 
I took the bottles of Tamiace, four dollars worth 
I took the seventeen dollars that was in her purse 
I bought balloons and streaming and stuff to munch 
I had a dollar left, I bought a Faygo Punch 
I hung the streamers and balloons on my basement wall 
I banged my head a couple times, I'm just too fuckin tall 
I would have took her to the school like a normal man 
But I had to kill her first they'd never understand 
I put a record on and then I picked her up to dance 
I bet she cannot feel the woody growing in my pants 
I know my daddy would be proud of all that I've done 
Instead of burning me, he'd probably come and hug his son 
I think about it as I dance slowly to the beat 
The more I think about it tears are rolling down my cheek 
I hope I showed Christine a night like no other 
After all, that's how my daddy did my mother

all their great work. Prom night is your very own special night,

You're running on stumps motherfucker!!!""

Well, moonlight fills the room that you sleep in
Things go bump in the night, me creeping
Ouch! Fuck! I stubbed my toe
If you'd just quit leaving your shit all over the fucking floor
Fuck it, you're dead anyway

Well, is your mother a bald-headed freak bitch? yes
You fall asleep and you wake up dead
With a broken broom sticking out your forehead
I sing lullabies till you dose off
Tie you down and chew your fuckin toes off
And then spit em out back in your face
Splat! Fuck, wash your feet bitch!

""The world's famous Boogie Woogie Wu will come to you
Slumber parties, sleepovers, intimate nights
What the occasion for the midnight hour
He will gladly come and fuck that shit up""

I don't beat woman, fuck that, I'm above it (no no)
But I'll cut her fucking neck and think nothing of it
""I bet you didn't know the Boogie Man was a clown
But when you see the juggla, your holding your jugular""
With a swing, chop, stab, swing, chop
You're holding your neck together, but your nuts drop
And the cops do the best they can
They pull the axe out your face and say
""Was it the Boogie Man?""

""It's the incredible, undeadable Boogie Man
Go ahead, pull the covers over your head
Hide under them, he don't give a fuck
It'll just make it that much more easier
For him to suffocate your face!""

There's three ways to stop me from doing what I do
What? you think I'm a tell you
""Mom, can you leave the door open a bit?""
Thanks, an easy way in, you fucking idiot
Now I stretch your neck out and play in like a banjo

[Shaggy 2 Dope]
I got shot, ah!, the murder was heinous 
The bullet went in my eyeball and out my anus 
And I was hit, that was it, on the spot 
Flash, I woke up in a parking lot 
And I'm sittin in a '64 Reinkeys 
With Shaggy Dope written on the car keys 
I look around I can't believe that it's possible 
I'm dead, and I made it to the carnival 
I walk in, it's everything I dreamed of 
Everybody and they momma got clown luv 
Japanese, Lebanese, and Chinese, 
Portuguese, and southwest ghetto g's. (woowoo) 
Hangin' out with redneck truck drivers 
Instead of always givin' each other piledrivers 
I see my old homey, he died in a drag
Chillin with two bitches, ""What up, Shaggs?"" 
And he passed me a blunt like a tree trunk 
I tried to hit it, but couldn't even fuck with it
And to think, I always been afraid to die 
But I ain't never goin back to wonder why. 

[Chorus (2x)]
We all gonna die, but I'm not gonna fry
Even though most never try
I'm not gonna let this pass me bye, no

[Violent J]
I was born, first, they threw me in a shit pile 
I dealt with it, and lived there for a while 
I got dissed on, pissed on, and beat down
Mutilated, and tossed out a dead clown 
Next thing ya know, I'm chillin' at the big top 
Free money, and mad bitches non-stop 
No water, it's Faygo on tap 
I wash my hair, and my face, and my butt-crack with it
'cause I can, 'cause I'm phat paid 
I got a five story funhouse with a maid 
And she walks around with her titties hanging out 
And when I cough, she come and dust my balls off (woowoo) 
I'm headed up to the show, I'm gonna see 
Jimi Hendrix, Selena, and Eazy E 
Elvis tried to open up but got dissed off 
We got pissed off, because he sounded like butt 
There's no fights, it's a perfect match 
Hillbillies in the crowd tryin' to cabbage patch 
And to think, I've always been afraid to die 
But I ain't never goin back to wonder why. 

[Chorus (2x)]

[Violent J]
Did ya ever burn your finger on somethin? hey 
Well picture this, your nuts burnin that way
And a roman candle stickin' in your butthole 
That's where the greedy skank motherfuckers go 

[Shaggy 2 Dope]
This is all hell now, we livin' in it 
But this bullshit'll be over in a minute 
Then it's off to the Faygos and neden hoes 
New clothes, and patent leather for your toes (woo-woo) 

[Violent J]
And while you sit around cryin' for your dead friend 
He's chillin' up there, paid, getting mad ends 
He's probably there tryin to figure out why you're sad
He's on the beach gettin' fat, you got it bad 

[Shaggy 2 Dope]
And for those who ain't down for the next man 
Who rob from the poor, and snatch all ya can 
And any chicken talkin' shit, lemme tell ya something 
Hold a lighter to your balls, and you'll see what's coming

[Chorus (2x)]

""Does this excite you? Think about it! Does it not stagger the 
imagination? No builder on earth can concieve any structure to compare 
to the mansions above. Won't that be something when you go to live 
in your own mansion? There'll be no concern about paying for it, 
it's already taken care of. There'll be no worry about veing moved out

Insane Clown Posse,"""Come and get it! Woo! 
We got some fresh fills for your fat chicken-ass to snack on, bitch! 
So here, start with a slice of this fresh piggy pie, motherfucker!""

The first little piggy, his house is made of wood 
He lives in a chicken turkey piggy neighborhood
He likes to fuck his sister, and drink his moonshine 
A typical redneck filthy fuckin' swine 
I rode into town with my axe in my holster 
Everybody knows about the wicked piggy roaster 
A farmer at the border, he tried to take me out 
I drew my ax with the quickness, and cut his chicken feathers out 
Walked in the village, and to the piggy's place 
He opened up his door, and popped me in the face 
And blew me off the porch, and cracked my head in half 
But I'm a Juggalo, so it only made me laugh (he he) 
Forty in hand, I rose from the dead 
And threw with all my might, I made a ping noise off his head 
Since we out west, I had a little fun
And pulled his fuckin tongue out the back of his cranium

[Chorus]
Three little piggies, to make a piggy pie 
There's nothing like the sound when you hear a piggy die 
I might use a gun (no), I might use an ax (yes) 
The carnival's in town, come and get your piggy snacks!

The second little piggy, his house is made of brick 
And this little piggy is a motherfucking dick 
He sits on his bench and gets all the respect 
But if I get a chance, I'm goin' straight for the neck 
He walked in the room, and everybody rose 
Lopped off bucket chillin' underneath my clothes
First they let the piggy, now you can finally sit 
But what this piggy don't know is he's about to get his neck wet 
Now I see the bailiff, I'm thinkin' what the fuck?
I can smoke this room before his hearing aid will pick it up 
Old-ass man, I let him get away 
That tired motherfucker will probably die tomorrow anyway 
Here come the piggy, it's time for my case 
His eyes are blood red with a wicked lookin' face 
He saw my joker's smile, and sentenced me to die 
So I ragged on the bucket, made it fuckin' rain pork rinds

[Chorus: x2]

The last little piggy, his house is made of gold 
He lives in a mansion on his own private road
I started walking down it, the guard he told me wait 
I bounced off his head and did a Jackie Chan over the gate
Cause this little piggy, must definitely fry 
I'm a lop his nugget off and toss it in the sky 
And then I watch the moon take the form of the devil 
And pull it out the sky, and beat it with a shovel 
People in my city, they fightin' for they meals 
He sleeps on a mattress stuffed with hundred dollar bills 
How rich he is the devil, he never will admit it 
So I'm a take his money stack and stuff his face with it 
Opened up his door, he's sleeping in his bed 
I grabbed a brick of gold and laid it upside his head 
He begged for his life, I told him it's too late 
And took away his dough and watched the devil suffocate
Cause I need

Voodoo, runnin' from my magic

Brain insane, ??????
Southwest voodoo's in the haugh!
Wicked voodoo, dope dark killer
Magic, dark magic

Met this kid named Louie Lou
He thought he could fuck with this voodoo
So I turned his head into a lima bean
And then flicked it off his shoulders

From Mookan House to Shangra La
Egyptian Pharaoh, coompata
Follow me, and join us as we pray
To the seventeen moons of Coonga Del Ray

Walked in the lunchroom chantin' spells
With bamboo bitches and voodoo bells
Got my own food, who wants some?
I got possum nipples and raccoon tongue

A non-believer once started to laugh
So I launched a fireball up his punk-ass
Then everybody heard him squeal
""This voodoo shit's for real!""
It just takes...

A handful of neden, a wing from a bat
A tongue from a snake, a tail from a rat
A neck from a chicken, an eye from a crow
And a little itty bitty little drip of Faygo

Hey! J! What's in the bag?

A shrunken head, and shriveled scrotum sac
Why? Ya think voodoo's fake?
Come to the graveyard, I'll make the dead wake

Sleep no longer, raise, quick
Raise, raise, shooga-boom ba,
Leave us alone, you fuckin' punk bitch!""


Well, fuck it, I ain't that good yet
But one day you can bet I'm a freak

[Violent J]
I was just a child but you seemed like so much more
The way you would avenge me and drift across the floor
I'd see you in the hall, and you'd kiss me with a smile
I never understood it, was I even worth your while?
The others kids at school, they would hate me and they'd spit
'cause I was just a no one, to them I wasn't shit
But you would always help me and stand there by my side
We were only seventeen, we'd be together till we died
But then it all happened on the ever dreadful day
Somebody tried to rape you and now I'll make him pay
You pointed him out to me, my thoughts began to race
I took my daddy's forty-five and shot him in the fucking face!!!
I did it all for you, and though I'm facing years
I would do the time just to equal all your tears
The last thing that you told me when I left the courtroom
Is that we'd always be together, 'cause we're both under the moon

[Chorus (1x)]
I'll forever love you, even if you're doomed
We'll always be together 'cause we're both under the moon

I sit here in my cell and the walls are made of stone
I justified your pain, but now I sit alone
I write another letter, I write one every day
I never got a letter back, I write em anyway
I try to call collect, your number has been changed
I'm staring at the lightbulb and I start to feel the rage
You never came to visit me, I sit facing the glass
No one's on the other side, now it's in the past
My head is always spinning, I'm pounding at the wall
I feel like I'm forgotten, no sign of you at all
You're probably getting married, you're probably getting fucked
I'll break out of this cage and try to cut that motherfucker up
I curl up in the corner, my body will corrode
My teeth are turning into dust, skin is growing mold
I'm staring at the window of my eternal doom
I know that you are out there, somewhere underneath the moon

[Chorus (1x)]

Many, many years, many more to go
Does she still remember? God, he only know
I know become a savage, they chain me to a wall
I still can see your body, I still can hear your call

The world it doesn't want me, my dignity is tossed
And to the girl for whom I feel this doom

With a stiff hangin' out the back

Bitch you wouldn't know shit about that, that was one thing that I hate
It's always been hard for me to find a date
'Cuz I sure was nice and neat, then I strangle 'em in the back seat
'Cuz if you know the Shaggs ain't soft, if you don't like it you can, fuck off

What's up? Violent J The Southwest Juggala
You know what I'm sayin'?
I walk into a bitches house walk up to they moms
Grab 'em by the face and say, fuck off

Suck my nuts, bitch fuck you
You and your Momma can suck my dick
Suck my nuts, bitch fuck you

Please stomp on my head 'cuz it's on fire
I got another funky rhyme so let me kick it
Nah, fuck off bitch this is my record

I walk up like a mental case
And start throwin' left hooks at your face
I won't mix no rap with rock and roll
Like somebody else I know

Bitch boy you can suck my sack
An' after that you can kiss my ass crack
And freaks, you ain't all that
Titties ain't shit but sacks are fat, bitch

'Cuz if you really wanna know what I think
I think your neden stank like a fish tank
So in the early cracks of dawn
Taken two fat sacks of shit and get the fuck on

Best leave me a dollar for Faygo, bitch
Or I'm a have to bust you in your fuckin' lips
Next time you think I'm soft
I hope you remember to, fuck off

Suck my nuts, bitch fuck you

What's your pleasure?

(1st Verse- Violent J)
Fat Sweaty Betty, the bitch ain't nothing new
Her moms used to babysat me back when we was two
We'd go to the playground and to the skating rink
And we'd go under the bleachers and she'd let me hit the stank, well uh
She moved across town and never came back
Until the other day, I seen her at the Chicken Shack
She said her name was Betty, I can't believe this shit
The sexy little girl is now a fat sweaty beeitch
She said, ""Hey, J, tell me how you've been?""
She had a piece of chicken gizzard stuck to her chin
I told her, ""Hold still,"" and flicked it off her face and said,
""Betty, oh, Betty, what you say we leave this place?""
I took her back to the crib and hit it all night
I let my fingers run across the rip of cellulite
EWW! It was nasty, but I don't let it bother me
She rolled over, fucking knocked the wind out of me
I couldn't breathe, she wouldn't stop, I'm almost dead
I took the lamp, and bust it on her fucking head
We got dressed, I gave her a little kiss goodbye
Fat Sweaty Betty, My fat sweaty pumpkin pie

(Chorus)
Fat Sweaty Betty
Tell me when you're ready (x2)


(2nd Verse- Shaggy2Dope)
Big fat slop of shit people call Betty
Flabs of fat on her back, her neck...sweaty
Boogers running down her nose all over her lips
Can't tell the difference from her titties to her hips
But fuck all that, 'cause I want to see the neden
I had to see the cat, the cheesey cheena cheden
Rode my bike to her house, ""Hey yo, Betty lemme in
I'm packing some snack cakes, bitch lemme in.""
I can hear her coming down the stairs
She opened up the door in her motherfucking underwears
UUGGHH!! Shit, fuck that I'm turning back
But no, the door shut, and she's going for the cake snacks
I said, ""Relax, hoe, I'm here, I'm bu-si-ness
you can have the candy, first you gotta wait a bit
I need a favor, come on, Betty, drop them drawls.""
AHH!! I knew it, Betty had balls
Oh, no, here comes that ass

I wish I never came, oh boy do I wish

Put my hands around his neck and tried to put it in a brace
But a nope, that's not how the shit goes
His head popped off and started nibblin on my toes

I got dead bodies to the left
I thought the cary one, but what about the rest?
Tie me up with some veins dragen me into the tomb
I knew I had to be doomed

(Chorus)
Fuck! Damnit! Another Halloween
People on Military know what this means
Houses on fire, they're blowin up cars
Creatures in the streets, and razor blades and candy bars

I went to trick-or-treat the first house on my block
Spit in my face and gave my a rock
I tried to give it back and said ""I'll take nothing instead""
Turned around and walked away and felt the rock peg me in the head

Walked to the next house directly next door
There I saw an old lady dead on the floor
I said ""Excuse me miss, but do you have a treat?""
She lifted her leg and scrapped flakes off her dead feet

I ran to the next house happy and giddy
And there I seen a fat woman holding up her titty
I said, ""Trick-or-treat."" she sad ""Treat-or-trick.""
And squeezed on her titty until it.....fuck it, that's too sick

Next house up was sittin back in the woods
I was a lil frightened but fuck I want the goods
I knocked on the door I heard a knock back
And then I heard ""COME ON IN"" and yo I'm like FUCK DAT

This house belongs to Mrs. Cherry Spoon
She said, Drop your drawers and your treat is coming soon
I quickly grew a stiffy, but kept my eyes shut
A hand came out the mail chute and flicked me in the nuts

I wobbled to the next house ready for the worst
And chillin in the drive was a long black hurst
I rang the door bell and said Is anybody home
Of course little biy have a sugar coated kidney stone

I walked throught the field, and to the next crib
Her friendliness could only be in her cooking bib
I said ""How bout some candy."" she said How bout instead,
A nice hot fresh home made loaf of yeast infection bread

My bag's gettin heavy so I rest on the curb
And riding on his bike her comes little Larry Shurb
I snuck up behind him and kicked him off his seat
I punched him in the neck, and power bombed him in the street

Now my bag of candy has doubled in size
Up to the next house for my scary prize
I'm like trick-or-treat, trick treat tricky dick
He opened up his door slapped my lips and didn't give me shit

Rock through his window and ran across the street
To the Dayton Mansion I'm in for a treat
I dinged on the dong, and here comes the butler
A big gumpy tall ass lurch lookin motherfucker

I said Hello Mr. is there somethin for my sack
He reached in his pocket but I think he hurt his back
It's taking him an hour, my bag is open ready
But then he finally dropped it in my sack, a fucking penny

The next house is abandonded so forget it
But wait a minute, I think somebody's livin in it
I ran up to the door ""Trick-or-treat, you can't hide""
It was a crackhead, he crawled in my bag and died

The next house is mine the last on the block
My mother's sitting on the porch shining up her glock
I climbed on the roof with my brother Jump Steady
And we yelled ""HAPPY HALLOWEEN AND CLOWN LOVE!"" to the whole city

Grippin' my wing wong, something's wrong

Pull his plugs out and start chokin'
Eww, his necks already broken

He swung, hit me wit' a bed pan
I was just makin sure you ain't dead man
Fuck this, I grabbed a scalpel
And stick it down in his scalp, uuh

Calm down, he's dead now, fuck
Here comes somebody, better duck
Gotta hide dead Jimmy quickly

With his fist commin straight for your spine

I'm falling down the stair case, tumble to the floor
I land up in the attic, next to the cellar door
I'm play with the pigons, they tell me many lies
They tell me I'll have wings if I let them peck my eyes

I hear a womans voice calling from the dirt
I plat my little seed, and slowly she will spurt
And now she is a tree, I hear the heart pound
I take her in my arems, and we make love to the sound
The wind is my ebony blowing evil thoughts
Carrying the demons soring with the hearts
I put it in my body, the wind will bring the rain
Only lay it's demon egg, deep inside my brain
They're calling me a killer, I can't say that I'm not
My daddy's tried to kill me ever since I was a tot
By poisoning my bottle, I feed it to my friend
'cause if he dies my buddy our friendship will never end
I'm sitting with the darkness, talking to the dark
It's singing lullabies, and stringing on the harp
I notice that the floor is warm and rather sick
It's 'cause I'm sitting in my stomach

I was stabbed in the head
Look what ya done dead
All the blood bleed, one juggalo dead
It was a cold, dark, scary Halloween
So my neighbors and my people,
they didn't really like me right?
So they came and burn down my world
Just because I like to murder their boys and girls
It was the Halloween I never ment to harm no one
I thought you were supposed to murder it was all in fun
I see the monsters and the gobblins I'm a killer to
But then they call me sick so what was I supposed to do?

Milky bar with the delicious razor blade filling
I got fudge freshly packed from the worlds rarest fudge packer

Must return to the other side
But not before I take these bitches on a murder ride
Murder go round the dead body clown
Put the treats in your mouth, and swish it around
Excuse me little boy, but is your daddy home?
Thank you sonny here's a little treat now run along
Hey buddy, you thought I was dead, man

Insane Clown Posse,"Once upon a time there were three little pigs
Who went out into the big world
To build their homes and seek their fortunes.

The first little piggy, his house is made of wood
He lives in a chicken turkey piggy neighborhood
He likes to fuck his sister and drink his moonshine
A typical redneck filthy fuckin' swine!
I rode into town with my axe in my holster
Everybody knows about the wicked piggy boaster
The sherrif at the border, he tried to take me out
I drew my axe with the quickness-and cut his adam's apple out!
Walked in the village and to the piggy's place
He opened up his door and shot me in the face
And blew me off the porch-and blew my head in half
But I'm a Juggalo so it only made me laugh (ha ha!)
Axe in hand, I rose like the dead
And swung with all my might- made a thump noise in his head
Since we out west, I grabbed a shotgun
And blew his fuckin tongue out the back of his cranium!!

[Chorus:]
Three little piggies, to make a piggy pie
There's nothing like a sound when you hear a piggy die
I might choose a gun (NO!)
I might choose an axe (YES!)
The carnival's in town- come and get your piggy snacks

The second little piggy, his house is made of brick
And this little piggy is a mother fuckin dick
He lays down his rules and reads you your rights
In that funny lookin car with the little blinkin lights
I drive a Volkswagen Bug seventeen deep
Packed fulla Juggalos, lights out and we creep
To the piggy station and lay on the horn
First piggy out- we blow his lungs out his uniform
Now they in pursuit like Starsky and Hutch
But there's only two of them-the rest are out to lunch
They call up Dunkin Donuts to gather up the rest

It's Christmas, time for a slaughter
Maybe your wife, maybe your daughter
It's midnight, I land my sleigh
Make way for jolly St. J
Climb down the chimny, for the murder
Dressed as the fat man everyones heard of
Shimy down, shimy down, what the fuck?
Somebody help me, I'm stuck
Now what to do? I feel whack
I got stuck in a chimny stack
But I hack, and shimmer on down
Santa Claus Clown
Can't fuck around, now
Livingroom, shhh, I creep
Tippy toes 'cause they asleep
I pulled out the axe and slid down the hall
I got a gift for all of ya'll
what's that? I better hide quick
Oh fuck, it's the real St. Nick
And he musta been taken a shit
But regardless, I better move quick, now
So I jumped him, Santa's no joke
Fucked around got my damn neck broke
He strap, he shot, he didn't miss

Jack Frost nibbles, he but fuck that
I ain't got a home so he nibbles on my nutsack
And my buttcrack, toes, and elbows
My nutz is froze, fuck you hoes
So I made a friend like me, a snow man
He was down with the clown like a blow man
Had a hat and eyes outta charcoal
And a pipe, we fill it with indow
Me and him sang songs in the snowflakes
He ate snowballs, I ate cornflakes
And we both would freeze are ballz off
I was there every time his head fallz off
I put it back on for him with a smile
He was my boy, made from a snow pile
Then the storm came, a blizzard
Snow, wind, ice, a blizzard
We pulled through we hid in an alley
The next day it was like sunny valley
He was meltin I was just fine
He got pissed and pulled out a nine

""If I'm gonna die you should come with me
'cause we boyz"" (gunshot) It hit me
Damn I'm dying, I'm dead he got his wish
And all I got was another red christmas

Of a punk ass motherfucker who thought he was the shit. 
Turns out  he was the shit  a piece of shit. 
You see  this young hooligan wasn't afraid to die 
So he put his life on the line to gain respect in his neighborhood. 
Well the only respect he gets now 
Is from the maggots and worms that are snacking on his dead ass.

Life is over, death devour 
Time has come for witching hour 

Time for your family to dress up in black 
Time for your coffin to ride in the back 
Time for your enemies to laugh at your death 
Time for the vultures to pick at what's left 
Time for your homeboy to find a new clique 
Time for your girlfriend to suck a new dick 
Time for your brothers to fight over your car 
Time for the world to forget who the fuck you are

Close your eyes, hold your breath, release the stress 
let it out there's nothing left 'cause you're facing death 
If you see God, send my blessings if He's up there 
And tell that man how you spent your life here 
Bust around the street, diesel smoke from the heat 
And you're feeling weak, 'cause the lead got you going to sleep 
It's getting deep, know your peeps? They gon' fuck your freak 
In between the sheets in they face they drop the leaky leak 
You hear the sirens, think about who was firing 
See your partner blurry from the spark of the iron 
Holding on to faith, want to survive to retaliate 
Here comes the Reaper, it's Grim Reaper at your door awaits 
Can you feel it? Pumping on your inner spirit, 
Got you screaming out for Mommy Dearest 
You want to live, keep on twitching, bluff spitting 
Time ticking it's the hour for the witching 

(Quit crying like a bitch, and die like a man, motherfucker!)

Time for you to lay dead while everybody stares 
Time for the Reverend to front like he cares 
Time for your body to rot in your tomb 
Time for your sister to finally get your room 
Time for your picture to fade on the wall 
Time for your crew to hang out at the mall 
Time for your boys to beat hoes and kick bass 
While you sit in the dark, with maggots crawling on your face 

(Put 50 more cc's in that IV and start CPR, I'm still not getting anything)

Bitches are backstabbers, or your inner friend bank grabbers 
Reaching out just to get fatter 
Thoughts of your soon-to-be wife and your phat ride 
She's in the back seat, catching it from the backside 
You wish you had some rum, feeling numb 
Where the noise at? Losing it, where my boys at? 
Hallucinate seeing caskets, your son a soon to be bastard 
'cause you slipped and got blasted 
Your ?? lies in your good times, 
Ambulance 59 minutes later, now you're on a respirator 
Get on this shit, you're losing consciousness 
Man flashing, in your phat ride crashing 
Unhappy family and it's costing black roses 
Beer on the concrete, bones in your coffin 
That's all you get, a lost soul on the trip 
Times up, clock ticked, hour to be witched 

(Looking at my Gucci, it's about that time, motherfucker)

[Chorus: x4] 

Time to sit and cry about the fact that you're gone 
Time to say fuck it, Nitro is on 
Time for your people to clean out your place 
Time for you love to go through your tin case 
Time for your father to feel a little stress 
Time for you step-dad to give a fuck less 
Time for the world to keep spinning around 
Even with you dead in the ground, motherfucker! 

Time for your family to dress up in black 
Time for your coffin to ride in the back 
Time for your enemies to laugh at your death 
Time for the vultures to pick at what's left

Time for your girlfriend to suck a new dick

As the seething masses turn to witness him growing near
Their eyes attempt to make out his face forming within the looming smoke
Suddenly, bang! Like a continuous explosion, he moves down upon them full of thunderous fury,
Enveloping the masses in darkness
Then, pow! A deep, resonating explosion of unparalleled intensity
Those still alive begin to feel a warm rain upon their charred skin, 
Which they soon realize is the blood of the shredded victims
They can only lay screaming in pure, stark terror, when boom! 
An earthshaking implosion of catastrophic proportions erupts,
Causing all to collapse inward into a finite point of brilliant, horrific energy
You may call him ""Bang! Pow! Boom!""

I mean I hear what you're saying, I mean
You got carried away in the moment
And I could forgive you
I could do that
I could do anything, if I want to

(1st Verse- Violent J)
I could buy you a Lexus truck with a white leather interior
I could kill off some bears and dogs and shit just to make you a fur coat
I could love you and treat you with class
And have babies falling all out your ass
But thinking about that...
I feel I'd rather kill you
['cause I got you in my car, and you ain't going nowhere bitch, you're dead]

(Chorus x2- Violent J)
I'd rather cut that neck in half
I'd rather choke out that bitch-ass
I'd rather chop and never stop
Because you fucked my homies

I could take all the face paint off and get a real job working for Dad
I would rather take a ten-pound axe and stick it in your daddy's forehead
I could let you move into my house
You'd fuck the neighbors every time I'd go out
And wipe his nut on my pillow [oh]
But I think I'd rather kill you
['cause we parked all alone and it's real dark anyway, hey]

(Chorus)

(3rd Verse)
I'm the one that killed your precious cat, and stuffed him in your fucking 
mailbox
If I only hadn't cut off my hair, I'd choke you with all my dreadlocks
When I strain at the moon every night [Heh heh!]
You shouldv'e known something just ain't right
'cause I'm gonna slap you
And the I'm going to kill you
['cause the moon told me to, and it's watching us right now]

(4th Verse)
I could go back to school instead and try to get my diploma
I'd much rather bang your head on the wall, until you fall into a coma
'cause I can't get you out of my head
I'd cut my head off but the I would be dead
And I ain't the only motherfucker that's dying!
So let's just die togetherrrrrraaaaaagghhh!!!

(1st Verse- Violent J, (Shaggy2Dope), [Monoxide Child], {Jamie Maddrox})
Imagine a place that exists beyond, a place that's seldom seen
[A place that even the wickedest souls that burned have never been]
{There was a soul named Damien, he was nothing heaven could save}
[Instead he was cast to the flames of Hell to serve an eternal grave]
(Even in the Afterlife, things don't always go as planned)
[As Satan's throne sees ??, it's hectic and over jammed]
{Damien burned his spot in hell right until his dying day}
So the wagons took his sorry soul and taunted him all the way
[They finally reached that resting place, an endless pit of fire]
(But Damien had escaped through the back door of Satan's lair)
[Out the back entrance of hell but with nowhere else to hide]
His hell is just a tomb, resting in the Echo Side.

(Chanting x2)
Underneath the shadows of the other side of time
If there is a hell then there must be a behind
You can take me to the ghetto land move everything and back
Take me from the Echo Side and never bring me back


(2nd Verse- Violent J, (Shaggy2Dope), [Monoxide Child], {Jamie Maddrox})
Damien ran as far as he could before his legs began decaying
[There were many dead trees, a blood red sky, and headless children playing]
(A wicked man with a long black toungue saw Damien's legs were dead)
So he laid on top of Damien, and then licked the back of his neck and said...

""Fuck the Devil, fuck that shit.
 We will leave this life legit.
 If you're hearing what we say, 
 why youu throw your soul away?"" - Save me from the darkest corner (4X)

(3rd Verse- Violent J, (Shaggy2Dope), [Monoxide Child], {Jamie Maddrox})
{Damien called for many hours, in puddles of blood he lay}
Tortured by everything he saw, yet wishing along the way
[His arms decayed and fell off his body as he rolled along the floor]
{Still trying not to look back, as if something else was in store}
(The clouds above were dark and hot yet dripping with blood rain)
[The ground infested with rodents, that crawled throughout his veins]
{As Damien laid in Echo Side, Hell's screams could still be heard}
The blood red sky would flicker with the tourturing that occurred
(Thinking back, he had escaped; every scream he heard he laughed)
The headless children pointed and urinated in his wrath
[He finally saw some fortress gates, so he quickly rolled into it]
These red gates were the front doors of hell...he never knew it. heh heh

Taurus, born in 1775
I'm like 300 and something, but I'm still alive
I used to hang with the original billy the kid
You prob'ly think I'm only playing but, I did
My daddies were a two headed freak show
Momma, a fortune teller, esmarelda zella
Anyway they had sex on a ouiji board
And I was born the next day, violent j
When I was 14, I tripped on the train track
And I was crushed right there on the steel rack
I'm out cold, they thought it had fucked me up
I got up and itched my butt, I'm like, ""what?""
Everybody tripped and called me the clown devil boy
Child of the witch heffer, whatever
Tied me up, burned me and threw stones
Had a few scrapes and cuts, smokey nuts
After that they started bowing and shit
Praying at me, you know how them primitives get
I said, ""get off my dick, I ain't a savior,
I'm what you call a juggalo and all I want is my flavor

I want a rusty axe
I wanna know voodoo

And a little sip of faygo, too
'till I get my shit, in this motherfucker I won't never die!

So anyway
50 years pass, all my homies are old ass fucks
I ain't even got hair on my nuts
I left the village in search of my ends
I wrestled alligators, battled terminators
Nothing ever killed me, nothing could harm me
I fought in the civil war, yankees army
I walked across enemy lines with a mack-10

Man, they didn't even have that shit back then

How you just gonna come in my shit and fuck it up?

Well at least make this shit sound real, man, damn!

I walked across enemy lines with a, lantern
Steady taking cannon balls, to the balls
The war ended, I traveled the country horseback
Until this fool tried to horsejack
He put his gat to my head and blew my face up
(Pow) it didn't even smear the make-up
I took his gun and put a tivet in his neck
Sheriff didn't like it, I got indicted
87 long years in the state pen
Until they finally forgot why they put me in
They had to let me go they can't hold me on nothing
On the way out they're like, ""yo, ain't you like 100 and something?""
I said, ""that's right, and I ain't gonna die
'till I get my shit, motherfucker!""

I want a rusty axe
I wanna know voodoo

And just a little sip or two, 
'Till I get my shit, in this motherfucker I won't never die!

Climbed the mountains, searched the alleys
More years passed, and I still ain't died
Now I'm in detroit on the southwest side

Last night we hit the road pushing 111
I stuck my head out the window, told him floor up the most
And let my nugget ping off a light post
Ha ha ha! hell yeah 'cause
Hurts a little bit, but then you get a straight buzz
The world hates me 'cause of shit like this
They always try to kill me but miss
I know it's odd that my face is forever painted
When I was born, the bitch-ass doctor fainted
My toungue's a little long, I choke people with it
Looks kinda nasty, but chicks dig it
And I told ya my neck can stretch for miles
I look like something from 'the x-files'
People wanna see me die more than a little bit
But I'm a juggalo, and as a juggalo I want my shit!
And I ain't gonna die, till I get it!

They had a science lab in the basement

You might play with me at first, a couple days, a week at tops
Just like your Atomic Supersonic Retro Plasma Car
We will all get tossed inside just like the piece of shit we are
I will be your fantasy imaginary special friend
I can fill you ?? with you no need to talk to them
But instead you toss me in the box, leave me to rott away
Hoping you'll pick me again someday...hey, hey

(Chorus- Violent J)
Why don't you come play with me and take me to the other side[take me to the 
other side]
Lost under Ann Raggedy it's lonely when your locked in side [It can be so 
lonley] (x2)

(2nd Verse- Violent J)
I will sit and listen to your bibble babble jibber talk
But when you go in tonight you'll leave me out here on the walk
You'll ignore your little friend or trade me for something instead
Please come get your doggie, don't let him chew up my fucking leg
All your mom and daddy do is work and fight, that's all they do!
I can understand the way you feel because I feel it to
But you'll leave me in the box and I can barley hear you play
Lost umong the toys of yesterday, hey[hey]hey[hey]hey

(3rd Verse- Violent J)
I can see you near the bed when I look through this tiny crack
You become much older now and I don't see you turning back
Seven years in darkness I can only hope my wish comes true
That one day I'll get you in my hands...AND I'LL PLAY WITH YOU!!

This is my sidekick  Fat Pat 
He goes ""Ha ha ha ha""  and all a that (That's right!) 
Anyhow  on my way here I almost died 
This bitch in front of me was like a hundred and five 
They worry about drunks, and late night truckers 
Old ass bitches try to kill motherfuckers (Ha ha ha ha) 
This lady's got her left blinker on for an hour or more 
Then she makes a right into my side door 
This comedy shit's gettin' old 
The game is to be sold, not to be told 
Oh yeah, you can feel the excitement right? 
Snoop dogg is with us tonight 
That's what I'm sayin' 
On the Shaggy Show, shit we ain't playin'

It's been six months and my dick ain't havin' it

Anyway, been workin on my brand new shit 
A brand new group with my homies Twisted

About you havin' some kind of a panic attack

And when you have one, what the fuck do you do? 

Well, I'll be sittin' there enjoyin' a coffee 
And then all of a sudden, I'm like get off me! 
Then I start chokin off pedestrians 
Until they give me my shot of calliphilestrian

I like my chili hot. As a matter of fact I like my chili so God damn hot 
That you can cook a hog's ass in a spoonful. 
When a workin' man such as myself wants a little hot fixin, I reach for 
That bottle of momma's God Damn Hot Chili. 
Smooth tender chunks with chili beans filled with momma's hot bastard 
Bacon bits, and drizzled with just the right amount of thick savory sauce, 
Drippin' with noodle nuggets and Texas tough onions. 
Mm mm that's hot, God Damn Hot.

Bouncin', bankin' up corners smokin' dough 
Smokin' that weed, hangin' out with my locs and folks

Somebody took a black thing and went thump
That's TEEERRRIBlE!  We heard about it for months
What about that one nobody guy that they found?
Dead in the grass with his, dick in his ass
Plus there was more but you won't recall
Because Micheal Jackson squeezed up on some little kids balls
What you consider...DRAMA
Ain't all that, it's just that you're wack
with your intergalatic satellite data compress
But we can't feed the homeless
Then OJ's wack story unfolded
And everybody watched that while Oklahoma exploded
900 good reasons why this world really don't care
THAT'S WHEN IT CALLS FOR A WHEELCHAIR!

(2nd Verse- Shaggy2Dope)
LOOOORRDY-lord have we got a protest, man
Some rock-and-roll ninja bit the head off a bat
Was watching his concert, and channeled to hell
'cause he's so fucking TEERRRIBLE
Meanwhile his records sell double and triple
'cause of you crying about him rubbing his nipple
Religious? Shit, you helped them bang
Instead of helping them poor people eating out of them garbage cans
When you're done with them bitch, come protest me
Shit, motherfucker I could use some money
The whole world was crying when Kurt's gun went BANG!
When Eazy-E died though, it wasn't no thang
Rapper dies of A.I.D.S. but you hardly mention
Rocker blows his face off and becomes a legend
Everyone grab a shotgun, a hero is made
Maybe I should do that shit so J can get paid

I didn't mean nothing by it, I'ma make this quick
I gave your mama this dick

I don't know how it happened
I just know my nuts and her itch were slapping
I was over there mowing the grass
And I could feel her eyes all up on my ass
And then, I went inside to make a phone call
And there she was with her titty hanging out her bra
One thing just led to another

to the tip of my dick with one big lick
She calls me her big teddy bear

I used your sock though to catch my nut

I put it back, I knew you better

Your mom's ass look like oat meal yo
It's bumpy and grainy, I like to feel though
And I ain't trying to diss her either
I'm only saying that I'd wish she'd trim her beaver some
Every hair is like a foot long
Bitch looks like a werewolf wearing a thong sometimes
It's all right with me though
I don't mind as long as I can locate the V-Hole
And your dad's so dumb he's knowing nothing
Here I'm stuffing her muffin not to mention the pickle puffing
And I'm hoping you and me are still cool
I'm spending the night so she can drive me to school tomorrow
And we plan on fucking again
All right I'll talk to you later

I do a show and stab people at the same time, what of that
I stab bear cages security guards in the back of the neck
I love waffle house, I stab people there

I stabbed Tony Schiavone the commentator guy
before the match I went to shake his hand but I stabbed him in the eye
I stabbed Norman Smiley in the middle of a match
he was like ""What are you doing?"" I said fuckin relax
I stabbed him again and again, I jumped out and ran

I tried to stab my own brother, bad news for my health
he twisted my arm back, I ended up stabbing myself
I stab cabby drivers right through the thick glass

I saved up my money and went and saw the Lilith Fair

but there wasn't any pit, it was only me and that was it
but so what, I was throwin myself all over the floor
Sarah McLachlan was on stage, I said you fuckin whore
One time I met Slipknot, I stabbed their ass
stabbed them all in the face, that's why they wear masks
my little newspaper truck runs on a tank of blood
I drive with my lights off all through the neighborhood
but its so hard to sneak because of the muffler
I hate that fucker
I did a song with 3-6 mafia, them guys are the shit
we went to the studio and I started rockin it
After the session they all left up out of there
but I stayed behind and stabbed the engineer

I should probably take another pill or two
In the mirror, I see the face of Frankenstein,
And that face is mine
I go to work at subway, slicing ham (chop chop)
Cut my finger off again (ah damn!)
I walk home, tryin' to dodge and hide from thugs,
They like to beat on scrubs
I go through this all the time though, I call,
J, where the fuck you at? 
The mall,
Did you get your ass stomped again? 
No, yes, ha ha, so? 
Nobody sees what I see, do they? 
They just cast me aside, put me away
No friends, no style, no place to go,

Look at me now man, brain dead,
I could de-rail a fucking train with my forehead
I now live by the carnival dominion,
So mother fuck your opinion
I'm a looney path,
I kill pedestrians, families, neighbors, best of friends, anybody
And if I don't kill them, I keep them in my basement and drill 'em dead
Just kiddin', all I really did is unlock the forbidden
I just let my fucking mind unwind,
I don't care what you think, you don't inner-twine
Fuck the world, fuck everybody in it,
Even the sneaker pimps girl, I'd fuck her in a minute
You can live to impress and dress fresh bitch,
I don't care, fuck everybody out there!

Riders, loonies, stalkers, fat mans, gangstas, nymphos, assholes,
Crackheads

I smoke peace pipes with Indian war chiefs
I steal jewels with Chinese ninja thieves
I dress whales like guppies and crush walls
I throw giant ice bergs like snowballs
I surf tidal wave, drink molten rock
I'll put a fucking tornado in a headlock
I'll go to Italy and straighten that tower

Yes Captain
Status?
Completed
Your mission was to land on the Dirtball and explore it thoroughly.
You were to monitor the activities of a common life on the Dirtball,
And study peoples life styles,
Their general habits of living in their strange society.
Yes
Have you done that Galacto Inspector?
Yes I have Captain
Very well, may we have your report?
A strange place this Dirtball is
A lot of guns a lot of rich folks spitting on bums
A lot of hoodlums
These are just the bums that are really pissed off
Why? Probably 'cause they been ripped off by the system
Cops, they ride around in little cars
And throw folks behind bars, like little jars.
They supposed be there just to serve and protect,
But they just punch faces a lot, and choke necks.
Then they got the higher ups they call judges, and they rule the land.
This I don't understand.
First of all they like to dress this bitch up in a robe.
On top of all that, ""What?"" he's mad old.
And he hates anybody that looks different then he did back when he was a kid,
But that shit was like 400 years ago.
Captain ""Yes Galacto"" I just don't know.
Any kid that was going to jail. Yeah?
He looked me dead in the face and said 'Stale'
Then my cloaking device must of went dead. Why?

Now probes Data and Data, do your read me?
Yes, here sir
What information were you able to gather for us on your recent voyage to the 
Dirtball?
This is professor Data
My transmission signal is weak and my communication is shattered.
We came in contact with several different specimens of life.
Everything has got a price even if it's wrong or right.
Upon sight people judge and stereo type.
Their forms of government and religion are glorified.
Purified as the waters that are now polluted.
Members of the flock recruited for duty, locked up, or instituted.
This is doctor Data I phase with the planet to see how they medicate her.
She's high off that cane.
Depending how you slang you can get most anything.
From a nickel bag of grain to a lucy worth of cane.
Maintain communication Data here again
Their leader is determined by the vote of many men
Although he's only human and slightly over weight.
He control's and manipulates their whole United States.
I call to the white castle.
Secret service on the phone giving me a hassle.
He said the information I requested was denied.
Before he hung up the phone he took a deep breath, stopped, and replied:
This is our world
This is our world
This is our world
This is our world

The Dirtball may not be the ideal place to land our craft
After receiving this information we'll make our final judgment.
Fleek are you there?
I'm here, but hold up captain cause this ain't good.
I'm getting chased by some fat rednecks in white hoods.
I think there trying to kill me 'Well what do you mean?'
It seems they got a problem with the fact that I'm green
I guess on the Dirtball they all hate each other
If it ain't were your from, it's your skin color
Let me get my phaser tron out, hold up *buzz*
'What was that?'
I smoked 'em
But what really fuckin turns my tentacles is their relationships.
They swell each other's lips.
I see men that ain't shit in their daily life.
So they come home drunk and beat they wife.
She forgives him when he say's he didn't mean it.
You ask me they can both suck my petty lip.
I give up captain beam me back to Zelaloovy.
Another thing they love to watch horror movies.
But your not allowed to be scary on a CD.
They tried to ban this one group ICP.
I went to see 'em in concert J grabbed me by the head,

Insane Clown Posse,"The underworld watches in horror
As this marks the day that
3 of America's most notorious outlaws
Will be executed for their crimes
Together the states of Michigan and California
Will conduct the executions behind prison walls
The 3 prisoners are set to be executed by 3 separate methods
Electric chair, hanging, and firing squad
Midnight tonight will mark the first execution
Death waits in my cell I can smell him
Somebody tell him that I still breathe, leave
I'm alive I'll never see 25 
Yet still I can feel, I'm real
When it all happened I was in the lime light
News, camera, gaven killer stamina
Another year I'm here but forgotten
Skin is rotting feeling old, cold
Motherfucker in a robe gonna sentence me to die in a metal chair
Fizzle my nut hair
Bad enough I'll be dead
Yet I'm tryin to figure out a way
To keep my eyes from poppin out my head
Oh they'll remember my ass
Twitchin, with my eyes drippin down the glass
Shaggy I think they're tryin to start a riot
And then it's Ice T but he don't seem fazed by it
I know the devil's waitin on me
But does God like him playin his role in killin me though
Lock me up until I die maybe
But you can never tell 
We might sharing a cell in hell
Cause, my last request was
Let my homies smoke my ashes and catch a Violent J buzz
One more thing before you hit that switch
Please tell my momma that I'm sorry, I never

(Chorus x2)
Dead end no escape from it
Should've thought about that shit before you done it
Why? I, never want to die
Don't nobody cry for me, it's only murder

The lights dimmed in my cell block
Cause all the power they got surged into one spot
J's chair hear him screamin, fully loaded
It was funny at first till his head exploded
It's something else for me 
Another kill just as wicked 
But cheaper on the light bill
It all starts with a thick rope
Make a noose and I'm gone
Stretch out my neck bone
Minutes left I think about my brother
When we was young...
Wait I don't have a brother
What the fuck?
My minds in a tangle
I wish somebody was here that I could strangle
I keep waking up on the floor
Cause I strangle myself but what the fuck for?
Haha starin at the cracks on the walls
Whistlin necks, fidgetin my balls
Kill me it'll still all be the same
Wicked clown juggalo phantom of the night train
What if I drop, but don't die
Tie weights to my legs 
And give it another try
Still coming think of something, I speak
I'm not feelin so hot let's go for it next week
Didn't work, I pulled down my collar
At least they won't be hearin me holla
My neck shut

(Chorus x2)
Dead end no escape from it
Should've thought about that shit before you done it
Why? I, never want to die
Don't nobody cry for me, it's only murder

A bit past 1:30 a.m. now 
And the 3rd prisoner slowly makes his way
To the designated spot on prison grounds
Where he will be executed by way of firing squad
I got seven bitches aiming at me
My backs against the wall
If I only had my strap then I could plug 'em all
Watch 'em fall
But they got my ass tied up behind this wall
So the homies can't ride up
Known killer in fact I killed the most
At random though some of them I planned 'em
Fuck it, I kicked your bucket for you, floor you
Got more guns if there's more of ya
War with the cops no prob 
They shouldn't took the job
Blow holes throught they heads like donuts
Grown-ups, kids and girls
Gather round and get gunned down
I do it for the fun of it, adrenaline rush
Coked up quick to bust 
Plus I love my dust
Gun son, watch the blood run son
I'm on one, muthafuckas
But check it this time I'll be the one dissected
I can't wait to feel the heat when lead and flesh meets
Bitter sweet baby, I been waiting for this
Go straight to hell kick it with the rest of my clique
Fuck a blindfold I want to look 'em deep in they eyes
So they can see the fool's face of a dog as he dies
Plus I want to see the muthafuckas squeeze
I got a hot date with my soul mate
Bust I can't wait

If I could change anything, it would be the mirror
When I look into a mirror

I can't fix my hair or check my clothes
I can't even see it if there's a booger hangin' out my nose

Don't nobody care that I'm trapped in a pine box
Smooth with the buttoned up shirt and the dress socks

Insane Clown Posse," 

Father, I confess for doing
I had a brain, but life had to ruin it
Dissinfected, Disected, Don't Respect It
When you put me in a cage full of animals
Savages and cold blooded canibals
I can't help but come but abouts me
try to run but they found me, surround me
Then they choke ya, and provoke ya
try to smoke ya, turn you into a joka
I tried to rub it off, but its all I know
the only thing I ever knew, so what to do
look at you, a bigot till your growin old
your growin mold, with a soul that's freezin cold
so I confess, but even if I'm all wrong
I'll be down with the clown till I'm dead and gone

Chorus

I confess, this lady had a purse, so I took it
I took it home, opened it, I shook it
she had papers, lipstick and nail polish
credit cards and about 27 dollars
I bought a 5th, drank it and laid there
it seemed like, I could see the purse everywhere
on the light post, by this mail box
I tried to run from it, I ran a couple blocks
but there it was, on the side walk, waitin for me
it tried to lure me to it, I had to fuckin' do it
I picked it up, and stuck my fuckin' hand in it
it was full of rats, and they fuckin' bit it off
father I confess, I'm a criminal
but my worlds too subliminal around me
look at them, all the wicked masses
that's why I'm down with the clown till I'm ashes

Chorus

Its like a circus, a wicked carnival
Everybodys got a tickit, they're lookin
For the freaks, to point and gawk at
Look at yourself, the jokes on you jack

Flying over frozen mountains
Crystal rivers and geizer fountains

Glide through cities of brick and stone
Broken arrows of ancient roan

Pyramids crumble when nature calls
Skies of blue become black with stars
Lightning bugs kept within jars
Sand moves slowly through the hour glass
Wings spread, we can all fly last

Everybody come and fly away
You must believe that you can fly away
Spread your wings and come and fly away
Just believe that you will fly away

Rock will melt, coal crystalize
The clouds and skylines materialize
Wings spread take flights over northern lights
Wolves howl over blood-red moonlit nights
We're Kings and Queens within our dreams
The sky rains down into ruby rings
Oceans river lakes and ponds
Lions unicorns birds and ???

Insane Clown Posse," 

you know the irony of life is that you have like
this big dream to get where you want to be
but once you get there you start to dream about where you came from.
I guess that's the part of the circle of our lives
like the hands of a clock going round.
if only we could wind them back and return to a time where the dream began.
its all too soon that's all will be is a dream in someones mind.

Look at me I'm famous on top of the world,
I finally reached up in time (im a superstar)
stand up, step back and take a look
is this really whut I had in mind? (i don't really think so)
I guessed them goals that we set in the day,
they actually came to be. (yup yup)
but now I'm lookin at a black white paper,
and with a whole book of memories (but we never read)

seven deep in the jeep with the camel top,
everybody and they drunk as hell,
?? and awesome dre and anybody by the right would see us
(cause we always went there)
songs were long and pollution strong, and the faygo always warm and flat
(thats nasty)
but if now if this supposed to be heaven for me, then just give me my own
hell back

so take me home
(to my empty refridgerator)
c'mon and take me home
(to a life in which I understand)
so take me home
(to my old school down in delray)
c'mon and take me home
??

(cmon cmon) lets go y'all

there's another festival down town,
take some bottles back up to the store
(i found two of em)
that would get us bus money down there
to get back we have to find some more
(might as well get drunk)
hangin our flyers up everywhere,
we coulda sworn we was makin noise,
(everybody knew us)
finally we had everyone in southwest
representin with the jj boys (everybody)

I stole to eat (i stole)
I stole to live (i stole)
I stole only to survive (if yous a hoodlum)
just like j said in 'ghetto zone' I stole a car with my tape inside
all we did was try to talk to hoes,
and none of them was tryin to hear (not 1 hoe)
it woulda meant so much more back then
cause now its fake hoes everywhere

so take me home
(to my empty refridgerator)
c'mon and take me home
(to a life in which I understand) (where you at y'all?)
so take me home
(to my old school down in delray) (summer time)
c'mon and take me home (delray)

mike p y'all

southern rock for ya

rudeboy

oh lord don't let me get my girlfriends call
if she don't get off until two (we got all night long)
I finally show up at 4:30 am
and I still have to drop my crew off (but i'll be back)
now I'm alone and ontop of it all,
looking deep in the back of my mind (looking deep in the back of my mind)
I realised the key to a happy life
was right here wit me the whole time

Chorus x2
so take me home

Never once been seen alone
Ever since you can remember you was fully grown
Slangin' rocks on tha block with a knot in ya sock
Then you might be..

Gang related! murder rap
Notches all in your belt
Robbery and sellin'
Trees the only jobs that you held

Been to more damn funerals than the reverend himself
Then you might be..

Did your crew's name originate in illinois?

I'm always asked if I'm gang related
By police and the public and I'm startin' to hate it
If I wasn't already that would sure make me think
About the problems that I have and what I'd do to be free

Besides gang related's such a harsh word
For them to call a bunch of homies takin' over tha world
Willin' to die for everything that we built
The battleground we call turf where haters come to be killed

He's fuckin' crazy as hell
You wouldn't know
Right now he's chewin' holes in the floor here at the studio

I don't even want to do this
But he asked me to and I'm scared of his pistol-whips
We're all sick in the hatchet's hatchery
But I just happen to be the master bitch-slappery

The bottom line, I won't say it again until you play it again

I ran into thy main room and Shaggy was dead, so was Nate the Mac, Jumpsteady and ABK 
Bolted out of thy house to see if it's a joke, I heard hundreds of car alarms, saw flames and smoke 
And thy sky above red, I see dead bodies fallin' it's raining with corpses thy blood is appalling

I hope I never see what all them people saw
And put them in there places
(Thy blood is appalling), 
The sun was so hot, 
So hot
I was burning,
Yeah 

Dead bodies lay randomly some stack in piles, on all of there faces pour horror, no smiles 
I see children, and ciders, and ninjas my age, all lay naked and mangled, most withered for days, 
I found safety a shelter I'm under a tree; only fingers and organs come falling on me, 
I lay sleepless for days as thy raining continued, thy heat of thy sun baking corpses like food 
Then it finally stopped I walk knee deep in blood, over piles of bodies threw what was my hood

See the idea is to make you die (Stop it)
I don't know why but your heart beat offends me
I need to cut you off at the windpipe desperately
(Like, how but cuttin your own neck) I did
17 times why you think I talk like this?
Before I cut myself THIS WAS MY VOICE
Now gimme your neck pipe, you don't have no fuckin choice
(I'm not ready to die) Neither was Eazy-E
What makes you so fuckin special you can escape the Wreath
(You mean Wraith) I said Wraith, now shut the fuck up
And give me you windpipe so I can cut the motherfucker
(Pick somebody else) I'm pickin anybody I can find
And you happen to be the next motherfucker in like

And about 1, 2, 3 of those motherfuckers, I'm outta here

How you gonna give me a straight jacket when I'm crooked
Took it and shook it, ripped it and unzipped it
And waited for the nurse guy to bring me my tray
Jumped him from behind and turned his head backwards my way
Took all his keys and a crate of Methadone
Masturbated on myself and leaped out the window
Then I turned around and went right back inside
Once I realized I could've grabbed a gang of Formeldahyde
Suddenly another fuckin guard shot me
I played the whole movie shits off like ""You got me""
Laid there playin dead and when he checked my pockets
I jabbed my fuckin thumb knuckle deep in his eye socket
By now there was guards everywhere
I'm steady cuttin heads off, surfin on a wheelchair
And too many bullets finally put me away
But was it the real Violent J?

Always Uninvited, (fuck off) unrespected
Sometimes he creeps, other times he expected
He hangs out in bad neighborhoods up at the park
He will strike in broad daylight but prefers the dark
3 little kids caught inside a broken home
He'll just sit there and wait for 'em (Leave 'Em Alone!)
As sure as we're today and death is inevitable
He's waitin there watchin through the eyes of a crow

Death is always at a shitty time
Don't bother trying to run and hide
Take his hand cross to the other side (Step to the other side)

Freeway intersections when the bars close, he loves 'em
Blew out traffic lights, he hovers above 'em
And he loves the motherfuck outta crackheads and heroin
Rehab centers and caring mothers always scaring him
Sharing them needles? He encourages and raw sex?
They got him workin and steady collectin soul checks
Then again, 9 times outta 10
I wish he take me instead of some of these poor children we see

(Chorus) 2x

(J & Shaggy)
He remains nameless but we call him the Wraith
He is the 6th Jokers Card of the Dark Carnival faith
That's it, now your clock is tickin, every second counts
And everything you do that righteous or wrong, it all amounts
And whether you going to heaven or hell, he doesn't care
He's only here to give you the death touch, and send you there
Most people fear him because they don't understand
That once he finally touches you with death eternity can begin

He hangs out in bad neighborhoods up at the park he will strike in broad day light but prefers the dark

I got your fuckin present hangin next to my nuts
Now when i'm swingin on my hatchet if it hits you it cuts
Don't make me chop your head in half and smack the side with the cheek
Because I haven't had my melorol in almost a week
Your fuckin mama brought me here to entertain ya ass
So no matter what I do I expect you to laugh
Now when I do a trick and even if it isn't funny
Give me props unless you want your little necks bloody
I could probably do a cartwheel or something if you move the couch
But that ain't what i'm fuckin about
I could sew your mouth shut and pump air in through ya nose
And fuckin pop ya head but we'd get blood on our clothes
Look i'm a wicked clown I ain't no fuckin superhero
Ain't that big and scary though I fly like little Rey Mysterio
I'm quick to beat down all you little bitches right in front of you mom
And if the bitch gets heated tell her bring it on

I've lived the life of a king.

I'm just some typical guy
I ain't no fuckin' hero

I've seen some children crossing the bridge
What kind of life did they get to live
What kind of choice do they get to make
What if it was a child's mistake

I never question the book
But lets say I live by the book
I'd never eat meat on Tuesdays
How much bigger would my wings look

I try to pray everyday
But sometimes get lost on the way
I've seen the holiest spirit
So much to mislead the way

I've gave the visions I got
I've been told I'm gonna rot
Inside the devils intestines
I'm still here holding my spot

People drawn together by rare and scubby music
And we even gather once a year to put it down

We speak in languages people don't understand

Then I see the platinum on the wall, and I realize
The carnivals been right here all along, so lets bring it on

Time itself. Thus emerges a being so powerful that he can exist between both
The land of the living, and that of the dead. He goes by many names but is
Known to thy living only as thy Wraith. He walks upon worlds forgotten, and
Descends from Heavens; fade into gray to witness thy death of all mortal
Things, so that he may guide thy departed upon thy path that they have chosen

",Thy Intro,2002
Insane Clown Posse,"The car broke down and she was like ""Honey, get the flash light""
Still one in the dash right?
Only cause it's late at night
And who knows
What's out there
She was right tho
Ain't gonna help with a light tho
People dying tonight
Cause yo this maniac is, out there
I'm hanging like a possum
Murder tricks, I got some
Spot them
Look come around to the bottom
And slaughter them, out there
His boo was locked up in the car
On the phone and tripping hard
Screaming
Fuck that bitch was scurred
There's a killer out there
Cut that crying shit off
I cut
You die
I get off
I'm crawling up on the car
Trying to rip the moon roof lid off, out there
Bitch turned the wipers on
Hazard lights and blew the horn
I smashed with my axe, and pulled her to the lawn, out there
She kicked me hard, to the grill
With one of them, Doc Martin heels
Murderas, you know how that feels
Your lip be out there
Time to die
Close my eyes
Swung and felt a thump
I done spilt her head in half like a tree stump, out there

[Chorus]
Don't you dare go out there, ain't no telling what lies out there
Don't you dare go out there, ain't no telling what can happen
Don't you dare go out there, ain't no telling what lies out there
Don't you dare go out there, late night killas might be stabbing

Lights on in the house
But it's dark outside
You can even close one eye
Look bitch, I'm out there
Camp fire lit
Boy Scout meeting's they talk of me
Even they leaders got memories of me, I'm out there
Forensic scientists try to finger me out
But I'm too quick for their Sheriff's stupid asses
I'm still out there
Pull up all your road blocks
I'm running them them's in my socks
Silently taken out all cops, one by one, I'm out there
Leave they bodies
In the street
Continue on my murder spree
They can believe all my heat
When I pull it out there
Break up into the Zoo
Dress up in a monkey suit
Sticking up families for they loot, my brain, is out there
Handy with an ice pick
Pull it out and use it good
In and out your temple
Blood is squirting all out there
I'm the urban legend you heard at your college dorm
Jump out and squeeze your vocal cords
When you out there

[Chorus]

Some where out there a remnance of Bushwick
My mind loads clips at your block
And leave you stuck bitch
A psychopath
With a clasp and a black ski mask
Leave you in body bags
For a news flash
I might be small
But I got big balls
Write my name on the wall
With bloodstains after the brawl
Evil thoughts run deep in my brain
I'm sick and deranged
So picture the pain
Flowing in my veins
Yeah I'm sick
I'm sicker then Hitler
My gat spit streak mothafucking forbidden scriptures
Niggas run from a gun, forgetting they can't
I drag a Mossberg, cause it won't fit in my pants
I run up in your ride, it's parked and
It's darken
Jump out your glove compartment, sparking
The shit that I do, make many faint
Dead saint
Turn your blood into candy paint

I killed hot bitches out there but I grow weed plants
So every time I hit the blunt 
It's like I'm hitting that ass

And I'm Shaggy, throwing heads in the air by the hair
I bounce them off my heals while people cough they meals
I kick heads like soccor balls and do tricks with them
I get hotter than a globetrotter, twirling and spinning

I sick with it with a sword, I can balance and stand on it
Killed many men, one swing in the end
I'm so quick you won't see shit but the guy's eyes wiggling
And me in the Bruce Lee stance giggling

I rob liquor stores at night when the workers are tired
I run up in that bitch swinging chainsaws on fire
And I can balance on a ball while juggling all your limbs

While rest of you is chained up in a chair watching him
Under the big top

So many tricks to show (Come down)
So many freak shows to go to (Come down)
So many eyeballs to throw

And then wear your slippers and fuck your wife
You get a pie in the face, a fucking pie in the face
Then you get cut up and sent to your momma in a suitcase

Bitch I'm Shaggy clear outta my squares
I ride a bike backwards in my underwears
I tell human stories to ghosts and I dead the awake
Plus I'm trapped in the other side of the mirror I think

Twenty five chairs stacked up, I'm on the top
Fucking balancing on my head, I'm about to drop
And I'm holding up a bear on my foot that juggaling
All six in the mix, will this be the end?

This will the end of my dick all up in another bitches ass
Wicked clowns will make the wicked shit last
And I kick a dick's ass trying to stop the shit
Icepick to your temple than pop your shit

You recognize my voice? I'm in a ski mask mugging ya
I can walk on stilts 900 feet high
And than drop a dart down straight into your eye

Well I'm Shaggy Shaggs, I went from rags to rags
And I've received many meals out your garbage bags
I can do backflips all the way up a wall
Swinging an axe, that was the last thing that you saw

I can slit your throat from across the room
Throwing a Joker's Card under the light of the moon
And then I hook my feet onto your swinging ceiling fan
With two swords and yell for everybody else to come in

You can split me in the middle or saw straight down
You have two one legged halves of me jumping around
You can cut them in half, you have four of us fuckers
My limbs all crawling and attacking like brothers
Under the big top

So many freak shows to go to (Come down)
So many eyeballs to throw

The struggle lives hard times, we do or die
My whole crews fly hands high to the sky
So maintain son elevate try to build
But now you're still 'cause incarceration is for real
Yeah son you know its on
Now who would be the clown in the nine-six to mess around and catch a
fist
I show no mercy if you irk me
I got physical that alert me when some herb tried to jerk me
Or put the squeeze on it, break down the cipher
But it won't work, were tight like the Q-Tip in the fight
Now is you insane is your brain intact
We be official when it comes to this no B.S. rap
Here comes the lyrical, aerial raid right where you rest at
Now test that
I snatch your heart right through your chest black
Gettin ill thoughts when I sleep at night
I gotta maintain, blot the blood stains on my brain
>From the clappin, we can make it happen
Remember you ain't a killer, you only rappin
I hate it, rappers over exaggeratin
And never shot a gun in they life, they only masterbatin
So come clean and keep it real if you like my sound
And wave your hands in the air and put the nines down
[Chorus: 2X]
Brothas fought daily in the streets, we reek havoc
On every block someones flippin like an acrobat
I'm kinda young but I still gotta hold my own
And Ima maintain what's mine till the day I'm grown
I keep my crew up, people say I got a gang
But I don't smoke I don't shoot and my crew don't slang
We just hang tryin to get up in this rap game
So I can gain so fame and build my crews name
Rollin with juvenile thugs wit bad grades and bad ways
Who woulda thought that I had some AIDS
Dream totes and aspirations
Brothas are tired of being broke so maybe that's why they free-basing
Wastin time doing nothing
Livin like an outcast gotta get up get out and get something
[Chorus: 2X]
Look into my eyes see if you can see what I can see
In my reality the whole world is after me
Schemin on the key but yo I got this locked down
Me and lost and found comin out the underground
Takin no prisoners my listeners we keep it real
My thoughts are militant, when I'm in the killin field
Click click, my minds automatic, so where's the static
I got some joints up in my attic if you want to grab it
I form a cipher where my peace brothers don't sleep
You try to creep I guarantee that's when you feel the heat
I come correct in this rap game
Rappers act insane
Meanwhile I'm blowin the mic an back in the frame
They can't see me, they can't feel the real G
I represent, commercial rap will never kill me

Settin' fires, damagin' and breakin' into schools
IN THE DARKNESS - it's much easier to be heartless
Break the window out the Lincoln, and screwdriver-start this
Muggin' people, droppin' on 'em from street lights
Stab 'em with garden tools or beat 'em with pipes
So don't come out, stay inside cozy and tucked
And if I'm breakin' in, your old lady's gettin..FUCKED!

ALL DAY - car jacks, get out the van
As soon as they step out I pop 'em anyway, BLAAM!

I know it's nothing but it's something when it's bustin' at your nose
SUNNY DAYS - I hit up the beach with cleats on
And stomp bitches in they ass tryin' to tan in they thongs
ALL DAY - see me fuckin' hookers at truck stops
And then I kill em, 'cause that's where my buck stops

ALL NIGHT - I'm wicked and I got the power
Blood sheds on the wall during the witching hour
IN THE DARKNESS - see me ride by in an Impala
Draggin' some fuck ass by the foot and hear him holla

I'll run through emergency rooms and sever life-lines
Fuck the limelight, I'm the one I need to impress
With a double dip swingin' ax chop to your chest!

And burned holes in his face with the magnifying glass

BLAME IT ON THE MOONLIGHT OR BLAME IT ON THE BOOGIE
I shot the motherfuckin' sheriff and his deputy rookie

And boogie the woogie and stab hoes
Don't even gimme a pound when you see this clown
You gettin' cut the FUCK up and chopped the FUCK down!

Thank God, many people think I'm odd
But I talk with no one and I walk alone
And I avoid sunlight with a chalky tone
I get home and don't say hi, it ain't no one there
I don't care I walk in and go right up the stairs
To my room, get in bed and just wait for dark
Because that's when the real show start (tap tap)
""Tap tap"" on the glass go the piece of ass
So young and pretty it's too bad she past
But she comes to my room and we talk at night
She's demonic and bloody, but she holds me tight
In my bedroom, with her I'm never alone
And I kiss her cold lips until the morning come
Then she gone, I can still hear her voice loom
But she only exist in the dark of my room

Usually we just lay there and we hold each other
We're lovers, we don't need others
One of my mother's cats jumped up on the covers
And it scared my baby, guess she don't like pets
So I twisted it's fuckin' head off at the neck
Look baby, it's bloody, it's gone, it's doomed
Please...come back to the room
I'll do anything for thy, don't ignore me
This is more than a sick love story
Without you I'd bring a shotgun to school
And I will if you want me to for any reason
I hate that you leave when the lights come on
And if I had it my way the fuckin' sun would be gone

Sometimes I kiss her, I start shakin'
She slips me the tongue and it tastes like bacon
Uh oh, something's wrong baby's upset
She told me she was spotted by the neighbor's kid
She can't come back now 'cause they know our secret
Unless I can make them keep it
If I do she may come to life
Now I'm in their yard with a shotgun and knife
Cut the screen, went in and found the kid
Blew a bowl of spaghetti in the side of his head
And the daddy was next runnin' down the hall
I shredded his throat and he was quick to fall
Tossed the Mossberg and gripped the knife
Started stabbin' the shit outta his wife
Went home a bloody mess with a job well done (tap tap)
Wash up and wait for my baby to come (tap tap)

Love..(I can't ignore you)
In my room..(do anything for you baby) {tap tap}
Love..(I do adore you)
In my room..you and I...{Tap tap go the piece of ass}

I waited 2 or 3 days, 4 days
Waitin' for the ""tap tap"" like always
I waited and hated this (tap tap)
I created a bloody mess (tap tap)

I waited 2 or 3 months, 4 months
Waitin' for the ""tap tap"" just for once
I waited and hated this (tap tap)
I created a bloody mess (tap tap)

Insane Clown Posse,"Fuck, Damnit Another Halloween
People on Military know what this means,
Houses on fire,They're blowin up cars,
Creatures on the street and razorblades in candybars.

I went to trick-or-treat the first house on my block
They spit in my face and gave me a rock
I tried to give it back and said I'll take nothing instead 
Turned around and walked away and felt the rock peg me in the head

Walked to the next house directly next door
And there I found an old lady dead on the floor
I said 'Excuse me miss but do you have a treat?'
She lifted her leg and scraped flakes off her dead feet

I ran to the next house happy and giddy
There I seen a fat woman holding up her titty
I said trick or treat she said treat or trick
And squeezed on her titty til .. fuck it its to sick 

The next house was set back in the woods
I was a little frightened but fuck I want the goods
I knocked on the door I heard a knock back
Then I heard 'come on in' and yo I'm like fuck that

This house belongs to miss Cherry Spoon
She said drop your drawers and your treat is comin soon
I quickly grew a stiffy but kept my eyes shut
A hand came out the mail chute and flicked me in the nuts

I wobbled to the next house ready for the worst
And chillin in the drive was a long black hurst
I rung the doorbell and said is anybody home
'Of course babyboy have a sugar coated kidney stone'

I walked through the feild into the next crib
Her friendliness could only be in her cooking bib 
I said how bout some candy
She said how bout in stead a nice hot fresh homemade loaf of yeast in infection bread

My bags gettin heavy so I rest on the curb 
And riding on his bike here comes little Larry Sherb
I snuck up behind him and kicked him off his seat
Punched him in the neck and powerbombed him in the street

Now my bag of candy has doubled in size
Up to the next house for my scary prize
I'm like trick or treat trick treat tricky dick
He opened up his door slapped my lips and didn't give me shit

Rock through his window and ran across the street
To the big mansion I'm in for a treat
I dinged on the dong
And here comes the butler 
A big gumpy tall ass Lurch lookin mother fucker
I said hello mister is there something for my sack 
He reached in his pocket but I think he hurt his back
Its taking him and hour my bag is open ready 
But then he finally dropped it in my sack a fuckin penny

The next house is abandoned so forget it
But wait a minute I think somebody's livin in it
I ran up to the door trick or treat you can't hide 
It was a crackhead he crawled in my bag and died

The next house was mine the last on the block
My mother's sitting on the porch shining up her clock
I climbed on the roof with my brother jump steady
And we yelled HAPPY HALLOWEEN AND CLOWN LOVE TO THE CITY!

Fuck Damnit another Halloween
