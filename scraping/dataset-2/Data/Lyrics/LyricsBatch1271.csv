Will Heard,"I will for love

Even if our world is done

Will Heard,"It's on a rumour mill, the word is on the street, I
I don't know how to feel about what you say to me, I

Will Heard,"There's a new day

There's a new day coming
There's a new day coming
There's a new day coming (There's a new day)
There's a new day coming

Well I hear it in the distance
Like an angel calling me
I must be getting closer to finding my destiny
There's a road we must travel, oh the road wraps around
And every twist and turn, there's a new lesson to be found
There's a moment in your life
Point of no return
Where you hold onto your dreams
And let your, let your bridges burn

There's a new day coming (There's a new day)
There's a new day coming
There's a new day coming (There's a new day, there's a new day coming)

Will Heard,"[Verse 1: Sinead Harnett]
I'm treading over water just for you
Don't care how deep it gets if you're true
Just tell me something, show me a sign
Cause you got me believing in things that I can't see

[Pre-Chorus: Sinead Harnett]
I don't really wanna wait forever darling, darling
You take me to a place I've never been before, yeah
Through every single step I'll follow you darling, darling
As long as you give me what I'm looking for

[Chorus: Sinead Harnett]
I don't believe in magic but I know that you're real
It's not something I can see but something I feel
I don't believe in magic but I know that you're real
It's not something I can see but something I feel, feel

[Verse 2: Will Heard]
I've been watching the way that you move
Makes me feels like I need to prove
Myself to you, this is a sign
For my heart it's pouring out feelings that's hard to conceal

[Pre-Chorus: Will Heard]
I don't really wanna wait forever darling, darling
You take me to a place I've never been before, no
Through every single step I'll follow you darling, darling
As long as you give me what I'm looking for

Will Heard,"Tell me that you need me
To help you find a way
Through all of this madness
Can I be your light of day?
Please, won't you believe me?
Even if you don't agree
Know that I am trying
To help us all break free

Oh, there'll be nothing left for no one, no
There'll be nothing left for no one

I'm saying that I'm sorry
For things I've said and done
But I don't want to be here
If I'm, I'm looking down a gun

Will Hedgecock,"Her name was Lola, she was a showgirl 
With yellow feathers in her hair and a dress cut down to there 
She would merengue and do the cha-cha 
And while she tried to be a star 
Tony always tended bar 
Across the crowded floor, they worked from 8 til 4 
They were young and they had each other 
Who could ask for more? 

At the copa (CO!) Copacabana (Copacabana) 
The hottest spot north of Havana (here) 
At the copa (CO!) Copacabana 
Music and passion were always in fashion 
At the copa they fell in love 

His name was Rico 
He wore a diamond 
He was escorted to his chair, he saw Lola dancing there 
And when she finished,he called her over 
But Rico went a bit to far 
Tony sailed across the bar 
And then the punches flew and chairs were smashed in two 
There was blood and a single gun shot 
But just who shot who? 

At the copa she lost her love 

Her name is Lola, she was a showgirl, 
But that was 30 years ago, when they used to have a show 
Now it's a disco, but not for Lola, 
Still in dress she used to wear, 
Faded feathers in her hair 
She sits there so refined,and drinks herself half-blind 
She lost her youth and she lost her Tony 
Now she's lost her mind 

At the copa don't fall in love 
Don't fall in love",Capacabana,2008
Will Hedgecock,"Every night I hope and pray

Will Hedgecock,"Look at me
I'm as helpless as a kitten up a tree
And I feel like I'm clinging to a cloud
I can't understand
I get misty, holding your hand

Walk my way
And a thousand violins begin to play
Or it might be the sound of your hello
That music I hear
I get misty the moment you're near

You can say that you're leading me on
But it's just what I want you to do
Don't you realize how hopelessly I'm lost
That's why I'm following you

On my own
Would I wander through this wonderland alone
Never knowing my right foot from my left
My hat from my glove
I get misty, and too much in love

I'm too misty, and too much in love",Misty,2008

Will Hoge,"I don't feel the same as I did when you walked out my door 
And I don't see things the same as I did from down there on your floor 
So you can take back all of those things that you told me were true because 
I'm pretty sure that I'm over you 

Take back that photograph with your pretty little red dress on 
I don't need the memories that keep me walking the floor until dawn 
But don't you worry because my lonely night will soon be through 
Because I'm pretty sure that I'm over you 
Oh yes I'm pretty sure that I'm over you 
 
And I just don't feel the same as I did before 
This time around I won't let you back in my door 
So you can take back all of those things that you told me were true 
Because I'm pretty sure I'm over 

Oh yes I'm pretty sure I'm over 
I'm pretty sure that I'm over you 
I'm over you",(Pretty Sure) I'm Over You,2001
Will Hoge,"See her walking alone in this city of heartache and stone 
She finds her way down to where she once found all her dreams she doesn't understand 
Why something she'd given her heart to could die 
But that's just the way it works out they say it's alright 

[Chorus] 
She's coming back down 
This carousel ride has stopped spinning round 
She wants to say she's sorry and stay but it's too late 
Now this carousel ride has shut down 

Fingertips trace the lines pens and papers recall the good times 
But clocks they do run and change what's been done say goodbye 

[Chorus]

[Bridge]

And I want you to come with me tonight 
I don't know if it's real but it surely feels right 

[Chorus]",Carousel,2001
Will Hoge,"She was just 16 with a pack of cigarettes and a pawn shop ring
She wanted things to turn out like she'd seen on that silver screen
So she hit the road with her thumb in the air and a ring in her nose
She had a tattoo of a butterfly because that's the way it goes 
When you don't know just which way the wind will blow

[Chorus] 
Hey girl where are you going to
Say that you'll be the queen of heartbreak avenue

She met a boy out there with a silver el dorado and jet black hair
He had a tattoo of Elvis so they took their clothes off to compare 
And well you know just how far these things can go

Then the sun came shining bright and true love in the morning 
Never feels like it did last night
He left a letter that said goodbye hold on tight
Now he's gone so she'll just move along

[Chorus]

[Bridge]

So you say you don't know how your broken
Dreams just drag you down

[Chorus]",Heartbreak Avenue,2001
Will Hoge,"It's four in the morning the phone on the wall is ringing so loudly 
I'm sick of it all but what can I do 
I told you again that we're through 
The neighbors upstairs yes they know these paper thin walls let everything show 
They say keep it down but I can't with you hanging around 

[Chorus] 
Well you tell me you don't want to fight 
You're just here to see if I'm doing alright 
Well darling let me be lonely tonight 

The sound of hearts shattering down on the floor is just the same as it was once before 
My wisdom in years just won't be washed away by your tears 
Now I can see your disguise is nothing more than red lipstick 
And lies painted for me to see that you won't let me be 

[Chorus]",Let Me Be Lonely,2001
Will Hoge,"Ms. Williams where did you stay last night 
Say you wasn't home till the sun was shining far too bright 
The way you wear your hair I know it surely was not right 
Ms. Williams could you tell me where you stayed last night 

Sun goes down and it's the same old thing 
Float the whiskey river to the mountains of cocaine 
Looking for that one true love to tell her she's a star 
Instead she's drinking with a long haired boy that plays a rock and roll guitar

[Chorus:] 
she just wants to shine 
Her heart gets broken every time but she knows some day soon she'll find 
Ms. Williams where did you stay last night

In a wedding dress that no one wore 
The whole world's on fire so she slams the door 
With a bible on the front seat and a shotgun in the floor she 
Points her headlights into hollywood because she wants so much more 

[Chorus]

[Repeat first verse]",Ms. Williams,2001
Will Hoge,"Hail hail rock and roll 
Come here son and let me help you sell your soul 
Sit right down and everything will be just fine 
Sign right here and it will all work out in time 

Sit right down and I will tell you about the plan 
See I'm gonna make you 50 thousand dollars and I'll only take 10 million 
But did I mention I got a new mercedes benz 
Smile pretty be witty come meet your brand new friends 

[Chorus] 
Everybody thinks that you'll go far 
You're gonna be a rock and roll star 

Now you got a banker and a lawyer on 16th avenue 
That's the funny things they call you when you spend a couple extra years in school 
They got big black cars and dollar signs in their eyes too 
What is a boy like me to do 

I got this guitar I play a little out of tune 
But it makes no difference if I get all the right tattoos 
And hey get a look at these cheekbones 
Who cares if mick taylor was ever even in the rolling stones 

[Chorus]

Besides he didn't even get that far 
But me I'm gonna be a rock and roll star 
Yes I am so now we're living happy underneath the sony tree 
I got my big top 10 record on wkd? 

Something or other bartender could I have another and another and another 
You're lucky we're even drinking in this bar 

[Chorus]",Rock and Roll Star,2001
Will Hoge,"I see her every morning as the sun drips slowly down 
Walking up on my street to her swanky little job uptown 
She's got an office with a window I'm looking out my window too 
I wish the four winds would blow and change my point of view 

Doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo 
She wears them high steppin shoes and her dress seems to fit so right 
I got two pair of corduroy pants everybody says they fit too tight 
I got a 3 dollar shirts on she got 55 dollar hair 
I want to pick her up and take her down but she's already been there probably two times 

[Chorus:] 
And every time I see her I just cry 
Ain't no sense in even wondering why 
She don't care about me 

I know she lives on 4th street or somewhere round about all 
I want to do is hold her hand or hang her dirty laundry out 
She's got a sister names Alice her older brother's name is bill 
She ain't got no dentist but her teeth are shiny still 

[Chorus]
 
She probably likes those older men with those big long cars and don't care much for fools like me That spend time in all these smoke filled bars 
She likes shirts and ties and cigarettes that smell like fallen leaves I just want to be the monkey That she lets climb her big tall tree 

[Chorus]",She Don't Care,2001
Will Hoge,"Here we sit again and tales begin to spin
About the things that we've done and seen
Stories of wine glutton and glory
And the occasional altered dreams

Appetites for memories grow
As the sunshine begins to fade
Across the hill it's the same old chill
Lurking right there in the shade

Just a child with bright eyes and a smile
Laughter was all she knew
Her mama was away and all papa did was pray
So the wanderlust slowly grew

She spread her wings and a couple other things
For the medicine man downtown
With his bottle of elixir he said that he would fix her
And soon she was going down

And everyone begins to look the same
Feel the burn from the same old evil flame
We watched her fall from sweet and kind
And I wish she could come back sweet Magdeline

She was gone on a bad trip
Followed by a needle and a silver spoon
Mama sat and cried and papa told us lies
Said she'd be back real soon

Suddenly the seasons changed
From the fall back to the spring
Answers live like peasants here
When the questions reign as king

And everyone begins to look the same
Feel the burn from the same old evil flame
We watched her fall from sweet and kind
And I wish she could come back sweet Magdeline

Just a child with bright eyes and a smile
Laughter was all she knew
Mama was away and papa sat and prayed
While the wanderlust that slowly grew

She spread her wings and wanted to do things
For the medicine man downtown
And with his bottle of elixir he said that he would fix her
And soon she was, soon she was going down, yeah

And everyone begins to look the same
Feel the burn from the same old evil flame
We watched her fall from sweet and kind
And I wish she could come back
And I will really do is, wish she come back
I wish she could come back sweet Magdeline
",Sweet Magdeline,2001
Will Hoge,"I remember as the seasons turned to fall 
Wind was sitting and the leaves fell a hinting a sign of the near winter's ball 
Chill in the air as I strolled down the front steps looking for a tale to tell 
Then she slipped me a stare as I slid into my chair she already knew me too well 

She said hello in that beautiful voice my reply was nowhere as sweet 
She seemed impressed by the state of my mess laughed at the wings on my feet 
Offered me a cigarette and before I could even refuse 
We were standing alone she was chilled to the bone she told me to sing the blues 

[Chorus:] 
Hey hey now I feel alright and I just wanted to see 
If I may if I might be the king of your world tonight 
So I told her of the books I'd read and details about the time I stole 6 dollars from a man named Jed just to turn around and pay him back 

I quoted my favorite poem but I ended it terribly wrong 
She said I understand then she clapped both her hands and said that's my favorite song 

[Chorus]

Just then a man walked in and took her away she said her sweet goodbye 
I'll see you again some day so it was over and I was standing there all alone 
And I said to myself as I dusted my shelf this time I think it was love 

[Chorus]",Wish,2001
Will Hoge,"You say that it's over this time for good 
But this time around you know that I wish 
That you would not call me on the phone
I need to get used to being alone 
Now you tell me you want me to be your friend 
Don't you know I'll be your fool again 
You say now you're gone and you won't be back 
This time around I'm just a little bit smarter than that 
Just because you've packed your bags 
That doesn't mean that you won't return 
That's the lesson I learned the last time I let you back in 
Don't you know I'll be your fool again 

My friends tell me that they doubt it 
When I tell them I can learn to live without it 
They say it's a game that I can't win 
So you say you found a new man and he treats you fine 
You say he brings you flowers and bottles of cheap red wine 
You say you like the way he wears his hair 
But don't you know I wouldn't care if you ever walk out on him 
Don't you know I'll be your fool again",Your Fool,2001
Will Hoge,"Katie's got a new dress she wears too tight
Her daddy said no, but her momma said it's alright
Let 'em fuss and fight

She don't care what they say's right or wrong
She's gonna stay out all night long
All night long

She don't care about books or school
No, she just wants to rock and roll baby 
She's no fool
You're so cool

Well I know the way you feel now baby can't you see
Well I know the way you want your little tangled web to weave

Black lipstick she got a fake I.D.
You know the one that says Ms. Jones is turning 23
Oh baby take a look and see",All Night Long,2003
Will Hoge,"May the sunlight find your face
Even when the rain does fall
And get back on your feet again
Every time you slip and fall
Keep your heart wide open
And always taking in
And even when it's broken
Be strong enough to fix it up again

Oh little baby girl
Sweet little baby girl
I wish I could hold your hand in this great big world
Oh little baby girl

And I hope your hands are steady
And never need to make a fist
And I hope that when you're ready
You get one never ending kiss
And I hope that deep inside of you
There's a sweet eternal song
And I hope the words are pretty
And that you'll always sing along

And I hope your friends are many
And your laughter's always loud
To help you when you're lonely
And pick you up when you're down
I hope your eyes shine bright love
And learn to see the light
Take the time to listen
Decide yourself what's wrong or right

Sweet little baby girl
Be strong in this great big world
Oh little baby girl",Baby Girl,2003
Will Hoge,"Night ends
Another day begins 
She feels just like she did the day before
She finds her coat, she grabs her hat 
She picks her stockings up from off the bathroom floor
With a plastic smile on, closes the door and she's gone away
She hears all the things that they say, but talk is cheap so she gives it away

She don't want to get better
No no
She just wants to have some fun
She'll do anything the boys will let her
Oh no
She just wants to be the one
Yeah yeah yeah yeah

She finds a bar that says it's open so she takes a step inside
A man with a tall drink and a Wall Street haircut says that he can give her a ride
With a plastic smile on, closes the door and she's gone away
She hears all the things that they say, but talk is cheap so she gives it away

Everybody wants to be a star in somebody's dream
But you can't get there darling down upon your knees",Be the One,2003
Will Hoge,"I threw away a lifetime you laughed and called it a sin
There ain't ever gonna be a way to work it out not after a night like this
I've been waiting on your call now just the silence and me
I know you want me to chase you around but I'm so tired of asking you please

I'm through with this I'll forget your kiss and move on
There will be no sleepless nights I'll be alright from now on
I'm better off now that you're gone
Better off now that you're gone

You put me so far down girl I couldn't even stand on my own
Ghosts of you would come back to me whenever I was alone
Now the candles have all burned out and the doors are locked and chained
Have no doubts this time I've figured out a way to end all these games

Nights filled with empty bottles and picking up broken glass
Well I should have known from the very first night that this just would never last",Better off Now (That You're Gone),2003
Will Hoge,"There's a storm brewing out on the open sea
Sweeping its way here to you and me
But all the lights are out and the streets are dark
And there's a soul without a fire trying to find a spark
And this heartbreak season, it's leaving its mark on me

But it doesn't have to be that way
It's not the way that it has to be
It's coming over the walls and I'm drowning in it, can't you see?
It's not the way that it has to be
Doesn't have to be that way

Black night sitting heavy all around
I got a mind full of heartaches and hand me downs
I got a freight train screaming inside my head
That says you can't find love in a stranger's bed
And my mouth is full of all the words that I wish I had said

It's so much harder now
That the blues skies have gone away
I wish I had just one more day

Whiskey like water flowing down a drain
And I'm wasted as a candle in a hurricane
But you can't stop something that's this far gone
Goodbyes are easier than I was wrongs
And suicide ain't a matter of degree",Doesn't Have to Be That Way,2003
Will Hoge,"I know it's late
It's the lonely hour
But I've seen your window
And I've knocked on your door
There's no need to hide
I'm a love lost disaster
And sooner or later you're gonna find out
Just what I'm here after

Hey tonight 
Say that you still love me
The way that you always did before
Hey tonight 
Say the fire is still burning
And in the morning pretend that we don't see the ashes on the floor

There's blood on these streets
I know that I'm losing
My heart's been left open
And I'm falling away
I know that I could
I could change if I have to
But I've been here so long, I think I've learned to like it this way

Into the ocean and with no light
I'm sinking this ship tonight
I'm going down fast
Won't you hold on tight

Don't turn on the lights
Don't look out from inside
Because I know how this ends
And I just can't stand it this way",Hey Tonight,2003
Will Hoge,"How would this be if I was alone tonight
Maybe then my love everything would turn out right
I wish that this were easy, but you know that it never is
It seems like hearts get broken during things like this

And if you see her walking down along these streets
Her body softly swaying to her heart's broken beats
And if you see her tell her that I'm doing fine
And tell her if she feels like talking, she should call me sometime

And I can't fight it anymore
I can't stop it once it starts

Well it's a shame babe
Well it's a shame babe
Well it's a shame babe
The way we've torn it all apart

And if you see her let her know I wish her well
And if things will get much better tell her only time will tell
Cause if she's lonely well I'm alright
Cause you know
When it falls down I'll be there to pick it up one more time",It's a Shame,2003
Will Hoge,"Wake in the morning 
Lord I'm drunken with the dawn
Waiting on a train that I know runs no more
Just outside of Baltimore

Or Chicago, well I just don't know
Everyday it's harder when you spend your time alone
Then there's no one ever there to say hello
When the sweet morning sun does come
And it always seems to come

One day I will rise
High above it all
She will catch me if I fall
And I know I will always be the King of Grey

Sweet promises of springtime turn the brown lies of early fall
Orbiting around a love that I once called my own
Never have I felt so small
And maybe it's the wintertime come to make me feel so cold
But there is just a slight chance that this pain comes from watching smiles fade away
They fade away

One day I will rise
High above it all
She will catch me if I fall
And I will live today
And I will watch her dancing in the sun
My whole world's come undone
And I know I will always be the King of Grey

Bring me summertime and take away this pain of mine
This emptiness is far too much 
Won't somebody please come pick me up",King of Grey,2003
Will Hoge,"Excuse me
Do you have the time?
'Cause I've been here waiting since a quarter after nine
And it is not true love that I'm hoping I will find
No the truth is that I just don't want to be alone tonight

My how your eyes sparkle
Have you heard that one before
'Cause if you have don't you worry I know at least one million more
Like the one about your father stealing stars out of the sky
And if I could buy you just one more drink I think I'd have the strength to tell these lies

And it must feel so fine
To get what you want every time
I would if I were more like James Dean

Then I could walk right up to you
And say hello how do you do
Then you'd come back home with me
But I'm just not that cool you see
I'm just not that cool you see

So for now I'll just sit here and wait alone
And hope that maybe you'll say hello
As the night just creeps along
And I don't want to know about the clothes you wear
I want to see you in the morning with the sunlight through your hair",Not That Cool,2003
Will Hoge,"Here it comes, another lonely night 
I'm waking up in my clothes
I know this place is poison, but I'm coming back for a lethal dose
I got fist full of chances and a washed up angel to fill me up with bad advice
Sex and God and lust and I just hope that maybe I can get this right

'Cause I want and I need
Do you really want to see me bleed
'Cause I can't get nothin' from your secondhand heart
I get nothing from your secondhand heart

Filling pages with the same old secrets 
I still want just you

Do you think about me too?
I want something that I can hold onto 
I don't care if it's wrong or right

Where I sleep with a bottle and I wake up dead
I got a hole in the bottom of both my shoes
Hey my step's been heavy since I heard the news

And I know just what you'll say
When I tell you that I'm sorry that I let you get away
Well you'll know I found out
That you're someone else's baby now

I see you when I walk down the street
Your smile's in the face of everyone I meet
Oh and it tears me up to know that he's touching you
And learning all the secrets that I once knew

Do you still leave your clothes piled on the floor
Maybe now you're different than you were before
You got a new way of walking and a different kiss

Said he drove a truck, Momma said he was handsome and tall
But to me he was never more than just a picture on the wall
And for my 16th birthday all he could give me was a call

Momma was a looker, that's what the men would always say
She must have tried them all out once Daddy went away
And to me our back door was just some beat up, turning page
And I just sat there dying inside, there was nothing left to say

And the world gets cold
And the best that I could hope for is just to die when I get old
And these four walls drive me insane
Sometimes home is where the heart breaks

Momma died from cancer when I was 22
And this house was all she left me, so what else could I do
I got a job out paving highways and fell all in love with you
And now months later there's a nursery in what used to be my room

Now I come home, we don't talk, and you cry yourself to sleep
And I sit here 'til the liquor finally gets the best of me
Then I crumple down beside you and kiss your tear-stained cheek
And realize this house is just a black hole and all I ever do is sink

And the tears fall down
And the world gets cold

Will Jennings,"Here's to gamblers
Who hold to the game
Through the hard times
They don't lose their aim
And they hope for time on their side
And they keep a ticket to ride

They keep watching for signs in the land
They keep watching for signs in the land
And they stand there watching the sky
And they stand there ready to fly

Here's to never letting go
Though sometimes it does get lonely

I still walk out in the morning light
Just to see what is there
I hear music in silent nights
Searching I find a reason to care
One heart moving still the same
Still in the game

Here's to lovers who reach for it all
Never matching the rise with the fall
And they just can't leave it alone
And they want it all till it's gone
Here's to players who can't leave their song
And it haunts them
Their night is so long
Cause there's music there in their mind
From a world they're trying to find

All lined up in a wedding group
'Ere we are for a photograph
We're all dressed up in a morning suit
All trying hard not to laugh
Since the early caveman in his fur
Took a trip to Gretna Green
There's always been a photographer
To record the 'appy scene

'Old it, flash, bang, wallop, what a picture
What a picture, what a photograph
Poor old soul, blimey, what a joke
Hat blown off in a cloud of smoke
Clap 'ands, stamp yer feet
Bangin' on the big bass drum

The same thing 'appened long ago
When man was in his prime
And what went on we only know
From the snaps he took at the time
When Adam and Eve in their birthday suit
Decided to get wed
As Adam was about to taste the fruit
The man with the cam'ra said

'Old it, flash, bang, wallop, what a picture
What a picture, what a photograph
Poor old Eve, there with nothing on
Face all red and 'er fig leaf gone 
Clap 'ands, stamp yer feet
Bangin' on the big bass drum, W-e-e-a-ay

You've read it in a folio
Or seen it in a Shakespeare play
How Juliet fell for Romeo
In the merry month of May
And as 'e climbed the orchard wall
To reach 'is lady fair
As he tumbled, she began to bawl
As he floated through the air

'Old it, flash, bang, wallop, what a picture
What a picture, what a photograph
Poor young chap, what a night 'e spent
Tights all torn and 'is rapier bent

King 'Enry the Eighth had several wives
Including Anne Boleyn
And he kept an album of their lives
With all their photos in
As Anne Boleyn was on her knees
Dressed in her very best frock
King 'Enry shouted, ""Smile, Dear, please""
As 'er 'ead rolled off the block

'Old it, flash, bang, wallop, what a picture
What a picture, what a photograph
Comes the print in a little while
Lost 'er 'ead, but she kept 'er smile

When Napoleon married Josephine
There was just the same to-do
He galloped home from the battle scene
All the way from Waterloo
And as he came from orf 'is 'orse
To the boudoir where she sat
She said to 'im, in French of course
As he took of his big cocked 'at

'Old it, flash, bang, wallop, what a picture
What a picture, what a photograph
There she was, with a big Hussar
All caught up in 'er oh-la-la

The myst'ry of their fading light 
That shines upon our caravan 
 
Sleep upon my shoulder as we creep 
Across the sand so I may keep 
The mem'ry of our caravan 
 
This is so exciting 
You are so inviting 
Resting in my arms 
As I thrill to the magic charms 
Of you beside me here beneath the blue 
My dream of love is coming true 
Within our desert caravan",Caravan,2004
Will Martin,"Where do you start? How do you separate the present from the past?
How do you deal with all the thing you thought would last? That didn't last
With bits of memories scattered here and there
I look around and don't know where to start

Which books are yours?
Which tapes and dreams belong to you and which are mine?
Our lives are tangled like the branches of a vine that intertwine
So many habits that we'll have to break
And yesterday's we'll have to take apart

One day there'll be a song or something in the air again
To catch me by surprise and you'll be there again
A moment in what might have been

Where do you start? Do you allow yourself a little time to cry?
Or do you close your eyes and kiss it all goodbye? I guess you try
And though I don't know where and don't know when
I'll find myself in love again
I promise there will always be a little place no one will see
A tiny part within my heart, that stays in love with you

Is come and gone away
In Paris and Rome

Mmmmmmmm

Maybe surrounded by
A million people I
Still feel all alone
I just want to go home
Oh I miss you, you know

And I've been keeping all the letters that I wrote to you
Each one a line or two
""I'm fine baby, how are you?""
Well I would send them but I know that it?s just not enough
My words were cold and flat
And you deserve more than that

But I want to go home
Mmmm, I've got to go home

Let me go home
I'm just too far from where you are
I want to come home

And I feel just like I'm living someone else's life
It's like I just stepped outside
When everything was going right
And I know just why you could not 
Come along with me
But this was not your dream
But you always believe in me

Another winter day has come 
And gone away
And even Paris and Rome
And I want to go home

Everything to be a powerful memory
(so I could carry all that we'd been with me)

So I brought her to the swamp she loved so well
Where I gently placed her in it
I brought her soul to ease with kisses
And I said to her as I's about to begin it

Don't cry
Don't feel
You won't die
Because I don't think death's real
It's good
It's mine
And it should be
At your heels all of the time

And who will take it down? the freedom it brings
And drape it all around me her voice is my very

Dissolve

And stars fell on Alabama last night
I never planned in my imagination a situation so heavenly
A fairy land where no one else could enter
And in the center just you and me, dear
My heart beat like a hammer, my arms wound around you tight
And stars fell on Alabama last night
 
We lived our little drama, we kissed in a field of white
And stars fell on Alabama last night

A fairy land where no one else could enter

Will Powers,"You may be a sharp dresser, 
You may be a fantastic dancer,
You may be a lively conversationalist,
But what happens at the end of the evening when the time comes to show how you feel?
Unless you can kiss with confidence all your fancy dressing, dancing and talking won't get you a second date.

I'd meet a boy I really liked
I'd start to win his heart
Come the time to kiss good-night
I always fell apart

I'd giggle like I had no brains
Or else I'd start to cough
I thought my perspiration stains
Would turn a fellow off

She was nervous
She was too shy
She was breathless
Lips were too dry
Hands were shaking
Didn't know why

Do you want to kiss this person?
Then be honest - what is keeping you from kissing with confidence?
Worries. Some of them can be put to rest if you ask yourself a few simple questions before kissing.

Is your breath fresh?
Do your have spinach on your teeth?
Is your deodorant strong enough?

You may also find yourself worrying about what will happen once you are in the act of kissing.
Will your stomach growl? Will your braces lock? Will you be able to prolong the kiss and still breathe?

Will I spoil it with my overbite?
Will our noses bump in the moonlight?
When our lips meet, will they fit right?

These worries are best cleared from the mind by the romance chant method,
a technique which will also place your lips naturally in kissing position.
Hableme el unico del mundo.
Digame: comoe te hare ese sonido. Tan glorioso.
Que aun hoba con anticipation de el. Me ha reducio a un bestia.
Grunedo. Entusiomandose why paliptando.
Practice this chant in the morning as you rise, in the evening as you retire and just before a date.

Once you have mastered these techniques there is only one worry left - will it go too far?
It never will if you remain alert to these danger signals - heavy breathing, wandering hands, strong heartbeats.
A nice way to maintain self-control without offending the other person is to say -- 'I'm not ready to handle what I think is coming',
then you both go home and daydream.
Tomorrow you can start again fresh. Just remember - you can not get pregnant from kissing.

I put an end to worrying, I learned the way from Will
He showed me kissing with confidence is an acquired skill
When my boyfriends get too hot I can cool 'em down
Now I'm kissing with confidence everywhere in town

In the schoolyard
At the front door
In the laundromat
At the drug store

At the car wash
In the back seat
At the Dairy Queen
On a side street

In the basement
On the rooftop
At the drive in
At the stop and shop

On the back porch
At the candy store
On the boardwalk
By the seashore

In the balcony
At the malt shop
In the parking lot
On the blacktop

Once you can kiss with confidence, think of others these techniques will help.

Nothing came true

There was a wall you had to find

You'll surrender

Nobody hears, no one's concerned
One day it's clear and then you burn

Will Saul,"We all came out to Montreux
On the Lake Geneva shoreline
To make records with a mobile
We didn't have much time
Frank Zappa and the Mothers
Were at the best place around
But some stupid with a flare gun
Burned the place to the ground
Smoke on the water, fire in the sky

They burned down the gambling house
It died with an awful sound
Funky Claude was running in and out
Pulling kids out the ground
When it all was over
We had to find another place
But Swiss time was running out
It seemed that we would lose the race
Smoke on the water, fire in the sky

We ended up at the Grand Hotel
It was empty cold and bare
But with the Rolling truck Stones thing just outside
Making our music there
With a few red lights and a few old beds
We make a place to sweat
No matter what we get out of this
I know we'll never forget

Money can't break us but the places it can take us
Big will in the limelight rhyme tight
And we goin' have some fun tonight

With a sweet smell

Can us girls roll wit y'all

Gently with the Caress on your hand 
And that Kimono that I bought you on my trip to Japan 
Sunshine peekin' through the venitian blinds 

Four years, and like wine, you got finer with time 
I got a question, if the prodda dressin' and the Gucci 
All got goes, and the freeze on the Lucci 
I mean real bad girl, I'm talking rougher than rough 

Do you think it'd be enough if we just had us? 
Don't answer quick, think about it cause I'm askin' for real 
Golddiggers goin' to hear this song drivin' and crash at the wheel 
Forever is a long time, so far we gettin' along fine 

No car I ever drove, no ice I ever saw 
No music I ever made, ain't nothin' I wanted more 
We could deal with whatever together 
Sunshine, all that other weather, when we chasin' forever 

[Chorus]
I want to stay with you forever 
I want to spend all my life with only you 
I want to stay, lets stay together 
Chasing forever, with only you 

Chasin' forever, a buckwild, endeavorous scene 
Should we pursue with somethin' real or just chasin' a dream 
Or casin' the scene 
Fore I die I plan 

To see your soul and eternity in the palm of my hands 
Now as a man, there's certain things I'm lackin for sure 
But I'm committed to growin and coming at you mature 
In the future, I know it ain't gonna be all good 

But when we feelin' the hurt, if we willin' to work 
The eight ball will never turn to see us behind 
Though I ain't no knight, and my armor don't shine 
My mom said the lynch pin of love is trust 

An taught me monogomy is uh, monogamous 
Plus, for you dinner by candlelight 
Now don't commit before you sure you understand me right 
It's a race to a strange place, most see never 
It's a chase we gotta make together, forever 

[Chorus]

Now you would think after all my heartbreaks I'd be cruel 
Hiding behind my ego, evil but no 
Much the contrary, I'm very much certain 
You searchin' for joy, it's on the other side of hurtin' 

Finally found a person, worthy of all 
Instead of pushin' me down, you want to cushion my fall 
Your eyes could make the sun rise, all the birds sing 
Seal it with a kiss, bind it with a ring 

More carrats than even bugs could eat in a week 
An the ribbon in the sky, close your eyes don't peek 
I'll tell you what I see in the future 
A hacienda so cute with, five little kids callin' you mom and callin' me dad 

Havin more good times than JJ had 
Judging by the look in your eyes, you see it 
Let no man sever, welcome to forever

When I released my first single back in like '86
People was like oh you know that's popcorn and you know they weak
You know then I mess around I go world trade on them
Bangin' out them multi-plastic still got negativity to bring
My thing is you can't say nothing nice don't say nothing

Take your place allow me to flex a taste
As my accomplishments bring up my comp like mase
Face me the star of stage and TV
My face be seen in almost every country

Grammy winner soon to be oscar nominee
Who he that's dressed jiggy straight from west Philly
Thought I was whack 'cause I wanted to act
Now every brother and his mother that rap be trying to do that

The ill kid
Hundred million dollar bill kid
The one you love to chill with come on keep it real kid
Don't try to act like this summer at the greek

You won't be bumpin' the big Willie in your jeep
I know y'all still feel me 
Really don't act silly
Thought I feel off just becuase I left Philly

Took a break from the rap thing went on hiatus
I picked up the art of acting and multiplied papers
I chilled on silk sofas chatting with Operah
She asked me if it's true that me and Jeff broke up

While y'all kids busy playing drug pimp and playa
I was at my crib in Barbados chillin' with Jada
Vertex is me the magnanamous
God you sayin' damn I've always been a fan of his

Y'all know how it is oh wait hold up y'all don't
Look here y'all don't say nothing than I won't

With some more hot top notch ---- for you to cop
No more mr. nice guy
My whole life I've been smiling when I felt like whiling

Jealousy swinging on me made his attack
(he soft he whack man that ain't real rap)
You believe that
It hurt me at first but it's cool

Took the insults feed it to my ego for fuel
Now everywhere I turn a dead end
Hundred women coming at me waving pads and pens
And they be screaming out

(oh my lord)
Did you see it's that brother from
(ID4)
Now can I please get 

(a picture and your signature)
Sure you can miss
(oh my god my girlfriends they ain't gonna beleive this)
Worldwide wait nah hold up galactic

Hear my name don't nothing change but the accent
Bangok to Madagascar they wanna see me
Prince epe in Spain Japan I'm cota eshe
I like my steaks thick and my jets private

And my son to ride in the cockpit
I know he's only four taking lessons from the pilot
While I'm on my cell with my broker getting stock tips
Find a magazine and I read the hottest gossip

Man who'd a thought my life would be such an interesting topic
Well y'all know how it is wait hold up y'all don't

Make sure my voice sounding crisp in your tweeters

Fifty inch sony to watch Siskel and Ebert
'Cause I'm about to get two thumbs ten toes one knee and probobly a couple
Of elbows

'Cause yo I'm the man and the whole world knows
Rock film fests to vos and rap shows
All the critics jealous people and back-stabbers

Took a hour just ta get the carseat in right
People drivin' all fast, got me kinda upset

Got you home safe, placed you in your basonette
That night I don't think one wink I slept
As I slipped out my bed, to your crib I crept
Touched your head gently, felt my heart melt

'Cause I know I loved you more than life itself
Then to my knees, and I begged the Lord please
Let me be a good daddy, all he needs
Love, knowledge, discipline too
I pledge my life to you

[Chorus]
Just the two of us, we can make it if we try
Just the two of us, (Just the two of us)
Just the two of us, building castles in the sky
Just the two of us, you and I

Five years old, bringin comedy
Everytime I look at you I think man, a little me
Just like me
Wait an see gonna be tall

Makes me laugh cause you got your dads ears an all
Sometimes I wonder, what you gonna be
A General, a Doctor, maybe a MC
Haha, I want to kiss you all the time

But I will test that butt when you cut outta line, trudat
Uh-uh-uh why you do dat?
I try to be a tough dad, but you be makin me laugh
Crazy joy, when I see the eyes of my baby boy

I pledge to you, I will always do
Everything I can
Show you how to be a man
Dignity, integrity, honor an

An I don't mind if you lose, long as you came with it
An you can cry, ain't no shame it it
It didn't work out with me an your mom
But yo, push come to shove

You was conceived in love
So if the world attacks, and you slide off track
Remember one fact, I got your back

[Chorus]

It's a full-time job to be a good dad
You got so much more stuff than I had
I gotta study just to keep with the changin times
101 Dalmations on your CD-ROM

See me-I'm
Tryin to pretend I know
On my PC where that CD go
But yo, ain't nuthin promised, one day I'll be gone

Feel the strife, but trust life does go wrong
But just in case
It's my place
To impart

One day some girl's gonna break your heart
And ooh ain't no pain like from the opposite sex
Gonna hurt bad, but don't take it out on the next, son
Throughout life people will make you mad

Disrespect you and treat you bad
Let God deal with the things they do
'Cause hate in your heart will consume you too
Always tell the truth, say your prayers

Hold doors, pull out chairs, easy on the swears
You're living proof that dreams do come true
I love you and I'm here for you

Excuse me, Will, Will one more question, my brother
Look I see you brought your DJ Jazzy Jeff with you now keep it real

In this salsa-merengue melting pot
Hottest club in the city, and it's right on the beach
Temperature get to ya, it's about to reach
Five-hundred degrees
In the Carribean seas
With the hot mamis screaming ""¡Ay papi!""
Every time I come to town, they be spottin' me
In the drop Bentley, ain't no stoppin' me
So, cash in your dough
And flow to this fashion show
Pound for pound anywhere you go
Yo, ain't no city in the world like this
An if you ask how I know I gots ta plead the fifth ""Miami""

And New York is the city that we know don't sleep
And we all know that L.A. and Philly stay jiggy

Y'all don't understand
I never seen so many Dominican women with cinnimon tans
Mira, this is the plan
Take a walk on the beach, draw a heart in the sand
Gimmie your hand
Damn, you look sexy
Let's go to my yacht, in the West Keys
Ride my jetskis, loungin' in the palm trees
'Cause you gotta have cheese for the summerhouse piece on South Beach
Water so clear, you can see to the bottom
Hundred-thousand dollar cars, e'ybody got em

I'll test the flow of the world's MC's 

I'll hit you out the ball park 
You just all talk 
Don't be lookin at my script, you can't play my part 
See I'm a rapper that's an actor 

You act rap with no heart 
The way that I compose those flows like Mozart 
Gets somthin like a symphony, when I'm orchestratin' em 
Ever since the days of me an Jeff at the Paladium 

All my life I've been the cream of the crop 
Shoppin a dream, now I got a crop full of cream 
I raise mics for the flow of it, you know the show of it

Yo,
I knew this girl named Alana with mad persona
She delt with reality never fed it to the drama
I met her through my nigga named Jermaine Palmer
Who knew her through his peoples by the Baltimore harbor
Alana was a Marylan' thurough and attractive
Shorty that's relaxed with me and kickin back
Wif a phat flick to cool out
Was stressed cause the game'll make you wanna pull a tool out
And go the old school route
But all-a that cease - when that piece checkin the jewel out
A bruver was charged - light a spliff and listen to the dabarge
Let the shorty hit me wif a massage to annoint
Lubricatin my maridian points that was the Summer easy to remember
Alana was all up on - to read the gender how I used to back bender
She even told her best friend Blinda from Virginia
Who asked me if I had a cousin I could recomend-a
But as time float on we grew more mature - and further apart
When I began to do tours, we lost contact
And slowly parted - reminissin of when it started
It keep me feelin heavy hearted - a stolen moment periodic
Addicted to her presence like a narcotic
Though I wonder if she ever got it - the hypnotic
That faded like a dream sequence that pursuaded
Beyond being infatuated - spiritually intoxicated
Comps are dated - I concentrated
On how to get in touch with her
Cuase the fact of the matter remain that I miss the hypnotic

Her number but knowin it's been awhile it's hard to link
I figure what she probly think and soon start to drink
Fightin the feelin I'm concealin apparently I first appealin
Later revealin to be deeper - resistance increasingly weaker
The essence of life is more than just mic's and puffin reefa

I'm tryin to touch ya only if I can reach ya
I hit this kid I sign up on his beepa
And ask him if a had a chance to speak ta
Jermaine Palmer who fathers a preacha
To make the story short me and my man soon ran
Into each other von the humble at a show in San Fran
I said ""Yo Palma, when did you last see Alana""?
He offer me a seat and attempts to make me calma
When he began to break it down my mind start to wander
Response beyond somber incredible crushed
Kinda feelin on my shoulder - that of a boulder
To find out that her life was over - it made the room feel colder
I thought I could get wif her when she was a little older
But she a victim of the wicked system that controlled-a it's all chaotic

Let God deal with the things they do
'Cause hate in your heart will consume you too
Always tell the truth, say your prayers
Hold doors, pull out chairs, easy on the swears
You're living proof that dreams do come true
I love you and I'm here for you

Miami, uh, uh
South Beach, bringin the heat, uh
Haha, can y'all feel that
Can y'all feel that
Jig it out, uh

Here I am in the place where I come let go
Miami the bass and the sunset low
Everyday like a mardi gras, everybody party all day
No work all play, okay
So we sip a little something, lay to rest the spill
Me an Charlie at the bar runnin' up a high bill
Nothin' less than ill, when we dress to kill
Every time the ladies pass, they be like ""hi Will""
Can y'all feel me, all ages and races
Real sweet faces
Every different nation, Spanish, Hatian, Indian, Jamaican
Black, White, Cuban, and Asian
I only came for two days of playing
But every time I come I always wind up stayin'
This the type of town I could spend a few days in
Miami the city that keeps the roof blazin'

Party in the city where the heat is on
All night, on the beach till the break of dawn
""Welcome to Miami""
""Bienvenidos a Miami""
Bouncin' in the club where the heat is on
All night, on the beach till the break of dawn
I'm goin to Miami
""Welcome to Miami""

Yo I heard the rainstorms ain't nothin' to mess with
But I can't feel a drip on the strip, it's a trip
Ladies half-dressed, fully equipped
And they be screamin out, ""Will we loved your last hit""
So I'm thinkin' I'mma scoot me somethin' hot
In this salsa-merengue melting pot
Hottest club in the city, and it's right on the beach
Temperature get to ya, it's about to reach
Five-hundred degrees
In the Carribean seas
With the hot mamis screaming ""¡Ay papi!""
Every time I come to town, they be spottin' me
In the drop Bentley, ain't no stoppin' me
So, cash in your dough
And flow to this fashion show
Pound for pound anywhere you go
Yo, ain't no city in the world like this
An if you ask how I know I gots ta plead the fifth ""Miami""

Party in the city where the heat is on
All night, on the beach till the break of dawn
""Welcome to Miami""
""Bienvenidos a Miami""
Bouncin' in the club where the heat is on
All night, on the beach till the break of dawn
I'm goin to Miami
""Welcome to Miami""

Don't get me wrong, Chi-town got it goin' on
And New York is the city that we know don't sleep
And we all know that L.A. and Philly stay jiggy
But on the sneak, Miami bringin' heat for real
Y'all don't understand
I never seen so many Dominican women with cinnimon tans
Mira, this is the plan
Take a walk on the beach, draw a heart in the sand
Gimmie your hand
Damn, you look sexy
Let's go to my yacht, in the West Keys
Ride my jetskis, loungin' in the palm trees
'Cause you gotta have cheese for the summerhouse piece on South Beach
Water so clear, you can see to the bottom
Hundred-thousand dollar cars, e'ybody got em
Ain't no surprise in the club to see Sly, Stallone
Miami, my second home

The maestro 
Nice flow 
Hot like nitro 
Cool as ice though 
That type of daichotimy 
Why'all know it's gotta be 
Who else could it be, but me 
Rub your eyes behold the big billy 
It's dream supreme beamed straight from philly 
It's the eclectic female attractor rapper slash actor 
Right back at ya 
Into the next millennium many come but few are chosen 
See me servin' like the u.s. open 
Another type of hustler listed at blockbuster 
Go and ask a movie usher 
Who is he, he or she 
Sfp, movies cd's, and tv's, but uh uh 
'cause today I take a break from that 
As I roll where a tank of gas'll take me at 
I used to rock these 
Red, I rock z's 
Now I rock the mb's 
With twelves and v's 
Today sun high 
Up in the sky 
From ny 
La la to mi

Just cruisin' 
Where, baby, I don't care 
Just cruisin' 
As long as you take me there 
Just cruisin' 
Somewhere to clear my mind 
Just cruisin' 
Just cruisin' 

Easy wrote a sixty 
Flossin' ninety degrees 
Sony cartridges, ten cd's each 
Reach to the beach 
South side leanin' 
It ain't often I'm off and I'm eager for the top down 
Drop down 
Got me hot now heated up can't stop now 
What up cutie what sure sure is cooking now 
(wait a minute, don't I know your girl?)
Can't hurt lookin' no 
Pop cd's, be B-I-g's, and Tupac's 
While cruisin' on the blocks 
Hittin' the hot spots 
Got my celly on o-f-f 
Golden arches got my belly goin' oh yes yes 
So let's just ease on down ease on down the road 
No pager on my hip 
As I rollin' my whip 
Cause today I'm on the solo creek 
Man, why you think I be workin' so hard all week 

[Chorus]
I'm just cruisin' 
Baby, want to take a ride 
Just cruisin' 
So we can set it off tonight
Just cruisin' 
What better way to spend my day 
Just cruisin' 
Just cruisin' 
I'm just cruisin' 
Where, baby, I don't care

As long as you take me there

Just cruisin' 
Just cruisin' 

Sun settin' in the s-k-why 
Must say I've had the best day I 
Tryin' to find an exit 
A place to chill not to hectic 
So I can spend some time with will 
Let the sun shine to the moonlight clearin' my mind 
Soul search, see what I find 
If I'm being the best lover and friend 
Am I being the best daddy I can 
I pray I am 
And I feel good today 
Reminisce as I'm cruisin' around the way 
Roll tight passed the park where I used to play 
Can't think of a better way to spend my day 
Uh, still findin' my way 
Still growin' 
Petrol rowin' 
Move soon showin' 
Gots to get goin' losing the light 
And the freaks come out at night

31st of December
Man I remember when the ball dropped for 90
Now it's 9-9, ten years behind me
What's gonna happen?
Don't nobody know
We'll see when the clock gets to 12-0-0

Everybody was drinking
The house was screaming
And the bass was shaking
And it won't be long
Till everybody knowing
That twelve o'clock the roof will be blowing
Drinks on me, up the cups, and
Midnight coming full thrust, and
Dick Clark holding it down, and
The second hand rolling around (Na, na, na, na)
Hundred thousands deep, world wide press
Hate to be the man that gotta clean this mess
Same resolution, get the money
Ain't where we've been, it's where we gonna be
Get ready to hum Auld Lang Syne
Cause a person that know the words is hard to find
First soul train line of the year
Four, three, two, one

I remember trying to count how old I'd be
When the clock struck twelve in the year two g
Medianoche finally near
This will be that anthem amongst the cheers
Just the man to usher it in
Big Will bringing the heat
K-Ci bringing the plan
Ringing it in, waiting for the ball to drop
That 2000 vault we breaking the lock
Let hip-hop keep blazing the charts
May the past keep a warm spot in your heart
May the future hold more joy then pain
Hands in the air waiting for confetti to rain

Its here and I like it
Gonna pack the dance floor
Rock the dance floor

Here it comes another year
Come on everyone, new millennium
Here it comes another year
Everyone, new millennium

There's a party tonight
Everybody was drinking
The house was screaming
And the bass was shaking
And it won't be long
Till everybody knowing at twelve o'clock
At 12 o'clock
Say what? Say what? Say what? What?

Here it comes another year
Come on everyone, new millennium
Here it comes another year
Everyone, new millennium

Will Smith,"(Ooh, Ohh) 

Here I stand before you - brown. 

Color of the mountains 

Colossal as the earth 

Wrapped so deliciously within my own joy and misery 

Feathers of my wings paralyzed by the distance of my mind 

Here I stand before you, the color of the night 

Frozen by the potential of me 

(Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh-uh-uh-uh-uh) An Afro Angel 



Afro Angel off your pedestal from perchin above 

You on the prowl now, downtown, searchin for love 

In all the wrong places, outside your radio stations 

Hopin he with new hit single, is tryin to mingle 

Today, he is in your town, puttin it down 

You in the car with your friends, followin my limo around 

Puttin a bug in my boy's ear, your ""S"" is for free 

You'll do anything for Omar or Phil, bring you to me 

And then me, hypnotized by the devil as well 

Hold out my hand as an invitation into my hotel 

No need to RSVP, place your hand in my palm 

As all your girlfriends getting jealous, damn she landed the bomb 

Willing to trade your spirit for some crass, whack wage 

Something small, something simple as a pass back stage 

But now I lay me, down to creep 

And I - pray the Lord my soul to keep 



Chorus: 

Afro Angel, born against the world 

You don't have to sell your soul and throw away your pride 

Afro Angel, sent from heaven above 

Never forget that you are loved 

You know that you are loved 



Lil Bobby got a gun now, age fifteen 

Destined to spend his life inside a cage it seems 

Rage inside, pride, been denied respect 

He can't take it though he gotta earn it 

But he ain't learned that yet 

Out on the town, reckless abandon he's been bullied before 

But now he straps, and no more 

Attitude high 

Flexin on every guy that walk by 

But don't start pal 

'cause if the gun came from the whiz, Cowardly Lion, got heart now 

Let's pull it on a stranger 

Ahh, fun for the crew 

Surprised when he realized, damn dude got one too 

Smile's upside down now, games ain't so cute 

Bobby's a deer in a headlights 

Pump, drop it or I'll shoot 

Then like a sniper, cleanin his rifle, Bobby disobeys his commands 

One shot rings out (gunshot) then only the stranger stands 

Could of sworn Bobby's blood formed the shape of an angel's wings 

But for what? 



Chorus: 

Afro Angel, born against the world 

You don't have to sell your soul and throw away your pride 

Afro Angel, sent from heaven above 

Never forget that you are loved 

You know that you are loved 



Back in high school, Tamika was the sweetest, the bomb 

Hot to death, though in tenth grade a teenage mom 

Knocked up by some thug named Russ in the drug game 

But had the cutest kid you ever seen 

Then all the pressure from her mom 

She stepped to Russ 

Told him it's either them drugs or us 

Either them thugs or us 

The ultimatum, either continue bein a thug in the world 

Or start lovin your girl 

And say God, bear me witness, no doubt, lovin ya dear 

But to go from $50 Gees a week to $30 Gees a year 

That ain't happenin 

I guess he wasn't that strong 

He came back the next week, and the whole family was gone 

Yo they straight moved away, without as little as a word 

Well, needless to say, Russ was a little perturbed 

Then in a fury put the pressure on her girlfriend Shawn 

And like a clumsy chef she spilled the beans on where they had gone 



Upstate Schenectady, 

Tamika answered the door 

It was the last person she expected to be 

They just stared 

He said you love me for me? 

You can do without the cars, vacations, and jewelry? 

Down with me? 

Period. 

Through life's stress and strife 

She said, Yeah, He said in that case 

Would you please be my wife? 

Then like a sign from the sky, the baby cried 

Like an angel sings 

I love y'all more than anything 



Chorus: 

Afro Angel, born against the world 

You don't have to sell your soul and throw away your pride

You know that you are loved

Cause I'm out the door for sure approach me
Wave your hand to come over trying to coach me (what?)
Why you in the V-I, E-V-E too fly to drop by
Get up off your clothes and cruise by
Shades high, nothing while you're with bluffing your team
Every time I'm with you blushing, your smile gleam
You don't think I know you noticing me
Come on get closer to be
Be bold take a dose of the Eve
If you're ready for your part

No frontin' if it is illegal for you to be that fine
I be McGruff mama taking a bite out of crime
Literally, first it'll be dancing with me
Then it'll be dinner with me
Then it'll be back to my crib
Hold up, I'm about to get ahead of myself
And I'm playing myself
The type of brother that when I'm thinking of stuff
I'm saying the stuff
My bad, back it up let's start with a dance

She gave me the impression that she was getting my message
So I'm testing
I threw it out there, let me buy you a drink'
'Cause when I buy you I think it'd be fly if we link
What'cha think?
She responded with a grin and a glance
Then my eyes tried to seduce her to the forbidden dance
The body of a Latin goddess, sexy but modest
The hottest mami chula from Cuba, a cutie with promise
The other night I seen her dancing
Duty was over
She did a split into a spin
And put her leg on his shoulder
And he was over
If that was me and I was he
We'd probably still be dancing
Mami can you feel me?
Still she said nothing
Why she be fronting?

 Ugh, Ugh, I'm comin' (echoes)...
 ...Watch ya back, I'm comin...
[Man (singing):]
 Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh (echoes)...
Will: 
 Big Will for the Y2K, ugh

Verse One:
Feel the Earth tremble, see the skies turn red
Eclipses, shooting stars, turn ya head
Volcanoes erupted, rage in the sea
Ain't the second coming of Christ
The first coming of me
They say if you downward the Nile
It would throw off the rotation of the Earth
Well, messing with me is worse
Feel the rain, button up you overcoat
Watch the illest ??? bad boy go quote for quote
Well, ya'll want the best, well, I'm right here
You looking for competition, ain't no one there
Ya'll in the stands dissin', kickin' dirt and missin'
My heavenly flow put MC's in hell's kitchen, ugh
And I'm so, I'm so hot, hot, ya'll burnin' up, HOT
I step in, it's like the wedding between Hope and Armaggedon
The Hip Hop Moses to where we headin' y'all

Chorus:
I'm comin', I'm comin,
You can't stop me, you can't stop me,
I'm comin', I'm comin',
Can't hold me back, uh uh,
I'm comin', I'm comin,
You can't stop me, you can't stop me,
I'm comin', I'm comin'...

Verse Two:
When I was born there was a rainbow formed with no sun
Roy G Bid marking the path for the chosen one
An angel, my grandma, told me before she died
Smart folks don't need to put no cursing in they rhymes
So from CD to TV to movies back to rhymin'
My lifestats makes Jordan's six rings look common
Ya'll hate, I retaliate, just by being great
Big Will the enemy of your mental state
With the same rhyme I used to burn your idol in a battle
To subdue you into saying, ""Look, I don't want to battle,""
MIB, WB mad respect
Black stealthbombarama, radar can't detect that
I'm comin' is what I screamed 
as a teen armed with discipline, faith, and a dream
After smoke clears, after life's roller coasters
See who stands putting his mic into his holster, what!

[Chorus]
Batton down the hatches and latch the doors
You want to try to match my whits with yours
Three hits, I hit you, you hit the floor
This track is the third hit, that's for sure
Beat thick reminiscin' of a bodacelli
I'm like a cheetah huntin' out on the Serengeti
I got my X-ray vision through all in my way
No Plan be	, it distracts from Plan A
Stay splitting in half, earthquake style
Evacuate your premisses, the hardcore nemesis
I never miss, my flow never flawed
Grab mics and send electric shocks through the cord
Quest for the rings my only weapon's intuition
My future position is determined by past decisions
So young George Bush, I'm thinking bout runnin'
Maybe not this time, but trust dude, ugh

[Chorus]
[Man (singing)]
Comin', comin', you can't stop me,
Comin' comin', can't hold me back, no.

Comin', comin', you can't stop me,
Comin' comin', can't hold me back.

Will Smith,"(Yeah, uh, uh, uh)
(Can't feel the rain)
(What, what, uh, we 'bout to do it like)

The little rain drops fallin' down on me
But I can't seem to feel it, feel it (can't feel the rain)
Feel it coming over me (can't feel the rain)

The little rain drops fallin' down on me
But I can't seem to feel it, feel it (can't feel the rain)
Feel it coming over me (can't feel the rain)

The rain gon' come through the window, pain will come
Black, white, rich, poor, it's the same old drum
Rainy days like the war, use wisdom as a weapon
Hold your head up, dry your clothes and keep steppin'
Let the children feel the rain, 'cause if they feel the rain
From the wetness, they stand to gain
I came into the game, it felt like the middle of June
Music was warm, artists, like flowers, they bloom
Then boom, I shook the room, many felt the thunder
My time to shine, did it like summer
I wondered if the sun would shine forever
Pops said ""rain gon' come"", to him I said ""never""

Chedder in the genes, face on screens
Got a Benz wit' the sheen, but what did it all mean
I earned money and burned money, credit cards smokin'
Platinum, grammys, famous, but still broke and
Not having cash, put me in check
Yo, the road to the riches is slippery when wet
Amongst the fall is where you truly find yourself
Ever since then, the rain I never felt
Deal wit' it

The little rain drops fallin' down on me
But I can't seem to feel it, feel it (can't feel the rain)
Feel it coming over me (can't feel the rain)

At age seventeen, the worst pain, a hurricane
Her first name still conjures the rain
Vowed to never let nobody ever get me wet
Lest we forget, love is a four season concept
Many say the rain they can't stand
Never let the weather determine the man
God has a plan, from it I never ran
Follow my heart through the storm, my umbrella in hand
I'm Noah, life's my arc
forty days and forty nights, still can't take my heart
Seen the fallen man
To dope and liquor brands
The devil'll dance to make it rain
Bringing the pain
Walk through the puddles of struggle on flooded streets
Soakin' wet, but mastered the art of peace
Through grey skies, I grew wise, on bended knees I knelt
Since then, the rain I never felt 
What's wit' it

The little rain drops fallin' down on me
But I can't seem to feel it, feel it (can't feel the rain)
Feel it coming over me (can't feel the rain)

Sometimes I sit in my room, stuff on my mind
Stress, can't rest, so I open the blinds
See kids in the streets, runnin' around
It wasn't touchin' 'em, but the rain was comin' down
I wondered how, with my mouth wide
Reminisce of the key, said I want to go outside
In the rain, to see if the same would happen to me
'Bout that time, God started rappin' to me
He said ""pain is the mother of change, the rain must flow 
So the seeds of joy might grow
Don't be afraid, find shelter in me
The road to greatness, through the valley of adversity""
I felt the light as He proceeded to drop the gem
These little children, the world we must receive like them
I just smiled, and thanked Him for the cards He dealt
And since then, the rain I never felt
What's wit' it

The little rain drops fallin' down on me
But I can't seem to feel it, feel it (can't feel the rain)
Feel it coming over me (can't feel the rain)",The Rain [Featuring Jill Scott],1999

Make em' say uuhhh
Make it hot, uuhhh
Take me away uuhhh
Flow crazy, uuhhh
Make em' say uuhhh, uuhhh, uuhhh

Been to the mountain top, down to the valley
Philadelph to Cali, y'all feel me like Harry felt Sally
Clothes exotic, flows erotic
No jewels that's for them fools who ain't got it

Rap to my own sitcom, now I just sit calm
Watching y'all respond to my July 4th bomb
Yeah, I'm a nice kid but here's some advice kid
Don't get me hyped, I'll set it off like my wife did

Playin' down a path like Sajak, Wheel of Fortune away
Price ain't right I don't play, find yourself in Jeopardy
The first clue, what is Will Smith?
Hot to death, not you

I'm like a Porsche, you a Pinto
You like a tiny figurine, I'm monumental
You're like a small get together on your neighbor's back porch
You know just a couple of y'all, I'm a million man march

Attack of the man in black like Jordan playin' on a train
Yo my game on track, mad ice for my wife
No care for what it costed
Had to ease up though, her wrist got frost bit

My style, flava, delivery, my diction
Gettin' medieval like dude in Pulp Fiction
You want some? Bring it. Come one, come all, come in
Watch me take they heart away like penny

I could take 12 rappers and put 'em in line
Then 12 emcees that think they can rhyme
Then 12 more brothers that still ain't signed
Then don't do nothing, just watch 'em decline

Gangsta hardcore, menace to society
Raps all the same my pen spits variety
Eclecticism is a virtue it may not be a word
But it's definitely a virtue

Rappers approachin' me all across America
Believe me you don't wanna battle like Erykah
I was in the game before publishin' was an issue
Yeah platinum now but next year I'm gonna miss you

Mad rappers like bad actors should have no parts
Wanna be mad? Check the charts, any of them
Oh, you don't see my name, you don't see my spot?
Here's a hint, look closer to the top

Can you feel it baby? uuhhh
Take me away, uuhhh
Flow crazy, uuhhh
Make em' say uuhhh
Make it hot, uuhhh
Take me away, uuhhh
Flow crazy, uuhhh
Make em' say uuhhh, uuhhh, uuhhh

Love and loyalty
Yo yo, the flow spray, Vito say
I'm tryin' to live and if I catch you out of bounds
It's cheap shots to the ribs
Love and loyalty dawg, do it how Pac and Big did it
It's the Wild Wild East and me keepin' me jig with it

Play no games, thirst to heat the rhyme
Motivation 'cause procrastination is the thief of time
Holding a torch, I was programmed to scorch
Can't run with the big dawgs? Then stay on the porch

These cats is craftmatic, hand on the steering wheel
Rocks from the road dodging oncoming traffic
Manhandle rappers, dismantle rappers
Yeah lukewarm slash sweet-scented candle rappers

Any teams posing a threat we defeat those
The wealthy man is the man that knows how to keep dough
As long as y'all play foul I'ma keep hittin' free throws
Crush Spanish mamis calling me Kelito

Remember Lego blocks? All about the paper now
I use writer's blocks to build skyscraper style
Catch rappers using the same flows every day 'cause they lame
True players gotta change their uniform after the game

Y'all seen the flow like y'all never seen before
Don't stop for the door why do you think green mean gold?
Baby learn life's lessons scratch regression
Kel Spence the truth, the answer to all questions
Come on

Damn Kel, you kind of good

Off in the zone unorthodox with the world on blocks 

It's unexplainable how I got these bitch niggas locked 

Keep my eyes on my safe and keep this murderous flavour 

Since I picked up a strap I've had this murderous behaviour 

Spread the whole clip around and get the fuck outta Dodge 

I got a ride full of straps in my homies backyard 

It's too cold to proceed without a block to start 

Watch a gat blows him apart as the bullets depart 

Now who the fuck am I? Is the question you ask 

Can't be touched or fucked with is all you need to know 

It's 1998 plus you bitches got to go 

And y'all cain't fuck with me and tell em why 

My adrenaline rush on jump 

Plus you got my arm beneath grabbing with the double barrel pump 

(Chorus x 2) 

(Belo) 

I hear some niggas talking loud like we been stealing this shit 

Just say you hate me cock the bullshit don't you grip on my dick 

It's Belo Zero mother fuckers same sick ass nut 

Drink a brew and smoke some weed and blow your bitch ass up 

I put in work so recognise I carry my shit on my chest 

More respect and I neglect to come up back with the vest 

I never seen a thousand soldiers hit the dirt on your roll 

Fuck your chief and all the soldiers I'm a king on my own 

I'm coming with force down with Big Chief nigga Rapalot style 

Grip sixteens and triple beams will leave that ass on the pile 

Walk on down and see the light 'cause I'm not faking the shit 

I told you once that I'm a soldier I'm just taking your shit 

Now who am I a born killer nigga fuck what you heard 

I'm too delirious and serious I ain't like a nerd 

Fuck around and call the coroner dig your whole ass up 

Separate your head from the spam and leave your bitch ass stuck 

Nigga... 

(Chorus x 2) 

(N.A.R.D) 

Retaliation is a must 

I see niggas from behind so I bust 

My Desert Eagles gon to catch you when they duck 

Now what the purpose when they still gon get struck 

And leave they brains fucked up 

I don't know why they put they eyes on me 

'cause I'm a black material killer trying to keep it low key 

Now what it was they probably didn't know it was me 

But that goes to show em that fancy bitches focus just be 

They want to look up on my Rolex while I spot on my heat 

They see my Lexus car shining when I been on the streets 

With no ticket on it but still they try to find out what's in it 

It's a black nigga with a black chrome on the seat 

In the dark zone it's on 

And hell yeah I used to push packs 

Taking niggas straps and pimping bitches in 'lacs 

Matter of fact this shit I rap about I did before 

See it ain't no studio mother fucker just stepping through these doors 

(Chorus x 2) 

We can't be fucked with we can't be touched

Saw your picture your so surly boy you keep my laughing
We've got a photo shoot can't concentrate my mind is roamin'

Seeds of my wildest dreams fertilized in your eyes
Your compassionate and your passion is how you ration it
That makes me swear you was trained how to take me there
Rarely I seen faith be fared
We got a stroke of grace
Remember you was counting me out?
It's crazy we had times of doubt right?
And since the dawn of time written history
Better men better poet than me
Have tried to set verse to the love they knew
Dead to words judge what I do when I give you

Come back me dancing like wow like this thing is a game
One little move on her and she bust into flames (whoosh)
The whole club running trying to ruin my night
I told her roll around little she'll be alright
Then everybody mad at me all up in my face
Somebody should've told that girl to stay in her place
You feel a little heat baby girl I'm behind ya
And hopefully your burnt Gucci dress will remind ya
Of how serious I am maybe it's crazy why yall

Mos def full funk when ya looking at the front looking like a jet magazine beauty of the month
Shades low laying liggy low on the cut
Told myself you're the one to shake it up with

Get the van from Rock and then
Call up Ishcabibble's, Jim's and Pat's
And tell 'em we need cheese steaks for like, 300 cats
And yo, make sure it's hot or else I'm sending 'em back
And get my mic right
If I get hyped, I might rap
Then take the speakers find a good spot
Subs on the bottom, tweeters up top
Yo, you know where little John lives on the corner
The extension cord'll run perfectly to his crib
And then tell Officer Mike to barricade the block
Regardless what car you got, leave it up top

Stand back, everybody come to see the man rap

It's ten o'clock now Jeff is trying to hype me
Will the Fresh Prince come up to the mic please?
Hear the crowd cheer, brought a little smile out
Mic check, one, two- I'm 'bout to wild out
I know he's old, but
Maybe it's a slight chance
I could get my brother hype
Make him break dance- ha, maybe not
Lemme get the crowd jumping
Let me him 'em with the brand new funk or something
I'm like Rob Base- I want to rock right now

Point Blank
My name to be etched in stone
My destiny preordained
Trying to live righteous
Fighting for life, this my life
That's why I liked on my vices
Tightening the vices of truth on the roofless
This is rhyme and the crime and their minds is just useless
The path of the poison, the genesis of the genisi
You and your boys trying to decide, what to write
But your hand is a sword and the blade has been forged
Young minds getting gorged Stakes have been altered
By lick or by weed and then hate gets exalted
As art falls to greed, Choices is Made that's the voices is laid
On the track, contract, the soldier wage, did you see his new benz,
But your like a syringe now proud of your binge.

Got a lot of new friends, got a lot of new ends
Bought a house up in the hills fronting shouts to the pen
Giving false accounts of your account's amounts
Amounts the fans treason stands to reason since your inception
Laced with deception and bred with false affection it must perish
From the Terrace I see the fire burning the streets but I won't shield my eyes to the heat
Born to reign

Eyes never hiding your heart angelic looking
Faking disinterest but I can tell you're looking
Face to face her eye to eye stance with me
Didn't even say nothing I felt you want to dance with me
You push me back a little when I kissed your hand
Said you was attracted to me truly but you had a man
I put my finger up don't say nothing
He ain't here is he? We can play or something
He at the crib oh, I see you live with him
What you gone get married to him and have some kids with him
Us could be just a weekend thing
Just a weekday thing, just a thing ma
Look we can have everything else
But for tonight let me have you for myself

I just want one night to you all over
Baby girl
This our secret rondevue
Look in my eyes I'm telling you
All I'm tryin' to do is change your view
For a moment or two
Baby girl
I don't want to break up your happy home
Baby I don't want to be alone
So let me jump in the zone
Can't you feel the Jones

[Chorus]

[Verse 3 (Will Smith)]
Thinking of living your life as a hundred yards long
Give me a quarter-inch that's all I'm asking
Do the math I'm the sun you the earth
Its you-N-I-verse and its the worst
Cause I thirst to tape connect her
I know you got a life momma
Trust me I don't want to bring your life drama
I can barely hear my think slide with me
Dip out the side door take a ride with me
Let me hear about (Uh)
What you think about (Uh)
What you need to do (Uh)
The things you dream about
Your Body with me but I know where your heart's at
Let it ring ma call him back
Wishing I could stop the clock to make it last with you
Am I goin' be at home alone with a glass slipper
Is it a sin to pretend with another fella
Midnight the story ends like Cinderella

On Christmas, mom and wife douse em with ice
AOL, search will smith thousands of sites
And at the club, hands clapping toes tapping
Sucker I'm the greatest thing ever happen to rapping (in Ali voice)
Best shape of my life destined to show ya
No scrapes or fender benders lead the game total

Will Smith,"At 17 years old I started runnin' the streets
Man, I had some fun in the streets
11, 12, sometimes 1 in the streets
By 18, I started seeing the sun in the streets

My mom started trippin' on me
Like Will, you gotta choose your friends carefully
Like, I trust you but please call me
And when you have kids of your own you'll see
I'ma be here when all your friends won't

But I was busy hollerin' parents just don't understand
Now here I am with a family runnin' the lines she ran on me
We ain't always see eye to eye but Mom, on your principles
Now I rely, you got me tastin' my toes

I didn't know
Momma told me don't go down that road
But I gotta go where I gotta go
So take your fool telling me I told you so

I used to roll hard with this dude named Chuck
Rollin' in my car with this dude named Chuck
My Mommy really liked this dude named Chuck
She thought he was really and polite, Chuck

And me used to roll out faithfully, inevitably
You see Chuck, you gon' see me
Like we on TV, the bosom is the buddy
Share food, clothes, and money, and hunnies

Flock like we was players from the NBA
Still hurts to recall the day I heard him say
To this girl named Mya
I was diggin', he told her I was a liar

Told her I be cheatin' on women
Breakin' hearts and grinnin'
He told her her life would be better with him in it
That's the friend I chose

I didn't know
Momma told me don't go down that road
But I gotta go where I gotta go
So take your fool telling me I told you so

Momma used to say, ""Take your time young man
I ain't always gonna be there , holding your hand
But, you'll always know exactly where I am
And when I'm not there in my place the Lord will stand

Will study the world, only the wise succeed
And when you're eyes tell lies your heart should lead
You're gonna do dirt we all gon' sin
But when you realize it, apologize and never do it again

Mom told me don't rush to get old
If you got youth, truth clutched in your hold
It's like possibilities too much to behold
An emotional shield from life's blustery cold

Mom, all this stuff was hard you said was hard
Childish disregard 'cause my head was hard
Now, no question opposed, ugh

I didn't know
Momma told me don't go down that road
But I gotta go where I gotta go
So take your fool telling me I told you so

Saw your picture you're so silly boy you keep me laughing
I've got a photo shoot can't concentrate my mind is roamin'
Because it's 4 o'clock and at 5:15 you are comin' home and

It's like Beethoven composed your vocal tones
Wrote band inspired hand sculpted you the desire of man, uh
Michel Angelo grieves inside you
Seeds of my wildest dreams fertilized in your eyes
Your compationate and your passion is how you ration it

That makes me swear you was trained how to take me there
Rarely I seen faith be fared
We got a stroke of grace remember you was countin' me out?
It's crazy we had times of doubt right?
And since the dawn of time written history
Better men, better poet than me
Have tried to set verse to the love they knew
Dead to words judge what I do when I give you

All my love

A 1,000 kisses from you is never to much
Never too much, never too much, never too much

Will Smith,"Yo, Big Will in the place to be, mic check...mic check..
Would you love me in the shack in a shanty town
Would you love me if my pants was hand me downs, huh?
Yo, yo,
Often times I hear a phrase when I'm out & about
8 to 80, all walks of life be shouting it out
Usually, when its time for a encore I hear it
Or when I did something hot, evoking the spirit
It's weird, its like a double edge sword when ya'll applaud
It's kinda wild, a peace sign, a smile
How do I respond to the phrase, ""I love you Will!""?
Kinda heavy when I hear it, I'd be like damn for real?
In a way it makes me want to stay strong and moral
But history say I could be gone tomorrow
& though my future looks floral
I feel like I'm hoping for much pain
When people stop shouting my name
& doubting my game & liking others better than me
Writing letters to him instead of to me
A veteran 'be	', I know the game, but do me this here,
In your heart be clear before you bless my ear
Come on..

[CHORUS]

Could you love me if I lived in a shanty town
Could you love me if my pants was hanging down
Could you love me if my wrist ain't bling
If I wasn't on TV & I ain't sing, huh?
Could you love me if my whip wasn't chrome fitted
Would my name be easier to forget it, huh?
Could you love me if wrist ain't bling
If I wasn't on TV & I ain't sing, huh?
I pray before I sit with a pen & a pad
A birth of a thought occurs & it calls me Dad
To the universe an idea released from me
Just a CD, nah man, a piece of me
What you can't see is when you be dancing 'be	'
Is I asked you a question, that's how you answer me
So when you don't dance, it be like I'm choking from cancer
Like I wrote rancid rhymes, I can't survive
Sure, I rationalize like, oh, I see..
But if you don't like my cut, its like you don't like me
Some stuff works, some works not so well
Its like you work so hard, still get hurt like hell
Yo, it could tear you apart
But don't let your wins go to your heard
Your losses go to your heart
& if we ever get the pleasure to meet
Be clever with it, measure what you yell in the street
Come on...

Or a time conflict with my sci-fi hits
I'm contemplating each statement's wit
& I'm concentrating on making hits

how he practiced rap & now he's devout
every album track packs what he's about
In the past he passed with passion, old fashioned""
Boldly mashing, totally crashing
Words up in a disorderly fashion
But back to the lab & guess what happened, KABOOM!
(ooh wee!) ""Dude's resilient!"" Fresh Prince was hot,
the movies killed him, wait, hold up, stop! You can rebuild him
lock him back in hip hop while Dude's not filming
shock by the film & the TV money, went from scenes with Uncle Phil
to scenes with Sonny, so hard to break free from a guaranteed 20
but its done, so come see the MC, honey!

Damn it, this cat's on a rap song, yeah, it ain't no braids
Or plats on, ain't on stage wit no gats on
You know I'm afraid, gettin' my act on
It might have stunted my growth, but I wanted them both

An' I hope that it would be less tougher
You do two things an' then they both gonna suffer

Thought she would be his wife OH Loretta
Never ever meant him no danger, her love for his sustained her
Thought that he would change her life
Miss Loretta, a young girl, I never really met her,
A fun girl, a real go-getter, I heard a gold Jetta
A full with books & herb or so I'm told, hooked on my every word
Oh so bold, a love letter cleverly worded in a jacket pocket
Wrapped inside a platinum locket
In the shape of a heart with pictures of me
Had it inscribed, ""no us, no him then no me
She fell in love with the Prince of Bel-Air
Fantasy was to see me & to be with me there
So she wrote a love letter to me & then she signed it Loretta
Said, ""I gotta go get him, Will is my Soulmate""
We gotta be together how could we not be together
But wait if I send the letter I mean how will I be sure if they give it to him
What if they don't give it to him, that would ruin everything
I gotta take it to him myself

her backpack, her cellphone & a love letter

Leave me alone Ma! I won't leave my destiny unfulfilled

14 months outside every event that I'd be at, she'd still keep missing me
& now she's getting high with more frequency now

That's what's wrong wit the rap game right now
Why should I try to flow the way ya'll flow
Or do a show like ya'll show
Naw that ain't where my head at now
Ya'll in the hip hop lost and found
Man, that's wrong with the rap game right now
It's like a circus wit a bunch of clowns
Wit a bunch of clicks
I'll probably rap circles around

Let's talk about rhyme capability
Let's talk about hip hop versatility
Let's talk about taking the game beyond
Now how the hell we gon have a battle of wits
Trick you ain't armed
Let's talk about love for the game
I mean real love
Back before there was fame
I'm real wit it
I ain't claiming to reign
But when ya'll talk about rap
Ya'll gon start saying my name
For real though I ain't playin
Plenty of ya'll love a brotha just scared to say it
Yo the first ever rap grammy
Let's talk about the only reason yo ass went to Miami
(Yup) truck wit rims (check) throw back jersey (check)
champagne bottles (check) lot's of models (check)
Damn that's the list for 90 percent of ya'll videos and songs

Wit no care for the cost of what you sayin to kids
FOUND
Is when ya lyrics are a test of time
And your mom hear that your spirit is blessed divine
LOST
Is when you rhyme til your throat gets sore
But you don't even believe what you say no more
FOUND
Is when you bleed heart into the mic
And the pain you sustain it can change a life
LOST
Is when you hide behind the freedom of speech
While sure you're free to do it
But what it mean to do it
Did you mean to do it
Did you need to do it
Did you take time to think about the seeds you ruined
FOUND Is ESCO, dead PREZ and them
FOUND Is Lauren Hill
FOUND Is Rakim
FOUND Can be you
If you felt the message and ask yourself this questioin

Oh! I'm the Party Starter,
You might have a good time but we party harder
So, tell the DJ to play my song
& we could dance all night to the early mornin'
Dance, an aphrodisiac
Women gyrating, simulating sensual acts
To stimulating musical tracks
I thought I was just gon' come out tonight & get a brew & relax
But no! Uh uh, when you're the party starter
It's like you're on call, you're what the doctor ordered
It's like you gotta block the border to the door
& shock em when it's boring....

Ughh, it's the groovicide bomber, mic in my vest
Tight, strapped to my chest
Like, I'ma run up in the party hollerin'
& be like ""Ohhh!"", fulfillin' my callin'
Big! (Big), Will! (Will), that's my name, whoop!
Writin' rhymes, that's my game, whoop!

He was raised in the days when the roof was raised
Every rap occasion, new & amazing
The back of the stage amazed and gazin'
Prayin for the day they would one day praise him
Studied the ways of the game & made it
Came through the maze & the haze & played it perfect
Days any person hated & cursed him, he was unfazed
He waited, it was worth it, he never retaliated
He saved it, slavin', on the road blazin'
Days when he was low, nothin' could raise him
He came to the show & somethin' uncaged in him
Like the pope, but its party crusade, I'm like braids that's never gon'
fade (ya heard)
I'm like, 23's on an Escalade, throw me into the rave
like you threw a grenade - BOOM!!


I call for the days of the unadulterated
When the artistry was cultivated
You know, back when rap was smart and multilayered
We could rap without A&Rs& ultimatums (damn)
Now today I could say I long for the days when the party was all about
partyin'
I was a mini-party starter then
My mind bends when I call my pen
The big question should I run the mind a vittle
Food for thought or dumb the rhyme a little
But Will ""if you come to high that'll alienate folks & they won't buy
it""(yo),
Look, people getting trapped in the track
& they be clappin', even when the rappin' is wack
Yo, what happened, when did we get happy wit that?

See your itinerary is all off
You need to be hauled off
She start flippin', she ain't trippin' it's your loss.
This is a simple case of an anti-brake pumper
You don't have to talk to women bumper to bumper

Oh you want to hear a story? What kind of story you want to hear baby?
Willow
A scary story
[VERSE 1]
Oh, ok
Once upon a time there was a kid who wanted nothin' more than to rhyme
Almost like he was born in the rhyme
He thought of his rhymes almost all of the time
And he fought with his mom
His school getting caught with his rhyme book
And he knew he shouldn't of took it there in the first place
At least he shouldn't of been sittin lookin there in her face with it
Teacher told him get it out of her class
Wicked witch, trick told him that's probably why you won't pass
Now if you shy you won't last but you're new
So underneath his breath before he left he said I'm a be richer then you
What you say? She said.
What you mean? He said.
Boy don't you play, she said.
What you mean? He said. Damnit.
Ten minutes later standin up in the principles office
Getting handed the phone clammed up cause his father was talking
And he was pissed he wasn't listening to his son.
You testing me? You messin up again
You done boy.

First thing he did was find somebody to give him some money.
He wasn't stupid but wasn't using his senses honey.
The guy's he meant was a little shady, a little funny.
But they gave him the money so they played the record company.
It sounds silly but when he grew up in Philly rhymin wasn't what it is today
Deals wasn't a dime a dozen
Today every sister, uncle, or mom or cousin gotta record deal
But for real it wasn't like that then.
As you could imagine when he started risin to fame and fortune he was
havin Started antagonizing the guy's he was with
At the same time he started realizing
The deal he got from them guys in his eyes didn't fly with size of his hits
He called a meeting to find a solution.
He said I'm gettin beat out of my loot
And I'm not recording no more until we find a solution
The dude's said we found a solution its this .44
He ran for the door a little shaken
But the next day he found a lawyer, told him the situation
He said I'm breakin this contract for ya
He said how much the lawyer said I'm a charge you a quarter cause I like you 
Just do me a favor
get your life in order

Hey switch, turn it over and hit it
Turn around, now switch
Turn it over and hit it

Hey, vibe to vibe a second, it's a club girl why you arrived naked
Hear that, how the veteran glide the record
But don't download, go out and buy the record
Hey, something sexy bout her
Girl on the floor, all her friends around her
I mean real clean, ain't gotta touch or nothing
It ain't like I like a chick on chick or something
I'm just a sucker for a hot track
Gimme a drink and a chick to tell 'Stop that'
Dance is a hop and a clap, flip it round
Now bring it on back, break it down
Now switch

Hey switch, turn it over and hit it

I gotta question, I need to ask somebody
Why is it that when y'all see me at the party
Y'all be looking like, ""Ooh, he a movie star
He ain't supposed to be out on the floor with everybody""
But oh wait, whoa, y'all forgetting
When I was, amateur spitting before the scripts were written
First one in, last one out the club
Bursting in, passing out in the club
Back at it, this cat is the wit and the charm
Taking you higher, like a syringe hittin' ya arm
Bringing the fire, making your Benz ring the alarm
Let me see you clap, spin baby, come on

Turn around, now switch

Oh, you just gonna stand there, huh
What you too cute to dance, or you scared
It ain't really that hard to do and
I ain't trying to be in love with you and
All I wanted was a moment or two to
See if you could do that switch-a-roo and
Shut your mouth fool, get your crew and
The thick body and the rear one too and
I'll be right hear waiting on you to
See if y'all can do that switch-a-roo

September 11th I woke up about 7 AM
West coast time, french toast and my turkey bacon
Takin' my time awakin, turnin' my TV on
To my surprise, saw what everybody in the world saw
Me and my children, images were chillin'
My son said - daddy were there people in that building?
A cold sweat, frozen with a lump in my chest
I heard his question, couldn't bring my lips to say yes to him
That night at my son's side, he cried
And prayed for the ones who died in the World Trade
His palms to God, seeds of qualms with God
He just, kept on pressin' me, wanna know why
Then one week later our bombs were dropped
We seein' them, on CNN, they just won't stop
The infrared, images of brutal attack
He said ""Daddy now we killin' 'em back,"" right right

Souls are captured (souls are captured)
Dreams are stolen (dreams are stolen)
Hearts are broken (hearts are broken)

Love exalted! (Love exalted!)
Hope elated! (hope elated!)
Negativity destroyed and..

[Will Smith]
Honest to God, why is the bomb always gettin' the last word
and why, did her uncles have to molest her
and why, did all them cops have to be shootin' to kill?
And why, did all them priests have to act so ill?
Tell me why did James Byrd Jr. have to be touched?
Tell my why did Malcolm and Martin depart from us
Tell me why did the sniper make that little boy shoot
And why, is human life always denied for loot?
Tell me WHY did MANDELA have to live in a cage
Why did my brother Sterling have to die at that age
Tell me why did Reginald Denny deserve his fate
And why the fuck can't love, seem to defeat hate?
Tell me why is it so hard for all the children to eat?
Why did 'Pac and Biggie Smalls have to fall in the street?
Tell me why did Jam Master Jay have to go that way?
Please, what am I supposed to say my kids when they say

Can't explain it baby life is just really crazy
I mean if it's world wars or the life of a little baby
We got more stores than they got rice under buddha lazy
You live four scores and still it be drivin' you crazy
But for me I try to see the button side
Sometimes it be like the goodness be tryin' to hide
or tryin' to flee, but it can't, it's deep inside

Will Smith,"From a distance, you can witness the glow from my entourage
Gravitate towards the ambiance
See me & my men on CNN, then the birth of the inevitable hate begin
Cause hate is the chld to greatness
The glue between Neo & the Smiths in the matrix, yin to the yang
It just must be, ask anybody with a Grammy or an MVP

I said stop, get out, I don't need this hate around me
All your negativity might drown me I just try to go hard, doing my job
Stop, get out - the whole world loves me cause I do what I do
& I don't like the energy coming from you Trying to play me soft, wave em off

(I just wave em off, yeah) I ain't concerned with your hatin' that don't slow down my paper makin
(wave em off, yeah) While the whole world recognize, you looking at me with your crooked eyes
(wave em off yeah) Love me, I paved the way, boys we can't behave this way come on
(wave em off, yeah)While the whole world recognize, you looking at me with your crooked eyes
Coming of age I invaded nations, on stage, I seen Haitian & Asian faces
No vacations just more locations, I go places, so chasing my vocation
So demonstrating the way to be patient with life's test, through my IRS situations
My guess is my dedication don't phase ya, a public sensation, in private you hatin'
Why? That's so last year, that's so not sexy, but I shall not let the hate stress me
I got bigger fish to fry & I could stand on my wallet, probably kiss the sky
When I close my eyes, I wish that I could change how you get pissed when I do things you can't deny
Truth is, Great do need Hate to survive, so I...

Block 'em out, ignore 'em (wave em off)
Don't pay these jokers no mind (wave em off)
They just all mad cause they in the coat section of the hate train & they can't get off

Will Smith,"[Chorus]
The little rain drops fallin' down on me
But I can't seem to feel it, feel it
Feel it coming over me

The rain gon' come through the window; pain will come
Black, white, rich, poor; it's the same old drum
Rainy days like the war, use wisdom as a weapon
Hold your head up, dry your clothes and keep steppin'
Let the children feel the rain, 'cause if they feel the rain
From the wetness, they stand to gain
I came into the game; it felt like the middle of June
Music was warm; artists, like flowers: they bloom
Then boom; I shook the room, many felt the thunder
My time to shine; did it like summer
I wondered if the sun would shine forever
Pops said, 'rain gon' come.' to him I said, 'never'
Cheddar in the genes, face on screens
Got a benz wit' the sheen, but what did it all mean?
I earned money and burned money, credit cards smokin'
Platinum, Grammys, famous, but still broke and
Not having cash put me in check
Yo, the road to the riches is slippery when wet
Amongst the fall is where you truly find yourself
Ever since then, the rain I never felt
Deal wit' it

[Chorus]

At age seventeen, the worst pain: a hurricane
Her first name still conjures the rain
Vowed to never let nobody ever get me wet
Lest we forget, love is a four season concept
Many say the rain they can't stand
Never let the weather determine the man
God has a plan; from it I never ran
Follow my heart through the storm, my umbrella in hand
I'm Noah, life's my arc
Forty days and forty nights; still can't take my heart
Seen the fallen man
To dope and liquor brands
The devil'll dance to make it rain
Bringing the pain
Walk through the puddles of struggle on flooded streets
Soakin' wet, but mastered the art of peace
Through grey skies I grew wise, on bended knees I knelt
Since then, the rain I never felt 
What's wit' it?

[Chorus]

Sometimes I sit in my room, stuff on my mind
Stress, can't rest, so I open the blinds
See kids in the streets, runnin' around
It wasn't touchin' 'em, but the rain was comin' down
I wondered how, with my mouth wide
Reminisce of the key, said I want to go outside
In the rain, to see if the same would happen to me
'Bout that time God started rappin' to me
He said, 'pain is the mother of change, the rain must flow 
So the seeds of joy might grow
Don't be afraid, find shelter in me
The road to greatness through the valley of adversity.'
I felt the light as He proceeded to drop the gem
These little children; the world we must receive like them
I just smiled, and thanked Him for the cards He dealt
And since then, the rain I never felt
What's wit' it?

We set the prairie on fire

How far will it go

When the feeling burns down
To one solitary color
The velocity of longing
Melting into each other
It's a song our fingers play
All at once and together
You can bet we never learned it
But we've known it forever

Oh I dreamed that we were flying
Carried up from the ashes
Black silhouettes of velvet
Against the crimson of passion
We can almost hear the echoes
From the smoldering meadow
It's the rapture of the angels
And the rage of the devil

Through the rusted wires of sleep
With our arms around midnight
We're headed for release

We go riding in the dark

'Cause time can't change the way I feel
And you will find that I'm gonna be
More than you'll ever let me be

I'm just caught in the middle you
Play my heart with a little bit of
Dangerous love and I really
Want to be free
Got me caught and I'm living in a
Low life world its your unoriginality
That's killing me
I've just got to be free

Free to disown you
'Coz I thought that I told you
You been treating me badly
And you misappreciate my love
I'm trying to breathe
But it's killing me slowly
And you started to break me
With your dangerous love

Got to
Got to be free [repeat x4]
I'm just caught in the middle you
Play my heart with a little bit of
Dangerous love and I really
Want to be free
Got me caught and I'm living in a
Low life world its your unoriginality
That's killing me
I've just got to be free

Will Young,"We've been told to live our lives
Just working on a feeling
Waiting for the sun to shine on what
We do believe in
In every man
I hear the cry of someone else
A drowning man reaching out
But no-one hears
I know a man living out his life
Without a reason 
And he says

[Chorus]
Monday's got a beautiful baby
And Wednesday's child can never win
Little Saturday will work till he's crazy
But Friday's child was born to give

Now what about all the unborn people that will suffer
At the hands of Mr. Right
Who cares about no other
I see a mother who lets her children use her up
I know a father to sacrifices his wayward son
I wonder
What you give that someone else is needing nothing
Next to nothing

[Chorus]",Friday's Child,2003
Will Young,"In time gone by, I lost my will
To try and find a clear way through
Now, it's been a while
Since I asked myself what to do
It's been a while since I played the fool
Cause they said ""raise your game, leave the shame
In this place where you will remain
Unless you save your soul"" 

[Chorus]
Now it's going my way
Forget the time that I did then
Now it's going my way
I look and everything's OK
I've got nothing much to say except
The life that I now lead
Is going my way
Going my way

It's been a while since I spent the day
The whole day wrapped up in my dreams
It took a while upstaging misery
It isn't all it seems
Now I smooth my hair, feeling tight
I'm getting into something right
Living beyond those days

[Chorus]

I don't understand how it came to
(How it came to)
I don't understand those depths of despair
(Those despairs)
I don't understand how it came to
(How it came to)
I don't understand reaching that despair
(Reaching that despair)

Will Young,"I'm here, just like I saidÃ¢?Â¦
Though it's breaking every rule I've ever made.
My racing heart is just the same;
Why make it strong to break it once again?
And I'd love to say Ã¢??I doÃ¢??;
Give everything to you.
But I could never now be trueÃ¢?Â¦

So I say,
I think I'd better leave right now
Before I fall any deeper.
I think I'd better leave right now;
Feeling weaker and weaker.
Somebody better show me how
Before I fall any deeper.
I think I'd better leave right now.

I'm here, so please explain
Why you're opening up a healing wound again.
I'm a little more careful,
Perhaps it shows.
But if I lose the highs,
At least I'm spared the lows.

Now I tremble in your arms
What could be the harm
To feel my spirit calm?

So I say,
I think I'd better leave right now
Before I fall any deeper.
I think I'd better leave right now;
Feeling weaker and weaker.
Somebody better show me how
Before I fall any deeper.
I think I'd better leave right now.

I wouldn't know how to say
How good it feels seeing you today
I see you've got your smile back
Like you say, you're right on track
But you may never know why
Once bitten, twice as shy.
If I'm proud, perhaps I should explain:
I couldn't bear to lose you again.

So I say,
I think I'd better leave right now
Before I fall any deeper.
I think I'd better leave right now;
Feeling weaker and weaker.
Somebody better show me how
Before I fall any deeper.
I think I'd better leave right now.

Yes, I will.
I think I'd better leave right now;

Has a funny way of trying to make
You a certain type
And making it hard
Yeah life
Is feet firmly on the ground
With a fear of flying
It's always too far

It only makes me stronger
When you say I can't do it
I'll work that bit harder
When you say it's not within my grip
The barriers, I'll break them down
I'll prove myself, I'll stick around
I'll get through it all somehow
Nothing's unreachable

Life
Is full of all these empty words
In perfect rhyme
When they don't make no sense
Resigned
To all of these doubts and nerves
You want first place
But you take second best

It only makes me stronger
When you say I won't succeed
I'll work that bit harder
When you say you see no strength in me
The barriers, I'll break them down
I'll prove myself, I'll stick around
I'll get through it all somehow
Nothing's unreachable

Oh, it's just a state of mind
If you set yourself up to fall
You'll never get there at all
All you've got to do is rise
It takes more to break me than a wave or two
Whatever's sent to test me
Gonna make me through

It only makes me stronger
When you say I can't do it
I'll work that bit harder
When you say it's not within my grip

We move on, we will never be replaced
And I can't even think about the next

First I must forget, by leaving
I am a different man

For the perfect frame
I know that

We traveled streets unknown
Been away too long
Now it's time to go...home
Back with our love

We should never be strangers
You should never pass me on the street
Would you please remember me as I remember you?

Looking back we were strangers in the night
We were told that we let our hearts collide
And I swear I had the time of my life
Wish I could stay, it just wouldn't be right

I know you
You turn the light off last
You let me sleep to dream
You let me wake up first
I believe in you and that will never change
But I must turn away

Try to show you what is good

Anything you could

I thought that I told you 
'Cause it means a lot to me

And every little thing that I do 
Makes it alright, alright, alright

Think it over 
Shake it up and round 
Get your life back, you've forgotten that 
That your moment is right now 
Spend your days running round, everything gets you down 
So get your life back, get your life back 
'cause your moment is right now 
Get your life back 
Give it up now 

I thought that I told you 
If there's a sound, give it a rhyme 
There's no point in letting it fall out of time 
'Cause you know, 

The life of a soldier is falling in line 
Let it go, it seems that I'm only saying things you know

I know that all you're asking for 
Is a little place in my heart 
But I don't find it easy to give 

Maybe I get a little selfish sometimes 
Why shouldn't I? 
I used to say I love you 
But would it make a difference this time?

And who am I to tell you that I would never let you down 
That no-one else could love you half as much as I do now?
And who am I to tell you I'll always catch you when you fall?

I wouldn't be myself at all, at all

I followed you there

Is under attack.

Cos it's me you can have
Can you give me an answer?

Screw (what's the deal my nigga)
Man, King Screw, dedicate this to you my nigga
We love you forever boy (straight up much love)
We ain't goin' never forget you mayn
Never forget the times we had (G love, know I'm saying)
Al-D and Z-Ro (ha) South Park Mexican

[Chorus: x2]
I'll never forget, the times when we crawled together
I'll never forget, the times when we balled together
I'll never forget, the love, hugs, smiles and tears
And the strength to help me conquer my fears

[SPM]
I'll never forget, the day we met
I was on Gravestone, trying to find a address
You told me that your wife, had just lost your baby
I never met a man, so hate free
Lately, I've been drunk as fuck
I open up a cold beer, as soon as I wake up
I live in Screwston Texas, that's my home
Banging Screw since 9-2, ask my T. Jones
When Fat Pat died, we was all alone
That boy was the coldest, on the microphone
Screw took it harder, than anyone thought
It's hard to be apart, from someone close to your heart
South Park from the start, all of a sudden
The whole nation, all bout the Screw Shop on Cullen
November 16th, I sat and cried
Cause that was the day, that Houston Texas died

[Verse 2]
I'll never forget true love see, it's gon last forever
Keep my feet on solid ground, so we could ball together
Since a young one never done one, stay true to the heart
You kept my head above water, gave me spark from the start
You put the mic in my hand, plus put your trust in me
Dodging cases being a G, you got me out of the streets
Gave me the capital of Texas, so I could throw away the pyreeces
Put a queen on my shoulder, when nights were cold as misses
Hustling smiles appear the tears, the tears from younger years
Until they find us riders, make sure you standing here
S.U.C. for L-I-F-E, Screw blew one with the streets
Slowed down originator, keeping the trunk on beat
My faith in G-O-D, putting the world up under my feet
Making imitators duketators, bow down and can't compete
From a G to a G, this here's for you to me
Staying down putting it down, screaming Screw for eternity

[Chorus: x2]

[Verse 3]
Whoever knew he would create a new sound, never been heard
Transform a simple name, into a household word
He gained fame but never changed, never switched gears
When you met him it was like, you been knowing him twenty years
Was never fake, blessed to make the rap scene elevate
Genius, watch that boy slow it down and still accelerate
God gave him a gift, and my partna knew how to use it
But the love I got for Screw, ain't got nothing to do with music
Cause when he left, the physical was consumed
But his spirit manifesting, everybody in this room
A real partna forever, I know I can never be him
But if I make him my example, when you see me then you'll see him
S for slowing it down, see cold creating
are stands for realer than real, and never hating
E forever lasting, effect never corrupt
W for the world, cause that's what he screwed up

[Verse 4]
Man I'll never forget, the difference time can make
Man I'll never forget, coming down in the 8
Man I'll never forget, we drunk the pint straight
We been free styling, since them old grey tapes
And then came the day, that we was making them G's
Had them niggas lined up, like we was slanging them ki's
But we ain't slanging D, we just moving C.D.'s
People coming to the shop, way from over the seas
But still we some G's, or should I say that we back
Coming down in a Impala, with the candy wet
Coming down MLK, with the music that bump
We was swinging and banging, steady popping the trunk
Say what's up to that Gator, Mafio and that Pat
I know why y'all looking down from heaven, watching over our back
When they mention Screwed Up Click, they goin' say that we done it
Man them boys done blew up, like the flight 800

DJ Screw player, I'll never forget
Represent S.U.C., forever my set
I'll never regret, the times we got blowed
On the road doing shows, all across the globe
It's your boy Willean, and I'm holding it down
Legendary status Screw, steady slowing it down
For H-Town for sure, we done lost a soldier
We goin' finish what you live, and I'ma put that on the Clover
It ain't over, pour and sipping the plain soda
Switching lanes over, in my black Range Rover
The Chemist that's right, I done shed some tears
All the car shows we wrecked, and bled for years
You one of my peers, DJ Screw you kept it real
You one of a kind, so you one out a mill
I'ma stay representing, South-side for live
And if S.U.C. get a deal, it's goin' be a hundred mill

[Al-D]
If nobody else, could feel my pain
It was you in my corner, through the heat and the rain
Can't call one time, you didn't make me smile
Took a fall in the Penn, boy you fed my child
Kept my name on fire, like I never left
Kept your eyes on my family, and never slept
Snatched my ass out the streets, and put a mic in my hand
Put my strap on the shelf tray, my fiends for fans
I was hard head misled, seeking for bread
Without the music in my life, I know I would of been dead
But the Lord sent you to me, like a guardian angel
When my feet was caught up in a tangle
So please smile for me, cause Screw you got me throwed in this game
I salute you with my fist, your name was never in vein
See the plack on the wall, all our dreams came true
And I'm still giving thanks to you

Reprovide you with the ride, free fallin
To make your heart beat, skip, hypnotize you and
APL take you on a trip where your mind's at ease
Forget ballin 'cause I won't quit, and Will won't quit
And Tab won't quit so you can enjoy it

Can I get a moment of silence Will bang the instrumental

will.i.am,"Baby, baby, when you're looking deep in my eyes
I know you're seeing past my make-up
Into the little girl that used to hide out and cry
When her parents fought
Tryin' to be strong
You can see the hurt in me
The cover-ups so secretly
And all that I aspire to be
You see, you see
You know who I really am
No entourage or caravan
And do you even give a damn
About all that, tell me?

Would you love me if I didn't work out
Or I didn't change my natural hair?
And I could be the one you want to grow older with, baby
I'll give you all that I got

So, I don't mean to scare you now or push you away
Cause I'm not tryin' to rush anything
But when I look into your eyes
I'm not scared as you say I see little you
I'm in the picture too
Like a happy family tree
We're together constantly
This could be eventually
We'll see, we'll see
But all that I have got to know
Is with me, baby, will you grow?
Sun and rain and heavy snow
Oh, tell me so now, baby

Would you love me if I didn't work out
Or I didn't change my natural hair?
And I could be the one you want to grow older with, baby
I'll give you all that I got

It's as simple as one and two
I'm in love with you
And three and four
You're all I adore
To the seven and eight
See, I've been making mistakes
Cause when you're on my mind
I just can't think straight
Back to the five and six
I'm all in you mix, and I'm all into you
Without the lipstick
Without the L'Oreal
You remain the same angel that I fell for you
For real, for real

Would you love me if I didn't work out
Or I didn't change my natural hair?
And I could be the one you want to grow older with, baby
I'll give you all that I got

Would you love me if I didn't work out
Or I didn't change my natural hair?
And I could be the one you want to grow older with, baby
I'll give you all that I got

Would you love me if I didn't work out

And I could be the one you want to grow older with, baby

It's the Will.i.am, I'm killin' them
Got flows that float just like helium
These hoes know I'm drillin' 'em
So when feminine's thrown I'm throwin' them

The billin' 'em till I'm rollin' in millions
Gotta flip billions into trillions
Businessly, I'm brilliant
Turn pennies into twenties like the chameleons

But never put a chinchilla on a chick
Karma-style [unverified] too legit to quit
Hip-hop on and on and on and break mics constant
Till the break of dawn and

If you want to compete, come compete
Bring and mpc-16, make a big beat
We could take it back to the b-street
We could break, we could rap, do the graffiti, yo

And you don't stop and you don't quit

Hey, 2na fish back to business
I hit the track like a sheer act of vengeance
Masked avengers get smacked and injured
Strapped'll get cho' back with some black suspenders

Autographs of the Jurassic crew
Flippin' flashes so fast like a fashion shoot
Classics, spittin' acid the fastest route
Bass'll hit yo face quicker than a passion fruit

Big cheese inflict sick disease
Make hits that'll make thick chicks strip tease
Clicks freeze when the trigger click squeeze
Makin' people in the disco duck like Riq Jeeves

But I ain't going to war wit' ch'all
And got no alcoholic beverages to pour for y'all
I'm gonna let these cats get there garbage off

The bigger the cap, the bigger the peelin' 
Come through, something ill, missin' the ceilin' 
What influenced my raps? Stick ups and killings 
Kidnappings, project buildings, drug dealings 
Criticize that, why is that? 
'cause Nas rap is compared to legitimized crap 
'cause we love to talk on ass we gettin' 
Most intellectuals will only half listen 
So you can't blame jazz musicians 
Or David Stern with his NBA fashion issues 
Oh I they like me--in my white tee 
You can't ice me, we here for life be	 
On my second marriage, hip hop's my first wifey 
And for that we not takin' it lightly

will.i.am,"Yeah, special dedication
I'm sending this one out to you
And you and you and you
I said to you and you and you

She cold blooded, I love how we meltin' the ice
She like the sunshine of my life
'Coz all I see is a hot thing and you're my hot thing
And you're my hot thing and you're my hot thing

Word, you keep my dark sky lit up at night
So bright that you blindin' my sight
'cause all I see is a hot thing and you're my hot thing
And you're my hot thing and you're my hot thing

Word, somebody like a flick, it got surprisin' twists
I write the script, the main character, your thighs and hips
Award for best supportin' role go to your eyes and lips
The way you move your body got 'em stiff like a hieroglyph

I watched you dance across the floor to the title track
You 'bout to get me 'Off The Wall' like you Michael Jack'
I make a scribe in your beauty, my sacred duty
I will write a song, write a book, write a play, make a movie

Hey, hey, hey, hey, special dedication

Good love, you a sexy thing

Love that you like it
Love that you like it, love that you like it

Good love, you a sexy thing
And all I'm sayin' is you got something I like
Love that you like it
Love that you like it, love that you like it

Yo, I love your country ass, I love your city sass
I love how your normal ways, you catch so pretty fast
These dudes are pretty crass, harass you in your past
I love how you snap back and get the last laugh

I love the way your crib smell like Votivo candle incense
The white voice you use on the phone when you handle business
I love it when you freaky, I love when you a lady
Rockin' door knockers from the late 80s, raisin' babies

I love her, God bless you, your body somethin' special
I love to play connect the dots with your facial freckles
No need for fashion policin' because I love your style
Whatever happen to Shanice, baby, 'I Love Your Smile?

I might be fallin' in love, should I let her know?
A pimp told me if I love her, I should let her go
I sing her praises every time they play this instrumental
'Coz she instrumental to my life, to my life, to my life

Hey, hey, hey, hey, special dedication

Good love, you a sexy thing
And all I'm sayin' is you got something I like
Love that you like it
Love that you like it, love that you like it

Good love, you a sexy thing
And all I'm sayin' is you got something I like
Love that you like it
Love that you like it, love that you like it

I love how we meltin' the ice
You like the sunshine of my life
'Coz all I see is a hot thing and you're my hot thing
And you're my hot thing and you're my hot thing

Word, you keep my dark sky lit up at night
So bright that you blinding my sight
'Coz all I see is a hot thing and you're my hot thing
And you're my hot thing and you're my hot thing

Word, lemme take you by the hand
You need to tell your man, don't fight it, damn
Have you groupied out like excited fans
I promise you'll be climbin' walls like Spider-Man
Knees bucklin', you'll hit the floor when you try to stand up

So you drop it like it's hot, oh so heavy
You and me, we can leave now, we can go steady
How about we be jetty because I'm so ready
To bounce like a '64 Chevy, word

Hey, hey, hey, hey, special dedication

She loves me never money or pennies
Look if you want brother you ain't getting any
That's mine yep yep that's right sonny
Get you one cause that's my honey

Get you one cause I got that one [Repeats x4]

It's the way she wear her clothes
The beauty of a low
The definition of a star

Get you one cause I got that one [Repeats x4]",Picture Perfect,2007

(I am happy, I Have a Dream) I got a Dream 
(That One Day ) We gonna work it out out out 
(That One Day ) We gonna work it out out out 
(That One Day ) We gonna work it out 
(I Have a Dream) I got a Dream

My Dream Is To Be Free 
My Dream Is To Be 
My Dream Is To Be 
My Dream Is To Be Free 

In search of brighter days, I ride through the maze of the madness, 
Struggle is my address, where pain and crack lives, 
Gunshots comin' from sounds of Blackness, 
Given this game with no time to practice, 
Born on the Black list, told I'm below average, 
A life with no cabbage, 
That's no money if you from where I'm from, 
Funny, I just want some of your sun, 
Dark clouds seem to follow me, 
Alcohol that my pops swallowed bottled me, 
No apology, I walk with a boulder on my shoulder, 
It's a Cold War, I'm a colder soldier, 
Hold the same fight that made Martin Luther the King, 
I ain't usin' it for the right thing, 
In between Lean and the fiends, hustle and the schemes, 
I put together pieces of a Dream 
I still have one 

[Chorus]

The world's seen me lookin' in the mirror, 
Images of me, gettin' much clearer, 
Dear Self, I wrote a letter just to better my soul, 
If I don't express it then forever I'll hold, inside 
I'm from a side where we out of control, 
Rap music in the 'hood played a fatherly role, 
My story's like yours, yo it gotta be told, 
Tryin' to make it from a gangsta to a godlier role, 
Read scrolls and stow slaves, 
And Jewish people in cold cage, 
Hate has no color or age, flip the page, 
Now my rage became freedom, 
Writin' dreams in the dark, they far but I can see 'em, 
I believe in Heaven more than Hell, 
Blessings more than jail, 
In the ghetto let love prevail, 
With a story to tell, my eyes see the glory and well, 
The world waitin' for me to yell ""I Have a Dream""

Cause ninety days without seeing you is crazy.
We got three days banging up in Shang Hi
Last day I see the water hanging in yo eye

But that's impossible when all I gotta say is bye

Lord come down and help us out
Send us an angel, help us out
SOS, help us out
Looking all around and I'm watching the world

[Verse 1]
People killing, people dying, people lying, people blind
People don't see the sign, watching money all the time
Get the pennies, get the dimes, get the dollars is the mind state
Of the human race, people on the paper chase
The environment is fragile, and we been on the gradual
Declining in a lifetime or lose the battle
Get burned by volcanoes, get blown by tornadoes
Cause mother nature signals, is trying to warn NATO
We got a new terror threat, it's called the weather
More deadlier than chemical and nuclear together
It's hotter in the winter, even hotter in the summer
Jesus, or Buddha, somebody come and help us out

[Chorus 1]
Lord come down and help us out
Send us an angel, help us out
SOS, help us out
Looking all around and I'm watching the world, changing
Open up your eyes, you can see things rearranging
The world is dying
And if they say it's gonna be alright, them people are lying

[Verse 2]
People trapped behind the gates, ignorance in their state of mind
Cause they formulate a plan just to penetrate us
You see they stimulate us with fear, manipulate us
Each year, they dominate dividing us like calculators
And we can't add it up cause calculators do the math for us
And here they come choppering down, chopping down our rainforest
Fucking up our air for us, they don't really care for us
But we can't complain, because the only one to blame is us
The gas is rising up but we keep on filling up
CO2 levels got the whole planet heated up
It's blazing in the winter, even hotter in the summer
Mohammed, Jehovah, somebody come and help us out

[Chorus 2]
Lord come down and help us out
Send us an angel, help us out
SOS, help us out
Looks like we ain't gon' figure it out
Lord come down and help us out


Send us an angel, help us out
SOS, help us out
Looking all around and I'm watching the world, changing
Open up your eyes, you can see things rearranging
The world is ending
And if they say it's gonna be okay, they just pretending

[Verse 2]
When the eskimo gets bit by a mosquito
Somebody in Miami will get swept by a tsunami
Rastas in Jamaica will get hit by a quake that
Registers something like 8.8
You see it's situations happening with our planet
Cause, 50 years ago we took it for granted
We should have took advantage, and reversed the damage
Instead of just pumping and selling and slanging the gas
And while we purchased the gas
We was watching soap operas while they steady brainwashed the masses
Cause we could make a vehicle that runs off ashes
But they own a patent for that, and that's exactly what's happening
Corruption and bullshit politics
The planet's gonna die cause of bullshit politics
It's hotter in the winter, even hotter in the summer
And ain't nobody coming to the rescue to help the

The oak when it blooms, a fox in the brush 
A knot in the wood, the song of a thrush

A scratch, a lump, it is nothing at all 
It's the wind blowing free, it's the end of the slope 
It's a beam it's a void, it's a hunch, it's a hope

It's the end of the strain 
The joy in your heart 
The foot, the ground, the flesh and the bone 
The beat of the road, a slingshot's stone 
A fish, a flash, a silvery glow 
A fight, a bet the fange of a bow 
The bed of the well, the end of the line 
The dismay in the face, it's a loss, it's a find

In the distance the shelves rode three shadows of blue

It feels like we're stuck inbetween 
A rock and a hard place, 
We've been through the heartaches 
And lived through the darkest days 

If you and I made it this far, 
Well then hey, we can make it all the way 
And they said no we can't 
And we said yes we can

How we let our little children just turn into goblins
Why we got them all killing and stealing and robbing
We need to plan a little seed to prevent the mobbing
Why don’t we teach them that science to reach for the stars?
'Cause they can be defiant with a future worse than ours
Don’t want them looking in the past and covering scars
They need a path out the ghetto, ghetto, hello.

And if that’s wrong, please don’t blame me,
'Cause where I live we have nothing

Little boy had a dream of being a ball player
'His little homie wanna grow to be a rhyme slayer,
Little missy wanna grow to be a model
While the momma at home just drinking on the bottle.
Aye, how come little one to grow and be a councilman?
Senator or governor, a mayor politician
Probably 'cause the politicians keep tricking ‘em
Promise that they fixing it but they ain’t really fixing it.
Aye, that’s why they want to be like me
Like Jigga like B and Nicky and Ri
Every day in the ghettos is an emergency
But the powers that be don’t emerge and seek
That’s why you see killing, that’s why you see crimes,
That’s why you see the homies in the prison doing time
That’s why you see crack, that’s why you see blacks trap

I was out of my mind
Turned up I was high as a kite
A jolly fellow
I was showing my bright whites
And getting trippy under the strobe lights
I'm loving the nightlife
And getting jiggy keeping the vibe right
Setting my mind a light
Getting the party hype

She's my type
Something's telling me
She ain't uptight
She's giving me the eyes like

I'm looking at her back like
Cool say no more
I save my jaw but I ain't playing
Are you fucking me?
I'm saying it raw
She didn't take no offence
I was straight in the door
I guess I hit her with an offer
That she couldn't ignore
It all happened so fast
Like I met her before
But I was so damn high
How could I be sure

Now it's totally on
Pour a couple more drinks
Put some Jodeci on
Put a towel under the door
And put the privacy on
We're stinking up the whole place
The weed's overly strong
We should be getting undressed
Now take off your thong
I'll help you with your bra strap
And then I hit you with the long and the strong
And you can make as much noise
Till your vocals are gone
It feels right coz it's totally wrong
But we're just living the good life
Like everyone should, right?
I'm giving her good pipe,
we're having a good night
I'm pretty sure one day
She'll be a good wife
And that's a good luck
But it's not in my foresight
But that don't matter now,
We're gonna fuck till the sunlight
I hit her from the back
Now I'm gripping the bumper tight

And you ain't gotta go home

And if it's all the same
I'm really glad you came
You kept me entertained
I weren't doin shit
I got a couple things
That I gotta do today
But I'm great and I'm really glad
I woke up with you today
I probably said a couple things
I don't usually say
And I know you're not a hoe
You don't usually play
You would never just leave
You would usually stay
Never had a one night stand
That's okay
Ain't got to explain

It's just an exchange

Brown paper baggin', baby mama naggin'

Pleasure and agony, black jeans Cagney
The wood is the wood, but the hood is like a cavity
So much tragedy, rarely see clarity

Home of the green leaf, watch out now
High school lesson, y'all can drop out now
California highway, California my way
I do it that way, then roll a fat jay
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la, look at me in my Cadillac car

In LA
The place where stars are born
And it ain't never cold outside
Because the rain will never storm

No refreshing these hoes, they keep shoppin'
Sunset droppin', chicken heads flockin'
No recess, my flows, there's no stoppin'
DeLorian rollin', pockets stay swollen
Drive down to (?), East Los is where I'm goin'
Cholo swagger, qe pasa wassup?
I'm rockin it, (inhale?)
LA native, LA Raider, LA Rams, motherfuckin' traitors
LA Clippers, LA Lakers, trippin' off Kobe, you the motherfuckin' greatest
LA Dodgers, finger to the Padres

It's time to blackout, time to spit this crack out
Niggas been finding for this shit, Aftermath crackhouse
The way I spit, niggas'll think I pulled the mack out
I said the way I spit, niggas'll think I blew J-Lo back out
Still Compton nigga, fuck y'all thought I went on vacation?
Same nigga that used to break in houses and steal PlayStation's
I hate waitin'
I told Dre to put out Detox, or I'mma do it
This is that nigga, The Chronic mixed with embalming fluid
Bring your chin here blood, so I can put this lama to it
Disrespectful nigga, see this window? I send your mama through it
Do it for the coast, so we can toast to it
Who showed you all the Pirus? The SA's and how the Los do it?
Similar to how the vice lords and folks do it

That, if you're poor, another day alive is a miracle
The blocks in Watts got crooked cops that frame the innocent
No different from Flint, Michigan

Inner cities the rich won't move to
The nice parts, they well-protected by a vanguard

Low-income housing, it dwells murderers

War to fight for the culture, instead we eaten by vultures
They mix us like mimosas, hang us on wanted posters
Asked for license and registration with they gun out the holster
Some of us guilty, some of us not, some of us filthy rich
Others just watch us niggas drive up the block
We think we keeping it one hundred coming back to the hood
They think we flossin' money, so they pull a ratchet: what's good?
It happens in Compton, happens in Queens, happened to Big L
Happened to Chinx and 2Pac in that passenger's seat
Sometimes it's internal, happens to you before you happen to bleed
What's beef? Cops killing niggas dead in the streets

Throwing threats at each other
Broken bottles and bar fights with box cutters
Alcoholics, narcotics, organized
Families sleep from a gas stove, burned alive
They bagging up drugs with plastic gloves
On his way to the top with his cash, he shrugs
Kidnappers, degenerate thieves and gamblers
Stealing, panhandlers, wrapping grams up
Rubber bands on they Grams, what?
Playing cards and they bored
Members of gangs, living by and dying by the sword
Block parties, fools stamp debit cards

We share the same dreams, same money
Same clothes and cars, instead we get the same jail bars

Hip-hop critics, sit the fuck down, get a chair or two
I ain't tryna kick knowledge, just a pair of graphic parables
Grew up, spent the whole middle school in the same pair of shoes
Me and my brother sharing shoes, my childhood was terrible
That's why I spend nights on the rooftop, smoking medical
You got a minute, my nigga? Let me break down the variables
Adapted to my surroundings, flow better than I used to
Momma, this for us buyers, for the days I wore FUBU
Having beaucoup dreams, deuce-deuce in jeans, my nigga

Or did you even understand 
A single word that I've said? 

I wonder why you do the things 
That, boy, you do to me 
I can't imagine why 
You treated me so horribly 
Are you listening to me 
Are you trying to ignore me 
Do I stutter when I speak? 

What ya gonna go, baby 
What ya gonna say 
I'm cutting you loose 
'Cause I got no time for you 
As a matter a fact, I won't look back 
I don't want you, I don't need you 
So let me tell you where its at 
I'm through with you

That you could be the person that I am 
So you can get inside exactly 
Where(?) I'm feel it

How to treat a lady 
And to be a real man 
You can't imagine what I think of

Will you ever comprehend, no

But I can't pretend

Is lonely and silent, the shades are all drawn,
And my heart is heavy as I gaze upon

Our beautiful garden has withered away,
Where you planted roses,the weeds seem to say,
A cottage for sale.

But when I reach a window, there's empty space.

But I'm sad to say I'm on my way
Won't be back for many a day
My heart is down, my head is turning around
I had to leave a little girl in Kingston town

Down the market you can hear
Ladies cry out while on their heads they bear
'Akey' rice, salt fish are nice
And the rum is fine any time of year

But I'm sad to say I'm on my way
Won't be back for many a day
My heart is down, my head is turning around
I had to leave a little girl in Kingston town

Sounds of laughter everywhere
And the dancing girls sway to and fro
I must declare my heart is there
Though I've been from Maine to Mexico

But I'm sad to say I'm on my way
Won't be back for many a day
My heart is down, my head is turning around
I had to leave a little girl in Kingston town

Down the way where the nights are gay
And the sun shines daily on the mountain top
I took a trip on a sailing ship
And when I reached Jamaica I made a stop

But I'm sad to say I'm on my way
Won't be back for many a day
My heart is down, my head is turning around
I had to leave a little girl in Kingston town

Sad to say I'm on my way
Won't be back for many a day
My heart is down, my head is turning around
I had to leave a little girl in Kingston town",Jamaica Farewell,2005
Willard White,"And now, the end is near
And so I face the final curtain
My friend, I'll say it clear
I'll state my case, of which I'm certain

I've lived a life that's full
I've traveled each and every highway
Oh, and more, much more than this
I did it my way

Regrets, I've had a few
But then again, too few to mention
I did what I had to do
And saw it through without exemption

I planned each charted course
Each careful step along the byway
But more, much more than this
I did it my way

Yes, there were times, I'm sure you knew
When I bit off more than I could chew
But through it all, when there was doubt
I ate it up and spit it out
I faced it all and I stood tall
And did it my way

I've loved, I've laughed and cried
Had my fill, my share of losing
And now, as tears subside
I find it all so amusing

To think I did all that
And may I say, not in a shy way
""Oh no, oh no not me
I did it my way""

For what is a man, what has he got?
If not himself, then he has naught
To say the things he truly feels
And not the words of one who kneels
The record shows I took the blows
And did it my way

The record shows I took the blows
And did it my way",My Way,2005
Willard White,"Some enchanted evening, you may see a stranger,
You may see a stranger across a crowded room,
And somehow you know, you know even then,
That somehow you'll see here again and again.

Some enchanted evening, someone may be laughing,
You may hear her laughing across a crowded room,
And night after night, as strange as it seems,
The sound of her laughter will sing in your dreams.

Who can explain it, who can tell you why?
Fools give you reasons, wise men never try.

Some enchanted evening, when you find your true love,
When you hear her call you across a crowded room,
Then fly to her side and make her your own,
Or all through your life you may dream all alone.

Once you have found her, never let her go,
Once you have found her, never let her go.",Some Enchanted Evening,2005

Man, King Screw, dedicate this to you my nigga
We love you forever boy (straight up much love)
We ain't goin' never forget you mayn
Never forget the times we had (G love, know I'm saying)
Al-D and Z-Ro (ha) South Park Mexican

[Chorus: x2]
I'll never forget, the times when we crawled together
I'll never forget, the times when we balled together
I'll never forget, the love, hugs, smiles and tears
And the strength to help me conquer my fears

[SPM]
I'll never forget, the day we met
I was on Gravestone, trying to find a address
You told me that your wife, had just lost your baby
I never met a man, so hate free
Lately, I've been drunk as fuck
I open up a cold beer, as soon as I wake up
I live in Screwston Texas, that's my home
Banging Screw since 9-2, ask my T. Jones
When Fat Pat died, we was all alone
That boy was the coldest, on the microphone
Screw took it harder, than anyone thought
It's hard to be apart, from someone close to your heart
South Park from the start, all of a sudden
The whole nation, all bout the Screw Shop on Cullen
November 16th, I sat and cried
Cause that was the day, that Houston Texas died

[Verse 2]
I'll never forget true love see, it's gon last forever
Keep my feet on solid ground, so we could ball together
Since a young one never done one, stay true to the heart
You kept my head above water, gave me spark from the start
You put the mic in my hand, plus put your trust in me
Dodging cases being a G, you got me out of the streets
Gave me the capital of Texas, so I could throw away the pyreeces
Put a queen on my shoulder, when nights were cold as misses
Hustling smiles appear the tears, the tears from younger years
Until they find us riders, make sure you standing here
S.U.C. for L-I-F-E, Screw blew one with the streets
Slowed down originator, keeping the trunk on beat
My faith in G-O-D, putting the world up under my feet
Making imitators duketators, bow down and can't compete
From a G to a G, this here's for you to me
Staying down putting it down, screaming Screw for eternity

[Chorus: x2]

[Verse 3]
Whoever knew he would create a new sound, never been heard
Transform a simple name, into a household word
He gained fame but never changed, never switched gears
When you met him it was like, you been knowing him twenty years
Was never fake, blessed to make the rap scene elevate
Genius, watch that boy slow it down and still accelerate
God gave him a gift, and my partna knew how to use it
But the love I got for Screw, ain't got nothing to do with music
Cause when he left, the physical was consumed
But his spirit manifesting, everybody in this room
A real partna forever, I know I can never be him
But if I make him my example, when you see me then you'll see him
S for slowing it down, see cold creating
are stands for realer than real, and never hating
E forever lasting, effect never corrupt
W for the world, cause that's what he screwed up

[Verse 4]
Man I'll never forget, the difference time can make
Man I'll never forget, coming down in the 8
Man I'll never forget, we drunk the pint straight
We been free styling, since them old grey tapes
And then came the day, that we was making them G's
Had them niggas lined up, like we was slanging them ki's
But we ain't slanging D, we just moving C.D.'s
People coming to the shop, way from over the seas
But still we some G's, or should I say that we back
Coming down in a Impala, with the candy wet
Coming down MLK, with the music that bump
We was swinging and banging, steady popping the trunk
Say what's up to that Gator, Mafio and that Pat
I know why y'all looking down from heaven, watching over our back
When they mention Screwed Up Click, they goin' say that we done it
Man them boys done blew up, like the flight 800

Represent S.U.C., forever my set
I'll never regret, the times we got blowed
On the road doing shows, all across the globe

Legendary status Screw, steady slowing it down
For H-Town for sure, we done lost a soldier
We goin' finish what you live, and I'ma put that on the Clover
It ain't over, pour and sipping the plain soda
Switching lanes over, in my black Range Rover
The Chemist that's right, I done shed some tears
All the car shows we wrecked, and bled for years
You one of my peers, DJ Screw you kept it real
You one of a kind, so you one out a mill
I'ma stay representing, South-side for live
And if S.U.C. get a deal, it's goin' be a hundred mill

If nobody else, could feel my pain
It was you in my corner, through the heat and the rain
Can't call one time, you didn't make me smile
Took a fall in the Penn, boy you fed my child
Kept my name on fire, like I never left
Kept your eyes on my family, and never slept
Snatched my ass out the streets, and put a mic in my hand
Put my strap on the shelf tray, my fiends for fans
I was hard head misled, seeking for bread
Without the music in my life, I know I would of been dead
But the Lord sent you to me, like a guardian angel
When my feet was caught up in a tangle
So please smile for me, cause Screw you got me throwed in this game
I salute you with my fist, your name was never in vein
See the plack on the wall, all our dreams came true
And I'm still giving thanks to you

Gets me craving of your own familiar situation *yeah)
Reach the unreachable, achieve the unbelievable
In the midst of all the madness, remember life's beautiful
Still I'm feeling restless, thinking I should rest less
Work more, play hard, ready for the encore

Never stray too far from home (yeah, yeah, yeah)

Maybe I should go

Go crazy, go insane, go for everything
Get the money, dollar bills in your wallet, say ka-ching
Sign the dealy, make a mili, sound famili?
The urgency is sounding the drilly for the ma-milli
And then they really talk in Braille, actin' chilly
They got me feelin' like an achilles, silly, silly, I mean, really?
Really, really, really really though?
Really, really, really though?

Love always leads to the highest sound
Many conversations, people makin' speculations
As to my procrastination due to my revelations
And then they get fugazi

Baby don't underestimate my underdog mentality
We 'bout to race ahead, ambition on Ferrari

Willem Dafoe,"Once upon a midnight dreary
As I pondered, weak and weary
Over many a quaint and curious
Volume of forgotten lore
While I nodded, nearly napping
Suddenly there came a tapping
As of some one gently rapping
Rapping at my chamber door
""'Tis some visitor,"" I muttered
""Tapping at my chamber door
Only this and nothing more.""

Muttering I got up weakly
Always I've had trouble sleeping
Stumbling upright my mind racing
Furtive thoughts flowing once more
I, there hoping for some sunrise
Happiness would be a surprise
Loneliness no longer a prize
Rapping at my chamber door
Seeking out the clever bore
Lost in dreams forever more
Only this and nothing more

Hovering my pulse was racing
Stale tobacco my lips tasting
Scotch sitting upon my basin
Remnants of the night before
Came again
Infernal tapping on the door
In my mind jabbing
Is it in or outside rapping
Calling out to me once more
The fit and fury of Lenore
Nameless here forever more

And the silken sad uncertain
Rustling of the purple curtain
Thrilled me, filled me
With fantastic terrors never felt before
So that now, oh wind, stood breathing
Hoping yet to calm my breathing
""'Tis some visitor entreating
Entrance at my chamber door
Some lost visitor entreating
Entrance at my chamber door
This it is, and nothing more.""

Deep into the darkness peering
Long I stood there
Wondering fearing
Doubting dreaming fantasies
No mortal dared to dream before
But the silence was unbroken
And the stillness gave no token
And the only word there spoken
Was the whispered name, ""Lenore.""
This I thought
And out loud whispered from my lips
The foul name festered
Echoing itself
Merely this, and nothing more

Back into my chamber turning
Every nerve within me burning
When once again I heard a tapping
Somewhat louder than before
""surely,"" said I
Surely that is something at my iron staircase
Open the door to see what threat is
Open the window, free the shutters
Let us this mystery explore
Oh, bursting heart be still this once
And let this mystery explore
It is the wind and nothing more

Just one epithet I muttered as inside
I gagged and shuddered
When with manly flirt and flutter
In there flew a stately raven
Sleek and ravenous as any foe
Not the least obeisance made he
Not a minutes gesture towards me
Of recognition or politeness
But perched above my chamber door
This fowl and salivating visage
Insinuating with its knowledge
Perched above my chamber door
Silent sat and staring
Nothing more

Askance, askew
The self's sad fancy smiles at you I swear
At this savage viscous countenance it wears
Though you show here shorn and shaven
And I admit myself forlorn and craven
Ghastly grim and ancient raven
Wandering from the opiate shores
Tell me what thy lordly name is
That you are not nightmare sewage
Some dire powder drink or inhalation
Framed from flames of downtown lore
Quotes the raven, ""nevermore.""

And the raven sitting lonely
Staring sickly at my male sex only
That one word
As if his soul in that one word
He did outpour, ""pathetic.""
Nothing farther than he uttered
Not a feather then he fluttered
Till finally was I that muttered as I stared
Dully at the floor
""other friends have flown and left me
Flown as each and every hope has flown before
As you no doubt will fore the morrow.""
But the bird said, ""never, more.""

Then I felt the air grow denser
Perfumed from some unseen incense
As though accepting angelic intrusion
When in fact I felt collusion
Before the guise of false memories respite
Respite through the haze of cocaine's glory
I smoke and smoke the blue vial's glory
To forget
At once
The base Lenore
Quoth the raven, ""nevermore.""

""Prophet,"" said I, ""thing of evil
Prophet still, if bird or devil
By that heaven that bend above us
By that God we both ignore
Tell this soul with sorrow laden
Willful and destructive intent
How had lapsed a pure heart lady
To the greediest of needs
Sweaty arrogant dickless liar
Who ascribed to nothing higher
Than a jab from prick to needle
Straight to betrayal and disgrace
The conscience showing not a trace.""
Quoth the raven, ""nevermore.""

""Be that word our sign of parting
Bird or fiend,"" I yelled upstarting
""get thee back into the tempest
Into the smoke filled bottle's shore
Leave no black plume as a token
Of the slime thy soul hath spoken
Leave my loneliness unbroken
Quit as those have quit before
Take the talon from my heart
And see that I can care no more
Whatever mattered came before
I vanish with the dead Lenore.""
Quoth the raven, ""nevermore.""

But the raven, never flitting
Still is sitting silent sitting
Above a painting silent painting
Of the forever silenced whore
And his eyes have all the seeming
Of a demon's that is dreaming
And the lamplight over him
Streaming throws his shadow to the floor
I love she who hates me more
I love she who hates me more
And my soul shall not be lifted from that shadow
Nevermore",The Raven,2003
Willemijn Verkaik,"The snow glows white on the mountain tonight
Not a footprint to be seen
A kingdom of isolation
And it looks like I'm the queen

The wind is howling like this swirling storm inside
Couldn't keep it in, heaven knows I've tried
Don't let them in, don't let them see
Be the good girl you always have to be
Conceal, don't feel, don't let them know
Well, now they know

Let it go, let it go
Can't hold it back anymore
Let it go, let it go
Turn away and slam the door
I don't care what they're going to say
Let the storm rage on
The cold never bothered me anyway

It's funny how some distance makes everything seem small
And the fears that once controlled me can't get to me at all
It's time to see what I can do
To test the limits and break through
No right, no wrong, no rules for me
I'm free

Let it go, let it go
I am one with the wind and sky
Let it go, let it go
You'll never see me cry
Here I stand and here I stay
Let the storm rage on

My power flurries through the air into the ground
My soul is spiraling in frozen fractals all around
And one thought crystallizes like an icy blast
I'm never going back, the past is in the past

Let it go, let it go
When I rise like the break of dawn
Let it go, let it go
That perfect girl is gone
Here I stand in the light of day
Let the storm rage on
The cold never bothered me anyway",Let It Go [From Frozen/Multi Language Medley],2014
Willi Dennis,"And now the purple dusk of twilight time
Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb
Always reminding me that we're apart
You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms
The nightingale 
Tells his fairytale
Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain
My stardust melody
The memory of love's refrain.",Stardust,2012
Willi Johanns & the RTS Big Band,"I used to have a perfect sweetheart
Not a real one, just a dream
A wonderful vision of us as a team
Can you imagine how I feel now
Love is real now, it's ideal
You're just what I wanted
And now it's nice to live
Paradise to live

I know why I've waited
Know why I've been blue
Prayed each night for someone
Exactly like you

Why should we spend money
On a show or two
No one does those love scenes
Exactly like you

You make me feel so grand
I want to hand the world to you
I hope you'll understand
Each foolish little scheme I'm schemin'
And dream I'm dreamin'

Now I know why mother
Taught me to be true
She meant me for someone
Exactly like you",Exactly Like You,2008

Boogie Down style, kid

Yo, they not HOT, all they do is talk a lot
That's not HOT, where's your respect on the block?
That's HOT, not cause you're friends with the cops
That's not HOT, a real MC you're not
I'm HOT, been hot, repeatedly heated
Don't call the teacher, hah, you best be seated
You got these kids gased up like you own the inventory
Fake muthafuckas ain't tellin the whole story
Tell em how you borrow from everyone you knew
And now that you're on top, they can't borrow from you
That's not hot, tell em how you love bein pop
Cause you was so broke before, sleepin cold on a cot
You don't rock, you grab money
Your crocks rock the spot and you grab them honeys
It's about to get ugly
I don't even go to these bullshit kiddie-ass clubs
You want to be a thug? Let's thug
First of all, soldiers speak to soldiers
Captains speak to captains
Lieutenant/lieutenant, cool?
But your first mistake is: he's steppin to me, rookie
Like you a O.G. and you just a run-up, fool
Who really got these streets on lock?
Whose name really holds high respect on the block?
Who opened up these clubs and taught you how to mix?
Who opened up these thugs from Compton to the Bricks?
I don't even sound like the rest of you kiddies
I study the ways of God, you studyin titties
And ass, I pity your class
Cause you come out with a blast
But you're trash, so you really don't last
They not HOT, all they do is talk a lot

This is hotter than heat, too deep, I'm on top of the streets
You weak, you ain't really rockin these beats
You ?????, you dress straight, eat straight
But you're a slave, and yo, you can't come up in a heat tank
G-o-d we thank, we watch what we sell
You better hope these Christians are wrong cause you goin to hell
Think about that when you're spittin your raps
And you call out KRS, I'll put you flat on your back
You're not HOT, all you do is talk a lot

William Ash,"You ain't never been blue; no, no, no, 
You ain't never been blue, 
Till you've had that mood indigo. 
That feelin' goes stealin' down to my shoes
While I just sit here and sigh, ""Go 'long blues"".

I always get that mood indigo, 
Since my baby said goodbye. 
And in the evenin' when the lights are low, 
I'm so lonely I could cry. 
'Cause there's nobody who cares about me, 
I'm just a poor fool that's bluer than blue can be.

I could lay me down and die.

William Ash,"A country dance was being held in a garden
I felt a bump and heard an ""Oh, beg your pardon""
Suddenly I saw polka dots and moonbeams
All around a pug-nosed dream

The music started and was I the perplexed one
I held my breath and said ""May I have the next one?""
In my frightened arms, polka dots and moonbeams
Sparkled on a pug-nosed dream

There were questions in the eyes of other dancers
As we floated over the floor
There were questions but my heart knew all the answers
And perhaps a few things more

Now in a cottage built of lilacs and laughter
I know the meaning of the words ""Ever after""
And I'll always see polka dots and moonbeams
When I kiss the pug-nosed dream",Polkadots and Moonbeams,2004
