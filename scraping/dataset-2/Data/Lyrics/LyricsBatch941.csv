Robie Lester,"Through all our days
In tender ways
Her love for us was shown
And so, you see
We can't leave her alone
She's always say
That we're the greatest
Treasure she could own
Because with us
She never felt alone
Her troubles would disappear
Long as she could have us near
Darling, can't you see
We're her only family!
Her days were filled
With happy hours
Although her youth had flown
And that is why
She never felt alone",She Never Felt Alone [From the Aristocats],2009
Robie Lester,"Do mi sol do do sol mi do
Every truly cultured music student knows
You must learn your scales and your arpeggios
Bring the music ringing from your chest
And not your nose
While you sing your scales and your arpeggios

If your faithful to your daily practicing
You will find you progress is encouraging
Do mi sol me do mi sol me fa la sol it goes
When you do your scales and your arpeggios

Do mi so do
(Fast piano music playing)

Do mi sol do do sol mi do do mi sol do do sol mi do
Though at first it seems as though it doesn't show
Like a tree ability will bloom and grow
If you're smart you'll learn by heart what every artist knows
Your must sing your scales
And your arpeeee ee eeggioooooooooos!",Scales and Arpeggios [From The Aristocats],2013
Robie Lester,"Well, little lady, let me elucidate here

Everybody wants to be a cat
Because a cat's the only cat who knows where it's at
Tell me, everybody's pickin' up on that feline beat
'Cause everything else is obsolete
A square with a horn
Makes you wish you weren't born
Every time he plays
But with a square in the act
You can set music back
To the caveman days

I've heard some corny birds who tried to sing
Still a cat's the only cat
Who knows how to swing
Who wants to dig a long-haired gig stuff like that?
When everybody wants to be a cat

A square with a horn
Makes you wish you weren't born
Every time he plays
Oh riki-tiki-tinky
With a square in the act
You can set music back to the caveman days (Oh riki-tiki-tinky)

Everybody wants to be a cat
Because a cat's the only cat who knows where it's at
When playin' jazz he always has a welcome mat
'Cause everybody digs a swingin' cat

If you want to turn me on
Play your horn don't spare the tone
And blow a little soul into the tune

Let's take it to another key
Modulate, and wait for me
I'll take a few ad-libs and pretty soon
The other cats will all commence
Congregatin' on the fence
Beneath the alley's only light
Where every note is out of sight

Everybody, everybody
Everybody wants to be a cat
Hallelujah
Everybody, everybody
Everybody wants to be a cat
Everybody, everybody
Everybody wants to be a cat
Everybody, everybody
Everybody wants to be a cat",Ev'rybody wants to be a cat,2015

Robillard,"There ain't nothin' I can do, or nothin' I can say
That folks don't criticise me,
But I'm going to do just as I want to anyway,
And don't care if you all despise me!

If I should take a notion
To jump into the ocean,

If I go to church on Sunday,
Then just shimmy down on Monday,

And I say, ""Take all mine, honey"",

If I give him my lasy nickel,
And it leaves me in a pickle,
'T'aint nobody's business if I do, if I do!

Than to jump right up and quittin' me,

Robin,"Tommi ja mä
Kaupungilla taas
Illat rullaillaan

Kevätillassa, kauniissa
Äänet kaikuu taas

Ei huolia, ei murheita

Robin,"My telephone rang I was too late
Why did I stop to hesitate
On my way home
Take my hands let me confess
'Bout loving and hating and all of the rest
And ideas I've roamed

Then I saw a brilliant sign
And let it slip behind
And search again and
Find I'm blind

My thoughts they make a tender smile
My hands they move and in a while
I've got what I want.
That tenderness that you insist you feel
Ain't worth a damn 'cause it ain't real
Lord it sure does haunt.

Then you saw a brilliant sign
And let it slip behind
And search again and find you're blind.

See me in a lonely Sunday
If you've got the time
And don't surprise me or you'll find
That I'm completely blind.

Now I'm so sick of what's being said
My thoughts they burn inside my head
There's not much untouched.
All of my children begin to cry
They clutch at me demanding why
Tell 'em 'bout loving and such.

Then they saw a brilliant sign
And let it slip behind
And search again and find they're blind.

See them in a lonely Sunday
If you've got the time
And don't surprise them or you'll find
That they're completely blind
That they're completely blind.",Blind,1973
Robin,"Yes I'm Falling
Oh oh falling
Falling in love with you
Was easy as the day
A down man looked up to see
Nice things in his way
Falling in love with you
Was like that first sunrise
Was it in my window
Or was it in your eyes

And I call myself an island
And luckily I find
That you're the sea around me
And are with me for all time

Falling in love with you
Was learning how to cry
And telling you I'm all alone
Oh please don't pass me by
Falling in love with you
Was learning how to see
That you are you and I am me
And how fine that can be

And I call myself an island
And luckily I find
That you're the sea around me
And are with me for all time",Falling in Love With You,1973
Robin,"If I needed someone to love
You're the one that I'd be thinking of
If I needed someone 

If I had some more time to spend
Then I guess I'd be with you my friend
If I needed someone
Had you come some other day
Then it might not have been like this
But you see now I'm too much in love 

Carve your number on my wall
And maybe you will get a call from me
If I needed someone
Ah, ah, ah, ah 

If I had some more time to spend
Then I guess I'd be with you my friend
If I needed someone
Had you come some other day

Robin,"Somewhere over the rainbow, way up high
There's a land that I've heard of once in a lullaby.
Somewhere over the rainbow, skies are blue
And the dreams that you dare to dream,
Really do come true.

Someday I'll wish upon a star
And wake up where the clouds are far behind me.
Where troubles melt like lemon drops,
High above the chimney tops,
That's where you'll find me.

Somewhere over the rainbow, blue birds fly
Birds fly over the rainbow
Why then, oh why can't I?
If happy little bluebirds fly beyond the rainbow
Why, oh why can't I?

Somewhere over the rainbow, way up high
There's a land that I've heard of once in a lullaby.

Robin,"You abandoned me
Love don't live here anymore
Just a vacancy
Love don't live here anymore

When you lived inside of me
There was nothing I could conceive
That you wouldn't do for me
Trouble seemed so far away
You changed that right away, baby

You abandoned me
Love don't live here anymore
Just a vacancy
Love don't live here anymore

Love don't live here anymore
Just emptiness and memories
Of what we had before
You went away
Found another place to stay, another home

You abandoned me
Love don't live here anymore
Just a vacancy
Love don't live here anymore

Tonight I'm gonna find me a shawty,
Freshest thing in the club,

But first I gotta get me some love,

And she's connected, connected, connected, yeah,

If you're looking at my girl you better smack yourself,
'Cause you ain't getting money if your stack's on her,
Little boys spending all of daddy's bankroll wealth,

And girl don't be acting all prude,
I got pictures on my phone of you acting all nude,
And don't think the dudes be acting all you,

Robin & Linda Williams,"As I walked out one evening
To breathe the air and soothe my mind,
I thought of friends and the home I had,
And all those things I left behind.

A silent star shone on me,
My eyes saw a far horizon,
As if to pierce this veil of time,
And escape this earthly prison.

Will there come a time when the memories fade.
and pass on with the long, long years,
When the ties no longer bind?
Lord save me from this darkest fear.
Don't let me come home a stranger,
I couldn't stand to be a stranger. ",Don't Let Me Come Home a Stranger,1984
Robin & Linda Williams,"Last night I came home, but you weren't there, 
Found all my things, thrown everywhere. 
No one to talk to, no one to talk to but the blues 

Oh I read your letter, signed, ""I love you"", 
But in your letter, said we were through. 
No one to talk to, no one to talk to but the blues 

Sometimes, when we quarrel, 
The things that are said 
Can make, you feel bitter, 
When you'd rather feel love instead 

Well come on back home, where you belong, 
I love you baby, yes, I was wrong. 
No one to talk to, no one to talk to but the blues

Robin & Linda Williams,"We had our day, and now it's over
We had our song, and now it's all sung
We took our stroll through summer's clover
But summer's gone, baby, and the walking's done.
So, tell me gently, who'll be your lover?
Who'll be your lover after I am gone?
Will it be the moon that hears your sighing?
Will it be the willow that hears your lonesome sigh?
Will it be the rain that clings to your bosom?
Will it be the sunshine that dries your golden hair?
Will it be the wind that warns of my returning?
Will the rose be in your arms when I find you waiting there?
None but the rain shall cling to my bosom
None but the moon shall hear my lonesome sighs
None but the wind shall warn of my returning
So fare thee well, my love, goodbye.",None But the Rain,1984
Robin & Linda Williams,"I left my home in the late part of the day
Heading east before a sinking sun
The snow was melting though just barely
On the wind-blown and rain-soaked prairie
I wondered, would the journey once begun
Lead me back or to somewhere far away?

CHORUS:
I spoke to you in my mind
I tried the right words to find
Though the words were not for you to hear
They were meant but for my ear
They were thoughts that came to me out on the road
To put down in the letter that I wrote

I loved you as I've told you
When no one else had kindness to share
I gave you all I had to give
You were the reason I had to live
Still I wonder as I leave in deep despair
Were you someone that I never knew

CHORUS:

When at last I stopped to take my rest
I took pen and paper in my hand
I began to tell you every heartache
Every way I suffered for you sake
But the weariness I could not stand
I fell sleeping as the sun sank in the west

And I dreamed we were pebbles by the sea
On a blue world spinning through space
In a dark and empty universe
Where solitude is the curse
And sorrow speaks from every face
And the tides wash us to our destiny",Letter That I Wrote,1998
Robin & Linda Williams,"Sheʼs a master at deceiving 
But he finally learned the truth
He licked his wounds and stopped the bleeding 
But his scars are living proof
She took everything she needed 
The wreckage never follows her
She leaves it with the ones still grieving 
For things to be the way they were

[Chorus]
We donʼt hear much news from Arizona 
She said sheʼd be back in the fall
But itʼs warm and sunny in Sedona 
And I donʼt think sheʼll be coming back at all

Now sheʼs way up in the pinons 
Some place sheʼs never been before
Sheʼll never look back on Virginia 
Now sheʼs found another open door
Sheʼs used to moving in and out 
Thereʼs nothing she canʼt leave behind
Lifeʼs too short and not about 
A ring or towing some old line

[Chorus]

Everyone does what they must 
He knew the odds were risky
He sits in the dying dusk 
And pours another whisky
Still he held on to his pride 
Through all the doubt and suspicion
And all the hollow spin she tried 
To use for ammunition

[Chorus]",Arizona,2012
Robin & Linda Williams,"When our love was young 
We were in a hurry
To get some living done 
We took no time to worry 
That hearts could break and sorrowed wait
On the backside of the pleasure
We thought those days were going to last 
Forever

[Chorus]
Forever makes no guarantees
It's only faithful to your memory
Mine to have and hold eternally
Today, tomorrow 
Forever

Our love had a power 
That cannot be denied
But like a flower, 
it withered and died
Now I canʼt pretend that timeʼs a friend 
Or life holds any treasure
When every minute seems to last 
Forever

[Chorus]

I think of you 
As the days drag on
As I stumble through 
The dark searching for the dawn
By and by the tears will dry
And the storms will all be weathered
But you will live in my heart

Have you anything to say to me?
Won't you tell me where my love can be?
Is there a meadow in the mist
Where someone's waiting to be kissed?

Have you seen a valley green with spring?
Where my heart can go a journeying
Over the shadows and the rain
To a blossom covered lane

And in your lonely flight

Wonderful music, faint as a will o' the wisp
Crazy as a loon, sad as a gypsy serenading the moon

Robin Aleman,"Listen to the melody entrancing
Blending in a soft and sweet refrain
As around the floor, dear, we are dancing
Swaying to a fascinating strain
 
Sweet music soft and mellow
Soothing and slow
Strains of a mellow 'cello
When lights are low 
Dear, we're so close together I love you so 
Why think about the weather 
When lights are low 
Two hearts revealing
Music hath charms 
Life's so appealing
With inspiration, in your arms 
Our lips meeting soft and tender 
Love's all aglow 
Why shouldn't we surrender 
When lights are low
 
Listen how happy hearts are beating
Like the ocean beats upon the sand
And our feet in rhythm keep repeating
Ev'ry little movement of the band
 
Sweet music soft and mellow
Soothing and slow
Strains of a mellow 'cello
When lights are low 
Dear, we're so close together I love you so

When lights are low

Tell me why I can't see where I'm goin(No)
When everybody else see's,where I'm comin from
And I don't know why I travel down these dead end roads
I gotta turn this car around-and find my way home

When you listen to my music do you feel my shit
Look I don't need punchlines cause I live my shit
A lot of cats selling they soul for radio play
That's why we need mo' rappers like Common and Kayne
Niggas scared to be broke so they fake it,to make it
If my album went gold I'd still be the greatest
Back in the days I would get caught for trulency
But now I'm puttin' money back in my community
I took my homies out the hood now they got jobs
Cause it's more to life then dodgin' cop cars
I played the block hard,now I play the pop charts
Now I'm gettin' dumb money,cause I got smart

[Chorus]

Ayo I never seen a man cry,till I seen a man die
So when you talk to me look me in my damn eyes
Cause I been through it all and my scars prove it
Cause when it come to that paper homie I'm a do it
I just rhyme part time you better know it
These lines comin' from my mind so I never wrote it
Keep my nine by my spine so I never show it
Yeah I'm addicted to pine but I never grow it
And the reason I got signed cause I'm a poet
Half of my niggas doin' time but I'm focused
That's why I'm stayin' on my grind if you haven't noticed
That old Cadillac transformed to a Lotus

[Chorus]

When ya new album drop everybody ya friend
Niggas actin' like they down but I know they pretend
I use to scrap up money for studio time
I'm like Jay Z homie I remember my rhymes
Ain't nobody help me out when my cash was low
Bills comin' too fast so I had to blow
And I walked by faith,not by sight

Fire 

You know there's a fire 
You started a fire 
Burnin' in my heart 
My desire caught fire baby 
From just one tiny spark 

Now it's outta control 
Spreadin' through my soul 
It's been deliberately set 
Gonna get even hotter yet 

Burnin' me up 
You started a fire 
A burnin' in my heart 
You started a fire 
Burnin' in my heart and soul 

Baby with your love 
I burst into flames 
When I called out your name 
And suddenly I was engulfed 

Now my whole life's on fire 
Flames keep gettin' higher and higher 
In the feat of the night 
I get the fever 
But it feels all right

Robin Batteau,"It was down by old Joe's barroom, on the corner of the square
They were serving drinks as usual, and the usual crowd was there
On my left stood Big Joe McKennedy, and his eyes were bloodshot red
And he turned his face to the people, these were the very words he said

I was down to St. James infirmary, I saw my baby there
She was stretched out on a long white table, 
So sweet, cool and so fair

Let her go, let her go, God bless her
Wherever she may be
She may search this whole wide world over
Never find a sweeter man as me

When I die please bury me in my high top Stetson hat
Put a twenty dollar gold piece on my watch chain
The gang'll know I died standing pat

Let her go, let her go God bless her
Wherever she may be
She may search this wide world over
Never find a sweeter man as me

I want six crapshooters to be my pallbearers
Three pretty women to sing a song
Stick a jazz band on my hearse wagon
Raise hell as I stroll along

Let her go Let her go
God bless her
Wherever she may be
She may search this whole wide
World over
She'll never find a sweeter
Man as me",St. James Infirmary,1986

Robin Beck,"Johnny saw her riding on a street car named desire
His fate was sealed
She could see him coming like a hundred other liars
It was no big deal

Rosa had a lover on the shady side of town
Tito he was king of the street
She was his possession like a jewel in his crown
Johnny better run better run

Better hide your heart better hold on tight
Better say your prayers 'cause there's trouble tonight
When pride and love battle with desire
Better hide your heart 'cause you're playing with fire

The ride was over but the story doesn't end
He took her heart
She looked him in the eye and said they couldn't meet again
You could see the trouble start

The word went out that Rosa's messing with someone
It was on the street
Tito looked for Johnny with a vengeance and a gun
Johnny better run better run

Better hide your heart better hold on tight
Better say your prayers 'cause there's trouble tonight
When pride and love battle with desire
Better hide your heart 'cause you're playing with fire

Johnny's holding Rosa on a roof-top in the night
As time stood still
They couldn't hear him coming till he had them both in sight
You could feel a chill

A shot rang out like thunder
And the blood was on her hands
With nothing won when someone lies there dying
Lovers finally understand

Better hide your heart better hold on tight
Better say your prayers 'cause there's trouble tonight
When pride and love battle with desire
Better hide your heart 'cause you're playing with fire

When all alone what do we desire
Better hide your heart 'cause you're playing with fire
When pride and love battle with desire
Better hide your heart 'cause you're playing with fire",Hide Your Heart,1989

In an eight room farmhouse, baby
When my brothers and friends were around
There was always somethin' doin'
Had me a couple of real nice girlfriends
Stopped by to see me every once in a while
When I think back about those days
All I can do is sit and smile

That's when smoke was a smoke
And groovin' was groovin'
And dancin' meant everything
We were young and we were improvin'
Laughin' laughin' with our friends
Holding hands meant somethin' baby

The winter days they last forever
And the weekends went by so quick
We ridin' around this little country town
We were goin' nuts, girl, out in the stick
One night me with my big mouth
A couple guys had to put me in my place
When I see those guys these days
We just laugh and say

If we've done any wrong
I hope that we're forgiven
Got a few kids on my own

Birds fly over the rainbow
Why then, oh why can't I?
If happy little bluebirds fly beyond the rainbow
Why, oh why can't I?

Somewhere over the rainbow, way up high
There's a land that I've heard of once in a lullaby.
Somewhere over the rainbow, skies are blue
And the dreams that you dare to dream,
Really do come true.

Someday I'll wish upon a star
And wake up where the clouds are far behind me.
Where troubles melt like lemon drops,
High above the chimney tops,
That's where you'll find me.

Somewhere over the rainbow, blue birds fly
Birds fly over the rainbow
Why then, oh why can't I?
If happy little bluebirds fly beyond the rainbow
Why, oh why can't I?","Sobre el Arco Iris [From ""El Mago de Oz""]",2000

And it flows through you
And it flows through me
And I love you so much more

Are you just a dream to fade away

And the tears we had to pay (you hade to cry)

Robin Greenstein,"My father used to tell me, don't live your life alone
You'll want someone to be there late at night when you get home
We were sitting in a cafe, I could have cried right then & there 
Face to face with loneliness that father & daughter shared

Chorus:
Is it too late for me,
I've spent a lifetime searching
Somebody please find me
I need someone who like me
Is also searching

Well I came close so often I thought that he might be the one
He only wanted company while he shined in the sun
And now I toss and turn at night, afraid I'll never find
The one who is my other half, the one meant to be mine

Some men seek for riches
Others search for fame
Everybody looks for love

To please or make you mad
Missed your clean lonely heart
Spill things fresh as sugar

Come see me

Oh, what woman can sing without loving the primitive heart?

Stay, stay, caught in a surfacing state Though the soul must convey
Some more tears to delete

To quiz of making man

To give me transcendent experiences
To transport me out of self and aloneness
And alienation into a sense of
Oneness and connection ecstatic and magical
I became a junkie for it
I came looking for the next high
And I'm sorry
I've been putting the search on the wrong place
I understand that you're confused
Feeling overwhelmed
Well that's a feeling state from then
The reality, with cleaning up my emotion of life
And I'm getting in touch with myself
I'm beginning to ground myself
In my own sense of being as an entity
One entity on the planet
Becoming truly self-reliant and become connected
With something beyond me
That is where I have to go
I'm so sorry I've been putting the search on the wrong place
You're lost and don't know what to do
But that's not all of you

And when I step back from all this I see that I'm fighting

Robin Jones,"Sometimes I can be up like that, when I don't cross myself with you
Sometimes I can be down like that, when I don't cross myself with you
I'm dysmorphic in doses
Imagine trying to
Shit out
Twelve red roses
It's how I do but not everybody knows it. 
Imagine how I'd feel to be called a promotionalist, a mitt man, an emotionalist.
When I don't cross myself with you
Sometimes I can be up like that, when I don't cross myself with you
Sometimes I can be down like that, when I don't cross myself with you
It's some kind 
Psychosis, don't what you call it, oneness might be the closest.
A psychotropic segment so tasteless,
it tastes sweet.
And then it changes,
When I don't cross myself with you
Sometimes I can be up like that, when I don't cross myself with you
Sometimes I can be down like that, when I don't cross myself with you",Easy,2005
Robin Jones,"Hey now sister won't you come and bless my soul 
I been along time comin down the mountainside 
You see I fell from a spaceship I was taken for a little ride 
And I'd very much like to fall in love with you 
If you would if you would I'd like to know 
will you think of me when I'm gone? 

Sister live a long time I don't want to fight with you 
See my head's in a vice and I don't know who I am anymore 
And when I wake in the morning and I look through my window 
I see sun skies sand sea would you fill your heart with me 
If you would, I'd like to know 
will you think of me when I'm gone?

Robin Lamont,"You are the light of the world!
You are the light of the world!
But if that light is under a bushel
Brrr, it's lost something kind of crucial

You got to stay bright to be the light of the world
You are the salt of the earth, you are the salt of the earth
But if that salt has lost it's flavor, it ain't got much in its favor
You can't have that fault and be the salt of the earth!

So let your light so shine before men
Let your light so shine
So that they might know some kindness again
We all need help to feel fine
(Let's have some wine!)

You are the city of God
You are the city of God
But if that city's on a hill, it's kinda hard to hide it well
You've got to stay pretty in the city of God

You are the light of the world, you are the light of the world
But the tallest candlestick
Ain't much good without a wick
You've got to stay bright to be the light of the world

You've got to live right to be the light of the world

All dressed up like a downtown Christmas tree

Who taught her how to jerk and understand
Then she became a rock 'n' roll music fan

Her partner can't hardly hold her
Because she never gets any older

And the famous singer sang and bowed away
When the stars were gone she screamed and yelled hurray

Five thousand tongues are screaming out ""More"" and ""More""

A square with a horn

But with a square in the act

Still a cat's the only cat
Who knows how to swing
Who wants to dig a long-haired gig stuff like that?

Play your horn don't spare the tone
And blow a little soul into the tune

Robin McAuley,"It started with a smile.
With a touching glance
From right across the room
To start our new romance
Never said a word
But the air was full of talk
In next to no time.
We were laughin' at each other's jokes
You knew that I believed in you
Didn't know you'd scare that easy

You shut me out completely

For our love is indeed
The greatest love

Do you know what friends are for?
We made love most every day
Is that the kind of friend
You're lookin' for?
Said you wonna be alone
That you ain't got time for love
But don'f forget who you're talkin' to
I was all of that above
Tell me what you're gonna do
When you wake up felling lonely
Will you pick up the phone and call me
And tell me you've changed your mind
I don't understand. 
I'm a lovin' man
Said I made you feel like nobody else
Can I love you more
Said I found your secret door
Like a thief in the night
You walked out of my life
If it takes a lifetime.

But remember one thing, don't lose your head to a woman that'll spend your bread
So I got out
 
Paris was a place you could hide away, if you felt you didn't fit in
French police wouldn't give me no peace, they claimed I was a nasty person
Down along the left bank, minding my own
Was knocked down by a human stampede
Got arrested for inciting a peaceful riot, when all I wanted was a cup of tea
I was accused
 
I moved on
Down in rome I wasn't getting enough 
Of the things that keep a young man alive
My body stunk, but I kept my funk at a time when I was right out of luck
Getting desperate, indeed I was looking like a tourist attraction
Oh, my dear, I better get out of here for the vatican don't give no sanction
I wasn't ready for that, no, no
 
I moved right out east, yeah
On the peking ferry I was feeling merry, sailing on my way back here
I fell in love with a slant-eyed lady by the light of an eastern moon
Shanghai lil never used the pill, she claimed that it just ain't natural
She took me up on deck and bit my neck
Oh, people, I was glad I found her
Oh, yeah, I was glad I found here
 
I firmly believed that I didn't need anyone but me
I sincerely thought I was so complete  
Look how wrong you can be
The women I've known I wouldn't let tie my shoe 
They wouldn't give you the time of day
But the slant-eyed lady knocked me off my feet
God, I was glad I found her
 
And if they had the words I could tell to you 
To help you on your way down the road
I couldn't quote you no dickens, shelley or keats

You must know failure before success

Cocaine was the thing that I took on
And nowhere was the place that I was
Going (preacher, c'mon on)
I must tell the truth, I cannot lie
I was headed for the kill, steal, destroy, and die
Top to the bottom to bottom to top
Success is where I'm headed there ain't no doubt

But the truth is what we need to reach our point
I had to give this message the so-called truth
I hope it's something in it that's there for you

When my lips eclipse the sun and the moon
Reflecting from the wet
When the blood of my love outraces
Every one of the stallions in your pack, that's when
You go, you go, you go 2 the max. you go

The max (to the max)
The max (oh, get funky)
The max (get-get-get funky) (to the max)
The max (get funky)

Let' go
I think I'm gonna like this

Let's go (dance)
I want to dance
Let's go
Let's go
Let's go (Oh yeah yeah!)

I go to the max
I'm not afraid (oh my god)
I want to dance

Then listen,
When the going gets tougher than the tough can go
I grind the axe, that's when I go, I go, I go 2 the max. I go

The max, yo baby, tell me where the party's at
The max, yo baby, I want to shuffle the cards in that stack
The max, we can dance if you want 2, but I might break yo back
The max, more funk for your buck you can bet on that

This is the max

Dear love, dear love, dear love
Forgive me for my sins
But you left me in such a cold cold world to suffer in (kick it)
And Contrary to popular belief
Even though one's life is brief
If you go there once you
Come again and again and
Let's go

(I'm so sorry for you)

Robin Power,"He realized that she was new to love
Naive in every way
Every schoolboy's fantasy she was
That's why he had to wait
If he poured his heart into a glass
And offered it like wine
She could drink and be back in time for the morning papers
They could take a walk down the ocean side
Make a wish on every wave
They could find a carousel
And ride or kiss in every cave
They could contemplate the entire universe
Or just one star
Or just how far was the walk for the morning papers

Let me play it for you one time, oh oh
Well
Hey
Shucks

Why is age more than a number when it comes to love?
Should we ask the ones who speculate
When they don't know what it's made of?
Should we ask the moonlight on your face
Or the raindrops in your hair
Or should we ask the man who wrote it there in the morning papers?

Should we ask the moonlight on your face

Picking up the papers with his worn out shoes

Dirt in her hair and her clothes in rags

And say for you that the sun don't shine
Let me take you by the hand and lead you through the streets of London
I'll show you something to make you change your mind

Looking at the world over the rim of his teacup
And each tea lasts an hour and he wanders home alone

And say for you that the sun don't shine
Let me take you by the hand and lead you through the streets of London
I'll show you something to make you change your mind

Have you seen the old man outside the seaman's mission
Memory fading with the medal ribbons that he wears
And in the winter city, the rain cries a little pity
For one more forgotten hero, and a World that doesn't care

I ain't gonna lie, If I wasn't doing this now

With their eyes on a couple of pies

Where, outta  nowhere, you in the bus, hands is cuffed
Can't call your Mom, dog, you know times is rough
you was out yesterday, stressing a better way
Funny thing, they always seem to lock down Kings
And the thugs on the street just love to say, ""It's all foul.""
Watch the honeys check your style
Worthless, when they worship, what you purchase
They only see ice, not me, under the surface
What's the purpose? I just, go my way
Know my way, 'till bullets blow my way
Which they might, 'cause any night can change your life
Keep your state of mind tight and remain alright
It's plain to fight, but different to shoot
And might do it 
If you ain't 10 different ways to get loot.

Holding heat

To give you garbage, slide the butters to their mans
That's aiight, though
'Cause even ready rock gets sold on our block
Watch us turn nothing into nitro
And we don't mingle
'Cause none of us don't really know you
From the heart, we never talk to strangers
So why start?
Anyway, we're rapping for this luxury shit
I watch wild niggas blow
See how plush shit can get
But we ain't trying to kiss ass to blow up fast
We gonna take our time and rely strictly on the rhyme
If I, wasn't that cat, Sheek Lucian, that rap
Would you still be my man
And pass your bottle to my hand
Would I be in the rain
While you pass me in the Land
Oh, you think by now that I don't already know your plan
To get next to me and possibly sex me
Then slip Ecstasy inside a nigga's Pepsi
Money'll never amount to respect, B
And you don't wanna test me
'Cause God blessed me.

Take me and do as you will
Have what you want, your way's always the best way
I have succumbed to this passive sensation
Peacefully falling away
I am the zombie, your wish will command me
Laugh as I fall to my knees

Can I control this empty delusion?
Lost in the fire below
And you come running your eyes will be open
And when you come back, I'll be as you want me
Only so eager to please
My little song will keep you beside me
Thinking your name as I sing

No, you can't help it if you have been tempted
By fruit hanging ripe on the tree
And I feel useless
Don't care what the truth is
You will be here come the day
Truth do you hear me?
Don't try to come near me
So tired I sleep through the lie
If you desire to lay here beside me
Come to my sweet melody

Don't need me for the weekend
To do what the hell

I'm callin up my friends

Rollin down the coast, the cops on the rear
Goin where the ladies want Tequila & Beer
I'm lookin at the Mami
And where she goes I'm following

Chorus: Bailes why singe conmigo
Quiero que te vengas conmigo amor
Quiero que tu bailes why SIGUE conmigo
Quiero que te vengas conmigo amor
Anywhere we go

We talk and we touch, ooh
I like her so much
A walk on the beach and all the way home
She shows me to her room

Time is flyin till her brother arrives
He's throwin sneakers at my head
And the CDs are flyin

Baby, you can do your time on me
I can't let you go, I can't let you go

You were late to school
I'm gonna have 2 see you after class
You've been a bad girl
Someone's gonna have 2 teach you a lesson
You've been a bad girl
Someone's gonna have 2 straighten you right out (Straighten you out)
You've been a bad girl, bad girl
Someone's gonna have 2 teach you
Teach you, teach you, teach you
Teach you, teach you, teach you

Just for the moment for 2night
Can I make you mine?
Is it me? Is it us?
Can I love you all my life?",Teach U a Lesson,2006
Robin Thicke,"Yeah, ladies and gentlemen
I'll like to thank you all for coming out tonight
It's my third album, third tour, third time's a charm

Girl when I go, I really like it 
When you roll with me, I got doe, 
The-kinda-paper-you can-blow with me, 
And babe I know, that money ain't everything, 
But its for sure, you pay for nothing 
When you fuck with me, when I go

[Chorus]
Follow my lead, baby I could be all you need, if you follow my lead
Follow my lead, I'll hold you down put your trust in me, baby follow my lead
Follow my lead, I think god made you for me, follow my lead
Follow my lead, I'm the one girl in time you'll see
If you follow my lead

Don't listen to the rumors they say 50 fuckin' crazy
50 don't know how to treat a lady
They wrong, I like you a lot I don't wanna hurt you
But I call a square a square and a circle a circle
So if you act like a bitch, I call you a bitch then hang up
Probably call you right back and shit
And I have to say baby I apologize, cross my fingers god forgive me for
Tellin' lies
Like Janet Jackson say ""I miss you much, I really wanna feel your touch""
And smell your scent, baby I could pass the day, watchin' you model lingerie""
I wanna spend the night tonight shorty if its okay
You can be my beyonce I'll be your jay
Ha ha
I gotta great sense of humor, first I'll make ya smile then I whoo ya!
You know how I do ya, or do ya?

[Chorus]

After seven hours new york, to London, 
You wonderin' whats gonna be the next stop
I told you, im'a don you gonna know I'ma don
After you shop 'till your feet hurt in Milan
Now take a picture these are moments you can cherish
They say the scene of me was made for lovers out in Paris
Ask a fan about me they say ""50 we love 'em""
Without them, there's no me so I love them
Man their the reason I exist, the reason I insist
I'm never less then the best so perfection I guess
That's why niggas are stress'd, I'll pass the test
Every time I drop, I'm burnin' hot
So I don't care if she loves me or loves me not
As long as I enjoy the time that we spend
I ain't lookin' for commitment, we could fuck and be friends
Matter fact we can do it right in the back of my Benz
I get it done with speed

[Chorus]",Follow My Lead,2007
Robin Thicke,"Ho

She's the kind of girl you wanna marry
The kind of girl, you'd walk the whole world for
Put her on your back and just carry
Her attitude is hotter than the earth's core

When she's around nothing else matters
Untouchable, she's got her own forcefield
Sooner or later someone will get at her
If I don't someone else will

Wanna love you, girl, wanna love you, girl
Wanna love you, girl, wanna love you
Wanna love you, girl, wanna love you, girl
Wanna love you, girl, wanna love you

Wanna love you, girl, wanna love you, girl
Wanna love you, girl, wanna love you
Wanna love you, girl, wanna love you, girl
Wanna love you, girl, wanna love you

Oh oh oh

She's the kind of girl, you wanna marry
Scientists say that she's the second sunshine
And now my life is sweeter than berries
I guess if we have sex our love will turn to wine

When she's around nothing else matters
Even if the sky was at a stand still
If I turn my back then someone will get at her
If I don't someone else will

Wanna love you, girl, wanna love you, girl
Wanna love you, girl, wanna love you

Wanna love you, girl, ooh

Uhh, picture this all
Picture my life and my intention to ball
Picture this ice and how it glitter for y'all
Now don't you feel claustrophobic when that chick is involved?

She changed your life and your frame of mind
Sorry I hope what I'm saying is fine
We fuss but we take it one day at a time
If there's a fire you know that she'll lay in the line

I just, close my eyes and curve my mouth
Open my mind and words come out
You're eclectic, you're creative
You the picture girl, I just painted

I got it, you name it, it's all paid for
Big castle on the sea shore
With the Willy Wonka decor
How this sound, Mr. and Mrs. Skateboard, P

Wanna love you, girl, wanna love you
Wanna love you, girl, wanna love you
Wanna love you, girl, wanna love you

Out of my mind into your heart, into your life

No matter what the weather, I'd learn to change,
I'd change with the time, yeah

She hold me tight, treat me right, and tell me
That everything is gonna be,
Is gonna be alright, alright

That he was loved, there's no need to cry

Robin Thicke,"We are at war
With the universe
The sky is falling
And the only thing that can save us now
Is sensitivity and compassion

But I know one thing's for sure
I'm gonna get my kicks before it all burns down

Some say tragedy is hard to get over
But some time that tragedy means its over, soldier
From the academy, league of rollers
I deny being down though they seem to hold us
My shoulders are strong, I prove them wrong
I ain't doing nothin' but movin' on, let the truth be known
But they talk that freedom matters, and didn't even leave a ladder, damn

I work at the corner store
We all got problems problems
Who was gon' fight alone
No one's gon' save us now
How you feel, you're not alone
We're all just jealous jealous
We don't reach the sky no more
We just can't overcome no

Tie my hands
What am I gonna be
What have I done so bad
What is my destiny
Tie my hands
What am I supposed to see
What have I done so bad
What am I gonna be

I, knock on the door, hope isn't home,
Fates not around, the lucks all gone
Don't ask me whats wrong, ask me whats right
And I'm a tell you whats life
And did you know?
I lost everything, but I ain't the only one
First came the hurricane, then the morning sun
Excuse me if I'm on one, and don't trip if I light one,
I walk a tight one
They try to tell me keep my eyes open
My whole city under water, some people still floatin'
Then they wonder why black people still voting,
Cause your presidents still chokin'
Take away the football team, the basketball team
Now all we got is me to represent New Orleans
No governor, no help from the mayor
Just a steady beatin' heart, and a wish and a prayer

These friends they come and go
But I got family family
These kids so fast they grow
They learn so quickly now
That there's no way to go,
That there's no future future
Don't make this seem so low
That we can't overcome

Tie my hands
What am I gonna be
What have I done so bad
What is my destiny
Tie my hands
What am I supposed to see
What have I done so bad
What am I gonna be

And if you come from under the water then there's fresh air
Just breathe baby, gods got a blessing to spare
Yes, I know the process has so much stress
But its the progress that fills the best
'Cause I came from the projects straight to success
And your next, so try they can't steal your pride its inside
Then find it and keep on grinding
'Cause in every dark cloud there's a silver lining
I know

Right now we just riding on love
A shot in the dark,
We ain't tryna do nothing be at the heart
We need love, that's all now

Number one at whatever, I get bundles of cheddar
This that black cloud you deserve wonderful weather

Never shopping in clearance, don't make me embarrassed
She never a bird, but baby my parrot
Her flavor superb, I pay her with carrots
My house is her home, I made her a palette
Maybe being too modest, my shit more like a palace
Follow the waterfalls, as it makes you wetter

This shit ain't made up, look what I'm made of
Look what I made brah, don't owe no favors
Have 700s, first one to get it
My car's a virgin, first one to hit it
Hit the rim shop, get 'em to the hood
Stop by her momma house, that's if I'm feeling good
Now I need a fifth, time to hit the strip
I'ma hit the club, I'ma buy the VIP
We spending money, I'm talking slick

From something at home, she would not say
She needed new friends, no doors would open
She had to place to stay

Then came a bird, Who knew the town
Who barely ever left the ground
They saw each other, they saw forever
They bother knew it right away

Two love birds, two love signs
You got me going out of my mind
I love you for a lifetime
You got me going out of my mind

Two love birds, two love signs
You got me going out of my mind
I love you for a lifetime
You got me going out of my mind

They had it good, not lots of style
Not lots of money, just lots of love
She started working, he learned to cook
Somehow they made their way

Then they started flying all around on their own
Up in the sky and now they're never ever home
They started fighting, then it got silent
They didn't know how to make it without each other

They're just two love birds, two love signs
You got me going out of my mind
I love you for a lifetime
You got me going out of my mind
