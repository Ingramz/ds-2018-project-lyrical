Mario Rusca,"It seems like a dream, yet I know it happened
A man, a maid, a kiss, and then goodbye
Romance was the theme
And we were the players
I never think of this without a sigh
 
Lover, one lovely day
Love came, planning to stay
Green Dolphin Street supplied the setting
The setting for nights beyond forgetting
And through these moments apart memories live in my heart
When I recall the love I found on
I could kiss the ground on Green Dolphin Street
 
Lover, one lovely day
Love came, planning to stay
Green Dolphin Street supplied the setting
The setting for nights beyond forgetting
And through these moments apart memories live in my heart
When I recall the love I found on
On Green Dolphin Street
",On Green Dolphin Street,1998
Mario Rusca Trio,"Night and stars above that shine so bright 
The myst'ry of their fading light 
That shines upon our caravan 
 
Sleep upon my shoulder as we creep 
Across the sand so I may keep 
The mem'ry of our caravan 
 
This is so exciting 
You are so inviting 
Resting in my arms 
As I thrill to the magic charms 
Of you beside me here beneath the blue 
My dream of love is coming true 
Within our desert caravan",Caravan,1997
Mario Saucedo,"Como en aquellos tiempos de nuestra juventud 
Mi corazón añora tu juventud de rosas 
Y aun sigo enamorado de ti mi linda esposa 
Ya nuestro pelo negro de blanco se vistió 
Ya nuestros hijos viven la juventud hermosa 
Yo aun sigo enamorado de ti mi linda esposa
 
Que dios te guarde para mí eternamente 
Pues me a de separar de ti solo la muerte 
Amor como este jamás a de existir 
Ya nuestro pelo negro de blanco se vistió 
Ya nuestros hijos viven la juventud hermosa 
Yo aun sigo enamorado de ti mi linda esposa
 
Yo aun sigo enamorado de ti mi linda esposa
 
Que dios te guarde para mí eternamente

Mario Saucedo,"Una moneda se le da a cualquiera 
Tomala y vete,y que tus días te ayude 
Yo nunca quise que de mi te fueras 
 
Y por tenerte hice cuanto pude 
Pero a mi ruego no le hiciste caso 
Y me dejaste por tu amor sufriendo 
Hoy que no tienes quien te de sus brazos 
 
Vas por la calle caridad pidiendo 
 
Y la gente de mal corazón 
Te desprecia y se burla de ti 
La vergüenza que te hace pasar 
Es vergüenza también para mi 
 
Me causas pena mejor te murieras 
Para que nadie juzgue tus errores 
Y así enterrarte donde yo pudiera 
Ir diariamente a dejarte flores
 
Y la gente de mal corazón 
Te desprecia y se burla de ti 
La vergüenza que te hace pasar 
Es vergüenza también para mi

Y así enterrarte donde yo pudiera 
Ir diariamente a dejarte flores",Una Moneda,1996

Mario Schiano,"It had to be you, it had to be you.
I wandered around and finally found the somebody who
Could make me be true, could make me feel blue,
And even be glad just to be sad thinkin' of you.

Some others I've seen might never be mean
Might never be cross or try to be boss,
But they wouldn't do.
For nobody else gave me a thrill.
With all your faults, I love you still,
It had to be you, wonderful you,

I could live without love
Now I must admit,

And just make up your mind
That you'll be sweet & gentle,

Mario Spiga,"A menudo me recuerdas a alguien 
Tu sonrisa la imagino sin miedo 
Invadido por la ausencia
Me demora la impaciencia 
Yo sí quiero conocerte y tú no a mí 

Ya sé todo de tu vida y sin embargo 
No conozco ni un detalle de ti 
El teléfono es muy frío 
y tus llamadas son muy cortas 
Me pregunto si algun día te veré, por favor 

Dame una cita, vamos al parque 
Entra en mi vida, sin anunciarte 
Abre la puerta y cierra los ojos 
Vamos a vernos, poquito a poco 
Dame tus manos, siente la mías 
Como dos ciegos, Santa Lucía, yeah yeah 

A menudo me recuerdas a mí 
La primera vez pensé
Se ha equivocado
La segunda vez no supe qué decir 
Las demás me daban miedo
Tanto loco que anda suelto y 
Ahora sé que no podría vivir sin ti
Por favor

Mario Stantchev,"The falling leaves drift by the window
The autumn leaves of red and gold
I see your lips, the summer kisses
The sun-burned hands I used to hold

Since you went away the days grow long
And soon I'll hear old winter's song
But I miss you most of all my darling
When autumn leaves start to fall

C'est une chanson, qui nous ressemble
Toi tu m'aimais et je t'aimais
Nous vivions tous deux ensemble
Toi qui m'aimais moi qui t'aimais
Mais la vie separe ceux qui s'aiment
Tout doucement sans faire de bruit
Et la mer efface sur le sable les pas des amants desunis",Autumn Leaves,2015
Mario Vazquez,"Whoo 
I'm a boss so I hit her with the little head game 
I can tell she like to taste sweet things 
First thing I met her for sense a switch go 
Damn I been gone too long 
She know what the business was 
I told her to get at it

Puerto Rican mix sweet tone 
Only promise she was with this cat standing six foot four
She said I ride my own (check) 
Go away (check) 
Don't worry bout it your just another pay (check) 
She said I ain't gotta ask anything I want (yet) 
I said what that's called when you move it like (that) 
She kept reiterating she had a thing for (sex) 
A man and another man she tried (yet) 
So I pulled back put it up another drink 
She like tell me what you think 
Gotta just take another puff 

[Chorus:Repeat x2]
She wanna smoke Cohiba 
You gotta work for that 
Gotta work for that 
Can I smoke your Cohiba 
You gotta work for that 
Gotta work for that 
She wanna smoke my Cohiba 
You gotta work for that 
Gotta work for that
Can I smoke your Cohiba 
You gotta work for that 
Gotta work for that

She told me not to think how could I hesitate 
Who would love the chance 
Just to give it to me 
I knew it the things I would do to her 
But I keep thinking me him and her 
But the obvious told me believe her 
Heard that she giving me the fever 
Slow up ma and kick back 
While I think about what I'm gon do with that 
She said I ride my own (check) 
Go away (check) 
Don't worry about it

Mario Vazquez,"I hear the words you speak it's clearer every time
The middle, the end, the sound of every line
But do they mean a thing when defenses are stoppin' you
From saying everything that I need you to?

Do you know what it's like when it kills, it's a crime
When the one that you want is only speaking in empty rhymes
'Cause I want you, want you, want you, I've fallen over you
So don't tell me, tell me, tell me the sun will see the moon
When I need ya, need ya, need ya you make me wait in line
Just be cool tonight, don't lie

Oh, do you remember the first time when it was you and I
When lonely days and memories erased with time
And everything in front of us was ours to lose, yeah
But somewhere along the way you had to choose

Do you know what it's like when it kills, it's a crime
You tell me you want me but I don't see you standin' by
'Cause I want you, want you, want you, I've fallen over you
So don't tell me, tell me, tell me the sun will see the moon
But I need ya, need ya, need ya you make me wait in line
Just be cool tonight, don't lie (no, no)

Yeah, I thought you could be something more like the light in my life
But these barricades they get bigger and bigger time passes by
There's a web filled with holes and I can't stop myself I keep falling through
Just say anything, right now that should do

Oh, don't leave me
When you lose it

Do you know what it's like when it's gone, it's a crime
And it's so obvious but we know the truth's not kind
But I want you, want you, want you, I've fallen over you
So don't tell me, tell me, tell me the sun will see the moon
When I need ya, need ya, need ya don't make me wait in line
Just be cool tonight, don't lie
Just be cool tonight, don't lie",Don't Lie,2006

Three times this same week you been askin' to come to my crib 
Girl you got a problem and I know what it is 
You done got a little taste of incredible that's got you out of pocketing and you don't know why 
And it should come as know surprise 
That I got something that blows your mind 

I think it's the way that I move 
The things that I do 
That's a little different 
From the things that you did 
When your not here 
And that's why your trippin' 
I bet he don't 

[Chorus]
I bet he don't give you whatcha need 
I bet he don't give you watchu want 
Said I bet, said I bet he don't do it like me 
That's why you always trying to be alone 
I bet he don't kiss ya right 
Don't miss you right 
Don't handle his like I handle mine 
I bet he can't do it like me 
No, no, no, no baby 

So don't try to fight it 
You can't hide it from me, no 
What I said, tried to fix 
Everyday, you a hit 
You can't let it go 'cause your love is so 
Now you say your not sprung and any day you'll be through 
That's why I got 
Five missed calls on my phone 
And they all come from you 

I think it's the way that I move 
The things that I do 
And that's a little different 
From the things that you did 
When your not here 
And that's why your trippin' 
I bet he can't

Let me say one thing 
I know to be true 
That he don't understand your body 
Quite like I do 
And the feeling that you get is so ridiculous 
It's hard to quit

Curly brown hair you know I'm her type

And outta this place""

Wake up this morning said to myself 
Today will be the day I'm gonna ring on his bell 
Didn't have to ring 'cause he's standing outside 
As soon as I pulled up pure hate in his eyes 
I took a deep breath said what I had to say 
He looked at me and said ""Hey, you better stay away"" 
You and her together it'll never be ok 
I looked at him and said ""Ha""

I will love you forever now
No one will do you better now
Love is a risk but if you give me one shot,
I will show you you're the only girl in the world who can give me this feeling
Baby that's how I feel about you
(You're one in a million)
I rather die than live without you
We can't miss so if you give me one shot
We can do it girl (do it girl)

I'm talking about love in the morning
Just like you want it
Anything you need you can call me for it

Now girl I'm only human, I'm full of many faults
I'm guaranteed to fall short
But you'll never hear about me cheating 'cause I never would betray your trust no matter what
I will look to you and only you for love
I treat your soul like it was mine
What a privilege to me to be breathe you're air
Doesn't that say that I care

[Chorus]

I'm talking about all my heart 
All my soul always say never go

But unfortunately all I have to give to you is an imperfect heart, 
But its a heart that beats only for you

[Chorus]

I'm talking everyday, every night
The rest of you're days, the rest of you're life

So much ice his neck and wrist froze
Is he faithful to her? Hell no
But she chose to be with him, shorty

Tell me what's the reason that you hold on

But his money's hard to ignore

After he's done dulling your shine

Venuti male
La tangenziale
La ferrovia
Le notti insonni
Girando in auto
Per la sacra periferia
Storie di Corviale
Di Quarto Oggiaro
Di Scampia
Di Librino e Zen
Sono conficcate come pugnali
Nel ventre della città

Tu mi hai raccontato
Che rubavi rame
Che ti ha beccato la polizia
Che sei già sposato
Con una bambina
Con la cocaina
Vivi a casa sua
Ti giuro amore
Non la tocco più
La polverina che dicevi tu
A volume alto
Dalle autoradio
Nel ventre della città

Ci incontreremo le sere d'estate
Sul mare d'asfalto di queste borgate
Non sarà male fermarsi a guardare
Le nostre ferite
Le stelle inventate

C'è chi dorme male
Sogna di scappare
Dai discreti letti della borghesia
C'è chi non la legge
Solo dentro i libri
La cerca altrove la poesia
Meglio l'animale
Che ti mostra il cuore
Nella comunione
Di una botta e via
Tu lo puoi trovare
Dove Cristo muore
Nel ventre della città

Mario Winans,"I've seen a lot of things in my life
A lot of ups and downs
Made a lot of mistakes
No matter what, you've always been by my side
You've always been my best friend

You're the love of my life
You're everything to me
You never left my side
You're my best friend
I love you so much
Yes, you are
You're my best friend

Since the beginning of time
All you did was bless men
Too young to understand but now you my best friend
How could they doubt you, never think about you
Don't they know nothing's possible without you

Faith without fear that's how they raised me
Words of man kill but never phase me
Grateful for wisdom that you gave me
But still I'm like, dear God I wonder, could you save me?

Too much sinning, gotta be more than plush living
Gotta be more than grabbing nines to buck tin in
Gotta be more than just to lust women
Gotta be more than platinum Rolexes, 600's and crushed linen

Praise your name, I know some of them hate their due
Judgment day, don't they know they can't escape your crew
I'm just trying to live right and pray you take me through
And with this song I dedicate to you, my Lord

Lord, you mean the world to me
Before I was born you chose me
You always hear me when I'm calling
Even catch me when I'm falling

You're the closest one to me
I surrender all to thee
I want the whole wide world to see
That we've always been and we'll always be
Best friends

Sometimes I reminisce and wonder how I made it this far
Because of you, I'm me, so you the real star
Your hindsight, the time's right to get my mind tight
Then give it to you and let it shine bright

My best friend, only know how to teach the truth
Plant the seeds of life and let them eat the fruit
Can't you see that He spread love for you
Shed blood for you, cry for and die for you

Willies with mac millies know how you get down
We know the drama you bring whenever you hit town
Just remember when you pray, God is love
Gracious, merciful, forgive even the hardest thugs

Life as we know it, it all begins with Him
Life as we know it, it all ends with Him
If I was you I would never try to pretend with Him
He might spaz and blow it, I'm best friends with him

Lord, you mean the world to me
Before I was born you chose me
You always hear me when I'm calling
Even catch me when I'm falling

You're the closest one to me
I surrender all to thee
I want the whole wide world to see
That we've always been and we'll always be
Best friends

Been two and a half years since my man Big passed
Been two and a half years since my world crashed
I needed help, God gave me the power
Gave me the strength to go face to face with my darkest hour

Looked me in the eyes and ask, ""What you doing unhappy?""
""Don't you know why I'm here?"" and started shooting at me
Back to the wall, is my faith gonna play out
Never wavered once, gave me no way out

Your time to die, don't even stress the date
You're coming with me, your soul I'm next to take
I told him, ""I'm too much blessed with faith""
""And living for Christ"" and then he said, ""Manifest the great""

All of a sudden, what I'm remembering
Ground started to shake, everything trembling
The power of the truth was shooting through my Timberlands
Here was my Lord Jesus Christ, my best friend again, come on

Lord, you mean the world to me
Before I was born you chose me
You always hear me when I'm calling
Even catch me when I'm falling

You're the closest one to me
I surrender all to thee

Startin' to feel this
Startin' to feel it

[Black Rob]
Yo, who these cats think they is takin' they biz that's round here? 
Yo, dog, don't even go there
This is ours; we built this from the ground on up
Now it's flowers; I think you best a round on up
Your entourage - slim chance of y'all gettin' large
It's non-cipher; that's because B.R.'s in charge
It's set here; cats is known for gettin' wet here
And left here, till the cops come pick us up

[Mark Curry]
Step in a territory that's corrupt, pushin' your luck
Intrudin' wishes is already sowed up; n**** fold up
You and your crew and peoples will get slain
This ain't the place to try and gain fame from
You gets burnt in the streets a n**** worked hard to make
And I'll be damned if I let another brother take it
Alive for his own sake; they better vacate
Promptly, 'fore they get they a** stomped
Listen, take heed to what we sayin', n****s

[Chorus]
We won't lie; sometimes we stick 'em up
Last time, it was enough, though word life some hos did 'em up
And nine glocks set 'em up
I know it was your dough 'cause I was right there when they split it up
I could tell you where to find the corpse
But that cheddar - I'm afraid, dog, that's gone forever

[Mark Curry]
Greed for wealth got us stingy
We got a spot that's hot
N****s envy the fact that we clock mad dough
They want to see us shut down, but, no
I don't think so; the crew is still rakin' the cash flow
For every dime bag sold on this block, we want in
One slug behind the back; it's under the skin
When n****s try to step to the block and Bogard
We can't see it happenin'
Warn them first; get the f*** out of dodge
Better believe that; test it
See if we won't put you on your back, n****s

[Chorus]

[Black Rob]
Now bein' that it's all out war
I'm bringin' more than that four-by-four
Watch me dispose of all y'all
Y'all fraud a** n****s
Tape me reboard a** n****s
Gun bigger than sword a** n****s
Now enter in the ring, gun drawn, makin' moves like pawns
Two at a time, comin' for mine
Like a song, n****, CBS, he can't be serious finesse
He don't believe I keep a gun in the vest

[Mark Curry]
You think you can disgrace this empire we built from scratch?
You stupid; I wouldn't care how ruthless your crew is
We got defense on this area; try to attack
Mad n****s on the barriers that's dyin' of blast back
There be no givin' and no takin', definitely no breakin'
Laws we lay down; here's the situation
Severe torture is what those who don't feel us face
I show no love for a punk-a** n**** we hate
Try to pay me no bribe, then come up missin'
Happens to hard-headed n****s when they don't listen
I gave you fair warnin' 'bout the danger you're messin' with
A stranger invadin' the street corners are goners
Try me, if you think it's a lie, the attitude many n****s had
But in the process many die
Thinkin' they can step to the block and Bogard
And couldn't see it happenin'
Warned 'em first: get the f*** outta dodge

At first we were friends then became lovers
You was more than my girl we was like brothers
On late nights we would play fight under covers
Now you gone can't love you like I really want to
But every time I think about your pretty smile
And how we used to drive the whole city wild
Damn I wish you would have had my child
A pretty little girl with Diddy style

Ooh yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
Oh baby

[Benzino]:
I remember when we had to keep it on the low
Flew you everywhere so nobody would know
And I remember when we got stuck in the storm one night
(remember that) pulled over hopped out had a snowball fight
I remember havin so much fun
Like fuckin on the beach waitin for the sun
I understand when they say love hurts
So let's get it like we had it and make this love work
Mario

[Chorus [Mario Winans]:]
Yeah oh I remember when we started this star
Hey girl you know that we belong together
So glad admit to mine forever
And love no matter what you'll never give it up

[Benzino]:
We used to shit like catch a flick
Sit back in the roll hug and kiss
We used to pillow fight always makin a mess
Everything's so right never feeling stress
We used to walk the mall shop all day
We used to watch movies at the crib all day
We used to talk it out instead of throwin things
We used to pass jacob's to steam the rings
Bumpin brandy on repeat it's revealed to me
You my angel in disguise and it's real to me
Now it's clear to see it's on destiny
So let's get this back how it's suppose to be
My love

[Chorus]
Baby I know we can make it happen
First let's get it back to where it started
Baby

[Benzino]:
I thought you said I had a special place in your heart
I thought nothin in the world would tear us apart
You always said you understood what I did
I told you from the start I had to handle my biz
I can't believe you want to act this way
After all we've been through you want to throw it away
See I'm forever yours I gotta make it happen
And I just want to get it back to",I Remember,2002

Would you love me if I fell on hard times?
Lost everything, down to a dime?
Would you, let me fuck if I didn't stack cheese?
Didn't see my face on BET?

Would you, stop for me, if I wasn't on dubs?
Didn't buy the bar when I walk through the club?
Would you, let me slide if I wasn't so live?
Average joe working nine to five?

Would you still want to ride? 
Still want to freak if the ice wasn't bright in the masterpiece?
If you didn't lose sight when I flashed the three
Would you still be shakin that ass for me?

Would you, creek, let me run in it?
Kiss the first night, take it to the limit?
If I had to go to jail would you hold it down?
If not, shit I'ma leave ya now, I need to know

[Chorus: Mario Winans w/ ad libs]
I gotta know, baby
Would you be right here beside me when I'm gone

Oh tell me 'cause I gotta know

Don diva, first name Lisa

If I was broke would you still want to marry?
If I wasn't on the screen, would you still fiend?
And would I still be your dream? 
If I didn't gleam on my own 

Would you still be in that zone?
Would you never leave me alone?
If I was a Reebok hood rat would you still book that flight 
Outta town, if I didn't stay laced? 

Couldn't cook would you still be in my life?
Now, Made Men, act like ya know then

Yellow Man, Yellow City, here we go again

Build a love that a last forever

Roll through rough, I got the range
Ma I got some thangs, knowned to put rocks in rings
Push a hundred foot yachts and thangs

Or seened a brotha play a Mandalay?

No more lies, no more tears to cry
No more reasons for leavin', do I believe in?

[Verse - Guerilla Black]
I remember when I met you on Crenshaw
I almost crashed my truck, and spilled my Hen' dawg
Yes you, God blessed you, I was trying to get next to you
Your homegirls was hating, but I didn't care
You said you had a man, I was like ""where?""
It was something so different about you
I felt so gifted around you
Even though you had a man and all
I took the chance to call, we held hands at the mall
That day was so special to me
Your man left you at Mickey D's
You called me, I scooped you up
I seen fear in your eyes, the tears in your eyes
He can't hug you like I hug you
Better yet love you like this thug do

[Chorus - Mario Winans]
You're so special, you're the one
But you're already ta-ken
Oh I can't help the way I'm feeling
You're the one, I wish I could replace him
Cause I know that baby you're the one

[Verse - Guerilla Black]
I'm having the time of my life
Felt the world on wheels, you and your homegirl got some skills
Nobody make me feel like you do
Or better yet real like you, I messed around and killed dude
I seen homegirly just flossin, we made eye contact
Dude always is flossin, me never
You and be	-l-a-see-k forever, tattered on my neck in green letters
Late night eating Häagen-Dazs, watching Uncut
And me sitting there, playing wit your butt
Took off your clothes, I hit it on the counch
Even though mom's in the house
Nothing could replace this feeling
It's like winning 2 million, our bond closer than Cicilians
I know old boy won't leave you alone
I know you love him, but our love is strong

[Chorus]

[Verse - Guerilla Black]
I couldn't leave well enough alone
Hell I had to hit ya cell phone
I left you a message, it went like this, ""I love you, mmmuah!""
I guess it's my luck, I goes to the Magic
Damn, ain't that his truck?
I guess you wit him, screw him
If it wasn't for you, I'd have to do him
You seen 'em at Jack In The Box
He was mackin a lot, to some rats in a drop
Now you call The Beat and The Power, dedicate songs every hour
All hell done broke loose
He got your passcode to your cell and my Nextel shirt too
I guess it's time for you to decide
Which one of us you want in your ride?

Girl out of time, girl out of time
I was lovin' you baby

Every little thing you said
didn't come from your heart
Now I'm laying out in my bed
Wondering what we are
Cause you never meant what you said
And you throw it all on my head
You made me believe, that you wanted me
You could've told the truth instead, baby

I don't know why 
Didn't realize
You took the time to pick me up
And let me down baby
Look in my eyes, you can't deny
That your the reason for the pain I feel inside

When I looked into your eyes
There was nothing I can see
Now I'm lost and can't find my way
Cause love has blinded me and Now 
I don't know what to do, nothing that have to prove
You played me for a fool, all the time I was lovin' you

Now the things were going
I knew I should've left back then
But my heart was steadily growing
Blaming, all the man I am
If you felt this way 
You should've showed it
You shouldn't ever took so long
Made it cleared, that you don't care
Where did I go wrong, baby?

But there's no time.

The day before I was gone like any other day
3 days ago I wrote this song just for you
Will I ever get ahead through to you

Ran wit big dudes, had to get my weight up

Now I made it, and all y'all niggaz can hate it

Knowing that I came from the basement

Used to live in Reno but we met on the beach
Sang bars from the star, everythang was peace
Then we got our shit together, you moved in the castle
Let you shop wit the Capital One, no hassles
One minute you're cool, next minute you're amped
Talking loud trying to play me like a wet food stamp
Ho!! Think of me in your life with the next dude
I'm like Chef, I'm contemplating my next move
Then think of all the wankstas I hit
Ain't this a bitch? shit this is all the thanks I get?
I'm gone

That you can walk away, from my love

Down on my knees to pray
That you would turn around and be my baby

All the moments that we shared
You could never put a price on us
I tried to trust in you
After all of this how dare
You say that you are leavin'

But she right here in my face,take her to a fly place,
With a fly fireplace,no marshmallows, 
We let the dro burn, I dun seen the world, 
Girl its you're turn,I told you lies all my life,
But you hold me down wrong or right, 
So its only right she get that Porsche truck, 
All black black rims call her Porsche,
Let you're weave blow in the wind, 'cause believe every d boy need a friend

If you ever been in love you would know what I mean yeah

But trying to ignore cause I don't wanna fight
I know I make mistakes
But still I need her in my life

Because of you

Mario Winans,"There's times in my life where I just
I just wanna run away, I just
I just wish the pain would stop
I don't wanna cry no more
I wish the pain would go away

Start a day, bad hands make it hard to deal
Sometimes I wanna pull it, end it all with a bullet
Hard to live life to the fullest with all this bullshit
Mad as fuck, a nigga had enough
From jump street, saw my father murder massacre slain
One shot took half of his brain, I recapture the pain
Twenty-three years, three when it happened
Twenty-six now, still I can't stop the tears
Then my mood switch, thinkin' about this sheisty bitch
Kinda funny cause they fake it when they callin' you honey
On your dick when they think a nigga, might be rich
That's when I shit, cause I know you fuck with me for my money
Learned the hard way, ain't no correctin' the grief
Baby moms starts sexin', my so-called beef
Don't give a fuck if they Marked me For Death like Steven
Or relievin' your breathin', long as I'm even 'fore I'm leavin'
Pain

I wish this pain, would go away
We're talkin about the kind of pain that
I wish this pain, would go away
Just gets all up in your heart, and in your soul
I wish this pain, would go away
The kind of pain that makes you feel like you can't go on no more
I wish this pain, would go away
The kind of pain that I wouldn't wish on anyone

I can't relate to them cats who hold gats at the gate
Is it my fate, am I that nigga, that they love to hate
Solely, slowly, cause I rock a Roley they want my brain gone
Cause of a fuckin' chain on?
Migraine's on, now the pain's warm, I stagger
And I'm hopin' I don't know the cat with the dagger
Penetratin' my heart, rushed thoughts etched in grief
To the City College deceased may you rest in peace
To the families, I never meant to cause no pain
I know the truth, but if you want, then I shoulder the blame
Overcome at times by uncontrollable flames, and multiple pains
Now it seems like I'm goin insane
For the love of you and hip-hop I expand the news
But before my shit drops, I stand accused
Don't you think I wish we all was rich?
One for all it's pain to see your people when they all can't ball
The pain..

I wish this pain, would go away
I wish this pain, would go away
I don't wanna give no more pain
I wish this pain, would go away
I don't wanna receive no more pain
I wish this pain, would go away

Don't let him die, please don't let my nigga be dead""
But it was too late, California sealed his fate
Gone now, hard to move on now, fuck making songs now
Wish I could die, I could fly
If they don't give a fuck, fuck it why should I?
That's when Big spoke, pulled up in a glistening three
With platinum wings and said, ""Puff listen to me""
He puts his hands on my head and said ""I live through you
Make hits continuous, this is what we do
I know it might be strenuous and times is hard
Just keep the faith cause now we rhyme with God
Plus you owe it to yourself and don't forget the kids""
That's when I opened up my eyes and new Bad Boy lives

I wish this pain, would go away
I wish this pain, would go away
One day the pain is gonna stop
I wish this pain, would go away
One day there's gonna be no more pain
I wish this pain, would go away

I'm tellin' you man
Now don't let these motherfuckers fuck your shit up God
I don't give a fuck who it is
Don't let em fuck yo' paper man, please Big
Focus your mind man, do your albums, make them hot joints
Man fuck these niggaz man
Fuck these niggaz man
And I'ma tell the same thing to you
When you get your shit done, watch your money, and
Hopefully, I pray for you, you be the shit
And soon motherfuckers start screamin' your name out
Like they screamin' all these other, so-called hot niggas
Never take your eyes off that shit yo
Try to get everything you can out of these motherfuckers yo
Ain't no guarantee they gonna love you next year

I wish this pain, would go away
I wish this pain, would go away
One day the pain is gonna stop
I wish this pain, would go away
One day there's gonna be no more pain
I wish this pain, would go away
One day the pain is gonna stop
I wish this pain, would go away
One day there's gonna be no more pain",The Pain,2007

Intro:

It?s Mario Winans, and Massiv
It?s like a dream?

(Part 1,Massiv):

Hand auf?s Herz das war Liebe auf den ersten Blick
Ich wusste nicht dass man durch Sehnsucht solche krassen Schmerzen kriegt
Würd? dir gern beweisen das mein Herz allein nur dir gehört
Wär? ich taub geboren dann würd? ich dich mein Engel flüsstern hören
Nur für dich! Würd? ich mein Leben lang I'm Regen stehen
Glaub mir nur für dich würd? ich mich barfuss durch die Scherben quälen
Ich schenk dir Ehrlichkeit, Vertrauen und Geborgenheit
Den sanften Klang der Liebe kannste hören wenn do dein Leben teilst
Ich war nie der Typ der viel Gefühle zeigt
Doch die Angst dich zu verlieren zerbricht mein Herz in 100.000 Einzelteile
Guck ich wein?, während ich dir diese Zeilen schreib?
Und hoff? das hält bis in die Ewigkeit
Ich war der Typ der dort I'm Regen stand
Hey Engel kannst do dich erinnern do bist einfach in den Bus gegangen?!
Also stand ich dort am Strassenrand
Doch mein Herz war längst bei dir I'm Bus und fuhr mit dir die Strassen lang

Refrain,Mario Winans:

This is like a dream to me
The beauty in your face I see
And all I wish is that you?ll be
The woman next to me

And I will cherish every day
I?ll show you love in every way
Baby this is meant to be
And it?s like a dream to me

(Part 2,Massiv):

Wie ?ne Prinzessin setz? ich dich auf den Thron
Ich werd? dich mit den frisch geschnittenen Rosen morgens belohnen
Fahren mit ?ner Kutsche über ?n Schausollisee
Selbst wenn wir auf dem Lande picknicken sorg? ich dafür dass Kerzen da stehen
Ich deck dich zu wenn do dich schlafen legst
Hey do kannst dich kuschelnd an mich lehnen und mich mit in deinen Traum mitnehmen
Guck ich verehre dich und man do bist so zuckersüss
Ich begehre dich, ich bin kein Mann der seine Frau betrügt
Ich hetze jeden Tag mit dir als ob?s der letzte wär?
Hier steht ?n Mann der seine Frau verehrt
Ich umarm dich wenn der Regen fällt
Ich beschütz? dich unter ?m Schirm von dieser oberflächlich kalten Welt
Ich weiss genau als ich dich das erste mal sah
Sie hat mich nicht beachtet doch sie merkte dass es mich traf
Seit jenem Tag zog mich die Liebe in ihren Bann
Denn mein Herz war längst bei ihr I'm Bus und fuhr mit ihr die Strassen lang

Refrain,Mario Winans:

This is like a dream to me
The beauty in your face I see
And all I wish is that you?ll be
The woman next to me

And I will cherish every day
I?ll show you love in every way
Baby this is meant to be
And it?s like a dream to me

(Part 3,Masiv):

Selbst wenn do bei mir bist vermiss ich dich
Wenn do nicht in meiner Nähe bist, zerfrisst es mich innerlich
Ich glaub nicht daran dass das ?n Märchen ist
Das hier ist das wahre Leben doch ich hoff? do siehst mich als dein Märchenprinz
Ich hoff? do fährst nie wieder mit dem Bus an mir vorbei
Denn dann steh ich wieder ganz allein
Dort I'm Regen wo ich öfters stand
Wo das Regenwasser fliesst und das ganze Laub mit dir vom Strassenrand

Refrain,Mario Winans:

This is like a dream to me
The beauty in your face I see
And all I wish is that you?ll be
The woman next to me

And I will cherish every day
I?ll show you love in every way
Baby this is meant to be
And it?s like a dream to me

Mario Winans,"I need a girl, in my life
Who's beautiful enough to all my soul
They someone I can go
I need a girl, in my life
I excited that it something you should know
That I never let you go
I need a girl

Eine frau die mich liebt, selbst wenn ich nichts mehr hab
Aber hast du was bist du was
Die meisten frauen sind auf geld aus
Handtasche lv
Schatz ich hätt' gern das kleid von cavalli uh
Und dazu noch diesen bally schuh
Genug ich brauch' keine famebitch
Fake chicks mit botox und facelift
Ich brauch ein mädchen mit hoodie und chucks, yes
Die, die anrufe in der nacht schätzt
Die immer für mich da ist
Bei der selbst meine mum sagt sympathisch - die mag ich
Eine frau die mich niemals enttäuscht
Und keine diva die träumt doch ich gib nicht auf
Sags mir wo find ich dich ha

I excited that it something you should know
That I never let you go
I need a girl

Und kein papagei der mich nachplappert
Sie will kein schampus, sie hätt' gern ein glas wasser
Denn sie braucht das nicht - sich prevellieren
Kein shake hands - haute coutoure
Sie macht sich nicht für die disco schick
Sie macht sich hübsch für mich
Ein flittchen ist nicht interessant für mich
Sie kommen so schnell an wenn der anzug sitzt
Arrogante chicks die auf high class tun
Fühlen sich mit nem scheiß sekt cool
One-night-stands ich will keinen drauf machen
Ich will jeden tag neben ihr aufwachen
Lachen - und wir leihen uns nen film
Einfach freitags mal chillen
Handy auf lautlos ich bin mit meinem baby

Marion,"Again you feel yourself
Curling up to a ball
In a state and accepted
But it's you they'll scrape off the floor
From speaking minds
To prising thighs
Of all the people that seem ok
Maybe you've learned
That happiness
Is only an acquired taste

But you wish you were
Wish you were
Wish you were
Wish you were
Wish you were
Wish you were
Wish you were
Wish you were
Minus you

Why do you feel that its too late
Lift yourself out of this cycle
Of their abuse and their mind games
Though confused minds
Can open thighs
And all these people can seem alright
Maybe you've learned that your
Loneliness against your happiness
Will suffice

But you wish you were
Wish you were

Marion,"Some may say
That's it's the only way
And I can honestly say
The only way
I've done it another way
I sat here yesterday
And it was the same as the day before
And I'll probably do it again
Don't give yourself away, away
It's the only way
It's the only way
It's the only way
And even though statistics say
There is only one way
I'll be there tomorrow
Soon you walk down

Marion,"Pardon me boy, is that the Chattanooga Choo Choo?
Track twenty nine, boy you can gimme a shine
I can afford to board a Chattanooga Choo Choo
I've got my fare and just a trifle to spare
 
You leave the Pennsylvania station 'bout a quarter to four
Read a magazine and then you're in Baltimore
Dinner in the diner, nothing could be finer
Than to have your ham 'n' eggs in Carolina
 
When you hear the whistle blowin' eight to the bar
Then you know that Tennessee is not very far
Shovel all the coal in, gotta keep it rollin'
Woo, woo, Chattanooga, there you are
 
There's gonna be a certain party at the station
Satin and lace, I used to call funny face
She's gonna cry until I tell her that I'll never roam",Chattanooga Choo Choo,1995
Marion,"We're drunk and night-time vision is going thin
You stumble across the body defining it
And feeling the carefree beauty of all
All the things that you value you want to take on more
The collector will collect you
Love for her is just another
But as your worlds become more twisted and involved
You find its only you that's bleeding with no-one to hold
You are frustrated, an unfortunate ring with anxiety
You would kill to be the main lover
And it's nearly complete
The collector, collector
Love for her, your just another

Marion,"There sits a little girl
And she can not handle
The pain of this world
I wonder when she'll move on
and I wonder if she'll just run
Leaving family men, violent men
She's running from men, running
I didn't want to get in a fight
But it's already on your roster tonight
I'm clinging on to your clothes
And to feel your leather and to smell your leather
The feeling of power is yours not mine
I've seen this happen a million times
Why don't you stop when you see me cry
Can you carry on with tears in my eyes
Left behind
On the floor
And I really want to stay here
From the sight that I just saw
I didn't really see you at all
Because the girl in front of me was myself when I was small
And now she's running from men, run, run
I didn't want to get in a fight
But it's already on your roster tonight
I'm clinging on to your clothes
have to feel your leather and to smell your leather
The feeling of power is yours not mine
I've seen this happen a billion times
And all your hands just cheer
When I'm as white as a sheet with fear
There she lies
And there she will deprive
Herself from being a family man, a violent men
Because a family man, a violent men
She's running from men
She is gonna run, run from men",Violent Men,1995
Marion,"You're sitting in a smokey room
You're doing what you do
Waiting for someone, waiting for no-one
You think about going out
But the pubs would have closed by now
Not that there's anyone that you would know anyway
You can't say those last words
Alone but so strong
But tell me how long can you go on with just songs
Tomorrow when we realise
Why the gift of our eyes
What am I feeling and who am I missing
As the same head storm goes on
While the thick grey clouds follow your life down
You're not in the frame of mind
It's easier going down
It's you, yourself are the only one who could take it away

You're sitting in an empty room
You're stopped doing what you do
Waiting to come down so you can go out
You decide to get going out
'Cause the people could all free out
And your mind's made up, you're going to get out
You can't say those last words
Alone but so strong
But tell me how long is it gonna go on
Tomorrow when we arise
Wipe the venom from your eyes
What am I feeling and who am I missing
As the same head storm goes out
And thick grey clouds follow your life down
You're not in the frame of mind
And it's easier going down
You know you are the only one who can take it away

Everybody has their downs
If you think about it now
They don't mean to hurt you
It's just the way that you see them",Waiting for No-One,1995

Stuck at the same point
All you do is sulk

On every trend

You're here to walk off

Start, move, your luck's in
I can here it, I'm seeing one thing

I'm not and I've not been fair
To grind down and find out
All that you were

But you've not, you've not been there
All the times I've called out
I'm looking elsewhere

Well, I tried to get inside her
As she gazed up at the sun
Said she knows of an alternative way

With our miles stretched out behind her
Now she's looking at me
Then she blew all my ideas away

She said, ""Stop, you're thinking too much
And not doing enough, your head is too full
Your making me uneasy
'cause I have to think stirring it up""

Is the feeling of hate

Even though I, even though I know
Even though I
Know everything I need to know about you
You still hideaway

I watch the birds as they fly away
And you do too
I watch you searching for gain for yourself
Minds are cruel

Losers', heaven will be coming up soon
Turns it's ugly head and looks at you
There's some things that you just have to see
Follow me

Even though I
Know everything there is to know about you

Warm, warm were your lips
Out there, on that ski trail
Where your kiss filled me with thrills

Was the most I bargained for
And then I discovered you and in your eyes

An airline ticket to romantic places

Those stumbling words that told you what my heart meant
A fair ground's painted swings

A telephone that rings but who's to answer?

First daffodils and long excited cables
And candle lights on little corner tables
And still my heart has wings

The ""Ile de France"" with all the gulls around it
The beauty that is Spring's
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The sigh of midnight trains in empty stations
Silk stockings thrown aside dance invitations
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

Gardenia perfume ling'ring on a pillow
Wild strawb'ries only seven francs a kilo
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
The smile of Garbo and the scent of roses
The waiters whistling as the last bar closes
The song that Crosby sings
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me

Marion Cotillard,"Not since Charlie Chaplin
Has there ever been a film Director
Like this

Mrs. Comtini, is there any truth to the rumor
That your marriage is in jeopardy?

None whatsoever.

My husband makes movies.
To make them he lives a kind of dream
In which his actions aren't always 
What they seem.
He may be on to some unique romantic
Theme.
Some men catch fish, some men tie 
Flies, 
Some earn their living baking bread.
My husband, he goes a little crazy
Making movies instead.

My husband spins fantasies,
He lives them, then gives them to you
All.
When he was working on the film on 
Ancient Rome,
He made the slave girls take the 
Gladiators home.
Some men buy stocks, some men punch
Clocks,
Some leap where others dare to tread.
My husband as author and director,
Makes up stories in his head.

Guido Contini, Luisa Contini,
Number one genius and number one fan,
Guido Contini, Luisa Contini,
Daughter of well-to-do Florentine
Clan,
Long ago, twenty years ago,
Once the names were Guido Contini,
Luisa Del Forno,
Actress with dreams and a life of her
Own,
Passionate, wild and in love on Livorno,
Singing with Guido all night on the 
Phone.
Long ago, someone else ago, how he 
Needs me so,
And he'll be the last to know it.

My husband makes movies.
To make them, he makes himself
Obsessed.
He goes for weeks on end without a 
Bit of rest,
No other way can he achieve his level
Best.

Some men read books, some shine their shoes,
Some retire early when they've seen
The evening news.
My husband only rarely comes to bed,
My husband makes movies instead,
My husband, makes movies

Thank you very much, Mrs. Contini.",My Husband Makes Movies,2009

But my goodness me, it's a great big world.

Is there a meadow in the mist
Where someone's waiting to be kissed?

Skylark, have you seen a valley green with spring
Where my heart can go journeying?
Over the shadows and the rain
To a blossom-covered lane?

And in your lonely flight
Haven't you heard the music of the night?
Wonderful music, faint as a will-o-the-wisp, crazy as a loon
Sad as a gypsy serenading the moon, oh

Skylark, I don't know if you can find these things
But my heart is riding on your wings
So if you see them anywhere
Won't you lead me there?

Walking uptown
With the rain in the snow
When I saw you
It came without a warning
A face I had never seen
A feeling I had never known

Moving slow in the early morning
Making love in the quiet of the day
The world was waiting to take us to a new place
We knew that we were changing
We knew that we would never be the same

I know
I would do it all over again
At the end of the day
When we are alone
I get that feeling when I see your face
And I know
You'll be there at the end of the day

Two years later we are living together
We built our dream house on a hill by the sea
We could see the shadows that were growing in the distance
We were hiding
We were blind to what we did not want to see

I know
I would do it all over again
At the end of the day
When we are alone
I get that feeling when I see your face
And I know
We will be together

5 years gone by, we have turned into strangers
We never talk since you went away
Now I find myself walking in circles
I keep looking for you everywhere
Keep waiting for the end of the day

I know
I would do it all again
At the end of the day
When I'm all alone
I get a feeling that I can't explain
If I knew then what I know now
Wouldn't change a thing, if I could somehow
I would do it all over
Over and over again
I hope and I pray
We can do it all over again

And I can't remember where or when or how
And I banished every memory you and Ia had ever made

But when you touch me like this
And you hold me like that
I just have to admit
That it's all coming back to me
When I touch you like this
And I hold you like that
It's so hard to believe but
It's all coming back to me
(It's all coming back, it's all coming back to me now)

There were moments of gold
And there were flashes of light
There were things I'd never do again
But then they'd always seemed right
There were nights of endless pleasure
It was more than any laws allow
Baby Baby

If I kiss you like this
And if you whisper like that
It was lost long ago
But it's all coming back to me
If you want me like this
And if you need me like that
It was dead long ago
But it's all coming back to me
It's so hard to resist
And it's all coming back to me
I can barely recall
But it's all coming back to me now
But it's all coming back

There were those empty threats and hollow lies
And whenever you tried to hurt me
I just hurt you even worse
And so much deeper

There were hours that just went on for days
When alone at last we'd count up all the chances
That were lost to us forever

But you were history with the slamming of the door
And I made myself so strong again somehow
And I never wasted any of my time on you since then

But if I touch you like this
And if you kiss me like that
It was so long ago
But it's all coming back to me
If you touch me like this
And if I kiss you like that
It was gone with the wind
But it's all coming back to me
(It's all coming back, it's all coming back to me now)

There were moments of gold
And there were flashes of light

When you touch me like this
And when you hold me like that
It was gone with the wind
But it's all coming back to me
When you see me like this
And when I see you like that
Then we see what we want to see
All coming back to me
The flesh and the fantasies
All coming back to me
I can barely recall
But it's all coming back to me now

If you forgive me all this
If I forgive you all that
We forgive and forget
And it's all coming back to me
When you see me like this
And when I see you like that
We see just what we want to see
All coming back to me
The flesh and the fantasies
All coming back to me
I can barely recall but it's all coming back to me now

I need to laugh with somebody and hear them laughing back
I need to share all I got and put a couple more trains on this ol' track

She was looking for a helping hand, a man to change a tire

Then quicker than a Richard Petty pit stop, I got down on one knee and said

I need to laugh with somebody and hear them laughing back
I need to share all I got and put a couple more trains on this ol' track

Ich geh heute aus, hab ich mir gedacht
Und mein Herz das sehnt, sehnt sich so nach Liebe
Plötzlich steht er da und sagt leise Hallo
Schaut mir in die Augen, ja ganz einfach so
Und ich spüre nur, diese Gefühle

1000 Fantasien durchlebe ich in meinen Gedanken
Es ist wie Magie, doch heute Nacht passiert es nie

Flieg, flieg, flieg nicht so nah ans Licht
Träume sie verbrennen, wenn ein Flügel bricht

Flieg, flieg, flieg nicht so nah ans Licht
Engel fallen tief, wenn ihr Herz zerbricht

Er nimmt meine Hand, mir wird kalt und heiß
In mir brennt ein Feuer doch ich weiß
Ich will einfach mehr, ich will wahre Gefühle
Dann der erste Kuss, draußen wird es schon hell
Ich bin wie verzaubert, doch das geht mir zu schnell
Und mein Herz es warnt mich vor diesen Gefühle

Mariona,"Can you hear the drums Fernando?
I remember long ago another starry night like this
In the firelight Fernando
You were humming to yourself and softly strumming your guitar
I could hear the distant drums
And sounds of bugle calls were coming from afar

They were closer now Fernando
Every hour every minute seemed to last eternally
I was so afraid Fernando
We were young and full of life and none of us prepared to die
And I'm not ashamed to say
The roar of guns and cannons almost made me cry

There was something in the air that night
The stars were bright, Fernando
They were shining there for you and me
For liberty, Fernando
Though I never thought that we could lose
There's no regret
If I had to do the same again
I would, my friend, Fernando
If I had to do the same again
I would, my friend, Fernando

Now we're old and grey Fernando
And since many years I haven't seen a rifle in your hand
Can you hear the drums Fernando?
Do you still recall the frightful night we crossed the Rio Grande?
I can see it in your eyes
How proud you were to fight for freedom in this land

There was something in the air that night
The stars were bright, Fernando
They were shining there for you and me
For liberty, Fernando
Though I never thought that we could lose
There's no regret
If I had to do the same again
I would, my friend, Fernando

There was something in the air that night
The stars were bright, Fernando
They were shining there for you and me

Mariona Font,"Volver a los diecisiete
Después de vivir un siglo
Es como descifrar signos
Sin ser sabio competente
Volver a ser de repente
Tan frágil como un segundo
Volver a sentir profundo
Como un niño frente a Dios
Eso es lo que siento yo
En este instante fecundo

Se va enredando, enredando
Como en el muro la hiedra
Y va brotando, brotando
Como el musguito en la piedra
Ay sí sí sí

Mi paso retrocedido
Cuando el de ustedes avanza
El arco de las alianzas
Ha penetrado en mi nido
Con todo su colorido
Se ha paseado por mis venas
Y hasta las duras cadenas
Con que nos ata el destino
Es como un diamante fino
Que alumbra mi alma serena

Lo que puede el sentimiento
No lo ha podido el saber
Ni el más claro proceder
Ni el más ancho pensamiento
Todo lo cambia el momento
Cual mago condescendiente
Nos aleja dulcemente
De rencores y violencias
Solo el amor con su ciencia
Nos vuelve tan inocentes

El amor es torbellino
De pureza original
Hasta el feroz animal
Susurra su dulce trino
Detiene a los peregrinos
Libera a los prisioneros
El amor con sus esmeros
Al viejo lo vuelve niño
Y al malo solo el cariño
Lo vuelve puro y sincero

De par en par en la ventana
Se abrió como por encanto
Entró el amor con su manto
Como una tibia mañana
Al son de su bella diana
Hizo brotar el jazmín
Volando cual serafín
Al cielo le puso aretes
Y mis años en diecisiete
Los convirtió el querubín",Volver a Los 17,2006

Foge do teu olhar

Volta pra te encantar
Num sonho tao pequenho
Que o dia escondeu
Guardando pra te dar

Como é bonito gostar e querer ficar

Olha quantas estrelas
Nascem pra te encontrar
Depois do céu azul
A noite vai chegar
E eu pra te amar",Chora Tua Tristeza,2006

Reaching a fever pitch and it's bringing me out the dark.

Go ahead and sell me out and I'll lay your ship bare,
See how I'll leave with every piece of you,
Don't underestimate the things that I will do.

There's a fire starting in my heart,
Reaching a fever pitch and it's bringing me out the dark.

But I've heard one on you and I'm gonna make your head burn,
Think of me in the depths of your despair,
Making a home down there as mine sure won't be shared,

You had my heart inside of your hands,
But you played it with a beating.

Throw your soul through every open door,
Count your blessings to find what you look for.
Turn my sorrow into treasured gold,
You'll pay me back in kind and reap just what you've sown.

É minha só, não é de mais ninguém
Aos outros eu devolvo a dó
Eu tenho a minha dor
Se ela preferiu ficar sozinha,
Ou já tem um outro bem
Se ela me deixou,
A dor é minha,
A dor é de quem tem
Mmmh, mmmh

É o meu lençol, é o cobertor.
É o que me aquece sem me dar calor
Se eu não tenho o meu amor,
Eu tenho a minha dor
A sala, o quarto,
A casa está vazia,
A cozinha, o corredor.
Se nos meus braços,
Ela não se aninha,
A dor é minha, a dor.",De Mais Ninguem,1994
Marisa Monte,"Aqui nessa casa
Ninguém quer a sua boa educação
Nos dias que tem comida
Comemos comida com a mão
E quando a polícia, a doença, a distância, ou alguma discussão
Nos separam de um irmão
Sentimos que nunca acaba
De caber mais dor no coração
Mas não choramos à toa
Não choramos à toa

Aqui nessa tribo
Ninguém quer a sua catequização
Falamos a sua língua,
Mas não entendemos o seu sermão
Nós rimos alto, bebemos e falamos palavrão
Mas não sorrimos à toa
Não sorrimos à toa

Aqui nesse barco
Ninguém quer a sua orientação
Não temos perspectivas
Mas o vento nos dá a direção
A vida que vai à deriva
É a nossa condução
Mas não seguimos à toa
Não seguimos à toa

Eu você em qualquer lugar
Dizendo ""aonde você for eu vou""
E quando eu perguntei
Ouvi você dizer
Que eu era tudo o que você sempre quis

E acabei acreditando em ilusões
Eu nem pensava em ter
Que esquecer você
Agora vem você dizer
""Amor, eu errei com você
E só assim pude entender
Que o grande mal que eu fiz
Foi a mim mesmo""

Por dentro das paredes, pelos quartos, pelos prédios e no portão
Até no que eu não enxergo
Até mesmo quando eu não quero
Eu não quero
Dentro da camisa, no sapato, no cigarro

Fazendo largas sombras sobre o roseiral
E é perfumada a primavera com todo esplendor
Mostrando a natureza todo o seu valor que Deus criou

Eu não pude resistir à tentação
Que a rosa provocou em mim, esta grande paixão
Fui ao jardim e colhi a linda flor

Tem um cantinho escondido
Decorado de saudade

No centro do peito, no largo da ilusão

Coração não tem barreira, não
Desce a ladeira, perde o freio devagar
Eu quero ver cachoeira desabar
Montanha, roleta russa, felicidade
Posso me perder pela cidade

Mesmo quando isso não convém

Amar alguém e outro alguém também
É coisa que acontece sem razão
Embora soma, causa e divisão
Amar alguém só pode fazer bem

Amar alguém só pode fazer bem
Amar alguém só pode fazer bem
Amar alguém só pode fazer bem
Amar alguém

Amar alguém não tem explicação
Não há como conter o furacão
Amores vão embora
Amores vêm
Não se decide amar e nem a quem
Amar alguém só pode fazer bem
Seja só uma pessoa ou um harém
Se não existe algoz e nem refém
Amar alguém e outro alguém também

Amar alguém só pode fazer bem
Amar alguém só pode fazer bem
Amar alguém só pode fazer bem
Amar alguém só pode fazer bem
Amar alguém

Amar alguém só pode fazer bem
Amar alguém só pode fazer bem
Amar alguém só pode fazer bem

Mas passou nosso tempo
Não podemos negar
Foi bom

Lo que no se debe
Es tener la sangre fría

Well, that cannot be denied
But what good's a man's world
Without a woman by his side
And so I will wait
Until that moment you decide

That I'm your man and you're my girl
That I'm the sea and you're the pearl
It takes two, baby, it takes two

A king ain't a king
Without the pow'r behind the throne
A prince is a pauper, babe
Without a chick to call his own
So please, darling, choose me
I don't wanna rule alone, tell me

I'm your king and you're my queen
That no one else can come between
It takes two, baby, it takes two

Don't you know, Lancelot had Guinevere
Mrs. Claus has old St. Nick
Romeo had Juliet
And Liz, well, she has her Dick

They say it takes two to tango
Well, that tango's child's play
So take me to the dance floor
And we'll twist the night away

Just like Frankie Avalon
Had his favorite mouseketeer
I dream of a lover, babe
To say the things I long to hear
So come closer baby
Oh, and whisper in my ear

Tell me, you're my girl and I'm your boy
That you're my pride and I'm your joy
I'm the sand and you're the tide
I'll be the groom if you'll be my bride

Marissa Jaret Winokur,"Psst, Penny, what happened?
My mother's punishing me for going to jail without permission
Well, I'm here to save the fair maiden in her tower
Oh, Seaweed, Tracy, you took beautiful behind bars

It must be the low-watt institutional lighting
Oh Tracy, they can keep us from kissing
But they can't stop us from singing

Once I was a selfish fool who never understood
I never looked inside myself, though on the outside, I looked good
Then we met and you made me the man I am today
Tracy, I'm in love with you, no matter what you weigh 'cause

Without love, life is like the seasons with no summer
Without love, life is rock 'n' roll without a drummer
Tracy, I'll be yours forever 'cause I never wanna be without love
Tracy, never set me free, no, I ain't lyin', never set me free, Tracy
No, no, no

Once I was a simple girl, then stardom came to me
But I was still a nothing, though a thousand fans may disagree
Tracy, fame was just a prison, signing autographs a bore
I didn't have a clue 'til you came banging on my door

That without love, life is like my dad without his bromo
Without love, life is making out with Perry Como
Darling, I'll be yours forever 'cause I never wanna be without love
So darling, throw away the key, I'm yours forever
Throw away the key, yeah, yeah, yeah

Living in the ghetto, black is everywhere ya go
Who'd 've thought I'd love a girl with skin as white as winter's snow
In my ivory tower, life was just a hostess snack
But now I've tasted chocolate and I'm never going back

'Cause without love, life is like a beat that you can't follow without love
Life is Doris day at the Apollo, darling, I'll be yours forever
'Cause i never wanna be without love, so darling, never set me free
I'm yours forever, never set me free, no, no, no

If you're locked up in this prison, Trace, I don't know what I'll do
Link, I've got to break out, so that I can get my hands on you
And girl, if I can't touch you, now, I'm gonna lose control
Seaweed, you're my black white knight, I've found my blue-eyed soul
Sweet freedom is our goal
Trace, I wanna kiss ya, then I can't wait for parole

'Cause without love, life is like a prom that won't invite us without love
Life's getting my big break and laryngitis
Without love, life's a '45' when you can't buy it without love
Life is like my mother on a diet

Like a week that's only Mondays, only ice cream, never sundaes
Like a circle with no center, like a door marked, 'Do Not Enter'
'Cause I never wanna be without love
Yes, now you've captured me without love
I surrender happily, without love

Oh seaweed, never set me free, no, no, no
No, I ain't lyin', never set me free, no, no, no
No, I don't wanna live without love, love, love

It was many and many a year ago
In a kingdom by the sea
That a maiden there lived whom you may know
By the name of Annabelle Lee
And this maiden she lived with no other thought
Than to love and be loved by me

I was a child and she was a child
In this kingdom by the sea
But we loved with a love that was more than love
I and my Annabelle Lee
With a love that the winged seraphs of heaven
Coveted her and me
And this was the reason that, long ago
In this kingdom by the sea
A wind blew out of a cloud, chilling
My beautiful Annabelle Lee
So that her highborn kinsman came
And bore her away from me
To shut her up in a sepulcher
In this kingdom by the sea

Fly around across the ocean and

It's a nice escape, but will it keep you warm at night?

You're so close to me
You're so far away

You're way out of reach

",Come Closer,2006
Marit Larsen,"You say, we must move forward
And I say, let's not go back
Once we were brave explorers
But this trail is a worn-out track
Don't chase that setting sun
Look what we've become

[Chorus]
Don't save me, I'll save you the hassle
Our little castle is a house of cards
It's empty, heartache is pending
This is us ending

You say, you were just kidding
And I say, this is no joke
We've grown and we're not fitting
We've flamed out to a wisp of smoke
Don't turn the truth around
It reads the same way upside-down

[Chorus]
So don't save me
Don't you dare

Little by little, sneaking upon
Till it's too much to ignore
Let's leave in the middle, before it dead ends
I've been down this road

Don't you dare leave me here
I'll go looking elsewhere!

In came the light

",In Came the Light,2006
Marit Larsen,"So you say I need to consider this
Yours were the face that I couldn't resist
Yours was the fuel to the flames in my heart
Mine were the words that would tear us apart

Well I say I found the letters you wrote
Mine was the smile and the life that you broke
Mine was the story that you told your friends
Yours were the demons you couldn't defend

Understand me, as of lately I've learned a thing or two
There is just no way that I'll be coming home to you

[Chorus]
'Cause only a fool would do this again
Only a fool would let you back in
There is no you left to embrace
There is no word would make it feel safe
Love was a gift, stubborn and wild
I was armed with the faith of a child
And you were my joy, you were my friend
There is no going back there again

[Chorus 2]
It's more than you can ask of me my love
I'm coming out of nowhere
It feels good here better than you know
Isn't it only fair that you try and let it go?

Yours was the ring that I started to wear
Yours were the vows that went up in the air
Yours was the choice to stay away from her
Mine was the dream that got lost in the stir

These were the times I would call you my own
These were the times I were waiting at home

I'll tell you something, I've been changing after what you put me through
There is just no way that I'll be coming home to you

[Chorus]

'Cause only a fool would do this again
Only a fool would let you back in
There is no you left to embrace
There is no word would make it feel safe

You give me this and leave me alone here
Do you presume the battle's won?
I'll keep my head above the water
'til you admit the damage's done

Your poison passion came too soon

You cry when you're still alone

I will not let you go destroy this
I won't allow a broken promise
You give me this and leave me wondering

Be the strongest at goodbyes
Know your place in life
Now expand your wings and fly

Enough you seem to me
So incomplete, swept off your feet

And let me tell you they will always pull you down
Before you know it they will take your smile and push you around
They will fight and struggle

Checks your shirt when you get home

She calls you up repeatedly
Knows where you're at all the time

[Chorus]
At night you tell her she's all you long for
But she knows by your face there has got to be more
Her eyes are too narrow, her legs are too long
She knows by this time tomorrow you'll be gone

She used to be ahead
She had thrilling and exciting things to say
She kept you on your toes all the way
But know the tides have turned
You have come too close to knowing her
God forbid you know what she's really like

When she sleeps she keeps her make up on
She prefers to live in a lie

A dream in a jar
A memory scar
Though trapped in a frame
Not one day the same
I fell and I weep
'til I'm too tired to sleep
And I ask permission to land
To strike up the band

Yet I'll build and I'll sow
I'll watch 'til it grows
And I will take the chance
There'll be no last dance

No when it arrives
The darkest of nights
Let me have my back turned
And not realise

The story's coming to an end
I'll never be just giving in
I'm living by the rolling dice
It's closure but it's in disguise

I try and I try (I will try so hard)
I'll play with the fire (I circle around the fire because)
It goes unexplained (it goes unexplained)
I'm still in the game (I'm still in the game)
I'm scared to the bone (I'm scared to the bone)
I'm sitting at home (I'm sitting at home)

So happy that you wanna die
Promises always were crazy to me
But never was I so surprised

Minutes are longer when we are apart
Your presence's more than I can handle
It's come to the point where I wonder if I
Could ever be luckier when

[Chorus]
Suddenly I'm back at the core
Thinking of her who had you before
Were you as good
As good as we are
Do you remember?
Did you love her the way you love me?
Is there a chance that there might be
Traces of her that you carry under the surface?

Lend me your ears, I would like to confess
I'm doubting that you can be real
By your side wearing a beautiful dress
I celebrate how good it feels

Say that you love me, say that it's true
I know that I want to believe you
But somehow silence speaks louder than words
I'm worried she's still on your mind

You turn on your heels and I get burned

There's a land that I've heard of once in a lullaby.
Somewhere over the rainbow, skies are blue
And the dreams that you dare to dream,
Really do come true.

Someday I'll wish upon a star
And wake up where the clouds are far behind me.
Where troubles melt like lemon drops,
High above the chimney tops,
That's where you'll find me.

Somewhere over the rainbow, blue birds fly
Birds fly over the rainbow
Why then, oh why can't I?
If happy little bluebirds fly beyond the rainbow

Has the murmuring sound of may
All silver bells, coral shells, carousels
And the laughter of children at play

And we fade to a marvelous view
Two lovers alone and out of sight
Seeing images in the firelight
As my eyes visualize a family
They see Emily, Emily

When at first your kiss I decline.
On the light in your eyes when I surrender,

Quand tu passes le soir
Auprès des caravanes,
Les yeux luisent d'espoir.
Mayoumba,
Ne remarques-tu pas
Le silence qui plane
Au doux bruit de tes pas ?
Chacun rêve de t'aimer
Dans le jour inlassable,
mais ton c?ur est plus fermé
Que la rose des sables.

Tu te ris de l'amour
Mais la rose se fane
Et les rêves sont courts !

Ce soir le ciel se fait plus lourd,
N'entends-tu pas sous les palmiers
Confiant sa peine au vent léger qui court.
Le chant suppliant de ce chamelier ?

São almas de violetas

Dores amargas e secretas

Pode entender os poetas

Se pudesse mostrar
E o que eu sofro calada
Se pudesse contar

Toda a gente veria
Quanto sou desgraçada
Quanto finjo alegria
Quanto choro a cantar

Que Deus me perdoe
Se é crime ou pecado
Mas eu sou assim
E fugindo ao fado
Fugia de mim

Cantando dou brado
E nada me dói
Se é pois um pecado
Ter amor ao fado
Que Deus me perdoe

Quanto canto não penso
No que a vida é de má
Nem sequer me pertenço
Nem o mal se me dá

Chego a querer a verdade
E a sonhar, sonho imenso
Que tudo é felicidade
E tristeza não há

A thousand times a million doors to eternity
I may have lived a thousand lives, a thousand times
An endless turning stairway climbs
To a tower of souls
If it takes another thousand years, a thousand wars,
The towers rise to numberless floors in space
I could shed another million tears, a million breaths,
A million names but only one truth to face
A million roads, a million fears
A million suns, ten million years of uncertainty
I could speak a million lies, a million songs,
A million rights, a million wrongs in this balance of time
But if there was a single truth, a single light
A single thought, a singular touch of grace
Then following this single point, this single flame,
This single haunted memory of your face
I still love you
I still want you
A thousand times the mysteries unfold themselves
Like galaxies in my head
I may be numberless, I may be innocent
I may know many things, I may be ignorant
Or I could ride with kings and conquer many lands
Or win this world at cards and let it slip my hands
I could be cannon food, destroyed a thousand times
Reborn as fortune's child to judge another's crimes
Or wear this pilgrim's cloak, or be a common thief
I've kept this single faith, I have but one belief
I still love you
I still want you

Like galaxies in my head
On and on the mysteries unwind themselves
Eternities still unsaid

Even though it's breakin'
When there are clouds in the sky
You'll get by

If you smile
Through your fear and sorrow
Smile and maybe tomorrow
You'll find that life is still worthwhile
If you just smile

That's the time
You must keep on trying
Smile,
What's the use of crying
You'll find that life is still worthwhile
If you just smile",Smile [*],2008

Que o povo nos diz que não,
Que o nariz não é feição
Seja grande ou delicado?

Mesmo a quem o não meter
Aonde não é chamado!

Agora a ser rapazote
Acharia que saiote

É que faz ganhar o céu?

Nua sem salamaleque,
Que tive de aprender
É que ai de mim se não for eu!

Ma da dietro una finestra guardo fuori mentre è cominciato a piovere
Pomeriggi tristi e vuoti, scuri come delle vecchie gallerie
I miei giorni sono uguali a quei vagoni fermi nelle ferrovie
Questo maledetto inverno non si ferma sulle porte, gela l'anima
Sto scaldando tra le mani questa penna per provare almeno a scriverti
Cambierebbe tutto quanto all'improvviso se tu fossi qui con me
Perché dentro la mia vita c'è quel vuoto che hai lasciato
E che nessuno può calmare tranne te

Tu che ne sai, che sto ancora a pensarti da solo
Tu che ne sai, e se cade una stella dal cielo la dedico a noi
Che respiro i ricordi più belli in un dolce replay
Ma diventa più grigio del fumo quell'arcobaleno
Non c'è sale nell'acqua del mare
Non riscaldano i raggi del sole, lontano da te
Dove sarai avrai già raccontato la storia che parla di noi
Ce l'hai ancora nascosto il segreto più bello che hai
Io speravo che non arrivasse nemmeno Natale
Passerà però adesso fa male
Perché ho perso la cosa più bella da stringere a me

Questo maledetto inverno non si ferma sulle porte, gela l'anima
Vorrei uscire dalla casa ma i ricordi non mi fanno ancora muovere
Il tuo viso non va via, rimane qui sempre davanti agli occhi miei
Se sapessi che ogni tanto ti ritorno nella mente
Crescerebbe la speranza dentro me

Tu che ne sai, che sto ancora a pensarti da solo
Tu che ne sai, giuro sempre che è l'ultima volta che parlo di noi
Stringo tutta la storia nei pugni, fa male alle mani
Tra un minuto sarà già domani
Ma domani sarà tutto uguale lontano da te

Girl, how many stories can you fit into a tanktop?

How many wishes get spent on what you ain't got?
The youth want truth, well thank god
Tryin to keep it movin, while you're sittin in the same spot
Been in this cage for a long time (long time)

Been coverin this page with the wrong rhymes (wrong rhymes)
Got a strong mind, I got a weak will
I've got bad nerves and I can't keep still
But I stay humble, so when the meek take the planet

I can get a little piece with my name on it
The only problem is by then I won't want it
I'm in the backyard praying and hoping for the comet
Are you lookin to remember or searchin for adventure?

I guess it all depends on the agenda
Do you carry a grudge? Do you carry a gun?
I guess it all depends on where you come from
Surroundings are gonna dictate the needs

And I'll be back when its happy hour

But I'm home now, and things still look the same

To a life where I can't watch the sun set

Anything else would have been confused
But I want to see you again

Should run a bath and then clear up the mess i made before i left here
Try to remind myself that i was happy here,
Before I knew that I could get on a plane and fly away,

To a life where I can watch the sun set,
And take my time
Take all my time

I ran to the terminal building, to fly by my airline
The man said I could ride the wing and I said that was fine
He said ""I'll confirm your reservation, and put the plane on hold""
He came back and said ""Sorry but that wing space just been sold""

If I can't leave here, I just might stay
And that L.A. flyway is goin' to be my home, umm, huum, baby

I walked into the washroom and I built myself a fire
Throw on lots of paper and the flames kept gettin' higher
The janitor come runnin' in, so scare his face was white
So, I explained my situation, he said ""That's all right""

If I can't leave here, I just might stay
And that L.A. flyway is goin' to be my home

Next day I thought that I would leave, so I packed my thing again
Waited 14 hours for a taxi to come in
Spotted one that wasn't full and I threw myself in fast
The driver said ""I'm sorry but this taxi's out of gas""

If I can't leave here, I just might stay
And that L.A. flyway is goin' to be my home",The Great Airplane Strike,1966

Don't turn away
It's you I'm singing for
I'm blinded by the things you do
The things you say
I wanted so much more
And when I say these words to you
In honesty
Oh will you understand
You don't know what I'm going through
So promise me
You'll let go off my hand

You mean so very much to me
Your every touch
A vampire's gentle kissSurrendering so helplessly
So good - too much
The moments I will miss
So now I have to say goodbye
So torn apart
And black is all I see
To stay would mean I'd surely die

Your love is killing me

It's tearing me apart - your love
It's tearing at my heart - your love
It's tearing me apart - your love
It's killing me
and tearing deep into my heart - your love
Tearing me apart - your love
It's tearing at my heart - your love
Oh your love, your love, your love is tearing me apart

The ghost of love is haunting me
It's her I fear
Her poison is so sweet
The flame of love is burning me
For you so dear
Oh God I feel so weak
I'll love you 'till the day I die
Forget me not

Mark A. Humphrey,"The night was black, rain fallin' down;
Looked for my baby, she's nowhere around.
Traced her footsteps down to the shore,
'Fraid she's gone forever more.       
I looked at the sea and it seemed to say,
""I took your baby from you away.""
I heard a voice cryin' in the deep,
""Come join me baby in my Endless Sleep.""

Why did we quarrel, why did we fight?
Why did I leave her alone tonight?
That's why her footsteps ran into the sea
That's why my baby has gone from me.
I looked at the sea and it seemed to say,
""I took your baby from you away.""
I heard a voice cryin' in the deep,
""Come join me baby in my Endless Sleep.""

Ran in the water, heart full of fear,
There in the breakers I saw her near;
Reached for my darlin', held her to me,
Stole her away from the angry sea.
I looked at the sea and it seemed to say,
""You took your baby from me away.""
My heart cried out, ""She's mine to keep.""
I saved my baby from an Endless Sleep.",Endless Sleep,1996

Mark Adler,"When they begin the beguine
It brings back the sound of music so tender
It brings back a night of tropical splendor
It brings back a memory ever green

I'm with you once more under the stars
And down by the shore an orchestra's playing
And even the palms seem to be swaying
When they begin the beguine

To live it again is past all endeavor
Except when that tune clutches my heart
And there we are, swearing to love forever
And promising never, never to part

What moments divine, what rapture serene
Till clouds came along to disperse the joys we had tasted
And now when I hear people curse the chance that was wasted
I know but too well what they mean

So don't let them begin the beguine
Let the love that was once a fire remain an ember
Let it sleep like the dead desire I only remember
When they begin the beguine

Oh yes, let them begin the beguine, please make them play
Till the stars that were there before return above you
Till you whisper to me once more, ""Darling, I love you""
Then we suddenly know what heaven we're in

I could live without love
Now I must admit,

That you'll be sweet & gentle,

And cram it up your two tone ass.â??
But not in this case, it's good, it's really good.
And my name isn't Marty. Back to you Frank.â??

Now that the whole third wave is gone,
It's time for us to carry on.
We took a break and stayed away,

We've set the pace for metalliska.

We think skacore's pretty lame,

We'll introduce you to our friend Wayne.

Mark Aldrich,"Gentlemen, we need to sell more papers
There's an answer right before your eyes, but you're just not thinking this through
Nunzio knows, when he's cutting my hair
Trim a bit here 
And then trim a bit there
Just a modest adjustment
Can fatten the bottom line

What if we cut back personnel?

How about a few salary trims?

We could lower the price of the paper

Bankrupting me even faster
Let me try again
Shaving is tricky: The razor should float
Shave me too close 
And you may slit my throat
Its the simplest solutions
That bolster the bottom line

I've got it 
If we charge the Newsies sixty cents per hundred instead of fifty

They'd have to sell ten more papers just to earn the same amount as always

My thought exactly
It's genius

It's gonna be awfully rough on those children

They'll be learning a real life lesson in economics 
I couldn't offer them a better education if they were my own
Give me a week and I'll train them to be
Like an army that's marching to war
Proud of themselves and so Grateful to me
They'll be begging to pay even more
When there's dirt on our shoes, boys
For God's sake, relax
Why throw them out?
All we need is some wax
Listen well to these barbershop lessons
For they'll see you through

When you're stuck in the muck you'll be fine
You'll erase any trace of decline

With a trim

And a snip

And a shine

And the power of the press
Yes, once again is mine
The price for the Newsies goes up in the morning
Just a few common cents

It's income for you
Thanks to that bottom line",The Bottom Line,1992

So what do you say?

I win either way

Too bad you've no job, Jack
But you did resign
Too bad you've no family
But you can't have mine
Be glad you're alive, boy
