Miike Snow,"How long has it been, shall we get into it again?
Excuse, our disgrace 
We've had no time to paint the place
The dog is always barking at the mailman

I won't waste your time with my revelation
Hello my friend, I see you're back again
Hello mystery, don't bother to explain
How 'bout maybe, its all been in my head
Hey well I'm tired of this black and blue, black and blue

My dear, come again? Your voice is fading out and in
Out of the laundry bin, I found my innocence again
The dog is always barking at the mailman

I won't waste your time with my revelation
Hello my friend, I see you're back again
Hello mystery, don't bother to explain
How 'bout maybe, its all been in my head
Hey well I'm tired of this black and blue, black and blue

Hello my friend, I see you're back again
Hello mystery, don't bother to explain
How 'bout maybe, its all been in my head
Hey well, I'm tired of this black and blue, black and blue",Black & Blue,2009
Miike Snow,"Misery is all we know lately
Saturdays are all the same
Sympathy is overrated
Like a snapshot when you've lost the game

Now it's all the funeral
I've become a serial
Killer of us both
Now it's all the funeral
I've become a serial
Killer of us both

No, I
Don't want to get thrown in your ocean
Don't try
You know that we already know it
It's over

At your own burial
Don't forget to cry
At your own burial

Licking up my eighty-first birthday
Every day this body goes to waste
Remembering how I would raise an army
When we went back to your place

Now it's all the funeral
I've become a serial
Killer of us both
Now it's all the funeral
I've become a serial
Killer of us both

No, I
Don't want to get thrown in your ocean
Don't try

Miike Snow,"All my life I've been the slave of consequence
Wondering how this life could be so intricate
I wanna rewrite my heart and let the future in
I wanna open it up and let somebody in

Can you free me from the logic that I knew
I believe it even if it is not true

Am I falling asleep on my feet again?
I call out, is anybody listening
And it's like I'm diving into emptiness
But at least there's something beating in my chest

Can you free me from the logic that I knew
I believe it even if it is not true

Can you free me from the logic that I knew
I believe it even if it is not true",Cult Logic,2009
Miike Snow,"Last call for everything
A pool of emmalines delirious
She lingers like a chain
It's more than grave but not to serious
Send your reverie to me
Faker

Into the mouth of green morning
Faker
I am so wide awake
The wind is moving blossoms through the door
It's more than I can take
But half as much as what it was before

Send your reverie to me
Faker
Into the mouth of green morning
Faker",Faker,2009
Miike Snow,"Oh God I think I'm dying
And our drinks were just poured
Look outside someone's waiting
With a yellow horse

With a hole in my heart I was s'posed to ride
In morning traffic
With a golden hand by your fortress side
But without magic
Somebody, somebody, somebody tell me
It wont be long
Cause a horse is not a home
A horse is not a home

Uninvited to the play where language doesn't hurt
With nothing on my shirt
Sometimes I swim with you in a room that is ocean sized and clear
Not here where all I breath is smoke

With a hole in my heart I was s'posed to ride
In morning traffic
With a golden hand by your fortress side
But without magic
Somebody, somebody, somebody tell me
It wont be long
Cause a horse is not a home
A horse is not a home

With a hole in my heart I was s'posed to ride
In morning traffic
With a golden hand by your fortress side
But without magic

Miike Snow,"Yes, I've been living long enough to be
Forgiven
For the bones I broke I had to make
A living (a living)

But we won't back down from anything
In search of a remedy
No we won't back down from anything
In search of a remedy

Father put his foot down on my games
Forever
So in the marketplace I stay calm
And clever

And we won't back down from anything
In search of a remedy

No we won't back down from anything
In search of a remedy",In Search Of,2009
Miike Snow,"I was born into money,
And sold down the river.
I was choked by the jailor
And fucked the gorilla.
I ran through the country ahead of my time.
I escaped through a keyhole before they erased me
I married the beetle and learned to be graceful
It's why all this warfare pours out of my eyes.

Now I see just what you mean
It hurts too much to breathe
All alone in this plastic jungle
Sometimes I wanna get slain
I wanna get slain
I wanna get slain
I wanna get slain
I wanna get slain
I wanna get slain
I wanna get slain
I wanna get la la la la la 

She told me loved me
I didn't believe her.
The son of a junkie is ancient Korean
But don't blame the girl she's out of her mind

Now I see just what you mean
It hurts too much to bleed
All alone in this plastic jungle
Sometimes I wanna get slain
I wanna get slain
I wanna get slain
I wanna get slain

Miike Snow,"Reach the city steps tonight
Following the power lines

Met a man barside
With eclipses for eyes
And you tell yourself you wont let them touch
Did I say too much did I say enough
I don't know Sylvia
I don't know Sylvia

Circle round the room still
Breaking my will

Know I can't have you here
Someone else on your skin

And it's all my fault for not getting off
And you made it start, can you make it stop?
You don't know Sylvia
You don't know Sylvia

Damn
Damn

Reach the city steps tonight
Following the power lines

And your skin is so white
Underneath the black night
And your voice calls out for the Coup de grace
When the lights go out will there be a trace?
I don't know Silvia
That I loved, Silvia
That I loved, Silvia",Silvia,2009
Miike Snow,"I met you on the palisades
The sun was spilling kerosene
And I was feeling wide awake
Girl, you can be so obscene
And when you sang a lullaby
A missionary called your name
You disappeared and hopped a flight
For the Serengeti plain

Tell everyone you know
Open up the door
Tell everyone you know
Open up the door

When your love has gone
You carry on
This is her song
This is a song for no one
This is a song for no one

I think I own a photograph
That shows her in the freezing rain
With the Italians on the bank
They know how to entertain
A string of pearls behind your hair
A music box to catch your tears
Now call your mother in L.A.
She hasn't heard your voice in years

Tell everyone you know
Open up the door
Tell everyone you know
Open up the door

When your love has gone
You carry on
This is her song
This a song for no one (x3)

When your love has gone
You carry on
This is her song
This a song for no one

You can jump a ride
But don't ask why
And don't close your eyes

This a song for no one (x3)",Song for No One,2009
Miike Snow,"Hey, I can't hear what you say
And I got lost in a maze
The world got swallowed by the place

How, I'm standing hearing your name
You're moving to the sound of a train
That Carrie Billie Holliday away

And when the sun shines down, it shines on both of us
And when the storm falls down, it falls too high to touch
And you say that you can't get away
But the night is just enough for both of us
Both of us, both of us, both of us

You, don't look so confused
It's all been dressed to be improved
I guess i don't read the news

Here haven't think of disguise
And see the stone blast in your eyes
But don't say I never try

And when the sun shines down, it shines on both of us

Miike Snow,"Off and on, off and on
The lights in my head flip off and on
Down below, down below
The sweat on my hands is not my own
Just put a saddle on me
And ride me where you wanna get
Take you to the Nortebel 
It's spreading and I wanna show you something
It's hidden over there
Right behind the chair

I tried to beat the devil too many times
I'm in love and she is tragic magic
I wanna listen to my evil eye and I put her down but
She won't have it
I wanna know, I wanna know, I wanna know
Which way to go
Before it tramples on me
But the rabbit jumps back in it's hole
And I forget that I am just like everybody else (Everybody else)

Hear me out, hear me out
The ape and the blade show fears the doubts
Hear me out, hear me out,
Your sweet little stain just won't wash out
I wanna share our little dreams
And flip you like a fader now
Life is full of lasers now
And you're spreading when I pop you like a button
Honey, where's your child?

Miike Snow,"Please, the ward he offers me a pack of cigarettes
They aren't his, and yet I feel it coming on
I feel it coming on a sense of welling grief
And though they're serving samovar, somehow I'd rather be

Up in an airplane above the archipelago
I stuttered in my armour in an airplane above the archipelago
I could see where you grew up, and the murderer in me

Please, the blanket and the sheets,
The leaves the gardener rakes are articles of faith
The company believes I'm running derelict around these foreign streets
The colonel knows I want to crack his head for taking me

Up in an airplane above the archipelago
I stuttered in my armour in an airplane above the archipelago
Now I see where you grew up, and the murderer in me

Is there a way in
It's gone so long now
With our faces at the wind

Would you come over
Forgive my hard ways
And stay up all night
Like the Chinatown parades

Say you will
Say you will
Say you will
I won't climb out through the other door
If I ask you to
Say you will
Say you will

I can't be trusted
To wait on hard times
I'd rather run out
And be caught behind the lines

Open corridors
Light up the paintings
Aww, come on over
And keep away the shakes

Say you will
Say you will
Say you will
I won't climb out through the other door

They tried but they won't save us

Miike Snow,"I bought you a black tin box,
Something to put your jewelry in.
But it struck me as the property of the childless.
It was cold out and warm in.

Miike Snow,"The blinds here are so sharp and they cut,
The light from the primitive sun
You know I really wanted her

Society thinks so highly of
This hotel I vomited on
Before I lost the sight of her

My man, he quietly closes the door
Now the pharaoh is woken,
My hands, I feel like I've been here before
She has already spoken

Anyway
There's no reason to get hurt
You don't need to sell your shirt
To do the devil's work

You finally found your place
You know it always works
You know it always works

I saw someone who looked like you on
The platform at Bondi station
But from a younger era

The lights in the bell house were still on
We all need somebody to love,
Be we clothed or naked.

I play the DL and watch the outskirts
I write an I'll verse and never shout words that make makes my mouth hurt
I go to' place and rap to groovy breaks
Popping in the fuji tape and watch all the moves we make
We're getting open until we're choking
I feel over in the goodie goodie, the woodies are swinging while he's
Smoking
I generate the girls, good night, I spread the hood life
My lyrics and my style don't match what I look like
You know not to pass judgement, my ass ain't budging
I kill a fast dozen of your family and do your last cousin
Straight from Jersey doing just what I feel
Steal a meal, I'm the druggie that deal but keep it real

We were beginners in the hood and my mentality
Is keeping it real, packing steel, getting high (keep it real)
We were beginners in the hood and my mentality
Is keeping it real, packing steel, getting high (keep it real)

My lifestyle's fast lane without speed bumps or rolling tree stumps
Given free blunts, I only had to smoke weed once
To rap while I puff that and chill as I bust back
To battle miilk I love rap to beat me I don't puff crack
See I'm the dopest that you don't wanna smoke with
Been rhyming since the days of puffing joints out the roach clips
I wake up every morning and I always wonder why
Peeps are ODed treat my streets like a slumber
This ain't a vacation spot so go claim your Glock
So many names with spray cans we can paint the blocks
I dream tough, I never chill with no creeper with no cream puff
Hang the sporty kid at bottom of my saggy jeans cuffed
I keep the power to speak, I ain't a flower for freaks
My dirt's deep, I even go without a shower for weeks
So back up off it, you fags had to forfeit
I wet so many heads they call my crew Farrah Fawcett
Sprinkle over here there whenever I feel
I'm no beginner or winner but my deal will keep it real

The pain soothing and my crew got the same movement
The boom's like the moon on the run from the Sun
Stay spark in the dark daily where we come from
I'm cool with the careless kids who rock crusty fronts
They got rusty lungs from smoking dusty blunts
They puff like pros so call em ashtray mouths
Cause there was a halfway house and this is my last day out
So I'mma catch wreck, knock off your headset
Bullet holes in five-o will make the the funny feds sweat
I'm from' AKA The Violent Village
Dirty Delaney is where I be illin
My tiny town is thumbs down
Finger tips are splitting blunts
Competition walks away, fixin' fronts
I bully break beats and dominate my I'll fate
Lampin' on the milk crate until late it feels great

Come on, come on, there's a little party over here
It's too hot, give my crew props, let them know I'm here
I'm shoutin out to everybody on the ave's who hustle bags
From Buckshot over to Kurupt and Daz
And the bully blocks don't stop the track
I rock in universal cities for the college frats
It's on like that, I'm 'die-hard' like Bruce Willis
And if Biggie Smalls comes this party is the illest
Where's the party at?

There's a party over here)	--> Fam of Rottin Razcalz

Settin it off is Miilkbone, so everybody chill

If the party's liver
We're gonna glide through the night and morn'
Since the party's liver
Slip in those grooves and let's get it on

Throw your hands in the air and let me hear you say yeah
(Yeah!) and act like you don't care
It's Hot like 97, the cops are finally lettin
Kids kiss like 98, now it's that time for sweatin
So now ain't nobody gonna tell me how 
To make your ears bust nuts when I turn the party out
I make your girl bleed greed, plant my seed, it's agreed
That Miilk got the brand new flava that you need
So come on get down and tell me how you feelin
Sexual healing's waiting for you on the ceiling
And all you gotta do is just reach out
Let the beat ride, there's a party on the street side
Outside's helter skelter, here's the shelter
To help ya, cause this track's hot to melt ya
So everybody get upon down
Cause when I'm around and move with the groove it's the bomb sound
Where's the party at?

[ CHORUS ]

Now all I want to know is Jersey in the house
Oaktown, Detroit, Chicago, Houston turns it out
D.C. could see me to Norfolk, Virginia
Spin to Atlanta and Keith Murray'll get in ya
I go 'round like Mary Mary jeopardy to double
My daily ??? are barely able to hear me (oh really)
Get your groove on with more tricks
Like on a Pussy Prairie in the Kitty Cabin at Fort Dicks
We ran a train like transit, it's gone, I got shit sewn
It's the mutha number one, the honkey Miilkbone
So big up to Big D and Uptown
Naught and Illtown, Heavy D spreads the love 'round

Busco en tu mirada
Por si hay una mínima señal

Ya son muchos años tras de ti
Este amigo te ama, eres el sosiego
Que la vida me heredo

Tengo amor que llora triste
Porque no te puedo amar
Me has quitado media vida
Eres amor sin completar
Como flecha sin un blanco
Como inverno sin llover
Como barco en un desierto
Como fruta sin comer

Solo Dios sabe
Cuanto me ha mordido este dolor
De verte con otros
De ser confidente y nada mas

Cada día te quiero un poco mas

Me alimento de ti, me alimento de ti

Tienes el veneno que fascina en tu mirar
Mujer alabastrina
Tienes vibración de sonatina pasional

Tienes el perfume de un naranjo en flor
El altivo porte de una majestad
Sabes de los filtros que hay en el amor
Tienes el hechizo de la liviandad

La divina magia de un atardecer
Y la maravilla de la inspiración
Tienes en el ritmo de tu ser
Todo el palpitar de una canción
Eres la razón de mi existir, mujer

",Mujer,1992
Mijares,"Sólo tú eres la verdad
La que yo quiero como amiga
Como amor, como realidad
La que no necesita

Mas pasión que la que le doy
La que roba todas mis caricias
Ideal, casi angelical
Tanta honestidad casi me irrita

¿Qué puedo hacer yo con tanto amor?
Tanta perfección, me ahogaría
Es casi una agresión
No me puedo defender
¿Qué podría yo ofrecer ante éste amor?

Solo tú eres la verdad
Pero sé que me amas a tu forma
Y es que yo siempre te soñé
Mas amante que novia

Más que amor, naturalidad
Mas de carne y menos divina
Mas de piel, menos ideal
Algo menos fiel me excitaría

¿Qué puedo hacer yo con tanto amor?
Tanta perfección, me ahogaría
Es casi una agresión, no me puedo defender
¿Qué podría yo ofrecer ante éste amor?

Como mujer eres la mejor mujer
Pero fracasamos piel con piel

¿Qué puedo hacer yo con tanto amor?
Tanta perfección, me ahogaría
Es casi una agresión, no me puedo defender
¿Cómo puedo compartir con tanto amor?

No podemos controlar la situación

Que los celos

Que sin tu amor no hay nada
Mi vida no es igual

¿Qué sucedió porque todo cambio?
Culpable o no, no acepto la razón
Cuando un amor ha sido siempre fiel
Merece por lo menos se le trate bien

Siempre soñar y juntos despertar
Quise pensar que tú sentías igual
Me equivoque pues tú querías volar
Me dicen que hace tiempo
Hay otro en mi lugar

¿Qué sucedió, porque todo cambio?
Culpable o no, no acepto la razón
Cuando un amor ha sido siempre fiel
Merece por lo menos se le trate bien

Debo de hablar
Quiero encontrar una razón
Que me lleve al camino
Donde yo pueda entender la verdad

Y que me enseñe a aceptar mi destino
Y sin llorar cuando te escuche hablar
Pueda decir que al final fui un testigo
De un gran amor que murió
De un gran amor

Hay que olvidar sé que esto va a costar
Hay que entender que el tiempo pasará
Y alguna vez que quiera recordar
Quizá sin que me duela acepte que no estas
Que no estás

Cuando todo te ha salido siempre mal 
Como cerrar tanta heridas 
Si la sangre no ha dejado de brotar 
Cuando el precio de la vida es tan difícil de pagar 

Como rogarle al destino 
Cuando estoy acostumbrado a arrebatar 
Porque hoy que te he encontrado 
No te apartes de mi lado 
No derrumben nuestros sueños 
Ni se atreva a separarnos 

Voy a exigirle a la vida 
Que me pague contigo 
Que me enseñe el sentido del dolor 
Porque ya fue suficiente el castigo 
De no haberte conocido 
Y dejar de ser por siempre un mendigo del amor

Que mi búsqueda contigo termino 
Que dos caminos tan distintos 
En algún momento el tiempo los unio

He works hard to give her all he thinks she wants
But it tears her apart 'cause nothing's for her heart
He pulls in late to wake her up with a kiss goodnight
If he could only read her mind, she'd say

Buy me a rose
Call me from work
Open a door for me what would it hurt?
Show me you love me by the look in your eyes
These are the little things
I need the most in my life

Now the days have grown

'Cause lately she'd try anything just to turn his head
Ooh, would it make a difference if she'd say, if she'd say

Buy me a rose
Call me from work
Open the door for me what would it hurt?
Show me you love me by the look in your eyes
These are the little things
I need the most in my life

And the more that he lives
The less that he tries
To show her the love that he holds inside
And the more that she gives
The more that he sees
This is the story of you
And me

So I bought you a rose
On the way home from work
To open the door to a heart that I hurt
And I hoped you noticed this look in my eyes
'Cause I'm gonna make things right
For the rest of your life (rest of your life)
I'm gonna hold you tonight, tonight
Do all those little things
For the rest of your life

Al ritmo de la lluvia

Jamás pensé que un día
Me faltaras tanto

Será por que tus manos
Hoy se han vuelto todo
Será por que el silencio
Se me ha hecho poco

Por que al abrir los ojos
Te me vas
Por que será tan duro despertar
Solo, tan solo

Tu me haz dicho que soy parte
De tu cuerpo y de tu mente
Que sin mi no vivirías para siempre
Que te había acostumbrado al calor que yo te daba
Que sentías la verdad cuando te amaba
Yo no puedo entender que tu te vayas hoy
Que se llegue a olvidar lo q pasó

Me acordaré de ti, cada minuto amor
Es fácil pues te llevo aquí en el corazón
Lo que nos sucedió no se puede olvidar
Es lo mas bello que haz dejado en tu lugar

En la vida se nos marca una línea que es la pauta
A seguir el camino de una historia
Pero a veces se equivoca
No todo es color de rosa
Y tenemos que seguir como hasta ahora

Mik,"Tyler we ah, I know it's short notice but I brought all your friends here
For some reason I couldn't get a hold of Taco and Jasper
But, I just brought all your friends to talk to you
Because, they're really worried about you
I thought it would be better if, they could talk to you

It was all a dream, I used to read Complex magazines
When I rhyme I'm tryna get pictures in High Times
Smoke trees and see my dreams hanging in the sky line
Swanton bomb off the bed into a fine dime
In my mind I'm just tryna smoke the finest
And get high sticking bad hyenas in vagina's
I'm the fliest when it come to this, fire when I come to spit
I am getting higher when the lighter comes in front of this
I'm a stoner yeah, yeah, yeah you get the picture now
30 thousand feet gon' make it hard for me to simmer down
Another flight, another beat, another city, wow
Thus another couple bitches crying when I kick 'em out
Where we at? We on top of the world

And five minutes from suicide, I biked it to the park
I walked onto the block, met a guy, burgundy 'Preme snap-back
Hurling himself and cars, and flirting with blond Cadillacs
All was great, all was great, Frankie had the blues in fact
Bunch of pale hipster girls, pretty, but they booty flat
Teenage males, couldn't tell, I was going through
And had a wallet full of cream, Amex Green, Beamer almost black
Parked in front the studio Bastard's recorded at
Earl, Gilbert, Tyler, Hodgy, Domo, Left, Taco, Nakel
Sydney, Lionel, Juan, Michael, Jasper, Hal and Matt
Bet I'm missing several but I had to bring that pattern back
We live inside a house that says fuck 'em on the welcome mat
Deep inside the ear canals of Bill O'Reilly's daughter that's
Where I'm at? Now where we at? Wolf Gang, where we at?

Swell motions get promotions, to my whole team
Hell yeah I smoke weed 'cause I like to go green
Professor Beats educates niggas, let me proceed
Shine chandelier bright mike, if your nose bleeds
We at Randy's ordering that 306
Milk and glaze is the greed gold mix me
Your bitch is coming along, yeah she hum to my song
Singing like they were for her, but they were for the blur
No longer, but we working, premature, immature
She's unsure, I'm for sure, blouse and dress and my shirt
On the floor then pick it up, out the door, door
Chased, an imaginary friend, a reverie absorption
Impregnate the dream 'til it has an abortion
Where we at? We on top of the world

Everything they say I'd never have, I'm seeing
Now, I bet they see that we balling like All-Star Weekend
Always been the most cool, they chase our shade
They say life switches pace when you got shit made
So I'm just tryna get paid, don't you remember the days
When your dreams were the only thing that kept you sane
And too often they think that they could stop me
Now every show we makin' half a Maserati
And the only thing blocking me is paparazzi
Now it's gold Rolex's if they try to clock me
Everything stays in the box like fighters in hockey
Miss me if you're thinking we slack, work hard
I got the world saying every single Friday is black
Took your bitch, you ain't getting her back, 'cause she know
Where we at nigga?
We on top of the world

Where we at, niggas?
Where the fuck we at, man?
You niggas don't know me, huh
Where we at?

Down to fucking Earth, huh, down to fucking Earth, huh
Fuck everybody, here goes some extra girth Sir
You fucking critics are making my nerves hurt
Since I'm saying fuck everybody I guess that I'm a fucking pervert
My window is a book and I'm a fucking crook
Stealing phones to call home but the line is off the hook
My mom ain't paid the bill, guess I can't pay it either
I ain't signed a fucking deal yet
But when I do Clancy and Dave are to take a percentages
That could pay the whole city's fucking mortgage
Hopefully I make a lot porn from touring in fucking Oregon
From playing piano organs and hopefully I can pay the bill
Shit is getting real, people begin to feel
Like I'm changing, but their complaining making big fucking deals
About some shit, they bitch and pout
(Can we get backstage man?) No, fagot, it's sold out
(Come on why you holding out, I though we was boys, without me
You wouldn't be Tyler the Creator, you're from the Dirty
I can tell whenever you perform, a leopard can't change it's spots)
But I'm a fucking unicorn (Whatever man)
Look, you can't stop me, I'm going full monty
Fuck that, I'm Hitler, everyone's a fucking Nazi
Wolf Gi-di-dang you be roaming where the fox be
And I be where, anybody cares
I try to preach ""Fuck age, live dreams and have fun""
(Here's some give a fuck, cake) Oh, maybe I should have some
(Asshole, have none) How can I wake up on the wrong side
Of the bed, when I don't even fucking have one?
When I'm on that stage I feel important
A whole fucking assortment of children that's taking Ritalin
Because the teacher said that the therapist wasn't feeling him
You gotta be fucking kidding me
At school I was a zero, now I'm every boy's hero
And they fear it when they hear it when that little fucker's reciting my lyrics
Yeah rebel nigga cheer it, dead parents everywhere, it's smelling like teen spirit

And everything in between
Like it's nothing and the words are easy

You talk about me, you talk about you
And everything I do
Like it's somethin' that needs repeating

I don't need an alibi
For you to realize
The things we left unsaid
Are only taking space up in our heads

Make it my fault, win the game
Point the finger, place the blame
And toss me up and down
Doesn't matter now

'Cause I don't care if I ever talk to you again
This is not about emotion
I don't need a reason not to care
What you say, or what happened in the end
This is my interpretation
And it don't, don't make sense

The first two weeks turn into ten
I hold my breath and wonder when it'll happen
It doesn't really matter

If half of what you said is true
And half of what I didn't do could be different
Would it make you better?

If we forget the things we know
Would we have somewhere to go?
The only way is down
I can see that now

'Cause I don't care if I ever talk to you again
This is not about emotion
I don't need a reason not to care
What you say, or what happened in the end
This is my interpretation
And it don't, don't make sense

Is splitting up such a sacrifice?

If I every talk to again
This is not about emotion

Could we make it better, stormy weather?
So hard to know

Who will believe me, won't deceive me
Won't try to change me?

Ah, ah, ah, is there anybody home?

And with your bitter words you kick me in the gutter
But my troops are bigger than yours
'Cause you'll never stand my fight

Ours is a family that's based upon tradition
But with my careless words I tread upon your vision
Are five kids better than one? Who doesn't like to be gone?

Means that when we have parted

If you leave me all alone, I'll make a mess for sure
I've a heart of gold in the smallest size
Leave me in the dark, you'll never hear me cry

More than an illustration
Points of articulation
Come to life on a brass spring
Such a wonderful plaything

It's a cruel cross that I have to bear
If you come a little close I'm going to pull your hair
More than just a toy in a patch-blue suit
Hold me in your arms I'm just a boy like you

But your mama thought there was somethin' wrong
Didn't want you sleeping with a boy too long
It's a serious thing in a grown-up world
Maybe you'd be better with a Barbie girl

You knew that I adored ya
But you left me in Georgia
Toys are not sentimental
How could I be for rental?

She's the meanest hag that has ever been
Pulled out my insides with an old safety pin
I'm the sorest sight, now I feel like trash
Clothes are made of rags and they don't even match

So she dressed me up as the man she loved
Then threw me in a box when she had had enough
Now the light of day I no longer see
She stuck her voodoo pins where my eyes used to be

Accidentally tragic
Victim of her black magic
Had a boy once who loved me
Now he's so afraid of me

On a long lost day when you're gray and dull
You'll be there remembering your old toy boy
When your oldest son wonderin' what to be
Tell him the story of a boy like me",Toy Boy,2009

And you know heroes aren't meant to survive
So much harder to love when alive
Walk with the devil in your head
You would think you were better off dead

Where can you go?
We fight we earn
We never learn
And through it all
The hero falls

I wish there was a way
To give you a hand to hold
You don't have to die in your glory
To never grow old",Heroes,2012
Mika,"Karen a vingt ans
Oui mais Karen n’a rien d’autre
Et le temps file
Déjà entre ses doigts
Accoudée au bar, rue des martyrs	
Au 82, Karen fait son bilan
Elle voudrait une vie meilleure
Que ses frères et ses sœurs 
Qui sont rentrés dans les rangs

Karen dit que Paris c’est grand
Qu’une autre vie l’attend 
Elle dit qu’on ne l’achèt’ra pas 
Karen mise encore sur le rouge
De ses lèvres et elle bouge
Elle dit qu’elle vaut mieux qu’ça
Karen s’en fout, elle est libre
Elle est libre

Karen dit qu’elle sera une star 
Couche avec des connards
Elle dit qu’elle f’ra des envieux
Karen trinque toujours « à la vôtre »
Chante les chansons des autres 
Chante ses rêves et les nôtres
Chante au bistrot « 82 »

Karen a trente ans 
Mais elle n’a rien d’autre à faire
Même pas des enfants
Même pas la poussière
Elle vit chez sa mère, juste à deux rues
Du « 82 », un jour l’amour est venu
Il a frappé à sa porte 
Elle a crié « Qu’il sorte 
Moi j’ouvre pas aux inconnus »

Karen dit que Paris c’est grand
Qu’une autre vie l’attend
Elle dit qu’on ne l’achèt’ra pas

Karen s’en fout, elle est libre
Elle est libre

Couche avec des connards
Elle dit qu’elle f’ra des envieux
Karen trinque toujours « à la vôtre »
Chante les chansons des autres 
Chante ses rêves et les nôtres
Chante au bistrot « 82 »

Karen a 50 ans
Pas d’allocs’, pas d’argent
Elle fume et tousse
Sur un petit lit blanc
Elle se dit qu’elle pass’ra boire un verre
Au 82, mais elle mourra juste avant
Sur son vieux mat’las pourri
Ces chiens de ressorts
Qui lui rentrent dans les flancs

Karen dit que la vie c’est dur    
Va tout droit dans le mur
Elle dit qu’on ne l’arrêt’ra pas
Karen mise alors sur le noir
Ferme ses yeux et se barre
Sans comprendre pourquoi
Karen s’en va, elle est libre
Elle est libre
Fin de l’histoire
Fin de l’histoire

Karen dit qu’elle sera une Star 
Couche avec des connards 
Elle dit qu’elle f’ra des envieux

You'll beg and borrow, cheat or steal
Trying to get some money just to call her

C'est vrai que les murs ont des oreilles,
Que tous les voisins se réveillent
Mais c'est comme ça qu'on fait l'amour
Quand toi et moi on fait boum boum boum

Et tous les bourgeois du 16ème
Se demandent pourquoi je t'aime
Pour n'avoir pas besoin d'un zoom
Quand toi et moi on fait boum boum boum

S'aimer comme ça, c'est pas vulgaire
On a toujours un truc à faire,
Les étagères font badaboum
Quand toi et moi on fait boum boum boum!

Boum boum, boum boum boum

En plus ça, ça fait toujours deux
De plus de ça fait tout ce qu'on veut
C'est comme les coups de Brahim Asloum
Toi plus moi ça fait boum boum boum
Pas la peine d'aller cavaler
Y a plus toi qui me fait voyager
Voir les cocotiers de Touloum

Mika,"It's an age-old conversation
That is changing with the times
But it's oh so complicated
If your mother is like mine
All that she wants are the stars and the moon
A son with a wife and a big living room
All she wants
Is another little special arrangement
A peculiar engagement
Got the trophy wife, that's respectable
To avoid any spectacle
It's another simple solution
For my mother's delusion
Get her some adorable pictures done
For her mother in Lebanon

All that she wants (all she wants) all that she wants
All that she wants (all she wants) all that she wants
All that she wants (all she wants) all that she wants

To be clear, I'm not a hater
And my wife, I like her, too
Let's be honest with each other
There's some things we always knew
All that she wants is the sun and the moon
The call of the wild and a big silver spoon
All she wants
Is another little special arrangement
A financial engagement
Social standing is stable
But no kids on the table
Just a little harmless diversion
An acceptable version
But I know my heart is in peril
Made a deal with the devil

All that she wants (all she wants) all that she wants
All that she wants (all she wants) all that she wants
All that she wants (all she wants) all that she wants
Is another son

Oh, it seems I was mistaken
Heaven knows just what I've done
All these hateful conversations
Are not helping anyone
My dear wife I have to leave you
There is nothing you can say
You can keep the house without me
Oh, they're better off this way

Tu dis l'amour c'est pas ça, mais tu vois
J'suis pas l'con que tu crois, cette chanson elle est pour toi

T'as voulu la passion, t'as eu des Mon chéri
T'as voulu l'évasion, j't'ai acheté des kiwis
T'as voulu voir la mer, et on a vu la mienne
Tu dis Rome, je dis Vienne

Parce que j'ai pas envie (non, non, j'ai pas envie)
Qu'on se dit (non, non, j'ai pas envie)
J'ai pas envie (non, non, j'ai pas envie), j'ai pas envie ( non, non, j'ai pas envie)

Where did you go?
I thought I knew you, 
What did I know?
You don't look different, but you have changed.
I'm looking through you, you're not the same. 

Your lips are moving, 
I cannot hear.
Your voice is soothing, 
But the words aren't clear.
You don't sound different, 
I've learned the game.
I'm looking through you, 
You're not the same. 

Why, tell me why, did you not treat me right?
Love has a nasty habit of disappearing overnight. 

You're thinking of me, 
The same old way.
You were above me, 
But not today.
The only difference is you're down there.
I'm looking through you, 
Any other way.

Mika,"When I was a young man courting the girls
I played me a waiting game
If a maid refused me with tossing curls
I'd let the old Earth take a couple of whirls
While I plied her with tears in lieu of pearls
And as time came around she came my way
As time came around, she came

When you meet with the young girls early in the Spring
You court them in song and rhyme
They answer with words and a clover ring
But if you could examine the goods they bring
They have little to offer but the songs they sing
And the plentiful waste of time of day
A plentiful waste of time

Oh, it's a long, long while from May to December
But the days grow short when you reach September
When the autumn weather turns the leaves to flame
One hasn't got time for the waiting game

Oh, the days dwindle down to a precious few
September, November
And these few precious days I'll spend with you
These precious days I'll spend with you","Right Place, Right Time",2004

Running around like a clown on purpose
Who gives a damn about the family you come from?
No givin' up when you?re young and you want some

Running around again
(Running around again)
Running from running

Waking up in the midday sun
What's to live for?
You could see what I've done
Staring at emotion
In the light of day
I was running from the things that you?d say

We are not what you think we are
We are golden, we are golden
We are not what you think we are
We are golden, we are golden

Teenage dreams in a teenage circus
Running around like a clown on purpose
Who gives a damn about the family you come from?
No giving up when you?re young and you want some

Running around again
(Running around again)
Running from running
Running around again
(Running around again)
Running from running

I was a boy at an open door
Why you staring
Do you still think that you know?
Looking for treasure
In the things that you threw
Like a magpie
I live for glitter, not you

We are not what you think we are
We are golden, we are golden
We are not what you think we are
We are golden, we are golden

Teenage dreams in a teenage circus
Running around like a clown on purpose
Who gives a damn about the family you come from?
No giving up when you?re young and you want some

Now I'm sitting alone
I'm finally looking around
Left here on my own
I'm gonna hurt myself
Maybe losing my mind
I'm still wondering why
Had to let the world let it bleed me dry

We are not what you think we are
We are not what you think we are
We are not what you think we are
We are golden, we are golden

Mika Agematsu,"Her name was Lola, she was a showgirl 
With yellow feathers in her hair and a dress cut down to there 
She would merengue and do the cha-cha 
And while she tried to be a star 
Tony always tended bar 
Across the crowded floor, they worked from 8 til 4 
They were young and they had each other 
Who could ask for more? 

At the copa (CO!) Copacabana (Copacabana) 
The hottest spot north of Havana (here) 
At the copa (CO!) Copacabana 
Music and passion were always in fashion 
At the copa they fell in love 

His name was Rico 
He wore a diamond 
He was escorted to his chair, he saw Lola dancing there 
And when she finished,he called her over 
But Rico went a bit to far 
Tony sailed across the bar 
And then the punches flew and chairs were smashed in two 
There was blood and a single gun shot 
But just who shot who? 

At the copa she lost her love 

Her name is Lola, she was a showgirl, 
But that was 30 years ago, when they used to have a show 
Now it's a disco, but not for Lola, 
Still in dress she used to wear, 
Faded feathers in her hair 
She sits there so refined,and drinks herself half-blind 
She lost her youth and she lost her Tony 
Now she's lost her mind 

At the copa don't fall in love 
Don't fall in love",Copacabana,2009

And let it all unfurl into broken remnants
Smile like you mean it and let yourself let go

'Cause it's all in the hands of a bitter, bitter man
Say goodbye to the world you thought you lived in
Take a bow, play the part of a lonely, lonely heart
Say goodbye to the world you thought you lived in
To the world you thought you lived in

I tried to live alone but lonely is so lonely, alone
So human as I am, I had to give up my defenses
So I smiled and tried to mean it to let myself let go

'Cause it's all in the hands of a bitter, bitter man
Say goodbye to the world you thought you lived in
Take a bow, play the part of a lonely, lonely heart
Say goodbye to the world you thought you lived in

When she warn me what people say,
Live your life until love is found,
'cause love's gonna get you down.

Jesus loves her, she wants more,
Oh bad girls get you down.

Too much candy gonna rot your soul,
If she loves you, let her go,
'cause love only gets you down.
Take a look at the boy like me,
Never stood on my own two feet,
Now I'm blue, as I can be,
Oh love couldn't get me down.

Mika Bomb,"You talk about life and talk about death
And everything in between
Like it's nothing and the words are easy

You talk about me and talk about you
And everything I do
Like it's something that needs repeating

I don't need an alibi or for you to realize
The things we left unsaid
Are only taking space up in our head

Make it my fault, win the game
Point the finger, place the blame
And turns me up and down, doesn't matter now

'Cause I don't care if I ever talk to you again
This is not about emotion
I don't need a reason not to care

What you say or what happened in the end
This is my interpretation
And it don't, don't make sense

The first two weeks turn into ten
I hold my breath and wonder when it'll happen
Does it really matter?

If half of what you said is true
And half of what I didn't do could be different
Would it make it better?

If we forget the things we know
Would we have somewhere to go?
The only way is down, I can see that now

'Cause I don't care if I ever talk to you again
This is not about emotion
I don't need a reason not to care

What you say or what happened in the end
This is my interpretation

Your wrinkled eyes betray the joy with which you smile
I care to see my reason, I care to put your life in mine

Lookin' at life from the perspective of a boy
Who's learned to love you but has also learned to grow
Could we make it better, stormy weather?
So hard to know

Oh, oh, oh, is there anybody home?
Who will believe me, won't deceive me
Won't try to change me?

Ah, ah, ah, is there anybody home?
Who wants to have me just to love me?
Stuck in the middle

I look at you, you look at me, we bite each other
And with your bitter words you kick me in the gutter
But my troops are bigger than yours
'Cause you'll never stand my fight

Ours is a family that's based upon tradition
But with my careless words I tread upon your vision
Are five kids better than one? Who doesn't like to be gone?

Oh, oh, oh, is there anybody home?
Who will believe me, won't deceive me
Won't try to change me?

Ah, ah, ah, is there anybody home?
Who wants to have me just to love me?
Stuck in the middle, yeah, yeah, yeah

This is to my name
This ain't a greater plan
To break your heart of me

I know that what I've started
Means that when we have parted
I can live in honesty

Who will believe me, won't deceive me
Won't try to change me?

Mikado,"Un jour d'hiver tu as décidé
De m'emmener dans une maison cachée
Je ne voulais pas t'accompagner
Au bord de cette mer enchantée

Mais tu m'as dit que mes yeux brillaient
Juste comme deux belles pierres oubliées
J'avais écrit ton nom sur le sable
Quand la mer a tout effacé

J'ai roulé dans tes doigts des colliers de varech
Où la nacre et le sel unissaient leur parfum

J'ai surpris ton reflet changeant
Dans les lames de l'océan
Dans l'écho de ta voix sucrée
J'ai bien cru que tout basculait

L'océan emporte ton nom
Au hasard des vents et marées
Dans les brumes de mes pensées
Ton beau visage s'est effacé

J'ai roulé dans tes doigts des colliers de varech
Où la nacre et le sel unissaient leur parfum

Et la lune est venue si vite
Je crois bien que j'ai confondu
Tes cheveux mêlés aux algues mouillées
Tes yeux brûlant l'âme de l'océan

Dans les fonds marins aux sables mouvants
J'ai sombré corps et âme

Mikael,"I can only give you love that lasts forever,
And the promise to be near each time you call,
And the only heart I own is yours and yours alone, that's all, that's all.
I can only give you country walks in springtime,
And a hand to hold when leaves begin to fall,
And a love whose burning light to warm the winter night, that's all, that's all.
There are those I am sure who have told you,
They will give you the world for a toy.
All I ask for these arms to enfold you, and a love, time can never destroy.
If you're wond'ring what I'm asking in return, dear,
You'll be glad to know that my demands are small.
Say it's me that you'll adore for now and ever more, that's all, that's all.",I Miss You,2006
Mikael Åkerfeldt,"(Hello, mirror, so glad to see you, my friend, it's been a while)

Staring at the empty page before me
All the years of wreckage run through my head
Patterns of my live have thawed and torn me
Revealing hurtful shame and deep lament
Overwhelming sorrow now absorbs me
As the pen begins to trace my darkest past
Signs throughout my life that should have warned me
Of all the wrongs I've done for which I must repent

I once thought it better to regret
Things that I have done, then haven't

Sometimes you've got to be wrong
Learn the hard way
Sometimes you've got to be strong
When you think it's too late

Staring at the finished page before me
All the damage now so clear and evident
Thinking 'bout the dreaded task in store for me
A bitter fear at the thought of my amends
Hoping that the step will help restore me
To face my past and ask for forgiveness
Cleaning up my dirty side of this un-swept street
Could this be the beginning of the end?

I once thought it better to regret
Things that I have done, then haven't

Sometimes you've got to be wrong
Learn the hard way
Just when you're through hanging on
You're saved

If we are painstaking about this phase of our development
We will be amazed before we are halfway through.
We are going to know a new freedom and a new happiness.
We will not regret the past nor wish to shut the door on it.
We will comprehend the word serenity, and we will know peace
No matter how far down the scale we have gone.
We will see how our experience can benefit others.
That feeling of uselessness and self-pity will disappear.
We will lose interest in selfish things and gain interest in our fellows.
Self-seeking will slip away.
Our whole attitude and outlook upon life will change.
Fear of people and economic insecurity will leave us.
We will intuitively know how to handle situations which used to baffle us.
We will suddenly realize that God is doing for us what we could not do for ourselves.
Are these extravagant promises? We think not.
They have been fulfilled amongst others
Sometimes quickly, sometimes slowly.
We will always be true to our principles.

You're only as sick as your secrets
But the truth shall set you free.
The truth is the truth.
That's all you can do is live with it.",Repentance,2007
Mikael Augustsson,"I'm hearing images, I'm seeing songs
No poet has ever painted
Voices call out to me, straight to my heart
So strange, yet we're so well acquainted
I let the music speak with no restrains
I let my feelings take over
Carry my soul away, into the world
Where beauty meets the darkness of the day  

Where my mind is like an open window
Where the high and healing winds blow
From my shallow sleep the sounds awake me
I let them take me  

Let it be a joke, let it be a smile
Let it be a farce, if it makes me laugh for a little while
Let it be a tear, let it be a sigh
Coming from a heart, speaking to a heart, let it be a cry  

Some streets are emptiness, dry leaves of autumn
Rustling down an old alley
And in the dead of night, I find myself a blind man
In some ancient valley
I let the music speak, leading me gently
Urging me like a lover
Leading me all the way, into a place
Where beauty will defeat the darkest day  

Where I'm one with every grand illusion
No disturbance, no intrusion
Where I let the wistful sounds seduce me
I let them use me  

Let it be a joke, let it be a smile
Let it be a farce, if it makes me laugh for a little while
Let it be a tear, let it be a sigh
Coming from a heart, speaking to a heart, let it be a cry  

Let it be a tear, let it be a sigh
Coming from a heart, speaking to a heart, let it be a cry  

Let it be the joy of each new sunrise
Or the moment when a day dies
I surrender without reservation
No explanation, no questions why
I take it to me and let it flow through me
Yes, I let the music speak
I let the music speak",I Let the Music Speak,2014
Mikael Augustsson,"I'm nothing special, in fact I'm a bit of a bore
If I tell a joke, you've probably heard it before

I'm so grateful and proud
All I want is to sing it out loud

So I say
Thank you for the music, the songs I'm singing
Thanks for all the joy they're bringing
Who can live without it, I ask in all honesty
What would life be?
Without a song or a dance what are we?
So I say thank you for the music
For giving it to me

Mother says I was a dancer before I could walk
She says I began to sing long before I could talk
But I've often wondered, how did it all start?
Who found out that nothing can capture a heart
Like a melody can?
Well, whoever it was, I'm a fan

I wanna sing it out to everybody

Mut tiedä se et tääl on joku joka rakastaa
Ja tekee mitä vaan sun puolestas, vuosien pääst tai jo heti huomenna

Ser jag skräckbilder tydligast av allt
Ja, de gånger de skrämde eller slog mig
Är de minnen som hårdast sitter fast
För som barn tar man kärleken för given;
Allting annat är mot ens natur
I den stund man tar steget ut i livet
Är man bara ett tillgivet djur

Ändå står snart de vuxna där och pekar
Ut den riktning de tycker man skall ta
Alla drömmar de själva har förvägrats
Vill de förverkliga genom sina barn
Är man lydig belönas man och hyllas
Revolterar man mister man allt
Ingen älskar ett barn som inte lyckas
Ingen älskar ett barn som är starkt

Men vem besitter förmågan att veta
Vad som ryms i en ny individ?
Och vem kan säg' till nån annan hur lyckan ser ut
Vem kan säg' vad nån annan vill bli?

Låt dina blommor slå rot där det finns jordmån
Låt dina växter får leva där de trivs
Lås inte in dina plantor i ett drivhus
Låt de få slippa ett onaturligt liv

Vill du bli respekterad av din avbild
Så får du visa din avbild respekt",Ikaros,2009

Vic Hop Fat Jack and myself Aceyalone

we come for the glory of the be	-boy kingdom
bring them laughter after which bring them tears

i seen it comin' and knew it was a plot
legislation had a plan to kill hip hop
i got wind from a snitch i kept in contact w/this
bitch ass judge who was paid off
soon after that he got laid off
i'm lettin' niggas know you tryin' to stop a muthafucka's flow
hold your black stallions and your black sheeps
black clan aided a nigga and got heat
we met up on Stepney and Market sparked it 
mapped out the target
we gon' take out their number one sergeant
young and strong we bailed up on their front lawn
to kill the enemy
remember me
well if you remember me you'll remember
i'm the one who broke into the pentagon took fouls planted bombs
now i possess the blueprint
i counter the message you sent
no longer will you slander and tamper w/our music
copies of the document we're xeroxed 
the ghetto took offense in defense of hip hop
shot down rolled 'em up loc'ed up bailed out
saved the day 
then into thin air i fade away
scorpion

we come for the glory of the be	-boy kingdom
bring them laughter after which bring them tears

the story had never been told until now
as the glory of the kingdom come comes down
disguised as a janitor the washman
i swept and mopped the floors
better yet i was a spook behind the door
w/a perfect view from the bannister
feeling like Lee Harvey
'cept i got a hundred million years in me
first thing i did was aim
lock him in my scope
squeeze
bust his melon open now i'm pleased 
in the name of MC's
already passed the time that they allotted me
the housekeeper spotted me
it was either her or me
click clack
she says i will not say what i see
but i never could have trusted her so i busted her in her chest
then laughed
then headed for the elevator shaft
but it was too late the jig was up
there was pigs all in the building
so i tried to escape to the fire escape from homicide
yeah i killed him
hangin' from the third story ladder 
i dropped and i felt my ankle shatter
no time to lose juice from my bladder
my mission was completed and that was all that mattered
the van was parked a hundred yards from the scene of the crime
but it was hard to run w/a broken foot
just like i thought they blasted
i took one to the gut
i was laying there thinkin' about death
just watchin' my blood spill out
just then the van pulls up and i jump in
and then we pull out (?lickin'?) shouts for the glory

we come for the glory of the be	-boy kingdom
bring them laughter after which bring them tears

i walk in like a normal black
gun peckin' jaw snatching 
slide
they like the way i glide
to the back break out my backpack and stack my shit up
ah it's bulging now
looked around heard a gun shot
pow
i looked down I whipped out my shit
unloaded my clip
jetting by the count i slipped 
tripped out
landed on my hip crawled out
i hit a tuck and roll up and out
into a flip and boned out now i'm zonin'
I'm nine glocks and seven 380's richer
i'm fit to blow the foundation off this beyotch up
synchronized for the race 
i push the button
nuke the place
timed myself dashin to the ride
i hops inside 
keys already in the ignition
i cranks it slaps it in drive

Cause you don't know but you don't hear me though

And snaps like a wild mongoose in a trap
Better watch your table manners boy and give me room

On the way to the moon w/a stick and a broom
And the cream of the crop hip hop cause we be
Crackin' the whip on the poppin' be pimpin' the whole punk block
At the junk shop

Sloppin' the side of a pig pen with the grape ape baboon
Wanna see this jack o'lantern panted planted ball that don't bounce
Against the wall like you think
Well thanks but no thanks
Pranks or no pranks
I'm a let 'em know they can't rank bank or no bank

But I'll put you up on this here cause you's not knowin'

Damn Acey flay me he kinda hittin' I ain't bullshittin'
Written into the Fellowship you know freestyle

Immediately exceeding the reality of normality
By radically and automatically startin' off rapidly
Rap w/me
Come on perk a little work a little
In the middle nuclei we are responding
Stimuli dim the lights
I gotta really grab you
Cause you just not knowin' about flowin' I can climax to
You rap too short too long too slow too fast
You lacks on point you wrong you won't last
I'm up on a good foot you're out on a bad note
I'm dope

Automatic oh yes
Creatively talkin' about how I'm fadin' you vocally

Rap dude ain't nobody fade the fresh coast
You know them Heavyweights you know what I'm sayin'
That Ganja K you know what I'm sayin'
That Dolla Holla comin' w/that Watts up you know what I'm sayin'
It's like I ain't even tryin' to understand why people comin' at me
W/that nonsense
They ain't knowin'

See I engineered it I geared it I steered it
I took it to the whole world and everybody cheered it
I hauled it I yes y'all'ed it and they feared it
I called it I outlawed it and they cleared it
Now I am I and it is it and that's that
But ain't that a bitch
It ain't shit
Think it ain't all that that they say
Forever and a day
To live and die in L.A
California u.s.a
But I am a universal soldier
Ok
Walkin' through the party tryin' to find my way
Bumped into my main man Ganjah K
I gave a nigga a pound and he lit up a j
I took a hit and a half and got high and a hey
My coconut was mellow but my vision was gray
Looked on the dance floor and I seen my DJ
Cool hands Kiilu Grand he knows what to play
So we headed for the booth to get the party on the way
Walkin' through the crowd I heard somebody say hey
It was Mikah 9 he said what up double A
Tryin' to make my pay tryin' not to stray
But you know my forte I let a sleepin' dog lay

We on that old missin' link
In between the baboon and the common man
They don't understand tho
They ain't even tryin' to know

I and I echo with old sentiments
Rudimentary tenements
House reverberates
Richochets to small invertebrates

Rhyme-less bass with no taste jazz
Enthusiastic spastic hemophiliacs
Memorabilia or acting siliac sense(less)milia
Minature expenditures
Spine tingling adventures
Keenly architechtures
Of a lecture
That blockade and bust dental caps and dentures
Hey! let's start a new business venture
No you're not dreaming i'll be the Pincher
The millimeter by millimeter Doberman Bull Mastiff mix
Where Rottweiler while a rhyme of
Graffiti traffic autobiographic
Ethnic cleansing benzing lacing
Culture oscars inch by inch Deans and Costners
Who foster my rhythmic memories
Collectible sacks of my Mossberg and telebeam
Scope enemies with enemas
I'm leaving them helpless and hopeless like the
Running victim that falls in the scary cinema

Huh huh it was like three black guys and they like had skills
Yeah skills
They were like kinda kinda funky and fresh and stuff

Yeah nigga you just not knowin'",Knownots,1995
Mikah 9,"Aceyalone:
It's not a problem that I can't fix
'cause I can do it with my bag of tricks
they're playing for keeps and for kicks
but they're building with popsicle sticks instead of bricks
the time ticks, the atmosphere gets thick
I breathe in, it makes me sick to my stomach
if you got any kind of fix I want it
sometimes I think the attic's haunted
but it's not, it's just me
so I keep strutting and keep pushing my buttons
but I'm not about to be pushed over the edge
I made this pledge
not by you, my brother or by Sister Sledge
now I know that I'm not your boss
and I'm not trying to floss or come across lost
I wipe the frost until the glass is clear
and I exhaust the possibilities of showing fear
'cause the bigger the scare, the heavier the tear
and the wetter the drop and then you flood the crops
and we just don't want to be flooded
we cut it when we can't cut it we strutted we stay budded up
we keep it up and cut it up until we gotta shut up

Chorus (x2):
Haiku De Tat, make my music for the people who want to get down

Abstract Rude:
It ain't a lunch time I like to miss
I ain't a punch line type lyricist
and if you had beef you'd fight with your fists
my people suffer from lack of knowledge and righteousness
streets so wild we developed a frown
and a keen sense for knowing when it's going down
play it cool
say some shit that surprise me, my face don't change
serious 'bout them chips like a poker game
I come frequently like these Oakland trains
I freestyled it in a show and never wrote it the same
Aaron Pointer came to reign and say something
Eddie Hayes stays a little ways from me
the west side combination is legendary
home studios, cause by any means necessary
completed projects is my productivity
gimme food smoke and electricity
and if the power is ever cut off
I got a generator up in the loft
to stay energized, my music finds a way
to survive through the times and with the kinds today
L.A., what a wild place to be
styles by Ab, Mike Troy, and A.C.E.

Chorus

Mikah 9:
Indeed, indeed, Haiku De Tat what we could do witcha'
men at peace for y'all to call entities 
quicker on the draw the sickest thing that you ever saw
so for all our trees grow and grows in my backyard
remember me, sometimes I like to act hard
that's just it, it's an act but don't confuse that
if you choose to chit chat with a mack fully packed
you're bruised, black, blue and blurple
you'd never get a chance to bust back
I don't have to be rappin' or dancin' in a circle
to make the people react
I could be enjoying the be	-boying
I'm already on the map and made my money living fat
no need to profile and flash stacks
I'm way past that
Master Card and a little cash for snacks
munchies, after partaking from breaking nugs
down out of fat bud stash stacks
ahh, I do my floor work on linoleum
exploring the crevices of my woman's ass crack
I rhymin' in the SF studio on Napoleon
and I really love this jazz track
I'm running game now I'mma win
I'm on my last lap
you want to dance with me?
fast tap chance jacking for ASCAPs, checks, advance
and that's wack, I mash back

Come fast
Come slow
But got no range like us
If you put Haiku D'Etat

Six in the morning
Po-po at they door
But they ain't gone get them
'Cause they got a window
All exits not seized
So they fled

Find personal seeds
Grows no more
Than a OZ rastas indeed
Snitched on by some neighbor
Smelling the weed

For we quickly dismiss from duty

The mothership ain't leaving us
These trees we puff
Stimuate I
Rieation we believe
In love receive enough
Positive vibrations
To achieve
The trust
And make gees

And there is reason
I'm born in babylon
Under the odd star
And where they plot war
But we doo not want war
Unless pushed upon
And then brains will bust
But we do not like that
So we give peace
And love

Who's gonna do me?
The black and white
Or my look a like
It's looking like
It ain't looking too good
So I looked where I stood
Then I looked up
What a wonderful world
To have at my disposal
And those who know
If you abuse it
Then you lose it
But who's is it to begin with?
We started god-like
Now what's it gonna end with?
And we won't stop there

open up your ears and what appears it's something true and clear
and I hear transprojection is love metaphysically here it is
I'll keep it in my soul, so I will show no fear were transmitted
I'm loud and clear as for those who see the light
behind the rhymes of Mikah 9 they know the time
And I see you and you make it through some of you don't hear me
All I can say is it's all love and that's the way it gotta be
Must we rob, rape, and murder one another for eternity?
As concerned to me
I would much rather we try to help each other
Allthe way down the road but almost every time I turn around
I hear the sound of bullet rounds fly through air
I'm well aware we're not prepared to
have conversation with celestial anatomy 
of Hereon and day by day we study in astronomy
and converse in astrology and Hereon
Live my days so let's partake so let's all take flight

and all of those spy satellites

Need veggies
For your bone support
Be ready for Armageddon
Hold the fort down
Go through the court trial
Get acquitted
Be committed
To the sacrifice
It's a lotta pie
Ab get a slice

[Chorus]

And tell me how bad you want it
And tell me how much of it's greed
Forgetting the things that you want
Versus getting the things that you need
And tell me how bad do you want it
And tell me mow much of it's greed
Forgetting the things that you want
Versus getting the things that you need

Right about now
A nigga Drunk
Been smoking
Some ole janky
Rolled stress blunts
I want skunk
I really want my baby momma cunt
She kick it with punks
When I know a family man
What she want
Bitch made niggas
On the rag
Every month
I should just punt fools
Like footballs
My goals to make you look
Yo I could call some stunts
From porno industries
Or get some from
In the streets
Shady heat
That's meant for me
But what I want
And what I need
Should be about me
And my seeds
'Cause sometimes
I have flashbacks
Of chopping crack
And weed
Moving X and LSD
Having sex
With more than three
Busting checks
For fifty gees
Cashing checks
And pushing keys
Vexed and connects
With the greed
I process
Take the Rolex off your wrist
Take the Rolodex off your desk
But in the long run
I'm a strong son
Those klepto days done
My life reflects
Universal
'Cause and effect
In every action
I'm sorry my karma
Ran over your dogma
Loved one
Don't be upset
We can still pop a bottle
Then we can get lit up and wet
The common ground
Is the love
We all express
Whoever got a problem
With that
Deserves what they get!

[Chorus]

Forgetting the things that you want
Versus getting the things that you need
And tell me how bad do you want it
And tell me how much of it's greed
Forgetting the things that you want
Versus getting the things that you need

Man
I want money
I need food
I want clothes
I need housing
I want cars
I need good health
I need knowledge of self
I got knowledge of self
I want peace
But I need help
I want to do right
But I need the mic
I want wings
But they gave me a bike
I need light
I want the blacks to know
They need the facts
I want a Cadillac
But I need tracks
To make stacks
I want a million in the bank
And a pound of dank
But I need to think
'Cause I could sink
And get caught up
In the funk stank
I want to pull rank
But I need to be a saint
And so I need a prayer
And after that
I need a drink
'Cause I want to be
Wanted need
To be needed
But I want to stay blunted
And need to be weeded
For my own goodness sake
I want to escape
But I need to set you straight
So tell me how bad do you want it
Punk
And tell me
How much of it's greed
Versus
Getting the things that you want
Pumpkin
Or getting the things that you need
Sucker

I gotta go, get away
How I feel about you makes me wonder
If our love is true
You want to go, all the way
Could you wait a little bit longer
Cause I'm saving all my love because of you

Finally I found it
Someone that I really care about
Baby I believe that you're the one
Now I understand it
That I want you without a doubt
But now I gotta take some time alone

It's the beginning not the end
I'll be there for you time and time again

An emptiness that I've never known

How do you leave it in a drawer

Now here it comes
The hardest part of all
Unchain my heart that's holding on
How do I start to live my life alone
Guess I'm just learning
Learning the art of letting go

Try to say it's over
Say the word goodbye
But each time it catches in my throat
You're still here in me
And I can't set you free
So I hold on to what I wanted most
Baby someday we'll be friends forever more
Wish I could open up that door

Now here it comes
The hardest part of all
Unchain my heart that's holding on
How do I start to live my life alone
Guess I'm just learning
Learning the art of letting go

Watching us fade
What can I do
But try to make it through the pain
Not one more day without you
Where do I start to live my life alone
I guess I'm learning
Only learning
Learning the art of letting go",The Art of Letting Go,2001

And am I wrong?

Good god, just a little bit, just a little bit goes a long way
Just a little bit, just a little bit goes a long way
Faith is just a lover I don’t own
Love is just an answer I don’t know

Tell myself I’m better off alone
But I’ve been at the bottom for a long time
I’ve been asking you to hold my hand, to bend it back
And take me down to let me know you’re gone
And stop waiting for you

Good god, just a little bit, just a little bit goes a long way
Just a little bit, just a little bit goes a long way

I hear the song, I wanna sing along with you
But when I try, I’m out of tune, I turn and walk away

Trying to show you through
I want you to see it my way

I fear the fight that I’m about to fight for you, girl
'Cause it’s a side, a sight of me I’ve yet to see
And when I’m down, broke, battered, bruised, won’t turn and walk away

'Cause I’m dying to get along with you
Trying to show you through
I want you to see it my way

And so I tried, I’m in a hole, am I a different man?

Do I shout it out, do I let it go?
Do I need to know what I'm waiting for?
Oh no, I want it now, do I need it now?
Shit goes on and on and on and on and on

I'm pretty good at making things out of the scene
And turning problems back to me
It's not the way I want to be
But I've been thinking about the time you came around
You took my head up off the ground
Now that's a place I want to be

That's the way the business go

How this shit would end up like would end up after the show
By the way you smoke without a day
Got caught up on the highway

They weren't trying to hear what I had to say
I said these cops wouldn't let him go, we don't move no snow
I don't see what they see reason takes, my new tour
Search for us, never let us go
Cause he didn't find what he was looking for
Situation could of gotten out of control
But we made it through now it's time to roll
State to state to state we make so much of this hate

Say boo you know it's real if you don't come home
When I call your phone ain't no plex in my tone
Hold this shit down leave your plex at home
Ain't bugging ain't tripping put you in the sex zone
When you hit the streets I know you giving them hell
Hit the studio make your pockets swell

I'm down with my nigga we gone forever last
You chose me I chose you I ain't worried about no hoes
Got my name in your mouth don't let your mouth fall low
To a diamond baby, now go on and shine
I be here I'm you not so uh, smile for me now

Know what I'm saying boo, I ain't really tripping on you
Just keep it real with me, you a real nigga and all

And boyfriends on the coast
And a friend
Who's just a casual thing

That nobody loves you like I do

Nobody, baby
Nobody loves you like I do

I wish you'd tell me where I went wrong
How could you walk out on me?
Now, all I have are these telephone calls
Where I never say exactly how I feel
Nobody loves you like I do

Well, there's never been a moment
Since the day you walked out
That I haven't felt
The pain of losing you

But every time you call me
I just say that I'm alright
I never let the loneliness
Shine through

But if you ever get the feeling
That you want to settle down
Just call out my name and I'll be around
Oh, nobody loves you like I do

Nobody, baby, nobody loves you like I do
Nobody, nobody loves you like I do
No, no, no, no, no, nobody
Nobody can do the the dirt like I do

""It seems to me you learned it on the way,
You lived by tricks and lies;
Standing around in your juggler's gown,
There seems no reason why;

Flashing your eyes and casting spells
With candles and signs and magic bells,
Oh, you are the fool, not I.""
Imbecile, you can call me that if you feel the need,

But life is short and I am living it while I can.
If it rains, I'll get wet but in the sunshine I'll be dry,

""And both of us are wrong,
For though we walk this road we don't know where it leads,
We only know it's long.

And I can learn from you;
You with your jokes and simple plans
And me with my tricks and sleight of hands,

Together we could get through.""

Searching in forests of feathers and snow.
Travelling through valleys of secrets and tears,
Where only the brave or the foolish would go.
Watching for signs in an empty sky,
We never thought that the rain would fall,
As the years went by.

""Just the place for a Snark!"" the Bellman cried
As he landed his crew with care;
Supporting each man on the top of the tide
By a finger entwined in his hair.

The Bellman himself they all praised to the skies -
Such a carriage, such ease and such grace!
Such solemnity, too! One could see he was wise,
The moment one looked in his face!

But the danger was past - they had landed at last,
With their boxes, portmanteaus, and bags:
Yet at first sight the crew were not pleased with the view,
Which consisted of chasms and crags.

He served out some grog with a liberal hand,
And bade them sit down on the beach:
And they could not but own that their Captain looked grand,
As he stood and delivered his speech.

Mike Batt,"Some enchanted evening, you may see a stranger,
You may see a stranger across a crowded room,
And somehow you know, you know even then,
That somehow you'll see here again and again.

Some enchanted evening, someone may be laughing,
You may hear her laughing across a crowded room,
And night after night, as strange as it seems,
The sound of her laughter will sing in your dreams.

Who can explain it, who can tell you why?
Fools give you reasons, wise men never try.

Some enchanted evening, when you find your true love,
When you hear her call you across a crowded room,
Then fly to her side and make her your own,
Or all through your life you may dream all alone.

Once you have found her, never let her go,
Once you have found her, never let her go.",Some Enchanted Evening [From South Pacific],1989

Mike Batt,"The summer sun is fading as the year grows old
And darker days are drawing near
The winter winds will be much colder
Now you're not here.
I watch the birds fly south across the autumn sky
And one by one they disappear.
I wish that I was flying with them
Now you're not here

Like a song through the trees you came to love me
Like a leaf on a breeze you blew away

Through autumn's golden gown we used to kick our way
You always loved this time of year.
Those fallen leaves lie undisturbed now
Cause you're not here

Like a song through the trees you came to love me
Like a leaf on a breeze you blew away

A gentle rain falls softly on my weary eyes
As if to hide a lonely tear
My life will be forever autumn
'Cause you're not here!",Forever Autumn,1994

It ran one step ahead 
As we followed in the dance 
Between the parted pages and were pressed

All the sweet, green icing flowing down 
Someone left the cake out in the rain 
I don't think that I can take it 
'Cause it took too long to bake it 
And I'll never have that recipe again 
Oh, no! 

I still see the yellow cotton dress 
Foaming like a wave 
On the ground around your knees 
And the birds, like tender babies in your hands 
And the old men playing checkers by the trees 

MacArthur's Park is melting in the dark 
All the sweet, green icing flowing down 
Someone left the cake out in the rain 
I don't think that I can take it 
'Cause it took so long to bake it 
And I'll never have that recipe again 
Oh, no! 

There will be another song for me 
For I will sing it 
There will be another dream for me 
Someone will bring it 
I will drink the wine while it is warm 
And never let you catch me looking at the sun 
And after all the loves of my life 
After all the loves of my life 
You'll still be the one 

I will take my life into my hands and I will use it 
I will win the worship in their eyes and I will lose it 
I will have the things that I desire 
And my passion flow like rivers and the sky 
And after all the loves of my life 
After all the love of my life 
You still be the one
You keep wondering wanna know why

They say I'm a man of the world
I've flown across every tide
And I've seen lots of pretty girls

I guess I've got everything I need
I wouldn't ask for more
And there's no one I'd rather be
But I just wish that I'd never been born

And I need a good woman
To make me feel like a good man should
I don't say I'm a good man
Oh, but I would be if I could

And how I wish I was in love",Man of the World,1994
Mike Batt,"We went to the room and we bolted the door,
The bass from the jukebox was coming through the floor,
And out through the walls we could still hear the roar of the trains.
Was this all the comfort we got for our sins?
No candles, no waiters, no soft violins?
A dirty electric convector plugged into the mains.

I had wanted much more for the first night with you,
But the railway hotel was the best I could do.
I knew the Savoy would have suited you well,
But the best I could do was the railway hotel.

Away in the sky were the lights of a jet,
Burning in the night like a slow cigarette.
The lamp in the street threw a soft silhouette on the wall.
And though it was crumbling and rundown and dead
A chair and a sink and an old single bed,
The love we began and the things that we said, I recall.

Parsley, sage, rosemary and thyme
Remember me to one who lives there
For once she was a true love of mine

Have her make me a cambric shirt
Parsley, sage, rosemary and thyme
Without no seam nor fine needle work
And then she'll be a true love of mine

Tell her to weave it in a sycamore wood lane
Parsley, sage, rosemary and thyme
And gather it all with a basket of flowers
And then she'll be a true love of mine

Have her wash it in yonder dry well
Parsley, sage, rosemary and thyme
where water ne'er sprung nor drop of rain fell
And then she'll be a true love of mine

Have her find me an acre of land
Parsley, sage, rosemary and thyme
Between the sea foam and over the sand
And then she'll be a true love of mine

Plow the land with the horn of a lamb
Parsley, sage, rosemary and thyme
Then sow some seeds from north of the dam
And then she'll be a true love of mine

Tell her to reap it with a sickle of leather
Parsley, sage, rosemary and thyme
And gather it all in a bunch of heather
And then she'll be a true love of mine

If she tells me she can't, I'll reply

Let me know that at least she will try
And then she'll be a true love of mine

Though not more than any heart asks
And I must know she's a true love of mine

Because I tell a joke or two
Although I might be laughing loud and hearty

Mike Batt,"Starry, starry night
Paint your palette blue and gray
Look out on a summer's day
With eyes that know the darkness in my soul

Shadows on the hills
Sketch the trees and the daffodils
Catch the breeze and the winter chills
In colors on the snowy linen land

And now I understand
What you tried to say to me
How you suffered for your sanity
How you tried to set them free
They would not listen, they did not know how
Perhaps they'll listen now

Starry, starry night
Flaming flowers that brightly blaze
Swirling clouds in violet haze
Reflect in Vincent's eyes of China blue

Colors changing hue
Morning fields of amber grain
Weathered faces lined in pain
Are soothed beneath the artist's loving hand

And now I understand
What you tried to say to me
How you suffered for your sanity
How you tried to set them free
They would not listen, they did not know how
Perhaps they'll listen now

For they could not love you
But still your love was true
And when no hope was left inside
On that starry, starry night

You took your life as lovers often do
But I could have told you Vincent
This world was never meant for one as
Beautiful as you

Starry, starry night
Portraits hang in empty halls
Frame less heads on nameless walls
With eyes that watch the world and can't forget

Like the strangers that you've met
The ragged men in ragged clothes
The silver thorn of bloody rose
Lie crushed and broken on the virgin snow

And now I think I know
What you tried to say to me
How you suffered for your sanity
How you tried to set them free
They would not listen, they're not listening still
Perhaps they never will

",Vincent,1994

But I knew you were out of reach and it seemed the sun was shining just to remind me.

The way my broken heart is hurting me

If I wait for cloudy skies
You won't know the rain from the tears in my eyes
You'll never know that I still love you
So though the heartaches remain
I'll do my crying in the rain

Raindrops falling from heaven
Will never wash away my misery
But since we're not together
I'll wait for stormy weather
To hide these tears I hope you'll never see

Someday when my crying's done
I'm gonna wear a smile and walk in the sun
I may be a fool
But till then, darling, you'll never see me complain
I'll do my crying in the rain
I'll do my crying in the rain

Mike Boogie,"Yo
My crew is in the house
Terra, Herb McGruff, Buddah Bless
Big Twan, Killa Cam, Trooper J, and Mike Boogie
And I'mma set it like this

Aiyo, folks who quote what I wrote get choked
You better surrender before you get smoked
You niggas be thinkin this kid is a joke?
I put chumps to rest fast, when my Smith-Wes' blast
So just dash or trespass and get your chest smashed
Rap New York rules, I sport jewels and extort crews
Don't get me pissed, I got a short fuse
I go bezerk when I put in work or do dirt, jerk
So stay alert, no smirk, cause these knuckles hurt
I'm from the alley, not the valley
I'm hotter than Cali, wicked like Harry
And fuck Sally, I rather marry Halle
I revive crowds with live styles
Don't hang with jive pals
Adios, ghost, I'm 5 thous'

Well, I'm flav, and I was down with the crime wave
Now it's time saved, yo, cause now I'm a rhyme slave
In '87 I sold cracks, collected some dough stacks
Hold gats, a joker got his soul taxed
Innovated, rappers you know who made it
Tell the Terra to rotate it, his raps are gold-plated
This nigga Terra is past butter, sharp like a glass cutter
Ass brother, I leave your rhyme trash gutter
I'm more rare, the MC in this warfare
Put you in a morgue where it's too late for that Lord prayer
Power struck, Terra drops the follow-up
Sour luck, niggas got and popped and swallow nuts

For those that don't know, yo, I'm Herb McGruff
I'm on some murder stuff
And when I talk every verb is rough
Front on this and get beat bad
With big bats that bruise, break bones
Then wind up bloody in a bodybag
MC's are live, but I'm mad liver
Aiyo, my rhymes are more funky than a African cab driver
Step to this and get sliced with ease
Ate up like rice and peas
(Herb, can you fight?) Yo, I'm nice with these
Ask the nigga in my last bout
He thought I just was on some gun shit, I had to knock his ass out
Microphones I gotta tear
Peace to Big L, straight from hell
I'm the fuck up outta here

Aiyo, it's time to get drastic, but God bless the fantastic
Herb passed it, now I melt the mic like it's plastic
I rag crews cause I'm bad news
In a mad mood I'm serving brothers quicker than fast food
Step to this and get your body blown
Cause I'm no maricon, for poems I slide the hotties home
Here's some advice, I'm mad nice
Aiyo, I'm quick to lick the mag twice
And cold take a fag's life
My swellin melon got niggas jealin
Aiyo, fuck bribes, I'm takin niggas lives like a felon

Yo, I bust chumps like a Glock 10, when I drops in
The top ten is rocked when it's locked in
I just abuse the flow, don't need a fuse to blow
Bruise the groove slow, when I rhyme I just kill the show
I got lines that's deeper than a jail
Been no frail, kids get nailed and read braille when they fail
Yeah, ain't I nasty, too nasty to trash me
Bash me, aiyo, that's dead, so don't ask me
You'd get bumped off if beef ever jumped off
I never come soft, I gotta pump that sawed-off
And when I let slugs out, you will get rugged out
For dissin, you come up missing like a cub scout

Rappers be funny like Flex, cause they section's 80 slaughter, son
Talk about nines and tecs, and never shot a watergun
But Killa Kam, I get erratic when it comes to static
There you have it, a trigger fanatic with a automatic
Increase the peace that cease cause once I release
My crew from the east, we leavin at least
20 police deceased, it's the beast on attack
So make tracks, I break backs
I jack with def gats and black macs
On Lenox Ave. ain't no light looks, you fight crooks
Left and right hooks, if you front, get your life took

I'm havin nail-sharp pains in my brain like a hellraiser
I'm blazin trails from jail cells, so a trailblazer
Who find crime and fill the nine with nothin but lead
Boom-bye-bye, dem find another batty bwoy dead
In backyard alleys, but I call em crackyard valleys
And I pack more rallies than riots back in Cali
And people wanna know the reason why I blow my fuse
I'm in a daze and I'm so confused
From seein heads shake so many times the lead make
And Mike Boogie's next up, and keep my head straight

I should never rhyme cause every time I step into a contest
Kids evacuate the premises like it's a bomb threat
Cause they know when I start droppin' poems
That I be knockin' domes, poppin' bones and sendin' niggas hoppin' home
Word to God, it's kinda hard for a fag to touch this
So if you're come to see me, nigga, bring a cast and crutches
And niggas, I dont' need a gun for you, none of you
Cause I can kill you dead with the lead from my Number 2
And it's death in every paragraph
And niggas learn when I burn their muthafuckin' ass to ash
No need to question am I nice, cause it's a fact, friend
I shoot the gift like Santa Claus with a Mac-10
And niggas ain't half as nice, so they get sacrificed
And sent to the afterlife, they ain't no match for Mike
Now I'm bout to skate in a rush, just finished makin' it tough
Peace to Big L, ayo, 8 is enough

True, true
And before I get up outta here
I gotta say peace to D-Whiz and Short Man
Brothers that was there since the beginning
What's up to Rock-N-Will from the Hard Pack Crew
Peace to Mase Murder and the B.B.O. Crew
The Best Out Crew, the M&M Crew
And all the other crews that's representin in Harlem
You know what I'm sayin?
And last but not least
I gotta say peace to the 139th Street NFL Crew
My crew

And so I face the final curtain
My friend, I'll say it clear
I'll state my case, of which I'm certain

I've lived a life that's full
I've traveled each and every highway
Oh, and more, much more than this
I did it my way

Regrets, I've had a few
But then again, too few to mention
I did what I had to do
And saw it through without exemption

I planned each charted course
Each careful step along the byway
But more, much more than this
I did it my way

Yes, there were times, I'm sure you knew
When I bit off more than I could chew
But through it all, when there was doubt
I ate it up and spit it out
I faced it all and I stood tall
And did it my way

I've loved, I've laughed and cried
Had my fill, my share of losing
And now, as tears subside
I find it all so amusing

To think I did all that
And may I say, not in a shy way
""Oh no, oh no not me
I did it my way""

If not himself, then he has naught

Every mornin' at the mine you could see him arrive
He stood six-foot-six and weighed two-forty-five
Kinda broad at the shoulder and narrow at the hip
And everybody knew ya didn't give no lip to big John
(Big John, big John)
Big bad John (big John)

Nobody seemed to know where John called home
He just drifted into town and stayed all alone
He didn't say much, kinda quiet and shy
And if you spoke at all, you just said hi to Big John

Somebody said he came from New Orleans
Where he got in a fight over a Cajun Queen
And a crashin' blow from a huge right hand
Sent a Louisiana fellow to the promised land, big John
(Big John, big John)
Big bad John (big John)

Then came the day at the bottom of the mine
When a timber cracked and men started cryin'
Miners were prayin' and hearts beat fast
And everybody thought that they'd breathed their last, 'cept John

Through the dust and the smoke of this man-made hell
Walked a giant of a man that the miners knew well
Grabbed a saggin' timber, gave out with a groan
And like a giant oak tree he just stood there alone, big John
(Big John, big John)
Big bad John (big John)

And with all of his strength he gave a mighty shove
Then a miner yelled out ""there's a light up above!""
And twenty men scrambled from a would-be grave
Now there's only one left down there to save, big John

With jacks and timbers they started back down
Then came that rumble way down in the ground
And then smoke and gas belched out of that mine
Everybody knew it was the end of the line for big John
(Big John, big John)

They just placed a marble stand in front of it

Mike Brignardello,"While resting the other evening by the side of the road
I saw an old farmer in the field that he just hold
His face was all brown and wrinkled by the sun and the wind
And he was talking to the Lord just like he'd be talking to a friend

Well he said with his voice calm and quiet
Them corn tassels need sucking I got no strength to tie it
Had no rain in so long that the fields are mighty dusty
And it's been so unbearable hot that the kids were even gettin' fussy

Now that grass down and the pasture it should be knee high
If we could just have a little shower Lord it might keep the calf from going dry
Oh but listen to me talking you'd think I wasn't grateful
Why if you didn't know me so well Lord you'd think I was down right hateful

You'd think I forgot about that new calf that you sent
And the money in the mail that took care of the rent
Mama's cough's better and Johnny's home from the navy
And that good Sunday dinner of hot chicken and dumplings and gravy

And that new preacher you sent us Lord he's sure a fine young man
Why he's just convertin' them sinners to beat the man
Well I guess I'll mosey on home now Lord I won't take no more your time
I guess there's plenty folks here about waitin' to ring your line

Evening to you Lord and watch us over tonight
Don't you worry about us now Lord cause everything is gonna be all right",The Farmer and the Lord,1999
Mike Brignardello,"(God put a song in the heart of an angel and softly she sang it to me)
I get to thinkin' lotta times about when I was a lad 
Of the old home place where I grew up of the days both good and bad 
My overalls were hand-me-downs shoes full of holes 
I used to walk four miles to school every day through the rain the sleet and the cold
I've seen the nights when my daddy would cry 
For the things that his family would need
But all he ever got was a badland farm and seven hungry mouths to feed
And yet and somehow our homefire never flickered once
Cause when all the things went wrong
Mama took the hymn book down and mama sang a song
(What a friend we have in Jesus)
I've been rocked to sleep many a night to the tune of What a Friend
Morning come Rock of Ages it gently wake me once again
Then daddy'd reach up and take the Bible down and he'd read it
Read it loud and strong
And I always felt that maybe our home was blessed
When daddy'd say mama sing a song
Sister left home first I guess then Bob and Tommy and Dan
By then dad's hair was turning grey and I had to be mama's little man
But it seemed that when dad grew weak mom's faith grew strong
And I think those were the greatest days of all when mama sang a song
(Rock of ages cleft for me let me hide myself in Thee)
I guess the old house is still standin' I don't go back much anymore
No voice is left to fill those halls no steps to grace the floor
For you see mama sings in heaven now round God's golden throne
But I'll always believe that this old world is a whole lot better place
Because one time my mama sang a song (precious mem'ries flood my soul)",Mama Sang a Song,1999
Mike Brignardello,"The General just gave me a medal oh I'm a sight for mom to see
But when the news gets round that I ain't got ole Bill
Some kids gonna think a whole lot less of me
You see she gave me that puppy and said he'd protect me through the night

And if I got hurt he'd go for help or he'd back me up in a fight
He growed all the while I was trainin' forget him I never will
'Cause you'd never see me with right at my heels was Oklahoma Bill
We hit a long ridge one sunup and it seemed like death held all the cards

'Cause we payed and payed with lives of men for every hard fought yard
When finally we drove up to the top there wasn't nothin' but death behind
And as we all dug in we all thanked God though we numbered only nine
And as the snipers switched their guns as darkness closed that hill

My soul companion in the night was Oklahoma Bill
There's no glory in a battle once you've seen its awful cost
But there's glory in the knowledge that your flag is never lost
And yet in the stillness of the nightime and all alone you hold a post

You start cryin' like a baby sittin' there with all the ghosts
You feel your buddies are pattin' your back though their guns're silent and still
It's only a dog tryin' to love you my Oklahoma Bill
I gave my note to the Colonel and I bound a shattered leg

And I said Bill we're sure in trouble he never whimpered or begged
I could tell he hated to leave me I was the only God he ever knew
But quick as a flash he took of through the night like a fightin' marine would do
I kept firin' till help finally came it was him though that saved that hill

A dyin' dog had got through the lines my Oklahoma Bill
That little ol' kid will always wonder what happened to her dog
But she'll find out on Judgement Day when she sees the big Skipper's log
We'll all walk in and bugles'll blow and we'll stand our last revue

And men who've died for men on earth will get their heavenly dues
And if all brave hearts are there that day I'll get my greatest thrill
When I hang this medal around the neck of Oklahoma Bill",Oklahoma Bill,1999
Mike Brignardello,"Well I woke up Sunday morning
With no way to hold my head
That didn't hurt
And the beer I had for breakfast wasn't
Bad so I had one more for dessert

Then I fumbled through my closet
For my clothes
And found my cleanest dirty shirt
And I shaved my face
And combed my hair
And stumbled down the stairs
To meet the day

I'd smoked my brain the night before
With cigarettes and songs
That I've been pickin'
But I lit my first and watched a small kid
Cussin' at a can that he was kickin

Then I crossed the empty street and
Caught the sunday smell
Of someone fryin chicken
And it took me back to something
That I'd lost somehow
Somewhere along the way

On the sunday morning sidewalk
Wishing lord that I was stoned
Cause there's something in a sunday
That makes a body feel alone
And there's nothing short of dying
Half as lonesome as the sound
On the sleeping city sidewalk
Sunday morning coming down

In the park I saw a daddy
With a laughing little girl
He was swingin
And I stopped beside the Sunday school
And listened to the song
That they were singing

Then I headed back for home
And somewhere far away
A lonely bell was ringing
And it echoed thru the canyon like
The disappearing dreams of yesterday

On the sunday morning sidewalk
Wishing lord that I was stoned
Cause therels something in a sunday
That makes a body feel alone
And there's nothing short of dying
Half as lonesome as the sound

And the auctioneer felt it was hardly worth his while,
To waste much time on the old violin but he held it up with a smile,
Well it sure ain't much but its all we got left I guess we aught to sell it to,
Oh, now who'll start the bid on this old violin?
Just one more and we'll be through.

And then he cried one give me one dollar,
Who'll make it two only two dollars who'll make it three,
Three dollars twice now that's a good price,
Now who's gonna bid for me?
Raise up your hand now don't wait any longer the auctions about to end,
Who's got four Just one dollar more to bid on this old violin?

Well the air was hot and the people stood around as the sun was setting low,
From the back of the crowd a gray haired man,
Came forward and picked up the bow,
He wiped the dust from the old violin then he tightened up the strings,
Then he played out a melody pure and sweet, sweeter than the Angels sing, 
And then the music stopped and the auctioneer, 
With a voice that was quiet and low he said now what am I bid,
For this old violin and he held it up with a bow.

And then he cried out one give me one thousand,
Who'll make it two only two thousand who'll make it three,
Three thousand twice you know that's a good price,
Common who's gonna to bid for me?
And the people cried out what made the change we don't understand,
Then the auctioneer stopped and he said with a smile,
It was the touch of the Master's hand.

You know threes many a man with his life out of tune,
Battered and scared with sin and he's auctioned cheap,
To a thankless world much like that old violin,
Oh, but then the Master comes,
And that old foolish crowd they never understand,
The worth of a soul and the change that is rought,
Just by one touch of the Masters hand.

And then he cried out one give me one thousand,

Mike Candys,"Deep in the bosom of the gentle night
Is when I search for the light
Pick up my pen and start to write
I struggle, fight dark forces
In the clear moon light
Without fear, insomnia
I can't get no sleep

I used to worry, thought I was goin' mad in a hurry
Gettin' stress, makin' excess mess in darkness
No electricity, something's all over me, greasy
Insomnia please release me and let me dream of
Makin' mad love to my girl on the heath
Tearin' off tights with my teeth
But there's no release, no peace
I toss and turn without cease
Like a curse, open my eyes and rise like yeast
At least a couple of weeks
Since I last slept, kept takin' sleepers
But now I keep myself pepped
Deeper still, that night I write by candle light
I find insight, fundamental movement, uh
So when it's back this insomniac take an original tack
Keep the beast in my nature under ceaseless attack
I gets no sleep
I can't get no sleep

I can't get no sleep
I can't get no sleep
I need to sleep, although I get no sleep
I need to sleep, although I get no sleep",Insomnia [Chris Crime Infinity Remix],2009

Alone on a hill
The man with the foolish grin
Is keeping perfectly still
But nobody wants to know him
They can see that he's just a fool
And he never gives an answer

But the fool on the hill
Sees the sun going down
And the eyes in his head
See the world spinning round

Well on the way
Head in a cloud
The man of a thousand voices
Talking perfectly loud

But nobody ever hears him
Or the sounds he appears to make
And he never seems to notice

But the fool on the hill
Sees the sun going down
And the eyes in his head
See the world spinning round

And nobody seems to like him
They can tell what he wants to do
And he never shows his feelings

But the fool on the hill
Sees the sun going down
And the eyes in his head
See the world spinning round

He never listens to them
He knows that they're the fools
They don't like him

Sees the sun going down
And the eyes in his head
See the world spinning round

A song that we all knew 
Though I did not know the language 
The song was ""Silent Night"" 
Then I heard my buddy whisper  
""All is calm and all is bright"" 
Then the fear and doubt surrounded me 
'Cause I'd die if I was wrong 
But I stood up on my trench 
And I began to sing along 
Then across the frozen battlefield 
Another's voice joined in 
Until one by one each man became 
A singer of the hymn 
Then I thought that I was dreaming 
For right there in my sight 
Stood the German soldier 
'Neath the falling flakes of white 
And he raised his hand and smiled at me 
As if he seemed to say 
Here's hoping we both live 
To see us find a better way 
Then the devil's clock struck midnight 
And the skies lit up again 
And the battlefield where heaven stood 
Was blown to hell again 
But for just one fleeting moment 
The answer seemed so clear 
Heaven's not beyond the clouds 
It's just beyond the fear 
No, heaven's not beyond the clouds 
It's for us to find it here",Belleau Wood,1997

Watched that chauffeur smokin' cigarettes 
By that long white limousine 
I could just imagine 
What was goin' on in there 
Sunlight streamin' through the stained glass 
And those flowers in her hair 
And in less time than it takes a tear to fall

As they opened up the doors

Tossin' that bouquet 
And when you got in that limo 
I drove off the other way 
And I still don't know 
Why things happened like they did 
But I parked that old pickup 
On that lonesome river bridge 
I took your ring from my pocket 
And I held it one last time 
Watched that diamond sparkle 
I drew back and I let her fly 
And in less time than it takes to tear to fall 
Oh that old ring went under
