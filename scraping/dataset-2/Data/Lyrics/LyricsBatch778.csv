Neville Brothers,"One fine day, you'll look at me
And you will know our love was, meant to be
One fine day, you're gonna want me for your girl
The arms I long for, will open wide
And you'll be proud to have me, right by your side
One fine day, you're gonna want me for your girl
Though I know you're the kind of boy
Who only wants to run around
I'll keep waiting, and, someday darling
You'll come to me when you want to settle down,
Oh!
One fine day, we'll meet once more
And then you'll want the love you threw away before
One fine day, you're gonna want me for your girl
One fine day, you're gonna want me for your girl",One Fine Day,2000
Neville Brothers,"Your performance is almost over
When you're through I will take you home
To a place where the water's always fresh and cool
I will lay you down, take off your shoes

Yes, it can, guess it's bound to take your place
Has that sad, almost crying look on your face
'Cause you knew you've done your best
Now, honey leave the rest to me and I'll take care of you

As I watch you fall down to your knees
They don't know that you're praying to please
They don't see the little angel that you've backed with a star
The only one who knows exactly who you are

? they don't understand
And they cheer as you carry on your endless plan
You are weary but you must, it's the only thing you trust
As you live, you got to give

Your performance is almost over
When you're through I will take you home
Where it goes to I can see that, help your needs
I'll take care of you

'Cause you've done your best
Now, honey leave the rest to me
And I'll take care of you",Performance,2000

I just wanna be back where I belong

Neville Brothers,"There's a new girl in my neighborhood 
She's a sweet little thing, she looks real good 
She gets everybody's attention around 
They call her sweet little mama 

All the boys wink when they see her 
Even the girls smile when they meet her 
Everybody's trying to be first 
To hold sweet little mama 

She got a certain secret in her smile 
That makes you want to stay awhile 
But the minute you get too close 
She bursts out with a loud, loud cry 

Stop by my house and you can't miss her 
This little girl is my little sister 
She's about nine days old 
They call her sweet little mama 

Say she got a certain secret in her smile 
That makes you want to stay awhile 
The minute you get too close 
She bursts out with a loud, loud cry 

Stop by my house, you can't miss her 
This little girl is my little sister 
Well, she's about 9 days old 
They call her sweet little mama",Sweet Little Mama,2000
Neville Brothers,"The hills were alive with wildflowers and I
Was as wild, even wilder than they
For at least I could run
They just died in the sun
And I refused to just wither in place
Just a wild mountain rose
Needing freedom to grow
So I ran fearing not where I'd go

When a flower grows wild
It can always survive
Wildflowers don't care where they grow

And the flowers I knew
In the fields where I grew
Were content to be lost in the crowd
They were common and close
I had no room for growth
And I wanted so much to branch out
So I uprooted myself from home ground and left
Took my dreams and I took to the road

When a flower grows wild
It can always survive
Wildflowers don't care where they grow

I grew up fast and wild
And I never felt right
In a garden so different from me
I just never belonged
I just longed to be gone
So the garden one day set me free
I hitched a ride with the wind
And since he was my friend
I just let him decide where we'd go

When a flower grows wild
It can always survive
Wildflowers don't care where they grow

Just a wild rambling rose seeking mysteries untold
No regret for the path that I chose
When a flower grows wild
It can always survive
Wildflowers don't care where they grow",Wildflower,2000
Neville Brothers,"Every time the telephone rings I hold my breath 
Hoping that it's you, I'm scared to death 
Phone went ring, my crippled heart cried 
Let it be you, on the line 
Then a voice say hello, can I speak to Joe? 
Wrong number, I'm sorry, good bye 

Pity the fool who loves you so 
If you found someone new, don't let me know 
The phone rang once again, 
My heart skipped a beat 
Must be you, this is my belief 
Then the voice on the other end 
Say can I speak to Ben? 
Wrong number, I'm sorry, good bye 

I live simply on the memory 
Of your love that was once for me 
Come back my darling please 
And set my heart at ease 
Then a voice say hello, 
Darling you know I love you so 
Hold on baby, 'til I tell these blues good bye 
'Til I tell these blues good bye",Wrong Number,2000
Neville Brothers,"People movin' out, people movin' in.
Why, because of the color of their skin.
Run, run, run, but you sho' can't hide
An eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth.
Vote for me and I'll set you free
Rap on, brother, rap on.

humiliation, obligation to our nation

Eve of destruction, tax deduction,
City inspectors, bill collectors,
Evolution, revolution, gun control, the sound of soul,
Shootin' rockets to the moon, kids growin' up too soon
Politicians say more taxes will solve ev'rything, and the band played on.
Round and round and around we go, where the world's headed nobody knows.
Great googa mooga, can't you hear me talkin' to you, just a 
Ball of Confusion that's what the world is today. (yeah, yeah)
 
Fear in the air, tension ev'rywhere

and the only safe place to live is on an Indian reservation, 
and the band played on
Eve of destruction, tax deduction, 
City inspectors, bill collectors, mod clothes in demand, 
population out of hand, suicide too many bills, hippies movin' to the hills

You gotta watch your back
Well I beg your pardon
Walk the straight and narrow track
If you walk with Jesus
He's gonna save your soul
You gotta keep the devil
Way down in the hole

He's got the fire and the fury
At his command

If you hold on to Jesus hand
We'll all be safe from Satan
When the thunder rolls
We just gotta help me keep the devil
Way down in the hole

All the angels sing about Jesus' mighty sword
And they'll shield you with their wings
And keep you close to the lord

Nevins,"Unemployment at a record high
People coming, people going, people born to die
Don't ask me, because I don't know why
But it's like that, and that's the way it is

People in the world try to make ends meet
You try to ride car, train, bus, or feet
I said you got to work hard to want to compete
It's like that, and that's the way it is
Huh!

Money is the key to end all your woes
Your ups and your downs, your highs and your lows
Won't you tell me last time that love bought you clothes?
It's like that, and that's the way it is

Bills fly higher every day
We receive much lower pay
I'd rather stay young, go out and play
It's like that, and that's the way it is
Huh!

War's going on across the sea
Street soldiers killing the elderly
What ever happened to unity?
It's like that, and that that's the way it is

Disillusion is the word
That's used by me when I'm not heard
I just go through life with my glasses blurred
It's like that, and that's the way it is
Huh!

You can see a lot in this lifespan
Like a bum eating out of a garbage can
You notice one time he was your man
It's like that (what?) and that's the way it is

You should've gone to school, you could've learned a trade
But you laid in bed where the bums have laid
Now all the time you're crying that you're underpaid
It's like that (what?) and that's the way it is
Huh!

One thing I knoe is that life is short
So listen up homeboy, give this a thought
The next time someone's teaching why don't you get taught?
It's like that (what?) and that's the way it is

If you really think about it times aren't that bad
The one that stretches for success will make you glad
Stop playing start praying, you won't be sad
It's like that (what?) and that's the way it is
Huh!

When you feel you fail sometimes it hurts
For a meaning in life is why you search
Take the boys on the train, drive to school on the church
It's like that, and that's the way it is

Here's another point in life you should not miss
Do not be a fool who's prejudice
Because we're all written down on the same list
It's like that (what?) and that's the way it is
Huh! (Repeat 4x)

A pugni stretti in tasca
E chiudo gli occhi perché
Così non sento

Respiro dentro al petto

E ciò che non mi hai detto
È quel che sento
Sento..

Che ti sei allontanata per difenderti
Sento..
Dentro I tuoi silenzi le parole di un addio
Sento..
Ricordi che... sento..
Ricordi che... sento..

Riflesso sull'asfalto
L'odore della pioggia
Rivedo una partita
Che sto perdendo

What are you feeling?

Come contro il vento
Tutta la mia confusione

La paura di sparire

And I'll treasure till I die
So for now, dear

But I'm how-d'ye, not farewell
For in time we may have a love's glory
Our love story to tell

Just as every autumn
Leaves fall from the tree
Tumble to the ground and die
So in the springtime
Like sweet memories
They will return as will I

Like the sun, dear

We'll return, dear

And we'll banish the pain and the sorrow
Until tomorrow goodbye

Well I came here for something funky to happen
Is this Christmas 'cause everybody's rappin
You better get sparked by the song that I sing
Although my name ain't Martin Luther
But I'm considered the king
yo, my beats pumped by the mic I clamp
I don't need an amplifier
my brain is the amp
I got the beats that make you tingle
make your body mingle
Like you got the fever for the flavor of a Pringle
Weak I say not so
I'm just like Picasso
A pioneer
I am here
Ask me how I got so fly
Any sense that I can give 'em
a New Beginning Stevie-o
and my dope rhythm
I sent the Lord master give a mental harm
My sole chief belief is that Islam
My beats pumped so let it grab ya
I got a trick but my name ain't Ali-Babba
So open Sessame
Neva heard the best of me
Betcha all the people intheplaceiswacknowlet'ssee

And if you didn't know I could tell you that I'm a
Mellow cool brotha
Slicker than oil
Rap get so hot it makes the spit boil

Not the avarage rapper the K is more
Ryhmes like the thunderbolt of the mighty Thor
Pick a cell 'cause I can conquer boy
I break MCs like a Tonka Toy
Smooth suave savage yet debonair
Come in the party yeah I see you stop and stare
To hear the man to only have yo hand shook
You dress too cute to me you have the Jordache look
'cause I'm the mystical
Rap is polyphysical
Ask about Kwame 
hey say he is a  musical fellow
he always mellow
He's neva highstung spunk
and when the mic is near him
it cleva I run smooth like Moet
recite just like a poet
Ain't my slam oh man I know it
'cause when I'm on the mic while boys say oh golly
chick on my tip like a hip on poly grip
I go cameo be on the grammy show
I be sleek as a sheik out freak ganny ho
in the panty hose pumping close
yo my rhymes slam well I suppose 'cause
I'm might neader um go washin that again
to write a fresh rhyme you know I can again
'cause I destroy plus I'm like a hemmorid
strong like a steroid avoid the Noid
The Rhythm

The black can take the M A X
And as I step in the party that's when they ask
for me to get on strong no fear like a Gladiator
turn on steam up MC like a radiator
Play 'em all out executioner style
Speak my peace just release refusing to smile
This is serious though I rap a little humor
But still MC I hear assume I could neva
bust a fat rap twice
and at that price 
on any mic you gave me I got nice
A push a pull up a sit up get up I'm fed up
shut ya lip up and let's go head up

Gucci on silk you got Vasco in denim
No my name ain't taco Emilio or Paco 
but Kwame boy and I got yo 
Chick on the side 'cause she sweatin' my tip
Gave a peck on the neck just to wetten my lip
I don't drop my pants for those Raggedy Anns
just to pass up a chance on a kids romance

New Beginning,"Verse One:

Well I stumbled on a picture kinda made me laugh
A photograph, what brought me right back to the past
When I was a youngster
Quite nerd type, that wanted to be amongst the
Older, bolder, colder crowd
With fat gold chains and strolled around
In tucked silk suits, hundred dollar Bally boots
Hat to a tilt and a felt substitute 
Fashions my have seemed to have worked
But it seems I was a fake, and fakes look like jerks
All I could do is scheme
Hoping that one day I'll be on the top of the team
No matter how hard I tried, I'd just collide
With being a fool and an old guy
It didn't work, and that annoyed
And I asked myself why can't I be oneovdabigboiz

Chorus

Verse Two:

Now I remember one day in the 7th grade
A new girl came to school and I must say
I slid, skid, crashed and got a crush 
On her and all other things seemed like a bluff
I wouldn't dare to speak, didn't say a word
Trying to be a big boy, I just became a nerd
Doubting myself, thinking I'm all sissy and all
Either I was too short, too shy, or too small
Which was a sign of ignorance
So I brought up confidence
The next day I'm panicking
Stiff as a mannequin
What do you know
She doesn't even show
But there's tomorrow, the next day she came
Arm and arm with some dude, with some gangster name 
Hopes and dreams in a flash were destroyed
All because of the fuss of oneovdabigboiz

Chorus

Bridge: Tasha Lambert (singing)

I'm the one that told you not to worry
You'll grow up to be someone special
Take your time and don't you hurry
'Cause soon you will be

Chorus

Verse Three:

They all have eyes, they all have two feet
They used to pick their girls up but on a train we meet
Why can't I be a big boy I used to ask myself
And self said ""Why do you want to be someone else
Why do you want to wear what someone else wears
Or get a cut, like someone else's hair
Or be seen in someone else's glare
You know what I'm saying (you're right)"" YEAH!
I'll do my own thing speak my own slang
Be in my own swing, know what I'm saying
'Cause baby I'm a star
You know who the hell I are
It's paying off a lot
I had everyone rocking the streets and wanting the polka dots
It's OK, this life is I enjoy
And it's cool being Kwame, not oneovdabigboiz

And a sorrow no one hears
Still rings in midnight silence in her ears
 
Let her cry for she's a lady
Let her dream  for she's a child
Let the rain fall down upon her
She's a free and gentle flower growing wild

And if by chance that I should hold her
Let me hold her for a while
And if allowed just one possession
I would pick her from her garden to be mine
Be careful how you touch her for she'll awaken
And sleep's the only freedom that she knows
And when you look into her eyes you won't believe
For the way she's always paying for a debt she never owed
And a silent wind still blows that she can only hear, so she goes
 
Let her cry for she's a lady
Let her dream  for she's a child
Let the rain fall down upon her
She's a free and gentle flower growing wild

Let her cry for she's a lady
Let her dream  for she's a child
Let the rain fall down upon her
She's a free and gentle flower growing wild

She's a free and gentle flower growing growing wild
She's my flower, growing growing growing wild
Growing growing growing growing wild
She's my free and gentle flower",Wild Flower,1995

Piercing me right through the core

Soon are all gonna work out
But there's that same unhappy feeling
There's that anguish, there's that doubt
It's the same old dizzy hangup

San Jacinto, the poison bite and darkness take my sight, I hold the line
And the tears roll down my swollen cheek, think I'm losing it, getting weaker
I hold the line, I hold the line
San Jacinto, yellow eagle flies down from the sun, from the sun

We will breathe, of the air
We will drink, from the stream
We will live, hold the line

With a touch, a smile - while the cradle's burning

Oh the more that it's surrounding us
The more that it destroys
Turn up the signal
Wipe out the noise

Of all those who can tell me wrong from right
When all things beautiful and bright

New Blood Orchestra,"Climbing up on Solsbury Hill
I could see the city light
Wind was blowing, time stood still
Eagle flew out of the night
He was something to observe
Came in close, I heard a voice
Standing, stretching every nerve
Had to listen, had no choice
I did not believe the information
Just had to trust imagination
My heart going boom, boom, boom
""Son"", he said, ""grab your things, I've come to take you home""

To keep in silence I resigned
My friends would think I was a nut
Turning water into wine
Open doors would soon be shut
So I went from day to day
Though my life was in a rut
'Til I thought of what I'll say
Which connection I should cut
I was feeling part of the scenery
I walked right out of the machinery
My heart going boom, boom, boom
""Hey"", he said, ""grab your things, I've come to take you home""
(Hey, back home)

When illusion spin her net
I'm never where I want to be
And liberty she pirouette
When I think that I am free
Watched by empty silhouettes
Who close their eyes but still can see
No one taught them etiquette
I will show another me
Today I don't need a replacement
I'll tell them what the smile on my face meant
My heart going boom, boom, boom

They take you to your limits, they take you beyond

And I am cold and
Hard and swollen

Kneel down beneath me
Tear me open and release me

Half-way swallowed

Cheeks are hollow

I feel lifted
She is gifted
My legs trembled
My hand's drifted
Behind her head
I think that I might be in love

She'll give in and 
She'll get on it 
Once she knows how bad I want it
And she'll turn herself around
My hands clamp tight around her shoulders
With one arm she'll push off the wall
And I'll bend that body over

I swear once I get up in her
She completely melts around me
She gets wetter than Seattle
Her lakes deep enough to drown me

Every man needs a Diane

I bit her bottom lip
She pulled my head down
Her stomach quivered
As I moved my tongue around

First the outside 
Around the edges
Below the belt now
Behind the hedges

Then the inside
I pull her open
One hand's positioned
The other hand's groping

A slender neckline
A heaving chest
Her thighs grip tighter
She tears at my flesh
I think that I might be in love

She'll give in and
She'll get on it
Once she knows how bad I want it
And when she starts to come around
I push her up against the wall
I can feel my insides tightening up
I can't feel my limbs at all

I ride her harder 'till she's caving in
My blood pumps through my veins
My heart beats against her back
And then I scream out ""What a shame!""

Oh for real, yup
Aiight
Yo let me tell you a story
Aiight bruh, for sure
(I got way too many chicks)
Check it out bruh
(I got way too many chicks)
Wake up

I met this girl named Chanel
From ATL
An actress and a singer
She was paid in mills
We first spoke
I thought I found a bad chick on the spot
'Till I noticed that her breath
Smell like fat kids in a box
I met this girl named Jill
Who wanted my baby
I always told her no
But I ain't know she was crazy
I was in I had to bust
I was like wait Jill
She put a gun to my head
And was like (stay still)
I met this girl named Laneice
A freak but ugly
Stripped for me once
And her butt cheeks was musty
Every time it got loud she would sneak a small fart
Chick passed so much gas
She could make a car start
New this chick named Shirley
She acted so perky
But lil did I know that the chick had herpes
Tried kissed me in my sleep I got up and screamed
Chick had a cold sore that looked like John McCain
Now I'm sitting on my couch (couch)
Thinking how it get to the point
Where I can't even get a decent sounding chick
One more try to holla I'm a mase him in the lip
I never thought it would be bad that I got way too many chicks

[Chorus]
I got way too many chicks
(I got way too many chicks)
I got way too many chicks
(I got way too many chicks)
I got way too many chicks
(Hey)
But if I had a dollar for the good ones
I wouldn't make shit
(Ha ha)

I got way too many chicks
(I got way too many chicks)
I got way too many chicks
(I got way too many chicks)
I got way too many chicks
But if I had a dollar for the good ones
I wouldn't make shit

I met this one chick
Named Miley Checks
I was so fascinated by Miley's breast
She said she had a gift
It was probably sex
She took her wig off
She looked like Kanye West
I met this girl named Teeka
She was not no groupie
She was a black belt
Starred in Kong Fu Movies
I liked her, but I had to dump her on the second date
Cause every time she moved her mouth
Her words will come out second blaze
I met this chick named Ivett
Who invented sex
I got her naked in an hour
The we hit the bed
She was twitching so much
Like she had the best
I found out the real reason
Cause she had torettes
There was one teacher
Named was Mrs.Chandelier
She was so bomb
That I would skip lunch just to see her
Til she snuck up from behind me
And I kicked her out of fear
Sounded like Ja Rule
Was tryna whisper in my ear
Now I'm sitting on my couch
Just thinking how I can't even get a decent sounding chick
One more try to holla I'm a mase him in the lip
I never thought it would be bad that I got way too many chicks

Oh I'm hella dope, get hella dough

You ever been to the space museum?
Well, my dick just like that telescope
U-huh, damn, u-huh, damn

'Cause them cats be on that fish shit, ugh
She said she'll hear the tune because it's perfect
She want many man, taking em shots like Curtis bitch

Bad bitches

And when I'm done you gon' tell him to leave you alone

Nigger, fuck your bitch
OK, I'll make her call me B-I
Bitch I'm on my B-I
All my bottles they be knee high

And I'm everything but sober
Break, break, breaking that tree and backing it up
Like its October
Wow! I walk in this bitch with a grip in my hand
I tell her I'm me, she jizz in her pants
She's shake it around and around and around,
Her coochies a flood, my stick is a dam
I found twenty thousand she just found my dick,
So I guess we both just hit a lick
I tell her welcome, welcome to the good life
Heard you had a bad day, well, let's make it good night
If they say we ain't big
We'll turn this to a Suge Knight,
Let's swim in alcohol and hop up on that Red Eye Kush flight
I'm Mr. Big, bitch

And when I'm done you gon' tell him to leave you alone

Bro why your girl all up on me like I'm John Doe
Hanging out back stage, waiting for a photo
Oh you dance and you a go-go
Was sure look nice to meet you
No your dude fuckin' up
He can't handle your model features
On a scale of one to nine, sorry shorty
But youz a dime
Your man lost and I'm not gonna hesitate to make you mine
I'm bout to snatch you up, like a food market
Time to bag her up
Because I only got one night, so we acting up
Oh girl you drunk, I bring them up
So much sluts and they so much fun
So my jack that I cant give it back
So I keep on going cause I can't get enough
Little momma where you goin' so much paper to be made

I know you mad cause you caught me with a jump off
Jump off fuckin' down in my room
But I say it ain't what it seem, what if we switched places
I'd feel same way too (And let you leave)
Baby girl I promise (And let you leave)
That it ain't what it look like (I'd let you leave)
I'm just tryin' to be honest (Gon' let you leave)
Baby it was just one night

I had a girlfriend, I finally settled down
She gave her all to me, seven pounds
She had a boyfriend, who career was rappin'
He gave his all to her, unless a girl distracts him
I ain't even wanna go sexin' her but
I mean the girl kept on blowin' my text up
Like ""Legacy, come over, your girlfriend cock blockin""
And she had food can't turn down a hot pocket
I guess my actions led to your packin'
I know you walked in but I swear it didn't happen
how your brain processed it to be
I tried to run from her but she wasn't lettin' me be
See, what happened was she put pills in my cup
Threw my clothes in the tub and went down as I slept
Wait, where you goin? Baby calm down
Okay, I lied to you, but before you walk out

[Chorus]

Look, I know I'm wrong for the things I done
I passed up a couple of chances because I'm sprung
We've been together for four months, she pushed my buttons
Can't forgive it little daddy girl I messed up once, haha
I don't like her, she was a one nighter
If endin' love was a girl, we can both fight her
Of course bro I like her, I was 'bout to wife her
If she don't let me go then yeah, I'm gon' wife her
LOL, I'ma send her ass a text
Talkin' 'bout ""I miss you baby what's up next?""
And if you don't get back I'ma call her up next
Let her know I love her have to say what's on my chest
I didn't do it yet, but I'ma still count seconds
And if I get my girl back then I got all my blessings
Grabbed the iPhone and the service started ringin'
And she picked up the phone ""Look baby I was thinkin'""

You got your nails done, I bet your ex wouldn't notice.
Swag on point, she don't shop at all the local spots.
Without makeup, she look like she been photo-shopped.
You had a deal, you'll get Marbury meals.
If you on the front cover, you'll be off every shelf.

She got rid of the Bush like Obama came in
And you broke, need the bank to spendin'
Two quarters in your pants like Chelsea Handler
You not mean just ?
But they mistake you for a bitch like Kelsey Grammer
But it's cool, cause I know it's not legit
You just hella insecure and like to talk a shit
But don't mistake for bein' a nine when you greased up

New Boyz,"Like damn, I don't really like to argue,
Think it's pointless, but you like to start to,
Like I heard this, she said that,
And then my friends told me they must be facts,
Here we go with this stuff again,
You just met these girls, and you trustin' them?
And she put it on me, screamin' so loud,
That I'm left with no choice but to tune her out,
(Stupid mother) I love you too, you workin' out girl? I love them shoes!
Yeah I love you want to, if that's what you do,
Cause I like when your mad, I think its so cute,
I shut her up by the compliments,
That's really the only way I can stop the fits,
So every time she start yellin' in here,
I close my eyes and put my hands on my ear like

Na na na, say what? Na na na I cant hear you!
Na na na what's that? I cant hear you!
I swear it's like you talkin' to a wall,
Cause I ain't listen to you at all,
But you keep tryna talk talk talk, but wah wah wah,
But talk all the shit you want cause I be zonin' you out.
Same old brand new station,
I aint listenin', I be zonin' you out,
You talking like it's the end of the world,
When you aint got shit to say, I be zonin',
Out my ear, out my ear, out my ear, I be zonin' you out
Out my ear, out my ear, out my ear, I be zonin' you out

Damn get out my ear though,
Got these old folks lookin' at us like weirdo's,
Can we just sit and talk about it?
Instead of you tryna tell ya pops about it,
You don't needa go that far, it's just me and you,
Your daddy too old what that nigga gon do?
Oops my bad, you know I aint mean it,
What I'm tryna say is we needa quit beefin',
She smiled at me and said
""Your right, but who was that girl you was with last night?""
She started going off like burnt lights,
At this rate we gon' never work right,
That's when I planned somethin' different,
The only way to deal with her is to not listen,
So I put my hands on my ear till she stopped trippin' like

Na na na, say what? Na na na I cant hear you!
Na na na what's that? I cant hear you!
I swear it's like you talkin' to a wall,
Cause I ain't listen to you at all,
But you keep tryna talk talk talk, but wah wah wah,

When you aint got shit to say, I be zonin',
Out my ear, out my ear, out my ear, I be zonin' you out
Out my ear, out my ear, out my ear, I be zonin' you out

Seem like all you want is for me to hear ya voice,
Even if all the things you say is true, there's still no point,
For you to be trippin' like you are, it ain't that bad,
I even left my ex girl for you,
And she ain't that mad, here we go again,
Here we go again with same damn argument
I don't know the chick I don't know the chick,
Will you please get off my ear,
Think about all the times
You find out a lie just to bring you down,
You're way too loud, if you gon' try and shout,
Then I'll be zonin' you out like

Na na na, say what? Na na na I cant hear you!
Na na na what's that? I cant hear you!
I swear it's like you talkin' to a wall,
Cause I ain't listen to you at all,

Uh, drive off to take my girl to have a nice day
She was nice so I let her hang my way
You look cute girl, what you wanna do girl?
Drive to my house cause it's only me and you girl
Checking her out, she had to put her swag on
Acting too happy saying she ain't going back home
I'm like wow, whatever you say, 
But whatever you plan gotta be done at eight

Next stop,
Party at my place, of course you're welcome girl, you ain't taking up space
We get there, and shawty still looking right,
She attacked me, but wait let me dim the lights
You look different, she's like boy stop it
No, I ain't playing actually you more poppin'
That's shocking, know what's really raw
All over baby even the lights off

You're a dime, so beautiful

Because I ain't gon' put up wit you 
Talkin' bout how she make you uncomfortable 
I mean, shit I'm only 17

No I'm not gon' make a scene

But let's get it through your head 
Yea we make love, sex weed all in the bed 
It's the best and I love her but things don't change

Now you stuck like a stain and I cant believe that 
Baby girl one hundred,I ain't tryna do that 
Got too many girls and I ain't letting go 
'Cause my life is great and you ain't nothin' but a hoe 
Yea you come to my shows and you very supportive 
Just showed me a camera and my show recorded 
It was nice, I'm surprised that you still standin' here

You are sorry, but do we even know why?

There’s a river rushing deep through the canyons of my being
It flows endlessly as I rise above the heat of this confusion
Exasperated, torn and disillusioned
Every tear we cry brings us closer

The wars that we wage in the name of honesty
The fires that rage out of necessity
They all bring us closer…

I celebrate forever and I’m surrounded by your love
Every time a leaf falls and it rises to the sky
I celebrate your spirit 
And I know I need not say goodbye…

Only your soul tells you to find your peace at home

Then fill your head with silly little pretty little pleasures
Never look back at where you’ve been before

They wanna to make me over, just a little more uptown.
Say I need to change my image, now tell me what's that mean.
Don't they know I've got country in my genes?

Well, I can't help the way I talk, I wouldn't change it if I could.
Sophisticated ain't my style, but country fits me good.
I ain't ashamed to wear what's been handed down to me.
Lord, I've got country in my genes.

I've got country in my genes, country in my blood.
It goes back generations. It's something I'm proud of.
It's something I was born with, what you get is what you see.
I'm just an old hillybilly with a country song to sing.
Lord, I've got country in my genes.

If country's hit the big time, me, I'm still the same.
I ain't above my raisin' and I ain't about to change.
I wouldn't trade my Wranglers for the finest gaberdine.

For someone else's selfish gain
Here there is no choosing, working the clay
Wearing their anger like a ball and chain

But soon the sun was faded and freedom was a song
I heard them singing when the day was done
Singing to the holy one

Comforts the seeking, lead me on

Labeled with a golden star
Heavy hearted boarding, whispers in the dark
Where are they going, is it very far?

Bitter cold terrain, echoes of a slamming door
In chambers made for sleeping forever
Voices like thunder in a mighty roar
Cry to the lord

Singing lead me on to a place where the river runs

Lead me on, the awaited deliverance
Comforts the seeking, lead me on

And we drown in the wake of our power

Weary, worn, and sad 
I found in Him a resting place 
And He has made, made me glad

I asked the Lord, 
how could He love me, 
I have sinned against Your will 
But He said, repent and I will forgive you, 
The question's who will you serve?

Does it bring happiness, does it make you cry?

Well listen.
When I was very young I used to sit around the house watching oil can harry battle mighty mouse
Until my mother said, son, that's not the way to be. you've got to go to school and learn your abcs.
I said, is that it, mom? 
She said, that's not even half. you've got to go to school, you got to learn some math.
You got to learn you to count- 1, 2, 3- and then get freshed up on the history.
My first day of school I'll never forget. my teacher said, recite the alphabet.
I said, a e m e l r, and, as you can see, I didn't get very far.
The teacher said, son, there's nothing to it. before the day's over, you'll learn how to do it.
And not only that, you'll learn how to read, and that's one thing in life you'll always need.
Well, school's not all work. there's fun things to do like gym, lunch, and recess, too.
Kindergarten was easy. it was mostly play. what I was worried about was elementary.

S c h o o l, you got to go to school and beat that bell.

Ha! now something got wrong. I took another turn.
I didn't want to study, didn't even want to learn.
Didn't want to go to class. I was always late because school became something that I started to hate.
Started hanging with my boys; didn't mean no harm. we was going around the school pulling fire alarms.
I was a chilly homeboy, yes, I was down because I came to school just to mess around.
I started hanging in the halls, writing on the walls, until I got started playing basketball.
But I didn't have a job so I couldn't get paid and I couldn't play ball because of my grades.
But I still used to practice each and every day in case the coach decided to let me play.
But it didn't work out the way I planned, so I ran to a man who said he can understand the troubles I was going through.
He said, son it's all about going to school.
So I e-mail, what goes here? ________ and now I'm moving up to the big leagues: high school.

E-mail, what goes here? ____________
I'm feeling cool 'cause I was going on to something they call high school.
And I feel important, 'cause things aren't the same, wondering why nobody knows my name.
That became something that I started to miss, and now that I'm here it feels like a big dis.
But, anyway, I had to leave. I had something to achieve.
It was singing- yeah- that's what I wanted to do, so I got a tutor, because I'm no fool.
Dropping out of school is quite absurd, and it's something new edition just spread the word.

Tossin' bottoms up
Now I got you fallin' in love

Alcohol
Half naked women is the life that I'm livin', my
Head's spinnin', the clock strikes five
(Yo how many girls can you fit in that ride?)
I don't know, the outfits will help me decide
(Why)
Less is more, and the more the merrier
Hurry up, the next stop, the Marriot
Tear her belly out while smearin' her mascara up
Poof, then its back on the bus
She never knew we checked out 'til they're wakin' her up
Don't blame me, better blame the one raisin' her up
""Look, that's not my daughter on that cam-corder"" (nu-uh)
I'm not daddy, even though she call me that, you know me
I don't call'em back, I'll catch you at the next party we be at

I haven't heard your voice on my phone (ooh ooh ooh oh)

Oh I'm so lost for words I can't explain how I'm feelin'

Lately I've been missing you everyone's been seeing you

That I am so in love with you
When I think of us two, I start feeling blue
Something that I've gotten used to
But lately I must admit times have been hard
Put a straining pain on my heart
As much as it hurts to say these words
I think that is best for you to

Leave me live your life don't worry
I will be alright
In no time you'll find someone
Who's better than I
Go now don't you cry
I'll always be right by your side
Maybe someday we'll get another try

It seems as though every time
I speak your name I get weak
'Cause I imagine before I go to sleep
That you are right here with me
Somebody told be
You can't appreciate what you got until it is gone
But they were so wrong because I have cherished you
Its just that I'm not the one you care

Leave me live your life don't worry
I will be alright
In no time you'll find someone
Who's better than I
Go now don't you cry
I'll always be right by your side
Maybe someday we'll get another try

Deep down inside
Please hear me now
You expect so much
That's why I'm hurtin' inside
And I don't even
And appreciate it for my average girl
This is where we've grown apart
And I don't know if we can handle
The trouble
If not its gonna hurt me to see you

Leave me live your life don't worry
I will be alright
In no time you'll find someone
Who's better than I
Go now don't you cry

Next in line was a fly girl standing tall
Signed my name and said give me a call baby ya know

the girl screamed and fainted panic on the floor
The body guard pulled us the back door
I never saw her anymore- it was an in-store heartbreak

Live at five interview for Channel 2
Saw a cutie thought she was on the T.V. cre
She said after the show (I'll be waiting for you) cool
After the show she got into the car and what a scence
I didn't know she was only thirteen
It was a young girl heartbreak

People think we don't get lonely
But we're far away from home
One minute 20,000 people
But then they go home, we're alone

It's off to another city
Where everybody knows my name
But when I meet that perfect honey
Is it me she wants or is it my fame

Girlies and groupies and parties all night
Is the life that can lead you to a N.E. heartbreak
From city to city our friends and our fans
they're the ones who can keep us from having
N.E. heartbreak

Center stage N.E. was groovin'
The beatwas hard
And the girlies were movin'
There she was third row center coolin'
She was cold

Last note of the last song
House lights up they came on
When I looked she was gone
It was a 3rd row heartbreak

People think our life is easy
'cause they think we've got it made
But we're living underpressure
Just to be on top
And to give the best that we can give you
And to never let you down
We'll keep strivin' for perfection
N.E. heartbreak is coming to your town

Beware of N.E. heartbreak
Spreading fast and there's no cure
No need to run from heartache
It's gonna get you, get you for sure

Called up my girl and said
Meet me on the tour
I got a suite cold chillin' on the 50th floior
And I'll leave your ticket at the door
And baby don't forget the pumps

She lost her backstage pass and the room key
Then got stopped by hotel security
And I spent the whole night lonely

And I won't stop 'til I fix your misleading

She was wrapped in a blanket by the pool,
There were rapid statements,
About life commitments,

I couldn't bare it.

It's not your fault so please stop your crying now,
Please stop your crying now,
Woah,
Woah.

There was staring and seclusion,
A fine tuned way of motion,
A face wrapped for a suitor,
The sound of hearts pumping at the same beat,
Coming 'round the corner,
In almost all directions,
A sense of heat that I couldn't bare to touch,
No, I couldn't bare it.

Beneath the shade of an old walnut tree 
Oh, I can still see the flowers blooming round her 
Where we met on the Isle of Capri 

She was as sweet as a rose at the dawning 
But somehow fate hadn't meant her for me 
And though I sailed with the tide in the morning 
Still my heart's on the Isle of Capri 

Summertime was nearly over 
Blue Italian sky above 
I said ""Lady, I'm a rover, 
Can you spare a sweet word of love?"" 

She whispered softly ""It's best not to linger"" 
And then as I kissed her hand I could see 
She wore a lovely meatball on her finger

Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb
Always reminding me that we're apart
You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms
The nightingale 
Tells his fairytale
Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain
My stardust melody

For I found you, the love of my life, in somebody else's arms

I felt a bump and heard an ""Oh, beg your pardon""

I held my breath and said ""May I have the next one?""
In my frightened arms, polka dots and moonbeams
Sparkled on a pug-nosed dream

As we floated over the floor
There were questions but my heart knew all the answers

To hear the Angels sing

And I hear them singing

Why can't I let myself enjoy 
The space I'm in
And all the wonderful
Places I've been
My eyes are on the future
I can't think about the past
My aspirations
Always exceed my grasp

You've got to reach a little bit higher
When the light within becomes a fire
Hey hey woa - oh you got to grow
You've got to reach a little bit higher
To get a hold on all that you desire
Stretch your soul and you'll never grow old

When the habits of a lifetime
Become a painful cage
You want to break out
But you don't know how to change
You may have a vision
Or you may have a friend
Who will come to you
And say these same words again

Where's the one I need the most?

I'll admit that I've been wrong

Oh no, but this here is somethin' else

New Grass Revival,"Once upon a Christmas morning
There was a pretty little baby boy
It seems like I remember sadness
Mingling in the joy
For Mary saw the future
And the sadness it would bring
And that's when Mary started crying
When she heard the angels sing

(Chorus:)
Let's make a baby king
Let's make him lord of all
Let's give him everything
Let's make a baby king

Now, you remember little king David
He's the little baby's kin
He's cousin to the man named John
And I know you all remember him

And John said, ""let's get ready!""
The herald angels sing
‘cause this old world needs to know
The good news that I bring

(Chorus:)
Let's make a baby king
Let's make him lord of all
Let's give him everything
Let's make a baby king

Now we could use a revolution
The world is turned upside down
We need a new direction
We've got to turn this whole thing around
And we need a lord to guide us
Teach us wrong and right
And we need a lamb to lead us
Into the land of light

You hope for the harvest and the long cold winter

Nah, he's at the park playing ball

Hey guys!
Where have you been?
Man, I've got a story to tell!
Hit it!

Saw a homegirl at the corner store
Eyes started bugging, mouth fell to the floor
She had a miniskirt and a sexy pose
I tried to rap to her, but I just froze
Tell me now fellas, what can I do?
To make a girl like me, like a girl likes you?

Well homeboy get ready!

'cause a girl needs love
And plenty of affection

I'd buy her diamonds and pearls just to make her my girl

She's not the type of girl to fall for any line

I'd take her out to dinner, treat her like a winner

'til I saw that girl and I started to drool
So I thought to myself, take it easily
I couldn't let peer pressure get the best of me
I thought to myself, what should I do?
That's when she came up on me and said 'I love you'

Who me?
Yeah, you!
Couldn't be!

We seen a bunch of hoods right before our eyes
They looked us up and down 
Once, twice, and again
There musta been a hundred to a hundred and ten
So I looked over my shoulder right at my friend
He said ""Nice knowing ya but this is the end""

New Kids on the Block,"I've heard of true loves that lasted forever
I guess there is a way
And I've heard of true loves that needed each other
More and more each day
What is love when there is no one that cares
Next time you need my love I'll be there
Be right by your side

Let's try it again, try it again
Let's try it again
My love for you it has no end
Let's try it again till the end
All because I love you

I've heard of true loves that stayed with each other
Didn't wander through the night
And I've heard of true loves that prayed for each other
Didn't argue, fuss, or fight
Now I know just what love's all about
Next time you need my love I won't doubt, doubt your love again

I didn't believe it
Had to see it with my eyes

You told me I could trust ya
If I didn't I would crush ya
But never thought that one day I'd bust you
Walking in the sand, hand in hand with
Another man, I know your game plan
And now I understand
Love so deep is like sleep
And it will leave you blind
But I see how your living
So baby next time
Watcha gonna do now that the tables are turned around
I'm livin' swell and now you wanna be down
Step off 'cause baby I've learned

You still look dope but a dope I'm not
I can't get with you 'cause you're too hot

Here's the kennel ration and the Alpo too

In the world that I know
Lovers come and go
Nobody anywhere, talk like you do
Saying dreams can come true

I'll do it faithfully

Feel it once, and you will see your world so differently

With her itty-bitty waist and her pretty pretty face
And the leanest, meanest, badest, badest body
Didn't have no time to waste, she was looking for a taste
And she was wanting me to party

Do you remember,
Or should I rewind,
To that summer when you caught my eye,
I played it cool,
The weather was hot,
You had the beauty and the beach on lock.

With your flip flops, half shirt, short shorts, mini skirt,
Walkin' on the beach, so pretty,
You wasn't lookin' for a man,
When you saw me in the sand,
But you fell for the boy from the city.

I was like, ""hey, girl, can I get your number?""
I remember what you told me too,
""Don't call after ten""
But you know that I did,
'Cause I couldn't stop thinkin' 'bout you.

Do you remember,
I'll never forget,
Touchin' your body all soakin' wet,
The water was cool,
The feelin' was hot,
Kissin' on you while the ocean rocked.

In your strapless sundress,
Kickin' back, no stress,
As long as we was together,
'Cause we were feelin' young love,
And we couldn't get enough.
Baby, I could reminisce forever.

And now I'm like,
Hey, girl, don't you know I miss it,
And I wonder if you miss it too,
Never thought it would end 'till it did,
Now, I'm here and I can't stop thinkin' 'bout you.

When the rain starts to fall
Couldn't fight through the storm
So I built up a wall
I was looking for something and
In all the wrong places
I was searching for love
In all the wrong faces

I saw a flicker of light in the darkness
Saw a reflection of me where your heart is

Baby, 'cause you
You're holding me up
You're holding me up
And I am thankful
You
You're more than enough
You're more than enough
And I am thankful
Everything I ever wanted
Never knew until I got it
Because of you
I am thankful (I am thankful)

Sometimes the pressure of the city's
Got me slipping back
But just the thought of you in it
Helps me stay on track
And when they're all going out
Just know I'll be coming home, baby
And when there's no one around
I know I'm not alone, baby

I saw a flicker of light in the darkness
Saw a reflection of me where your heart is

It did not stop there, we are form

To the song of knowledge ever sung

I thank You.

Verse 2:
From Your image we were made,

High up in the sky the little stars climb
Always reminding me that we're apart
You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms

Of paradise, where roses grew

And as the spotlight turns toward us, we all try our best to show
We are lost we are freaks, we are crippled, we are weak
We are the heirs, we are the true heirs, to all the world 

Let's go build a fire down on the empty beach when the waves are crashing high
White heat purify, as the sparks fly up into the great black sky
Sacrifice these crutches to the crackling flames
Stand as silhouettes against the dawn

We set out with our heads held high 
So sure our ground, our righteousness 
The new Jerusalem to be built with love and guts and truth
But in the end we surrendered easily 
It's no use pretending otherwise
Well most of us had a little something to lose, enough to break our nerve 

Well, some of us made an easy peace and moved into the Brave New World 
It's hard for the true believers to look back now and realize
That for many of the crowd it was just the fashion, the cause of the moment

Standing in last year's clothes
And some of us, shell-shocked still, ran for shelter and do the rituals 
The same old way pretending that someone out there cares
And some of us live in the modern world
We give unto Caesar what is due 
And harbor the bitterness of defeat and daydreams of revenge

The lost and lonely in vain
Out here we are running for the Wide open spaces
The road smell after the rain

We are old, we are young
We are in this together
Vagabonds and children (are)
Prisoners forever
With pulses a-raging
And eyes full of wonder
Kicking out behind us again

And watching as a boy alone
At the key side
The ships loading cargo in the night
Their names all calling to faraway places
The years go past, the miles go by
And still this childhood romance
Will not die

Strange tongues on the airwaves as the voices call from distant lands
I saw which was the winning side but still I joined the other

As the storm begins to break cover

Through the ice, the melting snows
Across the freezing skies and the tiny lights below

A toast to the Luddite martyrs then, who died in vain
Down at the lab they're working still, finishing off
How do we tell the people in the white coats
Enough is enough? 
Hey, hey I listen to you pray as if some help will come
Hey, hey She will dance on our graves when we are dead and gone

You and I we made no suicide pact - we didn't want to die
But we watch the wall, little darling, while the chemical trucks go by
This desperate imitation, now, of innocence
Those last few days at Jonestown ain't got nothing on this 
Hey, hey I listen to you pray as if some help will come
Hey, hey She will dance on our graves when we are dead and gone

Now beneath the fitted carpets, beyond the padded cells
Within these crimes of passion, the naked truth She dwells
And this fury's just a part and this thunder's just a part
Desire is just a part - the cracking ice, the splitting rock

Crackle with the static of a thousand little radios
Everyone talking, no-one listening
Well by now I should expect that
Down into the city I smell artificial green
A glasshouse full of growing things
That are not what they seem to be
Look away, look away, the procession's leaving town
The emperor rides naked and no-one gives a damn
That was the last time 

I get a morbid satisfaction watching Sunset in all its degradation
We were in a restaurant for wannabes clinking glasses in celebration
We had to leave before something bad occurred and Niko grabbed the keys
We drove out in the early morning with the radio jammed on are'n'be	
Drive away, drive away, and he turned to me and smiled
Said, how does it feel to be living through the Fall of Rome
And I said it's beginning to feel OK
The last time 

Well I gave you all my money
I'm ashamed to remember now just why I did that
I got bitter, I got jealous, but not as much as you
Do you understand that?
Ten hours drifting half awake and finally touching down
I went out in the rainy morning and kissed the blessed ground
Coming home, coming home and the most of it is done
And the worst of us is left behind in the place where it belongs

New Model Army,"The roll of distant thunder breaks
The afternoon of silence wakes
They hurry through from Petergate as if they know this dance
In fury blind I drive at night
Across the moors, the open roads
Beneath the freezing starry skies, racing in some trance

These cities are illusions of some triumph over Nature's laws
We've seen the iron carcass rust and buildings topple into dust
And as the waters rise it seems we cling to all the rootless things
The Christian lies, technology, while spirits scream and sing...
Oh, God, I love the world

Well I never said I was a clever man
But I know enough to understand
That the endless leaps and forward plans will someday have to cease
You blind yourselves with comfort lies
Like lightning never strikes you twice
And we laugh at your amazed surprise as the Ark begins to sink

The temple that is built so well, to separate us from ourselves
Is a power grown beyond control and a will without a face
And watching from outside I wish that I could wash my hands of this
But we are locked together here, this bittersweet embrace...
Oh, God, I love the world

And if one day the final fire
Explodes across the whitened sky
I know you said you'd rather die and make it over fast
With courage from your bravest friends
Waiting outside for the end
With no bitterness but an innocence that I can't seem to grasp

I know, somehow I will survive this fury just to stay alive
So drunk with sickness, weak with pain
I can walk the hills one last time
Scarred and smiling, dying slow
I'll scream to no one left at all
I told you so, I told you so, I told you so
Oh, God, I love the world",The World,2004

When the snake-black roads are just about clear

Blood of a river a mile wide
I am wired, I am wired, I am so wired

Blood of an ocean, rising tide
Into the wild, into the wild, into the wild

I feel her eyes upon my face
I feel her pulling me down in a tangle
Of sweat and hair and grace

Sharing and hoping, untouched for so long

You just can't believe me

Deeply moved, beyond all consolation
You felt the pulse, now hear the cry

I'm watching every move you make
Counting time spent in observation
A single blow a false mistake

  too, too much behind us)
