Lil Wayne,"Hey (I want a Soldier!)
The way you got it, I'm the hottest around
They'll know it when they see you rollin' impala's around
(I got a Soldier!)
Wit the top down feeling the sounds
Quakin' and vibratin' your thighs ridin' harder than guys
Wit the chrome wheels at the bottom, white leather inside
When them flames be spittin' at you tell 'em don't even try it
To shot it wit Chelle and kick it wit Kelly or holla at B
Ya, gotta be g's you way outta your league
Please!

We like dem boys that be in them lac's leanin' (Leanin')
Open their mouth their grill gleamin' (Gleamin')
Candy paint, keep that whip clean and (Clean and)
(They always be talkin that country slang, we like)
They keep that beat that be in the back beatin' (Beatin')
Eyes be so low from that chief (chief and)
I love how he keep my body screamin' (Screamin')
A rude boy that's good to me, wit street credibility

If your status ain't hood
I ain't checkin' for him
Betta be street if he lookin' at me
I need a soldier
That ain't scared to stand up for me
Known to carry big things 
If you know what I mean
If your status ain't hood
I ain't checkin' for him
Betta be street if he looking at me
I need a soldier
That ain't scared to stand up for me
Gotta know to get dough
And he betta be street

We like dem boys up top from the BK (BK)
Know how to flip that money three ways (Three ways)
Always ridin' big on the freeway (Freeway)
(Wit that east coast slang that us country girls be like)
Low cut caesars wit the deep waves (deep waves)
So quick to snatch up your Beyonce (Beyonce)
Always comin down poppin our way (Our way)

Next to the speakers keep a toy in the trunk of the 'lac
A reformed D boy use to run into traps
Still a soldier do to war if you running your trap
About my girls ain't no thing to put you under the map
Walk the streets five deep with nothing less than a stack
And 80 carats on my chest provides a special attraction
50 G's in my jeans plus the dough from the waller
It's the reason I'm the king girl, I know what you like

Hey, see cash money is a army
I'm walkin' wit purple hearts on me
You talkin' to the sargeant
Body marked up like the subway in harlem
Call him, weezy f baby, please say the baby
If you don't see me on the block I ain't tryna hide
I blend in wit the hood, i'm camouflage
Bandana tied, so mommy join my troop
Now every time she hear my name she salute

Lil Wayne,"I'm the Fireman
Fire, Fa, Fireman
I got that fire I'm hollering
I got that fire come and try me and
You can spark it up and I'm a put you out
You can spark it up and I'm a put you out

Ain't nobody fuckin' with me man, Heatman
Ski Mask spending next weeks cash, he fast
And I don't even need a G pass I'm pass that
I'm passin' 'em out now and you can't have that
And my chain Toucan Sam that
Tropical colors you can't match that
Gotta be abstract
You catch my gal legs open better smash that
Don't be surprise if she ask where the cash at
I see she wearing them jeans that show her butt crack
My girls can't wear that why that's where my stash at
I put my mack down that's where you lack at
She need her candlelit and I'm a wax that
I rekindle the flame
She remember the name
It's Weezy Baby January December the same
Mama gimme that brain
Mama gimme that gut
Cause I'm the fireman
You hear the firetruck

I'm the fireman
Fire, fa, fireman
I got that fire I'm hollering
I got that fire come and try me and
You can spark it up and I'm a put you out
You can spark it up and I'm a put you out

Fresh on campus it's the Birdman junior
Money too long teachers put away ya rulers
Raw tune not a cartoon
No shirt, tattoos, and some war wounds (sexy)
I'm hot but the car cool
She wet that's a carpool
Been in that water since a youngin' you just shark food
Quick Draw McGraw I went to art school
Yeah the lights is bright but I got a short fuse
Don't snooze

Good grief man this world is quite heavy on my aching back
Cops killing for crack you know the story snakes eat rats

Stacking figures I'm standing firm life's a slinky
Pipes is filled with crack cocaine

Though I bear a name only one call live with

I'm sicker with it
Pick a city buy a condo find a fine hoe let some time go chill

Lil Wayne,"So ""Little Wayne,"" whats your motivation? 

Is that really a question?
Do you really have that written down in your notepad? 
You should be ashamed of yourself
You smell me girl 
I smell like money 
See, that's what they don't understand 
(Tell 'em a god damn thing) 
To me it was always get money or die 
I come up under Birdman the number one stunner 
You know what I mean I'm stunner junior 
That's all I know that's all I ever knew 
Get money or get nothing you know what I'm saying 
And I feel that way 
For real 

So hard I go I keep pushing 
The game so crazy I'm in it like deep p**** 
I got chips from trying to get the whole cookie 
Used to make a thousand dollars every time I played hookie 
Dwayne Carter absent keep looking 
I'm present on the block 
I'm a legend on the block 
Ice so bright like heaven on the watch 
Yea n**** I done dropped one eleven on the watch

Weezy F. Baby now the F is for Fema
Sick n**** b**** I spit that Leukemia 
Yea no cure no help 
So me so good so hard so felt 
Feel me 

And that's just my point right there 
That's what I'm always trying to stress know what I'm saying 
If you don't understand me if you don't feel me then you ain't real 
In my eyes, and that's all that count to me, you know?

So, is your music considered the voice of urban America 
Or America period? 

I mean, I would say the voice of the hood, cause that's who I speak for 
And myself, you know what I mean, my family that's who I represent 
My homies, my girl, my life you know 

C'mon, bang this s*** n**** pump my s*** 
You gotta bang that wimp and go and dump that b**** 
You gotta claim that strip and go and flood that b**** 
You gotta aim that s*** and straight bust that s***

Tevin Campbell, no homo, black Rambo 
F***ing with the boy baby that's a gamble
If he won in Vegas leave him on the crap table 
I'm willing and I'm able to come run up in your stable 
Like nobody make a sound where the paper where the paper 
Gotta get it gotta have it 
Once I got it I'm a spend it 
Then its back to doing any damn thing just to get it 
The re-ups be like birthday parties 
No room to park the cars in the garages 
So outside the cribs all you see is arragis 
If I ain't say it right f*** it I ain't foreign 
Feel me 

And see 
That's where everybody get me wrong at 
You know what I mean 
I got that heat rock, for real 
 
Why do you think other rappers 
Lack the impact of your music?

That's because they ain't got that heat rock like me 
You know what I mean 
They ain't spitting like me 
They spitting, but, know what I mean, they ain't got colds 
I got the flu over here man, for real 
I need relief, y'all help me 
I know y'all sick of me, 
'cause I'm tired of y'all for real 

And based on the bank, 
I'm doing much better than a lot of these n****s 
I'm tired of these n****s 
Yawning when I see them make me stretch and pull the burner 
I'm c***ing back and pa**ing 
They catch 'em in they sternum 
Ooh ooh that gone probably burn ya 
That gone probably learn ya 
To never ever ever, ever ever ever come around here no more 
Rich gangsters over here you gotta die with the broke b**** 
I'm the God I should ride with the Pope

Hearing through the grapevine, n****s wanna hate mine

No preventing the grind, I gotta get it 
I'm admitted to the game, true playa, no quitting
There you go s***ting on a way a n**** thanking
Only history I know is Benjamin Franklin 
This is the future ain't promised to no one 
I live everyday like this is the sure one 
Train in the tidal wave, this is the ocean 
Stand in the heat, 'til the mother f***ing snow come 
And it feels so f***ing good 
Throw my dope like a rope, let them tug and pull 
No hope for the hopeless, rats and roaches 
Running cross the porch, in the attic there's a fortune 
Come and get it, automatics in motion

Need a shoulder to lean on, somebody to cry to 
It's like everything's gone, but I'm a survivor 
Standing on stage in front of thousands 
Don't amount to me not having my father 
That's real talk, I know a lot of y'all got 'em 
But you need 'em way more when you gotta go without 'em 
And I'm without 'em, but that's life y'all 
Sometimes you gotta learn to swim with no lifeguard 
I'm alright God, s*** I'm still breathing
But lose hurt like bullets, I'm about to start bleeding

Area code five zero four, I ain't Nino f***ing Brown
And, this is Tha Carter hoe, this is a quarter stick
This in ya garter ho, leave out the back and go straight to the corner store
Return with the cake, come wit all ma dough

More pressure for the eye
And the more a nigga try
You can find me stretched out

Believe them diamonds studded
Stay flooded like a damn
Chase grams cause I am what I am

Trying to get below the belt and beat it like a boxing jab
Hit it then I quit it like I dropped out of a boxing class
Know how we doing it, we been chopped and screwing it
Coming to get that number one spot you got like Ludacris
Know he acting groupie-ish taking a sip out Luda's Cris
We buy our own bottles, grab one and put it to your lips
Hating on your hood, throw your hood up, put it in his face
Reppin' Texas, got that real estate down in that realest state
Didn't need a bigger place, didn't need a bigger face
On my watch but forgot and went a got them both a place

Doing the same pose as Paris Hilton in them camera flicks (haha)
The mathematics get big cause I'm demanding it
Raping the rap game while these other suckers is romancing it
They worried about its feelings, they don't wanna take a chance with it
Kissing up to the game with rose petals and a candle lit haha

It's hard to keep in touch when you're off in school
But now you're right here we can do what we do
Start in the car and end up in the livin' room
Kiss around your navel while you're on the end table
Pushed the magazines down on the floor, I'm your soldier so I'm ready to go to war

And you told me you're hot and you're ready
Legs won't stop shakin', just give it to me daddy
And I like the way your body's lookin' right there
Knowin' we might not even make it upstairs
And what that means is just relax your mind and baby let it flow
It's goin' down and that's for sho

Not rough though, slowmo, promo
We could go video, uh uh true that's right
Nasty that's all in me, how he rappin' got women like he R and B
What you know about your legs in the air, with your head in the chair and my hands in your hair
We could go there if what I'm sayin' sounds fair
Don't trip, I kiss every lip, don't flip
Flip up the doors on the out-of-country whip
I could take you out of this world, baby let's dip

'Cause I want you in the middle of the night I'm gonna rub
And if you let me go down I'm gonna taste
And when it's all said and done I'm gonna you know what, you know what

It's for the money this time (Drama)

Howdy do motherfuckers, it's Weezy Baby
Niggas bitchin' and I gotta tote the cannon
Listen close I got duct tape and rope
I'll leave you missin' like the fuckin' O'Bannons
One hand on my money, on hand on my buddy
That's the A-K forty seven made his neighborhood love me
Bullets like birds you can hear them bitches hummin'
Don't let that bird shit, he got a weak stomach
Niggas know I'm sick I don't spit I vomit
Got it?
One egg short of the omelet
Simon says, shoot a nigga in his thigh and leg
And tell him catch up like mayonnaise, um
I'm the sickest nigga doin' it
Bet that baby
These other niggas dough I'm wet crack baby, yes
Get back get back boy this a set back
Clumsy ass niggas slip and fall into a death trap
Them boys pussy, born without a backbone
And if you strapped we can trade like the Dow Jones
Wet him up, I hope he got his towel on
I aim at the moon, and get my howl on
Some niggas cry wolf, I'm on that dry kush
And when it comes to that paper I stack books
You heard what I said
I can put you on your feet 
Or put some money on your head
Life ain't cheap
You're better off dead
If you can't pay the fee
Shout out my nigga fee
See every mother fucker at the door don't get a key
You outside lookin' in, so tell me what you see
Its about money its bigger than me
I told my homies don't kill him bring the nigga to me, yea
Don't miss, you fuckin' with the hit man
Kidnap a nigga make him feel like a kid again

The gat 
The strap 
The gun 
The tool

Other words I'm the real, for real
We can go check for check or bill for bill
We can go chick for chick or skill for skill
The deal is sealed
Niggas ain't real as Will cause I'm a (cannon)
And I handle well pedal like Cannondale
And I got the fifty cal mag its a hand-held
I'm tellin' you niggas I pop put a shell in you niggas
My nice watch'll Helen Keller you niggas
I got whores in the cannon camcorder bendin' over
Blowin' game by the quarter weed over in the Rover nigga

From Philly to where I'm landin I'm a cannon
And I'm on that Philly fire shit
Then I come fully equipped
You try me get bodied keep the shawty in the whip
If a nigga try to stick me I'm a blam him
Sing a long da da da di I'm free got the butters 
Got the green and got the tan got the whole enchilada
Homie know I'm inside of your house
Tie up your brother
Make the prick call up your mother 
She might know where to find you
I am, on top of my job
The heavyweight champ of the flow
Its flow like the ocean, open water you drownin'
I will, four pond 'em 
And sink them heat 'em and leave 'em stinkin'
Sharks surround them and eat them nice then know that I will
Roll over ya squad like I'm a one punch card
You chumps, you best call General Motors
I will, take control of your soldiers
You wont listen till I toss them in the wok like chicken
General toaster

This rap shit like diggin' in the register, dealin' with big embezzlers
Get it right, I'm better and better than my competitors
Ahead, another level up, me, I'm worth eleven plugs
I can stop rappin', ain't I already said enough?
The whole motherfuckin' game owe me, time to settle up
If I move forward a little slower, you'll be catching up
Man that's the shit you need to listen for
'Cause where I'm from niggas dumb, they'll give you what you're itching for
It's a issue with you, best to handle your business, bro
'Cause ain't no politicking when killas comin' to get you, bro
Hey, although, they don't know the whole fire
In the dark, shoot sparks like rim with no tire
I don't deal with the lames, I'd much rather blow by ya
They known to spit a lot of hot air like blow dryers
And I'm really off the wire, look at me, I'm on fire
Here's some useful information if you don't know sire
Snort that cake (cake), and I'm not fake (fake)
So you should strongly consider doin' an about-face
And if not all you gotta say is you wanna get busy
And I'm down, get wit' me, any time, pick a city

Next they hit a n**** in his head with this one 
I'm a paint the city red wit this one 
I'm a  head wit' this one 
See you f***in' wit' the boys who tote toys way before Christmas. 
No assistance (its) that persistence me. 
That commitment if, I don't get it somebody gone die tonight 
I know my vibe is tight,
And I deserve that thrown, 
And if the kid ain't right, 
Then let me die in this song, 
See I'll be ridin' (just) 
Ridin' alone 
Wit' my daddy on my mind like you gotta be kiddin' 
How the hell you ain't here to see ya prince do his thing 
Sometimes I wanna drop a tear but no emotions from a king 
She'll be 
So I be who I be

So I be who I be

My feet on the ground 
My fingers to the judge if the money don't move 
And I won't budge 
Won't budge 
No I won't budge no 
Na

Money is the motivation 
Facin' the avenue 
Back touchin' the wall 
Got the weed 
Got the gun 
Gotta run when I hear that bird call, dang 
Hop in that thang and merk off 
Swerve off 
You know me, they call me ""Birdman Junior""
Anybody murderer 
Birdman sponsor it 
Phantom of the opera 
All black gwop tent, locked in 
I can let them shots out 
You can't get no shots in 
Bullet proof 
Leave a n**** wit' a bullet roof
Shoot ya in ya mouth, Leroy they call 'em bullet tooth 
I'm like what it do
What to do
There's a full court pressure 
I'm just going for the two
If I'm open for the three 
I'm a take it in a second 
Even if there's one second and 
I'm a make it, it's nothin' 
I don't take it for granted 
I don't take it for nothin'. 
I take it for what it is worth to the durf motherf***er (yea)

I ain't never killed nobody I promise 
I promise if you try me 
You gone have to rewind this track and make me go back
That thing will go blat
That boy will lay flat so flat 
That act is what I perform amongst you haters 
Got Nina in my palm and I'm masturbatin'
Black Peter Pan flies too, I die, what you sayin' 
Bathing Ape, Yves Saint, Evisu, what I stay in
Got me feelin' like Scarface Like the Koheba 
Streets reply I look right in a four seater
You know I be out here ridin' a four seater
Top floor of the four seasons
Four of the whores 
And they all know how to cook it up 
Look I got some
But only one know how the bad b****, bundle up 
See its a cold world so homey bundle up 
We ain't on this grind for nothin'
So get ya hustle up.

In one night blew bezzle on charm money
Fuck it it's nothin' I'm still spendin Desert Storm money

Lil Wayne,"[Chorus]
Starts off like a small town marriage
Lovely wife and life, baby carriage
Now all the stars have cars,
Success of course
But it ends in Hollywood divorce
Hollywood divorce

(And I'm a star!)
Yeah, and I don't have to go to Hollywood
'Cause Hollywood come through my neighborhood with cameras on
I really think they're stealing from us like a sample song
I really wish one day we'd take it back like Hammer's home
The hurricane come and took my Louisiana home
And all I got in return was a darn country song
This whole country wrong,
Oh, but you right, if you just put a little ice on,
And cut your mic on
But you don't even write songs
But Hollywood make you spit like a python, I meant Cobra. 
I'm so not sober.
I'm high like a Hollywood coffee or soda.
You can call me a roller. (Hold up)
Your grill's glistenin'
Spent a hundred thousand on mine to feel different.
What's the real sense of it?
Bling bling, I know.
And did you know I'm the creator of the term?
I just straightened the perm
They let it sit too long. 
They just making it burn.
Make a movie of our lifestyle,
But they earn like a dead body burned on a mantelpiece
That's why I try not to lie on wax 
Like this candle grease
And I be's the little nigga
Cooler than anti-freeze 
Defrost on your window pane 
Lil Wayne
But in Hollywood it's Little Wayne
Don't make me nut
So that's why I got a pre-nup
(I do)

[Chorus]

(Yeah, Yeah)
A is for Adamsville
Be is Bowen Homes
See if I give a fuck 
If you like me you know I don't
If she ain't got a good head on her leave that ho alone
If she do got some good head on her let her sing a song
D is for what I serve, 
I don't be on no curb
She ain't no junkie neither
I ain't no dope dealer
But she keep coming back 
Three stacks must be some crack
Put that pipe in her lap 
She ain't know how to act
Now that I've got your un-
Divided attention I'm
Gonna say this and run 
Under condition one
Promise me you gon' stack 
Promise me you gon' ball
Promise me you'll invest 
Three fourths of it all
(For what?) 
So your kids' kids' kids can have some cheese
Can't get with it? 
Get get get get get on your knees
Cause 'wealth' is the word (yep)
'Rich' is 'round the corner from the curb
Don't like what I write? 
Shoot me a bird

Tenth grade 
The way was paved 
For me and Dre. to create
Like Dr. Frankenstein 
The arts and crafts
Now could we make a difference
Antoine Patton and Andre Benjamin
Been jamming for you crabbing rap niggas and journalists
That's quick to misprint 
Public and private business
Then retract back for deaf ears 
And think it's dismissed
Part two, the sequel 
All new cast
Just ain't the same 
Gang of nerds on the internet
Slandering your name 
Behind that screen name
They're lame 
And their life is pretty plain
M&M's with no nuts
Won't show up face-to-face 
Straight bitch made
Like puppies on the nipples of a mutt
Address it on a case-by-case basis like the judge
(What about these lyin' ass hoes tryin to plot?)
Or these niggas on the block who want the queen (Nigga please)
But even she can walk 
We'll miss her we ain't gon' fake it
But God don't make mistakes 
Must be something bigger waiting

[Chorus]

(I do) 
Love you but you hate me at the same time
Lights, camera, action, 
It's game time
Do you take this here 
As your lovely wife?
To love her and cherish her 
For all your life?
I solemnly swear to dare share 
Take you there
And me and you together 
Baby we a lucky pair
It's been a long time 
We walked a thin line
Others say they got you 
But you been mine
As I sit back and watch all them cat fights
Domestic violence (Is that right?)
But you love the dog
Gave me the spotlight
And now I'm growing up 
Showing up 
Blowing up
I never ever thought that we would separate at all
But you played me 
Like a game of football
Used to feed me 
Need me 
Dress me
Now it's so messy 
Straight cut out and left me

Hollywood divorce. 
All the fresh styles always start off as a good little hood thing.
Look at blues, rock, jazz, rap
Not even talking about music
Everything else too.
By the time it reach Hollywood it's over.
But it's cool.
We just keep it going and make new shit.

Take our game
Take our name
Give us a little fame
And then they kick us to the curb

Twenty on a bike, third world peace

Fo' five fo' a pound of that leaf
A hundred dollaz for a chopper on the streets
We uptown, we gon' ride 'til we die nigga
We stay fresh, get money stay fly nigga

Burn it and light it then we dip it and we hit it, nigga.

Where I'm from, we see a fucking dead body everyday
That's uptown, throw a stack at 'em
Make a song about me, I'm throwing shots back at 'em
Ya bitch on my pipe, and she like a crack addict
And she saw me cooking eggs, and she though I was back at it
I grab the keys, ho, I gotta go
I got my motorcycle jacket and my motorcycle loafs

[Chorus]

98's, forty-five paper plates
Ten, the whole thing, big money heavy weight
A hundred stacks, spend fifty on a caddy, twenty-five on the pinky
Bought a pound of blow, and bounced back
Matching grills, big houses on the hill
Got them hos in the kitchen all cooking, paying bills
On stunner island, dollar after dollar
Flipping chickens, getting tickets, want the money and the power
Born stunner, uptown hunter
Third ward G's, nigga, been about money
Ice chunks, Birdman, red monkeys
White tees on them chromed out eleven hundreds
You know we shine every summer, we grind every summer
And this is how we spend money
You see them Bentleys and them Lambs'
Them ounces and them grams, bitch, we was born hustlers

[Chorus]

When I was sixteen, I bought my first Mercedes Benz
I must've fucked a thousand bitches and they girlfriends
White leather, hot new pair of rims, 
Brand new pistol with the trigger like a hair pin
Big work, we don't need scale, man
Big papers, say good morning to the mail man
What you now 'bout putting bricks in the spare, man?
I can stuff a coupe like a motherfucking caravan
I'm in my zone, my form is so rare, man
If there's a throne, you're looking at a chairman
How you want it? Show me my opponent, show me my opponent
I'm still balling, a bullet gotta get me 
And I've never been a pussy 'cause my hood'd never let me
A made nigga, got made niggas wit' me
I am a motorcycle boy, so I'm about to pop a wheelie

Don't offer me reefer unless you know the flame proper
You know I'm in somethin' sick when you see the Twista pop off
Fucked up off juice and vodka and high as a helicopter

In the grape jelly Jag or peanut butter Bentley
Or ruby Hummer 'cause a few bitches is comin' with me
Or break down slowly I'm stallin' off in the stick shift
Mwah, give my rims a kiss, they got big lips

Now tear the guts out, bricks'll get served
Like ostrich interior because I'm sittin' on the biggest birds
Vocalistic cataclysms, I spit the biggest words
Fuck you and your bitch ass crew, I spit the sickest verbs

Thuggin' like I will pack up my five and go blaka-blaka
Do anythin' a nigga gots to do to protect my product
When you call the cops up
I'll be gone before they search through my Prada

Because I don't want the drama, don't wanna holla at your honor
So under the seat I'ma carry the llama and then I peel off in my Impala
I'm a Jeff Gordon slash chef, sorry I gots to peel sharp
Behind the wheel or the stove I whip it real hard

To lick it real hard, give the shorties real jobs

Lil Wayne,"Hello Brooklyn!

Hello Brooklyn how you doing
Where you going and can I come too
And if I can I'ma be your man
You could be my lady and have my baby
And drive my car and drive me crazy
Wherever your going baby girl just take me
Cause I'm so taken if you taken
I'm just saying baby I'm just saying

Like a mamma you birthed me, Brooklyn you nursed me
Schooled me with hard knocks, better than Burkley
They say you murked me by the time I was 21
That shit disturbed me, but you never hurt me
Hello Brooklyn, if we had a daughter
Guess what I'ma call her, Brooklyn carter
When I left you for Virginia it didn't offend ya
Cause you know I only stepped out to get dinner
And I'm eating, so much I bought extra
So much so that dinners now turned into breakfast
I only roll Lexus to hug your road
I love your corners, I'm half your soul
Hello Brooklyn

Hello Brooklyn how you doing
Where you going and can I come too
And if I can I'ma be your man
You could be my lady and have my baby
And drive my car and drive me crazy
Wherever your going baby girl just take me
Cause I'm so taken if you taken
I'm just saying baby I'm just saying

Hello Brooklyn

Whats your story, she said she's eating on the run but she ain't Nore
She said she's got a man but he ain't worried
But baby I'ma have to rob him like Orie
She said she love B.I.G. and she likes Tupac
And when I said Jay-Z she said it's the Roc
I'ma leave it like this like this like that
Where Brooklyn at, where Brooklyn at
Have you seen her, and when she tell you something you better believe her
She told me she like my new Orleans demeanor
And so I said goodbye Katrina and hello Brooklyn

But baby you are the sweetest site eyes could see
I said hello Brooklyn, but baby I hope you never say goodbye to me
I said hello Brooklyn, but baby you are so damn fine to me
And I remember the time, place and the weather from the day you said hi to me
And I say hello Brooklyn

Brooklyn you crazy look how you made me
Razor blades in my mouth walking 'round behaving
Or demented black hoodies and timberland'd
Always scheming you see the gleam on that niggas pendant
Hello Brooklyn, you bad influence
Look what you had me doing
But I ain't mad at you, look at my attitude it says my life's too real
Check out my ice grill baby I'm cold as ice
I come from Brownsville but my ""beds in the 'stye""
Blow la la ""flatten your bush"" till we smoking c.i.
What up to the boy d.i. you know I handle B.I.
I don't half step on the 'caine, ask the dreads 'bout I
How you want it slow she like it hard cold
So I grind slow iller than out in square mall back in the 9-0
My fine hoe we got some victims to catch
So in a couple years baby I'ma bring you some next

Hello Brooklyn how you doing
Where you going and can I come too
And if I can I'ma be your man
You could be my lady and have my baby
And drive my car and drive me crazy
Wherever your going baby girl just take me
Cause I'm so taken if you taken
I'm just saying baby I'm just saying

But baby you are the sweetest site eyes could see

And I remember the time, place and the weather from the day you said hi to me

High school she was that girl that make me do the hula hoop around the gym
(Just to get a peek again, she's a 10)
High school she was
That girl that make me do the hula hoop around the gym
(Just to get a peek again, she's a 10)
Never thought that she would come and work for the president
Mr. George Washington (where my money at?)
She thought he'd call (where my money at?)
She had a good day, bad day, sunny day, rainy day
All he wanna know is is (where my money at?)
Closed legs don't get fed, go out there and make my bread
All he wanna know is (where my money at?)
She ended up in a road car, bruised up, scarred hard
All he wanna know is (where my money at?)

[Verse 2: (Akon)]
Pimpin' got harder cos, hoes got smarter
On the strip is something they don't wanna be a part of
Rather be up in the club shakin' for some dub
Then triple times the money and spending it like they wanna
They got they mind on they money, money on they mind
They got they finger on the trigger, hand on the nines
See everyday they feel the struggle, but staying on they grind
And ain't nobody takin' from us, and that's the bottom line

But I know there's a drop in the block
You move slow
You getting' pressure from cops
you don't know not to lay low
Because 25 to life is no joke
To all my real gorillas thuggin'
On top of corners every day strugglin'
All the beautiful women getting' money

Now she like sour ameretta
She wears a dress to the T like the letter
And if you make it rain she will be under the weather
She used to run track back in high school
Now she tricks off the track right by school
She takes a loss cos she don't wanna see her child lose
So respect her, I'll pay up for the time used
And then she runs to the pastor
And he tells her there will be a new chapter
But she feels no different after
And then she asks him... where my money at?

Got my vote, I'm feelin' ya campaign
I like you, but I really like your damn chain

It kinda explains the way she be actin'
She liked my necklace so she started relaxin'
Now, that's what the fuck I call a chain reaction

[Fabolous]
Yo, you think they like me now, wait until the light hit me
I bet the house somebody's girl spend the night with me
They gotta love it, if not, then I guess they haters
This kinda necklace turn on the investigators
They ain't got one problem with this
Square face watch look like sponge bob on the wrist
One white, one gold, one nice, untold
You could look, but don't touch, guns might unload, now
I respect them thugs who get they jackin' on
But we squeeze to every slug that we be packin', son
Ya boy got the drug money we be stackin' on
Lotta carrots, not the one's Bugs Bunny snackin' on
Got 'em gettin' close, and lookin' like a scooped-up
The titanic chain from the bottom of the ocean
I play them diamonds well when I got that jewelery on
They should call me Carat Jeter, maybe Canary Bonds

Oh, she actin' real reckless right now
Let me at this bitch, man, let's go
Damn, what happened? He blinded everybody
It must be Jeezy, outshinin' everybody
Yeah, I'm fretted for the show
You could call me the light man
(Diamonds in my damn chain)
You could call me the bright man
Yeah, I don't do bright links, I do AP's
Yeah, I spit cheese on all these VV's
Blow an old G, yeah, I got it from home
Twenty carat pinky ring, shit, I got it robbin'
(Break yourself, nigga) We have to step it up a notch
Iced-out ski-mask, placed in the projects to hide my weed stash
Dominican shit, shit, I got it from fans
Yo, the stone is in my chain, so I call it the cab

[Chorus]

[Fabolous]
Yo, maybe it's them VV's 'cause they sets susters
Sit on the next bus like the show on MTV
The wings on the chain make a nigga fly
Like the wings on a plane when you sittin' in between 'em
They hittin' when you clean 'em, glitterin' when you seen 'em
Beemin' through the tints when I'm sittin' in the ""Phenom""
Oops, I mean Phantom; my words got tangled, man
But this tiger stripe watch make this bitch a Bengals fan
We all know Jacob; check the shit he did
He spent more time making the band than Diddy did
You feel my campaign, then drop your old spouse
I'm out in DC at the white and gold house
Wanna convince me, love? Secret service me with some of that Lewinsky love
She saw the chain, gave me brain, no strain ever since
Now that's what I call a real chain of events, nigga

While ya blinking, have ya bopper looking like you been drinking

So when they speaking on it all they gon' speak of is a beaster boy
So don't make me just treat ya to a feast

A beast'll just beat off both of your ear drums

Now she tricks off the track right by school
She takes a loss 'cause she don't wanna see her child lose
So respect her, I'll pay up for the time used

And he tells her there will be a new chapter
But she feels no different after
And then she asks him, where my money at?

You can talk that talk, but I'ma walk that walk

I was a rider, that's fa sho

We them niggas getting hated by haters, we them niggas that done made it outrageous
Stack the money in the streets nothing honey nothing sweet, I'm sick my chips contagious
Animals none of y'all can't cage us, got me feeling like the Heat and the Lakers
Had to switch up my team but what do ya mean, we already traded them traitors
Spend a lifetime surrounded by fakers, in the night time you high 'cause it's safer 
Spend a lifetime to grind and get paper, while all y'all crying I'm flying to Jamaica
Grinding steadily fine and cheddar he, know how to show ya the nine is deadly
Wanna be a pussy nigga fine then let it be, anybody crying that's around it's never me
Realer than the rest when it come to plex, get it off your chest if you so upset
Is that what it gon' be if it comes to yes, then I guess that day will become a mess
They messed up when they told me the sky's the limit, 
'cause I'm married to my money nigga I'm committed
If it's gold at the end of the rainbow then my gang go, get up in the vehicles and ride to get it
I'm a nigga that made it up from the bottom, I'm a always get into a lil' drama
Y'all don't know what it means to be a rider, gotta deal with anybody that got a problem

I don't know what you do fo' yo checks, but my part of the do' way mo' they less
I'm gripping wood I know I'm fresh, 'cause I am that CEO and yes
The mo' I make they more upset, but I'll be damned if a nigga don't show respect
Ask the streets in the South about the kid, and they gon' tell ya I be doing my thang
We could do the beef or we could do the peace, as long as you ain't speaking my name
My partna told me you was jocking homie, and my other boy said the same
The result of that when I approached the cat, I gotta hit him with the pain like bang-bang
Physically and mentally, a rider a nigga that'll tell 'em see
I bomb on your ass it was meant to be, because I told y'all niggas not to mess with me
Do you let the beef slide, and let it die down with all your deciding
In the streets they know Cha-millionaire be riding, Batman my heat riding like Robin
Tell 'em that I got 'em if he's on my team, 'cause loyalty's something that you're gonna need
Loyalty's something others don't believe, like a ghost that most suckers ain't known to seen

I put them words back down yo throat
I don't care where you stay
Nigga I'm from uptown!
I gotta get 'em slim
They talkin' beef to me
They just a bunch of bitches
They talkin' sweet to me
Pussy niggas
I guess I gotta eat pussy
Put a hole in 'em
Now that's a deep pussy
The cops hate me
But a star's born
The streets love me
But how long will it morn
Imma real nigga
Say real nigga thangs
Bullet don't have no name

[Chorus]

I never fold
But I just take my chance
I let life deal
And I just pay my hand
Protection off safe
I look straight ahead
""I got them niggas weezy""
That's what the 380 said
You gotta play in the field to get paid
And then you gotta go lay in that bed that u made
This cashmoney this that army bregay
And I'm spittin like I ate a grenade
I'm dippin in that apron to fade
Hittin 4 with the butt[weed butt]
Put the wings up and straight show em my gutt
Hate my swagga so mean
And I kno how to operate that machine
(bllllllllllllrrrrrrr)

[Chorus]

Aim at his brain
Make a nigga learn
And if that's choppa bullets
Then they suppose to burn
And if you went in jail
I never saw I cell
But I come from New Orleans
Yea right there under hell
Tell my gal don't you worry 'bout nothin'
But see these niggas want me dead
So hold me tight when ya fuck me
I told her I'm straped Imma rider girl
And Imma shoot from every side like around the world
Um believe that and you can tell 'em bring the whole gang
I'm gon give you that automatic touchin' errthang
Nigga its the bird mane
Jr pure pain
You're just just a curve stain

Coca Bitch!
Here is something you can't understand.
How I can just kill a man.
Shame what the mack can do, K's spit faster.
I'll make an ass of you, save the theatrics.
Watch like a quarter mil, chain like double that.
I ain't gotta to talk about the half up in the duffel bag.
Stunna my brother, Weezy Wee the syndicate.
Hundred Phantoms, hundred Maybachs, I guess we're nigga rich.
I'll yellow bottle your face in, trust me.
Look at all the shit I be talking and no one touched me.
""Pray and pray for my downfall""
BIG said it, so I made it rain till it poured.
Speak from the heart, this emotional rap.
Catch feelings when you hear me, I'm supposed to do that. Crack!
A G what the streets done made me.
And the only language I speak is ""Fuck You Pay Me!""
Bitch!

And when me come them say hey!
See me point that gun at y'all me no play!
Me come for murder them all the cowboy way!
Me lick a shot sprayed from me set me make way!

Peer gunshot army them make backup!
A man no fear no man, man no fear no one!
Man a real Islam, man a get down done!
A me no hear them talk, me eat in me car!
Respect a soldier, him in a middle of war!
Me I'm a Babylon gangster, holly grove monster
You no look familiar, roofers them kill ya!
Gunshots I will cut then open toolbox and drill ya!
Jump off body and let the mailman meal ya!
Me think I'm gon need the almighty one to heal ya!
And me behind the jungle with the lion and we killa!

Yup! Put it in the air nigga.
Light your lighters in the air.
This for my dead homies.
Yeah!

""Gangsta Gangsta"" that's what we yelling!
Shoot him in his head, let his bitch go and tell them!
We in the hood, getting money, we swelling
Bigger than life, you know it's the cheaper price
Bigger your stripes, you know what we doing tonight
We getting it right, we plan, then hit, then flight
We know the rules nigga, live by none
Get it by none, bitch I'll kill for my son

Yeah! Gangsters don't live that long.
That's why we gotta party everyday like Frank came home.
And it's hard for me to say that my heart ain't yearning.
To walk up in a church and believe the sermon.
But instead, I spark up and relieve the burning.
Hoping that he understands my reasons for it.
No, I ain't evil, I'm equal.
And nigga I ain't sweet, motherfucker I'm diesel!

And when me come them say Hey!

Rock star! (rock on)
Rock star! (rock on)
It's rock n roll! (rock on!)

I got ladies that love my ladies
Haters that hate my haters
I'm a Chamillionaire, but got billionaires for my neighbors (Rock On)
I been havin' paper, I been havin' stacks
The crowd screamin' loud in every city on the map
Got the groupies goin' crazy, they don't know how to act
I bring em backstage and tell em baby just relax

Rock on, they see the jewels is so sick,l like flu spit and flu cough
Take it off and you lost, the tough talk get tooled off
Keep the four iron near, keep on thinkin' that it's for golf
Nickel Plate on your head, silverware's food for thought
Grammy winner the haters is like 'How could this happen?' (how?)
On the red carpet so much they mistake me for Aladdin (wow?)
How I'm a rapper with revenue like a rock star?
If I'm near you can believe the black card is not far
'Teen Spirit' ain't what they smellin', they yellin' 'Where that Nirvana?'
The crowd is rockin' n rollin', them swishers full of marijuana
They judgin' me like your honor, your daughter's here with her mama
They tell me that I'm a charmer, more freakier than Madonna
Famous look right at me and said 'Know why I got my lighter up?'
Cause like the throwback P. Diddy alias I'm a 'Puff'
See how we rippin up tickets that police be writin us
Do like Michael Jackson's complexion Mr. and lighten up

[Chorus]
Ladies love it when your livin' like a rock star
I got em screamin' loud as they be screamin' comin' out broads daily
Ladies love it when your livin' like a rock star
She's sayin' she's in love with me and she is probably your lady
Like a rockstar (Lady)
Like a rockstar (Lady)
Ladies love it when your livin' like a rock star (Baby)
Catch me gettin' into trouble like it's my job (Baby)
When they listen to the cops come then I'ma (Rock On!)

That Double R lean
And if it's for me
Then its foreign
I mean my cars, I mean my clothes
I mean my hos, I mean my flows
You dress different round then me I'm a clean your nose
Step into the line of fire hide the penal code
Compared to big foot, you just twinkle toes
I get ya girlfriend wet like wrinkled clothes
Rock star like, money, drugs, freaky hos
World tours, walkthroughs and T.V. shows
My hair's out (Hey!)
No Shirt (Hey!)

I'm on my hot shit
Reportin' to you live from the mosh pit

I'm so cool, I'm so smooth, I'm that dude, I'm so fly
Groupies tellin' me like a spy, the ground be tellin' me that I'm fly
The cloud see me and they cry just to get a glimpse of I
Got Mother nature so jealous she knockin' pigeons out the sky
Can't help it, i got em rockin' they pelvic-bones
And losin' clothes
The higher my album sales get
They love me, that's right you nailed it
They treatin' me like I'm Elvis
Naked pictures she mailed
She licked on a stamp and melted
So save your rap for the rookies, 'cause there ain't no rappers here
A show you do in a club is a show we do in the ampitheatre
We packin' stadiums, ladies come in I'll introduce ya
It's too packed to maneuver, crowd look like LaLaPalooza
We outshinin' the losers, know i ride with the Ruger
You know I'ma producer, weapon upside ya medulla
Got no time to seduce a Super Head type of seducer
Groupies tyrin' to snake me, but Koopa denyin' Medusas

Everybody know each other if not they related
You can get shot or get bladed
There's dudes that got jobs now that had blocks in the eighties
Six months five years for you just to cop out
Ninth or tenth grade is usually when niggas drop out
Fights break out when you wired and start joking
A lot of OG's retired and started smokin'
House party games of spade sweet kool-aid
Loud music all night till the boys in blue raid
So therefore I could never be too paid
I know where I'm going and where I'm from will get you laid

Tell me this how come
Black folks get a little doe
And forget where they come from
Man we used to have good times
But since you moved on up you ain't cool with us
We still support you tho we don't see you much
You ain't the first fool its cool with us
But why you living out your idols dreams
Remember how for you came and help you keep those thangs
Now its cool that your address changed
But I'm tryna holla at my dog and the number ain't the same
I guess new homies came with his fame
But see true homies will stay the same
Through all the up's and down's in your career
A couple wives few kids scattered here
And when you dead or broke without a deal
All the groupies cleared
The ghetto will still be here

Yea I still love you baby
Yo, yo, yo the story gets crazy but in the beginning the shit was all gravy my girlfriend she straight up from Brooklyn type of chick jus to kill another bitch just for looking she's so Brooklyn she so crazy I swear to god man I love my baby,
But you could all ways catch a nigga hanging out I was in the late night spot smoking out. That's when I saw this girl she was leaning, she was kind of tipsy from the drink she was drinking, she was looking then she started winking,
Thinking to my self man I probably shouldn't be here I got her name then I got her number, I should be ashamed because I went home and called her, now we on the phone telling me she older said she from the Bronx and she want me to come over I was like

[Chorus]
Dam I can't believe I...dam I can't believe I... dam I can't believe I... dam I can't believe I cheated on my woman with a girl from the Bronx

Man this shit gets deeper I hoped on the subway jus to go meet her she was looking like a wannabe diva freaky lil bitch borderline skuzzier,
My girlfriend she wasn't hesitating she blowing up my phone ever second we was hanging..
She so inpatient she's on probation I swear to god man I love my baby,
But I always spend my time hanging out sawp chilling with this hoe in the Bronx digging her out.
Fucked her in the kitchen, hit it on the couch, I can't forget to mention I put it in her mouth.
And now it's a long ride home I know I was so damn wrong... but dam I had so much fun.
My girl kept calling my phone I'm thinking about what I've done.

[Chorus]
Dam I can't believe I...dam I can't believe I... dam I can't believe I... dam I can't believe I cheated on my woman with a girl from the Bronx

The next day I thought shit was all over but my girlfriend giving me the cold shoulder said she found some empty condom rappers in the rova, now she throwin fits telling me to go,
Crying in the bed room burning all my cloths taking all my shoes and put 'em on the stove all in the kitchen looks like a furnace...
Ten minutes later whole house burning, and now you see me in a robe running out and you can here the police coming without a doubt.
The cops saw us fussing my girl was tripping hard, they locked me up in handcuffs threw me in the car, and now I know that
It's over I called her over and over she won't answer my call's I thought my pimping days were over, I stood up only to fall.

Oh, Rich Boy, you niggas better get focused
Get money, muthafucka, get money, muthafucka

Let me take ya through my hood where I was born and raised
Where niggas tote semi-automatics, bustin' them K's
Heavy guns and dope boys harassed by the police
Still gettin' pulled over and asked by the police

'Bama wasn't made for a nigga to win
See the color of ya skin get 'cha put in the pen
It's real life, over dice, Dwayne dead and gone
Sendin' niggas to the pen or the funeral home

I be feelin' like the Lord'll never answer me back
So I'm holdin' on my gat just in case they attack
Bullet holes in ya house'll make it hard to sleep
Ya see the fiends on the street want the hard for cheap

'Lotta niggas doin' life from under covers and fake friends
It's real how them penitentiary bars'll break men
Niggas doin' life from under covers and fake friends
It's real how them penitentiary bars'll break men

It's where you learn your favorite slang
Your world is ghetto

It's where I live, it's where I'm from
It's where you had to tote your gun
Your world is ghetto

Can't explain how I feel growin' up in the gutter
Told my mama that I love her put nobody above her
Doin' crimes, a hard time for food on the plate
Know a couple of niggas ain't never comin' out the gate

Movin' weight the only thing them street niggas know
Servin' thangs at school, they never teach 'em, don't show
But a 44'll get 'cha money fast from robbin'
Do or die situation when ya tired, be stavin'

Government'd never send me a dime for school
So I went and started workin' like my nine my tool
I'm a leader for the South, pa, open ya ears

I'm a product of the block, watch the fiends come back
Got a couple white packs 'cause they fiend for that
Early five in the mornin', pigs showin' they badge
Real niggas in the street still showin' they rags

Speed bumps in the road start slowin' me down
See them fake niggas actin' like they know me now
Got a chance to advance, so I'm makin' my move
Couple o' people still thinkin' they got somethin' to prove

Pay the card for the South, yeah the hood my home
Told my mama I'ma leave the dope game alone
On my knees every night conversatin' wit God
Niggas dyin' everyday 'cause they wanna be hard

Still totin' my piece 'cause it ain't nothin' like the movies
I'm wearin' my vest in case they hit me wit the Uzi
Even if I take a trip around the world and back
I'm representin' for the hoods where they feel me at

They don?t seem to want me but they won?t admit
I think I?m some kind of creature that they are having fear of
Hard times
There's no love to be found

[The Game]
I?m feeling like a black Democrat, 
Barack Obama but the only nigga that can catch Osama
Spray lambas and get good head and fuck fly bitches with no covenant
Only the kitchen oven and rules to the government
Ask the republicans how crack cocaine get smuggled in?
Watch them throw they hands up and say it wasn?t them
As for rap, this is my lyrical asthma attack
It?s all I know, the guns, the cash, the dro
Fidel Castro on my own right, capone like 
My fioso been franky on the low pro.
Drop top Bentley, chromed out semi
Two ran on popular demand like the first penny
My order more PK, wrist saying kinda deep 
Throw DJ quake, tell em other niggas to taste this
Who the buck 50 what?s coming out the speakers 
Got every video bitch scared the fuck of me

[Chorus]
Having hard times
There?s no love to be found
Having hard times 
There no love to be found

[Lil Wayne]
Shit gangster to the core
Ain?t no rap flame paint your kitchen floor
What you, you can?t ignore 
Things you endure went up against the board
All I hard was easy don?t feel me no more
I hear your bullshit I play mad at door
I?m outta category I ain?t there with you
I got a positive vibe I ain?t scared of yours
Hit the kid nigga they?ve never did it wrong 
I got a girl so fine her name Perrignon
She know how to get them thangs and carry on
I blow outta town when gas is outta town
Uptown in the building how that sounds
Cause killas don?t get dirty about
They get whispered about and get murdered about boi

[Chorus]
Having hard times
There?s no love to be found
Having hard times 
There no love to be found

[Lil Wayne]
You got it on your mind look daddy say something
All I played buttoned get your face buttoned up
And now when you smirk you look like Jay Z?s shirt
Sippin on turf

[The Game]
Give them hard taking tampons
Shot of patron and don
The ones trained get ran on my crew hard 
Louis V sweaters on the boulevard
Poor niggas cars throw up signs and bang on

[Lil Wayne]
They call me J.R. I tell em come holla
I tell my poppa put away your dollars your son got choppers
And if you get enemy?s your son got enemies that uptown energy

Niggas never gon be on my level
Get a shovel dig a hole 
Bitch impala with he devil you an acquired hustler

Like what the hell am I doing right?

Walked through the gates of hell,
See my Impala parked in front,
With the high beams on.
Me and the devil
Sharing chronic blunts.
Listening to The Chronic album,
Playin' backwards.
Shootin' at pictures of Don Imus
For target practice.
My mind fucked up, so I
Cover it with a Raider hood.
I'm from the city that made you
Motherfuckers afraid of Suge
Made my Grandmother pray for good
And never made her happy,
But I bet that new Mercedes could.
Ain't no bars, but niggas can't
Escape the hood.
They took so many of my niggas,
That I should hate the hood.
But it's real niggas like me
That make the hood.
Ridin' slow in that Phantom
Just the way I should.
With the top back
And my Sox hat.
I'm Paid in Full,
The nigga Alvo couldn't stop that.
Even if they brought the nigga Pac back,
I'd still keep this motherfucker cocked back.

And I'm grindin' until I'm tired
And you ain't grindin' until you tired
So I'm grinding with my eyes wide
Looking to find,
A way through the day
The life of the night

You haven't taken my life?
Like what the hell am I doing right?
My life

Take me away from the hood like a state penitentiary
Take me away from the hood in the casket or a Bentley
Take me away like I overdosed on cocaine
Or take me away like a bullet from Kurt Cobain

Suicide, I'm from a Windy City, like ""Do or Die""
From a block close to where Biggie was crucified
That was Brooklyn's Jesus shot for no fuckin' reason
And you wonder why Kanye wears Jesus pieces?
My life

'Cause that's Jesus? people and The Game, he's the equal
Hated on so much, ""The Passion of Christ"" need a sequel
Yeah, like Roc-a-fella needed Sigel
Like I needed my father, but he needed a needle
My life

I need some meditation, so I can leave my people
They askin' ?Why? Why did John Lennon leave The Beatles?
And why every hood nigga feed off evil??
Answer my question before this bullet leave this Desert Eagle

And I'm grindin? until I'm tired

We are not the same, I am a Martian
So approach my Phantom doors with caution
You see them 24's spinnin'? I earned them
And I ain't no preacher, but here's my Erick Sermon

So eat this black music, and tell me how it taste, now
And fuck Jesse Jackson ?cause it ain't about race, now
Sometimes I think about my life with my face down
Then I see my sons and put on that Kanye smile
My life

Damn, I know his momma's proud
And since you helped me sell my dream, we can share my momma now
And like MJB, ""No More Drama"" now
Livin? the good life, me and Common on common ground

I spit crack and niggas could drive it outta town
Gotta Chris Paul mind state, I'm never outta bounds
My life used to be empty like a glock without a round
Now my life full, like a chopper with a thousand rounds

And I'm grindin? until I'm tired
They say, ""You ain't grindin? until you tired""

Hood",I'm So Hood,2008
Lil Wayne,"[Chorus]
I've been lonely
I've been waiting for you
I'm pretending
And thats all I can do
The love I'm sending ain't making it through to your hear

I shed tears cause im told that they'll heal
You tell the truth I don't know how to feel
Never felt alone in a room full of friends
Got big plans but you leave em in suspense
Pray for me, patience wait for me
Pay dues, trust me they aint comin
Way back it was hoops, now its maybach coups
And we all took a vow, no squares in the loops
Now we lookin at each other, sittin in a court room
I'm laughin, cause its lookin like a cartoon
Never snitch, got it tattooed by kartoo?
(somebody switch) by my rules we all lose

[Chorus]
You've been hiding, never letting it show
Always trying, to keep it under control
You got it down, and your well on your way to the top
But there is something you forgot

Flippin through magazines, ridiculed for my life
But they keep takin pictures of my jewells in the light
100g's in the night, entertainin big timers
'Cause my 1 liners rude like don imus
Smellin ros on my breath, ex ? fell asleep in his bed
Habits we developed livin lavish stackin mail up
Clothes come from big n tall ?
Got live life, tryna live life,
Penthouse for a pimp, only drove the benz twice
Convertible to the cars, cause I murdered all of ours
Get 50 collect calls from dawgs behind bars

[Chorus]
You've been hiding, never letting it show
Always trying
To keep it under control
You got it down
And your well on your way to the top
(trilllllaaaaaaaaaa..ross)
But theres something you forgot

Fortune n fame are pleasures you couldn't fathem
But fortunately for me my fortune built me a palace
Benjamins by the pallet, im spendin em mighty daily
I know I'm under sureveillance ( I look at it as a talent)
Millions a gotta manage, lil talents up in the rappin
Im such a threat to these n*ggaz (you never know what could happen)
I started without a coin, not knowin which way im goin
Now im chowderin ?, n readin em a few poems
Weathered all of the storms, now its time to see the light
I never felt this way bout anythin in my life
Determined to be the best, not lookin back at regrets
How many people you blessed is how you measure success

[Chorus]

I've been waiting for you
I'm pretending, and that's all I can do

Even as a young'n they consigned me to blow
Witches claims why I'm worth my weight in gold
While they was taking baby steps from an 8th to an O
Word in the streets that can envy as me
Enough ice on that watch to make a nigga lose sleep
Magnified face help the bitch see clearly

Nigga sittin' on the toilet bitch get off the pot
The bird just landed so the hood gon' rot
New whips, big chips the Prada Gucci shit
But mami your fly Benz the wide skinny lips
She takes my flight she holds my weight
While the po-po staked out from state to state
It ain't nothin' to a baller baby
Pay the cars, big money, heavy weight, bird man, hood boss
Baby steppin on my line I'll show a little somethin'
They callin' you don't come out 
Then the black crow will touch ya (touch ya)

Another soul lost
Had to make a shirt match my ox blood colored Porsche
The rims match of course
Blood hit his Timbs it reminded me of them
Glistenin' wrist on chiller
Gun in the same palm of gorgeous killer
I put this on my lord my niece was 4 when she felt chinchilla
I past the shore for that shit that made fiends rise from the dead like 
Thriller
Gangster, hustler
At night still found time to kiss my mother
Live like I'm dreamin' kick my feet up
Gun pulled my waist remind me of my demon
So quite ya yappin' fore I get to clappin'

I'm a full time hustla posted on the block, 
Got to get it how I live and I'm never going to stop.
Now that's gangsta, now that's gangsta
When me ride through the hood you can here the bass knock, 
All me girls them love me have me have city locked
Now that's gangsta, now that's gangsta

[Verse 1]
Mane I'm a gangsta, g-a-n-g-s-t-a mane, 
A gangsta the best to come up out of PA mane, 
A gangsta seldom seen but always heard, 
A real gangsta more than just a 7 letter word, 
A gangsta ain't ya clothes, 
A gangsta ain't ya hat, your watch ring your chain naw a gangsta ain't that, 
A gangsta can have that but he ain't got to show it, 
Cause with or without it hes still gangsta and you know it, 
From my head to my toe with it it ain't to hard to see, 
Said I'm a gangsta ain't too many as hard as me, 
You claimin g but you ain't gangsta jack 
So tell all them fake gangstas I'm coming to take gangsta back.

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
Mane I'm a gangsta now let me tell you what that means, 
See I'm a gangsta always got my mind on my green, 
And I'm a gangsta always gon do what I got to do, 
Unless it's giving game to police and sellin' out his crew, 
That's something gangstas don't do a gangsta keep it trill 
A gangsta do a crime he do his time on the real, 
A gangsta don't squeal and tell on everyone he know, 
Put a jacket on ya boy you ain't a gangsta yous a hoe, 
A gangsta hold his homeboys down when they gone, 
A gangsta put him back on his feet when he home, 
A gangsta is a homeboy that never turn his back, 
On another real homie and that's a well known fact
That thats gangsta

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Mane I'm a gangsta call me the hood superstar, 
And I'm a gangsta ridin' in my candy painted car, 
Cause see a gangsta always down to rep for his hood, 
And to do a little bad so I can do a little good, 
A gangsta don't forget where he came from 
No matter where he go or where he been keep it gangsta till the end, 
Cause I'm a gangsta and I'm a always love my city, 
Make money but don't act like I'm above my city, 
Cause gangstas will always give back to the ghetto, 
And gangstas will never turn their back to the ghetto, 
That's a fact in the ghetto, it's never been a lie,

Never know when you finna blow

Do you scrape up the curb
Then was sippin' some syrup
Then was blisted, twisted, since this pimp got in that heard
But I handle my issue
I got several pistols
That won't whistle, missiles not grisled from fatty tissue
Mississippi's my home
Till I'm die and I'm gone
I know I put it on my back, held that bitch up alone
Put no lable but docking

Yeeaahh, word to my Gucc (Gucci) boots, 
I'm higher than a new suit

Now how ya like me now

Buck forty on a ring that I don't really wear
But I bet it light up the night like the city fair
This shit ain't fair, I didn't have to go there
But all this ice got me feelin' like a polar bear
I'm so aware, I'm so prepared, 
I'm so fly I will take off into the open air
Lift off, Cristal, please, crackers with cheese
Nigga please, we on J-E-Ts like Curtis Martin and Whitley Green

Lil Wayne,"I see your dirty face, high behind your collar
What is done in vain, truth is hard to swallow
So you pray to God
To justify the way you live a lie, live a lie, live a lie
And you take your time and you do your crime
Well you made your bed, I'm in mine

Because when I arrive
I bring the fire, make you come alive
I can take you higher what this is, forgot?
I must now remind you let it rock, let it rock, let it rock

Now the son's disgraced
He, who knew his father
When he cursed his name
Turned, and chased the dollar
But it broke his heart
So he stuck his middle finger
To the world, to the world to the world
And you take your time and you stand in line
Well you'll get what's yours, I got mine

Because when I arrive
I bring the fire, make you come alive
I can take you higher what this is, forgot?
I must now remind you let it rock, let it rock, let it rock

Yeah! Wayne's world
Planet Rock, panties drop
And the tops and she gonna rock 'til the camera stop
And I sing about angels like Angela (rock) and Pamela (rock)
And Samantha (rock) and Amanda and Tamara
I'm in here up like bitch what's up
Mechanic, me, I can fix you up
I can fuck you up, I can fuck you down
Shorty we can go wherever just pick a town
And the jewelry is louder than an engine sound
Big ass rocks like on the ground
Dirty like socks that's on the ground, Weezy

Because when I arrive
I bring the fire, make you come alive
I can take you higher what this is, forgot?
I must now remind you let it rock, let it rock, let it rock

Because when I arrive
I bring the fire, make you come alive
I can take you higher what this is, forgot?
I must now remind you let it rock, let it rock, let it rock

Just let it rock
Let it rock, let it rock, let it rock, let it rock

I'm back like I forgot something, I'm something
Rollin' Rock rubbing rap running
Miles like I'm trying to get a flat stomach
Like Wayne the personal trainer
My aim is perfect I'll fuck ya, period, like the reminder

And I wish I could say, the things you do

Lil Wayne,"And I'm grindin' til I'm attacked
They say ""You ain't grindin' til you tired""
So I'm grindin' with my eyes wide
Looking to find, a way through the day
A light, for the night
Dear Lord, you've done took so many of my people but I'm just wonderin' why
You haven't taken my life?
Like what the hell am I doing right?
My Life

Take me away from the hood like a state penitentiary
Take me away from the hood in the casket or a Bentley
Take me away
Like I overdosed on cocaine
Or take me away like a bullet from Kurt Cobain
Suicide (suicide, suicide)
I'm from a Windy City, like ""Do or Die""
From a block close to where Biggie was crucified
That was Brooklyn's Jesus
Shot for no fuckin' reason
And you wonder why Kanye wears Jesus pieces?
Cause that's Jesus people
And The Game, he's the equal
Hated on so much, ""The Passion of Christ"" need a sequel
Yeah, like Roc-a-fella needed Sigel
Like I needed my father, but he needed a needle
I need some meditation, so I can leave my people
They askin' ""Why?"" Why did John Lennon leave The Beatles?
And why every hood nigga feed off evil?
Answer my question before this bullet leave this Desert Eagle

And I'm grindin' til I'm attacked
They say ""You ain't grindin' til you tired""
So I'm grindin' with my eyes wide

My Life

We are not the same, I am a Martian
So approach my Phantom doors with caution
You see them 24's spinnin' I earned them
And I ain't no preacher but here's my Erick Sermon
So eat this black music and tell me how it taste now
And fuck Jesse Jackson cause it ain't about race now
Sometimes I think about my life, with my face down
Then I see my sons and put on that Kanye smile
Damn, I know his momma proud
And since you helped me sell my +Dream+ we can share my momma now
And like M.J.B.: ""No More Drama"" now
Living the ""Good Life"", me and Common on common ground
I spit crack, and niggas could drive it out of town
Got a Chris Paul mind state, I'm never out of bounds
My life used to be empty like a Glock without a round
Now my life full, like a chopper with a thousand rounds

And I'm grindin' til I'm attacked
They say ""You ain't grindin' til you tired""
So I'm grindin' with my eyes wide
Looking to find, a way through the day
A light, for the night
Dear Lord, you've done took so many of my people but I'm just wonderin' why
You haven't taken my life?
Like what the hell am I doing right?
My Life

Walk through the gates of Hell, see my Impala parked in front
With the high beams on, me and the Devil share chronic blunts
Listening to the ""Chronic"" album, playing backwards
Shootin' at pictures of Don Imus for target practice
My mind fucked up, so I cover it with a Raider hood
I'm from the city that made you motherfuckers afraid of Suge
Made my grandmother pray for good
And never made her happy, when I bet that new Mercedes could
Ain't no bars, but niggas can't escape the hood
They took so many of my niggas, that I should hate the hood
But it's real niggas like me, that make the hood
Ridin' slow in that Phantom just the way I should
With the top back
In my Sox hat
I'm paid in full, the nigga Alpo couldn't stop that
Even if they brought the nigga 'Pac back
I'd still keep this motherfucker cocked back

And I'm grindin' til I'm attacked
They say ""You ain't grindin' til you tired""
So I'm grindin' with my eyes wide
Looking to find, a way through the day
A light, for the night
Dear Lord, you've done took so many of my people but I'm just wonderin' why
You haven't taken my life?

To justify the way you live a lie, live a lie, live a lie
And you take your time and you do your crime
Well you made your bed, I'm in mine

[Chorus]
Because when I arrive
I bring the fire, make you come alive
I can take you higher what this is, forgot?
I must now remind you let it rock, let it rock, let it rock

Now the son's disgraced
He, who knew his father
When he cursed his name
Turned, and chased the dollar
But it broke his heart
So he stuck his middle finger
To the world, to the world to the world
And you take your time and you stand in line
Well you'll get what's yours, I got mine

Yeah! Wayne's world

And the tops and she gonna rock 'til the camera stop

I'm in here up like bitch what's up
Mechanic, me, I can fix you up
I can fuck you up, I can fuck you down
Shorty we can go wherever just pick a town
And the jewelry is louder than an engine sound
Big ass rocks like on the ground
Dirty like socks that's on the ground, Weezy

[Chorus: x2]

Just let it rock
Let it rock, let it rock, let it rock, let it rock

I'm back like I forgot something, I'm something
Rollin' Rock rubbing rap running
Miles like I'm trying to get a flat stomach
Like Wayne the personal trainer
My aim is perfect I'll fuck ya, period, like the reminder

You should be rocking the latest, and purses, bracelets and watches

We go back so far
Swinging in your back yard

We were cool back in high school
Oh I really liked you
Must have been your attitude

That's why you keep on running

True story
Somebody asked me one time
Travie, you high?
You look high
Shit, yeah, I'm high

Let's go

The world is yours, so play the role
Blow the dust off this record and put the needle down slow
Our veins are cold, but we'll never grow old
Let's have a toast, and raise our drinks
No hearts on our sleeves, just eagles on our cuff links
It's such a rush to know you love me so much

We'll do whatever you want to
Girl, I'll make a movie star of you
You know that I could
If you let me be your Hollywood

We'll get high, and hide
We are lovers to the glamorous
White girl so fine
Going up on the downtown line
We'll get high, and hide
We are lovers to the glamorous
White girl so fine
Going up on the downtown line

Take your razor, break down my line
Put your nose to the speaker
Now breathe in, breathe in

Clean up your nose, and face the crowd
Then kiss your mirror 'cause we're all stars now
Isn't it fun how music makes your lips numb?

We'll do whatever you want to
Girl, I'll make a movie star of you
You know that I could
If you let me be your Hollywood

And we never ever act like,
We're too good, we too bougey for the hood life

Living with me in the streets and the show biz

Lil Wayne,"I think we got a problem
Yeah!

Big money in this bitch if you didn't know
Big business minus the business suit
Even I look in the mirror like, ?Is it you??
And I say I must be the hottest if it isn't you

Stay fresh from my top to my tennis shoes
New coupe, no top, big tennis shoes
Never slipping, even on the side of a swimming pool
We don't get ridiculed, we get rid of fools

They said I couldn't play football, I was too small
They say I couldn't play basketball I wasn't tall
They say I couldn't play baseball at all
And now every day of my life I ball

And they say it ain't raining until someone assassinate
And I feel like M.L.K.
Yeah, I have a dream to be your worst nightmare
Now meet the boss of the cartel, Ross!

I'm a seven-nine satan, sitting on Lorenzzes
And I seem really patient, picture the equation
People taking pictures and they really getting flagrant
Flagging down my spaceship, sergeant sniffing for a fragrance

Yayo, yayo, he wanna sniff the yayo
Flying saucer on the hasa in the casa just to lay low
Make more money man that the model for the mob
Need a blowjob my model, get a model for the job

Forty around spending doe, flip ya for my kinfolk
Luxury tax on them packs if you didn't know

Gave me my sack like, good luck getting back
I'm like, ?The fuck I'm going outta there?
And if I'm not careful, be the same place they find him there

And I'm a winner if I make it cross the finish line
Putting food on the table like it's dinner time
And this is what you call sterotyping by far
Can you tell me why your dog keep sniffing my car?

Huh? Got the audacity to call me a liar
?So what you got in your trunk?? ?Oh, just a spare tire?
You niggas talk blow, well I sold mine
Like a bad crampe, it's locking up in no time

More time in the kitchen than I spent in the studio
Gangasta?s paradise and I ain't talking about Coolio
And I can't lie, still addicted to the odor
Got a ice cold Pepsi, still thinking Coke-Cola

While y'all half-assing, nigga my pants sagging
I'm getting money and my swagging black flagging

Million dollar status, fully automatic
Heavy on the innie and even harder on the women
If it wasn't for Reverend, I?d probably be out pimping and shit
Pops, my papi, has already hear me

I tied trapping, shit sent me to prison
Got mad and went to snapping, so homicide came to visit
I smell gun powder, so you got one hour
To come up with every damn dollar or your done dollar

It cost to ball dog
Especially when the players on your team consider you as the ball hog
You treating me like Shaq and you Kobe
But I ain't saying you owe me nigga

Listen...I'ma hundred percent hussla from my face to my feet
My lifetime cases the street, my dime places the street
Until I wake and see another fuckin day is relief
I pray that he keep, I'm scrappin my knees from chasing this cheese
I had point guard dreams of playin for some team
Hit the block and made NBA money in one week
See I hussle in the hood and plus I fly birdies
And play the tracks out every month so I can ride dirty
Needed someone to manage my money I hired Shelly
But Shelly started talkin to much so she died early
They got me loadin up my Benz with my eyes blurry
I sent the message to the fucker at bout five thirty
Now if the bitch ain't got my dice for me then I'm sorry
But I'ma leave everyone who outside bloody
And then I go in the stash get the coke and the cash
I'm lettin niggas score it for half, I'm hopein it last
But still nigga don't, I might have to just go in the lap
And if its slow in the ass back to the rope and the mask

Then observe my work and see that my adversity was worth it,
Verses autobiographical, absolutely classical,
Last thing I'm worried 'bout is what another rapper do,
Ain't nobody hot as me
Even if they rap they ass off
Blast off and have outstanding quality,
Sell a lot of records I respect and salute that,

Like a needle in a hay stack we ain't trying to see the pen
This is a luxury tax

(I don't ask them baby I just tax 'em baby)
(Let's go)

Yeah imagine this,
No imagine that
Gave me my sack like, good luck getting back (Yeah)
I'm like how the fuck I'm gonna get outta there
And if I'm not careful,
Leave 'em the same place they find him there
And I'm a winner if I make it cross the finish line,
Putting food on the table like it's dinner time
And this is what you call stereotyping by far?
Can you tell me me why your dog keep sniffing my car?
Huh? Got the audacity to call me a liar
So what you got in your trunk?
Oh, just a spare tire
You niggas talked blow,
While I sold mine
Like a bad cramp, it's locking up in no time
More time in the kitchen then I spent in the studio,
Gangsters paradise and I ain't talking about Coolio
Can't lie, still addicted to the odor
Got a ice cold Pepsi,
But still thinking Coke-Cola

Ha ha ha

[Chorus]

I'm up early in the morning, and I'm dressed in black
Hold on, every morning I get dressed in black
While your half ass, nigga my pants saggin',
I'm getting money, and my swaggin' and black flaggin'
Million dollar status, fully automatic
Heavy on the henny and even harder on the women
If it wasn't for rappin',
I probably would pimpin' and shit
Pops, my papi, has already hear me
I tried trapping, shit sent me to prison,
Got mad and went to savage so homicide came to visit
I smell gun powder,
So you got one hour to come up with every damn dollar,
Or your dun-dolla
It cost a ball dog,
Especially when the players on your team,
Consider you as the ball hog.
You treat me like Shaq,
And you Kobe but I didn't say you owe me nigga
But act like you know me nigga

Swagger on a hundred thousand, trillion (No one on the corner)
Hey yo I know I got it first
I'm Christopher Columbus, y'all just the pilgrims
Thanksgiving do we even gotta question
Hermes Pastille I pa** the dressing
My attitude is tattooed
That means it's permanent, so I guess we should address it, huh?
My swagger is Mick Jagger
Every time I breathe on the track I asthma attack it
Why he's so mad for, why he gotta have it
'Cause I slaved my whole life, now I'm the master
Na-Na-Na, How it feel to wake up and be the s*** and the urine Na-na-na-na-nal

Can't wear skinny jeans cause my knots don't fit

Gotta pocket like this
So I rock Roc jeans cause my knots so thick
You can learn how to dress just by
Jockin' my fresh
Jockin' jockin' my fresh
Jockin' jocking' my fresh
Follow my steps, it's the road to success
Where the n****s know you thorough
And the girls say yes
But I can't teach you my swag
You can pay for school but you can't buy cla**
School of hard knocks I'm a grad
And that all-blue Yankee is my graduation cap,

I got stripes, Adidas
Mami scream papi no mas!
Run up in your s*** just me no mas
Running this s*** like I got four thighs
None has swagger like this four guys!
When it comes to styles I got several
Sharper than a swagger, dagger all metal
And my jewels, blue and yellow
The type of s*** that make 'em call you Carmelo
Rules as follows stay true to the ghetto
Write your name on the bullet make you feel special, ha
What the f*** you boys talking about?

That's right,
You know see Weezy for the wordplay,
Jeezy for the bird-play,
Kanyeezy for diversity and me for controversy,
All my verses picture perfect all is meant to serve a purpose, 
You ain't living what you kicking then you worthless,
Looking from the surface it may seem that I got reason to be nervous 
Then observe my work and see that my adversity was worth it,
Verses autobiographical, absolutely cla**ical,
Last thing I'm worried 'bout is what another rapper do,
Ain't nobody hot as me 
Even if they rap they a** off 
Blast off and have outstanding quality,
Sell a lot of records I respect and salute that,
But spitting real life on hot beats I'm the truth at
You kick it like me no exaggeration necessary,
Living revolutionary, nothing less than legendary,
Gangsta s*** hereditary, got it from my dad
Flow colder than February with extraordinary swag

So I'm not racing I'm just sprintin'
Cause I don't wanna' finish
They diminish, I replenish

If I hop out, that be suicide
No back seats, call that paralyze
I don't have a spine, I don't fantasize
I mastermind, then go after mine
You see I handle mine, I dismantle mine
I told her tool box ""B**** it's Hammer-time""
So excuse me as I nail em' to something
Just repeal em', I'm a kill em'
Someone tell em', I'm a kill em'

Tank never empty
Damn everybody in the bank act friendly
Used to think my s*** didn't stink boy was I wrong
Approving million dollar deals from my iPhone
I'm a take it one two way back
Like a silk wife beater 
And a wave cap or the wave pool at blue bayou
And I waved fool as I blew by you
Hello, hi you,

Feed you to Pyru

Gotta 3-80 on my waist and Rambo at home
No more bandanna round my dome bandanna in my right pocket
B**** I'm grown f*** what you on
Now watch me stand on the world as I sit in a throne
And if I jump I'm a fly and look into the eagles eye
And see I am nothin' like you, why?
B**** see, it gets me how nothing gets me or get to me
And if you shootin' for the star than just shoot me
But your bullets don't reach mars
Pause, clause, because I'm a a beast I'm a dog ill get'cha
My picture should be in the dictionary
Next to the definition of definition
Because repetition is the father of learnin'
And son I know your barrel burnin' but

Please don't shoot me down cause I'm flyin' I'm flyin'
I'm high-up
Please don't me down cause I'm flyin' I'm high up
(This tea is at a real good temperature right now, so am I)

Pappa I did it to em, I'm a bastard
And I'm a do it again like n**** backwards
These n****s backwards but they behind us
Now watch me get high like times up
Now D bring the drums back
And watch me hit em' where there lungs sat like that
I get respect cause if I don't I'm a take it
I see your boys hatin' and I see your girls naked
Drum sound like a naked gun switch clips with my thumb
Then I pop another clip in and aim at his vision
Cause Wayne is his vision cause Wayne is the mission
I'm aimin' at a mirror

Please don't shoot me down cause I'm flyin' im flyin'
(And I've done it before, please don't make me do it no more)
I'm high-up
Please don't me down cause I'm flyin' I'm high up

Lil Wayne,"Baby you understand me now
If sometimes you see that I'm mad
Don't you know no one alive can always be an angel
When everything goes wrong, you see some bad
But I'm just a soul whose intentions are good
Oh lord please don't let me be misunderstood

What's understood ain't gotta be explained
But you don't understand me so let me explain
Stood in the heat, the flames, the snow
Please slow down hurricane
The wind blow, my dreads swing
He had hair like wool, like Wayne
Dropping ashes in the bible
I shake em out and they fall on the rifle
Scary, Hail Mary no tale fairy
All real very, extraordinary
Perry mason facing, the barrel if he tattle
My God is my judge, no gown no gavel
I'm a rebel, down to battle
Now or never, I would never and ever
Fucking fantastic, fuck if you agree, I'm bright
But I don't give a fuck if you see me

[Chorus]
I'm just a soul whose intentions are good
Oh Lord please don't let me be misunderstood

What's understood ain't gotta be explained
So for those who understand meet Dwayne
For eight and a half months I gave Ms. Cita pain
Now it's young money baby, keep the change
My mama say fuck em and we the same
So hello mothafucka' you got some sheets to change
And ain't it funny how people change like Easter Sunday
You know church fit then outfit,
Bright pink and green chest look house lit
Bright pinky rings but that ain't about this
What you bout bitch
Excuse my French emotion in my passion
But I wear my heart on my sleeve like it's the new fashion
What are you asking, if I don't have the answer
It's probably on the web, like I'm a damn tarantula
But I know you don't understand, 
Cause you thought Lil Wayne was Weezy
But Weezy is Dwayne

[Chorus]

I was watching t.v. the other day right
Got this white guy on there 
Talking about black guys
Talking about how young black guys are targeted
Targeted by who? America
You see one in every hundred Americans are locked up
One in every nine black Americans are locked up
And see what the white guy was trying to stress was that
The money we spend on sending a mothafucka' to jail
A young mothafucka' to jail
Would be less to send his or her young ass to college
See, and another thing the white guy was stressing was that
Our jails are populated with drug dealers, 
You know crack cocaine yea stuff like that
Meaning due to the laws we have on crack cocaine and regular cocaine
Police are only, I don't want to say only right, but shit
Only logic by riding around in the hood all day
And not in the suburbs
Because crack cocaine is mostly found in the hood
And you know the other thing is mostly found in you know where I'm going
But why bring a mothafucka' to jail if it's not gon' stand up in court
Cause this drug ain't that drug, 
You know level three, level four drug, shit like that
I guess it's all a misunderstanding
I sit back and think, you know us young mothafuckas you know that 1 in 9
We probably only selling the crack cocaine because we in the hood
And it's not like in the suburbs, we don't have what you have
Why? I really don't wanna know the answer
I guess we just misunderstood huh
You know we don't have room in the jail now for the real mothafuckas, 
The real criminals
Sex offenders, rapists serial killers
Don't get scared, don't get scared
I know you saw one them sex offenders papers
Don't trip he live right on the end of yo block,
Mhm yea, that nigga live right down the street from you,
Sex offender on the level three drug,
Convicted ex-con
Yea check em out
Watch you got, you got a daughter, son, what you got?
Ha ha yea, you know what
That's the good weed,
You know what, I have a fucking daughter
You understand me and why the fuck would you bring my neighbor to jail
Just because the reason why he live next door to me, 
Ain't the reason I live next door to him
Meaning he didn't rap his way to my fucking neighborhood
He sold crack cocaine to get to my neighborhood
You move him out bring him to jail for life
And then you move in with a sex offender
Ha ha, hey give me a paper,
Ha ha is that a misunderstanding because I didn't understand it
Another thing, let me take my glasses off
Cause I wanna see the reaction on there faces when I say this
Ha ha, this is why I don't respect you and nobody like ya
See you're the type that gets off on getting on other people
That's not good
No homo,
Rather un-human, I should say
I mean giving the fact that humanity were a good humanity
Rather to me is helping one another
No matter your color or race
But this guy and people like him, 
They'd rather speculate before they informate
If that's a word, ha ha ha you know spec before check
Anyways meaning id much rather
You talk to me first and see if you can lend an opinion before you link one
Just my thought of good humanity 
Mr. Sharpton, hold on I ain't finished with you man
Na fuck that shit Mhm hold on, um,
Mr. sharp ton and anyone like you, you don't know me
So if your not going to try to then what you say or think about me
Are what ever I do is totally Casper the friendly ghost
To me and it doesn't make you a good person 
To criticize before you improvise
Doesn't necessarily make you a bad person either 
But the characteristics for heavenly into bads way, 
Haha but since I am human I am good and bad, 
As well but I try my hardest to stay good
Threes other things I do and say may be bad or just not to good
But I do try, so with that said I don't vote you, 
I mean your only human, good or bad
But I also don't respect you and I don't care if that's good or bad
You see you are no MLK you are no Jesse Jackson, 
You are nobody, to me, your just another don king, 
With a perm, haha just a little more political, 
And that just means you're a little un-human
Then use humans, and now let me be human and say, 
Fuck Al Sharpton and anyone like him
Fuck if you understand me
I love being misunderstood
Ha ha why?,
Cause I live in the suburbs
But I come from the hood
Bring the hook in.

Lil Wayne,"We are at war
With the universe
The sky is falling
And the only thing that can save us now
Is sensitivity and compassion

But I know one thing's for sure
I'm gonna get my kicks before it all burns down

Some say tragedy is hard to get over
But some time that tragedy means its over, soldier
From the academy, league of rollers
I deny being down though they seem to hold us
My shoulders are strong, I prove them wrong
I ain't doing nothin' but movin' on, let the truth be known
But they talk that freedom matters, and didn't even leave a ladder, damn

I work at the corner store
We all got problems problems
Who was gon' fight alone
No one's gon' save us now
How you feel, you're not alone
We're all just jealous jealous
We don't reach the sky no more
We just can't overcome no

Tie my hands
What am I gonna be
What have I done so bad
What is my destiny
Tie my hands
What am I supposed to see
What have I done so bad
What am I gonna be

I, knock on the door, hope isn't home,
Fates not around, the lucks all gone
Don't ask me whats wrong, ask me whats right
And I'm a tell you whats life
And did you know?
I lost everything, but I ain't the only one
First came the hurricane, then the morning sun
Excuse me if I'm on one, and don't trip if I light one,
I walk a tight one
They try to tell me keep my eyes open
My whole city under water, some people still floatin'
Then they wonder why black people still voting,
Cause your presidents still chokin'
Take away the football team, the basketball team
Now all we got is me to represent New Orleans
No governor, no help from the mayor
Just a steady beatin' heart, and a wish and a prayer

These friends they come and go
But I got family family
These kids so fast they grow
They learn so quickly now
That there's no way to go,
That there's no future future
Don't make this seem so low
That we can't overcome

Tie my hands
What am I gonna be
What have I done so bad
What is my destiny
Tie my hands
What am I supposed to see
What have I done so bad
What am I gonna be

And if you come from under the water then there's fresh air
Just breathe baby, gods got a blessing to spare
Yes, I know the process has so much stress
But its the progress that fills the best
'Cause I came from the projects straight to success
And your next, so try they can't steal your pride its inside
Then find it and keep on grinding
'Cause in every dark cloud there's a silver lining
I know

Right now we just riding on love
A shot in the dark,
We ain't tryna do nothing be at the heart
We need love, that's all now

You tie my hands, what am I gonna be
What have I done so bad, what is my destiny
You tie my hands, what am I going to see
What have I done so bad, what am I gonna be",Tie My Hands,2008

Lil Wayne,"Baby you understand me now
If sometimes you see that I'm mad
Don't you know no one alive can always be an angel
When everything goes wrong, you see some bad
But I'm just a soul whose intentions are good
Oh lord please don't let me be misunderstood

What's understood ain't gotta be explained
But you don't understand me so let me explain
Stood in the heat, the flames, the snow
Please slow down hurricane
The wind blow, my dreads swing
He had hair like wool, like Wayne
Dropping ashes in the bible
I shake em out and they fall on the rifle
Scary, Hail Mary no tale fairy
All real very, extraordinary
Perry mason facing, the barrel if he tattle
My God is my judge, no gown no gavel
I'm a rebel, down to battle
Now or never, I would never and ever
F***ing fantastic, f*** if you agree, I'm bright
But I don't give a f*** if you see me

[Chorus]
I'm just a soul whose intentions are good
Oh Lord please don't let me be misunderstood

What's understood ain't gotta be explained
So for those who understand meet Dwayne
For eight and a half months I gave Ms. Cita pain
Now it's young money baby, keep the change
My mama say f*** em and we the same
So hello mothaf***a' you got some sheets to change
And ain't it funny how people change like Easter Sunday
You know church fit then outfit,
Bright pink and green chest look house lit
Bright pinky rings but that ain't about this
What you bout b****
Excuse my French emotion in my passion
But I wear my heart on my sleeve like it's the new fashion
What are you asking, if I don't have the answer
It's probably on the web, like I'm a damn tarantula
But I know you don't understand, 
Cause you thought Lil Wayne was Weezy
But Weezy is Dwayne

[Chorus]

I was watching t.v. the other day right
Got this white guy on there 
Talking about black guys
Talking about how young black guys are targeted
Targeted by who? America
You see one in every hundred Americans are locked up
One in every nine black Americans are locked up
And see what the white guy was trying to stress was that
The money we spend on sending a mothaf***a' to jail
A young mothaf***a' to jail
Would be less to send his or her young a** to college
See, and another thing the white guy was stressing was that
Our jails are populated with drug dealers, 
You know crack cocaine stuff like that
Meaning due to the laws we have on crack cocaine and regular cocaine
Police are only, I don't want to say only right, but s***
Only logic by riding around in the hood all day
And not in the suburbs
Because crack cocaine is mostly found in the hood
And you know the other thing is mostly found in you know where I'm going
But why bring a mothaf***a' to jail if it's not gon' stand up in court
Cause this drug ain't that drug, 
You know level 3, level 4 drug, s*** like that
I guess it's all a misunderstanding
I sit back and think, you know us young mothaf***as you know that 1 in 9
We probably only selling the crack cocaine because we in the hood
And it's not like in the suburbs, we don't have what you have
Why? I really don't wanna know the answer
I guess we just misunderstood huh
You know we don't have room in the jail now for the real mothaf***as, 
The real criminals
Sex offenders, rapists serial killers
Don't get scared, don't get scared
I know you saw one them sex offenders papers
Don't trip he live right on the end of yo block,
Mhm yea, that n**** live right down the street from you,
Sex offender on the level three drug,
Convicted ex-con
Yea check em out
Watch you got, you got a daughter, son, what you got?
Ha ha yea, you know what
That's the good weed,
You know what, I have a f***ing daughter
You understand me and why the f*** would you bring my neighbor to jail
Just because the reason why he live next door to me, 
Ain't the reason I live next door to him
Meaning he didn't rap his way to my f***ing neighborhood
He sold crack cocaine to get to my neighborhood
You move him out bring him to jail for life
And then you move in with a sex offender
Ha ha, hey give me a paper,
Ha ha is that a misunderstanding because I didn't understand it
Another thing, let me take my glasses off
Cause I wanna see the reaction on there faces when I say this
Ha ha, this is why I don't respect you and nobody like ya
See you're the type that gets off on getting on other people
That's not good

Rather un-human, I should say
I mean giving the fact that humanity were a good humanity

No matter your color or race
But this guy and people like him, 
They'd rather speculate before they informate
If that's a word, ha ha ha you know spec before check
Anyways meaning id much rather
You talk to me first and see if you can lend an opinion before you link one
Just my thought of good humanity 
Mr. Sharpton, hold on I ain't finished with you man
Na f*** that s*** hm hold on, um,
Mr. sharp ton and anyone like you, you don't know me
So if your not going to try to then what you say or think about me
Are what ever I do is totally Casper the friendly ghost
To me and it doesn't make you a good person 
To criticize before you improvise
Doesn't necessarily make you a bad person either 
But the characteristics for heavenly into bads way, 
Ha ha but since I am human I am good and bad, 
As well but I try my hardest to stay good
Threes other things I do and say may be bad or just not to good
But I do try, so with that said I don't vote you, 
I mean your only human, good or bad
But I also don't respect you and I don't care if that's good or bad
You see you are no M-L-K you are no Jesse Jackson, 
You are nobody, to me, your just another don king, 
With a perm, ha ha just a little more political, 
And that just means you're a little un-human
Then use humans, and now let me be human and say, 
F*** Al Sharpton and anyone like him
F*** if you understand me
I love being misunderstood
Ha ha why?,
Cause I live in the suburbs
But I come from the hood
Bring the hook in.

But yesterday It Seemed to just wander on till it found me,
The gossip found me
Then why don't you just prove it
How? You don't know how to prove it?,
Well, what you just do is

Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop (Oh)
Stop, hatin' on a n****
That is a weak emotion
The lady of a n****
And you could get tipped
Like ya waitin' on a n****, and
Put a body bag and an apron on tha n****

I give my all behind the mic,
But you could never see, if you sit behind the light
You don't have to pick me, to win the title fight
But I'm gone wear that championship belt so tight
And if I'm wrong, there is no right
And if I'm wrong, there is no white
I'm tryna be polite, 
But you b****es in my hair like the f***ing Po-lice
My flow is rare, these other rappers nice,
These other rappers bark,
Some of em' even bite
But I'm much more bright
I give the game sight
So before you dim the light you just might, might, wanna

Think it over (think it over) Baby

Fear God, not them
Steer my Robin Coupe through the streets of the booth and
Soo-woop
And, then I leave a tub in the boot, I leave a blood bath,
Sorry there's a tub in the boot, now where the drugs at?
Like the string of the shoe
No n**** f*** that
I'm twisted like the string on a boot, where New Orleans at?
I build hip hop solely like a bus pa**
So in your possession, I must ask

Hey, haven't I been good to you? (Think it over)
Tell me, haven't I been sweet to you?

Drag my name through the mud
I come out clean
Cast away stones
I won't even blink
A gun is not a math problem,
I won't even think
Just leave you dead like the meat under my sink
Don't believe in me
Don't believe me
I graduated from hungry,
And made it to greedy
My flow is like pasta
Take it and eat it
But I'm gone need cheese if I'm bakin' a ziti
You n****s want beef?
I want a steak and uh, we be
Lost in Amsterdam or Jamaica where we be
Hard body n****, takin' it easy

Oh shit, yo, yo, run!

Aiyo, I jumped from the 8th floor step, hit the ground
The pound fell, cops is coming
Runnin' through the pissy stairwells, I ain't hear nothin'
Buggin', only thing I remember was the bullshit summon
So I stopped at the 2nd floor, ran across, cracks is fallin'
My pockets is lean, clean when I vanished off
Took off, made track look easy
The walkie talkies them D-E-T's had, black, they was rated P.G.
Run, I will not give up, no, quick flag the car down
Take me to, Ghost here they come now!
Er! Pull off quick, back up, hit the bitch, dog
Turned down Hill, light the Marley spliff
Run! I will not get bagged on the rock
Run! I seen what happened to Un, they bad with they cops
Run! They am' shit, plan shit, destroy evidence
Fuck a case, I'm not comin' home when I'm fifty six
Die with the heart of Scarface and take fifty licks
Before I let these crackers throw me and shit
Bounce if you a good kid, bounce, do the bird hop
Curse, swerve to get served, these cocksuckers got nerve
Heard I was killin' shit, they must got word
That I told the chief on Rich Port I don't wanna merge

I skated through the back of the building, hit the steps up
Ran up in Kay crib, lay daddy rest
I had to break free, police on me and they F-B's
Yelling ""I think his name Lex, that's his aunt, freeze""
That's when I hit the window, indo' coming out the back room
Boom, Pretty and his man, Black Caesar
Damn, they saw me and they bustin' at me
Cab just missed me, plus them goochie frames, foul, that's six fifty
Stop back at suite, them leaf defense slid through my man garden
Yelled out 'pardon', kept it moving, peace
Build be gone, ain't no honor amongst thieves
Please, plus they heard I'm getting Parmesan cheese
And I won't stop moving til the metal dig me
Say word, yo, make 'em work for it, young rookie, y'all need me
That's when it is, what it is, if it's that or the cup
But in the ill gangstas book what they niggas do is

[Chorus]
Run! If you sell drugs in the school zone
Run! If you gettin' chased with no shoes on
Run! Fuck that! Run! Cops got, guns!
They givin' out life like by the tons
Run! If you ain't do shit, you it
That next felony, nigga, it's like three zip
So, run! Hop fences, jump over benches!
When you see me comin' get the fuck out the entrance!
Run! Fuck that! Run! Cops got guns!

Ah-hah! I might gotta take my shirt off (yeah, kid)
I like that one (uh-huh, go in, go in!)

Yo, uh, it's Task Force Tuesday, the NARCS is in the black car
I got five hundred, hundred packs in my backyard
Clear twelve-twelve's, that look like stuff shells
I'm cuttin' niggas throats on the sails, while they puff L's
Don't leave nothin' unbagged, shave everything
I learned from the O.G.'s to save everything (to save everything)
They come by one more time, they gon' hop out
They two deep, and one is a bitch, she gettin' knocked out
Then I can get rid of the pack
But I just copped this pretty chrome thing, so I'm dippin' with that
Uh, down-shiftin' on 'em like I got gears on me
(Run!) Besides that, I got about 5 years on me
(Run!) Scared to death, runnin' like I got bears on me
(Run!) My Timb's start feelin' like they Nike Air's on me
(Run!) It's hard for me to slow down, it's like I'm on the throughway
My belt's in the crib on the floor by my two-way
Now I'm try'nna hold my hammer up, and my pants too
If they don't kill me, they gon' give me a number I can't do
Rather it be the streets, then jail where I die at
And I'm asthmatic, so I'm lookin' for somewhere to hide at
But they too close, and I got this new toast
'Magine if I would of let off a shot or two, you know what I gotta do

Free hold east coast whole, boxing the Philly down
Down to Dela', when y'all rarely toting the milli round
I bring the milli to ya house, I was just down south
Carolina had the milli down there
Pearl Beach had the heater in reach, and four freaks
In Hooters, I made 'em lose it when they heard freedom of speech
Told them freaks that I gotta run, I'm on the run
But they tried to make me stay, they showed me two hooters a piece
I stayed for a second but you know I gotta skate
It's like a race, cops chase me, I'm chasing the moon
Before I left the premise, saw two more bitches
They told me they was witches, told me hop on they broom
I did, and then we went zoom
Don't you know them witches got me outtie wit the quickness
I'm buggin', I'm trippin' in reality I'm skitzin'
The cops got me trapped in the Audi wit the Smith and

[Chorus]

D-Boy, yeah, Birdman Jr. in ya building, people
I'm a let you know how it go on my side of the mountain, whoadie

It's sure about does that you heard me
And I dropped in effect since 9/11
I'm on the avenue with nines, elevens, I'm a two times felon
That's why I keep the top up, on my 9-11
Pele, in New Orleans, ain't got no Rico law
So I keep that heat in the car, but they don't know
I had that 'dro in the seat of the car
But it's hot right now, so you can see me tomorrow
Ay, Ghostface, the youngins on the block duckin' blue and red lights
While your boy bypassing fare light
But if them cock suckers ever get me dead right
Three hots and the cops swallow weed and a knife, right?
I speed at night, take it easy in the day
Go hard wit the dough, take it easy wit the yae
Yup, Lil' Weezy, I get my loot up
But at the pull up, come, I say my crew run run, boy

Good morning doctor carter (hey sweetie)
Looks like its going to be a long day. (another one what we got?)
Your first patient (yeah)
Is suffering from a lack of concept (uh-huh)
Originality (ugh)
His flow is weak (another one)
And he has no style (ugh)
What'cha got for um?

OK, let me put my gloves on and my scrubs on.
Dr.carter to the rescue.
Excuse me if I'm late,
But like a thief it takes time to be this great
Ha! so just wait, your style is a disgrace,
Your rhymes are fifth place and I'm just grace.
One, uno, ace and I'm tryin' to make your heart beat like bass,
But your sweet like cake and I come to fix
Whatever you shall break.
Where is your originality?
You are so fake so picture me like a gallery.
Capture what I say.
All I need is one mic.
All I need is one take.
Like hey, brighter then the sun ray got a pistols on the playground.
Watch the gun-play like.
No kidding, no kids in the way,
But the kids do watch.
Gotta watch what we say.
Gotta work everyday.
Gotta not be cliche.
Gotta stand out like Andre 3k.
Gotta kick it kick it like the sensei.
You gotta have faith you gotta gotta wait wait
Think I think I lost 'em

Good afternoon doctor carter
Nurse
I don't know about this one
His confidence is down
Vocab and metaphors needs work
And he lost respect for the game
Ah let me see
Think you can save him?

OK.
Respect is in the heart.
So that's where I'm a start.
And a lot of heart patients don't make it.
Now hey kid
Plural I graduated
Cause you could get through anything if magic made it.
And that was called recycling
Or re-reciting
Something cause you just like it
So you say it just like it.
Some say its biting
But I say its enlightening
Besides, Dr. Kanye West is one of the brightest.
And Dr. Swizz can stitch your track up the tightest.
And Dr. Jeezy can fix your back up the nicest.
Arthritis in my hand from writing.
But I'm a doctor they don't understand my writing.
So I stop writing.
Now I'm like lighting.
And you ain't Vince Young so don't clash with the titans.
Fast and exciting.
My passion is frighting.
Now let me put some more vocab in your i.v.
Here take this Vicodin
Like it and love it
And confidence has no budget
So pay me no mind
I don't walk like I talk it cause I'm running
I don't do it cause I done it and I'm in the emergency unit
God damn it I've lost another one

Good evening doctor carter its been a long day
But this one looks much better then the others
His respect is back up
Concepts sound good his style is showing strong signs of improvement
All he needs now is some swagger
OK let me take my gloves off then

Swagger tighter then a yeast infection.
Fly go hard like geese erection.
Fashion patrol police detection.
I stay tight like Chinese connection.
I stay tight like pussy at night.
Baby don't get me wrong I could do that pussy right.
But I'm too wrong to write.
Too fresh to fight.
Too paid to freestyle.
Too paid to freestyle.
I had to say it twice
Swagger so nice.
And don't ask me shit unless it concern a price.
And I don't rap fast I rap slow.
Cause I mean every letter in the words in the sentence of my quotes.
Swagger just flow sweeter then honey oats.
That swagger I got it I wear it like a coat.
Wait, as I put the light down his throat.
I can only see flow.
His blood starting to flow.
His lungs starting to grow.
This one starting to show.
Strong signs of life.
Wheres the stitches here's the knife.
Smack his face his eyes open I reply what a night.
Welcome back hip hop I saved your life.

He looks good
His vitals are up
He's looking good
He's looking good
I think we got one
Doctor carter I think we got one
Yup we got one
We saved him
He's good
He's good
We got one
He's good
He's good
We got 'em
He's a go
He's good",Dr. Carter [Acapella],2008

And he has no style (ugh)
What'cha got for um?

OK, let me put my gloves on and my scrubs on.
Dr.carter to the rescue. 
Excuse me if I'm late,
But like a thief it takes time to be this great
Ha! so just wait, your style is a disgrace,
Your rhymes are fifth place and I'm just grace.
One, uno, ace and I'm tryin' to make your heart beat like bass,
But your sweet like cake and I come to fix
Whatever you shall break. 
Where is your originality?
You are so fake so picture me like a gallery.
Capture what I say. 
All I need is one mic. 
All I need is one take.
Like hey, brighter then the sun ray got a pistols on the playground.
Watch the gun-play like.
No kidding, no kids in the way,
But the kids do watch. 
Gotta watch what we say. 
Gotta work everyday.
Gotta not be cliche.
Gotta stand out like Andre 3k.
Gotta kick it kick it like the sensei.
You gotta have faith you gotta gotta wait wait
Think I think I lost 'em

Good afternoon doctor carter
Nurse
I don't know about this one 
His confidence is down 
Vocab and metaphors needs work 
And he lost respect for the game
Ah let me see
Think you can save him?

OK.
Respect is in the heart.
So that's where I'm a start.
And a lot of heart patients don't make it.
Now hey kid
Plural I graduated
Cause you could get through anything if magic made it.
And that was called recycling
Or re-reciting
Something cause you just like it
So you say it just like it.
Some say its biting
But I say its enlightening
Besides, Dr. Kanye West is one of the brightest.
And Dr. Swizz can stitch your track up the tightest.
And Dr. Jeezy can fix your back up the nicest.
Arthritis in my hand from writing.
But I'm a doctor they don't understand my writing.
So I stop writing.
Now I'm like lighting.
And you ain't Vince Young so don't clash with the titans.
Fast and exciting.
My passion is frighting.
Now let me put some more vocab in your i.v.
Here take this Vicodin
Like it and love it
And confidence has no budget 
So pay me no mind 
I don't walk like I talk it cause I'm running 
I don't do it cause I done it and I'm in the emergency unit
God damn it I've lost another one

Good evening doctor carter its been a long day 
But this one looks much better then the others 
His respect is back up 
Concepts sound good his style is showing strong signs of improvement 
All he needs now is some swagger
OK let me take my gloves off then

Swagger tighter then a yeast infection.
Fly go hard like geese erection.
Fashion patrol police detection.
I stay tight like Chinese connection.
I stay tight like p**** at night.
Baby don't get me wrong I could do that p**** right.
But I'm too wrong to write.
Too fresh to fight.
Too paid to freestyle.
Too paid to freestyle.
I had to say it twice
Swagger so nice.
And don't ask me s*** unless it concern a price.
And I don't rap fast I rap slow.
Cause I mean every letter in the words in the sentence of my quotes.
Swagger just flow sweeter then honey oats.
That swagger I got it I wear it like a coat.
Wait, as I put the light down his throat.
I can only see flow.
His blood starting to flow.
His lungs starting to grow.
This one starting to show.
Strong signs of life.
Wheres the stitches here's the knife.
Smack his face his eyes open I reply what a night.
Welcome back hip hop I saved your life.

He looks good
His vitals are up
He's looking good
He's looking good
I think we got one
Doctor carter I think we got one
Yup we got one
We saved him 
He's good
He's good
We got one
He's good
He's good 
We got 'em
He's a go

So good you can smell it through the roof,
If you getting money throw your hood out the roof,
You know it ain't a remix without the band man,
Fliest nigga in the club he got on his man bands
Why he call bag man because he got them bands
Would have called him gram bands if he had them grams in em,
Leave nothing at the crib I got it all on,
And I ain't leave nothing off I got it all on,
So I ain't trying to be rude, niggas ain't shit,
They just trying to be dude, niggas ain't this,
Pull up in something so stupid, like what ya think?
Damn shades so dark I can't even blink,
Left the street with bad habits I can't spill my drink,
Fuck around and have a flashback, I might need a sink,
I get it in I go hard, that's my own broad,
Fuck critics, straight cash that's my gold card,
Always black, I'm in black always,
Always strapped, yeah I'm strapped always.",Always Strapped [Remix],2009
Lil Wayne,"I want to be the best
I want to be the best that ever played
That's why I play the game
And to be the best you have to win
That's what drives me

He's the best player in the game
It's just that simple
There's nothing that Kobe Bryant can't do
He will defend your best player
He will shoot from the perimeter
He will get all in yo mug
He will do whatever it takes
He is the most complete basketball player
In the game today - bar none
He has an assassins mentality
I said this week, I said this when the trade went down
And I will repeat it again
Who's starving more for an NBA World Championship
More than Kobe Bryant? There is no one
This guy is highly motivated
What separates Kobe from the pack?
More than Kobe Bryant, there is no one

Okay
Kobe doin' work
Two four on my shirt
He the greatest on the court
And I'm the greatest on the verse
Going for the 4th ring like it was his first
Gotta get the bling
Do it for Kareem!
24 (two-four) so nice, my flow so mean
Catch me at the game sitting next to Goldestein
Kobe Bryant Nikes, purple gold strings,
Kobe in the game dunking on your team
Black Mamba, attack conquer
Basketball beast, rap monster
Crossover good, a turnaround jumper
Or just drive in the lane and dunk on dunkers
You know where it's going, it's going down yo
This is the Lakeshow, but don't drown though
I call him King Bryant, now let the crown show

I'm definitely, I'm just lost for words
I mean, he's amazing

Pass me the damn ball
I don't need a pick at all
And don't worry bout my shot
'Cause I'ma get that off
Yea, I drops 40 on your double team
Then I drop 81 on another team
Yeah, you better guard me with caution
And watch I work em like an auction
No such thing as exhaustion
No time for resting
'Cause I don't take breaks
I just break records
And I prefer the ball with three seconds
And I bet we gone win it all in three seconds
Ya dig? That is a guarantee
Apparently
And please tell your defense
Don't ever man to man with me
Double team, triple team
Your defenders sick of me
But, I never let em get to me
Literally
Step back and give em a three
Ain't no defending me

One guy certainly envious of the way Bryant's playing lately
LeBron James

I've been recorded saying that
He's definitely the best player in our League
Um, to me, in my eyes
The best scorer in our League
And there's not another guy in our League
That can accomplish some of the things
That he's doing

Never take a day off
Catch you at the top of the key
And get a J off
Baseline face time
Tongue out like two-three
Two-three gotta love how I do me
Practice while you sleep
Practice in my sleep
Straight outta high school
Tha' brackets ain't for me
I will be jumping over you
Like I got a mattress at my feet
And all the Phil Jackson teams
Better be passing it to me
I put the master in the beast
Attack you like a beast
I am starving for victory
And that means ima eat
And when they ask you who's the best
Then the answer should be me

Who's the best player in the NBA?
Um, I'll say Kobe Bryant.
Really? Why?
Because you never know what you're gonna get

Call me Mr. Clutch or Mr. automatic
I can post em up, or Lamar go get the ally
I'm going for the ring
I'm going for the ring
I went to Beijing
And came back with the bling
Who they want?
They want Kobe
And what he want?
He want the trophy
The victory
And the glory
No Shaq
No Robert Horry
Now break em off, Kobe break em off
You better be where that Laker don't
Yea, just give him the ball and he take it off
Or he properly dishing it to Gasol
Or give it to D-Fish on the wing, yeah
Or just let lil' Ariza do his thing, yeah
'Cause I'm great, and so is my team, yeah

(I thought you want to be the greatest)

Do it for Magic
It's your time baby
I see nothing wrong with doing it four times baby
I'm the best yes
And he the best yeah
Don't worry LeBron, get 'em next year
Now what's defense
To an assassin
Killer instinct

Labels want my name beside the X like Malcolm
Everybody got a deal, I did it without one

I had raped the game young
You can call it statutory
When a nigga blow up they can build statures of me

You would think these niggas would know me when they really doesn't
Like they was down with the old me no you fucking wasn't
You're such a fucking loser
He didn't even go to class Bueller
Trade the Grammy plaques just to have my granny back
Remember she had that bad hip like a fanny pack
Chasing that stardom would turn you into a maniac

I want this shit forever wake up and smell the Garden
Fresher than the harvest
Step up to the target
If I had one guess than I guess I'm just New Orleans
And I will never stop like I'm running from the cops
Hopped up in my car and told my chauffeur to the top
Life is such a fucking roller coaster then it drops
But what should I scream for this is my theme park
My minds shine even when my thoughts seem dark
Pistol on my side you don't wanna hear that thing talk
Let the king talk check the price and pay attention

As Shady spits his flow
Nuts they go, macadamian they go so ballistic wow
We can make them look like bozos
He's wondering if he should spit this slow
Fuck no go for broke
His cup just runneth over oh no
He ain't had a buzz like this since the last time he overdosed
They've been waiting patiently for Pinocchio to poke his nose
Back into the game and they know
Rap will never be the same as before
Bashing in the brains of these hoes
And establishing a name as he goes
The passion and the flame is ignited
You can't put it out once we light it
This shit is exactly what the fuck I'm talking about when we riot
You dealin' with a few true villains
Whose staying inside of the booth truth spillin'
And spit true feelings
Til our tooth fillings come flying up out of our mouths, now rewind it
Payback muthafucka for the way you got at me so hows it taste?
When I slap the taste out your mouth
With the bass so loud that it shakes the place
I'm Hannibal Lecter so just in case you're thinking of saving face
You ain't gonna have no face to save

Then you better switch the topic
Bitch nigga stop it
Gon' ahead and cop it
Money in the bag
Probably takin' out the garbage
I know them boys snitchin'
Cause they're scared of 1st degree
But you can tell em f.e.d's
I'm in VIP
With 4 mill chedda' keep boy keys
The window to the wall
Supplier of what you need

Got no wife but the wife be my girlfriend
My girlfriend girlfriend
Lookin' for a girl friend
Nick name tail spin
Meet you in da whirlwind
Lord hear the way
Now they ask you where the world went

[Chorus]

I'm so fly
Not to mention that I'm priceless
Ya ain't never seen
Heard of them
None like this
Thousand dollar jeans
Air force 2 Nike's
Prowlin' in the club
Give a fuck about indictments
You can bartender but the drinks on me
2 magnums in my hand
One fo' creeps one fo' freaks
Too much legal tender
So its raining bubbly
My ice the same color
How Kelis used to be

Hold up wait a minute
Pop pop niggas ain't even they spinnin'
I made a make dollars
So it have to make sense
I'm born out liquor
I'ma dead president
All long day
All long die
Toe tag money see it fallin' out the sky
Bitch if I'm priceless
Then bury me alive
My pockets like caskets
Death live inside

[Chorus]

Alligator wit the sways
50 on the carpet
All yellow hard 8s
Scarface white leather
Purple cush
Green all red shinin' any weather
Customized jeeps for high priced life nigga
Get it till you cant no mo
Shop till you cant no mo
10 on some new shoes
50 on the boy
100 on some new jeans
And give a fuck bout the price
Precious little tight blue heart on my mike
She'll get your whole life for a stack
Get yourself something nice

Lil Wayne,"I loved her fancy underwear
I sit behind her every year
Waiting for the chance to get
To tell her I'm the one she should be with
She's popular with all the guys
So innocent in my eye
I could see her in my life
She would've had the perfect sweet man
But
See she had other plans
I could not understand
Her and her stupid friends
Varsity's biggest fans

Never forget the day
She laughed and walked away
And I couldn't stop her
I guess she had it all
She had it all figured out
But she left me with a broken heart
Fucked around and turned me down
Cause she didn't think I could play the part
But now the prom queen the prom queen
Is crying sittin' outside of my door
See you never know how
How everything could turn around

They loved her fancy underwear
Every boyfriend every year
She tried to keep 'em entertained
When they can hardly remember her name
She did everything she could just to
To make him love and treat her good
She found herself alone
Askin' herself where did she go wrong
She didn't realize
She chased the type of guys
That don't believe in ties
Tryin' to apologize

Never forget the day
She laughed and walked away
And I couldn't stop her
I guess she had it all
She had it all figured out
But she left me with a broken heart
Fucked around and turned me down
Cause she didn't think I could play the part
But now the prom queen the prom queen
Is crying sittin' outside of my door
See you never know how
How everything could turn around

Get up!

She had it all figured out
But she left me with a broken heart
Fucked around and turned me down
Cause she didn't think I could play the part
But now the prom queen the prom queen
Is crying sitting outside of my door

Bad to the bristle, hat to the rizzle
I'm so official all I need is a whistle
Bitch named Crystal, let her suck my pistol
She opened up her mouth and then I blew her brains out
You ain't met a nigga like me, you probably never will
Riders rolling with me, like 11 wheels
Find out where you living, kill you in the kitchen

Outta this world though, I'm so sci-fi
And I don't sit still I keep it moving like a drive-by
I just tell the truth, so I'm cool in every hood spot
21 years and I ain't ever met a good cop

Aw yeah, Trey, I fuckin' feel ya
They be starin' at the money like it's unfamiliar
I get it, I live it, to me there's nothing realer
Just enough to solve your problems, too much'll kill ya
And when I leave, I always come right back here
The young spitter that everybody in rap fear
A lot of y'all are still sounding like last year
The game need change and I'm the motherfuckin' cashier
Nickels for my thoughts, dimes in my bed
Quarters of the kush shape the lines in my head
Take my verses too serious, you'll hate me
'Cause I'm the one to paint a vivid picture, no HD
Yeah, I want it all, that's why I strive for it
Diss me, you'll never hear a reply for it

Yeah, I want things to go my way
But as of late, a lot of shit been going sideways
And my mother tried to run away from home
But I left something in the car and so I caught her in the driveway
And she cried to me, so I cried too
And my stomach was soaking wet, she only five-two
And Forty, that was all before I showed up
And brought a thousand dollars worth of drinks and got poured up
Damn, my reality just set in
And even when the Phantom's leased, them hoes wanna get in
I do a lot of things hopin' I never have to fit in
So try to keep up with my progress, it's like a dead-end
My girl love me, but fuck it, my heart beats slow
And right now the tour bus is looking like a freak show
And life change for us every single week, so
It's good, but I know this ain't the peak though 'cause I want the

Back when I was tryna put a ring on Alisha hand
This lost boy got fly without Peter Pan
And my delivery just got me buzzing like the pizza man
In-person I am everything and more
I'm everywhere these other niggas never been before
But inside I'm treading water, steady tryna swim to shore
I'm on a shopping spree to get whatever is in store
Yeah, just call me ""Shopping Bag Drizzy""
Or call me Mr. ""Damn, he ain't coppin' that, is he?""

While this youngin' that you doubted is about to get busy

I just don’t know how to say it, to you

Uh, pardon the swag, but bitch it's Car-tey
Long bread, I don't eat shortcake, how come I can't
Miss a woman like I can't miss court dates
Cheese, but she's not in this portrait
And yeah, life's fine, but I don't portray
I'm on the other side, but it is a short gate
I don't want the glow, I want the glory
And I'ma fuck the world, but this is just foreplay
Tired of hearing bullshit, bring on the cow shit
Haven't met a smell that's stinkier than our shit

They must got a death wish
They was on the road to the riches back in the day they got off on the exit
Trill disrespect shit
Whenever a nigga try to fuck up your investment
It's hard to digest it
Young niggas don't want to get punched in they faces
So they keep the burner on, to catch a bunch of cases
These old niggas still think they livin' in the '80s
The shawties they knew since they were babies turn crazy
The bitches still holla at anybody
Lookin' like they have a couple dollars
Fuck suck and swallow
Ain't nobody winnin' but everybody can't lose
Dirts still there funeral home ain't move
Going in coming out gang affiliated
Rather go back before being humiliated
A black cloud over the hood you can't escape it
Dust smokin' niggas walk around in the matrix
Loyalty is thin, tension is thick
Look at a broke nigga's face when you mention a brick
Stick up kids come around, when they sense that you rich
Cans of lizzle get lit, when you get hit with a fifth
Niggas they used to hoop dreamin' is now sellin' the piff
And they still rattin' but you can't tell if you stiff
Especially when the tek spit, fuck around get your head and your neck hit
Lookin' for a death wish, walk

[Chorus: Jadakiss]
Talkin' out your mouth
All wreckless to a nigga that you know
That'll let it off
That's a death wish
When your heart stops and your body gets breathless
And help don't come in enough time
That's a death wish
When you see the blood, realize that your chest is hit
And don't know where it came from
That's a death wish
When you know a nigga whole style's on select shit
(young money)when you violate 'em, fwah
That's a death wish

Better get right or get left shit
Better hit right or get left, hit
Even if you threw the best pitch
Yes bitch

Motherfuck your guest list
I'll be like let's just kill 'em
And get breakfast
Neck slit, next shit expect this
Every time you check this
I'm exit I mean excited to be your death wish
Bitch I wear this G-shit on my heart not my necklace
And I keep the hypno' for the hecklers
And I'm from the mecca of the wreckless
With a record-breaking debt list
The wreckers and neglectors think all that shit won't affect us
I'm high above you above law above average

Blowing on saxophones, the band is rough
So much ice on looks like my wrist been cut
And we just made it back from Beijing
Seen my jeweler, told him melt the bird down to eight rings
And the music stopped, Jada stood up (yeah)
Before the speech, he had everybody raise they cups
He said, I been in spots where I can't even mention it
""Don't drink the Cris', Ghost might to pissed in it!""

Face slumped to the side like Rocky
Then Strahan came through, with his bullshit ring

I switch gear all day bro, like you do on your peach porch
The chairs is suede, the walls is velvet
Marquise ballroom, so live I felt it
Fat asses in fishnets, shaking they pelvis
Playing with they pussy, middle finger dripping, I smelt it
Poker tables, crap joints just for rap niggas

There go Rae, there go P

Gold was my motto, lotto numbers is what?

Bag Ugly Betty up, make her Ms. Guerrera

Taught me how to read, get skee'd, everybody missing a ki

Catch me by the munition Venetian scope on me, fuck it I'm losing it

Greek statues on both sides of the driveway
Word to the stamps on the diesel
The way these niggas is looking either they got cramps or they evil
One go we all go, D-boy fresh but hard dough
Cashmere and suede cargoes
On top of the beige Wallo's
45 government edition clippers, straight hollows
My 'Clientele is Supreme' and it's proven
That I'm 'Only Built 4 the Link' if it's Cuban
I'm a pioneer, I'm not a vet (uh-uh)
""Last Kiss"" is a French one, it's not a peck (uh-uh)
Moving powder, piff and a lot of wet

Kill the game no one recovers the murder weapon
Young angel if ya hate me tell me burn in heaven
How'd you sleep on me, the highest earning freshmen
Like ya third infection, I hope ya learned ya lesson
Yeah
I spit raw but I prefer protection
I own her heart and her mind, and the shirt she slept in
Bitch I got the answer, and still ain't heard the question
I shut ya club down, please reserve my section
Fuck a confrontation, there ain't no cakin' it
And I'm cakin' bitch, so tell me why I take a break from it
The mother of your child always tell you I'm her favorite
She call me her baby, not the one she was in labor with
She say 'oh you taste good', I say 'oh just savor it'
She know that she love a nigga, I be on that major shit
Cause I get paid to stand, and I get paid to sit
So I don't walk around with money, baby girl I'm made of it",F*** Da Bulls***,2009

Sittin' on the toilet, smokin' on some medicated

And the second is to get more of this shit that I'm counting
Call me J-2-0, I flow like a fountain
And I swear I beat the beat up till that bitch start ouchin'
Keep them bitches' asses bouncin', man we fly like a falcon
Comparing them to us is like a pebble to a mountain
I'm a uptown flamethrower young money fire starter
Had to sign to Wayne, I'm from the same place as ""Tha Carter"" Ha-Harlem
And I ain't like none of these other niggas
I get it, I spend it, your husband on a budget, Mrs.
Young Money cloud gang so above you niggas
Besides these groupies after the shows, who's fuckin' with us?
You might as well have a badge, the way you cuff them bitches
I slut them bitches, then back to the door, like fuck them bitches

Paper coming in money never going outward
Its young money yeah I hear a lot of niggas doubting
This here is God's work, ain't nothing you can do about it
So nigga join the team or you can catch the sideline
And just get out the game or get hit from the blind side
We makin' money while you niggas makin' petty quotes
You can make it rain, we make it flood like the levee broke
It's all about the paper, money control my whereabouts
About a year from now I'm tryin' to break that new McLaren out
Wheels of fortune on the whip, Vanna White in it
Bitch shotgun, probably be your wife in it
Hustle year round nothing come in front of that
Rap real estate and work, I can make a ton with that
Pay me in advance so I'm not coming bitch
Like Pain, Wayne and Mack Maine, I got money bitch

[Chorus]

Yeah, Young Money I'm the boss, you don't wanna come across
Money do somersaults, Bentley on young adults
Stuntin' on them hoes, it ain't me, its the money folk
Still make it rain, get struck by a money bolt
What it is though, I know what it ain't
Y'all go hard, I go to the bank
Check my check stubs, bitch it's Mack Maine
Young money up and runnin', join the campaign

Times ain't the same, shit been goin' bad
Bend a bitch over, pull some money out her ass
I'm tired of the game, 'cause it ain't what it was
The chopper's so close, I can give that bitch a hug
And a gangster need love, so I keep a gangster bitch
I got that dope dick, there ain't a bitch I can't addict
And I'm lookin' at the game, I roll my eyes
I looked at the clock and the hands were tied because

Whippin' in my jeans

Life's a game of chess, and I'm headed for your queen
Now my stomach and my thighs
What a head is in between (ew)
And she wetter than a stream, I drink medicine to lean
Keep a cup in my hand like I'm begging for some cheese
I fall off in the party
Yeah I'm kinda tardy but if I hated she'll be ridin' on 'em like a Harley
Look you call it getting married, I call it acting selfish

Life is, better than its ever been
Scheduling million dollar meetings with the president
Someone cut the lights on
Where is Thomas Edison
Got a new condo watch me as I settle in
I deserve a MTV show for me and my people
And if you tryna zone I got a whole swisha sweet full
Rappers are liars and they women are deceitful
Adding till they subtract me I never be a equal
Last place Drizzy is the nigga in the lead now
Weezy told me just write every single thing you need down
Then he got it for me and I'm happy as can be now
Bout to start ballin' like I'm coming off ofa rebound
Yea
And I should have the most bragging rights
Because a nigga spit crack, bag it tight
Hate when rappers say they tryna get they swagger right
Cause I done came wit mo' fire than a dragon fight
Fuck you pussy ass hater you should do you
You ain't heard of me then you should go and get a Blue's Clue
Oops I mean a red clue

Its heartbreak Drake I hate to see 'em so sad
I could son you, see a little me in yo' dad

Situations sticky got the homie toting two two's,
Comin' back old school,

Headed to the pen now he back up on the slab,
Big money of the ab,
Hundred G's in cash,

The dump truck,
A stash spot,
Then came up,
It's more 1's nigga,
Versace sheets,
Serve is more money in a new fleet

Bought a new Phantom,
Suede with the gators
Brand new Louis always ready to spray it,

These hoe's we don't trust,
Brand new trucks,
Shined every summer,
Ran wit the numbers,
Stash spot cool got a 50 piece humming
Back up on my saddle nigga hustle for my shine,
Just an ordinary nigga on a million dollar grind,
Big timer old school, new school nigga,
Is more money homie,
More money more money more money homie,

Get another Hundred,
Spend another Hundred,
Burn another Hundred,
Blow another Hundred,
Fuck another Hundred,

Garbage bag full hard body wit' a fire line,
Flip another brick, drink a little dip,
Stunna Island nigga shinin' wit a bad bitch,
A-R nigga, riding skinny tires,
Fully loaded high when you floatin' in the sky,
Rockin' Gucci blades, ridin' triple blades,
Tatts on the face, of nigga's been paid

And telling every girl she the one for me
And I ain't even planning to call

First name greatest
Like a sprained ankle boy ain't nothing to play with

I know G4 pilots on a first name basis
In your city faded off the brown, Nino
She insists she got more class, we know!
Swimming in the money come and find me, Nemo
If I was at the club you know I balled, chemo
Dropped the mixtape that shit sounded like an album
Who'd have thought a country wide tour would be the outcome
Labels want my name beside the X like Malcolm
Everybody got a deal, I did it without one
Yeah nigga I'm about my business
Killing all these rappers you would swear I had a hit list
Everyone who doubted me is asking for forgiveness
If you ain't been a part of it at least you got to witness

Forever ever Mr. West is in da building
Ain't no question who about to kill 'em
I used to have hood dreams
Big fame, big chains
I stuck my dick inside this life until that bitch came
I went hard all fall like the ball teams
Just so I can make it rain all spring
Y'all seen my story my glory
I had raped the game young
You can call it statutory
When a nigga blow up they can build statures of me
Old money Benjamin Button, what, nothin'
Now superbad chicks giving me McLovin,
You would think I ran the world like Michelle's husband
You would think these niggas would know me when they really doesn't
Like they was down with the old me no you fucking wasn't
You're such a fucking loser
He didn't even go to class Bueller
Trade the Grammy plaques just to have my granny back
Remember she had that bad hip like a fanny pack
Chasing that stardom would turn you into a maniac
All the way in Hollywood and I can't even act
They pull their cameras out and God damn they snap
I used to want this thing forever y'all can have it back

OK, hello it's the martian, Space Jam Jordan's
I want this shit forever wake up and smell the Garden
Fresher than the harvest
Step up to the target
If I had one guess than I guess I'm just New Orleans
And I will never stop like I'm running from the cops
Hopped up in my car and told my chauffeur to the top
Life is such a fucking roller coaster then it drops
But what should I scream for this is my theme park
My minds shine even when my thoughts seem dark
Pistol on my side you don't wanna hear that thing talk
Let the king talk check the price and pay attention
Lil Wayne that's what they got to say or mention
I'm like Nevada in the middle of the summer
I'm resting in the lead I need a pillow and a cover
Shh, my foot's sleeping on the gas
No brake pads no such thing as last

There they go, packing stadiums
As Shady spits his flow
Nuts they go, macadamian they go so ballistic wow
We can make them look like bozos
He's wondering if he should spit this slow
Fuck no go for broke
His cup just runneth over oh no
He ain't had a buzz like this since the last time he overdosed
They've been waiting patiently for Pinocchio to poke his nose
Back into the game and they know
Rap will never be the same as before
Bashing in the brains of these hoes
And establishing a name as he goes
The passion and the flame is ignited
You can't put it out once we light it
This shit is exactly what the fuck I'm talking about when we riot
You dealin' with a few true villains
Whose staying inside of the booth truth spillin'
And spit true feelings
Til our tooth fillings come flying up out of our mouths, now rewind it
Payback muthafucka for the way you got at me so hows it taste?
When I slap the taste out your mouth
With the bass so loud that it shakes the place
I'm Hannibal Lecter so just in case you're thinking of saving face
You ain't gonna have no face to save
By the time I'm through with this place, so Drake

Got the girl twisted 'cause she open when you twist her

Stop playing, bitch, I got this game on deadbolt
Mind so sharp, I fuck around and cut my head off
Real nigga all day and tomorrow
But these mu'fuckers talking crazy like they jaw broke
Glass half empty, half full, I'll spill ya
Try me and run into a wall, outfielder
You know I'ma ball 'til they turn off the field lights
The fruits of my labor, I enjoy 'em while they still ripe
Bitch, stop playing, I do it like a king do
If these niggas animals, then I'ma have a mink soon
Tell 'em bitches I say put my name on the wall
I speak the truth, but I guess that's a foreign language to y'all
And I call it like I see it, and my glasses on
But most of y'all don't get the picture 'less the flash is on
Satisfied with nothing, you don't know the half of it

Paper chasing, tell that paper, ""Look, I'm right behind ya""

You niggas are gelatin, peanuts to an elephant

Jumped in a wishing well, now wish me well

Add some bravado 
Get wealthy likes Wells Fargo 
Its truth, that I am you 
And I am proof 
Surviving through 
We do what we gotta do

Then maybe put our sons and our daughters in private school

Woke up this morning, feeling all horny
Picked up my pistol, fucked my opponent
The roof on dismissal, the feet are enormous
They on the same shit we switched up the toilets
I looked in the mirror and I said what's happening?
The mirror said “you are, you conceited bastard!""
Well that's true, the Coupe look like it came with the wheels
Because it got a paper tags still
And the passengers a pill away from being DOA
Down on her ass freak for the chips, Frito lay
And the waiter shorty move throw it thisa way
When the players hit the club nigga leave some way
Cause we as real as they soldiers in the field
Cause we fighting for something but we don't know what it is
I'm trying to get higher than last months bills
Cause this months here, this one's clear
This one's brown, this one's beer
Man we got it lookin' like a bar in the VIP
The flow is contagious and deadly like Rabies
Had your girl in the suite swallowin' babies
But that is irrelevant it was all a pre-requisite
Nigga I'm ill, nigga I need medicine
Like Excedrin cause it's this big
Broke my dishwasher and bought a new crib

We at the pool and she lookin' like a center fold
Two tattoos but she say she gettin' plenty more
She got Indian in her family, Seminole
Me and shawty go together like chemicals
And she get mad when I call other woman hoes
You send a rose, I pick some flowers and send her those
Tall glass of Merlot get her in the mode
Two tall glasses of Merlot get her out her robe
I whisper in her ear, than lick around her lobe
And when she check her watch, it's never time to go
And with her brain she should make the honor roll
And when I came, she caught me like the common cold.

Either way I, don't wanna wake up from you

Yo, young money right here,
Bike here, throw it up, no high chair,
Cold like a white bear,
Freddie Kruger I'm a rap bitch nightmare,
And I'm rich I could buy you,
Kill bitches leave ya body in a bayou,
More brain than an IQ,
More head than a dread,
And my bank account ain't hardly empty,
So I come through in a Barbie Bentley,
But please mamacita, please no envy,
When you come around it reads no entry,
Who's next to go,
My flows so flexible,
Get gassed get at me, Texaco,
Shoot yourself in the leg, Plexico
White jag with the twisted lip,
I ain't Mike Jack but This is it!
Born born born everywhere,
Your like balloon boy mama you was never there!
I am the kung fu panda,
Fuck all of your blogs, fuck all your propaganda,
Good for the goose then it's good for the gander,
Nicki ain't a rapper, nicki is a brander,
Please you can never compare to me,
All these bitches is scared of me,
I am who they couldn't even dare to be,
So that's all folks
I go hard pause,
Hospital flow get more gauze,
I'm a bad bitch on all fours,
The president be like it's all yours,
Weezy and Nicki bring the A-game, high stats,
Go together like Ricky and his eye patch,
Go together like a team in the gym,
Kareem in the ring, the queen and the king,

Tattoo your name across my heart
So it will remain
Not even death can make us part
(No Ceilings)
What kind of dream is this!
You could be a sweet dr

Kush it out, red bone pussy mouth,
Eat you up, spit you out,
Fuck your girl in your house,
I'm terrible be careful,
You might want say a prayer or two,
So cold I need theraflu,
I'm so high I need parachutes,
I'm error proof, I'm never spooked,
Got my crew, heaven blue,
And my flag red as hell, think your sweet as devils food,
I never lose,
My weapons use,
Fuck with me wrong, shit get ugly, Devin Dude,
And she's the queen,
Two's a couple, three's a scene,
Weezy that nigga that you see in your dreams,
Get the pussy wet or be the springs, huh, I'm Easter clean,
Shout to my home girl Mika Means,
Anything we want we redeem,
You niggas gassed up '93 supreme,
Nicki Minaj is the hardest bitch,
More than an artist bitch,
She talk a whole lot of shit
And walk around like she President Carters bitch,
She be on her Barbie shit,
And me I'm on the carter 6,
And I can turn crumbs to bricks,
And I can turn nuns to tricks,
Young mula baby,
Fu-fuck your feelings,
And this is No Ceilings
Yeah

Give her dope dick, now she under the sedation
Wake her in the morning, breakfast where she slept at
Tell her go shopping, I can't wait til she get back

She said it's her dick, she got it copyrighted
And I don't pay for pussy because her pussy's priceless

They call me a freak 'cause I like to spit on these pussies 'fore I eat them
Man get these whack cocksuckers off stage, where the fuck is Kanye when you need him?
Snatch the mic from him, bitch I'mma let you finish in a minute,
Yeah that rap was tight, but I'm 'bout to spit the greatest verse of all time
So you might want to go back to the lab tonight and um
Scribble out them rhymes you were gonna spit and start over from scratch and write new ones
But I'm afraid that it ain't gonna make no difference
When I rip this stage and tear it in half tonight
It's an adrenaline rush to feel the bass thump in the place
All the way to the parking lot, fellow
Set fire to the mic and ignite the crowd
You can see the sparks from hot metal
Cold-hearted from the day I Bogarted the game I so started
To rock fellow, when I'm not even in my harshest
You can still get roasted 'cause Marsh is not mellow
'Til I'm toppling from the top I'm not going to stop, I'm standing on my Monopoly board
That means I'm on top of my game and it don't stop, 'til my hip don't hop anymore
When you're so good that you can't say it 'cause it ain't even cool for you to sound cocky anymore
People just get sick 'cause you spit, these fools can't drool or dribble a drop anymore
And you can never break my stride,
You never slow the momentum at any moment I'm about to blow
You'll never take my pride, killing the flow, slow venom and the opponent is getting no
Mercy, mark my words, ain't letting up, relentless I smell blood,
I don't give a fuck, keep giving them hell
Where was you when I fell and needed help up? You get no love

It's a little too late to say that you're sorry now (Oh)
You kicked me when I was down, but what you say, just (Don't hurt me)
Yeah that's right (It don't hurt me) And I don need you (No more)
Don't wanna see you (No more)
Ha bitch you get (No love) You showed me nothing but hate (Yeah)
You ran me into the ground, but what comes around goes around
(And you don't hurt me) That's right (You don't hurt me) and I don't need you (No more)
Don't want to see you, (No more)
Ha bitch you get no love
No love
No love
No love, ha
Bitch you get no love

No love, and I don't need you (No more)

People, they will judge you cause they just don't understand 
You're in it for the long ride, you don't just give up on a man 
And like every woman who's been through the fire as well 
We ALL got a story half afraid to tell, yeah

Then hang up my pants, now I got monsters in my closet

You need this in your life (yeah)
ven aquí

I'm gonna give you instructions
You just gotta follow my lead
Your body's making sounds like percussions
I'm orchestrating your fantasies

And when you wake up feeling like a dream
You ain't gone believe it
And everything you need
Girl u gone receive it tonight
And I know your condition
I'ma make you feel alive
Relax and feel the ride

So act like it's the last time
The last chance for you to go there

There's one ticket left
And girl it's for you baby
The last ride, and girl you won't
Find this feeling nowhere
You better hurry cause the train is leaving

All aboard (come on móntate mami)

I use these words as persuasion
I don't got a reason to speak
It's always a special vacation
Every time you're laying with me

And when you wake up feeling like a dream
You ain't gonna believe it
And everything you need
Girl you're gonna receive it tonight
And I know your condition
I'ma make you feel alive

So act like it's the last time
The last chance for you to go there
There's one ticket left
And girl it's for you baby
The last ride, and girl you wont
Find this feeling nowhere
You better hurry cause the train is leaving

All aboard

She want to ride that Wayne train
So I'ma bag her like baggage claim
Then smoke that Mary, in the plane, Jane
And everything is just fine
I keep a picture of her smile
In the back of my mind
I grab the back of her head
She throw it back like rewind

I put her face in the pillow
Taste it a little
Shorty said she feel like
She sitting on a missile

I say 5, 4, 3, 2
One can only be you
Shanty said oh lord I'm coming
I say me too
My love has no equal
Get on top
And if you ride this train
Get off at your stop

And when you wake up feeling like a dream
You ain't gone believe it
And everything youu need
Girl u gone receive it tonight
And I know your condition
I'ma make you feel alive
Relax and feel the ride

This is the last time
The last chance for you to go there

There's one ticket left
And girl it's for you baby
The last grind, and girl you won't
Find this feeling nowhere
You better hurry cause the train is leaving

All aboard

You had a lot of crooks try'na steal your heart
Never really had luck, couldn't never figure out
How to love (how to love)
How to love (how to love)
Mm you had a lot of moments that didn't last forever
Now you in the corner try'na put it together
How to love (how to love)
How to love (how to love)

Mm for a second you were here, now you over there
It's hard not to stare, the way you moving your body
Like you never had a love (had a love)
Never had love (had a love)

When you was just a youngin', your looks were so precious
But now your grown up, so fly it's like a blessing
But you, can't have a man look at you for five seconds
Without you being insecure
You never credit yourself so when you got older
It's seems like you came back ten times over
Now you're sitting here in this damn corner
Looking through all your thoughts and looking over your shoulder

See you had a lot of crooks try to steal your heart
Never really had luck, couldn't never figure out
How to love (how to love, how to love)

It's hard not to stare, the way you moving your body
Like you never had a love (had a love)
How to love (how to love)

Ooh, you had a lot of dreams that transform to visions
The fact that you saw the world affected all your decisions
But it wasn't your fault, wasn't in your intentions
To be the one here talking to me, be the one listening

But I admire your poppin' bottles and dippin'
Just as much as you admire bartending and strippin'
Baby, so don't be mad, nobody else trippin'
You see a lot of crooks and the crooks still crook

You see you had a lot of crooks try to steal your heart
Never really had luck, couldn't never figure out
How to love (how to love)
How to love (how to love)
Mm see you had a lot of moments that didn't last forever
Now you in this corner try'na put it together
How to love (how to love)

Ooh, see I just want you to know (You to know)
That you deserve the best
You're beautiful, you're beautiful
Yeah, and I want you to know
You're far from the usual, far from the usual

Coming through shining
Blew a couple of hundreds
Big timing all the time, nigga been stuntin'
Pearl white Maybach, nigga spent a mill
Bugatti for 2, on the hill
Shining with my strap in my right pocket
Hundred thousand a day on that sky rocket
From round the block doing this shit round the clock
Million dollar nigga doing this sh-t non-stop
Swagged out, big dogging on a private flight
Popping bottles, celebrating living life
Blowing big, freelander down ?
YMCMB nigga, rich gang

Ugh, big dawg shit nigga
I'm on my feet like dog shit nigga
Tell 'em hatin' n-ggas miss me with that hatin' shit
And tell them bitches, my dick got a waiting list
I ain't trippin' nigga I'm just taking trips
Put the money on the trampoline and make it flip
Young mack, stupid mack ?
I just bought a coupe, the roof is translucent
Pockets on etc, money talk bullsh-t, walk like George Jefferson
Virgins they ain't fucking with us
Young money cash money
Fuck them other n-ggas

I don't play with you p-ssies get a silver bullet
I know you looking so how I look

It's tunechi baby, the money man
The money talks, now I understand
That chopper make a nigga do the running man
I would take a girl and turn her p-ssy to a punching bag
I'ma stunt my ass off, bitch that's word to stunna man
School these bitch ass n-ggas, you are undergrad
The world is in my hand, smack the shit out you with my other hand

Verse 1:
Dear Anne
My number 1 fan
I write with the light from the lamp on my nightstand
With my pen in my right hand
And that's also my mic hand
Codeine in the sprite can
Ink on the white pad
And I'm thinking of life, Anne
And wrong and right, Anne
And sometimes I'm right
And sometimes I might
Ca-can I find the light?
Still my rhymes are bright
So I continue my plan
And I'm sure (shore) like white sand
That they'll be price payin'
Before my flight land
But still, I want to see more than my sight can
Adore, so I can't ignore
What I want anymore
So I just go, you can call me the Gore
And oh yeah
I got a girl, she act like I owe her
And um, sometimes it seems like I just don't know her
And yeh, the relationship is starting to feel like a chore
But I really hope I'm not starting to bore

I hope everything's grand
I hope everyone's good
I hope everybody's praying

I hope ? hold up baby, let me switch hands
See, lately I've been dealing with a lot of shit and
It's burning me and I can't get out of this pan
And every time I look there's a problem with this man
But I ain't tryna expose, I'm just tryna expand
But your support held me up like kickstands
And I'm also being more careful in how I pick friends
And I'm tryna stay up out them chick's pants
(Laughs) but, I just can't
But, on another note, this ain't just another note
This is more than a rap
This is more of an oath
And I know you're wondering what this letter is for
And I'm just hoping that you read this far

By now you probably think I'm portraying who I'm sayin
And sometimes I wish I wasn't him, but I am
And it's people like you that make me part of what I am
But hey, you are the shit
Damn, pardon the gram (grammar)
But it's like you make me feel like I'm a part of the fam
And shit, when my life be like some sort of exam
It's a jungle out there- lions, horses and rams
Shit, as I sit and wait for the war to began
I just think of you, then I'm rewarded again
And, with you, is where my artistry can
And, so with you is where a part of me stands
And, I hope I see you in the stands

And, and I'm sorry about Stan

I guess she’s feeling kinda freaky lately
It’s such a shame cause now the pussy’s changed

Grip me tight enough so she could please me
But nah-nah, that pussy changed

You the primer on the lime bean green box
When I couldn’t afford a Ford
Clean sox scootin’ across the floor in your grandmama house
Hand on your mouth
You yap too much about the Penny-Ante
This mechanic’s so uncanny, X-men, X-men
Your ex boyfriend should thank me that I took you off his hands
Know I can bring another beach to the sand
And know I am well aware that you can bring a man to his knees
and get what you need without saying please
But can you bring a man to his feet when defeat is on repeat
And they put this man’s Grammy’s on the street?
What? Why so quiet?
Hate that all of our memories happened in a Hyatt?
You were perfect before you went on a diet
You was way thicker, you think I don’t remember
Shit, the magazine got to your head
Now somebody you don’t even know got you in bed
Betcha buddy don't even know you don’t like red
Or was it fuchsia, fuck it, Our future is dead.

I thought the pussy cat had 9 lives man?

Lil Wayne,"[Chorus]
I'm dealing with this love affair
It used to be just physical
But now it's just too emotional for me
I want to confess but I can't 
Tell my girl what I want
So what do I do?
Let it burn inside of me?
Or will I get away?
Or will it end in tragedy?

Fatal attraction
Ready for action
She had a body like Ms. Jackson
I knew that it was trouble when she passed by
But she was so fly
She invited me over 
So I hopped in the Rover
Then my lady called the phone 
And I should have went home
But I let the phone roam

And it was like oh
I can't keep my shirt on
I swear I'm like oh
I can't keep my hands to myself

[Chorus]

I swear that I was done 
I'm never going back
Then she called me up
She said I left my hat
You know I can't live without my hat
I got an excuse to double back y'all
So you know I'm gone have a ball
I said I'm going back y'all 
But knowing me that's not all

And it was like oh
I can't keep my shirt on
I swear it's like oh
I can't keep my hands to myself

[Chorus] 

I got a main bitch and mistress
I'm tryna' work it out
 I'm on my fitness
It probably won't last 
But I'm optimistic
One makes me happy 
The other makes a difference
I ain't a playa
But I love a lot
She loves me
She loves me not
But it feel good
And it's not supposed to
I eat her insides
Mmm soul food
She put her head back
Then her eyes close
We stuck in the moment
Like the time froze
Then my girl call
Back to reality 
But I keep her in a picture in my heart gallery

Oh
I can't keep my shirt on
I swear I'm like oh
I can't keep my hands to myself

I'm no angel
There so much I can take
Calm down, patience
Don't lose your temper hold on wait
I've got issues just like you
Sometimes I get so confused
I'm strong but I can break
I'll be praying so hard
To get through the day
Bad thoughts in my mind I can't shake
Having nightmares in the day can you relate?

Please somebody kindly wake me
I can't let this cold world take me
I'm looking

My drama, my karma
My love my life, dear moma
The war’s I’ve fought, scars that I’ve garnered
The hustle, I got that honest from my father
Mix me with violence, blend me with peace
Combine me with hate and I can’t face defeat (nope)
I did it all in a week
Still incomplete as I stand on my feet
It take a lot to still dance to the beat
Skin more cold and callous than concrete
I love swimming but there's just one ski
In a rich man’s chique hotel with bed sheets
Uh ah, you know what I’m looking for

Looking for someone to love me

Everybody pushing but I don’t fall back
And everybody looking but blind to the fact
The clock on the wall say it’s time for some action
Now you can take that to the bank and cash in
I’m feeling myself, fuck if they feeling me
Can’t spell them without me
It’s them or me
Yesterday was a memory
Looking in the mirror at my enemy
But today I’m

Looking for someone to love me
I'm-I'm-I'm-I'm looking for someone to love me
Yeh-yeh-yeah

My rise, my falls
Enemies wanna see me crawl
My ups, my downs
Ya’ll know I’ve been around
But sometimes it bothers me
When I hear people say a non truth
Am I sane, am I crazy
Pick one there all the same
In this World we’re living in

Me, I’m just proud of the fact that you’ve done it your way
And the weekends here started it right
Even if you only get part of it right
Live for today, plan for tomorrow
Party tonight, party tonight
Dying to meet your girlfriends
That you said you might bring
If they’re the ones that tell you that you do the right thing

Houston girls, love the way it goes down
Atlanta girls, love the way it goes down
Vegas girls, love the way it goes down

But I gotta say, oh babe, oh babe, why is this so familiar?
Just may already feel like I know the real her
You must’ve done this before, this can’t be your first time
We must’ve been here before, it’s still fresh on my mind
You got that shit that somebody would look for but won’t find
You must’ve done this before, this can’t be your first time

They keep telling me don’t save you
If I ignore all that advice
Then something isn’t right
Then who will I complain to?
But the weekends here started it right
Even if I only get part of it right
Live for today, plan for tomorrow
Party tonight, party tonight
You got your guards up, I do too. There’s things we might discover
Cause you got a path and I do too, we’re perfect for each other

Houston girls, love the way it goes down
Atlanta girls, love the way it goes down
Vegas girls, love the way it goes down

But I gotta say, oh babe, oh babe, why is this so familiar?
Just may already feel like I know the real her
You must’ve done this before, this can’t be your first time
We must’ve been here before, it’s still fresh on my mind
You got that shit that somebody would look for but won’t find
You must’ve done this before, this can’t be your first time

Cause to her I’m just a rapper, and soon she’ll have met another
So if tonight’s an accident, tomorrow we’ll recover
And I know I’m not supposed to judge a book by its cover
I don’t wanna be in the blind, but sometimes I Stevie Wonder
About her, and she with it if I’m with it, and I’m with it
I know what makes her smile, but I won’t know what makes her different
Or should I just be realistic? Lipstick on the glass
I know this ain’t your first, but it’s better than your last, Tunechi

You must’ve done this before, this can’t be your first time
We must’ve been here before, it’s still fresh on my mind
You got that shit that somebody would look for but won’t find
You must’ve done this before, this can’t be your first time

Shower her with dollar tips
Shawty went and bought a whip
Guarantee the city remember your whole name
You throw the ho a scholarship
All of them ain't all equipped
And this saddens me, I see the pecking order
Quote-unquote ""bad bitches"" work the whole floor
Those that get laughed at sit off in the corner
Like a lab rat nobody want her
Niggas that are married don't wanna go home
But we look up to them, they wish they were us
They want some new trim
We lust for some trust
Now the both of us are colourblind
Cause the other side looks greener
Which leaves your turf in the Boise state
Can't see her play or the team, 'cuz
Everybody has an addiction, mine happens to be you
And those who say they don't
Souls will later on say to them ""that ain't true""
All of them will have an opinion
But y'all know what you can do with them
But if you unsure, I'll take you on tour
To a place you can stick that in
Well, sitting here sad as hell
Listening to Adele, I feel you baby
Someone like you, more like someone unlike you
Or someone that's familiar maybe
And I can tell that she wants a baby
And I can yell ""Girl, that shit crazy!""
Oh what the hell? Nope, can't be lazy
Please be careful, bitches got the rabies",The Real Her,2011

Peep the whip and the logo
24's and they low pro

Riding round with that rocket
Load it up and I cock it
Send bout a couple off in your nog
And hear them 808's and they knocking
Whole club and they rocking
Rose in them buckets
All my homies up in here vibing
Nigga big shit in my household
Real niggas I die for
Creeping off in that Tahoe

I spiked them whole damn shoe for you assholes
I used to stunt my black card for my new broads
Now I just whip the four-door, oh my gosh

Wait til we come with Matt reds and Matt Blues

Got a Lamborghini, that's my son's toy
Where the flip did I get that paper
Shades on I cant see you haters
Taking off when I see you later

Walk on the moon, flow hotter than June

Peace to my man 'Tune for giving his man room
Now we hittin' switches to the Spring Break, Cancun
Get it, nah forget it, soo woo I live it
Made the letter B more famous than a Red Sox fitted
But that was suicide, I don't live in Judah's eyes
Half of these rappers weren't trappin' when I was choppin' the do or die
Suge had me in, I went Puffy like Zab Judah eye
Dre called, told my baby momma ""won't you decide""
She chose Doc, first day I pulled Jude aside like its Aftermath for life
And all I do is ride
Before I turn on him I kill Satan
And stick my red flag in the ground it's red nation!

Now blood the fuck up
Everyday's a gamble motherfucker, tough luck
And we gon' fuck the world til that bitch bust nuts
I can't tell ya whats good, but I can tell ya whats, what

Live and die for this shit, word to Tupac Shakur's halo

I'm up out the hood, where they pull guns on you like
Come up out ya hood, it ain't never all good
We roll up in backwoods, nigga get to actin' stupid
Get thrown in the back woods
Los Angeles, home of the scandalous
Pimp, hoes and gamblers
Ninety eight degree's on Christmas
Nigga we rollin' cannibus
Swisha sweet ain't it, I told her I'm Charles Louboutin
The bitch fainted, pulled her panites down, stain it
That's my Chi-lingo, yeah I'm bi-lingual
Ball by myself nigga Ochocinco
Dancing with the stars, bullets and fast cars
And everybody bleed out here, word to God

Now blood the fuck up

Louisville slugger, you'll get buried in my New Era
Got that natty on tighter than a magnum
Walk in the club saggin' with a thirty eight magnum
Red Ralph Laurens, the double R sittin' on a hill like Lauren
Her and the car foreign
Got my red Dre Beats on, tryna put my peeps on
And I keep it hood like this Phantom is a Nissan
Where my nigga Jim Jones at?
Roll up the weed son, so many bloods in Compton had to get a NYC song
And while I'm out here, I might as well go shopping
And put this new bad bitch I got her some red bottoms
And all these hatin' ass niggas want me dead

Lil Wayne,"I see you with your palms in your pants
But me, me, see me, I got the world in my hands
I make it spin on my finger, I'm a critical thinker
I'm a hell of a smoker, and a bit of a drinker

I see you with your palms in your pants
But me, me, see me, I got the world in my hands

I'm a hell of a smoker, and a bit of a drinker

I know your name, yeah
Your name is unimportant
We in the belly of the beast
And she thinking 'bout abortion

I woke up this morning, dick rock hard
Ashed my blunt in my Grammy Award
You can save your bullshit on your memory card
If this real nigga business, then you niggas unemployed
Jumped on the celly, called Machiavelli
He says he was gravy, I say I was jelly
Looked in the mirror, said ""You's an ill nigga""
Then I ran to the money like track and field nigga
Now I think I'll have me a coffee with six sugars
In a world full of ass-kissers and dick pullers
I'm tryna walk a straight line but the line crooked
I'm shooting for the stars, astronauts dodge bullets
Yeah, I bought a brand new attitude
The haters music to my ears, I got my dancin' shoes
Sometimes we question shit that there is no answer to
But I just built a house on ""I don't give a fuck"" Avenue

I see you with your palms in your pants
But me, me, see me, I got the world in my hands
I make it spin on my finger, I'm a critical thinker
I'm a hell of a smoker, and a bit of a drinker

I know your name, yeah
Your name is unimportant
We in the belly of the beast
And she thinking 'bout abortion

Down on the ceiling, looking up at the bed
Life is a gamble better check the point spread
And when life sucks, I just enjoy the head
I'm so sick of these niggas, I need meds
Smoking on a hallelujah, thank you Jesus
Help me focus on the future and not the previous
Double R, I'm a rebel with a reason
Sometimes you gotta fight the devil with a demon
Blood is in the streets and it is up to my knees
Underground shit, I see myself as a seed
Living in the glass, and everybody's looking
But how can you get the picture, if you don't know who took it?
This current affairs, but who the hell cares?
Everybody's fighting over positions, musical chairs
On the road to redemption, go on and use a few stairs
I'm just fucking ready so I come prepared yeah

I know your name, yeah
Your name is unimportant
We in the belly of the beast
And she thinking 'bout abortion damn

And the rockets red glare, the bombs bursting in air
Life is a roller coaster, but still unfair
A blessing in disguise is right before our eyes
But since it is in disguise, we don't know that it's there

And I see you with your palms in your pants

I was the one that you came to
When you broke up with your boyfriend
Man, fuck him
Girl I was the one, that told you fuck them other niggas
And you still with fuck them other niggas
Most people learn from the bad things
I hope that you learn
And don't crash and burn in the fast lane
But if you read this letter then you caught me
This should explain all the ways that you taught me

How to hate a bitch
That owe you everything
At least a wedding ring

No really, I'm on my ""fuck that bitch"" shit
You used to be the shit, but now you ain't shit, bitch
I had a red bone, but she be tripping though
All that bullshit is for the birds, she was pigeon-toed
She used to always say, fuck my niggas
And when I went to jail, she fucked my niggas
Well, I guess I'm single for the night
And you can sit right on my middle finger for the night
And if I sound mad, then you caught me

And I heard you're doing you, and you heard I'm doing better
And all I had to do was put two and two together
But that just makes four, but not four-ever, damn
So much for being the perfect couple
I put in overtime, I was working doubles
I wish you the best, good luck boo
Weezy F, for fuck you

No ain't nothing going on
Girl I'm moving on, just take your ass home
Get away from here, girl I'm so glad you're gone

I don't want you 'round me

Good wasn't home, so I settled for better
I'm on my way to get it, but get it got shot
So I guess I gotta work with the little bit I got
Now I'm like ""Hey, I like the view from here!""
I'm so high I can't see you from here
Both eyes on the money, it's looking back at me
Man, these bitches just looking for a daddy
Pussy getting problems, can't live without 'em
The weed too loud, turn up the volume
Richer than a bitch, but I can't buy tomorrow
That's why I go hard, ho (That's why I go hard, ho)

God bless the world, and most people in it
It's anybody's game, but nobody's winning
Mona Lisa smile, that bitch barely grinning
Take you off the face of the Earth like a blemish
We went from Boyz to Menace, Menace II Society
Now we get high-ya!, call that shit karate
Blame it on the money, the money is the bad guy
Smoke so much good, I don't even have a bad side
Yeah, I got a pussy hangover
Bitches eat me up like my name is Russell Stover
Murder the perception, make 'em get it right
If I'm flirting with perfection, I'm fucking her tonight
I'm a Southern delight, Louisiana pride
The belly of the beast, it ate me alive
Tell them bitches they'll never take me alive
Ever today that I took a walk outside

Ugh, and we all kiss our mommas
Cause promises are broken, but tomorrow isn't a promise
Think I'm getting sick, I'm feelin' ill-egal
And not having money is the root of all evil
Life is a midget so try to live it up
It's Doctor Carter bitch, I got this shit nipped and tucked
If these walls could talk, they'd probably won't shut up
I need some wallpaper, before they start the fuss
Yeah, pick up the phone and call yo block
Call Mitchell Carmone, now my pockets all bumped
I don't think about the future, it comes soon enough
Motherfucker I don't shoot you, bitch I shoot ya up
I ain't ride with these niggas, I don't like these niggas
I just roll another joint, white spike with these niggas
When I woke up this morning, got the cold out my eyes
And then I took a walk outside

To bust a nut and take a nigga's dame with' no shame
When they be bussin' 'nough, they thinkin' they thuggin' tough

No car doors, whatcha call those? A whole carload of raw hoes
In a Jeep Defender, please remember, don't feed the Simba
Three's a symbol like nobody, he's a symbol of what's safari
Pulled her ponytail to my body,
She's the only girl that was smart enough
To call me Mr. Benjamin in the middle of a wild party
Skin was cinnamon, I pound it harder,
How come the only girls that are thought of
Are the light ones?
Well, tonight, then, we gon' do it, do it, do it for the dark ones

Poverty and heroin, it's no place for a juvenile
Put greed in our heart, it's the green that we want
Cash Money is the company and Weezy the boss!

They say I'm underrated, but un-compete-with-able
Understandable, being that my rating levels are unreachable
Anything said other than that should be silenced, unspeakable!
And the thought of you being nicer than me, unfeasible!
They ask is what I do ever gonna stop, this shit will never end
That's when you hear a car crash in the vocal booth got 'em sayin' ""there he goes again!""
See now they nominated a nigga to come and
Flatten everything now let me dominate it, nigga run
And they be knowin' that I be blackin' on everything
And make it complicated like a nigga constipated with a gun
I gotta make it what they want and wake ‘em when I come
And shake 'em and bake 'em and take 'em to another place

Shout out to Uncle Luke
Shout out my bitches too
We the 2 Live Crew
2 for me, 2 for you (woo!)
Feed them bitches carrots
Fuck ‘em like a rabbit
Sorry that's a habit
Smoke a spliff and then I vanish

I'm about being single, seeing double, making triple
I hope you pussy niggas hating never make a nickel
It's good to make it better when your people make it wit' cha'
Money coming, money going, ain't like you could take it wit' cha'
It's about to be a hit right now, fuck back then we the shit right now
Dropped Take Care, bought a mothafuckin' crib
And I'm pickin' up the keys to that bitch right now
OVO that's major shit, Toronto with me that's mayor shit
Gettin' cheddar packs like KD, OKC that's player shit
We don't dress alike, we don't rap alike
I shine different, I rhyme different
Only thing you got is some years on me
Man fuck you and your time difference
I'm Young Papi, champagne
They know the face and they know the name
Got one watch that could probably pay for like all your chains
And you'd owe me change, ah!
Greystone, twenty bottles that's all me
On the couch, wildin' out yelling free my niggas 'til they all free
One of my closest dawgs got three kids and they all three
But we always been that type of crew that been good without a plan B so

Don't stop, pop that, don't stop
Pop that pop that pop that
Don't stop, pop that, don't stop

Okay I fuck a bitch and I'm gone
That’s gangsta, Al Capone

Known to act a donkey on the camel-toe
Then take the camel-toe and turn it into casserole
2 Chainz talkin' on the flex phone
Poof! Just like that the whole check gone
Former posturepedic I was slept on
So many chains on it look like my neck gone
My girl came through and brought an extra body
Now that's an after party for the after party
Two-gun game, all-black Ferrari
His and her Armani, put it in a tonic
And yeah, the bread good if the head good
Before Benihana's it was canned goods
Before canned goods it was Similac
I'm from where they send shots then we send 'em back
A half a million dollars worth of crack money
Wrap your parents up, now you got a black mommy
Yeah I did it, true to my religion
Two guns on me, both with extensions
If you on the pole, play your position
I got enough dough to pay your tuition
Corduroy Trues, with the skull cap
I just woke up, tell me where the drugs at
And after the drugs, where the girls at
And after the girls, where the love at
And if it ain't no love, I'm like fuck that

Two big chain, one big chopper, bitch

I got the chopper for the cold response
The codine got me standin' horizontal

So I'm in a room full of Pocahontas's
And this shit is off the meat rack
Weed sack, big car, layin' with my seat back

Turn that nigga into hot bologna
I'm the type a nigga cop a Rolly, cop a Benz, cop a two
Then wear it all to Church, nigga Hallelu
