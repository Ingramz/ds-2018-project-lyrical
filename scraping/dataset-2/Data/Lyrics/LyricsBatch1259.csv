Walls of Jericho,"Do you ever want to leave yourself 
And let misfortune take your soul? 
Worthless heavy heart 
As I turn the switch and throw it away 

Misery seeps on my skin 
And I sit and stare numb and mute 
Can anything else I touch break? 
Carry me away pain 

Look through the framework 
And impale my disgust 
Mistrust 
I have nothing 

None of it 
Please join in, but do you deserve it? 
I beat fulfillment into white walls 
Fuck it we all cry 

And hate life as we choose it 
Bit by bit by broken piece we kill it 
We grasp heavily as blood and 
Tears drip through our hands 

The light in my eyes 
Unsettled in my actions 
Kill them",Home Is Where the Heart Is,1999
Walls of Jericho,"And what am I to you? 
Hopefully not a piece of misconception 
That life's rule has pounded into your head 
Why is there a difference? 

Why is it appealing? 
Pain - oppression 
You're feeding off our insecurities 
They're living off your fucking tyrannical lies 

How can you degrade the ones 
You've claimed to love? 
How can you degrade the ones 
You've claimed to call equal? 

And you think our pleasure justifies 
Our self destruction 
That you've bought into here?
Let me strip down to my bare skin 

Let me show you what you call equal 
A rotting corpse is what you will have 
Left in your hand 
It used to be equable but 

You won't conceive of it 
You defy it",Misanthropy,1999
Walls of Jericho,"Unspoken contributions 
A fragment of contemporary fundamentals 
Completion factor 
Ripping two cells abundantly 
Torment that's causing inner perspective 
So untouched by the possessed clutches that resist 
Plentiful pains bruise my uncanny veins 
Supplement reoccurring is approaching 
The laceration is contradicting 
Completion of the two is so important 
To be able to proceed, 
For me it's ended unwanted",Unwanted Resistance,1999
Walls of Jericho,"You were there when I cried, I screamed 
It would not be forgotten 
A slave to the poison that dragged us down 
We must suffer for your fucking incapabilities 
And she could not see you destroy her 
I can't even grasp the pictures 
That you implanted in my mind 
My mind 
Must overcome and impale you with 
The epitomes of your actions 
We loved so much 
Now I won't let myself hate you less 
Now you're dead 
You haven't suffered enough 
I wish I could have been the one 
Who crushed your heart 
With my despaired hand letting 
Your unruly blood flow 
And your burned flesh lie collapsed 
Are you proud?",Why Father,1999
Walls of Jericho,"All hail the ones that take from life without giving back.
What's ours is ours.
Control is all you crave, a fucking paycheck is all you are.
Our world is crashing down before our fucking eyes.
We strive to be perfect in this imperfect world, so watch her starve herself.
Struggle to fit the mold, as she makes her self sick, it should make us all sick.
We can't go on like this, we can't go on like this.
Know your fucking role they say, as they die fighting beauty.
but they never knew that they were truly beautiful.
And we can't go on like this.
With our brainwashed minds, as they die fighting beauty.
because we're slaves to the system
We can't go on like this, let the dead be dead.
You corporate fuck, it's time to fight this.
The status quo, it's time to fight this.
Our broken families, it's time to fight this.
Your billboard barbie, it's time to fight this.
Let the dead be dead, all hail the dead.",All Hail the Dead,2004
Walls of Jericho,"Commit the compromise.
Restricts our rights the education society gives us.
You establish with your advertised tables.
What gives you our rights?
Laws shouldn't be put to what we read and hear.
Should nothing be said?
Shall we compromise?
No.
Our freedom, our rights, your mind.
Tear down the walls.
What can break must be broken.
You have proven, one person can omit regulations.
That can control our freedoms, our rights, and your fucking mind.",Day and a Thousand Years,2004
Walls of Jericho,"You can't imagine how much this fucking hurts.
How torn apart my mind has become.
I need to spare myself, from these endless tears.
I no longer want to look into the mirror.
I'm tired of being strong.
Do you ever feel so alone, your own existence goes unnoticed.
Yes, I'm talking about myself,
I'm not afraid to say I'm so tired of impressing you.
Have you ever rebelled against everything you believed, how fucked is that?
This needs to be for me I need to fix this broken, fix this broken heart.
One day rejection will be off my doorstep,
And your eyes will fill with the passion that pumps through my veins
And falls from my eyes. 
You are my demise.
And through it kisses my heart, I am still broken.",Fixing Broken Hearts,2004
Walls of Jericho,"So I shut my self down again, and wipe away my surroundings.
While the pain in my heart reminds me of time spent and forgotten.
Alone but capable to see through your shit,
I will bloom into what's unexpected of me,
Because your fucked up reality has driven me to this insanity.
How do you like me now?
That what I thought.
Disappear.
Melt into the cracks I created for you,
At least you can do is play the part, the one I wrote for you.
Now time is wasting, and I have ruined many makeup days on your behalf.
Another day will end, at least there's tomorrow",Jaded,2004
Walls of Jericho,"Let's not sugar coat this, it's not that sweet,
My mind restrains my lips from speaking those words no one wants to hear,
Those words someone has to say.
It's time to kiss goodbye.
I'm so close to ripping out my heart, I'm so close to throwing it in your face.
Where will I be then?
No better off than I am now.
Alone, afraid, desensitized.
This is not the first time and I'm sure its not the last.
This is the thing I am sure of, the one thing i know.
Let me ask you a question, do you know what's wrong with me?
Can you give me an answer?
If not then leave me the fuck alone, quit playing hero.
Honestly tears are not for you, these tears are for me.
The me inside of me, the one that no one sees, the me I strive to be.
I am so alone, and I'm afraid of becoming desensitized.
At least I think that's what I want.
Do you know what I want?
Do you know who I am?
Do you like who I've become?",A Little Piece of Me,2004
Walls of Jericho,"I remember those days, when we were screaming for change.
When it was more than just fashion and fame.
Our goals all seemed one and the same, and we sang the song of revolution.
The sky seemed endless there was no stopping us.
And i felt, we felt, like nothing could stand in our way.
And if i scream as loud as i can, it's got to fucking break,
We will raise our fists and fight for our own place.
All this time wishing our voices could be heard,
Now we finally have a voice and no one says a fucking word.
So let's scream as loud as we can and make it fucking break,
And let nothing stand in our way, stand in our way.",Revival Never Goes Out of Style,2004
Walls of Jericho,"A friendship slowly deteriorates.
A hand that pushes us apart.
I remember when you were the one, that i would turn to.
When nothing you had thought was wrong, we were the invincible ones.
Thanks for the memories now that you're gone.
What the fuck should i think when you let everything get in your way?
So much holds you down so much holds you back.
Are you the same?
Maybe I've changed.
Now we're stuck together, and our hatred grows stronger for each other.
And it tears me apart knowing you're fucked in the head,
And everything is all for you,
And fuck me for caring and sticking around.
Fuck you for holding me down.
We were the invincible ones.
What went wrong?",Thanks for the Memories,2004
Walls of Jericho,"The world been against you from day one
Tomorrows never promised, night has just begun
So sing with me we're all fucked
Cause this your hell and this is your heaven
Unlearn what you know burn all you've been give

I sing this song hoping that you still care
Cause we still care
That all the broken dreamers are living this nightmare

this was written when my heart and mind defined this contradiction
There was nothing I could have done those days play on and on
Now I cannot see what's written on your grave
I saw the white flag raised from miles away

I'm sorry for not being there
Twice in fucking one year

I sing this song hoping that you still care
Cause we still care
That all the broken dreamers are living this nightmare

you must have felt so alone
Terrifiedof a hollowed home
The only thing hopeless is death
Desperate hope made you cry out
Someone end the pain
The only thing hopeless is death



",And Hope to Die,2006
Walls of Jericho,"We must survive 

This is a wake up call 
To all who their eyes 
This is our hope, 
Hopeless beaten strife 

You kill the messenger not to hear it 
It doesn't mean it never happened 
It doesn't mean it never happened 

This is our mission statement to go show the world 
We must survive 

We've been dealt 
There's nothing left to chance 
And the ending of this story 
Is not filled with catchy hooks 
So save your 
It will all be o.k. anthems 
And it's not getting any better 
No it's not getting any better 

This is where we stand 
I hope you're ready to end this tragedy",The Haunted,2006
Walls of Jericho,"Your mechanical eyes show how empty you are inside
Night after night you walk through the door searching hoping, rotting and dying
What about this life keeps you going
Are you willing to kill this
One after another you line up to be seen
Hollow, wide eyed, drama queen
Are you willing to kill this cheap creep show

If you are looking for the time of your life you've got it
Searching, hoping and slowly rotting if you are looking for the time you've got it
All dolled up your selling and buying lies you buy their lies
Let's kill this cheap creep show

To all boys and girls with empty mouth and empty hands
What would you give to have it all to all the boys and girls what would you give to have it all
You've got look your best
Dress to impress if you're going to sell us the perfect image



",I Know Hollywood and You Ain't It,2006
Walls of Jericho,"Inside these broken lines
A disruption of our lives
Insanity kicks in and all I see
Is another dead end
So close your eyes
And escape from what you hide

how long will I take to bleed
There is no saving me
How far will you go to hold on?

I'm better off cutting my own throat
In hope for once that you might hear me
I know I can atleast count on the mess never judging me
I'm breaking out from all I've come to be

alone I've gone through hell
And back to try to feel
And there is no saving me



",No Saving Me,2006
Walls of Jericho,"A damage past is haunting me
Creeps in won't let me breathe
I can't quite grasp psychotic thoughts (and me) the troubles lie beneath
We won't back down its far too late
Paying the price of endeless pain our love, our hate
Which on will you embrace

now I can't pretend
To live this life of plastic happiness
This plastic happiness

because one chance is all we get to kill the questions in our minds
Just one more chance to turn around this life

break through the structure that we see
Reach true surrondings that we seek
And force the path we know is right
This won't conquer quietly
We won't back down its far too late
Paying the price of endeless pain our love, our hate

which on will you embrace

I'm so sad to say I've watched this tragedy take everything away from me
I write words for my own survival
If you don't hear them then they mean nothing at all

I won't live like this
In plastic happiness



",Plastic,2006
Walls of Jericho,"Your mechanical eyes show how empty you are inside
Night after night you walk through the door searching hoping, rotting and dying

",I Know Hollywood and You Aint It,2006
Walls of Jericho,"Do you forgive me?
You never lost your sight
So scream your heart out
To be damned one more TIME

This tragic, need for hope
Won't give up
It's what, keeps us alive
Now who will survive
In this game of chance
Now hold out your hand
And give me
This final kiss

If I load this gun, would you hold in your heart and give your life for love?

So bleed (SO BLEED)
This hate (THIS HATE)
With me
And fight these broken dreams

If I load this gun, would you give your life for love?

So bleed (SO BLEED)
This hate (THIS HATE)
With me
And fight these broken dreams!

This is more than hopeless romantics
I will never let it die
I walk the line
And your daybreak eyes
The whispers,
And the brand new scars
The brand new scars

Do you forgive me?
We will never let this die
We scream our hearts out
To be damned one more TIME

If I load this gun, could you hold it to your heart and give your life, your love?

So bleed,
This hate
With me
And fight these broken dreams

So bleed
This hate
And fight these broken dreams

If I load this gun will you hold it to your heart and give your life for love?

So bleed (SO BLEED)
This hate (THIS HATE)
With me
And fight these broken dreams
And fight these broken dreams

And fight
FIGHT
FIGHT
FIGHT
FIGHT

Wally Bryson,"Won't you let me get to know you?
Given the time I could show you
How good it feels to be in love
Nice to have someone thinking of you

If I had the chance with you
I'd ask for the last dance with you
We'd dance away into the night

Know that you shouldn't be sharing
All of those nights with your mother
Staring at you staring at her
Thinking of places you wish you were

If I had the chance with you
I'd ask for the last dance with you
We'd dance away into the night

Come on, dance
Come on, dance

Couldn't you give me a chance for a while?
Given the time I know I could make you smile

And once you let me get to know you
And give me the time and I'll show you
How good it feels to be in love
At night you'll have someone thinking of you

If I had the chance with you
I'd ask for the last dance with you
We'd dance away into the night

When I get my chance with you
I'll make enough romance for two

We'll sigh goodbye to all we ever had
Alone where we have walked together

I'll be content you loved me once in April
Your lips were warm and love and spring were new
I'm not afraid of autumn and her sorrow

For flames live such a little while

Wally Cox,"It's a grand night for singing,
The moon is flying high, 
And somewhere a bird 
Who is bound he'll be heard 
Is throwing his heart at the sky! 

It's a grand night for singing,
The stars are bright above.
The earth is a-glow
And to add to the show,
I think I am falling in love! 
Falling, falling in love.

It's a grand night for singing,
The moon is flying high,
And somewhere a bird
Who is bound he'll be heard,
Is throwing his heart at the sky!

Maybe it's more than the moon,
Maybe it's more than the birds,
Maybe it's more than sight of the night,
In a light too lovely for words. 

Maybe it's more than the earth
Shiny in silvery blue.
Maybe the reason I'm feeling this way
Has something to do with you!

Wally De Backer,"Pick apart
The pieces of your heart
And let me peer inside
Let me in
Where only your thoughts have been
Let me occupy your mind
As you do mine

You have lost
Too much love
To fear, doubt and distrust
Its not enough
You just threw away the key
To your heart

You don't get burned
'Cause nothing gets through
It makes it easier
Easier on you
But that much more difficult for me
To make you see

Love ain't fair
So there you are

You won't admit to it
It makes no sense
But I'm desperate to connect

Wally Fawkes,"'t was on the Isle of Capri that I found her 
Beneath the shade of an old walnut tree 
Oh, I can still see the flowers blooming round her 
Where we met on the Isle of Capri 

She was as sweet as a rose at the dawning 
But somehow fate hadn't meant her for me 
And though I sailed with the tide in the morning 
Still my heart's on the Isle of Capri 

Summertime was nearly over 
Blue Italian sky above 
I said ""Lady, I'm a rover, 
Can you spare a sweet word of love?""

And then as I kissed her hand I could see 
She wore a lovely meatball on her finger

And every stop that we made

There's a land that I've heard of once in a lullaby.
Somewhere over the rainbow, skies are blue

Really do come true.

And wake up where the clouds are far behind me.
Where troubles melt like lemon drops,
High above the chimney tops,
That's where you'll find me.

Why then, oh why can't I?
If happy little bluebirds fly beyond the rainbow
Why, oh why can't I?

Wally Lopez,"El perro donde esta el perro no se encuentra 
Cuidado que no se pierda allá el allá 
Y cuando está el perro no se sienta 
El perro no se acuesta está como sin estar 

Y no mueve la cola no obedece a nada y no 
Y no atiende a ordenes me mira y hace guau 

El perro donde esta el perro esta buscando 
A un amo que le entienda a un amo que le quiera 
Y no alguien que tan solo y simplemente 
Ultima últimamente el ese en mi ves tu 

Y no muevo la cola no me da la cara ya 
No atiendo a nada menos que no vuelvas 
A rascarme de tu mano así o a que a la idea de que 

Ey nunca tendrás nada ya tan bello ni mas 
Ey nunca llamas nadie ni tan pero jamas 

El perro donde está ha desaparecido 
Tan arduo quedo frío y menos ma' que 
Si cuando está le falta la cabeza 
Le chupas y lo besas así como muerto esta 

Y no mueve la cola no obedece a nada ya 
Atiende a poco siquiera que si le rasques 
Suavemente solo te mira a los ojos y recuerda que 

Ey nunca tendrás nada ya tan bello ni mas 
Ey nunca ya mas nadie ni tan bello jamas 
Ey nunca ya mas nadie ni tan bello jamas

And what insane and silly things we do
Here is what I see before me, vividly and clear
As I recall it, you were in it, too

I had the craziest dream last night, yes I did
I never dreamt it could be
Yet there you were, in love with me
I found your lips close to mine so I kissed you
And you didn't mind it at all

Then, please, say you do, Baby
Say it and make my craziest dream come true",I Had the Craziest Dream,1961
Wally Richardson,"Why am I sitting alone tonight,
when I could be out where the lights are bright?
It's all because of Jim, It's all because of Jim.
Why am i wasting these precios years?
Why am I crying these bitter tears?
It's all because of Jim, It's all because of Jim.

(Chorus):
Jim doesn't ever bring me pretty flowers,
Jim never tries to cheer my lonely hours,
Don't know why I'm so crazy for Jim.
Jim never tells me I'm his hearts desire.
I never seem to set his love afire
Gone are the years I've wasted on him.
Sometimes when I get feeling low,
I say ""Let's call it quits.""
Then I hang on and let him go
Breaking my heart in bits.
Some day I know tht Jim will up and leave me,
But even if he does you can believe me,
I'll go on carrying the torch for Jim.",Jim,1961

Wally Richardson,"A country dance was being held in a garden
I felt a bump and heard an ""Oh, beg your pardon""
Suddenly I saw polka dots and moonbeams
All around a pug-nosed dream

The music started and was I the perplexed one
I held my breath and said ""May I have the next one?""
In my frightened arms, polka dots and moonbeams
Sparkled on a pug-nosed dream

There were questions in the eyes of other dancers
As we floated over the floor
There were questions but my heart knew all the answers
And perhaps a few things more

Now in a cottage built of lilacs and laughter
I know the meaning of the words ""Ever after""
And I'll always see polka dots and moonbeams
When I kiss the pug-nosed dream",Polka Dots and Moonbeams,1961

So how can I sleep

They held each other tight as they drove on through the night they were so exited.

Walt Fowler,"There was a boy
A very strange enchanted boy
They say he wandered very far, very far
Over land and sea
A little shy and sad of eye
But very wise was he

And then one day
A magic day he passed my way
And while we spoke of many things
Fools and kings
This he said to me
""The greatest thing you'll ever learn
Is just to love and be loved in return""

Walt Gifford's New Yorkers,"It was down by old Joe's barroom, on the corner of the square
They were serving drinks as usual, and the usual crowd was there
On my left stood Big Joe McKennedy, and his eyes were bloodshot red
And he turned his face to the people, these were the very words he said

I was down to St. James infirmary, I saw my baby there
She was stretched out on a long white table, 
So sweet, cool and so fair

Let her go, let her go, God bless her
Wherever she may be
She may search this whole wide world over
Never find a sweeter man as me

When I die please bury me in my high top Stetson hat
Put a twenty dollar gold piece on my watch chain
The gang'll know I died standing pat

Let her go, let her go God bless her
Wherever she may be
She may search this wide world over
Never find a sweeter man as me

I want six crapshooters to be my pallbearers
Three pretty women to sing a song
Stick a jazz band on my hearse wagon
Raise hell as I stroll along

Let her go Let her go
God bless her
Wherever she may be
She may search this whole wide
World over
She'll never find a sweeter
Man as me",St. James Infirmary,1964

She's crying now. 
As he slides away. 
In sweets it charms. 
And led us all a bit astray. 
And so disarms. 
Brings peace to a world in decay. 
Shine.

And was his trust in love betrayed. 
She spurned allegiance far inside away. 
Leaned on friends who lived a lie. 
And hung on for the ride.

Told me love was too plebeian
Told me you were through with me

And now you say you love me

Walt Wagner,"The night is like a lovely tune
Beware my foolish heart
How white the ever constant moon
Take care my foolish heart

There's a line between love and fascination
That's hard to see, how many names such as this
For they both have the very same sensation
When you're locked in the magic of a kiss

Her lips are much too close to mine
Beware my foolish heart
But should our eager lips combine
Then let the fire start

For this time it isn't fascination
Or a dream that will fade and fall apart
It's love, this time it's love

I've found you, I've found you.

Strange music in my ears
Only now as you spoke, did it start.
Strange music of the sphere
Could its lovely hum be coming from my heart?
You appear and I hear song sublime
Song that I'm incapable of.
So Dear, let me hold you near
While we treasure every measure,
So that time can never change
The strange, new music of love.

Walt Weschler,"When an early autumn walks the land and chills the breeze
And touches with her hand the summer trees,
Perhaps you'll understand what memories I own.
There's a dance pavilion in the rain all shuttered down,

A winding country lane all russet brown,
A frosty window pane shows me a town grown lonely.
That spring of ours that started so April-hearted,
Seemed made for just a boy and girl.

I never dreamed, did you, any fall would come in view
So early, early.
Darling if you care, please, let me know,
I'll meet you anywhere, I miss you so.
Let's never have to share another early autumn.",Early Autumn,1999
Walt Weschler,"A country dance was being held in a garden
I felt a bump and heard an ""Oh, beg your pardon""
Suddenly I saw polka dots and moonbeams
All around a pug-nosed dream

The music started and was I the perplexed one
I held my breath and said ""May I have the next one?""
In my frightened arms, polka dots and moonbeams
Sparkled on a pug-nosed dream

There were questions in the eyes of other dancers
As we floated over the floor
There were questions but my heart knew all the answers
And perhaps a few things more

Now in a cottage built of lilacs and laughter
I know the meaning of the words ""Ever after""
And I'll always see polka dots and moonbeams
When I kiss the pug-nosed dream",Polka Dots and Moonbeams,1999

My disposition depends on you
I never mind the rain from the skies
If I can find the sun in your eyes
Sometimes I love you, sometimes I hate you
But when I hate you, it's 'cause I love you
That's how I am, so what can I do?
I'm happy when I'm with you

Sunbeams now there will be in the skies
Tell me that you will be true
That will all depend on you

Walter & The Dairy Kings Clevenger,"Listen everybody let me tell you 'bout the rock 'n' roll 
Feel that rhythm and it's really gonna thrill your soul 
She said come along with me, to a land of make believe 
She said rock 'n' roll is king

She loves that rock 'n' roll and she plays it all night long 
That's all she ever tells me when I call her on the telephone 
She says feel that jumpin' beat, and git up on your feet 
She says rock 'n' roll is king

Oh let those guitars play 
Play for me play for me 
Oh let that song ring out 
That's how it's meant to be

It rolls like a train that's comin' on down the track 
She rolled over Beethoven and she gave Tchaikovsky back 
She loves that drivin' beat, she goes dancin' on down the street 
She said rock 'n' roll is king

Oh let those guitars play 
Play for me play for me 
Oh let that song ring out 
That's how it's meant to be

When she comes around and I'm listenin' to the radio 
She says you can't do that 'cause all I wanna do is rock 'n' roll 
Now here I'm gonna stay where that music starts to play 
She says rock 'n' roll is king

I don't even have anyone to tell my story to

I'm pullin' in a picture now
Up off my back pages
And all at once am privy to
The entire grim design
Of a great civilization
In the terminal stages
Of a slow but steady mental moral spiritual decline
And so it goes
And thus it is written
And all I want to know is
Where does a guy like me fit in?

So I'm visualizing a cute little bunny
With a fluffy white tail and long grey floppy ears
Who looks up at me and says, Doc don't you worry
All you got to do is, hide in here
Now all you got to do is to just say when
You might consider bringing your sweetness 'round here again

The ones you left at home

Were you fit to swallow it
Or scared to clean your plate

Back in 1954 
When we moved up to Mount Savage 
As if it mattered anymore 
Mama always said 
How the air can clear her head 

We were colder and much higher 
Than we ever were before 
I recall her tailored jersey 
And the flowers that she wore 
Years ago I tried to tell her 
What was in my heart 
But she was part of the city

She took a little with sugar 
She took the money from my old man 
She took a little with sugar 
She took the money from my old man

I was taken with her showboat style 
But too young to understand 
She was all alone 
Ahead of her time 
She was first generation

Walter Becker,"Hunting in the Sea of Japan,
Ambrose left the tourist trail behind him.
So bold with his gun in his hand,
Of his furs there was no need to remind him.
Tripping over a Holy Man,
Mind that here you don't choose your friends,
Ambrose asked for a helping hand,
He heaved his chest, and pointed West,
To where the river runs.
With Josie back home on his mind,
Brushing off the fruit flies of the season,
And 'Brosie was surely struck blind,
By a sight that defies human reason:
On an island of gleaming rock,
Jutting up from the blue lagoon,
A ceremonial music box
And from it flowed, a bright new mode,
That made our hero swoon.
A finer minor from China.
The World when the traveler returned,
As you know played out its bloody romances.
But Ambrose he knew what he'd learned,
With his prize in hand he took his chances.
Soon the sound that delights the ear,
Blended in with the armies' roar.
When the warriors strained to hear,
This new bebop, this shooting star,
Their guns were bullet-full.
A finer minor from China.
A finer minor from China.

I can't complain about the pain and the heartache
The tears when your kisses disguise the lies 
My eyes don't see
And what do I need to know
As long as you go where I go
Wake up in the morning where the bad news can't find me
Walking in the sunshine with you right behind me
'Cause lazy living sure treats me right

I would move to another lifetime
I'd quit my job
Ride the train through the misty nighttime

Wherever I come down

Then they'll have me

Any world that I'm welcome to
Is better than the one I come from

I can hear your words
When you speak of what you are and have seen
I can see your hand

Where the days and nights are not the same
Captured happy in a picture frame

I got this thing inside me
That's got to find a place to hide me

Watch the children playing
Perhaps I'll find in my head
What my heart is saying

A kingdom where the sky is burning

Walter Becker,"I recall when I was small 
How I spent my days alone 
The busy world was not for me 
So I went and found my own 
I would climb the garden wall 
With a candle in my hand 
I'd hide inside a hall of rock and sand 
On the stone an ancient hand 
In a faded yellow-green 
Made alive a worldly wonder 
Often told but never seen 
Now and ever bound to labor 
On the sea and in the sky 
Every man and beast appeared 
A friend as real as I

Before the fall when they wrote it on the wall 
When there wasn't even any Hollywood 
They heard the call 
And they wrote it on the wall

Could be the very same 
A wooly man without a face 
And a beast without a name 
Nothin' here but history 
Can you see what has been done

Now I step into the sun

In our plot of frozen space he told his tale 

Poor man, he showed his hand
So righteous was his need 
And me so wise I bought his prize 
For chicken feed

Newfound cash soon begs to smash a state of mind 
Close inspection fast revealed his favorite kind 
Poor kid, he overdid
Embraced the spreading haze 

And while he sighed his body died 
In fifteen ways

When I heard I grabbed a cab to where he lay

On where she wants to be

The better is the enemy of the good
Don't'cha ask perfection of your trophy wife
Don't'cha take no chances with your trophy life, your trophy life

Do you remember the one
Remember the one in a million?
The one in a million affair
The one with the glorious prospects

Do you remember the shade
The shade of the sky which is burning?
Black was the shade in retreat
Blue was the color returning

Let's imagine some guy driving a coffee truck
Yet he dares to dream the impossible dream
Better have some answers for your trophy wife
Better not get cozy with your trophy life, your trophy life

Do you remember the face
The face of such graceful dimension?
The one that you wore in the world
It was such a lovely invention

Do you remember the name
Remember the name of the man?
The name of the man who tried hard
'Immemorious' was his name, oh",Do You Remember the Name,2008

Alsatian wine, playing records way past four
Making some crazy soulful love on the hard wood floor
Where did our love go?

You hung the picture of young Dizzy on the wall
According to me that was the best day of them all
Sweet, sweet words like honey from the tongue
Yes, there was magic then in every song we sung

Stand by the downtown canon, I say that it's got to be

Chasing sensation to remind us who we are
You met that half-crazed painter fool in some damn bar
Cocaine dreams and chiba-chiba nights
You had to share his world in shades of black and white
Did'nt'cha baby?

Yes, I, it's a real good theory, can you live with the day to day?
Sure thing, no problemo, sometimes it be that way
You go girl, it's now or never, no one holds out that long
Says here in the downtown canon keep it real, it'll be okay
Right here, the downtown canon, could it be any other way?

Packed up the Dylan and the Man Ray and the Joyce
I left a note that said, well, I guess I got no choice
Excuse me, girl, while I'm kickin' it to the curb
I'm leaving with all I need but less than I deserve

Slouched in a booth at Pamela’s Pistol Dawn

Up to the room with the beddie-bye goin’ on

You want to go where no man’s ever been
Down in the coal mine, goin' down
Turn around, push, push, turn around
Digging up the gold and carrying it back again

She looked good in the available light
She was somebody’s Saturday night
She said it ain’t wrong but it’s not quite right
I guess it's somebody's Saturday night

Somebody’s Saturday night says, hey, it's raining
You wouldn’t kick a good girl out on a night like this
He says, she says the demon in me says just you watch me
Pucker up, darling, for my legendary good night kiss

She’s no fool but she’s none too bright
She’s just somebody’s Saturday night
She stays cool if not watertight
Such is somebody’s Saturday night

Only a girl, one more is up and gone
Leaving nobody to blame the whole thing on, baby

Somebody’s Saturday night is walking in the moonlight
Playing on the beads of her beatnik Rosary
Thinking nobody gives it exactly the way that you want it
No one ever gets it with a money-back guarantee

But I've been born with the second sight
Now I’m looking in the mirror at somebody’s Saturday night
I get along, in fact I do all right

With a flame that burned so brightly in the sky
Then you woke up and your long white night was over
And you cursed the world that dared to pass you by

Dealing dirty while you steal the higher ground
But you cheated and you lied and life took you for a ride

Believing his own alibis

"Walter Bishop, Jr.","You know the feeling of something half remembered
Of something that never happened, yet you recall it well
You know the feeling of recognizing someone
That you've never met as far as you could tell, well

Laura is the face in the misty light
Footsteps that you hear down the hall
The laugh that floats on a summer night
That you can never quite recall
And you see Laura on the train that is passing through
Those eyes, how familiar they seem
She gave your very first kiss to you
That was Laura but she's only a dream",Laura,2012
"Walter Bishop, Jr.","When they begin the beguine
It brings back the sound of music so tender
It brings back a night of tropical splendor
It brings back a memory ever green

I'm with you once more under the stars
And down by the shore an orchestra's playing
And even the palms seem to be swaying
When they begin the beguine

To live it again is past all endeavor
Except when that tune clutches my heart
And there we are, swearing to love forever
And promising never, never to part

What moments divine, what rapture serene
Till clouds came along to disperse the joys we had tasted
And now when I hear people curse the chance that was wasted
I know but too well what they mean

So don't let them begin the beguine
Let the love that was once a fire remain an ember
Let it sleep like the dead desire I only remember
When they begin the beguine

Oh yes, let them begin the beguine, please make them play
Till the stars that were there before return above you
Till you whisper to me once more, ""Darling, I love you""

To a lullaby in ragtime.

By the way,
That they play,
As still, as the trill, of a thrush, in a twilight high.

So you can hear the
Rhythm of the ripples on the side of the boat,

As you sail away to dreamland.
High above the moon you hear a silvery note,
As the sandman takes your hand.

Don't you cry my baby,

Found the gold of superstition

And old shep was a pup
Over hills and meadows we'd stray
Just a boy and his dog
We were both full of fun
We grew up together that way

When I would have drowned beyond doubt
But old shep was right there
To the rescue he came
He jumped in and then pulled me out

As the years fast did roll
Old shep he grew old
His eyes were fast growing dim
And one day the doctor looked at me and said
I can do no more for him jim

With hands that were trembling
I picked up my gun
And aimed it at shep's faithful head
I just couldn't do it
I wanted to run
I wish they would shoot me instead

He came to my side
And looked up at me
And laid his old head on my knee
I had struck the best friend that a man ever had
I cried so I scarcely could see

for ol shep he knew he was going to go
for he reached down and licked at my hand
then he looked up at me just as much as to say
we're parting but i understand
