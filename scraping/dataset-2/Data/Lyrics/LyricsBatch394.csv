Jack Ingram,"This desert wind is burnin' my face again
God I'm missin' you
Been runnin' blind under a broken sky
With regrets I was sorting through
But lesson learned baby
I've made the turn

[Chorus]
Wherever you are
No matter how far
Girl I'm gonna find my way to you
Through rivers of rain
Over mountains of pain
Do whatever on earth I've gotta do
I'll follow the dream I'll follow my heart
Girl I've gotta be
Wherever you are

So many miles to where we said goodbye
To the street of shattered dreams
I'm prayin' hard you didn't start a life
With someone who's not me
And if you're just gone
Girl I'll be movin' on

[Chorus]

Let the sunrise find me searchin'
Let the west wind carry my plea
Give this changed man one more last chance
Open your arms to me

Wherever you are
Through rivers of rain
Over mountains of pain
Do whatever on earth I've gotta do
I'll follow the dream I'll follow my heart
Girl I've gotta be
Wherever you are
Wherever you are
Wherever you are
Wherever you are.",Wherever You Are,2006
Jack Ingram,"You know Dasher and Dancer
And Prancer and Vixen
Comet and Cupid
And Donner and Blitzen
But do you recall
The most famous reindeer of all

Rudolph, the red-nosed reindeer
Had a very shiny nose.
And if you ever saw him
You would even say it glows

All of the other reindeer
Used to laugh and call him names
They never let poor Rudolph
Play in any reindeer games

Then one foggy Christmas Eve
Santa came to say
""Rudolph with your nose so bright
Won't you guide my sleigh tonight?""

Then all the reindeer loved him
As they shouted out with glee
Rudolph the red-nosed reindeer
You'll go down in history!",Rudolph the Red Nosed Reindeer,2007
Jack Ingram,"I always believed and followed
Trusted in things, relied on faith
Faith let me down in hollow
Now, I have found another way

All I can do is what you want me to do, but I don't
And all I can say is what you want me to say, but I won't
All I can prove to you is I got nothing left to prove to you
Truth is that anything for you is all I can do

Everything is an empty promise
All that you say are lies to me
Silver and gold, shiny polish
It ain't worth anything if it ain't what you need

All I can do is what you want me to do, but I don't
All I can say is what you want me to say, but I won't
All I can prove to you is I got nothing left to prove to you
But at the end of every day, blinded by the truth
Anything for you is all I can do

It?s all I can do
It?s all I can do
It?s all I can do

All I can prove to you is I got nothing left to prove to you
But at the end of every day, blinded by the truth
Anything for you is all I can do

It?s all I can do
It?s all I can do
It?s all I can do

Jack Ingram,"Ava Adele, I already can tell
You are the one for me
Well, it hasn't been long
But I'm already way gone
In the eyes, Ava Adele

And I know that I
I ain't the first guy to take one look
At a beautiful girl and declare
That my search is through, I say this to you
I found love in Ava Adele

And I searched low and high
Never did find one thing worth dyin' for
But I'd fall to the ground
I'd go all the way down
Fightin', Ava Adele

And I know that I
I ain't the first guy to take one look
At a beautiful girl and declare
That my search is through, I say this to you
I found love in Ava Adele
Yeah, my search is through, I say this to you
I love you, Ava Adele

Jack Ingram,"I look around and all I see is people
Trying to find a reason
If this world can hand out such a beatin'
And they don't wanna hurt anymore

When we were young it all seemed to be easy
Everything within reach
One broken heart and we're retreatin'
'Cause we don't wanna hurt anymore

Don't want to, don't want to
Don't want to hurt anymore

But you look at me and you say you feel sorry
But you never understood
And you never knew the things I wanted
I just don't wanna hurt anymore

I keep trying to explain myself and figure
Why bother what's the use
I finally realized that all that matters is
I don't wanna hurt anymore

Don't want to, don't want to
Don't want to hurt anymore

I look around and all I see is people
Trying to find a reason
But this world hands out such a beatin'
And they don't wanna hurt anymore

Don't want to, don't want to
Don't want to hurt anymore

Don't want to, don't want to
Don't want to hurt anymore

Don't want to, don't want to
Don't want to hurt anymore

Jack Ingram,"We still listen to high school football
On the radio in West Texas
Lights to shine bright every Friday night
And you can drive ninety miles an hour
Down the highway straight to ' Cisco
The cops are at the ball game, they're getting tight

And the sky gets wider and wider
It disappear like the day
Into the great divide you fade away

And it's another world all together
Right in the middle of God's country
Smells like money, smells like shit
Yeah, it smells like hell

But when the cattle's all together
And the pump jacks all are moving
And the [cartons] are in blooming
It smells like nothing else

And the sky gets wider and wider
Just like a brand new day
Out in the great divide you fade away

It's the land of my people
My dream is come out here to find a bigger piece of sky
It's all the winners and all the losers
Real good people but just like you and I

Hey, but nothing's really changed much
As you drive on down at twenty
Mexicans still work out in the field

But everybody's dirty
Man they're all a bunch of gamblers
But some got rich
Yeah, but they're gamblers still

And the sky gets wider and wider
The day's gonna be your day
Out in the great divide you fade away

And it's the land of my people
My dream is come out here to find a bigger piece of sky
It's all the winners and all the losers
Real good people but just like you and I

We still listen to high school football
On the radio in West Texas
Lights to shine bright every Friday night

Jack Ingram,"I've been following your ghost
Running circles 'round this house
Tripping over memories
Trying to figure things out
It's been a few years and I miss you still
Get your picture on the window sill
Been thinking of ways, I got days to fill
I don't think I ever will

CHORUS
Hold on to things you can't explain
Hold on dancing in the rain
Hold on to kisses on the lips
Savor every sweet moment, cause baby this is it
And hold on
Hold on

I've been cleaning up this mess
Found a metal box with some black and white photographs
A little faded but baby you sure do look good in that old dress, oh yes
Didn't we wish we were superstars?
Sign our names in the dust on your family car
We'd be waving to the crowd
You be the diva
And I'll play guitar

CHORUS
Hold on to things you wanna be
Hold on to friends and family
Hold on to burning summer sun
It makes a difference, every one
Hold on
Hold on

Thinking that we'd say the same
But we didn't know that the world would change
Yeah it just keeps on spinning
And we just keep on holding on

Jack Ingram,"Honey, why you calling me so late?
It's kinda hard to talk right now
Honey, why are you crying, is everything okay?
I gotta whisper 'cause I can't be too loud

[Chorus]
Well, my girl's in the next room
Sometimes I wish she was you
I guess we never really moved on
It's really good to hear your voice saying my name
It sounds so sweet
Coming from the lips of an angel
Hearing those words - it makes me weak
And I never wanna say goodbye
But, girl, you make it hard to be faithful
With the lips of an angel

It's funny that you're calling me tonight
And, yes, I've dreamt of you too
And does he know you're talking to me?
Will it start a fight?
No, I don't think she has a clue

Dang this day

Jack Ingram,"Stare out at the horizon
Start the car and call the road your friend
Tell the girls and the Lord above
You'll think fondly and call back now and then

Head out of the city
Go find what they brought you down here for
Take that shiny penny
That daddy gave you from the day that you were born

And make a wish that dreams come true
Go on sail the ocean blue
Ride a highway like the wind
Drink the good times down like sin
Go on, take that car and drive so far
It looks like you're comin' home again

Stare at the moonlight
And threaten every star it won't be long
You tell 'em this is the very last night
I look to you to make sense of it all

Then head into the city
Electric lights that shine from dusk till dawn
Take that rusty penny
Throw it in the air and then move along

And make a wish that dreams come true
Go on sail the ocean blue
Ride a highway like the wind
Drink the good times down like sin
Go on, take that car and drive so far
It looks like you're comin' home again

You can't go back but you can't come back 'round
Let the world know as you roll through town

Make a wish that dreams come true
Go on sail the ocean blue
Ride a highway like the wind
Drink the good times down like sin
Go on, take that car and drive so far
It looks like you're comin' home again

Yeah, take that car and drive so far
It looks like you're comin' home again

Jack Ingram,"She slammed the screen door
Kicked up the dust pullin' out of here
Probably headed for Baton Rouge
Her tail lights just disappeared
I tried everything within my power to get her to stay
Guess all I can do right now is get on my knees and pray

[Chorus]
Maybe she'll get lonely
Maybe she'll turn that wheel around
Maybe she'll miss me
Before she hits the edge of town
'Cause I love her I need her
I can't live without her
Yeah the only hope that I've got left is
Maybe she'll get lonely

Right now she's angry
As mad as I've ever seen
And if she makes it a hundred miles
That means she's breakin' free
I think time is of the essence I keep ringin' her phone
It ain't lookin' too good right now before she's too far gone

Yeah I love her I need her
I miss her I want her

Jack Ingram,"When I was fifteen, I left home young
Tore up the tracks and then some
Me and my dad didn't see eye to eye
I never took to him, he never took the time
Bullet proof, more than tough
Smarter than he ever was

Well, I burned those wheels down the highway
And I learned what I learned the hard way
Do the best you can do, love many, trust few
Work hard for the money in your hands
That's the measure of a man
Yeah, the measure of a man

Anger burns, love cools it down
Pretty young woman turned my head around
The world through her eyes looked so different
She lives on faith, she looks for forgiveness
Fool proof, it ain't easy
I need her, she needs me

She stole my heart on this highway
She taught me to love through the hard days
Yeah, she's cool when I'm not; she's as steady as a rock
She's as solid as the ring on my hand
That's the measure of a man
Yeah, the measure of a man

Last night she handed me a son of my own
It killed me to do it, but I picked up the phone

Hey, Dad, I burned ten years down this highway
And I learned what I learned the hard way
Truth is, I need you; we'll cry if we need to
And I'll swallow my pride if you can

Oh yeah, the measure of a man.",Measure of a Man,2007

I'm blazing a trail to get her

And man shes lookin' strong
Mine all mine for the weekend

Or the grace God has given to me

It's free things I wouldn't trade for anything

Like the night we were standing
With your hand in my hand
Just staring up at the stars

Dancing to something
But it wasn't nothing
But the beating of two lucky hearts

The sound of a train
Hard pouring rain
And the words that you whispered to me

Oh free things I wouldn't trade for anything
Are everything
Free things I wouldn't trade for anything
Are everything to me

Jack Ingram,"Saw a story on the local news last night
About one more struggling single mother
She was talking about how hard it is getting by
With no help, no money, no nothing from the baby's father
Made me think about this guy I know with a wife and a child
Who's working two jobs just to get by
Yeah, he says he'd do anything he could in this world
Just to give his young family a better life; yeah, a better life

Oh, that's a man
That's a 19-year-old, modern-day hero man

Those two young marines over there fighting for their country
Man, they're gonna be friends forever
They've both come back eventually
But as bonds and destiny would have it
They don't come back together
Yeah, the one who lived to tell about it
Why he can't even talk about it
Keeps fighting that fight up there in his head
Ain't a day goes by he don't wonder why
Why it wasn't me instead
It could've been me instead

Oh, that's a man
That's a you don't know how hard he tried to save his buddy's life man

I don't know about you
But sometimes, I just need a little reminder
When I've been walking through this world
With blinders on, yes I have
You know it'd never hurt a man
To try and be a better man
And reach down and find some understanding
Find some kind of kindness

Read about a man who said his family
Had been farming the same land in Ohio for 100 years
Felt like he'd paid for it ten times over
With his own blood, his own sweat, and his own tears

Jack Ingram,"From thirty thousand feet above the desert floor I see it there below 
A city with a legend, the West Texas city of El Paso 
Where long ago I heard a song about a Texas cowboy and a girl 
And a little place called Rosa's where he used to go and watch this beauty whirl 

I don't recall who sang the song but I recall a story that I heard 
And as I look down on this city I remember each and every word 
The singer sang about a jealous cowboy and the way he used a gun 
To kill another cowboy, then he had to leave El Paso on the run 

El Paso City 
By the Rio Grande 
The cowboy lived and rode away but love was strong he couldn't stay 
He rode back just to die in that El Paso sand 
El Paso City 
By the Rio Grande 
I try not to let you cross my mind but still I find
There's such a mystery in the song that I don't understand 

My mind is down there somewhere as I fly above the badlands of New Mexico 
I can't explain why I should know the very trail he rode back to El Paso 
Can it be that man can disappear from life and live another time 
And does the mystery deepen 'cause you think that you yourself lived in that other time 

Somewhere in my deepest thoughts familiar scenes and memories unfold 
These wild and unexplained emotions that I've had so long, but I have never told 
Like everytime I fly up through the heavens and I see you there below 
I get the feeling sometime in another world I lived in El Paso 

El Paso City 
By the Rio Grande 
Could it be that I could be the cowboy in the mystery 
That died there in that desert sand so long ago 
El Paso City 
By the Rio Grande 
A voice tells me to go and seek, another voice keeps telling me 
Maybe death awaits me in El Paso

Dreaming of a song

Haunts my reverie

And each kiss an inspiration

Of paradise, where roses grew

Above thy deep and dreamless sleep
The silent stars go by
Yet in thy dark streets shineth

Are met in thee tonight

And gathered all above
While mortals sleep, the angels keep
Their watch of wondering love
O morning stars together
Proclaim the holy birth
And praises sing to God the King
And Peace to men on earth

No crib for a bed

Lay down His sweet head
The stars in the sky
Look down where He lay

Cast out our sin and enter in
Be born to us today

The great glad tidings tell
O come to us, abide with us

Has brought my lover to me

And never sleep in bed

And to my greatest joy, my love is there

On the ceiling near my bed
In my sight
Through the night

I try to hide in vain
Underneath my counterpane
But there's my love
Up above

I whisper, ""Go away, my lover
It's not fair""

He's still there

Since it is a dancing floor
Just for my love",Dancing on the Ceiling,2007

Jack Jezzro,"Frosty the snowman was a jolly happy soul
With a corncob pipe and a button nose
And two eyes made out of coal

Frost the snowman is a fairy tale they say
He was made of snow but the children know
How he came to life one day

There must have been some magic
In that old silk hat they found
For when they placed it on his head
He began to dance around

Frosty the snowman was alive as he could be
And the children say he could laugh and play
Just the same as you and me, come on

Thumpety thump thump, thumpety thump thump
Look at Frosty go
Thumpety thump thump, thumpety thump thump
Over the hills of snow

Thumpety thump thump, thumpety thump thump
Look at Frosty go
Thumpety thump thump, thumpety thump thump
Over the hills of snow

Oh, Frosty the snowman knew the sun was hot that day
So he said, ""Let's run and we'll have some fun
Now before I melt away""

Down to the village with a broomstick in his hand
Running here and there, all around the square
Sayin', ""Catch me if you can""

He led them down the streets of town
Right to the traffic cop
And he only paused a moment
When he heard him holler, ""stop""

Hey, Frosty the snowman had to hurry on his way
But he waved goodbye, sayin', ""don't you cry
I'll be back again someday""

Thumpety thump thump, thumpety thump thump
Look at Frosty go
Thumpety thump thump, thumpety thump thump
Over the hills of snow

He'll be back, yes he will, again someday
See you next year Frosty

Jack Johnson,"Saturday morning and it's time to go
One day these could be the days but who could have known
Loading in the back of a pickup truck
Riding with the boys and pushing the luck
Singing songs loud on the way to the game
Wishing all the things could still be the same
Chinese home runs over the backstop
Kakua on the ball and soda pop well

We used to laugh a lot
But only because we thought
That everything good always would remain
Nothing's gonna change there's no need to complain

Sunday morning and it's time to go
Been raining all night so everybody knows
Over to the field for tackle football
Big hits, big hats, yeah give me the ball
Rain is pouring, touchdown scoring
Keep on rolling, never boring
Karma, karma, karma chameleon
We're talking kinda funny from helium

We used to laugh a lot
But only because we thought
That everything good always would remain
Nothing's gonna change there's no need to complain

Monday morning and it's time to go
Wet trunks and schoolbooks and sand on my toes
Do anything you can to dodge the bus-stop blues
Like driving a padiddle with a burnt-out fuse
Well, my best friend Kimi wants to go with you
So meet her by the sugar mill after school
My best friend Kimi wants to go with you
Meet her by the sugar mill after school

Because every time he's rejected man he loses affection

How many years and you've barely even tasted
Anything remotely close to
Everything you've boasted about

Incoming tide touches roots to expose them

A piece of the pie
Make a fool of his system
Make a fool of his mind
Give him bottles of lies

His place in heaven

And the heat was more than hungry
And the cars were square and spitting
Diesel fumes

The bulls were running wild
Because they're big and mean and sacred
And the children were playing cricket with no shoes

The next morning we woke up, man
With a seven-hour drive
Well there we were stuck in Port Blair
Where boats break and children stare

And there were so many fewer questions
When stars were still just the holes to heaven
And there were so many fewer questions
When stars were still just the holes to heaven

Disembarking from the port
With no mistakes of any sort
Moving south the engine running smooth

Officials were quite friendly
Once we drowned them with our sweet talk
And we bribed them with our cigarettes and booze

The next morning we woke up man
With the sunrise to right
Moving back north to Port Blair
Where boats break and children stare

And there were so many fewer questions
When stars were still just the holes to heaven

The children's laughter sang 
And skipping just like the stones they threw 
Their voices echoed across the waves 
It's getting late 

And it was just another night 
With a sunset and a moonrise 
Not too far behind to give us just enough light 
To lay down underneath the stars 
We listened to Papa's translations 
Of the stories across the sky 
We drew our own constellations 

The west winds often last too long 
And when they calm down, nothing ever feels the same 
Sheltered under the Kamani tree 
Waiting for the passing rain 
Clouds keep moving to uncover the sea 
Stars up above us chasing the day away

Listen close enough and all else fades

I come over early in the morning
I'm like a heat wave, without warning
And when I touch you my heart begins to flutter

Girl I wanna lay you down
I said girl I wanna lay you down 



I'm gonna flood you, like a love river
Awe baby the post man, is about to deliver
Cook you up some dinner, a little pasta
Listen to some music, a little Rasta

I said girl I wanna lay you down, 
I said girl I wanna lay you down,
(Girl I wanna lay you down)
Aww baby baby
Don't you no I need your love!

So turn out the lights, bring out the candles,
Wrap your arms around my love handles,
They say the passion may not always endure,
But this feeling that I have for you is burning up my world

It's too early don't pick it up

We got everything we need right here

No song that I could sing, but I can try for your heart
Our dreams, and they are made out of real things
Like a, shoe box of photographs
With sepia-toned loving
Love is the answer, at least for most of the questions in my heart
Like why are we here? And where do we go?
And how come it's so hard?
It's not always easy and
Sometimes life can be deceiving
I'll tell you one thing, it's always better when we're together

It's always better when we're together
Yeah, we'll look at the stars when we're together
Well, it's always better when we're together
Yeah, it's always better when we're together

And all of these moments
Just might find their way into my dreams tonight
But I know that they'll be gone
When the morning light sings
And brings new things
For tomorrow night you see
That they'll be gone too
Too many things I have to do
But if all of these dreams might find their way
Into my day to day scene
I'd be under the impression
I was somewhere in between
With only two
Just me and you
Not so many things we got to do
Or places we got to be
We'll sit beneath the mango tree now

Yeah, it's always better when we're together
We're somewhere in between together
Well, it's always better when we're together

They look so, so pretty when I sleep
Hey now, and when I wake up,

Will it ever stop?
How will this all play out?

By now we should know how to communicate instead of coming to blows
We're on the road and there ain't no stopping us now
We're burning under control
Isn't it strange how we're all burning
Under the same sun
By now they say if it's a war for peace
It's the same old game
But do we really want to blame?
We could close our eyes it's still there
We could say it's us against them
We could try but nobody wins
Gravity has got a hold on us all
We could try to put it out
But it's a growing flame
Using fear as fuel
Burning down our name
And it won't take too long
Cause words are burned the same
Then who are we gonna blame
Now and all

It's such a crying, crying, crying shame
It's such a crying, crying, crying shame
It's such a crying, crying, crying shame

By now it's beginning to show
A number of people their numbers that ain't coming home
I could close my eyes it's still there
Close my mind, be alone
I could close my heart and not care
But gravity has got a hold on us all
It's a terrific price to pay
But in the true sense of the word
Are we using what we've learned
In the true sense of the word
Are we losing what we were

It's such a tight game
Will it ever stop?
It's not for me to say
And is it in our blood?
Or is it just our fate?
And how will this all play out?

I sure do, it was some time in early September
You were lazy about it, you made me wait around
I was so crazy about you I didn't mind

So I was late for class, I locked my bike to yours
It wasn't hard to find, you painted flowers on it
I guess that I was afraid that if you rolled away
You might not roll back my direction real soon

Well I was crazy about you then and now
The craziest thing of all is over ten years have gone by
And you're still mine, we're locked in time
Let's rewind

Do you remember when we first moved in together?
The piano took up the living room
You played me boogie-woogie I played you love songs
You'd say we're playing house now you still say we are

We built our getaway up in a tree we found
We felt so far away but we were still in town
Now I remember watching that old tree burn down
I took a picture that I don't like to look at

With the people keeping calling for the metaphors
But, don't leave much up to the imagination
So I want to give this imagery back
But I know it ain't just so easy like that
So, I turn the page and read the story again and again and again
Sure seems the same with a different name
We're breaking and rebuilding, and we're growing always guessin'

Never knowing shocking but we're nothing
We're just moments
We're clever but we're clueless
We're just human
Amusing and confusing
We're tryin' but where is this all leading
We'll never know

It all happens so much faster
Than you can say a disaster
Want to take a time lapse and look at it back
We found the last one but maybe that's just the answer
That we're after but after all
We're just a bubble in a boiling pot
Just one breath in a chain of thought
The moment's just combusting
Feels certain but we'll never never know
Sure seems the same give it a different name
We're begging, and we're needing and we're trying and we're breathing

And you can either sink or swim

It's got no feeling so we'll read it again and again and again

Well I can't believe that my lime tree is dead
I thought it was sleeping
I guess it got fed up with not being fed
And I would be too, I need food in my belly and hope that my time isn't soon

So I, try, to understand, what I can't hold in my hand, and where ever we are
Home is there too
And if you, could try to find it too,
Cause this place is overgrown into with works in bloom
Home is wherever we are, if there's love there too

In the back of our house there's a trail that won't end
We were walking so far that it grew back in
There's no trail at all,only grass growing tall
Get out my machete and battle with time once again
But I'm bound to lose because I'll be damned if time don't win

I gotta get home theirs a garden to tend, all the seeds from the fruit buried again
There own family trees teach them thank you and please as they spread their own roots they watch their young fruit grow again
And this old trail will lead me right back to where it begins

So I, try to understand, what I can't hold in my hand

That they have to choose pushing for peace supporting the troops
And either you're weak or you'll use brut force-feed the truth
The truth is we say not as we do

We say anytime, anywhere, just show your teeth and strike the fear
Of god wears camouflage, cries at night and drives a dodge
Pick up the beat and stop hogging the feast
That's no way to treat an enemy

Well mighty mighty appetite
We just eat 'em up and keep on driving
Freedom can be freezing take a picture from the pretty side
Mind your manners wave your banners
What a wonderful world that this angle can see

Who needs please when we've got guns?
Who needs keys when we've got clubs?
Who needs peace when we've gone above

And if you ever saw it
You might even say it glows

Used to laugh and call him names
They never let poor Rudolph
Join in any reindeer games

But then one foggy Christmas Eve
Santa, he came to say
Rudolph with your nose so bright
Won't you guide my sleigh tonight?

Then how the reindeers loved him
As they shouted out with glee
Rudolph the red nosed reindeer
You'll go down in history

But Rudolph, he didn't go for that
He said, I see through your silly games
How can you look me in the face
When only yesterday, you called me names?

Stuck between channels my thoughts all quit
I thought about them too much, allowed them to touch
The feelings that rained down on the plains all dried and cracked
Waiting for things that never came

Shock and awful thing to make somebody think
That they have to choose pushing for peace supporting the troops
And either you're weak or you'll use brut force-feed the truth
The truth is we say not as we do

We say anytime, anywhere, just show your teeth and strike the fear
Of god wears camouflage, cries at night and drives a dodge
Pick up the beat and stop hogging the feast
That's no way to treat an enemy

Well mighty mighty appetite
We just eat 'em up and keep on driving
Freedom can be freezing take a picture from the pretty side
Mind your manners wave your banners
What a wonderful world that this angle can see

But who needs to see what we've done?
Who needs please when we've got guns?
Who needs keys when we've got clubs?
Who needs peace when we've gone above
But beyond where we should have gone?
Beyond where we should have gone
We went beyond where we should have gone
Beyond where we should have gone","Sleep Through the Static [Paris, France]",2009

Jack Johnson,"As I was saying
Just before you left the room
Before I assumed
That you might not come around

As I was saying
Just after I took my foot from
My mouth and put it back
On the ground

I don't want to disappoint you
I don't want to disappear
From here or now or you

This is worth saving
Because the sum of us is more than us
If you add us up
Then subtract my lack of sleep

My mind feels crazy
When all these thoughts come rushing in
Should I be trusting them
Or only let them be?

I don't want to disappoint you
I don't want to disappear
From here or now or you

Is it just a matter of time?
Does it even matter at all?
Because even if this story should fall
From the sky to the sea
If I should fall
Would you fall down with me?
Would you fall down with me?

Found my foundation
It was underneath me all along
On this path I'm on,
Now I never walk alone

I've been erasing
Rewrote the second half like this
So my protagonist
Might find his way back home

I don't want to disappear

Well they're only on one side of the coin

All these changes

I tried to play it cool and attached no strings

When all I want is you

It feels good to be the one, that you want
When all I want is you

You see I knew right then, that this could last so long
I went home that night, I wrote my first love song
And as the days went by, I knew I had it made
Well you could try to pretend, your smile gave it away

It feels good to be the one, that you want
When all I want is you

Jack Johnson,"There's a black hole pulling me in
I slowly bend till I see the back of my own sins
I stole my soul from myself now I wonder

Wonder, is there somebody with a perfect plan
That goes boom when it's stamped and we could understand
How the gods of old used to clap their hands to make thunder

So we're clapping and we're laughing like it was so absurd
In the future we'll be laughing at who we were right now
As man plays god with the land that he plunders

To the one unknown no one can know nor see
That's resistant to greed
If we listen to time after time, time can never go under

There's this vine trying to climb
Through the window into my life
I don't mind
I don't mind
I don't mind
There's this wine trying to find
It's way from the bottle into my mind
In my mind
In my mind
In my mind

And so this vine is trying to climb
Through the window into my life
To bring me symmetry
And memories of a backlit breeze
Back into a dream on the ground
Looking up at the sun coming down

Into a world of boys and girls
Are holding handheld devices
While they're eating and they're sleeping
And they're dreaming of the prices
We'll be paying down the line
When the ice melts maybe it will turn to wine

And all the greatest of the heroes started jumping from the books
They started wearing ones and zeros
Looking more and more like crooks
They stole the sunlight from the future
Took a sip, drained half the glass, and put it back

And a lot of people like to have a feast
Not so many could stomach the killing
Lot of traffic on the streets, so who's really doing all the drilling
Keep on filling what can never be full
My imagination has got a hold on me

There's this vine trying to climb
Through the window into my life
I don't mind
I don't mind
I don't mind
There's this wine trying to find
It's way from the bottle into my mind

Jack Johnson,"I was tired of my lady, we'd been together too long.
Like a worn-out recording, of a favorite song.
So while she lay there sleeping, I read the paper in bed.
And in the personals column, there was this letter I read:

""If you like Pina Coladas, and getting caught in the rain.
If you're not into yoga, if you have half-a-brain.
If you like making love at midnight, in the dunes of the cape.
I'm the lady you've looked for, write to me, and escape.""

I didn't think about my lady, I know that sounds kind of mean.
But me and my old lady, had fallen into the same old dull routine.
So I wrote to the paper, took out a personal ad.
And though I'm nobody's poet, I thought it wasn't half-bad.

""Yes, I like Pina Coladas, and getting caught in the rain.
I'm not much into health food, I am into champagne.
I've got to meet you by tomorrow noon, and cut through all this red tape.
At a bar called O'Malley's, where we'll plan our escape.""

So I waited with high hopes, then she walked in the place.
I knew her smile in an instant, I knew the curve of her face.
It was my own lovely lady, and she said, ""Oh, it's you.""
And we laughed for a moment, and I said, ""I never knew"".

""That you liked Pina Coladas, and getting caught in the rain.
And the feel of the ocean, and the taste of champagne.
If you like making love at midnight, in the dunes of the cape.
You're the love that I've looked for, come with me, and escape.""

So I sank down deep
No I'm drunken like a seasick dream
In this dream, I am awake

Roll right in and make me their slave
So I went so far away

The setting sun with every turn
Above the ground the oak trees burn
And then we foray

A coffee cup, a deck of cards

A little room where all the roses bloom
I want to lead you into Nature's hall
Where ev'ry year the roses give a ball
They have an orchestra up in the trees
For their musicians are the birds and bees
And they will sing us a song
As we are strolling along
 
In sunny Roseland, where summer breezes are playing
Where the honey bees are ""A-Maying""
There all the roses are swaying
Dancing while the meadow brook flows
The moon when shining is more than ever designing
For 'tis ever then I am pining
Pining to be sweetly reclining
Somewhere in Roseland
Beside a beautiful rose
 
The ball is over and tulips meet
Their little kisses are so short and sweet
The lilies nod to the forget-me-nots
When they're departing in their flower pots
But all the roses with their spirits high
Remain to love until they droop and die
And dear, why shouldn't it be
Just so with you and with me
 
In sunny Roseland, where summer breezes are playing
Where the honey bees are ""A-Maying""

Just like I love him (just like I love him)
I want you to do (I want you to do)
Just the same for him (just the same for him, yeah)

You ain't know who Jacob was so I showed you twice

Without my nigga on the passenger side?

Finish the race, holdin' my crown high (take that)
I fly next to God, my eyes on the prize
Been away a long time but now I'm re-energized

Using my soap, laying up in my pool
Walking around in his boxers, like every thing's cool
Gassing my chick for the whip, dropping her off at school
Under my covers and changing my channels
Playing my CD's in my robes, another man's burning my candles
My cologne's half way gone, a fake don, my wiz fell for
Now she strolls the park under his arm
This is my fault, I've never thought I'd see this coming
From the outside bugging, with crazy knots in my stomach
Say what goes around, comes around, now I know it now
Now I'm the fool looking in while it's going down
If somebody would of told me, I might be lonely
Now it's on me, baby call me please

That 'posed to be me, but I was too stupid and stubborn
Like a piece of rope, I let it go, my mother said it so
You better straighten up, don't act like you didn't know
Her birthday came, heard she was hugged up, wearing his chain
Play in the sky box, at some bullshit Knick game
My son said, daddy, he like his eggs well done
And he kinda cool, mommy happy, I can't front
He take us on trips and clothes shopping, most of the time
We watch flicks on your surround sound, he watch boxing
You better go beg or something, before she go love him
He's taking your spot, 'cause you was dissing mommy, you bugging
They don't argue, he sent her flowers for no reason
She's cheesing, I'm wishing you could come back and see this

Jack Ladder and the Dreamlanders,"If you take me I’ll take you
It’s all so simple I spent so long being fooled
I’m going to hold you ‘til the end
And you have to hold me too 
But you don’t need to pretend

That it’s real, so real
And it’s true, yeah it’s true  
I’ve tried every option 
Crawled through hell just to get to you

To keep and to be kept

To make a promise doesn’t cost a thing
And if you break your word you risk 
Losing everything
Me, I’ve always been a country of one
Since we met border control’s all come undone

What you see is what I see
What you feel is what I feel
Every night we share 
I’m more settled on the deal

To keep and to be kept
When all you give is all you get

What if you say ‘wait’ 
I’ll wait
If you say ‘go’  
I’ll say ‘no’
I’m through with picking locks
Now it’s you that I call home

Jack Lathrop,"In a little honky-tonky village in Texas 
There's a guy who plays the best piano by far 
He can play piano any way that you like it 
But the way he likes it best is eight to the bar 
When he plays it's a ball 
He is the daddy of them all... 
The people gather round when he gets on the stand 
Then when he plays he gets a hand 
The rhythm he beats puts the cats in a trance 
Nobody there bothers to dance 
And when he jams with the bass and guitar 
They holler all, ""Beat me daddy, eight to bar!""

Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb
Always reminding me that we're apart
You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms

Of paradise, where roses grew

In my heart it will remain

Jack McDuff,"Sometimes the world is a valley of heartaches and tears
And in the hustle and bustle, no sunshine appears
But you and I have our love always there to remind us
There is a way we can leave all the shadows behind us
Volare, oh, oh! Cantare, oh, oh, oh, oh!
Let's fly way up to the clouds, away from the maddening crowds
We can sing in the glow of a star that I know of
Where lovers enjoy peace of mind
Let us leave the confusion and all disillusion behind
Just like birds of a feather a rainbow together we'll find

Like a nightingale without a song to sing
Oh, why should I have Spring fever
When it isn't even spring?

I keep wishing I were somewhere else
Walking down a strange new street
Hearing words that I have never heard
From a girl I've yet to meet

I'm as busy as a spider spinning daydreams
I'm as giddy as a baby on a swing

Told me love was too plebeian
Told me you were through with me

Jack McVea,"[Grym Reaper]
I want a queen on every continent
So I can escape the government
Flee my residence, settle in
I'm militant minded, brilliant rhyme whiz
The time is now for me to shine, kids are innocent
Blinded, society got to be reminded of my diary
Cause tragically I carry thee
Misery of centuries that's sent to me
Not coincidentally intentionally cause mentally I represent the key
But it's a double-edged sword see
Tryin to be godly is hard
Especially in poverty's backyard
Where violence has taken over
Free enterprise and lies is idolized
Cause it's deep inside with Allah, God or Jehovah
To guide the lost tribe
You're forced to reside on the north side
Babylon is never penalized
For bein offsides, so many lost lives
I wonder how long before the herd dies
Today I heard the earth cry for the first time
It was the worst time
It was the worst time
The way I heard the earth cry

[Rzarector]
I came to the shores of America disguised as a pillar
The alpha and omega and the home of the beggars, the black sellers
Who been beaten, raped, lynched, robbed and stoned
And caused to roam the earth in service cause they couldn't maintain at 
home
This dates back to 1555
When they captured the first tribe of men
And piled them in a pen
Fifty feet high
They took em all on a 9000 mile ride
And landed on the shore of a place they never seen before
But read about this inside the ancient books of war
Bonded in stainless steel, stripped of their language
Still survived the anguish of slavery but still remained nameless
Separated to portions and tricked by John Haughty Hawkins
And sold on the auction, taught birth control and abortion
Rulers of the first part became slaves of the worst part
The devils cursed God and reversed God
And turned God into dog and made people search hard
No relief came to the prophet of W.D. Feraud
To a trauma, dropped our mommas off in Bahamas and Barbados
Tobagos, separated us from slave boats
Made our own brothers hate us
From Virgin Isle to Jamaica
Trinidad, Honduras, Haiti, Grenada
Bermuda to Cayman, mental enslavement
You black gods become awaken

At night time you can hear the earth cry
How many more black gods got to die
Before we realize there's no God in the sky
The devil tricked us, that's the worst lie
At night time I can hear the earth cry
How many more black gods got to die
You realize there's no God in the sky
The devils tricked us, that's the worst lie

[Gatekeeper]
Peace god for real, not a spook nor a ghost
Not unseen but seen and heard most of all
I'm god, control nine planets
Wisdom revolves around me understand it
Science, huh my rhyme's underrated
Pyramids built accordin to how we made it to be
Many shall come few shall be chosen
32 degrees below zero and you're frozen
Power of refinement my rhyme's assignment
Is to crush negative bullshit in a line
With the fusion
Cause that which is beyond 360 degrees is an illusion
Either you're deaf, dumb or blind
Stupid hypocritical, dumb 85 yo it's time
See I without me don't exist
God cypher love devine is what I miss
Check it like a visual reflection, sorta supernatural
Your know your mind detects as bein natural
Ultra gammer, the hammer's my energy
Compressed to a form of a threat toward my enemy
Cypher's a circle that consists of a whole
No beginning no ends no sides it's just a hole
Like in an event I'm a percent
Dealt out a hundred I'm 5, my degree is a black belt
Real genuine not authentic
Older than the sun moon and stars unprecedented
In North America success can be won as a game
And knowledge and understanding still one and the same
Greatest reward known to mankind
That winners never quit and quitters never win in the mind
But in time my degrees are gettin deeper
Thicker in the subconscious state of the sleeper

At night time I can hear the earth cry
Wonder how many black gods got to die
At night time I can hear the earth cry
I wonder how many black gods must die
At night time I can hear the earth cry
I wonder how many black gods must die
At night time I can hear the earth cry
I hear her cry (Peace to the earth)

Behold your King! Before him lowly bend!

His law is love and His gospel is peace.
Chains he shall break, for the slave is our brother.
And in his name all oppression shall cease.

The sweet fulfillment of their secret longing

She get so she don't love me, love nobody else

Sure as that spider hangin' on the wall
Sure as that spider hangin' on the wall
I advised that old cherry ball, ""Keep fallin' on call""

I'll catch the Southern if you take the Santa Fe
I'll take the Southern and if you'll take the Santa Fe
I'm gonna ride and ramble, tell cherry to come back to me",Cherry Ball Blues,
Jack Owens,"Stars shining bright above you
Night breezes seem to whisper ""I love you""
Birds singing in the sycamore tree
Dream a little dream of me

Say ""Night-ie night"" and kiss me
Just hold me tight and tell me you'll miss me
While I'm alone and blue as can be
Dream a little dream of me

Stars fading, but I linger on, dear
Still craving your kiss
I'm longing to linger till dawn, dear
Just saying this

Sweet dreams till sunbeams find you
Sweet dreams that leave all worries behind you
But in your dreams whatever they be
Dream a little dream of me

Stars fading, but I linger on, dear
Still craving your kiss
I'm longing to linger till dawn, dear
Just saying this

Sweet dreams till sunbeams find you
Sweet dreams that leave all worries far behind you
But in your dreams whatever they be
Dream a little dream of me",Dream a Little Dream of Me,2006

If you decide to say goodbye
You're gonna make my poor heart cry
Oh,what, what what can it be
But time will tell if you'll be true
Or if you gonna leave me blue
So I'll just wait-ait and see
If you never gonna kiss me again
And you never hug me again
Oh, oh
What will I do
Oh my dear, I really try
When you're out with another guy
But I can't help feeling sad
This hurt I have within my heart
Is there because you want to part
Why must you treat me bad
Why do you want to leave
You make my poor heart grieve
Oh, oh
What will I do
And if you do remain
You'll set me heart a flame
Sure as the stars above
You are the one I love
Oh my dear I really try
When you're out with another guy
But I can't help feeling sad
This hurt I have within my heart
Is there because you want to part
Why must you treat me bad
Why do you want to leave
You make my poor heart grieve
Oh, oh
What will I do

Jack Palmer,"I have to drive
I have my reasons, dear
It's cold outside
I hate the seasons here

I suffer mornings most of all
I feel so powerless and small
By ten o'clock I'm back in bed
Fighting the jury in my head

You learn to drive
It's only natural, dear
You drive all night
We haven't slept in years

We suffer mornings most of all
We saw you lying in the road
We tried to dig a decent grave
But it's still no way to behave

It is a delicate position
Spin the bottle
Pick the victim
Catch a tiger
Switch directions
If he hollers
Break his ankles
To protect him

We'll have to drive
They're getting closer
Just get inside
It's almost over

We will save your brothers
We will save your cousins
We will drive them far away
From streets and lights
From all signs of bad mankind

We suffer mornings most of all
Wake up all bleary eyed and sore
Forgetting everything we saw

(I'll meet you in an hour
At the car)",Have to Drive,2008
