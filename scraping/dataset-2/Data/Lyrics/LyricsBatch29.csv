Behind the chair, a broken table there

Catherine,"With all the good times, when you want some, 
where is the fun, 
into your open arms, I will run, 
we'll have funny fun fun fun, 
I hear voices, from the angels, 
I hear voices, from the angels, 
I drove my beetle, to the bottom of the ocean, 
good times here we come, 
feeling faded, super-psycho sedated, 
I bet on living but the dealer won, 
I hear voices, from the angels, 
I hear voices, from the angels, 
I hear voices, from the angels, 
lay your head down, go to sleep, 
lay your head down, go to sleep, 
lay your head down, go to sleep,

Catherine,"I have a drink in one hand, a crumpled twenty in the other, I've never felt better,

I've killed the fun forever, I feel my hearts been tarred and feathered, you've never looked better, 
I need my motorcycle, I want to leave here now forever, forever is never, 
who loves and rides away, will live to see another day, 
skinny, I can't stay, 

don't touch me there, don't touch me there, don't touch me there, don't touch me, don't touch me there, don't touch me there, don't touch me there, don't touch me,

Catherine A.D.,"Don't need the money nothing can buy
All that I feel under the skies
Shadows were falling my heart beat inside
We walk through the fields to the rivers of ice

Days turn to color and darkness to light
She said I want you I need you I want you in my life
Love in the shadows the blood rushed inside
Carry on little savior to the end of the line

I get high for ever
Till the river runs dry for every
Ooh for ever

It's been so many years now I still can't forget
Love flew like an eagle in God's wilderness
Shadows were falling oh my heart beat inside
We kissed on the bridge above the river of ice

I get high for ever
The river runs dry for ever
I get high for ever
The river runs dry for ever

Ooh she tells me
Ooh she tells me

Tell the end of the line

Catherine Britt,"Kissed you twice it was nice
I will not apologise
Ran away too change my mind
Well at least I didn't lie
Do do do do do
Wherever I go there I am
Wherever I've been so I've been
I'll never take it back again
I can't change a thing
I was once really shy
I didn't know which way to go
Too afraid to speak my mind
Know I think that I might know

Wherever I've been so I've been

Catherine Britt,"I don't have to put on makeup 
I don't have to do my hair 
And when I open up that Hagen Das
I don't have to share
And there's no one there to notice
If I gain a couple pounds
And that's the upside of bein' down

I've got twice the closet space
That I can fill up with new shoes
And I can paint the bedroom pretty pink
With lacy curtains if I choose
And I won't have to deal with fishing gear
Muddy boots layin' 'round 
And that's the upside of bein' down

Days when I'm feelin' low
Yeah, I got 'em
When my tears won't stop fallin' to the ground
But there's only one place left to go
When you're at the bottom
And that's the upside of bein' down

I can let my dog jump on the bed
And curl up next to me at night
I don't have to lose an argument
'Cause now I'm always right
And I can dance with who I want to 
When I go out on the town
And that's the upside of bein' down

Days when I'm feelin' low
Yeah, I got 'em
When my tears won't stop fallin' to the ground

When you're at the bottom

And like so many times before

But I don't feel it anymore
It's just so hard to do
This falling out of love with you

When you look into my eyes
'Cause I've never been too good
At telling you a lie
And it's just so hard to do
This falling out of love with you

And I can't go on faking this love that we ain't making

Catherine Britt,"Well, the rumor is that you've been seen
Running like and old greyhound
Acting like you're over me
Out there painting the town
And it seems, no matter where I go
Your bark can't be ignored
You show up with a brand new pup
Waggin' your tail out on the floor

Just a-hot doggin (hot doggin)
Just a-hot doggin (hot doggin)
Showing off, making the rounds
Hot doggin all over town

Well, it's clear to see, you got a bone to pick
Ever since I threw you out
And I've heard you've learnt a few new tricks
Living in the old doghouse
Well, you stay out late an' you tell your friends
That you ran away from home
You say you broke your leash
Now you're out of the streets
Like an' old stray that's ready to roam

Just a-hot doggin (hot doggin)
Just a-hot doggin (hot doggin)
Showing off, making the rounds

Wagging your tail like you're over us
Out on the floor, strutting your stuff

Catherine Britt,"Heard your key hit the lock, honey
It was three o'clock, you came crawling in
Saw you slip your boots off
Trying not to get caught
Coming home late again
While you thought I was sleeping
I was layin there a-thinking
About the way you been doing me wrong
So goodbye, farewell, so long
I'm gone

I'm gone like a southbound freight train
Semi on a four lane
Rolling down a one way track
I'm gone, see you later alligator
Baby, I ain't ever coming back
I'll be a long way from here
And you'll be crying in your beer
Like an old Hank Williams song
So goodbye, farewell, so long, I'm gone

I'm tired of your white lies, stupid little alibis
Shoulda known all along
Well, all my friends warned me
Told me what you used to be
Baby, now I'm catching on
Well, I wrote this little ditty
Just for you an' it ain't pretty
And you can't sing along
So goodbye, farewell, so long
I'm gone

I'm gone like a southbound freight train
Semi on a four lane, rolling down a one way track

Would do her wrong when I know all along
You'd never be true to me

Well, I might be a little younger than most

You're saying I'm wrong but I know that I'm right

But I'm looking for a whole lot more
Than what you have in mind

Catherine Britt,"The sun is up, the time's at hand
There's a stir across the land
So begins another day
On life's highway

On city streets, down country roads
Like a stream, the people flow
There's bread to win and tolls to pay
On life's highway

There is hope with every turn
A bridge to build, a bridge to burn
Here's hoping you never go astray

Passing through, then passing on
Like roses bloom and fade

Catherine Britt,"Daddy had a chance to go
Take a factory jon in Ohio
The offered him a decent dime
To leave Kentucky far behind

Well, I cussed him when he turned em down
Standing farm, tobacco ground
Tobacco growing ain't no life
For seven kids and a poor man's wife

Money does not mean a thing
When you dream a farmer's dream
He could not toe that bottom line
Sometimes I cursed that poor man's pride
Cursed that poor man's pride

Now Daddy was a gambling man
He gambled on tobacco land
Bet your life every spring
To see what harvest time would bring

Could be drought, could be flood
Rolling dice was in his blood
No matter how it all went down
He's just as stubborn as that ground

Money does not mean a thing
When you dream a farmer's dream
He could not toe that bottom line
Sometimes I cursed that poor man's pride
Cursed that poor man's pride

Well, it finally drove him in the ground
Broke his back and put him down
Poor and proud is how he died
Sometimes I miss that poor man's pride






",Poor Man's Pride,2006
Catherine Britt,"I know there's music playing
I can hear it in my head
I can see you lying on your bed
I can see Mom in the kitchen
The smell of coffee in the air
Wishing that her little girl was there

But I'm too far gone
Trying to make it on my own
I guess I could turn around
And come back home
But I'm too far gone

You never tried to stop me from following my dream
Though it took me half way round the world, it seems
There's all this talk and promises for better days to come
And it sounds so good, it keeps me hanging on

But I'm too far gone
Trying to make it on my own
I guess I could turn around
And come back home
But I'm too far gone

Sometimes at night my heart cries out for you
And I wonder if you hear me when I do

But I'm too far gone
Trying to make it on my own
I guess I could turn around
And come back home
But I'm too far gone
Yes, I'm too far gone






",Too Far Gone,2006
Catherine Britt,"Standin' on the gone side of leavin'.
She found a thumb and stuck it in the breeze.
She'll take anything that's goin' close to somewhere.
She can lay it down and live it like she'd please

Chorus
She ain't goin' nowhere, she's just leavin'.
She ain't goin' nowhere she can't breathe in.
And she ain't goin' home, and that's for sure.

She's not sitting and cryin' on her suitcase.
She has no second thoughts by the road.
But she's feelins than need some reparin'.
And she did not give a damn that it showed.

Chorus

And the wind had it's way with her hair.
And the blues had a way with her smile.
And she had a way of her own.
Like prisoners have a way with a file.

",She Ain't Going Nowhere,2012
Catherine Britt,"One evening as the sun went down
And the jungle fire was burning
Down the track came a hobo hiking  
Said ""boys I'm not turning""     
I'm headed for a land that's far away
Beside the crystal fountain

So come with me we'll go and see
The Big Rock Candy Mountains
In the Big Rock Candy Mountains
There's a land that's fair and bright         
Where the handouts grow on bushes   
And you sleep out every night
Where the boxcars all are empty
And the sun shines every day
All the birds and the bees
And the cigarette trees
And the lemonade springs
Where the bluebird sings
In the Big Rock Candy Mountains    
          
In the Big Rock Candy Mountains
All the cops have wooden legs
And the bulldogs all have rubber teeth                              
And the hens lay soft boiled eggs             
And the farmer's trees are full of fruit
And the barns are full of hay

Where there ain't no snow     
Where the rain don't fall
The wind don't blow

And the brake men have to tip their hats 
And the railway bulls are blind         
There's a lake of stew  
And of whiskey too
You can paddle all around 'em In a big canoe            
In the Big Rock Candy Mountains

In the Big Rock Candy Mountains        
All the jails are made of tin
And you can walk right out again                
Just as soon as you are in
Well there ain't no short handed shovels
No axes, saws or picks 
Well I'm a gonna stay      
Where you sleep all day       
Where they hung the Turk that invented work

Y avait pas grand-chose à faire

On va danser chez Bibi
On s’est trouvé un violon
Un salon des partenaires
Puis là la soirée commence
C’était vers sept heures et demie

Entrez mesdames
Entrez messieurs
Marianne a sa belle robe
Et pis Rolande a ses yeux bleus
Yvonne a mis ses souliers blancs
Son décolleté pis ses beaux gants
Ça aime à faire les choses en grand
Ça vient d’arriver du couvent
Y a aussi Jean-Marie
Mon cousin puis mon ami
Qu’a mis sa belle habit
Avec ses p’tits souliers vernis
Le v’là mis, comme on dit
Comme un commis voyageur

Quand on danse à Saint-Dilon
C’est pas pour des embrassages
C’est au reel pis ça va vite
Il faut pas passer de pas

Il faut bien suiv’ le violon
Si vous voulez pas être sage
Aussi bien d’partir tout de suite
Y a ni temps ni place pour ça

Tout l’monde balance
Et pis tout l’monde danse
Jeanne danse avec Antoine
Et pis Jeannette avec Raymond
Tit-Paul vient d’arriver
Avec Thérèse à ses côtés
Ça va passer la soirée
À faire semblant de s’amuser
Mais ça s’ennuie d’Jean-Louis
Son amour et son ami
Qui est parti gagner sa vie
L’aut’ bord de l’île Anticosti
I’ est parti un beau samedi
Comme un maudit malfaiteur

Ont dansé toute la soirée
Le brandy pis la plongeuse
Et le corbeau dans la cage
Et pis nous v’là passé minuit
C’est Charlie qui a tout callé
A perdu son amoureuse
I’ s’est fait mettre au pacage
Par moins fin mais plus beau que lui

Un dernier tour la chaîne des dames avant de partir
A’ m’a serré la main plus fort
A’ m’a r’gardé, j’ai perdu l’pas
Dimanche au soir après les vêpres
J’irai-t-i’ ben, j’irai-t-i’ pas
Un p’tit salut, passez tout droit

J’avais jamais viré comme ça
Me v’là tout étourdie
Mon amour et mon ami
C’est ici qu’i’ s’est mis
À la tourner comme une toupie
Elle a compris pis elle a dit:
Les mardis pis les jeudis
Ça ferait-i’ ton bonheur?

Quand un p’tit gars de Saint-Dilon
Prend sa course après une fille
I’ la fait virer si vite
Qu’elle ne peut plus s’arrêter
Pour un p’tit air de violon
A’ vendrait toute sa famille
À penser qu’samedi en huit
I’ peut p’t-être la r’inviter

Et pis là ôte ta capine
Pis swingue la mandoline
Et pis ôte ton jupon
Pis swingue la Madelon
Swingue-la fort
Et pis tords-y le corps
Et pis fais-y voir
Que t’es pas mort

It's your chance to wake up and plan another brand new day.

Shouldn't hide, still inside, shouldn't hide,

The magic thrill that's in your touch,
Oh darling, I love you so much!

The breathless world of your embrace.

The starlight gleaming in your eyes;
Remembering all these little things,

Scattered pictures of the smiles we left behind

Or has time rewritten every line
If we had the chance to do it all again
Tell me, would we?
Could we?

Birds of a feather
Now and forever
Wheeee

La, la, la)

Kidnap the Sandy Claws
Lock him up real tight
Throw away the key and then
Turn off all the lights

First, we're goin' to set some bait
Inside a nasty trap and wait
When he comes a-sniffing we will
Snap the trap and close the gate

Wait, I've got a better plan
To catch this big red lobster man
Let's pop him in a boiling pot
And when he's done we'll butter him up

Kidnap the Sandy Claws
Throw him in a box
Bury him for ninety years
Then see if he talks

Then Mr. Oogie Boogie man
Can take the whole thing over then
He'II be so pleased, I do declare
That he will cook him rare, wheee

I say that we take a cannon, aim it at his door
And then knock three times
And when he answers
Sandy Claws will be no more

Yes you're so stupid, think now
If we blow him up to smithereens
We may lose some pieces
And then Jack will beat us black and green

Kidnap the Sandy Claws
Tie him in a bag
Throw him in the ocean
Then, see if he is sad

Because Mr. Oogie Boogie
Is the meanest guy around
If I were on his boogie list
I'd get out of town

He'II be so pleased by our success
That he'll reward us too, I bet
Perhaps he'll make his special brew
Of snake and spider stew

We're his little henchmen and
We take our job with pride
We do our best to please him
And stay on his good side

I wish my cohorts weren't so dumb
I'm not the dumb one
You're no fun
Shut up
Make me
I've got something, listen now
This one is real good, you'll see

We'II send a present to his door
Upon there'll be a note to read
Now, in the box we'll wait and hide
Until' his curiosity
Entices him to look inside
And then we'll have him
One, two, three

Kidnap the Sandy Claws
Beat him with a stick
Lock him up for ninety years, see what
Makes him tick

Kidnap the Sandy Claws
Chop him into bits

Is sure to get his kicks

On September twelfth right here
In front of the Waverly

He resembles George Harrison of The Beatles
But he wears his hair tied in a small bow at the back
I love him but it embarrasses me
To walk down the street with him
He lives in Brooklyn somewhere
And he wears his white crash helmet
He has golden chains on his leather jacket
And on the back are written the names
""Mary"" and ""Mom"" and ""Hell's Angels""

Tell him Angela and I don't want the two dollars back just him",Frank Mills,1999

Remember somewhere the sun is shining
And so the right thing to do is make it shine for you

Catherine Reed,"There are places I'll remember
All my life, though some have changed
Some forever, not for better
Some have gone and some remain
All these places had their moments
With lovers and friends, I still can recall
Some are dead and some are living
In my life, I've loved them all 

But of all these friends and lovers
There is no one compares with you
And these memories lose their meaning
When I think of love as something new
Though I know I'll never lose affection
For people and things that went before
I know I'll often stop and think about them
In my life, I'll love you more

Catherine Russell,"Took each word she said as gospel truth the way a silly little child would.
I can't excuse it on the grounds of youth, 
I was no babe in the wild, wild wood.
She didn't mean it, 
I should have seen it, 
But now it's too late.

I thought I'd found the girl of my dreams, 
Now it seems, 
This is how the story ends:
She's gonna turn me down and say, 
""Can't we be friends?""
I thought for once it couldn't go wrong, 
Not for long, 
I can see the way this ends:
She's gonna turn me down and say, 
""Can't we be friends?""
Why should I care though she gave me the air,
Why should I cry, 
Heave a sigh, 
And wonder why, 
And wonder why?
I thought I found the gal I could trust, 
What a bust, this is how the story ends:
She's gonna turn me down and say, 
""Can't we be just friends?""",Can't We Be Friends,2006
Catherine Russell,"I dim all the lights and I sink in my chair.
The smoke from my cigarette climbs through the air.
The walls of my room fade away in the blue,
And I'm deep in a dream of you.

The smoke makes a stairway for you to descend;
You come to my arms, may this bliss never end,
For we love anew just as we used to do
When I'm deep in a dream of you.

Then from the ceiling, sweet music comes stealing,
We glide through a lover's refrain, you're so appealing
That I'm soon revealing my love for you over again.
My cigarette burns me, I wake with a start;
My hand isn't hurt, but there's pain in my heart.
Awake or asleep, ev'ry mem'ry I'll keep
Deep in a dream of you.",Deep in a Dream,2006
Catherine Russell,"In the dark
There's just you and I

When he places his fingertips upon my lips
And he begs me, ""please be still
In the dark""

And I know, baby, you are gonna be missed
Gee, I'm not pretending

Ma chanson d'écluse et de vent
Mon quartier d'ombre où vient rêvant

Des étoiles sur les monts calmes
Ma songerie aux murs de palmes
Où l'air est bleu

Mes bras d'ormes faibles merveilles
Renaissent ma soif et ma faim
Collier collier des soirs sans fin
Où le coeur veille

Est-ce qu'on sait ce qui se passe
C'est peut-être bien ce tantôt
Que l'on jettera le manteau
Dessus ma face

Coupez ma gorge et les pivoines
Vite apportez mon vin mon sang

Au fond de la nuit, les fermes sommeillent,
Cadenas tirés sur la fleur du vin,
Mais la fleur du feu y fermente et veille
Comme le soleil au creux des moulins
Comme le soleil au creux des moulins.

Aux ruisseaux gelés la pierre est à fendre
Par temps de froidure, il n'est plus de fous,
L'heure de minuit, cette heure où l'on chante
Piquera mon coeur bien mieux que le houx
Piquera mon coeur bien mieux que le houx.

J'avais des amours, des amis sans nombre
Des rires tressés au ciel de l'été,
Lors, me voici seul, tisonnant des ombres
Le charroi d'hiver a tout emporté
Le charroi d'hiver a tout emporté.

Pourquoi ce Noël, pourquoi ces lumières,
Il n'est rien venu d'autre que les pleurs,
Je ne mordrai plus dans l'orange amère
Et ton souvenir m'arrache le coeur
Et ton souvenir m'arrache le coeur.

Catherine Styron,"His pulpit's a corner at 19th and Main
His grip on the gospel is his one claim to fame
He hurls fire and brimstone at the cars passin' by
He offers salvation from the savior on high

His khakis are tattered, he ain't bathed in weeks
His bouts with the bottle show up on his cheeks
He looks like a scarecrow, a sight to behold
While he works for the shepherd, bringin' lambs to the fold

He points to the Bible he holds in his hand
Says, I'm proof that the good Lord can save any man

Son, it ain't what you're drivin' or the clothes that you wear
Material possessions won't matter up there
Someday in heaven with the angels I'll sing
And these rags that I'm wearin' will be fit for a king

He's fightin' a fever, in spite of the chills
He pulls up his collar and speaks of God's will
His body is weakened but his faith is still strong
He's filled with conviction for the mission he's on

'Cause a mansion is waitin', he'll be homeless no more
And his words will still echo from that far distant shore

Through every lifetime from scars that run deep
Follow the love tracks unrivalled unmatched

Set up high on the road of release

My aims, my itch, my foes, I've licked
My bed of flame my name
Spread myself round again
Spilled out my guts again
Think I might lay down again
Stitch me up I'm torn again

Follow the pipeline I laid it so deep
It flows out my window it flows out to sea
It curls round the mountain it takes up the slack
Book me the right plane I long to nip back
Set up high above the Pyrenees
Set up high on the road of relief

My league, my school, my game, my rules,
My bed I've made, my grave
Spread myself round again
Spilled out my guts again
Think I might lay down again
Stitch me up I'm torn again

Are failing me
Combined with mixed up living
My victory is escaping me

Cathy Chemi,"I never cared much for moonlit skies
I never wink back at fireflies
But now that the stars are in your eyes
I'm beginning to see the light

I never went in for afterglow
Or candlelight on the mistletoe
But now when you turn the lamp down low
I'm beginning to see the light

Used to ramble through the park
Shadowboxing in the dark
Then you came and caused a spark
That's a four-alarm fire now

I never made love by lantern-shine
I never saw rainbows in my wine
But now that your lips are burning mine
I'm beginning to see the light

Hearing guitars like someone in love.
Sometimes the things I do astound me, 
Mostly whenever you're around me.

Hes the big affair I cannot forget
Only man I ever think of with regret
I'd like to add his initial to my monogram

There's a somebody I'm longing to see
I hope that he turns out to be
Someone who'll watch over me
I'm a little lamb who's lost in the wood
I know I could always be good
Someone who'll watch over me

But even I know the in-betweens and outs
My lowly brain can comprehend
But if it's simple you want
Then don't go looking for love
It'll complicate you in the end

I may be hollow, but I've had my fill
A vital love I wasn't afraid to spill
And in the morning when I'm hollow still
There wont be any room for us

I had the same stubbornness as my rival
Wouldn't even compromise 
When it was it was too even steven 
Didn't want to be eating
Such a big piece of the humble pie
It was a hard lesson to learn then
But I wont go do that again
No if its easy I want
I wont go dishing at love
Like its something I've got plenty of

I may be hollow, but I've had my fill
Of vital love I wasn't afraid to spill
And in the morning when I'm hollower still
There won't be any room for us

I have the same attitude as my mother
And I think I'll see it out alone
It may be sweet to share a bed
But when you're fucking with my head
This stopping pit is now a no-go zone

I know the things I said were far from being kind

Seem so meaningless without you

They don't know, 
If I could change the way of the world I'd be your girl.

Too many dreams have been shattered around us.
If I seem to give up they'd still never win.
Deep in my heart I know the strength is within.
 
Watching the others chances drift by.
They'll never discover these feelings I hide.
Deep inside I'm falling apart.
All alone with a broken heart.
Thinking in silence is all they allow.
These words still unspoken may never be found.
All these dreams one day will be mine.
They cross my mind.
My time has yet to come.  Until then.

The weather was bone dry
The sun was so hot I froze myself
Suzanne, don't you go on and cry
I said, oh, Susannah
Now, don't you cry for me

Well I had myself a dream the other night
When everything was still
I dreamed that I saw my girl Suzanne
She was coming around the hill
Now, the buckwheat cake was in her mouth
A tear was in her eye

I looked to the children, I drank from the fountains

Cathy Rutten,"I met a boy called Frank Mills
On September twelfth right here
In front of the Waverly
But unfortunately I lost his address
He was last seen with his friend, a drummer
He resembles George Harrison of The Beatles
But he wears his hair tied in a small bow at the back
I love him but it embarrasses me
To walk down the street with him
He lives in Brooklyn somewhere
And he wears his white crash helmet
He has golden chains on his leather jacket
And on the back are written the names
""Mary"" and ""Mom"" and ""Hell's Angels""
I would gratefully appreciate if you see him tell him
I'm in the park with my girlfriend and please
Tell him Angela and I don't want the two dollars back just him",Frank Mills,2003

From headlights through all ninety two box cars
She will not rest
And so too, I move toward you

Catie Curtis,"My backyard is filling up with new flowers
From a garden I had years ago
Look how long it took to grow
My old friends had kids right out of high school
While I watched for the signs on the road
Look how long it takes to grow

I guess I’ve been a lot of places
Trying to get all of my prizes
Now they don’t mean so much anymore
What does my sun shine for
I got two reasons more

As a young girl I had just the one dream
And I followed it straight through the dark
Long how strong it makes your heart
Now my back yard is filling up with new flowers
I can’t seem to get anything done
Hanging out all day with the littlest one

Catie Curtis,"We are passing this world on to our kids
From the day when they climb from their cribs
We'll try and teach them well, show them that they're loved
But in the end all we can do is hope our best was good enough
They'll witness how this life can be so beautiful and cruel
We can't shelter them forever but if we show them all the tools
They might leave this world in a little better shape than me and you
We are only passing through

Passing through, passing through
We are only passing through
Passing through, passing through
We are only passing through

We are watching this world from our living rooms
Near forty years since we walked on the moon
This big blue ball is shrinking and I don't know if that's good
But for better or for worse now this whole world's our neighborhood
And there's no place left to run to, to stay above the fray
We better learn to get along not just to get our way
Not only for each other but our children's children too
We are only passing through

Passing through, passing through
We are only passing through
Passing through, passing through
We are only passing through

And I wonder sometimes what will I pass on
How much can one voice do with just a song
Sometimes injustice and indifference are all that I see
But I refuse to let my hope become the latest casualty
So I'll sing of love and truth and try to practice what I preach
If I can't change the world, I'll change the world within my reach
What better place to start than here and now with me and you

Where I send my thoughts to far off destinations
They may have a chance of finding a place
Where they're far more suited than here

I cannot guess what we'll discover
When we turn the dirt with our palms cupped like shovels
And with our filthy hands we'll wash one another
And not one speck will remain

I believe it's true there are roads left in both of our shoes
But if the silence takes you I hope it takes me too
Brown eyes I hold you near, you're the only song I wanna hear

And after the evening another day
And after a false love there comes a true love
I'd have you listen now to what I say

I swear my love is the finest young man
As fair as any the sun shines on
But how to save him, I do not know it
For he has got a sentence to be hung

As he was marching the streets of Derry
I own he marched up right manfully
Being much more like a commanding officer
Than a man to die upon the gallows tree

""What keeps my love so long in coming
Oh what detains her so long from me
Or does she think it a shame or scandal
To see me die upon the gallows tree""

And she was dressed all in woolen fine
The weary steed that my love was riding
It flew more swiftly than the wind

Marea tu licor y arrea

Sometime's I'm up

I know you'd agree

Slandered my name?
Why, he'd be right there
Taking the blame

He loves me so

Well, I came in from the garage, Officer, and I see him coming through the window
With my wife Roxanne there, sleepin'...like an angel...

You mean he was dead when you got home?

She had him covered with a sheet

Now, he shot off his trap

I can't stand that sap
Look at him go
Rattin' on me
With just one more brain
What a half-wit he'd be

If they string me up
I'll know who
Brought the twine

And I believed her!
That cheap little tramp
So, she was two-timing me, huh?
Well, then, she can just swing for all I care

Boy, I'm down at the garage
Working my butt off fourteen
Hours a day and she's up munchin' on god-damn bon bons and jazzing

That's why I never leave home without the 44

Passed out in a shady hotel room
With a hooker faced down in the restroom
The cockroaches in hypnosis
Sippin' what's left of spilled mimosas

That hotel was so cheap
I should've brought my own sheets
He wanted it and I wanted to
What's left to do I paid for the room

I'm greasy, grimey, two-timey
Butt-sniffing animal
And if I want it I get it
I'll eat that ass like a cannibal

I don't care If you think I'm dirty
I am dirty, learn me
I masturbated till my KY faded
Unh, I'm exhausticated

It's all over your face
Tell me how does it taste?
When the lights go off
And your head goes down
Don't let a drop go to waste
Go to town now

It's all over your face
Tell me baby how does it taste?
When the lights go off
And your head goes down
Don't let a drop go to waste

Is it all over my face?

Is it all over my face?
I'm in love dancing

Is it all over my face?
You've caught me love dancing
Is it all over my face?
I'm in love dancing

Baby, its all over your face
Looks like you've been eating paste
I came too close in your direction
DNA on your complexion

I don't care if you scream
My neighbors are all asleep
My thong on the floor
When I close the door
But I left open the screen

Your exact words were rock me
And so I did some bukkake, don't stop me
Lock your legs in that position
Ducktape on your mouth so listen

Ease on out and then I want in
If you didn't why'd you call me
You got me under you skin
On your skin I could come again

It's all over your face
Tell me how does it taste?
When the lights go off
And your head goes down
Don't let a drop go to waste
Put it down now

It's all over your face
Tell me baby how does it taste?
When the lights go off
And your head goes down
Don't let a drop go to waste

Cazwell,"The Latin explosion ain't new to me
I've been into foreskin since puberty
I want an uncut Latino with a libido
The size of Reno, Nevada to bang me
'Til My bladder splatters
A dick fatter than a beer can
Lay down, stand
Or in the back of his van
He sports Tommy, Adidas
Fubu, Timberland
Pinky ring on his hand
His wish is my command
I'll suck his dick on the can
Or on the Puerto Rican sand
That's my man with the nice clean fade
And when he gets paid, I get paid
And when I get laid, I'm glad he stayed
'Cause there's nothin' like more than foreskin
I drop my chin so I can fit it all in
And then he eats my ass
Like he eats rice and beans
Until the plate's clean
You know what I mean?

Yes, I do, just the other day
I got a blowjob from a hoe job
With no job
Seen him at the bar
Battin' his eyelashes
Show me where your cash is
I'll show where my stash is
His ass is on my bed
The head board hit his head
'Til his head turned red
In and out was the motion
KY was the lotion
And that's the way it goes girl
When you fuck until your toes curl
I rocked his world
With mad stamina
Hot like panama
Shot like an enema
I'm sending your ass back to the store to get some rubbers
So I change the covers

This is the kind of man that I want
This is the kind of sex that I need
This is the kind of man that I want
This is the kind of sex that I need

Well, it won't be long
Before he takes off my thong
(But it wasn't a thong until you put it on)
Shut the fuck up
I'm the one getting laid here
He's back from the bodega
With a case of beer and a bag of weed
So I'm on my knees pulling out the seeds
He wants to squeeze my 34Bs
Until I can't breathe
Someone pass the poppers and a bottle of lube
Before he bangs me from the back
With his rough rider attitude the routine
We fuck on the rug so the sheets stay clean
Damn, my man is heaven sent
He got me horny like the ex president
Just thinking of my man's big dick in my face
And then he cums in my face
And then runs out of the place
I don't care, he'll be back
'Cause he loves this ass
And when he's done his friends'll be over fast
You got a problem with me?
You should get your ass off of Avenue D.

See you like the type of guy that works at the pizza place
Sweat on his face mustache above his lips
Open shirt, gold chain and a crucifix
I like the type of guy that east vil style
Chill for a while if he's versatile
But the bottom direction give me his ass
And give me affection
Did I happen to mention?
(No, I don't think you did)
Well, I like to keep my man in the 718
'Cause I'm in the 212 and got things to do
(Like what?)
Like whatever, I wanna leave this
With no shame
Behind me
But all I see is his name on my caller ID
Which reminds me of the time we took three ecstasy
You know, one things leads to another
I see him on the weekends
(What about the weekdays?)
That's when I'm busy messin' with his brother

I got bodyguards, I got two big cars

So they knew from the start
This road would not lead to fame
All they really knew for sure
Was Jesus had called to them
He said ""come follow Me"" and they came
With reckless abandon, they came

Empty nets lying there at the water's edge
Told a story that few could believe
And none could explain
How some crazy fisherman agreed to go where Jesus went
With no thought to what they would gain
For Jesus had called them by name
And they answered

We will abandon it all for the sake of the call
No other reason at all but the sake of the call
Wholly devoted to live and to die for the sake of the call
The sake of the call

Drawn like the rivers are drawn to the sea
There's no turning back, for the water cannot help but flow

I spent the night in sleeplessness and rose at every sound,
Half in hopeless sorrow half in fear the day,
Would find the soldiers crashing through to drag us all away.
Then just before the sunrise I heard something at the wall,
The gate began to rattle and a voice began to call,
I hurried to the window and looked down to the street,
Expecting swords and torches and the sound of soldiers feet,

There was no one there but Mary so I went down to let her in,
John stood there beside me as she told us were she'd been,
She said they moved him in the night and none of us knows where,
The stones been rolled away and now his body isn't there.
We both ran toward the garden then John ran on ahead,
We found the stone and the empty tomb just the way that Mary said,
But the winding sheet they wrapped him in was just an empty shell,
And how or where they'd taken him was more than I could tell.

Something strange had happened there but what I did not know,
John believed a miracle but I just turned to go,
Circumstance and speculation couldn't lift me very high,
Cause I'd seen them crucify him and then I'd watched him die,
Back inside the house again all the guilt and anguish came,
Everything I'd promised him just added to my shame,
But at last it came to choices I denied I knew his name,
Even If he was alive it wouldn't be the same.

But suddenly the air was filled with a strange and sweet perfume,
Light that came from everywhere drove shadows from the room,
Jesus stood before me with his arms held open wide,
And I fell down on my knees and clung to him and cried,
He raised me to my feet and as I looked into his eyes,
Love was shining out from him like sunlight from the sky,
Guilt and my confusion disappeared in sweet release,
And every fear I'd ever had just melted into peace.

He's alive, He's alive, He's alive and I'm forgiven,
Heavens gates are open wide.
He's alive, He's alive, He's alive and I'm forgiven,

No sad tear solves goodbye

Don't be deceived by what you saw
It was inside that I cried

You treated me just like a queen
For me that wasn't enough
You showered me with expensive things
But I found a new love

Mistakes I made were fatal ones
Finally I see you cared
I can't undo what has been done
Now I need you, and you're not there

No long drawn out speeches
No sad tear solves goodbye

Don't be deceived by what you saw
It was inside that I cried

No more prayers to make for tomorrow
Our time has slipped away
I feel so helpless
There's nothing I can do or say
To make things better

It was inside that I cried
It was inside that I cried
No long drawn out speeches
No sad tear solves goodbye

It was inside that I cried for you
Now you're never coming back for me no more
Oh baby, I know that I was wrong
So you left me all alone, don't go
Don't be deceived by what you saw
It was inside that I cried

",Inside That I Cried,1993
Ce Ce Peniston,"I need a love to meet me half the way, the kind of love
That will always stay together, forever with you

Seems like something's in the air but we can't decide
Whether to love or leave is a question of pride
In every motion there's love, it's brought us around
To the fact reality, there's nothing to see

You win, I win, we lose
'Cause there's nothing else to choose
You win, I win, we lose
'Cause there's nothing left between me and you

I can often tell myself the things that I love to hear
And I can dream of a love that will never be
But it seems our love is not meant to be
So tell me what's on your mind to save us both the grief

Together in the beginning was a difference
But it seems our love's not meeting half the way
But who is right? Is everybody is wrong?
Sad song that we'll have to sing again and again
When the next one comes along

You win, I win, we lose
'Cause there's nothing else to choose
You win, I win, we lose
'Cause there's nothing left between me and you

I need a love to meet me half the way, the kind of love
That will always stay together, forever with you
I know that we can really make a change
All we gotta do is rearrange, my love, your love, our love

So much happiness now belongs to me
I've been hit by your love for the very first time
And I know you're the one, baby you're mine

It turns out that we like the same movies
We even like the same songs
I can't believe that there is someone like you
I can't believe I waited so long
What we have is something so special
A connection I hope won't be broken too soon
I just need you to tell me you love me
So I can be with you

CHORUS

I never thought that I needed another
Until the day I saw you
Everything I said I didn't want was
In front of me and so true
When you smiled I knew I was in for it
Your sweet face told me all that I needed to know
From that moment I knew what love was
And I hope that you did too

Bad Boy, who we die for
All day, everyday nigga

For the love of BIG, we bang out
Since my man died, we don't hang out
We blow brains out, we tear the club up, pull them things out
Mafia World, all my niggas max out
We Bad Boys, why y'all niggas cracked out
Coward niggas, most are burried down south
Far from gangstas, really hush puppies
niggas bearly speak when we discuss money
niggas stay yappin' when there's always somethin' funny
The realest niggas never took nuthin' from me
Rock ice, stay jig, fuck with niggas that got drunk, and hate kids
Got niggas on state bids, that hate movies like Rosewood and Matrix
Ayo, Biggie taught me well, Biggie told me how to flip bricks like cartwheel

To all my thugs who puffed him
To all my girls who hugged him
You love him, yell his name

I'd rather die on my feet, than live on my knees
Nigga please, I cock and squeeze for

Mafia

Representin' Bucktown
MAC 11's cocked back, niggas better duck down
Face down, you know the routine, the cream
Earings, you know the drama Biggie bring

For BIG I learn to grip aim and cock it
Once I got it, I lock it
Banger, big city boy with deep pockets
See me speak, that paper better be the topic
I like my ice frozen like the Antarctic
I'm quick to finish it, your good to start it
And with the flashy colors on, you just a target, waitin' for a hard hit
I like marine blue, marine green, roll with a mean team
Meshed out, fresh out, and stay greams
We big boys, we do big things, born in this county of kings
I ain't got shit, I spray things, take things
Fuck whenever my mood swings, from the summer for the winter to the spring
My nigga Ill's holdin' it down from the Bean 
Like BIG said, we do the real things, we still bubble and steal chains
Still tustle, still struggle, we feel pain
Still ride, still die for BIG's name

For BIG I grip the Sig, put six in your wig
Not 'cause of what he said, 'cause of what he did
When I hear that pop quiz, that's the way I was raised and that's the way it is for
We roll like the Panthers, show our guns on camera
Do jukes with police scanners, niggas mediocre, full of dirt like hampers
I roll with a bunch of niggas that wear bandanas and rep
We kept it thorough, from the heart rep the borough
B.K. style, see BIG howl, now
Lets see who, wanna go against Mafia World
Niggas nuthin' but squirrels, they know we rep
Niggas tryin' to get a nut, hit in the head or below the gut
Wood style roll 'em up, get plucked, nigga what
Go back to spend a ton, and know cats wit gold tooths
Know my gat will bust for my nigga

All my girls who hugged him
You love him, yell his name

I'd rather die on my feet, than live on my knees

Make you drop to your knees, barly able to breathe

As she made her way to Jesus
She stumbles through the tears that made her blind

Some spoke in anger
Heard folks whisper
There's no place here for her kind
Still on she came
Through the shame that flushed her face
Until at last, she knelt before his feet
And though she spoke no words
Everything she said was heard
As she poured her love for the Master
From her box of alabaster

And I've come to pour
My praise on Him
Like oil from Mary's alabaster box

When he wrapped his love all around me and

I was a prisoner to the sin that had me bound
And I spent my days 
Poured my life without measure
Into a little treasure box
I'd thought I'd found
Until the day when Jesus came to me
And healed my soul
With the wonder of His touch
So now I'm giving back to Him
All the praise He's worthy of
I've been forgiven 
And that's why
