Sonic Youth,"What are you waiting for?

Satan flirts
I'm prepared
It's nothing to conquer
The fight is good
Your flesh has a limit
Of too many years
It's a shock absorber of your stinging tears
The satisfaction
And power
And control
And piss
Is ruled by the laws of deception
Lost in laws of deception
We shake our heads
As your tables turn
They'll always turn
And you'll never burn
That's the real promise
You'll never burn
You get the lies
We get the fire
You get the lies
We get the fire",Satan Is Boring,1985
Sonic Youth,"Society is a hole
It makes me lie to my friends
It's running down my street
With white powers sneakers
On the beautiful beat of black feet
Society is a hole
It beats my friends big heads
My friends have big heads,
I can understand it
But I don't recommend it
You got big big hair
And everybody is scared
Society is a hole
It makes me lie to my friends
The assault of holy music
There's a slap in my face
My friends are girls wrapped in boys
We're living in pieces
I want to live in peace
Society is a hole",Society Is a Hole,1985

Sonic Youth,"I kneel before the green light
Of her singing crayon eyes
And then I kiss her stomach
And it's then I realize:
Her light is the night
I'm not blind, I believe in you
I see a green light
I see a green light
I see a green light",Green Light,1986
Sonic Youth,"They were

Aaaah
He did what he had to do
He asked no questions
He had few conversations
The tar glistens in the noon heat
He tread across the grass, up onto, and down off of, the concrete abutments

Mirage on the highway
Ghosts in the tunnel
The dark cave

Out into the blinding light of day at breakneck speed
Every bolt rumbling

Glistening highway mirage groans
The slick surface
Careening into first the small mammal, and then screeching along the guard
Rail, scraping paint and throwing sparks like sheets of pure terror for
400 yards
Over and over

With one final back and forth rocking motion coming to rest
Wheeehah

The beautiful paint job hopelessly marred

Smoke and flames

Alright
So nice
He moved to the small creature
Screeching whistles of steam blowing off
On it's back, wheels spinning like a cinema classic
The door sags open and a man covered in blood drops the three feet or so to
The pavement
The car still rattling and shaking as if with a mind of it's own, unwilling
To die
The man, 40ish, also after a time, an agonizingly painful period of time

Is also unwilling to die

Suddenly all is quite quiet there in the sunlight on the highway
But what? what can I do?
I cannot move, everything is about broken
Blood everywhere, mixing with oil and gas
What's moving, must turn my head
Pain, white light, blinded
Some guy there kneeling in the blinded mirage of white light
All my strength to 'heeeeeelp'
Screaming now help me please
He tried to tamp out the bit of burning ember which had lept from the wreck
Onto his grimy coat sleeve
Coughing blood
What's happen?
He's he's inching towards truth
He strode of into the woods with the animal
It still lived
He didn't glance back at all

Still out ghosting the road
Death on the highway
Words crumble around me and fall with the weight of heaven
I cannot move
I'm beneath the great weight
I cannot see
My eyes are blinded
I am in the darkness

That's it

{very low in the mix}
In panic I forget it
In despair I need it
In my mind I save it
In death I have it
{then a bit louder}
In panic I forget it
In despair I need it

I shouldn't laugh
Hah hah hah
Yeah really
Oh

In panic I forget it
In despair I need it
In my mind I save it
In death I have it

Never gave a damn about the meterman

Sonic Youth,"Sound asleep till right until day
Frustrated desire turns you away
And turns you insane
Over and over

You get to a point
To make it disappear
And you're always believing
And believing in fear
Over and over
And over and over
And over and over

Marilyn Moore

It's always a headache the size of a tour truck
She's full of disorders, depends what you're used to
She's talking of tranches of truncheons in battle

Of bruises from bottles that never get better
Bad baby bitching she screams at the door
Hammer in hand & her head to the floor
Marilyn Moore",Marilyn Moore,1986
Sonic Youth,"We're gonna kill
The California girls
We're gonna fire the exploding load in the milkmaid maiden head

Of feeling good
And we're gonna stay there as long as we think we should

His sister came over she was out of her mind
She said Jesus had a twin who knew nothing about sin
She was laughing like crazy at the trouble I'm in

Her brother says she's just a bitch with a golden chain
She keeps coming closer saying ""I can feel it in my bones
Schizophrenia is taking me home""

What's a man to do but work out whether it's true?
Looking for a man with a focus and a temper
Who can open up a map and see between one and two?

Time to get it before you let it get to you
Here he comes now, stick to your guns, let him through

Everybody's coming from the winter vacation
Taking in the sun in a exaltation to you
You come running in on platform shoes
With Marshall stacks to at least just give us a clue

Ah, here it comes, I know it's someone I knew
Teenage riot in a public station, gonna fight and
Tear it up in a hyper nation for you

Now I see it, if you've got, leave it, out of the way
Now I come near you and it's not true, why you make away?

Looking for a ride to your secret location
Where the kids are setting up a free speed nation for you
Got a Foghorn and a drum and a hammer that's rockin'
And a cord and a pedal and a lock that'll do  for now

It better work out, I hope it works out my way
'Cause it's getting kind of quiet in my city head
It's a teen age riot to get me out of bed right now

You better look it, we're gonna shake it, up to him
He acts the hero, we paint a zero on his hand

We know it's down, we know it's bound to lose
Everybody's sound is around you
Everybody wants to be proud to choose
So who's to blame for the stormy weather?
You're never gonna stop all the teenage leather and booze

Hey what are you waiting for feeding, feeding me
I feel like I'm disappearing getting smaller every day

You aren't never going anywhere
You aren't never going anywhere
I ain't never going anywhere
I ain't never going anywhere

I'm in heaven now I can see you Richard
Goodbye Hollywood, goodbye Downey - hello Janis
Hello Dennis, Elvis - and all my brand new friends
I'm so glad you're all here with me, until the very end
Dreaming, dreaming of how it's supposed to be
But now this tunic's spinning around my arms and knees
I feel like I'm disappearing getting smaller every day
But when I open my mouth to sing - I'm bigger in every way

You aren't never going anywhere
You aren't never going anywhere
I ain't never going anywhere
I ain't never going anywhere

Hey mom! look I'm up here - I finally made it
I'm playing the drums again too
Don't be sad - the band doesn't sound half bad
And I remember mom, what you said
You said honey - you look so under-fed

Another green salad, another ice tea
There's a tunic in the closet waiting just for me
I feel like I'm disappearing - getting smaller every day
But I look in your eyes - and I'm bigger in every way

You aren't never going anywhere
You aren't never going anywhere
I ain't never going anywhere
I ain't never going anywhere

Finger on the love, it's all above

Everywhere it's six-sex-six by luck
A satellite wish will make it just enough
You'll be making out with a witch in a coffee truck

Time to rock the road and tell the story of the jelly rollin'

My eyes can focus
My brain is talking
It looks pretty good to me
My head's on straight, my girlfriend's beautiful
It looks pretty good to me

Sometimes I speak
Tonight there's nothing to say
Sometimes we freak
And laugh all day

Hold these pages up to the light
See the jackknife inside of the dream
A railroad runs through the record stores at night
Coming in for the deep-freeze

Mary, a simple word, are you there in the cold country?
Your eyes so full, your head so tight
Can't you hear me?
Remember our talk that day on the phone?
I said I was the door, and you were the station
With shattered glass and miles between us
We still flew away in the conversation

My cup is full, and I feel okay
The world is dull, but not today

She think's she's a goddess
She says she talks to the spirits
I wonder if she can talk to herself?
If she can bear to hear it?

This is Eric's trip
We've all come to watch him slip
He's slipping all the way to Texas
Can you dig it?

I see with a glass eye
The pavement view
A shadow forming, across the fields rushing
Through me to you

We tore down the world, and put up four walls
I breathe in the myth
I'm over the city, fucking the future
I'm high and inside your kiss

We can't see clear
But what we see is alright
We make up what we can't hear
And then we sing all night

Scattered pages and shattered lights
See the jackknife, see the dream
There's something moving over there to the right
Like nothing I've never seen",Eric's Trip [Live],1991

I know you, I'm from you
I know you, I'm from you

Who
I'm coming home to Swall Drive

Cowboys are languishin'
Little girl's are bees
Is it really a green stage coach
Crawling up to me

I dreamt that you were my vacation
Woke to find desire and dislocation
Yr always heavy in rotation
Coming on, flirting with the nation
I feel that I could burst
Gimme a little drink of yr sweet shine
Why is the way you grew ?
Still in the soul wanting you ?
Smelling the night jasmine
Hypnotises me
The flower tells me stories
That make me sick and free
I know you, I'm from you
I know you, I'm from you

I'm coming home momma, to Swall Drive

Down past 1st and Vine

Look it's changing colors, it's bigger than a hose ?

With Marshall stacks to at least just give us a clue

Teenage riot in a public station
Gonna fight and tear it up in a hibernation for you

I think I'll leave it out of the way

And a cord and a pedal and a lock, that'll do me for now

We know it's bound too loose

Are you close enough to see into their eyes?

A dream's a dream of feelings
That never fall at all
Holds his thoughts in chains
And tries to bust up the walls

Every night another little death
Do you scratch and itch when your head feels tight
Or wave it away and just stay out all night?

Got your head in the trees
If that's the way you're feeling
It's not good or bad

Clothes flung out of closets, doorknobs falling off
The guitar guy played real good feedback, and super sounding riffs
With his mild mannered look on, yeah he was truly hip
The girl started out in red patent leather
Very I'm in a band with knee pads
We watch her fall over and lay down, 
Shouting the poetic truths of high school journal keepers
Row house row house pass through, let the city rise up

See you on the highway
Now we're told so merge ideas, of song forms and freedom

The edge of a blade pressed to the throat of your reflected image
Poised, yet totally screwed up

Gonna fight and tear it up in a hypernation for you

Now I see it
I think I'll leave it out of the way

And a cord and a pedal and a lock, that'll do me for now

I hope it works out my way
Cause it's getting kind of quiet in my city's head

We paint a zero
On his hand

We know it's bound too loose

Sonic Youth,"When the phone rang, 3 in the morning
Dead middle of night
There was nothing on the line
I set back the silent receiver
Tiny flames lit in my head
Hey did any of you freaks here ever remember Lenny?
I can't remember his last name
He's turned to dust now, one of the chosen few
Left out in the rain, out of town again
Left out in the rain, ocean bound I guess

Between the mattress
And a column of hazy faces
I remember every word you said
Quite a clear picture: every word you said
The door was open but the way was not lit
And there was no way out of my head

On a crimson highway by a chrome bumper
I last saw you alive, inclined to thrive
Evening fireflies lit sparks around your head
But wait a minute, let's back up a bit
Some famous stars were busted
Down on fashion avenue
Impersonating real men
Not knowing who they really were

Now here at dark corners all is calm and quiet
And good
The kids are up late dreaming quiet questions
In a graceful mood
Can you please pass me a jug of winter light?
Fold me in an ocean's whim?
In sweet corrosive fire light?
In the city made of tin?
Are you famous under the skin?
Familiar with the things you wanted?
Able now to take it all in?
Making peace with every hole in the story?

Did lightning keep you up all night?
Illuminate the soot and grit?
Can you tell how high the sky tonight?
Dig out from under in spite of it?
Can you cover up the one that floats?
Push back the hours?
I hear your voice, I speak your name
Among New York City ghosts and flowers
Will we meet? To run again?

It don't have approximation she is smiling fairly well

Her smile is contagious, I was born to love her
But she knows that the kingdom waits so high above her
And I run by the race but it's not too fast stayed
But I got the fever I'm not there, I'm gone

Well, it's all about diffusion as I cry for her veil
I don't need anybody now beside me to tell
And it's all affirmation, I'm asleep but it's not
She's a lone-hearted beauty but she don't like spot
And she calls

Yeah, she's gone like a rainbow that was shining yesterday
But she's home now beside me and I'd like her to stay
She's a lone forsaken beauty and she don't trust no one
And I wish I was beside her but I'm not there, I'm gone

It's too hard to stay here and I don't want to leave
It's so hard for so few you see but she's hard to, hard to me
It's a [Incomprehensible] it's a crime, the way she mauls me around
But she don't phone to hate me but it's down to make her crown

Yes, I believe that it's rightful, I believe it in my mind

Yes, the soul gypsy told her like I said carry on
Wish I was there to help me but I'm not there, I'm gone

To come and give me life.

Sadness sweeping over the world
Can't you feel it?  Why is it so hard for us to love? And so easy to hate
I want to live on a happier planet
Where judgment is not by color of skin
I want to live on a happier planet
Where I'm respected for the love I give
Do you find this all entertaining? Destruction of the human race
If there is a God out there somewhere
How much more can we take? Oh yeah, ah
[repeat chorus]

Traveled all around the earth
Searching for a love--it's hard to find
So hard to find
I go home switch on my TV
All I see is pain, and there's no gain
When will it end? Take it from me, my heart is yearning
How long can this carry on?
Seeking the sounce of my inspiration
To set my spirit free

But I'm not sure.
These emotions, I have a little fear, but Ill find strength in my tears
I don't know who is wrong, so I will just sing this -

I cannot make up mine,
Should I be good or bad,
Should I go with the flow,
Will I take control?
It may not be up to me, it must be up to you,
I don't know what to do, maybe Ill call on you.

Without you by my side

You're yodeling to your baby
You'll feel nice and warm

They ski down a hill that's a snowplow turn
And look there's a spill
There's a spill on the hill 
When you're down it's a thrill to go up again.

Ev'rybody ought to learn to ski for that is how we first met
We were that Jack and Jill that came down a hill,
When I looked at you my hearttook a spill
Took a spill on a hill

There were sunbeams in the snow
and a twinkle in your eye
I remember oh so clearly
that you nearly passed me by

Then It Happened In Sun Valley
when you slipped and fell and so did I
Now ev'ry year we go back
and then we recall that fall and that moment
When we were there on a hill
So we both take a spill and we're Jack and Jill again.

Sonja Kristina,"I met a boy called Frank Mills
On September twelfth right here
In front of the Waverly
But unfortunately I lost his address
He was last seen with his friend, a drummer
He resembles George Harrison of The Beatles
But he wears his hair tied in a small bow at the back
I love him but it embarrasses me
To walk down the street with him
He lives in Brooklyn somewhere
And he wears his white crash helmet
He has golden chains on his leather jacket
And on the back are written the names
""Mary"" and ""Mom"" and ""Hell's Angels""
I would gratefully appreciate if you see him tell him
I'm in the park with my girlfriend and please
Tell him Angela and I don't want the two dollars back just him",Frank Mills,1969

And it's never ever gonna happen to you

Got your family, got your honey
You think you got a million days
But then life comes along
And it knocks you right down to the ground and that's why I say

And everybody oughta kiss somebody, at least once a day
Everybody's gonna miss somebody, at least once a day
And everybody gotta love somebody, every day

And so don't ever take for granted what the spirit has given you
In the first verse
You might never get a second verse
This ain't a rehearsal, you can't put it in reverse
Believe in yourself, don't let nobody be a negative
Or tell you what to do
'Cause I know ('cause I know)
In this sweet, sweet life that just this much is true

Everybody oughta hug somebody, at least once a day (once a day)
And everybody oughta kiss somebody, at least once a day (uh huh)
Everybody gonna miss somebody, at least once a day (yo, yo)
And everybody gotta love somebody, every day

Sonnee West,"Wasted days and wasted nights
I have left for you behind 
For you don't belong to me
You heart belongs to someone else
 
Why should I keep loving you
When I know that you're not true
And why should I call your name 
When you're to blame for making me blue
 
Don't you remember the day 
That you went away and left me
I was so lonely 
Prayed for you only, my love

Why should I keep loving you 
When I know that you're not true
And why should I call your name 
When you're to blame for making me blue

Sonny,"Now I've got it all planned out,
how I'm going to win you back.
First- I'll drive 2 days to see you 
Second- Show up to your door w/ roses behind my back.
Third- I'll say how much I can't live without you,
“You know I can't live without you”.

Breathe in the cold air,
it smells like every winter night we spent in the snow. 
Maybe I'm just a little crazy, but...
nobody's perfect.
And every night I want to see fireworks with you,
but even in my dreams 
I know this can't come true.

Though here I am at your doorstep.
“Won't you ask me to come inside?”
It's been 11 months since we sat on your couch... together.
And you never knew how much 
I wanted my hand on your knee.
Now please tell me how we feel so far apart.

Can I fix it now? 

This cold leather couch could be our starting ground 
and the truth will be told.
So tonight the light on the street won't be mine.",It's Never Too Late,2002
Sonny,"We grabbed a piece of driftwood 
Hold on tight and please don't let go

We'll follow the waves to the nearest shoreline
Wake up to the coast of some distant island in the South Pacific
Leave behind everything we once had
A brand new start with no one to tell us what to do
Tomorrow will tell us that we can make it too
And if that doesn't work you say
We'll flip a quarter and find a new place to go
Heads Kansas City, tails California

Never again stay within the boundaries of this town
Step outside the barrier
And I don't want to be the follower anymore
So take this string from out my back and let my feet be free again
I might stumble when I walk but at least I am on my own
And I won't say that it's the last time...

About old lost John
Lost John was a boy that got loose
From a chain gang down in Louisiana

About sixteen bloodhound, took in after him
Sheriffs, deputies
And everybody else in the county
Chasin' him all across the swamp

Lost John outrun the bloodhounds there
All night long, it was long towards mornin'
He looked up to the tree there
And seen the lights from a house

He didn't know whether the people inside
Was friends or were enemies
So he wanted to go up to the house
So, and asked if he could stay there
To get away from the bloodhounds

He was afraid if he did go up there
That the people might set their dogs
Barking at him or shoot him down
With a Winchester riffle

That's OK with me

It's OK with you
It's OK with me too

I think you should put the music down
Before the words down

What music?

To this song

There is no song

No, really

Really what?
There is no song
I'm just plinking on the piano
I only know seven chords any ways
So it doesn't make any difference
What do you mean
We should put the music first

I'm not gonna say anything to you
Come on Sonny

You're not gonna say anything, why?

Because you're making me embarrassed

Don't be embrassed
You're just talking to a microphone
And that's all
You have nothing to say at all

No

I didn't know you were bashful
When you get up on stage
You're not bashful
Now you're talking to a microphone
You're in a studio all by yourself
And you're bashful
You don't like this song?

No, I don't like this song

I'll try to write you a new one
I like it, I think
Well Cher you got to say something
Cher don't be bashful

I can't think of any thing to say

You always think of something
To say around the house
You never without words then

I can't help it, I'm bashful

OK I glad I found that out
After two years of marriage

Well I can sing some thing

I don't have a song for you to sing
Well just say something

Hello

That was very clever

I thought you'd like that

That's the most original thing you said
Any ways we thought
We break a precedent
And just say hello to every body
And that's the purpose behind this
And thanks again

A whole lot more than she ever did before
No more fights over little things
Because I won't be here to stop them anymore

I know you don't want this, neither do we
But sometimes things happen that we can't foresee
Now try to be calm kids, and don't look so sad
Just cause I am leaving, I'll still be your dad
Just remember I love you though I'm not here
Just call if you need me and I'll always be near

Sonny & Cher,"Sometimes when I'm down and all alone
Just like a child without a home
The love you give me keeps me hangin' on
Oh honey,  all I ever need is you
You're my first love, you're my last
You're my future, you're my past
And loving you is all I ask, honey
All I ever need is you
Winters come and they go, and we watch the melting snow
Sure as summer follows spring, all the things you do
Give me a reason to build my world around you
Some men follow rainbows, I am told
Some men search for silver some for gold
I have found my treasure in your soul, honey
All I ever need is you
Without love I'd never find the way
Through ups and downs of every single day
I won't sleep at night until you say, my honey
All I ever need is you",All I Ever Need Is You,1974
Sonny & Cher,"I just stood there watching you
As you took off my ring
Then you gently put it in my hand
I guess I knew there's someone else
You rather spend your life with
And you hoped that I would understand

So you put the ring in your pocket
I slowly turned to walk out the door
You were so much stronger
Than you've ever been before

[Chorus]
You put on the greatest show on earth
It was the greatest show on earth
But then I stopped dead in my tracks
And begged you to take me back

The next time that I saw you
You were waiting for a bus
I just happened to be passing by
When I said hello and every little thing
You said you'd be married and you lied

I guess you know that I've been keeping busy
I've been going out most every night
You were very happy
That my future looked so bright

[Chorus]

Yesterday I called to see
If we could meet somewhere
I've been thinking about you for some time
But soon as I walked in that place
Where we used to go
You knew just what I had on my mind

You thought it could be just like old times
Honey it could never be the same
I got up from the table walked away
While you remained

Was brushing her cat in her black limousine
On the backseat were scratches from
The marks of men her fortune she had won
Couldn't see through the tinted glass,
She said ""home James"" and he hit the gas
I followed her to some darkened room,
She took my money, she said ""I'll be with you soon""

Dark lady laughed and danced and lit the candles one by one
Danced to her gypsy music till her brew was done
Dark lady played back magic till the clock struck on the twelve
She told me more about me than I knew myself

She dealt two cards, a queen and a three
And mumbled some words that were so strange to me
Then she turned up a two-eyed jack,
My eyes saw red but the card still stayed black
She said the man you love is secretly true
To someone else who is very close to you
My advice is that you leave this place,
Never come back and forget you ever saw my face

Dark lady laughed and danced and lit the candles one by one
Danced to her gypsy music till her brew was done
Dark lady played back magic till the clock struck on the twelve
She told me more about me than I knew myself

So I ran home and crawled in my bed,
I couldn't sleep because of all the things she said
Then I remembered her strange perfume,
And how I smelled it was in my own room!
So I sneaked back and caught her with my man,
Laughing and kissing till they saw the gun in my hand
The next thing I knew they were dead on the floor,
Dark lady would never turn a card up anymore

I see the tears in your eye and your heart may cry
To my niggaz locked down it's gon' be alright
To my sisters in the hood tryin to make life better
You ain't by yourself, you're looking better
Whatever the storms that come
Life is full of them
Take a look in the mirror at yourself
Believe in yourself, yeahhhhhhhh

[Verse One: Jade]
Now I, understand that man gotta meet his quota but damn
Is it because I'm tan that you pull me over
My man, he gotta hustle cause he can't get a job
Slam the door in his face, because he caught a juvie case
It seems as if I got people tryin to pull me down
Red broads intimidatin insinuatin and hatin
I'm a young buck, keepin on a young tuck
Waitin for the next move, zippin up and lace shoes
And you niggaz tryin to get at me, uh-uh I never sweat be
This world is chilly but Willies could never catch me
Although you wasn't ready still ridin for you already
Make me wanna crack a vanilla dutch and smoke heavy
Oh, regardless you could come and holla at the O girl
The streets raised me so I'm ready for this cold world
You think you know but you have no idea
I'm never slippin, never runnin, here I go right here, c'mon

Known to rock a rhyme, a bonafide New Yorker
O.G. godfather, like Afrika Bambaataa
DMC comes harder, cause he gotta be smarter
Growin up in the city I can't be dumb diddy dumb
I'd rather be sittin pretty than in a city like a bum
I roll with some killers, some real bug niggaz
And some real ill figures that ain't scared to pull the trigger
My homies all dead, in jail or doin life
While the honies give us his and we treat 'em like a wife
There's a whole lot of shootin, and executin
And the crew keeps gettin stronger cause we keep on recruitin
We can never die, we just multiply
We keep the records in the store for the streets to buy

Can you tell me baby why the world is so cold
Why is Hennessy the only thing that warm my soul
Into the belly of the beast, I watch the hood cry

The world is so cold, yeah I can feel the breeze
Hatred is sacred, life's a dying disease
Livin to hustle, down to die for cheese
Just hustlin with muscle slugs are flyin with ease
Behind bars baby I seen the world is even colder
It seems like the weight of the world is on your shoulder

Before it's earned, our money's all been spent
I guess that's so, we don't have a plot
But at least I'm sure of all the things we got

Babe
I got you babe
I got you babe

I got flowers in the spring
I got you to wear my ring
And when I'm sad, you're a clown
And if I get scared, you're always around

Don't let them say your hair's too long
'Cause I don't care, with you I can't go wrong
Then put your little hand in mine
There ain't no hill or mountain we can't climb

Babe
I got you babe

I got you to hold my hand
I got you to understand
I got you to walk with me
I got you to talk with me
I got you to kiss goodnight
I got you to hold me tight
I got you, I won't let go
I got you to love me so

Sonny Burgess,"I never thought I'd say it
But I can't take anymore
We both work so hard that I forgot
Just what it was that we've been working for

This daily grind has wore us down
Where we hardly even talk when we come home
Girl, I think it would be best for us
If I had some time alone

Alone with you, together in love
Where we can't be reached while we get back in touch
Darlin', let's pull the shades and kill the lights in this room
I need some time alone, alone with you

I could go stay at my brother's and ask him
Why he thinks we've grown apart
Then come back in a week or two
And try to make a brand new start

Or I could belly-up to Shady's bar
And tell 'em all just where we went wrong
But I think we'd be better off
If I just spent some time alone

Alone with you, together in love
Where we can't be reached while we get back in touch
Darlin', let's pull the shades and kill the lights in this room
I need some time alone, alone with you

Haven't slept a wink
I walk the floor and watch the door
And in between I drink
Black coffee
Love's a hand me down brew
I'll never know a Sunday
In this weekday room

I'm talking to the shadows
From 1 o'clock til 4
And lord, how slow the moments go
When all I do is pour
Black coffee
Since the blues caught my eye
I'm hanging out on Monday
My Sunday dreams to dry

Now a man is born to go a lovin'
A woman's born to weep and fret
To stay at home and tend her oven
And drown her past regrets
In coffee and cigarettes

I'm moaning all the morning
And mourning all the night
And in between it's nicotine
And not much heart to fight
Black coffee
Feelin' low as the ground
It's driving me crazy just waiting for my baby
To maybe come around... around
I'm waiting for my baby
To maybe come around

My nerves have gone to pieces
My hair is turning gray
All I do is drink black coffee
Since my man's gone away

Rings and things and buttons and bows
Don't bury me in this prairie
Take me where the cement grows
Let's move down to some big town
Where they love a gal by the cut o' her clothes
And I'll stand out
In buttons and bows
I'll love you in buckskin
Or skirts that I've homespun
But I'll love ya' longer, stronger where
Yer friends don't tote a gun
My bones denounce the buckboard bounce
And the cactus hurts my toes
Let's vamoose where gals keep usin'
Those silks and satins and linen that shows
And I'm all yours in buttons and bows
Gimme eastern trimmin' where women are women
In high silk hose and peek-a-boo clothes
And French perfume that rocks the room

Somewhere along the Rio Grande
Sadly I'm reminiscing, madly again I'm kissing

I see the sparkle of her eye
And when I hear the cello
Tender and sweet and mellow
I hear the music of her sigh

I just wanted someone to be gay with,
To play with someone.
But now I realize that I could never let you go,
And I've come to tell you so;

Every kiss, every hug
Seems to act just like a drug;
You're getting to be a habit with me.
Let me stay in your arms,
I'm addicted to your charms;
You're getting to be a habit with me.
I used to think your love was something that I
Could take or leave alone.
But now I couldn't do without my supply,
I need you for my own.
Oh, I can't break away,
I must have you every day,
As regularly as coffee or tea.
You've got me in your clutches and I can't get free,
You're getting to be a habit with me,
(Can't break it!)
You're getting to be a habit with me.

I thought it was just another meeting,
But my fate had begun;
Something in my heart kept on repeating,
She's different, this one.
I'm getting, oh so used to having you around each day,
Don't you ever go away.

My dreams are as worthless as tin to me
Without you life will never begin to be
So love me as I love you in my reverie
Make my dream a reality 
Let's dispense with formality
Come to me in my reverie
 
Our love is a dream, but in my reverie
I can see that this love was meant for me
Only a poor fool never schooled in the whirlpool

There's a land that I've heard of once in a lullaby.

Really do come true.

And wake up where the clouds are far behind me.
Where troubles melt like lemon drops,
High above the chimney tops,
That's where you'll find me.

If happy little bluebirds fly beyond the rainbow

Out of town were the people I knew

It turned out to be the luckiest day I've known

A foggy day, in London town
Had me low, had me down
I viewed the morning, with much alarm
British Museum, had lost its charm

Could this thing last
But the age of miracles, hadn't past

They were serving drinks as usual, and the usual crowd was there
On my left stood Big Joe McKennedy, and his eyes were bloodshot red
And he turned his face to the people, these were the very words he said

I was down to St. James infirmary, I saw my baby there
She was stretched out on a long white table, 
So sweet, cool and so fair

Let her go, let her go, God bless her
Wherever she may be
She may search this whole wide world over
Never find a sweeter man as me

When I die please bury me in my high top Stetson hat
Put a twenty dollar gold piece on my watch chain
The gang'll know I died standing pat

Let her go, let her go God bless her
Wherever she may be
She may search this wide world over
Never find a sweeter man as me

Three pretty women to sing a song
Stick a jazz band on my hearse wagon
Raise hell as I stroll along

The ""Ile de France"" with all the gulls around it
The beauty that is Spring's
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The sigh of midnight trains in empty stations
Silk stockings thrown aside dance invitations
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

Gardenia perfume ling'ring on a pillow
Wild strawb'ries only seven francs a kilo
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
The smile of Garbo and the scent of roses
The waiters whistling as the last bar closes
The song that Crosby sings
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The scent of smould'ring leaves, the wail of steamers
Two lovers on the street who walk like dreamers
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you",These Foolish Things,2000

'Til you've learned the meaning of the blues
Until you've loved a love you've had  to lose,

Until you've kissed and had to pay the cost,
Until you've flipped your heart and you have lost,

At the thought of reminiscing,

Lose their taste for kissing?

The music stopped, but we were still dancing
Which goes to show that music has charms
The lights were low so we kept on dancing
I felt the glow of you in my arms
The band had left the stand and we were in heaven
Dancing on a cloud 'way off in the blue
The music stopped and people were glancing
But we went on dancin' for we didn't know
Because the lights were low
And we were in love

Sonny Dunham,"Star eyes,
That to me is what your eyes are,
Soft as stars in April skies are,
Tell me some day you'll fulfill
Their promise of a thrill.

Star eyes,
Flashing eyes in which my hopes rise,
Let me show you where my heart lies.
Let me prove that it adores
That loveliness of yours.

All my life I've felt
Content to stargaze at the skies.
Now I only want to to melt
The stardust in your eyes.

Star eyes,
When if ever, will my lips know
If it's me for whom those eyes glow?
Makes no diff'rence where you are,
Your eyes still hold my wishing star,
Oh, star eyes, how lovely you are.",Star Eyes,1994
Sonny Emory,"Baby, I was just a young girl
When you came on the scene 10 years ago
I thought I was hip, I could deal with the trips
No matter how fast or slow

I was like a moving violation
Give me a ticket and I'm ready to ride
Thought I was the queen of syncopation
You know you can't give the queen no bad advice

Thought I knew it all, baby
But I didn't know it all, baby
Thought I knew it all, baby
But I didn't know it all, baby

?Cause when you kissed my lips
When you kissed my lips
I was jammin'
Jammin' for the first time

Jammin', jammin'
Jammin' for the first time
Jammin', jammin'
Jammin' for the first time

Baby, I was young, I was green
When you showed me the ropes 10 years ago
I thought I was cool, I could break all the rules

Jammin' for the first time

I was a girl from the streets
Dancin' to the beat
Of a different kind of drummer
Little Ms. Know-it-all, you don't know it all

Caught up in the rhythm of sound
Living to get down
As the song became my lover
Attitude keeps your head up to the sky

Then you kissed my lips and, ooh
I lost my cool

Look at me I'm jammin'
And everything's happenin'
I'm feeling the bliss and the reason for this
Is the love in your kiss, baby
Jammin'

Jammin', jammin'
Jammin' for the first time
Jammin', jammin'

Thought I knew it all, baby
But I didn't know it all, baby

?Cause when you kissed my lips
And my backbone slipped
I was jammin'
Jammin' for the first time

The square root of a positive groove
Times a happening melody equals a jam
Give some to the back

No
Ooh, baby
No
You got me movin' and I'm jammin' for the first time

Has the murmuring sound of may
All silver bells, coral shells, carousels
And the laughter of children at play

Say Emily, Emily, Emily
And we fade to a marvelous view
Two lovers alone and out of sight
Seeing images in the firelight
As my eyes visualize a family
They see Emily, Emily

Seeing images in the firelight

Sonny Greenwich,"Oh! Will you never let me be?
Oh! Will you never set me free?
The ties that bound us
Are still around us
There's no escape that I can see
And still those little things remain
That bring me happiness or pain

A cigarette that bears a lipstick's traces
An airline ticket to romantic places
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
A tinkling piano in the next apartment
Those stumbling words that told you what my heart meant
A fair ground's painted swings
These foolish things remind me of you
You came you saw you conquer'd me
When you did that to me
I knew somehow this had to be
The winds of March that make my heart a dancer
A telephone that rings but who's to answer?
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

First daffodils and long excited cables
And candle lights on little corner tables
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
The park at evening when the bell has sounded
The ""Ile de France"" with all the gulls around it
The beauty that is Spring's
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The sigh of midnight trains in empty stations
Silk stockings thrown aside dance invitations
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

Gardenia perfume ling'ring on a pillow
Wild strawb'ries only seven francs a kilo
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
The smile of Garbo and the scent of roses
The waiters whistling as the last bar closes
The song that Crosby sings
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The scent of smould'ring leaves, the wail of steamers
Two lovers on the street who walk like dreamers
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you",These Foolish Things,1994
Sonny Greenwich,"Why do robins sing in December
Long before the Springtime is due?
And even though it's snowing, violets are growing
I know why and so do you
Why do breezes sigh every evening whispering your name as they do?
And why have I the feeling stars are on my ceiling?
I know why and so do you
When you smile at me I hear gypsy violins
When you dance with me, I'm in heaven when the music begins
I can see the sun when it's raining, hiding every cloud from my view
And why do I see rainbows when you're in my arms?
I know why and so do you

Sonny Greer,"Frankie and Johnny were sweethearts
Oh, what a couple in love
Frankie was loyal to Johnny
Just as true as the stars above

He was her man
But he done her wrong

Frankie went down to the drugstore
Some ice cream she wanted to buy
The soda jerk told her that Johnny
Was making love to Nellie Bligh

He was her man
But he was doing her wrong

Now Frankie's dad was a policeman
She stole his old forty-four gun
Then back to the drugstore she beat it
Just as fast as she could run

After her man
Who was doing her wrong

Now Frankie peaked in on the party
She got a surprise when she saw
That Nellie and Johnny were making love
And sipping soda through a straw

He was her man
But he was doing her wrong

So Frankie flew into a tantrum
She whipped out that old forty-four
And her rootie-toot-boom, that gal did shoot
Right through that hardwood swinging door

She shot her man
'Cause he was doing her wrong

So bring on your crepe and your flowers
Bring on your rubber-tired hack
'Cause there's eight men to go to the graveyard
But only seven are coming back

She shot her man
'Cause he was doing her wrong

Now this is the end of my story
And this is the end of my song
Frankie is down in the jailhouse
And she cries the whole night long

But he was doing me wrong""",Frankie and Johnny,1999
