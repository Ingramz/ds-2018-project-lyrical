A victim of the curse of empathy
Her reward of compassion is to suffer

Still she loves me. This I can't believe!

True. I am the son of an angel
Maternally, not one woman compares

When you're lost. I'll be there soon
Far away, but of course near
When you're sad I am always here

Thank you from saving me from myself
Your compassion became its own hell
Unequivocally Beautiful inside and out

Home, in an ocean beneath the sun

Fame and fortune it had begun

So holier than thou art, all marine mammals friend
Change your evil ways now or with terror I strike
Why can't you do like we do, pay your way
'Round the blood
When it's on the table you won't know
Whence it came, I say

Curse the weak link, What's out
Come your down fall, Lights out
May your ship sink, Rainbow Warrior floats
No more, there are no Lights on
That obtrusive creep all, What's on

To the fields of concrete slabs, towers of
Stone. 'cross an ocean behind his stern

That nature is against them, with that all
Stands and falls

She's got luggage eyes and a roman nose
Her body is slung from side to side
Need a lift she said much obliged

She said my name's the liquid poetess
She unties her mouth
And her buckskin dress
She drinks from a bottle
Labelled tenderness
I'm in one hand in the other's a can

She puts me in the can
And smiles through the wall

Dressed in a bayleaf she's trying to hide

Reflections looked most better than all
Cared too much, hating hatred
Seeing things deformed and almost cold
Crying sadly, shielding gladly my eyes
From the ugly side of fat men seeing, almost
Thin men peeping, sleeping, looking, falling
Dizzy from their windows high

The men of magic thinking if evil
He was bringing sunless children
Seeing all the bad,
'cause beauty was too ugly
And faceless people
Wondered at the beautiful forms they had

Now the mirror's broken
I'm smiling, seeing good things
Yet despite foot splinters swirl in the air
Forever call him beauty
Children come at night time
Weird things blackening the fairest maiden's hair

And, Baby, you've been flying too high

It's all over town, you're chasing around
But I'm not gonna sit home and cry
Remember what goes up must come down
And, Baby, you've been flying too high

You ought to get your walkin' papers
But now it's too late
Because I know you too well
When you're through cuttin' capers
You break down my gate
To ring my front door bell

So go have your fling, and don't miss a thing
I'll see you down to earth by and by
Remember what goes up must come down
And, Baby, you've been flying too high",What Goes up Must Come Down,1996

She's alright with me
I said New Orleans woman
She's alright with me
That's my hometown I'm talking about

'Cause when she cooks
That good old Gumbo fillet
I'm happy as can be

I love my baby
I'm gonna tell you the reason why
Let you know the secret out

Yes I love my baby
Well, I'm gonna tell you the reason why
Never told you this before
'Cause there ain't a chance for a cutout
You've got to stay with me till the day I die

Swinging hard, jack, I now I can't lose

And this great big band, bringing up the rear

Known for bussing shots
Tyrese that's your man
Tell that cat beat it

In the fox hill mall tricking
My dogs think I'm flipping

In so many ways

Lately
Have I told you I love you
Lately
Have I told you you still mean the world to me
Lately
Have I told you I love you
I'll be your wishing well
Tell me what you want babe

Don't think twice of our love
I say these things because
I love you but it's hard to explain
And I'm hoping that you're feeling the same
You know that all of my
Feelings are inside
And verbally I tend to forget
How much I L-O-V-E U really means

Have I told you I love you

Can't take the bull what what cha going do

Forget the clones it's all bout me

You can't get with it so quit
You're illigit no doubt bout it word is bond
I'm lethal can't nothing get past me but weak son
I remain jiggy with the illiest flow

You tried to play me Shelene ain't having it

Now you brought light, brighter than summer days,
This time around I hope that it stays.

Nah, nah, no, no, no, no.

You need to let me know you're feeling the same,

It didn't take too long to fall in love so strong.
So maybe we should make it more than a fling.

Now I'm falling in love.
I say why, they say love comes by,
When you don't even expect it to.

And I'll be breaking all the rules if I let her get a piece of me.

Rollin' deep in the ""6"" Cartier on the Wrist
I like em' thick

I like dem girls in the top Bentley

Out the corner of my eye spot a shorty
Ice so bright baby lightin' up the party
She got the Prada fittin' right on her body
36-24 How could I let it pass me

This the type of flavor I like (flavor I like)

Tyrese,"Damn, take a ride, to my block
My block, 
That's right! Heh
F'real on my motherfucking block

They got a nigga
Shedding tears, reminiscing on my past fears
'Cause shit was hectic for me last year
It appears that I've been marked for death, my heartless breath
The underlying cause of my arrest, my life is stressed
And no rest forever weary, my eyes stay teary
For all the brothers that are buried in the cemetery
Shit is scary, how black on black crime legendary
But at times unnecessary, I'm getting worried
Teardrops and closed caskets, the three strikes law is drastic
And certain death for us ghetto bastards
What can we do when we're arrested, but open fire
Life in the pen ain't for me, 'cause I'd rather die
But don't cry through your despair
I wonder if the Lord still cares, for us niggas on welfare
And who cares if we survive
The only time they notice a nigga is when he's clutching on a four-five
My neighborhood ain't the same 
Cause all these little babies going crazy and they suffering in the game
And I swear it's like a trap
But I ain't given up on the hood, it's all good when I go back
Hoes show me love, niggas give me props
Forever hop 'cause it don't stop, on my block

Living life is but a dream
Hard times is all we see (on my block)
Every block is kinda mean
But on our block we still pray
But on our block we still pray

Now shit's constantly hot, on my block, it never fails to be gunshots
Can't explain a mother's pain, when her son drops
Black male slipping in hail when will we prevail
Fearing jail but crack sales got me living well
And the system's suicidal with this thug's Life
Staying strapped forever trapped in this drug life
God help me, 'cause I'm starving, can't get a job
So I resort to violent robberies, my life is hard
Can't sleep 'cause all the dirt make my heart hurt
Put in work and shed tears for my dead peers
Mislead from childhood where I went astray
Till this day I still pray for a better way
Can't help but feel hopeless and heartbroke
From the start I felt the racism 'cause I'm dark
Couldn't quit the bullshit make me represent
Hit the bar and played the star, everywhere I went
In my heart, I felt alone out here on my own
I close my eyes and picture home on my block

Living life is but a dream
Hard times is all we see (on my block)
Every block is kinda mean
But on our block we still pray
But on our block we still pray

And I can't help but wonder why, so many young kids had to die
Caught strays from AK's and the driveby
Swollen pride and homicide, don't coincide
Brothers cry for broken lives, mama come inside
'Cause our block is filled with danger
Used to be a close knit community but now we're all cold strangers
Time changes us to stone them crack pipes
All up and down the block exterminating black life
But I can't blame the dealers
My mama's welfare check has brought the next man chrome wheels
Shit's real, I know ya feel, my tragedy
A single mother with a problem child, daddy free
Hanging out picking up game, sipping cheap liquor
Gamin the hoochies hoping I can get to sleep with her
It's a man's world, staying strapped
Fantasies of a nigga living phat, but held back
Pipe dreams can make the night seem hopeless
Wide eyed and losing focus, on my block

Living life is but a dream
Hard times is all we see (on my block)
Every block is kinda mean
But on our block we still pray
But on our block we still pray

And block parties in the projects lasting way past daylight
A young nigga learned to break night
Used to play fight with my homies but they stuck in the pen
I send them ends, but it's tough on a friend, in my mind
I see the same motherfuckers balling
Alcohol will make a lazy nigga slip and fall, miss his call
I know the young niggas understand this
Growing up in this world where everything is scandalous
I reminisce on the fast times, past crimes
Trying to cop a slice of pizza with my last dime
Can't explain, just what attracts me to this dirty game
Gold chains, some extra change, and the street fame
And what's strange is everybody knows my name, swear they all know me
And lots of cash make a nigga change
I hit the green just to maintain, feeling pain
For all the niggas that I lost to the game from my block

Living life is but a dream
Hard times is all we see 

Rest in peace to all the motherfuckers who passed away
From all the blocks that I'm from
One-twelve street, 7th Avenue, New York, Uptown,u know what I'm sayin'?
183rd and Walt, my block, that's right
122nd and Morningside, my block, that's right
Decatur Avenue, Baltimore, my block, that's right
In the jungle of Marin City, that's my block, that's right
Los Angeles, that's my block too
Oakland, can't forget Oaktown, that's my block for sure
And all the other blocks around this motherfucker
Houston, Florida, St. Louis, Tennessee, Miami, Chicago

(I ain't mean to call you a bitch)
I'll never call you bitch again

Damn, gave my homey 90 days for domestic violence
I try to picture myself, in this position but remain silent
I get to thinkin' bout this shit, we been through
We close like kin but you remain my friend too
This life of sin, done got the both of us in trouble
But you always stay down for a nigga, so that's why I love you
Reminiscin' needin' tissues, fightin' over childish issues
Swear I can't live with you but without you every day I miss you
When we roll you hold my pistol, my gangsta bitch-ich
You always in the mood for love, that's why I'm sleepin' with you
Though not the man of your dreams, my plan and schemes
To be rich like a king, and live my life, trouble free
I see yesterday I called you names, and played games on yo' mind
I promise that I'll change in time

I wake up early in the mornin', at the crack of dawn
Nigga still tired so I'm yawnin', and now I'm gone
Tryin' to get my money on strong, so an early riser
Out before them other guys, that's the way to profit every time
Can't get too close, my enemies, they see ghosts, they envy me
Plus we been beefin' with the east coast, with casualties
Got stopped in traffic, had a warrant, so they gaffled me
But while I'm gone, watch my business, and my back for me
My enemies think they got me crossed, they ain't knowin'
Ain't no love for player haters where you cowards goin'
You paid bail, got me out of jail, home again
I promise not to leave you on your own again
Cristal corks are popped, romantic, thoughts are dropped
It's so frantic but don't panic 'cause we crossed the top
I found a partner and a rider, a woman and friend
I swear I'll never call you bitch again, believe me

We came, too far
To throw it all away

We came, way too far pretty baby
To throw it all away, throw it all away

I know, I know
All that is dead though, I'm changed, I'm tellin you.
I swear I'll never call you bitch again believe me 
I know what time it is, gotta give a nigga time
To grow up you know what I'm sayin? That was way back then
I swear I'll never call you bitch again

I'm never gonna call you, a bitch again

Keep yo' head up, 'cause things are gettin' better
My cellmates shed tears off yo' last love letter
Told 'em you would find a friend so keep yo' eyes peeled
Sorry if I cuss but it's the suffering that I feel
Who can I trust and if I bust will she snitch
Even though you ain't the type to trip
Sorry if I called you bitch
You showed me the definition of feminine
The difference between a pack of bitches and black women
I see the boss for the third time, hope to see you soon
Pictures of us kissin' in the living room, in the nude
Thanks for bein' there, much more than a friend

Tyrese,"I think your wrong, you think your right
And all that equals up to is a fight
Let's compromise before we go to bed tonight
'Cause if the fight don't die before the sun rise
We may wake up on the wrong side
Let's not go to bed mad tonight

Time is ticking, my eyes are getting heavy
But I know we gotta squash this
Before it was popping, it's time for dropping
Copping attitudes right now

Nothings, nothing 'cause this ain't nothing
Don't you know that I love you?
So start to stopping, think about it
You'll see it's stupid

Argue about things so critical
And you heated over nothing and just hang up the phone
I want, wanna talk in the mood
See we need a resolution like that Aaliyah song

I think your wrong, you think your right
And all that equals up to is a fight
Let's compromise before we go to bed tonight
'Cause if the fight don't die before the sun rise
We may wake up on the wrong side
Let's not go to bed mad tonight

What time is it? I'm not on a mission
To stay up with you all night
It makes me so sick to my stomach
Every time we argue and fight

I mean it girl, my head gets lite, it just ain't right
I'm fed right up, please
It's 2:15 in the morning
There is no need

Argue about things so critical
And you heated over nothing and just hang up the phone
I want, wanna talk in the mood
See we need a resolution like that Aaliyah song

I think your wrong, you think your right
And all that equals up to is a fight
Let's compromise before we go to bed tonight
'Cause if the fight don't die before the sun rise
We may wake up on the wrong side
Let's not go to bed mad tonight

I'm not trying to be mad at you
Why you make me wanna not fool with you?
Can't you see I'm tired girl?
Besides the fact it's a quarter past two
A girl like me got things to do
So let's see each others point of view

I think your wrong, you think your right
And all that equals up to is a fight
Let's compromise before we go to bed tonight
'Cause if the fight don't die before the sun rise
We may wake up on the wrong side
Let's not go to bed mad tonight

I think your wrong, you think your right
And all that equals up to is a fight
Let's compromise before we go to bed tonight
'Cause if the fight don't die before the sun rise
We may wake up on the wrong side
Let's not go to bed mad tonight

I just wanna love you baby
I place no one above you baby
You're the only one for me
Let's not argue my baby

Everything you want and need
And my baby come and take my hand
I got you baby
Let me be the man you want in your life baby
",Go to Bed Mad,2003
Tyrese,"I said a hip hop the hippie the hippie
To the hip hip hop, a you don't stop
The rock it to the bang bang boogie
Say up jumped the boogie
To the rhythm of the boogie, the beat

Now what you hear is not a test
I'm rappin' to the beat
And me, the groove, and my friends
Are gonna try to move your feet

See I am Wonder Mike and I like to say hello
To the black, to the white,
The red, and the brown, the purple and yellow
But first I gotta bang bang the boogie to the boogie
Say up jump the boogie to the bang bang boogie
Let's rock, you don't stop
Rock the riddle that will make your body rock

Well so far you've heard my voice
But I brought two friends along
And next on the mike is my man Hank
Come on, Hank, sing that song

Check it out
To the rhythm of the boogie da bang bang da bong
Well, I'm imp the dimp the ladies pimp
The women fight for my delight
But I'm the grandmaster with the three mcs
That shock the house for the young ladies
And when you come inside, into the front
You do the freak, spank, and do the bump
And when the sucker mcs try to prove a point
We're treacherous trio, we're the serious joint
A from sun to sun and from day to day
I sit down and write a brand new rhyme
Because they say that miracles never cease
I've created a devastating masterpiece
I'm gonna rock the mike til you can't resist
Everybody, I say it goes like this
Well I was comin' home late one dark afternoon
A reporter stopped me for a interview
She said she's heard stories and she's heard fables
That I'm vicious on the mike and the turntables
This young reporter I did adore
So I rocked a vicious rhyme like I never did before
She said damn fly guy I'm in love with you
The Casanova legend must have been true
I said by the way baby what's your name
Said I go by the name of Lois Lane
And you could be my boyfriend you surely can
Just let me quit my boyfriend called superman
I said he's a fairy I do suppose
Flyin' through the air in pantyhose
He may be very sexy or even cute
But he looks like a sucker in a blue and red suit
I said you need a man who's got finesse
And his whole name across his chest
He may be able to fly all through the night
But can he rock a party til the early light
He can't satisfy you with his little worm
But I can bust you out with my super sperm
I go do it, I go do it, I go do it, do it , do it
An I'm here and I'm there
I'm big bang Hank, I'm everywhere
Just throw your hands up in the air
And party hardy like you just don't care
Let's do it don't stop
Why'all a tick a tock why'all you don't stop
Go hotel, motel what you gonna do today (say what)
I'm gonna get a fly girl
Gonna get some spank drive off in a def OJ
Everybody go hotel, motel Holiday Inn
You say if your girl starts actin' up
Then you take her friend
I say skip, dive, what can I say
I can't fit em all inside my OJ
So I just take half and bust them out
I give the rest to Master Gee
So he could shock the house


I said m-a-s, t-e-are, a g with a double e
I said I go by the unforgettable name
Of the man they call the master gee
Well, my name is known all over the world
By all the foxy ladies and the pretty girls
I'm goin' down in history
As the baddest rapper there could ever be
Now I'm feelin' the highs and ya feelin' the lows
The beat starts gettin' into your toes
Ya start poppin' ya fingers and stompin' your feet
And movin' your body while you're sittin' in your seat
And the damn ya start doin' the freak
I said damn, right outta your seat
Then ya throw your hands high in the air
Ya rockin' to the rhythm, shake your derriere
Ya rockin' to the beat without a care
With the sureshot MC's for the affair
Now, I'm not as tall as the rest of the gang
But I rap to the beat just the same
I dot a little face and a pair of brown eyes
All I'm here to do ladies is hypnotize
Singin on n n on n on n on
The beat don't stop until the break of dawn
Singin on n n on n on on n on
Like a hot buttered a
Pop da pop da pop dibbie dibbie
Pop da pop pop ya don't dare stop
Come alive y'all gimme what ya got
I guess by now you can take a hunch
And find that I am the baby of the bunch
But that's okay I still keep in stride
Cause all I'm here to do is just wiggle your behind
Singin on n n on n on n on
The beat don't stop until the break of dawn
Singin on n n on n on on n on
Rock rock y'all throw it on the floor
I'm gonna freak ya here I'm gonna freak ya there
I'm gonna move you outta this atmosphere
Cause I'm one of a kind and I'll shock your mind
Ill put t-t-tickets in your behind
I said one, two, three, four, come on girls get on the floor
A-come alive, y'all a-gimme what ya got
Cause I'm guaranteed to make you rock
I said one, two, three, four
Tell me Wonder Mike what are you waitin for?

I said a hip hop the hippie to the hippie
The hip hip hop, a you don't stop
The rock it to the bang bang boogie
Say up jumped the boogie
To the rhythm of the boogie, the beat
Skiddlee beebop a we rock a scoobie doo
And guess what America we love you
Cause ya rock and ya roll with so much soul
You could rock till you're a hundred and one years old
I don't mean to brag I don't mean to boast
But we like hot butter on our breakfast toast
Rock it up baby bubbah
Baby bubbah to the boogie da bang bang da boogie
To the beat, beat, its so unique
Come on everybody and dance to the beat




I said a hip hop the hippie the hippie
To the hip hip hop, a you don't stop
Rock it out baby bubbah to the boogie da bang bang
The boogie to the boogie da beat
I said I can't wait til the end of the week
When I'm rappin to the rhythm of a groovy beat
And attempt to raise your body heat
Just blow your mind so that you can't speak
And do a thing but a rock and shuffle your feet
And let it change up to a dance called the freak
And when ya finally do come in to your rhythmic beat
Rest a little while so ya don't get weak
I know a man named hank
He has more rhymes than a serious bank
So come on hank sing that song
To the rhythm of the boogie da bang bang da bong
Well, I'm imp the dimp the ladies pimp
The women fight for my delight
But I'm the grandmaster with the three mcs
That shock the house for the young ladies

So I just take half and bust them out
I give the rest to master gee
So he could shock the house
It was twelve o'clock one Friday night
I was rockin to the beat and feelin all right
Everybody was dancin on the floor
Doin all the things they never did before
And then this fly fly girl with a sexy lean
She came into the bar, she came into the scene
As she traveled deeper inside the room
All the fellas checked out her white sasoons
She came up to the table, looked into my eyes
Then she turned around and shook her behind
So I said to myself, its time for me to release
My vicious rhyme I call my masterpiece
And now people in the house this is just for you
A little rap to make you boogaloo
Now the group ya hear is called phase two
And let me tell ya somethin we're a helluva crew
Once a week we're on the street
Just a-cuttin' the jams and making it free
For you to party ya got to have the movies
So we'll get right down and give you the groove
For you to dance you gotta get hype
So we'll get right down for you tonight
Now the system's on and the girls are there
Ya definitely have a rockin affair
But let me tell ya somethin there's still one fact
That to have a party ya got to have a rap
So when the party's over you're makin it home
And tryin to sleep before the break of dawn
And while ya sleepin ya start to dream
And thinkin how ya danced on the disco scene
My name appears in your mind
Yeah, a name you know that was right on time
It was phase two just a doin a do
Rockin ya down cause ya know we could
To the rhythm of the beat that makes ya freak
Come alive girls get on your feet
To the rhythm of the beat to the beat the beat
To the double beat beat that it makes ya freak
To the rhythm of the beat that says ya go on
On n on into the break of dawn
Now I got a man comin on right now
He's guaranteed to throw down
He goes by the name of wonder mike
Come on wonder mike do what ya like
Like a can of beer that's sweeter than honey
Like a millionaire that has no money
Like a rainy day that is not wet
Like a gamblin fiend that does not bet
Like dracula with out his fangs
Like the boogie to the boogie without the boogie bang
Like collard greens that don't taste good
Like a tree that's not made out of wood
Like goin up and not comin down
Is just like the beat without the sound no sound
To the beat beat, ya do the freak
Everybody just rock and dance to the beat

Have you ever went over a friend's house to eat
And the food just ain't no good
I mean the macaroni's soggy, the peas are mushed
And the chicken tastes like wood
So you try to play it off like you think you can
By sayin' that you're full and then
Your friend says momma he's just being polite
He ain't finished uh uh that's bull
So your heart starts pumpin' and you think of a lie
And you say that you already ate
And your friend says man there's plenty of food
So you pile some more on your plate
While the stinky foods steamin'
Your mind starts to dreamin'
Of the moment that it's time to leave
And then you look at your plate
And your chickens slowly rottin'
Into something that looks like cheese
Oh so you say that's it I got to leave this place
I don't care what these people think
I'm just sittin' here makin' myself nauseous
With this ugly food that stinks
So you bust out the door while its still closed
Still sick from the food you ate
And then you run to the store for quick relief
From a bottle of Kaopectate
And then you call your friend two weeks later
To see how he has been
And he says I understand about the food
Baby bubbah but we're still friends
With a hip hop the hippie to the hippie
The hip hip a hop a you don't stop the rockin
To the bang bang boogie
Say up jump the boogie
To the rhythm of the boogie the beat",Rapper's Delight,2003

Ran til my And 1's had holes in the soles
I had 3 silk shirts, 2 pairs of jebose
Spent the night at boo's house, we was sharin' his clothes
Moms left me out in the cold
Worst that that my man took 5 shots and ain't lose his soul
I was livin with a blind man's vision
And no matter how hard I tried, I could never see prison
And to all my dead homies, we don't pour rout liquor
We just poke our chests out, and say we miss ya niggas
We was scared of gang bangers, walked to school in groups
Argued who was the best MC, Ice Cube or Snoop

Tyrese,"Hey, baby wake up
What happened last night, damn

Started off with a bottle of Patrãn
And it ended up with breakfast in bed
Just enough to turn your freaky on
And I'm trippin' off the things you said

It's been messin' with my sleep
Got me up at the crack of dawn
Lookin' 'round my room, smellin' your perfume
Reaching for your hair but you're gone

Your sex got me so hot, I can't come down
Even if I wanted to
Your neck, your back, I'm workin' my way down
It's what you make me do

I think I want another morning after
It plays over in my head every time I make my bed
I'm looking forward to the morning after
It's get me through with the day when I think about the way

You get that dirty little look on your face
And tell me that you're ready for the trip that we 'bout to take
Oh, baby girl
I just gotta ask ya, can I get another morning after?

Reminiscing how it all went down
Wish I could play it like a DVD
Got so wet a nigga almost drowned
But then you came and rescued me

Your sex got me so hot, I can't come down
Even if I wanted to
Your neck, your back, I'm workin' my way down
It's what you make me do

I think I want another morning after
Ohh, it plays over in my head every time I make my bed
I'm looking forward to the morning after
Oh, it's get me through with the day when I think about the way

You get that dirty little look on your face
And tell me that you're ready for the trip that we 'bout to take
Oh, baby girl
Let me ask you this, girl, can I get another morning
Another morning after?

Baby can you spend the night with me?
I'm wakin' up before you do to watch you sleep
I'mma watch you sleep baby, yeah, yeah

Baby can you spend the night with me?
Can you spend the night with me my baby?
I'm wakin' up before you do to watch you sleep
I wanna make sweet love to you

I think I want another morning after
I'm looking forward to the morning after

You get that dirty little look on your face
And tell me that you're ready for the trip that we 'bout to take
Oh, baby girl
Can I get another morning, another morning after?

Baby can you spend the night with me?
Can I get another morning, morning after?
I'm wakin' up before you do to watch you sleep
Can I get another morning, morning after?

Baby can you spend the night with me?
Can I get another morning, morning after?

I need you to get up outta here

I've been tryin' to think of what to say to make yo' ass listen
But nah, every time I bring up the subject
You comin' back at me talkin' R & B shit

Cause I know hip-hop, is a dangerous game
I love hip-hop, but I don't want that thing
All my concerts, got girls in the audience
I don't want nobody tryin' to take my life and shit

Yeah right, you know you wanna get back on the mic
Cause every time you on stage singin' you cuffin' the mic
Tellin' your fans to put they hands in the motherfuckin' air
And wave 'em side to side like they just don't care

But the rap game to me seems shady
All them dis records will probably drive me crazy
All the ladies give me love when I go to club
I don't wanna have to keep my eyes out for no thugs

Aight, I admit it, the rap game's a little shady
But they ain't gon' ever dance in the club to songs like ""Sweet Lady""
I see you pop bottles with top models and then you go to the floor
You dance to e'rybody's shit but yours

Mm, nigga you startin' to piss me off
Won't you climb back in your box, Black-Ty get lost
I can't believe you send that 'bout my song ""Sweet Lady""
Please leave me alone, you about to drive me crazy

Man you trippin, it's way cheaper to make a rap album
Ten to fifteen thou', you payin' 100 thou' per track
And you don't wanna rap nigga?
Put out two or three albums and go platinum nigga? Damn

Mmm, man I'm not listenin' to you
I love R & B, this is what I do
R & B's the reason that I'm drivin' that Bentley
House on the hill, bank account got plenty
So nigga don't talk to me, about R & B
When every rap nigga out tryin' to sing

Yeah that's true, but I ain't gon' ever do that shit
I'ma call a R & B nigga to sing that shit
Matter of fact think about it, me and you can be on the same record
Me on the verses, and you can sing the hooks and shit
Man, I guarantee we'll win a Grammy with that
That's on me, we'll shake up the industry with that

Probably so, but no, I don't wanna do a song with'chu
Cause I probably never ever get along with'chu

Call 'em, I don't give a fuck, we from Watts, remember?

Why is that?

'Cause ain't no money in the music industry, one!

Yeah the nigga's Hollywood, he's gone
Like I was sayin', I just wanna get at you about some business homie

Oh man I don't wanna talk to you about this shit no more
Please get out of my vocal booth and walk out the door
Who do you think you are talkin' to me?
I'm a singer and all my fans love me

I ain't tryin' to stop you from singin' R & B
I been in a little box for 12 years, I just wanna breathe
Let me out please, I guarantee
That everybody in this industry gon' wanna do a song with me

Aw damn, let me think about it 
Aw damn, I'm done thinkin' about it
Hell no, hell no
I don't know if I'm ready to let you out (let you out)

You might be cursin and callin women out they names
It might be disrespectful to my whole fanbase

Nah man, I got a whole lot of respect for these hoes
I'm just fuckin' with you nigga, for real it's a joke [chuckles]

Nah man, I don't really think this shit is real funny
Because of my fans I made a whole lot of money

You motherfuckers, ain't ready

Sticks and stones may, break my bones but
Words will never hurt, it won't work
So throw dirt on a nigga, and watch me brush my shoulders off
I ain't soft or lost, I'm C.E.O. the boss
Think about it, he done went from this and that and back
and ain't tryin' to rap, man we ain't havin' that
Says who, you? You ain't got a clue what I been through
Your ? done saught on me dude
We used to be cool when I was on the R & B side
Rap niggas are singin', I figured I'd give it a try
Can't be mad, you niggas never called me for a hook
The industry shook, I'm Black-Ty, open the books
Steady reppin the block, niggas know I'm from Watts
I'm keepin' it hot, the West Coast move won't stop
Straight out the do' for sho', got plenty collabo's
You niggas ain't ready for the wrath, don't make me laugh
I been doin this rap shit for years
Blood, sweat and tears, no fears
So let me be clear, I got medicine for your ears
And nah Dre didn't do it, shit is still how I bounce to it

Please stay right by my side
Two can be one
The righteous way to go
Been a while but no
I'll believe if I'm told so
You're second to none

The question is what do I know about love
They ask me all the time do I know about love
Naturally I say yes but I don't know shit
'cause if I did I wouldn't be in and out of relationships
Why? Do I get caught up in eye candy
A few days I pound she ain't nowhere to be found
Everyday I pull so many dimes
I need to change my middle name to one line
'cause I got so many one liners
I try to tell her I was ready to go all the way
But she couldn't be patient with me
And now look at the end result
She ain't here to get these roses I brought
But I'ma keep my self-esteem up
And keep looking for some real love
You know its true what they say
Love's as precious as a rose
Will I ever find a rose I don't know

It's been a miracle from what you've done
Please stay right by my side
Two can be one
The righteous way to go
Been a while but no
I'll believe if I'm told so
You're second to none

I seen it coming way before we got here
You want me to put you over my whole career
My career was here first and its here to stay
Don't trip girl you're still a prior life and
Movie sets, rhyming, singing, and world tours
If I ain't got a rose in my life then what's it all for
You think I wanna be in private jets
Laid up in five star hotels by myself
Nope I want a rose to share with
The blessing of a backbone but I can't stay alone
I come home to a home cooked meal
A manicure pedicure without seeing a bill
Am I describing you I don't know
I don't wanna spend the rest of my life living single
Patience is a virtue that's the way that it goes
The question is will I find my rose is that you

It's been a miracle from what you've done
Please stay right by my side
Two can be one
The righteous way to go
Been a while but no
I'll believe if I'm told so
You're second to none

My moms taught me not to wear emotions on my sleeves
So when I leave please believe I'ma leave man
I'm not a charity case
But you might have to donate some love tips and show me the way
'cause if I really knew it all
You think y'all would have to talk to me about how to love and all
Naw I'd be on top of the world
At twenty seven with a wife, pregnant, and white picket fences and shit
It's cool I'ma get there soon
Running around in the yard having fun with my little ones
Thinking to myself I had my share
There's gonna be women everywhere
Not like the one I got here
Independent, fine as hell and got her own career
And if I ever needed her
She'll be right there
Is that you damn

I don't know what else to say man
I feel like I got something
But at the same time I don't
It's lonely out here
You can have all the money in the world
That shit don't matter
You know what I'm saying
When you broke you want money
And when you get money
You just want a girl to lay up with
And chill and relax and shit

[Verse 1: Keith Murray]
Keith Murray, the lyrical hannibal floe cannibal
Animalistic tough guy man handle you
I came into this b*tch my style hardcore
Then I heard a hater say he ain't fire no more!
What?! That was me standin on your block with the razor blade
In my mouth back when hip hop was hip hop
For those who don't know or forget
To make y'all happy with Mary J. who Puff came to get (Me)
Then who called for Total to make y'all see (Me)
Then who he called again for Special Delivery (That a be me)
There's nothin you could tell me, I rocked every hole in the wall
Then arena to arena with R. Kelly
Who made you feel beautiful while gettin lifted (Me)
I rocked bells with L you must be stupid
I don't need no permission, to do what I do
Come through and show the whole world how I do

That's why your lovin me cause can't nobody do it better (Can't nobody)

I'm gonna be right here to get your sh*t together (*Right here, yo!)

[Verse 2: Keith Murray]
And who you know get out of jail and get them figures
Get back into the game like f**k the system
Hit the studio and bless y'all with Fatty Girl
Who got 'em sayin ba donk a donk around the world
Now I'm hearin I got anger issues on the street
The only anger I got, is when I'm f**kin up a E beat
Keep runnin your lips and I'm a have you dancin like the crips
Turn your six pack to some barbeque rib tips
Mother hot damn this man jam like a phone
And plus the sh*t I get more draws than a dresser 
When I flow, there's no one deafer
Make you make the ugly face like Lamont's Aunt Ester
You can't stealth me my tank is too healthy
Even negative situations help me
When E lace the beat, and me and Ty bust one
Trust son that's money in the bank like a trust fund

[Verse 3: Keith Murray]
Yo! Keith Murray is your (?) MC Ultra
With the sickest comeback like ni**a I told ya
Honeys sweat me like conversation, mind affiliation
House niggas like the Fannie Mae Foundation
The K don't play f**k around touche' and toupee
What you say get done away like Faye
I rhyme flagrant you sweeter than a sugar fragrance
Ignoramus, blow your brains out on a pavement 
The game we been milkin for awhile like a green cow
You seregant MC, that ain't your style
Metaphors dawn on you in time like revelations
Battlin Keith, self mutilation
Let it be sensible, I'll make you invisible
Ni**as can't see me the flow is invincible
My style royalty like residuals
You subjectable, hospitable y'all niggas is despicable

You ain't fuck with me, hehehe
I swear I'll never call you bitch again (All I just wanna say is um, if I fuckin' apologized)
I swear I'll never call you bitch again (I ain't mean to call you a bitch)
I'll never call you bitch again

Damn, gave my homey 90 days for domestic violence
I try to picture myself, in this position but remain silent
I get to thinkin bout this shit, we been through
We close like kin but you remain my friend to
This life of sin, done got the both of us in trouble
But you always stay down for a nigga, so that's why I love you
Reminiscin' needin' tissues, fightin over childish issues
Swear I can't live wit' you but without you every day I miss you
When we roll you hold my pistol, my gangsta bitch-ich
You always in the mood for love, that's why I'm sleepin' wit' you
Though not the man of your dreams, my plan and schemes
To be rich like a king, and live my life, trouble free
I see yesterday I called you names, and played games on yo' mind
I promise that I'll change in time
It's a complicated world, so girl just be a friend
I swear I'll never call you bitch again (and that's my word)

We came, too far,
To throw it all away (I swear I'll never call you bitch again, believe me)
We came.. Way too far pretty baby
To throw it all away, throw it all away (I swear I'll never call you bitch again, hey)

I wake up early in the mornin', at the crack of dawn
Nigga still tired so I'm yawnin', and now I'm gone
Tryin' to get my money on strong, so an early riser
Out befo' them other guys, that's the way to profit every time
Can't get too close, my enemies, they see ghosts, they envy me
Plus we been beefin' with the East coast, with casualties
Got stopped in traffic, had a warrant, so they gaffled me
But while I'm gone, watch my business, and my back for me
My enemies think they got me crossed, they ain't knowin'
Ain't no love for player haters where you cowards goin'
You paid bail, got me out of jail, home again
I promise not to leave you on your own again
Cristal corks are popped, romantic, thoughts are dropped
It's so frantic but don't panic cause we crossed the top
I found a partner and a rider, a woman and friend
I swear I'll never call you bitch again, believe me

We came, too far,
To throw it all away (I swear I'll never call you bitch again, believe me)
We came.. Way too far pretty baby
To throw it all away, throw it all away (I swear I'll never call you bitch again, hey)

I know, I know
All that is dead though, I'm changed, I'm tellin you..
I know what time it is, gotta give a nigga time
To grow up ya' know what I'm sayin'? That was way back then

You're my nigga, my best friend
Never gonna call you a bitch again
Yea yea yea, oh

Witness the evil men do, all this shit I been through
Never meant to hurt you, can we make this work boo?
I know you been feelin pain, things are not the same
""Waitin to Exhale"" while I'm sittin in the county jail
Keep yo' head up, cause things are gettin better
My cellmates shed tears off yo' last love letter
Told 'em you would find a friend so keep yo' eyes peeled
Sorry if I cuss but it's the suffering that I feel
Who can I trust and if I bust will she snitch
Even though you ain't the type to trip, sorry if I called you bitch
You showed me the definition of feminine
The difference between a pack of bitches and black women
I see the boss for the third time, hope to see you soon
Pictures of us kissin in the living room, in the nude
Thanks for bein there, much more than a friend
I swear I'll never call you bitch again, believe me

We came, too far,
To throw it all away (I swear I'll never call you bitch again, believe me)
We came.. Way too far pretty baby
To throw it all away, throw it all away (I swear I'll never call you bitch again, hey)

We came, too far,

Tied up and cut, garage hit, whatchu know about it

Tyrese,"I never thought the sun would shine my way
All I've known is empty promises and pain
I need a way out or some type of escape
So I take refuge in this place

Even though the road to glory seems long
The fire in me could win a marathon
Believe there's nothing you can't overcome

If you dream, then you can do anything
If you dream, you're halfway to destiny
If you dream, dream the impossible
If you dream, cause a dream's unstoppable

I could've gave up a long time ago
Though the door I need to get through will always close

Storms and Rain everywhere I go
But I don't give up cause I know

Even if they say you just can't win
Believe you can go where you've never been
And you can fly high with the strength of all your friends

If you dream, then you can do anything
If you dream, you're halfway to destiny
If you dream, dream the impossible
If you dream,
cause a dream's unstoppable

Dream
That you can fly,
Dream
That you can climb
Dream
A mountain, all you gotta do is just
Dream
That you can win,
Dream
With Confidence
Dream
To the very end cause dreamers become champions
Dream
Until it's real,
Dream,
Don't let them kill your
Dream
The fight still is in you, all you gotta do is
Dream,
Just keep the faith,
Dream,
Don't ever break
Don't let it slip away cause all you gotta do

Even though the road to glory seems long
The fire in me could win a marathon
Believe there's nothing you can't overcome

Tyrese,"Girl, you make me wanna get you pregnant
Girl, you make me wanna get you pregnant
Lay your body down and get you pregnant (knock you up)
Pregnant (knock you up)

Now usually I leave the club with a girl who has a man
And take her to a hotel for just a one night stand
See, I'm a playa so I ain't tryna take her on no dates
But much like my Patron, man, I'm just tryna take it straight

Until I met this girl in the club with an unbelievable booty
The sweetest girl in the world and I mean it and on top of that she's a cutie
I ain't seen nothin' like her around here in a while
And if I had a girl she'd be the one to bear my child

Tellin' myself I'm a playa so I keep tryna shake it off
But I keep on seein' this big old house with a picket fence and a dog
Never felt nothin' like this, she's more than a mistress
I'm 'bout to handle my business then put that girl in my kitchen

Girl, you make me wanna get you pregnant (uh, that's what I told her)
Girl, you make me wanna get you pregnant
Lay your body down and get you pregnant (knock you up)
Pregnant (knock you up)

All the pretty ladies please line up right next to me
How would you like to go on a little trip with your boy Tyrese
Raise your hand if you want me to fulfill your fantasies
I can have you co-starrin' in one of my movies

Tell me what your name is, I can make you famous
We can pop champagne and get right down to sexin'
Now I ain't got nothin' to do, tonight I got away for my crew
I just wanna put some in you and I can tell that you want it too

And I'm ready, babe and you're ready, babe
So come on ladies let's get up out of this club
Kel's dreamin', Rese's after party come on fuck with us

Girl, you make me wanna get you pregnant (you make me wanna)
Girl, you make me wanna get you pregnant (get you pregnant)
Lay your body down and get you pregnant
Knock you up, pregnant, knock you up

Ooh, this song has got me hungry, baby, baby
So tell me that you want me, baby, baby
And girl, I'll love you 'til the sun shines
And girl, I promise I will make you my mine

Around the world in and out of clubs hangin' with chicks
And I don't see nothin' wrong with havin' a kid
Sounds like heaven's callin' us
And girl, well, it's about makin' love

If you choose me I guarantee
That the rest of your life would be man drama free
I think both of us should leave this club
And get somewhere alone with me
Where there's no phones to ring and plant this magic seed

Girl, you make me wanna get you pregnant (you make me wanna)
Girl, you make me wanna get you pregnant (get you pregnant)
Lay your body down and get you pregnant (knock you up)
Pregnant (knock you up)

Your house, my house don't matter, heat it up
Your city, my city don't matter, give it up
Somethin' about being with you make me wanna, baby
Put them pills on chill and girl give me my baby

You can play all you want but I know you feel it too
For 3 weeks you been talkin' about extra bedrooms
In New York meetin' with the realtor
There somethin' you wanna tell me, just say it, I'll pay it

Oh girl, I'ma take care of you
And I'ma still hold you like we brand new
So don't get it twisted for 30 somethin' weeks
I'm still gon' hit it and baby sit it, baby sit it

Girl, you make me wanna get you pregnant (you make me wanna)
Girl, you make me wanna get you pregnant (pregnant)
Lay your body down and get you pregnant (knock you up)
Pregnant (knock you up)

Take you out to eat uh-uh
Wine and dine uh-uh
Shoppin' spree, uh-uh
You sexin' me uh huh
See, I'm not cheap
Or selfish babe (no ah)
Girl, I'm just thurstin' (no ha)
For that booty, babe

And it's all your fault, baby, you look so good
It's all your fault that it feels like wood
And you look so bored up in this club so let's go
We can hop in the Lamborghini, roll to my big home

Shorty let's go crazy, let's make a lil' Kelly
Baby, I got goodies and I want you to have some (have some)
All I ask that you let me explore your secret garden

Oh, the summer can in the middle of the winter
And all my nightmares became a dream come true
Then suddenly my pool became an ocean
No sooner then I laid… my eyes on you
And I have never seen wings like that
Never seen a smile like that
I’ve seen the light but never ever bright as that
You blind me with love, am I going crazy?
But is this just a dream, cause

I just saw an angel, an angel on earth
Right before my very eyes
I just saw an angel, an angel on earth
And it was like a vision coming from the sky
I just saw an angel, an angel on earth
She held my hand and whispered to me, whoa
I just saw an angel, an angel on earth
Nothing compares to what you are

A sad end became happy ever after
And a sad song turned into a summer joy
When the light is on to me, was going dim …
You showed her what the candle burn boy
And I have never seen wings like that
Never seen a smile like that
I’ve seen the light but never ever bright as that
You blind me with love, am I going crazy?
But is this just a dream, cause

I just saw an angel, an angel on earth
Standing right before my very eyes

It was like a vision coming from the sky
I just saw an angel, an angel on earth
He held my hand and whispered to me, whoa
I just saw an angel, an angel on earth
Nothing compares to what you are

And it feels so good that I found my angel next to me
That I just gotta tell somebody
About my new discovery
And how I’m touched by an angel, touched by an angel
Touched by an angel
Girl it feels like I’m
I’m touched by an angel, touched by an angel
Touched by an angel

I just saw an angel, an angel on earth

I just saw an angel, an angel on earth

‘Cause I come to you more than I give back
Why am I on my knees prayin' yet again
Asking for more and more and more
Without recognizing the blessings I’ve already received
So now I say to you Father God, thank you
People are inspired by your transparency
Your walk is way more inspiring than your talk
Walk

I ask God for clarity so that He can reveal things to you that you would
never be able to see with your own eyes
God will never give you something somebody else is supposed to have
So your jealousy your envy and insecurities about somebody’s else’s blessings
Should ? because it ain’t jewels
Walk
I bet everything on the wedding ring
I’m married to God so therefore our marriage is work in progress
Faith is climbing invisible stairs
I pray that God blesses to find comfort and discomfort
Give me the strength to walk until the unfamiliar
We should always expect the things that you accept from me
If I accept your disrespect then it’s expected to you to continue walk
If I make you uncomfortable with my bottle of wine don’t cross it
You can often tell how far your life and career will go
Based on the fire people you spin the most time
So therefore i am a direct reflection of my surroundings
Yes, I used to be ? people say Tyrese you’ve changed

Come a little bit closer babe, let me feel it
Your body feels so soft against my skin
There’s nothing left to do but let me in it
Once I get you in my bed
Girl you wanna go and tell all your friends
'Cause I’m about to give you bragging rights to everything we did last night

I like the way you bite your lip when I, when I hit that spot
Scratches on my back, they’re showing what it is right now
And I don’t want it to stop
When we’re making love
When we make love, oh baby
Every move you make it feels so right
I don’t ever want it to end baby
How bout we make it last all night, you can be my forever lady

Girl you going crazy, screaming my name right now
'Cause I’m hitting that spot
Bed is shakin', your knees is grazing, you know what it is right now
And I don’t want it to stop

When we’re making love
Tonight let’s wake up the neighbors baby
When we make love, oh baby

Girl I wanna give you all of me
So don’t obey, just let yourself go
Let your love rain down on me
Feeling so good I have you begging for more

When we’re making love
Girl when you scream my name it let’s me know, it let’s me know I’m doing my thing
When we make love
I don’t wanna hold back baby, I don’t wanna hold back baby
When we make love
Let your body on mine
When we make love

I ain’t complaining 'cause I like em up there, like that",When We Make Love,2015
Tyrese,"Someone call a doctor, hurry please
There’s an empty space where my heart’s supposed to be
'Cause my girl left and she took it with her
So I’ll stop at nothing to get her
And I don’t have much time left
It’s like I just took my last breath

The room is dark and the temperature is getting low
The doctor said I’m suffering from a lack of love
Come back 'cause I don’t wanna fall apart

I can’t live without my heart
No, I can’t leave without my heart
Now you got me tripping 'cause
I give you life support in your time on need
So how could you turn around and pull the plug on me
You’re the only thing I ever knew about love

Girl I can’t live without you
Mistakes are had but my blood pressure’s getting low
My body seems to get weaker every time you go
I risk my life baby just to save us
'Cause I don’t stand a chance if I’m not with ya
And I know it’s my fault but I’m not prepared to take this loss

The room is dark and the temperature is getting low
The doctor said I’m suffering from a lack of love
So come back 'cause I 'm about to fall apart

I can’t live without my heart
I can’t leave without my heart
Now you got me tripping 'cause
I give you life support in your time on need
So how could you turn around and pull the plug on me
You’re the only thing I ever knew about love

Two fingers on my neck tryna find my pulse
And now I’m struggling to breathe 'cause the pain done collapsed my lungs
I know one day that we all gotta leave from here
But I’m way too young and my love’s not done
Shock me back to life and give me another try
I can’t live without my heart
No I can’t live without you",Without My Heart,2015

It ain't like I don't love her, already gave her that ring

Seems like I fail, I fail, every time
Can't get caught again 'cause I swore that I was gon' change

And if she finds out, she'll probably end up walking

Tyrone Davis,"Hey girl, now I know
You've been waiting for me much too long
But I got caught up in traffic
One turn I made was wrong

You see the DJ on the radio
Was playing our song
And I was reminiscing of the day
That passed and gone

Oh, I just, baby, I got carried away
Carried away, carried away

And before I knew it
I was ten miles out of the way
My mind was filled with thoughts
Sweet thoughts of yesterday

Of a time when you took my hand
And made me feel just like a man
Of a time when you took a hold
And thrilled my very soul

Oh, I just, baby, I got carried away
Carried away, carried away

294 said the highway sign
I should be home by now, home just in time
To lay her down to sleep
And pray the Lord her soul to keep
'Cause I love her, lover her, love her

By the time I got started
In the right direction
The DJ on the radio
Was playing another selection

But our song
Was still on my mind
Memories lingered on
Of how you have been so kind

Oh, I just, baby, I, I got carried away
Carried away, carried away

Thinking about the times
When you were so good to me

Oh, I just, baby, I got carried away
Carried away, carried away
Carried away, carried away

And before I knew it
I was ten miles out of the way
And I was wondering
Would you believe me when I say

Oh, I just, baby, I got carried away
Carried away, carried away
Carried away, carried away
Carried away, carried away
Carried away, carried away",I Got Carried Away,1977

I'll get along
You'll find another
And I'll be here

Tyrone Downie,"Éh!
C'est à dire qu'il y avait tellement de l'ambiance à cette époque là
Et comme j'étais un beau garçon
Quand je vois que je fête mes 30 ans aujourd'hui alors que j'avais 18 ans hier
Les jours passent comme les voitures
La vie de l'homme ne dure pas longtemps
Quel est Le Bilan de ma vie, hein, hey?

C'est fou ce que le temps passe vite
Ah si, c'est ce que je me dis aussi quand j'vois le chemin qu'on a parcouru jusqu'aujourd'hui
Je repense à notre enfance pas toujours aisée
Sans trop dramatiser
Ce n'était pas toujours rose c'est peut-être ce qui nous a motivé
L'esprit était déjà Neg'Marrons petits vagabonds à têtes grainées
On préférait sécher les cours et rester s'vanner au quartier
L'excès de curiosité était tel
Qu'on s'enjaillait en suivant les aînés qui étaient pour nous des modèles
À l'époque dans les halls les gangs breakent, smurfent, parfois se rebellent
Fresh Boys, B-Boys représentaient Garges-Sarcelles
Je me rappelle y'avait des bandes et des gangs
Y'avait même des gang-bangs
C'est vrai qu'on bandait à peine mais on voulait déjà ken
Partager nos kiffs, nos ambitions, objectifs, ddevenir quelqu'un
Un point commun celui de réussir par tous les moyens
Maintenant j'comprends Ben-J que quand on était gamin
On avait le même itinéraire mais pas le même destin

Le temps passe et passe et passe et beaucoup de choses ont changé
Qui aurait pu s'imaginer que le temps se serait si vite écoulé
On fait le Bilan calmement en s'remémorant chaque instant
Parler des histoires d'avant comme si on avait 50 ans

Ben-J tu te souviens ce qui nous a donné l'envie d'écrire
L'oreille scotchée sur Nova à l'écoute des MCs qui déchirent
De là nos premières rimes naissent
Les jeux de mots, puis les jeux de scène
Ne cessent de s'enchaîner des MJC aux sound systems
Et puis en un éclair nous voici sous les projecteurs
On s'adapte et on domine, professionnel ou amateur
Tu le sais
C'est la monnaie qui dirige le monde, c'est la monnaie qui dirige la terre
Nous propulse aux sommets des hits de là tout s'est passé si vite
C'est boule de neige, premier album, studio, promo, clip vidéo
Les Neg'Marrons s'exportent en live et prennent tous les publics d'assaut
Dans les quatres coins de la France on est partis fout' le dawa
Comme dans les avant-premières de Steel Pulse et des Fugees à Ris-Pa
On a tout déchiré le 22 mai à l'Olympia
Pour baptiser le concert mythique avec tout le Secteur Ä
La musique m'a mis official qu'est-ce que j'aurais fait sans elle
J'ai esquivé les plans couchals aujourd'hui j'kiffe grâce à elle

Le temps passe tellement vite t'as vu comment on a changé
Ky-Ja t'as pris du poids, Ben-J toi t'as encore poussé
Regarde ça se passe tu brilles des pieds à la tête
Blanches baskets, de l'or aux poignets jusqu'aux lunettes Cartier
Pas plus que toi négro respect au Congo
Toutes les rates me parlent de toi et de Bisso Na Bisso
Merci mais dis-leur que je ne suis plus le même
Que depuis, j'ai un fils et aussi une femme qui m'aime
C'est ça, faut construire une famille assurer sa descendance
Même si ce n'est pas encore mon heure t'inquiète chaque jour j'y pense

All that I own; you've been so good to me
If this world were mine
I'd give you the flowers, the birds and the bees
For with your love inside me, that would be all I need
If this world were mine
I'd give you anything

If this world were mine, I'd make you a king
With wealth untold, you could have anything
If this world were mine
I'd give you each day so sunny and blue
If you wanted the moonlight, I'd give you that too
If this world were mine
I'd give you anything

Oh baby, you're my consolation
And there's no hesitation
When you want me, honey, just call me

And honey, you're my inspiration
I feel so much sensation
When I'm in your arms, when you squeeze me

And the sky would be blue
As long as you're lovin' me

With you here in my arms

Than to have your ham 'n' eggs in Carolina

How does the rain fall for so long?
So long

Something tripped me, took my legs out
Thought I could fix it, repair it, climb over it
I'm so scared, I need you to hold me down
Hold me down, I'm losing ground

Seems like a battle
How can anyone ever win?
How can we start over again?

Sometimes I say I'd like you better
If you were only a little bit stronger
But I know I'm talking to me
When I'm talking to you
So what are we gonna do?

Something tripped us, took our legs out
Thought we could fix it, repair it, climb over it
I'm so scared, need you to hold me down
Hold me down, I'm losing ground, oh

Tyrone Wells,"Sometimes I get so tired
Just trying to find a place to lay my head
I look up to the sky
I feel the warmest light comfort me

I've seen the great heights
Reminding me I'm alive, I don't wanna die
I don't wanna waste another day or night

I know there's something more
Than what we're living for
I see it in the stars, I feel it on the shore
I know there's something
I know there's something more

I think we're all afraid
That we might be alone, alone down here
We all want to have some faith
At least that's true in my case to just believe

I've seen the great heights
Reminding me I'm alive, I don't wanna die
I don't wanna waste another day or night

I know there's something more
Than what we're living for
I see it in the stars, I feel it on the shore

This world may crumble into the ocean
It could all end tonight
I undermined you then tried to find you
My only source of light

I am breathing, I am breathing, I am alive
I don't wanna die
I don't wanna waste another day or night

You say people are made of
Glass and dust

See where the canyons are

Lost my balance on a high wire
Trying to figure out what to do

Kamikaze airplanes in the sky
Are we going down or will we fly?
This could be a shipwreck on the shore
Or we could sail away forevermore

A melody I chase after

I wrote my name down on your arm
You set off avalanches in my heart

We are the people that rule the world
A force running in every boy and girl
All rejoicing in the world
Take me now' we can try

We lived an adventure
Love in the summer
Followed the sun till night
Reminiscing other times of life
For each every other
The feeling was stronger
The shock hit eleven' Got lost in your eyes

I can't do well when I think you're gonna leave me
But I know I try
Are you gonna leave me now
Can't you be believing now

But I know I try
Are you gonna leave me now
Can't you be believing now

Can you remember and humanize
It was still where we'd energized
Lie in the sand and visualize
Like it's 75 again

We are the people that rule the world
A force running in every boy and girl
All rejoicing in the world
Take me now' we can try

Well it ain't no plex with the East and the West 
With plenty drink for your kids and plenty of weed for your chest
So leave your pistol at home cause we ain't trying to go to war
The common denominator in the sitution 
is barre like a star you can shine with 
Roll on 20's and smoke pine with me
c'mon and try to leave your mind with me
Steady be sellin, celebratin, for payin our dues
With so much drank in my cup the soda water don't even move
I's a playa can't associate with the plexin
Bone hard, bitch, Mo City, Texas
And a veteran don't get me wrong cause put you a glass
Pour you a glass instead of beating on your ass
Take a chill pill bill
Blow some kill pop the steal
Since we won't ba seen 
Sippin syrup till we leave 
From the dirty-third coast it ain't no roach a G
So fill your cup up to the brim and have a toast with me

In other words just sing the song

In the city of syrup we like to jam music slow
Still come up substance make them hit the floor
84's and vouls with the freshes on my lows 
Specialy on the fours doors
Bump the strape againts rows 
Flosh low concert looking like a lumber yard 
Waving my trunk up and down the boulevard
Charge the platinum card and the visa to the max!!!
Still won't get no sleep till my click see some cacs
Cadillacs and six packs we guys bangin screw
Click click clack, get yor wimp ass threw 
Payin do's and stayin tru is the rule of the game
On top of the food chains
Bangin screw it won't change for nothin

Tyte Eyez,"[Big Moe]
Huh, Wassup Boo
Maan, you stay talkin bout you're down wit me
But you stay on that complaining thang, you know what I'm sayin?
I ain't down wit all that complaining and fussin and fightin man
I'm a playa type dude, I'd like to let my gal get in the way,
But, you know what I'm sayin, the Lord blessed me with somethin
So I gotta take advantage of that, you know what I'm talkin bout
So I gotta do it, so its whateva

[Chorus]
I wonder if I didn't come home
Would you still be down with me, yeah
Because I'll leave you tonight, uh ohh
I wonder if I didn't come
Would you still be down with me, yeah
Because I'll leave you tonight, uh ohh

[Verse One]
If I didn't come home
What would you do to me?
Get on the telephone? Call Tyrone? Tell him come get you in he morning
You're wrong, this is my song
And I gotta pay bills, keep my happy home
Wreckshoppin all night long
I'm ready, fire burnin
No matter what you do to me, my wheels gon keep on turnin
Are you down? So please don't get me started
I got bitches out of town, if you fuckin wit clowns, I'll leave you broken
hearted

[Chorus]

[Verse Two]
I let you play one time, then I knew you were mine
The way you caress me baby and sex me, I 'd have to say you put it down
You took me, and you put me under you're wings, I can't lie
Can't no other take your place, and can't a damn thang comply
I don't know if you noticed, but you're the throwedest on my list
Can't no nigga or no bitch compare their loving to a love like this
Up and down, thick and thin, I was always there
Ready to box or unload on a bitch, you know I don't care
When you kiss me with your lips, I just fall in a daze
Me and you against the world baby, priorities are gettin paid
Diamonds blindin, hoes cryin, ain't a damn thang changed
Showin up and pourin up, in this damn rap game
And by the way, I'm gon let you run the streets with your thugs
When Valentine's comes around, you know who's gettin your hugs
Fuck faces by fireplaces, Drink chases on mink rugs
You a dog, you gon rome, but always find your way home, so what

[Chorus]

[Verse Three]
Now if I don't come home, would you blow up my phone?
Punch holes in my styrofoam? Misplace my chrome?
Childish games in yo dome got yo mind confused
A made nigga or a fake? Now its time to choose
Many have tried my shoes, but didn't travel too far
You knew the shit that you was in before you fucked the star
Look how you suck up all my barre, you think this shit's for free?
All this hustling in these streets keep all this ice on you and me
Picture how nicer it can be, private flights twice a week
Without you gripin about some freaks and how they saw me at the beach
I'll practice what I preach, you sit being obsolete
And remain to keep my business and my hustle out of reach
And now if I don't come home, would you still be down?
You are a fool, I will admit, but start practicin now
'cause I'm still the same playa that's all about my dough
And I'm not comin home tonight, you triflin ass hoe!

I'm still a player, a confidential player
I'm just trying to do something right, so let me live my life
Even though I'm still hustling, I know you want to see me struggling
But at least I'm trying to do something right so let me live my life

[Tyte Eyez]
Lord knows I had my share of doing the wrong things
But a bonified player that finds the life in me
Casualties make us cry but still we got to mash
Keep my eyes up on the sparrow and mind, up on my cash

Penetrate, finish last maintain a steady pace
Keep the busters out your business and haters up out your face
In this last rat race, the lord some's got to come
Shrivel my signature I call it rapping refunds

The ones that criticize be the ones you call your friends
The ones that ride it out ain't gone always be your kin
But then, you got to know, if it's yours you gone get it
But also you got to know that everyday, ain't terrific

Precision about your plans, keep it real with your fans
Watching my baby boy grow to be a young man
My daughter got to know, from the jump you a queen
And f*** what them n****s say you tell them your daddy is a king

[Chorus]

[Big Moe]
Everytime I look around
These haters they be talking down
Big Moe that done bring more light
I even had a, had a harder time

But I'm still here still going strong
You can't believe what you hear in the song
About the year two triple o three
Whole wide world sipping drank with me

I got money but I'm still a little stressed
I thank the lord cause you know I'm the best
A little love set with the press
Why you want less cause through this

I guess it's best for me, to stay calm
And hold it down till the day that I'm gone
I got a white cup in my palm
Feel what a peach crush Mo-Yo's just a
Player, player, player, player

[Z-Ro]
Money, the rule to all evil that's what I need
Between the hours of 3 to 7, that's when I bleed
Motherf***ers gone making the block hot, so I stay and move around
Tyte Eyez and Z-Ro stacking paper, it's going down

Break the shop of a n**** that's short stopping my change
But me and him to the fullest ducking bullets at close range
Feeling crazy, like I'm a lose my life to a b**** n****
But while I'm here I be a rich n****

Nephews and nieces, niece cool clothes and chains and pieces
I break bread with my family when my record releases
Besides skills in the west, n**** got mouths to feed
Anything against the grain just light a finger spot over seas

Saturday morning as a youngster I ain't have no bike
And I ain't have no Nikes, but in the triple I'ma have more ice
Around my neck and my wrist with fern doors
Z-Ro, confidentially yours a player

See what's going down on a Friday night
I was on a drink so a nigga feeling fine
She was over there giving up the freaky eye
Stepped to her, with the drink in my hand
Do you have a man, or do you have a girlfriend
You never know, you might be creeping
So what you think little mama you and I
I know you heard this once too many times
So what you sipping on, little Chardonnay
Can I but you another drink if it's okay

She was the finest broad in the club that night
(She was like music)

Baby you must be from Tennessee
Cause you the only ten, that I see
A straight up, dime piece from your head to your feet
A nigga can't help or put you in the diamonds on me
We at the bar buying drinks I'm really digging your style
Small waist, bow legged straight white pearly smile
It'll only be a while 'fore I'm getting your digits
Best believe every time you see me, a dime with me see man

Hey there shorty, can I get with you
Because we came here to party, and do what playas do

Baby I been peeping you, for a real hot second
I know you got a man, and I trying to disrespect him
But check it, I get the message when you tell me that you need him
But baby, I ain't trying to change your lifestyle either
Your people steady telling you, to leave dude alone
But it's hard, you just pictured a new car and a home
A new phone to talk on, when you ride down the street
Your hair stay fixed, manicures smelling sweet
To me, all that beauty poo I know that you sick
It's the small things that count, and that's what you miss
I came back to get a kiss, and to tell you good night
And to really show you, that's it's goin' be alright
Kinda like Prada hot, to set the mood straight
Baby I'm your cow, goin' taking you away
Ok, go on ahead and lay your head on my chest
I know that's what you want, that mean you through with all the stress
I confess

Peep game, I ain't the one to jump fly
But since I stepped through the do', you been giving me the eye
I'm trying to figure out why, a girl so thoed
Want to mess with a nigga, that'll dig in her soul
I'm in control, let's keep it on the low
Watching your g-string, move across the dance flo'
While Moe over fo', screwed up moving slow
Only pulling bad hoes, that's down for losing clothes
I suppose, one I get up in your mind
Two, lay down then get up in your spine
Three, that's me a bonefied G
I smash and then free, that's the taste of a ski I-P
Are-O miss, to lace your bubble bath, in Don P and Cris
Watch us made that switch, but I'm far from a trick
I just like to make your wish, to live like this cause I'ma player

Instead of making it better
You made things harder for me (harder)

You're not the only one who wants to be my one and only
Oh, I remember when you used to call me when you were horny
Now things done changed
I'm so far away
Probably be forever macking
Cause these bitches get so dramatic
Try not to get too attached cause I don't need no distractions, no
I would rather be alone then to be stuck on just one, oh

Tywanna Jo Baskette,"Layin' about, lyin' in bed
Maybe it was something that I thought I'd said
With the tempo of today and the temptation of tomorrow
I don't know if I could give you anything but sorrow

They stay alive this late on Radio Five
But the pen that I write with won't tell the truth
'Cause the moments that I can't recall
Are moments that you treasure
Better take another measure for pleasure

Losing you is just a memory
Memories don't mean that much to me
Losing you is just a memory
Memories don't mean that much to me

Now you're here, I'm here too
Could be this easy for me and you

Losing you is just a memory
Memories don't mean that much to me
Losing you is just a memory
Memories don't mean that much to me

Lyin' about, layin' in bed
Maybe it was something that I thought I'd said

Que solo la tristeza quiere hablar conmigo
Ahora que la lluvia se ha llevado

Ahora que he olvidado lo que soy, 
recuerdo en el pasado lo que he sido

Si he sido lo que fui fue por tu cuerpo
Si he sido noche fue tu noche quien lo quiso
Si he sido beso es que mis labios aprendieron a ser beso 
para ti

Si he sido lo que soy fue en tu regazo
Si he sido vida fue por darte a ti la vida

El tiempo no fue tiempo entre nosotros
Estando juntos nos sentimos infinitos
Y el universo era pequeño comparado
Con lo que eramos tú y yo

Si fuiste lo que fuiste fue en mi casa 
que para ti fue tu palacio y tu guarida
Amiga, amiga
Qué dulce esa palabra
Y qué sencilla esa palabra suena hoy

No hay noche más oscura que esta noche y el frío
Se va depositando en los rincones del alma
Y ahora que el silencio va borrando 
la suave vibración de tus palabras
Ahora que no soy apenas nada
Recuerdo lo que fui cuando no estabas

Backstabbers, low blowers
Illegal cocaine growers
Starvation, profanity
Anxiety, brothers trying me
Gun slingers, dead ringers

Yo, my slang's out of this world
Mix collaboration man, little man and his girl
Way of life got me thinking, plus I'm analyzing young
Youths on roofs, you know, three time felony brutes
Roll together, tropical trees puff, whatever
Yo we could go run up on, kids for leathers
What drug? Faculties bubble keys for G's
Cream flow like seven seas, hit chicks Guyanese
Word up, hold your head before you fall out
The morgue route, the devil want that
Let's get my niggas locked all out
Change for better, that be my only vendetta
With life, feed your seed right, he's breathing indeed right
Chef, remarkable, sparkable, raps and tackable gats
Never get jacked, see ya then move black
Paradise trife, plush with much ice
Getting nice, laying back, sleep all my life
Word up!

Crack patients, dime smokers
Vial carriers, mocha tokers
Burnt buildings, brothers building
Save the children, investigative reports!

Calling all cars, calling all cars! Ghetto
Psychos, armed and dangerous, leaving mad scars on those
Who are found bound, gagged and shot when they blast the spot
Victims took off like astronauts
Get with this, even your best can't
Come on down, you're the next contestant!
Get your pockets dug from all your Chemical Bank ends
Caught him at the red light on Putnam Avenue and Franklin
They used to heat up the cipher with a shot that was hyper
Than your average JFK sniper
He just came home from Spofford
Rolling like Kaufman, and laid that ass out like carpet
Stop the stuttering boy, save complaints for the five-oh
Then praise the God - chk-a-chk POW!
They release shots and premeditate to grab
And then they jet back to the lab
And then remain in Shaolin, an endangered island
Where shorties lose blood by the gallons

Crack patients, dime smokers
Vial carriers, mocha tokers
Burnt buildings, brothers building
Save the children, investigative reports!

Yo, I grab the pen for revenge and let loose, see
Like Muslims, standing on the block, rocking a kufi
The hundred-dollar kick rocking kid's back for more
Starting gold wars, with black Reeboks and Velours
Jungle way of life, living villain
Packed with visions, copywritten
Throwing bread to pigeons, Christ has risen
King Elegant, slang master, jack expensive noodle hats
In sixty-nine, old timers time that brothers shot craps
The baggy blue Guess jeans, pull strings off in Palm Springs
I'm locked in the bing, Rocky ring labelled rap king
The corner emperor - the golden thieves play the benches
Rednecks be hanging big niggas down in Memphis
Back in Now-Y, hit the bull's eye with loaded nines
Life is like Tarzan, swinging from a thin vine
Shatter dreams, then mirrors don't need a press spirals
Aim at the white shadows with big barrels
Of Moet-ers, the bald headers, milk and Armarettas
Who fear none, crushing all personal vendettas, yo
They use guns while we angrily shot arrows
You better keep your eye on the sparrow

That fills more body bags than apartments in projects
And as far as the coroners know

Put on by my family brought to the academy
Of the Wu and learned how to
Fuck up yo' anatomy, steadily, calm and deadly
Spatter-head lyrics I lick through your transmit
MC's submit to the will as I kill your

Lebanon Don, Malcolm X beat threat

One man ran, trying to get away from it

Into your chamber like Freddy enter dream
Discombumberate your technique and your scheme
Four course applause, like a black dat to dat
You're stuck on stupid like I'm stuck on the map
Nowhere to go except next show bro
Entertaining motherfuckers can't stop O
In battling, you don't want me to start tattling
All up on the stage cause y'all snakes keep rattling
Bitch, you ain't got nothing on the rich
Every other day my whole dress code switch
So just in case you want to clock me like Sherry
All y'all crab bitches ain't got to worry
Can't get a nigga like Don dime a dozen
Even if I'm smoked out I can't be scoped out
I'm too ill, I represent Park Hill
See my face on the twenty dollar bill
Cash it in, and get ten dollars back

Pass it in your thing, put valve up to twelve
Put all the other LP's back on the shelf
And smoke a blunt, and dial 9-1-7
1-6-0-4-9-3-11
And you could get long dick Hip Hop affection
I damage any MC who step in my direction

Niggas still talking that shit is absurd
My repertoire, is U.S.S.R
P.L.O. style got thrown out the car
And ran over, by the Method Man jeep
Divine can't define my style is so deep
Like pussy, my low cut fade stay bushy
Like a porcupine, I part backs like a spine
Gut you like a blunt and reconstruct your design
I know you want to diss me, but I can read your mind
Cos you weak in the knees, like SWV
Trying to get a title like Wu Killa Bee
Kid change your habit, you know I'm friends with the Abbott

Burnt to a crisp, bombarded my pistol grip 
Tongue gripped the nigga, raw tone the jawbone

The battle everybody in the world just came to see
Golden Arms, (ah!) take out these cornwalled ass MC's
All y'all corns - walk out the door (ah!)
You run the same rhyme that the crowd don't want to hear no more
Gun blastin this and flashin that, reality now actually
You better listen, you better listen carefully
We came here (we came here), to dull the bass (ha, ha, ha)
And Mathematics catch the cut while RZA Ra just hold the bass
And I'm rhyme and on timin', it's so fresh from out the pack
Niggas got problems, 'cause the Wu is fighting back
Please don't sing (please don't sing), yo battle rap (ha, ha, ha)
We got the most, the sugar coated bully rhymes from out the back
And we breakin', and we taken everything you fuckin own

Fifty shell hot track leaking out the Lexus
Eyes hot, Cyclops, cyborg boulders

Daily operation, bullet train tingle farther
Eight seconds a scar your style wild buccaneer
Round table revolve around ten musketeer
Think you, got all the riches
Think you poli with bitches
You could run the fuck opponent, gotten with the glitches
The swiftness, hit the spots that are vital
Shake the ground decent, like 3 sticks of dyno

Start the next generation by artificial insemination
Contaminate stations, for music in the making
Concentration camps, Assassinate for industry domination

I'm a nuclear warhead bomb evasion
Extermination of the next man, when the German's blazing
We burn this for occasions, regardless I see your expiration

Blow a hole through your brain so you can think with a clear mind

Human civilization in concert treble concentration camps
Replacement amps blown, Speaker abduction
The Mad weed seduction corruption
From The brain cells decreasing
Its sucker duck season. fuck treason
Blast as you trespass, bullet enters your mouth and exits your ass
Impregnate the math, then give birth to a newborn
Figure of speech drew form, with 8 arms
Napalms, collapses stages you perform on dominate
Drama face, abominate, sling crack behind the black high gate
The nine fades the hearts of men
Slip the cartridge in
Off the hook like telemarketing sales condone over the phone
 
Danger zone

With a great cannon, bones cerebral swollen
Straight both ways scanning
All you roaches lay down I spray the brain damage
Bring the banners, the green gamma ray
Gain up the same data, Scatter
Then a dark part where D and you used to play all day
The ray sound stung you, You kung fu check the cleaner
From fire line I gun you for fun
Dial nine one one
Someone tore down the tunnel son
One two check your fronts

Countdown...
Are you ready? Are you mad inside?
Got you strapped down to your seats
Outta the doorway, bullets ripped, full clip
God speed, approach follow my lead
Firewinds gust, empire crush
Full thrust, fall in the hole, roll wit the rush
Untouchable chunk of earwax and soul
Soundwaves slay out the back, ?cave? smoke
My belly-full prance dance, avalanche quote
Down slope, elegant as Fantasia
Killer whale tale inhale, black male from Asia
All out the wood works, hood shirts and wizards
No match, unhatch, the rap is rigid
In the shaft, shotty cop, hip hop to the limit
Nightwatch, pad mark 
Sparks spin a quake nuclear blast, heavy on the cash
Gimmie what it takes NOW!!

Wit the possibility to stop your walkin ability
God forgive me, spark enemies wit pistol grips
The missile tip's impact hit you so hard, you shit through your dick
Official scripts strikes when physical hits
You physical bitch, watch for the imperial blitz, serious shit
Submit, subject to the wreck wartone, and thought poems
Liver than WWF Warzone
Walk upon ? tracks, bodies collapse
Rap for lottery stacks, shatter like when pottery cracks
Logical facts from the terror dome
Spill from the guts, trail to you ?puss? from where you bust

Of a hundred wild niggas piled in a Trojan Horse
Thought method, set it on generic mic ethic
Professional neck shit, left foes beheaded
This music, is mind control like computer chips
Been doin this for numerous years, refuse to lose it
Wit turbo tactics, maneuver like a trained soldier
Hall of Fame flame thrower, take game, it's game over

The boulevard ain't safe for your kids, that's how it is
In the ghetto, we ain't scared to death, but scared to live
So Goldy, mosey to the spot, get that moldy

He lost his lady, two months ago
Maybe he'll find her, maybe he won't
Oh wonder that love

Brothers try to pass me, but none could match me
No girl can freak me, I'm just too nasty
Lost on the dance floors, I attack y'all
Snuck through the back door, guess who they saw?
Goldie and Ghost, black African Rose
Star-studded low lenses, plus the mural was dope
Airbrush W-B's, STOP! (Shake your body, body)
And cop a couple of these (She's a hottie, hottie)

Scottfree and Chauncey, very upset
They're sick and tired of living in debt
Tired of roaches and tired of rats
I know they are over

One in the head, I'm fed, this is how we doin
Put a Ruff Rider on my dick, bust right through 'em
Come out your shirt, insert the party rhyme
Fine Dr. Buzzard, Bacardi Lime
We passin it, takes the shake your Calvin Klein
Before the floor gets moist, taste and follow mine

I was born with this magnet, warned by the dragnet
About my dirty habits, I got to have it, the super-glow
Deuce Bigelow - Male Gigolo
Gold hands crush Coke cans and Michelobs
Style is Nino, black Benzito, Valentino
Nine needles - voice; evil steelo
Hit, like the bull, more pull than Magneto
Crush kilos with my bare hand, reload the Eagle
Nine dirty strikes, leaped up off all you people
Burn therapy, chemo, seap hoes
See you through the peephole - in the crime lab
Countin Ginos, cut-tin dime slabs
Then he bagged up Chino, rushed through the crowd with a hee-ho
Slapshots, jackpots, and pe-nnals
Throw graffiti on the wall, throwin up Reemo
Gambino three dice, headcrack Cee-Lo
In ya earhole, let the snare roll go low
Lower than low, lower than zero
Who's your rhymin heroes? *heavy breathing*

With high-heel shoes and tattoos on side titties
Shorties swallow up the apple cider
Ra' doin a buck forty in the yellow Spyder
With the black interior, my mack superior
to your theory of gats, up in the cafeteria
I used to cut class and bang lunch tables
With four finger weaves and long chunky gold cables
Now I'm known to smack drum machines, carry +Guillotines+
Watch my bullets scream (""Pheeewwwwww!"") and hit the target
You can't trace the path of air for Richard Starlett

It's the return of the bad boy, the mic Sean Penn
Floss gems across the globe with my nine Sourceman
At a speed that excedes your convertible Benz
From a distance you glimpse, supernocular lens
Stay hotter than a ex-con dodgin the pens
Killa Squadron, known to start a popular trend
And the emblem, symbolize the wisdom
certifies the platinum, magnifies the stardom
Shots bust at random, wake you out your boredom
Kings of our kindom, reppin from our hoodlums
Gotta whip them problems, 'cause yo we step on toes
Bangin heads knockin teeth loose, welcome to the pros
Flash quiz, do that nigga handle his biz?
I spin a song like Michael and Diana in the Wiz
The rough shit, I bust it for the republic
Government, you ain't lovin it, whatchu fuckin wit?

Outside I don't expect no love
Man this grip, make the fans flip, don't chance it
Cop the goods, while my hundred hoods run rampid

We started as friends, you had a boyfriend
I took you from your man, that's the way we began
I didn't think it would come back to me in the end
That wasn't part of the plan, you had my heart in your hands
I guess broken wings, are hard on a man
You ran back to scrams, had me stuck in a jam
I didn't understand, where we went wrong
I tried to block you out, but you call on the phone
I want to, bad to the bone, all to myself, all alone
You sighed on the line, then I heard a dial tone

[Chorus]

Yo, I stayed up so late, just, thinking of you
I wish that I can take back, all the pain we been through
On the path by myself, my back's on the wall
Sometimes I want that I shouldn't have met you at all
I told you if you just, leave the man you was with
I'll take you back in my life, and we'll seek happiness
Then you finally did, I took your heart for a ride
I didn't tell how, I had a chick on the side
It's been a couple of months, in this triangle of love
I didn't realize, she was the one that I want

I thought we was tight as a blood

A young youth, yo rockin' the gold tooth, 'Lo goose
Only way, I begin to G off was drug loot
And let's start it like this son, rollin' with this one
And that one, pullin' out gats for fun
But it was just a dream for the teen, who was a fiend
Started smokin' woolas at sixteen
And running up in gates, and doing hits for high stakes
Making my way on fire escapes
No question I would speed, for cracks and weed
The combination made my eyes bleed
No question I would flow off, and try to get the dough all
Sticking up white boys in ball courts
My life got no better, same damn 'Lo sweater
Times is ruff and tuff like leather
Figured out I went the wrong route
So I got with a sick ass click and went all out
Catchin' keys from across seas
Rollin in MPV's, every week we made forty G's
Yo nigga respect mine, or here go the TEC-9
Ch-chick-POW! Move from the gate now

It's been twenty-two long hard years, I'm still strugglin'
Survival got me buggin', but I'm alive on arrival
I peep at the shape of the streets
And stay awake to the ways of the world 'cause shit is deep
A man with a dream with plans to make C.R.E.A.M.
Which failed I went to jail at the age of 15
A young buck sellin' drugs and such who never had much
Trying to get a clutch at what I could not
The court played me short, now I face incarceration
Pacin' going upstate's my destination
Handcuffed in back of a bus, forty of us
Life as a shorty shouldn't be so rough
But as the world turns I learned life is hell
Living in the world no different from a cell
Everyday I escape from Jakes givin' chase, sellin' base
Smokin' bones in the staircase
Though I don't know why I chose to smoke sess
I guess that's the time when I'm not depressed
But I'm still depressed, and I ask what's it worth?
Ready to give up so I seek the Old Earth
Who explained working hard may help you maintain
To learn to overcome the heartaches and pain
We got stickup kids, corrupt cops, and crack rocks
And stray shots, all on the block that stays hot
Leave it up to me while I be living proof
To kick the truth to the young black youth
But shorty's running wild smokin' sess drinkin' beer
And ain't trying to hear what I'm kickin' in his ear
Neglected, for now, but yo, it gots to be accepted
That what? That life is hectic

My minimum table stacks a verse on a gamble
Energy is felt once the cards are dealt
With the impact of roundhouse kicks from black belts
That attack, the mic-fones like cyclones or typhoon
I represent from midnight to high noon
I don't waste ink, nigga I think
I drop megaton bombs more faster than you blink
Cause rhyme thoughts travel at a tremendous speed
Clouds of smoke, of natural blends of weed
Only under one circumstance that's if I'm blunted
Turn that shit up, my clan in the front want it

When the MCs came to live out the name and to perform
Some had to snort cocaine to act insane before Pete rocked it on
Now on with the mental plane to spark the brain with the building to be born
Yo RZA flip the track with the what to cut

I'm on a mission that niggas say is impossible
But when I swing my swords they all choppable
I be the body dropper, the heartbeat stopper
Child educator, plus head amputator
Cause niggas styles are old like Mark 5 sneakers
Lyrics are weak like clock radio speakers
Don't even stop in my station and attack
While your plan failed, get derailed like Amtrak
What the fuck for? Down by law, I make law
I be justice, I sentence that ass two to four
Round the clock, that state pen time check it
With the pens I be sticking but you can't stick to crime
Came through with the Wu, slid off on the DL
I'm low-key like seashells, I rock these bells
Now come aboard, it's Medina bound
Enter the chamber, and it's a whole different sound
It's a wide entrance, small exit like a funnel
So deep it's picked up on radios in tunnels
Niggas are fascinated how the shit begin
Get vaccinated, my logo is branded in your skin

Monk on the hunt for machine gun funk
I gets you open like a slug from the shotgun pump
Double-barrel, yeah Meth bring it to them proper

What's your definition of a real emcee
From what you dedicated, hey it must be me

I go on to the break of dawn, and just don't stop
Give me the green light, and the sign one way

Those who test it, respect it, the method
You know I can't be messed with, I'm hectic, accept it
I'll break it down, I get down for my crown
Filthy, dirty like a worm underground
Tryin' to avoid the early bird, that's my word
Before I kick the bucket I'm a kick 'em to the curb
Check out the cloud, smoked out from the mouth
Other brothers got mad fly, flew south for the (winter)
Hey, enter the square if you dare
Without a flaw, I'm so raw that I'm rare
I'm goin' to the country, I'm goin' to the fair

Swinging through your town like your neighborhood Spiderman

While I get you flipping off the shit I'm kicking
The Lone Ranger, code red, danger!
Deep in the dark with the art to rip charts apart

Rae got it going on pal, call me the rap assassinator
Rhymes rugged and built like Schwarzenegger
And I'm gonna get mad deep like a threat, blow up your project
Then take all your assets

First things first man you're fucking with the worst
I'll be sticking pins in your head like a fucking nurse
I'll attack any nigga who's slack in his mack
Come fully packed with a fat rugged stack
Shame on you when you stepped through to
The Ol Dirty Bastard straight from the Brooklyn Zoo
And I'll be damned if I let any man
Come to my center, you enter the winter
Straight up and down that shit packed jam
You can't slam, don't let me get fool on him man

For crying out loud my style is wild so book me
Not long is how long that this rhyme took me
Ejecting, styles from my lethal weapon
My pen that rocks from here to Oregon
Here's Mordigan, catch it like a psycho flashback
I love gats, if rap was a gun, you wouldn't bust back
I come with shit that's all types of shapes and sounds
And where I lounge is my stomping grounds
I give a order to my peeps across the water
To go and snatch up props all around the border
And get far like a shooting star
'cause who I am is dim in the light of Pablo Escobar
Point blank as I kick the square biz
There it is you're fucking with pros and there it goes

You chill with the feedback black we don't need that
It's ten o'clock hoe, where the fuck's your seed at?
Feeling mad hostile, ran the apostle
Flowing like Christ when I speaks the gospel
Stroll with the holy roll then attack the globe with the buckus style
the ruckus, ten times ten men committing mad sin
Turn the other cheek and I'll break your fucking chin
Slaying boom-bangs like African drums (we'll be)
Coming around the mountain when I come
Crazy flamboyant for the rap enjoyment
My clan increase like black unemployment
Yeah, another one dare,
Tuh-took a genius (to) take us the fuck outta here

The Wu is too slamming for these Cold Killing labels
Some ain't had hits since I seen Aunt Mabel
Be doing artists in like Cain did Abel
Now they money's gettin stuck to the gum under the table
That's what you get when you misuse what I invent
Your empire falls and you lose every cent
For trying to blow up a scrub
Now that thought was just as bright as a 20-watt light bulb
Should've pumped it when I rocked it
Niggaz so stingy they got short arms and deep pockets
This goes on in some companies
With majors they're scared to death to pump these
First of all, who's your A&R
A mountain climber who plays an electric guitar
But he don't know the meaning of dope
When he's looking for a suit and tie rap
that's cleaner than a bar of soap
And I'm the dirtiest thing in sight

From metaphorical parables to fertilize the Earth
Wicked niggas come, try to burglarize the turf
Scattin' off soft-ass beats them niggas rap happily
Tragically, that style, deter-iate, rapidly
Uncompleted missions, throwin' your best known compositions
You couldn't add it up, if you mastered addition
Where I come from, gettin' visual is habitual
De-mon-strate walkin' on hot coal, in rituals
I splash the paint on the wall, it formed the mural
He took a look, saw the manifestation of it, was plural
Rhymin' while impaired, dart hit your garment
Pierced your internal, streamlined compartments
Just consider the unparallel advantage
Of a natural disaster that's impossible to manage

Attack when you least notice through explosive postage

I got the golden egg plus the goose

Yo check yo yo, check the script
Me and the gods get it ripped
Blunts in the dip, forty dogs in my lip
Had a box, 'Boom Boom' the bass will blast
We was laughing, at all the girls that passed
Conversation, brothers had begin to discuss
(Hey yo, Ra, remember that kid ya bust?)
Aw yeah, he ran, but he didn't get far
Cause I dropped him, heh heh heh heh heh ha!
Not knowin', exactly what lied ahead
My little brother, my mother sent him out for bread
Get the Wonder, it's a hot day in the summer
Didn't expect, to come across, a crazy gunner
""Hey Shorty, check it for the bag and the dough""
But he was brave, looked him in the eye, and said ""No!""
Money splattered him, BOW! then he snatched the bag
In his pockets, then he jetted up the Ave.
Girls screamin', the noise up and down the block
(Hey, Rakeem!) What? (Your little brother got shot!)
I ran frantically, then I dropped down to his feet
I saw the blood, all over, the hot concrete
I picked him up, then I held him by his head
His eyes shut, that's when I knew he was
Aw man! How do I say goodbye?
It's always the good ones who have to die
Memories in the corner of my mind
Flashbacks, I was laughin' all the time
I taught him, all about the bees and birds
But I wish I had a chance to sing these three words

After laughter, comes tears

Me and my man, my ace big Moe from the shelter
Bout to hit the skins, from this girl named Thelma
Now Thelma had a rep, that was higher than her neck
Every girl from Shaolin dissed her respect
We was stimmy, you know how it is when you're blitzed
Three o'clock in the morning, something gots to give
Moe said he'll go first, I said I'll take next
Here, take this raincoat, and practice safe sex
He seemed to ignore, I said be for real
She's not even worth it, to go raw deal
A man's gonna do what a man's gonna do
He got butt-naked and stuck the power you
Twenty minutes went by, my man went out, without a doubt
I'm not pumpin' up, I am, airin' you
Hey yo, he came out laughing with glory
I'm surprised, he's still livin', to tell his story
But he carried on, with the same old stuff
with Stephanie, like a whammy, he pressed his luck
Both tried to be down with O.P.P.
Ain't nothin' wrong but he got caught with the H.I.V. now
No life to live, doc says two more years

Let's do it like this
I'ma rub your ass in the moonshine
Let's take it back to seventy-nine

I bomb atomically, Socrates' philosophies
And hypotheses can't define how I be droppin' these
Mockeries, lyrically perform armed robbery
Flee with the lottery, possibly they spotted me
Battle-scarred shogun, explosion when my pen hits
Tremendous, ultra-violet shine blind forensics
I inspect view through the future see millennium
Killa Beez sold fifty gold sixty platinum
Shackling the masses with drastic rap tactics
Graphic displays melt the steel like blacksmiths
Black Wu jackets Queen Beez ease the guns in
Rumblin' patrolmen tear gas laced the function
Heads by the score take flight incite a war
Chicks hit the floor, die hard fans demand more
Behold the bold soldier, control the globe slowly
Proceeds to blow swingin' swords like Shinobi
Stomp grounds I pound footprints in solid rock
Wu got it locked, performin' live on your hottest block

As the world turns, I spread like germs
Bless the globe with the pestilence, the hard-headed never learn
It's my testament to those burned
Play my position in the game of life, standing firm
On foreign land, jump the gun out the frying pan, into the fire
Transform into the Ghostrider, or Six Pack
In A Streetcar Named Desire, who got my back?
In the line of fire holding back, what?
My peoples if you with me where the fuck you at?
Niggas is strapped, and they trying to twist my beer cap
It's court adjourned, for the bad seed from bad sperm
Herb got my wig fried like a bad perm, what the blood
Clot, we smoke pot, and blow spots
You want to think twice, I think not
The Iron Lung ain't got ta tell you where it's coming from
Guns of Navarone, tearing up your battle zone
Rip through your slums

I twist darts from the heart, tried and true
Loot my voice on the LP, my team is on to slang rocks
Certified chatterbox, vocabulary 'Donna talking
Tell your story walking
Take cover kid, what?  Run for your brother, kid
Run for your team, and your six camp rhyme groupies
So I can squeeze with the advantage, and get wasted
My deadly notes reigns supreme
Your fort is basic compared to mine
Domino effect, arts and crafts
Paragraphs contain cyanide
Take a free ride on my thought, I got the fashion
Catalogs for all y'all to all praise to the Gods

The saga continues
Wu-Tang, Wu-Tang

Olympic torch flaming, we burn so sweet
The thrill of victory, the agony, defeat
We crush slow, flaming deluxe slow
For, judgment day come'th, conquer, it's war
Allow us to escape, hell glow spinning bomb
Pocket full of shells out the sky, Golden Arms
Tune spit the shit immortal combat sound
The fake false step make, the blood stain the ground
A jungle junkie, vigilante tantrum
A death kiss, cap off squeeze another anthem
Hold it for ransom, tranquilized with anesthetics
My orchestra, graceful, music ballerinas
My music Sicily, rich California smell
An axe killer adventure, paint a picture well
I sing a song from Sing-Sing, sippin' on ginseng
Righteous wax chaperon, rotating ring king

Watch for the wooden soldiers, see-cypher punks couldn't hold us
A thousand men rushing in, not one nigga was sober
Perpendicular to the square, we stand bold like Flare
Escape from your Dragon's Lair, in particular
My beats travel like a vortex, through your spine
To the top of your cerebral cortex
Make you feel like you bust a nut from raw sex
Enter through your right ventricle clog up your bloodstream
Or terminal, like Grand Central Station
Program fat baselines, on Novation
Getting drunk like a fuck I'm duckin' five-year probation

War of the masses, the outcome, disastrous
Many of the victim family save they ashes
A million names on walls engraved in plaques
Those who went back, received penalties for their acts
Another heart is torn, as close ones gone
Those who stray, niggas get slayed on the song

The track renders helpless and suffers from multiple stab wounds
And leaks sounds that's heard
Ninety-three million miles away from came one
To represent the Nation, this is a gathering
Of the masses that come to pay respects to the Wu-Tang Clan
As we engage in battle, the crowd now screams in rage
The High Chief Jamel-Ah-Rief take the stage
Light is provided through sparks of energy
From the mind that travels in rhyme form
Giving sight to the blind
The dumb are mostly intrigued by the drum
Death only one can save shell from
This relentless attack of the track spares none

Yo! Yo! Yo, fuck that, look at all these crab niggas laid back
Lampin' like them gray and black Puma's on my man's rack
Codeine was forced in your drink
You had a Navy Green salamander fiend, bitches never heard you scream
You two-faces, scum of the slum, I got your whole body numb
Blowing like Shalamar in eighty-one
Sound convincing, thousand dollar court by convention
Hands like Sonny Liston, get fly permission hold the

Came in threes we like the Genovese

It's Earth, ninety-three million miles from the first
Rough turbulence, the wave burst, split the megahertz

Hey yo that's amazing, gun in your mouth talk, verbal foul off
Connect thoughts to make my man Shai walk
Swift notarizer, Wu-Tang, all up in the high-riser
New York gank adviser world tranquilizer
Just the dosage, delegate my Clan with explosives
While, my pen blow lines ferocious
Mediterranean, see ya, the number one traffic
Sit down the beat God, then delegate the God to see God

Broken down and crafted in seconds
Lady's choice, the golden voice still peppered
Better, respect it, bitch believe
I pull rabbits out the hat, tricks up my sleeves
I air out the showroom, the shit can breathe
Fix your weave, behold my expertise

[Chorus]
I got my Uzi back, you dudes is wack, face it the Wu is back
I got my Uzi back, you dudes is wack, face it the Wu is back

Take it back to the ? leanin' gettin rec room punch
We in them authentic alley switchin' joints
Major general niggas, five stars
Both arms rock when coke dropped we read a hundred niggas palms
Silencers, garbage bags of hash
For every cop we paid retired now the nigga on smash
Gash you out your burner fast
You swing down hatin' me now respect get your fingers off the glass

[Chorus]

Yo what the fuck yo?! Yo what the fuck y'all comin' for?
Get the fuck away from my door!
We got big guns in here, coke over there
With blue bag and E pills stashed under the chair
And there's Boss Hog black and white pit with the pink lips
Stan thought he was soft 'til he bit his fingers
The shit had me dyin' yo, big fat nigga bleedin'
Big cat nigga all season
On the beach truck, stuck with Hawaiian ice
Diamond twice the whole city thought I bought Fubu
Blew you, authentic doodoo, picture the fog iced out
Eighteen karat rap between noodles

[Chorus]

Up at Killa Bee headquarters, full rips is poured up
I saw ? sippin' Henny from a iced out cup
Yo with the blunt, two-way vibratin' off the hip
I sit took, three drags off the honey-dip
Now what you talkin'? You see my gold fronts sparkin?
Ain't tryin to hear what you dogs be barkin
Read the headline, that was blast on today's Post
Dead King, thought he could ace Ghost
Queen, couldn't even jack Monk
Probably find him in Doc Doom's back trunk
Bdoodoodoo! I'm up at the Wu library
Readin Malcolm's, ""Any Means Necessary""

John John, Bacardi straight up hold the ice
So nice like New York they had to name him twice
Name your price, I black out then change the lights
Give you the same advice that I gave my wife
Don't fuck with mine, Clan give you lumps in nine
Let the smoke cloud clear so the sun can shine
Culture shock, for some of us that's all we got
Whether you ball or not, you can all be shot

New York, New York, legendary rhyme boss
Code name Charley Horse, bust with blind force
I smash set it and wreck for cash credit or check
You crabs test, can't measure the threat
I dance on a nigga like my name's Zab Judah
Rap barracuda, three XL kahuna
Sure to get it perkin' and cause a disturbance
I'm thirstin', feel what I feel then we can merge then
Creep it through the states in V8's and 12's
My weight's hell, fuck with me then brace yourself
The Noble, Sir I mass mogul
Known to blast vocals, and move global on you locals

This is grown man talkin', coward I split your head
I'm from the East where the streets run red from the bloodshed
Hit Chef for the rice and peas
Nuff respect Father E tumbled at ease
My brothers can't wait to squeeze the automatic
They need wreck like a drug dealer need a addict
Floatin' on the 95, sting like a killer bee
Your hands can't hit what your eyes can't see

From dark matter to the big crunch
The vocals came in a bunch without one punch
Rare glimpse from the, strictly advanced, proved unstoppable
Reputation enhanced, since the cause was probable
So you compare contrast but don't blast
Through extreme depths, with the pen I hold fast
Watch the block thirst for one became all
Shot 'em with the long forgotten rainfall
Delivered in a vivid fashion with simplicity
The blind couldn't verify the authenticity
The rhyme came from the pressure of heat
Then it was laid out, on the ground to pave streets

[Chorus]",Uzi,2008
