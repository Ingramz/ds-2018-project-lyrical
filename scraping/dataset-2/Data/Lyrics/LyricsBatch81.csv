Cormega,"Yea (House of Hits) 
Finally up in this nigga 
On the real all you crab niggas know the deal 
On the real all you crab niggas know the deal 
To my seed May I lead you into no breed of evil 
In the categories and stories I breed my sequel 
You know the money blues blunts broken 22's 
Monkey see Monkey do 
A shorty sipping sunny dew 
Now its V.S.O.P. in a G.S. that's mad smokey 
Murder tree's, Crusin gun in the stash so it won't poke me 
Up in the Marriot, Sweet dirty tint, Don't make no noise cause we dirty 
Tell the ho's to hurry in 
We got the room lit up with perfume, and mad boom 
And there's video taping of booming ass's on the zooming lens 
Rolling on you non descript niggas 
Your marked for death like colombians with bad coke that gip niggas 
Tilt the dutch, twisting up the uwee if your skilled enough 
In Will we trust, salute the dead the nine mili's bust 

[Chorus] 
On the Real all you crab niggas know the deal 
On the Real all you crab niggas know the deal 2x 

Now its verbal abuse cause the mic's in use 
This is your sorry excuse 
Get your neck put in a noose 
K-L is quick to let loose, to make your blood count reduce 
Over the snare drum 
We reproduce like cum 
Impregnating the track, making it fatter than it was 
Giving life to idea 
Through the verse is what he does 

See a close call about two clicks from my fortress 
We rolling squad deep, on the Kawasaki hourses 
QueensBridge got the drop on you niggas trying to toss us 
We metal down now its time to show these clowns who the boss is 
We live for the shit, Ain't trying to take no lossess 
Accumalating to much cream for you to touch 
Fucking welcome to my clutches, wipe the blood on off my chuckers 
From the ruckus 
Your gone and your crew still love us 
Can't call it, I'm in love with this good life shit 
I'm working with jewels, car, chicken clits, paying rent 
Murdered Presidents, running wild, stacking in piles 
Onyx pendants, and Rubied down shit from the nile 
Kamikaze style, sought the antique three pound 
Yo Nas, lets cop this brick and let the mobb supply the town 

[Chorus: x2] 

(Play some treats on us) 
Drugs in my shirtsleeve 
The side bubble converti 
Eyes low cause the lye blow 
Five-oh know we dirty drive slow 
Write a line sipping a glass of wine 
The block is mine cause I am a live criminal mastermind 
When I rhyme, I perfect this, niceness, I'm blessed with 
Exhale precise shine like cocian white 
Its the life of Pablo, Escobar niggas I know 
With diamond rolexes, that drive infinite's and lexus 
So send my enimies a message 
My Tommy Hilfiger vest, is bullet proof, so when niggas shoot 
I'm still protected 
So never ask why I write so violent 
My brain storm formed on a dorm in Rikers Island 
I remained calm while you tried to bite my style and 
When I performed niggas mic's went silent 
To the kid who made my man ill will bless this 
(On the real) 
When I catch up to your ass you know the deal 

On the real 

[Chorus: x4]",On the Real,1999

[Prodigy]
Yo dunn, we got guns in the grass, it's three at night
I'm about to take the last swallow of the Eases Jesus
Who got fifty on the next tree, we gotta stop at the store
We need D batteries for the theme music

Snatch the biscuits from out the lawn
Fuck a cab, lets take cracked-out Yolanda's Saab
We gave that bitch two wibbles
And skated off with her vehicle for that pillow

All outside the borough, dunn what happened to Queens
Like Supton(?) and 1-2-1, Farmers and 116th
The got us on the be	-Q-E, just to get a taste of that greenery
We took our smoke out to Coney Island, posted up by the Himalaya

Pina Colada champales mixed with Dani'
That's St. Ide's in dunn lingo
Spillin' it on the floor for our dead people
While I spark the sequel shit; my niggaz got lungs

When we smoke, that shit only go around once
Dogs, we just killin' time
Somebody just got they shit twisted on the block fuckin' up the grind
So, 'til it pipe down

We just going at these sluts - bitch, we want to fuck right now

[Cormega]
Son I'm on a bench high eatin' chicken wings and french fries
A crackhead fuck spent his last bucks on six dimes
I'm one gram from big time, a spliff away from overdosin'
My heart is broken, my man started smokin' again

P, I heard the tunnel open again
I spoke to Flex he said he's gonna let both of us in
It's time to load up the autos and semis
I wish my niggas bank was in a physical form unlike

I got my uptown nikes thugged out and icy
Mad deep, jumpin' out the Cocaine white Jeep
Through was strugglin', so I resume hustlin'
Rap game or crack game my crew is still bubblin'

Yo, three in the morning and the D's on the corna still
Seems we were born to kill, yo P meet me on the hill
So we can jet through Queens in SUV's

Straight Outta Queensbridge a crazy motherfucker named Cormega
In a Viper chromed out beyond measure
I got your girl and, wit' a Sterlin'
automatic that'll have your ass twerlin'
Niggas know if they ever fuck wit' me
The police gonna have to come get me
off your ass, I don't really give a fuck
Bitch motherfucker, I should really hit you up
Niggas want to mumble, when I come through
Iceberg jeans and ice comin' out the sleeves
Showin' off on a motherfucker like that
Cause I'ma hustler slash rapper
Life's a bitch, my gun smoke'll make ya catch cancer
Nigga I rep' the street till I rest in piece
If you want to bring your vest and heat
My projects'll be the last place you ever see
So when you in my neighborood, you better duck
Cormega is crazy as fuck
When it's on, your ass better mean it
Cause when I come back boy, I'm comin' Straight Outta Queensbridge",Straight Outta Q.B.,2000

[MC Shan]
You love to hear the story, again and again
About a rap dynasty that just won't end
The monument, still in your face
Niggas played out, Shan still in the place
Hip hop was set out in the dark
The Bridge was never Over, we left our mark
The jam is dedicated to you and your boys
I brought my Queensbridge thugs to kill that noise

[Havoc]
If you was an out-of-towner, had to know somebody wit strength
You know the drill, shit was real, fuck around, got killed
You know the Hill breed of thugs, death to those that squeal
Squeezin them slugs, one love to thugs that died in the field
So many names don't got time to spit em, but through my rhymes they livin
We the Bridge through tracks I'm givin
Never lose sight, 41st Side's my life
The 40th Side of life, dunn we keepin it tight

[Cormega]
Yo it ain't just the music
Group aspirations or ghetto illustions
It's the product, east side, and all the beautiful children
And unleashed dreams comin through each building
If you sleep, you better wake up as you see
Mega more mature, I'm on a record wit Nature
Mind on my paper, nine in my waist
There's no denyin the greatness
Queensbridge, never try to disgrace it

[Millennium Thug]
Aiyyo the Queensbridge associations breeds similarity
Bricked up, chipped off rocked out salaries
Pull out long guns, pop out casualities
It's like I gotta see a thug nigga ill as me
The Ill Will in me, I rep that willingly
Step back enemies, death tracks feelin me
Six blocks, losin my mind
Runnin from D's
These P's got me usin my nine, I pop off

[Nature]
Y'all know the place where stars is from
Every night it sparks off and the crowds'll run
We leave chicks strippin over strollers (Slippin Sova)
In Queens, you be the victim till you get to know us
Your hood's bogus, my hood be keepin it crunk
So much be jumpin off I ain't sleep in a month
Why'all can play the front line, I be deep in the cut
Drive through, you can't peep it enough
You in the Bridge nigga

[Capone]
You must pay homage to my projects
We thorough to the end
Only jail and death divide us
From rap to the crack suppliers
Out-of-towners get knocked off
We regualte blocks laws
I had the hood like Watts flooded wit cop force
QB to the cracks in the pavement
Mister Everything that ? pool for stacks in a basement
Niggas understand the drama we bring
The legacy, dynasty upholding the ring where QB is king, what!

[Tragedy]
Yo for you I take a fifth to the head till I url
Boomerang dunn, QB bust they gun
Keep them PC niggas on the run, one
Mahti specialist, 2-5 the nemesis
The last verse, ""T.O.N.Y."" remember this
Resurrect through the birth of my seed, crime genetic
You synthetic, your gangsta's cosmetic
I move niggas telekinetic, who want to set it

[Prodigy]
Yo yo move...
Me and my dogs comin through
We the grain, go against us you feel pain
Get ranked on, we beat niggas numb
These niggas is dumb, you can't resist my dunns
2001 we still thump, the fuck happened to ya'll?
We like that snowball, goin downhill
We get large, you get bullets lodged
In your jaw, your ribs, your arms
We party hard, at the bar
Buyin bottles of overpriced styles and Remy Mar
The Head Niggas In Charge

Yo blow faces, fo-fo blazes, no one's safe
This music mogul rollin wit a hundred soldiers
Gangstas we postal
Oh you didn't, want to know whose life Was Written
The life I'm livin
The ice the women
The kites that sendin to lifeless biddin
The streets to prison
I touch you then buck you
Heats be spittin
La-ser, are fifteen doors come down
Jaws is broke, your whole crew is coffin bound
Your hoe, your man, lieutenant, your boss get found
This dough I got, I spend it and toss around
New York it's time we flip it, where you from?
Ladies, it's time we flip it, where you from?
Now tell me who was the true thugs in videos first?
Who had the projects behind us, who bit it the worst?
We from the largest project, yo the biggest on earth
Queensbridge know they history, left y'all cursed 'cause

[J] {*laughs*}
[C] Yo, listen, check this out

[Cormega]
Yo, last night I had a dream it had me open like a fiend
And all I remember is me, you, the moon and ocean breeze
My heartbeat increased like I seen approachin D's
I relapsed cause of these words you spoke to me

You said you want to feel me - inside you - conceal me
I belong to you no other woman could steal me
We mentally attached, essential in fact
What you give is so real you know I had to give it back

How I feel don't even matter if I ain't expressin (affection)
My mind was affected you healed me (we destined)
Your beauty so addictive, I can't deny your presence
So pure I gotta add cut to spread you on

You're all I need in this world to succeed
I won't let you go cause I can see you trust me
I'll never leave or deceive you, and if it's understood
Then we can be together cause you treat a nigga good

[Chorus: Jonell]
All I need is you - in my life, to be down with me..
All I need is you - to hold me, and to make me see..
All I need is you - to be there, in my time of need..
All I need is you - I'll be there, when you need me to be..

[Cormega]
When I was runnin the street I know you wanted to leave
Especially the time, you found a nine in my jeans
But you persevered, gave work and tears
That's why I'll never desert you or hurt you yeah

I used to keep feelings concealed, now I reveal 'em
I was hustlin to get right, now we chillin
Oh my man starin at ceiling thinkin of children
And any other situation we might deal with

At first, I was hesitatin, makin a commitment
Now I see you different - so many ways
I need a queen like a king did in great Egyptian days
And it seems you've been afraid I might get into things

That might put me away for years, save your fears
Listen ma, let's get one thing clear
I'll never leave you, deceive you, and if it's understood
We can be together cause you treat a nigga good

[Chorus]

[Cormega]
Yo, I'm not the type to have a next chick call on your phone
Come see you at night and in the morning you alone
I keep it real with you, like my connect you got it good
I need to deal with you, have yet to leave the hood

But I'm still with you everytime you need me I'm there for you
If I didn't care for you why would I be here for you?
You 'pear loyal, got the kid spoiled
On the low I don't think I was prepared for you

You cook good, look good, Boo I adore you
And if you get me mad we won't fight I'll ignore you (yeah right)
Just playin, but yo I'm just sayin
I'm about to go, cause Hi-Tek waitin
Yo son that beat ready?

And guns is rusty
I'm stingy with trust, you only get once to fuck me
The pure white endorser, skills real like a Porsche
For the cash I'm there like a stalker, uhh

You say the same shit
I play the game with skills like Latrell, and write so well
And I gotta go to heaven cause my life is hell
If I quit rap, this cook white gon' sell

You niggaz got fat while I did time in jail
Now it's time to pay, the rhymes you say
Sound a lot like mine, but not quite as ill
As my rhymin skill, I could relate to how Tyson feel

My life is real, you're the fragment
Of somebody else life, or shit you imagined
It's like the beat make me react savage...",All I Need Is You,2001
Cormega,"1: Yo Yo Yo Yo Yo Mega Man
Cormega:Whats Up Son
1:Whats the deal Son Yo remember what we was talking about the other day yo?
Cormega: Yeah
1: Well Son I just want you to spit that jewel you was spitting the other day. Let these dudes hear this real quick.
Cormega: A Jealous Nigga is a dangerous nigga 'cause he's dealing with emotion you know what I'm saying and emotions conflicts with intelligence and common sense. You see a loyal nigga is more vallable to Brute force because Brute force can be turned against him
1: A Loyal What?
Cormega: A Loyal Nigga
1: Yeah Yeah
Cormega: Yo Loyalty's worth more than wealth in a world where niggas be all for self I got friends who never called until they want help and expect me to show love I don't receive for them it hurts me because I would bleed for them but is it worth me risking being free for them? I got a lot more to lose and thoughts a lot more secluded yours a lot more polluted what should I do man? Bitches clocking my dick just like the Blue Van my nigga blue clad I see he was one of my true mans the same nigga's life I saved. Defy my name betrayal put a price in a grave Nigga's I'm wiritng this way to up they want to stop you now they talk about you now even your friends wanna rob you.
You think I'm lying ask the Rich Porter Mob Dudes
Shit is Real give me a mental face of a friend who won't snake you and loyalty unlike my previous label and all my niggas on the run be careful the cops don't know your secrets but your mans do
Loyalty never give it til it's earned nigga, that's the reason why I wasn't with the firm nigga all I got was big spank and sherm nigga something that a lot of snakes don't deserve Loyalty never give it til it's earned all I ogt was Big spank and sherm Nigga



",Loyalty,2001
Cormega,"Yeah, yo, yo, yo, yeah man, knowhatI'msayin, son?
Times be like that, my nigga died
You wake up the next day, and that shit really hits you like
""Damn, I ain't gon' see my nigga no more.""
Shit's fuckin me up times, son
Word, yo, yo, yo

Yo, we bled for hours, now I learned to ?dwell? tomorrow
I had to see my nigga Yammy dead, but he can rest with honor
'cause he was reppin on his quest for dollars
I was the one who took him Uptown, with someone into measure powder
Now I treasure our memories together, it's hard to believe
I'ma never see you again, but I'ma make you breathin through pen
So everyone can see you my friend, in fly sneakers again
Life is sweet and kinda deep when it ends
I still remember you, beefin over bullshit, at basketball games cheatin
Yo, my cipher ain't complete, yo I'm sorry for that argument we had
On 12th Street over a cell, now I'm well into seakin ??? well
What we made up the same night
And through the years remained tight, the same love
The same gold rockin the same nights
Now that you gone, I'm here to reppin your name right

Chorus: (2x)
Did you ever lose a nigga you love?
Then ask yourself is there a heaven for thugs?
God forgive me for fillin niggas with slugs
And is it a crime when we was dealin these drugs?

And to my cousin Ben
my muthafuckin man, I find it hard to understand
That you gone, you physical form is dormant
I'm lost like the Bulls without Jordan
Tell my man J.B. from ??? I said peace
Son, I live a thug life, I clutch mics
With the same intensity that I used to clutch right
G-Fresh was at your funeral, son I felt it
And if I start cryin when I rhyme I can't help it
Analyse, never think I forgot you, son you my heart
And even death can't keep the two of us apart
From day one, watchin cartoons and shootin playguns
Who ever thought we see this day come
Tell my moms I miss her, give her a kiss and tell her
That her younger child done her proud
I know she heard about me runnin wild
Ya'll gone now, but livin in my memory
You fallen soldiers, sleepin in serenity

Chorus

Killa Black, whattup my nigga?
I know you chillin with my nigga Ill Will 
inside a ghetto heaven building
With a Mac-11, dealin your jeans, screamin Infamous Queens
Forty-First Side kid, you know me
I know the O-Z's are whiter there, pussy much tighter there
Navigator ?rents been a shine and live brighter yeah?
The same old thing, gun, game and cocaine
Your brother Havoc got a platinum gold chain (shinin, kid)
Son, it's all good in the hood, I'm in a Lex with the wood-grain
??? is never misunderstood, dearly departed
Hear me acknowledge real niggas who passed
Wheather holdin heater, in it for cash
Some of ya'll ???, some are pure like
Columbian raw, knockin on heaven's door
The only thing my niggas ran from alive is law
I reminisce your memories, for you this Hennessy I pour

In heaven with a pretty angel braidin' ya hair
Eatin' ya sunflower seeds drinkin' ya beer
All I could do is wish you was here, in the physical

Super hit me on the two way and left me a message sayin'
You mighta got killed, it couldn't be real
Then reality struck me, nah, that shit crushed me
Your life ended, you cheated me outta a friendship

Plus we wasn't speakin' as frequent
I was O.T., you was in Queens bridge
Son you know me, it wasn't no secret
I wasn't agreein' with niggas motives, shit is corrosive

Like rust, who can I trust when niggas is cobras
Yo I spoke at ya funeral, your aunt sang beautiful
Ya moms so proud the way the crew came through for you
Word son, the love is real

Blue, I think of you and the tears begin
I know you my dog, that's a man best friend
My life ain't the same since you met ya end
So for you I represent my nigga

When I come to Greens borough I think of you
Sittin' on twenties, sippin' on Remy
If you looked in dudes eyes then you woulda saw envy
And maybe you'd still be alive, you hear me son?

I mean ya daughter was barely one
Too young to understand she'll never see you again
Little Ariel at daddy burial
Unaware of how much daddy cared for you

And I don't gotta talk about the things I'll do
Son I gotchu, be easy
Ya little girl will never need and never see the treachery
This world has to offer, yes believe my nigga, uh

Mommy, I need you to guide me
And help me find a judist among me, I know truly you love me
I battled no power but the ruler above me
And prayed for my enemies as well as my friends

Will I ever see you again? Ma, you was so pretty
I'd give anything to have you near me
Life is precious like a diamond necklace
I need you, to point me in the right direction

I'm still learnin' life's lessons, ya my inner essence
I'm your reflection as you seen in my conception
Through-out my adolescence I was missin' you, wishin' you
Would appear in the physical, but you never came

Rappers feel they my equal, but can't measure my pain
That run through me like blood in my veins, my life could be a movie
Who I'm I? A real thug yours truly
Mega, mega, for all my fallen

Did you ever lose a nigga you love?
Then ask yourself is there a heaven for thugs?
Or will you be forgiven when your spirit is judged

Cormega,"[Mega] Yea Spank, what up my nigga
[Spank] Sup, baby what's happenin'
[Mega] Yo son man, look at this shit man
times be fuckin' changin' man
Know what I'm sayin man
I wish we just go back sometimes
You know what I mean
[Spank] No doubt son, you know we all wish
that man, but we goin' through transition right now baby
[Mega] Son as long as I got my niggas with me
But let me reminisce yo

[Cormega]
I'm about to take your minds on a trip
'cause everytime I rhyme I kick 'The Realness'
Remember niggas used to take gold frames and snatch chains
Infact that changed, 'cause the error of the crack game was real
Mad nights, I used to daydream
Wishin' I could be the next Alpo? or Green? for Fourth Ring?
I used to be magnetized to fly rides
Had a scheme to get my cream and eventually rise
I became a little nigga gettin' money type often
Livin' the ill life, sportin' Nike Delta forces
I saw Scarface and got my first taste for power
I never knew grams of powder could make bags of dollars
I spent hours writin' graffiti
And niggas like Smitty made gettin' rich look real easy
Remember when...

Damn son you takin' a nigga back right now

[Chorus]
Yo, to all my ghetto legends, whether live or in the essence
Facing fed time or in a pearl white Lexus
Sometimes you gotta sit back and just analize
Cause nothin' moves faster than the hands of time

[Cormega]
And I remember when the whole drug game was hot
Son a cop got shot, in Southside Queens
And tactical narcotics teams making headlines
Being big time could get you fed time
Undercover vibe, pouring out just like red wine
Mega keys, gettin' see's 'bout D's
I heard stories 'bout bulletproof 300 E's
Yo the mind of a analist is mine so handle it
The way I right rhymes, considered a gift
I used to wish that I could be fly like Black Trent
Rockin' Fi-las, rhyme was the thing I couldn't de-ny
I used to read about supplies gettin' busted
'cause guys that they trusted, made deals with D.A.'s, minds corrupted
The feds estimated Fat Cat was gettin' millions
Black Ratti was the richest nigga in my building
Remember when...

Yea son was doing his thing

[Chorus]

[Cormega]
Before my story ends, rest in peace to Killa Ben
And live niggas memories you live again
Sometimes I close my eyes and just reminisce
And wonder how alotta cats got so rich
I can't forget RK, he introduced lots of loose rocks
A few cops, and alotta sales from rooftops, yea
You shoulda seen the deez when Will bought the red 3-Roller
Memories of those days are golden
Yea, for all my ghetto legends
Ever burrough, all my niggas who was thorough
Yea, knah mean

[Cormega talking]
Know what I'm sayin' son
Niggas was holdin' it down back then
Fat Cat, Tony Montana, Big Wall, Queen
Niggas for the team
Motherfuckin my man Supreme Magnetic and Four Green?
All them Brooklyn niggas
Alpo? and all them mobstyle niggas doin' it uptown
Boy George all them Bronx niggas
Niggas was seein' money back then son

y'all niggas know what I'm talkin' 'bout, word",Glory Days,2001
Cormega,"[Verse 1]
I'ma pimp, a pen's my hoe
She don't ever move until I say so
Her only purpose in life is get me large
I got my pen workin' 16 bars
When I'm happy she happy, sad she sad
She make sure we both have
She know I got plenty more to replace her
Bitch better have mine
I'm not lettin' no pen get out of line
You did it, I mean, can you dig it
She committed to me, she please niggas for me
My shit's so tight she leave a nigga for me
I met her in a studio, she caught my eye
With her over kickin' whack ass rhymes
I needed a pen, so she let me borrow her
Like my shit ain't ill enough to overpower her
I see he wasn't treatin' her right
So I gave her some paper
And let her do her thing that night
that's right, I took it from that player
He to concerned with his money and his pager
She told me, shit he be kickin' is so weak
I told him, your hoe chose me I'm goldie
Be cool, or we can make the heat come out
Your pen work for me 'till the ink run out (player)

[Chorus]
Money talks and bullshit walks
Rap is a hustle y'all
Only the strong survive, I was born to rhyme
Put me on the street I'm goin' for mines
Money talks and bullshit walks
Rap is a hustle y'all
Only the strong survive, I was born to rhyme
Put me on the street nigga

[Verse 2]
My rap is uncut raw, out the door
Type shit to have fiends lookin' for more
Your rap is lactose; you cooled off, the glass broke
Customers complainin' never comin' back yo
My rap flow is pure all white, in the hood all night
You made your first sale when I sold out
My shit numbs your whole mouth, yours leaves a foul taste
My rhymes a felony yours never seen a trial date
You need a legal aid, my pen got the DA's paid
My flows sleepin' in a cave
No day's I got the streets in this mad
You need a mask to repair the ? here
You see the glass once I flip this track
You should see my stash, I got rhymes for days
Fuck a right front page, I stay deliverin, ain't no middle men
I never short my man or cross my fans
Or switch my supply when money cross my hand
It's funny, I'm here, I'm like the crew I used to roll wit'
You might as well work for me, I got the clientele
y'all put to much cred in that stuff you tred to sell
that's the reason your empire fell like Goliath
I'm supplyin' the ghetto to satisfy you
Marks, NARC's, is analiyzin' why this kid
Crossed the bridge and came through with platinum shinin'
Bringin' heat to the street like I had the iron

[Chorus]
Money talks and bullshit walks
Rap is a hustle y'all
Only the strong survive, I was born to rhyme
Put me on the street I'm goin' for mines

Yous a notebook crook with loose leaf beef
A backseat criminal who pass the heat
To somebody that blast the heat
Man it sound bad on the pad what happened in the street
A villain on the vinyl an analog outlaw
A lot of gats on your DAT taped southpaw
You thuggin when the mics plugged in
Barkin through the speakers like you got no sense
You're wild on the 2 inch
Got your platinum plaques to prove it
Your music's been around the world movin
And it come right back around to the ground on it
Now its time to face your opponent
Infamous cling to this real shit
Stuck where we started at
Fuck that
Not because I have to we want to
I love this shit
The raw is what I live for
To hear the sound of the crowd roar for more
To see the niggas that can't pay rush the door
Wildin on the dance floor when they song come on
Swinging they fists
Ready for war but its a different type of effect
Its not violence
They're just tranced by the advance
Tranqued by the sound bank
Put under the drum
Numbed off of our shit
Now who you rocking with them or us
Deep love or cheap lust
QB or bust
Infamous til we pass on
You're laughing at the wrong kid I take action
The fam are confidants, nigga
I write bombs that'll shatter your ambitions of being top dog
As we move through the stage floor I need to bass more
So I can taste it and make y'all go AWOL and lose it 
Say no more
Brace your delf nigga its on

Cormega 
Who tale you tellin
Are you frail or felon
Were you makin sounds or watchin niggas sellin
You exploit niggas lives in your rhymes and then avoid em
You never felt the moisture in the air from coke boiling
You never felt the razor scrapin your plate your hands achin
Yet you keep choppin cause there's paper to make
You never felt the power of invincibility
Clutchin a gun like fuck it dun
Its him or me
At your best you wasn't hand to hand 
No more than 3 grams
What the fuck you know about a ki man
You never hustle
Lets get it right my nigga wild woulda stuck you
Stop dry snitchin in your rhymes listen
What you tryin to do help the guys in blue
Indict duns so that could be another rhyme for you
You a parasite you never had a life
So you throw other niggas lives in your pad at night
Its clever when you write it
Spoken well for a dude who never been indicted
You know the deal motherfucker
The real make the fake niggas kneel
And lose appetites when you taste nigga's steel
My rhymes are what it take to get a deal
That make it real
I'm like BIG you can't replace the skill
I laced your ill like cocaine in scarface's grill
Your motherfuckin flow is basic kill
I'm Cor Mega raw forever
Y'all niggas know my steez I'm reppin for Queens
Your minor league I'm big time like Mark McGwire's deed
Your whole team is pussy
When I squeeze vaginas bleed
My lyrics they official
I bag up coke on dishes made of crystal
Your niggas they will miss you
My nickel plated pistol got 16 shots
You can take em with you
To the coffin or DAs office
Surgery nurses screamin we lost him
Life suddenly divorced and fuck it it cost him
You want beef say no more
Brace your delf nigga its on 
We spray 4 4 s bitch

",Thun & Kicko,2001
Cormega,"It's time to separate the rookies from vets
Pussies from threats, truth from lies
Supplies from dealers and death
I'm feelin' this, I'm young and ruthless
Status unmatched, undisputed, some assuming
My destiny to rep these streets

I'm built for this, the will is too strong
Feeling's numb from dealing too long
It's real count ya friends when you on
My pen is visual, I'm real, men are miserable
I feel the tension growing, you hold a grudge
A 45 with infra holding no love
Hungry like my ribs are showin', as if you didn't notice
I spit the potent, uncut, raw, my mind is pure ferocious
Like a shark, I tear you open, cut you blood in my ocean
My pen it ghost people, like dope needles

When I rhyme there's no equal
The flow will freeze you, like medusa stair, I'm so lethal
Obviously, I'm a vill, with odds against me
Like Rasheed Wallace, it's hard to stick me
I'm built for this, in the street, I'm powerful if shit gets dirty
30-30 clips will shower, you exist 'cause I allow you to live
I conquered you, I kinda knew you was weak, I can see how cowards do
I write epic facing a scholar, question my life expectance
My essence is gettin' money, my aura like Lexus

On the mic I'm relentlence, pursue the perfection
Ya new connect for pure, uncut raw, what
I caught a rush when ever my palms clutch a gun, pen or a ki
Or a dime satisfy my every need
I write rhymes with killer instinct, yet to find a nigga iller then me
Some smile at my face, yet they still against me

I doubt the fake, never sleep or deny death for waste
Or conversate in the presence of snakes
When and where and time I'm measuring weight
You destined to think or where does he get this paper
Son, we nearly extinct
I realized that when buried Spank, the real will perish ya life
Conceal evidence my rhyme skill is excellent

M for the man, E executioner
G get money, A all my niggas movin' up
I'm built for this, for real it's in me
Like RK, I make you feel the big heat
The illest is me, the drug dealer empties semi-auto
I conceal on these streets that to uphold the kiss of death
Tryin' to deal ki's and snort blow, you can't replace me

I live the rhyme I visualize, you ain't real I see it in ya eyes
I spit nines, weigh coke on scales that's digitalized
The realness I live and die, the streets I epitomize, the trife life
I rock jewels with ice, verbally I bruise mics
Mega live it I'm ghetto, my shit is chromed out
Give me a pen and watch a nigga zone out
I can't believe the shit I spit is from my own mouth
",Built for This,2002
Cormega,"It was 85 Queensbridge was crazy live
Smitty was an icon his son had an MB5
Shan was the man on the rap tip, Marley on the beats
Big Wag on the crack tip, shit was sweet

Trent was a fly nigga, John Boi a live nigga
Treach hung with Ugi, you my heart till I die nigga
Herb was a trouble maker RK a money maker
Can't forget Wee-Wop he was the illest ball player

86 is when The Bridge stuck together
The era of crack vails and dapadamn leathers
Karena was a funny nigga, Fat Boy a hungry nigga
Wells from the 40 busters was a get money nigga

When Tyrone died we cried with Thomas
Smash had the accident that shocked The Projects
Then The Bridge dropped, KRS got on the bandwagon
And did Shan but it was good for hip hop

And 87 hot day mix tapes was bangin'
Anita Baker sang while we were slangin'
Doing our thing hangin' on corners
With Roach that was enormous

Big Butter was rappin', Dime had the tournaments
Rodney was a flashy nigga, Prince Wally had heat
Mark Allen used to physically smash niggas
Can't forget Yammy with the skill and hand speed

That also it the year we first seen Blue Van Deeds
Fun and World was gettin' it big time
And nigga World was the first nigga I seen wit a five
88 was ill, John Hov got killed

In the summer time niggas parked their rides on the hill
Droughs was a fighter, Spunk was a cash getter
Up was mad skinny but not afraid to blast niggas
Don't even ask about a Queensbridge Jam kid

The music was loud and secluded the blastin'
I'm from 40-15 like Horse and Douler
Alley Joe Mar and Troy the future
Jungle to Watson fishin' the Austins

Puertorican one on the fifth floor snortin'
Can't forget cool Chip Hays and Bo Spud
Black Jay, E Flam, Mayo, Wallace Snake
Hi-see Starby, Gram Wiz, Crazy Barry and his brother Robby

A year later we was duckin' from Bobby
On the Ave it was Crazy Smalls Black and Party
Kenyon, Lisa, Inga, Richie, Opps and Howie
Suiter and Bar Kim the Foul One the hand and hand king

[Verse One]
Your son's stressin' you out
When he was home, he showed no respect for ya house
Now he locked up, callin' collect and you about
To put a block on your phone, Til he says you're the only one helpin' him out
He said his friends ain't there for him
He wished he'd listened when you said they don't care for him
Every night, before you sleep you say a pray for him
You even blame yourself cause you couldn't pay bail for him
You raised him the best you could
He respect you more now cause you're his best friend in the hood
He said he love you and he sorry for the trouble he cause you
And it isn't because of you he in there
So Live Ya Life...

Chorus: (Singing)
This Life, Oh this life
I promise to keep on, keep on, keep on, keep on strugglin'
I'm gonn do it right
So there won't have to be no troubles in my life

[Verse Two]
You single and strugglin', sleepin' with dudes
Get no feelings involved, they trickin' on you
You think you gettin ova, as time flies you gettin olda
You waking up with nobody to hold ya
You're like bad dope, nobody want you
Haunted by your past ghosts, they used to run through
Changin' is your last hope, but do you want to?
Are you still sensual prey when dealers come through?
Is your respect worth losin' for the next man's wealth?
Look in the mirror, stare at yourself
Everything you do in darkness will come to the light
Stop fighting your conscience and Live Ya Life...

[Chorus]

[Verse Three]
You had an addiction
It was so clear
Child welfare came into your home and apprehended your children
Now you faced with a decision
What ya love more : simulation or your children?
The Choice is yours,  In the presence of evil
you started sniffin', Boy you was scared of them needles
Your man died from sharin' with people
You know that dope good if you said ""it's diesel""
Now you staring at your kids room, but it don't seem true
It's sunny outside but it don't seem blue
You got kids who need you
What you gonna do?
The only way you gonna make things right -
Is to get yourself together and Live Ya Life...

[Chorus] - repeat 2X

Keep on, keep on, keep on, keep on strugglin' [4X]",Live Ya Life,2002
Cormega," 

I'm sick of gossiping bitches and niggaz who gossip like bitches
claiming they live but if you pop em they snitching
some wise from the building, the game knowledge of dealers
knowing they lack the heart of those who out on the benches
I was out in the trenches
which enables me to paint such a powerful picture
like Apocalypse Now
I put my heart in my lyrics, every time I sit down
I write, my source of inspiration ain't 3 and a half mics
I must have been an mc in my past life
presently I'm unquestionably poetic, I'm that nice
people act like, I don't deserve nothing I got
I grew up in the spot
my sleep was interrupted by customers knocks
some of y'all should just stop the animosity you got for me
luck it was not
for years we ran the projects like a marathon
these catastrophic, my time depth of pride became my own conquest
subsequently some are with me others ain't yet, the gun is within me
I wish for nothing except that my mother was with me
some place judgment against me based on nothing but envy
they pray for my downfall like the song by biggie
born in the city which never sleeps till rest in peace
its carved in stone some starved while others bled to eat
rap is my legacy I leave my seed my destiny
except I hope she never see the treachery success will bring
the trife life and death of kings
I'm from the rarest breed of people who rep the street and spit poetically
never sleep, rest assured mega is dope in its pure form
the dealer mc, keeping it real is my protocol
fall back I got you hoping off the style- I was working on it
the beat is lifeless, till I put my verses on it
I reminiscence confinement as I read a kite from
my people with secret inditements
freedom and trying, contemplating putting streets on the tires
dominating this beef with my rhyming as if you need a reminder
I spit that drug dealer shit you might have seen on the wire
what other lyricist is known for giving people consignment?
I'm eager to find my equal at rhyming
I rock, iceberg jeans with the nikes
an extremist when rhyming deep as poseidon
we lived in violence now I live in a peaceful environment
a secret asylum from the streets where people be wiling
some blind with fury from seeing my shining
like a phoenix arising from the depths showing the reaper defiance",Beautiful Mind,2004

hand to hand on the grind since a half a gram
Understand even then you couldn't pass me hand
was on the land all geared up and Dapper Dan
Around the year of them classic jams
I done seen niggaz get bitch slapped and ran
Word to yam a few got rich and swam
while I was sunk with they G packs trying to pump
It's over, no closure cars gave niggaz exposure
I was carried by Allah on his shoulders
Sober my first AR in the hood
Would of stuck a muhfucker and bring his truck if I could
Understood I was strong headed
But them streets and them guns gave me the wrong fetish
Cool whatever, I'm here we can do whatever
from the cars to clothes to the jewels whatever

branded in my head like the mark of the beast

If I die few'll cry, less'll do a bid with me
Once intrigued with money and fast cars
stubbornly I sold crack to my mans moms
Suddenly it troubles me so I asked God
forgiveness for pasts wrongs and future sins
Presently the coop I'm in
View as heavenly as the roof of ?Sens?
Like Vince Carter I'm too intense
for dudes defense to stop me I abuse the rim
Anybody can ball I do it to win
Son it's +Doe or Die+, all that other shit aside

Daydream of getting mines
Fuck scales and just as I ?tri-beamed to digitize?

From Brooklyn to Queens to O-T
with keys I sold in a V
So cold when I hit the street many people froze

Up to bat with precision
Sealing bags in the kitchen
Slinging crack to these pigeons
For the fact that I'm driven
My linebackers is missing
Send you back and good rides
Trapped in this mission where snakes and rats is forbidden
Keep my gun hidden niggas is bitches signing petitions
And they providing convictions
See I survive through the system under the livest conditions
My riders ride on a mission for snitching
You get your back blown right out of commission
You'll be missing like them crazy Christians and swimming with all the fishes
Your misses will come and visit your body with hugs and kisses
Now tell me is that nutritious we party with chips and liquors
Your wisses is coming with us for real kid they bought me presents
The difference is this is business big biscuits big figures
We click on religious niggas for acting too superstitious
Move cause the group is viscous
Shoot if you want your wishes to blow
See trife in the Bentley with a group of bitches

My design is already made
So young an so strong
And just waiting to be saved
My life's no longer in the hands of district attorneys or envious niggas
Who thirsty cause I'm OT with prince with thirty moving like magic
But niggas ain't worthy like Michael cooper when I shoot I aim sturdy
Mother maiden mother fuck em
Rhymes so dope I hope I make it through customs
We can take it to the streets like a game at the rucker
They claim they love us but all that changes
When you on and they fucked up dog ain't no flaws in a hustla
I ain't no longer in state greens and chuckers
Waiting for the beach port and the breaks streets oughta relate
I see it all in your face the window to your soul ain't tinted
You want to see me falling from grace
No way nigga I'm stretching my weight like cocaine dealers
What they gonna say now the flow way iller
If dough change things I'm no longer the same
But what I became does not conflict with from where I cam
I was dealing with caine like cold chilla back when lyricist rained
And dope was killing em, any MC who think they ill as me
Or real as me should chill I mean that's your opinion
But my raps is relentless like a mac with an infra

All I need is you - I'll be there, when you need me to be..

[Cormega]
When I was runnin the street I know you wanted to leave
Especially the time, you found a nine in my jeans
But you persevered, gave work and tears
That's why I'll never desert you or hurt you yeah

I used to keep feelings concealed, now I reveal 'em
I was hustlin to get right, now we chillin
Oh my man starin at ceiling thinkin of children
And any other situation we might deal with

At first, I was hesitatin, makin a commitment
Now I see you different - so many ways
I need a queen like a king did in great Egyptian days
And it seems you've been afraid I might get into things

That might put me away for years, save your fears
Listen ma, let's get one thing clear
I'll never leave you, deceive you, and if it's understood
We can be together cause you treat a nigga good

[Chorus]

[Cormega]
Yo, I'm not the type to have a next chick call on your phone
Come see you at night and in the morning you alone
I keep it real with you, like my connect you got it good
I need to deal with you, have yet to leave the hood

But I'm still with you everytime you need me I'm there for you
If I didn't care for you why would I be here for you?
You 'pear loyal, got the kid spoiled
On the low I don't think I was prepared for you

You cook good, look good, Boo I adore you
And if you get me mad we won't fight I'll ignore you (yeah right)
Just playin, but yo I'm just sayin
I'm about to go, cause Hi-Tek waitin
Yo son that beat ready?

And guns is rusty
I'm stingy with trust, you only get once to fuck me
The pure white endorser, skills real like a Porsche
For the cash I'm there like a stalker, uhh

You say the same shit
I play the game with skills like Latrell, and write so well
And I gotta go to heaven cause my life is hell
If I quit rap, this cook white gon' sell

You niggaz got fat while I did time in jail
Now it's time to pay, the rhymes you say
Sound a lot like mine, but not quite as ill
As my rhymin skill, I could relate to how Tyson feel

My life is real, you're the fragment
Of somebody else life, or shit you imagined
It's like the beat make me react savage...",All I Need Is You [*],2004

next time you see her hit her off with some loot and shit

string with the grin his razor blade blew six
ayo

[Chorus]
one love, one life, one mind dreaming
son one day I'm leaving
one thug showing you love for one reason
for all my niggaz that's locked down and bleeding (2x)

[Verse 2]
Anyway I heard Black Jay was getting paper
tell my nigga Nut his man Bass is here from Jamaica
I was holding down a fourth and for a other ton
you couldn't touch a jack unless you had gats or box cutters
I seen an ox cutter, so many features
niggaz sneaking up and blowing motherfuckers for their sneakers
I seen this kid cut police up, for real money creeped up
slid the ills out and blew the beast up
yo handcuffs can  make a man tough and suffer
my rhymes keep your mind stimulated like a lye puffer
yo this life is type bugged
I'm surrounded by dope fiends and thugs
but I'm a still maintain my brain frames so...

one love, one life, one mind dreaming
son one day I'm leaving
one thug showing you love for one reason
for all my niggaz that's locked down and bleeding (2x)

[Verse 3]
Yo the other day I got it on in my dorm
I had Fila slippers on then I transformed
my man dawg from ?Nostra? in the back posting
money started looking when he seen dawg approaching
I said, yo black we could take it to the back
but that's about the time the razorblade made contact
I got relaxed, the fact he collapsed and bitched up
and got ripped up and stitched up for trying to ?get ya'll?
I picked up my ill-son said chill
yo parlay and walked away the kids face build
stashed my ox in case they throw my ass in a box
I could splat the first idi-ot looking for props
the phone time locked, my chrome ox makes domes hot
if I can't live then I'ma blow up your whole spot
seen shorty on her visit and gave her a hug
when she cried I recognized we symbolized one love..",One Love,2005

Stop right there
That's exactly where I lost it
See that line
I never should have crossed it
Stop right there
I never should have said that
It's the very moment that I
Wish that I could take back

I'm sorry for the person I became
I'm sorry that it took so long for me to change
I'm ready to make sure I never become that way again
'Cause who I am hates who I've been
Who I am hates who I've been

Who I am hates who I've been
And who I am will take the second chance you gave me
Who I am hates who I've been
'Cause who I've been only ever made me

I'm sorry for the person I became
I'm sorry that it took so long for me to change

C'est que j'ai su reconnaître les mille et une choses qui te rendent complète,

On perd trop de temps à suer et s'écorcher les mains
A quoi ça sert si on n'est pas sûr de voir demain

Alors on vit chaque jour comme le dernier (barambambam)
Et vous feriez pareil si seulement vous saviez (barambambam)
Combien de fois la fin du monde nous a frôlés (oh)
Alors on vit chaque jour comme le dernier

On se dit ""Pire que notre histoire n'existe pas""
Et quand l'hiver perdure
On se dit simplement que la chaleur nous reviendra
Et c'est facile comme ça

On voit combien tout est éphémère
Alors même en amour
J'aimerai chaque reine comme si c'était la dernière

Quand on ne vit que sur des prières

Bien avant que s'éteigne la lumière

De n'avoir la tête qu'à mes poches et pas assez aux autres

On n'a pas de Georges Weya, ni de Kavanagh

Et beaucoup moins pour frimer dans ma prochaine Porsh

Aussi fort que je le peux, ceux qui ""hate"" ont tort
En plus honnêtement je le cache pas
J'aime bien le luxe, 'why a rien de mal à ça

Que je leur tendrai des chèques pour leur payer le loyer

Ma petite flamme secrète pour toi

Dont souvent je me sers afin de survivre

Corneille,"La terre saigne depuis la nuit des temps 
De grande misère et de guère souvent 
Et pour chaque soldats qui rentre 
Une femmes attendent 
Les hommes les pires et les tous puissants 
Les pires bourreau et même Adolf vivant 
Avait tous au moins une femme qui les aimaient tant 

Et quand c'est pas une sœur, c'est une mère qui est 
Et quand c'est pas la mère, c'est l'épouse qui est 
Et quand c'est pas l'épouse, c'est une autre femme 
Ou… une maîtresse qui espère 
Alors 
Si c'est vrai qu'elle nous pardonne tout 
Si c'est vrai qu'elles nous aiment malgré tout 
Si c'est vrai qu'elle donne aux hommes le jour 
Moi je dis, que le bon dieu est une femme 

Nos mères paient depuis la nuit des temps 
Depuis l'histoire de la pomme d'Adam 
Elles portent les mots et les torts du monde pour leur vivant 
Le ciel bannis la femme qui hais mon corps 
En infidèle jusqu'à la mort 
Faut être dieu pour être trahi et aimer …plus fort 

Et quand c'est pas une sœur , c'est une mère qui est 
Et quand c'est pas la mère , c'est l'épouse qui est 
Et quand c'est pas l'épouse, c'est une autre femme 
Ou… une maîtresse qui espère 
Alors.. 
Si c'est vrai qu'elle nous pardonne tout 
Si c'est vrai qu'elle nous aiment malgré tout 
Si c'est vrai qu'elle donne au hommes le jour 
Moi je dit , que le bon dieu est une femme 

Si l'or du monde etait dans la main du femme 
On lui ferait la cour pour l'avoir 
Imagine les hommes, si il n'avait qu'a chantait l'amour pour avoir 

Si c'est vrai qu'elle nous pardonne tout 
Si c'est vrai qu'elles nous aiment malgré tout 
Si c'est vrai qu'elle donne aux hommes le jour

Corneille,"Reposez en paix
Vos amis du nord m'ont soigné
Tout va bien j'ai manqué de rien
Vraiment je vais bien

Tu peux dormir en paix maman
J'ai trouvé ta belle-fille, maman
Je serai avec elle comme père avec toi, maman
À part ça,
J'ai dîné à l'élysée, maman
J'ai même chanté avec Charles, maman
Et... 
Tout seul les pied sur Terre, Je tiens ça de toi, maman

Père tout comme toi je rêve de refaire le monde,
Père tout comme toi je rêve un peu de trop,
Mais ta femme me réveille dès qu'il faut

Reposez en paix,

Tout va bien dès qu'ils chantent mes refrains,
Oui vraiment je vais bien,

Corneille,"Sur la tombe de mes gens
Je reverrai le jardin
Où j'ai laissé reposer les corps des miens un beau matin
Je retrouverai aussi ces braves
Qui nous cachaient de la fin
Je leur chanterai qu'on s'en rappelle toujours au nom de tous les miens

Sur la tombe de mes gens
Je reverrai le chemin
Le long couloir du désespoir,
Le grand exode, le long chemin
Et au bout toujours l'animal qui a changé mon destin
Qui, fatigué, m'a dit va, je laisse le plaisir au prochain

Sur la tombe de mes gens
Sur la tombe de mes gens

Sur la tombe de mes gens
Je reverrai mon pays
Les mille collines et les vents chauds
Et les rues où j'ai tout appris
Je retrouverai mes vieux amours
Et ma première fois peut-être
Celle que j'aimerai toujours
Mais qui je crois ne doit plus être

Sur la tombe de mes gens
Je me reverrai petit homme
Grand de coeur et de courage
Mais tout petit comme tous les hommes
Prendre de l'élan sans recul
Pour se défaire d'un passé trop lours
Sans savoir que l'heure viendra
Où il faudra qu'il y retourne

Sur la tombe de mes gens
Sur la tombe de mes gens
Sur la tombe de mes gens
Sur la tombe de mes gens

Sur la tombe de mes gens
Vais-je enfin pleurer de peine
Vais-je en vouloir à la terre
D'avoir laisser vaincre la haine
Vais-je vouloir leur faire la peau
À ces maudits fils de chiennes
Les grands comme les petits bourreaux
Où vais-je rester peace quoi qu'il advienne

Corneille,"Ca fait trop lontemps qu'on attend
Beaucoup trop lontemps qu'on le sent
Pense même pas me dire qu'il est trop tôt
Ca fait trop lontemps que tu te vantes
Beaucoup trop lontemps qu'on se tente
Viens et montre-moi si on se vaut

J'voudrais pas être indécent mais,
Juste là pour un instant
J'ai osé penser a toi autrement
On peut laisser le temps au temps mais,
Mais si on sait où on mène le vent 
On pourrait le devancer 
On sait ce qui nous attend

[Chorus]
On s'est dit je t'aime 
Et on a fait le tour des mots
Viens qu'on se fatigue un peu
Viens qu'on se fatigue un peu
On s'est dit nos vies
Et avouer bien plus qu'il ne faut 
Viens qu'on se fatigue un peu
Viens qu'on se fatigue un peu

On s'est dit je t'aime

Maintenant qu'on s'est dit nos amours
Qu'on s'est ouvert chacun à son tour
Viens qu'on répète enfin du corps
Dis-moi tous comme ce que tu préfères
Dis-moi qu'on sache mieux quoi faire
Pour qu'on se désire demain, encore

Je prendrai pas la fuite demain
On s'aimera encore demain
C'est pas mon genr, ne t'inquiète pas et viens
Je serai ton petit matin
Le même pour tous les lendemains 
Et dis-moi que je te rassure et viens

Corneille,"Je m'en rappelle comme hier
De toi et moi avant la guerre
Nous étions jeunes et sans souci
Et on se prenait pour acquis
A l'époque tu m'intimidais
D'ailleurs je ne t'ai jamais avoué
Ma petite flamme secrète pour toi
Mais j'en fais quoi si tu n'es plus là
Ce qui est difficile avec ce genre de rêves
Qui avant de commencer déjà s'achèvent
See'est la mémoire qui m'empêche de vivre
Don't souvent je me sers afin de survivre
Maintenant que j'why pense
J'aurai dû te dire
Tout ce que j'ai pensé alors que je ne peux qu'écrire
See'est un peu tard, do moins dans cette vie
En attendant la nôtre, je te crie

Va, va, un jour on se reverra, va
Quelque part à l'au-delà, l'histoire reprendra
Je nous le jure on se reverra
Va, va, un jour on se reverra, va
Quelque part à l'au-delà, l'amour reprendra
Je nous le jure on se reverra

Je passe ma vie à te chercher
Je pense souvent t'avoir trouvé
Mais elles ne sont jamais toi
Elles sont tout ce don't je rêve, sauf toi
8 ans après j'ai fini mon deuil
Des fois la nuit je jète un coup d'oeil
Sur ma vie si tu étais resté
Mais pas longtemps, je t'ai assez pleuré
Je sais qu'il faudrait que je te laisse partir
Mais je ne trouve de force que dans ton sourire
Tu vois, see'est la mémoire
Qui m'empêche de vivre
Don't souvent je me sers
Pour afin de survivre
Maintenant que j'why pense j'aurai dû te dire
Tout ce que j'ai pensé alors
Que je ne peux qu'écrire
See'est un peu tard,
Do moins dans cette vie
En attendant la nôtre, je te crie

Tu étais peut-être celle qui allait 
Faire de moi l'homme que je ne suis pas
Personne ne le saura
Ca fait mal de savoir qu'un jour j'aurai 
Peut-être pu renaître avec toi (me refaire à travers toi)
Ca me tue de vivre dans le passé et le regret
Mais je le fais malgré moi, oh !

Corneille,"Over time, I've been building
My castle of love
Just for two, though you never
Knew you were my reason
I've gone much too far for you
Now to say
That I've got to throw my
Castle away

Over dreams, I have picked out
A perfect come true
Though you never knew it was
Of you I've been dreaming
The sandman has come from
Too far away
For you to say come back some
Other day

And though you don't believe
That they do
They do come true
For did my dreams
Come true when I looked at you
And maybe too, if you
Would believe
You too might be
Overjoyed, over loved, over me

Over hearts, I have painfully
Turned every stone
Just to find, I had found what
I've searched to discover
I've come much too far for me
Now to find
The love that I sought can never
Be mine

And though you don't believe
That they do
They do come true
For did my dreams
Come true when I looked at you
And maybe too, if you
Would believe
You too might be
Overjoyed, over loved, over me

And though the odds
Say improbable
What do they know
For in romance
All true love needs is a chance
And maybe with a chance you
Will find
You too like I
Overjoyed, over loved, over
You, over you",Overjoyed,2005
Corneille,"Donne moi tout même quand il reste plus rien
Rend moi saoûl de toi quand rien n'est bien

Corneille,"You found me such a mess
And still, you took my hand
And held me out of numbness
Became my truest friend

I’d been running looking for a home
But when you saw me out of breath
From running on my own
Is when you kissed me out of death

Now that I’m recovering
I’m so glad for one thing only
I’m so, so glad I let you in
Because

Woman
You loved me back to life
You loved me back to life
Your love’s that powerful

No one could ever seem to bring me to fall
And God knows they’ve tried
But you could see through my wall
Even when I tried to hide

And I know it hasn’t been easy baby
And I know you hadn’t signed up to save me baby
But here we are now, and better off now, in love

I could tell of your pain too
And I’ll die trying to love it away
But this much I owe you
If I can say

Woman
You loved me back to life
You loved me back to life
Your love’s that powerful

Maybe, now you can tell me you need me to
Maybe, now I can be all that for you
Maybe, now we can finally say we do
This ain’t no ordinary love
Not when a grown man can say

You loved me back to life
You loved me back to life
Your love’s a miracle

I think I’m gonna have to say it again and again and again

You loved me back to life
You loved me back to life
Your love’s that powerful",Back to Life,2007
Corneille,"Just when fate had taken enough from me
That I almost couldn't wait for my turn

Just when secretly
I found little sense in living
And no point at all to the riches I'd earned

Ever so every word that means beautiful
Ever so every word that means wonderful
You came
Now nothing's ever tasted better than life
Nothing's ever tasted better than time

Heaven, heaven
Can wait
'Cause I got you now
Heaven, heaven
Can wait
'Cause I got you now

I would wear a smile
As make up
Just to get out and face the world

And I have stretched this smile
To make up
For an empty look
Since I wanted to charm the world

Ever so every word that means beautiful
Ever so every word that means wonderful

Now nothing's ever tasted better than life
Nothing's ever tasted better than time

To find the world in very bad shape

Freedom and his brother Faith
Had yet again made some more windows
And it was all live to tape

But then I remembered I had you

And right then I decided
If a man needs a cause to die for
Then I'll make you mine

Home is by you
Wherever I'll go
You'll stay my truth

Home is by you

I wasn't home until I missed you

And I'll be your soldier always
For home is by you

Your happiness has got to be the prize
If I ever go to war

And I'll need a promise from God
That you'll be here waiting
To look after my scars

I'm so proud to be yours
I'm writing you anthems
And I can't wait to travel the world to chant them

Maybe one day we'll have our little army
And we'll raise it to soldier for love
And isn't the only way to change the world really
To leave the next ones with a heritage of love ?

That's how I remember you

So please forgive me
If I never call you home again
Please forgive me
If I never call you home again

You looked like apocalypse
Hell and then Genesis combined
Last time I saw you
You were stripping me of anything and anyone that was mine

That's how I remember you

So please forgive me if
I never call you home again
Please forgive me

I hope I get to find it again

If there's a next time
I hope you can take care of your own

Since it's gotten sour
It's been pouring names
Now I'm all drenched up in shame

You're fallen in and out of love
So many times, you're thinking of
Maybe leaving
But that's just straight up insane

I really do believe that our love is stronger than this
Baby please don't get me wrong

Love is good
Love is good
But damn, does it ever hurt
Love is sweet
Yes love is so sweet
But damn, does it ever burn
Does it ever burn

It's been days now since we touched
Feels like a lifetime since we kissed
'Cause you said you can't stand my sight

You're throwing punches
And I'm still standing
But the truth is
We're both struggling
To remember, the better days
The better day

I really do believe that our love is stronger than this
Baby please don't get me wrong

Love is good
Love is good
But damn, does it ever hurt
Love is sweet
Yes love is so sweet
But damn, does it ever burn
Does it ever burn

Is that love and hate
Are growing into one and the same
But there's a look in you beautiful eyes
That's whispering
Love is winning

Corneille,"I was born black and free
I was born in the cold
Cold was home to me
Until I was told

I was really from the South
So I traveled closer to the sun

But you see
Flesh burning beat
Got me crossing the sea
Back to the cold again

So here I am
Here I am

I'm a stranger
Anywhere I run to
Yes I am
A stranger
And I just can't seem to
Find a race I could claim
The roots to my name
But who I am
Is a man of this world

This is my second shot
Winter's smiling at me
I'm taking this shot
To be all I can be

So the next place I stop
Will be the land of the free

A place where a million of colors and dreams dwell
Sounds like a place to me, where someone might understand
Just who I am, who I am

I'm a stranger
Anywhere I run to
Yes I am
A stranger
And I just can't seem to
Find a race I could claim
The roots to my name
But who I am
Is a man of this world

Now there's this fuss about color
And everybody needs to belong
But take a minute to consider my perspective
You see, black kicked me out once
And white took me in
But white looked at me once
And nearly spat at my skin

I'm so confused, I'm so confused
About who I should hate

I figure I'll just love them all

I'm a stranger
Anywhere I run to
Yes I am
A stranger
And I just can't seem to
Find a race I could claim
The roots to my name
But who I am
Is a man of this world

I'm a stranger
Anywhere I run to
Yes I am

Corneille,"Oh baby, you see I'm a strong man
And I have seen some dark sides of life in my days baby
But nothing, somehow nothing
Compares to this
No no baby

I ain't never been on my two knees before
And I ain't never been the kind to say please before

I'm out of options baby
And tricks to make you stay

This is not a threat
But if you walk out that door
It'll be like
Dragging my heart out in the concrete
It'll be like
Wasting my parts out in the dark streets
It'll be like murder
This will be murder

This is not a threat
But if you walk out that door
It'll be like
Leaving behind a helpless dying man
It'll be like
Simply killing me, don't you understand?
It'll be like murder
This will be murder

I've said I'm sorry
But I guess that didn't work
So I tried 'I love you'
But I guess that made it worse

Because now you're looking at me
Ever so calmly
And it's that look on your face that frightens me

'Cause that look means you've made up your mind
And that look means my crying is a waste of time

I'm out of options baby
Out of tricks to make you stay

This is not a threat
But if you walk out that door
It'll be like
Dragging my heart out in the concrete

You see, I need you to stay
Out of pity, love or lack of choice
It don't matter today

We can face reality tomorrow
But for now, just for now
Let's just run away

This is not a threat
But if you walk out that door
It'll be like
Dragging my heart out in the concrete
It'll be like
Wasting my parts out in the dark streets
It'll be like murder
This will be murder

This is not a threat
But if you walk out that door
It'll be like
Leaving behind a helpless dying man
It'll be like
Simply killing me, don't you understand?
It'll be like murder
This will be murder",Murder,2007
Corneille,"I wasn't expecting you

You've had your heart broken once

That means you know all about these kinds of things

I, on the other hand, am struggling
To make some sense out of these strange feelings

I'm dealing with insecurity, jealousy
And all sorts feelings

I'm playing hard to get
To save what's left of my defense

You're everything I ever dreamed of
So excuse me if I'm not showing off my mess

It's hard for me to show you my bad card
When you're the one I'm trying hard to impress

Just give me a little time baby
Just give me some time to learn about
All these kinds of things
Have a little patience baby

I don't know how to do this

I only had to care for me

I've had no warning
But let me say

That I will find my way
I always have, I always have

refrain (2x)

qu'est-ce qu'on a à y perdre, dis le moi
juste un peu d'égo et quelques vieilles habitudes
je n'te promets pas le bonheur, mais je suis à monmeilleur avec toi
voilà ma certitude

refrain : (2x)",Tous les Deux,2011
Corneille,"Que fera-t-on quand on aura plus de crédit pour se payer le monde
Quand le dollar tombera pour révéler le vrai coeur des hommes
Que dira-t-on quand l'Aston n'impressionnera plus personne
Imagine qu'à la radio, la vérité soit l'air qui cartonne

Refrain
Que feras-tu, le JALFDM, JALFDM
La fin du monde comme on nous l'a appris
M'aimeras-tu, le JALFDM, le JALFDM
Le matin d'une toute nouvelle vie
M'aimeras-tu 
Vi-vi-vivez vos rêves, vos rêves, oooooh x2

Que fera-t-on quand le coeur d'une jolie femme comme un laser
Percera l'habit d'un homme à cours de chance pour trouver un monsieur derrière
Que fera-t-on quand les hommes s'affoleront pour un peu plus qu'une belle image
Pour que ces majestés ne soient plus tentées de retoucher leur bel âge

Refrain
Que feras-tu, le JALFDM, JALFDM
La fin du monde comme on nous l'a appris
M'aimeras-tu, le JALFDM, le JALFDM
Le matin d'une toute nouvelle vie
M'aimeras-tu 
Vi-vi-vivez vos rêves, vos rêves, oooooh x2

Et si les promesses d'un nouveau printemps ne sont pas les signes même qu'on est bien vivant.
Il nous restera qu'à danser, danser... danser pour arrêter le temps.
Arrêter le temps !",Le  Jour Apres La Fin du Monde,2011
Corneille,"J'ai fait la liste de ce qu'on ne sera plus
Quand tu danses, quand tu danses
Mais que deviennent les amoureux perdus
Quand tu danses, y songes-tu?
Quand tu danses, y songes-tu?

Amis non, ni amants, étrangers non plus
Quand tu danses, quand tu danses
Mais quel après, après s'être appartenus
Quand tu danses, y songes-tu?
Quand tu danses, y songes-tu?

Je crois bien que j'aurai besoin de te voir
Quand tu danses, quand tu danses
Sans te parler, ni déranger, mais te voir
Quand tu danses, y songes-tu?
Quand tu danses, y songes-tu?

Et toutes les peines, toutes, contre une seule de nos minutes

Mais n'être plus rien après tant, c'est pas juste
Quand tu danses, y songes-tu?
Quand tu danses, y songes-tu?

Et j'ai fait la liste de ce qu'on ne sera plus

Mais que deviennent les amours éperdues?
Quand tu danses, y songes-tu?

Corneille,"Eh, mon paradis

Et si le bout de mes rêves, mes rêves
N'était qu'un bout de toi
Et si au bout des tes lèvres, tes lèvres
Renaissait un autre moi
Et si le bonheur qui me fait perdre haleine
N'était pas plus que ça
Et si l'amour avec toi, avec toi c'était ça
Le coup d’œil à l'au delà

Et si on n'a que la vie
Qu'est ce qu'on attend allumons le feu
Et si on n'est que la nuit
Je fais de nous mon dernier vœu
Tu n'as qu'à dire un mot
Prends le temps qu'il faut

Et si c'était toi, mon paradis
Et si c'était moi, ton paradis
Quand on fait ensemble
Nous sommes, nous sommes indéfinis
Je sais qu'ensemble
Nous sommes, nous sommes notre infini
Et si c'était ça, le paradis

Et si dans le fond de tes yeux se révélait un fond de moi
Et si dans le chaud de ton corps je retrouvais enfin la foi
Et si le malheur lui seul dit que tu ne me remarques pas
De quoi aurais-je peur maintenant, maintenant
Je le sais, je le sais que tu ne vois que moi

Tu n'as qu'à dire un mot
Prends le temps qu'il faut

Et si c'était toi, mon paradis
Et si c'était moi, ton paradis
Quand on fait ensemble
Nous sommes, nous sommes indéfinis
Je sais qu'ensemble
Nous sommes, nous sommes notre infini
Et si c'était ça, le paradis",Le  Paradis [Robin Notte Acoustic Remix],2013
Corneille,"Est-ce que tu fais le buzz
T’es où dans les charts?
Es-tu disque d’or?
T’as combien de friends et de followers?
Est-ce que tu chantes encore?
Je tente le recours
Du doux raccourci
Il faut ce qu’il faut (Il faut ce qu’il faut)
Tant qu’il est chaud je bats le fer
Mais j’y laisse ma peau
Je ne suis plus d’accord
Je ne suis plus d’accord

Les derniers seront les premiers
Les premiers seront dépassés
Parce que l'Histoire, tiendra la main du destin
Moi je bats mes propres sentiers
À genoux ou à pied
Oui à genoux ou à pied
Pour avoir les mots qu’on chantera demain
Moi je bats mes propres sentiers
Sans raccourcis
Sans raccourcis
Sans raccourcis
Sans raccourcis
Je vis ma vie
Comme je l'écris
Sans raccourcis
Sans raccourcis

Parfois le chemin le plus long
Est le chemin le plus sûr

Hier hélas
Est déjà trop loin
Vois comme on se lasse
Qu’est ce qu’on se lasse
Mais le passé
Nous rattrape toujours
Quoiqu’on en fasse
L’intégrité est-ce un luxe des hommes qui n’ont que leur nom?
La vraie vie me prendra bien des choses
Sauf mon bonheur et ma chanson

Les derniers seront les premiers
Les premiers seront dépassés
Parce que l'Histoire, tiendra la main du destin
Moi je bats mes propres sentiers
À genoux ou à pied
Oui à genoux ou à pied
Pour avoir les mots qu’on chantera demain
Moi je bats mes propres sentiers
Sans raccourcis
Sans raccourcis
Sans raccourcis
Sans raccourcis
Je vis ma vie
Comme je l'écris
Sans raccourcis
Sans raccourcis

Tu ne fais que monter l'ascension
Plus la chute est inévitable
Plus le chemin est long
Plus le succès est durable
Les étoiles sont filantes
S'envolent vers l'oubli
Se pressent vers une mort lente
À force de raccourcis
À force de stratagème
À force de tricherie
Viennent les trancher à eux-mêmes
Là j'sais encore qui j'suis
Fidèle à mes idées
Comme Corneille persuadé qu'on récolte l'amour en semant de la sincérité
Ne rêve pas ta vie, mais vis tes rêves
Méfie toi des raccourcis, la victoire y est brève
On a tellement attendu, on est plus pressé
Vu qu'on ne s'est pas perdu on finira par trouver

Sans raccourcis
Sans raccourcis
Sans raccourcis
Sans raccourcis

Les derniers seront les premiers
Les premiers seront dépassés
Parce que l'Histoire, tiendra la main du destin
Moi je bats mes propres sentiers
À genoux ou à pied
Oui à genoux ou à pied
Pour avoir les mots qu’on chantera demain

Corneille,"Un début de janvier, si j'ai bien su compter
Reste de fête ou bien vœux très appuyés
De Ruth ou de Moïshé, lequel a eu l'idée?
Qu'importe si j'ai gagné la course, et parmi des milliers
Nous avons tous été vainqueurs, même le dernier des derniers
Une fois au moins les meilleurs, nous qui sommes nés
Au creux de nos mères qu'il fait bon mûrir
Et puis j'ai vu de la lumière alors, j'suis sorti
Et j'ai dit, bonne idée
(J'ai dit, bonne idée)

Y'avait du soleil, des parfums, de la pluie
Chaque jour un nouveau réveil, chaque jour une autre nuit
Des routes et des motards et des matches de rugby
Des spaghetti, Frédéric Dard et Johnny Winter aussi
On m'a dit c'est qu'une étincelle avant l'obscurité
Juste un passage, un arc-en-ciel, une étrange absurdité
Des frères, des tendres, des trésors à chercher
Des vertiges à prendre, à comprendre et des filles à caresser
J'me suis dit, bonne idée
(Je me suis dit, bonne idée)

Et puis y'a toi qui débarque en ouvrant grand mes rideaux
Et des flots de couleurs éclatent et le beau semble bien plus beau
Et rien vraiment ne change mais tout est différent
Comme ces festins qu'on mange seul ou en les partageant
(Bonne idée)

Je marchais au hasard le soir était tombé
Avec mon sac et ma guitare j'étais un peu fatigué
Tout était si désert, où me désaltérer ?
Et puis j'ai vu de la lumière et je vous ai trouvés

Bonne idée",Bonne idée,2013
Corneille,"Sur une arme les doigts noués
Pour agresser, serrer les poings
Mais nos paumes sont pour aimer
Y'a pas de caresse en fermant les mains

Longues, jointes en une prière
Bien ouvertes pour acclamer
Dans un poing les choses à soustraire
On ne peut rien tendre les doigts pliés

Quand on ouvre nos mains
Suffit de rien dix fois rien
Suffit d'une ou deux secondes
À peine un geste, un autre monde
Quand on ouvre nos mains

Mécanique simple et facile
Des veines et dix métacarpiens
Des phalanges aux tendons dociles
Et tu relâches ou bien tu retiens

Et des ongles faits pour griffer
Poussent au bout du mauvais côté
Celui qui menace ou désigne
De l'autre on livre nos vies dans des lignes

Quand on ouvre nos mains
Suffit de rien dix fois rien
(Suffit de rien dix fois rien)
Suffit d'une ou deux secondes
A peine un geste, un autre monde
Quand on ouvre nos mains

Un simple geste d'humain
Quand se desserrent ainsi nos poings
Quand s'écartent nos phalanges
Sans méfiance, une arme d'échange
Des champs de bataille en jardin

Le courage du signe indien
Un cadeau d'hier à demain
Rien qu'un instant d'innocence
Un geste de reconnaissance
Quand on ouvre comme un écrin

Quand on ouvre nos mains
Suffit de rien dix fois rien
Suffit d'une ou deux secondes
À peine un geste, un autre monde
Quand on ouvre nos mains

Quand on ouvre nos mains
Quand on ouvre nos mains",Nos mains,2013
Corneille,"There's a place in your heart 
And I know that it is love 
And this place could be much brighter than tomorrow 
And if you really try 
You'll find there's no need to cry 
In this place you will feel there's no hurt or sorrow 

There are ways to get there 
If you care enough for the living 
Make a little space 
Make a better place 

Heal the world 
Make it a better place 
For you and for me 
And the entire human race 
There are people dying 
If you care enough for the living 
Make a better place 
For you and for me 

If you want to know why 
There's a love that cannot lie 
Love is strong, it only cares for joyful giving 
If we try, we shall see 
In this bliss we cannot feel 
Fear or dread, we stop existing and start living 

Then it feels that always 
Love is enough for us growing 
So make a better world 
Make a better world 

Heal the world 
Make it a better place 
For you and for me 
And the entire human race 
There are people dying 
If you care enough for the living 
Make a better place 
For you and for me 

And the dream we were conceived in will reveal a joyful face 
And the world we once believed in will shine again in grace 
Then why do we keep strangling life? 
Would this earth 
Crucify its soul? 
Though it's plain to see 
This world is heavenly 
Be God's glow 

We could fly so high 
Let our spirits never die 
In my heart, I feel you are all my brothers 
Create a world with no fear 
Together, we'll cry happy tears 
See the nations turn their swords into ploughshares 

We could really get there 
If you cared enough for the living 
Make a little space 
To make a better place 
 
Heal the world 
Make it a better place 
For you and for me 
And the entire human race 
There are people dying 
If you care enough for the living 
Make a better place 
For you and for me

Heal the world 
Make it a better place 
For you and for me 
And the entire human race 
There are people dying 
If you care enough for the living 
Make a better place 
For you and for me
Heal the world 
Make it a better place 
For you and for me 
And the entire human race 
There are people dying 
If you care enough for the living 
Make a better place 
For you and for me 

There are people dying 
If you care enough for the living 
Make a better place

Tiens ma tête quand elle fait plus de sens 
Et j'en ferai autant

Que je demande plus que je vaux

Corneille,"Oh, now that you're gone
Now that you're gone
I feel so unsure
As I take your hand and lead you to the dance floor
As the music dies, something in your eyes
Calls to mind the silver screen
And all its sad good-byes

I'm never gonna dance again
Guilty feet have got no rhythm
Though it's easy to pretend
I know you're not a fool
Should've known better than to cheat a friend
And waste the chance that I've been given
So I'm never gonna dance again
The way I danced with you
Oh, oh 
No, no never gonna dance again
The way I danced with you
 
Time can never mend
The careless whisper of a good friend
To the heart and mind
Ignorance is kind
There's no comfort in the truth
Pain is all you'll find

I'm never gonna dance again
Guilty feet have got no rhythm
Though it's easy to pretend
I know you're not a fool
I should've known better than to cheat a friend
And waste the chance that I've been given (no rhythm)
So I'm never gonna dance again
The way I danced with you
Oh, should have known better

Oh, tonight the music seems so loud
I wish that we could lose this crowd
Maybe it's better this way
We'd hurt each other with the things we'd want to say
We could have been so good together
We could have lived this dance forever
And no one's gonna dance with me
Please stay

I'm never gonna dance again
Guilty feet have got no rhythm

I know you're not a fool
Should've known better than to cheat a friend
And waste the chance that I've been given
I'm never gonna dance again

Don't try turning tables instead
You've taken lots of chances before
But I ain't gonna give anymore
Don't ask me
That's how it goes
'Cause part of me knows what you're thinkin'

Don't say words you're gonna regret
And don't let the fire rush to your head
I've heard the accusation before
And I ain't gonna take any more
Believe me
The sun in your eyes
Made some of the lies worth believing

I'm the eye in the sky
Looking at you
I can read your mind
I'm the maker of rules
Dealing with fools
I can cheat you blind
And I don't need to see anymore
To know that
I can read your mind, I can read your mind
Oh I can read your mind
Yes I can read your mind

Don't leave false illusions behind
And don't cry 'cause I ain't changing my mind
So find another fool like before, oh
'Cause I ain't gonna live anymore believing
Some of the lies while all of the signs are deceiving (so deceiving)

Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.

The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms

Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain

Que quieres tú que yo haga rosario de mi vida
Que quieres tu que yo haga con este corazón

Ese era mi esperanza vaya que a sus fulgores 
Pues en el hondo abismo que existe entre los dos

Adiós por la vez última amor de mis amores

Cornelio Reyna,"Que hare lejos de ti 
Prenda de mi alma
Sin verte sin ohirte
y sin hablarte

A cada instante 
Intentare por olvidarte
Porque es un imposible nuestro amor

Como quitarle el brillo 
A las estrellas
Como impedir que corra
El ancho rio

Como negar
Que sufre el pecho mio
Como
Borrar de mi alma esta pasion

(Y ya sabes que te quiero chiquitita)
Talvez el cruel destino
Nos condena
Mi bien de que me olvides
Tengo miedo

Mi corazon
Me dice ya no puedo
No puedo
Mis angustias soportar

Como quitarle el brillo

Que sufre el pecho mio
Como
Borrar de mi alma esta pasion",Prenda del Alma,1995
Cornelio Reyna,"Rodeada de amigas te encontrabas
La tarde que frente a ti pasaba
Con tristeza oí que te decían
Que baja está cayendo tu mirada

Yo sé que mi cariño haz despreciado
Mil hombres te ofrecen sus riquezas
Yo solo un corazón casi postrero
Porque yo estoy hundido en la pobreza

Las nubes por el cielo van llorando
Las aves van cantando mi tristeza
Sólo tú de mi ya no te acuerdas

Porque yo estoy hundido en la pobreza
Sólo tú de mi ya no te acuerdas
Porque yo estoy hundido en la pobreza

Ya casi no recuerdo quien me dijo
Cuidado no vayas a humillarte
Tal vez fueron palabras de mi madre
Palabras de un cariño
Que no podía engañarme

Collares de perlas te habrán dado
Dinero y amor según parece
Yo espero que el espejo te defraude
Al fin que la pobreza no envejece

Las nubes por el cielo van llorando
Las aves van cantando mi tristeza
Sólo tú de mi ya no te acuerdas

Porque yo estoy hundido en la pobreza
Sólo tú de mi ya no te acuerdas
Porque yo estoy hundido en la pobreza

Cornelio Reyna,"Yo se que al verme me muestras disgusto

Y te hace daño que a buscarte venga 
Y vas huyendo siempre de mi lado. 

Ojos que lloran sin saber de mi 
Y van llorando por el mundo entero 
Pero tu en cambio me muestras desdenes 
Y así me pagas lo que yo te quiero
Que no me quieres eso no me importa 
Que me desprecies es un bien que me haces 
Que no me quieres eso no me puede 
Que al fin y al cabo como matas mueres.

Och göra det som flera än jag funderat ut

Snart är det inspektion, här är för hett i solen

Och bara döden skördas och bryter era tält

bönder och soldater.

älskar hon sin nästa.

men inte gratis.
Och är din börda stor kan du, käre bror,
ej bli besviken.
Ångrar du dig ändå får du lov att gå
till kliniken.

Och om kärlekskval rubbar din moral
ur balansen,
till en kärleksnatt kan hon få dig att
genast ta chansen.
Helt inkognito i ett kärleksbo
får du vila.
Tätt invid sin barm håller hon dig varm
som en mila.

Hennes mun är röd. Hennes blick är död

Cornelis Vreeswijk,"Nu faller dagg och nu stiger sol
Men det kan do inte höra
Do ligger utan blus och kjol
Med läpparna mot mitt öra
”Tala nu allvar” ber do bestämt
”Du skrattar visor och sjunger skämt 
Do kan men vill inte göra
En sång om lyckan den sköra”

Nu stiger sol och nu faller dagg
För fattigt folk och för rika
Men lyckan har en förgiftad tagg
Som man bör noga undvika
Hon stannar gärna I några dar
Men när do vill hålla henne kvar
Blir hennes ögon iskalla
Och do blir bitter som galla

Så faller daggen för utan ljud
Och gräs och blader blir våta
Och varje morgon står solen brud
Fast inga brudpsalmer låta
Ann-Katarin, do ska veta att
Det finns en lycka som dör av skratt
När den dig smeka som natten
Och den är stilla som vatten

Stig upp you're sängen Ann-Katarin
Och lyssna på något viktigt
Det finns ett särskilt slags ädelt vin
Som man bör njuta försiktigt
För om man dricker det utan sans
Förlorar det sin forna glans

Cornelis Vreeswijk,"Jag ska be att få ställa upp
Med en visa om en tupp,
Som var gammal och utsliten,
Impotent och väderbiten.
Hönsen klagade och gnällde
För han dem ej tillfredställde.
Dom skrev på en petition:
Ge vår tupp förtidspension!

Vi vill ha en tupp med sting.
Den vi har han är ju ding,
Saknar lust och energi,
Saknar allt vi är förtjusta i.
Skaffa oss en ny bemanning
Annars fixar vi äggstanning.
Se nu till att det sätts fart
Ty vi blir desperata snart.

Gammeltuppen fick nog och for
Dit där inga hönor bor.
Ingen grät när han for hädan,
En ny tupp var ordnad redan.
Hönsen var så nyfikna så, men
Det var lång leveranstid på den.
Men dom fann sig I sin lott,
För dom vänta' på nåt gott. 

Tänk, när tuppen äntligen kom 
Hönsen blev som galna dom! 
Vilken kam han har - nu står den!
Vilken näbb - den e' nog hård den! 
Hönsen flängde kring I yran, 
Tuppen hade ett bestyr, han 
Men som han var frisk och sund
Fick vart höns en kärleksstund. 

Men lilla söta hönan Agda 
Hon blev blåst på ovansagda. 
Tuppen skulle just hoppa på'na, 
Agda titta you're ögonvrårna 
Men det blev ej som Agda trodde. 
Tuppen bara stod och glodde 
Tills han plötsligt med en snärt 
Slet en fjäder you're hennes stjärt. 

Agdas blod I pulsen brände, 
Hon stod still, men inget hände. 
Flera veckor efter den dagen 
Var hon den enda oskulden I hagen. 
Varje dag I alla väder 
Ryckte tuppen ut en fjäder 
Och en dag - det är synd och skam 
Titta' Agdas rumpa fram. 

Agda skämdes och grät och tjöt 
Var gång tuppen en fjäder snöt 
Och en dag blev det för mycket. 
Agda svek för det inre trycket, 
För sorgen och kärlekskvalen. 
Nästa gång han kom, blev Agda galen 
Och hon skrek ut I falsett 
Hörru do din jädra sprätt! sa hon. 

Nu vill jag ha ett ärligt svar 
Varför do mina fjädrar tar.
Varför nobbar do mig I ett kör 
Det do med dom andra hönsen gör. 
Tuppen svarade smått generat:
Do, jag älskar dig passionerat. 
Allt do ber om det skall do få 
Men jag vill ha dig naken då!",Hönan Agda,2008

Good old friend of mine
You've been reaching for yourself
For such a long time
There's so much to say
No need to explain
Just an open door for you
To come in from the rain

It's a long road
When you're all alone
And a man like you
Will always choose the long way home

There's no right or wrong
I'm not here to blame
I just want to be the one
Who keeps you from the rain
From the rain

And it looks like sunny skies
Now that I know you're alright
Time has left us older and
Wiser, I know I am

Cause I think of us
Like an old cliche
But it doesn't matter
Cause I love you anyway
Come in from the rain

And it looks like sunny skies
Now that I know you're alright
Time has left us older

Through the perishing
winter nights and days,
A funny little phrase
That means so much to me,
That you've got to be
With me heart and soul,
For on you the whole thing leans.

Come with me and leave the noisy crowds,
Sunlight shines for us above the clouds.
Please don't turn away
Or my dream will stay
Hidden out of sight,
Among a lot of ""might have beens""!

A room with a view,
And you,
And no-one to worry us,
No one to hurry us through
This dream we've found.

We'll gaze at the sky,
And try
To guess what it's all about,
Then we will figure out why
The world is round!

We'll be as happy and contented as birds upon a tree,
High above the mountains and the sea.

We'll bill and we'll coo-ooo-oo,
And sorrow will never come,
Oh, will it ever come true,
Our room with a view?

A room with a view,
And you,
And no-one to give advice,
That sounds like a paradise few
Could fail to choose.

With fingers entwined,
We'll find
Relief from the preachers
Who always beseech us to mind
Our P's and Q's.

We'll watch the whole world pass before us while we are sitting still,
Leaning on our own window sill.

An airline ticket to romantic places

Those stumbling words that told you what my heart meant

And candle lights on little corner tables

The beauty that is Spring's

How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The sigh of midnight trains in empty stations
Silk stockings thrown aside dance invitations
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!

Gardenia perfume ling'ring on a pillow
Wild strawb'ries only seven francs a kilo
And still my heart has wings

The waiters whistling as the last bar closes
The song that Crosby sings

How strange how sweet to find you still

Cornershop,"My sweet child, lay your head down
Dream the dreams that delight you
You're safe now and forever
Don't let reality blind you

My sweet child, taste the starlight
Reach your hands up to heaven
Share your dreams with the moonlight
Cherish all you've been giving

There's nothing to fear
Soon the day will appear
There's nothing to say 
Just as long as you pray

[Chorus]
It's in the eyes of the Candy Man
He owns the dark
It's in the eyes of the Candy Man
He owns the dark

May the night never find you
With a heart full of sorrow
You can close your tired eyes
Dream your dreams of tomorrow

There's nothing to fear
Soon the day will appear
Here comes the daylight
There's nothing to say
Just as long as you pray
Don't be afraid

[Chorus]

We're living in a cruel world, cruel world
Living in a cruel world, cruel world
Living in a cold dark space were we hide our face
We're living in a cruel world, cruel world
Living in a cruel world, cruel world
Don't be afraid

Cornershop,"Well, it seems like the funky days, they're back again
Funky, funky days, they're back again
And we're in vogue again
Before the gurkers get called up again

Seems like the funky days, they're back again
And the party's got a double E at the end again
We'll be armed in dungareen cords again
Happy days are here again, my friend

Been a long journey, long, long times
Many roads we couldn't climb
But once again, the name of the game is funky
And it's funky again
Seems like the funky days are back again
Funky with a why and it's back again and back again

We'll be wearin' dungareen cords again
Walkin' down that road with a smile on our faces
We'll be walkin' naked, hand in hand, down that road
With a smile on our faces, holdin' only embraces
Embraces to hold us 'cause we're getting funky again
And we're funky again

Seems like those funky days are back again
My friends will be wearing dungareen cords
Walkin' down that road again
When we say party, we mean it to end on the double E

Funky roads are back again
Funky drinks are back again
Zip-zap guns are back again
Big shoes are back again
Tax in the post is back again
Worker strikes are back again

And we'll be, and we'll be doin' the airplane wheel, dancin'
Swingin' like an airplane wheel, dancin'
Dancin' like the airplane wheel, movin'
Funky days are back again, my friends
And funky days are back again

Ben, you just show them how funky it can get
When funky days are back in vogue again

Cornershop,"I'm feeling good behind the wheel
I know it won't be too long
Two foots racing and the man made blues
I feel the magic of the man and the ghost

Checking out the animal heads in the animal kingdom
Taking acts on through the turbulent sea
It?s the truth, it?s the truth, make it be tree

To the chorus now, it'll always be tough
A beach Manhattan from the middle of the heart

I want each and all to switch your tiny mind on
I want each and all switch on your tiny mind
I want each and all to switch your tiny mind on
I want each and all switch on your tiny mind

'Cause good shit's all around good people
Don't let it get you down, good people
Good shit's all around, it?s all about, it's all around

Good shit's all around good people
Don't let it get you down, good people
Good shit's all around, it?s all about

Good people now, good shit, I'm on fire
Directing traffic on the disco floor

Well, one by one, we're gonna take you lovers on and
One by one, we're gonna take you lovers on
Eastern claps on the one and the third, and I'm thinking
It?s a mighty God, we serve

Good shit, I'm on fire

let's been waiting, I don't give up on a good thing
Heavy metal from the back of a stage
Walk into interstate with the worst attorney that helped me
Making old your mothers day

To the chorus now, it'll always be tough
A beach Manhattan from the middle of the heart

I want you each and all to switch your tiny mind on
I want you each and all switch on your tiny mind
I want you each and all to switch your tiny mind on

Born again to Asian lion

And planets up, what we have lost

Down alleys through gullys
Meeting every second hour
Never to come to terms with the [Incomprehensible]

To jeer on green goddesses

Always in touch by way of the community organ

Keep the sword hand free
Whatever is gonna be

For the 7th time
Without tumbling desire

Not yet drummer
A bold bank robber from Bowlin' Green
Was sent to the jail house yesterday
But late last night he made his getaway

He was long gone from Kentucky
Long gone, ain't he lucky?
Long gone, what I mean
A long gone John from Bowlin' Green

Long John stood on the railroad tie
Waitin' for freight train to come by
Freight train came by puffin' and flyin'
Oughta seen long John grabbin' that blind

[Chorus]

They caught him in 'Frisco to seal his fate
At San Quentin they jailed him one evening late
But out on the ocean John did escape
'Cause the guards forgot to close the Golden Gate

[Chorus]

Well, they offered a reward to bring him back
Even put bloodhounds on his track
Those doggone bloodhounds lost his scent
Now nobody knows where John went

[Chorus]

A gang of men tried to capture Dean
So they chased him with a submarine
Dean jumped overboard and grabbed the submarine
And made that gang catch a flyin' machine

He's long gone from Kentucky
A long gone, that boy's lucky
A long gone, what I mean
