The Alternate Routes,"So tell me what it's really like
When it's alright but it's just alright
I watch it get under your skin
And you can't even say what it is

But I know it's not like when you made your peace
With your former life or your dirty sheets
'Cause you're cleaner than you used to be
Everybody wants some company

Are you lonely, love?
Oh and you're the waiting around
For somebody to tell you that it's only love
And that it's better just to let it beat you

So tell me what it's all about
When you figure out that it's harder now
Out of touch now you're out of tune
It's not forever but I'm telling you

That I know love is a hate to bring home
Believe in yourself all alone
You had to slow down for a while
It's always been out of your style

Are you lonely, love?
Oh and you're the waiting around
For somebody to tell you that it's only love
And that it's better just to let it beat you

So tune it out like you always done
Tell me now would you tell the truth
Are you lonely?

Are you lonely, love?
Are you lonely, love?
Are you lonely, love?

The Alternate Routes,"Roll your windows down
The summer's nearly gone
And only hours stand between you
And the cold that's coming on

And you count your questions
In the sky lit blue
And every color there is
Telling you

Time is a runaway
Coming for you
Time is a runaway
Coming for you

In my dreams I see in red
She cannot stay
And the summer leaves you
Like the girl who gets away

We sit here stranded
In a careless hue
And every color that is
Telling you

Time is a runaway
It's coming for you
Time is a runaway
Coming for you

Time is a runaway
It's coming for you
Time is a runaway
She's coming for you

In the morning when I rise
She's coming on to tell me

Time is a runaway
Coming for you
Time is a runaway
Coming for you

Time is a runaway
Coming for you
Time is a runaway
Coming for you

The Alternate Routes,"I wrote a song for you
when i heard about you leaving
i was riding in my car
staring out the window
and the sun set out
on the highway
half across the country
you were riding 
with the top down
just like i knew you would be


singing California,
Can you hear me now?
Sing me a song
that i can feel, somehow
cause i dont need
another reason,
to turn it up too loud
oh noooooo, can you hear me now?

and i wrote a song for you
on the blank side
of a coaster
with a pen i had to borrow
was crawlin off the way
so i bought another round
for some girl
from out of town
and i made her feel like staying
just the way you done for me
but did you leave the top down
in that desert in the dust cloud
cause i can hear you
burning out the stars


and you were singing 
California, can you hear me now?
Sing me a song
that i can feel, somehow
cause i dont need
another reason,
to turn it up too loud
oh noooooo, can you hear me now?

so why dont you call me
when you get there
on that warm day
in november
let the sun set on the ocean
and let yourself remember

::chorus::
California,
Can you hear me now?
Sing me a song

The Alternate Routes,"I need a new distraction
Passing all the days and I see that now I'm
Fading like the sun on a windowsill
Some things never change but I know I will

And I'm looking for a new direction
I blame it on a place where I keep my questions
Had enough so long and I ask you why
All I know is indecision

But in this life I find
That there is time enough to take it
But in this life I find
That there is time enough to waste it
On these endless conversations

And I just had to write it down and tell you
Send it in a letter; tell you know that I have
Raided every page in your history
And I thought about what life could be for me

And I'm looking for a new solution
There are some things that I do get used to

Wont you say it if you can if you care for me
Tell me how it is would you talk to me
In this life I find that there is time enough to take it
And in this life I find that there is time enough to waste it
On these endless conversations

Oh, no, no, oh, no, no, oh, no, no, hey
Oh, no, no, oh, no, no, oh, no, no, hey

But in this life I find that there is time enough to take it
And in this life I find that there is time enough to waste it
On these endless conversations

",Endless Conversation,2006
The Alternate Routes,"Most days I'm burning in a fire
I got a cliche cold staring at my world
But these days the bird is on the wire
Two fingers pull a pen
Half drawn picture of a dream

And here between the writing on the wall
I try to feel forgotten for a while
And it's hard and I get angry all the time
But this is not a life I cannot change

And somewhere in the heart of the aftermath
There's an answer for me
'Cause you could have been anybody on the road to me

You say this time you needed answers
No time for second chances that we wasted long before
And I said you only see the problems
You're too afraid to solve
And so I headed for the door

And here between the writing on the wall
I try to feel forgotten for a while
And it's hard to see the shadow in a man
He is the last to see the light before it hits him where he stands

And somewhere in the heart of the aftermath
There's an answer for me
'Cause you could have been anybody on the road to me

And all this time your head is numb
And maybe you don't know
Maybe you don't know

And somewhere in the heart of the aftermath
There's an answer for me
'Cause you could have been anybody on the road to me

The Amazing Rhythm Aces,"Amazing Grace, used to be her favorite song
Lord where's my good girl gone?
She was all I ever wanted
She was an angel for sure
She stands even now in my memory
So sweet and pure
But all that made me happy
Was a bottle and a song
Used to stay out drinkin'
While she cried all night long
Amazing Grace, used to be her favorite song
Lord where's my good girl gone?

She thought she could make me
Change in awhile so she learned
How to drink and she learned how to smile
I guess the pull of the bottle 
Was just a little bit to strong
Now she's left me and 
I don't know where she's gone
Amazing Grace, used to be her favorite song

And then one night she said ""I'm goin'""

And I can see it all
I know I'm to blame for her part

He was staring at his coffee cup,

They both knew what they wanted,
There was no need to talk about it,
They were old enough to talk it out, and still keep it loose.

How do you deal with a jealous mind?
It becomes an obsession.
You think about the same things all the time, 
Love becomes possession.

I can only give you lovin' part of the time,

Maybe everybody shouldn't talk too much.

And I cannot sleep for wondering why's a rebel's cause so right
And the morphine seems to do no good at all

And I had rode a thousand horses
Always had a way with a gun

Now I'm among the horseless riders lying still
Swallowed up by the cause on the widows hill
And I dreamed about a rose in a Spanish garden
And I kissed you and I placed it in your hair

And I will run all the way just to meet you there

Looks like someone I might a seen before
Thought it musta been my imagination
When suddenly she opened up the door
""And I never expected to see you again
Must a been seven years ago
Now that you're here, why don't you come in
Don't stand outside in the snow""

She sat me down in that old rockin' chair
And she threw on another lump of coal
Said ""what's a southern boy like you, doin' here
Where the winter gets so long and cold""
""My history's a short one to tell
I've been travelin' all these seven years
I followed the music and the money around
And that's what I'm doin' up here""

A friend came down with me
I came to see about you
He came to see what he could see

In all our trials born to be our friends.
He knows our need, our weakness is no stranger,
Behold your King! Before him lowly bend!

His law is love and His gospel is peace.
Chains he shall break, for the slave is our brother.
And in his name all oppression shall cease.

It brings back the sound of music so tender,
It brings back a night of tropical splendor,
It brings back a memory ever green.
I'm with you once more under the stars,
And down by the shore an orchestra's playing
And even the palms seem to be swaying
When they begin the beguine.
To live it again is past all endeavor,
Except when that tune clutches my heart,
And there we are, swearing to love forever,
And promising never, never to part.
What moments divine, what rapture serene,
Till clouds came along to disperse the joys we had tasted,
And now when I hear people curse the chance that was wasted,
I know but too well what they mean;
So don't let them begin the beguine
Let the love that was once a fire remain an ember;
Let it sleep like the dead desire I only remember
When they begin the beguine.
Oh yes, let them begin the beguine, make them play
Till the stars that were there before return above you,
Till you whisper to me once more,
Darling, I love you!
And we suddenly know What heaven we're in,

Upon a ridge he rested as he went along his way
When all at once a mighty herd of red-eyed cows he saw
A'plowin' through the ragged skies and up a cloudy draw

For he saw the riders comin' hard and he heard their mournful cry

On horses snortin' flame an' fire, as they ride on, hear them cry

For what else could the ingenue
And the juvenile reprise
And so I wrote a random note

A night in Shangril of ecstasy
Lanterns of gold
Lanterns of blue
Twinkle in the shadows
While I dance with you
An echo in the wind

Across the summer lake
Is sayin' you should know

 At every Tom, Dick, and Joe

On the feast of Stephen,
When the snow lay round about,
Deep and crisp and even.

Though the frost was cruel,
When a poor man came in sight,
Gathering winter fuel.

Hither, page, and stand by me.
If thou know it telling:
Yonder peasant, who is he?
Where and what his dwelling?
Sire, he lives a good league hence,
Underneath the mountain,
Right against the forest fence
By Saint Agnes fountain.

Bring me flesh, and bring me wine.
Bring me pine logs hither.
Thou and I will see him dine
When we bear the thither.
Page and monarch, forth they went,
Forth they went together
Through the rude wind's wild lament
And the bitter weather.

Sire, the night is darker now,
And the wind blows stronger.
Fails my heart, I know not how.
I can go no longer.
Ark my footsteps my good page,
Tread thou in them boldly:
Thou shalt find the winter's rage
Freeze thy blood less coldly.

In his master's step he trod,
Where the snow lay dented.

Are pressed against yours
Then you'll know, yes, you'll know

""It's you I adore""

Don't think with your mind

Are sharing a sigh
We know, you can't miss it, yes, we know",Can Anyone Explain?,2008

If you part my hair with a chair, they'll spread the news to Timbuktu

You understand, I'm just a man

I get up and give some more
Until there's nothing left of me
Just some bones stacked on the floor

But every song's a two way street
I give to you, you give to me
And as long as it remains
I will still hold my heavy feet

Because you're all worth every word
And you are all here in my heart
As I awaken just again
To avoid falling apart

I give it all and when I fall

But we can't always fucking win
We can always turn the tide
We can all stand up and sing 'never alone'

We fight together, not alone
No matter where our bodies roam
This place is now what we call home

Never alone, never apart
We found each other in the dark
Shed our tears and fight our fears
We are one, the lonely hearts

Never alone, never apart

When I lost my home and find my way home
We can always turn the tide

Hello, are you there, with me?
I'm just trying to get in touch man.
I've been so fucking, so fucking down lately.
Like, I don't know what's happening, I'm just so tired all of time.
Trying to sleep' I just, I just lay there quiet.
Can't speak 'cause everyone around me is passed out.
My fucking mind's raging.
Oh, hello?
I don't even know why I called.
I think it, I think it might be time for me to leave.
Call it quits, I'm sick of this.
It's the same fucking day, every day.
I think I breathe, I can't be sure though.
It's all the same now, drink, drink, drink again.
I'm sorry man, I think it, you don't want to heat this.
I'm a mess, I'm sorry man, I just don't know who to turn to.

At a place that you could walk across with five steps down

When I wake the things I dreamt about you last night makes me blush
And you kiss me like a lover then you sting me like a viper

To bring your heart back to my island as the sand beneath me slips
As I burn up in your presence and I know now how it feels
To be weakened like Achilles with you always at my heels

The And/Ors,"Hello darkness, my old friend
I've come to talk with you again
Because a vision softly creeping
Left its seeds while I was sleeping
And the vision that was planted in my brain
Still remains
Within the sound of silence

In restless dreams I walked alone
Narrow streets of cobblestone
'Neath the halo of a street lamp
I turned my collar to the cold and damp
When my eyes were stabbed by the flash of a neon light
That split the night
And touched the sound of silence

And in the naked light I saw
Ten thousand people, maybe more
People talking without speaking
People hearing without listening
People writing songs that voices never share
No one dared
Disturb the sound of silence

""Fools"" said I, ""You do not know
Silence like a cancer grows
Hear my words that I might teach you
Take my arms that I might reach you""
But my words like silent raindrops fell
And echoed in the wells of silence

And the people bowed and prayed
To the neon god they made
And the sign flashed out its warning
In the words that it was forming

And the sign said, ""The words of the prophets
Are written on the subway walls
And tenement halls""
And whispered in the sounds of silence",The Black Diamond Prince,1994

And walk when not able
And fight till the end

Hoping ev'ry cloud will be silver lined.
But we all return as we live wo learn,
That we left our happiness behind.

When they sing you ""Look for the Silver Lining,""
It is silver dollars they're looking for.
You will find my friend that the rainbow's end,
Is somewhere around your kitchen door.

The bird with feathers of blue, is waiting for you,
Back in your own back yard,
You'll see your castle in Spain, through your window pane,
Back in your own back yard.
Oh you can go to the East go to the West,
But someday you'll come weary at heart back where you started from,
You'll find your happiness lies, right under your eyes,
Back in your own backyard.",Back in Your Own Back Yard,1976

To see Queenie the cutie of the burlesque show
And the thrill of the evening is when out Queenie skips
And the band plays the polka while she strips

""Take it off,"" ""Take it off"" Cries a voice from the rear
""Take it off,"" Take it off"" Soon it's all you can hear
But she's always a lady even in pantomime
So she stops! And always just in time

She's as fresh and as wholesome as the flowers in May
And she hopes to retire to the farm someday
But you can't buy a farm until you're up in the chips
So the band plays the polka while she strips

""Down in front"" ""Down in front"" while the band beats it out
But she's always a lady even in pantomime
So she stops! And always just in time

Queenie, someday you'll fall
Someday church bells will chime
In strip polka time

Oh! She hates corny waltzes and she hates the gavotte
And there's one big advantage if the music's hot
It's a fast moving exit just in case something rips
So the band plays the polka while she strips

Drop around, take it in, it's the best in the west
""Take it off,"" ""Take it off"" you can yell like the rest
Take her out when it's over, she's a peach when she's dressed

It brings back a night of tropical splendor

And down by the shore an orchestra's playing 
And even the palms seem to be swaying, oh swaying

And there we are, swearing to love forever
And promising never, never to part

Till clouds came along to disperse the joys we had tasted
And now when I hear people curse the chance that was wasted
I know but too well, I know too well just what they mean, too well what they mean

I'm doin' my bit down here for Uncle Sam
I'm a patriotic jitterbug
Yeah, yeah, that's what I am
 
I'm gettin' corns for my country, you should see the pounds fly
I'm gettin' down the waistline and I don't even try
I don't need a Duberry or a Westmore course
'Cause my weight's been taken over by the Army Air Force
 
We're not petite as sweet Joan Leslie, but then we never mind
When those GI's knock the South, we're glad that we're the healthy kind
The way those cowboys from the prairie expect us to sashay
I think I'd rather two step with their horses any day
 
We're gettin' corns for our country though the goin' is tough
When we think we can't go on, we find we can't get enough
So if you hear of a soldier, sailor or marine
Tell him to look us up at the Hollywood Canteen
 
I used to be aesthetic, they say, oh yes I was, really I was
I served the drama, arts and the ballet
But the theatre guild came over and said, forget about Pavlova
Learn to cut a rug, so now we're jitterbugs
 
I'm gettin' corns for my country, so I'm really all in

The Andrews Sisters,"Oh, say, can you see, by the dawn's early light,
What so proudly we hail'd at the twilight's last gleaming?
Whose broad stripes and bright stars, thro' the perilous fight,
O'er the ramparts we watch'd, were so gallantly streaming?
And the rockets' red glare, the bombs bursting in air,
Gave proof thro' the night that our flag was still there.
O say, does that star-spangled banner yet wave
O'er the land of the free and the home of the brave?

On the shore dimly seen thro' the mists of the deep,
Where the foe's haughty host in dread silence reposes,
What is that which the breeze, o'er the towering steep,
As it fitfully blows, half conceals, half discloses?
Now it catches the gleam of the morning's first beam,
In full glory reflected, now shines on the stream:
'Tis the star-spangled banner: O, long may it wave
O'er the land of the free and the home of the brave!

And where is that band who so vauntingly swore
That the havoc of war and the battle's confusion
A home and a country should leave us no more?
Their blood has wash'd out their foul footsteps' pollution.
No refuge could save the hireling and slave
From the terror of flight or the gloom of the grave:
And the star-spangled banner in triumph doth wave
O'er the land of the free and the home of the brave.

O, thus be it ever when freemen shall stand,
Between their lov'd homes and the war's desolation;
Blest with vict'ry and peace, may the heav'n-rescued land
Praise the Pow'r that hath made and preserv'd us as a nation!
Then conquer we must, when our cause is just,
And this be our motto: ""In God is our trust""
And the star-spangled banner in triumph shall wave
O'er the land of the free and the home of the brave!",The Star Spangled Banner,1995

But when you dance it with a new love, there's a true love in her eye

Its theme is a kiss and a sigh
You dream of a new Carioca
When music and lights are gone we say goodbye

Two heads together, they say are better than one
Two heads together, that's how the dance is begun
Two arms around you and lips, that's why I'm yours and you are mine
And you are mine

Now that you've done the Carioca
You'll never care to do the Polka
And then you'll realize the blue hula and bamboola are through

Tomorrow morning you'll discover
You're just a Carioca lover
And when you dance it with each new love, there'll be true love just for you

The Andrews Sisters,"This song is a train song, it's a song about a train
Not the Atchison, Topeka, not the Chattanooga Choo-Choo
Nor the one that leaves at midnight for the state of Alabam'
This song is a train song where the engineer is Uncle Sam

Here comes the Freedom Train
You better hurry down
Just like a Paul Revere
It's comin' into your home town

Inside the freedom train
You'll find a precious freight
Those words of liberty
The documents that made us great

You can shout your anger from a steeple
You can shoot the system full of holes
You can always question ""We the People""
You can get your answer at the polls

That's how it's always been
And how it will remain
So long as all of us
Keep riding on the Freedom Train

You can write the President a letter
You can even tell him to his face
If you think that you can do it better
Get the votes and you can take his place

You can hate the laws that you're obeying
You can shout your anger to the crowd
We may disagree with what you're saying
But we'll fight to let you say it loud",The Freedom Train,1996

Before you go to Buffalo to Baltimore or Borneo 
To Eastern Pennsylvania or Japan 
Go west! Young man 

If you go to that land, sonny 
You will have a lot of money 
If you bring the money with you when you come 
To the lone prairie, yippi-yi, yippi-yi

Before you read a travel ad 
And scamper off to Trinidad 
Too often in New York and Yucatan

In the West the natives grow up 
And I guarantee you go nuts if you come

And she don't do nothing 
And she don't know nothing

And a cowboy, for she's just keeps rolling along 

Go west! Young man 
Go where the airport's tearing the chest, young man 
You can ride a bucking bronco or a pony 
You can cut a calf in half and make baloney 
Go west! Young man 
Go right up there and give 'em the very best you can 
Don't go east, don't go south, don't go north, have a care 
Don't go up, don't go down, don't go here, don't go there 
If it's true what they say about Dixie 
Go West! Young man 

Go out and till the soil there 
Dig for gold and you'll find oil there 
Where the crow flies, where the snow flies, go, there's no ""no""! 
If you are fond of hunting there's no place that can compare 
You may not bag a lion or a tiger or a bear 
But if you want a jack-ass there are plenty of them there

The judges there are very fair, they always are of course!

The cowboy got the children and the Mrs got the horse

All to a tiny stable on that night, Holy night

I know they're watching me, always near, always near
I love the Christmas gifts and the trimming of the tree

Makes me wanta blow my top 'til the end of time

And if you feel that way, tell me what you say?

You can't be from Weehawken, hmm hmm, Delaware

You got a line of jive that's really zoo
Well I'll dig you later, baby you're all root

And you really know your stuff

Get away from living in the streets,
Where dirty money is the game, the dealer never knows your name,
People marching to the same old beat.
The street's alive with pretty girls, who take you all around the
World, if you've got enough to pay the price,
Neon lights, they beckon you, come and see what we can do,
Watch a colour movie, ain't it nice?

Take me from the heat, take me from this city streets
Take me, take me home -- take me home.

Fight, doing what I did the night before,
Hanging 'round the alley way, wandering down by the bay,
Watching drunken sailors trying to score.

Draw back te veil, bare your stonenity, your bleeding gums
You look in the looking glass before you look outside
Stand and stare your fish-eye's open wide
Live along the hour glass, don't need no alibi
The tragic end that's just begun
There's a shodow in your eye
The day is only half past, you might see eye to eye
But who'd make love to and outcast?
Take off your jewel of jewels, where's your social war?
Just don't leave your wet footprints on my bedroom door
You look at the lightning, you do not blink

To suffer much -- it's gone too far

Toothless jaws gumming melancholy stuff

A burst of rapid fire Spanish from a window up above

Students out to pose in studied disarray

Books of Sartre, Marcuse openly displayed

Waiting for, Mr. Damage


Mr. Damage, walks through the doors of the sacrificial church

Mr. Damage, meets you in the lobby then leaves you in the lurch

Mr. Damage, stands at the altar, Sermon of the search

Resident winos stumbling and lurching

Walking cadavers smiling and searching

Man in the DT's looking at the feeble glossy portraits of long dead celebrated people

Waiting for Mr. Damage


Trying hard just to keep a candle lit

A leather flyer leaves the subway anxious to admit

That the marvelled one so recently deposed was seen

Three days later in a brand new suit of clothes

A brand new suit of clothes for a very special day

They know once is nothing when you need it twice
Take care of desire, beware of the bad nights
Make sure that you feel alright because

When you said you wanted aces and eights
You added fire to the joker's curse
You volunteered to return for more
Well he's got you now for better of for worse

Well he's got you now for better of for worse
Doing time on your own, can't see where you're goin'
Your precious fantasy still leves you lonely
In the night, do you wait for the time to pass?
In the night, do you make love to your looking glass?
Night come early when you're lonely
Night comes early when you are alone

Home movies, cold U.V.'s more groovies
Waiting for a ticket of leave
Some learners get nervous, the perverts
All want to play with Eve
Sat back to look at your cracked actors
Drowning in a sea of smiles
Blue doorways lead four ways they always
Said you were a lonely child
Poor baby, poor baby
Poor baby, too tough to talk to me
Inspection, correction, rejection
Caught in a cul-de-sac
Ignition, collision, admission
That you want to double back
Poor baby, don't listen, had visions
What life is really like
You waited, debated, delayed it
Then you shut your eyes
Poor baby, poor baby
Poor baby, too tough to talk to me
You found out, your big out leaves no doubt
You've lost your head in the skies!
Striped lady, she's crazy, picks daisies
She's got the neon eyes
Give money, it's funny you dummy
Baked your cake and ate it too
The truth is that sometimes
Just one time can be enough with you!
Poor baby, poor baby
Poor baby, too tough to talk to me

About his wife, her name is Maudie
Everytime he has an argument with her
He has to write a new verse to keep her happy
He was over here at London a short while back
And he taught me this song .......""

Oh Maudie, baby, I love you
Mmm, baby, I love you
Yeah, you've been gone so long
Girl, I miss you so
Oh Maudie, why did you hurt me?
Mmm, Maudie, I said why did you hurt me?
You know I need your sweet lovin' like a flower needs the rain
Sometimes when they'd have an argument
He'd take her by the hand and say,
""Maudie, you know I love you
You know I need you
And I got just one thing to say baby - ho!""
Hey Maudie, baby don't you know I love you 
Oh, Maudie, I said baby don't you know I love you
I've been gone so long, God, I miss you so much
Sometimes Johns old lady
She'd turn around to him and say,
""John, if you don't quit your messin' around baby,
I'm gonna walk right outta that door
With my bag in my hand.""
John would say, ""Hey!""
Well, Maudie, sweet little girl, baby,

The bell tolls 
The black plague has struck
Diseased eyes roll upwards
As if knowing which direction their souls will travel
(bring out your dead)

A woman in black cries
As the deathly procession passes by
And monks moan en masse

[Gregorian chants]

The yet clean peasant pounds upon the castle door
For it is safer inside the walls
Their knocking pounds a dull tone across the quiet, deserted courtyard
The bodies of unfortunates bloat in the hot sun outside the castle walls
And ones ignorant of all facts plunder the diseased corpses for remaining riches.
(bring out your dead)

And the bell tolls on
A man walks around the castle walls on the outside
The light from his lamp dancing shadows as he moves
He tends the sick
Gives comfort to all he can for dying woman and crying man
But he feels it most for the children
(unclean)

Tears glisten on his cheek
Did man ever deserve this death?
And not all will die, just the poor 
For the rich are inside the castle walls
And he knows he could be with them
And they laugh at this fool of a man 
Through the stone fortress windows
And the bell tolls on
(unclean)

And many deaths and many days later
Many tears have been cry cried but in vain 
For tears can never erase the pain of death
Only time has that talent
His hands are now blistered but this man walks on
The only element of sanity that the people look to him for answers and he answers all
And the bell tolls on inside the castle wall
(bring out your dead)

The dead are now buried and the plague is at its end
Life for the people flowers again
They breathe fresh air like they did once before
And there is not a sound from beyond the castle walls
The bell has stopped

And only silence is heard
And the peasants outside wonder what happened within
In their bones they feel something is wrong
The bell has been silent much too long
For many days not one soul has stirred from the stone fortress where the rich people live
No one came and no one went
Fear can do many strange things

And even though water ran low
Their mouths burnt and belly's caked dry
Not one person put a foot outside
No one had that much courage
For they feared the peasants and their world outside
So they played it safe and didn't move
But one by one they perished and died",The Black Plague,1967

crowd
Ten thousand electric guitars were grooving real loud, 
yeah

You want to find the truth in life
Don't pass music by
And you know I would not lie, no I would not lie, 
No, I would not lie
Down in Monterey

Three days of understanding of moving with one another
Even the cops grooved with us
Do you believe me, yeah?
Down in Monterey

I think that maybe I'm dreaming
Monterey
Down in monterey
Did you hear what I said?",Monterey [Single Version][*],1968
The Animals,"Orange and red beams 
In and out
Peek through my window
In the night
The baby was born
Before a storm
And now I believe them
What they said
The thousand people 
Who aren't really dead
The baby was born 
Before a storm
And now a fate calls him a mile away
'Cause orange and red beams
Yes, are here to stay
Now I believe him 
Before I escape
The thousand people
Do not really care
The baby was born
Before a storm
Orange and red beams, orange and red beams
Orange and red beams, orange and red beams
Orange and red beams, orange and red beams",Orange and Red Beams,1968
The Animals,"River Deep, Mountain High Lyrics
When you were a young girl
Did you have a rag doll
The only doll you ever owned
Well you can treat me 
The way you used to treat that rag doll
But hurry up cause I'm gettin' old
And I get older baby, day by day
And it gets stronger baby, let me say
And it goes deeper baby,
Than you'll ever know
Stand back baby, and watch my love grow
And do I love you, my oh my
River deep, mountain high
If I lost you would I cry
Bet your life, baby
When you were a young girl
Did you have a puppy
That always followed you around
Well you can treat me 
The way you used to treat that puppy, baby
I swear I'll never put you down, no I won't
And I get thankful baby, in every way
And it gets less painful baby, let me say
And I'm gonna love you every night and day
Look out baby, my love way is comin' your way
Yes it is
And do I love you my oh my
River deep, mountain high
And if I lost you would I cry
Bet your life, baby
I love you baby like a flower needs the spring
I love you baby like Aretha Franklin needs to sing
And I love you baby like a schoolboy loves his pie
I love you baby, river deep, mountain high
Well take it higher, higher","River Deep, Mountain High",1969
The Animals,"It took me a long time, to find out my mistakes
Took me a long time, to find out my mistakes
(It sho' did man)
But I bet you my bottom dollar, I'm not fattenin' no more frogs for snakes

I found out my downfall, back in nineteen and thirty
(I started checkin')
I found out my downfall, from nineteen and thirty
I'm tellin' all of my friends, I'm not fattenin' no more frogs for snakes

All right now... (solo)
Yeh it is nineteen and fifty-seven, I've got to correct all of my mistakes
Whoa man, nineteen and fifty-seven, I've got to correct all of my mistakes
I'm tellin' my friends includin' my wife and everybody else,
Not fattenin' no more frogs for snakes",Fattening Frogs for Snakes,1976
