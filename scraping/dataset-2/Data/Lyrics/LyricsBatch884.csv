Ray Brown,"I love the East, I love the West
North and South, their both the best
But I only want go there as a guest
Cause I love being here with you

I love the sea, I love the shore
I love the rocks and what is more
You and they never be a bore
Cause I love being here with you

Singing in the shower
Laughing by the hour
Life is such a breezy game
I love all kinds of weather
As log as we're together
Oh I love to hear you say my name

I love good wine, fine cuisine
Candle light I love the scene
Cause baby if you know just what I mean
I love being here with you",I Love Being Here with You,1995
Ray Brown,"I got a guy who's always late
Every time we have a date
But I love him
Yes I love him

I am going to walk right up to his gate
To see if I can get it straight
Cause I want him
Oh yes I'm gonna ask him

Is you is or is you ain't my baby
The way your acting lately makes me doubt
You have always been my baby, baby
Seems the flame in your heart has gone out

Well a fellow is a creature
Who has always been strange
Just when you think you're his
He's gone and made a change

Is you is or is you ain't my baby
Has my baby found somebody new

Or is my baby still my baby too",Is You Is or Is You Ain't My Baby?,1995
Ray Brown,"There is no greater love
Than what I feel for you
No greater love,
No heart so true

Than what you bring to me
No sweeter song
Than what you sing to me

You're the sweetest thing
I have ever known
And to think that
You are mine alone.

There is no greater love
In all the world, it's true
No greater love

Ray Brown,"How come you do me like you do do do?
How come you do me like you do?
Why do you try to make me feel so blue?
I've done nothing to you.
Do me right or else just let me be.
'Cause I can beat you doing what you're doing to me.
How come you do me like you do do do?
How come you do me like you do?

Ray Brown,"What makes me treat you the way I do 
Gee, baby ain't I good to you 
There's nothing in the world 
Too good for a girl that's good and true

Ray Brown,"Each time I look at you is like the first time
Each time you're near me the thrill is new
And there is nothing that I wouldn't do for
The rare delight of the sight of you for

The more I see you, the more I want you
Somehow this feeling just grows and grows
With every sigh I become more mad about you
More lost without you and so it goes

Can you imagine how much I love you?
The more I see you as years go by
I know the only one for me can only be you
My arms won't free you, my heart won't try

Ray Brown,"You're my everything underneath the sun
You're my everything rolled up into one
You're my only dream, my only real reality
You're my idea of a perfect personality

Ray Brown,"The song a robin sings,
Through years of endless springs,
The murmur of a brook at evening tides.
That ripples through a nook where two lovers hide.

That great symphonic theme,
That's Stella by starlight,
And not a dream,
My heart and I agree,
She's everything on this earth to me.

Ray Brown,"My old flame
I can't even think of his name
But it's funny now and then
How my thoughts go flashing back again
To my old flame
My old flame
My new lovers all seem so tame
For I haven't met a gent
So innocent or elegant
As my old flame

I've met so many men
With fascinating ways
A fascinating gaze in their eyes
Some who sent me up to the skies
But their attempts at love
Were only imitations of
My old flame
I can't even think of his name
But I'll never be the same
Until I discover what became
Of my old flame

I've met so many men

Ray Brown,"Spring is here! Why doesn't my heart go dancing?
Spring is here! Why isn't the waltz entrancing?
No desire, no ambition leads me
Maybe it's because nobody needs me
Spring is here! Why doesn't the breeze delight me?
Stars appear, why doesn't the night invite me?
Maybe it's because nobody loves me
Spring is here I hear

Ray Brown,"Lullaby of Birdland, that's what I 
Always hear when you sigh
Never in my wordland 
Could there be ways to reveal
In a phrase how I feel

Have you ever heard two turtle doves
Bill and coo when they love?
That's the kind of magic 
Music we make with our lips when we kiss

And there's a weepy old willow
He really knows how to cry
That's how I'd cry in my pillow
If you should tell me farewell and goodbye

Lullaby of Birdland whisper low
Kiss me sweet and we'll go
Flyin' high in Birdland
High in the sky up above
All because we're in love",Lullaby of Birdland,1997
Ray Brown,"No one here can love or understand me
Oh, what hard luck stories they all hand me
Pack up all my cares and woe, here I go, winging low
Bye, bye, blackbird

Where somebody waits for me
Sugar's sweet, so is she
Bye, bye, blackbird

No one here can love or understand me
Oh, what hard luck stories they all hand me
Make my bed and light the light, I'll arrive late tonight

Ray Brown,"A fine romance, with no kisses
A fine romance, my friend this is
We should be like a couple of hot tomatoes
But you're as cold as yesterday's mashed potatoes

A fine romance, you won't nestle
A fine romance, you won't wrestle
I might as well play bridge
With my old maid aunt
I haven't got a chance
This is a fine romance

A fine romance, with no kisses
A fine romance, my friend this is
We two should be like clams in a dish of chowder
But we just fizz like parts of seidlitz powder

Yes, a fine romance, with no glitches
A fine romance, with no beaches
Just as hard to land as the Isle de France
I haven't got a chance
This is a fine romance

A fine romance, my good fellow
You take romance, I'll take jello
You're calmer than the seals
In the arctic ocean
At least they flap their fins
To express emotion

A fine romance with no quarrels
With no insults and all morals
I've never mussed the crease
In your blue serge pants
I never get the chance
This is a fine romance

Yes, a fine romance, my dear judges
Two old fogies who need crutches
True love should have the thrills
That a healthy crime has
Oh we don't have the thrills
That the march of time has

A fine romance, my good woman
My strong aged in the wood, woman
You never give the orchids I sent a glance
No you like cactus plants
This is a fine romance

A fine romance, my dear duchess
Two old fogies who need crutches
True love should have the thrills
That a healthy crime has
You know Louie we don't have half the thrills
That the march of time has

You're telling me
Fine romance, my very good woman
My strong aged in the wood woman
You never give the orchids I sent a glance
No I prefer cactus plants
This is a fine romance",A Fine Romance,1997

Ray Brown,"Times have changed
And we've ofter rewound the clock
Since the puritans got a shock
When they landed on Plymouth rock
If today any shock they might try to stem
'Stead of landing of Plymouth rock
Plymouth rock would land on them

In olden days a glimpse of stocking
Was looked on as something shocking
But now God knows
Anything goes

Good authors to
Who once knew better words
Now only use four letter words
Writing prose
Anything goes

If driving fast cars you like
If low bars you like
If old hymns you like
If bare limbs you like
If Mae West you like
Or me undressed you like
Why nobody will oppose

When every night
The set thats smart
Is intruding on nudist parties
In studios
Anything goes

When Mrs. Ned McClean God bless her
Can get Russian reds to yes her
Than I suppose
Anything goes

When Rockafeller still can hoard
Enough money to let Max Gordon
Produce his shows
Anything goes

The world has gone mad today
And good's bad today
And black's white today
And days night today
And that gent today
You gave a cent today
Once owned several chateaux

When folks
Who still can ride in Jitney's
Find out Vanderbilts and Whitney's
Lack baby clo'es
Anything goes

When Sam Goldwyn
Can with great conviction
Instruct Anna Sten in diction
Than Anna shows
Anything goes

When you hear that
Lady Mendl standing up
Now turns a handspring landing up
On her toes
Anything goes

Just think of those shocks you've got
And those knocks you've got
And those blues you've got
From those news you've got
And those pains you've got
(if any brains you've got)
From those little radios

So Mrs. R.
With all her trimmin's
Can broadcast a bed from Simmon's
Cause Franklin knows
Anything goes",Anything Goes,1997
Ray Brown,"Pride, sad, splendid liar,  
Sworn enemy of love
Kept my lips from saying
Things I was thinking of.
But now my pride you've humbled,
I've cast it to the winds,
Broken, beaten, sick at heart
My confession begins.
 
We've played the game of stay away
But it cost more that I can pay.
Without you I can't make my way,
I surrender, dear.

I may seem proud, I may act gay,
It's just a pose, I'm not that way,
'Cause deep down in my heart I say
I surrender, dear.

Little mean things we were doing
Must have been part of the game,
Lending a spice to the wooing,
But I don't care who's to blame.
When stars appear and shadows fall,
Why then you'll hear My poor heart call,
To you my love, my life, my all
I surrender, dear.

Ray Brown,"Comes a rainstorm, put your rubbers on your feet

Comes love, nothing can be done

Comes a fire, then you know just what to do
Blow a tire, you can buy another shoe
Comes love, nothing can be done

A telephone that rings but who's to answer?

And candle lights on little corner tables

The beauty that is Spring's

Silk stockings thrown aside dance invitations

Wild strawb'ries only seven francs a kilo

The waiters whistling as the last bar closes
The song that Crosby sings
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me

Remain to love until they droop and die

The world thought the heights were too high to climb

How many, many times the worm had turned

They all laughed when edison recorded sound
They all laughed at wilbur and his brother

They told marconi
Wireless was a phony

They laughed at me wanting you
Said I was reaching for the moon
But oh, you came through
Now they'll have to change their tune

They all said we never could be happy
They laughed at us and how!
But ho, ho, ho!
Who's got the last laugh now?

They all laughed at fulton and his steamboat
Hershey and his chocolate bar

Ford and his lizzie
Kept the laughers busy
That's how people are
They laughed at me wanting you
Said it would be, ""hello, goodbye.""
But oh, you came through
Now they're eating humble pie

Traveling south so wide and high
Sailing through the wide blue yonder

Listen to the motors humming
She is streaking through the sky
Like a bird that's flying homeward
It's that Airmail Special on the fly

Over plains and high dark mountains
Over rivers deep and wide
Carrying mail to California

Hear her moan and cough and sigh

I might as well play bridge
With my old maid aunt
I haven't got a chance
This is a fine romance

A fine romance, my good fellow
You take romance, I'll take jello
You're calmer than the seals
In the arctic ocean
At least they flap their fins
To express emotion

With no insults and all morals
I've never mussed the crease
In your blue serge pants
I never get the chance

Ray Brown,"The summer wind came blowin' in
From across the sea
It lingered there to touch your hair 
And walk with me

All summer long
We sang a song
And then we strolled that golden sand
Two sweethearts
And the summer wind 

Like painted kites, those days and nights
They went flying by
The world was new
Beneath the blue
Umbrella sky 

Then softer than
The piper man
One day, it called to you
I lost you to
The summer wind 

The autumn wind
And the winter wind
They have come and they have gone
And still the days
Those lonely days
Go on and on

And guess who sighs a lullaby
To nights that never end?

The summer wind
Mmm the summer wind

Ray Brown,"Thanks for the memory
Of sentimental verse,
Nothing in my purse,
And chuckles
When the preacher said
For better or for worse,
How lovely it was.

Thanks for the memory
Of Schubert's Serenade,
Little things of jade
And traffic jams
And anagrams
And bills we never paid,
How lovely it was.

We who could laugh over big things
Were parted by only a slight thing.
I wonder if we did the right thing,
Oh, well, that's life, I guess,
I love your dress.

Thanks for the memory
Of faults that you forgave,
Of rainbows on a wave,
And stockings in the basin
When a fellow needs a shave,
Thank you so much.

Thanks for the memory
Of tinkling temple bells,
Alma mater yells
And Cuban rum
And towels from
The very best hotels,
Oh how lovely it was.

Thanks for the memory
Of cushions on the floor,
Hash with Dinty Moore,
That pair of gay pajamas
That you bought
And never wore.

We said goodbye with a highball,
Then I got as high as a steeple,
But we were intelligent people,
No tears, no fuss,
Hooray for us.

Strictly entire nous,
Darling, how are you?
And how are all
Those little dreams
That never did come true?

Awfully glad I met you,

Thank you,
Thank you so much.",Thanks for the Memory,2008

Ray Brown,"Like the beat beat beat of the tom-tom
When the jungle shadows fall
Like the tick tick tock of the stately clock
As it stands against the wall
Like the drip drip drip of the raindrops
When the summer shower is through
So a voice within me keeps repeating you, you, you

Night and day, you are the one
Only you beneath the moon or under the sun
Whether near to me, or far
It's no matter darling where you are
I think of you

Day and night, night and day, why is it so
That this longing for you follows wherever I go
In the roaring traffic's boom 
In the silence of my lonely room 
I think of you

Day and night, night and day
Under the hide of me
There's an oh such a hungry yearning burning inside of me
And this torment won't be through 
Until you let me spend my life making love to you

Day and night, night and day",Night and Day,2009
Ray Brown,"Once I laughed when I heard you saying
That I'd be playing solitaire
Uneasy in my easy chair
It never entered my mind

And once you told me I was mistaken
That I'd awaken with the sun
And ordered orange juice for one
It never entered my mind
You had what I lack, myself
Now I even have to scratch my back myself

Once you warned me that if you scorned me
I'd say a lonely prayer again
And wish that you were there again
To get into my hair again
It never entered my mind

That David played, and it pleased the Lord

The baffled king composing Hallelujah

Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah

Your faith was strong but you needed proof
You saw her bathing on the roof
Her beauty and the moonlight overthrew you
She tied you to a kitchen chair
She broke your throne, and she cut your hair
And from your lips she drew the Hallelujah

Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah
You say I took the name in vain
I don't even know the name
But if I did, well really, what's it to you?
There's a blaze of light
In every word
It doesn't matter which you heard
The holy or the broken Hallelujah

Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah

I did my best, it wasn't much
I couldn't feel, so I tried to touch
I've told the truth, I didn't come to fool you
And even though it all went wrong
I'll stand before the Lord of Song
With nothing on my tongue but Hallelujah

I'm discontented with homes that are rented so I have invented my own.
Darling this place is a lover's oasis where life's weary chase is unknown.
Far from the cry of the city, where flowers pretty caress the streams,
Cozy to hide in, to love side-by-side in. Don't let it abide in my dreams.

Picture you upon my knee, just tea for two and two for tea, 
Just me for you and you for me, alone! 
Nobody near us, to see us or hear us, 
No friends or relations on weekend vacations,
We won't have it known, dear, that we have a telephone, dear. 
Day will break and you'll awake and start to bake 
A sugar cake for me to take for all the boys to see.
We will raise a family, a boy for you, a girl for me, 
Oh, can't you see how happy life would be?

You are revealing a plan so appealing I can't help but falling for you,
Darling, I planned it; can't you understand it is yours to command it, so do.
All of your schemes I'm admiring, they're worth desiring but can't you see,
I'd like to wait there for some future date dear; 
it won't be too late, dear, for me.

If your heart is in your dream
No request is too extreme
When you wish upon a star
As dreamers do
Fate is kind

She brings to those who love
The sweet fulfillment of their secret longing
Like a bolt out of the blue
Fate steps in and sees you through
When you wish upon a star
Your dreams come true",When You Wish upon a Star,1989

Ray Brown Trio,"Lately, I find myself out gazing at stars, 
Hearing guitars like someone in love.
Sometimes the things I do astound me, 
Mostly whenever you're around me.
Lately I seem to walk as though I had wings, 
Bump into things like someone in love.
Each time I look at you, 
I'm limp as a glove, 
And feeling like someone in love.",Like Someone in Love,1990
Ray Brown Trio,"A country dance was being held in a garden
I felt a bump and heard an ""Oh, beg your pardon""
Suddenly I saw polka dots and moonbeams
All around a pug-nosed dream

The music started and was I the perplexed one
I held my breath and said ""May I have the next one?""
In my frightened arms, polka dots and moonbeams
Sparkled on a pug-nosed dream

There were questions in the eyes of other dancers
As we floated over the floor
There were questions but my heart knew all the answers
And perhaps a few things more

Now in a cottage built of lilacs and laughter
I know the meaning of the words ""Ever after""
And I'll always see polka dots and moonbeams
When I kiss the pug-nosed dream",Polka Dots and Moonbeams,1990

A fairy land where no one else could enter
And in the center just you and me, dear
My heart beat like a hammer, my arms wound around you tight

An airline ticket to romantic places

And candle lights on little corner tables

The beauty that is Spring's

Silk stockings thrown aside dance invitations

Wild strawb'ries only seven francs a kilo

The waiters whistling as the last bar closes
The song that Crosby sings

Ray Bryant,"The look of love
Is in your eyes
A look your smile can't 
disguise

The look of love
Is saying so much more than
Just words could every say
And what my heart has heard
Well it takes my breath away

I can hardly wait to hold you
Feel my arms around you
How long I have waited
Waited just to love you
Now that I have found you

You've got the look of love
It's on your face
A look that time can't erase
Baby be mine, tonight

Let this be just the start of 
So many nights like this
Let's take a lovers vow
And seal it with a kiss

Don't ever go
Don't ever go
I love you so

And baby we'll seal it with a kiss

Take a sad song and make it better
Remember to let her into your heart
Then you can start to make it better

Hey Jude, don't be afraid
You were made to go out and get her
The minute you let her under your skin
Then you begin to make it better

And anytime you feel the pain, hey Jude, refrain
Don't carry the world upon your shoulders
For well you know that it's a fool who plays it cool
By making his world a little colder

Hey Jude, don't let me down
You have found her, now go and get her
Remember to let her into your heart
Then you can start to make it better

So let it out and let it in, hey Jude, begin

And don't you know that it's just you, hey Jude, you'll do

With distinguish traces
That used to be there
You could see where they'd been washed away
By too many through the day

To tempt me to madness
I thought for awhile that your poignant smile
Was tinged with the sadness
Of a great love for me

Again, I was wrong

Life is lonely again
And only last year
Everything seemed so sure
Now life is awful again
A trough full of hearts could only be a bore

A week in Paris could ease the bite of it
All I care is to smile in spite of it

I'll forget you, I will
While yet you are still

And candle lights on little corner tables

The beauty that is Spring's

How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me

Silk stockings thrown aside dance invitations

Wild strawb'ries only seven francs a kilo

The song that Crosby sings

How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me

Caught in the mix 'cause I think she's just found out
A year later, in the league like the majors
Blowing my cell, 9-1-1 on my pager
You know the flava and how it goes down
I move in and out of town
But honey now I'm homebound
Before that spot's gone you need to slow down, right now 
For better or for worse, how that sound?

[LaTocha]
I sit and ask myself
Is it really worth it
Or are you tryin' to keep playin' with my mind
I don't know why I keep dealin' with it
'cause boy your love is wicked
And I'm so tired of those same old lies

1 - 	You told me that you love me
	You told me that you care
	Said you'd always be my baby
	How could you be so unfair

	Promised never to leave me lonely
	Promised never to leave my side
	Boy you turned your back on me
	Your promises were nothin' but lies

I can't explain the way I feel about this love
You left me all alone
Boy where did we go wrong?
'cause all the promises that you made
Were words just spoken
How could you leave me standing there

Let the truth speak
Bought you a jeep and the coup, please
Beach world, crump every Sierra with two seats
For two weeks both had beef, it grew deep
Made me loose sleep 
Forced me to creep with this new piece
Outta town for a minute now
Damn near finished now, simmer down
I know you stressed and it been a while
Daydreamin' and Daytona sun stay beamin'

Your girlfriend's are jealous, that's why they tried to stop us

Then sailed to San Juan, come drink from my fountain
For all my wrongs, I beg your pardon
How could you end this when we just startin'

Just hike up your skirt and stash the weed in your cooch

I need huge boobs, on the daily in my face

Or you might have known I'd never make a wife
You walked out on the only one who ever loved you
So I went back to the wild side of life

To all the killas and the hundred dollar billas
Like to welcome you to Cleveland, this the home of Ray Scrilla
Where we all blow swishers, all chase figures
With our eye on the prize, while the law chase niggaz, get high!
Comtemplate the paper chasing but them crackas giving complications
Locking niggaz up without a combiniton, prison is not in my vision
Even though it coincide with the life and the way that I'm living
My mind designed with a divine sense of division, multiplication and addition
I'm a math-a-gician, I was taught to subtract anything trying to intervene and
To distract the type of paper that I'm trying to attract
We really don't wanna have to clap, but if it has to happen
Its happened as simple as that, chip stacking rather its coming from
Jacking the packs, I hustle, but it just so happen I rap, and I'm back and this is...

Inside of a box pacing, waiting, patient for they day of arraignment
Worried about they family and time they facing
Look don't worry about the streets, the streets ain't changing
Me I'm doing good dog, hope y'all maintaining
These hos ain't changed man, we still bang em
When theirs beef off in the street we still flaming
But don't worry about the drama, nigga worry about your mama
Write her letters, I'll fly you this kite, know your nights is hard
Know you hate it in the yard, rather be out here pushing raw
But when you get released, come holla at your dog
And we can give these fuckas...huh

I let the fact remain, leave the crack or rap game

Keep Her On the Phone Checking In Like A P.O
Speaking At My Heart Just To Be Mwe Frio
She Tryin to Warm It Up
Just To Keep Me Out The Cut
She Do Me Everyday But She Just My Freak
You Can Try To Get Her She Won?t Even Speak
She Find A Way To Keep My Guard Down Like Eve
She So Amazing

She Right Off The Page Of A Woman?s Book
She So Amazing With Every Look
Keep My Heart Racing Everytime She Come & Open My Passenger Door

Ray Cepeda,"I'm not in love
So don't forget it
It's just a silly phase I'm going through
And just because
I call you up
Don't get me wrong, don't think you've got it made
I'm not in love, no no, it's because..

I like to see you
But then again
That doesn't mean you mean that much to me
So if I call you
Don't make a fuss
Don't tell your friends about the two of us
I'm not in love, no no, it's because..

I keep your picture
Upon the wall
It hides a nasty stain that's lying there
So don't you ask me
To give it back
I know you know it doesn't mean that much to me
I'm not in love, no no, it's because..

Ooh you'll wait a long time for me
Ooh you'll wait a long time
Ooh you'll wait a long time for me
Ooh you'll wait a long time

I'm not in love
So don't forget it
It's just a silly phase I'm going through
And just because I call you up
Don't get me wrong, don't think you've got it made

Ray Cepeda,"I see the crystal raindrops fall
And the beauty of it all
Is when the sun comes shining through
To make those rainbows in my mind
When I think of you sometime
And I wanna spend some time with you

Just the two of us
We can make it if we try
Just the two of us
(Just the two of us)
Just the two of us
Building castles in the sky
Just the two of us
You and I

We look for love, no time for tears
Wasted water's all that is
And it don't make no flowers grow
Good things might come to those who wait
Not for those who wait too late
We gotta go for all we know

On the window down the hall
And it becomes the morning dew
And darling when the morning comes
And I see the morning sun
I wanna be the one with you

Ray Charles,"As I was walking down the street last night
A pretty little girl came into sight
I bowed and smiled and asked her name
She said, ""Hold it bud, I don't play that game""
I reached in my pocket, and to her big surprise
There was Lincoln staring her dead in the eyes

On a greenback, greenback dollar bill
Just a little piece of paper, coated with chlorophyll

She looked at me with that familiar desire
Her eyes lit up like they were on fire
She said, ""My name's Flo, and you're on the right track
But look here, daddy, I wear furs on my back
So if you want to have fun in this man's land
Let Lincoln and Jackson start shaking hands""

On a greenback, greenback dollar bill
Just a little piece of paper, coated with chlorophyll

I didn't know what I was getting into
But I popped Lincoln and Jackson, too
I didn't mind seeing them fade out of sight
I just knew I'd have some fun last night
Whenever you in town and looking for a thrill
If Lincoln can't get it, Jackson sure will

On a greenback, greenback dollar bill
Just a little piece of paper, coated with chlorophyll

We went to a nightspot where the lights were low
Dined and danced, and I was ready to go
I got out of my seat, and when Flo arose
She said, ""Hold on daddy, while I powder my nose""
I sat back down with a smiling face
While she went down to the powder place

With my greenback, greenback dollar bill
Just a little piece of paper, coated with chlorophyll

The music stopped and the lights came on
I looked around and saw I was all alone
I didn't know how long Flo had been gone
But a nose powder sure didn't take that long
I left the place with tears in my eyes
As I waved Lincoln and Jackson a last goodbye

On a greenback, greenback dollar bill
Just a little piece of paper, coated with chlorophyll",Green Backs,
Ray Charles,"Angel eyes angel eyes
The ways of the world are feeble
Don't give up on simple people
Angle eyes stun those nights
The blues you can live without
It's not what you song's about
Angel eyes angel eyes
Tell me what would we're doin'
Without the light from angel eyes

You can move the hearts of men
Just with a phrase you're turning
Since hearts ever have been yearning
Bear with us bear so alone
Thin lines you've been living on
Are so close to the danger zone

Tell me what would we're doin'
Without the light from angel eyes",Angel Eyes,
Ray Charles,"Now there far from me there's an old holler tree
Where you lay down a dollar or two
You go round the bend and you come back again
With a jug of that good ole mountain dew
They call it that ole mountain dew Lord Lord and them that refuse it are few
I'll hush up my mug if you'll fill up my jug with that good ole mountain dew

The preacher came by with his head high said hi said his wife took down with the flu
And he thought that we're hard just to give him a quart
Of that good old mountain dew 
Well we call it that ole mountain dew

My uncle Mort he's sawed off and he's short he measures bout four foot two
But he thinks he's a giant when you give him a pint of that good old mountain dew

Hush up my mug if you'll fill up my jug with that good ole mountain dew",Mountain Dew,

Ray Charles,"I'm feelin' mighty lonesome
Haven't slept a wink
I walk the floor an' watch the door
In between I drink
Black coffee â?¦

Love's a hand-me-down brew
I'll never know a Sunday
In this weekday room.

Been talkin' to the shadows
One o'clock 'til four
An' Lord how slow the moments go
When all ya do is pour
Black coffee â?¦

Since the blues caught my eye
I'm hangin' out on Monday
My Sunday dreams to dry.

You know a man is born to love a woman
To work and slave to pay her debts
Just because he's only human
To drown his past regrets
In coffee and cigarettes.

I'm moonin' all the mornin'
Mournin' all the night
In between it's nicotine
Not much heart to fight
Black coffee ...

Feelin' low as the ground
I'm waitin' for my baby
To maybe come around.

Gonna drown my past regrets
In some coffee and a few cigarettes.

I'm moonin' all the mornin'
Mournin' all the night
In between it's nicotine
And not much heart to fight
Black coffee â?¦

Feeling low as the ground
It's driving me crazy!
Just waitin' for my baby
To maybe come around.
Please come around
Please come â?¦



",Black Coffee,1957
Ray Charles,"Usin' the phone booth,
Makin' a few calls,
Doodlin' weird things,
Usin' the booth walls.

Got me a big date,
Waitin' for my chick,
Puttin' my face on,
So she could look slick,

I enjoy procrastinating
'Cause I'm busy while I'm waiting,
Doodlin' away, doodlin away

Sittin' and dinin' (dining)
Dinner beginnin',
Started designin'
Usin' the linen,

Talkin' to my date,
Doodlin' my bit,
Waiter got salty,
Told me to please quit
Told the waiter, ""Don't be dizzy,
""Can't you see I'm very busy,
""Doodlin' away, doodlin' away.""

""Do you doodle all day?""
Asked the waiter in his way,
""Do you doodle all night?""
Told the waiter he was right,
""In your doodlin' way-""
""That's the way I'm gonna stay,""
""Are you thinkin' things right?""
""Doodlin' sheds a lot of light,""
""Don't know what I can do,""
""Ain't nothing you can do,""
""With old doodlin' you,""
""Doodin's all I want to do,""

That's for true!

Why does every single thing I see
Look exactly like a doodle to me?
If I ever have a doubt
What life is all about
I get my pencil out and then commence to doodlin' 
And I find it real relaxing
'Specially when I feel that life is really taxing!

'Cause weird designs
They only show what's going on 
In weirder minds
Those when you doodle then your noodle's flying blind
Every little thing that you write
Just conceivably might
Be a thought that you capture
While coppin' a wink
Doodlin' takes you beyond what you see
When you write what you think.

I'd feel so lost without my doodlin',
Doodlin' really helps me ease my mind,
I'd be tempest-tossed
Without my doodlin',
When I'm doodlin' there's one thing I find,

Truly, I really really really really really truly truly wanna figure out
What my doodlin's all about.

Later the waiter
Had me arrested,
Took me to Bellevue,
Where I was tested.

Had me a doctor
Probin' my noodle,
'Fore he was half-done,
Taught him to doodle,
Showed him hidden thoughts that linger 
Find an outlet through your finger,
Doodlin' away, doodlin' away.

Doctor was real nice,
Told me to be cool,
Looked at the waiter, 
Called him the real fool, 

Looked at my baby
Told me he dug her,
Got me to doodlin',
So he could bug her,

When he put his arms around her,
Quite to his surprise he found her, 
Doodlin' away, doodlin' away

We just doodle all day!",Doodlin',1957
Ray Charles,"Pride, sad, splendid liar,  
Sworn enemy of love
Kept my lips from saying
Things I was thinking of.
But now my pride you've humbled,
I've cast it to the winds,
Broken, beaten, sick at heart
My confession begins.
 
We've played the game of stay away
But it cost more that I can pay.
Without you I can't make my way,
I surrender, dear.

I may seem proud, I may act gay,
It's just a pose, I'm not that way,
'Cause deep down in my heart I say
I surrender, dear.

Little mean things we were doing
Must have been part of the game,
Lending a spice to the wooing,
But I don't care who's to blame.
When stars appear and shadows fall,
Why then you'll hear My poor heart call,
To you my love, my life, my all
I surrender, dear.

The man I love
And he'll be big and strong
The man I love
And when he comes my way
I'll do my best to make him stay

He'll look at me and smile
I'll understand
Then in a little while
He'll take my hand
And though it seems absurd
I know we both won't say a word

Maybe I shall meet him Sunday
Maybe Monday, maybe not
Still I'm sure to meet him one day
Maybe Tuesday will be my good news day

My cryin' helped me from showin' them
That I was blue
(Listen )

By myself you
L never know what I've been through
(Just what I'm goin' through )

My lips conceal a hurtin' pain
I make believe but all in vain

I said now after
My cryin' helped me from showin' them
That I was blue

My cryin' helped me from showin' them
That I was blue

My lips conceal a hurtin' pain
I make believe but all in vain

Ray Charles,"The torch I carry is handsome, it's worth its heartache in ransom
Now when that twilight steals, I know how the lady in the harbor feels
When I want rain, I get sunny weather, I'm just as blue, blue as the sky
Since love has gone, I can't get myself together, guess I'll hang my tears out to dry
My friend ask me out, but I tell them I'm busy, I've got to get a new alibi
I hang around at home, and ask myself: ""Where is she?""
Guess I'll hang my tears out to dry
Dry little tear drops, my little tear drops, moving on a stream of dreams
My little memories, those precious memories, remind me of our crazy schemes
Then somebody says, just forget about her, but I gave that treatment a try
Strangely enough, I got along without her
Then one day she passed me right by - oh well
I guess I'll hang my tears out to dry",Guess I'll Hang My Tears Out to Dry,1964
Ray Charles,"I remember other days how I used to weep 
Over things you said to me; I couldn't even sleep
You forgot your promises, every single vow
All you did was laugh at me, but things are different now
 
I cried for you; now it's your turn to cry over me
Every road has a turning
That's one thing you're learning
I cried for you; what a fool I used to be
Now I found two eyes just a little bit bluer
I found a heart just a little bit truer
I cried for you; now it's your turn to cry over me
 
How can I forget the hours that I worried through
Wondering the live long day just what next thing to do?
In those days you never thought anything of me
But the slave that was all yours and now at last is free
 
I cried for you; now it's your turn to cry over me
Every road has a turning
That's one thing you're learning

A tear fell when I saw you
In the arms of someone new
A tear fell when you left me
All alone and feeling blue
A tear fell when you told me
That your love was not for me
I didn't miss the teardrops,
But I missed you constantly
A fool am I, a fool am I, in love

The teardrops that you stepped on
As you danced across the floor.
Were crushed like my poor heart was
When you walked out of my door.

That the flame in your heart died.

Like these teardrops from my eyes

Is the power in my hands

But they have slipped away
I've had fame
But it doesn't stay
I've made fortunes
Spent them fast enough
As for woman
They don't last with just one man
But baby grand
Will stand by me

They say that no one's gonna play this on the radio
They said the melancholy blues were dead and gone
But only songs like these
Played in minor keys
Keep those memories holding on

I've come far
From the life I've strayed in
I've got scars
From those dives I've played in
Now I'm home
And I'm weary
In my bones
Every dreary one night stand
But baby grand
Came home with me

And said ""say a prayer for me""
She threw her arms around him
Whispered, ""God will keep us free""
They could hear the riders comin'
He said, ""this is my last fight
If they take me back to Texas
They won't take me back alive""

There were seven Spanish angels
At the altar of the sun
They were prayin' for the lovers
In the valley of the gun
When the battle stopped and the smoke cleared
There was thunder from the throne
And seven Spanish angels
Took another angel home

She reached down and picked the gun up
That lay smokin' in his hand
She said, ""Father, please forgive me
I can't make it without my man""
And she knew the gun was empty
And she knew she couldn't win
But her final prayer was answered
When the rifles fired again
