Denise LaSalle,"Hello, may I speak to Barbara
Barbara, this is Shirley
You might not know who I am
But the reason I am calling you is because
I was going through my
Old man`s pockets this morning
And I just happened to find your name and number

So woman to woman
I don`t think it`s being anymore than fair 
To call you and let you know 
Where I`m coming from

Now Barbara 
I don`t know how you`re gonna take this
But whether you be cool 
Or come out of a bag on me
You see it doesn`t really make any difference

But it`s only fair that I let you know that
The man you`re in love with
He's mine

From the top of his head 
To the bottom of his feet
The bed he sleeps in 
And every piece of food he eats

You see, I make it possible 
The clothes on his back
Ha ha, I buy them
The car he drives
I pay the note every month

So I`m telling you these things
To let you know how much I love that man 
And woman to woman
I think you`ll understand
How much I`ll do to keep him

Woman to woman
If you`ve ever been in love
Then you know how I feel
And woman to woman
Now, if you were in my shoes
Wouldn`t you have done the same thing too

Oh, oh, woman to woman
Can`t you see where I`m coming from
Woman to woman
Ain`t that the same thing you would`ve done

Woman to woman
Now should I just step aside
And let her take what`s rightfully mine

Oh, oh, woman to woman
Was I right or was I wrong
I ain`t gonna let you break up my happy home

Now woman to woman
Now you see I don't want no trouble now
I hope you understand
I love that man and he`s mine

I`m talking to you
Woman to woman
You should be woman enough to understand
That man, I love that man

Woman, woman
Woman to woman, he`s mine
And I ain`t gonna give him up
My baby, I ain`t lying, now",Woman to Woman [DVD],2005
Denise Lor,"If I give my heart to you, will you handle it with care?
Will you always treat me tenderly and in every way be fair?
If I give my heart to you, will you give me all your love?
Will you swear that you'll be true to me by the light that shines above?
And will you sigh with me when I'm sad
Smile with me when I'm glad
And always be as you are with me tonight
 
Think it over and be sure
Please don't answer 'til you do
When you promise all these things to me
Then I'll give my heart to you
 
If I give my heart to you, will you handle it with care?
Will you always treat me tenderly and in every way be fair?
If I give my heart to you, will you give me all your love?
Will you swear that you'll be true to me by the light that shines above?
And will you sigh with me when I'm sad
Smile with me when I'm glad
And always be as you are with me tonight
 
Think it over and be sure
Please don't answer 'til you do
When you promise all these things to me
Then I'll give my heart to you
",If I Give My Heart to You,2006
Denise Mangiardi,"Hush now don't explain
I know you raise Cain
I'm glad you're back
Don't explain

Quiet, don't explain
You mixed with some dame
Skip that lipstick
Don't explain

You know that I love you and what love endures
All my thoughts are of you
For I'm so completely yours
Cry to hear folks chatter, and I know you cheat
But right and wrong don't matter when you're with me sleep

Hush now, don't explain
You're my joy and pain
My life's yours love
Don't explain",Don't Explain,1998
Denise Mihalik,"So often as I wait for sleep I find myself reciting
The words I've said or should have said
Like scenes that need rewriting

The smiles I never answered
Doors perhaps I should have opened
Songs forgotten in the morning

I relived the roles I've played
The tears I may have squandered
The many pipers I have paid along the roads I wandered

Yet all the time I knew it
Love was somewhere out there waiting
Though I may regret a kiss or two

If I had changed a single day
What went amiss or went astray
I may have never found my way to you",On My Way to You,2005
Denise Mihalik,"You can take the moon, gather up the stars
And the robins that sing merrily
Put 'em in a box, tie 'em with a ribbon
Throw 'em in the deep blue sea

You can take the flowers, down in lovers lane
And that sentimental poetry
Put 'em in a box, tie 'em with a ribbon
Throw 'em in the deep blue sea

Not for me, all that stuff
The dreams that ruin your sleep
Not for me, had enough
Love is one thing you can keep

You can take the plans and the wedding bells
And whoever sings, ""Oh, promise me""
Put 'em in a box, tie 'em with a ribbon
Throw 'em in the deep blue sea
'Cause love and I we don't agree

Hansoms through the park, kisses in the dark
All the promises made faithfully
Put 'em in a box, tie 'em with a ribbon
Throw 'em in the deep blue sea

And you won't go wrong if you take a song
Sung by Frankie Boy or Mr. C
Put 'em in a box, tie 'em with a ribbon
Throw 'em in the deep blue sea

Not for me, all that stuff
Not for me, had enough

You know what to do with good old tea for two
And the girl for you, the boy for me
Put 'em in a box, tie 'em with a ribbon
Throw 'em in the deep blue sea
'Cause love and I we don't agree","Put 'Em in a Box, Tie 'Em with a Ribbon",2005
Denise Montana,"The more I'm with you pretty baby
The more I feel my love increase
I'm building all my dreams around you
My happiness will never cease
But nothing's any good without you
Cause baby you're my centerpiece

I buy a house and garden somewhere
Along a country road a piece
A little cottage on the outskirts
Where we can really find release
But nothing's any good without you
Cause baby you're my centerpiece
Hey baby come and go
[Repeat first and second verse]",Centerpiece,2003
Denise Montana,"I look at you and suddenly, something in your eyes I see;
Soon begins bewitching me.
It's that old devil moon that you stole from the skies.
It's that old devil moon in your eyes.

You and you glance make this romance too hot to handle.
Stars in the night, blazing their light can't hold a candle;
To your razzle-dazzle.
You've got me flyin' high and wide, on a magic carpet ride;

Full of butterflies inside.
Want to cry, want to croon, want to laugh like a loon.
It's that old devil moon in your eyes.
Just when I think, I'm free as a dove.
Old devil moon, deep in your eyes, blinds me with love.",Old Devil Moon,2003

Denise Nejame,"Oh you get me ready in your 56 Chevy 
Why don't we go sit down in the shade 
Take shelter on my front porch 
The dandy lion sun scorching, 
Like a glass of cold lemonade 
I will do laundry if you pay all the bills 

[Chorus] 
Where is my John Wayne 
Where is my prairie song 
Where is my happy ending 
Where have all the cowboys gone 

Why don't you stay the evening 
Kick back and watch the TV 
And I'll fix a little something to eat 
Oh I know your back hurts from working on the tractor 
How do you take your coffee my sweet 
I will raise the children if you pay all the bills 

[Chorus]

I am wearing my new dress tonight 
But you don't, but you don't even notice me
Say goodbyes 
Say goodbyes 
Say goodbyes 

We finally sell the Chevy 
When we had another baby 
And you took the job in Tennessee 
You made friends at the farm 
And you joined them at the bar 
Almost every single day of the week 

[Chorus]

I will wash the dishes while you go have a beer 
Where is my Marlboro man 
Where is his shiny gun 
Where is my lonely ranger 
Where have all the cowboys gone 
Yippee yo, yippee yeah",Where Have All the Cowboys Gone,1999
Denise Nejame,"How about getting off of these antibiotics
How about stopping eating when I'm filled up
How about them transparent dangling carrots
How about that ever elusive kudo

[Chorus]
Thank you India
Thank you terror
Thank you disillusionment
Thank you frailty
Thank you consequence
Thank you thank you silence

How about me not blaming you for everything
How about me enjoying the moment for once
How about how good it feels to finally forgive you
How about grieving it all one at a time

[Chorus]

The moment I let go of it was
The moment I got more than I could handle
The moment I jumped off of it was
The moment I touched down

How about no longer being masochistic
How about remembering your divinity
How about unabashedly bawling your eyes out
How about not equating death with stopping

[Chorus]",Thank U,2000
Denise Norton,"Speak low when you speak, love,
Our summer day withers away
Too soon, too soon.

Speak low when you speak, love,
Our moment is swift, like ships adrift,
We're swept apart too soon.

Speak low, darling speak low,
Love is a spark lost in the dark,
Too soon, too soon,
I feel wherever I go
That tomorrow is near, tomorrow is here
And always too soon.

Time is so old and love so brief,
Love is pure gold and time a thief.
We're late darling, we're late,
The curtain descends, ev'rything ends
Too soon, too soon,
I wait darling, I wait
Will you speak low to me,
Speak love to me and soon.",Speak Low,2000
Denise Perrier,"It seems we stood and talked like this before
We looked at each other in the same way then
But I can't remember where or when

The clothes you're wearing are the clothes you wore
The smile you are smiling you were smiling then
But I can't remember where or when

Some things that happened for the first time
Seem to be happening again

And so it seems that we have met before
And laughed before, and loved before
But who knows where or when",Where or When,1997
Denise Perrier,"She's a fool and don't I know it
But a fool can have her charms
I'm in love and don't I show it
Like a babe in arms

Love's the same old situation
Lately I've not slept a wink
Since this crazy situation
Has me on the blink

I'm wild again, beguiled again
A whimpering, simpering child again
Bewitched, bothered and bewildered, am I

Couldn't sleep, wouldn't sleep
Love came and told me, shouldn't sleep
Bewitched, bothered and bewildered, am I

I lost my heart, but what of it
She is cold I agree
She might laugh, but I love it
Although the laugh's on me

I'll sing to her, bring spring to her
And long, for the day when I'll cling to her
Bewitched, bothered and bewildered, am I","Bewitched, Bothered and Bewildered",2002
Denise Perrier,"Day after day
Alone on a hill
The man with the foolish grin
Is keeping perfectly still
But nobody wants to know him
They can see that he's just a fool
And he never gives an answer

But the fool on the hill
Sees the sun going down
And the eyes in his head
See the world spinning round

Well on the way
Head in a cloud
The man of a thousand voices
Talking perfectly loud

But nobody ever hears him
Or the sounds he appears to make
And he never seems to notice

But the fool on the hill
Sees the sun going down
And the eyes in his head
See the world spinning round

And nobody seems to like him
They can tell what he wants to do
And he never shows his feelings

But the fool on the hill
Sees the sun going down
And the eyes in his head
See the world spinning round

He never listens to them
He knows that they're the fools
They don't like him

Sees the sun going down
And the eyes in his head
See the world spinning round

Denise Perrier,"I let a song go out of my heart
It was the sweetest melody
I know I lost heaven 'cause you were the song

Since you and I have drifted apart
Life doesn't mean a thing to me
Please come back, sweet music, I know I was wrong

Am I too late to make amends?
You know that we were meant to be more than just friends, just friends

I let a song go out of my heart
Believe me, darlin', when I say
I won't know sweet music until you return some day

Denise Perrier,"A country dance was being held in a garden
I felt a bump and heard an ""Oh, beg your pardon""
Suddenly I saw polka dots and moonbeams
All around a pug-nosed dream

The music started and was I the perplexed one
I held my breath and said ""May I have the next one?""
In my frightened arms, polka dots and moonbeams
Sparkled on a pug-nosed dream

There were questions in the eyes of other dancers
As we floated over the floor
There were questions but my heart knew all the answers
And perhaps a few things more

Now in a cottage built of lilacs and laughter
I know the meaning of the words ""Ever after""
And I'll always see polka dots and moonbeams
When I kiss the pug-nosed dream",Polka Dots and Moonbeams,2004
Denise Perrier,"Maybe I should have saved those left over dreams
Funny, but here's that rainy day
Here's that rainy day they told me about
And I laughed at the thought that it might turn out this way

Where is that worn out wish that I threw aside
After it brought my lover near
It's funny how love becomes a cold rainy day
Funny, that rainy day is here

Funny how love becomes a cold rainy day
Funny, that rainy day is here",Here's That Rainy Day,2009
Denise Perrier,"Love is lovelier the second time around
Just as wonderful with both feet on the ground
It's that second time you hear your love song sung
Makes you think perhaps that love, like youth, is wasted on the young
Love's more comfortable the second time you fall
Like a friendly home the second time you call
Who can say what brought us to this miracle we've found?
There are those who'll bet  love comes but once, and yet
I'm oh, so glad we met the second time around

Denise Perrier,"You'd be so nice to come home to
You'd be so nice by the fire
While the breeze on high, sang a lullaby

Under an August moon shining above
You'd be so nice, you'd be paradise

All aglow again, takin' a chance on love.
Here I slide again, about to take that ride again.
Starry-eyed again, takin' a chance on love.

I thought that cards were a frame-up, I never would try.
Now I'm taking that game up and the ace of hearts is high.
Things are mending now, I see a rainbow blending now.
We'll have a happy ending now, takin' a chance on love.

Here I slip again, about to take that trip again.
I got that grip again, takin' a chance on love.
Now I prove again that I can make life move again.
Um - I'm in the groove again, takin' a chance on love.

I walk around with a horse shoe, in clover I lie.

The moon may be high

Together we're going a long, long way

They're only made of clay

Es porque yo quiero siempre transformar

Gira por mi cabeza y cuando tropieza me hace mal
Ese razonamiento de nuestro cuerpo al respirar
Que como una serpiente, borre tu mente y te hace olvidar
Que tú vales más, que todo eso que pueden mirar

Todo mal pensamiento, que con el tiempo así se va
Y como un leopardo yo me aguardo, no quiero amenazar

It's not easy, it's not easy when you have to be apart.

My niggas only worried bout the jewelry and the street fame
And what the bitches thought of them, it's all about the money
Well shit I cop some Porsche or trucks

Hoopty motherfucka', hoppin the double four's
My pants droopy motherfuckas
And pardon my grammar, my nana died '95
So I done left my heart wit my grandma
I hid outside and played the park wit the hammer

I heard Po put the order on him, now that's more than a friend!
But he stitched of course, now let's talk about Fritz the boss
And he got rich off snort, they said 500 bricks was brought
So in hindsight, it's a shorty who couldn't get a gist of his thought
But if you grind right wit the snorpy, a whip could be bought
Now think about po-9, if it caught me, how it get you in court
But now the feds, they still tailin' me, DA think he nailin' me
I had to turn in the goons come and post the bail for me

Upon a ridge he rested as he went along his way,
When all at once a mighty herd of red-eyed cows he saw,
A ploughin' through the ragged skies
And up a cloudy draw.
Yippee-yi-ay, yippee-yi-o,
The ghost herd in the sky.

Their brands were still on fire and their hooves was made of steel,
Their horns wuz black and shiny and their hot breath he could feel,
A bolt of fear went through him as they thundered through the sky,
For he saw the riders comin' hard
And he heard their mournful cry.
Yippee-yi-ay, yippee-yi-o,
Ghost riders in the sky.

Their faces gaunt their eyes were blurred and shirts all soaked
With sweat,
They're ridin' hard to catch that herd but they ain't caught them yet
'Cause they've got to ride forever on that range up in the sky,
On horses snortin' fire
As they ride on, hear their cry.
Yippee-yi-ay, yippee-yi-o,
Ghost riders in the sky.

As the riders loped on by him he heard one call his name,
""If you want to save your soul from hell a-riding on our range,
Then cowboy change your ways today or with us you will ride
A-try'ng to catch the devil's herd
Across these endless skies.""

Had myself a ball in a small town
Married an L.A. doll and brought her to this small town
Now she's small town just like me

No I cannot forget where it is that I come from
I cannot forget the people who love me
Yeah, I can be myself here in this small town
And people let me be just what I want to be

Got nothing against a big town
Still hayseed enough to say
Look who's in the big town
But my bed is in a small town
Oh, and that's good enough for me

Well I was born in a small town
And I can breathe in a small town
Gonna die in this small town
And that's probably where they'll bury me",Small Town,2000

you look into my eyes and lie those pretty lies

Just leave it up to you and in a little while

I my baby early one morning
She was walking on down the street

It made my poor heart skip a beat

Burned the place to the ground

Smoke on the water, fire in the sky
Smoke on the water,

They burned down the gambling house
It died with an awful sound
and funky Claude was running in and out
Pulling kids out the ground

We had to find another place
But Swiss time was running out
It seemed that we would lose the race

Smoke on the water, fire in the sky
Smoke on the water,

We ended up at the Grand Hotel
It was empty cold and bare
But with the Rolling truck Stones thing just outside
Making our music there
With a few red lights and a few old beds
We made a place to sweat
No matter what we get out of this
I know we'll never forget

Somethin' inside has died, and I can't hide,
And I just can't fake it, oh, no, no.

You were light and breezy, an' I knew just what to do.

Seem to follow me wherever I go

And I always have to say no
Tell me why is it so

That I never can say goodbye, no, no, no, no, now

And start heading for the door

There's a land that I've heard of once in a lullaby.
Somewhere over the rainbow, skies are blue
And the dreams that you dare to dream,
Really do come true.

Someday I'll wish upon a star
And wake up where the clouds are far behind me.
Where troubles melt like lemon drops,
High above the chimney tops,
That's where you'll find me.

Somewhere over the rainbow, blue birds fly
Birds fly over the rainbow
Why then, oh why can't I?
If happy little bluebirds fly beyond the rainbow

Let it go and unleash the fury of my old school flow.
I'm no superstar more like a John Doe.
But I'm badder then the water down in Mexico.
Oh no, a rock n' roller man who's not allowed to be rap.
But I write what I like and I like the boom bap.
The rhyme's in the front and the beat's in the back
A trunk full of funk and a page full of fact.

Right about now I'd like to hear everyone say.
Yes o yes we shall overcome.
My fans got a job,
Are we gonna get it done?
Yes o yes we shall overcome.

I can't be shy I've gotta come with it.
No fear here! I Sing and bring it.
In Christ you've got no right livin' timid.
He's light in the dark and hope for the wicked.
There's a land of the dead called planet earth
And a race called man walks dead from birth
And the beast and man both bear the curse.
Come from the womb but retrun to dirt.

Right about now I'd like to hear everyone say.
Yes o yes we shall overcome.
My fans got a job, are we gonna get it done?
Yes o yes we shall over come.

Here's what I do I hope I get through.
So cling to what's true and tell the world too.
Cause some live in fear, oppression from peers.
These kids smoke weed, these kids that drink beers
Who don't want to hear what you got to say
And they shut their ears and laugh cause you pray,
But don't be afraid, that used to be me I used to mock God
But I was empty.

Too digital for y'all common street criminals

Or when the valley's hushed and white with snow,
It's I'll be here in sunshine or in shadow,
Oh, Danny boy, oh Danny boy, I love you so!

But when ye come, and all the flowers are dying,
If I am dead, as dead I well may be,
You'll come and find the place where I am lying,
And kneel and say an Ave there for me.

And all my grave will warmer, sweeter be,

And I shall sleep in peace until you come to me!",Danny Boy,1989

Told the tale to me

Sure, a little bit of heaven fell
From out the sky one day
And it nestled on the ocean
In a spot so far away

And when the angels found it
Sure, it looked so sweet and fair
They said, ""Suppose we leave it
For it looks so peaceful there""

So they sprinkled it with stardust
Just to make the shamrocks grow
'Tis the only place you'll find them

But they won't come off with water
Hoping truth will make me clean and then
Redeem my sons and daughters
Though they're not we're very happy
Vast along the nose

Seems so simple, the future's the past
The present are the things we holdin' on to make those last

And I am a fool for beauty
Fooled by a feeling that because I have found you
I could have bound you too

You are too beautiful for one man alone
For one lucky fool to be with
When there are other men
With eyes of their own to see with

Love does not stand sharing
Not if one cares
Have you been comparing
My every kiss with theirs

If, on the other hand, I'm faithful to you
It's not through a sense of duty
You are too beautiful
And I am a fool for beauty

From glen to glen, and down the mountain side.

It's you, it's you must go and I must bide.

Or when the valley's hushed and white with snow,
It's I'll be here in sunshine or in shadow,
Oh, Danny boy, oh Danny boy, I love you so!

But when ye come, and all the flowers are dying,
If I am dead, as dead I well may be,
You'll come and find the place where I am lying,
And kneel and say an Ave there for me.

And all my grave will warmer, sweeter be,
For you will bend and tell me that you love me,
And I shall sleep in peace until you come to me!",Danny Boy,2006

As she gazed around the room
Even now she wondered what went wrong
A letter in her hand trembled
As she placed it by the phone
All at once there were footsteps by the door
She didn't want a confrontation
To tear them apart
She wasn't sure of all the feelings
Racing through her heart

I looked into her eyes
Knowing something wasn't right
And suddenly the tears began to show
Babe, I know that it's wrong
But you know I'm really not that strong
How I wish I could tell you that I am
But before I even read this letter
I want you to stay,

There's one thing I've got to say, whoa

Believe me when I say to you
Anytime will be alright

8 to 5 in the welding shop
Barely finished junior high

Who'd give his friends the shirt right off his back

Or stock reports in the daily news

Like taxes, death and union strikes

So he went and looked for work in every factory
But they were all now servicing in this new economy

On the ships from foreign shores
Smaller cars and VCR's were here to stay

Laughter fills the air
And everyone is singing
I hear those sleigh bells ringing
Santa won't you bring me the one I really need
Won't you please bring my baby to me

Oh I don't want a lot for Christmas
This is all I'm asking for
I just want to see my baby
Standing right outside my door
Oh I just want him for my own
More than you could ever know
Make my wish come true
Baby all I want for Christmas is you
All I want for Christmas is you baby
All I want for Christmas is you baby",All I Wanted,2004
Dennis Dinde,"We were all down at Margie's bar
Telling stories if we had one
Someone fired the old jukebox up
The song sure was a sad one
A teardrop rolled down Bubba's nose
From the pain the song was inflicting
And all at once he jumped to his feet
Just like somebody kicked him

Bubba shot the juke box last night
Said it played a sad song it made him cry
Went to his truck and got a forty five
Bubba shot the juke box last night

Bubba ain't never been accused of being mentality stable
So we did not draw an easy breathe
Until he laid that colt on the table
He hung his head till the cops showed up
They dragged him right out of Margie's
Told him ""Don't play dumb with us, son""
""Know damn well what the charge is.""

Bubba shot the juke box last night
Said it played a sad song it made him cry
Went to his truck and got a forty five
Bubba shot the juke box last night

Well, the sheriff arrived with his bathrobe on
The confrontation was a tense one
Shook his head said, ""Bubba Boy,""
""You was always a dense one.""
Reckless discharge of a gun
That's what the officers are claiming
Bubba hollered, ""Reckless! Hell!""
""I shot just where I was aiming.""

Bubba shot the juke box last night
Said it played a sad song it made him cry
Went to his truck and got a forty five
Bubba shot the juke box  stopped it with one shot
Bubba shot the jukebox last night
Well he could not tell right from wrong
Through the teardrops in his eyes
Beyond a shadow of a doubt
It was justifiable homicide
Bubba shot the juke box stopped it with one shot
Bubba shot the jukebox last night",Bubba Shot the Jukebox,1995

There wasn't a way down on Earth here to cool them

Using pots and pans as their shields and their helmets

You see, I was born and raised in the slums of the city,
It was a one room shack that slept ten other children besides me.
We hardly had enough food or room to sleep.
It was hard times,
Needed something to ease my troubled mind.
Listen!  my father didn't know the meaning of work,
He disrespected mama, and treated us like dirt.
I left home, seekin' a job that I never did find,
Depressed and downhearted I took to cloud nine,
I'm doin' fine, up here on cloud nine.
Listen one more time I'm doin' fine, up here on cloud nine.
Folks down there tell me,
They say, ""give yourself a chance son, don't let life pass you by"".
But the world of reality is a rat race where only the strongest survive,
It's a dog eat dog world, and that ain't no lie.
Listen!  it ain't even safe no more to walk the streets at night,

And I'm gonna live the life I love up here on cloud nine.

With her went my future my life is filled with gloom
So day after day I stay locked up in my room.

'Cause so badly I wanna go outside
But everyone knows that a man ain't supposed to cry
Listen, I gotta cry 'cause crying eases the pain,
Oh yeah, people this hurt I feel inside.
Words could never explain, I just wish it would rain.

Day in day out my tear-stained face
Pressed against the window pain,
My eyes search the skies desperately for rain,
Cause rain-drops will hide my tear -drops
And no one will ever know that I'm crying,
Crying when I go outside.
To the world outside my tears,
I refuse to explain, oh I wish it would rain,
Let it rain, let it rain.

Dennis Edwards,"Loser, loser

[Chorus]
It's so hard being a loser
Always trying to find a way
To overcome this heartache inside
And find happiness someday

Listen to me
Look upon this empty face
And you'll see a lonely man
So all alone, so far from home

Reaching out for happiness
Only finding emptiness
Someone please
Won't you help me

[Chorus]

I walk in silent solitude
Shattered dream never came true
Many night I cried, unsatisfied

A dark cloud's hanging over me
My life leads to nowhere
No peaceful times
I've known were mine

It's so hard, yes, it is, being a loser
Always trying to find a way
(I know it's so hard)
To overcome this heartache inside
And find happiness someday

I don't wanna be a loser, oh, no

Need a touch of tenderness
Lead me out of this wilderness
Please help me find
Some peace of mind

Endlessly, I wander on
Looking for hope to build a?
Oh, someone see, I'm so alone

It's a cold man to hurt his woman
And watch her walk away crying
When all along, he knows he's wrong
Being so hard on a woman who's trying

I was so unkind to hurt you so
Going out of my mind
I just gotta let you know that

Baby, I just can't let you go
I realize I hurt you so
Our love, surely can we mend it
It's just a little misunderstanding

I remember you said
You would always care
Until death should we do part
Baby, surely must be our destiny
To die the death of a broken heart

So before I go, a wandering rover
Let's get together
Talk this thing over now

Baby, I just can't let you go
I realize I hurt you so

Dennis Edwards,"As I walk this land with broken dreams
I have visions of many things.
Love's happiness is just an illusion filled with sadness and confusion.
What becomes of the brokenhearted who had love that's now departed?
I know I've got to find some kind of peace of mind.
 
Maybe, the fruits of love grow all around 
but for me they come a tumblin' down.
Ev'ry day heartaches grow a little stronger;
I can't stand this pain much longer.
I walk in shadows, searching for light,
cold and alone, no comfort in sight.
Hoping and prayin' for 
Someone to care, always movin' and goin' nowhere.
 
What becomes of the brokenhearted who had love that's now departed?
I know I've got to find some kind of peace of mind.
Maybe, I'm searching though I don't succeed,
but someone look, there's a growing need.
Oh, he is lost, there's no place for beginning;
all that's left is an unhappy ending.
 
What becomes of the brokenhearted who had love that's now departed?
I know I've got to find some kind of peace of mind.
I'll be searching ev'rywhere just find someone to care.
I'll be looking ev'ry day;
I know I'm gonna find a way.
Nothing's gonna stop me now;
I'll find a way some how.
I'll be searching ev'rywhere just find someone to care.

I've touched the sky
I've touched the sky, sky, sky, sky
I've touched the sky

I fell deeper and deeper
Through that open well that is your name
Losing count of all the drownings
Do you even understand the pain

You know this makes me feel
Like I've been so wrong
How could I believe
That I'd be singing this song

I know that things are what they tend to be
As time brings out that all seeing eye
Now I've lived and I've learned
To hate what you loved
You had me touch the sky

I've touched the sky because of you

Though the sun melts my wings
I've touched the sky because of you
It's changed my view of things
I've touched the sky because of you

Dennis Ferrer,"Church Lady, can you spare her a song,
Cos Glory Halleluiah, ain’t enough for her wrongs ,
Church Lady, can she borrow some time,
Cos she needs to sit down and reflect on her behind.
She can’t see the forest for the trees,
She got a child who’s only three,
And no child is deserving
Of an open door policy

Church Lady, can you talk her some sense,
She may be a friend of mine,
But her values are worth two cents.
I’ve tried my point of view,
All of her friends have tried it too,
So Church Lady, sing her that song, sing her that song.

Church Lady, can you save her a prayer,
She ain’t been home since last night,
And she’s got us runnin scared.
Church Lady, do you have this emergency light
(Yes I do)
She needs to be safe from herself,
She’s got her own way to find.
She can’t see the forest for the trees,
She got a child who’s only three,
She’s got her head in the clouds,
Holding on to some fantasy.

Church Lady, you better find her a hymn,
She’s going down that road,
She’ll be early seeing Him.
I’ve tried my point of view,
All of her friends tried it too,
So Church Lady, sing her that song, sing her that song.

It brings back the sound of music so tender
It brings back a night of tropical splendor
It brings back a memory ever green

I'm with you once more under the stars
And down by the shore an orchestra's playing
And even the palms seem to be swaying
When they begin the beguine

To live it again is past all endeavor
Except when that tune clutches my heart
And there we are, swearing to love forever
And promising never, never to part

What moments divine, what rapture serene
Till clouds came along to disperse the joys we had tasted
And now when I hear people curse the chance that was wasted
I know but too well what they mean

So don't let them begin the beguine
Let the love that was once a fire remain an ember
Let it sleep like the dead desire I only remember
When they begin the beguine

Oh yes, let them begin the beguine, please make them play
Till the stars that were there before return above you
Till you whisper to me once more, ""Darling, I love you""

Mississippi, you'll be on my mind
Everytime I hear this song
Mississippi roll along
Until the end of time

Now the country song for ever lost its soul
When the guitar player turned to rock & roll
And everytime when the summernights are falling
I will always be calling dreams of yesterday",Mississippi,2007
Dennis Kamakahi,"When they begin the beguine
It brings back the sound of music so tender
It brings back a night of tropical splendor
It brings back a memory ever green

I'm with you once more under the stars
And down by the shore an orchestra's playing
And even the palms seem to be swaying
When they begin the beguine

To live it again is past all endeavor
Except when that tune clutches my heart
And there we are, swearing to love forever
And promising never, never to part

What moments divine, what rapture serene
Till clouds came along to disperse the joys we had tasted
And now when I hear people curse the chance that was wasted
I know but too well what they mean

So don't let them begin the beguine
Let the love that was once a fire remain an ember
Let it sleep like the dead desire I only remember
When they begin the beguine

Oh yes, let them begin the beguine, please make them play
Till the stars that were there before return above you
Till you whisper to me once more, ""Darling, I love you""
Then we suddenly know what heaven we're in
When they begin the, begin the, begin the beguine

When they begin the, begin the, begin the beguine
When they begin the beguine",Begin the Beguine,2004

When you're in love with a beautiful woman, it's hard;
When you're in love with a beautiful woman, you know it's hard;
Everybody wants her, everybody loves her; 
Everybody wants to take your baby home;
 
When you're in love with a beautiful woman, you watch your friends;
When you're in love with a beautiful woman, it never ends;
You, know that it's crazy and you wanna trust her; 
Then somebody hangs up when you answer the phone;
 
When you're in love with a beautiful woman, you go it alone.
Maybe it's just an ego problem; 
Problem is that I've been fooled before;
by fairweather friends and faint hearted lovers;
And every time it happens, it just convinces me more; 
 
When you're in love with a beautiful woman, you watch her eyes;
When you're in love with a beautiful woman, you look for lies; 
'Cause everybody tempts her, 
everybody tells her she's the most beautiful woman they know; 
 
When you're in love with a beautiful woman, you go it alone.
When you're in love with a beautiful woman, you watch your friends;
When you're in love with a beautiful woman, it never ends;

I gently kiss her lips, touch her with my finger tips
Searching for the love I miss, you once gave to me
She is warm here by my side, I should be satisfied
It's sad to realise I'm still in love with you

'Cause I'm chained to your memory
Tied and bound, I can't get free
There's got to be another love for me
There's got to be someone to set me free

She holds me close to her, I love the sweet things she whispers
But only my memory stirs, my heart still isn't free

'Cause I'm chained to your memory
Tied and bound, I can't get free
There's got to be another love for me
There's got to be someone to set me free

Let's talk about hearts, no two are the same
Some of them are cold as ice, others need the flame
One of them gets comfortable, the other needs a change

But hearts like yours and mine, hearts like yours and mine
Hearts like yours and mine, take pleasure in the pain

Some hearts break too easily, some are hard as stone
One heart cries for company, the other cries alone
Other loves can walk away, but still our hearts remain

'Cause hearts like yours and mine, hearts like yours and mine
Hearts like yours and mine, take pleasure in the pain

There's pleasure in the pain, sunlight through the rain, daylight through the dark
And 'though we know the hurt, we know how much it's worth to stay here where we are

Other loves can walk away, but still our hearts remain

'Cause hearts like yours and mine, hearts like yours and mine
Hearts like yours and mine, take pleasure in the pain

There's pleasure in the pain, sunlight through the rain, daylight through the dark
And 'though we know the hurt, we know how much it's worth to stay here where we are

Dennis Mackrel,"I hear music when I look at you,
A beautiful theme of every
Dream I ever knew.
Down deep in my heart I hear it play.
I feel it start, then melt away.

I hear music when I touch your hand,
A beautiful melody
From some enchanted land.
Down deep in my heart, I hear it say,
Is this the day?

I alone have heard this lovely strain,
I alone have heard this glad refrain:
Must it be forever inside of me,
Why can't I let it go,
Why can't I let you know,
Why can't I let you know the song
My heart would sing?

That beautiful rhapsody
Of love and youth and spring,
The music is sweet,
The words are true 
The song is you.",The Song Is You,1997

With nothing to do
But to live in dreams that I make up
All by myself

Dreaming that you're beside me
I picture the prettiest stories
Only to wake up
All by myself

What is the good of me by myself?

Why was I born
Why am I living
What do I get
What am I giving

Why do I want a thing
I daren't hope for

I wish I knew

Why do I try
To draw you near me
Why do I do I cry
You never hear me

The autumn leaves of red and gold
I see your lips, the summer kisses
The sun-burned hands I used to hold

And soon I'll hear old winter's song
But I miss you most of all my darling
When autumn leaves start to fall

Love brings such misery and pain
I guess I'll never be the same

White as sheets

Like leaves

Crisp as paper
I remember trees

Ruddy faces
Muddy shoes
And light and noise and

And days

Man this hoe you can have her, when I'm done I ain't gon keep her
Man, bitches come and go, every nigga pimpin know
You saying it's secret, but you ain't gotta keep it on the low
Bitch choose with me, I'll have you stripping in the street
Put my other hoes down, you get your ass beat
Now Nik my bottom bitch, she always come up with my bread
The last nigga she was with put stitches in her head
Get your hoe out of pocket, I'll put a charge on a bitch
Cause I need 4 TVs and AMGs for the six

If I am dead, as dead I well may be,
You'll come and find the place where I am lying,

As heaven would miss the stars above
With every heartbeat I still think of you

As I watch the mating of a dove,
And it was in the springtime that we said goodbye.
I remember our faded love.

Wishing that it hadn't meant goodbye

Now I know why some people cry

I'll live my life in dreams and long for your love
It's you I'm wishing for and you I'm thinking of

My heart echoes the love words you've spoken
How I wish that I could hear them from you
Won't you answer a heart that's broken
And make my wishful thinking come true

He sells each one for ten dollars,
Like some medicine man 
Seems to know a lot for a kid just sixteen years old

He's got trademark shoes, three tattoos
A brass chord necklace and a smoke-stack too He's got

There's a black wind spinning the cities weather vanes 
And the eye of the storm is a crystal of cocaine

Can't you see the driving rain
Take a break from the storm in the eye of the hurricane

For something and in the morning

And in the valley the 
Sparrows sing of comfort
But my heart is weakened
Still I am willing but my
Flesh is weak I come back
To the throne but when I fall down he
Comforts me and he picks me up and
When I look back and all I see is one
Set of footprints he carried me in the

Voice that speaks into thunder but soft
Enough for creation to hold a part of me",Steppin',2001

We're together in dreams, in dreams

But just before the dawn
