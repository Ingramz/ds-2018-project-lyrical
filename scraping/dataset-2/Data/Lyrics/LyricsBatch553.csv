Kim Hill,"It's so amazing when a show is captivatin'
Gettin' everybody jumpin' and celebratin'
Only one's own musically be overlayin'
Connecting energy circulatin' inspiration
Together movin' in a synchronized formation
And if you're feelin' down this is survival from depression
You see the lesson is we're rhyming for our mission
Abolish circumstance transmitting from a piston
Taking what I can but keeping peace in moderation
A.P. is like an eagle with the alligator patience
Ready to attack any mic that I am facin'
No limitation where I'm takin' my creation cause

You're hot, hot, hot (ooh wee)
Hot, hot, hot (c'mon now)

I'm more than ready to slice like machete
Leave ya like confetti
Break hearts like Tom Petty
Are you ready?
'cause I am every metaphor
You are nearly ready for
The media predator
'cause I'll bust in your session and kick my own raps, yes
Grab the microphone and show you where the forms at
Tell your girl adapts 'cause the rhyme contact
And she easily attracted to it just like that
It's like this cause the way we captivatin'
We put her in a situation where she debatin'
If she gonna up and jump and leave her mate and

Boy don't fret everything's aight
We gonna fall on up when Luis in flight
Yo, fuck the rhyme tryin' we on poetic control
Nevermind the behind and step ahead of your soul
And move on to the next with the words we bless
'cause Black Eyed Peas is comin' hotter than sex
We're writin', rhymin', makin' the beats
Okay, hip hop blazers bringin' the heat
Motivate cut, cut and scratch the groove
Elevate then make them powerful moves

Kim Hill,"Well the sun is surely sinking down
But the moon is slowly rising
And this old world must still be spinning 'round
And I still love you

So close your eyes
You can close your eyes, it's all right
I don't know no love songs
And I can't sing the blues anymore
But I can sing this song
And you can sing this song
When I'm gone

Well it won't be long before another day
We're gonna have a good time
And no one's gonna take that time away
You can stay as long as you like

So close your eyes
You can close your eyes, it's all right
I don't know no love songs
And I can't sing the blues anymore
But I can sing this song
And you can sing this song
When I'm gone

Kim Hill,"I see you walking around like
You've lost your way
When I ask you how you feel
You don't want to say
Don't you know I love you
Don't you know how it hurts
To see you with your head so low
Like you don't know
What you're worth

There's only one sun
There's only one sky
There's only one Source
Of strength for my life
In all of the world
I know this is true
There's millions of souls
But only one you

When you look in the mirror
What is it you see
Wish you could see how beautiful
You are to me
Cause there's a treasure
Deep inside your soul
It's something no one else can give
Don't be afraid
To let it show

There's only one sun
There's only one sky
There's only one Source
Of strength for my life
In all of the world
I know this is true
There's millions of souls
But only one you

There's only one sun
There's only one sky
There's only one Source
Of strength for my life

There's millions of souls
But only one you",Only One You,1997
Kim Hill,"I hear his voice and I'm convicted
To rise above the status quo
He's asking me to live and listen
And to let His will move my soul

His Holy spirit beckons
I can't help but answer

I am committed to the call
I vow to walk in blind faith
Willing to sacrifice it all
To reflect amazing grace
I am committed to the call

I will revel in the Son's light
And let His love come shining through
I will seek life from the true vine
And bear the fruit of Holy truth

I'm drawn by words of wisdom
Whispering my name

",Committed to the Call,1998
Kim Hill,"Through every passing pleasure
Every human pain
This world holds little treasure
Still one thing remains

When all the dust has settled
And all the gold is rust
I lean into eternity
And there I place my trust

From the depths of my heart
Hear the cry of my soul
I lay down all I am, I abandon control
For You, oh God, are my God
And I desire nothing more
Nothing more than to call You Lord

You are the rhyme and reason
Within and without
Faithful in every season
Faithful in my doubt

I cannot live without You
My water, bread and light
Oh, make me Thine forever, Lord
For You alone are life

From the depths of my heart
Hear the cry of my soul
I lay down all I am, I abandon control
For You, oh God, You are my God
And I desire nothing more
Nothing more than to call You Lord

Oh, from the depths of my heart
Hear the cry of my soul
I lay down all I am, I, I abandon control
For You, oh God, are my God
And I desire nothing more, nothing more

Oh, from the depths of my heart
Hear the cry of my soul
I lay down all that I am, I abandon control
For You, oh God, You are my God
And I desire nothing more, nothing more

I'll worship You, I'll worship You
I'll call You Lord, I'll give You everything
I'll call You Lord",To Call You Lord,1998
Kim Hill,"I call you when I need you, my heart's on fire
You come to me, come to me wild and wired
Oh, you come to me, give me everything I need

Give me a life time of promises and a world of dreams
Speak the language of love like you know what it means
Mm, and it can't be wrong, take my heart and make it strong, babe
You're simply the best, better than all the rest
Better than anyone, anyone I ever met
I'm stuck on your heart, I hang on every word you say
Tear us apart, baby, I would rather be dead

In your heart I see the start of every night and every day
In your eyes I get lost, I get washed away
Just as long here in your arms I could be in no better place
You're simply the best, better than all the rest
Better than anyone, anyone I ever met
I'm stuck on your heart, I hang on every word you say
Tear us apart, baby, I would rather be dead

Each time you leave me I start losing control
You're walking away with my heart and my soul
I can feel you even when I'm alone
Oh, baby, don't let go
You're the best, better than all the rest
Better than anyone, anyone I ever met
I'm stuck on your heart
I hang on every word you say
Tear us apart
Baby I would rather be dead
Oh you're the best",Up to the Moon,1998
Kim Hill,"Oh God, You are my God 
And I will ever praise You 
Oh God, You are my God

And I will follow You all of my days

 The praises of Your people

But I bow my head and sing
Oh I bow my head and sing
I don't understand Your mercy
I'm still amazed by Your grace
I'm surrounded by forgiveness and love
How I long to see Your face
I have found a place of freedom
In Your arms of love
In the refuge of Your gentle hand
I'm aware of all these walls that keep me far from You
But know that You embrace who I am

Kim Jong-Wan of Nell,"난 오늘도 아무렇지 않게 얘길 하죠
여자친군 없다고 말하며 몰래 전화길 끄고
이 밤은 너에게 위로를 받고 싶어 더 이상은 묻지 말아줘
그녀에겐 절대로 들리지 않게 비밀로 하고

Yeah 널 처음 본 순간 no more 아무것도 보이지 않았고
내 여자도 오늘만은 없다 가정하고
무엇이 날 또 홀린 거야 이럼 안돼 알아 외도인 거야
Enjoy인 거야, 무슨 소리인 거야 그냥 그렇게만 보인거야

So today, I don’t care, 'cause we wild we rolling stones.
Today 난 바람처럼 자유롭게 I’m rockin’ my life away

난 오늘도 외롭다며 이내 맘을 주죠
혼자 있는게 싫다 괜한 여운을 남겨 기대고
사랑하는 사람과 헤어지고 새로운 만남은 너라고
나를 기다리고 있는 내 그녀는 잠이 들고 있을까요

바깥 새벽 하늘은 캄캄해 여기서 잠깐 쉬고 가자 한 밤의
울려라 라파파팜팜 너무 깊게 빠져서 헤어나올 수 없어도
내일이면 돌아갈 거야 그녀에게

So today, I don’t care, 'cause we wild we rolling stones.
Today 난 바람처럼 자유롭게 I’m rockin’ my life away

Yeah, hey baby, I got something to tell you, you know
내가 봐도 해도 내가 너무했지
첨엔 뭐 순했지 나중엔 즐겼어 죽였어 but 허무했지
그녀는 억울해했지 사실 알고 나니 싸늘했지
그것도 아주 많이 변명만 늘어놔 어눌했지
내 말투가 난 머뭇댔지 솔직히 말해 그걸 어떻게 말해?
너 하나론 부족해 뭐 이렇게 말해?
내 맘 속 가득한 사랑방 today, 손님은 for free

So today, I don’t care, 'cause we wild we rolling stones
Today 난 바람처럼 자유롭게 I’m rockin’ my life away
So today, I don’t care, 'cause we wild we rolling stones

Kim Karath,"There´s a sad sort of clanging from the clock in the hall
And the bells in the steeple too
And up in the nursery an absurd little bird
Is popping out to say ""cuckoo""

Cuckoo, cuckoo

Regretfully they tell us Cuckoo, cuckoo
But firmly they compel us Cuckoo, cuckoo
To say goodbye

Cuckoo!

To you

So long, farewell, auf Wiedersehen, good night
I hate to go and leave this pretty sight

So long, farewell, auf Wiedersehen, adieu
Adieu, adieu, to yieu and yieu and yieu

So long, farewell, au revoir, auf wiedersehen
I´d like to stay and taste my first champagne

So long, farewell, auf Wiedersehen, goodbye
I leave and heave a sigh and say goodbye
Goodbye!
I´m glad to go, I cannot tell a lie
I flit, I float, I fleetly flee, I fly
The sun has gone to bed and so must I

Kim Karath,"The hills are alive with the sound of music
With songs they have sung for a thousand years
The hills fill my heart with the sound of music
My heart wants to sing every song it hears

My heart wants to beat like the wings of the birds
that rise from the lake to the trees
My heart wants to sigh like a chime that flies
from a church on a breeze
To laugh like a brook when it trips and falls over
stones on its way
To sing through the night like a lark who is learning to pray

I go to the hills when my heart is lonely
I know I will hear what I´ve heard before
My heart will be blessed with the sound of music
And I´ll sing once more",The Sound of Music,1965

Kim Mitchell,"What do I know / I sat under a cloud / I looked up / 'fraid to look down
I knew I'd cry if I didn't clear / I knew I'd die if I didn't hear you say
Forget that fear of gravity
You take that dream away from me / I'll have trouble getting through the day

Get a little savagery in your life
I'll have trouble tying my shoes
Forget that fear of gravity
I'll laugh when it rains and dampens my hair

Get a little savagery in your life
In my cloud / I walk close never fearing the edge
Never waiting at the bend / never two-faced at a crossroads
Never wanting the edge of my cloud / tender is the night--see

Kim Mitchell,"Cats in the bag / the neighbours holler
This party is higher / than the eiffel tower

we're all here to be reckless / we're all sleazy and easy to please
Dreamers and schemers on the loose

we're all here for a celebration / the madcap scene and the max machine
And the friends you see go up in smoke
And this heel toe dance song tour de force

climbing a cloud climbing a cloud / put a little life on the line

here's Lucy she's choosey / of who calls her on the phone
She's from a very rich foreign family / but displaced cause of rivalry at home

now Daphne is the orphan / still searching for her roots
She likes concert blisters and leather boots
And knows one fact her act is to get loose

now we're just musicians / here to thin the thickness of your skin

show us your body / show us your curls / show us your tour de force
Show us your thrills / keep that smile on your face
This is the best offer you've had so far

we're innocent we're naive / in the cabarets we get our veins wet
In the saloons we hassle the richest guests
In the climb we're breathless above the rest

climbing a cloud climbing a cloud

Kim Mitchell,"Twas a hot afternoon, the last day of June
And the sun was a demon
The clouds were afraid, 110 in the shade
And the pavements were steaming

I told Billy Ray in his red Chevrolet
I needed time for some thinking
I was just walkin' by when I looked in her eye
And I swore it was winkin'

She was thirty-one and I was seventeen
I knew nothin' 'bout love, she knew everything
But I sat down beside her on a front porch swing
And wondered what the coming night would bring

The sun closed her eyes as it climbed in the sky
And it started to swelter
Sweat trickled down the front of her gown
And I thought it would melt her

She threw back her hair like I wasn't there
And she sipped on a Julep
Her shoulders were bare and I tried not to stare
When I looked at her two lips

And then she looked at me, I heard her softly say 
I know you're young, you don't know what to do or say
But stay with me until the sun has gone away
And I will chase the boy in you away

And then she smiled and we talked for a while
Then we walked for a mile to the sea
We sat on the sand and a boy took her hand 
But I saw the sunrise as a man

Ten years have gone by since I looked in her eye
But the memory lingers
I go back in my mind to the very first time
And feel the touch of her fingers",Summer (The First Time),1997

my lonely days are over, and life is like a song
At last,the skies above are blue
My heart was wrapped in clover
Every since the night I looked at you

And I found a dream that I could speak to
A dream to call my own
I found a thrill to press my cheek to
A thrill I'd never known
When you smiled, and then the spell was cast

To touch their harps of gold

To hear the Angels sing

And I hear them singing
Sing, I do hear them singing

While mortals sleep the angels keep their watch of wondering love
Oh morning stars together, proclaim thy holy birth.
And praises sing to God the king, and peace to men on earth.

No matter how fast I would run

One look is all you'd need to see the mood I'm in.
Perhaps then you'd realize I'm still in love with you.
If you could see me now, you'd find me being brave
And trying awfully hard to make my tears behave
But that's quite impossible, I'm still in love with you.
 
You'll happen my way on some mem'rable day
And the month will be May for a while.
I'll try to smile but can I play the part
Without my heart behind the smile?

The look of love is written plainly in my eyes.
I think you'd be mine again if you could see me now.",If You Could See Me Now,2004
Kim Richmond Concert Jazz Orchestra,"Love walked right in and drove the shadows away
Love walked right in and brought my sunniest day
One magic moment and my heart seemed to know that love said hello
Though not a word was spoken

One look, and I forgot the gloom of the past
One look and I had found my future at last
One look and I had found a world completely new
When love walked in with you

Come on and trade in your old dreams for new
Your new dreams for old
I know where they're bought
I know where they're sold
Midnight, you've got to get there at midnight
And you'll be met there by others like you
Brothers as blue
Smiling on the street of dreams
 
Love laughs at a king
Kings don't mean a thing
On the street of dreams
Dreams broken in two can be made like new 
On the street of dreams
Gold, sliver and gold
All you can hold is in the moonbeams
Poor, no one is poor
Long as love is sure
On the street of dreams
 
Midnight, look at the steeple, it's midnight
Unhappy people, it's ringing with joy
It's ringing with cheer
'Cause yesterday's gone
Tomorrow is near
Midnight, the heart is lighter at midnight
Things will be brighter the moment you find
More of your kind
Smiling on the street of dreams
 
Love laughs at a king
Kings don't mean a thing

Kim Richmond Ensemble,"You don't know what love is
'Til you've learned the meaning of the blues
Until you've loved a love you've had  to lose,
You don't know what love  is.

You don't know how lips hurt
Until you've kissed and had to pay the cost,
Until you've flipped your heart and you have lost,
You don't know what love is.

Do you know how a lost heart fears
At the thought of reminiscing,
And how lips that taste of tears
Lose their taste for kissing?

All through the night,

Gonna leave this place and hope I start

And every single fear of being without you

Go to the place where everyone goes to Boogaloo all night long

With her rattlesnake boots, elephant bag, genuine crocodile hat
Around her neck to top it off she even wears a Persian cat

I got put on math

Running from jakes, running in gates
Check out the main face 
We gotta gas and erase
Me not the ambitious one
I rather be there throw a word or two in

Your earth respects you twice

That's when I caught on
Sell these niggas the illusion
And plus live it out on spite
Yo the block is draining and scary
A nigga might die out here 
Or be in some jail law library
Unlawful entry a century
Fuck I want to live in jail?
I'm already in ghetto penitentiary

And who bit off the last nigga tape stole his state
Wake up we running outta plans

Tricknology is in one hand
Future's so far to see
The present's how will it be
The past don't even ask just believe
Looking in the dictionary 
Trying to spell out hard words
Define 'em and design 'em 
I shine and curve
Take this jewel in and conquer me
I blend it in wit ganja
Not for the babies it's a mind sponsor
From the seventeen million God raised 
Two million lost slaved
Nineteen million may we all praise
So when we wake up
Let's straighten up and get it together
For real and keep all getting paper

And I fall on my face
With angels and saints

I'm looking for you 
Drifting on a memory 
Ain't no place I'd rather be 
Than with you, loving you 
Day will make a way for night 
All we'll need is candlelight 
And a song soft and long, well 
Glad to be here alone 
With a lover unlike no other 
Safe to see a new horizon 
Slowly coming into view 

I wanna be living for the love of you 
All that I'm giving is for the love of you 

Lovely as a ray of sun 
That touches me when the morning comes 
Feels good to me, my love and me 
Smoother than a gentle breeze 
Flowing through my mind with ease 
Soft as can be well when you're loving me 
Love to be Riding the waves of your love 
Enchanted with your touch It seems to me 
We can sail together in and out of mystery 

I wanna be living for the love of you 
All that I'm giving is for the love of you 

Paradise I have within 
Can't feel insecure again 
You're the key and this I see 
Now and then I lose my way 
Using words to try and say 
What I feel yeah love is real 
Ooh I might as well 
Sign my name on a card 
Which could say it better 
Time will tell 
'Cause it seems that I've done 
Just about all that I can do do do 

I wanna be living for the love of you 
All that I'm giving is for the love of you",For the Love of You,1991
Kim Waters,"If your heart's in doubt, my love
Worried about my love
Then all your fear
Is only foolish fancy, dear
If I didn't care more than words can say
If I didn't care would I feel this way? 
If this isn't love
Then maybe I'm wrong
But why do I lie awake all night
And dream all day long? 
If I didn't care would it be the same? 
Would every prayer begin and end with just your name? 
And would I be sure that this is love beyond compare? 
Would all this be true
If I didn't care for you?",If I Didn't Care,1992
Kim Waters,"They asked me how I knew
My true love was true
Oh, I of course replied
Something here inside cannot be denied 

They said someday you'll find
All who love are blind
Oh, when your heart's on fire
You must realize
Smoke gets in your eyes

So I chaffed them and I gaily laughed
To think they could doubt my love
Yet today my love has flown away
I am without my love

Now laughing friends deride
Tears I can not hide
Oh, so I smile and say
When a lovely flame dies
Smoke gets in your eyes
Smoke gets in your eyes",Smoke Gets in Your Eyes,1992
Kim Waters,"You'll never know just how much I miss you
You'll never know just how much I care
And if I tried, I still couldn't hide my love for you 
You ought to know, for haven't I told you so
 
A million or more times?
You went away and my heart went with you
I speak your name in my every prayer
If there is some other way to prove that I love you

I swear I don't know how
You'll never know if you don't know now

Kim Waters,"Sometimes the snow comes down in June
Sometimes the sun goes 'round the moon
I see the passion in your eyes
Sometimes it's all a big surprise
'Cause there was a time when all I did was wish
You'd tell me this was love
It's not the way I hoped or how I planned
But somehow it's enough

And now we're standing face to face
Isn't this world a crazy place
Just when I thought our chance had passed
You go and save the best for last

All of the nights you came to me
When some silly girl had set you free
You wondered how you'd make it through
I wondered what was wrong with you

'Cause how could you give your love to someone else
And share your dreams with me
Sometimes the very thing you're looking for
Is the one thing you can't see

And now we're standing face to face
Isn't this world a crazy place

But then a miracle happened;
Heaven must have sent you, I know

Used to feel like a heavy load

Searchin' 'til you come back to me

As if they know the hurt I bear

And I need some consolation
'Cause my mind is in a confusion
And my heart feels much confusion
Since you've been gone it keeps me cryin' cryin' cryin' cryin'

In the shelter of your love my strength I found
But now I'm useless, since you're not around
I'm helpless

Oh I'm helpless
Since I lost your love
Helpless
'Cause now I need your love
I never needed no one before
But now I need you more and more
Ever since you've been gone it keeps me cryin' cryin' cryin' cryin'

I'm helpless 'til you come back to me
Helpless in this world of grieve
I need your words of confidence
I need those happy times we spent
I'm in a hopeless feel confusion
And your love is your solution

It's my fault
And I won't search for you no longer
As I go home alone
Needing you to stop

I'm in a helpless situation
And I need some consolation
And my mind is in a confusion
And I'm having these strange illusions
Loneliness deep inside keeps me cryin' cryin' cryin' cryin'

In a helpless situation
And I need your consolation

Sing a song full of the hope
That the present has brought us

Facing the rising sun
Of our new day begun
Let us march on till victory is won

Stony, the road we trod
Bitter, the chastening rod
Felt in the days we've hoped
When unborn had died

Yet with a steady beat
Have not our weary feet
Come to the place
On which our fathers sighed

Let us march on till victory is won

I feel the wind of change about to blow

There is a face of youth with disillusion
Don't look for the reasons

I can't get enough of how you love

If you come over - I could be good for you

Getting reports on the weather
You were coming home, had caught the last flight
But we would soon be together
You'd been gone such a long time
When my radio gave the warning

Chaos at the airport tonight, something ain't right
No-one can land in the weather
Planes are crashing out of control
And all in all I think you've lost him forever

Looking up I started searching the skies
Was he still up there above me
Was the man who'd waved a million goodbyes
Now just a stranger who loved me
But as I drove to the terminal sign
I heard a great loud explosion

Chaos at the airport tonight, something ain't right
No-one can land in the weather
Planes are crashing out of control
And all in all I think you've lost him forever

I ran so, so fast but if I could only reach you
But you're so far away, you're oh so far away
Landing lights approaching
Out from a sea of darkness
But you're so far away, you're oh so far away

Like a bird of death it hovered around
Until the wheels started turning
Then I saw the jets just touching the ground
And I could see it recurring
And as I looked for the last time
My radio gave the warning",Chaos at the Airport,1982

See all the changes I know somethings wrong
But when I think back to the love that we had

As a soft stream running over me
But I always knew there would be a way out
But for you, not for me

Now all I see is the trace of a smile
Memories forgotten a long time ago
Never believed I could see you this way

Who was there just to watch over me

And blown into the wind
She was just heading for trouble
When they got her downstairs

Cut by the lights, strands of her hair
Just tumble from her cheeks
She's just another Caucasian in a crime worn day

Inside her heart was breaking
No-one knew what she'd been through
Inside her mind's escaping
To a world that no-one knew

Lost in the night, somebody said go easy on the girl
You'll never get a confession
If you treat her that way
Two pairs of eyes shout at her face and late into the night
They heard a softer whisper saying
""Let me go""

Inside her heart was breaking
No-one knew what she'd been through
Inside her mind's escaping
To a world that no-one knew

Wendy sadd has flown away
Wendy found her freedom
No-one else could follow there
Not inside the world of Wendy sadd

Somebody shouts, something is wrong and panick hits the room
They said she looked at the ceiling and the lights went out
Clutched in her hand
All they could find was a letter that she'd wrote
It said try and forgive them
For what they've done

Inside her heart was breaking
No-one knew what she'd been through
Inside her mind's escaping
To a world that no-one knew

Then I see your faces, only for fraction
Did you hurt my feelings ? You just nailed me to the wall

Never show a good hand, never give a notion
Don't you feel it's obscene ? Do you feel a thing at all ?

Words fell down
You walk right back to the sound of glory

And I'm wondering if there'll ever be room for me
in Shangri-la
Wondering now - do you love me - and now
As I burn with a dangerous desire
Is our time up and on to the next fire
Got my fingers burnt and cut into the wire
Do you think we will ever learn

As we keep looking our Shangri-la...
Our Shangri-la
But we wouldn't know it . . .
If it hit us in the face
If it hit us in the face

Out in the rain

Gazing through the window
Clutching her books
Memorizing every line

A crime against them
Against you and me
A crime against all humanity

Heard it on the news today
What are we doing to our world
There's got to be a better way
And we've got to choose it

Don't you know that a day will come
To everyone
When they'll ask us to explain
Are we going to say that we weren't to blame
Who else could there be

Just like in a dream
I'm trying to scream
I feel paralysed
Unable to cry
What are we doing

Heard it on the news today
What are we doing to our world
There's got to be a better way
Or we're gonna lose it

Who's to blame?",Who's to Blame,1990
Kim Wilde,"Written by ricki & kim wilde

Let's think of the good things
Instead of all the bad
We mustn't give into
A world that's going mad
So hold on, we can survive
We've got to keep the spirit
Of destiny alive
Just say that we can if we try

Like the rivers need the mountains
Just like the flowers need the rain
Pleasure need the pain
However far away it seems
I'm dreaming for a world
In perfect armony

And we've got to face it
There's nowhere left to hide
(but we need) a determination
To change the wrong to right
The future's a baby born
Looking for us for strength
To keep it from harm
You know we'll succeed if we try

Like the rivers need the mountains
Just like flowers need the rain
Pleasure need the pain
How ever far away it seems
I'm dreaming for a world
In perfect harmony

Don't let your dreams escape
The future's ours to shape
",World in Perfect Harmony,1990
Kim Wilde,"Did I say something wrong
Well if I`ve hurt you then tell me now
Don`t let your fear surround you
Why don`t you talk to me

Well I know what you want
And I know what you need
But believe me baby
They may not be the same
Think it over

Deep in my heart
There`s a place that only you can find
But still there`s a part
Of my life wrapped in confusion
I can`t tell you I`m in love
But I can`t stand to lose you
Please believe me when I say I do
I believe in you, believe in you

Some people believe in love
I`d rather believe in something real
Something that lasts forever
That`s why I`m still with you

So you`re head over heals
And I know now it feels
But believe me baby
It won`t be the same
When it`s over

Deep in my heart
There`s a place that only you can find
But still there`s a part
Of my life wrapped in confusion
I can`t tell you I`m in love
But I can`t stand to lose you
Please believe me when I say I do
I believe in you, believe in you

I only want to save you pain
We`ll find a way
To change your heart
And throw away these chains of love",I Believe in You,1992

I lose the fear of the shadows in the night
But then the moment you're gone every thing's wrong
It never felt this strong

Baby, hold on
A miracle's coming
Can you believe it?
Take it in and breathe it

Baby, hold on
A miracle's coming
You gotta understand
It's right here in our hands
I know

I hear the questions when you look into my eyes
You're scared of rumors, but I tell you they're only lies
This is forever, how can either of us be sure?
All I can tell you is I never felt this before
I know

But the moment you're here every thing's right
I lose the fear of the shadows in the night

And find you can't let go
You need someone who can lift you up
To get ready for tomorrow

I am in ecstasy
Boy, what you doing to me

Took me by surprise
When I saw the passion in your eyes
Now I've got you here
Life is is good and feel satisfied
Now I'm flying with the birds above
I'm floating to the moon
Got the clouds to walk on every day
And the stars shine when you walk in the room

Couldn't take anymore of the heartache and pain
I know I should take it slow but,

Playing safe is no way to survive
There's a chance for us, we can make it
Give our love room to breathe to keep it alive
Admit that we made mistakes but
I know in my heart that it's not too late

Chorus :
'cause you, baby, you hypnotise
I just have to look in your eyes
I'm in a daze, I lose control
Deeper inside my mind
I'm leaving the real world behind
I give to you my heart and my soul

It feels like I'm falling in love with you all over again
And I'm trying not to let it show
But the minute I see you I just let go
I just have to look in your eyes
I'm in a daze, I lose control



",Hypnotise,1995
Kim Wilde,"I will always love you
Now and forever
I will always love you
Two words collide
Before we knew what was happening
Love crashed into our lives
So helplessly we fell so hard
Guess something had to break
We made our first mistake
We thought we'd found the answer over night
To all the problems that were in our lives
And now I feel the tears
And not a minute passes by
When I don't wish
That you were near
Time will never mend (oh no)
This broken heart
Now and forever
I will always love you
Pain that never ends (oh oh)
You can be sure
Now and forever
I will always love you
When you hear my name
Tell me how do you fell
Is it just like me
My heart fills up with pain
Just the mention of you makes me fall apart
But where is there to start
You sais we missed our chance and it's too late
But I believe there's one more chance to take
I know we said goodbye
But I still can't let go
Please give us one more try
Time will never mend (oh no)
This broken heart
Now and forever
I will always love you
Pain that never ends (oh oh)
You can be sure
Now and forever
I will always love you
Think again before you walk away
There's so many reasons you should stay
It's our destiny
It how it's got to be
Just you and me
No matter where you go
No matter what you do
You know I'm gonna be right here for you
I will always love you
Giving you my heart
Giving you my soul
Never ever gonna let you go

I'll be true
I won't lie baby
Trust me when I say
You're asking me where is it we go from here
The answer is open in my mind
Who knows where we'll end our journey
Love is a lesson
We're still just learning
But one thing you can be sure of is

I'll be true
I won't lie baby
I'll never lie to you
I'll be true
Trust me when I say
True to you

So many people make the same mistakes
Giving promises they can't keep
And after their hearts are broken
With words they both wish had never been spoken
And lies that they pin their hope on but

I'll be true
I won't lie baby
I'll never lie to you
I'll be true
Trust me when I say
True to you

Love and honesty is what you're gonna get from me
Every step of the way
You can trust me, when I say

I'll be true
I won't lie baby
I'll never lie to you
I'll be true
Trust me when I say
True to you

I won't waste your time baby

Hey, hey don't look so far away boy
Tell me what you're thinking
You say you're scared my love won't stay
Don't get lost in superstition
What does it take
For two hearts to trust enough to stay together
When is it safe
For two friends to turn into lovers forever
Why don't you know
By now you know me so very well
If you're asking then I'll tell
Where do you go from here
Straight to my heart that's where you belong
Where do you go from here
Straight to my heart that's where you belong
Hey, hey nothing could ever change the course of our collision
No fear we're destined to be here it's not even our decision
It's out of our hands
Love is a precious gift that we're given
Love as a plan
So don't try to read the writing in the heavens
You'll understand
The answers in my touch and my kiss
Boy you can be sure of this
Where do you go from here
Straight to my heart that's where you belong
Where do you go from here
Straight to my heart
Forever to be as one
Don't even try to deny the feeling deep in your soul
'cause you know that love will always take control
It's out of your hands

Just couldn't take it all

As though he lived a dream
And as she held him close
He used to search her face
As though she knew the truth
Lost inside Cambodia

Closing doors never looking round but it's not goodbye
They'll be there till I'm taken out I know

You shouldn't let your big heart show

Moving around it I know

Now I'm gonna stay forever
'cause you know I need you
Never gonna leave you
Now I'm gonna stay forever

I can't say goodbye
And you know I tried to walk away
But the feeling deep inside of my soul
Told me to stay
'cause I can't say goodbye

I can't say goodbye
In the night I will be there
I will always stay around
In the day
I will be there if you call
'cause I can't say goodbye
",I Can't Say Goodbye,2001
Kim Wilde,"Written by ricki & kim wilde

I've been looking all around the world
To see what I could find
Just a lot of broken promises
And people left behind
Oh and the - pain of being lonely
Is what everybody fears
Yeah, it took a lot of time for me to realise

It's here, looking me in the eye
It's here, here all the time
It's here, I've always tried to find a way to go
But now I know
It's here

You can spend your life competing
In a world that talks too loud
You can lose your own direction
Getting lost among the crowd
Confusion - is it any wonder
That the road ahead's not clear
Well you can try too hard to find it
Now I realise

It's here, looking me in the eye
It's here, here all the time
It's here, I've always tried to find a way to go
",It's Here,2001
Kim Wilde,"Well it sounded like a whisper
But soon became a cry
And the moment that I touch you
I know the reason why - we got love
No union is stronger than a woman with a man
I'm gonna give love in the natural way
With everything I can
Never mind if things go wrong
You and I will still be strong
And how I love you now

Oh baby, we're here tonight
We can make it last forever
Wen can make it last for life
Oh, baby, no matter what
I'm gonna give love in the natural way
With everything I got

All times it can be gentle
And at times it can be cruel
It can treat you like a stranger
It can treat you like a fool
But tonight I wanna hold you
Cos tonight you're gonna see
I'm gonna give you love in the natural way
And keep you here with me
Lovin' like you've never known
Now at last We're on our own
And I still love you now

Oh, baby, we're here tonight
We can make it last forever
We can make it last for life
Oh, babe, it's me and you
And it's a natural reaction
When you feel the way we do
What is left that's still unknown
Let's discover on our own

Cos when love's the culmination
Of everything you feel
Well it's the only thing that's precious
It's the only thing that's real",Love in the Natural Way,2001
Kim Wilde,"(This I swear...)
Each and every way I can
I will prove to you
I've got a fortune in my hands when I'm holding you
Never want to let you go again
And that's the truth
I will try and answer all your prayers
This I swear

There's always a danger
There's always a fear
Love's not gonna make it out of here
I'm not asking for perfection
Just want a love that's true
And in return
I'll do my best for you
It seems the higher we climb
The further we fall together
But right here, I'll vow
Baby, I promise you know

Each and every way I can
I will prove to you
I've got a fortune in my hands when I'm holding you
Never want to let you go again
And that's the truth
I will try and answer all your prayers
This I swear

We each have our moments
Our times of doubt
But I know deep down
Don't want to live without you
You're the exception to the rule
'cause where love's concerned
I guess I've been a fool
I know it's a long, long road
But as long as we stand together
Right here, I'll vow
Baby I promise you now

Each and every way I can
I will prove to you
I've got a fortune in my hands when I'm holding you

Kim Wilde,"A long time ago, you promised yourself
They're all gonna know me someday
Well, you got what you wanted but look at you now
You lost something good on the way
So where did it go? Tell me, where did it go?
But you wouldn't know

Snap your fingers and somebody runs
You don't care how they feel just as long as they come
Got your head in the stars, now you've come this far
Just who do you think you are?

Now everything seems to be going your way
And everyone loves what they see
But you ruin it all with the things that you say
So tell me, how does it feel?
When you're all alone, how does it feel?
You're alone, nothing is real

Snap your fingers and somebody runs
You don't care how they feel just as long as they come
Got your head in the stars, now you've come this far
Just who do you think you are?

You believe a ridiculous lie
You can't see you've become all the things you despise
But I know who you are and you've gone too far
Just who do you think you are?

You can keep all your dreams
But you don't have to lose yourself
'Cause one day, you're gonna break
When the face in the mirror looking back at you
Is a stranger that you can't place, oh, oh
Just who do you think you are?

Snap your fingers and somebody runs
You don't care how they feel just as long as they come
Got your head in the stars, now you've come this far
Just who do you think you are?

Bet you're wonderin' where I am,

Got no comfort on the telephone,
Went out and caught me a midnight flight,
Thought a little love would make it all alright,
But the landlord said you moved away and left me all of your bills to pay,
Look out baby I think you might have made your move too soon.

He left me with a Keno card, livin' in Vegas ain't too hard,
I ran it up to about 50 grand, counted it out and held it in my hand,
That kinda word will get around, and make a lost love come up found,
I hear ya knockin' baby at my door, but you don't live here no more,
Oh no, I think he made his move too soon.

Kimball Carpentier,"Look at me
I'm as helpless as a kitten up a tree
And I feel like I'm clinging to a cloud
I can't understand
I get misty, holding your hand

Walk my way
And a thousand violins begin to play
Or it might be the sound of your hello
That music I hear
I get misty the moment you're near

You can say that you're leading me on
But it's just what I want you to do
Don't you realize how hopelessly I'm lost
That's why I'm following you

On my own
Would I wander through this wonderland alone
Never knowing my right foot from my left
My hat from my glove
I get misty, and too much in love

I'm too misty, and too much in love",Misty,2008

And I’m proud to be an American, where at least I know I’m free
And I won't forget the ones who died, who gave that right to me
And I gladly stand up next to you and defend her still today

Across the plains of Texas from sea to shining sea
From Detroit down to Houston and New York to L.A.
Well there's pride in every American heart and it's time we stand and say

One thing led to another
Now we hardly speak to each other
It's so strange, so strange

[Chorus:]
(You've changed)
I miss the conversation
Miss the stimulation
Mis communicating
(You've changed)
I miss the lovey-dovey
Feel it when you hug me
Know you still love me
So don't change(Don't change)

Used to make love for hours 
Turn right around and take long hot showers
But now we just go through the motions
What's love if there ain't no emotion
Just ain't the same, ain't the same

The beautiful thing that we had
Used to be good now it hurts me so bad
Now when I look in your eyes
All I see is emptiness inside
You can't disguise, can't deny

[Chorus]
(You've changed)
I miss the conversation
Miss the stimulation
Miss communicating
(You've changed)
I miss the lovey-dovey
Feel it when you hug me
Know you still love me
So don't change(Don't change)

Used to go everywhere 
Where there was one there was always the other
Now you're out all night
Act like we ain't even together
Use to call every hour on the hour
Didn't need no excuse
If you wanna get it right, keep it tight
Make it all right, baby
Please don't change

[Chorus]
(You've changed)
I miss the conversation
Miss the stimulation
Miss communicating

The most of our lives

I pray for a miracle to come my way

Kimberly,"We are servants of the night
Stalkers, hunters, miscreants
Creatures of a black domain
Sleepless, sunless revenants

I will defy the separation
Of darkness and light, this I swear
Fuse them together, unite them as one
Power is mine!

Playing with fire, you're end up burning
Consequence for your mistake

We fear the day for the sun
Await the dusk, sacrifice
We roam the earth, take the flesh
Dwelling among Satan's lair

When darkness falls
They appear to blind eyes
When the shadows wake, silence breaks
We stand helpless

Death! I have brought death to light
Hell! Welcome to hell my dear

Fall! Your fallen fall from grace
Look what you've done

Come! Join me in damnation

No! I will not follow you!

Night will overwhelm us

Alone in the dark!

We are servants of the night
Stalkers, hunters, miscreants
Creatures of a black domain
Sleepless, sunless revenants

Crossing the gates into hell

You shall obey!

Kimberly Barber,"She climbs a tree and scrapes her knee
Her dress has got a tear
She waltzes on her way to Mass
And whistles on the stair
And underneath her wimple
She has curlers in her hair
I even heard her singing in the abbey

She's always late for chapel
But her penitence is real
She's always late for everything
Except for every meal
I hate to have to say it
But I very firmly feel
Maria's not an asset to the abbey

I'd like to say a word in her behalf
Maria makes me laugh

How do you solve a problem like Maria?
How do you catch a cloud and pin it down?
How do you find a word that means Maria?

A will-o'-the wisp! 
A clown!

Many a thing you know you'd like to tell her
Many a thing she ought to understand
But how do you make her stay
And listen to all you say
How do you keep a wave upon the sand

Oh, how do you solve a problem like Maria?
How do you hold a moonbeam in your hand?

When I'm with her I'm confused
Out of focus and bemused
And I never know exactly where I am
Unpredictable as weather
She's as flighty as a feather
She's a darling! She's a demon! She's a lamb!

She'd out pester any pest
Drive a hornet from its nest
She could throw a whirling dervish out of whirl
She is gentle! She is wild!
She's a riddle! She's a child!
She's a headache! She's an angel!
She's a girl!

And I had to start again with just my children and my wife

And I’m proud to be an American, where at least I know I’m free
And I won't forget the ones who died, who gave that right to me
And I gladly stand up next to you and defend her still today
‘Cause there ain't no doubt I love this land, God bless the U.S.A.

Across the plains of Texas from sea to shining sea
From Detroit down to Houston and New York to L.A.

Killing me softly with his song

Telling my life with his words

I heard he had a style
And so I came to see him to listen for awhile

Embarrassed by the crowd
I felt he found my letters and read each out loud

Has me on the blink

I'm wild again, beguiled again
A whimpering, simpering child again

Couldn't sleep, wouldn't sleep
Love came and told me, shouldn't sleep
Bewitched, bothered and bewildered, am I

I lost my heart, but what of it
She is cold I agree
She might laugh, but I love it

For they both have the very same sensation
When you're locked in the magic of a kiss

Beware my foolish heart

Seem to follow me wherever I go
Though I try and try to hide my feelings

And I always have to say no
Tell me why is it so

That I never can say goodbye, no, no, no, no, now

And start heading for the door
There's a very strange vibration
Piercing me right through the core

Soon are all gonna work out

There's that anguish, there's that doubt
It's the same old dizzy hangup
Can't do with you or without

Run from Angela Vickers

Monday morning small talking on the avenue
She's got a fancy car
She wants to take you far
From the city lights and sounds deep into the dark

Star so light and star so bright
First star i see tonight!

You wanna know what I really believe

Look through my eyes, I'm your binocular
And every time you get a shock you'll learn
What's it like to be in my dimension
I'll be the center of your attention

The quiet prose and the crack in my snare
Make your mark on my territory
Carve your name in every cavity

But I don't go for them
I can't move to that beat

I like Marvin Gaye and gospel music

You always spoil my favorite parts

I learned to read at this old academy

You're out make every man
Your fleeting dream
But I'm a one-man woman
I'm all down with monogamy

You cuss and curse
So they think that you're rough and tough
But I like Shakespeare
And I find dammit heavy enough

You like new age
All the rage, philosophy
But I don't read my palms
I read the psalms
They speak to me

Don't wanna be in your posse girl
I don't wanna
Be caught in your social machine

Don't wanna be in your posse girl

I'm a self-confessed

I'm not your type, I don't fit in

And I send my apologies

I've been down the street, where they offer good deals
I'm shaking hands with the man who says he'll give me my dreams
Reaching up for a taste from the hand that feeds
I feel it growing from a whisper, to a shout and a fist in the air
I could smell the fire from miles away,
But I was always going to run after the chase
I didn't leave you, I just went my way

I know I've been here before
It must have been years or more
Like the first the day that I got off of the plane
And nobody cared to know of my name
I think I've been here

I've grown out of my own muse
But my heart, it hasn't changed
Sally I can see you, you're not the girl you once used to be

There's a melody I'm missing
But your song travels out to me still

But I was always going to run after the storm
I didn't leave you, I just leapt out from the shore.

Ooh it's not like it was before.
My hair's short and my jeans are tight.
Time passed in the night time over my head
Suddenly, I'm in the sea, and I'm unprepared
I wish you'd been here.

Sally I can see you, I'm not the girl I once used to be
I feel so light in my years
In my heart, it has no sense
Sally I can see you, you're not the girl you once used to be
I don't know how I got here
But my heart it hasn't changed

I let go of your hand, I knew our time was measured
I sailed out to foreign lands, just to fly together
There's a child that I left in the town I treasure
I'm running fast but I'm not running away

Sally I can see you, I'm not the girl I was
I don't know how I got here.

On the highway, but I'm barefoot
I need a map but not the destination
Need a compass but not a conversation

I want to run far from this grey town
You're on every street, marked on the ground
Not the meant and not the paint
Want the price but not the raise

I want the jump but not the height
Let me fall but catch me mid flight
I swam with sharks and beasts of the sea
Only went down for the company
Went down for the company

I forgot to mention
That you would come back home when I call
Left no sign, nothing at all
Sorry you won't fit inside my heart
I wanted love without the build up

I need the rules but not the regulations
Want the wisdom but not the information
Need the light but not the heat of the day
Need your hands to show me how to pray

Of all the dots and lines that took me higher
Away from traffic and smiles of tire
I like the nights but not the tangled wires

Need the pulse to feel alive
All the world's just made it seem all quiet
This has all become far too loud

But there's no love, no love,
There's nothing to take your place

Now I can't spend a minute
Now I can't steal the time
I've lost all my friends like money
I've lost all my men to the sky

I can't keep your loving from my mind
It's worth more than gold, crystals and pride
Ready to shake these stars from me

Oh, I can't withdraw your heart from mine
You're the one thing that sticks right onto my side
No, I can't withdraw your heart from mine
How'd I get so stuck, so stuck to your side?

No I can't withdraw your heart from mine
You're the one thing that sticks, right into my side
I can't withdraw your heart from mine.",Withdraw,2011

Where have I been all these years?

How long has this been going on?

There were chills up my spine,
And some thrills I can't define.
Listen, sweet, I repeat,
How long has this been going on?

Into Heaven I'm hurled!
I know how Columbus felt,
Finding another world.

Hey man let me ask you something man
You ever have one of them days where you felt like
You might to got rid of all the bad seeds in your life?
You know what I mean like you just got your paycheck
Paid off a car note or something
Just jumped out the shower feeling fresh than a motherfucker
With ya good shoes on, what you know what I'm talking bout?
(You mean like, paid off a Cadillac car note?)
Like a Cadillac, like you ready to throw a party
Like call everybody you know, don't even plan it, just do it
(In Compton we call that ""spur of the moment"")
Well let's do it, spur of the moment, what up?

[Ludacris]
Well you can bring the drinks a little mo' my way
More I say, on another hot sunny Cali-for-nye day
Just touched down, called up my 8-1-8
Fo' a date with some other bust downs
And I cruised up the block, car lost up the top
I take the breeze, quick break the trees
Feel good as we flipping through the Robb Repo't
My baby momma ain't tripping on child support

[DJ Quik]
Because she can't support that garbage, she should come pay homage
When we pair 'em, we goin' share 'em, when I'm finished we all switch
I ain't really got the time, yo I'm chilling with Luda
'Cris stop and twist the Buddha got me feeling like this is it
If we goin' party, we goin' sip, we got a bar
We all in shape, we goin' go far, you can't stop the car
We on the freeway, if you get out you burnt
You would of thought you would of learned me when my hair was all permed
I think y'all bullshittin with it dog

It's on tonight, get licked, get gone tonight

Arabian Spruce, Seagram's bumpy and juice
We used to bag and then truce, we used to sag and get loose
Not the kind of cats that would jump in your bag for your jewels
But to put some money in it for your drink and your shoes
We get the News like MTV, every ten to the hour
We play Mario Brothers, we eat the 'shroom and get power
Now eat your sour powers, and use your dental floss
What does being mental cost? If you ain't knowing you already lost

[Ludacris]
So stay with me, and let's get tipsy
Remembering the days on the block sipping whiskey

You ain't gotta look mean, I know you care for your girl
But she's looking this way and I'm gonna come get her
Fresh haircut, so I'm feeling quite differ
Can't nothing go wrong cause my strap's on my back
And if fools want to scrap then my tool will attack
But forget the click-clack, ain't no need for the steel
Just a straight house party and some meat on the grill

Gotta keep it a secret (woo!)
Hey man let me ask you something man
You ever have one of them days where you felt like
You might to got rid of all the bad seeds in your life?
You know what I mean like you just got your paycheck
Paid off a car note or something
Just jumped out the shower feeling fresh than a motherfucker
With ya good shoes on, what you know what I'm talking bout?
(You mean like, paid off a Cadillac car note?)
Like a Cadillac, like you ready to throw a party
Like call everybody you know, don't even plan it, just do it
(In Compton we call that ""spur of the moment"")
Well let's do it, spur of the moment, what up?

[Ludacris]
Well you can bring the drinks a little mo' my way
More I say, on another hot sunny Cali-for-nye day
Just touched down, called up my 8-1-8
Fo' a date with some other bust downs
And I cruised up the block, car lost up the top
I take the breeze, quick break the trees
Feel good as we flipping through the Robb Repo't
My baby momma ain't tripping on child support

[DJ Quik]
Because she can't support that garbage, she should come pay homage
When we pair 'em, we goin' share 'em, when I'm finished we all switch
I ain't really got the time, yo I'm chilling with Luda
'Cris stop and twist the Buddha got me feeling like this is it
If we goin' party, we goin' sip, we got a bar
We all in shape, we goin' go far, you can't stop the car
We on the freeway, if you get out you burnt
You would of thought you would of learned me when my hair was all permed
I think y'all bullshittin with it dog

[Chorus: Ludacris (Kimmi)]
It's on tonight, get licked, get gone tonight
(And for once, in my life, everything's gonna be, alright)
G'd up, my mind is freed up
(From the day, through the night, everything's gonna be, alright)

[DJ Quik]
Arabian Spruce, Seagram's bumpy and juice
We used to bag and then truce, we used to sag and get loose
Not the kind of cats that would jump in your bag for your jewels
But to put some money in it for your drink and your shoes
We get the News like MTV, every ten to the hour
We play Mario Brothers, we eat the 'shroom and get power
Now eat your sour powers, and use your dental floss
What does being mental cost? If you ain't knowing you already lost

[Ludacris]
So stay with me, and let's get tipsy
Remembering the days on the block sipping whiskey
Running 'round grinning, running 'round sinning
Getting lit, then I wonder why my head kept spinning

No, I just passed on through it like a lonely town.

Everywhere I turned I tuned in something that you had to say.

I'd bid this place goodbye to come and be with you
But I can hardly stand and I got nowhere to run
Another sinking sun and one more lonely night

The wind keeps blowing somewhere everyday
Tell me things get better, somewhere, up the way
Just dismal thinking on a dismal day
And the sad songs for us to bare

I'd bid this place goodbye to come and be with you

You know sometimes I write happy songs
Then some little thing goes wrong

Kimmie Rhodes,"I always go the other way but my car drove me down today
To a little house on the older side of town
Back when things were never hard I used to play there in that yard
And I just drove by to see if things had changed
Cokes were just a nickel then and across the street at the five and ten
A lot of things were cheap and square and strange
And the life that we had might have been but it was one we loved believin' in
And I just drove by to see if things had changed
I wondered now if love is still the way it was back then
I need to know that life is still a place worth livin' in
There it is just like it was a place where there was always love
And I just drove by to see if things had changed

In a world that seen it's better days it's good to know some things remain the same
Though standing still is not times way

That love is somewhere
Livin on an island all alone
I can see it in the darkness
I can feel it in the distance
And then its gone
And then I know that it is time 
For me to go and find my favorite girl
Cause when I look into her eyes I see
All the love there is in all the world
And it always will be
And it always will be
And it always will be
It always will be
There are some things I think about
And every time I do it breaks my heart
And there is nothing I can do
About this lonliness I feel when we're apart
I stop and curse the darkness and the distance
And then your face I see
And when I look into your eyes I see
All the love there is inside of me

What you've seen is what I've been
There is nothing that I can hide a few you see me better than I can
Out on the road that lies before me now there are some turns where I will spin
I only hope that you will hold me now till I gain control again

So I live on the outskirts of the back of my mind
With a strong hand a songman and God on my side
I'm writing that freedom a line at a time
On the highway to nowhere that runs through my mind
A yellow line stretches out into the night
Broken in places it's my guiding light
So I'm writing that freedom a line at a time
I'm walking a fine line between wrong and right
I can live with the problems of this day and time
Consider me lucky cause I'll be all right
In my mind I'm having a beautiful life

In search of the border of infinite time

I feel ya (hey)
I know how it is
Mama's just a little girl
Don't nobody understand
I feel ya

She was born a heavy set girl with pigtails and curls
A heart full of gold, still it won't change the world
Though she could never understand why
Some underhanded plans witnessed a man die
Was only fifteen, should have been a beauty queen, still
See her crying by the caskets when her parents got killed
Little girl don't cry, 'cause even though they died
You can best believe they're watching over thee from the sky
Never asked for this misery, but look at what you're getting
Is a blessing in disguise when you find out you're pregnant
No money, no home, and even though you're all alone
You gots to do this on your own, so baby go
I wish you luck and if you need me, call
Just come to me and let me feed you all
I can understand the way it feels when you're fighting the world
Facing all this drama when mama's just a little girl

Mama don't know why
Mama's just a little girl
Living if she is or not oh
Time ain't on her side
'Cause mama's just a little girl (mama is just a little girl)
She gotta hold her head up high oh

At sixteen, what a beautiful thing
The very essence of a jet-black ebony queen
And who could tell she'd get pregnant at an early age? (what?)
She didn't listen, had sex, watch her belly raise (hey)
Got violated by someone she dated, if this is fate
I'd hate to see the seeds she created, and so we waited
Though it takes time to build a body and a mind
She reclines nine months then finally it's time
What do we find? Little growing boy of mine
With a tortured soul, addicted to a life of crime
Had no time for the growing stage
He learned his values on the streets at an early age
Watch for police, don't come home (why?)
'cause mama's acting crazy at the hospital
About to have another baby, like a rose from the concrete
Growing within, blessed with twins
How the hell can mama raise three men?
So we began, closest family, such insanity
A happy home from one act of inhumanity
Plus mama said they seed was corrupt, it used to rub
Her belly, begging to let us breathe if she loved us
Now, mama, since quiet, sipping peppermint Schnapps
Turned the house into a spot and made her watch for cops hey
How could mama bring a thug like me into the world?
She ain't the cause of all this drama
'Cause mama's just a little girl

Mama don't know why
Mama's just a little girl
Living if she is or not, oh
Time ain't on her side
'Cause mama's just a little girl (mama is just a little girl)
She gotta hold her head up high, oh

Now, will she remain in the same spot?
The gunshots rang, they came from the 'caine spot
Now, look here, I see her clutching her son in her arms, she's hurt
Her heart bleeds, now she watched her seed die in the dirt
Fulfil prophecies, but who could stop the grief
I walk around trying to hold the world up on top of me
Probably be an innocent man, still I'm the victim of a curse
What could be worse? Nothing but pain since my birth
Only functions at the pen, 'cause everybody's in
Paying back society, I'm guilty of a life of sin
I watch the drama occur, my eyes blur before I jetted
I wonder why we all have to die before we get it
Though we shed tears, so many peers I've done buried
Worried and scared, knowing I'm going to see the cemetery
Must be prepared in this cold world no one cares
Knowing it ain't fair, but we all bear and do our share
In this land of the underhanded schemes and plans
Vivid dreams of a nigga having G's in hand
Mama told me not to be a punk
Fuck what you talking about, coward, what you niggaz want? (hey)
There ain't a thing I wouldn't do for my mama in this world
'Cause you know I ain't mad at cha, you're just a little girl
See mama is just a little girl (Mama is just a little girl)

Mama don't know why
Mama's just a little girl
Living if she is or not, oh
Time ain't on her side 

They ask us why we mutilate each other like we do
They wonder why we hold such little worth for human life
(Facing all this drama)
To ask us why we turn from bad to worse is to ignore from which we came
(mama is just a little girl)
You see, you wouldn't ask why the rose that grew from the concrete had damaged petals 
On the contrary, we would all celebrate its tenacity
We would all love its will to reach the sun
Well, we are the roses (we are the roses)
This is the concrete (this is the concrete)
And these are my damaged petals (and these are my damaged petals)
Don't ask me why (Don't ask why)
Thank God, nigga (Thank God)
Ask me how (ask me how)

Kin,"Did you see me fall away?
At what point did fate crumble to the ground?
I thought I found something to last forever.
Holding on with desperate tears,
I was screaming but you could not seem to hear me cry and now, I surrender.

Broken pieces all around

Better think of something fast.
Better off leaving with these last times
So you?ll keep remembering me.
Better take a look at what you had
Better figure out something the next time
When you keep remembering me forever. Remember me forever

Tell me was it good for you?
Cause its what kept me glued to what I knew all along was going in the wrong direction.
I don't think I gave up too early.
I don't think life is long enough to go and waste it all on imperfection

Broken pieces all around

Better think of something fast
Better off leaving with these last times
So you'll keep remembering me
Better take a look at what you had
Better figure out something the next time
When you're still remembering me forever. Remember me forever

Running on empty always
I swim to the surface always
But the truth is always hard to take
In broken pieces

Yo, Step into reality, it's a cold cold world 
You got to learn to accept it, feels like I've been neglected 
All these bands coming out and they sound alright 
All these videos on tv and they look alright 
I spent my whole life spilling my guts between the lines 
Putting in more work than you will ever know than when I rhyme 
Tryin to press the people so I can reach the masses 
Give them what they want with this pen that's plastic (Life)
I got a message I'm a put it in a bottle 
Sign the bottom of the paper and let the whole world swallow 
Today can be tomorrow, ain't no telling when I'm leaving 
I'm a rock this microphone even when I'm barely breathin' 
When you start sleepin, D-loc starts creepin 
When you actin a fool, D-loc's always thinking 
Be clever when you play me because it's comin back to hull 
I can feel my heats rising and it's pissin me off 
And when it's pissin me off I got no choice 
But to crack snap back at you like a chain reaction 
I'm gettin older dog you better watch your mouth 
You better think before you speak on the mic or get knocked out 
It's been a minute and your shit better stop 
Bring your punk ass back to Cali, bitch ass get popped 
You ain't never in Cali, wonder why they don't accept you 
Your sound's getten flopped, plus you got a fuckin attitude 

Life
Life's a constant struggle 

I was never really understood, had a lot of misunderstandings 
Not too many saw my plan, so it left me standing in my own two shoes 
Now what the fuck was I suppose to do? 
Givin a fight, be a man or take my life 
To make ends meet I did more wrongs than rights
Couldn't hold a job, I can't handle being bossed
In and out of rehabs, from border schools I was tossed 
Started hanging with the wrong crowd 
Caught slanging by my pops and got thrown out 
On my own once again I had to make it happen 
That's just a little of my life before I started rappin' 
But I always kept in touch with my dog Dustin 
That's the one friend that I never stopped trusting 
Next thing you know I'm living over at his pad 
Me and him and Saint we was workin for his dad 
Drinkin tallboys after work every night 
Takin hits in the garage out of metal pipes 
Working long ass hours no 9 to 5 
But you gotta do what it takes to survive 
That's around the time that we met Daddy X 
And ever since then we've been on a new quest 
Kottonmouth was formed so it began a new chapter 
Of my life that I'm livin til I'm in the after after

I'm feelin' looser, so tired of tryin' to hold on
It's lookin' crystal clear now

And I hope to get there soon

There's too much to be consumed

I hope that they sedate me
And give me a rest

I don't know if I'll be back home, I kinda like it
I been caught up in life, work too long
I kinda like the idea, I can't even feel here
I can just be

Ignore me if I seem insane 'cause I
I'm so happy life ain't where I am
I'm headed for a world too deep for the to get to
Set myself free

On I keep movin'
But I'm still here in the same old spot

Happiness comes but passes by
I got everything I need
But alone I sit empty inside

'Cause I'm still here, still waiting on you
Right here, another man won't do

I know it's useless, I hear you're okay
Cruel to know that you can move about freely
When I'm still caught up in love's cage

A void of silence grew
An overbearing aching in my heart led me to

And ever since the tie has grown so strong emotions steep
Said, ""I could spend forever in your arms, so can I please?""
The answer unexpected wrung his heart, fell to his knees

Benevolent no less becoming what it's meant to be
But as he passes no long glances she advances meets his face again
Not a smile not a tear no grin its over gone its sinking in

Blue like my heart
I drown inside
So it came that I settled for
This raft in mind
Drift away, away, away down

You never fell I picked you up
I'm waking up early
No one ever feels like they're perfect
But I feel we're perfect here

I've got to speak
My eyes can't keep this secret down and gone away
I'm feeling it shouldn't be long until we both remember why
Why we kept each other around all this time

I sensed you'd come around, boy
And here we stand
It is so strange how we've come so far and nothing's changed

We are what we are
Come so far
To keep me down and gone away

Why we kept each other around all this time

Although it's over
A memory hangs on
A memory

Hush

Our feet gracing mountain tops skipping cross horizons
Silhouetted against against the stars

I've tried so hard I'm searching through layers and trying to make out the words
Delicate designs distracting me from what I'm trying to find
A melody so sweet, from out the the walls it creeps to my ears
Such a sound I have long awaited to hear

We breathe, making little clouds, smiling through the dark and cold
As the wind breaks we shatter to the sky

And I don't expect the dishes to do themselves

My past has caught up to me, and I've lost track
Of what is history and what is a book marked page
I'd always hoped to come back to someday

Chorus:
Don't speak too soon
I'll likely shut my ears or shut down
I'm mostly floating
And I'm not ready to come down

Don't wipe away my tears so quickly
Do you even know if they're happy or sad
Maybe I need to let them fall
Clean me up and wash me out
And let me drown for a while

You don't have to hold my hand through this
You've got enough to carry on your own
I think you'll need both hands for that
I think for now I'd be better off alone

And let it swim away in the water
And please resist the urge to dive under
Let it be it will be better
Let it be it will be better

And walk on my friend walk on
There is no need to linger let it go
And go on my friend go on
And do what you need to
To get you to where you need

There's nothing you can do when you tire
Of things that you one loved but no longer
So please don't hide the tears with your laughter
Let it be it will be better

Release the little bird on your shoulder
It's hard now but its harder when she's older
And please don't change your mind she'll go faster
Let it be it will be better
Let it be it will be better

If you, you will be with me tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight
I, why have I been out wandering through people?

Getting older, lying alone
You would think that I have been lonely
But you have no idea
You cling to me with my forgiving call and I wonder
Why I cannot venture to guess why I'm looking so down on myself
I have been wandering, wandering, and wondering",Wandering and Wondering,2006
Kina Grannis,"Be it broken down or beaten up is what you'll have to offer
And not a moment short of time is like a medicine
They say it heals all wounds are deep and painful, I don't buy it
But I would sell it to you for a decent price

Never would I fall too short of expectations not expected
And never should you take to heart whatever I just said
A little birdie told me something
Really, birds don't talk, but his chirp was nice
I think I gathered what he meant

What's said is not always what is meant
Breathing this fire, leaves me with no desire to be read

Reading books, I've found my eyes, they like to wander off the pages
To play with many things impertinent to my mind
Sometimes I like to sleep, it's cool, but it is overrated
I'd rather just be singing nonsense through the night

What's said is not always what is meant
Breathing this fire, leaves me with no desire to be read

Eighteen years behind me, many more to come, I am excited
I hope I didn't jinx myself, please knock on wood for me
Or write a letter to a friend, tell them it's time to listen
To what I'm saying, but it's not said, don't let it get into your head

Just when you thought that you were sane
Like clever convicts, they came running, escaping from your brain
These words, they trickled out these fickle conversations so concerned
With rationale, I don't know how, but I think I am done for now

What's said is not always what is meant
Breathing this fire, leaves me with no desire to be read",What Is Said,2006
Kina Grannis,"I was down by the water
And I was so scared
So frightend by the crashing waves
You were right there beside me
And you were so prepared, so unafraid
You were laughing in the rain
You always new what you needed
And I was so unsure
It shook the ground
I walked upon
So understandly you stepped away 
To give me a little time to look around
And catch my breath
No I don't wanna walk alone
I wanna walk together with you now...oooooo
Why can't we be eachothers wings
Carrying eachother away from unfortunate things
We were there when it mattered
And that is all we need to carry us away
So why can't we fly?
Why can't we fly away from uncertainty
And why can't we fly
Why can't I? NO
Why can't I know?

Why can't I leave it all behind? No

And I'm thinking it's time that I turn back.
I'm losing myself in my own confusing rhythms
In the path from heart to brain I lack.

Wish the things I felt were clearer
Like the moonlight over me tonight.
You know all I want's to have you nearer
And a love so high that we'd take flight.

Chorus:
So long my ways, I won't miss you
I'll be all right this time.
Follow the lines and dreams can come true.
Just feel my way and shut out the light.

Don't understand how I can know
Just how and why I ought to feel
And then when it comes to feeling that feeling
My head stops it from being real

I wish that I could see right through you
To see just what you see in me
I get so scared someday I'll lose that, lose you
When you look inside and I'm empty

Chorus

Bridge:
But I won't forget
That first time I said those words
Though in my head, I know
It meant something more than this
Find my feelings, save them from the part of me
That confuses everything, when I knew all along
That my heart was never wrong

Some eyes they wander while others are just glued to their feet
And how I wonder what goes on behind those eyes,
There are lives, growing older and they're growing wise

So amazed by all the many different faces,
Searching for traces of emotion wondering places they have been
And on occasion, someone will take a look at me,
But do they see a unique person, or am I part of a vast sea

Chorus:
Sing me your song, solve my mystery
I won't do you no harm, just wanted to see
Sing me your song, solve my mystery
I won't do you no harm, just wanted to see

They might be watching, wondering quite the same of you

A sad song, of how they'd never learn
And they'd never know

The world around him,
Rearrange the mess
Because through his eyes it all was beautiful
But not to all the rest
He had so much to say, he had so much to show
But he kept moving along, singing a song
A sad song, of how he'd never learn
And he'd never know

On a telephone connection spinning miles and miles of wire
You said it was over and I cried and cried
You were gone before I said goodbye

And I don't like to think it is true
The distance came between us like a knife that cut through
When did we go wrong and let it all undo
The only one I ever loved was you

Would you stay just a little my love
Would you just wait just a little my love
Cause the hole in the middle of my heart needs fillin' up
If you stayed just a little that's enough

It kills me as I lay awake at night
Remembering the last kiss that we shared doesn't feel right
Is it impossible for me to win this fight
Keep you a little a longer in my life.

Packed up and ready to go
Heard of some grave sites, out by the highway,
A place where nobody knows
The sound of gunfire, off in the distance,
I'm getting used to it now
Lived in a brownstone, lived in the ghetto,
I've lived all over this town

This ain't no party, this ain't no disco,
This ain't no fooling around
No time for dancing, or lovey dovey,
I ain't got time for that now

Transmit the message, to the receiver,
Hope for an answer some day
I got three passports, a couple of visas,
You don't even know my real name
High on a hillside, the trucks are loading,
Everything's ready to roll
I sleep in the daytime, I work in the nighttime,
I might not ever get home

This ain't no party, this ain't no disco,
This ain't no fooling around
This ain't no Mudd Club, or C. B. G. B.,
I ain't got time for that now
Heard about Houston? Heard about Detroit?
Heard about Pittsburgh, P. A.?
You oughta know not to stand by the window
Somebody might see you up there
I got some groceries, some peanut butter,
To last a couple of days
But I ain't got no speakers, ain't got no
Headphones, ain't got no records to play

Why stay in college? Why go to night school?
Gonna be different this time
Can't write a letter, can't send a postcard,
I can't write nothing at all

This ain't no fooling around

Trouble in transit, got through the roadblock,
We blended with the crowd
We got computer, we're tapping phone lines,
I know that ain't allowed
We dress like students, we dress like housewives,
Or in a suit and a tie
I changed my hairstyle, so many times now,
I don't know what I look like!
You make me shiver, I feel so tender,
We make a pretty good team
Don't get exhausted, I'll do some driving,
You ought to get some sleep
Get you instructions, follow directions,
Then you should change your address
Maybe tomorrow, maybe the next day,
Whatever you think is best

They won't help me survive

When everything is cool (yeah)?

It all went as it should
And you were having the greatest moment in life (yeah)

Here to inherit the rhythm
And when I see it in him I ask myself what more can I give him?
And I would love to but I can't spend every moment with him
It's just those big ole eyes that encourage me to keep living
Hey, ooh when I'm singing I'm sharing
Or rhyming I'm shining my light
And although the love is so blinding I still end up finding my wife
All I can do is reminisce 'cause there eyes no rewinding my life
But the future's so bright that it's almost blinding my sight

Kindred the Family Soul,"Yeah, I gotta admit
It really doesn't seem like it's been this long
But it turned out better than we thought
And they say us proved them wrong
'Cause we have held the promises that we made
The sun - it shines on us
Though people try to throw in shade
But with a son and two daughters later
Seven years deep like Will and Jada
Givin' our praise to the creator
Because I know he's greater than anything
That we could ever do
Ain't none of it would be possible without you

Through love and peace and pain
Yes, we held each other through the pouring rain
We laughed, and we cried; we flied together

So many said we wouldn't make it together
But still we say it's gonna last forever
But everyday we try to make it better
Flyin' over all the stormy weather
You told me you would hold me down
And though I really never show it
I know you love me, and I've always known it
There's nothin' left to prove
There's only one for me
And I'm the one for you

Through love and peace and pain
Yes, we held each other through the pouring rain
We laughed, and we cried; we flied together

Many will come into your life
But one will battle through this life
I found the love of my life, in you
In you
I see the future in your eyes
Stick with me long enough to recognize
Joy laughs and it cries

Through love and peace and pain
Yes, we held each other through the pouring rain
We laughed, we cried, we flied together
Through love and peace and pain
Yes, we held each other through the pouring rain
We laughed, and we cried; we flied together
Through love and peace and pain
Yes, we held each other through the pouring rain
We laughed, and we cried; we flied together",Clap Your Hands (Interlude),2003
Kindred the Family Soul,"Is it a beautiful day? You're beautiful
I mentioned earlier that the world is watching each of you
You make me so proud I'm the happiest woman in the world right now
I have a dream come true

I want you to listen to me now
This is being televised again worldwide today
Just calm yourselves, come on, alright, can you feel me?
Yes, this may be the most important moment in my life
There are words in this song that to me are very special, listen

It's more than you
It's more than me
No matter what we are
We are a family

This dream is for us
This one can be real
They can't stop us now
Because of how we feel

It's more than you
It's more than me
Whatever dreams we have
They're for the family

We're not alone any more then
There are others there
And this dream's big enough
For all of us to share

So don't think you're going
We're not going anywhere
We're staying, taking our share
If you get afraid again, I'll be there

We are a family like a giant tree
Branching out towards the sky
We are a family and so much more
Than just you and I

We are a family like a giant tree
Growing strong, growing wiser
We are, we are a family

Tired of black folk complain that crime don't stop.

Each moment I'm more and more convinced

We ran our own pace

It would be to stay together

Earth stood hard as iron, water like a stone;
Snow had fallen, snow on snow, snow on snow,
In the bleak midwinter, long ago.

Our God, heaven cannot hold Him, nor earth sustain;
Heaven and earth shall flee away when He comes to reign.
In the bleak midwinter a stable place sufficed
The Lord God Almighty, Jesus Christ.

Enough for Him, Whom cherubim, worship night and day,
Breastful of milk, and a mangerful of hay;
Enough for Him, Whom angels fall before,
The ox and ass and camel which adore.

Angels and archangels may have gathered there,
Cherubim and seraphim thronged the air;
But His mother only, in her maiden bliss,
Worshipped the beloved with a kiss.

Hot texas morning
Shades up and take a pee
The weather...
That empty feeling
That comes from way down inside

feeling down again

it's raining
Depression hits me
Mixed up, the sky's all gray
The phone rings
I don't feel like talking
Some things
I can't explain

feeling down again

feeling low, no one home, living life
Feeling cold, growing old in the night

feeling down again

woke up
Hot texas morning
Shades up
Turn on the tv
The weather and that empty feeling
That comes from way down inside

Just wanna hear you say its alright
Its alright

We used to be smooth as silk so how it go wrong?
How we let are love go and loose are tight close bond?
Why we gotta end it on a very sour sour note?
Well I ant ready to give in and just let you go
You always think I'm out cheating when I'm on the road
Even though I always call you after every show
Going way outta my way to let everybody know
That I got a girl at home and that this girl she got my soul
Taking total control over my heart since the start
And now you wanna take my heart and rip it all apart
All because of silly ass rumors and stupid friends
You couldnt have let other people bring you and me to an end
Nah no way that shit just can't happen
I couldnt belive when I came home you was packin
I can't begin to fathem having to go at it alone
I just wanna here your voice even if its on the phone

Its like a never ending battle, I've been rattled, under the weather
You win some you loose some but this ones for ever
I can still remember coming home off of tours
Finding letters on the pillow telling me that your bored
That you can't take no more and you've had enough of me
That you can't even trust me enough to wanna be with me
Its been crazy tryin to make it.
Aw Baby, the only thing I wanna do is prove the point to my lady
Come on baby we've been in it for a miniute puttin in work form the begging and this is how its ending
Were finshed it's sad to say but it's true
You've got to do what you do I've got to do what I do
So keep a smile on your face and everything will be just fine
Remember when I told you that I love your mind
You can see it in your eyes the whole world is yours
I'm gunna miss those eyes that I don't got no more

So why you gotta beat up my face actin dumb
We in a public place with my homies all around
You know I'm only workin for you I'm always down

Doing things different than when I was younger

But I can't lie neither I still wanna tap that

I want to see you more and more

To open up your heart
I won't take so much of your time

Maybe it's wrong to say please love me too
'Cause I know you never do
Somebody else is waitin' there inside for you
Maybe it's wrong to love you more each day
'Cause I know it's here to stay
But I know to whom you should belong

I believe what you said to me

No. Nothing nor no one to find

Jack Frost nipping at your nose
Yule-tide carols being sung by a choir
And folks dressed up like Eskimos.

Everybody knows a turkey and some mistletoe
Help to make the season bright
Tiny tots with their eyes all aglow
Will find it hard to sleep tonight.

They know that Santa's on his way
He's loaded lots of toys and goodies on his sleigh
And every mother's child is gonna spy
To see if reindeer really know how to fly.

Oh! Will you never set me free?
The ties that bound us
Are still around us
There's no escape that I can see
And still those little things remain
That bring me happiness or pain

A cigarette that bears a lipstick's traces
An airline ticket to romantic places
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
A tinkling piano in the next apartment
Those stumbling words that told you what my heart meant
A fair ground's painted swings
These foolish things remind me of you
You came you saw you conquer'd me
When you did that to me
I knew somehow this had to be
The winds of March that make my heart a dancer
A telephone that rings but who's to answer?
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

First daffodils and long excited cables
And candle lights on little corner tables
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
The park at evening when the bell has sounded
The ""Ile de France"" with all the gulls around it
The beauty that is Spring's
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The sigh of midnight trains in empty stations
Silk stockings thrown aside dance invitations
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

Gardenia perfume ling'ring on a pillow
Wild strawb'ries only seven francs a kilo
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
The smile of Garbo and the scent of roses
The waiters whistling as the last bar closes
The song that Crosby sings
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The scent of smould'ring leaves, the wail of steamers
Two lovers on the street who walk like dreamers
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you",These Foolish Things,1997

Big bank, all I do is get bank
Niggas hating on me but they bitch ain't
So conceited, I don't think my shit stank

Come and kick it with a west side nigga
Think I ain't about that action, wanna bet my nigga?
All day thumbing through the check my nigga
Boy you broke, you can't even be a threat my nigga
When you're talking to me say it with your chest little nigga
I pull up on your set and make a mess little nigga
Okay, I got a kilo of gold 36 O's
Wrapped around the neck of a dope boy
Gold yacht, Master Presi' diamond in those
And just paid cash for a Rolls Royce
A true trap nigga, I done sold everything
Trouble Man, Hustle Gang, all gold everything
I said Trouble Man, Hustle Gang, all gold everything

Bought a gold bottle now we on the Dom
Big faced Rollie take up half my arm
Porsche 911 with the Gabby top
All gold scale, that's my magic box

Hit your girl with my chains on so that's gold all on her back
Gold all on my watch, so big it's like a clock
Some people wear fox fur, on the Source cover I wore a fox
This for all the DJ's that got this on replay
See I sell a brick on eBay, then I celebrate
Several bitches in every state
I'm in Miami with Wayne trying to skate, my family straight
Ay your ho 'bout to hyperventilate, I owe her one, we did a 68
I say hoes, my nigga, them ain't red bottoms, her bottom brown
I'm smoking strong, my nigga, I'm on loud, not Bobby Brown
That's souf side up in here, I spell south with a F
F stand for fuck y'all if you ain't fucking with my set
Fuck with me and I'm busting, fuck with me and I'm busting
Every time you see me think about what it would be if I ain't do nothing
Damn right, I'm stunting, damn right, I'm styling
Just got a girl chauffeur and we on a motorcycle and she driving
This Versace, that Versace, this Versace, too
I got killers watching, niggas watching, bitches watching me too
See I'm on lean, on loud, and I got my own lane
You need to mind your own business, it's 2 Chainz and Trinidad (James)

Fuck probation, if a nigga try to play me I'ma bust him
Don't need no security, reaching for my jewelry
Get you niggas popped quick, filled full of hot shit
Fresh out the box Tip hot than a drop 6
Made a quarter mil' in the penn givin' stock tips
Haters want to stop Tip, mad 'cus they not Tip
Ball every summer so your baby mama jock Tip
You don't no drama pimp, I promise I do not slip
Chrome 4-5th, hid well if the cops trip
Bought my girl a Hummer with the chrome right in front of that

Advances on the throne, I ain't never take it lightly
But all that tongue-wrestlin' hatin' while I'm gone don't excite me
How many rappers you know that could hold they own on White street
East steady talkin' on the cell phone nightly
Normal population, half the jail just like me
Polices think I'm crazy, scared a nigga gon' strike me
Contrarily, a nigga tryin' me is unlikely
They barkin' don't bother me, I'll be bombin' 'for they bite me
They just shocked to see my rap's exactly how my life be
Shiesty, with a conversation quite pricey
My fist so rocky and and wrist so icey
Might be, thrown off my rocker just slightly
Fiesty, claimin' hot temper don't ignite me
I'm only gonna ask ya find the exit once politely

My plan is to keep you at least two, levels under me where I need you
I'ma take advantage of my chance to defeat you
Your true colors done shown, now it's on when I see you
I'm grown nigga, so let it be know we ain't equal
You sadly mistaken if you thinkin' I can't reach you
Beat you, to a fuckin' pulp if I need to
The very spot ya standin' in then is where I'll leave you
Seen on the scene white tees and the v-suits
O.G. status, don't beef unless I need to
Sissy you way outa line and you runnin' outa time
Hang behind closed do's when ya heard I got some time

Psycho, nuts so, what I give a fuck for?
All I know now is to get out and go for the gusto
So, fuck niggas fuck hoes, he said, she said, nigga and what so?
Fuck what they say bout my cases, fuck what they say bout my lady
Fuck what they say we were doing on that day of visitation
All I care 'bout is my out date and this nature of probation
How much dough I'm set to make and where I'm gon' go on vacation
Wait, damn, okay that's way too far ahead of me
So I'm just tryna take it day to day if they would let a G, breath
