Prince,"Uh-oh here she come
She got them gold hot pants on again
Yeah man
I want to talk, but I dunno

She's a peach

She was dark, she was tan
She made me glad to be a man
She was young, she was smart
Just one glance and she stole my heart
The kinda girl you wanna teach 

She's a peach

Summertime, feelin' fine, getting wild
All that's on my mind
Here she come, dressed in red
Get her done, is all that's in my head
Her hot pants can't hide her cheeks

She's a peach

She was pure, every ounce
I was sure, when her titties bounced
Every way, she's a winner
Turn a gay preacher to a sinner
No one you want your mama meet

She's a peach

I would die if I kissed her
I would try, but I'm last on her list
She's so cool and I'm so ugly
I'd be a fool, to think she could love me
This kinda girl's always out of reach

She's a peach

Fuck with that",Peach,1993
Prince,"I was dreamin' when I wrote this
Forgive me if it goes astray
But when I woke up this mornin'
Could of sworn it was judgment day

The sky was all purple
There were people runnin' everywhere
Tryin' to run from the destruction
You know I didn't even care

'Cause they say two thousand zero zero
Party over, oops out of time
So tonight I'm gonna party like it's 1999

I was dreamin' when I wrote this
So sue me if I go to fast
But life is just a party
And parties weren't meant to last

War is all around us
My mind says prepare to fight
So if I gotta die
I'm gonna listen to my body tonight

Yeah, they say two thousand zero zero
Party over, oops out of time
So tonight I'm gonna party like it's 1999
Yeah, yeah

Lemme tell ya somethin'
If you didn't come to party
Don't bother knockin' on my door
I got a lion in my pocket
And baby he's ready to roar, yeah yeah

Everybody's got a bomb
We could all die here today, uhh
But before I'll let that happen
I'll dance my life away

They say two thousand zero zero
Party over, oops out of time
We're runnin' outta time
So tonight, we gonna, we gonna (tonight I'm gonna party like it's 1999)

Prince,"All seven and we'll watch them fall
They stand in the way of love
And we will smoke them all
With an intellect and a savior-faire

And together we'll love through all
Space and time, so don't cry

And I saw an angel come down unto me
In her hand she holds the very key
Words of compassion, words of peace
And in the distance an army's marching feet (one, two, three, four, one, two, three, four)
But behold, we will watch them fall

And we lay down on the sand of the sea
And before us animosity will stand and decree
That we speak not of love only blasphemy
And in the distance, six others will curse me
But that's alright (that's alright)
For I will watch them fall (one, two, three, four, five, six, seven)

All seven and we'll watch them fall
They stand in the way of love
And we will smoke them all
With an intellect and a savoir-faire

I am yours now and you are mine
And together we'll love through all
Space and time, so don't cry
One day all seven will die

(Just how old)

And we will see a plague and a river of blood
And every evil soul will surely die in spite of
And seven tears, but do not fear
Four in the distance, twelve souls from now
You and me will still be here  we will still be here

There will be a new city with streets of gold
The young so educated they never grow old
And a, there will be no death four with every breath
A voice of many colors sings a song
That's so bold
Sing it while we watch them fall

All seven and we'll watch them fall
They stand in the way of love
And we will smoke them all
With an intellect and a savoir-faire
No one in the whole universe
Will ever compare

When her old man ran away
She couldn't stop crying

It was ten thirty-five on a lonely Friday night

She was lookin' alright, yeah

And she said all she wanted was a good man
And wanted to know
If I thought I was qualified, yeah

And I said, baby don't waste your time

With tears in her eyes (tears in her eyes)

Prince,"Dearly beloved
We are gathered here today
To get through this thing called life

Electric word life
It means forever and that's a mighty long time
But I'm here to tell you
There's something else
The after world

A world of never ending happiness
You can always see the sun, day or night

So when you call up that shrink in Beverly Hills
You know the one, Dr. Everything'll Be Alright
Instead of asking him how much of your time is left
Ask him how much of your mind, baby

'Cause in this life
Things are much harder than in the after world
In this life
You're on your own

And if the elevator tries to bring you down
Go crazy, punch a higher floor

If you don't like the world you're living in
Take a look around you
At least you got friends

You see I called my old lady
For a friendly word
She picked up the phone
Dropped it on the floor
(Ah, ah) is all I heard

Are we gonna let the elevator
Bring us down
Oh, no let's go!

Let's go crazy
Let's get nuts
Let's look for the purple banana
'Til they put us in the truck, let's go!

We're all excited
But we don't know why
Maybe it's 'cause
We're all gonna die

And when we do (When we do)
What's it all for (What's it all for)
You better live now
Before the grim reaper come knocking on your door

Tell me, are we gonna let the elevator bring us down
Oh, no let's go!

Let's go crazy
Let's get nuts
Look for the purple banana
'Til they put us in the truck, let's go!

C'mon baby
Let's get nuts
Yeah
Crazy

Let's go crazy

Are we gonna let the elevator bring us down
Oh, no let's go!
Go crazy

I said let's go crazy (Go crazy)
Let's go, let's go
Go
Let's go

Dr. Everything'll be alright
Will make everything go wrong
Pills and thrills and daffodils will kill
Hang tough children

He's coming
He's coming
Coming

Take me away!",Let's Go Crazy,1993

I can put my arms around every boy I see, oh yeah
But they only remind me of you

All my dames remind me of you too girl, oh yeah

I went to the doctor, guess what he told me
What'd he tell you? 

Guess what he told me
I'm listening

You want to tell me why?

Nothing compares (no), nothing compares to you

Hu, hu, tenor man, play it for me

A tisket, a tasket, no lunch in her basket
Just school books for the fight she would be in
One day over this hoodie
She got beat for some clothes and her rep
With her chin up, she scolded ""All y'all's molded
When I'm rich, on your neck I will step""
And step she did to the straight A's
Then college, the master degree
She hired the heifers that jumped her
And made everyone of them work for free?
No! Why?
So what if my sisters are triflin'?

And this fool named Trick wanna stick her
Uh, talkin' more Schick than a Bic
'Bout how he gonna make Pussy a star
If she come and sing a lick on his hit
Pussy said ""Nigga, you crazy if you don't know
Every woman in the world ain't a freak
You can go platinum four times 
Still couldn't make what I make in a week

She was rollin' four-deep
3 sisters and a weepy-eyed white girl drivin' her haul
I pulled up right beside her
And my electric top went down
I said ""Motherfucker, I know your reputation
And I'm astounded that you're here
I fear you're lonely and you want to know
A twelve o'clock straight up nigga
That don't give a shit that you're Pussy Control
Well I'm that nigga, at least I wanna be
But it's gonna be hard as hell
To keep my mind off a body
That would make every rich man
Want to sell, sell, sell (seventy five, we need another, eighty five, eighty five here, sold!)
Can I tell you what I'm thinkin' that you already know?
You need a motherfucker that respects your name""
Now say it, Pussy Control (Are you ready?)

Pussy Control, oh
Pussy Control, oh

And the moral of this motherfucker is
Ladies, make'em act like they know
You are, was, and always will be Pussy Control (Are you ready?)
Peace and be wild (Aaah, Pussy Control)

Say what, huh? (Oh)
Oh no, don't you think about callin' her a ho (Are you ready?)

And not a crime

Prince,"Let's go down to the holy river
If we drown then we'll be delivered
You can still see the picture upon the wall
One eye staring at nothing at all
The other one trying to focus through all your tears
You can try and try but there's nothing to hide
You can't run from yourself and what's inside
You got to find the answers to the questions that you most fear

So over and over you ask your soul
Why did you come down to a world so cold?
And the voice inside says tonight the truth will be told

You surrounded yourself with all the wrong faces
Spending your time in all the wrong places
Putting your faith in things that only make you cry
People say they love you when they want to help
But how can they when you can't help yourself?
The more they say they love you, the more you just want to die
So here we go again, the self analysis
Have another glass of Port and uh, forget this
The band's playing at the club tonight and they're bound to groove

There you are, you think you're high
You can't ask yourself 'cause you'd only lie
If you had a dollar for every time you tried

You can't call nobody cause they'll tell you straight up
Come and make love when you really hate 'em
Relationships based on the physical are over and done
They're over and done (They're over and done)
You'd rather have fun
With only one, with only one
Only one, one (one)

And then it hit you like a fist on a wall
Who gave you life when there was none at all?
Who gave the sun permission to rise up everyday? (Ooh, oh yes)
Let me tell it (Go on)
If you ask God to love you longer
Every breath you take will make you stronger
Keeping you happy (happy) and proud to call His name (Go on and say it)
Jesus (Jesus)

And over and over you ask your soul
Why did you come down to a world so cold?
And the voice inside said tonight the truth will be told
And this time I was listening, hear me

Let's go down to the holy river
If we drown then we'll be delivered (Yes we will)
If we don't then we'll never see the light (No)
If you die before you try
You'll have to come back and face the light (Oh yes)
When you believe it, you got a good reason to cry (Oh my, my)

So I went on down to the holy river
I called my girl and told her I had something to give her
I asked her to marry me and she said yes, I cried
Oh, that night I drowned in her tears and mine
And.. and instead of a glass of sorrow and wine
Looking back y'all, I don't miss nothing except the time
And when I see that picture upon the wall
The one eye staring at nothing at all
My eyes trying to focus but these are much different tears
Oh, yes they are

It's late and I think it's about time for you and me to get closer,
To get closer than we ever did before (oh)
Whenever there's a tide you can let it ride inside your interior
Lay back, relax upon my shore (oh)
Oh-oh baby, I want to make love to you right here
One inside the other one, no fear, we're here until

The sun, the moon and stars
Don't seem as far as they did yesterday
The sun, the moon and stars
In love we are, forever, always

Blow out this candle sunlight
And come lay down next to me
And paint another rainbow, oh-wee (oh-wee)
Eclipse this light with ecstasy

Come on, come on
Let's lay down
I'm walking out of what to say 
That kind of lucky rhyme
Make a chippy want to say:
Whisper in the belly
To me rocking rose
Do you like I do
Come on and dance the night away 
Let's lay before they get to close the door
You and me, we got to get down on the floor
Come on, let the tide ride in and off the shore
I want to love you once again, and then some more
Lay your head back I got my hand behind your head
Like you do the limbo supple on the bouncy bed
Let's bouncing on the summer spring
And when you start to fall
You come like a cold winter due in Montreal

(Come on baby)

You really ought to know
For every thing you taught her
Don't matter when she's all alone

My crazy friend named Cara
After all of us told her, ?No?
S-s-she'd get another spoon ball
Now, she's going no where slow

Her papa caught her for the first time
And put her out on the street
Cara told me to remind him
That she was only seventeen

Yo, mister how's your daughter? how's your girl?
You really ought to know
Every thing you taught her
It don't matter when she's all alone

Cara got hooked up with the wrong kids
Then s-s-she started skipping school
Then Cara got high to make disappear
A world full of fools

In her eyes her father was the biggest fool of them all
And she was speeding, that's what she?d say
Maybe, maybe, maybe she wouldn't talk so stupid
If she knew how much she needed this fool today

Yo, mister how's your daughter?
You really ought to know
For every thing you taught her
Don't matter when she's all alone

She needs you right now mister
?Cause she ain't got long to live
It?s so easy to say, ?I love you?
But it?s harder to forgive

Her father cried when I told him that Cara twice got knocked up
He said, ?Just like her mama, aha, she shows her body
When she wants to show love, she tried that stuff with me
And I beat her down, there's no way I could let her stay
Couldn't let her stick around ?

?Cause I tried so hard to raise her right
He said, ?What made her turn out this way?, I don't know
What made her turn out this way, I don't know, I don't know
And I said and I said and I said

Yo, mister how's your daughter?
You really ought to know, every thing
Every thing you taught her
Don't matter when she's all alone

But she needs you right now mister
She ain't got long to live
It?s easy to say, ?I love you?

It let me know I'd never seen the moon before
(Never seen the moon before)
So many speak of the moon as though it had no flaws
But to compare it to a beauty like yours would give one pause
Nothing about you is false, that's why your love is real
(Talking 'bout real) that's why your love is real
God forbid if you belonged to another, I'd have to steal you (take you from your man)
I might be tempted to break the law (break the law 'round here) 
Because your beauty, it gives one pause (yes, it does)
It slows me down

Would buy me a big house in the 'hood

And you're so vain you'd think that you're the 1 behind this song 
Sure you know he got plenty lyrics, yeah, up his sleeve 
And after he got what he want he just go up and leave 
And Sunday chocolate on the roof right after his game 
He like the Lakers but the Sixers on when he came

Waiting on that fool to purchase what you'd been dying for? 
And before I see you drop a spill I have to bring you down 
Now you got that chocolate barracuda hangin' round 
Hangin' round your neck like a cheap gold chain 
He don't deserve to say that he ever knew you're name 
Much less he get to smell the perfume I gave you

From the dust of the earth and the knowledge tree

My heart's been crying out to sing this song
I don't care who knows it
Cause there's nothing wrong

I'm so scared of losing you
I really don't know what I'd do
Can't bear the thought of another day apart
My heart, my heart, corazon

Once when I first laid eyes on you
I saw heaven and earth anew
Everyone else saw my brown eyes no longer blue

How much you changed me in every way
I just wanna thank you

Gonna be so much fun three one two one

Prince,"Wake up
You're beautiful, loved and blessed
Feel me? (I think I do)

When you found me I was just a piece of clay
I was formless, you gave me a new name
With the breath of life I now live abundantly
All I needed was the potter's hand
And the blood on Calvary (that's right)

But to much power (tell it)
Can can sometimes turn to shame
To much desire
Sometimes makes you feel the same (come on)
But forgiveness is how you win the game
I begged for truth, now I know the truth
And that is when you came and said I was

Beautiful, loved and blessed
I'm better than the day before
Cause you made me confess that I am,
Beautiful, loved and blessed
When you're free you're really free indeed
All you gotta do is just plant the seed

A constant battle to stay ahead of the game
Is anybody famous when everybody wants fame?
Always trying to break you down
Thinkin' that'll raise 'em up
I just wanna be	 happy
Come take this bitter cup from me

If I were ever to write my life story
I could truly say through all the pain and glory
I was just a piece of clay in need of the potter's hand
Cause when you whispered in my ear
The words I so now understand, oh

Beautiful, loved and blessed
I'm better than the day before
Cause you made me confess that I am,
Beautiful, loved and blessed
When you're free you're really free indeed
All you gotta do is just plant the seed

Everything you made you said, ""That's good""
Before the fall of man you said, ""That's good""
Every time I walk in faith, that's good
You let me see another day, that's good
Before the earth was made you said,
""Tamar, I will lead the way and you'll go far""
Knowledge and understanding
Understanding is good
And when I wake up in the morning
All I hear in my hood is people saying that they're

Beautiful, loved and blessed
When you rescue me from the darkness
And our heart just must confess
Beautiful, loved and blessed
When you're free you're free indeed
All you gotta do is just plant the seed

Hey, hey, hey
Wake up it's a new day
Hey, hey, hey
Wave you're hands in the air and say
Hey, hey, hey
Wake up it's a new day
Hey, hey, hey
Wave you're hands in the air and say

Beautiful, loved and blessed
You rescued me from the darkness in the wilderness
But I am beautiful, loved and blessed
No matter what the challenge
I always pass the test

That's what I am, beautiful
That's what I am, beautiful
I don't mean to put nobody down
Still I must confess that I am
Beautiful, that's what I am
That's what I am
When you wanna give up, don't cause you know
You always got a friend

I wanna smother you with something shiny as the rims upon my ride
I want to look for the milky way and when I find it 
I'm gonna make you scream my name as if it was divine (Prince)

Give props to you're mama for the healthy food she must have gave ya

I'm the one, the one, the one you wanna see

Look around you baby
You know you've seen it all before
Every nickel in this club lookin' for a dime
Nothing less nothing more

Too tall to be talked down to
To over it to be put under
Any spell a blind fisherman could cast
That's why I came like thunder to tell you

[Chorus]

You don't need to fix your hair
For somebody you don't care for
You don't need to shave your legs
If it ain't me that's knocking at your door
I know you ain't a concubine
I know you ain't a one night stand
I don't wanna waste your time
If you wanna get creamy
I'm the one you wanna see

Oh the one you wanna see baby
Oh the one you wanna see
I'm the one you wanna see

Prince,"Imagine holding Planet Earth
In the palm of your hand
With no regard for your place of birth
Or claim to any land

The only thing between us now is the truth we understand
If Planet Earth was in the palm of your hand

Fifty years from now what will they say about us here?
Did we care for the water and the fragile atmosphere?

There are only two kinds of folk
And the difference they make
The ones that give
And the ones that take

[Chorus:]
Just like the countless bodies
That revolve around the Sun
Planet Earth must now come into balance with the one
That caused it all to be
Then we'll see His kingdom come
So shall it be written, so shall it be sung

Imagine you could rid the Earth
Of anyone you choose
Which ones would you need the most
And which ones would you lose?

Do we want to judge another
Lest we be judged too?
Careful now
The next one might be you

[Chorus]

Imagine sending your first born
Off to fight a war
With no good reason how it started and what they are fighting for
And if they're blessed to make it home
Will they still be poor?

Pray for peace right now and forever more

[Chorus x2]",Planet Earth,2007
Prince,"The main problem with war
Is that nobody ever wins
The next generation grows up
And learns how to do it all over again

No matter who started the argument
Just matters how each one ends
How many people really want resolution?

The main problem with people
Is they never do what they say (They say)
One minute they want peace (Want peace)
Then do everything to make it go away

Dropping bombs on each other
In the act of saving face
Tell me now people how is that resolution?

[Chorus:]
Either you do or you don't
Either you will or you won't
Making amends (Make amends)
Is a difficult pill to swallow

What can we lose if we try?
With no water, a flower dies
With no one to lead resolution will follow

Resolution

Love is like a circle
No beginning and no end
A broken heart will mend
If you love it like your best friend

Handle your heart with care
It's as delicate as a wing
When the storms come again
Pray for resolution

Either you will or you won't (Either you will or you won't)
Either you do or you don't

Will you want resolution? (Either you do or you don't)

I'm all alone

Close my eyes Erotica, I'm seein' you
Listen to me wishin' I could be with you
To share my love and ecstasy with you

Are you alone? Is your shorty asleep?
Hold on, that's okay, ignore the beep
For you, my love is immortal deep
You are my queen but I can't ignore the freak

Let's let our bodies talk and our auras speak
Hold on, gotta get the toiletries
As our waters reach distances unheard of
I'm in the room nestled sweet and I observe love

Only for you, I ask God to show me the truth
What he showed me was you
Wherever I go, my soul leads to you
Days gone, nights lonely for you

Erotica, wet dreams are on my mind
Erotica, can I come in your mind?
Erotica, oh yes, with love I shine
Erotica, wish on star *69, Erotica, wish on star *69
Erotica, wish on star *69, Erotica

So much I wish you were here with me now
My bad, I just hit redial
I want you to come and never leave now
Is your mind and your right hand free now?

Our love reach deep down inside of it
As the candle burns, where desire's lit
Makin' love knows no distance or environment
When we ah, feel the most high in it

I feel you touchin' me and I begin to rise from it
Your love is stuck in me, our minds are so alive and thick
Picture my hands on your waist as I stare in your face
Your mouth half open, your love I can taste

Embracin' you, life, I let go
Gotta switch phones 'cause this one is ghetto
Another level of love we create when we take it to
And when it's made, Erotica, it's made for you

Erotica, wet dreams are on my mind
Erotica, can I come in your mind?
Erotica, oh yes, with love I shine

Slave to your loneliness
(Slave to your loneliness)
Inside of loneliness
(Inside this, alt we bear)

With love of loneliness
(With thoughts of loneliness)
Enslaved by loneliness

I want you to come inside your mind
And find a place nasty and kind
This is where our desires grind
And where they peak Is most divine

A place and time, I hope we reach together
You are my queen and freak forever
I feel you inside my stomach
My body shakes

Wet dreams are on my mind, Erotica
Can I come in your mind? Erotica
Oh yes, with love I shine, Erotica

Turned up the stereo
About to raise the dead

Walked in the closet

Then I check my email

Change the names to protect the guilty

Should I bring somebody
Or dance alone?

Prince,"I was born, raised on a slave plantation
In the United States, of the red, white and blue
Never knew that I was different, till Dr. King was on a balcony
Lyin' in a bloody pool
I expected so much more from a loving
A loving, loving society
A truthful explanation, you know what
I got another, another conspiracy

If it was just a dream, listen, call me, call me a dreamer too

With more rewards and accolades, then anyone before or after
21st century, oh what a shame, what a shame
Race, race still matters
A race to what, and where we going
We in the same boat, but I'm the only one rowing

Last time I checked, you were sleeping, but you can call me a dreamer too
(What's up with this)

Peanut butter logic, served on a bed of lies
Don't go down too easy, when you've seen your father cry
Have you ever clutched the steering wheel in your car too tight
Praying that police sirens just pass you by that night
While the helicopter circles us, this theory's getting deep
Think they're spraying chemicals over the city
While we sleep

Come on, I'm staying awake
you can call me a dreamer too

I'm about to die but I don't wanna stop
I breathe in his sweet love satisfied
Then we kiss and it's so divine

He takes my soul, body and mind
He takes what he wants, and that's just fine

Tapped on the crag

And brought forth the water
That quenched your thirst

Feel better, feel good, feel wonderful

If you think about how much time it took
For you to try to get a page in my book
I feel so good right now
I just can't recall
What the (?) I was thinking when I
Threw you the ball

It hit three bystanders after you touched it
Now they wanna sue me but they love me to much
'Cuz they know I wish them heaven and all of its gold
Same to you, come on let's groove

Prince,"I awoke to sirens, but all you heard was apologies. 
Was it too loud or not loud enough 
To move the mountains we built 
To the trenches we dug?
Repeating ourselves, 
Biting our own hands- counting how many fingers fit? 
How many fingers?

Sit and wait.

You make this look good, 
You make it look so good, 
Dressed up in riot gear for a prat fall good for profit. 
We claimed the product in the name of tragedy, 
Were so dramatic. 
Now I'm after pyramids, 
What would you rig that with plastic explosives and trip wire? 
And if we lost our arms, 
And lost our voice 
Could we trick ourselves- 
That we killed ourselves.

The apple of my daddy's eye

He looked at me and just said hi

Was it his cologne or the style of his hair

Sometimes I'm all alone and don't c him
I wish it was different but I don't care

Guilty of so many crimes

Prince,"Before you have any interaction
With members of the opposite sex
We're going to have to debrief you thoroughly
Over the course of the next few sessions

Today though we'll just start off with some simple affirmations
That will be automatically induced into your memory temple
Which you can upload onto a hard drive
And review at your desire

Affirmation number I
There are no such words as me or mine

Words of this nature were introduced into society
As a control mechanism
Which systematically divided the subjects first individually
And then as a collective

From now on
Any person or object whatsoever that requires your attention
Is something that has veered from its path and preordained destiny
Of total enlightenment",Affirmation I & II,2014
Prince,"How are you feeling today Mr Nelson?

I trust you're having a quick and enjoyable adjustment period
As you can see, we are communicating now telepathically

Which makes things move so much faster here
After you've completed the planned affirmation therapy
You will find this way of interaction far easier

Until I, I find my, my way back home, home

You've probably felt for many years in you're former life
That you were separate from not only others, but even yourself
Now you can see that was never the case

First one intoxicated, last one to leave

Give me back the time, you can keep the memories

Keep breaking me down, down, down

Is met with another demand to kneel
And reprimand concealed allegations of you sinning

My mission, so they said, was just to drop the bombs
(Acceleration into temporal space continuum now begins)
Just like I got no conscience
Just like I got no qualms (Alpha Seven, acknowledge)
Now what does that mean?

Go, Tommy go, go, Tommy, go
Go, Tommy go, go, Tommy, go
Go, Tommy go, go, Tommy, go
Go, Tommy go, go, Tommy, go

So here, my target is approaching
The angel on my shoulder starts coaching

Live for love, without love you don't live

Boom, I take a deep breath
Is it boom, life, is it boom, death?

Live for love

Maybe I was better off staying in school (live for love)
But everybody said flying planes was cool (live for love)
It's so easy for them to say, 'cause they never have to go through

How can I live for love?

I'm calling! (live for love)
Aah, I'm coming! (live for love)

Damn, I got hit, but I still complete the mission (live for love)
I flash upon my whole life just-a-steady wishin' (live for love)
The choice you make is vital, so end of my recital
I say, you got to live for love (live for love)

Live for love, without love you don't live
And how you make it is based on what you're givin' back
In fact, only a few of us slip through the cracks
Through generations
The cards have always been stacked against us (live for love)
To love each other is a must
If we just trust and cut the fuss
Believe me, unity is a must
Listen everybody, as I spread the word
Everything is hazy when your vision's blurred
I'm kickin' reality in the streets of the city
There's this mentality what goes around comes around
And 'gangking' any clown who ain't down
With the colors that you're sportin' 'round
Listen G, you are supposed to be
Strivin' to be the best that you can be
So stop tryin' to dominate and push and shove (live for love)
Come on y'all
We got to live for love (live for love)

Prince & the New Power Generation,"One more card and it's twenty two
Unlucky for him again
He never had respect for money it's true
That's why he never wins
That's why he never ever has enough
To treat his lady right
He just pushes her away in a huff
And says 'Money don't matter to night'

Money don't matter to night
It sure didn't matter yesterday
Just when you think you've got more than enough
That's when it all up and flies away
That's when you find out that you're better off
Makin' sure your soul's alright
'Cause money didn't matter yesterday,
And it sure don't matter to night

They're tellin' him he just can't lose
So he goes off and tries to find a partner
But all he finds are users (users)
All he finds are snakes in ever color
Every nationality and size
Seems like the only thing he can do
Is just roll his eyes, and say that

Money don't matter to night (don't matter)
It sure didn't matter yesterday
Just when you think you've got more than enough

And it sure don't matter to night

(ooh-wee-ooh, don't matter)
(it don't matter to night, no)

Hey now, maybe we can find a good reason
To send a child off to war
So what if we're controllin' all the oil,
Is it worth a child dying for? (is it worth it?)
If long life is what we all live for
Then long life will come to pass
Anything is better than the picture of the child
In a cloud of gas
And you think you got it bad

Money don't matter to night (no, don't matter)
It sure didn't matter yesterday (yesterday)
Just when you think you've got more than enough
That's when it all up and flies away (flies away, flies away)

But behold, we will watch them fall

And we lay down on the sand of the sea
And before us animosity will stand and decree
That we speak not of love only blasphemy

To love each other is a must
If we just trust and cut the fuss
Believe me, unity is a must
Listen everybody, as I spread the word
Everything is hazy when your vision's blurred
I'm kickin' reality in the streets of the city
There's this mentality what goes around comes around
And 'gangking' any clown who ain't down
With the colors that you're sportin' 'round
Listen G, you are supposed to be
Strivin' to be the best that you can be
So stop tryin' to dominate and push and shove (live for love)

The everlasting one
The one who came from nothing

She gives birth to the Son of Man

The sin of one and all

These two words, a little bit behind the beat.
I mean just enough o-turn you on.
For every time she said the words another one of his doubts were gone.

Should he try to rap with her? Should he stand and stare?
No one else was watching her, she didn't seem to care.

We are gathered here today
To get through this thing called life

Electric word life
It means forever and that's a mighty long time
But I'm here to tell you
There's something else
The after world

A world of never ending happiness
You can always see the sun, day or night

So when you call up that shrink in Beverly Hills
You know the one, Dr. Everything'll Be Alright
Instead of asking him how much of your time is left
Ask him how much of your mind, baby

'Cause in this life
Things are much harder than in the after world
In this life
You're on your own

And if the elevator tries to bring you down
Go crazy, punch a higher floor

If you don't like the world you're living in
Take a look around you
At least you got friends

You see I called my old lady
For a friendly word
She picked up the phone
Dropped it on the floor
(Ah, ah) is all I heard

Are we gonna let the elevator
Bring us down
Oh, no let's go!

Let's go crazy
Let's get nuts
Let's look for the purple banana
'Til they put us in the truck, let's go!

We're all excited
But we don't know why
Maybe it's 'cause
We're all gonna die

And when we do (When we do)
What's it all for (What's it all for)
You better live now
Before the grim reaper come knocking on your door

Tell me, are we gonna let the elevator bring us down
Oh, no let's go!

'Til they put us in the truck, let's go!

Are we gonna let the elevator bring us down

You meet a child that drives you wild
With unmistakable
Down-town, style

Her winter coat and sexy tokes
On camel smokes
Don't prepare you
For a laugh that explodes

A princess and a mistress
Dressed in Sunday best
To impress a fresh love, interest

To set the stage
Receive her praise
And leave a sour taste
That only gets sweeter as it fades

She just can't help being a girl
She just can't help being a girl
She just can't help herself
Full of spectacle and charm like nothing else
Being a girl

At the initial glance
She's making plans to build her a man
Like a T-4 or an airplane
The girl wants a model romance

Fell in love
While taming her new adventurer
'Cause every rebel
Needs a woman's touch
(Woman's touch)

The fact is she's an actress
Using the bedroom for practice
Making him think
His kiss is all she ever imagines

With a pocketful of rocket fuel
Dragging strings that pull
On a heart, that's uncertain
But beautiful

She just can't help being a girl
She just can't help being a girl
She just can't help herself
Full of spectacle and charm like nothing else

Prince Buster,"The Ten Commandments from man given to woman
Through the inspiration of I, Prince Buster
One, thou shall have no other man but me
Two, thou shall not encourage no man to make love to you
Neither kiss nor caress you
For I am your man, a very jealous man
And is ready to lay low any other man that may intrude in our love

Three, remember to kiss and caress me
Honor and obey me, in my every whim and fancy
Seven days a week and twice on Sundays
Because at no time will I ever be tired of I-T, it

Honor my name so that every other woman may honor it also
Five, thou shall not provoke me to anger
Or my wrath will descend upon you heavily
Commandment Six, thou shall not search my pockets at night
Or annoy me with your hearsays

Commandment Seven, thou shall not shout my name in the streets
If I'm walking with another woman
But wait intelligently until I come home
Then we both can have it out decently
For I am your man, a funny man
And detest a scandal in public places

Commandment Eight, thou shall not drink, nor smoke
Nor use profane language
For those bad habits I will not stand for
Nine, thou shall not commit adultery
For the world will not hold me guilty if I commit
Murder

Ten, thou shall not covet thy neighbor's dress
Nor her shoes, nor her bureau, nor her bed, nor her hat
Nor anything that's hers
Neither shall thou call my attention to anything that may be for sale
In any stores, for I will not give thee anything but what
You actually need for your purpose

Those are the Ten Commandments given from man to woman

But I keep a loud tool 
Play games you'll be shitting in a pouch fool 
Got stock like Dow do

Off the car lot 
Hit the gas tires smoke like cigar shops 
Make ya jaw drop 
Bought it off the narc cops 
Tax on the work we got them H and R blocks 
Alumni yeah I'm from the school of hard knocks 
Looking out for the twelve Roger Staubach 
No cafe but we had them hard rocks 
For the bread they'll throw you off of dark docks 
So before ya heart stop 
Or the narcs knock 
I gotta give it to you straight like a bar shot 
Cuz the streets don't play fair 
Niggas mad cuz you got more rides than the state fair

And hope that you can live or float 
Independently self made 
And well paid 
Three whips one chain no welt pain 
When you treeing over niggas they gon yell shade 
They outta patience where I live cuz they sell weight 
Avoided the temptation of crack slinging 
But Lincoln park had it looking like back in the eighties 
Now partners getting broads and the hottest whips 
And I was sweating hours trying to get the illest scholarship 
Ain't have a pot to piss 
I wasn't born rich 
When I be writing I'm as hungry as a model bitch 
She got the fattest ass they got the hottest look 
Leaving wit eight bitches I need some octopus 
See how wale go j four cs 
My lake shore whore never be on the bs 
Bullshit chi town 
Riding around 
Top down 
Hanging with the squares will be the reason niggas not around 
What it do 
Penny phones all blue 
Or you could prolly use a nigga drive welcome to my car pool 
Yellow lam g shit 
She double od shit 
Five time foul niggas need to stop reaching

High as fuck with my down ass 
Bitch roll to the Porsche from the bus pass 
But got lost when me and the cash crossed paths 
Indo smoke out my nose no mustache 
Bitches I want but that money is a must have 
Fuck is you drunk? 
Pay that up front 
Like the Ferrari trunk 
Be careful you won't 
Have to be sorry hon 
Stay close to the G's and you might learn sum'n 
Might earn sum'n 
Chop it up like mobsters on the rooftop let you burn sum'n 
Stop talking so much 
Soak it up next time you have sum'n to say

Talking bout you on yo way

Prince Far I,"During the North African campaign, a bunch of soldier boys had
Been on a long hike and they arrived in a little town called Casino. The
Next morning being Sunday, several of the boys went to Church. A sergeant
Commanded the boys in Church and after the Chaplain had read the prayer
The text was taken up next. Those of the boys who had a prayer book took
Them out, but this one boy had only a deck of cards, and so he spread
Them out. The Sergeant saw the cards and said, ""Soldier, put away those
Cards."" After the services was over, the soldier was taken prisoner and
Brought before the Provost Marshall

The Marshall said, ""Sergeant, why have you brought this man
Here?"" ""For playing cards in church, Sir."" ""And what have you to say for
Yourself, son?"" ""Much, Sir,"" replied the soldier. The Marshall said, ""I
Hope so, for if not I shall punish you more than any man was ever
Punished."" The soldier said, ""Sir, I have been on the march for about six
Days. I have neither a Bible nor a prayer book, but I hope to satisfy
You, Sir, with the purity of my intentions."" And with that, the boy
Started his story:

""You see Sir, when I look at the Ace, it reminds me that there
Is but one God. And the Deuce reminds me that the Bible is divided into
Two parts, the Old and the New Testaments. When I see the Trey, I think
Of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost. And when I see the Four, I
Think of the four Evangelists who preached the Gospel; there was Matthew

Mark, Luke and John. And when I see the Five, it reminds me of the five
Wise virgins who trimmed their lamps; there were ten of them: five were
Wise and were saved, five were foolish and were shut out. When I see the
Six, it reminds me that in six days, God made this great heaven and
Earth. When I see the Seven, it reminds me that on the seventh day, God
Rested from His great work. And when I see the Eight, I think of the
Eight righteous persons God saved when He destroyed this earth; there was
Noah, his wife, their sons and their wives. And when I see the Nine, I
Think of the lepers our Savior cleansed, and nine out of the ten didn't
Even thank Him. When I see the Ten, I think of the Ten Commandments God
Handed down to Moses on a table of stone. When I see the King, it
Reminds me that there is but one King of Heaven, God Almighty. And when I
See the Queen, I think of the Blessed Virgin Mary, who is Queen of
Heaven. And the Jack or Knave is the Devil. When I count the number
Of spots on a deck of cards, I find 365, the number of days in a year
There are 52 cards, the number of weeks in a year. There are 4 suits, the
Number of weeks in a month. There are 12 picture cards, the number of
Months in a year. There are 13 tricks, the number of weeks in a quarter
So you see, Sir, my pack of cards serves me as a Bible, an Almanac and a
Prayer Book.""

I hear some niggas clockin' major on the other side of town 
Strictly slidin' for a proper come up to come around 
Called up the homies from way back, who dream of gettin' paid 
Then finally get paid with the amount of 80 G's 
6:30 layin' in cut, prepare to get ready 
Me and Ty grew up, mashin' to get our feddi 
Food stamps galore, kick in the door get on the floor 
Make sure my homies get away smooth with the dough 
A hardcore motherfucker raised up not knowin' 
Now my dream is just a dream we're sellin' dope and hoein'
Moms can't tell me shit, I make the rules that I live by 
In and out the house, late at night, and plus I got high 
The homies influenced me to be the G of all G's 
Perfectly innovated to all my homies 
Pull out the Riviera, plus I kick up dust 
Pull out the brain, pull out the thing, cock back and bust 
It's just some gangsta shit, goin down on the Eastside 
Some niggas who died and tried to who ride on mine 
Pull on the 7 Carter with the homey Flossy Floss 
He's the homey from the Beach who's known for takin off 
Pile up the bird then swerve, conversate on smoke and submerge 
Finger on the trigger, contemplatin' on a murder 
I mean, takin life 'for life, cause it's right 
Shit, niggas gotta do, to earn they stripes, straight merkin'

[Chorus: x2]
It's some gangsta shit, that's going down 
Homicide, straight murder/homicide 
It's some gangsta shit, here in this town 
Straight murder

Word on the street is that them D-P-G niggas shot they homeboy 
Now the only sound in the town is gunfire 
Going down I sport the crown I give it up on motherfuckers 
When I roll through I thought you knew about them Doggs in blue 
Now forty-five, niggas bought em by the spot 
I'm on alert I'm down to work every nigga that I shot 
Niggas skied out quick, around the block who know we comin' back 
Post up early on the attack 
Slowly but surely spot an enemy slippin out his domain 
Rode up on him and let him see the twelve gauge 
The homey Ty banged him on GP because we stuffed him then we bagged him 
Cause he violated the rule of the streets 
Two redrums under my belt, it felt good bout to murder 
Haven't you ever heard of a murderer motherfucker? 
Cause I'm, a straight gangsta, doin' what I feel 
Niggas no need to tempt, for me to kill, straight blastin'
The enemy, can't see the hoes who try to get with me 
Understand where I'm comin' from the D-P to the G-the-see 
The niggas who trip, niggas that dipped 
Niggas that conversate with the Bloods or Crips 
It's just a West coast thang, gangsta thing 
Niggas come around here but surely can't hang because-a 
We don't hang with no bustas and sho' nuff 
Don't hang with no fags and niggas down to blast, straight merkin 

[Chorus]

Check it out 
I heard niggas kickin' static makin' noise 
Cold hearted want to get it started with my boys 
Automatic toys to tangle with niggas for profit 
Got shit on lock down cause I lets the Glock spit 
Soon as D-A-Z hits me on my hip, talk about chips 
The game run heatin' them clips, the gaze kicks 
Automatic tech nine spits, I gotta 
Roll with the Pound that's the neighborhood of murder 
Am I the only motherfucker ridin'? 
Am I the only rider but I found a whole pound of niggas violent 
I got the big homey Ty money worldwide 
From Portland, Oregon L.A. to the N.Y. 
I'm bout to crash in your door, unload the double four 
Then stash it, then we blasted all we saw 
The fo'-fo', the fo' double sparkin'
The gang walkin' up your hood like nothin' but trouble 
We straight gangsta shit 

[Prince Ital] 
That's right 
We dat live by de knife will die by de knife 
You betta try save your life 
On your life dere might be a oversight 
Take my ad-vice and jump in a your ride 
Don't are-gue with de Death Row pride 
D-P-G gangstas they nah make you try 
We got keep every stone you keep 
In your life, you betta don't feel strife 
We dat live by de knife will die by de knife 
You betta try save your life

Prince Ital Joe,"Marky Mark intro:
Ha, yeah. I know what you're all thinking
That this is some old Janet Jackson type of @#!
But it ain't about that
This if the real, the street life trauma

Yo, I grew up rough in the streets of Boston, Massachusetts
Lived real ruthless, a wild kid, out to get a bid
Did some #@! that he never shoulda did
Had to learn the hard way
That some day you gotta pay
So what the hey, I say

Prince Ital Joe:
Life in the streets ain't easy
All I see is pain and misery
I kneel and pray for the betrayed
Strength and protection to survive in the society

This is the life in the streets
And that's how we live it

Marky Mark:
Hard and mean at sixteen, livin' like a beam, theme
Out scheming for the green
Quick to kill, I gets ill, I make ya blood spill
I cut ya throat for your goose-down coat
'cause statistic show that kids with no dough
Ain't got no chance, got nowhere to go
That's why life on the streets is like a trifular beat
It'll echo in ya head till you're dead on the concrete

Prince Ital Joe:
Life in the streets is a mystery
Don't know my friends from my enemies
Up to lot, could be trouble
But I'll hold tight and I will never give up the fight

(Chorus)

This one is dedicated to all the homeless people
To every youth that's growin' up on the streets
You know, we're living for a dream one day
That there'll be no more homeless people in the world
Life in the streets is not easy

Peace and love in the ghetto, now
Peace and love in the ghetto

Woe as I wipe these tears from my eyes
Oh yeah, I realize that our lives should be free

Oh as I wipe these tears from my eyes, Oh father

Ich saß im Zug und lernte Hip Hop kenn'
Kein Geld, broke, früh aus dem Elternhaus raus
Mein Plan war, Ich komm zurück und bau ein Traumhaus

Bekam 'ne Wohnung ohne Strom, es war kalt und nass
Vergesse nie den Kühlschrank, der jeden Tag leer war
Köln-Kalk, Hungersnot, jede Nacht schmerzhaft
Kaltes Wasser, Teekerzen leuchten
Lieber Gott, was soll das alles hier bedeuten?

Das war nicht die Vision aus meinen Träumen
Und in Berlin war's vielleicht ein Stück besser
Doch ganz bestimmt kein Glückstreffer
Ja, Gott hat mich hier hingeführt und wieder weggebracht
Durch das finst're Tal, doch ich hab's echt geschafft

Früher hatte ich nichts, ja, wir hatten nicht viel
Mama hat gesagt, du erreichst dein Ziel
Wenn du nicht aufgibst, also trau dich
Aber wenigstens hast du es probiert
Mein Sohn, flieg weit, weit
Weg von hier, flieg weit, weit
Weg von hier, flieg weit, weit
Weg von hier, aber wenigstens hast du es probiert

Orgasmus, wenn sie einem die Hand gibt, Augen wie Bambi
Candy Parfum
Yve Saint Laurent
Ihre Art und wie sie redet

Von der Footballmannschaft

Dreh den Sound auf Marvin Gay

Das macht ihr Angst, aber das versteh ich
Diesen ganzen Mädels
Doch für sie würd ich mich ändern
Und nie wieder Bitches kennen lernen
Nie mehr Party, sinnlos ausgehen
Sondern sie zu meiner Frau nehmen
Und ich hoff nur, dass sie mir das alles abkauft
Dann führ ich sie heut Nacht auf

Ich weiß nicht ob deine Nummer noch aktuell is' umm
Ich wollt mich bei dir melden und dir sagen
Dass es mir gut geht und
Ich hier halt glücklich bin und umm
Drum schick ich auch meine Nummer nicht auch nicht mit
Ich glaub es is'besser so
Aber tu mir bitte ein Gefallen und pass auf dich auf
Bis dann tchau

Ich denk an uns und schreib diesen Text jetzt
Ich vermiss dich immernoch und es stresst echt
Mein Pech wächst seit dem Tag
Als du mich verlassen hast, komm allein nicht klar, immer
Partys hier, Partys da, du bist gegangen
My first love, ja, ich hatt' kein Geld
Ich hatt' kein Fame, damals hieß ich noch Kenneth
Es gab kein Kay doch du hast mich geliebt
Geliebt wie ich bin, vielleicht war ich ein Arsch
Doch Liebe macht blind, aber du warst da, mein Superstar
Ich hatt' kein Problem mit dem Zug zu fahren
Egal wo du warst, ich bin gekomm'n
In der Zeit kannt' ich kein Dom Perignon
Ich war broke und ich konnt dich nirgends einladen
Aber trotzdem sprachen wir vom Heiraten
Lass mich dir eins sagen
Ich vermiss diese Zeit
Wär so gern wieder glücklich vereint, aber nein

Dieses Leben ist kein Wunschkonzert
Ich hab ein' wunden Punkt im Herz

(My first love) Ich will die Zeit zurückdrehn'
Und mit dir ein kleines Stück gehn'
(My first love) Noch einmal nach Paris
Kein Geld, doch wir warn' verliebt
(My first love) Schatz, ich sag Dankeschön
Für die Zeit, es tut mir Leid
(My first love) Wo du auch bist und was du grad tust
Ich hoff' dir geht's gut
(My first love)

Bis jetzt hat's noch keine geschafft
Mein Herz zu bekommen, ich vergleich dich, mein Schatz
Mit jeder Frau die ich kennenlern' und es nervt echt
Keine hier ist perfekt
Manche sind sehr nett, hey und manche nur hübsch
In manchen steckt auch 'ne Bitch
Es ist wie es ist, es kommt wie es kommt, Schicksal
Als die Quittung kam war klar, ich zahl
Ich sah bei uns Zukunft, doch vielleicht waren wir zu jung
„geh mit ihr gut um!“, drohte dein Daddy
Ich hatt' kein Geld doch kaufte dein Blackberry
Denn mir war's egal, ich hab dich geliebt
Und ohne dich leben, macht depressiv
In der Nacht so aktiv, du raubst mein Schlaf, kein Scheiß
Und da hilft kein Geld, da hilft kein Hype
Denn wahre Liebe kannst du nicht kaufen
Die eine unter 100.000

Dieses Leben ist kein Wunschkonzert
Ich hab ein' wunden Punkt im Herz

(My first love) Ich will die Zeit zurückdrehn'
Und mit dir ein kleines Stück gehn'
(My first love) Noch einmal nach Paris
Kein Geld, doch wir warn' verliebt

Auftreten, du könntest echt ein Star sein

But fuck this rules, let's rock along
Every night's a party
I do this 8 days a week
Get up, let's get started
Cause rockstars never sleep

5 AM and the club is still on fire
And tonight we spend all the fucking money
All the tattooed girls, let's get dirty, take your shirt off
Tonight night night night night night night n-n-n-night

Prince Kay One,"Ich hab gedacht, dass es leicht wär
Es wird mir klar, ich muss eins lern'
Schmerz geht, doch die Narben sind für immer
Die Hoffnung scheint unauffindbar
War ich zu jung oder nur zu dumm?
Das mit dir hatte Zukunft
Schatz, ich wollte was festes
Es war'n deine Worte, entweder so oder man lässt es
Ich gab dir mein Wort, hab noch geschwor'n
War noch im Studio, machte 'nen Song
Jeden Tag draußen, Kino, spazier'n
All diese Bilder, sie sind noch hier
Verdammt, ich vermiss dich
Komm zurück, ich werd' anders nicht glücklich
Und ja, ich versteh, was du meinst
All meine Fehler, ich seh sie jetzt ein, dass ich
Nicht da war, das tut mir so Leid
Du hast noch versucht, nicht zu wein'
Auch wenn du jetzt glücklich bist
Bitte vergiss mich nicht, Gott beschütze dich

Zusammen mit dir aufsteh'n, ich sehn' mich so sehr
Die Zeit will nicht vergeh'n, jetzt erkenn' ich dein Wert
Und manchmal tut es weh, wenn man etwas verliert
Die Hoffnung stirbt zuletzt, deshalb blick ich zur Tür

Doch es gibt kein Wiederseh'n, Wiederseh'n, Wiederseh'n
Denn es ist so viel gescheh'n, viel gescheh'n, viel gescheh'n
Allein geh ich jetzt diesen Weg, diesen Weg, diesen Weg
Hast du nicht gesagt „Ich begleit dich ins Grab?“

Wenn ich aufsteh und am Frühstücken bin
Schatz, glaub mir, ich fühl mich so schlimm
Kein Chill'n, kein Kuscheln, kein Sex
Ich sitz nur zuhause und schreib Tracks
Doch jeder Track ist über dich
Ich will, dass es wieder wie früher ist
Weißt du noch, unser erster Kuss
Unser erstes Date, brachte dich zum Bus
Alles war zu schön, doch was ist jetzt?
Das passiert, wenn man jemanden nicht schätzt
Ja, du bist weg, aber wohin?
Sag, warum war ich so blind?
Nein, Geld macht nicht glücklich
Was bringt ein 5-Sterne-Koch, wenn du nichts isst?
Was bringt dir Urlaub allein, Champagner und Wein?
Nein, es bringt dir nichts, wenn du kein' hast zum Teil'n
Jetzt bist du frei, also genieß diese Zeit
Baby, nie wieder Streit und ich will, dass du weißt
Dass ich immer da bin
Bitte pass auf sie auf, amen

Zusammen mit dir aufsteh'n, ich sehn' mich so sehr
Die Zeit will nicht vergeh'n, jetzt erkenn' ich dein Wert
Und manchmal tut es weh, wenn man etwas verliert
Die Hoffnung stirbt zuletzt, deshalb blick ich zur Tür

Doch es gibt kein Wiederseh'n, Wiederseh'n, Wiederseh'n
Denn es ist so viel gescheh'n, viel gescheh'n, viel gescheh'n
Allein geh ich jetzt diesen Weg, diesen Weg, diesen Weg
Hast du nicht gesagt „Ich begleit dich ins Grab?“

Wenn wir zwei allein
Jetzt uns're Wege geh'n
Ich hoff, du weißt
Egal, was auch passiert
Ich bin für dich da
Ich hoff, es gibt ein Wiederseh'n

Doch es gibt kein Wiederseh'n, Wiederseh'n, Wiederseh'n
Denn es ist so viel gescheh'n, viel gescheh'n, viel gescheh'n

Bei dem Spiel wird gechillt und gegrillt, man ich fahre meinen Film
Wir holen uns den Pokal, noch einmal
Wenn der liebe Gott so will gibt es keine Niederlage sag
Was du willst, das Spiel gewinn' wir
Wir braten Curry Wurst und ich trink Bier
Wir feuern besoffen die Mannschaft an
Und fiebern mit, während des Spiels wie das ganze Land
Sind Fußball-Fans schon  seit Anfang an

Prince Kaywood,"It seem to me that we don't always get along
If we are trying now don't seem to try too long
Watching your neighbour seems to fill you with alarm
Just 'cause he's different now
Don't mean he means you harm
City living has got us all pent up inside
When we have problems it seems we all just run and hide
Time to discover why we are feeling this way
Let's let love have its say

I know you need it, brother said he needs it, sister said she needs it, 
We're all gonna need it someday
We seem to loose our way, somehow got led astray
That's why I'm here to say, gotta get back get back to love

We're all gonna need it someday
We seem to loose our way, somehow got led astray
That's why I'm here to say, gotta get back get back to it now

Trouble started when we don't communicate
We'll build our future now or we can seal our fate
Wasted energy on promises we break
We've wasted chance now, but still it ain't too late
There is a common goal we must all realize
It's time to make a change, in how we live our lives
Time to discover why, we are feeling this way

Prince Lasha,"Black cats creep across my path
Until I'm almost mad
I must have 'roused the devil's wrath
Cause all my luck is bad
I make a date for golf and you can bet your life it rains
I try to give a party and the guy upstairs complains
I guess I'll go through life 
Just catchin' colds and missin' trains

Everything happens to me
I never miss a thing
I've had the measles and the mumps
And every time I play an ace
My partner always trumps
Guess I'm just a fool who never looks before he jumps

Everything happens to me
At first my heart thought you could break this jinx for me
That love would turn the trick to end despair
But know I just can't fool this head that thinks for me
I've mortgaged all my castles in the air
I've telegraphed and phoned
I send an ""Airmail Special"" too
Your answer was ""Goodbye""
And there was even postage due
I fell in love just once
And then it had to be with you

Got the raven two-five, inside of my denim
Some said I was the child with the devil in him

Gettin' in trouble when I should of been chillin'

I'm still snuffin' out chumps to be known be	
I gotta live for self and that's scary

You see I only feel safe in solitary
I never regret or feel guilt, cause I was forced to
Take what I had play bad because you
Never understood me or what I came past

Don't you know those other kids takin the same path
But I can handle it, well in stride
The only difference is I'm locked inside
Take it like a champ, and I'll never show no frown

I keep you occupied with different styles
Tell momma don't cook, cause tonight I'm gonna eat out

mouth-waterin' creamy pastry
And you can have it when you want it with ease

Just call me up and say daddy please
You run and tell your friends to try this here
Cause you know that I can leave 'em with a smile and a tear
I know you wanted it from your first look at me

Call it, call my name 

I heard your voice this morning calling out my name 
It had been so long since I heard it that it didn't sound quite the same, no 
But it let me know that my name had never really been spoken before
Before the day I carried you through the bridal path door 

And ever since that day I haven't wanted anyone but you
And anybody who really knows me knows the truth 

[Chorus]
I just can't stop writing songs about you
I love you so much 
I just can't wait to get my arms around you 
And feel your touch 
If I don't see you real soon baby girl 
I might go insane 
I know it's only been about 3 hours 
But I love it when you call my name 

I heard a voice on the news saying people want to stop the war 
If they had a love as sweet as you they'd forget what they were fighting for
What's the matter with the world today? 
The land of the free? Somebody lied 
They can bug my phone and people 'round my home 
They'll only see you and me making love inside 

[Chorus]

I've never seen the moon look so lovely as the night I saw it with you
It let me know I'd never seen the moon before 
So many speak of the moon as though it had no flaws 
But to compare it to a beauty like yours would give one pause 
Nothing about you is false, that's why your love is real 
God forbid if you belonged to another I'd have to steal you 
I'd have to take you from your man 
I might be tempted to break the law round here 
Because your beauty, it gives one pause 
It slows me down 

[Chorus]",Call My Name,1995
Prince Markie Dee,"Want to get lost in the mellow Mellow of my mind
Chop a tree, pay the cost
I rather have a glass of you that's fine
Come on over baby 'round 7
Chill in you're favorite chair

You can watch a tape of this mellow after party
Macy and Common were there
Besides, you know... it takes... awhile... 4 me... 2 do... my... hair

Come on get lost in the mellow Mellow
Come on get lost in the mellow Mellow

How's that feel?

Where you want to eat 2nite baby?
I know this dope spot called one another
Or maybe we might swing by the Egg
The perfect place 2 play house
I could smother you
I just might be runnin' lines
There's just so much you can find
In the mellow of my mind

This rainbow psychedelic
Come and get lost in the Mellow
There ain't nothin' 2 be	 afraid of
Just you and me in the mellow of my mind

I want to get lost in the composition of you
Learn the rhythm and play only the notes you want me 2
I'm a good learner and once I understand
I'll stand under you and let you show me how you want you're man 2 be	
I could dance 4 you- a little comical minuet
If you desire I'll shed my attire
Anything 2 get you wet.

Shower, my flower?
So much 2 do, so little time
So choose wisely and you can find thee
In the Mellow of my mind

Can I sing 2 you while you bring yourself 2 joy?
I'll go slow at first, while you quench you're thirst
Wet circles round the toy
While you bring yourself 2 joy

As she fell in2 the Sensual Everafter, out of bodyout of mind,
She stroked her hair a hundred times.
And as she fell deeper in2 the hypnotic unwind, he counted his way in2 the suggestive mind.
Planting a seed that bears fruit on the tree,
He said, ""Repeat after me. Repeat after me. Repeat after me. 1+1+1 is 3""",Mellow,1995
Prince Markie Dee,"Chorus One:  (Onome) 

Tell me that you want it
Say that you need it
Tell me that you want it
Tell me that you want it
Say that you need it
Tell me that you want it

Verse One:  (Markie Dee)

Love, let me break it down as clear as I can
I'll be suddenly smooth so you can understand
I look gentle, gentle as sun rays 
Calm as a cool breeze
Flowing through your mind with ease
It seems that you want to be more than friends
But all I want to do is to make commence 
My live style keeps me on the move
So just let me explain how you get in my groove 

Chorus One

Verse Two:

It seems you're looking for a faithful
Kind and committed man
And you considered L.D. for the part
Now what makes you think that I'm the man for your hand?
If you plan to reprimand my love and my heart
Now when we first met you were cool
Far from your everyday hoe
That's only out for the doe 
But in time you feelings started to climb
Baby came a little stronger then mind

Chorus One

Verse Three:

Far from your typical I never kick the same old smooth kind of line
To catch a young girls mind
See, what I'm saying is real
It really means a lot to me how you feel
No disrespect, but lovers I don't want to be
All I see is someone I can talk to in front of me
Stop what you're doing
Cause I don't want to ruin
The bond that we got
Cause I like it a lot
You need a man who can give you his all
Stand by your side, pick you up when you fall
For me I be the one that you rely on
The shoulder that you cry on
Someone that will always be near
Through thick or thin
I'm your friend to the end
You're more that just skins love, you're someone who cares
Sit me down and confide what you're feeling inside
If you need me then call and I'll be at your side

Chorus Two:  (Onome)

You just call
I'm your man
And you know, where ever I am
I'll go running
Run in the sea
Winter, Spring, and Summer, Fall I'll be with you

(Repeat Chorus Two 7x)

You just call

You just call

Chorus One And Two",Tell Me That You Want It,1995
Prince Markie Dee,"One minute you're so fly and now you're busted
Sweetheart, we got a lot to discus kid
Your relationship is wavering 
Don't walk away, come here and listen
Cause I speak straight up so they attract 
I'm sorry baby but your man ain't all that
Before you verbally stomp me, just wait a sec
And explain why you're always looking wrecked
By now any other lady would have just had it
Looking depressed at battered, shattered 
Dreams of you two being the perfect item
The feelings you had try to fight them
Cause your man's a conniver so stay alert 
Mark my words you're gonna get hurt
Does your man abuse you physically or mentally?
Change what I put, slavery you need to be free

[Chorus]
So maybe you need to swing my way
Markie Dee can do you right in a fly way
I'm the one you should chose 
Girl you won't be abused
So maybe you need to swing my way
Maybe you need to swing my way
Markie Dee can do you right in a fly way
Not like the man you're with now, I keep my hands to myself
So maybe you need to swing my way

Mistreated you like a towel
And when he gets busted he thinks that he's an owl
Your eye is puffy, your jaw is swollen
You shouldn't be smacked, you're made to cuddle and hold an
Cores and snuggle like a Teddy Bear
His attitude's changed, begins to put fear
in your heart, but you depart from being afraid
Many thoughts of leaving were crushed so you stayed
Saying what he did before he won't do again
He wants more of a lover and less of a friend
Catch my drift? You're put to the test so
You refuse and get struck with a left blow
He tells you in a flame way
""That's what you get for rejecting your man"" Hey
Now you're crying on the floor
Your man's no damn good, need I say more?

[Chorus]
Now I'm not saying I'm an angel, I got many associates 
I treat them all right and appropriate 
I'm not talking marriage and settling down
But I can treat you much better than that clown
No matter what I say you still seem to protect him
No matter the amount of times you're hit you respect him
Damn, if you only knew
How much affection could be given to you
If you move the right way which is my way
Forget what your so-called-boyfriend might say
You're too good for his kind
Widen your horizons and focus your mind
On a real man. I won't stress you or keep sweating it
I'll buy your clothes but pay your rent it's kind of pressin it 
So tell me, who do you chose?
Here's an alter way then either win or can lose

[Chorus: x4]
Maybe you need to swing my way",Typical Reasons (Swing My Way),2000

We had a one room shack and the livin' was low
And my Mama by herself raised me and my bro
Wasn't easy, but we did it with the little that go
Worked hard while the suckers cool every day
And kept her eyes on the stars when the skies were gray
Gave us drive to survive, really showed us the way
Now I really understood what she was tryin' to say

She said, ""Son there'll be times when the tides are high
And the boat may be rocky, you can cry
Just never give up
You can never give up uh-uh

And in order to achieve what you need
You can never give up

I got a wonderful life, two kids on my own
With a strong foundation that was carved in stone
And my mama for the love that made my house a home
Made me wonder some time if this was meant to be
All this for a humble little guy like me
And all I ever really wanted was a family
To teach my kids the same value that she gave to me

I'LL say I wouldn't! 
I would FUCKIN notion to siphon it out.....I'll SUCK it!

Herb smoke stimulates my thoughts
It took me deeper than the reaper's domain
To make it plain as hell
I left my spirit to dwell
But let my lyrics rebel
Documented on record to spark my ? brain cell
I kick a style like Bruce, rockin' this rotten metropolis
Drugs, thugs and slugs, the scene it's so monotonous

Good n' plenty, keeps pockets from getting empty
Blunts get pulled, different day same bull
Shit, you can't own it, two (?) you manufacture it
Take away profit now tell me what you get
I got a size eight, a fried chicken dinner plate
I'm sellin' dreams, you know, rhymes by the weight
Ten years of hustling, brung home the bacon, man
More scramblin' than Moon and Cunningham

Just can't live my life without you, baby come here
Don't have NO fear, ohhh is there a wonder why
I'm really feeling in the mood for love

It even feels better cause I didn't pay money

Let me take you by the hand
Come let us visit out there
In that, new promised land

And maybe there, we can find

And the only slight trouble is keep it up
Sleepin, what? I flips more weight than Oprah
Strips or fate than hope, my skills superb
Crills to herb, to dope I lace brothas
Butter wounds, I bless the spend-er, but test
I bend or waste mothafuckers, rules are broke
Get smoked free of charge
We not drugs but hot slugs, see I'm Large like Mister
I gots no shame, irrational nigga, the cash clouts
Shit ain't no game, it's more like a national past time
Your sales pitcher, down the pipe
Come get a hit, I never fail to get your clown types
I never quit pursuing these crabs, recruiting rehabs in churches

Place that nigga on a hundred-third, then make cream off of bird
Yo I'ma watch em, he come up short and I'm gon' smoke em
Either way you could say I'm that bronc' that broke em
He want to learn, I say give em a chance
He fuck up and the devil'll be havin a last dance
I think he'll do it right, he knows the consequences
The fuck up after that, that shit's true extenses
Every time came we took out, he was the lookout
want to know how much I made?
Just ask one of them niggas to pull the book out
I state this on my word bond, just put him on
In time he'll come up shinin like a mothafuckin Don

A neighborhood infested, that's the good investment
I peeps your operation, let a nigga give me most high
I never been arrested, but expect the unexpected
Wit full pre-meditation, when I run in wit po-nine I freaks the amnesia

It's two o'clock, and who that knockin on the door?
It's like a drum, that's Momma Dukes, ballin, callin me a bum
And then I'm comin to my senses (Yo Dunn, you gotta represent)
Then I see a woman lookin bold, with a cold cup of water
I'm like, ""see'mon Momma, gimme five more minutes""
As we begin it's sun shinin in it my eyes I'm done whinin
Then I rise, I gets the hygiene cleaning
So I'm calling up my peoples then I'm gone
But wait, I notice Momma with the cooking - (""Good looking"")
The eggs, the grits, and yo the muffins
I guess I can sample a little somethin
Sit and think about the night past, stuffin my face
I'm steady thinkin bout that tight ass - I didn't hit it
But whatever, I ate the pudding yo word is bond
That shit was good and yo I said, ""Love hit me off""

Yo shorty catchin feelings, then you know a nigga snuck out

And then I gather up the motherfuckin squad
And continue to steady slobbin'..

I  enjoyed a getting away from day  

To day stress so I need to leave 

Soon. (If that's a case, I have no space 

But for later I'd be sore to (leave?)) 

Nah, nah, that's not gonna do, I know that you 

Can find another flight leavin the same 

Time. I need to get aboard. I can't afford 

Any penalties to sit in the main cabin

So I can take me another trip

When I was broke she'd go solicit other guys 

And if we made love you could see it in my eyes 

My fantasy was one day to be a millionaire 

So I could reassure that my baby girl was there 

I could feel her love, son, I taste it in her lips 

Mentally she was a trip, had a nigga whipped 

A lot of other cats got strung out in the past 

But I'ma get the love last, then I make a dash 

That's what I thought but Miss Thing was too appealing 

When I had no dough for her, she had a nigga stealing 

(Hands hot) Now I'm incarcerated, honey ain't around 

Into withdrawal from her, while I'm locked down 

Two years down I hear she's still a thick dime 

Controllin niggas pockets and even ladies' minds 

(Here she come) ? with a temptin proposition 

(Approaching me) But when she said ""Hi"" I had to listen 

I'm sweatin beans cause I know I'm gonna bait her 

Better do it now cause you're bound to do it later 

I can't refuse her, my denial's a wish 

Fell into her arm when I gave her a kiss 

Cause I like it

Me and Mike will go Twin Hype and do a dance on your windpipes
Put your fucking jazz hands back in your pants and get them shits sliced
Caught the ghost when I was yay high, so today I stay way high
Do not worry about my habits, without sin I'd probably hate life

This is dope as that hard white you stuff in a crack pipe
A hit of this, a kid with Tourrets will chill out and act right
I'm fat but I dress nice and bitches finesse Mike
They suck the dick and squeeze on my belly like bagpipes

I slap and I suck clits, I fuck in my church shoes
Humblest guy in the room and I am in the room too (Get it?)
I'll bend you over on the roof while whistling Audio Two
They say that once a girl go Brooklyn no more soft dick will do

I'm so Rakim and Eric B
Bitches check out my melody
I might Slick Rick on a fella (Foul), catch me a felony
Ay, I might Shyne Po a ho, pow! Catch me a case
Producto must have rolled this L because this blunt feel laced

I must say you do look stunning
I mean, you're the kind of girl I can really see myself artificially inseminating
Oh I'm sorry, I'm being a little aggressive, right?
Can we start from the beginning? My name is Chest Rockwell, right?
And I love to make love to your booty hole
Bad boy

This is born alone die alone, so my dialogue's dastardly
Life's a tragedy generator operating at max capacity
This is porno for piraters, to the crooks it is relaxing
I am foreign to that soft talk, you can tell it from my accent

This is arrogant fat black, it is what it is
This that stingy with dick, bitch, not a fuck do I give
I'm no respecter of person, I'm no respecter of rules
I catch the prince of England slipping, he goin' run me the jewels
I could wake up brain dead tomorrow and my soliloquy still will be
The illest there ever be, 'cause I be what you'll never be
My pugnacious rhyme patterns prove pitbull in my pedigree
And dogs fight to the death, you say you better, you better be

Not one shit given, El-P's chillin'
Raised in a shack in the back of the village
Trained by the wolves in the woods
To avenge on the men who elected themselves my killers
Mike's a villain, Nick Hooks chillin'
We don't have a need to know your feelings
We don't believe in the same shit anyway, Run the Jewels is not for your children

How you feeling now sweetheart? A little more relaxed?
Maybe it's that half a molly I put in your Mountain Dew
Yeah, works like a charm
Just chill out for a second, relax, relax, I got it under control
I got you a glass of Beefeater, I got a brand new deck of Uno cards
Oh yeah baby, the night's just getting started
Okay, how about I come over tonight and pick you up in my brand new Segway
We can go over to Long John Silver's, get a fish platter
You can take me home and massage me with butter all on my neck
I love you",Twin Hype Back,2013

I tried to tell them that I didn't want to sing
But I'd gladly write a song instead
They said okay and everything was cool
'Til a camera tried to get in my bed

Hello my bed hello hello

I was sittin' pretty with a beautiful friend (""Oh darling"")
When this man tries to get in the car
(""'Ey Prince, c'mon, give us a smile eh?"")
No introduction, ""How you been?""
Just ""Up yours, smile, that's right, you're a star!"" (Star)

You call 'em bodyguards but I call 'em my friends
I guess I'm used to havin' 'em around
And cameras by nature like rewards
That's the trouble I get when I'm uptown

I'm not afraid to die (Don't be afraid)
Oh no, there's a better place (Cause there's a better place to go)
I eat what I want (You can eat what you want)
Whole wheat toast (Anything is cool in moderation)
And I'm happy, and that's for sure

We're against hungry children
Our record stands tall
There's just as much hunger here at home

We'll do what we can
If y'all try and understand
A flower that has water will grow

Smooth diff' in this, why'all know what's goin' on with this right here
Yo it's Shawn J., bust it
It's goin' down like that

The Frontline, huh
You don't know what's up with this, uhh uhh
You don't know what's up with this
Doin drama like dis do', yo check it out check it out

My vendetta in this form of musical song
Is to enlighten and brighten the mind through instrument and rhyme
And fix those inadequate flows that don't adapt
Makin' snacks on wax plates for DJs to scratch

Fast slash, cross hatch slash, cross patch
Every word of mine will be verbally so tight to match
That or that I hit you harder than Caterpillar trucks
In the lab where we collaborate or matter will erupt

From a, music martyr, bust mortar, break the order
Torch your sound texture, fire water's in my aura
Your future forefather, your new wave slave wrapped in chains and amulets
And hard to earn assets

Yo, niggas game playin' but not name sayin'
My aim's sprayin', I get mine that's why you stay waitin'
And vacatin', whether you know it or not, I'ma blow up the spot
If you owe me a lot, I'ma show up with Glocks

And you're still wet, pull up your socks, suspend the art
Sizzle like woks, underground spots, from the city to the boondocks
Bounce, double wishbone suspension like shocks
Multiple plans and plots, word

Test these MCs (Word what ugh)
Test these MCs

I spit fire satire, indeed bleed, phenomenal demographics
Broadcast my rhyme forecast to eager addicts
Pave a path many can't outlast
Who these cats who blast gats rehearsin' lines for a movie cast?
But as a central, blaze the track engage
Instamatic sporadic insight pays for days
With their sickening floss, flip on tracks like Dominique Dawes
Pause, date back, flows is gettin' flashback

My existence, spirits in animated film
Three-dimensionally roller scoped
With cloakin' devices, skates, stogies and a motor boat
I hold the Pope for ransom, it's
The handsomest, assassinatin' Satan 
Leavin' the world Marilyn Manson-less
I'm in the streets like Sesame
The recipe - to kill, attain da mil/DeMille like Cecille B.
The rest'll be the aftermath, the most got statistics
Pharoahe Monch, Steve Post about to lift it


I gotta get mine, give it back so you can get yours

I gotta get mine, give it back so you can get yours

I gotta get mine, give it back so you can get yours
Yo yo uhh what

I'm leavin' your staff mated, makin' these crabs hate it
I lotta fags rate it and thought I got stagnated
I'm not some rap nigga that you're dyin to meet
Just another hungry brother real hungry and tryin' to eat
And in the streets you better rely on your feet
Babies is feelin' iron, cryin' to sleep
Plus the government is supplying the heat
They goin' psychotic in prison 'cause of the economic additions
Plus sex and drugs in the bleachers

3-4 come up, run up in beefcake gun butt-ups
Crush truck chains, the wiry gold frames
Chains sums up, the dollars, white collar, blue Range
Eat my dust up, ten in the bucket in the left lane gainin' momentum
Cum sendin' comers, fair game, a lot of sumtin' sumtin'
All in or nothin', silence the sufferin'
Can't stand the strugglin', some resume games to stain jugglin'
I muscled in and scribbled my name

Belittle your brain, the true grain riddle your frame
Got you forfeitin' the bitch by the middle of the game
Hostile, impossible to stop below the free
Buck em down, shook em nothin' at the top of the key
Prince, I'm nippatant, magnificent moves, strategic
Smash joints, leavin' the track paraplegic
Repeat it for those who need it, niggas catch the vibe
Fish 'n grits, hot sauce, forever embedded inside

To me a hollow tomorrow)

The Genie disappear cast out like they ain't seen me (yo) ...

Put the gear in the ignition first it spark my transmission 
I'm gear shiftin fast lane switchin tryin to ditch em 
Escape I got the briefcase full of papers 
Plus the microtape of all the secret society snakes 
Recordings, plan how they want to destroy the black man 
and take every square inch of land and kill the Wu Clan 
What the fuck? My four hundred horsepower truck 
High speed with the Ironman CD turned all the way up 
Shots fired in back of me, they practically hit my tire 
Though I smell smoke, I hope my engine ain't on fire 
Pulled off the road, hope this damn truck won't explode 
Felt like The Saint from the last James Bond episode 
Drivin sixty miles per hour through weed trees and dead flowers 
Bust the overdrive, couldn't control the power 
Pushin through bushes, mud, bugs 
Covered the front and back windshield like carwash suds 
I couldn't sleep, I knew these niggaz was gainin on me 
I tried to bust a 360, I crashed into a tree 
It felt like a bulldozer, knocked my ass over 
I fell out the Rover, grabbed the briefcase ran over 
to a log cabin, had a sign posted DO NOT ENTER 
I bust through the door my body got cut up with splinters 
I ain't give a FUCK, tryin to find somewhere to duck 
Ahh, ahh, uhhhhh, ahh 
and catch my breath, count how many shots I had left 
My clip was full, the first nigga walk through I'm gonna pull 
It was Ivan Korlof, he came through with a sawed off 
Bust the cannon shot and tore the rest of the fuckin door off 
Burst, break, run, jet, flee, boogey, move, be audi 
Slide, duck, dip, bounce, be ghost, escape, blazini, poof 
The Genie, disappear, cast out like they ain't seen me 
Killer Bee, fast lamborghini 
(repeat 2X) 
Junk turned fragments scattered in all direction 
One grazed me, on my kneecap but didn't faze me 
?Count Latree? jumped up, I fired back 
My four-four snub slug, dug a hole in his head 
like Dig Dug, partner crashes in 
with the infrared precision shots, just missin 
Night vision goggles, shit had me boggled 
Forty-Four mag, was too much to swallow 
Held the briefcase in front of my face, jumped through the window 
Daring, got up and went like Dr. Kimball 
I burst, broke, ran, jetted, fled, boogied, moved, was audi 
Slid, ducked, dipped, bounced, ghost, escaped, blazini, poof 
The Genie, disappear, niggaz out like they ain't seen me 
Killer Bee move with the speed of lamborghini

Spending my money, honey, I didn't care
Taking my friends out for a mighty good time
I drank that good gin, champagne and wine

Just as soon as my money got low
I couldn't find no friends and I had no place to go
If I ever get my hands on a dollar again
I'm gonna hold on to it till that eagle grins

'Cause I found out that nobody wants you
Nobody wants you when they find out
That you're down and out
In your pocket, there's not not one penny
And as for friends, you don't have any

Just let you get back up on your feet again
Here they all come telling you their your old long lost friend
And this I wanna tell you and about it I have no doubt
Nobody wants you, nobody needs you
Nobody wants when you're down and out

Del amor que tanto he sufrido y ahora estoy perdido

Pero en mi espalda tu me engañabas

Tal vez no sabes cuanto te amé pero siempre lloré
Aunque tu nunca mi amor lo hayas notado
Tus labios me decían te amo
Y tus ojos me rechazaban
Por eso es que hoy yo mujer ya no te creo

Yo te amé, te adoré
No te quiero ver
Y sufrí hasta el fin
No te quiero ver

Yo te amé, te adoré
No te quiero ver
Y sufrí hasta el fin
No te quiero ver

Duramos una noche amando y la otra pelando
Y aunque todo siguió igual, pasaban los años
A pesar de tus engaños, tú me diste un milagro
Ese fruto de tu vientre que yo más amo

Yo te amé, te adoré

Son tus ojos no lo se
Solo se que me enamore
Y me dejas de querer

Llévate mis besos
Llévate mi alma
Llévate mi corazón
Eres tan perfecta toda una belleza
Hecha para mi amor

Te he soñado
Tantas veces que perdí
Ya la cuenta pero al fin
Hoy he vuelto a sonreír

(Gracias a ti)

Tanto te pensé
Tanto que anhele
Tanto que nunca perdí la fe
Tanto que pinte
Tanto desee
Que llegaras y al fin te encontré

Ahora llévate mis besos
Llévate mi alma
Llévate mi corazón
Eres tan perfecta toda una belleza
Hecha para mi amor

I'm not a good liar
You sat on my pillow
Just taking my pride away

I always heard that one is the lonely one
I wake up thinking 'bout you

If I could fall, fall asleep
With you, with you

Running around, I dropped my heart on my pocket
Should've been headed straight to you
Making my rounds, I think I lost what I got here
Now I can't think of nothing but you

I know they say that wouldn't get so lonely, but do me a favor
End this pain, I ain't slept in days now
Come back home, so I won't be lonely

All of these curves to find you
Girl, you belong to me
We could be naughty

Para que seguir negando
Si el amor entre tú y yo se esta acabando
Es mejor dejarlo todo atrás
Es mejor así amor aunque duela aceptarlo
Este amor ya llegó a su final
Baby te doy tu libertad (Doble U)

No digas que me quieres mas
No me venga a abrazar
Puedes volar como un halcón
Puedes lanzarte del balcón wo wo
Y yo no te voy a llorar bebe
Ya yo te llore bastante y me cansé
Ya ni te aguanto

Ya no voy a sufrir por ti
Vive a tu manera
Ama a tu manera
Y busca alguien que te de lo que no te di
Vive a tu manera hazlo que tu quieras
Y no vuelvas nunca por aquí

Me desespero
En mi cama te anhelo
No sabia que tu castillo fuera tan severo
Yo soy un guerrero y me convertí en un limosnero
Pues difícil entender que tu amor era pasajero
Sediento con el fracaso, sintiendo el rechazo
Los besos en la casa escasos
Sigo fingiendo cada vez con el papel de payaso
Y por dentro el corazón hecho pedazos

Vive a tu manera
Ama a tu manera
Y busca alguien que te de lo que no te di
Vive a tu manera hazlo que tu quieras

Me mata el quebrantó
La relación perdió el encanto
Pasan los días mueren en llanto
Me duele por que yo a ti te di tanto
Si tu amor tiene precio pues dime cuanto
Casi un año haciéndonos daño
Fingiendo el engaño ya me siento como un extraño
No quiero peleas no quiero regaños
El amor que tú sientes a perdido tamaño

Y en tantas cosas que no te llegué a decir 
Y la luna desde lejos me acompaña 
Y me trae tantos recuerdos que perdí 

Y en la radio está tocando tu canción 
La que bailamos tantas veces tú y yo 
Y la lluvia cae tan fuerte en mi ventana 
Y se evapora como gotas de tu amor 

Y las luces de los autos brillan como las estrellas 
En el cielo del dolor 
El camino va pasando y yo voy acelerando 
Como quien busca el amor 
Yo te busco, como un loco, dime

Voy manejando creo que va a salir el sol 
Que diera yo por estar en tu habitación 
Tu contestador responde mi llamada 
Dejo grabado un mensaje con mi voz 

Y te digo que te extraño 
Que eres tu toda mi vida 
Que me ahogo en el alcohol 
Que no acepto que termine esta historia tan bonita 
Esta historia de los dos 
Que ese tipo que pretende 
Secuestrarme tus caricias no va a ser mejor que yo

Might be too much
Maybe we're just foolish now
Stuck here in love
What's so hard to figure out
We both know that we care

Girl I don't mind spending my time
Learning all the perfect ways
To hate you with love
I'll be counting down the days
'Till I don't need you

Just don't let nobody but me

If I'm foolish

Too far for more
I don't wanna wait too long
To kiss you tonight

Knowing I might lose
Who I'm supposed to be
To be by your side
Falling from this gravity

Solo somos imprudentes en este amor 
Somos culpables o inocentes 
Duele si no estás

De odiar con amor, voy a contar noches enteras 
Para no necesitarte más

Un beso y sin más, segundos vuelan con el viento 
Y la vida pasará, se va

Que podría dejar de ser yo y desaparecer 
Por contigo estar, tengo todo que perder

Frost, kick it to these people for real you know what I'm saying?
[verse 1 - Frost]
Time, sits through the hour glass, through night and day
and I watch as the games people play
It's like do unto others than split
and if you can't back up what you say then you ain't shit (yeah)
I've seen the manifestations of the street
so why can't I confess what I see on a drumbeat
like just last night (yo what happened)
I watched these two vatos get in a crazy fight
one of them was quick to pull a knife
he stabbed him in the heart and now he's doing life
in prison at the age of 21 (yeah)
living on death row cause he couldn't let go
caught in the web of violence (damn)
roll deep when they creep, and move in silence of the lambs (yo)

[verse 2 - Frost]
Damn, damn ain't that a shame?
you're lost so take the caution don't play the game
should've listen to the Frost when I was trying to come across to you
but no you didn't think (sucker)
you just keep getting yourself more deep until you sink
so there's no one else to thank but yourself
so go ahead take bow for a job well done
but you'll never see the day of the sunshine or the fun times
just the old days and your old ways
corrupt and wicked
out there doing dirt, instead of just kicking it
pow pow bang bang and all that noise (yeah)
yeah you and all your homeboys
take time to read between the lines
cause ain't no sunshine
[chorus]
[verse 3 - Frost]
(yo kid) I know about being macho
callin' the shots the big time head honcho (yeah)
but here's something even more gacho
one of my homeboys is your old lady Sancho
yo shit happens
I know the lights of all these people right as I'm rapping
while you sit in a cell writing a letter
saying when you get out, your things will be better (right)
but man she couldn't wait
so she's going out on a date
with every Tom, Dick, and Harry
and if you ask me, your shit's getting scary
so how you gonna handle this
when your home's in Los Angeles
acting so scandalous
yo, you can't blame her you didn't take the time
and now, ain't no sunshine

I hate to see that evening sun go down

Feelin' tomorrow like I feel today
If I'm feelin' tomorrow like I feel today
I'll pack my truck and make my give-a-way

St. Louis woman with her diamond ring
Pulls that man around by her, if it wasn't for her and her
That man I love would have gone nowhere, nowhere

That man's got a heart like a rock cast in the sea

Like a Kentucky colonel loves his mint 'n rye

",I Get Money,2007
Princess Cut,"It's funny how money change a situation
Miscommunication leads to complication
My emancipation don't fit your equation
I was on the humble, you on every station
Some wan' play young lauryn like she dumb
But remember not a game new under the sun
Everything you did has already been done
I know all the tricks from bricks to kingston
My ting done made your kingdom wan' run
Now understand ""l-boogie's"" non-violent
But if a thing test me, run for mi gun
Can't take a threat to mi new born son
L's been this way since creation
A groupie call, you fall from temptation
Now you want to ball over separation
Tarnish my image in your conversation
Who you gon' scrimmage, like you the champion?
You might win some but you just lost one

You might win some but you just lost one

Now, now how come your talk turn cold?
Gain the whole world for the price of your soul
Tryin' to grab hold of what you can't control
Now you all floss, what a sight to behold
Wisdom is better than silver and gold
I was hopeless, now I'm more hopeful
Every man want to act like he's exempt
Need to get down on his knees and repent
Can't slick talk on the day of judgment
Your movement's similar to a serpent
Tried to play straight, how your whole style bent?
Consequence is no coincidence
Hypocrites always want to play innocent
Always want to take it to the full out extent
Always want to make it seem like good intent
Never want to face it when it time for punishment
I know you don't want to hear my opinion
But there come many paths and you must choose one
And if you don't change then the rain soon come
See you might win some, but you just lost one

You might win some but you just lost one

You might win some, but you really lost one
You just lost one, it's so silly how come?
When it's all done, did you really gain from
What you done done?  it's so silly how come?
You just lost one

Now don't you understand man universal law?
What you throw out comes back to you, star
Never underestimate those who you scar
Cause karma, karma, karma comes back to you hard!
You can't hold god's people back that long
The chain of shatan wasn't made that strong
Trying to pretend like your word is your bond
But until you do right, all you do will go wrong
Now some might mistake this for just a simple song
And some don't know what they have 'til it's gone
Now even when you're gone you can still be reborn
And, from the night can arrive the sweet dawn
Now, some might listen and some might shun
And some may think that they've reached perfection
If you look closely you'll see what you've become
Cause you might win some but you just lost one!

You might win some but you just lost one

You might win some, but you really lost one
You just lost one, it's so silly how come?
When it's all done, did you really gain from
What you done done, it's so silly how come?

You might win some, but you really lost one
You just lost one, it's so silly how come?
When it's all done, did you really gain from
What you done done, it's so silly how come?

This is a story from my lifes
See I wouldn't want to lie
Getting on by with my lullaby
And all a my friends getting high
Mens holler holler hi all the time
But I can't find no man to love me

Sometimes I get up I'm down
I feel deadened hurt headed I'm down so I sweat it
Through my day this ain't the way chained to the desk
Mess hurt wrists phone fits and post-its
I heard it gonna change but see you in it hard to see
The final minute when
The world is yours all yours
I'll get it I mean it
And in the evenin, I'm alone
Not by the phone but I'm alone yo
Persevere all my fears try to weigh me down
Look around my ceilin's peelin rap deal you feelin I ain't now
Do it myself independent gotta try, no lie
Ain't No Limit kid no Majors
Gonna fuck me up right
I just want to sing a song about my life, my life

[Repeat Hook]

I'm sweet like nickel
Candy debutante on the street what in heat
Caught you haulin at me, mind stallin at me
Need you workin for me, need you talkin to me
Not something fuckin on me, what!
I'm patient like a doctor
Got the stock of proper genius hottest Venus
On top I'll stop your heart drop
Your jaw right to your pe-better heed this
Queen of Mt. Olympus can't resist the goddess honest
The kind you never
Always take home to your mamas
Accomplish what no other can treat you like no other man
Understand this mad mind body you ain't seen in a woman
My mommy possessed this passed this on
Dad made me strong played me mad songs growin up
Told me I be the one well I want the one
Levels deep and heart drum beat
boom beat boom beat
But complex properties of my mind keep em 10 steps behind
Ttakin mad time to find a guy it ain't right
Worthy of my lullaby it ain't right
Try to keep this shit inside it ain't right it ain't right
All night I can drive you wild
The sex the intellect get respect fuck the cheddar
Better bet
I'm the next to get mine find mine it's alright
But sometimes it hurts my mind

Word to God
I'll be the best girl you ever got, I'll keep it so hot
I'll just never stop
I got the plot locked, I got no guns cocked
And if you with me let me hear you say Nana
I'm sure that this is more than you can handle
This example
Coming from a girl placed high up on the mantle
Hold a candle to it, sick of the predicament
Tired of the bull thick headed
Need a sedative to get at it, well I invented it
My case in point I would anoint you my prince
Love you head toe to fingerprints
All benefits laugh and count all our kids,
make all our bids
Butterfly kiss with our lids
Let's make it come all to this

For Flash no road for Kerouac
There might not have been rap

Stuck him in some double Tupperware

Psychotic iconoclast I got an iconic ass
It's ironic how erotic my robotic sonnets
Get girls in bonnets hot like Harry Connicks
Sick on gin and tonics we super sonic hook you on our phonics
Learned Ebonics by erotic ebony dick and Mantronix
Never stoppin' it sock electronic shit
Allotted the whole club up when we spotted it
And if we wanted it fill it with men and spawn and shit
Ain't nothing wrong with it lets get the party started
Shit let's get it on and hit
High ballin' cat callin' no alcohol yo we all suck on a straw
A certain Je ne sais quoi at the bar
I hit it raw never do look back unless we like what we saw
Never do look back OK papa?
On the case like Steve Case estates like Oprah's place
Savoir faire and grace every hair in place
Here's a taste no time to waste
Do my makeup in the mirror while I sit up on your face
We paid great and when we don't got dates
Dig in the crates eat steak and masturbate
Spin wax make tracks we laid laid back
Ladies get laid and stay up late at that
Now we getting critical mass sass pinnacle
Like the citadel not minimal we hospitable
Mad kissable it's difficult aristicral princess
For instance we invincible never divisible make you invisible
Kit in each car Kittens with Kit Kat bars
Kickin' etiquette from Connecticut to Zanzibar
Strip malls to big balls 'n concert halls
New York Dolls taggin' up bathroom stalls
We All-Stars make folly North down to Raleigh
Follow me suck lollys down in Bali
All enthralled dollies arty as Dali
And when Mr. Rodgers calls me
We allowed on his trolley",We Got Panache,2002
Princess Superstar,"I'm the chick who drops sick flows fill bowls
with ill flows ill ho hell knows pantyhose holes full of No Doz
Make your earholes shit pop six Pep Bysmol
sick abysmal bitch suckin dildos instead of dicks for kicks
No time for fake bitches, just sip some orange juice with my real bitches
And I just got three wishes I ain't askin for world peace
I want Range Rovers in three different colors
Genie gimme the damn keys!
Dead wrong like a Dead sticker on a bong bombs
runnin arms and rayguns with Ron Reagan to Vietnam and Iran
I'm blonde and dumb, I just taped over your demo with my song
Gagged sisqo with his thong
I ain't kiddin I'm filled with lil pills of Ritalin
riddle middle men to rob Bailey and Biddle again tell a friend
I use men like Mennen in my armpit I'm bad I can't stop it
Evil twin count as two in your caucus
Tell Murdoch lemme in his office
I'm a steal the carpet then Fox and then Rawkus
Voted for Dukakis, and I like Secaucus
'cause they got the word cock in it

Welcome to my world, such a nice nice girl, welcome to my world
Of course I'm getting lost ran into Kate Moss
Fed her a nine course full of chopped horse and forced her to toss

10 times divorced I speak in Morse
dot dot dash dot dash (HuH?) I just told you had an ugly ass!
Type rash unabashed crass with a brain rash
strapped for cash take me to your trailer I'll steal your trash
Ask me a question, I love to lie
hey look girl is that Jimi Hendrix?
'Scuse me while I kiss your guy
Everyone tells me I'm the female Eminem
well all I'm gonna talk about is getting fucked up the ass then
Don't be mad Em I'm just playin
I wish I had a Dr. Dre and sold out shows one million white faces in Dayton
Ritzes stead of Days Inn bitches for maids then
2 scoops of raisins amazin lays by names like Casey Kasem
Lazin by the pool with record industry fools
Crystal in my drool, man that'd be cool
I'm like Whoa

Let me answer the question of the day
I was born in Spanish Harlem then moved to PA
On 172 and St. Nich. Food stamps and WIC
'til my folks worked themselves rich (this track's making me sick)
If you want to compare me like white Lil' Kim female cool Keith
I'm speak and keep it simple
here's your brain on Princess Superstar pretty mental:
Ok-- I'm the Black Shirley Temple
Iced out like Entenmanns iced pens and diamond engines and denims
Got 10 Yemins countin Benjamins with Lettermans
Killin Pac mens like Inky and Binky
When ya stick your finger in me
it'll be sticky come out with a diamond ring on your pinky
Work six different angles, nicer tits than all the Bangles
Got Kangols singin Star Spangles - Oh Say Can You See
I'm better lookin than the flag you can sing that shit to me
(I'm gonna get in big trouble Louise!)
I'm taking a stance spend my big advance on a 500 man lap dance
Put ants in Bagger Vance's baggy pants sir come dance it's just my circumstance
I want to watch him do the Safety Dance, I'd do it myself but I can't
Or I'll just give my dough to my new label for nice dinners and liquor
I'm playin but, um next year that advance needs to be bigger",Welcome to My World,2002
Princess Superstar,"[Intro Rap]
Pray I yell fore before I play
Before I foray let me explain, all day all ways
Foreplay? Hmmm...
I can make your cock go higher than the hair on Kid 'n Play
How I'm gonna feel when ya next to me

[Hook]
I'm feelin wet wet wet
In the club thinkin bout you all sweatin me
I'm feelin wet wet wet
You rock the decks like sex on some ecstasy
I'm feelin wet wet wet
Come on baby baby just get wet with me
I'm feelin wet--I'm all wet

[Verse]
On the high horse with a pot of hot sauce
Gotta keep floss yeah of course
Super high gloss gold gold on the cars
You say you want to toss baby damn I can't talk
Scorch Hibachi and I'm raunchy
Wet like sake damn foxy
Nasty Girl watch me
I'm getting on my knees you keep watchin hockey
And baby let me give it to ya
Baby grab my ass gonna do the nast nast
Get your filofax-hollaback
Baby don't ask write in this task right in the sack
You're fuckin me from Monday until Sunday
Oh! Here's your EZ Pass
Wet in the pool, wet in the shower
Wet in the elevator, Trump Tower or my lunch hour
Stiff like a broomstick Zoom
I think you need to take me in the bathroom quick ooh
Look and you can have it
Eatin out? This pussy got 4 stars in Zagat attack it
I'm a cunning linguist twist words round my tongue
And I ain't gonna rhyme the next one
You do it after I'm done",Wet! Wet! Wet!,2002
Princess Superstar,"[Verse One]
I'm the flyest MC the finest MC
The nicest MC oh that's boring see, there's another MPC
So why you think most hip-hop sounds the same except for me?
Cryptic kick shit from the crypt
Sadistic lick hits with wit I'm quick
Rip crickets in a wicket I'm plain wicked
Thick in the rig wearing kid lipstick
I wreck shit on the next shit
Spit it in ya ear bit like a Q-Tip
Big silly bitch wickedy witch lickety split
in a sitch no dick but talk big carry a big stick
So I'm a girl, yeah I'm white
And I write all night with a bare swingin light
On the computer alright a producer alright
I produced this song
So you know who you are you know you were wrong
No I was not in that porn ""On Golden Blonde""
Got it goin on more James Bond than Sean John
Conned James Cahn for a ticket to Cannes
And I Love Ferris Bueller like tchhickachickkaa

[Whispered Hook Repeat 2x]
Please don't ask me who writes my lyrics
I'll spit up in your face much faster than you could hear it

[Verse Two]
Don't ask me who writes my lyrics
Damn ya you're enamored I'm a slam ya
Hotter than your can down in Alabama
Where's my camera I need a Kodak moment
of the moment I made you feel like Hammer
Son of Sam? I'm the daughter of Sam
Slaughter a man on the microphone
Pardon me ma'am was that part of a man
or your son I just whipped on the mic and sent home
Big quick shit New York- Stockholm
Kike and a Wop Wipin a cock
Walkin the block drop ya jaw to jock to your sock
I get that a lot yeah stop take stock
Shhh let me show you what I got
Made up my mind- like made it up I imagined it
I don't got a mind I abandoned it in a cabinet
So I could be a candidate for writin a few hits
walkin a few pits and cashin in on that shit
I put out my first tape in '94 if you got one, I'll buy it
I don't got one no more it was called Mitch Better get my Bunny
That shit was shitty but funny
I admit it was dumb but I did it with no money
In 9-5 my first CD called Strictly Platinum
but it didn't go Platinum it went back to them
And instead of waitin for someone to put me on
I started a label ran it 'til the money was gone
Then came along, then was gone
Money money money, don't try to make it with your songs
But like Salt 'n Pepa in El Segundo we push it along (Push it!)
And then Fat Beats wouldn't take my last LP
So I got egg beaters threw em back at the backpacks on 6th Ave. passin me
At the Bagel Buffet planted a bomb next to Grays
And when the records rained I sold 'em back for double to Fat Beats in LA
It's all OK 'cause when Fat Beats still wouldn't distribute my record
I renamed it-Pharaoh Monch featuring Chubby Checker
Ha ha mic wrecker don't sleep, Princess Superstar - The shit is deep",Who Writes Your Lyrics,2002
Princess Superstar,"Please don't mess with me I'll spit you out like you were Sunny D
Did you really think you could be mean baby? Listen this next part is key,
You play a lot of Nintendo, smoke Endo
As far as men go, when ya gonna hit a crescendo and throw Super Mario and Atari out the window?
Now, we have something in common-You're lactose intolerant I'm wack host intolerant
Stop talkin about smackin crack hoes you're in college apologies accepted
I might have left lyrical holes in your mind
You'll fill it later with Cable or Hot 97 or Taco-Bell-n applyin, you want to play? Fine
Play-doh, roll you through a machine until you come out in little strings
I'm obscene I really could eat like 5 Krispy Kremes
Like when they're hot-Like all my tracks are hot
I'm hot, I'm hot, I'm hot, I'm hot, I'm hot, I'm hot, I'm hot, I'm hot-Like all my tracks are
hot
Stop going on AOL chat to try to find friends, yeah everyone likes you because you said you
were tall, slim and
Liked Dre over Ren, Cage over Em, Rage over them, Bahamadia over Lil' Kim
I had no idea you been down with hip-hop since you were ten
You were out ya playpen rubbin Barbie all over Ken and marveling over your carving
Of Led Zeppelin in your desk in ya den
I'm hittin mad skins you got bad skin get rad skins for your MP3 player kid I'm a Real Player!
Hard like Slayer while you a dater with Darth Vader I'm famous-later-
I hang with both Ralph Nader and Roc Raida, OK?
I swear I'm super you play boring Solitaire on your computer combed over hair
Wear a boober shirt work at Hooters in your underwear look like Mr. Hooper I don't care
I was nice to you originally what I'm doin is gonna ruin you like Druid ruins hear the crowd
booin naturally
Actually this is a big 'ol waste of my time
I would rather be home playing with my parakeets than making up this stupid rhyme
I mean, I am a sensitive Pisces and I wouldn't want to make you start cryin-Yeah start cryin
You get mad at Napster when nobody's even heard of you
I did a search on your name and came up with 1 result-
It was your computer, you're a loser
Lame, your screen name pseudo hip-hop sounding lingo mixed up lowercase/capital letters
What you think this is Bingo? I got singles out already
People know my name in discerning circles from New York to LA
While you earn Colonels jerk pay spurt on dirty curtains in a big shirt singin Hip Hop Hooray
You're idle I'm an idol you're not entitled I got a title
Nobody trades your file chill child when I said I liked you I was just tired
Go occupy yourself for a while you're lost whatever just frick off, vile in denial just step off
Why you think I get deals from record labels you get deals from drug dealers
Unappealing insincere won't eat Happy Meals you spill bong water like tears filled with lost
fear
Do acid and beer and trip out on how your queer little beard looks so weird in the mirror man
Guitar noodlin and patchouli let me teach you Ital-go Fongule
When I was in high school I'd a thought you were so fuckin cool
Anyway as I was saying before my screen name is much better than yours, its' -----
What you think I would tell you so you can Instant Messenger me all day?
I don't think so I am very important and right now I am eating lunch
Go get signed to Ruffhouse go away, bid on Ebay for a stuffed Mickey Mouse in a mug,
A sticky handcuffed pic of buff Courtney Love, one of Prince's aborted doves, a Jackson glove,
A blow up Peter Max pillow of Love, a diamond rug, or somethin worth more than all that stuff:

Princess Superstar,"Its so easy
When everybody's tryin to please me
I was just leaving
Got important stuff to do
Like buy shoes and hate you
War is the perfect excuse
To do everything bad I ever wanted to do
Because nothin really matters when nothin really matters
To anyone that matters

C'mon get it out spit it out take it out of me
C'mon get it out suck it out take it outta me

Yeah you're real stoned now
High on power and cocaine
Even though nobody good took that since 1979
Fuck it, pass me a line
I meant a line for my song
Everything is wrong living in oblivion is really fun
Got a hole deep in my soul
Cliche
But hey hey...hey...hey

C'mon tear it out spit it out take it out of me
C'mon get it out tear it out take the artery

Time to reassess my mission
Wish I had religion
For some nice tunnel vision
Go ahead get that smile you get on your face when you get a taste
But just in case
Remember I can press erase
I got two friends to take care of me
Apathy and technology
I'm such a commodity
A musical comedy everyone wants a part of me

And then I had a dream where everyone on earth died except for me
I went to the mall , you know like that movie
And when I woke up and I looked at the newspaper
And I thought, is that all there is?
Is that all there is?

C'mon tear it out spit it out take it out of me
C'mon get it out suck it out take it all from me
C'mon tear it out spit it out take it out of me
C'mon get it out take the heart take the artery",Artery,2005
Princess Superstar,"If you had a machine that could make you into anything you wanted to be, like anything, what would you be?

let's see
I want to be the queen no I want to be 19 wait no I wanna be that horrible thing I saw last night in my dream oh I know! I want to be a supermodel she's European
A lean sex fiend oh thank god I can finally fit in those dumb jeans
Poof then it was me
I was her
I waited for something fabulous to occur
Somethin/ marvelous and absurd
I waited there was nothing
But I was something
Gorgeous crazy wealth and I could always reach the top of the supermarket shelf
All of a sudden I was no longer the model or myself
I must have thought about being a stupid box of cereal up on that stupid shelf
Boring wondered whether I would wait forever
I guess I was a brand that wasn't adequately advertised on tv ever
But it got better
Apparently a parent and a child threw me in a cart
It was hard I was smothered covered by a world of pop tarts
And a part of the newspaper that scared me, I think it was the pop charts
And I wish I was a cereal that..that. wasn't so smart

do you want to step inside my machine?

we all got home and they put me in the fridge
Damn why didn't they keep their cereal out so I could at least see where they lived
But I could hear them and it seemed like they were happy
When the kid wasn't napping she was always laughing
I felt jumpy my bran was crackling
I was grabbed along with the milk put in a bowl
It was dark /a black hole / must have been the kid's mouth/ I don't know
And in I went
Down the throat past the tongue by her heart by her lungs
And I could see she might be dying young
So I tried to patch it up with an old piece of gum that was there
But the damage was done disease had won it wasn't fair
But I wasn't gonna be the one that lost her
I wasn't a doctor
And I wasn't
A name on the list of somebodys roster
Why bother
And by that time I was already out the other end
In the toilet with milk
You know my old friend from the fridge from way back when and then
We got sucked down into the pipes
What a crappy life
Machine that's really not right

do you want to step inside my machine?

I can't stand it I said machine why are we here?
And it paused and said 'to play video games and drink beer'
That's weird you're subversive I thought we had a deeper purpose underneath the surface why do so many of us feel worthless
The machine said don't ask me ask your magazines
People and teen and loads of shit people don't need I started to bleed
And said just make me into bandaid the size of a giant pancake
Wrap me around the whole world to heal the heartache
And if anyone's hungry well
They could just eat me or I'll be a peace treaty and no one could ever defeat me
It said chill out girl remember being on the shelf
I seem to remember you kind of just / wanted to be yourself
No. I wanted someone to pick me, to love me, to be the greatest brand
I don't understand I was just trying to comprehend man
Oh you wanted the grand scheme the big plan the answer aha well here it is -

and then it turned off and that was it
Because you see the machine
Never really did exist

do you want to step inside my machine?

would you be a doctor
Would you be a rocker
Would you be a parka keepin someone warm in a lock up
Would you be a marker
That signed the constitution would you start a revolution or just play some pro soccer
How about a stalker
If you were a father
Would you be good at all or would you even bother
Be a beautiful girl or someone that could call her
Would you be a good talker
Stealth bomber
What about osama
Just to see what it feels like
'cause we all love to live in drama

be a big movie star
Fancy ass houses big car
Doin lots of drugs fuckin up an break laws
Be a fat man plumbers butt hangin out the drawers

Chew on people like jaws
Instigate wars push the button

Ok marriage
1.3 baby carriage
2 cars garage

would you be president
Would you be American
Would you be be better than everyone else as a representative
Would you be a monkey
Would you feel lucky
Would you be a big dick always fucking
Would you be a pumpkin
Would it be your brain inside a vegetable
Or would you feel nothing

Would you manage or would you suffer
Would you be a lover
Be a fighter

Could you just be alright

Princess Superstar,"[Keith's rhyme]
Baby, can you feel my love?
I got my shorts on-
And I'm taking them off
Now when I saw your face I'm a believer
Hey what you got the keys to my Beamer
A keeper get the fever viva end receiver
Oochie Wally Wally leave it to my Beaver
Take a big sip and inhale, you tip the scale
If this rap game don't work out baby you cut for Chippendales
I got my nails done for this special day, Oil of Olay
Case of Criss in piss in the bidet I'm Miss rappin Jon Benet
Big hunk blowin spunk in the back of the top bunk
Slam dunk Daft Punk's voice box in the water kerplunk
Get krunk forget Clyde and Bonnie Ted Bundy and Peg Bundy Burt and Loni
Nancy and Ronnie Betty and Barney smokin mariwanni, I'm a little horny
On and on a common bond two vagabonds in Vuitton
Eatin Cinnebons at a mall on Mars where we belong
Arm in arm naked making spawn at the salad bar get salad tongs deliver our new baby born
Wait something's wrong, I gotta call my moms tell her Keith's on my song
Ultramagnetic you helped my headache like a music paramedic you mad athletic there I said it
I'm older now, Come 'n get it
We're like Doin it and Doin it well, So poetic

[Keith's rhyme]
You and me like ET and Drew Barrymore
Pick Reese's Pieces off your piece I want to marry more Keith
You'll be comin soon to a theater near me
Veni Vidi Veni Veni-I came I saw I came and I came again that's three

[Keith's rhyme]
I think about you and the things you say when you rhyme
Won't beat around the bush so you can beat around mine
I'm a Slinky, coil my butt back and forth down the stair I'm kinkier than pubic hair",Keith n Me,2006

Anyway you want

The problem if that's easier
In your head
Move the pieces around
Things I've said
Turn the memory upside down

And it makes it better I know
But sometimes it's hard to swallow

In time I will fade away

The things they wanna hear and see
Start the drums
Band against the enemy

The minute I'm coming, I'm up and about
I want to tear your rhythm down
Your feet keep moving to the beat of the crowd
And I'd love to see you drown
I want to lick your skin, I want to suck it in
I want to tear your rhythm down

Empty bottles and broken shells
I'm gonna hold you till you drop
Moving, falling, slipping fast
Your silk and purring voice won't last
The pounding in my veins won't stop
I want to tear your rhythm down

Baby lies in bubbles
Floating on ice
Waiting for me to hold my breath
Looking for love and sudden death
Just let me wipe your sins off the face of the earth
I want to tear your rhythm down

I'm out here stackin' duckies
Playboy all about my bunnies
That's why I love it when you hit me, tellin' me how you rub it
I like 'em freaky tales, followed up by picture mails
I hit you back with somethin' cool, make you feel me like some braille
I'm on my humble hustle
Tryin' to stack a gang of Ruffles
So me and you can bubble (Bop, bop, doo-wop)

Everytime we have relations

And she love communication
That's the best thing goin' on
Yeah, we wireless and mobile
Let's take off, feel is global
Let's go rent us some mo-mo
Post up with a gang of dodo (Bop, bop, doo-wop)
And my Blackberry crackberry, iPhone evil
Bust out the webcam, girl let's keep it incognito (Bop, bop, doo-wop)

Prinz Pi,"Ich komm' wie Jimi, geh' wie Kurt
Mit ei'm Knall so laut, dass ihn jeder hört
Altes Manowar-Shirt, die Jeans mit Loch
Chucks war'n weiß, sie sind grau, viel gerockt
Stets mit Andrew aus Illinois, Indie-Base
Stets mit meiner Entourage, Vinnie Chase
Blauer Stern der Jugend, Verrückte am Abhäng'
Unschuld bleibt sitzen auf der Rückbank des Mustang
Leb' die Raubkopie von dem Traum der Amis
Dreh' mein' eigenen Film, schreib' mein eigenes Lied
Herz schlägt manisch sein' eigenen Beat
Viele gekriegt, viele verbraucht, eine geliebt

Eine geliebt eine geliebt
Eine geliebt eine geliebt
Eine geliebt eine geliebt (eine geliebt eine geliebt)

Du hast die hohen Schuhe an und trägst deine Tattoos
Um die Schultern und den Hals wie ein seidenes Tuch
Ich bin verliebt wie ein Junge mit dem Bauch und darunter
Weiß, unter deinem Kleid warten tausende Wunder
Meine Eltern ha'm gewarnt, meine Freunde geflucht
Doch die Schrift auf dei'm Rücken is' mein heiliges Buch
Ich bin das Wild in dem Scheinwerferlicht deines Blicks
Ich hab' den Glauben, doch mir fehlen die Beweise für dich
Die Nächte sind gegen Ende intensiver denn je
Zeit war nie so zäh wie warten drauf, dich wiederzusehen
Auf dem Boden von der Flasche liegt ein tieferer See
Als man glaubt, wenn man taucht, ist die Liebe zu sehen
Meine Sonnenbrille sitzt im Gesicht wie geklebt
Die Kompassnadel dreht weg vom richtigen Weg
Meine Beine, die sind müde von den Treppen der Frauen
Sie applaudieren immer noch für den lächelnden Clown

Und du bist, alles für mich, alles das, was mir Angst macht
Meine silberne Kugel, mein Kryptonit und mein Anthrax
Du bist das, was ich vom Schicksal verlangt hab
Die Patrone für mein' Kopf in der Kammer der Pumpgun

Und du bist, alles für mich, alles das, was mir Angst macht
Meine silberne Kugel, mein Kryptonit und mein Anthrax
Du bist, das, was ich vom Schicksal verlangt hab
Die Patrone für mein' Kopf in der Kammer der Pumpgun

Wenn der Whiskey mir nich' hilft, fahr' ich nachts ohne Licht
Durch die Vorstadt, auf der Suche nach dem, was du nicht bist
Die SMS, die ich will, hast du nie abgeschickt
Unter der Laterne wartet meine Seele auf dich
Deine Augen lügen nie, nur dein Mund is' ein Dieb
Der jeden Coup mit dei'm Lächeln und dei'm Kuss unterschrieb
In dei'm Bett bin ich sicher vor den Klippen der Welt
Meine Rebellion is' an dein' Lippen zerschellt
Du bist der Abspann vom Film und ich sitze noch da
Du bist besser als du glaubst, auch wenn du es nich' magst
Ich weiß, alle deine komischen Geschichten sind wahr
Der Tag hat gestimmt, es war nur nich' das richtige Jahr
Was du denkst oder fühlst, hast du niemals gesagt
Wir liegen auf der Decke und ich rieche dein Haar
Ich bin zuhause wo du bist, egal welches Hotel
Dein dunkler Zauber lenkt die Zeit, darum fließt sie so schnell

Und du bist, alles für mich, alles das, was mir Angst macht
Meine silberne Kugel, mein Kryptonit und mein Anthrax
Du bist das, was ich vom Schicksal verlangt hab
Die Patrone für mein' Kopf in der Kammer der Pumpgun

Und du bist, alles für mich, alles das, was mir Angst macht
Meine silberne Kugel, mein Kryptonit und mein Anthrax
Du bist, das, was ich vom Schicksal verlangt hab
Die Patrone für mein' Kopf in der Kammer der Pumpgun

Meine Finger erinnern jede Narbe von dir
Deine Augen lassen Dinge ihre Farbe verlieren
Du lehrst mich die Wunder, die die Welt mir verschwieg
Seit der Typ mit den Tafeln von dem Berg runter stieg
Die Bilder auf deiner Haut, sind die Karte zu dir
Auch wenn dein Bus nie kommen wird, ich warte noch hier
Melancholie ist die Lederjacke meines Vereins
Ich trag' sie, weil das Leder meine Zeilen beweist
Du bist das Logo meines Clubs, die Hymne der Guten
Die traurige, rauchige Stimme der Jugend
Der Sound der Nacht, Stille und Gebell von ei'm Hund
Besser Rebell ohne Grund als Rebell ohne Mund!

Und du bist, alles für mich, alles das, was mir Angst macht
Meine silberne Kugel, mein Kryptonit und mein Anthrax
Du bist das, was ich vom Schicksal verlangt hab
Die Patrone für mein' Kopf in der Kammer der Pumpgun

Und du bist, alles für mich, alles das, was mir Angst macht
Meine silberne Kugel, mein Kryptonit und mein Anthrax

Prinz Pi,"Sie kommt am nächsten Morgen, sieht durch aus, riecht nach Rauch
Knickt auf ihren hohen Schuhen fast um, flucht, zieht sie aus
Frage sie, wo war sie, sie sagt, bei ihrer Freundin
Ich sag' zu ihr: ""Verarsch mich!"" Sie sagt: ""Du weißt gar nichts!""
Sagt: ""Na gut, war noch feiern mit paar Leuten, aber ey, da war nichts
Kenn den Typen halt auch von der Arbeit
SMS nicht bekommen, Akku war nicht geladen
Geh' kurz duschen, nerv mich nicht, muss jetz' schlafen""
Ich fang' an zu fragen, sie hat mir nix zu sagen
Geh' raus, geh' zur Arbeit, hab' Lust mich zu schlagen
Doch bin kein guter Boxer, bin nur scheißwütend
Auf diesen Scheißtypen, endet meist übel
Vor allem für mich selber, all dieser Mist mit Weibern
Warum steht auf meinem Dach kein Bitch-Ableiter?

Unter meiner Haut wimmelt es von Ameisen
Kann ich keiner trauen? Gibt es noch Wahrheiten?
Sie frisst mich auf, sie frisst mich auf
Eifersucht, ich bin zusamm' mit meiner Eifersucht

Unter meiner Haut wimmelt es von Ameisen
Kann ich keiner trauen? Gibt es noch Wahrheiten?
Sie frisst mich auf, sie frisst mich auf
Eifersucht, ich bin zusamm' mit meiner Eifersucht

Ungewissheit macht den Tunnelblick, ich klicke mich ungeschickt
Durch ihr Facebook, ich wette er hat sie rumgekriegt
Heut' Mittag ihr Hundeblick, ja, die hat was zu bereu'n
Treff' mich jetzt mit 'ner Neuen, das wird sie nich' grad freu'n
Bin voll der Kindergartenspasti, seh die Fehler klar, doch mach sie
Ein verletzter Vollidiot macht irgend'ne Fick-Bekanntschaft aktiv
Mein Telefonbuch is' lang, doch diese Nächte länger
Die Gefühle werden nich' schwächer, nur weil ich sie verdrängt hab'
Und ich vermiss' sie schrecklich, vermisse wie sie riecht
Jede Nacht geht meine Hand von selbst dahin, wo sie sonst liegt
Und wenn wir telefonier'n, bin ich nich' nett, doch will das gar nich'
Ich bin sauer auf mich selber, weil sie nich' mehr in meinem Arm liegt

Unter meiner Haut wimmelt es von Ameisen
Kann ich keiner trauen? Gibt es noch Wahrheiten?
Sie frisst mich auf, sie frisst mich auf
Eifersucht, ich bin zusamm' mit meiner Eifersucht

Unter meiner Haut wimmelt es von Ameisen
Kann ich keiner trauen? Gibt es noch Wahrheiten?

Prinz Pi,"Nach der Morgenröte kam das Tagesgelb
In der Nacht waren wir blauer als die Farbe selbst
Jetzt is' alles monochrom, der Mensch ist elektrisch
Seit du weg bist, bin ich ohne Strom
Es is' wahr, am Ende werden nur Narben bleiben
Die Schmerzen werden klein und groß mit den Jahreszeiten
Irgendwann werd' auch ich auf ihre Bahre steigen
Du bist und bleibst mein großes Fragezeichen
Als du mich anschriest, ich soll' mich verpissen
Als ich dich anschrie, so anti ""was is denn?""
Als du das Telefon warfst, das Telefon dann
In Zeitlupe an meiner Schläfe zersprang
Als Blut aus dem Riss an der Stirn aufs Parkett floss
Ich ging, mich abends dann sowas von wegschoss
Wir uns liebten in Trümmern des Laptops
Vom Streit, nach diesem, auf Schreien folgt Liebe
Auf Weinen folgt ein Gefühl, das traurig und süchtig zugleich macht
Der Geruch von dir war meine Heimat
Deine wahren Lügen, deine andere Ansicht
Dein Blickwinkel, scharfes Blau, das mich anblitzt
Dein Muttermal auf dem linken Schulterblatt
Das, was du zu mir sagtest, was ich erduldet hab
Das, was ich zu dir sagte, was du verziehen hast
Die schlafende Welt der Nacht war unser Spielplatz

Wenn das Abendlicht in genau dieser Farbe ist
Dann ist ein Loch in der Luft, wo du standest
Hörst du mich, wo du bist?
Bleib genau da, bald komm ich nach, also wart auf mich
Wenn das Abendlicht in genau dieser Farbe ist
Dann ist ein Loch in der Luft, wo du standest
Hörst du mich, wo du bist?
Bleib genau da, bald komm ich nach, also wart auf mich

Im Kokon auf der nächtlichen Autobahn 
Bei Tempo zweihundert, sind wir ganz allein, sind wir ganz sicher
Sind die Streifen aus Lichtern unsere einzigen Zeugen
Denken beide: „Die ganze Welt kann mich mal“
Gemeinsame Einsamkeit
Zwei Egomanen, zwei Wenigschläfer, ein Melodram
Du hast eine Schwäche 
Dein kleiner Helfer, der dir half und half, bis du nicht mehr du selbst warst
Als wir uns kennenlernten, warst du vier Jahre älter
Als wir uns trennten, acht und die Stadt ein paar Grade kälter
Zu viel gezogen, zu viel, um irgendwie zu klappen
Futter fürs Ego, Anabol für deine psychischen Macken
Du bist mir entglitten, der Fluch der schwarzen AmEx
Tod auf Raten, gekauft mit dem Geld deines Vaters
Ich wollte dich halten, doch war zu jung, war zu dumm, war zu stolz
Auf ihre Art hatten wir beide uns're Nase voll

Wenn das Abendlicht in genau dieser Farbe ist
Dann ist ein Loch in der Luft, wo du standest
Hörst du mich, wo du bist?
Bleib genau da, bald komm ich nach, also wart auf mich

Wenn das Abendlicht in genau dieser Farbe ist
Dann ist ein Loch in der Luft, wo du standest
Hörst du mich, wo du bist?
Bleib genau da, bald komm ich nach, also wart auf mich

Als mein Handy dann klingelte, mit deiner Nummer
Ich erst mal nich' dranging, beim dritten Mal unter
Fluchen dann doch, als irgendwer dran war
Der fragte „Wer sind Sie?“ Von dir ein Bekannter?
Er sagte, meine Nummer wär' die letzte gewesen
Die du vor dem Unfall dann wähltest
Als dein Vater, den ich nie getroffen hab', sagte
Dein Wagen, Brücke, mehrfach überschlagen
Sekundenbruchteile, keine Bremsspur zu finden
Selbstmord, Zehnter Mai, Beerdigung München

Dann klicken, Stille bei klingelnden Ohren
So bin ich erfroren im inneren Norden
Wie ich mich anschrie, wie sich alles zusamm'zieht
Wie mich jeder Mensch seitdem anklagend ansieht
Ich hab diesen Song hier schon x-mal geschrieben
X-mal verworfen, nie die richtigen Worte
Auch diesmal is' alles nicht perfekt genug
Ich fahr' in Tokio durch Shibuya mit dem letzten Zug
In dem flackernden Neonlicht, in der Scheibe seh' ich dich
Ich wär' gern da, wo mein Mädchen ist
Mein eiskalter Engel
Wie oft ich versucht habe, dich um jeden Preis zu verdrängen
Deine klassische Tiffany-Silberkette
Noch heute sehe ich in Menschenmengen manchma' deine Silhouette
Es ist ein tiefer Schnitt, wo du warst
Doch irgendwas ist da, da ist kein Nichts, wo du warst
Da ist Licht, wo du warst, ein Schimmer, ein ganz kleiner
Ich kann ihn sehen, sonst sieht ihn keiner
Wenn du auf der großen Party bist, reservier' uns den besten Platz
Dann reden wir über dein' letzten Satz

Wenn du oben bist, dann wart auf mich im Licht
Wenn du unten bist, dann trag dein Kleid mit Schlitz
Die Schecks, die mein Mund schrieb, die waren nich' gedeckt
Ich hab gesucht, aber es gibt niemand', der dich ersetzt
Und ja, es stimmt, wir beide waren nich' perfekt
Zu viel Streits, zu viel Drama, zu viel Sex
Du warst mein neuer Kontinent, ich hab' dich entdeckt
Wenn ich dich wieder treff', dann geh' ich nicht mehr weg
Dann geh' ich nie mehr weg
Geh' ich nie mehr weg
Dann geh' ich nie mehr weg
Nie mehr weg",Laura,2011
Prinz Pi,"Man führte uns ins heilige Land, hier fließt Milch und Honig
Drum wurden alle Menschen dick und klobig
Alles klebt, denn die Leute vergaßen
Vor lauter Freundlichkeit die Flut und die Heuschreckenplagen
Sie trauern nicht wenn lebende Geschöpfe sterben
Nein, erst wenn aus Regentropfen Frösche werden
Sie schmücken sich mit Lack ihre Füße
Doch bei 'nem 40-Tagesmarsch durch die Wüste
Machen sie Halt, und wissen nicht weiter
Die Masken fallen ab, denn ihnen rückt nun die Zeit ab
Und sind sie kniend am Beten, lassen alles liegen und stehen
Denn sie werden ihren Kindern erzählen:

Als die schwarze Sonne kam
Wurde alles zu Staub
Sie nahmen uns alles was wir hatten
Bis auf die Haut
Als die schwarze Sonne kam
Wurde alles zu Staub
Soldaten feuerten Raketen in den Himmel hinauf
Doch nichts hielt sie auf

Wir kamen ins gelobte Land, erst kam das Dope und dann
War der Himmel wo einst Gott war voll mit Satelliten
Wer beide Backen hinhält der geht ohne Kampf
Je doofer man sich klug stellt desto eher kommt Jehovah dann
Im Buch steht Moses hat das Meer geteilt
Doch wenn es fast nichts gibt, wird nichts mehr geteilt
Dann wird geschossen und gemordet bis nur Erde bleibt
Stolze Schiffe sinken in die blaue Tiefe - Schwermetall
Wir sahen durchs Teleskop Galaxien, riesengroße
Durchs Mikroskop ins Allerkleinste, die Atome
Nur das Richtige sah niemand seit der Blitz von Hiroshima
Seelen trank ging es nur voran solange Krieg war

Als die schwarze Sonne kam
Wurde alles zu Staub
Sie nahmen uns alles was wir hatten
Bis auf die Haut
Als die schwarze Sonne kam
Wurde alles zu Staub
Soldaten feuerten Raketen in den Himmel hinauf
Doch nichts hielt sie auf

Und deshalb lassen sie's uns ausbaden
Hatten alles, aber alles war nicht das was wir gebraucht haben
Herztod, Schmerz zog, Glaube verstummt
Wir machen Wasser nicht zu Wein, Nein, wir saufen uns dumm
Zwischen Servus in Bars, der Gefährdung des Staats
Kein Platz für Engel in 'nem Himmel, wo sie Airbusse fahren
Der verlorene Sohn ist heimgekehrt, is' aus Eis des Herz
Mein es ernst, Chab, denn Wochen war ich eingesperrt
Laufe raus, die Kapuze auf und schieß
Denn seit Tagen ist in meiner Stadt Bambule auf der Street
Hier bei Tauben und Sehschwachen, werden Stumme dir erzählen
Von dem Tag, an dem der blaue Planet brannte

Als die schwarze Sonne kam
Wurde alles zu Staub
Sie nahmen uns alles was wir hatten
Bis auf die Haut
Als die schwarze Sonne kam
Wurde alles zu Staub
Soldaten feuerten Raketen in den Himmel hinauf
Doch nichts hielt sie auf",Schwarze Sonne,2013
Prinz Pi,"Sie sagten, dass alles nur eine Reise sei, wo nur dann mal Pause ist
In den kurzen Momenten, wo du zuhause bist
Alte Straße, heile Welt, Nachbarn sterben langsam weg
Neue Kids rauchen den gleichen Mist in der Hand versteckt
Schaukel auf dem Spielplatz schwingt,
So wie sie damals schwang an dem Abend an
Dem einer am Bahnhof sprang
Vorstadtidylle für Eltern, Hölle für Kids
Jeden Abend nach der Tagesschau das völlige Nichts
Haben, immer nur rausgewollt, reingewollt in die Stadt
Den Rolling Stone kleingemacht, eingerollt, in ein Blatt
In der S-Bahn Füße lässig auf den Sitz gefläzt
Jeder von uns denkt das gleiche „Keiner, der mich versteht
Keiner, der ist wie ich“ junge Fäuste geballt
Polnische Pyros erleuchten den Wald

Heut' ist nicht unser Tag, hast du gesagt
Das war nicht unser Jahr, ha'm wir gedacht
Doch im Rückblick war's übergut, wunderbar
Ein Song spielte den ganzen Tag, hundertmal

Heut' ist nicht unser Tag, hast du gesagt
Das war nicht unser Jahr, ha'm wir gedacht
Doch im Rückblick war's übergut, wunderbar
Ein Song spielte den ganzen Tag, hundertmal und nervte nie

Immer die gleichen Wege, die Straßen in meiner Gegend
Lieder pfeifend, gegen ewig gleiche Steine treten
Wo nie die Zeit vergeht und Partys enttäuschen
Immer Kippe schnippend da sitzen, wo sich Bahnschienen kreuzen, ah
Mit sieben Mann im Ford, angesoffen in's Nachbardorf
Die Tanke dort, Abhangort, nippen alle am Faxe-Import
Einer pumpt da wieder Bass durch seine Proll-Boxen
Russenhocke, Kreis sitzen, Pflastersteine vollrotzen
Augen mit tiefen Rändern vom miesen Weed der Händler
Weil das einzige, was gleich bleibt, ist, dass sich nie was ändert
Wieder schlendern an den Läden vorbei
Verschwende deine Jugend, alles dreht sich im Kreis

Heut' ist nicht unser Tag, hast du gesagt
Das war nicht unser Jahr, ha'm wir gedacht
Doch im Rückblick war's übergut, wunderbar
Ein Song spielte den ganzen Tag, hundertmal

Heut' ist nicht unser Tag, hast du gesagt
Das war nicht unser Jahr, ha'm wir gedacht
Doch im Rückblick war's übergut, wunderbar
Ein Song spielte den ganzen Tag, hundertmal und nervte nie

Damals an unserer Bushaltestelle
Allein mit meinen Kumpels, Schmutz und Kälte
Was wurde aus „beste Freunde für immer?“
Sind dieselben Leute heute behindert?
Wir waren mal hier, beweist die Wand
Wir haben uns mal auswendig gekannt
Wir haben den gleichen Ort im Kopf
Damals noch Kopf voll Wodka Gorbatschow
Hinter der Bude, wo wir hockten in den Sommernächten
Finger pulten Etiketten nach und nach vom Hals des Becks
Wenn die letzte Kippe wie ein einäugiger Wolf verglomm
Und unser Leben mit unseren Lieblingssongs verschwomm'
Die wir sangen bei Tag und schrien bei Nacht
Waren wir schwach, drehten wir laut und liehen uns Macht
Asche am Polo voll, CD hakt, weil verkratzt
Wolke 7, siebte Hölle, alles in einer Nacht
Waren Könige, nur mit Schnaps und Chio Chips
Was unsere Augen sahen, war größer als die Videoclips
Und die ersten Küsse sind doch noch die ehrlichsten
Jedes Mixtape, das wir machten, war unser Lebenssinn

Heut' ist nicht unser Tag, hast du gesagt
Das war nicht unser Jahr, ha'm wir gedacht
Doch im Rückblick war's übergut, wunderbar
Ein Song spielte den ganzen Tag, hundertmal

Heut' ist nicht unser Tag, hast du gesagt
Das war nicht unser Jahr, ha'm wir gedacht
Doch im Rückblick war's übergut, wunderbar
Ein Song spielte den ganzen Tag, hundertmal",100X,2013
