I see you on the street and you walk on by
You make me want to hang my head down and cry
If you gave me half a chance you'd see
My desire burning inside of me
But you choose to look the other way
I've had to work much harder than this
For something I want don't try to resist me

Open your heart to me, baby
I hold the lock and you hold the key
Open your heart to me, darlin'
I'll give you love if you, you turn the key

I think that you're afraid to look in my eyes
You look a little sad boy, I wonder why
I follow you around but you can't see
You're too wrapped up in yourself to notice
So you choose to look the other way
Well, I've got something to say
Don't try to run I can keep up with you
Nothing can stop me from trying, you've got to

Open your heart to me, baby
I hold the lock and you hold the key
Open your heart to me, darlin'

Open your heart with the key

Open your heart, I'll make you love me

With this very unpleasing sneezing and wheezing, the calliope crashed to the ground
Some all-hot half-shot was headin' for the hot spot, snappin' his fingers, clappin' his hands
And some fleshpot mascot was tied into a lover's knot with a whatnot in her hand
And now young Scott with a slingshot finally found a tender spot and throws his lover in the sand

He says, dethrone the dictaphone, hit it in its funny bone, that's where they expect it least

And some fresh-sown moonstone was messin' with his frozen zone to remind him of the feeling of romance

And little Early-Pearly came by in her curly-wurly and asked me if I needed a ride
Oh, some hazard from Harvard was skunked on beer, playin' backyard bombardier
Yes, and Scotland Yard was trying hard, they sent some dude with a calling card, he said, do what you like, but don't do it here
Well, I jumped up, turned around, spit in the air, fell on the ground and asked him which was the way back home
He said, take a right at the light, keep goin' straight until night, and then, boy, you're on your own
And now in Zanzibar, a shootin' star was ridin' in a side car, hummin' a lunar tune
Yes, and the avatar said, blow the bar but first remove the cookie jar, we're gonna teach those boys to laugh too soon
And some kidnapped handicap was complainin' that he caught the clap from some mousetrap he bought last night
Well, I unsnapped his skull cap and between his ears I saw a gap but figured he'd be all right

There was a lot of fights between the black and white
There was nothing you could do

Words were passed in a shotgun blast
Troubled times had come 
To my hometown

Now Main Street's whitewashed windows and vacant stores
Seems like there ain't nobody wants to come down here no more

And hearts of fire grow cold
We swore blood brothers against the wind
Now I'm ready to grow young again
And hear your sister's voice calling us home
Across the open yards
Well maybe we'll cut someplace of our own
With these drums and these guitars

No retreat, baby, no surrender
Blood brothers in the stormy night
With a vow to defend

The walls of my room are closing in
There's a war outside still raging
You say it ain't ours anymore to win
I want to sleep beneath
Peaceful skies in my lover's bed
With a wide open country in my eyes
And these romantic dreams in my head

Where mister when you're young
They bring you up to do like your daddy done
Me and Mary we met in high school
When she was just seventeen
We'd ride out of this valley down to where the fields were green
We'd go down to the river
And into the river we'd dive
Oh down to the river we'd ride

Then I got Mary pregnant
And man that was all she wrote
And for my nineteenth birthday I got a union card and a wedding coat
We went down to the courthouse
And the judge put it all to rest
No wedding day smiles no walk down the aisle
No flowers no wedding dress

That night we went down to the river
And into the river we'd dive
Oh down to the river we did ride, yeah yeah

I got a job working construction for the Johnstown Company
But lately there ain't been much work on account of the economy
Now all them things that seemed so important
Well Mister they vanished right into the air
Now I just act like I don't remember
Mary acts like she don't care

But I remember us riding in my brother's car
Her body tan and wet down at the reservoir
At night on them banks I'd lie awake
And pull her close just to feel each breath she'd take
Now those memories come back to haunt me
They haunt me like a curse
Is a dream a lie if it don't come true
Or is it something worse

Spend his days counting
In a garage by the motorway

He was born a pauper
To a pawn on a Christmas day
When the New York Times
Said God is dead and war's begun
Alvin Tostig has a son today

And he shall be Levon
And he shall be a good man
And he shall be Levon
In tradition with the family plan
And he shall be Levon
And he shall be a good man
He shall be Levon.

Levon's sells cartoon balloons in town
His family business thrives
Jesus blows up balloons all day 
Sits on the porch swing watching them fly
And Jesus, he wants to go to Venus
Leave Levon far behind
Take a balloon and go sailing,
While Levon, Levon slowly dies.

And he shall be Levon
And he shall be a good man
He shall be Levon",Levon [Elton John Karaoke Tribute],2012

And so I face the final curtain
My friend, I'll say it clear
I'll state my case, of which I'm certain

I've lived a life that's full
I've traveled each and every highway
Oh, and more, much more than this
I did it my way

Regrets, I've had a few
But then again, too few to mention
I did what I had to do
And saw it through without exemption

I planned each charted course
Each careful step along the byway
But more, much more than this
I did it my way

Yes, there were times, I'm sure you knew
When I bit off more than I could chew
But through it all, when there was doubt
I ate it up and spit it out
I faced it all and I stood tall
And did it my way

I've loved, I've laughed and cried
Had my fill, my share of losing
And now, as tears subside
I find it all so amusing

To think I did all that
And may I say, not in a shy way
""Oh no, oh no not me
I did it my way""

For what is a man, what has he got?
If not himself, then he has naught
To say the things he truly feels
And not the words of one who kneels

Kardinal Offishall,"I am the man who will fight for your honour
I'll be the hero that you're dreamin' of
We'll live forever, knowin' together
That we did it all for this ghetto ghetto love

I take back everything I said it don't mean nothing
Just a fight we had so many though
A ghetto love
I tell you that you gotta let me visit my son
But then you tell me no
A ghetto love
But shawty I can't take my eyes away
Even though we can't get along today
I made a promise to you that faithful day
So I say

I am the man who will fight for your honour
I'll be the hero that you're dreamin' of
We'll live forever, knowin' together
That we did it all for this ghetto ghetto love

I'm lookin' at this sexy girl from a distance
She's so damn style I'm a witness
Let me tell ya whoa
Move that thing ya whoa
Let me tell ya
And then I take her to the parking lot
Jump into my car and straight to my spot say whoa
Then she started a fight as we stepped out the club
Only cause a fan trying give me a little hug
So I say

I am the man who will fight for your honor
I'll be the hero that you're dreamin' of
We'll live forever, knowin' together
That we did it all for this ghetto ghetto love

Everybody say now
Ghetto for the ghetto for the ghetto ghetto love
Everybody say now
Ghetto for the ghetto for this ghetto love

I can't think straight when I'm on her ghetto love
With a ghetto girl, every day's a fight now
We get to war, I gotta get away while the getting is good
And get top and gone, lemme think like I know I should
But a real woman needs a little bit more than wood
She expects that from me cause she know I would
Do anything, anywhere, every time for my shorty
Even though we bicker I came right back to get her
Pull her close 'till her body says hello
This is the Kardinal and Mister Wolf Ghetto Love

I am the man who will fight for your honour
I'll be the hero that you're dreamin' of
We'll live forever, knowin' together
That we did it all for this ghetto ghetto love

Everybody say now
Ghetto for the ghetto for the ghetto ghetto love
Everybody say now
Ghetto for the ghetto for the ghetto ghetto love

And I'll fight for you until the end of time
Everybody say now
Ghetto for the ghetto

Word, Circle
Silver House And the Girl, Figure IV
Head nod, yeah y'all know

[Kardinal Offishall]
Yo that kid nice

Where the ice at?  Oh I see underground emcee
Nah, but he nice though
He flip that shit twice though, he sounding like (who?)
Nah, it a must that he bust you (fo' real)
He be eating that mic though
Ever see the way he flows and tears down the show
(Fo' real), he clever
Never sever the Ever from fresh when he spits, everything's a hit
He got skills like Mad and the Superfriends
When he does a duo, it comes out like a crew track, he's so wicked
Cooler than Ice Cube, Mack more than 10 at one time
Like Choclair he's a Virgin to the wack rhyme
It's true (fo' real)
Got a Blueprint like Thrust, said he's notorious
And watch the hit bust all over the country (fo' real)
Even on BET, ask Tigga about them niggas with that Northern Touch beat they was playing
No playing, that nigga with the afro
That's right, tight and rocks crowds all night (word)
Style like no other tall brother on your FM dial
My nigga kip-ki-kip-ki-Kardinal
You know

CHORUS [little girl singing]
He once was a thug from around the way
He once was a thug from around the way
He once was a thug from around the way
He once was a thug from around the way

[Kardinal Offishall]
Check it
A dis ain't a dis if a dis has discrepancies
I dismiss your dissidences and doubt your intelligence
And discuss how disjoint your disc
From the dispatch, a distance throw all y'all from shit that's wack
Steady disguising your disfavour, disliking my steelo
Dis ain't kindergarten, you don't have to go where we go
Discipline yourself before your ego disappears
While I discretely disassemble you from your career
Stupid!  Dis is not your ordinary rapper dis
Dis so all you niggas discover just who the dapper is
Causing discomfort, disallowing your dis-jock to rock
Any record 'cause your whole sound's flop, yo
Dis is going out to niggas who dis without
Thinking about what the hell they doing, yo your shit we're booing
Oh... while I discombobulate you
This is going out to any nigga opposing my crew
Like that

[Kardinal Offishall]
So when we singin about the girls we singin about 'di gal dem'

We talkin about 'yo, come again'

We talkin about 'dat yute's a fosse'
For the kids that think I'm comin wit it
Brother just watch me
A shoe is called a 'crep'
A big party is a 'fete'
Ya'll takin about 'watch where you goin!'
We talkin about 'mind where you step!'
We backin a 2-4 of Guinness, we ain't messin' with moet
And if you runnin out of liquor the bar might get wet
You're talkin about 'yo, that girl's hype'
We like 'she's the bundown'

We say 'clash with two sounds'
We rock the hottest things no matter how much it cost
You talkin about 'yeah son!'
We talkin about 'yo, lock it off!'

CHORUS

[Kardinal Offishall]
Yo instead of your boys

When talkin about 'your bredrin
Yo we talkin about 'your friend'
When you say 'the club is over'
Yo we say 'di jam dun'
When you're thinkin about the west, we thinkin about Red-1
Big ups and salutations to the Figure IV crew
When you're sayin 'she's a chicken'
She a 'skettlebam too!'
When you talkin about a 'thug nigga'
We talkin about a 'shotta'
When you think you got it locked, T dot comin much hotta
You think we all Jamacian, when nuff man are Trini's
Bajans, Grenadians and a hole heap of Haitians
Guyanese and all of the West Indies combined
To make the T dot O dot, one of a kind
Irs said 'we burn kahn' that mean 'they puff lah'
When we say 'hell no', that means you 'dat nuh mek it'
Look me in the eye and tell me y'all ain't sold
My style is off the thermostat plus I'm comin from the cold-yo

CHORUS X2",Bakardi Slang,2001
Kardinal Offishall,"If everyone could see just how I see
They'd function like a G'
And walk that big walk in the streets

If everyone could see just how I see
They'd function like a G'
And walk that big walk in the streets, in the streets

My God it's a beautiful day to just sit and enjoy blue skies
And all the brothers in the streets gettin' high
Give thanks for your life because yo things will change
Ghetto people suffering will soon in-herit the game

The last will come first and the first will come last
And the good will take a seat in the holiest of mass
And blast out the world sin, hard times we living in
I am trying to do the best I can living with my breddrens

The world is filled with negative and positive
Never judge a man what he is is what he is
And I am an ill bro blessed with an ill flow
With an opportunity to rep the T-dot O

And try to spread some of the blessings, lyrical dressings
And I am guessing that your listening to what I am addressing
Especially since I'm rhymiing from my heart
Trying to supress the craziness before it even starts

Yo every gun man has to have a soft spot
Every thug nigga has gotta have some heart
It's these things that I hold to be true
So I don't have to pray that they won't blast you

If everyone could see just how I see
They'd function like a G'
And walk that big walk in the streets

If everyone could see just how I see
They'd function like a G'
And walk that big walk in the streets, in the streets

Yo, I was touched by the real the other day
If my pops was here he would tell me enjoy every single day
And support your family 'cause blood comes first for real
Nevermind about trying to sign a deal

Just do what you gotta do and do it like the best
Even when it seems that people C-Bn' for no reason
Don't study the treason, function like a G'
And with that, the world is ready steady f-ing with me

Admiring who I be, I take it as flattery
I must exemplify just what it is to be an emcee
I breathe in the tragedy and breathe out a song of hope
Free from government, politics, lies, plus the Pope

The 5.0 sells dope, police make nuff sales
We're taken out of the hood and locked up with no bail
But either way we get out and try to turn it around
You can't see it but you feel it in the sound, you know dat

If everyone could see just how I see
They'd function like a G'
And walk that big walk in the streets

If everyone could see just how I see
They'd function like a G'
And walk that big walk in the streets, in the streets

If everyone could see just how I see
They'd function like a G'
And walk that big walk in the streets

If everyone could see just how I see
They'd function like a G'
And walk that big walk in the streets, in the streets

I'm not a reverend, a preacher, V.P. or teacher
But still I gotta reach and none can impeach
But the most high spiritual, virtually physical
Higher power more than capable to make miracle

In every black home and in every jail cell
And in everyone of us to let the righteous set sail
And accept positioning, whether you a Christian
A Jew, or Muslim, yo have faith in him

The G's in the street know what I'm talking about
The man dem on the corner, surviving with no doubt
The kids in the park trying to keep things real
Yo, who don't hear muss feel? You know that

If everyone could see just how I see
They'd function like a G'
And walk that big walk in the streets

If everyone could see just how I see
They'd function like a G'
And walk that big walk in the streets, in the streets

If everyone could see just how I see
They'd function like a G'
And walk that big walk in the streets

If everyone could see just how I see
They'd function like a G'
And walk that big walk in the streets, in the streets

If everyone could see just how I see
They'd function like a G'
And walk that big walk in the streets

If everyone could see just how I see
They'd function like a G'
And walk that big walk in the streets, in the streets

Kardinal Offishall,"[Kardinal Offishall]
Alright
Yo, I'm bust
I'mma kill it, I'mma kill it
Here we go here we go
Yo
My flow is like a cock block for your whole label street team
My verse is like a hearse for your marketing scheme
My whole steez nigga please, put the mic down
Talking 'bout you represent, when you embarrassing your town
Walking around with the Gay Pride parade crown
Silicone raps underneath that pink gown
Posing as a killer when you living as a clown
Entertaining A&R's too deaf to hear the sound
You a has-been rapper, talking 'bout your style's nice
Saying I'm independent now, looking for a new life
A weak DJ, living off of 80's fame
Guess starring in the Basement, living off of Tigga's name
My name's Kardinal, the pearl mic dark figure
Diploma type thoughts mixed up with street niggas
Living underground trying to earn the pop loot
'Cause I won't sell crack and got no aim to shoot
No patience for the weed, not quick enough to tief
Can't pimp, don't like fur coats or gold teeth
But I can rock the hell out of a fat ass beat
I might smile, up in your face and then jack your S-P

CHORUS 1 [Kardinal Offishall] {CMD}
Yo, I'm ill to the 7th degree
T-dot represent, ya hearing me
{Go ahead den}
Yo, I'm the nicest rapper dapper
With flows you don't know, how a firestarter go
{Go ahead den}
Yo, lick two, chart off in the sky
A make way when I'm stepping in the room
{Go ahead den}
Yo eff rappers, I'm the hardest thing on two feet
Yo, listen to me, ya not zeen
{Well go ahead den}

[Kardinal Offishall]
Yo, my rhymes are FedEx covered in latex
Delivered to your Jubby, my charms tribes quest for hot sex
No bust for the next can protect
It's when the I drop, the niggas saying 'what?'
And the skins are saying wet wet wet wet wet
I'm dripping in 'nuff girls, and missing what we trying to say
But talking about a revolution, end up talking about the day
When they can feel a rapper's privates, I'm looking for your mind
But I'm seeing all your titties and a big round behind
Oh damn girl, you make think 'bout selling out
But oops, your weave just fell out
Ha ha
I'm straight from the place that first brought you Vince Carter
The story of Hurricane, and imported sugar cane
And snappy pop coming out three for a dollar
What, Peter loves who?  Yo don't bother to hail it up
In the streets where we meet 'cause you might get beat
And find your head caught between timbos and concrete
And that's real, a lot of ignorant peeps around the way
Ain't trying to bend over to the madness of the day
But do what to do and yo who am I to say
I just want your records sales anyway
You see me

CHORUS 2 [Kardinal Offishall] {CMD}
Someone kill to try and come up with the things that I say
I'm a bad mother-yo
{Go ahead den}
I'm too fresh like Guess-V, in a special way (special way)
But everyday
{Go ahead den}
  ""It's no way we can rock after them""

I ain't spittin', I hock a luggy
This ain't no motherfu---- verse, I write movies
Picture this, how a nigga get sicker than itchy syphilis
Burn radio waves 'til I hit your bitch Christmas list
Ha, I drop rocks like a fifty cent piece from Terror's twenty
Aimed at your Bentley son
Number one when my shard be blast
Mix with hash, made your heart beat fast

Back at your ass in full flash
Come to mash every last class of (emcee)
Pass the baton when I get on
And go on until I got it on
Spark it up and inhale this (emcee)
Masterly, masterfully I be the (emcee)
So many can't rock the mic, so they hold the glock tight
And I give thanks I wasn't born a sucker
Pucker for this hard fist lyricist
'Nuff butter like BBJ's grocery list

[Saukrates]
Yo, hoes be this hoes be that
Bet if I flash this watch my nigga, that hoe be back
And I ain't even rocking a Rolly or fronting with cash
I'm at the bar with George Costanza arguing for tax
The first to let you know, get some flood insurance
It ain't a rare occurrence when I overflow
You'll be backstrokin' from Alaska to Oakland
When me and my Circle be in a yacht... (floating) *echo*

No matter give me no daps nigga, I ain't trying to please you
Want to flow with me, can't afford the fees duke
Claiming street raps when Jeff Healey could see through
Your wonder bra rah rah, {garbage like bad pot}
Go ahead like punk trick and watch where you land
I'm a shady black slim, you a nigga I can't stand
Move! kid, this some celebrity next shit
Step up and watch the next celebrity hanging by they necklace
Peasants! Think about what you getting into
We hardcore, bump those little fist fights we've been through
We done did it, never mind can or can do
We trying to make it easier for our fam to Land Cruise
You sell the same weed at the same spot
We graduated to the high grade lyrics pon cock

[Saukrates] {Kardinal}
I've been autobahn rhyme ever since primetime
Saw George and Wheezy sipping on fine wine
The ghetto scream {rewind} like daylight savings time
Bring it back, firing legal hollows out the Ac'
{Who's that?} MC's of leisure, Sauk and Kardinal
We bring the ebony stone, now watch me carve it out
Bump my shit in tenement housing
It's a vocal revolution for 2000... ""1!""

So bitch freeze, your motivation evident
Rhymes milky, chocolate has heaven sent

And presidents and crack heads smoking too close to the residence

From an African, straight to a nigger, you know what I'm saying
We traveling over to what, to what
Negro, and then we went to what
Then we went to black
Then it was on some Afro-American stuff

Walkin through the uptown a black man (nigga)
Walkin down Yonge St. a black man (nigga)
Walkin through Flatbush a black man (nigga)
When the revolution comes I got a finger on the trigga
I was born a regular man of the Earth
With a curse to walk like a soldier since birth
My exterior is shaded in by my melanin
Stereotype of my type is a felon
My people cause static cause automatically now a days we fire automatics
Grammatically adequate my people come equipped
With enough lyrics to move battleships
Blood brother ever since the slave ships
It doesn't matter who I am when I walk by
They still see me as a nigga whine I walk by
That's O.K. - this nigga will play the role and 
come again and take back the Earth another day

Walkin through Rexdale a black man (nigga)
Strollin through Dectaur as a black man (nigga)

For the thickness I got a love jones
I like my girls with the nappy dug out hips and chest buss out
Lips real full, gettin ready to cuss out
Parasuco gettin insulated by the structure
Body so powered that the labels be stickin out in 3-D
We salute the ladies - raped over time pushin out light babies
The slave masters with the devil in their eye
Saw nothin but a nigga when you walked by
But you the mother of creation
Let's bring back the family aspect and try to build a strong nation

Soft rock?  Or hard rock?

It's full time, now you come off on dat range
My name's Wio, bareback rhyming in the plains

Blessin' this, effortless, mess with this, eff with this
If you think you got a chance to dance with your devilish messages
Stressing this can only lead to battery
You rattle me, request to battle me I take as flattery
I see ya, grip your bible,I'm the lyrically homicidal idol
Who's liable to take your title with a single recital, it's vital
You respect the steez, I get vexed with ease
Don't make me ask you to respect me please

Imaginary gats busting just don't faze me
Lick a shot, wave your flag, gunfinga in the air

Get yanked like a glock trigger, just to make the plot thicker

You must think it's me that make that nigga act so

My vision is an ism (yo) smoke it till you're high
Unattainable goals blank to your third eye (yo)

Black is for Black, they can't understand that
So they call it ""reverse racism"" and try to pin it back (yo)
But if we ain't for us, who for us? them? - nah!
If it was up to them they would have us ridin' in the back of the bus
In handcuffs and other shackles (yo) check Mr. Bush
Plant cocaine on me and call it operation push
Our Prime Minister is actually second in command
Bending over to the star spangled-politically strangled
So we have to move (yo) through the underground
Encode the funk mode and claim back the sound (yo)

Off the top and all that

Cameras are watching you, they watching you from birth
And they be killing us softly by biologically attacking us first

Dear Lord,
I really, I don't even know how to ax this
You know, I can't, this this this is not an act
I must, from the bottom of my heart, ask forgiveness for my sins
But you know what
I ask that you give me the strength to be able to reach 
all of those peoples, on every street corner, every block, every ghetto
All of those people, that we sometimes think are not worthy of blessings, 
they're worthy to me
And I think that as a man given the blessings you have given me
The opportunity to speak, that I need to speak the language 
of those people, and I need to reach them
You know, because there's are a lot of good people on this Earth, 
but there still some people that need a talking to
And I ask you to give me the strength to reach out to those people
You know because I believe everybody is worthy of your blessings
So I ask that you give, you give me, my family, my crew, F.O.S, the circle
All of us, all the babies that are being born
You give us the strength to be able to deal with it how you see fit
because you give all of us the power, as much as some people might not believe it
You give us the strength to reach out and touch a lot people
So Lord I ask you give me the strength to go out in the world and start the fire
You know, start your fire, you understand I'm saying
Lord, just please be with me, be with me 
and give me the strength and let me do this

Well I'm on a mission
Van Gogh your ass, so y'all listen
Nigga, there ain't no fire if we don't start the ignition
Throw some bullets at your feet
Show you what ya missing, listen I hope for black love without wishing
I murder the track and go neck to neck without kissing
I'm ducking from the wack flows, calling it dis-missing
Big money in the hook, cats is loot fishing
Nigga's adding ones like they was mathematicians
Four plus y'all equals more without addition, listen
Cooking up plans in a da kitchen
Too many chefs leads to nuff cats bitching
Love in a we face behin' we back yuh teet' kissin
Whether you're garbage or not is not my decision
Before you check it deep, you have to make the incision
Nuff cats are slated for great things
But if yuh nuh lick shot for love
Well den murda we bring

Filling the track with hot lead without bussin'
No discussion nigga talk without fussing
But F---, I ain't answering another damn question

Freaking the three bands of frequencies, frequently
I frequently gather frequent flyer miles
I be freaking the same chick that you're admiring
The same G, ask them niggas around me
The P maybe free, but my tracks cost money
I might talk funny, but this nigga is no dummy
Now cough up my dough before I have to call Sunny
Switch switchblades, to switch hand grenades
I switch when a bitch nigga misses my payday

Your outside is smiling, but what's your intention
F a judge and stil get an honourable mention
Tell ya peace and love without both my fists clenching
Raps with real flows real re-invention
Chat on wicked tracks, add new dimensions
New cliques, gang bang causing old tensions
Niggas in the streets with swords like street fencing
For these record labels nuff rap cats is Benson
From these old street cats, I took a lesson
Never like groupie hoes hanging in my session
Rolling over weak cats in one succession
Who's up next, we got nuff headz guessing

She used to roll with my family to J-A
VA, SC and even GA
I used to spend her in Dectaur in the dai-ly
Visiting my aun-tie, we went world wide
She met every single girl I had, no lie
And then one of my ex-girls brought me to the side and said
M-Jane is tearing up my insides
Couldn't hear that, I need to run my life
I'm like the big King and she like my Queen wife
She done looks good in denim, better in leather
Just right in linen, and so fine in good weather
In the summertime, she on my ass
At the barbeques, buying me a drink without asking
When she with me, she be looking out for me simple and plain
My homegirl Money Jane
CHORUS
[Sean Paul]
She get around, she get around a lot
Alright check it out, she bust on the spot
She get around, she get around a lot
From Paris to New York, and she come back
She get around, she move around a lot
Alright check it out, she bust on the spot
She get around, she move around a lot
From Kingston JA, right up to T-dot
Upon the level, funny how we only know that
And a dull life, when she run out we love circles
Funny we run every where
But when it in the door, that time we return up on the rebel
Only buy the food from the FoodMart
Antagonist start, how do you know we live confortable
Only meant the gun them bust out
And people in New York how you done know someone?

Ayo
Everybody needs her simple and plain
My homegirl Money Jane

Everybody needs her simple and plain

Bullets to your brain like aspirin, the art of war we did master it
We got arms like George Bush, heart like Bin Laden
Projects and schemes of Jamaican we been trodin
Murder, extortion, kidnappin', bribery, drug money launderin', 
Alice and Steve keep wonderin'
How some pussy can't move we, we shoot like a video or a movie
Bloodbath no, blood jacuzzi
Beretta, calico, Uzi, make big man a scream like Susie

So where I rest I'm stressed by the 5-0 (here we go)
Cops drive around the turf, lookin' for someone to search
With they flashlights checkin' in my dashboard
(whatchu lookin' for?)
Or lookin' for the heat stashed under the seat
But I'm a rudebwoy, plus everything is legit (you knew it)
Worked too damn hard for my things (that's right)
I'm a celeb, I heard +99 problems+
But understand that every rudebwoy is a king
So we watched, no face, and just play along
Everything I own's bling to the ding (dun'know)
Them niggas think they have me shook but they dead wrong
Them pigs vexed kardi youth have a little bit of fame
Didn't find nothin', so they screw-faced
Plus I never ever once lost my cool (no way!)
It's just a story of an everyday black man
Give thanks that the beast never pulled out they tools

I am an everyday, an everyday rudebwoy,
I'm an everyday rudebwoy, I'm an everyday rudebwoy

I used to check this girl off in the west set
Had a baby girl by some dude
I used to hear second-hand from her brethren
That the youth was vexed, ""yo kardinal I need food""
I used to hang with the girl every now and then
First met her chillin' out at the club
Body bangin' like she was in king magazine
Chopped her still, even though I wasn't rollin' on dubs
She used to live in the middle of the ghetto
Chickens yellin' on the block in the hood
Sometimes I used to hear the shots bellow
But they respect what I'm doin', so you know it's all good
So as I'm rollin' off, the baby father rollin' out
The youth lookin' at me dead in my eye
I said ""you should have stuck it out with your family
But now that's girl's mean, so don't screw-face me!""

Kardinal Offishall,"It's eight o'clock here in kingston, jamaica
The kingston police have issued an apb
Out for wanted criminal rostacious johnson
He has last been seen headed towards
The united states of america or canada
If you have any info please call us right away

[Chorus]
I was a gangsta,
Livin' my life hustlin' on the block, with no food to eat
Rollin' with them prankstas
Settin' the streets on fire with the heat
I had no choice as a gangsta,
Livin' my life hustlin' on the block, with no food to eat
Rollin' with them prankstas
Settin' the streets on fire with the heat

Aiyyo, stepped off the edge of 'maica at the age of ten
Landed at the dot airport, comin' out of may pen
Raised by his grandmama, until his real mama
Could send for the youth, and reunite, aiight
So now he's growin' up exposed to the ghetto limelight
No pops (nope) plus his moms got to work nights
Moonlightin' as a janitor, to make bread for the two
All the while he's growin' up, runnin' with a crew
It started off tryin' to make a little extra creamer
But then it turned to pushin' rocks, savin' for the beamer
Told his moms he got a job workin' in the trade
At a local grease monkey, that's how he's gettin' paid
And that's how he got the deal on the black man wagon
Moms thought it was suspect, but she's still braggin'
To her kin about ""how he come home and grow right""
All the while he's wildin' out, money starts pilin' now
The next crew saw the flex and start red eye
Jealous of the way them niggas hustle,
Til he get a little muscle, uh huh, bust a bunch of shots
There my nigga laid, really holdin' down the block
That nigga gangsta

[Chorus]

Hey yo, six weeks in intensive, holdin' on to prayers
On the seventh, he was back on his back in the west wing
His man done came visiting, in his ear whispering
How the block was hot, and there was 'nuff shots whistling
Another week and he was back on his feet
Discharged, ready to get back and hit the street
Moms was still working overtime, clueless to the real
About how his son was livin' in the hood packin' steel
Pushin' coke no joke them cats wanted retaliation
Word got back, about who led the slaughter
One nigga named blaka, real name elroy
Next day (boom) what happened to that boy
For the next three months my man stayed on the low
Told his moms he wasn't workin' cause the garage was slow
But just as he tried to resurface on the strip
Someone on the turf called 222-tips

[Chorus]

Now my man locked up, and had to sweat inside a jail
Cause his man done fled the scene, and moms couldn't afford bail
The trial came and went, his mother cried ""discrimination!""
Said the judge didn't know her son
He said he knew him too well, he'd seen him there before
Turned the cheek cryin', now he feels he's on fire
Got burned by the same liquor, quit talkin' fresh
He doesn't know how to act, so now he got to go back
My man got dipped, sent right back to may pen
Grandma didn't want him, now family wouldn't take him
He thought about work, but he said ""f that!""
He got a fake passport and just came right back

[Chorus: x2]

Yeah, black jays! oh what?

Yo, all the shuckin' and jivin' is over
I'm the chosen soldier, cold shoulder
Your home boys told ya, flip your flows
I fold, you can fertilize with the bs they sold ya
I need papers for the style that I loaned ya
Everybody's talkin' about they gettin' busy, why don't ya?
Weak players in the game steady gettin' over
I'm one of a kind, like side gills on a rover
First name jay, but ain't similar to hova

My shine is incredible, versus a solar
I'm sick like a seven-day-strain of ebola
I'm here! yeah, nigga!

(one more time)
No doubt, when we on the block
Because my niggas came ready to rock, boy

Step heavy like a lion through the jungle
I'm lyin' if I told you that I wasn't raised humble
I'm tryin', but I stumble, I try not to mumble
So you can hear it loud stupid (let's get ready to rumble)
I'll serve you son, like I'm supposed to
The only way I'm bi, is when I'm flyin' bicoastal
Or buyin' fly wears, nike airs like most do
I'm hotter, than the hotter, than the hotter, I'll roast you
Got a good habit of doin' what you won't do
Stop playin' girl, you know I ain't phoned you
Check one of them suckers, you know that they want you
I'm loco with the vocals, most dudes just local
I'm here! yeah, nigga!

Yo, rudeboys move in silence
Don't want to hustle until they hear sirens
I'm tryin' to be inspirin'
But my 6'4"", 220 has a lot of them kids perspirin'
'nuff dudes firin', too many gettin' shot
So swallow your pride nigga, check whoever is hirin'
The paper gangstas is who I'm admirin'
Those who get paper alive, and still smilin'
Y'all stay wildin', I'm tryin' to go the mile and
I'm rough enough to break new york from long island

Pick up the pace, and put down the crack vial

Hey yo, actions speak louder than words
My middle finger speaks louder than yours
I'm in the hood, feet poundin' the curb
Jealous of nothin', mine is bigger than yours
Standin' still, y'all runnin' with herbs
I stole the soul motherfucker, I ain't bringin' it back
Whack niggas like Jamsport, holdin' me back
And I don't care if you're friends with Jay
Or Dre, or Kay Slay, you're still garbage
Learn to parlay, before you look this way
I'm heinous with mine, Kardinal made this
I don't pay to get on any playlist
Niggas in the street was waitin' for someone to say this
I ain't suckin' dick for y'all DJ's to play this (let 'em know)

Look at me wrong, and say what's up to Sammy Davis
I'm heavy nigga, the biggest libra couldn't weigh this
Before you kiss your TV, you should kiss my whole anus

At all costs I'm doin' it the fly way
So I never say que sera sera

I got the most superior mainframe in the game
Flows like a fifty-paper, ain't a damn thing changed
On the mic I'm deranged, off the mic I'm just crazy
Spit-shine my letter combos, that's what pays me
In other words it's the nouns and the verbs
That buys the X5's and the cribs on the lakesides
I run this shit, I don't take sides
What you see is what you get, most of these rappers are in disguise
With no persona, so they diss guys
You want to lose your profession? I suggest you test this guy
The best buy in any Best Buy
I'll straight burn the place down like a throwback Left Eye
Ahead of the class, nobody ever left I
I'm so right, I can't even open my left eye
You're dead wrong, tryin' to correct I
I'm like the dead in one way: no choice but to respect I, yeah!

Yo, everything I do is strong when I rap
I don't bust no verses, I talk in thunder claps
Give black hands daps, and X marks the map
Dot city on my chest, show the world where I'm at
Lift you higher than a three hundred dollar weed pack
And a G4 smuggled in my jacket in the back
Yeah, some question my heart and dedication
Why? I'm into the pulse like a palpitation
Some man dem dat I know hold down the +Big Macs+
And they come and watch you air the beef out (Blak, blak)
That ain't me though, I'm regal like a pharaoh and them

Kardinal Offishall,"I remember when
I remember, I remember when I lost my mind
There was something so pleasant about that place
Even your emotions have an echo in so much space

And when you're out there, without care
Yeah I was out of touch
But it wasn't because I didn't know enough
I just knew too much

Does that make me crazy?
Does that make me crazy?
Does that make me crazy?
Possibly

And now that you are having the time of your life
Think twice
That's my only advice

Come on now, who do you
Who do you, who do you
Who do you think you are?
Ha ha ha, bless your soul
You really think you're in control?
Well

I think you're crazy
I think you're crazy
I think you're crazy
Just like me

My heroes had the heart
To lose their lives out on a limb
And all I remember, is thinking
I wanna be like them
Mm hmm ever since I was little
Ever since I was little it looked like fun
And it's no coincidence I've come
And I can die when I'm done

Maybe I'm crazy
Maybe you're crazy
Maybe we're crazy
Probably

Southeast to Pennsylvania, Transportation Authority 
Is what I'm probably on, if I ain't whippin' a Land 
Throughout ya section; my mind's in traum' 
Nine times out of time I rhymes upon the L-Train 
Within my brain, fountains over rugged mountains 
Of my terrain; dig it; I came too far to front 
So I'm meditatin' on how to maintain 
Stepped off at City Hall into the rain
And ran into my nigga named Dane, I mean, Hakeem 
And we was buildin' on how we could organize the team 
For this capital gain bein' that we in the rap game 
It's time to have it all; he said he figured he same 
We realized this a planet of cream to obtain 
When the predominant rap, conglomerate rap spark the flame 
Hark the name, the fifth from the Ill-Power Hill at that 
He dropped me off within the streets of South Phil' 
Where niggas think that killing's living real 
Shorty's is getting wetted, fulfilling their fantasies to set it 
We don't sweat it, by the fifth you get beheaded 
I pivot through my borough givin' pounds to the dreaded 
At the lye spots I got credit; could run 'em down 
In alphabetical order it's sorta pathetic 
Yo, I'm livin' life within a labyrinth of nonsense 
This is a consequence of being Philly residents

Up ya lighter 'fore we spark; check it out

I walk through this field with criminals 
Ill, die-hard soldiers try to make it towards the generals 
Hard-headed, rugged captains walkin' head on through action 
Turnkeys on the closed caption 
I bring the skills of wizardry 
Treat emcees with bigotry, so now you see the picture vividly 
Seduce your brain from the temple over instrumentals 
The fifth chant; you see the exhaust out 
The swift camp mannerism is to scan your vision 
You see the light; you can't eclipse the sun 
We call back the young, but still they'll strap a gun 
To shoot caps that spook cats and rappers hung 
Now you might tube across from the diners where you find 'em lost 
Niggas hearts so cold, they sport frost 
The M-the-ilitant, the Bad Lieutenant kill your camp 
You're now a victim of reality, my personality 
Afflicted, for three to five if convicted 
Illicit, because most cats will live corrupted 
It ain't no pity in this; inner-city niggas fuckin'

Up ya lighter 'fore we spark; check it out

Inclined to rap about facts; I never fake jacks 
Shit is real like E-packs, forty fifty-sixes 
Trims and gimmicks couldn't faze the true heartache 
When I first started, but then few remember this 
Anti-gangsta bitch, sporting new jewels 
Plain Jane styles internal to the naked eye 
Derived from mind states of Cold Crush tapes 
And beat breaks seduced by means to elevate 
Equates my views with the passing 
Those matching this intellect identify, for like minds 
Intertwine one thought in unison

Lil Flip the Leprechaun, Slim Thug the Boss Hogg
Fin to put it all in why'all face

I bought a new Lac and put it on chrome, without touching my stash
Like Lil Flip I can do that, Excursion candy blue tha?
Twenty two that, pounds of dro I done blew that
You should of knew that, the Slim Thug gon' shine
My ear rings cost a dime, I read Rolex Times
I'm top of the line, you can tell when I open my mouth
I bet nobody got mo' princess cut teeth, than the Boss
Open your mouth up you lost, I'm blinding these boys
I'm joining rocks in your blocks, in candy blue toys
Talking noise, 'cause I ain't old enough to drank
But I got mo' cash to last, than your daddy in the bank
I'm top rank, Slim Thug gon' talk the talk
Walk the walk, we can bet ball for ball
We some paid young G's, with too much cash
Too much flow and do', talking too much trash ha

We got too much money, too much cash
All why'all haters, can kiss our ass

Too much money is what I got, like Scarface I rap a lot
S-Type Jag straight off the lot, believe me dog I'm really hot
I'm swanging four's and thinking thoed, banging hoes and changing clothes
Smoking dro and doing shows, paper stack can never fold
I bought the car and I bought the house, I represent the Dirty South
Got more syrup than Waffle House, run through hoes like Marshall Faulk
I talk the talk and walk the walk, 'cause nigga I'm a G
Lil Flip is who I be, I know your gal know me
'Cause I wear a Roley, that look like a snowman
And I push a Jag, you just gotta see it man
I'm sitting on Dubs, kinda like a blank tape
You see them rocks in my teeth, ain't none of em fake
Give me a break, you think I'm lying or something
I'm at the mall with your hoe, and she buying me something
I'm a young pimp, with a whole lot of cash
And why'all haters, why'all can kiss our ass

[Chorus: Repeat 2X]

I got too much M-O-N-E-why
Anything I S-E-E, I be	-you-why
Pull a Bentley off the lot, and ran that thang in the wall
We throw Crys in the air laugh, and watch it fall
Watch me ball, as the Dub spin like a top
I got crunk when I stopped, and made my pop trunk wop
Girls bop, automatic cause I'm top of the line
I cut my beep past six, and I raise the top of your spine
I'ma shine, Sucka Free, Boss Hogg in a row
You can catch me fresh and braided, or rugged and fro
You see the Spre's on the car, I bet you my people like the rock
When girls see Tite, Flip and Slim they say... pulling cameras out
Damn I'm hot, when I hit the club I'm bound to line to the bar
And for the first hundred people, I'm insuring they car
Attracting your star, cause nigga my piece attracting your car
We got too much green, and that's real by far

Kardinal Offishall,"I see your dirty face hide behind your collar. 
What is done in vain, truth is hard to swallow.
So you pray to God to justify the way
You live a lie, live a lie, live a lie.

And you take your time.
And you do your crime.
Well you made your bed.
I'm in mine.

Because when I arrive, 
I-I bring the fire.
Make you come alive,
I can take you higher.
What this is?
Forgot?
I must now remind you.
Let it rock, let it rock, let it rock.

Now the son's disgraced, he who knew his father.
When he cursed his name, turned and chased the dollar.
But it broke his heart so he stuck his middle finger
To the world, to the world, to the world.

And you take your time.
And you stand in line
Where you'll get what's yours,
I got mine.

Because when I arrive,
I-I bring the fire.
Make you come alive,
I can take you higher.

I must now remind you.
Let it rock, let it rock, let it rock.

Yeah!

Me-chanic me, I can fix ya up.
I can dick ya up,

Shorty we can go where ever,
Just pick a town.
And my jewelry is louder than the engine sound.
Big ass rocks like on the ground,
Dirty like sex that's on the ground.
Weezy.

It's like speeding down the highway
With a blind fold on
No hands on the wheel
Hopin' God will lead me my way
And I know he real
So my grandma say what I
Feel a sweat from the sun
Cause I work construction
I gotta take care of my son
I got one in the oven on the way
Rents late, two months
Cause my land lord talks too much

Hands full of calises
And I still got the magic touch to make wife blush
I been workin' it out since a high school crush
Fix on the clutch
Minds on my money
But my money ain't there
But I will not resort to welfare I care
Can't stop
Won't stop

I could really use a favour
Could I get it tonight?

No
Christmas here
I'm taking time and a half
Gotta make that cash
Even if a nigga gotta drive that cab
I'm gonna treat it like a limo
Didn't know? y'better ask
Somebody told me
Closed mouths don't eat
Closed eyes may never ever see
So I try with everything I've got to not sleep
But it's hard to run if at first you don't creep
After work take the long way home
See a lotta whips stick out in chrome
Thinkin' about a house but I can't get along
So I day dream on my way back to my zone
Thinkin' about my son look when he full grown
Will he be raised right or another street clone?
Everything I know God knows gotta shown
Lettim know he is not alone
He on

I can't stop 'til my suits are tailored
Well
I really can't trust my neighbours
Some
Only trust in the Lord to save me
I
Gotta believe in the fact
That he must want better for us
Like young C gotta do it for us
My car broke down
Fuck the bus
Fuck the million
Fuck the city laws are unjust
It's like why do I try
When I feel I'm gonna die
Without a tear left in my eye?
I work the hard to see the lease
It's like cultivating the harvest
Not seeing the feast
I don't wanna get philosophical go-to deed
I have faith but I'm afraid to take the lead
Most of what I know
I know holds me back
Instead of learning
I want that lack

You know I'm not into that shit?
Right?

Some of my friends are terrorists
Some of my friends deal crack and I am not OK with this
Some niggas I know only back me because I rake dough like a Gardner
And fuck it I work harder
I don't like most hip hop out
There's a secret society of niggas who wanna shout
""turn that bullshit off!""
I should shut my mouth?
Next thing you know I ain't welcome down south
Of the border
I don't believe in turfs or a section
I believe in community
Where anybody can walk good without protection
I believe that Dyla was the numba one dude in rap
But there on the slaps of haikus
I spite you for not givin' it up
Fuck what that nigga say, nigga give it up

Why black people act like little kids?
Make mad excuses when they know what it is
Be like them white folks invest that shit
Instead niggas clownin' on the red carpet
Showing my niece that a million on the neck
Is the hot shit
Is bloodclated disrespect
And growin' up poor don't make you ignant
Act your age
Don't act your pigment
Race to the top
Don't let your race stop you
From revolution
Open your mouth and bust shots

Family proud of me so I don't need your validity
Tongue change the ecosystem, flood it with humidity
Hot, second guessing me is just stupidity
You don't have no credit much less any credibility
Liar, lie down you're just a liability
Don't need them new friends with unpredictability
Falsing on my business find a piss in your vicinity
Konvict conquering your conscious facility
Watch me prophesize for a piece of the profitability
Doin' this my only disabilititity

I am an alien
I'm an ilegal alien
I'm a rude boy with rude boy talk
I'm an alien
Sometimes I feel like an alien
I'm a rude boy that's from T Dot

I approach my life with a certain sensibility
Tell it like it is I don't cover with gentility
Hand full of fam so we move with mobility
Hand full of grands so there is no availability
Livin' with no sin is an impossibility 
But don't let the good life cloud your visibility
Lettin' me in the game was an inevitability
Don't follow them cats with no identity
Kardinal steppin' up on your territory
See me civil or wrestle you inside the cemetary
Looking up, don't believe in luck, I believe in love
And you get stung, if you stop me before my time done
Associate of Cannon the son of a big gun
African at heart when I do my bank run
My man Chuck D said my Uzi weighs a ton
Heavy thoughts weigh nothing, each one teach one

I am an alien
I'm an ilegal alien
I'm a rude boy with rude boy talk
I'm an alien
Sometimes I feel like an alien
I'm a rude boy that's from T Dot

Huh, dangerous bustin' every hater caught the vapors
I don't watch no face bredren let's get papers
I call it a fade Kobe oh call it a taper
Feelin' like Al Capone goin' on a caper
Never would I harm a girl never even drape her
Let my sister treat her like Chris Rock and shake her
Mayday, mayday, Mr. Morgan break her break her
We get money in an instant like shareholders of Quaker
Just a trouble joiner I am not a trouble maker
From the days of the real sweet love Anita Baker
I'd rather have a real home sittin' on an acre than
Owing about a hundred grand to my jewelry maker
Kardinal call me the immigrant translator
Or the poor people's permanent position vindicator

I don't take my chain off on the mics
My security piece
It gives me security (security)
I'm waiting for the ghetto to secure me
I just put away thirty percent for my taxes
Twenty for the feds, the rest under my mattress Huh
I gave my wallet a botox injection
A bunch 'a rude boyz in'a your section
Tryin' to give my tax bracket an erection

If you can smell my cologne, you're too close

Cause the roof's On and Off's Like They In and Out Of Their Minds
Eggshell pale ti-da-tota on the scale
The old nine's is out and I ain't waiting on a deal
The same time the motherfuckers bargaining and lawyering
That coke money just keep pouring in and pouring in
Quarter mil bling-bling, that's the price of fame, lame
I should have a title and a D.E on the chain man

Stir it till it's hard, Pop it out, let it dry slow

I remove the roof as if it's a toupe
To shed light on the jewels, Glue on blu-ray
High definition
I get cash two-twenty on the dash and a self start ignition
Tola don't love me but she keep insisting
Brain so good it's hard to keep my distance

Nose in the air I smell a Chanel platinum
Re-Up is the Gang, I rep with a passion
Till the wheels fall off and It all Come crashing

Nothing like money make a bitch loose her blouse
Well done homie, we rich take a bow.

Don't tell me you love me just cause you in the mood,

It's only for you my baby,

So when you say that you love me do you really understand?
Cause lovin' ain't just about touchin' and holding hands.

It's a spiritual thing that,
Really really hard so baby,
So don't gimme no lies if you really wanna be my man.

My love is so magnificent baby,
If you really real come take it.
My love is so magnificent baby,
If you really, if you really

You ain't gonna be the one to tell me how much I'm worth,
Cause I pulled myself out up from under the dirt,

You have got to believe me,
What I have don't come easy,
And if your ready like I'm ready then you gotta put in the work.
Now you know I'm the realist chick you've been waiting a while,
And I ain't dealin' with no Harvard boy cause he makes me smile,

Cause you gotta step your game up,
This is what I call a wake cause,
You can take it to the left because I'll always be the style,

Keep on your heels, lets get down to business,
No gym but i'm seein' your fitness,
With my eyes closed you pose as a witness,
Everywhere the body language you pronounce

You call me up because you know I’ll be there

I see your true colours shining through
I see your true colours, that’s why I love you
So don’t be afraid to let them show your true colours
True colours are beautiful (Cheer up!) like a rainbow

I see your colours though they appear to be different
You should never be afraid because your difference is the difference
We live in a time where to be yourself is hard
And the way you really feel can leave you emotional scar
But stay strong, stay firm and never back down
Being yourself is the only way to act that

Trust me, I’m a fighter and a lover
But the only time I fight is to reveal my true colours

Con sandunga 
Oye boricua 
No te me duermas 

Que si te duermes te tumban 
Youh, el Voltaje 
Que es lo que hay marunga 

Si tu quiere mambo, manga mi ritmo 
Rumba caliente, Acabando 
Si tu quiere mambo agárrate una mami 
Pa' que siga guayetiando y raspando 

Digo, Si tu quiere mambo 
Evítense problema 
Socio sigue pinchando 
Que paja loco 

Si tu quiere mambo 
Gozate la vida como yo 
Vacilando 

Tu dale mambo que las nena están de pinga 
Y ten cuidau que si te duermes te chingan 
El que no tiene dinga, tiene mandinga 
Y el que mucho jeringa se le puede ir la chiringa 

Ando revoltoso como el cabro de minga 
Bebiendo Bacardi, con agua e piringa 
Guayando la evilla, fumando marimba 
Gozandome la vida y tocando la timba 

Pa las de cuerpo lindo, y de caralinda 
La que de lo que me cuelga, se me arreguinda 
Loco metele sandunga pa que nadie se rinda 
Y como dicen por ahí panas son las que me guidan, din dan 

Si tu quiere mambo, aquí tiene mambo,tu coje mambo 
Y pa las mamis en Miami y ami socios en Orlando 
Latinos en New York 
No se me duerman en el trambo 

Sabor, control y rumba 
Mueve marunga, con mi sandunga 
Pa que meneen lo que tienen las culonas y las chumbas 
Por que cuando Voltio sumba comokiera se las tumba 

Si tu quiere mambo, suelten la envidia 
Y dejen de estar tirando 
Si tu quieres mambo 
Gosense la vida como yo vacilando 

Contando cheles, metió de hotel en hoteles 
En vez de rifles y pistolas, panty y brasieles 
Envuelto como yunta e pasteles, me tiene las mujeres 
Pero yo ando listo pa que no me pelen 

Que pajó ma, pa ti lo que hay son claveles 
Pero no me celes, ni veles 
Yo tengo al dia mis papeles, no dejo que te me cueles 
Ni que te me reveles 

Aqui el que no se la come se la huele 
Yo hago un par de cositas que no salen en la tele 
No soy rico ni famoso como el gran Rockefeller 
Pero tengo lo que a unos le gusta y lo que a otros les duele 
Mambo 

Si tu quiere mambo, aquí tiene mambo,tu coge mambo 
El otro bando, esta capotiando 
Dejen la envidia y dejen de estar tirando 

Lleno de alegría positiva mi energía 
Como el jigiri diria, me siento al dia en la mía 
Ya tengo la masa encendía 
La que se meta en mi via, tan tan chulería 
Ya tu sabes 

Si tu quiere mambo, nena coge mambo, aquí tiene mambo 
Es Julio Voltio, estoy vacilando y con mi disco yo salgo sabotiando 

La calle esta mala 
Pal que se la busca, me tira, me jode y me jala 
Así que embala, que lo puede mangar las balas 

La calle está buena 
Así que cojela con suavena 
Gozar beber y fumar pero curandote la vena 
Con las nenas, las latinas chikitita bonita y morena 

No sufra may condona 
Y olvidese de las penas 
Esto es pa los que tiran 
Y el alma te envenena 

Youh, Bajen la antena
Y olvidese de la vida ajena 

Dale mambo, Loko dale mambo 
Elias dale mambo, White lion dale mambo 
Danny, el mambo, Mami coje el mambo 
Sigan bailotiando, Sigan guayeteando

No es un trambo, chuleria

Or should I say she once had me 
She showed me her room 
Isn't it good Norwegian wood? 

She asked me to stay 
And she told me to sit anywhere 
So I looked around 
And I noticed there wasn't a chair 

I sat on a rug biding my time 
Drinking her wine 
We talked until two and then she said 
""It's time for bed"" 

She told me she worked 
In the morning and started to laugh 
I told her I didn't 
And crawled off to sleep in the bath

Hey Matthew, what do you see?

See their faces, do you know their names? 
Hey Matthew, when you're watching TV;
Hey, Hey Matthew, what do you see? 

Do you see the tension in a rich man's house? 
Do you see the cat? Do you see the mouse? 
Do you see the beauty or the big bad beast? 
Do you see the famine? Do you see the feast? 
In this world of villains do you see the crime? 
Is a superhero waiting at the edge of time?

I said Hey, Hey Matthew, what do you see? 

I see Dallas, Dynasty, Terrahawks,

what'll you be? 
Will you walk like a lion in the danger zone? 
Will you pass unnoticed in the great unknown? 
When you see the press out on a witch hunt.
When you see a political publicity stunt.
Will you fight for the right? Will you be a man? 
Will you step aside? Will you give a damn? 

Will you ride that tide with the starry eyed? 
Will you give and take? 
Will you laugh 'til you ache? 
Will you learn to live? 
Will you take? Will you give? 
As the bridges burn, will you live and learn? Will you be numbered with the brave and true? Well, good luck kid, here's lookin' at you.

Hey Matthew, what'll you be? 
Hey Hey Matthew, what'll you be?

I want to be a medic man, a cowboy, 
a train driver, high jump champion, 
a fireman, a pilot, I want to be your friend.

Ist morgens noch ganz unberechenbar.

Als alle andren Mädchen auf der Welt
Hab ich mich notgedrungen
Mittlerweile auf den Zufall eingestellt.

Ich hab mit dir gehofft, gekämpft und gelacht und geweint
Du warst mein Kind, mein Geliebter und mein Freund

dass zwischen dir und mir nichts mehr da ist

Bevor du davon erfahren hast kam dir das Leben langweilig vor
Ja so langweilig vor
die ganze Lust am Leben hast 
Du leider durch das Kranksein verloren
doch du kannst nichts dafür
nichts dafür wenn der Todesengel kommt 
Und seine Hand dich berührt
und er stand vor der Tür
langsam fiel das Atmen schwer der Strick 
Hatte sich langsam geschnürt
und du hörst auf zu zählen
wie viele Spritzen es schon waren, 
Sag wann hörn sie auf deinen Körper zu quälen?
Diese Wörter tun weh,
die Diagnose die der Arzt gibt, 
Du sitzt da verstört unter Tränen
und nichts scheint mehr fair, dein Gesicht bleibt so leer
ich schreib in das Gedicht deinen Schmerz
denn nur Gott hat dieses Recht,
dir zu geben und zu nehmen 
Aber bete denn die Hoffnung stirbt zuletzt
Refrain

Wenn dieses Schicksal dich trifft dann tuts weh doch ich werds nie verstehen
(Doch es kommt, doch es kommt, doch es kommt, wie es kommt)
Ich fall jetzt auf meine Knie und den Schmerz den beweis ich mit Tränen
(Doch es kommt, doch es kommt, doch es kommt, wie es kommt)
Sag warum betet man nur wenn's einem schlecht geht? Ich lass dich nicht gehen
(Doch es kommt, doch es kommt, doch es kommt, wie es kommt)
Lieber Gott du darfst mir diesen Mensch einfach jetzt noch nicht nehmen
(doch es kommt, doch es kommt, doch es kommt, wie es kommt)

Jetzt wächst der Tod in dir drin. Und er wächst, und er wächst,
warum warn die Ärzte so was von blind? Wie konnt so was beginnen?
Und wie lang du lebst kann nur Gott und kein Notarzt bestimmen
Deine Tränen sagen mehr, viel mehr als Tausend Worte,
Worte die dein Leben grad erschweren. Und wir stehen da am Meer
Du willst fliegen wie ein Vogel doch du bist in einem Käfig eingesperrt
Ich warte hier bei dir
auch wenn du deinen Verstand, den Glauben und die Haare jetzt verlierst
ganz egal wie sehr du frierst, ich deck dich zu und pass auf dass du den Atem inhalierst
Ich halt deine Hand, deine Augen fallen zu, meine Faust guck sie ballt sich zusammen
Ballt sich zusammen, und es kommt wie es kommt, kein Entkommen
Du wirst alt du wirst krank
Refrain

Wenn dieses Schicksal dich trifft dann tuts weh doch ich werds nie verstehen

Lieber Gott du darfst mir diesen Mensch einfach jetzt noch nicht nehmen
(Doch es kommt, doch es kommt, doch es kommt, wie es kommt)

Du warst ein so guter Mensch
Zu jedem nett, hast gelacht, warum konnte Gott nicht so was erkennen?
Sag was hast du nur getan?
Was hast du schlimmes nur getan dass du grad mit deinem Leben hier bezahlst?
Und ich halt deine Hand. Zum dritten mal, vierten mal, fünften mal, sie wird kalt
schau mich an, schau mich an wenn du mich hörst,
verdammt gib mir jetzt ein Zeichen, bitte du musst bleiben
Unterdrücken fällt mir schwer, ich kann die Tränen nicht mehr halten
Komm zurück ich kann nicht mehr, komm zurück ich schwör ich sterb
Ich bin pausenlos gefickt, bitte lauf nicht in das Licht

Die Hüte tief I'm Gesicht
Alle straßen endlos
Barrikaden gab's für uns doch nicht.
Do und ich
Das war einfach unschlagbar
Ein Paar wie Blitz und Donner
Und immer nur auf brennend heißer Spur.
Wir war'n so richtig Freunde für die Ewigkeit
Das war doch klar
Haben die Wolken nicht gesehen am Horizont
Bis es dunkel war
Und dann war's passiert
Hab es nicht kapiert
Ging alles viel zu schnell
Doch zwei wie wir
Die dürfen sich nie verlier'n!
Hinterm Horizont geht's weiter
Ein neuer Tag
Hinterm Horizont immer weiter
Zusammen sind wir stark!
Das mit uns ging so tief rein
Das kann nie zu Ende sein
Sowas Großes geht nicht einfach so vorbei!

Das war einfach unschlagbar
Ein Paar wie Blitz und Donner
Zwei wie wir
Die können sich nie verlier'n.
Hinterm Horizont geht's weiter
Ein neuer Tag
Hinterm Horizont immer weiter
Zusammen sind wir stark!
Das mit uns ging so tief rein
Das kann nie zu Ende sein
Denn zwei wie wir
Die können sich nie verlier'n.
Hinterm Horizont geht's weiter!

Karel Gott,"Wenn ich auf Wolken schweb', schwebst du wie ich
Wenn man mich nicht versteht, glaubst du an mich
Wenn ich den Mut verlier', machst du mich stark
Dein Schweigen liest in mir, was ich nicht sag'

Sind andere kalt zu mir, wärmt mich dein Blick
Und wenn ich Freude spür', teilst du mein Glück

Du gibst selbst meinem Schmerz noch einen Sinn
Du siehst mir bis ins Herz so wie ich bin

Du zeigst mir
Alles ist so einfach, einfach weil du hier bist
Mit dir führt jeder Anfang an ein Ziel
Auf einmal
Scheint mir alles möglich, nur weil du bei mir bist
Ich weiß wofür ich lebe
Denn ich fühl', ich bin da um dich zu lieben

Wenn in mir Fragen sind, sprichst du sie aus
Sobald ich zu dir find', bin ich zu Haus'
Will ich alleine sein, lässt du es zu
Kann ich mir nicht verzeih'n, so kannst es du

Du zeigst mir

Mit dir führt jeder Anfang an ein Ziel
Auf einmal
Scheint mir alles möglich, nur weil du bei mir bist 
Ich weiß wofür ich lebe

Manchmal war ich oben, manchmal ging ich unter
Sobald ich dich fand, glaub' ich an Wunder

Hab' Dein Lachen im Ohr, es kommt mir so vor

Ich kann Dich nicht sehen, ich kann nicht verstehen 
Eine Liebe, sie bricht so entzwei 

Ich warte so lang, doch Du rufst mich nicht an

I'm as helpless as a kitten up a tree
And I feel like I'm clinging to a cloud
I can't understand
I get misty, holding your hand

Walk my way
And a thousand violins begin to play
Or it might be the sound of your hello
That music I hear
I get misty the moment you're near

You can say that you're leading me on
But it's just what I want you to do
Don't you realize how hopelessly I'm lost
That's why I'm following you

On my own
Would I wander through this wonderland alone
Never knowing my right foot from my left
My hat from my glove
I get misty, and too much in love

Karel Gott,"Für immer jung, ein Leben lang für immer jung
Du musst dich an die schöne Zeit erinnern
Denn nichts ist für immer
Für immer jung, ein Leben lang für immer jung
Du musst dich an die schöne Zeit erinnern
Denn nichts ist für immer

Du scheißt auf die, die sinnlos reden
Denn du bleibst ein Mann der Tat
Arbeitest grad hart
Den ganzen gottverdammten Tag
Du fühlst dich alt und schwach, du fühlst dich ausgelaugt
Und das Schwein von Chef lässt an dir die schlechte Laune raus
Was für ein Pausenclown, 10 Jahre Blut und Schweiß
Du guckst in den Spiegel, dieser Blick sagt „Genug, es reicht!“
Bei deiner Frau ist Funkstille, Trauer, geht sie fremd?
Hast du echt noch Kraft dem Hund aufzulauern?
Die Kinder ha’m dich auch belogen
Egal ob Rauchen, Party, Saufen, Drogen
So hast du dein Blut nicht aufgezogen
Jeder denkt an sich, doch wer denkt an dich?
Früher College-Jacken, jetzt der Anzug, du erkennst dich nicht!
Dieses Leben ist halt einfach kalt und schwer
Und jedes Jahr kommen jetzt ein paar Falten mehr
Sag wie gern würdest du jetzt frei wie ein Adler fliegen
Kein’ Gedanken mehr verschwenden, irgendwann im Sarg zu liegen

Für immer jung, ein Leben lang für immer jung
Du musst dich an die schöne Zeit erinnern
Denn nichts ist für immer
Für immer jung, ein Leben lang für immer jung
Du musst dich an die schöne Zeit erinnern
Denn nichts ist für immer

Deine Eltern sind jetzt alt und krank
Und das ist wie ein schlechter Film
Und du betest jetzt zu Gott bitte halt ihn an
Es kommt dir vor wie gestern, du warst grade neun
Dein erstes Tor, man ist stolz wenn sich der Vater freut
Er war dein Trainer, ihr kickt vor dem Haus
Heute läuft der Mann gebeugt mit 'nem Krückstock ins Haus
Du wirst traurig, dieser Mann der täglich mit dir draußen war
Sitzt ganz allein am Küchentisch und hat jetzt Grauen Star
Er ist krank, krank weil ihm die Niere fehlt
Der Stock begleitet ihn wenn er heut' spazierengeht
Ihr geht es schlechter als ihm,
Aber keinen interessiert's der Arzt gibt ihr meist den letzten Termin
Wer kann die Zeit jedoch zurückdrehen
Wer gibt dir wieder diese Kraft, sie ist schwach
Guck mal sie kann nur gebückt gehen
Und dir bleibt nur deine Erinnerung
Alles ist vergänglich, doch wir wären gern für immer jung
Immer jung

Für immer jung, ein Leben lang für immer jung
Du musst dich an die schöne Zeit erinnern
Denn nichts ist für immer

Für immer jung, ein Leben lang für immer jung
Du musst dich an die schöne Zeit erinnern
Denn nichts ist für immer

Wie gern würde ich jetzt sagen „Hoffnung stirbt zuletzt“
Was hab ich getan? Warum bestraft mich Gott mit diesem Pech?
Wann wird mir bewusst, dass nichts hier für immer ist?
Das alles irgendwann zerbricht und ich dann in den Trümmern sitz’
Genieß den Augenblick, wenn du mit deinen Freunden bist
Diesen Moment mit deiner Mutter, denn dann freut sie sich
Irgendwann wird sie geh’n, genieß den Augenblick
Den du grade mit ihr teilst, alles andere braucht sie nicht
Und diese scheiß Gewohnheit, jeder denkt an sich
Kinder stressen ihren Vater, bis er lediglich zerbricht
Bis er einfach nicht mehr kann
Und auch nicht mehr reden will
Weil er wieder jung sein möchte und auch leben will
Nichts ist für immer, wir wären gern für immer jung
Lass uns die Zeit, die bleibt, einfach nur verbringen und
Vergiss auch ein’ Tag den harten Job
Hol’ jetzt die Ray Ban, die Blue Jeans, sing für sie, Karel Gott!

Für immer jung, ein Leben lang für immer jung
Du musst dich an die schöne Zeit erinnern
Denn nichts ist für immer
Für immer jung, ein Leben lang für immer jung
Ich werde einfach immer alles geben
Ein Leben lang für immer jung
Ich werde einfach immer alles geben
Für immer im Leben
Für immer, für immer, für immer jung",Für Immer Jung,2008

Karel Gott,"Du wurdest mit der Krankheit geboren
Bevor du davon erfahren hast kam dir das Leben langweilig vor
Ja so langweilig vor
die ganze Lust am Leben hast 
Du leider durch das Kranksein verloren
doch du kannst nichts dafür
nichts dafür wenn der Todesengel kommt 
Und seine Hand dich berührt
und er stand vor der Tür
langsam fiel das Atmen schwer der Strick 
Hatte sich langsam geschnürt
und du hörst auf zu zählen
wie viele Spritzen es schon waren, 
Sag wann hörn sie auf deinen Körper zu quälen?
Diese Wörter tun weh,
die Diagnose die der Arzt gibt, 
Du sitzt da verstört unter Tränen
und nichts scheint mehr fair, dein Gesicht bleibt so leer
ich schreib in das Gedicht deinen Schmerz
denn nur Gott hat dieses Recht,
dir zu geben und zu nehmen 
Aber bete denn die Hoffnung stirbt zuletzt
Refrain

Wenn dieses Schicksal dich trifft dann tuts weh doch ich werds nie verstehen
(Doch es kommt, doch es kommt, doch es kommt, wie es kommt)
Ich fall jetzt auf meine Knie und den Schmerz den beweis ich mit Tränen
(Doch es kommt, doch es kommt, doch es kommt, wie es kommt)
Sag warum betet man nur wenn's einem schlecht geht? Ich lass dich nicht gehen
(Doch es kommt, doch es kommt, doch es kommt, wie es kommt)
Lieber Gott du darfst mir diesen Mensch einfach jetzt noch nicht nehmen
(doch es kommt, doch es kommt, doch es kommt, wie es kommt)

Jetzt wächst der Tod in dir drin. Und er wächst, und er wächst,
warum warn die Ärzte so was von blind? Wie konnt so was beginnen?
Und wie lang du lebst kann nur Gott und kein Notarzt bestimmen
Deine Tränen sagen mehr, viel mehr als Tausend Worte,
Worte die dein Leben grad erschweren. Und wir stehen da am Meer
Du willst fliegen wie ein Vogel doch du bist in einem Käfig eingesperrt
Ich warte hier bei dir
auch wenn du deinen Verstand, den Glauben und die Haare jetzt verlierst
ganz egal wie sehr du frierst, ich deck dich zu und pass auf dass du den Atem inhalierst
Ich halt deine Hand, deine Augen fallen zu, meine Faust guck sie ballt sich zusammen
Ballt sich zusammen, und es kommt wie es kommt, kein Entkommen
Du wirst alt du wirst krank
Refrain

Wenn dieses Schicksal dich trifft dann tuts weh doch ich werds nie verstehen
(Doch es kommt, doch es kommt, doch es kommt, wie es kommt)
Ich fall jetzt auf meine Knie und den Schmerz den beweis ich mit Tränen
(Doch es kommt, doch es kommt, doch es kommt, wie es kommt)
Sag warum betet man nur wenn's einem schlecht geht? Ich lass dich nicht gehen
(doch es kommt, doch es kommt, doch es kommt, wie es kommt)
Lieber Gott du darfst mir diesen Mensch einfach jetzt noch nicht nehmen
(Doch es kommt, doch es kommt, doch es kommt, wie es kommt)

Du warst ein so guter Mensch
Zu jedem nett, hast gelacht, warum konnte Gott nicht so was erkennen?
Sag was hast du nur getan?
Was hast du schlimmes nur getan dass du grad mit deinem Leben hier bezahlst?
Und ich halt deine Hand. Zum dritten mal, vierten mal, fünften mal, sie wird kalt
schau mich an, schau mich an wenn du mich hörst,
verdammt gib mir jetzt ein Zeichen, bitte du musst bleiben
Unterdrücken fällt mir schwer, ich kann die Tränen nicht mehr halten
Komm zurück ich kann nicht mehr, komm zurück ich schwör ich sterb
Ich bin pausenlos gefickt, bitte lauf nicht in das Licht

I was kissed by my sisters, my cousins, and my aunties.
Sad to tell, it was hell, an inferno worse than Dante's.

So my dear I swore,
""Never, never more!""
On my list, I insisted that kissing must be crossed out.
Now, I find I was blind, and oh my! 
How I lost out!

I could cry salty tears,
Where have I been all these years?
Little wow, tell me now,
How long has this been going on?

There were chills up my spine,
And some thrills I can't define.
Listen, sweet, I repeat,
How long has this been going on?

Oh, I feel that I could melt,
Into Heaven I'm hurled!
I know how Columbus felt,
Finding another world.

Kiss me once, then once more.
What a dunce I was before.
What a break! 
For Heaven's sake!
How long has this been going on?

Dear, when in your arms I creep,
That divine rendezvous,
Don't wake me, if I'm asleep,
Let me dream that it's true!

Kiss me twice, then once more.
That makes thrice, let's make it four!
What a break!

Karen Briggs,"Always alone, someone come for me
Here on my own feels like the pain lasts an eternity
Tears come no more, I wanna smile again, love again
Please someone find me

Souls pass me by why can’t they see me here?
Touch me one time, just like magic I will reappear
Sadness like the rain it showers over me
I wanna feel again, please someone find me

Lost not yet found, grieving in misery
Hope lurks around, when will the sun ever shine on me?
I need love to come and carry me
Take me away, please someone find me

Are you seeing my soul? Maybe I'll scream and shout
Please someone call, I don't wanna live without love
Hear my plea, I have love to give
I wanna live, please someone find me

Karen Brooks,"You turn down the covers
I'll turn down the lights
As we turn to each other
There's no turning back tonight

I lay on I love you
And you lay on your charms
As we lie here
In each other's arms

Faking love, faking love
Only temporary lovers
As we lie here to each other
We're just faking love

You put on the coffee
I'll put on a smile
We'll put each other on
And laugh and talk a little while

There's no use in crying
For a feeling that's all gone
We both knew we were lying
All along

Faking love, faking love
Only temporary lovers
As we lie here to each other
We're just faking love

Faking love, faking love
Only temporary lovers
As we lie here to each other
We're just faking love

We're just faking love

Ooh
Ooh, ooh so good

You've been my mother, my father
My sister, my brother
My friend until the end
My doctor and my lawyer

My emotion, my devotion
Dedication, motivation
My strength, my power
My mind, you're so kind

Provider, co-signer
My breakthrough, my faith too
My up, my down
My shield, my crown

This Holy Ghost I have the world
Can't take it
Can't take it
Can't take it

verse 1
(becoming a lady)[yeah]
There are so many things to learn[uh huh]
About life and things that we're made of[now I see where this is all going]
Don't wanna be mistaken
For not being a christian girl[uh huh]
And my fear is being made fun of)
[baby let me tell you how to cope](tell me)
'cause ya mama went through the same thing(i bet you did)
Be not justified by what your friends might think]

chorus
(mama I do my best
To obey the rules that you and daddy set
To keep me from doin' somethin' that I might regret
Even though it's hard mama don't change)
[being a mama ain't a easy task
It's more than examples on how to cook and dress
Discipline and values I know you need to get
Even though your hard headed don't change]

verse2
(i know that I am special)[yes you are]
Because I am a child [mama's baby]of the king
But in the school they be thinking that I am arrogant[what now hold]
I don't understand it[well]
You told me to be proud of myself[yes I did]
Why does it seem like I'm doing all the wrong things)
[ let me tell you how to be
When your attacked by the hands of the enemy
Hold you head up high
And in him you must believe]

chrous

But I hear you and daddy too
Thank you for showing me what to do)

([we can make it together])

j-moss

From harmful things, ooooo

Dance, take advantage of this chance

With all that you're going through everyday
From being tempted to resented and you need direction
Sometimes heaven seems so far away
With all of the money spent that you make
But the righteous won't be forsaken
You just keep on pressin'

VERSE: I might get personal so protect your toes
Cause I feel I need to let my heel down
For we do all that we can to
Treat our NEIGHBOR right but
Sometimes we wanna scream
We try to turn the other cheek
And stay on our knees and keep our tempers under control, but you know
Every now and then you wanna tell somebody what they mean

VERSE: Working that Job so hard from dusk to dawn
To keep a decent roof overhead
But your debt is evergrowing
Even working over time
And sometimes you wanna scream
But God knows the pain is there and how much we can
Bear we didn't come this far to be left alone
That's why we gotta be strong for the prayers of the righteous will availeth many things

HOOK: For the trials that we see are here to make us stronger
Grab onto his hand and live in fear no longer
Like a tree planted by the rivers of water
We shall not be moved
Stand firm in your service
Your eyes will be dried in the morning

Too many storms have passed your way
And you're all washed out cause it rained on your parade
Seems nobody cares about you anyway
Now you're living your life like a castaway
Searched for strength inside was it all in vain
Cause the deeper you dig you find more and more pain
Don't let your tomorrow be like yesterday
Cause I spoke to God, I called out your name
And on your behalf, I just asked if He would be there for you
I want you to

Be Blessed, Don't live life in distress
Just let go, let God, He'll work it out for you
I pray that your soul will be blessed
Forever in his rest, Cause you deserve his best no less

Enter a place where you never have to cry
Never have to live a lie, never have to wonder why
Never want for nothing you're always satisfied
In the peace that his arms will provide
He will erase any guilt or shame, any bad habits you've got

You won't wanna do em again, Yes we all can change, I can testify
See I spoke to God, I called out your name
And on your behalf, I just asked, If he would be there for you

Like the damp grass that yields to me
I have never known hunger
Like these insects that feast on me

A thousand teeth
And yours among them, I know
Our hungers appeased
Our heartbeats becoming slow

We lay here for years or for hours
Thrown here or found
To freeze or to thaw
So long we become the flowers

Two corpses I saw

And they'd find us in a week
When the weather gets hot
After the insects have made their claim
I'd be home with you
I'd be home with you

I have never known sleep
Like the slumber that creeps to me
I have never known color
Like this morning reveals to me

And you haven't moved an inch
Such that I would not know
If you sleep always like this
The flesh calmly going cold

We lay here for years or for hours
Your hand in my hand
So still and discreet
So long we become the flowers
We'd feed well the land
And worry the sheep

And they'd find us in a week
When the cattle show fear
After the insects have made their claim
After the foxes have known our taste
I'd be home with you
I'd be home with you

They'd find us in a week (Lay here for years or for hours)
When the weather gets hot (So long we become the flowers)
They'd find us in a week (Lay here for years or for hours)
When the cattle shows fear (So long we become the flowers)

After the foxes have known our taste
After the raven has had its say

[Spoken] 
Wanted a nanny for two adorable children 

[Sung] 
If you want this choice position 
Have a cheery disposition 
Rosy cheeks, no warts! 
Play games, all sort 

You must be kind, you must be witty 
Very sweet and fairly pretty 
Take us on outings, give us treats 
Sing songs, bring sweets 

Never be cross or cruel 
Never give us castor oil or gruel 
Love us as a son and daughter 
And never smell of barley water 

If you won't scold and dominate us 
We will never give you cause to hate us 
We won't hide your spectacles 
So you can't see 
Put toads in your bed 
Or pepper in your tea 
Hurry, Nanny! 
Many thanks 
Sincerely,

Check it out, uh
If in this life 
I strive to please Him
In this day and night 
I'm not always right
Even when I'm wrong 
You should be afraid to anger Him
'Cause you could be gone
Him don't need us 
It's the other way round
Do you know what I'm talking about
When I say Him, clown?
You can't look at nobody 
And say that's Him
'Cause He's invisible 
Yet visible, this is critical 
Relying on our own abilities you lose
You need him 
To help make your bumpy ride a cruise
Ask Magic about him 
Or any strong believer
He's the quarterback 
We the receivers
Catching blessings 
Better than touchdowns
I seek him when 
Niggas want to buck me down
Him holds many holy titles
Him has many names 
Him has many bibles
The devil can't deal with Him, uh
He tempted me but you see 
I'm still with Him
Listen close
All brothers are men
Him is responsible for all colors and kin
I bust with Him
If only I can fully trust in Him
I'm glad to be stuck with Him
Rather have Him than money
I'm serious
He'll get you once you become curious
Lord, give me happy, long life
Real good sex with the wife
No traveling with bodyguards
It's just a real nigga godly entourage

My relationship with the God 
Is kind of odd
The nigga the B-I-G won't part
Feeling the presence up in my heart
But never no chicken to the nigga
In on that style like that
Talking about the way the Lord
Be lifting these burdens up off my back
Better that I bust raps
The way that I cut that
Ho you couldn't
You trying too hard, you better find Him
I'm hoping you understood it
Could it be (What?)
The niggas around the way
Don't really be thinking about the consequences
Under the circumstances 
Until you pinch them
Then a nigga be one to listen (Why?)
Cause you woke that ass up
Yoke that ass up
Proving the man in the sky
That holds that ass up
But it's over now
He cut off
Some niggas done broke you clean off
But got to get on your knees 
And praise the only

The moon glows
The wind blows
The rain falls

You want me to know that you're mine, mine

The angels sing the sweetest song I ever heard
You speak, and the angels sing
Or am I breathing music into every word

Suddenly, the setting is strange
I can see water and moonlight beaming
Silver waves that break on some undiscovered shore - Then
Suddenly, I see it all change
Long winter nights with the candles gleaming
Through it all your face that I adore.

You smile, and the angels sing
And though it's just a gentle murmur at the start
We kiss, and the angels sing
And leave their music ringing in my heart.",And the Angels Sing,2003
Karen Francis,"A country dance was being held in a garden
I felt a bump and heard an ""Oh, beg your pardon""
Suddenly I saw polka dots and moonbeams
All around a pug-nosed dream

The music started and was I the perplexed one
I held my breath and said ""May I have the next one?""
In my frightened arms, polka dots and moonbeams
Sparkled on a pug-nosed dream

There were questions in the eyes of other dancers
As we floated over the floor
There were questions but my heart knew all the answers
And perhaps a few things more

Now in a cottage built of lilacs and laughter
I know the meaning of the words ""Ever after""
And I'll always see polka dots and moonbeams
When I kiss the pug-nosed dream",Polka Dots and Moonbeams,1996

The elevator rose to the eleventh floor
(I've seen better days)
Her trench coat hangs inside her door
(I've seen better days)
A leaky window welcomed rain and left me standing here

He held all the stars in the palm of his hand
And they ran through his fingers like grains of sand
And one little star fell alone

Then the Lord God hunted through the wide night air 
For the little dark star on the wind down there 
And he stated and promised he'd take special care 
So it wouldn't get lost again

Now a man don't mind if the stars grow dim 
And the clouds blow over and darken him
So long as the Lord God's watching over them
Keeping track of how it all goes on

Giving them eargasms with my mellow accent
Still moving this flavour with homies Blackstreet and Teddy

Floating on the silence that surrounds us
Quiet thoughts 'n quiet dreams, quiet walks by quiet streams
Climbing hills where lovers go to watch the world below together

from all the earthly cares around us
My world was dull each minute until I found you in it
And all at once the happiness I knew,
Became these quiet nights of loving you!

I see him every day in the office, he's sexy and he's smooth
He's good to look me over, but slow to make his move

This waiting game is gettin' old, it's time to take matters into my hands

That's how I'd cry in my pillow

How still we see thee lie
Above thy deep and dreamless sleep
The silent stars go by
Yet in thy dark streets shineth
The everlasting Light
The hopes and fears of all the years
Are met in thee tonight

And gathered all above
While mortals sleep, the angels keep
Their watch of wondering love
O morning stars together
Proclaim the holy birth
And praises sing to God the King
And Peace to men on earth

No crib for a bed

Lay down His sweet head
The stars in the sky
Look down where He lay

Cast out our sin and enter in
Be born to us today

O come to us, abide with us

For they both have the very same sensation
When you're locked in the magic of a kiss

Beware my foolish heart

Then let the fire start

Just trying to resist you
I'm trembling now

This world's waited long enough,
I've come home at last!

And brighter than we knew it.

Could I stop my hand from shaking?

Down by yon shady harbour I carelessly did stray
The thrushes they were warbling, the violets they were charming
To view fond lovers talking, a while I did delay

She said, my dear don't leave me all for another season
Though fortune does be pleasing I'll go along with you
I'll forsake friends and relations and bid this Irish Nation
And to the bonny Bann banks forever I'll bid adieu

He said, my dear don't grieve or yet annoy my patience
You know I love you dearly the more I'm going away
I'm going to a foreign nation to purchase a plantation
To comfort us hereafter all in America

We'll be happy as Queen Victoria, all in her greatest glory
We'll be drinking wine and porter, all in America

Karen Matheson,"Last night I dreamed my head was in fever
Last night I dreamed it never was so far
To reach the shore of safety and redemption
And a gaze upon the bright morning star

I dreamed I was by friends all put abandoned
I dreamed I was alone but for my scars
And blinded by the tears that fell like water
No more to see the bright morning star

The streets of dreams never looked this lonely
The streets of dreams never felt this hard
And I heard my voice barely of a whisper
As the clouds denied the bright morning star

Sometimes this life is no more than a moment
And sometimes this light is lost unto the dark
But courage hears the sound of dawn approaching
And each our own, bright morning star

I woke to find every window open
I woke to find the heavy door jar
And I walked outside and stood upon the hilltop
And gazed one small bright morning star

I walked outside and every bird was singing
As I found again my bright morning star
",Bright Morning Star,2014
Karen Matheson,"I can tell by the way you're walking
You don't want company 
I'll let you alone and I'll let you walk on 
And in your own good time you'll be 

Back where the sun can find you
Under the wise wishing tree 
And with all of them made we'll lie under the shade
And call it a jubilee

And I can tell by the way you're talking
That the past isn't letting you go 
But there's only so long you can take it all on
And then the wrong's gotta be on its own

And when you're ready to leave it behind you
You'll look back and all that you'll see 
Is the wreckage and rust that you left in the dust
On your way to the jubilee

And I can tell by the way you're listening
That you're still expecting to hear 
Your name being called like a summons to all
Who have failed to account for their doubts and their fears

They can't add up to to much without you
And so if it were up to me, I'd take hold of your hand 
Saying come hear the band
Play your song at the jubilee 

And I can tell by the way you're searching
For something you can't even name  
That you haven't been able to come to the table
Simply glad that you came

When you feel like this try to imagine
That we're all like frail boats on the sea 
Just scanning the night for that great guiding light
Announcing the jubilee 

And I can tell by the way you're standing
With your eyes filling with tears 
That it's habit alone that keeps you turning for home
Even though your home is right here

Where the people who love you are gathered
Under the wise wishing tree 
May we all be considered then straight on delivered
Down to the jubilee 

Because to people who love you are waiting
And they'll wait just as long as need be 
When we look back and say those were halcyon days 
We're talking about jubilee",Jubilee,2014

For the G.I. Josephs who were in the war
But for generals things were not so grand
And it's not so hard to understand

What can you do with a general
When he stops being a general?
Oh, what can you do with a general who retires?
Who's got a job for a general
When he stops being a general?
They all get a job but a general no one hires

They fill his chest with medals while he's across the foam
And they spread the crimson carpet when he comes marching home
The next day someone hollers when he comes into view
""Here comes the general"" and they all say ""General who?""

They're delighted that he came
But they can't recall his name

When they stop wining and dining him

That I always have found it best,
Instead of getting 'em off my chest,
To let 'em rest unexpressed.

At least it'll tell you how great you are.

You're the smile on the Mona Lisa.

But if, Baby, I'm the bottom,
You're the top!

Your words poetic are not pathetic

You're a baby grand of a lady and a gent.
You're an old dutch master, You're Mrs. Aster,
You're Pepsodent.
You're romance, You're the steppes of Russia,
You're the pants on a Roxy usher.

You're the top! You're the Tower of Babel.
You're the top! You're the Whitney Stable.

You're a dress from Saks's, You're next year's taxes,'
You're stratosphere.
You're my thoist, You're a Drumstick Lipstick,
You're the foist in the Irish svipstick,
I'm a frightened frog that can find no log to hop,

On this, our weddin' day
Do not forsake me, oh my darlin'

I only know I must be brave
And I must face a man who hates me

Or lie a coward in my grave

S'posin' I lose my fair-haired beauty

Vowed it would be my life or his'n

Karen O,"Oh, God said to Abraham, ""Kill me a son""
Abe said, ""Man, you must be puttin' me on""
God said, ""No"" Abe say, ""What?""
God say, ""You can do what you want, Abe, but
The next time you see me comin', you better run""
Well, Abe said, ""Where d'you want this killin' done?""
God said, ""Out on Highway 61""

Well, Georgia Sam, he had a bloody nose
Welfare department, they wouldn't give him no clothes
He asked poor Howard, ""Where can I go?""
Howard said, ""There's only one place I know""
Sam said, ""Tell me quick, man, I got to run""
Oh, Howard just pointed with his gun
And said, ""That way, down Highway 61""

Well, Mack the Finger said to Louie the King
""I got forty red-white-and-blue shoestrings
And a thousand telephones that don't ring
Do you know where I can get rid of these things?""
And Louie the King said, ""Let me think for a minute, son""
Then he said, ""Yes, I think it can be easily done
Just take everything down to Highway 61""

Now, the fifth daughter on the twelfth night
Told the first father that things weren't right
""My complexion,"" she says, ""is much too white""
He said, ""Come here and step into the light""
He said, ""Hmm, you're right, let me tell the second mother this has been done""
But the second mother was with the seventh son
And they were both out on Highway 61

Now, the roving gambler he was very bored
Trying to create a next world war
He found a promoter who nearly fell off the floor
He said, ""I never engaged in this kind of thing before
But yes, I think it can be very easily done
We'll just put some bleachers out in the sun
And have it on Highway 61""",Highway 61 Revisited,2007

And they want more station,
Stormed my winter palace,

Run my reputation,
Try to pull my status,
But they couldn't fake it!

Trying to put a bullet on you guys won't go,
Looking for your ticket, the less will go,
But your guys won't go!
Man, you look on, you look on your race,
But I'm too gone, I' too gone…
When you get on, you get on, you shake it!
Man, took on, took on, too much don't blow!

Can I get a witness, closer look,
Everybody
And you could be the widget to my turbo,
Let me see your status on a closer look,
Do you forget, forget the basics?
On a you must go search,
And it's too far; it's too far the basis,
But you're slipping, you're sliding,
Can make it go!

I didn't know I was looking for love until I found you (3x)
I didn't know I was looking for love (2x)

'cause there I stood and I would
Oh I wonder could I say what I felt
And not be misunderstood

Slap on my map on my heart you landed
I was coy but you made me candid
And now the planets circle around you

I didn't know I was looking for love until I found you baby(3x)
I didn't know I was looking for love (2x)

So we build from here with love the foundation
In a world of tears, one consolation
Now you're here there's a full brass band
Playin' in me like a wonderland
And if you left I would be two foot small
And every tear would be a waterfall
Soundless boundless I surround you

Karen Ramirez,"I was alone thinkin' I was just fine
I wasn't lookin' for anyone to be mine
I thought love was just a fabrication
A train that wouldn't stop at my station

Home, alone, that was my consignment
Solitary confinement
So when we met I was skirting around you

I didn't know I was looking for love until I found you (3x)
I didn't know I was looking for love (2x)

'cause there I stood and I would
Oh I wonder could I say what I felt
And not be misunderstood
A thousand stars came into my system
I never knew how much I had missed them

Slap on my map on my heart you landed
I was coy but you made me candid
And now the planets circle around you

I didn't know I was looking for love until I found you baby(3x)
I didn't know I was looking for love (2x)

So we build from here with love the foundation
In a world of tears, one consolation
Now you're here there's a full brass band
Playin' in me like a wonderland
And if you left I would be two foot small
And every tear would be a waterfall
Soundless boundless I surround you

I didn't know I was looking for love until I found you
I just didn't know

I didn't know I was looking for love until I found you

Gets all the love we girls leave behind.
The reason I know so much about her
Is because she picked up a man of mine.

Was makin' it easy for the clean up woman
To get my man's love, aww, yeah.
Just makin' it easy for the clean up woman
To get my baby's love, huh-huh.

I took this man's love and put it on a shelf,
And, like a fool, I thought I had him all to myself.
When he needed love, I was out havin' fun,
But I found out that all I had done
Was made it easy for the clean up woman
To get my man's love, huh-huh.
Yeah, that's what I did:
I made it easy for the clean up woman
To steal my baby's love, aw, yeah.

The clean up woman will wipe his blues away.
She'll give him plenty lovin', 24 hours a day.
The clean up woman, she'll sweep him off his feet.

I watched my dreams crash to the ground

THERE'S NO PLACE SO LONELY
AS BEIN' HALF OVER YOU",Half Over You,1998
Karen Staley,"I remember the first time I saw you
Your back to me laughin' with your friends
Straw hat and Tony Lamas, whoa, lordy mama
Our story started with the end

I could tell you were the kind to love and leave 'em
Tears would be all I'd have to show
I was hypnotized by those fine Levi's
So I couldn't say I'd hate to see you go
'Cause

Hindsight is 20/20, hindsight is 20/20
Always knew you'd say goodbye one day
But you sure look good walkin' away

I grew to love so many things about you
Your silly sense of humor and your style
Your big, big heart, but one little part
Always made me walk a step behind

You hurt me but I'm finally feelin' better
I'm down to cryin' 'bout you once a week
Those jeans sure fit ya
Sometimes I'd like to hit ya
Just to see you turn the other cheek

But somethin' deep in my heart
Whispered to me there was somethin' more
Now I know you were the missing part

With you, all my fears are gone
It's like I've loved you all along
You're a mirror to my soul

With you, I finally understand
Exactly who I am
I know it's god's forever plan
To be with you

I can be myself and not pretend
Let my true colors show
And still you love me, still you're my best friend
Without a word, without a doubt, I know

Karen Wilhelm,"I just came back from a lovely trip along the Milky Way
Stopped off at the North Pole to spend a holiday
I called on dear old Santa Claus
To see what I could see
He took me to his workshop 
And told his plans to me, so
 
[Chorus]
You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
He's making a list and checking it twice
Gonna find out who's naughty and nice
Santa Claus is comin' to town
He sees you when you're sleepin'
He knows when you're a wake
He knows if you've been bad or good
So be good for goodness sake
Oh! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
 
With little tin horns and little toy drums
Rooty toot toots and rummy tum tums
Santa Claus is comin' to town
And curly head dolls that toddle and coo
Elephants, boats, and kiddie cars too
Santa Claus is comin' to town
Then kids in Girl and Boy land will have a jubilee
They're gonna build a Toyland all around the Christmas tree
So! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
 
Now Santa is a busy man, He has no time to play
He's got millions of stockings to fill on Christmas day
You'd better write your letter now
And mail it right away
Because he's getting ready
His reindeer's and his sleigh. So

Karen Young,"As I was slowly passing 
An orphans' home one day
And stopped for just a moment
To watch the children play
Alone a boy was standing 
And when I asked him why
He turned with eyes that could not see 
And he began to cry

I'm nobody's child
I'm nobody's child
Just like the flowers 
I'm growing wild
No mummy's kisses 
And no daddy's smile
Nobody wants me
I'm nobody's child

People come for children 
And take them for their own
But they all seem to pass me by 
And I am left alone
I know they'd like to take me 
But when they see I'm blind
They always take some other child 
And I am left behind

I'm nobody's child
I'm nobody's child
Just like a flower
I'm growing wild
No mummy's kisses 
And no daddy's smile
Nobody wants me
I'm nobody's child

No mommy's arms to hold me 
Or soothe me when I cry
Sometimes it gets so lonely
I wish that I could die
I'll walk the streets of heaven 
Where all blind can see
And just like all the other kids 
There'd be a home for me

I'm nobody's child
I'm nobody's child
Just like a flower
I'm growing wild
No mummy's kisses 
And no daddy's smile
Nobody wants me
I'm nobody's child

Karen Zoid,"Ek het vriende wat ek sien
Ek is verslaaf aan nikotien
Ek hou van karre wat kan ry
Ek huil gewoonlik as ek baklei

Ek het gedink dat dit sou reën
Toe word ek stil en wag alleen
Tot jy kom klop het
Aan my deur

Ek het n dak bo-oor my kop
En in die winter like ek sop
Ek raak benoud wanneer jy luister
Net soos wanneer mense fluister

Ek wonder of jy sal onthou
Dat jou woorde aan my klou
As jy my insluk
Sonder om te kou

En ek skree ?n song vir jou my my lief
Bly nog n rukkie asseblief
Want as ek sing dan sing jy saam
In ?n droom roep ek jou naam

Ek is so dronk soos Koos Kombuis
Daar is geen swembad by my huis
My sussie bly in Potchefstroom
Die mense daar rook almal boom

Vier seisoene in jou traan
Hou my vas wanneer jy gaan
En ek weer alleen hier staan

So ek skree ?n song vir jou my lief
Jy is n engel en n dief
Want as ons sing
Dan sing ons saam
In n droom roep ek jou naam",Engel,2001
Karen Zumbrunn Jazz Trio,"A country dance was being held in a garden
I felt a bump and heard an ""Oh, beg your pardon""
Suddenly I saw polka dots and moonbeams
All around a pug-nosed dream

The music started and was I the perplexed one
I held my breath and said ""May I have the next one?""
In my frightened arms, polka dots and moonbeams
Sparkled on a pug-nosed dream

There were questions in the eyes of other dancers
As we floated over the floor
There were questions but my heart knew all the answers
And perhaps a few things more

Now in a cottage built of lilacs and laughter
I know the meaning of the words ""Ever after""
And I'll always see polka dots and moonbeams
When I kiss the pug-nosed dream",Polka Dots and Moonbeams,2004

There is someone I'm longing to see
Someone I simply can't help but adore
Someone who'll thrill me forever
Some day my prince will come
Some day I'll find my love

He'll whisper, I love you,
And steal a kiss or two
Though he's far away,
I'll find my love some day
Some day when my dreams come true
Some day I'll find my love
Someone to call my own
And I'll know her the moment we meet

We're swept apart too soon.

Love is a spark lost in the dark,
Too soon, too soon,
I feel wherever I go
That tomorrow is near, tomorrow is here
And always too soon.

Love is pure gold and time a thief.

Somehow he still makes these melodies with my felonies
I ain't buyin' nothin' they sellin' me what you tellin' me
Broken pieces actin' like we ain't cracked
Man we all messed up and cain't no one escape that
We some broken people
Came from broken homes
Broken hearts inside of a broken soul
Alcoholics, the addicts
English, African, Arabs
Ain't no riches to fix it
You still broke when you have it
If you ain't breakin' bad and you still chasin' the habit
It ain't no wonderland so we still chasing the rabbit

Can't nobody buy tickets
You better have will call
That reaper he will call

Work just like me
Lust of the flesh the pride of life they flirt with like me
Regardless of our money we all broke together
And if we don't swallow our pride we gon choke together
Tryna hold onto our lives with these clumsy hands
Fell off the wall of purity
Doing that Humpty dance
Forget the king's horses
Forget the king's men

Been fighting since my daddy left
Fighting for approval
Think I don't know tryna get this world to love me is futile

Than what we were made to be like being what they suggest
We are outsiders, outliers
Out cry is loud, the meek inherit the earth
And God opposes the proud

The morning sun was dead
The Savior of the world was fallen
His body on the cross
His blood poured out for us
The weight of every curse upon Him

One final breath He gave
As Heaven looked away
The Son of God was laid in darkness
A battle in the grave
The war on death was waged
The power of hell forever broken

The ground began to shake
The stone was rolled away
His perfect love could not be overcome

He is alive

The lamb has overcome

If there are words for Him, then I don't have them.
You see my brain has not yet reached the point.
Where it could form a thought that could adequately
describe the greatness of my God
And my lungs have not yet developed the ability to,
release a breathe with enough to agility to
breathe out the greatness of His love
And my voice, you see my voice is so inhibited
Restrained by human limits,
that's hard to even send the praise up
You see if there are words for Him,
I don't have them
My God, His grace is remarkable
Mercies are innumerable
Strength is impenetrable
He is honorable, accountable
Favorable, He's unsearchable yet knowable
Indefinable yet approachable
Indescribable yet personal
He is beyond comprehension
Further than imagination
Constant through generations
King of every nation
But if there are words for Him,
Then I don't have them.
You see my words are few
In trying to capture the one true God
Using my vocabulary would never do
But I use words as an expression,
An expression of worship to a Savior
A Savior who is both worthy and deserving of my praise
So I use words
My heart extols the Lord. Blesses His name forever.
He has won my heart, Captured my mind
And has bond them both together
He is defeated me in my rebellion
Conquered me in my sin
He has welcomed me into His presence
Completely invited me in
He has made Himself the object of my sight
Flooding me with mercies in the morning
Drowning me with grace in the night
But if there are words for Him,
Then I don't have them.
But what I do have is, good news
For my God knew that manmade words
Would never do, the words are just tools
That we use to point to the truth
So He sent His son Jesus Christ
As The Word, living proof
He is the image of the invisible God
The first born of all creation
For by Him all things were created
Giving nothingness formation
And by His words He sustains
In the power of His name
For He is before all things
And over all things He reigns
Holy is His name
So praise Him for His life
The way he preserved in strife
The humble son of God becoming the perfect sacrifice
Praise Him for His death (pause)
That He willingly stood in our place
That He lovingly endured the grave
That He battled our enemy
And on the third day rose in Victory
He is everything that was promised
Praised as the risen King
Lift your voice and sing
For one day He will return for us
And we will finally be united with our Savior
For eternity, eternity
So it's not just words that I proclaim
For my words point to The Word
And The Word has a name
Hope has a name
Joy has a name
Peace has a name
Love has a name
And that name is Jesus Christ
Praise His name forever",Forever (We Sing Hallelujah),2018

On roule sur Genève Saint Gilles et Monaco
On va te faire quer-cro si t'es mon amigo
que des bêtes de chicas même si t'as pas de chicos
Nos rêves sont réels que des passes-dé
Exploit individuel, la classe dans l'aspect
et la gestuelle On nous a dit ?
Sur tous les terrains de foot et de bicrave
Plus de flow dans la bouche que de kilos dans dix caves
T'as beau en avoir qu'un, pourquoi sélectionner dix caves
On est pas des loosers tah Domenech
Diminue tes sourcils pauvre mec
Que les fachos restent en loups
Leurs fils sont mous, que ferait la France sans nous?

Faut mériter sa place dans le carré d'as
Si tu veux soulever la coupe, fais moi la passe
Personne nous remplace dans le carré d'as
Renard dans toutes les surfaces, fais moi la passe

N°9, que du 11 dans le canon
Ici les 10 se font arracher leurs galons
En un touché de balle, le bras long
Esprit en cavale, les frères font tourner le ballon
Fais moi la passe sur la conso, les pâtisseries
Tellement on dandine on peut ouvrir une épicerie
Les matons nous guettent c'est nos paparazzis
Parloir parisi c'est par ici
Parloir fantôme écrit au ghost busters
J'envoie une frappe plus bonne que celle du Hustler
On se leurre, le temps passe avance l'heure
De quoi aller les refaire sur quelques passes, renvoie l'ascenseur
Sur une tallonade, cherche pas ta soeur, elle est dans ma tornade
Essaie pas de nous tacler devant nos supportrices.
Leurs boules est dans notre camp, on les sponsorise

Faut mériter sa place dans le carré d'as

Dans le carré VIP, y a l'équipe des mauvais garçons
Les parasites, on évite,invite que les avions

Roule pas trop vite la lambo a fini aux informations

Les coups s’échangent et tu passes du calme au danger
Échoué, le plan a échoué
Tu peux passer du blanc au noir, du bien au mal

1, la soirée se passe ils jouent leur avenir à 2
En 2 minutes hop, ça devient la guerre de Troie
Ils étaient 4 ou 5 sous l’emprise du 666
Et de la weed oui, surtout d'la 8-6
Cette fois-ci stop, ce jeune homme voulait du neuf
S’marier avec sa meuf, bref avoir 10 enfants
Il en a marre des coups, avec ses zinc’ c’est simple
Mais une chose qui est sûre, c’est pas passé 5 sur 5
Un dîner au chandelles, et tout se passe à merveille
Il négocie la main d'la fille en espérant que sa mère veuille
C’est la soirée d'sa vie, depuis hier Samir veille
Il se dit qu’il veut de l’argent propre, qu’il en a marre d’salir l’oseille
Il esquive même son cousin qui lui demande de faire des coups
Des groupes de mecs le cherchent : ils voient sa tête, ils la découpent
Du coup, Samir s’est rangé tout ça grâce à sa petite amie
Il passe une soirée parfaite en songeant à sa petite famille
D’un coup des mecs à l’entrée rentrent, giflent le videur
Déboulent dans le resto à 5 avec Samir dans l’viseur
Courent vers lui à toute vitesse, coups d’bouteilles au futur gendre
Ils mettent des coups d'pression aux gens, des coups de couteaux aux jambes
Des couples goûtent aux insultes y a que le serveur que ça enchante
Ils mettent la go en sang, en plus elle est enceinte
Ils bousillent les tables les chaises et enchaînent le vacarme
Ils débranchent les câbles, vident les caisses et dépouillent le placard
Ils profitent des femmes et d'leurs fesses
Traitent leurs mecs de bâtards (sale bâtard va)
Et ils mettent en flammes toute la pièce c'est devenu un bazar
Changement d’ambiance que d’la peur, personne pour l'dire aux keufs
Belek ici en 10 minutes tu peux passer du rire aux pleurs

Ok 5, re-noi dans une caisse immatriculée Neuf-Quatre
Sur un fond sonore du Prototype 3
Fonçaient vers la capitale quand l’un d'eux
Sortit l’flash de rhum pour se mettre bi-en
Il est minuit 6 quand ça part en cette-su
La caisse fait des loopings, ça devient le grand 8
Dire qu’ils s’étaient mis yes, p'tites vestes, jeans neufs
C’est l’histoire d’un cauchemar hiver 2010
- Allô?
- C’est ""un tel"", bien ou quoi mon gars sûr? J’ai la caisse, ce soir on sort?
- Si si bien vu t’assures!
- Préviens les autres on s’capte au café qui fait l’angle
Ce soir on s’fait pas recal' : j’ai 4 tickets d’entrée
- Ok!
3h plus tard, tu connais les blacks
Mais bon y a le plein pour fuir si un keuf reconnaît la plaque
Du Sexion à fond, direction la capitale
Ça va clasher du tiek’son jusqu’à Pigalle
Flash de rhum pour s’mettre en condition
Mauvaise idée, car maintenant ""un tel"" conduit saoûl
Il serre un peu trop près le taxi devant
Un radar, le taxi pile et c’est l’accident
Le passager devant s’cogne contre le tableau d’bord
Sa boîte crânienne se fracture, un morceau d’cerveau sort
La carrosserie s’écrase comme une canette
C’est maintenant qu’il pense à Dieu et l'appelle à l'aide
Mais c’est trop tard :
Les vitres explosent les bouts de verre s’enfoncent dans les corps
La caisse part en tonneau et fonce dans l’décor
""Un tel"" sort, et voit les gens en ang-s
Voilà ce qu’on appelle un changement d’ambiance

Debout comme à l’armée à s’esquinter les vertèbres
Faya sous cool-al mais ce coup-ci c’était whisky
Sans cesse à débattre sur le dernier X6
Ce soir c’était nuit blanche des clopes j’en avais plus que 5
4€ d’nnaie-mo pour aller graille' s’mettre ien-b
3 képis qui rodaient en camtar' en moins d’2
Les mains contre le mur au bord des nerfs mais je m’abstiens
Y avait d’la se-ti du pilon c’qu’il faut pour sm’ettre ien-b
La ptite équipe d’élite 2-3 tits-pe qui s’trouvaient dans l’coin
Tout s'passait pour le mieux, mis à part un peu d’boucan
Un contrôle inopiné ce qu’on appelle un changement d’ambiance
A la base, ils étaient venus nous demander d’bouger
Refus d’obtempérer, contrôle d’identité
Comme d’habitude, faut toujours qu’y en ait un qui s'branle qui jacte
Comme chez nous, faut toujours qu’y en ait un pour les ficha
Ce soir là, y’avait l’poto qui dormait dans sa caisse
Réveillé pour donner sa pièce, contrôle alcootest
Il avait bu, il avait mal garé son 307
Brutalisé sous l’me-seu du capitaine et ses collègues
Manque de pot la mif est grande, y’avait 2 d’ses frelons
Ça part en couilles de tous les tés-cô, outrage et rébellion
Strangulations, balayettes, patates dans la mâchoire

Moi je suis l'un des mecs les plus endettés de toute la capitale
Le dernier chrome que j'ai pris pour ma con
Je crois que c'était tout à l'heure
Hum manque de neurones je sais même plus à qui je dois de l'oseille
Il manque deux euros laisse la moi khey soit pas mauvais

Hey hey hey non j'te le laisserai pas, dégage
Dégage, deux euros, sale?

Mais si tu veux même
Je te fais la même scène
Que dans Menace II Society, oui, je te suce la

T'es sérieux là
Allez vas-y casse-toi, j'vais te défoncer
(Attend, attend, reviens reviens) Non non t'énerves pas
Tranquille je me tire ailleurs
A la recherche d'un mec qui voudra un peu moins tiraille
Il m'faut du beef vite
J'ai les poches vides
Même pas d'quoi faire un stick
J'm'étais juré de n'plus faire le, le keusse de la daronne
Des moments incontrôlables khey tu l'fais même si t'as reup
Ou arracher un sac d'une vieille sur l'point de mourir
Bref tout un tas d'bêtises où j'laisse sheitan me nourrir
La drogue me donne des ailes
Mais en vrai celles-ci sont cassées
Tout stopper, atterrir, inchallah dès que j'ai l'occasion

La drogue te donne des ailes, tu frôles le ciel
Ce n'est qu'un plaisir à temps partiel
Tes joues se creusent
La fumée cerne tes cernes
T'es dans un océan de conseils
La coke te donne des ailes
Le shit te donne des ailes
L'ectasy fait le même job

Le toxico recherche un plaisir
Sans fournir d'efforts
Il est dans l'noir une fois sur deux
Comme si l'soleil clignait des yeux
Tes veines te grattent ça devient alarmant
D'un coup tu fonds en larmes
Le manque de drogue s'acharne
Tu vends le lait du marmot
Pour elle tu peux tout flinguer
Quitte à flinguer l'frangin
J'répète tu peux tout flinguer
Flinguer l'frangin vendre tes fringues
Tu travailles en tant que top model
Tu vis grâce à c'corps de rêve
Pas question d'lui faire des séquelles
Donc tu t'piques entre les orteils
Seul la rue t'héberge
Tu sniffes des pers'
Sur l'avant bras plus aucune veine
C'est pas grave tu t'piques la verge
Au réveil ton visage tombe
Tes lèvres sont sèches
Pas besoin de préciser
Que Monsieur est dans la hass
Les gens t'écartent ils te détestent
T'es négligent donc tu empestes
Espèce de, tu incarnes la peste
Les mêmes chemins les mêmes gestes
Les mêmes seringues la même sieste
Le même stresse
La mort arrive et tout ça cesse!

La drogue te donne des ailes, tu frôles le ciel
Ce n'est qu'un plaisir à temps partiel
Tes joues se creusent

Karim Fall,"Les nymphos aiment faire les courses parce qu'il y'a souvent une queue immense 
J'vis dans une monde où certains hommes prennent la mort pour délivrance 
C'est pas en faisant tourner les joints que cette putain d'roue va tourner 
Oukhty (ma soeur), respecte ton vagin car c'est par là qu'on est tous né 
Si on jette pas de fleurs au Darfour, c'est que là-bas c'est la sécheresse 
Les députés ont des langues de putes car beaucoup d'eux sont des lèches-fesses 
Celle que t'aime dévoile la haine dans un miroir fissuré 
Si l'occident pouvait se salir c'est sur l'Afrique qu'il s'essuierait 
J'comprend pas qu'des riches soient gros vu qu'y'a pas d'fric sans suer 
Et comment ils en sont arrivés à trouver une petite fille sensuelle 
Ils doivent se faire monter en l'air pour mieux redescendre sur terre 
On veut tous reposer en paix, pour ça que tout l'monde est en guerre 
Et si la coke est claire c'est qu'elle doit s'prendre dans la nuit noire 
Et si mes pensées sont claires c'est qu'elle est pas encore venue m'voir 
J'avais grave des idéaux, j'ai vu trop d'choses donc j'ai dis « oh » 
J'serais pas l'idiot qui s'baisse chaque jour pour chier et qui s'dit oh 
J'ai pas d'sous et plein d'soucis, une envie fou de s'mettre sous weed 
Bien que la rue soit en béton elle construit pas de mecs solides 
Si l'temps était de l'argent les clochards seraient pressés 
Plus j'prend conscience de la mort plus mon avenir rétréci

J'suis cultivé mais pour la France analphabète 
JR Ochrome a.k.a. la dernière lettre de l'alphabet 
Décevant comme mon statut social 
Délinquant donc pas très fréquentable 
J'guette mon affaire les yeux plissés sur une jambe 
Jongle avec les flammes Rindek (Attention) à pas glisser sur d'l'essence 
Akhi j'suis aussi noir que le tié-quar que j'fréquente 
Si j'te disais que son bitume est cagoulé qu'est-ce que t'en penses ? 
Réfléchis vite quand une bande déboule 
Infériorité numérique ça tue ou ça s'mange des coups 
La rue c'est réaliste en gros c'est crue ter les gars d'chez nous 
Si j'me définissais moi j'serais l'enclume dans un gant d'velours 
Postiché comme des C.R.S. 
On s'fait la guerre on s'fait la gueule quand c'est la hass 
J'cogite régulièrement pour mailler y'a pas d'magie 
Le ghetto t'joue des tours à la David Copperfield 
Paris Centre 75 plus d'une fois j'ai bu la tasse 
Chez moi ça marche rabbate à reculons dans une impasse 
Moi j'reviens d'loin, des keufs des shayatine (diables) sur les côtes 
Avec un p'tit arrière gout d'sucre sur le dos

T'as les poches pleines tu crois p'tet que ton cake sent le Givenchy 
Mais saches que même sur les plus beaux monuments les pigeons chient 
Ce monde est éphémère tout ce qui s'y trouve péri 
Et si t'aimes tant la vie c'est parce qu'elle te camoufle ses rides 
On m'a dit « jettes toi à l'eau » j'ai bu la tasse 
J'ai voulu remonter à bord y'avait plus la place 
Là j'ai compris qu'ici souvent c'est chacun pour soi 
Limite on t'dit « si t'es pas venu pour m'faire un chèque pousses toi » 
J'ai trop ché-mar j'ai des fourmis dans les iepds 
J'me prend une nouvelle paire si j'peux m'les fournir sans les yaip (payer) 
Oui j'ai tourner dans les iefs (fiefs) j'ai p'tet manger plus de 100 tiep 
J'ai vu que ceux qui n'ont rien partagent et que les riches sont sans tièp (pitié) 
J'veux pas finir en iench à quatre te-pa 
Quand la richesse tente de nous phone ici on capte pas
Tu veux diriger ta vie mais t'as pas la clef d'contact 
C'est pour compter leur tune qu'ils t'ont nommé comptable 
Poto, t'es seul avec ou sans amis 
L'amitié perd de sa valeur comme un pain sans sa mie 
Bref, tout ça pour dire qu'en résumé [en résumé] 
Elle fait flipper la race humaine [elle fait flipper la race humaine *3] 

J'essaye de grimper l'échelle sociale avec une jambe de bois 
Je n'attend rien d'une courte échelle vu la hauteur d'mes ambitions 
Dur de démarrer la course avec une paire de Atemi 
Quel âge à celui qui dit qu'avec le temps la douleur s'atténue 
C'est dur de réussir sa vie tout comme de rater sa mort 
Certains me disent depuis le temps que tu fais du rap ça mors ? 
J'ai beau leurs dire qu'on est pas sorti de l'auberge 
Tellement j'en chie de loin tu peux même sentir l'odeur 
Un quart de vie passé avec des sparadraps c'est pas un drame 
On s'barre à Dam attendre le prochain paragraphe 
Akhi, on m'avait dit que la France était un eldorado 
Dès l'atterrissage ils m'ont collé un poisson d'avril dans l'dos 
Les années passent les saisons changent 
Les problèmes viennent plus des cours de maths mais d'avoir la peau mâte 
Comment prouver qu'j'suis oppressé les chaines sont invisibles 
Les mecs s'efforcent de faire dans l'subtile mais restent prévisibles 
Mes gars n'ont plus la forme humaine 
A contresens sur un circuit de formule 1 
Ferme la et range tes formulaires, j'vais te l'formuler 
Autrement j'te l'dis fermement j'veux pas faire l'mulet 

J'suis là pour dénoncer pas là pour faire l'pantin 
C'est plus des carottes qu'on s'mange mais des bananes Plantin 
Belek au sourire d'une femme à cause d'elle tu peux perdre le tien 
La trahison nous fait pâlir jusqu'à en perdre le teint 
Pas d'noirs à la télé si c'n'est pour le Sida 
Et l'seul kain-fry qui a la côte chez Disney c'est Simba 
M'invite pas à table j'suis pas dans mon assiette 
Pas l'habitude des couverts nous on partage un bol à 7 
On m'a dit qu'en grandissant la voisine serait moins souriante 
Qu'avec ou sans dents de lait si c'est la hass les souris entrent 
Que rien n'est sûr chaque être humain est en sursis 
C'qui est sûr c'est que chaque paire de fesses qui passe c'est un souci 
Les p'tits peuvent pas arracher les curs ils sont passés au keus 
Et si la nuit porte conseil, bah elle a zappé les geush 
En résumé crois pas que le temps chôme 
Si le monde te sourit akhi saches qu'il a les dents jaunes 
J'aimerai effacé le numéro de tout mes frères écroués 
Mais dans c'monde rien n'est parfait akhi même la lune est trouée 
J'ai les mains sur le cur, les pieds au sol et la tête vers les cieux 
Donc dîtes aux travelos que j'les appellerai toujours Messieurs 

Paname est vivante mon quartier réside dans son zen 
Quand elle éternue, les bicraveurs tombent et prennent du ferme 
Le monde est subtile, saches que c'est pas la taille qui compte 
Car si le président est un nain bah devant lui tu parais si p'tit 
Panam est un chien sans maître donc fuck l'éducatrice 
Moi, j'suis né dans l'creux d'une cicatrice 
Akhi, tu veux des frissons ? touches moi 
Martin Luther King a fait un rêve et Maître Gims a fait un cauchemar 
Tu trouves ça gore et alors ? 
Censurez moi ça changera rien comme un aveugle dans l'noir 
J'suis foutu, caractère de base têtu 
L'être humain n'est que du sperme vêtu 
Les mécréants voudraient voir Dieu 
Essayes d'abord de regarder le soleil dans les yeux
J'me demande plus quand tout ça cessera 
Marre de m'battre pour un quartier qui porte le nom d'un ciste-ra 
Puis ça m'fait chier 
Donc si une meuf me plaît de trop bah je l'imagine en train d'chier 
J'vise la tête j'ai plus le temps pour les essais 
Et si le monde t'ouvre ses bras bah saches
Qu'il fouette des aisselles
Fouette des aisselles, fouette des aisselles

Moi inch'Allah j'vais pas repartir comme j'suis arriver
En faisant souffrir la daronne encore pire la voir crier 
On ira tous au paradis n'est qu'une chanson d'Enfoirés 
Et tes et tes hassanets ils s'trouvent pas dans tes putains d'soirées
Rien ne marche depuis mes premiers pas
J'me lève tout les jours du pied gauche comme si on m'avait amputé du droit 
Les les qui à dit qui au bled c'est la santé 
Quoi l'argent n'a pas d'odeur tu mens je l'ai senti 
Stop y'a ton gars sûr qui joue au con 
Dis lui qu'il est suivi du regard et que c'est pas celui de la Joconde 
Y'a celui qui mord la vie et celui qui vit la mort 
Dans les deux cas personne peut ves-qui son heure
La beauté de l'homme est dans sa poche 
Si t'es milliardaire t'as l'droit d'être moche 
Religieux que quand ça t'chantes 
Mais les vrais religieux ne chante pas 
Comme d'hab ils diront que les kain-fry divaguent 
Eux ils lisent des livres alors qui y'en a qu'un qui dit vrai
Si l'argent tombait du ciel, ciel ciel ciel
L'avare tiendrait son parapluie à l'envers sans hésiter

Karim Fall,"Il avait 19 ans, elle avait la quinzaine
Lui c'était pour un soir elle pour une vie mais ce n'était qu'un jeune
Lui aimait les femmes et arrondir son biff en fin de mois
Fan de formes courbées plus de vingt conquêtes en 5 mois
Elle fan de feuilletons, pensée qu'il allait assumer
Lui pensait plutôt combien de spliff il avait à fumer
Et a quels sapes il mettrait pour ses soirées dansantes
Pendant qu'elle flippait de dire qu'elle était enceinte
Et quand elle lui dit qu'elle était en cloque
Il s'énerva, lui mit une claque, disant 'Tes preuves sont en toc'
Il frappa dans son ventre en disant 'Casse-toi c'est pas moi le père!'
Je peux pas porter ce lourd poids j'préfère celui de mes haltères!

Je suis tout petit, je prends pas beaucoup de place

Papa mais t'étais où?
Le jour où je suis né
Aujourd'hui maman ne cesse de me dire qu'on a le même gros nez
J'ai vu une photo d'elle et d'un homme, jeune épanouie
Elle avait le même regard qu'elle porte sur moi, seule ébahie
Papa! Elle te connaît, elle te déteste je sais
Moi c'est pire je te connais pas et je te déteste tu sais
Mais t'étais où?
Le jour de mes 1 ans, mes premiers pas, quand j'comprenais rien
Mes années passent et devant l'école
Le père d'Alpha vient toujours me dire 'Bonjour' franchement il est cool
Et en classe, de quoi j'ai peur et honte à ton avis?
Une question très très gênante, 'Qu'est-ce que ton père fait dans la vie?'
Dans quelques jours j'aurai 8 ans
Je suis le joker de mon club de foot qu'on fait rentrer à la mi-temps
Tel père tel fils, rien que pour ce point commun,
Mais pour devenir un homme, je fais comment?

Papa je comprends pas je t'ai fait quoi
Je suis tout petit, je prends pas beaucoup de place

Poto je te parle d'un papy, qu'a presque 100 ans
C'est devant la fenêtre de sa chambre qui passe tout son temps
Il est devenu dingue te diront les infirmières
Elles ont besoin de la chambre, elle le préférerait au cimetière
Les psychanalystes multiplient les analyses mais banalisent son cas puis
Négligent la haine qu'il canalise
Ses membres se paralysent, seul il prépare la liste
Des biens qu'il léguera à son fils
Pendant que celui-ci se barre à Nice
L'enfoiré est devenu généraliste
Il a une femme, des gosses, écrit tout au?
Mais, il a foutu son père en maison de retraite
C'est pour ça que je lui souhaite, qu'on le jette dans une maison de traître
Des fois la nuit, ses pensées quitte l'hospice
Il se rappelle de quand au lit son gosse pissait
Il se rappelle du centre commercial
Et des flaques de larme qu'il laissait au sol quand il chiale
Toute sa vie il a, supporté ses caprices
Aujourd'hui la seule qui le visite c'est la rééducatrice
Il voulait sa villa, ses pauses sous Pastis
Maintenant pour pioncer des cachetons faut que tu lui en passes 10",Tel père tel fils,2010

Ta mère ou elle?

À en réveiller les morts

Tous mes amis se le disent encore
J'écoute le son du temps qui passe
J'essaie d'apprendre de nos erreurs
Je souris quand tu m'embrasses
Et je pleure, tu me brises le cœur
Quand j'entends les cloches qui sonnent
Tout le monde se questionne
Et si la raison m'abandonne
Et bien je me le redis encore

Et même au jour le plus court, la nuit ne tombera jamais
Sous les étoiles et le ciel qui se couvrent ensemble
Ah ah ah ah
Et si le vent qui tourne gonfle nos voiles, nous partirons
Sous la pluie qui s'en mêle et sur le sol qui tremble, décembre, ah

Et malgré le niveau de l'eau qui monte
Il me reste encore la mer à boire
Et si je meurs avant la fin du monde
Et bien je connais déjà l'histoire
Quand j'entends tous les laissés-pour-compte acceptant leur sort
Je connais très bien tout ce qu'ils me racontent
Tous mes amis me le disent encore
Les yeux remplis de glaciers qui fondent
Comme un animal à l'abattoir, traversant l'hécatombe
Je connais déjà la fin de l'histoire
Quand j'entends les armées qui s'affrontent au corps à corps dans le noir
Au son des balles et mastodontes
Sous une pluie de météore

Même si t'as pas fait ton sac, même si rien n'est vraiment prêt
Est-ce que c'est tes jambes ou la Terre entière qui se met à trembler?
Affronte le danger, ou soit raisonnable et cours te planquer
Le froid du grand Nord, piéger dans un dernier temps mort
Inutile de rêver d'encore, attends que l'éternité t'emporte
Oublie l'avenir et ses plans, va dire au revoir à la ville et ses gens
Mais n'ai pas peur de partir en décembre
On s'en ira ensemble

Et même au jour le plus court, la nuit ne tombera jamais

Karim Ouellet,"Je vous ramène dans le temps
Pour quelques instants
Vous dévoiler des faits
Qu’on n’apprend pas forcément
Je vous entretiens d’une autre histoire
Celle qu’on ne voit pas dans les cours
Amérindiens et les Noirs
Celle qu’il faut remettre à jour
Par où commencer
Pour vous dire comment c’est
D’abord faut nuancer
L’Histoire est romancée
Manipulée
Elle est écrite par les vainqueurs
Dont une partie dissimulée
Les hypocrites ne datent pas d’hier
Back in the days
autour de 1604
Champlain débarque
Avec à son bord un Black
Mathieu Da Costa
dit l’Interprète
Il parlait micmac
Français et hollandais
En 1629
Arrive Olivier Lejeune
Premier esclave répertorié
dans la jeune ville de Québec
Au moins 10 000 esclaves
au Canada
Jusqu’à l’abolition de ce droit
en 1833
C’est fou
À force de fureter en masse
J’ai découvert que Lionel Groulx
Prônait la pureté des races
C’est la même pour Garneau
F.X.-Garneau
Québec History X
Ils nous ont effacés du tableau
Mais pourtant
Il y avait des hommes d’affaires noirs
On était dans les régiments
et d’autres étaient coureurs des bois
Il y avait aussi des aubergistes
Et ils veulent nous faire croire
que les Noirs sont ici
depuis les années 70
1779
Pointe-du-Sable Jean-Baptiste
Un métis antillais
À fondé un poste de traite en Illinois
Nowadays on l’appelle Chicago
Un Black francophone a fondé Chicago
Jackie Robinson
Oliver Jones
et Oscar Peterson
La liste est longue
mais pas tant que ça
Trop de héros oubliés
qui ont contribué à notre passé
Mais peu veulent le souligner

400 ans d’histoire
6 millions de raisons
de nous faire oublier de croire
et puis se souvenir
C’est tout ce que j’ai peur de devenir
Quand on y pense 10 minutes
L’ignorance diminue

Au 19e siècle
C’est pas du tout fini
Ils ont envoyé les Chinois
faire les chemins de fer dans tout le pays
Détonateurs vivants
On les envoyait creuser la roche
Avec de la nitroglycérine
Et ça sautait à leur approche
Le pâté chinois
ça vient de là
Bœuf, maïs et patate
Tout ce qu’on retrouve dans le Westside
Entre toi pis moi
Ça n'a rien d’oriental
C’est une mixture qu’on leur donnait
Pour les nourrir en tas
Maintenant les Indians
Ah les Indians
Man, ils l’ont eu bad
Les Indians
Genocide à grande échelle
À trop grande échelle
La mémoire des Amériques
Est à jamais entachée
Les premières armes bactériologiques
On leur donnait des couvertures
Imbibées de variole
Tu vois la suite
Un choc microbiologique
et viol culturel
Être vu en étranger
sur sa propre parcelle
De terre ancestrale
C’est l’ère industrielle
qui fait qu’encore au 21e siècle
L’âme des ancêtres râle
On parle de colle, de viol
et d’alcool dans les fioles
Le haut taux de suicide
démontre un fuckin' ras-le-bol
Dans les réserves
Je comprends qu’il en ait qui aille s’attaquer
Au gouvernement
Comme dans le temps à Kanesatake",QC History X,2010

J'ai grandis là où sommeillent toutes les révolutions 
Entre des hommes en retard et des môme qu'aiment pas jouer 
Père-fille on connait le blème mais pas la solution 
Des dettes et un apparte qu'on ne peut même pas louer 

Que veux tu qu'j'te dise 
J'aurais pu écrire une parodie 
Écrire une parodie 
Ouais ma vie une page que t'as déjà lue 
J'aurais pu écrire une parodie 

Besoin de maille pour grailler 
Il n'aimait pas ma compagnie 
J'ai du pour y palier 
Des fois même la faire rouler 
Une envie folle de me tailler 
Où le bonheur ne ferait pas tant de manières 
Loin de ce nid de fous 
Où la haine me roucoulait 

Toujours la même chanson 
Pourquoi écrire une parodie 
Juste une parodie 
Ouais ma vie une page que t'as déjà lue 
Ma life serait une parodie 
Juste une parodie 
Ouais ma vie une page que t'as déjà lue 


Personne dans ce monde ne connait sa fin 
Souvent tu me l'dis aujourd'hui le savoir 
L'homme s'écrit chaque matin 
Et si je l'prends bien 
Ma life n'aura rien de la parodie 

Oui ma life est une ode 
Un conte trop mal raconté 
Ode par classique 
Puis victoire compéte 
Des fautes à chaque page 
Qui ose n'y échappe pas 
Ok c'est facile le vivre c'est se tromper 
Pas côté, africaine écrite en français 
Ma life est dopée, s'affiche sous deux enseignes 
Cri sans fin étouffé tout en grandissant 
Poussez vous ça risque d'être puissant 

Je n'écrirai pas de parodie 
Oh non pas de parodie 
Ma vie une page que t'as jamais lue 
N'est pas une parodie 
Juste une parodie 
Ma vie une page que t'as jamais lue 
Je n'écrirai pas de parodie 
Oh non pas de parodie

I have learnt
There are other sides to learn
The story's heard
And there are winners first
And there are betters worse
And there are listeners
Who are never hurt
And at the end of all of this

At last, I'll stand and I'll shout
Our glory days are over
They're over
At last, I'll stand and I'll shout
Our glory days are over
They're over

No, I can't turn that page for you
But I can't lie
I love you, cause that I do

Along in just to belong
To live today like tomorrow's gone
And they are weak but strong
Who fail but carry on
And if one thing's short for something
They are never wrong
And at the end of all of this

Karima Francis,"I woke up this morning wondering how I gotten here
I pulled it together cuz I said I would yes I said I
Will
Now I'm on a pavement I pretend that I am one of them
Am I only famous with my fancy house and the horse in
My garden
Wherever I go each moment away I'm missing you more
Than I can say
When I'm not at home I'm still in love with you
Now brother I'm sorry when I'm out here I work very
Hard
And for your next birthday we'll throw fire display, 
Champagne parade
See I don't deserve this not for the traumas I've put
Us through
I know I ain't perfect but I can assure you this
I will make it up to you
Wherever I go each moment away I'm missing you more
Than I can say
When I'm not at home I'm still in love with you
Ohhh

Wherever I go each moment away I'm missing you more
Than I can say
When I'm not at home I'm still in love with you

Wherever I go each moment away I'm missing you more

In my bowl
I want a little sweetness
Down in my soul
I could stand some lovin'
Oh so bad
I feel so funny and I feel so sad

On my clothes
Maybe I can fix things up

Karin Glenmark,"So you got what you want
What a nasty ambition
Set me up, pull me down
Then exploit my condition

I should have guessed, woman
That if pressed, woman
You're on nobody's side but your own
And you're behaving like a mere woman

It's so clear, woman, it's your sex
Once they start getting old and getting worried
They let fly, take it out
On the one who supports them
That's you I'm talking about

Who'd ever think it?
Such a squalid little ending
Watching you descending
Just as far as you can go
I'm learning things I didn't want to know

Who'd ever guess it?
This would be the situation
One more observation
How'd we ever get this far
Before you showed me what you really are?

You'll be lost without me
To abuse like you're used to
Go away, just get out
Be someone else's parasite

I'm not the kind to be vindictive
Holding some childish grudge
How could I be? I'm in the spotlight
Half of the world my judge

All I demand is those I work for
Those I give all my skills
All my time and pain
Those that I entertain
Give me the same compassion in return
But the fools never learn

",Florence Quits,1994
Karin Glenmark,"This is the one situation I wanted most to avoid
Nothing I say will convince him this isn't a trick.
A drink on a clear moonlit night, I relax, she smiles
There's something unpleasant going on

So with immaculate timing, I'm left to carry the can
Embarrassed, outnumbered, marooned

Now she can't be working for them, I mean us
She seems so very straightforward but where is he?
He has to come back, he wanted this meeting, well, didn't he?
Maybe he's scared, just as scared as he was in the game

Oh, I just couldn't care less
He can go right ahead, go and wreck his career
I know I've done my best
Well, at least she's a good looking spy

What if my Russian friend thinks that my plans
Are more of an intimate kind?
If I don't say something and soon
He'll go nobody's on nobody's side

Listen, I hate to break up the mood
Get to the point, begin the begin
Haven't you noticed we're a protagonist short
In this idyllic, well produced scene?

All I can say is moments ago
He was right here ready and waiting
Never mind him, I haven't missed him so far

Maybe it won't do any harm
To struggle on without his charm?
Funny how all at once I feel
That he can go jump off the mountain I won't care

This is the one situation I wanted most to avoid
My dear opponent, I really can't imagine why
So I am not dangerous then? What a shame
Oh, you're not dangerous, who could think that of you?

You, you are so strange
Why can't you be what you ought to be?
You should be scheming
Intriguing, too clever by half

I have to hand it to you for you've managed
To make me forget why I ever agreed to this farce
I don't know why I can't think of anything I would rather do
Than be wasting my time on mountains with you

",Mountain Duet,1994
Karin Krog,"I remember you-ooh
You're the one who made my dreams come true
A few kisses ago

I remember, too, a distant bell and stars that fell
Like the rain out of the blue-ooh-ooh-ooh-hoo-hoo-hoo

When my life is through
And the angels ask me to recall
The thrill of it all
Then I will tell them I remember you-ooh

How did I guess that the long loneliness was past.
I merely looked at you and I knew that I knew.

Now and forever and when forever's done
You'll find that you are still the one

Our summer day withers away
Too soon, too soon.

Speak low when you speak, love,
Our moment is swift, like ships adrift,
We're swept apart too soon.

Speak low, darling speak low,
Love is a spark lost in the dark,
Too soon, too soon,
I feel wherever I go
That tomorrow is near, tomorrow is here
And always too soon.

Time is so old and love so brief,
Love is pure gold and time a thief.
We're late darling, we're late,
The curtain descends, ev'rything ends
Too soon, too soon,
I wait darling, I wait
Will you speak low to me,
Speak love to me and soon.",Speak Low,1981

Let the trumpet call
While the people shout, ""strike up the band""

Calling one and all

Let's have fun, fun, fun

Karin Krog,"Now you say you're lonely
You cried the whole night through
Well you can cry me a river, cry me a river
I cried a river over you

Now you say you're sorry
For being so untrue
Well you can cry me a river, cry me a river
I cried a river over you

You drove me, nearly drove me out of my head
While you never shed a tear
Remember, I remember all that you said
Told me love was too plebeian
Told me you were through with me

And now you say you love me
Well just to prove you do
Come on and cry me a river, cry me a river
I cried a river over you

Go on and cry me a river, cry me a river
I cried a river............over you
