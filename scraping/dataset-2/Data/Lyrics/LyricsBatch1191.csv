Thelonious Monk Quartet,"It begins to tell
'Round midnight, midnight
I do pretty well, till after sundown
Suppertime I'm feelin' sad
But it really gets bad
'Round midnight

Memories always start 'round midnight
Haven't got the heart to stand those memories
When my heart is still with you
And ol' midnight knows it, too
When a quarrel we had needs mending
Does it mean that our love is ending
Darlin' I need you, lately I find
You're out of my heart
And I'm out of my mind

Let our hearts take wings'
'Round midnight, midnight
Let the angels sing
For your returning
Till our love is safe and sound
And old midnight comes around

Thelonious Monk Quartet,"My heart is sad and lonely
For you I sigh, for you dear only
Why haven't you seen it
I'm all for you body and soul

I spend my days in longing
And wondering why it's me you're wronging
I tell you I mean it
I'm all for you body and soul

I can't believe it
It's hard to conceive it
That you'd turn away romance
Are you pretending
It looks like the ending
Unless I could have just one more chance to prove, dear

My life a wreck you're making
You know I'm yours for just the taking
I'd gladly surrender myself to you body and soul

Thelonious Monk Quartet,"I don't want you, but I'd hate to lose you
You've got me in between the devil and the deep blue sea
I forgive you, 'cause I can't forget you
You've got me in between the devil and the deep blue sea

[Repeat: x2]
I ought to cross you off my list
But when you come a-knocking at my door
Fate seems to give my heart a twist
And I come running back for more
I should hate you, but I guess I love you

Thelonious Monk Quartet,"Ever since the lucky night I found you
I've hung around you just like a fool
Falling head and heels in love like a kid out of school.

My poor heart is in an awful state now
But it's too late now to call a halt

So if I become a nuisance it's all your fault!

Don't blame me for falling in love with you
I'm under your spell but how can I help it!
Don't' blame me!

Can't you see when you do the things you do!
If I can't conceal the thrill that I'm feeling,
Don't blame; me.

Ican't help it if that doggoned moon above
Makes me need someone like you to love!

Blame your kiss as sweet as a kiss can be
And blame all your charms that melt in my arms
But don't blame me.

I like every single thing about you
Without a doubt you are like a dream
In my mind I find a picture of us as a team

Ever since the hour of our meeting
I've been repeating a silly phrase
Hoping that you'll understand me one of these days.

Don't blame me for falling in love with you
I'm under your spell but how can I help it!
Don't' blame me!

Can't you see when you do the things you do!

Let's find a cozy spot
To cuddle and coo

What are my arms for?
Use your imagination!

Thelonious Monk Quartet,"The man who only lives for making money
Lives a life that isn't necessarily sunny
Likewise the man who works for fame

There's no guarantee that time won't erase his name
The fact is, the only work that really brings enjoyment
Is the kind that is for girl and boy meant

Holding hands at midnight

'Neath a starry sky

Thelonious Monk Septet,"Abide with me, fast falls the eventide
The darkness deepens, Lord with me abide
When other helpers fail and comforts flee
Help of the helpless, oh abide with me

I need Thy presence every passing hour
What but Thy grace can foil the tempter's power?
Who like Thyself my guide and stay can be?
Through cloud and sunshine Lord abide with me

Hold thou Thy cross before my closing eyes
Shine through the gloom and point me to the skies
Heaven's morning breaks and earth's vain shadows flee
In life, in death oh Lord abide with me
",Abide with Me,1957
Thelonious Monk Trio,"Sweet and lovely sweeter than the roses in May
Sweet and lovely heaven must have sent her my way
Skies above me never were as blue as her eyes
And she loves me, who would want a sweeter surprise
 
When she nestles in my arms so tenderly
There's a thrill that words cannot express
In my heart a song of love is taunting me, melody, haunting me
Sweet and lovely sweeter than the roses in May
And she loves me, there is nothing more I can say

Thelonious Monk Trio,"Oh! Will you never let me be?
Oh! Will you never set me free?
The ties that bound us
Are still around us
There's no escape that I can see
And still those little things remain
That bring me happiness or pain

A cigarette that bears a lipstick's traces
An airline ticket to romantic places
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
A tinkling piano in the next apartment
Those stumbling words that told you what my heart meant
A fair ground's painted swings
These foolish things remind me of you
You came you saw you conquer'd me
When you did that to me
I knew somehow this had to be
The winds of March that make my heart a dancer
A telephone that rings but who's to answer?
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

First daffodils and long excited cables
And candle lights on little corner tables
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
The park at evening when the bell has sounded
The ""Ile de France"" with all the gulls around it
The beauty that is Spring's
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The sigh of midnight trains in empty stations
Silk stockings thrown aside dance invitations
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

Gardenia perfume ling'ring on a pillow
Wild strawb'ries only seven francs a kilo
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
The smile of Garbo and the scent of roses
The waiters whistling as the last bar closes
The song that Crosby sings
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The scent of smould'ring leaves, the wail of steamers
Two lovers on the street who walk like dreamers
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!

To walk and talk and be deceived
I'd give my all and all
And more I would do, oh yeah

If we could dream and buy our dreams
Sew this wicked world up at the seams
I'd give my life and more I would do

All the good times we had together?

I'm taking niggas out the waste
Always rolling up my killa tryna get another million in my safe

Strong enough and hard enough to give you away.

In this big area of mine
Sometimes you break me up inside

Saying I
I want to let you go
Got that feeling
If anyone who comes to know you long enough will give you away.

There was never one as I who could stand the reasons why

Who would even take the time
Did you care
Was I right?
Only once did you try
Even then it was hard enough
Just for you to realize or believe there was only one
Strong enough and hard enough to give you away.

So hard to be alone
I know you were once before
Someone came and opened up the door

And then out you flew
Out you flew and all you saw
Was someone standing with their dreams
Run, run away

In your darkest hour
I will be the only one to send relief
The only chance for you

Suddenly it?s changed
You opened up and find
Something deep inside that tells you
You were the fool to lend yourself

To such amusing games
Take yourself and make your name
And leave you there without your dreams
Run, run away

In your darkest hour
I will be the only one to send relief
The only chance you'll see, run away

In your darkest hour
I will be the only one who knows
Just how to scold you and to say run
In the darkness

And now it?s come to pass
And now we're here at last
I know you sometimes think of me
I know a foolish child would scream

It?s hard to think and hold you tight
It?s hard to be unbending when there's
Everything you've stripped from me
So run, run away

'Cause in your darkest hour
I will be the only one to send relief
The only chance for you, run on

In your darkest hour
I will be the only one who knows
Just how to hold you once again, run on

Then Jerico,"1993, shortly before Thanksgiving
I got the call, she said Jamal Derek is not longer living
Softly she spoke, is this a joke? Man you gotta be kidding
As my question was raised this explanation was given
A meaningless death made me question the meaning of life
Does my body remain at rest like when I'm sleeping at night?
Will I burn in eternal hell or will I find paradise?
Be rejected or resurrected like the body of Christ?
Is it like purgatory, the story described by the Catholics?
Or Nirvana that Buddhists honor in both theory and practice?
Like I study in my college philosophy classes
Or do my molecules and atoms travel back to the gases?
I mean, what I like to know, is where my spirit goes?
After the curtains close, on my final show?
Is there a pain it brings? Enjoy my favorite things?
Visit ancient kings? Hear the angels sing?
Who'll answer these said the great MCs
My man Gribbles battling a debilitating disease
He said you see a brother like me is willing to fight
And everytime I question death my only answer is life

[Chorus]
One life, yeah
And my God will set me free
Am I living in this moment
Am I living righteously
It gets hard
But I know I got to keep on
I'm trying so hard to be strong

Paralyzed on the bathroom floor by pain
Last month I endured, but now I can't ignore
Feels like railroad spikes being stuck in my liver
Am I dying? Eyes crying, body starting to shiver
Crawl upstairs from the basement calling my sister
(Sniff) Dawn help me, I ain't feeling too healthy
Stomach walls burning, head spinning and turning
Waiting for the EMS; 3:10 in the morning
Rush me to the emergency screaming like a newborn
The pain's too strong maybe my soul's trying to move on
They hook me to the I.V., put me through some X-Rays
Gave me Demerol to kill the pain that was the next phase
Early the next day in the hospital room
Moms and pops in the room, three or four docs in the room
Test results suggest your colon and your liver
Is so cancerous you got three months left
Me and Death is playing chess ever since then
My strength is the most high, my fam and close friends
The Last Emp and Set Free blessed me with a verse
Staying healthy comes first
Look at me things could be worst

Does it fade when it gets older

In the Salvation Army pile
And search for something more to meet our needs

I think it's time I rediscover
All the ground that I have covered, like
Seek Ye first what a verse
We are pressed but not crushed,
Perplexed but don't despair.
We are persecuted but not abandoned
We are no longer slaves
We are daughters and sons,
And when we are weak
We are very strong

And neither death nor life
Nor present nor future
Nor depth nor height
Can keep us from the love of Christ

Is the Word that was
Who put on flesh to dwell with us.

Daß einmal ein Wunder geschieht,
Doch wenn wir uns dann verschenken
Ist es das alte Lied:
Nur nicht aus Liebe weinen,
Es gibt auf Erden nicht nur den einen.
Es gibt so viele auf dieser Welt
Ich liebe jeden, der mir gefällt !
Und darum will ich heut' Dir gehören,
Do sollst mit Treue und Liebe schwören,
Wenn ich auch fühle, es muß ja Lüge sein,
Ich lüge auch und bin Dein.
Wir kamen von Süden und Norden
Mit Herzen so fremd und so stumm
So bin ich die Deine geworden
Und ich kann Dir nicht sagen warum.
Denn als ich mich an Dich verloren,
Hab' ich eines anderen gedacht.
So war die Lüge geboren
Schon in der ersten Nacht.
Nur nicht aus Liebe weinen,
Es gibt auf Erden nicht nur den einen,
Es gibt so viele auf dieser Welt
Ich liebe jeden, der mir gefällt !
Und darum will ich heut' Dir gehören,
Do sollst mit Treue und Liebe schwören,

You're waiting for someone to perform with
And don't you know that it's just you, hey Jude, you'll do
The movement you need is on your shoulder

Hey Jude, don't make it bad
Take a sad song and make it better
Remember to let her under your skin
Then you'll begin to make it
Better better better better better better, oh

to see the consolation of Israel
And even though the flame of my life is now growing dim, 
I know I'll see the Savior of Israel
For the Spirit of the Lord has promised unto me 
that I would not see death before my eyes have seen Him
The promise is alive, for through this little child, 
God's holy light illuminates Jerusalem

This child will cause the falling and rising of many souls 
A sign for all the people of Israel 
This child will be the way and the life unto every soul
To every generation shall the Gentiles tell
For the way has been prepared in the sight of every man
The Son of God Himself is born in Bethlehem
A sacrifice is made in the temple on this day
Redemption reaches far beyond Jerusalem

O Bethlehem, your star burns bright tonight, 
for my eyes have seen the glory of salvation's holy light 
Has this little child come to redeem us all? 
To save us from the fall? 
Redemption is in sight 
Behold, the Son shines bright 
under Bethlehem's star tonight

Behold, the Son shines bright
In Bethlehem tonight
In Bethlehem tonight
In Bethlehem tonight
In Bethlehem tonight

When all the world was sleeping deep in darkness
a child in Bethlehem fulfilled the promise
The ancients prophesied a great deliverer
The one to break the curse of sin forever
He didn't come with any worldly fanfare
No royal treatment, just a dark cross to bear
In Bethlehem a brand-new dawn is rising
A star to guide the way, forever shining
New hope was born for all creation that night
For through the darkness came the brightest light
For through the darkness came the brightest light",Bethlehem,2008

All the souls faded to black
I am the one who bled in silence and endured it all
I am the Word who spoke no word
With a thousand angels waiting for my call

Today you have to learn to be a realist.

You may be bent on doing deed of daring due,
But up against a shark, what can a herring do?

Be wise, compromise.
Compromise, and be wise!
Let them think you're on their side, be noncommittal.
I will not bow my head to the men I despise!
You won't have to bow your head to stoop a little.
Why not learn to put your faith and your reliance,
On an obvious and simple fact of science?

A crazy planet full of crazy people,
Is somersaulting all around the sky.
And every time it turns another somersault,
Another day goes by.
And there's no way to stop it,
No, there's no way to stop it.
No, you can't stop it even if you tried.
So, I'm not going to worry,
No, I'm not going to worry,
Every time I see another day go by.

While somersaulting at a cockeyed angle,
We make a cockeyed circle 'round the sun.
And when we circle back to where we started from,
Another year has run.

And there's no way to stop it,
No, there's no way to stop it,

You're a fool if you worry,
Over anything but little number one.

That's I!
And I!
And me!
That all absorbing character.
That fascinating creature.
That super special feature,
Me!

So every star on every whirling planet,
And every constellation in the sky,
Revolves around the center of the universe,
That lovely thing called, I.

And there's no way to stop it.

If I were a biddy biddy rich,

I'd build a big tall house with rooms by the dozen,
Right in the middle of the town.
A fine tin roof with real wooden floors below.
There would be one long staircase just going up,
And one even longer coming down,
And one more leading nowhere, just for show.

I'd fill my yard with chicks and turkeys and geese and ducks
For the town to see and hear.
And each loud ""cheep"" and ""swaqwk"" and ""honk"" and ""quack""
Would land like a trumpet on the ear,
As if to say ""Here lives a wealthy man.""

With a proper double-chin.
Supervising meals to her heart's delight.
I see her putting on airs and strutting like a peacock.
Oy, what a happy mood she's in.
Screaming at the servants, day and night.

The most important men in town would come to fawn on me!
They would ask me to advise them,
Like a Solomon the Wise.
""If you please, Reb Tevye...""
""Pardon me, Reb Tevye...""
Posing problems that would cross a rabbi's eyes!
And it won't make one bit of difference if i answer right or wrong.
When you're rich, they think you really know!

If I were rich, I'd have the time that I lack
To sit in the synagogue and pray.
And maybe have a seat by the Eastern wall.
And I'd discuss the holy books with the learned men, several hours every day.
That would be the sweetest thing of all.

But the days grow short when you reach September
When the autumn weather turns the leaves to flame

September, November
And these few precious days I'll spend with you
These precious days I'll spend with you",September Song [From Knickerbocker Holiday],2006

How's, how's everything

Said you was still looking good
Heh, made me feel kind of good, you know
Told me, told me that you did ask about me

A lot of things that just seemed not to go right
Don't want you to think I'm trying to buy back your love or your friendship
But now I feel I got a chance to kind of make things up to you a little bit
Heh, enough about you and me
How's my little son
Hmm, he ever ask about me
Just a little bit
Does he still like to go down by the supermarket
If I could just
If I could just see you
Can't really say what you mean or what you want over the phone

Now baby I know the difference 
Between right and wrong 
I ain't gonna do nothin'

Cause we only act like children 
When we argue, fuss and fight

I need you... in a desperate way
All the girl, I've met, were so full of play (uh)
Your brown eyes, converted me (son, son, you see her right there)
And let me know (aww she's right) That you're the right girl for me
(I'm feelin' her, right there, son)
(Man, I gotta go talk to her, son, hold on for a minute, son)

[Solomon Childs]
Excuse me, what's good, girl? You look familiar
Was you on the Ron G. ski trip in '95
I see you 'round the way, pushin' you mans Q-45
And watch you and your home girls, get excited
From the blunt smoking, in the Escalade, sittin' on 25's
By the way, where you from? (get 'em) and can I come?
You gigglin' baby, at the same time, jigglin' baby
You like, I like in Queens, don't laugh
But my sisters used to call me a tomboy
And I was born in Providence, small neighborhood
Ain't much not, and use to date Pretty Lou from the Lost Boyz
So captivated by the way you walk, so caught up by the way you talk
Just could imagine, how you scream and moan, ass big as Miss Jones

[Interlude: Solomon Childs (sample)
So I'm sayin', you think we can get together?
Spend a little time with each other and maybe you could (be my girl)
I mean, damn ma, look at how we look together (be my girl)
It's like the way you smilin' right now, you got a brother over (be my girl)
I'm tellin' you, we could probably start somethin' new out this (be my girl)
I'm tellin' you, man

[Solomon Childs]
White snow and the alpine, the kid glide
With a gangsta slide, and your beautiful eyes
We could be the next hottest thing (you know)
Since Pebbles and L.A. Reid, NorthFace snow suits
With custom made Menolo ski's
First of all girl, I know you need 24-7 time (it's only right)
But I'm a hustler, man, I play the blocks too much
And know how you yearn for a thugs touch
Crazy, as gorgeous as you is, you don't even ask for much
A Corona with a lemon and a Dutch (right)
Pina Coladas when the beach get hot
Cover girl, you got my stomach all caught up in knots
Street rebel or not, put it like this
We got somethin' called Ghetto Love insurance
So you keep it faithful to your boo
And your boo, will keep faithful to you

[Outro: Solomon Childs (sample)]
And then maybe, you can (be my girl)
I'm tellin' you ma, your home girls is even gonna like me (be my girl)
Even your moms, your aunties, your nana (be my girl)
They all gonna dig us, they gon' like how we look (be my girl)
They gonna know what's up with the chemistry (be my girl)
For real, so I'm sayin', so I'm sayin', so I'm sayin' (be my girl)

I'll take you on

That nigga's twisted
Stop playin' with that clip man
Close them fuckin blinds too man, why'knahmsayin?
Yo Don my man, get out of the stove man
Get away from the stove nigga
Stop playin' man, the fuck is you talkin' 'bout?

I'm in the crib watchin' Larry King Live, the new Guccis on
Refrigerator, smokin' some kush, this nigga's a lighter
Swisher, becomin' a roach, go get the glass ashtray
Pour the glass of Crut, tap the bottle then toast
Barrie took a sip for the cause, yeah my son
Soon to be 3, tried to fill his bottle then run
Then I got a collect call, heard niggaz down the block is fightin'
Some nigga got, knifed up brawlin'
Heard the kid was 19, Lil' Infinity too
His father worked up at the dealer he loved boo
They tried him for his Louis', son wasn't havin' it though
Yeah, yeah my nigga, the color of glue
Decided on a intervene, guess who tried to wild on me my nigga
This is like out of the blue
I'm in the Range stretch, jumped out, tucked the chain
Proceeded to talk to him, then you heard the heavy face slap
Think I broke my wrist, now I'm at the hospital vexed
Fucked up my writing hand, that's my check
Now I wanna kill this lil' nigga true
Only thing that stop my gun flamin' 'cause he related to you

Who? He ain't related to me
Just that I knew him for like 18 years until he violated, stealin' my gear
If my lil' homey, yo he eat anything for me
Send him uptown, he get bagged, yo he never call me
Come home and still blow cats for me
Pump crack, stabbin' all them hoodrat shorties
A live gunslinger well known, born to dance
When the heat is on, Stapleton days, shoot hisself in the groin
The gun went off, it looked like a flick
When he fell to the floor, holdin' his nuts, screamin' ""God dammnit
Shit I put one in my balls, what the fuck y'all lookin' at me for?
Call the police, do somethin'
Motherfuckers standin' around, watch when I get better
All hell's gonna be terror
Death to you, you,"" he pointed at Red
I said chill that's fam duke
He put real work in that make you cute, fuck that

Theodore Unit,"Ah-yo
Here's a little story ghetto situation
'Bout a girl I met who had many temptations
She was so fly, get high, well understood
Big-a** big brains and straight out the hood

[Ghostface]
Yo,
Ah-yo, I woke up early took a stretch and a yawn
Had a 2 o'clock appointment with this girl name Dawn
She ain't the Avon lady but her beauty was strong

Right before she went to rest she had me singin this song
She must be a special lady
And a very exciting girl
I don't know

She had the high-glow's switchin
See her in the club you hear others chicks b****in
But Dawn quit to bust a b**** a** and s***
See she did 12 months over a ratchet

Not no crab s***
Got bagged with the mag
Taxi cab s***
Clit was hangin out her panties with no where to stash it

It was cla**ic
Nowadays she's laid back
Helpin me perfect my rap
Only pink and smoked salmon where she feed her cat

Wife everything
Diamond cut like johnny lex collar attached
Lickin gla** bowls in her cat clothes
'Cause crazy stacks

Finicky thing
Her kittin drink pollar spring
Take naps
Near her jewerly box

She play with all the rings
And when she step out the tub its like an ill flick
Caramel skin, bath and body works leave the whole room lit
Cinnamon candles, sweet side, they on relax mode

Paint her toes on the bed slow, watchin me
Versace robe on her body, peak, sippin asti (piemonte)
She a perfect 10 in my wildest dreams DAWN

[Cappadonna]
Ah-yo, she gotta be gone
Waitin on my sweet strawbeery pecan rican LaShawn
Holdin my taffy down when I'm gone
Three fourths of her body always covered with clothes

That's why I'm eatin her candy
And suckin her toes
Sweet sexy LaShawn
She got body like what's goin on

On some marvin gay s*** like lets get it onnnnn
Sugar
Let's get it on
Ah-yo she a diamond in the rough

Black rose in the hood
I love my queen and she treat me good
F*** cookin for me
She stash me out when the feds come lookin for me

I'm not cheatin on her or beatin on her
I spend the weekend on her
We on the block when the bills start creepin on her
She right there when it gets sticky

She strict politic to the vicky's
And a fly aviator the color of sky
God on her side

Indian chick with cat eyes
Mad respect with the fat thighs
Plus her guns for the revolution
Would straight leave her if she prostituting

Yo my girls the bomb
Intelligent mind
Sky blue louis vetton
Leg muscles, deep dimples

Body is soft she smell fresh like a new born
Pretty feet peitete a** nice shoes on
The sunshine for my quiet storm
Keepin the food warm while I'm gone

It won't be long 'til I'm back to my sweet butter pecan rican LaShawn
Hit me up baby, P.S. Cappadon'

[Trife]
Ah-yo, ah-yo I woke up in the morning still drunk off the Henn
Had a 3'oclock appointment with this girl name Jen
You know Jen from a hundred and ten, she push the Lex Coupe
Part time fashion designer she work for Jet Blue

Pretty young thing, with a body like vida
A** off the meter, eva medenez look, strut like a diva
Leave her shine fine, blow minds like dimes of a cheeba
She like it from behind, slow grind, sometimes with her feet up

Ms. Bonitta Applebum Bottom, thick as a Roman column
Raw dick it down, love me, even if I'm holdin condoms!
'Cause she my b****, the only cat that I lick
Throwin that a** like Ciara on the top of that whip

Latin decent, velour suit with the cameltoe print
Peppermint flared panties with the garder-belt clips
Tattoo of a small butterfly on her inner thigh
Even at my loneliest times you that Jen will ride...

Theola Kilgore,"I told you when I met you
I just couldn't give you
The love you needed
I told you I still loved him
And you couldn't thrill me
The way that he did
I said that he would always be
The only man in the world for me
But baby

It's gonna be all right
It's gonna be all right
The love you've shown me
Has made it so easy to forget about him
You made me see
I could live without him

When my heart was filled with sadness
How soothing it was having you to go to
The tender love you offered
Was something that I just couldn't say no to
From just a spark my love has grown
Now it burns for you alone
And I know

It's gonna be all right 
It's gonna be all right
The love you've shown
has made it so easy to forget about him
You came and led me
out of darkness and into light
and I know baby
It's gonna be all right

Uh stank ya smelly much
But this is the only hairy bush I would like to put my lips on
I like that pussy Brazilian waxed with the lips showin'
Tip toe in the high heels or her bare feet and she down for some major dick blowin'
How many licks does it take to get to the bottom of tootsie roll (Yup)
Pop goes the weasel when I explode in her mouth boy that's cold
'Er than Shaquille O'Neal from the free throw line
And I'm a peaceful person so she wanted to give me piece of mind
Now it appears that I am brain dead
My legs feel like Joe from Family Guy because she got insane head
Call me crazy but nowadays it seems like nothing is sacred
Oh well, I already got me somebody to play with

Never would expect to see this,
It's fit to say I could not believe my eyes,
You cracked a smile but had nothing to say,
So I made a list of on how you're gonna pay!

I locked you out,
Left you naked in the front yard,
Burned all of your clothes,

Now I'm on the run,

When I caught you in the act wearing nothing but a little smirk!

Now I feel better,
But it's hard to forget,
I never think of looking back,
Cause time has no meaning when your free,
Oh, this is what you get,

Now I see who you really are,
Cause happiness is the best revenge,

There's always something in your way

Was it the guilt in you that pushed me to improve?
I know you've always had the choice to hear
You gave it all up when you broke the thought
Of keeping away the things you bought
When you took common sense so serious

This time around you're coming closer
You're never coming back until you know its over
Won't you take it away from me?
Just take it all
Cause you never know you're leaving until its over

And its not that its too hard to try to turn your eyes and drive the pain away
Its how much easier it is to let it stay
Once again its on the tip my tongue

Your the mate that fate had me created for 
And every time your lips meet mine

Down and down I go

Your feathers and the crown, the symbols of your strength
Taus (in) your follower's dance

The offspring of Azrael - Accused as apostates
But they're blessed by Mele al Kawat, aks whose guest shall the Sanjak be?

Melek Taus

Sheik Adi, Yezi - Say Hol hola!
The Peacock Lord is here, the Serpent King will rise

Seven angels, seven Seihs - Waiting on Mount Lalesh
Until the day theay hear you pronounce: ""As behre Azide Sarum!""

Hear the Peacock Lord declare: ""Don't say my secret name!
I was, am now and shall have no end...you will know me as Melek Taus""

One day in (the) Maya calendar
The Winter Solstice is open
Like a gate to the Plumped Serpent
For the Maya and the Toltec he return

Sol volverá, en la costa vimos su luz

Oh Seáor del Sol!

Ride on Quetzalcoatl and you will reach another day
When Capricon will change the world
Enter into 2012

Therion,"In ancient days of Khem
A Pharao was praising
The sun above Amon
Osiris, Mother Isis and Thoth

The gods would punish the hybris of Pharao
He wrapped himself in false sunshine
He was the founding father of the only God
But he provoked a fit of rage

Son of the Sun, it was his name
Son of the Sun, the sun will burn your wings
Son of the Sun, beware of Aton
Son of the Sun, your God will let you down

The Sphinx burst into tears
And pyramids are shaking
The precipice is close
When Pharao is losing his faith

Visions of madness led the Pharao astray
The portents were too ominous
Until this day his curse is still the plague of Man
We must defeat the only God

Son of the Sun, it was his name
Son of the Sun, the sun will burn your wings
Son of the Sun, beware of Aton
Son of the Sun, your God will let you down

Apep will rise
Apep will come

Son of the Sun, it was his name
Son of the Sun, the sun will burn your wings
Son of the Sun, beware of Aton
Son of the Sun, your God will let you down

Therion,"Typhon is alive. Descending with allies
From the mountain of the snake. In the deepest night of Pan
Typhon will return. With Erebus and Nyx
And a vision of the storm. And the Ocean and Tethys

The Dragon breaks the temple wall
The Flood will drown our gods
Break down the wall
And let another kingdom rise
The castle of Olympia
Is shaking by the storm
The King lost his crown
And now the wall is tumbling down

The creation of the gods. And the order of Mankind

And the empires will fear. All the power of their wrath",Typhon,2004

My radioactive uniform leaves you deformed,
Unify man, woman and little guy,
Visualize, I can design rhymes that symbolize,
Rhymes that intertwine with time lines for 99 lifetimes,
That unwhine to find the minds of mankind to shine 
Define symaly,
Simulate the template of the best made verse,
Innuate to emulate words,
Don't denigrate the trade, reate birth

And guess your illiterate who gets stomped and laughed at

So much pressure in their cell 'till their dome blew up
I'm helpin' the hell boy, the piles compose my frame
And they'll even diss a pain through range
Train the ladder, my flows compose the louder 
For you to ripple down 'till you hit the ground

Giving everything to make this our careers
We’ll hold on forever wanting seconds of fame
Never eating, barely breathing
When gasoline is too much a gallon
Is being in a band a hope worth having
We live in our van we all left home
Forget a shower cuz every hour’s on the road
We’ve been through hell, we’re broke oh well
But we’re having the time of our lives
We’ve been through hell, we’ve got a story to tell
How 5 guys came to conquer the world
We’ve been through hell
People bring us down for no good reason
We gave our whole lives trying only to please them
They can steal our record but we stole their time
Hours wasted, pointless hatred
We do what we want we’ll be living out our dreams

She needs a lot of love and I know this

This misery will never leave
Like birds of a feather I should have known better
She’s the one that I want, the love that I lost
I gave her the world but it wasn’t enough
She’s got me wrapped around her finger

There’s nothing I can do or say to make her change
There’s a girl on my mind she has my heart
And this curse that I’ve got is tearing us apart
She’s all I can’t stand but all I couldn’t stand to lose

So much for happy ever after, you’ll never be guilt free again

Or should I just give up
I’ve been lying here for days in the passenger seat
Over thinking words you said with our song on repeat
Every cell in my body’s asking myself why she isn’t here
Life on the road is all that I know and since she’s not to have and to hold
I’ll close my eyes and pray before I die that one day she will be more than a memory
You say you’re fine about a thousand times
But those are your words not mine so tell me why would you lie
I’ll admit my mistakes I’ll wait as long as it takes

About 93,000,000 miles away, and that's why it looks so small
And even when it's out of sight, the sun shines night and day

The sun gives heat, the sun gives light, the sunlight that we see
The sunlight comes from our own sun's atomic energy

Scientists have found that the sun is a huge atom-smashing machine
The heat and light of the sun come from the nuclear reactions
Of hydrogen,carbon, nitrogen and helium

The sun is mass of incandescent gas, a gigantic nuclear furnace
Where hydrogen is built into helium at a temperature of millions of degrees

I crawled to school each morning, when it occurred to me
That life's just a mood ring we're not allowed to see

With rubber lining the walls
And there's someone always calling my name
He calls when I'm alone
And he calls when I'm not home
And he calls when I'm stuck out in the rain
I'm insane
I'm insane
I'm insane

I know monkey see, but monkey's dead, for you it would be wrong
Put a dime in my jukebox, you'll only hear this song
And it won't be fun for long

With rubber lining the walls

Has he ever gotten writer's block
Or something like the same
He just started talking
Like he was on TV

Whaddaya want from me?""

And a silver guitar
But I politely told the ladies

Because I have to keep my self-respect
I'll never be a star
Since there's just two songs in me
And this is Number Three""",Number Three,1997

Wanting only to lay where I fell

Spoiled my Christmastime
Thoughtless Santa

Was all I asked him for
Down my chimney it came
My one Christmas wish
Landed on my arm and broke it

Spoiled my bankrobbing scheme

Spotted the cast on my arm and they busted me

Its haunted towers rise into the clouds above it
Folks drive in from out of town
To gaze in amazement when they see it

Just outside the gate I look into the courtyard
Underneath the gathering thunderstorm
Through the iron bars, I see the Black Maria
Revolving slowly on its platform
In the topmost tower, a light burns dim
A coiling filament glowing within

The Edison Museum, once a bustling factory
Today is but a darkened, cobweb covered hive of industry
The tallest, widest and most famous haunted mansion in New Jersey

Behind a wooden door, the voice of Thomas Alva
Recites a poem on a phonograph
Ghosts float up the stair, like silent moving pictures
The loyal phantoms of his in-house staff
A wondrous place it is, there can be no doubt
But no one ever goes in, and no one ever goes out

So when your children quarrel and nothing seems to quell them
Just tell them that you'll take them to the Edison Museum

I stood and waiting for a girl I knew at the spot where we agreed to meet
It was four minutes of two

At four of two, I stood waiting for the girl
I was four minutes early for the date we had planned
I was planning to say I was in love with her
Just as soon as she showed for a two o'clock date
And the clock said four of two

At four of two, I was staring into space
She was not yet late, according to the clock
I was feeling nervous so I kept looking up
At the clock sticking out of the side of the building
And it still said four of two

At four of two, I began to feel tired
And I rubbed my eyes, and again I checked the time
It seemed as if the sky was growing dark
But I felt reassured when I looked at the clock
And it still said four of two

I lay my head down on the sidewalk so in case she were coming I would have a better view
But no one was there so I stretched out and closed my eyes for a second or two
It was four minutes of two

At once I awoke to a futuristic world
There were flying cars and gigantic metal bugs
I'd grown a beard; it was long and white
But I knew that the girl would be coming very soon
For though everything had changed, there was still that clock
And it still said four of two",Four of Two,2002

Get the coconut drum kit
For Daisy to play

They Might Be Giants,"I use my outside voice because I have no choice
The barn that I was raised in was constructed out of noise
And now I’m all torn up because my buttercup
Up and gone and left me
Said she finally had enough
Left me here to ruminate on all she can’t admit
And all she can’t explain

I never thought, I never thought
All time what
Things break apart, things break apart

Rolling down the highway
Not a worry in her mind
Here’s a flash card where someone’s written stultify
I take it as a sign
It’s hard to redefine
Same old sad soliloquy
They handed me a broom
The cast has left the room

All time what
Stumble about wrapped in a shroud
All time what
Partly submerged playing a dirge

Defeat defeated defeatlier

That were buried underground

It seems that you were never aware that we were here
You're probably too busy rejoicing in the present
To stop and be reminded of the dark and troubled past

At the thought of things to come

We can confidently know that you'll enjoy a better world
When the evils that we faced
Will at last be laid to rest

When the poisons of the Earth
Are completely neutralized
When the hatred and the lies
Are forever put aside

When the voices of dissent and contradiction all abate
And the peaceful air is filled
With a silent harmony

We can't be certain at the moment of this writing
But surely in the future there'll be no barking dogs
The sound of crying babies will be thankfully forgotten
No more will the chattering classes make a noise
