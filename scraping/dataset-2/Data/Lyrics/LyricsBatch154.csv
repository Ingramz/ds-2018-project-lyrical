DJ Doo-Wop,"To the L, to the Y and the T to the E
So get ready cause I want everybody to say this with me

[Chorus]
Now I cold rock a party in a b-girl stance
I rock on the floor make the fellas wanna dance
I be the shit and it's all good and if you understood

Would you stop scheming and trying to look hard
I'll get my bodyguard, You'll get that booty scarred,
I'm a veteran which means that I've been
In the game too long Since the days of Paper Thin
Way back when I've been putting it down
Ask your homies who's the baddest bitch on this side of town
I float like a butterfly sting like a bee,
Spectacular on the M I C,
I go for broke, Never giving it less than the best
Many years in the game at your request,
You like the rhyme bite if you dare,
I get the paper so I don't care,
Fly that's me the epitome
Of what a real MC is supposed to be,
Fucking you up every time that I drop,
Fuck a bullet baby, I done took your spot
I guide the best and I ride it well
And if you take a look it ain't hard to tell that I

Cold rock a party in a b-girl stance
I rock on the floor make the fellas wanna dance
I be the shit and it's all good and if you understood

Would you back off me and let my skin breathe,
Lyte is everlasting it's hard to believe
I shall prevail cause I'm next to none
Cause I'm claiming no set, don't plan to get down.
Just Brooklyn is where I'm from
But I'm resting in Studio City for the fun,
If you don't understand just say you don't(nah!)
And don't wait for me to explain cause I won't
You see it's in my nature to be the best,
West to East See East to West,
Ready or not I have arrived and I'm live
Showing an MC how to survive.
It's crazy how I get you captured with my tactics,
I got many witnesses who can back this
Ruffnecks from New York to LA
Been down with me since Poor Georgie.
It's '96, it's all about show and prove
And I'm about to make the ill type moves,
I guide the beat and ride it well
And if you take a look it ain't hard to tell that I

Cold rock a party in a b-girl stance
I rock on the floor make the fellas wanna dance
I be the shit and it's all good and if you understood

Would you get out my shit, please let me be,
I don't see why, you KGB
Why you gotta be all up on me like that,
Trying to get over like a fat rat,
But I understand, I'm a woman in the land of hip-hop
And the shit don't stop,
It goes on, on, on, on
You see the shit don't stop till the break of dawn
And now who makes it liver than a hip-hop, scuba diver,
Chillin with a pina colada,
Kidada hooked me up with Tommy now I got a lot of gear
From everywhere that I'd like to share (yeah right!)
But I'd rather do Kani, Don't ask why! 5001, my son gets shit
Done
All on the catwalk, what they've ever done for you
You betta get down with your real crew,
Cause I ride the beat and I ride it well
And if you take a look it ain't hard to tell that I

Cold rock a party in a b-girl stance
I rock on the floor make the fellas wanna dance
I be the shit and it's all good and if you understood

Rock a party and rock a party and rock a
Party int the B- girl stance.",Cold Rock a Party,1997
DJ Doo-Wop,"I've been waiting much too long
To get it on, its the same old song
Now correct me if I'm wrong
I got the hots and got the mic
Steaming like a hundred watts ready to blow a fuse
Yous about to loose if you pass on this I got
The one kiss 
So you can't resist
Now I'm a get you by all means necessary
I'm never secondary
No need to worry 

I ain't gonna settle for no one
I ain't gonna give no reasons to see
And if I give you permission
That only states that I'm ready for you to come on

[Chorus:]
Baby,wait tomorrow
Don't leave
Stay a while boy 
Hear me out
I've been waiting for you
To bring your loving on

(come on 4x)

Oh don't be shy boy come on now
We've talked about this for quite some time
Oh yeah you know you want me to feel it
And I want you so boy don't front
Say you will be mine

[Chorus:]
 
Hot damn now here he come again
I want to share my world let the nigga in
I'm made up with sugar and spice and every thing nice
I got a lot of goodies for a woody wit a hoodie
So tell me are you putting on the pry or what 
Bring out the best in me
Ain't you got no guts
All this time I've been anticipating
Come on love I'm through with the waiting

DJ Doo-Wop,"You know what
I like the playettes
No diggity, no doubt
Play on playette, play on playette
Yo Dre, drop the verse

It's going down, fade to Blackstreet
The homies got RB, collab' creations
Bump like acne, no doubt
I put it down, never slouch
As long as my credit can vouch
A dog couldn't catch me ass out
Tell me who can stop when Dre makin' moves
Attracting honeys like a magnet
Giving 'em eargasms with my mellow accent
Still moving this flavor
With the homies Blackstreet and Teddy
The original rump shakers

Shorty get down, good Lord
Baby got 'em up open all over town
Strictly biz, she don't play around
Cover much ground, got game by the pound
Getting paid is her forte
Each and every day, true player way
I can't get her out of my mind
I think about the girl all the time
East side to the west side
Pushin' phat rides, it's no surprise
She got tricks in the stash
Stacking up the cash
Fast when it comes to the gas
By no means average
She's on when she's got to have it
Baby, you're a perfect ten, I wanna get in
Can I get down, so I can win

I like the way you work it
No diggity, I got to bag it up, bag it up
I like the way you work it
No diggity, I got to bag it up, bag it up
I like the way you work it
No diggity, I got to bag it up, bag it up
I like the way you work it
No diggity, I got to bag it up, bag it up

She's got class and style
Street knowledge by the pound
Baby never act wild, very low key on the profile
Catchin' feelings is a no
Let me tell you how it goes
Curve's the words, spins the verbs
Lovers it curves so freak what you heard
Rollin' with the phatness
You don't even know what the half is
You gotta pay to play
Just for shorty, bang-bang, to look your way
I like the way you work it
Trumped tight all day, every day
You're blowing my mind, maybe in time
Baby, I can get you in my ride

I like the way you work it
No diggity, I got to bag it up, bag it up
I like the way you work it
No diggity, I got to bag it up, bag it up
I like the way you work it
No diggity, I got to bag it up, bag it up
I like the way you work it
No diggity, I got to bag it up, bag it up

Cause that's my peeps and we row G
Flyin' first class from New York City to Blackstreet
What you know about me, not a motherfuckin' thing
Cartier wooded frames sported by my shortie
As for me, icy gleaming pinky diamond ring
We be's the baddest clique up on the scene
Ain't you getting bored with these fake ass broads
I shows and proves, no doubt, I be taking you, so
Please excuse, if I come across rude
That's just me and that's how the playettes got to be
Stay kickin' game with a capital G
Axe the peoples on my block, I'm as real as can be
Word is bond, faking jacks never been my flavor
So, Teddy, pass the word to your nigga Chauncey
I be sitting in car, let's say around 3:30
Queen Pen and Blackstreet, it's no diggity

I like the way you work it
No diggity, I got to bag it up, bag it up
I like the way you work it

[Slim Thug]
Now look who creeping look who crawling still balling in the mix
It's that six six long dick slim nigga sticking your chick
Pulling tricks looking slick at all times when I'm flipping
Bar sipping car dipping grand wood grain gripping
Still tippin' on four fours wrapped in four fours
Pimping four hoes and I'm packing four fours
Blowing on the endo Game Cube Nintendo
Five percent tint so you can't see up in my window
These niggas don't understand cause I'm Boss Hogg on candy
Top down at Maxi's wit a big glock nine handy
Pieced up creased up staying dressed to impress
Big boss belt buckle under my Mitchell and Ness
Oh, Gucci shades up on my braids when I Escalade
When I'm riding Sprewells sliding like a escapade
I got it made the big boss of the north
Ain't shit changed I still represent Swisha House (Ha!)

[Chorus: x2]

[Mike Jones]
Four Fours I'm tippin'
Wood grain I'm gripping
Catch me lane switching with the paint dripping
Turn your neck and your dame missing
Me and Slim we ain't tripping I'm finger flipping and syrup sipping
Like do or die I'm pour pimping Car stop rims keep spinning
I'm flipping drop with invisible tops
Hoes bop when my drop step out
I'm shaking the block with four eighteens'
Candy green with eleven screens
My gasoline always supreme
Got do-do the brown with a pint of lean
It takes grinding to be a king
It takes grinding to be a king
First Round Draft Picks coming
Who is Mike Jones coming
Slab shining with the grill and woman
Slab shining with the grill and woman
I'm Mike Jones (Who) Mike Jones the one and only you can't clone me
Got a lot a haters and a lot of homies some friends and some phony

[Paul Wall]
What it do it's Paul Wall I'm the people's champ
My chain light up like a lamp cause now I'm back with the camp
I'm crawling similar to a ant cause I'm low to the earth
People's feelings get hurt when they figure out what I'm worth
I got eighty fours poking out at the club I'm showing out
I'm a player ain't no doubt hoes want to know what I'm bout
Biggest diamonds off in my mouth princess cuts all in my chain
Wood grain all in my range dripping stains when I switch lanes
Switched the name It's still the same Swisha House or Swisha Blast
Mike Jones he running the game and Magnificent bout his cash
Michael Watts he made me hot hard work took me to the top
G. Dash took me to the lot he wrote a check and bought a drop
I got the internet going nuts
But T. Farris got my back so now I'm holding my nuts
It's Paul Wall baby what you know bout me

In your head, in your head

What doesn't kill you makes you stronger
Stand a little taller
Doesn't mean I'm lonely when I'm alone
What doesn't kill you makes a fighter
Footsteps even lighter
Doesn't mean I'm over 'cause you're gone

I'd catch a grenade for ya
Throw my hand on the blade for ya
Jump in front of a train for ya
You know I'd do anything for ya

But I'm only human
And I bleed when I fall down
I'm only human
And I crash and I break down
Your words in my head, knives in my heart
You fill me up and I fall apart
And I'm only

So wake me up when it's all over
When I'm wiser and I'm older
All this time I was finding myself
I, didn't know I was lost

I'm all up up on my latest chick
She saying it's that greatest dick
I one-two stroke her
We caught up in the moment, aye
T-t-turn up, V12 and I burn up
My chick that fly bitch and your bitch unheard of
4 AM and we still poppin' bottles
Probably have a new chick tomorrow
'Cause there's so many so many girls in here tonight
So many girls in here tonight
I'm just lookin' for the right one
Exotic as they might come
Better leave with two 'cause really I don't like one
So many girls in here tonight

My problems in this pitcher
Got a bucket full of liquor
And I know y'all got that bad bitch
But ya got way too many nigga's
What's your phone numb'?
Tyga got some roll up
Loud pack with your bad ass
'Cause these good girls just ain't no fun
Double cup and I'm slowed up
Smokin' dub with my chauffeur
Sneaka fly, hitta stylin' I'm the reason why you nigga's foamed up
New York and my slow bucks
DC got that old cup
Hold up, these nigga's want no bucks
Straight shot sipper
I ain't mixing my liquor
Bitch I'm not kidding
Y'all some Fisher-Price nigga's
And we some life livers hoping that this life give us
A lot of money, success, and a woman to ride with us

So many so many girls in here tonight
So many girls in here tonight
I'm just lookin' for the right one
Exotic as they might come

Uh
The streets of my city be gritty
Young niggaz pack plenty, and ain't never show no pity
Many die on streets of concrete, blasted from the heat
From under the seat, niggaz just tryin' to make ends meat
Trying to eat, day to day livin' with no religion
Luxury cars, and this money got my full attention
School teachers and the preachers don't know what to teach us
They don't get a second look without them ghetto features
Created so the non pigmentated rated
Pornographic caught they children learn the words and say it
Save the monsters, but don't nobody know the lord
Status depends on the baddest shit you can afford
And look at me I'm in the middle of the confusion
Crime in my blood and I need a transfusion
Take it how you want to take it
I gotta twist and break it
Make it shine to distinguish from the ones who fake it
and if it comes out raw, and uncontrollable
Money's foldable, fuck a hip-hop quoteable
Nobody felt what I was feeling when I wrote this shit
Broke this shit, but that ain't new so I can cope with this
Hope it get better for those who don't get a chance
To advance, and dig the shit I be saying
You know what might make what I say a little clearer
If mothafuckers judge the one they see in the mirror

The whole state of Georgia

Bubba got another one for ya - MOMMA!
Uhh, better BELIEVE we get it done this time baby
The Mathis family, they can't hide that money from us no mo'
It's goin down, uh, yeah

[Chorus: Bubba Sparxxx - repeat 2X]
Jimmy Mathis please come out here
And tell these folks who yo' son is
And momma tell Russ to load the shotgun
And get this loot cause we ain't got none (what?)

[Verse One: Bubba Sparxxx]
Ha, ha...
Any blood shed for a cause it deserves it
It's blood well worth it, we fought to preserve it
You caught him in person, you know Bubba's psyched out
You hate it when they talk, but love it when I shout
Fuck with me I doubt, that you really can
When I get to doin, my hillbilly dance
A step to the left, then two back to the right
Take a shot of the trone and then get back to the mic
Yeah I'm rappin tonight, but soon as the light hit
I'm all about the green man to hell with this white shit
Unless it's that white shit, that speed up your pulserates
Some party saccarhin, so sweet with a dub taste
This what they must face, I'ma be right here
Spittin these flames out, and drinkin Bud Light beer
'til the cows home and the dogs quit barkin
Daddy tell 'em who I am and don't beg no pardons

[Chorus]

[Verse Two: Bubba Sparxxx]
Ahh...
They watch me in the country like the race on Sunday
And I wear the crown for 'em 'til you take it from me
I made some mo-ney, but blew most of
Bought and sold all the shit that you boast of
But I love my life and ain't much I regret
I just hope I remember, half of what I forget
Through the years and the tears, the blood and the sweat
But if you ever believe, it's time to double your bet
Cause I ain't even tapped into half my potential
But I have shown growth though, and that is essential
Grab you a pencil, and jot a few notes down
The questions they asked me, the answers I know now
Bet I ain't no clown, fuck what you thought dawg
I'm in Jimmy Mathis old truck with a sawed off
Pistol-grip pump, let some shit jump
We take it to the water and yo' ship'll get sunk

It's today but I'm still on it like it's yesterday
Throw me the ball, this the game that I was bred to play
And pass the cooler with this stewardess named Desireé
You ain't no concern, I'ma wait and see what Heaven say
I got a brother by the name of Snicky Ricky Wade
He said - Bubba, real careers ain't quicky quickly made
My other brother by the name of Patrick ""Sleepy"" Brown
Said that our +Noize+ is the type that you should keep around
They led me through the forest, took me to the wizard Ray
He told me that tomorrow won't be what it is today
I said, ""Damn, that's just what my brother Tim would say""
I'm back at home, just how long have I been away?

[Bubba Sparxxx]
I'm the type that you might see with Petey Pablo
Chasin fielder's dream with corn and three Diablos
And I'll be blessed to death if I see tomorrow
But I'ma live to get my son a lead that he can follow
I might can't flip a brick but bet that I can move a pound
And if you call yourself the king, well then there's two in town
Regardless where you from, what you do, or who you found
You best to get to practice early for the shoot-around
Cause Bubba don't play, do them thangs you won't say
Be damned if I even pull my {dick} out and don't spray
Daddy told me just to do them thangs he never did
Breakin broads, get money, live your life and treasure it
And that's the least that I can do, for the man who
raised me up and through his faults helped me understand you
And now I'm certified, New South pioneer
Born and raised down here, best believe I'm dyin here

I know people that died in them schools
Now what is the survivor to do?
Got to no trailer, you gotta move
Now it's on to Texas and to (Georgia)
They tell you what they want, show you what they want you to see
But they don't let you know what's really going on
Make it look like a lot of stealing going on
Boy them cops is killers in my home
Nigga shot dead in the middle of the street

Folding for doe mane and we all in the dope game, buying and selling

Make you wanna wake up and get it in real life than see the wood
In your grip, If you slip and don't grab what you see then good
Only place that you gonna be or ever see gonna be the hood

Boy that word ain't no excuse, You know what it mean to me
It means you passing over opportunities repeatedly
Write it on a piece of paper, Only thing I see is P
That paper, paper, paper chaser, better thing for me to be
Nah, my services ain't for free, make that money multiply
Early in the morning I be gone, chase with me, it ain't gonna be no tie
Try to explain and give em game, I don't know why I even try
You do the same if you was I, but you are you so you gonna lie
Make em think that you got cash, tell them ladies you got slabs
Only thing you get is laughs, You can't even bring down half
Of the bill that's on that tab, Only thing wrong with being broke
Is staying broke and making excuses bout it like there ain't no hope

I don't know how many times I gotta tell ya
In the hood, having no condition, I was having something
I remember it like it was yesterday
They was talking down on me and I lost a couple homies
I was getting mine while they used to play
They say I need to slow down but I ain't slowing down for nothing
I don't wanna let the paper get away
So when I'm in the streets grindin, ain't no need to be crying
The best way that you can help me is to pray I won't let you down
Partners that was getting lazy, Females that was acting crazy
Then promoters that tried to play me, Mixtape labels that didn't pay me
My old homies that ain't around me, Dissing rappers that came to find me
Major labels that didn't sign me, left all that nonsense behind me, I got paid

See, rich people ain't going to tell you how to get paid
And broke people act like they the richest people in the world
Always tellin people with money how to get it
Always spendin money that they thought they was gonna get.
Always buying things they can't afford.
Stop making excuses.
If chronic smoke makes him sleepy, he's gonna tell ya he got chronic fatigue
If liquor makes him drowsy, he gonna say he got that grey goose disease
If women keep taking his money, he gonna tell ya he slipped off his sleeve
Whatever your weakness, stop making excuses please
You should not be in couch or in house, you should be in route
If you gotta ask where, then that's the reason you ain't got nothing
You don't know how to listen, go get it",Won't Let You Down,2009

While I'm violating, your a pretender
You caught amnesia, you don't remember
Well I got the memory of an elephant
I would say the nigga name, but he ain't relevant.

I don't give a fuck about chu anymore (anymore)
I don't give a fuck about chu anymore, girl (anymore)

Your sister told me you was crying
And was feeling like you were dying
I told if I said 'I give a fuck'
I'd be lying
Cupid sent a slug through my shirt
Told me if you cross me, my love would reverse
Stupid bitch, damn you
I'm glad your heart is cripple
I can't stand you
I was the man who planned to cuff it up
But you had dicks on the ceiling, you fucked it up
Lying ass hoe
I bounce right up, now I'm flying that's low
Told you I got the memory of an elephant
I would say the nigga name, but he ain't relevant

That's like a bird, oh nigga you ain't heard
I'm in the mixin like a saute when it's gettin stirred
Pull up in the Maserati, got them bitches lookin' at me like I shot somebody
I'm stackin' paper, I need that dropped Ferrari
Got them trying to claim a nigga and we not on Maury

Look in the magazine, the same exact as Jay-Z (Same one)
I'm gettin' money, nigga you straight flea
That bitch be shining thunder up I call it KD

Gucci Mane and Meek Mills, I'm ballin hard, I'm too trill
New ride with new money, so I had to put it on new rims
Hawks game, I'm court side
Red bottles on the wet floor, give them up to the athletes
Smellin' like a pound of dro, Versace shades I'm yoked out

As the city lights up the night
I feel so
Good cause I did it my way
And I know
That I'm just livin' the life of girls and gold
And I feel so good
Cause I did it my way

Nights bright like Vegas
The life of girls and gold is so contagious
I been cold
Took the C,O, double M road
Hangin' out the windows
Reachin for the world as the wind blows
The crescendo of my career loud in your ear, ear
I'm proud to be here, now that we here
This year, you can find me at the cosmopolitan
Holding bottles, never bottled in
Probably with Chicagoans
And there's black girls modellin'

Attitude is tolerant
I'm married to the game like Solomon

We got from the old folk, yearning for the gold coast
My soul spoke things that was necessary
Found forever in ways that are legendary
And through the drama, I stuck to my commentary
Now that everyday man say that comm is every-where

How surprising I'm admiring that mirror
I'm inspiring the finer things in life
And your time is slowly expiring, you're crying me a river
That's ironic, she have a roll in it as well
I like to swim in it like Olympians YSL
And some Timberland's high as hell
The ceiling is an understatement
I burn through it, prove it's a fire drill
Fire hoes, bad bitches fire hoes
Fire hoes then re-hire hoes
Her entire crew is tired of the liars that you runnin' by her
I can see you ho
Plenty priors of a fuck nigga, nigga I suppose
I can fly her, put her in attire of designer clothes
Dayton wires on the Chevy, why are you not tryna roll?
Don't you know they already fuck me, I'm a made man
Maids in the mansion clean them up, out here

Life goes on even if you don't want it to (Uh-huh)

When you lose a loved one or somebody that's close to you
People turning they back meaning the most to you
Then you find out your man is sending them folks to you

Always true to your word and you never lie
Got your hand on them birds you would let em fly

I had love for this music but ain't know how to pursue it,
Was frustrated as a teen I needed money for Buicks,
My shirt was stained from the sewage,
Niggas rockin' the newest,
I dealt with it for the moment but couldn't call it the future,
I'm down a block from the shootin',
It started to sound like recruitin',
Seein' niggas I grew up with sleep to funeral music,
And I was only fifteen,
I parted ways with my schoolin',
My first seven grams of work were like my holy communion and now I'm turnt out,
The block hot, niggas burnt out,
With no heart it's cold cash that we search out,
We got rules we hear shots then we 'sperse out,
Retaliation, get back exactly what the turf bout,
And it's a gang of young niggas I was hurt 'bout
On the real I almost shed tears in the church house
Back when I thought real niggas couldn't die
Learnt I was wrong but still couldn't cry

Somebody tell me why (why)
Why the good die young (why)
Sometimes it makes me cry (cry)

Since everybody real, where the fakers at?
Since everybody trill, where the flakers at?
Trynta break 'em down, where the tables at?
Dufflebag full of cash like, where Vegas at?
Crap tables, life's a gamble, but a nigga won!
Now I'm lookin' round like, what have a nigga done?
My lord my God, I'm used to hustlin' hard
Guess they find it odd how a nigga beat the odds
No Illuminati never been a fan of saints
That's what happens when you room big as central station
Same rubber band my cousin tied her braids with
We ain't cop the same car my auntie played spades with
What you know about five eatin' off a half
That's five mu'fuckas now you do the math
Oxymoron these rap niggas don't lie

You ain't know that it's something about time?
We didn't care about that
Remember the time I said I rapped?
Then the niggas came after

Flew back to the booth, went harder
Now node your heads to the product
Suck a nigga dick like he hotter
Slinky on the booty like your father

Saluting Stunna on the way to the stage and way back
How many niggas you know chill on the block with they fam and
Tell you if you need something handled, go and holla at Nick Cannon
Still spitting like I'm trying to get the deal
Don't fly private all the time, but I fly private with Shaquille

Tired of that old shit, swag is on some Bentley truck
Tired of these zeroes, ain't nobody near, though

Man, I get jobs, a hundred stack
Ya'll miss Jobs, like Wozniak
I make y'all insomniac?
No more sleeping, nigga
What you thinking, nigga?
I got your girl and need that E like we the Weeknd, nigga
People figure, cause I don't like it unless it's brand new
Everything is old news, even all your club clothes
Look like shit I wear when I need something from the Whole Foods
Royalty the newest niggas fucking old dudes

Body's aching all the time
Goodbye everybody I've got to go
Gotta leave you all behind and face the truth

DJ Efechto,"[Verse 1: Propaganda]
Slang came from a land where they suffer from the effects of depravity like gang bangin' and earthquakes.
Most famous no namers split a brain and plant a taste for the King of kings. I know it's a strange concept.
Pedalin' redemption boy what more can I say make me and Lecrae been trying to make Him famous since ninety three.
Fillin' these 58′s with phrases that would deem us unfit to succeed among these heathens.
It's so crucial in the belly of the crucible that you would understand that stage like your morning candle.
It's handin' out cancer that's why fame was never the aim and the back is the front – homie left side up!
That's a concept

Misconception
Those deadly habits have me losin' my cool...
It's what your frame of mind has chosen.
I'll leave your brain stimulated...

[Verse 2: Braille]
So many mis... conceptions- missin' the mark- mis-directed- drivin' reckless and aggressive
Fueled by our false perceptions- our methods need corrections-
Spittin venom in their face and violate the ones we should protect it's an attempt to motivate
Neglect our obligations place the blame on someone else point out the flaws in other people and take the focus off ourselves
Those who have been abused – view leadership as illegitimate so they don't think it's necessary to play by the rules or submit
They see authority as nothin' more than a power-trip – they don't want to be plugged into it
They'd rather see that power stripped – get it? Power strip... It's unfortunate
Disproportionate the door is wide open for false teachers to twist the truth and distort it
No examples left to follow left to our demise actin' foolish but can't see it so we're wise in our own eyes
The life and crucifixion of Christ is a beautiful depiction of service and submission – within a leadership position

[Verse 3: Odd Thomas]
You probably have it all figured out, right? Like your the type that believes that if you act right then that just might make you righteous in God's sight
You've been a really good person, you followed the good book as much as you could, you probably didn't go to church as much as you should, but it's all good
I mean you never really killed anybody, never really steal from anybody, you never lusted much, or did much, touching of any bodies.
You never use the Lord's name in vain, and you respect you neighbor, you try to maintain peace, love your enemies and not hold on to anger
You really believe that you could receive God's favor by your good deeds and right behavior
But you're dead in your transgressions and need a savior
Cause you could never win God's approval with the removal of sinful discretions – your righteous acts of removing God's wrath is in fact the biggest misconception...

[Verse 4: Lecrae]
Since my conception I've been riddled with deception
Televised lies devised to lead a blind insurrection
Against the resurrection - and the greatest misconception the world believes the Christian is foolish without direction.
And they knock it they knock it but what does it profit a prophet to be socially ostracizing no we ain't stoppin' the mocking
But if there is anything I can do to raise the stock in the market for a Biblical worldview then there's no longer an option
Here with the humble beast, ain't no subtleties, ain't no tongue in cheek, this is what I mean, they don't understand anything about the faith I believe, and they want to belittle me
But it's cool though. They just know the pseudo, the fake faith, the false one, the western God that's man made, not the Biblical Awesome
Toss em' – Pick up the Reasons for God by Timothy Keller and read it, there is a God you should believe in and his name is Jesus...",Misconception,2012

Uh
The streets of my city be gritty
Young niggaz pack plenty, and ain't never show no pity
Many die on streets of concrete, blasted from the heat
From under the seat, niggaz just tryin' to make ends meat
Trying to eat, day to day livin' with no religion
Luxury cars, and this money got my full attention
School teachers and the preachers don't know what to teach us
They don't get a second look without them ghetto features
Created so the non pigmentated rated
Pornographic caught they children learn the words and say it
Save the monsters, but don't nobody know the lord
Status depends on the baddest shit you can afford
And look at me I'm in the middle of the confusion
Crime in my blood and I need a transfusion
Take it how you want to take it
I gotta twist and break it
Make it shine to distinguish from the ones who fake it
and if it comes out raw, and uncontrollable
Money's foldable, fuck a hip-hop quoteable
Nobody felt what I was feeling when I wrote this shit
Broke this shit, but that ain't new so I can cope with this
Hope it get better for those who don't get a chance
To advance, and dig the shit I be saying
You know what might make what I say a little clearer
If mothafuckers judge the one they see in the mirror

And make use of it in attaining success in your chosen occupation

First of all, it is the principal through which you may borrow 
And use the education, the experience, the influence 
And perhaps the capital of other people in carrying out your own plans in life
It is the principle through which you can accomplish in one year more 
Than you could accomplish without it in the lifetime 
If you depend entirely upon your own efforts for success

There is no such thing as something for nothing
Everything, including your personal success, has a price that must be paid

Tryin' to holla at you shorty
One focus, one focus only
Tryin' to hit that thang, let's go

We make hits in the studio nightly

We take trips in the winter in jet planes
To climates where it's sunny

We got mami on the dance floor
Grindin' to the beat, tipsy off the bubbly
But at the end of the day, we feelin' to play
I'm tryin' to pin the tail on the donkey

It goes yes, yes yo, fresh to death balla
You can play hard, under pressure I'm stoned
We playin' tight D, I'm in the paint like a G
Some say they gangstas but they ain't like me

Came from an environment, came I was firin'
Then hit the dealers see the range I was buyin'
Don't test drive like a whole whip like you should
Shoving up pies, a whole whip that you should

Then take the proceeds, waist about four G's
Bottles in the club tryin' to get the home and skeez
I'm tryin' to get the dame to breeze
But she putting up a fight like Layla Ali

I told the lady I'll be doin' the turnpike 80 in the fly V
Middle name 40 on the wrist
Last name you can't afford me bitch

Look like Picasso painted on the bottles
We throwin' money, we lookin' like lotto's
I could cover chicks with cheese like nachos

Fly out the cove, land in the heat where
New York to Miami bitch
Bitch, I'm in the life of a hood star, rock star without the guitar
Got em' all rubbin' they bitch bra

Got em' all shakin' their tush like

But I give 'em a taste of the good liquor, a taste of the good bud
Next thing you know she'll be tastin' my good

And I came from the block, was flawless with ex-cons
And we aimin' them glocks, of course, ready to bomb

Now I done seen a custy cop four pies of the same gear
I also seen a nigga cop four rides in the same year
The concrete jungle, no trees to swing from
This weed and gettin' drunk and heaters gettin' dumped

Or hit the highway, nigga, key's up in the trunk
Back up in the city with some skeezers in the trunk
I ain't a player but I do my dirt, dawg
Drop top 'Cedes better move when it murk off

And I'm tucked up with my boys in back, fucka

Yeah, I'm bustin' off the chrome, yeah, I'm 'bout to off your dome
Kill a mother and a father, kids go to foster homes
Yeah, I like to floss the chrome, nigga, leave the boss alone
See my neck and my wrist, I'm rockin' with a cost for homes

Back out on these bitch niggas, get that Ruger to dumpin'
So don't run up on me, nigga, you know I stay with it

That's the bottom to the top, you seen the bottom of the pot

Yak when we drive, like we rollin' fuckin' felony
Trap to survive, get the buck, sellin' keys, it's hard to get by
That's why we puff hella weed

But if this high don't come down
I feel the walls spinnin' like the sky gon' come down
I need air, top of the ride, gon' come down
And I swear I stay fly when I jump out

Long hair, cute face 
Big booty, thin waste 
Breasts so pretty they can't be real 
They is 
That's what she'll say 
She'll play 
With her girlfriend, tag team on the sex, I give away 
Get em on patrol, for real they 
Both gon have a field day 
Never had experience 
Urgies but they curious 
So gorgeous and mysterious
I'm panty pumpin number one, I'm serious 
I'm talkin fast cars, bright lights 
Big city, long nights 
Pretty women on site 
I give it to em all night 

[Chorus:] 
Bright lights 
Rollin through the city on that M6 
Heavy on the radio station 
Playin my, oh 
In a minute she gon be right up on mine 
And look at youu 
She ain't had none in a minute so I'm really finna put it on you 
Just got a text from your man, no he mad, he ain't got a clue 
You know it 
He can't love you like I do 
He can't do it like (I do) 
He can't do it like (I do) 
He can't do it like (I do) 
So go shawty, twirk that, bump it and work that (I do) 

He can't do it like (I do) 
You kno he can't do it like (I do)

[Verse 2:] 
Shawty say she got a man but 
He don't really stand up 
And that stuff that like he supposed to, all he do is handcuff 
So she come see me relax 
Give me love, receive it back 
Sex her, stetch her body out so much, she say I needed that 
I'm talkin primetime pornstar 
Goin hard goin in 
Ride me like a foreign car 
Invite a friend to join in 
I'm talkin fast cars, bright lights 
Big city, long nights 
Pretty women on site 
I give it to em all night 

[Chorus] 

[Verse 3:] 
Catch me in the old school, new school 
Vert drop, hard top 
See me and at least 2 freaks pulled over in the parkin lot 
Engaged in conversation yo and listenin to the radio 
Give it to em ruff, they say but treat em like a lady tho 
She never kissed a girl before 
But fantasized bout girls before 
Imagine havin sex with women, jus don't want the world to kno

DJ Encore,"Nobody's born evil
We all possess something good
I think we have intentions
To live the way we should

But I fade inside when you look at me
And you say you think I am naive
Just because I have faith and empathy

Changes from all I know
Changes from all I knew
You're changing and I recognize
No longer where I am in you

You think I have no dignity
When I am down on my knees
Compassion deserting me
You don't care for how I feel

But I fade inside when you look at me
And you say you think I am naive
Just because I have faith and empathy

You're changing and I recognize

So you could look inside of me
And see my deepest fascination
It's driving me mad

Falling for me
As I'm falling for you
We could run away
And vanish into the blue

And you'll be falling for me
As I'm falling for you
We could run away and
Escape without a clue

You could be falling
You could be falling
You could be falling for me

I wish you only trust your senses
And let me love you for all time
Just let go of your defenses

Even of the ones in the corners
Of your mind

You took me
Underneath your wings
And I won't be the same

It's just who you are
You're only human
But you are the best
I've seen so far

It's so amazing
What I'm getting to know
And the pace you're setting
Is the right way to go

With an open heart
Knowing deep inside
You left a trail of love behind
Can I follow in your footsteps?

Like a golden star
That's the way you shine
You paved a road that's so divine
Can I follow in your footsteps?

Life is so strange
Never knowing
What the future brings
Living day by day

And I never thought
I would be here standing
Where you are
And I thank you a lot

It's so amazing
What I'm getting to know
And the pace you're setting
Is the right way to go

Into the dark
And empty night where we used to lay
So while you sleep
I'm whispering goodnight.

'Cause nothing's the same forever
I wish I could change with you

Go on (and) leave me
While you still can go on
Without me
You must understand

So goodnight my love
Now you're on your own.

I'll always be here

But when today is yesterday
We'll know

In our lives we have walked some strange and lonely treks
Slightly worn but dignified and not too old for sex
We're still strivin' for the sky, no taste for humble pie
Thanks for all your generous love and thanks for all the fun
Neither you nor I'm to blame when all is said and done

It's so strange when you're down and lyin' on the floor
How you rise, shake your head, get up and ask for more

So if you scared of conflict don't come outside
Get your hands on a gun
Cause ain't no one gonna repspect you as a man if you run, dial 9-1-1
I'm hear talkin' to the street now
That's only gonna lead to bulletwounds and beatdown's, retreat clown
You still strugglin down to your last rock
G-Unit is gorillas and Blackchild's the mascot
You thought you wouldn't hear my voice
I'm in the hood cause I'm hood
You in the hood cause you ain't got no choice
Your top seller gettin' sticked for his shine
Either I'm blind, or Ashanti's sideburns is thicker than mine
I'm youngest in charge with my dick in a dime
Grippin' the nine, sippin' that lime
Becardi in a party, you sorry
I'm blowin' wet green right out the safari
That'll put you in a left lean higher than a marley
And as far as Charlie, a studio hour is a waste
She look like she took a bag of flour in the face
You want street credibility instead of I'ma sting you
C'mon Ja you put a fuckin crackhead on your single

On them Shelltops that got Jam Master Jay, on 'em

She's buys anything I desire, prolly cause I'm on fire

My neighborhood breed ballers that slam dunk
Cross overed to crack now they can't even jump
I leave with any panties I want, the industries new face
I'm in a bitch mouth every morning like toothpaste
Place your bet, Envy pull out a few crates
I got enough 16's to battle 2 states
I'm in a spaceship, neck full of grey shit
Bigetes in the braclet, expect nothing basic
Respect and embrace it, your sketch in the basement
I'll have them try to find where the rest of your face is

Dogg, I stay around trees like Christmas gifts
Yea, you laughing and dancing 'til they stick you
And have you holdin' your chest like I'm singing the National Anthem
Have your worried bout the reprecussions after the tantrum
I'll be alone in a mansion, and it's snowing in the Hamptons
Regardless of what these fools say, I'ma be around longer than 'Cool J
Armed with a new K
So dumb in a new way, If I don't fuck Monday, I'm gone hit it Tuesday
My charm get it usually
You put a lot of years into rap, these lil' starvin' chumps
Start your career from the back of a milk carton
Your gased up from whatever he must of told ya
But everything in Army fatigues ain't a soldier
In my upbring we wore the same socks
And buckets in the living room to catch the rain drops

Full of sweat, bloodshot eyes, and large pupils, X-men

And only those who feel me

We got the murder man that's the spot to chill
Got bitches pop the pill feelin hot for real

And party saggin like two loose socks
Invest the money in stocks

Wanna do it in the high heels
On top of a high hill
Cause my nigga ain't tryin to run up then I will
Hit it from behind that's how I polly wit mines
Man we up all night fuckin by the Hollywood sign
Yea got smacked up
Everytime she backed up
Didn't know there was room in the back
Of the lack truck

Backstage panties down eat dick
Good-bye Biotch

Feel me nigga, fuck with us nigga
Whattup?

If it's a gun I don't mind to pull it
Hit your son with the nine millimeter with the rhino bullets
Know S.P.'ll lose your peeps
Come through in a bullshit hoopty with the Gucci seats
With some Brooklyn bitches that'll boost for weeks
So you know I stay fresh for days
Tote the gun in your mouth, tell you death is just a breath away
You alone like The Castaway

Listen dawg, if you ain't pass a dude then you pass away
They ain't tell you that the Ghost was here?
You ain't seen me comin'?
Told your man that the coast was clear
Now I'm tearin' off both your ears
Kick in the door, load the shotty watch the sofa tear
Y'all scarface niggaz, Sosa here
So the army and the coke are here, we loc' out here

They ain't tell you that I Ryde or Die?
Thirty niggaz on your block, only five alive
Shit, they ain't tell you that I'm harder than Brillo
I'ma give your mother the wire, your father the pillow
I don't play too much, I weigh too much
And when it comes to the drugs, I weigh too much
And I don't say too much, I spray too much
Step over the dead body then I blaze the dutch, what? My niggaz

You know what?
I'm takin' over the game 'cause niggaz is lame and everybody's so butt
You know why?
'Cause I feel I could, I Ryde or Die and everyday I'm so high
You know where?
Right in they crib in front of they kids, I feel I gotta go there
You know when?
I ain't tellin' you niggaz so load up your guns or join up in Gold's Gym

I buy back haze just to get me weeded
One cornball nigga just to get me heated
Listen nigga I am not playin'
He gon' know, the .3 gon' blow and he gon' see the shots sprayin'
Wrong end of the barrel
Too bad but I'ma ring your bell like a Christmas carol
If I run out of bullets
The ghost is a sag and I don't ever miss with arrows

Got a old, old soul, I miss the pharaohs
I am too deep for you, street for you
Wanna fuck with S.P. I'll bring the heat to you
Five niggaz holdin' Tec's on a creek for you
Make the whole family weep for you
Too bad that, they was too sad but you was a scumbag
What? And that's why you fuckin' with dickheads
If they drive through the block I'm turnin' the whip red

Y'all better keep shiftin' ahead
'Fore I take your nose off, put your lips in the head
And all the fiends call me the pusher
But if you see my knife work then you call me the butcher
And it ain't no meat I cut
I'm S.P. listen dawg, I run every street I touch
And you oughta come fuck with the ghost
I got butter open your mouth, see if you could fuck with the toast

You know what?
I'm takin' over the game 'cause niggaz is lame and everybody's so butt
You know why?

Yeah, (Desert Storm), uh, yeah, uh

[Fabolous]
Why wouldn't I talk as greasy as cheese steak meat
In a strawberry Range, pie crust piping on the cheesecake seats
I'm known for hittin' women's soft spots 
With Princess cut Canaries the size of lemon cough drops

[Paul Cain]
I'm right behind 'em in the Porsche drop
Linen soft top, sick chain with 20 point rocks
Take your bitch, why wouldn't I?
The whip got chrome shoes, cream leather seats with old wooden sides

[Fabolous]
Uh, yeah, what's really poppin', usually boys know
This ghetto superstar with the Bruce Lee-roy glow
Niggas has to hate the outcome (yeah)
Plus I'm in a throwback from the same year they assassinated Malcolm

Make so much ends, I got to find faster ways to count 'em (yeah)
A minute on the block, how fast I make a thousand? (Cain)

Why wouldn't these jewels make you want to glance?

And why wouldn't this thing be on my side?)
Why wouldn't this game have you on your knees?
Why wouldn't these 20's be on the V's?
(Why wouldn't this money make you want to hate?)
Why wouldn't I what?

[Paul Cain]
Why wouldn't I pull up to the spot, yellow is all (ok)
Dressed in yellow linen, covered in Canaries never a flaw (uh huh)
Why shouldn't I wear this much ice
The Princesses in my hair, are clear and cut, right?
Why wouldn't I talk this slick (why not?)
With a watch and bracelet this flooded, and a cross this sick?
So why wouldn't I get it homes (I mean)
To a nigga gettin' money like myself, a little brain that's minimal (yeah)
Might talk but I live it though, sick chain glitter roll
Never sleep and don't stop gettin' that

[Fabolous]
Uh, hold up Cain, uh, why wouldn't I have samples of raw (uh huh)
And academic sample the laws (uh huh)
Hypnotic samples the poor (woo)
The European sample is all (yeah)
Will on the right side do with the wings stamped on the door
It's the street family boss, I land by the shores
Get pampered by whores, eat scampy and claws
The kid's been trampeled before by a tramp with no flaws 
That's up to they get cramps in they jaws
I keep kefs jammed in the four
Amp meter draw, end up in a wheelchair rammed by your dog

Come through Aves, like ""Pluto Nash"" in Coupes that look like spaceships
Ridiculous bracelet and the outrageous

Cause you would think we paid a fortune for the shit that we floss
Spend summers in my Sicily loft 
Whole crib, interior decoration done by Christian Dior

[Chorus sung in the style of Gina Thompson's ""The Things That You Do"": Nina Sky]
The things you do, keeps me, in love with you

[Verse 1: Red Cafe (Nina Sky) {Red Cafe in parenthesis}]
Uh, you remind me of hard liquor
Feel like I overdosed on hard liquor
Now you got a G leanin (Jodeci)
You got a G Feenin woe is me
Is are Dot, the fresh and the flyest (Yeah)
The thighs in that dress could start a riot
{UH OHH!} It's the lovin like that
Like a round-trip flight, I be comin right back (Right back)
Shakedown got me thuggin like that (Like that)
All night, I'm out chasin that trap
It's like every thug's dream
To have a down chick or a thug a** queen
Face in the pillow, a** in the arch
Legs done had a divorce, they split apart (Split apart)
I do it slow, til you scream (Do it faster)
Red Cafe, I'm back the Trackmaster

[Chorus: Nina Sky (Red Cafe)]
The things you do... makes me, keep runnin, to you (Yeah, It's The Co-op, OK OK!)
The things you do, keeps me, in love with you (ok ok

[Verse 2: Red Cafe (Nina Sky) {Red Cafe in parenthesis}]
It might be wrong but it feel so right, yes yes this is life
Love is so hood you could bottle that stuff
If it wasn't Cafe I would gobble it up
Yep! No longer thinkin 'bout them R&B girls
Like, Ciara (Uh Uh) Nivea (Who that?) Teairra (Nah) Olivia (Whatever!)
All them names seem trivia
You look mean in them painted paints, do that dance, do that dance
I ain't no backyard n****
But my workout plan will make your backyard bigger
{I like} To see you in my favorite jeans
{And I like} The way you don't hold your screams
{I like} The way you make your body rock
And you ain't scared to lick the lollipop

[Chorus: Nina Sky]
The things you do... makes me, keep runnin, to you
The things you do, keeps me, in love with you

[Verse 3: Red Cafe]
OK! OK! I know you like the finer things
Designer names like Vera Wang
Necklesses and diamond rings
Bling blaow shirts with the shiney things
You could get all that plus a rover
Put my chain on the arm give you the cold shoulder
And the hood respect it man
I bring the pain that's the Method Man
What's 'gon top that? Who 'gon knock that?
We a tag team girl they can't stop that
The world feelin your fella, on the road to the riches let's get it together

[Verse 4: Nina Sky]
I see you sippin slowly (Slowly) I can tell you want me (You want me)
Like that drink so tasty, there's no need for chasin, no no no

[Chorus: Nina Sky]
The things you do... makes me, keep runnin, to you
The things you do, keeps me, in love with you

Uh
The streets of my city be gritty
Young niggaz pack plenty, and ain't never show no pity
Many die on streets of concrete, blasted from the heat
From under the seat, niggaz just tryin' to make ends meat
Trying to eat, day to day livin' with no religion
Luxury cars, and this money got my full attention
School teachers and the preachers don't know what to teach us
They don't get a second look without them ghetto features
Created so the non pigmentated rated
Pornographic caught they children learn the words and say it
Save the monsters, but don't nobody know the lord
Status depends on the baddest shit you can afford
And look at me I'm in the middle of the confusion
Crime in my blood and I need a transfusion
Take it how you want to take it
I gotta twist and break it
Make it shine to distinguish from the ones who fake it
and if it comes out raw, and uncontrollable
Money's foldable, fuck a hip-hop quoteable
Nobody felt what I was feeling when I wrote this shit
Broke this shit, but that ain't new so I can cope with this
Hope it get better for those who don't get a chance
To advance, and dig the shit I be saying
You know what might make what I say a little clearer
If mothafuckers judge the one they see in the mirror

Hottest in the game, yes I run my city
I'ma blow these stacks, way you call her back
Pull out a bag, you can call her that

Sipping blue dot, smoking Bob Marley

I was there felt the end was near 
Watched my dreams break down on a lonely road 
Your world gave me so much inner peace 
And I know I'm not the only one who feels so afraid 
When they fall in love 
I was searching so blindly 
And you helped me see 
And if it wasn't for love 
I would have never made it out 
If it wasn't for love 
I would have given up by now 
And love set my heart free 
And love rescue my dreams 
And love really saved me
If it wasn't for love

Love, I have been searching for love 
If it wasn't' for your love 
I have been looking for love 
Love, I have been searching for love 
If it wasn't' for your love

That's how I knew somethin' was up, he was puttin' his grand
On top of mine, that's fine, he can do what he want
Took me to meet him, the plug chose the restaurant
The plug trusts me, he comfortable, he invites me to his house tomorrow
I'm in a Dodge, pull up to his garage, pull out some dollars
Give him some bread from a bank envelope

Washing over me
And suddenly I'm melting into you
There's nothing left to prove

Caught up in the touch
Slow and steady rush
Baby, isn't that the way that love's suppose to be
I can feel you breathe, just breathe

Giving yourself away,
You've been working hard all day

I see the ground catch at your feet,
I see the sweet signs of defeat,
Like you're beaten but you feel no pain

And then you turn to me instinctively,
Checking if you're alone,
Like a reflex from my guilty mind

I fall away into the background,
Like a shadow on the wall,
To leave you with your peace of mind

I watch from my window up high,
All alone in this room,
So many people go the same way,
I think it's time that I changed my view

Like a king in his lonely kingdom,
A ruler who had no rules
Ooh, 
Oh I got nothing got left to lose,
I think it?s time that I changed my view

Why did you choose my way?
Why did you come down this lonely street?
Was it to meet me?
Was it to tango? 
Well the roots they sound so sweet

Sweeter than gold,
Sweeter than fame,
Sweeter than honey
Won't power the money

Walking along this lonely street,
Someone I'd like to meet,
Someone I'd like to know,
As a kindred soul

oh so spiritual the sound ran down like waterfalls
Running away never the same
Changing my view of you everyday

ohhh

Chasing this fast money ain't no slowing down
Hol' up let's pour up for up cause it's going down

Break it down, rolling up
My money too long can't fold it up
Poured up I'm drunk as fuck
I take more alcohol than a open cut
Early morning getting to the bread
So I call it breakfast in bed
Real nigga don't believe in ghost
But I'm stil chasing these dead prez
My eyes so low, I'm so lit
I might nod off after one more hit
In a foreign whip with a foreign bitch
I live every night like a porno flick
Bitch don't kill my vibe, ho don't kill my buzz
Bitch I'm so fresh and clean but my cup is full of mud
If she not fucking she gotta go
One monkey won't stop the show
I'm backstage with a flock of hoes
And I'm getting blowed like snotty noes
Hollywood I'm still stuntin', makin' paper all around the country
I'm getting throwed, fucking hoes, getting dome and counting money

Step out the car they takin' pictures
That's paparazzi, that's TMZ
My Mercedes Benz that's AMG
Eyes like I'm chinese, out in Tokyo
Check my passport homie I do global shows
And I stay high ain't coming down
Smoking light green, don't fuck with brown
Rollin' up that loud, your dope ain't making no sound
I roll through the hood in that new Bugatti coupe
Pull up on yo baby momma, she treat my dick like a flute
Juicy J kilin' the game, go ahead and buy you a suit
I spend yo ho signing bonus on just one pair of shoes
Let's get high-igh-igh-igh-igh-igh
Pour up a deuce
Matter fact make that four
Ok, now you got the juice

And this? Givenchy
My shirt covered in all stars
And y’all wasn’t wearing gold watches

And you may have a hit bitch
But this one out the ball park
And oh! Lawnmower, just for the snake boys
Shoot your ass into pieces, man
And deliver it to your front door
Oh! Encore, they want more, they’re fans now
Got your girl ass clapping, hands down
Don’t approach me with your hands out
Sittin’ down I still stand out
Tall nigga with jewelry on
Like Christmas lights on a damn house
It’s me, and I’m cool with it
You don’t know what to do with yourself
When I do it, I’m doing it fresh
Born to do it, so I do it to death
Calm in the steps, welcome my dawgs
We don’t get along, I’m tellin’ ‘em fetch
Hit ‘em like “PA!” Hit ‘em like “PA!”
Shoot up the spot and I’m leavin’ like “Ah!”
Okay, you know I started from scratch
I got to the strip club just to relax
I get a flat tire, I buy a new car
You know what time it is, check the Rolex

If you keep whining, baby, you gon’ lose me
Better choose me, baby, come choose me
So fine that I let the girl use me
But I don’t ever get used up, usually (turn up, turn up)

If you ain’t a boss then I can’t sip lean with ya

4-58, it’s a centrepiece
These ho niggas ain’t seen half a million
Got a pimp cup, I’m in the strip club
And the difference is these hoes ask for me

You a fuck nigga, I don’t fuck with ya
2 Chainz, nigga, my cous-cous
All my cousins sell drugs
My brother sent a pack, I fell in love
And told everyone I know I sell bud

All I rock is designer clothes
All I take is designer drugs
So geeked up couldn’t find the club
Woke up on the beach with a bag of bud (damn)

More money than a label tryna sign a thug

Is y'all motherfuckers ready or what?
I don't think you are
I don't think so!

They got my back against the building
I'm the villian that's creeping around corners
Like shorty you see them niggas creeping around, warn us
We might be coming through, gunning through, running through
So be careful what you do
Or the slugs might come to you
As long as I can remeber, the streets have kept me safe
And ever since that time in December, the heat's been in my waist
I need an extra set of eyes so I keep my dogs with me
Doctor says let them die said his fucking dog bit me
I don't know whats wrong with me
But it seems like since you heard of us
Y'all niggas turning into murderers
Couldn't fuck with a third of us
Still against me
And wanting to see me in the box
Grilling me all crazy when you see me and the L.O.X.
Leave you Red like Foxx
Ain't nothing funny about that
I see you in a coma, ain't coming up out that
You hold on for too long and they ain't pulling the plug for you
I'll run up in the joint myself and bust another slug on you

I bring beef to a closure
Know somethin?
From cats stackin four-somes

I scream out fuck the world then I throw something
Niggas scheming hard but fuck it, it's the god
I leave bullets lodged leave you leaning on your broad
And our punks leave you gagged up in your car
Slumping Kennedy-style with your memory out
What the fuck y'all want?
Daddio with the calico 
Let the gat blow leave you bleeding on your patio
I leave rivals on their backs looking up at the sky blue
Not only do I leave you I hide you

Lay you down for the love

Leave the lights on
Knife through your windpipe
Cause most of your niggas ain't cut right
You thinking it's alright 
But it ain't
I'm paralyzing clowns up and down from the waist
Giving niggas facelifts and taking it
While making you bleed
And if I got a taste of the shit I'm taking more than you need
It's nothing but love between me, you, and these slugs

Who leaving niggas cold in the street?

Treat my rap like Cali weed, I smoke til I sleep
Wake up in the A.M., compose a beat
I bring the fire til you're soaking in your seat

DJ Green Lantern,"Good morning
Haha, wake your mother fucking asses up
Yo what is the what?
Well come on then, you know what time it is
Stop sleeping on my roof bitch!

For whatever it's worth it's worth me having my ass whipped
'Cause I'ma have the last lift that ever gets ass squished
I just can't get past these little peasants
That wanna be rauny bad asses so bad
And they so mad they can't stand it
Cause we can and they can't spit (Hawk)
And they can't handle it like a man
And that's when it just happens
And I snap and it's a wrap, and it's a scrap an then it isn't crap is it?
Hip-Hop isn't a sport anymore when you got to go and resort back into that shit
Maybe I'm old fashioned but my passion
Is to smash anyone rapping without having a slapping
Believe me I'd much rather pick up a pencil than a pistol but I'm pissed now
But it all depends on just how far it get's took on the mic
'Cause I'm telling you right now your not gonna like it
'Cause if I get pushed over the edge then I'm pulling you with me
You poke a stick at a big boy you get bit be	
These words stick to you like crazy glue
When you diss me cause they just bounce off me like bullets do fifty!
I'm the beautiful-est thing and your gonna miss me when I'm gone
Like Kieth Murry when he threw a stool and hit a girl accidentally
I do this for Swifty, Kon and Kuniva, Bizzy & Proof are you with me?

[Chorus]
Come on an everybody come on an
Kick your shoes off mother fuckers come on an
Cause we get it on an till the break of dawn an
Wake your ass up motherfuckers quit yawning
'Cause we ain't leaving till 6 in the morning
So have sing along with the words to the song an
If you don't know the words an you can't sing along an
Fake like you know 'em motherfucking join in
Everybody come on an


Its in the media pitted me of a beef starter
In a party with heat it's hard to keep me without one
Fuck slugs I'm walkin' gloves with a shotgun
Constantly popping slugs they hot son, better not run
The bosses of all bosses a Holocaust to whoever ain't conscious
In a house full of dog shit,
I'ma gothic death project, you stop breathing
You die quicker than mach speed without bleeding
It ain't about what you reading
When you meet me better speak like a season's greetings
Either that or we'll be beefing free when
You niggas need a 'E' just to speak shit!
Your leader is a boutique bitch
Keep the heater where you can reach quick
I snipe you with it and we won't even keep it a secret
Nigga I did it from a mind of a mental patient
When glocks wave you can save that conversation for Satan
You brave?

[Chorus]

Yo yo I heard you niggas don't like us
But so what this beef is like
'What the fuck did he say in his rap Em?'
I can see that he's just a punk
I mean these niggas squeeze on me
Please I'm seeing guts
I don't need no enemies, as my family a couple trucks
Am I empty seeing them white I empty out them white to fight you
In front of every reporter that I don't like
No need for metaphors I get yours across when I write
So emotions enough to say ""fuck you bitch, and I don't like you, WHAT!""
I might as well give this up like heavy sales
And just fuck an leave D12 and this blunt
We can't self destruct
I've never felt it this much
Come on fellas, get up
We got to fight like Bugs last night of his life

I walk with a limp, pistol hanging off-a the hip
I'm awkward and quick enough an sick when sparking a fifth
Your carcass is split even the beef is partially thick
We can't take you serious, you a comedy skit
You probably wish that you could be out shooting them G's
But the only thing you shoot is the breeze
I can't believe you speaking on moving key's
But every time we hear you kick it
The only thing you selling is wolf tickets
I look wicked cause niggas will test your nut sack
So when they bust you better bust back
And get your guts clapped outa your stomach
And when they want it (yeah)
I bring a hundred niggas from runave
So get your gun and if you coming

DJ Green Lantern,"Hit him up two times
Three'd be hat trick
Gave him more shots than the pediatrics
Came to his house and shot his left hand out
Left him with more scars than Mr. Def Jam South
To reach the sky, how far would a star go
To handle more cigars than a Cuban cargo
Makin money from everything I spoke in this
Wrapped by more ice than a broken wrist
Got ability to make missy a little tipsy
I'm more P.I.M.P than Mississippi (git it? Uh!)

I know you like to show off you're bust in gowns
'cause you go around jugglin guys nuts around
And we don't gotta wait till you're ass confesses
'cause you go around showing off you're ass in dresses
You watchin porn sittin there at you're macintosh
With you're hand in you're ass like you're jackin off
And you try goin harder than star wars Anakin
'cause you practice at you're house with a anus manikin

got a belt full of steel you can call me santa
You better keep your eyes peeled like a fuckin banana
And don't try to shoot me like some dumb retards
'cause I miss bullets like I'm sendin them e-cards 
Always equipped with the vest so don't aim for the bell-ay
'cause I dodge bullets like I play for LA
And I'm invisible 'cause you can't even see me son
But you're soft as shit I could shoot you with a bb gun
They call me stretch where I'm from 'cause I'm extended out
Find your ass in my house and I'll send it out
I got a custom made gun so the cops link my shot
So far.. how many mother fuckers do you think I got?

Cops come, they don't snitch
No witnesses at the crime scene
Just your body leaking at Yao Ming
When the lights go off pimp, the sharks come out
Thangs bang out, bust till ya brains hang out
Come to your house, sitting on your porch where ya live
Waiting till ya come back to the crib
I'm trying to tell ya how

By twenty-two I had that brand new Ack Coupe
I guess you can say that my legend just begun
I'm young enough to know the right car to buy 
Yet grown enough not to put rims on it
I got that six-deuce with curtains so you can't see me 
And I didn't even have to put tints on it
I don't got the bright watch, I got the right watch
I don't buy out the bar, I bought the night spot
I got the right stock
I got stockbrokers that's movin' it like white tops

Call diapers, I might just be gettin' nicer

I use to carry knots like that (like that)

The king will come, I'm ready
I'm ready

Now everywhere I go, they like Hovi back
Up out the corner office of cul-de-sac
Where's Iceberg Slim? He was the coldest cat
Get your swag back, daddy; where your focus at?
Got to admit a lil' bit, I was sick of rap
But despite that the boy is back
And I'm so evolved, I'm so involved
I'm showin' growth, I'm so in charge
I'm CEO and, yeah, goin' God
I'm so indebted I should of been debted
Sellin' blow in the park, this is knowin' my heart
Now I'm so enlightened I might glow in the dark

These niggas like that you love it, you be it, you're of it
You breathe it, we need it, bring it back for the hustlers
Have you dust off the hammer, dance, can't touch this
C'mon, playboys, bring your cars back out
Cause your boy Hov is back, you know them broads coming out
Got 'em dancin' on the banquet like they from Bankhead
Fuck crystal so they ask what we drinking
I thought dudes were marquess rudoque
So I moved on to dom and crew rose 
And it's much bigger issues in the world I know
But I first had to take care of the world I know
I'm from the bottom, so I still feel I'm from the bottom
Underdog before my cake and still couldn't stop him
Flash Gordon bring my cords and spark the light in the dark
Peter Parker, Spider-Man, all I do is climb the charts

I put the whole world on my back in broad shoulders the ball hover

Since I was 6 17 they gettin' money down south
'Bout it, 'bout it Master P
Ask the nigga Pimp C, ask my homie Bun B
I run the streets, the streets don't run we
Y'all run, we chill, still waters run deep
I repeat, sing along with me
I run the streets, the streets don't run we

Of history in the making during our generation.""

Allow me to re-introduce myself
My name is Hov' (oh) H-to-the-O-V
I used to move snowflakes by the O-Z
I guess even back then you can call me
CEO of the R-O-C, Hov'
Fresh out the frying pan into the fire
I be the, music biz number one supplier
Flier than a piece of paper bearing my name
Got the hottest chick in the game wearing my chain, that's right
Hov' (oh) not D.O.C.
But similar to them letters, ""No One Can Do it Better""
I check cheddar like a food inspector
My homey Strict told me, ""Dude finish your breakfast""
So that's what I'ma do, take you back to the dude
With the Lexus, fast-forward the jewels and the necklace
Let me tell you dudes what I do to protect this
Shoot at you actors like movie directors
This ain't a movie dog (oh shit)

""Now before I finish, let me just say
I did not come here to show out, did not come here to impress you
Because to tell you the truth when I leave here I'm gone!
And I don't care what you think about me, but just remember,
When it hits the fan brother, whether it's next year, ten years,
Twenty years from now, you're gonna be able to say
That these brothers lied to you Jack!""

I done came through the block in everything that's fly
I'm like, Che Guevara with bling on, I'm complex
I never claimed to have wings on
Nigga I get mine, by any means on whenever there's a drought
Get your umbrellas out because, that's when I brainstorm
You can blame Shawn, but I ain't invent the game
I just rolled the dice, trying to get some change
And I do it twice, ain't no sense in me
Lying as if, I am a different man
And I could blame my environment but
There ain't no reason why I be buying expensive chains
Hope you don't think users are the only abusers
Niggas getting high within the game
If you do then, how would you explain?
I'm ten years removed, still the vibe is in my veins
I got a hustler spirit, nigga period
Check out my hat yo, peep the way I wear it
Check out my swag yo, I walk like a ballplayer
No matter where you go, you are what you are player
And you can try to change but that's just the top layer
Man, you was who you was 'fore you got here
Only God can judge me, so I'm gone

They say that we are prone to violence, but it's home sweet home
Where personalities crash and chrome meets chrome
The coke prices up and down like it's Wall Street homes
But this is worse than the Dow Jones your brains are now blown
All over that brown Brougham, one slip you are now gone
Welcome to hell where you are welcome to sell
But when them shells come you better return 'em
All scars we earn 'em, all cars we learn 'em like the back of our hand
We watch for cops hopping out the back of van

That's another difference that's between me and them

And then the Fugees gon' break up, now everyday I wake up
Somebody got somethin' to say
What's all the fuckin' fussin' for? Because I'm grubbin' more
And I pack heat like I'm the oven door

Niggaz pray and pray on my downfall
But everytime I hit the ground I bounce up like round ball
Now I don't wanna have to kill sound bar
Don't wanna have to cock back the four pound bar

Look scrapper I got nephews to look after
I'm not lookin' at you dudes, I'm lookin' past ya
I thought I told you characters I'm not a rapper
Can I live? I told you in ninety-six
That I came to take this shit and I did, handle my biz

I scramble like Randall with his
Cunning-ham but the only thing runnin' is numbers fam

Then Richard Pryor go and burn up, and Ike and Tina Turner break up
Then I wake up to more bullshit
You knew me before records, you never disrespected me
Now that I'm successful you'll pull this shit

Nigga I'll step on your porch, step to your boss
Let's end the speculation, I'm talkin to alla y'all
Males shouldn't be jealous that's a female trait
Whatchu mad cause you push dimes and he sell weight?

Y'all don't know my expenses, I gotta buy a bigger place
Hehehe, and more baggies, why you all aggie?

DJ Green Lantern,"Sweet, and still there's pain
If I would have grew up
To be a doctor
My nephews would have grew up to do the same
But since I grew up through the game
And my influence is the same
And my therapy is music
They ask if you ashamed
And though I wish I could separate
The two things, I can not
So my answer to you remains
I can walk down the hall of mirrors in Versailles
And be so satisfied when I look at myself in the eyes
No shame, no sir
Just big boats and tearing the coast up
Tight coup like I'm wearing the roadster
For any coup it hugging the holster

HOV alright alright
And that may not be what you call perfect but
But its my life
The life
The life the life
Once again its the life

So I make no apologies crooked policies
So a G a nigga gotta be
We playing for property no monopoly
So I'll pass go and let my nephew follow me
They say the child shall lead
So I take it far as I can
We then shall see
Shall we dance with the devil for a beat
I pray to God I ain't got two left feet
Do the hustle put keys in the street
Then I'm ballroom dancing
Ke-ke'ing in the suite
SWEET
Bb's on the feet
Tv's on the seat
Enemies on the creep
Its so corrupt
Soak it up its a lesson
Never fuck up
One day you're up
Next day you're down
Long as you stay the same
It'll come back around

Hov alright alright
And that may not be what you call perfect but
But its my life
The life
The life the life
Once again its the life

I'm even better
I'm eating better
Best thing about it is
My niggas eating together
With each endeavor we reaching levels
Niggas ain't seen in like forever
I'm Hyman Roth I make all my partners rich
I can vouch for you
If you ain't a part of this
So pardon me as I pave my wrist
As I parlay my chips
HOV alright alright
American gangster gangster
Business like I'm white
But I'm not I'm just bright
So fly with no fear of the flight
So if y'all hear my plight
And if you think you can make it this far without fight
Couple mistakes here and there
Not always right
But I'm always real
That's how I sleep to night

It seems like yesterday in September 

We started off as the best of friends 
No intention of falling in love again 
He held me there in my time of need 
My heart was set free 
What a sweet memory 

[Chorus:]
The day I fell in love 
It was so beautiful 
His hands, his tender touch 
I remember the day in September 
When we fell in love 

It was an unexpected night 
The sun was somewhere, but out of sight 
So familiar, yet unexplored and new 
We surrendered to our love in bloom 

[Chorus]

I couldn't believe it was love 
The passion we felt between us 
The warmth of your touch 
'Twas a night to remember 
On the day we fell in love in September

why Is this a life or just a game to lose or win? 

Cause a day will turn into night
And the spirits will rise
There will come then a time to understand...

Could you imagine where life would take you 
Now that you're praying for everyone you hurt so bad? 

Still, don't you go, got to make a choice
Crying in silence, crying with no voice
Dare you to stay now and keep your strength up till the end?... 

Cause a day will turn into night
And the spirits will rise
Hold your breath, keep your eyes wide open 

Now you see: the night is so clear
And you feel: the spirits are here
Running free, running free without fear
You'll find a way to the brightest light... 

And now
Here I am, open arms
Thought your life was over when
There you saw in the sky
A ray of light,
So here I am 

Will the stars keep shining bright
Till one day they may ignite?
When you gaze at the sky above,
I'll ever come down
To ease your solitude...

DJ Haze,"A lot of people are advocated 
That the rich gets richer and the poor gets poorer.
That's only because you don't understand
Whats going to happen to you, 
You see its all just a game ladies and gentlemen,
And the quality of your living depends entirely 
Upon your ability to play the game,
And I play the game",Intro,2008
DJ Haze,"You say you wanna take a ride? Get in
I grew up on that other side, getting it in
You niggas selling a bunch of pies, snatch a Benz
I heard you say it's going down, I'm going in
Go tell 'em it's a homicide (murder)
Go tell 'em it's a homicide (murder, murder)
Go tell 'em it's a homicide (murder, murder)
Go tell 'em it's a homicide, ya ya

Fighting, shooting, killing, riding
Cripping, tripping, spitting fire
In the kitchen, baking pies
Taking mines, making mines
Yellow tape, black gun
Fill it with them hollow shells
And leave the scene bloody
Buddy can't nobody tell
Catch a plane to the ATL
Lay low in a cheap motel
Whatever suits ya
And get a few thangs from my cousin Future
Now I'm back on and popping like
Trapping, rapping in the cut
Talk shit, I fuck you up
They don't recognize who I am or where I'm from
So I hit the strip club banging twenty crip 'cause
Treble with the bass, put that thang up in yo shavening
And leave yo body bleeding on the pavement

You say you wanna take a ride? Get in
I grew up on that other side, getting it in

Go tell 'em it's a homicide (murder, murder)
Go tell 'em it's a homicide, ya ya

[?] open up that fire
You gotta question a nigga standing next to you, cut him off
I grew up on the side you gotta make yourself a boss
Niggas'll shit on you any chance they get
Cross you out on a lick
If you ain't ready for the ending then quit
It's a dirty world, you gotta get your hands dirty
I'm going for the title with my hands on the rifle
I put in the same work you put in, survival
Looking at my rival, they looking suicidal
Keep them bodies off wax, I can spot a rat
Let the [?] play, brrrat!

You say you wanna take a ride? Get in

Go tell 'em it's a homicide (murder, murder)
Go tell 'em it's a homicide, ya ya

Slang a bunch of packs, and go and snatch a Benzo
I played them streets as a young nigga, ain't never liked Nintendo
Them gangstas in the yard, them my motherfucking kinfolk
They'll kidnap you and yo broad (in broad) daylight, no pretendo
I grew up 'round a bunch of monsters, call that pressure on ya
Be so scared for ya life, you call the police on ya
You ready, say you ready
You gon' starve or you want fetti yo life'll change a second
Good or bad, don't open yo mouth, make sure you shut it
Ain't no telling who listening, make a wise decision
I'm from 'cross the tracks, like Boozie
Where you ride, you better know who shooting

All the money in the world couldn't change me
No diamond rings or them fancy cars

Holler this because

Ayo Cali
Walk with me
Yeah that's what got me here
The chucks the khaki suits
All the swap meet years
The six dollar socks the five dollar rocks
Uncle Greg rest in peace he taught me how to chop
That's why I love the hood and everything we got
From the ice cream trucks to the forty ounce tops
All white Air Force Ones to fake Jacob watch
A few reasons why I drive the Bentley hard top
Use it in my songs cause I live it on the block
Tattoo it on my face let the whole world watch
I'm that type of nigga y'all made my city bigger dog
Turn the TV off got tired of watchin' Jigga boss
So we told our mom's we was lookin' for jobs
When we was really in the record store lookin' for Nas
Project of the ghetto, Ghetto and the project
From Compton to being Dre's number one prospect so

Aha!
Yeah ugh
They know
Yeah ugh

Ain't no help there just food stamps
Weight checks and welfare
Every man gone for self there
Still might need to borrow your medicade card for health care
Yeah if you never got knocked then you made it
Everybody know each other if not they related
You can get shot or get bladed
There's dudes that got jobs now that had blocks in the eighties
Six months five years for you just to cop out
Ninth or tenth grade is usually when niggas drop out
Fights break out when you wired and start joking
A lot of OG's retired and started smokin'
House party games of spade sweet kool-aid
Loud music all night till the boys in blue raid
So therefore I could never be too paid
I know where I'm going and where I'm from will get you laid

Haha
Tell me this how come
Black folks get a little doe
And forget where they come from
Man we used to have good times
But since you moved on up you ain't cool with us
We still support you tho we don't see you much
You ain't the first fool its cool with us
But why you living out your idols dreams
Remember how for you came and help you keep those thangs
Now its cool that your address changed
But I'm tryna holla at my dog and the number ain't the same
I guess new homies came with his fame
But see true homies will stay the same
Through all the up's and down's in your career
A couple wives few kids scattered here
And when you dead or broke without a deal
All the groupies cleared
The ghetto will still be here

All the money in the world couldn't change me
No diamond rings or them fancy cars

I'm a tickin' time bomb let it finish the job, 
Lyrical damage on one, two punch, crush you amateurs, 
Box and watch me execute like (cockins?), 
My flow piping hot scorchin', proceed with caution murder any mc, 
Ya soul is lost, when I'm ridin' with them bone thugs, black glocks and chrome slugs, 
Parked on the block with the nose up, get ready for the face off, 
Nicholas Cage ain't got shit on a nigga with a fuckin' grenade, 
One man army, only two things in the world can call me, 
West pussy and that bomb ass chronic,

Never back down, now let the bone thugs back

Stomp on that nigga that got a pistol but he still gon' shoot, 
Cause he a hoe, like half to these niggas is rappin',

We done checked these niggas, met these niggas man I don't respect these niggas, 
I'm a real mother fucking T-H-U-G, original hate to be a critic, 
But yo shit I ain't feeling, no, you niggas is elementary, 
I got history, lyrically you cant see me, physically ill bring your misery, seriously, 
You niggas ain't been hearing me, but listen to these other niggas hits, 
You hear my twist they blew my shit, but its all good, cos we keep it all hood, 
And when we see niggas get rolled dog like a hog should, 
Just lemme put the mother fuckin' money on the wood, 
Bitch niggas would be gone if they could, but I'm a shut em down,

Streets, this ain't my only occupation hittin' avenues, chasin' paper always, 
And I know how to get It, and pissy hallways, in the raw way,

And I love it but you know how the game play got me ready to kill,

J'ai laissé passé du temps à espérer
Je n'ai qu'une envie c'est de voir mes proches m'aimer
Je ne veux pas avoir à quémander le respect
Je suis lessivé, excédé
J'veux pas retourner déposer des CV
Avec le temps crois moi poto rien n'est resté
Qui me pleureras quand je serais décédé?
Et en face de ma classe je constate que je m'encrasse
J'paierais de mon sang mes erreurs tôt ou tard
J'aimerais que l’allégresse m'embrasse
Et les gens changent, tout s'efface
On s'retrouve au point de départ
On se sent mal, tout nous lasse, mais j'reste de marbre (Tall)

J'ai cru que j'avais une triste histoire
Mais quand t'es dedans, dur d'y croire
J'avais les menottes et la vie du chtar
Aujourd'hui pas loin de la vie de star
Dans mon histoire des fautes d’orthographes
Effacées par des autographes
J'ai toujours cru que je touchais le fond
Mais je pète la forme et les choses se font
J'étais dans le faux c'est une chose qui est vraie
J'ai le sourire, rien ne m'effraie
Le temps passe, la Terre tourne
J'suis figé, j’attends mon tour
Mon gars Abou, j'suis à bout
Dur d'avancer les deux pieds dans la boue
Notre enfance collège Paul Gauguin
Aujourd'hui faut qu'on amasse des gains (DeBeing)

Avec le temps qui passe, tout s'efface, tout s'efface
Les douleurs, les larmes, les drames, tout s'efface

Seigneur ayez pitié de moi le jour où je partirai
J'ai peur d'avoir niqué ma vie à faire le passionné
Je parle au nom de tout le monde, rien de personnel
A vouloir aller trop vite on finit par saigner
Malheureusement le temps nous appâte
Car il sait que j'suis dans de beaux draps
Le Diable tente de noircir mon âme
Pendant que mes gars apprécient mon art
Donc épargnez vos discours de taré
Si la zik est un trou noir j'avance sans savoir où aller
Des projets de papiers, loin des guerres de quartier
J'suis venu écrire l'histoire si tout s'efface laisse les parler

Avec le temps qui passe, tout s'efface, tout s'efface
Les douleurs, les larmes, les drames, tout s'efface
Avec le temps qui passe, tout s'efface, tout s'efface
Les douleurs, les larmes, les drames, tout s'efface

Le temps passe et moi j'ai l'impression de tourner en rond
Malgré ma constante évolution
Pas une ride sur le visage mais la pression
De navrer mon daron
Comment s'en sortir dans ce bas monde?
Le temps c'est devenu de l'argent
Mais y'a plus le temps de dépenser cet argent
Fuck les plans, agis sur le moment
La mort en Rolex s'impatiente
Je ne suis qu'un homme que Dieu me pardonne
Aveuglé à la vue des sommes
Le temps effacera-t-il tous mes défauts?
Ooh oh ah

Avec le temps qui passe, tout s'efface, tout s'efface

DJ Hi-Tek,"We don't live for Hip-Hop, It lives for us

It's the eternalist, y'all burn to this, blaze da dro'
Soul rebels trap up, we got a long way to go
Before this here blow like a volcano
We get eternal, this is what you waitin' for
You try to front and play the role
When you more like a pimp who pay the ho
With my name up in your mouth like fellatio
I lace the flow on purpose even up the ratio
Of Hip-Hop to that shit they drop on the radio
Underground classics is what they used to say before
Now we break the surface quiet like an alligator nose
They hate it, cuz they know if they don't get it, then they may be slow
We still gonna blow like the horn played by Horatio
The stakes is three feet high and risin' like De La Soul
So I got Wonder Why, my man Dave and Maseo
We all got babies so we embrace the taste of dough
But y'all already know so I ain't gotta say no mo'

(De La) is whatcha need, (Reflection) is whatcha need
We got the masters of the ceremonies
Blessin' emcees (lip professin' emcees)
From LI to Brooklyn to Cinncinnati, Hi-Tek and Kweli got this on lock D
(Let me hear you scream out loud) if you're somebody
Party to party, body to body
When we come into the jam we do it wildstyle

Yo! I'm homegrown for the bain, once I rock the mic plain
It's the extravaganza we glad you came
Made only for them heads, it's infra-red Aim
For such a world figure, we got figures to gain
(don't sleep on a nigga)
I ain't Icabod Crane get that ass cooked hard cuz we raw like Kane
Been known to mic spit, infinite per frame
While these girls throw me plenty like jenny to jane
Ain't some old school G poppin' memory lane, been on it future robotic
Since the day I came
If you don't know Plug Wonder Why is my name
Most recognized leo with my size in mane
Matter a fact track is simple and Plain
Cuz the complexities I freeze is too deep to detain
Reflect, Kwa-Tone Tek eternally in the game (and De La) oh fo' sho'
We be shinin' the same

(De La) is whatcha need, (Reflection) is whatcha need
We got the masters of the ceremonies
Blessin' emcees (lip professin' emcees)
From LI to Brooklyn to Cinncinnati, Hi-Tek and Kweli got this on lock D
(Let me hear you scream out loud) if you're somebody
Party to party, body to body
When we come into the jam we do it wildstyle

Y'all think these challengers is here to make a man fold
Shoot I've been holdin' these joints since I was day old
Came to confirm the fact that I've been on the payroll
Stay cold til one day make it hot and fade old
Continue til I'm dyin, rottin' out gray and old
I told them fool before they pass they have to pay toll
While I've been sittin' at the table eatin' steak whole, side of greens
Baby yams you know it stay soul, pre-natal
But they want to come spit your way so
So was I supposed to go and say no
Right emcees some walking straight, some take the gay stroll
I get my man to clamp they asses like they staples
I'm from LI we take it far as out as naples
And scrape hoes who'll be willing to take clothes off (off)
See once you bet it all against reflects eternal
You lose every rapper on a dept
Y'all need to pay ya dues

(De La) is whatcha need, (Reflection) is whatcha need
We got the masters of the ceremonies
Blessin' emcees (lip professin' emcees)
From LI to Brooklyn to Cinncinnati, Hi-Tek and Kweli got this on lock D

Party to party, body to body
When we come into the jam we do it wildstyle",Soul Rebels,
DJ Hi-Tek,"In this world (this that feeling)
What's happening to love? (It's that feeling you miss)
I'd like to know (it's that love, it's that passion)
(Tone, they don't get shit like this no more)

Welcome to my longitude and latitude
My attitude is shaping my surroundings
Skyscrapers, public housing
The sheep is running from the sun
The wolves is howling at the moon
It's tragic how you in the street
'Cause you ain't got no avenues
When it come to rapping, who's the baddest dude?
(In this world)
You still don't get it
This a recession--what recession?
Dog, we been stressing
Shit been a mess and we been dealing with this depression
Since way back, but you ain't got to say that
That's the greatest lesson
Slave to our possessions
Greed the devil favorite weapon
Fight to the death; only the greatest left
(In this world)
Let's get it

[Chorus]
Lordy, lordy, lordy, lord
I been hustling really, really hard
Get up off my ass, start making some moves
Put two and two together, start paying my dues
I got to get up for it, stand up
In this world

If skills sold, truth be told, I'd probably be, lyrically, Talib Kweli (Jay-Z)

I get respected by the best emcees
(In this world)
The recipe for my success is
One part pain and suffering
Two parts brains and hustling
Sprinkle it over Hi-Tek production
We bubbling like volcanic eruptions
You better buckle in
Push the panic button
Come get your mama to tuck you in
You know we did like no other did it
(In this world)
You gots to get with it

In this world
What's happening to love?
I'd like to know

[Chorus]

I grab the mic until my hands develop the calluses
My style is bit--I only see myself with John Malkovich
My grind miraculous, rhyme for slums to palaces
Facing all my challengers, raising the black-power fist
Here to eliminate the counterfeit
(In this world)
Add it up it--don't amount to shit
I paid my dues, kept the receipt for taxes
Although we stack it, we stay stuck in the bracket
It's like a straitjacket
My rebel tactics got the planet spinning off its axis
The devil laughing when you lazy; man, get off your ass and
Talent don't mean nothing without all the practice
(In this world)

[Chorus]",In This World,
DJ Hi-Tek,"These cats is no match, plus they lack a certain knack for rapping
They never catch the wagon like Re-run and ""What's Happening""
Since back when they had potty issues and snotty tissues we been rockin
Think you poppin next year nobody will miss you
My thoughts is too advanced for the artists on these labels
They come sweeter than sabal and softer than mashed potatoes
I tried to told you the rhymes run over emcees like Land Rovers
Took 'em back in time like Sankofa, Sankofa

We stand over the Atlantic, looking broad like a man's shoulders
The fire is trapped in a belly, ready to pop like canned soda
We outlasting, from middle passage
Touched down in New York
Cincinnatay! Big Ohio status what you thought
Money it's classic these bastards try to treat us like cattle
So life has been a constant battle, battle
Rising above the crabs in the barrel
Way too used to living in death's shadow
We stay on point like the best arrow, arrow
We hit the target accurate
Star shit, back it up
When we hit town, y'all niggas pack it up
That's how we get down, straight smash it up
Like a whip, hydroplaning
Hydro on the brain and maintaining
Game changing into subtle shit, we remain blatant
Yo, got to tell you to your face
You get replaced in this game, by Kweli
Place the face with the name
These cats drink champagne and toast to death and pain
Like slaves on a ship talking about who got the flyest chain

We the reflection of our ancestors
We'd like to thank you for the building blocks you left us
Cause your spirit possessed us
Yo, you blessed us
Thank you very much

We the reflection of our ancestors
We'd like to thank you for the building blocks you left us
Cause your spirit possessed us

Thank you very much
God bless you",Africa Dream,2000
DJ Hi-Tek,"Yeah, you pronounce my name (Kweli), any questions?
I bring many blessings with my man Hi-Tek and he from the Natti (Natti)
We make the sky crack, feel the fly track
Get your hands up like a hijack
Fist in the air for (Kweli), keep 'em there like
Natural mystic or smoke when they spliffs lit
It's a revolutionary (party), they ask me what I'm writin for
I'm writin to show you what we fightin for
Say Taleeb or Talib (Kweli), if it's hard try spellin it phonetically
If not then just let it be like Nina Simone
You probably (ably) don't listen B
Even when we suffer losses I count the victories
Sometimes it's far and between I'm sad to say
It got my brain crowded like sunset on a Saturday
I know my son wept cause his dad's away
Stop cryin be strong for your momma is what I had to say

To my little man named Amani (mani)
Start the party, my crew hot feel these two shots
Like the blast from a double barrel shottie (shottie)
It's got to be, your man Hi-Tek and Kweli
Who make you rock your body (body)
Start the party, my crew hot feel these two shots
Like the blast from a double barrel shottie (shottie)
It's got to be, your man Hi-Tek and Kweli

I remember when it all started
Back in the day when me and moms first parted
Hi-Tek from the beginnin I stayed advanced
A young chameleon, adapt to any circumstance
Peep game nigga never been a lazy nigga
Stayed on my hustle concentrate to get the paper bigger
Stay focused, while other cats stay hopeless
While niggas stay high I stay lower
Stacking my chips to get a foreclosure
This shit ain't over
Going for the gusto, keep getting that provo
It's Hi-Tek (and Kweli) on the track like Flo Jo
Bet you ain't even know I had flow though

Yo, make you rock your body (body)

DJ Hi-Tek,"One, two, three, four
Grimy bitch stomp the bogey outside your front door (yeah)
Puffin on Goodie, eatin tuna and rye
Blow the spot with some old school shit from junior high
One, two, three, four
Jersey's finest in the house, punchlines and metaphors
Make your foul ice grill, thug grimy on the real
Puttin heads to bed like Hennessey and NyQuil

Convertible style, still had the heat knockin
Bumpin shit from way back with my man beatboxin
Shootin the breeze - see I'm nice with these
You'll be suckin it down like fast food high-see's
Type of rap bitch that love underground classics
Gettin more green than that nigga St. Patrick
Makin wack rappers go and merc the set {*dial-up sounds*}
Better off behind a desk tryin to surf the net
Cause I be adamant, kill 'em when my joints get added in
Worse than boric acid in your project cabinet
Dirty Harriet, increase the fanbases
Leavin non-writin cats stuck on the plantations
Mini-skirts with tights, eatin lunch with whites
Leave the party over here like they Israelites
Got Cali Brooks critics, Ta' Kwe'(??) Xzibit
Gonna rock shit down like he can't get no visits

One, two, three, four
Rock the whole world like the Rolling Stone tour
Raw your wack set is faker than a bomb threat
By a nervous terrorist who's so scared that his palms wet
One, two, three, four
The stuff legends are made of, urban folklore
Like Jim Morrison we break on through
Before I care about your take on me, we take on you

Yo, yo, yo
We bring it straight to your face from the start, yo
Rage Against the Machine, break it apart
Might be over your head, but it's straight from the heart
I show my love in the light while why'all hate in the dark
Straight to apocalypse is where I'm takin the art
Givin niggaz battle scars, ALWAYS makin my mark
You fakin the part of gangster, til niggaz break in your spot
You straight bitch whether I say it or not
Shit is hot, spittin flames on the track
Put our town's names on the map
From now until we fadin to black
Where we at? Thug rebels love metal clubs ghetto
When the slugs let go like Frankie Beverly
Forever we stack notes like the treasury, flow heavenly
Get you high on speech laced with obscenity
Niggaz be gassed like Cipher Sounds, and need rescue remedy
Then fall the fuck off like limbs affected with leprosy

One, two, three, four
Why the fuck can't MC's MC no more?
Hardcore til somebody put me under the ground
With a dick in your ear, still couldn't fuck with my sound
One, two, three, four
Takin me straight to the weed spot, then to the liquor sto'
""Gimme Some Mo'"" like Busta Bus', who do you trust?
Swingin through, your favorite neighborhood lush

I'm I-rate, usin your body for live bait
Xzibit rockin them heavy gems you can't take
Dilate, cock back the weight, spread hate
Heavy metal we settle and set shit straight
Hit gates in my younger days, from the policeman
Me and my clan used to dance thicker than quicksand
Supply and demand the hand is quicker than the eye
Find some chickens to fry, while you find it hard to stick to your lie
I see through the tricks, destroy the facade
Your little lungs is too weak to hotbox with God
Rah Digga, First Lady of the Flipmode Squad
Gotta be hard like a young nigga walkin the yard
For the first time, we ain't the niggaz you let shine
Expect mines to blow lines like coke everytime

Stay strong this ain't for the faint hearted
My name's honored cause my style is insane retarded
Remain hottest from St. Marks to St. Thomas
Take game farther than the put-put planes charted
The same artist who smoke rainforest and bang hardest
My brain smartest break a nigga like a lame promise
All city like train bombers
Check out the pictures we painted (yeah)
More colorful than Kelis naked
Your skills is least debated and your album least awaited
Even Big Tigger wouldn't let you in ""Tha Basement""
Face it y'all niggas face down with your legs kicking
They call your momma Roy Jones cause she raise chicken
You're ""Down for the Count"" like Rah Digga I'm straight spittin
Make pigeons say, ""Uh uh, no they didn't!""
Yes we did so god bless the kid yo
I got my own so I never stress his no

When it come down like the pouring rain
Caught the Train of Thought it clanked across the raw terrain
The cold weather break your spirit like a water main
I looked in your eyes and I saw the shame
Y'all don't know that our greatness came before the chains
No you can't imagine a future where this all can change
If one of us ain't free then we all to blame
So we attack each other fighting project wars and thang
It's all the same across the board we fall for game
You wanna see through that shit then you can call my name

Open my eyes and keep the prize within my line of sight (yeah)
Now cats drop out of school to get fiends high on a pipe (word)
Seem like that's the ghetto way of tryin to fight
The system thats based on trying to stop you from shinning your light
We dying in spite of getting rich
That's why I rhyme like a battle emcee
Battling the tragedies and fallacies
That be killing niggas quicker than infant mortality
They acting like whats going on now is distant reality
Behaving so casually that they become a casualty
Plus they don't wanna battle me anyway
They try to walk away but they stumble like Macy Gray
Cats hit the tunnel to rumble and say, ""Hey DJ!""
Make me wonder why they call Sunday the lazy day

DJ Hi-Tek,"These niggas ain't thugs, the real thugs is the government
Don't matter if you independent, democrat or republican
Niggas politickin the street, get into beef
Start blastin, now a new cat is executive chief
With a, passion for heat you get, blast in yo' seat
Die before you crash in yo' Jeep, never passion in your sleep
Like an old man, you ain't a fool you got a whole plan
To conquer territories like Europeans who stole land
The future of your whole fam' hang in the balance
You the king, and your block is the palace
Y'all niggas is the parliament, untouchable, spot unrushable
Keep your weight wet, call in collect to save a buck or two
Get mad, who the fuck are you? What you gonna do?
Exactly what I thought, NOTHIN, in the sport of frontin
You the undisputed champion, I'm in a class you can't be in
My words is flesh like Jesus, the aquarian

It's just a chapter of the night, in the ghetto afterlife
Where you just seen or heard about or gonna have to fight
Where they sacrifice the life and niggas see flashes of light
When you trapped up in the heights but clappers aimin at the wife

Yeah, dudes gettin money is still thuggin
Chicks gettin money is still ghetto
Still livin the whole thuggish stilleto
Your team let the metal burst before you take an L
You raised in hell, let the dust settle first
Then you ask the question, snatchin the life of the innocent
Shit happens huh, a man's respected by his actions
It's the karma of the street, you try to meet the karma
While the karma sleep, yo it's deep, but the karma can't be beat
You don't know your enemy, so you fightin with yourself
Relate to rap niggas cause they writin what you felt
You got top shelf connects you gettin seasoned like a veteran
We suck the venom out the snake bite, without the medicine
We benefit from niggas in tenements, dyin for benjamins
So bad that they know they own coffin measurements
Ghetto eloquence, in the moment of truth, don't be hesistant
Or fall victim to the element, word is bond

Just another chapter of the night, in the ghetto afterlife
Where you just seen or heard about or gonna have to fight
Where they sacrifice the life and niggas see flashes of light
When you trapped up in the heights but clappers aimin at the wife

Niggas get caught up in the struggle
End up in court in trouble, sportin a bubble
Ford azure bubble, importer smuggle, forcin a rumble
Hit the blocks with a portion to double
Flip and get tossed in the huddle
Police with one piece short of the puzzle
It's a hustle, peep the street life, they movin muscle
And the G's'll make your knees buckle
Tussle with heat until your feet stand in a pee puddle
Cheese double but all the speedy niggas bleed puddles
Make the headlines; some try to escape the fed time
Phone taps on direct lines - tec-9's with the red shine
Jake climbin through the bedroom blinds
Tryin to bring you to your deadline, it's slippery when wet signs
Red time, wipe the sweat around your neck time
One shot spill out your red wine, rock shots to deafen your prime
Pieces of hot lead left in your mind
One slug to the left of your spine
Forever late to rest on the shrine",Ghetto Afterlife,2000
DJ Hi-Tek,"What's the meanin of ghetto fabulous
Not ridin the back of the bus
I'm a revolutionary antagonist
Some playas is mad at us for just doin our music out of love
Some underground heads is hatin cause we have fun at clubs
I'm probably on some government list for my rhymin
You a fool if you don't think they already tapped your line
Medicine is big business so my remedies is herbal
It's music is for the people so we Reflection Eternal
Listen, you hear the difference between science and science fiction
We blow it out like if you leave on every appliance in the kitchen
at once, still rolling kind bud in Cuban blunts
On the corner watchin how kids comin to Brooklyn for they fronts
Niggas run past what they need chasing after what they want
Fuckin chumps, you walk down the street and get jumped
Brooklyn cats like to bubble out of town no lookin back
When you a ghetto chef you mastered the art of cookin crack
Some get caught sleepin on the Mother City so when they go
They come back as tales of niggas we used to know
Never looked up to see the stars in all they heavenly glory
Just straight ahead cause the peripheral is buildings with mad stories
Not floors but dramas is played out, shorties get laid out
like respect and fade out like TV sets
into the banks of our memories (let it be) we'll never forget you
Lyin on your deathbed askin for God to bless you

Good mourning, good afternoon, good night
What have you done with your life?
Everybody time comes to be embraced by the light
You only scared to die when you ain't livin right, man
I'm puttin up a hellafied fight

I need you all to be clear on exactly what I'm sayin
With your attention span I understand that I ain't playin
You mistaken if you somehow think it's just me you facin
Starin me down while your enemy is standin adjacent
My heart is racin but I know just what I stand for
We chasin death carelessly like +Jessica+, I +Care Moore+
Who said, ""Just because no one can understand how you speak
don't necessarily mean that what you be sayin is deep""
In case you die in your sleep you ask the Lord for a blessin
Sometimes they sneak up so quiet that the silence is deafenin
You'll never know who the assassin is until it's your time to go
Your life is flashin, askin for forgiveness but you move too slow
Now the people that you love bear the pain that you once harbored
You was livin for yourself so you could never be a martyr
Life is hard, death is harder; you somebody baby father
Someone's lover, son of your mother, somebody brother
Somebody nigga, now your spirit in the air like a whisper
Hearin your name mentioned when we pourin out some liquor
The days go by quicker and the nights don't seem to differ
It's gettin cold, so I shivered and asked my soul to be delivered

Good mourning, good afternoon, good night
What have you done with your life?
Everybody time comes to be embraced by the light
You only scared to die when you ain't livin right, man
I'm puttin up a hellafied fight

Yo, the time come for everybody
It ain't somethin' you can really prepare for

Yo, yo, Mad Duke, rock rock on and
Curtis Mayfield, rock rock on and
Grover Washington, rock rock on and
My Aunt Hazel, rock rock on and

DJ Hi-Tek,"Yo, we're going to have the word love
In many different languages translated all through the track
So, whenever you hear the word love
Know that, it's going to be in a different language
The language of love cannot be translated, yo

Love is blind, you just see bright light
You up in the club feelin' the night life, lookin' for the right type
Blood rushing to your heart making it beat
When she swept you off your feet and made it complete
You know the plan you had to conquer the world
Thinking you Scarface, looking for that perfect girl
And now you found her
Started with romantic, then got to frantic
Then things that's normally small become gigantic
Now y'all sinkin' like the Titanic here come the panic
Bein' with you like a habit without you I can't stand it
It's tragic when you wonder when you lost that magic
Without understanding that you never had it try to grab it
In the bed gettin' a nut off, communication cut off
Getting mad cause you turned or wondering where she shut off
Constantly comparing you to someone in my past
We don't smile anymore, and we argue over cash
Advance to that physical shit
See what happens if you keep talkin'
See what happens if you lay a finger on me motherf
Yo, see what I'm sayin'
It's like one big mind game that everybody playin and
Niggas say bitches is trife, bitches say niggas is
We just don't understand our fundamental differences
I'm still learning though, actually
I just do what come naturally, naturally, naturally

Restes car je t'aime comme tu es (Stay because I love you as you are)
J'ai traverse l'ocean du verbe (I crossed an ocean of words)
Et je t'ai trouve (And I found you)

Women thrive on emotions, men refuse to acknowledge
So when we arguin nobody win
Words get in the way time and again
Sticks and stones break your bones words break your heart
Whether you in touch with that part or not say ""word""
Words are weapons for the revolutionary
Used for evil make the situation very scary
Word up, but love is brave
It flies in the face of fear
Yo, wherever you want to go love'll take you there
Let's go, you know a flower that grow in the ghetto
Know more about survival than the one from fresh meadows
It got love for the sun, that's where I'm comin' from
Spit in this fashion cause I love rockin' over drums
Word (te quiero) I put my love into my music
If you with me then you love how I do it
If my heart you're livin' in your ocean I'm swimmin' in
Never drowning got me floatin' watching you in slow motion
Love potion overdosin' approachin'
The explosion of my senses everyday without your heart
Is like a sentence in jail
Trust I'll always be mentally free
You got the key to let it out I'll show you how it could be
Love {*different language*} it ain't nuttin' but a word
A chicken ain't nuttin' but a bird
Yo, yo, yo

Some of y'all in love with that material but
Love enter my life like a miracle and
It reciprocal that's why I'm feeling you love
We exibit our natural behavior
Like making love under the moon in Jamaica
Get you so hot you call the name of the creata
The morning we hop back into action again
Up on the wall lovin' how the sun blacken your skin
Remember when we explored the beach
Swam in the ocean and saw beneith
How the colors of the coral reef looked like the illest floral peice
That's what your beauty remind me of
It's hard to find a love like ours, taking it high above
Them other duns try to spit game but, I dont sweat it though
Know in my heart that we connected so I let it go
Now if they call you out your name and that's a different thing
Anything but Queen I'll go to war like a King
Your friends sweat you cause you ain't got a band
But they don't understand
Some things is meant to stay between a woman and man
And they ain't privy to it so they try to get into it
Both you and me see through it so the way we flow is fluid
We speak the love language, they speak from pain and anguish
Some don't love theyselves so they perception is tainted
Out they joint like ""Shit, he payin for your rent"" missin' the point
When you rub me into your skin just like an ointment
It's more than pillow talk, it can't be translated
Learn how to speak it, and become emancipated
It's a language

Universal love

DJ Hi-Tek,"Yo, you know what we got to do, man, we need to get a whole cd
Get a collection of all the music and everything we've ever done

Bringing back sweet memories

Life, living in flatbush and going to house parties
Red lights, bumping, life is what you make it, then sorry
In my lifetime, ain't done too many things
Better than watching your first son put his sentences together
Yo, it kinda make me think of way back when
I was the portrait of the artist as a young man
All them teenage dreams of rapping
Writing rhymes on napkins
Was really visualization
Making this shit actually happen
It's like something come through me
That truly just consume me
Speaking through the voices of the spirits speaking to me
I think back in the day, I absorbed everything like a sponge
Took a plunge into my past to share with my son

Bringing back sweet memories

Like thoughts out the back of my mind
Going back in some time
Like when you used to cut and had to go to the back of the line
Look back and you find
Tracks that make you relax and recline
Now cats rap about packing a nine
When they lacking divine
Inspiration
Running out of topics of conversation
Well I drop it in the pocket because rocking's my occupation
I do it remarkably, spark up a leaf
And possibly you could follow me
Tap into your chi
Utilize your memory
To help you see clearly, then get back to me
Actually, nothing's new under the sun
So when life be stressing me
My remedy is 'bringing back sweet memories'
Like the faces that are woven in the fabric of my consciousness
From cities where making 21's a big accomplishment
Like when my people understood their prominence
And my past life visions of the continent
Like the first time I saw krs live, rockin' it
I heard resurrection by common sense
Dominant in my psyche
I chose my direction like spike lee
To speak my life through mics, and I never take it lightly
It might be something you did to bring you down when you were high
But that karma's a bitch, you steady asking god why
Like when my parents first split up
Yo, I was illin'
Seems like some years they was together for the sake of the children
And I love them for that
I don't know if they saw that
So I'mma say it, and convey it when the world play it (3x)

Bringing back sweet memories

Like black is beautiful, names from the seventies
Let me tap into your energy
Fields of dreams become my property
When I reach my destiny like a prophecy
Especially when I 'm 'bringing back sweet memories'
I got deep into my mind, see I got a treasury
That float through my head like a sweet melody
What you telling me
Reflection is a collection of memories
Definitely this is how hiphop was meant to be
Eventually, I knew I'd run into hi-teknology
It was only a matter of time like centuries
Check the recipe or technique to how it sound so sweet
I freak with word power, my man speak with beats
If I could make it in new york, I figured anywhere I'd make it
Came to cincinnati linked with mood, and we did sacred
Hi-tek beats became my favorite
Hustle on the side was the cut
We started to put songs together like 'what!'
Traveled the world, came back to the crib
And hit the motherland
Yeah, this year we put in work and got some other plans
In fact, that's where I'll take the fam
When the reflection joint is done

DJ Hi-Tek,"Persistance, dedication
Consistant, motivation, resistance to stagnation
Of information, distribute it free to the entire population
No hesitation, makin it public
No privitazation from corporations
Today in order to be sane you gotta go crazy so remain
On top of the game, and master your universe like you was he-man
See me and hi tek knock you out de frame
While I'm stimulatin de brain
In de ""train of thought"" that's the name
Of the reflection eternal lp man!
Ain't nuttin new except organic produce that means that's free range
You might see me on mtv, bet, or still up on the d-train
It's just everybody else be seemin strange in they approach
I see these guys and read they eyes
Need to disguise and so I cloak
Into a cloud of smoke, I brown a roach
To keep myself from soundin loc'
Destroy they hopes of hatin
Don't move aboard before they rock the boat
Yo it's not the dope
These snakes will come in peace to slit your throat
Give you compliments, with a promise yet
To get me heated and provoke me
To be rockin shit, shove apocalypse
Down your esophagus so swallow that
Guess what you could be coppin that
N'kiru books for fifteen dollars flat
Cats who spit knowledge on tracks
And get bumped out the back of impalas and cadillacs
All my live cincinatti bearcats holla back
Tomorrow they gonna wanna borrow raps like
""c'mon black, I'll pay you back""
I ain't no lyrical atm even though I'm nice and I'm a mack
Better believe that, leave that crack alone
And you see that there microphone
Ain't no place to work your self-esteem issues
Do that shit when you alone!
Nigga you is grown, why is you still suckin on that pacifier
Quickly call that ass a liar, exposin you's my last desire
Olympic skills so pass the fire
I roll with niggas that match attire
Black aware, that's filled with gas
But rollin on, flat ass tires
Yeah, yo hehehe, yo, yo yo yo

These chicken neck MCs get me vexed
My rhymes be blowin' up chat rooms all over the internet
And causin' collisions on the highway of information
And then I head back to my prior engagement
In the nation of Brooklyn
Land of Trinis, Haitians, Jamaicans and Bejans
It's amazin' how lickin' shots is the proper representation
Soon they gonna need wack MC reservations
Cause I endanger the motherfuckers, they needin' preservation
Carry 'em home on the top of a truck like a trophy
Niggas still sleepin' like I'm Jay Z in the video for Hawaiian Sophie
It's cool I stay low key, keep a low pro
Come out crushin' shit just for fun like Co Flow
Yo yo yo yo yo yo yo here we go
Ridin' on the sound waves out your stereo
In the procession to your burial
Callin' Hi Tek little Leon the professional
I got the special flow listenin' to estero
Puffin' vegetables and now I'm red to go
The illest rhyme animal like Chuck
Burn leech niggas like salt when i lay in the cut
Think you about to blow when you continue to suck
The shit I've been through
Make me run up in your venue like What!
I snatch the mic and ask the crowd what are y'all waitin' for?
They say nothin' but that fat shit
I got you, say no more i laid the law and all them
Crab rappers played the floor I called them out
A couple of them steeped up and I ate 'em raw
Some more wack niggas tried to spray the door but had no aim
Later for them corn balls
On the way out smacked them in they face with a methaphor
For better or for worse you better call the nurse
Before I send a cleaner and he get to your hospital room first

What you wanna do? I'm runnin' through your front line
Your whole plan is catcha tan in my sunshine
One time 'cause it's some kinda wonderful
Don't stand there lookin' stupid, what you wanna do?

I'll take your style and embarras it with
Words beautifully written like Arabic
Got niggas on the run 'cause the fire like chariot
Introduce pen skills to ill deliveries and married it
Put it in your face like big gats and carried it like Harriet
Various crews tried to bury us
But we shut 'em down like Sagiterious with
That wack shit money you can't be serious
You niggas is hilarious actresses
Runnin around the club pissy like ghetto matresses
That's why I smack these kids back to reality
And how it be in actuality
With ready to battle MCs who skip the fuckin' formailties
We spark it in any club or meat market
Sweet artists don't come on the block they become street targets
If you want it I got it, come get it I'm with it
Your career will be shorter than a midget
And the world will know who did it
I smack up these ho ass MCs like a gorilla pimp
You comin' out the box like a gimp, money you still a wimp
My shit blow out filaments and light fixtures
With the right mixture of words used as colors
To paint the right picture
Graphic masterpieces your whole shit is smashed to pieces
Make you look at your man who rhyme and be like, ""you not nasty like he is""
Believe this when you see this, and don't fuck with
Me either, 'cuz you'll be down where my feet is
Curled up in the fetus
Cryin' from the kicks, watch when I flip
People gonna be buyin' my shit like fiends dyin' for a hit, so

When the nightfall come, we in the right war
Cats who spill blood for a cause, not just because
Defy the authority and follow god's law

Clap they hands and stompin the floor not start the applause
Thank you very much, without further ado

Niggaz stopped gettin jig in new york, bloods and crips in new york
The y-2-k celebration wasn't big in new york
Babylon live in new york, should I keep a crib in new york
Or just v.i., to handle my b.i.
When with my a-alikes we see with three eyes

Yo kweli I agree I, was thinkin the same thing myself
Smog in the city ain't no good for your health
Things changed in new york, type strange in new york
Forty-deuce don't look the same in new york
Just politics, tricks and big games in new york
Switched trains a writer can't get fame in new york
Internet and wall street got paid in new york
Poor folks and workin class got slayed in new york
Even still, everyday they make weight in new york
Flashlights lookin for a brighter day in new york
In new york they say it's red hot
Will the temperature ease up?  black I guess not
It's multi-lane traffic, no sign for rest stops
No corner breaks, put on your gloves and just box
No dance school to teach you to wop and bus stop
Better get up in the booth, hop up and just rock
If you think it's like that, it's not so just stop
All mankind time runnin down on one watch, just watch

We best-sellin authors writin great chapters in history
These cats undercover like gay rappers dealin with mystery
My platinum grey matter spray batter that's specifically
Designed to make rappers break faster than eggshells in the mornin
Inhaled the divine in that's laid dormant
Water from the well stay pourin
I answer back when I hear fate callin
Freedom fighter ready to attack at the crack of a new day dawnin
Way more than necessary skills for the application
My flow is great like the lakes and it rocks like applachains
My facts more than make up for what you lack in imagination
You more confused than tiger woods when he made up cabalaysian
I'm sayin!

Break bounds like the jet concorde
Win awards before I leave for my world award tour
When they scream encore, that's when they want more
Flow steadily, whether I'm on or off shore

No lie texturized, emcees who got the masses mesmerized
With empty rhetoric, they better quit

And make killings
Take children through the wilderness, by the hand

C'mon, shine so bright when I walk by
You got ta squint like the motherfucking sun in your eye
What! Say somethin, you stay frontin
It ain't nothing, let off like I'm big game hunting
Me and Tek stay way blunted
Wave running on beaches with white sand
With a slight tan
Smack the mic stand with my right hand

Leave you so far in the dust that you forced to bite it
On fire like property lost to riots
Yo, ain't no stopping us when we all united

Yo, last night I had a dream it had me open like a fiend
And all I remember is me, you, the moon and ocean breeze
My heartbeat increased like I seen approachin D's
I relapsed cause of these words you spoke to me

You said you want to feel me - inside you - conceal me
I belong to you no other woman could steal me
We mentally attached, essential in fact
What you give is so real you know I had to give it back

How I feel don't even matter if I ain't expressin (affection)
My mind was affected you healed me (we destined)
Your beauty so addictive, I can't deny your presence
So pure I gotta add cut to spread you on

You're all I need in this world to succeed
I won't let you go cause I can see you trust me
I'll never leave or deceive you, and if it's understood
Then we can be together cause you treat a nigga good

[Chorus: Jonell]
All I need is you - in my life, to be down with me..
All I need is you - to hold me, and to make me see..
All I need is you - to be there, in my time of need..
All I need is you - I'll be there, when you need me to be..

When I was runnin the street I know you wanted to leave
Especially the time, you found a nine in my jeans
But you persevered, gave work and tears
That's why I'll never desert you or hurt you yeah

I used to keep feelings concealed, now I reveal 'em
I was hustlin to get right, now we chillin
Oh my man starin at ceiling thinkin of children
And any other situation we might deal with

At first, I was hesitatin, makin a commitment
Now I see you different - so many ways
I need a queen like a king did in great Egyptian days
And it seems you've been afraid I might get into things

That might put me away for years, save your fears
Listen ma, let's get one thing clear
I'll never leave you, deceive you, and if it's understood
We can be together cause you treat a nigga good

Yo, I'm not the type to have a next chick call on your phone
Come see you at night and in the morning you alone
I keep it real with you, like my connect you got it good
I need to deal with you, have yet to leave the hood

But I'm still with you everytime you need me I'm there for you
If I didn't care for you why would I be here for you?
You 'pear loyal, got the kid spoiled
On the low I don't think I was prepared for you

You cook good, look good, Boo I adore you
And if you get me mad we won't fight I'll ignore you (yeah right)
Just playin, but yo I'm just sayin
I'm about to go, cause Hi-Tek waitin
Yo son that beat ready?

And guns is rusty
I'm stingy with trust, you only get once to fuck me
The pure white endorser, skills real like a Porsche
For the cash I'm there like a stalker, uhh

You say the same shit
I play the game with skills like Latrell, and write so well
And I gotta go to heaven cause my life is hell
If I quit rap, this cook white gon' sell

You niggaz got fat while I did time in jail
Now it's time to pay, the rhymes you say
Sound a lot like mine, but not quite as ill
As my rhymin skill, I could relate to how Tyson feel

It's a funky sen-sa-tion ain't it?
I'm havin a conversation wit'cho imagination
It was explainin how you was waitin, for somethin amazin
Like when it come out you out the door racin to the store (*zoom*)
It took a lot of perse-verance and patience
We was preparin for our place among the ancients
Yo basically yo' take on me ain't makin me
or breakin me and yo I hate to see a fake MC
I take out all my competition from like A to Z
Cause I get fly more frequently than a travel agency
That's what I'm made to be, hip-hop through my artery
An important part of me the soundtrack to my oddysey
It got me, rockin retardedly
Pardon me for speakin incorrect politically
Anything less would be me speakin hypocritically, and I don't do dat
You lingerie MC's I see through that
I make a point about you and your crew, go ""Tru dat""
Who dat? It's the Reflection
Remember the name, slid in the game before the ""2000 Season"" came
Breakin the chain, usin the pain as our ammunition
to blast Babylonian towers out of position
It's the Reflection and we poppin like your ears on a plane
We make you disappear like tears in the rain
The fears in your brain is clear when I appear on the terrain
and bloody your nose
I got more lines than co-CAINE that's why you sniffin' around
We diggin' for different sounds to keep it hittin'
Straight up the only way we gettin' down with the sound is provacative
It's for the love and cause of that we got a lot to give
It's for the love and cause of that we got a lot to give

We remain, hotter than the blue part of the flame
I got a glock in my brain
that baffle weapons inspections like Saddam Hussein
and rocks with the impact
Gettin beat with socks filled with ten-packs of tokens
Men's backs get broken when I get open
Words more than spoken
Most of dem MC's on the first thing smokin
Leavin town at the same time causin traffic on the interstate
We stay droppin classics cause the key word is innovate
These cats is so plastic that we call 'em laminated
Tried to duplicate the style quickly got frustrated
More desperate than dudes who search people's ashtrays for clips
I burn MC's like Coca-Cola through the paint on your whip
Shit! My rhymes is like a magnifyin glass
When I shine my light through it, I burn up everything in my path
Last Dragon like Lee-roy (sho' nuff) rock for the b-boy
My rhymes are so sharp you catch cuts that key-loid
Destroyed the decoy, most of y'all d-boy, my culture
It's not that I hate, y'all just p-noid cause y'all fake
Embarassed and ashamed and don't know where to put the blame
And never hesitate to call out my name!
I ain't effected by the negative
It's the Reflection and we dealin with the positive

[Verse One]
Free the rhyme or risk a dig into a deep sound abyss
Unit in the stash the beats and never found the shit
Experience like Hendrix, keep my sound enriched
Cats ask about my stitch, to me they soundin bitch
In my sounds the glitch of hatred, for cats who ain't make it
I'ma give it, as far as you can take it
Tried to take the safe way, told you there's a gateway to skinny
Many can find it but few can climb it
I'm open-minded like a pothead
Doin what I gotta do to keep the spot fed
In the climate, of locked dreads, corn-rows, torn souls
Worn hoes, who been molested by they uncle
I bundle, amongst you cold mother-uckers
The world is bitter, like baby mothers
Look how far El Dorados and wine bottles drug us
Least God and the sun love us, it's the Sun God

Everywhere is broken glass
Nephews smokin squares, nieces smokin grass
Try not to say shoot around my daughter she already know to blast
Catchin the future, don't know who threw the past
It's the, year of the snake and the hidden dragon
Niggaz is fake like bitches braggin
Listen to the ocean and the stars, keep my vision in motion
In motion like cars
I'm down to Earth, at times I feel closer to Mars
The world is yours, I'm hopin it's ours
Some say the Gods is crazy, I see God in our babies
Child of the sun, I allowed it to raise me
(.. from a distance) niggaz tried to appraise me
I'm hard to read like graffiti so it don't phase me
My days be spent, behind dream's tent
Through the sun the divine being is sent
It's the Sun God

[Verse Three]
Letters from prison sayin we need a better religion
I'm a rebel that listens from a eighty-seven position
I can't crystallize the mission lies within
Born to die even in death we begin

Throw yo' hands in the air, keep 'em there if you with me

Kicks and snares take 'em from elsewhere, samples is hard to find

I send force through pipelines to like minds

You had any prior doubts to my skills? Time to let go
Hi-Tek, the beats is right beside the soundgarden
Tracks get in the vein like heroin the way heads be noddin
Officially, people love our company like they was misery
I'm known to blast MC's with the cannon of history
Specifically the ones who forgot where they come from
So it's the light that they run from like roaches
Whenever the truth approaches
I attack the track ferocious, never lose my focus
Hold this true hip-hop, closest to my heart, and you know this
Nowadays it's hopeless and my diagnosis
Is to grab the microphone and be the dopest, you can quote this
Niggaz sound like they injected with collagen
You followin these hollow men no honor when 
You bite off more than you could chew or could be swallowin

Back in the day when me and moms first parted

A young chameleon, adapt to any circumstance
Peep game nigga, never been a lazy nigga
Stayed on my hustle, concentrate to get the paper bigger
Stay focused while other cats stay hopeless
While niggas stay high I stay lower

Erase your trace like your cotton mouth and we pepperment altoids

And her brain is easy to pick like faulty locks
She's awfully hot, asshole burning like Tabasco
She used to be thick, it's like where the hell her ass go
Started smoking weed and graduated to the pipe
Thought that she could quit but her calculations wasn't right
Infatuated with the life of dope fiends and crack pushers
Prostituting for old pimps who mack hookers
Putting dope in the cook, searching for her vein
Tracks all over her arms, she never felt the pain
The monkey on her back is now a gorilla
Fiending for a hit knowing one day it's goin' kill her
The clinic didn't help (nope) she just another young black woman
Destroying her pretty image and her health
Got me thinking to myself, damn, how could this happen?
I seen her on the corner, nodding off, sniffin' and scratching

She wakes up, with an urge to get high
Everyday, the same routine, needing the mood of fix to get by
So she reaches for her purse, grab the bag and the needle
Tie a sock her arm and start shooting up the diesel
Had a flesh back, screwing some dude up in his hashback
The night before, body still sore, holding her ass crack
A regular John, she met her through Tom
She passed out with the syringe still stuck in her arm
Dying a slow death, oh, she losing her dear mind
From the troubles of the world, feeling cursed by mankind
Uh, caught up in a desperate rage, was blessed with AIDS
Lost her appetite, hardly slept in days
Now it's too late, praying to Jesus, she fucked around
With the wrong penis, contaminated with diseases
Two months pregnant, carrying around her fetus
But they found her on Broad, in the dumpster, behind the cleaners

Trying to make some quick cash for a hit of that stash
Listen, baby, you growing up much too fast
Uh, this goes out to every project and every ghetto
For those getting high, using drugs on every level
Living your life, day and night, getting stoned
You better leave those drugs alone, feel me?

Had to open doors no time for broads I was scopin' crack
Baggin like a newborn, barely profit beef pop off
We carry Tommy guns and smoke trees and grab pockets
Pilgrimage life, real like with no money and no white

Livin' by the sword, a hundred niggaz daily
Who get on board and kill for some proper live on them acres board

DJ Hi-Tek,"A star was born

It's taken 9 long months
To prepare for the day
When my life started change
Endure these hours of pain
And all that runs through my brain
Is that I'll never
I'll never do this again

It only took one second
And one seed
At the drop of a dime
I'm on this life long journey
Falling in love with a person
I ain't never seen
Never seen

I remember the beat
And the pressure of you feet
Kicking inside
Inside of me
Made me smile
When I heard your beat
Now my heart is yearning
Something like a dream
I brought life to you
You bring life to me
You bring life to me

Now my heart is yearning
Something like a dream
I brought life to you
You bring life to me
You bring life to me

Yea
With a little bit of extras
You go from to start life
I thought before I'd have you I could get my heart right
I figured I could change
Hoping I could be that
100% that
Ready for some real life
I guess I wasn't but I still made a break for it
Yea I was eating for two
I made a stay for it
I'm so emotional
I cried a rainforest
If I could have seen it coming
Yea, I would've ran for it
I thought aborting it would be a better time for it
Until I saw a scan for it
A blessing in disguise
You're the apple of my eye
It was just one second
But you made me realize
In just one second
Things change over night
So I start seeing things in a whole new light
One night of pleasure could bring a lot of pain
Sometimes it's worth it to walk in the rain
Sometimes treasure ain't a whole lot of gain
But you're my treasure
Even though it felt stranger
If I had to
I would do it all again.
Yea, yea, for sure I would do it all again

Now my heart is yearning
Something like a dream
I brought life to you
You bring life to me
You bring life to me

I remember the beat
And the pressure of you feet
Kicking inside
Inside of me
Made me smile
When I heard your beat
Now my heart is yearning
Something like a dream
I brought life to you
You bring life to me
You bring life to me

Now my heart is yearning
Something like a dream
I brought life to you
You bring life to me
You bring life to me

Said it's yearning
A dream

To me
To me",Life to Me,2007

But don’t make me your enemy, your enemy, your enemy

So you wanna play with magic
Boy, you should know whatcha falling for
Baby do you dare to do this
'Cause I’m coming atcha like a dark horse

Are you ready for, ready for
A perfect storm, a perfect storm
'Cause once you’re mine, once you’re mine
There’s no going back

This love will make you levitate

Like a bird without a cage
But down to earth
If you choose to walk away, don’t walk away

It’s in the palm of your hand now baby
It’s a yes or no, no maybe

Up to me, give it up to me

You may fall in love
When you meet her
If you get the chance you better keep her
She's sweet as pie, but if you break her heart
She'll turn cold as a freezer
That fairy tale ending with a knight in shining armor
She can be my Sleeping Beauty
I’m gon’ put her in a coma

Woo! Damn I think I love her
Shawty so bad
I’m sprung and I don’t care
She got me like a roller coaster
Turn the bedroom into a fair
Her love is like a drug
I was tryna hit it and quit it
But lil’ mama so dope
I messed around and got addicted

These words will be written on my stone

And I'll be gone, gone tonight
The ground beneath my feet is open wide
The way that I've been holdin' on too tight
With nothing in between

I drive all night to keep her warm and time
Is frozen (the story of, the story of)

Written on these walls are
The colors that I can't change

I can't lie, girl you're hotter than a campfire
We can stay up all night like vampires
Compliment each other like burgers and french fries
In the last minute I done thought about you 10 times
Fine on the out but she pretty on the inside
And every since she left its like my heart died

Baby I think you can bring out Gucci's other side
She said how you don't you trust me you did a homicide
Then said I got a boyfriend who I can't put aside
Even though the grass so much greener on the other side
And every man like what he can't have
It's funny but I came at
Baby girl so bad, dis me but I ain't mad
Now you wanna tease me
You should wanna squeeze me
Homie ain't the kid, baby he could never be me

How you wanna go and act anti-social
Bet your man don't know you like I know you soldier
Maybe one day babe you gon' get your mind right
And if you looking for me you can find me in the lam

Baby you don't have to treat me all anti (Why)
Why you wanna put me on standby
I can't lie, girl you're hotter than a campfire (Hot)
We can stay up all night like vampires
Compliment each other like burgers and french fries
In the last minute I done thought about you 10 times
Fine on the out but she pretty on the inside (Muah)
And every since she left its like my heart died

Oh Damn
Once upon a time a long time ago
I had a bitch but she felt she had to let me go
Called me out cause she cant buy cheap shit
Yeah you got talent but I'm a bad bitch
Now when I see her shorty whole swag switched
I walk right by her like she don't exist
Her car broke down and it can't get fixed
Her swag broke down and her bag counterfeit
Oh Damn!
Dats not Gucci, baby that's floochy
Remember 2000 you was acting all boozie
9 years later and you're best friend choosie (muah)
I scooped her in my phantom and I took her to the movies (yeah)
Damn

Gucci don't gotta act anti
Told her she can have me when she want
That's when she fantasized that I can't talk to her cause I got that man pride
Ever since I left baby girl told me her heart died (Gucci!)

Baby you don't have to treat me all anti (Why)
Why you wanna put me on standby
I can't lie, girl you're hotter than a campfire (Hot)
We can stay up all night like vampires
Compliment each other like burgers and french fries
In the last minute I done thought about you 10 times
Fine on the out but she pretty on the inside (Muah)
And every since she left its like my heart died
Oh Damn!

Excuse me if I sound a little crazy
But just wanna be good to my baby
Cause he been holding me down
He give me everything I don't need no one around
But you're saying you can give it to me better
Give me hot like it's July and I'm rockin' a sweater
Just for hitting the road
Would you women let go
Say you got 20/20
Her man's 2004
Maybe I'll give you a try
And keep it low
Let you ride
Something like a test drive
See baby I ain't so anti

Baby you don't have to treat me all anti (Why)
Why you wanna put me on standby
I can't lie, girl you're hotter than a campfire (Hot)

Off set things color ice cream

S-O poppin' x-pills so exciting 
My ex chick n ex homeboy uninvited 
Cases of ace of spade bitch getcha wasted 
The waitress I made her reloaded like the matrix 
I lean laid with a bad bitch black n' Asian
On 20 headed to buckhead I'm racing baby
But take that fake jewelery off that shit is fugasey

Semi automatic that I keep up in the attic in shank 
That shape like Tennessee (ugh!)
I cut ya
I cut ya til the white meat 
And my partner pushin' more crack than a bike seat 
I smoke the best I get my dro' from California
Get high n go to sleep you couldn't wake me from a coma
I might wake up if these rappers got beef I smell the aroma

I hopped up out my bed
Got my swag on
Stronger than fillet Mignon
Two Gs blown just for cologne
Money never limited
So Icey with benefits
My driver needs a passport
All my cars are immigrants!
It's so sickening
History you're witnessing
I had a girl she quit me
Now I'm single want to get with me?
Sticky again they stick to me
If you see your chick with GUCCI
Think before you confronting ruley
Ain't my fault your lady choosin'
430 stepped on purp it
08 verty rollin' dirty
Wardrobe clean as this detergent
Got your girlfriend picking purses
Say she lonely
Gucci only one with to meet me in person
When she met me home
My bitch told me that shes over first

So morning it's an argument
Gucci Mane be doggin' it
Beatin' her down
Straight poundin' it
Drillin' on your sheets
Got your blanket at the laundromat
Wait baby girl throw it back
Old man might catch heart attack
Gucci Mane not hardly that
Smack you like I'm mad at that
Swear this sex so passionate
Oral sex she mastered that
Pornographic poses
Like she posing for the internet
Wait I was not finished yet
Never been a minute man
Always been a business man
Gotta catch your feelings man
Got a man?
Oh really now?
Acting like I give a damn!

Used to like her now I don't
Got a real short attention span
Gucci!

Too hot to touch
Truthfully too much for lames
Gucci mane I'm extra game
So extra rubbers I'm a bring
Got your main thang screaming Gucci
Every Tuesday night we cool whip
Wish we could do it more often
But I'm often somewhere flossin'
Lay it down like carpet barbie
Aston martin double park it
Beat it like we got a problem
Pop her till she call me poppa

Should have brought my phantom na, but I'm mad at my driver 
He so fuckin' turnt up, ridin' on auto pilot smokin' kush and smilin', 
He drinkin' while he drivin' 
Gucci please excuse me , huh, all my goons got jewelry on 'em 
All my niggas booked up, paper they get it on there own 
I don't think you know me homie, I suggest you leave me alone 
I got so much jewelry on, that I think I need a clone 
I pull up to the traffic light, icy as a blood light 
Shinin' like a flash light I might damage ya eye sight 
Gucci got that real ice, don't it look real nice 
I don't want your girlfriend homie but my bitch might

Now straight to the channel shop, that's how she shop 
500 for the flip flops cause they ain't Reebok 
I'm the boy from the block with the very large knots 
Gotta spot in the hood no sofa just pot 
I'm hot, so hot stand next, get shocked 
I got Caucasian neighbors that's just how I rock 
If you talkin' to me tell me somethin' that I wanna know 
If she ain't got no money know you gotta have some doe 
Then she ask me for a drank so I bought a bottle 
She was flexin' really hard, now she flexin' harder 
You a bitch, one more bitch, I only fuck with starters 
So if you ain't a dime piece, ain't no need to bother 

[Chorus]

I want the money, I smell like a pocket full of hundreds 
A whole bag full of Kush I been buckin' since a youngin'
I know you need a man right now because you strugglin' 
So if he isn't helpin' then there's no need for discussion 
In Houston Texas I can spend fifty thousand on a Monday 
I got fifty woman with me, fifty more that ain't comin'
My pocket do the conversation make all the decisions 
I only fuck with bad bitches cause I'm very picky 
He cant buy a drink so he don't deserve ya digits 
I'm polar bear laflare, wrist and ear is very frigged 
My charm big as a midget 
I give yo ass the business

DJ Holiday,"*Talking In The Background*

Uh
The streets of my city be gritty
Young niggaz pack plenty, and ain't never show no pity
Many die on streets of concrete, blasted from the heat
From under the seat, niggaz just tryin' to make ends meat
Trying to eat, day to day livin' with no religion
Luxury cars, and this money got my full attention
School teachers and the preachers don't know what to teach us
They don't get a second look without them ghetto features
Created so the non pigmentated rated
Pornographic caught they children learn the words and say it
Save the monsters, but don't nobody know the lord
Status depends on the baddest shit you can afford
And look at me I'm in the middle of the confusion
Crime in my blood and I need a transfusion
Take it how you want to take it
I gotta twist and break it
Make it shine to distinguish from the ones who fake it
and if it comes out raw, and uncontrollable
Money's foldable, fuck a hip-hop quoteable
Nobody felt what I was feeling when I wrote this shit
Broke this shit, but that ain't new so I can cope with this
Hope it get better for those who don't get a chance
To advance, and dig the shit I be saying
You know what might make what I say a little clearer
If mothafuckers judge the one they see in the mirror

INTRO 

What's up  world? 

Goin' give you a little love right here 

My man  DJ Honda blessed us with a joint 

Word up  De La up in here  ha 

We goin' to spread a little love 

To some folks who up in my hair right now 

Ah'ight? Check it out 

Verse One 

It was a big deal moving my big wheel to L.I. 

Had a back yard  tho' shit moved slow 

Caught a cat on the humble  wassup  wassup  kid? 

Ya'll be memorizin' flicks of the wild things we did 

We was brick-ball niggas, six small niggas 

And they knew it, and wasn't no-body runnin' through us 

Steppin' in the backyard parties was a blast 

Fucking up our sneakers on the wet grass 

Remember getting stabbed in ya ass? 

Your Moms sat us all down 

Said we was niggas and clowns but it was just love 

And plus love showed me that she was a diamond 

Findin' out God, took a hit me dead on my heart 

And made the eye water start 

But you was strong, can ya hear me Huggy? 

Keep your mind crystal clear when your thought gets muggy 

We them easy street kids from Mr. Bryant's basement 

Wishin' for the Apollo, tryin' to get dough 

Now my time moves slow, ain't it all full circle? 

A dove cry makes the whole scene turn purple 

Remember that night you had to hide in the freezer? 

For real, see them kids were real, we still ?slear? 

But now we grown niggas, and we handling kids 

We been since day one, and the days ain't over 

Gotta share a back seat, push with the chauffer 

My Pops said he's waiting for your ass in the zone 

So we can fly to the land, and welcome you home 

Rob-O see we good to go, you know the rest... 

Don't stress, love-love baby. Ah'ight? 

Chorus 

If you got time to give, I got time to think 

See, it could all change in one eye blink 

While you in the trouble water I hope ya don't sink 

Don't sink, don't sink, don't sink 

Verse Two 

Check it out 

Some rarely saw the negative cause 

From the depths of one's blurred everything's now 

Cleared by laws 

Mad for mere seconds, in the span of dying 

Trying to tell you don't go, I'm about to blow 

No mo' innocence, it's about the dollars 

And events of fame 

Aren't you? Search your name 

From the group? Search your name 

On the dotted line, back before the rhyme I had reasons 

To punch the kid who tried teasin' during lunch 

It was a matter of pro-mo-ting de-cen-cy 

But the 'de' and the 'cy' fell off, so I sinned 

Again and again, until Jesus came down 

Wait, I'm still sinning! I guess he hasn't reached the ground! 

Thoughts of me, before my voice could 

Even recall, couldn't afford the physical peep 

How then was now, but now is not 

Yo, I'm a minute wiser but it seems, kid 

I got some beef, can't take or shake off the wrong 

Accept my apologies to Bob, pass the horn! 

No need for false alarm 

Word up! 

The Nuyopian charm is for show back again 

It's rememberin' the was that is now gone 

For the access of the now so I can move on 

For the access of the now so I, so I 

Chorus x2 

Outro 

G'night world, g'night world 

De La, yo 

My man DJ Honda is on the beat like this 

Don't sink, don't sink, don't sink, don't sink ya'll

Of the memories of mine 

And about like this, one time, one time",Trouble in the Water,1998

And I'll smack the fuckin' shit out your favorite DJ man
Y'all know what the fuck it is man

(Alright, alright)
We gon' bring justice to the game
(That's how we gon' put it down)
Straight muthafuckas

That's the sound of the man, cockin' that thang, that thang
That's the sound of the man, clappin' that thang, thang
Yo, in my hood we was taught not to say who shot ya
See the flash, you heard the shot, you feel the burnin', I got ya

Say a prayer for me if you care for me 'cause I'm on the edge
I'm finna put a shell in a nigga head
I rock a lot of ice, I dare you to scheme on it
The fifth got a rubber grip and a beam on it

Homie that took the hit on me couldn't shoot this
Say I'm skinny now, but I look big in the coupe-dee
My cuzin' Uzi out in L.A. done tripped and do the sets again
Got shot the fuck up tryin' to rob the wrong Mexicans

I write my lifestyle, y'all niggas is cheaters
Your lines come from feds, felons and don diva
Oh, you the black hand of death
Then why your name ain't preacher

If you a pimp like kid, why them hoes don't treat ya
If you wanna ball like Kirk
Now shorty let me teach ya
This flow's God sent, it's bound to reach ya

Problem child, I'm familiar with problems, I know how to solve 'em
Semi-automatic, luger tray, revolve 'em, shoot 'em up, rob 'em
In the hood we starvin', you don't want problems
Problem child

And why can't you be man enough
To tell me where you're comin' from

They say you can never repay the price for takin' a man's life
I'm in debt with Christ, I done did that twice
I'm nice, y'all niggas can't hang wit fifty
Blaaat, y'all niggas can't bang wit fifty

Say I'm born to rhyme, there's a shell and a nine
Face stone and the cross, there's a bitch I tossed
See the wounds in my skin they from a war of course
You can check CNN for the, 'War Report'

See the drama got me ridin' with a sawed-off shottie
Catch you at the light, I blow ya ass off the Ducati
Man, niggas ain't gon' do me like Sammy did Gotti
I do it myself, I don't need no help

Give me a knife, I'll get rid of your neighborhood bully
Give me a minute, I'll take a fuckin' car with a pully
See the hood is the deepest stole my innocence young
Niggas jumped me 'cause they couldn't beat me one-on-one

Problem child, I'm familiar with problems, I know how to solve 'em
Semi-automatic, luger tray, revolve 'em, shoot 'em up, rob 'em
In the hood we starvin', you don't want problems
Problem child

And why can't you be man enough
To tell me where you're comin' from

I must've broke a mirror at three and had bad luck for seven
Cause pops slid, mommy died before I turned eleven
This cities split 'posed to let black cats cross your path
The footprints in the sand is Satan carryin' your ass

I got, ""God Understand Me"" tattooed in my skin
When I die, come back, I'ma tattoo it again
I'm the young buck that let the gun buck
Roll the window down and say, ""'Sup up, niggas get ready to duck""

My heart is a house homie, fear don't live here
Nigga believe me when I say I don't care
Muslims mix a lot, God studied they lessons
Even when my luck's hard I still count my blessings

See that look in my eye, ya betta keep on steppin'
Spent time on my cell floor, to sharpen my weapon
If you pussy I'ma smell you when you come around here
Them boys in Pelican Bay couldn't live in my tier

Problem child, I'm familiar with problems, I know how to solve 'em
Semi-automatic, luger tray, revolve 'em, shoot 'em up, rob 'em
In the hood we starvin', you don't want problems

DJ Hot Day,"Oh, my, God Becky, look at her butt  
It is so big, she looks like
One of those rap guys' girlfriends
But, ya know, who understands those rap guys? 
They only talk to her, because, 
She looks like a total prostitute, 'kay? 
I mean, her butt, is just so big 
I can't believe it's just so round, it's like out there
I mean gross, look
She's just so, black

I like big butts and I can not lie
You other brothers can't deny
That when a girl walks in with an itty bitty waist
And a round thing in your face
You get sprung, want to pull up tough
'Cause you notice that butt was stuffed
Deep in the jeans she's wearing
I'm hooked and I can't stop staring
Oh baby, I want to get wit'cha 
And take your picture
My homeboys tried to warn me
But with that butt you got makes (me so horny)
Ooh, Rump-o'-smooth-skin
You say you want to get in my Benz?
Well, use me, use me 
'Cause you ain't that average groupie
I've seen her dancin' 
To hell with romancin'
She's sweat, wet, 
Got it goin' like a turbo 'Vette
I'm tired of magazines
Sayin' flat butts are the thing
Take the average black man and ask him that
She gotta pack much back
So, fellas (Yeah) Fellas (Yeah)
Has your girlfriend got the butt? (Hell yeah)
Tell 'em to shake it (Shake it) Shake it (Shake it)
Shake that healthy butt
Baby got back (L.A. fits with the Oakland booty)

Baby got back (L.A. fits with the Oakland booty)

I like 'em round, and big
And when I'm throwin' a gig
I just can't help myself, I'm actin' like an animal
Now here's my scandal
I want to get you home
And ugh, double-up, ugh, ugh
I ain't talkin' bout Playboy
'Cause silicone parts are made for toys
I want 'em real thick and juicy
So find that juicy double
Mix-a-Lot's in trouble
Beggin' for a piece of that bubble
So I'm lookin' at rock videos
Knock-kneed bimbos walkin' like hoes
You can have them bimbos
I'll keep my women like Flo Jo
A word to the thick soul sistas, I want to get with ya
I won't cuss or hit ya
But I gotta be straight when I say I want to fuck
Til the break of dawn
Baby got it goin' on
A lot of simps won't like this song
'Cause them punks like to hit it and quit it
And I'd rather stay and play
'Cause I'm long, and I'm strong
And I'm down to get the friction on
So, ladies (yeah) Ladies (yeah)
If you want to role in my Mercedes (yeah)
Then turn around, stick it out
Even white boys got to shout
Baby got back

Baby got back
Yeah, baby, when it comes to females
Cosmo ain't got nothin' 
To do with my selection 
Thirty six-twenty four- thirty six  
Ha ha, only if she's 5'3

So your girlfriend rolls a Honda, playin' workout tapes by Fonda
But Fonda ain't got a motor in the back of her Honda
My anaconda don't want none 
Unless you've got buns, hon
You can do side bends or sit-ups 
But please don't lose that butt
Some brothers want to play that hard role 
And tell you that the butt ain't gol'
So they toss it and leave it
And I pull up quick to retrieve it
So Cosmo says you're fat
Well I ain't down with that
'Cause your waist is small and your curves are kickin'
And I'm thinkin' bout stickin'
To the beanpole dames in the magazines
You ain't it, Miss Thing
Give me a sista, I can't resist her
Red beans and rice didn't miss her
Some knucklehead tried to dis
'Cause his girls are on my list
He had game but he chose to hit 'em
And I pull up quick to get wit 'em
So ladies, if the butt is round,
And you want a triple X throw down
Dial 1-900-MIXALOT
And kick them nasty thoughts

Listen to the bass pound
From all type of angles
This ain't no star spangled banner
More juice than Tropicana
Rock from New York to Savannah
'Cause it's Macka Framma?
When I go to a show
Some run some come plenty have fun
To watch a nig get dumb
The right way, the hype way, the tight way
You're fucking right that I might say...

[Chorus:]
Fronters get confronted while stunts get stunted
And my homies get blunted while the rats get hunted
So if you want it here it is so put em up or shut em up
Smack'em down and I'll yell pick'em up so get'em up
Word em up, as I fuck it up I tear it up
So listen up and don't move just play the groove
Don't dime when I crime 'cause kid that's
Fessin' up but when I pull out my mag
Just raise em up

[Chorus:]

One to the three to the motherfuckin' two
And you don't know what I'ma do
That's because you're new but
I got the kaya ta make you feel higher
So say what you want you motherfuckin' liar
Don't mean to boast I don't mean to brag but I got the grab bag
Of funky shit you wish you had
But it's the pace that we gotta pick up so stick 'em up
Hands high reach for the sky
But don't try to get fly cause it's easy to die
Just like a blink of an eye when the shots rang
Boom bang rat ta tat tat
Watch your back cause I'm coming black
Kill that yig yag put the money in the bag
Pass the zags with the Billboard Mag
But freeze feel the breeze if ya sneeze than you're shot
Now ya gotta run what'cha got

Bra top, lots of G-strings, havin weed dreams
I'd be Queen if this the 1900's
cause niggaz gon get it, and E'RYBODY want it
I'm totin bags, eyes redder than a photo lab
The spins on your single, won't even top my promo ad
Hard drops quicker than jackers at the car lots
Couldn't get no harder if you went to School of Hard Knocks
The grimy bitch, sometime be punchliney bitch
So don't make me go there! (*starts singing to ""The P is Free""*)
Because the groupies are free, but the rhymes cost money..

Dirty south connect, so show some respect
When my niggaz comin through you see we comin correct
Who are you, what you do, who you tryin to threat?

I'm the wrong cat to call out; we fall out
The police gon' have some dead bodies to haul out
All out in the open for the world to see
Avire-x to the z-I, be-I-t
V.i.p., you're small time, three on three
Cause you can't ball accurately, tackle the beast
Stomp it down, slap it with heat, bitch behave
Shit, we blaze to make a nigga act his age
I'm tryin to write the phrase that pays
You kick it with gays, dykes, and all type of wackness
Preach what you practice
Here we separate the real niggaz from the actors
A&r's, mc searchin, suck my cactus!
Blackness surround your sight and sound
As xzibit hit you and you hit the ground
My chips ain't never gon' be down, watch me smoke
And flatline the first nigga to cross this line

It's the gipp goodie, we kick the soul slang
To yo' block, or they streets, we all gon' hang
We like to shine and ride, bump corners in our bumper cars
Top down, with the candy paint job
Import export up and down the highway
Old ladies transportin straight through the skyways
In the corner in the five(? ) I got purple haze
Fat knot short sess with the tree ton(? )
These streets we run, rapper refund
You ridin up but we want yo' flows old like girbauds
We hold, everything it takes to create the odes
To north to the west to the south again
If it's war that you want just pull the pin
Rules we don't break 'em, we refuse to bend
If you don't build right you better take yo' ass home
Cause some catch stray bullets all alone

Collarless, japanese aikido with, rottweiler mixed
Top dollar dick now, swallow my whole nut rap

You have to listen, brew, trapped in a tragic addiction
Styles, multiply like japanese mathematicians
Cut cause chaos - my kicks kill criminals
I'm the subliminal adolf
I'm the bomb that's attached to the time of a ticker
Figure or swastika
Quicker to pick a form of execution, pull it
Bullet, to the head instead of eletrocution
The rambunctious, bump in yo' trunk shit
Totally insane, hurricane with pharoahe monch, gipp

DJ Hurricane,"Yo believe I paid the dues man I started in the game
With mans on linden and Devan we drinking ghetto champagne
Slinging rocks and packing glock's on the blocks
It's early in the morning I'm selling tumbs from my Reebok

Tres nicks and dimes I write rhymes
But the ghetto times they got the cheeks doing crimes
The street life yeah that's the only life I know
Where niggas sling rocks bust shots and push yeah yo

Sit on crates keep their backs against gates
Every man is insane he's got a brain like Norman bates
Timberland boots ski hats we pack gat's
Carry across town because we tapping Niggers Hoodrats

But they don't want the fam
See a south side Jamaica queen fellas get down man
Listen so what your crew is x-rated
Peoples if you violate you getting violated

[Chorus]
Come on and keep it real; this is saying
that the lost boy and group home fam want it all what would you do
And if you feel that you'se a real soldier from the street
throw your hand in the air we salute you
Bounce it up town bounce it down south
Bounce bounce it up town bounce it down south

I had a messed up childhood the head is mad nappy
I need money in a snap gee kid I'm trying to blow like papi
Fat cat the street life is where it's at
Peeling caps so yo we got to stay strapped

Terrified cause the crew from the south side is bustin
No question
I keep my hear in braids taliq got dreads
Hangin out in the reds wearing levis and pro-keds

Pouring beer on the curb for the dead
I had to bring drama to some powder head
(Freaky TAH) hey yo cut the music down
Yo half the world thought the album failed in this 94 and its on..

I'm smoking weed in 96' with my peeps
Jetting from the police cause police they'se a bunch of creeps
I'm testing off the new burners in the park
We sleep during the day and creep when it's dark

I once had to cry when I seen Tyrone die
This black on black crime I cram to understand why
Baby girls having kids in their teens
Young fellows baggy jeans slinging crack to the crack fiends

That's the type of lifestyle that I lead
With my fams on the corner drinking beers and smoking weed
Yo believe I been through all the struggles and the pain
I'm ripping out my hairs and I can't get to my brain

I want the gold teeth and chains
I hustle with timberland boots and rainsuits when it rains.
Fools make your moves pay dues
Give up your cheese you loose my baby boy need shoes

Stepping to the CHEEKS you made an error
You been to the ?house of pain? now welcome to my yard of terror
What you think I'm some sucka
Word to him I stomp you out with my tim chukkas

Who who you stepping to the lost boy crew
Boy get stomped that ass is through

[Chorus]
See we live the street life
Smoking blunts with the wife stay on point like a ....
Every day on rockaway is getting hotta
I can't do what a want to I do what I gotta

Survive I might not be around in 95
See I was taught young to be strong and just strive
So nowadays we packing guns
We racking grimy hills for funds and I stash all my sons mons

A little man to look after
Taking rap as a joke but I see no laughter
To man Charles Suitte and big tig in Atlanta and Va.....

DJ Hype,"Life, a new state of mind, new state of being
Constantly striving to understand what you're seeing
Finding the courage to stop fleeing
Problems that lie within
So this is where we begin
Self-esteem: something that's diminishing
Look upon the faces of the youth you'll see them withering
Societal pressures can be imprisoning
Look at the effects that they have on us all is rather vividly
How many women you know with eating disorders?
How much makeup on the faces of our pre-pubescent daughters?
Dudes are acting macho and they don't know why
A famous never-written motto is that ""boys should never cry""
Keep all those emotions bottled up, now what's up?
You can't communicate once you became an adult
Situations got brought 'cause you had lockjaw
Your kids ended up learning about life from a pop star
But I feel that rap is more real
Matter of fact this music's gotten me through many an ordeal
I was laying on a stretcher kicking rhymes by Eazy-E
After falling off my bike while holding food from Mickey D's
So I chilled, had to calm my mental state
Happy with the knowledge that the music helped me meditate
And while I'm healing waiting for this world to erupt
You can catch me sitting next to my crate pulling out cuts

And the GZA, Investigative Reports
He, Ghost' and Raekwon, they didn't take no shorts
Plus the are, 'cause that's the way that it has to be
These brothers redefined lyrical mastery
And I could go on cold pulling cuts for days
But I got something to say about you rappers today
Your rhymes drop in weak spurts so you bite 'til your teeth hurt
But I'm your dentist so meet my apprentice
Chucky, and Charlie Bronson from Death Wish
I couldn't hoard all of these medical skills and be selfish
It's hard to say rhymes with no incisors or canines
I kill all the weak minds, administer brain????????
'Cause I'm the type of kid that's on the positive tip
But that's because I suppress my urges to slaughter you quick
But this time I just can't fight the feeling

It's growing in the street right up through the concrete
But soft and sweet and dreaming

With eyes as black as coal that look down in my soul
And starts a fire there and then I lose control

'Cause y'all are the judge, the day of judgment finally is near
In your eye I see a tear, and it's remindin' me of fear
Rap's been dead so long, so stop denyin' what you feel

Dis payback for the fact that y'all ain't tryin' to keep it real
Grim reaper that we call revenge right beside ya in your ear
He's saying your time expired, time is finally due it's clear
Not sober mind is a weak mind and he's buyin' you a beer

To the haters that hate you the most

And the friends that pretend to be your folks

This is what revenge sounds like
(Your heart's beatin', your heart's beatin')
I hear your heart beatin', keep runnin' your mouth, yeah

Your mouth runnin' ahead of you, your mouth do what your legs should do
Let me walk to the edge with you, jump off of it, it
It sounds like your ready to, 'cause these rappers are terrible
And the game is unbearable but I'ma fix, fix

This feeling that's dead in you got your brains like a vegetable
Use the pro tools and tell 'em to edit it, it
Switch to somethin' that's better fool, turn it up what you better do
When I'm bringing revenge to you it sounds like this, this, this

Somebody call the doctor
(You're not breathin', you're not breathin')
They ain't gonna be well after this one right here
You're not breathin'

That's about to be runnin' the game

Tell 'em the name, Chamillitary Mayne

Shoulda heard what I was tellin' you, I don't do what the jealous do
I don't hate when a nigga make it, 'cause I'm smarter and better too
You run when they tell you to but I move when I'm ready to
If you stop to take a breather, see that I'm light years ahead of you

y'all musta thought y'all wasn't gonna have to see me or somethin'

I ain't think so, yeah

The feeling's great 'cause they pay me, I expect some hatred so daily
I'm sticking the middle finger up like the feeling's mutual baby
The franchise and they say that the future can't really trade me
In Houston, I'm number one like I'm in the place of McGrady

But keep on pacing it baby, the full truth has arrived
If they ask you about you nigga, you fin' to lie
They ask me about me and hear a truthful reply
They said they seem none better than me so hear the truth wit'cha eyes

Better go take over befo' it rains
'Cause I'd hate to say that I told you Mayne
I know, I know what you're gonna say
But have it your way

I know these haters is gonna hate
And I see that angry look on your face
Tell 'em sound of revenge is on the way
This isn't your day

Lookin' for the truth, they ask me where have you been?
Where have you been? Where have you been?
Getting ready for these haters, I got somethin' for them
Somethin' for them, somethin' for them

You're real quiet 'til you think you hear a sound in the wind
Sound in the wind, sound in the wind
You turn around 'cause you think you hear that sound once again
You hear that?

That's The Sound of Revenge

Twenty two that, pounds of dro I done blew that
You should of knew that, the Slim Thug gon' shine
My ear rings cost a dime, I read Rolex Times
I'm top of the line, you can tell when I open my mouth
I bet nobody got mo' princess cut teeth, than the Boss
Open your mouth up you lost, I'm blinding these boys
I'm joining rocks in your blocks, in candy blue toys
Talking noise, 'cause I ain't old enough to drank
But I got mo' cash to last, than your daddy in the bank

S-Type Jag straight off the lot, believe me dog I'm really hot
I'm swanging four's and thinking thoed, banging hoes and changing clothes
Smoking dro and doing shows, paper stack can never fold
I bought the car and I bought the house, I represent the Dirty South
Got more syrup than Waffle House, run through hoes like Marshall Faulk
I talk the talk and walk the walk, 'cause nigga I'm a G
Lil Flip is who I be, I know your gal know me
'Cause I wear a Roley, that look like a snowman
And I push a Jag, you just gotta see it man
I'm sitting on Dubs, kinda like a blank tape
You see them rocks in my teeth, ain't none of em fake
Give me a break, you think I'm lying or something
I'm at the mall with your hoe, and she buying me something
I'm a young pimp, with a whole lot of cash
And why'all haters, why'all can kiss our ass

Anything I S-E-E, I be	-you-why
Pull a Bentley off the lot, and ran that thang in the wall
We throw Crys in the air laugh, and watch it fall
Watch me ball, as the Dub spin like a top
I got crunk when I stopped, and made my pop trunk wop
Girls bop, automatic cause I'm top of the line
I cut my beep past six, and I raise the top of your spine
I'ma shine, Sucka Free, Boss Hogg in a row
You can catch me fresh and braided, or rugged and fro
You see the Spre's on the car, I bet you my people like the rock
When girls see Tite, Flip and Slim they say... pulling cameras out
Damn I'm hot, when I hit the club I'm bound to line to the bar
And for the first hundred people, I'm insuring they car
Attracting your star, cause nigga my piece attracting your car

Roll down the tints, G-Unit

When the lead touch ya
And they ain't no coming back when you dead fucker
Sleep in your earn
And get eaten by worms
Trying to fight a fire with
Bottled water heat and get burned
They tampered my phones
Like D-are-E and the firm
'cause I'm buzzing like WuTang
And it ain't even my turn
So who it may concern
You'll get your whole mouth wide
Fuckin with them gang bangers

DJ Ideal,"They said no when I told them that I'd find a way to get to the top
They didn't know that eventually I'd be the one to worry about
When someone would mention me, they always tried to say I would flop
But this the sound of revenge

Yea
On the path to find out who's true
The only person you can really trust is you
And if you feel like you can't even trust you
Then you can always trust you know who
And if you don't know who you know who is
Then I feel so sorry for you
Cause that's really the only person that can judge you
Critics, people that wanna see you fail will tell you what you can't do
Shouldn't do and must do
But when you got that glow
Nobody else's words can really budge you

Revenge has always been looked upon as a sin
And sometimes you feel like you had to sin to win
Sometime it sound like :gunshot: 
Is what it coulda been
When you get to the gates of Heaven they probably wouldn't let ya in
But ya change that meanin' up and success is what it is in the end
And instead of worryin' about what shoulda, coulda, woulda been
Ya turn your head toward the future and keep it movin'
Know what I'm sayin'?
Well say it again
Keep it movin'
Know what I'm sayin'?
Screw it then
Know what I'm sayin?

If you're waitin' for me to fail, your time is runnin' out on that clock
I'm runnin' to the finish yea, when I get there I ain't gonna stop
Success is what I couldn't have, but now I tell em look what I got

I'mma get up on a muthafuckin' sack and a big ass bottle to solve all my problems
I'm goin' in circles man, goin' in circles man
Sometimes I feel like, feel like I'm goin' in circles man

Damn, if you a man put some muthafuckin' food on the table
That's what she said but still a nigga wasn't able
To get up some bread for the rent, lights, and cable
The gas and water
She actin like I'm tryna starve her
And I know the baby growin' and her belly gotta eat too
Only thing I got left is this gun on my belt, If I can't feed myself how I'mma feed you?
How I'mma ride with this tank on empty, sellin yola hoping that the jakes dont get me
Cause when I leave the crib man that thang go wit' me
My nigga from the jets got stained for a 50
Sack of the hard
Tryna match you a broad
Got 'em shot up in his car by a muthafuckin' dope fiend
A bitch tryna get a fix, put my nigga in a ditch, we been hittin them licks since we was 14
Now they say you in a calmer place
I couldn't tell by the looks on yo' momma face
Now everytime she look at me I see a look of disgrace
She disappointed by the dreams we was lookin' to chase
Cause we was cookin' the base and we was flippin' the spinach
And if a nigga violated then we handled our business
We never knew one day the street shit would catch up with us
And I don't roll with many niggas, you was one of the realest
I'm like

[Chorus: x2]

Damn, open my mailbox and all I get to see is bill after bill
Shit kinda slow ain't no real money be comin' in but yo, I still got ten on the kil'
Ten on the drank, a nigga be on ten when I'm sober to get me over keep me full of the poison
My nigga Rich doin' a bid they sent the boys in, to get him if I would've been wit' him I woulda joined him
And now I'm out here lurkin' the streets wit' no work feelin' like my throat been cut wit' no plug
You know just what I mean if you ever done sold drugs, finna rob me a nigga cause I ain't got no love
And I ain't got no qualification for no career move, people up in corporate america probably fear dude
Gettin' shine off of my rhyme for like a year or two, still got the police lights up in my rearview
Damn, as I sit behind a tint, in a car full of smoke
Hopin' this officer don't do nothin' to make me have to hurt him cause it's over if I get caught up with this dope
Give me a coal, might aswell hang me from a rope
Cause the government lynchin' niggas more than ever before
Sort of like the slavery days but if we ? the change, then how the fuck is we supposed to grow?
They got a nigga like damn

Uhh Mr. Eon (The Mighty Mos Def)
The Mighty Mos (the E.C. Rawkus connection)
Coast to coast (from '88 to '99)
What? What? What? What?

It's on fire tonight
Everything on my side is lookin' alright
It's high power original, b-boy traditional
Raw bass material, huh, when individual
True brand imperial you're hearin' on your stereo
Transcribe the live, the Mos, Def init-ial
Sit BACK, and listen, you ain't, in no position
To deal with my conditional mentally and physical
Strength is indivisible, crews be comin' pitiful
Speech be sound typical, downfall habitual
Ock, I'm not feelin' you; don't know what your label
Tellin' you or what magic beans they sellin' you
I can flow, you can't though, example
Of a cat who just a modern day Sambo (yeah)
Who be bitchi'n out to A&R demands so
You can collect your little petty cash advance HOE
You knock-kneed and sloppy, but not me
I'm I-N-D, E-P-E, N-D-E-N-T

[Chorus]
It was a jam at the center, and the party was shakin'
And the poppers was poppin', and the breakers was breakin'
And it won't be long til everybody know that
B-boys rock the document! (document)

Yo, yo, you on the injured, I'm hot to death
I'm foul, plus I'm winnin', you think I shot the ref?
Rock a vest if you out of turn speakin'
'Cause I'm right there like nightmares;
I catch MC's while they sleepin'
I'm back these rap cats is wildin'
Got 'em in the studio poppin' Valiums, remasterin' they album
I'm about to re-up and restructure the case
You stuck, you about to get rearranged and replaced
I got plans for this rap game (uh-huh)
Put your head in the toilet and look son,
If you think my shit done changed
My shit is, out of your range, rip you out of your frame
Cop your tape, and the next day, copped an exchange
If you ain't, rockin' raw, what you rockin' for??
Without heat, y'all MC's, ain't hot no more
So for you lame cats tryin' to put your hit out
Try rockin' back and forth
It might be easier to get your shit out!

[Chorus]

I'm Jedi Master, Mase Windu, what you been through
Keep MC's heads wrapped like Erykah Ba-do
Hip-Hop's Cleon Jones, when Eon Jones
Wackest MC's, we pee on those
No need to impede The High and Mighty mystique
That shit would be as ignorant as Jimmy the Greek
Claimin' they Godzilla's when they really Godzooki
Got a mill' from Charlie Brown, when I kidnapped Snoopy
Eon, sale or performance, in any ordinance
Rhyme menace, that burst your verbal nuisance
In accordance, with all the laws from the cordless
Starbuck coming through, leavin any pimp whoreless
Stereo stompin' defeatin' me is like
Latrell chokin' up John Thompson, Charles Bronson
Had a Death Wish for this next to left shit

DJ Ideal,"Yo I was sold to a sick European by a rich African battlin'
Middle Passages, I can't go back again
Battlin' years of denyin' history, lies and mysteries
Wives with misty eyes watchin' their niggas be beaten viciously
Battle in the wilderness of North America
Ran by the river, only stoppin' to pray
Chased by predators
Terrorists with etiquette who vote and kill their president
Their capacity for evil so evident and prevalent
Ain't no hesitation involved, a nation dissolved
While we sit back waitin' to evolve
Those who would trade in their freedom
For their protection deserve neither
Fuck a name, fuck tradition
Religion, you learn Jesus
Turn the other cheek
Inherit the Earth, just stay meek
Fuck the way you speak
Try to walk, we chop off your feet
Fast forward to 2003, niggas beef
The psychology of children are slaves to run deep

What's beef? hell yeah, yeah yeah yeah yeah yo
That's beef, hell yeah, yeah yeah yeah yeah yo
It's always your own peoples
Sometimes it's your own peoples yo

Beef is not what Jay said to Nas
Beef is when workin' niggas can't find jobs
So they tryna find niggas to rob
Tryna find bigger guns so they can finish the job
Beef is when the crack kids can't find moms
Cause they end up inna pine box or locked behind bars
Beef ain't the Summer Jam for Hot 97
Beef is the cocaine and AIDS epidemic
Beef don't come with a radio edit
Beef is when the judge is callin' you ""defendant""
Beef, it comes with a long jail sentence
Handed down to you in a few short minutes
Beef is when your girl come through for a visit
Talkin' bout ""I'm pregnant by some other nigga""
Beef is high blood pressure and bad credit
Need a loan for your home and you're too broke to get it
And all your little kids is doin' is gettin' bigger
You tryin' not to raise 'em around these wild niggas
Beef is when a gold digger got ya seat and a
A manicured hand out like ""pay me nigga""
Or I'm tellin' your wife
Or startin' up some foul rumor that'll ruin your life
Beef is when a gangster ain't doin' it right
Another gangster then decided what to do with his life
Beef is not what these famous niggas do on the mic
Beef is what George Bush would do in a fight
Yeah, beef is not what Ja said to 50
Beef is more than Irv not bein' here with me
When a soldier ends his life with his own gun
Beef is tryin' to figure out what to tell his son
Beef is oil prices and geopolitics
Beef is Iraq, the West Bank, and Gaza Strip
Some beef is big and some beef is small
But what y'all call beef is not beef at all
Beef is real life happenin' everyday
And it's realer than them songs that you get at Kay Slay

Could burn the perm off big worm, so peace and pipe this greeting
Of the last action hero that be freezin' rappers dead in they tracks
Like sub zero (zero), 'cause Rico ain't no joke
I eat your flows and yo' beat up rappers even feel my presence
When I'm home with my feet up

For what you skied up or treed up
Relax and pull a seat up, make your landlord turn the heat up
Got the opposition shook like tiger woods about to tee up
So niggaz no competition with the clear mos definition
Mc's screamin' now for years can't rhyme without they mom's permission

DJ Ideal,"Hey hey, ha ha say what say what
Ha ha bust it yo
Sometimes I feel like I don't have a partner
Sometimes I feel like my only friend
Is the city I live in, is beautiful Brooklyn
Long as I live here believe I'm on fire hey
Cause it's the B-the-R-the-O-the-O-K
L-Y-N is the place where I stay
The B-the-R-the-O-the-O-K
Best in the world and all USA
It's the B-to-the-R-the-O-the-O-K
L-Y-N is the place where I stay
The B-to-the-R-the-O-the-O-K
Place where I rest is on my born day
Bust it, sometimes I sit back and just reflect
Watch the world go by and my thought connect
I think about the time past and the time to come
Reminisce on Bed-Stuy when I was pride and young
I used to try and come, to the neighborhood function
Throw on my Izod, say a little something
When I was just a younging, before the days of thugging
How me and Charlie Chims (hey yo what?) I'm only bugging
Fast forward, Nine-Now I gotta team my seed
I must proceed at God's speed to perform my deed
Livin the now space and time, round the nine to five
For as long as I'm alive, paw I got to strive
I ain't sitting roadside, that ain't harder to plan
I'm out here for my fam doing all that I can
I love my city, sweet and gritty in land to outskirts
Nickname Bucktown cause we grown to outburst
Philosophy redefine us, touch mines I touch back
Walk the streets like a sweet and get beat like drum tracks
Catch no shakes over jakes (boomp-boomp!) we bust back
Bring the marty to your face wit no place to run back
I'm from the slums that created the bass that thump back
This ain't a game clown, play ya James Brown and jump back
What you want, Jack? Young cats stash they jums at
Draw they guns back, momma screams where she sons at
Tryin to hunt that, recurring dream of high stakes
The fourth largest, first artist, Brooklyn is the place
Settled by the judge many years ago
Three billion strong and here we go

Good morning Vietnam!
Ha (back up back up back up back up back up)
Yo sometimes I sit back, reflect on the place that I live at
Unlike any place I ever been at
The home of big gats, deep dish hammer rim caps
Have a mishap, push ya wig back
Where you go to get the fresh trim at
Four on the Jake got the Timb rack
Blue collars metro carding it
Thugs mobbing it, form partnership
Increase armorment, street pharmacist
Deep consequence, when you seek sleek ornaments
You get caught, rode the white horse and can't get off
Big dogs that trick off just get sent off
They shoebox stash is all they seeds gotta live off
It's real yo but still yo, it's love here
And it's felt by anybody that come here
Out of towners take the train, plane and bus here
Must be something that they really want here
One year as a resident, deeper sentiment
Shout out ""Go Brooklyn!"", they representing it
Sitting on they front stoop sipping Guinesses
Using native dialect in they sentences
From the treeline blocks to the tenements
To the Mom & Pop local shop menaces
Travel all around the world in great distances
And ain't a place that I know that bear resemblance
That's why we it The Planet
Not a borough or a prov, it's our style that's uncalm
From ""sun"" to the ? to the Lafayette Gardens
White ""coff guawinas"" in they army jacket linings
Yo this goes out to my cats in Coney Isle
Friday night out in front The Himalaya goin wild
This goes out to Crown Heights and Smurv Village
The nighties, and all my ""yarda trenny"" Brown's Village
Parkside tenants caught, thirties, forties, and the fifties
The cats out in Starite City gettin busy
To the Hook, to the East, to the Stuy
Bushwick and Kanarcy, Farraget, Fullgreen, and Marcy
My Flatbush posse, generals of armies
When it's time to form, just call me
And let this song be, playing loud in Long B
If you love Bucktown strongly!
Raise it up!

Brooklyn my habitat, the place where it happen at
Live sway and the sharp balance of the battle axe
Irons is brandished at, thugs draw they hammer back
It's where you find the news tool crew cameras at
It's where my fam is at, summertime jam is at
They play Big and get you open like a sandal back
Hotter than candle wax, hustling you can't relax
The crack babies trying to find where they mama's at
It's off the handle black, wit big police scandals that
Turn into actions screenplays sold to Miramax
The type of place where they check your appearance at
And cats who know where all the hot 'lo gear is at
The stomping grounds, where you find a pound, smoke is that
Be blazing charm that have your wave cap floating back
The doorstep where the dispossessed posted at
Dope fiends out at Franklin Ave selling zovarax
You big balling better keep your money folded back
Cause once the young guns notice that it's over, black
Brooklyn keep on taking it, worldwide we known for that
Flossy cats get it snatched like the local tax
The place I sharpen up my baritone vocals at
Where one of the greatest MC's was a local cat",Brooklyn,2008
DJ Ideal,"Memories on the corners with the fo's and the mo's
Walk to the store for the rose, talking straightforward to hoes
Got uncles that smoke, and some put blow up they nose
To cope with the lows, the wind is cold and it blows
In their socks and their soles, niggas holding they rolls
Corners leave souls opened and closed, hoping for mo'
With nowhere to go, niggas rolling in droves
They shoot the wrong way, cause they ain’t knowin' their goals
The streets ain’t safe cause they ain’t knowing the code
By the foes I was told, either focus or fold
Got cousins with flows, hope they open some doors
So we can cop clothes and roll in a Rolls
Now I roll in a Olds, with windows that don’t roll
Down the roads where cars get broken and stole
These are the stories told by Stony and Cottage Grove
The world is cold, the block is hot as a stove
On the corners

I wish I could give you this feeling
I wish I could give this feeling
On the corners niggas rob or kill
And dying just to make a living, huh?

We overstated, we underrated, we educated
The corner was our time when time stood still and
Gators and snakeskins and
Yellow and pink and profiles

Street lights and deep nights, cats trying to eat right
Riding no-seat-bikes, with work to feed hypes
So they can get sweet Nike's, they head and they feet right
Desires of street life, cars and weed types
It’s hard to breathe nights, days are thief-like
The beasts roam the streets, the police is Greek-like
Game at its peak, we speak and believe hype
Bang in the streets hats cocked left or deep right
It’s steep life, coming up where niggas is sheep-like
Rappers and hoopers, we strive to be like
G's with three strikes, seeds that need light
Cheese and recite, needs and BE strife
The corner, where struggle and greed fight
We write songs about wrong ‘cause it’s hard to see right
Look to the sky, hoping it will bleed light
Reality's a bitch, and I heard that she bites
The corner

I wish I could give you this feeling
I wish I could give this feeling
On the corners niggas rob or kill
And dying just to make a living, huh?

The corner was our magic, our music, our politics
Fires raised as tribal dances and war cries
Broke out on different corners
Power to the people
Black power
Black is beautiful

Black church services, murderers, Arabs serving burgers
As cats with gold permanents, move they bags as herbalists
The dirt isn’t just fertile, it’s people working and earning this
The curb getters go where the cash flow and the current is
It’s so hot that niggas burn to live
The furnace is, where the money moving, the determined live
We talk shit, play lotto, and buy German beers
It’s so black packed with action that's affirmative
The corners

I wish I could give you this feeling
I wish I could give this feeling
On the corners niggas rob or kill
And dying just to make a living, huh?

The corner was our Rock of Gibraltar, our Stonehenge
Our Taj Mahal, our monument

And while you Cristal sippin', they rubbin' up they mittens
With heat in mint condition to start the getti-gettin'

You screamin' playa haters, these n****s is playa killers
Mr. Fash-ion, that style never last long
The harder you flash, the harder you get flashed on
There's hunger in the street that is hard to defeat
Many steal for sport, but more steal to eat
Cat's heavy at the weigh-in, and he's playin' for keeps
Don't sleep, they'll roll up in your pa**engers seat
There is universal law, whether rich or poor
Some say life's a game, to more, life is war
So put them egos to the side and get off them head-trips

Still down to load up they clip

And legend has it
That California is one of those spots

DJ Ideal,"In she came with the same type game
The type of girl giving out the fake cell phone and name
Big fame, she like cats with big thangs
Jewels chip, money clip, phone flip, the six range
I seen her on the Ave, spotted her more than once
Ass so fat that you could see it from the front
She spot me like paparazzi
Shot me a glance in that catwoman stance with the fat booty pants
Hot damn
What's your name love, where you came from
Neck and wrist laced up, very little make-up
The slims at the Reebok gym tone your frame up
Is sugar and spice the only thing that you made of
I tried to play it low key but couldn't keep it down
Asked her to dance she was like, yo I'm leaving now
An hour later, sounds from Jamaica
She sipping Cris straight up, skanking, winding her waist up
Scene two: my fam throwing the jam
Fareed is on the stand big things is in the plans
The brother Big Moon make space for me to move in
Hey, this my man Mos, baby let me introduce
I turn around, say word
It was the same pretty bird who I had priorly observed
Trying to play me for the herb
Shocked as hell she couldn't get it together
I just played along and pretended I never met her
How you feeling
Oh, I'm fine
My name is Mos
I'm Sharice
I heard so much good about you it's nice to finally meet
We moved to the booth reserved for crew especially
And honey-love ended up sitting directly next to me
I'm type polite but now I'm looking at her skeptically
Cause baby girl got all the right weaponry
Designer fabric, shoes, and accessories
Chinky eyes, sweet voice is fucking with me mentally
We conversated, made a laugh, yeah you know me bro
Even though I know the steelo, she wild sweet, yo
I'm about to murk, I say peace to the family
She hop up like, how you gon' leave before you dance with me

Yo, let me apologize for the other night, I know it wasn't right
But baby you know what its like, some brothers don't be coming right
I understand, I'm feeling you, besides
Can I have a dance ain't really that original
We laughed about it, traced her arms across my shoulder blades
They playing Lovers Rock, I got the folded fingers on her waist
Heating my blood up like the Arizona summer
Song finished then she whispered honey, let's exchange numbers
Scene three: weeks of dating late night conversation
In the crib heart racing, trying to be cool and patient
She touched on my eyelids, the room fell silent
She walked away smiling, singing Gregory Issac
Like, if I don't, if I don't
Showing me that tan line and that tattoo
Playing Sade, Sweetest Taboo
Burning candles, all my other plans got cancelled
Man I smashed it like an Idaho potato
She call me at my J.O., come now, I can't say no
Ginseng tree trunks, rocking the P-funk
Cocking her knees up, champion lover not ease up
Three months, she call I feel I'm running a fever
Six months, I'm telling her I desperately need her
Nine months, flu-like symptoms when shorty not around
I need more than to knock it down I'm really trying to lock it down
Midnight we hook up and go at it
Burn a stoge and let her know, sweetheart I got to have it
She telling me commitment is something she can't manage
Wake up the next morning, she gone like it was magic
Ah damn it, my shit is on Harrison Ford frantic
My 911's unanswered by my fly Taurus enchantress
Next week, Moon hit me up, I saw Sharice at the kitty club
With some banging ass Asian playing lay it down and lick me up

Escuchela, la ciudad respirando

Escuchela

[Mos Def]
The new moon rode high in the crown of the metropolis
Shining, like who on top of this?
People was hustling, arguing and bustling
Gangsters of Gotham hardcore hustling
I'm wrestling with words and ideas
My ears is picky, seeking what will transmit
The scribes can apply to transcript, yo
This ain't no time where the usual is suitable
Tonight alive, let's describe the inscrutable
The indisputable, we New York the narcotic
Strength in metal and fiber optics
Where mercenaries is paid to trade hot stock tips
For profits, thirsty criminals take pockets
Hard knuckles on the second hands of working class watches
Skyscrapers is colossus, the cost of living
Is preposterous, stay alive, you play or die, no options
No Batman and Robin, can't tell between
The cops and the robbers, they both partners, they all heartless
With no conscience, back streets stay darkened
Where unbeliever hearts stay hardened
My eagle talons stay sharpened, like city lights stay throbbing
You either make a way or stay sobbing, the Shiny Apple
Is bruised but sweet and if you choose to eat
You could lose your teeth, many crews retreat
Nightly news repeat, who got shot down and locked down
Spotlight to savages, NASDAQ averages
My narrative, rose to explain this existence
Amidst the harbor lights which remain in the distance

So much on my mind that it can't recline
Blasting holes in the night til she bled sunshine
Breathe in, inhale vapors from bright stars that shine
Breathe out, weed smoke retrace the skyline
Heard the bass ride out like an ancient mating call
I can't take it y'all, I can feel the city breathing
Chest heaving, against the flesh of the evening
Sigh before we die like the last train leaving

[Talib Kweli]
Breathing in deep city breaths, sitting on shitty steps
We stoop to new lows, hell froze the night the city slept
The beast crept through concrete jungles
Communicating with one another
And ghetto birds where waters fall
From the hydrants to the gutters
The beast walk the beats, but the beats we be making
You on the wrong side of the track, looking visibly shaken
Taken them plungers, plunging to death that's painted by the numbers
With crime unapplied pressure, cats is playing God
But having children by a lesser baby mother but fuck it
We played against each other like puppets, swearing you got pull
When the only pull you got is the wool over your eyes
Getting knowledge in jail like a blessing in disguise
Look in the skies for God, what you see besides the smog
Is broken dreams flying away on the wings of the obscene
Thoughts that people put in the air
Places where you could get murdered over a glare
But everything is fair
It's a paradox we call reality
So keeping it real will make you casualty of abnormal normality
Killers Born Naturally like, Micky and Mallory
Not knowing the ways'll get you capped like an NBA salary
Some cats be emceeing to illustrate what we be seeing
Hard to be a spiritual being when shit is shakin what you believe in
For trees to grow in Brooklyn, seeds need to be planted
I'm asking if y'all feel me AND THE CROWD LEFT ME STRANDED
My blood pressure boiled and rose, cause New York niggaz
Actin spoiled at shows, to the winners the spoils go
I take the L, transfer to the 2, head to the gates
New York life type trife the Roman Empire state

[Mos Def]
So much on my mind I just can't recline
Blasting holes in the night til she bled sunshine
Breathe in, inhale vapors from bright stars that shine
Breathe out, weed smoke retrace the skyline
Yo don't the bass ride out like an ancient mating call
I can't take it y'all, I can feel the city breathin
Chest heaving, against the flesh of the evening
Sigh before we die like the last train leaving

Escuchela, respirando ?

[Common]
Yo, on The Amen, Corner I stood looking at my former hood
Felt the spirit in the wind, knew my friend was gone for good
Threw dirt on the casket, the hurt, I couldn't mask it
Mixing down emotions, struggle I hadn't mastered
I choreograph seven steps to heaven
And hell, waiting to exhale and make the bread leavened
Veteran of a cold war It's Chica-I-go for
What I know or, what's known
So some days I take the bus home, just to touch home
From the crib I spend months gone
Sat by the window with a clutched dome listening to shorties cuss long
Young girls with weak minds, but they butt strong
Tried to call, or at least beep the Lord, but didn't have a touch-tone
It's a dog-eat-dog world, you gotta mush on
Some of this land I must own
Outta the city, they want us gone
Tearing down the 'jects creating plush homes
My circumstance is between Cabrini and Love Jones
Surrounded by hate, yet I love home
Ask my God how he thought traveling the world sound
Found it hard to imagine he hadn't been past downtown
It's deep, I heard the city breathe in its sleep
Of reality I touch, but for me it's hard to keep
Deep, I heard my man breathe in his sleep
Of reality I touch, but for me it's hard to keep

[Mos Def]
So much on my mind I just can't recline
Blasting holes in the night til she bled sunshine
Breathe in, inhale vapors from bright stars that shine

I've been lonely
I've been waiting for you
I'm pretending
And thats all I can do
The love I'm sending ain't making it through to your hear

I shed tears cause im told that they'll heal
You tell the truth I don't know how to feel
Never felt alone in a room full of friends
Got big plans but you leave em in suspense
Pray for me, patience wait for me
Pay dues, trust me they aint comin
Way back it was hoops, now its maybach coups
And we all took a vow, no squares in the loops

Never snitch, got it tattooed by kartoo?

You've been hiding, never letting it show
Always trying, to keep it under control

But they keep takin pictures of my jewells in the light

Fortune n fame are pleasures you couldn't fathem
But fortunately for me my fortune built me a palace
Benjamins by the pallet, im spendin em mighty daily
I know I'm under sureveillance ( I look at it as a talent)
Millions a gotta manage, lil talents up in the rappin
Im such a threat to these n*ggaz (you never know what could happen)
I started without a coin, not knowin which way im goin
Now im chowderin ?, n readin em a few poems
Weathered all of the storms, now its time to see the light
I never felt this way bout anythin in my life
Determined to be the best, not lookin back at regrets
How many people you blessed is how you measure success

Listen pimpin', let me tell you what the business is
Ya'll are [?] I'm a tell you what the difference is
See we old school, you just old news
We used to move blow and you just blow dude
See we the talk of the town me and my whole crew
You run around town gossip like whole dude
See your name drop when nobody knows you
We get them lames out of shakin like we supposed to
My crew we cock the bentley brooklyn and the road too
You gift her roses I'm the one she brings the rose to
So you say your shinin well I guess I'm shinin more
So high up I'm soaring thirty and I'm like a dinasoar
Cannivor, meet here G's they respect

Back to ballin, getting bread, bringing checks in
Yeah, like we did on my last case
I show you how to make a blessin out of bad breaks
Let me set these niggas ass straight
Holding up there clothes bags up losing up fag bait
Them hot pants bad for your prize state
Lime green, hot pink, a drag queen hot date
In stores asking for the same size the bitches buy
They say it's here, but where I'm from we call it sissy fairy

Ay, before us there was none
After us no more there will ever be
This the greatest show on earth you will ever see
Still do it for my niggas in the street getting to it
Blowing money like my nigga Big Meech used to do it
Say we blowing money fast, big old money bag
Three four hundred carrots just to make them suckas mad
Back in the side of the winner of every battle
And the best since I was rapping in a rattle world travel
As you comment on the rumors of what have you bewared dude
Prayer can't prepare you how dare you
Disrespect my presence peasents I will tear you
A new one, I poop on your egos and move on
Rolls Royce back seat no grey coupon
A true don, three piece polished suit on
Pee on, see it ain't no neon in my new one
Tear the truth on every song I spew on (blaww!)

She was struggling with bags from Tesco
There were people from the city havin lunch in the park
I believe that it's called AL fresco
Then a kid came along to offer a hand
But before she had time to accept it
Hits her over the head, doesn't care if she's dead
Cause he's got all her jewelery and wallet

You might laugh you might frown
Walkin' round London town

DJ Inamasu,"Early in the morning, risin' to the street
Light me up that cigarette and I strap shoes on my feet
Got to find a reason, a reason things went wrong
Got to find a reason why my money's all gone
I got a dalmatian, and I can still get high
I can play the guitar like a motherfucking riot

Well, life is too short, so love the one you got
'Cause you might get run over or you might get shot
Never start static I just get it off my chest
Never had to battle with no bulletproof vest
Take a small example, take a tip from me
Take all of your money, give it all to charity

Love is what I got
Within my reach
And the Sublime style's still straight from Long Beach
It all comes back to you, you'll finally get what you deserve
Try and test that you're bound to get served

Love's what I got
Don't start a riot
You'll feel it when the dance gets hot

Lovin', is what I got, I said remember that
Lovin', is what I got, I said remember that

(That's) why I don't cry when my dog runs away
I don't get angry at the bills I have to pay
I don't get angry when my Mom smokes pot
Hits the bottle and goes right to the rock
Fuckin' and fightin', it's all the same
Livin' with Louie dog's the only way to stay sane
Let the lovin', let the lovin' come back to me

Lovin', is what I got, I said remember that
Lovin', is what I got, I said remember that

Lovin', is what I got, I said remember that
Lovin', is what I got, I said remember that

DJ Infamous Haze,"It's like I got a death wish, but niggas can't kill me
Live my long these real niggas gotta feel me
The media, they ridicule me
Heartless is how they really fez
Wanna prosecute me till I'm living in the cell
Or I rot in hell
Will I die in these streets only time will tell
Until then I pop pills, sip my purple
Spread love, money and guns throughout my circle
Make the ass out the feds every case I beat
Middle finger to the law nigga fuck police
For my niggas over the wall who they won't let free
And all the soldier that we've lost, may they rest in peace
Tell your mother who's alive, who said crime don't pay
Nigga fuck how you get it homie find your way
Young bucks keep your guns pulled enemies closer
Smile, look death in his eyes

Cops ? shot? no ? raised in the ghetto
I'm just a product of the block

The ghetto cold, the block hot
Niggas talking, nosy neighbors and everything
But a coffin, the hood filled with dope fiends and street walkers
Babies crying, hop signs, dogs barking
Crime scene, yellow tape, the street chalking
Bloody sheet cover the face of the departed
The blood drop and then she hardens
Cops celebrate the ? gun, this often
Young bitch 14 6 months pregnant
Sell her body on the corner, smoke weed on a regular
Get a pimp off her money, dope man he was? 
Last week raped twice forced abortions
It's the life that I'm living ghetto that I'm lost in
And I'mma be here till they put me in the coffin
Feeling like pac live and die in Phillie
And I'm riding till these niggas come and kill me

Cops ? shot? no ? raised in the ghetto
I'm just a product of the block

My crystal popping on politicians and scooping watching
Pop a ? on who you blaming on cops lock them
A jail cell can't rehabilitate a nigga
They raise your bell and give a crack dealer life sentence
Turn around and give a pedal to the floor till you fall
That's why a prison door, over a revolving door
3 hots and a ? it's all we got, ? for Big and Pac

Who ever knew when that child was born
He'd be Barack
44th president to be black, you gotta deal with that
Confess that I heard were crack, we gotta deal with that
Wonder why we put in the bags and throw still with that
See a phantom like beans I kill for that
Hood nigga going rich, now I got a mill for that
Law suit she's bringing, swear I've been through
With paying nigga in full, it's getting shot through his fuel
Known thug, since my brother got killed in cold blood
So would I avenge his death, so would I sell drugs
Promised to be a real nigga to the death of me
Bury my casket to the block with the rest of me
And let my headstone really was a father
Any nigga that thought he went hard, I went harder
So state out my bidness and off my mind
I take a shot to the downfall, I'm on my grind

Lil mama get gangsta for me, stuff it in your Prada bag)
That's right, she's got something that I wanna see
That's right, so if she leave, she fucking with me
That's life, twerk something, work something, hurt something

Do what you wanna do, drug test on you

Big mills, big deals 'bout a hundred in a vault
Sit still, that real, lotta haters throw salt
They lost big Game give a fuck how you feel
I fear she just might just pop that pill
And feel on me all night till the tip spill
Tip scales with her waistline, sex with the bass line
She gon' fuck a snare drum one drink at a time

Blow right, hoes fight over my name
I got my dough right, hustle running all in my veins
It's forty days, forty nights if I'm making it rain
I reign supreme, a bottle and some bomb-ass weed and we good

Let me see your hands in the air
Narcotics in the club and the ladies love us
So let's get high off something
High of something, high of something
'til your mothafucking brain don't function
High of something, high of something

Fireworks when I spark, yellow tape
Lotta chalk thought you said you a boss
Big deal, bitch chill, pulling out that black card
Showin' off big spendin', letting alcohol spill
I feel she might just get too faded
X-rated that's what I like glad that you made it
To this ceremony at hand, take a sip lets plan
For the future, introduce you to Snoop get you right and

May I, kick a little something for G's and
Make a few ends as I breeze through?
The shit on my hip is a fucking preview
And guess what it lead to

I'm your man; I'm trying to recover the sweet love that we knew
You understand that my heart can't go on beating without you
Well, your loveliness has wounded me, I'm reeling from the blow
I wish I knew what it was keeps me loving you so
I'm breathing hard, standing at the gate
But I don't know how much longer I can wait

Skies are grey, I'm looking for anything that will bring a happy glow
Night or day, it doesn't matter where I go anymore; I just go
If I ever saw you coming I don't know what I would do
I'd like to think I could control myself, but it isn't true
That's how it is when things disintegrate
And I don't know how much longer I can wait

I'm doomed to love you, I've been rolling through stormy weather
I'm thinking of you and all the places we could roam together

To say what I need to say
But I'm quite sure that you'll tell me

I can and shall obey
But if it wasn't for your misfortunes
I'd be a heavenly person today

I know I might seem weird 
One day I'm around, the next I disappear 
This is a crazy act 
But I won't think I'm kissing you till that's a fact 
Cause always, ever after and more 

[Chorus] 
When you think the party's over 
Look over your shoulder 
I'm at your door, coming back for more 
Dancing in the moonlight 
Till the break of daylight 
Like we did before 
Well be coming back for more 

Were on a one-way ride 
And all I need is someone like you by my side 
You saw the movie too 
Well ride into the sunset like they always do 
For all days, all nights 
Ill hurt some more 

[Chorus] 

Well be coming back for more 
If I'm still number one 
The one you're looking for 
I won't be gone for long 
No, Ill be back for more

DJ Jamad,"Sitting here, guess I didn' make bail 
Got time and a story to tell 
Started when I was nine years old 
Woke up and daddy was gone 
I started hustling and the couldn't tell me nothing 
Fronting in the hood, trying to be somebody 
My soul was on empty 
I was searching for something 
Tried to be good 
Tried to keep from trouble 
Living too fast 
Trying to make a good hustle 

Sometimes it gets rough 
Comin' from where I'm from, I'm from 
Times got hard 
Comin' from where I'm from, I'm from 
Sometimes you gotta walk to work 
Comin' from where I'm from, I'm from 
Sometimes you gotta do a little dirt 
Comin' from where I'm from, I'm from 

Wasn' really looking guess I found it 
Five foot three light brown skinned 
Coming from the university 
Lifestyle looking kind of lovely 
Didn't know she had much game 
Down to ride out, even take the train 
Even take her to a poker game 
Top notch fried chicken and sushi 
Tried to be good 
Tried to treat you like a lady 
Tried to be your friend 
Turned out that you were shady 

Sometimes it gets lonely 
Comin' from where I'm from, I'm from 
Some times ain't what they seem to be 
Comin' from where I'm from, I'm from 
Some times would get the best of me 
Comin' from where I'm from, I'm from 

Well, tried to be good (I tried, I tried) 
Wanted nothing but to love somebody 
Didn't want to die young 
Steady hustling trying to feed my family 
Too scared to have kids and like daddy did 
'Cause I'm so scared of failing 
Sometimes it gets hard 
Comin' from where I'm from, I'm from 

Comin' from where I'm from, I'm from 
Sometimes you gotta moan 
Comin' from where I'm from, I'm from 
Sometimes you gotta cry a little louder 
Comin' from where I'm from, I'm from 
Sometimes you gotta fight the pain 
Comin' from where I'm from, I'm from 
Sometimes you get a little worried 
Comin' from where I'm from, I'm from 
Sometimes you get lost out of touch 
Comin' from where I'm from, I'm from 
Sometimes I think I pray a little to much 
Comin' from where I'm from, I'm from 
Sometimes I get a little scared 
Comin' from where I'm from, I'm from",Comin' from Where I'm From,

[Verse 1]
Real People walk in the streets, the streets is talkin'
Often it's beef this city never does
People walk and talk in they sleep
Cold sweats and wet dreams
On how to get green our faith is all in a jeep
Black souls raw and they deep
Hypes tryin' to talk with no teeth
Shorties sayin' ball or retreat
A lesson we all speak at one point or another
What you expect from one who smoke a joint with his mother
Anointed hustlers in a fatherless region
Through the pain wish they know that God was just teachin'
We want decent homes
So dreams we say out loud like speaker phones just to keep em on
It's like a colored song that keep keepin' on
I guess knowin' I'm weak is when I'm really bein' strong
Somehow through the dust I could see the dawn
Like the Bishop Magic Juan, that's why I write freedom songs
For the real people

[Verse 2]
I wonder is the spirits of Bob Marley and Haile Selassie
Watch me as the cops be tryin' to and pop and lock me
They cocky, plus they mentality is Nazi
The way they treat blacks I wanna snap like paparazzi
We're the children of a better God searchin' for better jobs
We could cop ghetto cars tryin' not to catch a charge
They say the dope game is sour
Now they doin' homework that's when they follow you for hours
Come to your crib and devour all that you work for
Must be more than paper these niggas hurt for
Through the purple haze I circle days I rhyme that work for pays
Tryna reverse the slave's mind and insert the brave mentality
Heard that it's drama at home
Can a dude break free and still get honored at home
I was told by a chief it's the games nature
When you're glowin' some will love and some will hate ya
It's real people

[Verse 3]
Black men walking wit white girls on they arms
I be mad at em as if I know they moms
Told to go beyond the surface, a person's a person
When we lessen our women our condition seems to worsen
The weary cursin' the sky
Talkin' to themselves givin' the version of why help and hurt in they eye
I live across from it, some of it I do be in
I be showin' niggas lives
Like UPN
It's real people

I can't help it the studio where Paul be at
Tried to walk away from it but it called me back
Forget my pride shit I even quit my job
For the one that I love to work music
Recognized by my art that I spill in my game
Pour my heart on the track and have you feeling my pain
Seen a lot of hard times on the way to success
When I'm mad writing a rhyme is my way to express
Lay back and fall deep in a verse
If I was out in the street yo I probably lay a sleep in a hearse
There's nothing like when you on a mic tearing a track
Then you come from out the booth and start hearing it back
Everybody their love the sound that's why they give you hugs and pounds
Now you know you was spittin it
You got the whole run vibing the same
You ain't doing this for dollars and chains

(Yo I'm feeling you yams do the same thing yo)

For the love of the game
Only deal in dollars and change
Switch places for big faces one and the same
With Snares and kicks prepared to mix
In the booth till I'm dead
No roof on my head
Keep the tools in the shed
Got a place to lay
But a place to stay
That's what I deal with on a day to day
Phone off heat off loan shark spaghetti no meat balls
At least y'all can eat y'all can feel my pain
When a cloudy day feel my rain
No food no drink just hunger pains
Thinkin of that day who this chrome gonna kill
Smiling women face for a home cooked meal
Right now I hate my life
But love the way I write
For real I think I seen my death
Think I like bumming g's from Jeff
Pockets on my cheese on e and they seems on f
I'm a hard working all nighter ass cat see sack song writer worldwide doom ball rider
Feel my blood and tears but the love for the drug got me loved and revered
From these thugs for years
It's the game yo

Love what you do
And do what you Love (for the game)
Just for just for hip hop and not for rap yo
Love what you do
And do what you Love (for the game)
Just for just for hip hop and not for rap

Yo black it seem like we both feeling the same
Remember when I walked away and you were still in the game
(Uh ha)
That shit was hot I'm still feeling the flame
Plus you never forgot every other verse spilling my name
Chilling with dames to will they range killin their brain with game
If not cousin I be still on the train
Like you said we ain't willing to change
I'm feeling you making
Damn see family and we
Stick together
Shows overseas spit together
No doubt for the love of the game
We gonna keep staying the same
When you not around laying your dame
Getting paper from a play in a lane
Keep heat for any hater wanna test the rap
And even more on the wax so sat Jeff is phat

I attest to that
Still walk with dress room back
Same ghetto
Same whip
Still stressed on whack
Just wanna back y'all nothin less than that
Just want some cash cars and them records with black
It's just a game yo
But whether or not
I still got love for hip hop
It's the game

Love what you do
And do what you Love (for the game)

DJ Jazzy Jeff,"(Intro/Chorus)

It's just the things that you do (5x)

The way you do the things you do

(Verse 1)

8:05, the alarm clock sound

I grab my shoe and turn the damn thing down

But now it's 9 o'clock and I still ain't up up yet

Work on time, yeah I admire the concept

You got me yearnin??? and I mean anticipating

Seeing you I can't wait and so not concentrate

My mind is blind of all the time, thinking of you

And the way you do things you do

(Chorus)

(Verse 2)

I walk in the park for a midnight rendevous

For a slow dance, romance, my motive is see through

I wanna be with you

But I ain't hiding

A wave of love and I'm gliding and ridening

Things like that when you hear me

Sayin' sort of sounds like that same old clich??

Climbing the highest mountain and swimming the deepest sea

But I can't front, I want you to be want me

Cause baby when you grab me tightly

You send chills and tend to insight me

When you caress and fumble me lightly

Oh girl watch up cause she might be

Settin' yourself up the way that you tease me

Sooner or later you might have to please me

It's just something about you

The way you do things you do

(Chorus)

(Verse 3)

Now why oh why would an incredibly fly guy like me

Be chasing one lady

It's just something about you

The way you carry yourself when you're out you

Seem to have a sort of captivating style, I've parked the feelin'

But your whip is appealing

Since this is a subject that I brought up

I just mind as well admit that I'm caught up

It ain't the clothes that you're wearin'

Your perfume or the style that that your hair's in

It ain't your body, how slim your waist is

Your new jeans and how pretty your face is

But I feel funny when it close proximity

Make it wonder what's gettin' in to me

It's just something about you

The way you do the things you do

(Chorus)

(Bridge)

It's nothing that you do (2x)

The way you do the things you do

(Verse 4)

The mystery???s of this world I ponder

Just sittin' back let my mind wonder

What the, why the, who the, how the hell is this young lady

Drive me so crazy

Reply in thought pose like the thinker

I play you with kiss or a wink

Or a smile just to show you

It's something about you

The way you do the things you do

Come here, come here

Come on out, don't worry

You want me to chase you don't you?

Just come here, I've got you now

Sss

The way you do the things you

(Chorus)

It's just the things that you do

(the way you do the things you do) (10x)

The way (repeated several times)

DJ Jazzy Jeff,"You know parents are the same
No matter time nor place
They don't understand that us kids
Are going to make some mistakes
So to you, all the kids all across the land
There's no need to argue
Parents just don't understand
""Parents"" 24 lines, 734 characters.

I remember one year
My mom took me school shopping
It was me, my brother, my mom, oh, my pop, and my little sister
All hopped in the car
We headed downtown to the Gallery Mall
MY mom started bugging with the clothes she chose
I didn't say nothing at first
I just turned up my nose
She said, ""What's wrong? This shirt cost $20""
I said, ""Mom, this shirt is plaid with a butterfly collar!""
The next half hour was the same old thing
My mother buying me clothes from 1963
And then she lost her mind and did the ultimate
I asked her for Adidas and she bought me Zips!
I said, ""Mom, what are you doing, you're ruining my rep""
She said, ""You're only sixteen, you don't have a rep yet""
I said, ""Mom, let's put these clothes back, please""
She said ""no, you go to school to learn not for a fashion show""
I said, ""This isn't Sha Na Na, come on Mom, I'm not Bowzer
Mom, please put back the bell-bottom Brady Bunch trousers
But if you don't want to I can live with that but
You gotta put back the double-knit reversible slacks""
She wasn't moved - everything stayed the same
Inevitably the first day of school came
I thought I could get over, I tried to play sick
But my mom said, ""No, no way, uh-uh, forget it""
There was nothing I could do, I tried to relax
I got dressed up in those ancient artifacts
And when I walked into school, it was just as I thought
The kids were cracking up laughing at the clothes Mom bought
And those who weren't laughing still had a ball
Because they were pointing and whispering
As I walked down the hall
I got home and told my Mom how my day went
She said, ""If they were laughing you don't need the,
""Cause they're not good friends""
For the next six hours I tried to explain to my Mom
That I was gonna have to go through this about 200 more times
So to you all the kids all across the land
There's no need to argue
Parents just don't understand

OK, here's the situation
""parents"" 68 lines, 2662 characters.
My parents went away on a week's vacation and
They left the keys to the brand new Porsche
Would they mind?
Umm, well, of course not
I'll just take it for a little spin
And maybe show it off to a couple of friends
I'll just cruise it around the neighborhood
Well, maybe I shouldn't
Yeah, of course I should
Pay attention, here's the thick of the plot
I pulled up to the corner at the end of my block
That's when I saw this beautiful girlie girl walking
I picked up my car phone to perpetrate like I was talking
You should've seen this girl's bodily dimensions
I honked my horn just to get her attention
She said, ""Was that for me?""
I said, ""Yeah""
She said, ""Why?""
I said, ""Come on and take a ride with a helluva guy""
She said, ""How do I know you're not sick?
You could be some deranged lunatic""
I said, ""see 'mon toots, my name is the Prince
Beside, would a lunatic have a Porsche like this?""
She agreed and we were on our way
She was looking very good and so was I, I must say - word
We hit McDonald's, pulled into the drive
We ordered two Big Macs and two large fries with Cokes
She kicked her shoes off onto the floor
She said, ""Drive fast, speed turns me on""
She put her hand on my knee, I put my foot on the gas
We almost got whiplash, I took off so fast
The sun roof was open , the music was high
And this girl's hand was steadily moving up my thigh
She had opened up three buttons on her shirt so far
I guess that's why I didn't notice that police car
We're doing ninety in my Mom's new Porsche
And to make this long story short - short
When the cop pulled me over I was scared as hell
I said, ""I don't have a license but I drive very well, officer""
I almost had a heart attack that day
Come to find out the girl was a twelve-year-old runaway
I was arrested, the car was impounded
There was no way for me to avoid being grounded
My parents had to come off from vacation to get me
I'd rather be in jail than to have my father hit me
My parents walked in
I got my grip, I said, ""Ah, Mom, Dad, how was your trip?""
They didn't speak
I said, ""I want to plead my case""
But my father just shoved me in the car by my face
That was a hard ride home, I don't know how I survived
They took turns -
One would beat me while the other one was driving
I can't believe it, I just made a mistake
Well parents are the same no matter time nor place
So to you all the kids all across the land
Take it form me

The hot hot music, the hot music
The hot hot music, the hot music
The hot hot music, the hot music

Yo, one, two, one-two one-two
That's how we usually start, once again it's the Thought
The Dalai Lama of the mic, the prime minister Thought
This directed to whoever in listening range
Yo the whole state of things in the world bout to change
Black rain fallin' from the sky look strange
The ghetto is red hot, we steppin' on flames
Yo, it's inflation on the price for fame
And it was all the same, but then the antidote came
The Black Thought, ill syllablist, out the Fifth
This heavyweight rap shit I'm about to lift
LIKE, a phyllum lift up it's seed to sunlight
I plug in the mic, draw like a gunfight
I never use a cordless, or stand applaudless
Sippin' cholorophyll out of ill silver goblets
I'm like a faucet, monopoly's the object
There ain't no way to cut this tap, you got ta get wet
Your head is throbbin' and I ain't said shit yet

You are now in tune to the sounds

The hot hot music, the hot music

Word up, the formation of words to fit
That's what I usually disturb you with
A lot of rappers never heard of this, or know half the time it is
You doubt the Illa-Fifth, what could you accomplish?
Whether they skywriting your name, or you anonymous
You be speechless, with stinging sinuses
The Roots royal highnesses through your monitors
I tilt my crown, then blow down a diamond kiss
You need to buy a CD and stop rewindin' this
I'm the finalist, shinin' like a rugged amethyst
And at your music conference, I'm the panelist
Listen close to my poetry, I examine this
Like an analyst, to see if you can handle this
Check it out
You, got the groove, emcees
Freeze, stand still, nobody move
Unless you dealin' with The Next Movement
The P-Phi-D we be the mon-u-ment
I live my life nice, but I'm not too bent
You theatrical as a Broadway play, this ain't Rent
One hundred percent, straight out the Basement
Spreading this across a planet on some next shit
How many people feelin this love music? C'mon

Yo, you go
Hey you listeners, stop what you're doin' and
