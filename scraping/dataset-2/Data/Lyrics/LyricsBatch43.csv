Cher,"I was five and he was six 
We rode on horses made of sticks 
He wore black and I wore white 
He would always win the fight 

[Chorus]
Bang bang, he shot me down 
Bang bang, I hit the ground 
Bang bang, that awful sound 
Bang bang, my baby shot me down 

Seasons came and changed the time 
And I grew up, I called him mine 
He would always laugh and say 
""Remember when we used to play?"" 

Bang bang, I shot you down 
Bang bang, you hit the ground 
Bang bang, that awful sound 
Bang bang, I used to shoot you down 

Music played and people sang 
Just for me the church bells rang 

Now he's gone I don't know why 
Until this days sometimes I cry 
He didn't even say goodbye 
He didn't take the time to lie

Cher,"I was born in the wagon of a travelin' show
My mama used to dance for the money they'd throw
Papa would do whatever he could
Preach a little gospel, sell a couple bottles of
Doctor Good

Gypsys, tramps, and thieves
We'd hear it from the people of the town
They'd call us gypsys, tramps, and thieves
But every night all the men would come around
And lay their money down

Picked up a boy just south of
Mobile Gave him a ride, filled him with a hot meal I was sixteen, he was twenty-one
Rode with us to Memphis
And papa woulda shot him if he knew what he'd done

Gypsys, tramps, and thieves
We'd hear it from the people of the town
They'd call us gypsys, tramps, and thieves
But every night all the men would come around
And lay their money down

I never had schoolin' but he taught me well
With his smooth southern style
Three months later I'm a gal in trouble
And I haven't seen him for a while, uh-huh I haven't seen him for a while, uh-huh

She was born in the wagon of a travelin' show
Her mama had to dance for the money they'd throw
Grandpa'd do whatever he could
Preach a little gospel, sell a couple bottles of

Cher,"You're struttin' into town like you're slingin' a gun
Just a small town dude with a big city attitude
Honey are you lookin' for some trouble tonight
Well alright

You think you're so bad, drive the women folk wild
Shoot 'em all down with the flash of your pearly smile
Honey but you met your match tonight
Oh, that's right

You think you'll knock me off my feet
'til I'm flat on the floor
'Til my heart is cryin' Indian and I'm begin' for more
So come on baby
Come on baby
Come on baby show me what that loaded gun is for

If you can give it
I can take it
'Cause if this heart is gonna break it's gonna take a lot to break it
I know tonight
Somebody's gonna win the fight
So if you're so tough
Come on and prove it

Your heart is down for the count and you know you're gonna lose it
Tonight you're gonna go down in flames
Just like Jesse James

You're an outlaw lover and I'm after your hide
Well you ain't so strong, won't be long 'til your hands are tied
Tonight I'm gonna take you in 
Dead or Alive
That's right

You break the laws of love in the name of desire
Take ten steps back
'Cause I'm ready baby
Aim and fire
Baby there's nowhere you gonna run tonight
Ooh That's right

Well you've had your way with love but it's the end of the day
Now a team of wild horses couldn't drag your heart away

So come on baby
Come on baby

Come on baby you know there ain't nothing left to say

If you can give it
I can take it
'Cause if this heart is gonna break it's gonna take a lot to break it

Cher,"Sometimes when I'm down and all alone
Just like a child without a home
The love you give me keeps me hangin' on
Oh honey,  all I ever need is you
You're my first love, you're my last
You're my future, you're my past
And loving you is all I ask, honey
All I ever need is you
Winters come and they go, and we watch the melting snow
Sure as summer follows spring, all the things you do
Give me a reason to build my world around you
Some men follow rainbows, I am told
Some men search for silver some for gold
I have found my treasure in your soul, honey
All I ever need is you
Without love I'd never find the way
Through ups and downs of every single day
I won't sleep at night until you say, my honey
All I ever need is you",All I Ever Need Is You,2003

Baby don't go,
Pretty baby please don't go
I never had a mother,
I hardly knew my dad
I've been in town for eighteen years
You're the only boy I've had
I can't stay,
Maybe I'll be back some day

Baby don't go,
Pretty baby please don't go
I love you so,
Pretty baby please don't go

I never had no money
I bought at the second hand store
The way this old town laughs at me
I just can't take it no more
I can't stay,
I'm gonna be a lady some day

Baby don't go,
Pretty baby please don't go
I love you so,
Pretty baby please don't go

When I get to the city,
My tears will all be dry
My eyes will look so pretty
No one's gonna know I cried
Yes I'm goin' away,
Maybe I'll be back some day

Baby don't go,
Maybe I'll be back some day
Baby don't go

Along the sand

And catch the wind

When the sundown pales the sky
I want hide a while
Behind your smile
Everywhere I look
Your eyes I'd find

For me to love you now
Would be the sweetest thing

The leaves with tears

To kill my fears

Coming back to win
Starting over again, take the first step

Never deny, the fear that your heart defends
Find your way out, just when you've reached the end

When the heart is on
Starting over again, gotta come back
And turn it around, starting over

Never, no lookin' back

Til I was sweet and sour

I kissed you, I kissed you
And gave you all my sugar
You knew that I'd be useless
If I let you know what you were to me
I thought it would be OK
We shared everything, No way

And I knew it, I knew that
You'd turn out to be a sad case
You said you could save me
I'm doing the saving
Went to sleep a superhero
And he woke up a villain
Killin' and killin' my love

Oh no, don't know what happened.
Don't know what happened

I keep trying and trying
To wrap my head around it
Crying so can't let nobody see how I'm acting
You hurt me, you hurt me
And no not physically
Ain't got no bumps and bruises
To show people what you're doing to me

I thought it would be OK

Using all my Kung Fu tricks, tricks
Hit 'em with the round house kick to the tempo
1, 2, 3, 4 hung hi ho, T.K.O, Tae Kwon Do
You know, When you see that hand go chop
Everything stops The flow so hot
Like steam from a coffee pot

Rush hour, no traffic
No Jet Li, just Jackie
You acting like you stay behind
Go read up on your classics
You ol' fake-o wanna be superman
Give Clark Kent back his glasses
Man I hit you with a judo kick so fast
You look back like what happened

Cherelle Fortier,"I know you're a gamester
I'm the queen of spades
A ruler of hearts, I shoot the moon
I take my trips right from the start

I'm a sucker for love
Joker running wild
My heart it can break
Ooh, it can break
Frail as a child

Whatever it is, it is
Whatever will be, it's gonna be
Whoever you are, you are
But those games that you play
Don't cha play 'em with me

You're a visionary dreamer
A fool, leaving things to chance
Love is a hazard, ooh, such a hazard
When you flirt with romance

It's like shootin' the dice
Flip a coin in the air
You running on luck
Odds are against you
You're not playing fair

Whatever it is, it is
Whatever will be, it's gonna be
Whoever you are, you are
But those games that you play
Don't cha play 'em with me

Stacking a deck, dealing the cards
Watch what you take
Standing on love

Whatever it is, it is
Whatever will be, it's gonna be
Whoever you are, you are
But those games that you play
Don't cha play 'em with me

Those games that you play
Don't cha play 'em with me

Hey , back on the scene
Ain't nuthin' changed

Whippin' something mean
The whole shorts in the Rolls Royce is off

When we hit the sick, I'm the cure
We 'bout to pop it off so wild, hit the floor
Ain't nobody botherin' you
All I'm thinkin' 'bout is clobberin' you
Immigration always sayin' I'm harboring a few
Illegal aliens
Females, mostly Latins and Israeli-ans

I'm the shit, they been deceiving you
Drop the roof on the Coupe D'Ville
Shoot to kill
Ask niggas, Duke is real
Stay lookin' for the loot to steal
He determined
Don't try to touch Bad Boy, cause we burnin'
I want my glory
Duke is not a joke, and I ain't gotta story
Every time I grab the mic it's with the sole intent
To rip shots and give you 2OO percent
Man, I'm tired of doin' dirt
Tired of being on the the run from Wyatt Earp
Rather be somewhere in a quiet church, sayin' prayers
Not only sayin' mine, but sayin' theirs
That's cause my dogs ain't there

Now would you clap your hands
Your hands you clap
If your girl's outta place then your girl get tapped
Niggas keep thinkin' Diddy ain't on it like that
But you never see me standing on the corner like that
Cause, I'm talented, yes I'm gifted
Never boosted, never shoplifted
Forget get the cash, the money ain't nothin'
Cause everything I talk about, you know I ain't fronting
I rock Sean John everyday
Boutiques from France to the USA
And I make all the chips off the hits I invent
So it really doesn't matter how much I spent
Cause, I'm droppin' hits
Daily
You burn me?
Really?

And I don't care if niggas write a billion rhymes

Girl, I got shit that your man ain't coppin'
You could hop in when your man ain't watchin'
Give you one option, temperature's droppin'
Gettin' cold, control your soul when I'm locked in
You the type of chick that fold when you boxed in
Signals my watch and givin' you more reasons to hop in
This is a Bentley, not a Datsun
Don't confuse me with dude, I'm not him
Your man got a lot to learn
But you could leave with the cat if you that concerned
One day you goin' actually learn
But not now cause, girl, I got tracks to burn

In this relationship so why (?)
You better know I'm not going to be 
Rearranging everything in my world
Not going to feel bad

I've been tryna figure out
What the fight is all about
I'm tired of playin' like we're in love again
I guess we should've thought it out
Cuz now theirs way too many doubts
Can't be going through this again (no no no no)

I can't imagine what I've
Done to you to make me feel
This way baby
I don't understand
Ain't nobody keepin' score
And it ain't about right or wrong
Who cares if you win the argument

I'm dropping out of love
I didn't sign up for this pain
So I'm out of love
I can't take feeling this way
Dropping out of love
I think it's best you go your way
Cause I've had enough of this hurting baby

[Verse 2]
Lately you've been buggin' out
All types of madness out your mouth
You think it's funny, well sweetie think again
I wanna see how hard you laugh
You turn around and I'm not there
No apologies, no baby please not again

I can't imagine what I've
Done to you to make me feel

I hear the clock tick and think of you
Caught up in circles
Confusion is nothing new
Flash back warm night, almost left behind
Suitcase of memories
Time after

Sometime you pictured me
I'm walking too far ahead
You're calling to me
I can't hear what you've said
Then you said, ""go slow, I fall behind""
The second hand unwinds

If you're lost you can look
And you will find me, time after time
If you fall I will catch you

And darkness has turned to grey

The drum beats out of time

And you will find me, time after time

Got the kinda face that would be loved in Hollywood
On my television I get news from Hollywood

Nor the fortune and the fame

There's nothing that we can't do

And defendin' what's true

We do what we got to

We ain't afraid to let the world know

We got the power to change what's wrong

As we're together

We're gonna stay strong

We do what have to


Ya know it ain't easy bein' a girl

'Cause so many people try to rule your world

They don't wanna give you the respect that you earned

It's like you gotta scream if you wanna be heard

But got to know within you lies

The power and strength to win the fight

And with your sisters by your side

There's nothing you can't survive


With the sugar, spice and everything nice

We got a little something

Extra

Holdin' us all together

We're takin' over

'Cause the world is a crazy place

And they you you're just a pretty face

So hold on to you no matter what they say

You can't just let them convince you to throw all your dreams away

And when you think you've had enough

Remember you've got the stuff

Inside that makes you twice as tough

And you're a diamond in the rough

So let all your superabilities show now

Let them all know that you just refuse to bow

'Cause there's no way anyone else can hold us down

We don't need no haters.
I need a down south G.
The ones that ride so good.
That can give me what I need. 
The ones that talk so hood.

My crip walkin' soldiers.
That can handle a chick like me.
A chick like me.

I want y'all to hear me clearly.
I'm not the picky type.
I like my thugs from every city.
GA, LA, on back to Philly.
But them dirty boys.
Oh they do something to me.
See I have to disagree.
I like my thugs from the NYC.
Steady trappin' on the gangsta scene.
Ridin' in cars up on that gangsta lean.

I'm a break it down and tell you how I like it.
Red monkey jeans hanging low with a black-T.
Gotta mean swag and he trappin' on the back street.
Now man it's somthing 'bout them G's.
Make Rasheeda temperature jump 100 degrees.
Is it the money or the candy paint dripping. 
Or the way he hold me down and keep it pimpin'.
Plus he know just how to beat it up.
Can't get enough so he always wanna eat it up.

That came from you

Really wish I could.

If only someone could un-break my heart
Come relieve my pain
Somehow I could wish upon a star
And make all of the memories go away,

But my mind just keeps on going back
And I can't help but think about
That guy that's gon' make me miss out on you
And I can't help but remember
'bout that sad day in September
That day he took my heart with him when he left.

See eventually I will get through this,
But right now it seems my heart's in the way.

Lights dimmed.
Candles lit.
Your car pulls up.
And then you walk in.
I can see the look on your face.
I know you 'bout to ruin my day.
Then you get to spittin' lines.
Something like this comes a time.
Blood rush to my head.
I start shaking.
Right now my heart is aching.

[Pre-Chorus]
(Thump, thump, thump)
That's when you said and my heart thumped to a thousand beats a second.
(Thump, thump, thump)
Gotta catch my breath.
(Ha, ha)
Cause there's nothing left.
(Thump, thump, thump)
All these years that I've been down.
How you gonna leave me now?
All that's left is regret.
Wish I never met you.
Can't believe I was a fool.

[Chorus]
You got my heart beating like a drum.
Tell me where did this come from?
Thinking that I'm a have your baby.
Now you're telling me something crazy.
What am I suppose to do?
How do I live without you?
Can't believe you're saying that we're done.
You got my heart beating like a drum.

Now I'm sitting here so confused.
Thinking 'bout what the hell I'm gone do.
How can I live without your love?
My body's yearning for you touch.
Thought you said I would be your wife.
Ride or die.
Me and you for life.
Forever you and I.
I was thinking, now our ship is sinking.

I still can't see how, how I couldn't see the signs.
And how I wasn't warned.
Why the only man I ever loved would break my heart?
Tell me where do I go from here?
And how do I move on?
You're the only thing I've known.
Baby, your house is my home.
How could I lose you?
I won't go.
I refuse to.
Cause I can't stop thinking 'bout you.
Dreaming 'bout you.
See, how could I ever live without you?

Oh, no, I don't want to hear it all though
Yeah, I know I'll still be missing you
And it's not worth the pain
That came from you
You made me feel

And a small cabin build there, of clay and wattles made.
Nine bean rows will I have there, and a hive for the honeybee,
And live alone in the bee-loud glade.

And I shall have some peace there, for peace comes dropping slow,
Dropping from the veils of morning to where the cricket sings;
The midnight’s all a glimmer, and noon a purple glow,
And evening full of the linnet’s wings.

I will arise and go now, for always night and day
I hear lake water lapping with low sounds by the shore;
While I stand on the roadway, or on the pavements gray,
I hear it in the deep heart’s core.

Cherish the Ladies,"An only child alone and wild, a cabinet maker's son
His hands were meant for different work
And his heart was known to none
He left his home and went his lone and solitary way
And he gave to me a gift I know I never can repay

A quiet man of music denied a simpler fate
He tried to be a soldier once, but his music wouldn't wait
He earned his love through discipline, a thundering velvet hand
His gentle means of sculpting souls took me years to understand

The leader of the band is tired and his eyes are growing old
But his blood runs through my instrument and his song is in my soul
My life has been a poor attempt to imitate the man
I'm just a living legacy to the leader of the band

My brother's lives were different for they heard another call
One went to Chicago and the other to St Paul
And I'm in Colorado when I'm not in some hotel
Living out this life I've chose and come to know so well

I thank you for the music and your stories of the road
I thank you for the freedom when it came my time to go
I thank you for the kindness and the times when you got tough
And papa, I don't think I said I love you near enough

But his blood runs through my instrument and his song is in my soul

And the small birds sang when wintertime was over
Then you'd pack your load and be on the road
They were good old times for the rover

Sometimes we'd meet up with other people
Hear the news or else swap family information
At the country fairs, we'd be meeting there

I made willow creels and the heather besom 
and I've even done some begging and some hawking
And I've lain there spent wrapped up in my tent 
and I've listened to the old folk talking

I'd fly right home to my false true lover

And all the love I felt for her it passed all understanding
Took her sailing on the river, flow sweet river flow
London town was mine to give her, sweet Thames flow softly
Made the Thames into a crown, flow sweet river flow
Made a brooch of Silver town, sweet Thames flow softly

At London Yard I held her hand, at Blackwell Point I faced her
At the Isle of Dogs I kissed her mouth and tenderly embraced her
Heard the bells of Greenwich ringing, flow sweet river flow
All the time my heart was singing, sweet Thames flow softly
Limehouse Reach I gave her there, flow sweet river flow
As a ribbon for her hair, sweet Thames flow softly

From Putney Bridge to Nine Elms Reach we cheek to cheek were dancing
A necklace made of London Bridge her beauty was enhancing
Kissed her once again at Wapping, flow sweet river flow
After that there was no stopping, sweet Thames flow softly
Gave her Hampton Court to twist, flow sweet river flow
Into a bracelet for her wrist, sweet Thames flow softly

But now, alas, the tide has changed, my love she has gone from me
And winter's frost has touched my heart and put a blight upon me
Creeping fog is on the river, flow sweet river flow
Sun and moon and stars gone with her, sweet Thames flow softly
Swift the Thames runs to the sea, flow sweet river flow
Bearing ships and part of me, sweet Thames flow softly",Sweet Thames Flow Softly,2005

With my tongue slowly sliding on you, warmth, waist/
Loving the way you makin’ that fuck face/
I’m working you out and you hella screaming, and I didn’t even try to/

And every time we alone/
Something takes control/

Underneath the Christmas tree
I just want you for my own

All I want for Christmas
Is you

You baby

I won't ask for much this Christmas
I won't even wish for snow
I'm just gonna keep on waiting
Underneath the mistletoe
I won't make a list and send it
To the North Pole for Saint Nick

I won't even stay awake to
Hear those magic reindeer click
'Cause I just want you here tonight
Holding on to me so tight
What more can I do
Baby all I want for Christmas is you
You

All the lights are shining
So brightly everywhere
And the sound of children's
Laughter fills the air
And everyone is singing
I hear those sleigh bells ringing
Santa won't you bring me the one I really need
Won't you please bring my baby to me

Oh I don't want a lot for Christmas
This is all I'm asking for
I just want to see my baby
Standing right outside my door
Oh I just want him for my own

Livin’ life coo, not buried in tears/
No enemies or foes tryna test my triggas/
Walkin’ down the street no pigs messin’ with us/

I’m fallin’ real hard baby, like it was a injury/

 You positive, you beautiful, you flawless baby/ 
It’s never bad whether when the sky’s never hazy/

Are we really spending time or is this really just a dream/

And no-one hears the stifled tears, I duly shed.
Just waiting on my boat to cross the blue,
Drinking for two.

But this love of mine is frozen in time, and so i'm stuck inside my dreams.

With time to kill, I will until, the morning creeps.

He hasn’t quite mastered tyin’ his tie on
The way his sweet Sarah used to

It’s been years since he’s talked to the good Lord
He’s not sure he even knows how
But he won’t be mowin’ the front yard today
He goes to church on Sundays now

No, he don’t know the words to ‘The Old Rugged Cross’
But he sings them the best that he can
‘Cause he knows that his angel is up there in Heaven
And he sure wants to see her again

For thirty-one years they were married
She never could get him to go
Now he’s up bright and early
There by 9:30 and sits on the very front row

And he bows his head with the members
And he shouts Amen good and loud
If only his Sarah could see him today
He goes to church on Sundays now

No, he don’t know the words to ‘The Old Rugged Cross’
But he sings them the best that he can
‘Cause he knows that his angel is up there in Heaven
And he sure wants to see her again

His kids can’t believe how he’s changin’
They tell him their mama’d be proud
And he’s always askin’ them all to go with him

But he sings them the best that he can

Your daddy met your mommy
Back when you were in her tummy
Since you haven't met your real father

Do things that make me happy
And if I don't approve of your attitude
I'll send your ass straight to your room
And make you change my name to Papi

Teach me things I never knew

You told me secrets that
You've never told a soul
You were so nervous and
Yet oh so comfortable
As we explored your image of love
I drank your wine
As you tasted mine
I kissed your lips
You felt my body slip
Into your soul
I heard you moan
I almost cried 'cause it was so beautiful
Last night
I was inside of you
Last night
While making love to you
I saw the sun, the moon
The mountains and the rivers
I saw heaven when I made sweet love to you
Last night, there was no planning it
It was so special and
So very innocent
We talked of memories
Our favorite fantasies
As we explored our visions of love
And deep into the night
Right by the fireside
You felt my candlelight
In you soul
You felt incredible
I started to explode
I almost cried 'cause it was so beautiful
Last night
I was inside of you
Last night
While making love to you
I saw the sun, the moon
The mountains and the rivers
I saw heaven when I made sweet love to you
Sunlight, red roses
The scent of you, it calms the heart
The sight of you, I fall apart
Moonlight, the things we notice
When we're in love, that's when it comes
And I'm so in love, I'm so in love
Last night

While making love to you

I hear the soft wind sighing 
In every bush and tree 
The sound of my heart crying 
When you are far from me 

When we're apart, my darlin' 
There's sorrow in the wind 
When we're apart, my darlin 
Sweet sorrow in the wind 

You leave me in the morning 
Your footsteps die away 
Tho' not a leaf is stirring 
I hear the wind all day 

When we're apart, my darlin' 
There's sorrow in the wind 
When we're apart, my darlin' 
Sweet sorrow in the wind 

They say when love grows older 
It dies and fades away 
Yet all our life together 
One ever brightening day 

When we're apart, my darlin' 
There's sorrow in the wind 
When we're apart, my darlin' 
Sweet sorrow in the wind

Silk stockings thrown aside dance invitations

Wild strawb'ries only seven francs a kilo

The song that Crosby sings

I fixed him his drink as usual

Cheryl Cole,"I've been holding out for some silver in the clouds
It just gets dark, it just gets hard to see
Well you told me go for broke
You go first, I'll hold the rope
And make your way down to solid ground with me

You are the universe
You see it 'til you feel it hurt
Only energy
Stressing over what we're worth
It's only love
It's only dust
Making up the two of us
And we all fall down
You're only human
You're only human

When your words stuck in your throat
Find a love through a telescope
Yeah the view below
It gives me vertigo
So just keep your fingers crossed
Sign your love, can't sing your lost
Until you love so loud, if you listen you,
You hear it shout

You are the universe
You see it 'til you feel it hurt
It's only energy
Stressing over what we're worth
It's only love
It's only dust
Making up the two of us
And we all fall down
You're only human
You're only human

I get out of the boxes I'm living in
I get out of this sin that I'm swimming in
Break it down, spit it out
Won't drown, won't track me down
I get out of the boxes I'm living in
I get out of this sin that I'm swimming in
Break it down, spit it out
Don't burn it, the color burst

You are the universe
You see it 'til you feel it hurt
It's only energy
Stressing over what we're worth

Pretty things in the air out there

Humming birds around my head

I got tiny little bee stings on my heart

Honey can I only be with you?
Sitting underneath the shade 
Tree in the park where I first met you
Funny how the light can change your view

Oh

Humming birds around my head
Humming birds around my head
I ran into your arms

Heard they crowded the floor

Than to stow away on a plane, some day and have them
Drop me off in Harlem.

Now he's a honcho
He's a hero
Here was a kid with his act down pat
From zero to hero in no time flat
Zero to hero just like that 

When he smiled the girls went wild with oohs and aahs
And they slapped his face on every vase (on every vahse)

Our Herc had cash to burn
Now nouveau riche and famous
He could tell you what's a Grecian earn

Sweet and undefeated and an awesome ten for ten
Folks lined up just to watch him flex
And this perfect package packed a pair of pretty pecs

You and I said goodbye
Whispering that we would be returning
When autumn comes again

Now autumn roams the hills once more
But you forgot your vow
Now here am I with, alone with only memories
Only lonely memories, autumn memories of you

I get a hungry yearning for your arms
Love, when a heart is so blue
It shadows bright October's golden charm

The night of love that we once knew
Each tiny star is but a prayer
That when it's fall again, love will call again
And you'll be beside me to make

For a sign, a light in the sky,
Oh the message is clear, that the time is near,
For a leader to come again;

A circle of stones on the head of a hill,
Tonight is where it will be,
In this desolate place, we all stand and wait,
For a leader to come again, yes a leader will come again;

And it started right in front of my eyes",Leader (The Jesus Peace),2009

I'll go my way by myself, this is the end of romance. 
I'll go my way by myself, love is only a dance. 
I'll try to apply myself and teach my heart to sing. 
I'll go my way by myself like a bird on the wing,
I'll face the unknown, I'll build a world of my own; 
No one knows better than I, myself, I'm by myself alone.
I'll go my way by myself, here's how the comedy ends. 
I'll have to deny myself love and laughter and friends.
Grey clouds in sky above have put a blot on my fun.

Whadda they do when there is no starry sky?
Where do they go when they can't go for a walk?
Do they sit at home and talk,
Or do they sit and sigh, ""Aye Aye!""?

Where do they woo on a rainy night in Rio?
How can a guy meet a sweetheart by the sea?
Maybe the girl wants a tender kiss, and yet,
How tender can you get
When you're beneath a wet palm tree?

Whadda they do in Mississippi
When skies are drippy?
And whadda they do when it's murky
In Alberquerque?
And whadda they do in Old Arkoona
When the moon above ain't bright?
Well, that's what they do in Rio
On a rainy night!

But whadda they do when skies are dreary
Along Lake erie?
And whadda they do in St Louis
When nights are dewy?
And whadda they do in Colorado

Everytime I look around, I see
So much drama goin down
Everytime I look around, I see
So much fakeness goin down

[stic.man]
Why I'ma- be stingy when I could share?
Why I'ma- be hateful if I could care?
Why would I hate my own?
Or forsake my own?
Why would I- fuck around and get a jake on my chrome?
I wouldn't- have to stick you if we all could eat
It wouldn't be no need for beef
Dyin over streets we don't even own anyway
You could get bucked off anyday
We behind enemy lines
y'all still writin Hennessy rhymes
While I'm tryna find a good price for a nine
Feel like my life on the line
That's why a nigga be hype all the time
Ready for the revolution at the drop a'a dime

[m1]
I got a duty to have security for my niggas
My duty to serve the beautiful black sistas
A duty to stand wit' anybody that's wit' us
And fully criticize all bullshittas
There should be awards presented- to niggas who fight back
Like Panther jackets, or sistas who light gats
I'm a full-blooded warrior, ready for change
Recognize any soldier that's doin the same
Because I love who I am, and that means everything to me
My life ain't worth a damn unless I'm dealin with reality
When I look myself in the eyes, it's just me
And I don't have to tell nobody no lies, I feel free
And I would rather deal with the truth and falsehood
Than bein fake with my people and claimin 'it's all good'
You can't run away from ya self, so that's useless
If your word is bond, then you don't have to make excuses

Everytime I look around, I see
So much drama goin down

Never had a dime 
My life a crime 
Had be when I was nine 
Mom drunk off of wine 
Ran with all kind her mind stayed wit the stooper 
Till a point she paid no mind to the supper 
Stay mad but stay fronting with smiles 
Stayed on the groung once and a while 
First day of school 
Never had nutin to style 
Mister colondre stressin I ain't comin in a while 
It was a bummber 
Rocking the shit I rocked all summer 
On the first day I was feeling some kind of way 
And she wasn't trying to do nutin 
You would think for the sake of the kids she would enroll in school or 
Something 
Now I kno then was even harder 
Especially for a single mother 
Raising me with no father 
Shit living up in this tentament 
Eating stale m and m's 
Talking wild shit to spanish imigrants 
I speak in codes 
Man to sivrence 
Always quiet then ben dichon to my madre 
Even thought she did nutin for me 
Acknowledge me as I run down my life story 

You don't know how crazy it is outside 
I die inside 
Oh I've cried oh I've cried 
Do you forgive me?? do you forgive me?? 

Check the skit 
No body never gave me shit 
If anything a nigga frame me and make me get 
3 to 6 my first bid 
No doubt up in sparfard 
Had to be 12 son had to make a profit 
Remembering robbed my moms wit no guilt 
Eating pork and beans or corn flakes wit no milk 
In school I smacked cats in a hurry 
Moms didn't care she was getting drunk wit misses berray 
On the first floor 
I used to thrist for greenary 
Picking pockets wit seth and jay from hundred and sixth street 
Yo fuck home 
I'm tired of geting punched in my dome 
Tired of this faggot ass nigga moan 
That's when I started roaming 
My hustling game is deep 
Cats ya heard 
Ran from san fran to manhat tan to newburg 
Notorious tell ya friends spread the word 
Glorious my life story is obsurd

I'm gonna keep it real still a scheme man coniver 

Recognize the struggle live it like a thug do 

Hatred in my heart but inside I love you 

See no matter what I will extend my arms to hug you 

Knowing I am just like you, I am like the double 

All I want to kno is how you pound me down 

Yo this shit is real and you really jerked me around 

But any way I am geting paid wit puff now 

I can cop you a house I can send you some stuff now 

So many levels jail take you 

I appreciate jail because it made me appreciate you 

I've been through fire and birth stone 

Used to be ???? not I cop the gem stone

While mothers weep
And saviors were fast asleep

I wait for them to read your looks
While drinking from my broken cup
And ask me to open up the gate for you

Just a slave like one of us?
Just a stranger on the bus

And would you want to see it
If seeing meant that you would have to believe in things like heaven
And Jesus and the saints and all the prophets?

That why I talk on my records, that be why I talk on my records
Be like cause I got something to say
And on this song right here I got something to say
About them real women out there, you know what I'm saying?
Ya heard me?

[Chorus]
Holla at me any time you need me
When you hear this song bump on the radio
I, know you be happy cause we made it past it
If you need something just ask daddy, come on
When sunshine turns to rain
You stuck with me through all the pain - that's why I love you
Trust me, you ain't got to want for nothing
If you ever need me - just holla at ya kinfolk

Kinfolk, look
Kinfolk she came down South with me, suffered through the drought with me
Lived out of car, still didn't have no doubt in me
She went without with me, lost everything she had (that she did)

To get me back on my feet she borrowed from her mom and dad
She wore the same clothes, even rocked the same shoes (same shoes)
She sold her earrings man to get ya boy back in the booth
She sold my mixtapes to help me get our s*** straight

My gal trill and for me she'll do whatever it takes
She took a charge for me when I got caught with a gun and Hydro
At TSU homecoming at the ma** co (cash real)
She on the grind with Shine, trying to come up on these figures

I'm a keep it trill man, she realer than most of y'all n****z
Taught her stay down (down) and you'll come up (up)
That's how we live everyday where I'm from bra
And man it's what she did (did) she know who she is (she know)
Anything I got I'm a give her, holla at ya kinfolk

Kinfolk, kinfolk!
See you my inspiration; on top of that my motivation
I know you got my back, regardless of the situation
Girls don't even know you hate you, I know they get so aggravating

Yet you got so much patience dealing with me and this dream I'm chasing
I'm constantly on the road (road) I'm constantly on the move (move)
You calmly handle the duties, things you thought you'd never do (do)
Like living out hotels and messing up your credit (credit)

It would of broke a weaker gal but you ain't let it (ain't let it)
Get the best of ya that's why I mess with you
Went through God's test with you, why I'm so blessed with you
I must confess to you when I say that you the trillest (trillest)

Compared to any other gal yeah you the realest (the realest)
And man you got to feel it, just like my heart's feeling
Through this track when I be talking about this hard living
It's like you was my witness (witness) now you is my Mrs.
Anything you want you can get it, holla at ya kinfolk

Who too hard to say how he feel, know what I'm saying?

Be what I wanna be (be what I wanna be) 
If I work hard at it (If I work hard it)
I'll be where I wanna be (I'll be where I wanna be)

Be, B-Boys and girls, listen up 
You can be anything in the world, in God we trust
An architect, doctor, maybe an actress 
But nothing comes easy it takes much practice
Like, I met a woman who's becoming a star
She was very beautiful, leaving people in awe
Singing songs, Lina Horn, but the younger version
Hung with the wrong person
Gotta astrung when I heard when 
Cocaine, sniffing up drugs, all in her nose
Coulda died, so young, no looks ugly and old
No fun cause when she reaches for hugs people hold they breath
Cause she smells of corrosion and death 
Watch the company you keep and the crowd you bring
Cause they came to do drugs and you came to sing
So if you gonna be the best, I'ma tell you how

I know I can (I know I can)

Be, B-Boys and girls, listen again
This is for grown looking girls who's only ten
The ones who watch videos and do what they see
As cute as can be, up in the club with fake ID
Careful, 'fore you meet a man with HIV
You can host the TV like Oprah Winfrey 
Whatever you decide, be careful, some men be
Rapists, so act your age, don't pretend to be 
Older than you are, give yourself time to grow
You thinking he can give you wealth, but so
Young boys, you can use a lot of help, you know
You thinkin life's all about smokin weed and ice
You don't wanna be my age and can't read and right
Begging different women for a place to sleep at night
Smart boys turn to men and do whatever they wish
If you believe you can achieve, then say it like this

I know I can (I know I can) 
Be what I wanna be (be what I wanna be) 
If I work hard at it (If I work hard it)
I'll be where I wanna be (I'll be where I wanna be)

I know I can (I know I can) 
Be what I wanna be (be what I wanna be) 
If I work hard at it (If I work hard it)
I'll be where I wanna be (I'll be where I wanna be)

Be, be, 'fore we came to this country 
We were kings and queens, never porch monkeys
It was empires in Africa called Kush 
Timbuktu, where every race came to get books
To learn from black teachers who taught Greeks and Romans
Asian Arabs and gave them gold when 
Gold was converted to money it all changed 
Money then became empowerment for Europeans
The Persian military invaded 
They learned about the gold, the teachings and everything sacred
Africa was almost robbed naked
Slavery was money, so they began making slave ships 
Egypt was the place that Alexander the Great went 
He was so shocked at the mountains with black faces
Shot up they nose to impose what basically 
Still goes on today, you see? 
If the truth is told, the youth can grow 
They learn to survive until they gain control 
Nobody says you have to be gangstas, hoes
Read more learn more, change the globe
Ghetto children, do your thing
Hold your head up, little man, you're a king
Young Prince that's when you get your wedding ring
Your man is saying ""She's my queen""

I know I can (I know I can) 
Be what I wanna be (be what I wanna be) 
If I work hard at it (If I work hard it)
I'll be where I wanna be (I'll be where I wanna be)

She wants to grab her telephone but she knows it ain't right
So if he won't call she'll survive
And if he don't care she'll get by
Climb into bed bury her head and cry, cry
From the beginning he was all anyone could been
They were delirious with love, they were certain to win
Now he's breaking plans more and more
And he's leaving notes on her door
'took a trip out of town, couldn't turn this one down'
He said 'I guess I should have told you before'

[Chorus]
She says she feels like she's addicted to a real bad thing
She's always sitting, waiting wondering if the phone will ring
She knows she bounces like a yo-yo when he pulls her string
It hurts to feel like such a fool
She wants to tell him not to call or come around again
He doesn't need her now at all the way that she needs him
She's on the edge about to fall from leaning out and in
And she don't know which way to move

She wants to be fair, she couldn't say he was ever unkind
But if she could bear to walk away, she thinks he wouldn't mind
'cause he just keeps himself so apart
And there's no one else in her heart
So she's taking a dive from an emotional high
And coming down hard

She's determined to try, but she'll still give in when he gives her a call
And She'll ask herself why, but in the end it won't matter at all
Sure she could sit at home, stay inside
And sleep alone with her pride
And as she walks out her door, she feels as weak as before
With nothing to hide

Weren't we something way back when
Didn't we wonder how would we come here
Trading our dreams so they'd never end
All those sweet dark nights where the warm air sings
We could close our eyes stretching still folded wings
Waiting for the rain to cool us
Feeling like a couple of foolish young things

Weren't they good times didn't our hearts bind
Didn't we both find something new
Fleeting impressions, timid expressions
Tossed in the tangle of me and you
And if I close my eyes, I can almost see
Moving through those green fields where we used to be
The shadow of a different daydream
Holding in the distance and waiting to breathe

Dusty roads, starry skies
Beating hearts, reluctant eyes, summer rain without a storm
And nervous love behind the barn",Behind the Barn,1986

I can't stop the flow 'til you've decided to

Song runs like a piper, like a drummer through my brain
The silence all around feels so apart from me
I could sit and cry for all the love and all the pain
That brings itself to mind inside a harmony

The softest mornin' light can't shine as soft as you
The sweetest love in sight can't love me like you do
Swiftest bird in flight can't climb the path to you

And now, it's fully dawn and nightly silence breaks away
Into the distant sounds of cars and factories
Traces linger on and slowly fade into the day
And leave me with these rounds all hummin' back to me

So now, I bid you well, take myself to bed
The tune you had to tell was soft and kindly said
I still feel the swell from all you comforted

We'll visit friends and sites along the way
So bring the bikes and toys and diapers
Pay the neighbor's son
And call to stop the mail and, honey,
Don't forget the guns

(Chorus)
Now don't forget the guns you know exactly what I mean
Bring the pistols, bring the uzi and the old are-15
We don't look for trouble but by golly if we're in it
It's nice to know we're free to blow nine hundred rounds a minute

We'll head for Chicago, stop for the night
Hope for good weather hope the kids don't fight
They've never seen mt. Rushmore and they ought to understand
The kind of men who forged our freedom all across this land

We'll hike up a trail and ride down a street
Stand by Old Faithful and watch her blow off steam
When we pack picnic lunches that's not all we'll bring along
'Cause we'll be packing 45's case anything goes wrong

(Repeat Chorus)

Oh riding along we'll follow the sights
Over the mountains under the pines
Up to boot hill where they got what they gave
In the land of the free you've got to be brave

Cheryl Wheeler,"I remember when George used to come to our house
For a meeting of one of his clubs
He would often drive down
'Cause we lived close to town
Where the pulse of the big business was

He belonged to the yacht club, the truckers, the shriners
Though he had no boat and no rig
Still he'd eat roast beef dinners
And hob-nob with winners
And wait till he hit something big

But before he could get that big fish on the line
They let everyone in and ruined the Shrine
And he was easily riled and likely to shout
Frequently wrong but never in doubt

His friends called him skippy
But he had no family
Till my mother's folks took him in
Just a short blond and wavy
Boy from the navy
And he never left home again

How he married Agnes oh I'll never know
She was gracious and gentle
And she loved him so
And he was grand in her eyes
When they would go out
And frequently wrong but never in doubt

And I guess he had a big time
Sharing the secret symbol
With masters elect of the night
Down at the Boumi temple

Well I guess he was crazy
I think he was lonely
My mother was his best friend
He hollered and cried
The day that she died
And I rarely saw him again

And I guess I've forgotten since I was a kid
I don't know why we loved him I just know we did
And he was easily riled, likely to shout
Frequently wrong but never in doubt",Frequently Wrong But Never in Doubt,1993
Cheryl Wheeler,"SPRING

In a broken down apartment house
Laid a woman in labor
She said by the grace of God
I'll have this child
And the help of a neighbor
Six o'clock the sun was rising
All upon the world
Seven forty-five the neighbor smiled
And said you got a beautiful girl
She named her Spring
Winter's been a long time passing
She named her Spring
And though she's never been wed
She held her newborn child and said
Ah Spring
I've waited a long long time for you
In a broken down apartment house
Lay a woman dying
By her side a little six year old girl
Who was softly crying
Momma don't go away
And leave me all alone
Momma said to the welfare lady
Find my child a good home
I miss my Spring
Ah winter's been a long time passing
I miss you Spring
The angels came that day
The welfare lady knelt to pray
Ah Spring
She'll be long time gone from you
A beautiful church outside of town
Stands a woman smiling
On her hand is a wedding band
Of fashionable styling
All these years in the orphan's home
He shares with you
Now all your hopes and your childhood dreams
Have all come true
He loves you Spring
Winter's been a long time passing
He needs you Spring
He promised you today
He would never never go away
Ah Spring
He's waited a long long time for you
Long long time for you

Cheryl Wheeler,"In the year of the yellow cab
Shadow of the great world war
The third kid grandmom had
Came into this world
On a rolling farm in Maryland
When Wilson was the president
As summer blew her goodbye through the trees

A child of changing times
Growing up between the wars
Fords rolled off the lines
And bars all closed their doors
and I imagine you back then
With snap brim hat and farmer's tan
Where horses drew their wagons through the fields

Now the fields are all four lanes
and the moon's not just a name
Are you more amazed at how things change
Or how they stay the same
And do you sit here on this porch and wonder
How the time flies by
Or does it seem to barely creep along
With 75 Septembers come and gone

Were the fields all gold and fawn
Was the spring house dark and cool
Did the rooster crow at dawn
When they got you up for school
And would you tell me once again
The tales of granddad's hired men
And how they drove the old dirt road to town

Cause now the fields are all four lanes
And the moon's not just a name
Are you more amazed at how things change
Or how they stay the same
And do you sit here on this porch and wonder
How the times flies by
Or does it seem to barely creep along

Tell me baby does the future look black
Can we still look forward if we can't go back
Am I holdin' you up, holdin' you down
Making you feel there's no way out

I see your face, I see my part
I walked away
And broke your heart
And you're marking your time
And hearing some call
And you can't find no peace at all

Can't move back

Deep nights and quiet days
Long lovers, old comforts
Feel like some ball and chain

I guess we're really gettin' old
Always worrying we're wasting our time
Wantin' somethin' new to hold
Some affair would be the perfect crime

Long roads crumble
Forevers fall apart
One day we don't know
Why we're so far from

One love that's all of it
Deep nights and quiet days
Long lovers, old comforts
Feel like some ball and chain

And if I want you and you want me
We'll call it love though it might not be
Hearts on fire, souls in line
Oh, just to know that, just to feel that one more time

Seems impossible to know
What is real and what is just some restless thing
And our hearts learn slow
All the miseries bad choices bring

So is it wise or lazy
Holding tight to what you've known
And is it brave or crazy searching for some

Didn't we both intend

By the river side
Richard thompson on
And the day so fine
Pennsylvania towns
Sort of slip right by
In a soft line south
Under purple skies

Through the sunday bells
Through the trailer towns
Through the rolling hills
From behind some cloud
The sun still shines
And the streams run down
The mountain sides

Slow down what's the hurry

There won't be too many

I don't mind telling you it's what I do

Now I'm down and dropping still
And this snow's blowing through
Like some ghost
With this blue I know too well

Broken hearts keep on beating just the same
So I guess I can too
Go through these moves
Facing forward, walking straight

But now my glance keeps drifting downward
Now my feet can't find their way
And this cold's creeping in
Through my bones
Whisperin it's here to stay

I'll bide my time, like there's any other way
It moves too slow, moves too fast

And stopped entirely today

I should certainly be doing something else
And it's selfish to be thinking I'm unworthy
All this me, me, me, me, self, self, self, self, self

If I'm talking on the phone I should be working on the lawn
Which looks disgraceful from the things I haven't done
If I'm working on the lawn I should be concentrating on
Those magazines inside, since I have not read one

I should learn how to meditate and sow and bake
And dance and paint and sail and make gazpacho
I should turn my attention to repairing
All those forty year old socks there in that bureau

I should let someone teach me to run Windows
And learn French that I can read and write and speak
I should get life in prison for how I treated my parents
From third grade until last week

And I should spend more time playing with my dog
And much less money on this needless junk I buy
And I should send correspondence back to everyone
Who's written, phoned or faxed since junior high

I should sit with a therapist until I understand
The way I felt back in my [Incomprehensible]
I should quit smoking, drinking, eating, thinking
Sleeping, watching TV, writing stupid songs

And I should be less impatient when the line just takes forever
'Cause the two cashiers are talking
And I should see what it's like to get up really early rain or shine
And spend three hours walking

I should know CPR and deep massage and Braille
And sign language and how to change my oil
I should go where the situation's desperate
And build and paint and trudge and tote and toil

And I should chant in impossible positions
Till my legs appear to not have any bones
And I should rant at the cops and politicians
And the corporations in indignant tones

And I should save lots of money to leave Audubon
Plus all the rocks and animals and plants
I should brave possibilities for plotting plums of problems
Prob'ly blossomed, plausibly from

Sure I miss you, but I've been really movin', really turnin' away
But just when I thought the heartache was gone
It's tapping me on the shoulder
Saying who are you foolin'?
Some things you just don't get over

I could write you a letter, and I always do in my head
Just to tell you I'm better and this lonely didn't kill me I guess
But just when I know I've finally let go
I dream you are so much closer
Oh who am I foolin?
Some things you just don't get over

I'm wearin' a new face, a little insane
And here in the old place nothin's the same

I'm waiting for winter, it always seems warmer somehow
It's the sun on the snowfall and the silence I am longing for now

Now she works this desk at night and the campground by day
in a trailer by the lake until the summer blows away

She read about the job in a camping magazine
and home was just a reminder
So she took the cat and dog, stored away her things,
left the bleakness behind her

she's filled with wonder and far from giving in
She sees magic on the lake in the early morning light

And since you’ve been gone I’m just fallin’ apart 
There’s a hole in my life, in my soul, in my heart 
And I stare out this window till light becomes dark 
And there’s nothing that’s touching me now 

But not to complain, we’re just bereft, not deserted 
Lord knows you’re rest was deserved 
It’s just your absence is present in all that I do 
In the sun in the field, in the poem I keep saying 
In the hymn that some church bells were playing 
You have always been part of them but I never knew 

How could I ever begin to say? 
Surely you already knew 
What is this world with you gone away? 
How can this finally be true?",Since You've Been Gone,2005
Cheryl Wheeler,"Summer's almost over and I'm crying but I don't know why
Sentimental old fool, weeping for this blue, blue sky
And the way the cat is sleeping and the way the garden grew
Wagging dogs who lick my face and the way I feel for you

Paddling in the kayaks, with my sister, through the quiet creek
Moon upon the water and the river breeze upon my cheek
And the way my father shuffles with his courage and his cane
And the way September bluffs and feints till autumn falls again
Oh summer's almost over and I'm crying but I don't know why

A party for my birthday and a tractor for my 50 years
Swallows at their bird play spin and dive above the new mown fields
And a week in Colorado reading books with my best friend
And the thing I knew I couldn't do and now I know I can

Who could help but welcome autumn and the promise of the winter snow?
Still there's something sweet and wistful as I watch this lovely summer go
But the sun is sinking sooner and the weeds have won at last
With the berries on the bushes and the crickets in the grass
Oh summer's almost over and I'm crying but I don't know why",Summer's Almost Over,2005
Cheryl Wheeler,"Somedays, I can tell
You are holding back the river with a broken dam
And sometimes, do you feel
Like you're riding with the wrong reins in your hand?
Don't tell yourself you have used up all your chances
This is me talkin' now
This is me who loves you still
And you know I always will
 
Some things never change
You were always just the one I couldn't live without
I can't turn some page
And pretend it's all undone and I don't love you now
You close your eyes, and remember what I told you
This is me talkin' now
This is me who loves you still
And you know I always will

That remind me of what used to be
My aching heart tells me they are here to stay
Since you made a memory of me

I tossed and I turned night after night
Those memories just won't let me sleep
The flame in my heart is still burning bright
Though you made a memory of me

I passed by the house we once loved in
For a glimpse of what I thought was our dream
But these days I find the dream was all mine
Cause you made a memory of me

Cheryl White,"Oh, the people would come from far away,
To dance all night to the break of day.
When the caller would holler: ""Do Si Do"",
They knew Uncle Pen was ready to go.
Late in the evening, about sundown,
High on the hill, an' above the town,
Uncle Pen played the fiddle, Lord, how it rang,
You could hear it talk, you could hear it sing!

Well, he played an old tune they called the ""Soldier's Joy"",
And he played the one they called the ""Boston Boy"".
Greatest of all was the ""Jennie Lynn"",
To me, that's where the fiddlin' begins.

Late in the evening, about sundown,
High on the hill, an' above the town,
Uncle Pen played the fiddle, Lord, how it rang,
You could hear it talk, you could hear it sing

I'll never forget that mournful day
When old Uncle Pen was called away,
He hung up his fiddle and he hung up his bow,
And he knew it was time for him to go.

I hear the soft wind sighing 
In every bush and tree 
The sound of my heart crying 
When you are far from me 

When we're apart, my darlin' 
There's sorrow in the wind 
When we're apart, my darlin 
Sweet sorrow in the wind 

You leave me in the morning 
Your footsteps die away 
Tho' not a leaf is stirring 
I hear the wind all day 

When we're apart, my darlin' 
There's sorrow in the wind 
When we're apart, my darlin' 
Sweet sorrow in the wind 

They say when love grows older 
It dies and fades away 
Yet all our life together 
One ever brightening day

There's sorrow in the wind 
When we're apart, my darlin'

Or this place!

One night in Bangkok and the world's your oyster
The bars are temples but the pearls ain't free
You'll find a god in every golden cloister
And if you're lucky then the god's a she
I can feel an angel sliding up to me

One town's very like another
When your head's down over your pieces, brother

It's a drag, it's a bore, it's really such a pity
To be looking at the board, not looking at the city

Whaddya mean? Ya seen one crowded, polluted, stinking town 

Tea, girls, warm, sweet
Some are set up in the Somerset Maugham suite

Get Thai'd! You're talking to a tourist
Whose every move's among the purest
I get my kicks above the waistline, sunshine

One night in Bangkok makes a hard man humble
Not much between despair and ecstasy
One night in Bangkok and the tough guys tumble
Can't be too careful with your company
I can feel the devil walking next to me

Siam's gonna be the witness
To the ultimate test of cerebral fitness
This grips me more than would a
Muddy old river or reclining Buddha

And thank God I'm only watching the game, controlling it 

I don't see you guys rating
The kind of mate I'm contemplating
I'd let you watch, I would invite you
But the queens we use would not excite you

So you better go back to your bars, your temples, your massage
Parlors 

One night in Bangkok and the world's your oyster
The bars are temples but the pearls ain't free
You'll find a god in every golden cloister
A little flesh, a little history
I can feel an angel sliding up to me

One night in Bangkok makes a hard man humble
Not much between despair and ecstasy
One night in Bangkok and the tough guys tumble

Chest Rockwell,"Now come over here and let me give you a tongue kiss on your hot pocket

Me and Mike will go Twin Hype and do a dance on your windpipes
Put your fucking jazz hands back in your pants and get them shits sliced
Caught the ghost when I was yay high, so today I stay way high
Do not worry about my habits, without sin I'd probably hate life

This is dope as that hard white you stuff in a crack pipe
A hit of this, a kid with Tourrets will chill out and act right
I'm fat but I dress nice and bitches finesse Mike
They suck the dick and squeeze on my belly like bagpipes

I slap and I suck clits, I fuck in my church shoes
Humblest guy in the room and I am in the room too (Get it?)
I'll bend you over on the roof while whistling Audio Two
They say that once a girl go Brooklyn no more soft dick will do

I'm so Rakim and Eric B
Bitches check out my melody
I might Slick Rick on a fella (Foul), catch me a felony
Ay, I might Shyne Po a ho, pow! Catch me a case
Producto must have rolled this L because this blunt feel laced

I must say you do look stunning
I mean, you're the kind of girl I can really see myself artificially inseminating
Oh I'm sorry, I'm being a little aggressive, right?
Can we start from the beginning? My name is Chest Rockwell, right?
And I love to make love to your booty hole
Bad boy

This is born alone die alone, so my dialogue's dastardly
Life's a tragedy generator operating at max capacity
This is porno for piraters, to the crooks it is relaxing
I am foreign to that soft talk, you can tell it from my accent

This is arrogant fat black, it is what it is
This that stingy with dick, bitch, not a fuck do I give
I'm no respecter of person, I'm no respecter of rules
I catch the prince of England slipping, he goin' run me the jewels
I could wake up brain dead tomorrow and my soliloquy still will be
The illest there ever be, 'cause I be what you'll never be
My pugnacious rhyme patterns prove pitbull in my pedigree
And dogs fight to the death, you say you better, you better be

Not one shit given, El-P's chillin'
Raised in a shack in the back of the village
Trained by the wolves in the woods
To avenge on the men who elected themselves my killers
Mike's a villain, Nick Hooks chillin'
We don't have a need to know your feelings
We don't believe in the same shit anyway, Run the Jewels is not for your children

How you feeling now sweetheart? A little more relaxed?
Maybe it's that half a molly I put in your Mountain Dew
Yeah, works like a charm
Just chill out for a second, relax, relax, I got it under control
I got you a glass of Beefeater, I got a brand new deck of Uno cards
Oh yeah baby, the night's just getting started
Okay, how about I come over tonight and pick you up in my brand new Segway
We can go over to Long John Silver's, get a fish platter
You can take me home and massage me with butter all on my neck
I love you",Twin Hype Back,2013

Chester,"It was in those wonder-lust years, after I'd just left school,
That I first started to notice the change in everything.
I realised that the people I'd known all my life, (Take a long hard look,)
My family and friends were all just like strange little islands. (around the world you've helped to build.)
I didn't know who they were any more than I knew myself. (A Techni-colour wide-screen hell,)
It was at this point that I just started to drift. (beyond your window sill.)
A small balloon escaping from a child's hand. (Get over it, I'm only just getting my stride.)

Dig a hole for a broken man,
A man who could not cry,
Always a slave in a vacuous age,
Much passed him by.

I withdrew from all social activity quite dramatically,
Never seeing anybody unless I absolutely had to.
For the first 8 and a half months, (God-forsaken,)
I saw no-one except the guy who worked in the all-night petrol station. (belly-aching,)
And that suited me just fine. (low-life parasite.)
I dreamt of never having to go outside for any reason again, ever. (So much angry cynicism,)
Of being buried in my house with all my stuff, (so much angst and spite.)
Like a huge asbestos sarcophagus. (Get over it, I'm only just getting my stride.)

Dig a hole for a broken man,
A man who could not cry,
Always a slave in a vacuous age,
Much passed him by.

And I know what you're thinking,
'This guy needs to get out a bit more. Make contact.'
But that's not it. You see,
Since I've been away from other people,
Lots of things have improved in my life.
I'm a much better individual, thank you.
And now I've almost forgotten all the little things that used to bug me.
My appetites are healthy, and my mood is calm and even.

I said we gotta slow down

Let me take you back to high school, '94
Well, at least when a **** had time to go
Walk to the bus stop, sellin' **** on the way
Lil' bad **** with a pocket full of ****

Fell in love with a shorty that was bad
I would go and skip class just so I could see that ****
But she was too fast and I was too slow
'Cause she wanted a **** who already had dough

She found her a man who was like 24
But what she didn't know, that he had plenty ****
She was too young, so now he got a new one
'Cause shorty went and bought her a new ****

See when she catch this ****, she gon' do somethin'
Not fight, but shorty gon' **** somethin'
But she never got a chance, a change of plans
**** herself in the back, puttin' the **** in her pants

Live life young, ****, quit tryin' to be grown
You gon' miss momma when she dead and gone
Slow your roll, slow it down, my ****
Slow your roll, slow down, my ****

Live life, lil' mama, quit tryin' to be grown
You gon' miss daddy when he dead and gone
Slow your roll, c'mon, gotta slow down
Slow your roll, think you gotta slow down

I got a graveyard tatted on my arm
So I'ma just start with my uncle William Hahn
My momma only brother, he served in the navy
He lost his life because the war made him crazy

My nephew Shannen, 15 years old
When I think how he died, I get real cold
'Cause they found him in a field with some crack stones
There was no flesh, it was just bones

I was just home with my cousin Craig
And then I got a phone call, said they found him dead
So what's next, ain't went to Bizz funeral yet
Instead of one casket, I need two of them ****

It don't quit, just when you think I'm seein' better days
My auntie just find that she got AIDS
And it's **** up 'cause her life don't end
And she locked up, so she dyin' in the pen, ****

Live life young, ****, quit tryin' to be grown
You gon' miss momma when she dead and gone
Slow your roll, slow it down, my ****
Slow your roll, slow down, my ****

Live life, lil' mama, quit tryin' to be grown
You gon' miss daddy when he dead and gone
Slow your roll, c'mon, gotta slow down
Slow your roll, think you gotta slow down

This can't be life we're living
'Cause I don't wanna live no more
I don't wanna live no more
(This can't be life we're living)
'Cause I don't wanna live no more
I don't wanna live no more

This can't be life we're living
'Cause I don't want it no more, no more
This can't be life we're living

",Pour Out Your Holy Spirit,2001
Chester French,"Take me as I em my friends, ain't gon' change,
Wont be no Em, rock these songs,
Rock these shows, only good life I know

I was in seventh grade when I heard the Slim Shady LP,
Ya my mom brought it down when I was ironing, irony,
Getting out the wrinkles, just a little kid in middle school,
Sink my teeth in anything just to think I'm cool, riding the bus,
I feel the rush but I still don't give a fuck,
Ya I wish I could agree but I've already had enough,
I've already given up from playing the same game,
Every interview I feel like I'm saying the same thing, like,
Em was great, yea he paved the way for me,
He was inspiration for everybody from A to Z,
But they keep relating me, I cant get away,
Chasing me, (all day long), I hear it, (all day long),
And now the masters thinks that Asher wants to be a Marshall Mathers,
They say ""Ashers not a rapper, na hes actually just a actor"",
Cause we have the same complexion and similar voice inflection,
Its easy to see the pieces and reach for that connection,
Every minute, each hour of everyday,
Im constantly on the fence defending my own name,
Explaining we are not the same,
Not much that I can say, except that im sick of it,
Critics arrogantly sparked up a flame, its on

[Chorus: x2]
Take me as I em my friends, ain't goin' change,
Wont be no Em, rock these songs,
Rock these shows, only good life I know

Now don't get it twisted, I've definitely benefited,
Its like suddenly everyone wants to hear what I've been spitting,
Its so different, the image they don't get it,
Its simple I'm just a kid who wants to rap to make a living,
But Em was in it way before I committed ,
And his lyrics were the shit so I really gotta come with it,
But each critics been picking apart my writings,
And if its not up to par then Ashers par is just a gimmick,
Is it my fault must I be more convincing?,
Y'all talk all you want, never halt me from my mission,
Using his ammunition, would you please keep dissing me,
(all day long), I hear it, (all day long),
And yea the haters wanna hate because I made it and I'm famous,
But until you take my place, 
Y'all never know what it takes to make a record for respect, 
Take a second before you inspect,
When you look like someone else then what the fuck do you expect,
I just want to be accepted as the illest in the game,
But its harder for an artist creating his own lane,
That's anonymous with his rhyming and combine with perfect timing,
All the time all that's declining and about to explode

[Chorus: x2]

So fuck it that's all I got, there's nothing else for me to say,
If I don't confront the problem it will never go away,
Unless it is addressed there is nothing left for me to do,
Its impossible rejecting an elephant in the room,
Say goodbye to all the bullshit, notions preconceived
Sworn to all the wrongs, could of swore they knew me,
If you have no further questions and cant think of other thoughts,
Then let me introduce you to Asher Paul Roth.

[Chorus: x2]",As I Em,2009

And get loose, get loose, get loose, c'mon
Now you might have a shot in the dark, if you play your cards right
If not it's a long hard night
Now, what can you say to get her to leave wit'chu?
Got her in your sight, you a heat-seekin' missile
Spot her in the light, you wish you could be alone
Music in the back act like your theme song
You hate how it all sound like a ringtone

Aiyyo call the fire department cause the blaze has started
You ain't hot cause you flame retardant
I'm 'bout to hang up like a famous artist, in the Kweli museum
E'rybody feel him, can't nobody see him
Can't nobody be him, try as they might
But now it's dead, I defy afterlife
I spit in the face of the reaper as I address my wounds
Frontin for the chicks like Judy Blume
The dudes soon follow, they all sound recycled like bottles, cans
That's why I see through 'em like Hollow Man
They softer than model hands, no competition
Cause they flow not sufficient, they get thrown out the kitchen
Cause they can't take the heat, my throat is a flamethrower
Kweli and Tone ain't playin, it's game over
You could write it up, in the history books (look it up)
Or how they light it up, set it on fire, what? Fire it up!

One that they could croon

Singing weird melodies
And they made that

And from a jail came the wail
Of a down hearted frail
And they played that

Chet Atkins,"I was born on a farm out in Ioway
A flaming youth who was bound that he'd fly away
I packed my grip and I grabbed my saxophone
Can't read notes, but I play anything by ear
I made up tunes on the sounds that I used to hear
When I'd start to play folks used to say
""Sounds a little Goofus to me""
 
Cornfed chords appeal to me, I like rustic harmony
Hold that note and change the key, that's called ""Goofus""
Not according to the rules that you learn at music schools
But the folks just dance like fools, they go ""Goofus""
 
Got a job but I just couldn't keep it long
The leader said that I played all the music wrong
So I stepped out with an outfit of my own
Got together a new kind of orchestree
And we all played just the same ""Goofus"" harmony
And I must admit we made a hit
",Goofus,1961
Chet Atkins,"Evenings are crowded with memories
Thrilling me again
Like that night in spain
Someone is sharing my memories
Wonder does she grieve
Every lovely evening
 
In a little Spanish town
'Twas on a night like this
Stars were peek-a-booing down
'Twas on a night like this
I whispered ""Be true to me""
And she sighed: ""Si, Si""
Many skies have turned to gray
Because we're far apart
Many moons had passed away
And still she's in my heart
We made a promise and sealed it with a kiss
In a little Spanish town
'Twas on a night like this
 
Somehow I keep on remembering
Tears that said goodbye
Shining in her eye
Wonder does she keep remembering
Promises of mine
When the moon is shining
 
In a little Spanish town
'Twas on a night like this
Stars were peek-a-booing down
'Twas on a night like this

Always hear when you sigh
Never in my wordland 
Could there be ways to reveal
In a phrase how I feel

Have you ever heard two turtle doves
Bill and coo when they love?
That's the kind of magic 
Music we make with our lips when we kiss

And there's a weepy old willow
He really knows how to cry
That's how I'd cry in my pillow
If you should tell me farewell and goodbye

How we love to sleep
At the close of day
When the joys of the day fade away and the memories sweet
Of the day repeat 
In our dreams they creep
While we sleep, sleep, sleep
It seems that daytime was just made for laughter and song
Evening brings romance to lovers as they stroll along
Night time brings rest to the weary
Sooths all the hearts that are dreary
Leaves us alone with our day dreams
Brings back sweet golden love dreams while we sleep, sleep, sleep
How we love to sleep

Of angels singing the Ave Maria
For you're an angel, I breathe and live you
With every beat of the heart that I give you

Caring the way we care
Ours is a love so rare
 
So rare, You have the warmth of a Schubert air
Charming and debonaire
Those are the words for you
So rare You have a way that's beyond compare
That ""one in a million"" air
In everything you do
You have that something, that certain manner
You thrill me more than the ""Star Spangled Banner""
You stage a love scene, so sweetly tender
And in that love scene I gladly surrender
So rare, to have a future like yours to share

I've come to talk with you again,
Because a vision softly creeping,
Left its seeds while I was sleeping,
And the vision that was planted in my brain
Still remains
Within the sound of silence.
In restless dreams I walked alone
Narrow streets of cobblestone,
'Neath the halo of a street lamp,
I turned my collar to the cold and damp
When my eyes were stabbed by the flash of a neon light
That split the night
And touched the sound of silence.

And in the naked light I saw
Ten thousand people, maybe more.
People talking without speaking,
People hearing without listening,
People writing songs that voices never share
And no one dare
Disturb the sound of silence.

""Fools"" said I, ""You do not know
Silence like a cancer grows.
Hear my words that I might teach you,
Take my arms that I might reach you.""
But my words like silent raindrops fell,
And echoed
In the wells of silence

And the people bowed and prayed
To the neon god they made.
And the sign flashed out its warning,
In the words that it was forming.
And the sign said, ""The words of the prophets

Are written on the subway walls
And tenement halls.""
And whisper'd in the sounds of silence.",The Sound of Silence,1968
