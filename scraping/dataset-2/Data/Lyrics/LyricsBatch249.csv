Falconer,"Hold the sceptre to the sky,
hold it high to be cleansed.
Climb the ancient stone,
you child of innocence.

Take the sceptre
you who didn't crave it,
reach to the heaven
and let it be blessed.
Cherish the throne
of blood with your purity.
Crowned by us,
estates in unity.

We chose the boy to be king,
there is no blood in his crown.

Remember the past
and bear it inside.
Witness the end
of the deceiving ride.",Child of Innocence,2003
Falconer,"Blow your trumpets, let the feast begin.
Sing for us minstrels tonight.
Let the coronation shimmer and shine
In the golden sun so bright.

In a velvet mantle he takes the oath:
I will protect and serve my homeland
In the name of our lord.
Stand by me and we will prevail.
Hail!

Remember the words of the old and wise
About what's wrong and what's right.
Do you know greed's face, the tongue of the snake
Or the shades of black and white?

Receive the crown
And wear it with pride.
With it comes more than just the glory and gold.
Embrace the task
To stand by our side.
Fight for our freedom with the powers you now hold.",The Coronation,2003
Falconer,"Fly away my homeward mind,
Out from darkness and touch the sky.
Chained and restless
Yet flying high,
On wings of joy leaving my
Fate behind.

I feel the silence,
I feel the dawn
Coming closer for every
Breath I take.
I hear my maker
Calling my name all day
So God, hear me pray.

Please forgive us for our sins,
Let not eternity yet begin.
Lost and broken
For the things we've done.
Longing to be caressed
By morning's sun.

Oh, please wait with paradise.
We are but fools in this
Castle of ice.",Hear Me Pray,2003
Falconer,"From the western realm they marched
Through thunder, storm and rain
On a mission to quell the snakes.

You will search every hole
And turn every stick and stone.
Bring them out to light.

The hooves were pounding over the northland
While the battle cries rise high,
Shaking up the distant skies.
The reaper had them close at hand
Not losing them out of sight
From early morning until the night.

From the southern realm they marched
To gaze into their eyes
Illuminate all the lies

No mercy will be shown
To stop their reckless minds
Burn them out and make them blind

Pace onward you boldest of men
Our time will come when we reach the end
We will descend

In the mist of the twilight tonight
When the sky is clear and the stars shine bright
Their land we'll smite.",Hooves Over Northland,2003
Falconer,"Step inside and join us tonight.
Don't stand in the cold like strangers.

Thank you brother, we kindly accept.
Let us feast tonight to the grace of God

The night continued in a high mood
but when all had went to bed
a darker temper started to intrude.
The royal pair, surprised!

This night of infamy
I will never forget
nor will my brothers,
the vengeance I'll get.
I'll leave you restless,
I'll leave you blind
until one night:
A stab from behind.

Although my eyes beheld cheap
I should not have mistaken the wolves' scent.

Their souls awaits nocturnal domains
their sweet taste of victory is only lent.

Locked behind steel and stone,
locked away by infamy.
Listening to my reflections of life.
Starving us to skin and bone,
leaving us to agony.
Seeing signs too late of their strife.

Now we are the ones to rule
the kingdom like it should,
as finally the credulous fool
is set aside for all of time.",Night of Infamy,2003
Falconer,"I hope the future guides you well
Through archways paved in gold.
I hope tomorrow leads you right.
(To the gates of heaven!!)
Count on me to stand by your side
in storms as well as sunshine.
Count on me to hail your name.
(As you see the bright light!!)

Drop the crown onto my head,
I'll mourn your death with
tears that needs to be shed.

Fall down and bow your heads for me
I am the king you all sought me, to be
To pledge you freedom

There are no dark clouds in the sky
So trouble not your mind.
There is no reason to rise.
(Keep your great halls heated!!)

I hope the future guides you well
through archways paved in gold.
I hope tomorrow leads you right.

Drop the crown onto my head,
I'll mourn your death with
Tears that wants to be shed.

Fall down and bow your heads for me
I am the king you all sought me, to be
To pledge you freedom

No more lies, deceits or malice
Will haunt this family again
Linger on to life, and confirm you shelter
Mark my words, I tell you the truth",Pledge for Freedom,2003
Falconer,"There you finally are, sister of the winds
And mother of my future deeds.
I'm in a battle I yet can't win,
So help me and tell me what you need.

Let's hear what burdens your royal heart bears,
Is it a burden of love or of hate?
Tell me what obstacle lies in your way
And I'll see what can be done to fate.

Twice they count, the unfaithful.
The infidels of the crown.
The dark one's pretenders
Trying to bring us down.

So let your magic be unleashed
And dispose of the false serpents of the night.

Poorly my powers will bite, I can not harm royal blood.
I am not able to assist you in your fight.

Witch, be gone then out of my sight
And take your feeble pitiable tricks and hide.

I shall be gone soon, though I give you one advice:
Take the highest caution your wisdom can provide.",Ravenhair,2003
Falconer,"It is with joy that I greet you
Come inside and taste what's served for you
Food does not lack, neither does wine

Let's stir the mighty cauldron
Love versus hate

By the scepter of deception

Toast for you
And your glorious kingdom
The home of heroes since early days

Toast for us
And the newborn friendship
It will now lead us on our way

When the night became morning
The fire was no more, just a red glow
Down from the stairs the guards did descend

Action or fate
Let's stir the mighty cauldron
Love versus hate

Action or fate
Let's stir the mighty cauldron

Storming in upon us in the night
What is this supposed to be?
Give me my sword and I'll

Our swords are useless here and now
So give up this pointless fight
Doomed is our fate tonight

Ease this burden for I cannot bear it
When dark shadows upon my soul play
Can't look into the future
As my eyes see not the light of day

Maybe you remember the game you played
Me and my queen years ago?
Now it's my time to play

Who is laughing so evil?
It's the queen behind the walls of greed
What cruel deed has she now done?

Action or fate
Let's stir the mighty cauldron
Love versus hate

",The Spectre of Deception,2003
Falconer,"Soaked in the silver rain
They rode through the woods.
Crossed the mountains
And crossed the rivers so deep.
They came at dawn
With fire and steel,
Left at dusk, a trail of flames.

Reach up high to touch the sky,
Brothers in arms side by side.
In defiance we unite
For the glory and victory
And for the times soon to be.

Erik and Valdemar:
The trail of flames will be our harbinger.
Let the fire mark our words.
The trail of flames
Our messenger on black wings,
Let our answer be heard.

Erik:
Ride on for me my friends
And fear no more.
Ride for freedom
And ride for the truth.
We'll come at dawn again
With fire and steel
Leaving nothing but ashes behind.

Valdemar:
Although we're bonded by blood
We're divided by the Lord's pride.
Dishonouring we will not stand
Nor will God who stands by our side.
",The Trail of Flames,2003
Falconer,"They burst through the gates
With swords in hand they made their way
Cross the hall of the high lord.

As long as that man lives
Peace will never propagate
Between me and my brothers here
So yield yourself to your fate!

The king stood still in the back,
Grey in face and without will
Not knowing wrong from right.

You have brought shame and disgrace
To soil your fathers' name
And heaven will not easily
Forget the game you've played.

The limbs of the lord was chained,
He was bound to a horse then they rode away
Through a cold winter storm.
Travelling night and day
Through a kingdom of snow
And finally arriving at
The castle of his foes.

He was shackled to the wall,
In the tower high above the ground
He was kept like a common thief.
And meanwhile the brothers three
Feasted into the night
And toasted time after time
Until the morning light.

He was sentenced to death by the blade.
In the name of high treason
He died under the sword.

We have harvested the crops
Of the evil seed
That grew between you and me
But now united we'll lead!",Under the Sword,2003
Falconer,"Lonely hunter spying through the night.
Beast of pleasure, a gambler in pain.
Time after time always on the hunt
It will lead you round your grave.
You'll go down with a grunt.

You feel like a tiger, rush is in your veins.
You have to try to break these chains,
annihilation will grab onto your bone.
The assailant is you on your own.

Like a tiger closing in for a bite.
Do not see the danger that lies deep within.
Watching, waiting, ready for the play.
So beware, don't you stray.",The Assailant,2005
Falconer,"Gaze into nature's eyes
Is there spite, is there greed?
Face your fellow man,
Realize he's of evil breed.
We ought to be afraid of ourselves.

You must not live in fear
For the child of the wild.
Look around, do you see
The beast in you and me?

Take a step into the wild,
Horrific creatures will hide.
You're the terror well disguised,
You're the fear that locks itself inside.
We ought to be afraid of ourselves.

Embrace the untamed
See the grandeur under the grime.
Feel a rising peace
By a wind from deep seas.

Surrounded by a big crowd:
You feel secure in the night.
Black waters and dark woods:
And you tremble by fright.
We ought to be afraid of ourselves.",Child of the Wild,2005
Falconer,"I will not scream out in anger
Won't play this game forever.
Make up your mind or I will take control.
Why can't we end this nightmare.
If that's your way take your share,
Leave this now or I will loose my mind.

I will not scream in the night.
Come join in and stand side by side.

Come take my hand, let us fly away
Cross emotional skies.
(The dreams will come alive)
Follow me up through the clouds of grey
And into another day.

All people try to tell me:
""That's not the way it should be,
It's just the poison, feeding on your brain.""
But in the lonesome night
They don't know the fight,
The battle that is raging inside my head.

You brought down the moon
So let your eyes light up the night.
Save me from darkness.",Emotional Skies,2005
Falconer,"Live your dream and live it well.
Soon comes the night
And you will dream in hell.
Build a tower to the sky.
Take on the powers
Not meant for you and I.

Can you walk on the water? NO!
Make no attempt, just turn around and go.

We are heading for the end
You found the key to immortality.
Thorns always come with the rose.
Here is what you got:
Humanity overdose.

For all of, eternity
She has played this game.
From half of, a century
Can you do the same?

Realize the holy Grail,
My oh my what a perfect plan.
But wait, the chalice's looking pale,
Polish it up if you can.

Step into the holy land.
Watch every move
'Cause damnation is at hand.
The gift of life is so divine.
But without death
Life will soon decline.",Humanity Overdose,2005
Falconer,"I can not stand your lovin'
I got to go,
Go and find myself some peace.
Go bitch on someone else
I'll take no more,
No more frustration to the core.

I refuse to stand by you
And see my future life through tortured eyes.
I can not do what you want me to,
I will not try to hide myself inside.

No more interrogation.
Accusations will end,
I'll put an end to my disgrace.
Take your opinion elsewhere
And leave me be,
Leave me to let me lead me free.

No more lost sleep.
No more lost love,
I'm free.
No more blames and
No more chains 'cause
I'm free.",I Refuse,2005
Falconer,"I'm a grim and lonesome wanderer.
I walk you through the night.
Lurking in the shadows, waiting for a bite.
You don't know who I am,
But I'm nasty and obscene.
I'll take you life cut your throat,
Fulfilling all my dreams.

You're never safe when you're alone
And you won't feel a thing
When I loot your body.
Digging in the grime.

I fool you first with candy,
I trick you to bone.
Make you feel safe and sound,
Not grasp you're on your own.
My work is swift you feel no pain,
You won't understand.
My blade is sharp your thorax's mine,
Your heart is in my hand

Do you know me now?
I'm Jack the Ripper
Do you know me now?
I'm Jack the knife.

So young and sweet but not innocent,
Consuming every man.
You can't be missed, I'll take my chance.
Yes, I'll be damned.
No one knows my identity
But I'm a legend of my time
And I'm feared for what I've done
This little game of mine.",Jack the Knife,2005
Falconer,"Millions of fears are howling loud.
The tarn of tears is running out,
You reside to far away.
East and west and down below.
It's easier to let it go,
Not always bothered by the truth.

Darkened sky on middle day.
Destruction there, so they can't stay.
""Sorry boys"", but you're alone.
The troops of doom has left the ground.
Take the shit, fire another round.
Eat the dirt, the crap is yours.

Over foggy waters, I reach the shore.
I can't sympathize, can't sense anymore.

I'll shed no tears for strangers.
Save my crying until another day.
Maybe sorrows are coming my way.

The mill is grinding trough the gloom.
Ghastly eyes gaze at the moon.
In palest glow the dreams descend.
So in the end I'm not so bad.
Don't have the time, I don't feel sad
That's the way so let me be.

The distance between you and me:
The scale of my emotionality.
My heart ain't weak enough
To bleed for all the tragedy.
If I was to feel for one and all
I would probably crumble and fall.
My heart ain't rich enough
To suffer your reality.",No Tears for Strangers,2005
Falconer,"Kick your roots, break the bonds.
When you get some, you need some more.
Our credence made you strong
While your honesty's weaker than before.

Trample down their dreams
To feed your own.
The glory of your fortune,
Celebrate it alone.

You've got power power,
To devour.
Use it with sense and the glory is yours.
Hear our call of justice for all.
You've got the power in your hands.

The road to your success,
It is paved with your shameless lies.
Turn you head, see us hanging
With your lonely avaricious eyes.

When you reach the top
You will find the rainbow's gold.
Don't lose your mind
With our trust that you hold.
Do not join up
In the jesters masquerade,
Don't spoil your wine
With that bitter bouquet.",Power,2005
Falconer,"Cry cry, cry your eyes out.
You'll get no pity out of me.
Try try, to lie your way out.
It will not fool me you'll see.

You alone have picked the game,
There is no one else to blame.

Reality closes in
on your life filled of sin,
it's purgatory time.
It's your time to live the sum
of the acts you have done,
it's purgatory time.

No no, chance for pardon.
Don't try to plead unsound mind.
Go go, and try to bargain.
Your conscience's left far behind.",Purgatory Time,2005
Falconer,"Don't let your mind pollute you,
you're screwing your brain.
The end is no beginning, you must break the chain.

The voices wail
(Don't do this, don't do that.)
You must not fail.
Maybe it's near
(In the dark they remind.)
Dream dreams in fear,
please wake up.

Not on your own,
you still have time to see what you can discover.
We all long for your return.

Don't let the drugs abuse you,
you must take control.
The circle keeps on spinning, endless like a roll.",The Return,2005
Falconer,"You grasped a pot of gold,
Now it looks like led.
On your path of hunger
The gold lies still ahead.

At the end of the rainbow
Another rainbow starts.

Try to catch the shadows
And run until you fall.
Strain your nerves to follow
The temptations of them all.

The prizes fade with time
As day fades into night.
The state of satisfaction
Is a slowly dying high.

As sun descends in the sky
The hunt is on for the dawn.
Chasing tricks of the day through the night.

The scent of dawn is so sweet
But it is spoiled with each bite.
Losing pace among all of the treats.
",Catch the Shadows,2006
Falconer,"En man han tjänt Herr Lagers gård
I sommar, vinter år för år
Säg mej, vem sörjer nu för dej?

För slit och släp under himmel grå

Så kommer hastigt budet in

Varken öl eller vin dej ämnat
Ej heller ägorätt
Dock skula skorpa, skalk

Träl visste ej ett ord utav
Förrns strupen hans var skuren av
Säg mej, vem skulle värna om dej?

Det här är nog för bot idag
Och dotra tar jag vid behag
Säg mej, vem skulle värna om dej?

Kom jag ska visa dej min rätt
Att trösta dej på valfritt sätt

Falkenbach,"In ancient times once rode across the land
A man unknown on a horse of untold grand,
Adorned his cape by thirty runes of gold
Of whom the tales since ages unknown told

The man arrived at the shore of sea
And gazed onto the nightly sky,
His ears could hear and his eyes could see
Two ravens dark as night passing by

In a distance far the thunder sounds
And lightnings reached the frozen grounds,
His breath ran fast, his heart pounded strong
As the day now came, awaited oh so long

Tears will fall and blood will soon be shed
When the dawn heralds the twilight of the day
Then into battle they will ride with their swords in hand
For a heathenish foray

Countless miles he rode through ice and knee-deep snow
Over mountains 'till the landscape changed its face
So he at last arrived where winds blew strong and chill
Like a welcome to all those who trod this place

He in cape was wrapped, and with his hammer 'round his neck
He forced his way though he didn't saw the path,
But he did not rest, 'till he had crossed this land of chill
And the storm had calmed, when he stood alone on hill

His eyes could see the forest shining bright
And it's trees reflected solens golden light,
The sound of horns then reached his ears
To welcome him and take away his fears

From all their lands the kings, they came
With their retinue of countless men,
And the maiden in full armor sat on their horses,
Winged, until the right began

So he rested a while an recovered from his ride,
The horizon gleamed by the mighty northers light,
And the elder ones sang tales about the past,
Of their ancestors pride, that will forever last

As the darkness fell and gone was solens light
The silence ruled amongst the men of heathen pride,
Who gather in a mighty battle-line
And awaited their Gods to give the final sign",Heathen Foray,2006

Maybe he won't find out what I know

Someday I'll appreciate in value, get off my ass and call you
But for the meantime I'll sport my
Brand new fashion of waking up with pants on at 4:00 in the afternoon

In the mirror he practices all his lines
To his closing argument twelve hearts beat in favor
I'm guessing that he read the morning paper
The headline reads: ""The man hangs, but the jury doesn't.""

And everybody's looking for relief
The United States versus disbelief
Mothers cast tears on both sides of the aisle
From face to wall the body falls like bachelors or bad luck girls
Only breathing with the aid of the knife

Case open, case shut
But you could pay to close it like a casket
Baby boy can't lift his headache head
Isn't it tragic?

He glances at his pew seating seven to twelve stacked
On one to six the gallery is hushed
Boys in three pieces dream of girls' daring and bravado
The city streets in a cell not withstanding what we all know
Hang on the rope of baited breath
Whichever you prefer

And everyone's looking for relief
A bidding war for an old friend's grief
The calls for chique, the calls for charm
Another girl that's not aware but that can make you comprehend
Too well dressed for the witness stand
The best place for whichever headlines run

And sugar, we're goin' down swinging
Dance, dance, we're falling apart to halftime
Dance, dance, and these are the lives you'd love to lead
Dance, this is the way they'd love
If they knew how misery loved me
This ain't a scene, it's a goddamn arms race
This ain't a scene, it's a goddamn arms race
One night and one more time
Thanks for the memories

He tastes like you, only sweeter

I got troubled thoughts
And the self-esteem to match

I miss missing you now and then

Making eyes at this husk around my heart
I see through you when we’re sitting in the dark
So give me your filth
Make it rough
Let me, let me trash your love

I will sing to you every day
If it will take away the pain
Oh and I’ve heard you got it, got it so bad
'Cause I am the best you’ll never have

Baby, you were my picket fence

You are a brick tied to me that's dragging me down
Strike a match and I'll burn you to the ground
We are the jack-o-lanterns in July setting fire to the sky
Here, here comes this rising tide, so come on

Put on your war paint

Cross walks and crossed hearts and hope-to-dies
Silver clouds with grey linings

So we can take the world back from a heart attack
One maniac at a time we will take it back
You know time crawls on when you're waiting for the song to start
So dance alone to the beat of your heart

Hey young blood, doesn't it feel like our time is running out?
I'm gonna change you like a remix
Then I'll raise you like a phoenix
Wearing our vintage misery
No, I think it looked a little better on me
I'm gonna change you like a remix
Then I'll raise you like a phoenix

Bring home the boys and scrap scrap metal the tanks
Get hitched, make a career out of robbing banks
Because the world is just a teller and we are wearing black masks
""You broke our spirit,"" says the note we pass

So we can take the world back from a heart attack
One maniac at a time we will take it back
You know time crawls on when you're waiting for the song to start
So dance alone to the beat of your heart

Hey young blood, doesn't it feel like our time is running out?

No graphics and no fucking PowerPoint presentation

Are you ready for another bad poem?
One more off key anthem
Let your teeth sink in
Remember me as I was not as I am
And I said ""I'll check in tomorrow if I don't wake up dead,""

'Cause it's never

We are professional ashes of roses
This kerosene's live
You settled your score
This is where you come to beg, unborn and unshaven
Killing fields of fire to a congress of ravens
This is what we do, we nightmare you

I'm about to make the sweat roll backwards
And your heart beat in reverse
Our guts can't be reworked
As alone as a little white church in the middle of the desert
Getting burned
But I'll take your heart served up two ways
I sing a bitter song
I'm the lonelier version of you
I just don't know where I went wrong

What did it ever mean to you?

Again and again 'til I’m stuck in your head
Head my downward spiral, never mind I'll be drowned

They could heat or cool the room
And now don’t tell me you’re fine

I wish I cared enough to know, um, hmm

Just like Judy
The kind that makes June feel like September
I'm the last one that you'll ever remember

And I'm trying to find that peace of mind
Behind these two white highway lines
When the city goes silent
The ringing in my ears gets violent

She's in a long black coat tonight
Waiting for me in the downpour outside
She's singing ""Baby come home"" in a melody of tears
While the rhythm of the rain keeps time

Or did you never want to be alone?

Honey, don't you leave

Don't you remember how we used to split a drink?
It never mattered what it was
I think our hands were just that close
The sweetness never lasted, no

Bad trip I couldn't get off
And maybe I bit off more than I could chew
And overhead of the aqua blue

Fall to your knees bring on the rapture
Blessed be the boys time can't capture
On film or between the sheets
I always fall from your window
To the pitch black streets

And with the black banners raised as the crooked smiles fade
Former heroes who quit too late
Just wanna fill up the trophy case again

So put all of your anger on
In the truly gruesome do we trust
I will always land on you like a sucker punch

Singing I am your worst, I am your worst nightmare
I am your worst, I am your worst nightmare

If you knew, knew what the bluebirds sing at you
You would never sing along
Cast them out 'cause this is our culture
These new flocks are nothing but vultures

Because they took our love and they filled it up
Filled it up with novocaine and now I'm just numb
And now I'm just numb
Don't mind me, I'm just a son of a gun
So don't stop, don't stop 'till your heart goes numb
And now I'm just numb
I don't feel a thing for you

I'm just a problem that doesn't wanna be solved
So could you please hold your applause
Take this sideshow and all its freaks
And turn it into the silver screen dream

Singing I am your worst, I am your worst nightmare
I am your worst, I am your worst nightmare

If you knew, knew what the bluebirds sing at you,

Your grandfather would probably roll in his grave
If he knew of that person that you had became

Not again, not again

There I was, strung out and drug through the mud
I must agree, you're just like me

And when you die
I won't be at your wake
No eulogy from me
Just a smile on my face
And while God might be busy
With judging your soul
I will have slept with the girl
That you loved most

You have left my heart, black and blue

I'm not sorry for the mess that I have made.
So can you tell me what will you do,
When everything you know turns right around on you.

I will throw up all of these lies
You let them nail me to your cross.
No matter how, what, where or when.
I'll always lay down for all your sins.

My dad told me not to bite my tongue,
I hate my momma cause she left me with no love.
I bottled it up, I sweeped it under the rug (hate my mother).

Then we're living in a world where the evil wins.

Who knows what the future brings but eventually the truth will prevail.
It's moments like these where you really got to think about the broken dreams that you sell.

We are the indigo
And we will never give up
Never let go

Hmmm...yes sirrrrrr
Rock and roll, man roll and rock
I got tens, got twentys, got fifty blocks
I got smoke to buy, coke for sale
Sold much coke, got coke in jail
In the white Rolls Royce with my man Pharrell
This lil' nigga got beats too fresh to be stale
But I'ma take you back to the early eighties
When my cousin Stacey had the pearl Mercedes
My aunt cousin Wack had the black on black
Ac' coupe Legend with the gold in the back
I was just a lil' young'n runnin' wild as hell
Runnin' round wild trynta get that mail
Lil' shorty dudes trynta learn the grooves
I was twelve years old brought it to the school
Cause I was quick to flip, quick to sell that shit
You ain't from the hood, y'all don't know bout this

[Hook 1]
But if you feel me, throw your bows up (Star Track)
Try to set up shop get glowed up
Hey, I'm the candyman, I got mo' than frozen cups
I got your chop top sour diesel roll-ups
Fam! we can roll up (Star Track)
But Fam! don't try to roll up (Star Track)
Don't make me pull these motherfuckin' fo's up
Cause it's like that

[Verse 2: Fam-Lay]
The fiends is dyin', things is lyin'
Missin' on the streets, so the fiends is still buyin'
Right on time and money on the mind and
On them twenty-fo's, them bit-ches straight shinin'
But y'all niggaz don't know bout this
Fresh new kicks with the new outfit
Got the all black top with the black on black
You ever see me creepin, just back on back
Cause I got that pump and it is gon' spit
I ain't no punk and I ain't no snitch
From a place on Earth called Huntersville
Where people out there got love for real
Got love for all who got love for me
If a coward ever ran then it wasn't me
I'll be on the curb movin' dubs and d's
And if you ever bought a dub then it was for me
I ever get caught then it was to be
I'ma just make bail by my cousin E
Back on the Porsche with the mobile phone
Like eleven in the mornin' them hoes to go home
Trynta score and get this shit off quick
You ain't from the hood, y'all don't know bout this

[Hook 1]
[Hook 2]
Aww shit, this is the part when the fight just start
When the fists get to swingin' and the four-fifths spark
And then the bitches get to runnin' and the bitch just scream
And we spin off in Rolls and it's so damn clean

[Verse 3: Fam-Lay]
I stand on my block, the cam on the spot
My hands in my pocket, both hammers is cocked
Waitin' for a nigga to just act up
My right hand big six, got my bait back up
Niggaz lookin' all jealous, lookin' mad as hell
Actin' like lil' girls, like tattle-tales
Mad cause my right hand bad as hell
I would've kept shootin', but I had a sale
See, I'm a crime boss three sixty-five
Lookin' for a Nina Ross, she just can ride
Picked up my cash and slide all sweet
Nigga tried to snatch ass, knocked his heart off beat
Nigga talk trash like the shit all sweet
won't'cha all take the cash dogg, not off me
Hustlin's in my veins - you cannot stop it
Walkin' on the block with life in my pocket
I'm trynta score and get this shit off quick
You ain't from the ghetto, y'all don't know bout this

That’s three muscles recertified
I’m right, niggas be watching, they don’t want these problems
When them bills due, niggas get ready cause no bullshit I’m buyin’
I’m a government baby, let me get my cheese, let me get my cheese
Got a Chevy trailer in my mama yard, sittin’ on E’s
I’m bout this fee, I’m bout this fee
Just know what’s free
You were born with a silver spoon in your mouth so don’t critique
Look at me nigga, just a young hood nigga tryna get this cake
I don’t need to be givin’ out how school gon’ educate
Filet mignon for my food stamps I know mama credit quite good
So I’m out here with this dope money got a big body in my hood
Nigga you see it, better believe it, this what I’m bout
Got a trap house I be boomin’ in, fiends in and out

Where I’m from we be actually hoopin’ in Jordans
Five dollar white t-shirts and them loose cigarettes
Ain’t nobody fit to do shit important
People really don’t give no fuck about nothing
Although they may smile and be cordial
Dealin’ around with the wrong damn crowd
Then bring a frown to my friend [?] warn you
Background check for the chopper
[?] imposters
The murder rate ain’t back down yet
To the nigga that was tryna say somethin’
Some people, listen, you could be predisposed or be preconditioned
Or speak with the preacher, been preaching be the person
To be some process in your progress or be the prevention
I just live my life and I don’t stop grindin’ until God tell me to
I get money, I ain’t gotta sell my soul, ho, who the hell is you?
They say my kind ain’t welcome everywhere, well I can deal with that
But those who pop they shit get the shit popped outta them it's still a fact
So mind your business and stay the fuck outta mine
You’ll shortly find that this is best for everyone involved

I been smokin’ since a pre-teen toddler
I been servin’ since a jit tryna dodge all the obstacles
My teachers all told me that were probable
Probable cause, no crack a never really had it
I was just a nigga in a high price whip
Yea, I’m just a nigga with an education brought up in the ghetto
Well you better have extension on the clip
Well beef comes around in the town more often than these bitches in motion
I got a yapper, five dollars, off the streets
Yea I’m told for protection more than anything
Don’t test my devotion
My first amendment right, they violate it anytime we out smokin’
Chicago violence boostin’ up but we just focussin’ on other environments
Apologize cause [?] promotin’
Chopper and my bitch they ain’t kissin’ light somebody up
You just tell them [?] who stole it
Rich gunplay, shit that’s all they see that’s all they know
Without it kinda hopeless

They tellin’ me i'm a fellon
I beat the case and that’s it
And I wasn’t acquainted with him
But I’m tryna make it to Heaven
But they don’t want me to make it
That’s why the niggas be tellin’ me
If I don’t get the chopper I’mma probly run up inside them
They better gimme a answer, I’m tryna be cool
If I don’t get it then everybody gon’ fear it
Every week I’m finna make ‘em repeat it like they in school

2014 is our year
Big shout out to the whole streets
This goes out to all that knows me
All y’all pussy niggas, holies
Y’all play tough guys but call the police
Look I don’t care, I don’t share
I keep me a bad bitch around here
I send them choppers around there
When I’m somewhere sittin’ in a lounge chair
Overseas, blowin’ tree, blowin’ green, throwin’ B's
Livin’ like life is supposed to be
And if you wanna see it all, nigga roll with me
To the top, couldn’t stop, had a major deal but it wouldn’t pop
Niggas hated on me but I wouldn’t stop
And now life sweeter than a puddin’ pop
Think so slick, come and get me dog
None of y’all niggas fuckin’ with me dog
Some of y’all niggas comin’ with me dog
None of y’all niggas' boots fit me dog
You think an echo was y’all
You need to think tactical dog

Then pick a different zone for your mobile homes
Store fingerprints on your mobile phone

Cost more than my house did
Fuck land, I’m fly today
First class if I fly
Credit card ain’t mine
Don’t know how I’m getitn’ back
But in luxury I arrive
iPhone in my baby name
Long way from that chirp
Strip pole in my bedroom
But I’mma kill my daughter if she twerk
I’mma kill my daughter if she twerk
Miley Cyrus is that bullshit
But a rednecker can’t judge
That for Billy Ray to have to deal with
Record deal, fuck college
Missed out but no pyrex
My Harley got low mileage
This white carpet in my project
30 guns in my section, none of the homies got [?]

At least it’s a contradiction, you’ll feel us
RIP to the homies but long live the killas

And the mamas can’t stop us

Just so I can face another day
Wash away my tears
And tell me everything's gonna be ok

Would you lie to me?
Would you cover up me eyes?
Would you tell me so I'm not so surprised?

Wish you'd bring me in again
But I know inside that I've reached the end

Where my true love goes every night
And takes a strange one upon his knee
And don't you know, now, that vexes me.
I know my love is an arrant rover
And he'll go roaming the wide world over
In foreign parts he may chance to stray
Where all the girls are so bright and gay,
If my love knew I could wash and wring
If my love knew I could weave and spin
I'd make a dress all of the finest kind
But the want of money leaves me behind.

It's tumbling, fumbling, you love that sound

Ok, she kept it on the down-low
So tell me what's the deally-yo
I can't believe she did what she did to me
Alright, now bring me back my things gurl
You're no longer in my world
I don't think that you need to be talking to me
All about how you said you love me
You miss me terribly
Well, I don't buy that at all
What am I gonna do about this situation at hand
My paranoia is starting to kick in
A busy signal is all I ever hear
We used to talk a lot but now she's seemed to disappear

[Chorus]
I think I've found out
What's going on
About my girlfriend not calling me up on the phone
And if it's gonna be like this everyday I cannot see-cope
So where do I go from here
I found out that she's calling up my best friend
Who said he'd never ever ever go and do this again
I think I'm g'on take this knife outta my back and give it back to him
She just became my Ex-girlfriend

She doesn't know where we stand
I hope she takes it just like I am
She doesn't know it at all

[Chorus x2]

What happened to us? Can you tell me?
What happened to us? Can you tell me where I went wrong?
What happened to us? What happened to us, yeah

Deep in your eyes around
Feel my devotion
High like a bird you fly
But leave my heart behind

Why fall your tears away
Tell me you need me
We can see better days
Reach out and touch me
Maybe it's hard to try
But don't you say goodbye

Angel eyes I hear you crying
Your heart is sighing
Are you gonna stay
Angel eyes you're must be lying
Your love can wait for me another day
Angel eyes, please stay
Angel eyes, I pray
Angel eyes you mean the world to me

How could it end this way
Can you forgive me ?
How could an angel say
Love has an ending

Fanfare Trumpeters of the Welsh Guard,"In the bleak midwinter, frost wind made moan,
Earth stood hard as iron, water like a stone,
Snow had fallen, snow on snow, snow on snow,
In the bleak midwinter, long ago.

Our God, heaven cannot hold him, nor earth sustain,
Heaven and earth shall flee away when he comes to reign.
In the bleak midwinter a stable place sufficed
The Lord God Almighty, Jesus Christ.

Angels and archangels may have gathered there,
Cherubim and seraphim thronged the air,
But his mother only, in her maiden bliss,
Worshiped the beloved with a kiss.

On the feast of Stephen,
When the snow lay round about,
Deep and crisp and even.

Though the frost was cruel,
When a poor man came in sight,
Gathering winter fuel.

Hither, page, and stand by me.
If thou know it telling:
Yonder peasant, who is he?
Where and what his dwelling? 
Sire, he lives a good league hence,
Underneath the mountain,
Right against the forest fence
By Saint Agnes fountain.

Bring me flesh, and bring me wine.
Bring me pine logs hither.
Thou and I will see him dine
When we bear the thither. 
Page and monarch, forth they went,
Forth they went together
Through the rude wind's wild lament
And the bitter weather.

Sire, the night is darker now,
And the wind blows stronger.
Fails my heart, I know not how.
I can go no longer. 
Ark my footsteps my good page,
Tread thou in them boldly:
Thou shalt find the winter's rage
Freeze thy blood less coldly.

In his master's step he trod,
Where the snow lay dented.
Heat was in the very sod
Which the saint had printed.
Therefore, Christian men, be sure,
Wealth or rank possessing,
Ye who now will bless the poor
Shall yourselves find blessing","Good King Wenceslas (Piae Cantiones, 1582)",1996

Fania All-Stars,"Over time, I've been building
My castle of love
Just for two, though you never
Knew you were my reason
I've gone much too far for you
Now to say
That I've got to throw my
Castle away

Over dreams, I have picked out
A perfect come true
Though you never knew it was
Of you I've been dreaming
The sandman has come from
Too far away
For you to say come back some
Other day

And though you don't believe
That they do
They do come true
For did my dreams
Come true when I looked at you
And maybe too, if you
Would believe
You too might be
Overjoyed, over loved, over me

Over hearts, I have painfully
Turned every stone
Just to find, I had found what
I've searched to discover
I've come much too far for me
Now to find
The love that I sought can never
Be mine

And though you don't believe
That they do
They do come true
For did my dreams
Come true when I looked at you
And maybe too, if you
Would believe
You too might be
Overjoyed, over loved, over me

And though the odds
Say improbable
What do they know
For in romance
All true love needs is a chance
And maybe with a chance you
Will find
You too like I
Overjoyed, over loved, over
You, over you

De fiesta y ron, noche y rumba
Su plan es falso igual
Que aquel amor que lo engaño

Vestido a la última moda y perfumado

Con zapato en colores

En su camino los saludan

Que solo calman los tragos

Fanny Ardant,"Une nuit je m'endors avec lui
Mais je sais qu'on nous l'interdit
Et je sens la fièvre qui me mord
Sans que j'aie l'ombre d'un remords

Et l'aurore m'apporte le sommeil
Je ne veux pas qu'arrive le soleil
Quand je prends sa tête entre mes mains
Je vous jure que j'ai du chagrin

Et je me demande
Si cet amour aura un lendemain
Quand je suis loin de lui
Quand je suis loin de lui
Je n'ai plus vraiment toute ma tête
Et je ne suis plus d'ici
Oh, je ne suis plus d'ici
Je ressens la pluie d'une autre planète
D'une autre planète

Quand il me serre tout contre lui
Quand je sens que j'entre dans sa vie
Je prie pour que le destin m'en sorte
Je prie pour que le diable m'emporte

Et l'angoisse me montre son visage
Elle me force à parler son langage
Mais quand je prends sa tête entre mes mains
Je vous jure que j'ai du chagrin

Et je me demande
Si cet amour aura un lendemain
Quand je suis loin de lui
Quand je suis loin de lui
Je n'ai plus vraiment toute ma tête
Et je ne suis plus d'ici
Non je ne suis plus d'ici

Fanny Brice,"It's cost me a lot
But there's one thing that I've got 
It's my man
Cold and wet, tired you bet
But all that I soon forget 
With my man
He's not much for looks 
And no hero out of books 
Is my man
Two or three girls has he 
That he likes as well as me
But I love him! 
I don't know why I should
He isn't good, he isn't true
He beats me too
What can I do?
 
Oh, my man I love him so
He'll never know
All my life is just despair
But I don't care 
When he takes me in his arms 
The world is bright, all right
What's the difference if I say
I'll go away, When I know
I'll come back on my knees some day?
For whatever my man is 
I am his forever more
Oh, my man I love him
 
Sometimes I say 
If I could just get away 
With my man
He'd go straight sure as fate
For it never is too late
For a man
I just like to dream 
Of a cottage by a stream 
With my man
Where a few flowers grew
And perhaps a kid or two
Like my man
And then my eyes get wet
I most forget till he gets hot
And tells me not to talk such rot
 
Oh, my man I love him so
He'll never know
All my life is just despair
But I don't care 
When he takes me in his arms 
The world is bright, all right
What's the difference if I say 
I'll go away, When I know
I'll come back on my knees some day?
For what ever my man is 
I am his forever more",My Man,1991
Fanny Brice,"Father has a business, strictly second-hand
Everything from toothpicks to a baby grand
Stuff in our apartment came from father's store
Even clothes I'm wearing someone wore before
It's no wonder that I feel abused
I never get a thing that ain't been used
I'm wearing second-hand hats
Second-hand clothes
That's why they call me
Second-hand Rose
Even our piano in the parlor
Daddy bought for ten cents on the dollar
Second-hand pearls
I'm wearing second-hand curls
I never get a single thing that's new
Even Jake, the plumber, he's a man I adore
He had the nerve to tell me he's been married before
Everyone knows that I'm just

Fanny Brice,"I have got a sweetie known as Susie
In the words of Shakespeare she's a ""wow""
Though all of you may know her, too
I'd like to shout right now

Suzie has a perfect reputation
No one ever saw her on a spree
Nobody knows where Susie goes
Nobody knows but me

If you knew Susie, like I know Susie
Oh! Oh! Oh! What a girl
There's none so classy
As this fair lassie
Oh! Oh! Holy Moses, what a chassis
We went riding, she didn't balk
Back from Yonkers
I'm the one that had to walk
If you knew Susie, like I know Susie
Oh! Oh! What a girl!

If you knew Susie, like I know Susie
Oh! Oh! Oh! What a girl
She wears long tresses
And nice tight dresses
Oh! Oh!
What a future she possesses
Out in public
How she can yawn
In a parlour, you would think the war was on
If you knew Susie, like I know Susie
Oh! Oh! What a girl!",If You Knew Susie,1993
Fanny Brice,"I was strolling out one evening by the silvery moon
I could hear somebody singing a familiar tune
So I stopped a while to listen
Not a word I wanted to miss
It was just somebody serenading something like this

[Chorus]
Mandy
There's a minister handy
And it sure would be dandy
If we'd let him make a fee
So don't you linger
Here's the ring for your finger
Isn't it a humdinger?
Come along and let the wedding chimes
Bring happy times
For Mandy and me

There will be some jubilation for the happy pair
Yes, the best in all creation, joy is in the air
There'll be music at the station
For to speed them on their way
There will be some celebration on their wedding day

[Chorus]

Oh, what a wonderful day
Cupid, the parson, he'll say

I'm feeling kind of nervous to hear the wedding service
Now we'll hear the wedding bells, soon we'll hear the baby yells

Wait just a minute, my dear
I have the ring, never fear

What a fine ovation from all of our relations

And Mandy and me",Mandy,1993

Margie, I'll tell the world I love you
Don't forget your promise to me

Days are never blue
After all is said and done
There is really only one Oh!

They say the sun
Comes up every morning

And if you listen carefully
The winds that ride
On the high tide
Whistle a melody

So the people started to sing
And that's how the
Surf gave birth untold to
California soul

California soul
When you hear the beat
You wanna pat your feet
And you've gotta move cause

It's really such a groove
Puts a brand new kind of
Thinking in your mind
And you can't go wrong

'Cause you're happy all day long

But it still didn't seem complete
Until they saw two lovers kissing
They knew just what was missing
So happy they were

Que mis ojos son estrellas 
Que mi risa es la más bella 
Que todos mis atributos son perfectos para él

Que si fuera un buen artista

que termina un gran desvelo 
una inmensa ola que al pasar 
lleva de regreso al mar 
tantas huellas tristes 
que dejamos tu y yo 

y la verdad es que no muere 
porque yo al tocar tu mano 
siento que es como si fuera esta la primera vez 
y la verdad es que se puede 
porque cuando tu me miras 
siento que es que yo contigo 
vuelvo a ser quien quiero ser

y es que con tu amor se puede 
llegar al otro lao del rio 
y navegar por las corrientes 
que a tu lado se vencen

Fanny Lú,"Te seguí hasta la luna
Olvidando atrás todo
Por no verte partir

Empaque mis maletas
Regale alguna ropa
Pa' poderte seguir

Me subí en un avión
Traspase las fronteras
Por llegar junto a ti

Y fue sin darme cuenta
Poquito a poquito
Te acostumbraste a mi
No me diste por hecho
Y te vi en el despecho
Por no saber compartir

Y ahora te dejo sin nada
Para que tu veas
Lo que estoy sintiendo
Dolida, desilusionada y
Hasta con rabia por perder el tiempo
Me siento tan restregada
Como un trapito de esos
Que están viejos
Te arrepentirás por que
Tu no diste todo lo que era
Te arrepentirás persiguiéndome
Esta vida entera

Te aguante hasta los lunes
Cuando te levantabas
Peleándole al mundo

Soporte hasta tus chistes
Pasados de moda y hasta
Ese traje inmundo

Me dedique a cuidarte
A sembrar mi cariño
En nuestro jardín
Y fue sin darme cuenta
Poquito a poquito
Te acostumbraste a mi

Fanny Lú,"No se que hacer para contarte
Lo que yo estoy sintiendo desde que te vi llegar un día a mi vida
No se como disimular
Que tengo un alboroto que me pica poco a poco todo el día

Quizás tan solo es de decirlo
O el llamar a algún amigo
Y confesarle mi secreto
Quizás sea mejor guardarlo
Alimentarlo y no entregarlo
Hasta que no pueda aguantarlo ni un segundo no mi amor

Que si te digo la verdad
Tan solo quiero de tu boca
Que me digas que tu amor es como el sol que me ilumina
Que ya no quiero aparentar
Tan solo quiero contemplarte
Como luna que se cuelga en tu balcón muriendo el día

Y si te digo la verdad
Voy a escribir todos mis versos
Que te tengo por decir para entregarte vida mía
Que ya no me quiero aguantar
Te vas a tener que enterar
Que mis latidos tienen dueño para siempre en tu guarida*

Cayo la luz que alumbra el día
Y empieza mi delirio por querer que ya amanezca para verte
La noche es larga sin tenerte
Y paso en mi desvelo suspirando una caricia pa' quererte

Quizás no tengo que esperar
Te lo repito sin cesar
Entenderás lo que yo siento
No tengo más con que abreviar
Mi corazón se va a estallar
Por retenerte todo el tiempo aquí en mi mente si mi amor

Que si te digo la verdad
Tan solo quiero de tu boca
Que me digas que tu amor es como el sol que me ilumina
Que ya no quiero aparentar
Tan solo quiero contemplarte
Como luna que se cuelga en tu balcón muriendo el día

Guárdame siempre donde no haya frío
Arropa este amor que te tengo
Mírame a los ojos para hacerme mía
Y deja asi que yo te quiera, yo te quiera, si mi amor

Dame, dame cariño
Tiempo pa' estar contigo
Dame de tu boca, boca que provoca cada parte de mis sentidos

Dame, dame cariño
Tiempo pa' estar contigo
Dame tu respiro, quédate conmigo para amarte con mis latidos",Y Si Te Digo,2006
Fanny Lú,"Una y otra vez te di mi amor
Y sin querer fui traicionando mi destino
Sumergiendo el lirio e ilusión
Y fue la vida quien compró
La cuenta a mi favor

Cerré el capitulo final
Con una lágrima entrañada
Entre el alma y mi garganta
Cerré la puerta tras de ti
Me convencí que estar contigo
Es el camino para no llegar

No me vengas a decir que ahora te mueres por mi
Donde dejas el pasado yo quiero un amor sincero
No me hables del ayer no soy yo quien va a perder
Que es a mi a quien has amado no me vas a convencer
Que es a mi a quien has amado no me vas a convencer

Para amarte no hizo falta
Una receta complicada y adornada
Nomás un trago de ilusión
Fue suficiente para amarte apasionada

Cerré mi pobre corazón
Con la esperanza de tenerte
Sólo a ti en el universo
Cerré mi mundo para ti
Y ahora sé que estar contigo
Es el camino para no llegar

No me vengas a decir que ahora te mueres por mi
Donde dejas el pasado yo quiero un amor sincero
No me hables del ayer no soy yo quien va a perder
Que es a mi a quien has amado no me vas a convencer
Que es a mi a quien has amado no me vas a convencer

Sin ti no es imposible
Mi cuerpo lo resiste
Te has ganado mi corazón
El día en que te perdiste
Las cosas que me diste
Tomaron rumbo mejor

Dame un poquito corazoncito
Dame tu amor sincero
Dame de eso que es lo que yo quiero
Dame un trocito no tan chiquito

Dame tu amor sincero
Dame de eso que es lo que yo quiero
Dame de eso que es lo que yo quiero

No me vengas a decir que ahora te mueres por mi
Donde dejas el pasado yo quiero un amor sincero
No me hables del ayer no soy yo quien va a perder
Que es a mi a quien has amado no me vas a convencer

Dame un poquito nada más
Dame tu amor sincero
Dame de eso que yo quiero
Dame un trocito no tan chiquito

Dame tu amor sincero
Dame de eso que es lo que yo quiero

No estar contigo solo duele un poquitito
Y que me diga que aún me quiere
Yo ya no me trago nada de lo que el me tiene

Despues de todo lo sucedido
El no tiene nada de lo que yo había pedido
Y con el tiempo me he convencido
A mi corazón nunca le faltan los latidos

Tú y solo tú
Pelaste el cobre justo a tiempo
Pa' que no cayera yo
Afortunadas las que no comimos cuento

Mira que éste corazón
Mi pobre corazón ya no me duele
Lo enmendado de a poquito

Reparando éste rotito ya no me duele
Mira que éste corazón palpita al millón ya no te quiere
Ya te acordarás de mi al verme partir
Que un corazón herido es corazón perdido

Yo que pensaba que era contigo
Que merecía pasar el resto de mi vida
Hoy tengo claro que no es tan malo
Pasar la página y no tenerte a mi lado

Y ya sé que no te necesito
Estar tranquila es lo mejor y lo repito
Miro adelante sin que me espante
Y soy la reina fina y dulce como antes

Tú y solo tú
Pelaste el cobre justo a tiempo
Pa' que no cayera yo
Afortunadas las que no comimos cuento

Mira que éste corazón
Mi pobre corazón ya no me duele
Lo enmendado de a poquito

Reparando éste rotito ya no me duele
Mira que éste corazón palpita al millón ya no te quiere
Ya te acordarás de mi

Porque todas esas cosas
Que me hiciste y me dijiste
No pensaste y me mentiste
Y ya no creo mas en ti

Ya no importa nada
Ya no quiero más jugadas
Ni sonrisas empastadas
Eso sobra para mi

Mira que éste corazón, ja
Mi pobre corazón ya no me duele, ya no me duele
Lo enmendado de a poquito
Reparando éste rotito ya no me duele
Ay no me duele, no me duele

Mira que éste corazón palpita al millón ya no te
Quiere, na, na, na, na, na
Ya te acordarás de mi al verme partir
Que un corazón herido es corazón perdido
Ay, ay, ay, ay

Mira que éste corazón
Mi pobre corazón ya no me duele
Lo enmendado de a poquito
Reparando éste rotito ya no me duele
Ya no me quieres

En la tempestad abrigo

Siempre que tú estás conmigo

Siento éste dolor profundo
Ay, ay, ay, muere la ilusión
Y me alejo de éste mundo

Y ahora lloro por ti
Como un río que llega
A despojar en el mar
Y un sentimiento que quema

Como luz de una vela
Que muere en silencio
Y se lleva tu luz
Y ahora lloro por ti

Porque no puedo evitar
Que se me rompa la vida
Por quererte mostrar
Que a pesar que te has ido
Te llevo conmigo, y no quiero soltar

Sin tu amor no podría vivir
Yo podría perder camino
Comenzar no es la solución
Si hoy ya tú no estás conmigo

Como lluvia que opaca el Sol
Siento tu calor perdido
Quebranté la ventana azul
Que a tu patio había conseguido

Quizás no lo contemplé, nunca lo ví venir
Y hoy que te has ido, ya lo he sentido

No queda ni un latido aquí conmigo
Sólo quedan mil palabras
Que se quedaron sin decir

Un minuto más para decirte que no habrá nadie más
Que me llene el alma de grandeza
Que me haga suspirar de mil maneras
Se me llena el alma de tristeza tan sólo de pensar

Que no dije que te amaba tanto
Que no supe como demostrarlo
Que la vida se nos ha acabado
Y no sé recuperar un minuto más

Quizás nunca imaginé mis días sin ti
Quizás nunca mencioné lo que me hacía felíz
Y hoy que te has ido ya lo he sentido
No tengo ya motivos, ya no es lo mismo
Sólo quiero una oportunidad de volverte a sonreír

Fueron tantos los momentos junto a ti
En que me equivoqué, tantos gestos que retuve, tantos
No sé por qué y un minuto mas
Para decirte que no habrá nadie más
No sé por qué, por qué te fuiste de mi lado

No hace falta nada
Yo no pido ni fortuna

Más que amarte

Si romper las memorias
De un amor tan gigante
Que viviste junto a mi
Dime que vas a hacer
Yo te lo pido

Que yo no renuncio a quererte no, no, no
Si para estar contigo hace falta que yo vuele, volaré
Sólo pretendo tenerte no, no, no
Sin que se acabe el tiempo

Que yo me quedo contigo ahora y siempre
Y no me acostumbro a perderte no, no, no

No es suficiente una vida pa' quererte
Llévame pegaíto y dame tu cariño un poco más

Si me lo preguntas
No hice nada malo
Si quererte tanto
Es delito que me lleven ya

Y ya que no preguntas
Yo te digo ésto
No hay mujer que te ame
Tanto sin cesar

Y ahora no sabes si rendirte
Si luchar con las horas

Que mis ojos son estrellas 
Que mi risa es la más bella 
Que todos mis atributos son perfectos para él 
Que si fuera un retratista 
Que si fuera un buen artista 
Yo sería su Mona Lisa y hasta un tango de Gardel

Y aprendí a hacer males
Y a los dieciséis estrené los bares
Yo siempre pensé que no había más nadie
Y que lo podía todo sin asustarme

Yo siempre supe que hacer
Mi sexto sentido me parecía proteger
Ya no es lo mismo que ayer
Contigo pierdo el centro
Cambia mi forma de ser

Ya no puedo más
Te enrredaste en mi vida
Y me cambiaste
Mi forma de pensar

Ya no puedo más
Te enrredaste conmigo
Y te quedaste por siempre

Siempre que tú te vas, tú te vas
Siento que todo me falta
Y siempre que tú te vas
No vuelves más si yo estoy
Aquí esperando muy sentada

Y aunque tú parezca un tonto muy loco
Aaa me esta gustando poquito a poco
Yo que me sentía tan intocable
No me cambiaría por nada y nadie

Hoy ya no sé ni que hacer
He perdido ya mi juicio y mi propia ley
Ya no es lo mismo que ayer
Contigo pierdo el centro
Cambia mi forma de ser

Ya no puedo más

Y me cambiaste mi forma de pensar

Ya no puedo más

Siento que todo me falta

Queriendo sentirte cerca de mí
Nada mejor que yo pueda ser
Que estar junto a ti, estar junto a ti

Pongo en la balanza lo que tengo y yo misma me
Contengo de cantártelas mi amor

Encomendado y confesado hasta el rosario
Le he rezado a la virgencita del amor

Pero yo me convencí que más vale estar sola
Que engañada por ti…
Llorare yo sé que es así pero ten por seguro que
Que soy más fuerte sin ti…

Que soy más fuerte sin ti (ti ti ti ti ti ri ri ri)

Innecesario empezando por tu amor
Empeñe hasta el alma por quererte y resulta
Que mi suerte es que haya sido la mejor

Es que ahora sí que sabe amarme (fanfarrón)
Tantas promesas a  los santos que como saben
Fueron tantos pero ninguno me cumplió

Que no hay nada eterno

Something caught my eye
A growing epidemic
That really ain't fly
This middle aged lady
I gotta be blunt
Her spandex biker shorts
Were creeping up the front
I could see her uterus
Her pants were too tight
She musn't own panties
There were none in sight
She walked right by
The poor woman didn't know
She had a frontal wedgie

Girl that's gotta hurt
Take some time and adjust
Can't you see people staring
And making a fuss
Could not believe my eyes
Had to take a second glance
Is your crotch hungry girl?
Cause it's eating your pants
Do you enjoy the commotion
And attention it brings?
The only lips I want to see
Are the ones that sing
In public putting on
An X rated show
Grossing people out
With your Cameltoe

Uh Huh
Oh No

First day of spring and by the looks of things
These girls done forgot how to dress
A little too quick to wearin pum pum shorts
And it's causing me much distress
Whoomp there it is ya'll right in the front
Everybody come and get a good look
I can see everything through the panty cling
Every crannie and every nook
You better take a quick minute before you step outside
Check the area that's pubic
Or you'll get your panties all up in a bunch
All twisted up like rubic
Take these words of advice cause its not very nice
I want to put you all in the know

But a lot men would get with it
So I ain't gon' beg you no more

Ain't gon' beg you to love me
Ain't gon' beg you to hold me
Ain't gon' you to pick up and take me out
I ain't gon' beg you to ice me
Ain't gon' you to want me

Ran into an old friend yesterday
Caught me by surprise when he called my name
He was a familiar face, from a chapter in my past
Talked for a while, I smiled and then
Said that he was seeing somebody and
Told me this was gonna last
Showing me her photograph

And all the feelings I thought were gone
Came rushing back to me at once
Tried to smile and hide the way I felt
But I was thinking to myself

(Truth is) I never got over you
(Truth is) Wish I was standing in her shoes
(Truth is) And when it's all said and done
Guess I'm still I love with you
(Truth is) I never should have let you go
(Truth is) And it's killing me 'cause now I know
(Truth is) When it's all said and done
Guess I'm still I love with you

We reminisce on the way things used to be
Shared a couple laughs, and some memories
Talked about the things that changed
Some for good and some for bad
Then he said good-bye and he paid for lunch
Promised that we'd always keep in touch
Grabbed my bags and grabbed my thoughts,
Walked away and that was that

And all the feelings that I thought were gone
Came rushing back to me at once
Tried to smile and hide the way I felt
But I was thinking to myself

(Truth is) I never got over you
(Truth is) Wish I was standing in her shoes
(Truth is) And when it's all said and done
Guess I'm still I love with you

(Truth is) And it's killing me 'cause now I know
(Truth is) And when it's all said and done
Guess I'm still I love with you

Now the truth is it hurts but I that the faults mine
'Cause I let him go
Tried to get over it but it's messing with my mind
(Because I know)

(Truth is) I never got over you
(Truth is) Wish I was standing in her shoes
(Truth is) And when it's all said and done
Guess I'm still I love with you
(Truth is) I never should have let you go
(Truth is) And it's killing me 'cause now I know

Wake up in the morning with my man next to me 
Up all night like we been on that ecstasy 
Mixed wit Hennessey he got the remedy ya my nigga into me I can't say it simply 
We take a quick before the hour conversation 
Time ta have relation love making in the basement 
Smack it up flip it up crush it 
One minute two minute I was no question 
Who would ever think that I would be giving up the goodies 
Walking round naked in a pair of pink footies 
Just like them hoes at the shows 
Half dressed clothes doing whatever who knows, nah I only get freaky with him 
No menaja twas not freaky wit them, its just me and my man 
Yes simply me and my man

4 my man, ill do whatever
What I feel, this love it make me do things, make me things
My man, our loves forever
What I feel, this love, it won't never change

I'm never insecure when we not together 
Even tho he tell me he in love wit Ciara 
I'm from a new era and I bring terror to any chick who check my fella when we together 
So, he treat me like his Cinderella 
Protect me from the storm like he muh umbrella, this fella deserve I'm a stellar, he be a rockafella, not jay-z n dane but the charm on a chain 
He platinum, take a roll lick his forty, e backing? 
Hit a stack and keep tracking ill fax them 
If I can't find his ass and his ass outta gas he only gettin one pass 
Okay, my man, my man and nobody else's 
Damn right, I hope ya'll felt this 
Oh ladies round tha coasts 
Ya better get focused before you ever try to approach him

See when you in love you might have to fight 
Don't say you won't neva say you won't 
You might get real mad wanna act all bad act up in tha street 
A few chicks ya gotta beat 'cause they disrespect 
Clocking ya man from his feets to his neck 
Ya gotta let em know that's a no no 
Slap em real slow with a right blow which ever way you go but keep it gangsta 
Show these bitches that ya yank em, yank em point blank em top rank em

Fantasia,"What if I broke our monogamous agreement 
What if I told you I lied but didn't mean it 
What if my one mistake 
Had the potential to break 
Up our happy home 
Would you wanna know 
What if I confessed it and though she didn't mean nothing since it happened 
You're thinking about leaving 
What if I suppressed it 
And made a vow to never mess with another 
Is it cool for me to smother the facts 
Is it cool for me to cover my tracks 
If you'd never know 
Or would me not being honest hurt you more

Are there some things better left unsaid 
Or would you wanna know instead 
Hypothetically of course 
Are there some wars not worth fighting 
Some tears not worth crying 
Hypothetically of course 
What if this happened to you 
What would you want me to do 

Well what if I told you that I had a confession 
What if I said 4 years ago when we were arguing 
He came to comfort me and I wound up pregnant 
And I just can't say for sure 
If the baby's yours 
What if I confessed it and it turns out not to be your baby after you get tested 
And it destroys what we've been blessed with 
What if I suppress it 'cause technically you're the baby's daddy anyway 
Is it wrong for me to want you to stay 
Would you rather have me tear you away 
From the only family you know 
Or is this just too big a secret to keep it on the low 

Would you wanna know 
Would you wanna know 
Tell me what you'd do 
Would you walk away or would you stay 
Would you wanna know 
Would you wanna leave the past behind us

I stand with my head held high, I feel beautiful

Use to make me feel like I meant nothing in your life
Always gave all I had to you
And all I wanted was for you too

See me as pretty enough
See me as sexy enough, see me as good enough
But all I did was waste all my time
I woke up and open my eyes
I finally took back hold of my life

And I feel beautiful, beautiful, I feel beautiful, beautiful
You could not crush my soul, crush my soul
Nothing you can do to make you take away my right to feel
Beautiful, beautiful, I was down so low, down so low
But I won't be, won't be brought down anymore

Now I know I'm not, my worth is priceless
I got back my pride, I took back my life

Better see what the hits you give before you try to make a pitch
Recognize why it ain't you
Only reason why I’m takin' just can't everybody give me
'Cause it just ain't the way that I do

By the walk and the way I talk, I’m givin' you love
The game many I loss by making you fuss
Too many girls in the house with hearts strung out
Complain when they running they mouth but they like me

Sayin' just enough, I ain't gotta ever do

I ain't in it for the minute no pass lives and gimmicks

How long are the violins gonna play

I still get a flashback
Of the time I spent
Thinking you could be that one
Should I have just kept your love?

As I understand,
We don' had some good times
On the other hand,
Kept me crying all night
It was too much for my mind

So even though I left you
I can't forget you

It's bittersweet, it's bittersweet
Yes I'll always love you
It's bittersweet, it's bittersweet

When we were together
You ain't treat me right
Damn, I really loved ya
I ain't gonna lie

'Cause when I think about you

It's bittersweet

I still have a box
Full of things you gave me
Start to throw it out
Something always stops me, yeah
I'm not as over as I say

Deep inside my heart
I made the right decision
But it's kinda hard
When your mind is thinking of,
Did I make a big mistake?

When I think about you

See I have to understand
That, somebody is gonna get hurt
Out of this situation
And you just hope it's not you

At times
Part of me wants you, part of me don't
Part of me is missing you, part of me is gone
Part of me is saying that the love is still strong,
Part of me is letting go

Can't forget you

Soakin' wet
All stressed out and worried
Podunk, Missouri
And I don't know how or why or when
Her daddy left
But he drove off in a fury
She grew up in a hurry

Now skinny jeans and Maybelline
Make pretty girls do crazy things
Teenage tears and bathroom mirrors
Will stick with you throughout your years
Trust me, it's so so ugly

Picket fence, two car garage
The man that she don't love
But he makes six figures
She thought he'd fix her
But that iron gate feels more and more
Like an old bird cage than a way
To keep her out of danger
So she takes to liquor

Nor the champagne brunches and upper class shine
Can't keep a woman satisfied
Swimming pools and bows and braids
And the baby thinks her mom's a live-in maid
If you ask me, it's so so ugly

So give me a rusty old grain silo
Give me good food that sticks to my bones
Thank you for that good good man who loves me
With dirt on my hands and scrapes on my knees
The feeling at night when I wash it all clean
I'm telling you girls, it's a beautiful thing
Trust me, it's far from ugly

I sing my songs all across the country

Why don't you put some records on while I pour

I’ll take your hat, your hair looks swell

I ought to say no, no, no, sir (mind if I move in closer?)

My brother will be there at the door

My maiden aunt’s mind is vicious
Oh, your lips are delicious
Oh maybe just a cigarette more
Never such a blizzard before

I’ve got to go home (but baby, you’ll freeze out there)
Say, lend me your coat
It’s up to your knees out there
You’ve really been grand
I’m thrilled when you touch my hand (but don’t you see)
Darling how can you do this thing to me?

There’s bound to be talk tomorrow (think of my life long sorrow)
At least there will be plenty implied

The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song

Haunts my reverie

And candle lights on little corner tables

Silk stockings thrown aside dance invitations

Wild strawb'ries only seven francs a kilo

Just be my boy always and for all days
The first boy I've known to get straight A's
And appear in everyone of my high school plays
Mozart blasting from his Volvo
And there's tape on his glasses in charge of hall passes
Not the kinda guy I mostly been with
I go for thug or Abercrombie and Fitch
With a little bit of skater boi here and there
Not a guy who doesn't even show his underwear
When he sags his pants but I wanna go with him
To the school dance and have him be my date
But I'm afraid that he doesn't know how
To move and everybody would flip and have a cow
Now just because he brings his lunch packed this situation that I'm facing is jacked

I wouldn't call him fly suspenders and a bow tie
I wouldn't call him the man but he can still hang with the fan

Now this ain't the description I saw in my dreams
But they say nothing is quite like it seems
So even though you see his socks when he walks
And his pants are so tight circulations cut off
I think I should give him a chance and ignore his metal braces and tight pants
But my friends disagree they disapprove of my plans to make a move
But it would behoove me
To not pay attention to them My friends
Just don't understand just cause he's not the man
They try to act hard now pretend like they floss
We'll see who's laughing when my geek is their boss
Maybe he doesn't have experience with dates
But I bet the same thing happens to Bill Gates
So even though he doesn't have Sean Jean or Gerbauds
