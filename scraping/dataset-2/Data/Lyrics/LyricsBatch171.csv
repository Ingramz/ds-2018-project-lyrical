Dottie West,"You were mine for just a while
Now you're puttin' on the style
And you've never once looked back
To your home across the track

You're the gossip of the town
But my heart can still be found
Where you tossed it on the ground
Pick me up on your way down

Pick me up on your way down
When you're blue and all alone
When their glamor starts to bore you
Come on back where you belong

You may be their pride and joy
But they'll find another toy
Then they'll take away your crown
Pick me up on your way down

They have changed your attitude
Made you haughty and so rude
Your new friends can take the blame
Underneath you're still the same

When you've learned these things are true
I'll be waiting here for you
As you tumble to the ground
Pick me up on your way down

Pick me up on your way down
When you're blue and all alone
When their glamor starts to bore you
Come on back where you belong

You may be their pride and joy
But they'll find another toy
Then they'll take away your crown
Pick me up on your way down",Pick Me Up on Your Way Down,1967
Dottie West,"Last night all alone in a barroom met a man who set my heart awhirl
He had a smile on his lips and coal black hair and eyes that would tempt any girl
Then he came and sat down at my table and as he placed his warm hand in mine
I found myself wanting to hold him for temptation was flowin' like wine
And I was almost persuaded to strip myself of my pride
Almost persuaded to push my conscience aside
Then we danced and he whispered I need you come with me let me be your man
Then I looked into his eyes and I saw it the reflection of my wedding band
And I was almost persuaded to let strange lips lead me on
Almost persuaded but your sweet love made me stop and go home",Almost Persuaded,1967
Dottie West,"It sure gets lonely alone no one to talk to alone
Nights sure get longer since you're gone don't keep me lonely too long
I need your arms to hold me and hear you say you need me
Don't let me live on dreams alone don't keep me lonely too long
Mem'ries are bad on one so lonely
My tortured heart cries out because it loves and wants you only
Yes I'm so lonely alone afraid of being all alone
Without your love I can't go on don't keep me lonely too long
Without your love I can't go on don't keep me lonely too long




",Don't Keep Me Lonely Too Long,1967
Dottie West,"No one to cry to no one to kiss goodnight no one to tell my troubles to
No one to sigh to no one to hold me tight no one to cheer me when I'm blue
I go home to my lonely room and find there's no one there
And each night I think of you please answer this one prayer
And give me someone to cry to someone to say I do someone to whisper I love you
(No one to cry to)

(No one to tell my troubles to)
I go home to my lonely room and find there's no one there
And each night I beg of you please answer this one prayer
Someone to cry to someone to say I do someone to whisper I love you
(No one to cry to)",No One to Cry To,1967
Dottie West,"I reached out my arms and I touched you with soft words I whispered your name
I held you right on the tip of my fingers oh but that was as close as I came
My eyes had a vision of sweet lips yielding beneath my command
I had your love on the tips of my fingers but I let it slip right through my hands
Yes I let it slip right through my hands
Somebody took you when I wasn't looking and I should have known from the start
Well it's a long long way from the tip of my fingers
To the love that's hidden deep in your heart to the love hidden deep in your heart
Yes somebody took you",Tip of My Fingers,1967
Dottie West,"If she brings you happiness then I wish you both the best
It's your happiness that matters most of all
But if she ever breaks your heart if the teardrops ever start
I'll be there before the next teardrop falls
Though it hurts to let you go darling I want you to know
And I'll stand by you if you'll ever call
And if I should ever hear that she made you shed a tear
I'll be there before the next teardrop falls
I'll be there anytime you need me by your side
To dry away every teardrop that you cried
If she ever leaves you blue just remember I love you
And I'll be there before the next teardrop falls
Yes I'll be there before the next teardrop falls




",Before the Next Teardrop Falls,1968
Dottie West,"In the chilly hours and minutes of uncertainty
I want to be in the warm hold of your lovin' mind
Feel you all around me and to take your hand along the sand
Ah, but I may as well try and catch the wind

When sundown pales the sky I want to hide a while behind your smile
And everywhere I'd look your eyes I'd find
For me to love you now would be the sweetest thing that'd make me sing
Ah, but I may as well try and catch the wind

When rain has hung the leaves with tears I want you near to kill my fears
To help me to leave all my blues behind
Standing in your heart is where I want to be and long to be
Ah, but I may as well try and catch the wind

Ah, but I may as well try and catch the wind
",Catch the Wind,1968
Dottie West,"I was all right for a while I could smile for a while
But I saw you last night you held my hand
So tight as you stopped to say hello
You wished me well you couldn't tell that I'd been

Crying over you, crying over you
Then you said so long left me standing all alone
Alone and crying, crying, crying, crying
It's hard to understand that the touch of your hand can start me crying

I thought that I was over you but it's true, oh so true
I love you even more than I did before
But darling what can I do
You don't love me and I'll always be crying

Crying over you, crying over you
Yes now you're gone and from this moment on
I'll be crying, crying, crying, crying
Yes crying, crying over you",Crying,1968
Dottie West,"Today I sat alone at my window
And I watched our little boy outside at play
With the little girl next door like so many times before
But something didn't seem quite right today

So I went outside to see what they were doing
And then the teardrops came my eyes would lame
'Cause I heard him name the game and I hung my head in shame
When I heard our little boy say to her

I don't wanna play house I know it can't be fun
I watched mommy and daddy and if that's the way it's done
I don't wanna play house it makes my mommy cry
'Cause when she played house my daddy said goodbye

I don't wanna play house I know it can't be fun
I watched mommy and daddy and if that's the way it's done
I don't wanna play house it makes my mommy cry
'Cause when she played house my daddy said goodbye",I Don't Wanna Play House,1968
Dottie West,"If time were not a moving thing
And I could make it stay this hour
The love we share will always be
There'd be no coming day
To shine a morning light
Make us realize all night it's over

When you walk away from me
There is no place to put my hand
Except to shade my eyes against the sun
That rises over land

I watch you walk away somehow
I have to let you go, now it's over
If you knew just how I really feel
You might be turning yet

There are so many times that people
Have to love and then forget
Though there might have been a way
I have to force myself to say it's over

So I turn my back and turn my hair to the wind
Move along in silence, trying not to think at all
I send my feet before me walk
The silence street before me it's over

If time were not a moving thing
It's over",It's Over,1968
Dottie West,"Hold back the rushing minutes, make the wind lie still
Don't let the moonlight shine across the lonely hill
Dry all the raindrops, hold back the sun
The world has ended, my baby's gone

I'll wake up almost every night and realize you're gone
I'll toss and turn and stare at darkness, waiting for the dawn
I try to tell my lonely heart, we'll make it alone
But it cries the world has ended, oh, my baby's gone

Hold back the rushing minutes make the wind lie still
Don't let the moonlight shine across the lonely hill
Dry all the raindrops, hold back the sun
Don't they know the world has ended, my baby's gone
Don't they know the world has ended, oh, my baby's gone",My Baby's Gone,1968
Dottie West,"The cattle are prowlin' and the coyotes are howlin'
Way out where the doggies bawl
Where spurs are jinglin', my cowboy is singin'
His lonesome cattle call

He rides in the sun till his day's work is done
And he rounds up the cattle each fall
Hmm, singin' his cattle call

For hours he will ride on the range far and wide
When the night wind blows up a squall
His heart is a feather in all kinds of weather
He sings his cattle call

He's brown as a berry from ridin' the prairie
As he rounds up the cattle each fall
Hmm, singin' his cattle call",Cattle Call,1969
Dottie West,"How many arms have held you
And hated to let you go?
How many, how many I wonder?
But I really don't want to know

How many lips have kissed you
And set your soul aglow?
How many, how many I wonder?
Oh, I really don't want to know

So always make me wonder
Always make me guess
And even if I ask you
Sweetheart, don't confess

Yes, just let it remain your secret
Cause darling, I love you so
And it's no wonder, no wonder, I wonder
But I really don't want to know
Honey, I really don't want to know",I Really Don't Want to Know,1969
Dottie West,"You give your hand to me and then you say hello
And I can hardly speak my heart is beating so
And anyone can tell you, think you know me well
But you don't know me

No you don't know the one who dreams of you each night
Longs to kiss your lips and longs to hold you tight
To you I'm just a friend that's all I've ever been
You don't know me

I never knew the art of making love
Though my heart aches with love for you
Afraid and shy, I let my chance go by
The chance you might have loved me too

You give your hand to me and then you say goodbye
I watch you walk away through these tear dimmed eyes
You'll never never know the one who loves you so
You don't know me

You give your hand to me and then you say goodbye
I watch you walk away through these tear dimmed eyes
You'll never never know the one who loves you so
You don't know me",You Don't Know Me,1969
Dottie West,"I've had nothing but sorrow
Since you said we were through
There's no hope for tomorrow
How's the world treating you?

Every sweet thing that mattered
Has been broken in two
All my dreams have been shattered
How's the world treating you?

Got no plans for next Sunday
Got no plans for today
Every day is blue Monday
Every day you're away

Though our pathways have parted
To your memory I'm true
Guess I'll stay broken-hearted
How's the world treating you ?

Are you turning and yearning
Do you ever get through
Do you think of returning
How's the world treating you ?

Every sweet thing that mattered
How's the world treating you?
And IÃ¢??m asking you darling
How's the world treating you?",How's the World Treating You,1969
Dottie West,"I love you because you understand, dear
Every single thing I try to do
You're always there to lend a helping hand, dear
But most of all I love you 'cause you're you.

No matter what the world may say about me
I know your love will always see me through
I love you for the way you never doubt me
But most of all I love you 'cause you're you.

I love you because my heart is lighter
Every time you're walking by my side
I love you because the future's brighter
The door to happiness you've opened wide.

No matter what may be the style or season
I know your heart will always be true
I love you for a hundred thousand reasons
But, most of all I love you 'cause you're you.",I Love You Because,1969

All the bees are makin' honey oh the lovin' season is on
Got all the ambition got a sweet deposition
Baby I've been wishin' you will gonna catch me before the lovin' season is gone
Well I've got nothing but time to try to win your love
Oh baby you're on my mind and you're the only thing I've been thinking of
Well I'm taking my stand I try as hard as I can

Dottie West,"Sweet dreams of you
Every night I go through
Why can't I forget you and start my life a new
Instead of having sweet dreams about you

You don't love me, it's plain
I should know you'll never wear your ring
I should hate you the whole night through
Instead of having sweet dreams about you

Sweet dreams of you
Every night I go through
Why can't I forget you and start my life a new
Instead of having sweet dreams about you",Sweet Dreams,1969
Dottie West,"The worst that I've ever been hurt 
In my life 
The first time I ever have 
Wanted to die 
Was the night when you told me 
You loved someone new 
And you asked me if I could forget 

When I stop dreaming 
That's when I'll stop loving you 

You may teach the flowers 
To bloom in the snow 
You may take a pebble 
And teach it to grow 
You may teach all the raindrops 
To return to the clouds 
But you can't teach my heart 
To forget",When I Stop Dreaming,1969
Dottie West,"I want to tell you all a story 'bout a Harper Valley widowed wife
Who had a teenage daughter who attended Harper Valley Junior High
Well her daughter came home one afternoon and didn't even stop to play
She said, ""Mom, I got a note here from the Harper Valley P.T.A.""

The note said, ""Mrs. Johnson, you're wearing your dresses way too high
It's reported you've been drinking and a-runnin' 'round with men and going wild
And we don't believe you ought to be bringing up your little girl this way""
It was signed by the secretary, Harper Valley P.T.A.

Well, it happened that the P.T.A. was gonna meet that very afternoon
They were sure surprised when Mrs. Johnson wore her mini-skirt into the room
And as she walked up to the blackboard, I still recall the words she had to say
She said, ""I'd like to address this meeting of the Harper Valley P.T.A.""

Well, there's Bobby Taylor sittin' there and seven times he's asked me for a date
Mrs. Taylor sure seems to use a lot of ice whenever he's away
And Mr. Baker, can you tell us why your secretary had to leave this town?
And shouldn't widow Jones be told to keep her window shades all pulled completely down?

Well, Mr. Harper couldn't be here 'cause he stayed too long at Kelly's Bar again
And if you smell Shirley Thompson's breath, you'll find she's had a little nip of gin
Then you have the nerve to tell me you think that as a mother I'm not fit
Well, this is just a little Peyton Place and you're all Harper Valley hypocrites

No I wouldn't put you on because it really did, it happened just this way
The day my Mama socked it to the Harper Valley P.T.A.

You're not an angel
You're a woman

In the lives that we planned

Dottie West,"Sometimes it's hard to be a woman
giving all your love to just one man.
You'll have bad times
And he'll have good times, 
Doin' things that you don't understand.
 
But if you love him you'll forgive him,
even though he's hard to understand.
And if you love him Oh be proud of him,
'Cause after all he's just a man.  
 
Stand By Your Man,
Give him two arms to cling to,
And something warm to come to 
when nights are cold and lonely.

And show the world you love him.
Keep giving all the love you can;

Dottie West,"I am a lineman for the county 
And I drive the main road
Searchin' in the sun for another overload
I hear you singing in the wires 
I can hear you through the whine
And the Wichita lineman is still on the line

I know I need a small vacation 
But it don't look like rain
And if it snows that that stretch down south 
Won't ever stand the strain

Dottie West,"Don't get no attention from the people on the street
They don't even notice us they just step right on our feet
Just two unnoticed people in this great big world are we

But I got you and you got me and if they look they can see that we don't care
I got you and you got me baby that's all we will ever need

And so I'm right back where I've really always been
I got over you just long enough to let my heartache mend
And then today I started loving you again

But thanks for tryin' hard to answer all my questions just the same
Thanks for thinking that much of me
But most of all baby thanks for tryin' so hard to love me

Thank you baby for never promising thanks you couldn't give
For never lie just make yourself look good

You sign your name
Today at five 
I'll be on that train
And you'll be free
And I'll be alone

If you think 
We can't find the love we once knew
If you think 
I can't make everything up to you
Then I'll be gone

Can you take good care of Jenny
Can you take her to school everyday
Can you teach her how to play
All the games that little girls play
Hear what I say
Can you teach her how to roll up her hair
Can you make sure each night that she says her prayers
Well if you can do all these things
Then maybe she won't miss me
Maybe she won't miss me

And tonight as you laid in that big lonely bed
And you look at that pillow 
Where I laid my head
With your heart on fire
Will you have no desire 
To kiss me
Or to hold me

And if you can forget 
The good times we had
If you don't think 
They out weigh the bad

Along with the sunshine, there's gotta be a little rain sometimes
When you take you got to give, so live and let live or let go
I beg you pardon, I never promised you a rose garden

I could promise you things like big diamond rings
But you don't find roses growing on stalks of clover
So you better think it over
When it's sweet talking you could make it come true
I would give you the world right now on a silver platter
But what would it matter

So smile for a while and let's be jolly
Love shouldn't be so melancholy
Come along and share the good times while we can
I beg you pardon, I never promised you a rose garden
Along with the sunshine, there's gotta be a little rain sometimes

I beg you pardon, I never promised you a rose garden
I could sing you a tune and promise you the moon
But if that's what it takes to hold you, I'd just as soon let you go
But there's one thing I want you to know

Look before you leap, still waters run deep
And there won't always be someone there to pull you out
And you know what I'm talking about

Dottie West,"Beneath this snowy mantle cold and clean
The unborn grass lies waiting
For its coat to turn to green

And speaks to me of flowers

Anything that it would tell me
That's the thing that I would do

For the thing that I want most in life's
The thing thing that I can't win

That he'll only break me heart again
Should I decide to stay
So little snowbird take me with you
When you go
To that land of gentle breezes

Dottie West,"Busted flat in Baton Rouge
Waitin' for the train
Feelin' nearly faded as my jeans
Bobby thumbed a diesel down
Just before it rained
Rode us all the way to New Orleans
I pulled my harpoon out of my dirty red bandanna 
And was playing soft
While Bobby sang the blues
With them windshield wipers slappin' time 
I was holdin' Bobby's hand in mine
We sang every song that driver knew
Freedom's just another word for nothin' left to lose
Nothin' ain't worth nothin' but it's free
 
Feelin' good was easy, Lord, 
When he sang the blues
And feelin' good was good enough for me
Good enough for me and Bobby McGee
 
From Kentucky coal mines
To the California sun
Bobby shared the secrets of my soul
Through all kinds of weather, Lord
Through everything I done
Bobby baby kept me from the cold
Then somewhere near Salinas, Lord
I let him slip away
Lookin' for the home I hope he'll find it
And I'd trade all of my tomorrows
For one single yesterday
Holdin' Bobby's body next to mine
Freedom's just another word for nothin' left to lose
Nothin' left is all that Bobby left me
 
Feelin good was easy, Lord
When he sang the blues
And buddy, that was good enough for me
Good enough for me and Bobby McGee",Me and Bobby McGee,1971

There's a truck out on the four lane, a mile or more away
The whining of his wheels just makes it colder

He's an hour away from ridin'
On your prayers up in the skies
Ten days on the road are barely gone
There's a fire softly burning supper's on the stove

Sometimes this old farm feels like a long lost friend
Yes and hey, it's good to be back home again

And what's the latest things the neighbors say
And your mother called last Friday, sunshine made her cry

Hey, it's good to be back home again
Sometimes this old farm feels like a long lost friend
Yes and hey, it's good to be back home again

And feel your fingers feather soft on me
The kisses that I live for the love that won't go away

And I sleep to the sounds of whip-o-wills
My day is made with puppies and kittens meadows and daisies

Running over hills playing in the woods free breezes blowing
Honey bees are swarming, black birds are flying, wonder where they're going
Picking stick-me-tights off my gingham dress darkness is falling
Firewood to carry eggs to gather and supper?s ready mamma's calling

Or one I find pain and next time I find pleasure,
I wont pay attention to the haters now or never,

Think in it's myself why the hell it's with that guy,
Why she isn't by my side,we would be so fly,
We would live that life,
The life we used to dream, talked back then,
Back when I used to pull my BMX up along to your swing,
See here we are again,
Funny how faith brought my fame up along side of your Benz
And still

I was out with my girlfriend,
You were there with your boyfriend

We talked and laughed about
The friends of the past
How we wish then,
The days would last

You sat next to me and
I brushed up beside you
I wanted to touch you,
But I knew that I couldn’t
You wanted to touch me,
You told me that later,
But nothing happened

So tell me baby,
Where do we go from here,
You want me and I want you

I want you 
I want you 
I want you 
I want you 
I want you 
I want you 
I want you",Mountain,2012
Double Fuzz,"Who’s that gal you’ve been seeing around town
Does he make you feel the grown up girl you are now
Does he touch you in those places I can now
Can he take you to a higher place somehow

Did he take you home
Did he take you home 
Did he take you home 
Did he take you home, girl
Did he take you home, girl


Does it make you happy that I ain’t around you now?
Was it too hot to always be feeling down?
But the grass is always greenest on the other side
Don’t let go, I wont reach out ‘till you let another one down

Did he take you home
Did he take you home 
Did he take you home 
Did he take you home, girl
Did he take you home, girl

Do you lie awake thinking of me at night?
Thinking of how I used to touch your body so right
I wish that I could just take you home just one more time
Take you home and make you scream my name all night

Can I take you home
Can I take you home
Can I take you home

Tryin' to get cash out the ass like a stripper

Dub O, I'm down for whateva, do what I gotta to get the chedda
Fuck takin' over cities, we conquered galaxies and better
I was put here to crush CD's and wreck tapes
Make a false move, I put this whole fuckin' planet in checkmate
Hell with this, we takin' over the spot
I don't like to, but I will resort to the glock
The whole camp is sick, you can't do nuttin but like it
It's like when you drown, your ass sink quicker if you fight it
Talkin' bout you used to rob niggaz with pump shotties
I know you love club music nigga, but you ain't got a jack in your body
You fake ass niggaz, gettin' screened like a short pass
And if you incorrect, I'ma diamond cut your bastard ass
You got mind control over me like Deebo but you ain't my friend

But we gonna do it how you want cause I'm widdit to brawl with you

Hop out a cab or two to your avenue to battle you
Your style get ate like italian steak
Then I get Red to sell you achey or a pound of shake
Y'all can open up wide and suck this dick
None of y'all niggaz can't fuck with Bricks
While you scrubbin' dishes, we puffin Swishers
Fuckin' women ends up in the Benz trunk with switches
We cop sixty-three nigs
One from every spot, blunts be mystery mix
We got, spots, all my niggaz stay in Bricks
While y'all stash clips in bags of Bar-B-Q potato chips
Plus your main honey loved us
Slip her some bom-ba she'll fuck twenty of us

Yo, you pack that little ass gun like Harlem Nights
After we brawl and fight, yo bitch I'ma ball tonight
At shows we so tight we flow like it's one mic
Raw underground, yo Don, tell em what that dough like

D. Don, I gets mine, and stay gettin' it

It's bone-afficial my nizzle
D-Don got issues, and a type team that dismiss you
Oh boy! I gets more +Chips+ than +Ahoy!+
I got toys that deploy, I just aim and destroy
I keeps it gully in a bonafide skully
I ain't never had a hit but still get props like Nelly
I'm platinum in streets I got, love in the streets
And I'm more underground than your, basement concrete
Braids in my hair, gold still in my teeth
Still, bringin the beef if you're, bringin me grief
I, rat-a-tat-tat it like one-two one-two
Cock my shit back and let off on your whole crew
I'm Brick City baby twenty-fo'/seven
A project nigga that's, tryin to see heaven
I done ran through hell with gasoline drawers on (AOWW!)
I'm the portrait of a hustler, and once again it's on
I still got money buried in my back yard
I'm Bumpy like Johnson, they call me D-Don
My shit's so dope when you smoke you nod
And I spit that shit that leave you holy like the song

[Pacewon]
Yo.. we from the place where they pump out D and steal cars
Kids wild wave at you and smile you feel large
like they cut, and you got the power to heal scars
Never down cause the underground crown is still large
See I rap for a livin, probably rap 'til I die
If you dope, where you been at? Your raps is a lie
I'm all real, the one, the raw deal
Do tour, come home, do a flick for four mill'
What the hardcore heads on the block would call ill
Never catch me at the ball-out spot with small bills
Innovative rapper, rhyme in new ways
When I spit niggaz cough up blood for two days
Never catch me with material girls, they fugaz'
Rather bounce with a short chickenhead in blue shades
'Til the day I'm rich like Bruce Wayne
I'ma kick raps like pimps blew game
Ridin through your block with six new chains on
Pullin over droppin H-bombs
No doubt I got it locked Sanford Ave. to Penn Station
Chancellor to Central a thousand men waitin

[Chorus - 2X w/ minor variations]
Jersey that's whassup (whassup yo?)
You heard me light the Dutch (smokin weed)
Rock on like what the fuck (what the fuck?)
Jersey that's whassup, Brick City

[Roz]
Fuckin with me is a close call out of my crew
Don't try it I fuckin roast why'all, you and your co-stars
Next up to bat, I done had enough of cats
Blast tracks like what the fuck was that?
Roz spit rawness
State to state, hood streets and block corners
Rhymes hold so much weight, the feds on us
Lot of niggaz didn't want to see me last
But I won't stop just slow down like Easy Pass
Back up and give the are room
Or we gon' brawl worse than cartoons in bar rooms
In my city they don't pop they collar
Cats that do, get shot drop and holla
I'm from the be	-are-I, see-K-S
And my, squad is hot, any beef they bless
Any, squad that test gon' meet they death
Ask yourself, do you really need that stress?

[Shooga Bear]
Aiyyo, I project my voice so it's right in the crowd
There's a sign at the door, no bitin allowed
Plus the blows that I throw bring a light in the sound
So whoever want the drama I'm invitin them now
Phenomenal shit, spit 'til my abdominal split
Plus combined lines so minds demolish a click
Still burn MC's like Everclear, never fear
With razor sharp skills so ill they, sever ears
Hard to the roots a hundred proof with no chaser
Scarves and some boots a hundred troops with chrome bangers
Now rock with me, I spray blocks with glock fifties
Still when I spit I flip like Spock sent me
And never gave a fuck what a rapper grossed
But if they, brag and boast I'ma clap the toast
why'all can analyze this, watch me paralyze clicks
And sabotage why'all, I ain't a fan of why'all shit

I'm a nasty ass disease, and now I got ya mouth celibate
I'm a direct descendant of Hannibal's elephants

It's Double O again, still runnin, still gunnin
It's like I got a cast-iron dick, I'm still cummin
Talkin that killer shit like you blood raw
And ain't even did ten minutes in the back of a squad car
Be big niggaz to they weak, I'm true to the streets
why'all niggaz is half-assed like one booty cheek
I'm (??), why'all is Swiss Miss
My camp'll make your army pull back like a slipped disc
It be the Bricks again, with me with them steel rods
It ain't right unless Shane, Tariq, and Raouf Nayim is involved
I did ery'thang from robberies to dope
And why'all just lie about it, like it's a big-ass joke
Playin like kids, I think you want me to spank you
Ninety-nine on the charts with a ship anchor on your ankle
And if you niggaz don't like what I say
I'm in Newark on Market and Hasley e'ry fuckin day

Late nights tryna write mums sayin' go sleep.
A king here music world at my own feet
Dealing with the mainstream thank the lord daily
I'm sincere and I've been from the start
Ask Dyl (Dizzee Rascal), ask Will (Wiley), man I've had it in my heart
So I drop tears cause everything's changed reminiscing them days tryna turn the page

Cause I've been around the world I've seen so many places,
Livin' the life I've worked so hard to make it,
Trading the world for money, stars, and power, living my life at 100 miles an hour.

I'm still loving you like it was the first time,
I'm still loving you like it was the first time

Whoa, whoa, and I will never leave ya
Whoa, whoa, and I will never leave ya

You must be joking, don't tell me that its over
I'm driving the scene forward I'm a chauffeur
Its open so come we all enter
Tired of being in the back now we're center
We're chosen but they're telling us we're selling out
All we wanna do is open doors man hear me out

Rain or shine, it's always here to stay.
All these years you and I've spent together.
All this, we just couldn't stand the weather.

We all deal with trials and tribulations.
Fear hangs the fellow that ties up his years.
Entangled in yellow and cries all his tears.

Learn to see them before we're too old.
Don't just take me for tryin' to be heavy.
Understand, it's time to get ready for the storm.

Nah baby, I'm not gonna be able to do it
I tried to take you serious before, and you blew it
You figured you was slick, dissin me for the next man
But when you heard he had a wife, it ruined your plans
Now you want to come back and act like it's all that
But I ain't tryin to hear it, cause you sound real wack
You got it over the first time, but that was the last time
I'll never make the same mistake again in a lifetime
You hooker, no way, no how, you're history
So let's keep it real, cause this ain't no mystery
You had it like a queen, livin lovely and lost me
Your props are at all-time low and you crossed me
I used to treat you good, take you shoppin and feed ya
But now I'm doin fine, and girlfriend, I don't need ya

I'm on a mission, and I need me a new girl
My last girl fronted fakin moves with Earl
But that was in the past, finsihed, over, and done with
Besides, I know this hottie, and she's on my tip
She told me I could call her when I wanted to check her
And all I had to do to knock her down was respect her
To think about it, gee, that would be cool
To have a girl that's independent, with a job and school
So we took it slow, then we started to grow
Without a worry in the world, goin right with the flow
Until she cracked my head when she asked me to marry her
And move into a crib in some suburbian area
I knew that this was just too good to be true
And what you're askin me to do, girl, I cannot do
You told me, ""No committments"", and you best stick to it
Oh baby, I'm not gonna be able to do it

To mingle with the ladies while their earrings jingle

Checkin out her profile to see if she got style
Cause if she ain't a 10, she ain't worth my while
I'm all about stickin and movin with the quickness
Forget the foreplay, and let's get down to business

But still I kept strokin till her boots were smokin
And left her on the bed with her legs wide open

He was lookin' for a soul to steal
He was in a bind
'Cause he was way behind
And he was willin' to make a deal

When he came upon this young man
Sawin' on a fiddle and playin' it hot
And the devil jumped
Up on a hickory stump
And said, ""boy, let me tell you what

I guess you didn't know it 
But I'm a fiddle player too 
And if you'd care to take a dare, I'll make a bet with you 

Now you play a pretty good fiddle, boy
But give the devil his due
I'll bet a fiddle of gold
Against your soul
'Cause I think I'm better than you""

And it might be a sin
But I'll take your bet
And you're gonna regret
'Cause I'm the best there's ever been""

Johnny, rosin up your bow and play your fiddle hard 
'Cause hell's broke loose in Georgia, and the devil deals the cards 
And if you win, you get this shiny fiddle made of gold 
But if you lose, the devil gets your soul

The devil opened up his case
And he said, ""I'll start this show""
And fire flew from his fingertips
As he rosined up his bow

Then he pulled the bow across the strings
And it made an evil hiss
And a band of demons joined in
And it sounded something like this

When the devil finished
Johnny said, ""well, you're pretty good, old son
But sit down in that chair right there
And let me show you how it's done""

He played Fire on the Mountain run boys, run

Chicken in a bread pan pickin' out dough
Granny, does your dog bite? No child, no

The devil bowed his head
Because he knew that he'd been beat
And he laid that golden fiddle
On the ground at Johnny's feet

Johnny said, ""Devil, just come on back
If you ever want to try again
I done told you once you son of a bitch
I'm the best that's ever been""

Doug Dillard,"Believe me when I tell you
I will try to understand
Believe me when I tell you
I could never kill a man
But to know that another man's holding you tight
Hurts me, little darling
Through the morning through the night
The bond has been broken
The promise you gave
The words that were spoken
I can not be your slave
But to know that the trust you had in me is gone
Hurts me, little darling
Through the nighttime through the dawn
I dreamed just last night you were there by my side
Your sweet loving tenderness
Easing my pride
But then I awoke and found you not there
It was just my old memory of how much I care
Believe me when I tell you
I will try to understand
Believe me when I tell you
I could never kill a man
But to know that another man's holding you tight
Hurts me little, darling

Doug Duke,"My heart is sad and lonely
For you I sigh, for you dear only
Why haven't you seen it
I'm all for you body and soul

I spend my days in longing
And wondering why it's me you're wronging
I tell you I mean it
I'm all for you body and soul

I can't believe it
It's hard to conceive it
That you'd turn away romance
Are you pretending
It looks like the ending
Unless I could have just one more chance to prove, dear

My life a wreck you're making
You know I'm yours for just the taking
I'd gladly surrender myself to you body and soul

Jack Frost nipping at your nose
Yule-tide carols being sung by a choir
And folks dressed up like Eskimos.

Everybody knows a turkey and some mistletoe
Help to make the season bright
Tiny tots with their eyes all aglow
Will find it hard to sleep tonight.

They know that Santa's on his way
He's loaded lots of toys and goodies on his sleigh
And every mother's child is gonna spy
To see if reindeer really know how to fly.

Hatred, anger, to one another
A problem like that you call the Ghostbusters
In emergencies that deal with reality
Makin' sure we all be free
So we can like or dislike, cause people who just might
Look so happy but feel so uptight
They can't handle the problem that they created

To build an establishment
For an evil magician on a mission in the pitchin position
And no condition, will stop him on the transition
Of makin' it in time, with the help of the slime

But you was just, happy when I seen you in the street
But now you're a killer, and you can't be beat
You used to dance at the parties now you can't move your feet
Because you're scared, that people might say you're weak
And it ain't nuttin' worse than a real fake brother
Yes it is, WHAT? A real fake sucka
And if this fits you money, then take your picture
And put it in the frame with your name and your shame
Cause your whole style, is nothin' but mad game
You can call me old school, but I'm no fool
Cause back then, at least we had a hip-hop rule
And the rule was you got to be original
But in ninety-three it seems originality
Is on the verge of becoming extinct to me
And some of you rappers just stink to me
And none of y'all really seem to think to me
About respect, or no type of dignity
And gettin pimped like a ho by the industry, so

Something tells Rick he's a fool
To let girls treat me so cruel
But never-the-less, Rick said ""You got me waiting""
Sitting in my car, waiting for yoooooooooou-ooh-ooh, lalalala

I got a girl, but I'm about to switch all that
Because my girl be trying to play me like the bitch all that
Shoot, clocked her daughter, for acting out of order
To impress a girl who to me knocked her out the water!
But because the kid swears love
Though when I see her friend its like the shit wears off
I don't bother, while she want to kiss and then cuss and full of hate
Get her friend?  Mission Impossible
Because she's the one the hon chose to boast to
The way that her and the bitch is so close to be a waste
So make music in my basement
Don't cut her off till I find a good replacement
One day I jumped in my Jeep, drove her to her friend's
house, cause the hon was sleeping over
My girl was acting fine, then the slime switched
want to diss, I said ""It's over you waste of time BITCH""
Tried to kiss her friend, twice then a third
She said ""Stop, Rick"", but didn't tell her friend a word
I went to bed, here come my girl touching me intently
Snuck out early, girlfriend wasn't acting as friendly as before
Because she swore a nigga hit her
""Well if you ain't love her why'd you go back to bed with her?""
But I didn't, now the hon badgering
I don't know, maybe it's me, maybe I'm imagining the love affair

(singing)
Got Rick sitting right here
Waiting for you my dear
Wondering if you're ever gonna show, you hoe

Another brother out for one thing, mistook him for
Steady relationship is what I'm really looking for
Sincerity, scoop the hon I done it
I said ""Being straight up, it's you I really wanted""
Though she fucked niggas with money like MAD
I still found myself wanting the honey quite bad
Loyal to her friend, though she wanted wood
Then we did it, boy that pussy was good
""But what if shorty finds out?""
Never be too clever
""Rick, she has to know if we're to ever be together""
Chill, then we started to button the strap and
Then my girl woke up, we acted like ain't nothing happened
Later on, my girlfriend stormed in
""We going to the supper club, some kid's performing
Bye, see you later"", 
Her girlfriend hot, then stopped living, Rick decide to follow
I'm outside of the club sipping a beer through the best can
Both sluts were sliding numbers to the next man
Contradicting of words being together
My girl, too, I should've known, birds of a feather
Back in my Jeep, about 4:11
Popped another can, looked up to the heavens
I'm a good man, in fact I know that I am
And I deserve a lady love, that's why I'm wondering why I'm...

(singing)
Sitting in my car, waiting for yoooooooooou-ooh-ooh, lalalala
Got Rick sitting right here
Waiting for you my dear
Wondering if you're ever gonna show, you hoe
Something tells Rick he's a fool
To let girls treat me so cruel
But never-the-less, Rick said, you got me waiting
Sitting in my car, waiting for yoooooooooou-ooh-ooh,
lalalala, lalalala, lalalala, lalalala

So you get my point son, 
you just don't trust no bitch, you know what I'm sayin?
""Okay, daddy, I understand""
Cause bitches ain't no good, you know what I'm sayin?
""Okay, I get your point""
Anyway, listen to this, check it out

1994, as the world gets trifer,
I'm wondering, the fuck I need a woman in my life for? (ya know)
Cause its like a nigga whole history
With you hoes been nothing but misery
First rater, five-one stood
Mad coke fiend though the bitch looked good
Met her at the fever
""What's going on, stranger?""
And like a fool took her in and tried to change her
I don't who I thought I's bluffing
That BITCH wasn't giving up that coke for nothing
""Oh you trying to dis, mister bougeois nigga
Yet back in the day, you used to smoke coke cigarettes too,
That type shit you ain't admitting""
Because, homegirl, I grew out of it, you didn't
Anyway, dead out of order
Came in with a sheepskin her ex-lover bought her
Who gave you that?
""My ex""
I said ""Who?""
Believe she had the nerve to say ""You can wear it too""

When I found strength to depart, I do
Withdrew, for something brand new
Someone who would be true
Yes I should find someone who would be true

(Singing)
Cause Ricky needs a love that's true
Truuuuuuuuuuue, oh dear, scooby dooby doo
Scooby doo doo

Then I met Sin,
Sweating the viking
A brown skinned fox, slim just like I like them
""What?  Sweating you?  Picture that, nerd.  Please""
Anyway, the bitch had herpes!  (you know)
Imagine me, the fool being the spouse
Doctor said I couldn't catch it unless I got aroused
Found out snooping in her bag what she got
Now why you ain't tell me?  You worthless slut!
""Because I loved you at the time and couldn't afford to""
You know homegirl should get the Oscar award for her lying
Anyway, stayed with the creep
One day, Sybil here, talking in her sleep
""Chris, wait,"" the bum bitch said
So loud till a motherfucker fell out the bed
Who the hell is Chris?  She putting up resistance
Until I caught her calling the nigga long distance
Had the nerve to dis patch loving
Boy am I lucky that I didn't catch nothing

When I found strength to depart, I do
Withdrew, for something brand new
Someone who would be true
Yes I should find someone who would be true

(Singing)
Cause Ricky needs a love that's true
Truuuuuuuuuuue, truuuuuuuuue
Indeed, I need a love that's true
It seems I need a love that's true
Oh dear, scooby dooby doo
Oh gosh, Scooby doo doo-ooh (doo-ooh)

Though happy I was free
The need for love was still in me
Got to the point where the need for it was killing me
Then I met short here, hanging with my cousin
Found out later how young the bitch was and
Though I done hit it and she opened up a world
And remind me of that song ""Go Away, Little Girl""
It had to end because the bitch weren't loyal, and spoiled
""That's because I had you pussy whipped royal""
You see the type of shit a nigga was gonna marry?
You see the type of attitude the BUM BITCH carry?
Like oil and water, impossible mixture
Then temper tantrums came into the picture
Yelling (ahhhh), carrying on bad and cursing
Complete embarrassment to The Ruler as a person
""Gimme shorts""
Ruler will not permit you
Then she goes wild, starts breaking up my furniture
Flirts too, excuse me, a whore
Like the world's worst groupie when I brought her on tour

So when I found strength to depart, I do
Withdrew, for something brand new
Someone who would be true
Yes I should find someone who would be true

(Singing)
Cause Ricky needs a love that's true
Truuuuuuuuuuue, truuuuuuuuue
Indeed, I need a love that's true
It seems I need a love that's true
Oh dear, scooby dooby doo
Oh gosh, Scooby doo doo
Ricky needs a love that's true-hoo-hoo",Sittin' in My Car,1995

Cashing checks, make sound effects
And after I'm finish rocking, Slick Rick is on next

Well, here's a little something that needs to be heard
Doug, I was walking downtown (Word Rick) word
(Sure) All along, no one to be wit
Step on the D-train, 205th
I saw a pretty girl (so)
So I sat beside her
Then she went roar, she was Tony the Tiger
I said, oh darn, there has been a mistake
Honey, my name's Slick Rick, not frosty flake
(Oh, golly wolly) She was raising hell
She said, um, my name is Maggie but you can call me Michelle

Here's a story bout a cutie, bout a rich, bout to ditch
I'm also known to fuck the beauty out a bitch! (Say what?)
Might not shoot you in front of group two
Run a boot, did I mention I'm also quite cute too?

[Doug E. Fresh]
Yo, yo, yo fashion and glamour is ammunition
Cats wishing to rip it like this, keep fishing
Your flow ain't long enough, strong enough
And record sales aren't (vocal scratching)

[Slick Rick]
Enough. Slang it on a phatter to a badder kid
Don't matter a bit, I had to shit, and boomerang
Inadequate
Chick got to storm
While other rapper cat' kettle go hot to warm
We Turn It ON

[Doug E. Fresh]
Yo, as we turn the heat, yo, yo, yo

[Slick Rick]
I bogard through, and then be screaming no hard screw
Hey go-cart crew, your checking out ""The Show Part 2""
A fellow I know, ""Is this supposed to sell?""
I hope, so well, I spoke, and this is what I tell white folk
I don't discriminate, don't lack the stimulant crack has
Battle story man, and I'll eliminate your wack ass
Backwards tactics, Show for act it
Me and Doug Fresh took over this rap shit
Flushes, so as usual tossers
Better give us our props as you're new school wusses
Good times, patch rhyming brought back
And all you other rappers that's trying to talk crap
I'm not the devil, but your worst nightmare
Sick of rebels, and none of you motherfuckers can
Reach the cat's level
Four motherfuckers got to storm
Other rapper cat' kettle go hot to warm
We Turn It ON, nigga

Nasir

Baby girl, won't you come and hold my hand
Won't you come and chill out with the Virgo
Hey girl, just come and hold my hand
Won't you come and just chill with the Virgo
We sipping on Merlot, you ain't got be my girl though
I drop you off at, Willoughby and Myrtle
Smash with the Virgo, ain't got to take your shirt off
You seen me convince your homegirl though

Plus she says her life is too hard
She says that she want to come and build with the God
Promise that she gon' play her part
Cause what I spit gets straight to her heart
And, she's damn fine, feet Hammertime, damn if I mind
Love is the bu-bubbling back of your waistline
I don't waste time, gotta GET GET ON IT
Just you and me, two glasses, sip on Patron and
in the club scene where I met Ms. Green Eyes
She walked by asking me, ""Are you Nas?""
Why? ""If you was I'd be totally TWI""
What's that? ""Totally with it, T.W.I.""
Ha ha, well, here I am, yep I'm the man
Bartender put a Cosmo in that girl hand
So, here we standing before I begin
Homegirl made a knot out of the cherry stem
Tongue skills, yeah I like that, now we on the right track
Straight to my Phantom, call Africa Black
Ever since then, she been yapping a track
Told her friends, now they hollering behind her back
Sing!


Now I was, so fresh and so fly in diamonds
When I stepped up in the club even my eyes was shining
Bling! A little cute thing said, ""What's yo' name?""
I put my necklace in her face and told her read the chain
Oh oh, so stuck up, told me shut the fuck up
Blow! Ludacris in the hoouse
The needle hit the record, they was playing this song
All the ladies hit the floor and it was EH EH ON
Live forever like Fame, let the Leroys dance
While I'm laid back chilling in my be-boy stance
Could be a little pop locking if your girl's top droppin
But watch for cock-blocking on my coochie stock options
But later for the ASSDAQ, throw 'em on the fast track
Make 'em swip swap Nasty N-A-S pass that
honey in the black cause I'm feeling her curves
He looked down at what I had and said WA WA WORD
Why only serve one when we can serve up two
Then at the bachelor's pad, doing what the Virgos do
And these women so shy but get loud undercover
So we can have sex but I can't be your lover
(buck buck buck buck buck buck)
Sing!


They got my voice for the record and my voice for the beat
Virgo proof baby run the streets
So let's go (let's go) let's go (let's go) for the beat

Swindlin', forgot the god above him
Finally, fan base trinklin' down to nothing
No concern for his estate, though, was yearnin' for a break
Bitter and evil, didn't learn from his mistake

I'm tired of transportation in the back of a hack
I'd love to hear the rhythm of the clicketty clack
And hear the lonesome whistle see the smoke from the stack
And pal around with the democratic fellows named Mac
Take me right back to the track Jack

Choo choo, choo choo, ch'boogie
Woo woo, woo woo, ch'boogie
Choo choo, choo choo, ch'boogie
Take me right back to the track Jack

You reach your destination but alas and alack
You need some compensation to get back in the black
You take a morning paper from the top of the stack
And read the situations from the front to the back
The only job that's open need a man with a knack
So put it right back in the rack Jack

Choo choo, choo choo, ch'boogie
Woo woo, woo woo, ch'boogie
Choo choo, choo choo, ch'boogie
Take me right back to the track Jack

I'm gonna settle down by the railroad track
Live the life of Reilly in a beaten down shack
So when I hear the whistle I can peep through the crack
And watch the train a-rolling when it's balling the jack
For I just love the rhythm of the clicketty clack
So take me right back to the track jack

Choo choo, choo choo, ch'boogie
Woo woo, woo woo, ch'boogie
Choo choo, choo choo, ch'boogie
Take me right back to the track Jack

Take me I'm heading for the station
Take me and I need some transportation
Take me so I reach my destination
Take me right back to the track jack

Take me yeah, I'll reach my destination

When you're gonna get drunk again

When he brought back good whiskey, beer and wine

That's right get it right

I thought I'd whoop it up a little bit, you know, have a little fun

Yeah, I understand
So I got me a half a pint about half past two
Now after I drank that you know what I wanted to do
Sleep

Uh, uh, then I got me a pint about half past four
I felt so good I went out and got me some more
I got me a quart
Oh, a quart

Yes about half past five, after I drank that
I didn't know whether I was dead or alive
You know Nomax, I think more dead than alive, son

When you gonna straighten up, I'll tell you one more time

When you're gonna get drunk again

Life can be a joy

I like a Gershwin tune, how about you?
I love a fireside when a storm is due.
I like potato chips, moonlight and motor trips,
How about you?
I'm mad about good books, can't get my fill,
And Franklin Roosevelt's looks give me a thrill.
Holding hands at the movie show,
When all the lights are low
May not be new, but I like it,
How about you?

I like Jack Benny's jokes.
To a degree.
I love the common folks.
That includes me.
I like to window shop on 5th Avenue.
I like banana splits, late supper at the Ritz,
How about you?
I love to dream of fame, maybe I'll shine.
I'd love to see your name right beside mine.
I can see we're in harmony,
Looks like we both agree

And so I face the final curtain
My friend, I'll say it clear
I'll state my case, of which I'm certain

I've lived a life that's full
I've traveled each and every highway
Oh, and more, much more than this
I did it my way

Regrets, I've had a few
But then again, too few to mention
I did what I had to do
And saw it through without exemption

I planned each charted course
Each careful step along the byway
But more, much more than this
I did it my way

Yes, there were times, I'm sure you knew
When I bit off more than I could chew
But through it all, when there was doubt
I ate it up and spit it out
I faced it all and I stood tall
And did it my way

I've loved, I've laughed and cried
Had my fill, my share of losing
And now, as tears subside
I find it all so amusing

To think I did all that
And may I say, not in a shy way
""Oh no, oh no not me
I did it my way""

If not himself, then he has naught

And the summer wind 

Like painted kites, those days and nights
They went flying by
The world was new
Beneath the blue
Umbrella sky 

Then softer than

One day, it called to you
I lost you to

Raised him on the banks of a river bed
On a houseboat tied to a big tall tree
A home for my papa and my mama and me

Already mama's cooking papa something to eat
At half past, papa he's ready to go
He jumps in his pirogue headed down the bayou

He's got fishing lines strung across the Louisiana Rivers
Gotta catch a big fish for us to eat
He's setting traps in the swamp catching anything he can
He's gotta make a living, he's a Louisiana man

Got 'em out drying in the hot, hot sun

Little baby brother on the floor that's Mack
Bren and Lin are the family twins
And big brother Ed's on the bayou fishing

On the river floats papa's great big boat
And that's how my papa goes into town
Takes him every bit of a night and a day
To even reach a place where the people stay

And I can hardly wait until tomorrow comes around
That's the day my papa takes his furs to town
Papa promised me that I could go
He'd even let me see a cowboy show

I told my pop I've gotta go again

We'll come back again but first there's work to be done""

Operator, won't you put me on through
I gotta send my love down to Baton Rouge
Hurry up, won't you put her on the line

Doug Kershaw,"""I'm the Sheik of Araby, 
Your love belongs to me.
At night when you're asleep 
Into your tent I'll creep.
The stars that shine above,
Will light our way to love.
You'll rule this land with me;",The Sheik of Araby [Sampler C.D.][*],2001
Doug Kershaw,"Well, at birth mom and papa called their little boy Ned
Raised him on the banks of a river bed
On a houseboat tied to a big tall tree
A home for my papa and my mama and me

The clock strikes three and papa jumps to his feet
Already mama's cooking papa something to eat
At half past, papa he's ready to go
He jumps in his pirogue headed down the bayou

He's got fishing lines strung across the Louisiana Rivers
Gotta catch a big fish for us to eat
He's setting traps in the swamp catching anything he can
He's gotta make a living, he's a Louisiana man
Gotta make a living, he's a Louisiana man

My Muskrat hides hanging by the dozens
Even got a lady mink, a muskrat's cousin
Got 'em out drying in the hot, hot sun
Tomorrow papa's gonna turn 'em into money

Well, they call mama Rita and my daddy Jack
Little baby brother on the floor that's Mack
Bren and Lin are the family twins
And big brother Ed's on the bayou fishing

On the river floats papa's great big boat
And that's how my papa goes into town
Takes him every bit of a night and a day
To even reach a place where the people stay

And I can hardly wait until tomorrow comes around
That's the day my papa takes his furs to town
Papa promised me that I could go
He'd even let me see a cowboy show

I saw the cowboys and Indians for the first time then
I told my pop I've gotta go again
Well, Papa said, ""Son we've got lines to run
We'll come back again but first there's work to be done""

He's got fishing lines strung across the Louisiana Rivers
Gotta catch a big fish for us to eat
He's setting traps in the swamp catching anything he can
Gotta make a living, he's a Louisiana man
Gotta make a living, he's a Louisiana man

Gotta make a living, he's a Louisiana man
Gotta make a living, he's a Louisiana man
Gotta make a living, he's a Louisiana man

What a rare mood I'm in!
Why, it's almost like being in love
 
There's a smile on my face

Doug LaBrecque,"When they begin the beguine
It brings back the sound of music so tender
It brings back a night of tropical splendor
It brings back a memory ever green

I'm with you once more under the stars
And down by the shore an orchestra's playing
And even the palms seem to be swaying
When they begin the beguine

To live it again is past all endeavor
Except when that tune clutches my heart
And there we are, swearing to love forever
And promising never, never to part

What moments divine, what rapture serene
Till clouds came along to disperse the joys we had tasted
And now when I hear people curse the chance that was wasted
I know but too well what they mean

So don't let them begin the beguine
Let the love that was once a fire remain an ember
Let it sleep like the dead desire I only remember
When they begin the beguine

Oh yes, let them begin the beguine, please make them play
Till the stars that were there before return above you
Till you whisper to me once more, ""Darling, I love you""
Then we suddenly know what heaven we're in
When they begin the, begin the, begin the beguine

When they begin the, begin the, begin the beguine
When they begin the beguine",Begin the Beguine [From Jubilee],2005

I ain't said a thing about that.
Sometimes I just like to wear my spurs,
And my old Mexican hat.

That we were down there.
And when we woke up, you had that weird tattoo,
And somebody had curled my hair.

Sparkled on a pug-nosed dream

There were questions in the eyes of other dancers
As we floated over the floor
There were questions but my heart knew all the answers
And perhaps a few things more

Now in a cottage built of lilacs and laughter
I know the meaning of the words ""Ever after""
And I'll always see polka dots and moonbeams
When I kiss the pug-nosed dream",Polka Dots & Moonbeams,

With toys made of wood and string
Lovers kissed and others laughed

Was a hot wind blowin' up from the south 
There were two eye's starin' in a pawnshop window 
A whiskey bottle lifted to his mouth

There was no moon shinin' on the Rio Grande 
A truck of migrants pulled through town 
The jukebox was busted at the bus depot 
When Haley's comet hit the ground

Well he blacked out all the windows in his bedroom 
He was talkin' to the ceiling and the walls 
Then he closed his eyes and hit the stage in 1955 
And the screams of the women filled the hall

Of someone who was famous long ago.""

And it's Waltzin' Matilda while the bagpipes play old Clare de Lune

She was a lady, she came down from Bergen she said
She spoke little English, they laughed and drank whiskey instead
In the mornin' he found it, a rose with a note on his plate
It said, ""meet me at midnight on the corner of St. Olav's Gate""

Crying in the night
The night goes into

Morning, just another day
Happy people pass my way
Looking in their eyes
I see a memory
I never realized 
How happy you made me, oh Mandy

Well you came and you gave without taking
And I sent you away, oh Mandy
And you kissed me and stopped me from shaking
And I need you today, oh Mandy

I'm standing on the edge of time
Walked away when love was mine
Caught up in a world of uphill climbing
The tears are in my eyes 
And nothing is rhyming, oh Mandy

Well you came and you gave without taking
And I sent you away, oh Mandy
And you kissed me and stopped me from shaking
And I need you today, oh Mandy

Yesterday's a dream
Now I face the morning
Crying on the breeze
The pain is calling, oh Mandy

Well you came and you gave without taking
And I sent you away, oh Mandy
And you kissed me and stopped me from shaking
And I need you today, oh Mandy

Well you came and you gave without taking

Doug Spartz,"My pappy said, ""Son, you're gonna' drive me to drinkin'
If you don't stop drivin' that Hot Rod Lincoln.""

Have you heard this story of the Hot Rod Race
When Fords and Lincolns was settin' the pace.
That story is true, I'm here to say
I was drivin' that Model A.

It's got a Lincoln motor and it's really souped up.
That Model A Vitimix makes it look like a pup.
It's got eight cylinders, uses them all.
It's got overdrive, just won't stall.

With a 4-barrel carb and a dual exhaust,
With 4.11 gears you can really get lost.
It's got safety tubes, but I ain't scared.
The brakes are good, tires fair.

Pulled out of San Pedro late one night
The moon and the stars was shining bright.
We was driving up Grapevine Hill
Passing cars like they was standing still.

All of a sudden in a wink of an eye
A Cadillac sedan passed us by.
I said, ""Boys, that's a mark for me!""
By then the taillight was all you could see.

Now the fellas was ribbing me for being behind,
So I thought I'd make the Lincoln unwind.
Took my foot off the gas and man alive,

I shoved it on down into overdrive.
Wound it up to a hundred-and-ten
My speedometer said that I hit top end.
My foot was blue, like lead to the floor.
That's all there is and there ain't no more.

Now the boys all thought I'd lost my sense
And telephone poles looked like a picket fence.
They said, ""Slow down! I see spots!
The lines on the road just look like dots.""

Took a corner; sideswiped a truck,
Crossed my fingers just for luck.
My fenders was clicking the guardrail posts.
The guy beside me was white as a ghost.

Smoke was coming from out of the back
When I started to gain on that Cadillac.
Knew I could catch him, I thought I could pass.
Don't you know by then we'd be low on gas?

We had flames coming from out of the side.
Feel the tension. Man! What a ride!
I said, ""Look out, boys, I've got a license to fly!""
And that Caddy pulled over and let us by.

Now all of a sudden she started to knocking,
And down in the dips she started to rocking.
I looked in my mirror, a red light was blinking
The cops was after my Hot Rod Lincoln!

They arrested me and they put me in jail.
And called my pappy to throw my bail.
And he said, ""Son, you're gonna' drive me to drinkin'
If you don't stop driving that Hot, Rod, Lincoln!""",Hot Rod Lincoln,2006

And stand before the mirror
And you comb your hair
And grab your coat and hat
And you walk, wet streets
Tryin' to remember
All the wild breezes
In your mem'ry ever. 
And ev'rything looks so complete
When you're walkin' out on the street
And the wind catches your feet
And sends you flyin', cryin'

And all the girls walk by 
Dressed up for each other 
And the boys do the boogie-woogie

Walk into the office, in you business suit
And matching shoes
With your hair pulled back neatly
You tug at your glasses
And you sit down just 3 desks down
And I watch you in the fluorescent glare,
And my mind drifts away somewhere

And I see you... In a different light
Your hair falling down
With love in your eyes
In my mind.... you're a beautiful sight
I see you in a different light
Just the way I saw you, last night

There's girls at the office
The guys always notice, when they walk by
But, you're not the type
They don't know what I know
How somethings just don't show
In tailored tweets, that's fine with me
Let them all think what they want to
As for me when I look at you

Today he's going off to school, you know
And that favorite photograph of you and me that New Year's eve
Was that lost year or fifteen years ago

When we were still just sweethearts, the days would pass so slow
Tonight, time found us snuggled up so close
All that time that just stood still, oh, so long ago

But when I saw the lovin' way
You held onto each other
It was all that I could do, not to break right down and cry

On a slow train back to Georgia
Or in the grey walls of a prison doing time

And go to hell and face the devil

Doug Stone,"Eighty hours a week, that's what I call work
and this black under my blue collar is his best pay dirt.
They work me hard from dawn to dusk
Doin' double time puttin' out sweat for a filthy buck.

F.I.C.A. and the state
They make my paycheck look like a big mistake.
Tax man takes his before I see a cent
And what they don't get, I've already spent.

[Chorus]
I'm addicted to a dollar , that ain't worth a dime.
I pick up my paycheck and pass it on down the line.
The more money that I'm making, the less I can call mine.
Well, I'm addicted to a dollar , that ain't worth a dime.

Got me more payments than I've got checks.
Ten more to go on this car, it's a wreck.
Landlord's at my door, it's a life of hard knocks.
When all I really want is my piece of the rock.

Someway everyone
Someday we will learn what life is worth
Just how precious is each birth - everyone
Though the dark and cold threaten every soul
Look into your heart for what you need to know

Never let the fear of the unknown be a reason not to try
While I live, let me learn to give what's mine
And at the journey's end, know the reason why
If you truly want to fly, dream high
People...some will fly beyond the stars
People...some will fall
But maybe, if we believe in who we are
Though the distance seems to far after all
Never be denied
Reach for what's inside
Look into your heart for what you need to find

Who stood on the corner down town

he was holding a cup
Filled up with nothing
From the christmas shopping crowd
And though I barely came up to the top of his cane
I reached up and gave him
Every cent to my name.

(chorus):
Three little pennies.
Were all that I had
One that I'd found
Two from my dad
Three little pennies not much of a gift
But Dad said ""that's plenty, if it's all you can give.""

that evening my dad told a wonderful story to me
About a child and the manger.
The wise men who came bearing gifts on the first christmas eve.
There was a part I'm sure he made up
About a stable boy who couldn't give much..

Three little pennies.
Were all that he had
One that he'd found
Two from his dad
Three little pennies not much of a gift
But Dad said ""that's plenty if it's all you can give.""

next morning was christmas
And I had prayed hard for a bike
But all that I found was the tiniest box
With three shiny pennies inside

and I was so disapointed because I had been good
But times had been bad so I understood.
And daddy said:

""three little pennies.
Were all that you had
But you gave them freely
So I gave them back
Three little pennies not much of a gift
You're bike is outside because you've learned how to give""

Doug Stone,"A little white house, in the heart of town
On a little sad street, just a little run down
Became a home, for Bill and Sue
Two newlyweds, who did the best that they could do

And when they brush each other, passin' in the hall
Sue would smile and say, ""This place is pretty small""

""But you know, love grows best in little houses
With fewer walls to separate
Where you eat and sleep so close together
You can't help but communicate
Oh, and if we had more room between us, think of all we'd miss
Love grows best, in houses just like this""

Before too long, Sue and Bill
Were makin' plans, for Jack and Jill
Oh, happy day, when the news came in
But what to do, when they found out Sue was having twins

When they could not pass each other in the hall
Well, Sue would smile and say, ""This place is really, really small""

With fewer walls to separate
Where you eat and sleep so close together

That little white frame house still keeps them warm
Though it's been thirty-two years, since the kids were born
And when they look back now, they hold each other tight
And whisper in each other's ears, ""You know you were right""

Doug Stone,"Bobby was a beautiful girl from a small town in a great big world.
Her daddy owned the corner store off of 7th Avenue.
Danny-Jo just turned nineteen, cigarettes rolled under his sleeve,
His leather jacket and his faded jeans and a bad attitude.
But it's hard to be tough,
When you're falling in love. 

He said: ""I know I'm down on my knees,
""But I wanna be the one, your only one.
""I'm beggin' you please,
""And I know that I don't have that much,
""But for whatever I don't have,
""I'll make up in love."" 

Her daddy was a simple man, he raised Bobby with a real stern hand.
Said he never would understand just what she saw in him.
After workin' at the store all day bringin' in an honest day's pay,
Man you shoulda seen his face when Danny-Jo walked in,
Sayin': ""Please understand,""

At how they walked down the aisle.
Twenty years have gone by,
He remembers it still.
How she bid his will with a look in her eyes:
Now he knows she was right.

To the days when you were mine
I'd wrap you up with these two arms
And never let you go

I'd say the things I didn't say
The words that might have made you stay

I was always somewhere else
Thinkin' only of myself
Livin' just to chase a dream
A dream that was a doubt

I should've seen the warnin' signs
I never paid 'em any mind
Everybody saw it comin', not me

I kept reachin' for the stars and shootin' for the moon
When all along I had them in my hand
Little did I know how fast my world could slip away
It took losin' you for me to understand

That all you ever wanted was
Just to be a step above
All the things that stood between

Doug Stone,"She was the prom queen, the world was hers
With a wave of her hand, whispered words
Hearts broken by her abilities
Addicted to the sweetness of a gentle kiss
Lost in a search for something she might never find
Never know if she don't try, the results will come in time
No time to smell the roses, let alone slow dance
Too many bad memories of forgotten romance
She walked out slammed the door
Damn him, she didn't need him
A child game she had to cloth him feed him
Alone after so long gave up hope
Convinced all men were abusive
Undependable heathens and sold dope
Mister right wasn't coming
A fact that she would have to face
She didn't have no time to waste, she had a man to raise
No man to chase, sick of living in this blasted place
No time to sit around weeping like a basket case
Her son made it all worthwhile
The only man that got to see her smile
She reminisced about her lifestyle before the baby came
She did what responsible people do, she changed

She's a different kinda lady
She's not often understood
She's a different kinda lady
She's not often understood

She was my best friend, my playmate
Moved in next door just before the first grade
We ran foot races, climb trees, caught insects
Before money and sex, powder and x
Before popularity came so crucial
She had love and the feeling was mutual
We used to cut our feet barefooted in chipped glass
Now we blow smoke as we skip class
New friends came, and with them came change
The pressure was all, would lil mama maintain
She began to drift away, the distance between us grew wider
Didn't have to speak to me, I could see the hurt inside her
I hear the words out of her mouth
But they don't reflect what she really feel
I've seen the smile before I know it isn't real
Artificial happiness, superficial friends
A nonstop whirl wind, when will it all end
Her eyes roll back, she began to convulse
They searched for a heartbeat, but she had no pulse
Autopsy results show she mixed powder and downers
And none of her new friends were around her
When her family found her, but a

She's a different kinda lady
She's not often understood
She's a different kinda lady
She's not often understood

She was a young girl seventeen, if I recollect correctly
A baby with a baby, that baby was me
She worked everyday still it wasn't enough
World was rough, ol' girl was tough
Drop me off in the morning
Come back and get me in the afternoon
Free spirits lost being guided by the moon
Used to take me to church, try to make me a man
But hard times put drastic changes in plan
She was out there, every time she got up, she fell again
In love with a bastard, stay in and out the pen
Alcoholic addict, never tried to change himself
Beat her to a pulp, and make her blame herself
I tried to talk to her, mama you don't have to stay
Just pack your bags and go, you can walk away
She tell me about this pain, hoping I'd never experience it
Baby boy love is some serious shit, I pray for change
Eventually it came, like rays of light after days of rain
She turned her life around, walked away never to return
Still tempted by the fire, just tired of being burned

She's not often understood
She's a different kinda lady

All my people told me I could
Be anything I wanted to be when I grew up
You know what I'm saying, and that's it for us
I was a big old white boy from
Tennessee that wanted to be a rap star
And that was fucking impossible

I over came opsticals did what they said couldn't be done
I went from murder dog to fire? That's me, I'm the one
The only one who held it down for lower class
Before it was cool to be white trash
You can't change the world so why try
Watch them change to tie die's
From fist fights to drive bys
I be out there late night and I'm might die
So when I'm gone say goodbye to that white guy
I dedicate this to the hags and fags
Who associate Haystak with racism and rebel flags
You fucking bitch
When you mention me speak on killer weed and body bags
Hi proportion? And burning the flag
My grand daddy's mammy was half Cherokee
My grand mamma family came from an island in Germany
And me I'm just a mixed breed from Tennessee
Everything you fake mother fuckers pretend to be

I'm from the land of the brave
Home of the free
And there's five million other fools just like me
We the have-nots little badass kids
Momma doing bad, dad der doing a bid
And we was set free to do as we please
Reek havoc on the streets of our communities
And we didn't have no curfew
We didn't have no rules
We don't need no book bags cause we don't go to school
Imagine my middle finger
In the mother fuckin sky
Screaming CWB till I die

Twenty
Auh twenty, I don't have no twenties
But I got some fat dimes
Auh you like that huh
Come back and fuck with your people ya hear

Born a bastard child who struggled with love
We congregated on the corners puffin and pushing dubs
A lack of love, a lack of understanding
A lack of compassion a lack of better parenting
The sad thing is either they don't know
Don't show
Or just don't care, well
That is till Tad and Rad?
Come to school with gauges
And start shooting up the rich kids in the faces
Mom and dad ducked in their shoes

Music that they listed to""

Say goodbye and wish me luck
Pass the word I'm riding out again

I gotta see that purple sage
I've got to roll with one more stage
Before this worn out western movie ends

Lord I used to ride so high
They wrote songs about me
But now the old man's home alone
They rode on without me

And now my six guns not so fast
I believe this trip might be my last
This Fadin' Renegade made his last stand

Hand me down my boots and spurs
Pray the weather don't get worse
Pass the word I've done the best I can

I gotta ride out one more last storm
I've got to rope one last longhorn
Before I turn my pony loose for good
Lord I used to think I'd ride
Gods prairie all of my, my days
But now you can't ride anywhere
For the barb wire and the highways
And I'm a stranger in this time
My buckskin days are all behind

I think I'll call in and say I'm running late

And steal an hour from the day

Doug Supernaw,"It hurts down deep when angry words are spoken
Because of this countless tears are shed
Much too often tender hearts are broken
When hasty thoughtless angry words are said
As you know I stormed out of the house again this mornin'
I slammed the door and didn't even take your usual kiss
Well angry words can make us do things without a warnin'
I could hardly wait to get back home to tell you this
First of all you're the reason for my living
You've stuck with me when things were at their worst
We've got the home the kids and the joy they're giving
But over all you always will come first
We found out a long ago this life's no paradise
We're not angels or else we'd all have wings
Above all angry words I hope you realize that I love you if that means anything

Doug Talley,"Whenever skies look gray to me
And trouble begins to brew,
Whenever the Winter winds become too strong,
I concentrate on you.

When fortune cries ""Nay! Nay!"" to me
And people declare ""You're through!"",
Whenever the blues become my only song,
I concentrate on you.

On your smile so sweet, so tender,
When at first your kiss I decline.
On the light in your eyes when I surrender,
And once again our arms intertwine

And so, when wise men say to me
That love's young dream never comes true,
To prove that even wise men can be wrong,
I concentrate on you.",I Concentrate on You,1998

And it's never far
Oh, what all we were
But all that's changing now
All your wishes for something somewhere

Through this different town
With its different streets

Oh yeah, but who knows where we're goin'.

Take my hand -- come on
And on we'll go.
Take my handâ?¦

Something's lasted
There's a home.

So, my friend, we'll head out with our hopes again.
Oh yeah, we'll face whatever's thrown us.

Come, we'll walk, we'll find what lingers
Of the things that might have been there
Other dreams of other wintersâ?¦

Take my hand -- come on
And on we'll go.
Take my handâ?¦

There, with the tears we've known.
Trailing our shadows,
You and me on this road.

Built of sadness,

Excuse my french or whatever these fuckers now be saying
Almost famous noticed by ratchetness with a bit of sense
Cause they be speaking my language, girl you know what it is
Now can I live it up, shots until she gives it up
Say her man been fucking up and right now she don't give a fuck
Loving my style, on the first date she don't give it up
Couple of hours, back seat, about to give it up
Now can I beat it up, video tape media
Put that shit on worldstar and label that shit B-B-beat it up
Now that's impressive girl keep dropping that ass
The way you engineered, I had to throw a drop in the track
Damn, cause you ain't sweating it, a player's favorite coach
Calling plays like a boss, famous for the pick and roll for show
Cause you be doing, you be doing the most
But catching feelings, catching feelings, you'll be catching me ghost

You see that hoe over there, yeah that bitch be fronting
Always up to something scheming niggas and shit
Cellphone ain't even on but taking selfies and shit
Miss Independent do your thing, cause I ain't knocking your shit
You swearing all up and down, you woke up like this
Oh yeah you’re flawless I get it, you’re very known in your city
And run your mouth by the minute and for the vine you done did it
But damn, that's crazy girl, make that ass twerk
Make that ass twerk
Bounce it up and down and show a nigga that you got it girl
Damn you got it girl
That's thorough for certainly, ain't nothing like Sara Lee
Have it your way, bitch this ain't Burger King

Girl, you’re a thot tamale I’m sweating, thot tamale I’m sweating
Never met you but I don’t respect you, because you keep bopping all in my section
Seen them bottles coming and those sparkle sparking, now you’re making you way to the light show
You’re the type to get in a wreck and start giving neck before calling Geico
I’m psycho, crazy but never been crazy enough to go wife hoes
I ride fours and when I be swanging and banging it start raining white hoes, and I like those
But let’s get it clear, cause I don’t like speaking in typo
You chief hoe stop fucking and sucking these niggas just cause they got nice clothes
Got Gucci this and Gucci that, and you know that the belt match the Gucci hat
And if your girl a thot, bet your girl a bop, and start fucking and throwing that coochie back
I treat the beat like it’s a test car, crash the track like a dummy in it
And girl you’re a thot if you walk around with a loui bag with no money in it

Crazy nigga thought he was gone, but he ain't gone
Even King Kong took his black monkey ass home
When I hit the block, watch them scatter like roaches
So don't be fake, 'cause I know what a hoe is
Handle my business, no playin' 'cause I'm focused
You the definition of what a fuckin' joke is
When they see you comin', they play with your emotions
Fuck with my emotions and they find you in the oceans
Yeah I said oceans, yeah I mean plural
My boy got a knife to turn a boy into a girl
We'll fuck up your world, no boos to my drama
We'll include yo mama, if you f**k with my commas

I ain't tryin' to hear you

Pop yo' ass right behind the ear within' hear
Nothin' like a firecracker, hits you like a linebacker
Don't forget the grind factor, I am a grinder
And here's a reminder, ain't no tellin' where they find ya
Now what this got to do with the price of tea in China?
Nothin' motherfucker just don't act like a vagina
You won't catch the rath of this hardcore rhymer
Now you got 55 niggas right behind ya
Now you wanna talk it out, but we don't negotiate
Now you gotta do all kind of shit that we know you hate

Off the grape shit, and I'm feelin' like I'm faceless

You a sucka!

If you hate another for being successful, what are you?

Huh, you got that right son. Look like you gonna past this test
But I got one more question for you
Son, if any man depends on another man and can't think on his own
Can't survive on his own, can't take good care of his 

Family, you know what I mean son
I mean, you were put in this world by yourself
You're supposed to depend on you 

And nobody else. I mean son
When a man can't function on his own and put his problems on another man
son, what type of man is that? What do you call that type of person? 

Dad, can I curse? 
Son, if you have to express yourself. Tell me, what type of man is that?

Dougie D,"And now, the end is near
And so I face the final curtain
My friend, I'll say it clear
I'll state my case, of which I'm certain

I've lived a life that's full
I've traveled each and every highway
Oh, and more, much more than this
I did it my way

Regrets, I've had a few
But then again, too few to mention
I did what I had to do
And saw it through without exemption

I planned each charted course
Each careful step along the byway
But more, much more than this
I did it my way

Yes, there were times, I'm sure you knew
When I bit off more than I could chew
But through it all, when there was doubt
I ate it up and spit it out
I faced it all and I stood tall
And did it my way

I've loved, I've laughed and cried
Had my fill, my share of losing
And now, as tears subside
I find it all so amusing

To think I did all that
And may I say, not in a shy way
""Oh no, oh no not me
I did it my way""

For what is a man, what has he got?
If not himself, then he has naught
To say the things he truly feels
And not the words of one who kneels

And did it my way

Cuttin' through the cigarillo like a lumberjack
In the morning what I need is to breath again a whole lot of weed
But maybe somebody can give me what I need when I want no less than the best of the trees
DJ Paul and Juicy J, 8-ball and M-J-G
And Young Buck we don't give a fuck
We must represent this Tennessee
We drink a whole lot of Hennessey
Nigga got a little hair on his chest
And we be like Bill Clinton girl take it out ya mouth
We'll shoot it down right on yo chest

Uhh
Hold up
Comin' down
Hold up
Smoke somethin'

[Verse 1: Pimp C]
Lately he been flippin' and, stayin' on the grind
Tellin' you that you fine, but he ain't spendin' no time
I be pourin' wine, tryin' to, knock out your spine
Make you mine, from behind, to some slowed down ""Bump n' Grind""
His thang like a dirty Sweet, from off the street
My thang like a O' of indo, from Sacramento
Lately y'all been monkeyin', he, call you a bitch
Keep me all up in yo' shit, try'na dig you a new ditch
Now I admit, that he rich, and that his money is good
Got my dicked sucked in his 'Six, I'm fuckin' on leather and wood
I'm just a yougin' from the hood, with some dick if ya good
With him, you know that you shouldn't
With me, you know that you should
Go pussy thug, like a glove when I push and I shove
Knock a dime out the climb, cause I ain't makin' love
See yo' man the type of guy, to get jealous and hit'cha
But me, I lick ya where he don't, and suck real hard on yo' nipple
My game is sharp as a cicle, she love my pickle
And if you gave her a dime, nigga she gave me a nickel
So while you thinkin', she done jet, she got my dick on her mind
Keep on neglectin' yo' gal, young Pimp C be spendin' yo' time
Time

[Chorus]
Is'a playa
Is'a mack
I love gettin to this ladies
But not more than these paper stacks
Now rule one, get your cash on m.o.b.
Keep paper in my pocket my nigga p.i.m.p
Don't hate me major
Just hate the game
The only reason your woman diggin' me 
Is cause I play with things
Don't take it personal my nigga
I dont love I'ma playa
She just gon' keep me company
While I get lifted and I lay her

[Verse 2: Bun B]
Well naturally, I have to be, dead serious, maybe not
Let me tell a tale about this broad that thought she played me out
Yes, I was impressed, by the sex in her ass
W-U-I-S her, Versacci, down like Fran, dress her, bless her heart
She was a sweet-tart, but'cha never understood her point in our duo
Talkin' smart wit' all that ""you know"", comin' wit' he-say, she-say
From what she heard at the club, bout some chick that I had played on
Well bitch, you should have stayed home
She mad cause I done told her girl off, but the bitch was wrong, and you
You gon' let these messy ho's fuck yo' world off
I tried to love her man, but see love is one thang, and dumb is anotha'
Brotha', I'd be dumb to let her run thangs
I should've passed, but I was gassed, super-unleaded
And her nappy-headed ass gon' regret it, remember I said it
Cause I'm, in a sublime, new state and frame of mind
Cause it'd be a crime, for me to waste my time
My time

[Chorus]

(Verse 3, Twista]
Did you ever think about who's ass ya girl's was
Before the booty had became yours?
If a nigga's sane flows, you know everything goes
Fuckin' in it til' it's colorful as rainbows
Sportin' furry Kango's, she can't go, rockin' paid shows
Paper hard to fold, plus I roll slick, keep talkin' shit
If you don't like me, it's most like-ly, cause I done holla'd at yo bitch
Why she so thick? Tellin' lies and ya said to be believin' 'em
But I make her feel like ""Uh-huh"", can you do it? ""Uh-huh""
But when I scoop her up, she know that I'm the one to make a slut-cum
Gotta man, he a lame anyway, mother-fuck that stuff
Mad cause I snuck that love, baby don't bust that slug
So go on head roll up that bud, so we can fuck
So wassup? Now we in the Suburb', submerged, watch a movie
Or bumpin' U-G, K shit, scoop a bitch or hit the booty
How the man, yea I knew g, but she don't usually, say shit
Cause the pussy make a motherfucka' wanna ball up and cry
Chicka-pow-pow, I love them thighs when I'm rollin' aside
I ain't gon' up and die, like the guy that we got high
Take away more than two hits, two blows
She heard my new shit, it was new clothes
New golds, carefully Herringbones, and cell-phones
But her friend home, now I'm freakin' two ho's
If ya girl be wit' me, somethin' nifty, she prob'ly wanna lick me
I'm the Twista, I flame a ho pissy drunk and drippy
Damn skippy, gamin' it from a shot of Mississippi, now pimp on

Yea son. Let me see this
Oh they didn't have questions like this when I grew up son
But I guess whatever 

It takes to make you be a man son. I'm all for it
Son, the first question is, if you rap about another 

Rapper on a record, what are you? 

You a sucka! 

Aha, you got that right son. Next question
If you hate another for being successful, what are you? 

You mean like, you rollin' in Benzes, they be like P.H.ing you

Yea son, what is that, what you call that? 
Dad, that only be two words. PLAYA HATA 

Huh, you got that right son. Look like you gonna past this test
But I got one more question for you
Son, if any man depends on another man and can't think on his own
Can't survive on his own, can't take good care of his 

Family, you know what I mean son
I mean, you were put in this world by yourself
You're supposed to depend on you 

And nobody else. I mean son
When a man can't function on his own and put his problems on another man
son, what type of man is that? What do you call that type of person? 

Dad, can I curse? 
Son, if you have to express yourself. Tell me, what type of man is that? 
That a punk ass bitch 

Hehehe, damn little P, you bout it, bout it, just like your daddy
Oh wait, one more question before I leave though

In a paper chase, in it just to win the race
Gotta be watching my back, and avoid the fakes
Really don't give a damn, what none of you hoes think
How many mo' niggaz, want to try my skills
Struggling hard, I'm trying to pay my bills

Everything that come in the past, came today

The sun is shining, every dog has his bone in time
And it seems to be, that my time is now
I remember, when they said I would be nothing
But now that nothing is something, and I be bringing 'em down
Sho' I'm a clown, nothing but the skill when I be wrecking
Up out of Texas, with diamonds all over my necklace
I keep they head checking, pass to profession
And can't nobody contest, 'cause that's the way we are a legend
You better count your blessings, 'cause I'm sick and tired of this thang
And while I be blowing my Mary Jane, I'm chilling with thugs
Sipping on mud, trying to keep my head long from slugs
Guerilla Maab on the rise, and we keeping it crunk

It was all a dream, other people said I would never be
Nothing, now collecting dividends to ride a Benz
Down I-10, dropping the top in the wind
With a friend once again, yelling out fuck friends
Bubble lens, when I be stacking my ends
Trying to see, could you really picture me
S3 with a JVC, 18's in the trunk ready to beat
Chunking deuce to hoes, and burning off on them freaks
I'm a ghetto superstar, and a certified thug
So all you certified scrubs, get certified slugs
Southside till I'm dead, gotta be moving they head
Gotta keep my head up, for my brother in the FED
This is dedicated to niggaz, who be turning they back
Slamming all of they do's, and burning off in they Lac
Since we done made it, they don't really know how to act

In everybody mutherfucking ear, about the group I'm in
Now look at the candy coupe I'm in
I took a big six hundred to the shop, and told em candy blue my Benz
I put a bunch of money in my billfold, 'cause I'm real cold
When I'm on the microphone
Everybody want to kill, to get a piece of my mill
But I'mma weigh my skills, better surrender or bite my chrome
'Cause I'mma fight my homeboys, write my own bars
When it comes, to the pen and pad
Thinking about the swine I had, and everything I own
Could the shit wasn't bad, but in reality nigga
I was fucked up low life, living in sin
But I was given a chance, to start pimping a pen
Now Blockbuster, Soundwaves and Sam Goody's
Be running out of my product, and re-order again
And certify myself, half a million sold

A yellow bitch, I'mma put my dick all in a hoe
A nigga want to plex, put his face all in the flo'
My foot all in the do', and coming in and out my barge

Till a nigga left with concussions, bring the end of discussion dog
You don't want to get me pissed off or ticked off your ass is fin to get pissed on
Not dissed on but clicked on, for stepping inside my zone

50 Cent, baby that's nothing but chump change
Shooting slugs at my partna, disrespecting the game
So feel this verbal cocaine, your whole tape was trash
Now the whole Screwed Up Click, gon beat that ass
So when you come in H-Town, don't hide behind your circle
We gon' tear the club up, leave both your eyes purple
Hurt you bitch nigga, that's from the Boss Man
I'm known for slapping boys, knocking em out with my hands
Understand bow down, and show some respect
We clicked up and heated, with knives hanging round our neck
I'm a cold blooded killa, do a murder for the price
So call the ambulance, and put this bitch up on some ice

[Chorus: Repeat 2X

In your motherfucking face, in your motherfucking trunk
Hell naw, it ain't gon' never stop nigga

Dougie MacLean,"A fond kiss, and then we sever 
A farewell, and then forever 
Deep in heart-wrung tears I'll pledge thee
Warring sighs and groans I'll wage thee

While the star of hope she leaves him 
Me nae cheerful twinkle lights me
Dark despair around be nights me

I'll ne'er blame my partial fancy
Nothing could resist my Nancy 
But to see her was to love her 
Love but her, and love for ever

Had we never loe'd sae blindly
Never met nor never parted

Fare thee weel, thou best and dearest

He knows when you're a wake
He knows if you've been bad or good

And mail it right away

I saw a little girl, she sure looked swell
I gave her the eye, I tried to carry on
That big black Cadillac pulled up, huh, she was gone

It should've been me with that real fine chick
It should've been me with that real fine chick
Oh, that should have been me
Driving that Cadillac

A little later on, five minutes past
And I saw a lady, she had a lot of class
I was trying to write her name down in my book
Her husband pulled out, give me one of them
Hot real dirty looks

It should've been me with that real fine chick
It should've been me with that real fine chick
The moral of the story is that it
Being her chaperone

Down in the corner was this real sharp cat
Had a 300 dollar platform shoes and a 100 dollar cowboy hat
He was standing on the curb by a fancy Buick down the floor
And this voice from inside says ""Come on sugar, let's go""

It should've been me with that real fine chick
It should've been me with that real fine chick
By now you know who that should have been
Driving that Dynaflow

I hate to get heavy but listen to this

I ate some fish 'n' chips, I felt okay
I passed by a fancy cafe
I saw a man eating one of them T-bone stakes
He hollered, gracious stand by the side feeling him, Lordy

It should've been me with that real fine chick
It should've been me with that real fine chick
Where was I? I was standing outside with ice cream and cake

It should've been me with that real fine chick
It should've been me gettin' my natural kick
That should have been me
Rubbin' on with a chick
