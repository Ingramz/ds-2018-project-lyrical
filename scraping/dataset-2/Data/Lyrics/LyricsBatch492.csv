Johnny Cash,"I tried so hard my dear to show that you're my every dream
Yet you're afraid each thing I do is just some evil scheme
Now a memory from your lonesome past keeps us so far apart
Why can't I free your doubtful mind and melt your cold, cold heart

Another love before my time made your heart sad and blue
And so my heart is paying now for things I didn't do
In anger unkind words are said they make the teardrops start
Why can't I free your doubtful mind and melt your cold, cold heart

Yeah, there was a time when I believed that you belonged to me
But now I know your heart is shackled to a memory

The more I learn to care for you the more we drift apart
Why can't I free your doubtful mind and melt your cold, cold heart
Why can't I free your doubtful mind and melt your cold, cold heart","Cold, Cold Heart",1987
Johnny Cash,"Some days I think this old machine is out to get me
Some days she does what I tell her
It's like dancing with the widow-maker forty hours a week
I'm talkin' 'bout a big old D10 Caterpillar

I don't know why I like to drive 'em like I do
It ain't nothin' but a hundred and seventy-five thousand pounds of steel
Could be the money babe, could be the power
Could be I love the way it feels
Could be I love the way it feels

But you know she's mighty unforgivin' and you got to pay attention
'Cause the d-10 can be the death of you
But I get her all fired up and I can feel it in my soul
And it's hard to tell just who's drivin' who

I can move Alaska all the way to Beirut
I can bulldoze a beeline from here to Peru
I can push the rocky mountains into the sea
You know heavy metal don't mean rock and roll to me

I'm like a modern day mule skinner, drivin' ten thousand mules
So say a little prayer every day
Lord, just let me get her turned around without fallin' off this mountain
You know the boss man don't like us treatin' his D10 that way

I don't know why I like to drive 'em like I do
It ain't nothin' but a hundred and seventy-five thousand pounds of steel
Could be the money babe, could be the power
Could be I love the way it feels
Could be I love the way it feels

Could be I love the way it feels
Could be I love the way it feels",Heavy Metal Don't Mean Rock and Roll to Me,1987
Johnny Cash,"I hear the train a comin'
It's rollin' 'round the bend,
And I ain't seen the sunshine
Since, I don't know when
I'm stuck in Folsom Prison
And time keeps draggin' on
But that train keeps a-rollin'
On down to San Antone

When I was just a baby
My Mama told me, ""Son
Always be a good boy
Don't ever play with guns,""
But I shot a man in Reno
Just to watch him die
When I hear that whistle blowin'
I hang my head and cry

I bet there's rich folks eatin'
In a fancy dining car
They're probably drinkin' coffee
And smokin' big cigars
Well I know I had it comin'
I know I can't be free
But those people keep a-movin'
And that's what tortures me

Well, if they freed me from this prison
If that railroad train was mine
I bet I'd move it on a little
Farther down the line
Far from Folsom Prison
That's where I want to stay
And I'd let that lonesome whistle
Blow my blues away",Folsom Prison Blues,1987
Johnny Cash,"She said come in stranger 
It's good to have you home 
I hurried through 'cause I knew it was you 
When I saw your dog, waggin' his tail 
Honey, why didn't you let me know by mail 
You've been gone so long 
She said come in stranger 

I know you're weary from all the miles 
Just sit right there in your easy chair 
And tell me all about the places you've been 
How long it'll be before you leave again 
I hope it's a long, long while 
She said come in stranger 

Everything 'round home is fine 
I've watched and I've waited for you to get back 
And I missed you all the time 

She said come in, stranger 
Oh how I miss you when you're gone 
I walk the floor and I watch the door 
And when I lie awake and wonder where you can be 
I'd give anything to have you here with me 
I get so lonesome all alone 
She said come in, stranger 

And won't you listen to my plea 
Stay long enough, so that the one I love 
Is not a stranger to me",Come in Stranger,1988
Johnny Cash,"If the good Lord's willing and the creek stays down
I'll be in your arms time the moon come around
For a taste of love that's shining in your eyes
If the rooster crows at the crackin' of the dawn
I'll be there just as sure as you're born
If the good Lord's willing and the creeks don't rise

I'll comb my hair down, brush my teeth
Shine up, slick up, dress up neat
Get everything looking just right
'Cause I want to look pretty when I see you tonight
Just as sure as the rabbits are a jumping in the hollow
I'll be there, you can bet your bottom dollar
If the good Lord's willing and the creeks don't rise

If the good Lord's willing and the creek stays low
I'll be there a knockin' at your door
With a hug and a kiss for the one I idolize

I'll wear my suit, my Sunday best
I'll be there lookin' my best
If the good Lord's willing and the creeks don't rise

I'll feed the mules and stop the hogs 
Feed the cows and chop all the logs
Get all of my working done 'cause tonight we're gonna have lots of fun
Just as sure as there ever was a preacher man
I'll be there with a ring for your hand
If the good Lord's willing and the creek don't rise",If the Good Lord's Willing,1988
Johnny Cash,"Well they closed down the auto plant in Mahwah late that month
Ralph went out lookin' for a job but he couldn't find none
He came home too drunk from mixin'Tanqueray and wine
He got a gun shot a night clerk now they call'm Johnny 99

Down in the part of town where when you hit a red light you don't stop
Johnny's wavin' his gun around and threatenin' to blow his top
When an off duty cop snuck up on him from behind
Out in front of the Club Tip Top they slapped the cuffs on Johnny 99

Well the city supplied a public defender but the judge was Mean John Brown
He came into the courtroom and stared young Johnny down
Well the evidence is clear gonna let the sentence son fit the crime
Prison for ninety eight and a year and we'll call it even Johnny 99

A fistfight broke out in the courtroom they had to drag Johnny's girl away
His mama stood up and shouted ""Judge don't take my boy this way""
Well son you got a statement you'd like to make
Before the bailiff comes to forever take you away

Now judge judge I had debts no honest man could pay
The bank was holdin' my mortgage and they was takin' my house away
Now I ain't sayin' that makes me an innocent man
But it was more 'n all this that put that gun in my hand

Well your honor I do believe I'd be better off dead
And if you can take a man's life for the thoughts that's in his head
Then won't you sit back in that chair and think it over judge one more time
And let 'em shave off my hair and put me on that execution line",Johnny 99,1988
Johnny Cash,"I'm a flag waving, patriotic nephew of my Uncle Sam
A rough riding fighting Yankee man
I love mom and apple pie
And the freedoms that we all enjoy across this beautiful land

I worked hard and I fight hard for the old Red, White, and Blue
And I'll die a whole lot harder if it comes to where I have to
I'm a flag waving, patriotic nephew of my Uncle Sam
A rough riding fighting Yankee man

And when I see old Glory waving
I think of all the brave men 
Who have fought and died for what is right and wrong
And when I see old Glory burnin', my blood begins to churnin'
And I could do some fightin' of my own

I don't believe in violence, I'm a God fearing man
But I'll stand up for my country just as long as I can stand
'Cause I'm a flag waving, patriotic nephew of my Uncle Sam
A rough riding fighting Yankee man

I'm a flag waving, patriotic nephew of my Uncle Sam
A rough riding fighting Yankee man
And I enjoy the liberty of being what I want to be 
And achieve any goals that I can

I was taught to turn the other cheek, but daddy used to say
Walk soft and pack a big stick, but never walk away
I'm a flag waving, patriotic nephew of my Uncle Sam
A rough riding fighting Yankee man

And when I see old Glory waving
I think of all the brave men 
Who have fought and died for what is right and wrong
And when I see old Glory burnin', my blood begins to churnin'
And I could do some fightin' of my own

'Cause I love all my brothers and we're proud of our group
We've got the greenest country here on God's green earth

A rough riding fighting Yankee man",Song of the Patriot,1988
Johnny Cash,"Just as far as I can remember
She'll remain the rose of my heart
Mama fell sick along in December
February brought us broken hearts

The reason we've not called a family reunion
We knew that she wouldn't be there
But now that we've thought it all over Mama
We know you're spirit is here

Oh no I can't forget the hours your the only one Momma
And sweeter than the flowers
Oh no there's no use to bother
To speak of you now would only hurt Father
Oh no momma we'll never forget you
And someday we'll meet you up there

We all gathered round and I stared at their faces
All heads were bowed mighty low
But this was one time we all had to face it
Though it hurt us so badly you know

Well it looked so good to see us together
But I had to look after dad
Oh no Mother when I passed by your casket
I didn't want to remember you dead",Sweeter Than the Flowers,1988
Johnny Cash,"There's a new moon over Jamaica
And the new year just got here, you see
There's a new moon over Jamaica
And I'm living with an old memory

So won't you come back to Jamaica?
You know it isn't so far
Look up in the sky where you left me that night
I'll be standing right under that star

There's a new moon over Jamaica
And the new year just got here, you see
There's a new moon over Jamaica
And I'm living with an old memory

I said good evening to Venus
She said good evening too
Out there somewhere, you know I could swear
She sent a message of true love from you

There's a new moon over Jamaica
And the new year just got here, you see
There's a new moon over Jamaica
And I'm living with an old memory

A new moon makes someone feel happy
A new moon makes someone lovesick
I'm thinking of you, but what can I do?
New moons and new years and old love's don't mix

There's a new moon over Jamaica
And the new year just got here, you see
There's a new moon over Jamaica
And I'm living with an old memory

Just the new year, a new moon and me

",New Moon Over Jamaica,1988
Johnny Cash,"There's a stool along the road to freedom
Like a gypsy in a guilty cage
But rising has not always been bright
Destiny dreams are made

My days all run together
Like a timeless honeycomb
I find myself wishing I could drink again
Water from the wells of home
Water from the wells of home
Water from the wells of home

I've seen all your shining cities
Lean against the yellow sky
I've seen the down, and I'll get better
I've seen many of strong men die

Well, the troubled hearts in the worried men
Things that I've been showed
Keep me always returning to
Water from the wells of home
Water from the wells of home
Water from the wells of home

I want to come back some day
To the water from the wells of home
Lord, take me back someday
To the water from the wells of home

I want to come back some day
To the water from the wells of home
I want to come back some day
To the water from the wells of home
Lord, take me back someday
",Water from the Wells of Home,1988
Johnny Cash,"In a world where everybody's fallin' apart
One by one, heart by heart
You and I stay together and we never even try
Side by side in a world turned upside down

Our love keeps spinnin' around
And you know it makes me wonder
As a restaurant for their lives
Where did we go right?
Where did we go right?

At a time when all the world is searchin' for truth
His love for you will even prove
And what we have is what everybody's tryin' to find
Peace of mind in a world turned upside down

Our love keeps spinnin' around
And you know it makes me wonder
As a restaurant for their lives
Where did we go right?
Where did we go right?

So many wrongs, so many lovers
I wish they all could know
What we've found in one another

In a world turned upside down
Our love keep spinnin' around
And you know it makes me wonder
As a restaurant for their lives
Where did we go right?
Where did we go right?
Where did we go right?",Where Did We Go Right,1988
Johnny Cash,"There's a family Bible on the table
Its pages worn and hard to read
But the family Bible on the table
Will ever be my key to memories

At the end of day when work was over
And when the evening meal was done
Dad would read to us from the family Bible
And we'd count our many blessings one by one

I can see us sittin' round the table
When from the family Bible dad would read
And I can hear my mother softly singing
Rock of ages, rock of ages cleft for me

Now this old world of ours is filled with trouble
This old world would also better be
If we'd found more Bibles on the tables
And mothers singing, rock of ages cleft for me

I can see us sittin' round the table
When from the family Bible dad would read
And I can hear my mother softly singing
Rock of ages, rock of ages cleft for me
Rock of ages, rock of ages cleft for me",Family Bible,1989

Johnny Cash,"You have gone and yet I'm still your prisoner
Although you're with your new love I'm not free
For you have placed a lock around my heart dear

And you are the keeper of the key
Love locked inside like mine burns constantly
So darling please come back to me

We'll lock our hearts together for a lifetime
And God will be the keeper of the key

Only you can end my misery

Johnny Cash,"There was a man whose deeds were dark as night
And quite by chance he rode into the light
A man, wild as a dust devil with, no place to run
Livin' by his wits and by his gun

He met a girl like none he'd ever known
She cared not for the wild oats he had sewn
And, so, he laid his gun down and set his spirit free
Began livin' in respectability

But his old ways of thinkin' wouldn't die
Could not forget the old creed he lived by
And the good and bad and the right and wrong kept fightin' for his soul
Till his heart and mind both went out of control

But now the old saloon had lost its spell
What once was laughter now was livin' hell
And the hookers, guns and drinkin' in his life were out of place
And in his mind he saw an Angel's face

So, he burned all his bridges in a day
And the Devil deeds were done and laid away
And he rode out a better man than when he first rode in
And the Angel got the Badman in the end
",Angel and the Badman,1990

I'm an easy rider, my wheels love to roll
I'm an easy rider, I ride a new road every day
I'm an easy rider, I will see you on my way

I got a number down in every town in my little black book
And they understand that I'm a travelin' man
So they don't think they got hooked
I'm an easy rider, I love that gray highway

I'm an easy rider, oh Lord, I love to roll
I'm an easy rider, movin's in my soul

Through streets paved with gold
Lifted some stones
Saw the skin and bones

Where the ground won't turn
And the rain it burns
Like the tears when I said goodbye

Yeah I went with nothing

I went wandering

I went drifting

Where men can't walk
Or freely talk
And sons turn their fathers in

Where the citizens like to sit
They say they want the kingdom
But they don't want God in it

Down that old eight lane
I passed by a thousand signs
Looking for my own name

I went with nothing
But the thought you'd be there too
Looking for you

I went out there
In search of experience
To taste and to touch
And to feel as much
As a man can
Before he repents

I went out searching
Looking for one good man
A spirit who would not bend or break
Who would sit at his father's right hand
I went out walking
With a bible and a gun
The word of God lay heavy on my heart
I was sure I was the one
Now Jesus, don't you wait up
Jesus, I'll be home soon
Yeah I went out for the papers
Told her I'd be back by noon

Yeah I left with nothing

Ever so often everybody's baby gets the urge to roam
But everybody's baby but mine's coming home

Here and there and everywhere there gonna be embracing

Johnny Cash,"As long as the moon shall rise as long as the rivers flow 
As long as the sun will shine as long as the grass shall grow 
The Senecas are an Indian tribe of the Iroquios nation 
Down on the New York Pennsylvania Line you'll find their reservation 
After the US revolution corn planter was a chief 
He told the tribe these men they could trust that was his true belief 
He went down to Independence Hall and there was a treaty signed 
That promised peace with the USA and Indian rights combined 
George Washington gave his signature the Government gave its hand 
They said that now and forever more that this was Indian land 
As long as the moon shall rise... 
On the Seneca reservation there is much sadness now 
Washington's treaty has been broken and there is no hope no how 
Across the Allegheny River they're throwing up a dam 
It will flood the Indian country a proud day for Uncle Sam 
It has broke the ancient treaty with a politician's grin 
It will drown the Indians graveyards corn planter can you swim 
The earth is mother to the the Senecas they're trampling sacred ground 
Change the mint green earth to black mud flats as honor hobbles down 
As long as the moon shall rise... 
The Iroquios Indians used to rule from Canada way south 
But no one fears the Indians now and smiles the liar's mouth 
The Senecas hired an expert to figure another site 
But the great good army engineers said that he had no right 
Although he showed them another plan and showed them another way 
They laughed in his face and said no deal Kinuza dam is here to stay 
Congress turned the Indians down brushed off the Indians plea 
So the Senecas have renamed the dam they call it Lake Perfidy 
As long as the moon shall rise... 
Washington Adams and Kennedy now hear their pledges ring 
The treaties are safe we'll keep our word but what is that gurgling 
It's the back water from Perfidy Lake it's rising all the time 
Over the homes and over the fields and over the promises fine 
No boats will sail on Lake Perfidy in winter it will fill 
In summer it will be a swamp and all the fish will kill 
But the Government of the USA has corrected George's vow 
The father of our country must be wrong what's an Indian anyhow

Broke away from British rule and took a stand
""We're on our own"", they said
And they looked across the land
With a defiant challenge
They looked across the land

""We will conquer you"", the colonists said
?We see your mighty mountains
We know of your lush green valleys
We're comin' to claim you, to tame you""
And the 'Movement Westward' started
",Begin West Movement,1991
Johnny Cash,"But the land was already claimed by a people
When the cowboy came and when the soldiers came
The story of the American Indian is in a lot of ways
A story of tragedy, like that day at Wounded Knee, South Dakota

Big Foot was an Indian chief
Of the Minneconjou band
A band of Minneconjou Sioux
From South Dakota land

Big Foot said to Custer
""Stay away from Crazy Horse""
But Custer crossed into Sioux land
And he never came back across

Then Big Foot led his people
To a place called Wounded Knee
And they found themselves surrounded
By the 7th Cavalry

Big chief Big Foot
Rise up from your bed
Minneconjou babies cry
For their mothers lying dead

Big Foot was down with a fever
When he reached Wounded Knee
And his people all were prisoners
Of the 7th Cavalry

Two hundred women and children
And another hundred men
Raised up a white flag of peace
But peace did not begin

An accidental gunshot
And Big Foot was first to die
And over the noise of the rifles
You could hear the babies cry

Big chief Big Foot
It's good that you can't see
Revenge is being wrought
By Custer's 7th Cavalry

Then smoke hung over the canyon
On that cold December day
All was death and dying
Around where Big Foot lay

Farther on up the canyon
Some had tried to run and hide
But death showed no favorites
Women, men, and children died

One side called it a massacre
The other a victory
But the white flag is still waving
Today at Wounded Knee

Big chief Big Foot
Your Minneconjou band
Is more than remembered here
In South Dakota land

Hiawatha old and grayin' listened to the older prophet listened to Lagu
And the young men and the women from the land of Ojibways
From the land of the Dakotas from the woodlands and the prairies

Stood and listened to the prophet heard lagu tell Hiawatha
""I have seen"" he said, ""A water bigger than the big sea water
Broader than the gitchgoomy bitter so that none cold drink it
Salty so that none would use it""

Hiawatha then spoke to them stopped all their jeering and their jesting
And he spoke to all the people
It's true what Lagu tells you for I have seen it in a vision
I have also seen the water to the east to the land of morning

And upon this great water came a strange canoe with pinions
Bigger than a grove of pine trees, taller than the tallest tree tops
And upon this great canoe were sails to carry it swiftly
And it carried many people, strange and foreign were these people

And white were all their faces and with hair their chins were covered
Then said Hiawatha, ""I beheld a darker vision""
Many hundreds came behind them pushed their way across our prairies
In our woodlands rang their axes, in our valleys smoked their cities

Our people were all scattered all forgetful of our councils
Left their homelands going westward wild and woeful

And the man with bearded faces, the men with skin so fair
With their barking sticks of thunder drove the remnants of our people
Farther westward, westward, westward then wild wild and wilder
Grew the west that once was ours

And a gambler named Jim Bowie and a Britisher named Travis

And the Cherokee and Shawnee
And the Creek and The Ojibwa
And the Choctaw and the Quapaw
And all the tribes along the rivers

My Gods who were wild ridden stand quiet by my side
For although I loved her she would not be my bride
Oh goodbye softly sweet one it was splended while it ran
Goodbye my bitter white girl I'll forget you if I can
She came up to the pueblo with her bright blonde hair
They told me not to love her but I did not care
She took me to her parties she carried me around
And I was a proud one the tallest man in town
For I found great wonder all wrapped in brilliant dreams
I held her strong but gentle as kings have held their queens
I learned to drink strong whiskey as she took me here and there
Until life without my whiskey I could not bear
Oh goodbye softly sweet one...

Well when she came to leave me she took me by the arm
And she said she loved me and would not do me harm
But she would not marry not an Indian she said
She thanked me for my offer and I wished that I was dead
Now I'm back among my people and they are kind to me
Although I'm sad with staggers when I drink that tough whiskey
For I've been a white girl's pet a captive Indian
Shown off and discarded just a drunk who might have been
Oh goodbye softly sweet one...

With no way to hold my head that didn't hurt
And the beer I had for breakfast wasn't bad
So I had one more for dessert
Then I fumbled in my closet through my clothes
And found my cleanest dirty shirt
Then I washed my face and combed my hair
And stumbled down the stairs to meet the day

I'd smoked my mind the night before
With cigarettes and songs I'd been picking
But I lit my first and watched a small kid
Playing with a can that he was kicking
Then I walked across the street
And caught the Sunday smell of someone's frying chicken
And Lord, it took me back to something that I'd lost
Somewhere, somehow along the way

On a Sunday morning sidewalk
I'm wishing, Lord, that I was stoned
'Cause there's something in a Sunday
That makes a body feel alone
And there's nothing short a' dying
That's half as lonesome as the sound
Of the sleeping city sidewalk
And Sunday morning coming down

In the park I saw a daddy
With a laughing little girl that he was swinging
And I stopped beside a Sunday school
And listened to the songs they were singing
Then I headed down the street
And somewhere far away a lonely bell was ringing
And it echoed through the canyons
Like the disappearing dreams of yesterday

On a Sunday morning sidewalk

And its hands never hung by its side

Johnny Cash,"On Christmas Eve I dreamed I traveled all around the earth 
And in my dream I saw and heard the ways the different people hail the king 
Whose star shone in the east and what a dream it was 
In London Town I walked around Piccadilly Circus 

A mass of people movin' here and there I wandered where 
On every face at every place was hurry up I'm late 
But a kind old man at a chestnut stand said merry Christmas mate 
And I felt the Christmas spirit 
 
In a little town nestled down in Bavaria Germany 
I walked along to see what the feeling there would be 
And here again was the busy din the rushin' the yellin' 
But some kind boy said Frohliche Weihnachten 
Not undesratnding the words but gettin' the buyin' and sellin' 
I felt the Christmas spirit 
 
In Bethlehem I heard a hymn some distant choir sang 
And with other tourists I walked along to a church as its bells rang 
Then I heard someone tell someone there's where Christ was born 
I wonder if he looked like our baby looked on that first morn 

And then I really felt the Christmas spirit 
From a businessman in the Holy Land as a sidewalk souvenir shop 
I bought a little Bible since I'd hardly stopped 
And it was in Paris France somehow by chance that I took the Bible out 

And as I flipped the pages I saw these words and I knew what it was all about 
For I read fear not for behold I bring you good tidings of great joy 
Which shall be to all people 
For unto you he was born this day in the City of David a Saviour 
Which is Christ the Lord 
 
Then I took the little Holy Book held it close and tight 
I closed my eyes and visualized the glory of that night 
So suddenly it came to me for when I awoke on Christmas Day 
I felt the Christmas spirit down deep inside to stay

Above Thy deep and dreamless sleep the silent stars go by 
Yet in Thy dark streets shineth the everlasting light

Get rhythm, when you get the blues.

Well, I sat down to listen to the shoeshine boy
And I thought I was gonna jump with joy
Slapped on the shoe polish left and right
He took a shoeshine rag and he held it tight
He stopped once to wipe the sweat away
I said you're a mighty little boy to be-a workin' that way
He said I like it with a big wide grin
Kept on a poppin' and he said again

Get rhythm, when you get the blues
C'mon get rhythm, when you get the blues
It only cost a dime, just a nickel a shoe
It does a million dollars worth of good for you

Johnny Cash,"An old cowboy went riding out one dark and windy day
Upon a ridge he rested as he went along his way
When all at once a mighty herd of red eyed cows he saw
A-plowing through the ragged sky and up the cloudy draw

Their brands were still on fire and their hooves were made of steel
Their horns were black and shiny and their hot breath he could feel
A bolt of fear went through him as they thundered through the sky
For he saw the riders coming hard and he heard their mournful cry

Yippie yi ooh
Yippie yi yay
Ghost riders in the sky

Their faces gaunt, their eyes were blurred, their shirts all soaked with sweat
He's riding hard to catch that herd, but he ain't caught 'em yet
'Cause they've got to ride forever on that range up in the sky
On horses snorting fire
As they ride on hear their cry

As the riders loped on by him he heard one call his name
If you want to save your soul from hell a-riding on our range
Then cowboy change your ways today or with us you will ride
Trying to catch the devil's herd, across these endless skies

Yippie yi ooh
Yippie yi yay

I took a shot of cocaine and I shot my baby down
I shot her down then I went to bed
I stuck that lovin' forty-four beneath my head

Woke up next morning and I grabbed that gun
I took a shot of cocaine and away I run
Made a good run but I run too slow
The overtook me down in Juarez Mexico

In the hot joint takin' the pill
There walked the sheriff from Jericho Hill
Willy Lee your name is not Jack Brown
You're the dirty hack that shot your woman down
Yes so my name's is Billy Lee
If you've got a warrant you better read it to me
I shot her down 'cause she made me sore
I thought I was her daddy but she had five more

When I was arrested I was dressed in black
They threw me on a freight train and hauled me back
Had no friend who'd go my bail
They stuck my dried-up carcass in the county jail

Early next morning 'round half past nine
I saw the sheriff comin' down the line
That sheriff yelled as he cleared his throat
Said come on you dirty hackin' to the district court

Into the courtroom my trial began
Where I was judged by twelve honest men
Yes as the jury started walkin' out
I saw that little judge commence to look about
In about five minutes then walked a man
Holding the verdict in his right hand
The verdict read in the first degree
I shouted Lordy Lordy please have mercy on me

The judge he smiled when he picked up his pen
Ninety-nine years in the San Quentin Penn
Ninety-nine years underneath that ground
But I can't forget that day I shot that bad bitch down

Sat a boy and his guitar, and the people came from miles around.
And all the girls from there to Austin,
Were slipping away from home and putting jewelery in hock.
To take the trip, to go and listen,
To the little dark-haired boy who played the Tennessee flat top box.

And he would play,

Well, he couldn't ride or wrangle, and he never cared to make a dime.
But give him his guitar, and he'd be happy all the time.
And all the girls from nine to ninety,
Were snapping fingers, tapping toes, and begging him: ""Don't stop.""
And hypnotized and fascinated,
By the little dark-haired boy who played the Tennessee flat top box.

And he would play,

Then one day he was gone, and no one ever saw him 'round,
He'd vanished like the breeze, they forgot him in the little town.
But all the girls still dreamed about him.
And hung around the cabaret until the doors were locked.
And then one day on the Hit Parade,
Was a little dark-haired boy who played the Tennessee flat top box.

From a soldier who'd been wounded in the fray

Many a soldier shed his lifeblood on my blade

But I am still alive

I was a sailor
I was born upon the tide
And with the sea I did abide
I sailed a schooner round the Horn to Mexico
I went aloft and furled the mainsail in a blow
And when the yards broke off they said that I got killed
But I am living still

I was a dam builder
Across the river deep and wide
Where steel and water did collide
A place called Boulder on the wild Colorado
I slipped and fell into the wet concrete below
They buried me in that great tomb that knows no sound
But I am still around
I'll always be around and around and around and around and around

I fly a starship
Across the Universe divide
And when I reach the other side
I'll find a place to rest my spirit if I can
Perhaps I may become a highwayman again
Or I may simply be a single drop of rain
But I will remain
And I'll be back again, and again and again and again and again",Highwayman,1993

But they don't want God in it

Looking for my own name

In search of experience
To taste and to touch
And to feel as much
As a man can
Before he repents

I went out searching
Looking for one good man
A spirit who would not bend or break
Who would sit at his father's right hand

With a bible and a gun
The word of God lay heavy on my heart
I was sure I was the one

Johnny Cash,"I don't want no aggravation
When my train has left the station
If you're there or not, I may not even know
Have a round and remember
Things we did that weren't so tender

On my old guitar sell tickets
So someone can finally pick it
And tell the girls down at the Ritz I said hello
Tell the gossipers and liars
I will see them in the fire

Let her blow, let her blow
Long and loud and hard and happy
Let her blow

When I get laid
Let her blow, let her blow, let her blow

For the evils and abuses
Down today from years and years ago

Johnny Cash,"With the twilight colors falling
And the evening laying shadows
Hidden memories come stealing from my mind
And I feel my own heart beating out
The simple joy of living
And I wonder how I ever was that kind

But the wild road I was rambling
Was always out there calling
And you said a hundred times I should have died
Then you reached down and touched me 
And I lifted me up with you 
So, I believe it was a road that I was meant to ride

I'm like a soldier getting over the war
I'm like a young man getting over his crazy days
Like a bandit getting over his lawless ways
I don't have to do that anymore
I'm like a soldier getting over the war

There are nights I don't remember
And pain that it's been forgotten
And a lot of things I choose not to recall
There are faces that come to me
In my darkest secret memories
Faces that I wish would not come back at all

But in my dreams parade of lovers 
From the other times and places
There's not one that matters now, no matter who
I'm just thankful for the journey
And that I've survived the battles
And that's my spoils of victory is you

I'm like a soldier getting over the war
I'm like a young man getting over his crazy days
Like a bandit getting over his lawless ways
Everyday gets betther than the day before
I'm like a soldier getting over the war",Like a Soldier,1994
Johnny Cash,"There once was a man and he couldn't cry 
He hadn't cried for years and for years
Napalmed babies, movie love stories
For instance could not produce tears
As a child he had cried as all children will
Then at some point his tear ducts all ran dry
Grew to be a man, it all hit the fan
Things got bad, but he couldn't cry

His dog got ran over, his wife up and left him
After that he got sacked from his job
Lost his arm in the war, was laughed at by a whore
Ah, but still not a sniffle or sob

Well, his novel was refused, and his movie was panned
His big Broadway show was a flop

He got sent off to jail, you guessed it, no bail
Oh, but still not a dribble or a drop

In jail he was beaten, bullied and buggered
And made to make license plates
Water and bread was all he was fed
Not once did a tear stain his face

Doctors were called in, scientists, too
Theologians were last and practically least

They all agreed sure enough, this is no cream puff
Oh, but in fact an insensitive beast

He was taken from the jail and placed in a place
For the insensitive and the insane
He made a lot of friends and he played a lot of chess
And he cried every time it would rain

Once it rained forty days and it rained forty nights
And he cried and he cried and he cried and he cried

On the forty first day, he passed away
He just dehydrated and died

He went up to heaven, located his dog
After that, he rejoined his arm
Below all the critics, they took it all back
Cancer robbed the whore of her charm

His ex-wife died of stretch marks 
His ex-employer went broke
The theologians were finally found out

Right down to the ground, the jail house burned down
And the earth suffered perpetual drought",The Man Who Couldn't Cry [Live],1994
Johnny Cash,"Lord, I've never lived where churches grow 
I loved creation better as it stood 
That day you finished it so long ago 
And looked upon your work and called it good 
I know that others find you in the light 
That sifted down through tinted window panes 
And yet I seem to feel you near tonight 
In this dim, quiet starlight on the plains 

I thank you, Lord, that I'm placed so well 
That you've made my freedom so complete 
That I'm no slave to whistle, clock or bell 
Nor weak eyed prisoner of Waller Street 
Just let me live my life as I've begun 
And give me work that's open to the sky 
Make me a partner of the wind and sun 
And I won't ask a life that's soft or high 

Let me be easy on the man that's down 
Let me be square and generous with all 
I'm careless sometimes, Lord, when I'm in town 
But never let them say I'm mean or small 
Make me as big and open as the plains 
And honest as the horse between my knees 
Clean as a wind that blows behind the rains 
Free as the hawk that circles down the breeze 

Forgive me, Lord, if sometimes I forget 
You know about the reasons that are hid 
You understand the things that gall or fret 
Well, you knew me better than my mother did 
Just keep an eye on all that's done or said 
And right me sometimes when I turn aside 
And guide me on that long, dim trail ahead 
That stretches upward toward the great divide

Oh, bury me not on the lone prairie 
These words came low and mournfully 
From the pallid lips of a youth who lay 
On his dying bed at the close of day

Oh, bury me not and his voice failed there 
But we took no heed to his dying prayer 
In a shallow grave just six by three 
We buried him there on the lone prairie","Oh, Bury Me Not (Introduction: A Cowboy's Prayer)",1994
Johnny Cash,"From the hands it came down
From the side it came down
From the feet it came down
And ran to the ground
Between heaven and hell
A teardrop fell
In the deep crimson dew
The tree of life grew

And the blood gave life
To the branches of the tree
And the blood was the price
That set captives free
And the numbers that came
Through the fire and the flood
Clung to the tree
And were redeemed by the blood

From the tree streamed a light
That started the fight
'Round the tree grew a vine
On whose fruit I could dine
My old friend Lucifer came
Fought to keep me in chains
But I saw through the tricks
Of six-sixty-six

Said ""You do have a choice""

And I clung to the tree

And the blood gave life
To the branches of the tree
And the blood was the price
That set captives free

With no way to hold my head that didn't hurt 
And the beer I had for breakfast wasn't bad
So I had one more for dessert 

Then I fumbled in my closet through my clothes 
And found my cleanest dirty shirt 
Then I washed my face and combed my hair 
And stumbled down the stairs to meet the day 

I'd smoked my mind the night before 
With cigarettes and songs I'd been picking 
But I lit my first and watched a small kid 
Playing with a can that he was kicking 

Then I walked across the street 
And caught the Sunday smell of someone frying chicken 
And Lord, it took me back to something that I'd lost 
Somewhere, somehow along the way 

On a Sunday morning sidewalk
I'm wishing, Lord, that I was stoned 
'Cause there's something in a Sunday 
That makes a body feel alone 

And there's nothing short a' dying 
That's half as lonesome as the sound 
Of the sleeping city sidewalk 
And Sunday morning coming down 

In the park I saw a daddy 
With a laughing little girl that he was swinging 
And I stopped beside a Sunday school 
And listened to the songs they were singing 

Then I headed down the street, 
And somewhere far away a lonely bell was ringing
And it echoed through the canyon 
Like the disappearing dreams of yesterday 

On a Sunday morning sidewalk
I'm wishing, Lord, that I was stoned

I drove on out to Grapevine and picked old Mavis up
We hit that county line for one quick round
On the night Hank Williams came to town

A thousand people sweltered in the gym
Then I heard someone whisper hey, that's him
That's when the crowd let out this deafening sound
It was the night Hank Williams came to town

On and on he sang into the night
'Jambalaya', 'Cheatin' heart', I saw the light
How'd they get Miss Audrey in that gown
On the night Hank Williams came to town

Mavis had her picture made with Hank outside his car
She said he sure is humble for a Grand Old Opry Star
Mavis said why don't we hang around

Mavis got acquainted with the Driftin' Cowboys Band

The end of a hundred year Waltz
The voices sound sad as they're singin' along
Another piece of America's lost

He rides the feed lots, clerks in the markets
On weekends sellin' tobacco and beer
And his dreams of tomorrow, surrounded by fences
But he'll dream tonight of when fences weren't here

He blazed the trail with Lewis and Clark
And eyeball to eyeball, old Wyatt backed down
He stood shoulder to shoulder with Travis in Texas
And rode with the 7th when Custer went down

This is the last cowboy song
The end of a hundred year Waltz
The voices sound sad as they're singin' along
Another piece of America's lost

Remington showed us how he looked on canvas
And Louis Lamour has told us his tale
Me and Johnny and Waylon and Kris sing about him
And wish to God, we could have ridden his trail

One foot on Jacob's ladder
And one foot in the fire
And it all goes down in your mind

Living at the bottom of the stairs in your life
Never a smile knocking on your door
The air is blue and so are you
Prehistoric monsters on the floor

Last verse of your last song
And God don't hear dead men
The end of the line is in your mind
And you'll be staying in

In your mind, in your mind
Bone for bone and skin for skin
Eye for eye and tooth for tooth
Heart for heart and soul for soul
Somebody said what is true

Lock it up and close it down
The sound of morning like a dove
High beyond the rattle and roar
Look into the face of love

In your mind, in your mind
One foot on Jacob's ladder
And one foot in the fire
And it all goes down in your mind

In your mind, in your mind
Sunday words are back again
And you'll eat your fun of the middleman's pie
But just a piece you understand
You'll get the rest up in the sky

Praise and glory, wounded angel
Shuffling round the room
Eternity is down the hall
And you sit there bending spoons

In your mind, in your mind
Father, son and holy ghost
Sacrificial drops the pain
On a silver planet cross
Sanctification on a chain

They say redemption draws knives
Storms of silence from above
Stop your ears close your eyes
Try to find the face of love

In your mind, in your mind
One foot on Jacob's ladder
And one foot in the fire
And it all goes down in your mind

Take a walk just a little ways
And as we walked, along we talk
All would be our wedding day

And only say that you'll be mine
In no others arms entwined
Down beside where the waters flow
Down by the banks of the Ohio

I asked her if she'd marry me
And my wife forever be
She only turned her head away
And had no other words to say

And only say that you'll be mine
In no others arms entwined
Down beside where the waters flow
Down by the banks of the Ohio

I plunged a knife into her breast
And told her she was going to rest
She cried ""Oh Willy, don't murder me
I'm not prepared for eternity""

I took her by her golden curls
And drug her down to the river side
And there I threw her into drown
And I watched her as she floated down

And only say that you'll be mine
In no others arms entwined
Down beside where the waters flow
Down by the banks of the Ohio

And going home between twelve and one
I cried ""Oh Lord, what have I've done?""

Because she would not marry me

Your lips and mine, two sips of wine
Memories are made of this
Then add the wedding bells, one house where lovers dwell 
Three little kids for the flavor
Stir carefully through the day
See how the flavor stays 
These are the dreams that we will savor

With His blessings from above
Serve it generously with love

And run his fingers through seventy years of livin'
And wonder, ""Lord, has ever' well I've drilled run dry?""

Like desperados waitin' for a train
Like desperados waitin' for a train

He's a drifter and a driller of oil wells
And an old school man of the world
He let me drive his car
When he's too drunk to

And he'd wink and give me money for the girls
And our lives were like some old western movie
Like desperados waitin' for a train
Like desperados waitin' for a train

From the time that I could walk he'd take me with him
To a bar called the Green Frog Cafe
There were old men with beer guts and dominos
Lying 'bout their lives while they'd played

And I was just a kid
They all called his ""Sidekick""
Like desperados waitin' for a train
Like desperados waitin' for a train

One day I looked up and he's pushin' eighty
And there's brown tobacco stains all down his chin
To me he's one of the heroes of this country
So why's he all dressed up like them old men

Drinkin' beer and playin' Moon and Forty-two
Like desperados waitin' for a train
Like desperados waitin' for a train

A day before he died, I went to see him
I was grown and he was almost gone
So we just closed our eyes and dreamed us up a kitchen
And sang another verse to that old song

Along the coach roads I did ride
With sword and pistol by my side
Many a young maid lost her baubles to my trade
Many a soldier shed his lifeblood on my blade
The bastards hung me in the spring of twenty-five
But I am still alive.

I was a sailor.
I was born upon the tide
And with the sea I did abide.
I sailed a schooner round the Horn to Mexico
I went aloft and furled the mainsail in a blow
And when the yards broke off they said that I got killed
But I am living still.

I was a dam builder.
Across the river deep and wide
Where steel and water did collide
A place called Boulder on the wild Colorado
I slipped and fell into the wet concrete below
They buried me in that great tob that knows no sound
But I am still around
I'll always be around
And around and around and around and around.

I fly a star ship.
Across the Universe divide
And when I reach the other side
I'll find a place to rest my spirit if I can
Perhaps I may become a highwayman again
Or I may simply be a single drop of rain
But I will remain
And I'll be back again, and again and again and again and again...",Highwayman [Live],1998

Johnny Cash,"I'm sorry to say that you don't know me
I'm sad in ways you never understood
Each time I try to tell the ugly truth, you always let it pass you by
You said I 'd never tell you a lie, just because I could

Did you really think I was a bad man?
You always said that, that should be my middle name
But you don't know the half of it, you don't know how that name fits
You don't know my hidden shame

Hidden shame, shame, shame
That I can't get free
From the blame and the torture and the misery
Must it be my secret for eternity?
Till you know my hidden shame you really don't know me

Well, there's a different kind of prison
And it don't even have to look much like a cell
It's already on your mind boy, we can see it in your eyes
So, here's the bars and walls as well

Well, you know I'm never coming home, babe
You said you'd stand by me until I cleared my name
Sure it's easy to be strong when you know the charge is wrong
But the days and weeks get long
When you've got a hidden shame

Hidden shame, shame, shame
That I can't get free
From the blame and the torture and the misery
Must it be my secret for eternity?
Till you know my hidden shame you really don't know me

I had a friend when I was just a boy
We were like brothers, we would run and hide
And we went walking on a high hillside
And I really don't know how it happened

He turned to me and had this strange look in his eye
And not a single word was spoken
I must have pushed him, but I don't remember why?
And all at once, he lay there broken
And I walked down without him and I didn't even sigh

Hidden shame, shame, shame
That I can't get free
From the blame and the torture and the misery
Must it be my secret for eternity?
Till you know my hidden shame you really don't know me

They say you always hurt the one you love
And I'm not saying if I did or if I didn't
But like my shame, that kind of love is always hidden
They locked me up here for the ideas in my head
They never got me for the thing I really did

Hidden shame, shame, shame
That I can't get free
From the blame and the torture and the misery
Must it be my secret for eternity?
Till you know my hidden shame you really don't know me
You really don't know me, you really don't know me

Looking from a window above
It's like a story of love
Can you hear me.
Came back only yesterday
Moving further away
Won't you hear me.

All I needed was the love you gave
All I needed for another day
All I ever knew
Only you

Sometimes when I think of your name
And it's only a game
And I need you
Listening to the words that you say
Getting harder to stay
When I see you

All I needed was the love you gave
All I needed for another day

And I wonder what's mine

Wonder if you'll understand

Johnny Cash,"I come to the garden alone
While the dew is still on the roses
And the voice I hear, falling on my ear
The Son of God discloses
And he walks with me
And he talks with me

[Chorus]
And he tells me I am His own
And the joy we share as we tarry there
None other has ever known

He speaks and the sound of His voice
Is so sweet the birds hush their singing
And the melody that He gave to me
Within my heart is ringing
And he walks with me
And he talks with me

[Chorus]

I'd stay in the garden with Him

And He talks with me

Johnny Cash,"My grandfather's clock was too large for the shelf
So it stood ninety years on the floor
It was taller by half than the old man himself
Though it weighed not a pennyweight more

It was bought on the morn of the day that he was born
And was always his treasure and pride
But it stopped, short never to go again
When the old man died

Ninety years without slumbering
His life seconds numbering
It stopped, short never to go again
When the old man died

My grandfather said that of those he could hire
Not a servant so faithful he found
For it wasted no time and had but one desire
At the close of each week to be wound

And it kept in its place, not a frown upon its face
And its hands never hung by its side
But it stopped short, never to go again
When the old man died

It rang and alarmed in the dead of the night
An alarm that for years had been dumb
And we knew that his spirit was pluming for flight
That his hour for departure had come

Still the clock kept the time with a soft and muffled chime
As we silently stood by his side
But it stopped short, never to go again

Johnny Cash,"Moses led God's children out to find the promised land
And on the way he'd stop each day and look to Heaven and
Asked God for help as he could not withstand the task alone
And then one day he looked away and thereby lay a stone
God said write upon this stone these words I say to you
And if you all obey my rules I'll see you safely through
God opened Heaven's door and then He guided Moses' hands
And then He said go and tell my children these are my commands
Go and climb that mountain Moses climb that mountain now and pray
Climb that mountain now and tell us what our Lord has had to say
Thou shalt have no Gods before me is my great command
And thou shalt not make any graven image by thy hand
Thou shalt not take my name in vain if thou would guiltless be
Remember thou to keep the sabbath day alone for me
Honor thy father and thy mother and thou shalt not kill
Thou shalt not commit adult'ry and thou shalt not steal
Love thy neighbor as thyself and show thy neighbor peace
Covet not thy neighbor's house nor anything that's his
Go and climb that mountain...
Moses showed these words of God to all the children then
They pulled up stakes and headed out to find the promised land
That Moses had described to them and told of comforts there
The children of oppression thought they'd not find anywhere
But they were soon to part from him and push alone awhile
For it was never meant for him to walk that final mile
The children cried if we must go on Moses without you
Then talk to God just one more time and tell us what to do
Go and climb that mountain...
Thou shalt have no Gods before me...

But she loved the boy next door who worked at the candy store

He would marry her next spring
Saved his money, bought a ring
Then one day a movie scout
Came to town to take her out (Came to town to take her out)
Hollywood could offer more
So she left the boy next door working at the candy store
(Dream on, dream on teenage queen see you on the movie screen)

Very soon she was a star
Pretty house and shiny car
Swimming pool and a fence around
But she missed her old home town (But she missed her old home town)
All the world was at her door
All except the boy next door who worked at the candy store

Then one day the teenage star
Sold her house and all her cars
Gave up all her wealth and fame
Left it all and caught a train (Left it all and caught a train)

But he's got the dirtiest job in town
Bendin' low at the peoples' feet
On the windy corner of a dirty street

How'd he keep from gettin' the blues
He grinned as he raised his little head
Popped a shoeshine rag and then he said.

It'll shake all the troubles from your worried mind,

Well, I sat down to listen to the shoeshine boy
And I thought I was gonna jump with joy
Slapped on the shoe polish left and right
He took a shoeshine rag and he held it tight
He stopped once to wipe the sweat away
I said you're a mighty little boy to be-a workin' that way
He said I like it with a big wide grin
Kept on a poppin' and he said again

And tearful words that rhyme

There were songs in old dusty books
Of love thats always been

Their love burns just like mine

Before my time
Before my time

And in the dim of yesterday
I can clearly see
That flesh and blood cried out to someone
As it does in me
And there was some old song that said
I love you 'til I die

Before my time
Before my time

But what the old time masters had
Is what I feel for you

Johnny Cash,"It was on one cold winter night
When the wind blew across the wild moor
When Mary came wandering home with a child
Till she came to her own father's door
""Father, dear father,"" she cried
""Come down and open the door
Or the child in my arms will perish and die
From the winds that blow across the wild moor.""

But her father was deaf to her cry
Not a sound of a voice did he hear
So the watchdog did howl and the village bells tolled
And the wind blew across the wild moor

Oh, how the old man must have felt
When he came to the door the next morn'
And he found Mary dead but the child still alive
Closely grasping its dead mother's arms

In grief, the old man passed away
And the child, to it's mother, went soon
And no one, they say, lives there to this day
And the cottage, to ruin, has gone

Where the willows grew over the door

He called his Babylon ""Paradise."" 
On his throne he drank and ate, 
But for Belshazzar it was gettin' late. 

For he was weighed in the balance and found wanting, 
His kingdom was divided, couldn't stand. 
He was weighed in the balance and found wanting, 
His houses were built upon the sand. 

Well, the people feasted and drank their wine
And praised the false gods of his time. 
All holy things they scorned and mocked, 
But suddenly all their mocking stopped. 
For on the wall, there appeared a hand, 
Nothin' else, there was no man. 
In blood the hand began to write, 
And Belshazzar couldn't hide his fright. 

For he was weighed in the balance and found wanting, 
His kingdom was divided, couldn't stand.

Johnny Cash,"I studied at the feet of a master
Gamaliel we called him, the beauty of the law
I was born of the Tribe of Benjamin, I was a Pharisee
And I could quote from memory the Holy Torah

That day that the Nazarene was brought to trial
It was on a Sabbath eve, there was a earthquake when He died
Just another passing preacher who came up from Galilee
Blaspheming trouble-maker, we let Him be crucified

Then I thought that I would hear no more about him
But his friends found his tomb empty
Claimed that he rose from the dead
Then they said he walked among them
With the nail wounds in his hands
That King upon a donkey with a thorn crown on his head

His followers kept growing in great number
And the one that they call Caiaphas mocked us in the judgment hall
And with the Greek name Stephen, we knew the gentiles had come in
I cast my vote against him, he was stoned I saw him fall

Then the friends of the Nazarene became united
And I became enraged then led a slaughter zealously
I found their secret places, they were beaten, they were chained
But some of them were scattered, justified in fearing me

Then the Man in White, appeared to me
In such a blinding light it struck me down
With it's brilliance, took away my sight, then the Man in White
In gentle loving tone spoke to me
And I was blinded so that I might see, the Man in White

But like the wind that blows the scattered sea
From Alexandria to Antioch their congregation grew
I went to the high priest for letters of permission
To go to other cities, to see my mission through

Six days on the hot road to the masters
And just outside the city in the middle of the day
A great unearthly light struck and overpowered me
Prostrate on the hot road, I was blinded were I laid

Then I thought I heard the rushing of great water
And a multitude of angels singing sweet and heavenly
And through the sound of wind, came a voice so soft and kind
Meant for only me to hear, ""Saul, why do you persecute me?""

As I lay there on the ground, in my blindness
He asked me once again, and suddenly the voice I knew
So finally I managed, a trembling response
Who are you Lord? I asked him, but I already knew

I am Jesus of Nazareth the voice answered
Arise go to Damascus on the street called Straight will be
A place where you will wait for my servant Ananias
He will open up your eyes, you'll be a witness unto me

So now I live to serve my master
As zealous in his service as I once was as his foe
And keeping his commandments given on Damascus road
I go to all the world, and I let the whole world know

In such a blinding light it struck me down

Upon a ridge he rested as he went along his way
When all at once a mighty herd of red-eyed cows he saw
Plowin' through the ragged skies and up a cloudy draw

Their brands were still on fire and their hooves were made of steel
Their horns were black and shiny and their hot breath he could feel
A bolt of fear went through him as they thundered through the sky
For he saw the riders comin' hard and he heard their mournful cries

Yippie I ohhh ohh ohh
Yippie I aye ye ye
Ghost riders in the sky

Their faces gaunt, their eyes were blurred
Their shirts all soaked with sweat
He's ridin hard to catch that herd
But he ain't caught em yet
'Cause they got to ride forever in that range up in the sky

I find myself alone when each day is through
Yes, I'll admit that I'm a fool for you
Because you're mine, I walk the line

As sure as night is dark and day is light
I keep you on my mind both day and night
And happiness I've known proves that it's right
Because you're mine, I walk the line

You've got a way to keep me on your side
You give me cause for love that I can't hide
For you I know I'd even try to turn the tide
Because you're mine, I walk the line

I keep a close watch on this heart of mine
I keep my eyes wide open all the time
I keep the ends out for the tie that binds

Johnny Cash,"Jacob Green got busted for possession
Next morning early he appeared in court
But he was sent to jail to wait to be trialed at some later date
Next morning early, there came a sad report

At the jail they took away his clothes to shame him
And to make sure Jacob Green had no pride left
They cut of all his hair today they found him hanging there
Afraid to face the day he killed himself

It happened yesterday and if you turn your head away
Somewhere in some dirty hole the scene will be rerun
Not only Jacob Green, but many more you've never seen

It could be someone that you love gets done
Like Jacob Green got done
It could be someone that you love gets done
Like Jacob Green got done

Jacob's father hired a team of lawyers
Inspections and long inquiries were held
The sheriff then retired and the papers said two guards were fired
They put a brand new coat of paint on Jacob's cell

But like a tomb that looks so white and shiny
Inside you'll find corruption never seen
And somewhere out there tonight in a dirty cell without a light
There will be locked up another Jacob Green

It happened yesterday and if you turn your head away
Somewhere in some dirty hole the scene will be rerun
Not only Jacob Green, but many more you've never seen

It could be someone that you love gets done
Like Jacob Green got done
It could be someone that you love gets done
Like Jacob Green got done

Who ruled Babylon and all its land. 
Around the city, he built a wall
And declared that Babylon would never fall. 
He had concubines and wives, 
He called his Babylon ""Paradise."" 
On his throne he drank and ate, 
But for Belshazzar it was gettin' late. 

For he was weighed in the balance and found wanting, 
His kingdom was divided, couldn't stand. 
He was weighed in the balance and found wanting, 
His houses were built upon the sand. 

Well, the people feasted and drank their wine
And praised the false gods of his time. 
All holy things they scorned and mocked, 
But suddenly all their mocking stopped. 
For on the wall, there appeared a hand, 
Nothin' else, there was no man. 
In blood the hand began to write, 
And Belshazzar couldn't hide his fright. 

For he was weighed in the balance and found wanting, 
His kingdom was divided, couldn't stand. 
He was weighed in the balance and found wanting, 
His houses were built upon the sand. 

Well, no one around could understand
What was written by the mystic hand. 
Belshazzar tried, but couldn't find
A man who could give him peace of mind. 
But Daniel, the prophet, a man of God, 
He saw the writing on the wall in blood. 
Belshazzar asked him what it said, 
And Daniel turned to the wall and read: 

""My friend, you're weighed in the balance and found wanting, 
Your kingdom is divided, it can't stand. 
You're weighed in the balance and found wanting, 
Your houses are built upon the sand.""",Belshazzar [Undubbed Version],2001

I went right home and I went to bed
I stuck that lovin' forty-four beneath my head.

Got up next mornin' and I grabbed that gun
Took a shot of cocaine and away I run
Made a good run but I run too slow

In walked a sheriff from Jericho Hill

They put me on a train and they took me back
Had no friends for to go my bail

I spied a sheriff comin' down the line
Coughed and coughed as he cleared his throat
He said come on you dirty hack into that district court

Into the court room my trial began
Where I was handled by twelve honest men
Just before the jury started out
I saw that little judge commence to look about.

In about five minutes in walked a man
Holding the verdict in his right hand
The verdict read in the first degree	
I hollered Lordy Lordy have mercy on me

You win again
Yes this heart of mine could never see
What everybody knows but me

Just trusting in you was my great sin
What can I do
You win again",You Win Again,2001
Johnny Cash,"I'm back on board that '49 Ford in 1956
Long before the sun came up way out in the sticks
The headlight showed a two rut roadway, back up in the pines
First time I heard Johnny Cash sing I walk the line

I got my thrill behind the wheel upon my daddy?s lap
Grandpa rode co-pilot with a flashlight and a map
Cane pole out the window it was in the summertime
First time I heard Johnny Cash sing I walk the line

I keep a close watch on this heart of mine
I keep my eyes wide open all the time
I keep the ends out for the tie that binds
Because you're mine, I walk the line

I never will forget that day, I know the time and place
Sounded like the whole thing came right down from outer space
I still can see those headlights and that dashboard in my mind
The first time I heard Johnny Cash sing I walk the line

I find it very, very easy to be true
I find myself alone when each day's through
Yes, I'll admit that I'm a fool for you
Because you're mine, I walk the line

All these long years later it's still music to my ears
I swear it sounds as good right now as anything I hear
I've seen the Mona Lisa, I've heard Shakespeare read real fine
Just like hearing Johnny Cash sing I walk the line

As sure as night is dark and day is light
I keep you on my mind both day and night
And happiness I've know proves that it's right
Because you're mine, I walk the line

Because you're mine, I walk the line

To see what they'd done
And we'll ride together

When time goes crawling by.

To hide its face and cry.

Did you ever see a Robin weep,
When leaves begin to die?
That means he's lost his will to live.

Lights up a purple sky.

One of the four beasts saying,
'Come and see.' and I saw, and behold a white horse""

There's a man goin' 'round takin' names
And he decides who to free and who to blame
Everybody won't be treated all the same
There'll be a golden ladder reachin' down
When the man comes around

The hairs on your arm will stand up
At the terror in each sip and in each sup
Will you partake of that last offered cup
Or disappear into the potter's ground?
When the man comes around

Hear the trumpets hear the pipers
One hundred million angels singin'
Multitudes are marchin' to the big kettledrum
Voices callin', voices cryin'
Some are born and some are dyin'
It's alpha and omega's kingdom come
And the whirlwind is in the thorn tree
The virgins are all trimming their wicks
The whirlwind is in the thorn tree
It's hard for thee to kick against the pricks

Till armageddon no shalam, no shalom
Then the father hen will call his chickens home
The wise man will bow down before the throne
And at his feet they'll cast their golden crowns
When the man comes around

Whoever is unjust let him be unjust still
Whoever is righteous let him be righteous still
Whoever is filthy let him be filthy still
Listen to the words long written down
When the man comes around

Hear the trumpets hear the pipers
One hundred million angels singin'
Multitudes are marchin' to the big kettledrum
Voices callin', voices cryin'
Some are born and some are dyin'
It's alpha and omega's kingdom come
And the whirlwind is in the thorn tree
The virgins are all trimming their wicks
The whirlwind is in the thorn trees
It's hard for thee to kick against the prick
In measured hundredweight and penny pound

I could see that he was nearly dead
I knelt down beside him and I listened
Just to hear the words the dying fellow said

He said they let me out of prison down in Frisco
For ten long years I've paid for what I've done
I was trying to get back to Louisiana
To see my Rose and get to know my son

Give my love to Rose please won't you mister
Take her all my money, tell her to buy some pretty clothes
Tell my boy his daddy's so proud of him
And don't forget to give my love to Rose

Won't you tell them I said thanks for waiting for me
Tell my boy to help his mom at home
Tell my Rose to try to find another
'Cause it ain't right that she should live alone

Mister here's a bag with all my money
It won't last them long the way it goes
God bless you for finding me this morning

Johnny Cash,"Me and my brother was down close to the depot
When I heard the report of a pistol
I hollered, ""I wonder what was that!""

He run out and come back and he said
""That was a report of a pistol""

And I thought I was gonna faint when he said it
""Mr. Garfield's been shot down, shot down, shot down
Mr. Garfield's been shot down low""

Lord, I knew the President was supposed to be down the depot that day
But I just wouldn't let myself believe that he'd been shot

Me and my bother run out there and everybody was all confused
And hollering' and running' round
And I stepped up to this one lady and I said that

""Ma'am what was it really that happened Ma'am?"", and she said that
""Mr. Garfield's been shot down, shot down, shot down
Mr. Garfield's been shot down low""

Well, it looked like everybody felt just about as bad as I did
Everybody started drift off to home
Me and my brother did too

Then a few weeks later, I heard that the President was still alive
So I told my brother, I said, ""Hey let's get on a train
And go to that Big House up there and see how the President is""

""Let's go up there to where he's laid up hurt and sick we'd see him""
So we went on up there and that big White House
And there was a soldier boy standin' round upside, outside

And, I sidled up to him and I said to that soldier boy
I said ""Who was it that did it?
Who was it that shot the President?""
And he said that, ""It was Charlie Guiteau that shot Mr. Garfield""

And I said, ""Charlie Guiteau done shot down a good man, good man
Charlie Guiteau done shot down a good man low
Charlie Guiteau done shot down a good man, good man""

That soldier boy said that
Miss Lucretia Garfield was always at his bedside
In the heat of the day fannin' him when he was hot

And he said just that mornin' that he had been at the window
And he'd overheard Miss Lucretia and Mr. Garfield talkin'
And Mr Garfield said, ""Crete, honey"", he called her Crete

He said, ""Crete, honey, if somethin' worse would happens to me""
He said, ""You get yourself a good man""
And she said, ""Now James"", she called him James

She said, ""James, I won't hear to that now
'Cause I love you too much""

And he said that ""You'll make some good man a good wife, good wife
You'll make some man a good wife gal
Don't pull in single harness all your life, good gal
Don't pull in single harness all your life""

That's what he said, ""Don't pull in single harness all your life""

Well a little while later, we come back around there
And things have changed
The flag was hangin' halfway up the flagpole

And everybody was cryin' and standin' 'round sad
And I walked back up to this soldier boy and I said
""Soldier boy, is he, is Mr Garfield?"" and he said, ""Yeah, he's gone""

Gonna lay him by that cold lonesome branch down low
Mr. Garfield's been shot down low
Oh, Mr. Garfield's been shot down, shot down, shot down
Mr. Garfield's been shot down low

Have you heard the news?
Mr. Garfield's been shot down, shot down, shot down
Mr. Garfield's been shot down low, Lord

Were all signed, and a million copies made, 
They all shook hands and
Bowed their heads and grateful prayers were prayed

In the streets below were dancing round and round

Illinois Central, Monday mornin' rail
15 cars and 15 restless riders
Three conductors, 25 sacks of mail

All along the southbound odyssey the train pulls out of Kankakee
Rolls along past houses, farms & fields
Passin' graves that have no name, freight yards full of old black men
And the graveyards of rusted automobiles

[Chorus]
Good mornin' America, how are you?
Don't you know me? I'm your native son!
I'm the train they call the City of New Orleans
I'll be gone 500 miles when the day is done

Dealin' cards with the old men in the club car
Penny a point, ain't no one keepin' score
Pass the paper bag that holds the bottle
And feel the wheels grumblin' neath the floor

And the sons of Pullman porters & the sons of engineers
Ride their fathers' magic carpet made of steel
Mothers with their babes asleep, rockin' to the gentle beat
And the rhythm of the rails is all they feel

Changin' cars in Memphis, Tennessee
Halfway home, we'll be there by mornin'

Late one night when he was workin' graveyard Harley got himself this big
idea
All he's have to do is change one little screw a save millions of dollars a
year
So he worked and he saved till he could open his own shop
Money started rollin' in like it wasn't gonna stop
So Harley bought a mountain built a mansion on top
So the losers could see whom was winnin'

king

owned
Then Harley junior joined some kind of rockband
And walked around all day about half stoned
His wife watched TV all the time cause she got bored
Then one day she found a TV preacher she adored
And she gave all of Harley's hard earned money to the Lord
Harley started drinkin' wound up in Betty Ford to see if he could by a
happy ending
Then some kid who worked in Harley's factory he got himself this big idea
Figured out how to do it with compures drove Harley out of business in a
year
Now Harley's back working the assembly line
Just gettin' by with a little bit of overtime

And you go to the Starkville City jail.

Well, they threw me in the car and started driving into town;
I said: ""What the hell did I do?""
He said: ""Shut up and sit down.""

Well, they emptied out my pockets, took my pills and guitar picks.
I said: ""Wait, my name is..."" ""Ah, shut up.""
Well, I sure was in a fix.

The sergeant put me in a cell, then he went home for the night;
I said: ""Come back here, you so and so;
I ain't bein' treated right.""

Well, they're bound to get you.
'Cause they got a curfew.
And you go to the Starkville City jail.

I started pacin' back and forth, and now and then I'd yell,
And kick my forty dollar shoes against the steel floor of my cell.
I'd walk awhile and kick awhile, and all night nobody came.

Then I sadly remembered that they didn't even take my name.
At 8 a.m. they let me out, I said: ""Gimme them things of mine!""
They gave me a sneer and a guitar pick, and a yellow dandelion.

They're bound to get you.

And when we cross that White Oak Mountain watch old 97 roll 
 
But it's a mighty rough road from Lynchburg to Danville 
With a line on a three mile grade 
It was on that grade that he lost his air brakes see what a jump he made 
He was goin' down the grade makin' 90 miles an hour his whistle broke into a scream 
He was found in the wreck with his hand on the throttle

Where the willow grew

Where the silver leaf of maple
Sparkled in the morning dew
I braided twigs of willows
Made a string of buckeye beads
But flesh and blood needs flesh and blood
And you're the one I need
Flesh and blood needs flesh and blood
And you're the one I need

I leaned against a bark of birch
And I breathed the honey dew
I saw a North-bound flock of geese
Against a sky of baby blue
Beside the lily pads
I carved a whistle from a reed
Mother Nature's quite a lady
But you're the one I need
Flesh and blood needs flesh and blood
And you're the one I need

A cardinal sang just for me
And I thanked him for the song
Then the sun went slowly down the west
And I had to move along
These were some of the things
On which my mind and spirit feed
But flesh and blood need flesh and blood
And you're the one I need
Flesh and blood needs flesh and blood
And you're the one I need

So when this day was ended
I was still not satisfied
For I knew everything I touched
Would wither and would die
And love is all that will remain
And grow from all these seeds

But you're the one I need
Flesh and blood needs flesh and blood
And you're the one I need",Flesh and Blood [From the Movie I Walk the Line],2002

Johnny Cash,"Now you know some fellahs, they want fame and fortune
Yeah, and other fellahs they just wanna swing
But all I wanted all my life
Was a TV set and a truck and a wife
And a front row seat to hear ole Johnny sing.

Yeah the TV and the truck I got on credit.
And I got that girl with a little old Woolworth ring
And life was warm and life was sweet
But still, it was kinda incomplete
Without a front row seat to hear ole Johnny sing.

chorus:
Hey, John you walk the line,
Do ""Deelia"" one more time
And when you do them Cottonfields
You warm this heart of mine.

So, one day I thought, Hey, I'm gonna do it!
(That's what I said)
So, I mortgaged the farm and pawned her wedding ring.
I sold the gold tooth out of my mouth
And jumped in the pickup and headed South.
For a front row seat to hear ole Johnny sing.

I hit Nashville cold and wet and hungry.
I said, ""I'm here, bring him on let him do his thing.""
But they told me down at the Old Pit Grill
I'd have to go all the way to Andersonville
For a front row seat to hear ole Jonny sing.

I found his house knocked on the door and it was opened
By a brown-haired girl and a baby with a teethin' ring.
I said ""I seen you somewhere before
But don't stand there and block the door
I want a front row seat to hear ole Johnny sing.""

(chorus)

She said I'd have to go down to The Opry
And the feller there said I'd have to wait till Spring.
He said, ""We've been sold out for months and months
And this poor insane fellah wants
A front row seat to hear ole Johnny sing.""

Well, he said a couple more things, and I started cryin'
And then he laughed at me and that's when I started to swing.
Well I bust through the doors in a roaring rage,
Crawled over the crowd till I reached the stage
For a front row seat to hear ole Johnny sing.

(chrous)

Then some crazy guard started shootin'
I shot back, and the next thing I know I was winged
And on the floor
When a guy in a voice kinda deep and low
Says, ""Boy that's a mighty long way to go
For a front row seat to hear ANYBODY sing.""

And I guess that judge, he weren't no music lover.
I got fifteen months but that don't mean a thing.
'cause' yesterday in the prison yard
A show come through and HAR! de HAR!
I had a front row seat to hear ole Johnny sing.

And his head just fell down on his chest

A little bit harder to handle and yet""

In favor of being a girl about town

One night I had a backstage pass
To a Willie Nelson show

There were wackoes and weirdoes and dingbats and dodoes
And athletes and movie stars and David Allan Coe
There was leather and lace and every minority race
With a backstage pass to the Willie Nelson show

Kristofferson got an offer for a movie
Promoters closed another deal or two
Waylon got a call from his son Shooter
And he went home the minute he was through

I moved with the mob at intermission
To the green room where you see who you can see
There were has-been's and would-be's and never-were's
Paupers, punks and millionaires and me

And there were wackoes and weirdoes and dingbats and dodoes
And athletes and movie stars and David Allan Coe
There was leather and lace and every minority race
With a backstage pass to the Willie Nelson show

Hell's Angels blocked the traffic to the building
In order for the beer truck to come through
And waitin' in the wings to sing with Willie
Were hopeful stars of flickering magnitude

There was a singer Willie knew back in the fifties
Who once paid him fifty dollars for a song
There were women who once did and some who still would
I heard one ask, ""Did Connie come along?""

And there were wackoes and weirdoes and dingbats and dodoes
And athletes and movie stars and David Allan Coe
Leather and lace and every minority race
With a backstage pass to the Willie Nelson show

I wish, you could've been there
But maybe you were

Johnny Cash,"Well I had a little feeling to have a big night
And I woke up feeling small and not so brave and not quite right
I had to face the where was I and who was she, what did I do
Worst of all I had to face the big light

The big light came through my window and it opened up my eyelids
And it snapped them up like roller blinds and it told me things that I did
I can't face another day and night of good ideas and complications
And I'm thankful that I didn't open another bottle of inspiration

When the hangover this morning had a personality
And I cast my shattered mind over selected memories
Didn't even touch the light switch 'cause I didn't want to see
That haggard face was staring back at me

The big light came through my window and it opened up my eyelids
And it snapped them up like roller blinds and it told me things that I did
I can't face another day and night of good ideas and complications
And I'm thankful that I didn't open another bottle of inspiration

Yes I had a little feeling to have a big time
And I woke up to alarm bells like a big church chime
I had to face the where was I and who was she, what did I do
Worst of all I had to face the big light

The big light came through my window and it opened up my eyelids
And it snapped them up like roller blinds and it told me things that I did
I can't face another day and night of good ideas and complications

It ain't nothin' but a hundred and seventy-five thousand pounds of steel
Could be the money babe, could be the power
Could be I love the way it feels

But you know she's mighty unforgivin' and you got to pay attention
'Cause the d-10 can be the death of you
But I get her all fired up and I can feel it in my soul
And it's hard to tell just who's drivin' who

I can move Alaska all the way to Beirut
I can bulldoze a beeline from here to Peru
I can push the rocky mountains into the sea
You know heavy metal don't mean rock and roll to me

I'm like a modern day mule skinner, drivin' ten thousand mules
So say a little prayer every day
Lord, just let me get her turned around without fallin' off this mountain

Just relax, take it easy.
You're still young, that's your fault,
There's so much you have to know.
Find a girl, settle down,
If you want you can marry.
Look at me, I am old, but I'm happy.

I was once like you are now
And I know that it's not easy,
To be calm when you've found
Something going on.
But take your time, think a lot,
Why, think of everything you've got.
For you will still be here tomorrow
But your dreams may not.

How can I try to explain
When I do he turns away again
It's always been the same, same old story.
From the moment I could talk I was ordered to listen.
Now there's a way and I know that I have to go away.

'Cause she turned and I was gone

I still might run in silence tears of joy might stain my face
And the summer sun might burn me till I'm blind
But not to where I cannot see
You walkin' on the back roads by the rivers flowin' gentle on my mind

Back from some gurglin', cracklin' cauldron in some train yard
My beard a roughenin' coal pile
And a dirty hat pulled low across my face

Johnny Cash,"Well, I left Kentucky back in '49
An' went to Detroit workin' on a 'sembly line
The first year they had me puttin' wheels on Cadillac's

Every day I'd watch them beauties roll by
And sometimes I'd hang my head and cry
'Cause I always wanted me one that was long and black.

One day I devised myself a plan
That should be the envy of most any man
I'd sneak it out of there in a lunchbox in my hand
Now gettin' caught meant gettin' fired
But I figured I'd have it all by the time I retired
I'd have me a car worth at least a hundred grand.

I'd get it one piece at a time
And it wouldn't cost me a dime
You'll know it's me when I come through your town
I'm gonna ride around in style
I'm gonna drive everybody wild
'Cause I'll have the only one there is a round.

So the very next day when I punched in
With my big lunchbox and with help from my friends
I left that day with a lunch box full of gears
Now, I never considered myself a thief
GM wouldn't miss just one little piece
Especially if I strung it out over several years.

The first day I got me a fuel pump
And the next day I got me an engine and a trunk
Then I got me a transmission and all of the chrome
The little things I could get in my big lunchbox
Like nuts, an' bolts, and all four shocks
But the big stuff we snuck out in my buddy's mobile home.

Now, up to now my plan went all right
'Til we tried to put it all together one night
And that's when we noticed that something was definitely wrong.

The transmission was a '53
And the motor turned out to be a '73
And when we tried to put in the bolts all the holes were gone.

So we drilled it out so that it would fit
And with a little bit of help with an A-daptor kit
We had that engine runnin' just like a song
Now the headlight' was another sight
We had two on the left and one on the right
But when we pulled out the switch all three of 'em come on.

The back end looked kinda funny too
But we put it together and when we got through
Well, that's when we noticed that we only had one tail-fin
About that time my wife walked out
And I could see in her eyes that she had her doubts
But she opened the door and said ""Honey, take me for a spin.""

So we drove up town just to get the tags
And I headed her right on down main drag
I could hear everybody laughin' for blocks around
But up there at the court house they didn't laugh
'Cause to type it up it took the whole staff
And when they got through the title weighed sixty pounds.

I got it one piece at a time
And it didn't cost me a dime
You'll know it's me when I come through your town
I'm gonna ride around in style
I'm gonna drive everybody wild
'Cause I'll have the only one there is around.

This is the cotton mouth
In the pyscho-billy Cadillac come on

And picked it up, it's cheaper that way

Johnny Cash,"An old cowboy went riding out one dark and windy day
Upon a ridge he rested as he went along his way
When all at once a mighty herd of red eyed cows he saw
A-plowing through the ragged sky and up the cloudy draw

Their brands were still on fire and their hooves were made of steel
Their horns were black and shiny and their hot breath he could feel
A bolt of fear went through him as they thundered through the sky
For he saw the Riders coming hard and he heard their mournful cry

Ghost Riders in the sky

Their faces gaunt, their eyes were blurred, their shirts all soaked with sweat
He's riding hard to catch that herd, but he ain't caught 'em yet
Cause they've got to ride forever on that range up in the sky
On horses snorting fire
As they ride on hear their cry

As the riders loped on by him he heard one call his name
If you want to save your soul from Hell a-riding on our range
Then cowboy change your ways today or with us you will ride
Trying to catch the Devil's herd, across these endless skies

Bendin' low at the peoples' feet
On the windy corner of the dirty street

How'd he keep from gettin' the blues
He grinned as he raised his little head
Popped a shoeshine rag and then he said.

It only costs a dime, just a nickel a shoe
Does a million dollars worth of good for you
Get rhythm when you get thee blues.

And I thought I was gonna jump for joy

Johnny Cash,"Sam Stone came home
To his wife and family
After serving in the conflict overseas

And the time that he served
Had shattered all his nerves
And left a little shrapnel in hs knee

But the morphine eased the pain
And the grass grew 'round his brain
And gave him all the confidence he lacked
With a Purple Heart and a monkey on his back

There's a hole in daddy's arm
Where all the money goes
Jesus Christ died for nothing I suppose

Little pitchers have big ears
Don't stop to count the years
Sweet songs never last too long
On broken radios

Sam Stone's welcome home
Didn't last too long
He went to work, he'd spent his last dime

And Sammy took to stealing
When he got that empty feeling
For a hundred dollar habit, without overtime

And the gold rolled through his veins
Like a thousand railroad trains
Eased his mind in the hours that he chose
While the kids ran around wearing other
People's clothes

There's a hole in daddy's arm
Where all the money goes
Jesus Christ died for nothing I suppose

Little pitchers have big ears
Don't stop to count the years
Sweet songs never last too long
On broken radios

Sam Stone was alone
When he popped his last balloon
Climbing walls while sitting in a chair

Well, he played his last request
While the room smelled just like death
With an overdose hovering in the air

But life had lost it's fun
And there was nothing to be done
Trade his house that he bought on the GI Bill
For a flag draped casket on a local heroes hill

There's a hole in daddy's arm
Where all the money goes
Jesus Christ died for nothing I suppose

Little pitchers have big ears
Don't stop to count the years
Sweet songs never last too long
On broken radios

Someone was killed, 'neath the town hall light
There were few at the scene, but they all agreed
That the slayer who ran, looked a lot like me

The judge said son, what is your alibi
If you were somewhere else, then you won't have to die
I spoke not a word, thou it meant my life
For I'd been in the arms of my best friend's wife

She walks these hills in a long black veil
She visits my grave when the night winds wail
Nobody knows, nobody sees
Nobody knows but me

Oh, the scaffold is high and eternity's near
She stood in the crowd and shed not a tear
But late at night, when the north wind blows
In a long black veil, she cries over my bones

To go and listen,

And they forgot him in the little town,

She blossoms in the spring but then she's gone in the fall

She tells me that she loves me but her heart's a little undergrown

Well she drifts around the country like a steamboat on a foam
She said she'd never leave me but she got the urge to roam
She never changes course she just goes along that same ol' way
Well I hope she keeps a driftin' rolls back home someday
Cause if I ever find her gonna chain her to the floor
And tell her now sit there woman you ain't leavin' no more

And harder to love than most men
But the blood that ran in these tired old hands
Was hotter and wilder back then

And I don't feel as tall as I used to

You're the one that held my hand when I fell
When I just couldn't make it alone

I sang all the old songs

I guess, you're the one

Your daughters a ladies, she's a fortune
My your son is an heir to the throne
And this crown that I hold is tarnished and cold
But it's a symbol of all that we own

Sometimes I wish I was younger
And could pick up the pieces and run
But then I look back on the matter of fact
And it's a race that we've already won

Four strong winds that blow lonely, seven seas that run high
All those things that don't change, come what may
But our good times are all gone, and I'm bound for moving on
I'll look for you if I'm ever back this way

Guess I'll go down to Alberta, weather's good there in the fall
Got some friends that I can go to workin' for
Still I wish you'd change your mind, if I asked you one more time
But we've been through that a hundred times or more

And it just made it worse when I laid them on somebody else
So I finally surrendered it all, brought down in despair
I cried out for help and I felt a warm comforter there

And I came to believe in a power much higher than I
I came to believe that I needed help to get by
In childlike faith I gave in and gave him a try
And I came to believe in a power much higher than I

Nothing worked out when I handled it all on my own
And each time I failed it made me feel twice as alone
Then I cried ""Lord there must be a surer and easier way
For it just cannot be that a man should lose hope everyday""

Once in a while along the way

There was a girl in Denver
Before the summer storm

Oh, her arms were warm
And she could smile away the thunder
Kiss away the rain

With no way to hold my head that didn't hurt 
And the beer I had for breakfast wasn't bad
So I had one more for dessert 
Then I fumbled in my closet through my clothes 
And found my cleanest dirty shirt 
Then I washed my face and combed my hair 
And stumbled down the stairs to meet the day 

I'd smoked my mind the night before 
With cigarettes and songs I'd been picking 
But I lit my first and watched a small kid 
Playing with a can that he was kicking 
Then I walked across the street 
And caught the Sunday smell of someone frying chicken 
And Lord, it took me back to something that I'd lost 
Somewhere, somehow along the way 

On a Sunday morning sidewalk
I'm wishing, Lord, that I was stoned 
'Cause there's something in a Sunday 
That makes a body feel alone 
And there's nothing short a' dying 
That's half as lonesome as the sound 
Of the sleeping city sidewalk 
And Sunday morning coming down 

In the park I saw a daddy 
With a laughing little girl that he was swinging 
And I stopped beside a Sunday school 
And listened to the songs they were singing 
Then I headed down the street
And somewhere far away a lonely bell was ringing
And it echoed through the canyon 
Like the disappearing dreams of yesterday 

On a Sunday morning sidewalk
I'm wishing, Lord, that I was stoned 
'Cause there's something in a Sunday 
That makes a body feel alone

He's the fairest of ten thousand to my soul
He's the Lily of the Valley, in Him alone I see
All I need to cleanse and make me fully whole

In sorrow He's my comfort, in trouble He's my stay
And He tells me every care on Him to roll
He's the lily of the valley, the bright and morning star
He's the fairest of ten thousand to my soul

He will never, never leave me nor yet forsake me here
While I live by faith and do His blessed will
There's a wall of fire about me and I've nothing now to fear
With His manna He my hungry soul shall fill

And then sweeping up to glory to see His blessed face
Where rivers of delight shall ever roll

He's the fairest of ten thousand to my soul

Raised him on the banks of a river bed
On a houseboat tied to a big tall tree

The clock strikes three and papa jumps to his feet
Already mama's cooking papa something to eat
At half past, papa he's ready to go
He jumps in his pirogue headed down the bayou

Well, they call mama Rita and my daddy Jack
Little baby brother on the floor that's Mack
Bren and Lin are the family twins
And big brother Ed's on the bayou fishing

On the river floats papa's great big boat
And that's how my papa goes into town
Takes him every bit of a night and a day
To even reach a place where the people stay

And I can hardly wait until tomorrow comes around
That's the day my papa takes his furs to town
Papa promised me that I could go
He'd even let me see a cowboy show

I saw the cowboys and Indians for the first time then
I told my pop I've gotta go again
Well, Papa said, ""Son we've got lines to run
We'll come back again but first there's work to be done""

When I was a little fellow on my mommie's knee

Who ruled Babylon and all its land. 
Around the city, he built a wall
And declared that Babylon would never fall. 
He had concubines and wives, 
He called his Babylon ""Paradise."" 
On his throne he drank and ate, 
But for Belshazzar it was gettin' late. 

For he was weighed in the balance and found wanting, 
His kingdom was divided, couldn't stand. 
He was weighed in the balance and found wanting, 
His houses were built upon the sand. 

Well, the people feasted and drank their wine
And praised the false gods of his time. 
All holy things they scorned and mocked, 
But suddenly all their mocking stopped. 
For on the wall, there appeared a hand, 
Nothin' else, there was no man. 
In blood the hand began to write, 
And Belshazzar couldn't hide his fright. 

For he was weighed in the balance and found wanting, 
His kingdom was divided, couldn't stand. 
He was weighed in the balance and found wanting, 
His houses were built upon the sand. 

Well, no one around could understand
What was written by the mystic hand. 
Belshazzar tried, but couldn't find
A man who could give him peace of mind. 
But Daniel, the prophet, a man of God, 
He saw the writing on the wall in blood. 
Belshazzar asked him what it said, 
And Daniel turned to the wall and read:

Mama called us together and mama tried to smile
She said you know the cotton crop hadn't been too good this year
There's not a lot of spending money and well at least we're all here

I hope you won't expect a lot of Christmas presents
Just be thankful that there is plenty to eat
That'll make things a little more pleasant
And us kids got to thinking how really blessed we were
At least we were all healthy and most of all we had her

Roy cut down a pine oak tree and we drug it home Jack and me
Daddy killed a squirrel and Louise made the bread
Reba decorated the tree with popcorn strings before we went to bed
Mama and daddy sacrificed because this Christmas was kind of lean
After all there was the babies Tom and Joanne
And babies need a few things

I whittled a whistle for my brother Jack
And though we disagreed now and then
When I gave Jack that whistle he knew I thought the world of him
Mama made the girl's dresses out of flower sacks
And when she ironed them down
You couldn't tell that they hadn't come from town

A sharecropper family across the road didn't have it as good as us
They didn't even have a light and it was way past dusk
And mama said, ""Well I bet they don't even have coal oil
Let alone apples and oranges and such""

Me and Jack took a jar of coal oil nd some hickernuts we'd found
We walked to the sharecropper's porch and set 'em down
A poor old ragged lady eased open the door
She picked up the coal oil and hickernuts and said
""I sure do thank you"" and quickly closed the door

We started back home me and Jack
And about halfway we stopped looked back
And in the sharecropper's window at last was a light
So for one of the neighbors and for us it was a good Christmas night

And paced the floor waiting for the thaw

Been out prospecting for two years or so
Pulled into Fairbanks, the city was a boon
So I took a little stroll to the Red Dog Saloon

When I walked in the door, the music was clear
Prettiest voice I had heard in two years
The song she kept singing would make a man's blood run cold
When it's springtime in Alaska, it's forty below

It was red headed Louie that was singing so sweet
I reached down and took the snow packs off of my feet
I reached for the gal that was singing the tune
We did the Eskimo hop all around the saloon

Where the caribou crawl and the grizzly bear hug
We did our dance on a Kodiak rug
The song she kept singing would make a man's blood run cold
When it's springtime in Alaska, it's forty below

Took Medgar Evers' blood
A finger fired the trigger to his name
A handle hid out in the dark
A hand set the spark
Two eyes took the aim
Behind a man's brain
But he can't be blamed
He's only a pawn in their game

A South politician preaches to the poor white man
""You got more than the blacks, don't complain
You're better than them, you been born with white skin,"" they explain
And the Negro's name
Is used, it is plain
For the politician's gain
As he rises to fame
And the poor white remains
On the caboose of the train
But it ain't him to blame
He's only a pawn in their game

The deputy sheriffs, the soldiers, the governors get paid
And the marshals and cops get the same
But the poor white man's used in the hands of them all like a tool
He's taught in his school
From the start by the rule
That the laws are with him
To protect his white skin
To keep up his hate
So he never thinks straight
'Bout the shape that he's in
But it ain't him to blame
He's only a pawn in their game

From the poverty shacks, he looks from the cracks to the tracks
And the hoofbeats pound in his brain
And he's taught how to walk in a pack
Shoot in the back
With his fist in a clinch
To hang and to lynch
To hide 'neath the hood
To kill with no pain
Like a dog on a chain
He ain't got no name
But it ain't him to blame
He's only a pawn in their game

Today, Medgar Evers was buried from the bullet he caught
They lowered him down as a king
But when the shadowy sun sets on the one

Johnny Cash,"She was called a scarlet woman by the people
Who would go to church but left me in the street
With no parents of my own,I never had a home
And an eighteen year old boy has got to eat
           
She found me outside one Sunday morning
Taking money from a man I didn't know
She took me in and wiped away my childhood
A woman of the streets this Lady Rose
           
[Chorus]
This bed of roses that I lay on
Where I was taught to be a man
This bed of roses where I'm living
Is the only kind of love I understand
           
She was a handsome woman just thirty-four
Who was spoken to in town by very few
She managed a late evening business
Like most of the town wished they could do
           
And I learned all the things that a man should know
From a woman not approved of I suppose
But she died knowing that I really loved her
Off life's bramble bush,I picked a rose",Bed of Roses [DVD],2008
Johnny Cash,"Hey little girl, with tears in your eyes
Don't waste your time now, askin' me why
I don't know, I know I'll just be movin' along
You'd say that home is where my love is at
I say that home is where I hang my hat
The time has come to sing a travelin' song

You own a house and a lot of close friends
I love the feel of my back to the wind
The two won't match, you know the caves so wild would be wrong
You want your friends and love, a child and a home
You can't buy love on a twenty year loan
The time has come to sing a travelin' song

Someday where we sat on that old porch swing
A tamer man might offer you a ring
A man that wants his friends and neighbors, a child and a home
Don't waste your tears on dreams that never can be
What's right for others is not right for me

Tryin' to make a livin' out of black-land dirt
But we'd get together in a family circle singin' loud

Me and little brother would join right in there
Singin' seems to help a troubled soul
One of these days and it won't be long
I'll rejoin them in a song

Though the circle won't be broken
By and by, Lord, by and by

Straight to the portals of never more die
Never more pain in them old aching bones
Wings in the morning to carry us home

My grandfather lived by the book all his life
On rich bottom land with twelve kids and a wife
He never saw TV, nor rode a jet plane
But he knew that heaven was holding his claim

The salt of the earth, yet with faith in the Lord
They all got together in that one accord
And what could be greater than God's guarantee
That we can have heaven for eternity?

Rocks in the road and we stumble and fall
Lights getting low, so we don't see at all
But I promise you, on that getting up day
Wings in the morning, we'll fly away

Johnny Cash,"I studied at the feet of a master
Gamaliel we called him, the beauty of the law
I was born of the Tribe of Benjamin, I was a Pharisee
And I could quote from memory the Holy Torah

That day that the Nazarene was brought to trial
It was on a Sabbath eve, there was a earthquake when He died
Just another passing preacher who came up from Galilee
Blaspheming trouble-maker, we let Him be crucified

Then I thought that I would hear no more about him
But his friends found his tomb empty
Claimed that he rose from the dead
Then they said he walked among them
With the nail wounds in his hands
That King upon a donkey with a thorn crown on his head

His followers kept growing in great number
And the one that they call Caiaphas mocked us in the judgment hall
And with the Greek name Stephen, we knew the gentiles had come in
I cast my vote against him, he was stoned I saw him fall

Then the friends of the Nazarene became united
And I became enraged then led a slaughter zealously
I found their secret places, they were beaten, they were chained
But some of them were scattered, justified in fearing me

Then the Man in White, appeared to me
In such a blinding light it struck me down
With it's brilliance, took away my sight, then the Man in White
In gentle loving tone spoke to me
And I was blinded so that I might see, the Man in White

But like the wind that blows the scattered sea
From Alexandria to Antioch their congregation grew
I went to the high priest for letters of permission
To go to other cities, to see my mission through

Six days on the hot road to the masters
And just outside the city in the middle of the day
A great unearthly light struck and overpowered me
Prostrate on the hot road, I was blinded were I laid

Then I thought I heard the rushing of great water
And a multitude of angels singing sweet and heavenly
And through the sound of wind, came a voice so soft and kind
Meant for only me to hear, ""Saul, why do you persecute me?""

As I lay there on the ground, in my blindness
He asked me once again, and suddenly the voice I knew
So finally I managed, a trembling response
Who are you Lord? I asked him, but I already knew

I am Jesus of Nazareth the voice answered
Arise go to Damascus on the street called Straight will be
A place where you will wait for my servant Ananias
He will open up your eyes, you'll be a witness unto me

So now I live to serve my master
As zealous in his service as I once was as his foe
And keeping his commandments given on Damascus road
I go to all the world, and I let the whole world know

Then the Man in White, appeared to me
In such a blinding light it struck me down
With it's brilliance, took away my sight, then the Man in White

And I was blinded so that I might see, the Man in White

He weighed two hundred and thirty-five pounds
But I saw that giant of a man brought down
To his knees by love

He was the kind of man that would gamble on luck

But I saw him crying like a little whipped pup
Because of love

They trouble their minds day in and day out
Too busy with livin' to worry about
A little word like love

But when I see a mother's tenderness
As she holds her young close to her breast
Then I think god that the world's been blessed
With a thing called love

You can't see it with your eyes, hold it in your hands
But like the wind it covers our land

Why you never see bright colors on my back,
And why does my appearance seem to have a somber tone.
Well, there's a reason for the things that I have on.

I wear the black for the poor and the beaten down,
Livin' in the hopeless, hungry side of town,
I wear it for the prisoner who has long paid for his crime,
But is there because he's a victim of the times.

I wear the black for those who never read,
Or listened to the words that Jesus said,
About the road to happiness through love and charity,
Why, you'd think He's talking straight to you and me.

Well, we're doin' mighty fine, I do suppose,
In our streak of lightnin' cars and fancy clothes,
But just so we're reminded of the ones who are held back,
Up front there ought 'a be a Man In Black.

I wear it for the sick and lonely old,
For the reckless ones whose bad trip left them cold,
I wear the black in mournin' for the lives that could have been,
Each week we lose a hundred fine young men.

And, I wear it for the thousands who have died,
Believen' that the Lord was on their side,
I wear it for another hundred thousand who have died,
Believen' that we all were on their side.

Well, there's things that never will be right I know,
And things need changin' everywhere you go,
But 'til we start to make a move to make a few things right,

Johnny Cash,"(Dream on, dream on teenage queen prettiest girl we've ever seen)
There's a story in our town
Of the prettiest girl around
Golden hair and eyes of blue
How those eyes could flash at you (How those eyes could flash at you)
Boys hung 'round her by the score
But she loved the boy next door who worked at the candy store
(Dream on, dream on teenage queen prettiest girl we've ever seen)

She was tops in all they said
It never once went to her head
She had everything it seems
Not a care, this teenage queen (Not a care, this teenage queen)
Other boys could offer more
But she loved the boy next door who worked at the candy store
(Dream on, dream on teenage queen you should be a movie queen)

He would marry her next spring
Saved his money, bought a ring
Then one day a movie scout
Came to town to take her out (Came to town to take her out)
Hollywood could offer more
So she left the boy next door working at the candy store
(Dream on, dream on teenage queen see you on the movie screen)

Very soon she was a star
Pretty house and shiny car
Swimming pool and a fence around
But she missed her old home town (But she missed her old home town)
All the world was at her door
All except the boy next door who worked at the candy store
(Dream on, dream on teenage queen saddest girl we've ever seen)

Then one day the teenage star
Sold her house and all her cars
Gave up all her wealth and fame
Left it all and caught a train (Left it all and caught a train)
Do I have to tell you more
She came back to the boy next door who worked at the candy store

Johnny Cash,"I close my eyes and picture the emerald of the sea;
From the fishing boats at Dingle to the shores of Dunadee.
I miss the River Shannon and the folks at Skipparee;
The moor lands and the meadows,
With their forty shades of green.

But most of all I miss a girl in Tipperary town,
And most of all I miss her lips as soft as eiderdown.
Again I want to see and do the things we've done and seen,
Where the breeze is sweet as Shalimar,
And there's forty shades of green.

I wish that I could spend an hour at Dublin's churning surf;
I'd love to watch the farmers drain the bogs and spade the turf.
To see again the thatching of the straw the women glean;
I'd walk from Cork to Lairn to see their forty shades of green.

But most of all I miss a girl in Tipperary town,
And most of all I miss her lips as soft as eiderdown.
Again I want to see and do the things we've done and seen,
Where the breeze is sweet as Shalimar,
And there's forty shades of green.",40 Shades of Green,2008
Johnny Cash,"Well my daddy left home when I was three
And he didn't leave much to Ma and me
Just this old guitar and an empty bottle of booze
Now, I don't blame him 'cause he run and hid
But the meanest thing that he ever did
Was before he left, he went and named me ""Sue""

Well, he must o' thought that is quite a joke
And it got a lot of laughs from a' lots of folk
It seems I had to fight my whole life through
Some gal would giggle and I'd get red
And some guy'd laugh and I'd bust his head
I tell ya, life ain't easy for a boy named ""Sue""

Well, I grew up quick and I grew up mean
My fist got hard and my wits got keen
Roam from town to town to hide my shame
But I made me a vow to the moon and stars
I'd search the honky-tonks and bars
And kill that man who gave me that awful name

Well, it was Gatlinburg in mid-July
And I just hit town and my throat was dry
I thought I'd stop and have myself a brew
At an old saloon on a street of mud
There at a table, dealing stud
Sat the dirty, mangy dog that named me ""Sue""

Well, I knew that snake was my own sweet dad
From a worn-out picture that my mother'd had
And I knew that scar on his cheek and his evil eye
He was big and bent and gray and old
And I looked at him and my blood ran cold
And I said: ""My name is 'Sue!' How do you do!?
Now you gonna die!""
Yeah that's what I told 'em

Well, I hit him hard right between the eyes
And he went down, but to my surprise
He come up with a knife and cut off a piece of my ear
But I busted a chair right across his teeth
And we crashed through the wall and into the street
Kicking and a' gouging in the mud and the blood and the beer

I tell ya, I've fought tougher men
But I really can't remember when
He kicked like a mule and he bit like a crocodile
I heard him laugh and then I heard him cuss
He went for his gun and I pulled mine first
He stood there lookin' at me and I saw him smile

And he said, ""Son, this world is rough
And if a man's gonna make it, he's gotta be tough
And I know I wouldn't be there to help ya along
So I give ya that name and I said goodbye
I knew you'd have to get tough or die
And it's the name that helped to make you strong""

Yeah he said, ""Now you just fought one hell of a fight
And I know you hate me, and you got the right
To kill me now, and I wouldn't blame you if you do
But ya ought to thank me, before I die
For the gravel in ya guts and the spit in ya eye
'Cause I'm the son-of-a-bitch that named you ""Sue""
Yeah what could I do, what could I do

I got all choked up and I threw down my gun
Called him my Pa, and he called me his son
And I come away with a different point of view
And I think about him, now and then
Every time I try and every time I win
And if I ever have a son, I think I'm gonna name him
Bill or George! Anything but Sue! I still hate that name! Yeah",A Boy Named Sue [Live] [Live],2008
Johnny Cash,"We were just a plain ol' hillbilly band with a plain ol' country style
We never played the kind of songs that'd drive anybody wild
Played a railroad song with a stomping beat
We played a blues song, kinda slow and sweet
But the thing that knocked them off of their feet was, ooh-wee

When Luther played the boogie woogie, Luther played the boogie woogie
Luther played the boogie woogie, Luther played the boogie woogie
Luther played the boogie woogie, Luther played the boogie woogie
Luther played the boogie woogie, Luther played the boogie in the strangest kind of way

Play it strange

Well, we did our best to entertain everywhere we'd go
We'd nearly wear our fingers off to give the folks a show
Played jumping jive to make 'em get in the groove
We played sad songs, real slow and smooth
But the only thing that'd make 'em move was, ooh-wee

When Luther played the boogie woogie, Luther played the boogie woogie
Luther played the boogie woogie, Luther played the boogie woogie
Luther played the boogie woogie, Luther played the boogie woogie
Luther played the boogie woogie, Luther played the boogie in the strangest kind of way
Now damn Luther play the boogie straight",Luther's Boogie,2008
Johnny Cash,"You're gonna break another heart
You're gonna tell another lie

Well, here I am and there you go, you're gone again
I know you're gonna be the way you've always been

Breaking hearts and telling lies is all you know
Another guy gives you the eye
There you go

You're gone again

I couldn't win 

There you go

I see bad times today

Don't go around tonight
Well, it's bound to take your life
There's a bad moon on the rise

I hear hurricanes ablowin'
I know the end is comin' soon
I fear rivers overflowin'
I hear the voice of rage and ruin

Don't go around tonight
Well, it's bound to take your life

Hope you got your things together
Hope you are quite prepared to die

Johnny Cash,"I have seen the morning burning golden on the mountain in the skies
Achin' with the feelin' of the freedom of an eagle when she flies
Turnin' on the world the way she smiled upon my soul as I lay dying
Healin' as the colors in the sunshine and the shadows of her eyes

Wakin' in the mornin' to the feelin' of her fingers on my skin
Wipin' out the traces of the people and the places that I've been
Teachin' me that yesterday was something that I never thought of trying
Talkin' of tomorrow and the money, love and time we had to spend

Lovin' her was easier than anything I'll ever do again

Comin' close together with a feelin' that I've never known before in my time
She ain't ashamed to be a woman or afraid to be a friend
I don't know the answer to the easy way she opened every door in my mind
But dreamin' was as easy as believin' it was never gonna end

And lovin' her was easier than anything I'll ever do again

Oh, oh, aah",Loving Her Was Easier (Than Anything I'll Ever Do Again),2008
Johnny Cash,"Sometimes its hard to be a woman
Givin´ all your love to just one man
You´ll have bad times
And he´ll have good times
Doin´ things that you don´t understand

But if you love him you´ll forgive him
Even though he´s hard to understand
And if you love him
Oh, be proud of him
´Cause, after all, he´s just a man

Stand by your man
Give him two arms to cling to
And something warm to come to
When nights are cold and lonely

Stand by your man
And show the world you love him
Keep givin´ all the love you can
Stand by your man [Repeat: x 2]",Stand by Your Man,2008
Johnny Cash,"There is a young cowboy he lives on the range
His horse and his cattle are his only companions
He works in the saddle and he sleeps in the canyons
Waiting for summer, his pastures to change

And as the moon rises he sits by his fire
Thinking about women and glasses of beer
And closing his eyes as the doggies retire
He sings out a song which is soft but it's clear
As if maybe someone could hear

[Chorus:]
Goodnight you moonlight ladies
Rockabye sweet baby James
Deep greens and blues are the colors I choose
Won't you let me go down in my dreams
And rockabye sweet baby James

Now the first of December was covered with snow
And so was the turnpike from Stockbridge to Boston
Lord, the Berkshires seemed dream-like on account of that frosting
With ten miles behind me and ten thousand more to go

There's a song that they sing when they take to the highway
A song that they sing when they take to the sea
A song that they sing of their home in the sky
Maybe you can believe it if it helps you to sleep
But singing works just fine for me

[Chorus:]",Sweet Baby James,2008
Johnny Cash,"Just yesterday mornin', they let me know you were gone
Suzanne the plans they made put an end to you
I walked out this morning and I wrote down this song
I just can't remember who to send it to
 
I've seen fire and I've seen rain
I've seen sunny days that I thought would never end
I've seen lonely times when I could not find a friend
But I always thought that I'd see you again
 
Won't you look down upon me, Jesus 
You've got to help me make a stand
You've just got to see me through another day
My body's aching and my time is at hand
I won't make it any other way
 
I've seen fire and I've seen rain
I've seen sunny days that I thought would never end
I've seen lonely times when I could not find a friend
But I always thought that I'd see you again
 
Been walking my mind to an easy time, my back turned towards the sun
Lord knows when the cold wind blows, it'll turn your head around
Well there's hours of time on the telephone line to talk about things to come
Sweet dreams and flying machines in pieces on the ground
 
I've seen fire and I've seen rain
I've seen sunny days that I thought would never end
I've seen lonely times when I could not find a friend
But I always thought that I'd see you baby, one more time again, now

Thought I'd see you one more time again
There's just a few things coming my way this time around now

Johnny Cash,"(Praises sing to Christ the King and peace to men on earth) 
On Christmas Eve I dreamed I traveled all around the earth 
And in my dream I saw and heard the ways the different people hail the king 
Whose star shone in the east and what a dream it was 
In London Town I walked around Piccadilly Circus 
A mass of people movin' here and there I wandered where 
On every face at every place was hurry up I'm late 
But a kind old man at a chestnut stand said merry Christmas mate 
And I felt the Christmas spirit 

In a little town nestled down in Bavaria Germany 
I walked along to see what the feeling there would be 
And here again was the busy din the rushin' the yellin' 
But some kind boy said Frohliche Weihnachten 
Not undesratnding the words but gettin' the buyin' and sellin' 
I felt the Christmas spirit 

In Bethlehem I heard a hymn some distant choir sang 
And with other tourists I walked along to a church as its bells rang 
Then I heard someone tell someone there's where Christ was born 
I wonder if he looked like our baby looked on that first morn 
And then I really felt the Christmas spirit 
From a businessman in the Holy Land as a sidewalk souvenirshop 
I bought a little Bible since I'd hardly stopped 
And it was in Paris France somehow by chance that I took the Bible out 
And as I flipped the pages I saw these words and I knew what it was all about 
For I read fear not for behold I bring you good tidings of great joy 
Which shall be to all people 
For unto you he was born this day in the City of David a Saviour 
Which is Christ the Lord 

Then I took the little Holy Book held it close and tight 
I closed my eyes and visualized the glory of that night 
So suddenly it came to me for when I awoke on Christmas Day 
I felt the Christmas spirit down deep inside to stay 
(O little town of Bethlehem how still we see Thee lie 
Above Thy deep and dreamless sleep the silent stars go by 
Yet in Thy dark streets shineth the everlasting light 
The hopes and fears of all the years are met in Thee tonight)",The Christmas Spirit [DVD],2009
Johnny Cash,"I heard the bells on Christmas Day
Their old familiar carols play
And wild and sweet the words repeat
Of peace on earth goodwill to men

I thought how as the day had come
The belfries of all Christendom
Had rolled along unbroken song
Of peace on earth goodwill to men

And in despair I bowed my head
There is no peace on earth I said
For hate is strong that mocks the song
Of peace on earth goodwill to men

Then pealed the bells more loud and deep
God is not dead nor doubt He sleeps
The wrong shall fail the right prevail
With peace on earth goodwill to men

Till ringin' singin' on its way
The world revolve from night to day
A voice a chime a chance so blind
Of peace on earth goodwill to men

How'd he keep from gettin' the blues
He grinned as he raised his little head
Popped a shoeshine rag and then he said.

Does a million dollars worth of good for you
Get rhythm when you get thee blues.

And I thought I was gonna jump for joy
Slapped on the shoe polish left and right

Mem'ries so sweet that I cry
Dreams that I've had left me feeling so bad

And it seems there's no good way to choose
Come along with me, misery loves company

Why you never see bright colors on my back

Makes some people go insane
While others quietly pray for rain
That's where we came from

Two boys playing in the burning sun
One with books, one with guns
Mama calls but just one comes
The other one runs

In a crystal sense of wrong and right
We were born and raised in black and white
One learned to pray, one loved to fight
We were born and raised in black and white
We were born and raised in black and white

Brother took to the gospel road
Spent his whole live saving souls
When he looked at me his blood ran cold
He didn't even try

I had no dreams, I had no plans
But a gun felt good in my right hand
The warden asked, “How come you killed that man”
I said, “I don't know why”

Welcome home said the hot moonlight
We were born and raised in black and white
One lives to pray, one prays for life
We were born and raised in black and white
We were born and raised in black and white

Someone handed me a cigarette
They offered me my last request
I asked my mortal soul be blessed
By someone close to me

He came to me with trembling hands
He swore he'd never understand
I said it's just what life had planned
It's destiny

Don't waste your tears on me tonight
We were born and raised in black and white
I chose the dark, you chased the light

And keep it on the yellow line, it'll take you to the big highway

Left my gal an' left my home
I heard that lonesome whistle blow

I went and broke my darling's heart

Locked me to a ball and chain
I heard that lonesome whistle blow

All alone, I bear the shame
I'm a number, not a name
I heard that lonesome whistle blow

All I do is sit an' cry
When the evening train goes by

Upon a ridge he rested as he went along his way
When all at once a mighty herd of red eyed cows he saw
A-plowing through the ragged sky and up the cloudy draw

Their brands were still on fire and their hooves were made of steel
Their horns were black and shiny and their hot breath he could feel
A bolt of fear went through him as they thundered through the sky
For he saw the riders coming hard and he heard their mournful cry

Yippie yi ooh
Yippie yi yay
Ghost riders in the sky

Their faces gaunt, their eyes were blurred, their shirts all soaked with sweat
He's riding hard to catch that herd, but he ain't caught 'em yet
'Cause they've got to ride forever on that range up in the sky
On horses snorting fire
As they ride on hear their cry

As the riders loped on by him he heard one call his name

Then cowboy change your ways today or with us you will ride

Well my daddy left home when I was three
Didn't leave much to my mom and me
Except this old guitar and an empty bottle of booze
Now, I don't blame him 'cause he run and hid
But the meanest thing that my daddy ever did
Was before he left, he went and named me Sue

He must've thought that it was quite a joke
And I got a lot of laughs from a' lots of folk
Seems I had to fight my whole life through
Some gal would giggle and I'd turn red
And some guy'd laugh and I'd bust his head
I tell ya, life ain't easy for a boy named Sue

Well, I grew up quick and I grew up mean
My fist got hard and my wits got keener
Roam from town to town to hide my shame
But I made me a vow to the moon and stars
I'd search the honky tonks and bars
And kill that man that gave me that awful name

Well, it was Gatlinburg in mid-July
And I just hit town and my throat was dry
Thought I'd stop and have myself a brew
At an old saloon on a street of mud
There at a table, dealing stud
Sat the dirty, mangy dog that named me Sue

Well, I knew that snake was my own sweet dad
From a worn-out picture that my mother'd had
Knew that scar on his cheek and his evil eye
He was big and bent and gray and old
And I looked at him and my blood ran col
And I said, ""my name is Sue, how do you do?
Now you gonna die""

Well, I hit him hard right between the eyes
And he went down, but to my surprise
He come up with a knife and cut off a piece of my ear
Then I busted a chair right across his teeth
And we crashed through the walls and into the street
Kicking and a' gouging in the mud and the blood and the beer

Well I tell ya, I've fought tougher men
But I really can't remember when
He kicked like a mule and he bit like a crocodile
I heard him laugh and then I heard him cuss
And he reached for his gun but I pulled mine first
He stood there lookin' at me and I saw him smile

And he said, ""son, this world is rough
And if a man's gonna make it, he's gotta be tough
And I knew I wouldn't be there to help you along
So I give ya that name and I said goodbye
And I knew you'd have to get tough or die
It's that name that helped to make you strong""

He said, ""now you just fought one heck of a fight
And I know you hate me, and you got the right
To kill me now, and I wouldn't blame you if you do
But y ought to thank me, before I die
For the gravel in ya gut and the spit in ya eye
'Cause I'm the, that named you Sue""

What could I do?  
I got all choked up and I threw down my gun
I called him my pa, and he called me his son
Come away with a different point of view
And I think about him, now and then

I took a shot of cocaine and shot my woman down
I went right home and I went to bed
I stuck that lovin' forty-four beneath my head.

Got up next mornin' and I grabbed that gun
Took a shot of cocaine and away I run
Made a good run but I run too slow
They overtook me down in Juarez Mexico.

Laid in the hot joint takin' the pill
In walked a sheriff from Jericho Hill
He said Willy Lee your name is not Jack Brown
You're the dirty hack that shot your woman down.

I said yes sir my name is Willie Lee
If you've got a warrant just read it to me
Shot her down cause she made me slow
I thought I was her daddy but she had five more.

When I was arrested I was dressed in black
They put me on a train and they took me back
I had no friends for to go my bail
They slapped my dried up carcass in the county jail.

Got up next morning about a half past nine
I spied a sheriff comin' down the line
Coughed and coughed as he cleared his throat
He said come on you dirty hack into that district court

Into the court room my trial began
Where I was handled by twelve honest men
Just before the jury started out
I saw that little judge commence to look about.

In about five minutes in walked a man
Holding the verdict in his right hand
The verdict read in the first degree
I hollered Lordy Lordy have mercy on me

The judge he smiled as he picked up his pen
Ninety nine years in the Folsom pen
Ninety nine years underneath that ground

And made to make license plates

Johnny Cash,"I am a shotgun rider,
For the San Jacinto line,
The desert is my brother,
My skin is cracked and dry
I was ridin' on a folk coach
And everything was fine,
'Till we took a shorter road
To save some time
The bandits only fired once,
They shot me in the chest
They may have wounded me but,
They'll never get the best
Of better men
'Cause I'll ride again

I am a river gambler,
I make a livin' dealin' cards
My clothes are smooth and honest,
My heart is cold and hard
I was shufflin' for some delta boys,
On a boat for New Orleans,
I was the greatest shark they'd ever seen
But the captain bumped a sandbar,
And an ace fell from my sleeve
They threw me overboard,
As I swore I didn't cheat
But I could swim
And I'll ride again

We are heroes of the homeland, American remains
We live in many faces and answer many names
We will not be forgotten, we won't be left behind
Our memories live on in mortal minds
And poets pens
We'll ride again

I am a mid-west farmer,
I make a livin' off the land,
I ride a John Deere tractor,
I'm a liberated man
But the rain it hasn't fallen,
Since the middle of July,
And if it don't come soon my crops will die
The bank man says he likes me,
But there's nothin' he can do
He tells me that he's comin',
But the clouds are comin' too
He ain't my friend
And I'll ride again

I am an American Indian,
My tribe is Cherokee
My forefathers loved this land
They left it here for me
But the white man came with boats,
And trains and dirty factories,
An' poisoned my existence with his deeds
Nature is our mother,
We are suckling at her breast
And he who tries to beat her down,
Will lose her to the rest
They'll never win
I'll ride again

He rides off in a cloud of dust

The way it looks I'll probably hang cause there ain't no hope on a chain gang 
I dig that ditch I chop that corn I curse the day that I was born 
I believe it's better for a man to hang than to work like a dog on a chain gang 

The guard stands there with a great big gun I bet he'd love to see me run 
And I guess I probably will some day I'd rather be dead than to live this way 
He's well fed and he's six foot tall and he's a meanest of them all 
He cracks that whip and he swings that cane the sun must've touched his brain 
I dig that ditch

I try to make believe there's nothing wrong
But they're always asking me about you darling
And it hurts me so to tell 'em that you're gone
If they ask me I guess I'd be denyin' 
That I've been unhappy all alone
But if they heard my heart they'd hear it cryin'
Where's my darling, when's she coming home

I ask myself a million times what's right for me to do
To try to lose my blues alone or hang around for you
But I make it pretty good until that moon comes shining through
And then I get so doggone lonesome

Time stands still when you're a waitin' 
Sometimes I think my heart is stoppin' too
One lonely hour seems forever 
Sixty minutes more to wait for you
But I guess I'll keep waitin' 'til you're with me
'Cause I believe that loving you is right
But I don't care if the sun don't rise tomorrow 
If I can't have you with me tonight

Well I know I'll keep on loving you 
'Cause true love can't be killed

Which side do you need?

With an engineer that's brave
We must make the run successful
From the cradle to the grave

Heed the curves and watch the tunnels
Never falter, never fail
Keep your hand upon the throttle
And your eye upon the rail

Blessed Savior, Thou will guide us
Till we reach that blissful shore
Where the angels wait to join us
In that train forevermore

I got a blue-eyed girl

And there's a tire that swings in the air

There's a church I can't seem to find
On Sunday mornin'
But I sure found the place that I belong in

And big green beans

By chopping wood, the next one or five

Make some home made apple pie

And yet I seem to feel you near tonight

That you've made my freedom so complete 
That I'm no slave to whistle, clock or bell

And give me work that's open to the sky 
Make me a partner of the wind and sun

Let me be easy on the man that's down 
Let me be square and generous with all

Make me as big and open as the plains 
And honest as the horse between my knees 
Clean as a wind that blows behind the rains 
Free as the hawk that circles down the breeze 

Forgive me, Lord, if sometimes I forget 
You know about the reasons that are hid 
You understand the things that gall or fret 
Well, you knew me better than my mother did 
Just keep an eye on all that's done or said 
And right me sometimes when I turn aside 
And guide me on that long, dim trail ahead 
That stretches upward toward the great divide

Upon a ridge he rested as
He went along his way

Of red-eyed cows he saw
A plowing through the ragged skies
And up a cloudy drawl

Their brands were still on fire and
Their hooves were made of steel
Their horns were black and shiny and
Their hot breath he could feel
A bolt of fear went through him as
They thundered through the sky
For he saw the riders coming hard
And he heard their mournful cry

Their shirts all soaked with sweat

Because they've got to ride forever on
That range up in the sky
On horses snorting fire
As they ride on, hear their cry

As the riders loped on by him
As he heard one call his name

From riding on our range
Then cowboy change your ways today
Or with us you will ride

Who ruled Babylon and all its land. 
Around the city, he built a wall
And declared that Babylon would never fall. 
He had concubines and wives, 
He called his Babylon ""Paradise."" 
On his throne he drank and ate, 
But for Belshazzar it was gettin' late. 

For he was weighed in the balance and found wanting, 
His kingdom was divided, couldn't stand. 
He was weighed in the balance and found wanting, 
His houses were built upon the sand. 

Well, the people feasted and drank their wine
And praised the false gods of his time. 
All holy things they scorned and mocked, 
But suddenly all their mocking stopped. 
For on the wall, there appeared a hand, 
Nothin' else, there was no man. 
In blood the hand began to write, 
And Belshazzar couldn't hide his fright. 

For he was weighed in the balance and found wanting, 
His kingdom was divided, couldn't stand. 
He was weighed in the balance and found wanting,

Well, no one around could understand
What was written by the mystic hand. 
Belshazzar tried, but couldn't find
A man who could give him peace of mind. 
But Daniel, the prophet, a man of God, 
He saw the writing on the wall in blood. 
Belshazzar asked him what it said, 
And Daniel turned to the wall and read:

And so I searched the town but you had done pulled out
I looked north, east and west and then a leadin' south
I saw a wide open road

there's a wide open road
It?s leadin? south from my abode
If you stick around and turn your damper down
There's a wide open road

Well, the reason I was lookin? for you all over town
Was to tell you that your kitty cat is still around
And you left your weddin' ring when you went
Down that wide open road

If you gonna stay away then honey let me know
How to cook hot biscuits, how to roll a dough

Johnny Cash & the Tennessee Three,"Well, I left Kentucky back in '49
An' went to Detroit workin' on a 'sembly line
The first year they had me puttin' wheels on Cadillac's

Every day I'd watch them beauties roll by
And sometimes I'd hang my head and cry
'Cause I always wanted me one that was long and black.

One day I devised myself a plan
That should be the envy of most any man
I'd sneak it out of there in a lunchbox in my hand
Now gettin' caught meant gettin' fired
But I figured I'd have it all by the time I retired
I'd have me a car worth at least a hundred grand.

I'd get it one piece at a time
And it wouldn't cost me a dime
You'll know it's me when I come through your town
I'm gonna ride around in style
I'm gonna drive everybody wild
'Cause I'll have the only one there is a round.

So the very next day when I punched in
With my big lunchbox and with help from my friends
I left that day with a lunch box full of gears
Now, I never considered myself a thief
GM wouldn't miss just one little piece
Especially if I strung it out over several years.

The first day I got me a fuel pump
And the next day I got me an engine and a trunk
Then I got me a transmission and all of the chrome
The little things I could get in my big lunchbox
Like nuts, an' bolts, and all four shocks
But the big stuff we snuck out in my buddy's mobile home.

Now, up to now my plan went all right
'Til we tried to put it all together one night
And that's when we noticed that something was definitely wrong.

The transmission was a '53
And the motor turned out to be a '73
And when we tried to put in the bolts all the holes were gone.

So we drilled it out so that it would fit
And with a little bit of help with an A-daptor kit
We had that engine runnin' just like a song
Now the headlight' was another sight
We had two on the left and one on the right
But when we pulled out the switch all three of 'em come on.

The back end looked kinda funny too
But we put it together and when we got through
Well, that's when we noticed that we only had one tail-fin
About that time my wife walked out
And I could see in her eyes that she had her doubts
But she opened the door and said ""Honey, take me for a spin.""

So we drove up town just to get the tags
And I headed her right on down main drag
I could hear everybody laughin' for blocks around
But up there at the court house they didn't laugh
'Cause to type it up it took the whole staff
And when they got through the title weighed sixty pounds.

I got it one piece at a time
And it didn't cost me a dime
You'll know it's me when I come through your town
I'm gonna ride around in style
I'm gonna drive everybody wild
'Cause I'll have the only one there is around.

Ugh! Yow, red ryder
This is the cotton mouth
In the pyscho-billy Cadillac come on

Huh, This is the cotton mouth
And negatory on the cost of this mow-chine there red ryder
You might say I went right up to the factory
And picked it up, it's cheaper that way
Ugh!, what model is it?

Well, It's a '49, '50, '51, '52, '53, '54, '55, '56

Johnny Cash & the Tennessee Two,"A young cowboy named Billy Joe grew restless on the farm
A boy filled with wonderlust who really meant no harm
He changed his clothes and shined his boots
And combed his dark hair down
And his mother cried as he walked out

Don't take your guns to town son
Leave your guns at home Bill
Don't take your guns to town

He laughed and kissed his mom
And said your Billy Joe's a man
I can shoot as quick and straight as anybody can
But I wouldn't shoot without a cause
I'd gun nobody down
But she cried again as he rode away

Don't take your guns to town son
Leave your guns at home Bill
Don't take your guns to town

He sang a song as on he rode
His guns hung at his hips
He rode into a cattle town
A smile upon his lips
He stopped and walked into a bar
And laid his money down
But his mother's words echoed again

Don't take your guns to town son
Leave your guns at home Bill
Don't take your guns to town

He drank his first strong liquor then to calm his shaking hand
And tried to tell himself he had at last he had become a man
A dusty cowpoke at his side began to laugh him down
And he heard again his mothers words

Don't take your guns to town son
Leave your guns at home Bill
Don't take your guns to town

Filled with rage then
Billy Joe reached for his gun to draw
But the stranger drew his gun and fired
Before he even saw
As Billy Joe fell to the floor
The crowd all gathered 'round
And wondered at his final words

Don't take your guns to town son
Leave your guns at home Bill
Don't take your guns to town",Don't Take Your Guns to Town,2015
Johnny Cash & the Tennessee Two,"There are some people who say we cannot tell
Whether we are saved or whether all is well
They say we only can hope and trust that it is so
Well, I was there when it happened and so I guess I ought to know

Yes, I know when Jesus saved me (saved my soul)
The very moment He forgave me (made me whole)
He took away my heavy burdens
Lord, He gave me peace within (peace within)

Satan can't make me doubt it (I won't doubt it)
It's real and I'm gonna shout it (I'm gonna shout it)

And so I guess I ought to know

Of people in death machines

And he hated being in between oh

He's tired of the truth

He's tired of the fight
He's tired of the truce

That rolls on the sea of time
That can touch every single human soul
If they could recognize it when it came Too late

It's an illusion!

Once again my wings on fire
Flapping round your deadly flames
Walking on the old high wire
Trying to keep myself away
You come walking down your marble stairs
Throwing back your yellow hair
And I want you and I need you
But every time you let me near
You leave me feeling such sweet despair
Going to keep away, keep away

It's an illusion
To think I can keep away from you
It's an illusion
Like eskimoes in Mogadishu
It's an illusion
This state of independence I'm in
It's an illusion
Like polar bears in Berlin

You always go out when I want to sleep
Fire, water, sun and rain
War and peace and night and day
Who can understand
Love's magic incompatibilities?
Going to keep away, keep away

It's an illusion
It's just a cheap masquerade
It's an illusion
Hiding this love I can't evade
It's an illusion
Can't you see through the camouflage?
It's an illusion
Without you life is a mirage

I'm a foot without a shoe, I'm the fuzz without a clue
I'm a ship without a crew, I'm lost without you
One and one that can't make two, carrots looking for some stew
A lawyer with no one to sue, I'm lost without you
I'm the sky that's lost it's blue, I'm the beer that just won't brew
I'm a stamp that has no glue, I'm lost without you

Dream if you will but remember there are iron laws
However much you seek to solve this mystery
No one ignores the iron vice of history

They tried to fly over the palisades

Standing at the gates
This is Jericho
And the walls reach up to the stars
And outside we were singing psalms
Such a strange, strange place
For we are the prisoners
Of the prisoners we have taken
And the prophets' dreams are now forsaken

Sing me the songs of a world that I once knew
Recall the legends once so proud and true
My people used to live here not so long ago
But they fled into the night and I was left alone
I guard these walls for you and me
Dream on, sail on my memory

Standing at the gates

You, you had come to set them free

You are the rolling ocean
You are the mighty sea
You are the breath that brings each new day to me
You are what you are, you are
You be what you are, you be what you are

Women of salt and earth
They tell the same story
They saw you walking wounded
Wearing rags of glory
And when you rejoiced they saw you smiling at your rejoicing
When you wept they saw you smiling at your weeping
When you smiled they saw you smiling at your smiling
And you said that's the way I've survived these years of dust and
Blood.

You are the rolling ocean
You are the mighty sea
You are the breath that brings each new day to me
You are what you are, you are
You be what you are, you be what you are

Suffer little children
Suffer sister, brother too
Suffer mother, father
That's all the world can promise you
In our hearts we feel it
A mighty dream is coming true
Hold on and we'll dream it
Keep it up we're going to push it through
Don't give it up, don't give it up",Rolling Ocean,1989
Johnny Clegg,"Amambuka, amambuka azothengisa izwe lakithi, izwe lakithi

He was taken in the night
They came without any warning
No time to hide or fight
They came like bees aswarming
The questions start to fly
Will he break or will he defy?
Can he withstand the worst that is to come?
A child in a man's clothing
Resisting the fascist' ploy
The underground puts iron in the heart of any boy
Swimming in a sea of pain, he knows this is the end
He hears himself whisper the name of his best friend

I never betrayed you, and I never betrayed the revolution
I just didn't want to die alone, I needed you to see me home
And if I could save you, and if I could find a solution
I would die a thousand times, to get you out of here

Sharing the same cold cell
Betrayer and betrayed
An island with two frightened castaways
Not a word is spoken,
How can he explain?
Through swollen eyes they watch the dawn's first rays
It's all over now
They stand backs to the wall
Waiting for the fascist's sword to fall
In the desperation of a young life about to end
He turns before the bullet
And forgives a friend

I never betrayed you, and I never betrayed the revolution
I just didn't want to die alone, I needed you to see me home
And if I could save you, and if I could find a solution
I would die a thousand times, to get you out of here",Warsaw 1943,1989
Johnny Clegg,"Here we stand on the edge of the day
Faces melting in the african rain
So many seasons of silent war
So many drowned before they reached the shore
Nothing is clear to me any more in this sad and strange landscape
I've got no defense, I've got no attack
I can't leave, I can't stay and I've got no way back
Hard to deal with the way things have been
I can't lie but the truth is so extreme

Woman be my country, 'till my country can be mine
Hide me deep inside your borders in these dark and troubled times
Remember me my innocence before I drowned in the sea of lies
Woman be my country, 'till my country can be mine

Too many seasons of quiet rage
Too many young people just wasted away
Too many futures hanging in the balance
Too much owing nothing left to pay
A lonely flag flutters in the breeze
For the hardened hearts who still want to believe
Am I the witness or am I the crime
A victim of history or just a sign of the times
Across my heart questions and shadows still fly
But in the dead of the night I know where the answer lies

Woman be my country, 'till my country can be mine
I have no flag, I sing no anthem, I no longer carry an armalite
Bathe me in you sweet rivers, anoint me with your touch and your smile
To your colours I give my allegiance, I lay it on the line

Ngikhathele ngifile wena weqat' izwe
Ngikhathele ngifile zindaba zakho
Yash' imizi yobada

Woman be my country, 'till my country can be mine
Hide me deep inside your borders in these dark and troubled times
Remember me my innocence before I drowned in the sea of lies
Woman be my country, 'till my country can be mine",Woman Be My Country,1989
