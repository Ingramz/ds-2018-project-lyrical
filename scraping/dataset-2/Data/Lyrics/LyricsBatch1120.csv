Beth Luscombe,"Honey dear, want you near,
Just turn out the lights and then come over here!
Nestle close, up to my side,
My heart's afire, with love's desire
In my arms, rest complete,
Never thought that life could ever be so sweet
'Til I met you,some time ago,
But now you know,
I love you so!

Oh, you beautiful doll!
You great, big, beautiful doll!
Let me put my arms about you,
I could never live without you.

Oh, you beautiful doll!
You great, big, beautiful doll!
If you ever leave me how my heart would ache,
I want to hug you but I fear you'd break
Oh, oh, oh, oh,
Oh, you beautiful doll!

Precious prize, close your eyes,
Now we're goin' to visit lover's paradise,
Press your lips,
Again to mine,
For love is king of ev'rything
Squeeze me dear, I don't care!

Hug me just as if you were a grizzly bear
This is how I'll go through life,
No care or strife, when you're my wife
Oh, you beautiful doll!
You great, big, beautiful doll!
Let me put my arms about you,
I could never live without you.

Oh, you beautiful doll!
You great, big, beautiful doll!
If you ever leave me how my heart would ache,
I want to hug you but I fear you'd break
Oh, you beautiful doll! Oh, oh, oh, oh","Oh, You Beautiful Doll",1997
Beth McDonald,"Love is funny or it's sad, 
Or it's quiet or it's mad,
It's a good thing or it's bad,
But beautiful!

Beautiful to take a chance
And if you fall, you fall,
And I'm thinking I wouldn't mind at all.
Love is tearful or it's gay.
It's a problem or it's play,
It's a heartache either way,
But beautiful!

And I'm thinking if you were mine
I'd never let you go,
And that would be but beautiful I know.",But Beautiful,
Beth McDonald,"It had to be you, it had to be you.
I wandered around and finally found the somebody who
Could make me be true, could make me feel blue,
And even be glad just to be sad thinkin' of you.

Some others I've seen might never be mean
Might never be cross or try to be boss,
But they wouldn't do.
For nobody else gave me a thrill.
With all your faults, I love you still,
It had to be you, wonderful you,
It had to be you.

It had to be you, it had to be you.
I wandered around and finally found somebody who
Could make me be true, could make me be blue,
And even be glad just to be sad thinkin' of you.

Some others I've seen might never be mean
Might never be cross or try to be boss,
But they wouldn't do.

For nobody else gave me a thrill.
With all your faults, I love you still.

It had to be you, wonderful you

It had to be you.",It Had to Be You,2008
Beth McDonald,"Won't you play the music so the cradle can rock
To a lullaby in ragtime
Sleepy hands are creeping to the end of the clock
Play a lullaby in ragtime
You can tell the sandman is on his way
By the way
That they play
As still, as the trill, of a thrush, in a twilight high

So you can hear the
Rhythm of the ripples on the side of the boat

As you sail away to dreamland
High above the moon you hear a silvery note
As the sandman takes your hand
So rock-a-by my baby
Don't you cry my baby
Sleepy-time is nigh
Won't you rock me to a ragtime lullaby
So rock-a-by my baby

Don't you cry my baby
Sleepy-time is nigh
Won't you rock me to a ragtime lullaby",Lullaby in Ragtime,2008
Beth Nielsen Chapman,"I will pledge my heart
To the love we share
Through the good and the bad times too
I'll forsake my rest
For your happiness
'Til my death I will stand by you

With God as my witness
This vow I will make
To have and to hold you
No other to take
For rich or for poor
Under skies grey or blue
'Til my death I will stand by you

There are wars and there are rumors
Of wars yet to come
Temptations we'll have to walk through
Though others may tremble
I will not run
'Til my death I will stand by you

I will put on the armor of faithfulness
To fight for a heart that is true
'Til the battle is won, I will not rest
'Til my death I will stand by you

With God as my witness
This vow I will make
To have and to hold you
No other to take
For rich or for poor
Under skies grey or blue
'Til my death I will stand by you

'Til the battle is won
I will not run
'Til my death I will stand by you

Beth Nielsen Chapman,"Charlie's got a gold watch 
Don't seem like a whole lot 
After thirty years of drivin' 
Up and down the interstate 
But Charlie's had a good life 
And Charlie's got a good wife 
And after tonight she'll no longer 
Be countin' the days 

Eighteen wheels and a dozen roses 
Ten more miles on his four day run 
A few more songs on the all night radio 
And he'll spend the rest if his life 
With the one that he loves 

They'll buy a Winnebago 
Set out to find America 
Do a lotta catchin' up 
A little at a time 

With pieces of the old dream 
They're gonna light the old flame 
Doin' what they please 
Leavin every other reason behind 

Eighteen wheels and a dozen roses 
Ten more miles on his four day run 
A few more songs on the all night radio 
And he'll spend the rest if his life 
With the one that he loves

Beth Nielsen Chapman,"There's a lighthouse in the harbor

   Giving guidance with its light

      But I had no one to return to

   As I wandered through the night

   From the first time that I saw you

   Standing silent by the shore

      I knew my search was over

   And I would look for love no   more
Deep in the waters of love I am falling

Sinking like a stone

Deep in my heart I can  hear love callin'

Goin' once, goin' twice, goin gone
    
Goin' once, goin' twice, goin gone
   There's a ship on the horizon

   Makin' its way against the wind
                             
      From the place where I stand watching

   I swear my ship is coming in.


Deep in the waters of love I am falling

Sinking like a stone

Deep in my heart I can  hear love callin'
   
Goin' once, goin' twice, goin gone
               
Goin' once, goin' twice, goin gone

Sinking like a stone

Deep in my heart I can  hear love callin'

",Goin' Gone,1990
Beth Nielsen Chapman,"You can say you love me
And I'll believe that's true
Trusting you is easy
'cause I believe in you
There is nothing I would miss
As long as we're in love like this

[Chorus]
All I have is all I need
And it all comes down to you and me
How far away this world becomes
In the harbor of each others arms

I feel like I've known you forever and ever
Baby that's how close we are
Right here with you is where my life has come together
And where love has filled my heart
You know I'd go anywhere
As long as I have you to care

[Chorus]

Ooh-and with the love you bring
I never want for anything
I found what I've been searching for in you

[Chorus]",All I Have,1990
Beth Nielsen Chapman,"She's wheeled into the hallway
Till the sun moves down the floor
Little squares of daylight
Like a hundred times before
She's taken to the garden
For the later afternoon
Just before her dinner
They return her to her room

CHORUS:
And inside her mind
She is running
She is running in the summer wind
Inside her mind
She is running in the summer wind
Like a child again

The family comes on Sunday
And they hover for awhile
They fill her room with chatter
And they form a line of smiles
Children of her children
Bringing babies of their own
Sometimes she remembers
Then her mama calls her home

CHORUS

Playmate, come out and play with me
(It's raining, it's poring, the old man is snoring)
And bring your dollies three
(Bumped his head on the edge of the bed)
Climb up my apple tree
(Never got up in the morning)
Slide down my rain barrel
(Rain, rain, go away)
Into my cellar door
(Come again another day)
And we'll be jolly friends
(Little Johnny wants to play)
Forevermore
(Some more)

And inside her mind
She is running
She is running in the summer wind
Like a child again
",Child Again,1990
Beth Nielsen Chapman,"Sometimes you wonder how much I care
I get so distracted running nowhere
And I take for granted our love is secure
But if I started losing you, one thing is sure

I'd be down on my knees
Ready to pray, darlin'
Down on my knees
Making you stay
I'd be begging you please
Don't take your love from me
I'd be down on my knees

I learned to be strong a long time ago
And I can face any wind no matter how hard it blows
But I'd have to be stronger than I want to be
If I had to live without you loving me

I'd be down on my knees
Ready to pray, darlin'
Down on my knees
Making you stay
I'd be begging you please
Don't take your love from me
I'd be down on my knees

No one matters more in my life
Or makes me feel like you make me feel inside
And I've come far enough to know
Love's worth never letting go of
And love is not a matter of pride

I'd be down on my knees
Ready to pray, darlin'
Down on my knees
Making you stay
I'd be begging you please
Don't take your love from me
I'd be down on my knees
",Down on My Knees,1990
Beth Nielsen Chapman,"My oh my, time sure flies
I like what you've done to your hair
I've been fine, yeh these boys are mine
That must be your little girl there

Some friendships grow distant with time
And it's no wonder, Emily, so much can change
We're too far to visit, too busy to write
But a closeness between us remains

Best friends are made through smiles and tears
And sometimes that fades over miles and years
But I knew right away when I saw you again
Emily, we'll always be friends

I still sing now and then
Mostly at weddings for friends
And I just bet you still get
A yearning to paint now and then

They tore down our whole street
Now there's a bank where the house was we shared back in school
Remember we both have each other to thank
For all the boyfriends we're not married to

""Stay as you are and you'll go far""
You signed my yearbook
""Don't forget me when you're a big star""

We can't stay, it's gettin' late
And they said not to let you get tired
We'll just be up the street
The number's right here by your side

Oh no, it's no trouble
I don't want to hear about how all this changes my plans
I'll see you tomorrow
Call me tonight, Emmy, please let me do what I can

Best friends are made through smiles and tears
And sometimes that fades over miles and years
But I knew right away when I saw you again
Emily, we'll always be friends",Emily,1990
Beth Nielsen Chapman,"Seems like after all we've been through
We would have learned by now
Never to fight for gets the last word
It doesn't matter anyhow
But 'round and 'round we go in circles
Trying to work things through
And sometimes it feels like miles between us
But I keep coming back to you

CHORUS:
And it's rough
And it's tough
And it's harder than anything I've ever tried to do
But I love you so much that in spite of the struggle
I keep coming back to you

Hold me now, just think about this room
That we have shared so long
We've studied that map of cracks on the ceiling
Talking till the break of dawn
There is something strong as history
Telling me this love is true
They say ""Follow your heart and you'll be happy""
So I keep coming back to you
",I Keep Coming Back to You,1990
Beth Nielsen Chapman,"I was swinging on the swings when I was a little girl
Trying to get a handle on the big, wide world
When I noticed all the grass in the cracks in the concrete
I said, ""Where there's a will, there's a way around anything""

CHORUS:
Life holds on
Given the slightest chance
For the week and the strong
Life holds on

There was a third grade boy that we knew in school
He was found face down in a swimming pool
And as they worked on that kid every minute was an hour
And when his eyes fluttered open we could feel that power

CHORUS

Sirens screaming down my street
Fading as they go
Whining somewhere far away
To someone I don't know
Still, I say a little prayer
There's always hope
Life holds on

Through the window in the kitchen I can see outside
My kids taking turns coming down the slide
I try not to worry as they grow a little every day
I've just got believe they're gonna find their way
",Life Holds On,1990
Beth Nielsen Chapman,"Fingers press the keys for interface
The printer taps the words across the page
We have gotten men upon the moon
And babies from a spoon
In this high tech finely tuned computer age

CHORUS:
But we've got no system
No system for love
We've got no system
No system for love

There's this vast land of resources
That won't apply to rules
We've got these prehistoric tools...
These hearts inside of us
But we've got no system for love

Satellites twist pictures home to Earth
And high-rise office files store paperwork
We've got the airwaves in control
And wires strung pole-to-pole
We've got a record of each soul from date of birth

CHORUS

There are temples and steeples
And billions of people
And so much potential
We haven't even touched
'Cause we've got no system
No system for love
",No System for Love,1990
Beth Nielsen Chapman,"Rita's out on the street tonight
Driving through the rain
She's got lots of new reasons not to trust any man again
And even though she'll be alright

She'll never be the same again
She'll move closer to her mama, let her daughter keep her daddy's name
Sometimes you've only got one road and it's a rocky ride
Sometimes there isn't time to think about the tears you've cried

[Chorus]
You take it as it comes
When you've got no way to hide from the hurting inside
When there's nowhere you can really run
You take it as it comes

Rita's out on the street tonight
Midnight feels so strange
She's got her baby in the car seat
Her sleeping face flashing as the signals change

They roll up to the corner for the seventh time
As they circle around the square
The movie crowd is spilling out across the street
Rita sits at that light and stares
And she wonders if there's any reason in the world to try
And she glances at her little girl and she remembers why

[Chorus]

And one foot goes in front of the other
And one day rolls into the next
Sometimes you've got to let your heart be numb
And take it as it comes

[Chorus]",Take It as It Comes,1990
Beth Nielsen Chapman,"What a fool
Thought I'd wrapped up the case
I went and promised my heart
But you just laughed in my face
What a fall
Never thought I'd forget you
I gave it all
But I've got no regret
I loved you
I cared

[Chorus:]
So if by chance you walk my way
And feel the joy and pain of yesterday
You'll never need a reason to pretend
A simple smile is all I ask
The smile you hide behind your painted mask
Somewhere between a stranger and a friend

What a crime
When you want someone so
I put my heart on the line
But I had to let go
It's over

[Chorus]

Now, my love, it's over

(You'll never know you've hurt me baby) walk my way",Walk My Way,1990
Beth Nielsen Chapman,"I went home for Christmas
To the house that I grew up in
Going back was something after all these years
I drove down Monterey Street
And felt a little sadness
When I turned left on Laurel and the house appeared
And I snuck up to that rocking chair
Where the winter sunlight slanted on the screened-in porch
And I stared out past the shade tree
That my laughing daddy planted on the day that I was born

And I let time go by so slow
And I made every moment last
And I thought about years
How they take so long
And they go so fast

Across the street the Randol's oldest daughter must have come home
Her two boys built a snowman by the backyard swings
I thought of old man Randol and his Christmas decorations
And how he used to leave them up till early spring

And I though of all the summers
That I paced that porch and swore I'd die of boredom there
And I thought of what I'd give to feel another summer linger
Where a day feels like a year

And I let time go by so slow
And I made every moment last
And I thought about years
How they take so long
And they go so fast

Then the door flew open, and my mother's voice was laughing
As she called back to my daddy, ""Come look who's here""
And I thought about years

And I let time go by so slow
And I made every moment last
And I thought about years
How they take so long
And they go so fast",Years,1990
Beth Nielsen Chapman,"Baby, dance with me slow
Let me fly with you
While the band plays low
Till the night is through
The lights of the candles
Look like stars around the room
I'll try to be careful
But I know I'm not immune
'cause I just can't imagine
How I'd ever come to harm
With this feeling that I'm feeling
As I'm drowning in your arms
Baby, dance with me slow
Till we barely move
Let that crowd rock and roll
While we share this groove
And float like two shadows
In and out and in between
Those faces around us
At the edges of this dream
And it won't even matter
If they stare as we go by
I'm aware of only your love
In this world of you and I

Beth Nielsen Chapman,"Fast asleep in the dawn of ages
The soul of every child
Has waited to be born a stranger
Underneath the drum of his mothers heart
Lying deep in a dream of darkness
Where fear has never gone
Each spark of a life is started
Blind and pure to the world we come
Blind and pure to the world we come
Each of us a dancer to the drum
Each of us a dancer to the drum
Blind and pure we come
One is born into a life of hunger
One will be a king or a rich man's son
One will kill out of greed or anger
One will give his life for another one
There are smiles in the lies of innocence
There are blooms in the walls of stone
And we will see ourselves
In the eyes of everyone we have ever known
Everyone we have ever known
And the heart, the heart will ever be a witness
And precious time, no treasure is worth
And the child, the child will carry our existence
Through the days that we have on earth

Innocent and young
With a thirst for love
A search for fun
I grew up fast
This mirror in my soul
Reflecting back
What I'd been told
Like every other child I've been
Jaded from the outside in
I don't know
All I've got is feelings
I came tumbling through my mother
To this world of different meanings
I don't know
It comes down to believing
And I'm looking for someone
Who has a picture of the answer
I started out
Guilty of no crime
So much to learn
So little time
A speck of life
A tiny grain of sand
A blink in time
Is that all I am
Spending my existence
Trying to make it all make sense

In the time it takes to want me
You can have me
And you'd never have to ask how much I care

Like a star that's traveled years to shine
Like a song that wants to hear the rhyme

And if I get my wish

",In the Time It Takes,1993
Beth Nielsen Chapman,"I remember thinking love was a fool's game
Break your heart you've got your own self to blame
I've played it smart so many times, but that all changed

People fall in love and swear they are so sure
Then they turn around and say it's over
I never trusted love to come any closer
Till the moment you were mine

One moment in time
And I knew why I had waited so long
One look in your eyes
Meant forever from that moment on

Till your heart stops breaking.
Only so many doors you can try,
Till you finally find your way.
Out of the dark, into the light,
No, the clouds won't always be grey.
The sun reappears in the blink of an eye,
And there's only so many tears you can cry. 

There are only so many reasons to give up,
You're not even close.
You got to believe in the power of love,
That's all anyone knows.
And what makes you strong comes from inside,
And as far as weather and woes.
Buckets of rain can fall from the sky,
But there's only so many tears you can cry.

Forget about who's wrong or right.

And we'll laugh, laugh, laugh those tears away.

Then he gets cruel
He don't like her thinking
He's anyone's fool

Silence those eyes
Silence, silence

You're the one my dreams are all about
When I feel this way",When I Feel This Way,1993
Beth Nielsen Chapman,"One moment in the wink of an eye
There was nothing I could say
This strong feeling started up inside
I knew time would not erase away

For you, oh...
My heart is brave, my time is free
I believe deep down in my soul
You hold the key to holding me

All I know is what I feel
Baby, what I feel I can't conceal
I never play those games of mystery
Feelings come and feelings go
In a world where yes means yes and no
You hold the key to holding me

It's so easy to believe someone
When they tell you what you want to hear
I've trusted words that turned to clouds of smoke
As they faded in the atmosphere

But with you, oh...
Those words don't come so easily
I wonder if you even know
You hold the key to holding me

(Repeat Chorus)

One broken heart, you think twice
You feel you can only trust yourself
I've come across that desert
So sure I was never gonna find your love

(Repeat Chorus) 
",You Hold the Key,1993
Beth Nielsen Chapman,"You make me promises that you don't keep
Tears are expensive, honey, words are cheap
You tell me one thing then do something else
And even though I know that all too well

I keep forgiving
I keep forgetting
I keep expecting you to change

You say you will
You say you will
You say you will
But you never do

Love doesn't come with any guarantee
It's give and take a little, that's the key
So I give you every little thing you choose
An you give me back a stack of  I.O.U.'s

There seems to be a pattern here
How can I tell if you're sincere

And the shoreline disappears

Fly back there with me
Where the phosphor shines
Green flashlights from the sea

Our hearts were free from toil
And we made love on the kitchen table
Till the water reached a boil

We hold it all for a little while, don't we...
Kiss the dice, taste the rain
Like little knives upon our tongue
We can do no wrong when the lights come on

And we take the stage like we own the place
As if time were cheap and the night forever young

And the whales will steal my song

Through fireside parties, tears and cheers

And when I was alone I could be Julie Gold
It rang her ""From A Distance"" just like it was my own
I'd pretend I've the voice of Beth Neilsen Chapman
I wrote 'Late Night Grande' with just my right hand happenin'

Oh, the grace of that three-quarter grand

Oh, it's lonesome in this corner at five am
I'd call Harlan Howard, only he'd understand
All those melodies that came to be
Mornings in this corner, that piano and me

And I wished for the left hand like Glenn D. Hardin
I could play Jimmy Webb or perhaps Randy Newman
Ah, it's a blessing, it never met Jerry Lee's feet
Just the hands of those children is all this Kimball needs

I'll let it go, let it go

I've let it go, I've let it go

Your whisper in the wind's embrace
Through diamond stars and songs, and dreams

All conspire to comfort me
From sorrow's edge life's beauty seems
To find your love in everything

To find your love in everything

Even through my shattered heart

You don't know if you'll win or lose, you just have to let go
No I wasn't looking, it's funny how I found you
Just when I thought I'd live my life alone

Maybe it's love that I have longed for
Maybe it's love I should be strong for
I'm tearing down the walls inside, I want to laugh and cry and kiss
Maybe it's love I miss

I've closed my heart down, so many seasons
I didn't want to hurt again, I didn't want to try
So I turned myself to ice and stone, said I don't need anyone
And nobody else would ever make me cry

Maybe it's love I've run away from
Maybe it's love bringing me back home
I'm tearing down the walls inside, I want to laugh and cry and kiss
Maybe it's love I miss

So put your arms around me now, hold me tight
Show me how, no one has every loved me more
I've waited for so long

Maybe it's love, maybe I'm dreaming
Maybe it's love I can believe in
I'm tearing down the walls inside, I want to laugh and cry and kiss
Maybe it's love like this
",Maybe It's Love,2004
Beth Nielsen Chapman,"I had it tough when I was just a little kid
It didn't matter what I thought it didn't matter what I did
I felt the doubt for what I lacked right from the start
It did a number on my head but it could never touch my heart

'Cause I had just enough imagination
Just enough to keep the faith
That somehow I would think of what to do
When I'd get lost in a momentary weakness of emotion

All the angels came along to help me through
Life pulls fast changes
Wind blows past pages
All I see is, I don't need this

Highstrung tight rope walks
Ticking time bomb clocks
Scratch my name off, cut these chains

[Chorus]
I'm free...Kicking out of that prison
I'm free...Singing those words of wisdom
Let it be...Nobody's gonna put the blues inside of me..
And in the stress to be the best I've done it all

I've slammed the doors I've jammed the locks
Laid the bricks, I've built the walls
No one could tell me back then why joy eluded me
Kept bumping into that misery locked up deep down inside of me

Took that rage and I
Turned that page and I
Packed my tools, went back to school
And I've passed my graduation

I hold my Ph. D. in crash test blues
I've paid those dues
I'm free...

And paper scraps and songs
Here I stand in ruby slippers
Three taps takes me home... I'm free...",Free,2005
Beth Nielsen Chapman,"For all the tears, all the times I got lost
For every bridge my heart?s crossed

Look at how your love has changed my life
Woke up all the dreams, I've held inside
All the stars fell in place when you first touched my face
And once again the world felt right

Look at how you knew, you'd found my heart
Deep out of the blues and torn apart
Long before I could see you were so meant for me
You held me in your arms so tight

Love finds a way through time and grace
How sweet to step into this dance
When I never thought my heart
Would get a second chance

Look at how your love has changed my life
Filled me with a hope that shines so bright
That the past closed the book when I turned back to look
At how your love has changed my life

And the past closed the book when I turned back to look
At how your love has changed my life
",Look,2005
Beth Nielsen Chapman,"Love, it's true that when it comes to you
I've tried to keep my two feet on the ground
My, it's strange how quickly life can change
You've got my nights and days all turned around

Waited for it, sweet surrender
Waited for it, endless charm
Waited for it, every moment spent in your arms

Sends me right back into the feeling
When the world melts under your touch
And you toss my heart through the ceiling
No reason not to fall in love

Love I've lost, came at so high a cost
Thought I'll be better off just on my own
Then we kissed and all the fun I'd missed
Felt like a thousand ships turning for home

Waited for it, I'd almost given up
Waited for it, believing you would come
Waited for it, every time I think I should run

You take me right back into the feeling
Where the world melts under your touch
When you toss my heart through the ceiling
No reason not to fall in love

I try to think about the consequences
Second guessing with a backward glance
But my brain doesn't stand a chance
Chained to the crazy dreams my heart has

You send me right back into the feeling
Where the world melts under your touch
And you toss my heart through the ceiling
No reason not to fall in love

You send me right back into the feeling
Where the world melts under your touch
And you toss my heart through the ceiling
No reason not to fall in love
",Right Back Into the Feeling,2005
Beth Nielsen Chapman,"I can't believe that after all this time
You keep slipping back across my mind
Did we maybe leave a love behind
Afraid of what we felt
Other loves I've had have come and gone
I don't know why they just don't last too long
There are questions that go on and on
That time won't tell
Time won't tell me how it might have been
Time won't make what's wrong alright
It can only take me back again
And re-run all those memories in black and white
I watch us kiss goodbye that day
Here's where you turned around and walked away
What were the words that would have made you stay
Time won't tell

You never see the road you didn't take
You never feel the love you fail to make
To never know may be the worst mistake
Cause time won't tell
No, time won't tell...",Time Won't Tell,2005

There are songs I love that catch my breath


When the first chord starts to play
Effortless and true, it's funny but I knew

You would always touch my heart that way



And it hurts so much to let you go


And there are no words to say
But the corner of your smile says all I need to know

You could always touch my heart that way

Sail on my love, life is only a blink in time




Go on and show all those stars what it means to shine


Like a fire that spins inside a spark
As the ashes cool to grey

Kicked up by the wind, dancing through the dark



You will always touch my heart that way

Sail on my sweet love, this world is a blink in time

Go on and show all those stars what it means to shine

Even if the beauty of your face I cannot see


Only you could touch my heart that way

You can always touch my heart that way

The day that I began
Trying to love you
The secrets I have kept
The nights I haven't slept

Trying to love you
Trying to love you... No one's come as close or gone so far
Trying to love you... I've lost and found myself in who you are

Squandered all my luck
But I cannot give up

She's used her pain to build a concrete wall
She's rolled her angry words into a fist
But that's not who she is
That's not who she is

I wrote her off that day as if she'd died
Said if she burns in hell, well I won't give a damn
But that's not who I am,
That's not who I am
Lost behind the masks we wear
The barbed wire fences of our fear
We drag each other through these tears
And strike the wounds that scar
But that's not who we are
That's not who we are
Someday I'll hold her, for this I pray
That time and grace will roll the stone away
And we'll love each other with open hearts

Just for who we are

A child who tried to just be good

Though I don't know who for,
Hoping someone else, somewhere near knows the score,
Could you please knock me off my feet for awhile,
Could you please knock me off my feet for awhile.

When there's a galaxy of emptiness tonight,
A whole wide galaxy of emptiness tonight,
A whole wide galaxy of emptiness tonight.

Monkey see, monkey do,
I spent my whole life surrounded by people like you,
With all that expectation to weigh heavy on your heart, And
No ideas to later tear it all apart, Won't you please knock
Me off my feet for awhile, Won't you please knock me off my
Feet for awhile.

When there's a galaxy of emptiness tonight,
A whole wide galaxy of emptiness tonight,
A whole wide galaxy of emptiness tonight.

Give in too fast then give in to no,
Once they've got you where they want you,
They don't wanna know.

I could leave or I could stay,
It doesn't make a bit of difference any more anyway,
With each and every circumstance,
I lose knowledge and gain innocence,
You won't find me grieving,
There's no regret in leaving,
When I had to come here,
Like I know I had to come here,
I can see I had to come here,
For my view to be clear,
For my view to be clear.

It's easy to forget how far we've come,
How near I feel to where we first begun,
Pushed it too far,
I won't pull it too slow,
Cos' where this story ends depends on how far we go.

Lost out in the rain
Afraid of the dark 
Still in pain

Didn't change that much?
Fluctuations on these sheets 
That you moved to be sure it was us

They got married and divorced in the same day
Now he'd rather know her debt than walking down some street
Another plan in her head, in her head

So many places they have never seen
For everywhere now seems somewhere they must've been
Look him in the eye to see his point of view
But then it goes back to what he always knew

And wouldn't you tell?
Wouldn't you tell?
Wouldn't you tell ?

Well, summer days in Chappel sky
They were they preaching a lie with no black tie
Who'd given and take in the same day
He's tired from sleeping with the dead and could be running
Down some street, another plan in his head, in his head

So many places he had never seen
Now everywhere looks like somewhere he must've been
He's looking everywhere to find a point of view
Realizes it's come back to what he knew

If you were to leave before the morning light
I pray there's an angel who'll hold you tight
Guide you on some higher flight
Somewhere far from here where blue seas run clear

In this world where no one speaks the language
I only want to start a new

For one more forgotten hero, and a World that doesn't care

And renounce temporal obligations.

You play the fool while I play the clown.
We keep time to the beat of an old slave drum.

You tell me that I dream too much
Now I'm serving time in disillusionment.

I don't believe you anymore ... I don't believe you.

I saw a man with a drink in his hand
He had soft brown eyes and coal black hair
And a smile that any girl could understand.

Then he came and he sat down at my table
And he placed his warm hand on mine
And I found myself wanting to kiss him
For temptation was flowing like wine.

And I was almost, almost persuaded
To strip myself of my pride
I was almost, almost persuaded
To push my conscience aside.

Then we danced and he whispered, ""I need you!
Let me take you away, I want to be your man.""
Then I looked into his eyes and I saw it
The reflection of my, my wedding band.

Oh but I was almost, almost persuaded
To let another, let another's lips touch mine

To push my conscience aside

Just catchin' colds and missin' trains

Everything happens to me
I never miss a thing
I've had the measles and the mumps
And every time I play an ace
My partner always trumps
Guess I'm just a fool who never looks before he jumps

Everything happens to me
At first my heart thought you could break this jinx for me
That love would turn the trick to end despair
But know I just can't fool this head that thinks for me
I've mortgaged all my castles in the air
I've telegraphed and phoned
I send an ""Airmail Special"" too
Your answer was ""Goodbye""
And there was even postage due
I fell in love just once
And then it had to be with you

Beth Tuttle,"I'm as restless as a willow in a windstorm
I'm as jumpy as a puppet on a string
I'd say that I had spring fever
But I know it isn't spring

I am starry-eyed and vaguely discontented
Like a nightingale without a song to sing
Oh, why should I have Spring fever
When it isn't even spring?

I keep wishing I were somewhere else
Walking down a strange new street
Hearing words that I have never heard
From a girl I've yet to meet

I'm as busy as a spider spinning daydreams
I'm as giddy as a baby on a swing
I haven't seen a crocus or a rosebud or a robin on the wing
But I feel so gay in a melancholy way

Spiritless hands show no caress. There was no embrace from tearstained faces.

Hate's piercing sound disfigures the soul in the stream of my tears
I lay in their mold!

Do you got any love in your heart? Unfeeling! Unfeeling! Unfeeling!
I touched my innermost self with its healing.
Threw myself down at the feet of its mercy
the stone of my heart met its defeat love emptied me filling me with serenity.

When I took that first step out the door
All I said now follows me around
I'm reminded I'm not like that anymore

I uprooted and miles behind me
Are the faces and the home I love
You've brought to my attention
I'm slowly changing and becoming what I wanted to stop

Isn't that just like a finite mind
Setting out with such righteous indignation
But now I'm at Your feet
Could You look at me with some imagination

The bush before me, I slip my sandals off
I only stopped to look
In the depths of the sea, in the midst of a great storm
I run, I run from You

So remind me why You woke me up
And why You wake me every morn

Held in by Your love

Things that cannot hear or speak at all

Why would I want something that I can control?

I was following a cloud of fire and smoke

But my heart was too weak to understand

So I built an image with my fear and with my gold

I'll be waiting for You to rescue me

Come find me, come find me

Rip the veil between what I see and what is real

Let this fire in my heart be proof

A road I'd stay on for so long

To try and convince me

That Your mercy can be bigger than what I deserve

Knowing that it will never make sense

That I am loved by You, really loved by You

Bearing the awesome weight of sin
And every bitter thought, every evil deed

For through Your suffering I am free
And death is crushed to death and life is mine to live
Won through Your selfless love

Sólo pueden enseñarnos
A vivir en paz, sin odio y libertad,

Ich traf dich in den Straßen
In dieser einen Nacht
Die ganz normale Menschen ändert
Und zu Rebellen macht
Du hörst den Ruf nach Freiheit durch die Stille hallen
Siehst der Masse ins Gesicht
Du hast die Faust geballt, hältst den Atem an
Hier kämpft Wahrheit gegen Pflicht

Komm wir tanzen zusammen im Wasserwerferregen
Dann ist das Feuer unser Bühnenlicht
Und das Tränengas der Nebel
Dieser Traum von Freiheit wird in Erfüllung gehen
Wenn wir gemeinsam auf einer Seite stehen

Zwischen Rauch und Nebelschwaden
Scheint im getrübten Licht
Dein Ideal von Freiheit
Du siehst der Wahrheit ins Gesicht
Du reißt dich los von alten Zwängen
Gehst diesen einen Schritt
Wenn alle Zweifel fallen und zur Gewissheit werden
Gibt es kein Zurück

Komm wir tanzen zusammen im Wasserwerferregen
Dann ist das Feuer unser Bühnenlicht
Und das Tränengas der Nebel
Dieser Traum von Freiheit wird in Erfüllung gehen
Wenn wir gemeinsam auf einer Seite stehen

Oh oh, oh oh
Oh oh, oh oh

Komm wir tanzen zusammen im Wasserwerferregen
Dann ist das Feuer unser Bühnenlicht
Und das Tränengas der Nebel

Wird unser Traum von Freiheit in Erfüllung gehen",Traum von Freiheit,2015
Betrayed,"You pushed too hard, you crossed the line
And uncovered a hunger you can't satisfy

No, no
I said I don't need them
We said we don't need them

Where friendship starts to fall apart 
People change and drift as years pass by

I thought our beliefs would remain 
Throughout the years they'd grow and change 
to reflect all that we've come to know 
But at their heart they'd be the same

We're at the crossroads of our lives 
And our direction's not the same 

Spent half your life fighting for this place 
Now you give up because of your age 
You found a home when you first came around 
But what helped you then now holds you down 

So now that we've run out of time I have one thing to say 
Does growing old mean giving in? 
Well not for me

Don't let it blind you

What did you say'
The way that you act was just the way you were raised'
Well all I can say
Is that you have a choice not to act that way

You're taking it to far and tearing apart
Everything we've built
And there's a price that we pay
For all the violence you create

Betrayed,"Time will tell if we'll overcome this 

Well It falls like the rain, the poverty and the pain 
But no one out there seems to care 
A true tragedy that faces a blind eye 
Addiction and disease destroying peoples lives 

So we fight, we fight 
Through such desperate times 
But the struggle is all uphill 

Yes we fight we fight 
Through such desperate times 
And there's no end in sight 
But still we carry on 

And only time will tell if we can overcome 
But we can never stop, never flinch, and never give up 

Out on the streets deaf, blind, and numb 
To all the suffering that surrounds us 
No one wants to know so they turn their backs 
But we're breaking through their indifference 

And only time will tell if we can overcome 
But we can never stop 
And that lays beyond belief or conviction 
And that lays beyond courage or pride

And we know that 

Time will tell if we'll overcome this 
And we will not, no we'll not give up on the fight",Time Will Tell,2006

Bette Midler,"Oh God, Oh God, life is real life 
Is when you wanna sing Polly-Wally-Doodle all the day,
Well you know, I may well be a sequel to Jaws,
In which a shark is attacked by a great white woman,
Actually I'm not going to do the sequel to Jaws at all, 
I'm making the sequel to 'Emanuelle', 
I call it 'Temple Emanuelle'. Actually it's not dirty at all,
It's just a lot of kissing and mezzuzas.
And er, one singular sub-plot,
In which a woman who has an un-natural relationship with a Kreplach. 
I know there must be one or two of you out there,
Who haven't got the vaguest idea what the hell is a Kreplach, 
And to both of you I say,
A Kreplach is a person from Kreplachia,
Which is a very small fishing nation wedged between Estonia and Latvia, 
You don't hear from them too much since the iron curtain fell! 
But every now and again, one or two Kreplach's manage to escape
But never to Cleveland!

Yes!
Not true!

What?
There we have one Kreplach.
Who one Kreplach that managed to get to Cleveland!
In fact, I venture to say that was the Kreplach that ate Cleveland!

No, Belle Barth used to say:

Who do you think I spy?
A girl with ebony fire eyes.
Soft and low do she cry.
Now what could be such a source of pain?
I so boldly inquire.
Pointing finger Havana way,
These three words which transpire:

She told me that only in Miami
Is Cuba so far away.
Only in Miami.
My story, she goes this way.
Fish may fly through the purple keys,
Golden birds take to air.
I am bound to the earth, it seems.
My life can be so unfair.
Only in Miami
Is Cuba so far away.
Only in Miami
Is Cuba so far away.

Standing on the shoreline waiting,
Everyone anticipating.
I can hear the broken hearted say,
Only in Miami
Is Cuba so far away.

And she cries for her child without a mother.
And she cries for her son without a father.
And she cries for herself without a lover.
Can't face another day.
Chase the blues away.
I thought I heard her mumble as she
Turned away

Only in Miami
Is Cuba so far away.
Only in Miami
Is Cuba so far away.

Everyone anticipating.
I can hear the broken hearted say,

Track twenty nine, boy you can gimme a shine
I can afford to board a Chattanooga Choo Choo
I've got my fare and just a trifle to spare
 
You leave the Pennsylvania station 'bout a quarter to four
Read a magazine and then you're in Baltimore
Dinner in the diner, nothing could be finer
Than to have your ham 'n' eggs in Carolina

Bette Midler,"Otto titsling,inventor and crout,
Had nothing to get very worked up about.
His inventions were failures, his future seemed bleak.
He fled to the opera at least twice a week.

One night at the opera he saw an aida
Who's bust was so big it would often impede her.
Bug-eyed he watched her fall into the pit,
Done in by the weight of those terrible tits.

Oh, my god! there she blows!
Aerodynamically this girl was a mess.
Otto eye-balled the diva lying comatose amongst the reeds,And he suddenly felt the fire of inspiration Flood his soul. 
He ran back to his workshop
Where he futzed and futzed and futzed.

For otto titsling had found his quest:
To lift and mold the female breast;
To point the small ones to the sky;
To keep the big ones high and dry!

Every night he'd sweat and snort
Searching for the right support.
He tried some string and paper clips.
Hey! he even tried his own two lips!

Well, he stiched and he slaved
And he slaved and he stitched
Until finally one night, in the wee hours of morning,
Otto arose from his workbench triumphant.
Yes! he had invented the worlds first
Over-the-shoulder-boulder-holder.
 Hooray!

Exhausted but ecstatic otto ran out to the diva Bearing the prototype in his hot little hand.
Now, the diva did not want to try the darn thing on.
But,after many initial mishaps,
She finally did.
And the sigh of relief that issued forth
From the her mouth
Was so loud that it was mistaken by some
To be the early onset of the seraken winds
Which would often roll through the schwarzwald
With a vengeance!
Ahhhhh-i!

Butlittle did otto know,
At the moment of his greatest triumph,
Lurking under the diva's bed
Was none other than the very worst
Of the french patent thieves,
Phillip DeBrassiere.
And phil was watching the scene
With a great deal of interest!

Later that night, while our broom hilda slept,
Into the wardrobe phillip softly crept.
He fumbled through knickers and corsets galore,
'til he found otto's titsling and he ran out the door.

Crying, ""oh, my god!
 What joy! What bliss!
I'm gonna make me a million from this!
Every woman in the world will want to buy one.
I can have all the goods manufactures in Taiwan.""

The result of this swindle is pointedly clear:
Do you buy a Titsling or do you buy a Brassiere?","""Otto Titsling""",1985

Bette Midler,"Some say love, it is a river, that drowns the tender reed
Some say love, it is a razor, that leaves your soul to bleed
Some say love, it is a hunger, an endless aching need
I say love, it is a flower, and you, its only seed

Its the heart afraid of breaking, that never learns to dance
Its the dream afraid of waking, that never takes the chance
Its the one who won't be taking, who cannot seem to give
And the soul afraid of dying, that never learns to live

When the night has been too lonely and the road has been too long
And you think that love is only for the lucky and the strong
Just remember in the winter, far beneath the bitter snows
Lies the seed, that with the sun's love in the spring becomes the rose",The Rose,1988
Bette Midler,"Every night while I'm undressin'

I pray the Lord my soul to keep
Angels on my left and right
To keep me safe all through the night

There's a place way up high
Starry bright there, through the night there
Close your eyes, let your wishes fly
You'll be in Dreamland by and by

Dimpled and drowsy, off you go
Over the treetops, sliding down a rainbow
Sleepyhead, curl up in your bed
And 'til the sun says, ""Rise and shine""
Sleep warm in Dreamland, baby mine

There's a place worlds away
Time has wings there, green with springs there
Smiles and songs bloom on every tree
Only in Dreamland, just wait and see

Deep down inside us, a child's still there
Wishing for Dreamland, knowing that it's somewhere
Though it may seem so far away
If you believe that dreams come true
You'll find a Dreamland waiting for you
Mmm, go to sleep now, dear

On a little side street in old Bombay
And met a sentimental oriental

Had a manner too bold and much too free

I discovered much to my regret

She's the girl friend of the whirling dervish
She's the sweetest one he's found
But ev'ry night, in the mellow moonlight
When he's out dervishing with all his might
She gives him the run-around

All the boy friends of the whirling dervish
Are his best friends to his face
But there's no doubt, when he isn't about
They all come hurrying to take her out
She leads him a dizzy pace

He dreams of a Hindu honeymoon
He doesn't dream that ev'ry night when he goes out
To make an honest rupee
She steps out to make a lotta whoopee

Oh, the love song of the whirling dervish
Has a sweet and tender sound
But will he burn if he ever should learn
That while he's doing her a real good turn
She gives him the runaround

Now I'm more debonair, ssh, break
And I sell it here, I start this step, see?
And then I build it, double it

And lead her on the floor

Would always smile hello

Then love slipped through our fingers

I start remembering
Everything
You're gone and yet
There's still a feeling deep inside
That you will always be

""This next story is a true story.

It concerns two of my favorite subjects:

industrial theft . . . and-a t-ts!

Mmm, what a combo! This is the story . . .

The inventor of the modern foundation garment

that we women wear today was a German scientist

and opera lover by the name of Otto Titsling!

This is a true story.

His name was Otto Titsling.

What happened to Otto Titsling shouldn't happen to a schnauzer.

It's a very sad story. I feel I have to share it with you.""


Otto Titsling, inventor and kraut,

had nothing to get very worked up about.

His inventions were failures, his future seemed bleak.

He fled to the opera at least twice a week.


One night at the opera he saw an Aida

who's t-ts were so big they would often impede her.

Bug-eyed he watched her fall into the pit,

done in by the weight of those terrible t-ts.


Oh, my god! There she blows!

Aerodynamically this bitch was a mess.

Otto eyeballed the diva lying comatose amongst the reeds,

and he suddenly felt the fire of inspiration

flood his soul. He knew what he had to do!

He ran back to his workshop

where he futzed and futzed and futzed.


For Otto Titsling had found his quest:

to lift and mold the female breast;

to point the small ones to the sky;

to keep the big ones high and dry!


Every night he'd sweat and snort

searching for the right support.

He tried some string and paper clips.

Hey! He even tried his own two lips!


Well, he stitched and he slaved

and he slaved and he stitched

until finally one night, in the wee hours of morning,

Otto arose from his workbench triumphant.

Yes! He had invented the worlds first

over-the-shoulder-boulder-holder. Hooray!


Exhausted but ecstatic he ran

down the street to the diva's house

bearing the prototype in his hot little hand.

Now, the diva did not want to try the darn thing on.

But, after many initial misgivings,

she finally did.

And the sigh of relief that issued forth

from the diva's mouth

was so loud that it was mistaken by some

to be the early onset of the Siroccan Winds

which would often roll through the Schwarzwald

with a vengeance!

Ahhhhh-I!


But little did Otto know,

at the moment of his greatest triumph,

lurking under the diva's bed

was none other than the very worst

of the French patent thieves,

Philippe DeBrassiere.

And Phil was watching the scene

with a great deal of interest!


Later that night, while our Brun Hilda slept,

into the wardrobe Philippe softly crept.

He fumbled through knickers and corsets galore,

'til he found Otto's titsling and he ran out the door.


Crying, ""Oh, my god! What joy! What bliss!

I'm gonna make me a million from this!

Every woman in the world will wanna buy one.

I can have all the goods manufactured in Taiwan.""


""Oh, thank you!""


The result of this swindle is pointedly clear:

Do you buy a titsling or do you buy a brassiere?


""Ohhh! Thank you!""

Bette Midler,"I held you close to me
Once in a distant dream,
Far from the shores of my fear.
I sailed on the ocean where
All I imagined could happen,
And now you are here.

It's so hard to touch
What is out of our hands,
To know and to trust
What the heart understands.

Only the ones who believe
Ever see what they dream,
Ever dream what comes true.

Life gives us magic and
Life brings us tragedy.
Everyone suffers some loss.
Still we have faith in it,
Childlike hope.
There's a reason that outweighs the cost.

And gravity throws
All these rules in our way.
And sometimes the sprit
Refuses to play.

Only the ones who believe
Ever see what they dream,
Ever dream what comes true.

And oh, love,
Turn me around in your arms.
And in this dream we share
Let us not miss one kiss.

And add my regrets
To the tears in the rain
For that's what the color
Of roses contain.

Only the ones who believe
Ever see what they dream,
Ever dream,
Ever dream what comes true.",Color of Roses,2000

He was the light that I'd bless.
He took my last chance of happiness.
So God give me strength.

I can't hold on to him.

And I'm lost in imagining
Everything that kind of love is worth
As I tumble back down to the earth.

This bell is rung out.
He was the light that I'd bless.
He took my last chance of happiness.
So God give me strength.

God, if he'd grant me his indulgence and decline,
I might as well wipe him from my memory.
Fracture the spell as he becomes my enemy.
And maybe I was washed out
Like a lip print on a shirt.
See, I'm only human, I want him to hurt.
I want him, I want him to hurt.

Since I lost the power to pretend
That there could ever be a happy ending.

Bette Midler,"Girl, we've got work to do
Pass me the paint and glue

Perfect isn't easy but it's me
When one knows the world is watching
One does what one must

Some minor adjustments darling
Not for my vanity but for humanity
Each little step a pose

See, how the breeding shows
Sometimes, it's too much for even me
When all of the world says yes

Then, who am I to say no?
Don't ask a mutt to strut like a showgirl
No, girl, you need a pro

Not a flea or a flaw, take a peek at that paw
La, da-da, dee, dee, da
Perfection becomes me, n'est ce pas?

Unrivaled, unruffled I'm beauty unleashed
(Yeah)
Jaws drop, hearts stop, so classic and classy
We're not talkin' Lassie

La, ah, ooh, aroo
Ruff, ruff ruff ruff ruff
Ruff-ruff-ruff-ruff-ruff-ruff-ruff-arow

Though many covet my bone and bowl
They're barkin' up the wrong tree
You pretty pups all over the city

I have your hearts and you have my pity
Pretty is nice, but still, it's just pretty
Perfect, my dear, is me
",Perfect Isn't Easy,2006
Bette Midler,"Ohhhh, oh, oh, oh, ohhh.
It must have been cold there in my shadow,
To never have sunlight on your face.
You were content to let me shine, that's your way.
You always walked a step behind.

So I was the one with all the glory,
While you were the one with all the strength.
A beautiful face without a name for so long.
A beautiful smile to hide the pain.

Did you ever know that you're my hero,
And everything I would like to be?
I can fly higher than an eagle,
For you are the wind beneath my wings.

It might have appeared to go unnoticed,
But I've got it all here in my heart.
I want you to know I know the truth, of course I know it.
I would be nothing without you.

Did you ever know that you're my hero?
You're everything I wish I could be.
I could fly higher than an eagle,
For you are the wind beneath my wings.

Did I ever tell you you're my hero?
You're everything, everything I wish I could be.
Oh, and I, I could fly higher than an eagle,
For you are the wind beneath my wings,
'cause you are the wind beneath my wings.

Oh, the wind beneath my wings.
You, you, you, you are the wind beneath my wings.
Fly, fly, fly away. You let me fly so high.
Oh, you, you, you, the wind beneath my wings.
Oh, you, you, you, the wind beneath my wings.

Fly, fly, fly high against the sky,
So high I almost touch the sky.

Thank God for you, the wind beneath my wings.",Wind Beneath My Wings [Instrumental],2006

In the lane, snow is glistening

As we go along,

We'll have lots of fun with mister snowman,
Until the other kids knock him down.

Though your nose gets a chilling
We'll frolic and play, the Eskimo way,
Walking in a winter wonderland.

Oh, the weather outside is frightful,
But the fire is so delightful,
And since we've no place to go,
Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow.

And I brought some corn for popping;
The lights are turned way down low,

Bei mir bist du schön, again I'll explain
It means you're the fairest in the land

To ease my mind
I need to find, find someone to call mine

You can't hurry love
No, you just have to wait
She said love don't come easy

You can't hurry love
No, you just have to wait
You gotta trust, give it time
No matter how long it takes

But how many heartaches
Must I stand before I find a love
To let me live again
Right now the only thing
That keeps me hangin' on
When I feel my strength
Yeah it's almost gone
I remember mama said

You can't hurry love
No, you just have to wait

How long must I wait
How much more can I take
Before loneliness will cause
My poor heart to break?

No I can't bear to live my life alone
I grow impatient for a love to call my own
But when I feel that I, that I simply can't go on
These precious words keeps me hangin' on

For some tender arms

Better Than a Thousand,"You've got to let me grow, got to let me be me.
Did you really think that time would freeze?
A stagnant stand still just see - see what you've got?
To know you've got to grow, got to move from your spot.

When summers gone and autumn comes and
Everything has changed.
Why is it so strange? Why should we complain?

Stuck in the scene circles as fads grow and die.
But positive living and thoughtful thinking don't apply.
We must learn what to embrace and what to throw away
Or we'll make the same mistakes tomorrow that we beat yesterday.

When summers gone and autumn comes and
Everything has changed.
Why is it so strange? Why should we complain?

When seasons change will I stay same?

Under you, let go completely feeling you take over me.

Well we held jobs in this bar down at 3rd and San Vicente. 
And Ramen Noodles at 4:30 in the morning,

I grew up in the 80s in the palisades
I was listening to Devo
And everybody catered to your needs
Were voted ""most likely to succeed""
Holly came out, and Billy got paid
But Jenny got pregnant the first time she got laid

[Chorus:]
All my rage sits inside
And even the finest things are leaving you hollow
And all my days left behind
And even the finest things are leaving you hollow

Cut to an interior view:
Holly married well, but so did you
One was black, one was blue
I was watching the days go by
Could you be seeing a silly dream
Where Billy lives on Prozac and nicotine?
Holly got a G.E.D. living in maternity
Nursing her broken heart for the love she lost

[Chorus]

And the sky is blue, but so are you
Mary takes a drage off a cigarette
And the stereo is coming up behind her
Like she needs something to remind her
That life is richer in a minor key
Bill and Holly disagree, but I don't think so

Your daddy's knocking on your door

I only feel it when you go away
Waiting for you to return

Don't fight it if it feels good (don't fight it)
You hide it but you never should (don't hide it)

And stars collide and the air's alive
Or was it just like those promises that you made
On our last night?

I remember waking up with you
The days doing nothing
You meant more to me then than I think you ever knew.
But you were gonna be a doctor, movie star
A poet at a Nobel seminar
I hope the world never tore that out of you

How could I ever be so blind?
You are special, I thought I'd never lose my mind

Fantasize the smell of body lotion
Who could ever stand in your shoes

How do you deal with all this hurt?
You fail to see
Hypocrisies

You feel the need
Feel the motions
Hard on me
And missed emotions

So in other words
How do you deal with all this hurt?
You fail to see
Hypocrisies

How do you deal?
How do you feel?
You feel the need
You feel in me
So hail the free",Storm,2006
Bettie Serveert,"From where I stand, I can see
They've got the upper hand of me
Reminds me of this world at last
Simply changes much to fast for me

And when they call out, will I hear them?
And when they fall out, will I see them?

This yellow light on the crowd
And colors way to loud to see
Reveal their drive, we could change it
Try to rearrange it

They call me a tom boy and I let them
'Cause only a tom boy could forget them
And simply change it

They call me a tom boy and I love it
'Cause only a tom boy could stand above it
By simply changing",Tom Boy [DVD][Live],2006
Bettie Serveert,"What they call love
Is just mother nature trying to have her way
Like a chemical inside your mind
It turns you deaf and dumb and blind so easily

When I care more than I care to know
I just play it down, so my fears don't show
How many times can I push them aside
I don't know

And here's to the fear
That blinded me all those years
And here's to the times
When I almost lost my mind

I take care of myself
I don't need no one else
But I love the way you say my name
So sweetly

I wonder should I trust in you
Or anyone, no matter who
You say you love me like a friend
Is this for real or just pretend, oh, no offense

And here's to the fear
That blinded me all those years
And here's to the times
When I almost lost my mind

I said to myself
I don't need no one else
But I love the way you say my name",What They Call Love,2006
Bettine Clemen,"Oh, Danny boy, the pipes, the pipes are calling
From glen to glen, and down the mountain side.
The summer's gone, and all the roses falling,
It's you, it's you must go and I must bide.

But come ye back when summer's in the meadow,
Or when the valley's hushed and white with snow,
It's I'll be here in sunshine or in shadow,
Oh, Danny boy, oh Danny boy, I love you so!

But when ye come, and all the flowers are dying,
If I am dead, as dead I well may be,
You'll come and find the place where I am lying,
And kneel and say an Ave there for me.
And I shall hear, though soft you tread above me,
And all my grave will warmer, sweeter be,
For you will bend and tell me that you love me,
And I shall sleep in peace until you come to me!",Danny Boy,1994
Betty,"Ooh
Ooh

Who's peeking out from under a stairway
Who's calling a name that's lighter than air
Who's yelling down, oh give me a rainbow
Everyone knows its Windy

Who's tripping down the streets of the city
Smiling at everybody she sees
Who's reaching out to capture a rainbow
Everyone knows its Windy

And Windy has stormy eyes
A flash of the sound of lies
And Windy has wings to fly
Above the clouds
Above the clouds
Above the clouds
Above the clouds

And Windy has stormy eyes
A flash of the sound of lies
And Windy has wings to fly
Above the clouds

Betty,"Picture yourself in a boat on a river
With tangerine trees and marmalade skies.
Somebody calls you, you answer quite slowly,
A girl with kaleidoscope eyes.

Cellophane flowers of yellow and green
Towering over your head.
Look for the girl with the sun in her eyes
And she's gone.

Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Lucy in the sky with diamonds, ah, ah

Follow her down to a bridge by the fountain
Where rocking horse people eat marshmallow pies.
Everyone smiles as you drift past the flowers
That grow so incredibly high.

Newspaper taxis appear on the shore
Waiting to take you away
Climb in the back with your head in the clouds 
And you're gone.

Picture yourself on a train in a station
With plasticine porters with looking glass ties,
Suddenly someone is there at the turnstile,
The girl with kaleidoscope eyes.",Lucy in the Sky With Diamonds,1999
Betty,"I want to see Paris
Insane on the Seine
I want to do that bull run thing in Spain
I want to go to England
And walk down Penny Lane
Half a pint in Ireland may wash away my pain
I'm stuck in mud
Spinnin' my wheels
And I'm all alone on the road
To Nowheresville
I want to meet a little girl
With French horn lips
And introduce her to my trip
I'll make her smile on the Nile
Hold her hand in Japan
But last thing's first for all my plans
I'm stuck in mud
Spinnin' my wheels
And I'm all alone on the road
To Nowheresville
I'm on my way
I'm almost nowhere
I'm almost everything I swore I'd never be
When I get there
Then I'll go somewhere
I'm gonna pay my last respects
And get the hell out of there
Out of nowhere
I'm stuck in mud
Spinnin' my wheels
And I'm all alone on the road
To Nowheresville
Spinnin' my wheels
And I'm all alone on the road

Betty,"Rust to dust, us to them
Change your mind, change your skin
Life to death, weak to strength
Cash a check, change your sex

Day to night, dark to light
Hard to soft, on to off
Push to shove, hate to love
In and out, it's all about

They're just transformations
Variations, alternations, deviations
You know, Mother Nature rules us all

I move and I go
In time, fast or slow
I move, because
Each time there's some more

Wet to dry, eye to eye
Yin to Yang, pleasure or pain
Good to bad, crazy or sane
You make the rules, then you play the game

Fist to glove, lose or win
You live a life of sin, then you're born again

Big or small, we're all a part

Betty,"It's a perfect day for a fight
Running after me in the pouring rain
Screaming: ""Baby you were right
I need you, I need you""
Calling my name is a twisted game
Cause it wears me down till I love you more
Waking up to us making up makes it better than before

Oh, wind me up tight, convertible nights with you
Oh, I'll give you romance, a hundred last chances too
Sometimes you make it impossible
But I wanna go and get lost with you, my love
I want you to give me all of you

Get to know me, in your backseat
Drive me crazy, then you drive me home
The only place I wanna be
Is with you, is with you
Trying my luck when I work you off
Throwing all your clothes off the second floor
Waking up to us, making up makes it better than before

Oh, wind me up tight, convertible nights with you
