Harry Strutters Hot Rhthym Orchestra,"You ain't never been blue; no, no, no, 
You ain't never been blue, 
Till you've had that mood indigo. 
That feelin' goes stealin' down to my shoes
While I just sit here and sigh, ""Go 'long blues"".

I always get that mood indigo, 
Since my baby said goodbye. 
And in the evenin' when the lights are low, 
I'm so lonely I could cry. 
'Cause there's nobody who cares about me, 
I'm just a poor fool that's bluer than blue can be. 
When I get that mood indigo, 
I could lay me down and die. 

You ain't never been blue; no, no, no, 
You ain't never been blue, 
Till you've had that mood indigo. 
That feelin' goes stealin' down to my shoes
While I just sit here and sigh, ""Go 'long blues"".",Mood Indigo,1994

(Oh yeah)

She's got a family in Carolina
So far away, but she says I remind her of home
Feeling oh so far from home
She never saw herself as a west coaster
Moved all the way 'cause her grandma told her
""Towns, better swim before you drown""

She's a good girl
She's such a good girl
She's a good girl
She feels so good

She's got a book for every situation
Gets into parties without invitations
How could you ever turn her down?
There's not a drink that I think could sink her
How would I tell her that she's all I think about?
Well, I guess she just found out

She's a good girl
She's such a good girl
She's a good girl
She feels so good

She feels so good

I met her once and wrote a song about her
I wanna scream, yeah
I wanna shout it out
And I hope she hears me now

Harry Styles,"Tell me something, tell me something
You don't know nothing, just pretend you do
I need something, tell me something new
Choose your words 'cause there's no antidote
For this curse
Oh, what's it waiting for?
Must this hurt you just before you go?

Oh, tell me something I don't already know
Oh, tell me something I don't already know

Brooklyn saw me, empty at the news
There's no water inside this swimming pool
Almost over, had enough from you
And I've been praying, I never did before
Understand I'm talking to the walls
I've been praying ever since New York

Harry Styles,"Woke up alone in this hotel room
Played with myself, where were you?
Fell back to sleep, I got drunk by noon
I've never felt less cool

We haven't spoke since you went away
Comfortable silence is so overrated
Why won't you ever be the first one to break?
Even the phone misses your call, by the way

I saw your friend that you know from work
He said you feel just fine
I see you gave him my old T-shirt
More of what was once mine

I see it's written, it's all over his face
Comfortable silence is so overrated
Why won't you ever say what you want to say?
Even my phone misses your call, by the way

Maybe one day you'll call me and tell me that you're sorry too
Maybe one day you'll call me and tell me that you're sorry too
Maybe one day you'll call me and tell me that you're sorry too
But you, you never do

Woke up the girl who looked just like you
I almost said your name

We haven't spoke since you went away
Comfortable silence is so overrated
Why won't you ever say what you want to say?
Even my phone misses your call
We haven't spoke since you went away
Comfortable silence is so overrated

Harry Styles,"She worked her way through a cheap pack of cigarettes
Hard liquor mixed with a bit of intellect
And all the boys, they were saying they were into it
Such a pretty face, on a pretty neck

She's driving me crazy, but I'm into it, but I'm into it
I'm kind of into it
It's getting crazy, I think I'm losing it, I think I'm losing it
I think she said ""I'm having your baby, it's none of your business""
""I'm having your baby, it's none of your business"" (None of your, none of your)
""I'm having your baby, it's none of your business""
""I'm having your baby, it's none of your, it's none of your""

It's New York, baby, always jacked up
Whole tunnels, foreign noses always backed up
When she's alone, she goes home to a cactus
In a black dress, she's such an actress

Driving me crazy, but I'm into it, but I'm into it
I'm kind of into it
It's getting crazy, I think I'm losing it, I think I'm losing it
I think she said ""I'm having your baby, it's none of your business""
""I'm having your baby, it's none of your business"" (None of your, none of your)
""I'm having your baby, it's none of your business""
""I'm having your baby, it's none of your, it's none of your""

She sits beside me like a silhouette
Hard candy dripping on me 'til my feet are wet
And now she's all over me, it's like I paid for it
It's like I paid for it, I'm gonna pay for this

It's none of your, it's none of your
""I'm having your baby, it's none of your business""

Meet me in the hallway
I just left your bedroom
Give me some morphine
Is there any more to do?

Just let me know I'll be on the floor, on the floor
Maybe we'll work it out

I really saw an angel

Open up your eyes, shut your mouth and see
That I'm still the only one who's been in love with me
I'll guess I'll be getting you stuck in between my teeth
And there's nothing I can do about it
Broke a finger knocking on your bedroom door
I got splinters in my knuckles crawling across the floor
Couldn't take you home to mother in a skirt that short
But I think that's what I like about it

She's an angel
Only angel
She's an angel
My only angel

I must admit I thought I'd like to make you mine
As I went about my business through the warning signs
End up meeting in the hallway every single time
And there's nothing we can do about it
Told it to her brother and she told it to me
That she's gonna be angel, just you wait and see
When it turns out she's a devil in between the sheets
And there's nothing she can do about it
Hey, hey

Harry Tobias,"Sweet and lovely, sweeter than the roses in May. 
Sweet and lovely, heaven must have sent her my way.
Skies above me never were as blue as her eyes; 
And she loves me, who would want a sweeter surprise?

When she nestles in my arms so tenderly, 
There's a thrill that words cannot express.
In my heart a song of love is taunting me, melody haunting me.

And she loves me, there is nothing more I can say.",Sweet and Lovely,1994

Harry Verbeke,"As a tot, when I trotted in little velvet panties,
I was kissed by my sisters, my cousins, and my aunties.
Sad to tell, it was hell, an inferno worse than Dante's.

So my dear I swore,
""Never, never more!""
On my list, I insisted that kissing must be crossed out.
Now, I find I was blind, and oh my! 
How I lost out!

I could cry salty tears,
Where have I been all these years?
Little wow, tell me now,
How long has this been going on?

There were chills up my spine,
And some thrills I can't define.
Listen, sweet, I repeat,
How long has this been going on?

Oh, I feel that I could melt,
Into Heaven I'm hurled!
I know how Columbus felt,
Finding another world.

Kiss me once, then once more.
What a dunce I was before.
What a break! 
For Heaven's sake!
How long has this been going on?

Dear, when in your arms I creep,
That divine rendezvous,
Don't wake me, if I'm asleep,
Let me dream that it's true!

Kiss me twice, then once more.
That makes thrice, let's make it four!
What a break!

Harry Verbeke,"A country dance was being held in a garden
I felt a bump and heard an ""Oh, beg your pardon""
Suddenly I saw polka dots and moonbeams
All around a pug-nosed dream

The music started and was I the perplexed one
I held my breath and said ""May I have the next one?""
In my frightened arms, polka dots and moonbeams
Sparkled on a pug-nosed dream

There were questions in the eyes of other dancers
As we floated over the floor
There were questions but my heart knew all the answers
And perhaps a few things more

Now in a cottage built of lilacs and laughter
I know the meaning of the words ""Ever after""

Until you've kissed and had to pay the cost,
Until you've flipped your heart and you have lost,
You don't know what love is.

Do you know how a lost heart fears
At the thought of reminiscing,
And how lips that taste of tears
Lose their taste for kissing?

I guess I'll go through life

Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb

You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms

Tells his fairytale
Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain

Und alles dreht sich irgendwie zu schnell

Du bist nicht allein
Nein, du bist nicht allein Christina

Du kommst dir vor wie ein Komet
Der in die Erdumlaufbahn fliegt und verglüht
Du spürst wie du rennst den Regen auf deiner Haut
Durch deine Adern fließt Strom
Du warst noch niemals so gut gelaunt
Als ob dort in der Ferne noch mehr von dir wären
Sie ziehen dich magnetisch an
All die Sterne da draußen die zum Nachthimmel aufsehen

Harvest,"The waves that we create never stand still. Never break to see what it does until. The hurting eyes tell us that we've gone too far, and the torment we touch leads us all. To say the truth, avoid malaise, honesty arise, embrace the day. When we can trust, when we can feel, when we decide what's right or wrong. No. It's not easy, saved by ourselves again. Living with not for, promise to try to savor everything. The wind quickens, energy adored. This vital flame, vitality. Consumes the grade. Endures the pain. No thoughts remain. That will strip away what it really means to live for. We must go on and try.",Hourglass,1997
Harvest,"Now I know why some things never change. Just another foot in the door. Just another life of sorrow. Now I could lie and say he meant nothing. Persistence broke the silence. I've lost a friend. You had to die and leave the broken hearts that followed behind. I can't erase this face that brings me pain. I am in denial for in you was the vision of discipline, truth revealed. I won't let you fall away from my memories. The heart endures unyielding, the times with you won't fade. Burned by the sting of loss for someone so close. Afraid. Receive forgiveness. There's no one to blame. May you live on. No one believed that you held it inside. Blind is the fury that concealed your cries. May you live on. I try to erase this face that brings me pain and leaves me behind this wall, but I won't forget that part of you that would catch me when I'd fall. You will survive in my heart. Engraved in my mind. Doubt will persevere from the spirit that I may never find.",Lament,1997
Harvest,"Inner perception trapped in a soul cage
Human wreckage I leave my liquid face
Who am I senses blurred who's my mind
In this life obscured
Visual progressions leave me no peace

Fence of needs
What's there in desperation what's real
Flawless confusion

Void of emptiness reign my truth
Before my eyes flashes of youth
Memory-nuances pass where's my life
Frayed pictures mass
Insidious deception feelings fade
Ravenous mirrors I praise the
Blackened day
What am I to reality what's in line
Subsequently

Forever turning through a lifetime
Endless burning of soul and mind
Step by step I'm taken through the past
To burn in fear of lies I'm lost mouldering
Oblivions grasp makes my soul burn
Burn

This astray mind has sieged my soul
Forever chained to this tearing cold
I'll never tell the truth from lies
Disbelief covers my eyes I'm lost mouldering
Perpetual pain in this soul burn

Pieces to me strange wrapped up disguise
Reflections of myself in another life

I see it vague before my eyes
Pictures drawn of naked bare lies
It makes no sense to live this mess
Constant until I find my rest
Enemy within a soul in flames
Gaining its pulse breeding inside
Pressure increase drowns my belief
As I unveil myself in me

Harvey Danger,"All I ever wanted to be was a woolly muffler on your naked neck 
Double wrap me when it's cold 
But you pulled a little tight just now 
And I'm afraid I feel a choke hold coming on 

All I ever thought we might come to was second dates 
And flirting eyebrows 
Or maybe even psychic friends 
And we could share a secret language 

And almost definitely make more of it 
Than it was 
But everyone around us would know 
Everyone watching would know 

This is not a walk with walking wounded 
Here's the ball, here's the pole, now where's the tether 
Where's the tether? 
Hands can grow together 

If you're not careful or grateful or whatever 
And I never much cared much too much to begin with 
I will not take your possibilities under my care 
I will not see you on the bus 

You want me to hold your hand 
It's a courtship I can't stand 
And here I thought you were crying because you were happy 
But no no no 

Friends will turn against you 
People disappoint you every time 
So if you've got greatness in you would you do us all a favor 
And keep it to yourself? 

Keep it 
Keep it to yourself

Quit your job and move away with me

Don't let a childhood linger 
They'll take the world apart and break my baby brother's finger 
So he can't shake my hand 

Guard the dead against my legacy 
And lack the wound no more 
Run from nowhere, nowhere follows you 
Burn down the house 

Make sure the family is inside 
Nothing more to tether you 
Also no one there to catch you crying 
Nothing but my famous pillow 

And my father's rocking chair

It all depends on what

You were quite the charmer
And I'll bet the ladies love
A man in armor
You can guess what we
Have missed the most
Since we went off to war
What do we want?
A girl worth fighting for

My girl will think I have no faults
That I'm a major find
How 'bout a girl who's got a brain
Who always speaks her mind?
My manly ways and turn of
Phrase are sure to thrill her
He thinks he's such a lady killer

Unlike any other
Yet the only girl who'd
Love him is his mother

At the door

You don’t know how it hurts me too

With a little understanding
We’ll get to know each other’s ways
With a little bit of patience
We’d never have unhappy days

I love your lovemaking
Never knew it could be such a game
If you ever left me lonely
I know I’d never be the same

You must be going crazy
If you don’t believe that I’m with you
If I had to live without you
I don’t know what I’d ever do

",You Must Be Crazy,1999

"Harvey Mason, Sr.","After we love, we bathe in a glow
Remembering what happened a moment ago
Like after the rain, when the wind breezes a sigh
While it's resting on pillows of sky
Deep in your arms, it's peaceful and warm
Together we lay in a calm that comes after a storm
In a moment or two, we can hear the stars coming through
I love the quiet right after the rain here with you

After the rain, the birds want to fly
The trees all in green hang the leaves out to dry
Like puddles and pools, what your eyes let me see
Are their loving reflections of me
After a while, you touch me and then
I feel like a flower that longs for a shower again

And then lost in a kiss,
I could stay for hours like this
Though i don't know just what magic the raindrops contain
I know that everything's wonderful after the rain",After the Rain,1995

Without a song the road would never bend

So many dreams to wake

Stopped off at the North Pole to spend a holiday
I called on dear old Santa Claus
To see what I could see
He took me to his workshop 
And told his plans to me, so
 
[Chorus]
You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why

He's making a list and checking it twice
Gonna find out who's naughty and nice

He knows when you're a wake
He knows if you've been bad or good

Better not pout, I'm telling you why

With little tin horns and little toy drums
Rooty toot toots and rummy tum tums
Santa Claus is comin' to town
And curly head dolls that toddle and coo
Elephants, boats, and kiddie cars too
Santa Claus is comin' to town
Then kids in Girl and Boy land will have a jubilee
They're gonna build a Toyland all around the Christmas tree
So! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
 
Now Santa is a busy man, He has no time to play
He's got millions of stockings to fill on Christmas day
You'd better write your letter now
And mail it right away
Because he's getting ready
His reindeer's and his sleigh. So

I lie here beside you, just watching you sleep, 
And sometimes I whisper, what I`m thinking of, 
My cup runneth over with love . . . 
 
Sometimes in the evening, when you do not see, 
I study the small things, you do constantly, 
I memorize moments, that I`m fondest of, 
My cup runneth over with love . . . 
 
In only a moment, we both will be old, 
We won`t even notice the world turning cold. 
And so, in this moment, with sunlight above,

Hearing guitars like someone in love.
Sometimes the things I do astound me,

Harvie Swartz,"Before Lord God made the sea or the land
He held all the stars in the palm of his hand
And they ran through his fingers like grains of sand
And one little star fell alone

Then the Lord God hunted through the wide night air
For the little dark star in the wind down there
And he stated and promised he'd take special care
So it wouldn't get lost no more

Now, a man don't mind if the stars get dim
And the clouds blow over and darken him
So long as the Lord God's watching over him
Keeping track how it all goes on

But I've been walking through the night and the day
Till my eyes get weary and my head turns gray
And sometimes it seems maybe God's gone away
Forgetting his promise and the word he'd say

And we're lost out here in the stars
Little stars big stars blowing through the night
And we're lost out here in the stars
Little stars big stars blowing through the night
And we're lost out here in the stars",Lost in the Stars,2000

Hary Sosnik Orchestra,"Johnny could only sing one note
And the note he sings was this, ah

Poor Johnny, one note
Sang out with, ""Gusto""
And just overlorded the place

Poor Johnny, one note
Yelled willy nilly
Until he was blue in the face

For holding one note was his ace
Couldn't hear the brass
Couldn't hear the drum
He was in a class by himself, by gum

Poor Johnny, one note
Got in Aida
Indeed a great chance to be brave

He took his one note
Howled like the North Wind
Brought forth wind that made critics rave
While Verdi turned 'round in his grave

Couldn't hear the flute
Or the big trombone
Ev'ry one was mute
Johnny stood alone

Cats and dogs stopped yapping
Lions in the zoo, all were jealous of Johnny's big trill
Thunder claps stopped clapping
Traffic ceased its roar

And they tell us Niag'ra stood still
He stopped the train whistles
Boat whistles, steam whistles, cop whistles
All whistles bowed to his skill

Sing Johnny one note
Sing out with, ""Gusto""
And just overwhelm all the crowd
Ah

So sing Johnny, one note, out loud

Stories that'll make ya, eyes tear and wet tissue
It's true, I'm Madd like the Rapper
I'm so upset I gotta put it up in my rap before I snapper

After the things I've seen from Atlanta to Queens
To the mean streets of Brooklyn when I was a teen
Back and forth to the Islands, scream when I left
But adapted, and still my dreams haven't left

I only hung with the crack kids we not the best
Me and the ruffest ruffnecks went chest to chest
Now my best friend's locked up north I won't rest
'Til I let him live his dream threw me and I confess

That even though both our hearts was dark his was darker
Best believe when shit got spark he was the sparker
And when the block got hot he was the fire starter
And if I had beef my nigga Roger was a martyr

I wonder, how certain people come in my life
I wonder, why'd I get in so many fights
I wonder, why sometimes things just don't go right
Why I gotta live this life, hey hey

I wonder, how certain people come in my life
I wonder, why'd I get in so many fights
I wonder
Why I gotta live this life, hey hey

Yo, you one of the most important people in my life
They called you Dice but I called you cousin
We was buggin' 'cause I figured that we both had something in common
You loved to chat reggae music and I loved rhymin'

But still they ain't call you Dice for nuttin'
I seen you shoot with the wiliest cats and leave them with nothing
Somethin' must have pleased that bluffer in you
To make you wanna take dough from those tougher than you

Threw out school we made money together
When you was on the floor shootin', I was the side better
And yo we cleaned out them cats and took the scraps
But you wasn't a ruff cat and cats knew that

I knew eventually them thugs would try to hurt you
If I was there, I'd never let nobody hurt you, it's hurtful
I knew they wouldn't let you take the money and run
That's why I shoulda came when you told me to come

I wonder, how certain people come in my life
I wonder, why'd I get in so many fights

Why I gotta live this life, hey hey

I wonder, how certain things don't go right
I wonder, why'd I get in so many fights

Why I gotta live this life, hey hey

Yo, it was June sixth '96, graduation night
Made it threw the school swish shootin' dice gettin' in fights
I even sparked a riot, 'til the school got quiet
And dismiss just got tired of usin' my fists

We had some shit like knife pipes bottles and sticks
Can't forget them 380's, nine's and 22's
Best believe, many dudes was paid in my crew
We made a name for ourselves boy I've seen some drama

Seems my momma never dreamed she'd go threw so much trauma
Comma, pause you ask about cops and laws
Well that shit don't exist when you black and poor
So we broke 'em, but at that night my heart got broken

Choken on the weed smoke drinkin' rum and gettin' open
Not to mention, never a big drinker I'm a thinker
But I'm thinkin' hey dis my night, pass me more liquor
Fight breaks out, I'm just too nice to get in it

But my brother got stabbed and I missed it
Word up, its crazy
Why I gotta live this life, hey hey

Tu nicht so auf Dealer, deine Schuhe sind von Fila
Wir leben auf einem Planeten voll Affen
Bewegen die Massen, die Mädels angaffen
Geschäfte laufen, Hunde verkaufen
Funkelnde Augen, 'ne Runde verschnaufen

Dann rappe vom Benz, man, fahre mit Mazda

Kapuze auf, Nacht's raus auf den Parkplatz - Schwarzmarkt startklar

Man gibt Alles doch erhält Nichts
Deshalb fick ich diesen Staat, bis er mich in 'ne Zelle schickt

Now he's leaning on my shoulder,

Buried in a nameless grave

Those that the beast is looking for

And thought his timeless soul had gone
In empty burning Hell-unholy one

Spewing from the mouth of hell

Hatfield and the North,"We're needing your love to guide us
If you just could, then we just would
Join in the mood of being
Halfway 'tween Heaven and Earth

If you feel like singing, sing it
If you just could, then we just would
Feel what the other's feeling
Even though we're far apart

Thanks for the colours you gave me
With them I can make a new start
Plan a new part for the future
A new resolution, gather my thoughts
Follow my heart, for here I am
Halfway 'tween Heaven and Earth, gently drifting
Caught in my dreams, supported by schemes
We wrote together, wondering whether
The words that were missing didn't belong
Or might have been wrong
But so long as we can, we'll
Follow moonbeams from afar
Touch the moon and chase the stars
Catch the sun and let it go
Find a way of saying so
Happy with you when we're
Halfway 'tween Heaven and Earth we'll remain
It's not like England, Holland or Spain!
What on Earth or what in Heaven's name
Is happening to me?
With you I want to be - I'll never leave you!

Halfway 'tween Heaven and Earth
Being with you's harmony
Sing a new song for the future

Hatfield and the North,"Tadpoles keep screaming in my ear
""Hey there! Rotter's Club!
Explain the meaning of this song and share it""

There's no way of understanding what's been going on
I lost track yesterday
Now I found out that it's generosity that turns me on
So let's keep it that way
Help yourself to me, I'll help myself to you
And all your friends - we can spread it around
So if you can spare it then come on and share it
Let's get on with it cause we're wasting our time 

Please do not take it seriously really, what a joke!
The only thing that matters is to share it

Crass displays of acute embarrassment would make you cringe
Spend your money elsewhere
I won't trouble you with all that cheap philosophy
It's better still to watch that on T.V.
Most especially adverts of some slinky hairspray
When the plastic actresses take off their clothes
Just to demonstrate all their curves and cleavages
And subtleties quite forgetting their hair

Please do not take it seriously really, what a joke!
The only thing to do is grin and bear it

Mirthless merriment, sickly sentiments so commonplace
It would bore you to tears
Give me non-stop laughter, dispel disaster
Or the Rotter's Club might well lop off your ears 

Laughing and drinking, dancing, grooving, stoned again
Falling over singing, hoping that you'll share it",Share It,1993
Hatfield and the North,"I'm vitamin-enriched

You'll want to slip me in your kitchen
How'd you like to mother me?
And I'll be tasty, Mr. Pastry, wouldn't that be lovely?
My mother once told me, ""eat what you are given""
Don't worry mum, I've realised what fun that could be
It makes a real man of me now, I think you'll agree
I've got more calories than brown bread in me now

Hatian Bros.,"Me odio por tanto quererte
Me castigas cuando estoy sin verte
Solamente de imaginarte
Yo me muero por acariciarte

Sentir tu boca besar la mía
Por eso a todo yo me amiesgaría
Estoy pensando de noche why día
Por tenerte todo lo daría

Te llevo en mi sangre, no puedo engañarme
Con cada latido te quiero más why más
Te ruego, te amo, te busco, te extraño
Sin ti ni un minuto yo quiero estar

No pensé que me enamoraría
Pero tus ojos fueron brujería
Me cumpliste una profecía
Why desbordaste un corazón que estaba en sequía

Me odio por tanto quererte
Me vuelvo loca si fuera a perderte
Why aunque este amor no lo cambiaría
Como yo te quiero a ti es una agonía

Te llevo en mi sangre, no puedo engañarme
Con cada latido te quiero más why más

Te ruego, te amo, te busco, te extraño
Sin ti ni un minuto yo quiero estar

Te ruego, te amo, te busco, te extraño
Sin ti ni un minuto yo quiero estar

Te ruego, te amo, te busco, te extraño
Sin ti ni un minuto yo quiero estar
Será que solo vivo pa' quererte
Me muero si no pudiera tenerte

Te llevo en mi sangre, no puedo engañarme
Con cada latído te quiero más why más

Bei Mädchen Nummer 1, der ersten,
War's am schwersten und ich fragte
Wie wär's denn? Gehst do mit zu mir fernsehen (oder so)
Meine Eltern sind in Ferien (yeah)
Das hatte vorher noch nie funktioniert
Ich war echt irritiert, um nicht zu sagen schockiert,
Denn sie meinte ""Klar! OK, fein!""
Was geht'n ab, ich war noch nie mit 'nem Mädchen allein,
Also heim und dann erstmal Bananenmilch light [???]
Kein Ahnung von gar nichts,
Ein Sparwitz, ohne Aktion lagen wir da,
So aktiv wie 'ne Rentnerpension auf Mallorca,
Doch da berührte ihr Haar meine Hand,
Die verschwand irgendwann unter ihr und dann
Passierte alles recht fix, war viel zu schnell vorbei,
Ich war 'ne Woche lang high, oder zwei oder drei,
Sie war das grösste für mich, die einzigste auf der Welt,
Doch in der vierten Woche hab ich dann festgestellt,
Dass sie mir gar nicht gefällt und die Beziehung echt ätzte,
So wurde Mädchen Nummer eins die letzte

You're my number one baby

You're my number one
Und ich glaube daran, dass es immer dauern kann!

Bei Weitem nicht einfach zu beschreiben,
Ohne auf Begebenheiten rum zureiten,
Die mich seit einiger Zeit begleiten.
(Denn zu) Zu aller erst, wir waren kein Vier-Wochen-Paar,
Es waren Monate, vielleicht auch ein Jahr,
Als alles klar war, wunderbar, war ich König meiner Welt
Und so, doch das wisst ihr ja!
Easy, wie Sonntagmorgen, keine Sorgen, kein Problem,
Souverän wie Superman, nur zu bequem,
Um zu verstehen, was passierte,
Unangenehm das ich nichts kapierte,
Ignorierte, was ich spürte,
(ah) bis sie mir diesen Typ präsentierte,
Von da an ging's mit mir bergab.
Hätte nie gedacht, was das aus mir macht!
Macht aus Kummer, die Nummer mit Mitleid und Frust,
Soviel Stil wie ein Wein mit Drehverschluss,
Bloss ich war mir sicher, es ist keine wie sie.
Mädchen Nummer eins, also keins oder die.

Refrain

OK, das hab ich jetzt davon,
Mädchen Nummer eins, die echte Number one,
Denn irgendwann ging mir das Jammern zu lang
Und ich fing wieder an (was?) mit meinen Jungs abzufahren,
Doch dann, auf einmal war sie da
Und ich war schon wieder dabei, high wie noch nie,
Ohne Scheiss, denn ich weiss, dieses Mal ist für immer,
Hatte keinen Schimmer, wie das abgehen kann mit einer Frau,
Mit der ich nächtelang nur geredet hab (blabla)
Bis sich irgendwas ergeben hat und das Leben hat's eben gut
Gemeint
Und nach Regen kommt eben Sonnenschein
Und ich glaube daran, daß es ewig dauern kann,
Lauf dauernd gegen die Wand meiner Vergangenheit an und
Ich weiss, mit dir's am besten, doch wenn es wieder nicht klappt,
Dann eben mit der nächsten

Fell into my arms

How did he not find the bogey, with his hand in my shoe? 
Way too close for me, ah well at least they allowed me through. 
Should be a good night in here, Ramo in the main room, 
People keep pushing me though, no reception on the phone. 
And i'm thinkin'... 
(Light are blinding my eyes) 
They said they'd be here they said, they said in the corner, 
And im thinkin'... 
(People pushin' by, and walkin' off into the night) 
These look well speckly, bit of green and blue, 
Freeze is well cheap though, so i'll take three if i need to. 
Right im on the plan, i wish the bouncers would go away, 
Borrow water off this man, here goes nothing OK, 
And i'm thinkin'... 
(Lights are blinding my eyes) 
Thats proper rank, that tastes like hairspray 
And i'm thinkin'... 
(People pushin' by, and walkin' off into the night) 
I hate coming to the entrance, just to get bars on my phone, 
You have no new messages, so why haven't they phoned? 
Menu, write message, so where are you and Simone? 
Send message, dans number, where've they gone? 
And im thinkin'... 
(Lights are blinding my eyes) 
Why's the message pending? where the fuck are ya? 
And i'm thinkin'... 
(People pushin' by, and walkin' off into the night) 
Hmm, brandy or beer? Waters a good idea, 
Wish that bar lady'd appear; and come serve over here. 
Where the fuck could they be? still not over in the corner, 
This nights a tragedy, i keep thinking i saw her. 
And i'm thinkin'... 
(Lights are blinding my eyes) 
No thats not them, thats not them either... 
And i'm thinkin'... 
(People pushin' by, and walkin' off into the night) 
I'm still not feeling anything, this has got to be a dud. 
It's been ages since i necked it, and smoked six tabs to the nub. 
Belly's not even tingling, i just feel a bit pissed.. 
No-one looks like minglin', i cant see her or him.. 
And im thinkin'... 
(Lights are blinding my eyes) 
I'm gonna do another i think. Yeah, one more, these are shit. 
And i'm thinkin'... 
(People pushin' by, and walkin' off into the night) 
These toilets are a piss take, queue's bigger than the door. 
Gotta get rid of this pill taste, what are they chattin so much for? 
Glad i'm not a girl in this place, they'll be here til dawn. 
Sure my belly's tingling a bit, somethings happening im sure. 
And im thinkin'... 
(Lights are blinding my eyes) 
Maybe i shouldnt have done the second one, i feel all fidgety and warm... 
(People pushin' by, and walkin' off into the night) 
Whoa, everything in the room is spinning, i think i'm going to fall down, 
My heart's beating to quick, i'm fucking tripping out. 
I wonder whether they got in, turned away no doubt. 
Who cares, this is a tune coming in, that who where hes like.. 
Im thinkin'... 
(Lights are blinding my eyes) 
My eyes are rolling back, i'm rubbing my thighs with my hand. 
And i'm thinkin'... 
(People pushin' by, and walkin' off into the night) 
Yeah yeah they cheer - can they see my hand in the air? 
Need to wave 'em over here. Swear Simone's kissing Dan. 
My head is twisted sever, body's rushing everywhere, 
They could have texted me when they were near, but i'm fucked and i don't care. 
(Lights are blinding my eyes) 
What was i thinkin' about? Ah who cares, i'm maaaashed. 
(People pushin' by, and walkin' off into the night) 
Totally fucked, cant hardly fuckin' stand.

She's telling me to slow down, I live a fast life
Funny thing is she wasn't saying that last night

I can't believe what we did last night
I'm gonna wake up in the morning sun
Roll over, telling everyone
I can't believe what we did last night
I wanna say oh my God that was so much fun
I'll never forget it, telling everyone about last night

What happens in Vegas, stays in Vegas
What happens in Miami, never happened

Never happened

Last night we were off the chain
You name it we did it, you loved it for sure
I can't remember her name, but her ass that I remember for sure
Convenient amnesia, remember the good, forget the bad
Remember the present, forget the past
She don't get down, then forget to ask her
One life, two worlds

Different night different city
Different girl but it's all the same
I party every night like my last
Be careful buddy you may run into my past
I don't got a conscience, and I don't got time to deal with the nonsense
I came to get off to everything
So alert all the bonds men

Some callin' me a winner

They had the drop on em, the slanted eyes peep the rocks on em
He kinda jig, and he bubblin big
Dig a hole holdin, so's watch his cash start foldin
And bet though, twenty G craps wet though
Nas you shoulda seen the nigga jet though
Had it on blast, shoulda seen me shakin all of my ass
Of course me, I threw the gas, thug nigga turnin real saucy
Firm lay low I'ma play if you say so
So stay close like I'm bout to twist babe bro
I laid it down, went a couple of rounds, and tried to flaunt him
I threw it on him, now he's right where I want him

[Verse Two: Havoc]
Got my mind in crooked ways
Saturated up in Alize, you ain't a threat nigga
So get big nigga baby girl crossin over send your soldiers
Toucha fuck a rusher, this world is colder
Like a, day in December 25th Son I got gift
From monkey, motherfuckers, that want to rip
Get your shit split, pushed back, grill that ass don't look back
Respect this, like a Lexus repo man I took that
Five cats to death dog, like shop I'm gonna set more
Handwritten obituaries vocal through my chords
Lights out... just pull the nines out
Let's find out, pointin shook ones, they pointin dimes out
It ain't hard, straight up and down, you get your deck pulled
My hand is full, of fake niggaz I position
Expensive intuition fuck a rap competition
Gat expo, get a grip and never let go
The tet blows, the rapper Noyd said, ""That ass is wet though""
Triple P, paranoid plus petrol
Scared to death, put the pedal to the metal
Ghetto connections, Audi 4, take your section
You only get once chance, ain't no second guessin
We blessin, peepin your style, them never testin
Lessons of life walk the night witcha weapon

The snake niggaz slither like Jake, ain't all great
Ain't no threat Dunn, fuckin with them niggaz that's fake
They got though, pushin a 850 auto, they sayin nada
They know The Firm gettin nachoes

Murderous mami, I threw the kiss, he was hist'

You'll be straight with his eight, and dead him on all his heron
Realistically, papi, is history, mami

I'm fuckin wit fours to cock this, let me plot this
Ice he nuttin nice, if he front, take his life
At the Shark Bar, fuckin wit Duke, him and his mans
Really frontin boo, got him the red velour Filas too
Here come my niggaz now in the black Hummer stuntin
Yeah that's The Firm, jig the fuck up and body sumpin
Whattup now Duke, his eyes cried from the inside
I seen all of his fears cause he about to fry
He looked at me, through his right eye, was like
""Mami why?"" I felt fucked up, I can't lie
He was shook, 'Mega opened his chest, ain't nuttin left
But the sky blue Land, and that niggaz last breath

Check my pinky ring medallion, it's a form gold penny 

I'm drug, put my foot in my victims in cold blood 

Life is cheap for you thugs when you give the dirt a hug 

You move slow, direct effect of sniffin snow 

La's song, home alone smokin wit a red bone 

That get's messy, Darkman blow spots like Joe Pesci 

In bars, wit twenty yards, ""Get out of jail free"" cards 

You can't fuck wit this Monopoly, knocker, dumb ?boka?

Now its V.S.O.P. in a G.S. that's mad smokey 
Murder tree's, Crusin gun in the stash so it won't poke me 
Up in the Marriot, Sweet dirty tint, Don't make no noise cause we dirty 
Tell the ho's to hurry in

And there's video taping of booming ass's on the zooming lens 
Rolling on you non descript niggas

Over the snare drum

Impregnating the track, making it fatter than it was 
Giving life to idea

See a close call about two clicks from my fortress 
We rolling squad deep, on the Kawasaki hourses 
QueensBridge got the drop on you niggas trying to toss us 
We metal down now its time to show these clowns who the boss is 
We live for the shit, Ain't trying to take no lossess 
Accumalating to much cream for you to touch 
Fucking welcome to my clutches, wipe the blood on off my chuckers 
From the ruckus 
Your gone and your crew still love us 
Can't call it, I'm in love with this good life shit 
I'm working with jewels, car, chicken clits, paying rent 
Murdered Presidents, running wild, stacking in piles

The block is mine cause I am a live criminal mastermind 
When I rhyme, I perfect this, niceness, I'm blessed with 
Exhale precise shine like cocian white 
Its the life of Pablo, Escobar niggas I know 
With diamond rolexes, that drive infinite's and lexus 
So send my enimies a message 
My Tommy Hilfiger vest, is bullet proof, so when niggas shoot 
I'm still protected 
So never ask why I write so violent 
My brain storm formed on a dorm in Rikers Island 
I remained calm while you tried to bite my style and

Planted ever so soft and gentle but die viciously
Hours of torture, before the torture apply misery
Days before I feel pity to give a guy liberty
Seen him, his pants shitty and eyes all glittery
I'll die a rich man before the FBI figure me
Forty stories up, inside a high rise in Italy
No hidden forces, only natural courses deliver me
Gray hairs from the great years, fears never shiver me
Reminscin', how we car-bombed ignitions
Of politicians, judges strong-armed to listen
Men turnin' up dead, or hurt harmed and missin'
Bulletproof cars are driven, Teflon edition
Bodies cut up in large chunks, thrown in car trunks
Music inside the bar stunk
Gettin' surrounded by bitches blowin' cigars drunk

Has been around since the days before prohibition (no doubt)
Mathematics was good then, the slow addition
Some overdosed down a coke slope, a dope addiction
Lookin' back on them days, I ran a whole division
Some of the Jake and the state was tryin' to throw the mission
They caught a ticket ride to hell with no admission; beyond these tracks

Curtains and drapes, got these Jakes tryin' to can me for real
Until then, be in the backyard with clam on the grill
Or catch me laid up in the canopy ill
With two mamis handin' me thrills; Vivica Fox body Vanity grills
Rubberbandin' these bills; tryin' to duck the fame and the glamor
Tryin' to stay from out the range of the scanners
Not tryin' to get my frame in the camera
Avoid tabloids and front pages
Bums get knocked off and bumped for favors
Collect Trump papers with pumps and gauges
Royale suites when I bunk in Vegas
Got homicide searchin' the city dump for neighbors
Pinky ring with a chunk of glacier
Copped a spot with a bunch of acres
Some of them got they bodies slumped for capers
Barcaleo hat, ducks and gators
Got a crib full of housemaids, butlers and waiters

Any map, I assist that, I'm holdin' it, all dead

What? Battle for cake and wizzes, we do it straight business
All mount ride, ain't no fake, reminisce, spit faces
Pissin' on the fake little swindler's list
Rae gave them cake, battle the gun, you're wildin'
I might levitatate well, I might take ya, push up, stylin' it
Oxes, reefers, police need us, the regime of Shaolin
With Queens re-up, with the poisonous hand
Remember y'all, no commercial, I hurt you, yo go get ya mans

All that money is us, now what's wit' us?
Eh yo all around hungry, that's us and can't get nothin' get it
Eh yo all that money, all them
All them shorties, everybody yell ""All lovely""
All that money is us, now what's wit' us?
Eh yo all around hungry, that's us and can't get nothin' get it
Eh yo all that money, all them
All them shorties, everybody yell ""All lovely""

Eh yo select me, Gucci sneaker recipe
Not the S dot Carters, no disrespect but respect me
One of the top five gangstas alive
My element is just the Elliott Ness, who hide
Yo I ran from some that was police
These heard about me bringin' marked money in I had the whole east
I've been the greatest, been flippin' the latest
Somethin' like the new haggler on the Ave

Ham it up, pullin' haze
And all the young niggas praise me
It's like the talent of the Six Million Dollar Man
'Yana pace, come on, banana squeeze
Aim at these Caravans, heard he had his man
And that ugly Keish' comin' from a galaxy of hood
Hard real people gettin' ki's
Wit' the media, it's all good

All that money is us, now what's wit' us?
Eh yo all around hungry, that's us and can't get nothin' get it
Eh yo all that money, all them
All them shorties, everybody yell ""All lovely""
All that money is us, now what's wit' us?

Everybody round me buying bottles
I don’t think that I could take another swallow
I be frontin but I think I’ve got a problem
Until I look it’s on myself I’ve been soft but never
Knowing I could do better, being an asshole’s easier
Ridin like I got some kind of control over media
But as long as I control my inner doors I’m safe
Saw my mom, she ain’t recognize her son’s face
Gotta get back on track and that’s that
Entitled to your own opinion but not your own facts
Gotta celebrate life, not words, just stacks
Of money you can’t take with you and it all go black

Do you really wanna know what’s on the other side of the door?

Damn, it’s already tomorrow
And she about to have a baby, precious cargo
13 but she started having problems
Now she send to the path and have it hard yo
Everything she get she fiend she beat and followed by the stress
Didn’t had nobody in school to tell her bout sex
No love at home, had to find it when she could
Looking for a father figure she givin up the goods
Pretty young thing with a self-esteem
Been gone down the drain and long by her dreams
Life turned around 1-80 degrees
Knocked up, she should be out there getting degrees
Boy it’s scary that she dropped out of highschool to carry
Fell apart, she won’t even know who the baby daddy
Kinda safe to say that she a Maury Povich
No playin now, mom she steady with poetry

Choppas on deck, case blocked off
Throwing up in the hood, have me paranoied
Life in the line of fire, cover the blazing of my voice
No fun when the party ain’t a party to you
Tryin to phase away and now the police stick the body to you
First 48 gotta keep your lips sealed
Next 48 part of the newest ville

Same mistakes, that’s madness, you end up back in those same slums
Day one, my eyes was on that prize that I sized up
Now I supposed to check, I supposed to check, I found that for the white fuck
Cold care, beauty pies, steaming all the way that jury lane
Bad fuck behind that mask, bitch might have that booty face
I earned this and I be down, before they told you I be there
I let you in, you bit the hand, nigga that’s downright treason
My eyes out for that mischief, fuck that, fill clips
To the top, real rap, know that I just build this
Sweat, blood and tears, my brother died was the only time I shed tears
Then switched gears, pulled out of here like last year
Now everything gets smoothed, like jasmine, chinchilla

Be prepared in case anybody fuck with the crew

Throwing hundreds around like money ain’t nothing to you
They be the ones that fall back, up in the cut and probably in all black
Mean motherfuckers and they all strapped, looking you, acting like you was all that
Acting like you untouchable ‘cause you tripping till they catch you slipping
And then what you thought you’d see?
Better be on top of your chip when you walking through the shots
Same demo when you walk through Queens
Shorty like I doubt that, I got things and I’m ‘bout that
This hood life what it look like, probably snatched up still ain’t felt that

Roam around with that fuckery and get stomped out with them steel toes
Mashed up on that sidewalk, can’t go against that current
Taking turns whipping that ass, we gonna give respect that’s earned
And to whom it may concern, got a problem, be my guest
We will play fair but you will ‘cause you’re not keeping no death around

You never take your day off, boy like the play off
Everybody frontin, you know that they’s gonna stay off
Motherfuckers thought they knew me, but nah they was laid off
Niggas tradin cars, yappin out the mouth
And could we talk about a life they ain’t move about
And wondered why niggas try to run up in they house
Gotta do the math on a bitch fore you get the stuff
Some of these hoes straight nut gags
And how you try to bend the crib butt ass
Shit be so real, I be dead as
24/7 yea, nigga I just break er less
Get money, give a fuck how a hater feel
My team give it up out here, straight yea
We took care of our own, they never popped off
Cop a ball motherfuckers, now the Glock off

[Chorus: x2]
Gotta do what you gotta do, I hear that
When things come back you better hear that
Niggas want they glock back, yea I hear that
Niggas dead on that, did you hear that?

I came back from runnin and can nobody change that feeling
People see you want chops, so many clapped feelings
Middle finger up to the sensitive
Go fuck yourself, dose of your own medicine
I’m on the cheddar bands, never was a settling for less
‘Cause anything less was just stress
Fuck distractions and the company you keep
We play for keeps, fuck you and your little beefs
Tryna grab that something your arms can’t reach
Could be of many other patients, me and my niggas feast
We don’t go hard, we beast
Hopefully you could leave in one piece
For the shit they did, niggas dig they own grave like it’s part of their belief
So I say rest in peace
You bitch ass niggas when you try to come at me

[Chorus: x2]

[Repeat x2]
Never gave a fuck how a nigga felt
Got my paper, big H, you know how I stay
Hustling shit, out the Xan I was fuckin dealt
And it’s all about the team, we don’t go for death

Blast 'em with the clapper, know I keep the ratchet on me
All that beefing shit is corny, nigga, faker than the Twitter beef
Your girl wants something realer so she's in my sheets
And I don't blame her, she rather be around this paper
Every move made is major, fuck a crib we buying acres
ODing off of life is where the high can take us
Sky's the limit, up above and way beyond you haters
I'm coming at your head better duck
Out from under bushes like, ""surprise, remember us?""

I only figured out a plan and switched it, life sucked
Felt like I was tortured
Every day we had to climb through the dirt
Hell if I forfeit
Been around the world and back again, nigga, check out the portrait
No more selling me short shit, my will so strong
For my soul, if you came across it, time to reclaim my fortune
Big fleet, line up the horses, gotta stay on my feet
Fuck running, down with the fortress, M-O-B 'til I sleep, nigga
South Jamaica is my drive, watch your fucking own back
That's what it takes to stay alive
If fiends wild, I've got the crystal shiny with me now
A thousand and more styles, mine's like a clip of rounds
Watch for the shifty smiles, just push the bar higher
Done lifted the crowd
Building on tilt, fill up this bitch with loud
A temper on me and that click-and-pow
Holding on to all these memories
I've got to think about them just to smile

So I took the long road
No music playin, just my dogs tappin around like Morse Code
No navigational compass
Everything I accomplished – did it on my own

How I make out a shit hole
To express to the world
You tell em what I saw and expose my flaws
In dirt you gonna get that back

From lying dormant, quiet as Mormons
To buying up foreign properties, been my ongoing prophecy

Fuck my trigger finger, the whole arm’s itching, I got the poison ivy
I won’t stop until your eyes go mahogany

I’m living by the honorable artistry code
I went about as far as modesty goes
And that’s good as gold, mind, body and soul
I’m outside of me watching my body
Embody god body till the inside of me
Thinks quicker than the outside of me

While lastly them niggas got locked and sent away
Gotta be a better way is what we said every day
Fucked up when your dreams all let away

And mold you bruck like the mell do
It get you to the point it make a real you

Once didn’t have a voice, now they hear you
Fuck being loved, better when they fear you

Bedrooms turn in more bedrooms,
We facing voodoo headwinds, quitting I did not blood through,
Blotch out here, drown and hit me

Hustlers hustling into fiends, fiending
The subway beat you there, just make sure that you know where you're going

How you feel about that it's not fiction or fact 
When I add or subtract comes back plus tax
Your minor setback leads to major combat
Improper contact leads to mortal combat
Hole in your starter hat and your skull gets cracked
Now I walked all on you like you're a doormat
Two hataz I break half squash why'all chit chat
If your patna is real he'll never turn his back
I know this for a format add needs to teachings
Mess with my stash and you gon be a quadrule preaching
You better believe it don't mess with my fade
Or you gon to feel the wrath of the H.A.W.K.

[Verse 1]
Hey here's a little story 'bout a nigga like me
I fuck bad broads live large and drive V's
Some say I'm cocky and rude I might be
But nigga fuck you, you ain't got to like me
I'm at the bar taking sips of long island ice tea
Wrist looking' blue or icy I'm pricey
Bitch niggas mean mugging' and starin' all shiesty
Don't make me pepper spray your face have you lookin' all spicy
Cause I know you niggas hatin' and want to fight me
Thinking I'm all Hollywood like Spike Lee
Thinking I'ma steal you and fuck up your white T
When I catch you in your jaw I'ma fuck up your white teeth
But nigga I be ready to scuffle like dice peat
And ya'll walkin' outta this tussle ain't likely
I hope you boys ready to rumble I'm quite deep
And I ain't friendly but I'ma tell you politely

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
Say I'm the type of cat  when I pull up in the place
you hatas like a blow job put it in they face
I buy the goochie shoes matching belt lookin' great
Dubs sounding cool you can tell I'm pushin' weights
Courtier full of flakes snow storms in the peaks
Hoe taming nigga keep my bitch on a leash
You the typa cat that'll chase a chick for weeks
Then try to box a nigga when you hear he hit your freak
But playa don't you know you outta line that shit is weak
And fightin' over broads will get you killed up in these streets
You running round here plexin' always thinking shit is sweet
Then have the nerve to wonder why them bullets hit ya cheek
Then want to step to me talkin' but (Oh you foul!)
All up in my face talking bout (You hit my gal)!
I'm looking at him stupid like man this shit is wild
You better give me space asshole I ain't ya pal

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
I keep my game on face when I'm riding on chops
Straight gorilla pimp don't even wave to the bops
Lookin' like a snail crawlin' slow through the lot
Fist full of grain other hand on the glock
Cause when you want fee jackers want what you got
That's why I stay ready with the inferred dot
The first one to jump is the first getting shot
Put the beam on his head then I take off his block
You love to rob O like take off you rocks
Take off your shoes playa take off your socks
But I'm the type of cat before I take off my watch
Aim at your chest and try to take off you heart
You know how I do playa shake off tha marks
Hit him with the big guns that take off a part
Chest lookin' like he been ate by a shark
Bitch you better mind stay in line play it smart

Young mommies want a hog that ain't cuffing the puttee

They want a jigga with figures sittin' swole with them goodies
So follow me now to the land of the brick lick hitters
Go getters and wig splitters and a little game that gives shivers
Playboy how you figure you can step to a hog

Let off a hundred rounds drums punishing you and yo dogs
My platoon issue wounds that don't heal up
Nigga when the Mack-9 reel up you better throw your shield up
We dope runners and cake runners 

All out big head hunters three glots and sixin it off the chain young stunners
Better slow down lil daddy before you fuck around and get pegged
Run you off like a scared dog with your tail between your legs 
want to be a baller when this G-shit go down
This my time when I clown that yo click out in one rhyme

Southpaw (southpaw) bone knuckles to the jaw
Above the law and all military forces

A hustler run the block like obstacle courses
I stand taller than Sasquatch
Rolex my wrist watch
And when the gloat cock it's strictly head shots

If a nigga got beef I knock out teeth
Steal you like a thief make the asswhippin' brief
Bring your family grief if the situation is getting sticky
My trigger fingers itchy cause my business is risky

You better not miss me (don't miss me)
Or you ass is history (Bye-bye!)
Yella tape the lot on an unsolved mystery
I can't deny pull more stunts than fog eye

But bullet shells left a trail from the M-16

I'm one of the ones (that's me)
That's an usual suspect
A thug that hang on an infested drug set
And stack chips, stay strap and pack clips

With hollow tips that will make you niggas do backflips
And If we go toe to toe I'll break your jaw
In three or four places like I break the law
Ghetto dope man yellow stone smokes man

Got killers and dealers on my team from here to Oakland
That's movin' more powder than Johnson and Johnson
I'm a death wish to niggas just like Charles Bronson
I'm uncut and lethal like LSD

Cocaine mixed with acid and PCP
Rap game assassin 
If I raise I blast and bury niggas six feet deep in the grass
So if anybody ask
Tell Chris Ward is dangerous

What kind of wheels is those brah

Man, I ain't never seen shining like that
Say H.A.W.K, what why'all use to do fool
When you was growing up

[H.A.W.K]
I use to sit and watch the Flinstones, Gucci rolls and herringbones
Bezel sets and baguettes, while talking on my cell phone
From Bo-Bo's to Air Macs, low cars to horse backs
Hoopties to Cadillacs, water guns to chrome gats
Levis to Guess jeans, black and white to big screens
Six by nine to 18's, Bumsalack to sipping lean
Regals with white walls, 20 inch with screens fall
Michael Jackson off the wall, to MJG and 8Ball
Screw house to wrecking flows, to BET on videos
Zig-zags and yellow bags, to Glad sacks and optimos
Fist fight to gun play, sawed-offs to a.k.'s
Spitting flows at talent shows, as the H-A-W-K
Riding on the Metros, pushing a six double O
Smoking cess to endo, fill it up with petro
Fixing on my lego, let go of my ego
Get in with my little bro, getting up when the rooster blow

[Lil Flip]
I remember Kangaroos and afro curls, always running after girls
Trying to sneak in Natural World, BB gun shooting at the squirrels
Candy red on tricycles, training wheels on bicycles
Sugar Daddy's, Pixie Stix, peppermints and side pickles
Loaded toes and Scooby Doo, some of the things we use to do
Roller skate now roller blades, Ivy Leagues to holding fades
Blow-Pop rings and diamond things, herringbones to bezeltines
Cadillacs to limousines, ironing jeans to being clean
GI Joes to Tonka toys, eating Willy Wonka boy
Riding in my uncle's car, wanting to become a star
Having dreams to be like Mike, hooping in my all black Nikes
Flying kites and shooting dice, sneaking in the movies twice
Staying up and watching Cops, walking outside in Michael socks
Being afraid of chicken pox, check my bowl on Magnavox
Running up and down my block, sweating cause the sun is hot
I use to ride the city bus, now I'm pulling Hummers out

[AP]
I remember brothers getting dumped off, in ditches and bayous
Boys gave head jobs, and all I saw was hairdo's
Pimps drove Lacs and dob hats, with chrome gats
Hustlers stack paper, with the players and macs
Police burns in the hood, because somebody just got jacked
Every girl I slam they call, I told em call me back
Haters got backhanded, because they were always talking smack
Instigators chit chat, and were known for spreading rumors
Ballers went from stabs, to buying more of consumers
I use to eat on tuna, now it's shrimp and caviar
I use to be a virgin, now I have menage tois
I use to drink on soda, now I'm sipping mixed with bar
I use to stay in the ghetto, now I'm a ghetto superstar
I recall when I couldn't rap, now my rap game's up to par
From then to now it's funny, Jabos to Armani
AP became a business man, that's all about his money

[Mista Madd]
Back in the days I was young, I'm not a kid anymore
But sometimes, I wish that I could be a kid again
I use to wear a swatch watch, now I only wear Movado
Went from bare foot on a bus, to holding keys to Monte Carlos
Now it's a big body Expedition, showing my naked ass provado
Went from hood to all good, shh playing a game like huh brah
Backyard nickel and dime that, now boys be moving birds
Use to carry my knife special, now it's gats and smoking sherm
Use to mix at house parties, freestyling to Whodini
Now I'm signing rappers to paid in full, eating shrimp and fetichini
Boy I use to ride big wheels, while wearing them Chuck Taylors
Now it's Jordans, Air Macs, even pink-green gators
Use to be sneaking in Lover's Land, or at the drive-in movies
Now it's Tinsel Town or Motel 6, where this hoe can do me
Use to watch freestyle the man, or Rap City on BET
Now I star in sitcoms, movies and got my own video show on t.v., what

[Redd]
Should of seen it I was right there, when a problem jumped off
Rounds got dumped off, leaving niggas bumped off
Always trying to get the hook up, leaving your girl shook up
Women breaking my pager, phone line you can't look up
We had ice on us, merchandise on us
Busting at other hoods, when they had a price on us
Listening to flow tapes, people saying rewind it
Pulling out my piece, and bystanders get blinded
From winter to summer time, there wasn't no leaving our block
When the laws made it hot, we was freezing our block
Man we got enough money, to make my neck look pretty
Cause we done made enough money, to make my check look pretty
Rapping at talent shows, saying phrase too frequent though
Niggas talk about Fasachi, we roll that in Regal though
Seein niggas Redd capping on, the comedy bout my chaperone
My dress code is casual, but all of a sudden I'm valuable

HAWK,"[Chorus - 2X]
I'm chilling with my broad, and you already know
And if you want to reach me, hit me on the down low
If I don't call back, don't put on a show
When I pass by your house and blow, instead of knocking on your do'

[H.A.W.K.]
You know that opposites attract, and hoes choose macs
And how some girls act, when playas don't call em back
Why is that, is it cause I'm hard to ignore
The kind of man you adore, but already spoken for
Or, are you caught up in the fame
Holding your head in shame, cause you don't know my real name
Who's to blame, cause it ain't my fault
It's another lesson taught, when you fucking with H.A.W.K.
Caught up in the rapture, wasn't hard to catch you
With my heavy weight frame and my 6-4 stature
I snatched you, whatever this game planned
Wanted me to be a man, but I had other plans
It was a one night stand, now the shit hit the fan
Everytime you see a nigga, you want to hold my hand
Girl you don't understand, that you not my type
I got a wife, and you're just my late night hype

[Chorus - 2X]

[H.A.W.K.]
Now I admit I was wrong, for leading you on
The long talks on the phone, you thought our bond was strong
But my woman's at home, so girl leave me alone
And all the plans you had for us, they been postponed
Now I ain't being rude, I'm just a type of dude
Buy you a little food, and get you into the mood
Now we're both in the nude, catching an attitude
Acting crude and shrude, and showing no gratitude
You broke all the rules, and I'm glad I peeped it
You couldn't be like Victoria, and keep this secret
You wasting your time, cause you star 69
but the cell phone I called you on, ain't even mine
It was strictly bump and grind, cause that's how I play
You said you didn't mind, so I behaved this way
It was just the other day, when you said this
And why you think I act funny, when you ask for a kiss
(you silly bitch)

[Chorus - 2X]

[H.A.W.K.]
Now you rubbing me, kissing and hugging me
Infatuated with the thug in me
You say you loving me, the situation's getting ug-ly
Got your partnas mean mugging me
Girl you bugging me, getting on my last nerve
And then you wonder why, you got kicked to the curb
You puzzled like crosswords, and asking me to choose
Either you or my wife, girl you know you'd lose
Now your ass got the blues, rich goody to-shoe
Sitting there all confused, feeling like you been used
Your privilege is world view, and now you know
Instead of knocking on your do, I'ma pass by and blow
Gotta go gotta go, gotta chill with my broad
So I toots my horn, since you been acting fraud
I hit you with the raw, and you went outrageous
Should of warned you though, that my love is contagious

Screwed Up Click, my click of G's
Ah you got to feel that player M-O-E
Rolling with the Los, running with the codeine
And we about break, so take all you can

[Hawk]
Screwed up, what, chest be looking booed up
With the chemistry it's brewed up tracks get chewed up
Brighten the mood up, when I'm spitting this all
Above the law, coldest nigga you ever saw
Stay there, outlaw hand me up the state
I infiltrate your chest stain and increase the death rate
Don't hate, my, it only makes us madder
Pockets get fatter, then a only makes them say matter
Squash all the chatter in the southern region
I pledge of allegiance to my niggas not breathing
We all still breathing screaming S.U.C.
And that's the story mafios, and P-A-T
Niggas can't see me cause I'm rougher than most
You boys are like bread not butter and toast
They can't even come close, they done already told ya
Like the H-A-W-K and a screwed up soldier

See when we floss our candy rides
Screens keep falling from the sky
Players ball and we stay true
And if you want to test my click
I pop problems what you get
S.U.C. and we god damn fools
We got that purple sticky dank
Chased with purple sticky drank
And forever we gone bang screw
Oh it's the Screw in us, we gone represent with pride
It's the Screw in us till we die

Devastating and motivating it's the S.U.C.
Showing and blowing up since the year 93'
Everybody be claiming the click, they want to be down
Wait to trip, on a flip through H-Town
Let's take it back, cause you know we love that
Poppi in the gray lay with the with the fifth on the back of the lac
You know we ride chrome everyday
Having the ghetto dreams like my nigga P-A
We crossed inside and forever we glide
And one thing's for sure man southside's riding
Let's get this cheddar, you got your wood and your leather
Sitting tall on boys pushing dubs or better
This a click full of g's, so we do it with these
Keep the block on pop and the ice on freeze
Mo yo, and Keke for real it don't stop
S.U.C. took a mission on down to Wreck shop, come on

HAWK,"[Z-Ro]
I'ma maintain, all about fortune, not the fame
Feddy, cold cash and a diamond ring, it's all about feddy when I
Rap sing
I'm sick of this struggling all damn day
Never see the sun cause skies stay gray
This for the little kids that can't go play
Cause everybody outside playing with an AK
Come around my niggas you bust you fuck around get lost
Better not set trip, fuck around get tossed 
I be a fool with that break them off 
Lay it down little daddy straight take them off
Yeah I'm living a sin when against the grain
You don't know Z-Ro you don't know my pain
Tears be coming on down like rain
It's a full time job, trying to maintain
Want to stay right but right be broke, a nigga can't eat with
Dreams and hopes
Steady be thinking of sell some dope, or trying to get paid from
Songs I wrote
In it to win it, don't plan to lose, got to be a real nigga fill
My shoes
Got to pay the rent, got to pay the light bill 
Got to pay the depend, deposit and pay dues
Me and that H-A-W-K, got to deal with stress when it come my way

But one of these days gone be out there
It's a bitch took a ball, ball and parlay
Until we make it we mash together
Ooint seven by the nine we blast together
South sive for live, S.U.C. for life, nigga we get cash forever

Keep maintaining, it's a burden up on my conscience just staying
Alive

I'm a real hustler stacking funds, riding around with a loaded
Gun

Some of my niggas that's on the run, with all that weed up in
Your lungs
Get your paper, get your dough, buy it off the show room floor
Go about this process slow, and feel the pain of my nigga Z-Ro
Over money I lose sleep, sell work, fuck sheep
Spit heat on beats, to make my, ends meet
Press hard on tablet sheets, everything else is obsolete
Victim of these ghetto streets, you don't work, you don't eat
I strive to, gain fame, struggle to maintain
Stay away from no names and flip bricks of cocaine
This rap thang's been good to me, feeds my, family
Forever keep my sanity, and do this shit for P-A-T
Must keep a leather head, for all my partners let's make em

Me and my niggas we break bread, until the whole family's fed
You heard what, I said, in this, over bull
All that, I say, I speak, the truth

Looking at this little light of mine, never did glimmer, never
Did shine
Cause I resort to a life of crime, and I know I'm wrong, but I
Got to get mine
Got to feed my mouth and five more, I grind every day but I stay
Broke
Responsibility baby, taking a load off my little day
Steady be working her fingers to the bone, aching and tired when
She come home
Bout to pull a stunt, last of the month
Ain't no more work, just riding on chrome 
No rocks in my pocket the on my neck
One slip and I'm tripping one growing up thick
Give me a couple of zeros on a check
I might sweat, but never gone let up

N****z betta see a n***a roll
Shorts down and I'm rollin' on 84's

Chorus (Fat Pat)
Swang-swang and I swang and I swang to the left
Pop-Pop my trunk yep, yep, yep, yep (x4)

Verse 1 (Trae)
I'ma swang I'm a swanger slab lean to the left
Pop my trunk and show what I'm about so Houston, Texas gotta be felt
I'm a vet so it's automatic when I be swingin' my wide frame
4-4's to 24's I'm subject to glide man
Like a pimp without the numbers still so fly when I slide man
Plus I'm lethal fully loaded ain't no takin' my ride man
We gangsta 
And it ain't too much you can do to stop us
Don't try to knock us 'cause these diamonds got boppas try'na jock us
We the best and what we gon' be and these haters know it
So haters hate us to death and I know 'cause these haters show it
I only ride alone so they can picture me rollin' 
And for them jackers thinkin' fly just picture what I be holdin'
Them hollow points'll make you picture just how fast they'll be foldin'
A few of them'll have you leakin' 'til you dead or you swollen
But still I ride like the law
Floatin' above everything
I'm Screwed Up Click until it's over n***a fresh off the chain
Beat the slang

Chorus (Fat Pat)

Verse 2 (Big Hawk)
I'ma swang and I swang and I swang to the left
Pop my trunk for Fat Pat's death
I would give my last breath if I could bring you back
Bring Screw back
Matter fact bring the whole crew back
Only God can do that so I'ma leave it alone
Movin' on
Groovin' to this soothin' song
I'm cruisin' along
Still got a Screw tape on
Still in the zone
Wishin' Cory Blunt was home
Ridin' on chrome
Bangin' with my bub lights on
Ridin' home
South east of the astrodome
I'm Fat Pat's clone
It's J go see Harry's own
His heartbeat pumps through my flesh and bone
Flippin' with Trae
Mobbin' down MLK
He's blue up with grey
On tint on southern deuce today
It's Dub K
Chiefin' on some lovely
And we on the boulevard actin' ugly
We gon'

Chorus (Fat Pat)

Verse 3 (Trae)
ABN is my type of nature my understanding is nothin'
Stacks in the back of a 'Lac on this glass you finna see me struttin'
Cuttin' corners on a daily basis
Move fast like Kanye West samples when I be chasin' faces
I'm known to tip like a waiter when I be leaned to the left
I brung the city through the dark with a fifth of boppers and belts
I'm ABN the Impala 67 Chevy be spinnin'
Invisible set displayed everytime they catchin' me grinnin'
Off in they face it ain't too much that they can do to a G
But try to hate me
Every second due to the fact who I be
And it don't bother me
'cause I still be toppin' my game
Just don't come off the side of my range I might be leavin' a stain
Whether my slab or beam 
N****z gon' respect that we gangsta
T-Shirt and Dickies plus the kicks that I lace up for you wankstas
Everyday is still the same
I be so loud when I bang
And thanks to Screw and P-A-T we got 'em diggin' our slang huh

Verse 4 (Pimp C)
I'm a Screwed Up affiliator strictly rollin' red
Every time we hit the parkin' lot we turn heads
I've been watched by parole, task force, and by the feds
'cause they know I got 'em for 10 and they know the game ain't dead
It's too late
I'm deep up in it ain't nuthin' about me scary
Chiefin' in the club try'na find me somethin' hairy
Dippin' at the bar 
Smokin' on the stokey
Since I came home from the pen seems like everybody know me
You got lots of friends when you up and when you ballin'
Just like Pookey all the haters started callin'
They see the diamonds and the Bentley and the candy thing
They know I'm mob stompin' Texas they know that I'm rollin' with Jane
They know it's UGK for life and that I'm down with Bun
They know we grindin' bitch'll hitcha with another one
It's UGK records right now we need distribution
Since Laura Rebel free the pimp is goin' down in Houston

HAWK,"My life
My life, really feelin hard times

Lookin' out my window, holdin' my weapon like Malcolm X and
And it seems I'm over-stressin', feelin' like hatin' is your profession
And I know a couple Texans that got killed for over-reppin'
So I never be oversteppin' boundaries bounded to my weapon
When they ask me how I'm doin, I just tell 'em ""I'm doin' super""
I got a date with Destiny, allow me to introduce ya
Her little sister Fate told me I'm gon' be the future
And legacy's everything to a Martin Luther King Koopa
This recession is so pathetic, got me feelin' like I'm athletic
And success tryna get away from me and I ain't tryna let it
When they told that Pimp was gone, my reply was ""I don't get it""
And I'm still havin trouble believin' it happened the way they said it
Had to cut some partners off, swear to y'all it ain't my fault
I've been grown since I was seven and I was born to be a boss
But I know there's a bunch of haters tryna see me take a loss
So I be sleepin' with one eye open and put cameras in my vault
I've been thinkin' and gettin' deep and they tryna tell I been preachin'
But I know that they can't see how much of the world that I be reachin'
So stop reachin, stop leachin, I'm a fade 'em out like bleach and
In the spots where they can't get out to is the spots I visit frequent
Europe to UK and Germany, travellin' currently
Made so much in millions that I could cash out in eternity
Accustomed to hittin' customs with that duffle full of currency
When God created hustle, looked at the world and he inserted me, Koopa

[Chorus: x4]
I'm just livin' my life, so cold
In the streets so I'm takin' it slow

Uh, yeah
I'll tell you my story, I only speak the truth homie

It a terrible situation, throwed on the curb within the hands of time
But since I'm blistery breathing I guess a nigga livin' fine
I live a life that's filled with dramatistic people cryin'
And since the hood depend on me, they'll never lose a hand of mine (I gotcha)
I'm paralysis when it come to the good times, I'm used to the pain
Feelin' like a bum under the bridge, I'm so used to the rain
Anything I do is from the heart so it reflect my name
Forgive me for my sins father, I feel like I'm goin' insane
Media criticizing me for checking niggas, fuck it, oh well
I just wasn't raised a little pussy disrespected nigga
I'm tryna live on my own by the ways of a gangster
So every time I leave out I pray so I'm prayin' for a gangster
It's bad enough the world we livin in all about money
Since we runnin' out I choose to believe it ain't nothin funny
I've been stabbed in my back so much I deal with it
I'm tryna kick it with my life before heaven come chill with it

[Chorus: x4]

Last year was a hard one but life goes on
Thinkin' bout my nigga Pimp while I write this song
And the list goes on, all my niggas is gone
I'm tired of hearin' bad news, scared to pick up my phone
Got a call, my nigga Eddy died from Acres home
Just seen him at my video shoot, now that shit wrong
Kelvo, Arborea, even my girl Shantz
I just heard word she got stabbed to death today
Dear Lord, I pray that you take away the pain
From their family and their friends, please help us change
Still warm my niggas sleep dog, stessle and stank
My girl Dee Dee, they got me pourin' out my drank
It's fucked up, all my friends is dead or in the pen
Seem like soon as your life begin it's beginning to end
I'm frustrated, but you gotta smile, your time is dated
You never know when showin' your love might be related, ha ha

You went down to 99, you not a percent artificial
Playa hating me detrimental, better watch what you say
This dream team bout green, BB King on my two way
Telling me, E.S.G. let me do a story on your life
To show the world how you emerge, to splurge your ice

Fat checks we cash em, shut em down to mash em, huh

[Chorus]
[Slim Thug]
Watch out, here come them hogs, in them big L dogs
You want to see somebody ball, follow us to the mall
I need my money tall, when I talk I walk
It's Slim Thug, E.S.G., and my dog Big H.A.W.K.
Living laid in the shade, all dues been paid
To tell the truth we got it made, something hatas can't fade
Riding thick like a parade, shutting all blocks down
Bout to show the whole world, how that H-Town clown

[H.A.W.K.]
Make way, for the H-A-W-K
You can bet your last dolla, I got something to say
I'm not caring like Donna, with mo' hits than Madonna
I got niggas out here, trying peep my persona
Ask your baby mama, bout Slim and E
She got fucked by them, then got fucked by me

O's for off the chain, when we swang we turn heads
The double S is for the Southside, on my SS Impala
Ah fuck it, this year it's staying stacking dollas
Saranada enemies, g's in my vicinity
The H is for you hoes, with homosexual tendencies
The O's for ounce of do-do, and optimo nigga
The double G for ghetto gold, getting green and go-getter

[Slim Thug]
Some hard hitters bout our figgas, out that Texas nigga
We pull triggas on fake niggas, bullshittas and quittas
We shut em down, top bound, turning smiles to frowns
Going round for round, from each town to town
The new pitcher on the mound, is the Mr. Slim Thug
The young boss out the North, that sell like drugs
Show me love, cause this year Boss Hogg gon shine
We on a million dolla grind in our times, watch out

Peep the message I send
Take these levels that you devils can't comprehend

Big blue lens, now whatcha' talkin' about?
Close yo' mouth, as I settle all scores
Scream and shout, my similes and metaphors
Mansion doors, I constantly close

Screwed Up Click, my click of G's
Ah you got to feel that player M-O-E
Rolling with the Los, running with the codeine
And we about break, so take all you can

[Hawk]
Screwed up, what, chest be looking booed up
With the chemistry it's brewed up tracks get chewed up
Brighten the mood up, when I'm spitting this all
Above the law, coldest nigga you ever saw
Stay there, outlaw hand me up the state
I infiltrate your chest stain and increase the death rate
Don't hate, my, it only makes us madder
Pockets get fatter, then a only makes them say matter
Squash all the chatter in the southern region
I pledge of allegiance to my niggas not breathing
We all still breathing screaming S.U.C.
And that's the story mafios, and P-A-T
Niggas can't see me cause I'm rougher than most
You boys are like bread not butter and toast
They can't even come close, they done already told ya
Like the H-A-W-K and a screwed up soldier

See when we floss our candy rides
Screens keep falling from the sky
Players ball and we stay true
And if you want to test my click
I pop problems what you get

We got that purple sticky dank
Chased with purple sticky drank
And forever we gone bang screw
Oh it's the Screw in us, we gone represent with pride
It's the Screw in us till we die

Devastating and motivating it's the S.U.C.
Showing and blowing up since the year 93'
Everybody be claiming the click, they want to be down
Wait to trip, on a flip through H-Town
Let's take it back, cause you know we love that
Poppi in the gray lay with the with the fifth on the back of the lac
You know we ride chrome everyday
Having the ghetto dreams like my nigga P-A
We crossed inside and forever we glide
And one thing's for sure man southside's riding
Let's get this cheddar, you got your wood and your leather
Sitting tall on boys pushing dubs or better
This a click full of g's, so we do it with these
Keep the block on pop and the ice on freeze
Mo yo, and Keke for real it don't stop
S.U.C. took a mission on down to Wreck shop, come on

And I want to say to you, without you fool",S.U.C.,2002
