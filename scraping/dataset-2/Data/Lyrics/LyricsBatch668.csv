Apostles,"APOSTLES

Look at all my trials and tribulations
Sinking in a gentle pool of wine.
Don't disturb me now, I can see the answers
'Till this evening is this morning, life is fine.
Always hoped that I'd be an apostle.
Knew that I would make it if I tried.
Then when we retire, we can write the Gospels,
So they'll still talk about us when we've died.

JESUS

The end...is just a little harder, when brought about by friends.
For all you care, this wine could be my blood.
For all you care, this bread could be my body.
The end! This is my blood you drink.
This is my body you eat.
If you would remember me when you eat and drink.
I must be mad thinking I'll be remembered.
Yes, I must be out of my head.
Look at your blank faces. My name will mean nothing
Ten minutes after I'm dead.
One of you denies me.
One of you betrays me.

APOSTLES

No! Who would?! Impossible!

JESUS

Peter will deny my in just a few hours.
Three times will deny me,
And that's not all I see.
One of you here dining,
One of my twelve chosen
Will leave to betray me.

JUDAS

Cut the dramatics!
You know very well who.

JESUS

Why don't you go do it?

JUDAS

You want me to do it!

JESUS

Hurry, they are waiting.

JUDAS

If you knew why I do it

JESUS

I don't care why you do it!

JUDAS

To think I admired you.
Well now I despise you.

JESUS

You liar. You Judas.

JUDAS

You want me to do it!
What if I just stayed here
And ruined your ambition.
Christ you deserve it.

JESUS

Hurry, you fool. Hurry and go.
Save me your speeches,
I don't want to know. Go!

APOSTLES

Look at all my trials and tribulations
Sinking in a gentle pool of wine.
What's that in the bread? It's gone to my head,
'Till this morning is this evening, life is fine.
Always hoped that I'd be an apostle.
Knew that I would make it if I tried.
Then when we retire, we can write the Gospels,
So they'll all talk about us when we've died.

JUDAS

You sad, pathetic man, see where you've brought us to,
Our ideals die around us and all because of you.
But the saddest cut of all:
Someone has to turn you in.
Like a common criminal, like a wounded animal.
A jaded mandarin,
A jaded mandarin,
Like a jaded, faded, faded, jaded, jaded mandarin.

JESUS

Get out they're waiting! Get out!
They're waiting, Oh, they are waiting for you!

JUDAS

Every time I look at you I don't understand
Why you let the things you did get so out of hand.
You'd have managed better if you had it planned...
Oh....

APOSTLES

Always hoped that I'd be an apostle.

JESUS

Will no one stay awake with me?
Peter, John, James?
Will none of you wait with me?

Apparat,"Down in the blinding light
It's getting cold
I've been worn out by the night
But I can't let go

The sounds in my ears explain
I've been here too long
A freedom hard to maintain
I should be gone

Long have I waited here
For nothing to come
A sequence of twisted turns
That can't be undone

They're paying your rent, 
They're feeding your kids
But it's taking much more
Than pleasing your needs

Saw the water rising, 
On a beautiful day
A flood only washing the ones away
Who were lying in the sun

And you're still where you begun

Apparat,"The street is rushing beneath
This is the fastest way I know
Where all the cars move backwards
And giant alley trees were grown again

I cut across the city's backyards
Counting cracks in the concrete
A burst open spider web
And every blade of grass will make me sneer

When all the fields dried up
Tens of comfortable years ago
I made this journey once before
And the city fed me long enough

To put on weight around the middle
This is apparent affluence
Lived in a pack when I was little
Then I got pulled apart from closest friends

There was a door on my horizon
And silver sparkling rays were pouring in
So I sneaked away on soft hands
Another world in the making

Now I know how you felt
Now I know how you felt",Escape,2011

Losing voices for the day
For the better and the bright
For a way out, of the night

I just want to slide across
I am trying to get lost
I just want to hear you talk
One more time before we stop

Losing our voices, losing our voices for that day
Losing our voices, losing our voices for that day

Trees and houses stray
Dead legs turning silver grey
All that happened yesterday
Sunlight washes it away

Where I go I'll go alone
I'll be safe 'cause this is home
Take the fast lane out of here
To escape; to, disappear

The doctor told her that she could not conceive and
She's miscarried 6 times upon Stephen
That's her husband's name and he's from Cleveland

Prayed together, cried together, held one another
But something said to him that she's still gon' be a mother
He remembered what the doctor said and he said, ""So what""

Your opinion does matter
It's gonna help me to unwind

When you walk on by
With your head held high
It's the wonder you've ever seen me cry

At the end of the day
With no words left to say
Just stop and say hello

(Can't you see me hiding)
From these tears of mine?
Don't pretend that you can't see me

(As far as you're concerned)
I'm doing fine
How do you get up so easily?

Why is it such a problem
To recognize that I'm here?

Just give me a minute or two
It would mean so much, my dear

I've got a question
Was it you or was it me?

It seemed you not bothered
Should I move on electric beat

When nothing ever seems to go your way
And no matter how hard you try,
You couldn't chase the blues away.

Remember when you told me there'd be days,
When all the skies would turn to gray.
You said you'd always be there for me all the way

I didn't think I needed you to help me through,
Didn't have a clue
I never took one step alone,
But now I know you'd do what only you can do.

All I need is to see you smile.
Don't got to read between the lines cause you're real with me, you're real with me.

I know it's gonna be okay.
'Cause I know you're gonna always stay, stay real with me

I know I can always count on you, whenever I need to hear the truth.
'Cause even if it hurts, you say the words you need to say.
Now that I know what you do for me, I don't know how to say how much it means.
That you don't want no pay, you're being my friend unconditionally.

You gave me all that you could give, show me how to love, how to live.
And though you tell me its okay, I don't have to say,
I wanna thank you anyway.

Don't tell lies, they're hard to handle

Some words don't come easy
Some don't come at all
I don't think I'll be talking when you leave

Late last night I thought I heard you crying
I guess you had some trouble in your sleep
And the only sound I can rely on
Is the song you're singing when you leave

Some don't come at all
I don't think I'll be talking when you leave

Tes baisers n'ont pas encore le goût de l'adieu
Et si c'est vrai préfère encore fermer les yeux
Oh oh oh oui, si tu mens

Tout ce qu'ils me disent ne me touche pas
Quand je suis dans tes bras, oh yeah
Je crois ce que tu m'dis quand
Tu me fais les yeux doux

Ils disent que tu joue avec mon coeur
Et que bientôt tu partiras ailleurs
Mais pour le moment je n'ai aucune envie
De te demander si tu m'a mentis
Oh oh oh oui, si tu voulais

Tout ce qu'ils me disent ne me touche pas
Quand je suis dans tes bras, oh yeah
Je crois ce que tu m'dis quand
Tu me fais les yeux doux

Non je ne veux pas les écouter
Même si bientôt je dois regretter
Mais pour le moment moi je veux profiter
De cet amour et ne pas me demander
Oh oh oh oui, si tu mens

Oh oui, regardes toi
Si tu mens, regardes toi
Si tu mens, si tu mens
Oh oui, oh no no no no

April March,"The girls in their knee socks
They all got it made
Just walking and whistling
In the sun, in the shade
They haven't been shown yet
How love can behave
They're happy-go-lucky
Like bears in a cave

The boats in the harbor
They're never alone

The sea licks them all day
And makes them her own
They don't think of salt rot
Or even decay
They bob in the rough tide

And down by the shore an orchestra's playing
And even the palms seem to be swaying
When they begin the beguine

To live it again is past all endeavor
Except when that tune clutches my heart
And there we are, swearing to love forever
And promising never, never to part

What moments divine, what rapture serene
Till clouds came along to disperse the joys we had tasted
And now when I hear people curse the chance that was wasted
I know but too well what they mean

So don't let them begin the beguine
Let the love that was once a fire remain an ember
Let it sleep like the dead desire I only remember
When they begin the beguine

Oh yes, let them begin the beguine, please make them play
Till the stars that were there before return above you
Till you whisper to me once more, ""Darling, I love you""
Then we suddenly know what heaven we're in

Haunts my reverie

Not so long ago, when I was just a child

And how much you meant to me
How much you meant to me
And I don't think I've ever told you so
And I thought you'd like to know
That now I see and I can understand

I was unkind, I must have been blind to your sorrow
And night after night, trying to live with your sorrow
And I was a bastard and I was wrong
And I was lost in things I've done
And I was stealing just for fun
And it was breaking your heart

Come on, let's run, it's time for some fun
Can't you see, now it's come over me, since I met you
Don't hold it inside, we got nothin' to hide

Ooh tonight, come on and make it alright
It's right if you say that it's so
So come on and let yourself go

Reach for the sky, you know I might if I try
But all I want is just to be alone, and to hold you, ooh
Now what do you say, won't you see it my way

Ooh tonight, come on and make it alright
It's right if you say that it's so
So come on and let yourself go..............

Ride in my car, you can play my guitar
Or you could give it away, until the heartache starts to get to ya, ooh

But the way you do it, I knew it was gonna work out this way
It's beyond the point of pleasure, to the point of no return

I've made my mind up, I've had enough, I'm through with you

I work so hard just to get along
Before I know it, all the money's gone
I do my best just to make headway
And save some money for a rainy day

If money can talk, let's talk
If money can talk, we should talk, talk about it

Before I know it all the money's spent

Cookin' up and turnin' grooves

Blood money, but still you make your demands
Blood money, you can't get any colder
Blood money, but still you're thinkin' it over

You don't have to be smart, it don't take any heart, least of all, shame
Some turret stunt, open in the front, your motive is plain
And for those that contend, with the choice to condemn, I know that you care
For those left alone, when it's time to go home, and nobody's there

I said oh no (no no no no), you're completely insane
I said oh no (no no no no no), you'd take a life for material gain
Blood money, you got blood on your hands
Blood money, but still you make your demands
Blood money, you can't get any colder
Blood money, but still you're thinkin' it over

When you're out on the street, and you got nothin' to eat, it's easy to see
That you do what you can, still I don't understand, how wrong you can be
Though it's all very clear, that you bargain with fear, there's no justice at all
It's easy for some, they say the bigger they come, the harder they fall

I said oh no (no no no no), you're completely insane
I said oh no (no no no no), you'd take a life for material gain
Blood money, you got blood on your hands
Blood money, but still you make your demands

They call it the burnout factor, and only the good die young
Somebody's gonna take their life, just tryin' to have some fun
The paper's gonna say we're crazy, no matter what they say, yeah
You know I'm gonna rock all night, gonna rock all night and day

Whenever they quote you man, you'll be misunderstood
They're never gonna get it right, or tell it the way they should
Maybe we move too fast to put it all in a song
And if we keep pushin' ourselves we won't be around too long
If you wanna try it

Crash and burn, crash and burn
Crash and burn, crash and burn all night long

Some people like to take it easy and flow without a sound
Others like to play for keeps and spread themselves around
I don't wanna say it's right, but if that's where you wanna be
Life's too short to miss out on what you wanna see
If you wanna try it

Crash and burn, crash and burn
Crash and burn, crash and burn all night long

Come on now, honey, don't tell me the way I ought to be
You know I don't need nobody talkin' back to me
Hey, I'm gonna live my life the way I think I should
You know I wouldn't change a thing, even if I could
I tell it like it is

And the way she looked at me, drivin' me wild
She was dressed to kill in her five inch heels, her painted on satin pants
She had the look of need, like, give it to me, I dedided I should take a chance

If you see kay, tell her I want her
If you see kay, tell her I need her
If you see kay, tell her I want her now

Her legs were long shapely, I could see her love was hot
And when it came together, she'd give you all she's got
She had the walk of a woman on fire, her eyes undressed my mind and soul
I woulda gladly bet my last ten buck, in love she'd lose control

If you see kay, tell her I want her
If you see kay, tell her I need her
If you see kay, tell her I want her now

I had her in my dreams, three times every night
Her love was so complete, her love was warm and right
When I wake up in the morning, with this achin' in my heart
You can bet the need I'm feelin', is only just a start
I felt the pressure risin', when I looked where she had been
By the time I gave up hope, she'd probably fall in love again

A first offender, you had your chance, and you threw it away
So why don't you just get on your pony
And ride out somewhere where you can be lonely
All by yourself, instead of tellin' me

Here we are, and we never get very far
Things are never as you say they are
And you'd rather be somewhere else in time
Anywhere, well you don't mind

The legal tender was the motive for your shame
You knew the truth, but never took the blame, you knew it was wrong
But never one to open your heart
You held it inside till it tore you apart
And you couldn't go on, and now you're tellin' me

Broken hearts don't always mend
Left too unsure to try love again

Just between you and me
Baby I know our love will be
Just between you and me
Always I know our love will be
Just between you and me

Lovers often seem to say
Hearts can be blind to love gone astray
Always it's the same old song
Someone's been hurt by a love that's gone wrong

Just between you and me
Baby I know our love will be
Just between you and me
Always I know our love will be
Just between you,
Just between you and me

Words are sometimes hard to find
The silence can be so unkind
You always help me find my way
The love that we share grows stronger each day

Just between you and me
Baby I know our love will be
Just between you and me
Always I know our love will be
Seulement entre toi et moi
Means that our love will always be
Just between you and me
Baby I know our love will be
Just between you,
Just between you and me

So many times I've loved you
And now I don't even know you
I'm just a victim for your love
And having my whole world fall down
And finding the strength to go on
Cause I'm just a victim for your love
And I'm not the one you're thinkin' of
I'm just a victim for your love

I thought our love was growin' strong
Growing each day, well I was wrong
Then having my whole world fall down
And finding the strength to go on
Cause I'm just a victim for your love
And I'm not the one you're thinkin' of
I'm just a victim for your love
And I'm not the one you're thinkin' of, no

I'm just a man with a broken heart, oh no
I'm just a man with no place to start, oh yeah
I was a victim for your love

Don't break my heart, don't cause me pain
Comfort me love, hold back the rain, oh no
I'm just a man with a broken heart, oh no
I'm just a man with no place to start, oh yeah

You come around, and now I'm warm
I thought that I was havin' fun
And now I see the way it's done
I thought we'd led a life before
And who we were, well I'm not sure
But one thing I know is right
I loved you then
I'm gonna love you tonight

I'm on fire for you baby
Fire for you woman, all night
I'm on fire for you baby
Fire for you woman, all night

So don't take your time, it's gettin' late
We might lose if we hesitate
'Cause bein' free is lots of fun
For me, though I'm just twenty one
I got things to do, and things to see
Might even have to leave you be
But till that time, let's give our all
And don't look back, until we fall

I'm on fire for you baby
Fire for you woman, all night
I'm on fire for you baby
Fire for you woman, all night

It'd be a shame, if our games, were doin' us
With all the time spent on tryin'
Then to lose your lovin'

So come on girl, we'll raise the sky
We'll break on through, we'll get so high
And don't worry about tomorrow's world

Apulanta,"Eternity is every heartbeat crawling over me
Silence is too loud, it's like a thunder in my ears
Curl up lie down close your eyes, wait for the hit to come
All quiet on the western front

Trade all my love for one dive in the light
After all these burns I welcome the night
Come, drift away now with me
Trading myself for nothing

It's so easy to lose yourself in the empty eyes
Cover up your face, don't meet the crowd with no disguise
In the end there is no right, just variants of wrong
I'm still waiting for the cavalry

Trade all my love for one dive in the light
After all these burns I welcome the night
Come, drift away now with me
Trading myself for nothing

Aqua,"Howdy people? 
Here's a little story about an old friend of mine 
And to all you great folks out there 
This is hardcore 10-4 

Freaky Friday, things ain't going my way 
Everything is gone, my life is a country song 
Oh oh, 

I jumped out of my bed this morning 
Then I heard this crunchy sound 
From my left leg that was broken 
And a note was laying on the ground 

Baby, I'm leaving you this minute 
Took the car and the cats and dogs 
Got the boots and the rhinestone stetson 
Nothing's left but the note you got, ah you suck 

[Chorus]
Freaky Friday, things ain't going my way 
Everything is gone, my life is a country song 
Freaky Friday, go play on the highway 
Everything is wrong, what the heck is going on 

On my way through crosstown traffic 
I was hit by a giant truck 
I came late to work and got fired 
Then suddenly the thunder struck 
Oh oh 

Baby, I am leaving you this minute 
Took the car and the cats and dogs 
Got the boots and the rhinestone stetson 
Nothing's left but the note you got, ah you suck 

[Chorus]

Life's a country song, hardcore 10-4 
What the heck is wrong, yi-ha 
Life's a country song, hardcore 10-4 
What the heck is going on 

Life's a country song, hardcore 10-4

What the heck is going on 

Everything is gone, my life is a country song

Your inevitable love song
Inevitable lie song
Inevitable cry song

A moment of sun in her eye
And everything was quiet

In the garden of love I saw
Starlight sigh and shadow move
Faltering, no faltering, faltering

Before you go
A few words for your heart
Before you turn
Something to ponder in your heart as you go

In our garden of love we grew
Roses so red our hearts were busted open
All feeding on the dream we made
The bright and beautiful parade
That bloom by bloom began to fade
And blow by blow, oh

Before you go
A few words for your heart
Before you turn
Something to ponder in your heart as you go

How we tried to make everything right
How we fought and we talked through the night
How we nearly, we made it

In the garden of love I saw
A moment of sun in her eye
And everything was quiet

Stepping out into the light other side of the window
Blinking and blind in the light other side of the window
Falter, no faltering now, other side of the window
Falter, no faltering now, that journey is over, over

There's only so much that our heart can grow
Then everything else starts to overflow
But you're young and in love
Back then there was no way of knowing

So we pushed and we pulled with our nerves of steel
You had the pedals and I had the wheel
And the terrible truth
Is we never knew where we were going

Smiling hand in hand, this wasn't what we planned

Thought the night has fallen
I close my eyes and imagine
A tiny glimmer flickering on the horizon

It takes time to get it right
Takes no time to get it wrong
I can't believe I didn't see
The ground was caving in, oh, can we just start again?

Thought the night has fallen

A tiny glimmer flickering on the horizon

Everyday, everyday, living my life like it's over
Like it's over and deep underground
Little look, little smile, flick the switch and it's over
Like it's lost and can never be found

But maybe there's a tiny glow
That won't die and won't leave us alone
Star shining, the sun is rising, ooh, ooh

Ara Ketu,"Basta uma brisa da praia
Pra gente ficar
Com vontade de amar
Um vento ousado na saia
Revela o desejo
Guardado no olhar

Basta uma noite de lua
Pra gente ficar
Na maré da paixão
E quando a pele está nua
A gente descobre
Que a vida é um tesão

Quando você quer eu quero
É febre no corpo
Um eterno verão
Um sentimento sincero
Quem vive no amor
Só tem uma estação

Vou me entregar aos desejos
Pedindo pro tempo
Parar de passar
Vou me perder nos teus beijos
Deixando a vontade
Do corpo mandar

Que a gente se ama (tá, tá, tá na cara)

Que a gente se adora (tá, tá, tá na cara)

É mais, é tara (tá, tá, tá na cara)

Que a gente se quer (tá, tá, tá na cara)

Que a gente se gosta (tá, tá, tá na cara)

Não para jamais, não sara

Se entregar outra vez
E não importa onde esteja

Que ainda não fez

She had long black hair, green eyes.

We seemed to get on well on the way, considering the age gap. 
She was nineteen and I was almost fifteen.

She stopped by the river, And asked me to go swimming. 
I was a bit embarrased. I said no. 
But she said she would anyway, stepped back, and stripped. 
The sun was beginning to set, as she slipped into the water. 
And when she was in she kept teasing me, so I gave in. 
But I kept my pants on. The water was warmer than I'd expected. 
We swam around and played. She would push me under the water. 
I could feel her legs against mine underneath. 
She'd hold my arm. We must've been in about an hour.

I got out first. 
I leaned against a tree and put my trousers back on 
And then she got out of the river and walked towards me. 
She put her hands on the tree above my head and 
Pushed herself against me, and leaned down and kissed me. 
I don't know how long it lasted. 
then she stepped back and bundled up her clothes and said 
""I'm sure you can find your own way from here"".

But park here now and I will promise, I will let your engine cool. 
I have matured, I've come of age, my visions clear.

Arab Strap,"So that was the first big weekend of the summer... Starts Thursday as usual with a canteen quiz and again no-one wins the big cash prize. Later I do my sound bloke routine by approaching Gina's new boyfriend to say that he shouldn't feel that there's any animosity between us and then I even go and make peace with her. I shouldn't have bothered. Then on Friday night we went through to the Arches...

There was only one car going, so some of us had to get the train. We got through quite late. Then we went to a pub to take the gear. There was no problems getting in - we saw some others waiting down the front of the queue so we skipped in. It was a good night, everyone was nutted and I ended up dancing with some blonde girl. I thought she had been quite pretty until last night when Matthew informed me that she had, in fact, been a pig. When the club finished we wandered the streets for a while until we got to this 24-hour cafe but I didn't like the look of it so we left and got a taxi back to Morag's flat. I couldn't sleep, so I sat about drinking someone else's strawberry tonic wine and tried to keep everyone else up.

Then at ten o'clock in the morning we went downstairs to buy some drink. We had intended to watch the football in the afternoon but we'd passed out by then and slept right through it, awaking to find that England had won two-nil. Then we went to get the train home and had a few in the Station bar. We had some stuff left from the previous night's supplies so when we got home we decided to go down to John's indie disco. Same story as Friday - lots of hugging, lots of dancing etc. etc. I couldn't sleep again so went up the park to look at the tomb, taking a detour through the playpark. To get in we had to climb over a ten foot steel fence, which resulted in severe bruising of our hands, legs and groins, but we had a good laugh on the stuff, especially the tube-slide, which probably doubles up as a urinal for drunk teens. Then we walked through the woods to have a look at the tomb. It was a big disappointment, but the mist on the lake was cool.

Sunday afternoon we go up to John's with a lot of beer in time to watch the Simpsons. It was a really good episode about love always ending in tragedy except, of course, for Marge and Homer. It was quite moving at the end and to tell you the truth my eyes were a bit damp. Then we watched these young girls in swimsuits have a water fight in the street. ""Taping this, aye?"" We went up to the pub about ten. It was busy for a Sunday night, lots of people we know, including my first ever girlfriend who I still find very attractive, quite frankly, but I didn't really speak to her. She's probably still a bitch, anyway. Her friend Gillian was there, I had a chat with her, she was still quite pleasant. At the same time I watched Malcolm make some terrible attempt to try and chat up a girl we know called Jo. He made some remark about her skirt that was barely there the previous night or something. I couldn't sleep again that night, thanks to some seriously disturbing nightmares...Matthew says I should cut down on the cheese.

""Went out for the weekend, it lasted for ever, high with our friends it's officially summer."" 

I got some sleep eventually on Monday afternoon. It was a beautiful day, and later that evening Malcolm introduced me to the power of Merrydown - Â£1.79 a litre, 8.2% - mmmm..... Judith and Laura came round later and we sat in my back garden and drank. Then Matthew came round and we went up the town. It's officially summer.",The First Big Weekend,1996

I wasn't even sure it were her at first
I was ready to walk away but she smiled
And called me over and we said hello for a bit
When we back to our tables

We were trying not to look over at each other
And told our friends to stop staring
I didn't see her for the rest of the night

So I go up and speak to her
And we end up talking about our new homes
Our new jobs and our new birds

For about two and a half years
But they don't live together so he'd never find out
And you think about chasing her about school

When you were wee and lying in your bed
And listening to love songs
And pretending they were about you
And the first time you asked her out

She said no but one night you went to a wedding
And when you came back to the pub
She's changed her mind and you went out
You remember the way she swung her arms

When she held your hand
But you can't remember how she kissed
And now you've got the chance to find out

But you have to remember there's this other kiss
She's at home, wondering where you are and what you're doing
And you work hard on this kiss and you know it inside out
It's as much yours as it is hers

And it took a long time to get right
It took months of practice
And months of embarrassment but now you've got it perfected
And you've been looking forward to that kiss all week

You can see her breath in the air
Between your faces as you stand in the leaves
And she just asks you straight out
If you want to come and stay at her flat

But you make sure you get separate taxis
And you go home and there might be a slight regret
And you might wonder what you missed
But you have to remember the kiss you worked so hard on
And you'll know you've done the right thing

Arab Strap,"How can nothing ever mean something?
It goes from white to gray so fast
A new pool on a strange mattress
Helps me catch up with my past

Pass me something to wipe with
We're so easy to please
Do you worry that it's loaded?
Laced with a million little me's

So are you up for the hat trick
Or are you down for a rest?
As the whitest light between our legs
Or hidden in my chest

And if they see us on the stairs
Or if they catch us on the sink
Move quickly and brush it off
With a giggle and a wink

At least we know we're fuckable
At least we're sated and we're tired
At least the bedroom stinks
And we know we're desired
",Infrared,2001
Arab Strap,"We used to do it to ease the tension
Pretend that sex wasn't our intention
Even weeks later when they all knew
It always helped just to have a few

But now what's the point
If we're not going out?
It only makes you tired
And it makes me shout

Always the last chance for you and me
First come apologies then the plea
I wash the walls as you pack your stuff
I've had too much and you've had enough

So what's the point
When we're not meeting friends?
From midday to morning
On weekdays or weekends

We could pretend that this never started
That you're still shy, I'm still broken hearted
And we'll get pissed just to watch the telly
I'll get worked up when you flash your belly

But what's the point
If we're just staying in?
It's a lot of effort
For one big din
",Last Orders,2001
Arab Strap,"You've always thought the first time was that night on the boat
Cramped up in the bottom bunk while she slept above
I suppose it's more glamorous out at sea under the moon
Instead of pissed at a party while they laughed there instead

Twenty-three years of foreplay led up to this
But sometimes I envy my friends, sometimes I see a world of opportunity
And what if it stays out there anchored in the middle of nowhere
Maybe we should arrange to meet somewhere
You go out with yours, I'll go out with mine

You always thought the first time was on the boat
And you don't even like boats
When we got one on holiday all you could say was don't go out too far
And what if it never comes back? It just stays out there on the sea
All my favorite memories are of you and all the best times were with you
But sometimes I see a world of opportunity
And I envy my friends, twenty-three years of foreplay led up to this
What if, if it comes back?
",The Long Sea,2001
Arab Strap,"We slept in this morning and she had to get ready in a hurry
No time for her usual attention to detail
And she ran out the door
Slamming it behind her
Leaving her keys swinging and jangling

I stayed in bed until I heard the downstairs door shut
Then peeked through the blinds
And as soon as she was out of sight
I went for the keys

She never tried to make a secret of the box or
The fact it was locked or even where she kept it
But as I said at the time
""If you've nothing to hide, why hide it?""

It's one of those wee red cashbox things
And she keeps it in a drawer by the bed
Under some pictures and books
Every key she has is on the same keyring
It took me a while to find the right one

I don't know
I suppose I've had my doubts for a while there's been
Hushed phone calls virtually every night
Her friends stop talking when I come in the room
They look at each other, and I don't know
It's just a feelin'

Anyway
I eventually found the right key and
It fitted perfectly in
Put the box on top of the bed and opened it up

There were these pictures of friends and ex's
Letters, postcards, doodles, nothing bad
And then I found some sort of sex diary
And I went to the latest entry
It explicitly detailed a recent adventure up the park
With a boy she said she had forgotten about

And it got worse as it went on
The dates never made sense
There were people I had never even heard of
Eventually I had to stop reading it
Because I started to feel sick
So I put everything back the way I found it
Shut the drawer and phoned you

See, I don't know what to do
I keep having
Fantasies about leaving her Dictaphone under the pillow
Or following her when she goes to work
I've been lying about where I'm going
Just in case I can bump into her
",Love Detective,2001
Arab Strap,"You used to be part of the scenery
But now I know your name
And my mind wonders what my hands would do
To make sure that you came

She hardly said a word again tonight
I threw a book and grabbed my keys
And on the way here, I swore to myself
I'd fuck whoever I please

Everywhere I go
There's so much on show
Everyone is beautiful
And I stay dutiful

The only solid solution is to sever my hands
Stitch my mouth up, I'll blind me
Wrap me up and pack me tight
Leave me somewhere you'll never find me

Everywhere I go
There's so much on show
Everyone is beautiful
But I stay dutiful

It must just be the sun
And my desire for fun
If you did it, would you tell us?
I think I'll always be jealous
",Scenery,2001
Arab Strap,"We met on mutual ground
But you avoided my gaze
Until I lost your face
In the next morning's haze

You're shoes could've woken up the whole street
They drowned out the birds, screaming in the trees
We sat down on the stone stairs
And I watched the scars on your knees

We met on mutual ground
You fell out of your dress
This bar's not open late enough
So let's go home and make a mess

They smiled and left the room
To leave us with more space
But we stayed where we were
And just had a drink to the chase

A good night kiss equals a quick reaction
It's hard to believe, I'm fully grown
So as usual we partied on vague terms
So you could climb back on your thrown
",Screaming in the Trees,2001
Arab Strap,"You always jump and quiver
When you're coming in to land
With no runway, no guidance
No nails dug into my hand

We could ask whoever we want
We could go back to school
And see the dead laugh again
Let's get dressed up and pull

The only benefit of drinking
The downside of what we take
Some weekends I feel
Like I could always be awake

A party in a stranger's house
Have we ever met the host?
Just smile and keep talking
And get your can for a toast

We won't always be safe here
But this is where we reign
Pull it tight to protect us
We might never sleep again

They've seen me searching a stranger's house for dregs. I used to think they loved me, but now I know it's pity and they know that they can always flee this fucking city. They even said they'd help me out and give me a head start and they know that these days my cock's as numb as my heart. New blood flows. Old faces go. I like the new ones better.

Ya casi me puedo aguantar
Para no volver a verte

Ya casi puedo estar sin ti
Pero es que casi no es igual
Que olvidarte totalmente
Y todavía me quema el corazón

Me quema, por estar sin ti
Y cada día se leja la ilusión
Se aleje por vivir sin ti

Casi me olvidado ya de ti
Casi recordé como es vivir
Casi te he arrancado para
Siempre de mi corazón

Casi no me duele al admitir
Que aprendí muy bien como mentir
Pues casi no es bastante
Y la verdad como me duele
Casi morir sin ti

Ya casi logro convencer
A mis amigos que estoy bien
Ya casi duermo suficiente

Y acaso olvido que tú y yo
Quien hizo que todo acabo
Ya casi logro convencerme
Que ya no me hace daño

Tanto daño, que no estés aquí
Que cada día que pasa
Nada pasa y es mejor así

Casi me olvidado ya de ti
Casi recordé como es vivir
Casi te he arrancado para
Siempre de mi corazón

Casi no me duele al admitir

A veces hielo, a veces fuego
No sé qué voy hacer
Yo estoy atada a los impuso de tu corazón
A veces creo que me estoy enamorando
Pero me da miedo, no sé si estás mintiendo

A veces cerca, a veces lejos
No sé qué nos pasó
Tú coqueteas y te escondes
Sin dar explicación

A veces creo que me estás enamorando
Y luego que te pierdo
No sé si estás fingiendo

Todo te cojo de tu vida de tus ojos
De tu boca, de tu cuerpo
De tu alma, de tus sueños

Todo te entrego por alguno de tus besos
De sentir como tu aliento
Va quemándome por dentro
Quiero todo, todo, todo
Quiero todo de ti, de ti

Y aquellos besos que me diste
Nos los puedo olvidar y a veces siento
Que me tocas aunque ya aquí no estás
A veces siento que yo sólo vivo un sueño
Pero no me despierto porque si estoy sin ti
Me desespero

Todo te cojo de tu vida de tus ojos
De tu boca, de tu cuerpo
De tu alma, de tus sueños

Todo te entrego por alguno de tus besos
De sentir como tu aliento
Va quemándome por dentro
Quiero todo, todo, todo

Some say it's honey and the bee,
Well sit right down and let me tell you
What my love is to me.

""Candy""
I call my sugar ""Candy""
Because I'm sweet on ""Candy""
And ""Candy"" is sweet on me

He/She understands me,
My understanding ""Candy""
And ""Candy""'s always handy
When I need sympathy
I wish that there were four of him/her
So I could love much more of him/her

Is one of us,
With big black eyes
And a case in his hands.
An enigmatic smile
On his face,
And a numerical ocean
In his brain...

And a secret in his mind,
Something that we don't know.
And maybe his love will be forever.

The woman with the harp
Is one of us,
With big light eyes
And some tears in the hands.
And days without hours and time,

And words to live...

And a secret in her mind,
Something that we don't't know.
And maybe her love will be forever.

Old world, so shining,
Your scent is like (a) rusty dream in my mind.
All your sweet abundance
Is now a repulsive lie to my life.

I want to rest, to feel the taste of peace,
I want to see beyond appearances.
The blade of my brain is ready to believe...
There's the need of something else...

I'll try to break the silly things,
(the) morbid brain of a saint without a soul to know,
I'll try to taste (the) earthly goods
And the pain of a friend, with my animal sense.

Arama,"I find out there’s no one, no one on playground
So if you fall rise again, don’t stay down
Don’t you think I’m joking
Knock on the door we open
If you’re sick, you shall surely find your way around it

Good things not promised it’s a fight
As long as you alive then your future can be bright
Any ‘cause nobody knows what the future hold
So what you do is be pass it and things inna your sight
Don’t forget the past but focus on the future
High on a dream line, Martin Luther
The youth them a make it if them fight hard enough
The young fissing my brothers then my live life love
Oh yes I’ve been through it
So I come telling to do, just do it
Because I knew it
Life’s not easy, non-tall
But you can be the one that don’t fall
The summer, I’m for one, one for all

I find out there’s no one, no one on playground
So if you fall rise again, don’t stay down
Don’t you think I’m joking
Knock on the door we open
If you’re sick, you shall surely find your way around it

How long before we see that love’s the only way
And through the struggles that we juggle it will be okay
Are we immune to what is true? The message on the air
Was short to confusing, take the life out of my bed
We lose some power and it’s hard to find the way
But it’s so simple to supply it
Our bodies but starve our soul
Try to escape but there’s nowhere to go
In the land of make believe, focused on the wrong thing
Ain’t half of what you see like here’s the enemy

I find out there’s no one, no one on playground
So if you fall rise again, don’t stay down
Don’t you think I’m joking
Knock on the door we open
If you’re sick, you shall surely find your way around

Some is ordering to mothering
Old fashion to the modern
If this was a guest it took no other
Gots me, I got tired of chew life up my limy island
So who no like it then can ask that be suicidal
Getting through to me and I threw it to yourself
Respect me if you not view to yourself
You don’t wanna do to me, you don’t want to lose yourself
Nothing is so stable, all lucid and data
Your life start on to amaze me, like fine but don’t be lazy

If you fall, no you can stay down
People are moving, find your way around
If you fall, no you can stay down
People are moving, find your way around

I find out there’s no one, no one on playground
So if you fall rise again, don’t stay down
Don’t you think I’m joking
Knock on the door we open
If you’re sick, you shall surely find your way around it",Playground,2013

It’s time you let me know let me know just let go

And making your way back is harder than it was before 
Somebody got the best of you and left behind the rest of you 
Who used up your heart and kept you in the dark 

And I know there’s another side
That you never show that I gotta find
And it’s not all in my mind 
And I’m here every night and day
I could be the one your love could save
Baby you left your mark but I’m still in the dark 

Let me get this straight 
The reason why I wait 
I know you’ve been through so much pain 
Baby do I wait in vain 
If I could shed more light on you 
Tell you what was right for you 
Your beauty blinds me sure enough 
But my heart knows when it’s love 

And I know there’s another side
That you never show that I gotta find
And it’s not all in my mind 
And I’m here every night and day
I could be the one your love could save
Baby you left your mark but I’m still in the dark

No reason, alive... To cry no more

Gotta get it on the run, baby
When you ain't got nothin'

Let me relax my dome
My whole joints blown another soldier won't be coming home
Parkside is gonna miss you black foreva
Ties will never sever
You died tryin to live better
Did what you had to do and now you deceased
I hope you livin in peace don't even stress that beef
Go head and sleep count your blessings return to the essence
Everytime I see your fam word is bon I feel your presence
Its all over bearing witness like jehovah
Ain't nothing strange unless you watch your range like a rover
Follow me son, what's done is done, forgot it
God bless his soul while his bodys underground rotting
We won't forget you let a brother try to dis you
I swear to god he better have a blade and plus a pistol
Forever miss you got babies that want to kiss you
Shining like crystal, and at your wake I pass your ma a tissue

[Chorus x2]

He was only thirteen when he burst his splean
The shot was fatal
He died right there upon the kitchen table BLAOW
It happened all alone in his house
Not a creature was stirrin, not a roach or a mouse
And I was just with him, playin Sega
And buggin on the horn with some honeys like a couple of playas
And now he's gone
I'm speakin on my man K-Shawn
Forever on my mind mentally as I kick my song
 
He used to talk about the box in the closet
Where his pops kept a glock and all the safety deposits
Now he stressed, fiendin just to hold some heat
I guess it came from all the stories that he heard in the street
I can't explain it, its ill how we used to feel
I used to tell him stop playin wit that chrome-piece steel
He never listened, and now my man is missin in action
I blame it on the fools in the street that's always blastin

[Chorus x2]

Aiyyo my dreams are filled with terror
Shots gettin nearer
Paralyzed and right in front of my eyes its gettin clearer
A tragedy resulted from a brothers bad scratch
Tried to rob a deli but the gat he had was raggy
Bullets sprayed, ricocheted and automatically
Hit a bystander, young girl named Amanda
The slugs in her back by this cat buggin no crap
Another rugrat, somebody tell me where the loves at
Was only seven already on her way to heaven
She reached her day and now she won't see her wedding
Some might say that this was destined or something
But her parents only had one child and now they left with nothing
Book all that flix and when they daughter was six
Before they moved from the bricks and got caught up in the mix
They thought things would get better now they stressed forever
They last vision was image of a blood-soaked sweater

Gonna make a record in the month of May
In the month of May, in the month of May
Gonna make a record in the month of May
When the violent wind blows the wires away

Month of May, it's a violent thing
In the city, their hearts start to sing
Well, some people sing, it sounds like they're screaming
Used to doubt it but now I believe it

Month of May, everybody's in love
And the city was sent from above
And just when I knew what I wanted to say
The violent wind blew the wires away

We were shocked in the suburbs
Now the kids are all standing with their arms folded tight
Kids are all standing with their arms folded tight
Well, some things are pure and some things are right
But the kids are still standing with their arms folded tight

I said some things are pure, and some things are right
But the kids are still standing with their arms folded tight

So young, so young
So much pain for someone so young
Well, I know it's heavy, I know it ain't light
But how you gonna lift it with your arms folded tight?

First they built the road
Then they built the town
That's why we're still driving around
And around and around and around and around
And around and around and around and around
And around and around and around and around

2009, 2010 wanna make a record how I felt then
When we stood outside in the month of may
And watched the violent wind blow the wires away

If I die in the month of May
Let the wind take my body away, yeah
Wish I may or wish I might
But meet me down there with my arms folded tight

Start again in the month of May
Start again in the month of May
Come on and blow the wires away
Come on and blow the wires away

Start again in the month of May
Start again in the month of May
Come on and blow the wires away

Arcadian Ensemble,"It's a little bit funny this feeling inside 
I'm not one of those who can easily hide 
I don't have much money but boy if I did 
I'd buy a big house where we both could live 
If I was a sculptor but then again no 
Or a man who makes potions in a traveling show 
Oh I know it's not much but it's the best I can do 

My gift is my song 
And this one's for you 
And you can tell everybody this is your song 
It may be quite simple but now that it's done 
I hope you don't mind 
I hope you don't mind 
That I put down in words 

How wonderful life is while you're in the world 
I sat on the roof and kicked off the moss 
Well a few of the verses well they've got me quite cross 
But the sun's been quite kind 
While I wrote this song 
It's for people like you that 
Keep it turned on 
So excuse me forgetting 

But these things I do 
You see I've forgotten 
If they're green or they're blue 
Anyway the thing is what I really mean 
Yours are the sweetest eyes I've ever seen 
And you can tell everybody this is your song 
It may be quite simple but 
Now that it's done 

I hope you don't mind

Arcady Brachlianoff,"Coiffé d'un large sombrero
Vêtu d'une veste à carreaux
Et chaussé de bottes légères
Hier dans une boîte de nuit
On vit arriver seul sans bruit
Un homme d'allure étrangère
Ses yeux avaient des reflets verts
C'était le reflet des pelouses
Sa voix avait un timbre clair
Il avait un accent de Toulouse
Un peu plus tard quand il sortit
En donnant son ticket d'vestiaire
La dame du vestiaire lui dit
Cette phrase très singulière

Monsieur, Monsieur
Vous oubliez votre cheval
Ne laissez pas ici cet animal

Il y serait vraiment trop mal
Monsieur, Monsieur, pour un pur-sang dans un vestiaire
C'est triste de passer la nuit entière
Sans même coucher dans un' litière
Comme il s'ennuyait
Et comme il bâillait
Je chantais pour qu'il soit sage
Comme il avait faim
Qu'j'n'avais plus d'pain
J'y ai donné un peu d'potage
Monsieur, Monsieur
Chose pareille est anormale
Ne laissez pas ici cet animal

À ses p'tits enfants expliquait
Des aventures invraisemblables
Il avait un sourire amer
Et comme il se croyait loup d'mer
Il jurait et crachait à table
Tout en mâchonnant un mégot
Il y allait de son bavardage
Il ne parlait que de cargos
De tempêtes et d'abordages
Mais les p'tits enfants pas dupés
Montrant un tableau qui s'effrite
S'écriaient ""Grand-père, ce beau pré""
""C'est-y la mer ou Maisons-Laffitte!""

Usted se suelta el pelo cuando baila y me enloquece (farru)

Déjate llevar por el boom boom

Pégate a mi cuerpo
No te hagas la loca y baila 
Tú no eres una santa

Más allá de darnos un par de copas

Sigue rozándome así, guayando 
Como te brilla la piel sudando 
Sigue sigue me estás descontrolando

Dejame tocarme tu piel

Despues en mi cama guayando,sigueme
Dejame llevarte a una etapa
Donde el nene te atrapa
Permiteme pegarme como lapa

Y dime lo que te gusta que te hagan

Arcángel,"Aja, quisiera quererte con sentimiento
Hacerte el amor con elegancia
Y seducirte con maldad

Haciéndolo muy lento
En mi habitación como tiene que ser
Disfrutándonos, gozándonos
Cada minuto hasta el amanecer

En la cama hagamos un juramento
Por todas las noches darnos placer
Amándonos, gozándonos
Cada minuto hasta el amanecer

Al parecer todo fue inesperado
Y tan inesperado fue
Que ya me gusta demasiado
Si tú no estás me siento desesperado
Pero todo cambia mami cuando estas a mi lado

Entonces tú me dices (tú me sigues)
Te puede ir bien si a mí tú me eliges
No tengo tiempo para el pasado
Yo prefiero contigo estar acostado (pra)

Haciéndolo muy lento
En mi habitación como tiene que ser
Disfrutándonos, gozándonos
Cada minuto hasta el amanecer

En la cama hagamos un juramento
Por todas las noches darnos placer
Amándonos, gozándonos
Cada minuto hasta el amanecer

Y al parecer no te estuvo suficiente
Y me llamaste al otro día de repente
Me lo encuentro curioso
Que me hayas escogido a mi entre tanta gente

Dímelo de frente, si así lo siente
Te juro que por siempre voy a estar pendiente
A lo que te pase, o a lo que te suceda
El que invente contigo se queda
Tu y yo seguimos

Haciéndolo muy lento
En mi habitación como tiene que ser
Disfrutándonos, gozándonos
Cada minuto hasta el amanecer

En la cama hagamos un juramento
Por todas las noches darnos placer
Amándonos, gozándonos
Cada minuto hasta el amanecer

A mí no me interesa lo que hiciste
Ni lo que dejaste de hacer en tu pasado (baby)
Lo que realmente me importa
Es que soy yo quien está a tu lado

Dime cuando
Porque lo estas pensando
Y te decidirás a no mirarás hacia atrás
Sin saber que soy capaz de quererte

Hasta cuando
Vas a seguir pensando
Y te decidirás a no mirarás hacia atrás
Sin saber que soy capaz de tenerte

Te fuiste rápido aquel día y me quede pensando
Que vas a hacer, dime que harás, volver a verte cuando
Aquel problema no somos ni tú ni yo
Aquí el problema es la gente mala a nuestro alrededor
Pero con clase nos comportamos
No nos dejamos ver que bien actuamos
Me gusta la manera en que jugamos

A veces ni nos hablamos

Arcángel,"Me gusta el humo de desayuno 
sueño, pienso en dinero mientras fumo 
y prendo lento, muy violento 
mientras emprendo un viajecito hacia Neptuno 

Le pedí a Dios que me mande un pote nuevo 
pues el que tengo esta lleno y tengo ganas de llenar un tercero 
un cuarto suena bien, tal vez un quinto 
aunque tenga que dejar un par de raperos extintos 
todo sale bien, como por instinto. 

Como un pincel letras en mi mente pinto 
y me mantengo en esto papi porque soy distinto 
lo manto en el chanteo socio hasta con el requinto 

Y me resisto a dejarlo de brillar 
mi autoestima no es la misma desde que empese a cantar 
y no es cuestión de ponerse a frontear 
aquí se demuestra con trabajo, entonces vamos a trabajar 



Cuando era niño tenía un sueño 
y aunque yo quería cantar 
gracias a Dios se me dió ese sueño 
y ahora no tengo mas na' en que pensar 

Primero yo, segundo yo y mi fucking dinero

Me quieren demandar, se van par de pesos 
sea la madre me aborrece ese fuc*** proceso 
pero ta' to' bien sigo vivo, sigo ileso 
y hay par de cabrones que están mordios por eso 

Si, yo se que a ustedes no les gusta recordar 
será porque yo cambié y ustedes siguen iguales 

Yo sé que duele tener que soportar 
que yo tenga que brillar 
y ustedes sin poder llegar 

Sé que les duele 
por eso llego a conclusión 
que si algún día me caigo en el abismo tengo una mansión

Arcángel,"Sentimiento
En el orden estrictamente fisiológico 
Es la acción y el efecto de sentir o sentirse 
Y el estado de consciencia 
Datado de tonalidad efectiva 
Y con caracteres de cierta duración y significado 

Yo gracias le doy a Dios 
Por engrandecer mi bolsillo 
Y bendecirme a mí, también a mi corillo
Voy a España, ceno lomillo de cochinillo 
Alquilo to' el hotel 
(Me hago dueño del pasillo) 

Su envida es tanta 
Que por mi dinero quieren demandar 
No me llamen este weekend 
Que me fui a Suiza a depositar 
Lero lero, lero leuro, Francos, Libras y Euros 
Tengo un par de dolares 
Que suelo usar de pretty cash 
De tanto contar dinero 
Ya en la mano me dio Rash 
Fast cash, dinero rápido 
Mujeres internacionales pidiendo látigo 
Aun no muero, tengo un flow muy cabrón 
Ya mismo hacemos un concierto en Japón 
Y me huele socio que si sigo subiendo 
Ya mismo me voy de gira para Pluton 
Tengo mi respect y vino de vango tengo todo sed 
Y en el jet se disfruta mejor el aire 
My good on bless vivo mi vida sin estrés 
Dominando continentes con mi American Xpress 
Flow miami, she love sushi 
Par de tragos y me suelta el cuchicuchi 
Louis Vuitton, mucho Armani, mucho Gucci 
Alcohol y piña colada, mis gafas dicen Pradda 
Prrra flow New York she love aguas oh oh oh hei 
Everything, every agua 
Tiraou pa' tras chilling en lo mío 
halla en le bloque dicen Arcángel esta frío 

Elegancia: 
Para mi la elegancia es una forma perfecta 
De expresar perfectamente los sentimiento 
Con una calidad de vida y sobre todo mucho estilo 

Dile a tu brujo o a tu santero que menee mejor la hoya 
Que nadie para a este caballito de trolla 
Hoy en día todos lo que me tiren se van 
Directamente pa' los brazos de Satán 
Yo soy mas que una leyenda como el Príncipe de Persia 
Fenómeno dueño de la controversia 
Muchos dicen que el nene esta decayendo 
No es que estaba muy rápido subiendo 
Si era que estaba muy rápido cantando 
Viajando ya que estaba muy rápido matando 
Yo como le metí la cabra, rápido 
Le demostré que no estaba jugando 
Que estoy puesto pa' lo mio 
Si hay chavo acepto cualquier desafío 
Si hay chavo me atrevo a buscarme un lío 
Por mi chavo puedes salir partio 
Prrra 
Te puede pasar una tragedia, si ahi chavo 
Tu vida se convierte en comedia 
¿Qué mas? 
Tirame pa' tras y veras que en la nueva escuela 
Yo soy el capataz, primer lugar 
Firts play y tu last, ultimo 
Sigo mi vida higt class 
Miami sun past 
La mujer la monte en la guaba 
Par de sicarios a tras, 
Hey quieto novato tu sabes como lo hago 
Yo los apago hasta cuando cago 
Bajo el toilet y el corte sera cabrón 
Flotando a los cantantes por la vía del mojón 
Aguanto mi presión no meando goyo 
Tienen guille de carlitos pero aquí soy el que arrollo 
Salimos a flote ya no estamos en el hoyo 
Ustedes son mucha película pa' poco rollo

Y a los títeres de embuste, diles que hagan los ajustes 
Que andamos borrando hocicos con par de fulles 

Baja al trabajo y otro carro que hoy vamos a desmantelar 
que te pillemos en la avenida en su madre se va a cagar 
Esto no es relajo, lambe bicho, demuestre su hombría 
A sangre fría si te agarro, pa te voy a dejar de día 

Puro malianteo, ya salieron Los Menores 
No riegan veneno, pero papi sin cojones a mi me tienen 
Mucha tormenta es lo que viene 
Con música hija de puta es que Ñengo se mantiene, so cabrón 

Ya estoy manso muchachos o ¿quieres ver como me agacho? 
Le engancho el peine a mi macho y sin pensar te la respacho 
Ustedes son queso con nachos pai dime, ¿tú estás borracho? 
Acho en cualquier sentido te esparracho 

Las pacas y los billetes las he visto en purrucha 
Hago todo lo que quiero, y si no quiero escucharte, ya 
Yo mando a regar la voz, los burros estoy dando dos 
Se te adelanto, lo siento lechón, llegó Navidad 

Jingle bells, el panzón como Santa Claus 
Mi pipa y la glock, siempre sujeta en el calzon 
Bebo date un resbalón, que me has dado la impresión 
Que tu tienes mucho combo, pero no con corazón 

Ya Los Menores salen pa' la calle 
Lo más que suenan en la calle vivo se han quedao' 
Las cosas ya no son iguales 
Y del caserío no salen 

Pa hablarte claro, ustedes están dando asco 
Mientras yo ando por ahí, wheeliando en la moto sin casco 
Millonario, cabrón yo estoy tirao' pa' atras 
Lo que cuesta el carro tuyo, vale un canto de mi Four Track 

Soy el terror de muchos, el chamaquito incorregible 
Él que a los 22 tiene 3 casas y convertibles 
Él favorito de la calle, y del genero el más terrible 
Que entierra a los demonios y a los muertos los revive 

Soy yo, el que la sigue llevando 
Él que le han tirao' la mala y como quiera esta matando 
Él Titerito, el que sigue comandando 
De to' ustedes el más que está facturando

Y este artista de WyY tiene derecho

Y mira ahora quien llegó, la gárgola de ""Agresivo""
Rompiendo y partiéndolos, educándolos con mi flow
Son las mujeres las que hacen que yo salga de noche
(¡Tuti!) (¡Blam, blam!) WD-40 pa'l Lacoste
Suelto suelto y sigo envuelto
Y viendo como paralizo tu momento
Heyyyy, yo siendo la voz del momento
La única gárgola que el sol no convierte en cemento

No dejes que se te hunda el barco y cómprate un parco
Te aplasto, chequea en tarima cómo es que parto
Le caí de asalto, el bacalao reparto
Tú pediste tres tazas y saliste harto
(¡Ah!) Ya resolvimos marroneándola
No busques más, somos las gárgolas
La quinta parte fundiéndola
La compe', tu combo de la envidia se rompe
Porque ahora estamos encendidos, ¿y tú a donde?

(¡Say yeah!) Déjalos que se resbalen
Si saben que con nosotros no salen
(¡Say yeah!) Hago que mis gárgolas se preparen
Que 'tamos en guerra, listos, sin miedo a morir
(¡Say yeah!) Déjalos que se resbalen

(¡Say yeah!) Hago que mis gárgolas se preparen
Que 'tamos en guerra, listos, sin miedo a morir

(¡Oye!)
Ese negro es gárgola, es el negro
No hablen mucho, saben 'e donde vengo
Tengo mi propio flow, no me vendo
Si no sirve es que es sendo cerdo
No amenaces, nunca tiemblo
Mala mía si te ofendo
Yo no ofrezco si no tengo
Tú quieres que encienda
Prendo prendo (¡Ma'!)

Esto es pa' las gárgolas, sin miedo
Entra Cosculluela y to' el mundo se cae al suelo
Pa' tirarte contra mi 'tas bien loco
Hay muchos que suenan como tú
Pero como yo suenan pocos o ninguno
Salgo gigantesco y oportuno...
Consumo el humo mientras cargo el peine de la sumo
Gilipolla, prende bien atrás que 'ta la hoya
Que quien no atiende la cocina el kiosko se la arrollan
A mi me encanta saber que tengo lo mío plancha'o
Y si me muero mañana te juro que me fui gasta'o
Cuñao, brega en el norte que yo sigo las señales
Suenen los timbales, jale, bajen los metales
Disque 'toy en guerra, ¿con quien?, nunca se sabe
Cuando sientas la presión, men, esa es la clave
Sigo firme, me paro en la mía y que van a decirme
El príncipe del verso, no vayan a confundirme

(¡Say yeah!) Déjalos que se resbalen
Si saben que con nosotros no salen
(¡Say yeah!) Hago que mis gárgolas se preparen
Que 'tamos en guerra, listos, sin miedo a morir
(¡Say yeah!) Déjalos que se resbalen
Si saben que con nosotros no salen

Que 'tamos en guerra, listos, sin miedo a morir

De la historia del reggaeton!
""Los Benjamins""!
Nosotros somos el dream team

Socio, ando con la calle velando
No quiero fantasmeo, pa'
Mira, socio, no se meta en mi negocio
Ese tumba'o conmigo no va
Ando solea'o, con mi combo activa'o
Velando por si alguien tira un trambo
Un paso en falso te das, charlatán
Y te mueres (¡Se van!)

Piensen bien si quieren guerrear conmigo (se van)
Estoy ready pa' comérmelos vivos (se van)
Tengo el dedo en el click
Solo es cuestión de quitar el seguro
Si quiero abuso
Piensen bien si quieren guerrear conmigo
Estoy ready pa' comérmelos vivos
Tengo el dedo en el click
Solo es cuestión de bajar el seguro
Solo hay un intento

Mírenme, como un humilde se revela
El general de la vieja y de la nueva escuela
Si no sabes de historia es mejor que te calles
¿Quién viene matando aquí desde los tiempos de Playe'?
Cuando no había radio, vídeo ni prensa
A mi me hizo la calle, a to's ustedes sus disqueras
Desde el principio mucha gente me han tira'o
Sigo vivo y respeta'o, nadie me ha apaga'o
Quieren sembrar el miedo como Jack the Ripper
Y ustedes meten mano, es verdad, pero en los zipper
Y no me importa si tienen combo, si tienen torta
Yo mis enemies les tiro con trafico y con mi escolta
Mírenme, como un humilde se revela
El general de la vieja y de la nueva escuela

Soy el único veterano que tiene la sangre nueva
Un gigante aquí, tanto así
Que solo le dan portada cuando hablan de mí
Me ven en BET, TRL por MTV, ¡please!
Pa' acá tu no podrás subir
¿Quieres llegar a mi nivel? Les daré dos soluciones:
Cante más y no hable tanta mierda en tus canciones
Sigo subiendo everyday
El pasado, presente y futuro way
Si esto fuera la NBA
Fuera Dr. J, Jordan y Lebron James

Abran pasa al ministro, yo suministro
Yo controlo las calles y los gistros
El profesor moreno controlando la carretera
Postea'o en la escalera
Con la burra te tabaco y madera
El enviado con moño y que anda aborrecido
El que se me pegue de aquí se va partido
Entren y sáquenmelo del caserío
Que ando con la trulla y con la espalda frio
Que no te pille en un carrito de piraguas
Abanza como, titichaguas por el área de Caguas
Va haber lluvia de balas, cómprate un paraguas
Bobo, yo soy el capo, tu solo gritas ""Agua!""

Usted es una rata, siga cantando pa' las gatas
Que en esto de la calle, papi, puedes ser mi chata
Trata, pa meterme por la culata
Coge por la orilla o te vo'a sacar la guata (ajaja)
Quieres sentir la ronca, siga tirando balas locas
Soca', 'tas guerreando con el motha*fucka'
Te tengo en coca, salte del carril que va la truck'a
Mamabicho, yo a usted no le quepo por la boca

Te voy a dar con mis becerros
Yo los mato como el Cerro
Mama*hierro, hagan planes pa' su entierro
Mucho guille pa' después llamar los perros
Yo no le temo a la muerte, a la vida nunca me aferro
Yo soy de calle cria'o, mucha vidas eh privau
Ando con una estrella en el pecho y la morena al la'o
Usted es un bobo cria'o, no sea tan caripela'o
Si no quiere que le vuele el pecho camine con cuida'o

Déjense ver que quiero saber quien va tumbarme el vuelo
Cada vez que salgo a to' estos viejos se les paran los pelos
Hipócritas, no me saluden, y rompan el hielo
Háblame claro y pal suelo, llego antes OK
El de la morena y me guille el que los trilla
En bolsa negra y camilla me fui a las millas
Como los cepilla, les da fuego y los levanta del piso
Y siempre fiel los pilla

Y no pueden con mi ""productivity""
Ustedes conmigo no tienen ni una ""opportunity""
Pues, compárense con mis ""capacity""

Ninguno queda cabrón, como siempre, maravilloso

Versatilidad y estilo difícil de copiar
La maravilla, el bajo mundo me aclama
Y entiendo que 'toy prepara'o para el dinero y la fama
Me critican porque el mejor de los novatos me creo
No es que me creo, es que ninguno igual a mi palabreo
Yo me destaco por ser entre ellos el primero

Sigue siguiendo la vida sabiendo que a un la amaba 
Cuando pensé que esa mujer a mi no me importaba llegaron 
[?] que yo nunca me esperaba era el dolor el sufrimiento 
Lo q me segaba al no darme cuenta que eras solo una malvada 
El cariño que te daba tu lo despreciabas 
q era otro que en las noche tus labio besaba 
Con razón tu me peleabas cuando preguntaba 
Que si eras 100% fiel pero lo ignorabas que las cosas que vivimos 
Quedaron borradas solo un par de cicatrices 
Quedaron marcadas y unos cuantos pensamientos 
que en mi mente vagan pero recuerda que el que la hace aquí la paga

Arcángel,"En esta única canción los limites no hacen parte
Por eso hoytres mentes distintas se unen en lo mas débil
Rindiéndose a los pies de quien nos robó le corazón

Mi amor es pobre no tiene casa ni dinero
Camina por las calles del corazón tuyo
Pidiendo como un limosnero
Ámame por favor ábreme el corazón
No ves que me mata el silencio mientras callas
No se como pedirte mas que no te vayas

Si tu me has visto cerquita del corazón tuyo
Es porque a tu lado construyo
Una casita pa vivirla mientras poco a poco sufro y me destruyo
Amarte a ti es mi pasatiempo
El tuyo es irte como el viento
Ignorando mis sentimientos mientras yo muriendo
Quedo en la nada

Me hice promesas yo mismo me juré olvidarte
Y no tuve fuerzas
Solo las tengo para amarte
Amame por favor o arrancame el corazón
No ves que me mata el silencio mientras callas
No se como pedirte mas que no te vayas

Si tu me has visto cerquita del corazón tuyo
Es porque a tu lado construyo
Una casita pa vivirla mientras poco a poco sufro y me destruyo
Amarte ya es mi pasatiempo el tuyo irte como el viento
Ignorando mis sentimientos mientras yo muriendo
Quedo en la nada

Ya tengo débil el corazón
Un día al menos los ojos llenos de lagrimas hay amor

Si tu me has visto cerquita del corazón tuyo
Es porque a tu lado construyo
Una casita pa' vivirla mientras poco a poco sufro y me destruyo
Amarte a ti es mi pasatiempo (pasatiempo)
El tuyo es irte como el viento 
Ignorando mis sentimientos mientras yo muriendo
Quedo en la nada

No existe fortuna fama o placer
Que se compare por lo que sentimos
Por lo mas hermoso del universo la Mujer
Solo los mejores nos unimos
Para expresar lo que sentimos

Hace tiempo que no estas a mi lado 
Hace tiempo que no amanecemos juntos 
Hace tiempo que no te veo adorarme 
Hace tiempo que noce pero mucho te e extrañado 
Hace tiempo todavia pasa el tiempo 
Y aun tenemos tiempo para amar 
Podemos centarnos 
Y analisar juntos 
Aprender de nuestros errores 
Puedes tener mil aventuras mil amores 

Pero nadie te va a amar como yo 
Oouho nou no no no 
(Imposible) 
Pero nadie te va a amar como yo 
Oouho woo nou no no no 
Pero nadie te va a amar como yo 

Todavia me pregunto como te perdi 
Si como romeo y julieta 
Viviamos nuestra relacion 
Es que no estiendo como pudo terminar asi 
Noo 
Es que de todas con tigo queria 
Pasar el resto de mis dias 
Siento siento 
El deber yo siento 
De confesar los sentimientos 
Que hoy en dia viven y mueren en mi corazon 
Siento siento 
Enloquecer asi eh eh 
A ver si un dia 
Alguien te va a amar como yo 

Nadie te va a amar como yo lo ise 
A ti nadie te querra como yo te quise 
Consulta con tu corazon aver que te dice 
Que mi amor fue verdadero y no dejo sicatrices 
Nooou 
Yo conosco a mi nena 
Tu puedes provar en otras personas pero ninguno tellena 
Que te aga el amor mejor que yo en la luna llena 
Dime quien comvertira en alegria todas tus penas 
Nunca digas nunca 
Que el mundo da mil vueltas 
Y mi corazon todavia te abunda 
(Por tu vida pueden pasar un millon de personas)

Llego a la barra y me voy manifestando

To’ el mundo perreando, to’ el mundo sudando 

Yo en el perreo me encuentro una mami 
Que dice que tiene una sorpresita pa’ mí 
Me subió la nota imaginando cuál será 
No pensé mucho y me la llevé por la parte de atrás 

La gente se pregunta qué demonios está pasando 
Las botellas del momento se están acabando 
Pero al vernos a nosotros saben lo que está pasando

Pero esas actitudes lo que han hecho es alejarme

Tirarme a un lugar donde la luz enfoca 
Donde el alcohol es bueno de los besos en la boca 
Donde mi piel se arropa 
De nenas que me quieren 
Para hacer en la cama cositas que tu no quieres

Y es que veo en ti el coqueteo woah 
Muchas chamitas ma’ y no de trasteos 
Yo sé que pasa que estás en el aguajeo
Yo no titubeo, voy voy pal’ jangeo

Te veo bye bye , me espera el combo 
Siento que voy a beber hasta el fondo 
Yo no me porto mal pero ella es diferente 
Hecho que olvida lo que diga la gente

Tengo rima panchi orality plasty
Mis bolsillos están de show me llaman el ticket master 
Silla cuando como si nada te importa
Sé que te dolerá que otra se gaste la torta
Si me quiere pégate, si no quiere aléjate
Pero de la silla me paro sus labios le robaré
Ya esta listo el maquinón, voy directo al vacilón
Me espera la gata el combo con mucho Bacardi y limón

En los bolsillos siempre con dos pacas ando
Con un combo de locos que no están jugando
Andamos sin miedo y por eso
Salgo pa' la calle siempre con dos peines largos
En los bolsillos siempre con dos pacas ando
Con un combo de locos que no están jugando
Andamos sin miedo y por eso

Como me busco la grasa, las cubetas de hielo que tengo en casa
Están al tope, por que lo que consumen no lo rechazan
Desenmoño el topo e' menta, en billetes de 50
Y tu comprando 31 que no cocina en la lenta
Yo sé que les da depre saber to' lo que facturo
Porque viven del menudo, es que mi pauta esta en Neptuno
Te caes si tu me miras, o molestar en la calma china
O tener mira bajaron las F negras en campanilla
Compramos los mil kit de 100 que son pa' las glopetas
Si aprietan van a correr tu y tu mujer en chancletas
A la milla, aquí van de raja pa' la silla
Tengo el money, como dicen los Domi eso a ti te quilla'
Frabian, aquí se descarta a to' el que copera
Yo les paro el explorer siempre antes de 3 letras
Las veinte y cremas, andamos disfrazados de onilafea
Un arresto, te secuestro, y vas de rabo a la candela

Papi yo me busco el peso, pregúntale a Homie
Tengo money, en par de países loco un par de Cholis
Ahora tengo par de pesos, en efectivo
Me mantienen vivos los billetes se llevan conmigo
Benjamin es mi mejor amigo, Jackson es mi primo
Washington mi compadre y fue a la escuela con Lincoln
Revolucionario como tu Duatlon Santo Domingo
I'm a king, en puertorro Luis Muñoz Marin
Yo siempre he sido un soñador, quise ser compositor
Luego me convertí en cantautor
Quería ser un liricista
Puñeta artista  y me convertí en inversionista
Al envidioso digo Tranquilo Bobi
Matarte es mi hobby, en el closh como Kobe
Pa las mujeres soy seguro un orgasmo
Duro y dulce, me llaman el durazno

Salgo pa' la calle siempre con dos peines largos
En los bolsillos siempre con dos pacas ando
Con un combo de locos que no estan jugando
Andamos sin miedo y por eso
Salgo pa' la calle siempre con dos peines largos
En los bolsillos siempre con dos pacas ando
Con un combo de locos que no estan jugando
Andamos sin miedo y por eso

Hacen reuniones pa' setiarme, dicen que quieren cazarme
Mamenmen el bicho, de ninguno voa dejarme
Aborrecido, harto e' odio damos fuego con los palos también
Que paso? No te gusto? Yo no soy un billete de 100
To' van pal casco, pa' que les de agua los fiscales
Te vamos a procesar con los metales (rascabolas)
Y a los titeres de embuste dile que hagan los ajustes
Que andamos borrando hocicos con un par de fulles
Hoy hay trabajo, hay otro carro que vamos a desmantelar
El que pillemos en la avenida en su madre se va a cagar
Esto no es relajo, lambebicho, demuestre su hombría
A sangre fria si te agarro, pa te voy a dejar de dia
Puro malianteo, ya salieron Los Menores
No riego veneno, pero papi sin cojones pai a mi me tienen
Mucha tormenta es lo que viene
Con musica hija e' puta es que Ñengo se mantiene, so cabron

Ya estoy manso muchachos o quieres ver como me agacho?
Le engancho el peine a mi macho y sin pensar te la respacho
Ustedes son queso con nachos partirme, tu estas borracho?
Acho en cualquier sentido te desparracho
Las pacas y los billetes las he visto encurrucha'
Hago todo lo que quiero, y si no quiero escucharte, ya
Yo mando a regar la voz, los burros estoy dando dos
Se te adelanto lo siento lechon llego Navidad
Jingle bells, el panzon como Santa Claus
Mi pipa y la glock, siempre sujeta' en el calzon
Bebo date un resbalon, que me has dado la impresión
Que tu tienes mucho combo, pero no con corazón brra

Ya Los Menores salen pa la calle
Los mas que suenan en la calle bebo se han quedao
Las cosas ya no son iguales
Y del caserio no salen

Pa hablarte claro, ustedes están dando asco
Mientras yo ando por ahí, willeando en la moto sin casco
Millonario, cabrón yo estoy tirao' pa' atras
Lo que vale el carro tuyo, vale un canto de mi Four Track
Soy el terror de muchos, el chamaquito incorregible
El que a los 22 tiene 3 casas y convertibles
El favorito de la calle, y del genero el mas terrible
El que entierra a los demonios y a los muertos los revive
Soy yo, el que la sigue llevando
El que le han tirao' la mala y como quiera esta matando
El Titerito, el que sigue comandando

Solo déjame entrar y vas a ver que al final te va a gustar 

Nos vamos pal oscuro mama 
Tenemos tu y yo las mismas fuertes ganas 
Hagamoslo despacio pa' matar las ganas

Y me buscas a mí, me empiezas a decir
Que lo quieres dejar, que él ya no te hace feliz 
Que prefieres alguien como yo que te haga reír

Comienzas a llorar
Y me preguntas si me puedes abrazar
Digo que sí y te acercas a mí
Me dices que ya estás cansada de sufrir

El abrazo se empieza a prolongar
Me tratas de besar y no te quieres ir
Tu celular no para de sonar
Sabes que es él y no le quieres contestar

Ya como es obvio que tienes que irte
Tú con prisa te desvistes
Te me trepas encima

Yo tengo tu solución
Te vas cuando no te quede una gota más (quiere decir)

Hace tiempo que no sé nada de ti
Si todo está bien con él ni pasas por aquí

Ni un texto, al parecer no existo
Yo no te molesto ni insisto
Sólo deseo que tengas otra pelea
Es la única oportunidad para que te vea

Qué iluso soy, soy un sángano
Que pierde el tiempo en vano
Sólo me sirve que tarde o temprano
Él te haga sentir mal y así yo gano

Pero en realidad no gano, qué va
Sólo me usas y luego te vas
Para ti soy tu desquite y nada más
Tan sólo soy tu paño de lágrimas

Estaba para ti y tú siempre pa' mí 
Eramos Bonny and Clyde modernos 
Aunque nadie quería entendernos 

Y por eso me fui al más allá por ti 
Por tu piel y solo por ti 
Ando mal, más que mal o más que loco 
Patinando mal del coco, tú me tienes a mí 

Pensándote, recordando todo tu cuerpo 
Cuando te acostabas en mi pecho 
Después de haber hecho el amor en exceso 

Pensándote, recordando todo tu cuerpo 
Cuando te acostabas en mi pecho 
Después de haber hecho el amor en exceso 

Aquí te espero, si te acercas 
Ven donde mí, te siento cerca 
No te alejes
En la guerra del amor, me muero si no me proteges 

Cuídame, vélame, abrázame 
Bésame, tócame, siénteme 
Ya que ando mal, más que mal o más que loco 
Y demostrando que yo

Tengo un vicio por ti 
Buscando que vuelvas a mi 
No encuentro la manera de llegar a ti 
Bendita noche, por ti viví mamita yo iré 
Buscando una señal, no sé si estas igual 
No me puedo controlar, sigo esperando a que vuelvas 

Pensándote, recordando todo tu cuerpo 
Cuando te acostabas en mi pecho 
Después de haber hecho el amor en exceso 

Pensándote, recordando todo tu cuerpo 
Cuando te acostabas en mi pecho 
Después de haber hecho el amor en exceso 

Baby 
Aquí me tienes pensando en ti como siempre, 
Bajo la sombra de la duda 
Esperando inventar el pretexto más tonto 
Para salir a buscarte 
Y arrojar las palabras que me traigo 
Para confesarte la falta que me haces 
¿Quieres que te sea sincero? 
No sabía que decir y me metí a internet 
A buscar un mensaje bonito y te lo dediqué 
Este es él que no espera

Lento, como un cohete en el espacio 
Voy ha agarrarme de tu pelo lacio 
Y voy a hacer de nuestra habitación un gimnasio 

Y voy a darte taller como tú necesitas

Yo me voy contigo a tu casa si tú me invitas

Arcángel,"Yo soy de aquí
Del barrio que me vio nacer
De la esquina que me vio crecer
Del callejón con los panas fumando
Con fama soñando
Cantando y llegué.
Lejos del barrio estaba otra ciudad
Y en otro cielo se escuchó mi canción
Pero lo que jamás podré olvidar
Es de donde salí pues eso es lo que soy

Yo soy de aquí, bien orgulloso me siento
Directo de PR los reyes del movimiento
Don-Don, Yandel esto no es un invento
Esto es algo que cotizao’ son más de quinientos mil
A mi público yo le doy las gracias
Porque a pesar de la distancia nos siguen con ansias
Don-Don, Yandel mucho porte y elegancia
Talento desde la infancia
Porque soy de aquí
Pa’ lante voy a seguir
No voy a permitir
Que nadie me ponga el píe
Yo voy a tirar pa’ lante

Papi yo soy de aquí y aunque en Puerto Rico no nací
Represento la tierra donde yo crecí
Acostumbrado al tambor y al sonido del coquillo
Yo soy así de calma, sí, yo soy de aquí
Donde en esto comencé y con la calle me inspiré
Primero gatié, me paré y luego caminé
Poco a poco fui forrándome en plata
Viajando el mundo más que una azafata
Y yo no sé si tú lo entiendes pero así las cosas van
Conozco el avión por dentro
Ya parezco un capitán
Gracias a Dios le doy por escuchar mi coro
Le pedí plata y me respondió con oro

Yo soy de aquí
Del barrio que me vio nacer
De la esquina que me vio crecer
Del callejón con los panas fumando
Con fama soñando
Cantando y llegué
Lejos del barrio estaba otra ciudad
Y en otro cielo se escuchó mi canción
Pero lo que jamás podré olvidar
Es de donde salí pues eso es lo que soy

Nací pobre pero un tesoro vive dentro de mi corazón
Y esa es la perla del Caribe
Quien arropa mi bandera cuando duermo en campo santo
Es el orgullo de la isla del encanto
Varios los frustra con to’ lo mío
Entramos por el monte y salimos por el río
Un ícono mundial vacilando en los chinchorros
Mi gente fuerte y firme como el morro
Soy el indio, el esclavo y conquistador
Par de manos
Soy el hijo de la humildad, la libertad y del tirano
Un talento del caserío (ajá)
Donde la esperanza es una *** (ajá)
Donde los difuntos resucitan (¿Cómo?)
En forma de graffiti

Yo soy de aquí
Del barrio que me vio nacer
De la esquina que me vio crecer
Del callejón con los panas fumando
Con fama soñando

Lejos del barrio estaba otra ciudad

Arcángel,"Al pasar el tiempo aprendí 
Que no era solamente yo 
Que tú sin mí puedes ser tú 
Pero sin ti yo no soy yo 
No sé qué me pasó 
Siento que me pierdo 
Siguen pasando los días 
Y más yo te recuerdo

Tú serás para siempre 
Lo más que quiero yo 
Yo seré para ti 
Un triste recuerdo 

Tú serás para siempre 
Lo más que quiero yo 
Yo seré para ti 
Un triste recuerdo 

Si esta almohada hablara el mundo se enteraría de mis secretos 
Como que tengo de todo pero sin ti sigo incompleto 
Que triste ironía recordar que un día fuiste mía 
Pero tengo que aceptarlo aunque mi alma esté vacía 
Lloro como un niño cada vez que miro el portafolio 
Yo sin ti por esta vida es como el mundo sin petróleo 
Tengo el control del juego y de todo su monopolio 
Pero mi corazón se sigue acercando a su velorio 
Aun hay vida porque nunca se da una despedida 
Sin que dios decida una chance a una mujer arrepentida 
Un hombre que se arrepiente nadando sin corriente 
En un océano donde no se oculta lo que se siente, baby

En tu soledad 
Yo sé que no dejas de pensar al igual que yo 
Cuando hacíamos el amor 
Y ya todo has borrado 

En tu soledad 
Yo sé que no dejas de pensar al igual que yo 
Cuando hacíamos el amor 
Y ya todo has borrado 

Y ya quisiera que algún día cayeras en tiempo
Que no solo vivas el momento 
Que te detengas y pienses 
Que todo pasa como el viento 
Mientras se sufre es lento 
Quisiera que recapacites baby 
Y que juntos terminemos el cuento 
Que no lo facilites baby 
Deja mostrarte lo mas profundo de mis sentimientos 
Mientras paseamos, de amor hablamos 
Y si lo perdimos, lo recuperamos 
Luego nos besamos y recapacitamos 
Actuemos, que el amor revive si luchamos

Tú serás para siempre 
Lo más que quiero yo 
Yo seré para ti 
Un triste recuerdo

Tú serás para siempre 
Lo más que quiero yo 
Yo seré para ti 
Un triste recuerdo

Querida luna que me escuchas Y alumbras todas mis noches 
Dile que me perdone y el pasado no me reproche 
Que somos humanos y nos equivocamos por error 
Y lo importante es arreglarlo y hacerlo mejor 
Dile, la casa sigue igual, sus cosas son intocables 
En cada esquina de este hogar hay un momento inolvidable 
Una lagrima se derrama, un corazón que la llama 
Y antes de yo acostar a la otra prefiero botar la cama 
Me hago daño pero es que la extraño 
De nada me valen los consejos ni los regaños 
Pueden pasar mil años, pa' el amor no hay límites ni tamaños 
Yo te seguiré dedicando conciertos en el baño

En tu soledad 
Yo sé que no dejas de pensar al igual que yo 
Cuando hacíamos el amor 
Y ya todo has borrado 

En tu soledad 
Yo sé que no dejas de pensar al igual que yo 
Cuando hacíamos el amor 
Y ya todo has borrado

Tú serás para siempre 
Lo más que quiero yo 
Yo seré para ti 
Un triste recuerdo

Tú serás para siempre 
Lo más que quiero yo

Te pusieron en contra de mí 
Al que fue, no se lo voy a perdonar 

Ahora dice que no me conoce, no no no no no 
Y si me ha visto se supone que en el pasado fue

Y si me ha visto se supone que en el pasado fue 
Yo sí me acuerdo cómo lo hacíamos 
Cómo en la cama nos matábamos 

Sé que te pasas negando, todo lo que tú y yo hacíamos 
Queda en tu mente grabado todas las veces que nos desvestíamos 
Ahora me paso pensando, cómo tú puedes vivir así 
Diciendo que no sabes lo que entre sábanas tú te entregaba a mí

Solo yo, he podido llegarle 
Tu cuerpo sabe elevarse 
Y cuando tus piernas temblaban 
No decía nada ya no

Dialogando con el dinero 
No quiero interrupciones 
Esa es la prioridad 
Pasaste lista de opciones 
Estoy con la colombiana, que sepa mañana y la cubana llega a Paris

Por más que me niegues a mí, no puedes escaparte 
Si era tu luz de mi sombra y me seguías a todas partes 
Nos lograron separar, tú no quisiste escuchar 
Fue más importante qué dijo la gente, que a dónde podíamos llegar 

En el mundo de mí están hablando 
Diciendo mil cosas 
Que me ven por aquí, que me ven por allá 
Por mi vida famosa 
Tú me conoces de años atrás, sabes cómo es la cosa 
Tú sabes que yo soy real 
Te lo dije una vez

Y sé que nuestro amor es periódico de ayer 
Que tú no lo quieres leer, que ni por la calle tú me quieres ver 
Si sales de party me escuchas a mí, siempre te preguntan por mí baby 
Dime qué se siente ser el fantasma que te atormenta a ti 

Dime que pasó mami, todo iba normal 
Te hablaron de mí, te dejastes llevar 
Tu cuerpo me estaba empezando a amar 
Y por culpa de la gente, ahora te toca olvidar 

Yo sé que eres infeliz, pero te pasas mintiendo 
Fingiendo que eres feliz, mami yo no te entiendo 
Ahora él te pone a llorar, también te pone a sufrir 
Mientras yo te ponía a viajar, yo linda te hacía lucir 

Solo yo he podido llegarle 
Tu cuerpo sabe elevarse 
Y cuando tus piernas temblaban 
No me decía nada nada no no

Ahora dice que no me conoce, no no no no no

Hoy me levanté del lao' izquierdo de la cama 
(De la cama, de la cama) 
Que no quiero dramas y por eso rolo un philisito'e marihuana
Oh oh, par de minas me busqué
Joseando por la mañana
Logré comprarme mi cubana
Me compré mi carro y mi mansión en la nación americana
Nací pa' ser millo, no quiero fama

Ya me acostumbré, ya me acostumbré
A siempre ganar como el 23 
Ya me acostumbré, ya me acostumbré
A callarle la boca al que no me cree

Ya me acostumbré, ya me acostumbré
A no importarme el precio de lo que compré 
Ya me acostumbré, ya me acostumbré
A clavarme toas' estas putas de tres en tres

Ayo, déjarme contarte cómo yo lo hacía hace 15 años atrás
Me sentaba con Geezy donde cabe el kilo hasta que no quedaba más
Luego las cosas cambiaron 
Y nos pusimos a cantar
El mundo viajar, la funda a llegar
Ya no había qué bregar
No, pero si tú quiere' que te hable de droga con gusto menor yo te enseño
Conozco'los capo' y ninguno son sapos, dominican' puertorriqueño
No me llevo mucho con los empleados 
(Porque) 
Por la sencilla razón de que me crié con los dueños
Un día un pana mío un par de millones de él me puso a contar
Duré toa' la noche contando billetes y la mano me empezó a picar
Pasaron las horas y yo estaba lejos de todavía terminar
Pa' mí que eso fue una señal
Que luego me iba a tocar 

Ya me acostumbré, ya me acostumbré
A siempre ganar como el 23 
Ya me acostumbré, ya me acostumbré
A callarle la boca al que no me cree

Ya me acostumbré, ya me acostumbré
A no importarme el precio de lo que compré 
Ya me acostumbré, ya me acostumbré
A clavarme estas putas de tres en tres

Me acostumbré a que el envidioso siempre me traicione 
Y que por las botas mi nombre mencione
Yo siempre picheo en la mía tranquilo
Díselo Luian que te engancho este rabo de oro en el cuello 
Y ahora paso un kilo
Las boobies siempre estelar
Si no me crees pregunta en el banco popular
Los topos de kush nunca dan regular
Este es High Star Game y tú no vas a jugar
Dando más palos que David Ortiz
Ando con los viles loco dentro le tiro ''aquís','
