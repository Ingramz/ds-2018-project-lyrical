I didn't make it sugar, playin' by the rules
I come up hard baby, but now I'm fine
I'm checkin' trouble sugar, movin' down the line
I come up hard baby, but that's okay
'Cause trouble man, don't get in my way
I come up hard baby, I've been for real
Gonna keep movin', gonna go to town
I come up hard baby, I'm gettin' down
There's only three things that for sure
Taxes, death and trouble

This I know, baby
This I know, sugar
Girl, I ain't gon' let it sweat me, baby
Got me singin'
Yeah , yeah, whoa
I come up hard, 
I've had to fight
Take care of my business, 
With all my might
I come up hard, I had to win
Then start all over, and win again
I come up hard, but that's okay
'Cause trouble man
Don't get in my way
I know some places and I've seen some faces
I've got good connections they dig in my directions
What people say that's okay
They don't bother me 

Ready to make it, don't fool with no women
Don't care 'bout no trouble got myself together
I feel a kind of protection is all around me
This I know baby
Girl, I ain't gonna let it sweat me, baby

I know you raise Cain

Quiet, don't explain
You mixed with some dame
Skip that lipstick

You know that I love you and what love endures
All my thoughts are of you
For I'm so completely yours

Though I've loved you for a million years
And if I thought our love was ending
I'd find myself drowning in my own tears 

You are the sunshine of my life
That's why I'll always stay around
You are the apple of my eye
Forever you'll stay in my heart 

You must have known that I was lonely
Because you came to my rescue
And I know that this must be heaven

"Grover Washington, Jr.","Baby, I was just a young girl
When you came on the scene 10 years ago
I thought I was hip, I could deal with the trips
No matter how fast or slow

I was like a moving violation
Give me a ticket and I'm ready to ride
Thought I was the queen of syncopation
You know you can't give the queen no bad advice

Thought I knew it all, baby
But I didn't know it all, baby
Thought I knew it all, baby
But I didn't know it all, baby

?Cause when you kissed my lips
When you kissed my lips
I was jammin'
Jammin' for the first time

Jammin', jammin'
Jammin' for the first time
Jammin', jammin'
Jammin' for the first time

Baby, I was young, I was green
When you showed me the ropes 10 years ago
I thought I was cool, I could break all the rules
No matter how fast or slow

I was like a moving violation
Give me a ticket and I'm ready to ride
Thought I was the queen of syncopation
You know you can't give the queen no bad advice

But I didn't know it all, baby

When you kissed my lips
I was jammin'
Jammin' for the first time

Jammin', jammin'
Jammin' for the first time
Jammin', jammin'
Jammin' for the first time

I was a girl from the streets
Dancin' to the beat
Of a different kind of drummer
Little Ms. Know-it-all, you don't know it all

Caught up in the rhythm of sound
Living to get down
As the song became my lover
Attitude keeps your head up to the sky

Then you kissed my lips and, ooh
I lost my cool

Look at me I'm jammin'
And everything's happenin'
I'm feeling the bliss and the reason for this
Is the love in your kiss, baby
Jammin'

Jammin', jammin'
Jammin' for the first time
Jammin', jammin'
Jammin' for the first time

I was like a moving violation
Give me a ticket, baby
Thought I was the queen of syncopation
You know you can't give the queen no bad advice

Thought I knew it all, baby
But I didn't know it all, baby
Thought I knew it all, baby
But I didn't know it all, baby

?Cause when you kissed my lips
And my backbone slipped
I was jammin'
Jammin' for the first time

The square root of a positive groove
Times a happening melody equals a jam
Give some to the back

No
Ooh, baby
No
You got me movin' and I'm jammin' for the first time

No
Ooh, baby
No
You got me movin' and I'm jammin' for the first time

And the beauty of it all
Is when the sun comes shining through
To make those rainbows in my mind

And I want to spend some time with you

We can make it if we try
Just the two of us
Just the two of us
Building castles in the sky

We look for love no time for tears
Wasted water's all that is
And it don't make no flowers grow

Not for those who wait too late

On the window down the hall
And it becomes the morning dew

"Grover Washington, Jr.","You don't know what love is
'Til you've learned the meaning of the blues
Until you've loved a love you've had  to lose,
You don't know what love  is.

You don't know how lips hurt
Until you've kissed and had to pay the cost,
Until you've flipped your heart and you have lost,
You don't know what love is.

Do you know how a lost heart fears
At the thought of reminiscing,
And how lips that taste of tears
Lose their taste for kissing?
You don't know how hearts burn
For love that can, not live yet never dies.
Until you've faced each dawn with sleepless eyes,
You don't know what love is.",You Don't Know What Love Is,1995
"Grover Washington, Jr.","Here's another morning without you
Here's another day; will I get through it
Without breaking down?

How can I go on?
Baby, I'd be living on memories
Of you and me
All the love we made
All those tender nights
And those endless days
They're all here inside

Won't you chase my clouds away?
I'd give anything to see the sun again
Only you can stop these tears from falling
I can't face another day
Baby, can you stop
Can you stop the rain?

Ev'rywhere I go, I feel you there
Following my footsteps like a shadow
Of my broken heart
Sometimes, it's a pair of passing eyes
Or it's just the way someone is talking
And there you are

Am I all alone?
Don't you ever wake up
And reach for me
Where I used to be?
Is there any chance?
I just can't believe
You're not lonely, too
Just for me and you

Baby, I know you'd remember
'Cause loving you once wasn't time enough

On top of broken trust
The lessons that you taught me
I learned were never true

I wanna know the answers

It takes time

See the light in the distance
Open up your eyes, look, look to the sky

There's much more to life when you free
That's the key
And in time
You will find all the answers

So blow the soda bottle, let the soup cans crash

Or a clarinet or violin
But me I love the sound of dried up orange peel
When you shake it in a sardine tin
You keep your tuba give me paper tubes to play

Ven mami vive tu aventura

Una vez te escribí una canción
Y en ella te pedí que se le lograra aquel amor
Y hoy caminando por la calle por casualidad

Me contaron que aun extrañas mis caricias
Mi amor bonito y que preguntas por mí
Yo sabia que no era fácil olvidarme
Por que fui bueno y te brinde todo a ti
Por tu padre cometiste algo ignorante
No valoraste el amor que te di

(Y recibí un mensaje que quieres volver a mí)
Pero tengo que pensarlo por que me hiciste sufrir
(Y quiero que recuerde cuando hubo una ilusión)
En mi canción te pedí que se lograra este amor

Y si un día te olvida lo mucho que te ame
Con esta canción que te canta tu teenager
La que tanto cantabas y en la radio sonaba
Y aunque poco tu me amaste no creo que me has olvidado

Oye que feeling mami

Ahora te amargas cuando escuchas mis bachatas
Solo al saber que sé que cantas por el hombre que más te amó
Y dejaste que marchara de tu vida
Dime por que tu destrozaste una linda relación

(Yo sé que nunca podré olvidar a esa mujer)
Por que te ame por que te amo y sé que siempre te amare
(Hoy lloras al saber que ya no ando de tras de ti)
Y ahora tu guarda de recuerdo fotos mías y mi cds

Y si un día te olvidas lo mucho que te ame
Pon esa canción a ti te canta tu teenager
La que tanto cantabas y en la radio sonaba
Y aunque poco tu me amaste no creo que me has olvidado
Oh, um

En mi alma ya no existe la paciencia
De humillarme y esperar tanto por ti
Y aunque tal vez contigo jamás nunca vuelvas
Solo te pido muñequita, que te acuerdes de mí

Y si un día te olvidas lo mucho que te ame

Pero no llores y siente por dentro
Que duele el amor

Lo que vale un gran amor.
Entonces llorarás
Y de mí te acordarás.

Tocando en una cantina
Cuando llegaron dos compas
Que mucha feria traían

Y también unas escuadras
Por si por ay se ofrecía
Pues vamos a acomodarnos
Para empezar la parranda

Oiga amigo cantinero
Sírvanos unas heladas
Que el ambiente se ve bueno
Pa' echarnos una bailada

No se me agüite compita
Que ahora vamos a alegrarnos
Ese mi exterminador aviente
El nariz de a gramo
Y ay le va la bolsa compa
Y póngase un peri cazó

Páseme la bolsa compa
Ya que estamos en ambiente
Oiga amigo cantinero
Sírvale a toda mi gente

De lo que quieran tomar
Atiéndalos en caliente
Hay que seguir la parranda hasta
Que nos amanezca

Pues aquí traemos de todo
Por lo que se les ofrezca
Y hay que echarnos otro pase
Aquí sentaos en la mesa

Ay nos vemos camarada
Pa' el otro fin de semana
Porque el viper ta' sonando
Los güeros quieren más carga
Por ay nos tamos mirando

Cúlpame y entiérrame

Después de aquel invierno frio y largo
Después de haber vivido tanto tiempo
Tan sólo sin amar y ser amado

Así sin darme cuenta bajaba mi defensa
Y poco a poco me iba enamorando
Mi corazón abierto te iba dando
Y mientras tú eras otra de paso

Tú fuiste la llama
Que incendio el fuego de este amor
Y ahora sólo queda
El humo donde me consumo

Tú fuiste la llama que a mi vida todo ilumino
Y ahora mi mundo queda obscuro
Ahora tú me apagas la pasión
Sin una explicación
Me pierdo entre las horas del reloj

Así si darme cuenta bajaba mi defensa
Y poco a poco me iba enamorando
Mi corazón abierto te iba dando
Y mientras tú eras otra de paso

Tú fuiste la llama

Y hasta el verde en la fruta del campo
Se madura en el árbol sembrado

Y se abraza la luz de la luna
Por la paz y la buena fortuna

Compartimos el mismo cielo 
Compartimos el mismo tiempo 
Y el mismo lugar
Fuimos parte de la misma historia 
Ibamos en la misma prepa 
Yo siempre fui una lacra 
Y tu eras del cuadro de honor
 
Las piedras rodando se encuentran 
Y tu y yo algún día 
Nos habremos de encontrar 
Mientras tanto cuidate 
Y que te bendiga dios 
No hagas nada malo que no hiciera yo
Encendimos el mismo fuego 

Competimos en el mismo juego 
Compartimos el mismo amor 
Y el mismo dolor

Y el destino trazo el camino 
Para que cada quien se fuera 
Con su cada cual",Las Piedras Rodantes,2004

Y ves muy gordo al abad
Si su virgen viste de oro, desnúdala
Cómo van a silenciar al jilguero o al canario
Si no hay cárcel ni tumba para el canto libertario

Pra conhecer o seu apê

De bombeiro, encanador

Inocente, apaixonado
Eu tava crente crente
Que ia viver uma história de amor

Que cilada, desilusão
Ela me machucou
Ela abusou do meu coração

Não era amor, ôh, ôh
Não era

Van a tener que matarlo
Nomás no se arriesguen mucho
Primero hay que traicionarlo

Le mandaron un agente
Que le pidiera dinero
Le entrego veinte millones
Era el precio de su cuero
Pero como era chabuco
Lo llevaron prisionero

Junto con seis compañeros
Además dos señoritas
Los llevaron a la y griega
Era la última cita
Y ahí los acribillaron
Junto con las señoritas

Desde ese día inolvidable
No ronda tanto dinero
Y unos agentes traidores
Ahora estrenan carro nuevo
Y un hombre en Guadalajara
No duerme de puro miedo

Mis armas no las entrego
Van a quedar en el cerro
No me fió en los amigos
Que los deslumbra el dinero
Ya murió el León de la sierra
Vengan a quitarle el cuero

Aquí lo llevo en mi lista
Usted me hecho por delante
Ahí lo espero en la revista

Se molestan por que doy todo, todo para ti
Por que existirán envidiosos
Si mi dios condena la envidia
Se molestan por que doy todo, todo para ti

Yo puedo recorrer tres mil caminos
Y no hallare ninguno fascinante
Como ese día que yo pude mirarte
Que obra maravillosa me hizo dios
Te manda a mi en el momento presiso
Cuando mi vida casi no era vida
Y tan solo vivía de las mentiras
De amores que hirieron mi corazon

Y donde esta quien pueda reemplazarte
Donde esta todavía no ha nacido
Si la hay como tu semejante
No es igual prefiero estar contigo

Tu eres la única princesita

No need for greed or hunger
A brotherhood of man

Y una llama que no dejo nunca que se apague

Escampa tus dudas en mis adentros

Sino me determinan desconozco

Y te causa un gran dolor y mas dolor
Y un gran dolor y mas dolor
Y un gran dolor

Un alto en el camino quise hacer 
Un instante mi vida detener 
Una duda en la noche esclarecer. 

Para poder seguir

La mano que yo no pude extender, 
Todo eso y mucho más 
Quisiera devolver. 

Para poder seguir, 
Para poder seguir será importante 
Poner a paz y salvo mi conciencia 
El bien por encima de todo como esencia. 

Para poder seguir, 
Para poder seguir y que me atiendan, 
Seré yo luz, como faro referencia, 
Mejoraré la letra para que me entiendan. 

Para poder seguir habran razones 
Seré esclavo de todas mis convicciones 
Repartiré mi pan en iguales proporciones. 

Para poder seguir habrá un motivo, 
Que no tenga que ver nada con el olvido, 
Sin un pasado no diría que he vivido.  

Así me toque arrancar de ceros, 
Seré un hombre más pero sincero 

Pregones 

Seré como el acero, seré, seré como el hombre que da todo 
Porque se siente entero. 

Ésta es mi poesía y sigo siendo fiel a mi filosofía. 

Un libro abierto soy un libro abierto, 
Mi corazón al descubierto. 

Así me toque arrancar de ceros, 
Así me toque arrancar de nuevo.

A distinguir entre el bien why el mal

My mission for ein bichen sun
I raced with cars, the bike and the train
Only to come cold back again
I searched the roof
Through pockets,
Under beds, in the closet,
In the fridge everywhere and over all in it

One by one, undressed the big blue room

The horizontal verti-calling movements in the

Oh I wish upon a star 

On a cold grey afternoon
I catched a spot of the sun of the moon
I traveled light,
Traveled time,
Traveled thoughts.

With a glas full of stars,
I've got sunshine in my pockets
Brought it back to spray the day
And a fist full of glow

At telling maidens fortunes there's none could him excel

""Of course my dear without a doubt if you'll come upstairs with me""
""To come upstairs with you kind sir I fear I am afraid""
She spoke it in such modesty as if she was a maid

""To come upstairs with me my dear you need not be afraid

Yeah it's for the sake of Christ that I'm this way
Ever since I gave Jesus all I have yeah I just
Can't keep this fire I've got inside, well you may think
It's a bad thing you say chill out you're just a little high strung
But the way I see it if I'm only seeking God's approval
Your disapproval won't bother me at all

Cause I'm out of my mind yeah
And I'm into the mind of Christ
I refuse to conform any longer 
To the pattern of this world I'm living in 
I'm not a good little church mouse boy any longer
From now on man I'm a man of God
Well you may think it's a bad thing you say chill out your just a little high strung
But the way I see it if I'm only seeking God's approval 
Your disapproval won't bother me at all

The side effects cannot often be seen because your pockets will not turn green
Some thought that there was no vaccine, But it seems that we have a cure
Chamillitary Mayne
Get off your couch and go get it

I'm up early in the morning thinking bout getting this money
All I know is I gotta get that paper
The hustlers told me that I gotta get it, get it
Now I'm gettin it the best way I know how
I won't let you down, won't let you down 
I won't let you down

I'm up early than a mother, chasing mine cause I'm a hustler
Then tomorrow everything is gonna rewind
Only seven days a week and 24 hours a day
That ain't enough for me so I ain't wasting time
Cause only dreams come to sleepers and my life ain't getting cheaper
So you know them dollar signs, they on my mind
When they ask me where I'm goin? I say you already know
I'm bout to hit the streets and go and get what's mine, I won't let you down
Dreams of having finer things, Ridin blades and dreaming should
Make you wanna wake up and get it in real life than see the wood
In your grip, If you slip and don't grab what you see then good
Only place that you gonna be or ever see gonna be the hood

Boy that word ain't no excuse, You know what it mean to me
It means you passing over opportunities repeatedly
Write it on a piece of paper, Only thing I see is P
That paper, paper, paper chaser, better thing for me to be
Nah, my services ain't for free, make that money multiply
Early in the morning I be gone, chase with me, it ain't gonna be no tie
Try to explain and give em game, I don't know why I even try
You do the same if you was I, but you are you so you gonna lie
Make em think that you got cash, tell them ladies you got slabs
Only thing you get is laughs, You can't even bring down half
Of the bill that's on that tab, Only thing wrong with being broke
Is staying broke and making excuses bout it like there ain't no hope

I don't know how many times I gotta tell ya
In the hood, having no condition, I was having something
I remember it like it was yesterday
They was talking down on me and I lost a couple homies
I was getting mine while they used to play
They say I need to slow down but I ain't slowing down for nothing
I don't wanna let the paper get away
So when I'm in the streets grindin, ain't no need to be crying
The best way that you can help me is to pray I won't let you down
Partners that was getting lazy, Females that was acting crazy
Then promoters that tried to play me, Mixtape labels that didn't pay me
My old homies that ain't around me, Dissing rappers that came to find me
Major labels that didn't sign me, left all that nonsense behind me, I got paid

See, rich people ain't going to tell you how to get paid
And broke people act like they the richest people in the world
Always tellin people with money how to get it
Always spendin money that they thought they was gonna get.
Always buying things they can't afford.
Stop making excuses.
If chronic smoke makes him sleepy, he's gonna tell ya he got chronic fatigue
If liquor makes him drowsy, he gonna say he got that grey goose disease
If women keep taking his money, he gonna tell ya he slipped off his sleeve
Whatever your weakness, stop making excuses please
You should not be in couch or in house, you should be in route
If you gotta ask where, then that's the reason you ain't got nothing
You don't know how to listen, go get it",Won't Let You Down,2009

Engines pumping and thumping in time

Churning and burning, they yearn for the cup

Reckless and wild, they pour through the turns
Their prowess is potent and secretly stern

He's haunted by something he cannot define
Bowel-shaking earthquakes of doubt and remorse

Stealing the limelight, while we're in the wings
Sometimes the hero, must play the underdog
But I don't feel the same
I must have everything

Take me back, take me back, take me back to your heart
Can't you love me again like you did at the start?
There's a weight on my shoulders and I know I can't win
Take me back, take me back again

I would call you to plead but I don't have the nerve
'Cause the thing that I need, I do not deserve
The way I was careless with your trust was a sin
Take me back, take me back again

If my love was fire, it would burn this house down
With all of the lies that were told
But it's only a fever that burns me inside
From the longings of a broken-down soul

Now the wind's blowing through and it's crying for me
'Cause it knows I was not what I wanted to be
And the sky must be sorry, 'cuase it's starting to rain
Take me back, take me back again

If my love was fire, it would burn this house down
With all of the lies that were told
But it's only a fever that burns me inside
From the longings of a broken down soul

Guaco,"Recuerdo aquel día que entre la gente estabas tú
Mostrando tu risa y tu mirada a plena luz
Vestida de flores y con aromas de colores 
Y con la elegancia de un libro lleno de ilusiones

Y aunque no te ame a primera vista
Presenti algo especial 
Que con la inocencia de tu sonrisa me podria enamorar

Pero todo quedó quedó
Entra las sombras quedó quedó
En un pasado que no volvio
En una historia de amor que el tiempo se llevó

En el vacio de un corazón 
En la influencia de una ilusión 
En la esperanza de un sueño que nunca se nos dio

Te pienso y lamento que no estes cerca de mi
Ahora me arrepiento de lo tonto que yo fui
Si solo estuvieras a mi lado 
Te daría las cosas que antes de inocente no sabia. 

Y aunque no pude reternerte 
Hoy me siento muy feliz
Y aunque somos dos seres distantes yo siempre te tengo aquí

Si nada escucho de tu voz
De nada vale que yo

Que toma riendas de mis ganas
Y mi voz uohh

De nada vale que yo de nada vale que yo

De nada vale que yo de nada vale que yo
Para llegar a ti conozca el camino
Si tus manos ya no estan abiertas
Y tu corazon me tumba a la derecha

Que ella es todo lo que busco en una mujer

Y lo que no le gusta te lo dice en la cara, de frente?

De frente por vida siempre me pregunto
Si hubiera seguido con mi vida aquella
Me hubiera perdido el estar? con ella

Ilusiones que se encierran en los corazones
Creando emociones que son bendiciones
El milagro que aniquilan los fantasmas del pasado

Sumergida aquí en mi vida en ella te colaste
Como una bandida y yo soy tu guarida

Hay que ser idiota para no adivinar
Que cualquier otra escogencia no habría estado mal
Pero nada comparado a ella
Y pensar por un minuto la vida sin ella?

Que ella es todo lo que busco en una mujer?
Y al mirarme ella me tiene entre sus manos

Me canso

Me canso?

Me canso?
Y si no avanzo
Estaría sin rumbo, sin seguir sus huellas

Me hubiera perdido el esta con ella?
Me hubiera perdido en mi vida aquella
Y no hubiera tenido esa estrella tan bella
Ella es ahora mi rallito de luz?
Me llena de calma y me quieta la inquietud

Ella es ahora mi rallito de luz?
Me enamora su bellaza
Y me arrebata su virtud

Ella es ahora mi rallito de luz? en la sombra?
Hace que mi vida se componga

Perfecto distingo lo negro del blanco
Y en el alto cielo su fondo estrellado
Y en las multitudes el hombre que yo amo

Graba noche y dia, grillos y canarios,
Martillos, turbinas, ladridos, chubascos,
Y la voz tan tierna de mi bien amado

Me ha dado el sonido y el abecedario;
Con el las palabras que pienso y declaro:
Madre, amigo, hermano, y luz alumbrando
La ruta del alma del que estoy amando

Gracias a la vida que me ha dado tanto
Me ha dado la marcha de mis pies cansados;
Con ellos anduve ciudades y charcos,
Playas y desiertos, montanas y llanos,
Y la casa tuya, tu calle y tu patio

Gracias a la vida que me ha dado tanto
Me dio el corazon que agita su marco
Cuando miro el fruto del cerebro humano,
Cuando miro al bueno tan lejos del malo,
Cuando miro al fondo de tus ojos claros

Gracias a la vida que me ha dado tanto
Me ha dado la risa y me ha dado el llanto

Y el canto de ustedes que es mi mismo canto,
Y el canto de todos que es mi propio canto

Guana Batz,"And now, the end is near
And so I face the final curtain
My friend, I'll say it clear
I'll state my case, of which I'm certain

I've lived a life that's full
I've traveled each and every highway
Oh, and more, much more than this
I did it my way

Regrets, I've had a few
But then again, too few to mention
I did what I had to do
And saw it through without exemption

I planned each charted course
Each careful step along the byway
But more, much more than this
I did it my way

Yes, there were times, I'm sure you knew
When I bit off more than I could chew
But through it all, when there was doubt
I ate it up and spit it out
I faced it all and I stood tall
And did it my way

I've loved, I've laughed and cried
Had my fill, my share of losing
And now, as tears subside
I find it all so amusing

To think I did all that
And may I say, not in a shy way
""Oh no, oh no not me
I did it my way""

For what is a man, what has he got?
If not himself, then he has naught
To say the things he truly feels
And not the words of one who kneels
The record shows I took the blows
And did it my way

The record shows I took the blows
And did it my way",Loan Shark,1986
Guana Batz,"My head is spinning and my legs are weak
Goose step dancing, can't hear myself speak
Hope in the eyes of the ugly girls

You come here looking for the ride to glory
Go back home with a hard luck story
I can hardly wait around until the weekend comes to town

Though we are so far apart, you've got to hide your love

Don't lay your head on any other shoulder
Some hire themselves out for a good time

Looked for my baby, she's nowhere around.
Traced her footsteps down to the shore,

""I took your baby from you away.""
I heard a voice cryin' in the deep,
""Come join me baby in my Endless Sleep.""

Why did we quarrel, why did we fight?
Why did I leave her alone tonight?
That's why her footsteps ran into the sea
That's why my baby has gone from me.

There in the breakers I saw her near;
Reached for my darlin', held her to me,
Stole her away from the angry sea.

My heart cried out, ""She's mine to keep.""

Or should I call out the name of d.k.

I feel it every night wounds and licks

A tragic friendship is lost in me
Now pull the nails out of my body
The beast is a mirror
And the mirror shot me

I'm inside your crimes

And drinking another shark

Is just a trick
I smell it everywhere

A thousand friendships live in me

With a wink and a smile he'd let ya know
All kinda people come from miles around
Just to hear Johnny tell his stories
Talk about the days gone by
Talkin' bout future glory
Round round round lie goes
Tell you how the good Lord knows
He'd be shinin' most every day
Sit right down listen what he says

Some like to play with fire

Ol' Johnny pick you up when you're feelin' low
His words hang on in my memory
The dusty ol' book that he read to me
Even now I'm grown they speak to me
What gains a man to win the world
But lose his very soul
Riches of the Promised Land
Much better than silver and gold
Oh how wise is he that makes the Lord his company
Fearless of the days to come
Knowin' that the battles won

We start lionizing fools

And like the eagles we will fly

I can’t believe it’s hard just to talk to you
But you don’t understand

‘Cuz we lost it all, nothing lasts forever
I’m sorry, I can’t be perfect
Now it’s just too late and we can’t go back
I’m sorry, I can’t be perfect

Te encuentro cambiada
No me haces reproches
Ni buscas mis brazos en la madrugada

De un tiempo a la fecha
Lo vengo notando
Me matan los celos
Corroe mi alma lo que estoy pensando

Será que al dejarte sola
Encuentras un nuevo amigo
Que ocupa mi sitio
Que cruel es la duda
Es el peor enemigo

Será que al dejarte sola
Cuando me encuentro ausente
Tienes un amigo que ocupa tu vida
Que ocupa tu mente

La gente rumorea un asunto importante
La gente rumorea, la gente rumorea
La gente rumorea que alguien del pueblo
Está estrenando amante

De un tiempo a la fecha
Te encuentro cambiado
Será que a tu ausencia
Y a tu indiferencia
Me había acostumbrado

De un tiempo a la fecha
Me estoy preguntando
Será que me amas
O es solo tu orgullo
Que estoy lastimando

Será que al dejarte sola
Encuentras un nuevo amigo

Guardians of Dalliance,"I emerge with a dirge, I'll speak until my death rattle
There's a war outside the blackboard jungle prepare for battle
Those who sleep the American dream will wake tonight
From the words I recite, shedding light with what I write

Second amendment needs amending, not a basic human right
Can't agree with what I see, it's an idiot's delight
When all injuns wanna wear the headdress
But can we convalesce the students strike to a recess

Change a little late now
That your face is down and bloodied
By my one triggered mind
Hate, enslaved to live down
Chamber's loaded I am ready
Shots sound out my cry

As apparent, you're so transparent, you don't care
It's just like you're not even there
Taking steps in reverse but it's too late to rescind
I shall finish the game and reap the whirlwind

Dead finger on the pulse of this nation, no pulsation
Firearms are growing faster than the population
Armed like octopi, preoccupied with bereavement
Growing old's become the new benchmark of our achievement

Every metropolis has turned to a necropolis
Disarm the nuclear family, stifle the rifle not the populous
Relationships are hollow as an empty casing
Time is racing, a brick wall is what we're facing

Change a little late now
That your face is down and bloodied
By my one triggered mind
Hate, enslaved to live down
Chamber's loaded I am ready
Shots sound out my cry

As apparent, you're so transparent, you don't care
It's just like you're not even there
Taking steps in reverse but it's too late to rescind
I shall finish the game and reap the whirlwind

As apparent, you're so transparent, you don't care
It's just like you're not even there
Taking steps in reverse but it's too late to rescind
I shall finish the game and reap the whirlwind

Bring that shit back
Take your life back
Back, back, back
We won't take that fuck that

As apparent, you're so transparent, you don't care
It's just like you're not even there
Taking steps in reverse but it's too late to rescind

We can stay up all night like vampires

In the last minute I done thought about you 10 times
Fine on the out but she pretty on the inside
And every since she left its like my heart died

Baby I think you can bring out Gucci's other side
She said how you don't you trust me you did a homicide
Then said I got a boyfriend who I can't put aside
Even though the grass so much greener on the other side
And every man like what he can't have
It's funny but I came at
Baby girl so bad, dis me but I ain't mad
Now you wanna tease me
You should wanna squeeze me
Homie ain't the kid, baby he could never be me

How you wanna go and act anti-social
Bet your man don't know you like I know you soldier
Maybe one day babe you gon' get your mind right
And if you looking for me you can find me in the lam

Baby you don't have to treat me all anti (Why)

And every since she left its like my heart died

Oh Damn
Once upon a time a long time ago
I had a bitch but she felt she had to let me go
Called me out cause she cant buy cheap shit
Yeah you got talent but I'm a bad bitch
Now when I see her shorty whole swag switched
I walk right by her like she don't exist
Her car broke down and it can't get fixed
Her swag broke down and her bag counterfeit
Oh Damn!
Dats not Gucci, baby that's floochy
Remember 2000 you was acting all boozie
9 years later and you're best friend choosie (muah)
I scooped her in my phantom and I took her to the movies (yeah)
Damn

Gucci don't gotta act anti
Told her she can have me when she want
That's when she fantasized that I can't talk to her cause I got that man pride
Ever since I left baby girl told me her heart died (Gucci!)

Oh Damn!

Excuse me if I sound a little crazy
But just wanna be good to my baby
Cause he been holding me down
He give me everything I don't need no one around
But you're saying you can give it to me better
Give me hot like it's July and I'm rockin' a sweater
Just for hitting the road
Would you women let go
Say you got 20/20
Her man's 2004
Maybe I'll give you a try
And keep it low
Let you ride
Something like a test drive
See baby I ain't so anti

I saw this pretty young lady that was real, real fine
I tapped her on the shoulder and said, ?Mmm, mmm, excuse me, ma'am?
She pulled down her pants and said, ?Splack these hands?

Whoa?oh?oh?oh?
Sally ?That Girl?
Whoa?oh?oh?oh?
Sally, whew, ?That Girl?

So we walked her to her house, as she opened up the door
It was heart-shaped bed in the middle of the floor
She pushed me on the bed and this you can bet
In between her legs was real, real wet
So I grabbed her by her thighs and I moved up truly
She jumped off the bed and said, ?Don't touch my booty?
?Don't touch my booty ?cause I won't touch you?
?Don't touch my booty ?cause it's not the thing to do?

The Rollie on my wrist, it cost a Porsche, don't it?
And I'ma let you get this dick, just give me one moment
One night only, I'll never leave you lonely
And baby, you can call me, but only when you're horny
Pull up in the evening, then fuck you 'til the morning
And we don't need no reason, just call me when you need me
I'm the King, don't play for Cleveland
I'll bless you like you're sneezing
Gucci Mane so freaky, I'll fuck you while you're bleeding
Tricking, not deceiving, and I'm tricking like I'm treating
I love it when she tease me, but hate it when she leaving

I'm in the zone they keep on gettin' offended 
But ain't did nothing wrong 
But tightened up all my business 
And now I'm making millions, 
Everybody's social 
They really too emotional 
I don't have time to hold 'em 
I wanna be a billionaire, me too 
So I can count a B cashing hundreds on you to 
I get dirty money bitches know with Ciroc on my rida' 
On the stage gettin' with Diddy Nicki Ricky Roze and Flo Rida 
I rock Maris with the money ball like Stoudemire Omare 
Hold a blunt with my left hand to show my automall is Paris 
Look at all that I've accomplished, 
I just bought me three Ferrari's 
Spent five million in my company 
If I offended you not sorry, Gucci

[Chorus]
What it gonna be 
What it ain't gonna be 
Too many chains on me too many rings on me 
Baby dancin' on me diamonds dancing on me 
Tell my watch and my rocks not to freeze 
What it gonna be 
What it ain't gonna be 
Don't dare anybody here to put their hands on me 
Too many stacks on me too many rights on me 
Got some killa and some gats and money

Gotta die on my life as what its gonna be be 

I'ma street magician 
And I keep on taking pretty girls to Lenox 
New mustang with 80 in it 
Watch her spend all 80 in 80 minutes 
Sacks are full real true religion 
I bought a car so sharp it make you feel suspicious 
See I'm too flamboyant 
They say its malnutritious 
I'm in a rare edition, 
Think I'm a mathematician 
Don't nobody in here put their hands on me 
Too many stacks on me too many rights on me 
Gotta die on my life as whats it gonna be 
Whatcha gonna do Gucci ain't gonna leave 
Still poppin' bottles pouring liquor on chicks 
No need to lie I'm such a freak 
No need to hide you so unique 
I'ma try beat your back down 'til you weep 
Said you ran outta money there's more for me 
Here's more for you cause you a whore for me 
Don't be a hoe for free 
Cause we can ball right now 
We can do it 2, 3, 4 times a week 
From zone 6 down to Camelton 
I pull up in that yellow thing 
I put rims on everything 
Hoes think I gotta wedding ring 

What it gonna be 
What it ain't gonna be 
Too many chains on me too many rings on me 
Baby dancin' on me diamonds dancing on me

Come in to leave throwin' money high 
Don't care where it reach 
Spend 2 G's a week on haircuts 
Like 4, 5, 6 sometimes a week 
These girls petrified they scared to speak 
I'm in the new gt with a Georgia peach 
Gotta condo right out on the Florida beach 
I ain't hard to reach so nice to meet 
Every night we meet you prolly fight with me 
Say its fine with me to spend the night with me 
No rules everything alright with me 
Now shake baby shake just right for me 
Catch ball players in magic city 
Show them boys how good my jumper is 
Ain't no niggas no lies to tell, 
Makin' all pros look like amateurs 
I just showed my ass last night I had a blast 
My jewelery was so bright haters put theirs in the trash 
Pulled up in somethin' fast just to make them haters mad 
Rims with paper tag paper bag full of cash 

What it gonna be 
What it ain't gonna be 
Too many chains on me too many rings on me 
Baby dancin' on me diamonds dancing on me

Lay up in ya yard, rob ya when ya go to church
Ya love white tees now ya face on the shirt

Verse 2:
(ughh0
I use to be the nigga wit the dimes, now I'm on the grind wit the 4's and the 9's.
They say it's Gucci time to shine, a young black entrepreneur in his prime
A nigga got a get the whole thing, 19.5 every time my phone rang
I got so much clientele, black tee, black Gat and a pocket scale
So I can't go broke man, niggas know me as the Dope man's dope man
I made this one for my folks man, for the J's that be smoking outta coke cans
And they asking for a wake up, you wanna a brick I gotcha covered like make-up.
So want you holla at you boy, you drop a couple dollars, I'll get your coke, I'll get your boy

[Chorus]

I got them pounds and the Q.P.'s, I move units, I ain't talking bout cd's
I'm talking bout HB's, a hundred pounds nigga holla at HB
Nigga I can get an Escalade off a hundred slab and a razor blade
When I cut it wit the rich band 2 flips nigga I'ma be a rich man.
And these robbers trying to plot up, get his car shot up trying take a nigga product
These niggas ain't harming me,plus I sell more drugs than a pharmacy.
I'ma mix it wit the Isatol, ten thousand pills and these bitches ain't no Tylenol 
Big nuts like bowling balls, 30 though and dollar charm and a hole in the wall.

Young Gucci Man, don't kiss me baby you can kiss my chain 
Ya gotta be a dime piece,

Got a gold grill but it's not from Eddie

Gucci Mane,"*Talking In The Background*

Uh
The streets of my city be gritty
Young niggaz pack plenty, and ain't never show no pity
Many die on streets of concrete, blasted from the heat
From under the seat, niggaz just tryin' to make ends meat
Trying to eat, day to day livin' with no religion
Luxury cars, and this money got my full attention
School teachers and the preachers don't know what to teach us
They don't get a second look without them ghetto features
Created so the non pigmentated rated
Pornographic caught they children learn the words and say it
Save the monsters, but don't nobody know the lord
Status depends on the baddest shit you can afford
And look at me I'm in the middle of the confusion
Crime in my blood and I need a transfusion
Take it how you want to take it
I gotta twist and break it
Make it shine to distinguish from the ones who fake it
and if it comes out raw, and uncontrollable
Money's foldable, fuck a hip-hop quoteable
Nobody felt what I was feeling when I wrote this shit
Broke this shit, but that ain't new so I can cope with this
Hope it get better for those who don't get a chance
To advance, and dig the shit I be saying
You know what might make what I say a little clearer
If mothafuckers judge the one they see in the mirror

But I'm in the lunch line with a honor roll
You pumping iron in the weight room 
I'm on the grind got a nine in the weight room
And I never play softball 
But I always kept the hard and the soft balls
You doing math on the calculator 
I'm weighing slabs doing math on a calculator
And I ain't trying to to write no essays 
I'm trying to to get a hundred pounds for my eses
You trying to learn how ta speak Spanish 
But my connect trying to teach me ta speak Spanish
And u a monitor in the hallway 
I'm all day on the grind wit a 4-way

[Chorus]

You the one who won the spelling bee 
I'm the first 3rd grader wit a felony
And I never was a teacher's pet 
I'm the one who went and stole the teacher's cigarettes
And I never went on field trips 
I'm at walter's trying to buy me some stash slips
And I always been cut throat 
15 taking big niggas starter coats
Laflare entertainment by myself 
But I used to have a high right, low left
Gettin' money by da truck loads 
Rollin up big fat el productos
Before I drank v.s.o.p. remy
I used to drank that MD 22
Wood-grain and reverse 8's
Box Chevy trunk sounding like a earthquake

[Chorus]

I gotta give it to u raw man 
Cause I still keep a trunk full of raw
I'm a nigga from the block man 
In the club putting down wit the block man
You probably gotta worker 9 to 5 
I'm on the grind with the nines for the 55
Bitch u a half of a 12 
Low key bucket trying to duck 12's
So what's up with them t-shirts 
I got a t-shirt tuck under my t-shirt
Better watch yo fucking tone man 
Cause you know Gucci keep a tone man

And a blue Bent' Coupe same color as the Crips
Mean mug on my face, nigga, ain't nothin' funny

Pass that bubble thrax and put this bean on your tongue
Now everything was gravy til your bitch came in
Bout the same time that that thing kicked in
Now she ain't really pretty but she got a nice body
I'm geeked up thinking this Buffie The Body
Ain't your name lil' Trina cause you look like Janet Jackson
I'm off three double stacks and I'm looking for that action
Gucci Mane you stupid man I love the way you flowing
Riding in my drop but I don't know where I'm going
On two eighty five I keep riding in a circle
The inside of my ride smelling like a pound of purple
Gucci is your time give me five more minutes and a cold 
orange juice cause I'm really really trippin'
Went to the strip club and request that I'm the man
The next thing you know I was throwing rubber bands

Is you rolling

Yeah!

Shorty telling me she ain't never suck no dick
Neva took a pill or never ate a bitch
You a lie but I ain't gonna get upset right now
But I wish I had a lie detector test right now
You say you marry well bitch you might be
But I bet your husband ain't Icy like me
She stand on B.C. in my ashy black tee
When them dope man Nike's and them jore ass jeans
I don't pay her but I still keep that thrax on me
I'ma the shit in East Atlanta baby ask about me
Pop one pop two two halves that's three
Ain't no waffle house baby hell I cant eat

Wearing Doces in the club cause you know the boy geeked
Top the top on that thing let you see my seats

So tell me when to go like my name E-40

Got a party pack of pillz that's at least bout 40
Ill pour them in your hand like a bag of jelly beans

He said lets go to the movies, I told him lets go to the room
This nigga think he really got a freak, but mine is do the fool
We get to the room, I let him rub,I let him get a lil' touch
I told him hold up stop, let me go to the bathroom freshen up

Kicked in the do', shot him in his head, took his cheese and left him murked
