The Manhattan Transfer,"Have yourself a merry little Christmas
Let your heart be light
From now on, our troubles will be out of sight
Have yourself a merry little Christmas
Make the Yuletide gay
From now on, our troubles will be miles away
Here we are as in olden days
Happy golden days of yore
Faithful friends who are dear to us
Gather near to us once more
Through the years we all will be together
If the fates allow
So hang a shining star upon the highest bough
And have yourself a merry little Christmas now
 
Have yourself a merry little Christmas
Let your heart be light
From now on, our troubles will be out of sight
Have yourself a merry little Christmas
Make the Yuletide gay

From now on, our troubles will be miles away
Here we are as in olden days
Happy golden days of yore
Faithful friends who are dear to us

The Manhattan Transfer,"It came upon the midnight clear
That glorious song of old
From Angels playing near the earth
To touch their harps of gold

Peace on the earth could will two men
From Heaven's all-gracious King
The world in solemn stillness lay
To hear the Angels sing

And I hear them singing
Sing, I do hear them singing

The first Noel the Angel did say
Was to certain poor shepherds in fields as they lay
In fields where they lay, they keeping their sheep
On a cold winter's night that was so deep",It Came Upon a Midnight Clear,1992
The Manhattan Transfer,"I just came back from a lovely trip along the Milky Way
Stopped off at the North Pole to spend a holiday
I called on dear old Santa Claus
To see what I could see
He took me to his workshop 
And told his plans to me, so
 
[Chorus]
You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
He's making a list and checking it twice
Gonna find out who's naughty and nice
Santa Claus is comin' to town
He sees you when you're sleepin'
He knows when you're a wake
He knows if you've been bad or good
So be good for goodness sake
Oh! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
 
With little tin horns and little toy drums
Rooty toot toots and rummy tum tums
Santa Claus is comin' to town
And curly head dolls that toddle and coo
Elephants, boats, and kiddie cars too
Santa Claus is comin' to town
Then kids in Girl and Boy land will have a jubilee
They're gonna build a Toyland all around the Christmas tree
So! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
 
Now Santa is a busy man, He has no time to play
He's got millions of stockings to fill on Christmas day
You'd better write your letter now
And mail it right away
Because he's getting ready
His reindeer's and his sleigh. So

The Manhattan Transfer,"Now, Smackwater Jack,
He bought a shotgun
'Cause he was in the mood
For a little confrontation.
He just a-let it all hang loose;
He didn't think about the noose.
He couldn't take no more abuse
So he shot down the congregation.

You can't talk to a man
With a shotgun in his hand.

Now, Big Jim the chief
Stood for law and order.
He called for the guard to come
And surround the border.
Now, from his bulldog mouth,
As he led the posse south,
Came the cry, ""We got to ride
To clean up the streets
For our wives and our daughters!""

You can't talk to a man
When he don't wanna understand.
No, no, no, no, no.

The account of the capture
Wasn't in the papers,
But you know, they hanged ol' Smack right then
Instead of later.
You know, the people were quite pleased
'Cause the outlaw had been seized
And on the whole, it was a very good year
For the undertaker.

You know, you know, you can't talk to a man
With a shotgun in his hand.
A shotgun in his hand.
Smackwater Jack bought a shotgun.
Yeah, Smackwater Jack bought a shotgun.
Oh, Smackwater Jack, yeah.
Talkin' 'bout Smackwater Jack, yeah.
Talkin' 'bout a-Smackwater Jack, now.
Talkin' 'bout Smack.

The Manhattan Transfer,"Every time I think that I'm the only one who's lonely
Someone calls on me
And every now and then, I spend my time at rhyme
And verse and curse those faults in me
But then Along Comes Mary, and does she wanna
Give me kicks and be my steady chick
And give me pick of memories
Or maybe rather gather tales from all the fails and
Tribulations no one ever sees

When we met, I was sure out to lunch
Now my empty cup tastes as sweet as the punch

When vague desire is the fire in the eyes of chicks
Whose sickness is in the games they play-
And when the masquerade is played and neighbor
Folks make jokes about who is most to blame today
And the along comes mary and does she wanna
Set them free
And make them see realities from which she
Got her name
And will they struggle much when told that such a
Tender touch
Of hers will make them not the same

When we met, I was sure out to lunch
Now my empty cup tastes as sweet as the punch

Oh here she comes along, along she comes
Oh Mary comes along, oh here she comes
Ba ba ba 
Ba ba ba
Sweet as the punch

Then when the morning of the warning's passed, the
Gassed and
Flaccid kids are flung across the stars
The psychodramas and the traumas gone, the songs
Are left unsung
And hung upon the scars
And the along comes mary 
And does she wanna
See the stains
The dead remains of all the pains she sent the night
Before
Or will their waking eyes reflect the lies and make
Them realize their urgent
Cries for sight no more

When we met, I was sure out to lunch
Now my empty cup tastes as sweet as the punch

But only for one night with no repeat.
And maybe you'll go away and never call,
And a taste of honey is worse that none at all.
Oh little girl!

In that case I don't want nobody
I do believe that that would only break my heart
Oh, but if you feel like lovin' me
If you got the notion,
I second that emotion.
So, if you feel like giving me a lifetime of devotion
I second that emotion.

Maybe you'll think that love will tie you down
And you don't have the time to hang around.
Or maybe you'll think that love will make us fools,
And so it makes you wise to break the rules.

The Manhattan Transfer,"The jam is jumpin'
The drums are pumpin'
The groove is lockin' in the rhythm like we want it to be

No time for stallin'
We're really haulin'
We've gotta keep it in the pocket or we'll stagger behind

You never know just when to leave it when you're riffin' in time
Or if the time itself will falter, or of words even rhyme
But we admit, the trick to it is not to think about it
When you're busy bravin' all the notes in the line

This time we mean it
We're gonna swing it
And take you right up to the end before we try to unwind

I've never been the kind of guy who could just normally quit
Never could decide when to rest my pride
And feel all right with just good enough
Thoughts, they gather
Tellin' me to look to find a bright new way
To assemble all the stimulated motives that haunt me
Tryin' a live it, be in the moment, tryin' to sing it alone
Can beckon to me, a feelin' of being bent
So I believe, takin' a leave is the brightest way to stop
All the chatter boxin' going 'round in my brain
So I'm wailin' - movin' and groovin' this part of this song
I hope that my riff's good enough to keep
Better leave it now or go out of my mind

Now I dig you think that perfect's what we should make it
But I've been down that road and I can tell ya how we feel's
The most important thing about it
Whether you're right or whether you might think
We're pathetic
A little lighter on the reins will help you loosen up the chains
That are still binding you -
In the past, whenever thoughts I had would try to re-
Evaluate all that I would do
I'd hesitate, consolidate, and motivate
All the little pearls of doubt that strive to break up
Every single bit of
Precious joy that flowed from God's soul spark that
Shines within me
That's it in a nut shell
So take advice from this sap, go for feel and leave it alone

Now's the time to sing
Swing is what we bring
Rhythm that's the thing
To really get your spirit movin' higher

Gonna jump and play
Dance the night away
Make you really sway
And let the music take you even higher

E-lla sang this song real special
Come on, come on - we'll sing this special song for you

One more one we'll go
But before we blow
We want you to know
The take is really good enough, we'll keep it

I'm gonna paint a sepia panorama
So full of life the painting will come alive
Bathed in blues 'n full of drama
An' all the swing they needed so they'd survive
I'll add some tans an' yellow ocher
Such soul! So full of rhythm
An' then some orange t' tone up the black a bit
My goal is to be with 'em
Purple haze t' lull the smoker
What swing! What syncopation
An cherry red t' loosen the back a bit
That thing captured a nation

An' then a mere patina of subtle green
Get down with me - you'll dig my study in brown
To lighten up the purple n' tone it down
Get down with me - tell about it all over town
A dancing glow to highlight the subtle scene

The Manhattan Transfer,"Once a mockingbird (dig) - he was overheard (what)
-singing out a word (I) - to a cattle heard: (heard)

""All you bovine creatures - dig what I'm layin' down!""

All you sinners drop everything

Don't be silent - Let the Lord hear y'shout

And jus' let the music come out

Sing you sinners woncha sway n' swing

In a world where there's no music

(He's up to his tricks)
He'll be laughing up and down the banks
(Hee, hee, hee)

You can rave
It's apparent that you have misbehaved
To your grave
But if you should wanna be saved
Jus' behave
Take a listen now to the bird...

Janis' solo:
Stop all that chewin' yer cud - and all that standin' in the mud there
Swing people! Swing every chortle from yer mortal portal
I dig that everyone believes that all cattle prodigies
are like a sneeze
Hard blowin'-missin one lick of blowin' talent to show

(If y'sing - y' gotta swing!)

But remember that the day will come when you 
will be just steak on a plate
(Folks, y'know it's fate)
So dig the music of the swing-o-sphere -
(before your swing arrives too late)

Janis' solo, continued:
That's a little too dark
Still, it's true - we've got breath for such a limited time
What are ya, stupid, ya cows?? - you'd think to sing was a crime

In defense now; hence now; Here's comes Adele McCluck:

Cheryl's solo:
Mrs. Mockingbird, I must say you haven't heard
the friendly bellowing swing of our friends the cows - 
as they shed their way from Teagarden to Fuller
Instead of spendin' ev'ry day jus' sneakin' around
to life another lick -
These cats work on their cow-tone, so when they get up to blow
They blow a fatter bone-tone into the ozone

(And furthermore...)

Alan's solo:
You tweety-birds are always singin' away
Never givin' up thought of what you say
We cows do - shedding takes up most of our day
So when we start and settle in to play - we can say
A moo is an array of what we've always known to be
the best and only way to play

(What we mean to say is...)

Before the band will letcha sing
(Sing with Fletcher Henderson)
You've got to get y'self to swing
(Like the Bean or Satch)
So your horn can blow - a single note or two
of deeper thinking
(That's the way to swing)
So set your mind upon a tone
(When you're shedding all alone)
And you will have a cornerstone
(Like the bass trombone)
Blow your horn and take a bow
So that you're swinging like the cows
Pythagoras would be so proud of us

The Manhattan Transfer,"Gather roun' 'n hear my story
Oh boy
'Bout the time when Jelly Roll was in town
(Stompin' it off, stompin' it off)
He heard a local pianist

What joy
Stompin' out music on an old upright piano
Here comes King
That was downright ragged in a Scott Joplin way
(Here he comes, master of the stomp)

Ol' Jelly knew the fella could play
Dig him
By the things he heard his right hand say
(Now, we're gonna romp)
(There was no doubtin' that the man could swing)

When Jelly Roll demanded his name
Hail, King Porter
Well, the man responded ""Porter King""
(Dig 'I'm)

By order
Well, Jelly lef' th' city, but he wrote
(Dig I'm)
Why' wanna dig I'm

A rompin' ditty 'bout the Porter
(Dig I'm)
Why' gonna dig I'm
Who was ""King O' The Stomp""
Porter King sho' can stomp

Jelly wrote a ditty 'bout a fella who could romp
This is the tune ""King Porter Stomp""

When Porter's stridin' hands are flyin'
An' all his fingers are testifyin'
His two feet stompin' in ragged time
That's a feelin' that is so sublime why' dig it?

He's generatin' so much excitement
Why' keep forgettin' just what uptight meant
N' that's that fella named Porter King
His style's the essence o' swing
(Well, well, well)
Oh, well, go on n' tell it

When Jelly first heard Porter King
He declared he heard the very heart an' soul of swing
A certain ragged kind o' romp
In between a jump and a stomp

When Jelly heard, well, he really knew
Because he played too
That Porter was a King, really n' truly a stone king
Another thing, somethin' never heard of

""Somethin' else"" is the sort o' phrase
A fella'd prob'ly have t'use
If'e was gonna describe
The way Porter plays

There never was an never's gonna be
Another strider fine as he
I know no other ear will ever hear another like it here

Who you hunchin'?
Dig them stompin'
See them bunchin'
They rompn'

Sweat is poppin'
Hips're rollin'
Funk is droppin'
Souls soulin'

Heat is massin'
Folks're swingin'
Time is passin'
Arms flingin'

There's contagion
Takin' over
Swing is ragin'
All over

Hey, stop that
That stomp knocked me outta my hat
Who's that abusin' piano?
Tell me his name, because he's boun' f' fame

'N how'd he figure such rhythm?
Did he bring it here with I'm?
What kinda cat is King Porter?
Plinkin' an' plunkin' that romp he calls a stomp

Everybody groovin' and gigglin'
Mercy, take a look at that wigglin'
See the cutie in the corner
She's losin' her blues by stompin' outta her shoes

The folks are hoopin' n' hoppin'
Dig how all the fingers're poppin'
Over there's a wild cat stone drunk
The floor be his bunk

Stomp, stomp, stomp, stomp
Just keep on ballin' till we
Start fallin' right through the floor

It's so natch'ral
You want more?
Come git it

Porter, he's the King
He knows how to stomp an' swing
That's King Porter
Master of how to stomp

Outside the moon is beamin'
Inside the joint is steamin'
Them folks can really, really party
All night long

Porter's stompin'
Gits everybody rompin'
Then everybody knows that one thing
Porter's king

Who's the absolute master of stomp?
King Porter
The rollicking Rajah of Romp?
King Porter

The plinkin'est plunker
This side o' the border?
Who? Except King Porter

Who is the King of the keys?
King Porter
An' constantly able to please?
King Porter
An' who tickles ivories like nobody livin'?
That's King Porter, he's the man

You never know just when to leave it when you're riffin' in time
Or if the time itself will falter, or of words even rhyme
But we admit, the trick to it is not to think about it
when you're busy bravin' all the notes in the line

I've never been the kind of guy who could just normally quit
Never could decide when to rest my pride

Thoughts, they gather
tellin' me to look to find a bright new way
to assemble all the stimulated motives that haunt me
tryin' a live it, be in the moment, tryin' to sing it alone
can beckon to me, a feelin' of being bent
so I believe, takin' a leave is the brightest way to stop
All the chatter boxin' going 'round in my brain
so I'm wailin' - movin' and groovin' this part of this song

But I've been down that road and I can tell ya how we feel's
the most important thing about it
Whether you're right or whether you might think 
we're pathetic
A little lighter on the reins will help you loosen up the chains
that are still binding you -
In the past, whenever thoughts I had would try to re-
evaluate all that i would do
I'd hesitate, consolidate, and motivate
All the little pearls of doubt that strive to break up 
every single bit of 
precious joy that flowed from God's soul spark that
shines within me
That's it in a nut shell
So take advice from this sap, go for feel and leave it alone

This strange illusion takes over me
Through a tunnel of the mind
Perhaps a present or future time oh, oh
Out of nowhere comes this sound
This melody that keeps spinning 'round & 'round

Hearin' the twilight
Hearin' the twilight tone

Saw the future through her third eye
People came with skepticism
Picking, testing her precision, no, wo, oh, oh
Suddenly they heard this sound
This melody that keeps spinning 'round & 'round

Through the mystic unknown zone

Hearin' the twilight
Twilight swept away, feelin' the rhythm
Hearin' the twilight
Twilight swept away, ba da, loo da, ba da loo da

To take a trip into oddness and obsolescene, through a 
Zone whose boundaries are that of imagination.
Accompanying him on this journey is the mesmerizing 
Sound of the Twilight Tone.

On a cold & rainy night
One Mister Miller had a rare flight
Glen was up there boppin' a rhythm
Then the engine stopped to listen with him
Play that beat, oh, oh
Suddenly he heard this sound
This melody that keeps spinning 'round & 'round
Now he resides and plays trombone
In the mystic unknown zone

Feelin' tomorrow like I feel today
If I'm feelin' tomorrow like I feel today
I'll pack my truck and make my give-a-way

St. Louis woman with her diamond ring
Pulls that man around by her, if it wasn't for her and her
That man I love would have gone nowhere, nowhere

No excuse for my behaviour
Friday to Sunday that's three days gone
I just touched base and saw my neighbours
First thing they asked is how the rave was
Living life like I'm rich and famous
But I just spunked every penny of my wages
Packed lunch ting everyday next week
'Til the end of the month I'm on Sainsbury's basics
I got missed calls I should've picked up
Or maybe I shouldn't 'cause I was pissed up
Sent a few texts I regret so I need another drink
Just to look through my inbox
Staring at a screen tryna process nonsense
Can't smoke through my self-made problems
Every memory I made well it's long gone
But I'll be back next week for my swan song

'Cause it's all down to the love, down to the love
Down to the love of the raving
Put it all down to the love, down to the love

Down, down, down to the love of the raving

'Cause we both had the usual out the noodle
Babe, I've missed ya, it's been brutal
Don't you love me, how can I show ya?
Love, I love ya, how can I have ya?
You disappeared like abracadabra
Right outside of the O2 Arena
Then came back like abracadabra
Got me thinking I might still need ya
Babe, just kiss me, fuck me, I missed ya
You don't shout me, you don't either
If not me then why did you leave her?
Why did you go get a brand new geezer?
I think I know
If you say I don't think you go
If you do I don't think you will
Either way I don't think you know

When we first met I was a younger, you put me under
Within the first ten minutes, I loved ya
Weekend thing, three-day fling
Found myself in the deep end now swim
Seeing you on Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday
Halloween, Christmas Eve and my birthday
You give me all my best and my worst days
You taught me all of my best and my worst ways
You've seen me fight, you've seen me get nicked
You've seen me get pie, you've seen me get chicks
Been there when I've given up felt like a loser
Been with me to celebrate and toast to the future
And then we sober up again
Mistakes we'll make 'em all again
There will be memories in the end
At least we made 'em with good friends

I wrote a song about you
Saturday you met me
Sunday I love ya
I don't know what I'm gonna do
I wrote a song about us
Friday I need ya
Monday ya hate me

You see, I was born and raised in the slums of the city,
It was a one room shack that slept ten other children besides me.
We hardly had enough food or room to sleep.
It was hard times,
Needed something to ease my troubled mind.

He disrespected mama, and treated us like dirt.

Listen one more time I'm doin' fine, up here on cloud nine.
Folks down there tell me,
They say, ""give yourself a chance son, don't let life pass you by"".
But the world of reality is a rat race where only the strongest survive,
It's a dog eat dog world, and that ain't no lie.
Listen!  it ain't even safe no more to walk the streets at night,

Up in the book of life.

Endure forever more.

well did you know the pen,
Is stronger than the knife.
And they can kill ya once,
But they can't kill ya twice.
Did you know distruction of the flesh is not the ending to life,
Fear not of the anti-christ.
Did you know that I,
Exist before the earth.
And did you know my eyes,
Are windows to the world.
Did you know you can't go ah Zion and ah wear jerry curls,
Can't tell di boys from di girls.
Your body's just a vehicle,
Transporting your soul.
It's what's inside the people,
Is beauty to behold.
Fear not of evil.

It grow old.

Take a toll.

Somethin' got to give.
The system is the problem,
But it ain't just gonna change.
The people got to fight as one,
To break free from the chains.
We livin in a time,
Where whitey got us cornered.
Shackles on the brain,
Police on every corner.
Lookin for some soldiers,
But they so hard to find.

'cause things come in time.

not fast enough because yo,
They wanna rewrite me history.

Raise it up.
Push it up.

Till I heard an orchestra play.
I met you when lights were bright,
and people were carefree and gay.
You were the beautiful lady in blue.
I was in Heaven just dancing with you.
You filled me with strange delight,
and softly you strolled away.
 
I dream of that night with you,
lady when first we met.
We danced in a world of blue.
How can my heart forget.
Blue were your eyes,
and blue were the skies.

Perspired the trophy shelves made room for his collapse

In her baron womb mirror

With their mandible tongues 
Set crucified fires to petrified homes

And the owls they were watching 
And the owls did't care

Placenta in their stares 

They will feed on all the carnage 
Leftover from the flood

Or fold your punctured proof

And there's nothing you can do

Only rows of crows 
Defrocking every breath 

And one day you'll remember 
Behind the melting cones

Gestated in his bed
Mingle with the carnivores you've something both in common now
Till one day his wasted breath
Swollen throat and karma debt
Set foot inside a parlor, to find her drunken by receipts
He held her by the ankles
Gutted at the nave, yes gutted and depraves
He tied a rope around her legs
And let her hang for seven days

They want a bouquet of black rose gems
Cascading kisses stalactite stems
They went and built a capsule in the cyanide pond

The Mars Volta,"Tell me it's over
Rusbel awaits
I've been to the surface
And nothing is there
Eyelids sank muffled
In the nerve aura sound
But when she awakes
Will she still be with us

My heart is darkclots
Leap year is late
How did you get here
Ask all but the bait
From a christ that went hissing
Constricting his cells
We summon by candle by book and by bell

Glossolalia coats my skin
Glycerin and turbulence
Stuffed the voice inside of God
Mirrors to the animals

The sermon goes mourning
Pricking it's hail
Slothful the child
That preys on the seed
Shall behead the drough
Wound under sleeves
I hope you have room
In a thicket of vines

Give me a moment
To clean what you've stole
The streets will hang high
Stretch ribs and let taste
We'll cover the smell with silver nitrate
Mending the cuts of your prosthetic faith

Stuffed the voice inside of God

Then so long
Dear mnemonic
Assume the form
You've given me and I'll spill

Now hold on
Just hold my hand
Say that they made you
But you brought your own leash
Tell me no more no
Say I'm the last one
Outside
By the drift
You read my will
Of thread and itch
Failure to comply
As failure to decease
And still you won't know everything
I've built the fall

Sulking drained the fall of my pale will
Swarming by your steps
Licking the ankles of blasphemer guilts
It only meant to drape a plastic
Over the stuck pig scalp of head
To cover the sock where the flatline had spread
The kiosk in my temporal lobe
Is shaped like rosalyn carter
She says my map is home again
But torn face down
I have only but a million blemishes
To tell you all about
In the end they just gagged me
To make him come out

Gas me the hind
Of your five legged snare
Tooth picks the eye
But no things there
Down drags your waltz
Cross the alter top
From a sleep that
Depravation knew
Trespass your form
I'm void of dusk
I'd ask to look
But the mask stays on

You'll levitate
Teutonic print
Cruelty is the wrath
Of my instrument

In the end they just gagged me
To make him come out

You locked the cuffs
Arsenic erupts
Will you drink the shadow
Of my red hair

You and your false
Witness to God
You've one in the chamber
But your finger got stuck

Let slip the sound
Of a cry for help
But all was lost
On the night you walked

Palms speak through eyes
Serve your memory lost
I contaminate with insignias

In the end they just gagged me
To make him come out

I won't forget a face that left me

Just you wait
Till I get my hands on you
I can't
You won't remember

And let it thaw
In the eye of the needle
I can't get out

They'll check my wrist
I'll faint a pulse
I'm not the human

You'd scratch that itch
When you asked for safe passage
On my shoulders where we slid
And just before you laid
Dead weight upon its shores
I stung you in the face
For that's the nature of my core

Because
I got distance
Don't let it close
Gotta let me know
You just gotta let me know

Because
Forget which way
Is out now
Gotta let me know
You just gotta let me know

It's unforgivable
It knows that I am visible
I'm broken mirrors
And useless prayer
This lock is healing me
You know you came so willingly
Waiting is a vessel
That will take me to
Love, it knows no order
When you taste the truth
Because
I'm trapped in this cement husk
Gotta let me go
You just gotta let me go

Because
I paid with own touch now
I bought a little cut
There is blood for every month
In the way you used to
Call her wicked answers

I'm broken mirrors
And useless prayer
This lock is healing me
You know you came so willingly
There burns a kiss with serpent scales
There is no miracle
I lost your miracle

I wrap myself around
Your buried questions
Through blisters of confinement
I seek to drain
This broken shelter
To refill the pigment case
That I have left

Don't stay long
For teeth nurse
The first wound
Coats revolve
Hope to gain
What if we find
What tongue ties double Windsor
Invoke to no reply
Those that lie
Have froze
At the border
No implies
Close the frame
What if we find
The sunlight draws a curtain
Invoke to no reply
There's a place
Where this
Depth charge ignites
Where the soul has no purpose
I can't believe you
When your thirst won't let me go
I am the moment you were always speaking of
Because there's no fence will hold
The sentient culprit fall about it
Say where I can enter them
Culprit fell about it
One fell, the other taste won't lie

How many cave into the pressure I apply
If you take this breath of mine",Agadez,2008

What have you brought for my appetite?

I'll never perish with the albino horns of a thousand young born.
Will you drink to the depths of my seed?
And your arms will break
If you touch this fence
Praise them to this life comes to end.

What have you brought for my appetite?

Maybe maybe maybe maybe maybe maybe maybe they've got to open wide, got to open wide.

Am I living or am I dead?
Do what thou will tell them what I found

Corrosive I became
Where a scarlet bruise grows
Sprout the fault we own

I got a pain inside that'll rip through the very fabric of time
Cause I've been with you before god gave me sin
I've got to get born
Just so you know there's too many reasons

You set the silver down to guard me from the weak
You check the spelling for nothing

Where am I now
That the music has faded

And I'm nowhere near the place

But I'm drawing closer to the present
And I'll find a space with no memories

I'm blinded by heaven

If the liars that blink are bound by the sender
Trinkets you gave have all rusted down

We came rewinding when
I foamed at the mouth while the lights winked at me
And now my shape is kept
The rain it can't hide, wash the pain from this hex
Is it so permanent?
Did she catch a left eye when it blinks three times
Or once just to seal you in
In your drunken breath did it stain like us
In place of poison heat
I gotta rid this world of your intention
Swap the corpse in the casket

Give me that corpse please
The one that tore nightly
I really want it now
Fold the arms slowly
Don't want you to hold me
It fits just like a glove
Does he make you feel alright?

When I seep inside your truth through suspicious little coughs
You sank your nails inside a key while the door you shut closed up
The black stockings you kept smell of wet cigarette
Torn of lust that you could not keep
I have slept inside your fault to have you keep me hear on this leash
For the rest of your pets I will feed to this theft
As we consummate the vows of defeat
And when you pray for an end to this I do believe this is eternity

In a pocket full of drink that I have drunk
Spit the remnants in your direction
This is the closest to any kingdom that you will come

I'm starting to feel a miscarriage coming on
It's numbing a stump clearing in my throat
And I just can't lose grip of it

I'm all out of pulse but I know you can resuscitate me

Define the puncture, when will I know to,
I found something to shake by the roots,
I come along to see what's in your room,
The Coma's spending time to answer you,
I need something laid out for him,

Am I waiting now,
Does my waiting howl,
Am I waiting now?
Does my waiting howl.

I bring an avalanche of taunted bones,
Contaminate your cravings if you choose,


To pray something then extra will spill
Whom after me form out a content high,
Inhale the vapors that will heal your smile,
Hope for something to shake by the roots.

Am I waiting now,
Does my waiting howl,
Am I waiting now,
Does my waiting howl.

Won't you bury me
In the sunshine?
Please let me know
That you're still mine.
Though I'm gone,
My love for you
Is, oh, so strong.

Let me know
You still love me.

Above me.

Will always grow.

Maybe we waited a little too late

Ain't no mistakin' my heart is breakin'

About the way you been doin' me
Never thought it'd end this way
Guess I was too blind to see

Ain't no mistakin' my heart is breakin'
Ain't to my choosin'
That I'm losin' - losin' you

I've got the blues.........
And there's one thing I'll always know
A woman can be such a bad thing
Makes a man feel so low

Ain't no denyin' you been lyin'
Ain't no mistakin' my heart is breakin'
Ain't to my choosin'
That I'm losin' - losin' you

About the life you're supposed to live
All the sins you've done
The good Lord will forgive

Maybe I'm wrong
Nobody knows for sure
But I live my life the old gospel way

Well I guess, I'll soon be dying
Just like a river, somewhere it stops to flow

I just tell them my Jesus, told me so

He's got the best beagle dog in the county I've been told
But his shotgun done got too rusty
That 'ole beagle dog he done grown a little too old
As he stares up into heaven, I'm sure I know the reason why
He's thinking about that promised land in them Blue Ridge Mountain skies

Loves all his brothers
Treats his elders with respect

What a cold hard life that I've known 
But my love still glows like the city below 
Because of all the love she's shown

Takin' me where I really want to go

Heard it in a love song
Heard it in a love song
Can't be wrong

I'm gona be leavin' at the break of dawn 
Wish you could come but I don't need no woman taggin' along
So I'll sneak out that door couldn't stand to see you cry
I'd stay another year if I saw a tear drop in your eye

Heard it in a love song
Heard it in a love song
Heard it in a love song
Can't be wrong

I never had a damn thing but what I had 
I had to leave it behind
You're the hardest thing I ever tried to get off my mind
Always something greener on the other side of that hill
I was born a wrangler and a rambler and I guess I always will

The Marshall Tucker Band,"ASKING TOO MUCH OF YOU
(Toy Caldwell)

If I ask you to tell me about the man
You been seen with most everyday

If I ask you to tell me
Why you're never at home
When I call you in the middle of the day

And when I ask you to tell me only the truth
That ain't asking too much of you

If I ask you to tell me
Why you got someone to keep the kids
That Saturday I was gone

And I ask you to tell me
Why that same Saturday night
It seems you forgot to come home

Chorus

All I'd like to know is if you still care
And I don't think the question
I'm asking is by no means unfair
If I ask you to tell me about the man
You been seen with most everyday

And if I ask you to tell me
Why you're never at home
When I call you in the middle of the day

When I ask you tell me only the truth
That ain't asking too much of you

The Marshall Tucker Band,"CHANGE IS GONNA COME
(Tommy Caldwell)

There was a time I dreamed about money
Was a day I feared growing old
Many times have come
When I'm thinking 'bout you, honey
And if you leave me girl
I got nowhere to go

Cause I know, yes, I know
A change is gonna come someday

Do you remember a long, long time ago
You would follow me
All the time
And everywhere I go?

Now I find myself a pot of gold
Living on another name
And what I got to know
Is it still the same?

Cause I know, yes, I know
A change is gonna come someday




",Change Is Gonna Come,1978
The Marshall Tucker Band,"DREAM LOVER
(Jerry Eubanks, George McCorkle)

Was a time when friends of mine said
Love was just a game
Find a girl and give her a whirl, then
Move on, all the same

But I was never happy
Always searching for this one
The dream to be my lover
And the dream she'd give me a son

I've searched this whole world over
'Bout a hundred times or more
Always looking for a girl I could love
Forever more

Dream lady, sexy Sadie, oh, I've dreamed
All my life of you
Dream lover, there's no other, oh girl
You could make all my dreams come true

CHORUS

Dream lover, oh, where are you?
If I could find you I'd love you true
Dream lover you're in my mind
Oh, lord, why does love have to be so unkind?

But I found a girl with loving
One to share my hopes and dreams
A friend to stand beside me
And the lover of my dreams

CHORUS

(Jerry Eubanks, Doug Gray, George McCorkle)

Listening for a faint sound
Gazing out the window I see
Winds blowing clouds
Wish they were taking me
A lonesome song on the radio
Reminds me of where I'd like to be

CHORUS

Everybody needs somebody
To help them make it through life
Arms to hold, words to soothe
Someone to say that it's all right

Too many miles of road, I really can't complain
These LONELY hotel rooms are driving me insane
My life's a hard life, wouldn't have it any other way
Someday darling, I'll be coming home to stay

It can take it's toll on any kind of man

This is something all new to me
My heart's feeling something all new inside

Somehow in my heart I hope I do
Just by knowing it's me and it's really you

(Toy Caldwell)

Lord it seems, my whole life
Ain't been nothing but trouble
When I try to straighten things out
Hell, things double
Ever since I met you I'm doing what a man's supposed to do
About love

A lot of folks think that love is wrong
And they don't know what's going on
Ever since the day they told me your name
This old heart of mine has been under lock and chain
Of love

I always knew that you made the sun shine
I never thought I'd see the day I'd make you mine
And I'll always be singing rhymes
I'll always be writing lines
About love

Don't want you to think
I'm coming on a little too strong
Just wanna let you know
Ain't nothing going wrong

And everything I ever tried to do
Lord, it just comes right back to you
I guess that's what love's supposed to do
I'll always be singing rhymes
I'll always be writing lines

",Singing Rhymes,1978
The Marshall Tucker Band,"In the corner of dark bar room
Sat an ole' cowboy singin' western tunes
Singin' songs he learned as a child
All about the West back when it was wild
He said he came from down Texas way
The cowboys were tough
The women the same way
Said he was a star back in '31
Hollywood had liked him for some songs that he had done

He's the last of the singin' cowboys
Singin' songs of inspiration and joy
Yippie Yi Yo, Yippie Ay Aye
He took a break, just to chug him down a beer
C'mon folks holler out the songs you'd like to hear
If I know one, I know a million tunes
I'm not up here playin' for me
This is all just for you
And then he bragged on the Stinson hat that he wore
Said it was the finest made since the war
And he won the silver buckle ridin' on a cow
And as he laughed he said
I'll bet you're wonderin' how?

He's the last of the singin' cowboys
Singin' songs of inspiration and joy
Yippie Yi Yo, Yippie Ay A ye

And after three hours or maybe more
A lady grabbed his arm
And showed him to the door
The bartender said, ""he's blind, you see
Don't tell him the only audience he had was you and me""

But come and fly with me
Through life's many fantasies

A place we could live for evermore
So let's search wide and far
For that mountain or that shooting star

And I was tought to judge men equal and not to find their faults
Until one day I witnessed a tragic thing
The men lay on the church steps, slain
And when the smoke cleared a tall man holstered his gun
The bright day ended and a cloud did cover the sun
I found hate in my heart that I'd never known before
I'll see this man hang and if that's the one thing that I know for sure

Silverado you'll hang by the hangman's tree
And you'll die in misery

His face remained in my eyes as I grew through the years
I practiced shooting every day while trying to hold back the tears
I travelled through Oklahoma and Texas to the Rio Grande
Knowing when I met Silverado the Lord would steady my hand

Silverado you'll hang by the hangman's tree
And you'll die in misery

Then the day came I dreamed of for years
Silverado stood before me and my heart it pounded in fear
As he turned and saw my eyes he knew why I'd come
And without a flick of the eyes he went for his gun
And as I caused a fight tears come to my eyes
When he collapsed before me I dropped my gun an sighed

Like a prairie breeze
A good stout horse between my knees
Just bein' alone just bein' me

And when I die let me die
With a dream in my mind
A smile on my face and no trouble behind
And no cross on my grave 
To show my restin' place

The Marshall Tucker Band,"We were riding through the flatlands
We were searching for two prisoner
Who just broke jail
A tall one and a lean one
Rode a chestnut stallion
And the word was that the main man
Well he was mean as hell

An outlaw is a man
Who never understands
A word called danger
He learns to shoot and ride as a child
And to never trust a stranger
And he's always called a better man

We chased him to the border
All the way to El Paso
The ride was long, the ride was hard
But the sheriff said we can't let 'em go
He said let me tell you something
I've been tracking for a long time
They never trust a stranger
And they take care of their own

An outlaw is a man
Who never understands
A word called danger
He learns to shoot and ride as a child
And to never trust a stranger
And he's always called a better man

Today's man is an outlaw
On that long road to freedom
You work him to take his pride
And then you try to cheat him
Then one day you figure out
It's a long long story
An outlaw is a man who takes care of his own

An outlaw is a man
Who never understands
A word called danger
He learns to shoot and ride as a child
And to never trust a stranger
And he's always called a better man

When a woman acts the way you do, well somewhere ya have to draw the line.

Empty liquor bottles, and crowded bar rooms, seems to be your home.
Now that I know the way you feel for me, I guess it's time for me to move on.

I have tried everything, to make you see my way.
But now I'm tired of being made a fool, I believe it's time I had my say, aw ya.

I've got a canepole in my hand
I've got my redworms in a Maxwell house coffee can
I'm gonna sit under ashade tree on a riverbank where it's cool
I'm gonna close my eyes and dream and let the cork Bob away my blues

Well I wake up every mornin' I pick peaches all day
And on Saturday night we'll have a dance or two we might waller in the hay
Now the only thing that ever whipped my pa
Was this bad dude called old age
And his last years was his best years
And this is what he had to say

He said boy I've worked this dirt all my life but things ain't been good for awhile
Why don't you move to the city make a little money you might be the first one in
The family ever to die with a smile
Well I took his advice things goin' well
But my friends are far and few
But whoever said a city boy can't have the country blues
Whoever said a city boy can't have the country blues

Well honey they ain't talked to me and you

And there's fire on the mountain
Lightening in the air
Gold in them hills and it's waiting for me there

We were digging and shifting from five to five
Selling everything we found just to stay alive
Gold flowed free like the whiskey in the bars

And Satan was the star

And there's fire on the mountain
Lightening in the air

Tears flow free for her man she couldn't save
Shot down in cold blood by a gun that carried fame
All for a useless and no good worthless claim

You'll probably get stuck, ya don't know where ya are
As you stomp your feet to a country guitar

You can have fun I'm tellin' you can
When you stomp your feet to a hillbilly band

I grab me a lady and I dose E doe
Ain't nuthin' in this world I'd rather do

The Martins,"The marketplace is empty,
No more traffic in the streets,
All the builders' tools are silent,
No more time to harvest wheat,
Busy housewives cease their labors,
In the courtroom no debate,
Work on earth is all suspended
As the King comes thro' the gate.

O the King is coming,
The King is coming!
I just heard the trumpets sounding,
And now His face I see,
O the King is coming,
The King is coming!
Praise God, He's coming for me!

Happy faces line the hallways,
Those whose lives have been redeemed,
Broken homes that He has mended,
Those from prison He has freed,
Little children and the aged
Hand in hand stand all aglow,
Who were crippled, broken, ruined,
Clad in garments white as snow.

O the King is coming,
The King is coming!
I just heard the trumpets sounding,
And now His face I see,
O the King is coming,
The King is coming!
Praise God, He's coming for me!

I can hear the chariots rumble,
I can see the marching throng,
The flurry of God's trumpets
Spells the end of sin and wrong:
Regal robes are now unfolding,
Heaven's grandstand's all in place,
Heaven's choir now assembled,
Start to sing ""Amazing Grace!""

O the King is coming,
The King is coming!

And now His face I see,

The King is coming!

The Martins,"This old world gets you down
When you're doing too much looking
At the sin and sorrow going 'round
Don't it make you wanna cry?

Well, I cried some myself
And I learned a little lesson
How to set my sights on something else

I wouldn't tell you no lie, I wouldn't lie to you
I can worry and pout in the shadow of doubt
But I'm running out of reasons why

Because God's good, so good
He is absolutely, positively, definitely
Nothin' but good to me and you

On my baddest bad day
On my deepest dark night
I know that everything is gonna be alright
Because God's good

When it's hard when it hurts
When it's getting so confusing
You don't even know which came first
Was it clouds or rain?

He is strong when we're not
He's forgiving when we stumble
Never ending love, no matter what
And He ain't fixing to change

You say, ""Is He aware and does He even care?""
I say, ""Yes, He is and yes, He does""

Because God's good, so good
He is absolutely, positively, definitely
Nothin' but good to me and you

On my baddest bad day
On my deepest dark night
I know that everything is gonna be alright
Because God's good

Let me hide myself in Thee;
Let the water and the blood,
From Thy wounded side which flowed,
Be of sin the double cure,
Save from wrath and make me pure. 
Not the labor of my hands
Can fulfill Thy law's demands;
Could my zeal no respite know,
Could my tears forever flow,
All for sin could not atone;
Thou must save, and Thou alone. 
Nothing in my hand I bring,
Simply to Thy cross I cling;
Naked, come to Thee for dress;
Helpless, look to Thee for grace;
Foul, I to the fountain fly;
Wash me, Savior, or I die.

When my eyes shall close in death,
When I rise to worlds unknown,
And behold Thee on Thy throne,

I think about a night
When the earth smelled of summer

was sleeping on a hill

There are new lovers now
on the same silent hill
Looking on the same blue sea
And I know Tom and I
are a part of them all
And they're all a part of Tom and me

Hello Young lovers whoever you are
I hope your troubles are few
All my good wishes go with you tonight
I've been in love like you

Be brave, young lovers, and follow your star
Be brave and faithful and true
Cling very close to each other tonight
I've been in love like you

I know how it feels to have wings on your heels
And to fly down a street in a trance
You fly down a street on a chance that you'll meet
And you meet not really by chance

Don't cry young lovers whatever you do
Don't cry because I'm alone
All of my memories happy tonight

I've had a love of my own like yours
I've had a love of my own","Hello, Young Lovers",1960

Life was serene, I knew where I was at
""There's no hope for him,"" my dearest friends would mutter
I was something dragged in by the cat. Then

Just in time, I found you just in time
Before you came my time was running low
I was lost, the losing dice were tossed
My bridges all were crossed, nowhere to go

And there is no one waiting there for you
Then it's a lonely town, you wander up and down
The crowds rush by, a million faces pass before your eyes

Still it's a lonely town unless there's love
A love that's shining like a harbor light
You're lost in the night unless there's love

Too hot to handle
Stars in the night
Blazing their light
Can't hold a candle
To your razzle-dazzle

You've got me flyin' high and wide
On a magic carpet ride
Full of butterflies inside
Wanna cry, wanna croon
Wanna laugh like a loon

Are there lilac trees in the heart of town?
Can you hear a lark in any other part of town?
Does enchantment pour out of every door?
No, it's just on the street where you live

And oh, the towering feeling just to know somehow you are near
The overpowering feeling that any second you may suddenly appear

People stop and stare, they don't bother me

Can be here on the street where you live",On the Street Where You Live,1960

Honey, here's the way it's goin' to be:
You will set behind a team of snow white horses,
In the slickest gig you ever see!

Chicks and ducks and geese better scurry
When I take you out in the surrey,
When I take you out in the surrey with the fringe on top!
Watch that fringe and see how it flutters
When I drive them high steppin' strutters.
Nosey pokes'll peek thru' their shutters and their eyes will pop!

The wheels are yeller, the upholstery's brown,
The dashboard's genuine leather,
With isinglass curtains y' can roll right down,
In case there's a change in the weather.
Two bright sidelight's winkin' and blinkin',
Ain't no finer rig I'm a-thinkin'
You c'n keep your rig if you're thinkin' 'at I'd keer to swap
Fer that shiny, little surrey with the fringe on the top! Did you say 

The fringe was made of silk
Wouldn't have no other kind but silk
Does it really have a team of snow white horses
One's like snow, the other's more like milk

All the world'll fly in a flurry
When I take you out in the surrey,
When I take you out in the surrey with the fringe on top!
When we hit that road, hell fer leather,
Cats and dogs'll dance in the heather,
Birds and frogs'll sing all together and the toads will hop!

The wind'll whistle as we rattle along,
The cows'll moo in the clover,
The river will ripple out a whispered song,
And whisper it over and over

Don't you wishty'd go on forever?
Don't you wishty'd go on forever?
Don't you wishty'd go on forever and ud never stop
In that shiny, little surrey with the fringe on the top!

I can see the stars gettin' blurry,
When we drive back home in the surrey,
Drivin' slowly home in the surrey with the fringe on top!

I can feel the day gettin' older,
Feel a sleepy head on my shoulder,
Noddin', droopin' close to my shoulder, till it falls kerplop!

The sun is swimmin' on the rim of a hill,
The moon is takin' a header,
And jist as I'm thinkin' all the earth is still,
A lark'll wake up in the medder.
Hush, you bird, my baby's a-sleepin'!

Maybe got a dream worth a-keepin'
Whoa! you team, and jist keep a-creepin' at a slow clip clop.

I want a ticket, just for one
He said
Well, if you insist
But where you wanna go, a miss?

Destination anywhere
East or west, I don't care
You see my baby don't want me no more
This old world, ain't got no back door

He looked at me with a funny face and said
Are you sure you wanna go just anyplace?
I said, If you ever loved someone, the way I loved that man
Surely Mr. ticket agent, you could understand

Destination anywhere
East or west, I don't care
You see my baby don't want me no more
This old world ain't got no back door

'Cause if it did, it would swing both ways
And we'd go on back to happy yesterdays
When he loved me tenderly
And all he needed was me

I thought I heard my baby call my name
But it was just the conductor saying
Which stop would you prefer?

Into each heart some tears must fall

No use crying forever

And every word is true
Don't waste your time on a fella
Who doesn't love you
He'll only mislead you
Only grieve you
Don't worry about him
Do without him
Because there's too many fish in the sea
Too many fish in the sea
I said, there's short ones, tall ones, fine ones, kind ones
Too many fish in the sea

Bait your hook and keep on trying
Don't let him get you down
There's other boys around
Because there's too many fish in the sea
Too many fish in the sea
I said, there's short ones, tall ones, fine ones, kind ones
Too many fish in the sea

With two training wheels tightly 
Holding yourself as you break into the day.

Far from reflections of youth,

I'd like to see you sailing high like a kite, 
With no strings holding you tightly, 
As you float above where you would never stray, 
But now you're gone and you're far away, 
Far from every birds eyes view, 
Of when you were caged (it's a shame) 

So what about your princess? (So what about your princess?)

We're all fade towards the dawn

No, you were never scared

Its time to let the explosions in my heart
Leave me out to meet you in the end

It can make your heart stop
It can make your heart stop
It can make your heart stop

And it will make your heart stop

And candle lights on little corner tables

The beauty that is Spring's

How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me

Silk stockings thrown aside dance invitations

Wild strawb'ries only seven francs a kilo

The song that Crosby sings

Wanna laugh like a loon

That when your love wears golden earrings,

By the burning fire,they will glow with ev'ry coal.

Make love your guiding light,
And let that pair of golden earrings
Cast their spell tonight.",Golden Earrings,2017

Called life in the fast lane.

On a street corner, singing for a penny a song.

And the ladies are whores.

Yet nothing is true.
Well, perhaps you can change
What the cards always read,
For the children who never forget.

For a time they were counting
You out of this race.
You stood up like a champion
That had fallen like grace;
Never showing the anguish
That had covered your face.

Left to die in disgrace;
Shot down by a gun of a runaway train;
Called life in the fast lane.

My way back home,

I found myself alone.

I may never find another one so true.
Maybe I'll just never find another you.

[Chorus]
Forever lonely, forever blue,
Forever knowing that you were true,
Forever thinking you'd love me too.
So you've gone, and now I don't
Know what to do.
So I guess I'll always be forever blue.

Will you be so kind as to leave
My heart alone?
That's where it needs to be so
It won't hurt no more.
As long as you're around and
Not here with me,
My smile will be a frown, and
Forever blue I'll be.

I may never find another one to hold me.
I may never find another one so true.
Maybe I'll just find myself all
Sad and lonely.
Maybe I'll just never find another you.",Forever Blue,1992
The Mavericks,"For thirty years they sang the song of promised victory
But who they've fought and who has won
Didn't matter much to me
I see them driving down the streets
In their fancy shiny cars
Crowds of people to their feet
Their faces full of scars

No pleasantries, no luxuries
No little children's mild
While minister's wives spent all their lives
In China's finest silk
My back's been broken many times
But my spirit lingers on
The day it comes my way on freedom's ship
I will be gone

From hell to paradise
I'll always pay the price
From hell to paradise
I'll always pay the price

This ninety mile trip has taken thirty years to make
They tried to keep forever what was never theirs to take
I cursed and scratched the Devil's hand
As he stood in front of me 
One last drag for his big cigar
And he finally set me free

From hell to paradise
I'll always pay the price
From hell to paradise
I'll always pay the price

From hell to paradise
I'll always pay the price
From hell to paradise
I'll always pay the price

Are you lonesome tonight?
Do you miss me tonight?
Are you sorry
We drifted apart?
Does your memory stray
To a brightest summer day
When I kissed you
And called you sweetheart?

Do the chairs in your parlor
Seem empty and bare?
Do you gaze up at your doorstep
And do you picture me there?
Is your heart filled with pain
Shall I come back again
Tell me dear
Are you lonesome tonight

Do the chairs in your parlor
Seem empty and bare
Do you gaze up at your doorstep
And do you picture me there?
Is your heart filled with pain
Shall I come back again, come back again
Tell me dear
Are you lonesome tonight
Tell me dear
Are you lonesome tonight



",Are You Lonesome Tonight?,1998
The Mavericks,"You'll never know
I'll never tell
I've learned to hide
My feelings well
But my heart beats fast
When it hears your name
And you'll always be
My secret flame

You've got someone
Who holds your heart
To say anything
Would not be smart
But my love for you
Will never change
And you'll always be
My secret flame
I have this dream
Of me and you
I pray someday, someway
It will come true

So I'll trust in time
You'll feel the same
And then you'll be
My secret flame

",All I Get,1998
The Mavericks,"I want to go across the river
To the house on oldway road
Where my life began and ended all the same
I remember Chris and Johnny, childhood friends of mine
Who grew wise enough to learn to play the game
As i walked up to the front yard
There were children playing there
And i thought someday this may be my home again
But how soon i learned my lesson
Through the windows they threw stones
And said there's nothing left inside Mr. Jones

I went next door to ask the neighbour
If they knew what happened here
To the place where all my memories remain
As they recalled and tried to answer
Tears rolled down their eyes
But the best reply they had was made in vain

Seems the folks that used to live there
Worked hard for all their means
But their means could never take them to an end
There was hope down in the city
Then a bank declined their loan
Now there's nothing left inside, Mr. Jones

Chorus

Can't you see that it's empty now
And no one really cares
For even i must try to save my own
You should turn around and get back on that
Lonely oldway road
'Cause there's nothing left inside, Mr. Jones

Repeat Chorus

I'm going back across the river
To see if i can find
The place where life can start and end all the same
But no matter where i'm going it will dwell inside my bones
That there's nothing left inside, Mr. Jones
No there's nothing left inside Mr. Jones

She's got a four lane highway
Running through the middle of my soul

But it really doesn't matter
Cause I love her anyway

She says she loves me
Whenever someone mentions my name
And though I've never heard her
I know it's true just the same
Well her friends are all crazy
Man they're always around
And maybe it's just as well

I treated you bad

Don't you know I sit around
With my head hanging down
And I wonder who's loving you

Oooh, my first mistake was
I wanted too much time
I had to have him morning, noon, and night
If I would of known then
The things that I know now
I might not have lost the time I complain about

Is not the hearts you break
It's bound to good love you make
When it's heart's on fire
Give him love evryday
Remember he needs space
Be patient and he'll give his heart to you

Hold on to your love

Hang on tight

Just keep on

You're gonna get a lesson he'll learn you well
Back off and stay away from him
Outside you're going down
And how ya gonna feel when you hit the ground?
The bad seed is at it again
The boy is so defiant
Angry young lion
With too much hatred from the past
All his aggression
It isn't helping him become a man

Na na na na na na nothing
Is ever gonna change him
Yeah and it might take a little
Bit to get used to
But he'll stay broken

Out back behind the shed
That's where his daddy thought him to hate the best
The education of the heavy hand
The blows were handed down
And it never did much good for him to cry out loud
The fragile child never stood a chance
Hey just remember this

It's the greatest gift of all

The Mayfield Four,"Lyla in bloom
Her innocence and youth stripped away
Eighteen years old
But she's lived the life of sixty-eight
The heartache of a mother gone
And father she's never known
So she dreams of a better place
Scared and alone
Turning tricks and getting stoned to survive
Vegas sex queen
Living in a world that's so obscene in a dead end life
At the end of every tragic day she says this to herself
If I can hold on I know

When I find my wings
I'll fly away
Over the mountains
Over the pain
And I won't look back
Cause I've gotta get away from here
I've gotta get away from here",Lyla,2001
The Mayfield Four,"I saw her in an empty bar
The smell of wine and cheap cigars
Trigger visions of her face to this day
We tried to dance for years to come
But two can't lead and waltz as one
We loved and learned
And learned to love
But it was not enough
Foolish pride got in our way

She could take my heart and soul
She could take my hand to hold
But why'd she have to take advantage of me
I tried to pay for all the things
She could want or ever need
Don't make me pay for all the past please

So now we're living far apart
I hope to god our paths don't cross
This may seem shallow..but her beauty makes me weak
I long to hold her once again
And reconcile and then give in
To realize that later on we made the same mistake
Hold on to the lessons you've learned

She could take my heart and soul
She could take my hand to hold
But why'd she have to take advantage of me
I tried to pay for all the things
She could want or ever need
Don't make me pay for all the past
So much to tow
Bogged down with all the history to hold
The blame fell hard on me
Apologies were too short lived
She never really could forgive mistakes
She took my heart
She took my soul
She took my fragile hand to hold
She took advantage all the time
I'll take her back cause her love makes me blind",Mars Hotel,2001

Clip my wings this angel's falling down
Sick, sick, sick, and wrong
Let's go, let's feel, let's fuck around
Sick, sick, sick, and wrong

Your guilt, it never tires, it wants to bring down Babylon
Your want, desire, your urge is way too strong,
It's never safe,
When we're together,
A supernova when we collide,
I start to shake,
I start to tremble,
I lose control when i come inside

All alone in the house we call home
And the walls still echo of her laughter
We'd dream of a world far away we'll never know
Since she left, I don't dream anymore

The MC Bat Commander,"Billy built a robot in his parent's garage
Because he had a list of problems that he needed to solve
He said, ""I'm sick of the Hills, Laguna Beach is fake and whack
Let's party like it's '96 and bring the horn section back""

Back before Gwen Stefani started rapping with Pharrell
Gas cost one fifteen and Goldfinger could sell
When reality TV wasn't scripted or contrived
The brass was phat and bumpin' and the beats were all played live

See, Billy was obsessed with third wave ska
The Mighty Bosstones, Reel Big Fish, Less Than Jake
He'd seen them all
He longed for a time when even Bill Clinton played the sax
On the white house lawn and kids wore shades and checkered slacks

So Billy sits back in the class and labs
Put a notebook on his lap 'cause he plans a task
To make a giant robot, how's that?
And bring the real Orange County back

This gigantic robot kills
He's gonna come down the block, he's gonna fire at will
He's got a cannon on his shoulder and a laser in his hand
He's gonna win the day for Billy, make the city understand

The robot was completed and it opened up its eyes
Weighing seven hundred pounds and standing eight foot five
With his black coat, white shoes, black hat, set to attack
The robot headed to the hills to give those spoiled kids a smack

Christoph Leary got knocked flat as Billy bumped the Aquabats
He ripped out Mischa Barton's spine to crank Save Ferris and Sublime
He burnt down Heidi Montag's home and to blast the OC Supertones
His scream was smashing LC's head, ska is not dead

This gigantic robot kills
He's gonna come down the block, he's gonna fire at will
He's blasting bullets from his elbows, shooting missiles from his eyes
He's gonna win the day for Billy, take the OC by surprise

He'll make you do the Macarena as you rock your Tamagachi
With your Newton down in Woodstock playing Sega la-di-da-di
He brought the 90's back and then he freed Tibet
If you can't find his jam on Napster then the warehouse sells cassettes
(Old school)

Gigantic
(He was)
Gigantic

Gigantic

Than an Irish man who worked an honest day

Along the dusty road he'd travel
Fifteen miles to get there, fifteen miles to go
Fifteen miles back home again, home to Steamboat Row.

He used to tell about the time he got hurt down in the mine
He said he'd never go back down again
But in his heart he knew he would, he did the only thing he could
Kept on walkin' down that road
Fifteen miles to get there, fifteen miles to go
Fifteen miles back home again, home to Steamboat Row.

That his days were quickly coming to an end

I set out to get you with a fine tooth comb
I was soft inside there was something going on

You do something to me that I can't explain
Hold me closer and I feel no pain every beat of my heart
We got something going on

All this love we feel needs no conversation
We ride it together, uh huh

Sail away with me to another world
And we rely on each other, uh huh

Everything is nothing if you got no one
And you did walk in the night
Slowly losin' sight of the real thing

But that won't happen to us and we got no doubt
Too deep in love and we got no way out
And the message is clear this could be the year for the real thing

No more will you cry, baby I will hurt you never

Were searching for a diff'rent tune
One that they could croon 
As only they can

They only had the rhythm so
They started swaying to and fro
They didn't know just what they had
And that is how the blues really began

They heard the breeze in the trees
Singing weird melodies
And they made that 
The start of the blues

And from a jail came the wail
Of a down hearted frail
And they played that 
As part of the blues

From a whippoorwill out on a hill
They took a new note
Pushed it through a horn
'til it was born into a blue note

And then they nursed it, rehearsed it

That the southland 
Gave birth to the blues!",Birth of the Blues,1999

The Mediam,"This is me

We are young, heartache to heartache we stand
No promises, no demands love is a battlefield
Woah, we are strong, no one can tell us we're wrong
Searching our hearts for so long, both of us knowing
Love is a battlefield

You're making me to go, you're begging me stay
Why do you hurt me so bad?
It would help me to know
Do I stand in your way, or am I the best thing you've had?
Believe me, believe me, I can't tell you why
But I'm trapped by your love, and I'm chained to your side

We are young, heartache to heartache we stand
No promises, no demands love is a battlefield
We are strong, no one can tell us we're wrong
Searching our hearts for so long, both of us knowing
Love is a battlefield

And if I'm losing control will you turn me away or touch me deep inside?
And before this gets old, will it still feel the same?
There's no way this could die
But if we get much closer, I could lose control
And if your heart surrenders, you'll need me to hold

We are young, heartache to heartache we stand
No promises, no demands love is a battlefield
We are strong, no one can tell us we're wrong
Searching our hearts for so long, both of us knowing
Love is a battlefield

We are young, heartache to heartache we stand
No promises, no demands love is a battlefield
We are strong, no one can tell us we're wrong
Searching our hearts for so long, both of us knowing

Love will come to you.

By the burning fire,they will glow with ev'ry coal.
You will hear desire whisper low inside your soul.
So be my gypsy,
Make love your guiding light,
And let that pair of golden earrings
Cast their spell tonight.",Golden Earrings,2001
The Mekons,"lying in bed with my girl from sussex
reading the writings of a man from kent
and the earth in the garden gets blacker
just another war we say
i'm the man from surrey with a ground floor flat
and i know what happened before i was born
the huns and the nips got uppy with blighty
and tommy went out and beat them all home
running for breakfast with my call up forms
seeing the sniper and the bullets in my arms
and the great big bloke from platoon thirty two
is calling me a poof and a stream of number two

The Mekons,"The road up to the past has long been closed
And what is that past to me now
An echo that just could not keep
A bloody slab a bricked up door

The crystal clearness of that summer morning
Two lines of sulfate sparkled on the glass
The same thing happened with that echo
As with what happened in my heart

I'll take a free ride on a wooden horse
That's going round and round and up and down
Don't ask me to give up my polish dreams
I ought to know just who I am

Honey I'm an expert in having fun
But it seems to me like you've just had a wake
I'll sing all night I'm a loaded gun
The rich rise early and the poor sleep late

Right doors won't open but the wrong one's do
Why waste time waiting just walk on through
Take this pill and wash it down
I'll bring out the beast in you

The road up to the past has long been closed
And what is that past to me now
An echo that just could not keep
From bouncing off a bricked up door",Echo,1989

The Mekons,"We never have to stretch our imagination
It is our own lives we can't believe
Years of waiting for the rendezvous
Between the law and reality

Someone talks to themselves by the t.v.
Someone is selling flags and gum
Someone is buying a horoscope
Because the stars are concerned about them

You mustn't do what we did to you
Says the big blonde teacher from oversea
But all his good works and philanthropy
Still can't make the stupid sound clever

Someone is at the top of the building
Someone is having a vision
Someone is biting the hand of the people he chooses to deliver

The Mekons,"I had nothing to do on this hot afternoon
But to settle down and write you a line
I've been meaning to phone you but from Minnesota
Hell it's been a very long time
You wear it well
A little old fashioned but that's all right

Well I suppose you're thinking I bet he's sinking
Or he wouldn't get in touch with me
Oh I ain't begging or losing my head
I sure do want you to know that you wear it well
There ain't a lady in the land so fine

Remember them basement parties, your brother's karate
The all day rock and roll shows
Them homesick blues and radical views
Haven't left a mark on you, you wear it well
A little out of time but I don't mind

But I ain't forgetting that you were once mine
But I blew it without even tryin'
Now I'm eatin' my heart out
Tryin' to get a letter through

Since you've been gone it's hard to carry on
I'm gonna write about the birthday gown that I bought in town
When you sat down and cried on the stairs
You knew it did not cost the earth, but for what it's worth
You made me feel a millionaire and you wear it well
Madame Onassis got nothing on you

Anyway, my coffee's cold and I'm getting told
That I gotta get back to work
So when the sun goes low and you're home all alone
Think of me and try not to laugh and I wear it well
I don't object if you call collect
'Cause I ain't forgetting that you were once mine
But I blew it without even tryin'
Now I'm eatin' my heart out tryin' to get back to you

The Mekons,"Sly like a magpie's shared between the species
Something there glitters, the theft is made
Gold speckled waters, the source unfound
Slips through wet fingers back under ground

The reason for the voyage hasn't been forgot
The trail's not cold, the coals are hot
The crew draw back together like magnets

Salmon at sea that head back to fresh water
To the head of the stream and the inevitable slaughter
Carry the future back off down the river

Affection explained in a watched world
There's nothing of magic in this shining pearl

The water gets red with the rust of an anchor
The blood and the paint from the towns that got captured
Where something dissolved and got free in the current

Locked in black boxes they'll find their way
Thrown out on the highway they get home just the same
Each fishy sparkles again and again

Where rough diamonds lie
A lens that bends all light
Will change and shape to suit its eye
Where rough diamonds lie

Affection explained in a watched world
There's nothing of magic in this shining pearl
Where rough diamonds lie",Diamonds,2007

Give me the half-hearted smile

The Mel Cooleys,"When the world is darker than I can understand.
When nothing turns out the way I planned.
When the sky turns grey and there's no end in sight.
When I can't sleep through the lonely night.

I turn to you. Like a flower leaning toward the sun.
I turn to you. 'Cos you're the only one.
Who can turn me around when I'm upside down.
I turn to you.

When my insides are wracked with anxiety.
You have the touch that will quiet me.
You lift my spirit. You melt the ice.
When I need inspiration, when I need advice.

I turn to you. Like a flower leaning toward the sun.
I turn to you. 'Cos you're the only one.
Who can turn me around when I'm upside down.
I turn to you.

Where would I be? What would I do?
If you'd never helped me through.
I hope someday if you've lost your way.
You could turn to me like I turn to you.

I turn to you. Like a flower leaning toward the sun.
I turn to you. 'Cos you're the only one.
Who can turn me around when I'm upside down.

The Mel-Tones,"Shaking the blues away, unhappy news away
If you are blue, it's easy to
Shake off your cares and troubles

Telling the blues to go, they may refuse to go
But as a rule, they'll go if you'll
Shake them away

Do like the voodoos do, list'ning to a voodoo melody
They shake their bodies so, to and fro
With every shake, a lucky break

If you would lose your weary blues

Sadly I'm reminiscing, madly again I'm kissing

I met her in Monterey, in old Mexico
Stars and steel guitars
And luscious lips as red as wine
Broke somebody's heart
And I'm afraid that it was mine

I left her and threw away the key to paradise

That I left in old Monterey

Making believe I'm merry
In every glass of sherry
I see the sparkle of her eye
And when I hear the cello
Tender and sweet and mellow
I hear the music of her sigh
