Bob Haggart,"Don't even go to a movie show
If you're not by my side,
I stay home by my radio,
But I'm satisfied!
All my flirtin' days are gone,
On the level from now on!

Don't go for any excitement now,
Books are my best company.
All my opinions have changed somehow,
Old-fashioned as can be!
When you really learn to care,
There's a thrill in solitaire!

Keepin' ou of mischief now,
Really am in love, and how!
I'm through playing with fire,
It's you whom I desire!

All the world can plainly see
You're the only one for me!
I've told them in advance
They can't break up our romance!
Living up to every vow,
I'm keepin' out of mischief now!

All the world can plainly see
That you're the only one for me!
Say I've told them, told them in advance
That they can't break up our romance!
Living up to every vow,
I'm keepin', keepin' out of mischief now!",Keeping Out of Mischief Now,2000
Bob Haggart,"There is no greater love
Than what I feel for you
No greater love, no heart so true

There is no greater thrill
Than what you bring to me
No sweeter song
Than what you sing to me

You're the sweetest thing
I have ever known
And to think that
You are mine alone

There is no greater love
In all the world, it's true
No greater love
Than what I feel for you

You're the sweetest thing
I have ever known

Bob Haggart,"Lonely grief is hounding me
Like the lonely shadow hounding me
It's always there just out of sight
Like a fragling dream on a lightening night

Lonely wind cries out my name
Sad as haunted music in the rain
It's born of grief and born of woe
But I hear it call and I've got to go

Where can I be headed for
The blues call in my north
To lick my heart once more
Love lives in a lonely land
Where there's no helping hand to understand

Why does it bring this hate to me
Why it don't matter why
I only know misery has to be part of me

Never hope to count on love
To be a partner of that heaven above
Never hope to understand
Love is a barren land
A lonely land
A lonely land",Deep Song,2002
Bob Haggart,"Listen to my tale of woe
It's terribly sad, but true
All dressed up, no place to go
Each evening I'm awfully blue

I must win some handsome guy
Can't go on like this
I could blossom out I know
With somebody just like you, so

Oh, sweet and lovely lady, be good
Oh, lady, be good to me
I am so awfully misunderstood
So, lady, be good to me

Oh, please, have some pity
I'm all alone in this big city
I tell you I'm just a lonesome babe in the wood
So, lady, be good to me

Bob Haggart,"I'm thru with love,
I'll never fall again.
Said I do to love,
Don't ever call again.
For I must have you
Or no one.
That's why I'm thru with love.

I've locked my heart.
I keep my feelings there.
I have stopped my heart
Like an icy frigidaire.
For I need to care for no one.
That's why I'm thru with love.

Why did you leave me
To think that you cared.
You didn't need me.
You have your share
of slaves around you
To hound you and swear
Their deep devotion.
Emotion.

Did you good by the spring 
And all it meant to me
a good neighbor

For I must have you or no one.

I'm happy to do whatever I do for you

Bob Haggart,"When the moon's kinda dreamy
Starry eyed and dreamy
And nights are luscious and long
If you're kinda lonely
All by you're only
Then nothin' but the blues are brewin'
The blues are brewin'

When the wind through the window
Blows across your pillow
And tells you sleepin' is wrong
If love goes a thirsting
Till you feel like bursting
Then nothing but the blues are brewin'
The blues are brewin'

Suppose you want somebody
But you ain't got nobody
You only get a gleam in your eyes
Till somebody's found you
And put their lovin' arms around you
You got the feelin' you want to die

But when the Lord up above you
Send's someone to love you
The blues are something you loose
You're so busy doing
The things that you're doing
That love ain't got no time
For brewin' the blues

But when the Lord up above you

You haunt me
With dreadful ease
Of days gone by

In my solitude
You taunt me
With memories
That never die

I sit in my chair
And filled with despair
There's no one could be so sad
With gloom everywhere
I sit and I stare
I know that I'll soon go mad

In my solitude
I'm afraid

Send back my love

Bob Haggart,"It seems like only yesterday
I sailed from out of Cork
A wanderer from Erin's isle
I landed in New York
There wasn't a soul to greet me there
A stranger on your shore
But Irish luck was with me here
And riches came galore
And now that I'm going back again
To dear old Erin's isle
My friends will meet me on the pier
And greet me with a smile
Their faces, sure, I've almost forgot
I've been so long away
But me mother will introduce them all
And this to me will say

Shake hands with your Uncle Mike, me boy
And here is your sister, Kate
And there's the girl you used to swing
Down by the garden gate
Shake hands with all of the neighbors
And kiss the colleens all
You're as welcome as the flowers in May
To dear old Donnegal

They'll give a party when I go home
They'll come from near and far
They'll line the roads for miles and miles
With Irish jauntin' cars
The spirits'll flow and we'll be gay
We'll fill your hearts with joy
The piper'll play an Irish reel
To greet the Yankee boy
We'll dance and sing the whole night long
Such fun as never seen
The lads'll be decked in corduroy
The colleens wearin' green
There'll be thousands there that I never saw
I've been so long away
But me mother will introduce them all
And this to me will say

Bob Haggart,"Sure it's the same old shillelagh
Me father brought from Ireland.
And divil a man prouder than He,
As he walked with it in his hand.

He'd lead the band on Paddy's Day
And twirle it round his mitt
And divil a bit we'd laught at it
Or Dad would have a fit

Sure with the same old shillelagh
Me father could lick a dozen men
As fast as they'd get up be gorry,
He'd knock 'em down again

Bob Haggart,"Mrs. Murphy gave a party just about a week ago.
Everything was plentiful, The Murphys, they're not slow.
They treated us like gentlemen, we tried to act the same,
If it weren't for what happened
Well, it was a doggone shame.

When Mrs. Murphy dished the chowder out, she fainted on the spot.
She found a pair of overalls at the bottom of the pot.
McGinty, he got roaring mad, his eyes were bulging out,
He jumped onto the piano and loudly he did shout

""Who threw the overalls in Mrs. Murphy's chowder?""
Nobody spoke, so he shouted all the louder,
""It's a rotten trick that's true, I can lick the drip that threw
The overalls in Mrs. Murphy's chowder.""

They dragged the pants from out the soup and laid them on the floor.
Each man swore upon his life, he'd ne'er seen them before.
They were plastered up with mortar and had patches on the knee,
They'd had their many ups and downs as we could plainly see.

And when Mrs. Murphy, she came to, she b'gan to cry and pout,
She'd put them in the wash that day and forgot to pull them out.
McGinty, he excused himself for what he said that night,
So we put music to the words and sang with all our might

And Henessee Tennessee tootles the flute and the music is something grand

Out in West Virginia
Is a little college
(Rah, Rah, Rah)
All the student body
Only cared for football
Never mind the knowledge
(Rah, Rah, Rah)
Never mind the sheepskin
They preferred the pigskin
Seemed to have it in their bones
Yeah, they knew all about it
Couldn't do without it
All except a certain Mr. Jamboree Jones
And he played the clarinet with all his might
He studied night and day, he practiced day and night
No runnin' up the field for Mr. Jones
He'd rather run up the scale and down the scale,
What tones.

Even though his buddies
Always cut their studies
To attend the rallies
(Rah, Rah, Rah)
While they all were rootin'
You could hear him tootin'
""What's become of Sally""
(Rah, Rah, Rah)

How they used to hate him
Co-eds wouldn't date him
Thought he was an awful bore
Oh, but he liked his rhythm
More than being with 'em
So he'd only turn in
For to practice some more

And meanwhile the team marched on to greater fame
Till they were asked to play that famous Rose Bowl game
And on that day of days the students beamed
What did they do when the team marched on the scene
I want to tell you ladies and you gentlemen, they screamed.

They pulled every trick off
But they couldn't win it

Instead of goin' forwards
They were goin' backwards
'Bout a mile a minute
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Seein' their position
They called intermission
And they heard the referee say
Hey, seventeen to nothin'
Ain't exactly nothin'

And you've only got about a minute to play
And then from the stand there came a distant wail
And it was Jamboree a-swingin' ""Hold 'em Yale""

And then the students all began to yell
The players marched up the field
And down the field, pell mell.

Now on a certain West Virginia hill
There stands that college still
Just as it always will
And there's a picture in the hall of fame
You'll find the boy in the frame who won the game

Bob Haggart & His Orchestra,"Lonely grief is hounding me
Like the lonely shadow hounding me
It's always there just out of sight
Like a fragling dream on a lightening night

Sad as haunted music in the rain
It's born of grief and born of woe
But I hear it call and I've got to go

Where can I be headed for
The blues call in my north
To lick my heart once more
Love lives in a lonely land
Where there's no helping hand to understand

Why does it bring this hate to me
Why it don't matter why
I only know misery has to be part of me

To be a partner of that heaven above
Never hope to understand

I was kissed by my sisters, my cousins, and my aunties.

Where have I been all these years?

How long has this been going on?

There were chills up my spine,
And some thrills I can't define.
Listen, sweet, I repeat:
How long has this been going on?

Finding another world.

Well at least I don't depend upon

You're faithful and you're fair
Put it there (skin me Dad, skin me)

You've got that something in your voice
So right for selling cheese (hustle a lot of the stuff)
Put it there, pal. Put it there (put that back in the bowl)

You know, I think your jokes are great (really?)
It's just that folks are hard to please (they're just snobs, that all)
Put it there, pal. Put it there

Your face could make a fortune
Just your nose should make a lot (how do you siphon?)
I like the way you wear those gaudy-colored shirts you've got, boy!
The only time a rainbow ever covered up a pot
You're such a perfect square (oh-oh, is that on the paper?)
(where?, where?)

Shall we dance?
Sorry, I have my heavy underwear on
Oh, just to once around, to the adrenalin, huh?
Well, OK, if I lead

My colleague, my crony, my cohort, my friend
Companions, confederates, chums to the end
Like meat and potatoes, or salt and tomatoes
Boy, what a blend

Don't put it in the paper (don't worry about me)
Don't put it on the air (I'll finish it)
Don't put it in your pipe
Put it there

Leave your name with the girl when you go out
We may get to you for some crowd noises

That I always have found it best,

Bob Hope,"Ev'ning marks the close of day,
Skies of blue begin to grey,
Crimson hues are fading in the West;
Ev'ning ever brings to me
Dreams of days that used to be,
Memories of those I love the best.
 
When shadows fall 
And trees whisper day is ending,
My thoughts are ever wending Home.
When the crickets call,
My heart is forever yearning,
Once more to be returning Home.
When the hills conceal the setting sun,
Stars begin a peeping one by one.
Night covers all 
And, though fortune may forsake me,
Sweet dreams will ever take me Home.

Bob Hope,"There once was a farmer who took a young miss
In back of the barn where he gave her a 
Lecture on horses and chickens and eggs,
And told her that she has such beautiful
Manners that suited a girl of her charms,
A girl that he'd like for to take in his
Washing and ironing, and then if she did,
They could get married and raise lots of

Sweet violets, sweeter than the roses,
Covered all over from head to toe,
Covered all over with sweet violets.

The girl told the farmer that he'd better stop, 
And she told her father and called a 
Taxi which got there before very long,
For someone was doing his little girl
Right for a change, and so here's what he said:
""If you marry her, son, you're better off
Single 'cause it's always been my belief,
Marriage can bring a man nothing but

[Chorus]

The farmer decided he'd wed anyway,
And started in planning for his wedding
Suit which he'd purchased for only one buck,
But then he found out he was just out of
Money and so he got left in the lurch,
Standing and waiting in front of the
End of this story, which just goes to show,
All a girl wants from a man is his

Has left her old companions and faded from view

Lonely men with lonely eyes are seeking her in vain
Her streets are where they were, but there's no sign of her

She has left the Seine

The last time I saw Paris, her heart was warm and gay,
I heard the laughter of her heart in every street cafe

The last time I saw Paris, her trees were dressed for spring,
And lovers walked beneath those trees and birds found songs to sing.

I dodged the same old taxicabs that I had dodged for years.
The chorus of their squeaky horns was music to my ears.

The last time I saw Paris, her heart was warm and gay,
No matter how they change her, I'll remember her that way.

I'll think of happy hours, and people who shared them
Old women, selling flowers, in markets at dawn

Bob Hope,"Mommy told me something a little girl should know
It's all about the Devil and I've learned to hate him so
She says he causes trouble when you let him in the room
He will never ever leave you if your heart is filled with gloom

So, let the sun shine in, face it with a grin
Smilers never lose and frowners never win
So, let the sun shine in, face it with a grin
Open up your heart and let the sun shine in

When you are unhappy, the Devil wears a grin
But oh, he starts a-running when the light comes pouring in
I know he'll be unhappy 'cause I'll never wear a frown
Maybe if we keep on smiling he'll get tired of hangin' around

So, let the sun shine in, face it with a grin
Smilers never lose and frowners never win
So, let the sun shine in, face it with a grin
Open up your heart and let the sun shine in

If I forget to say my prayers the Devil jumps with glee
But he feels so awful, awful, when he sees me on my knees
So if you're full of trouble and you never seem to win
Just open up your heart and let the sun shine in

So, let the sun shine in, face it with a grin
Smilers never lose and frowners never win
So, let the sun shine in, face it with a grin
Open up your heart and let the sun shine in",Open Up Your Heart,2010
Bob Hope,"Time and again I've longed for adventure
Something to make my heart beat much faster
What did I long for, I never really knew.
Finding your love, I found my adventure,
Touching your hand my heart beat much faster
All that I want in all of this world is you.

You are the promised kiss of springtime
That makes the lonely winter seem long
You are the breathless hush of evening
That trembles on the brink of a lovely song.
You are the angel glow that lights the star,
The dearest things I know are what you are.
Someday my happy arms will hold you,
And someday I'll know that moment divine
When all the things you are, are mine.",All the Things You Are,2010
Bob Hope,"Little Lilly was oh! So silly and shy
And all the fellows knew,
She wouldn't bill and coo:
Ev'ry single night some smart fellow would try 
o cuddle up to her, but she would cry:
 
""Ma, he's making eyes at me!
Ma he's awful nice to me!
Ma he's almost breaking my heart,
I'm beside him, Mercy!
Let his conscience guide him!
Ma, he wants to marry me,
Be my honey bee.
Ev'ry minute he gets bolder,
Now he's leaning on my shoulder,
Ma, he's kissing me!""
 
Lilly was so good, ev'ry body could tell.
You'd never see her roam,
She'd always stay at home;
All the neighbors knew little Lilly too well.
For when the boys would call, They'd hear her yell:
 
Ma, he's making eyes at me!
Ma he's awful nice to me!
Ma he's almost breaking my heart,
If you peek in, Can't you see I'm goin' to weaken?
Ma, he wants to marry me,
Be my honey bee.
Ma, I'm meeting with resistance, 
I shall holler for assistance,
Ma, he's kissing me!""

Moonlight and stars can make such a fool of me.
You know you're much too near, and I am too romantic,
Wouldn't I be a sight on a bended knee.

I'm startled when you whisper, I'll run if you should sigh,
I must be so careful, or I'll kiss my heart goodbye.
You shouldn't let me dream 'cause I'm too romantic,
Don't make me fall unless it could all come true.",Too Romantic,2010

Bob Hope & Shirley Ross,"Thanks for the memory
Of sentimental verse,
Nothing in my purse,
And chuckles
When the preacher said
For better or for worse,
How lovely it was.

Thanks for the memory
Of Schubert's Serenade,
Little things of jade
And traffic jams
And anagrams
And bills we never paid,
How lovely it was.

We who could laugh over big things
Were parted by only a slight thing.
I wonder if we did the right thing,
Oh, well, that's life, I guess,
I love your dress.

Thanks for the memory
Of faults that you forgave,
Of rainbows on a wave,
And stockings in the basin
When a fellow needs a shave,
Thank you so much.

Thanks for the memory
Of tinkling temple bells,
Alma mater yells
And Cuban rum
And towels from
The very best hotels,
Oh how lovely it was.

Thanks for the memory
Of cushions on the floor,
Hash with Dinty Moore,
That pair of gay pajamas
That you bought
And never wore.

That I always have found it best,
Instead of getting 'em off my chest,

May come around to see my point of view
What price the Crown of a King on his throne

Bob Howes,"The clock struck midnight
And through my sleeping
I heard a tapping at my door
I looked but nothing lay in the darkness
And so I turned inside once more
To my amazement
There stood a raven
Whose shadow hung above my door
Then through the darkness
It spoke that one word
That I shall hear forever more
Nevermore
Thus quoth the raven, nevermore
And still the raven remains in my room
No matter how much I implore
No words can soothe him
No prayer remove him
And I must hear for evermore
Quoth the raven, nevermore

No one will see me
No one with guilt to share, no secret soul to trust

Louder and louder
Till I could tell the sound was not within my ears
You should have seen me
You would have seen my eyes grow white and cold with fear

Heard all the things in Heaven and Earth
I've seen many things in Hell

Is the eye of the Devil himself

A ploughin' through the ragged skies
And up a cloudy draw.
Yippee-yi-ay, yippee-yi-o,

Their brands were still on fire and their hooves was made of steel,
Their horns wuz black and shiny and their hot breath he could feel,
A bolt of fear went through him as they thundered through the sky,
For he saw the riders comin' hard
And he heard their mournful cry.

With sweat,

On horses snortin' fire
As they ride on, hear their cry.

Bob James,"Everyone knows him as Old Folks
Like the seasons, he'll come and he'll go
Just as free as a bird and as good as his word
That's why everybody loves him so

Always leaving his spoon in his coffee
Tucks his napkin up under his chin
And that yellow cow-pie is so mellow it's ripe
But you needn't be ashamed of him
Every Friday he'll go fishing, down on his favorite lake
But he only hooks a perch or two, the whale got away
Looks like we warm the steak

Ages ago last night?

To think that spring had depended
On merely this: a look, a kiss
To think that something so splendid
Could slip away in one little daybreak

The arms that clung

And blame all your charms that melt in my arms

Ever since the hour of our meeting
I've been repeating a silly phrase
Hoping that you'll understand me one of these days.

In the album of my memory
Serenade in blue

It seems like only yesterday
The small cafe, a crowded floor
And as we danced the night away
I hear you say forever more
And then the song became a sigh
Forever more became goodbye

Should I go on whistling in the dark,

And now when I hear people curse the chance that was wasted
I know but too well what they mean

Let the love that was once a fire remain an ember
Let it sleep like the dead desire I only remember

And I spied a young chick
She was going my way
I moved over beside her
And I stayed for awhile
She looked up at me and she gave me a smile
I said Beaba, Beaba, I ain’t going to let you go
I said Beaba, Beaba, I ain’t going to let you go
I need you Beaba, can’t do without you no more

She was right in my face
With a great big smack
She looked real cool and said
What’s happening Jack?
I was boxed real good
High on a hill
So I says to her
Nothing’s happening Jill
I said Beaba, Beaba, I ain’t going to let you go
I said Beaba, Beaba, I ain’t going to let you go
I need you Beaba, can’t do without you no more

She turned her head and looked
Her eyes won’t lie
Said to me, “Boy, don’t hand me that jive!”
I looked her up and down
From her head to her tip
Said to her, “Beaba, I knows your hip!”
I said Beaba, Beaba, I ain’t going to let you go
I said Beaba, Beaba, I ain’t going to let you go
I need you Beaba, can’t do without you no more

She was geared real crazy
And I knew she could
The thing I didn’t know was she really would
She bugged that man until he was nearly dead
Then she came home and shot me in the head
I said Beaba, Beaba, I ain’t going to let you go

Now that we’re civilized in 2008,

I felt in the mood for some dancin’ soon
All I need to make my plan complete
Was a slick chick that was super sweet

She said boo
Expected something mellow
Something like a chance
I thought that maybe this was, ‘cause this ain’t bad
But she quickly taught me a thing or two
All I got from her was a big fat boo

Cruised up and down for an hour or two
My red car sweeping the avenue
All at once a target came into sight
So I zeroed in with a wolfish delight

She said boo

I sat upon your knee
I wrote to you
With childhood fantasies

Well, I'm all grown up now
Can you still help somehow?
I'm not a child
But my heart still can dream

So here's my lifelong wish
My grown-up Christmas list
Not for myself
But for our world in need

No more lives torn apart
That wars would never start
And time would heal all hearts

Every man would have a friend
And right would always win
And love would never end
This is my grown-up Christmas list

What is this illusion called?
The innocence of youth
Maybe only in our blind belief
Can we ever find the truth

There'd be no more lives torn apart
And wars would never start
And time would heal all hearts

Every man would have a friend
And right would always win
And love would never end

This is my grown-up Christmas wish
This is my only lifelong wish
This is my grown-up Christmas list

Bob Kulick,"And here, my prize, the Black Widow. 
Isn't she lovely? And so deadly. 
Her kiss is fifteen times more poisonous than the rattlesnake. 
And you see her venom is highly neurotoxic 
Which is to say that it attacks the central nervous system 
Causing intense pain
Profuse sweating
Difficulty in breathing
Loss of consciousness
Violent convulsions 
And finally death. 
You know what I think I love the most about her 
Is her inborn need to dominate and possess. 
Such power and dignity, unhampered by sentiment. 
If I may put forward a slice of personal philosophy
I feel that man has ruled this world as a stumbling dimented child-king long enough!
And as his empire crumbles, my precious Black Widow shall rise as his most fitting successor! 

These words he speaks are true
We're all humanary stew
If we don't pledge allegiance to
The Black Widow

The horror that he'll brings
The horror of his sting
The unholiest of kings
The Black Widow

Our minds will be destroyed
And every girl and boy
Will learn to be employed
The Black Widow

Love me
Yes we love me
Love him
Yes we love him
Love me
Yes we love him, oh

He sits upon his throne
And picks at all the bones
Of his husbands and his wives
He's devoured
He stares with a gleam
With a laugh so obscene
and the children and the virgins
He's deflowered

Love me
Yes we love me
Love him
Yes we love him
Love me
Yes we love him, oh

Our thoughts are hot and crazed
Our dreams are webbed in haze
Mindless, senseless daze

Laid off and I'm having double trouble.

Bad luck and trouble has taken me
I have no money to show.

Someone is speaking, but she doesn't know he's there

[Chorus: x2]
I want her everywhere
And if she's beside me I know I need never care
But to love her is to need her everywhere
Knowing that love is to share
Each one believing that love never dies
Watching her eyes and hoping I'm always there

I will be there
And everywhere

Bob Magnuson,"If you hear
A song in blue
Like a flower crying
For the dew
That was my heart serenading you
My prelude to a kiss

If you hear a song that grows
From my tender sentimental woes
That was my heart trying to compose
A prelude to a kiss

Though it's just a simple melody
With nothing fancy
Nothing much
You could turn it to a symphony
A Shubert tune with a Gershwin touch

Oh how my love song gently cries
For the tenderness within your eyes
My love is a prelude that never dies

Bob Magnusson,"Laura is the face in the misty lights.
Footsteps that you hear down the hall.
The love that floats on a summer night,
That you can never quite recall.

And you see Laura on a train that is passing through.
Those eyes how familiar they seem
She gave your very first kiss to you,
That was Laura but she's only a dream.",Laura,
Bob Magnusson,"The night is like a lovely tune
Beware my foolish heart
How white the ever constant moon
Take care my foolish heart

There's a line between love and fascination
That's hard to see, how many names such as this
For they both have the very same sensation
When you're locked in the magic of a kiss

Her lips are much too close to mine
Beware my foolish heart
But should our eager lips combine
Then let the fire start

For this time it isn't fascination
Or a dream that will fade and fall apart
It's love, this time it's love
My foolish heart",My Foolish Heart,

Two lovers alone and out of sight
Seeing images in the firelight
As my eyes visualize a family
They see Emily, Emily

Bob Mann,"I have wrestled in the darkness 
of this lonely pilgrim land
Raising strong and mighty fortresses 
that I alone command
But these castles 
I've constructed by the 
strength of my own hand
Are just temporary kingdoms 
on foundations made of sand

In the middle of the battle 
I believe I've finally found
I'll never know the thrill of victory 
'til I'm willing to lay down
All my weapons of defense and 
earthly strategies of war
So I'm laying down my arms and 
running helplessly to Yours

I surrender all my silent hopes and dreams
Though the price to follow costs me everything
I surrender all my human soul desires
If sacrifice requires
That all my kingdoms fall
I surrender all

If the source of my ambition 
is the treasure I obtain
If I measure my successes on 
a scale of earthly gain
If the focus of my vision 
is the status I attain
My accomplishments are 
worthless and my efforts are in vain

So I lay aside these trophies 
to pursue a higher crown
And should You choose somehow 
to use the life I willingly lay down
I surrender all the triumph for 
it's only by Your grace
I relinquish all the glory, 
I surrender all the praise

Everything I am, all I've done, 
and all I've known 
Now belongs to You, 
the life I live is not my own
Just as Abraham laid Isaac 
on the sacraficial fire
If all I have is all that You desire

And I've burned a lot of bridges

My place is with you

I've had my promises forsaken
Into many empty words
And I'm amazed and so astounded
That I won't get what I deserve
Whatever lies I've lived for
I have finally found the truth
I know my place, my place is with you

You are my treasure forever

Out of town were the people I knew
I had that feeling of self-pity
What to do, what to do, what to do

But as I walked through the foggy streets alone
It turned out to be the luckiest day I've known

A foggy day, in London town
Had me low, had me down
I viewed the morning, with much alarm
British Museum, had lost its charm

Could this thing last
But the age of miracles, hadn't past

Oh! Will you never set me free?
The ties that bound us
Are still around us

And still those little things remain
That bring me happiness or pain

A cigarette that bears a lipstick's traces
An airline ticket to romantic places
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
A tinkling piano in the next apartment
Those stumbling words that told you what my heart meant
A fair ground's painted swings
These foolish things remind me of you
You came you saw you conquer'd me
When you did that to me
I knew somehow this had to be
The winds of March that make my heart a dancer
A telephone that rings but who's to answer?

And candle lights on little corner tables

How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The sigh of midnight trains in empty stations
Silk stockings thrown aside dance invitations

Gardenia perfume ling'ring on a pillow
Wild strawb'ries only seven francs a kilo

The waiters whistling as the last bar closes
The song that Crosby sings

How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me

And she ain't lookin' for a man

To her nothing sounds so good as a ringing slide guitar
She loves it slow and deep, and she feels it in her heart
She says ""hush, I'm trying to listen""
When men hit on her at the bar

But with all he possesses self preservation comes first
His damnation comes not from burning free
As destruction of the poor is their poverty, is their poverty

Ah, but in this he does rejoice
His burdens though heavy, he somehow bears
As for his seed, there's only one who cares
There's only one who cares

Though his pilgrimage extends, his progresses ascend
But as the prudent one exalts, he is gonna find his faults

There you are, you're takin' true love
And while you're takin' true love, you givin' the blame

You see, I was born and raised in the slums of the city,
It was a one room shack that slept ten other children besides me.
We hardly had enough food or room to sleep.
It was hard times,
Needed something to ease my troubled mind.
Listen!  my father didn't know the meaning of work,
He disrespected mama, and treated us like dirt.
I left home, seekin' a job that I never did find,
Depressed and downhearted I took to cloud nine,
I'm doin' fine, up here on cloud nine.
Listen one more time I'm doin' fine, up here on cloud nine.
Folks down there tell me,
They say, ""give yourself a chance son, don't let life pass you by"".
But the world of reality is a rat race where only the strongest survive,
It's a dog eat dog world, and that ain't no lie.
Listen!  it ain't even safe no more to walk the streets at night,
I'm doin' fine, on cloud nine.
Let me tell you about cloud nine.

Cloud nine, you can be what you wanna be
(cloud nine) you ain't got no responsibility,
And ev'ry man, ev'ry man is free
(cloud nine)  and you're a million miles from reality.
I wanna say I love the life I live,
And I'm gonna live the life I love up here on cloud nine.

And I'm haunted by your love day by day

Only every time you're awake
I know how much I miss you, love you too
Oh girl, you're the most, from pillar to post
With my feet on the ground and my head in the sky
I'm on solid ground and I know we'll be riding high
And I'm haunted by your love day by day

Haunted by the visions that I see
Haunted, of the the mission to be free
With my feet on the ground and my head in the sky
I'm on solid ground and I know we'll be riding high
And I'm haunted, wanted for your love
Haunted by your love, haunted, wanted by your love

Oh honey, our love is fascinating
Ooh child, it's so amazing, yeah, in my dreams
Oh, your lies won't let me sleep
Haunted by your love

Haunted by your love, haunted by your love
Wanted for your love, haunted by your love
Haunted by your love, haunted by your love
Wanted for your love, haunted by your love

Wanted for your love, haunted by your love
Wanted for your love, haunted by your love",Haunted,2004
