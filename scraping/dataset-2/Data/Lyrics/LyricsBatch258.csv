What up?
Tell Jigga we need 4 apples,
2 bananas and 5 oranges
You sure?
Nigga, he know what I'm talkin 'bout
Aight, I'll get him on the phone
From my block to yo block nigga
The world belongs to who?

The world belongs to us
You can do what you want to do
What you gon do? Huh? What?
The streets belong to us
You can do what you want to do
What you gon do? Huh? What?

Yo from the South to the East nigga, from the streets to the burbs
I fuck wit niggas when they talk, the speech just be slurred
You know me Mr. Got dough, Mr. Got flow
Couldn't figure our out which one wanted both of 'em so
Mr. Got both - if you hate me stop, if you jealous
Silkk the Shock, Jigga, No Limit, Master P, Roc-A-Fella
Used to cop bricks for 30
Now I do nothin but sit back and drop hits, ya heard me?
I ain't nothin but a thug that got rich ya heard me
Drop the top when it's hot
If not call Jay tell him blow the mall up and
Come and shop in Jersey
You know what I did, you know how I come
You wouldn't even think about testin me dog if you know what I done
Didn't change a bit, I'm still thuggish, still thuggin
Niggaz ask how much money I got do math
You know how to add I'm P little brother
Shit, I can't tell y'all nothin I gotta show y'all
Real in this, I'm as real as it gets I told y'all
Yo I sleep through the rain, sleep through the pain
Would have knew about me but you don't
Cause know why, cuase you was sleep when I came
But I'm here now, y'all suckas fear now
Look, plan on bein on top, don't stop, plan on bein hot year round
I don't do it for no love, I do it for the thugs
Do it for my block, do it for the VIP spots in the club
It's hard to stop this life like it's hard to call cocked dice
We ain't nothin but some bout it, bout it niggaz
That live the ""Hard Knock Life""

[Chorus]
From my block to yo block, it's a sho' shot
We out the door, out the most, and the flow don't stop
You know what we do, you know what we 'bout
You know what we do, you know what we 'bout

From my block to yo block, it's a sho' shot
We out the door, out the most, and the flow don't stop
From the ghetto to the suburbs, from Marcy to the 3rd
You know what we do when we come through, ya heard?

In the south nigga
Deep in the four door, watchin that old dog
Or in the club nigga, shakin' them hoes off
Poppin my foes off ain't nothin changed
Or catch me on the block with thugs knockin the o's off
Baggin that 'dro nigga, stackin that dough
Clappin at foes and I'm laughin at hoes
Holdin them dice and I'm breakin yo bank
You see the shit Roc-A-Fella make wit The Tank
Even without the airplay platinum off of heresay
It's your year Jay get off my dick
Been my year, you talkin to a winner here
Iceberg winter's wear, linen chair
My style intact, money ain't come from rap
And we can take it right back if it comes to that
Block or Billboard, you gotta feel dog
I stay real y'all, that's how I kill y'all

[Chorus]

I used to rap, now B-ball's my life
Move that house on the lake for the kids and the wife
Check the bank account, it's seven figures
Who that Rolls in the video for, it's mines nigga
I got game, ask the players in the pro's
Who got shot, it ain't my fault 
(Ohhhh it ain't my fault) he owed me dough
Independent, black-owned, my world, my country
No Limit and Roc-A-Fella run this like drug money
So can I get a huh, huh? A what, what?
Pass the weed cause soldiers like to puff, puff
From the South to the East baby, baby
A couple of unggggh's now they gotta pay me
And flip bricks with ghetto chicks with no bicks
And nine's with no clips and sides wit no chips
Come fast or slow, from cheddar to dough
Master P, Silkk the Shocker, Jay-Z
The rowdiest niggaz you know

[Chorus]

Get ya money dog
Get ya money y'all
Get ya money dog
Get ya money y'all
Get ya money dog
Get ya money y'all
Get ya, get ya money dog
Get ya, get ya

To the East, to the West whatever
Y'all get y'all money y'all

[Fiend] 
I have a testimony 
Skull I have a testimony 

[Skull Duggery] 
I must watch every rectangle triangle my front sides and back 
Niggas try to take me on a ride and leave me stranded black 
Leave me in spots where I can't fly jack 
Ain't that some shit how niggas come and fuck the game up quick 
I was there when G got popped uh dead in the neck 
Around the corner when Melvin got teked up in the chest 
I was up the block when my compadre Coolie Black got shot 
All up on Second and Clara Blocks now check it 
New change was burnin inside motherfuckers like hell 
The only precautionary measure was to take care of self 
And that's the only way you can survive in the game 
And enhance in the game but lord I really must say 
Everything has got a message and a meaning to it 
A purpose, if you don't believe then your day is coming 
Now I'm a tell you Lord, you've gotta overstand me 
Only thing I'm screamin see, uh 
I got a testimony 

[Fiend] 
I got a testimony 
I have a testimony 

[Fiend] 
My testimony starts losin a homie behind somethin phony 
Flippin those zonie's for Rice A Roni 
Lifted by my lonely for only brother to take, well look at his kid 
You can have my life instead of his, I'm serious 
The fear in me is I never felt this much pain in my body 
But you know what, I never drank that much bracardi, lovin his shorty 
Like she was mine and times I showed that baby the path 
And teach it, ain't no such thing just aim it when you blast 
Please be crazy bout your cash and learn to stash that last dollar 
We be like you kenfolk when your broke, a No Limit rider 
So god, when you hear me hollar please grant my request 
Cause killers behind anybody with a tank on their chest

[Skull Duggery] 
In 1970 a hoodlum was born on this earth 
Didn't ask to come here but when I landed it sure did hurt 
It was a trip to see my life split in half 
>From the drug game on the street to the love I showed my mom and dad 
The pain run deep, ha, nigga can't you tell 
Look at the expression on my face, nigga it hurts like hell 
I have a testimony to tell, this life I will never forget 
Let me hit this life boy, rearrange my whole shit 
Look, I was riding up Third Street as usual 
I was gonna bust a left buck I'm on a cell but I left shampoo hotel 
Man it hurts me, scene it horrified me 
I seen a group of little kids having fun ya dig 
nobody botherin them see 
Until this chump drove up with his big shot gun 
And he shot a round of kids, I say boy 
what this nigga did (what this nigga did) 
And the little kid that he shot boy on the block, end his life 
And the kid's name was James ??? right, and that's my testimony 

[Mr. Serv-On] 
Now see in my life, it ain't never been what it's supposed to be 
Sometimes my tank dogs feel like they losing me 
Sometimes I just feel they don't understand me 
Cause in my life you never tell me life will bring so much harm 
I never thought to see my homie ??? die with needles in his arm 
And like my homie Derrell Fuller, he never got to see his twins born 
And by the way they couldn't see it because they bullets they took 
they couldn't take it 
And you couldn't tell me that these days in my life 
That I believe in the things that I saw 
Shit, I never knew I had this testimony

Decirte que te adoro con todo el corazón

Que es mucho lo que sufro, que es mucho lo que lloro
Que ya no puede mi alma al grito que te imploro
Te imploro y te abro el nombre de mi única ilusión

También quiero que sepas que ya hace muchos días
Que estoy enfermo y pálido de tanto no dormir

Paso mis noches negras tan negras y sombrías
Que ya se han muerto todas las esperanzas mías
Que ya no se ni donde quedo mi porvenir

De noche cuando pongo mi sienes en la almohada 
Hacia otro mundo quiere mi espíritu volver

Camino mucho y mucho al fin de la jornada
La sombra de mi madre se pierde en la nada
Y tú de nuevo vuelves en mi alma aparecer

Que hermoso hubiera sido vivir bajo a aquel techo
Los dos unidos siempre amándonos los dos

Tú siempre enamorada yo siempre satisfecho
Los dos una sola alma los dos un solo pecho
En medio de nosotros mi madre como dios

Se que te estas casando mi bien no lo sabia
Que quieres tú que yo haga rosario de mi vida
Que quieres tu que yo haga con este corazón

And obsessive thinking, of proving our individuality
Yeah, so what can you do when your fellow man, criminalizes your plan
For getting by, and the presence of your body means you've acted
Irresponsibly, and you've failed to be born before all the world was taken

The way to make it I've always found is to;
Turn the thoughts inside
Steal the strength that hides.

To the great escape

All alone in a change, may be a lonely place.
Everything is so strange, in this race...

Time will tell, stand and begin to fight for yourself
Time will tell, anyway
Time will tell, only the strong can take it so well
Time will tell, anyway - Only time will tell.

Take a flame to ignite a try.
Indecision won't satisfy, all the the;
Choices must be made.
When your hand is laid.

In the end there may be some pain.
Before you're back on your feet again, but it;
Always comes out right

He had me meet him at a quarter to two

He said he heard what I was up to
He said he heard I was his style
He said he's been wantin' to meet me
He said he's been coming around for a while

He told me everyone has been talkin' about all the crazy things I do
He told me everyone has been wantin' to come
And have a wild time with you

He said I got a proposition that you might be interested in

And you're gonna take a shot or two

Just let me come and walk with you
If you sell your soul for rock n' roll, I'm gonna give it all to you
I'm gonna make your dreams come true

And it wasn't much of a decision
Here's what was goin' on in my head

I'd go to heaven for the weather, I'd go to hell for the company
And I know it'll be hot down there, but just think of all the friends I'll see
We'll sit around the fuckin' table, talkin' shit and feelin' fine

We'll take shot 'til we're unable to lift our glass another time
Right before I go to bed, I'll grab some girls to clear my head
And think about what the devil fuckin' said

And you're gonna take a shot or two
But it'll be alright, you're gonna be just fine

If you sell your soul for rock n' roll I'm gonna give it all to you

Fighting Instinct,"Sitting on a fence your heart can feel the warmth of the one who pulled you out of the cold
Trying to walk the line, you don't know which way to go but your about to loose your hold
Which way to fall to the wrong or to the right
Jump to one side or fall in to the night.

It's all or nothing
But there's always something

Walking down life's road things try to hinder you at every turn
What don't kill you makes you stronger but how far will you go just to learn
Your closer to the edge now but this is the very snare
You've got to push through now remembering he's still there

It's all or nothing
But there's always something
It's all or nothing

Fighting Instinct,"A dark shadow is arising on a dry and thirsty soul
And in the darkness it is hiding so no one could ever know
Of the emptiness inside him or the rate at which it grows

He tries so hard not to let it show
And God hears his people calling, praying on their knees
And in the midst of all this darkness he here's his Father's plea

It's the call of the great I Am
And like a bright and shining light
In the darkness He is there to guide you
Oh yes He is

Through the worst of my times
The Lord is there to guide me through the trials of my life
And everything that comes my way
Through all the bad and all the good I will find the light of day
And when I've done all I can do and I feel I can't go on
I hear the voice of my God above and His love makes me strong

It's the call of the great I Am
And like a bright and shining light
In the darkness He is there to guide you

A rush that she gives me
Is it just how she sees me
That gives me such a crush

That gives me such a feeling that she gives me

A feeling like its okay
When your arms are around me
Just a glance from her makes me see that I've been taken by this

I wander what my future holds for me in You
I pray all day and night
That I would do just what You want me to
I will live my life for You

Just to please You, Father
Is my one desire
It burns in me
Like a blazing fire

Things may come my way
That will try to make me loose my sight of You
But I will stand strong
To what I know is good and true
I will live my life for You
For the rest of my days

Just to please You, Father
Is my one desire
It burns in me
Like a blazing fire
To preach the gospel to the nation
To every tongue and every race
And Lord, just to please You.




",Just to Please You,2006
Fighting Instinct,"I'll tell You everything I am
I'm lost and lonely
I'm afraid of not knowing when I've lost my way
And now I'm standing still
And I can feel you getting closer
I can feel Your love upon me
Will You light my way

(Chorus)
Will You light my way
So I can see the path beyond the light of day
Will I ever be the same
Will You light my way

A fear of losing what I've gained
Will You help me let it go, let it go
Giving everything I have
I part with nothing that is mine
Does this cost outweigh the cure
Is it more than worth the prize

(Chorus)

I surrender all and I seek Your face

will You light the world
You can light the word
As long as You're in it
As You're in it

And I need You in my heart
I feel You, oh my Lord
And I need You more than ever before

Time and time again You save me
Same as this, that I fall
I might as well be rendered helpless
Cause without You, I'm not at all

I see You, oh my God
And I need You in my heart
I feel You, oh my Lord

",You Don't Know,2006
Fighting Instinct,"I thought I was ahead of the game
Even though I could not name what I was looking for
I thought I had it all worked out
Even though I was feeling the worry and the doubt
I tried to hide behind myself
But You saw right through myself

(Chorus)
You found me first
When I was at my worst
And now I know the love of Jesus Christ
Cause I have You in my life

When I did not know what love was for
It was the very key that opened my heart's door
I thought this peace was just a dream
Like there wasn't anything like this for me
I searched this world and all I found was lies
And then You opened up my eyes

(Chorus)

All these years I could not find the truth
All these times I could not see
All these years I could not find You
And all this time You were watching over me

",You Found Me First,2006
Fighting Instinct,"I thought my world was complete
I was living a life made on shaky ground
I was blinded, so I couldn't see
I couldn't stand, I thought I was drowning

I thought I was sinking
I thought I was dying

I found forever in your arms
I don't decide where I need to be
And I found forever in your arms
I don't decide where I feel free

Some nights I would lie all alone
Dreaming of you and the way things had been
You know I had no chance on my own
Now I can make it with you next to me

Now we are together
Now I found forever

I found forever in your arms
I don't decide where I need to be
And I found forever in your arms
I don't decide where I feel free

Somehow you came
And took all my pain away
I know that I can't
Repay all the love you gave
All the love that you gave

I found forever in your arms
I don't decide where I need to be
And I found forever in your arms
I don't decide where I feel free

I found, I found forever
I found forever in your arms
I found, I found forever
I don't decide where I feel free
Where I feel free

I've tried so hard I don't know what I should do

To bring me back to where I once fell

I just want to find my way back to you
Where love is strong and feels brand new
I just want to find my way back to you
Where love is strong and feels brand new

I'm so tired that I can't fight anymore
It seems as though I've turned and shut my own door
I've prayed so hard hoping that you care
But then I turn and find you are there

(Chorus)

Yes I've been to this place before
Out on this ledge so afraid to look down
Broken down and torn
I find my way to you

You know we don't have all the entire world

Let not the sun their lives

You told me to wake you up
When the hand reaches the six

World if we could see the truth through the lies
But you and I will never be the same
Again

On and Off
The ropes in which I upheld
Two lines across your face
For every smile you gave
To me with love

Help me to hold on to all your foes,
They will be the last ones always

You and I are lost can't save this,
World if we could see the truth through the lies
But you and I will never be the same

And clear the sin of you away

All right, go and get your storybook
No, no, not one of those, a real story
A real story?
Yes! Tell me about when you were a boy
Well, then, I shall have to take you back with me
A long way in time

It was my thirteenth year on a cold winter's day
As I walked through the enchanted forest
I heard the sounds of horses and men at arms
I felt compelled to walk on and find the place of these sounds
And when the forest did clear I was standing on a hill
Before me there was a great plane
Atoned the armies of the world,standing, waiting
I thought to myself, for whom or for what are they waiting?

Suddenly a gust of wind come up from the north
There appeared a lone rider, holding a sword of steel
Then from the south came another, bearing a battle axe
From the east came a third, holding a spiked club
And finally, from the west a rider
Who wielded a great hammer of war, with them came their
Soldiers of death, followed by an army of immortals
They were few in number

But the look in their eyes told all who beheld them
That they would leave this day only in victory or death
And there was a great silence
My heart began to pound, storm clouds filled the sky with darkness
Rain came and four winds blew with such anger
That I held fast to a tree
I watched the four riders raise their weapons into the air
Without warning, screaming their war cry they led the attack

Down to the battle they rode
They met the armies of the world with a mighty clash
I could feel the groundshake, the earth drank much blood that day
Each of the four, was into himself a whirlwind of doom
When the smoke did clear, many thousands were dead
There was much blood and gore
Their bodies lay broken and scattered across the battle field
Like brown leaves blown by the wind

And I saw the four ride together to the top of the hill
While below them the soldiers of death assembled
All those who would now swear allegiance to them
And the four spoke the words of the warriors prayer
Gods of war I call you, my sword is by my side
I seek a life of honor free from all false pride
I will crack the whip with a bold mighty hail
Cover me with death if I should ever fail
Glory, majesty, unity, hail, hail,hail

And as I stood and looked on, I heard the armies of the world
Hail them without end, and their voices of victory
Carried long and far throughout the land

Well, That's it, did you like the story?
Yeah, it was great!
Oh, good, I'm glad, now off to bed with you
Grandfather?
Yes?
Who were those four men?
Who were they? They were the Metal Kings

Filipa Jeronimo,"Hello darkness, my old friend,
I've come to talk with you again,
Because a vision softly creeping,
Left its seeds while I was sleeping,
And the vision that was planted in my brain
Still remains
Within the sound of silence.
In restless dreams I walked alone
Narrow streets of cobblestone,
'Neath the halo of a street lamp,
I turned my collar to the cold and damp
When my eyes were stabbed by the flash of a neon light
That split the night
And touched the sound of silence.

And in the naked light I saw
Ten thousand people, maybe more.
People talking without speaking,
People hearing without listening,
People writing songs that voices never share
And no one dare
Disturb the sound of silence.

""Fools"" said I, ""You do not know
Silence like a cancer grows.
Hear my words that I might teach you,
Take my arms that I might reach you.""
But my words like silent raindrops fell,
And echoed
In the wells of silence

And the people bowed and prayed
To the neon god they made.
And the sign flashed out its warning,
In the words that it was forming.
And the sign said, ""The words of the prophets

Are written on the subway walls
And tenement halls.""
And whisper'd in the sounds of silence.",The Sound of Silence,1999
Filipe Catto,"Tu estás livre e eu estou livre
E há uma noite pra passar
Porque não vamos unidos
Porque não vamos ficar
Na aventura dos sentidos

Tu estás só e eu mais só estou
Tu que tens o meu olhar
Tens a minha mão aberta
À espera de se fechar
Nessa tua mão deserta

Vem que o amor não é o tempo
Nem é o tempo que o faz
Vem que o amor é o momento
Em que eu me dou, em que te dás

Tu que buscas companhia
E eu que busco quem quiser
Ser o fim desta energia
Ser um corpo de prazer
Ser o fim de mais um dia

Tu continuas à espera
Do melhor que já não vem
E a esperança foi encontrada
Antes de ti por alguém
E eu sou melhor que nada

Vem que o amor não é o tempo
Nem é o tempo que o faz
Vem que o amor é o momento
Em que eu me dou, em que te dás
Amor não é o tempo
Nem é o tempo que o faz
Vem que o amor é o momento

Filipe Melo,"Isn't she lovely 
Isn't she wonderful 
Isn't she precious 
Less than one minute old 
I never thought through love we'd be 
Making one as lovely as she 
But isn't she lovely made from love 
Isn't she pretty 
Truly the angel's best 
Boy, I'm so happy 
We have been heaven blessed 
I can't believe what God has done 
Through us he's given life to one 
But isn't she lovely made from love 
Isn't she lovely 
Life and love are the same 
Life is Aisha

Without you who conceived the one

Filipe Pinto,"Parava no café quando ela estava
Na voz tinha o talento dos pedintes
Entre um cigarro e outro lá cravava a bica
Ao melhor dos seus ouvintes

As mãos e o olhar da mesma cor
Cinzenta como a roupa que trazia
Num gesto que podia ser de amor
Sorria, e ao partir agradecia

São os loucos de Lisboa
Que nos fazem duvidar
A Terra gira ao contrário
E os rios nascem no mar

Um dia numa sala do quarteto
Passou um filme lá do hospital
Onde o esquecido filmado no gueto
Entrava como artista principal

Compramos a entrada p'ra sessão
Pra ver tal personagem no écran
O rosto maltratado era a razão
D'eu não aparecer pela manhã

São os loucos de Lisboa
Que nos fazem duvidar
A Terra gira ao contrário
E os rios nascem no mar

Mudamos muita vez de calendário
Como o café mudou de freguesia
Deixamos de tributo a quem lá pára
Um louco a fazer-lhe companhia

É sempre a mesma posse o mesmo olhar
De quem não mede os dias que vagueam
Sentado la continua a cravar
Beijinhos as meninas que passeiam

São os loucos de Lisboa

Far away, alone and distant
Like a solitary field
In some nameless foreign land.
All around him points of light
Start to dim and cease transmitting
Shadows fell on futile games
And then there was nothing more.
Through the screams of falling steel
By the light of flares and wisdom
All the doubts I could not face
All this time I wanted more.

As a symbol of beginning
To the gods whose names we've lost
And the names who gave in vain.

I have never wanted more.

Set me aflame and cast me free
Away you wretched world of tethers
Through the endless night and day
I have never wanted more.
Always thought that I would stand
Before the faceless name of Justice
Like some law unto myself
Like a child of God again.

And if rain brings winds of change
Let it rain on us forever
I have no doubts from what I've seen
I have never wanted more.
With this line I'll mark the past
As a symbol of beginning
I have no doubt from what I've seen
I have never wanted more.

Sever the line to the guilty past
To the ones who brought us nothing
Spoke of futures brave and proud
And brought only hate and war.
Lined the roads with hollow praise
Marked the land with paper statues
Shadows fell on their futile ways
And then there was nothing more",Solitary,2015

Filth,"When I saw her, I saw love for the first time
I talked to her, I heard love for the first time
When I touched her, I felt love for the first time
Love is something special to have
17 years old nothing to lose, 17 years old everything to learn
17 years old, everything to lose 17 years old nothing to learn
Yes, relationship is give and take, But I couldn't give enough, 
Still I loved every day of it
A year of my life away from the friends that I love
They loved me enough to never forget me
I love her and she taught me a lot, but that bitch won't get out of my life...",Hate,1994
Filthboy,"Overkill enough is enough
There's nothing left of me to
Devour
You've had your fill I'm all I
Have left

For power
'Cos you took advantage of
Things that I said
Now the feeling is dead

And that's the ultimate sin
And that's the ultimate sin

Anyway I look at it now
The doors are closed and
Cannot be opened
Bury your anger and bury
Your dead
Or you'll be left with nothing
And no one
Or you'll be left with nothing
And no one
There's no point in screaming
'Cos you won't be heard
Now that tables have turned

It was the ultimate sin
It was the ultimate sin
It was the ultimate sin

I warned you then and I'm
Warning you now
If you mess with me you're
Playing with fire
Winds of change that are
Fanning the flames
Will carry you to your
Funeral pyre
It's pulling you down
It's your final descent
It's too late to repent

When it's the ultimate sin
When it's the ultimate sin
When it's the ultimate sin",Ultimate Sin,1998

Fuck the present let's live the past

I waited and I watched and I lived my life in peace

You and all your friends feasted while we fought to make ends meet

And I see you everywhere
And I, I'd be really surprised
If I got to see you in the new morning

Makes it so damn hard to forget about the things
You do
And you, you seem think is cool

Fin Phranklin,"I fetch his slippers, fill up the pipe he smokes
I cook the kippers, laugh at his oldest jokes
Yet here I anchor, I might have had a banker
Boy! what love has done to me
His nature's funny, quarrelsome half the time
And as for money, he hasn't got a dime
And here's the joker, I might have had a broker
Boy! what love has done to me
When a guy looks my way
Does he get emphatic, say he gets dramatic?
I just want to fly 'way
But if I left him I'd be all at sea
I'm just a slavey, life is a funny thing
He's got the gravy, I got a wedding ring
And still I love him, there's nobody above him
Boy! what love has done to me
His brains are minus,
Never a thought in sight

And yet his highness
Lectures me day and night;
Oh where was my sense
To sign that wedding license?
Boy! What love has done to me!
My life he's wrecking, bet you could find him now
Out somewhere necking somebody else's frau
You get to know life when married to a low life
Boy! what love has done to me
I can't hold my head up
The butcher, the baker, oh no he's a faker
Brother I am fed up
But if I left him he'd be up a tree
Where will it wind up, I don't know where I'm at
I make my mind up, I oughta leave him flat
But I have grown so, I love that dirty so-and-so
Boy! what love has done to me.","Yo Wannit Bad, Boy?",

Always with dubs, 5 and 10's, cappin' battles of Don

But you know I never pay for the head and ass
Were my niggas at? gettin' lap dances
Smiles on they face, feel good my niggas be laced
Used to be on the block, just sellin' they rocks
Now they chillin' with me gettin' legal knots
Double L techs, ain't nigga be Vex
Rockin' ice burn, never too good to wear Guess
Makin' it happen, seein' my niggas makin' it rappin'
While ya niggas be broke and ya never be laughin'

Don't you know we still have our ties to the projects

And every nigga that you hang with, ain't ya fam
See a snake like a mile away, niggas say I'm weak now
And I ain't even hungry
So listen up, yo this is what I gotta say
I still hungry yo I eat like twice a day
But ya can suck my dick like Mart LeMay
Cool and honest, now a nigga really be arogent
My nigga Outlaw who used to live up in Faragent
We got niggas from all around the world
We even got hoes now, better ask ya girl
We can drink with weed, I'll make ya hurl
Straight twisted, with hydro and how ya be lifted
I told you to hit it light, before ya hit it
But you ain't listen so ya ass is corse
But you can't hang with me 'cause ya ass is soft

Three is for pops and shit, rest in peace mambo

Soon as 'Pone came home, yo he cop the Caddie
Tell Bob My Weave, we doin' are thing
And we got like a whole lotta money to bring
Do are thing with the bent, plus we grown as men
Feedin' like 15 niggas, that's next to kin
Sprung niggas out the hood with us
Yo when we do shows, we still got the hood with us
I know you love that, see us on stage, all drunk, with a thug hat
Mic check, so much henny moet
That's BK on the wheels, cuttin' up the steels
The niggas bring gats still, just to keep a rep
So don't disrespect, ya won't see the tech
Mano-a-mano, probably see ya niggas tomorrow

On the stage, on my own
Whenever said my words
Wishing they would be heard
I saw you smiling at me
Was it real, or just my fantasy?
You'd always be there in the corner
Of this tiny little bar

My last night here for you
Same old songs, just once more
My last night here with you?
Maybe yes, maybe no
I kind of liked it your way
How you shyly placed your eyes on me
Oh, did you ever know
That I had mine on you?

Darling, so there you are
With that look on your face
As if you're never hurt
As if you're never down
Shall I be the one for you
Who pinches you softly but sure?
If frown is shown, then
I will know that you are no dreamer

So let me come to you
Close as I wanted to be
Close enough for me
To feel your heart beating fast
And stay there as I whisper
How I loved your peaceful eyes on me
Did you ever know
That I had mine on you?

Darling, so share with me
Your love if you have enough
Your tears if you're holding back
Or pain if that's what it is
How can I let you know
I'm more than the dress and the voice
Just reach me out, then
You will know that you are not dreaming

Darling, so there you are
With that look on your face

As if you're never down

Finbar & Eddie Furey,"Near by the swelling ocean,
One morning in the month of June,
While feather'd warbling songsters
Their charming notes did sweetly tune,
I overheard a lady

Lamenting in sad grief and woe,
And talking with young Bonaparte
Concerning the bonny Bunch of Roses, O.

Thus spake the young Napoleon,
And grasp'd his mother by the hand:-
""Oh, mother dear have patience,
Till I am able to command

I'll raise a numerous army,
And through tremendous dangers go,
And in spite of all the universe,
I'll gain the bonny Bunch of Roses, O.""

Oh, son, speak not so venturesome
For England is the heart of oak
Of England, Scotland, and Ireland,
The unity can ne'er be broke.
And think you on your father

In the Island where he now lies low,
He is not yet interred in France,
So beware of the bonny Bunch of Roses, O.

Your father raised great armies,
And likewise kings did join the throng,
He was so well provided.
Enough to sweep the world along.

But when he went to Moscow,
He was o'erpower'd by drifting snow,
And though Moscow was blazing
He lost the bonny Bunch of Roses, O.

""Oh, mother, adieu for ever,
I am now on my dying bed,
If I had liv'd I'd have been brave
But now I droop my youthful head.

And when our bones do moulder,
And weeping-willows o'er us grow,
Its deeds to bold Napoleon
Will stain the bonny Bunch of Roses, O.""",The Bonny Bunch of Roses,1992
Finbar & Eddie Furey,"I'll Take You Home Again, Kathleen
Across the ocean wild and wide
To where your heart has ever been
Since first you were my bonnie bride.
The roses all have left your cheek.
I've watched them fade away and die
Your voice is sad when e'er you speak
And tears bedim your loving eyes.

Refrain:
|: Oh! I will take you back, Kathleen
   To where your heart will feel no pain
   And when the fields are fresh and green
   I'II take you to your home again! :|

I know you love me, Kathleen, dear
Your heart was ever fond and true.
I always feel when you are near
That life holds nothing dear, but you.
The smiles that once you gave to me
I scarcely ever see them now
Though many, many times I see
A dark'ning shadow on your brow.
Refrain:

To that dear home beyond the sea
My Kathleen shall again return.
And when thy old friends welcome thee
Thy loving heart will cease to yearn.
Where laughs the little silver stream
Beside your mother's humble cot
And brightest rays of sunshine gleam
There all your grief will be forgot.

And all the streets were dark and bare. 
In our town, no scarlet ribbons, 
Not one ribbon for her hair.

And just before the dawn was breaking, 
I peeked in and on her bed, 
In gay profusion lying there, 
Lovely ribbons, scarlet ribbons. 
Scarlet ribbons for her hair.

I will never, never know from where, 
Came those lovely scarlet ribbons,

I didn't feel like asking her to stay

Perhaps if we had talked, he'd have seen something in me

Finbar Furey,"Oh, Mary, this London's a wonderful sight
With people here working by day and by night
They don't sow potatoes, nor barley nor wheat
But there' gangs of them digging for gold in the streets
At least when I asked them that's what I was told
So I just took a hand at this diggin' for gold
But for all that I found there I might as well be
Where the Mountains of Mourne sweep down to the sea. 
I believe that when writin' a wish you expressed
As to how the fine ladies in London were dressed
Well, if you believe me, when asked to a ball
Faith, they don't wear no top to their dresses at all.
Oh, I've seen them myself and you could not in trath
Say if they were bound for a ball or a bath
Don't be startin' them fashions now, Mary Macree,
Where the mountains of Mourne sweep down to the sea. 

I've seen England's king from the top of a bus
And I've never known him, but he means to know us.
And tho' by the Saxon we once were oppressed,
Still I cheered, God forgive me, I cheered with the rest.
And now that he's visited Erin's green shore
We'll be much better friends than we've been heretofore
When we've got all we want, we're as quiet as can be
Where the mountains of Mourne sweep down to the sea. 

You remember young Peter O'Loughlin, of course
Well, now he is here at the head of the force
I met him today, I was crossing the Strand
And he stopped the whole street with a wave of his hand
And there we stood talkin' of days that are gone
While the whole population of London looked on
But for all these great powers he's wishful like me
To be back where the dark Mourne sweeps down to the sea. 

There's beautiful girls here, oh, never you mind
With beautiful shapes nature never designed
And lovely complexions all roses and cream
But O'Loughlin remarked with regard to the same
That if at those roses you venture to sip
The colours might all come away on your lip
So I'll wait for the wild rose that's waitin' for me
Where the Mountains of Mourne sweep down to the sea.

Left me at the pad with his girl, damn, what the deal?

As she slid downstairs, now she taking me down home
Cheating in the next room in the homeboy's bedroom
Am I wrong?  Shit, on and on and on and on
Now what am I to do if you was me and I was you
His baby momma in my face, she shaking poo-poo, what would you do?

I'll make the hardest move you know turn softer than a pillow
Best thing to do, don't get caught in the middle
Why? the sicko click, WHAT? don't say shit

Step in you guppies, it's better if you don't trust me
You might hate me, but your girl and your kids love me
Life's a bitch, and then WHAT? then you die
That's on the real homie
You don't know me and I like it like that
A Name You Kan't Touch, you got a problem with that
Now mind your own, If WHAT? if you want to live long
That's how it goes hater

We quick to pull your card motherfucker
So watch your back, real gangstas smash
We be comin for ya

Fingazz,"Hey girl don't you know
Money buys almost anything
But it can't buy real love.

I see you everyday but you never look at me
You're always looking good but you look unhappy
Tell me why you choose to live like this
If you were mine I'd never make you feel like this
You need a man not someone that's gonna hurt you
You need to let him go he doesn't deserve you
And when I say I'll make you happy it's true
Or you could stay with your man
And get your heart broken too
But here's my number call me up if you want
And when you feel lonely you could roll through my spot
See I ain't trippin' homies lost in my game
Nobody know's it til we say 'cause I'm ahead of the game
'Cause I'm a king what I need is a queen I could have a million dollars but it won't mean a thing
Now I ain't rich but I'll tell you one thing
I could give you more happiness then money can bring

Now I don't drive a fancy car,
No diamond in my pinkie ring
Barely make enough to get me by
Nothing left for material things
But hey girl don't you know money buys almost anything
But it can't buy real love

I want to be you're only one
And you could be mine too
'Cause baby I'm going crazy
When I think about you
I get excited when I see you come through
Nobody else made me feel the way that you do
I need a woman not a girl
Not just someone to fuck
I don't mean no disrespect
But that's wassup
I see you smile when I talk like that
It seems like it's been a while since you smiled like that
But maybe we can kick it
You spend a little time
Sit down one-on-one
And let you know what's on my mind
I know a good thing when I see it
And I see it in you
So tell me what I gotta do to make you feel the same too
Because I'm a king what I need is a queen
I could have a million dollars
But it won't mean a thing
Now I ain't rich
But I can tell you one thing
I can give you more happiness
Then money can bring
And that's real

Now I don't drive a fancy car,
No diamond in my pinkie ring
Barely make enough to get me by
Nothing left for material things
But hey girl don't you know money buys almost anything
But it can't buy real love

That's all I've got to give my heart and soul to you
Only way I wanna live sharing each moment with you
Take it fast take it slow girl you know it's real this time (so real)
Don't let true love pass you by baby

Now I don't drive a fancy car,
No diamond in my pinkie ring
Barely make enough to get me by
Nothing left for material things
But hey girl don't you know money buys almost anything
But it can't buy real love

So real",Real Love,2006

Hi daddy!
What are you doing?
Um will you come and pick me up righ' now?
Oh I can't pick you up right now
I'm busy I gotta go uh record a song right now
I'll pick you up after I get out of the studio OK?
Mm hm
I love you
I love you daddy
Aight I'm a go back to work right now OK?
Ok
I gotta go make that money for us
I love you
Be careful and behave alright.

We do what we gotta do to make it through these hard times
I'm drugling and hustling I'm always on the grind inside
Why can't I get away somebody take me away (to a better place)
Everything will be OK
Why can't I get away somebody take me away (to a better place)
Everything will be OK

I remember when I'm gonna sing this
Fix this barely got money to put food in the kitchen
After working hard trying make ends meets
Best believe to any life next week
Lyrics
But no one gonna hold me down
And this I swear to myself
Nobody gonna get the best of me
Cause I need nobody's help
And that for sure
I hold my own thing and do my own thing
I ain't gonna stop til I'll top and
Drop and resting in peace
I know I gotta stay strong
So I don't breck and my kids say
Daddy gotta make that bank
And if I die before I wake
I pry the lord my sole to take
Cause never will I give 'em
Never will I fell them because

We do what we gotta do to make it through these hard times
I'm drugling and hustling I'm always on the grind inside
Why can't I get away somebody take me away (to a better place)
Everything will be OK
Why can't I get away somebody take me away (to a better place)
Everything will be OK

No matter what I do I never seems to be enough
They try to hold me down
But I get back up
My mind stay tough
When the time get rough
So I gotta take a puff on this purple stuff
I can't sleep I still up in the late night
I'm thinking about my move for the day light
There no left so I get my pay right
One false move they send straight to the cage right
I still live the same up in the street gangs
I spend awhile everyday trying to maintain
I still try to get up on my feet
Still trying to fly away
Still trying to spread my wings
But no matter what I'm never gonna give up
I gotta stay up both water in my head up
Even thou time are rough and you fed up
We gotta do what it take to get up

We do what we gotta do to make it through these hard times
I'm drugling and hustling I'm always on the grind inside
Why can't I get away somebody take me away (to a better place)
Everything will be OK
Why can't I get away somebody take me away (to a better place)
Everything will be OK

Waking up in the morning everyday
With the same thought
Is the pain and the rain ever gonna stop
Will I make it through the day without getting shot
Or will the way of the world get me caught
Up in the mix down were I can't move
Do what I do if someone walks in my shoes
I give it up to cause work nine to five
Keep on doing what you doing to survive your life
But what would you do if your sons was at home
Crying on the floor cause
He left alway alone wishing he could fly away
Every single night cause his dad is in prison and
His mom on the pipe
Will that be enough to get you back on your feet
Or knowing that he ain't got food to eat
We do what we gotta do to make it throug these hard time
I always on the grind I gotta get mine

We do what we gotta do to make it through these hard times
I'm drugling and hustling I'm always on the grind inside
Why can't I get away somebody take me away (to a better place)
Everything will be OK
Why can't I get away somebody take me away (to a better place)
Everything will be OK",Take Me Away,2006
Fingazz,"They all are yellin' out freeze
As I'm on these backstreets gettin' mine
Dodgin' the law, dodgin' it sublime
And if you feel me, I'm a keep it real for this episode

Makin' you raw and do some critical overload
What must I do to live in the City of Angels?
Like a fucker, who unclockin' the chamber
'Cause it remains to be the same to me
I gotta be an OG like my daddy and my grand peppy

Don't ever touch mine, don't ever disrespect mine
Better get out to protect in case you ever cross the line
Yo, I'm like the crow, no dumb birdy
As I handle my business and as I take you on the journey

It ain't no City of the Angels, brother Mack
It's just people playin' get back and more get back
Yo, a lotta drama on my block, but I never stress
Because I'm build like a Presidential Rolex

A lotta people got over the red, over the blue
A lotta people hustle 'cause they got to
But if I ever go out before I'm supposed to go
I'm gonna revenge myself like The Crow

L.A. is sure a crazy ass place to stay
Where the riders ride and the players play
I've been around the world and around the way
24-7 like everyday

L.A. is sure a crazy ass place to stay
Where the riders ride and the players play
I've been around the world and around the way
24-7 like everyday

I see the clock struck half past
I'm movin' fast with a blast
I'm like an angel in the city with the devil's path
And everybody's out to get me
So I quickly stick and move
And if he moves I trip, my fingers itch

I got a vision, I'm on a mission, listen
I can hear 'em, but I can't trust my intuition
I'm wishin' upon that midnight mystical
And through the darkness I'm hopin' for a miracle

I can't holler 'till you hear me
I gotta get me through the madness
Even though I'm guilty
And as I reload I'm all alone, set to explode
Like an unlogical murderer that's in the zone

I know they workin', the spirit's lurkin', I'm hurtin'
The triple six with the kiss got my soul searchin'
Then I woke and I choked on a cloud of smoke
It was a dream and in my dream I'd seen a black crow

L.A. is sure a crazy ass place to stay
Where the riders ride and the players play
I've been around the world and around the way
24-7 like everyday

L.A. is sure a crazy ass place to stay
Where the riders ride and the players play
I've been around the world and around the way
24-7 like everyday

Another day in L.A. comes to an end
The dark of the night starts to set in
Lots of deals goin' down under the city lights

Welcome to the city of drag where my pants sag
And the homies still relyin' on the flag
Yeah, life starts to twist and turn
Then they hit you at another angle
Just some more drama in the City of Angels

Violence is brought forth too many years
Fuckin' memories, we cried so many tears
Oh, the devil plays the repo man
And he's suckin' up souls as fast as he can

It's no question, it's in our nature
A .45 brings out the criminal behavior
When the clouds in the sky turn black and gloom
As soon as the smoke starts to fill the room

Your heart starts to beat, it's like a ritual
And the feelin' that you get is somewhat spiritual
I'm a have to let you know how reality go
Learn to fly like The Crow as you slide into limbo

L.A. is sure a crazy ass place to stay
Where the riders ride and the players play
I've been around the world and around the way
24-7 like everyday

L.A. is sure a crazy ass place to stay
Where the riders ride and the players play
I've been around the world and around the way

It's summer time and I'm feelin' so good, 
Wake up in the mornin' with the player's groove, 
The weather's hot and I'm in my drop top 
Me and my friends rollin' through the parking lot, 
Today's a good day so call out the DJ, 
Bring the Gatorade, it's a sunny day 
Love the way I'm so fresh and so clean 
Out in the sunshine, you know what I mean? 

(i don't know this line it's on 50-51 sec.) 
So it's time to chill 
I'm home and I'm relaxin' with the meat on the grill 
And for real, (whistle) the girl's lookin so fine 
Dressed to impress and the weather's ain't denied 
All the time, the homies bring the cars out, 
Black, white, brown, asians no doubt 
It's a holiday, it's a sunny day 
Summertime Anthem sing along hey!

It's still hot as I reach the mid-day, 
Water balloon fight, as the kids play 
Another day in the summer sunshine, 
Kites in the air as the food get's pre-pared! 
All the fella's looking for the pretty girls, 
(the pretty pretty girls out in the summer world), 
Like DJ Jazzy Jeff, and Fresh Prince, 
It's summer time again, let's reminice 
And how summer comes and goes and comes again, 
School's out, let's all have some fun again 
Everyone with the ringtones blowing up, 
It's the Summer Anthem song so you know what's up 
Play it loud, in the park, cruisin' in your ride, 
Everybody doing like these other kid times (?) 
Nevermind your problems, they go away 
It's summer time everyday is a good day

kickin' back to the Summertime Anthem, 
Cruisin' in your ride with the Summertime Anthem, 
I know your feelin' that Summertime Anthem, 
So get down with the Summertime Anthem 
Summerti-iime, Summerti-iime, 
Summertime, yeaah 
I know your feelin it, yeah hey 


(3rd verse) 

Now it's 6 o' clock and it's feelin so good, 
Summer breeze straining throughout the neighborhood, 
Time to pack up the bags, 
And the roll on now, 
Tempting the giggles with the music playin' loud 
Toastin, like it was 94' 
Remembering the boulevard after the car show, 
Damit, those were the good old days, 
But the summertime's back and it's time to play 


(Chorus...again) 


Cruisin in the summertime, baby, 
Homies in the park goin', crazy, 
Crusin' in the block with your, lady, 
In the, in the, in the sunshine 
Workin' like the summertime, baby 
Girl's lookin hot playa, face me 
I'm so fresh from cleanin' so they praise me 
In the, in the, in the sunshine

Lookin' back to the Summertime Anthem, 
Cruisin' in your ride with the Summertine Anthem,

'cause all I give you dirty tricks and that's it
No shame in the game I play
Me and Bash got pie to lay
Texas Californ-I-A
Smokin' weed, pokin' bitches all night and day
Ride away in the hot one
Put my hook in the sea then I caught one
I gotta take it or leave it
And believe it or not
I got the eye of an eagle and I spot them

Holiday Inn, Howard Johnson
Me and two friends like Charlie Bronson
Locked up in a suite in between sheets
Gang bangin' top nothes, huh
I'm the bossiest playa like the freak Steve Austin
I don't give a fuck what shit be costin'
Keep bad bitches, pretty friends be flossin'
Sex and the City every time we tossin'
Never leave the pad without packin' precaution
Frisco Mac, so proceed with caution
You and these dudes are in these streets is often
Blaze up a sack get the chronic often
Outlaw on the run come ? me none
Don Cisco baby
When I ride, I'm bossin' on that ass
And ? rollin' pregnant
2-1-1 girl I like them odds
You can rock my world
I'll make you scream for the Gods
In between the sheets all night
I'll freak you hard
Keep it cool
What you speakin' on?
Shut your mouth and just tweak it on
Close your lips, leak you wrong

If it pleases or pains you
You should be allowed but you were beat out

Secrets swollen so sore

That shape of you
Closes in and forms a shade of grey

If I believe I'm dreaming

And if they find you lost again
What will you tell them then

Collapsing in again you found what makes it sore
You triggered off the feelings that you felt before

I come crawling up again I need to eat I need a friend

Finn Brothers,"It's a slow parade
Down a dusty road
We've learned to take abuse
From devils we don't know

People who have lost all heart
Look for someone else to blame
You just keep on walking
When they call you a dirty name

All the mud in this town
All the dirt in this world
None of it sticks on you

You shake it off
'Cause you're better than that
And you don't need it
There's nothing wrong with you

The moment that we dread
It comes all too soon
Voices in your head
Still carry on the tune

Let the sound come in
From the world outside
You just keep on singing
When they tell you filthy lies

All the mud in this town
All the dirt in this world
None of it sticks on you

You shake it off
'Cause you're better than that
And you don't need it
There's nothing wrong with you

Remember how it made you hurt
Even as you fight to go on
Turn it into something else
Turn it into something else

All the mud in this town
All the dirt in this world
None of it sticks on you

You shake it off
'Cause you're better than that
And you don't need it
No, you don't believe it

All the mud in this town
All the dirt in this world
None of it sticks on you

You shake it off
'Cause you're better than that
And you don't need it

There's nothing wrong with you
No

There's nothing wrong with you
There's nothing wrong with you
There's nothing wrong with you

Finn Brothers,"Over these green hills, blue electric light
Always in my blood, forever in my eyes
Black window space a basket made of flax
Broken mirror view, let your eyes relax

Mist on my glass
Watch it all come to pass
Once again, we'll breathe in the view
It's part of me, part of you

Now my voice won't sing and my tears won't cry
Your disciple waits for any good advice
Our place in time, it's not set in stone
And we'll still be here where the cows come home

Mist on my glass
Watch it all come to pass
Once again, we'll breathe in the view
It's part of me, part of you

And it has to be clear, inside my head
And I'm still in a dream, in a dream that won't end
Once again, we'll breathe in the view
It's part of me, part of you

Mist on my glass
Watch it all come to pass
Once again, we'll breathe in the view

You promise someone

Or whatever may come

It means that I won't give in,
Won't give in
Won't give in

Say it once, and disappear.

With people I call
My own.

Is just a flicker of light

Die alone.

When you carry it on.

I can see it in you.

Come on now
Come on now

The right place
Right now
Turn around.

Finn Hauge,"The night is like a lovely tune
Beware my foolish heart
How white the ever constant moon
Take care my foolish heart

There's a line between love and fascination
That's hard to see, how many names such as this
For they both have the very same sensation
When you're locked in the magic of a kiss

Her lips are much too close to mine
Beware my foolish heart
But should our eager lips combine
Then let the fire start

For this time it isn't fascination
Or a dream that will fade and fall apart
It's love, this time it's love

Finn Kalvik,"I was a highwayman along the coach roads I did ride with sword and pistol by my side
Many a young maid lost her baubles to my trade
Many a soldier shed his lifeblood on my blade
The bastards hung me in the spring of twenty-five but I am still alive.

I was a sailor. I was born upon the tide and with the sea I did abide.
I sailed a schooner round the Horn to Mexico
I went aloft and furled the mainsail in a blow
And when the yards broke off they said that I got killed but I am living still.

I was a dam builder across the river deep and wide where steel and water did collide
A place called Boulder on the wild Colorado
I slipped and fell into the wet concrete below
They buried me in that great tomb that knows no sound
But I am still around I will always be around

I fly a starship across the Universe divide and when I reach the other side
I will find a place to rest my spirit if I can perhaps I may become a highwayman again
Or I may simply be a single drop of rain but I will remain and I will be back again",Fredløs,1993

Said I do to love,
Don't ever call again.
For I must have you

I've locked my heart.
I keep my feelings there.
I have stopped my heart
Like an icy frigidaire.
For I need to care for no one.
That's why I'm thru with love.

To think that you cared.
You didn't need me.
You have your share
of slaves around you
To hound you and swear

a new day is dawning sunny and bright.
But after I've been crying all night the sun is cold
and the new day seems old.
Since I lost my baby, since I lost my baby.

Birds are singing and the children are playing,
there's plenty of work and the bosses are paying.
Not a sad word should my young heart be saying,
but fun is a bore and with money I'm poor.
Since I lost my baby, since I lost my baby.

Next time I'll be kinder, won't you please help me find her?
Someone just remind her 'bout this love she left behind her.
'Til I find her I'll be tryin' now, ev'ry day I'm  more inclined to find her,
inclined to find her, inclined to find my baby.
Been a-looking ev'rywhere, baby, I really, really care.

Oh, determination is fading fast. . . Inspiration is a thing of the past. . .
Can't see my hope's gonna last. . .
good things are bad and what's happy is sad.

Fiona Fullerton,"What do the simple folk do
To help them escape when they're blue?
The shepherd who is ailing, the milkmaid who is glum
The cobbler who is wailing from nailing his thumb

When they're beset and besieged
The folk not noblessly obliged
However do they manage to shed their weary lot?
Oh, what do simple folk do, we do not?

I have been informed by those who know them well
They find relief in quite a clever way
When they're sorely pressed, they whistle for a spell
And whistling seems to brighten up their day

And that's what simple folk do, so they say
They just whistle?
So they say

What else do the simple folk do
To pluck up the heart and get through?
The wee folk and the grown folk
Who wander to and fro

Have ways known to their own folk
We throne folk don't know
When all the doldrums begin
What keeps each of them in his skin?

What ancient native custom
Provides the needed glow?
Oh, what do simple folk do?, Do you know?

Once, upon the road, I came upon a lad
Singing in a voice three times his size
When I asked him why, he told me he was sad
And singing always made his spirits rise

So that's what simple folk do, I surmise

Arise my love, arise my love
Apollo's lighting the skies, my love
The meadows shine with columbine
And daffodils blossom away

Hear Venus call to one and all
Come taste delight while you may
The world is bright and all is right
And life is merry and gay

What else do the simple folk do?
They must have a system or two
They obviously outshine us at turning tears to mirth
Have tricks a royal highness is minus from birth

What, then, I wonder, do they
To chase all the goblins away?
They have some tribal sorcery you haven't mentioned yet
Oh, what do simple folk do to forget?

Often, I am told, they dance a fiery dance
And whirl 'till they're completely uncontrolled
Soon the mind is blank and all are in a trance
A violent trance astounding to behold

And that's what simple folk do, so I'm told
Really?
I have it on the best authority

The phantom of the opera is there,
Inside my mind

My power over you
Grows stronger yet
And though you turn from me
To glance behind
The phantom of the opera is here

Draw back in fear
I am the mask you wear

In one combined

Fionn Regan,"I still see you as a baby, I do
Climbing onto the stage in front of the school
High strung
The cat got your tongue
The spotlight came out 
You'd been strung
I followed the trail 
when I heard that they found 
you in the cowshed
I still see the insect filled jars in rows
The calculations and the diagrams, constellations
High strung
The cat got your tongue
The spotlight came out
You'd been hung
I followed the trail 
when I heard that they found
You in the cowshed",The Cowshed,2006
Fionn Regan,"I feel your sorrow chasing tomorrow
There is no distance in your absence
If you call the monsters they will appear
Like I disappear Blackout
There is resistance behind enemy lines
There goes the hatred bursting through the fabric
If you call the monsters they will appear
Like I disappear Blackout
You are here
You are here
You are here
