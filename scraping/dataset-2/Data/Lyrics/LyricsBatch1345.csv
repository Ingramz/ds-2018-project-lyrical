Brandy Clark,"You can come over
You can sit on the back porch
We can take a walk
When it gets colder
You can climb in my car
Yeah, we can talk
Sit up all night if you like
I just can't let your restless feet
Find my front steps

It'd be too easy
To throw open that door
And go where we've gone
Too many times before
You'd stay just long enough
To leave me again
So you can come over
But you can't come in

I'd put on that record
You'd give me that look
Oh, you know the one
Boy, I can betcha
By the end of that first verse
The damage would be done
'Cause one glass of wine always leads to two
When it comes to me and you

It'd be too easy
To throw open that door
And go where we've gone
Too many times before
You'd stay just long enough
To leave me again
So you can come over
But you can't come in

And pretend like we're just a couple old friends
Like you don't know how our story ends
You'd stay just long enough
To leave me again
So you can come over
But 'til I get over you
You can't come in",You Can Come Over,2016
Brandy Clark,"When you took me home
You knew who you were taking
Not some Debbie debutante standing in an apron
Frying up your bacon

My house and my mouth and my mind get kinda trashy
I've never been to jail, but Hell, I wouldn't put it past me, so

If you want the girl next door
Some Virgin Mary metaphor
Your cardboard cutout on the wall
Your paper or your Barbie doll
With perfect hair and a perfect dress
I'm really just the perfect mess
And I ain't nothing less or nothing more
So, baby, if you want the girl next door

Then go next door and go right now
And don't look back, don't turn around
And don't call me when you get bored
Yeah, if you want the girl next door
Then go next door

Sorry I ain't sorry
That I ain't your Marsha Brady, uh-uh
If I ever met her, bet she'd probably hate me
'Cause you'd wanna date me

My heart and my head and my bed can get real twisted
And you wouldn't be the first to think you could go and fix it

If you want the girl next door
Some Virgin Mary metaphor
Your cardboard cutout on the wall
Your paper or your Barbie doll
With perfect hair and a perfect dress
I'm really just the perfect mess
And I ain't nothing less or nothing more
So, baby, if you want the girl next door

Then go next door and go right now
And don't look back, don't turn around
And don't call me when you get bored
Yeah, if you want the girl next door
Then go next door

The thing that turns you on is what you wanna change
But you have a better chance of slowing down a train

If you want the girl next door
Some Virgin Mary metaphor
Your cardboard cutout on the wall
Your paper or your Barbie doll
With perfect hair and a perfect dress
I'm really just the perfect mess
And I ain't nothing less or nothing more
So, baby, if you want the girl next door

Then go next door and go right now
And don't look back, don't turn around
And don't call me when you get bored
Yeah, if you want the girl next door
Then go next door",Girl Next Door,2016
Brandy Clark,"Love can go to your head
Like a shot of something strong
Love can go to your bed
And stay there all night long

Love can go on and on
Like a Sunday morning Sparrow
Love can go to your heart
Like a sweet-talking arrow

Love can go to hell 
In a broken heartbeat minute
That's where I am without you in it
Every day is just another night by myself
Love can go to hell
Like roses in a vase of whiskey
Dying for the way you used to kiss me
Heaven knows I only wish you well
Oh, but love, yeah love 
Can go to hell

I can go to church
And fold these idle hands
I can go to work
Call some friends
Make some plans

I can get drunk on a Saturday night
And try to fall for someone new
But I'd just wake up hungover
Cursing the day I feel for you

Love can go to hell 
In a broken heartbeat minute
That's where I am without you in it
Every day is just another night by myself
Love can go to hell
Like roses in a vase of whiskey
Dying for the way you used to kiss me
Heaven knows I only wish you well

I don't blame you at all
No, I don't hate you at all
It's all love's fault

So, love can go to hell 
In a broken heartbeat minute
That's where I am without you in it
Every day is just another night by myself
Love can go to hell
Like roses in a vase of whiskey
Dying for the way you used to kiss me
Heaven knows I only wish you well
Oh, but love, yeah love 
Can go to hell

Forever's just a lie that love will tell
So love
Yeah love can go to hell",Love Can Go to Hell,2016
Brandy Clark,"She's got three kids, no husband
She's two weeks late on last month's rent
She's waitin' on the child support 
He keeps swearin' that it's coming
But if she knows him, she knows where it went
And that pile o' bills ain't gonna pay themselves

It's been a forty-hour week and it's only Tuesday
And there's homework and dinner to make
Somebody wants a lullaby
Somebody wants a different channel
Somebody's dealin' with their first heartbreak
And the dishes in the sink ain't gonna wash themselves

She lights a cigarette out on the balcony
When she gets a couple minutes to herself
There's how you plan it out, and how it turns out to be
And a broken home, it ain't no fairytale

She's got three kids, no husband
And a hairnet job at a diner down on Main
She knows damn well
She don't make the best cup o' coffee
But she's quick with a smile and good with names
Those lunch tickets ain't gonna tip themselves

She smokes a cigarette out by the loading dock
And tries not to pick the polish off her nails
She thinks about a guy who's been coming in a lot
She starts to dream and then she stops herself

She's got three kids, no husband
So she's a mom and a dad and a taxi driver
When the baby's sick, she's an up-all-nighter
A hand and a shoulder and a referee
A real-life hero if you ask me
'Cause those kids ain't gonna raise themselves",Three Kids No Husband,2016
Brandy Hambrick,"Inny, meeny, minny mo

I'm like inny, meeny, minny, mo
How many niggas from the club won't go?
(I know you saw it, I know you see it)

Now you can call me tip drill, they playing my song
Throw a couple ones, then she throw away her thong
When she bust it open, take a picture with my phone
She love my cologne, I call it perk body zone
Now she pussy poppin'; it's goin' down
Slap the waitress on the booty, tell her ""get another round""
And when I make it rain money all over the ground
Fresh force ones, Sean John button down
And then I'm like ""Oh, boy, a clique full a stars""
Big four fifth, big dick, and big cars
At the end of the day, when it's all said and done
I need four freaks 'cause I need more than one

Inny, meeny, minny, mo

I ain't never been the type to show off in the club
Real laid back, poppin' plenty bottles of
Bub, don't smoke, but I got much perk
Get that nigga real high, make him slurp it then burp
Could you be a groupie? 
I hear you singin' my song
Like I see you, lemme feel your tongue
It's T, miss B nigga, let me get you laced
Take a step back, blow the pussy in ya face
I ain't talking kush, nigga, I'm talking a rat race
So many to choose from, give 'em all a little taste
Gotta house full a pussy, the madam of hip hop
My bitches are superstars, so gushy you need a mop
Yeah

I got stacks on deck, snowflakes on my neck
New J's on my feet, make my outfit complete

Brandy Johnson,"can you find the time to open up your mind 
and listen to every line that you're sending 
i'm pretending that I don't seem to mind 
when you loosen up your tie and 
roll out another word from your hand
but now i know 
just what every high roller holds
it's too much to show so let it go 

do you realize when you look at what's inside and 
you hold on to every lie that you're sending
did you mean it when you said 
i don't mean to pry 
and you let out one more sigh 
and roll out another word from your heart
but now i know 
just what every high roller holds
it's too much to show so let it go 

i won't let you know what it means to be right 
and i won't let it go till the seams bust light

Brandy Moss-Scott,"Now if there's a smile upon my face 
it's only there trying to fool the public
but when it comes down to fooling you 
now honey that's quite a diff'rent subject
Don't let my glad expression 
give you the wrong impression really I'm sad
Oh, sadder than sad, you're gone and I'm hurting so bad
like a clown I pretend to be glad
 
Now there's some sad things known to man 
but ain't too much sadder than
the tears of a clown, when there's no one around
Oh yeah, baby,
 
Now if I appear to be carefree, 
it's only to camouflage my sadness
in order to shield my pride 
I try to cover this hurt with a show of gladness
But Don't let my show convince you 
that I've been happy since you decided to go,
I need you so, I'm hurt and I want you to know
but for others I put on a show
 
Now there's some sad things known to man 
but ain't too much sadder than
the tears of a clown,
when there's no one around
 
Just like Pagliacci did
I try to keep my sadness hid
smiling in the public eye
but in my lonely room I cry 
the tears of a clown
Oh, yeah baby
 
Now, if there's a smile on my face
Don't let my glad expression
Give you a wrong impression
Don't let this smile I wear
Make you think that I don't care

but ain't too much sadder than
the tears of a clown, when there's no one around",Tears of a Clown,2000
Branford Marsalis,"Let the drums roll out
Let the trumpet call
While the people shout, ""strike up the band""

Calling one and all

I'm gonna get to know you better
This Christmas
And as we trim the tree
How much fun it's gonna be together
This Christmas

Fireside is blazing bright
We're caroling through the night
And this Christmas will be

Branford Marsalis,"You can never tell what’s in a man’s mind
And if he’s from Harlem, there’s no use of even tryin’
Just like the tide, his mind comes and goes
Like March weather, when he’ll change
Nobody knows, nobody knows

The man I love, well, he just turned me down, he’s a Harlem brown
Off times I wish that I were in this ground, six feet underground
He idolized me, as no other could, no, no
Then he surprised me, leavin’ me a note sayin’ he’s gone for good
Gone for good

And since my sweetie left me,
Harlem, well, it ain’t the same old place
Though a thousand dandies smile right in my face
I think I’ll mooch some homemade hooch and go out for a lark
Just to drive off these mean ole Harlem Blues

You can have your Broadway, give me Lenox Avenue
Angels from the skies stroll 7th and for that thanks are due
From Madam Walker’s beauty shops to the Pro-Ro System 2
That made those girls angels without any doubt

There are some spots up in Harlem where I’m told it’s sudden death
To let somebody see you even stop to catch your breath
If you’ve never been to Harlem, then I guess you’ll never know
The power of these mean ole Harlem blues

Ah, there’s one sweet spot in Harlem known as Striver’s Row
‘Ditty folks come call them, one thing you should know
Is that I have a friend who lives there I know he won’t refuse
To put some music to my troubles and call ‘em Harlem blues

Branford Marsalis,"And I would like to play a
Little tune I just composed not so long ago
Ms. Billie Holiday
Byrd?
The music called Jazz

It's roots are in the sounds of the African
Or should I say the mother, bringin' us back again
From the drummin' on the Congo
We came with a strong flow and continue to grow

Feet move, to the beat of the t'balo
Now dig the story and follow
For then it landed, on American soil
Through the sweat, the blood and the toil

Hear, ""Praise the Lord,"" shouted on chain gangs
Pain they felt, but it helped them to maintain
Scott Joplin's rags, Bessie Smith's blues

St. Louis blues, they were all the news
Ringin' smooth in all the listener's ears
Fulfillin' the needs and plantin' the seeds of a jazz thing

King Oliver's group was a train comin' through
To Chicago, bringin' the New Orleans groove
And when Satchmo blew, the audience knew

Basil Street blues was the whole house tune
It was music, great to dance to
Great to romance to, with a lot to say to you
Relaying a message, revealing the essence of a jazz thing

Jazz music, jazz music
Jazz music, jazz music
Jazz music, jazz music, jazz music

In the 40's came be-bop, the first be-bop
The real be-bop, so let me talk about
Diz' and Byrd, givin' the word
Defining how a beat could be so complete

Playing with ferocity, thinkin' with velocity
About ornithology, or anthropology
And even [Incomprehensible], and this is real history

Theolonious Monk, a melodious thunk
No mistakes were made with the notes he played
His conception, was [Incomprehensible]

A star glowing bright among dim lights
The critics did cite that he sounded alright
Charlie Mingus, such nimble fingers
Droppin' the bass, all over the place

And Max Roach, cymbals socking
Bass drum talking, snare drum rocking
Restructuring the metaphysics of a jazz thing

John Coltrane, a man supreme
He was the cream, he was the wise one
The impression of Afro Blue and of the promise
That was not kept, he was a giant step

And there was Ornette Coleman
He was another soul man
The original invisible, playing great music
I wonder why the Bangles couldn't use it

Now listen see, the real mystery is how music history
Created by white men or any other white man
That pretended he originated

And contended that he innovated a jazz thing
Of course we know who can really blow
Scheamin' on the meaning of a jazz thing

And this music ain't dead, so don't be misled
By those who said that jazz was on it's deathbed
'Cause when Betty Carter sings a song
Ain't nuttin' goin' on, but simply good music
And you won't refuse it

She's takin' her time, makin' the nuances rhyme
Sonny Rollins, tenor saxophone
With a big old tone, recitin' poems
With notes as words and haven't you heard
Next stop butter, right past Oleo

Now there's young cats blowin'
And more and more people, yes they will be knowin'
Jazz ain't the past, this music's gonna last
And as the facts unfold, remember who foretold

The 90's, will be the decade of a jazz thing
I love jazz music
A jazz thing
I love jazz music
A jazz thing
I love jazz music

I love jazz music
A jazz thing

",Jazz Thing,1990
Branford Marsalis,"Black cats creep across my path
Until I'm almost mad
I must have 'roused the devil's wrath
Cause all my luck is bad
I make a date for golf and you can bet your life it rains
I try to give a party and the guy upstairs complains
I guess I'll go through life 
Just catchin' colds and missin' trains

Everything happens to me
I never miss a thing
I've had the measles and the mumps
And every time I play an ace
My partner always trumps
Guess I'm just a fool who never looks before he jumps

Everything happens to me
At first my heart thought you could break this jinx for me
That love would turn the trick to end despair
But know I just can't fool this head that thinks for me
I've mortgaged all my castles in the air
I've telegraphed and phoned
I send an ""Airmail Special"" too
Your answer was ""Goodbye""
And there was even postage due
I fell in love just once
And then it had to be with you

Everything happens to me",Everything Happens to Me,1991
Branford Marsalis,"Its not the pale moon that excites me
That thrills and delights me, oh no 
Its just the nearness of you 

It isn't your sweet conversation 
That brings this sensation, oh no 
Its just the nearness of you 

When you're in my arms and I feel you so close to me 
All my wildest dreams come true 

I need no soft lights to enchant me 
If you'll only grant me the right 
To hold you ever so tight 
And to feel in the night the nearness of you",The Nearness of You,1991
Branford Marsalis,"Oh honey hush, yes you talk too much
Oh honey hush, yes you talk too much
Listenin' to your conversation is just about to separate us

You start talkin' in the morning, you're talkin' all day long
I'm tryin' to figure out what I did wrong
Oh honey hush, yes you talk too much
Listenin' to your conversation is just about to separate us

I stay out all day long, you know I hate to come home
Everything I do, seems to be wrong
Oh honey hush, yes you talk too much
Listenin' to your conversation is just about to separate us

I can't eat, I can't sleep, I can't rest in peace
I'll be better off, you know, walkin' the streets
Oh honey hush, yes you talk too much
Listenin' to your conversation is just about to separate us

I come for lunch or dinner, it happens all the time
That little gal just drives me out of my mind
Oh honey hush, yes you talk too much
Listenin' to your conversation is just about to separate us",Honey Hush,1993

And the rice was gone oh hours ago 
And the white wheeled limousine's standing alone

Where the wine did flow oh he moved so slow 
But finally one night as the wind stood still 
He got up the nerve and she said ""I will"" 

The day did come and the groomsmen arrived 
Came a little early to go over their lines

Footsteps that you hear down the hall
The laugh that floats on a summer night

[Chorus]
Sometimes I tell myself
IÂ´m better off without you
And then I have to face the emptiness
I feel inside without you
And find a way to make it through another day

I need a way
to find the truth within me
Accept the fact that I love you
My blue eternity
I hear they say
What doesnÂ´t kill you makes you stronger
I must have the heart of a lion
Sifting through loveÂ´s remains

[Chorus]

My love for you is etched
Forever in my memory
Now I realize that life goes on
Even though youÂ´re not here with me
I wake up looking forward to another day
A day of living without you
Just another day",Another Day,1997
Branford Marsalis,"I know that I was not the one
To let my feelings show
In any way that mattered
The moment I felt

She might mean something to me
I would just run away
I felt that love was for the fool
Would tarnish any jewel

Turn a diamond to simple coal
Because in all my life
I never met that someone to make me feel love was right, alright

[Chorus]
Now I'll do most anything for you
To bring your love
Back into my empty world
You're the only girl I'm thinking of

Though I'll never know why you left this way
I'll try to understand
'Cause the moment you wee in my life
Made me better than I am

Now I see how issues from the past
Can manfest themselves
In your feelings for others
My bitter heart would poison loving souls of those

Who tried to come too close
And then you came into my life
And filled me with the strength
To face the pain inside me

Now that I've given you
The best part of my heart
I see you have your issues too
Your issues too

[Chorus]

Better than I am
I'm better than I am
Though I'll never know why you left this way
I'll try to understand

'Cause the moment you were in my life
Made me better than I am",Better Than I Am,1997

Black Monday
That's what this joint is all about
Black Monday
A million men strong without a doubt
Black Monday
It's not just a role that one plays
Black Monday
So we can have justice one day
Black Monday
Black, Black Monday

Hey Yo, be, I thougt we conquered the world
When a million men came and shined like a
Black pearl
This time there was no black on black crime
'Cause everybody was thinkin' of ways that pays for
The black mind
One & equal
Not thinkin' of wealth
But knowledge of self
So the past won't repeat like a sequel
Visions of unity
Strong in the community
The same song sung for diplomatic immunity
Is soon to be reality
Not just a formality, an actuality
Built strong by our morality
Can you see what I can see
One force that be lettin' me be what I be
Without costing me members of my family tree
One man can stand for all
But who got his back when he fall
Yo, I had a dream that one day
One million men stood strong and we called it
Black Monday
Black Monday
Black Monday
Black, Black Monday
By now we all know that some wrongs have
Been committed
So be wise, organize my man
Yo, you with it?
Let's have the courage to stand up and speak out
Reach out and help out
No doubt
See we can actually make a difference
The politicians got game, but I say who are
They kiddin'
Seriously, we gotta get our own thing tight
'Cause we ain't even learned
To treat our own peeps right
You don't have to be a scholar to acknowledge
You shouldn't harm your own just 'cause your
Fiendin' for dollars
That's messed up, so fess up
It's good for the soul
Repent
Change your ways
Exhibit more self control
We must be willin' to stop the killin'
'Cause if not
We'll destroy what our forefathers were building
Step up
Do something
It's your duty and purpose
All the material pleasures ultimately are worthless
Curses
They are not needed to explain that
You will wreck your brain
If you do not maintain
Reconciliation, restoration and resolution
Atonement
Completion of perfect union

Branford Marsalis,"Tell you 'bout the future
Of a heart that heals with time...
Still I see in you
Someone I once know
Way back in the past
When my song had words
And the words were meant for you

Tell me when did our future end?
Now I see the truth staring out a window
At love gone astray
Running from herself
Trying to make believe
That it was just a dream
'Cause when love asks of you
More than you can give
You find a way to disappear
Don't you think it's strange
That love could make us strangers?

To be your friend
You ask too much of me
For now I need some time to be
Alone, yes alone
Isn't it strange to love alone
I know 'bout the future
Only time will tell
If you see in me
Someone you once know
A shadow in your life
Before your song had words
And your words will ring true
About love you left in the flames
Well when the smoke clears and I rise
You'll see pain deep in my eyes
But you won't see a tender heart afraid of breaking

The time for tears is yesterday
The time for my life is now
It's time to say
My heart will rise again
I will rise again",Phoenix,1997
Branford Marsalis,"'Tis love which makes the elephant forget
'Tis love which makes the elephant forget
Weary with toil, my soul seeks sweet repose
Yet far from home, no comfort is there to find
My mind at journey's end resumes command
To cast unshadowed doubt (one might suppose)
Our zealous pilgrimage fo sorts unkown
Varied states of enduring discontent
Lead my mind and soul to mortal clatter
Lo thus, my heart ascends the royal throne
And like the thief woh borrows not, but takes
The lover who invokes a jealous rage
With vulgar thoughts spoke venomous in tone
Creates a trembling air, which ultimately quakes
Forgive me not for harboring roguish ways
Not for crude language from a brutal tongue

So guilty am I, myself, love shan't acquit",Weary With Toil,1997

Dearest, the shadows I live with are numberless

Angels have no thought of ever returning you
Would they be angry if I thought of joining you?

Gloomy is Sunday--with shadows I spend it all
My heart and I have decided to end it all
Soon there'll be candles and prayers that are sad I know
Let them not weep; let them know that I'm glad to go
Death is no dream, for in death I'm caressing you
With the last breath of my soul I'll be blessing you

My friends tell me, that I've been such a fool.
But I had to stand by and take it baby, all for lovin' you.

Some people need to watch what they say 

Watch what you're saying 
Someone's gonna hear exactly what you said

While you were laying 
Laying for the doom that's coming to a head

They're sleeping, it's deep man 
So peep in closely when I'm speaking 
Weaklings, it's obvious you can't like up to 
Your petty pointless words, yet and still you love to 
Run off your jibs, now there come a time for judgement 
Punishment, what if we take away your ornaments 
And strip you down to the raw deal 
Then I'd reveal the evidence 
Cause you don't really represent

And bury your ??? like the world it's under 
And like a fool you'll sit and wonder

No water, no magic spell 
Can save you from your self made hell 
You've made your bed and you know darn well 
You got a lay it in the ?
And there's no magic potion

Pull his file, for he knows he cannot hang with this

Dropped a tear where you signed your name,

Smearing the ink into ""Love Always.""

Punching the walls, carrying on like I've gone insane,

And in the mirror,
I can see the man who just shook his head with no remorse,
Watching an angel cry her tears,
Stepping over my beers as you walked out the door.

Crossing the bridge as the sun set on Lake Sinclair.

It was all downhill from there.

If I listen close I can hear battle cries
Of all the heroes come and gone before I was alive
The memories of fourth and three
Now that rival game is coming back to me
It meant more than a big state ring
If we could do it again it'd never be the same
Remember the lights and the butterflies
Giving it all just one last time
Because heroes are remembered but dragons never die

This is ain't no game around here
It's more like religion
We've bet this thing right here
A football tradition
So, everybody get up
And feast your eyes
On the highlight of small town life
It's Friday night

Come on",Friday Night,2009

A Family far from rollin' in the money
7 brothers and sisters to feed and love
Granddaddy said she kept her eyes on the sky,
Watching all the little birds fly
Staring at heaven like her lost home
None of her dreams held fame and fortune
She wanted a husband and children that loved her

Spreading' her wings her feet left ground In Indian
Driving down south just to marry my daddy
Leaving the life she'd known and loved behind
She never cussed or drank, kept on the table
Hell, I kept her on her knees in prayer
She's a God sent blessing wiling and able
As Indiana's angel

Baby back home your daddy's dying
Ã????bout then the kind of perfect timing,
Walked in with liquor on my breath
I sit and watch all of her tears glisten
She said, ""Son you'll learn to listen,
A man stands taller from his knees""
Now I'll never forget how much that hurt
She said, ""Son one day I'll be gone you wont have to hear these words""

Spreading' her wings her feet left ground In Indian
Driving down south just to marry my daddy

Starring you down, every time you show your face

Ah to hell with all the small town small talk I've had enough
It ain't their place to judge

In a truck that daddy bought me
And money mom had saved for school

I laid down all my books and picked up the drinking
Hell I let 'em down
When I gave up like a fool

And one reckless night just lookin' for my whiskey
I found a bible mama gave me and read a while
I read a story 'bout a man who lived just like me
Then finally ate his pride and came runnin' home

And lord I'm a renegade, a rambler
I've squandered all I've owned
A bonified runaway, I'm a gambler
Can't count the lies I've told
And I need redemption, how 'bout forgiveness
And I pray for open arms, and be with me lord
'cause I'm comin' home, like a modern day prodigal son

I had all of my things packed by early mornin'
I left that bottle I'd lost right there on the bathroom floor
I stopped at a payphone and called back home to mama
Yeah she might not even talk after all I've done

The phone rang twice before I got an answer
And mama nearly dropped the phone when she heard me say
I said mama it's your son and will yall have me

Go baby just do your thing,

Walk by the moon-light and down to the river side,
Got you sippin' on the moonshine.

We can settle for a one night rodeo,
If you can be my tan-legged Juliet,
I'll be your redneck romeo

Shooting buckshot at signs,
Drinking beer we just stole,
Passing jugs full of shine,
Leave them girls with one of them boys

Till we all lost our voice,

Catching up on old times turns into hell that we raised,

About the girls we made out with,
And how badass we were,

In the bed of my truck tossing beads and talking shit
Shot gun and beer, playing pong and flip cup,

C’est ma ville la nuit
On rêve de belles sommes
Partout c’est le même sort
Malgré tous ces défauts, c’est ma zone
Et tu seras le bienvenu chez moi
Dans ma ville, la nuit, la haine nous dévore
Mais ça nous rend plus fort
On tue l’ennui dans le shit au sous-sol
Pour oublier ce que nous sommes

Minuit passé, y a que des putes et plus de cendrillon
Investis sur l’album, écoute la délinquance en échantillon
Y a des petits, des grands qui montent dans ce pays où la violence triomphe
Les règlements de compte au vingt-heure en disent long
C’est pour nos secteurs, les environs
Dédié aux coupables innocents en taule, à cause d’une balance qui se trompe
Ici ça trafique shit, coke, exta ou champignons
Parce que plus personne compte sur l’Euromillion
Y a ce côté chaud et froid qui fait qu’on se tue à la vodka et au Dillon
Demande si c’est la merde, mes khos te diront
De la maternité à la morgue, crois pas que le chemin soit aussi long
Mon son, les groupies l’ont, au bec un gros pillon
C’est pour les mecs de zone d’ombre qui traînent en petit nombre
Ca part en couille car le manque de conscience, la folie comble
J’esquive l’ambulance et le commico
Mon flow est au niveau, c’est du processus verbal braco, mino.

REFRAIN

En direct des quartiers difficiles, paroles explicites
Chez nous, même les culs de jatte font des délits de fuite
Des mecs se font canner, et c’est trop tard pour composer le dix-huit
Ici, y a que des princes de la récidive
Tout le monde regrette les années collège
Les collègues ont le choix entre l’abonnement de l’O.M. et celui des Baumettes
Plus on avance et plus on se dit que l’espoir est dead
C’est pas parce que l’accent est joli que l’histoire est belle
Avant de vouloir soulever des montagnes 
Je commence par savoir changer ma roue quand y a mon pneu qui crève sur un dos d’âne
Un-Trois, bitume matricule
Prises de sueur froide, les vielles ont peur de moi comme d’une canicule
On squatte sous l’abri-bus avec toute la tribu
C’est l’étiquette des voitures qui brûlent, qu’on nous attribue
Elle est moins belle la vie de la Côte d’Azur
Ne te fies pas aux cartes postales
L’odeur de la pisse, nous on l’assume

REFRAIN

Les bruits et les sirènes retentissent
Devant une belle, pour du sexe, les bandits s’attendrissent
Ca vole, ça mendie. On traîne tard en ville.
Esquive les flics pour voir notre argent sale blanchi pendant qu’en taule ça se branle et ça cantine
Représente les coins pas tranquilles
Sur la trajectoire de la balle que Satan tire
Passe la bouteille que je l’enquille
Tout va bien, je me jetterai pas dans le vide
Ce soir, c’est les hyènes face aux chiennes de Sarkozy
Tu veux sortir en boîte, en poche, y a pas un centime
Quand c’est la merde, faut apprendre à pas la sentir
Comme l’on très bien dit certains, dehors ça glisse donc gare à ton fils
Ou sois garanti qu’il atteindra pas trente piges

Ce voyou fait grise mine et n’a pas le temps de fuir

Lucifer, Belzebuth ou Azazel, passent à l’acte,
Pendant qu’la faucheuse nous guette et prépare sa lame,
Dans nos galères, c’est pas facile d’être un sain,
Le mal veut nous baiser jusqu’à nous mettre enceinte,
La rue, c’est l’envers des anges, c’est rude pour ceux qui plongent en cellule, 
Et ceux qui braquent avec des fausses perruques,
L’innocent matraqué par la PJ,
Un système d’handicapé qui t’rends paraplégique, (oooh)
Mon Dieu, si t’es là, fais nous signe,
Y’a trop de terroristes qui planent déguisés en muslim,
Cet homme qui investit dans sa bombe,
Pour quelques millions qui n’iront pas dans sa tombe,
C’est triste à dire, chez moi le crack pousse comme des orchidées,
Gwada et ses caïds qu’on retrouve les corps criblés,
Mélange pas le banditisme et ma rime dancehall,
Incompatible comme le Christ et « Marilyn Manson »,

J’vois le Mal c’est un truc de ouf,
Dans l’argot de « Sarko », dans la bouche de « Bush »,
Dans les gênes de « Le Pen », dans ce shit qui m’bouffe,
Dans les glocks, dans le bloc qui t’enfonce dans l’gouffre,
Jusqu’à c’que t’étouffe,
Ça va trop vite, mes négros sont de-spee,
On a un pied entre le bon et le mauvais esprit,
Sexe, drogue et violence, c’est pour ça que je chante le Mal,
J’vois qu’les pédophiles se font passer pour des gentlemans,
Frelo, ça devient culte, 
J’peux tuer pour mon peuple,
J’pourrais tuer pour un but,
Mais pas pour une pute,
C’est la misère et l’apparence qui tiennent les rennes,
Si t’as pas l’argent sale, t’as pas la femme de tes rêves,
Le Sheitan, agit sur nos faiblesses,
Les camés de ma tess’ se prennent pour « Fedex »,
Ah ouais ! C’est l’diable qui l’emporte au Paradis,
Il vit à nos dépens, se nourrit comme un parasite,

Mon parcours est risqué donc j’me fie à l’instinct
Fils de musicien, j’peux pas fuir mon destin
Ma vie de chien a voulu me piéger pleins de fois
J’canalise cette amertume dans mon grain de voix
Mon but c’est de finir ce que mon père a commencé dans la zik
Pour sauver l’honneur, j’suis prêt à plonger dans l’acide
Parce que mon rap a pris racines dans ce désert aride
Mais où se cachent les poids lourds ? Le bulldozer arrive
J’ai dosé mes rimes, posé les mines, 
Explose les ennemis qui me causent des ennuis
Ils savent pas ce que j’endure, ce que j’ai parcouru
Là d’où je viens, si tu flambes trop tu repars tout nu
J’me suis fait respecté, la rue m’a vite marqué
D’une vie d’raté, corrompu à la Vic Mackey
Il en faut plus pour me nuire, j’vais pas vous le dire en six langues

Un mollusque devenu robuste
Ça a pas été facile de sortir du blocus
J’écris ce que je vis, c’est pas du Balzac
J’gratte mes textes crus avec du sang de spartiate
J’ai voulu faire autre chose histoire de me racheter
Mais mes pêchés coûtaient trop cher, ça n’a pas marché
Le monde du travail m’a pris pour un idiot
Mais j’prenais sur moi, fallait bien remplir le frigo
J’ai bicrav aux toxicos, dépouiller les bourgeois
Le chômage m’angoissait, j’ai pas eu beaucoup de choix
C’que j’ai kiffé de ma vie de rue
C’est la haine qui s’est déclenchée dans ma sique-mu
Le reste superflu, le biz, les magouilles, les tasses-pé

Excité comme la gaule d’un gorille
J’ai envie de tout péter comme une bombe à bord d’un Boeing
Timal, chercher à me ralentir c’est chercher à m’abattre
Interdit aux boulets voulant s’accrocher à ma patte
J’connais ta blague, petit, tu parles de street
Mais tu sors jamais de chez toi, ta mère te tient par le slip
J’ai appris à être rapide
Surtout quand il s’agit faire du liquide pendant que les kisdés rappliquent
J’ai pas envie de faire le chaud, ni de prendre des airs mafieux
Même si j’aime les films de gangster et les armes à feu
Mais j’peux pas me fier au système, entouré de vautours
Des pantins qu’on manipule avec des poupées Voodoo
Moi, j’veux juste mettre ma mif à l’abri

Brass Monkey,"I am a brisk lad and my fortune is bad,
And if e'er I get rich it's a wonder,
I've spent all my money on girls and strong beer,
What riches I had are all plundered.
Field after field off to market I sent,
Till the land was all gone and the money was spent,
My heart was so hard that I never did repent,
And that's what put me into Limbo.

Oh once I could run while the others did lie,
Strut like a crow in the gutter,
The people all said that saw me passing by,
There goes Mr. Fop in a flutter;
To the top and top-gallant I hoisted my sails,
With a flimsy cravat and a wig with three tails,
Oh, now I am ready to gnaw my own nails,
Drink the cold water of Limbo.

Oh I had an Uncle, he lived in the West,
And he heard of my sad disaster,
Poor soul! After that he could never take rest,
Oh, his sorrows came faster and faster;
He came to the gaol to see my sad case,
And as soon as I saw him I knew his old face,
And I stood gazing at him like one in disgrace,
And I wished myself safe out of Limbo.

Jack, if I should set you once more on your legs,
And put you in credit and fashion,
Oh! will you lay off all those rakish old ways,
Try for to govern your passion?
Oh Uncle, says I, if you will set me free,
I surely will always be ruled by thee,
And I'll labour my bones for the good of my soul,
See myself miles out of Limbo.

Then out of his purse he pulled three thousand pounds,
He counted it up in bright guineas,
And when I was free of those prison's gates,
Oh, I went to see Peggy and Jeannie;
In my old ragged clothes they knew nought of my gold,
And they all turned me out in the wet and the cold,
You'd a-laughed for to hear how those hussies did scold,
The night they let me out of Limbo.",Limbo,2004

Brass Tracks Jazz Orchestra,"A country dance was being held in a garden
I felt a bump and heard an ""Oh, beg your pardon""
Suddenly I saw polka dots and moonbeams
All around a pug-nosed dream

I held my breath and said ""May I have the next one?""
In my frightened arms, polka dots and moonbeams
Sparkled on a pug-nosed dream

Brassknuckle Boys,"Well I woke up Sunday morning
With no way to hold my head
That didn't hurt
And the beer I had for breakfast wasn't
Bad so I had one more for dessert

Then I fumbled through my closet
For my clothes
And found my cleanest dirty shirt
And I shaved my face
And combed my hair
And stumbled down the stairs
To meet the day

I'd smoked my brain the night before
With cigarettes and songs
That I've been pickin'
But I lit my first and watched a small kid
Cussin' at a can that he was kickin

Then I crossed the empty street and
Caught the sunday smell
Of someone fryin chicken
And it took me back to something
That I'd lost somehow
Somewhere along the way

On the sunday morning sidewalk
Wishing lord that I was stoned
Cause there's something in a sunday
That makes a body feel alone
And there's nothing short of dying
Half as lonesome as the sound
On the sleeping city sidewalk
Sunday morning coming down

In the park I saw a daddy
With a laughing little girl
He was swingin
And I stopped beside the Sunday school
And listened to the song
That they were singing

Then I headed back for home
And somewhere far away
A lonely bell was ringing
And it echoed thru the canyon like
The disappearing dreams of yesterday

On the sunday morning sidewalk
Wishing lord that I was stoned
Cause therels something in a sunday
That makes a body feel alone
And there's nothing short of dying
Half as lonesome as the sound
On the sleeping city sidewalk

? rappers are full of this, since I'm a Don I'm pulling out a hit
'cause I'm fired up, I'm tired of all the bullshit
Flavor Unit, it's time to attack the prey
So make way for hip-hop's green beret
Bring on the refills, you see we feel
The name of the brain game is kill or be killed
I'm an expert, who will be the next jerk to try?
Let me explain you got 8 million ways to die
We torch and scorch ya, make ya feel real sore
Have that ass looking just like this boo-boo slipped the door
Known to kill, dunk skills, e-rupt
You ask why? My reply is 'I don't give a fuck!'
I'm a Panther, I love fresh meat
After I kill ya, I'ma leave ya body across 110th Street
My tactics are drastic and real fast
I tie one to a truck and go drag ya ass
I'm more than a threat, I'm a problem
To hell with cotton, watch out when I come to Harlem
So don't whisper or make a sound or croak
Shit ya prop, go straight back down ya throat

You're next of kin, friend, follow the flow format
While you slip, I grips so expect to get bruised
Ask me if I give a fuck 'cause I ain't got shit to lose
Fuck around, lay around and get stuck up
You beatnit, wait a minute, hold the fuck up
If I was deaf, dumb, blind, stupid, blame
Handicapped, crippled and ""pussy"" was my middle name
You couldn't beat me slick, snap that neck like a Chico stick
I know who beat'cha quick (who?), my grip
Failing this to some type of tournament
I cut ya fucking head off and use it as a Christmas tree ornament
Come and give me a test whoever claims to be the best
He's with the 40-below footprint on his chest
Fucked up, got stuck, go press your luck
Both of his legs were found in back of a garbage truck
Head found in the bar of a limousine
The rest of his body at a dove site in Queens
Damn man, Mr. Handman, you like bragging
Ya fucked up, made a wrong turn and entered the dragon
I told you I'm out to stalk,

Give me a hearing aid or two then I'm through 'cause I'm that def
That's how we all be, tighter than small leaves

Tape them and cruise me then, if I'm wrong, sue me then
Wait let me hear another tune, tune me in
So I'm straight, if I hear ""drop the bomb"" I have to go
Break this nig' for anytime or any day, as many rhymes are played
Erase, forgive me not 'cause shit I'm hot, if I can get then you'll get got
Au contraire mon frere this is all my hair
I wouldn't cut it for the biggest butt-ocks out there
Put on a tip or hitting hips, I'm more than quick

Qui a fait déborder l'orage
De la grisaille des nuages
Donnant quarante jours de pluie

Si je tenais la goutte d'eau

Une oasis unique au monde
Pour que la force lui soit en vie

Et en vertu de ce cadeau
J'inviterais Dieu à ma table
Ainsi que la rose des sables
A partager cette eau de vie

Je désaltérerais la chance

D'une existence difficile
Entre les fils et le reptile
Où l'abondance est hors la loi

Pour récolter la providence
Et l'espoir de sauver ma peau

Car j'ai peur que le manque d'eau
Aggrave encore l'insupportable
Puisque la soif est indomptable
Et la pénurie un fléau

So consumed, you know your doom
Tryin' hard to fill the emptiness, the peace is gone
Let the puzzle undone and that's the way it is

It's showing who you really are

Express yourself this way now
The way you know you should
You always seem to know how
To make it look so good

You've got it
Something like no one else, you can tell
That you've got it
The way that you sparkle, the way that you shine

You've got it
You're individual, you can tell
That you've got it
And you make it look so good, so right

Brav,"Évidement, toute cette histoire n'est qu'une fiction
Qui j'espère invitera à la réflexion
Sur les dérives, parfois sectaires d'un isolement social, racial ou économique
Combattre les extrêmes, avant que ce soit l'inverse

Déjà petit, très peu d'amis, souvent solitaire
Unique enfant d'une famille discrète, ouvrière
Qui pour survivre dans ce milieu de bâtiments précaires
Gratte jour et nuit, touche le SMIC pour un taf' de merde
Dure est la vie, mais bon tant pis, il faudra faire avec
T'façon ici, on a beau crier, nul n'entend l'appel
Alors enlisé dans l'oubli, on tente de rester fier
Mais la sère-mi fini très vite par faire baisser la tête
Dix-neuf-cent-quatre-vingt-six, j'avais cinq piges à peine
J'ai vu arriver sans un bruit la douleur quotidienne
D'une mère infirme que les soucis ont quasi rendu muette
D'un daron qui dans le Whisky tente de noyer les dettes
Et qui se venge de ses défaites en détruisant c'qu'il aime
En tabassant souvent ma mère quand ce n'est pas moi-même
Chaque jour plus rude et plus obscur que celui de la veille
Me pousse à traîner dans la rue, fuir cette sale rengaine
À sept-huit piges, passage difficile par l'école primaire
Où j'ai rapidement appris le sens du mot ""colère""
Faut dire qu'entendre sans arrêt des ""Vas-y, nique ta mère""
Marque l'esprit qui encore aujourd'hui me reste en travers
Je me souviens qu'à cette époque, j'aurais souhaiter que crèvent
Tous ces connards de fils de bourges qui m'insultaient sans cesse
De sale pauvre, de cassos, de bâtard parfois même
Finalement cette période forge mon caractère
Un peu plus tard, c'est au lycée que tout s'accélère
Un jour de Mars, pour un regard pourtant ordinaire
Une bande de rabzas et de blacks à la réput' vénère
S'y mettent à quatre pour me coincer dans les chiottes, et merde
Tout va très vite, l'un d'eux me gifle tandis qu'les autres me tiennent
J'essaye de fuir mais tous ces types sur mon corps se jettent
Les coups déferlent et les insultes sur ma gueule s'enchaînent
Aucune issue, et si je suis seul contre quatre, que faire?
Répondre j'aimerais, mais maintenu de force à terre
Une main sur la bouche m'empêche de donner l'alerte
Lorsque soudain, l'un d'eux se lève, prend son élan, abrège
D'un penalty dans les gencives, c'est le trou noir direct

Inconscient, c'est dans mon sang dans lequel je baigne
Qu'on me retrouve quelques instants après ce long calvaire
Transporté aux urgences dans un profond sommeil
C'est seulement trois jours plus tard que je me réveille
Les jambes cassées, les côtes pétées ainsi qu'une trentaine
De points de sutures sur le crâne et l'arcade sourcilière
Sous assistance respiratoire, fracture de l'abdomen
Je m'alimente et n'chie que par des tuyaux désormais
Les journées passent ainsi de suite, ça fait déjà six semaines
Que je suis cloué sur ce lit d'hôpital sans rien faire
À l'exception de quelques visites, trois ou quatre lettres
Je passe le plus clair de mon temps à ruminer ma haine
À ressasser silencieusement chaque minute de cette scène
À contenir douloureusement ma colère et ma peine
Moi qui n'avais jamais rien fait, pourquoi est-ce moi, bordel ?
Pourquoi ceci, pourquoi cela, pourquoi, pourquoi, merde!
Il est certain qu'aujourd'hui j'suis plus tout à fait le même
J'ai juste envie d'acheter une arme et de flinguer ces mecs
Ainsi même que tous leurs semblables, indigènes
Quand les parasites envahissent, l'extrême droite est l'remède
Ils feraient mieux d'rentrer chez eux, d'retourner dans leur bled
Au lieu de profiter des alloc', salir ma France si belle

Brav,"Dans la famille Bravoure, j'aurais voulu le père
Celui qui ne connaît pas le sien puisqu'il s'est fait la belle
Fils unique au parcours singulièrement complexe
La discipline des hommes d'Église a fait de lui un croyant plus que perplexe
Limite anarchiste solitaire, préfère perdre le combat que de faire marche arrière
Mauvaise pioche, la suite n'ira que de mal en pire
Pour s'en sortir, il sera forcé de prendre la mer à tout juste 14 piges
Un apprentissage qui enseigne
Que le comble des marins c'est se noyer dans un verre de Clan Campbell
Si il y a des raisons d'être caractériel, 
Je comprends mieux d'où me vient cette colère éternelle

Je me fous bien où la route me mène
Je veux savoir d'où je suis parti

Dans la famille Bravoure, j'voudrais la grande sœur
Elle qui a vu sa mère se battre pour de grandes œuvres
Elle qui aurait pu saisir sa chance
Mais elle a tendance à croire que c'est un combat perdu d'avance
Elle sait qu'le monde est plus beau quand on s'aime
Elle est passé de la crise d'ado à celle de la quarantaine
S'il y a des raisons d'affronter la vie de manière si peu sereine
J'comprends d'où vient cette impression d'être seule face à moi-même

Je me fous bien où la route me mène
Je veux savoir d'où je suis parti

Dans la famille Bravoure, j'aurais voulu l'aîné des fils
Génération U2, Bob Marley, Police
Stéréotype machiste qui s'la joue relou à tout va
Sauf que derrière chaque grande gueule se cache un opposé qui n'ose pas
Atteint, par le syndrome du rejet
Faire du mal aux autres avant que ce soit l'inverse semble le rassurer
Si il y a des raisons d'être aussi cruel, 
J'comprends mieux d'où m'vient cette méchanceté habituelle

Je me fous bien où la route me mène
Je veux savoir d'où je suis parti

Dans la famille Bravoure, j'aurais voulu le second garçon
Orgueilleux sans fond, insociable avec mention pense du mal de tout le monde
Jusqu'à preuve du contraire, s'il te sourit
Méfie-toi, c'est surement en pensant au coup qu'il peut te faire
Obscure, un pléonasme
Y a plus d'amour c'est sur dans une lettre de menace
S'il y a des raisons d'être aussi odieux, 
J'comprends mieux d'où vient cette part de moi si ténébreuse

Je me fous bien où la route me mène
Je veux savoir d'où je suis parti

Dans la famille Bravoure, j'aurais voulu le dernier né
Que l'on surprotège de peur qu'il prenne les mêmes voies de merde que ses aînés
Autant d'effort qui laisseront des traces
Car c'est en recouvrant le feu qu'il s'éteint hélas
Coincé dans son Truman Show
Le monde vu de sa bulle est à des kilomètres du nôtre
Si il y a des raisons d'être aussi lunaire, 
J'comprends mieux d'où me vient cette envie de quitter cette terre

Je me fous bien où la route me mène
Je veux savoir d'où je suis parti

Dans la famille Bravoure, j'voudrais la mère
Elle qui a créé ses propres règles pour qu'on ne puisse pas jouer avec ses rêves
Elle a le cœur sur la main, la main sur le cœur
Doyenne d'une fratrie de 11 frères et sœurs
Elle connaît le partage mais peu l'importe qui
Si elle avait la clé du bonheur, elle t'aurait fait un double pour ton porte-clé
Dans ce monde où personne ne s'fait de cadeaux, où tout le monde veut l'fric
Elle pourrait construire un château avec une seule brique
Là où les paroles s'envolent comme des ballons d'baudruche
Elle a rejoint les bénévoles de la cantine de Coluche
Si y a des raisons de donner autant sans recevoir
J'comprends mieux d'où vient cette partie si généreuse en moi

J'suis tous les mois rappeur du mois, pourtant j'suis plus là
Indépendant hors des tendances, j'fais les singles avec des cendres
Si les plus forts se servent de foies, les plus faibles servent d'offrande
Ma liberté loin d'être à vendre
Si les derniers seront les premiers pourquoi devrais-je attendre?
Le refus est clair et net ose retirer le pain de ma bouche

Ce n'est pas moi qui est violent mais la vision de la réalité
Toucher c'n'est pas couler, j'étouffais donc j'ai tout fait

Y a pas de pire ennemi dans ce monde que ceux dont on est proche
J'veux juste apprendre à remplir le cœur avec le vide qu'j'ai dans les poches

Parfois j'fais du bien, je crois, mais j'crois du mal bien plus souvent
L'avenir n'appartient pas à ceux qui vont s'lever tôt, mais à ceux qui ont le véto, boy

Espérer un jour te voir
Au lieu d'm'arracher les cheveux
J'devrais plutôt t'raser de ma mémoire
Mais rien à faire, chaque fois que j'essaye de t'oublier, j'échoue

Tout chez toi me fascine

Empêcher le chien d'aboyer pour l'os que je lui donne
Faire taire les pianos, et sans roulements de tambours
Sortir le cercueil avant la fin du jour
Que les avions qui hurlent au dehors
Dessinent dans le ciel ces trois mots : ""Il Est Mort""
Nouer des voiles noirs aux colonnes des édifices
Gantez de noir les mains des agents de police
Que les étoiles se retirent, qu'on les balaye
Démonter la lune et le soleil
Vider l'océan, arracher la forêt

J'voulais que tout soit clair
Avant que le couvercle ne se referme
Une dernière fois, emmerder les bourgeois, les ministères
Cracher la vérité amère, de la part de la classe ouvrière

Faire que ça change, était le but, c'est c'que j'ai cru
Je suis venu, j'ai vu, j'ai fait ce que j'ai pu, je te le jure
J'ai été jusqu'à parler de moi
Moi qui d'ordinaire préfère se taire
Éviter le sujet comme un ennemi devant sa mère
J'ai essayé d'être juste, peu importe qui ils croient
J'ai essuyé des insultes, et mes yeux quelques fois
Quel qu'en soit le prix à payer, j'paierai
J'préfère mille fois crever debout que vivre à genoux, c'est vrai
J'ai dû ravaler ma fierté, aux sorties de vieux démons
En faisant semblant de sourire pour ressembler à tout l'monde
J'ai même mis d'côté la honte, pris sur moi souvent
Afin de mettre des mots sur mes dégoûts, mes tourments
Mis à poil en parlant d'moi, un peu il fallait qu'ils le sachent
Ce qui se cache derrière le masque, mon côté face ténébreux
Un côté sage qui n'est que de la mascarade débile
Parce que, comme Anakin, j'ai la colère facile
Je suis pire que c'qu'ils imaginent, oui l'obscurité me fascine
Bipolaire: mon profil, mon passé: mon talon d'Achille
J'espérais faire de la musique un moyen d'nous libérer
Que ma lutte soit autre chose qu'une défaite anticipée
Anti-injustice, anti-inégalités, j'ai eu beau semer d'la paix
J'n'ai récolté que des procès, j'ai donné tout c'que j'pouvais
D'la sueur, du sang et des larmes, j'y ai laissé des années
Des amis, délaissé même ma femme, pour finalement quoi?
La richesse? La gloire? Non même pas, chez moi
C'est toujours aussi difficile les trente derniers jours du mois
J'étouffais, alors j'ai tout fait, dis merci, s'il vous plaît
Mais toujours rien à bouffer
Échouer ou réussir, au fond n'a pas d'importance
Plus l'combat est grand, plus la victoire est immense
Certains me disent que je prends des risques
Mais qui le fera si j'me défile?
Je me sens vivre que si, utile à mes semblables, je le suis
Je me fiche bien qu'ils en rient, j'écris pas je résiste
Ni profit, ni bénéfice, j'suis qu'un bénévole lyriciste
Moi, pour que je cède, faudrait qu'je trépasse
Plante-moi dans le dos, si tu trouves encore de la place
Sous une bâche sont mes chances d'être suivi, c'est certain
En France c'est sûr qu'y'a moins de Jean Moulin que de Pétain
Et puisque rien ne nous attend à part le Père Lachaise
J'écris chacun de mes textes façon dimanche à l'irlandaise
Si j'frappe sans raison, l'histoire m'en donnera elle
Aussi loin que je m'en rappelle
Être libre, c'est choisir soi-même ses chaînes
Qu'un seul tienne et les autres suivront
Ou est-ce l'inverse? J'ai bien l'impression
On m'a dit ""L'union fait la force"" mais qui fera l'union?
Dans c'pays où les moutons se comptent par millions
Où la morale et la raison ont déserté les lieux
Où les riches sont plus riches, et les pauvres plus nombreux
Je n'peux rien prendre, je vous laisse tout
T'inquiète : un jour, la roulette russe tourne
Qu'ils se rassurent: j'n'ai pas fini d'me battre
J'n'étais pas rappeur, mais un révolté qui fait du rap
J'ai tenté d'être brave, j’espère ne pas m'être pas trop perdu des fois
Désolé si j'déçois, mais parfois, j'ai du faire des choix
Mauvais ou bons, ça: no comment
Indifférent, je sais bien trop d'choses pour l'être
Y'a eu Renaud avant moi, y'a eu Dylan avant lui
Après moi, qui viendra ? Après moi, c'n'est pas fini
Enfin j'espère, car vu le QI d'fruits d'mer de ces pseudo-leaders
J'ai des envies de Columbine toutes les demi-heures
Dis-leur, que l'abandon et moi font deux
Si l'futur est flou, c'est parce qu'on est au pied du mur
Bien sûr, je n'souris pas je grogne, ne me caresse pas je mords
Tout est de la faute de Tyler Durden
C'est p't-être la dernière fois qu'on m'entend, autant être franc
Je n'suis pas de ceux qui suivent, je préfère prendre de l'avance
Gardez vos distances, je garderai mon calme
Baisse d'un ton, et je baisserai mon arme
Je crois que tout est dit, ou presque
Je laisse, le silence faire le reste
P.S. parmi les pauvres, enterrez-moi sans roses
En espérant qu'il pleuve
Qu'on pleure au moins pour quelque chose
Comme toujours
Les plus faibles servent de proies, rien ne m'étonne
Résignés, les autres ferment les yeux, sont borgnes
Pourquoi pour rêver, faut-il attendre que l'on dorme?
Les portes closes, j'avance avec une clé de sol
Toujours les plus faibles servent de proies, rien ne m'étonne

Brav,"Le jour se lève à peine sur ma planète Sous France
Rien de neuf aux nouvelles, ici tout baigne dans un bain d'sang
Y'a ceux qui se sentent mal aimé, ceux qui aiment ce mal qui les enfante
J'voulais te dessiner un sourire, je n'ai su écrire que le mot Sous France
Quelques lettres à peine qui cachent une peine bien plus profonde
Celle des visages sans nom à la voix grave à cause des blondes
Qui n'auront de vue sur le monde que d'une télévision Revolving
Dans un paradis en location, d'un HLM seventies
Où le vice et la vertu de celui qui souhaite y faire affaire
Avec l’alcool, les drogues en guise de friandises pas chère
Les filières clandestines voient défiler des familles entières
Et tant pis si les gosses peuvent mourir, ça fera plus vite fleurir les cimetières
Rien à cirer d'leurs origines, d'leurs religions, etc
On veut seulement qu'ils tapinent sans oublier d'payer la TVA
Quel luxe d'avoir vue sur la merde du haut d'ton balcon de té-ci
Arrête de parler de course aux richesses, t'es pas foutu d'te lever avant midi
Entre ascenseur pissotière et seringues de toxico
Les préservatifs usagés, la gerbe de teenagers alcoolos
On parle comme des pseudo gangsters sous nos grands airs de gigolos
On n'sait qu'ramener les keufs à nos mères, il est beau le cartel de Mexico
Et à part cramer les bagnoles d’autres ouvriers bien plus modestes
On se paie en carte Accord des signes extérieurs de richesse
Si gamins on jouait les durs, adultes c'est sur on joue les cons
Tous ces sourires de contrefaçon cachent des passe-temps sans passion
Où nos seuls moments d'évasion s'arrêtent aux portes des bars-tabac
Pendant qu'on libéralise des pensées, ils privatisent des emplois
Ils t'annonceront la retraite en même temps qu'un cancer généralisé
Je crois que plus on devient des hommes plus on perd notre humanité
Y'a qu'à regarder ce qu'on a fait de nos soi-disantes révolutions
Des sous-produits marketing d'un mode de vie devenu obsession
C'est tout ce que nous sommes et tout ce que nous laisserons
Des égocentriques par orgueil, égo-centrés, égos sans fond
Même nos connasses de bonnes femmes finissent par s'tirer un beau jour
Quand elles comprennent qu'on peut s'payer enfin par CB de l'amour
Des bébés éprouvettes d'un millier d'géniteurs anonymes
De nouveaux nichons à cinquante berges pour faire comme les filles des magasines
Voilà pourquoi l'lion marche seul et qu'les moutons restent en troupeau
Est-ce logique que même entouré j'ai l'sentiment d'être solo
Il faudrait probablement faire quelques efforts d'intégration
On sait jamais, j'pourrais trouver l'amour au cœur d'ce viol en réunion
Les saisons passent, tout reste de glace devant leurs JT d'plus en plus noirs
A force d'être gavés comme des oies, on va pouvoir faire du foie d'connards
L'hiver recouvre d'un manteau blanc, le corps des SDF qui en ont pas
La prochaine canicule fera le ménage aux réunions du troisième age
Et comme si ça n'suffisait pas, on s'cherche des couilles sur la toile
On s'fout à poil pour quelques j'aime, on s'fout en l'air pour moins qu'ça
Et merde je crois bien que c'est dead, ils ont mis bas nos idéaux
Peut-être qu'leurs théories du complot ce n'est rien d'autre qu'un autre complot
La vie a démarré par des larmes, s'terminera par celles de nos proches
Si notre histoire laisse des traces, ce sera surement sur la gorge
Pour s'faire du mal non t'inquiète pas, y'a toujours eu de bons prétextes

Ni siquiera a visitarme;
Nadie quiere consolarme
En mi aflicción;
Desde el día que te fuiste
Siento angustias en mi pecho;
Dec? percanta, qu? has hecho
De mi pobre corazón!

Sin embargo
Yo siempre te recuerdo
Con el cariño santo
Que tuve para ti;
Why estás dentro de mi alma,
Pedazo de mi vida,
En la ilusión querida
Que nunca olvidar?

Al cotorro abandonado
Ya ni el sol de la mañana
Asoma por la ventana,
Como cuando estabas vos...
Why aquel perrito compañero
Que por tu ausencia no comía
Al verme solo, el otro día,
También me dej?

For I found you, the love of my life,
In somebody else's arms
Your eyes are echoing ""perfidia,""
Forgetful of our promise of love,
You're sharing another's charms
With a sad lament, my dreams
Have faded like a broken melody;
While the gods of love look down and laugh
At what romantic fools we mortals be
And now I know my love was not for you
And so I'll take it back with a sigh,
Perfidious one, good-bye.

That it was my fault that I lost your love

To the love that once knew me
I am looking with great urgencies
Before I will be lost in what you said.

Our shadows taller than our souls
There walks a lady we all know

How everything still turns to gold

The tune will come to you at last

To be a rock and not to roll

Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie

And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms

To coordinate your steps and clap
Avoid the individuality trap
Take a walk on the wild side

A wet day, which everyone you choose

Brave Saint Saturn,"A Friday night affair 
Out in the city heat 
Always a party there 
Along the sordid street 
And it was guaranteed 
The place to be was Rocketown 

The drinks were two for one 
Inside the crowded bars 
The girls would make their run 
Down on the boulevard 
It was the idol place 
We lived the ways of Rocketown 
Hang around by the street light 
In the heart of the night life 

There came a certain man 
A stranger to the crowd 
We didn't understand 
What he was all about 
He walked a different pace 
So out of place in Rocketown 

They made a fool of him 
They teased him when he's speak 
But when they knocked him down 
He turned the other cheek 
He told me I could find 
A life outside of Rocketown 
Hang around by the street light 
In the heart of the night life 

Chorus:
What was his mission 
Where was he going 
Why was his heart light always glowing? 
All I was missing 
He stood there holding 
What was his secret 
Could I know it? 

Some didn't like him near 
Some laughed and turned away 
But me, I longed to hear 
All that he had to say 
He had a peace of mind 
I couldn't find in Rocketown 
And when I reached down inside me 
I could feel the emptiness 

He said it's in the heart 
This change that comes to be 
Now he had done his part 
The rest was up to me 
As we were standing there 
He said a prayer for Rocketown 
As we were standing there 
He said a prayer for Rocketown 

He walked off silently 
And prayed for me 
And Rocketown...",Rocketown,2000

And I wished it all away 
I felt so alone, yeah

Crawling on a tightrope 
The bravest thing I have is hope 

Daylight, save me 
Daylight, save me

Incandescent burning lies 
And the silence stands for nothing 
Desperate I search the skies

You never did forget me 
And when I bled in darkness, You held me 
Still held me 
When desperate nights I cursed You 
You loved me, still loved me

You break my heart of stone

Only You can save me

Brave the Pain,"This is me

We are young, heartache to heartache we stand
No promises, no demands love is a battlefield
Woah, we are strong, no one can tell us we're wrong
Searching our hearts for so long, both of us knowing
Love is a battlefield

You're making me to go, you're begging me stay
Why do you hurt me so bad?
It would help me to know
Do I stand in your way, or am I the best thing you've had?
Believe me, believe me, I can't tell you why
But I'm trapped by your love, and I'm chained to your side

We are young, heartache to heartache we stand
No promises, no demands love is a battlefield
We are strong, no one can tell us we're wrong
Searching our hearts for so long, both of us knowing
Love is a battlefield

And if I'm losing control will you turn me away or touch me deep inside?
And before this gets old, will it still feel the same?
There's no way this could die
But if we get much closer, I could lose control
And if your heart surrenders, you'll need me to hold

We are young, heartache to heartache we stand
No promises, no demands love is a battlefield
We are strong, no one can tell us we're wrong
Searching our hearts for so long, both of us knowing
Love is a battlefield

We are young, heartache to heartache we stand
No promises, no demands love is a battlefield
We are strong, no one can tell us we're wrong
Searching our hearts for so long, both of us knowing
Love is a battlefield

Braveheart's,"Where my real niggas at
there's a lot of real niggas out there
there's a lot of real niggas everywhere
that's why you don't fuck with just anybody
A lot of niggas is just on the low, chilling
Not bothering nobody, until one motherfucker fuck with em
And then all hell break loose

[Chorus: x2]
Quiet niggas will kill
Loud niggas talk shit
Them be the ones that get killed
It's wild where we walk kid
Is you brave nigga
Is you a slave nigga
Is you a made nigga
Or is you a paid nigga

Well known gangstas, in trust
That we bust
Your heart and soul lies with us
Boldly go where we once took a nigga before
Now the motherfucker begging for more
Its the reason
Standing here shaking, hating the haters
They watching my paper
Realize, a 4 5 will open his eyes
Now what the fuck you think he saw before he drop
Nigga standin there just like a cop
Braveheart I'm screaming up the block
Now the soldier, cadet, general in fact
Don't let me get up and show yawl motherfucker's respect
Plans connect
The twinkle and diamonds upon my neck
More jazz than Hornecek
I blast and leave your corner wet
Straight on top of ya
Spitting like the trench coat mafia
In a school yard we make it hard
Was popping yawl
We made our change was stopping yawl
They spray your names rest in peace on the ? wall

[Chorus: x2]

I wave gang signs at the youth, that's down for the cause
Cling them things in the ? you better get yours
Time is running out
Your streets is getting smaller as we speak
Juliani turns these lights on so niggas can't creep
I miss the shit of days we did this
Please free John Gotti
They kept the black man eating, not killing everybody
Drug wars is real
You have no friends in the outfield
Foul balls is deaf, umpires keep ice grilles
there's no tomorrow its the bottom of the 9 9
Can't die a broke man with a bitch that's fine
My hearts full of braveness so who the fuck will want to save this
Fallen angel from fallen star and chaos on this nation
Don't play us on your station if you pussy or you hating
You can find us in the hood; thugging and regulating
Don't play us on your station if you pussy or you hating
You can find us in the hood; thugging and regulating

[Chorus: x2]

We here to eat food, my peoples, be lethal
Shots in your body make you see through
Quiet niggas become jail riot niggas
25 to life, big never cry niggas
Floss when they up north
Chest getting bigger
Celebs on the V I respect that nigga
Rege on the regular chops is up, like a editor
Come through on man gang like the predator
If yawl wake I'll wet it up
Jungle set it up
The jackal rock you to sleep while I'm coming at you
Air out your area, Queens Bridge forever, what
Ill will the label
Bravehearts yawl scared of us

Yo when those niggas ran these niggas stayed
With these niggas switched up and bitched up afraid
These niggas clicked up and ripped up the gauge
Those niggas got jail and sick cause we paid
Don't even rep Q be	
You ain't got hood stripes
Looters come through catch you fronting
And its good night
Know how much force this is
Juggle horse and whiz
Nothing but horses kid
We go to war for this

Bitches call me Horse the pussy filler
I'll fuck a big boned or slim chick
Beat that pussy up real quick then send home the bitch
Ain't no sleepin' in my bedroom
When henny's in my dick
When Flex drop the bomb I bust a nut on this bitch
Deep throat, Caesar gold or pun wicked hoes
Who like the way I thug and the way I flow
I like head in the Benz, the four door or the Coupe
Head in the staircase, the cellar or the roof
Head in the studio, the bathroom or the booth
Head from a project chick or one with crazy loot
Like Nia Long in a cherry thong with the lights on

Keep it, dead serious

No need for the gun play, it's ok, 'cause you dyin' anyway

Sellin' crack, sellin' smack
You thuggin' it, you ain't turn it back

Gettin' high with my enemy's girlfriend

For my seeds I even let the wrong man bleed
Sit there wit tha right one and give 'em three
See me, don't think cause I'm on tv
Dat a nigga won't massacre ya family

Gettin Krunk wit Lil Jon, he da livest in the south
Fuck around and you get wires in your mouth
Cowards I despise and my power keeps on risin 
Niggas try to hate me but they keep recognizin
Who's the next label I'ma bury
CEO's, rappers and A&R's go to the rap cemetery
And ya all got guns but ya scared to use 'em
Six million ways to die, nigga choose one
I'm a Braveheart I'll be right here
why'all talk shit but I smell fear, motherfucker!

Ay yo, all these niggas they afraid of the Bravehearts
I'll take a razor open your face up
I tried to tell these niggas we don't play
I run up on you broad day with a A-K
Cornball I can make your heart beat stop
Pop pop your body drop from a couple shots
When you see me in the street, we can handle the beef
If you see me in jail you know you dead meat
I be fighting and stabbin, shooting and laughing
My ratchet blast on top of you bastards
Committing sins in Cincinnati
We'll drive by in all black caddy's
A 21 gun salute
Your last words be, please Jungle don't shoot
Pussy, I'll put a slug between your eyes
And stand there and watch your punk ass die

[Wiz]
I'm fuckin' wit them, Bravehearts
My niggas is coming we just don't stop
why'all niggas is running I'm just goin pop
I twist up my gun up and slap your mouth
With Lil John down south
My religion is green motherfucker too late
Since birth, I'm cursed, the worst motherfucka in da state
Time and time again you niggas back down, laugh now
Fuck ya numbers nigga ya'll all fake
The hunt is on, fuck if I'm wrong, test my dead arm
Robbery, heavily armed, might leave him gone
Bang him duff him, actin like he don't know what's going on
Hang em' rush em' get his clown ass his teammates wrong
And oh he got a 22, give him the gauge the brave way
God ain't going to save his bitch ass today
Wait I'ma Braveheart I'll be right here

And now accountings send me checks in the mail
And I ain't got time for no sell

Too much money gotta stay on the DL
All these hoar hoes callin my cell

Livin that rich life I like that camotion
The bitch wit the titties out, got a nigga open
My jewelry be showin, heavy when we rollin
Please don't bring yo girl around me

Body hypnotic exotic as hell

She from my dreams
Girl taste good like carvelle ice cream
A few tattoo's on her butter soft skin
I gave my support when she had that abortion
Remember I could make you warm in the winter
Buy you a mink coat every December
And laugh and joke about the shit we been threw
Then you open your legs and say be gentle
I'll try I can see they spark in your eyes
It's gonna be fireworks like the fourth of July
Untouchable, unbreakable, intimate, multiple orgasms...
When I be rippin it
Your favorite positions, neighbors be listening, 
Hating and wishing that our relationship end
But you my brave girl

My baby girl is stuck stupid looking miserable ma keep your head up
Cause ma I'm right here let's do the damn thing girl it can't be love
Cause I be waiting a minute for your walk by
Listen I'm lifting your legs up in the air my only vision
While I'm stroking thinking about money and smoking
Hoping we could do this again and again and again and again yo
I feel your pain I'm leaving your mouth dry your man can't do this ma he to lame
Keep him of your brain
While you let me do me on you drove off as soon as I came

The time is now or never shorty screaming and yelling
Yo calm down and let my comrade tell it

Girl you look so sweet (so sweet girl)
But that is what you are (what you are baby)

Cause your my Braveheart girl (Bravehearts)
And will get high with each other uh huh (uh huh)

Phase one we meet and exchange numbers
Phase two is day two call you for a address to come to
Day three is phase three h-e-a-d usually
But cause we just met there is other interests

Now the motherfucker begging for more
Its the reason
Standing here shaking, hating the haters
They watching my paper
Realize, a 4 5 will open his eyes
Now what the fuck you think he saw before he drop

Now the soldier, cadet, general in fact
Don't let me get up and show yawl motherfucker's respect

The twinkle and diamonds upon my neck
More jazz than Hornecek
I blast and leave your corner wet
Straight on top of ya

In a school yard we make it hard
Was popping yawl
We made our change was stopping yawl

I miss the shit of days we did this
Please free John Gotti
They kept the black man eating, not killing everybody
Drug wars is real
You have no friends in the outfield
Foul balls is deaf, umpires keep ice grilles
there's no tomorrow its the bottom of the 9 9
Can't die a broke man with a bitch that's fine
My hearts full of braveness so who the fuck will want to save this
Fallen angel from fallen star and chaos on this nation
Don't play us on your station if you pussy or you hating
You can find us in the hood; thugging and regulating

Rege on the regular chops is up, like a editor
Come through on man gang like the predator

Air out your area, Queens Bridge forever, what

Shoot 'till the gun's empty stupid, Queens

Useless to these swift executioners

Yo' do you want to live or do you want to die

Like a river in tha sky, you'll be floatin in tha air
Got to see you're mother cry at the wake of tha year
I'll give her a hug and tell her be strong then
Smack her in tha face wit a forty-four long

I hope y'all acknowledge the hook on this song

For my seeds I even let the wrong man bleed
Sit there wit tha right one and give 'em three
See me, don't think cause I'm on tv
Dat a nigga won't massacre ya family
I love guns, and bustin 'em off for loved ones
Get it done, big or small one even for funds

And I hate most dudes dat ain't my blood

Terrific tight vagina
Very wet when I be deep inside her
My grandma said she was too fast
She was in the club shakin dat ass

Hangin out late, smokin and drinkin
Ready to pop off without even thinkin
She want the cash, the clothes, the cars
She want to lay up in the bed wit the stars

When this bitch is naked, she the sexiest
She possesed the kid like the exorcist
Her breast excellent, ""see"" cup titties
She be rollin my weed when I drive through New Yetti

What my niggas'll do
When we start movin' ill
That's when you know it ain't cool
It ain't safe man
This nigga watchin' my slang
That's when he wanted to hang
That's when he pledged to my gang
But we don't fuck wit no badges
Unless they takin' the blame
Of a 20 corpse masacare
And never sayin' my name
Blastin' ya
Never doin' a thang
I never heard nothin, seen nothin
Anyway
My Braveheart (?) will wet you
Hit you forget you
Throw the cops off
That nigga Wiz is a boss
I don't respect you
Hit 'em up with AK's
Bet you never come back
When I get you, nigga

Now when I pull out that thang
You know what I'ma do

And why'all already know who I'm better than

Never hit the club unless I get's my berretta in
The letter N, short for Nasir
More drama than the President with North Korea
Gettin Krunk wit Lil Jon, he da livest in the south
Fuck around and you get wires in your mouth
Cowards I despise and my power keeps on risin 
Niggas try to hate me but they keep recognizin
Who's the next label I'ma bury
CEO's, rappers and A&R's go to the rap cemetery
And ya all got guns but ya scared to use 'em
Six million ways to die, nigga choose one
I'm a Braveheart I'll be right here
why'all talk shit but I smell fear, motherfucker!

[Chorus]
[Jungle]
Ay yo, all these niggas they afraid of the Bravehearts
I'll take a razor open your face up
I tried to tell these niggas we don't play
I run up on you broad day with a A-K
Cornball I can make your heart beat stop
Pop pop your body drop from a couple shots
When you see me in the street, we can handle the beef
If you see me in jail you know you dead meat
I be fighting and stabbin, shooting and laughing
My ratchet blast on top of you bastards
Committing sins in Cincinnati
We'll drive by in all black caddy's
A 21 gun salute
Your last words be, please Jungle don't shoot
Pussy, I'll put a slug between your eyes
And stand there and watch your punk ass die

[Wiz]
I'm fuckin' wit them, Bravehearts
My niggas is coming we just don't stop
why'all niggas is running I'm just goin pop
I twist up my gun up and slap your mouth
With Lil John down south
My religion is green motherfucker too late
Since birth, I'm cursed, the worst motherfucka in da state
Time and time again you niggas back down, laugh now
Fuck ya numbers nigga ya'll all fake
The hunt is on, fuck if I'm wrong, test my dead arm
Robbery, heavily armed, might leave him gone
Bang him duff him, actin like he don't know what's going on
Hang em' rush em' get his clown ass his teammates wrong
And oh he got a 22, give him the gauge the brave way
God ain't going to save his bitch ass today
Wait I'ma Braveheart I'll be right here
why'all talk shit but I smell fear, mothafuckas!

Better get why
But in the end will you be satisfied
If your life
We got to realize (gotta realize)
Money, cars, niggas, bars, clothes
No tellin what you know 'bout us

Minked out fresh line
Beam it out seat recline
All these hood chicks admire my shine
47 inch links, all kind of pieces
Drugs scales remember the days of drug sells
And now accountings send me checks in the mail
And I ain't got time for no sell
Diver Rims spinnin on a new CL
Too much money gotta stay on the DL
All these hoar hoes callin my cell
Forward the calls to my voice mail
Nashawn fortune pervail
Got these bitches feelin me like a blind bitch'll feel brail
I coped diamonds it ain't hard to tell
For my shine have a lead fight my charm like the head light
I know everythin that there is to know
That you gotta know to blow

The D's and decoys try to destroy me
But I'mma...champ not a chump
I move swifin turn the pistol on the punks
But what will the jury say, think do
I can't think of that, fuck it
I might as well run cool
Through the projects like ""Batman & Robin""
Cops and robbers, but I'm liver
Kill you and hide ya
What could I do but be a project nigga
That'll engine somethin quicker for figgaz
I can't lie to you
I realized how to survive and get money stay alive
But all my niggas be so quick down and die
But all my thorugh nigga know they can't take that money to th sky

Yo, we confronted 2Pac smoked blunts wit Biggie
Got love from Suge Knight, did the clubs wit Diddy
I was just a lil kid when Nas from the Bridge
He would bail me from jail, keep me free from bids
Why play in the pool when I can surf in the ocean
Livin that rich life I like that camotion
The bitch wit the titties out, got a nigga open
My jewelry be showin, heavy when we rollin
Please don't bring yo girl around me
One look at Jungle she hand me the pussy
Just like a waitress servin my dinner
My diamonds be drippin, she need a bread winner
I burn C-notes hold 40 cal in plastics
Put fashion in the Benz, fuck it if I rap it
The money keep stackin in duffle bags and shit
We came a long way, ma tell 'em how we live

Then you lick my balls (my balls)
Give me that good pussy (pussy)
So I could knock down the walls

[Verse: Jungle]
Yo, it feels so good, shorty gobblin' and swallowin'
Baby bobbin' weed, the lips I bust on top of them
Your ass so fat, you see ghetto booty bounce up and down
Like the porno movie ""Girls Gone Wild"", swing it all around
Can I hit it like this? Like that?
I can't wait inside, from the back
Stand up, ma bend over, love, let me control ya
I fold ya, all up like a prep suit
I'll protect and caress you
I'll draw it boo, intellect you
Or disrespect you

Nigga she was addicted, to what the dick did
Had her going crazy, fucking with the lips kid
Doing it, come quick I might ruin it
So I gotta, switch positions and get in to it
And bitch you better hold on, for that ride
Riding the pipe, yes my dicks inside
I mean, my shit must have been made for this spot
Because I couldn't think of a better place (why not?)
Cause the weed and liquor is getting to me
In a flash, and that ass is where I'm supposed to be
Pussy take me to ecstasy, so I know when I beat it up good
You stand right next to me
And girl, you know that I do it all night
Fuck to the morning, I get it right
Brave-hearts, about to blow
G-w-i-z I'm telling these hoes

[Verse: Jungle]
Yo I rip it up right? (yeah aight)
I make a hoe want to turn into my housewife
The sex, the cash, I'm from the project I grew up fast
I had the old and the young hood rats
Mix some hypnotic and a konyache
Bitches on my dick, cause I bust my gat
So ménage trios, it'd be like that

[Verse: Grand Wiz]
So let me turn it up, tear it up
Eat it up, beat it up
When I'm in it, I think I fuck something
That'll get 'em rimming, when we
Blaze the haze, and sexing crazy
Fuck your friend whether she with it or hate it
Your brain is serious, put me on
Imma pimp or mack, then deal with the thong
It's Jung and Wiz, straight out the bridge
In the club bitches see us and they licking they lips

She from my dreams
Girl taste good like carvelle ice cream
A few tattoo's on her butter soft skin
I gave my support when she had that abortion
Remember I could make you warm in the winter
Buy you a mink coat every December
And laugh and joke about the shit we been threw
Then you open your legs and say be gentle
I'll try I can see they spark in your eyes
It's gonna be fireworks like the fourth of July
Untouchable, unbreakable, intimate, multiple orgasms...
When I be rippin it
Your favorite positions, neighbors be listening, 
Hating and wishing that our relationship end
But you my brave girl

My baby girl is stuck stupid looking miserable ma keep your head up
Cause ma I'm right here let's do the damn thing girl it can't be love
Cause I be waiting a minute for your walk by
Listen I'm lifting your legs up in the air my only vision
While I'm stroking thinking about money and smoking
Hoping we could do this again and again and again and again yo
I feel your pain I'm leaving your mouth dry your man can't do this ma he to lame
Keep him of your brain
While you let me do me on you drove off as soon as I came

Reverend do you hear what I'm telling you
The time is now or never shorty screaming and yelling
Yo calm down and let my comrade tell it

Girl you look so sweet (so sweet girl)
But that is what you are (what you are baby)
And no one comes between (nobody)
Never some moon and stars (that's right)
Some come sail away with me (me and you)
Cause your my Braveheart girl (Bravehearts)
And will get high with each other uh huh (uh huh)

[Nas]
Phase one we meet and exchange numbers
Phase two is day two call you for a address to come to
Day three is phase three h-e-a-d usually
But cause we just met there is other interests
Want to smother with teddy bears and lilly's
Wine and dine you I'm a gentleman but savage behind you
Know you feeling me my carrots will blind you

Three'd be hat trick
Gave him more shots than the pediatrics
Came to his house and shot his left hand out
Left him with more scars than Mr. Def Jam South
To reach the sky, how far would a star go
To handle more cigars than a Cuban cargo
Makin money from everything I spoke in this
Wrapped by more ice than a broken wrist
Got ability to make missy a little tipsy
I'm more P.I.M.P than Mississippi (git it? Uh!)

I know you like to show off you're bust in gowns
'cause you go around jugglin guys nuts around
And we don't gotta wait till you're ass confesses
'cause you go around showing off you're ass in dresses
You watchin porn sittin there at you're macintosh
With you're hand in you're ass like you're jackin off
And you try goin harder than star wars Anakin
'cause you practice at you're house with a anus manikin

got a belt full of steel you can call me santa
You better keep your eyes peeled like a fuckin banana
And don't try to shoot me like some dumb retards
'cause I miss bullets like I'm sendin them e-cards 
Always equipped with the vest so don't aim for the bell-ay
'cause I dodge bullets like I play for LA
And I'm invisible 'cause you can't even see me son
But you're soft as shit I could shoot you with a bb gun
They call me stretch where I'm from 'cause I'm extended out
Find your ass in my house and I'll send it out
I got a custom made gun so the cops link my shot

Bitches call me Horse the pussy filler
I'll fuck a big boned or slim chick
Beat that pussy up real quick then send home the bitch
Ain't no sleepin in my bedroom
When henny's in my dick
When Flex drop the bomb I bust a nut on this bitch
Deep throat, Caesar gold or pun wicked hoes
Who like the way I thug and the way I flow
I like head in the Benz, the four door or the Coupe
Head in the staircase, the cellar or the roof
Head in the studio, the bathroom or the booth
Head from a project chick or one with crazy loot
Like Nia Long in a cherry thong with the lights on
Sippin Perignon with Kelly Price on
I pull out my python, I hit it while my wife's gone

All of nature wild and free
This is where I long to be

And when the samba played
The sun would set so high
Ring through my ears and sting my eyes

Warm wind carried on the sea, he called to me
Te dijo te amo

They went so fast

When it's time for siesta you can watch them go by
Beautiful faces, no cares in this world
Where a girl loves a boy, and a boy loves a girl

But he caught it with his wallet and the tracks upon his skin
And if he follows that he swallowed the notion he was appolo
But he lost it, exhausted, so he pushed the needle in

In the street he mutters to himself

[Chorus]

Forsyth and Zebulon
Earhart and Komarov
Capucince and the cats on the Sultana
Were drinking their coffee and smoking havanas

""The Sky line is my line,"" said the rich man from his airplane
But he won't say that in his dream state he crashes in the woods

In
His sleep he mutter to himself

Where do we go from here?



",A Year in Heaven,2006
Brazil,"Yesterday morning upon my waking
Inside my pocket, I found a calling card
It said in cursive ""Meta-detective""
And had a number I didn't recognize
It rang all morning and in the evening
I heard an answer. It sounded like a sigh.
It was a woman on the receiver
(she was a breather)
I said I'd see her because you never know

She said she'd meet me under the marquee
Of a theater that was abandoned
She ran up to me and leaned in closely
Whispering softly, she told me how I would die
She spoke in cipher and coy conundrums
Her hair was like lightning and smelled like thunder
Ending our rendez-vous, she said ""Rappelea-vous?""
And with a pirouette, she disappeared and I said,
""You never know""

I'll let you be my eyes if we fly
I'll let you be my eyes because I'm blind
The rain flies into out mouths while our heads fly into the clouds

Que abrio caminos sin mas ley que su esperanza

Llorando en la inocencia de un ritmo jugueton
Por tu milagro de notas agoreras
Nacieron sin pensarlo las paicas why las grelas
Luna en los charcos, canyengue en las caderas
Why un ansia fiera en la manera de querer
Al evocarte, tango querido
Siento que tiembran las baldosas de un bailongo
Why oigo el resongo de mi pasado

Siento que llega en punta e' pie para besarme
Cuando tu canto nace al son de un bandoneon....

I'll be so blue just thinking about you
Decorations of red on a green Christmas tree

That's when those blue memories start calling

Brazos Valley Boys,"I'll tell you 'bout my night on shore if you will lend an ear
I stepped into a cabaret to get myself a beer
A pretty girl sat all alone and needed company
But when I got close, this girl a rose this is what she said to me

Now she said, ""Whoa sailor, be careful what you do
In your eye there's a gleam
And to me it seems you're just like all the rest
With a wolfish eye and a line that's sly than a sailor's at his best""

""Now look here, babe, you've got me wrong, I'm not that kinda guy
I just got back from across the seas where there are no gals arie
Now let me talk to you a while, I'm sure you'll see my way""
But when I went to spout she turned about this is what she had to say

Now she said, ""Whoa sailor, I've heard that line before
You'll look into my eyes
And tell me lies and tales of the seven seas
But a sailor's full of that kinda bull so don't hand it to me

""Oh pretty girl, you've let me down, you've broken my poor heart
And oh, how it hurt when you had to spurt that last sad remark""
I said, ""I think I'll have a drink and I broke out six month's pay""
With a wide open eyes she breathed a sigh this time she had to say

Now she said, ""Whoa sailor, I think you've won my heart""
Well, she was right neat and she sure was sweet
But I knew she was that sort but she's not all to blame
'Cause it's a sailor's aim to have a girl in every port",Whoa Sailor,2004
Brazos Valley Boys,"Well, you wouldn't read my letters if I wrote you
You asked me not to call you on the phone
There's something I've been waiting for to tell you
So I wrote it in the words of this song

You never knew there were honky tonk angels
Or you might have known I'd never make a wife
You walked out on the only one who ever loved you
So I went back to the wild side of life

Now the glamor of the good life always lead me
To the places where the wild liquor flows
I tried to be your one and only angel
But I'm not that kind of angel, heaven knows

I cried so hard the day you went and left me
'Cause some things you said, they cut me like a knife
What you wanted was another kind of angel
And you should be back to the wild side of life

No, well, I guess I'm just a honky tonk angel
I might have known I'd never make a wife
Well, you left the only one who ever loved you
And I'm back here on the wild side of life

I'm only a honky tonk angel
I might have known I'd never make a wife
You walked out on the only one who ever loved you
And you left me here on the wild side of life",The Wild Side of Life,2004
Brazos Valley Boys,"Where there's dim lights and there's liqueur, they'll find you each night
The jukebox will be playing your favorite song tonight
You're the loneliest fool that's living in your make believe world
You're a honky tonk sweetheart and anybody's girl
Though you chose the life that lead you to sorrow and shame
Each shoulder that you cry on, you swear that I'm to blame
You gave up the one that loved you to live in your sorted world
You're a honky tonk sweetheart and anybody's girl
You can't say I didn't love you as you're crying in your beer
You drink to every heartache and wish that I was near
With each drink you passion surges and start your head to whirl
You're a honky tonk sweetheart and anybody's girl
I don't understand your feelings but emotions are strange things
Why you gave up the life your leading and gave up your wedding ring
You flaunt your charms and beauty and toss your pretty curls
You're a honky tonk sweetheart and anybody's girl

Bre,"Oh this is a song from my soul
This time I won't sweat it, I'm gonna let it go

I don't recognize my own face no more
I stare in a mirror than turn and it's gone
Nameless and famous changing my alias
Manafest and Chris fighting for the right placement
1979 I was born 1995 I grabbed a board
1999 I wrote a song, spit a metaphor
Went from amateur to entrepreneur
You still don't know me, you dudes can't touch me
Stab me, kill me, hug me or love me
Inside I'm a person, hurting, and working
Pouring myself out, putting my neck out
Can you see him? I tell them I'm right here
He still won't come out he's rivaled with fear
Examined by the critics, and put on this dis list
I won't be jaded though I'm starting to see it
They don't respect him he's just another musician

[Chorus]
Oh this is a song from my soul
This time I won't sweat it, I'm gonna let it go
I won't stress I'll just do my best
Yeah!!! You've taken up all my cares
Given me eye sight and meaning
And I'll let the whole world know about you

The voice of suicide
Used to creep up in my mind
The fat kid could care less if I lived or died
I didn't think it had affect on me
But now I'm twenty five watching my weight size, I'm really scrawny
The name calling, bullying from the hooligans
The who's in, who's not had no friends
My audience is triple the size of that now
All eyes on me shall I rap now
Thank you all for coming to my show
Thank you for burning my cd that you stole
When I get desperate I write a message
My rhymes the essence of day to day lessons
Feeling butt naked my pride has been taken
Every mistake that I've made there taping
Can I find peace, can I find me
Who's the real man that's hiding behind the emcee?
I want to know

What's real, what's not, what's real Super star Chorus
Oh this is a song from my soul
This time I won't sweat it, I'm gonna let it go
I won't stress I'll just do my best
Yeah!!! You've taken up all my cares
Given me eye sight and meaning
And I'll let the whole world know about you

We may not agree on everything or anything
By any means I'm a fulfill the dream
I seen it come and go, I've tried to grab hold
Hope I don't end up losing my soul
Hip hop ain't worth it I've served and cursed it
Sacrificed to make it work, and lost my purpose
It's not what I'd die for to risk my wife and all
Strife cause can't compare the lives it's caught
I am Christian, emceeing a gifting, hip hop's what I'm living
Not replacing religion,
I got relationship with a God in the sky
He talks to me defines wrong and the right
Talk to him, when you're walking or jogging
Skating or playing, or painting or balling
I'm a pass the mic, I on a path for Christ
Let me tell ye the, shoot I'm out a time

I knew that I belonged

Belonging to someone I find is very necessary
The load is lighter on your mind
When someone helps to carry
And even though I'm strong enough
To make it on my own
I would not even care to try
To live my life alone

For if I lived my life alone
With no one to belong to
There'd be no one to pledge my heart
Or sing my song of love to

He'll loosen my hold on you
But they just don't know that you're free to go

Always bring my feelings right out loud,
Whether I'm ashamed or proud.

And on this airplane coming home to you,
Sometimes I think I've flown my whole life through,
My whole life through,
As I wing my way to you.

See the clouds, they're giving life below
In colors that the canvass cannot show;
Keeping secrets no one else could know,
For I'm the one who told them so.

Like to stay, but I'm just passing through,
So I'll have to say goodbye,

And started reading about me
The words she's written took me by surprise
You'd never read them in her eyes.
They said that she had found the love she waited for.
Wouldn't you know it, she wouldn't show it.

When she confronted with the writing there,
Simply pretended not to care.
I passed it off as just in keeping with
Her total disconcerting air

The love that she denied,

And as I go through my life, I will give to her my wife
All the sweet things that I can find.

He really took it too hard
Did anyone try to see
Why did I leave him alone

I though you'd carry on
I thought that you would be strong, but you're a victim
You can't look me in the face

You know I've eaten your lies
You know I've swallowed your pride
You know that you can't disguise
You can't look me in the eyes

You could never be found
I tried to set you free
But you were dead to the sound and now

Correction Notes:

Said her name was romance, I said I'm impulsive.
Swallowed my nerve and ate my dignity.
I think I'm making progress, she's faking naive, 
All this false innocence amuses me.

I don't mean to rush, or be obvious
But like a magnet you keep pulling me.
Into fixation, this mad compulsion.
Don't wanna stop. Will you come with me?

Can I take you home?
Open yourself up to me and surrender.
Can I take you home?
We lock out the world and we'll stay here forever.
Say it to me, three letters.
Fall from your mind to your mouth.
Can I take you home?

Am I second guessing?
Am I asking too much?
One simple word will set the record straight.
Betrayed by clenched hands.
Wear your smile like a mask.
Your tightened fists, they give your heart away.

I don't mean to rush, or be obvious, 
But my impatience keeps on dragging me
Into temptation, this mad compulsion.
And tell me now, will you come with me?

Can I take you home?
Open yourself up to me and surrender.
Can I take you home?
We lock out the world and we'll stay here forever
Say it to me, three letters.
Fall from your mind to your mouth
Can I take you home?

Said her name was romance, I said I'm impulsive.

Wear your smile like a mask.

And contaminates all of my days

When you spoke my name,
Now I can't wait, to see you again

When something is right,
I feel like I must have known you,
In another life,
Cause I felt this deep connection,
When you looked in my eyes,
Now I can't wait to see you again,

When you called and asked to see me

That you can't wait to see me again

The TV light fills my heart like a balloon 
I hold it in as best I can 
I know I'm just another fan 
But I can't help feeling I could love this secret agent man 
I can't... 

Wait anymore for him to discover me 
I got it bad for David Duchovny 
David Duchovny, why won't you love me? 
Why won't you love me? 

My friends all tell me, 
â??Girl you know it's just a show 
But deep within his eyes 
I see me wrapped up like a bow 
Watching the sky for a sign 
The FBI is on my mind 
I'm waiting for the day 
When my lucky stars align 
In the form of... 

David Duchovny floating above me 
In the alien light of the spaceship of love, I need 
David Duchovny hovering above me 
American Heathcliff, brooding and comely 
David Duchovny, why won't you love me? 
Why won't you love me? 

So smooth and so smart 
He's abducted my heart 
And I'm falling apart 
From the looks I receive 
From those eyes I can't leave 
And you can say I'm naive 
But he told me to believe 

My bags are packed, I am ready for my flight 
Want to put an end to my daydream days and sleepless nights 
Sitting like a mindless clone 
Wishing he would tap my phone 
Just to hear the breath of the man, the myth, the monotone 
And I would say... 

David Duchovny, why won't you love me? 
Why won't you love me? Why won't you love me? 
David Duchovny, why won't you love me? 
Why won't you love me? Why won't you love me? 
David Duchovny I want you to love me 
To kiss and to hug me, debrief and debug me 
David Duchovny I know you could love me 
I'm sweet and I'm cuddly-I'm gonna kill Scully!

Why won't you love me? Why won't you love me?

Where are the angels, angels, angels?
Where are the angels, angels, angels?""

Like teardrops of fire, still her voice is as sweet

Where they take away, take away the pain that they know?

I'd pierce my heart if I thought things would change
But I'm just like the skin that's been stung and restung
And the campfire songs that are sung and resung
For a girl of my age why am I so numb?

I've been chasing a lie I was sold
Running down thieves and fool's gold
And these Christmas dreams are just painted coal

I've been swallowed up by greed.  I've been spat upon by lust
If they ain't playing with your money they're playing with your trust
And I'm trying so hard to stop sitting still
To gather the juice that's been spent or been spilled
To find a spark in myself that hasn't been killed 
Cause if Death doesn't get you then Life surely will

I've been chasing a lie I was sold
Running down thieves and fool's gold

Clacking while the cement mixes

Sleazy gropers pushing dope 
Sometimes survivals only hope's 
A mouth that needs a wash with soap 
And water couldn't clean this town 
The sewers run above the ground 
The streets are like a lost and found 
For vagabonds who spew sounds from the gutter 
Guttermouth, mothers disapprove 
Of the vile talk and lewdness 
Miss, stop the filth protruding from that 
Guttermouth, though they try so hard to punish 
The boys all want to run with 
The guttermouth, guttermouth

But all they see is ?
A perfect lady looks that way 
Knows what she can and cannot say 
To the bending men who alter their 
Direction as they try to halt her 
Caterwaul as they assault her 
After all this can you fault her guttermouth

Is showing her identity 
Ain't in sainthood, but obscenity

And when I'm done, don't expect no apology
Stupid motherfuckers shoulda stepped when I warned 'em
I'm from the Boondocks of Compton, California
I'm just anxious to whoop some ass
I went to high school, but I flunked every class
So what makes you think I give a fuck about respect?
I'll put your bitch in check, and I'll bet
You won't run up, son of a punk and a bitch, too
I shoulda did a drive by on you and your crew
Cuz ya'll be poppin' some shit that's unheard of
For you, what's the word? Uh (wack!) it's murder, son
When I be crushin' your hood with a passion
And I ain't talkin' that Action Jackson
When I come you better run for ammo
Or get played like a fuckin' piano

And yo, we got my homeboy Ice Cube in the house from the motherfuckin'
Lench Mob (what's up, nigga?), and yo Ice Cube, I heard you're a singer now
Man what's up? Yo, yo

Do-Ray-Me. But I don't sing, mothafucker
I kick shit with the King, mothafucker
Ice Cube will clock the cash, rock the mass
And if you run up, I'll sock your ass
And watch that eye get swollen
Cuz I'm playin' punk niggas like Beethoven
So bust a cap or swing and die
Fuck Yul Brynner, it's still The King and I
Cuz where I'm from the sun don't shine
So One-Time hope I only bust one rhyme
But I bust one more for the suckers
Last year I was Ruthless, now I'm Lenchin' mothafuckers
And you'll see in a tree, MCs and crews
Now they're lookin' for me, King Tee, and Pooh
Now every nigga that crossed me's soprano
Cuz I played their ass like a fuckin' piano

Yo, check this out, we got my homeboy Breeze in the
Motherfuckin' house from the L.A. Posse
and he got some shit to holler
Come
On, man, bust this shit

Well, I'm-a take the mic like it was a jack move
Run with the beat as long as the track moves
Hot as lava, organized like a seminar
Serve you, your crew, him, and them and a
Couple of rap-saps who think they can get butt
You slipped and shit, so nitwit, just get the nuts
Stealin' your high hopes, watchin' you write notes
Better walk a chalk line, not fuckin' a tightrope
Rap slicker, thicker, quicker than others, then I stop swift
Shift from 1st to 5th, while you stop to shoplift
Take the mic stand whenever the duty calls
If I bust a nut for every rhyme I had, I'd get blue balls
Serious as drama, I'm-a watch her say ""Me too.""
You're shorter than Michu, your rhymes are see-through
You're nothin' like GQ, transparent, I made it apparent
I'm here to wax and tax the incoherent
Cuz B-R-E-E-Z-E will eas-i-ly re-main to be-e a top MC
When you see me, I wear a beanie, and not a Kangol
Now you got played, like a fuckin' piano

This is just a sample of three black nig-roes
Who grew up in the heart of the ghetto
Doin' what we had to just to make ends meet
Some steal for a livin', some stand on the street
Just slang. Some gang-bang, but big deal
They say in Compton, you gotta kill or get killed
Mothafuckin' police pull ya over, slam ya down
Then tell ya that your hood is their town
And I ain't goin' for no shit like that;
Cuff me up, take me to jail, I'll come back
Talkin' much shit, cuz I talk what the fuck I feel
A few weeks in the county ain't no big deal
So a punk like you can't fuck with me
That big ballin'-ass nigga named King Tee
You think ya can? I don't think that you can, though

[Breeze]
It didn't break, wipin my ass
I couldn't wait, swipin my cash (""A dollar?"")
I hollered, ""Let's be out!""
We bout to set it on the Ave
Forget it think about the shorties I'ma bag
(""Look at him!"" ""Yeah he cut a pretty clown"")
Cousin by side of honies sweatin
But he was too busy with money gettin
(""Whattup son, could you spare some change?"")
Just gettin cheddar, so then I see some of my other fellas
(""Whassup my niggaz!"" ""Aiyyo that motherfucker kinda strange"")
Holdin it down son, we stood there, yo check it son
Shorty looked kinda good (Yeah then what?)
Umm, we stood there (She got a body!)
Yeah my nigga, look how she flauntin it
(She probably snotty) Yo word is bond, yo I don't want that bitch
Some sucker in a Lex' took her (Fuck her)
Gimme that next hooker, a shorty not a hoe, but horny on the low
(No doubt) Well I'm bettin this chick could do the job and check it
I'ma be the motherfuckin don and show her I'm bout to steady slobbin'

[Chorus]

[Breeze]
She all alone (These niggaz must be scared of the ass)
She overgrown, I think she kinda big
As I pass, yo she's sort of healthy
(What that mean, a healthy appetite?)
I'm like, ""Yo I'ma go for delf see"" (Go for delf be	, that's right)
Swingin that ""Love yo how you doin?"" She responded to the mackin
Love returned to my pursuin just like fondlein the sack
And sayin, ""Finally I got one, I know the short stay""
And we up in this sorta hot son, continued foreplay
And then BLAOW we steady thumpin
""Yo hold up Boo yo that's my belly button
Gimme a second, let me get.."" UHHH, the jelly comin!
""Great"" Of course yo love I'm never satisfied
""Yo you couldn't wait some?"" Yo after I hit her I had her cryin
Yo shorty catchin feelings, then you know a nigga snuck out
""You call that sexual healing? GET THE FUCK OUT!""
But first a nigga sittin on the throne to drop this bomb
And then I gather up the motherfuckin squad
And continue to steady slobbin'..

When my glock spot em, then for you snake you gonna crawl 
Crumblin, messin wit me, definitely humblin 
Mumblin mercy, thirsty I need to hear it 
I need your spirit decimated, desecrated my core up to the extreme 
Before you do your next scheme, deserve to leave you sufferin 
You gots to catch a payback, from her to me 
Your brother been your brother kid from way back 
Ain't no shame in your drama 
You will be feelin the heat from you stealin my beat 
Down to you gamin my mama 
Aimin a bomb to finish wit you, diminsh split you 
You done pushed me, shit I didn't even get to kill that pussy 
But now I'm bout to kill it, fill it, spill it on this pavement

Just ask one of them niggas to pull the book out
I state this on my word bond, just put him on
In time he'll come up shinin like a mothafuckin Don

[Tariq/Breeze]
I Gets Money like Lil Kim
Could take a facial, to make em paint skill forget it dunn
My shit'll win you jackpots
Commishion be officially a crack spot wit a purpose
I get my service then niggas serve us
A neighborhood infested, that's the good investment
I peeps your operation, let a nigga give me most high
I never been arrested, but expect the unexpected
Wit full pre-meditation, when I run in wit po-nine I freaks the amnesia
Or maybe like I be strung out
Catchin a damn seizure, fuck it I bites my tongue out
Nuttin to lose, cousin your crews a top notch, Lex and Benz
Run through niggas blocks like hop scotch

Chorus
[Outro] 
[Tariq/Breeze]
I'm sayin, complete and total detriment to society
Yo, a match made in hell, word is bond
A wonderful day for the organization
It's just gon' be perfect for everybody involved
You get money, I get money, everybody get money
Everybody shine, as neighborhoods decline

It's two o'clock, and who that knockin on the door?
It's like a drum, that's Momma Dukes, ballin, callin me a bum
And then I'm comin to my senses (Yo Dunn, you gotta represent)
Then I see a woman lookin bold, with a cold cup of water
I'm like, ""see'mon Momma, gimme five more minutes""
As we begin it's sun shinin in it my eyes I'm done whinin
Then I rise, I gets the hygiene cleaning
So I'm calling up my peoples then I'm gone
But wait, I notice Momma with the cooking - (""Good looking"")
The eggs, the grits, and yo the muffins
I guess I can sample a little somethin
Sit and think about the night past, stuffin my face
I'm steady thinkin bout that tight ass - I didn't hit it
But whatever, I ate the pudding yo word is bond
That shit was good and yo I said, ""Love hit me off""
She said she wouldn't, ""Get the HELL off!""
There go the door yo that's the mob and whassup my niggaz?
Just let me drop this bomb and we can start to steady slobbin'

[Chorus]
""Have you ever seen such a sight in your life..""
Steady slobbin'!
""Have you ever seen such a sight in your life..""
""Like an all-day sucker!""
Steady slobbin'!

[Breeze]
It didn't break, wipin my ass
I couldn't wait, swipin my cash (""A dollar?"")
I hollered, ""Let's be out!""
We bout to set it on the Ave
Forget it think about the shorties I'ma bag
(""Look at him!"" ""Yeah he cut a pretty clown"")
Cousin by side of honies sweatin
But he was too busy with money gettin
(""Whattup son, could you spare some change?"")
Just gettin cheddar, so then I see some of my other fellas
(""Whassup my niggaz!"" ""Aiyyo that motherfucker kinda strange"")
Holdin it down son, we stood there, yo check it son
Shorty looked kinda good (Yeah then what?)
Umm, we stood there (She got a body!)
Yeah my nigga, look how she flauntin it
(She probably snotty) Yo word is bond, yo I don't want that bitch
Some sucker in a Lex' took her (Fuck her)
Gimme that next hooker, a shorty not a hoe, but horny on the low
(No doubt) Well I'm bettin this chick could do the job and check it
I'ma be the motherfuckin don and show her I'm bout to steady slobbin'

[Chorus]

[Breeze]
She all alone (These niggaz must be scared of the ass)
She overgrown, I think she kinda big
As I pass, yo she's sort of healthy
(What that mean, a healthy appetite?)
I'm like, ""Yo I'ma go for delf see"" (Go for delf be	, that's right)
Swingin that ""Love yo how you doin?"" She responded to the mackin
Love returned to my pursuin just like fondlein the sack
And sayin, ""Finally I got one, I know the short stay""
And we up in this sorta hot son, continued foreplay
And then BLAOW we steady thumpin
""Yo hold up Boo yo that's my belly button
Gimme a second, let me get.."" UHHH, the jelly comin!
""Great"" Of course yo love I'm never satisfied
""Yo you couldn't wait some?"" Yo after I hit her I had her cryin
Yo shorty catchin feelings, then you know a nigga snuck out
""You call that sexual healing? GET THE FUCK OUT!""
But first a nigga sittin on the throne to drop this bomb
And then I gather up the motherfuckin squad
And continue to steady slobbin'..

[Chorus]

If you knock on my door  you better been there before 
'Cause for trespassin  you know I got the cure 
I sleep wit hot lead  and it'll be dawn 'fore dead 
I'll let my girl go 'fore my gun leaves my bed 
Every man want heaven  but no man want dead 
As the pope once said, 'fore the dred lost his head 
So I keep my door locked, my gun cold-cocked 
First nigga that knock, I'm lightin up the whole block 
Test me not if you don't want to get hot 
'Cause I have missing posters filled wit all you hard rocks 
And I suggest, if you don't want to get blessed 
Just remember to wear your bullet-proof vest

It's showdown, brother high noon 
My soul questin like old Westerns 
The low down gonna die soon 
The True fake, you gonna fall to rock-bottom 
When my glock spot em, then for you snake you gonna crawl 
Crumblin, messin wit me, definitely humblin 
Mumblin mercy, thirsty I need to hear it 
I need your spirit decimated, desecrated my core up to the extreme 
Before you do your next scheme, deserve to leave you sufferin 
You gots to catch a payback, from her to me 
Your brother been your brother kid from way back 
Ain't no shame in your drama 
You will be feelin the heat from you stealin my beat 
Down to you gamin my mama 
Aimin a bomb to finish wit you, diminsh split you 
You done pushed me, shit I didn't even get to kill that pussy 
But now I'm bout to kill it, fill it, spill it on this pavement 
Your scream'll satisfy my Wes Craven/craving

My plan to hard rock shit be snappin at your neck 
I thirst for beef, hot lead spells relief 
So play your position, brave nigga I'm the chief 
And all that hard rock shit gon get you closer to redrum 
And reachin for your pistol, I can say that's quite dumb 
So leave it alone, you've been dethroned 
That's only if your black ass want to make it home 

You're gettin carried away 
Wit pallbearers, twist you while I'm wettin 
That be the way it's all clear wit Mr. L 
Gone black, I'm tellin him you was plottin for cheddar 
To hell wit him, you forgotten 
Against my contract, we could do this like Judas 
Blast you wit your style, mastered it so foul 
Leave you clueless like ""who this?"" 
Carma caught you kid, I'm fuckin sicker than true lies 
I'ma scorch a nigga, comin thicker wit new rise 
It's hard to live, knowin that you doin the same 
Knowin about you and your game, let God forgive

I give a buck in gross earning, you eatin the heat in my toast burnin

Yo, I?ll send this to alla my corporate corpses
Trying to abort the thoughts, coming out wilin? 
Time to off the office,
I was surely sort of twisted
Worked at a tv studio, an audio assistant
Easy, do my duty, though at times was in a ?me? mood
Hot I gotta be cool
I was on the brink of fiends truth
Livin in the green room
Made a brother the same color but beyond neon
Pushing me to peon
Barking at dreams to be gone
???talent and many they haven?t any
Was especially a challenge 
When you be like goddamnit
Can he lift his vocal
As he?s cuffing it, how my mic sound?
Thinking on the low, it?s perfect when he put the mic down
Clown stand steady, willing wanting subservient
Sound man blurting in thinking I?d fucking murder them
Steaming when I?m watching duke
Scheming on some hot pursuit
Gotta win as these cats be modelin? what not to do


In a getaway car
In a getaway car 
In a getaway car, car, car, car

In a getaway car
In a getaway car 
In a getaway car, car, car, car


Six in the morning
And the walls close in
High noon calls
And the walls on him
Kings at the ready
Now the walls won?t win

Aesop Rock
Storms on the harbor, like a harbinger of bore
Gore?s my harbinger, pardon the art of war
Get your door?s darkened by the house of card carpenters
Who never thought a slave could be a Spartacus or
Pencil sharpener with a resume for the carnivores
Take important conference calls
In corner office walls
Stealin buckets
A bunch of these punch numbers
Five punch just say no to company functions
And I duck into the dungeons
Nothing says kill it 
Like a day of pinching paperclips and staplers for the privilege
Two lives, one is chores for whores
One is where I wanna be when you begin regretting yours
And I?m boredom with a large coffee
Tardy every morning
To a man who authority beyond what it was for
How you gonna pay the rent?
Day job great
Make rap records matter fact thanks!
Peace!


In a getaway car
In a getaway car 
In a getaway car, car, car, car

In a getaway car
In a getaway car 
In a getaway car, car, car, car


Six in the morning
And the walls close in
High noon calls
And the walls on him
Kings at the ready
Now the walls won?t win

I?m leaving?
