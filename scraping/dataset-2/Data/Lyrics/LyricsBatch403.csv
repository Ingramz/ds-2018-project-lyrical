"James ""Jimmy"" Atkins","We were doing so well,
We had broken the spell,
And freedom seemed just within reach
We had managed the bend,
Between lover and friend,
Found a place we could possibly meet

Yes it's me,
I can't help myself,
I just run headlong to defeat,
Yes it's me,
I can't help myself,
I defeat, I defeat, I defeat, I defeat

I'm so hard on myself,
Don't deserve any help,
So I must let you go, let you go.
So I pushed you away,
While I hoped you would stay,
But I don't let you know, let you know

Yes it's me,
I can't help myself,
I keep running around to this beat,
Yes it's me,
I can't help myself,
I defeat, I defeat, I defeat, I defeat

Yes it's me,
I can't help myself,
I keep running around to this beat,
Yes it's me,
I can't help myself,
I defeat, I defeat, help me",I Defeat,2002
"James ""Jimmy"" Atkins","Lost my house, lost my love
Swept away in a raging flood
I... I'm still alive

I believe God is testing me,
But I can't take what the Lord decrees
I... I'm still alive

On a Monday life was swell,
By Wednesday I'm in Hell
But I'm still alive

Bankers came to move me on
So strapped for cash, I had to sell this song
I... I'm still alive

Doctor told me I've a terrible disease
The dog's run off and the cat's got fleas
I... I'm still alive

On a Monday life was swell
By Wednesday I'm in Hell
But I'm still alive

By the Thursday life was sad
By Good Friday life's too bad
But I'm still alive

Out the window, four vultures on a tree
Licking their beaks and they're talking about me
I... I'm still alive

"James ""Jimmy"" Atkins","Falling, falling into you,
Falling, no parachute
You lost all self-control,
We don't know,
Which way you might go,
I found a map you left,
No use,
Can't tell east from west.

Heading out on this mercy trail,
You look so strong,
Feel so frail,
Need a friend in this barren land,
All your approaches have failed,
Hope you come through.

Falling, falling into you,
Falling, no parachute
Are you receiving me,
Read my lips,
A foreign language,
I'm not deceiving you,
Take my hand,
It's a bridge.

Heading out on this mercy trail,
You look so strong,
Feel so frail,
See the world through a preacher's eyes,
Now all of your preaching has failed,
Hope you come through

"James ""Jimmy"" Atkins","Tonight
I had this dream but my vision was cracked
Drifting away you said you're not coming back
You're moving out while I'm flat on my back

You're making me happy
I was always sad
Whenever I'm happy my dreams are sad

Make me happy tonight
Make me happy tonight
Make me happy tonight

We must go on now there's no turning back
Kiss my defenses with one of those counter attacks
I'm exposed, shown you too much
Now you're invading my dreams

Making me happy
I was always sad
Afraid to be happy, that's so sad

Make me happy tonight

"James ""Jimmy"" Atkins","Please believe me when I'm crying
My sincere apologies
You had faith
I was lying
How indiscreet

Couldn't save myself from the calling of my flesh
Desire turned out much stronger than belief
In a stranger's arms I finally found some rest
Undertaker, undertaker

Everywhere I look is Satan
Making cash and laughing back at me
I'm afraid it's my reflection
Am I deceived?

I've become possessed
But that's special
And by the Lord I'm blessed
In ecstasy
And all my choices disappear
And I'm special
While the people hold me dear
Are you following me?
Are you following me?

Now I can feel some spirit entering me
And I am hoping it's God I receive
But I am open to be deceived
Are you following me?
Are you following me?

"James ""Jimmy"" Atkins","What a life
A trick of light
Then everything returns to the sea
You can have whatever you want
But are you disciplined enough to be free

Turning love into a chore
Promises come cheap dear reader
Another page, another door
Follow, follow me

I know what I'm here for
Hanging on through late December
I know what I'm here for
Follow, follow me

Moving on
Don't belong
My life turned into a mall
Every line is in the song
Follow me out of the fall

What an actor, what a show
Going through some holy motions
The bands are sharp but the singers slow
Everything must go

I know what I'm here for

Souvenirs, polygraph tests
Photographs fresh from the wreck
What a poster saint he'll make
In one take, one take

"James ""Jimmy"" Atkins","Someone's got it in for me
I don't want your sympathy
Life just never turned out how I wanted it to

Should have been a shooting star
Could have made it past the bar
Would have been a winner if I'd ever got that far

What a state I'm in
My self pitying
Here's another victim singing suffering

If only I had made the grade
Been more loved, been less afraid
If only I had scored the goal, got the girl or even played

What a state I'm in
My self pitying
Here's another victim singing suffering

Fall, let it fall away these lies
To be born again then fall
Let it fall away these lies
To be born again, to be born again

My life's turned to minor chords
Loser sad and life's a bore
Can't see the point in living in this fashion anymore

What a state I'm in

Here's another victim selling suffering

Fall, let it fall away these lies
To be born again then fall
Let it fall away these lies
To be born again, to be born again

"James ""Jimmy"" Atkins","Drifting through the atmosphere
Through the afterglow
Witnessing 1,000 lives I'll blow
Where the wind blows

Falling in between the lines
Never fitting in
Someone tell me what's my crime
Too thin, I'm too thin

Due to come back down
Due to come back down
Don't wanna, don't wanna land

Due to come back down

I don't wanna, don't wanna land

Don't wanna, don't wanna land
Land, land

This time I've a staring role
Hide the shape I'm in
I'm too old to sacrifice for gold and skin
For gold and skin, for gold, for gold

"James ""Jimmy"" Atkins","I nearly died when you jumped in
But you had to drown before you could swim
All the people on the beach, they were so impressed
That they wanted to join you but no they wouldn't undress
Oh there, that wetness, splashed their skin
So they prayed for a whirlpool to pull you in
Ya ho
Ya ho
Ya ho

So they looked away and they tried to pretend
That it was for you, but no it wasn't for them
Now the fear of sinking remains in place
But it's this fear of failure that a real disgrace

Ya ho
Ya ho
Let me be the one
Let me be the one
Let me be the one
Let me be the one
To get over you wall
To get over you wall

Heads in the sand, sea out of reach
Swept away by the games of the beach
Those people sat and watched your stand
While the wait of their fears pulled them underground
Will anyone learn from the stories that are told
Of the tribe who drown in a grave of gold

Ya ho
Ya ho
Ya ho
Ya ho
Ya ho
Ya ho

I see your heads down
Someone's calling
Put you heads down
Someone's drowning
Look up see what's fit for your eyes
Some escaping on someone drowning

Your head is underground
Your head is underground
Your head is underground
Your head is under the ground

Carve a face from the wood, an effigy
Make wings from the leaves, hide from the bark

Someone to catch the light

Draw the blue from the skies into his eyes
Carve the lines on his face, a map of the race
Juice from the root of a beet for his skin
Set the tides of the blood with the pulse of the drum

Someone to catch the light

Press his lips to your lips, give him your breath

Sees the rent in time through which he must fold

Well behind their curtain

As they try to plug that leak
I am tempted by their cloak of secrecy
To find out what their games are about
Ask a question and they'll talk of secret services
Secrets from the people they should serve
When they can hide their crimes in a legal disguise
Truth will not be seen nor heard


In ireland they may shoot to kill without
Warning you
Or lock you away for a while without trial
And if an honest cop gets to close to the
Truth of it
They'll set him up in style in style

Their youth
Who are questioning
How their lives are controlled
Do they have the means to rewrite history
Wipe out the genes of doubt

Greater than my stinking life
If I serve you to the end
I will find some peace

The sound that lovers make
As they drop down from the window
Quiet as cats, across the courtyard
Moving from shadow to shadow
Past the guards to the forest
So quiet in her still reflection
Drawing them down, drawing them down to the lake
To the center of her attention

Before the morning
Steal the moon tonight
I just love a good mystery
And on the West Bank a boat is being pulled 
Across the sands they move so softly
Slip into water
Oars dip, don't break the moon's reflection
And drift like a cloud
To the center
Beneath her cool attention
Still water

I've seen you rising from shore to shore
I want to drown in your moon dream

So I brought myself a gun
The salesman called it freedom
So my enemy bought a bigger one

I'm saving up for a missile
That will shoot him up with love
Now his finger's on my button
And my hand is in his glove

By Wednesday I'm in Hell

Licking their beaks and they're talking about me

To be born again then fall

"James ""Son"" Thomas","She grabs her magazines
She packs her things and she goes
She leaves the pictures hanging on the wall, she burns all
Her notes and she knows, she's been here too few years
To feel this old

He smokes his cigarette, he stays outside 'til it's gone
If anybody ever had a heart, he wouldn't be alone
He knows, she's been here too few years to be gone

And we always say, it would be good to go away someday
But if there's nothing there to make things change
If it's the same for you I'll just hang

The trouble understand, is she got reasons he don't
Funny how he couldn't see it at all 'til she grabbed up her coat
And she goes, she's been here too few years to take it all in stride
But still it's much too long, to let hurt go (you let her go)

And we always say, it would be good to go away, someday
But if there's nothing there to make things change
If it's the same for you I'll just hang
The same for you
I'll always hang

Well I always say, it would be good to go away

Go walkabout, I've got the bends from pressure
This is a testing time when the choice is mine
Am I a fool for love or foolish with desire
You can throw him out you can spit on him
Call what he does a sin if it makes you feel better

And I can't believe you're all I'll ever need
And I need to feel that you're not holding me
And the way I feel just makes me want to scream
Come home, come home, come home
Come home, come home, come home

After thirty years I've become my fears
I've become the kind of man I always hated
I am pulled apart, and my swollen heart
Has flipped out of the pan into the fire
I am in love insane with a sense of shame
That I threw stones at the condemned and
Now I'm slated

He has a vague memory of like before some fall
Behaving like a reptile, but talks of walking tall
If God is in his image, the Almighty must be small

After damning me and you to Hell for eternity

They bribe their way past Heaven's gates and steal a set of keys

I speak in the name of that White Haired

Dispensing lightening justice from His fingertips
Watching you every second of the day
Just waiting for you to fuck up

I'm His intermediary
I'm a Mollah, I'm a Priest, I'm a Vicar
If you want to go to God
You have to come through me
Because my God is bigger than your God
My God is bigger than your God
My God is the only way

Is Heaven full, oh Lord, of these babbling preachers
All these self-righteous, self-appointed prophets
Because if so, I know where I'd rather be

When they can hide their crimes in a legal disguise

Warning you
Or lock you away for a while without trial
And if an honest cop gets to close to the
Truth of it

And the gap between crack and thunder
Crack and thunder
Is closing in
Is closing in

And makes a great sound on concrete

On a flat roof, there's a boy
Leaning against a wall of rain
Aerial held high
Calling ""Come on thunder,
Come on thunder!""

And the rain lifts lids off cars
Spinning buses like toys
Stripping them to chrome
Across the bay, the waves are something else
Picking up fishing boats and spewing them on the shore

The boy's hit!
Lit up against the sky
Like a sign
Like a neon sign

Then he crumples
Drops into the gutter
Cut strings
Legs twitching

The flood swells his clothes
Delivers him on
Delivers him on

Puts my ear to his

So I brought myself a gun
The salesman called it freedom
So my enemy bought a bigger one

I'm saving up for a missile
That will shoot him up with love
Now his finger's on my button
And my hand is in his glove

What for, tell oh me, tell oh me, what for

The starling spiral dancing on air.

What for, tell oh me, tell oh me, what for

I will pass through the glass into air past those birds

If anybody ever had a heart, he wouldn't be alone
He knows, she's been here too few years to be gone

And we always say, it would be good to go away someday
But if there's nothing there to make things change
If it's the same for you I'll just hang

The trouble understand, is she got reasons he don't
Funny how he couldn't see it at all 'til she grabbed up her coat
And she goes, she's been here too few years to take it all in stride
But still it's much too long, to let hurt go (you let her go)

And we always say, it would be good to go away, someday
But if there's nothing there to make things change

Call what he does a sin if it makes you feel better

You have to come through me

Well behind their curtain

As they try to plug that leak
I am tempted by their cloak of secrecy
To find out what their games are about
Ask a question and they'll talk of secret services

When they can hide their crimes in a legal disguise
Truth will not be seen nor heard

Warning you
Or lock you away for a while without trial
And if an honest cop gets to close to the
Truth of it

Do they have the means to rewrite history
Wipe out the genes of doubt

Stripping them to chrome

Picking up fishing boats and spewing them on the shore

Lit up against the sky
Like a sign
Like a neon sign

Drops into the gutter
Cut strings

Delivers him on

Now if you put your ear close you'll be able to hear
Not the sea shore noise of the shore sea shell
The clatter of plates
And the bronze of the bell
Going ding dong, ding dong, ding dong dong

Going out of my mind as they hollow my head
I'm floating in the air, but my body's in bed
The more they eat, the more I see
What is not, but just could be
You can hear them laughing in my head
You can hear them laughing in my head
Ha ha ha ha ha

Now they've eaten my memory, I can't recall
How the world used to be before
So a vision is the same as what is real
Depends upon the lighting, and how I feel
Ding dong, drum drum, ha ha ha ha ha

And then the music stopped
The musician went away
They'd eaten all my brain
The red and the grey

They all stack at home
Dug a tongue through my nose
Where my brain used to be
Now there's only a hole

You'll be sure to find your answers, penetrate the scream in the cynics

Even my vision is impaired

I feel like Fred Astaire

Just met a girl who believes we can fly
I'm a bull, not a bear
I'm a millionaire

I feel like Fred Astaire

I believe in happiness
I believe in love
I believe she fell to earth
From somewhere high above
I believe in Hollywood
Don't believe that love must bring despair

'Cause when I hold her in my arms
I feel like Fred Astaire

You say love is just a disease
A plague for the naÃ¯ve
These days, no-one believes

Meteors may strike the earth
Nations live and die
I'm the boy who got the girl
And now we're gonna fly
We can cross the race divide
Bridge a gap that wasn't really there

Should have been a shooting star
Could have made it past the bar
Would have been a winner if I'd ever got that far

What a state I'm in

Here's another victim singing suffering

If only I had made the grade
Been more loved, been less afraid
If only I had scored the goal, got the girl or even played

What a state I'm in

Here's another victim singing suffering

Fall, let it fall away these lies
To be born again then fall
Let it fall away these lies
To be born again, to be born again

Loser sad and life's a bore
Can't see the point in living in this fashion anymore

That they wanted to join you but no they wouldn't undress
Oh there, that wetness, splashed their skin
So they prayed for a whirlpool to pull you in

That it was for you, but no it wasn't for them

While the wait of their fears pulled them underground
Will anyone learn from the stories that are told
Of the tribe who drown in a grave of gold

Depends upon the lighting, and how I feel

And women are a plaything that are just made for men

To impress all those, who so impressed me
And young boys melt into men
And we'll start the process again

The rain floods gutters, and makes a great sound on the concrete
On a flat roof, there's a boy leaning against the wall of rain 
Aerial held high, calling ""come on thunder, come on thunder""

Sometimes, when I look deep in your eyes, I swear I can see your soul
Sometimes, when I look deep in your eyes, I swear I can see your soul 

It's a monsoon, and the rain lifts lids off cars
Spinning buses like toys, stripping them to chrome
Across the bay, the waves are turning into something else
Picking up fishing boats and spewing them on the shore 

The boy is hit, lit up against the sky, like a sign, like a neon sign
And he crumples, drops into the gutter, legs twitching
The flood swells his clothes and delivers him on, delivers him on 

Sometimes, when I look deep in your eyes, I swear I can see your soul
Sometimes, when I look deep in your eyes, I swear I can see your soul 

There's four new colors in the rainbow
An old man's taking Polaroids
But all he captures is endless rain, endless rain 
He says listen, takes my head and puts my ear to his
And I swear I can hear the sea 

Sometimes, when I look in your eyes I can see your soul
(I can touch your soul )
(I can reach your soul)

To make do with a safer option
A breakthrough, two to one

And I pray I'm not tempting the fates

Everybody wants more money
Everybody wants more loving
Everybody wants the same things

I came across the border
Through the east and the west divide
The land between the trenches
Was patrolled by the deaf and the blind

The blind were shouting, ?Listen?
While the deaf said, ?Can't you see??
Somewhere deep in no man's land
The man has lost a key

I open up into this mystery
I have seen
I have seen
I have seen

There's centuries of fighting
So I brought myself a gun
The salesman called it freedom
So my enemy bought a bigger one

I'm saving up for a missile
That will shoot him up with love
Now his finger's on my button
And my hand is in his glove

I opened up into this mystery
Every key can lock you up or set you free
I believe that there is magic
In this mystery

Down the Mississippi toward the silver sea

I remember years ago
Someone told me I should take
Caution when it comes to love, I did

And you were strong and I was not
My illusion, my mistake
I was careless, I forgot, I did

And now
When all is done, there is nothing to say
You have gone and so effortlessly
You have won, you can go ahead tell them

Tell them all I know now
Shout it from the roof tops
Write it on the sky line
All we had is gone now

Tell them I was happy
And my heart is broken
All my scars are open
Tell them what I hoped would be impossible,
Impossible
Impossible
Impossible

Falling out of love is hard
Falling for betrayal is worse
Broken trust and broken hearts
I know, I know
And thinking all you need is there
Building faith on love and words
Empty promises will wear
I know
I know and now

When all is done, there is nothing to say
And if you're done with embarrassing me
On your own you can go ahead tell them

Tell them all I know now
Shout it from the roof tops
Write it on the sky line
All we had is gone now

Tell them I was happy
And my heart is broken
All my scars are open
Tell them what I hoped would be impossible,

I throw punches through these blurry eyes

Caution when it comes to love

I was careless, I forgot

And now when all is done

You have won
You can go ahead tell them

Tell them all I know now

Falling for betrayal is worst

James Arthur,"I met you in the dark, you lit me up
You made me feel as though I was enough
We danced the night away, we drank too much
I held your hair back when
You were throwing up

Then you smiled over your shoulder
For a minute, I was stone-cold sober
I pulled you closer to my chest
And you asked me to stay over
I said, I already told ya
I think that you should get some rest

I knew I loved you then
But you'd never know
'Cause I played it cool when I was scared of letting go
I know I needed you
But I never showed
But I wanna stay with you until we're grey and old
Just say you won't let go
Just say you won't let go

I'll wake you up with some breakfast in bed
I'll bring you coffee with a kiss on your head
And I'll take the kids to school
Wave them goodbye
And I'll thank my lucky stars for that night

When you looked over your shoulder
For a minute, I forget that I'm older
I wanna dance with you right now
Oh, and you look as beautiful as ever
And I swear that everyday you'll get better
You make me feel this way somehow

I'm so in love with you
And I hope you know
Darling your love is more than worth its weight in gold
We've come so far my dear
Look how we've grown
And I wanna stay with you until we're grey and old
Just say you won't let go
Just say you won't let go

I wanna live with you
Even when we're ghosts
'Cause you were always there for me when I needed you most

What if we rewrite the stars?
Say you were made to be mine
Nothing could keep us apart
You'll be the one I was meant to find
It's up to you and it's up to me

You think it's easy
You think I don't wanna grow onto you, yeah
But there are mountains (but there are mountains)
And there are doors that we can't walk through

How can you say you'll be mine?
Everything keeps us apart
And I'm not the one you were meant to find (the one you were meant to find)
It's not up to you, it's not up to me
When everyone tells us what we can be
And how come we rewrite the stars?

All I want is to fall with you

Take the money
Take it to the shops 
Where we can spend it all honey

And experience the genius of Terrence and Leonard
Send them victorious
Happy and glorious
Long to reign over us

The legend and the story of
Feather cropped and blow dried hair
Clever clogs and Lionel Blairs

Or is this your way to hide a broken heart?
Many dreams have been brought to your doorstep
They just lie there, and they die there
Are you warm, are you real Mona Lisa?

Crack and thunder, is closing in, is closing in

On a flat roof, there's a boy leaning against the wall of rain 
Aerial held high, calling ""come on thunder, come on thunder""

Sometimes, when I look deep in your eyes, I swear I can see your soul
Sometimes, when I look deep in your eyes, I swear I can see your soul

Spinning buses like toys, stripping them to chrome
Across the bay, the waves are turning into something else
Picking up fishing boats and spewing them on the shore 

The boy is hit, lit up against the sky, like a sign, like a neon sign
And he crumples, drops into the gutter, legs twitching
The flood swells his clothes and delivers him on, delivers him on

But all he captures is endless rain, endless rain

Su una vecchia terrazza davanti al golfo di Surriento

Te voglio bene assaie ma tanto bene sai
É una catena ormai che scioglie il sangue dint'e vene sai

Vide le luci in mezzo al mare pensò alle notti lá in America
Ma erano solo le lampare e la bianca scia di un'elica
Sentì il dolore nella musica si alzò dal pianoforte
Ma quando vide la luna uscire da un nuvola
Gli sembrò più dolce anche la morte
Guardò negli occhi la ragazza quegli occhi verdi come il mare
Poi all'improvviso uscì una lacrima e lui credette di affogare

Te voglio bene assaie, ma tanto tanto bene sai
È una catena ormai che scioglie il sangue dint'e vene, sai

Potenza della lirica, dove ogni dramma è un falso
Che con un po' di trucco e con la mimica puoi diventare un altro
Ma due occhi che ti guardano così vicini e veri
Ti fan scordare le parole confondono i pensieri
Così diventa tutto piccolo anche le nottie là in America
Ti volti e vedi la tua vita come là scia di un'elica
Ma si è la vita che finisce ma lui non ci pensò poi tanto
Anzi si sentiva già felice e ricominciò il suo canto

Is a bridge made to my past

Shadows bring everything back in soft light
I wouldn't change yesterday not in my life
And so, I live in a house of no regrets

Corridors that wind, through time, never end
They are journeys made to be

Sends me shivers
Like the first time
Stairways I climb to the heights

I watch you on the red horizon

Will protect you under stormy skies

With your face sketched on it twice
Oh you're in my blood like holy wine
You taste so bitter and so sweet

Oh I could drink a case of you darling
Still I'd be on my feet
Oh I would still be on my feet

Oh I am a lonely painter
I live in a box of paints
I'm frightened by the devil
And I'm drawn to those ones that ain't afraid

I remember that time you told me you said
""Love is touching souls""
Surely you touched mine
'Cause part of you pours out of me
In these lines from time to time
Oh, you're in my blood like holy wine
You taste so bitter and so sweet

Oh I could drink a case of you darling
And I would still be on my feet
I would still be on my feet

I met a woman
She had a mouth like yours
She knew your life
She knew your devils and your deeds
And she said,
""Go to him, stay with him if you can
But be prepared to bleed""

Oh but you are in my blood
You're my holy wine
You're so bitter, bitter and so sweet

Oh, I could drink a case of you darling
Still I'd be on my feet
I would still be on my feet",A Case of You,2011
