Kacie Sheik,"Welcome, sulfur dioxide
Hello, carbon monoxide
The air, the air is everywhere
Breathe deep, while you sleep, breathe deep

Bless you, alcohol bloodstream
Save me nicotine lung steam
Incense, incense is in the air
Breathe deep, while you sleep, breathe deep

Cataclysmic, ectoplasm
Fall out, atomic orgasm
Vapor and fume at the stone of my tomb
Breathing like a solemn perfume
Eating at the stone of my tomb

I'm looking rather attractive
Now that I'm radioactive
Just watch me spark
I glow in the dark!

She glows in the dark

Breathe deep, while you sleep, breathe deep

Deep, deep, deep, deep, deep",Air,
Kacy,"There were Seven Yellow Gypsies
All in a row
None of them lame or lazy oh
And they sang so neat and so complete
That they stole the heart of the lady oh

It was late at night when the lord came home
Enquiring for his lady oh
I’m afraid I’m afraid said the old kitchen maid
She’s gone away with seven yellow gypsies oh

So saddle me up my bonny black horse
The white ones n'er so speedy oh
And how we'll ride in the long summer night
In search of my false lady oh

So, he rode west and he rode best
He rode the woods and coolies-o
Until he came to an open field
There he found his lady oh

Would you give up your house and land?
Would you give your baby oh?
Would you give up your new wedded lord?
And go away with the seven yellow gypsies oh

Oh what do I care for my house and land?
What care I for my baby oh?
Sure I wouldn’t give a kiss from a gypsy's laddie's lips
For Lord Cassillis' money oh

There were Seven Yellow Gypsies
All in a row
None of them lame or lazy oh
And they sang so neat and so complete
That they stole the heart of the lady oh",Seven Yellow Gypsies,2015
Kacy Crowley,"I tear into my clothes
Sacrifice my soul for anything, anything
I gotta clear this town
No sense in hanging around
Cause anything anything anything
Is better than this

Where can the action be
To fill this need in me
Cause anything anything anything
Is better than this

I am the wicked boy
Who takes your favourute toy
Or anything anything
You show me someone
Who doesn't want no fun

What you see in me anything
I can take alot
I'll just take a shot at anything
What you got

I'll make my girl scream
I'll be her love machine anywhere

Anyway
She only wants my tricks
But we do have our kicks
At anything anything
Is better than this

Kacy Crowley,"Across the river we all had dreams
They got caught up in little puddle upstreams
Melting down to the very cold
Just thank God there's always a little more

We moved to cities to separate
We end up smashed together anyways
And every color and every shape
We're all mixed up just like Lauren

Hate

And you can say that things that change
But in the mirror I 'ways look the same
In between high and low
Takes the few things that we know
Just to balance where to go

We stand on platforms and wait for trains
Some double doger will have worldly pains
We are never sure which one of us is moving now ahead

You can say that things that change
But in the mirror I always look the same
In between the high and low
Takes the few things that we know
Just to balance where to go

My eyes close with my place wide open
My breath it stops on a dime

I call my mother though we don't go along
Because when I was there she was cold and furious
One last thing I need to get a handle of
People can love you, still do you wrong

You can say that things that change
But in the mirror I always look the same
In between the high and low
Takes the few things that we know
Just to balance where to go

Baby, just to balance

",Vertigo,1997
Kacy Hill,"You come and go and you'll stay as you please
Convinced a moment's time is all that I need
These temporary highs can't make me believe
That your feelings are true

Holding out your hand
While you turn your head
I don't want half of your love
Empty words you've said
Bare unraveled thread
You know it's never enough

You can't love me this way
You can't keep me in chains
You can't lead me astray
From an arm's length away

You search for breathing space while I'm undersea
Tell me to wait so you can sort through your needs
Keep leaving trails that you’ll follow to me
I can't let you get through
 
Holding out your hand
While you turn your head
I don't want half of your love
Empty words you’ve said
Bare unraveled thread
You know it’s never enough

You can't love me this way
You can't keep me in chains
You can't lead me astray
From an arm's length away

Your absence won't define me now
Held up my end with breath I've found
Surrendered time to solid ground, solid ground

You can't love me this way
You can't keep me in chains
You can't lead me astray
From an arm's length away
You can't love me this way

50 on her chain, 'nother 50 on her caddy, oh

Pop anything, pop anything that find an alley

I'm worried you'll forget about me""
I'm falling in and out of cars, don't worry, I'mma get it, granny
What happened to my daddy, happy mama called me up
That money coming and she love me, I done made it now
I done found life's meaning now, all them days of heartbreak
Her heart out of pieces now, friends turning into fraud niggas
Practicing, have the passion, you niggas packaged different
All you niggas, you niggas want, that's why you can't have it
I'mma sell it, you niggas salary 'bout to cabbage
Youngest nigga outta Houston at the Grammys

All of this off of rapping, should've wrote this in Latin

I know, I know, I know, I know, I know
Cuzzo said we in the store, yeah, we 'bout to drop a 4
He pass the cigarette, I choke
Tell my auntie put them poles down, them poles down
Now you know you love your own now
Hit the stage, they got their hands up, don't put your nose down
I ain't knockin' a nigga, I knocked the door down, for sure now
Hardcore, I swear they counting on me
Gold chains, gold rings, I got an island on me
Houses on me, he got them ounces on him
Holy father, come save these niggas, I'm styling on 'em

Disguising clouds as cooler, grey sunshine
There's no surreal emotion
In swimming open oceans

Stripped down from all that's holy
With narcoleptic hoping
It's okay to look straight
Without naive impulsions

Tonight
I'm fine
I'm clean
Not blind

It's temporary, resolving to rewind
Consuming silence 'til sound gives up the fight
Can't waste my nights on hoping
The world will give in slowly
It's temporary, these catatonic lights

Stripped down from all that's holy
With narcoleptic hoping
It's okay to look straight
Without naive impulsions

Tonight

Watching the tides spill in with wine

Feel like I was split down the middle of my heart
Don't know if you noticed
But there's a hole in the middle, a dark star
And I remember the way your rain hit me there
Hit me so hard
I'll never be the same again

And they say it's never as deep as the first time

We want the fame
C'mon (C'mon) 

One thing we all adore 
Something worth dying for 
Nothing but pain 
Stuck in this game 
Searching for fortune and fame 

The one thing we all adore 
Something worth dying for 
It's been nothing but pain 
Stuck in this game 
Searching for fortune and fame 

Though we exist and breathe some believe currency comes to G's 
Stresses after battle with success comes greed (echo) 
They got me hot When they shot me 
Plotted my revenge 
To increase my ends 
Enemies gettin' dropped 
Win or lose 
Red or blue 
We must all stay true 
Play the game nigga 
Never let the game play you 
And for the fame 
Niggas change fast 
That's a shame 
What's the game 
Lost souls 
Who controls our brain? 
Who can I blame? 
The world seems strange at times 
Somewhat insane 
I'm hoping we can change with time 
I'm living blinded 
Searching for refinement 
Curse, I know death follows me 
But I murder him first 
And worse yet 
With each breathe 
Steps I take 
Breathless 
Is there a cure for a hustler with a death wish? 
Cigar ashes 
Coaster 
Crystal glasses 
We mash on them jealous bastards 
With a ski mask 
I'm the first one to warn them 
Blast it 
Wrapped in plastic 
Bullshitting got his ass hit (outlaws) 
Ain't nothing left now 
Treated like a stepchild 
Was not for me 
Nothing but busters and bitches (fuck 'em all) 
Be rocking beats 
Fake in fame 

Block run and shoot slugs 
We throw them back like hardballs 
Without the gloves 
No love for these fake desperados 
And thugs I bleed to envy 
Smoke and blow out they blunts 
Sipping Henney 
Drunk nights 
And hot days 
Cocking my heat shooting it sideways 
A wife on the run 
Full of common blunts 
Unconditionally married 
To my gun 
Fulfillin' my destiny 
On knees 
And ones desires 
Be pulling all my cabbage like priors 
Stuck in the trance searching for something higher

A lose of the game 
With life the cost of the game 
We forcing the change 
Mother fuck flossing the chain  
All the blame 
Belongs to the part of the brain (
That we never use nigga 
Plus my heart is in pain 
And if I ever lose homey 
Bet I'm at it again 
Outlaws don't die 
So united we stand 
And if family come before 
All the fortune and fame 
 
As I walk up in the crib 
Laid to rest my head 
Say some rhymes to angels 
Hope they bless my bed 
Hope they bless me the righteous way 
Got a homie locked down 
Outta town 
I sent him a kite today 
Man that hate in your heart you gotta cleanse it dog 
Praying for my downfall and I can sense it dog 
I was passed down the street fame 
Like glock clocked and keep aim 
Was raised up with a clock box 
And I ran with the local street gang 
They say the light is faded 
But still shine in the dark 
You can easy been a man 
But you is a boy in your heart 
And that's some game that I got 
From generation of game 
In the road of life dog 
We need to switch up lanes 
Think about it

I can't complain 
I've seen my fair share of the fame 
It won't change me 
Now I've got this piece of change 
I feel strange I got so used to the hood 
That when I finally got out at first it ain't feel good 
I was just a baby still retarded from slavery 
When we struggle to shovel shit ain't nobody saved me 
Ghetto ain't made me I made myself 
Poverty raised me thinking ain't no help 
I pray for my health my mind and my family too 
State of myself my grind and my family crew 
Where one hand watches the other 
No we ain't blood 
But we still real brothers 
The struggle is real 
Nothing can steal 
What we build 
And that remains the same 
'Till that day we killed 
And that's real 
Life that I was aimed to be 
Love by my family tree 
That's fame to me 
How about it

Will I love her or shall I diss her?

Tryin' to paint a perfect picture
My memories of jealousy no longer carefree

A lil', trick on a mission tryin' to get in my P's
Me and my niggas is thug niggas, former known drug dealers

Watchin' our own downfall, witness the end
It's like we don't believe in God 'cause we livin' in sin
I asked my homie on the block why he strapped, he laughed
Pointed his pistol as the cop car passed and blast
It's just another murder, nobody mourns no more
My tear drops gettin' bigger but can't figure what I'm cryin' for
Is it the miniature caskets, little babies
Victims of a stray, from drug dealers gone crazy
Maybe it's just the drugs, visions of how the block was
Crack came and it was strange how it rocked us
Perhaps the underlyin' fact stay high explain genocide
It's when we ride on our own kind
What is it we all fear, reflections in the mirror
We can't escape fate, the end is gettin' nearer

Times of Armageddon, murder in mass amounts
In this society where only gettin' the cash counts
I started out as a beginner
Entered the criminal lifestyle became a sinner
I make my money and vacate, evade prison
Went from the chosen one to outcast, unforgiven
And all the Hennessey and weed can't hide, the pain I feel inside
You know, it's like I'm livin' just to die
I fall on my knees and beg for mercy, not knowin' if I'm worthy
Livin' life thinkin' no man can hurt me
So I'm askin', before I lay me down to sleep

Something worth dying for 
Nothing but pain 
Stuck in this game 
Searching for fortune and fame 

The one thing we all adore 
Something worth dying for 
It's been nothing but pain 
Stuck in this game 
Searching for fortune and fame 

Though we exist and breathe some believe currency comes to G's 
Stresses after battle with success comes greed (echo) 
They got me hot When they shot me 
Plotted my revenge 
To increase my ends 
Enemies gettin' dropped 
Win or lose 
Red or blue 
We must all stay true 
Play the game nigga 
Never let the game play you 
And for the fame 
Niggas change fast 
That's a shame 
What's the game 
Lost souls 
Who controls our brain? 
Who can I blame? 
The world seems strange at times 
Somewhat insane 
I'm hoping we can change with time 
I'm living blinded 
Searching for refinement 
Curse, I know death follows me 
But I murder him first 
And worse yet 
With each breathe 
Steps I take 
Breathless 
Is there a cure for a hustler with a death wish? 
Cigar ashes 
Coaster 
Crystal glasses 
We mash on them jealous bastards 
With a ski mask 
I'm the first one to warn them 
Blast it 
Wrapped in plastic 
Bullshitting got his ass hit (outlaws) 
Ain't nothing left now 
Treated like a stepchild 
Was not for me 
Nothing but busters and bitches (fuck 'em all) 
Be rocking beats 
Fake in fame 

Block run and shoot slugs 
We throw them back like hardballs 
Without the gloves 
No love for these fake desperados 
And thugs I bleed to envy 
Smoke and blow out they blunts 
Sipping Henney 
Drunk nights 
And hot days 
Cocking my heat shooting it sideways 
A wife on the run 
Full of common blunts 
Unconditionally married 
To my gun 
Fulfillin' my destiny 
On knees 
And ones desires 
Be pulling all my cabbage like priors

A lose of the game 
With life the cost of the game 
We forcing the change 
Mother fuck flossing the chain  
All the blame 
Belongs to the part of the brain (
That we never use nigga 
Plus my heart is in pain 
And if I ever lose homey 
Bet I'm at it again 
Outlaws don't die 
So united we stand 
And if family come before 
All the fortune and fame 
 
As I walk up in the crib 
Laid to rest my head 
Say some rhymes to angels 
Hope they bless my bed 
Hope they bless me the righteous way 
Got a homie locked down 
Outta town 
I sent him a kite today 
Man that hate in your heart you gotta cleanse it dog 
Praying for my downfall and I can sense it dog 
I was passed down the street fame 
Like glock clocked and keep aim 
Was raised up with a clock box 
And I ran with the local street gang 
They say the light is faded 
But still shine in the dark 
You can easy been a man 
But you is a boy in your heart 
And that's some game that I got 
From generation of game 
In the road of life dog 
We need to switch up lanes

I can't complain 
I've seen my fair share of the fame 
It won't change me 
Now I've got this piece of change 
I feel strange I got so used to the hood 
That when I finally got out at first it ain't feel good 
I was just a baby still retarded from slavery 
When we struggle to shovel shit ain't nobody saved me 
Ghetto ain't made me I made myself 
Poverty raised me thinking ain't no help 
I pray for my health my mind and my family too 
State of myself my grind and my family crew 
Where one hand watches the other 
No we ain't blood 
But we still real brothers 
The struggle is real 
Nothing can steal 
What we build 
And that remains the same 
'Till that day we killed 
And that's real 
Life that I was aimed to be 
Love by my family tree 
That's fame to me 
How about it

Tryin' to paint a perfect picture
My memories of jealousy no longer carefree

When you all up in that, you so smooth with it
That's why I never hesitate to say ""daddy come and get it""

Our sex attractive like metal to a magnet
Turn that T.I. On, that's her shit right there
Get drunk, now she hollering, ""that's her dick right there""

And showed him how to make a missile and snap a bone tissue
Red covered the floors, only by the doors
Incase the d.e.a. got a drug sweep tour
To feed the kanine, look, I keep one on your waistline
A few thoughts if they really wanna chase mine
Why they wanna replace mine, chance with the killer when I chase mine
I wear bullet proof transform, leave a number on who made mine
Smoking that gray pine, they save mine
I had to seek it, now I'm one of the ones that can speak it

All of nature wild and free
This is where I long to be

And when the samba played
The sun would set so high
Ring through my ears and sting my eyes

Warm wind carried on the sea, he called to me
Te dijo te amo
I prayed that the days would last
They went so fast

Unmet, she comes back as a cat
A wise man once told me that reincarnation
Is common in cases like that

Like Sei Shonagon I was once a good lady
And you were my lover back when
Your Samurai relatives ruled Kamakura
I wish you'd had time for me then

You were too busy hunting, or watching the wrestling
Learning to fence andto ride
You left me with servants who made me look beautiful
Just in case you changed your mind

So don't be surprised, love, if one rainy evening
A meowing awakens your bed(?)
And cat that's a ghost that can visit the past
Comes pushing it's nose through your gate

Don't be afraid of a cat from the future
Somebody built a machine
Allowing the cat to go centuries back
Through an electronic catflap in time

Don't be afraid if I seem supernatural
One of us died long ago
I don't mean to scare you, I needn't stay
I just wanted to tell you hello

In the future the miceare wiped out by a virus
Pollution obscures the full moon
Human beings live in cages
They've built in the sky
The tea rooms and temples are gone

Cats are just guinea pigs
People are astronauts
Love is as cold as the snow
People shoot moon rockets into the past
It's the last unspoiled place left to go

You're world has perished
But sometimes I miss you
And come slinking back to the past
In search of affection the future can't give me
Because it's too cold and too fast

",De Colores,1986
Kahn,"When I was a little girl I wished I was a boy
I tagged along behind the gang and wore my corduroys.
Everybody said I only did it to annoy
But I was gonna be an engineer.

Mamma said, ""Why can't you be a lady?
Your duty is to make me the mother of a pearl
Wait until you're older, dear
And maybe you'll be glad that you're a girl.

Dainty as a Dresden statue, gentle as a Jersey cow,
Smooth as silk, gives cream and milk
Learn to coo, learn to moo
That's what you do to be a lady, now.

When I went to school I learned to write and how to read
History, geography and home economy
And typing is a skill that every girl is sure to need
To while away the extra time until the time to breed
And then they had the nerve to ask, what would I like to be?
I says, ""I'm gonna be an engineer!""

""No, you only need to learn to be a lady
The duty isn't yours, for to try to run the world
An engineer could never have a baby
Remember, dear, that you're a girl""

She's smart, for a woman.
I wonder how she got that way?
You get no choice, you get no voice
Just stay mum, pretend you're dumb.
That's how you come to be a lady, today.

Well, I started as a typist but I studied on the sly
Working out the day and night so I could qualify
And every time the boss came in, he pinched me on the thigh
Said, ""I've never had an engineer!""
""You owe it to the job to be a lady
The duty of the staff is to give the boss a whirl
The wages that you get are crummy, maybe
But it's all you get, 'cause you're a girl""

Then Jimmy came along and we set up a conjugation
We were busy every night with loving recreation
I spent my days at work so he could get an education
And now he's an engineer!

He said: ""I know you'll always be a lady
The duty of my darling is to love me all her life
Could an engineer look after or obey me?
Remember, dear, that you're my wife!""

As soon a Jimmy got a job, I studied hard again
Then busy at me turret-lathe a year or two, and then
The morning that the twins were born, Jimmy says to them
""Your mother was an engineer!""
""You owe it to the kids to be a lady
Dainty as a dish-rag, faithful as a chow
Stay at home, you got to mind the baby
Remember you're a mother now!""

Every time I turn around there's something else to do
Cook a meal or mend a sock or sweep a floor or two
Listening to Jimmy Young, it makes me want to spew
I was gonna be an engineer.

I only wish that I could be a lady
I'd do the lovely things that a lady's supposed to do
I wouldn't even mind if only they would pay me
Then I could be a person too.

What price for a woman?
You can buy her for a ring of gold,
To love and obey, without any pay,
You get a cook and a nurse for better or worse
You don't need a purse when a lady is sold.

Oh, but now the times are harder and me Jimmy's got the sack;
I went down to Vicker's, they were glad to have me back.
But I'm a third-class citizen, my wages tell me that
But I'm a first-class engineer!

The boss he says ""We pay you as a lady,
You only got the job because I can't afford a man,
With you I keep the profits high as may be,
You're just a cheaper pair of hands.""

You got one fault, you're a woman
You're not worth the equal pay.
A bitch or a tart, you're nothing but heart,
Shallow and vain, you've got no brain,

Well, I listened to my mother and I joined a typing pool
Listened to my lover and I put him through his school
If I listen to the boss, I'm just a bloody fool
And an underpaid engineer
I been a sucker ever since I was a baby
As a daughter, as a mother, as a lover, as a dear
But I'll fight them as a woman, not a lady
I'll fight them as an engineer!",I'm Gonna Be an Engineer,1986
Kahn,"I dreamed I saw Joe Hill last night,
Alive as you and me.
Says I ""But Joe, you're ten years dead""
""I never died"" said he,
""I never died"" said he.

""The Copper Bosses killed you Joe,
They shot you Joe"" says I.
""Takes more than guns to kill a man""
Says Joe ""I didn't die""
Says Joe ""I didn't die""

""In Salt Lake City, Joe,"" says I, 
Him standing by my bed, 
""They framed you on a murder charge,"" 
Says Joe, ""But I ain't dead,"" 
Says Joe, ""But I ain't dead."" 

And standing there as big as life
And smiling with his eyes.
Says Joe ""What they can never kill
Went on to organize,
Went on to organize""

From San Diego up to Maine,
In every mine and mill,
Where working men defend their rights,
It's there you'll find Joe Hill,
It's there you'll find Joe Hill!

Alive as you and me.

Kahn,"John Henry was about three days old,
Sittin' on his papa's knee.
He picked up a hammer and a little piece of steel;
Said, ""Hammer's gonna be the death of me, Lord, Lord.
Hammer's gonna be the death of me.""
The captain said to John Henry
""Gonna bring that steam drill 'round.
Gonna bring that steam drill out on the job.
Gonna whop that steel on down. Down,
Down.
Whop that steel on down.""
John Henry told his captain,
""A man ain't nothin' but a man,
But before I let your steam drill beat me
Down,
I'd die with a hammer in my hand. Lord,
Lord.
I'd dies with a hammer in my hand.""
John Henry said to his shaker,
""Shaker, why don't you sing?
I'm throwin' thirty pounds from my hips on
Down.
Just listen to that cold steel ring. Lord, Lord.
Listen to that cold steel ring.""
The man that invented the stream drill
Thought he was mighty fine,
But John Henry made fifteen feet;
The steam drill only made nine. Lord, Lord.
The steam drill only made nine.
John Henry hammered in the mountain
His hammer was striking fire.
But he worked so hard, he broke his poor heart.
He laid down his hammer and he died. Lord, Lord.
He laid down his hammer and he died.
John Henry had a little woman.
Her name was Polly Ann.
John Henry took sick and went to his bed.
Polly Ann drove steel like a man. Lord, Lord.
Polly Ann drove steel like a man.
John Henry had a little baby.
You could hold him in the palm of your hand.
The last words I heard that poor boy say,
""My daddy was steel-driving man. Lord, Lord.
My daddy was a steel-driving.""
Well, every Monday morning
When the bluebirds begin to sing.
You can hear John Henry a mile or more.
You can hear John Henry's hammer ring.
Lord, Lord.
You can hear John Henry's hammer ring.",John Henry,1986
Kahn,"Now, if you want higher wages let me tell you what to do
You got to talk to the workers in the shop with you.
You got to build you a union, got to make it strong,
But if you all stick together, boys, it won't be long.
You get shorter hours, better working conditions,
Vacations with pay. Take your kids to the seashore.

It ain't quite this simple, so I better explain
Just why you got to ride on the union train.
'Cause if you wait for the boss to raise your pay,
We'll all be a-waitin' 'til Judgment Day.
We'll all be buried, gone to heaven,
St. Peter'll be the straw boss then.

Now you know you're underpaid but the boss says you ain't;
He speeds up the work 'til you're 'bout to faint.
You may be down and out, but you ain't beaten,
You can pass out a leaflet and call a meetin'.
Talk it over, speak your mind,
Decide to do somethin' about it.

Course, the boss may persuade some poor damn fool
To go to your meetin' and act like a stool.
But you can always tell a stool, though, that's a fact,
He's got a yaller streak a-runnin' down his back.
He doesn't have to stool, he'll always get along
On what he takes out of blind men's cups.

You got a union now, and you're sittin' pretty,
Put some of the boys on the steering committee.
The boss won't listen when one guy squawks,
But he's got to listen when the union talks.
He'd better, be mighty lonely
Everybody decide to walk out on him.

Suppose they're working you so hard it's just outrageous
And they're paying you all starvation wages.
You go to the boss and the boss would yell,
""Before I raise your pay I'd see you all in hell.""
Well, he's puffing a big seegar, feeling mighty slick
'Cause he thinks he's got your union licked.
Well, he looks out the window and what does he see
But a thousand pickets, and they all agree:
He's a bastard, unfair, slavedriver,
Bet he beats his wife!

Now, boys, you've come to the hardest time.
The boss will try to bust your picket line.
He'll call out the police, the National Guard,
They'll tell you it's a crime to have a union card.
They'll raid your meetin', they'll hit you on the head,
They'll call every one of you a goddam red,
Unpatriotic, Japanese spies, sabotaging national defense!

But out at Ford, here's what they found,
And out at Vultee, here's what they found,
And out at Allis-Chalmers, here's what they found,
And down at Bethlehem, here's what they found:
That if you don't let red-baiting break you up,
And if you don't let stoolpigeons break you up,
And if you don't let vigilantes break you up,
And if you don't let race hatred break you up,
You'll win. What I mean, take it easy, but take it!",Talking Union,1986
Kahn,"There once was a union maid, she never was afraid
Of goons and ginks and company finks and the deputy sheriffs who made the raid.
She went to the union hall when a meeting it was called,
And when the Legion boys come 'round
She always stood her ground.

Oh, you can't scare me, I'm sticking to the union,
I'm sticking to the union, I'm sticking to the union.
Oh, you can't scare me, I'm sticking to the union,
I'm sticking to the union 'til the day I die.

This union maid was wise to the tricks of company spies,
She couldn't be fooled by a company stool, she'd always organize the guys.
She always got her way when she struck for better pay.
She'd show her card to the National Guard
And this is what she'd say

You gals who want to be free, just take a tip from me;
Get you a man who's a union man and join the ladies' auxiliary.
Married life ain't hard when you got a union card,
A union man has a happy life when he's got a union wife.

The shadows outline that you're right on time for the very first time...
You can't conceal that look, 
The one I couldn't ignore,
Your look this evening was meant to deny...
The black and white's on the wall,
Our future there in Doisneau,
My pocket is heavy with diamonds tonight...
But they won't shine on your hand,
And what I thought were our plans flicker out with goodbye...

Am I the last to know?

Your eyes are cold but my tears are warm,
Why do people like you hurt people like me?
You blind your fear with your pride, 
Protect the woman inside,
I know you know how true it can be...
But you're afraid of the need, 
Can't risk the imminent bleed,
What is love but the greatest of dangers...
And now the songs are a lie,
I never dreamed you would cry in a bed of a stranger...

Am I the last to know?

And in the shuddered rush, I will fall...
And in the tumbling I see it all...
A hushed release of you, and I'm free, and alive, and my heart, is the
Last...

Am I the Last to know?

Kai,"Tonight we're all alone tonight 
There's never been a moment 
That trembled like tonight 
I read your eyes tonight 

I see a love I've always known from another time 
That once again is mine I need to know 
Are you real? 
Do you feel the way I feel? 

Could you love like I love you? 
Say you can and say you do 

Say you'll stay say you're sure 
Say my heart was made for yours 
Let our love lead the way 
Say you'll stay 

Tonight, I've waited for tonight 
I've waited all my life to be here where we are 
With you here in my arms 
I can't believe, how you shine 

Is this moment really mine? 
Could you love, like I love you? 
Say you can and say you do 

[Chorus]
Say you'll stay, by my side 
Say it's more than just tonight 
Say our love, would never let you walk away (never walk away) 
Say you'll stay, say you're sure 
Say my heart was made for yours 
Let our love, lead the way 
Say you'll stay (say you'll stay) 

Say you'll stay 
Forever in my arms 
And whenever tears are falling 
Girl, I'll kiss them all away 
So if you want to be my lady, say you'll stay

Kai,"Count on the rain 
It's gonna fall 
There will be days 
When you'll wonder 
If you can keep holding on 
And as hard as you'll try 
There will be nights 
When you'll feel like 
You're gonna break down and cry 

Alone and in need 
If you say a prayer 
And reach out to me 

[Chorus]
I will be here 
Right by your side 
Count on my love 
Everyday of your life 
I will be here 
Pulling you through 
Count on me loving you 

Count on a dream 
Falling apart 
There will be times 
When you'll feel 
The whole world is 
Breaking your heart 

And when you're afraid 
If you close your eyes 
And call out my name

And through all the pain 
You can count on my love

Was it the love I failed to show 
Oh how I hate to see you crying 
Can someone tell us why we're here 
Caught between words and pain and fear 
So won't you come closer 
Because I'm dying for your love 

The way back home can be so hard 
I know we'll make it if we're heart to heart 
And if we give love everyday 
I know we'll make it if we're heart to heart, to heart

Did I forget to show you that you are my everything

I know we'll make it if we're heart to heart 
And if we give love everyday 
I know we'll make it if we're heart

And transcend the boundaries to reality
For caution to the wind be free
Unleash the strength within to dare

Express your hidden passion
Express your hidden passion

Express your hidden passion here and now
Dancing free, a soul without fear
No need to hide or be ashamed
Craps your chance release your passion now

The walls of inhibition crumble
Past shadows fade and light prevails
Like the phoenix from the ashes you have risen
Live life to the fullest while other stumble

How long has this been going on?

There were chills up my spine,
And some thrills I can't define.
Listen, sweet, I repeat,
How long has this been going on?

Oh, I feel that I could melt,
Into Heaven I'm hurled!
I know how Columbus felt,
Finding another world.

Kiss me once, then once more.
What a dunce I was before.
What a break! 
For Heaven's sake!
How long has this been going on?

Dear, when in your arms I creep,
That divine rendezvous,
Don't wake me, if I'm asleep,
Let me dream that it's true!

Kiss me twice, then once more.
That makes thrice, let's make it four!
What a break! 
For Heaven's sake!

Kai Winding,"I don't believe in frettin' and grievin',
Why mess around with strife?
I never was cut out to step and strut out.
Give me the simple life.

Some find it pleasant dining on pheasant.
Those things roll off my knife,
Just serve me tomatoes, and mashed potatoes,
Give me the simple life.

A cottage small is all I'm after,
Not one that's spacious and wide.
A house that rings with joy and laughter
And the ones you love inside.

Free from the care and strife.

From some enchanted land.

In the church where a wedding has been
Lives in a dream

Where do they all come from?

Where do they all belong?

Kai Winding,"To lead a better life
I need my love to be here

Here, making each day of the year
Changing my life with a wave of her hand
Nobody can deny that there's something there
There, running my hands through her hair
Both of us thinking how good it can be
Someone is speaking, but she doesn't know he's there

[Chorus: x2]
I want her everywhere
And if she's beside me I know I need never care
But to love her is to need her everywhere
Knowing that love is to share
Each one believing that love never dies
Watching her eyes and hoping I'm always there

I will be there
And everywhere
Here, there and everywhere","Here, There and Everywhere",1967
Kai Winding,"It begins to tell
'Round midnight, midnight
I do pretty well, till after sundown
Suppertime I'm feelin' sad

'Round midnight

Memories always start 'round midnight
Haven't got the heart to stand those memories
When my heart is still with you
And ol' midnight knows it, too
When a quarrel we had needs mending
Does it mean that our love is ending
Darlin' I need you, lately I find
You're out of my heart
And I'm out of my mind

Let our hearts take wings'

Until I'm almost mad
I must have 'roused the devil's wrath

I guess I'll go through life 
Just catchin' colds and missin' trains

Everything happens to me
I never miss a thing
I've had the measles and the mumps
And every time I play an ace
My partner always trumps
Guess I'm just a fool who never looks before he jumps

Everything happens to me
At first my heart thought you could break this jinx for me
That love would turn the trick to end despair
But know I just can't fool this head that thinks for me
I've mortgaged all my castles in the air
I've telegraphed and phoned
I send an 'Airmail Special' too
Your answer was 'Goodbye'

I'd give my soul just to call you my own
Got a moon above me
But no one to love me
Lover man, oh, where can you be? 

I've heard it said
That the thrill of romance
Can be like a heavenly dream
I go to bed with a prayer
That you'll make love to me
Strange as it seems

Someday we'll meet
And you'll dry all my tears

Bring all of your fam'ly and I will bring mine
If I should bring my brothers, and you bring the others
Then I can sing a song like Jeru, just for you

Just for all the lovely people that you see in the road
We'll sing them a song in Jeruvian mode
If I can have a pref'rence, I'll even make ref'rence
To why you write a song like Jeru, just for you

Then if you'd be kind enough to tell me why you
write these extended bridges
can it be romance that always
haunts me in my reverie?

So why not come on over 'bout a quarter to eight
If you can come early I'll never be late
And now you're all invited, I hope you're delighted
To sing a little song like Jeru, just for you
just for me too

Gather around, tale to be told
Maybe it's new, maybe it's old, listen my friend

Blowin' away, doin' alright
Plain' all day, workin' all night, listen again

Movin' along, coverin' ground
Singin' the song, lovin' the sound, listen and then

blow together birds of a feather
Out playin' the blues and ""I Got Rhythm""
All at once a moment came without a warning
Got so hot we had to cool it

Go for glory, tell you the story
Out payin' our dues until we found we were
assisting at an unexpected borning
'twas the birth of the Cool

So now I can tell you why I'm always
Trying to tell you, listen, come with me,
New York, and we're together in my reverie

So why don't you come over 'bout a quarter to two
Forget all the others, just me and just you
And while we're versifying
We'd better start trying
To write another song just for me
Just for you, one more Jeru",Jeru,1988
Kai Winding,"You went away
I let you
We broke the ties that bind

And high above
The moon was new
And so was love
This eager heart of mine was singing
Lover where can you be

You came at last
Love had its day
That day is past
You've gone away

Always hear when you sigh

Bill and coo when they love?
That's the kind of magic 
Music we make with our lips when we kiss

He really knows how to cry
That's how I'd cry in my pillow

I concentrate on you.

On your smile so sweet, so tender,
When at first your kiss I decline.
On the light in your eyes when I surrender,

Kaija Koo,"Hei, ei ei, en sitä salaa,
Näillä teillä loppuun palaa,
Tinakenkäni on sulaa laavaa.

Hän katselee rauhattomana itään,
Tuo tyttö hentoinen tinakengissään.
Kuuluuko sieltä suunnalta ketään,
Joka voisi ottaa tytön reppuselkään?

Hän on piirtänyt viestin karttaan, siellä lukee
Vie minut turvaan.

Ehkä hänet on luotu lentämään,
Ettei sulata tie hänen kenkiään

Hei, ei ei, en sitä salaa,
Näillä teillä loppuun palaa,
Tinakenkäni on sulaa laavaa.

Tule, tule siis ennen aamua
Et täältä muuten enää löydä mua
Kun aurinko nousee on pakko liikkua

Hän muistaa kuinka koulussa naurettiin,
Kun hän oli toisenlainen kuin kaikki muut.
Ja unissaan hän palaa pulpettiin,
Ja tinasotilasarmeija tukkii toisten suut

Et täällä voi olla sä paikoillaan,
Muuten tinakenkäsi sulaa

Juokse sinne missä on viileää

Kaija Koo,"Surujen sillalta näin
Tummien aaltojen uivan merelle päin
Ne ikäväni pintaan sai
Ja lokit kirkui ne karanneet on Hitchcockin linnuista kai
Kaipuuni nousee siivilleen
Kuka keksi rakkauden

Nähdä surujen sillalta sain
Kaupungin katolla tähtiä tuhansittain
Yksi lähti ja laskeutui
Se lensi halki taivaan ja radaltaan harhautui
Sille esitin kysymyksen
Kuka keksi rakkauden

Yö oli niin valkoinen
Kun puhalsi palkeet rakkauden
Tähdenlentona kai
Luokseni saavuit ja kauniimman teit minun maailmastain

Kuka keksi rakkauden
Kuka sai aikaan sen

Ei se lähde hengiltä millään
Tähtien tomuna se leijailee
Ja syttyy kuin itsestään

En minäkään täällä olla vois

Kailash Kher,"I don?t wish for riches
I wish only for your love
I?m yours, dear
You?re mine....

If you touch me
I can die in peace in love
Dear, come into my arms
I long to melt within you
I wish ... I could lose myself in your entirety


My days are lively with joy- my nights sing
They make me lost every passing moment
I?ve lost myself as I win you
Now I live just for you
I wish I could look at you forever
I wish I could worship your image
All my relations begin with you

I wish I could fall upon your body like a garland
I wish I could sail in love
Across the universe
I wish I could sail through this life in your love?


This is soft warm addiction? and it keeps on rising
I wish you could wake me like never
My heart has now known madness
My world has lighted up
Like a new bride
I?ve become yours, my love

As you adorn my temple with your love

I don?t wish for riches
I want you-
I don?t know anything more
Perhaps, you know?
I just know that I?m all yours-
And that you?re mine?
I just know that I?m all yours,
And you?re mine.
I know I?m all yours
And you?re mine, only mine?

That he's a liar

He said you're only as good as you are when you are with me
So I hope you're no better, know better than to leave

So many stories in the city I live in
I soak up the game, that everyone plays
I'm not the one so when they get caught sleepin
Out for the glory, there's so many stories around my way

It's been hard on us, day by day
Watchin my step gotta play where I lay
Now why this mother fucker want to test me out
It's this thang I'ma protect myself and blow his brains out

Cold on the streets never talk on the phone
And the main thing is never bring a snake in your home
But that's hard black, why?
'cause half the time them niggaz be in your face

smilin and shit but you don't know that
And I don't know why that nigga jealous of me
When he could do the same shit that pay me
In the streets breed a lot of killaz

That's why corners full of hate and the young ones is cap peelers 
But they don't feel us when we're drownin in our own blood
And they don't know when we go home it's no love
So what's the use of us carin and shit
And that's the reason we buy guns, load 'em up and spit 'em at shit

I know niggaz that was kings that turned into fiends
The nigga lost everything jewels and dreams
He losin teams, the murder rate higher than ever
Niggaz need more than weed gettin higher than ever

Niggaz roam with the heat just for somethin to eat
Niggaz sell to under covers then snitch on they brothers
Everybody sayin fuck us, I know God love us

(Mil a.k.a Hellraza)
I was raised when I cried in the household
Turned me into a nut
But these niggaz didn't know 
Just from bein home I seen enough before I learned the streets

I knew all about a gun 'cause my background was deep
A little dirty nigga holdin my pants when I run
It's a chance you gotta take everyday in the slums
This for the hoods where, certain people scared to come
I had a heart as a young nigga, now I don't fear none

What more can I say it been that way a long time
And anybody, who think that rude
Can suck my dick until they spit my baby girl need food

I was young, when Pac put my hands on a gun
And told me life is what you make it
And stripes you gotta take them
It took a while for me to over stand

I was only 12 but I felt like a grown man
And livin on, and that which does not kill me can only make me strong
But ya'll niggaz don't hear me though
My souljah story, for glorious pain

While I'm game you niggaz playin, played out and lame
This shit hurt, my mind blind my dick in the dirt
And I'm so sick of bein tired, and tired of bein hurt
I search out the truth, and that shit worse

I swear it's a curse that the church can't nurse, come on

Don't you know my name 

Don't suffocate me
Give me some space
Don't make me pay for all her mistakes
Believe in the love that's in my kiss
Don't see things that don't exist

Makin' you follow me, makin' me a suspect

This goes out to my nigga B.I.G.
Listen to me playboy, check dis out
I go, on and on and on and
Won't take her to the crib unless she's bonin'
PD call her on the phone and
Promise I'll leave her moanin'
Now she zonin'
Tellin' me she's all alone and
Love the dark chocolate tone and
Ahead of my time, I live what's said in my rhymes
The cars and the chedda is mine
We ain't, the type to sit back and lose focus
Spit that mack-a-docious
Most ferocious
Cash all in my holsters
Burn more bread than toasters
You must know this, the cats 'm with is the coldest
Hip-hop quota but quote this
Back on the track again, that's what's happenin'
Please believe it, we on top and won't leave it

[Chorus: Kokane]
Sometimes I feel like I'm lonely
And sometimes I feel like I'm lonely

[Kain]
Uh, uh, yeah
Hey yo see-I-O-F-F-I-E
Q-you-double E-N-Z
Come on ma your riding with me
Leave the lame respect the game
When you hanging on my arm you expect the same
And, ecstasy when you sex the Kain
I, only link with the wealthiest
And only cop jewels if it drop Celsius
Now, you can run but you can never hide
But, where you go when the temperature rise
It's Bad Boy see death in ya eyes
Kain Cioffe the next on the rise
Damagin' shit hot stamina split
You got screwball raps we the hammerin' clique
Limo, the club, and the cameras'll flip
Money, music women son we standin' in it HA!

[Chorus]
[Mark Curry]
Yo, yo, yo, yo
Don't panic, don't take this for granted
I did then still do and always ran it
A lot to gain when I say I'm off the chain
The shit I spit, burn flames
Who's controllin' this
I can make the bitches grin
Cause I get money and run with the richest men
Knockin' at ya door it's Curry again
Been down since the jump off begin
You know who I am
Don't get it all twisted up
Get the cash to my hands be all blistered up
We can pick it up, we can drop it low
Recognize what it is when I come through the door
Not partyin' and pimpin', I walk wit a limp
Once I took it to the top I ain't fell off since
Stay high stay fly stay cool in the fan
Ain't none of yall seein' ya man
Get a grip niggas

Don't worry about it dun I'm on the next thing smoking

Yo these funny talking cats tryin' to do a nigga foul
It's goin' down nigga round up the team
I'm'll head over here just to map out the scene
Ship them things in route to climb walls
Infrared vision ear plugs and all
Digital surveillance linked with laptops
Express mail it to me can't ???

Hey yo we gotta get him
I want to know where they came from
Or who sent them
First nigga to find them better bend'em
'cause I just spoke to Polly Fontaine
Shit ain't a game, and Sean feel the same
So why'all niggas betta get on point

[P. Diddy]
Well it seems like our bad boys have theirselves in a bit of a jam
Seems like Bristal got his back up against the wall
Well let's see how Rob be	-O handles this one
Bad boys watch ya backs
Watch ya backs bad boys

Yo, who the fuck is this pagin' me at eight forty six

Sense of urgency on the cell
We gon' pick you up, when ya flight land
We in a tight jam
Me and Diddy fam sorta like his right hand
I touch down like two-thirty
If i was on you, your hoe's and them cowards I'm'll do dirty
Still a commssion and we all equal
All lethal
Caught'em doin' dirt to the wrong people
It's the family affair, I'm here
With all of me I'm'll deal with this one accordingly
Got the locations sittin' in the console pacin'
Get bagged murder be the case and
And I'm tired in jail
Even though through the riots I prevailed
Enjoyin' my freedom, got two kids as long as I feed'em
I'm here for the fam that's there when I need'em

[Mark Curry]
Yo, uh uh uh, hello
It gotta be the same cats
I can tell by they strange acts
When they mumble to each other
Like Milan they run for cover
New 'cause this bitch that I fucked with
One thought I loved her
Seas debate the storm pull him the the surface
That's a purpose
One of these faces, make'em nervous
Catch'em when they out for hamburgers
Turn they whole lunch into a murder
In a way all the rounds gon' be heard of
This shits big, the first thing to catch to where PD is
I'm on it, act like they want it
I'm'll bring the heat
Just let me know the place we plan to meet
And I'm in it sure as your heart beat

[Loon]
Yo I ain't really tryin' to duck no strays
So watch what the fuck you say
It's ya mouth that started the shit
Now you actin' all retarted and shit
Dog I came to play my part and that's it
We had a fullproof plan, all we need was the fam
Ammunition, a van, two chicks and one extra man
Two lincoln LS Sedans
Fifteen hundred yards of saran
And after the scam, we be out in Amsterdam
Yo, call Sean in Milan
Call Sean tell Sean we gone
We'll meet him in Hong Kong
With two chicks both they thongs on
Mabe Ling and Kim Long
Both of them dead wrong
Two rich bitches the feds on

[P. Diddy]
Yeah, well it seems like brother Loon is out in Hong Kong
He's found his self in a sticky icky icky situation
But you know somethin' I have faith in the bad boys
Bad boys bring it on home, bring it on home bad boys

Heh, I'm bout to do Santa Dimengo

Stayin' at a hotel called the pink flamingo
Callin' up MC from a cuatro cinco
The set up, tryin' on my way to uniform
Room service bumpin' Kain on the newest song
Holdin' gats knowin' everything I do is wrong
'Till I hi-jack the sky flyin' on a unicorn
Downstairs with a bag of money and two clips
Talkin' to Loons chicks wit' sombreros and toothpicks
Sayin' they commit homicides for two bits
And fuck for dough like I give two shits
Wildfire call from Hong Kong
Hello (Loon: Yo Kain I just spotted Sean Jean)
Hold up, some information was missing
I just got the same page from Bris
He told me he saw Sean and two chicks followed by four whips
Somewhere in the Florida sticks
It's a set up
Tell the crew to keep their heads high
I'm gonna flip if any one of my mens die
We've been fucked somebody told us a bent-lie/Bentley (what?)
Let's get back to the spot in NY
Seven glocks P-S-P-O pops
Hit both the hot locks
Let'em read it that Diddy is on them hot blocks
So we sent two teams to rush both spots
Ha yeah!

Thumbs out watch the motherfuckin' door with our guns out

Mais si j'avais trouvé les bons mots à te dire
Trouvé les bonnes raisons de rester au lieu d'partir
Tu serais peut-être encore ma belle aujourd'hui

Tous mes amis me disent de profiter d'la vie
Que j'ai tellement tout c'qu'il faut pour construire un paradis mais
Mais l'illusion est parfaite quand l'habit fait pas l'moine
La solitude est pesante quand l'amour tombe en panne

Y'a tellement de monde dehors qui court après l'bonheur
Moi, on dirait qu'il m'évite à part peut-être aux p'tites heures
J'me souviens pu d'avant tellement que ça fait longtemps
J'suis pu au bout d'tes peines juste au bout des miennes

Et tu pars avec une partie d'ma vie

On jouait l'samedi pour la porte, pour la bière, pour des peanuts
On rêvait de plaines d'Abraham, de tournées dans notre caravane

Poussés par le rêve de vivre de notre art
Comme un souffle à nos oreilles nous disant de continuer d'y croire

On s'entêtait en français, on les aurait les Anglais
La pile de factures grandissait et nos p'tits cœurs s'époumonaient
Y'a eu l'orage y'a eu la foudre, les détracteurs, les semeux de doutes
Des nuits entières les yeux ouverts à faire la guerre aux couplets

On était poussés par le rêve de vivre de notre art
Comme un souffle à nos oreilles nous disant de continuer d'y croire
Poussés par le rêve de vivre de notre art
Comme un souffle à nos oreilles nous disant de continuer d'y croire

les rêves auxquels on veut bien croire
Des soirs on croit qu'on change les

Kaïn,"Y'en a qui courent après toute une vie durant
D'autres qui ne se salissent jamais les mains dedans
Y'en a qui tombent dessus au hasard du moment
Pis y'en a d'autres qui le gardent jamais bien longtemps

D'autres mots pour te dire
Pour le plaisir de faire changement

Si tu t'invites nulle part, tu mettras pas l'bon sort de ton bord
T'inviteras seulement tes peurs
Mais si tu t'arrêtes en chemin pis qu'tu souris pour rien
Tu seras un voleur de bonheur

Y'en a pour qui c'est jouer dans neige avec les p'tits
D'autres pour qui c'est le frisson du vendredi
Y'en a qui l'mettent en banque pour les jours de pluie
D'autres qui le dépensent sans jamais dire ""merci""

Si tu t'invites nulle part, tu mettras pas l'bon sort de ton bord
T'inviteras seulement tes peurs

Kaïn,"Non, j’veux rien savoir de personne
Juste savoir qu’la vie est bonne
Pas de règles et sans bornes
Toujours tout drette comme un bum

La guitare qui feedback pis le micro qui oscille facile
J’ai décidé en vain de pas prendre le chemin facile
De troquer ma Cadillac pour mon vieil Oldsmobile pas d’plaque
La bière entre les deux pattes, les pieds dans même bottine

Non, j’veux rien savoir de personne
Juste savoir qu’la vie est bonne
Pas de règles et sans bornes
Toujours tout drette comme un bum

J’ai mis mon chapeau d’poils pis ma vieille froc de cuir
Parti une heure en retard comme dans les maritimes
La radio qui m’étourdit, Faulkner dans l’tapis
Direction Lac Sauvage teaser la ouananiche

Non, j’veux rien savoir de personne
Juste savoir qu’la vie est bonne
Pas de règles et sans bornes
Toujours tout drette comme un bum

Comme un bum

J’ai pas pensé aux autres et perdu le contrôle
Rendu sur la grande côte, she said «Welcome aboard»
Et je repère le large avant de tomber raide mort
Les cheveux dans le vent du lac jusqu’à moelle de mon corps

Kaïn,"Toute bonne chose a un commencement
J’me l’suis pas dit assez souvent
Si j’commence par la fin
C’est peut-être bien qu’j’ai peur de m’arrêter en chemin

Paraît qu’on devient sage avec le temps
Pour moi, l’horloge s’est arrêtée avant
Si j’ai manqué le bateau qui est passé sous mon nez
Je nagerai dans l’eau de tous les océans pour toucher son quai

Paraît qu’y a juste les fous qui changent pas d’idées
Si je mets les voiles à chaque fois que l’amour se jette sur moi
C’est pas que j’sais pas aimer
Faut juste que je laisse le vent souffler de mon côté

Maman me laissait faire tout ce que je voulais
C’était sa façon de me dire qu’elle m’aimait
Je l’ai souvent dit trop vite en pensant que c’était mieux
Que de ne le vivre jamais

La marée monte comme la mer sur mon âge
Et recouvre tranquillement mon rivage
Je navigue sur une rivière d’encre et en irrigue les pages
Qui creusent les rides sur mon visage

Paraît qu’y a juste les fous qui changent pas d’idées
Si je mets les voiles à chaque fois que l’amour se jette sur moi
C’est pas que j’sais pas aimer
Faut juste que je laisse le vent souffler de mon côté

Et sous les tempêtes de peur
Se tiennent des moments de chaleur
Des p’tits jours de grands bonheurs
Simples et rieurs

Pour être heureux dans vie
Juste un p’tit bout d’terrain

De champagne, ni d’caviar

De petites semaines

Parce qu’au fond, rien n’est éternel
Encore moins les factures de Bell

Peut-être même un peu trop

Pour que puissent s’épanouir
Mes semailles chéries
Que poussent les rêves dans le champ de leur vie
Qu’ils puissent à leur tour semer l’amour

J’irai loin des grandes ruées
Loin des vendeurs d’or
De Silicon Valley
Loin des concours de hasard
Je resterai là, je resterai là

J’ai pas besoin d’être populaire
De finir premier et prospère
Ni d’ovations à tout rompre
D’un généreux compte en banque

Mais j’donnerais tout pour faire la peux
Et deux minutes avec moi
Pour faire un milieu de mes excès
Pour m’endormir sans trop de regrets

J’irai loin des grandes ruées
Loin des vendeurs d’or
De Silicon Valley
Loin des concours de hasard
Je resterai là, je resterai là

C’est vrai, j’mérite de temps en temps

This goes out to my nigga B.I.G.
Listen to me playboy, check dis out
I go, on and on and on and
Won't take her to the crib unless she's bonin'
PD call her on the phone and
Promise I'll leave her moanin'
Now she zonin'
Tellin' me she's all alone and
Love the dark chocolate tone and
Ahead of my time, I live what's said in my rhymes
The cars and the chedda is mine
We ain't, the type to sit back and lose focus
Spit that mack-a-docious
Most ferocious
Cash all in my holsters
Burn more bread than toasters
You must know this, the cats 'm with is the coldest
Hip-hop quota but quote this
Back on the track again, that's what's happenin'
Please believe it, we on top and won't leave it

[Chorus: Kokane]
Sometimes I feel like I'm lonely
And sometimes I feel like I'm lonely

[Kain]
Uh, uh, yeah
Hey yo see-I-O-F-F-I-E
Q-you-double E-N-Z
Come on ma your riding with me
Leave the lame respect the game
When you hanging on my arm you expect the same
And, ecstasy when you sex the Kain
I, only link with the wealthiest
And only cop jewels if it drop Celsius
Now, you can run but you can never hide
But, where you go when the temperature rise
It's Bad Boy see death in ya eyes
Kain Cioffe the next on the rise
Damagin' shit hot stamina split
You got screwball raps we the hammerin' clique
Limo, the club, and the cameras'll flip
Money, music women son we standin' in it HA!

[Chorus]
[Mark Curry]
Yo, yo, yo, yo
Don't panic, don't take this for granted
I did then still do and always ran it
A lot to gain when I say I'm off the chain
The shit I spit, burn flames
Who's controllin' this
I can make the bitches grin
Cause I get money and run with the richest men
Knockin' at ya door it's Curry again
Been down since the jump off begin
You know who I am
Don't get it all twisted up
Get the cash to my hands be all blistered up
We can pick it up, we can drop it low
Recognize what it is when I come through the door
Not partyin' and pimpin', I walk wit a limp
Once I took it to the top I ain't fell off since
Stay high stay fly stay cool in the fan
Ain't none of yall seein' ya man
Get a grip niggas

Shit ain't a game, and Sean feel the same
So why'all niggas betta get on point

Bad boys watch ya backs
Watch ya backs bad boys

Yo, who the fuck is this pagin' me at eight forty six

All lethal
Caught'em doin' dirt to the wrong people
It's the family affair, I'm here
With all of me I'm'll deal with this one accordingly
Got the locations sittin' in the console pacin'
Get bagged murder be the case and
And I'm tired in jail

Enjoyin' my freedom, got two kids as long as I feed'em
I'm here for the fam that's there when I need'em

Yo, uh uh uh, hello

When they mumble to each other
Like Milan they run for cover
New 'cause this bitch that I fucked with
One thought I loved her
Seas debate the storm pull him the the surface
That's a purpose
One of these faces, make'em nervous
Catch'em when they out for hamburgers
Turn they whole lunch into a murder
In a way all the rounds gon' be heard of
This shits big, the first thing to catch to where PD is

Just let me know the place we plan to meet
And I'm in it sure as your heart beat

Now you actin' all retarted and shit
Dog I came to play my part and that's it
We had a fullproof plan, all we need was the fam
Ammunition, a van, two chicks and one extra man
Two lincoln LS Sedans

And after the scam, we be out in Amsterdam
Yo, call Sean in Milan

Bad boys bring it on home, bring it on home bad boys

And fuck for dough like I give two shits
Wildfire call from Hong Kong
Hello (Loon: Yo Kain I just spotted Sean Jean)
Hold up, some information was missing

Abrí la puerta para no volver
Unos gines sudadera
Las botas viejas y ni atrás miré

Es normal equivocarse
Dar marcha atrás
Y estar dispuesto a recomenzar

Perdóname, quise vivir la vida
Y me deje llevar
Perdóname y una luz encendida
Me hizo regresar
Y pidiendo de rodillas
La miel de tu sonrisa

Casi nunca sabemos
Lo que tenemos
Y cuando el azar

En un cambio de juego
Medió el espejo de la realidad
Y que andaba buscando
Por todos lados alguien como tú
Dando palos de ciego

Buscando el norte
En pleno polo sur
No, podré recompensarte
Jamás podré
Pero te pido de corazón

Perdóname, quise vivir la vida
Y me deje llevar

You gotta slow down, gotta make it last,
Follow back to mine, (thats where we'll go)

Cause you play loud, where d'you get that sound?
I follow all the trends, (i follow the funk)
So come and meet my friends, (gotta meet my friends!

Like a best friend, you look quite the flair,
With your t-shirts on, (got all the shirts)
With all the right slogans.

Keep your head down, told you less is more,
Follow me down to...

I said hey now, what you do to me?
So don't try hard, you're accusing me,
Follow me, I know...
A better place to go...

I told you less is more so
Slow down, it's better also
To stop, to smell the flowers,
And interfere for hours, at least
You do it weekly, you lose
Yourself completely, the odds
Are better also, I told
You Less is More so.

But the evening came
And I lost you in the dark

Passed the village green
Where you were crouching by the bins
You were on your own
And hanging by the swings

And I was surprised
Now I'm not surprised
That you changed your mind
And you tried to hide (x2)

And I don't feel comfortable talking
To anybody except you
I don't feel comfortable talking
To anybody else

Hey, I'm back again
Was the world too small for you?
You were gone a year
And you'd done everything to do

It's a sad affair
Because nobody ever wins
Down the fire escape
I'll meet you by the bins

And I was surprised
Now I'm not surprised

Have another cup to celebrate
It doesn't cheer me up so I have eight

And you know when it goes in dirty
It comes out clean
There's not much on the TV this afternoon
Except Boone

In my room there's not a lot to do
So if I let you in please don't touch anything
And in my room there isn't much to do

Hold me down you're my dead end,
I said show me my mistakes again
Make me laugh that time you'd thrown me out, thrown me out
Why? Because

Oh, why do you do it to me?
Why do you always try to make me feel like a nobody?
Oh, why do you do it to me?
Why do you always try to make me feel like a nobody?

Didn't know I was part of the show now it's finally over
And you don't think I can function without you
Why do you try and disguise it when everyone knows it?
When you kick like that when I'm already down on the floor

Hold me down you're my dead end,
I said show me my mistakes again
Made me laugh that time you thrown me out, thrown me out

Didn't know we'd gotten this far)

Didn't know that we'd gotten this far and now I'm ready to throw it

Why do you have to have to surprise her?
When you've got it you show it
And then you cry like that and you throw yourself down on the floor

Mary Jane, I never been the same since our lips locked
The only lady that never gets pissed off
And if there's one thing I know
It's how to roll a J and let it burn real slow
For those who don't know I go by Slaydro
Ready, set, go
I take one to the dome like Pablo Esco
Germinate the seed then just let it grow
Then harvest like a pro
Dodging cops just to cop digits
Made the packs move and flip like they was gymnasts
Got me seeing dream green night vision
All truth, no fiction
Always fried like Popeye's Chicken
Hella mother hella motherfucker so you know I'm always know I'm always running late
Unless that currency at stake
In this Ruth Chris, truth is I'm ruthless
Forty in the-forty in the trunk gone in 20 minutes
That's 80K for the ticket
Everybody-everybody fucking with it
Smoking the container bet I'm always gon' retain it

It ain't nothing, joint stuffing, rolling blunts and
Big buds for breakfast crumble like a muffin
No discussion, smoking big dope with the fam
Stoney on the bus, used to hot box a van
In and out the cites, group the women and the weed
All these male groupies stepping unless you got tree
Better roll it and smoke it to the last drop
That cash crop stay up in the hash spot
Daily session, that Buddha blessing, never stressing
Laid back but I keep the whistle like I'm reffing
That's some rap nigga Shit
We Hugh Heffin'
Smoke out the grado
Feeling like Pablo
Saucing like tomato
Pulling numbers like Lotto

I'd be eighteen when 
She is turning twenty-three
Decorates her room with greeting cards

They burn up when she turns the light on in the dark

When the milk tasted like perfume
You had been drinking from the carton",Jessica,2006

When you wake up you'll be in such pain.
And I wait with the plate, piled high with my love
That you wont eat from

Love, you think you can contain me
But the future is already known
We give up our rest, and the best of us though
We'd be better off alone

There's no need to be so terrible
When you know I would do anything for you
This is so laughable, whatever happened to
Knowing that this was forever.
File off the sharpness of feelings so
I'll be protected from all of your evil
When you come round my love, I'll be gone, finally done
Never to come to your rescue.",2 O'Clock,2008

I see you strutting down the street, you look important huh?
I walk the other way, I don't wanna bother you with my sobriety

But now I don't interest you, I'm like a blog from 1999

You're so restless, uh huh uh huh, what can be over there?
I only see you when you're walking, walking to somewhere
You're so restless, uh huh uh huh, it must be special there

And the next night I see you sitting over there with girl number 115
Your fashion caught her eye, another conquest of your personality
I've tried to indicate that she could be someone for me
But every weekend I see you walking with her quarter to three

I only see you when you're walking, walking to somewhere
You're so restless, uh huh uh huh, what can be over there?

Knowing that we’re not going to stay

And we’re walking 
Talk about The Galapagos

Erosion, eruption and us

And we’re walking
Palms are sweating
Our hands let go
Keep on talking
Self-conscious, but it’s not gonna show

How it might have turned out

Takes both my hands

Kaleidoscope,"An old cowpoke went riding out one dark and windy day,
Upon a ridge he rested as he went along his way,
When all at once a mighty herd of red-eyed cows he saw,
A ploughin' through the ragged skies
And up a cloudy draw.
Yippee-yi-ay, yippee-yi-o,
The ghost herd in the sky.

Their brands were still on fire and their hooves was made of steel,
Their horns wuz black and shiny and their hot breath he could feel,
A bolt of fear went through him as they thundered through the sky,
For he saw the riders comin' hard
And he heard their mournful cry.
Yippee-yi-ay, yippee-yi-o,
Ghost riders in the sky.

Their faces gaunt their eyes were blurred and shirts all soaked
With sweat,
They're ridin' hard to catch that herd but they ain't caught them yet
'Cause they've got to ride forever on that range up in the sky,
On horses snortin' fire
As they ride on, hear their cry.
Yippee-yi-ay, yippee-yi-o,
Ghost riders in the sky.

As the riders loped on by him he heard one call his name,
""If you want to save your soul from hell a-riding on our range,
Then cowboy change your ways today or with us you will ride
A-try'ng to catch the devil's herd
Across these endless skies.""

The ghost herd in the sky.

Sometime love turns to hate
That's when it's all gone and it's just too late
I thought you was different from them other dudes
I've tried so hard to hold on with you
Yep by a minute I played a fool
I even let you sleep by with a lie or two
See I was your chic I ride for you
If I can't get down to it I ride for you
It took a little time for me to shake you off
Cause night and days I should break you off

Where your blackberry at ??? you get my e-mails
Now you're gonna sit here lie in my face

Kalenna,"Woke up late today, and I still feel the sting of the pain.
But I brushed my teeth anyway, got dressed through the mess and put a smile on my face.
I got a little bit stronger.

Riding in the car to work, and I'm trying to ignore the hurt.
So I turned on the radio, Stupid song made me think of you,
I listened to it for minute, but then I changed it.
I'm getting a little bit stronger, just a little bit stronger.

And I'm done hoping that we can work it out,
I'm done with how it feels, spinning my wheels
Letting you drag my heart around.
And ohhh
I'm done thinking, that you could ever change.
I know my heart will never be the same, 
But I'm telling myself I'll be okay.
Even on my weakest days, I get a little bit stronger.

Doesn't happen over night, but you turn around and a months gone by, 
And you realize you haven't cried.
I'm not giving you a hour or a second or another minute longer.
I'm busy getting stronger.

And I'm done hoping that we can work it out,
I'm done with how it feels, spinning my wheels
Letting you drag my heart around.
And ohhh
I'm done thinking, that you could ever change.
I know my heart will never be the same, 
But I'm telling myself I'll be okay.
Even on my weakest days, I get a little bit stronger.

Getting along without you baby,
I'm better off without you baby,
How does it feel with out me baby?
I'm getting stronger without you baby.

And I'm done hoping that we can work it out,
I'm done with how it feels, spinning my wheels
Letting you drag my heart around.
And ohhh
I'm done thinking, that you could ever change.
I know my heart will never be the same, 
But I'm telling myself I'll be okay,
Even on my weakest days, I get a little bit stronger.

And I'd be telling you white lies, whoa 
Yeah I'd be telling you white lies, 

Check, would you believe me if I told you some people do anything to please me 
From burning my all CDs as a free be 
To shop and taking pictures with my fans in Sainsburys 
Like I wonder if this company still got my C-V
Deep in, into my pocket no wonder I'm feeling jeans 
But this pocket full of dreams, ain't buying me what I need 
They say I should have loved this paper cause it's only made from trees 
But I need this lavish life from L-V this isn't free, let's ride

But the Lord's the only person that see me on my knees 
I don't wanna hear myself, turn me off don't turn me up 
And they kick you when you dancing now the trick is to stay up 
Plus as long as I'm alive, guess I'm running out of time 
Got my rolly hands in sweeping hand, tired of clockwise 
Some get left behind who don't move with the time 
Looking back, the only thing I wouldn't change was my mind, let's ride, let's ride

Now the reason that you fell ain't because you never climbed 
Now you're looking at your legs trying to work out where you stand 
See my dream came to life and okays came to death 
Caught up to your imagination running faster than your legs 
Now I feel I need to live before I end up lifeless 
I'm trying to buy the time even though it's priceless 
Dealing with the precious in the game 
Like I know that it's my decade and it'll have to be my game, let's flight

Yo se que tu a mi quieres besarme, pero me ocultas el sentimiento
Yo se que tu a mi quieres besarme mama, aunque no comprendes lo que siento
Dime que hago para enamorarte si creo que todo me lo he jugado
Te di todo lo que pude darte y no logro tenerte a mi lado

Si supieras mi amor que yo quiero estar contigo
Y no me dejas
Mira que con el tiempo se va a acabar el cariño

Que yo quiero enamorarte y con mis besos conquistarte

Si supieras mi amor que yo quiero estar contigo
Y no me dejas
Mira que con el tiempo se va a acabar el cariño
Y no regresas

Juro que te haré una caravana, llena de cohetes y canciones
El día que decidas darme tu alma, y de este hombre loco te enamores
El día que decidas darme tu alma, y de este hombre loco te enamores
Dime cuales son los requisitos pa poder meter mi hoja de vida
Conmigo todo será distinto por que en mi alma tu eres la elegida

Una rumba completa realizare mi reina, si me aceptas
Al tenerte a mi lado yo siento que se aleja, la tristeza
Es que no te imagino si algún día te me acercas, y me besas
Vamos a los carnavales y luego pa Cartagena (en plena fiesta!)

Hoy yo quiero enamorarte y con mis besos conquistarte

Fui tu vacilón, cuando yo te quería 
No voy a negar que tu gracia la tienes 
Eres natural, elegante y bonita 
Pero eres un mal, que había que detenerte 
Busca tu lugar, y quédate tranquila 
Muy bien que te pase por ser tan ilusa, ilusa, ilusa 
Meterte conmigo teniendo a tu novio ay a tu novio, ay pobre novio 
Todos saben que tú eres una pelusa 
Que lo engañas, que le mientes, para verse 
Con el uno y el otro 

No me llames, no me busques 
Implorándome perdón 
Ya no insistas, si tu sabes 
Que lo nuestro se acabo 
Ponte seria, coge juicio

Ese problema me tiene cansado 
Déjate de tanta friega 
Ya yo no aguanto un instante a tu lado 
Y ya yo no aguanto un instante a tu lado 
Déjame la vida quieta 

Y es que no se quien te enseño a ser tan mala 
Eres el temor de una buena familia 
En tu corazón no te pusieron nada 
Te volviste al fin, solamente carita 
Vas a convertir, tu vida en un desastre 
Si sigues así, actuando como vienes 
Eres un dolor de cabeza constante 
Hoy maldigo el día que llegue a conocerte 
Deja de llamarme cuando este borracho, tomando, de rumba 
Porque sabes que no puedo defenderme, se consciente, ay no seas mala 
Todos sabes que tú eres una pelusa 
Que no cambias, que te vuelas y que te escapas 
Y el otro inocente

Ay para salirme a buscar que problema 
Que no aguanto 
Ay no tengo tranquilidad

Déjate de tanta friega 
Eres malita, descarada

But they don't know, when they ain't looking I be doing population control
Then I'm looking for a breezy with a whole lot of soul so I can have a malfunction in my wardrobe

And I'm strapped with the pound and ? shoes, cackies, T shirts
Uh uh after my surrounding, air force ones, jeans, city lab
A fitted that's when I'm back in the town and don't get it confused
I'm proud to be gone, be home in a year with duffel bags out on the lawn

Do I leave out the back and grab my wallet and coat
Or do I answer real confused like ""I don't know""
Now me and she held hands and we danced, nothing more
She kissed my hand a couple times, FaceTime when we're bored

And when temptation calls (my phone), I never pick up
And girl, you stole my heart but you're too fucking young

And with the pigment on my skin
I don't want to be another statistic
You bring me joy, joy, joy, joy
And you fill a void that was once missing
And I can say I'm in love

Kalil Wilson,"Whenever skies look gray to me
And trouble begins to brew,
Whenever the Winter winds become too strong,
I concentrate on you.

When fortune cries ""Nay! Nay!"" to me
And people declare ""You're through!"",
Whenever the blues become my only song,
I concentrate on you.

On your smile so sweet, so tender,
When at first your kiss I decline.
On the light in your eyes when I surrender,
And once again our arms intertwine

And so, when wise men say to me
That love's young dream never comes true,
To prove that even wise men can be wrong,
I concentrate on you.",I Concentrate on You,2009

The moon may be high

I'll be tired of you  when stars are tired of gleaming
When I am tired of dreaming, then I'll be tired of  you.
This I know is true, when winds are tired of blowing,
When grass is tired of growing, then I'll be tired  of you.

Kalim,"Ah, Alles oder Nix, Ah
Ah, dieser Teufelskreis
Mein Kopf ist gefickt
Soll ich aufhören oder mach ich weiter?
Ah, 2012. Reasozialisiert, ah
Es gibt Tage die mein Kopf so ficken. Ich mein wie kann ich bloß auf Kombi ticken?
Bra, Banditen lauern um mich zu überfallen während Schultas dauernd mein Handy überwachen
Ich zweifle, will entscheiden, zwischen weiterleben mit Schutzweste oder mit 'ner weißen
Scheiße, ich schwöre man hat Hakim gepackt, sitzt Ossendorf und macht nichts mit Russen dort
Jedesmal wenn ein Ticker aus meinem Viertel gepackt wird, desto knapp wird
Meine Luft zum Atmen, ich mach Schluss mit Handeln, ist mein erster Gedanke
Hayde, weg mit der Waage
Doch die Tage verändert sich was, denn ich spür' in meiner Tasche nur noch kleine Batzen
Und sie schrumpfen, Tag für Tag, ich frag mich selbst: Was hab ich falsch gemacht?
Plötzlich tut es weh meinen AMG vollzutanken, ich denk schon ich fahr zu viel
Dazu schieb ich film wann ich Nachtflug geh und merke das auf meinem Tisch weniger Flaschen stehen
Dann am nächsten Tag, bei Foot Locker, fick ich meinen Kopf wegen paar Scheinen für Shox
Ich sag Stop, bis hierhin aber nicht weiter. Hole Handy, neue Nummer, bin wieder erreichbar!

Es ist ein Teufelskreis, gestern dacht ich khalas
Heute merk ich irgendwie fehlt mir da was
All die Kubinden die Stubinden auf mich warten und mir Batzen in Hand geben

Alles wie immer, es ist immer noch die gleiche Scheiße
Wir machen unser Para mit Haze und weißen Steinen
Packe ab den Stoff, nix da khalas
Ich geh raus in das Gesocks, liebe die Luft in diesen Blocks
Kein Stop, ich muss Parra hier im Drecksloch machen
Digga, meine ganze Straße will den Jackpot knacken
Alles gleich, schwarz, weiß
Wir bauen uns auf bis die alte Waage nicht mehr reicht
Die Amcas fahren vorbei, die Bischarafs drehen ne Runde durch den Block
Ich bleib ganz gechillt und ich bunker mein Stoff
Jedes Mal wenn ein Ticker aus meinem Viertel gepackt wird, füllt sich schneller die Kasse
Dieses Mal war ich dran wegen irgendso ein V-Mann
Nach Polizeischutz setze ich sein Haus in Brand
Ganze Nacht in der Zelle, ein scheiß Tag
Kaum bin ich raus, bin ich wieder erreichbar
Alles oder Nix!

Es ist ein Teufelskreis, gestern dacht ich khalas
Heute merk ich irgendwie fehlt mir da was

Im Treppenhaus, die Luft riecht nach Reis wie im Puff bei dein Thais 
mit letzten Hunderter-Schein geh ich raus
Vorher mit Taxi von A nach B, heute Filme schieben das mich ein Bonner verrät, mir
Fehlt es so sehr Bargeld zu machen durch SIM-Karten mit profitablen Kontakten
Will zum Stammlokal, speisen und trinken, doch krieg ein Schock 
wenn ich auf die Preisliste blicke und danach Einsicht kriege
Durch paar mal vermitteln ist es nicht mal machbar mein Magen zu stillen
Ist gut, ich wusste dieser Zug nimmt kein Ende, pack mein Handy
Such im Adressbuch, meine Quelle, von wegen letzte Ladung
Knollen alle riesig, Bomben-Habise wovon ich Pollen-Allergie krieg
Schreib an all meine Moshtaris: Was geht ab [?] Jungs, bin aktibiv hab [?] stabize bez da

Te juro te conviene quedarte amor
Yo respondo por tenerte
El amor que siento es diferente

Hecho a tu medida
Exclusivo de tu amor
Si te marchas me destrozas

Todo lo que se es que voy tras de tu cuerpo

why a donde voy
Siempre me he quedado a verte desde lejos

Voy tras de ti

Kalimba,"Ever since I saw you walking down with your men
Paying no attention barely graving your hand
Obvious to see that he don't give a damn
He don't love you.

See you later on, all alone at the bar
I don't know your name, but I know who you are
Love to make you feel like a superstar
Know you want to.

[Chorus]
Cause baby I'll drive you crazy
Giving you what you need every time you please
I said baby, don't need to worry
Just come with me tonight.

I want to go deep, deep, deep undercover
Want to, want to, be your down low lover
When you're in between my sheets
You'll be losing sleep
Rolling undercover with me.

I want to go deep, deep, deep undercover
Got to be discreet when it comes to each other
So if he sees me in the streets, he won't know it's me
Keep it undercover with me.

Sending you a message only you'll understand
Meet me on the low for a little romance
I'll make your body sing while your heart star to dance
Yeah! you'd love to
See it in your eyes girl I know you're afraid
But, by the way you move, you got something to say
Whisper in my ears, come and take me away
Yeah I'd love to

[Chorus]

Lay with me, we don't need to think about tomorrow
Then you'll see how good love is
For a while, baby let me take away your sorrow
Anything to see you smile.

Close to me, want to hold you tight
When I give you love
Come on, come on, can't you see
Let me show you real love, a man that could give you wath you need
Don't think about it just feel me.

And I noticed there wasn't a chair 

I sat on a rug biding my time 
Drinking her wine 
We talked until two and then she said 
""It's time for bed"" 

She told me she worked 
In the morning and started to laugh 
I told her I didn't

It’s kinda cool so I put on my jumper
Yeah, it remind me of Kehlani’s album cover
I might take a picture, put it on my Tumblr
Let’s get it
And I’m walking to the beat of the drummer
When I accidentally on purposely, bumped her
You know, and I don’t ever really ask for numbers
But with her I just might step out of my comfort zone
I’m like sorry, I didn’t mean to cross your path
And then she looked up at me and said that’s my bad
And we just smiled at each other with somewhat of a laugh
And for a moment, I think that I forgot where I was at cause
My heart felt like the 4th of July, and I couldn’t keep my 
Tongue from getting up in a tie
Yeah, and I won’t forget about that night
Cause I still get the same feeling with you every single time
I’m like

It’s your talk, that walk, I’m hypnotized (yeah yeah)
You came through and caught me by surprise (yeah yeah)
I didn’t know that you would change my life (yeah yeah)

Look
And there it go, it was just like that 
Cause we went from being friends to a happy ever after
Nicknames and laughter, she see imperfections but to me 
It’s like I’m looking at a master piece to the puzzle
She keep me out of trouble, came into my world
I’m all around that like the Hubble space telescope
She got me on the telephone, I can hear when she smile
I can tell by the tone and I said, baby how you get like that
She said what you mean and before I could respond back
I gotta tell you something, I don’t mean to get off track
I just remembered this dream I had the night before last
It was you and I on the 4th of July, I had my Vans on with a suit and a tie
And you came down the aisle, put your hands in mine

But it don’t take a rocket scientist
To see you should be mine
Girl, I don’t wanna see a world with you
There wouldn’t be a world without you

So don’t you get caught up in no drama, no
And I know you wanna look like the models, yeah
But ain’t nobody else like you
So go and do what you do

Look
Ok, so lately I been thinkin’ a lot about the present
And what it really means to really be present like
Counting blessings and not really stressing
Bank accounts are cool but they say the best things
In this life all come free
So tell me the real definition of what it means to succeed
Might be a little different than what you see on TV
And it’s a big big world past your cell phone screen
So keep your head up and your eyes open wide
And make sure that your happiness starts from inside
Listen to your heart and you won’t get a lie
And you’re the only you and that’s hekka tight, yeah
But confidence is key, believe in yourself and I promise you’ll see
Don’t let insecurity, distractions make it hard for you to see

So don’t you get caught up in no drama, no
And I know you wanna look like the models, yeah
But ain’t nobody else like you

So think negative and you can see negative 
But think positive and you can see positive
And I know that this might sound a little random
But if you get the opportunity don’t be scared
To give someone a compliment
Wait, stop the beat. Let’s just talk for a second:
Remember what I was saying about really being present?
‘Cause the song is about to be over in a minute but if you
Get some time later, just think about those lyrics.
And then we back into it, I just had to make that clear
It’s kinda crazy how we both ended up right here 
‘Cause I don’t really know you and you don’t really know me
But I do know what’s meant to be will be
Trust the journey that this life is gonna take you 
Be true to who you are, love yourself and embrace you

Siempre encuentro consuelo
Porque aunque tú estés lejos
Es el mismo techo

Si escribo poemas en que
Hable de tus recuerdos
Sé que tu oracion en respuesta
Es pierdes tu tiempo

why el mismo no es en vano
He vivido demasiado
Aún con tanta historia
Tú estás, why permanecerás

Te abrazaré
Why te besare en mis sueños
Despertare, mojada en tu recuerdo

Caminaré sabiendo que un día
Estuve entre tus dedos

Seras mi estigma de amor
Pues te tuve why perdí tu vuelo

Mirando entre las calles
Yo hallé tu silueta
Why voy desesperadamente
A entregarte un abrazo

No llego a la esquina del tren
A enfrentar mi fracaso
Por miedo a saber quien es ella
Que hoy coge tu mano

El tiempo no es en vano
He vivido demasiado
Aún con tanta historia
Tu estas, why permanecerás

Te abrazaré
Why te besare en mis sueños
Despertare, mojada en tu recuerdo

Caminaré sabiendo que un día
Estuve entre tus dedos

Seras mi estigma de amor
Pues te tuve why perdí tu vuelo

Que dificil es borrar
Memorias más allá del cuerpo
Convertiste el amor en todo un misterio

why aunque ya no estés, no importa
Ya solo basta con saberlo

Te abrazaré
Why te besare en mis sueños
Despertare, mojada, mojada en tu recuerdo

Caminaré sabiendo que un día
Estuve entre tus dedos

Seras mi estigma de amor
Pues te tuve why perdí tu vuelo

Seras mi estigma de amor
Ya es orgullo saber que
Tu boca me perteneció

All I want is to sing it out loud

So I say thank you for the music
For giving it to me

She says I began to sing long before I could talk

Who found out that nothing can capture a heart
Like a melody can?
Well, whoever it was, I'm a fan

In our lives we have walked some strange and lonely treks
Slightly worn but dignified and not too old for sex
