Dizzy Gillespie,"Sweet and lovely
Sweeter than the roses in May
Sweet and lovely
Heaven must have sent him my way

Skies above me
Never were as blue as his eyes
And he loves me
Who would want a sweeter surprise?

When he nestles in my arms so tenderly
There's a thrill that words cannot express
In my heart a song of love is taunting me
Melody haunting me

Sweet and lovely
Sweeter than the roses in May
And he loves me
There is nothing more I can say

When he nestles in my arms so tenderly
There's a thrill that words cannot express
In my heart a song of love is taunting me
Melody haunting me

Sweet and lovely
Sweeter than the roses in May
And he loves me
There is nothing more I can say

There is nothing more I can say
There is nothing more I can say
There is nothing more I can say
There is nothing more I can say",Sweet and Lovely [Alternate Take],2004
Dizzy Gillespie,"Once in a while will you try to give
One little thought to me
Though someone else may be
Nearer your heart?

Once in a while will you dream
Of the moments I shared with you
Moments before we two
Drifted apart?

In love's smoldering ember
One spark may remain
If love still can remember
That spark may burn again

I know that I'll be contented
With yesterday's memory
Knowing you think of me
Once in a while

In love's smoldering ember
One spark may remain
If love still can remember
The spark may burn again

I know that I'll be contented
With yesterday's memory
Knowing you think of me
Once in a while",Once in a While [DVD],2005

Dizzy Gillespie,"You went away
I let you
We broke the ties that bind
I wanted to forget you
And leave the past behind
Still, the magic of the night I met you
Seems to stay forever in my mind

The sky was blue
And high above
The moon was new
And so was love
This eager heart of mine was singing
Lover where can you be

You came at last
Love had its day
That day is past
You've gone away
This aching heart of mine is singing
Lover come back to me
When I remember every little thing

You used to do
I'm so lonely
Every road I walk along
I walk along with you
No wonder I am lonely

The sky is blue
The night is cold
The moon is new
But love is old
And while I'm waiting here

You used to do
I grow lonely
Every road I walk along
I walk along with you

Dizzy Gillespie,"Listen to my tale of woe, 
It's terribly sad but true, 
All dressed up, no place to go 
Each evening I'm awfully blue. 

I must win some handsome guy 
Can't go on like this, 
I could blossom out I know, 
With somebody just like you. so

Oh, sweet and lovely lady, be good 
Oh, lady, be good to me 
I am so awfully misunderstood 
So lady, be good to me 
Oh, please have some pity 
I'm all-alone in this big city 
I tell you I'm just a lonesome babe in the wood, 
So lady be good to me. 

Oh, please have some pity 
I'm all alone in this big city 
I tell you I'm just a lonesome babe in the wood, 
So lady be good to me. 
Oh lady be good to me.",Lady Be Good,2006
Dizzy Gillespie,"You know, the landlord rang my front door bell
I let it ring for a long, long spell
I looked through the window, I peeked through the blind,
And asked him to tell me what was on his mind.
He said, ""Money, honey!
Money, honey!
Money, honey,
If you want to get along with me.""

I was cleaned and skinned and so hard-pressed
I called the woman that I love the best
I finally reached my baby 'bout a half past three
She said, ""I'd like to know what you want with me.""
I said, ""Money, honey!
Money, honey!
Money, honey,
If you want to get along with me.""

She screamed and said, ""What's wrong with you?
From this day on, our romance is through.""
I said, ""Tell me, baby, face to face
A-how could another man take my place?""
She said, ""Money, honey!
Money, honey!
Money, honey,
If you want to get along with me.""

Well, I learned my lesson and now I know
The sun may shine and the wind may blow
Women may come, and the women may go,
But before I say I love 'em so,
I want-- money, honey!
Money, honey!
Money, honey,
If you want to get along with me.
(If you want to get along) Well, make some money
(If you want to get along) Well, I ain't jivin' you, honey
(If you want to get along) You better give up some money
If you want to get along with me.",Money Honey,2006
Dizzy Gillespie,"It's cost me a lot
But there's one thing that I've got 
It's my man
Cold and wet, tired you bet
But all that I soon forget 
With my man
He's not much for looks 
And no hero out of books 
Is my man
Two or three girls has he 
That he likes as well as me
But I love him! 
I don't know why I should
He isn't good, he isn't true
He beats me too
What can I do?
 
Oh, my man I love him so
He'll never know
All my life is just despair
But I don't care 
When he takes me in his arms 
The world is bright, all right
What's the difference if I say
I'll go away, When I know
I'll come back on my knees some day?
For whatever my man is 
I am his forever more
Oh, my man I love him
 
Sometimes I say 
If I could just get away 
With my man
He'd go straight sure as fate
For it never is too late
For a man
I just like to dream 
Of a cottage by a stream 
With my man
Where a few flowers grew
And perhaps a kid or two
Like my man
And then my eyes get wet
I most forget till he gets hot
And tells me not to talk such rot
 
Oh, my man I love him so
He'll never know
All my life is just despair
But I don't care 
When he takes me in his arms 
The world is bright, all right
What's the difference if I say 
I'll go away, When I know
I'll come back on my knees some day?
For what ever my man is 
I am his forever more",My Man [Mon Homme],2006
Dizzy Gillespie,"Love makes me treat you

The way that I do
Gee baby, ain't I good to you

There's nothing in this whole world too good
For a boy so sweet and true
Gee, baby ain't I good to you

Bought you a fur coat for Christmas
Diamond ring
Big Cadillac car and everything
What makes me treat you
The way that I do
Gee baby, ain't I good to you","Gee Baby, Ain't I Good To You",2006
Dizzy Gillespie,"It was a lucky April shower
It was the most convenient door
I found a million dollar baby
In a five and ten cent store.
The rain continued for an hour.
I hung around for three or four.
Around a million dollar baby
In a five and ten cent store.

She was selling china
And when she made those eyes,
I kept buying china 
Until the crowd got wise.

Incidentally
If you should run into a shower,
Just step inside my cottage door,
And meet the million-dollar baby
From the five and ten cent store.
Love comes along like a popular song
Any time or anywhere at all.

Rain or sunshine
Spring or fall.
Say, you'll never know when it may say hello
In a very unexpected place.
For example, take my case.

Dizzy Gillespie,"On a picnic morning without a warning
I looked at you and somehow I knew
On a day for singing,
My heart went winging
A picnic grove was our rendezvous
You and I in the sunshine
We strolled the fields amd farms
At the last light of evening,
I held you in my arms
So when days grow stormy
And lonely for me
I just recall picnic time and you.",Theme From Picnic,2006
Dizzy Gillespie,"I'm up in the world,
but I'd give the world to be where I used to be,
A heavenly nest,
where I rest the best,
means more than the world to me.

It's only a shanty
in old Shanty Town
the roof is so slanty it touches the ground.
But my tumbled down shack by an old railroad track,
like a millionaire's mansion is calling me back.

I'd give up a palace if I were a king.
It's more than a palace, it's my everything.
There's a queen waiting there with a silvery crown
in a shanty in old Shanty Town.",In a Shanty in Old Shanty Town,2008
Dizzy Gillespie,"I got rhythm....I got music....I got my gal
Who can ask for anything more
I got daisies....In green pastures....I got my gal

You won't find him.... 'round my door
I got starlight...I got sweet dreams...I got my gal

Dizzy Gillespie,"It begins to tell,
'round midnight, midnight.
I do pretty well, till after sundown,
Suppertime I'm feelin' sad;
But it really gets bad,
'round midnight.

Memories always start 'round midnight
Haven't got the heart to stand those memories,
When my heart is still with you,
And ol' midnight knows it, too.
When a quarrel we had needs mending,
Does it mean that our love is ending.
Darlin' I need you, lately I find
You're out of my heart,
And I'm out of my mind.

Let our hearts take wings'

Happy girlie, you will see, 
I've got someone nice, oh, gee! 
Oh, joy, what bliss! 

Just the treasure that I need, 
Pure as gold and guaranteed, 
Is he handsome? Yes, indeed! 
Let me tell you this: 

I found a new baby, 
A sweet honey boy, 
My fashion-plate baby 
Has thrilled me with joy! 

His new way of lovin' 
Has made me his slave,

Tells me lies, but he's wise, naughty eyes mesmerize, I vow and how!

Dizzy Gillespie,"I was a stranger in the city
Out of town were the people I knew
I had that feeling of self-pity
What to do, what to do, what to do
The outlook was decidedly blue

But as I walked through the foggy streets alone
It turned out to be the luckiest day I've known

A foggy day, in London town
Had me low, had me down
I viewed the morning, with much alarm
British Museum, had lost its charm

How long I wondered,
Could this thing last
But the age of miracles, hadn't past
For suddenly, I saw you there
And through foggy London town,
The sun was shining everywhere

I can't see anyone but you

Are the stars out tonight

I only have eyes for you dear

The moon may be high
But I can't see a thing in the sky
I only have eyes for you

I don't know if we're in a garden
Or on a crowded avenue

You are here and so am I
Maybe millions of people go by
But they all disappear from view
And I only have eyes for you",I Only Have Eyes For You,2012
Dizzy Gillespie,"My thoughts go back to a heavenly dance
A moment of bliss we spent
Our hearts were filled with a song of romance
As into the night we went
And sang to our hearts' content

The song is ended
But the melody lingers on
You and the song are gone
But the melody lingers on

The night was splendid
And the melody seemed to say
""Summer will pass away
Take your happiness while you may""

There 'neath the light of the moon
We sang a love song that ended too soon

The moon descended
And I found with the break of dawn
You and the song had gone
But the melody lingers on",The Song is Ended,2012
Dizzy Gillespie,"Walked with no one and talked with no one
And I had nothing but shadows
Then one morning you passed
And I brightened at last
Now I greet the day and complete the day
With the sun in my heart
All my worry blew away
When you taught me how to say

Grab your coat and get your hat
Leave your worry on the doorstep
Just direct your feet
To the sunny side of the street
Can't you hear a pitter-pat?
And that happy tune is your step
Life can be so sweet
On the sunny side of the street

I used to walk in the shade
With those blues on parade
But I'm not afraid

On the sunny side of the street
Grab your street",On the Sunnyside of the Street,2013
Dizzy Gillespie,"You know the feeling of something half remembered
Of something that never happened, yet you recall it well
You know the feeling of recognizing someone
That you've never met as far as you could tell, well

Laura is the face in the misty light
Footsteps that you hear down the hall
The laugh that floats on a summer night
That you can never quite recall
And you see Laura on the train that is passing through
Those eyes, how familiar they seem
She gave your very first kiss to you
That was Laura but she's only a dream",[Untitled],2013
Dizzy Gillespie,"The shadow of your smile
When you have gone
Will color all my dreams
And light the dawn

Look into my eyes my love and see
All the lovely things you are to me

It was far, too high
A teardrop kissed your lips
And so did I

All the joys that love can bring
I will be remembering

Wake up and end the day thinking of you?
Oh, why does it do this to me?

It seems you just tip-toe into all my dreams
So I think of no other one
Ever since I've begun thinking of you

I can see that this love was meant for me
Only a poor fool never schooled in the whirlpool
Of romance could be so cruel as you are to me

Without you life will never begin to be
So love me as I love you in my reverie
Make my dream a reality

Come to me in my reverie

Dizzy Gillespie Alumni All-Stars,"It's cost me a lot
But there's one thing that I've got 
It's my man
Cold and wet, tired you bet
But all that I soon forget 
With my man
He's not much for looks 
And no hero out of books 
Is my man
Two or three girls has he 
That he likes as well as me
But I love him! 
I don't know why I should
He isn't good, he isn't true
He beats me too
What can I do?
 
Oh, my man I love him so
He'll never know
All my life is just despair
But I don't care 
When he takes me in his arms 
The world is bright, all right
What's the difference if I say
I'll go away, When I know
I'll come back on my knees some day?
For whatever my man is 
I am his forever more
Oh, my man I love him
 
Sometimes I say 
If I could just get away 
With my man
He'd go straight sure as fate
For it never is too late
For a man
I just like to dream 
Of a cottage by a stream 
With my man
Where a few flowers grew
And perhaps a kid or two
Like my man
And then my eyes get wet
I most forget till he gets hot
And tells me not to talk such rot
 
Oh, my man I love him so
He'll never know
All my life is just despair
But I don't care 
When he takes me in his arms

Ican't help it if that doggoned moon above
Makes me need someone like you to love!

Blame your kiss as sweet as a kiss can be
And blame all your charms that melt in my arms
But don't blame me.

I like every single thing about you
Without a doubt you are like a dream
In my mind I find a picture of us as a team

Ever since the hour of our meeting
I've been repeating a silly phrase
Hoping that you'll understand me one of these days.

Don't blame me for falling in love with you
I'm under your spell but how can I help it!

",A Night in Tunisia,
Dizzy Gillespie Big Band,"I was a hum-drum person
Leading a life apart
When love flew in through my window wide
And quickened my hum-drum heart
Love flew in through my window
I was so happy then
But after love had stayed a little while
Love flew out again

What is this thing called love?
This funny thing called love?
Just who can solve its mystery?
Why should it make a fool of me?
I saw you there one wonderful day
You took my heart and threw my heart away
That's why I ask the Lawd up in Heaven above
What is this thing called love?

You gave me days of sunshine
You gave me nights of cheer
You made my life an enchanted dream
'Til somebody else came near
Somebody else came near you
I felt the winter's chill
And now I sit and wonder night and day
Why I love you still",What Is This Thing Called Love?,
Dizzy Gillespie Big Band,"When they begin the beguine
It brings back the sound of music so tender
It brings back a night of tropical splendor
It brings back a memory ever green

I'm with you once more under the stars
And down by the shore an orchestra's playing
And even the palms seem to be swaying
When they begin the beguine

To live it again is past all endeavor
Except when that tune clutches my heart
And there we are, swearing to love forever
And promising never, never to part

What moments divine, what rapture serene
Till clouds came along to disperse the joys we had tasted
And now when I hear people curse the chance that was wasted
I know but too well what they mean

So don't let them begin the beguine
Let the love that was once a fire remain an ember
Let it sleep like the dead desire I only remember
When they begin the beguine

Oh yes, let them begin the beguine, please make them play
Till the stars that were there before return above you
Till you whisper to me once more, ""Darling, I love you""
Then we suddenly know what heaven we're in
When they begin the, begin the, begin the beguine

When they begin the, begin the, begin the beguine

Dizzy Gillespie Quintet,"It was a lucky April shower
It was the most convenient door
I found a million dollar baby
In a five and ten cent store.
The rain continued for an hour.
I hung around for three or four.
Around a million dollar baby
In a five and ten cent store.

She was selling china
And when she made those eyes,
I kept buying china 
Until the crowd got wise.

Incidentally
If you should run into a shower,
Just step inside my cottage door,
And meet the million-dollar baby
From the five and ten cent store.
Love comes along like a popular song
Any time or anywhere at all.

Rain or sunshine
Spring or fall.
Say, you'll never know when it may say hello
In a very unexpected place.
For example, take my case.

But there's one thing that I've got 
It's my man
Cold and wet, tired you bet

With my man
He's not much for looks 
And no hero out of books 
Is my man
Two or three girls has he 
That he likes as well as me
But I love him! 
I don't know why I should
He isn't good, he isn't true
He beats me too
What can I do?
 
Oh, my man I love him so
He'll never know
All my life is just despair
But I don't care 
When he takes me in his arms 
The world is bright, all right
What's the difference if I say
I'll go away, When I know
I'll come back on my knees some day?
For whatever my man is 
I am his forever more
Oh, my man I love him
 
Sometimes I say 
If I could just get away 
With my man
He'd go straight sure as fate
For it never is too late
For a man
I just like to dream 
Of a cottage by a stream 
With my man
Where a few flowers grew
And perhaps a kid or two
Like my man
And then my eyes get wet
I most forget till he gets hot
And tells me not to talk such rot
 
Oh, my man I love him so
He'll never know
All my life is just despair
But I don't care 
When he takes me in his arms

So don't you be around

Don't you be around

Tonight there's gonna be trouble
Some of us won't survive
See the boys and me mean business
Bustin' out dead or alive

I can hear the hound dogs on my trail
All hell breaks loose, alarm and sirens wail
Like the game if you lose
Go to jail

Tonight there's gonna be a jailbreak
Somewhere in the town
Tonight there's gonna be a jailbreak
So don't you be around

Tonight there's gonna trouble
I'm gonna find myself in
Tonight there's gonna be a jailbreak
So woman stay with a friend

You know it's safer

Breakout!

Tonight there's gonna be a breakout
Into the city zones
Don't you dare to try and stop us
No one could for long

Searchlight on my trail
Tonight's the night all systems fail
Hey you good lookin' female
Come here!

Dizzy Lizzy,"The boom time it is over
A ghost town is all that's left here
The gold rush it is over
And depression days draw near

Tonight after sundown
I'm going to pack my case
I leave without a sound
Disappear without a trace

I'm going southbound

Drifting like a drover
Chasing my career
From the ships docked in the harbour
New horizons will appear

Tumbling with the tumbleweed
Down the open road
Taking only what I need
Before my head explodes

I'm going southbound

Hey, you're not getting any younger
The wild west has already been won
Northern lights are growing colder
And the old eastern ways are gone

You must go from this place
Without a tear, without a frown
Disappear without a trace

A bullet from a forty-five

God, may he rest in peace

Forgotten in a file

Dizzy Reece,"Once in a while will you try to give

Of the moments I shared with you
Moments before we two
Drifted apart?

In love's smoldering ember
One spark may remain
If love still can remember
That spark may burn again

I know that I'll be contented

Not for a year but ever and a day
The radio and the telephone and the movies that we know
May just be passing fancies and in time may go

But oh, my dear, our love is here to stay
Together we're going a long, long way
In time the Rockies may crumble, Gibraltar may tumble
They're only made of clay

You say, you good, like you may be home
But in my heart I know you may be wrong
I wish you understood I wouldn't agreed to a baby 
If you was gonna be beefing with other hoods, you trynna play me out
A negative is how you make me out but if something happened 
To you which one of your homies gonna help me raise this child?

I pray to God that you keep my baby strong

She go to school, take care of shit, ain't scared of shit
She meditate, she elevate, she hella sick
She hella smart, got a glow like the sun itself
She lives by the streets, there's no running for help
Only come for the wealth, won't touch her, she comes by her self
The lonely stoner, her soul is gunnin' for health
You look at her beauty, she don't pay you no mind
Rozay wine for the time, tryna make you a dime
Lost minds, invitations to situations
Portrayal imitations, changing as you flip them faces
Is it worth it? Remember your purpose
It's not forever, make it happen, it will feel amazin'
I told her, blessings come with patience, but patience come with growth
Filled with wisdom, been taking notion, found this patience in my smoke
My time (my time), problems are not stop signs, they're guidelines
Stop wishin' and start doing, can't be worried bout' what's not mine

Naturally, the ship she wanted she takin' it home
She takin' him down, probably won't take him that long
Shadows of life, come from when we be blockin' our own
Don't cry because it's over baby, smile because it happened
You walkin' away slow, but you never walk backwards
Someone's opinions of you shouldn't change none of yo' habits
Procrastination, is opportunities assassin
It's a habit, we establish, live so average, not my passion
But knowledge is no value, unless we put it into practice
Look, health is the greatest gift, contentment is the greatest wealth
Faithfulness, is the best relationship, now find it in yourself
Took the time to make myself, took what I've been through, in a strong way
Missin' 100% of the shots that you don't take, you gotta believe
How to achieve after you make it, the best way to predict is to create it

I told her, small deeds done are better than, great deeds planned
Anyone who has never made a mistake, has never tried anything new
We need to, worry about in the now, whats your purpose?
The secret to happiness is freedom, and the secret to freedom is courage
You doing things right, but are you doing the right things?
You don't need a man, but you want a man
You don't need a plan you are the plan
Look in the mirror and ask yourself, who am I?
You my queen, are the ruler to anything you prosper
And if it gets awkward, think like a toddler
Only you can slow you down

What if I told you I was lost
My vision bad but I could see me in the future being a boss
Given orders and order to holla at my supporters
I need somebody to give me a call, shit
Tell me I'm loved, tell me you proud of me
'Cause shits changed
It's taking a whole lot outta me
My daddy don't love me
Or maybe he do, but he ain't around
I hope you know I ain't just laying around, shit
I got off my ass and I chose to get it in
I turned my homies into buisness men
So I just gotta sin
Put on the city of sin with my friends
Now me and all of my niggas pitchin' in
I hope you understand, this ain't a sob story
I did this by myself
No one did the job for me
I took a different route
Right road into discussion
Took a minute to bubble
Now we on the finishing touches
Now I'm all in public
And I love it
Not cause I'm buzzin'
In God we trust
I'm asking God can you guide me love
So much to believe, too much to retrieve
I just hope I get it out before I leave

I just hope you realize what I was worth

It's cool cause my momma's a little more involved
When she gives me problems I just smoke it off
She said she loves my message so she's quick to show me off
I know enough but I don't know it all
I listen it all my big hommies
To get advice as a man
I grew up trifling but tried to advance
Even when I was six
I got a pick with a mic in my hand
I'm proud of myself I like where I am
See I just want to be heard
Respected and comfortable
Even when I'm away say daddy still lovin you
Typical tho, you into your toys I'm into my flows
But baby girl it takes a minute to blow
So I swallow my product
Spit the truth and now they follow my ride
I make visuals for my visions
And now they follow my rhymes
Thank God for my blessings
I grew up unprotected
Not neglected, stressed a little, seen a talent and perfect it
So when you let them know about me
Let them know I gotta be remembered

And they take me off this earth

It's a way of life
You way out the facts
You livin a lie, we live and we die
Who gives a fuck
They only judging cause we live it up
And barely gettin by
But I still keep a smile on my face
I learned how to set my negatives to the side
And just smile thru the day
Some times it gets overwhelming
Coming down off my high
Getting depressed with all this shit I dealt with
I feel selfish but let me make that shit a little clearer
I ain't rude I just need to work on the man in the mirror
Starting from where I lack
Back to were I was at
So I can see the growth
You can even hear it in my raps
Potential green
May half of these niggas disintegrate
You limit yourself you've been a fake

You know me from my beginner stage

Looking into your eyes wondering what you're abusing
Humble to abusive confuse it what you're pursuin'
Cause' I don't know what you doin' and you don't know what
You losin'
We all got it, we all got to feel ??? We all got to deal
With it as a friend, as a fan I was supportin' I just never wanted
You to lose sight of what was important
I blame myself for a hell of a job
Now them drugs got you questionin' God
I'm heart brokin' cause' I didn't even notice I was always on my grind
And you was slowly losing focus wish you would've been more
Open I'm still praying shit tryin' to help
But only you can find God in yourself
Time is running out and man I'm trying to find you some help
So glorify your situation and put time in yourself
Cause' you don't want that love
My nigga put that down
You don't need that shit
I don't believe this shit
Can't be believin' you if you believin' this
This from the heart they ain't teaching me shit
We all got problems, we all need change bro
Handle shit different, but we all in the same boat
Escape your fears, tryna' take what ain't yours
My nigga you don't want that love, you don't want that love
Attention ain't everything
Honestly half of the time it's envy
You look for it you gon' find but it ain't gon' be the
Attention that you thought you was gettin'
Bad decisions in a matter of minutes push you to the limits
Be mad that you did it, are you kiddin'
Play trippy, start trippin'
Then you a dream into a mission just to miss it

Niggas wanna get on but I'm a long way from going home
Going hard 'til the day that I'm old

Sipping this Honey Jack shit 'til it's gone
Everybody wanna kick it in the V.I.P. with Jarren Benton and the D-I-Z

Heat off teens, geeked off beans
Slap a motherfucker, then I squeak off clean
Can't be sort of macking, bitch I'm candy quarter stacking
Made me snap and grab that ratchet from my Ralphy Lauren fashion
Tech is squeezing this ammo, now rest in peace on his mantle
Took his bitch and killed that pussy like second season Sopranos
Had a good run now you don't want to quit
Hit him with the butt of the clip

Started from the bottom now I'm under your bitch
Death defying

Remember me, the nigga that you said wouldn't make it
Got a base-side whore in the bed, butt-naked
Zac Morris nigga, I'm a problem, I'm a headache
12's in the back, got'em kicking like Pelé
Kato on a warm day, might be in L.A.,
Nice breeze, palm trees, hanging with the esés
Heard about the gun ban yesterday my homeboy
Went and got a motherfucking SK
To me that feels mulled off, probably means Zoloft
Can't shake the problems in my life they won't roll off
Lately I've been hanging around Kaine like O-Dog,
Feeling paranoid, am I tripping on all y'all
Life's in Atlanta
I might go bananas
No Basquiat nigga
My paint on this canvas
These voices I hear
When they call me I answer
Keep feeding me rappers
I'll eat 'em like cancer
Aghh
I go ape shit
I am not a human being, speak a different language
Shawty give me stupid head, call the ho brainless
Funny what these sucka niggas do to get famous

I'm talking AK47, Purple Kush and Sour D
Put it in the bowl, I'll get a dutchie rolled
Sprinkle some keef on it, and then away we go
Get in the flow, lighting up heady to dro
Partying on, got that confetti to throw
Killing the spot from the moment

Found the weed before we went exploring it
This talent is what I was born with
Took about twenty years before I was touring it
Do you like it? Cause it's the first time you done heard it
Just wait 'til you see me performing it
I'm so live on the stage cause I smoke and I rage
And I jump on the crowd like I'm Method Man
So I'm puffin and rapping my verse on they hands
So high I hope that I never land
See a lot of niggas that I'm better than
In my FV letterman, on a plane
Headed somewhere I ain't never been
Always on the move, I don't settle in
Coming for the mother fucking throne (Yiggity Yuhh)
In a crazy city known to let the devil in
Every time he knock knock knock, girls let him in
Gotta dumb it down to stay two steps ahead of them, call me competitive
But I still got what you was trying to be, a clone
Now I'm pulling up the-

Independent, sold out shows, and I don't think that's changing!
My fans say they wanna see me turn it up, and I can't leave ya'll hangin'
Bout that life, who came to see me rock this crowd? Damn, I must be famous
Came so far and it feels so amazing, and now we dealing with a new generation

Grab some weed, grab my engineer, hit the studio
And tell that nigga that we staying for weeks
My album on the way nigga get ready
I feel like the rap game waiting on me
Hustle hard as I run the distance
Praying for my little brother with a son that listen
My mind lives on more than one dimension
It's a problem not a issue, you gon' learn the difference
Whatever my nigga I'm solid
I'm kicking back kicking my knowledge
We bounce like hydraulics (Bounce bounce bounce)
Give it to them while they novice
So they can accept and allow it
Everybody want to be on
Couldn't find another me with a drone
You can try all you want, fly in the sky all you want
Taking blunts to the dome
Paying four double O for an ounce with the bro
Making sure the family tree stay strong
'Cause when them branches stop falling
These niggas start renting it and talking and acting like hoes
Don't act like these hoes
I ain't afraid of no man
That's not how I'm programmed

Dizzy Wright,"Yeah, early 2014 I was on the Knock Madness tour
I was mad about it, I half-assed my album cause I really didn't know what I was rapping for
I was going through a break up and that was hard
I wasn't in my right mind, nigga that's for sure
Every night I was praying and I would ask the Lord
To please give me strength, so I don't slam the door on my fans
But no luck I was stuck
Even though a nigga had a plus size buzz
I didn't even know who the fuck I was
I tried so hard to see a plus side, but
I couldn't find the spark inside the dark
Even with my crew saying nice remarks
It felt like some darts were stuck inside my heart
I was thinking that a brand new life's the start
But I couldn't leave, I made a commitment
On my off time the fans invaded my business
So I started feeling a gang of resentment
Flipping on everybody when they ain't even did shit
I needed to go home and gather my thoughts
I didn't wanna suicide as the result
So the night at my Fort Collins show before I hit the stage
I left through the back for a walk and no one saw
I thought I was going up to the store to get a drink or somethin'
And a voice had told me to keep walking
And do not step foot on that stage for nothing
So I kept on walking
Then I camped out up in an abandoned house
I hated this rap shit and I hated my life
The spotlight does that when you can't get out

Cause I been on this road, tryna get high from my low
Won't somebody tell me where to go, please cause I don't know
I might be crazy, living life like a circus ape that's strapped into a car seat

Here is a secret, you don't have to keep it between you and I
Upcoming rappers who 'bout to be touring, I promise the road will eat you alive

And by no surprise, I'm not gon' feed into the lies
No, I'm not gon' say that you wrong
But I'm not gon' say that you right, it's hard to keep quiet
When all I do is hold you down
If I ain't know you then, well I feel like I know you now
I know you had a little doubt, but to hop off stage and find out
You done walked out, and you not taking nobody calls
You don't wanna deal with it
But I'm looking at these fans like damn there's a lot of y'all
You got me tripping with the bodyguard
Like ""Nigga, how the fuck you lose the headliner?""
Now I don't care that you left the show
I just wish you woulda let me know
Cause I don't know if you've been kidnapped
Or know somebody from the city where they live at
But, the way you went about it make it hard for me to feel bad
Honestly it made a nigga real mad
Cause I'm texting you like Hop the devil just testing you
When Fort Collins got respect for you
And that's why the next day, you was like

Like it, or love it, I'm rushing, I'm busting
My enemies better get sick
Five-O, I am on the grind, fuck is on your mind
Here I'm talking, but I ain't got time, my girl left, but that's fine
Nobody’s tripping, you made the decision
Wait 'til I catch the new nigga slipping
Thought I told you shit now is different
I pop a matic, get itching, look
Holding it steady, ready, let me get loose
This is something I do daily
Too many people going crazy, zany
Losing their minds, so I strap on my safety, yup
I burn this shit down
You see where I'm going, so now you start to come around
Fuck you, you had your shot
Now sit back and witness, I climb to the top, bitch
Shut the fuck up, I'm paranoid and I'm buzzing
My homies now, I can't trust them
Betrayal's now the new custom
The pain is deep, but I'm accustomed
At the end of the day, I still love them
No space for hate in my heart, that can wait in the dark
Funk Volume, we coming, hallelujah

Bitch, we got it popping, nigga, hallelujah
I woke up feeling great, nigga, hallelujah
Came up out the dumps, nigga, hallelujah
You know we getting to it, nigga, hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah
Came up out the dumps, nigga, halleluja, hallelujah, hallelujah
Y'all don't want these boys to bring them problems to ya

Dizzy Wright,"Man this is god's poetry, vibe and roll with me, rocking all on this beat
I used to complain about not having shoes, until I seen a man with no feet
Now I feel rich
Money don't make me who I am I never looked down on someone that need a lift
Kindness is a gift
Kinda can smell success, I'm just, I'm just trying to get a whiff
You could say that I'm glad that I had me a childhood (Why's that?)
'Cause now I'm living out my dreams
Nowadays kids not even living they life, they just staring in they iPhone screens
By any means necessary
Rhyming all that's left in you
Better love the ones next to you
I see a lot of young niggas looking for a sex symbol
Technology is taking over
Feed off these real vibes as you make it older
Young soldier, we all gotta grow
And when you think that you got life figured all out, you realize how much you don't know
Look, after Moms threw me out on the curb
Back when the vibes was louder than words
Yo, I told myself I was gon' get it and god is my witness
My focus was how to be heard
Now I'm here, I see the smiles and tears
I hope this live for a thousand years (It will)
True leaders create more leaders, so tell them haters they ain't never gonna be allowed in here
'Cause we characterize (We characterize)
People by actions I see when I stare in your eyes
Forever surprised (Why)
See, everything better whenever I'm high
Break it down

I wanna let out all my frustrations
But I ask myself can I feel this way
Ay, ay, ay, ay (Ay, ay, ay)
Can I feel this way?
Is it wrong that I feel this way?
Can I feel this way?
Because

Look, I don't know y'all trying to be
I'm creating my dynasty
Inspire these kids every time I speak (Yo)
I guess they believing us
Like Martin when they tried to black out the black folks and white America mistreated us
My momma said ""too bad they needed us""
It's only one race and that's the human race
So that's what I plan to teach my kids
Respond to these fools with silence
As I'm giving y'all the growing process
You can tell me what's next
I ain't heard nothing like it
(How you gon' remember me?)
From living in positive energy without ever having a doubt?
Or praying for my enemies, [?] by the hate
'Cause I ain't never take the easy way out
S'till I pray
Can I feel this way, Lord tell me can I feel this way
Real man always trying to make a play, just a thought
Got me working at my craft every day
[?]
W-w-w-wake up, get right, look in the mirror and I hope you see yourself
I honestly don't want you to be like me
I wanna, inspire you to go and be yourself
We call that love and awareness
The shit that you get for free but don't cherish
Y-you have a beautiful soul, it's no reason to be so embarassed
'Cause we just gon' characterize
These people by actions I see when I stare in your eyes
Forever surprised
See, everything better whenever I'm high
And right now",Can I Feel This Way,2015
Dizzy Wright,"You create your own globe
But we can't force the growth
Don't care about what they think baby you got this under control
You take on life and I watch, growing up and I accept that
This kind of love don't stop, we need each other but how can I stress that?
There's some things in life, that won't be right and won't add up
But don't try to be what they like, we all have bad days and bad luck
But don't forget you can call on your old man, don't forget you can call on your old man
I'm here whenever you need me, through hard times everything's gonna be all fine
'Cause you got me and I got you, (You always got my love)

Everything I did for me I built for you (I built for you)

For y'all to take it and run with it
And turn it into some shit that it's not

Yo, exceeded my expectations a while ago
They wondering why Dizzy the one that's always smiling for
I listen a lot and look at everything I done accomplished, mane
S'till, my baby girl and son is the main thing that I value most
Family, fuck a xanny, I'm puffing on this flower though
You piece of shit, no thang, we keep it lit
No hard feelings, don't ever change, don't ever quit
When I found out living legends s'till exist, I knew I had to commit
So I heard that this new generation was waiting on me
After The Golden Age, these old heads been praying for me
To get involved, maybe vent to y'all, and make an impact
Better plant a seed and water that bitch and watch it grow
Now how many times I gotta say it? I been down and out
But you only get so many chances 'till you're fouling out
And I'm like, let me live without taking no breaths
My mind is focused on which task I'm finna take on next, uh
I think back when I just hung with my dawgs
My mama could never keep a man 'cause we was running him off
Needed a father figure but I don't like how he coming across
He end up gone, she was sad but I felt like that's his loss
I told her, never bend your head, look the world straight in the eyes
You deserve love, but a queen don't need a king to survive
And it's a blessing to be able to rap and not feed y'all lies
Or fake my happiness like everything's just fine
I mean, we all human beings but we not alike
'cause the loudest on the Internet get to sleep through a quiet night
It's a big difference and it's teaching me a lot about who we are, how like
Money don't change people, it just bring out who they truly are
Man, I done seen the most from coast to coast
They got us crossing over the border line
I don't got all the answers but we need to be more organized
So here's a little enlightening for your peace of mind
Everything you need in this life you live will come at the perfect time
So God bless America

In God we trust
Born in royalty, they can't take that from us
No matter what, runs through our blood
We have the power, we just like to trust (Trust)
Just have your faith and believe
Keep calm, my young kings and queens
Watch and you'll see, and when that day comes
May God bless America

Uh, follow me, follow me through the hardships
Pardon my need to be swift with how I start this speech
Who you more like? Malcolm or Martin?
The game that they play with us, brother, don't have no cartridge
Button mashers, disaster casters, they ass backwards
I might slave for a meal but you ain't my master
Running through the field, all I hear is laughter
'cause them chains that kept us here can no longer capture
The heart of my folk, foot on my the throat of my oppressor
For all of them ropes, they tied a tree for my ancestors
If limbs could talk, they'd cry for days
Sad, they gave all they had but couldn't break under pressure
Blood on the leaves, Glock on the dresser
Them laws plotting, protect and serve but I know better
The news a lie, to you and I, TV ain't real
So don't you try, to be like none of them Housewives
Selling us fools' gold
Tell a son to slang dope and daughter twerk when they get old
Damn shame, how we find time to sit around
Smoking and dranking, while they corporate banging
Don't be content with the hood, nigga, what is you thinking?
I got a small violin if you don't vote for complaining
About the government, stand up on some brother shit
And stop being on some other shit, God bless America

Despite all the barriers
If you do whatever you do every day
You can get it, I did it

From the poorest, they said I gotta push for all my dreams and they flourished
Then a forest full of obstacles, I got the dope 'cause I'm morest
Don't ignore it, that I built this vocab without a thesaurus
When the war is pressing, they be asking me questions like Katie Couric
Like, ""Did you sell dope when you fell broke?""
Tryna stop a male's hope who never dropped the jail soap
Made it up out of Hell's scope, they ask, can I spell vote?
I'm feeling like they tryna tell jokes, ya pale rope
I'm a U.S. citizen escaping the penitentiary they hid us in
The kid has been fitted to quit and then spit it and shit again
But I became noble and well-rounded like an oval
Never will I be grounded for disposal
Everybody be astounded by the mogul, Tech N9ne
No more saying, I can't afford this
Even when I was down, my plan was to never abort this
Don't forget, they said I sold my soul, that's horse shit
'cause I simply thought my way onto the Forbes list
So God bless America",God Bless America,2015

If it don’t make you feel good why you applauding it
From Vegas tryna get to the point where I’m Marley Marl-ing it
Take me back to the days in the past
My older brother’s getting in trouble, I was saving his ass
Headed to gym class
Baby almost made me late
I’m tryna squeeze in them thighs
She tried make me wait
Can’t front like the early 2000’s wasn’t the days
When Allen Iverson made everybody wanna wear braids
Young and reckless
And I’m stuck in my ways
I’m 24 and all I wanna do is smoke and get laid
I’m talking no fucks given
You notice the ones who talk and gossip the most, you have no trust in ‘em
1990 J’s with the skinny’s tucked in 'em
Retro soul with the henny cup with him
Oh, yeah that’s me with the two-step
In the party, in my own world, not givin a fuck who left
Dancing the night away
With a soul with a smile that gon’ make a brighter day (oh yeah!)
Now I’m feeding off the positive vibes
I’m not gonna lie
When everybody think they know me, they gon' have to assume
(So what we doing)
Twisting doobies in the back of the room
And where I’m at for what I’m actually doing
So let me ask y'all

I don’t know how y'all feel about me

Real is something that these niggas can’t take from me
Call it what you want, but I know what it is
But you better watch what you say to me
Play no games ‘specially if you not family
I wanna live in a country that’s pot friendly
One love and positive vibrations
Blessed with a mind that take me to wild places
Give that to y'all
Let y'all run with it
Come get it, if you’re down feed off that
Not involved with a lot of things that take me off track
But if you love it then I need your back
Talk to 'em

I don’t know how y'all feel about me
But can you feel the good vibes (hell yeah) Can you feel the good vibes
(Hell yeah) Can you feel the good vibes
(Hell yeah) Can you feel the good vibes
(Hell yea)

I don’t know how y'all feel about me
But can you feel the good vibes (hell yeah) Can you feel the good vibes
(Hell yeah) Can you feel the good vibes

I heard they praised me for being real, but I don’t see the support
Fell in love with changing lives and chose that over a sport
Could’ve been anything in life and yet I’m out here on tour
Like some day we gonna get bored and we gon' want more
Pretty much prepping myself
For the fans that finna get ahead of they self
When they act like they know everything about me
And all the niggas that doubt me
Come outta nowhere and start criticizing all proudly
Like “hold on nigga, where the fuck was ya’ll at?”
Buggin out on me, nigga fuckin' now, homie
Some days I can feel Hopsin’s energy rubbin’ off on me
Cause the love don’t feel real if the talent is only a skill
It’s unrealistic to think that one day we won’t make a mistake
But who am I to say, it’s probably from never taking a break
Finding pleasure in poetry, guitar strings and a bass
Uh, my life ain’t been the same while on the run
When these kids say “fuck a message, we just wanna have fun”
Now I move to the beat that confused me for weeks
While ya’ll hands high, my head high like hold on nigga you lost me
Then I looked at my Youtube views, and I got salty
Cause I realised my real shit don’t get that much love
I see exactly how ya’ll do ya’ll favourite rappers
Favorite musicians, athletes, actress, actors
Spreading anything without it being the truth
I guess to tarnish someones image these days is the thing to do
But when you stop judging the music
And you decide you wanna judge me on the way I live my life
Cause I’m a celebrity and you can
Don’t be surprised if my response to the negative shit
Is telling you to “suck my dick”
I’m a grown ass man
Grew up strong enough to deal with all these so called fans
My momma say I got thick skin
My daddy say they’ll never really understand our struggle as kids
Until the end, build off small wins, now here I am

Dizzy Wright,"I guess my time has finally come, and it's amazing
Sitting in the back of my tour bus, smoked out, just blazing
Can't be broke forever, hell nah
So close that I could taste it
Pulling up to the venue with a loud pack already waiting
Let me knock this sound check out
(Light the weed when I step out)
Funk Volume we the best out
When it comes to all around artistry (right, right, right)
Making beats send them straight to me
And I'm riding to them like y'all
Then I write to 'em, hit the studio
Just me and all of my dogs
I ain't breaking no laws (nah)
Keep it cool everybody know me (everybody know me)
Got my marijuana card still won't explain that to the police (never)
Stay away from them cuffs (cuffs)
Keep weed enough I can tuck
I'm not the weed man, I don't sell weed
'Cause it's not a nigga I trust (I trust)
So I'm buying fifty-six grams
Just to break the homie off with some nugs
It's peace and love, and I don't need
None my niggas go and get stoned (stoned)
I know life ain't easy
Holding shit down on your own (own)
I clearly see that you feeling down
So here's something that'll take you up
And have you in the clouds my nigga

I can tell you needed it
It's peace and love my nigga, go and get stoned
I can tell you needed it
It'll make you feel right when everything feels wrong

I can tell you needed it
It's peace and love my nigga, go and get stoned
I can tell you needed it
It'll make you feel right when everything feels wrong

Uh
I can tell you needed weed from the king himself
Illadelph, bong hits, let the bubble melt
If these packs don't sell, I'll send 'em in the mail
These cops killing young kids, let 'em burn in hell
Free the weed, more love, need it in the streets
How I hate Billboard and this industry
The radio don't play me and, I don't even care
My core fan base made, me a millionaire (true)
Frisco blew and, Johnny Walker blew (blew)
In a town car thinking, daydreaming
But its really true (it is)
All this cash that I'm counting
House in a mountain
Two green houses and a water fountain (Scarface)
Three girlfriends, they all hate each other (come on now)
Can't we all, get along, and hang together? (trust me)
Trust me it would be much sweeter if we get it right
All my girls in one room just acting tight (smoking)

It's peace and love my nigga, go and get stoned

'Cause when your stashing up with no cash flow
Don't worry bout it (Don't worry bout it)
You can slide through
I'm finna clean the rig and then sterilize it
We still verbalizing it's a damn shame I ain't bigger now
But look i made enough to at least to help all my niggas out
Every month we get weed provided
Smoking that Dizzy OG and I'm getting excited
Makes me want to spread love, nigga why the fuck is ya'll fighting?
Why the fuck is ya'll complaining about who the nicest?
Now everybody coming to my shows and wanna smoke and hold up their devices
Look, ya'll should just enjoy the vibe
Close your eyes and just enjoy the vibe
They say there's more to life than weed
I tell them I'm more than fine
Low temp dabs, no blowing, puffing on no hookah sticks
Hitting up Logic like ""hit up my celly when you feeling buried alive""
(Puff puff then pass)
When you make up your mind hit my line
'Cause these other niggas be lying, they shit trash
We new and improved, puffin a doob, chilling with uncle Bern
With some sexy girls
That don't roll weed but they all wanna learn, like

Making music videos with the cannon
Didn't know nothing, did everything low budget
But we had real love for it (Love for it)
And that was where it started
Man life is crazy and I hate the way I saw it
So i did it, little nigglet was legally blind
Build up my confidence
Do anything I set on my mind
'Cause I was taught you won't get nowhere with a negative mind
They show love and I respond man the pleasure is mine

No struggle, no strength

I'm looking around (Round)

But that can't be cloned (Cloned)

Screaming who am I
A humble king until I'm crucified
But I'm not here to try and make it about me
Do or die now watching another friend commit suicide
'Cause even at her bravest she was feeling afraid to leave
I mean long walks and good talks and therapy
May not never be enough but shit its a start to a better me
And I'm not tryna tell you how to live your life

To Vegas if I ain't a legend then I'm the closest
And I just wanna be real with yall
Maybe share my creative ideas with yall and build with yall
But yall just gon downplay the boy like you don't hear it
Can't be cautious creative thinkers must be fearless
That's some good advice but when you presented yo big idea how they gon feel it
I say we go make my million dollars look like 10 million

But I just wanna sleep in a cali king and have safe sex on it
Travel the world doin what I love so I can get a paycheck for it

Cuz half of the time half of these niggas don't even know what they're supporting
If you want the life then I'm warning ya
These fans could say that they love you and turn into babies without they're formula
Crying to get attention homie yo expectations hella low
What happened to being yourself yall see me and act like yall met a ghost
How you gon handle the lifestyle knowing damn well you ain't got no self control

So I'm doing everything in my power to make this last
I made mistakes in the past but today I hope my branches grow
The more money I receive the more the more my people gon learn what I'm standing for
Focus on how my brand should grow they demanding more
Haters hate but they standards low
I'm just trying to balance out what I'm rappin about

Too much at a time the next you know they tappin out
I was spazzing out, homie said put down them blacks and smoke this half an ounce
And before you bounce make sure they fuck with your meaning
You too understandable these rappers can't fuck with your English
Started thinking maybe I should spaz less switched up my address
Coming in peace I'm here to inform educate and provide some access
Will it last until my last breath, maybe past death
If you hear my voice just know that I'm never gon half step, but ask yourself

Cause a woman of the year was Caitlyn Jenner
That's disrespectful, I'm offended
A man is a man, even after the image
Wait, you can't tell me this world ain't confusing!
Drugs got niggas dealing with it, do you niggas even pay attention?
What are you rap niggas doing?
That ain't cool
The struggle remind me of the starving days
Most people fail by only focusing on the starting phase
Too bad they don't teach us that in school
Cash advances, no overdraw fees to damage with the funding
You could start a business, but can you run it?
Don't waste your life chasing money

Tell them this the shit that we deal with
But I can't deal with it no more
Trying to get ahead
Since he heard her give birth and raise the dead
I mean them
This the shit that we deal with
But I can't deal with it no more (no more)
Life's getting tough, I don't know (don't know)
Don't lose control of your soul
Tell them this the shit that we deal with
Tell them this the shit that we deal with
Tell them this the shit that we deal with
Tell them this the shit that we deal with

Thanks for checking out man
I know a lot of y'all are going through tough times
Some of ya'll, some of y'all
But I'm hear to remind y'all to be kind to each other
To love yourself
Love yourself enough to focus on you
You know this wisdom and good vibes tape is for y'all to take with y'all on y'all journey to
You know, excellence
Life is going through challenges and trials and them
We got to overcome them in every way
So, keep your head high

Dizzy Wright,"Yo, you know when the timing is perfect
Pull up a connected dots and be conscious with every purchase
I'm, fully in service you seen it coming this engine running
Feel like I'm getting younger, but I'm no Benjamin Button
Tossing and turning I know I'm not laying here for nothing
Shucking my thoughts like concussion, rushing, bottom buzzing hope you hear me
Reminiscing on the days when my pockets was empty
Twenty years and I bet they could see my father in me I'm
Painting his picture, learning his life that was given 
For the ones that wasn't with him we still learning the system man
They don't give a damn, be a failure like your father
Life is fucked up, why you trynna make it harder?
Let me be! How far you thinking ahead?
Well it depends how much I'm making and how much I'm gon' spend
Preach! Nah don't preach, don't speak, don't repeat
Loving yourself is the only relief
No dealing with negative people, grab your phone and delete
Tone it down, make a point, then they hit you with the run around
So what dumb it lower take it lower than the underground
Niggas see me, they just need to hear me when I come around
I still feel like I ain't shown my full potential yet
Let the instrumental play so I can let my mental flex
Motivated, bad passes getting intercepted see me getting started
Working harder, I ain't finished yet

While the whole world getting trippy
I was different, definitely psychedelic like Jimmy

Empire numbers so we travel from the winter to the Sydney Australian summers
I'm truly blessed for the silent moments, I need 'em
Haters always get ignored, silent treatment's how we treat 'em
And I don't wanna waste no energy no more
On another niggas flaws
I mind my business and let karma do it's job
My personality will never let me be no fraud
Telling myself y'all couldn't handle all of my deepest thoughts
Hypnotizing light it, man it's satisfying
Get your highest while you thinking let your fingers write it
How excited, life's your journey better be your pilot
Niggas flying over water when they landing get indicted
Fuck what these people think, they be on it
Life's passing better enjoy it, your passionate moments
Sadly the new deepest text is mackin', fakin' and hoein'
Small talking in the open, and overheard how you growing, keep my thoughts in an envelope
Before I put 'em in the post
Seen the most and we be too focused on the instant emotion
Can't complain, I'm learning from it
Negativity and we ain't gaining nothing from it so my mind is up to something, feel like I

Couple niggas hating on me, don't be emotional
Y'all was sleeping, it was noticeable
Now me and the greats going toe to toe
Causing trouble, fuck a motto
Where the focus is, results will follow come tomorrow
Heard that hope would get a nigga killed
So every day we go a lil' harder

Go a lil a harder, work a lil harder
Work a lil harder, go a lil harder
Go a lil harder, work a lil harder

Like ""Damn, home girl - you done made it out""
""There ain't no need to be slaving now""

I should be the vice president right beside to Bernie
Having conversations with my attorney
So all that fuck shit don't concern me

Got some stoner bitches, no relation
Bitch you tryna get saved
I'm Ty Dolla $ign with the saving

Just in case I'm always staying dedicated
Discipline over desperation

(Oh Major, don't go)

Word on the streets is some labels showing some interest
I'm ready to take off like I'm in the fuckin' Olympics
All about winning I'm Jordan back in '95 and 6
I wanna get wealthy, if you not gonna help me then mind your biz
Oh, what I prefer is for my city to say that ""the time was his""
And yes I'm referring to me
Headed for a early degree
Out high school to the league
Not for money for me
Know I'm in a comfortable space
Are you willing to pick up the pace?
I told my OG, ""With all the travel what's the hassle?""
He told me, ""What you rap about is only half the battle""
Admit it, don't build your castle and let your family straggle
I'm livid, money got less value than my fuckin' shadow
You niggas better free your mind, better free your fuckin' minds
I'm always right on time and y'all ain't ever dropped a dime
It's fine, not gon' be salty or be sour
Ahead of fools like the time jumped up an hour

Yo I been lookin' at my family tree and shit
I'm branched down off some crazy ass shit
But you know I see positive potential in my life (Oh Major, don't go)
All I could do is smile and think about what I've already overcome 
With my mama with my brothers and my sisters
It's hard for y'all to tell me anything at this point (Oh Major, don't go)

Word on the streets is that the streets need a new hero
From ground zero, me, Demik, Reezy and Euros
When it's time to cut the check we gotta keep that love and respect
Not lettin' no one fuck me over or make me fuckin' stress
Nigga where your daily hustle?
Don't make it a situation
If you wanna speak on the shit you thinkin', you better articulate it
From Flint to Vegas, I'm out here still tryna keep it legit
Dealin' with a domino effect
The shit leadin' to similar events
So I keep a team with sense
In my defense we do not attract niggas that's gon' pretend
Y'all better get with it, eliminating all the hate and the critics
Committed, putting Vegas on the map, and who gon' say that he didn't
Coming with the vision and I'm ready
Everything I gotta earn
Now I'm feelin' like a expert
All I wanna do is learn
Steve Jobs with the net worth
Only comin' with the max shit
This is me, I had to go and get in tune
Twistin' them Fanta leaves gettin' high just to find the truth

Nothing can come between you and your destiny
You and your greatness
Only you can stop you

You don't gotta lean on nothin' to be great
Lean on your motherfucking mind
Lean on your conscience, lean on the fact that you can go find that knowledge yourself

And what you see will be
Rhymes that keep their secrets
Will unfold behind the clouds
And there upon a rainbow
Is the answer to a never ending story

Neverending story
Oh, oh, oh

Look at what you see
In her face
The mirror of your dreams

In your hand
The birth of a new day

Will unfold behind the clouds
There upon the rainbow

DJ Acucrack,"We have been worthless,
We have been safe,
In minds belittled by the threat,
Of our own ice age.

A fall distorts us,
And where we've been,
Rewriting bastards as contenders
Sight unseen,
In place of angels,
Butchers hands,
Too wide to fit through
Doors of virtue,
Blame, demand.

Blame and demand.

We count for distance,
From human nerves,
We count for all the things we take,
That we don't deserve,
All contradictions
Will make us stand
To fake the end as the beginning
Blame, demand.

Blame and demand.",Blame and Demand,2004
DJ Aktive,"Last night I had a dream
Of a beautiful day
And like a song
An angel passed my way
She was the embodiment of perfection
With skin like the sky
And her hair was as long as time
Then she turned to me (yeah)
With her big proud eyes
Her voice flowed like water
And it brought a tear to my eye
And she said to me

Oh you've come

Uhh..
Sittin in a over crowded tank
I'm tryna see which nigga these niggaz plotin to get, uhh
Cause if it's me, it's on
Loc, the Esse wit the black knights just got stoned
And then he fell to the ground
Plus, his homie's ain't around so he better get a beat down
It's not a jack for his scratch or his shoes
It's life in the county and the county gives plenty blues
One point for the black guys
They rolled him up, swelled and belled
and left him with two black guys
He still alive so he know what's next
Any nigga they catch lookin they gon' put him to rest
So I made my best to protect my chest
On point all night cause if I sleep I might
Not make it in this world of fools
I might come up missin if I'm slippin in these County Blues

[Chorus]
Niggaz fuck around in they County Blues
You might come up missin, if you snooze you lose
You confused the fuckin system, when you need I be
Why? Cause it's a steady rainology

But hold up, you gotta take a trip upstairs
What are fools always wonderin?

[Snoop Dogg]
I be ""God damn nigga, what'chu gon' do?""
Stay down for yo grits cause he who slips, gets, lick
and stuck, fucked and all that
Boy when you get out you betta not never come back
I tell you that'll make a punk hard
Put him on a killer row, where the killers kill and disregard
Say you don't gang-bang
Well why your homie - baby boo callin you by ya gang name? (Sup nigga?)
Uhh, later that night, a whole 'nother fight
But it's aiight, cause it's a nigga and a white
But damn, the Esse's is deep
And it look like they strait tryna creep, you peep?
Creep like T-L, on the D-L
But you fail, tryna tell Dabbity Bell
Well, that shit was disrespectful, nigga
You ran out on the brotha's
That's what'chu got checked for, and deck for
Nigga you'se a hoe (you'se a hoe)
Uhh, and I'ma let you know (let you know)
I mean, niggaz is bitches, when they get behind the wall
But I ain't talkin 'bout all why'all
Cause I know some niggaz from the see-P-T
and some big homie's from the L-be	-see and South Central
Niggaz why'all know, why'all is the looniest

If you're feeling lucky duck then press your luck
I snatch fake gangster MCs and make 'em faggot flambé
Your nine spray, my mind spray
Malignant mist that'll leave comp defunkt
The result's your remains stuffed in a car trunk
You couldn't come to the jungles of the East popping that yang
You won't survive get live catching wreck is our thing
I don't gang bang or shoot out bang bang
The relentless lyrics the only dope I slang
I'm a true master you can check my credentials
Cause I choose to use my infinite potential
Got a freaky, freaky, freaky freaky flow
Control the mic like Fidel Castro locked Cuba
So deep that you can't scuba dive
My jive's origin is unknown like the Jubas
I've accumulated honeys all across the map
Cause I'd rather bust a nut than bust a cap
In your back in fact my rap snaps your sacroilliac
I'm the mack so I don't need to tote a Mac
My attack is purely mental and its nature's not hate
It's meant to wake ya up out of your brainwashed state
Stagnate nonsense, for if you persist
You'll get your snotbox bust you press up on this
I flip, hoes dip, none of the real niggas skip
You don't know enough math to count the mics that I've ripped
Peep the Dirty Rotten scamp as his verbal weapons spit

Oh-oh! Heads up cause we're dropping some shit!

Real, rough and rugged, shine like a gold nugget
Every time I pick up the microphone I drug it
Unplug it on chumps with the gangster babble
Leave your nines at home and bring your skills to the battle
You're rattling on and on and ain't saying nothing
That's why you got snuffed when you bumped heads with Dirty Rotten
Have you forgotten, I'll tap your jaw
I also kick like kung fu flicks by Run Run Shaw
Made frauds bleed every time I g'd
Cause I've perfected my drunken style like Sam Seed
Pseudo psychos, I play like Michael Jackson
When I'm busting ass and breaking backs
Inhale the putrified aroma
Breathe too deep and you'll wind up coma
Toast the king I'm hard like a fifth of vodka
And bring your clique cause I'm a hard rock knocker
I gotcha out on a limb about to push you off the plank
Let you draw your chronz but your burner shot blanks
When the East is in the house you should come equipped

Oh-oh! Heads up cause we're dropping some shit!

Fly like a jet, sting like a hornet
Knuckleheads get live and set it off if you want it
Dirty Rotten Scoundrels is crushing fools no joke
With styles more fatal than second hand smoke
Don't provoke the wrath of this rhyme inventor
Cause I blow up spots like the World Trade Center
Come with the super trooper on his assault mission
The tek's technique cause he's a technician
Wishing he'll go away won't help the weapons stop
The skills are shot cause any idiot can let off a Glock
Hard rock smelling the clutch of the sun toucher
You claim you got beef on the streets, so what ya
Gonna do when real niggas roll up on you
And you don't got your crew
Pull your Glock but you don't got the heart
You was webbed straight from the start
Bought a tool and didn't learn how to use it
Got lost in Brooklyn so you had to lose it

Waiting for that little brown eyed girl 
She's coming back 
I gotta hear that whistle blowing 
Down the line 
Come back girl 
She'll be mine, oh mine

Why did you grieve me?

DJ Andy Smith,"Misty morning, clouds in the sky
Without warning, the wizard walks by
Casting his shadow, weaving his spell
Funny clothes, tinkling bell

Never talking
Just keeps walking
spreading his magic

Evil power disappears
Demons worry when the wizard is near
He turns tears into joy
Everyone's happy when the wizard walks by

Never talking
Just keeps walking
spreading his magic

Sun is shining, clouds have gone by
All the people give a happy sigh
He has passed by, giving his sign
Left all the people feeling so fine

Never talking
Just keeps walking
spreading his magic",The Wizard,2006

Authority must be maintained
And then we know exactly where we are
Let them feel that they're important to the cause
But let them know that they are fighting for their homes
Just be sure that they're contributing their all
Give the scum a gun and make the bugger fight
And be sure to have deserters shot on sight

And I'll catch you when you fall
Back in love with me again

I'll get back on my feet again

You gave me wings so that I could fly
And your love has made my heart aware
And I can feel it getting stronger

You've taken off all my armor, now my heart's exposed
You've got the key to unlock your love and let it go
I've got a one way ticket, there won't be no turning round
And I can't wait to get my two feet on the ground

DJ Babu,"An open microphone can be dangerous
Let's tune in on two of the greatest MC's out there

(Chorus)
[Rakaa, Gift of Gab]
Passion
The will to win, the spark within
Passion
The strength within the hearts of men
Passion
The drive to press, to strive for best, to rise
You've just arrived the quest is driven through
Passion
To play through pain and love the game
Passion
To break the chain and blaze the flame
Passion
The fight for rights to love your life, to rise
You've just arrived the quest is driven through
Passion

[Rakaa]
Propaganda, positive propositions
Politician, musician and a triple optician
Still part of my missions to slaughter the opposition
Critics that don't get it, I tell 'em to stop bitchin'
I do without blacks, I've done it without cash
Strictly for the love of the art - that's passion
Flashin', rappin' or jammin' or soundblastin'
When Quannum meets Expansion, this is what happens

[Gift of Gab]
Runnin' through the jungle with a flare gun
Arrow-arms, zoning out my mind
Like I was hooked on hero-ine
Take the fire, turn it up and blaze whole forest down
Pullin from within' the inner insane warrior
California to the District of Columbia
Hella high octane, lookin' through a lazy eye
All ablaze, fire, flames, lightin' up the sky
Runnin' through the burnin' sun, yellin'
Ride, nigga ride, nigga ride..

(Chorus)

[Rakaa]
Desire, the fire that inspires
I don't state facts, I state buildings, like empires
Passion
The journey, the learnin', the time-turnin'
The searchin', the mind yearnin' to wake and find morning
Passion
The ladies they love the long-lasting
Asking for action, braced for satisfaction
 

[Gift of Gab]
Passion
The black-skinned African jazz-men of the half in Aspen
Relaxed, gettin' my back rubbed

[Rakaa]
I'm still here, I've seen cats get killed here
I've seen cats make a mil but millionaires still fear
You can buy airplanes but you can't buy cheers
Blackalicious, Dilated, vibratin' your ears

[Gift of Gab]
Sent vibrations for years, I've been waiting for years
I've been patient for years, we ain't playin' this year
We hold stake in this here, it ain't safe for this year
We in the zone watch next level, takin' it there, this is

(Chorus)

Babu!
Let's listen to this recipe for-
Chief Xcel-
The most astonishing-
Soul-
New seeds of wisdom, craft, and skill
(Check it out, y'all)
Listen now, to this classic moment from-
DJ's, around the world, DJ's around the world

[Gift of Gab]
Had a rough week, it got beat by passion
Saddled up, tweaked off a beat, started mashin'
Matador Rica, the heat from the heater
In her world, dwellin', hear the world
Yellin' for a leader

[Rakaa]
I don't bother with the dealers, I take it to the lab
It's Rakaa chillin' with Babs, Xcel, Gift of Gab
I grab mics and fans gravitate, I can't waste it
My whole life, I wanted it so bad, I could taste it

(Chorus)",Passion,2002
DJ Babu,"Sometimes, sometimes, sometimes, sometimes....

Hybrid
I've been diggin in crates ever since I was livin in space
Before the rat race, before monkeys had human traits
I mastered numerology, big band theology, performed lobotomies with telekinetic psychology
Invented the mic to so I can start blessin it
Chin-checkin' kids to make my point like an impressionist
Many men have tried to shake us
But I twist mic chords like double helixes to show them what I'm made of
I buckle knees like leg braces,
Cast a spell of instrumentalist on all of you MC's who hate us
So you can try on, leave you without a shoulder to cry on
From now to infinity, let icons be bygones
I fire bombs, ghostly notes haunt this
I tried threats, but moved on to a promise
I stomp shit with or without an accomplice
And run the gauntlet with whoever that wants this

High voltage
The unforgettable sound
High voltage
Bringin you up and takin you down
High voltage
Comin at you from every side
High voltage
Making the rhythm and rhyme collide

Akira, I've put a kink in the backbones, of clones, with microphones
Never satisfied my rhyme jones
Spraying bright day over what you might say
My blood types krylon, Technicolor type A
On highways ripe with road rage
Cages a win, cages a tin, that bounce all around
Surround sound
Devouring the scenes
Subliminal gangrene paintings, over all the same things
Sing songs karaoke copy bullshit
Break bones verbally with sticks and stones tactics
Fourth dimension, compact convention
Write rhymes with ease while the track stands at attention
Meant to put you away, with the pencil
Pistol, official, sixteen line, a rhyme missile
While you risk your all
I pick out at your flaws
Spittin' rah blah, blah, blah you can say you saw

High voltage
The unforgettable sound
High voltage
Bringin you up and takin you down
High voltage
Comin at you from every side
High voltage
Making the rhythm and rhyme collide

High voltage
The unforgettable sound
High voltage
Bringin you up and takin you down
High voltage
Comin at you from every side
High voltage
Making the rhythm and rhyme collide

Who's the man, demanding you hand over your Land Rover
The man's bolder than the Pharoahe when he jams you glance over
I am visclorosous, the most ferocious
When I spy my third eye, it's extremely high voltage

That's why I need ruby quartz glasses,
'Cause when I glance there's a chance
That I might blast the masses
Subliminals transmitted through piano
Integrated in flow, calculated to nano

I use skills when I need pleas sees the rhyme
I hear when I bleed as I proceed through time
I walk through walls and the inanimate obstacles
By inducing the reduction of cells and molecules

I bring the knowledge the you swallow a state that's a hologram
I botch your head, fatten your lip like collagen
The telepath deliver verses with no postage
Pharoahe Monch, Mike Shinoda, we are high voltage

High voltage
The unforgettable sound
High voltage
Bringin you up and takin you down
High voltage
Comin at you from every side
High voltage
Making the rhythm and rhyme collide

High voltage
The unforgettable sound
High voltage
Bringin you up and takin' you down
High voltage
Comin at you from every side
High voltage
Making the rhythm and rhyme collide

DJ Babu,"[Chorus Cuts: DJ Babu:]
Just too hot to touch
Just too hot to touch I got what you want

[Madchild:]
Although I plan to go out with a bang not a whimper
I still gotta watch my temper
Watch over both shoulders cause of what I'm into
Sometimes I get emotional cause of what I've been through
It goes..
Anger, anger, that's one of my hangups
You don't wanna rock and roll kid, your head gets banged up
Feel tension, blood starts pumpin
My friends always win in the fights, I still jump in
And I don't have a drinking problem
I drink, talk shit, fall down no problem
When I drink its a problem, cause I cause problems
Cold hearted, man I'm so robotic
Not like you forgot but I'm slightly psychotic
I'm here to terrorize the world
And fuck the minds up of you boys and girls

[Chorus Cuts]

[Prevail:]
Complete sweep like a cluster bomb
Cold as death, hold your breath till the dust is gone
>From the lost angel city to the gotham skyline
We're still public access but watch us go primetime
I'm Cannonball Crush, not Cane or Able
I reign like Charlamain and just as fatal
Even worse, I'm not vain or narcissistic
Preach like an arch bishop from the darkest district
In the killing field planting seeds of dissent
Fast fascinating demons flashing dreams of contempt
Come on, self contained I'm my own metropolis
Go against the grain for the throne of the populace
Kingdoms I want em, hand em over, relinquish
Or I'll douse them in flames that you'll never extinguish
My right hand writes in sequential order
Eventually I'll make you lifespan potentially shorter

[Chorus Cuts]

[Madchild:]
I'm Fuckin with em....
Did so much dirt can't rinse the filth
Wealthy but concerned with my mental health
Hope to got to heaven but I've been through hell
Think I'm going crazy man please don't tell
Cops hate me they want to throw me in jail
Hate to think if they got me alone in a cell
I'm pretty sure it wouldn't go so well
Cause ain't nobody coming when you yell for help

[Prevail:]
We're the fast and elite
What else, the young and the vigorous
You should probably keep your distance
Cause my hunger is hideous
Tell affiliates and friends there's no need to defend
When the warriors descend is where the story will end
Were ageless and timeless, your faceless and spineless
So let us lead the way while they follow in blindness

[Chorus Cuts]

And all heads turned 'cause she was the dream
In the blink of an eye I knew her number and her name yeah
Ah she said I was the tiger she wanted to tame

Caribbean queen
Now we're sharing the same dream
And our hearts they beat as one
No more love on the run

I lose my cool when she steps in the room
And I get so excited just from her perfume
Electric eyes that you can't ignore
And passion burns you like never before

Just running my game
Love was the furthest
Furthest from my mind

Til she finally did it
Overworked but I'm still committed
All things under the letter G, Snoop Dogg done did it
Gracefully gazing into the sky
A lot of people smoke just to get by
But I see things much differently
Medically, physically, mentally, theoretically
Put it in a letter so you let it be

Only put it in the paper
I just started recently letting niggas smoke blunts around me
Known to keep the room cloudy
Get a bad bitch, sit her down, let her smoke, now she open
The best trees I be smoking
Smell it through the bag so it's potent
Even get it on the plane, TSA don't even notice
Ran in the burner, he done taught a young nigga how to grow it
A pothead but I be focused

A work sore hand to catch some rain
It turns up empty, all is dry
And all you ever wanted was some rain
Was some rain

If heaven is the future
Why is it that that you refuse to go
There now with all you have
You really should do more than just complain
Just complain

Such a rotten taste
Is left when you don't think to say that
It's just such a sorry waste
To take the easy way out of the pain
Of the pain

When the end shines from the deep
And all the hate and all the hell that history has released
Would tremble before your valor if you'd
Just get down on your knees
And promise to all your children true
That you will live in peace

Where's the light to shine on me
Oh, send me something, send me please

All excitement, nothing plain
Keep you happy, that's my aim

All da homies think I'm trippin' 'cause I got you a pad, but see
They just mad 'cause they ain't get you, they ain't get you
Scorpio is yo' sign and girl you're so fine
And I would do whatever in no time, no shine (Let me hold you)

It's what your coming with, but I'ma change all that
Rearrange that, put you in the Range, all black
With the rims to match, phone attached, TVs in the back
How you gon' say no to that, huh? (Let me hold you)
Niggas look at me like, ""Man, here you go
Really 'bout to blow some dough""
Ain't nobody did before, so why is you so gone

I didn't mean it
When I said I didn't love you, so
I should have held on tight
I never shoulda let you go
I didn't know nothing
I was stupid, I was foolish
I was lying to myself
I could not fathom that I would ever
Be without your love
Never imagined I'd be
Sitting here beside myself
'Cause I didn't know you
'Cause I didn't know me
But I thought I knew everything
I never felt

The feeling that I'm feeling
Now that I don't hear your voice
Or have your touch and kiss your lips
'Cause I don't have a choice
Oh, what I wouldn't give
To have you lying by my side
Right here, cause baby
(We belong together)

When you left I lost a part of me
It's still so hard to believe
Come back baby, please
'Cause we belong together

Who's gonna talk to me on the phone

Who's gonna take your place

Bobby Womack's on the radio
Saying to me
""If you think you're lonely now""
Wait a minute
This is too deep (too deep)
I gotta change the station
So I turn the dial
Trying to catch a break
And then I hear Babyface
I only think of you
And it's breaking my heart
I'm trying to keep it together
But I'm falling apart

I'm feeling all out of my element
I'm throwing things, crying
Trying to figure out
Where the hell I went wrong
The pain reflected in this song
It ain't even half of what
I'm feeling inside
I need you
Need you back in my life, baby

When you left I lost a part of me
It's still so hard to believe
Come back baby, please

It's the people's champ, I'm something like a baller
The candy paint dripping off of the old school Impala
I'm with that Big Bank Hank, that Poppi Joe and Box
Trunk bump like chicken pox, turn the bass up just a notch
You see them blades choppin', you see that trunk poppin'
Ho's that diss me in the club, the same ho's in the parking lot boppin'
They see me in the Jag, acting bad with T Ferris
Open mouth and showcase ice, and you gon' see about 20 karats
I'm what they do, you on 5-9 double O
In the Tahoe on 24's, I'm the truth, I got that glow
I'm out that Swisha House with Archie Lee and Couda Bang
Sittin' sideways on swang, the candy paint dripping off the frame
You see me acting bad, I'm showing out and pulling stunts
Say cheese and show my fronts, it's more carrots/karats than Bugs Bunny's lunch
It's Paul Wall baby, I got it made

Slanging licks on the grind, putting money in my socks
A legend in the hood for gold grills and poppin' seals
A icon on the mic for showcasing my verbal skills
I'm in the club posted up with some gang bangers
Still flipping the old school candy Cadillac on swangers
I got a Styrofoam white cup full of that drank
Looking for that dank, my hustle game sharp as a shank
Big bank take little bank, 84's and candy paint
Trying to find some ""Honey Love"" my macking game is top rank
These ho's peeping me, ill hustling on the side
Eavesdropping my conversation, trying to figure which car I drive
I'm on the scene strapped up like I was bungee jumping
Hit the corner you hear me bumping
Look at that cold grill and woman
The trunks popped up, my music screwed and chopped

Heads up when you see us, we gon' put it in ya face
Raised on Scott and Yellow, when I blaze...
Boys smell lemon haze, I ain't the nigga to settle
I'm that dude with the metal, that get hot as a kettle
From messing 'round with some cat that ain't got it together
Flossing, breaking off the intersection, crossing

All invisible set with little ice cube blocks
If I could call it a drink, call it a smile on the rocks
If I could call out a price, let's say I call out a lot
I got like platinum and white gold, traditional gold
I'm changing girlls everyday, like Jay change clothes
I might be grilled out nicely (oh) In my white tee (oh)
Or on South Beach (oh) in my wife B
VVS studded, you can tell when they cut it
You see my grandmama hate it, but my lil' mama love it
Cause when I

Open up ya mouth, ya grill gleamin' (say what)
Eyes stay low from the cheifin' (cheifin')

I got a grill they call penny candy, you know what that means

I got the diamonds and the ice all hand set
I might cause a cold front if I take a deep breath
My teeth gleaming like I'm chewing on aluminum foil
Smiling showing off my diamonds sipping on some potent oil
I put my money where my mouth is and bought a grill
Twenty carats thirty stacks let 'em know I'm so for real
My motivation is from thirty pointers, VVS
The furniture my mouth piece simply symbolize success
I got the wrist wear and neck wear that's captivating
But its what smile that's got these onlookers spectating
My mouth piece simply certified a total package
Open up my mouth and you see more carrots than a salad
My teeth are mind blowing giving everybody chills
Call me George Foreman cause I'm selling everybody grills

Lights gon' hit and make you woozy in your head
You can catch me in my 2 short drop
Mouth got colors like a Fruit Loop box

It's what it do, in the Lou'
Ice grill, country grammar
Where the hustlers move bricks
And the gangsters bang hammers
Where I got 'em you can spot 'em
On the top, on the bottom
Gotta bill in my mouth like I'm Hillary Rodham

I ain't dissing nobody but lets bring it to the light
Gipp was the first with my mouth bright white
Yeah these hoes can't focus cause they eyesight blurry
Tipping on some 4's you can see my mouth jewelry

One white, one yellow, like Fabolous chain
And the other set the same got my name in the mold

DJ Black,"Ay Yo, welcome to the world of S-H-O-are-T
Texas where them trill ass niggaz be livin naughty
Rollin up ho's like turtles in half a shell
Open up my trunk and let's see what I have to sell

I got the dope, if you ho's got the paper
And if you a faker then you'll meet your fuckin maker
'Cause I ain't takin no shit on my cuts
The UGK posse got the big big nuts

Yo, so who's a bold bitch?
Try to make a sale
You betta bail
Before they find you in a ditch

This dope ain't yo dope
And these cuts and yo cuts
Yo, but this is my 12 gauge in yo muthafuckin guts
Don't make me pump this bitch and unload
Get yo feet muthafucka, hit the muthafuckin road

And don't even try to come back nigga yo
Cause me Dre and see got fingers on a fat trigger

We makin too much money movin weight
And before you hit my cuts, you better get your shit straight
'Cause it ain't safe to just try and show yo ass up
Street sweeper boomin cold blow yo ass up

And ain't nobody scared to blast
We pull them triggers fast
And then we bailin on yo bitch ass

But if yo shit is legit, then you can join my crew
U.S.T. graduating class of '92 in Short Texas

Niggaz on the track droppin shit about TX
As long as there's fiends that's them tax free dope checks
Young muthafuckas at the age of 16
Cookin up some llello for the local drug king

The market's not open so they call it closed circuit
Short Short Texas watch them hard thugs work it
5-0's on the scene make the all time drug bust
Out next week slangin some more white dust

Real, oh so triil, the life's no glamour
At the end of my time is spent in a slammer
Fuckin up shit with the 9 inch chrome
So all you scary got-it-good young-ass bitches stay home

And if you get picked up by the laws
Don't cry cause it's for a lost cause
Clientele ounce of llello, in jail make bail
From longs to short, it's constant dope sales

Stupid muthafuckas smokin dummies and noids in jail
On U.S.T., Crack University
Home of the Fightin' Fiends, the streets reimburse me
Cops findin my stash, yo what could the worst be

Through so goin undercover then turnin dirty
Bitch, I'm dead and swole in a ditch
Just the other day, a fiend in your Lexus
Callin my name Blue Light, I'm Short Texas

I don't give a fuck who you be
You ain't bout to sell no fuckin dope in P.A.T.
You could be Tony Montana in this bitch
Have a boat load of dope, but you still ain't sellin shit

Cause we don't know your face so I don't really figure
We gon let you come up and sell dope in Texas nigga
See you don't understand, it's our muthafuckin cuts
So step in, like I said before, we'll take them muthafuckin nuts

Ask the last nigga brought his fuckin ass down
Tryin to sell that fuckin dope he bought in H-Town
Couldn't sell in Houston, so I guess he figured
I'mma go to Port Arthur and run them fuckin niggaz

Brought his fuckin gun, guess he shoulda bust
So they took his shit and put his dick in the dust
Stupid ass nigga had the nerve to come back
Rollin on the cuts in his white Cadillac

Got to the block and the guns just exploded
Shot his car up with the 9, end of clip the clip that he unloaded
Sent the nigga home to his momma like a ho
They jacked all his money and they stole all his dope

Can't be trill in the villa of the trillest
Cause where I'm from nigga house some muthafuckin killas
So have your shit attached, before you come check us
Pimp see, bitch, P.A. home, Short Texas",Short Texas Outrolude,2006

When I was 16 0r 17 my mama looked at me she say
""Boosie, son, get on yo motherfuckin' shit nigga"". 

Big money I like it. 
Used to have hoes who triflin', 
Now I got pros, who dikin', 
And its exciting, its exciting. 

I had to get my shit together mayne, I didn't like it. 
I had too many hoes, who triflin'. 
Dirty shell toes, and Nikes. 
I didn't like it, it wouldn't exciting. 
Till I got money, I got icey and hoes got right, they got feisty. 
Turk to put me in the studio, I kept writing. 
Droppin' that gangsta shit, and its exciting. 
Purple after purple, mayne, we kept lightin'. 
Concert after concert mayne we kept fighting. 
We struck tha' world real quick, like lightning. 
You pussy ass rap niggas, stop biting. 
I used to fuck wit lil' girls wit lil' minds who wouldn't grown yet, 
Before you wear a thong get yo pussy in check. 
Yo hygiene a motherfucker you 'sposed to stay smellin' right, 
Especially if you got a nigga wit money,
That's wat he like.

Money make yo life betta so fuck what they say. 
Girls be wanna ""G"" up every time they look in yo face. 
She used to kiss me on my neck. (uh huh)
Now she suck me till that pussy get wet. (uh huh) 
I remember way back when I used to fuck plats, 
When wore them daisy dukes and had that pussy sittin' fat. 
Now a nigga gettin' stacks, I do whatever I like. 
I hit em Asian, Black, or White. I have my pleasure wit dykes. 
I'm first class on every flight. I'm a big dog nigga. 
At tha' super bowl on the front row. Where is ya'll niggas, look. 
I used to fuck wit hoes who like to cut
Yo tires up. Now I'm breaded and they can't even get a nut.

Rims all shiny, dressed nicely. 
Hoes wit tha' white tee, fresh white G-Nikes. 
White 2 seat, or I might be new SUV, doing 90. 
Lookin' for tha right weed, for tha right fee. 
Hit it once or twice my eyes tightening. 
I go faster, I swerve slightly to the left of the lane I came back right. 
Grab that clutch tightly 'cause it might be my night, 
You know we got niggas dying nightly. 
Tonight I'm wit a nice freak. She half white, 
She clean up, lick a nigga nuts 'cause she like me. 
Finding another me up in the streets is unlikely. 
Don't hit me on the phone later on 'cause I might be gone.

Wanna thank em
I'm stressin' cause the things I did
Not wearin a rubber got me stuck now with three kids
This shit is real
Wish I had a real friend to holla

Cause she might be leavin' anyday

The judge tryin' to send me to the pen
And give me ten
And do me in

He visto con mis propios ojos lo que ocurre en la tierra
Viendo como tanta gente se muere en las guerras
Jalan gatillos sin importar las consecuencias
Baja tu arma, ya es tiempo de crear conciencia

So, cuantos se han multiplicado mis adversarios
Muchos a diario se levantan contra mi
Yaow, tu me has librao' del gatillo y de la muerte
Y por tu voluntad hoy estoy aquí
Solo existe un Dios en el cielo y en la tierra
Aunque no de la guerra, donde a muchos matan y entierran
O encierran si otro confiesa

Después botar la llave y sin derecho que por vida lo ingresan
Para el vivo es un misterio si después de cementerio
Va a el infierno, lago de fuego y de azufre
Donde to' las almas sufren, castigo eterno
Cuando se apagan las luces en el día de juicio
Ambición, una de las profesas
Asesinato, traición, aquí ya no se fía

Haga lo que haga, en nadie confía
Ni os vi crecer y ahora están matando si a plena luz del día
Sangre fría por su rebeldía, sentimiento de venganza
Que les la alegría
Solo aquí gobierna el pirata de las almas
Baja tu arma, pronto será el tiempo que reina la calma

He visto con mis propios ojos lo que ocurre en la tierra
Viendo como tanta gente se muere en las guerras
Jalan gatillos sin importar las consecuencias
Baja tu arma, ya es tiempo de crear conciencia
So, me ahogo en la melancolía y con dolor pasan los días
Vidas vacías van en busca de alegría

Victimas de guerra mueren por la maldita hipocresía
Los que ponen a caminar por la vía y la fantasía
Ambición, billetes, envidia, y las balas mano
Pueden cambiar una persona en un sucio gusano
Odio, traición, y rencor apoya la sangre
Sal pa' la calle, y sobrevivo de muerte, hambre

En que la multitud se pierde en tinieblas

Hold a dream against the wind

Shadows of the night
They are coming when the moon is shining bright
Leave their graves as shadows of the night
When the city is asleep

Silent cowls are shadows of the night

A wolf is howling on a distant rock
It's time - for the silent slaves
Waking up to open their graves

One, two, then three and four
Grave by grave more and more
Commemoration of transmutation
Traces - of a lost generation

The shadows of the night have never died
Unsatisfied
They paid the highest price
Waiting - for another advice

Never found final peace
Their restless life will never cease
When the moon is shining bright
They leave their graves as shadows of the night

The shadows of the night are on their flight
Never saw the light
Silent strangers slow and fast
Without future without past

Flying through the streets of an endless town
The way to nowhere up and down
People locked the doors of their floors
Shadows are fast like a flying horse

A short attack, like a maniac
Confused by the ghost in black

Cause you're the only one, the one and only
I need you in the heat of the night
Come quick, I wanna hold you tight
Could you feel I need you
When you're in my arms all my dreams come true
When you're gone I feel weak

Just bad creation of mine

Black rain is all that I see
Black rain colours the sand
Too fast I don't understand
False prophets talking about our life our destiny
Rain forest still alive sounds like a joke an irony
The air smells dirty we can all see pollution
To heal the world is not a game or an illusion
We see the world hunger not enough to eat
We close our eyes walking through the lonely streets
Strange disease there's nothing there's no cure
Cancer aids and much more we know for sure
Should we stay or run away
That's the price we have to pay
And then before we fade to grey
The message is love
The message is love
Should we stay or run away
That's the price we have to pay
And then before we fade to grey
The message is love
The message is love
Sometimes we get angry there's no focus in our life
When people get hungry they gonna learn how to survive
Homeless people concealed in the street
With no hopes and no dreams with no shoes for their feet
How many guns they have to melt they have to burn
Return to good sense when will we ever learn
Fighting this freedom for everyone for you and me
I know that this world is the place for us to be
Black rain made out of steam
Black rain to the extreme
Black rain what can we do
Too fast a nightmare comes true
Should we stay or run away
That's the price we have to pay
And then before we fade to grey
The message is love
The message is love
Should we stay or run away
That's the price we have to pay
And then before we fade to grey
The message is love
The message is love
The message is love
They've got drugs for children sniff to be free
They've got so much corruption this is all what I can see
Respect yourself you don't need that pack of crack
You only live once and you're not coming back
Spread your arms against the wall you're not to small
That's all to call who's next in the line to fall
This world is in motion runs faster and faster
We pray for a wind of change don't want that disaster
Should we stay or run away
That's the price we have to pay
And then before we fade to grey
The message is love
The message is love
Should we stay or run away
That's the price we have to pay
And then before we fade to grey
The message is love
The message is love
Rain forest can survive rain forest save our life
If there's a wind of change the message is love
Protect the seven seas protect the helpless trees
We need the wind of change the message is love
Should we stay or run away
That's the price we have to pay
And then before we fade to grey

Should we stay or run away

Scorn my born,

I've got the music in me 

I've got the music in me, deep in me 
And I'll never feel alone 
I've got the music in me, deep in me 
Let it goin' on and on 

On our mission to no man's land 
We followed the traces in the sand to a 
Land, never seen before 
Without mountains and valleys and lakes without shores 
All my friends disappeared 
Being alone that's all they feared 
Transformed by a metamorphosis 
A matter of time and I'll be like this 
In the dark there's shining an invisible 
Light, cold and bright through the night 
Made by an enemy or made by a friend 
What does it mean, I can't understand 
The drums are calling boom, boom, boom 
I'm ready to rumble, when the fight resumes 
Left alone on my own, I'm 
Captured in a danger zone 

Hundreds of voices in the deep dark night 
Searching for a light, avoiding the fight 
I feel there is someone else beside me 
Around the tree, mysteriously 
Time is running fast, I'm the last of the past, 
Time is running fast, I'm the last 
I hear the ticking of a bomb inside my head 
Tic tac, tic tac waiting for the big attack 
I'm the last survivor of the expedition 
Of a mission, into a no man's land 
Like explorers, like strangers 
We saw shades of a dwarf but didn't see the danger 
Surrounded by a groove I was hypnotised 
Tried to run away but my feet didn't move 
Left alone on my own, I'm 
Captured in a danger zone

Stars in the sky shining bright see the light 
Forget about the problems for one day in your life 
With your wife, your family, your friends and in harmony 
Let's come together help the sad and lonely through 
It could be me or you so what we gonna do 
Come and take my hand, let me understand 
Welcome to the Christmas land 

Merry Christmas, merry Christmas 
Feel the power of the silent night 
Merry Christmas, merry Christmas 
See the guiding star is shining so bright 
Oh oh oho 
We're celebrating Christmas 
Come and join the party of love 
Oh oh oho 
We're celebrating Christmas 
See the stars are shining above 

Who wants to spend Christmas time alone 
At home on your own sitting next to the phone 
Waiting for someone who's calling tonight 
To hold you tight, let the stars shine bright 
Feel the spirit, the power of love 
These emotional moments and the sky above 
Friends are together celebrating hand in hand 
Welcome to the Christmas land

DJ Bobo,"Return to silence 
We need no violence 
Fighting for freedom in a restless world 
We are praying for peace 
Without pain and disease 
Heal the world and close your eyes 
Return to silence 

Return to silence 
We need no violence 
Fighting for freedom 
Return to silence 
Praying for peace 
Pain and disease 

Where is a real paradise 
Where is the land without lies 
We just have to find a better way 
The loss of heaven is the price we pay 
No more nightmares each and every day 

We don't need any wars 
People wanna change course 
They want the union of love 
Where's a heavenly place 
For the whole human race 
Without weapons and wars 

Every being on earth, needs a dream in his soul 
We need our freedom, let loose of control 
The older we get the less we see our way 
We think of the past, but now we are trapped 
And if I want to know why, we are trying to deny 
The loss of heaven's road, is the price we have to pay 
Stop violence, let's come to one's sense 
Return to innocence 

Somewhere inside, we still feel to be a child 
Where the eyes are big and the problems being mild 
If we try to go against, the current of events 
Sometimes we gonna loose but we have to take the chance 
Always have in mind, things should change in peace 
Searching for someone to help, the sad and lonely trough 
It can be me or you, so what we gonna do 
I have a clue, for me and for you

I'm born in this world, in the entire space
Planet earth is my home, is my face
Follow your trace, embrace this human race
In case, there's a new decade in human history
I'm talking about respect, this is my destiny
Feel free and stop running away
From the doubt in your mind-never fade to grey
Dreams can make you fly
This world is magic
Rainbows in the sky
This world is magic to me
Dreams can make you fly
This world is magic
We need peace on earth
The second birth of paradise
Planet earth, gentle and blue
Then cold as a rock, or ice without a hue
Planet earth made out of dust
A big ball of metal, condemned to rust
Pray, let your soul be free
Find out how to heal a bleeding wound, don't stand around
Life could be paradise, peace on earth is what I found
All around in a magic world from the air to the ground

DJ Bobo,"I have a dream, I have a vision
You may say it's an illusion
Together we are strong
Let's give peace a chance
Tell me what will be tomorrow
Will we find a road to follow
I still believe in love
Let's give peace a chance

Now I feel like I'm stranded
But I'm not the only one
Light the fire and give peace a chance
It's a wonderful world
Let`s see it, believe in it
For tomorrow, let's give peace a chance

I tell you, now wake up or be swayed by my dream now
A world of hope and peace, I'm trying anyhow
Most of us only care about money making
And that's for real - the thought of it is aching
Facing everyone with an open heart
We better going to start before our worlds apart
No matter where you from - no matter who you are
No matter what you do - the pain has gone to far
There's a falling star, please achieve my dream
Peace for the world and try and grow your self-esteem
To resort to violence means hate and frustration
Coming back stronger then your own imagination
Power and money shouldn`t be the temptation
But shouldn`t be love our best motivation
I still can't believe this is true, right here, right now - I haven't got a clue

Whatever happens in your life you've got another chance
To advance yourself, grow and give a better glance
Tolerance between religions and races
Let's talk about respect between different faces
We all are the same at the end of the day
Rich or poor we have to fade away
And if you`re black or white – doesn't matter anyway
Hindu, Muslims, Christians, they all just pray
For freedom and a world of peace and harmony
Lord I'm so confused about this living human tragedy
Tell me what is wrong, - tell me what is right
Tell me why are people still suffering and fight
People hear me - it's time to wake up and love
Before it's to late let us all free the dove
I still can't believe this is true, right here, right now - I haven't got a clue

Is this what life was meant to be
Sometimes we lose reality
But then I'm reaching for the stars
And I know, and I know

I have a dream, I have a vision
You may say it's an illusion
Together we are strong
Let's give peace a chance
Tell me what will be tomorrow
Will we find a road to follow
I still believe in love
Let's give peace a chance

Now I feel like I'm stranded
But I'm not the only one
Light the fire and give peace a chance
It's a wonderful world
Let`s see it, believe in it
For tomorrow, let's give peace a chance",Give Peace a Chance,1998

I'm gonna miss you so much if you go.
And, Hey, Girl! I tell you  no lie,
Something deep inside of me's going to die,
if you say so long, if this is goodbye. Oh!

Hey, Girl! This can't be true,
How am I supposed to exist without you?

Without a smile in their faces how can they survive ?
It's a dangerous world they are living in
Between imagination and expectations
On their way to the point of no return
They only live once and they have to learn
Your life is too brief to waste your time for hate
It's never too late to celebrate.

Can you feel it?Can you feel it,
What it means to hold a hand?
I've been around the world!
Can you feel it?Can you feel it,
What it means to hold a hand?

If you need a hand,You can find a friend
In every nation of this world,
If you need a hand,You can find a friend
In every nation of this world,
Rap 1:
I've been around the world, saw the desert and the rainbow -I go for the show from the sand to the snow,
From Moscow to Manila, from Milano to Beijing,
Caracas to Cape Town and back to Montreal,
Stop running every day from the pain; say no, go!
Driving you insane, no shame that you want let show -
Call my name; I feel the same when ou have sorrow!
Grow, let it go! There it always be a tomorrow.
Rap 2:
All around the world when you need a friend;
I'll be there, anywhere, don't care with a helping hand,
Understand one another 'til the end,
I swear; I'm fair, I care always gonna be there -Black, white, yellow,
No matter if you're young or old;
All for one, one for all -That's what my mother told me!
Different colours and faces, find the traceTo your embrace this human race;
Life, will flows like a waterfall -I've been around the world, saw the desert and the rainbow!
Rap 3:
I've been around the world, saw the desert and the rainbow,
I go for the show from the sand to the snow!
From New York to Paris, Sao Paulo to London,
Sydney to Munich and back to Jakarta,
Hug and unforgettable China!
Peoples ( are ) so open, much more as I expected - Invincible pleasure in Brazil ( Samba ),
Fond of life - there was no time to chill!!
I've been around the world, a thousand times for sure,
Could be more explore?
Before you walk through that door.

Life's a castle on a raining sandy beach,
All your hopes and dreams so far beyond your reach,
Climb the highest mountains, swim the deepest sea,
Free is, what I wanna be, see the key - count on me,
No jealousy, eternally; the family is, what you need!...........

You made us feel like we could fly

The trouble's gone, here I am to blame
Can you hear me now, I am calling your name
How could I be so mean to you
Please let me know, what I can do
I feel ashamed, I was such a fool
Hope its not too late, I was trying to be cool

It's hard to say I'm sorry, I regret
I didn't mean to hurt you
It's hard to say I'm sorry, please forgive
I'm still in love with you
It's hard to say I'm sorry

I want your love
I want your heart
Oh, let me tell you I'm sorry
I want your love
I want your heart
Oh, let me tell you I'm sorry

Since you've been gone, I feel alone
I miss your smile, I'm on my own
I'm calling you, just to hear your voice
You are hurt deep inside, I'm not one of these boys
Where do I go, without your love
Don't wanna stop, it's not enough
One more chance, we can make it right
Hope it's not too late, cause I swallowed my foolish pride

The words of mine had been so bad
I didn't wanna make you sad
The trouble's gone, here I am to blame
Can you hear me now, I am calling your name

",Let the Party Begin,2001
DJ Bobo,"This is the story of a star
He gave up reality for fame
He's the man in the mirror

Money was his best friend
Lludadi dadida
Lights are off, the curtains closed
No one is here now
Ludadi dadida
To turn back the hands of time

he's the man, in the dark
Trying to see the light again
He's the man, in the dark
To fall is hard to understand

He's the man in the mirror
He was a hero, he was a superstar
He's the man in the mirror
Searching the spotlight, Searching a fame bizarre

He's the man in the mirror
Ludadi dadida
He's living inside a nasty world
No one was honest
Ludadi dadida

Searching for the fame he lost
He's the man in the mirror
He was a hero, he was a superstar
He's the man in the mirror
Searching the spotlight, Searching the fame bizarre

The curtain is closed
The camera is off
The make up is washed away
He's looking in the mirror
Trying to find his inner self
The real world is waiting
He's so afraid to be alone

Time is getting over
Ludadi dadida
The past is running through his hands
No one is waiting
Ludadi dadida
The show is over he's alone

When I'm all alone in Moscow

I am hurt so deep inside don't make me cry 
Tell me why, tell me why oh tell me why 
Live in love with you was just a lie 

Another night why do I believe 
Life could be like before 
You ran away said I have to leave 
And then you walked out that door 

Time will heal, I'm alive 
Broken wings need to fly let me try 
Time will heal, I will rise 
And then I close my eyes 

Another day I'm feeling alone 
I don't know what to do 
I can't believe our love has gone 
You don't know what I've been through 

Tell me why, tell me why 
The day we met I've learned to fly 
Tell me why, tell me why 
To live with you was just a lie 

I'm lonely, hope you feel the same pain too 
You walked out that door, the next rendezvous 
For you, I was the name of the game 
Insane, I feel like the man in the rain,

And naked, there's no way to your heart

Everyday, I feel your love slip away 
If you don't feel the same, tell me the truth
I hope you never go cause girl you gotta 
Believe if you do
That my heart will be lonely for you

I only care about you and me I don't want you to pretend;
About the feelings you have for me cause I heard it from your friends

But when I try to hold you and squeeze you you're pushing me away

Telling me you will be late and in the end you never show
Is this the beginning of the way you say goodbye 
Girl I want to hold you and squeeze you and beg you not to go 

If you gotta go the you'd best let me know
I'll accept if you need to be free
Oh its all I can say I won't beg you to stay
See this man needs his dignity (ooh baby)

We'll never part you can start this love 
Once again don't let our love slip away come on girl stay night and day, find out, 
Who's right who's wrong, and what's going on my heart is empty when you're gone
You came into my life, you set me free you made it brighter so that I could see,

All the good things have been taken
But girl there are ways to make certain things pay
Though I'm dressed in these rags, I'll wear sable some day

I'm gonna ride the serpent
No more time spent sweatin' rent
Hear my command
I'm breakin' loose, it ain't no use
Holdin' me down, stick around

But baby (baby)
Remember (remember)
It's my life and I'll do what I want
It's my mind and I'll think what I want
Show me I'm wrong, hurt me sometime
But some day I'll treat you real fine

There'll be women and their fortunes
Who just want to mother orphans
Are you gonna cry, when I'm squeezin' the rye
Takin' all I can get, no regrets
When I, openly lie
And leave only money
Believe me honey, that money
Can you believe, I ain't no saint
No complaints
So girl go out
Hand it out

DJ Bobo,"I hear a lot of stories, I suppose they could be true
All about love and what it can do for you
High is the risk of striking out, the risk of getting hurt
And still I have so much to learn

Well I know 'cause I think about it all the time
I know that real love is hard to find

And a good heart these days is hard to find
True love, the lasting kind
A good heart these days is hard to find
So please be gentle with this heart of mine

My expectations may be high, I blame it on my youth
Soon enough I'll learn the painful truth
I'll face it like a fighter then boast how I've grown
Anything is better than being alone

Well I know 'cause I learn a little every day
I know 'cause I listen when the experts say that

That a good heart these days is hard to find
True love, the lasting kind
A good heart these days is hard to find
So please be gentle with this heart of mine

As I reflect on all my childhood dreams
My ideas of love weren't as foolish as they seemed
If I don't start looking now I'll be left behind
And a good heart these days, it's hard to find

I know, it's a dream I'm willing to defend
I know it will be worth it in the end

A good heart these days is hard to find
True love, the lasting kind
A good heart these days is hard to find
So please be gentle with this heart of mine

A good heart these days is hard to find
True love, the lasting kind
A good heart these days is hard to find

Trapped twice as bananas with no chorus.

In the hood like catalytic converters.

Watch me clap to this!

We went from niggas to porch monkeys, to negroes, to blacks, back to niggas again.
Yet niggas is still hungry.
Abolish the N-word, the plan's so corny.
While homeland security cams are all on me.

They watch through the fiber optics.
It dawned on me that cops can just run in your spot quick without warning.
They educate the masses to follow, it's so boring.
I sat in the back of the classes, asleep snoring.

And they ask me why I'm vocal and animate
'Cause I lost my focus like governer Patterson.
And the ghetto is impossible to escape.
And the first obstacle is this tapeworm in my abdomen.

Spear-Chucker fuck that, I tossed javelins and $5,000 bills in the face of James Madison.
This is an American post mortem, to focus on your bogus NOVUS ORDO SECLORUM, clap!

Watch me clap to this!
Now everybody watch me clap! Clap!

No respect, no manners, it's Mad Max with multiple max.
Mad banana clips, and a black hammer that hits the back of a black talon.
Slew a hallow tips to the wall of your blue silence
And selective theatrics, collective dramatics.

I'm systematically pissed, clap automatic for me and Abu Jamal
Maybe I'm... peace are fanatics for peace, but ain't got a pacifist.
The Gospel, I spit it like Jesus of Nazareth and then infaticly clap.

And the guy who's comin' to see her.
Just beyond the highway
Lies an open plain
And it keeps me goin'
Through the wind and rain.

Yeah nigga, we know hip hop and rap
And all that shit started in the motherfuckin' East

Know I'm sayin'? Then it went to the West coast
And they did it a little bit better
Know I'm sayin'? But now it's our time
To shine down here nigga

Know I'm sayin'? So since y'all niggaz keep sayin'
We ain't real hip hop down here
We don't wanna be down with you bitch ass niggaz

So y'all stay up there with that bullshit
This country rap tunes down here nigga
Young Pimp, Young Bun, Underground Kingz

All the O.G.'s that's recognizin' the real
I got love for y'all but all you bitch ass niggaz
Talkin' down in ya records, you can eat a dick
Hold up

Pushin' cocaine, servin' pounds of weed
Steady stayin' on the grind
Pussy nigga can't say he ain't hatin' me
Because if you did, then you wouldn't be lyin'

But how in the hell am I supposed to respect the man?
That talk down on every song
You steady actin' like a bitch, you steady cryin' your eyes out
Say my name pussy nigga, we can get the shit on, on, ooh yeah

Quit hatin' the South, baby
We gettin' paper in the South, gettin' money
Quit hatin' the South, baby
Quit hatin' the South

Well, it's been a long time my nigga, I shouldn't have left you
When I some real trill shit to go left to
Gotta lot of respect fool, for the ones before me
But when my time came they act like they ain't know me

I've been down with rap music since Cold Crush and Melle
Before MTV put Run-D.M.C. on the tele
Back when Whodini tried to tell ya about ya friends
Nigga I was givin' rap all my time and my ends

Bought damn near every record the motherfucker dropped
West coast gangsta music, East coast hip hop
Now it's our time to shine and the tables is turned
Them motherfuckers aggravated 'cause we gettin' some burn

There's no room for everybody, just a few niggaz is swole
Probably 'cause they favorite rappers ain't in control
But just let go of the past 'cause it's hurtin' your hands
And pass it over to the next generation of fans

And quit hatin' the South, baby
We gettin' paper in the South, getting' money
Quit hatin' the South, baby
Quit hatin' the South

I'm blastin' off on you hoes like NASA
You double standards and hypocrisy remind me of Massa
We ain't good enough to eat at ya table but when ya dick get hard
You wanna run up with [Incomprehensible]

I from the get coke but I'm still clockin' figures
Bitch hoe cock suckin' nigga
And that goes for all you visitors too
If you don't like it down here, get the fuck on fool

They say you can't rap and they questionin' our intellect
Friendly ass niggaz jumpin' bad on the Internet
Ain't nobody typin' that much can't be a danger
Catch you in person, bitch I'll break yo' fingers

It's some trash in the South but I promise you
From the East to the West, some of y'all garbage too
As long as the beat knock and the lyrics hot, son
I can give a rat's ass where a rap is from

I remember N.W.A. and PE
Had me feelin' like a rapper was the thing to be
You can't fuck with Willie D, UGK either
Disrespectin' the code, does motherfuckers neither

Quit hatin' the South, baby
We gettin' paper in the South, gettin' money

To all the radio, TV and even the press
Been hatin' on the Sizz-outh like we ain't impress
Y'all think we came in the place, say man we came in the state
Y'all shoulda listened to Andre, bitch we got somethin' to say

And all you washed up rappers, you ain't what it's about
I see y'all tryin' rap like us and puttin' grills in ya mouth
Y'all buy the beat, buy the beat like y'all bouncin' and twerkin'
But hoe we know what's goin' on and bitch that bullshit ain't workin'

I'ma O.G. Rock Ball, write my name up on the wall
Fuck yo' bitch and hit the switch and put my dick up in her jaw
I'm Sweet Jones, fucked a clone, legend on the microphone
Player's choice, silver Royce, keep yo' bitch's pussy moist

I'm bumped the school, that's how I do, sippin' drank, each teen night
In Benz, big blue lens, knock this bitch and fuck with her friend
Candy cart, squeeze 'em out, bought the ranch man fuck the house
And y'all still gotta buy y'all dope from us
So what the fuck you bitch niggaz talkin' 'bout?

All you ole sensitive ass niggaz, know I'm talkin' 'bout?
Y'all niggaz on y'all period up there bitch
Know I'm talkin' 'bout? y'all hide behind them e-mail addresses
Sendin' that bullshit through the air

Bitch, say my name bitch, I'ma come to ya house
Fuck how you feel, country rap tunes nigga
They put all y'all records on one side of the store
And put all the country rap music on the other side of the store
And see who sell out first

Bitch ass nigga, it's ya own fault ya shit ain't sellin'
You reap what you sew and fuck you in ya pussy
Keep talkin' that shit

Think I've found a way for you and I to finally fly free.

When we get there, we're gonna fly so far away,
Making sure to laugh; while we experience anti-gravity.

Or should I hold my head up high
And throw a wrench in spokes by
Leaving the air behind me clear?

Uh
The streets of my city be gritty
Young niggaz pack plenty, and ain't never show no pity
Many die on streets of concrete, blasted from the heat
From under the seat, niggaz just tryin' to make ends meat
Trying to eat, day to day livin' with no religion
Luxury cars, and this money got my full attention
School teachers and the preachers don't know what to teach us
They don't get a second look without them ghetto features
Created so the non pigmentated rated
Pornographic caught they children learn the words and say it
Save the monsters, but don't nobody know the lord
Status depends on the baddest shit you can afford
And look at me I'm in the middle of the confusion
Crime in my blood and I need a transfusion
Take it how you want to take it
I gotta twist and break it
Make it shine to distinguish from the ones who fake it
and if it comes out raw, and uncontrollable
Money's foldable, fuck a hip-hop quoteable
Nobody felt what I was feeling when I wrote this shit
Broke this shit, but that ain't new so I can cope with this
Hope it get better for those who don't get a chance
To advance, and dig the shit I be saying
You know what might make what I say a little clearer
If mothafuckers judge the one they see in the mirror

I want ya'll to play this at funerals in the hood. 

Til all this black on black crime stop. 

Some say the blind lead the blind. 

But in the ghetto you never know  

When it's gon be yo time. 

[Sons of Funk  Mo B. Dick  O'dell] 

Sittin at the ghetto thinkin bout 

All my homies passed away (uuunnnggghhh!) 

Candy painted cadillacs and triple gold 

That's how me and my boys rolled 

How could it be? 

Somebody took my boy from me 

My best friend's gone 

And I'm so all alone 

I really miss my homies 

Even though they gone away 

I know you in a better place 

And I hope to see ya soon someday 

[Master P] 

I used to hang with my boy even slang with my boy 

Used to bang with my boy, goddam I miss my boy 

We started out youngstas in the park throwin birds 

In your hearse, damn it's sad to see my nigga in the dirt 

The game got me workin, got me perkin, never jerkin 

Still blowin dolja fo ya cause I know you up there workin 

Ya little baby's cool and ya baby's mama straight 

But today's a sad day to see the t-shirt with ya face 

From the cradle to the grave, from the streets we used to fall 

In the park you liked to ball, put yo name upon the wall 

In the projects you's a legend on the street you was a star 

But it's sad to see my homeboy ridin in that black car 

A lotta soldiers done died, a lotta mothers done cried 

You done took yo piece of the pie but you was too young to retire 

Why soldiers ride for yo name leave it vain 

Some Gs never change, damn they killed you for some change 

Smile for my homie Kevin Miller my boy Randall 

The ghetto persons that lost they loved ones to these ghetto scandals 

Take a minute to smile for the dead (uuunnnggghhh!) 

Smile for the dead (RIP 2Pac, Makaveli) 

All my homies who done made it to the crossroads 

(Biggie Smalls) 

[Sons, Mo B. O'dell] 

How could it be? 

Somebody took my boy from me 

(It's like I can't believe you gone) 

My best friend's gone 

(Sometimes I feel like I can't go on) 

And I'm so all alone 

(Everytime I see something you done left 

I really miss my homies 

(It just remind me, more and more of you, dawg) 

Even though they gone away 

(I just keep reminiscin) 

I know you in a better place 

(Cause I know you alright) 

And I hope to see ya soon someday 

(And I keep smilin, knowin I'm a see you in the crossroads] 

[Pimp C] 

We used to grip on the grain and flip them candy toys 

But I'd give up all that bullshit if I could get back my boy 

Off in the club smokin weed til 3, hollerin at the hoes 

Spendin $4000 on me on gators and clothes 

When I turned to rap, he had to chase the game 

Nigga told me, ""see, leave that dope, cause rappin is yo thang"" 

I ain't gone even lie, some nights I ride and cry 

Wonderin why the real niggas always the ones to die 

So I just smoke my weed and try to clear my mind 

I wish that I had the power to turn back the hands of time 

I wonder if there's a heaven up there for real Gs 

For all the niggas in the game that be sellin ki's 

I keep my memories, try to keep my head strong 

But baby it's hard to be strong, when yo main homie gone 

[Sons, Mo B. O'dell] 

Even though you gone away 

(Even though you gone, you ain't never gon be forgotten) 

I know you in a better place 

(Cause as long as I'm here 

You gon live through me and other TRU playas) 

I really miss my homies 

Even though they gone away 

I know you in a better place 

And I hope to see ya soon someday 

[Silkk] 

I'm just sittin here dazed thinkin bout all the times we had 

Thinkin the past, some was good and some was bad 

Remember Dante? 

It was a group of us, just a group of five 

Now three dead, one in jail, it seem right now I'm the only one alive 

To all my soldiers before me, may ya'll rest in peace 

When He took three, took my soul, just the bodies 

He at the crossroads guide us out to the rest of me 

Wishin I could rewind time like demos 

Me and you gettin girls, writin down numbers like memos 

Makin million dollar bets, makin all our money stretch like limos 

Even though I smile, it's sad, but they say gangstas can't cry 

But if I close my eyes and visualize me together 

Then I suddenly want to smile 

To see you laid down when it's yo time, when your time was up 

You never seen your child, but he's here to remind us 

Even though you was wrong, I never could belive that that was true 

You was with me forever, you could check my rest in peace tattoos 

See me and see and P forever gon be ridin and thuggin 

Rest in peace to all the ones that didn't make it 

And rest in peace to my brother 

We gon miss you 

(I love these fools) 

I know you in a better place 

(Every time I get on my knees) 

And I hope to see ya soon someday 

(I pray for you, I'm glad you in a better place 

I hope I see ya soon, ain't no more killin 

Ain't no more fights, and ain't no more tears)",I Miss My Homies,2008

Memória de elefante 
Eu sou assim, 
Eu sou folgado, 
Eu dou um olho, 
Eu pulo hidrante

Vai ser o que vier

Quem for sangue bom demorou de se envolver 
Saúde tem demais tem pra dar e vender 
O rap me diverte, faz eu viajar o mundo

Com o tempo, eu fico onde estou, quem vacilou, o esqueleto 
arrastou 
Os homens de preto acionam o dedo, 
Click pleu 
Brooklin,Canão onde eu nasci tá cruel 
Pra frente aqui vou eu e quem não se envolveu 
O meu é partidário vacilou quem prometeu 
O ambiente na quebrada é quente meu 
Entardeceu vacilou na festa é problema seu 
O crime não é crime eu faço parte mas eu sei 
É de lei se respeito é que eu também sei temos que nos 
preservar 
Manter a fé em Deus não pare.

Will you be my girl

Tell me who's gonna make my day seem brighter
When you're gone, when you're gone

Won't you love me for life
Oh, I wish that you'll be my lady, my lady
I love you, girl
It feels so right
And won't you tell me right now
Will you be my girl

DJ Company,"Let's dance in style, let's dance for a while
Heaven can wait we're only watching the skies
Hoping for the best but expecting the worst
Are you gonna drop the bomb or not?
Let us die young or let us live forever
We don't have the power but we never say never
Sitting in a sandpit life is a short trip
The music's for the sad man
Can you imagine when the race is won
Turn out all the faces into the sun
Praising our leaders we're getting in tune
The music's played by the.. the mad man

[Chorus]
Forever young, I wanna be forever young
Do you really wanna live forever
Forever and ever
Forever young, I wanna be forever young
Do you really want to live forever
Forever young

Some are like water some are like heat
Some are a Melodie and some are a beat
Sooner or later we all will be gone
Why don't we stay young?
It's so hard to get on to another course
I don't wanna perish like a fleeing horse
Youth is like diamonds in the sun
And diamonds are forever
So many adventures couldn't happen today
So many songs we forgot to play
So many dreams swingin' out of the blue
Oh let them come true

[Chorus]",Forever Young,1997

You don't even trip when friends say you ain't bringing Drake along

They bring dinner to my room and ask me to initial

And who told you to put them jeans on?

Feeling for a fix then you should really get yo fiend on

Let's dance for a while
Heaven can wait we're only watching the skies
Hoping for the best but expecting the worst
Are you gonna drop the bomb or not?
Let us die young or let us live forever
We don't have the power but we never say never
Sitting in a sandpit
Life is a short trip
The music's for the sad man

Forever young
I wanna be forever young
Do you really want to live forever?
Forever and ever
Forever young I wanna be
Forever young
Do you really want to live forever?
Forever, forever young

So we live a life like a video
When the sun is always out and you never get old
And the champagne's always cold
And the music is always good
And the pretty girls just happened to stop by in the hood
And they hop their pretty ass up on the hood of that pretty ass car
Without a wrinkle in today
'Cause there is no tomorrow
Just some picture perfect day
To last a whole lifetime
And it never ends
'Cause all we have to do is hit rewind
So lets just stay in the moment, smoke some weed
Drink some wine,
Reminisce talk some shit forever young is in your mind
Leave a mark that can't erase neither space nor time
So when the director yells cut
I'll be fine
I'm forever young

Fear not much while were alive
Life is for living not living up tight
See ya somewhere up in the sky
Fear not die, I'll be alive for a million years, bye bye
So not for legends, I'm forever young
My name shall survive
Through the darkest blocks, over kitchen stoves
Over Pyrex pots, my name shall be passed down to generations
While debating up in barber shops, young slung, hung here
Shorty, the nigga from here
With a little ambition just what we can become here
And as the father passed his story down to his sons ears

Excuse my charisma, vodka with a spritzer
Swagger down pat, call my shit Patricia
Young Money militia, and I am the commissioner
You don't want start Weezy, 'cause the F is for Finisher
So misunderstood, but what's a World without enigma?
Two bitches at the same time, synchronized swimmers
Got the girl twisted 'cause she open when you twist her
Never met the bitch, but I f-ck her like I missed her
Life is the bitch, and death is her sister
Sleep is the cousin, what a fuckin' family picture
You know father time, we all know mother nature
It's all in the family, but I am of no relation
No matter who's buying, I'm a celebration
Black and white diamonds, f-ck segregation
F-ck that shit, my money up, you n-ggas just Honey Nut
Young Money running shit and you n-ggas just runner-ups
I don't feel I done enough, so I'ma keep on doing this shit

I'm goin' back in
Okay, I lost my mind, it's somewhere out there stranded
I think you stand under me if you don't understand me
Had my heart broken by this woman named Tammy
But hoes gon' be hoes, so I couldn't blame Tammy
Just talked to moms, told her she the sweetest
I beat the beat up, call it self defense
Swear man, I be seeing through these n-ggas like sequins
N-ggas think they He-Men, pow, pow, the end
Talking to myself because I am my own consultant
Married to the money, f-ck the world, that's adultery
You full of sh-t, you close your mouth and let yo ass talk
Young Money eating, all you haters do is add salt
Stop playing, bitch, I got this game on deadbolt
Mind so sharp, I f-ck around and cut my head off
Real n-gga all day and tomorrow
But these muthaf-ckas talking crazy like they jaw broke
Glass half empty, half full, I'll spill ya

Try me and run into a wall, outfielder
You know I'ma ball 'til they turn off the field lights
The fruits of my labor, I enjoy 'em while they still ripe
Bitch, stop playing, I do it like a king do
If these n-ggas animals, then I'ma have a mink soon
Tell 'em bitches I say put my name on the wall
I speak the truth, but I guess that's a foreign language to y'all
And I call it like I see it, and my glasses on
But most of y'all don't get the picture 'less the flash is on
Satisfied with nothing, you don't know the half of it
Young Money, Cash Money
Paper chasing, tell that paper, Look, I'm right behind ya
Bitch, real G's move in silence like lasagna
People say I'm borderline crazy, sorta kinda
Woman of my dreams, I don't sleep so I can't find her
You n-ggas are gelatin, peanuts to an elephant
I got through that sentence like a subject and a predicate
Yeah, with a swag you would kill for
Money too strong, pockets on bodybuilder
Jumped in a wishing well, now wish me well
Tell 'em kiss my ass, call it kiss and tell

Word to my mama, I'm out of my lima bean
Don't wanna see what that drama mean, get some Dramamine
Llama scream, hotter than summer sun on a Ghana queen
Now all I want is hits, bitch, Wayne signed a fiend
I played the side for you n-ggas that's tryna front, and see
Son of Gunz, Son of Sam, you n-ggas the son of me
Pause for this dumber speech, I glow like Buddha
Disturb me, and you'll be all over the flow like Luda
Bitch, I flow like scuba, bitch, I'm bald like Cuba
And I keep a killer ho, she gon' blow right through ya
I be mackin', 'bout my stacking, now I pack like a mover
Shout to ratchet for backing out on behalf of my shooter
N-ggas think they high as I, I come laugh at your ruler
Cash Money cold, bitch, but our actions is cooler
Wayne, these n-ggas out they mind
I done told these f-ck n-ggas, so many times
That I keep these bucks steady on my mind
Tuck these, I f-ck these on your mind, pause
To feed them, on my grind, did I get a little love?
Keep throwin' my sign in the middle
Hit 'em up, piece on my side, 'cause ain't no peace on my side, bitch
I'm a man, I visit urinals abroad

I'm uptown, thoroughbred, a BX n-gga, ya heard?

DJ Cover This,"I turn the music up, I got my records on
I shut the world outside until the lights come on
Maybe the streets alight, maybe the trees are gone
I feel my heart start beating to my favorite song

And all the kids they dance, all the kids all night
Until Monday morning feels another life
I turn the music up
I'm on a roll this time
And heaven is in sight

I turn the music up, I got my records on
From underneath the rubble sing a rebel song
Don't want to see another generation drop
I'd rather be a comma than a full stop

Maybe I'm in the black, maybe I'm on my knees
Maybe I'm in the gap between the two trapezes
But my heart is beating and my pulses start
Cathedrals in my heart

As we saw oh this light I swear you, emerge blinking into
To tell me it's alright
As we soar walls, every siren is a symphony
And every tear's a waterfall

Oh oh oh

And I'd do anything just to see her face
But she's far far away
Walk a thousand miles just to see her smile again

Again, sitting on the plane
Reminiscing back when I made that mistake
I wish it never ended, with a heartbreak
Now your heartbroken, tears in your face
I ask myself why, lookin' at the sky
If I could turn back I'd make it all right
Praying that your better but it's still stormy weather
Don't wanna let go but the rain won't let up
Now you're gone 

Still thinkin' 'bout you everyday, and I
Know feelings was hurt and you're complaining but
I'm sorry for the games that I played
But now it's too late and now

[Chorus]

It's cold putting up a fight
Arguing back, and forth through the night
Regardless what I said, I don't mean most of it
You know I really love you that's the real it's gon' get
It takes time, to realize what you really wanna know
You was ready for it all but your feelings I ignored
I know my fault I should've gave more
Now your miles away and I'm out on tour
Now it's drums playing, crowd singing, lights changing
Wish you was here to witness all that a stars spaying
They say two wrongs don't make it right
And I was wrong now it ain't right

[Chorus]

If I could turn back, if I could make it right, I'd do just that
If I could make it right, I'd do it all tonight, put you in my arms, with you I'd spend my life

I'd do just that for you to come back here again

I'm about to lose my mind
You’ve been gone for so long, I’m runnin' outta time
I need a doctor, call me a doctor
I need a doctor, doctor to bring me back to life

[Verse 1: Eminem]
I told the world one day I would pay it back
Say it on tape, and lay it, record it so that one day I could play it back
But I don’t even know if I believe it when I’m sayin' that
Doubts startin' to creep in, every day it's just so grey and black
Hope, I just need a ray of that, cause no one sees my vision
When I play it for ‘em, they just say it's wack, but they don’t know what dope is
And I don’t know if I was awake or asleep when I wrote this
All I know is you came to me when I was at my lowest
You picked me up, breathed new life in me, I owe my life to you
But for the life of me, I don't see why you don't see like I do
But it just dawned on me you lost a son, demons fighting you, it’s dark
Let me turn on the lights and brighten me and enlighten you
I don't think you realise what you mean to me, not the slightest clue
Cause me and you were like a crew, I was like your sidekick
You gon either wanna fight me when I get off this f***in' mic
Or you gon' hug me, but I'm outta options, there's nothin' else I can do cause

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Eminem]
It hurts when I see you struggle, you come to me with ideas
You say they're just pieces, so I’m puzzled, cause the s*** I hear is crazy
But you're either gettin' lazy or you don’t believe in you no more
Seems like your own opinions, not one you can form
Can't make a decision you keep questionin' yourself
Second guessin' and it's almost like your beggin' for my help
Like I’m your leader, you're supposed to f***in' be my mentor
I can endure no more I demand you remember who you are
It was YOU, who believed in me when everyone was tellin'
You don't sign me, everyone at the f***in' label, let's tell the truth
You risked your career for me, I know it as well as you
Nobody wanted to f*** with the white boy, Dre, I’m cryin' in this booth
You saved my life, now maybe it's my turn to save yours
But I can never repay you, what you did for me is way more
But I ain't givin' up faith and you ain't givin' up on me
Get up Dre I'm dyin', I need you, come back for f***’s sake

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Dr. Dre]
It literally feels like a lifetime ago
But I still remember the s*** like it was just yesterday, though
You walked in, yellow jump suit, whole room, cracked jokes
Once you got inside the booth, told you, mic smoke
Went through friends, some of them I put on, but they just left
They said they was ridin' to the death, but where the f*** are they now?
Now that I need them, I don't see none of them
All I see is Slim, f*** all you fair-weather friends, all I need is him
F***in' backstabbers, when the chips were down you just laughed at us
Now you bout to feel the f***in' wrath of Aftermath, faggots
You gon' see us in our lab jackets and ask us where the f*** we been?
You can kiss my indecisive a** crack, maggots
And the crackers' a**, little cracker jack beat
Makin' wack math, backwards producers, I'm back bastards
One more CD and then I’m packin' up my bags and as I’m leavin'
I’ll guarantee they scream, ""Dre, don’t leave us like that man!"" cause",I Need a Doctor,2011

All of my change I spent on you
Where have the times gone, baby it's all wrong
Where are the plans we made for two

Yeah, I, I know it's hard to remember
The people we used to be
It's even harder to picture
That you're not here next to me

You say it's too late to make it
But is it too late to try
And in our time that you wasted
All of our bridges burned down

I've wasted my nights
You turned out the lights
Now I'm paralyzed
Still stuck in that time
When we called it love
But even the sun sets in paradise

All of my change I spent on you
Where have the times gone, baby it's all wrong

I would still be holding you like this
All those fairy tales are full of shit
One more fucking love song, I'll be sick

'Cause you forgot yesterday
I gave you my love to borrow
But you just gave it away

I'll be out spending all this money
While you're sitting round wondering
Why it wasn't you who came up from nothing
Made it from the bottom
Now when you see me I'm stunting
And all of my cars start with a push of a button

Telling me the chances I blew up
Or whatever you call it
Switch the number to my phone
So you never could call it
Don't need my name on my show
You can tell it I'm ballin'

Swish, what a shame could have got picked
Had a really good game but you missed your last shot
So you talk about who you see at the top
Or what you could have saw but sad to say it's over for

Wiz like go away, got what you was looking for

In his right hand was your man's worst nightmare
Loud enough to burst his right eardrum close-range
The game is not only dangerous, but it's most strange

I sell rhymes like dimes
The one who mostly keep cash but brag about the broker times
Joking rhymes, like the ""Is you just happy to see me?"" trick
Classical slapstick rappers need Chapstick
A lot of 'em sound like they in a talent show
So I give 'em something to remember like the Alamo
Tally-ho! A high Joker like a Spades game
Came back from five years laying and stayed the same
I'm saying - electromagnetic field it blocks all logic, Spock
And G-Shocks her biological clock
When I hit it, slit it to the shitter, thought I killed her goose
Her Power U was pure Brita water, filtered juice
Keep a pen like a fiend keep a pipe with him
Gentleman who lent a pen to a friend who write with him
Never seen the shit again but he's still my dunny
The only thing that come between us is krill and money
I sell rhymes like dimes
The one who mostly keep cash but brag about the broke times

Better rhymes make for better songs, it matters not
If you got a lot of what it takes just to get along
Surrender now or suffer serious setbacks
Got get-back, connects wet-back, get stacks
Even if you gots to get jet-black, head to toe
To get the dough, battle for bottles of Mo' or 'dro
This fly flow take practice like Tae Bo with Billy Blanks
""Oh, you're too kind!"" ""Really? Thanks!""
To the gone and lost forever like ""Oh My Darling Clementine""
He hold his heart when he telling rhyme
When it's his time, I hope his soul go to Heaven
He nasty like the old time Old No. 7
You still taste it when you chase it with the Coca-Cola
Make 'em wish they could erase it out the Motorola
I told her - no credit for a bag
If you want what they got, then go get it, it's all gak
Only in America could you find a way to earn a healthy buck
And still keep your attitude on self-destruct

Outside with no shirt (I remember n****)
Talked loud in that church (I remember n****)
N**** stole all my work (I remember n****)
Kirby took my lick in court (I remember n****)

Them plantation days, do you remember that
The good times that we had in big dig em lac
Do you remember Debra Proch when it was hot and steaming
Do you remember when we moved shop down there by Lehman
Do you remember at the room hoes caughting semen
Do you remember I busted two with the green eye demon
Yeah n**** I remember cross the tracks
When Capt. Ricks and Kenny Wayne had a gang of that crack
Man I remember all that when E-Forty was jamming
Everybody play B's and D's listening to that Dayton family
I remember daddy-O when he put me on syrup
Remember Junior was fourteen working with a quarter bird n****

Killing my own people
Serving my own uncles
Gave life to tell (I remember n****)

My first fifty block of weed (I remember n****)
I wouldn't nothing but nineteen(I remember n****)
When I first meet tee and Mel (I remember n****)

They still racist, I can see it on them bitches’ faces
That’s why I’m smokin’ and laughin’ I got my grind on
And they don’t feel my struggle they think my mind gone
That’s why it’s murder, murder kill, kill on the corner
These little niggas got big pistols ready to put it on your
So, when you die you might as well be high
Is it heaven or hell or is it all a lie?
That’s why I smoke purple on Monday, purple on Tuesday
Two glocks cocked so they don’t bruise me

Ain't no crack up in the windows I can barely even breathe
Got me fumblin’ and trippin’ almost passed the blunt to Cee
Got it cloudy in the Bentley niggas squinting tryin’ to see
And they don’t know what time it is but I know it’s time to eat
Ridin’ dirty bumping, ridin’ dirty know how that shit be
One day your hear and the next day you going on repeat
With that nine up in my reach right now dyin’ ain’t for me
Mayne this pine got me sleepy but I’m too high to go to sleep
Bust a hooty when you rollin’ potent as you s’posed to be
You be rollin’ and smokin’ ‘em back to back consistently
Keep movin’ dutches to Phillies, garcias, and shisha sweets
Young savage don't really care just put that shit in the air

Smokin’ on purple ease my mind
This that shit that we get high to, yeah
It's murder, murder, murder gotta keep you nine
This that shit that we ride to, yeah

This is the way I live
Lil' Boy still pushin' big wheels
I stack my money, lay low, and chill
Don't need to work hard that's the way I feel, I feel, I

Lil' Boy still pushin' big wheels
I stack my money, lay low, and chill
Don't need to work hard that's the way I feel, I feel, I
This is the way I live

Six months later now we're big dog status
Name elevated but I still act average
Rockin' shows in Dallas, ball like I play for the Mavericks
West Bank rapper and I'm one of the baddest
French Rivera spa and I'm getting in shape man
I think I'm Super M-a-n without a cape man
Grindin' all day hustlin', all for the cake man
I'm a Benjamin stack one inch taller than Great Danes
Thrifty made cheap Ray-Bans like a felon
I'm growin' up now spittin' hotter than Mohellans
And I'm still livin' good never gonna flop
I'm a young little dude, stay runnin' from cops
Emerald Row is the place where I got my props
People love me in the hood they don't want me to stop
So uhh, that's the only way I know how to rock
And I'm a stay rappers like won't stop 'til I drop

I I's Baby Boy and I done it again
I'm ridin' fly with D-Wizzle in the 'cedes Benz
Twenty two on the ride with the ladies in
Red Bull, Grey Goose, now the ladies bent
Now we go and do our thing under a shady tent
And they don't question what I say 'cause I'm a ladies pimp
See this little one right here this fellow got stripes
And I's gon' repesent, Marrero for life
Money in my pocket but I still act trife
While I in the club they say lil' parlor ain't right
Look I'm doing great that's the way I feel
Hustlin' hard all day that's the way I live

[Chorus]

Thug Life how I live everyday
New Benz new charger new Chevrolet
It's the I way live, real gutta man
Always known for doin' gutta thangs all da girls love me man
Fresh Shades big lot, ooh bad chick
Me and shawty Gucci'd down at the classic, Boosie he da baddest
I Got a down ghetto chick but I be damned if a nigga get married
I mingle with da finest, bling ya with my diamonds you can't see I'm shinin'
I got da best music, 'cause I keep it real
So I hit them Big booty gals when I'm in my crib
In out of jail I run the streets for real
Dis how I live kill me and you gon' get killed
In red monkeys I'm a donkey I love stuntin'
Love money love my city, boys call me country country

So they figure if they sign me one year later I'll have a toe tag, look
They holla banner, they holla Ma$e, and they holla Trick

Y'all niggas listening to these rappers, they liein'
Don't think cause this nigga swole bruh, that this nigga soilder

And Duck Down he started all that nasty bitch
Tupac, told you bout the fucking guns, jigga,
Told ya how to put the work in the can and, run

DJ Dado,"This is how it goes
Give me your attention, stop what you're doin' and listen up
Because my partner in rhyme is about to tear it up
Jeff, is if someone said that your beats don't excite
And that your cuts were whack, what would you say? 
Yeah, right
Jeff's about to give an incredible display
And unequivocally prove that he's the best deejay
His name is Jazzy Jeff and he's preparing to shake and make you move
To this long and strong theme song, Jazzy's groove
And it'll make 'em clap to this
Make 'em clap to this
Hey yo, Jeff
Come on, yeah
And it'll make 'em clap to this
And it'll make 'em clap to this
Come on, yeah
You know, a lot of deejays, they're just short pieces of statues
My deejay's swift and exciting and coming at you
To other deejays Jeff is just too much
He doesn't use the line switch as a transform crutch
Never missin beats, always on time with the rhyme
You know the scratches are fine when intertwined with a bass line
Live in concert, Jeff is never Memorex
You don't believe he's def? 
Check the flex
Jeff cuts up
Don't stop to the rhythm, 'cause I
I could talk forever, but still never explain
Why deejays flee when they hear Jeff's name
Jeff is number one, even though he just begun
Ruling hip-hop as if he was Attila the hun
We make records, it all adds up a kaleidoscope
We work hard, so people can't deny that it's dope
Some music makes you shake, some makes you move
Now here's what I want y'all to do
This beat is dope and it's called Jazzy's groove
Come on, yeah
Na-na-na-na
Come on, yeah
Now here's what I want y'all to do
Na-na-na-na
Break
The uncannible
Break
Break
Break
Breakdown
Music has a tendency, a way of makin you feel it
It's been a secret and Jeff is about to reveal it
He'll get you hype, no kiddin, as def as Jeff is
He makes you smile and bow while he's flexin
He's a magician of sorts, it's kind of a sport
Jeff houses the wheels like Michael Jordan the courts
Ask who's the best and people'll say that Jeffrey is
Here's a math lesson, so you can all see how def he is
(one) plus (one) is (two)
(Once again back is the incredible)
And (two) plus (one) is (three)
(The music just turns me on)
And (two) plus (two) is (four)
(Play it on the radio)
And (one) plus (two) is (three)
Four
Look, it's simple, just admit it
Jeff is the deafest, you wanted a battle, forget it
You're a fool, you're slippin, you're looney, you're crazy
No ifs, no ands if he tests your butt, baby
The music is dope, don't fight it, just give in
Hey yo Jeff, man, tell em why you did it
(I made the beat hype, but still kinda smooth)
And it's dope, right? (For sure) Jazzy's groove
It goes 'ooh' ooh
Na-na-na-na' na-na-na-na
It goes 'ooh' ooh

But now you take my breath away 
Suddenly you're in my life 
Part of ev'ry thing I do 
You got me working day and night 
Just tryin' to keep a hold on you 

Here in your arms I found my paradise 
My only chance for happiness 
And if I lose you now, I think I would die

Of people so in love like you and me 
And I can see myself, let history repeat itself

Thinkin' 'bout those people then 
I know that in a thousand years 
I'd fall in love with you again 

This is the only way that we should fly

I know it hurt you in the worst way
I know that I would trade it all if you stay
I know I'm not perfect
I know that everybody ain't
But if it's one thing I know that I know, I know nothing at all
You don't pick up when I call
I'll make it up by tomorrow

And if I told you that I love you would you know it was a lie
Pretty woman, how you function with the devil in your thighs?
I see heaven in your eyes, I love to see you cry
The drugs inside your mind got you thinking different
Why you hiding from me? Fuck your inhibitions
Why you crazy lover? Think that you should be my baby mother
Let me slow it down, think I'm kinda tripping

Nothing come between us, I need for you to lemme know
Everybody looking for that special soul, is it you?
If you think it's true, need you to lemme know

Baby lemme know, if you feelin' right, you can spend the night
We can go, anywhere you like, nothing got a price
I suppose, that you wasn't quite the type who be doing it
Fo' sho, we can keep it on the low and take a load off
Soon as you walk up in the room, take ya clothes off
Bed to the floor, baby you know how it go
Nothing less and nothing more than what we make it
Consummating for a long time 'til the condom breakin'
Conversations in my head about some head, you got some commentary for a nigga?
I ain't tryna be too forward with ya, lookin' forward to ya
Tryna split a couple kids, maybe mortgage with ya
Do it all to get ya
So just lemme know

Pop it baby, don't keep me waitin'

Munching on the leaves
Pitter patter
Makes me forget my disease

Of the joy that means that much
It lives within her touch

Even if we just pretend
Why won't you be my friend

Walking the lost way of those who lived in loneliness 

Think of the joy and the endless days
One step aside and the skies were gre
why Is this a life or just a game to lose or win? 

Cause a day will turn into night
And the spirits will rise
There will come then a time to understand...
Deep inside 

Blessed by the rain falling from above
Could you imagine where life would take you 
Now that you're praying for everyone you hurt so bad? 

Still, don't you go, got to make a choice
Crying in silence, crying with no voice
Dare you to stay now and keep your strength up till the end?... 

Cause a day will turn into night
And the spirits will rise
Hold your breath, keep your eyes wide open 

Now you see: the night is so clear
And you feel: the spirits are here
Running free, running free without fear
You'll find a way to the brightest light... 

And now
Here I am, open arms
Thought your life was over when
There you saw in the sky
A ray of light,
So here I am 

Will the stars keep shining bright
Till one day they may ignite?
When you gaze at the sky above,
I'll ever come down
To ease your solitude... 

And now
Here I am, open arms
Thought your life was over when
There you saw in the sky
A ray of light,
So here I am 

There you saw in the sky

Always by your side
There will come a time to understand!!",Here I Am,1997

You go call your crew
We can rendezvous at the bar around two
Plans to leave, throw the keys to 'Lil Cease
Pull the truck up, front, and roll up the next blunt
So we can steam on the way to the telly go fill my belly
A t-bone steak, cheese eggs and Welch's grape
Conversate for a few, 'cause in a few, we gon' do
What we came to do, ain't that right boo (true)

Beat you so bad make you feel like you ain't wanna be born
And tell your friends stay the hell out of my lawn.
Chicken George became Dead George stealin' chickens from my farm.
Damn, Another dead pigeon
If your mafiosos then I'm bringin' on Haitian Sicilians
Nobody's shootin', my body's made of hand grenade

I take a look at my life and realize there's none left
'Cause I've been brassing and laughing so long that
Even my mamma thinks that my mind is gone
But I ain't never crossed a man that didn't deserve it
Me be treated like a punk, you know that's unheard of
You better watch how you talking, and where you walking
Or you and your homies might be lined in chalk
I really hate to trip but I gotta lope
As they croak I see myself in the pistal smoke fool
I'm the kinda G that little homies want to be like
On my knees in the night, saying prayers in the street light

They been spending most their lives living in the gangsta's paradise
They been spending most their lives living in the gangsta's paradise
We keep spending most our lives living in the gangsta's paradise
We keep spending most our lives living in the gangsta's paradise

They got the situation, they got me facing
I can't live a normal life, I was raised by the strip
So I gotta be down with the hood team
Too much television watching got me chasing dreams
I'm a educated fool with money on my mind
Got my ten in my hand and a gleam in my eye
I'm a loped out gangsta set trippin banger
And my homies is down so gonna rouse my anger fool
Death aint nothing but a heart beat away
I'm living life do or die, what can I say
I'm twenty three never will I live to see 24
The way things is going I don't know

Tell me why are we so blind to see
That the ones we hurt are you and me.

Minute after minute, hour after hour
Everybody's running, but half of them ain't looking
What's going on in the kitchen, but I don't know what's cooking
They say I've got to learn but nobody's here to teach me
If they can't understand it, how can they reach me
I guess they can't
I guess they won't
I guess they front
That's why I know my life is out of luck fool

[Chorus]
Now I cold rock a party in a b-girl stance
I rock on the floor make the fellas wanna dance
I be the shit and it's all good and if you understood

Would you stop scheming and trying to look hard
I'll get my bodyguard, You'll get that booty scarred,
I'm a veteran which means that I've been
In the game too long Since the days of Paper Thin
Way back when I've been putting it down
Ask your homies who's the baddest bitch on this side of town
I float like a butterfly sting like a bee,
Spectacular on the M I C,
I go for broke, Never giving it less than the best
Many years in the game at your request,
You like the rhyme bite if you dare,
I get the paper so I don't care,
Fly that's me the epitome
Of what a real MC is supposed to be,
Fucking you up every time that I drop,
Fuck a bullet baby, I done took your spot
I guide the best and I ride it well
And if you take a look it ain't hard to tell that I

Cold rock a party in a b-girl stance
I rock on the floor make the fellas wanna dance
I be the shit and it's all good and if you understood

Would you back off me and let my skin breathe,
Lyte is everlasting it's hard to believe
I shall prevail cause I'm next to none
Cause I'm claiming no set, don't plan to get down.
Just Brooklyn is where I'm from
But I'm resting in Studio City for the fun,
If you don't understand just say you don't(nah!)
And don't wait for me to explain cause I won't
You see it's in my nature to be the best,
West to East See East to West,
Ready or not I have arrived and I'm live
Showing an MC how to survive.
It's crazy how I get you captured with my tactics,
I got many witnesses who can back this
Ruffnecks from New York to LA
Been down with me since Poor Georgie.
It's '96, it's all about show and prove
And I'm about to make the ill type moves,
I guide the beat and ride it well
And if you take a look it ain't hard to tell that I

Cold rock a party in a b-girl stance
I rock on the floor make the fellas wanna dance
I be the shit and it's all good and if you understood

Would you get out my shit, please let me be,
I don't see why, you KGB
Why you gotta be all up on me like that,
Trying to get over like a fat rat,
But I understand, I'm a woman in the land of hip-hop
And the shit don't stop,
It goes on, on, on, on
You see the shit don't stop till the break of dawn
And now who makes it liver than a hip-hop, scuba diver,
Chillin with a pina colada,
Kidada hooked me up with Tommy now I got a lot of gear
From everywhere that I'd like to share (yeah right!)
But I'd rather do Kani, Don't ask why! 5001, my son gets shit
Done
All on the catwalk, what they've ever done for you
You betta get down with your real crew,

Cold...
Our road was paved to the edge of time...
Steel... Sparks...
Come with me now to the edge of time...
Does anyone remember who I am?

In a few moments you will have an experience which will seem completely real...
It will be the result of your subconscious fears, transformed to your conscious awareness...
You have 5 seconds to terminate this tape...
5, 4, 3, 2, 1.

Has everybody got a place to hide?
...is everybody inside?
Has everybody got a place to hide?
...is everybody inside?

There's a game out there, and the stakes are high.
And the guy who runs it figures the averages all day long, and all night...
Once in a while he let's you steal a pot,
But if you stay in the game long enough, you've got to lose,
And once you've lost, there's no way back...
No way at all...

Junk in your words don't show in your face I wait for your face to break
Vicious and clean edge like a razor hunting the lazerblade
Its free to the sweet one the short and the brief one silence is dangerous
Show me illusion in all the confusion peculiar database

Open up what am I ?

Easily voice on the line soothe it to sooth you

Nigga talking like a G but walking like a broad
I pull up at the light, pineapple in your car
Nigga I shatter lives, my music camouflage
I court killers at the center of my synagogue
Torch in hand, extortion to the fortune five hundred
From the porches to the Porsche's with the wides on it
'Fore you snitches bitch, you better put your lives on it
Get you twisted by the ? with them wires on it
I get my money smoking spliffs like it's Friday

Today motherfucker, won't budge for no charge
Real nigga, I hold no grudge with no thugs
Come through spraying, bullets out the McLaren
They ain't meant for you, so move bitch, you hard of hearing?
I speed off doing 90 with the Carter blaring
Bust shots in the Cavalier like I ball with Baron
Yeah I Blake Griff niggas, make stiff niggas
Eminem wasn't Dr. Dre's only sick nigga

Insane in the membrane like Soul Assassins
Twelve gauge stop a nigga heart like a bowl of Aspirin
I hold automatics, let your man hold the casket
Murder game cold as Aspen, body found in the trash bin
First forty-eight, they don't find me, case closed
Like a rehabilitation spot in Bobby Brown nose
Take em back to Boyz in da Hood when I pull the pump out
Something like C-Murder on Worldstar when I dump out

Ain't nothing changed but them bullets in my clip
I still pull it, still bully niggas on the strip
Beef, I cook it fully with the fifth
And I ain't got no pets, I put a bullet in ya bitch
A nigga with a gun in his hand who won't bust it?
Like a bitch with a dick in her hand who won't suck it
This is the art of war, you niggas just drawing
Anything I target on is dearly departed, gone
Drive by or walk up on, I just stop, breathe, aim cock squeeze
Silencer on the Glock, infrared beam
So your block up on machines while the pussies run and scream

Remember Meek dead broke? Look at me, up now
I run my city from south Philly back to uptown
Thank god, all these bottles I popped
All this paper I been gettin, all these models I popped
I done sold a hundred thousand before my album got dropped
And I'm only 23 I'm the shit now look at me
Look at me I'm a boss like my nigga Rozay
Shawty asked me for a check, I told that bitch like no way
'Cause I made it from the bottom there was nothin' on the way
And I never had a job, you know I had to sell yay

Snatch his soul up out that shirt let's take him for that ride

Bitch I'm a boss, you a fraud, you cross the line I get you murdered for a cost
Out in Vegas, I took a loss
At the fight we watchin' Floyd we on the floor
Scared money don't make no money

And life was nothing but an awful song
But now I know the meaning of true love
I'm leaning on the everlasting arms

If I can see it, then I can do it
If I just believe it, there's nothing to it

I believe I can fly
I believe I can touch the sky
I think about it every night and day
Spread my wings and fly away
I believe I can soar
I see me running through that open door
I believe I can fly
I believe I can fly
I believe I can fly

See I was on the verge of breaking down
Sometimes silence can seem so loud
There are miracles in life I must achieve
But first I know it starts inside of me, oh

If I can see it, then I can be it
If I just believe it, there's nothing to it

With them luggers from they rugers on they deserts

Watch my n****s bring the riot

Came from the heavens just to sing a song for you
To the rhythm of my love for you,
And now it's beating slow, and you know
This the end of the road when I sing this slow song for you you
And love was nothin' but another gun for you
And I would hide it in my hopeless soul
I'm not afraid to go down the road where we go,
I don't know, you can hear them callin, don't you,
When the angels call like

If you don't wanna stay you can goo
But since love don't live here no more
The angels are flying so low,
Singing to you (don't you hear me callin you)
He's the one you love (cause I hear them callin me)
And he's the one you trust (now that time is almost through)
Time is runnin out (there's nothin left to do)

When the angels call like (i answer)

Calling, for you, I will tell the angels now
Let them turn back in to stone
I do, love you, it's true

They were warnings after all

It was this bitch that I knew back from '86 
Graduated and made it from the college of dicks 
Now who the fuck you be, bitch you know me 
Tryin' to act solo, down low, hush-hush, and lo-key 
 
Nah hoe I ain't po', where did my motherfuckers go 
I remember this hoe, she used to do nails for Rochelle's, well 
How the hell you been since I had no job 
Hum, why don't you give me some 
 
'Cause you know I flow and run for Suave 
Nah, all of that was on the couch 
No doubt why y'all records spin, why y'all shippin' in gold 
It's cold On The Outside lookin' in (brrrr!) 
 
You'd best a make yourself worthy 
Cause I got a click of niggas ready to get their johnson very dirty 
You heard me push these thirty dicks, inside your pearly clit 
Ain't this a bitch 

I remember when you would not give me shit 
Now you down for them habits 
Put your numbers on them naturals 
Make it snappy cause I got to go to the bathroom

Shakin' that ass in the club nigga what? 
Hoes with no clothes sure enough 
Shakin' that ass in the club nigga what?

Hoes with no clothes sure enough 
Shakin' that ass in the club nigga what?, Suave love

Hair extensions, long nails, ass thicker than gumbo 
Make it fast, takin' cash, shakin' ass in the mix 
 
Tens turn to twenties and twenties come from plenty tricks 
Niggas in love 
Can't stay out the club 
All in the hoe's face 
But at the end of the paper chase, whatever you had will be erased 
 
I see him in the back 
Countin' up that cheddar 
Talkin' loud, smokin' hay, makin' clouds, gettin' ready for the crowd 
I think I know one 
 
I remember you, oh yes I do 
Tryin' to hide side from me and my crew, but ain't no love lost boo 
What time the club close, at 3 
What's up, you comin' with me 

We can smoke up mad trees after you get up off your knees 
You want some cheese 
Hoes don't stay at the suave house 
Hoes around my nuts like knots 
 
Real dogs don't pay for cats, that's 
For real baby 
Recognize and sho me love, dig that shit, sure enough

Wants to get close to me 
A few years back in the past, you wouldn't of even noticed me 
Quoting the, lyrics of the songs that you know I flow 
 
Lookin' for, confidants, and tickets to my next show 
Check yo' bitch 
In these short ass pants and blow up dresses 
I can tell they freaky with out three guesses 
 
Oh yes it's very true 
Your bitches be needin' me, leavin' you 
Hell, now what the fuck is a nigga like me supposed to do 
Let her loose or let her remain 

'Cause all she be lookin' for is some fame 
A bigger name 
Look, this thang with bigger game 
And she claim she ain't heard my music 
 
Tryin' to trick me 
So I told that hoe my name Bill Bigsley 
She still hit me 
Now she, killin' my dick softly with her mouth and I 
 
Really just don't plan on takin' it out cause I

Great booty better thighs I ain't wanna tell her bye
First, I tell her hi, then I give her one and let her fly
Never tell her lie the night you couldn't find a better guy
King shit fly to anywhere you get seen with
Gangsta distinguished, cool as a penguin
Got a team of them, honey feel free to bring with
G-5 waiting, fly away at my convenience
You seen Tip checking in a 5 star suite with some 5 star freaks
Gettin' high all week, catch me in the V
I was in the back when y'all sleep
In a fast car super bad broad back seat
That's me, see I'm nothing nice, fuck a couple nights
See the moon say goodbye and the sun greeting us like

DJ Disciple,"At last, my love has come along
my lonely days are over, and life is like a song
At last,the skies above are blue
My heart was wrapped in clover
Every since the night I looked at you

And I found a dream that I could speak to
A dream to call my own
I found a thrill to press my cheek to
A thrill I'd never known
When you smiled, and then the spell was cast
And here we are in Heaven, I found my love at last

I found a dream that I could speak to,
A dream  to call my own
I found a thrill to press my cheek to
A thrill like I had never known
You smiled, when you smiled at me that was how the spell was cast
And here we are in Heaven
I found my love at last",Love's Here [Disciple's Bumpin Vocal],1997
DJ Disciple,"Time marches on never ending, 
Time keeps its own time,
Here we stand at beginning, 
And then goes passing us by,
And I, I, I can dream for us all, 
I hope I'm in a better state,
When here and now crumbles and falls 
And you, you , you who make worlds collide
I knew you'd come knocking one day,
Unannounced like a thief in the night.

Where do we go from here, 
Time ain't nothing but time, 
I now have no fear of my fears
And no more tears to cry, 
Tomorrow, tomorrow, tomorrow means nothing at all
If we don't hear the line,
When today places its call, and morning, morning, morning
Won't ever be the same, 
Now I won't make the same mistakes, time and time again (5x)

So tell me how do you do
Finally I meet you
You don't know what I've been through,
Waiting and wondering about you
I had a dream my trip would end at you, 
And now I know paradise.

Time marches on never ending, 
Time keeps its own time,
Here we stand at beginning, 
And then goes passing us by,
And I, I, I can dream for us all,

When here and now crumbles and falls 
And you, you , you who make worlds collide
I knew you'd come knocking one day,
Unannounced like a thief in the night.

So tell me how do you do
Finally I meet you
You don't know what I've been through,
Waiting and wondering about you
I had a dream my trip would end at you, 
And now I know paradise.

So tell me how do you do

DJ Disse,"Heaven, I'm in Heaven,  
And my heart beats so that I can hardly speak;
And I seem to find the happiness I seek
When we're out together dancing, cheek to cheek.

Heaven, I'm in Heaven, 
And the cares that hang around me thro' the week
Seem to vanish like a gambler's lucky streak
When we're out together dancing, cheek to cheek.

Oh! I love to climb a mountain, 
And to reach the highest peak,
But it doesn't thrill me half as much
As dancing cheek to cheek.

Oh! I love to go out fishing 
In a river or a creek,
But I don't enjoy it half as much
As dancing cheek to cheek.

Dance with me
I want my arm about you;
The charm about you
Will carry me thro' to Heaven

I'm in Heaven, 
And my heart beats so that I can hardly speak; 
And I seem to find the happiness I seek
When we're out together dancing cheek to cheek.",Cheek to Cheek,2009

Gots to act real bad when I close red doors

Rocks up on my wrists and got haters on my list

Gots to bring havack where them boys at
Fixin to break the mic now is that Fat Pat?

And some niggaz act like they want to pull a gat
But they betta watch out for the boy PAT
That's them motherfuckin haters can they handle me
Cause I be so throwed in this game

Grip wood grain on the shirt I leave a stain 
Cause you try to jack a real true G
Comin down the boulevard 
Can they see me swangin swangin swang till we live
Pop my trunk and give give give
Niggaz betta see a nigga roll
Starched down and I'm rollin on eighty fours
If the nigga FAT represent the click 
Right up in the bowl and a whole lotta shit
Betta look around cause they don't understand it
I'ma say, ""Hold up!"" and scream, ""God dammit!""
Cause I'ma let the cat gone grip and gone take a trip
And it's the empty clip just throw it off the ship 
Cause it's a throwaway gat

DJ DMD,"[Chorus]
Daddy, daddy wasn't home, so momma raised me
And I'm still mommas baby
Daddy, daddy wasn't home, so momma raised me
And I'm still mommas baby
Daddy, daddy wasn't home, so momma raised me
And I'm still mommas baby
Daddy, daddy wasn't home, so momma raised me
And I'm still mommas baby

March 11, 1981
My momma gave birth to a hell raising heavenly son
And my daddy was a fool addicted to brown
So he wasn't ever around, but my momma held me down

When me and big sister had nothing to eat
My momma gave up her last trying to make ends meet
She was a school teacher, working to provide for her fam'
Struggling in AA, to submit to gods plan

Them long twelve's steps of hardway are all on your own
No family, few friends, my momma was all alone
She did it for her children, struggling to make a living
And some how we still had food on thanksgiving

When I can barely talk momma taught me to pray
And right then I knew that we'd have a better life some day
She still give up her last just to see me smile
That's the definition of love for you child, I love my momma

[Chorus]

My momma was my role model, I had no father figure
Just a bunch of pipe dreams of being richer
But as times got tougher my life just got rougher
It hurts so bad to see me watch my momma suffer

Its so hard to cope when you so dead broke
So momma used to make me memorize the song quotes
In the middle of a session momma gave god praise
I knew what it meant to struggle at such an early age

Remember them days she barely earned minimum wage
But made sure I had new cloths to start the seventh grade
She met my step father, and walked down the aisle
I praised he sent somebody that would make my momma smile

He raised me as his own, he taught me to be a man
Adopted me and Anne, and gave momma a hand
I just love to see that beautiful smile on momma face
My momma could never be replaced, I love my momma

[Chorus]

20 years of struggling, done came to a close
No more old, torn up, and hand me down cloths
She deserve the best, and never nothing less
No stress, give my momma that Gucci dress

The times were hard but we done made it out the rain
The storm was severe but we overcame the hurricane
Them rainy days seem to last so long
When them times got hard my momma told me be strong

My number 1 supporter ever since day one
And still till this day momma would die for her son
No more slumz, all them rainy days are done
No a days we taking trips to Disney world just for fun

I put you in a Benz take you out that nova
Its been a long rough road, but that bumpy rides over
You raise me from a baby, my number 1 lady
And until the day I'm in my grave, ima stay mommas baby

[Chorus]",25 Lighta's,2014
