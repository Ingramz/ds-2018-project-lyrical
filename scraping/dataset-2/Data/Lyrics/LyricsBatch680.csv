Audrey Assad,"As the dew falls on the blade
You have touched all this fragile frame
And as a mother knows her baby's face
You know me, You know me

As the summer air within my chest
I have breathed You deep down into my breast
And as You know the hairs upon my head
Every thought and every word I've said
Every thought and every word I've said

Savior, You have known me as I am
Healer, You have known me as I was
As I will be in the morning, in the evening
You have known me, yeah, You know me

Oh, and as the exhilaration of autumn's bite
Oh, You have brought these tired bones to brilliant life
And as the swallow knows, she knows the sky
This is how it is with You and I
Oh, this is how it is with You and I

Savior, You have known me as I am
Healer, You have known me as I was
As I will be in the morning, in the evening
You have known me, yeah, You know me

From the fall of my heart to the resurrection of my soul
You know me, God, and You know my ways
In my rising and my sitting down
You see me as I am, oh, see me as I am

And as a lover knows his beloved's heart
All the shapes and curves of her even in the dark
Oh, You have formed me in my inward parts
And You know me, You know me, yes

Savior, You, You have known me as I am
Oh, healer, You have known me as I was
As I will be in the morning, in the evening
You have known

You have known me, in the morning, in the evening
You've known me, God
In the morning, in the evening You have known me
Yeah, You've know me

Audrey Assad,"You dwell in the songs that we are singing,
Rising to the Heavens, rising to Your heart, Your heart.
Our praises filling up the spaces
In between our frailty and everything You are
You are the keeper of my heart

And I'm restless, I'm restless
'Til I rest in You, 'til I rest in You
I am restless, I'm restless
'Til I rest in You, 'til I rest in You
Oh God, I wanna rest in You

Oh, speak now for my soul is listening
Say that You have saved me, whisper in the dark, the dark.
'Cause I know You're more than my salvation
Without you I am hopeless, tell me who You are
You are the keeper of my heart
You are the keeper of my heart

And I'm restless, I'm restless
'Til I rest in You, 'til I rest in You
I am restless, I'm restless

'Til I rest in You, 'til I rest in You, Oh
I wanna rest in You

Still my heart, hold me close
Let me hear, a still small voice
Let it grow, let it rise
Into a shout, into a cry

Still my heart, hold me close
Let me hear, a still small voice
Let it grow, let it rise
Into a shout, into a cry

Audrey Assad,"You could plant me like a tree beside a river
You could tangle me in soil and let my roots run wild
And I would blossom like a flower in the desert
But for now just let me cry

You could raise me like a banner in the battle
Put victory like fire behind my shining eyes
And I would drift like falling snow over the embers
But for now just let me lie

Bind up these broken bones
Mercy bend and bring me back to life
But not before you show me how to die

Set me like a star before the morning
Like a sun that steals the darkness from a world asleep
And I'll illuminate the path You've laid before me
But for now just let me be

Bind up these broken bones
Mercy bend and bring me back to life
But not before You show me how to die
No, not before You show me how to die

So let me go like a leaf upon the water
Let me brave the wild currents flowing to the sea
And I will disappear into a deeper beauty
But for now just stay with me
God, for now just stay with me",Show Me,2010
Audrey Assad,"I'll go when You call me
I run when You tell me where to go
We are desert walkers under shady clouds
Your fire shows there's more of You to know
Let our idols fail, vanity subside
And we will see the beauty in our lives

When You call my name
When You call my name
Send me to the edge of the Earth
Show me what our life is worth
When You call my name

I will wait in the darkest hour
For You will be a light on this road
Lead me out to the ground I've never walked on
Only to rely on You alone
Let our idols fail, vanity subside
And we will see the beauty in our lives

When You call my name
When You call my name
Send me to the edge of the Earth
Show me what our life is worth
When You call my name
When You call my name

This is my Father's world
And to my listening ear
My heart is still at home
When I hear You call my name

When I hear You call my name
When I hear You call my name

Audrey Assad,"We're tossing pennies in the well,
Empty pockets all turned out.
Happy shining blessed are the ones who hunger.

When our poverty is plain,
I'll try to burn it in my brain
Trace a line around your face to paint a picture.

So further up and further in we have nowhere else to go.
As we plant the seeds of toil and tears
It's beauty we have sown.

Blessed are the ones,
Oh blessed are the ones,
Blessed are the hungry ones.

Lets build a house with turned out doors,
So we can share what love affords.
Pour ourselves out like a wine that we’ve been saving.

When our well is running dry,
And when we raise our glasses high
And we’re shining on the faces of the thirsty.

So further up and further in we have nowhere else to go.
But you give us seeds of toil and tears
It's beauty we have sown.

So blessed are the ones,
Oh, blessed are the ones,
Blessed are the thirsty ones.

Yeah

Love is all yeah love is all.
Love is all yeah love is all.
Love is all we need.

So further up and further in we got no place else to go.
And when all we have is what we need its joy that we will sow.

Blessed are the hungry ones.

We are blessed, yeah.",Blessed Are the Ones,2012
Audrey Assad,"I know that the hardest
Part of love is not the
Things I have to give, no

It's what I give up, I'm giving up ground
I'm trading in my solitude for safety now.
All my pride, it doesn't stand a chance against the way you move.
You're tearing up roots & breaking down walls.
I don't stand a chance at all against the way you move.

You're like a lion, standing in my house,
And you're taking off the doors on your way in,
I got nothing left to hide behind.
You're reading all my faith and all my fear in my eyes

All my pride,
You know it doesn't stand a chance against the way you move,
You're tearing up my roots and breaking down walls,
And I don't stand a chance at all against the way you move",The Way You Move,2012

Everyday, it's as if I play a part

Now I see, if I wear a mask
I can fool the world
But I cannot fool my heart

Who is that girl I see, 
Staring straight back at me.
When will my reflection show
Who I am inside.

I am now, 
In a world where I have to hide my heart, 
And what I believe in.
But somehow I will show the world, 
What's inside my heart, 
And be loved for who I am.

Who is that girl I see, 
Staring straight back at me.
Why is my reflection someone I don't know, 
Must I pretend that I'm, 
Someone else for all time, 
When will my reflection show who I am inside.

There's a heart that must be free to fly, 
That burns with the need to know the reason why.

Why must we all conceal, 
What we think, 
How we feel.
Must there be a secret me I'm forced to hide.
I won't pretend that I'm, 
Someone else for all time.
When will my reflection show, 
Who I am inside.
When will my reflection show, 
Who I am inside.",Reflection,2004

You are the one
 
Here as in a daydream
By my side you stand
Here with my tomorrows

Audrey Morris,"I need your love so badly, I love you, oh, so madly
But I don't stand a ghost of a chance with you!
I thought at last I'd found you, but other lovers surround you
And ""I don't stand a ghost of a chance with you!""

You might discover, that I'm the lover meant for you

Audrey Morris,"Oh! Will you never let me be?
Oh! Will you never set me free?
The ties that bound us
Are still around us
There's no escape that I can see
And still those little things remain
That bring me happiness or pain

A cigarette that bears a lipstick's traces
An airline ticket to romantic places
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
A tinkling piano in the next apartment
Those stumbling words that told you what my heart meant
A fair ground's painted swings
These foolish things remind me of you
You came you saw you conquer'd me
When you did that to me
I knew somehow this had to be
The winds of March that make my heart a dancer
A telephone that rings but who's to answer?
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

First daffodils and long excited cables
And candle lights on little corner tables
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
The park at evening when the bell has sounded
The ""Ile de France"" with all the gulls around it
The beauty that is Spring's
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The sigh of midnight trains in empty stations
Silk stockings thrown aside dance invitations
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

Gardenia perfume ling'ring on a pillow
Wild strawb'ries only seven francs a kilo
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
The smile of Garbo and the scent of roses
The waiters whistling as the last bar closes
The song that Crosby sings
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The scent of smould'ring leaves, the wail of steamers
Two lovers on the street who walk like dreamers
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you",These Foolish Things,1984
Audrey Morris,"This town is full of guys
Who think they're mighty wise,
Just because they know a thing or two.
You see them every day
Walkin' up and down Broadway,
Telling of the wonders they can do.
There's con men and there's boosters,
Card sharks and crap-shooters.
They congregate around the Metropole.
They wear fancy ties and laces,
But where do they get their aces?
They all have got an ace down in the hole!

Some of them write to the old folks for coin,
And that is their ace in the hole,
And others have friends on the old Tenderloin;
That's their old ace in the hole.

They'll tell you of trips that they're going to take
From Florida to the North Pole.
The fact is, their name would be mud,
Like a chump playing stud,

I tell you I mean it

That you'd turn away romance
Are you pretending

You know I'm yours for just the taking

Now she seems quite out of place, like a fallen star
Draped around my kitchen sink , Happy as can be

I'm not much to look at, nothing to see
Just glad I'm livin' and lucky to be

She's funny that way.

She should have the very best, Anyone can see

While I worry plan and scheme, Over what to do
Can't help feeling it's a dream, Too good to be true. 

Never had nothin'; no one to care
That's why I seem to have more than my share,
I got a woman, crazy for me,
She's funny that way.

When I hurt her feelings, once in a while,
Her only answer is one little smile,
I got a woman crazy for me.
She's funny that way.

I can see no other way and no better plan,
End it all and let her go to some better man;

It never really mattered too much to me 
I guess I was too blind and I could not see

She's the promise of pearl in a pool of heartache
She's the perfect little truth wrapped in little white lies
Like the wind she will turn
She can state the case now and then
Ignore the truth
When it ain't on her side
When her eyes claim that she's a lady
You better treat her as such
But comfort the little girl when her world gets too rough

If she
If she's the woman that you live for
Make her feel how much you need her
If she's the woman you love

In the moment that your lives touched
There was something in the stars
That made you feel you'd probably die
Just for a good morning in her arms
'Cause you knew you'd seen an angel
And you were sure she'd fly away
But she chose you when she landed
And gave her heart away

So she's your mystery trip into each new tomorrow
She's the first to laugh and she's the worst to cry
She's like the tide 'neath your ship
But all the fall and rise is just a call to dance

And she's always in time
And her love is like a river in a poem
Penned in wine
That takes you floating forever rhyme after rhyme

If she's the woman that you live for
Make her feel how much you need her

The season for the rodeo is over
And he's usually back home this time of year
But I haven't heard a word since
He called me from Santa Fe
Something in his voice said you were stealing him away

New Mexico - have i lost him to your sunset
Do your mountains life him higher than my love
New Mexico - guess we'll have to wait and see
If tomorrow's gonna bring him back to me

He said he'd never seen a place more beautiful
And he talked of maybe moving there someday
Where the stars in the sky shine like diamonds every night
I wonder if he sees those stars in someone else's eyes

He's in a bar, and she's in the bedroom crying
He thinks he'll drown all the hurt that he's feeling inside
A river of tears is washing away her every reason for trying
And the distance between them is silence, anger and pride

They don't talk to each other
They're no longer lovers
They won't even say the three words that could keep love from dying
She needs a shoulder, he needs to hold her
But he's in a bar, and she's in the bedroom crying

He tells the bartender his problems and thanks him for listening
Then he orders more whiskey to have something warm he can hold
She picks up the phone, and calls up a friend, 
And says she wishes she knew what was missing 
Both of them ask the wrong people why their love's growing cold

You say it must be a miracle
Your heart even beats at all
After all that you've been through
You fell for too many promises, every line
And it was you that always took the fall
I know you're hurtin but don't be sad
I'm here to tell you that you've just had

A string of bad love
But don't give up
One good heart could change your luck
You've been tangled up and tied down long enough
Baby let me break the string of bad love

I've done some time on that trail of tears
And I swore I'd never love again so I know what you're going through
I fell in love with a heartbreaker every time
The road took another bend
I got over it, so will you
Have a little hope, you've just been through

So don't give up
One good heart could change your luck
You've been tangled up and tied down long enough

Together we could take a shot
At making a love that won't unwind

Woke up this morning with a smile on my face
I can't believe your memory didn't keep me awake
My heart's not beating the missing you blues
And my eyes ain't crying for you

All those wasted nights I've sat and cried
Waiting for you knowing that you wouldn't come by
I look back and laugh at the fool I've been
I'll never set foot in them shoes again

Don't pace the floor, pull my hair and scream

And sleep comes easy at night

I feel like shouting out I'm over you
I think I'll call my Momma up and tell her the news

Lookin' at this town through older eyes
It's grown much too fat to recognize
There's a freeway up and the park's torn down
There's not a soul that I know around

Has anybody seen Amy
In her tan bare feet on the summertime street
Can her kiss still turn the winter warm
Or is she just a figment of
What I recall of yesterday's love
Has anybody seen Amy anymore

I can't see the stars through the neon lights
But there's still a crowd where the boys hang out at night
The songs I hear from those teenage cars
Still got the beat but they've lost the heart

Can her kiss still turn the winter warm

Whispering the Saviour's name

And my tears, they fell like rain

Cause her daddy had gone far away,
On her little face was a look of despair,

Now Mary was just a plain mother
And bill was just a usual dad
And they had their little family quarrels
(Like everybody else)
But neither one really got mad

Then one day something happened
It was nothing of course
But one word led to another
And the last word led to a divorce

Now here were two grown up people
Who failed to use common sense
They strengthened their own selfish pride
At little Sue's expense

You know she didn't ask to be brought to
This world
To drift from pillar to post
But a divorce never stops to consider
The ones it hurts the most

There'd be a lot more honest loving

If just a few parted parents
Could hear little sue say

Long is the road that leads you
To that beautiful home up there
Is work on your home completed

I heard my mother praying for me

She was kneeling by her bed
And tears of pain were being shed
She said, ""Dear God, please hear my plea""
I heard my mother praying for me

I got my Bible and sat down
And in the Holy Book I found
The way to end this misery
Thank God, my mother prayed for me

I read it on into the night

Audrey Williams,"When everything goes wrong and it seems all hope is gone
I remember how my Savior died, He died there on the cross
So, this world would not be lost, Jesus died for me long ago

Jesus died for me long ago on a hillside far away
He was tortured and slain, God bless His Holy name
Jesus died for me long ago

What pain He suffered there, the holy one, so dear
So that you and I could live, I'll try to repay
For His sufferin' on that day, Jesus died for me long ago

Jesus died for me long ago on a hillside far away
He was tortured and slain, God bless His Holy name
Jesus died for me long ago

As He hung there all alone, His life's blood almost gone
He never stopped prayin' for me, so I'll follow all the way
And live with Him someday, Jesus died for me long ago

Audrey Williams,"I was all alone and drifting on a lonely sea of sin
Nothing but darkness, no sunshine within
I lifted my eyes, to the Lord in the sky
And Jesus remembered me

Jesus remembered me
And so He set me free
Once I was blinded, but now I can see
Glory to God, He remembered me

Now the sun is shining, I'm happy and free
No more sorrow, no troubles to see
I'm going home to glory, my savior to see
Glory to God, He remembered me

Jesus remembered me
And so He set me free
Once I was blinded, but now I can see
Glory to God, He remembered me

When He talked to his disciples at the sea of Galilee
He said He'd remember a mortal like me
I asked for his blessing down on my knees
And glory to God, He remembered me

Then you`ll be judged; by the deeds you have done
On that judgment day; you`ll weep and you`ll cry

When that trumpet sounds; on the sinners below
Not even the angels; in heaven will know

His servants will bring, a ring for my finger

Stuck by the ships,

When lions ate flowers
And your house didn't need a roof.

I daren't dredge it up not while the weather's still cool,
It's a feathered thing, its origins are mixed and untrue,
Once a straw-body, now a lamb-picker, now a clove in a black brew
I think of the peacocks of the gorge and I think of the gryphons they kept in the Tower Zoo,
The unexpected water swept all before it
As it rushed on terrible through 

And left them all dead, and spread through the park,
Amid the myriad mangles of the coming dark 
Of the shadow of a loon, the howl from a bloody craw,
Those strange interruptions don't scare me anymore,
Since all the while the weather was cool I stood at the crumbling edge of the black pool.

Perhaps a pigeon fell off its stool,
I have drowned a conscience or two,
There are palm trees and clouds and the under-sides of drowned blues,
And sometimes the faces of people I think I knew
I know at one time this thing flew,
I have sunk an ambition or two,
Now when I think to drink, then I wonder with who,
I pretend that I'm sitting in the booth with you 

O what a fuckin' sentence, what a fuckin' noise,
I don't know these girls, I don't trust these boys,
And over there in the corner, there hangs a strange bird,
Sings a strange song but it won't be heard,
A song to inquire whither went the milk money
While the darling babes of Toorak were a'yowling for their honey.

How suddenly still, and though the wind blow,
From here we will never leave or go,
And but for a will, and but for companions,
We might go tumbling home below,
To a place at the table, to gamble and settle,

O these men of many colors in their creamy white suits
With their different colored hands dig in the soil for their roots
Of the dreamy conversation that the slender women make
As they sip from slender glasses by the vineyard lake

Says you haven't been working hard enough on your lies

Where there's joy in the living, voices that ring in the air

Where I don't know but when a dog knows it's on him
He doesn't ask why he just goes, when I go my bones will know
To pick up and follow  the wagon that rolls on the cold acre

I don't grow any good anymore though I've seeded my soul
With all kinds of love, that it aches so

Though I wake from them mouthing
They leave me not able to talk
All these dreams are not nightmares
But realms I've been choosing to walk

With my little bag, with my little dog
Who rests on my stomach and barks at the oncoming fog
O but when I go with my lot in tow
Like a vampire carry my piece in the earth
To the place of my death to the plots of my birth

My heart is a cold acre, in my chest is a cold acre
I don't grow any good anymore though I've seeded my soul
With all kinds of love that don't grow in a cold acre

You say ""Let's see where it goes"" but I don't really wanna wait
Ayy, look and listen up
You've been smiling when we fuck
Let's not even think about it, we ain't gotta talk a lot
We get it hotter than the summer, I'll stay with you when it's not
Put the slow jams on, I wanna see you make it pop, ayy
Moving all around the bed like we just toss and turn, ayy
Playin' with the fire, I don't care if I get burned, ayy
I'ma treat you good like you've been waitin' for your turn, ayy
Nothing in the universe feel better than your tongue, ayy

She lookin' so pretty, I wanted a kiss
把beautiful memories 存入我的iPhone X

August Alsina,"She was only 17 when she left home heading of to college
Just the clothes on the back 40 dollars in the pocket
On the couch of a one bedroom apartment
Roommate trynna get her to pop her pussy for dollars
He was only 13 just a lookout on the corner
He started of small couple pills and marihuana
Now he's thinking he should go out on the block 
And see if he can get shit poppin'
He was tired of going in for just a little bit of profit

She fell in love with the ballers and bottles
He fell in love with the block and the Glock
Now he totin the choppers
Why does it seem like nobody want to be lawyers or doctors
Now a days everybody out there trynna be dealers and models

And you ain't a dreamer

And you ain't a dreamer

Now you can find her on a Wednesday
Trickin' and twerking and working so hard for them singles
24 how to get naked
Money she see for the takin'
She gonna take it
Been dancing so long she don't now when she'll be graduatin'
Friends trynna tell her she trippin'
She telling them to stop hatin'
3 years later for he grows into a men
Got a pocket full of money 9mili in his hand
Momma prayin' tryin' make him understand
That they just wanna put him in the system

Choosing her major
Getting some knowledge
He never dreamt about living for something
All that he knew was he was tired of the struggle
She never knew that
She'd ever do that
Now she addicted to the money and the new bags
And now he wish that
He could get back
All the time he lost
Now he pays the cost

Only 4 years old when Biggie got shot

Now we livin' better now, Coogi sweater now
Weather still getting colder, we could change the weather now

Came up in criminal days

But I do what I gotta do
You've been at the bottom, you see the hunger inside of you
Don't say what you won't do

See I done dodged a couple shots
Served a couple blocks
Hit a couple corners tryna shake a couple cops
A broke a couple rules
Didn't graduate from school

See I gotta keep it real with you baby

Came from the projects, nigga
Don't care if it kill me, I die, I'll stay in the projects

Dawg don't forget about me
I'm just trying to shine
And see what I can be
'Cause I can hear them saying

August Alsina,"Word got around that a nigga got shot
Heard a nigga drew down' and he bucked so his ass got popped
We was on my block trying to move these rocks
Trying to stack this cash on the low, gotta duck these cops
We was off third and polock chilling in the back of the tracks
Niggas got packs, trying to get them racks
X5 I was riding in the back with the brother's' round kicking in the gat in my lap
17 had no dreams, drinking four loco's, Sprite and codeine
First class I was so lean, said fuck high-school, so I left Reed

No one told me life would be this way!
I swear nobody told me
Guess this is the game we chose to play
Crazy how it's always been the same!
People dying every day, that ain't nothing new
When you from downtown, downtown!
Out here tryna make a way
I won't let these niggas take me down-down, down!

Riding on these niggas, I be riding, I be riding on 'em
Riding on these niggas, I be riding, I be riding on 'em
Riding on these niggas, I be riding, I be riding on 'em
Riding on these niggas, I be riding, I be riding on 'em

Phone just rang heard a nigga got got
He was over in the East, last thing that he heard six shots
He ain't gettin' no love from the cops, nobody got caught
Real talk when I heard who it was, heart damn near stopped
Somebody done killed my brother, now I gotta get back
Let em know cause a nigga gotta feel that!
Sitting shotgun with the shot gun
When you hear the shots come, nigga don't run!
Already bad, it can only get worse
Hand full of steel cause the shit still hurts
Cut so deep when they put him in the hearse
Never saw 25, had to put him in the dirt

No one told me life would be this way!
I swear nobody told me
Guess this is the game we chose to play
Crazy how it's always been the same!
People dying every day, that ain't nothing new
When you from downtown, downtown!
Out here tryna make a way
I won't let these niggas take me down-down, down!

Riding on these niggas, I be riding, I be riding on 'em
Riding on these niggas, I be riding, I be riding on 'em
Riding on these niggas, I be riding, I be riding on 'em
Riding on these niggas, I be riding, I be riding on 'em

Once upon a time down town in a nine (9th ward)
Where they don't mind dying
Sworn to a life of crime, was a youngin' that only stood 5'5
Big money on his mind, clothes ain't wrinkled while his hands on his iron.
Shot six times right in front of my mom
Kind of 32, man, I'm lucky to survive
On that Pac juice real niggas don't die!
Bitch, I'm from A-town, slang crack on the same set
Blood stains there from a homie with his head cracked
O'Gs like A' wacks they'll be doing this shit way back since A track.
And we yell where the gang at
You can get fame there from the way you're going to bang that
Shoot for the head watch how you aim that
Price on your head and we gonna take that
It's about to go down, you ain't about this then you better go now
Sun going down, keep it going down!
Everybody lay down ski mask down!
All you gonna see is my eyes and my frown
Last thing you hear is my gun going pow
It happens every day round my way
This ain't nothing new you grew up downtown

People dying every day, that ain't nothing new
When you from downtown, downtown!
I'm just trying to make a way,
I won't let these niggas take me down-down, down!

Riding on these niggas, I be riding, I be riding on 'em

I done seen so much shit just from the very bottom

So it was always about just grinding and getting it out tha mud fa me

I just want a nigga to know what I thought

I got an opportunity
It's way bigger than me

'Cause you know God put nigga in a position
For a reason

I was d-block in the street life
Was on my grind so I didn't sleep nights
Used to push rocks out on my block
Saw police lights, I heard the gunshots
I had nowhere to go
At the end of the road
Had to do something fast
Now I ain't running no more

'Cause I found the light at the end of the tunnel
That's why I kept my head high
Instead of selling my faith
Sitting here wishing I would die
Living in hell on earth
Dead last so I couldn't see first
But I knew it wouldn't get worse
So it only got better (better)
And it's getting better
Living in hell on earth
Dead last so I couldn't see first

When I wake up in the morning, the first thing I do is
Wash up, make sure I'm presentable, before I lay one finger tip on you
Every day I'm in the whip with you
Crack them windows, let them look-at-whose come close, get a little whiff of you
My old thing in my newer coupe, ain't nothin' changed
Addicted to that, lifted off that
Every time I hear your name, I'm ready to let that paper flip
I've never been labelled as a trick, but I'll pay for it if I want it
I'm always high, stuck in the moment
Had a convo with one of my homies
Told me 'bout when y'all first met
How viciously you put it on him
I couldn't even get mad about it
I was there, one of my partners got it
Super loud but she's super soft
Softer than a whisper
Ain't no gold digger, but I ain't never seen her 'round no broke niggas
Come smoke with me

We are gathered here today
Paying our respects to bein' broke, hope he's in a better place
'Cause life out here ain't sweet, oh no
I would close my eyes to sleep but didn't dream no more
So I had to make a way for my home, you know
Now I'm in a place where I ain't gotta scheme no more
The good life, I'm done with the hood life
I did what I could but didn't always do what I should and I was misunderstood
So many nights I tried
To hide how I felt, I would cry inside
And I ran through the streets till my feet got tired
'Cause I ain't wanna have my shoes on them power lines

But I made it, and it made me
I know I did wrong, I prayed to God he forgave me
'Cause I made it, and it didn't kill me
So it made me stronger, I pray to God that you feel me, that you feel me

Our father who art in heaven
I pray you free me from my demons and keep me level
I know you kept my out of prison where I was headin'
When I heard someone killed my brother, one-eighty-seven
I hope he made it to your presence, for me he was a blessin'
At least I know he's restin' and he ain't out here stressin'
Tryna get to the good life, and out of this hood life
I pray that my step-pops stay off that crack pipe
So mama could sleep at night, I know it's been hard on her
I was ripping through the streets, it was hard for her
Now I'm up in hotels on the ocean shore
When I was sleepin' on the floor at the corner store

But I made it, and it made me
I know I did wrong, I prayed to God he would save me
'Cause I made it, it didn't kill me
So it made me stronger, I pray to God that you feel me, that you feel me

Bottle after bottle, snatching Belaire out the bucket
Rightin' all my wrongs for these homies out here thuggin'
Pray for benediction, pretty women on my premise
Condo out in Cabo, screaming ""GABOS"" to my nemesis
Gold around my neck I'm ballin' for these final minutes
Nothing lasts forever, for these sins I seek repentance
Shots fired, another gone, I feel that man's pain
Daddy sat me down and said: ""that came with the game""
Shake my head, roll up the window, turnin' up the music
So much anger in these songs for these soldiers that we losin'
A mastermind is one who's feedin' others off his talent
I owe it to my city but it's time I pay my balance
I'm in Holyfield's estate, I started with a pallet
I made my first tape, I gave that shit to Khaled
Thankful for my supporters, everyone that ever bought us
Grateful for every lesson these by any streets taught us

So me and her, can fuck the world

I said she never been to college, got brains
And one thing about it, IQ is insane
My g gon' keep it up, she ain't gon' let it be
Then once she get it started, it might not never end
Hit her on the late night, tell her that I'm 'bout to fall through
Said it's been waitin' on you nigga, get us all you
She got a little paper, might just tell her ""Let me hold some""
I said I'm on my way, you just go ahead and roll one
She said just come through, and I'mma roll a few
And make it stand tall, then I'mma roll on you
If she was Bonnie, I be Clyde, we been down since way back
Swear them lips will be illegal, they addictive like crack (haha)
That's what I told her

I tell her that I need her, she don't believe that
I miss her when she go like ""Where my g at""
In a league of her own, she a bad one
Never felt like this, you never had one
(She bad, I'm fly, we high, and the shit we on nigga fo' life till we die
Till we die, came from the bottom to sing for the sky
If it's mother fuck the world, put your fingers up high, yeah)

When these streets is all you know
(All you know baby)
It's hard to tell whose a friend or a foe
(No question)
All I need is a beautiful girl
(Yeah wassup)
So me and her, can fuck the world
Middle finger with our legs in the air
Gettin' money so it's hard to care

August Alsina,"I remember wakin' up, being broke
But still it wasn't breakin' us
I remember why I broke the rules,
Cuz I ain't really have nobody to look up to
I remember cuttin' class, bein' bad,
Cuz I ain't have what them other kids had
I remember wishin' that I knew my dad,
Then I remember wishin' I could get him back
For every single night that he told me he was comin' and he didn't,
For every single dollar that my mama 'nem was missin'
For every thing I wanted and was told I couldn't get it,
And that I had to face it that my daddy was addicted (damn)
That's right it wasn't easy growin' up,
Mama was exposin' us to life as she knew it
So we all went through it,
I remember bein' down and out, sleepin', on my homie's couch
In & outta trouble ever since my mama put me out

Damn it's getting real, damn it's getting real
Didn't graduate, I'm thinking damn I gotta deal
So I hit da block, selling rocks just to eat a meal
So I grabbed da Glock, kept it cocked
Peace is being still

In da back of da tracks, my nigga's stayed wit da packs
And if a nigga was schemin', my brotha stayed with tha gat
Yea, yea we stayed in da trap, yea everyday in da trap
These ho's was chasin' da cheese, so we would stay wit da rat's
And we was ridin' down, dippin' low, I stayed in da back
In the X5 stuntin', we ain't know how to act
Spendin' money like it's nothin', cuz we gone get it back
17 never thought that I'd be gettin' dem racks,
Had a dream but I said I wasn't fuckin' wit that
Mel told me I would make it, I ain't fuckin' wit that
But he told me that it wouldn't hurt to give it a try
Hardest thing out in New Orleans never see 25

Right then I woke up, broke out, told my nigga's had to roll out,
Moved to the A and got motivated, that inspiration don't run out
Heard my brother got gunned down and it hurt me to my heart,
So I kept grindin', I kept pushin', he told me to go far
So I can't stop at no crib, can't stop at no car,
Gotta keep going like there ain't no tomorrow
So I'm goin' hard everyday, 'til I got nothin' to say, nothin' can stand in my way,
I gotta stay, to show my nigga's a different way

Imma tell da truth and da whole truth,
Cuz there ain't no need to lie
And I ain't tryna keep it all inside,
So I gotta testify
For you and I, I testify

Imma tell da truth and da whole truth,

Imagining herself in the wifey position

Somebody probably say you wouldn't be nothin'
I bet they told you this over and over again on repeat like a re-run
Nobody ever told you you could live up
To anything you want, don't give up
They rather tell you, you're destined for failure
That's what they tell you
But you just say
What about Martin?
What about Garvey?
What about Rosa?
What about Malcolm?
What if somebody told them they would never be nothin'
And they believed this, think about the outcome
Would we even be the way we are today?
Even if it weren't, could have been a harder way
Even though we lost a lot of people on the way
Had to sacrifice to get us in a better place

I hope you listen to these wizzords
All they want us thinking about is sipping on some sizzurp
And they got us thinking something better we don't deserve
And that you shouldn't try, it's no use
But that couldn't be further from the truth
Don't believe it, that's what they told me too
When I was growing up (They told me)
They told me (That I wouldn't make it too far)
And when I battle it'll hold up
(They told me) They told me, yeah
(That I wouldn't be anything)

That's what they tell, what they tell, what they tell
When we were little ones
That's what they tell, what they tell, what they tell

They say the ballers is celebrities 
As a reminder of the people they would never be
Jealousy got 'em sick without a remedy
Thinking when I die nobody's gonna remember me
I was told that nobody care
So the dreams that I had turned to nightmares
Is this thing called life really fair
Need help but it ain't there
So you know it's really hard to stay dedicated
When the ballers screaming they was never educated
On the corner getting high just to medicate it
'Cause the teachers just told him he would never make it
Now he feeling like he made it 'cause he stackin' paper
But probably won't let him spend the money later
Nobody ever told us we could be greater
To everybody on the grind and the paper chasers

Like when lovers turning cocaine to pot
I went through the soda straight out the box
Hoping when this shit drop it will rock, hoping when my shit drop it will rock

'Cause ain't shit changed even since my nigga Pac got banged
Some of the players switched up and it's the same old game
I see no change, so I guess I gotta be that change
I'm just out here doing what I gotta do
Showing young niggas how to make it through
'Cause I had to get it out the muscle, I can never loose the hustle
'Cause I represent the struggle a change
Guess now you can see there's a better way

We could be that change
Make the whole world change
We could be that change
We could be that change
We could be that change

So many people outchea with nowhere to go
Mother's loosing their children for reasons nobody know
Places with no suns and nothing can grow
And people in poverty wishing they could be more
Making brand new kicks can make you rich
I rather be in brand new whips than pay our rent
Single momma's got 4 kids the income's fixed
Baby daddy's out on bond, still ain't shit
Never took the time to notice
The person in the reflection is the real focus
If we could change with them then I'll notice
Historically ain't nobody looking out for us
all they ever had was doubt for us

Cause ain't shit changed even since my nigga Pac got banged
Some of the players switched up and it's the same old game
I see no change, so I guess I gotta be that change

Yeah I'm guilty of daydreamin'
That I could change the world

Gave up they stopped believin'
They just stopped dreamin'",Change,2015

'Cause I ain't tryna get laid off
Won't stop until the day that I'm a boss

I know somebody tired of assisted living
Waking every morning saying ""I gotta get it""
Focus on the paper can give you tunnel vision
Drug dealing, stacking, flipping just tryna make a living
Baby shaking on the pole just to make tuition
Single mommas facing drama so they can feed they children
Niggas strung out on that dope just cause they had a taste
And niggas dropping out of school on the paper chase
Who am I to hate? I ain't judging 'cause I can relate
Skipping school, getting high, just tryna motivate
Tryna make it 'til I make it to them pearly gates
Lost so many of my homies can't face another wake
Another lost, another cop, another mistake
Nothing standing in my way 
I went through a hurricane of pain and I'm standing today

Just pay attention and concentrate

Yeah niggas it's crunch time

Yeah, I'm speaking real so you gon' believe me
First of all nobody said that it was gon' be easy
And you don't see the pain, you just see what's on the TV
When you don't let them keep the change then they call you greedy
Now they on social media talking greezy
Would get the guns but my sons and my daughters need me
I get it off soon as it comes, make your order speedy
I'm on a hell of a run, I thank the Lord completely
I'm putting overtime in so I'm sorta sleepy
And I haven't slept in years so that's sorta creepy

August Alsina,"Not a day goes by, I don't think to myself
And remember the times there was no one else
I felt so alone, there was pain that I felt
'Cause even self made niggas don't wanna do it by themselves
I looked to the hills, someone's coming for help
And he gave me the will when there was nothing left
Lord knows that I cried, Lord knows that I cried
Those nights I couldn't eat, had to swallow my pride
But through it all, one thing remained
I kept it real, I stayed the same
And I made it through a lot of pain
Had a lot of sleepless nights, but still I have to fight
So I went and got it out the dirt
When they told me it would never work
And the bad just kept on getting worse
Had to tell myself a few words from the heart

Look at how far I've come and I'm here, y'all
If you think nobody feels you, best believe I know
Look, I can't turn back now when they've killed y'all
And I can't pay all these bills, y'all, better know one thing for sure
Look at how far I've come, even though I'm outchea stressing
Still I gotta do my best and let it go
So I know I can't look back now
I gotta keep pressing on, 'til I make it, somehow

I know some days you feel like giving up
Feel like time is running out and all you have is doubt
Tryna keep your head up, but you fed up, tryna stack your bread up
Like how come the outcome of my income isn't dough comin'?
No one is helpin', they just out for they-self
Outchea tryna make a way, hoping there's a better day
And when you think that you're done
And the storm is raging
Look through the clouds and you can see the sun
Sometimes I know it's hard and life can have you stressing
But you should count your blessings, and every single lesson you've learned
It takes hard work in getting it out the dirt
But how could you know pleasure, if you never knew hurt?
We all go through our share of pain, ups and downs
For reasons that I can't explain
But when it's all said and done
And you think you've run as far as you can run

Look at how far I've come and I'm here, y'all
If you think nobody feels you, best believe I know
Look, I can't turn back now when they've killed y'all
And I can't pay all these bills, y'all, better know one thing for sure
Look at how far I've come, even though I'm outchea stressing
Still I gotta do my best and let it go
So I know I can't look back now
I gotta keep pressing on, 'til I make it, somehow

I remember we was sitting on the aisle
Wish I could take it back to the days we lost

Every day's a gamble
I know you can't win 'em all
But that don't stop the hurt at all

Two times for my gangstas who ain't here with us no more

What's this shit really about, how did I even get here?

O tidings of comfort and joy

And laid within a manger
Upon this blessed morn
The which His Mother Mary
Did nothing take in scorn

And unto certain Shepherds
Brought tidings of the same
How that in Bethlehem was born

Of a pure Virgin bright
To free all those who trust in Him
From Satan's power and might""

Comfort and joy
O tidings of comfort and joy

The shepherds at those tidings
Rejoiced much in mind
And left their flocks a-feeding
In tempest, storm and wind
And went to Bethlehem straightway
The Son of God to find
O tidings of comfort and joy
Comfort and joy
O tidings of comfort and joy

And when they came to Bethlehem
Where our dear Saviour lay
They found Him in a manger
Where oxen feed on hay

Unto the Lord did pray

O tidings of comfort and joy

It’s painful, it's tough, I never saw it coming

And kicks you to the curb

You wronged me, you crossed me, I’ll never let it ruin me
Lessons are learned deep down within my heart, in my heart

The past is a part of me

There had to be a dove that was out there for him
He be madly in love and then go to boredom
His own issues, he would ignore 'em
And pour 'em into work and being so called free
Now imagine this bird being me
I always thought, ""I'm the one to fly free""
Played the game and handled it like Kyrie
Looking past my exes like I'm YZ
Not thinking, ""Why me?"" 'cause she cry me a river
I'm thinking bigger, looking for the perfect picture
Takes much practice, I was in love with an actress, a singer, and a tennis player
Star Wars of love, every princess had a Leia
'Don't commit' city, you could say I was the mayor
Am I built for relationships and marriages?
Questions I had for my aunt and a therapist
Checking in and out of Heartbreak Hotel, man
Bag lady, I'm the bellman

The rains have fallen, come at all
I had a run, some close calls
I lost and played the game, I lost and played the game
Been lost for many days, feel like I'm stuck in place

August Greene,"There's places I know I can't tell you about
There's things I have done I can't carry around
I need to let go, I need to let go

Sittin' in a shadow of me, gradually battlin' me
A fall from grace like Adam and Eve
Search for the inner-Vatican in me
The temple, the body, I'm mental, I'm godly
Somehow I made my mess-ups my hobby
Is it the stress and the pressure? Probably
Out here with much anger inside me
Don't know who my friends are, stranger inside me
Stranger things, gettin' high clipped off my angel wings
Thought I was gonna fly when Obama became the king
Pain and distain are the rings that I wear
It's just the price of life when things ain't as fair
To pay dues and you still owe something on 'em
When you bruised they still want something from you
Run through my mind, trippin' over time
It's moving faster than me, haphazardously
So much drive that I crashed into me
Father, will time be my last enemy?
What will my soul be worth when you cash in on me
I'm bent, prayin' on passionate knee

There's places I know I can't tell you about
There's things I have done I can't carry around
I need to let go, I need to let go
In a state, within a place
Whatever works, I get appraised
Don't want to wait for Heaven's gates
But hellish things, there's too much weight
I need to let go, I need to let go

The best souls reach thresholds and can't let go
Empty room, wishin' for a miracle to echo
In my mind I hear times can stay ghetto
Born rebel, havin' my own inner-Allepo
Saved by the blood then I should be a vessel
Just another Jacob, with God I wrestle
I deal with the Devil, temptations hey ay
Tryin' to get the spirit right, reflection's in the way
How many lesson in a day do I need
Before I get on my demons, see the fruit of my seed?
It was written, I read, I keep gettin' Rocky'd
In a fight with my mind, from these decisions, I bleed
I'm supposed to go high when they go low
I forget the big picture and snap like a photo
Solo in a crowded room, seein' myself like a powdered room
In my eyes clouds of doubt and gloom
Between me and the sun, it's weed in a gun
I yell freedom 'cause I'm free to be dumb
When it's all done, will I have heaven's dress code?
And being able to let god and let go

There's places I know I can't tell you about
There's things I have done I can't carry around
I need to let go, I need to let go

August Greene,"I met a little boy, he asked, ""Where are we now?""
I met a little girl she asked if I was proud
Of what I had become and what the world would allow
I might put a fight but yet in still I'm losing ground
If a tree falls in the forest and no one hears a sound
Did it ever really happen at all? Did it ever really happen at all?
I'll tell you this, I put the work in daily, so it's my belief, I can't fall

As we go into the well of the black pool of genius, August Greene
Time meets worth, rhymes beats birth of a new day, born again
Good morninin' these beginings never form an end
Crowns of righteousness not to see the thorns again
I argue with my aura, am I born to win or born to sin?
Maybe both, contribute to daily growth, oath is taken like Liam Neeson
Somebody take my daughter, they goin' cease from breathin'
They body snatchin' black girls in DC
Politics and propaganda on the TV
Distractions, distractin' us from action
It's time for some, time for some passion
There's no time for patience or time for communication
Or time for formation, a time when it's overflow, a time when it's wastin'
They say time is on our side like a hip replacement
The shine that I wear is from them times in the basement
A time to rebuild, a time to be ill, a time to be still, a time that we heal
On the  mountain top, the youth from the fountain dropped
Thoughts about being forever young, it's like a deacon that forever sung
With the choir, this is praise and worship, everyday's a circus
I walked the tight rope, tryna find a way to work it
Yessua paid for our sins, that's the greatest purchase
To keep it 100, we made imperfect
What I strive for, is what I live for
Studied the lessons, now the lesson is to give more
And endure trials with style like Johnnie Cochran
I rap with a gift that can't be boxed in, winnin' is the doctrine
Starin' time in the face, I guess that I'm a watchman
My father created time, yes I'ma watch him
Locked in, tryna get out of a sunken place
A blackness that ain't defined by a time and space",Meditation,2018

School days, I'm the principal, still wannabes and jiggaboos
Light-skin, field nigga dues, don't question me, no interviews
It's gonna take a miracle to change the block and that's spiritual
Tactics for black kids, it's mind over matter, where blacks is
It's captive where the trap is, the ghetto is radioactive
The struggle's attractive, made moves and backslid
So I could back, give, way back to Jackson
See blacks were passion, blacks in fashion, in fact the rash it
Now it was style, it was loud, it was proud
Endowed by the clout of the people's profile

Heaven opened it's door and warned us to Chica-go in

The wind keep blowin', street sweepin' and sowin'
Rollin' with my stolen moments, am I

Free and pain are identical, intervals of an inner-school
Lyrical what the spirit do, miracles when I interview

Demented a dimension and extensions of a man
Intention of divine intervention in a plan

The son of man gave me a tan, that's who I am

Everyday I pray I stay my course, hopin' my actions obey my thoughts

And for me to learn me 'til the judge adjourned me
I'm the attorney of a universal law
Fill out a application and I gotta circle raw, aww

Living in temptation, living in resistance
Got to know persistence, it helped me travel the distance
Now in a battle, I find what bliss is
Got a wish list for my people at the crib to get it right, right, right
Got a wish list for my people at the crib that we can get it right, right, right

Sleeping in my burlap sack
And all the mosquitos know I love you
Can I love me just as much
And I had breakfast with my shadow
We had quite the discussion
Can you fall in love with the things you only know the things you may never touch?

My day at work was just like it always is
The same old same old
I appreciate the opportunity over and over

But sooner or later babe, you're gonna need me around

The fool in me
It's like a dream, you see
But if the world is right
I'll drive all night
And meet you there someday

Six in the morning, never felt so sweet
Just put on Lucinda baby, and dance with me
I know I'm hard to count on
Forget half what I'm told
You probably only know my voice from
A goddamn microphone

It's a waste
A teenage taste of me
But if Daddy cries
Just say goodnight

And the sun would shine every night
And I'll come meet you there someday",Meet You There,2008

Standing tall in your white gown,

With a cold gun, in your wrong hand,
Get it right this time, get it off your mind,
Let the summer rain bring you rest
And shame and love

Carve your name in a black stone,
Swear to god we won't let go,
If you cant love babe, then you cant hurt,
We take the good times, with the worst,
Take your time honey, take your time.

Down a road that's leading me nowhere

The place where I am free?
Cause in my mind I need it
But you're nowhere near to me

Move to New York City
Take your woman by the hand
Leave her there with your things on the doorstep
And there's no way around it
Could this be our last dance?
So fall asleep with the t.v. darling
I'll be back again

The place where I am free?

And there's no one here but me

In the morning it'll find you
Let the light shine away

I took myself one Friday evening
To think on a son so deceiving
It's one drink down and another to go

He was married in haste to a woman unchaste
Much to the shame of the father
His face still half-covered in lather
It's one drink down and another to go

It's one drink down and another to go
When I pass through the town I must hang my head low
It's one drink down and another to go

I'm not the kind to condemn out of hand
A woman whose virtue is easy
Just as long as she doesn't deceive me
It's one drink down and another to go

Imagine a life with an unfaithful wife
Might wake up in the morning
And find that she's left without warning

But Christmas in the sand don't end
I tell you that's where it's at

Hawaiian Tropic on my skin
A candy cane of peppermint, a hint
Of cocoa on my lips

It could've been the sun
It could've been the sea
It could've been my childhood fantasy

I saw Santa in his bathing suit
Tried to catch a wave, but he tried to soon
He laughed so hard that he could barely breathe
And washed up next to me

He said that you look naughty
But I'm sure you're nice
He was soaking wet but he cracked a smile
With a present in his hand
He said it's Christmas in the sand

I must have had too much to drink
'Cause Rudolph's nose was shining green, I think
He was playing reindeer games on me
Santa only called him once
But you should've seen him run so fast
They were gone in a dash

It could've been the sun
It could've been the sea
It could've been my childhood fantasy

I saw Santa in his bathing suit
Tried to catch a wave, but he tried to soon
He laughed so hard that he could barely breathe
And washed up next to me

He said that you look naughty
But I'm sure you're nice
He was soaking wet but he cracked a smile
With a present in his hand
He said it's Christmas in the sand

Christmas in the sand, whoa
Christmas in the sand, whoa
Christmas in the sand, whoa
Christmas in the sand, whoa

Don't need your winter coat
Don't need your winter hat
Just grab the one you love
And say you're never coming back

If you see Santa in his bathing suit
Tried to catch a wave, but he tried to soon
He laughed so hard that he could barely breathe
It's what he did to me

He said that you look naughty
But I'm sure you're nice
He was soaking wet but he cracked a smile

Will find it hard to sleep tonight

They know that Santa's on his way
He's loaded lots of toys and goodies on his sleigh

To see if reindeer really know how to fly

It's too easy to get tempted

Cinnamon cider, sparkling diamonds
Presents too big for the tree
So much shopping, there's no time left
For my friends and my family

Maybe we worry too much about wishing
And not enough about giving
'Cause some people have nothing at all

Giving is priceless
Random acts of kindness
Remember the homeless
'Cause this is Christmas

Give hope to the hopeless
Love to the loveless
Remind us to be selfless
'Cause this is Christmas

So here's my happy Christmas to you
(Happy Christmas)
Here's my happy Christmas to you

So let just spend some time together
And be grateful that we're safe and warm
That our house is filled with songs and laughter
We gather by the fire making s'mores

It's caring and sharing
All of the good things
Not taking anything for granted
That we have

Giving is priceless
Random acts of kindness
Remember the homeless
'Cause this is Christmas

Give hope to the hopeless
Love to the loveless
Remind us to be selfless
'Cause this is Christmas

So here's my happy Christmas to you
(Happy Christmas)
Here's my happy Christmas to you

I remember Christmas day
We'd go run outside and play
Easy snow, snow fight, snowman
Skating on the ice holding grandpa's hand

I'm just asking for one thing
Let's keep making memories
Can we stay whole together, please?
By the Christmas tree

Giving is priceless
Random acts of kindness
Remember the homeless
'Cause this is Christmas

Give hope to the hopeless
Love to the loveless
Remind us to be selfless
'Cause this is Christmas

So here's my happy Christmas to you

Then pretend that he is Parson Brown

We'll say, no man
But you can do the job
When you're in town

Later on, we'll conspire
As we dream by the fire
To face unafraid
The plans that we've made

In the meadow we can build a snowman
And pretend that he's a circus clown
We'll have lots of fun with mister snowman
Until the other kids go knock him down

When it snows, ain't it thrilling
Though your nose gets a chilling
We'll frolic and play, the Eskimo way

Auli‘I Cravalho,"I've been staring at the edge of the water
'Long as I can remember, never really knowing why
I wish I could be the perfect daughter
But I come back to the water, no matter how hard I try
Every turn I take, every trail I track
Every path I make, every road leads back
To the place I know, where I can not go, where I long to be

See the line where the sky meets the sea? It calls me
And no one knows, how far it goes
If the wind in my sail on the sea stays behind me
One day I'll know, if I go there's just no telling how far I'll go

I know everybody on this island, seems so happy on this island
Everything is by design
I know everybody on this island has a role on this island
So maybe I can roll with mine
I can lead with pride, I can make us strong
I'll be satisfied if I play along
But the voice inside sings a different song
What is wrong with me?

See the light as it shines on the sea? It's blinding
But no one knows, how deep it goes
And it seems like it's calling out to me, so come find me
And let me know, what's beyond that line, will I cross that line?

The line where the sky meets the sea? It calls me
And no one knows, how far it goes

But no one knows, how far it goes
All the time wondering where I need to be is behind me
I'm on my own, to worlds unknown

Every turn I take, every trail I track
Is a choice I make, now I can't turn back
From the great unknown, where I go alone, where I long to be

Auli‘I Cravalho,"I know a girl from an island
She stands apart from the crowd
She loves the sea and her people
She makes her whole family proud
Sometimes the world seems against you
The journey may leave a scar
But scars can heal and reveal just
Where you are
The people you love will change you
The things you have learned will guide you
And nothing on earth can silence
The quiet voice still inside you
And when that voice starts to whisper
Moana, you've come so far
Moana, listen
Do you know who you are?

Who am I?
I am a girl who loves my island
I'm the girl who loves the sea
It calls me
I am the daughter of the village chief
We are descended from voyagers
Who found their way across the world
They call me
I've delivered us to where we are
I have journeyed farther
I am everything I've learned and more
Still it calls me
And the call isn't out there at all, it's inside me
It's like the tide; always falling and rising
I will carry you here in my heart you'll remind me
That come what may
I know the way

Moana, it's time you knew
The village of Motunui is
All you need

The dancers are practising
They dance to an ancient song
(Who needs a new song? This old one's all we need)

This tradition is our mission
And Moana, there's so much to do (make way!)
Don't trip on the taro root
That's all you need

We share everything we make (we make)
We joke and we weave our baskets (aha!)
The fishermen come back from the sea

I wanna see

Don't walk away
Moana, stay on the ground now
Our people will need a chief
And there you are

There comes a day
When you're gonna look around
And realize happiness is
Where you are

Consider the coconut (the what?)
Consider its tree
We use each part of the coconut
That's all we need

We make our nets from the fibers (we make our nets from the fibers)
The water is sweet inside (the water is sweet inside)
We use the leaves to build fires (we use the leaves to build fires)
We cook up the meat inside (we cook up the meat inside)

Consider the coconuts (consider the coconuts)
The trunks and the leaves (ha!)
The island gives us what we need

And no one leaves

That's right, we stay
We're safe and we're well provided
And when we look to the future
There you are

You'll be okay
In time you'll learn just as I did
You must find happiness right
Where you are

I like to dance with the water
The undertow and the waves
The water is mischievous (ha!)
I like how it misbehaves

The village may think I'm crazy
Or say that I drift too far
But once you know what you like, well
There you are

You are your father's daughter
Stubbornness and pride
Mind what he says but remember
You may hear a voice inside
And if the voice starts to whisper
To follow the farthest star
Moana, that voice inside is
Who you are

We make our nets from the fibers (we weave our nets from the fibers)
The water is sweet inside (and we taste the sweet inside)
We use the leaves to build fires (we sing these songs in our choir)
We cook up the meat inside (we have mouths to feed inside)

The village believes in us (that's right!)
The village believes (ha!)
The island gives us what we need
And no one leaves

So here I'll stay
My home, my people beside me
And when I think of tomorrow
There we are

I'll lead the way
I'll have my people to guide me
We'll build our future together

Aurelio Fierro,"My mind is clearer now
At last
All too well
I can see
Where we all
Soon will be
If you strip away
The myth
From the man
You will see
Where we all
Soon will be

Jesus
You've started to believe
The things they say of you
You really do believe
This talk of God is true

And all the good you've done
Will soon be swept away
You've begun to matter more
Than the things you say

Listen Jesus
I don't like what I see
All I ask is that you listen to me
And remember
I've been your right hand man all along
You have set them all on fire
They think they've found the new Messiah
And they'll hurt you when they find they're wrong

I remember when this whole thing began
No talk of God then, we called you a man
And believe me
My admiration for you hasn't died
But every word you say today
Gets twisted 'round some other way
And they'll hurt you if they think you've lied

Nazareth's most famous son
Should have stayed a great unknown
Like his father carving wood
He'd have made good
Tables, chairs and oaken chests
Would have suited Jesus best
He'd have caused nobody harm
No one alarm

Listen Jesus, do you care for your race?
Don't you see we must keep in our place?
We are occupied
Have you forgotten how put down we are?
I am frightened by the crowd
For we are getting much too loud
And they'll crush us if we go too far
If we go too far

Listen Jesus to the warning I give
Please remember that I want us to live
But it's sad to see our chances weakening with every hour
All your followers are blind
Too much heaven on their minds
It was beautiful, but now it's sour
Yes it's all gone sour
Ah ah ah ah ah
God Jesus, it's all gone sour

Listen Jesus to the warning I give
Please remember that I want us to live
So come on, come on, listen to me
Ah ah
Come on, listen, listen to me
Come on and listen to me
Ah ah",Serenata a margellina,2012

Gotta do it my way
Hush baby, don't talk so much
Just wanna feel ya touch
Everything will be OK
If you do it my way (my way, my way)

You feel so good
Rest of my life I wish I could
Hold you tight and take a flight out the hood
Was I foul or just misunderstood?
Mind-mannered or up to no-good
It really doesn't matter, either way I should
Maximize the moment and hold ya close
Jump in the drop spider and cruise down the coast
Who loved you the most?
I was never ghost
When lives was on the line
Confusion in ya mind
Runnin' outta time
Drama of all kind
But there's faith in our mind
We spiritually inclined
Sometimes I flip
Sometimes you flip
Sometimes we wild out and act like lunatics
We movin' too fast, the whole world's in a rush
Everybody just hush

If you do it my way (my way, my way)

Its all a test, the pain, the drama
The villa in the Bahamas
The highs, the lows
The hoop-t, the Rolls
The money flowin'
Certain doors that we go in
The people we meet, the hands that we shake
Whether its Mortans or Sizzla steak
But everything will be okay
[w/ 7 Aurelius] if we do it my way
'cause I believe in romance
Kissin' while ya slow dance
Me bouncin' baby? no chance
No matter the circumstance
Whatever it takes girl, ill swim to France
'cause ya beauty's unmatched
Such a great catch
Unconditional love, forever we are attached
Deal with the drama, we can find our way back
With or without the Maybach

I can feel ya pain
Like we Siamese twins connected by our brains
Walkin' through the desert in the ice cold rain
Want you in my life and nothin's gonna change
God willin', we still be doin' our thing
When my six-pack's faded
Raps outdated
But that's many years from now so don't rush
Little mama just hush

This is how its gonna go

I want to thank you for being so honest
And genuine when we speak about feelings
Now maybe 
(Now maybe) 
We have more than we figured
We've got more innocent thoughts that trigger romance
I'll take my chances

Here under these stars I feel waves crash
Here inside my car Erica is unmasked

Hey baby, I want to thank you for seeing
(I want to thank you)
What is honest and genuine in our mutual feelings
Now maybe 
(Now maybe)
It's no more than we figured

Auryn,"[Chorus]
Babe, you know it gets no better than this,
It's like sunshine on a rainy day,
It's like a, ""How could you take me away?""
""Take me away.""
""Away.""
It's a beautiful bliss.
When you feel like this (beautiful bliss)
When you spill out hits (beautiful bliss)
When you fly as a bitch
And you ride with tits
And you aint bothered a bit now baby.

Fresh out the airport
Fresh out the tan with the clippers
Like Sean Lippet thinking, hmm
I'm trying to get it like Sean get it
If lord giveth a mill and a milf like skibbit
Its slight blemishes and life system
But I'm giving it foundation when I write lyric
That anvil night hard mine is bright knickers
Maybe not quite the star but my hearts in it
When Brett Hart meet Brett Favre
A sharp shooter well exceeding any figure four
You see my figure more or less stick some more
On your vest then my larynx and lungs and this voice I project
My pro-ject is like what pros inject
And niggas so fly I should be droved in jets
It's ironic they call me a fresh breath no joke
You see them boys sign me to the 'Scope, right?

[Chorus]

I fall whole to the real they wanna know just how it feel
Who woulda thought a lil' nigga 
From the ville could get a deal
And tell them niggas at the top 
We want yo spot we are for real
And yet we heard you got it locked 
But like them socks we on your heels
So you best be on your toes nigga
Especially on your flows nigga
'Cause man they keep on checking 
For me especially all your hoes nigga
Catch me on your doorstep
You see me let me in
All I wanna' do is eat
I'm like the freaky lesbian
Know all I wanna' do is ball on TV knee E.S.P.N.
They heard I'm bout to blow so all my enemies say, ""Let's be friends.""
And all these rappers know just where I'm 'bout to go so catch me then
Where all the girls that we knew scream, ""Fuck you""
Gon' let me in
I'm definitely in a class of my own
And dinner with Hov
Hoping that he pass the baton
He just pass the Patron
And he ain't givin' dog is earned
If you just live in dog you learn
I let you niggas see the light
I'm like the prison yard I yearn
For that living large but mama I ain't done yet
Sit back and watch your son rise
Kick back and know your son set
Forever I ain't run yet
And never will
Nas told me life's a bitch
Pac said, ""Fuck the world and I ain't come yet.""
You up yet?
My punchlines like gut checks
I'm raw dog
I'm rough sex
I'm on deck
I'm up next
I'm godbless
I'm success
So fuck stress
You can get the fuck from around me
And if you listening know you wondering
Where the fuck they found me
I'm from the ville boy
(Aye Wale, good looking.)

[Chorus]

Another day up in my ES
Wish it was an LS
But elastic is my wallet
Fuck it
I don't be stressed like relaxed muscles
Your feedback ain't flexing
Then you can keep it running
Like a muffler
When we not in summer
They like A list actors
They not no stunners
Too much practice now for me to malfunction
So any beat that function
I breathe on and puncture
Leave it like a female Dijon a puncture
Waiting showing you her beauty if she's naked
It's like the view of a paintin' or a lakehead
This shits how beautiful my day is
Peep me how I'm raising up the capital for Nathan
Capital I'm raising like I'm through punctuating
Or shift keys or it I placement 'cause
Shift the keys get your capital raised up

Austin Lounge Lizards,"The curtain of darkness is fallin?
And my friends are all here at my side.
Are those the sweet voices of angels
As I rise on that heavenly tide?

All hearts overflowin? with sadness
And those words left so often unsaid
Then I could hear a voice whispering softly,
?Could I have all your stuff when your dead??

?Could I have your TV and your pickup?
And I?ve always admired your shoes.
Could I have that old dining room table?
And there?s a couple of chairs I could use.?

?Well, you know that you?re headed to glory,
And like a star, up to heaven you?ll shoot
When they write the last page of your story,
Could I try on that seersucker suit??

It was the voice of my dear brother Thomas.
He was kneelin? down close by my side.
His breath had just come from a funeral
For a mouth full of teeth that had died.

Well, I prayed my last prayer for salvation.
I was feelin? the touch of God?s hand.
But I could still hear the voice of my brother
As they struck up that old angel band.

?Could I have your old ski boots and surf board?
And maybe that four-poster bed?
Would you mind if I took a few records?
Just Nirvana, The Stones, and the Dead.?

Well, you know that you can?t take it with you
To your heavenly home up on high.
When you pass through those gates, and they had you your wings,
Could I have all your stuff when you die?

But the angels consulted St. Peter
And flew me back to my hospital bed.
My life was a new day a-dawning,
And the angels took Tommy instead.

Did you have a good time in Berlin

And ask if it all could be finished tonight

All that smoke doesn't look very good""

And we're proud to be Americans, until we can secede

One more stupid song about Texas
   You've heard it all before so sing along 
   Biggest belt buckles and boasts, love that big old Texas toast
   Let's sing another stupid Texas song

Our accents are the drawliest, our howdies are the y'alliest
Our lone star flag's the waviest, our fried steak's the cream-graviest 
Our rattlesnakes the coiliest, our beaches are the oiliest 
Our politicians most corrupt, our stop signs most abrupt

Our guitars are the twangiest, our guns are the kablangiest
Our cattle the long-horniest, our yodels the forlorniest
Our cookoffs are the chiliest, our Waylon is the Williest
Our sausage is the smokiest, our neighbors are the Okiest

From Texarkana to El Paso, Dalhart down to Orange 
Every spot in Texas has got what you're looking for 
Aren'cha glad that Texas put the stars up in the sky
If heaven isn't Texas, pardner, I don't want to die 

One more stupid song about Texas
   Just 'cause we're braggin', that don't mean it's wrong 
   Biggest heads and biggest hearts, biggest various body parts
   Let's sing another stupid Texas song 

Toss your hats into the air, we're obnoxious, we don't care
Let's sing another stupid Texas song

One more blusterin', bumptious, bald faced, brazen
High flown, high-tone, dander-up, panderin'
Pompous, puffed-up, snotty, swaggerin'
Stupid Texas song

Austin Mahone,"You walk into the room
So perfect but unaware
Making me stop and stare
Every time I heard he broke your heart
Can I just fix you girl?
Show you a different world?

I'll put you on a throne
I'll lay down my heart, I swear
And I'll make sure that you'll never be alone

How I feel about you
Only my shadow goes
Where I dream of you and me
Should I go or wait?
Is it too soon, too late?
Only my shadow knows

I've been loving you so long
And now that I got the chance
I see you need to dance on your own
So I'll wait another day
Maybe another year

Girl, I woke up with you on my mind,
I found your picture on my phone,
I don't know what you did to me that night,
I'm in the twilight zone

Tell me why I'm trippin'
Still thinking 'bout the way you move?
Tell me am I crazy?
Will I ever ever find you?

Every minute I'm without you I lose,
'Cause an angel touched my heart and took my cool,
Every second burns like fire,
I'm doomed,
What I go through
'Til I find you

Gone, no trace I'm going Sherlock Holmes,
Cinderella when the clocks go strike,
It gets so hard to breathe on my own,

Lately, I've been thinkin' 'bout you my baby
I've been thinkin' bout sexin' you crazy
I've been thinkin' 'bout doin' the things you shouldn't do

On the dancefloor, over the bar
Or next time in L.A., pull over, get off, and you feel me right next to my Hollywood star
Play with it

Lady, hear me tonight
'Cause my feeling, is just so right
As we dance, by the moonlight
Can't you see, you're my delight?
Lady, I just feel like
I won't get you, out of my mind
I feel love, for the first time
And I know that it's true, I can tell by the look in your eyes

Austin Roberts,"Alone until my eighteenth year
We met four springs ago
She was shy and had a fear 
Of things she did not know
But we got it on together
In such a super way
We held each other close at night
And traded dreams each day

And she said,
""Rocky, I've never been in love before
Don't know if I can do it
But if you let me lean on you
Take my hand, I might get through it"" (through it)
I said, ""Baby, oh sweet baby
It's love that sets us free
And God knows if the world should end
Your love is safe with me""

We found an old gray house
And you would not believe the way
We worked at night to fix it up
Took classes in the day
Paintin' walls and sippin' wine
Sleepin' on the floor
With so much love for just two
Soon we found there'd be one more

And she said,
""Rocky, I've never had a baby before
Don't know if I can do it
But if you let me lean on you
Take my hand, I might get through it"" (through it)
I said, ""Baby, oh sweet baby
It's love that sets us free
And God knows if the world should end
Your love is safe with me""

We had lots of problems then but
We had lots of fun
Like the crazy party
When our baby girl turned one
I was proud and satisfied
Life had so much to give
'Till the day they told me
That she didn't have long to live

She said,
""Rocky, I've never had to die before
Don't know if I can do it...""

Now it's back to two again
The little girl and I
Who looks so much like her sweet mother
Sometimes it makes me cry
I sleep alone at nights again
I walk alone each day
And sometimes when I'm about to give in
I hear her sweet voice say, to me

""Rocky, you know you've been alone before
You know that you can do it
But if you'd like to lean on me
Take my hand, I'll help you through it""  (through it)
I said, ""Baby, oh sweet baby
It's love that sets us free
And I told you when the world would end
Your love was safe with me""

She said,
""Rocky, you know you've been alone before
You know that you can do it
But if you'd like to lean on me...",Rocky,1976
Austin Webb,"Early morning by the riverside
Saw an old man waiting for a bite
We started talking and he took me back in time
He said I was young and thought I'd always be
Then I woke up now I'm 83
There's so much I missed
Oh how I wish I could get back all that time I wasted

I see the tears of a young bride
The morning that we had our first fight
I should've held her tight
And on the day that my momma died
I hung up the phone and never said goodbye
Don't let it slip on
Don't let it slip on
Don't let it slip on by

Well he looked up with tears in his eyes
Said I'm not sure if you were looking for advice
There's just something about you
That reminds me of me
It ain't easy always looking back
But it seems these days that it's all I have
And what hurts me the most is knowing what could have been
And if I listen real close sometimes I can

Hear the sound of my little boy saying
Daddy can you come play with me?
But I was too busy
Then one day my baby grew up and went to war
I never thought he'd be gone in the blink of an eye
Don't let it slip on
Don't let it slip on
Don't let it slip on by

I shook the old man's hand and I thanked him
And I drove home as fast as I could go
Just to let her know
That I need her
That I love her
That I'm never gonna let another moment like this slip on by
Don't let it slip on by

We're only here for a little while
And God gives us only so much precious time
Don't let it slip on
Don't let it slip on
Don't let it slip on by
Don't let it slip on by",Slip On By,

Australian Crawl,"I said, hey, do you remember
Where we used to sit?
All them summer rubber-necks kept coming
To panel-van street
We just yacht club dancing, city girls were rich
I'm going to sneak out my window at four in the morning
Going to meet them on the beach

Lakeside, lakeside, lakeside
Steal away, hide away
Lakeside, lakeside, lakeside
I just can't wait, I just can't wait

I got a terrific Torana
A green hand going to wave bye-bye
I got a C.B. shuffle and a dashboard muffle
Pilot's twitch my eye
I've seen them from the mallway, supermarket spy
From the frozen goods section, the delicatessen
I've seen them racing by

They're going to wallow in the shallows
Great puce hippo
Bar-be-que and blubber
Please don't show, please don't show
They're going to steal my sand space
Out where the comperes go
You shoulda seen 'em bathers!
No hero, no hero
I said, hey, do you remember
Going cruising for a nude?
Spot-pickin'em, sand kicken'em
All the lousy and the lewd

She was such a pretty thing, and man what a host
Come evenin time she sets the table for rour
Some friends are commin round tonight
He's out on the town, He's tryin to score
Woke up early this morning something's on his mind
Cursin the night before, breakfast at nine
She felt him restless oh all through the night
She senses somethings wrong with him
She doesn't want to pry, she just wants to know why

Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh---Oh No, Not You Again

Don't own no smimming pool, not even a colour TV
He work awful hard some days and she lets him be
Things ain't looking to good for them no love no more

Standing at the barline with my lip on the curl
I'm with the other lean and lear
My finger on the pulse
And my hand around a beer

Ah, Ahh, well I don't wanna know what's going round here
Ah, Ahh, it's just a matter of time, hold it under light
Ah, Ahh, I've got to get away, to get away, to get away

The singer in the band, he sweat on a pose
And he's really such a jerk
Thinks he can call me stupid
Because he gets a lot of work
I'm standing in the background, got my arms on the fold
And every dog's gonna have it's day
The New Musical Express and my own 4-way P.A.

Well, I've been reading those biographies in paperback
I've got a death-wish that I can't explain
I've been working on the petulance

Like a nightingale without a song to sing

When it isn't even spring?

Walking down a strange new street
Hearing words that I have never heard
From a girl I've yet to meet

I'm as busy as a spider spinning daydreams
I'm as giddy as a baby on a swing

A knock at the door whether by day or night, as a prelude to a search without authority of law but solely on the authority of police, is inconsistent with the conception of human rights, enshrined in the history of basic constitutional documents of English speaking peoples.

Freedom of speech and freedom of press; the right to speak his mind is close to the heart of every American, the constitution prohibits most forms of censorship over the press and speechmakers. The argument against censorship is clear: no government official should be permitted to dictate what ideas or beliefs we are entitled to hear or believe. Both good and evil should be averted by more speech and not enforced silence.
Similarly while a person is free to make speeches on public streets he may be prevented from doing so when he uses a loud or raucous amplifier, which disturbs the public tranquility.

Until it's slowly worn down to nothing
Every stride
Wears the soul more thin
Until it's slowly worn down to nothing
And what can I do now

Every hour gave that mames
But our hearts don't work the same
By products of an evolution
Lost always looking for a lost solution
Now

Every stride
Wears the soul more thin
Until it's slowly worn down to nothing
Every stride
Wears the soul more thin
Until it's slowly worn down to nothing
Every stride
Wears the soul more thin
Until it's slowly worn down to nothing
Every stride
Wears the soul more thin
Until it's slowly worn down to nothing
No",Byron Black,2004
Autopilot Off,"Across these highways
And dead end roads
You wandered down
For somewhere new

And you travel lightly
Just the air inside was all you take
To carry on your way
Hoping it lasts until the end

Cause after all
Those frames filled the wall
Then your ripped them down
After all
They're leaves in the fall scattered on the ground

You ended up
Back where you began
And you couldn't find a face you knew

And you were hoping
You could always go back to that place
You wanted it to wait
Somewhere we will never see again

Cause after all
Those frames filled the wall
Then your ripped them down
After all
They're leaves in the fall scattered on the ground

Chromatic fades
Not when you're holding on
Drink until the glass is gone

Cause after all
Those frames filled the wall
Then your ripped them down
After all
They're leaves in the fall scattered on the ground",Chromatic Fades,2004
