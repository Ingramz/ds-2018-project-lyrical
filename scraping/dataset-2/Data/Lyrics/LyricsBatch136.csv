Desert Eagle Discs,"[Intro: Desert Eagle]
(Tell me... tell me...)
What would you do? Hillside Scramblers
Loose links, what would you?
Uh, check it, yo, yo, yo

[Desert Eagle]
I'm down for the get down, down wanna spit rounds
He started the beef, now, wanna split town
With the mark of the beast, thinkin' you the shit now
Four pound whippin' the flesh, better sit it down
Get it clown? You done started something
I put it down, and you just started hustlin'
Gettin' thirty off of a bundle, you project nothing
You'll get linked in a rumble, you project frontin'
Catch beef in the J's, it's project dumping
Test your heat when it blaze, better target something
Even my dick iced out, I be hard at fucking
Niggaz need to stop biting and try to market something
Niggaz need to start writing, your bark ain't nothing
Your tracks ain't hot, and your back don't function
Got the rap game locked, the crack game dumping
Got the crime scene hot, the club scene thumping, what?

[Chorus: Letha Face]
Tell me: what would you do?
If you was in my shoes and the nigga had the drop
Would you shoot first? Or get shot?
Or lift the earth from under his feet and make his boots rock
Tell me..

[Letha Face]
I can't stand it, people try to judge me
Especially the ones that said they love me, try to take me for granted
I been stranded with a mental block, sippin' expensive shots is hot
I could kiss the man who invented the glock
The thermometer pops burger, I stay on cock
So whenever my dogs call me, I'll be there, the end of story
Surrenders gory, close the book after the final chapter
Gradual bullets that travel faster than yacht masters
Hot ratchets that'll spin you, like a spinning top backwards
Cut your cabbage and turn it into coleslaw
I'm so raw, that my mom should of middle named me Diesel
These lethal bars perfected, can't be injected by needles
Breeding eagles out of Park Hill's hell hole
Where souls get sucked up, and shots turn your bones to Jell-o
Mellow tones with a stealth blow, under the bell's a four-four
The impact will crack an elephant's skull

[Chorus x2]

[INF-Black]
I'm like the hallways you walk through, smokin' a blunt with a brew
The staircase you piss on, gettin' head on the roof
Ride down my elevator, you get punched in the tooth
My alligators hang loose from the front to the phone booth
I'm the concrete, the gates, the bars, gunnin' my goof
I'm the drugs, the money, the booze, and every rules
Fuckin' Betty who? Niggaz is petty, can get it to
Watch your mouth nigga, watch me, watch you
Like a movie, thought it was cool, how you wanted to do me
See me live with the snakes and get rid of them rats
I'm the fire in the lake, I burn faster than a match
But longer in a forest, at the speed of a mach
Spittin' out, bangin' off ground, I'm tearin' it down
There's never no fear in me, and they tellin' what's in me now
I've done tasted the dust, washed my face with the mud
Off with these clowns, my shoes is only made from my blood

[Chorus]

You seem to think that I just can't see
I was hoping he was out of your heart

Now he's back and I'm blue

I forgot about yesterday
Those memories seemed so far away
All it took was just a whisper to start
The flame burning anew
Now he's back and I'm blue

Ooh, that old feeling
Filling up your dreams again
Oh, it comes stealing
Taking you away

I guess there's nothing left for me to do
I can't stop him from living in you
'Cause the past can only pull us apart
Still you carry it through

Desert Rose Band,"I put our little baby to bed last night
She was sleeping real good while
I tucked her in tight
I looked at her once

Then I looked at her twice
Her little legs are longer
And I'm running out of time
The boys are gonna chase her

I'll be standing in line our baby's gone
Up at 7:30 she comes into our room
She wants to make her breakfast
But she can't find her spoon

We wake up and try to shake the sandman
Out of our eyes
She's already got her clothes on much to our surprise   
She did it all by herself and we realize our baby's gone

Three years old and she's the queen of the world
Humpty Dumpty's falling down
Little Jack Horner's on the boredom border
Oh mamma what do we do now

Playing outside her little face to the wind
The hours go by her strength is wearing thin
She doesn't call for daddy she's a big girl now
Her mamma looks in wonder and she don't know how

How our baby girl escaped us no more cuddling now
Our baby's gone
Three years old and she's the queen of the world

Desert Rose Band,"Do I have to change my name 
Move to another town start all over again 
Nothing seems to feel the same whenever you're around 
You treat me like an old friend 
Do I have to fake love do I have to make love 
From the punishments and promises you hand to me 
What is this attitude if this is really you 
Then you're not all that you make yourself out to be 
I see that you've been courting fame under another name 
Tell me where does it end
Just who's the one you're looking for behind that unknown door 
Should I start over again 
Do I have to fake love do I have to make love 
From the punishments and promises you hand to me 
What is this attitude if this is really you 
Then you're not all that you make yourself out to be 
But I've got a brand new life  I've got  the song of love
And if only you could share all that I'm dreaming of

Desert Rose Band,"Woke up this mornin', happy as could  be
I looked out my window, what's that I  see
Coming' up the sidewalk, just as plain as day
Well here comes trouble that I never thought 
I'd see since you went away.

Hello  trouble come on in
Well you talk about heartaches 
Where in the world you been
Well, I ain't had the miseries 
Since you been gone
Well  hello trouble, trouble, trouble
Welcome home.

We'll make a pot of coffee 
And you can rest your shoes
And you can tell me them sweet lies 
And I'll listen to you
Well it's just a little part of, 
Part of the life we'd live
But I'd rather have a little bit of trouble 
Than to never know the love you give.

Hello  trouble, come on in

Desert Rose Band,"I know that sometimes I'm difficult
Sometimes I'm crazy
I'm like a storm that keeps blowing your way
And I know it's not fair
I can't think of a reason to hurt you this way

Words I don't mean cause you sadness
Things that I've done to encourage this madness
Made a fool of myself
Love's not supposed to happen this way

Shades of blue covering you
And turning your sunshine to rain
I keep depending on you
To carry me through
And color my shades of blue

How many times will you forgive me
How many storms still lie within me
Say you'll always be there
To pick up the pieces of this broken man

When it's all over the air is so still
I'm left all by myself and this chill that I feel
When I look in your eyes
Love's not supposed to happen this way

She don't love nobody
Nothin' borrowed, nothin' blue

Behind the green eyes I detect
She don't love nobody

She don't love nobody

All of her life
She's been told to hang on tight
There's a man who'd make her his wife
But she's not interested in anything mama said

She throws passion to the wind
She don't love nobody
She don't give out but she don't give in
She don't love nobody

And if I could I'd make her mine
But she don't love nobody
And she would never walk that line

Desert Rose Band,"You held me up, held me down
Made me crazy, then you brought me around
Were my darkness and my light
You were my blindness and my sight

Were my shelter and my storm
Made me cold then you made me warm
You were my fever and my cure
Made me doubt then you made me sure

One step forward and two steps back
Nobody gets too far like that
One step forward and two steps back
This kind of dance can never last

You were my hope and my fears
You were my laughter and my tears
Were my destiny and my fate
Kept me movin', you made me wait

Were my weakness and my power
You were the thorn and the flower
You were my sunshine and the rain
Made me feel so good, brought so much pain

Now one step forward and two steps back
Nobody gets too far like that
One step forward and two steps back
This kind of dance can never last

And we were never really meant for each other
We were never really meant to last
In the years that we danced together
Each step forward we took two steps back
Each step forward we took two steps back

Now one step forward and two steps back
Nobody gets too far like that

She hunts for work and food
Their clothes are torn and tattered, 
So her kids stay out of school

Just leave a message. We'll call you back""

Sheets and blankets on these paper pages

Cause I have money, they think that
I'm a fool to them when I do but I know it's right

Call me eccentric man

I could have the comfort of my country home
But until that time

And a brown rat for a watch dog

You are my only heart

To the frozen north
Skating, falling
Falling down, down, down
Into icy water

I'll be what you want me to be
To bring you to your knees
Your lover, your daughter
We'll move in slow motion
Falling down, down, down
Into icy water
You took a girl like me

I might never leave this room again
Shut myself inside the old photographs
The faded light of the young girl
Patterns, shadows on the walls
Painted ladies
They look a lot like me

A plan that disappears in smoke

Heel and you hoe and you've fallen behind
A handful of knowledge that weakens your mind
A heart full of truth and it's making you blind
Ohhh, holey dime

Sent to hell on paper wings
They're all laughing
A drone that permeates all things
Now you're tone deaf
A stitch in time and it's your tongue
Chew on rubber
The nectar falls into your mouth
And turns to gravel

Blades on Escalades, electric shocks on Range Rovers

You see us flossing on chrome, with the styrofoam cup
I got a eight and a liter, swanging on the feeter
In the Bentley watching BET, I'm tripping off of Cita
Cristal margaritas, we some block bleeders
My balling tire size, can't ride in two-seaters
Man I need Excursion, or my Navigator

My drop top is a supreme, king of a young team's dream
Like a diamond it bling-bling, when it's hit with sun beams
Shoot more spiders in my ring, when I glide up the block
I got a trunk full of knock, about to bust air shocks
I'm shutting down the parking lot, when you see me ride
See me sitting high with pride, sliding on the buck hide
Looking pretty, on a tour all across my city
Sipping drank by the pint, about to bust my kidney
From the North to the South, we gon represent

It brings back the sound of music so tender
It brings back a night of tropical splendor
It brings back a memory ever green

I'm with you once more under the stars
And down by the shore an orchestra's playing
And even the palms seem to be swaying
When they begin the beguine

To live it again is past all endeavor
Except when that tune clutches my heart
And there we are, swearing to love forever
And promising never, never to part

What moments divine, what rapture serene
Till clouds came along to disperse the joys we had tasted
And now when I hear people curse the chance that was wasted
I know but too well what they mean

So don't let them begin the beguine
Let the love that was once a fire remain an ember
Let it sleep like the dead desire I only remember
When they begin the beguine

Oh yes, let them begin the beguine, please make them play
Till the stars that were there before return above you
Till you whisper to me once more, ""Darling, I love you""

We're swept apart too soon.

Speak low, darling speak low,
Love is a spark lost in the dark,
Too soon, too soon,
I feel wherever I go
That tomorrow is near, tomorrow is here
And always too soon.

Time is so old and love so brief,
Love is pure gold and time a thief.
We're late darling, we're late,

It's very nice, so full of spice
And when they're dancin they bring a happy ring the maraquero
Singin a song, all the day long

So if you like the beat
Take a lesson from cuban pete,
And I'll teach you to chick chicky boom, chick chicky boom

Si, senorita, I know that you will like the chicky boom chick
'Cause it's the dance of latin romance
And Cuban Pete doesn't teach you in a hurry like Authur Murry

No ordinary shit
No ordinary bitches
No ordinary whips

I came along way from food stamps in section 8

Get yourself a plate
And I'm a step away
One hit, one breath away
When on God time, you ain't never late
Come so victory is here
We can celebrate

OK, I'm on my grizzle
On my grind
Go ahead try, top my shine
I'm on my way, anyday

Have me laughin' all the way to the bank

Just so they can see me baby

Run up on a nigga if you want to
You gotta vest i gotta a shell that'll go through

Good dope in the drop like soul food
Big Body, big rims on the old school
Stay fly like a hood nigga 'posed too
Lights off click clack in the pinto
Seat back, dick sucked in the Benzo
5 percent D-B's on the Renzo
No sleep, gotta eat, gotta get done

It's like I always say
Motherfucka' here I come
Another victory for the crib
A couple more before I'm done
And if you asleep you better wake up
And get on your fuckin' job
Cause I'm takin' everything except a loss
Iceburg goes off, yeah 24-7 I goes on
And I be scared I might miss money
So I don't doze off
I'm a snap and the streets know it
Trick told me keep goin'

When your heart's gone blind?

It feels so real
You can't help yourself (you can't help yourself!)
If your not made of steel
You've gotta sit yourself down
And tell yourself

When you find someone
When you're deep inside
Not to come undone
When temptation tastes
Too dangerous
It takes discipline
When you make love

Born out of passion
It's hard to hold on
It's easier to drown in an ocean
Of emotion
So wind you up and
Get down to your soul
When every night a stranger comes knocking
But you're sleeping alone

You don't want to bleed
'Cause you've been hurt before (You've been hurt before! )
Surrender to your needs
But, Love, protect yourself
'Cause love is war

It might feel like heaven but it might be hell

When you find someone
When you're deep inside
Not to come undone
When temptation tastes
Too dangerous
It takes discipline
When you make love

When you find someone
That you want so bad
That it drives you mad
When a kiss just isn't
Hot enough

A cast out a Hollywood
And the popcorn from the candy stand
Makes it all seem twice as good
There's alway lots of pretty girls
With figures they don't try to hide
But they never can compare
To the girl sittin' by my side

Too much was left unsaid

Don't leave me this way

Lost without you, nothing else matters
Can you see through, all that I do
I'm calling for you now and forevermore

Or were the times we had unreal but not the tears they bring
The memories they sting

Girl, I want you to see I need you with me
Oh, please let us be
I've so much to give, please let our love live
Oh, can't you forgive

Blowing all on it like it's hot coffee

And the Freon burns a hole in the sky.
You can find my kind living right on the fault line,
Eyes on the seaside, lives on the B-side,
Kites on the power-lines.

I know what he tells you,
But I don't know why you believe it or leave it alone.
It's just us walking home and dodging cars.
The rest of the believers follow brighter burning stars.

A pushpin through my sternum,
I spent a long year under glass,
Watching your reflection in the cases as you passed.
And cupid limps in two years too late with a love letter for the ugly sister.

I'm sorry but you missed her, Mr. Mystery to me,
How lost you seem to be.
From beneath, it all looks the same,
Gum-covered and rusted from the rain.

And the Freon burns a hole in the sky.
You can find my kind living right on the fault line,
Eyes on the seaside, lives on the B-side,

Maybe you were right all along.
I say I'm sorry less than I am wrong.
So here we are, both half-starved.

I'm going down, down, down, down

Setting up just to knock, knock, knock me

Going down, down, down, down

Pull you close but when we kiss,
When we kiss I can feel the doubt
I remember back when we started
My kisses used to turn you inside out

I used to drive you to work in the mornings

Congratulations
You have invented a new kind of stupid
A 'damage you can never undo' kind of stupid
An 'open all the cages in the zoo' kind of stupid
'Truly, you didn't think this through?' kind of stupid

Let's review
You took a rumor a few maybe two people knew and refuted it 
By sharing an affair of which no one has accused you
I begged you to take a break, you refused to
So scared of what your enemies might do to you
You're the only enemy you ever seem to lose to
You know why Jefferson can do what he wants?
He doesn't dignify schoolyard taunts with a response!

So yeah, congratulations!
You've redefined your legacy
Congratulations

I languished in a loveless marriage in London
I lived only to read your letters
I look at you and think 'God, what have we done with our lives and what did it get us?'
That doesn't wipe the tears or the years away
But I'm back in the city and I'm here to stay
And you know what I'm here to do?
I'm not here for you

I know my sister like I know my own mind
You will never find anyone as trusting or as kind
And a million years ago, she said to me 'this one's mine'
So I stood by
Do you know why?

I love my sister more than anything in this life
I will choose her happiness over mine every time
Eliza
Is the best thing in our life
So never lose sight of the fact that you have been blessed with the best wife

Congratulations
For the rest of your life
Every sacrifice you make is for my sister
Give her the best life

The bright light I was starin' at turn lime
And the green stuff turned to slime, and grime
Everybody want to be your blood cousin
When you're buzzing
Fine, I give 'em my other line, another rhyme
Word to mother, I'm goosed up
My two fucks in two cups
Another double entendre
She fell in that Bombay
Now she tumble dry lingerie
Chardonnay nothing but the bottle of emotion
But the love potion when it sprays
They just caught up in the days
Let me show you how I feel these Jays
The cheese stays high like Dr. J
My flow is like land the boats, dock the planes
Hand the dope but cop the chains
For more fiends some antidote to stop the pain
Now my stream, floods these streets

I keep niggas on their toes
So you got creases in your Forces

I am not of this Earth bro
I'm a satellite that's bound to fight
But we're down to light, 'n light the fuck up

Two dubs I got 40 on my hit list
Just smoking drinks both the broken in-glass like old English

Is your eyes dilated from the kush 'n Nuvo?
This new for the life
Like a Nubian with the doobie cold eyes
Better smell the coffee I'mma coughing
That means I'm sick widdit, spit it out
Kill it like airborne diseases
Is this why the rap game is this easy?
Like please eat your vegetables
So I took a dose of the edible
Ain't an overdose
Already a rap monster fucking overload
Hopping up on stepping stones
So we making stepping stones
Turn up that tichrome
Be back to introduce
This is Messiah and the eyes are hopeless
Please open my divide eyes through the world flex

Saw nothing but shots since the project days
Like I was eyin' the Tec
Kept the eye in the text
Make 'em see my eye in the Lex
Giving my blood sweat and iron injecting selecting the soul
Cause mind body and soul can't be reinstalled
Special with the flow to make Niagara fall
It's over for the systematic rapping robotics
Crashing my logic
These niggas hooked on hooks and Hooked on Phonics
With hooked on phonics the pot could get em hooked on chronic
Cause pain conditions from the page conditions
Racing like Sonic inhaling the tonic
They couldn't grade my brain in a college
Themes behind it rob you for ya mind like thieves is behind it
So we had to squeeze in knowledge
To pile it when the green sees wallet
Anything to let the green seize wallet
Taking forever and a century with sentence speeds
Like a penitentiary to build cell blocks to block your memory
Catch me on the enemy's territory

Destiny Praise,"Are you in bondage to the status of nice things 
Addicted to the attention and the compliments they bring 
Feeling the weight of growing debt with each bill 
That's not His Will 
That's not His Will 

If that's not you then maybe this one's on point 
Still need a drink or you gotta smoke one joint 
To get thru the pain of all the heartache that you feel 
That's not His Will 
That's not His Will 

It's not a trial, It's not a test 
God wants for you, His Best 
But not until you submit to His Will 

Do you need validation wrapped up in false love 
So you sneak out, to the strip club 
Knowing that nothing there can ever be for real 
That's not His Will 
That's not His Will 

Maybe you think that you will find it in someone 
So you sleep around hoping each time that you're done 
But that one is not found and you're still trying to heal 
That's not His Will 
That's not His Will 

It's seems unfair,It's so much stress 
God wants for you, His Best 
But not until you submit to His Will 

He heard your crying tears 
He knows your silent fears 
He wants to just renew 
His relationship with you 

Don't be afraid of facing everything inside 
Even the guilt, wrapped up in pride 
God will step but He's waiting until 
You're in His Will 
You're in His Will 

Don't you give up, don't settle for less 
God wants for you His Best 
But not until you submit to His Will 

Jesus is waiting 

To reveal His plan for you for real 

But it won't happen 

Til you stop and submit to His will

See it ain't no limit, it's only the beginnin'.
Why? 'Cuz all y'all want us to fall, and hit the wall.
It'll only take a minute, an' see I gets the bomb tree.
Beats by the Pound shit, it sound sick, rolex, and baguettes all.
I take this out the ghetto an' live up on top.
Akin flights, an shoppin' sprees, on 5-0-4 yachts.
See, money don't change me, make me live a lil' bit good.
Took some of my family members, an' my homies out the hood.
See, we ghetto millionaires, far away when we meet.
I think they watched us, P, 'cuz about when we speak.
See I'm too deep to change, everybody know my name.
I guess I gotta charge it to da game.

Now they violent, gotta get it rowdy.
Peep game gotta Benz, Lex Luger in or out it.
Don't hate me, the money don't make me.
It's gonna take two hundred million just to break me,
'Cuz I'm a soldier, I thought I told ya.
I like that doja, but hate the rollers.
Crystal, greed, an hinace, got cream. 
Makes a brother in a Bentley, from the ghetto.
There ain't no limit 'cuz we livin' large.
Bought a rolex, a yacht, with a gold card.
You done lately, your girl wanna date me, in my grill.
For, Ugh, an' I'm straight g.

[Chorus]

I guess they call me a hustler, 'cuz of the fast livin'.
But if I see somethin' I gotta get it, because I have vision.
An' if I like it, I gotta get, if I saw it.
Went from, over the shows, over the doors,
House full of floors that's marble, a brand new Ferrari.
Parked it, when I bought it, see, I'm a no limit soldier.
An' I came to get it started, what you, what you think?
I'm all about my bank, tryin' to be a multi-millionaire.
Before I'm old enough to drink, now we can ride, bro.  No lie, bro.
See, nobody be here beside us, so go ahead an fire it up.
Some girls wanna perk it, my homies like to work it.
Soldiers from Texas, all the way to Jersey.
Tick to the tock, all around the clock.
From the north, to the south, 
To the east, to the west, it just don't stop.
So to all my real g's, throw them up high,
To all the ballers that have the corks of Crystal, let it fly.
That's how we live.

[Chorus]

No Limit, say what? I'm what?  Say what? 
New Orleans, say what? I'm what?  Say what? 
South side, say what? Ugh! I'm what?  Say what?
East side, say what? I'm what?  Say what?
West coast, say what? I'm what?  Say what?
North side, say what? I'm what?  Say what?
Silkk The Shocker, say what? I'm what?  Say what?
No Limitc say what? I'm what?  Say what?
Ha ha, playas, congratulate. 
Ain't no hatin' on this side.  Where the money at? 
That's what hustlin' is about, you heard me? 
Master P, Silkk The Shocker, hustlin' till the izend.

Why yo face lookin' all sad and blue 
Don't you like the Navigator truck that I brought you 
Why you trying to act a fool 
Don't try to say you seen me talking to your girlfriends 
Ask Tonya and Shirl then 
Gimme a place and time when 
Don't try to accuse me of silly stuff that I'm doing on the streets 
You gotta remember, without you, there's no me 
I'm just an average man 
Tryin' to make it in this cold world 
Tell me baby, why you trippin', girl 

I don't want to fuss with you 
So I'm gonna sit out on the couch 
Don't try to talk to me 
'cause boy I am blocking you out 
I don't want to hear a thing

You should think twice 
About the way you've been talking to me

Get on the bus 
Ain't got no time (for) 
Talkin' all yo stuff 
Need to pack my stuff

There's no more 
Go catch a cab or 
Get on the bus 
I ain't got no time for 
You talkin' all that junk 
Better get my stuff 
Since this is what you want 
I don't really care 

I ain't got no words for you 
So you can stop callin' my friends 
Tellin' them it wasn't your fault 
And why I ain't lettin' you in

I let you back in my life

And this won't go down tonight

Mm, mm (who)

Introduce you to Dolce and Gervana 
Advance you from dirt bikes to Hondas 
Took you from that terrible stress 
Now you telling me that I am a bother 
What kind of mess is that 
To tell a man who put you on his team 
That's just like killing a dream 
(No no baby) That's how it seems 
I worked hard to build up what I had for you 
I pray to God, that there's not another man between me and you 
So just tell me 
There's no need to lie for 
While you sleepin' with your eyes closed 
Do you want to talk, aight yo

Is to discuss Destiny's Child's
Commandments of relationships

You know it's so unfortunate, so unnecessary
For us to end up with broken hearts

Yes Godfather
Times have changed
Relationships aren't like the old days
You know?

See what we need is a man of his word
All this, uh cheating, uh backstabbing, uhm hating
No more, no more

But Godfather, how do we avoid all these mishaps?

To the hood I introduced her
She feisty, every now and then she wanna fight me

Tie your hands to the bedpost when I caress you

Took you from being a nine to being a dime
You complain that we don't spend time
When I'm OT on the grind going hard for mine
Yo, when shorty say she hate me you know she mean she love me
When she play me close at the bar that mean she want some Bubbly
See my polying with another chick and shit get ugly
She wanna flip, threaten to run keys across my whip
Try to burn a nigga with some hominy grits
That's how she on it, when I met her she was lowkey
Now she wanna OD

I say what I'm feeling, niggas say that I'm illing

It's hard to say or tell
When there's love in the air
So I continue to be Miss Dawg of the year

And take care of my peeps when the streets is hot
You need a place to stay just pull out the cot
And I swerve in the two-door car without no shotgun
Driver took 'em lukewarm to hot like lava

I not one that's forgotten
There's a lot of haters that be hatin' for nothing
With their hand out waitin' for something
Chick like me I waits for nothin'

Put in work till the cake come in
So breathe easy whenever you need me
Just yell, V-I-T-A know it well

Chop it up like onions to add that flavor
I'm fresh even your mami wish I was her seed
I rip a hole in the track as it bleed

I breeve on 'em and make 'em feel the heat
Obviously it's evident I can't be beat, what?
I strut in dem thirty-eight jeans or the fitted ones
Either way you still want to split something

Could it be the curves in the waist? (What?)
Or could it be the Suburban I push when I swerve through the place
(Uh) Got the nerve to not be able to be replaced (Yeah)
Haters can't tap in cause I can't be traced (Uh)

This my house, don't speak until spoken to
Disrespect me and I'm choking you what?

Caramel complexion 
With the sexiest expression 
Curly hair and corn rolls 

Very nice physique ?? clothes 
He looked at me 
I looked at him 
He asked me what I was thinking 

Because he walked so beautiful 
I didn't know what to say to him 

He was what I wanted 
Exactly what I needed 
He was what I fantasized 
He was what I dreamed 
And it would be so perfect 
If him and me would leave 
Why couldn't I just tell him my feelings? 
We were meant to be 

[Chorus]
I spotted him walking in the doorway 
Of the restaurant of the other day 
When I met that perfect man 
I didn't speak when I had the chance 
I didn't know exactly what to say 
At the restaurant the other day 
When I met that perfect man 
I didn't speak when I had the chance 

Sexy lips, platinum wrists 
Ten tips like he gets manicures 
I can't resist those eyes of his 
Staring at his lips and then his ears 

And his voice is hypnotizing 
And his hand was tantalizing 
I dismissed what I wished 
Without me realizing 

He was what I wanted 
Exactly what I needed 
He was what I fantasized 
He was what I dreamed 

And it would be so perfect 
If him and me would leave 
Why couldn't I just tell him my feelings? 
We were meant to be

To run into your definition of that perfect man 
Don't be blinded by how fine the man is 
And miss the chance that might be your last 
Make him understand that he's your perfect man

Made a lotta money, made a lotta enemies
Would I do this shit all over again, I dunno
That's a good question, would you do your life over again?
I know I fuck fat ass Tasha one more time if I have nothing else to do
I fuck that bitch one more time, that ass was fat

Yo, Shorty get a desk and chair now wit the guess appear
But if you knew my life you'd shed a tear where from the
Fucked up scar to the tough luck bar to my cousin fightin'
Chapters in a crushed up car I handled live beef from the
Pluriel I beef capeshe a few cats tried to muirelize me
'Cause I drive a fresh Benz and collect ends but I lost brothers
Some best friends word life, we all bredgren but we all speak
And nobody budgin' 'cause we all stubbrin' yeah, we let the hate rise

Give each other fake fives look back peripheral give each other
Snake eyes, true in all sequels you too of all people, guess they
Right money is the root of all evil a nigga front on them though
I triggered at em', I don't know Big it's just the type of nigga I am
I live my life a thug live my life wit drugs fuck everybody else
I live my life for Blood, so Lexus, Moff and I got's to keep Triste near
'Cause Blood suppose to be here

All those times we sung, all those crimes we've done
All those times was fun but would you do it again?
All those times we sung, all those crimes we've done
All those times was fun but would you do it again?

One of my worst fears, is being stuffed in a hearse
Six feet deep being crushed my the earth
Bury me wit rings so when I'm plucked from the earth
Every motherfucker see how much it was worth
Oh you stressin' my best misjudgin' of my worst
And all my life put in nothin' but work
Y'all talk about how I was such a big flirt

And I never slowed down 'cause I was fuckin' with skirts
I mean since the early days I was cuttin' from church
Y'all talk about things I've done to my life
You talk about things that I've done to my wife
I know where I'm going so I can come in a crisis
I do this for my niggas, who never get no cheddar
For my niggas up state, that'll never get a letter

For my vitally sick, that would never get no better
For my niggas in the cold, that would never get a sweater
For the life I lead and things I done
A nigga went to school I had to bring my gun
A nigga had to hustle I had to slung them drums
As the man of the house I had to bring income

All those times we sung, all those crimes we've done
All those times was fun but would you do it again?
All those times we sung, all those crimes we've done
All those times was fun but would you do it again?

Yo, this life I should rock again?
Stand on this motherfuckin' block again?
Almost get shot again see alotta men get shot up bad
Back up hobbilin', sista out gossipin' so I don't rhyme
For executives, it's imparitive do it for my jail berg consecutive
Get my messages, hell no or my block nigga never live

One room 7 kid, screamin' mother overhead two plates
One fork sour milk and a loaf of bread but I shook it off
Smiled of course kid, my girl wild out on some child support
Shit I'm out exhausted obsolete y'all but girls will flip like
Dominique Daws I'm not here to teach y'all
Just here to reach y'all if I do my life over, I repeat all

All those times we sung, all those crimes we've done
All those times was fun but would you do it again?
All those times we sung, all those crimes we've done
All those times was fun but would you do it again?

Could it be that you
Are at the crib with another lady
If you took it there
First of all, let me say
I am not the one
To sit around, and be played
So prove yourself to me
I am the girl that you claim
Why don't you say the thangs
That you said to me yesterday

I know you say that I am assuming things
Something's going down that's the way it seems
Shouldn't be the reason why you're acting strange
If nobody's holding you back from me

Tell the truth,who you with
How would you like it if
I came over with my clique
Don't try to change it now
See you gotta bounce
When two seconds ago
You said you just got in the house
It's hard to believe that you
Are at home, by yourself
When I just heard the voice
Heard the voice of someone else
Just this question why
Do you feel you gotta lie
Gettin' caught up in your game
When you can not say my name

You wanna come back
Is that a fact
You got it like that
You made me wait too long
I'm gone

Now that she's gone
You wanna come back
Is that a fact
You got it like that
You made me wait too long
I'm gone

Take her to the movies
Dinner all the time
Shopping sprees for her
On me you never spent a dime
But I was there for you
When you had nothing at all
Then you got a little job
She's the one you call on, and now

Now that she's gone
You wanna come back

You got it like that
You made me wait too long

Oh no, you're taking me for granted
But you only get one chance
Then you left me hurting
And it won't happen again no, no
So she finally left you
It ain't no surprise
That you miss your water

Why I think you I want you back
After what you did to me
Did you think you blinded me
Boy you know, whatever you do
It will all come back to you
'Cause you're trying to play me like a fool
I just wanna say it again

Understand, I understand
Why I think you I want you back
After what you did to me
Did you think you blinded me
Boy you know, whatever you do
It will all come back to you
It will come back to you

Now that she's gone
Crawling back
Got it like that
You made me wait too long
I'm gone

Now that she's gone
Come back
You made me wait too long

Chorus: 
Do you ever wonder when he 
Don't come home who he goes to see 
And why in the middle of the night he leaves you alone 
Leaves you alone he's with me 
Do you ever wonder when he 
Don't come home who he goes to see 
And why in the middle of the night he leaves you alone 
Cause everything he likes is with me 
Verse One 
See If I was in your shoes 
I would have had to let him know 
From the first sign of him tryin' to play 
If he want me to stay 
He's gotta let all that go 
But no, you want to stick around 
and not believe in what you see 
And while you're waitin' 
Thinkin' everything's gonna be ok' 
I've got 'm, I've got 'm right here with me 
Repeat Chorus 
Verse Two 
I want to call you so bad 
And tell you where we started 
And what we do 
How long its been going on 
And why he ain't gonna never come home 
Cause I know what you didn't do 
To make him stay 
You see a bad performing 
Unfulfilling woman 
drives a man away 
Repeat Chorus 
Verse Three 
Now as far as I know 
He's in good hands 
So you can stop callin' all around 
Sayin' have you seen my man 
Ain't no need to fuss and fight 
Tryin' to make it right 
Certain things ain't meant to be 
And that's why,that's why he's right here with me

Destiny's Child,"This is how I feel, about Christmas
I'm doing one time too

It's the smell of pine, it's the Christmas lights
It's the feeling of God, it's that good ol' Egg Nog
It's the blessed faces, it's them happy babies

It's the family prayer, it's that new V.S. underwear
It's that anxiousness, it's that gratefulness
It's that broke shiz-nit after givin' all them gifts

Loving and laughing and sharing this winter paradise
Loving and laughing and sharing this winter paradise

What this Christmas means to me
Spending my time with my family
Knowing it's a season for giving
Running downstairs for mom's cooking

Send the Christmas love to the ones you know
Kissin' your man under the mistletoe
Spreading love to everyone
And thanking God for the birth of his Son

Loving and laughing and sharing this winter paradise
Loving and laughing and sharing this winter paradise

Snowing and it's cold outside
Wrapping gifts by the fireside
My family is here, Christmas day is here
It's that very special time of the year

Blessed time, a joyous time
It's a giving time, a feeling time
It's a happy time, a laughing time
Sharing this winter paradise

Loving and laughing and sharing this winter paradise
Loving and laughing and sharing this winter paradise

It's your gifts you give, it's your relatives
It's your kids in the back room, it's that good home cooked food
It's the Christmas color, it's the stocking stuffer
It's the impatient nights, winter paradise

Loving and laughing and sharing this winter paradise
Loving and laughing and sharing this winter paradise

Till he appear'd and the soul felt its worth
A thrill of hope the weary soul rejoices
For yonder breaks a new and glorious morn!

Oh night divine

You thought that I'd be broke without ya, but I'm richer

You thought I wouldn't grow without ya, now I'm wiser!

Uh
Now I dun' been through the storm and the rain
Climbed up the rough side and got tough at times
But I remain, if I got the stuff to shine
And pull out the pump, protect mine
Survive in the game, hate on me 'cause you lame
They don't ever see your face or say your name
No more pain for me, no more misery, 'cause you history
I'm a hold on to what I got
Strap on to my perfection, strap on protection
My own direction, born to be the best at what I do
I'ma make it through, stompin' like a soldier in my big black boots
I keep 'em ""Jumpin', Jumpin',"" stayin' funky, funky for you
No matter who's that man that walk out of your life
You don't need 'em, don't be no heater
Long as I'm still breathin', not leavin' for no reason
Seen them come and go, one switch, they not gold
No house no mo', not even a condo
As long as I know how to love, I'm a stay alive
No need your game or style
They can't tame me 'cause I'm wild, not ashamed of stayin' down
Can the rain sit, and 'em things chromed out, spit
And in my game, no doubt, I'm a get paid in a big way, survivor!

Starin' at me, had my nostrils open wide
Can't even vocalize what I visualize and my body paralyzed

I know that he loves me 'cause it's obvious
I know that he loves me 'cause it's me he trusts
And he's missin' me if he's not kissin' me

Looked at it through a child's eyes, and I saw these beautiful

You been right here through thick and thin
You are my best friend
Gotten me through places I have been
You are my best friend
Through our situations
You have been my inspiration
My best friend
Your still here and I love you

I think you got angel wings
Hiding up under there somewhere
Michelle, my belle
Dunno where we would be
If we never met you girl
I love you, I thank you
You such a blessing
I am so grateful
I truly believe the Lord
Sent you to me and Kelly
The smile the laughter
Always makes me happy
When I am too serious
Or too intense
With a voice that beautiful
You was heaven sent

My sister my life couldn't be better
Doing what I love with my best friend
And making Cheddar Kelly
The most beautifulest girl in the world
You are my survivor and I admire you
You have no idea how special you are
Humble, talented and blessed you are
Sometimes I wish I could be more like you
Sometimes they don't wanna give your credit to you
Wouldn't be a Destiny's Child if it wasn't for you
DC 3 forever I'm thanking you

Lord thank you for your vision
That we see down here on earth
Thank you for your precious gifts
Your sweet precious gift of love
Through everything can no one come between
Us three

Michelle, ah
Ain't it funny
God always know what he is doing
And he showed me some of that when you came
Into me and be in his life
And just let us know that we can count on you
And actually stay with a relaxed heart
Together we are sisters
Your smile has so much meaning so much life
You are the perfect fit
What more could we ask for
We got Michelle
Your voice is like water
Your voice is like rain
And the world ain't ready for you
I love you and I will always be here for you

Beyonce, we have come so far together
And it feels so good to have traveled
Half the road of life with an angel
Walking and learning and teaching you the whole time
God is so awesome
And I thank him for answering my prayers as a child
I never told you this, but I prayed for
A lifelong friend as a child
And God just has his way of sending precious treasures
And I found mine
Everyday our relationship gets stronger
And I love you for the loyal, unselfish
Generous, gifted, wise and beautiful
Person you are
No one absolutely no one can take that away from us
You are the definition of a true friend

B and Kelly you two mean so much to me
Only God knew that this union was meant to be
Only God knew all the things we couldn't see
But if we pray together
We'll stay together

Beyoncé and Kelly
You both exemplify coming from my eyes
What love is
Love is patient Beyoncé that's what you've been
Love is kind Miss Kelly, that's what you have shown
It does not envy, it does not boast, it is not proud
It is not rude It is not self seeking
It is not easily angered, it keeps no record of wrong
Love does not delight in evil but rejoices with the truth
It always protects, always trusts, always hopes
Always perseveres

Don't cry, you're beautiful
It's not your fault, young girl
Don't cry, you're beautiful
You're not the one to blame
Soon it will be okay
One day you'll realize
Your beauty

It was a Saturday
This cold afternoon
Inside this house there lived
A frightened young girl
She didn't know what she should do
'Cause she missed her mother so
She was left home all alone
With her step father

Please dry your eyes, young girl
Don't cry, you're beautiful
It's not your fault, young girl
Don't cry, you're beautiful
You're not the one to blame
Soon it will be okay
One day you'll realize
Your beauty

He touched her places
That he shouldn't have touched
He did some things to her
That he shouldn't have done
So she ran into her room
Paged her mother 9 1 1
And the tragedy began
For this young girl

She told her mother
Her family, and friends
No one believed her
'Cause before this happened
She was filled with hate and anger
Towards her step father
'Cause he took her mother
From her when they married

Please dry your eyes, young girl
Don't cry, you're beautiful
It's not your fault, young girl
Don't cry, you're beautiful
You're not the one to blame
Soon it will be okay
One day you'll realize
Your beauty

She looked for her father
In the men that she saw
Thought that all she had to offer
Was her body
No one to figure out why
This young girl would live her life
In such pain and unhappiness
'Cause she was so beautiful

She rebelled and one day
The young girl fell in love
With another man like her stepdad
He abused her emotionally
And made her feel like she was worthless
Hope one day she realize
And see the beauty in her eyes
All she needs is prayer and strength
She's beautiful

Please dry your eyes, young girl
Don't cry, you're beautiful
It's not your fault, young girl
Don't cry, you're beautiful
You're not the one to blame
Soon it will be okay
One day you'll realize
Your beauty

Please dry your eyes, young girl
Don't cry, you're beautiful
It's not your fault, young girl
Don't cry, you're beautiful

Soon it will be okay

Stressing me, paging my beeper
You're just non-stop

That you be leaving me messages every 10 minutes
And then you stop by
When I first met you, you were cool
But it was game you had me fooled
'Cause 20 minutes after I gave you my number
You already had my mailbox full
So what, you're talking 'bout your ""feeling you's""
So what, never told you to buy me shoes
So what, now you're rolling with an attitude
Plus the word on the streets is you're a bug a boo
You make me want to throw my pager out the window

You call me from over your best friend's house
And it's not hot that I can't even go out with my girlfriends
Without you tracking me down
You need to chill out with that mess
'Cause you can't keep having me stressed
'Cause every time my phone rings it seems to be you
And I'm praying that it is someone else
So what?
Ain't even like I knew you
So what?
Tell your peoples I ain't feeling you
So what?
Don't call me I'll call you
Cause cupid ain't shoot me, he shot you

You want to hate me now like Nas
Cause you dos, tres, quartro
Thugs still in the dance
Ain't no need to bust you're A-K
We all can get along
Or we can do it Carlito's Way
Cause even though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death
I fear no evil, got the Lord present, standing Eagle
Way before birth I had this whole book memorized
I roll with murderers that just got baptized
I be allowed to see through the eyes of Zion
The New Jerusalem
So sing the hook and stop buggin'

Climbed up the rough side and got tough at times
But I remain, if I got the stuff to shine
And pull out the pump, protect mine
Survive in the game, hate on me 'cause you lame
They don't ever see your face or say your name
No more pain for me, no more misery, 'cause you history
I'm a hold on to what I got
Strap on to my perfection, strap on protection
My own direction, born to be the best at what I do
I'ma make it through, stompin' like a soldier in my big black boots
I keep 'em ""Jumpin', Jumpin',"" stayin' funky, funky for you
No matter who's that man that walk out of your life
You don't need 'em, don't be no heater
Long as I'm still breathin', not leavin' for no reason
Seen them come and go, one switch, they not gold
No house no mo', not even a condo
As long as I know how to love, I'm a stay alive
No need your game or style
They can't tame me 'cause I'm wild, not ashamed of stayin' down
Can the rain sit, and 'em things chromed out, spit
And in my game, no doubt, I'm a get paid in a big way, survivor!

Walk in to the beach house, lookin' so sparklin'
Brought two more female friends to join everybody
At the Mardi Gradi on the island
(Do you think I'm a nasty girl) 
That's what I heard
When I looked up it was Cheryl with sex apparel
Said she drove a 1998 Montero
I said a poncho, all about dinero
Head honcho, girl, you're soncho
Lets pronto to the condo
Where me and you could lay low and sip on Mo
Before the girl had a chance to respond
Got booty in the words about a female named Yvonne
Yvonne was a little freak I did last week
In the backseat of her mamas Yukon
Why you trippin', we were just flippin'
Only thing on my mind was hit and no commitment cause

Ooh, ah, ah

fliipin' with me
Understand I'm the man and that's the way it should be
Condos, I'm the most, parlay, pimpin' like style
Take a flight to relax in ? go and buck wild
In the room partner zoom straight gettin' on yours
? bathroom sinks and these carpeted floors
A friend and it all it started with a fuck in the end
Say my name, blaze the cane, then we started again
Salty water make a star, baby, take yourself far
Papa C-Notes eatin' shrimp, free drinks from the bars
Always first class friends, mafio dividends
Push it to the limit while I'm in it, name the place
and when cause

You hold it all inside

You gotta keep it real

And you know you wanna be mine 
So get your act together 
Cause you're running out of time

You pretend as if you don't want me

You make me wanna throw my pager out the window
Tell MCI to cut the phone calls
Break my lease so I can move
'Cause you a bug a boo, a bug a boo
I wanna put your number on the call block
Have AOL make my email stop
'Cause you a bug a boo
You buggin what? You buggin who? You buggin' me!
And don't you see it ain't cool

Its not hot that you be callin' me
Stressin' me pagin' my beeper
You're just non-stop
And its not hot
That you be leavin' me messages
Every ten minutes and then you stop by

When I first met you, you were cool
But it was game you had me fooled
'Cause twenty minutes after I gave you my number
You already had my mailbox full

(So wha,t you bought a pair of shoes)
(What now I guess you think I owe you)
(You don't have to call as much as you do)
(I'd give, 'em back to be through with you)

(Even if the Pope he said he liked you too)
I don't really care 'cause you're a bug a boo

Its not hot
That when I'm blockin' your phone number
You call me from over your best friends house
And its not hot that I can't even go out with my girlfriends
Without you trackin' me down
You need to chill out with that mess
'Cause you can't keep havin' me stressed

Destiny's Child,"How many times
Are you gonna apologize
About the same thing
And how many times
Can I take you back
When I'm not the one that's doing wrong
I thought maybe If I started praying
Then we would get better but
When I would pray, the answer would always come
Back to me, being done
But we're so hard headed
When we're in love

So I

I told myself
That I would make some changes
But the more I change
There's one thing that remains the same
I can't seem to shake ya
You seem to really have a hold on me

And every time that we break up
We turn around and make up
This can't go on now
I've gotta move on now
It's not the fact
I love you no more
But I've got to break this bad habit
Can't take this bad habit no more

I'm totally out of my element
I'm learning new ways to live
While you're in a comfort zone
Not even thinkin' (gotta think about me)
To call me when I get mad you buy me gifts
Thinkin' it's gonna solve every issue

From the girl callin' my phone
To the pictures that I saw

Destiny's Child,"Hey baby
I wish you could see what I have on right now
You so sexy
Imagine how intense it would be
To hold me right now
Our song's playing

At night, when you're far and I'm alone
I feel the fabric from your t-shirt
Close to my body
I can still hear your baritone
In my ear telling me you'll take it slow
And I was in the mirror playing a roll
Like you work it, I couldn't turn me on
So I fell asleep with the music on
Woke up again hearing the same old song, playing

(Oh) give it to me deeper
(Oh) giving me the fever
(Oh) now you got my feet up
This one is a keeper
Now the second verse is playing
(Oh) we tried to stand up
(Oh) hold me why while my hands up
(Oh) and the music picks up
Fantasies were shook up
I'm thinking to myself again

When you're not here (I sleep in your t shirt)
I wish you were here  (to take off your t shirt)
After we make love (I sleep in your t shirt)
Wake up in your t shirt
Still smell the scent of your cologne
When I need your feel (I sleep in your t shirt)
I need your help (to take off your t shirt)
After we make love (I sleep in your t shirt)
Wake up in your t shirt
Still smell the scent of your cologne

Outside I hear the rain on my windowpane
Hold up a minute, thought I heard your name
My mind, playing tricks on me again
I hear knocks at the door, is that baby home
Why couldn't it be reality
Looked at the clock it says 4:03
At nine he'll be arriving on a plane
Then we'll be making love and hearing the song again

(Oh) give it to me deeper
(Oh) giving me the fever
(Oh) now you got my feet up
This one is a keeper
Now the second verse is playing

Oh boy I've been waiting
Now my body's shaking
You're so deep, baby please, take it easy
I look at your face and
Got my heart racing
You're so deep, baby please, take it easy

Keep it right there
Oh, wait wait, yeah
Keep it right there
You driving me crazy

I'm crying out for some stability
Destroy my many insecurities

Need a love like no other not an ordinary love
Restore my joy, wisdom and courage

I found a new love, I found new, found a new love
I finally found it in God

That we would get better but
When I would pray the answer would always come back to me being done

We turn around and make up

But I got to break this bad habit
Can't take this bad habit no more

I'm totally out of my element
Learning new ways to live 
While you're in a comfort zone
Not even thinking (you couldn't think about me)
To call me, when I get mad you're buying me gifts thinking it's going to solve every issue
From the girl calling my phone(phone)
To the pictures that I saw(you know what I saw)
And every time you would break up with me for nothing at all
I've taken all I can take (I've taken all I can take)
But the way I live has got to change

Let me break it down
Have you ever loved somebody?
So much that you was just too blind to see, past
All of the pain they was causing you
Ladies do you feel me (do you feel me)
Have you ever loved somebody?
So much that you went against the right things
That you should do

For having me organize this meeting here today
And Kelly Steracki I also want to thank you

Beyonce Corleone from the South West
Ah Latavia Menser from the four-four
Our objective of this meeting today is to discuss
Destiny's Child's commandments of relationships

You know it's so unfortunate, so unnecessary
For us to end up with broken hearts
Yes godfather times have changed
Relationships aren't like the old days you know?

See what we need is a man of his word
All this, uh cheating, uh backstabbing, hating no more, no more
But godfather, how do we avoid all these mishaps?
It's obvious, the writing's on the wall, thou shalt not hate

And he was searching for a partner just like me

We landed and he said we just can't end it 
Cause he needed a little more time wit me

Destiny's Child,"You know, we've been spending a lot of time together and um, I was wondering do you:
(Feel the same way I do)
I can tell you, I know you need me to show you, but, it's better if I hear it from you.
You know what, let me explain myself.

It's seven am you're still here with me, and last night I held you tightly so.
What does that mean, you see I know what it means to me.
It means that I, I, wouldn't let you go.
Tell me, is your heart still spinning from the night before?
(You are real good yeah).
And you really need to let me know are you here just for, (sexual dealings).
See if you are then, (I), I just can't live a, (lie), cause I'm certain how I feel about you.
But if you tell me, (I), am the one and this is, (right), 
Then we can spend the night tonight like always.
But first you, gotta tell me

[Chorus]
That you (Feel the same way I do)
Don't think you know, that I won't let you know unless you (Feel the same way I do)
So if you tell me what I gotta do, before I get caught up in you.
Do you really (Feel the same way I do)
So tell me, tell me, us can be a good thing.
But you gotta (Feel the same way I do) do.

So now it midnight, haven't heard a reply.
But I can see the truth lies in your eyes.
Could it be that you tried, but I didn't see the sunset pass me by, when you were making love to me.
Said it three times, (you said) you love me, (after) you held me.
But then you never even said goodnight.
(Anything I ask of you) you give it, (when you wanted me) I submitted, still no commitment, but if I don't get it then,
(I) I just can't live a (lie), cause I'm certain how I feel about you.
But if you tell me, (I), I am the one and this is, (right), you can spend the night tonight like always.
Long as you first tell me

[Chorus]

Ooh I see your eyes, and I hear you calling.
When you're speaking and I need to hear something.
First thing I wanna hear (I've been meaning to tell you something).
The second thing is (If I can't have you I don't want nothing).

Who that knockin' at my door this time of night?
Ooh oh, hey baby.
What you doing over here so late?
I wanted to tell you somethin'.
I just, I don't know how to tell you right.
Do you have anything you want to say?
Alright, you know what, I love you

We apologized and then we compromised

You gotta keep it real

I can see right through you 
And you know you wanna be mine 
So get your act together 
Cause you're running out of time

Every time I see you with your boys 
You pretend as if you don't want me 
When you get home you call me on the phone 
And tell me how much you care 

Yo, close your eyes, shorty 
You're guaranteed to be hypnotized 
By the remix that Wyclef provides 
I don't care 'bout your size

Don't talk about trips 'cause I got's to make hits
When I'm done, I need someone to chill with

(Oh no)
Don't talk about planes 'cause I got's my own pilot
Don't talk about banks, my accountant just wires it
Don't talk about gear cause I got's my own line
So don't get mad cause you P S is hiring

Don't talk about it baby, be about it
What you say you got, I already got it
You heavy in the game but I'm saturated
You trying to figure me out, but you just can't figure me out

Tryn'a act like you don't see the Phantom
What?
(Am I killin' ya?)

'Cause you act like a girl, can't come up and run the club
(See nothin' new)
If you feel me all my ladies say
Fellas, change ya game

I'm just tired of hearing the same thang
(Oh)
See I need something different in my life, man
(Why you trying to figure out?)

You trying to figure me out, but you just can't figure me out

Don't look at me, crazy
I need more than just money
I just think you're caught up, flaws
A man don't know a good thing

That's why I wanna school you
And let you know who's who
And I believe once you get hip on game
I think you know what to do
No talk about loving, what you can do for me

Don't talk about it baby, be about it
What you say you got, I already got it
You heavy in the game but I'm saturated

Destiny's Child,"There are times I find it hard to sleep at night
We are living through such troubled times
And every child that reaches out
For someone to hold
For one moment
They become my own

And how can I pretend that I don't know
What's going on?
When every second
And every minute
Another soul is gone

And I believe that in my life
I will see
An end to hopelessness
Or giving up
Or suffering

Then we all stand together this one time
Then no one will get left behind
And stand up for life
Stand up
And here me sing
Stand up
For love

I'm inspired
And hope
For each and everyday
That's how I know that things are going to change
So how can I pretend that I don't know
What's going on?
When every second
And every minute
Another soul is gone

And I believe that in my life
I will see
An end to hopelessness
Or giving up
Or suffering

If we all stand together this one time
Then no one will get left behind
And stand up for life
Stand up
For love

And it all starts right here
And it starts right now
One person stand up man!
And the rest will follow
From the forgotten
And From the Unloved

I'm gonna sing this song,

And I believe
That in my life
I will see
An end to hopelessness
Or giving up
Or suffering

If we all stand together this one time
Then no one will get left behind
And stand up
For life
Stand up
And sing

Destiny's Child,"Hey baby
I wish you could see what I have on right now
You so sexy
Imagine how intense it would be
To hold me right now
Our song's playing

At night, when you're far and I'm alone
I feel the fabric from your t-shirt
Close to my body
I can still hear your baritone
In my ear telling me you'll take it slow
And I was in the mirror playing a roll
Like you work it, I couldn't turn me on
So I fell asleep with the music on
Woke up again hearing the same old song, playing

(Oh) Give it to me deeper
(Oh) Giving me the fever
(Oh) Now you got my feet up
This one is a keeper
Now the second verse is playing
(Oh) We tried to stand up
(Oh) Hold me why while my hands up
(Oh) And the music picks up
Fantasies were shook up
I'm thinking to myself again

When you're not here (I sleep in your t-shirt)
I wish you were here  (to take off your t-shirt)
After we make love (i sleep in your t-shirt)
Wake up in your t-shirt
Still smell the scent of your cologne
When I need your feel (i sleep in your t-shirt)
I need your help (to take off your t-shirt)
After we make love (i sleep in your t-shirt)
Wake up in your t-shirt
Still smell the scent of your cologne

Outside I hear the rain on my windowpane
Hold up a minute, thought I heard your name
My mind, playing tricks on me again
I hear knocks at the door, is that baby home
Why couldn't it be reality
Looked at the clock it says 4:03
At nine he'll be arriving on a plane
Then we'll be making love and hearing the song again

(Oh) Give it to me deeper
(Oh) Giving me the fever
(Oh) Now you got my feet up
This one is a keeper
Now the second verse is playing

Now my body's shaking
You're so deep, baby please, take it easy
I look at your face and
Got my heart racing
You're so deep, baby please, take it easy

Keep it right there
Oh, wait wait, yeah

What have you done to me
This crazy feeling I can't describe
It feels like love it must be love it must be love
Feels like snow caressing mountain tops
When I see your eyes from afar
All I can do is run with open arms
Love is all I got
I feel so at home
When we're alone, oh

Love, when I'm in your arms
Feels like I'm melting into you
You keep me so warm
Ooh, I feel so high above
Caught a glimpse of heaven in your eyes
Thanks for showing me love (your love so good)

Baby we will grow together; this is a joint endeavor
And there's nothing I'd rather see
Than the love in your eyes for me
'Cause this feeling is so surreal
You touch me places I didn't feel
I used won't but now I will trust in love
I'm elated and overjoyed.
Over this connection between a girl and boy
I was empty till you filled the void
I'm so in love

Open gates to realm of eternal night

I am one with the darkness

Of sorcerers departed and towers burned
Doom has taken shape and sealed Earth's fate
Still I live strange years
Stand beneath the stars

Recall years when the worlds sailed
Darkling tides in crimson skies
In galleries ever I search
For haunted crypts where no lamp burns

Lurking in the cavern deep within the mind
Crowning the throne of dreams with the blackened gems
Dwelling in the towers both ruined and vast
I am he who returns when the scythe shall fall

Free to ride the solar winds

Once I let the weakened minds disguise me
Once I thought I lost my outer shell

Why people fake ignorance
Inside they are scared to death
But too weak to react.

And there is no difference no rich and open
Minds. No change no further evolution, no
Wisdom earned by time. Where's the point
In racing endlessly when it's enough by far to

To me it's all the same

Crush the one that speaks
Just go ahead and tear the world apart
And let them pay just let them pay
For tearing out your heart

I will be the one that steals the smile
That steals the smile right off your face
And trust me now that I'll be here
Be there to count your days

Can you feel the silent suffering?

Can you make me wanna come alive
Can you make me die

Collision. The super rush, eternal buzz, the
Freaks affection now I'm counting snowflakes
And the cattle herd makes my head start
Spinning and my senses burn

Can you ever be forgiven for giving apathy
A prize. Can I ever turn my other cheek when
You kill before my eyes

Black gold's in my face. A fire's burning in

Your sins and dirty whores. Take me home,
Take me home. I've seen the pain, her aching

Take me home. I've seen the pain, her aching

The world. It's like the fate of humanity's
Decided by my words

Breath from the ground. Each grip I take every

To get right through all life a lessons
It's funny to me and I'm noticing that
Every tattoo I see is on the small of a back
It's like damn I can't refuse
All the great ideas that come with tattoos
Like first the rose, then the butterfly
Then the small little catch themes catch your eyes
And even Angelina Jolie got those
The only way you see those is with no clothes
So there's a few who knows
Maybe Brad Pitt know
Billy Bob saw a few so she got some more

Love is an art and I'm an artist
 
And one of the hot har-hardest tattoos I ever seen
Is the one on my wife, one that you'll never see

Eu não durmo mas pra mim 'tá tudo bem

E lá fora o vento sopra aquele som que a noite tem
Eu não ligo pois pra mim tá tudo bem

Se eu não faço mais questão de ter, uh uuh
Se eu não tenho mais, uh uuh, uh uuh

Passo o dia feliz sem você
Mais um dia feliz sem você

Se eu saio lá fora e 'tá escuro aqui
Não tenho mais nada pra me consumir
E pra mim tá tudo bem
A noite vai embora e é melhor assim
Aqui 'tá tranqüilo 'tá legal pra mim
E comigo tudo bem

Se eu não faço mais questão de ter, uh uh
Se eu não tenho mais, uh uh, uh uh

Passo o dia feliz sem você
Mais um dia feliz sem você
Passo o dia feliz sem você
Mais um dia feliz
Passo o dia feliz sem você
Mais um dia feliz sem você",Só Por Hoje,2004
Detonautas Roque Clube,"Peguei meu tênis e fui atras do meu melhor
Hoje é um dia quente tudo vai mudar
É que esta estrada vive sempre cheia assim
Se eu não seguir em frente quem vai me levar 

Tento olhar o sol
Quero me encontrar, sem medo de talvez errar então
E sempre fico assim
vou pro meu lugar
Não quero mais ficar parado em vão

E seja como for
E deixa acontecer
Seja como for

Se você não vem tudo bem vice e versa
O que é que tem vivo zen , eu não fico sem
Um bom motivo que me leve a um bom lugar
E quando chega a hora não demora ou ela vai passar
Eu não espero sempre faço acontecer
Sem desespero vejo o dia amanhecer
Sei que quem luta nunca vai ficar pra trás
Vem preparado que agora eu quero mais então
E que agora eu quero mais então",Tênis Roque,2004
Detonautas Roque Clube,"Penso no que faço
no que fiz e no que vou fazer
Hoje o seu retrato
só me mostra o que eu quero esquecer

Refrão:
Quando o sol se for meu amor vou onde você for
Quando o sol se for a luz indicará você pra mim

Passo o tempo todo
tudo passa passa solução
Sempre saio a noite
a noite sempre deixa a sensação

Se eu fechasse os meus olhos pra você
O que adiantaria essa tua ideologia
Se tua própria liberdade se transformasse em opressão

Que eu te quis também
Se ao menos eu pudesse te mostrar
Que o inferno são os outros

Vou mentir e dizer que eu não sou feliz

Mas saiba que eu também consigo viver só

De Seguir acreditando nesse nosso amor
E nada do que digam vai mudar
O que pensamos deixa estar
E agora vamos, já chegou!

Que esse amor não precisa esperar

Meu coração vai te mostrar
Que esse amor não precisa
Esperar, não precisa esperar!
