Love Arcade,"She wraps herself around me like a snake
She's like a bad habit I can't break
Got a tight squeeze she won't let me go
She runs my life like a pro

Goin down smooth like aging whine
Ever since I met you its been a rapid decline
Goin down easy like a sinking ship
You got me dizzy on a never ending trip

She's like a disease that I cannot cure
Ask everybody around she's so pure
She chooses what she wants to break
I don't know how much more this body can take oh

Goin' down smooth like aging whine
Ever since I met you its been a rapid decline
Goin down easy like a sinking ship
You got me dizzy on a never ending trip

Truth becomes blurry love becomes hate
Need help in a hurry before its too late
Tryin to leave you the pain just doubles
Hanging on to you is like hanging on a bubble
Tryin to leave you, you make curiosity grow
I know hanging on to you is like hanging onto a straw

Goin down smooth like aging whine
Ever since I met you its been a rapid decline
Goin down easy from blow after blow
You see me in pain you won't let me go
Goin down easy like a sinking ship
You got me dizzy on a never ending trip
Goin down quick like a plane crash
You can't find a bit, got me turnin into ash",Goin' Down Smooth,2006
Love Arcade,"You know I wouldn’t say it if it wasn’t true.
It’s 5'o clock and I’m thinking of you
And all the things you make me do
You know, I really want ya
Really want ya

Can’t keep my head straight
Dooie ooie ooie ooie

I want you now like I want you then
Falling in love with you, there is no end.
When you’re not here, I like to pretend
Because I really want ya
Really want ya

It’s love, I’m sure
I can’t ignore
Something so good
You I adore
Let me think of a metaphor...
Love is like...candy [I really want ya]
Your love is like candy... [Really want ya]
Wait, that’s a simile.

Keep it, keep it comin’

Love Arcade,"I just seen something its undescribale
Its undeniable for all of what it means
I just want one thing, for all the world to see
To plant a growing seed so you don't fade to dust

And my eyes are burning up, and it never was enough
There is nothing more to say, there's no way you'd let me stay
I'm about to lose my breath, sure enough will lead to death
Don't deserve to hear your voice, don't deserve to see you

I am too ashamed, its ver frightening
Its like a lightning that strikes you day in day
But one thing remembered I do on December
Month after September like every one member
Unlike the pretenders I know you

And my eyes are burning up, and it never was enough
There is nothing more to say, there's no way you'd let me stay
I'm about to lose my breath, sure enough will lead to death
Don't deserve to hear your voice, don't deserve to see you

And I wanna meet you half way
And I wanna love you everyday
And I will be here to stay
And I will never run a stray

And my eyes are burning up, and it never was enough
There is nothing more to say, there's no way you'd let me stay
I'm about to lose my breath, sure enough will lead to death
Don't deserve to hear your voice, don't deserve to see you",Moses,2006
Love Arcade,"You didn't care what anyone else would think
You were always there, the purest water to drink

Lift me up and kiss me like you always meant it
I am free you release me for the first time

And you open up and let me in
Your love enough to wash my sin

You look at me, there's no one else around
That I can see, the beauty I have found

Lift me up and kiss me like you always meant it
I am free you release me for the first time

And you open up and let me in
Your love enough to wash my sin",Open Up,2006
Love Arcade,"The weekend comes and there's not a lot to do I'm cherry picking
But you gotta get up gotta get up and call some body
Why, because your time is ticking

Hey did you forget I think its only been about two minutes
Two minutes what's that you say
There's a party going on today
Are you sure about that
Oh yes I am about as sure as ten kilos in a gram
Move it up, sell it, hit the block
Leave you dead, clear, shock

The party's hardly started and you're on your way departed
Got your drink on get retarded and just try not to get carded

Where did all these people come from 
It's like a music video get out the camera
You gotta get up gotta get up and move you body
Can you move your body, can you

Hey move to the left now move to the right, tell me what's the next step
Do the hustle, now that's that bring it on up and step it on back
Hey tell me what's that sound, the roof's caving in, everybody get down
Turn the bass up please, that's better

The party's hardly started and you're on your way departed
Got your drink on get retarded and just try not to get carded

(Let me hear the girls)
Ooh ooh I like it daddy like it when you throw it at me
(I know you do)
Ooh ooh I like it daddy like it when you throw it at me

Love Arcade,"I wonder how it woyuld be to have your arms around me
To have your lips like that whine to have your hands gently carressing 
Mine

All night in my bed she is in my head, I can't stop her I'm just a 
Passenger

As days go by I see that you were meant for me
It adds up easily so lets just let it be
The world will fade I don't care as long as you are there
We'll make the perfect pair we'll be like sonny and cher

All night in my bed she is in my head, I can't stop her I'm just a

Love Arcade,"Hey Sara 
Haven’t seen you in awhile
Don’t worry I’ve been working up a smile
I started doing drugs 
No I haven’t fell in love
About to quit the band 
But I think you’ll understand

I’m coming home 
(I’m coming home soon)

Love Arcade,"As medication to my eye, I look forward to see you walk by
Buy you anything in any size, I'll keep you spoiled in the high rise
The way you move that body of yours, you got no worries it'll open all 
Doors
That brand new car it can be yours, just give me more

Love Arcade,"Clap your heels oh you walk so fine
You look so good oh you have to be mine
Pardon me sir but do you have the time?
Why so many questions man I'm losing my mind?
Straighten me up 'cause I'm falling out of line
Better hurry up 'cause I'm running behind

You tease me, you play with me just like a toy
Oh please me give me something I enjoy

What do I do I think she's coming over here
I ask my friends but they think I had too many beers
But I don't drink, what's the other explanation here?
Look what you're wearing, I think your eye is turning queer
But wait a second that can't be right
I just went shopping for this stuff last night
He just went shopping for this stuff last night
Whoa I think she's coming oh wait no she's not
Oh my gosh she's so hot

Love Arcade,"Nights are slim, get my hands on a new fortune
Maybe one to take away the pain
Days are gone, they were never here for long
The drift of rivers stronger with the rain

And I'm not one to waste, waste my life away
Faced with my last day

The sun will set, west or east, let's make a bet
But you don't understand what I say (I've seen everything, everything)
Evening is all of it but beginning
The time it takes to throw it all away

and I'm not one to waste, waste my life away
Faced with my last day

Kick sand in my eyes I am left in the dust
Kick sand in my eyes I am left in the dust 
And there's nothing I can do

And I'm not one to waste, waste my life away
Faced with my last day",Waste My Life,2006
Love as Laughter,"Top of the holly jolly
My holy collar is falling off
Part of the incantation
A love invasion of many parts

All parts of me love you in your leotard

Call off my intuition
My inhibition is coin dry
Come and lay down with monsters
Like I have and see why

All parts of me all lined up in the color bar
All parts of me love you in your leotard

All parts of me all lined up in the color bar
All parts of me love you in your leotard
",All Parts of Me,2008
Love as Laughter,"Grab some grapes and leaves, man
You can never tell
When you'll have to change your face
And hide your trophies well

Comin? down the mountain
Or goin? to your home
The village has evacuated
Now you gotta roam

Your feet could start to moan
And your eyes don't see too clear
The darkest dreams could come
And shake your faith to steer

Remember the sun
All from memory
Close your eyes and run circles
?Round its enemies

Remember the sun
Before you awake
Remember all the reasons
And bake it into your cake

Then we'll all come over
Bring the coconut flakes
We're gonna get stoned with ya
Laugh at your mistakes

I know it's been hard to take
And I know you wanna run
But just try to stay in one place
And have a little fun

I know it's been hard to take
And I know you wanna run
But just try to stay in one place
And dance before it's done
",Coconut Flakes,2008
Love as Laughter,"I felt this target, you say you never held a whip
But it looks so cool in your grip
Ah, now I could never live without you
That's what you'd like to send them an unwritten script

Live through this, no one showed you the clips
Oh, and no one showed me where I slipped
Oh, so now the world's got me surrounded
That's what you'd like to send them faulty evidence

Some recent transmissions
Careening through towns and friends
Oh, so here's where our spy business ends
Oh, 'cause I really liked to love ya
Don't you pretend we were wrong

And we can find a place to stand
Oh, 'cause I really liked to love ya
Don't you pretend

Love Candy,"(She!) She told me that she loved me,
And like a fool I believed her from the start
(She!) She said she'd never hurt me,
But then she turned around and broke my heart.
Why am I standing here
Missing her and wishing she were here?

(Hey!) She only did me wrong
(Hey!) I'm better off alone.
(She!) She devoured all my sweet love,
Took all I had and then she fed me dirt

It was such a joke to see the way it hurt.

Missing her and wishing she were here?

I saw you had flavour and I wanted a taste of this sweet thing 
But now there's so much more 
'Cause everyday I'm thinkin' about what my baby has in store
 
Trust and believe, day to day, you never doubt her 
'Cause I used to have a dream girl, but now I found her 
And she's by my side, she's my pride, my all 
Ten foot tall, that's how I feel, I never fall, I never fell 

Oh, what the hell, I'll admit it, love was the target and you hit it 
So as I watch you sleep in the middle of the night 
You open your eyes and I know it's so right
 
Two hearts, two minds, two people, one love 
And the way you're makin' me feel, it's like you're sent from up above 
Your touch, your smell, your face, a unique breed 
It's only love but it's all that I need 

In the mornin' when the sun shines down on your body 
I know we're really makin' love now 
In the mornin' when the sun shines down on your body 
I know we're really makin' love now 
In the mornin' when the sun shines down on your body

We're really makin'
We're really makin'
We're really makin'

I'm glad that I been found, always wanted you around 
Keepin' me lost for words, yeah, I know how that sounds 
Now I been to many places and I seen many things 
But nothin' that I know can ever make my heart sing like you do 
It's like a voodoo, you know what I'm sayin'? 
Baby girl, I ain't playin' 
I'm glad that I'm one to rock your world 
'Cause honey - yeah...

Get off the freeway, exit 106 and ""Park""ed it
Ash tray, flip gate, time to spark it
Gucci collar for dollar, got out and walked it
I spit game cause baby I can't talk it
Warm, sweating, it's hot up in this joint
Vokal tank top, on at this point
You with a winner so baby you can't loose
I got secrets can't leave Cancun
So take it off like your home alone
You know dance in front your mirror while you're on the phone
Checking your reflection and telling your best friend
Like ""Girl I think my butt getting big!""

Stop pacing, time wasting
I gotta a friend with a pole in the basement what?
I'm just kidding like Jason oh
Unless you gon' do it
Extra, extra, eh, spread the news check it
Nelly took a trip from the Luna to Neptunes
Came back with something thick and it fitting in sasoons
Say she got a thing about cutting in restrooms, oh

Just because you turned your back on what we had
You turned your back on me
On the times we've had and the lines we sang
The x's on your hands are faded as your heart
You don't care about anything anymore
You let me down
It's all on you to show this world what you're reall made of
This day is gone and my respect is lost
But this life is far from over
I'm still holding on
Showing the world just what I love
No one cares for what's expected of me
No ideals that threaten me

I'm here until the end
I love my life, and I love my friends

Look out, cause that is no illusion!

While the moon glows and is burning hot
As my blood flows I can feel the final shot

Love of Lesbian,"Quiero planear sobre tu tierra estable
Quisiera regresar a ese viento suave

Cuando yo solo era brisa
Acuérdate bien, que al no poder mirarme
Sabía que existía solo si a ti te podía mover

De ahí me llevé varias canciones de aire
Recuerdos de viajes que mares del trópico adquirí

Fue después de veinte inviernos
Acuérdate bien, por las presiones de aire

Mientras tanto tú, tú tan anclada en tus raíces
Con esfuerzo percibiste que invertí mi dirección

Y de quien siembra vientos, 
¿Qué se dice? Ya lo sabes
Solo cuando te quebraste, 
Solo entonces me di cuenta, era yo

Crecido en su arrogancia por sí mismo 
Dio una vuelta en espiral
Y ese huracán con la luz de lunas de hiel
A mil metros del suelo 
A duras penas se dio cuenta que arrasó bajo el volcán

Toda sed de comprender cualquier motivo, el sinsentido
Ha dejado a hombres de ciencia sin salir de sus porqués

Fenómenos del mal, desastres, que vienen y van
Que van, que van, que van sucediendo
Sin aviso fiable o preventiva medición

Tu tierra antes dormida de tu lava se llenó
Cerramos aeropuertos, desviamos los aviones del perdón

Ya no hay nada en mí, solo restos que destruyen
Y mi huracán de una escala de fuerza seis
Crecido en su arrogancia a duras penas 
Se dio cuenta que arrasó bajo el volcán, 
Tu volcán
Ni siquiera el mismo diablo lo haría mejor

Y el huracán de una escala descomunal
Crecido en su arrogancia 
Por sí mismo dio una gran vuelta en espiral

Love of Lesbian,"Cuando el mago enfermó era día de función

Si caen gotas avisando que hay tormentas

El que sentía pilotando aeroplanos de tinta y papel
Y de aeropuerto un diario en blanco

Quiero el perfume del ahora y el aroma de una flor de piel

Y era inercia

O aquellos cuentos que al cobarde hacen andar
Fui un adulto precoz
Sietemesino de una nube azul y densa que me expulsó
Y que aprendió cayendo

Uuu, que los pegados a la tierra nos detestan
Solo por probar
De dar un paso al ras de cielo

¿Dónde estás planeador?

Que es mi piel coral

De intermitente aparición
Como un ángel hallado en un ascensor
Qué bien funcionas como recuerdo
Acojo en mi hogar
Palabras que he encontrado abandonadas en mi palabrera
Examino cada jaula y allí
Ladrando vocales y consonantes
Encuentro sucios verbos
Que lloran después de ser abandonados
Por un sujeto que un día fue su amo
Y de tan creído que era

Prescindió del predicado
Esta misma semana
Han encontrado a un par de adjetivos transtornados
A tres adverbios muertos de frio
Y a otros tantos de la raza pronombre
Que sueñan en sus jaulas
Con ser la sombra de un niño
Señalo entonces
A las palabras que llevan más días abandonadas
Y me las llevo a casa
Las vacuno de la rabia y las peino a mi manera
Como si fueran hijas únicas
Porque en verdad todas son únicas
Acto seguido
Y antes de integrarlas en un parbulario de relatos o canciones
Les doy un beso de tinta
Y les digo que si quieres ganarte el respeto
Nunca hay que olvidarse los acentos en el patio

A veces les pongo a mis palabras
Diéresis de colores imitando diademas
Y yo sólo observo como juegan en el patio de un poema
Casi siempre te abandonan demasiado pronto
Y las escuchas en bocas ajenas
Y te alegras, y te enojas contigo mismo
Como con todo lo que amamos con cierto egoísmo
Y uno se queda en casa
Inerte y algo vacío
Acariciando aquel vocablo mudo llamado silencio
Siempre fiel, siempre contigo
Pero todo es ley de vida

And fix up the white house

If I won't try, I won't go
I'll never leave, I won't go
Can't believe it, I won't go!
No, not far!

Move your left, move your right
I kept it in my head and I kept trying to fight
I said, mhm move your left, move your right
Come a little closer if you like the limelight!
I said mhm move your left, move your right!
I want to surround and keep your here in my sight
I said move your left, move your right
Getting abuse 'cause everyone's taking all their time
They chase and flex the beat, it's on my mind
Moves like that aren't cool, or even crime
Now they one-handed, won't land it
Won't stand it, Clean Bandit

Here's a touch, ?
Relax the tempo, sips some movato
And if I get too animato
Tan my face with that ?
Aliente, mezzoforte, allegro or andante
I can make this voice
Staccato ?
I don't know, skip a beat, we're rushing now, we feel the heat
The doors are open, but the ?
Is this the place, is the final round!
Cruising at the speed ?
Watching the beat, we'll get to Vienna
Without a doubt the strings are fine, the bass is out
Give us a beat, you wrote the ?

Couple of skip beats, a couple of movements out
Now we made it to Mozart's house!
Couple of skip beats, a couple of movements out
Couple of skip beats, a couple of movements out
Couple of skip beats, a couple of movements out
This is Mozart's House!

You think it's stupid?
You think it's repetitive?
Well, it's repetitive!",Mozart's House,2014

I've been to Rio de Janeiro
I love the fun in the sun and the people
In Rio de Janeiro, it's so exciting to see,
no matter where you go

Any time, day or night, everything is so alive
Music there is really hot
You should see 'em do the Rio rock
Nothing like it nowhere else
It's a feeling that I've never felt
Never stops, never ends
It blows your mind just being there

I went to Sugar Hill the other night
From the top you see the city lights
Took the cable car to the other side
The moon above was big and bright
Then I saw this huge crowd
People dancing and singing loud
People smiled as I walked around
I felt so good, so I got down

Why I don't mind
Dead line there's nothing for me
Seize the day or freeze the frame till you get back,

I'm looking for a friend to borrow
Someone to erase the line
And kill that mess that fills my mind

And I don't want to waste tomorrow
And be the one who hated me

That I'll never understand

Didn't know what else to do

I had to have it all
And ran into a wall
And I didn't stop to see
Plain reality

now that I left the whirlpool
I'm walking straight again
My life is back to normal

But it seems I touch the stars instead
And now it feels like love is all dead

I'll be alright
Oh yes, I'll be okay
But I'll still be waiting
For you to blow me away

The space, embrace, the rise and fall
Just something to hold on to and recall
I can't beat gravity 
The supreme dream of feeling free
I must be my own enemy

stuck in the wrong dimension
I'd give my soul for sweet redemption

She's a flower, I can paint her, she's a child of the sun,

to know where my lucky love belongs oh no.

Love
What does it mean
To live between
The beginning and ending of love
Where do you go
To get to know
The reason why a brand new feeling
Comes to take you
Away from reason

Love
How do you know
The things you do
You do not only from need
And not from greed
But only from love

Love
When do you get to be
Someone who can give
And live without hurting
Someone you love
Why do we grow
And never show
The little that we know love

A candle in the window, it dances and it swirls
How beautiful the snow tonight, how beautiful the world

Makes my love run deeper when I see how hard you tried
And just like you, the snow falls silent in the night

How beautiful a candle in the window, it dances and it swirls

Lovemongers,"The Queen of Light took her bow and then she turned to go
The Prince of Peace embraced the gloom and walked the night alone

Oh, dance in the dark night, sing to the morning light
The darkest night, a force tonight, and time will tell us all

Oh, throw down your plow and hoe, rest not till you're going home
Side by side we walk the might, the darkest of them all

I hear the horses thunder down in the valley below
I'm waiting for the angels of Avalon, waiting for the eastern glow

The apples of the valley hold the seeds of happiness
The ground is rich from tender care, which they do not forget, no, no
Dance in the dark night, sing to the morning light

The apples turn to brown and black, the tyrant's face is red

Oh, sing if you can't cry, pick up your soul and fly
The sky is filled with good and bad, and mortals never know

Oh well, the night is long, the beads of time pass slow
Our eyes on the sunrise, waiting for the eastern glow

The pain of war cannot exceed the woe of aftermath
The drums will shake the castle wall, the Ringwraiths ride in black (ride on)

War is the common cry, pick up your swords and fly
No comfort here, the violent night, that night face so cold

Oh dance in the dark of night, sing to the mornin' light 
The the hay, the light, the face of night to bring the balance back, bring it back

At last the sun is shining, the clouds of blue roll by
With flames from the dragon of darkness, the sunlight blinds his eyes

Bring it back, bring it back, bring it back

I had yet to know well In peace as I lay I look back on the day And the voice of my father 
I still hear him say ?Oh well, Oh well. 
It's just another noel. Where is the king of Israel? 

On the next noel I remember it well 
With my own little boy and the stories to tell 
'Bout a star in the sky on a beautiful night 
And the shepherds and cattle alone in his light 

Oh tell oh tell me about the noel 
Born is the king of Israel Little stockings hung with care 
Hoping Santa will be there Little footsteps on the roof 
Down the chimney there's your proof there's your proof 

On the last noel All I hear is a bell And it's guiding me on to my home immortal 
All around I see My friends are in sight 
And they're guiding me on to the beautiful light

Wearing clothes from another day 
They sit close together two halves of a whole 
Watching the grandchildren play

See a corpse stretched in the Strand
See a man dodge 'round the corner...
Mackie's friends will understand.

Like so many wealthy men:
Mack the knife acquired his cashbox
God alone knows how or when

Jenny Towler, she turned up lately
With a knife stuck through her breast
While Macheath, he walks the embankment,
Nonchalantly unimpressed

And the ghastly fire in Soho,
Seven children at a go--
In the crowd stands Mac the knife, but

Whose assailants still at large
Violated in her slumbers

Love is pure gold and time a thief.

Comes to you as no surprise

He's running around breaking all the rules

What's he trying to put you through

Touched him with your sweet caress

Forget about him
Let him go

Loverboy,"Burning up the miles, there's a full moon out tonight
I've got a high-heel Venus, doing twice the speed of light
Crank it up through the gears--see what she can do
Women and cars--everything they say is true

Stand in line - No! No!
Wasting time - No
Friday night, Friday night
I just got paid--no sleep 'til Monday
Friday night, Friday night
Who cares, it's only money
I've been bidin' my time, listen to the Boss man scream
Workin' forty hours, payin' for this dream machine
'Cause I'm living proof - every mad-dog has his day
I'm going to find me a woman--head out on the Old Highway

Loverboy,"All day I've been banging the walls,
Like a prisoner in a cell
If I don't get out I'm going to lose my mind
There's got to be more for me--I'm tired of the same old scene
I can't wait to see that face--to say goodbye--bye, bye
I want to say goodbye
I got something inside of me
That I don't intend to waste, I've got dreams baby I can't forget
I've been looking all around and there's nothing left for me
There's only one way out and girl I'm going to take it

Push me, pull me, never get a minute to yourself
Pure hell, get you if you let it, stand up, sit down,
All I ever get is your backtalk, back off, push me to the limit
I lead a double life, I come alive at night

I had champagne milkshake for breakfast
But I know where I'll sleep tonight
I've got a blue-eyed earthquake--she's lyin' in my bed
Ain't it a wonderful life

Lovex,"Few drops left of my hope
I bleed in the name of faith
Decisions I've made, decisions of fools
Why am I bleeding for you

Missing the one who gave me nothing
The one who dreamed my dreams away

Why am I bleeding in my, bleeding on my soul
Why am I bleeding for you

Flaming pride in your eyes
Out of the ashes I'll build mine
Reason and feelings will never meet in me
Why am I bleeding for you

I couldn't live life like you could
I'm still the one misunderstood
I couldn't be the dream,
The lonely heart to seal your scheme
I couldn't live the life you love

Lovex,"Why didn't I embrace
Those days you spent with me
For now when I look back in time
It's too easy to see

While I lived my dream
I was seeking a fantasy
And here I lie all alone again
Drown in memories

You're so far away from me

I live to love again
But it won't do you any good to see me 
When I die a little more
And all the vanity

Has vanished from my world
Just to show me 
How I die a little more

I'm bound to stumble
Every time I try to fly
Can't get up, can't take a breath
I fall down, I cry

No light in the end
Storm after the rain
Only thing that I've got left
Is the blood inside my veins

Here's somethin'
I think I can leave you with
There was nothin' that I liked
Better than to kiss your lips
Kiss your lips, kiss your lips

Here's somethin'
I think I can leave you with
There was nothin' that I liked
Better than to kiss your lips
Kiss your lips, kiss your lips

Low Pop Suicide,"I remember being at your hand
I remember taking my time
I remember everything like it was yesterday
Maybe not

How good are you at this?
How good of you and me
How good can it feel
When everything comes down
To what kind of zombie you can be

All that done and all that said
After all this time and you just seem to be here

My eyes are passing out
Before your lips can read me
From the book that tells me why I love you
And that just leaves me here to wonder, why?

I had my talk with God
He said it's all workin' out
He has a bigger plan
And it's still in better hands
In case you don't know

All that done and all that said
And all this time and you just seem to be here

My eyes are passing out
Before your lips can read me
From the book that tells me why I love you
And that just leaves me here to wonder
How I ever got so far away
From things that really matter, zombie in me

All that done and all that said
All this time and you just seem to be here

Yo Aladdin, make sure my microphone is on
No wait a minute - hm-hm, now let me check my tone
(Before I start rockin) Yo, what we're callin this homes?
(Ain't nothin goin on...) word
Well, if it ain't nothin but a funky song, I'm in it to win it
Properly fitted, so let's get with it
My lyrical format breaks and bends the rules
For those of you who want to battle my crew
I come from the family down with Priority
Peace to N.W.A and Eazy-E
And to the homies everywhere that's down with Low Pro
y'all want funk? Yo, yo, now here we go
Can I come on, or should I come off smooth and dope?
Spectacular, I make a amateur choke
You see, it's gotta be funky, doper than the average funk song
That's why I didn't come off strong
I chose a laid back jack and watched the others swoop and holler
They try to kick funk, but yo, why did they bother
This is pure funk, so y'all sing along
(Ain't nothin goin on but a funky song)

[ VERSE 2: W.C. ]
Funk - the word for the day that I speak upon
It's like a drug, you could say that I'm sprung
Every time that I speak I pertain to a funky crowd
Turn up the radio, make sure that it's loud
The woofers are bumpin, the tweeders and tweetin
The bass is kickin, doubt's about to start rippin
All these MC's sound alike screamin off of funky tracks
Got the nerve to put the garbage on wax
Artificial MC's, I break em with ease, they get dunked
They all lack the true meanin of funk
A street hardcore sample with a positive tip
This here is so funky, all I need is a mothership
A pair of twelves and a mic in my hand, see
So I can get busy for those down with me
Have you yellin my name while I pertain to the brain
Cause when it comes to funk, I'm leavin permanent stains
So change arrange and yo, I ain't a new jack, gee
Aladdin gave me the mic, so I couldspeak my piece
Funk, the universal language, now can you swing it?
Some tried, but came softer than a Danish
Dunkenhein rappers is soft, they can't compete
Now here's a dope record tooken out of the backstreets
y'all know the words, so yo, sing along
(Ain't nothin goin on but a funky song)

[ VERSE 3: W.C. ]
So now we come to the final verse of the song
I came to short-circuit, so go and clap along
Wave your hands in the air while you shout and go off
But keep away from the stage, because you might get tossed
Yo, now here's somethin that I know that you like
Somethin funky, but yet though, it's gotta be hype
So sing along, even though when I'm gone
(Ain't nothin goin on...)
Peace
(...but a funky song)

Now we be ducking and bucking and picture girls while they're sucking
I'm coming harder than fuck and other putos be rocking
Up on the mic it's cracking, I'm Maniac while I'm rapping
The fattest Philly I'm packing while all the Low Pros is jacking
In my neighborhood it's all good, the homies are deep
I got a four-o and more, I'm getting high and it's all on me
Gangster'd out, no doubt, mobbing saying fuck it
Still rolling hella deep with the homies in a bucket
I ain't giving a fuck, I started with the gang
My homies are here and they got my back
I'm drinking a brew, I'm smoking a sack
I'm blowing to the brain and I'm sporting all black
Ese don't you know I bang Sureno, I'm a fool too
Mobbing with the homies loading cuetes saying fuck you
Drinking, smoking, and busting lines of coke too
Dancing, freaking, and fucking all night long
On a regular basis, all to the grill, fuck at the pad then off to the hood
Drinking a brew and acting a fool, once again ese I thought you knew

[Chorus: Royal T (Lil' Rob)]
Keep it gangsta homey, keep it gangsta
(Spanish Fly tell it like it is till the day we die)
Keep it gangsta homey, keep it gangsta

My life is quicker than ever to grab the mic and deliver
Up on a regular basis is how we're handling cases
See me disfiguring faces on fools who tripping in places
I flash my nine in the sky, I'm getting high till I die
I let a shot in the air, 'cause where it falls I just don't really care
I ride till the wheels fall off and they ain't gonna fall off
Rolling with a pistol grip sawed off
Bang once and my name's been out
Crazy gangster representing the South
Westside what I'm talking about, Old Town what I'm talking about
Kill him and I'm finna bust that shit
Coming through with fifteen and a clip
You thought that Maniac would slip
Never me, and life's a bitch
'cause strapped with extra clips, air fifteen with a grip of Smiths
West on mine, six to the spine, aiming to delete on mines
619 down to bust a rhyme
Rest In Peace Speedy, I keep you on my mind
It was no doubt your cats are in the mix
Leave us two alone and we're coming up on shit

[Chorus]

[Silencer]
The magical thug with the magical bullet
And I'm coming around with a magical spell so
Get away, keep away when you see Silencer coming out to get ya
What you want to do, I got the cross-bow
Enemies are gonna die and I kill them real slow
Picture any toon blazing up at the moon
Your time is up, now you die from a bloody wound
That's what's gonna happen everytime I come attacking
I'm thinking of the weapon and the bodies I be stacking
On a mission, I'm packing my ammunition
I'm sticking these sons of bitches for snitching like bitches motherfucker
What you want to do, are you afraid
It's all about the Silencer, that's the name
We're some crazy motherfuckers from the West Coast
Smoking Mary Jane and we pimp hoes

You're running on a mission, no competition
I'm coming at you with my ammuntion
We be the baddest around
The Silencer from San Diego is not fucking around
And that's for real ese
So now I'm blasting and rapping, and capping, jacking, harassing
My enemies are gonna die, 'cause here I come to assassin
Southern Cali in Regals, Impalas, strapping the balas, the balas
Ah shit, pelones smoking marijuana
Every night smoke a big fat blunt
And I'm never gonna stop until I get fucked up
Califa Thugs coming at you and it just don't stop
And we got the fine bitches at the same old spot

It's the vato loco who ain't no joke
Smoking and choking the indo smoke
Roll it up, light it up
Pass to the next, now hit em up
Get loc'ed out, smoked out, choked out
Never no doubt what I'm all about
I'm chilling in the studio gaining hoes like Rogain
Getting hoes like whoa, until in the morning
Crack of dawn
And I've wipe the shit out of my eyes
Then I'll do it again like cup of gin
There I go out to sin
Never will I hit the pig
So fucked up off this cup of gin
And then I'll rap my shit again

Bald head lunatics all ready for some gangsta shit
What up, blaze that shit up
And pass it this way, so we can parly

Chipping em off what they hitting for, make the whole planet rock
Yeah strickly for the players and thugs
Who been flossing them dubs, skating on chrome rolling up blunts
High sign me between the bitches on the streets
Acting a fool, bang in the corner where the homey creeps
Southside for life baby
The chronic smoke and Southern dues got me acting crazy
California life style, just living it up
Surrounded by them bitches who be giving it up
Now let's toast for the coast that we all love the most
And go for broke and get a shit load of chronic smoke

Califa Thugs hoping to see me, smoking up on the bud what
Haters do not like it, got a big dick for you to suck, now what
Cruising through the enemy territory
Not given a fuck packing big nuts 'cause it's manditory, end of story
That's how it is on these Cali streets
Not packing a heat you're gonna get beat, another casualty
'cause I'm creeping, deceiving, no position is tweeking
Gonna get this bullet's weaking while he's leaking
Now from my milli he's sleeping
Sleeping like the pussy that I was beating last night
Seeking like a private down with no clue inside
My victim, I seek em and whip em with my pistola
Smoking lots of mota, I'm the one que controla
I'm more Evil then Kenevil, people you see me in a Regal
Fuck my enemigos, 'cause I'm still like an illegal bitch

I went to follow them to find from where they came
Over a hill and then underneath a bridge
Down by a riverbank I stood along a ridge

The voice in the meadow, accompanied by rain
Such a sound to behold, singing this refrain

There's a river to cross, a mountain to climb
A bridge for you to build over the tide
When the water is deep, the valley is low
Wash away your troubles and watch that river flow

I followed that sound in the things that we said
Got me out of a cabin where a gun was next to bed
I'd been laid low for the things I had done
Then these words appeared to me on the tip of my tongue

I can't stop singing them over and over again
Don't remember not knowing then, when it all began
It's like some ancient someone came over a hill
So you might think you know something but you don't know nothing 'til

There's a river to cross, a mountain to climb
A bridge for you to build over the tide
When the water is deep, the valley is low
Wash away your troubles and watch that river flow

So I'm carrying this melody with me everywhere
When my burden gets heavy amidst most all my cares
Through this life we're living, you got to take it day by day
You never know what's coming or going along the way

There's a song for every person, a cure for every pain
Just keep singing, you'll find tracks in the rain

She brings home her pay for love
For love

She says: We've got to hold on to what we've got
'Cause it doesn't make a difference if we make it or not
We've got each other and that's a lot for love -
We'll give it a shot

We're half way there
Livin' on a prayer
Take my hand and we'll make it
I swear, livin' on a prayer

Tommy got his six string in hock
Now he's holding in what he used to make it talk
So tough, it's tough
Gina dreams of running away
When she cries in the night
Tommy whispers: Baby
It's okay, someday

We've got to hold on to what we've got   
We're half way there
Livin' on a prayer
  
We've got to hold on ready or not
You live for the fight when it's all that you've got
We're half way there
Livin' on a prayer
  
We're half way there
Livin' on a prayer
  
We're half way there

Low Strung,"I want to run, I want to hide
I want to tear down the walls that hold me inside
I wanna reach out and touch the flame
Where the streets have no name

I want to feel sunlight on my face
I see that dust cloud disappear without a trace
I wanna take shelter from the poison rain
Where the streets have no name, oh oh

Where the streets have no name
Where the streets have no name
We're still building then burning down love
Burning down love
And when I go there, I go there with you
It's all I can do

The city's a flood
And our love turns to rust
We're beaten and blown by the wind
Trampled into dust

I'll show you a place
High on the desert plain
Where the streets have no name, oh oh

Where the streets have no name

We're still building then burning down love
Burning down love
And when I go there, I go there with you

Blown by the wind

Low vs Diamond,"If you had eyes like golden crowns and
Diamonds in your fingertips you'd waste it
If shining wisdom passed your lips and
Traveled to the ears of God you'd waste it
And so I hate that you're overrated most
Revered and celebrated because you'll waste it

Then again it's good to get a call
Now and then just to say hello
Have I said I hate to see you go
I hate to see you go

But ever time you close a door and nothing
Opens in its place you've wasted
And when you speak the words you know
To those who know the words themselves
You're wasted
You're such a classic waste of cool, so afraid to
Break the rules in all the wrong places

Smell so good when she get wet and sticky
You lift me, girl you the bomb
Got a nigga blowin' like Cheech and Chong
A bong, a blunt, or a paper square
It really don't matter she'll take you there
You been my gal since the age of thirteen
And it's funny to me, you still make me fiend
You put a spell on me with the green voodoo
You love when my boys come and run us a choo choo
Mary-Jane deep in the game
The way I feel words can't explain
You been true to me, stood by my side
I wake up and get my mornings first high
Other hoes wonder why they get no love
'Cause Mary got a big ol' but, huh

Oh let the Mary-go-round, pass the sweet

If yous a Jane user
Throw your hands in the air with this muthafuckin three time user
Producer, wanna cool my future (pass the sweet)
Pass the Medusa, I never knews her
Who ya, who ya think ya are
Ya fuckin with a dopehouse shootin' star

But my wife Mary-Jane I never get divorced

The hoes sick cause them jealous bitches wanna
Vyla coma vana marijuana
You was born in Mexico but I took the chance
And brought your ass across to the promise lands
I love to lay you down so soft in my swisha
Act like a freak and let all my niggaz hit ya
I got your picture on all my walls

Can't see how you helped me through the struggle

Oh god, I'm hollin' holla, Happy throwed, that's what they yelling
When I roll up in my G-4, we came to spend a couple stacks
Shorts, t-shirts on caps, and we gone drink
Till my people collapse, so line em up
To the end of the bar, I ain't playing slick
Here go a couple of dollars so keep em coming quick
And say what's up ma', she said what's up though
I seen it in her face that the broad was a cut throat
And she's a hustla, she like to stack her chips
And break bread with the click and roll the fancy whips
She told me, ain't nothing fin to stop our shine
And we ain't sipping cristal we sip the rolly with lime

She dance the cumbias
She dance meringue

I want to know her name...
She's top notch, only be working with hot shots
Looking so famous she's training in hot rock
Dirty dancing drop tops, keeping it on pop
Doing them crunk dances, licking a loli-pop
She make it bang like bazookas, she's sweeter than my asuka
Hmm, mami chula nobody gone do it cooler
Crimination is passion, she smoke a sweet while she dancing
y'all might be staring and glaring but baby ain't even glancing
She got the real McCoy, now she gone fill your boy

I sit at the window and watch the rain, Hi-Lili, Hi-Lili, Hi-Lo
Tomorrow I'll probably love again, Hi-Lili, Hi-Lili, Hi-Lo

A tear for him and one for me, and one for under the cedar tree
And one for where ever my love my be, and then I shall weep no more

Hardened kiss, her lip gloss sweet.

Please exorcise me
Please, please exorcise me

I woke up on a Saturday night
Didn't feel like trying, but I missed the real life
Sippin' on caffeine, wakin' at 5
Working 9 to 9, and whinin' about
My bank account going down by the minute.
With the suits on bank
I hoped to see me thrive.

And not too long 'till I find myself
Gettin' high with strangers, takin' a trip to
Heaven with a bottle of gin in hand,
Hopin' high would help me swallow everything.
I lose myself with your body beside me,
Lying lifeless, helpless, heaven help us.
Hope for the boys on the lower east side,
Throwin' back their hearts on the lifeline
Makin' a dime.

So long Sara V.
So long Sara V.
So long Sara V.
So long.

And the girls undressed on the high street
Callin' it quits just to get a little bit.
And I hope someday you and I will find the life
through the world in the suburbs, there we hide.

So long Sara V.
So long Sara V.
So long Sara V.
So long.

Take a little breath, take a little breath
Everybody knows we can't go down from here.
And the kids in the wilderness
Never been stopped by the cops for the color of their skin
And I think too bad, nearly everyone who can
Buy my record has the money to keep themselves
From knowing that the truth is that you get rich and
Everyone else just lies beneath you

So long Sara V.
So long.",I Killed Sara V.,2014

Lowell George,"I was raised in the ruins, mama, 'till I was thirteen
Every day I heard the radio
Every night I had the same old dream
To sing a song, oh, baby, to watch my name in lights
If you wanna see your dream come true
Honey child, you gotta get right down and fight
Well I sailed cross the ocean, girl, I felt so all alone
Many times I thought about goin' right back home
But the Joy I found in song gave me the will to carry on

[Chorus]
Live your life the way you want to
Don't let fools lead you astray
Live you dreams so you hold on to
All you need along the way

I was payin' my dues right here in the land of the free
All the time I learned to sing along
I could not speak and I could barely see
Still all the while I knew where I was at
But the people that believed in me
Lord, I could count them all in seconds flat
Well, someday I would be, I knew it all along
A gentleman of leisure, girl, right or wrong
And though my dream has come and gone
There's plenty more where those came from

Lowell George,"I've had bad dreams too many times,
To think that they don't mean much any more.
Fine times have gone and left my sad home,
Friends who once cared just walk out my door.

[Chorus]
Love has no pride when I call out your name.
Love has no pride when there's no one left to blame.
I'd give anything to see you again.

I've been alone too many nights
To think that you could come back again.
But I've heard you talk: ""she's crazy to stay.""
But this love hurts me so, I don't care what you say.

[Chorus]

If I could buy your love, I'd truly try my friend.
And if I could pray, my prayer would never end.
But if you want me to beg, I'll fall down on my knees;
Asking for you to come back
I'd be pleading for you to come back
Beggin' for you to come back to me.

Won't put himself above me
Who can love me like a man

But you got to know how,
You can make me cry, you can make me sigh,
But you got to know how,
You can make me do like this, you can make me do like that,
Woh, baby, but you got to know how.

Once a pal of mine stole a guy of mine,
But I got him back, now,
It's the same old song, she couldn't keep him long,
'Cause she didn't know how.
Well, I love my man, I make him holler,
Woh, my,
Yessir, I really know how.

Technique ain't tough, if you care enough,
You can learn to know how,
I might drop a hint how to strike my flint
If you yearn to know how,
Well, don't tell me about the life you led,
Don't try to drink me into bed,
No, baby, no, that ain't the way how.

You got to take your time, you know it ain't no crime
If it lasts all night.
I think you'll be ideal when you begin to feel
That you're doin' right.

When you love me right, you hear me holler,
Woh, my,
Yessir, when you really know how.

(instrumental break)

And if you stay with me, who knows how it will be
When we finally know how,
We'll get a house in town, no need to move around
When we really know how,
Well, there's tricks that I don't even know,
Ones we'll make up as we go.
Woh, mister, when we really know how.
Yes, mister, when we really know how.

We will get by

In the eye of a hurricane
We cast our fates
On seas of indifference

But all along the shoreline

And the promise will survive

And barricades the heart

When there's not enough
In the glass that appears to be half full
But I can't fill it up

But I can't fill it up

And I've worried a lot about where I'll be

Di un bambino intelligente con un’ottima pagella
Si sente insignificante come la particella
Di sodio in quella vecchia pubblicità di merda
Il ragazzo c’ha un amico, è l’unico di cui si fida
L’amico è un tipo strano, ha una forma di apatia
Hanno una passione in comune, quella di odiare la vita
Di amare i film d’autore, gli aereoplani e la poesia

Scherzi, sogni, odio, orgasmi
Organi, cemento, armi

Ricordi quando il dolore noi non riuscivamo a esprimerlo?

Le canne sopra una panchina, assenti, in preda a piccoli problemi
Oppure presi da un’intesa folle e risate sguaiate
A tredici anni a Trastevere ubriachi scalzi
Salto sul muro, il calcio volante di Matrix

E l’ambizione si misura in base alla cultura

Mezzanotte e zero zero, esprimi un desiderio

Mi piace perché è d’oro e troneggia sopra il duomo
Poi mi sconvolgo e penso che la mia vita
È bella solo nell’idea di ciò che credi che sono
Ma io vorrei salvare quei momenti
Tirare su dei tempi che col tempo tu contempli
Catturare i frammenti belli e poi farci un mosaico
Psycho dramma, vivo la boheme dell’arte che osanna solo i talenti, ah

Stare da soli è bello ma è una cosa strana
Nel mio lavoro l’amicizia è una nota stonata

Quanto è carino, quando lo vede si bagna
Ma Nico esce con una della loro classe

Ho messo la mano su una lametta da barba
Mi sono chiesta che prova una ragazza che si taglia?”

Pensa che è una stupida e che non l’ha mai capita, lei
Lei soffre troppo ma fuori fa meno male
Ha bisogno di tagliarsi, vuole sentirsi reale

Un po’ le sembra di cadere
Un po’ le sembra di vedere Agnese, la sua amica del cuore

Pensa che fortuna esserle amica

Prima ero un fuoco acceso nel polo a gennaio

La notte dopo i concerti ti penso fino al mattino
Però durante il giorno io vivo per queste canzoni
E tu sembri cercare il punto in cui si perdono i miei occhi
E vorrei portarti in tourneè con i timbri dei privè
E un parrucchiere nello staff venuto solo per te
Ma a volte diventi cupa, la regina delle tenebre
E hai paura che una fan rubi un pezzo di me
So che è impossibile, io non cambierò per niente al mondo
E ciò che provo adesso è indescrivibile
Quel sogno irraggiungibile adesso è nel mirino
E forse neanche tu capisci quanto è grande il mio obiettivo
Non essere cattivo, noi non possiamo finire
Baby forse ormai è tardi, parto in tour in aprile
E tu che ascolti la canzone e ti piacciono i testi
Se lo sai rispondi ""nei miei panni che faresti, eh?""

Solo scrivendo riesco a dirti: ti voglio bene davvero

A me non piace nulla tranne vendetta e successo
E so che non c’è nulla di nobile in questo
Quindi tu fai qualcosa di importante, che aiuti le persone
Perché io questa volta non ci riesco
Domani ci svegliamo presto, tipo quando vai a scuola
Scuola non serve a niente ma la vita è una scuola
Per me sei grande quindi datti da fare
Non c’è niente di più stupido di sognare

Io so che a sedici anni sei incazzato
Che anche mamma e papà ti sembran nemici
Io lo so che sei diverso dai tuoi amici
Perché pensi più di loro e ti senti un emarginato
Io lo so che a scuola ti senti sprecato
Che a volte sei malinconico e vedi tutto sfuocato
Che tieni le cose dentro e poi non ti sei mai sfogato
Che i più intelligenti soffrono e a volte è un dono ingrato
Ma il mondo è di quelli come me e te
Sei un farfalla pronta a uscire dal suo guscio
E quando prenderai il volo io sarò con te, si
Quando prenderai il volo io sarò con te

Per me sei grande quindi datti da fare
Non c’è niente di più stupido di sognare

Tu puoi dire ciò che vuoi, è il bello di essere intelligente
E se gira male, c’è sempre un lato divertente
Le ragazze sono belle ma non fotterti la mente
Ricorda che per ogni Eva ci sarà un serpente
E non farti cambiare mai o condizionare dal tuo ambiente
Mamma e papà ci hanno insegnato a pensare liberamente
Può sembrare banale ma fidati non lo è per niente
Qua la religione insegna a pensare poco profondamente

A me non piace nulla tranne vendetta e successo

Lowlow,"Questa è per la nostra terribile educazione
Per ogni notte senza direzione
Per ogni strega che voleva il mio cuore
Ma io un cuore non ce l’ho, ce lo avete di Rick Owens?
Voglio che tu sappia questa è senza strategia
Questa cosa non è né una canzone né una poesia
L’ho scritta per tutti voi ma direi una bugia
Se dicessi che davvero mi manca casa mia
E a volte sei così finto, a volte ti sento vicino
Altre volte ti domandi quando finisce il mio ego
Sapessi quanto male ho fatto al mio migliore amico
Io dentro sono un killer e non so guardarmi indietro
E i bravi ragazzi dormono sereni
Ma alle ragazze piacciamo noi coi problemi
E la mia idea di vissero felici e contenti
Sono io che dormo solo con una borsa di contanti

E a mia mamma non piaci, sei solo un’egoista
Una primadonna fuorviata che gioca a fare l’artista
I miei mi hanno viziato, non c’è che dire
Ma ho cambiato il mio destino soltanto scrivendo rime

Promettimi che un giorno scrivi un pezzo preso bene
Promettimi che un giorno scrivi un pezzo preso bene
Promettimi che per una volta tu scegli il bene
Prometti che in un’altra vita ci vogliamo bene
Promettimi che tu e mia sorella uscirete insieme
Prometti che non tocchi la coca, zio, non fa bene
Perché tutti gli artisti sono persone fragili
E dio benedica le ragazze facili

La donna della mia vita, ti giuro, m’ha rimbalzato
Né il mio swag né tutto questo sfoggiare mi hanno salvato
Ho firmato con la Sugar, giuro, non sono arrabbiato
Spero che lei prenda il mio disco e lo regali al fidanzato
E se ti dicessi che io ho rinunciato alla felicità
Non per la notorietà, ma per essere il migliore
Il re del rap italiano, perché fare lo scrittore era il sogno di papà
E a volte sei così bella, a volte resto indifferente
A volte siamo stelle, a volte ragazzi normali
E a volte sei così bella, a volte resto indifferente
Abbiamo solo sogni e vaffanculo agli ideali
Queste sono le ultime, ho l’ansia da prestazione
Ho scritto tutto questo disco in preda all’emozione
Neanche il mio talento supera la mia ambizione
Il mio rap resurrezione, questa è la mia redenzione

E a mia mamma non piaci, sei solo un’egoista
Una primadonna fuorviata che gioca a fare l’artista

Voglio dire una cosa e spero non sia troppo lunga
“La verità è che la musica non ha mai salvato nessuno
Tantomeno un uomo che stava per prendere fuoco ma, devo dire
Devo ammettere che la musica e l’arte mi hanno permesso di
Diventare la persona che sognavo di essere da ragazzino”

A scuola parlava poco, io lo trovavo fico
Una mattina andavo in banca insieme a mamma
E ho visto Nico entrare e calarsi il passamontagna
“Buongiorno gente, questa è una rapina
Io sono l’ultima persona che vedrete nella vita
A meno che non vi mettete faccia a terra a pecorina
E sarà tutto rapido e indolore come una sveltina
Lasciate i portafogli a terra
Insieme a oro e collanine, io amo tutta quella merda
E se qualcuno si crede un eroe o un cavaliere jedi
Lo farò strisciare per tutta la vita come un millepiedi
Adesso passerò lentamente, avete visto? 
Fate i bravi cagnolini, non succede niente
Siete ubbidienti, voi piccoli bastardi
Chi ha i soldi e non li usa è un ladro, lo diceva Ghandi
Adesso io voglio parlare con il direttore! Sisisisisi voglio parlare con lui
A meno che non voglia lasciare il figlio da solo, solo
Con la povera moglie a piangere con lui
Salve direttore, io mi chiamo Nico
È un piacere incontrare la gente che fa il suo impiego
Ci tenevo a dirle che lei mi fa proprio schifo
E che sua figlia è una cagna, andrebbe bene con un cieco
Ma parliamo d’affari, sì, parliamo d’affari
Tu ora sei il mio schiavo, obbedisci o sparo
Se torni senza aver svuotato le fottute casse
Ti salta testa e ci faccio la rovesciata di Van Basten""

Ho scelto il male perché il bene era banale

Vuoi vedere il video di un bambino bullizzato online?
Vuoi sapere che pensavano quelli di Columbine?
Vuoi sapere? Non vuoi sapere, ma io parlo
Sei fortunato, non mi pagano per farlo
Io sono un tarlo, un grillo parlante armato
E adesso saluta i tuoi amici abbronzati di Montecarlo
Vuoi sapere perché la gente non ha più idee?
È perché loro vogliono così
E lo sai qual è la cosa divertente?
È che io parlo di loro, la domanda è “loro chi?”
Perché sono qui? Per provare la violenza
Sulla tua pelle, perché la civiltà è decadenza
E questo è solo un atto di libertà intellettuale
Libertà è dire alla gente ciò che non vuole ascoltare
E prima di entrare, ho chiamato le guardie
Devo fare tutto da solo, anche una sparatoria
E c’hai presente quel frocetto di Andy Warhol?
Quindici minuti e passiamo alla storia!”

Dio proteggi i miei nemici che ne hanno bisogno
Ogni giorno sarò più grande, non fermare il sogno
Dammi solo la forza di rubare un'iride
Perché chi è vincente ora sembrerà invincibile
Ho fatto questo disco solo per mangiarvi in faccia
E il mio nome è così grande che anche dirlo è una minaccia
Lancio l’oro nell acqua e fanculo la fama
Muoio amando il sistema ma anche il sistema mi ama

This is only for the heathens
Hold until the souls who need redeeming from the demons
Still ain't folded when it's freezing
There ain't no-one to believe in
I'm on that man side
Damn right, doing it myself from a landslide
Standby, didn't need no help from no damn guy
Man by, I've been making waves all my damn life
Clam might, step to my letter and I stand by it
Try it, we ain't holding back if it backfires
Lax, not the ones who carry crack 'til they're back tired
Thought they'd make a mil 'til it transpired

I ain't like them damn liars
Uh, I'm saying I ain't like them damn liars
Trust, told him I ain't like them damn liars

So keep your mouth closed shut
Eyes wide open when that doubt rose up
'Cause if that drought shows nothing but the clouds hold nothing but the sound, 
I'll be running 'til the ground open up
'Cause the best don't change
Clinging to that whole one
My mother said there's no love until you show some
So I showed love and got nothing, now there's no-one
You wonder why I couldn't keep in tow, son
I wonder why my dad didn't want me
Ex didn't need me
Half of them left, and the rest finna breeze me
Gets blessed 'til I second guess rest 'til it freeze me
There's nothing to believe in, believe me

Little bit of life after death
Scatter my ashes when it's my time to rest
With the lines I'm obsessed
Rhymes I posses
Can't deny, seen the biggest guys cry to confess in a breath
Fresh death passin' the chest
Unimpressed with the sess 
Left scars in the flesh
He's the best
Worst kept spar in the jest
Saying star never bar
Too far from the nest

So I never left and never thought about doing so
I to-and-fro from that prime time to a home
You see, I'm doing those nights I shoulda known better like whatever 
Still my bredda's say I'm too involved
But who would know what the family first is
'Til you dream, see 3 family hearses
Worst is, wanted me to speak at the service
So I penned a couple bars didn't need to rehearse it",The Isle of Arran,
Loyle Carner,"Only say it if you'll mean it in the morning
To me it seems a little more important
To see if she be breezy with that easiness of Autumn
Before we get all caught up in the calling
But the way that I was falling back in '09
Fidget but feeling it was go time
Sitting with my missus didn't show signs
Lines that were mine
Kissing on that cold spine
Love was all and hopeless 'fore I focused on that co-sign
Sitting with my bro Kleff
Listening to Mos Def
Waiting on a day's pay
Promising to post cheques
But didn't have a bigger brother who would know best
Melting on the inside
Trying not to show stress
But your choice
It was only your voice that could sooth me and save
'Til I'm showing your boys how to glow
Others grow
Blowing your noise
So I stop and I thank you for showing those joys

'Cause they were saying I'm the lucky one
'Cause I was swaying with the change
Feeling ashamed when the money comes
But I've been waiting here for days
Trust
And they would say when the others run
That she'd be waiting in the rain
Can't complain what the others done
I'll be the lucky one

Wish I could love you like I know I should
Waiting for better, for forever while we're growing good
Feel like that young spun
Living off my mum
Saying it wouldn't be fun
But it's dumb, 'cause I know it would
Hoping to show it like the growing of the sunsets
One guess, waiting for the day that we were undressed
And say the days seemed to fade as the fun gets
Few and far between
Coming clean
Coming one chest
Pressed
Like apple in the cider she was sipping
We were drunk and she would listen
Longing for the later when you shaded her with kissing
And you coloured all her numbers
With the love that you've been missing
Now you sit indifferent
Crippled in the heat
A little brittle from the evils that you speak
You see it deep
Still you're wishing underneath in the sheet
But you need to keep it sweet

'Cause they were saying I'm the lucky one
'Cause I was swaying with the change
Feeling ashamed when the money comes
But I've been waiting here for days

Mother told me to bring some flowers, but I was running late
Didn't wanna rush it, bought suttin' safe
Shit, left it on the train in the fucking rain
Strange, I'd do it all the same just to come again
The pain, I know your girl's being strong for you
Telling me the world ain't long for you
I'm tryna make her laugh any way I can
Press her head in to my hands but I'm feeling quite responsible
So I'ma keep her safe don't you worry 'bout it
Keep that smile on her face 'til the sun ain't clouded
This ain't nothing to replace all the love that's shrouded
But I can see it on your face you'd be fucking proud
And everybody else is too
'Cause your Eliza's a reflection of you
So when you're resting in the setting to soothe remember every single blessing is true

And so I'm saying everybody else is, too
'Cause little Harvey's a reflection of you
I'm saying everything you say rings true

Living in this hurry, only worry is my next breath

'Til you rest where your breddas left wishing you were next
But the best don't, fade
Flicker where the flame blows
The circle still be tighter than some canerows
I feel the pain, never worry if the pain shows
Maybe only reason I be feeling like I paint those images that fit

When every jungle animal is on a feeding frenzy
Fear loathing on this helter skelter
When all we really need is food, clothing and shelter
Played the hand they dealt ya down 'til the last card
You claim king but only jokers have the last laugh
So when alarm bells ring we don't do a thing
But sing, it's sink or swim and the tide is in
Every night is a title bid
You gotta float when you're the butterfly that they're tryna pimp
And pack a sting for those buzzing 'round your honeybee

Pumping product from this basement trying to make a statement

Remain determined 'cause the work is being put in
I'm aware of what I'm cooking and the people overlooking
Mastering this recipe before we hand it out
But still living hand-to-mouth
Thought I had it figured out ,what a setback
That time is money that I'll never get back
And yeah I get that but listen if that
No time to dwell, 'cause only time will tell if it works
Flipping verses, filling purses is a gift and a curse
And so I, live for the better and I learn from the worst
I'm burning earnings will curve

Still don't change nothing
Same bluffing
Same blame with the same something
Same pain
Spelt her name in the same substance
Shame saying it ain't the same when the rains coming

Colder for the evening

They don't fade, I ain't ashamed
Watch us fall from Mars
Cos it's the fallen parts and all the dust settles
And we all call on ours fast as we pluck petals
We let the love pour into our brain
Another day doing more to maintain
Saying finally those tears in my mother's eyes
Tears from the other side
Tears of joy, her little boy's got his mother's pride
You don't know nothing 'bout the rain 'til you come inside
And watch it trickle past the pane as the summer rise

Becoming pressures

They make me want to drift away

I wasn't running from the beast, I was running from myself
Running out of street, she was worried 'bout my health
Wasn't worried it was beef
Wasn't worried it was girls
She was worried it was me and my mother couldn't tell
Something bigger than the world
For me and Ryan
Now he could see that I've been crying
Tell a little lie and say there's something in my eye
And from the second he could see that I've been lying
He would think I wasn't trying
Telling him, look honestly I'm dying
To be the bigger man, the one that you're relying on
I keep it strong
So I tell another lie 'cause it's the only way to keep me from denying
So I tell him brother listen
Listen, when the sun don't glisten
All the days turn grey and the love goes missing
Hate won't fade and the front row hissing
You're the only one that keeps my heart wishing

He was a scribble of boy
All hair and mischief
A two-foot tale of trouble
The bee's knees
A cartwheeling chatterbox of tricks
Completely fearless
I had to carry a first aid kit
My band-aid boy
I had my heart in my mouth wherever we went
He'd do backflips into the pool when he was tiny
And the lifeguards would get all stressed out
He was a proper Mowgli
He embraced everything
Took things apart to see what made them tick
Such busy fingers
He would empty sugar packets onto the tables at restaurants to draw pictures in
He used to draw on anything
Fantastical creatures with ferocious fangs
And now he draws with words and I find lyrics on my till receipts and bills
He was never still and barely slept so neither did I
I could never understand how he could watch TV upside down while kicking a ball
His eyes shone with wonder
Music flowed through him like a current
He'd upend a stool to use as a microphone
Singing away for his grandparents
He turned the world upside down and we're richer for it
He was and is a compete joy
The world is his

Deep cocoon, like you're digging in crates
Already done with your digging, so your digging is bait

Not the greatest - but gimme space kid, I’m set to make it

Rocking hi-hats and big kicks that are the latest trend

Bredders putting cheddar over lyrics
Then diminish any vision when they clear it

Moving like they’re mannequins
Dressed by other brothers
Hiding under covers with mothers be panicking
Rambling
Gassing like they’re Anakin
But red and blue lights are out of sight
On the mic - stop damaging
Your honour and your pride
I, goner from the side
Never dippin' from the rhythm
Flow specific when I rhyme
Sometime tell the flack and back, a slap
To any cracker jack who be slacking his mac
I’m on the track and in my prime

Time if you chose it
Keep your spine straighter then a blind homophobic
Ease your mind - if you hold it

Loyle Carner,"Give me your guts, deliver them up
It was half-past nothing and the river was blood
The city shrugged, we closed our eyes, stepped back into our huts
As if it meant nothing to us

Come on, give me your palm and a bucket of Khan
Hold me closer on the sofas sleeping under your arm
They say that slumber will harm
But I am under your charm
So keep it going never know when we'll be sober to start

Give me them thundering darks
Give me them hungers that've been coming apart so long
It's a wonder that we still want to dance
But here we are in the humbling dark
Throwing shapes while the hunters advance

Come on, give me your chance
Where the eyes might find
Opposition left her wishing she was mine all mine
And not first night until the eyes go blind
We're entwined

Oh, but in the morning they all leave us behind

Come on, give me your guts, man, deliver them up
You say you're searching for something but the sympathy's stuck
So come on, give me your guts, man, deliver them up
There's no villainy big enough that you can't kill it with love
Come on, give me your guts - deliver them up
You know you're looking above, but you're living for love
Come on, give me your guts, man deliver them up
Skimming the surface but it isn't enough
No, it isn't enough

Give me a smile let me kick it around
It was something I found in the road
The night's coming down
He gives like a toad
He's just looking for a princess to love him
But all the princesses think he's just disgusting
You can beat him up but can't budge him
I was in Budgens, picking up a can with my cousin
And I saw him bent double by the dustbins
Retching up a puddle of guts, people
Wanted to help but they couldn't bear touch him
The fat prince rolled over, too much
Look, you can kick him down but can't crush him
You can take him home but can't trust him
His heart is a book, his armour is crooked
His arms are the hooks in the mouth of a mermaid he's been harvesting
Shook dry by barbarous lips
He sees the picture but he's hardly a part of it
He's starting to slip

Trust, for him it's harder than it looks
They're holding those riddles
Up in the middle
While others hide in their books
Every cranny every nook
Backing up what they could
Storming alleys in their valleys happy with what they took
From what they're given
Locks their living
Holding dogs they're sniffing
Floorboards lifting up
In every flat they're slotting all the difficult decisions
He's used to it
Bruises for proof of it
Fuses shot he didn't use until his uses
Until he's blot where Gruesomes live
Truth of it
Abusive kid
Simply wanted shoes to fit
His hands would understand there's a grand if you move this shit
Sniffing white powder
Burning through the light hours
Getting light, losers getting tight
Couldn't lose his grip
Soon he did, slipped and slept where the kid was kept
Took the deepest breath of his ex, said

""I'm deep in debt""

Steep regret, cos he died like his brother
When all he wanted to do was provide for his mother

So, give me your guts, man, deliver them up
There's more to the world than the things you can touch
Give me your guts, man, deliver them up
Funny feeling in your lungs
But the sympathy's strung
So come on, give me your guts, man, deliver them up
Now I'm trying to go the distance but I keep getting stuck
Man, give me your guts, come, deliver them up
You sit, sipping the wisdom till you're feeling the calm

Give me a reason, the reason is long gone
Even the feeling I want one is wrong
And every evening when I feel it come on
I start to laugh, start singing the song

Singing the song, look give me a reason
The reason is long gone
And even the feeling that I want one is wrong
And every evening when I feel it come on
I start to laugh, start singing the song, give me your guts
Come on deliver (come on deliver) them up
Give me your guts, man, deliver them up",Guts,2016

Never consumed by the money
But selling dro in the park
Became a main habit of his, bagging the piff
Corner copy is copying the man he was blacker than piff
It wasn't simple

Simpler than the previous maturity
Was lacking it
He was never mischievous
Devious was closer
Only relevant if leaving us
He was too afraid so he stayed for us to believe in trust

Honesty was the commodity he never possessed
Never the less
Manipulate a woman beating his chest
Reaping his stress
Sneaking a breath
We can assess
Hear the pitter patter listen and latter
Weeping to death

Without a shoulder to cry on
No one left to rely on
He was followed by some men in black
Like the belt of Orion
In the report
Said he was caught dead in the snort
And was shredded
He never even embedded the thought

Wondering if I open up or keep concealing
I ain't try to be demeaning
It seems
Thought you knew dis
I don't really do dis
Moving like a Judas
Talking all that talk
But ain't no time for acting foolish
When you ask of all the brothers saying ""true dis""
I might just jump on this for free
Jumping on them freestyle
I've been well
Moving brain, senile
It's sole sunsets
Beautiful is one guess
One morning afternoon in that sun dress
Summer flies by
Every morning, I'm still yawning
Same conversation, never boring
(Yo, she texted you, swear? Nah it's Tomen, ah for fuck's sake)

I know that these days are feeling cold
My love could take her home
As if we never knew
I was too young for you

Ay, and then you say you ain't about guys
Ay, especially brothers from the south side
But been about mine
Ever since the drought now
You and me been living on this cloud nine
Saying it's about time
Stunting, front light
Nothing will change until it drains
Ain't noting the same
'Cause you become like the blood in my veins
Saying I'm way too young
To be stuck on the rain
But still it's peak
Weeks 'til I figured out you played keys
Eighteen, you been listening to Jay Dee
Blaming the bait trees
Telling me you hate these
G's but didn't need me telling you they ain't me
Because they ain't me, they ain't me
Don't need to know about the colours that they paint me
I've been too busy getting dizzy off that JD
Dreaming of the places you could take me, so now I'm sayin'

I know that these days are feeling cold
My love could take her home
As if we never knew
I was too young for you",Damselfly,2017
Loyle Carner,"I was sat up on the train
Staring out the window at the rain (aye)
I heard this little lady must've felt the pain
Ask her mum if the blazing sun'll ever shine again
I felt ashamed, feel the same not her mother, though
Nah, started to laugh got her son involved (aye)
Mention the past like a running joke
And told her without all the rain there's no stuntin' growth
Close, ah, to everything and nothing, picture past the honeymoon and bluffing
Where the wooden spoon is only cuffing
Shorter the discussion but the roots can't manoeuvre out of nothing
I've been suffering these dreamy days (ah)
Remedy and lust don't hold any memories of us
Rather hold you everyday until the memories are dust
Yo, we only caught the train cause you know I hate the bus
Never get enough

Born and raised
Made attempts to crawl away
Find a way to exist and hide your face, some relate
Leave everything in yesterday

They ask about the bible I was reading
Told them that the title was misleading, labelled it jerusalem
But really it's for cooking middle eastern
I could see your mind was changing with the seasons, shady for a reason (ah)
They will start decreasing, leaving like the orange in the evening
It was creeping through the clouds but now I'm proud to see the images releasing
I just wish the little lady could've seen it but she was dreaming (ah)
Reckon she's standing with her mum, saying to her
""Look, mother, here's the sun"", rooted in the moment 'til the memories are done
So I sit and start to wonder on the woman she'll become
Wonder if I'll have a son or a daughter
Ones that I brought up never strong, never telling me to run
Never tried to find a sum, tryna get it done
Yo, I wonder if she'll ever be as clever as her mum, one

Born and raised
Made attempts to crawl away
Find a way to exist and hide your face, some relate

""Man, we can turn back in a second
So remember what I'm tryna show you

So remember it's love, everybody
And I'm gonna look for life, for my time

Blew the world apart
You handed me the dagger
Aimed towards your heart

Your eyes were televisions
High above the static

Covered it with chalk
Lined our mouths with alcohol
Talked about the war that we were winning

The soldier boys were singing
And praying for an intermission

early one Sunday morning
I woke to see my baby missing from bed (yes I did, yes I did)
And lying there on her pillow
It was a letter and it read (ooh girl yeah yeah)
We just don't talk like we used to
We just don't do things we used to do, no no
So I decided to just move on

What about our love
What about our joy
What about our dear family
Ooh, what about me

as I read on it just brought me down
And I questioned myself like where when how
She could leave me this way
She didn't fuss or complain
And I'm thinking she's fine
But she knew all the time
She would leave us behind
Broke that promise she lied
Now my kids teary eyed
Girl you could have compromised

You didn't show a sign
You weren't happy girl
Now you crushed our world
And you let go everything

Bring me pine logs hither.

And the bitter weather.

And the wind blows stronger.

I can go no longer. 
Ark my footsteps my good page,
Tread thou in them boldly:
Thou shalt find the winter's rage
Freeze thy blood less coldly.

Where the snow lay dented.

Lt. Colonel Duncan Beat,"Once in royal David's city 
Stood a lowly cattle-shed 
Where a mother laid her baby 
In a manger for His bed
Mary was that mother mild 
Jesus Christ her little child

He came down to earth from heaven
Who is God and Lord of all
And His shelter was a stable
And His cradle was a stall
With the poor, and mean, and lowly
Lived on earth our Savior holy

Jesus is our childhood's pattern
Day by day like us He grew
He was little, weak, and helpless
Tears and smiles, like us, He knew
And He feeleth for our sadness
And He shareth in our gladness 

And our eyes at last shall see Him
Through His own redeeming love 
For that Child so dear and gentle 
Is our Lord in heav'n above 
And He leads His children on 
To the place where He is gone",Once in Royal David's City,2002

This day breaking for you
Give birth again
To the dream

Women, children, men
Take it into the palms of your hands
Mold it into the shape of your most
Private need, sculpt it into

The image of your most public self
Lift up your hearts

For new beginnings

Do not be wedded forever
To fear, yoked eternally
To brutishness

Offering you space to place
New steps of change

Once again you feel like the brothers know
Once again, back is the incredible
The rhyme animal
The unforgetable

First friends, then lovers, undercovers, I plush flats
You copped the bezels that match

Let me catch you out cheatin', I'mma cut off your dick

When I needed money, you lent

I'll be your lover and friend
You did your dirt then I grew it
I stayed there helpin' you through it
I f***ed up too and you knew it

Many times I thought that you blew it
But then you'd always make it right with me
No fight with me, forever kept it tight with me
Sometimes you ditched the fellas 

Just to come and ride with me
Then stripped me down, licked me up, every night with me
You never made me feel I owed you for the deeds that you done
Re-payed you with my loyalty, promised to give you a son

Can't nothin' come between us ever boy

Mirarte entre tanta gente
Saber que no eres para mi
Saber que no me perteneces

Tal vez no ha sido suficiente
Robarme el corazón pues sé
Que nada dura para siempre

yo sólo veo en ti
El mas perfecto error de la creación

enamorarme de ti
Inevitable sufrir
Es traicionar de nuevo al corazón porque tu why yo
Ya no podemos seguir
Porque en mi vida ya no hay dolor
Enamorarme de ti yo sé
Fue mi gran error

si pudiera cambiar al tiempo
Cambiaria lo que ahora siento
Desearia no estar asi
Dejar todo por un momento
Why tal vez completar quien soy

Ni matar este sentimiento

Sabes bien que te di lo que soy
Why tu amor es limosna why dolor
Yo de ti fui un amante sin amor
Se acabo no me pidas perdón

Mírate, mira q mal te ves
Why mírame, que mi culpa no es
Deja de atormentarme al corazón
Lárgate que ya no te quiero ver

No hay nadie en este mundo que me hiciera tanto daño
Fui tonto no lo niego me llegaste a convencer
Why vienes why me mientes mientras vamos de la mano
Seguro estas pensando que me tienes a tus pies

Maldita estupidez

Yo quise hacerte feliz
Pero el problema es que no quieres ser feliz
Se me olvido a mi también que yo también quería serlo
Why lo lamento no vuelvo a caer

No diré que no habrá nadie mejor que yo
Si los hay
Pero es que dudo que alguien crea en ti como yo
Como te pude aguantar

Hoy diré que me arrepentí
De vivir el tiempo junto a ti
Tal vez yo solo te imagine
La verdad es que yo nunca te mire

Ojala aprendas a distinguir
Entre el amor, el ego, el odio why la pasión
Te olvide solo por que te odie
Solo fue una pinche obsesión

Lo peor de todo es que sabes perfecto que eres mala
Why andas presumiéndole a la gente que eres fiel
No digas que me extrañas por que no te creo nada
Yo se que tu actitud es tu mas grande estupidez

Maldita estupidez

Yo quise hacerte feliz
Pero el problemas es que no quieres ser feliz
Se me olvido, se me olvido a mi también que
Yo también quería serlo why lo lamento no vuelvo a caer

Yo también quería serlo why lo prometo no vuelvo a caer

Nunca me pudiste dar

Lu,"Maria, you're still wild and restless
And I can just see ya ridin' in a rodeo
You might even make it down to Texas
Or you might head out west to New Mexico

So pack up all of your belongings
A pick-up will take you where you want to go
You can ride out when you hear mountains calling
Out to Canada or the canyons of Colorado

New York City was always your home
But in your heart you know you were born to roam
And you're gonna leave as soon as you get the money
After you sell everything you own

Maria, is loneliness a virtue
Or does it steal you blind and leave you split apart
Maria, can you give me an answer
Are the songs we sing worth the broken heart

The highway has always been your lover
And someday you may know his name
Wherever you stay it wouldn't really matter
'Cause all those cities start to look the same

Some folks will try to take your heart away
And just when you think you've really got it made
You wake up and find madness in the morning
But damn the pain and damn those restless days
Damn the pain and damn those restless days",María,2006

no lo pienses demasiado o quizá vas a perderme,

tu lástima me ofende mejor déjame tu odio

que sólo se odia lo amado,

que me recuerdes con honor no como un descorazonado

así pierdes tú why lo gano yo,

why no pierdo más mi tiempo me has dejado ir sin saber

que pude haber sido yo

que pudiste haber sido tu.


¿Y quién crees que perdió? ¿quién te crees que soy yo?

soy todo lo que siempre extrañarás haber sabido,

cuando descubras que el único trago amargo

fue el de tu dulce adiós.


Te conocía más mi imaginación que mis sentidos

me enamoré de una idea no de una realidad

la obsesión por la ilusión de no estar tan encerrado

de los niveles del amor del cual yo no conozco nada

no es que viva para mi pero aún no ha habido nadie

que atormente mi pasión hasta dejarme sin aire

que apacigue mi dolor por el cansancio de buscarte

que impaciente la adicción a besar why ser besado

que reviente la reacción para amar why ser amado.


Que no serás tú, quien podra extasiarme

seguiré buscando quien me ame why quien me deje amarle,

es fácil me molesta la gente como tu

que complica siempre el modo why no valora pronto todo,

se cierra el libro ya aún antes de empezar

no se escribe esta historia why ya jamás se escribirá,

me dejaste ir sin saber

que pude que soy why que siempre habré sido yo

why nunca fuiste tú.

I love my baby like a school boy loves his pie
Like a Kentucky colonel loves his mint 'n rye
I love my man till the day I die",St. Louis Blues,2000
Lu Watters,"And now the purple dusk of twilight time
Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb
Always reminding me that we're apart
You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms
The nightingale 
Tells his fairytale
Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain
My stardust melody
The memory of love's refrain.",Stardust,2000
Lu Watters & the Yerba Buena Jazz Band,"How come you do me like you do do do?
How come you do me like you do?
Why do you try to make me feel so blue?
I've done nothing to you.
Do me right or else just let me be.
'Cause I can beat you doing what you're doing to me.
How come you do me like you do do do?
How come you do me like you do?

Lu Watters & the Yerba Buena Jazz Band,"I hate to see that evening sun go down
I hate to see that evening sun go down
Cause my baby, he's gone left this town

Feelin' tomorrow like I feel today
If I'm feelin' tomorrow like I feel today
I'll pack my truck and make my give-a-way

St. Louis woman with her diamond ring
Pulls that man around by her, if it wasn't for her and her
That man I love would have gone nowhere, nowhere

I got the St. Louis blues, blues as I can be
That man's got a heart like a rock cast in the sea
Or else he wouldn't have gone so far from me

I love my baby like a school boy loves his pie
Like a Kentucky colonel loves his mint 'n rye
I love my man till the day I die",St. Louis Blues,1994

Where's that tiger! Where's that tiger!
Hold that tiger! Hold that tiger ! Hold that tiger!

Where oh where can he be?

Lu Watters & the Yerba Buena Jazz Band,"It was down by old Joe's barroom, on the corner of the square
They were serving drinks as usual, and the usual crowd was there
On my left stood Big Joe McKennedy, and his eyes were bloodshot red
And he turned his face to the people, these were the very words he said

I was down to St. James infirmary, I saw my baby there
She was stretched out on a long white table, 
So sweet, cool and so fair

Let her go, let her go, God bless her
Wherever she may be
She may search this whole wide world over
Never find a sweeter man as me

When I die please bury me in my high top Stetson hat
Put a twenty dollar gold piece on my watch chain
The gang'll know I died standing pat

Let her go, let her go God bless her
Wherever she may be
She may search this wide world over
Never find a sweeter man as me

I want six crapshooters to be my pallbearers
Three pretty women to sing a song
Stick a jazz band on my hearse wagon
Raise hell as I stroll along

Let her go Let her go
God bless her
Wherever she may be
She may search this whole wide
World over
She'll never find a sweeter
Man as me",St. James Infirmary,2002
Lu Watters & the Yerba Buena Jazz Band,"Sunny, yesterday my life was filled with rain
Sunny, you smiled at me and really eased the pain

Oh, the dark days are done and the bright days are here
My sunny one shines so sincere
Oh, Sunny one so true, I love you

Sunny, thank you for the sunshine bouquet
Sunny, thank you for the love you've brought my way

You gave to me your all and all
Now I feel ten feet tall
Oh, Sunny one so true, I love you

Sunny, thank you for the truth you've let me see
Sunny, thank you for the facts from A to Z

My life was torn like wind-blown sand
Then a rock was formed when we held hands
Sunny one so true, I love you

Sunny, thank you for that smile upon your face
Sunny, thank you for that gleam that flows with grace

You're my spark of nature's fire
You're my sweet complete desire
Sunny one so true, I love you",Tin Roof Blues,2002
Lu Watters & the Yerba Buena Jazz Band,"This town is full of guys
Who think they're mighty wise,
Just because they know a thing or two.
You see them every day
Walkin' up and down Broadway,
Telling of the wonders they can do.
There's con men and there's boosters,
Card sharks and crap-shooters.
They congregate around the Metropole.
They wear fancy ties and laces,
But where do they get their aces?
They all have got an ace down in the hole!

Some of them write to the old folks for coin,
And that is their ace in the hole,
And others have friends on the old Tenderloin;
That's their old ace in the hole.

They'll tell you of trips that they're going to take
From Florida to the North Pole.
The fact is, their name would be mud,
Like a chump playing stud,
If they lost that old ace down in the hole!",Ace in the Hole,2008
