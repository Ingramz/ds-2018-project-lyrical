Can't find whatever we lost

But listen woman, everything must change
It's time you found yourself some other fool you can blame
You had me figured as the spineless one
Who'd be there waiting when you'd had your fun
But now's the time I feel I should be cool
What a shame, what a shame

Who gets the love that we no longer share?
Who gets to hold you close when I'm not there?
Whose heart is filling up, I'm asking you
Who gets the love?

So many times you said I made you cry
That's not the truth it's just an alibi
And I'm not planning to be number two, won't play your game.
I've often wondered after love has gone
Where do we find the strength to carry on?
And where's that someone that our love supplies
And what's their name? What a shame.

Who gets the love that we no longer share?
Who gets to hold you close when I'm not there?
Whose heart is filling up, I'm asking you
Who gets the love?

Before we give in are we really sure
We're giving love that we don't need no more?
There ain't a chance that we might get together again, oh no

There you go again
Telling me the same mistakes I made
There you go again
Telling me the way I should have played

And tell me all I should have done

I wonder where your time has gone
Are you throwing it away

Who asked you
To prey on my feelings
Lying low in every cloud
Who asked you
I've never been the one
To give you any kind of reason
Who asked you

Who asked you
When I was still learning
To come along and put me down
Who asked you
I made it anyway
While every cloud was slowly turning
Who asked you
Who asked you

There you go again
Telling me the same mistakes I made
There you go again
Telling me the way I should have played
There never was a better way
Than living like the way I've done

The reasons now I find, conditions at the time
Did not allow for you to be

So don't you worry

Take time don't worry

And can be oh so very nice

Well, there were hundreds and hundreds of mumbling miles
Always a personal reason to cop or to smile

Slowly but surely we learnt that it wasn't a game
But it was good clean fun

Status Quo,"It's coming through a hole in the air,
From those nights in Tienanmen Square.
It's coming from the feel
That this ain't exactly real,
Or it's real, but it ain't exactly there.
From the wars against disorder,
From the sirens night and day,
From the fires of the homeless,
From the ashes of the gay,
Democracy is coming to the U.S.A. 

It's coming through a crack in the wall,
On a visionary flood of alcohol,
From the staggering account
Of the Sermon on the Mount
Which I don't pretend to understand at all.
It's coming from the silence
On the dock of the bay,
From the brave, the bold, the battered
Heart of Chevrolet:
Democracy is coming to the U.S.A. 

It's coming from the sorrow in the street,
The holy places where the races meet,
From the homicidal bitching
That goes down in every kitchen
To determine who will serve and who will eat.
From the wells of disappointment
Where the women kneel to pray
For the grace of God in the desert here
And the desert far away,
Democracy is coming to the U.S.A. 

Sail on, sail on
Oh mighty Ship of State!
To the Shores of Need
Past the Reefs of Greed
Through the Squalls of Hate
Sail on, sail on, sail on, sail on. 

It's coming to America first,
The cradle of the best and of the worst.
It's here they got the range
And the machinery for change
And it's here they got the spiritual thirst.
It's here the family's broken
And it's here the lonely say
That the heart has got to open
In a fundamental way,
Democracy is coming to the U.S.A. 

It's coming from the women and the men.

And they were burning, burning up and seeing red

Can everybody give and take a little more?
Because it's all too easy to forget
That you can fight 'til there ain't no reason left

Those soft and fuzzy sweaters, so magical to touch
To see her in that negligee is really just too much.

Rolling down the line
In the dark early morning
I heard the one-forty-nine
I was walking down the highway
Needed somewhere to go
A lady laid beside me
And she invited me home
She led me cold, tired and hungry
Down the backwater road

In a house on the corner
Looking over the track
I woke up with a fever
And a pain in my back
She was lying there beside me
My fever started to grow
Had a funny feeling
But the lady said no
The lover needs a doctor

Was I wrong to play along?
Lady was I right or lady was I wrong?

You will still have all the memories
Come alive and see the world through all the trees

Have to wrestle with your soul
Show it that you're close to understanding
Don't give up and think you're too old

I'm at the time in my life when a nigga ready to change 
I'll be dead or in jail if I don't shake this thang 
feel like I'm trapped in a prison slowly waiting to die 
it's getting harder for my people yet we don't know why 
they cuttin sistas off welfare these kids can't eat 
and it's the children like thuggish minds turned out by the street 
I couldn't see it while I was outside slangin my rocks 
servin' death to my people, commitin the ultimate evil 
robbin' and killin' my own kind, Lord forgive me 
blinded by this life of crime, God somebody hear me 
since the death of my momma, my life is filled with drama 
lost both of my kids, punished for what dirt that I did 
I can't bring em back, so I get high to forget

I keep my head up high, but I'm stuck in this game

I ain't mad at ya daddy cause you didn't come around 
I'm knowing that the times is hard, but you can make it 
You see the opportunity, you take it

Where the OG's never let go
This is somethin I had to know
Had to be real sneaky
Watched niggas that tried to creep on me
Stay away from the ones that's sheisty
That's what my momma always told me
When ya livin on the eastside, ghetto
In the ghetto, ghetto
I never knew what my life would be, ghetto
In the ghetto, ghetto
I'll show what I'm talkin bout, ghetto

I'm ready to ride, ready to roll
Ay check this mack I bet you're boyfriend aint knowin
That I'm steadily blowin your back out
Watch me track out on these niggas and bounce out on these hoes
Get at em like ""what's up trick"" you know how it goes
It's Friday night, the club is about to close
And I was lookin fabulous
So I,  got up to stretch 'bout to catch me one of these stragglers
True eastside dogs, and we barkin not simpin
Yo holmes 'bout that time to start this parking lot pimpin
I keep that thang, huh, posted in the same spot
Nothin but my khaki shorts, house shoes, boxers and my suede shine
I'm from the home of the riots
That's before the peace died but I'm still hollin out eastside

Uhh, what y'all busters gon do
When the pimps, bangers, and hustlers smash on you
It aint about who's sellin the most caine
Put us all together nigga see you run thangs
If you can't hang, stay the fuck out the kitchen
Bitch I'm ghetto fabbed out, so fuck politickin
Waitin for a chance and the shit it never happened
Time is money, and when you get it keep it clackin
All you hear is, with my two inch twist
I keep the goodyear grip, so the dubs don't slip
If you want my claims, I think you besta make a change
So close your eyes when I let my back end hang
I ride til the motherfucking wheels fall off
Domie's got daytons, Goldie's got daytons

All burnt to the turf up in a goddamn fool
Old school motherfucker breakin jaws and rules
Choose to bang, who's to blame but myself and the set
All my peers through the years steady gettin it whet
Give me a rep, that's what I wanted most in my life
Did it all like a hawk, so I'm totin my stripes
Will I quit it, I'm comitted til the day I drop
Slangin rocks, sprayin shots, sayin fuck the cops
Locked up in the Chevy and my switches is hot
Gave em pain as I swang on the bitches I sopt
Bandanna on the antenna swangin and ridin
Eastsidin, ghetto life is invitin

Me and my brother had to walk to school
I used to get him he downposed for joe cool
A couple of dickies, with some quarter sacks
Damn cuz I can't believe my kinfolk gave me that
Had a nigga lookin G'd up
With the scarf on my head, stealin sheets on my bed
I seen baloney sandwiches without no motherfuckin bread
I stole a pack of chips with the big homie Fred
Now we sippin on some kool aid
I got suspended from school for cussin out the teacher's aid
And now I'm bout to get a whoopin, but you know I'm steady woofin
On the side where they ride the most
Eastside is the beach, westside is the coast
And we ghetto like a motherfuckin hot buttered toast
In the mornin with some government cheese (government cheese)
We keep it ghetto like a nigga shootin dice on his knees
Get your money first rule number one, hello

Say your prayers, feel your fears, shed your tears, you're afraid of hell's fire,
As you sit there and pray you'll get carried away by the choir.
And the incense is sweet, takes you right off your feet, makes you higher.

You came a-knockin', knockin' on my door,
Yeah, you really got me going, but you kept me on ice,

I was just a young boy, yeah, I was so green,
You were so experienced, you know what I mean,
Still you really got me going, but you kept me on ice,
I didn't care where I was going, no I didn't think twice.

Blind faith was all we had,
Looking back it all seems kind of sad,
We just sat around and watched it all go bad.

I said I never thanked you for everything you'd done,
I had to do a lot of walking before I could run.

And that was all you had to do, and I knew.
I couldn't get you out of my mind, you know I reached you just in time,

Rise up everyday, it felt like you were a million miles away.
And I lie down every night, I needed you beside me to make it right.

But I got a ride that the bitches love
And you won't have to wait at all
All you've got to do is ditch your boyfriend
And give sexy Michael Starr a call

I'll take your ass for a weenie ride
Spread your cheeks and swallow your pride
It's scary like a roller coaster
It will stretch you out so wide

It's better than a Ferris Wheel or a water slide

And better than the monkey bars

Or in the back of your Daddy's car
And it's open all day, night time too, seven fucking days a week
It only shuts down intermittently so I can take a leak

Ride her face down or on your side
You'll be amazed what you can fit in there

When the stars are right and you're alone
Take a journey, lock the world up tight
Out of your mind.

The hall beckons your presence, the doors
Open wide you're to decide to turn back

Deep the bowels of this black abyss,
Compelled I just can't resist it, take me
Take me away take me away
I wanna know what's deep within
Take me away

Drawing near someone passes through me,
A silent entity never looking back I won't dare.
Evil eyes staring through he walls of stone
As I feared I travel not alone

Laughter's echoes with the blatant wind
I have passed the threshold deep within me.
Take me away take me away
I wanna know what's deep within
Take me away

A voice of thunder said turn back
Tabernacle is forbidden
No mortal dares to enter here.
I want to know

Flame is burning center of a fountain yearning, waters
Spring eternal, spiritual water physical fire
Above the center is sky, cold cold never-ness
Just vastness filled with stars upon stars

In the four corners of life are the golden mirrors
Reflecting what you are and what you are to be
In the first is a young boy white dove in
His hand, in the second is a warrior in Armour
In the third is the old man gold watch
In his hand fourth and last
No reflection at all
No reflection at all
No reflection at all

Waters rise toward physical fire, voice says
Tabernacle is forbidden never looking back I don't
Dare
If the water touches the flame
Forever in darkness yes I'll remain

White dove flies from the young boys hand
Through the mirror of the old man, only way out
Take me away take me away
I wanna know what's deep within
Take me away
Take me away take me away
I wanna know what's deep within

Steel Prophet,"Born into this life a child in the world of doubt
Rejected as an orphan boy torn from his mothers side
Dogma thrown in his way obstacles from which to pass
The pain his soul endured
Has scarred his body fast
Defiant in an angry heart stubborn in his ways
Determined to reach his goals
Though numbered are his days
Lost within his mind 
Emotionally disturbed
Abused throughout childhood
Wounded deeply by words
Submerged in hate and fear
Neglected by those around
Affliction was all we had 
Lost and never found
But then something snapped within
And turned him inside out
To survive, life had to change
And mend his wounds somehow 
Rebellion against authority
To conform he would never submit
Punished by society 
Upon their face he'd spit
Scarred for life, wounded deep within
Healing the bludgeoned soul
Must somehow begin cry out in the night
Twisted in delusion crawling into the light
Scarred for life
Locked within his mind, a solitary prison cell
Depression fills him with despair
Falling to the depths of hell
Alone in a silent rage the final hours near
Desperate in insanity
He cries, but no one hears
Anger consumed his soul
In a violent state of mind
Destroyed his every thought
Soon running out of time
Lies he believed from voices in his head
Confused in chaos, wishing he was dead
Torn into this life a child in disarray
Blasphemed upon his soul
A victim of his ways

Standing by my window, breathing summer breeze
Saw a figure floating, 'neath the willow tree
Asked us if we were happy, we said we didn't know
Took us by the hands and up we go

We followed the dreamer through the purple hazy clouds
He could control our sense of time
We thought we were lost but no matter how we tried
Everyone was in peace of mind

We felt the sensations drift inside our frames
Finding complete contentment there
And all the tensions that hurt us in the past
Just seemed to vanish in thin air

He said in the cosmos is a single sonic sound
That is vibrating constantly
And if we could grip and hold on to the note
We would see our minds were free...oh they're free

We are lost above
Floating way up high
If you think you can find a way

Steel Prophet,"[Black Sabbath Cover]

Oh no, here it comes again
Can't remember when we came so close to love before
Hold on, good things never last
Nothing's in the past, it always seems to come again
Again and again, again and again and again
Cry out to legions of the brave
Time again to save us from the jackals of the street
Ride out, protectors of the realm
Captain's at the helm, sail across the sea of lights
Circles and rings, dragons and kings
Weaving a charm and a spell
Blessed by the night, holy and bright
Called by the toll of the bell
Bloodied angels fast descending
Moving on a never-bending light
Phantom figures free forever
Out of shadows, shining ever-bright
Neon Knights!
Neon Knights! All right!
Cry out to legions of the brave
Time again to save us from the jackals of the street
Ride out, protectors of the realm
Captain's at the helm, sail across the sea of lights
Again and again, again and again and again
Neon Knights!
Neon Knights! All right!

How many more times can my nerve endings explode
Jonesing again for that one last dose
Shove it in my veins until I'm comatose
[Chorus]
When I'm gone I can't do anything
The beating of my heart consumes everything
Finding a cure for this never ending quest
I battle with the demon, he cheats me with his test
I have played the fool stuck pins into my eyes
My rage of hate attacked me haunts my soul and dies
[Chorus - repeat]
Why does it control everything in me
When I'm in control I know wrong from right
But when it's in my blood i can't put up a fight
Feeling weak and powerless I begin to cry
How could I betray myself to my loved ones
cheat & lie
[Speed chorus]
I kneel before the god that stole my life
I am still alive in here but don't know how to die
Emptiness and tortured awash in misery
My body craves another fix I just wish to die
All the things I've lost and ruined repentance can't buy
When I'm stretched out on a slab no rush forever more
[Speed chorus - repeat]
As my mind breaks/sweats and my body aches/
Pushed up are the stakes/ -- /
Will I live to see/my mind cleared of slavery/
My weakness cured by bravery/ -- /

They plot your death

Don't get what you want
So you act outrageous
Whose heart you crush
You don't seem to care

One ambition
To marry a millionaire

Someone...there to wine and dine you
And give...rings all decked with diamonds, yeh
That kind of...money talkin romance
Jet set...vacation to the islands

Best things in life
I say they don't come free

CHORUS
You're looking for a sugar daddy
You don't mind if he's ugly
He's got lots of money
He will be your dandy candy

RAPPERS DELIGHT
Watch her now
She loves to pose in fancy clothes
And make the guys all stare
Who's got no cash, ain't got no chance
She want's a millionaire

A candy-coated rich man
She don't give a damn if it's Frankenstein
Or the thing from outer space
A chauffeur-driven limousine
Seems more to be her style
If you can't provide that kind if life
You just ain't worth her while

'cause she's hooked on money love
Suga, suga., suga (Repeat - fade out)

Dead end circuit dead end circuit
Dead end circuit
Come out of the dead end circuit

I man find it hard to survive
In dis ya concrete jungle
Oh system stop your riding on my back
And carry your own bundle
It's time to work for myself
And watch the finance flowing
A go deh in a Ghetto Style
Ina the street I earn my living

CHORUS

Dead end circuit
Come out of the dead end circuit

There's a chance of serving time
But I must take that gamble
It's the only real way I know
To put food on my table
And now the pressures rising
In a land of unemployment
Plenty of racial tension
And police harassment

CHORUS

Come out of the dead end circuit

Overcome these obstacles that block my way
Seek and find and create opportunity
Make our hopes and dreams
Come true in reality

Got to get outof the
Got to get out of the ARGH!

Nothings put on a plate
For you to take
Determination is the only way to make
And if you've lost your faith
You better go and find it
Faith can move the mountains
Or even break it woe o woe

It rough it tough
It rough and tuff in this dead end circuit

Create your own opportunity
Working programmes for all a we
Abandon urban slavery

Two ugly bouncers just to kick me out

Love letter from a mystery lover

Would give me chills all over Arrgh!

Thank God he was released on time

Spoke out gainst Jim Crows in justice
And never turned the other cheek
There's no room for non violent protest
Yes these words were what he preached
Taught us bout Pan Africanism
To put my people back on their feet
Take what's ours robbed by the system
He said by any means

Let Malcolm live through us
Black liberation is a must
Let Malcolm live through us
Black liberation is a must

They have tried to rid his name 
From history books and magazines
They even tried to criticize
His greatness and philosophy
Against all kinds of exploitation
For all of us he bore the pain
We won't let him be forgotten
No he did not die in vain

Put away the misconception
That he came to teach us hate
So wake up from your sleep and slumber
Wake up before its too late
We need to resurrect that spirit
A lease of life the people need
To fight resistance from the system

When you're in love with a beautiful woman, you watch her eyes;
When you're in love with a beautiful woman, you look for lies; 
'Cause everybody tempts her, 
everybody tells her she's the most beautiful woman they know; 
 
When you're in love with a beautiful woman, you go it alone.
When you're in love with a beautiful woman, you watch your friends;
When you're in love with a beautiful woman, it never ends;
When you're in love with a beautiful woman, you watch her eyes;

Warm smell of colitas, rising up through the air
Up ahead in the distance, I saw a shimmering light
My head grew heavy and my sight grew dim
I had to stop for the night.

There she stood in the doorway;
I heard the mission bell
And I was thinking to myself
'This could be heaven or this could be Hell'
Then she lit up a candle and she showed me the way
There were voices down the corridor,
I thought I heard them say

Such a lovely place (such a lovely place)
Such a lovely face.
Plenty of room at the Hotel California
Any time of year (any time of year) you can find it here

Her mind is Tiffany-twisted, she got the Mercedes bends
She got a lot of pretty, pretty boys, that she calls friends
How they dance in the courtyard, sweet summer sweat
Some dance to remember, some dance to forget

So I called up the Captain,
'Please bring me my wine'
He said, 'we haven't had that spirit here since nineteen sixty-nine'
And still those voices are calling from far away,
Wake you up in the middle of the night
Just to hear them say""

What a nice surprise (what a nice surprise), bring your alibis

Mirrors on the ceiling,
The pink champagne on ice
And she said, 'we are all just prisoners here, of our own device'
And in the master's chambers,
They gathered for the feast
They stab it with their steely knives,
But they just can't kill the beast

Last thing I remember, I was
Running for the door
I had to find the passage back to the place I was before

And so I face the final curtain
My friend, I'll say it clear
I'll state my case, of which I'm certain

I've lived a life that's full
I've traveled each and every highway
Oh, and more, much more than this
I did it my way

Regrets, I've had a few
But then again, too few to mention
I did what I had to do
And saw it through without exemption

I planned each charted course
Each careful step along the byway
But more, much more than this
I did it my way

Yes, there were times, I'm sure you knew
When I bit off more than I could chew
But through it all, when there was doubt
I ate it up and spit it out
I faced it all and I stood tall
And did it my way

I've loved, I've laughed and cried
Had my fill, my share of losing
And now, as tears subside
I find it all so amusing

To think I did all that
And may I say, not in a shy way
""Oh no, oh no not me
I did it my way""

For what is a man, what has he got?
If not himself, then he has naught

Yo there used to be a rumor about BDI
I wouldn't come back, I tell you no lie

Whenever I'm back, I'm bound to make a link
With the music that used to make me jam and jump

One nation under a groove, so my beat'll never stop

Called my nigga Kurupt, I knew it was boast
They hope a nigga in the music with this bomb

And if you read my diary it'd break your heart
Cause I been losin like a mutherfucka from the start
Excuse me--but that's the only way that I can express
My life feelin like a bunch of bullets racin through my chest
Time after time i felt the feelin that you feel when you lose
Sittin on my stoop cryin blues
Seekin refuge from these hard-time skits
Remembering days when I was literally penniless
And have to watch my people do it alone
I said it was the last time but this time I swear
I'll make it happen if I have to to lose all my hair

Livin proof that the struggle still continues
Who's out to gain for fame?
Let him not remain vain
Time will tell who fell
And who maintained
Finding my purpose in this life
Cause I ain't sure that we all promised paradise
Precisely I'm just like the seed
Planted in the Earth to bring forth new breed
Shall I proceed to manifest destiny
Surely me and all of my be	 and see
Will find our time on the line of history
Faithfully as G-O-D watchin over we
Created we so I satnd in my God Body
Hardly moved by those crews that try to charge me falsely
It won't be the first time and it won't be the last time

Calculatin', watch those steps you takin'
You never know who lies in the shadows waitin'

For you to make a slip up cause they clocked your moves
Peep where you stashed the night and how you rock the ice jewels
You was at the bar mackin', blowin' up the Jack when
They caught you off point and stripped you of your royal fashions

I met with an old man a-clothed all in leather
He was clothed all in leather with a cap beneath his chin
Singing how do you do and how do you do and how do you do again

This rustic was a thresher as on his way he hied
And with a leather bottle fast buckled by his side
He wore no shirt upon his back but wool unto his skin
Singing how do you do and how do you do and how do you do again

I went a little further and there I met a maid
A-going a-milking, a-milking Sir she said
Then I began to compliment and she began to sing
Saying how do you do and how do you do and how do you do again

This maid her name was Dolly clothed in a gown of grey
I being somewhat jolly persuaded her to stay
And straight I fell a-courting her in hopes her love to win
Singing how do you do and how do you do and how do you do again

I having time and leisure, I spent a vacant hour
A-telling of my treasure while sitting in the bower
With many kind embraces I stroke her double chin
Singing how do you do and how do you do and how do you do again

I said that I would married be and she would be my bride
And long we should not tarry and twenty things beside
I'll plough and sow and reap and mow and you shall sit and spin
Singing how do you do and how do you do and how do you do again

Steeleye Span,"It's fifty long springtimes since she was a bride,
But still you may see her at each Whitsuntide
In a dress of white linen with ribbons of green,
As green as her memories of loving.

The feet that were nimble tread carefully now,
As gentle a measure as age will allow,
Through groves of white blossoms, by fields of young corn,
Where once she was pledged to her true-love.

The fields they stand empty, the hedges grow (go) free--
No young men to turn them or pastures go see (seed)
They are gone where the forest of oak trees before
Have gone, to be wasted in battle.

Down from the green farmlands and from their loved ones
Marched husbands and brothers and fathers and sons.
There's a fine roll of honor where the Maypole once stood,

Steeleye Span,"The love that I have chosen I'll therewith be content
And the salt sea shall be frozen before that I repent
Repent it shall I never until the day I dee
But the lowlands of Holland has twined my love and me.

My love lies in the salt sea and I am on the side
It's enough to break a young thing's heart what lately was a bride.
But lately was a bonny bride with pleasure in her e'e.
But the lowlands of Holland has twined my love and me.

My love he built a bonny ship and set her on the sea
With seven score good mariners to bear her company.
But there's three score of them is sunk and three score dead at sea
And the lowlands of Holland has twined my love and me.

My love has built another ship and set her on the main
And nane but twenty mariners all for to bring her hame.
But the weary wind began to rise, the sea began to roll
And my love then and his bonny ship turned withershins about.

Then shall neither quiff come on my head nor comb come in my hair
And shall neither coal nor candlelight shine in my bower mair.
And neither will I marry until the day I dee
For I never had a love but one and he's drowned in the sea.

Steeleye Span,"True Thomas sat on Huntley bank
And he beheld a lady gay
A lady that was brisk and bold
Come riding o'er the ferny brae

Her skirt was of the grass green silk,
Her mantle of the velvet fine
At every lock of her horse's mane
Hung fifty silver bells and nine

True Thomas, he pulled off his cap
And bowed him low down to his knee
'All hail, thou mighty Queen of Heaven
Your like on earth I ne'er did see.'

'No, no Thomas she said
That name does not belong to me
I am the queen of fair Elfland
And I have come to visit thee.'

And must serve me seven years
Through well or woe, as chance may be.'

She turned about her milk white steed
And took Thomas up behind
And aye whenever her bridle rang
Her steed flew swifter than the wind

For forty days and forty nights
They rode through red blood to the knee
And they saw neither sun nor moon
But heard the roaring of the sea

And they rode on and further on
Further and swifter than the wind
Until they came to a desert wide
And living land was left behind

'Don't you see yon narrow, narrow road
So thick beset with thorns and briars?
That is the road to righteousness
Though after it but few enquire.'

'Don't you see yon broad, broad road
That lies across the lily leaven?
That is the road to wickedness
Though some call it the road to heaven.'

'Don't you see yon bonnie, bonnie road
That lies across the ferny brae?
That is the road to fair Elfland
Where you and I this night must go.'

A fair maid I did meet,
She asked me to see her home--
She lived in Bleecker Street.
Chorus:
And away you santy, my dear honey,
O you New York girls, can't you dance the polka?
And when we got to Bleecker Street,
We stopped at forty-four,
Her mother and her sister there,
To meet her at the door.
Chorus:
And when I got inside the house,
The drinks were passed around,
The liquor was so awful strong,
My head went round and round.
Chorus:
And then we had another drink,
Before we sat to eat,
The liquor was so awful strong,
I quickly fell asleep.

I had an aching head,
There was I, Jack all alone,
Stark naked in me bed.
Chorus:
My gold watch and my pocketbook
And lady friend were gone;
And there was I, Jack all alone,
Stark naked in the room.
Chorus:
On looking round this little room,
There's nothing I could see,
But a woman's shift and apron
That were no use to me.

Down Cherry Street forlorn,
There Martin Churchill took me in,
And sent me 'round Cape Horn.

Chorus: They said he's gone to America,
To work the land that some called Virginia;
They said he's gone to America.

They took him as their prisoner then told me why,
They said they had sent him where poachers go,
I asked if I could see him but they said no.

When me and my true love lay snug in one nest, 
When a bold set of ruffians broke into our cave, 
And they forced my dear jewel to plough the salt wave.

I begged hard for my darling as I would for my life.
But they'd not listen to me although a fond wife, 
Saying: The king must have sailors, to the seas he must go, 
And they left me lamenting in sorrow and woe.

Through green fields and meadows we of times have walked, 
And the fond recollections together have talked, 
Where the lark and the blackbird so sweetly did sing, 
And the lovely thrushes' voices made the valleys to ring.

And will make me amends for my trouble and strife,

Whether it be new or old

Sometimes we call at a rich man's hall
To beg for bread and beer
Sometimes we're lame, sometimes we're blind
Sometimes too deaf to hear

Let the back and sides go bare
Let the hands and feet go cold
Give to the belly beer enough
Whether it be new or old

Sometimes we lie like hogs in the sty
In a flock of straw on the ground
Sometimes eat a crust that's rolled in the dust
And are thankful it can be found

Let the back and sides go bare
Let the hands and feet go cold
Give to the belly beer enough
Whether it be new or old

From the hag and the hungry goblin
That into rags would rend you
And the spirits that stand by the naked man
In the book of moons defend you

That of your five sound senses
You never be forsaken
Nor travel from yourselves with me
Abroad to beg your bacon

Let the back and sides go bare
Let the hands and feet go cold
Give to the belly beer enough
Whether it be new or old

Let the back and sides go bare
Let the hands and feet go cold
Give to the belly beer enough
Whether it be new or old

And Daddy goes sailing, a-sailing no more
The nets will be drying, the net's heaven blessed
And safe in my arms contended he'll rest

",Love 'Em and I'm Gone,1992
Steelheart,"I fight the tears since you've been gone 
And I stand in fear, can I make it on my own 
Without your love to guide me through my life 
It's so cold at night without you here 
And those gentle arms that held me close and dear 
Oh we're all the same, we all live and die 

You'll always be in my heart, oh Mama don't you cry 
You'll always live in my dreams, oh Mama don't you cry 

Every night when I close my eyes 
I see a light and shadows of your face 
It's always there like an angel over me 

So many frozen years hangin' on my wall 
A thousand words, I can hear them call 
Oh I tried so hard but I could never say goodbye 

You'll always be in my heart, oh Mama don't you cry 
You'll always live in my dreams, oh Mama don't you cry 

No one can kiss away the pain like you 
No one like Mama, no one like you 

You'll always be in my heart, oh Mama don't you cry 
You'll always live in my dreams, oh Mama don't you cry 

(You'll always be in my heart, oh Mama don't you cry - don't you cry) 
(You'll always live in my dreams) in my dreams (Oh Mama don't you cry) 
Oh Mama don't you cry",Mama Don't You Cry,1992
Steelheart,"Stone drunk and crazy I was running from his gun 
Caught me in the corner with that look of death, said you ain't my fuckin' son 
I said man, are you crazy? Let go of my hand 
Just because you put me in this world, doesn't make you understand 

You're a 16 year old punk, you think you know it all 
You still got dirt underneath your nose, for your Mama you still call 
Hey Boy, can you hear me? I want you to get out 
Go out and fight the world like I did and learn what life's about 
No, no, no, no, I won't come easy 

Look at yourself Boy, ain't nothing but a dirty bum 
Do nothin' all day just play that guitar, and hang around with all the scum 
Your hair's down past your shoulders, I can't even see your eyes 
You're lookin' at me but I can't even tell 
Whether or not you're sellin' me lies 

You think it's been so easy, never took time out to see 
I've been standin' for years lookin' for love 
But your bottle's your friend, not me 
Are you deaf? Can you hear me? I'm knockin' on your door 
When the sun goes down I'll be on the tracks, won't see my face no more 
No, no, no, no, I won't come easy 

Cause Daddy, I'm just like you, I've got a steelheart 

Yeah, you threw me to the lions to fight 'em all alone 
Like you do, I have to suffer, to find, find, find, find my way home 
Yeah I know I will survive, somehow I'll find a way 

Live or die I'll make a stand no no no no matter what they say 

Bring on the world now, I'm down and ready to fight 
I've grown stronger than dynamite 
You can throw me down and kick me, but you're never gonna see me run 
I'll pick myself right back up and load my guns 

[Chorus]
I'm a one man army, a two man fight 
I got a steelheart and I'll die for my right 
I'm a one man army, a two man fight 
I got a steelheart and I'll die 

I've been sleeping in the doghouse, I shower in the rain 
I fought through all the fire, no no no I feel no pain 

So take me as I'm now, I'm down and easy to fight 
I've grown stronger than a pit bull's bite 
You can throw me down and kick me, but you're never gonna see me run 
I'll pick myself right back up and load my guns 

[Chorus: x2]

Yeah, I got a steel, I won't come easy, no 
I won't come easy, I won't come easy 
Steel, steel, steel, steel, steelheart

And I'll die, die for my right 
A one man army, a two man fight 
And I'll die with a stealheart",Steelheart,1992
Steelheart,"Standin' on the front line, a bullet in my head 
Run a bad luck highway mile, ridin' the rails naked and dead 
Sins of the flesh, seasons of the witch 
Ain't nobody gonna scratch my itch 
Spin another lie and tell me it's alright, yeah it's alright 
It's ow, ow, ow, ow, ow! 

[Chorus]
Smooth side down, sticky side up 
Watch me drown in your lovin' cup 
Nail me to the floor, roll me in the rug 
Smooth side down, sticky sticky side up 

Scratchin' on the back door, ringin' in my ears 
Hang dog on a ball and chain, gettin' high on the Devil's tears 

Give me a shovel, I'll dig my own grave 
Rooster go pimpin' for some other slave 
The knife's in my back, smile and tell me it's alright, yeah it's alright 
It's ow, ow, ow, ow, ow! 

[Chorus] 

Smooth side down, sticky side up 
Watch me drown in your lovin' cup 
Nail me to the floor, roll me in the rug 
Smooth side down, sticky sticky - sticky sticky side

[Chorus: x2]

Smooth side down, sticky sticky, sticky sticky, sticky sticky side up!",Sticky Side Up,1992
Steelheart,"Every step we take is the hard way 
We try to build an empire all in just one day 
But if we take a breath, and take a look around 
Are we missing things, are both feet planted on the ground 

Sometimes we forget who we are 
We take our chances much too far 
Can I find the time to show this heart of mine (a little sunshine in the rain) 
Oh, it's so hard to see, what we've grown to be 
We fight this world alone, yeah, and turn a life to stone 

[Chorus]
Take me back home, the place where we belong 
Where all our hearts still roam, now take me back home 

The grass is always green on the other side 
We climb the walls to find out to ourselves we lied 

Oh we fight so hard to make a stand 
We try and fit the world in the palms of our hands 
Oh we're searching for a piece of mind 
But the world has put money in your hands and made us blind 

Will I reach the light, that leads me through my life 
(Sometimes I hear the angels sing) 
Will I find the road, to ease my heavy load 
Make the right turn, yeah, not to crash and burn 

[Chorus] 

Yeah I still can remember, how we used to be 
Just a couple of little crazy kids, runnin' through the streets 
Now I can't change the future, I can only feel the pain 
I'm holding on, breath by breath, hiding from the rain 

[Chorus: x2]",Take Me Back Home,1992

Missing you

Talk to you but it's not the same
As touching you
And every time you whisper my name
I wanna run to you

And it won't be long

And it's out of my arms

And it's driving me crazy

Can't wait another moment
Baby, 'cuz I'm missing you now
Needing you right here by my side
Is all that I can do
Arms around my pillow at night
They should be holding you

How could I know?
How could I know?

And it's hard to be strong
Baby, 'cuz I'm missing you now

And it's driving me crazy
I'm needing my baby
I'm missing you now

I'm gonna dig myself a hole
Gonna lay down in it 'til
I satisfy my soul

Gonna let the world pass by me

I'm gonna let it roll

Steely Dan,"I recall when I was small 
How I spent my days alone 
The busy world was not for me 
So I went and found my own 
I would climb the garden wall 
With a candle in my hand 
I'd hide inside a hall of rock and sand 
On the stone an ancient hand 
In a faded yellow-green 
Made alive a worldly wonder 
Often told but never seen 
Now and ever bound to labor 
On the sea and in the sky 
Every man and beast appeared 
A friend as real as I

Before the fall when they wrote it on the wall 
When there wasn't even any Hollywood 
They heard the call 
And they wrote it on the wall 
For you and me we understood 

Can it be this sad design 
Could be the very same 
A wooly man without a face 
And a beast without a name 
Nothin' here but history 
Can you see what has been done 
Memory rush over me 
Now I step into the sun

And every word we sang
I knew was true

I crawl like a viper
Through these suburban streets
Make love to these women
Languid and bittersweet
I rise when the sun goes down
Cover every game in town

It's the dance, it's the dress, she's a concept more or less
Dumb love in the city at century's end

At century's end
Nobody's holding out for heaven
It's not for creatures here below
We just suit up for a game
The name of which we used to know
It might be careless rapture

This kid's got the eye, call it pirate radar
Scooping out the roof for some trend
But there's nobody new, so she zeros in on you

At century's end
Nobody's holding out for heaven

Go play with someone else

And the way you cut your hair 

I can see by what you carry that you come from Barrytown

He'll soon be dead

In our plot of frozen space he told his tale 

Poor man, he showed his hand
So righteous was his need 
And me so wise I bought his prize 
For chicken feed

Newfound cash soon begs to smash a state of mind 
Close inspection fast revealed his favorite kind 
Poor kid, he overdid
Embraced the spreading haze 

And while he sighed his body died 
In fifteen ways

Through the ruins of Santa Fe

Smoking cobalt cigarettes
There's no need to hide

I might live til Saturday

When the razor boy comes
And take your fancy things away
Will you still be singing it

You know that the coming is so close at hand
You feel all right
I guess only women in cages can stand
This kind of night

Can play down
The things they lose

The lies and the laughter
I hear my inside
The mechanized hum of another world
Where no sun is shining
No red light flashing
Here in this darkness
I know what I've done
I know all at once who I am

I'm a bookkeeper's son
I don't want to shoot no one
Well I crossed my old man back in Oregon
Don't take me alive
Got a case of dynamite
I could hold out here all night
Yes I crossed my old man back in Oregon
Don't take me alive",Don't Take Me Alive,1993

Did they ride into the street

To the bottom of a bad town 
Amid the ruins 
Where they learn to fear

Their dark companions 
While the memory of 
Their southern sky was clouded by 
A savage winter 
Every patron saint 
Hung on the wall, shared the room 
With twenty sinners

He thinks he's died and gone to heaven

By the old man back home

And the flowers that she wore

What was in my heart

She took the money from my old man

Ahead of her time 
She was first generation

Will you, won't you, will you, won't you, won't you join the dance?

You can really have no notion how delightful it will be
When they take us up and throw us, with the lobsters in the sea

Would not, could not, would not, could not, would not join the dance

And 'Brosie was surely struck blind,
By a sight that defies human reason:
On an island of gleaming rock,
Jutting up from the blue lagoon,
A ceremonial music box
And from it flowed, a bright new mode,
That made our hero swoon.

As you know played out its bloody romances.

With his prize in hand he took his chances.

Steely Dan,"In the mornin' you go gunnin' for the man who stole your water
And you fire till he is done in but they catch you at the border
And the mourners are all singin' as they drag you by your feet

You go back, Jack, do it again, wheels turinin' 'round and 'round
You go back, Jack, do it again

When you know she's no high climber then you find your only friend
In a room with your two timer, and you're sure you're near the end
Then you love a little wild one, and she brings you only sorrow
All the time you know she's smilin'; you'll be on your knees tomorrow

You go back, Jack, do it again, wheels turinin' 'round and 'round
You go back, Jack, do it again

Now you swear and kick and beg us that you're not a gamblin' man;
Then you find you're back in Vegas with a handle in your hand
Your black cards can make you money so you hide them when you're able
In the land of milk and honey you must put them on the table

You go back, Jack, do it again, wheels turinin' 'round and 'round
You go back, Jack, do it again",Do It Again [Album Edit],2009

"Steeve ""Makali"" Douglas","Éh!
C'est à dire qu'il y avait tellement de l'ambiance à cette époque là
Et comme j'étais un beau garçon
Quand je vois que je fête mes 30 ans aujourd'hui alors que j'avais 18 ans hier
Les jours passent comme les voitures
La vie de l'homme ne dure pas longtemps
Quel est Le Bilan de ma vie, hein, hey?

C'est fou ce que le temps passe vite
Ah si, c'est ce que je me dis aussi quand j'vois le chemin qu'on a parcouru jusqu'aujourd'hui
Je repense à notre enfance pas toujours aisée
Sans trop dramatiser
Ce n'était pas toujours rose c'est peut-être ce qui nous a motivé
L'esprit était déjà Neg'Marrons petits vagabonds à têtes grainées
On préférait sécher les cours et rester s'vanner au quartier
L'excès de curiosité était tel
Qu'on s'enjaillait en suivant les aînés qui étaient pour nous des modèles
À l'époque dans les halls les gangs breakent, smurfent, parfois se rebellent
Fresh Boys, B-Boys représentaient Garges-Sarcelles
Je me rappelle y'avait des bandes et des gangs
Y'avait même des gang-bangs
C'est vrai qu'on bandait à peine mais on voulait déjà ken
Partager nos kiffs, nos ambitions, objectifs, ddevenir quelqu'un
Un point commun celui de réussir par tous les moyens
Maintenant j'comprends Ben-J que quand on était gamin
On avait le même itinéraire mais pas le même destin

Le temps passe et passe et passe et beaucoup de choses ont changé
Qui aurait pu s'imaginer que le temps se serait si vite écoulé
On fait le Bilan calmement en s'remémorant chaque instant
Parler des histoires d'avant comme si on avait 50 ans

Qui aurait pu s'imaginer que le temps se serait si vite écoulé
On fait le Bilan calmement en s'remémorant chaque instant
Parler des histoires d'avant comme si on avait 50 ans

Ben-J tu te souviens ce qui nous a donné l'envie d'écrire
L'oreille scotchée sur Nova à l'écoute des MCs qui déchirent
De là nos premières rimes naissent
Les jeux de mots, puis les jeux de scène
Ne cessent de s'enchaîner des MJC aux sound systems
Et puis en un éclair nous voici sous les projecteurs
On s'adapte et on domine, professionnel ou amateur
Tu le sais
C'est la monnaie qui dirige le monde, c'est la monnaie qui dirige la terre
Nous propulse aux sommets des hits de là tout s'est passé si vite
C'est boule de neige, premier album, studio, promo, clip vidéo
Les Neg'Marrons s'exportent en live et prennent tous les publics d'assaut
Dans les quatres coins de la France on est partis fout' le dawa
Comme dans les avant-premières de Steel Pulse et des Fugees à Ris-Pa
On a tout déchiré le 22 mai à l'Olympia
Pour baptiser le concert mythique avec tout le Secteur Ä
La musique m'a mis official qu'est-ce que j'aurais fait sans elle
J'ai esquivé les plans couchals aujourd'hui j'kiffe grâce à elle

Le temps passe tellement vite t'as vu comment on a changé
Ky-Ja t'as pris du poids, Ben-J toi t'as encore poussé
Regarde ça se passe tu brilles des pieds à la tête
Blanches baskets, de l'or aux poignets jusqu'aux lunettes Cartier
Pas plus que toi négro respect au Congo
Toutes les rates me parlent de toi et de Bisso Na Bisso
Merci mais dis-leur que je ne suis plus le même
Que depuis, j'ai un fils et aussi une femme qui m'aime
C'est ça, faut construire une famille assurer sa descendance
Même si ce n'est pas encore mon heure t'inquiète chaque jour j'y pense

Millon things are running trough my brain

There's too many excuses
Instead of what truth is
Fammi dire...

I've heard the world can say a lot
But I know I can stand all deaf in here
My ears ring
And I realize...

Sometimes I'm just trying
To get so far away from here

Trying to find some wisdom
That I hope that I can use

And the light that shines before us
Is looking brighter than the sun

Time is not my enemy my friend
But let it be again...

Every day our last chance
Do that parades and all the world is due

scared of simple conversation
Unaware it's not me that you're fighting
Just hold me...
...so I breathe again!

Believe the sound of thunder 
Is just a never ending kiss

We hold on to forever
So there's nothing I will miss

Try to get it 
Just try like
We've never seen before

Time will be my enemy again
So let it be again

Love is the key 
To be who you are...
To change what you can
And leave the rest of it...

To get so far away from here

Trying to find some wisdom
That I hope that I can use

Stefan Forssén,"Walked with no one and talked with no one
And I had nothing but shadows
Then one morning you passed
And I brightened at last
Now I greet the day and complete the day
With the sun in my heart
All my worry blew away
When you taught me how to say

Grab your coat and get your hat
Leave your worry on the doorstep
Just direct your feet
To the sunny side of the street
Can't you hear a pitter-pat?
And that happy tune is your step
Life can be so sweet
On the sunny side of the street

I used to walk in the shade
With those blues on parade
But I'm not afraid

And rubies fill each bin,
The sun sits high in a sapphire sky when my ship comes in.

I can wait the years
Till it appears
One fine day one spring,
But the pearls and such
They won't mean much if there's missing just one thing.

Our summer day withers away
Too soon, too soon.

Speak low when you speak, love,
Our moment is swift, like ships adrift,
We're swept apart too soon.

Speak low, darling speak low,
Love is a spark lost in the dark,
Too soon, too soon,
I feel wherever I go
That tomorrow is near, tomorrow is here
And always too soon.

Time is so old and love so brief,
Love is pure gold and time a thief.

Fair as a summer's dawn
I lost my love, I never knew where
Suddenly she was gone
The west wind's purple meadow
The night she slipped away
And I seem to glimpse her shadow 
When the west wind brushes the day

West wind, can you waken my true love
West wind, can you restore a new love
Speak to her softly of the dream we lost
The theme we lost, the gleam we lost

West wind, can you call back an old love
West wind, can you kindle a cold love
West wind, can the magic of them become out once again

Then some day at last we 
Can recapture the past",West Wind,2000

Inside my lonely room, there is no in between 
Whispering pines, rising of the tide, 
If only one star shines 

That's just enough to get inside, 
I will wait until it all goes around 
With you in sight, the lost are found, 
Foghorn through the night, calling out to sea 
Protect my only light, 'cause she once belonged to me. 
Let the waves rush in, let the seagulls cry 
For if I live again, these hopes will never die, 
I can feel you standing there 

But I don't see you anywhere, 
Standing by the well, wishing for the rains 
Reaching for the clouds, for nothing else remains, 
Drifting in a daze, when evening will be done 
Try looking through a haze, 
At an empty house, in the cold, cold sun 
I will wait until it all goes around, 
With you in sight, the lost are found",Whispering Pines,2003

The world's not falling apart, the world's not falling apart, because of me. 

I have watched the kids who make their scenes. I have met the riot grrls who print their zines. 
They write the word, they raise a thought. They say who they are, they try what they're not. 
Because life is such a changing art, life is such a changing art. 

The world's not falling apart, the world's not falling apart, because of me. 

The closest thing to God that I have heard, is when I knew I did not have the final word.

Augen und mit schwarzem Haar

Wieder, in dieser Stadt 
Werd' ich immer nur ein Fremder sein, und allein

Von alten Häusern und jungen Frauen, die alleine sind
Und von dem Kind das seinen Vater noch nie sah

Und das Ersparte genügt zu
Hause für ein kleines Glück

Stefan Roberts,"Lake Tahoe.
Cold mountain water. Don't ever swim there.
Just stand on the edge and look in there.
And you might see a woman down there.

They say some days, up she comes, up she rises, as if out of nowhere.
Wearing Victorian dress.
She was calling her pet, ""Snowflake! Snowflake!""
Tumbling like a cloud that has drowned in the lake.

Just like a poor, porcelain doll...
Her eyes are open but no-one's home.
The clock has stopped.
So long she's gone.

No-one's home.
Her old dog is sleeping.
His legs are frail now.
But when he dreams,

He runs...
Along long beaches and sticky fields.
Through the Spooky Wood looking for her.
The beds are made. The table is laid.

The door is open - someone is calling: It's a woman.
""Here boy, here boy! You've come home!
I've got an old bone and a biscuit and so much love.
Miss me? Did you miss me?

Here's the kitchen - There's your basket.
Here's the hall - That's where you wait for me.
Here's the bedroom - You're not allowed in there.
Here's my lap - That's where you lay your head.

Here boy, oh you're a good boy.
You've come home.
You've come home.""",Lake Tahoe,2011

Ich schlafe nicht mehr ein
Nur ab und zu bringen meine rosa Freunde mich heim.

Was der andre grad mit dir tut
Soll ich vielleicht sagen - schlafen sie gut ?

Mein Gesicht ist mir fremd
Die Zeiten sind ewig her.
Ich bin oft betrunken und eigentlich fast schon tot
Was soll ich dir sagen - es geht mir gut.

Die ist ein Gedicht
Vor der Tür hängt ein Schild: bitte stören Sie nicht !
Dein Gift wirkt noch immer und macht mich zärtlich kaputt
Was soll ich dir sagen - es geht mir gut.

Face caress on a warm pane.

Moments so unnoticed they slip through your hand.

Precious and small and great in the things they bring.

Eating sweet dough from a bowl.
Her moments of joy, jumping in puddles,
Breathing in rain on its way.

No poor on the streets and the people are free.
Imagine a life where you can do as you please.
Nothing to stop you from living your dream.

So why not make this a reality?
We can rebuild societies.
C'mon all you got to do is believe.

Imagine a feeling that's so unreal.
It's a natural high from the clarity.
We can all change society
If we just focus and start to believe.
Unnatural disasters off the streets
Clear our minds and let the world breathe.
This could all come if we work as one
'til we all unite and we get our jobs done.

Right now we are all too distant,
Too blind and too resistant
To see the situations we must solve.
Our lies and cries and misconceptions
Throw us in the wrong direction.
But if we change, a revolution could evolve.

Over the years friendships have died.
Wars have been fought and tears have been cried.
Enough with the hate, let's learn to forgive.
Rekindle the love and never regret.
Colors will fade if we don't take a stand.
The world will turn gray if we're not hand-in-hand.
Let's stop our fighting, let's see eye to eye.
It'll be alright, keep our hands up high.

Right now we are all too distant,
Too blind and too resistant
To see the situations we must solve.
Our lies and cries and misconceptions
Throw us in the wrong direction.

This is a sad day
The saddest day we've ever known
No, I never thought we'd come so far
Over means that fall so fast

Another car crash by the side of the road
We'll take one more glance till the story is cold
Draw the lines of whats real
Re-imagine the truth
Every fiction turns fact when its running with you

Any hint of trouble there's a camera awaiting
Every way you turn there goes another flash
We cling to the wreckage it's our guilty pleasure
And once you get the hunger then you can't turn back

This is a sad day
The saddest day I've ever known
We swore to hold our heads up high
We swore we'd look away

Another breakdown more fuel on the fire
Its just another bad dance of the sick and the tired
We memorize these lines, pretend that we're friends
With no consequence so we know how it ends

Any hint of trouble there's a camera awaiting
Every way you turn there goes another flash
We cling to the wreckage it's our guilty pleasure
And once you get the hunger then you can't turn back

This is a sad day, this could be the day we say 
I will not be a part of this at least just for today
Its hard to pick though, the reaction is mixed
I gotta get some bad news gotta get me a fix

I felt a bump and heard an ""Oh, beg your pardon""
Suddenly I saw polka dots and moonbeams
All around a pug-nosed dream

The music started and was I the perplexed one
I held my breath and said ""May I have the next one?""
In my frightened arms, polka dots and moonbeams
Sparkled on a pug-nosed dream

There were questions in the eyes of other dancers
As we floated over the floor
There were questions but my heart knew all the answers
And perhaps a few things more

Now in a cottage built of lilacs and laughter
I know the meaning of the words ""Ever after""
And I'll always see polka dots and moonbeams
When I kiss the pug-nosed dream",Polka Dots and Moonbeams,2001
Stefano Bertoli,"It's very clear, our love is here to stay
Not for a year but ever and a day
The radio and the telephone and the movies that we know
May just be passing fancies and in time may go

But oh, my dear, our love is here to stay
Together we're going a long, long way
In time the Rockies may crumble, Gibraltar may tumble
They're only made of clay
But our love is here to stay

In time the Rockies may crumble, Gibraltar may tumble
They're only made of clay
But our love is here to stay",Our Love Is Here to Stay,2008
Stefano Bollani,"Gee, but it's tough to be broke, kid.
It's not a joke, kid, it's a curse.
My luck is changing, it's gotten from 
simply rotten to something worse
Who knows, some day I will win too. 
I'll begin to reach my prime.

Now though I see what our end is,
All I can spend is just my time.

I can't give you anything but love, baby.
That's the only thing I've plenty of,baby.

Dream awhile, scheme awhile
We're sure to find

Happiness and I guess
All those things you've always pined for.

Gee I'd like to see you looking swell, baby.
Diamond bracelets Woolworth doesn't sell, baby.

Till that lucky day you know darned well, baby.
I can't give you anything but love.

Rome wasn't built in a day, kid.
You have to pay, kid, for what you get.
But I am willing to wait, dear, 
Your little mate, dear, will not forget.

You have a lifetime before you.
I'll adore you, come what may.

Please don't be blue for the present, 
When it's so pleasant to hear you say

I can't give you anything but love, baby.
That's the only thing I've plenty of,baby.

Stefano Bollani,"Sometimes the world is a valley of heartaches and tears
And in the hustle and bustle, no sunshine appears
But you and I have our love always there to remind us
There is a way we can leave all the shadows behind us
Volare, oh, oh! Cantare, oh, oh, oh, oh!
Let's fly way up to the clouds, away from the maddening crowds
We can sing in the glow of a star that I know of
Where lovers enjoy peace of mind
Let us leave the confusion and all disillusion behind
Just like birds of a feather a rainbow together we'll find
Volare, oh, oh! Cantare, oh, oh, oh, oh!
No wonder my happy heart sings
Your love has given me wings
Your love has given me wings",Volare,1997
Stefano Bollani,"How did I know that the warmth of the glow would last.
How did I guess that the long loneliness was past.
I merely looked at you and I knew that I knew.

It's you or no one for me
I'm sure of this each time we kiss
Now and forever and when forever's done
You'll find that you are still the one

Please don't say no to my plea
'Cause if you do then I'm all through
There's this about you
My world's an empty world without you
It's you or no one for me

Stefano Caniato,"Skylark
Have you anything to say to me?
Won't you tell me where my love can be?
Is there a meadow in the mist
Where someone's waiting to be kissed?

Skylark
Have you seen a valley green with spring?
Where my heart can go a journeying
Over the shadows and the rain
To a blossom covered lane

And in your lonely flight
Haven't you heard the music in the night?
Wonderful music, faint as a will o' the wisp
Crazy as a loon, sad as a gypsy serenading the moon

Oh skylark
I don't know if you can find these things
But my heart is riding on your wings
So if you see them anywhere
Won't you lead me there?

Oh skylark

Stefano d'Anna,"My heart is sad and lonely
For you I sigh, for you dear only
Why haven't you seen it
I'm all for you body and soul

I spend my days in longing
And wondering why it's me you're wronging
I tell you I mean it
I'm all for you body and soul

I can't believe it
It's hard to conceive it
That you'd turn away romance
Are you pretending
It looks like the ending
Unless I could have just one more chance to prove, dear

My life a wreck you're making
You know I'm yours for just the taking
I'd gladly surrender myself to you body and soul

Stefano di Battista,"The night is like a lovely tune
Beware my foolish heart
How white the ever constant moon
Take care my foolish heart

There's a line between love and fascination
That's hard to see, how many names such as this
For they both have the very same sensation
When you're locked in the magic of a kiss

Her lips are much too close to mine
Beware my foolish heart
But should our eager lips combine
Then let the fire start

For this time it isn't fascination
Or a dream that will fade and fall apart
It's love, this time it's love
My foolish heart",My Foolish Heart,1998
Stefano di Battista,"Moonlight and magnolia, starlight in your hair
All the world a dream come true
Did it really happen, was I really there, was I really there with you?
 
We lived our little drama, we kissed in a field of white
And stars fell on Alabama last night
I can't forget the glamor, your eyes held a tender light
And stars fell on Alabama last night
I never planned in my imagination a situation so heavenly
A fairy land where no one else could enter
And in the center just you and me, dear
My heart beat like a hammer, my arms wound around you tight
And stars fell on Alabama last night

Stefano di Battista,"It begins to tell
'Round midnight, midnight
I do pretty well, till after sundown
Suppertime I'm feelin' sad
But it really gets bad
'Round midnight

Memories always start 'round midnight
Haven't got the heart to stand those memories
When my heart is still with you
And ol' midnight knows it, too
When a quarrel we had needs mending
Does it mean that our love is ending
Darlin' I need you, lately I find
You're out of my heart
And I'm out of my mind

Let our hearts take wings'
'Round midnight, midnight
Let the angels sing
For your returning
Till our love is safe and sound
And old midnight comes around
Feelin' sad
Really gets bad
Round, Round, Round Midnight",'Round Midnight,2005
