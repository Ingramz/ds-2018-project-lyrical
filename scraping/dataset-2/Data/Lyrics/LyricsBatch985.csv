Scorpions,"Well it seems that I was lost
In intoxicated nights
Following the trace of ecstasy
With no future and no past
Just the present was alive
Like a prisoner chained on to a dream

I was drowning in a feeling
That obsession rules
'till the morning kills the creatures of the night
And I read your lipstick message
On the mirror of the truth
Now that you're gone I realize
Without you
Life's like a song without music
Without you
This world won't be the same

I need your love, every minute
I need your love, every day
I need your love, every minute
I need your love, come back and stay

Well I know that I was lost
In the nightmare of my life
Following the flash of fantasy
In a feeling that exploded
I'd left reality behind
Addicted to the power of a dream
Without you
Life's like that road that leads nowhere
Without you
The world won't feel the same

I need your love, every minute
I need your love, every day
I need your love, every minute
I need your love, come back and stay",Every Minute Every Day,1988
Scorpions,"I love you once
Rock you twice
My love's a gun that wants to talk tonight
I kiss the lust
Right from your lips
The way it feels will hit you like a blitz

Day after day
Day after day I rock the speed
Night after night
Night after night

Love on the run
Always loaded like a gun
For love

Turn outside in
And inside out
With me you'll find the kicks you've never found
I kiss the pearl
Right from the shell
Until You'll feel what all these words can't tell
Day after day
Day after day I'm burning free
Night after night
Night after night

Love on the run
Always loaded like a gun
For love on the run",Love on the Run,1988
Scorpions,"They're watching me
They're watching you
Taking all the world under control
They make you laugh
They make you blue
In the end they try to eat your soul

Satellites transmit the latest thrill
We can't escape the media overkill

A purple flash
The biggest crash
Totally in tune around the world
They take you high
They make you cry
We are at the point of no return

Satellites transmit the latest thrill
We can't escape the media overkill

Over and over and over",Media Overkill,1988
Scorpions,"We come to you through a storm of lightning
To drive this place totally insane
Another show that really keeps us fighting
For what it takes to blow your mind away
Hey you, are you ready for tonight
Can you hear me now
Let me hear you too

We come to you through a wall of thunder
Electrified by the sound of the guitars
Hey you, are you ready for tonight
Can you see me now
I want to see you out there

We let it rock to free your energy
You let it roll, come on get on your feet
We let it rock to feed your hungry dreams
You let it roll, up to the ecstasy

We come to you through a burst of fire
Energized by the feedback of the crowd
Hey you, are you ready for tonight
Can you feel me now
Can you feel the groove

We let it rock to free your energy
You let it roll, come on get on your feet
We let it rock to feed your hungry dreams
You let it roll, up to the ecstasy",We Let It Rock...You Let It Roll,1988
Scorpions,"When the daylight is falling down into the night
And the sharks try to cut a big piece out of life
It feels alright to go out to catch an outrageous thrill
But it's more like spinning wheels of fortune
Which never stand still

Big city, big city nights
You keep me burning
Big city, big city nights

When the sunlight is rising up in my eyes
And the long night has left me back at somebody's side
It feels alright for a long sweet minute like hours before
But it's more like looking out for something
I can't find anymore

Big city, big city nights
You keep me burning
Big city, big city nights
Always yearning

There is no dream
That you can't make true, if you're looking for love
But there's no girl
Who's burning the ice away from my heart
Maybe tonight!

Big city, big city nights
You keep me burning
Big city, big city nights
Always yearning

Big city, big city nights
You keep me burning
Big city, big city nights
Always yearning",Big City Nights,1989
Scorpions,"Hey you, I'm in love with your eyes
 And the sound of your name
 Hey you, I'm in love with your smile
 And the way you're dressed today

 Hey you, well I like the way you walk
 Just like a star moves on stage
 Hey you, well I like the way you talk
 You're really calm for your age

 I really die
 You're driving me wild
 I really die
 I'm in love 100 times

 I really die
 You're driving me wild
 I really die
 I'm in love a hundred times
 To be your answer

 Hey you, I said you know what's going on
 Do you know what I mean

It's a certain kind
I feel hot and cold
Deep down in my soul

I said I can't explain
I'm feeling good enough baby

And I'm feeling blue
Things you say but maybe they're true
Getting funny dreams again and again

Scorpions,"It's early morning, the sun comes out
Last night was shaking and pretty loud
My cat is purring, it scratches my skin
So what is wrong with another sin?

Desire is coming, it breaks out loud
Lust is in cages till storm breaks loose
Just have to make it with someone I choose

The night is calling, I have to go

He's licking his lips, he's ready to win
On the hunt tonight for love at first sting

Scorpions,"I get up in the morning
For my dose of the news
Crawl right back in the sack girl
Had enough of the truth

Spend your dollars and rubels
Buy a piece of the wall
Build it up in your backyard
I'm so sick of it all

Take a ride to the danger zone
If someone wants to cut you down to size

I'm ready for that hit between the eyes
Someone get me out of here alive
I'm ready for that hit between the eyes

Scorpions,"Another morning, such as ordinary day
She's doin' time from nine to five
The hours waste away
There's no escape, She's a part of the bog machine

But still I'm holding on
Searchin' for love that lasts forever
Lookin' for a place
Where love can hide away

Don't move, the knife is right at your throat

 Your look just makes me a believer
 Stray cats are landing in a rain storm
 Crashed down lost in wango tango land
 Spaced out your body gives me fever
 You sex it
 Relax it
 Reload it
 You want it freshly squeezed
 Closed down the road of all restrictions
 Mad dogs are tearing down the roof again
 Sweet noise is pouring from the speakers
 Last dance I'm drowning in the moonlight
 Exit is the door that I can't find
 Black out it can't get it any deeper
 You sex it
 Relax it
 Reload it
 And never hold it
 You slash it
 Refresh it
 Reload it
 You want it fresh
 Got no diamonds rings
 But a song to sing
 Just to make you fly

 What you give, you get back
 As long as I can think I've been
 Running to be free
 There's not a place that could have been too far
 Had nothing but a bag of dreams
 And this old guitar
 A couple of songs to play for you an me
 There's so much love inside of me
 That wants to be released
 I can't help it so I give it all away
 What you give you get it back
 So take my love just because it's all I have
 Take my heart take my soul
 I just never want it back
 As long as I've been living
 I've had music in my veins
 I can't go on without it anymore
 My suitcase is a wanderer
 That takes me I believe
 For a walk right across your heart
 There's so much love inside of you
 That wants to be released
 And all you gotta do is let it go
 What you give you get back
 So take my love just because it's all I have
 Take my heart take my soul
 I just never want it back
 Cause the love you give, is the love you'll get
 There's so much love inside of me
 That wants to be released
 I can't help it so I gave it all away
 What you give you get back
 So take my love just because it's all I have
 What you give you get back

In the early morning sun
They saw that girl that come to heaven 

They ask her 'bout life on earth
If it was getting any better
She told 'em someone took her life
If they could send her back
Just one more time
She knew that someone feels so blue

To spread the wings and fly, don't kill the butterfly
To see him one more time, hold on
To be a yellow butterfly, don't kill the butterfly

Lost inside a cloud of darkness
When I saw the butterfly
Dancing in the wind

With gold cards in motion
And the platinum too

As I walk in the pouring rain

Cause the love you give, is the love you'll get
There's so much love inside of me
That wants to be released
I can't help it so I gave it all away
What you give you get back
So take my love just because it's all I have
What you give you get back
So take my love just because it's all I have
Take my heart take my soul
I just never want it back
Cause your love, your love is all I have
All I have
Love is all we have
All I have

In a roaring sixties summer night

Nikita hit us with a shoe
We watched the world go upside down
When the Kennedys got shot
We were screaming when the world was fab
We had Rock 'n' Roll invade our hearts
We had Elvis, Janis, Marilyn
And hair, to let it grow

You're lovin' me to death",You're Lovin' Me to Death,2007
Scorpions,"Here I am
Writing my last song for you
Hear the words carefully
And you'll see it's you
I'm leaving
Don't want to be the one to tell you
That I can't stay another day

I'll throw the pages on the floor
I'm starting over like before
I'll change this stupid ending
And stay with you forever more
But when I'm lying next to you
It's hard to bargain with the truth
Cause when you know the love is gone
The time has come to write your last song

There you are
Smiling at me from the next room
Beautiful as the first day I met you
And I'm so sorry
I couldn't be the one to love you
The way that you deserve to be

I'll throw the pages on the floor
I'm starting over like before
I'll change this stupid ending
And stay with you forever more
But when I'm lying next to you
It's hard to bargain with the truth
Cause when you know the love is gone
The time has come to write your last song

It's hard to think of you and I
As total strangers
I've lived this last goodbye
A million times or more in my mind
My mind, my mind

Oh and I'm gonna miss you
But I can't go back
Even just to kiss you
Cause I can't exist
Just living a lie
Gotta lot of love to give
You know before I die
And as I watch you
Sing along
It's killing me to know
That it's your last song",Your Last Song,2007

Wanna move your hips
See my desire in your laser-beam eyes

About the the things you said concerning my singing

Oh, you said the top ten billboards, I could break in
Tell me are you for real or just faking?

I would work on my flow if you thought I had hip-hop in me

To impress the girls I'd work on my sensitivity
As for my debts, who's proud for punk crowd longevity

And if you told me that I could be famous
I present you with a list of changes I could make
We could fake the world out

It's all 'cause of us I'd caused shotgun on the tour bus
Playing every show shirt lest ladies would adore us
Throwing pennies on stage at every single chorus
Then we'd break up the band 'cause all this money bores us

But it was hard, so hard to believe
Standing among the ruins of a dream

But from here looking back, you can see clearly that
You can gain from things that you lose
And learn many ways by many means

You have been an inspiration to me
And all the volumes of hope your revival can speak
Will always say to me

Scott Dente,"Where there is love there is a peace 
And in the cages that bind the bitter heart it is release 
Hold it close to your chest, let it move and let it rest 
For it is here to set your mind at ease 
Where there is love there is a peace. 

Where there is hope there is a dream 
To rise above, to remit and to redeem 
To go back, to go where there's no hurt or anger there 
To find the song that you once could sing 
Where there is hope there is a dream. 

Where there is faith there is a chance 
To alter the course and fight the winds of circumstance 
Not to scar, but mend, not to break, but to bend 
And not to know but to understand 
Where there is faith there is a chance 
Where there is hope there is a dream. 

Where there is love there is a peace...

I held my breath and said ""May I have the next one?""

As we floated over the floor
There were questions but my heart knew all the answers

Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb
Always reminding me that we're apart
You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms

Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain

Starry night, campfire light, and the coyote calls where the howlin' winds will.
So I ride out to the ol' sundown. I am just a cowboy, lonesome on the trail.
Lord I'm just thinking about a certain female.
And the nights we spent together, riding on the range.
Looking back, it doesn't seem so strange.

Roll me over and turn me around. Let me keep spinning 'til I hit the ground.
Roll me over and let me go, riding in the rodeo.

I was took in Texas, I did not know her name.
But Lord all these southern girls, they seem the same.
But down below the border, in a town in Mexico,
I got my job busting broncs for the rodeo.

Roll me over ans turn me around, let me keep spinnin till I hit the ground.
Roll me over and let me go, running free with the buffalo.

Roll me over, and I'll turn around.
And I'll move my fingers up and down.
Up and down.

It's ok amigo, just let me go.

Scott Hamilton,"And now the purple dusk of twilight time
Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb
Always reminding me that we're apart
You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms
The nightingale 
Tells his fairytale
Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain
My stardust melody
The memory of love's refrain.",Stardust,1993
Scott Hamilton,"I can only give you love that lasts forever,
And the promise to be near each time you call,
And the only heart I own is yours and yours alone, that's all, that's all.
I can only give you country walks in springtime,
And a hand to hold when leaves begin to fall,
And a love whose burning light to warm the winter night, that's all, that's all.
There are those I am sure who have told you,
They will give you the world for a toy.
All I ask for these arms to enfold you, and a love, time can never destroy.
If you're wond'ring what I'm asking in return, dear,
You'll be glad to know that my demands are small.
Say it's me that you'll adore for now and ever more, that's all, that's all.",That's All,1993
Scott Hamilton,"Whenever skies look gray to me
And trouble begins to brew,
Whenever the Winter winds become too strong,
I concentrate on you.

When fortune cries ""Nay! Nay!"" to me
And people declare ""You're through!"",
Whenever the blues become my only song,
I concentrate on you.

On your smile so sweet, so tender,
When at first your kiss I decline.
On the light in your eyes when I surrender,
And once again our arms intertwine

And so, when wise men say to me
That love's young dream never comes true,
To prove that even wise men can be wrong,
I concentrate on you.",I Concentrate on You,1993
Scott Hamilton,"The look of love
Is in your eyes

I can hardly wait to hold you
Feel my arms around you
How long I have waited
Waited just to love you
Now that I have found you

Beware my foolish heart
How white the ever constant moon
Take care my foolish heart

There's a line between love and fascination
That's hard to see, how many names such as this
For they both have the very same sensation
When you're locked in the magic of a kiss

Her lips are much too close to mine
Beware my foolish heart
But should our eager lips combine
Then let the fire start

For this time it isn't fascination
Or a dream that will fade and fall apart

Or it's quiet or it's mad,
It's a good thing or it's bad,
But beautiful!

Beautiful to take a chance
And if you fall, you fall,
And I'm thinking I wouldn't mind at all.
Love is tearful or it's gay.
It's a problem or it's play,
It's a heartache either way,
But beautiful!

And I'm thinking if you were mine
I'd never let you go,
And that would be but beautiful I know.",But Beautiful,1994

I'm gonna hold on to it till that eagle grins

That you're down and out
In your pocket, there's not not one penny
And as for friends, you don't have any

Scott Hamilton,"At last, my love has come along
my lonely days are over, and life is like a song
At last,the skies above are blue
My heart was wrapped in clover
Every since the night I looked at you

And I found a dream that I could speak to
A dream to call my own
I found a thrill to press my cheek to
A thrill I'd never known
When you smiled, and then the spell was cast
And here we are in Heaven, I found my love at last

Where someone's waiting to be kissed?

Where my heart can go a journeying
Over the shadows and the rain

One look is all you'd need to see the mood I'm in.
Perhaps then you'd realize I'm still in love with you.

And trying awfully hard to make my tears behave
But that's quite impossible, I'm still in love with you.
 
You'll happen my way on some mem'rable day
And the month will be May for a while.
I'll try to smile but can I play the part

Sweet to my ears is the song every bluebird sings,
Each rosebud kissed by the dew,
All this is mine and heaven too.

The sentimental breeze, the dreamy streams that flow,
Every country lane and every street of stone
Are highways of adventure made for me alone.

Until you've kissed and had to pay the cost,
Until you've flipped your heart and you have lost,
You don't know what love is.

Do you know how a lost heart fears
At the thought of reminiscing,
And how lips that taste of tears
Lose their taste for kissing?

She is cold I agree
She might laugh, but I love it

And every stop that we made

Where my heart can go a journeying
Over the shadows and the rain
To a blossom covered lane

At the close of day
When the joys of the day fade away and the memories sweet
Of the day repeat 
In our dreams they creep
While we sleep, sleep, sleep
It seems that daytime was just made for laughter and song
Evening brings romance to lovers as they stroll along
Night time brings rest to the weary
Sooths all the hearts that are dreary
Leaves us alone with our day dreams
Brings back sweet golden love dreams while we sleep, sleep, sleep

And climb that stairway to the stars
With love beside us to fill the night with a song

Out yonder where the blue begins

Can't we sail away on a lazy daisy petal
Over the rim of the hill?

Beware my foolish heart
How white the ever constant moon
Take care my foolish heart

There's a line between love and fascination
That's hard to see, how many names such as this
For they both have the very same sensation
When you're locked in the magic of a kiss

Her lips are much too close to mine
Beware my foolish heart
But should our eager lips combine
Then let the fire start

For this time it isn't fascination
Or a dream that will fade and fall apart
It's love, this time it's love

But it never gets cold, and that I know for sure
There's a rusted gate and a chandelier,
A flowered door and a mattress on the floor
She lays me down so low here under the stars
And knowing it won't last just tears me apart

This is how it goes
This is how it goes
Baby, we're rolling
Just a boat on the ocean
Up in the sky
Heaven so close

Taking off your clothes
Taking off my clothes
Give me a moment
I don't care if it's stolen
Way up high
In your sweet little bungalow

She's got a temper, yeah like a redhead
A tabby cat and a tattoo she regrets
She's a carpenter with a book of poems
Got another side that no one really knows
Watching through the window you smile in the dark
Knowing we can't stay here, but you left a mark

This is how it goes

Give me a moment
I don't care if it's stolen
Way up high

This is enough, don't be insecure
As long as you kiss me when I walk through your window
To your door and I'll know
When the night is filled with cold
We'll be warm, and nothing matters
When the world is moving slow
I got you in my arms
Now it's fine, don't feel low

When you was growing up

[H.A.W.K]
I use to sit and watch the Flinstones, Gucci rolls and herringbones
Bezel sets and baguettes, while talking on my cell phone
From Bo-Bo's to Air Macs, low cars to horse backs
Hoopties to Cadillacs, water guns to chrome gats
Levis to Guess jeans, black and white to big screens
Six by nine to 18's, Bumsalack to sipping lean
Regals with white walls, 20 inch with screens fall
Michael Jackson off the wall, to MJG and 8Ball
Screw house to wrecking flows, to BET on videos
Zig-zags and yellow bags, to Glad sacks and optimos
Fist fight to gun play, sawed-offs to a.k.'s
Spitting flows at talent shows, as the H-A-W-K
Riding on the Metros, pushing a six double O
Smoking cess to endo, fill it up with petro
Fixing on my lego, let go of my ego
Get in with my little bro, getting up when the rooster blow

[Lil Flip]
I remember Kangaroos and afro curls, always running after girls
Trying to sneak in Natural World, BB gun shooting at the squirrels
Candy red on tricycles, training wheels on bicycles
Sugar Daddy's, Pixie Stix, peppermints and side pickles
Loaded toes and Scooby Doo, some of the things we use to do
Roller skate now roller blades, Ivy Leagues to holding fades
Blow-Pop rings and diamond things, herringbones to bezeltines
Cadillacs to limousines, ironing jeans to being clean
GI Joes to Tonka toys, eating Willy Wonka boy
Riding in my uncle's car, wanting to become a star
Having dreams to be like Mike, hooping in my all black Nikes
Flying kites and shooting dice, sneaking in the movies twice
Staying up and watching Cops, walking outside in Michael socks
Being afraid of chicken pox, check my bowl on Magnavox
Running up and down my block, sweating cause the sun is hot
I use to ride the city bus, now I'm pulling Hummers out

[AP]
I remember brothers getting dumped off, in ditches and bayous
Boys gave head jobs, and all I saw was hairdo's
Pimps drove Lacs and dob hats, with chrome gats
Hustlers stack paper, with the players and macs
Police burns in the hood, because somebody just got jacked
Every girl I slam they call, I told em call me back
Haters got backhanded, because they were always talking smack
Instigators chit chat, and were known for spreading rumors
Ballers went from stabs, to buying more of consumers
I use to eat on tuna, now it's shrimp and caviar
I use to be a virgin, now I have menage tois
I use to drink on soda, now I'm sipping mixed with bar
I use to stay in the ghetto, now I'm a ghetto superstar
I recall when I couldn't rap, now my rap game's up to par
From then to now it's funny, Jabos to Armani
AP became a business man, that's all about his money

Back in the days I was young, I'm not a kid anymore
But sometimes, I wish that I could be a kid again

Went from bare foot on a bus, to holding keys to Monte Carlos
Now it's a big body Expedition, showing my naked ass provado
Went from hood to all good, shh playing a game like huh brah
Backyard nickel and dime that, now boys be moving birds
Use to carry my knife special, now it's gats and smoking sherm
Use to mix at house parties, freestyling to Whodini
Now I'm signing rappers to paid in full, eating shrimp and fetichini
Boy I use to ride big wheels, while wearing them Chuck Taylors
Now it's Jordans, Air Macs, even pink-green gators
Use to be sneaking in Lover's Land, or at the drive-in movies
Now it's Tinsel Town or Motel 6, where this hoe can do me
Use to watch freestyle the man, or Rap City on BET

Should of seen it I was right there, when a problem jumped off
Rounds got dumped off, leaving niggas bumped off
Always trying to get the hook up, leaving your girl shook up
Women breaking my pager, phone line you can't look up
We had ice on us, merchandise on us
Busting at other hoods, when they had a price on us
Listening to flow tapes, people saying rewind it
Pulling out my piece, and bystanders get blinded
From winter to summer time, there wasn't no leaving our block
When the laws made it hot, we was freezing our block
Man we got enough money, to make my neck look pretty
Cause we done made enough money, to make my check look pretty
Rapping at talent shows, saying phrase too frequent though
Niggas talk about Fasachi, we roll that in Regal though

Dance with me, make me sway
Like the lazy ocean hugs the shore
Hold me close, sway me more

Like a flower bending in the breeze
Bend with me, sway with ease
When we dance, you have a way with me
Stay with me, sway with me

Other dancers may be on the floor
Dear, but my eyes will see only you
Only you have that magic technique
When we sway, I grow weak

I can hear the sound of violins
Long before it begins
Make me thrill as only you know how
Sway me smooth, sway me now

Scott Krippayne,"All who sail the sea of faith
Find out before too long
How quickly blue skies can grow dark
And gentle winds grow strong

Suddenly fear is like white water
Pounding on the soul
Still we sail on knowing
That our Lord is in control

Sometimes He calms the storm
With a whispered peace be still
He can settle any sea
But it doesn't mean He will

Sometimes He holds us close
And lets the wind and waves go wild
Sometimes He calms the storm
And other times He calms His child

He has a reason for each trial
That we pass through in life
And though we're shaken
We cannot be pulled apart from Christ

No matter how the driving rain beats down
On those who hold to faith
A heart of trust will always
Be a quiet peaceful place",Sometimes He Calms the Storm,1995

Remember to let us into your skin
Cause then you'll begin, to master
Rhymin' rhymin' rhymin'

Criminal minded, you've been blinded
Looking for a style like mine you can't find it
They are the audience, I am the lyricist
Sometimes the suckers on the side gotta hear this
Page, a rage, and I'm not in a cage
Free as a bird to fly up out on stage
Ain't here for no fronting just to say a little something
You suckers don't like me cause you're all about nothing
However, I'm really fascinating to the letter
My all-around performance gets better and better
My English grammar comes down like a hammer
You need a style, I need to pull your file
I don't beg favors, you're kissing other people's [ass]
I write and produce myself just as fast
Keep my hair like this, got no time for Jheri curls
Attracting only women, got no time for little girls

Cause girls look so good but their brain is not ready
I don't know
I'd rather talk to a woman cause her mind is so steady
So here we go

I'm not a musical maniac or b-boy fanatic
I simply made use of what was upstairs in the attic
I've listened to these MC's back when I was a kid
But I bust more shots than they ever did
I mean this is not the best of KRS, it's just a section
But how many times must I point you in the right direction
You need protection when I'm on the mic
Because my mouth is like a 9 millimeter windpipe
You're a king, I'm a teacher
You're a b-boy, I'm a scholar
If this was a class, well it would go right under drama
See kings lose crowns but teachers stay intelligent
Talking big words on the mic but still irrelevant
Especially when you're not college material
Wake up every morning to your Lucky Charms cereal
DJ Scott La Rock has a college degree
Blastmaster KRS writes poetry
I won't go deeper in the subject cause that gets me bored
It's a shame to know some MC's on the mic are fraud
Saying styles like this to create a diss
But if you listen, who you dissing?
I am a musician
Rapping on the mic like this to me is fine
Cause if I really want to battle I will put out a nine
You can see that Scott La Rock and I are mentally binded
In other words we're both Criminal Minded

We're not promoting violence, we're just having some fun
He's Scott La Rock, I'm KRS-One
Never off-beat cause it don't make sense
Grab the microphone, relaxed and not tense
You waited, debated, and now you activated
A musical genius that could not be duplicated
See I have the formula for rocking the house
If you cannot rock a party do not open your mouth
It's that simple, no phony cosmetics for your pimple
Take another look because the gear is not wrinkled
The K, the R, the S, the O, the N, the E
Say a rhyme for 87 not no 1983
Well versed, to rehearse, in my rhymes I might curse
Originality is first but the suckers get worse
Allow me to include I have a very stable mood
Poetic education of a high altitude
I'm not an MC, so listen, call me poet or musician
A genius when it comes to making music with ambition
I'm cool, collected with the rhyme I directed
Don't wanna be elected as the king of a record
Just respected by others as the man with the solution
An artist of the 80's came and left his contribution
On wax, relax, there's 24 tracks
After years of rocking parties now I picked up the knack
Because everything that flows from out my larynx
Takes years of experience and bottles of Beck's
I cannot seem to recollect the time I didn't have sex
Is it real or is it Memorex?
I'm living in a city known as New York State
Sucker MC's gotta wait while I translate
I hang with real live dreads with knowledge in their heads
People with ambition and straight up musicians
Although our lives have been so uprooted
I haven't included, you can all get zooted
So take each letter of the KRS-One
Means Knowledge Reigns Supreme Over Nearly Everyone
You look at me and laugh, but this is your class
It's an all-out discussion of the suckers I be crushing
So now you are awakened to the music I be making
Never duplicated, and also highly cultivated
Don't get frustrated cause nothing has been traded
Only activated, it came out very complicated
Not separated, from my DJ
You see my voice is now faded
I'll see you folks around the way

About the the things you said concerning my singing

Oh, you said the top ten billboards, I could break in
Tell me are you for real or just faking?
I grow up and you think the hippies would dig me
I would work on my flow if you thought I had hip-hop in me

To impress the girls I'd work on my sensitivity
As for my debts, who's proud for punk crowd longevity

And if you told me that I could be famous
I present you with a list of changes I could make
We could fake the world out

It's all 'cause of us I'd caused shotgun on the tour bus
Playing every show shirt lest ladies would adore us
Throwing pennies on stage at every single chorus
Then we'd break up the band 'cause all this money bores us

Their watch of wondering love

I am going blind from the dust in my eyes

And I'm coughing up my lungs, but I know I've gotta stay

I'm moving slow with nowhere to go
I stumble on a sign 'One Mile To Dine'
It takes a little time and I'm barely alive
But I make it nonetheless with a shortage of breath

The coffee you poured me is cold
The paper I'm reading is old
And that smile is not your own

The clothes that I wear are soaked through
I'm all out of luck for you
And there's a million things I can't do
Can't do, I can't do

I'm sitting next to the man with the unsteady hands
He says, ""How are you, son, where you been all week?""
I recognize his voice even in my sleep

Lord only knows what I got up to
Maybe it's best for me if I just found my shoes
And confirm my suspicions for heaven's sake
And pick up my trail from my front gate

If you'd just stick around 

I know the shots you call gentle 
'Cause I could fall and break

I read between the lines 
Cuts like a hate crime 
And tell me today's not the day

For I don't care if the world's upside down 
If you're lost or you're found 
I know my feet will stay far from the ground

Just to taste our love again, 
Afraid of some break-up

Empty rooms without your love.

Every thing there was dark and dirty
Outside my window was a steeple
With a clock that always said 12:30

Young girls are coming to the canyon
And in the morning I can see them walking
I can no longer keep my blinds drawn
And I cant keep myself from talking.

At first so strange to feel so friendly
To say good morning and really mean it
To feel these changes happening in me
But not to notice till I feel it.

And in the morning I can see them walking

And lie there shattered into fragments.

And I was raised by the graves

I wore my brother's clothes because our house - it was cold
With a cry of ""pennies make dollars""
And we settled down so far from that town
That God only knows if you holler
And on the back of the farm there was an old graveyard
Where I used to play as a child
And I was raised by the graves

And I married a woman a lot like my mom, and I act a lot like my daddy

And I had found the truth
The wild things grow

The softest touch of skin, the holy world unfolds
Till death, I promise all I have, this new discovered path
Where the wild things grow, we'll stay

Well sin, original or not
And not if you get caught, can scar your very soul
The gift that the pain and pleasure, bring make you silently sing
When the wild things grow

A voice, I've never heard before
The begging for some more, some kind of problem grown
The noise of the dying being choked, the makers name invoked

I gotta loosen her up or she ain't never gonna let me in.

To a hard-headed man who had the good luck to marry a decent man's daughter
And from my earliest days I could tell things were bad
President's - they were resigning
And I was raised by the graves

I wore my brother's clothes because our house - it was cold
With a cry of ""pennies make dollars""
And we settled down so far from that town
That God only knows if you holler
And on the back of the farm there was an old graveyard
Where I used to play as a child
And I was raised by the graves

Well, I struck out at home, and I went on my own into a world that has already passed me
And I married a woman a lot like my mom, and I act a lot like my daddy

Heating rations on the manifold

Of jerry cans in back

""Fuck the men, they can eat their belts
But the tanks - they must have gas.""

Cause I’m running to the fire now,

Now that my scars have gone away.
Don’t open them back up today,
I can’t take the pain
And the white noise calms me down at night.

It’s no fun when it’s your life,
Hanging on the line

But somehow, those memories never fade.
As I look at these photographs,

So I say it to myself
I’ve lost my way
I’m someone else

I ran too fast.
Living in a moment never meant to last.
I should’ve known better than that

Got lost in the masquerade

Now I’m crossing bridges that I’ve burned.

To walk the line down a crooked lane
Fell off the road to heaven,
To a world of hurt

Through the stain glass windows of where I've been.
Some parts holy. Some parts dark as sin.
The time has come to take off my mask.
Watch the scars spill secrets from my past.

What I thought was all of my life story.
Turns out it was only just one page.
It's a new beginning, I have got so much left to say.

I'm dying to breathe in every moment.
I’m dying to make up for lost time.
I’m dying to let go and finally feel what real love is.
I'm dying to live.

when they have always been right in front of me.

40 nights it poured.
I can't take it anymore,
It's getting overboard.
I lean forward.
Wandered through mountains,
Ran through valley's so low.
Been down the road less traveled,
A million times before.
Went through hell to find my heaven,
Crossing up my lines.
Went through hell to find my heaven,
Fighting for my life.

10 floors down,
I dove into the night.
The stars were in my eyes, I scream,
Come on hit me more.
Broken by the sound.
Blinded by the light.

Come on hit me more

Come on, what you waiting for?
Is that all you got?
Come on hit me more.

Burn my skin,
Reign down fire,
Come on bring it again.

And then he drank with people you and me would just cast aside
He did his people good. Just like he said he would.
And in the blink of an eye, he gave a blind man sight

His roar was lions in the night
When he spoke he always drew a crowd
His message was his lifestyle
He gave us everything and more
He was the party we’ve been looking for
Maybe, just maybe…. Jesus was rockstar!

that he gave his only begotten Son,
that whosoever believeth in him,
should not perish,
but have everlasting life.
For God sent not his Son into the world,
to condemn the world;
but that the world through him,
might be saved.
