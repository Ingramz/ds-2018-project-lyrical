Dashboard Confessional,"You called to say you wanted out.
Well, I can't say I blame you now.
Sometimes you've got to fold
Before you're found out.
Well thanks for waiting this long 
To show yourself.

'Cause now that I can see you,
I don't think you're worth a second glance.

So much for all the promises you made,
They served you well.
Now you're gone and they're wasted on me.

So much for your endearing sense of charm,
It served you well.
Now you've gone and they're wasted on me.

I guess that all you've got
Is all you're gonna get.",Rapid Hope Loss,2003
Dashboard Confessional,"Pacific sun, you should have warned us, it gets so cold here.
And the night can freeze, before you set it on fire.

And our flares go unnoticed.
Diminished, faded just as soon as they are fired.

We are, we are, intrigued. We are, we are, invisible.

Oh, how we've shouted, how we've screamed,
Take notice, take interest, take me with you.

But all our fears fall on deaf ears.

Tonight, they're burning the roads they built to lead us to the light.
And blinding our hears with their shining lies,
While closing our caskets cold and tight. But I'm dying to live.

Pacific sun, you should have warned us, these heights are dizzying,
And the climb can kill you long before the fall.

And our trails go unmarked and unmapped and covered
Just as soon as they are crossed.

We are, we are, intriguing. We are, we are, desirable.

Oh how we've shouted, how we've screamed,
Take notice, take interest, take me with you.

But all our fears fall on deaf ears.

Tonight, they're burning the roads they built to lead us to the light.
And blinding our hearts with their shining lies,
While closing our caskets cold and tight. But I'm dying to live.",Several Ways to Die Trying,2003
Dashboard Confessional,"I heard that you were home again,
But you don't look like you're back to me.
With your focuses changing,
Your gaze is transfixed on
A point that I can't often see.

You've got your new ties. I've got my old knots.
You've got your inside line.
But you're never happy with what you've got.

Careful now, you're so beautiful
When you've convinced yourself
That no one else is quite as beautiful.

I heard that you were living well,
But you don't look like you're living to me.
Though the sparkle is gone, your smile is in place,
So that everyone watching will see.
You've got them all convinced.

But I know so well that you could list your friends, 
But you can't count on them.

Hold it now, you've got everyone convinced
That you're alright
When no one else is quite as vulnerable.

As soon as you've got it you want something else.
It's not the sale that you love, it's the sell.
It's not the price, that's gonna cost you,
It's just the weight, that's gonna bring you down.

Hold it now, you've got everyone convinced
That you're alright
When no one else is quite as vulnerable.

Careful now, you're so beautiful 
When you've convinced yourself 
That no one else is quite as beautiful.

As soon as you've got it, 
You want something else.
It's not the sale that you love, it's the sell.

It's not the price, that's gonna cost you,
It's just the weight that's gonna bring you down.",So Beautiful,2003
Dashboard Confessional,"I catalog these steps now
Decisive and intentioned
Precise and patterned specifically to yours.
I'm talented at breathing
Especially exhaling
So that my chest will rise and fall with yours

I'm careful not to wake you
Fearing conversation
It's better just to hold you
And keep you pacified
I'm talented with reason
I cover all the angles
I can fail before I ever try

Try to understand there's an old mistake that fools will make
And I'm the king of them, pushing everything that's good away
Wont you hold me now (I will not bend I will not break)
Wont you hold me now (I will not bend I will not break)

I am fairly agile
I can bend and not break
Or I can break and take it with a smile
And I am so resilient
I recover quickly
I'll convince you soon that I am fine

Try to understand there's and old mistake that fools will make
And I'm the king of them, pushing everything that's good away
Wont you hold me now (I will not bend I will not break)
Wont you hold me now (For you I rise, for you I fall)

Just hold me close to you, just hold me close to you
Just hold me close to you, just hold me close to you, to you

And try to understand there's and old mistake that fools will make

Dashboard Confessional,"I was away for a while
But I'm hoping someday you'll forgive me
Though I don't deserve it
I'll cherish it well if you give me one of your new starts

Just one more last chance
I swear that I'll earn it
If you front me for now
I'm good for it, I swear
I'm better now, I swear

In earlier days, they'd persecute people
They'd carry them off and hobble their legs
For lesser offenses, than how I have harmed you
And still you allow me to walk free of pain

Though I punish myself, I will never settle
The debts I've incurred for scorning the face
Of absolute beauty and measureless grace

And though I once mocked you
I'm dying to pay for it now
I'm dying to pay for it now

So hand me the rocks to help weigh me down
And tether my legs with a cord tightly bound
To the end of an anchor thrown into the sound
And test me to see if I will rise against the worst that it can get

I wasn't well for a while, I savored the things
That I knew were sure to destroy me
And that seemed to hold me
That seemed to carry me where I couldn't go

On the strength of my own
Well, I should've known
That gets me nowhere
I've learned that now I swear

In earlier days, they'd persecute people
They'd carry them off and hobble their legs
For lesser offenses, than how I have harmed you

Dashboard Confessional,"Well, I've been bleeding well from this old wound
Cleaning it with salt, so it will still feel new
And sometimes eyes turn black and sometimes scars are tracks
But every time you're gone, I wish that you'd come back

And everyone watched me waste myself
And everyone cheered at last
And all of them found it comforting
It's better it's me, than them

I think I'm doing well from what they say
They've taken both my belt and shoelaces away
Well I believe in luck, I think I do
Well, I'd believe for sure, if ever I saw you

Well, I've been fanning flames from these old coals
Feeding them with tinder and hoping they will grow
Well, I've been savoring what I can't hold

The day is long and here for us to take for granted 
We find ourselves to our knees the water clear the tender breeze upon our faces as we bask in our good graces 

Yeah we all are golden here

In Summer , In Summer 
Where night belongs to lust and lovers 
In Summer , In Summer 
And I am here to win you over 
You will be mine this year 

The sun is the set and the moon is high the night is long and here for you and I to capture 
We Float ourselves to the coast with icy drinks that boast our wills 
And we are braver for the moment 

Yeah we all are golden here 

In Summer , In Summer 
Where all the girls bear olive shoulders
In Summer , In Summer 
And I am here to win you over 
You will be mine this year 

The courtyard wear the garden stands beyond the beach the crystal sands 
We shed our clothes and felt romantic 
Tempted by the moon fantastic 
Bright and Warm and ours alone 
Absolve of us the sins we own 
And from one year to another 
I think of you when I feel summer 

In Summer , In Summer 
Where all the girls bear olive shoulders 
In Summer , In Summer 
When all you hope for is another 
In Summer , In Summer 
Where night belongs to lust and lovers

Dashboard Confessional,"When the day is long and the night
The night is yours alone
When you're sure you've had enough
Of this life to  hang on

Don't let yourself go
'Cause everybody cries
Everybody hurts sometimes

Sometimes everything is wrong
Now it's time to sing along
When your day is night alone
If you feel like letting go
When you think you've had too much
Of this life, to hang on

'Cause everybody hurts
Take comfort in your friends
And everybody hurts

Don't throw your hand
Oh no, don't throw your hand
If you feel like you're alone
No, no, no, you're not alone

If you're on your own in this life
And the days and nights are long
When you think you've had too much
Of this life, to hang on

Everybody hurts, sometimes everybody cries
And everybody hurts sometimes
And everybody hurts sometimes
So hold on, hold on, hold on
Hold on, hold on, hold on

Dashboard Confessional,"She said I've gotta be honest
You're wasting your time if you're fishing round here
And I said you must be mistaken
I'm not fooling this feeling is real
She said you gotta be crazy
What do you take me for some kind of easy mark
You've got wits, you've got looks
You've got passion, but I swear that you've got me all wrong

All wrong
All wrong
But you got me

I'll be true, I'll be useful
I'll be cavalier I'll be yours my dear
And I'll belong to you
If you'll just let me through
This is easy as lovers go
So don't complicate it by hesitating
And this is wonderful as loving goes
This is tailor-made, what's the sense in waiting

And I said I've gotta be honest
I've been waiting for you all my life
For so long I thought I was asylum bound
But just seeing you makes me think twice
And being with you here makes me sane
I fear I'll go crazy if you leave my side
You've got wits you've got looks
You've got passion but are you brave enough to leave with me tonight

Tonight
Tonight
But you've got me

I'll be true, I'll be useful
I'll be cavalier I'll be yours my dear
And I'll belong to you

And this is wonderful as loving goes

Dashboard Confessional,"The air is visible around you, rising up and off your lips in slow currents
And I watch as your face is framed in its slow currents
Drifting curls a trailing path
A long drag becomes a dress of blue and ash

If it is born in flames then we should let it burn
Burn as brightly as we can
And if its gotta end then let it end in flames
Let it burn all the way down

The air is visceral around us
Turning in its simple steps on slow currents
And I watch as it pirouettes and spins in slow motion
A long drag becomes a slow dance and a halo around her

If it is born in flames then we should let it burn
Burn as brightly as we can
And if its gotta end then let it end in flames
Let it burn all the way down
All the way down

And if this is ever meant to end, then I hope it ends where it began
So hot with love we burned our hands
If this is ever meant to end then I hope it ends where it began
So hot with love, it burns our hands

To let your armor down
To let your armor down

A bit to early for my own good

Dashboard Confessional,"She smiled in a big way, the way a girl like that smiles
When the world is hers and she held your eyes
Out in the breezeway down by the shore in the lazy summer
And she pulled you in, and she bit your lip, and she made you hers
She looked deep into you as you lay together quiet in the grasp of dusk and summer

But you've already lost
But you've already lost
But you've already lost
When you only had barely enough to hang on

And she combed your hair, and she kissed your teeth
And she made you better than you'd been before
She told you bad things you wished you could change in the lazy summer
And she told you, laughing down to her core, so she would not cry as she lay in your lap
She said ""Nobody here can live forever, quiet in the grasp of dusk and summer""

But you've already lost
But you've already lost
But you've already lost
When you only had barely enough to hang on

I can feel them on my teeth, upon my lips and in my chest
I can roll them on my tongue, they are more subtle than defeat

All lace in secret places, she moves you to touch with her hands

Seh’ ich mehr als die andern? Hab’ ich Byakugan?
Oder denken alle andern einfach lieber nicht nach?
Fucking frustrier’nd wie die Gier, wie der Hass
Wie dieses verdammte Verlangen nach Macht
Warum verfallen sie alle dem Guap?
Warum sind so viele in ihr Ego verliebt?
Warum ist die Demokratie keine Demokratie?
Und warum haben nicht alle Wesen ein Leben verdient?
Es fuckt, fuckt, fuckt, fuckt, fuckt mich einfach nur ab
Dass dieser Planet leidet im selben Moment, in dem ich hier sitz, um diesen Text zu schreiben
Es fuckt noch mehr ab, wenn ich wieder merk’, dass ich ’nen Jannik entflamm’, yeah
Nur weil ich all diesen Shit nicht anders verarbeiten kann, yeah
Und schon wieder bin ich so down
Diese Scheiße kreist in meinem Mind und ich krieg’ sie nicht mehr da raus
Und höre jetzt schon „Bla, bla, bla abgedroschene Gesellschaftskritik!“

We're left here to cope
With the fact that we can't find a role
Thrown through the conscience we're in, all alone
No one to guide our way",Waves,2018

You got g's man please
I'm overseas
I got the beats to keep you blowing on trees
Keep them hoes on they knees
I'm as cold as Mr. Freeze
Making music in this game
Like flipping coke into ki's
Everyday is the same when I'm rolling on chop
Got a cop on my left so I'm riding non-stop
Till I die
I'ma win 
See it's time to make ends
Thinking bout how I'ma make it so I'm sitting on rims
20 inches on chop
Hit the scene on the lean
Burban clean
6 screens
Biscuit tucked at the seams
Make my dreams so real
Plot to make a mil
Let these haters know the way a player really fells
When I'm rollin' g
Shit!
I'm never gonna quit
Bout to hit the switch
So I can dip on the strip
Pull in sideways than I cock it on 3
Everybody stop and stare cause they all want to see how we

Let's flip to the club and try to find some sex
See when I'm rollin' in my ride

Got rocks in my watch
I'm sideways on mine
Finna hit the Marriot
I done dodged the cops
I broke em off by the lot
Glock 17 shots
When I punch in the clock
Switching lanes on the main
Crunk the bang when I feel
Wood grain wood strips
Bezatines smoking dip
On the interstate
As I hit the pancake
Sipping on the 8
Straight as I break my scrape plate
Keep my ride up to date
Flipping 20's when I say
""It's that throwed ese on the grind movin weight""
Pull out the shades
Shining down my blades
Today's a sunny day
And there's money to be made
It's that 7 1 trey
Pulling out the Escalade
Creased up with them dames
And a bald fade

Out-Rage-ous, vindictive... conspicuous 
All about it, got to have it 
The big bo-ty girl 

You don't know what you in store for 
Rough, rugged, and raw (raw hardcore) 
Rough, rugged, and raw (raw) 

Hey yo Robin (whassup?) I feel like squabbin (what?) 
And if you wit me (uh-huh) I know that you're mobbin (c'mon)

Ahh, kick shit off so tight, kick rhymes 
I kick real shit when I recite 
The poetry lethal as ?Moe Brown? 
I got you hoppin with a new sound 
Dat Nigga Daz showin up to put it down 
Who's the example, who tried to come and make my fear 
MC's come around and kick the shit that's real 
KnowhatImean? Get steamed, the pressure in, to the extreme 
It ain't a dream, real shit from real MC's 
I can't complain or explain it I run you over like a train 
Bang and hang, box rhyme skate, then swang 
It ain't a thang, cover quarter artificial rappers 
be	-boys and MC's, what's happenin 
Check it, tell me, nuthin could save ya 
You better watch out, cause nuthin could save ya 
I blast you lay you down surround you with the hypnotical sound 
The Lady of Rage and the Pound for life 
I keep it underground, no matter where I'm from 
I keep it real with a sound, you better watch it 
for the battleground, for instance, I spray your 
whole god damn crew put you out of commission, fool listen 
Wise up and pay attention, and take heed 
til you get driven, into the floor 
until you don't want no more, I can't stop repeatedly 
You heard shots (pop pop pop) turn on the six o'clock 
and who'd you see, who I popped, is it you? Or is it him? 
Is it one of your parents, is it your friend? 

Rough, rugged, and raw (hardcore) 
Rough, rugged, and raw, hah (hardcore) 
Rough, rugged, and raw (hardcore) 
Rough, rugged, and raw 

Now check this 
The key in the game is to be in the game 
It's all about the fortune, motherfuck the game 
It's not the same, I ain't tryin to make me no names 
Live on stage, it's the Lady of Rage, I don't 
follow no fads, the Lady of Rage is bad 
Bad down to the marrow keep your eyes on the sparrow 
Pure raw rough rugged and hardcore, Robin's on the soar 
The deadliest to take flight 
The bomb rhyme condor, rhyme conniseur in my castle 
You don't want no hastle, you don't want to battle 
Skeedaddle, be on your merry way (cause what?) 
Cause on this very day you're Going Down like Mary J. 
Whip you like cream it's the cream of the crop, the top notch 
to win the wars without tecs and glocks, Rage rocks 
Always and forever to the casket bruh 
All up in that ass til you had enough 

'Cause she's the queen of the hip-hop game, you know her name 
She sent on a mission so I gots to handle things 
I can't let her down, I gots to represent the Pound 
With the hardco' rough rugged, for yo' nugget 
You love it, you dug it 
The shit on tape young nigga, so hurry up and dub it 
Hey yo Robin (whassup?) I feel like squabbin (what?) 
So if you're wit me (uh-huh) I know that you're mobbin (c'mon) 
It ain't no thing (uh-huh) it ain't no problem (uhh, and if it was) 
Uhh, you know that we could solve em 

Now everytime I step into a room, KA-BOOM!! 
Here comes the heavyweight masha, in any shape form or fashion 
Rip the roof off the mother kick the frame out this fucker (hayyyy!) 
Cause Rage shit, pops with extra butter 
Hotter than the 4th of July, I tell you no lie 
Til the, uhh, day I die, I be fly Robin fly 
Smackin with the swiftness, witness this comin 
I'm wipin suckers out, so you can call me ahh the clean up woman 
But I gots, better things to do like making, cheddar with my crew 
Like shaking and baking rookies like cookies and umm veterans too 
I got beaucoup flow, who you know that can go toe to toe 
I'm the heavyweight champ, hah, you'll get stamped 
Send it, I'm hittin hard enough to dent this, I'm relentless 
I leave your whole camp tentless, so bow down in repentance 
or pay the Price like Vincent, smack that ass like infants

I have no remorse cause I'm the fucking murderer
Haven't you ever heard of a killer?
I drop bombs like Hiroshima
So now I walk around strapped

Dat Nigga Daz,"You find an MC like me who's strong
Leaving motherfucker's aborted, with no verbal support
And when I command the microphone I get deadly as Kahn though
With a bear and a snake and a panda, I'm on those
Who can withstand, the more power I gain
And make it possible for me to drop a few to wreck your brain
Imagine and keep on wishing upon a star
Finally realizing who the fuck we are
When I penetrate, it's been withstanding, faded
Would it be the greatest MC of all time
When I created rhyme for the simple fact
When I attack I crush your pride
My intention to ride, every time all night
I'm faced with the scars beyond this one bar
For me to put down my guard, I'm faced with it, I'm a ride
Breaking in gas with the six-eight all day
In and out with my pay
I'm soon to count the bodies

So mandatory my elevation my lyrics like orientation
So you can be more familiar with the nigga you facing
We must be patient nothing better than communication
Known to damage and highly flammable like gas stations
Sorry I left that ass waiting
No more procrastination give up to fate, and get that ass shaking
I'm busting and making motherfuckers panic
Don't take your life for granted put that ass in the dirt
You swear the bitch was planted
My lyrics motivate the planet
It's similar to Rhythm Nation
But thugged out, forgive me Janet
Who's in control I'm activating your souls
You know, the way the games get controlled
You, two years ago, a friend of mine
Told me Alize and Cristal blows your mind
Bear witness to the dopest fucking rhyme I wrote
Taking off my coat, clearing my throat

I got my mind made up, come on (come on)
Get in get in too (get on it)
Let it ride (get wit it) tonight's the night
I got my mind made up, come on
Get in get in too
Let it ride tonight's the night

Well I come through with two packs
Of the bomb prophalaks for protection
So my fucking sac won't collapse
Cause nowadays, shit's evading the x-rays
Sending young motherfuckers to an early grave
I wonder, if my terrifying tactics of torturing MC's
Shows my heart's as cold as the tundra
Electrifying like thunder, I'm just too much
Rough and raw with that motherfucking poisonous touch
I'm an MC with lyrics that's the fucking bom-bay
Your got dissed, that's before it's ingest like balmay
My rhymes, I leave a mark on your mind
As the deadly vibes spread through your head like sand pine
There's no escape, nah I ain't blasting
I use my mental to assassinate assassin's for those asking
Opposed to laughing, raw maniacal villain
Laughter enhances the chances of the killing
Why is that? 'cause smiling faces deceive
You best believe, to MC's I'm the deadliest disease
My thoughts rip your throat and make it hard to breathe
Your whole camp's under seige, and I'm Jason Vorhees
In the heat of the night is when I defeat and ignite mikes
My verbal snipe, your vocab on site
I'm out the cut, uncut and raw with no clause for all
So all my rhymes hit and split the bricks on the wall
Your already have an idea about the superior sphere
The greater rhyme creator on both sides of the equator
I rock from here to there, to Philly and back
To LA on the spot where I rock and bust like straps
As your views get overshadowed when you come in contact
Beware, set and prepare to enter verbal combat

Fuck you losers, while you fake jacks I makes maneuvers
Like Hitler, sticking up (Jews) with German (lugers)
The Mr. Meth-Tical from Staten Isle
Will be back after this mess-age don't touch the dial
Rarely do you see an MC out for justice
Got my gun powder and my musket blow!
Melons get swellings, I paint mental pictures like Magellen
Half of my Clan's three deep felons
Niggas best protect they joints for Nine-Nickel
Man I stay on point like icicles
Now who wanna test Tical then touch Tical
All up in your motherfucking mouth
Head banger boogie
Catch me on tour with Al Doogie
Method Man roll too tight, you can pull me
Better take one and pass or that's that ass
Your vital statistics are low and falling fast
Johnny Blaze out to get loot like Johnny Cash
Play a game of Russian Roulette and have a blast

Hey yo, lyrical gas spitting the criminal tactics
Non-believers get my dick and genitals backwards
Let's face it, there's no replacement
Taste this, mad underground basement, shit I'm laced with
Avalanche on your whole camp when I'm splifted
Funk Doctor who? Spock bitch don't get it twisted
I got connects like Federal Express
To get the fresh package of bless, the dogs can't fetch
Got the clear spot from the rear block
To bust till every nigga here drop, men I fear not
Hold your nose and blow out till your ears pop
Since your crew suit you to shift now you claim that you get's lot
With, this underground cannabis
I'm dangerous like John the bomb analyst
Then proceeds like keys
My degrees freeze consecutively like EPMD LP's
Lick off a shot and hit your fam' by mistake
So I erase the whole front row at the wake
I planned my escape in case Jake or a snake bust it
I'm the one pushing the hearse in the first place
Confidence for you shaky ass folks
Pump for Rockafella for the day he got smoked
Choke, off this anecdote got you ope
Get roast, by my lyrics Billy Dee .45 Colt

You find an MC like me who's strong
Leavin motherfucker's aborted, with no verbal support
And when I command the microphone I gets deadly as Kahn though
With a bear and a snake and a panda, I'm on those 
Who can withstand, the mo' power I gain
and make it possible for me to drop a few to wreck ya brain
Imagine and keep on wishin upon a star
Finally realizing who the fuck we are
When I penetrate, it's been withstandin, faded
would it be the greatest MC of all time
When I created rhyme for the simple fact
When I attack I crush your pride
My intention to ride, every time all night
I'm faced with the scars beyond this one bar

Dat Nigga Daz,"It's 12.30 AM, Christmas Eve
I'm out with the gangstas and thieves
Celebratin', postin' up with eggnog [head up up] in my cup
[Put Rudolph and Moses] lil' bang-bangin' and coastin'
Down the block but be careful for the heart, because it's posted'
Some stay to this day that Christmas ain't nothing but another day
But, out of respect, I gotta give the Lord his day
Tell me, tell me, where do the homies and bums got to sleep? {Nowhere}
Where do hungry and the needy-greedy's got to eat? {But who cares?}
Life is so crucial and cold, [it's worse] for the children
In this world they hopes and dreams can't afford
The young and old churches and spiritual dreams, seasonal things
Heard throughout the ghetto reaches gangstas and dope-fiends, huh
Cause those who ain't able get it now can finally get it
Cause the ghetto Santa Claus has sprinkled the hood and now we ballin'
Livin' to a new year of better thangs
Celebrate it with some Champagne, ha ha, check it

Santa Claus is coming straight to the ghetto

Now on the first day of Christmas, my homeboy gave to me
A sack of the krazy glue and told me to smoke it up slowly
Now on the second day of Christmas, my homeboy gave to me
A fifth of Hendog and told me to take my mind off that weed
Now by the third day of Christmas, my big homeboy gave to me
A whole lot of everything, and it wasn't nuthin' but game to me

Back then, you woke up to the sound of ""I Saw Mama Kissing Santa""
Made you remenisce on the old fashion Christmas days
Gifts, miss a fat man jolly with joy
Down ya chimney with toys for lil' girls and boys
Pumped up, I jumped up before the sun peeped in
And hoped to catch a Santa Claus creepin' down my hall
Ran to the window, put my eyes to the sky
To see if I could see the sleigh that parlayed and pushed a fat guy
I sigh, ain't no sign, but everything under this tree in my house is mine
My bike, that, and this plastic nine'll do fine till next year come
I try to see the same thing, they got us brain washed dumb
And when you find, it ain't no Santa, Christmas still mean a lot
Cause it's the time to get together and give all you got
You got food, good moods, and what's better than together with your people
When wishers give a toast by the tree, it's Merry Christmas

Santa Claus is coming straight to the ghetto

Santa Claus on the ceiling, Jack Frost chillin'
Pinch the Grinch for being a holiday villain
Season's greetings, all the proceedings
Are brought to you by the church house where we'll be eatin'
Chestnuts roastin' on an open fire
Singin' my jingle, where is Kris Kringle
I didn't pop, I ain't even shout
I even stayed in the house, where the homies tried to sneak me out
And all I want for Christmas is my 6-4 Chevrolet
And a granddaughter for her grandmother Beverly
Ain't that somethin'? Nah, ain't that nothin'
How it's Christmas time and my rhyme's steady bumpin'
Everybody happy, hair still nappy
Gonna steal a gift for my old grandpappy
Catch me giving out turkeys at the church-house
Don't try to work me, just stand in the line and everything gon' be fine
Holla at ya folks, boy, it's goin' down
Ain't no help from no elves, just Tha Dogg Pound
And we passin' out gifts, blazin' up spliffs
Christmas on the Row, can you dig it? {can you dig it}

Santa Claus is coming straight to the ghetto

Christmas Eve, by the leaves, every 6 with the year
Girls and boys full off joy with the season cheer
Smell the sky, hella pies and cakes gettin' baked
To be ate after everything gone off your plate
But wait, not tonight it's straight beans and rice
On the table, are we able to proceed tonight?
I wonder what the morn's bringin' so it's hard to doze off
Three 'o clock in my socks I crack the dope song
Hopin' when I open the door I'll see Santa
Now who the hell is this in this blue bandana
Messin' with the boxes that's up under the three
Look like Santa Claus been crossed to a woman to me
Now I'm comin' to see, the whole picture gettin' clearer
How we have messed I says best get nearer
Mirror, mirror, please, it's seemed I've be deceived
And thank the same trick for the gifts I receive
So I creep back, and act like I ain't even peeped it
This'll be me and Mom's private secret

Yeah
Vision 88 kilos of cocaine smack-dead in your face
The street value of that is what you dream to make
Run an illegal business, racketeering
Smuggling, doing things from handing a gun,is what they fearing
Bodyguards and hitmen like some Al Capone shit
Heavy artillery got the cops on my dick
Different locations,spots where it takes place
If you show them my money, your ass is getting f-laid
There's four major games that run the city of G's
The violators, the Gambinos and the Corleones and me
The violators and Gambinos they run uptown
Me and my cousin Corleone we run downtown
Murder's an everyday thing in the city
Where you gotta plot chips,jag robberies and do in its
Tanadian Nay,the charge of the weapons
Hit from verandahs and do a thing unexpected
So we plan a plot with an Uzi and 10 shot
Buck em till they all drop,circle round the block
Let em have it as soon as they come out
Unload on their ass,commence to taking them out!

[Daz]
Throughout the streets of Long Beach
The streets was infected with drugs,dope pealers and addicts
Gangs have taken over 75% of our town as the young
youth behavior is outrageous with crime
They feel no remorse whatsoever, as the law enforcements
have tried to stop the trafficking of drugs
from coming into our country, but they can't
The murders have increased more than 95% and the drug amount
of which they make is more than 700 million dollars
Now wanted by the IRS and we will convict them of tax evasion

[Tray Dee]
I had no choice or remorse for time for putting it down
Niggas know the scoop is stupid if they come from my town
I been around since the Jumpstreet making it pop
Young crook keeping hook, nigga, shaking the spot
Had to be a standout not to get ran out
Look for help,you help yourself 'cause there's no handout
Since the city Long Beach is only G's and hos
You hold on ya heat but them fiendish foes
Trust, bust, be aware and I ain't ya curse
Cause the niggas that I dared to ""agank"" the first
Think I might be deceased 'fore I reach my calling
As long as I'm hauling my heat I'm stalling
I bring it to ya hard from the streets of life
Where niggas get rewarded to grief for strikes
Don't speak on the creep,mo' fools is listening
And war story glory ain't worth the risking
Real niggas still get a mob like respect
If you represent ya set, till ya bite the deck
Who I be?I'm the Dee, nigga check the file
Under G you will see not to sweat my style
I'm taking em out!

[Snoop Dogg]
I come through blasting, me as a Downtown Assassin
Mashing, may they rest in peace in they caskets
Shoot em down in front of Hassans
Should've known from the gate,who's the baddest?
In my zone, Don Corleone wanted
For the murder of forty men
Ordered to hit and watch him kill again and again
From the you-S-see, I shift ki's,a 120 plane rides
Multiplied by G's, 87.3 million in a matter o'months
Big business and big dollars is all that I want
I blaze up to celebrate,new empire to make
Toast till we all die, till we burst and break
From knives to guns, from the rich to the slums   
We ran outta dope, I don't think so son
While I be gunned by a mark from the enemy park
From daylight to reach dark and all the clucks a'spark
From when I pick em off like darts
Stab em in they hearts
Make an example, what I said,ya end up dead
Spayed the wall with graffiti like hogs for all my lost Doggs
Never reach until I see the blue sky till I die
All I ever want is to be left alone
Me myself, me my dope, me and my chrome

When me and Snoop was kids we always knew this kid named Tommy
His parents died left him with gangit kinds of money
But Tommy was a hustler from around the way
Stayed on the northside of town, is where he say

He payed attention to whatever, they was games so clever
If the situation was bad it can only get better
He ran around the dope house

[Snoop Dogg (Daz)]
So he put us up on his scheme
He knew that we was riders so he wanted us on his team
(Uh, poor Tommy)
Get you money, size team (uh)

Get you money man

Get you money man (Poor Tommy)
Get you money man (Me and Snoop on his team)

(Get paid) Gotta have that money man (get you money man)
Get you money man (Get you money man)

[Snoop Dogg]
Tommy was a rider, big money
Tommy had everything, it wasn't funny
All the younger G's used to look up to him
But there was no way, that the bigger ones could do him

They would try him, try him, everytime he was slick
But he never would slip, he always had his grip
And if he did, he'd get away 'cause he was just to fast
Homie up Tommy, Tommy, Tommy's out to mash

Get it, get it, get it, 'cause ya gotta have it
And when ya get make sure ya grab it and stab it
Maintain it, brain it, the way you got's to

No names involved when that nigga caught a slug
Tommy told us forget it, that he's always down wit us
The problems of the murder will be acquitted (young nigga)

[Snoop Dogg]
Now word on the streets is that Machine Gun Tommy,
Ridin' on big ballers for a pastime hobby
So if ya havin' money, and ya smoke big weed
First thing ya need is a security team

And we provide, or should I say we ride for Tommy
My compadre, and if he say ""spray em"", we spray
So I suggest, you get with the 'PG,
or find yourself layin six feet dizzy

[Daz (Snoop Dogg)]
We was down with big Tommy
(get you money man.. get you money man.. get you money man)
On the streets doing his thang, gettin paid
(get you money man.. get you money man..)

(get you money man.. get you money man..)
We was down with big Tommy
(get you money man.. get you money man.. get you money man)
Me and Snoop still on his team, big pimps gettin paid
We was down with big Tommy

(get you money man.. get you money man.. get you money man)
We was down with big Tommy
(get you money man.. get you money man..)
Check me out now man

[Daz]
We had money, jewelry and expensive cars
Niggas who didn't know us, finally know who we are
We was important to the neighborhood like presidents and mass,
Everytime he do a lick he break us off our proper share

A couple of days Tommy was on top of the world
Threw a party with the homies, invited gangs of girls

[Snoop Dogg]
Yeah, it was off the hook you know
We had everything from Indo to blow (What, you sniff blow?)
Oh hell no, I got my whole life ahead of me, no time to be sniffin'
If Tommy find out, boy he'll be trippin'

So I stay A-Ok, but anyway
Tommy got somethin' to say, to say, to say...

[Tommy talking]
Aye look here mayne,
What some people won't do for money
Yea I had these two niggas that was on my team
You know, down with me like the Grey Tape

It's always the niggas that's closest to ya,
That be the ones that try to get you, you know what I'm sayin'
Shit I heard these ladies the other day say that pimpin' was dead
I said not in my bed bitch 

Ah-ha, that's real, I'll put that on my fiz-sound
I'm a pimp 'til I die, 'cause I represent the big,
as well as the small ha-ha

Dat Nigga Daz,"Wake up, jumped out my bed
Hung in a 2 man cell wit my homie Lil 1/2 Dead
Murder was the case that they gave me
Dear God, I wonder can you save me
I'm only 18, so I'm a young buck
It's a ride, if I don't scrap, I'm getting stuck
But that's the life of a G, I guess
Ese's way deep, shanked two in they chest
Bests run 'cause brothers is dropping quicker
Ugh, too late, damn, down goes another nigga
Bouncing off the walls, throwing them dogs
Getting a rep as a young hog
It ain't nothing like the street life
Betta be strapped wit yo shank, 'cause ain't no fist fight
So I guess I gots to handle mine
Since I did the crime, I gots ta do my time

Lil' ghetto boy
Playing in the ghetto streets
What'cha gonna do when you grow up
And have to face responsibility

Now, I'm holding a dove, sitting on swoll
27 years old, up for parole, stroll
I'm back up on my feet wit my mind on the money
That I'm making as soon as I touch the street
Things done changed on this side
Remember they used to thump but now they blast, right
But it ain't no thing to me
'Cause now I'm what they call a loced-assed O.G.
The little homies from the hood wit grip
Are the ones I get with cause I'm down to set-trip
Nigga, I'm bigger than you, so what ya want to do
Didn't know we had a 22
Straight sitting behind his back
I'm grab his pockets and then I heard six caps
I fell to the ground wit blood on my hands
I didn't understand
How a nigga so young could bust a cap
I use to be the same way back
I guess that's what I get (for what)
For trying to jack them little homies for they bread

Lil' ghetto boy
Playing in the ghetto streets
What'cha gonna do when you grow up
And have to face responsibility

Something for the real OG's to get wit
Some facts, made our made, now you want to run and play
Like every single day, really doe
You know me, I'm the smooth macadamia, gaming them for my homie
No need to be uncalm if you pack right
And learning just enough to keep your sack right
Late nights, I wonder what they getting fo'
Early morning on the corners, what they hitting fo'
Seven young G's put they serve down
In a jeep ride, east side what they swerve now
Not thinking about what's really going on
Got crept on, stepped on, now they gone
I spent 4 years in the county wit nutting but convicts around me
But now I'm back at the pound
And we expose ways for the youth to survive
Some think it's wrong but we tend to think it's right
So make all them ends you can make
'Cause when you're broke, you break, check it out
So ain't no need for your mama to trip
'Cause you's a hustling ass youngsta, clocking your grip

Bitches ain't shit but hoes and tricks

Get's the fuck out after you're done
And I hops in my ride to make a quick run

I used to know a bitch named Eric Wright
We used to roll around and fuck the hoes at night
Tight than a motherfucker with the gangsta beats
And we was ballin' on the motherfuckin' Compton streets
Peep, the shit got deep and it was on
Number 1 song after number 1 song
Long as my motherfuckin' pockets was fat
I didn't give a fuck where the bitch was at
But she was hangin' with a white bitch doin' the shit she do
Suckin' on his dick just to get a buck or 2
And the few ends she got didn't mean nothin'
Now she's suing cause the shit she be doin' ain't shit
Bitch can't hang with the streets, she found herself short
So now she's takin' me to court
It's real conversation for your ass
So recognize and pass to Daz

Now as I'm rollin' with my nigga Dre and Eastwood
Fuckin' hoes, clockin' dough up to no good
We flip flop and serve hoes like flap jacks
(But we don't love them hoes) Bitch, and it's like that
This is what you look for in a ho who got cash flow
Ya run up in them hoes and grab the cash
And get your dash on
While you're chillin', with your homies and shit
And how my niggaz kick the anthem like this, bitch!

Bitches ain't shit but hoes and tricks
Lick on these nuts and suck the dick
Get's the fuck out after you're done
And I hops in my ride to make a quick run

To the store, to get me a 4-0
Snoop Doggy Dogg paged, that must mean more hoes
So I head down the street to Long Beach
Just so I could meet, a freak
To lick me from my head to my feet
And I'm here, now I'm ready to be done up
Nothin' but homies around so I puts my gun up
Bitches on my nuts like clothes
But I'm from the pound and we don't love them hoes
How could you trust a hoe? (Why?)
'Cause a hoe's a trick
I don't love them tricks (Why?)
'Cause a trick's a bitch
And my dick's constantly in her mouth
And turnin' them trick ass hoes the fuck out, now

I once had a bitch named Mandy May
Used to be up in them guts like everyday
The pussy was the bomb, had a nigga on sprung
I was in love like a motherfucker lickin' the pearl tongue
The homies used to tell me that she wasn't no good
But I'm the maniac in black, Mr. Snoop Eastwood
So I figure niggaz wouldn't trip with mine
Guess what? Got gaffled by one time
I'm back to the motherfucking county jail
6 months on my chest, now it's time to bail
I get's released on a hot sunny day
My nigga D.O.C. and my homey Dr Dre
Scooped in a coupe, Snoop we got news
Your girl was trickin' while you was draped in your county blues
I ain't been out a second
And already gotta do some motherfucking chin checking
Move up the block as we groove up the block
See my girl's house, Dre, pass the glock
Kick in the do', I look on the flo'
It's my little cousin Daz and he's fuckin' my hoe, yo (Bitches ain't shit)
I uncocked my shit, I'm heart-broke but I'm still loc'ed
Man, fuck a bitch!

Bitches ain't shit but hoes and tricks
Lick on these nuts and suck the dick
Get's the fuck out after you're done
And I hops in my ride to make a quick run

Get's the fuck out after you're done

(Bitches ain't shit) I don't give a fuck about a bitch
But I and her know that they can't fade this
'Cause I'm doing my own thing down with the swing
I'm hangin' with Death Row like it ain't no thing
I say you know can't deal
'Cause I'm a bitch that's real
Motherfucker need to step back, hell yeah
They need to chill
Because I don't give a fuck
And I don't give a fuck
And I don't give a fuck
I don't give a fuck

And now I gotta do some,
I gotta do some shit that's clean
But when I'm on a dick, hell yeah, I get real mean
Like a washing machine
I can wash the clothes
All the hoes knows
That I'm on the flow ho
But they can't hang with my type og swing
I ain't tryin' to say I suck every ding-a-lang
But just the juicy ones
With he tip of the tongue
And then their sprung
With the nuts hung

Prepare for a war, it's on, I'm head hunting
Hit the button, and light shit up like Red Dawn

When we were lovers was she there

We came so close but...

Simply, we lied and lost each other

Cause once it drops we know that they smashin'
They gettin' down in an orderly fashion
Killin' them dance moves like an assassin
Wild in the nights and you know we get crashin'
Time to get faded, soaked and sweaty

With the hunger of a lion, the strength of a sun
I don't need to sweat it when the competition come
Original style, like an eight of eight drum
So I don't run the track, no, I make the track run
My momma taught me words, my daddy built rockets
I hold 'em both together now, tell me what I got
It's a pretty small weapon, I can shoot it, I can drop it
But learn to respect it 'cause you clearly can't stop it

Like that

It ain't over 'cause the sharks on the left side, the snakes on the right
And anything you do, they wanna get a little bite
It really doesn't matter if you're wrong or if you're right
'Cause once they get their teeth in nothing really fights
And razzle me I do it like I got nothing to lose
And you can run your mouth like you could try to fill my shoes
But steady little soldier, I ain't standing next to you
I can lay it on the ground before you're even in my view
Like that

Give me the strength of the rising sun
Give me the truth of the words unsung
And when the last bells ring, the poor men sing
Bring me to kingdom come

This is something for your people on the block to
Blackout and rock to, give you what you need
Like Papa, who shot ya
Seperate the weak from the obsolete
You're meek, I creep hard on impostors
And switch styles on the dime, quick-witted y'all
Quit tripping, I don't have time for your crying
I grind tough, sucka, make your mind up
Are you in the firing squad or are you in the line-up?
Bang, bang, little monkey man playing
With the big guns only get you slain
I ain't playing, I'm just saying
You ain't got a sliver of a chance
I get ill or I deliver while you quiver in your parents
So shake, shake down, money, here's the break down
You can play the bank, I'ma play the bank take down
And no mistakes now I'm coming to get you
I'm just a Banksy, you're a Brainwash, get the picture?
It's like that

We swim against the rising waves
That crash against the shore
The body bends until it breaks
The early morning sings no more

So rest your head
It's time to sleep
And dream of what's in store
The body bends until it breaks
And sings again no more
'Cause time has torn the flesh away
The early morning sings no more",Until It Breaks,2013

Telling me that you mean no harm
You stand me up like a crutch, another arm
But only when I'm gone have I been away too long

No, you don't belong to me, I think you lied to me
And with my back against this wall, it's hard to be strong
No, you'd tell me anything, look what you've done to me
Still I tell myself that tomorrow you'll be long gone

Any given time or place I never will forget the disgrace on your face
So full of love, will it ever be enough?
Ten feet tall and bullet proof I never thought that I had a thing to lose
Well, it looks like after all, I'm gonna have to choose

No, you don't belong to me, I think you lied to me

No, you'd tell me anything, look what you've done to me

You help pass the time, but I'm doing fine on my own
So there's no good reason why to live such a lie
Tell me have I been gone away too long?

No, you don't belong to me, I think you lied to me

Bullets coming off our lips

I thought we had someone for that
But by the looks of things you fired the maid again

Yeah I confess, I know the floor won't clean itself
And you're worried half to death
About the things that just won't matter in the end

Take off those shoes
Looks like you could really use a glass slipper
Yeah I know it's been a pisser
So one strong zipper might suffice

Come on girl, I'm begging please
Get off your knees, I got the keys
And I'll pick you up at midnight
In my suit up pumpkin ride

'Cause you're my Cinderella
We're two birds of a feather
I'll even sing to you acapella
You're so hella good looking tonight
My Cinderella
Whenever you need some shelter
We can stand under my umbrella
Together
Need no fortune teller to see it's forever with you
Oh no, it's forever with you

Don't watch the clock,
I paid some dude to make it stop
But we won't worry 'bout tomorrow
There's no sorrow in this fairytale I wrote

I gotta say
You still take my breath away
That look reminds me of that day
You scratched your number on that yellow poster note

And now you're my Cinderella
We're two birds of a feather
I'll even sing to you acapella
You're so hella good looking tonight

Whenever you need some shelter
We can stand under my umbrella
Together
Need no fortune teller to see it's forever with you
Oh no, it's forever with you

Check out those stars
I picked 'em up one day on Mars
And you thought I was at the bar
Well okay maybe there's a little truth to that

As I would say
And if you squint a certain way
You'll see they kinda spelled your name
Just a little
But okay maybe that's a stretch

But you're my Cinderella
We're two birds of a feather
I'll even sing to you acapella
Forever
Or until you've had enough

'Cause you're my Cinderella
And I'm your kind of fella
I wanna kiss you there and tell ya'
You're so hella good looking tonight

I hit every curb, every red light
Trying to keep both hands on the wheel
But through it all I'm

Still undefeated
With my back against the ropes
Still undefeated
You can knock me down with mighty blows
But you cannot break my hope

Weak knees, can't stand
Raise up your hands
Don't walk away
Been sucker punched but I'm not down
My feet have never left the ground
It's a fight that I can't fix
Like a cut that needs a stitch
And somehow through it all I stay

Still undefeated
With my back against the ropes

You can knock me down with mighty blows
But you cannot break my hope
Cannot break my hope
Cannot break my hope, yeah

Get back up and we're still breathing
We are the ones
We'll take the hit straight to the face
And never look the other way

At home in the lost and found
You say that I'm much too proud
Someone who's taken pleasure
In breaking down

Never mind the mannequins
Drunk in their hollow town
Drinking their spoils down
Cheap imitations
A revelation is now

Yeah, you won't find me
I'm going M.I.A.
Tonight I'm leaving
Going M.I.A.
Getting lost in you again
Is better than being numb

Counting every minute
Till the feeling comes crashing down
Run when it hits the ground
I'm good at escaping,
But better at flaking out
 
Calling unanswered
The center becomes blown out
Stuck on the inside now
It's fear I'm embracing
I never could face you down

Yeah, you won't find me
I'm going M.I.A.
Tonight I'm leaving

Tombant sous la feuille en gouttes de sang

Evitez les belles

Quand le bonheur nous fuit et qu'il nous file entre les doigts
Elle arrondit les hommes et la vie, elle adoucit nos pleurs
Quand les temps sont durs et qu'on attend des jours meilleurs",Heureusement Que La Musique Est La,2003

On oublie 
Hier est si loin d’aujourd’hui 
Mais il m’arrive souvent
De rêver encore à l’adolescent
Que je ne suis plus
On sourit
En revoyant sur les photos jaunies
L’air un peu trop sûr de soi 
Que l’on prend à seize ans 
Et que l’on fait de son mieux
Pour paraître plus vieux


J’irai bien refaire un tour du côté de chez Swann
Revoir mon premier amour qui me donnait rendez-vous
Sous le chêne
Et se laissait embrasser sur la joue
Je ne voudrais pas refaire le chemin à l’envers
Et pourtant je paierais cher pour revivre un seul instant
Le temps du bonheur
A l’ombre d’une fille en fleur.


On oublie 
Et puis un jour il suffit d’un parfum 
Pour qu’on retrouve soudain 
La magie d’un matin 
Et l’on oublie l’avenir
Pour quelques souvenirs.


Et je m’en vais faire un tour du côté de chez Swann
Revoir mon premier amour qui me donnait rendez-vous
Sous le chêne
Et se laissait embrasser sur la joue
Je ne voudrais pas refaire le chemin à l’envers
Et pourtant je paierais cher pour revivre un seul instant
Le temps du bonheur
A l’ombre d’une fille en fleur.",Du Côté de Chez Swann,2010

And I see you've married good

And the light's on in the hall
Yes the door is always open and the light's on in the hall
And you know that I'll be waiting if you'd ever come to call
And when night falls on that mansion 
And you're lying in his bed
When he begs for your attention 
Will you think of me instead
And when he reaches out to touch me
 Is my face turned to the wall

But I know them days are over
People think I'm going crazy
But I know this game is over

It's game over
How could I have any fucking time
With all this weight on my shoulders?
I used to wish I was older
Until the day that I got older
And now I'm growing up with a bag full of problems
Thinking, how do I solve them?
And it's like, if I ain't got a job
Then my mum's gonna think I'm useless
But I don't wanna be no super student
Mummy, I'm only human
I applied for jobs in retail
And all the times I tried: ignored, declined
I never got email
I was gonna take it to uni
But I got tired in the ends like seashells
How many fucking times did teachers told me that I was talented
15 putting in work
Trying to get herd like I want to bring cattle in
Now I got all this pressure
And I don't know how to handle it
My life's like a magic trick
'Cause all my options are vanishing
From Cadbury to cannabis
And sticks in the air like javelins
So many man got poked
And that's why I'm onto Not3s like Maddison
I wanna make time for Alisson
'Cause her body good like Samaritan

I don't wanna give no warnings

Dave,"Like
I met my girl when I was 18 years old
And she was just turning 23
I really love her from my heart
And even though I don't deserve it fam I hope she loves me
So I just done this private show I'm doing Footlocker promo
And judging from the postcode it was Shoreditch or Soho
Did 6 or 7 tracks, made 6 or 7 racks
A couple days later on twitter I saw this photo of myself and I was grinning
That 4K camera of quality had got me tripping
So I'm checking out who did it
When I stumbled on this girl
And I could tell that she was different
A couple hours later now I'm liking all her pictures
I ain't finished
I typed her twitter name into my Insta so I could check on every single little digit
Why didn't I just message her?
Trust me I was thinking, but I'm a self-centred rapper too concerned about my image
The truth
So when she hit me first I'm pretty shocked I didn't burst
I'm calling Josh, Jack and Juss who am I ringing first?
Man I was so excited
That I replied a minute later that's that bro I think that you just let her know excited
Too excited, no clue on what I should do excited
So I'm just typing, rambling like a fool, excited

Look
Look
And we were talking for hours over some minor things
Ignoring everyone else to her I'm replying quick
This type of chick she got a spark like you were lighting spliffs
You know you like her when you're thinking about your words
She got me typing, deleting my messages then re-writing
In the hope that there's a smile when she's replying
The highlight of my day, them phone calls in the night, it's the little things
The girl, she had a vibe and I liked it and
She's into photography and she's got a passion for it
And she respects that I'm rapping but she ain't catting for it
See that's the perfect balance
There's nothing better than a girl with talent
Drive, ambition, all of them things above
She's showing an abundance
I ain't even met her yet
She works around the corner but lives just outside of London
I ain't fronting, I'm a sweet boy
Intentions are in question so my compliments are decoys
If that even makes sense?
The first time I met her, I'm surrounded by my friends
Random ends on some staircase
So much for a first date
I just had a show
And I asked if she could meet me after
Maybe we could chill, you never know where things could go
No problem she down to roll
Travelled in the cold
So I went across the road, grey hoodie under a coat
If I'm remembering correctly
It's always kind of weird when the person that you were texting
Is the person you are obsessed with
I was on her from the jump
I think she was wearing pumps or Vans when I first met her, no, it's either either one
She was looking so attractive I barely saw skin 'cause she was covered like a mattress
Man, I think that she's the one
I was stuck for twenty seconds tryna to give the girl a hug
And all my friends are drunk so fuck it, I'm about to kiss her
Any complications, I'm blaming it on the liquor
Changing my name on Twitter and blocking her on my Insta
I saw her skin blush the moment that our lips touched
She pulled my bottom lip until it stretched
Kissed me on my cheek until she reached around my neck
And had me moaning like a bitch
Even though I'm wearing jeans, I had to re-arrange my dick so she don't see that I'm erect
It's the first time we met, got me feeling like a creep
And that strawberry flavour gave her tongue a kinda sweet little taste
And we could speak about anything we were friends first
I dropped her to the station I remember
'Cause we had a conversation for ages about our dreams
And the things that we hadn't seen and all that we intended to do
I bet she's hoping my intentions are true
And as months went by we both got into it, and intimate
And I'ma spare you the details 'cause both of our parents are probably listening
But really we were into it
Into us, into this
Into everything about each other we were lovers and I love her 
'Cause she knows me and that's probably why she told me you ain't ready for a girl
You're still a little kid that's getting ready for the world and you don't need that kinda burden
But I told her that I want it
And I'm just being honest, yes I know that girls exist but I don't see them as a problem
I meant every single word
And I ain't gonna lie and say DM's have been absurd but out of every single girl
This is the weirdest of positions
It's usually the girl that's asking where I see her fitting or a place on her position
But I'm telling her I need it
And I don't think she sees it, so I'm being even sweeter when we're speaking and we're meeting
I've got affectionate messages, you could read them
You gotta tell a girl that she's beautiful 'til she sees it
Believes it, understands it more than physically
Mentally, and the way that I'm feeling
I could talk 10 years about the moment that we shared
The jokes that we had running
The places that we've been
The music we made together producing next to my bed
Then making my minor changes in reference to what she said
I think I start to getting tired, my schedule's a mess
Replies are gettin' lazy and my lady knows it's crazy
But she's there if I'm in need
While I'm at shows getting tempted by girls that are on their knees
You know I'm only a teen, it's like my eyes started drifting
Not as easy as I pictured to give your all to a woman
Ignoring all this attention that's been getting to my head
The sex is so accessible, one message or text and girls will get in your bed
She's tryna make it happen with photos and her events
I mentioned it's her passion, photography is her thing
And I don't know if it's the pressure
Where paper meets the passion and the pleasure
We all gotta work to survive
So now she's popping up at shows
Taking pictures on her own
And at first it wasn't cool
But fuck it we let it go
Until I saw her in some rapper's tracksuit, I felt a way
She told me it was work and she was in some studio
Taking pictures and I just sighed
Some halfway wannabe rappers that fed her lies
They ain't looking for no picture
I know it's your profession
But read their intentions
They ain't paying male photographers to shoot that same session
And that felt so disrespectful, standing on our dreams
And crushing 'em, I just told her it's nothing do what you need to do
If I ain't feeding you
Then my opinion's all I'm giving when I speak to you
'Cause I don't have the right
Why should girls be punished for a male's dirty mind?
When I think about it now, I'm ashamed to the core
I mean how many men stop their women from 
Achieving what they can because in secret they've been feeling insecure
And I can't handle my emotions, it's probably why I didn't see her
Talent when I shoulda been supporting and promoting
Like I didn't have a platform, a voice and a following
With everyone I knew, I really coulda do a lot of things to help chase her dream
But instead of me to grow into the person that she needs
I acted like I couldn't see
And I don't mean to say this like I don't trust the girl
But how can I trust her if I don't trust myself?
And even girls can get tempted you know how it goes
What if she meets a bigger rapper when she's at a show?
What if he sees her backstage?
What if he selling lots?
What if he's got a bigger car, got a better watch?
That doesn't bother me, she really ain't material
It's all the little things they do that put the fear in you
What if he actually replies?
What if he phones her too?
What if he's doing all the things that I'm supposed to do?
What if he's listening, laughing, relating?
What if he even cares to ask her how her day's been?
What if he's trying to give her everything she needs 
And expects from the one damn person that she's dating?
I shoulda helped her follow her dream
But instead I held her back and had her following me
And boys got a brave face so they'll never know
That it hurts just as much when you let them go",How I Met My Ex,2017
Dave,"I spent my 19th birthday in the hospital
With my brother and my mum
And I know it sounds dumb but I felt like I lost it all
The pain's compulsory, suffering's optional
Takeshi's castle, my life's got obstacles
I'm still dealing with a whole load of stress
I see my older brother so close to the edge
And that there put a hole in my chest
And then they tell you home's where the heart is
But I got a hole where my heart is
Because I let a hoe where my heart is
Never again, I had to tell her that we're better as friends
I never messaged again
Every message I send, ends up in a groupchat
'Cause girls go and tell all their friends
That's one of many reasons why I ain't sending DMs
Look, I'm gonna keep this cake and I'm gonna eat this cake
That's why I'm living three lives, I'm in GTA
I'm in Los Angeles driving a Mercedes and it's funny because honestly I didn't think I'd see LA
Surprise birthday party I didn't see this cake, coming
I need this money like its EMA
You gotta separate the rats from the G's if you can't handle cheese, how the hell you gonna be a great?
I need a blazing inferno for my enemies
Behind my back I know that everybody sends for me
And I'd respond but I don't even have the time
I mean, asking Avelino couldn't help me find the energy
I don't think my ends want the best for me
That's why the question me, fake G checking me
Fuck the road but if anybody's testing me
It's one step away like a 5-a-side penalty
Every Santander Nationwide remembers me
Right pocket full of cards, I'm a referee
Ain't it funny how this money that I'm getting came from fucking PA's like I'm sleeping with a secretary
Secondly, your girlfriend's obsessed with me
But that's a story for another day and this is why love is fucked
'Cause you went and put your trust in her and then she sent me nudes
I said ""Nuh-uh-uh, cover up""
I aired it, certain girls I can't respect
We're all nothing to someone, and that you can't forget
So just remember when the girl's playing hard to get
There's probably another person that she's trying hard to get
And there's probably a girl in your phone right now that you hardly text
That's looking for love
But everybody wants what they can't touch, so

If you, touch my money you can see what I'm about
You can ask your little sister I will be inside your house
Eating from your fridge, feet up on your couch
Tell your little brother ""Butter me a sandwich, spread in evenly amounts""
You think I’m playing any games?
Why do you think I talk about cars, women and chains
On half of the songs I make, materialistic aims
Make me feel a way when I want it
When I got it, it don’t ever feel the same
We got different types of problems
I’m getting corporate tax on this cash that I'm making
And at the same time I need to vanquish my paigons
If you think it's dead you're mistaken
I'm hot headed and dangerous
And still living in this matrix
All I wanna do is make my loved ones proud
In this year alone we made three hundred thousand
But my mum won't smile becuase her son's on trial
We've got different types of problems
What do you know about living in a shadow
Where every single thing that you can do is being tainted
'Cause your brother's in the station and he's ill to the marrow
12 or 13 when I turned into an adult
All them kids my age were going TeenFest
When I was getting searched by a golden retriever in a Cat. A prison while I'm standing on an arrow
We used to have cards and now we're playing with swords
My G went from Blackjack to a black Jack Sparrow
I know so many man who got a case on their head that would kill to come home
But there chances are narrow in this world that we live in
Nobody listens, we do have thoughts
But nobody's thinking and I get it
'Cause none of us are tyna play the victim
Any disrespect then retaliation, instant
I know a lot of man have been dodging karma
And they think it's all laughter 'til the bitch comes to kiss them
You know the difference between life and death is one bad decision, 3 or 4 inches
So many man my age have got P.T.S.D and I don't think that it's hit them
If you envision, the way that we're living
The things that we had seen, situations that we'd been in
You would understand why I don't wanna talk about my life in every song I've ever written
I really wanna help, but it's out of my control and jurisdiction
'Cause a lot of road yutes have got a sickness, mentally

Like, look
My mummy always used to tell me this
""David, listen when your older's speaking""
I know man that listened to their olders speaking
And now they're all life'd off and they don't know the reason
In a weird way summer is the coldest season
You'll get killed at a party for the smallest reason
One day you're chilling in secondary
Next day your right hand's a memory
So when I say that I'm alone, do you know the feeling?
When I say the game's over, do you know the meaning?
I mean that I don't have the time for this
I need a girl but same time there's no time for them
I got people inside and I don't write to them
It's like I don't feel pain no more
I can't do journeys on a train no more
Can't shed a tear writing on a page no more
I don't wanna play games no more
I don't want my friends on a case no more
And trust me, I don't want a war on the ends
But it's like you wanna start it so say no more
I'm too big for this nonsense, I don't need problems
Meetings, 1.5 milli ain't an option
I don't need a deal or an option
In my own neighbourhood
Me, Jack, Benny in the office
I don't need excel, Sony, drama
Our team's faster, street Sam Chara
I got a lot of love for everyone that checks for me
And a lot of love for certain girls sexually
Texting me, saying that she slept on me
And definitely wishes that she slept with me

Look
On another note I wanna say thanks to Carl
One of my closest from young and we're still at it now
I remember when we learnt to play piano
Just to make each other jealous, who'd've thought that we would practice now
Your talent's been standing out
Be proud of your dream, you should stand and shout
I remember last year you never had a clue
And this year you went and did ""Attitude""
Speaking of attitude, it's only right I say sorry for my attitude
And I ain't never mad at you
Tyrell, Manon, Frasier especially
I got a lot of things I'm dealing with mentally
I feel down a lot and I ain't got the energy
I need all of your help to get the best from me
There's way too much to do, I ain't getting sleep
And last time I got a rest they arrested me
Tell me I treatment for a video I didn't make myself from scratch
Every lyric, every melody
Every fucking beat
Every little detail in the artwork and video
Everything is me
A wonderful team and a God that I serve
My friends and my mum, my brothers and my girl
I don't want short-term success or a banger
Man are signing to a sentence, getting lost in the words
And it's fine if you sign man it's each to their own
But these clones need to know that I'm different from the world
Don't compare me to them, they couldn't beat me at my worst
It don't matter if I'm rapping or I'm singing on the verse

Look
People don't get that I'm serious
I don't wanna play games no more
And I don't wanna talk to these girls no more
I can't fuck a girl that's in it for the fame no more
And man can't talk on my name no more
I give it 5 or 10 minutes 'til your main ting talks
She's telling me that they don't talk no more but I'm pretty sure that his wifey knows more
No more, no I don't wanna play no more
No talks if it isn't money made no more
No more, no I don't wanna play no more
I don't wanna play no games no more
And I don't wanna see my girl no more
'Cause I don't really wanna see her hurt no more
My mum telling me that she's gotta stop working and I'm telling mummy you ain't gotta work no more
No more, mummy you ain't gotta hurt no more
You ain't gotta cry in your shirt no more
Mummy you ain't gotta wake up for work in the freezing cold in the middle of the night for a cheque no more
Mummy you ain't gotta cry no more
You ain't gotta stress in the night no more
And I ain't gotta say no more

Dave,"Look
A question for the new Prime Minister
How'd you have a heart so sinister?
How are you so wasteful when people are dying in Somalia
Afghanistan, Egypt, Libya?
The irony is we have no business in Syria
But kids are getting killed for all the business in Syria
And then they try and tell you it's ISIS, it's ISIS
In their attempts at killing it, how many civilians died
So what's the difference between us and them?
When you got drones killing kids just touching ten
Then when a bomb goes off, every politician's lost
Like that last strike that didn't kill a hundred men
You ain't the same as them
But all that fuel for the fire is what you gave to them
And what you take from them

All my life I know my mum's been working
In and out of nursing, struggling, hurting
I just find it fucked that the government is struggling
To care for a person that cares for a person
So where's the discussion on wages and budgets?
How they made them redundant when I was a young'un
The letters in our car said my mum was overdraft
But somehow I still had dinner money in my pocket
And even the little things like ordering pizza
Were probably the reason for overtime in the evening
Five till ten, six hours of sleeping
For twenty-two years my mum was doing the cleaning
Dreaming that her kids would have a better life
Go in bed at night, struggling with getting by
That's the reality for millions of people in a nation
Where a lot of us were looking for a second try

A question for the new Prime Minister
And please, tell me if I'm being narrowminded
But how do we spend so much money on defence
And weapons to wage war when the NHS is dying?
Bursting at the seams, and what about them people
That voted for us to leave for the money that it would see?
350 million we give to the EU every week
That our health service needs
But now them politicians got what they wanted
Can you see an empty promise or a poster on the street?
Nurses in tears 'cause they're working every hour of the week
And they still don't have the money that they need
You brought the heart of the nation to its knees
Underpaid, understaffed, overworked
And overseen by people who can't ever understand
How it feels to live life like you and me

Patients lying in the corridors
'Cause doctors can't even find a bed for them to sleep
I remember A&E and all them sickening screams
Of a little girl waiting for a surgeon to be seen
Privatized healthcare, guns for police
Increased uni fees, is this what they're selling us?
Well, let me remind you just in case you've forgotten
That we live in Great Britain, not in Donald Trump's America
Speaking of America, state and the President
With all due respect, I've got something to say to them
I just find it funny you can't give a hand to Palestine
But you can trade whole arms with Saudi Arabia

Look, look
I've got a question for the new Prime Minister
At Grenfell Tower, your response was ridiculous
You hid like a coward behind your five million
Dodged responsibility and acted like you're innocent
And I can see you're terrified, you're not good at telling lies
I'm getting why you stay away from everything that's televised
You look like a robot and you don't speak with any life
It feels to me like any guy in press could've said them lines
Imagine going to the council for the safety of your block
And you've got kids but they're ignoring you at every time
Everyone who knew about that cladding
Should really be going prison under rule of joint enterprise
But if it ain't a little kid with a knife
I bet that judge is going easy when he's giving him time
They don't deserve to be free
Any builder, MP, that knew about the conditions but did it to save cheese
When I listen to the things that the residents had seen
I was so shocked I couldn't even speak
Families they know that had died in their sleep
How you choke on the smoke when you're struggling to breathe
The glow from the fire
The panic when you hear all the sirens
The crackling, the popping and the muffled-out screams
The fear in the eyes of a man that was trapped
Who jumped fifteen floors from the tower to the street
I could only hear a fraction of the pain and the grief
Closing my eyes, trying hard not to cry
And the joy and relief in the face of a man
When a woman from the flat said his neighbour was alive
No help from the council in keeping any list
Of the people that survived, his neighbours and peers
And for that whole meeting I could see that he was trying
So his smile was an island in a sea full of tears

Look, I've got a message for our old Prime Minister
David Cameron
I mean you fucked us, resigned, then sneaked out the firing line
I wanna know how you managed it
And are you bathing in the sun while them papers have a run
At the woman that you left here to handle it?
You gonna teach your little lad to be the man that's got a plan
And then the moment that it fails to abandon it?
Are there bullies in his school?
And when you pick him up after class, can you feel his embarrassment?
I mean you never gave a fuck about the youth and that's the truth
There's no sympathy for you or your cabinet
I really wish I could've seen how you were scramblin'
When you lost the referendum that you had to win
I feel like politicians are all addicts
In a big fat game but it's lives that you gamble with

I've got a question for the leader of the Labour Party
Jeremy Corbyn, where do you wanna take the country to?
Honestly, I wanna put my trust in you
But you can understand why if I've got trust issues
Do you really have the faith of your party?
Do you really have faith in the party that will come with you?
And how do you plan on keeping all the promises?
Man, if I'm being honest, Sir, I'm struggling to get with it
I just ain't getting it
Everybody's great until you get them into office and then guys start forgetting things
Prove to us you're different, don't promise me anything
Go and get justice for Rashan Charles and Edison
And if you haven't had the thought to vote yet
Or protest 'cause you don't really see the progress
I hope you know that what they're saying is affecting us
The small steps are way better than no steps",Question Time,2017

Sur les hauts de Hurlevent
Je suis venu souvent
Me promener parmi les lierres
Et m’allonger dans la bruyère
Pour penser à toi
Penser à toi

Mais si le vent te fait peur
Tu n’as plus rien à craindre
Je t’apprendrai à aimer
Si tu viens me rejoindre
Et nous ferons
Des hauts de Hurlevent

Où chantera le vent
Nous graverons nos deux cœurs 
Sur les vieux murs de pierres
Nous ouvrirons les fenêtres
Envahies par le lierre

On oublie 
Hier est si loin d’aujourd’hui 
Mais il m’arrive souvent
De rêver encore à l’adolescent
Que je ne suis plus
On sourit
En revoyant sur les photos jaunies
L’air un peu trop sûr de soi 
Que l’on prend à seize ans 
Et que l’on fait de son mieux
Pour paraître plus vieux


J’irai bien refaire un tour du côté de chez Swann
Revoir mon premier amour qui me donnait rendez-vous
Sous le chêne
Et se laissait embrasser sur la joue
Je ne voudrais pas refaire le chemin à l’envers
Et pourtant je paierais cher pour revivre un seul instant
Le temps du bonheur
A l’ombre d’une fille en fleur.


On oublie 
Et puis un jour il suffit d’un parfum 
Pour qu’on retrouve soudain 
La magie d’un matin 
Et l’on oublie l’avenir
Pour quelques souvenirs.

Revoir mon premier amour qui me donnait rendez-vous

And the jukebox was busted at the bus de-pot

He was talking to the ceiling and the walls
He closed his eyes and hit the stage in 1955
As the screams of the children filled the hall

Dave Alvin,"He had a blue wing tattooed on his shoulder
Well, it might have been a bluebird, I don't know
but he'd get stone drunk and talk about Alaska
The salmon boats and 45 below
Well, he got that blue wing up in Walla Walla
and his cellmate there was a Little Willy John
and Willie, he was once a great blues singer
so Wing & Willie wrote him up a song

(CHORUS)
They sang, it's dark in here, can't see the light
but I look at this blue wing when I close my eyes
and I fly away, beyond these walls
up above the clouds, where the rain don't fall
on a poor man's dreams
They paroled blue wing in August of 1963
He moved north, picking apples in the town of Wenatchee
And then winter finally caught him in a rundown trailer park
on the south side of Seattle where the days grow grey and dark
And he drank and he dreamt a vision of when the seven still ran free
and his father's fathers crossed that wide old Bering sea
and the land belonged to everyone, and there were old songs yet to sing
now, it's broken down to a cheap hotel and a tattooed prison wing
Now, it's dark in here... (repeat chorus)
Well, he drank his way to L.A., and that's where he died
and no one knew his Christian name, and there was no one there to cry

Dave Alvin,"Well, I left my home and my one true love
East of the Ohio River
My father said we'd never wed
For I had me no gold nor silver

But my darling dear, please shed no tears
But I think that it's fair to warn you
That I return to claim your hand
As the King of California

Over deserts hot and mountains cold
I traveled the Indian country
Whispering your name under lonesome skies
Remembering my only company

But my darling dear, please have no fear
For I think that it's fair to warn you
That I return to claim your hand
As the King of California

I went up from Sacramento town
To the Sierra gold fields
And I worked my stake on a riverbank?
Dreaming just how a rich man feels

Now my darling dear, listen here
For I think that it's fair to warn you
That I return to claim your hand
As the King of California

Now the dead man's lying at my feet
Who tried to steal my earnings
Yet I still recall your tender kiss
Though this bullet in my chest is burning

But my darling dear, please have no fear
For I think that it's fair to warn you
That I return to claim your hand
As the King of California

That I return to claim your hand
As the King of California

But things just ain't the same 
She turns out the light and cries in the dark 
Won't answer when I call her name

On the stairs I smoke a cigarette alone 
The Mexican kids are shooting fireworks below 
Hey, baby, it's the Fourth of July 
Hey, baby, it's the Fourth of July

She gives me her cheek when I want her lips 
And I don't have the strength to go 
On the lost side of town in a dark apartment 
We gave up trying so long ago

And I may drown in still water

Now I live on Lake Shasta
And Lake Shasta is where I will stay

There's the South San Joaquin
Where the seeds of the dust bowl are found
And there's a place called Mt. Whitney
From where the mighty Kern River comes down

Now it's not deep nor wide
But it's a mean piece of water my friend
And I may cross on the highway
But I'll never swim Kern River again

Where a drunk man lay sleepin' in a ragged old tram
And the lines on his face mark a life on the run
Is he somebody's husband, somebody's son?

Where the victims lay scattered across the front page
And there's always some loner, on a spree with a gun
Is he somebody's husband, somebody's son?

From the death rows of prison to the soup kitchen door
Each soul is an equal in the eyes of the Lord
Though hatred consumes them, once they were loved
They were somebody's husband, somebody's son

Cherish your mother, crave the love of your wife
And forget not the outcast and the homeless were once

And Joe bought all the gas in Johnny's old Ford
He always said that's what friends were for.

When Johnny married Tina, Joe married Dee
Two blonde-haired sisters from Covington, Kentucky
And in '67 Johnny joined the Corps
Joe did too, but he never knew what for.

And tonight in this barroom he's easin' his pain
He's thinkin' of someone, but he won't say the name
Folks say he's a hero, but he'll tell you he ain't
He left a hero in the jungle back in 1968.

Johnny went from job to job tryin' to make ends meet
And Tina divorced him back in '83

And Johnny's got a grandkid that he barely knows.

And talks about her children and her third husband
But when he asks about someone they used to know
Dee says, â??Johnny that was so long ago.â??

I'm an old man at thirty-nine
With two kids and an ex-wife
Who moved up to Riverside

Drivin' back roads every night
Mountains east of El Cajon
North of the Tecate line.

Where the California summer sun
Will burn right through your soul
But in the winter you can freeze to death
In the California snow.

I catch the ones I'm able to
And watch the others slip away
I know some by their faces
And I even know some by name
I guess they think that we're all
Movie stars and millionaires
I guess that they still believe
That dreams come true up here.

But I guess the weather's warmer down in Mexico
And no one ever tells them 'bout the California snow.

Last winter I found a man and wife
Just about daybreak
Layin' in a frozen ditch
South of the interstate
I wrapped 'em both in blankets
But she'd already died
The next day we sent him back alone
Across the borderline.

I don't know where they came from
Or where they planned to go
But we carried her all night long
Through the California snow.

Sometimes when I'm alone out here
I get to thinkin' about my life
Maybe I should go to Riverside
And try to fix things with my wife
Or maybe just get in my truck
And drive as far as I can go
Away from all the ghosts that haunt
The California snow.

Sittin' beneath a fluorescent light

Dave Alvin,"I was born Everett Ruess
I've been dead for sixty years
I was just a young boy in my twenties
The day I disappeared

Into the Grand Escalante Badlands
Near the Utah and Arizona line
And they never found my body, boys
Or understood my mind

I grew up in California
And I loved my family and my home
But I ran away to the High Sierra
Where I could live free and alone

And folks said, ?he's just another wild kid
He?ll grow out of it in time?
But they never found my body, boys
Or understood my mind

I broke broncos with the cowboys
I sang healing songs with the Navajo
I did the snake dance with the Hopi
And I drew pictures everywhere I go

Then I swapped all my drawings for provisions
To get what I needed to get by
And they never found my body, boys
Or understood my mind

Well I hate your crowded cities
With the sad and hopeless mobs
And I hate your grand cathedrals
Where you try to trap God

?Cause I know God is here in the canyons
With the rattlesnakes and the pinon pines
And they never found my body, boys
Or understood my mind

They say I was killed by a drifter
Or I froze to death in the snow
Maybe mauled by a wildcat
Or I'm livin? down in Mexico

But my end, it doesn't really matter
All that counts is how you live your life
And they never found my body, boys
Or understood my mind

But you give your dreams away as you get older
And oh but I never gave up mine
And they'll never find my body, boys
Or understand my mind

Dave Alvin,"I guess she put her blue dress on
And walked out late last night
Left one silk stocking 
Dangling from the bedside light
I sobered up and called her name 
Just before the dawn
I saw her footprints in the sand 
And knew that she had gone
Down the Rio Grande.

I pulled out of Albuquerque 
Prayin' I wasn't late
I got a couple cups of coffee
At some joint off the interstate
Passin' through Las Cruces
I swear I saw her car
She always said she'd go someday
But never said how far
Down the Rio Grande.

Maybe she's in Brownsville
She's got some family there
She was always talkin' ‘bout
The salty Gulf Coast air
Where the river ends
Down the Rio Grande.

I saw an old grey heron
Flyin' south against the wind
Storm clouds over Juarez
Rollin' east to the Big Bend
I drove down Highway Ninety
Through a dusty desert wind
I didn't know where it would lead me
Or if I'd find her again
Down the Rio Grande.

I lit my last cigarette
As the sky began to clear
Black mountains up ahead
A red sundown in my mirror
Lost all the border 
‘Tween the future and the past
One fading slowly
And the other comin' fast
Down the Rio Grande.

Maybe she's in Brownsville
She's got some family there
She was always talkin' ‘bout
The salty gulf coast air
Where the river ends
Down the Rio Grande.

I bought a bottle in Del Rio
And I parked on the side of the road
I stayed up all night 
Starin' at the lights of Mexico
And I walked down to border bridge
At the break of day
And I threw that empty bottle off
And I watched it float away
Down the Rio Grande.

Maybe she's in Brownsville
She's got some family there

Gun's hanging proud, daring out loud for any one looking to fight

I won some silver at seven card stud so I was out doin' my pals 
But the whiskey and mescal, peso cigars drove me outside for some air 
Somebody whispered ""Your life or your money"", I reached but my gun wasn't there 

I woke up face down in Amanda's back alley aware of the fool I had been 
Rushed to my pony, grabbed my Winchester and entered Amanda's again 
Where I saw my partners twirling my pistols and throwing my money around 
Blinded by anger, I jacked the lever and one of them fell to the ground 
Amanda's got silent like night in the desert, my friends stared in pure disbelief 

Amanda was kneeling beside the dead cowboy plainly expressing her grief 
And as I bowed my head a trembled shot through me my six-gun was still at my side 
I felt my pockets, there was my money, I fell to my knees and I cried 
A nightmare of mescal is all that it was for no one had robbed me at all 
I wish I was dreaming the sound of the gallows they're testing just outside

Dave Alvin,"1. I choose not to see the things that be, 
Or the miles and years that are gone.
I pay no heed to tomorrow's need,
I'm blinded by the snow and the sun,
'til all I could see is my darlin' and me,
Like young flowers bloomin' in spring.
Like flowers that grew, and no other I knew,
But the Rose of the San Joaquin.

2. The gypsies would dance, while stealing a glance
As leaves might blow in the wind.
And the fields are worked in a sweat stained shirt,
Then the workers all move on again.
And the tramps and hawkers, with stories wild, 
Beguiled a young boy's dreams,
Enticing me to leave my home, 
And the Rose of the San Joaquin. 

3. I've watched the rise of light in the sky
When the sun climbs out of the sea.
Seen giants fall in mountains tall,
Where the lumbermen cut down the trees.
I've played in the sand with the gulf coast wind,
Fell asleep in the grass tall and green.
But nowhere I've been would I go back again,
Compared to the San Joaquin.

4. Well the road back home is hard and it's long,
And the miles, they turn into years.
And the tramps and hawkers in every town,
By God, but it brings me to tears.
When I got home, I found just a flower on the mound
Where it shamed the green grasses of spring.
It grew from the grave of my darlin' little girl,
The Rose of the San Joaquin.

5. Oh see us today out on the highway,
Or asleep in the doors of the train.
See the gypsies dance with their damned old glances,
Hear the peddlers cry out their refrain.
And who's gonna care, and who's gonna share
All the joys, the sorrows we've seen?
Like ghosts, we roam, without friends or home,
These tramps, and hawkers and me.

These tramps, and hawkers and me.

Was trouble she had to handle back home
Then she gave me a number and said call any time

Do you take me for such a fool to think I'd make contact
With the one who tries to hide what he don't know to begin with

You see me on the street, you always act surprised
You say, 'how are you, good luck,' but you don't mean it

Why don't you just come out once and scream it

When it starts gettin? cold
Close my eyes for a little while and let the world
Spin out of control

Dave Alvin & the Guilty Ones,"
Night wolves moan 
The winter hills are black 
I'm all alone 
Sitting in the back 
Of a long white Cadillac 

Headlights shine 
Highway fades to black 
I'll take my time 
In a long white Cadillac 
In a long white Cadillac 

Sometime I blame it on a woman 
Why my achin' heart bleeds 
Sometimes I blame it on the money 
Sometimes I blame it on me 

Train whistle cries 
Lost on its own track 
I'll close my eyes 
I'm never coming back 
In a long white Cadillac 

Night wolves moan 
The winter hills are black 
I'm all alone 
Sitting in the back 
Of a long white Cadillac 

One time I had all that I wanted 
But it just skipped through my hands 
One time I sang away the sorrow 
One time I took it like a man 

Headlights shine 
Highway fades to black 
It's my last ride 
I'm never coming back 
In a long white Cadillac

Dave Alvin & the Guilty Ones,"I guess she put her blue dress on
And walked out late last night
Left one silk stocking 
Dangling from the bedside light
I sobered up and called her name 
Just before the dawn
I saw her footprints in the sand 
And knew that she had gone
Down the Rio Grande.

I pulled out of Albuquerque 
Prayin' I wasn't late
I got a couple cups of coffee
At some joint off the interstate
Passin' through Las Cruces
I swear I saw her car
She always said she'd go someday
But never said how far
Down the Rio Grande.

Maybe she's in Brownsville
She's got some family there
She was always talkin' ‘bout
The salty Gulf Coast air
Where the river ends
Down the Rio Grande.

I saw an old grey heron
Flyin' south against the wind
Storm clouds over Juarez
Rollin' east to the Big Bend
I drove down Highway Ninety
Through a dusty desert wind
I didn't know where it would lead me
Or if I'd find her again
Down the Rio Grande.

I lit my last cigarette
As the sky began to clear
Black mountains up ahead
A red sundown in my mirror
Lost all the border 
‘Tween the future and the past
One fading slowly
And the other comin' fast
Down the Rio Grande.

Maybe she's in Brownsville
She's got some family there
She was always talkin' ‘bout
The salty gulf coast air
Where the river ends
Down the Rio Grande.

I bought a bottle in Del Rio
And I parked on the side of the road
I stayed up all night 
Starin' at the lights of Mexico
And I walked down to border bridge
At the break of day
And I threw that empty bottle off
And I watched it float away
Down the Rio Grande.

Maybe she's in Brownsville
She's got some family there
She was always talkin ‘bout
The salty gulf coast air
Where the river ends
Down the Rio Grande
Where the river ends.

",Rio Grande [Live],2011
Dave Alvin & the Guilty Ones,"She's waiting for me when I get home from work 
But things just ain't the same 
She turns out the light and cries in the dark 
Won't answer when I call her name 
(chorus) 
On the stairs I smoke a cigarette alone 
The Mexican kids are shooting fireworks below 
Hey, baby, it's the Fourth of July 
Hey, baby, it's the Fourth of July 
  

(same as first verse) 
She gives me her cheek when I want her lips 
And I don't have the strength to go 
On the lost side of town in a dark apartment 
We gave up trying so long ago 

(repeat chorus) 

Whatever happened, I apologize 
So dry your tears and baby, walk outside 
It's the Fourth of July

Dave Anderson,"When the everywhere-eye
Asks you
Who is the emperor
Of the sky
Take the Archangel's Thunderbird

Go to Edgar Allen
In the tower of sleep
He'll tell you a story
Which makes you to creep
The echo of your cries
Is falling so deep

Rent a destroyer
And sail to Cape Cod
There lives a lion
They call him God
There is no elevator to Eden
But a hole in the sky

In shock-corridors
People are standing
With their eyes in their hands
But they don't understand
Why their confessional folding-chairs
Go into the narcotic flight of stairs

Baiting soldiers are sleeping
In the melting House of Wax
Why is the audience not taking
The insurrection-axe
Thousands of windows burst open
And the alarm bells are broken",Archangels Thunderbird,1999
Dave Anthony,"If you could see me now, you'd know how blue I've been
One look is all you'd need to see the mood I'm in.
Perhaps then you'd realize I'm still in love with you.
If you could see me now, you'd find me being brave
And trying awfully hard to make my tears behave
But that's quite impossible, I'm still in love with you.
 
You'll happen my way on some mem'rable day
And the month will be May for a while.
I'll try to smile but can I play the part
Without my heart behind the smile?
 
The way I feel for you I never could disguise
The look of love is written plainly in my eyes.
I think you'd be mine again if you could see me now.",If You Could See Me Now,1999
Dave Apollon,"When they begin the beguine
It brings back the sound of music so tender
It brings back a night of tropical splendor
It brings back a memory ever green

I'm with you once more under the stars
And down by the shore an orchestra's playing
And even the palms seem to be swaying
When they begin the beguine

To live it again is past all endeavor
Except when that tune clutches my heart
And there we are, swearing to love forever
And promising never, never to part

What moments divine, what rapture serene
Till clouds came along to disperse the joys we had tasted
And now when I hear people curse the chance that was wasted
I know but too well what they mean

So don't let them begin the beguine
Let the love that was once a fire remain an ember
Let it sleep like the dead desire I only remember
When they begin the beguine

Oh yes, let them begin the beguine, please make them play
Till the stars that were there before return above you
Till you whisper to me once more, ""Darling, I love you""
Then we suddenly know what heaven we're in
When they begin the, begin the, begin the beguine

When they begin the, begin the, begin the beguine
When they begin the beguine",Begin the Beguine,1997
Dave Apollon,"I'm a very ordinary man
Trying to work out life's happy plan
Doing unto others as I'd like to have them doing unto me

When I find a very lonely soul
Soon be-kinda-comes my only goal
I feel so much better when I tell them my philosophy

I want to be happy
But I won't be happy
Till I make you happy too.

Life's really worth living
When we are mirth giving
Why can't I give some to you

When skies are gray and you say you are blue
I'll send the sun smiling through

I want to be happy
But I won't be happy

You won't believe me that I love you only
I'd rather be lonely than happy with somebody else

You might find the night time the right time for kissing
But night time is my time for just reminiscing
Regretting instead of forgetting with somebody else
There'll be no else unless that someone is you, you, you

I let you
We broke the ties that bind
I wanted to forget you
And leave the past behind
Still, the magic of the night I met you
Seems to stay forever in my mind

And high above
The moon was new
And so was love

Feelin' tomorrow like I feel today
If I'm feelin' tomorrow like I feel today
I'll pack my truck and make my give-a-way

St. Louis woman with her diamond ring
Pulls that man around by her, if it wasn't for her and her

I got the St. Louis blues, blues as I can be
That man's got a heart like a rock cast in the sea

Like a Kentucky colonel loves his mint 'n rye

Dave Apollon,"And now the purple dusk of twilight time
Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb
Always reminding me that we're apart
You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms
The nightingale 
Tells his fairytale
Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain
My stardust melody
The memory of love's refrain.",Stardust,1997

Carry moonbeams home in a jar
And be better off than you are
Or would you rather be a mule?

A mule is an animal with long funny ears
Kicks up at anything he hears
His back is brawny but his brain is weak
He's just plain stupid with a stubborn streak
And by the way, if you hate to go to school
You may grow up to be a mule

A fish won't do anything, but swim in a brook
He can't write his name or read a book
To fool the people is his only thought
And though he's slippery, he still gets caught
But then if that sort of life is what you wish
You may grow up to be a fish
A new kind of jumped-up slippery fish

Their horns were black and shiny and their hot breath he could feel
A bolt of fear went through him as they thundered through the sky

Gee but I'd give the world to see

Recitation:
Last night 'neath a street lamp I silently stood
On the same corner back in that old neighborhood
As I gazed at the houses, unchanged by the years
In my throat came a lump and my eyes filled with tears
I looked at the lamppost, the pump and the stoop
And again I could picture us kids in a group
There was Shorty, and Yeller and Skinny and Mike
And the rich kid who had ball bearing skates and a bike
And down near the school I could see the brick wall
Where we used to go for a game of handball
And the crabby old janitor who chased us away
Say, what I wouldn't give to just see him today!

And then came the parties and dances-- that's why
We didn't notice the years going by
And the first thing we knew we were all twenty-one
But the Gang stuck together in a fight or in fun
-And then came the War- the crowds in the street
-The blast of the Bugle- the tramp of the feet
And the gang, that old gang of mine
Was the first gang that hit the Von Hindenburg line.

But the war is all over and last night as I stood
On the same corner back in that old neighborhood
I couldn't help brushing a tear from my eye
For I knew not a face in the crowds that went by
Gone forever are the pals that I love
There isn't a trace or a sign
Of that regular honest to goodness old bunch
That I call that old gang of mine",That Old Gang of Mine,2006

Blowin' 'cross the trestle,

And the moon'll hide its light
When you get the blues in the night

Sing the saddest kind o' song

From Memphis to St. Jo,
Wherever the four winds blow,

Dave Barbour Four,"Would you like to swing on a star
Carry moonbeams home in a jar
And be better off than you are
Or would you rather be a mule?

A mule is an animal with long funny ears
Kicks up at anything he hears
His back is brawny but his brain is weak
He's just plain stupid with a stubborn streak
And by the way, if you hate to go to school
You may grow up to be a mule

A pig is an animal with dirt on his face
His shoes are a terrible disgrace
He has no manners when he eats his food
He's fat and lazy and extremely rude

You may grow up to be a pig

Or would you like to swing on a star
Carry moonbeams home in a jar
And be better off than you are

He can't write his name or read a book
To fool the people is his only thought
And though he's slippery, he still gets caught
But then if that sort of life is what you wish
You may grow up to be a fish
A new kind of jumped-up slippery fish

You can be better than you are
You could be swingin' on a star",Swinging on a Star,2001

She'll take you inside
And hold you in the palm of her hand

When a woman loves a man
When a woman loves a man
She will be there to the end
When a woman loves a man

And when all you've got to give her
Is nothing more than a dream

Her mind's made up
