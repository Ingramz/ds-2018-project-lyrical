June Christy,"I need your love so badly, I love you, oh, so madly
But I don't stand a ghost of a chance with you!
I thought at last I'd found you, but other lovers surround you
And ""I don't stand a ghost of a chance with you!""
If you'd surrender just for a tender kiss or two
You might discover, that I'm the lover meant for you
And I'd be true, but what's the good of scheming
I know I must be dreaming",I Don't Stand a Ghost of a Chance With You,2001
June Christy,"My story is much too sad to be told
But practically ev'rything leaves me totally cold
The only exception I know is the case
When I'm out on a quiet spree
Fighting vainly the old ennui
And I suddenly turn and see
Your fabulous face

I get no kick from champagne
Mere alcohol doesn't thrill me at all
So tell me why should it be true
That I get a kick out of you

Some get a kick from cocaine
I'm sure that if I took even one sniff
That would bore me terrific'ly too
Yet I get a kick out of you

I get a kick ev'ry time I see
You're standing there before me
I get a kick though it's clear to see
You obviously do not adore me

I get no kick in a plane
Flying too high with some gal/guy in the sky
Is my idea of nothing to do
But I get a kick out of you",I Get a Kick Out of You,2001
June Christy,"I got a guy
He don't dress me in sable
He looks nothing like Gable
But he's mine
And I think he's too divine
I got a guy
When he starts into pet me
He's the sauce on spaghetti
He's the kind that you can't keep off you mind
I got a guy
And he's tough
He's just a gem in the rough
But when I polish him up
I swear, he'll be a Tiffany solitaire
I'm riding high
'Cause I'm happy and carefree
There is nothing can scare me
'Cause I got a guy

I got a guy
And he's tough
He's just a gem in the rough

There is nothing can scare me
'Cause I got a guy",I Got a Guy,2001
June Christy,"Yes, I guess I'll get the papers and go home
Like I've been doin' ever since we've been apart
I get some consolation when I read
Of someone elses lonely heart, yes
I wonder if you get the papers too
And if you feel as melancholy as I do
Until you're in my arms again, never more to roam
I guess I'll get the papers and go home, yes

I guess I'll get the papers and go home
Like I've been doin' ever since we've been apart
Yes, I get some consolation when I read
Of someone elses lonely heart
Mmm, I wonder if you get the papers too (bah-ba-dee-do-do-do)
And if you feel as melancholy as I do
Baby, till you're in my arms again, never more to roam
I guess I'll get the papers and go home
Yes, I guess I'll get the papers and go home",I Guess I'll Get the Papers and Go Home,2001
June Christy,"My love must be a kind of blind love
I can't see anyone but you
And dear, I wonder if you find love
An optical illusion, too?

Are the stars out tonight?
I don't know if it's cloudy or bright
Cause I only have eyes for you, dear
The moon may be high
But I can't see a thing in the sky
Cause I only have eyes for you.

I don't know if we're in a garden
Or on a crowded avenue
You are here, so am I
Maybe millions of people go by
But they all disappear from view
And I only have eyes for you",I Only Have Eyes for You,2001
June Christy,"I'm confessin' that I love you,
Tell me, do you love me too?
I'm confessin' that I need you,
Honest I do, need you every moment.
In your eyes I read such strange things,
But your lips deny they're true,
Will your answer really change things
Making me blue?

I'm afraid some day you'll leave me,
Saying ""can't we still be friends""
If you go, you know you'll grieve me,
All in life on you depends.
Am I guessin' that you love me,
Dreaming dreams of you in vain,
I'm confessin' that I love you, over again.",I'm Confessin',2001
June Christy,"I've had my moments, I will confess,
My fleeting moments of tenderness,
I sang of true love, I've played guitars,
Then found a new love 'neath tropical stars.
This time's the last time, this time it's new,
Love as a pastime for me is through,
I've had my moments, my big bad moments,
But now my one big moment is you.

I sang of true love, and I've played guitars,

But now my one big moment is you.",I've Had My Moments,2001
June Christy,"Sometimes when I feel low and things look blue
I wish a boy I had, say, one like you

Someone within her heart to build a throne
Someone who'd never part, to call my own

If you were the only girl in the world
And you were the only boy
Nothing else would matter in this world today
We could go on loving in the same old way
A Garden of Eden just made for two
With nothing to mar our joy
I could say such wonderful things to you
There would be such wonderful things to do
If you were the only girl in the world
And you were the only boy

No one I'd ever care for, dear, but you
No one I'd fancy there for to love me too

Your eyes can set me dreaming all night long
Your eyes have set me scheming, right or wrong

If you were the only girl in the world
And you were the only boy
Nothing else would matter in this world today
We could go on loving in the same old way
A Garden of Eden just made for two
With nothing to mar our joy
I could say such wonderful things to you
There would be such wonderful things to do
If you were the only girl in the world
And you were the only boy",If You Were the Only Boy,2001
June Christy,"In my solitude
You haunt me
With dreadful ease
Of days gone by

In my solitude
You taunt me
With memories
That never die

I sit in my chair
And filled with despair
There's no one could be so sad
With gloom everywhere
I sit and I stare
I know that I'll soon go mad

In my solitude
I'm afraid
Dear Lord above
Send back my love
I sit in my chair

Filled with despair
There's no one, no one
No onecould be so sad
With gloom everywhere
I sit and I stare
I know that I'll soon go mad

In my solitude
I'm afraid
Dear Lord above
Send back my love
",In My Solitude,2001
June Christy,"Beautiful miracle, pardon my lyrical rhapsody,
Can't you see? Oh, you have captured me!
Being so glamorous, now can't you be amorous just with me,
Make it soon, Cop a look at that moon.

Love is just around the corner,
Any cozy little corner,
Love is just around the corner,
When I'm around you.

I'm a sentimental mourner,
And I couldn't be forlorner,
When you keep me on that corner,
Just waiting for you.

Venus de Milo was noted for her charms,
But strictly between us,
You are cuter than Venus,
And what's more you've got arms!

Let's go cuddle in a corner,
Any cozy little corner,
Love is just around the corner,
And I'm around you.

Love is just around the corner,
Any cozy corner,
Love is just around the corner,
When I'm around you.

I'm ten times as faithful,
As all your other men,
They all are true to no one but you,
But me I'm true to ten.

Oh, let's go cuddle in a cozy corner,
Any cozy little corner,
Love is just around the corner,
And I'm around you.",Love Is Just Around the Corner,2001
June Christy,"You went away
I let you
We broke the ties that bind
I wanted to forget you
And leave the past behind
Still, the magic of the night I met you
Seems to stay forever in my mind

The sky was blue
And high above
The moon was new
And so was love
This eager heart of mine was singing
Lover where can you be

You came at last
Love had its day
That day is past
You've gone away
This aching heart of mine is singing
Lover come back to me
When I remember every little thing

You used to do
I'm so lonely
Every road I walk along
I walk along with you
No wonder I am lonely

The sky is blue
The night is cold
The moon is new
But love is old
And while I'm waiting here
This heart of mine is singing
Lover come back to me
When I remember every little thing

You used to do
I grow lonely
Every road I walk along
I walk along with you
No wonder I am lonely
The sky is blue
The  night is cold
The moon is new
But love is old
And while I'm waiting here
This heart of mine is singing
Lover come back to me","Lover, Come Back to Me",2001
June Christy,"Come on along and listen to
The lullaby of Broadway
The hip hooray and ballyhoo
The lullaby of Broadway
The rumble of a subway train
The rattle of the taxis
The daffodils who entertain
At Angelo's and Maxi's

When a Broadway baby says good night
It's early in the morning
Manhattan babies don't sleep tight
Until the dawn

Good night, baby
Good night, the milkman's on his way
Sleep tight, baby
Sleep tight, let's call it a day

Hey!

The band begins to go to town
And everyone goes crazy
You rock-a-bye your baby round
'Til everything gets hazy
Hush-a-bye, I'll buy you this and that
You hear a daddy saying
And baby goes home to her flat
To sleep all day

Good night, baby
Good night, the milkman's on his way
Sleep tight, baby
Sleep tight, let's call it a day

Listen to the lullaby
Of old Broadway",Lullaby of Broadway,2001
June Christy,"You're mean to me
Why must you be mean to me?
Gee, honey, it seems to me
You love to see me cryin'

I don't know why
I stay home each night
When you say you phone
You don't and I'm left alone.

Sing the blues and sighin'
You treat me coldly each day in the year
You always scold me

Whenever somebody is near, dear
I must be great fun to be mean to me
You shouldn't, for can't you see
What you mean to me",Mean to Me,2001
June Christy,"Melancholy lullaby,
Coming from a troubled sky,
Winging through the clinging vine
Right into this heart of mine.

Melancholy lullaby,
Listen to the night wind sigh,
How can I expect to sleep
When I lay me down to weep?

Your love has cooled
>From flame to ice,
And I've been fooled
Into a fool's paradise!

Hear the music of the rain
Beating on my window pane;
Wish that I could say goodbye
To my melancholy lullaby.",Melancholy Lullaby,2001
June Christy,"In Dublin's fair city, where the girls are so pretty
I first set my eyes on sweet Molly Malone
As she wheeled her wheelbarrow through streets broad and narrow
Crying cockles and mussels alive a-live O!

A-live a-live O! A-live a-live O!
Crying cockles and mussels alive a-live O!

She was a fishmonger and sure it was no wonder
For so were her father and mother before
And they both wheeled their barrows through streets broad and narrow
Crying cockles and mussels alive a-live O!

A-live a-live O! A-live a-live O!
Crying cockles and mussels alive a-live O!

She died of a fever and no one could save her
And that was the end of sweet Molly Malone
Now her ghost wheels her barrow through streets broad and narrow
Crying cockles and mussels alive a-live O!

A-live a-live O! A-live a-live O!
Crying cockles and mussels alive a-live O!",Molly Malone,2001
June Christy,"It must have been moonglow, way up in the blue
It must have been moonglow that led me straight to you
I still hear you sayin', ""Dear one, hold me fast""
And I keep on prayin', ""Oh Lord, please let this last""

We seemed to float right through the air
Heavenly songs seemed to come from everywhere

And now when there's moonglow, way up in the blue
I'll always remember, that moonglow gave me you

It must have been moonglow, way up in the blue
It must have been moonglow that led me straight to you

June Christy,"My sugar is so refined
He's one o' them high-class kind
He doesn't wear a hat, he wears a chapeau
He goes to see a cinema, but never a show 

My sugar is so refined
He's got a real high-class mind
He never buys a dress, it's always a frock
He always winds his timepiece up, but never his clock 

He says ""tomahto"" instead of ""tomayto""
He says ""potahto"" instead of ""potayto""
Well, you should see how he holds a cup of tea
Just two fingers while he sticks out three 

My sugar is so refined
He's one o' them high-class kind
He never shares a kiss, he lets our lips unite
But, oh, it feels like kissin' and each kiss is dynamite
I wonder what he thinks of each time I hold him tight
Oh, he's so refined

He says ""banahna"" instead of ""bananna""
He says ""piahno"" instead of ""pianna""
And you should see how he sits on his settee
With cake and coffee balanced on one knee

My sugar is so refined
He's one o' them high-class kind
He never shares a kiss, he lets our lips unite
But, oh, it feels like kissin' and each kiss is dynamite

June Christy,"It was just a night like this when it happened
I was such an unsuspecting soul
And I couldn't quite believe when it happened
Till it got beyond control 

When they met, the way they smiled
I saw that I was through
Oh, you crazy Moon
What did you do

When they kissed, they tried to say
That it was just in fun
Oh, you crazy Moon
Look what you've done

Once you promised me, you know
That it would never end
You should be ashamed
To show your funny face, my friend

And all my daydreams have gone astray
I think about the one and only
Who's bound to find me some golden day

The one I love is coming along some day
And I'll have none except the one I love
He/She may be near or ever so far away
But I'll have none except the one I love

Please don't talk about me when I'm gone

June Christy,"Would you like to swing on a star
Carry moonbeams home in a jar
And be better off than you are
Or would you rather be a mule?

A mule is an animal with long funny ears
Kicks up at anything he hears
His back is brawny but his brain is weak
He's just plain stupid with a stubborn streak
And by the way, if you hate to go to school
You may grow up to be a mule

Or would you like to swing on a star
Carry moonbeams home in a jar
And be better off than you are
Or would you rather be a pig?

A pig is an animal with dirt on his face
His shoes are a terrible disgrace
He has no manners when he eats his food
He's fat and lazy and extremely rude
But if you don't care a feather or a fig
You may grow up to be a pig

Or would you like to swing on a star
Carry moonbeams home in a jar
And be better off than you are
Or would you rather be a fish?

A fish won't do anything, but swim in a brook
He can't write his name or read a book
To fool the people is his only thought
And though he's slippery, he still gets caught
But then if that sort of life is what you wish
You may grow up to be a fish
A new kind of jumped-up slippery fish

And all the monkeys aren't in the zoo

So you see it's all up to you
You can be better than you are
You could be swingin' on a star",Swinging on a Star,2001

To hide the heart she wears on her sleeve

And the should of a child
She's always giving more than she can

And she knows how to look the other way

She'll take you inside
And hold you in the palm of her hand

When a woman loves a man
She will be there to the end

Is nothing more than a dream

Her mind's made up
To stand by you through everything

Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb
Always reminding me that we're apart
You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms

Tells his fairytale
Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain
My stardust melody
The memory of love's refrain.",Stardust,2001

Peanuts (they're nice and hot)
Peanuts (he sells a lot)
Peanuts

If you haven't got bananas don't be blue
Peanuts in a little bag are calling you
Don't waste them (no tummy ache)
You'll taste them (when you're awake)
For at the very break of day
The peanut vendor's on his way
At dawning the whistle blows
(through every city, town and country lane
You hear him sing his plaintive little strain)
And as he goes by to you he'll say
(Big jumbos) big jumbo ones
(Come buy those) peanuts roasted today
(Come buy those freshly roasted today)

If you're looking for a moral to this song
50 million monkeys can't be wrong

(Peanuts they hear him cry)
(Peanuts they all reply)
(If you're looking for an early morning treat)
(Get some double jointed peanuts good to eat)
For breakfast (or dinnertime)
For supper (most anytime)
The merry twinkle in his eye
He's got a way that makes you buy
(Each morning) that whistle blows
(Are you more than I sell)

If an apple keeps the doctor from your door
Peanuts ought to keep him from you even more

We'll eat again

In gay profusion lying there, 
Lovely ribbons, scarlet ribbons.

And light the dawn 
Look into my eyes, my love, and see

June Hutton,"It's not that you're fairer
Than a lot of girls just as pleasin'
That I doff my hat

As a worshiper at your shrine
It's not that you're rarer
Than asparagus out of season
No, my darling, this is the reason
Why you've got to be mine

You'd be so nice to come to
You'd be so nice by the fire
While the breeze on high, sang a lullaby
You'd be all that I could desire

Under stars chilled by the winter
Under an August moon burning above
You'd be so nice
You'd be paradise, to come home to and love",You'd Be So Nice to Come Home To,1994
June Hutton,"The moment I saw her face, I knew she was just my style
My only regret is we've never met for I dream of her all the while,
But she doesn't know I exist, no matter how I persist
So it's clear to see there's no hope for me,
Though I live at fifty-one thirty-five Kensington Avenue,
And she lives at fifty-one thirty three

How can I ignore the girl next door, I love her more than I can say
Doesn't try to please me, doesn't even tease me,
And she never sees me glance her way
And I thought I'm heart sore, the girl next door
Affection for me won't display
I just adore her so I can't ignore her, the girl next door",The Girl Next Door,1994
June Hutton,"I'll be seeing you in all the old familiar places
That this heart of mine embraces all day through

I'll be seeing you in every lovely summer's day
In everything that's light and gay
I'll always think of you that way

I'll find you in the morning' sun
And when the night is new
I'll be looking at the moon

June Hutton,"We kiss in the shadow, we hide from the moon
Our meetings are few and over too soon
We speak in a whisper, afraid to be heard
When people are near, we speak not a word

To kiss in the sunlight, and say to the sky
Behold and believe what you see
Behold how my lover loves me

You put your best man, even if he went to college 
With this mutation, I serve like a chef 
What do you know, I be that nigga squeezin air from your last breath 
Got you gaspin from suffocation 
Then I leave without a clue nor an explanation 
It's the mister hip hop, be	-boy, rap addict 
Static, you don't want, cause when I brings it, it get tragic 
Faggot, now put an H on your chest and handle 
Whatever comes at ya, best believe I'ma gat ya 
Now move back from this Jack, you can't touch it 
Cause if you do, you catch a buck 50 muggin 
I'm thuggish, with enough stamina to damage ya 
crew, plus jerk em like a crooked ass manager 
Corrupt indeed, my mind is the backbone of evil 
Causin me to to hurt innocent people 
Niggaz playin hard rocks on the wrong block 
Thinkin it be you until I let the nine glock 
Pa-POP, my man shitted all in his pants 
It's the same old song and dance 
And I'm out motherfuckers!

You and you and you  clap your hands 

I want  you and you and you to clap your hands  I want

I want  you and you and you to clap your hands 

Verse One: June Lover 

Make a hole  niggaz up  comin through blastin

Can I get a piece? If so point me out 

To your livest MC, without a doubt 

Hey I gets down for mine haven't you heard 

Breakin niggaz off somethin real proper word 

You can't see me, and as I appeared on the TV 

Representin Stapleton's click known as GP 

I'm bad news, rippin clowns in twos 

Take a minute to adjust, pump the Reebok shoes 

And I'm Swayze, leavin niggaz misty and hazy 

Fuckin like a mad Russian from here to Haiti 

Ladies, I keeps em locked down like bikes 

Game uptight like a boricua in some bikers 

Shorts I take none that's word to my mother 

Reputations, really makes people wonder 

Can I take em, shake em, one time 

But I won't lose composure, freeze when I froze ya 

Thirty-two below just-ice sacrifice 

to the Gods of rap, true indeed infact 

You couldn't handle, acrid pain of insane 

thoughs of seven and a half ounces of brain 

Wisdom gained nuff respect due to the righteous 

Who be building in the ciphers, clap your motherfuckin hands 

Chorus 

Verse Two: Sadat X 

I got the soul of James, with the flames on the horn 

I'm at Carnegie Hall, with a fist full of dollars 

The heavy man sings while the caged bird hollers 

From, lyrics to birds, guerilla tactics like the Serbs 

The kid want to be at the bar with the big boys 

I'll serve that ass a glass, this should be a blast 

I rhyme real fast, but I can still reach the mass 

Oh you got some heads with that lime green grass? 

Put it in the air, in war everything is fair 

And violent off the hoarse, you don't file for divorce 

On the grounds that I left a pound around in your crown 

Now Rule rip, but also Boogie Down 

I be the man on the stage like the man on the wax 

The blue collar MC with the blue collar job 

Walk around on the streets with my blue collar mob 

Train wrecks couldn't cause more damage than a runaway X 

Two-one-five line is up in your behind 

I rock from one-oh-six, all the way to one-ten 

Black puerto rican and dominican 

I came to rock for all my people and my uptown fans, c'mon 

Chorus 

Verse Three: Redman 

I endeavor, clever, Funk Doctor brings the storm weather 

you ready or not it's time to set shop up 

Lock up your doors while my metaphors make your glock pop up 

Chief unique Rocka, bitch knocka 

Fuckin up the place with unseen extremes 

Disaster that Freddy couldn't possibly imagine 

Beatin down beats like BeatNuts bruise crews 

Damage your conscience, totally fuckin your sleep up 

I need that OJ Juice in my system 

That make us income, of the victims 

Freaky deaky, blow your Platoon to Twins with Dangerous Minds 

I'm the expert mic cord strangless 

Bang the head like a car wreck collision 

My reefer, thick like boricuas, I love hittin 

The submission, go through thirty packs of rubbers 

Frankie Cutlass, use the cutters, fuck ya 

Demolish, leave most MC's jobless 

Boxin, apple cobblers, at Roy Rogers 

I make it happen, freeze Alaskans, with my armaggedeon 

Plus make Martin, get to steppin 

What cha want to do when I'm comin for you 

Run through your fuckin crew like the flu, check it

June Page,"I hear the bells
Saying Christmas is near
They ring out to tell the world
That this is the season of cheer

I hear a choir
Singing sweetly somewhere
And a glow fills my heart
I'at peace with the world
As the sound of their singing fills the air

Oh why can't every day be like Christmas
Why can't that feeling go on endlessly
For if everyday could be just like Christmas
What a wonderful world this would be

I hear a child
Telling Santa what to bring
And a smile upon his tiny face
Is worth more to me than anything

Hoping that you'll understand me one of these days.

Hello means the birth of a smile

Is smoking on your Kush, or the Sour D (Light it!)
Jus' come ride with me
Now salute eh yo
While you puff 'til your eyes get low
Now salute ooh
To all my potheads across the globe

I roll up something, nah I don't fuck with the drink
Would have wrote this verse down, but I'm too high to think
Pupils is pink
Like my nigga Spitta, I'm too fly to sink
Devin, light the stink
Let's go, I'll smoke a zone playing P3
My nigga Shiest got that E.T.,
Got a nigga sleepy, yah
I used to coast down posts
Lookin' real nonchalant
This sale, off the Audemar
You go to coppin', don't get more than one!
I go to coppin', and they throw me somethin'
It's like that
This for my piss-test failures who won't leave it alone
Shout out to Ricky Williams and Pacman Jones c'mon

All my smokers get high with me, just Marley & me
Is smoking on your Kush, or the Sour D (Light it!)
Jus' come ride with me
Now salute eh yo
While you puff 'til your eyes get low
Now salute ooh
To all my potheads across the globe

Even before I get my pad and my pen
I must have my weed, I grab my bag, then dig in
Mix my shit together so that it's all different kinds of flavors
They think I'm baking pies to distribute to the neighbors, no
I'm smoking weed, that tastes like, kinda cake-like
Bud is getting better, but the price is starting
To skyrocket, so I said fuck it, bought an Aerogarden
So I can get high, smoke big, and break even
No longer have to wait for harvest season
For strictly smoking, why do I have to push
Sitting back with a fat sack of pineapple kush
I wish a motherfucker would try to take my weed
So I take it and I stash the shit, so no one can see
Then I make it safe grab a brew to equalize it
Every day I'm smoking weed, I'm hoping soon they'll legalize it

All my smokers get high with me, just Marley & me
Is smoking on your Kush, or the Sour D (Light it!)
Jus' come ride with me
Now salute eh yo
While you puff 'til your eyes get low
Now salute ooh
To all my potheads across the globe

The bud brownies that I ate just kicking in
I got my Jordan Number Eights, black, aqua, and grape
These niggas try'na duplicate the Pilot DNA
Copycats see the big dog comin' and run away
Bitches fall through at the crib and can't get up, they want to stay
I got your old lady in my '88 Z-28
Haze got her dazed, she's stuck, she don't know what to say
I have the best week ever every seven days
In the magazine pictures, so high I might fly off the page
Rap, smoke, fly, drive, do it all with grace
For the Kush, I got a Jones like Grace
I call my house first, cause first is my place, yeah

All my smokers get high with me, just Marley & me

The time has come to travel but the road is filled with fear
This is a strange affair

And all my companions are taken away
And who will provide for me against my dying day?
I took my own provisions, but it fooled me and wasted away
This is a strange, this is a strange affair

Oh, where are my companions?
My mother, father, lover, friend and enemy
Where are my companions?
They're prisoners of death now and taken far from me
And where are the dreams I dreamed in the days of my youth?
They took me to illusion when they promised me the truth
And what do sleepers need to make them listen, 
Why do they need more proof?
This is a strange, this is a strange affair

Won't you give me an answer? 
Why is your heart so hard towards the one who loves you best? 
When the man with the answer 
Has wakened you, and warned you, and called you to the test 
Wake up from your sleep that builds like clouds upon your eyes 
And win back the life you had that's now a dream of lies

June Tabor,"There's word from the caf?
That the old mans ailin'
His eyes are pailin'
And the weather took his hands
They say the ring on his finger
Was shaped from a bone
From some white man in Missouri
That spilled whiskey on his wife

He has traveled in a sacred circle
And he has traveled on a white man's train
He's killed for hunger his buffalo brother
He's killed for anger and a white man's name

His name was Joseph Cross
And he was raised by the mission
Just one of a hundred Indian boys
That wouldn't tie his shoes
He cried the night his grandpa died
And told him in a vision
""Stay close to the ways of the rattlesnake
Stay close to the ways of the grizzly""

In the 1919
Chill of December
The bear and the rattler
Coil sleepin' hardly breathin'
It's a penny to the kitchen boy
To run get sister Lydia
""Now you tell her that old Indian
Is sleepin', hardly breathin'.""

Someone said it just weren't right
To give him a white man's funeral
Someone said they'd just as soon as not
Float him on down the river
But no one touched the ring
And no one said a thing about his chest
Where it looked like a bear had ripped him
And a rattler kissed his cheek",Joseph Cross,1992
June Tabor,"I want to vanish
This is my fondest wish
To go where I cannot be captured
Laid on a decorated dish
Even in splendor this curious fate
Is more than I care to surrender
Now it's too late

Whether in wonder or indecent haste
You arrange the mirrors and the spools
To snare the rare and precious jewels
That were only made of paste

If you should stumble upon my last remark
I'm crying in the wilderness
I'm trying my best to make it dark
How can I tell you I'm rarer than most
I'm certain as a lost dog
Pondering a sign post

Whether in wonder or indecent haste
You arrange the mirrors and the spools
To snare the rare and precious jewels
That were only made of paste

I want to vanish
This is my last request
I've given you the awful truth
Now give me my rest",I Want to Vanish,1998
June Tabor,"I'll be seeing you in all the old familiar places
That this heart of mine embraces all day through
In that small cafe, the park across the way
The children's carousel, 
The chestnut trees, the wishing well

I'll be seeing you in every lovely summer's day
In everything that's light and gay
I'll always think of you that way

I'll find you in the morning' sun
And when the night is new
I'll be looking at the moon
But I'll be seeing you
I'll find you in the morning sun
And when the night is new
I'll be looking at the moon
But I'll be seeing you",I'll Be Seeing You,2000
June Tabor,"She is watching by the poplars
Colinette with the sea-blue eyes
She is watching and longing and waiting
Where the long white roadway lies

And a song stirs in the silence
Like the wind in the boughs above
She listens and starts and trembles
For this is the first song of love

Roses are shining in Picardy
In the hush of the morning dew
Roses are shining in Picardy
But there's never a rose like you

And the roses may die with the summertime
And our roads may be far apart
But there's one rose that dies not in Picardy
That's the rose that I wear in my heart

And the years roll on for ever
Till the shadow veils their skies
But still he loves to hold her hand
And look in her sea-blue eyes

And she sees the road by the poplars
Where they met in the bygone years
And the first song of the roses
Is the last song that she hears

Roses are shining in Picardy
In the hush of the morning dew
Roses are shining in Picardy
But there's never a rose like you

And the roses may die with the summertime
And our roads may be far apart
But there's one rose that dies not in Picardy
That's the rose that I wear in my heart

",Roses of Picardy,2001
June Tabor,"Last night I heard the screaming 
Loud voices behind the wall 
Another sleepless night for me
It won't do no good to call 
The police always come late 
If they come at all 

And when they arrive 
They say they can't interfere 
With domestic affairs 
Between a man and his wife 
And as they walk out the door 
The tears well up in her eyes

Last night I heard the screaming 
Then a silence that chilled my soul 
I prayed that I was dreaming 
When I saw the ambulance in the road 
And the policeman said 
""I'm here to keep the peace 
Will the crowd disperse 
I think we all could use some sleep""",Behind the Wall [Live][#],2005
June Tabor,"Casey joins the hollow sound of silent people walking down
The stairway to the subway in the shadows down below
Following their footsteps through the neon-darkened corridors
Of silent desperation, never speakin' to a soul
The poison air he's breathin' has the dirty smell of dying
'Cause it's never seen the sunshine and it's never felt the rain
But Casey minds the arrows and ignores the fatal echoes
Of the clickin' of the turnstiles and the rattle of his chains

""Oh!"" she said, ""Casey it's been so long since I've seen you!""
""Here"" she said, ""just a kiss to make a body smile!""
""See"" she said, ""I've put on new stockings just to please you!""
""Lord!"" she said, ""Casey can you only stay a while?""

Casey leaves the under-ground and stops inside the Golden Crown
For something wet to wipe away the chill that's on his bone
Seeing his reflection in the lives of all the lonely men
Who reach for any thing they can to keep from goin' home
Standin' in the corner Casey drinks his pint of bitter
Never glancing in the mirror at the people passing by
Then he stumbles as he's leaving and he wonders if the reason
Is the beer that's in his belly, or the tear that's in his eye

""Oh!"" she said, ""I suppose you seldom think about me
""Now"" she said, ""now that you've a fam'ly of your own""
""Still"" she said, ""it's so blessed good to feel your body!""
""Lord!"" she said"" ""Casey it's a shame to be alone!""",Casey's Last Ride [Live][#],2005
June Tabor,"There are places I'll remember
All my life, though some have changed
Some forever, not for better
Some have gone and some remain
All these places had their moments
With lovers and friends, I still can recall
Some are dead and some are living
In my life, I've loved them all 

But of all these friends and lovers
There is no one compares with you
And these memories lose their meaning
When I think of love as something new
Though I know I'll never lose affection
For people and things that went before
I know I'll often stop and think about them
In my life, I'll love you more 

Though I know I'll never lose affection

June Tabor,"Saturday night at the Adam Smith Hall
The couples all move to the dance master's call
Tonight they've no problems, no worries at all
The dancing's the dancing tonight

But, oh, Monday morning it comes round too soon
The sound of the flax mill, the beat of the loom
But tonight the band's playing a romantic tune
The dancing's the dancing tonight

Her partner is perfect, he's light on his feet
The footwork is graceful, perhaps they might meet
By chance by the auld kirk or on Hunter Street
On the way to the Adam Smith hall

Walking home late by Kirkcaldy's sea wall
The sea looks so big, the sky is so tall
The fate of two people can't matter at all
Just a waltz in three quarter time",The Dancing,2007
June Valli,"You saw me crying in the chapel
The tears I shed were tears of joy
I know the meaning of contentment
I am happy with the Lord

Just a plain and simple chapel
Where all good people go to pray
I prayed the Lord that I'll grow stronger
As I live from day to day

I searched and I searched but I couldn't find
No way on earth to find peace of mind

Now I'm happy in the chapel
Where people are of one accord
Yes, we gather in the chapel
Just to sing and praise the Lord

You'll search and you'll search but you'll never find
No way on earth to find peace of mind

Take your troubles to the chapel
Get down on your knees and pray
Then your burdens will be lighter
And you'll surely find a way",Crying in the Chapel,1990

His ring
Is on my hand
But he's second best

A part

Here I stand
My ring is on her hand
But I know she's playing

But I'm second best

(How lovely the bride) His ring is on her hand
(How faithful the friend as he stands by their side) But once once I was first in her heart

Inspire me with a love
So strong
That the past (Dear Lord above)
Will depart (Let me stand by her side)

Check me out right here yo

Yo, the sun don't shine forever
But as long as it's here then we might as well shine together
Better now than never, business before pleasure
P. Diddy and the Fam, who you know do it better?

Yeah right, no matter what, we air tight
So when you hear somethin' make sure you hear it right
Don't make a ass outta yourself, by assumin'
Our music keeps you movin' what are you provin'?
You know that I'm two levels above you baby
Hug me baby, I'm a make you love me baby
Talkin' crazy, ain't gon' get you nothin' but choked
And that jealousy is only gonna leave you broke
So the only thing left now is God for these cats
And B.I.G. you know you too hard for these cats
I'm a win cause I'm too smart for these cats
While they makin' up facts (uh) you rakin' up plaques

In The Commission, you ask for permission to hit 'em
He don't like me, hit him while wifey was with him
You heard of us, the murderous, most shady
Been on the low lately, the feds hate me
The son of Satan, they say my killing's too blatant
You hesitatin' I'm in your mama crib waitin'
Duct tapin' your fam' destiny
lays in my hands, gat lays in my waist
Francis, M to the iz-H phenomenal
Gun rest under your vest by the abdominal
Rhyme a few bars so I can buy a few cars
And I kick a few flows so I can pimp a few hoes
Excellence is my presence, never tense
Never hesitant, leave a nigga bent real quick
Real sick, brawl nights, I perform like Mike
Anyone, Tyson, Jordan, Jackson
action, pack guns, ridiculous
And I'm, quick to bust, if my ends you touch
Kids or girl you touch, in this world I clutch
Two auto-matos, used to call me fatso
Now you call me Castro, my rap flows
militant, y'all faggots ain't killin' shit
Oops Crystal keep spillin' shit, you overdid it homes
You in the danger zone, you shouldn't be alone
Hold hands and say it like me
The most shady, Frankie baby, fantastic
Graphic, tryin' to make dough, like Jurassic
Park did quick to spark kids who start shit
See me, only me
The Under-boss of this holocaust
Truly yours, Frank White

Put your money on the table and get your math on
Break it down, split it up, get your laugh on
See you later Dog, I'ma get my stash on
There's a bed full of money that I get my ass on
I never lose the passion to go platinum
Said I'd live it up 'til all the cash gone
Ain't that funny, only use plastic, craft it
to make classics, hotter than acid
P-D, rollin on your tape or CD
The girl-boy killa, no team illa
The Fam-o, ammo, is every channel
We been hot for a long time burnin like a candle
What you can do is check your distribution
My songs bump in Houston like Scarface produced 'em
You ain't gotta like me, you just mad
cause I tell it how it is, and you tell it how it might be

We got the shit, Mac tight, brass knuckles and flashlights
The heaters in the two-seaters, with two Midas
Senoritas, kiss rings when you meet us
P. Diddy run the city, show no pity
I'm the witty one, Frank's the crook from the Brook'
Matty broke the neck of your coke connect
No respect squeeze off 'til all y'all diminish
Shootouts for twenty minutes, until we finish
Venice took the loot, escaped, in the Coupe
Break bread, with the 'Kiss, Peniro, Sheek Luc'
Black Rob joined the Mob, it ain't no replacin' him
Niggas step up, with just Mase and 'em
Placin' them in funerals, criminals turned aroused
The Brick City, nobody come off like P.Diddy
Business wise, I play men
Hide money on the Island Cayman, y'all just betray men
You screamin, I position, competition

Carols by the fire
Send a card and spread a little Christmas cheer
Silent night a fall of snow
Listen to the choir
Everyone is happy that it's here

For we all remember, some past December
Of tinsel and holly and people we love
Put the angel on the tree then enjoy the view
Wait until the children are asleep and then
Put together all the toys
Hide a gift or two
Wishing you were just a kid again

For we all remember, some past December
Of train sets that whistled and dolls we could name
Oh the years may change
But Christmas stays the same

Turkey and gravy and hams full of honey
Cousins you see once a year
Father's who scold you then slip you some money

Girl, it's you that I adore
Step on stage, you scream for more
Africa got rhymes galore
Snap my fingers, make you mine
If not, I'll snap a second time

You will be standing next to me

I got it like that, but you still don't understand
It comes to me natural, it comes to me easy
I just lay back and let the big beat lead me
I never work a day in my life
Single jungle brother, no kids, no wife
A hundred thousand rhymes from one band, that's many
But back where I come from, they ain't worth a penny
You've got a lot of talent, but you fail to see
You paid for yours, I got mine for free

Play in the rain and don't get wet
Walk through the desert and don't even sweat
Play in the snow and don't get cold

And every day, I used to go and get with 'em
One for every hour on the hour, one on the way while I was in the shower

In America today, I have to regret to say
Something, something is not right
And it deals with black and white

Nah, it's just society
Filled with propaganda, huh!
Why do we meander, huh?
In a zone with hate for peace
All of this B.S must cease

In a mighty big white hand

If you're Miss or if you're Mister
Listen please to this fact
Black is black is black is black

Black is black is black is black
Black is black is black is black

Way back when in '68
When brothers didn't have it great
They fought back with civil rights
That scarred the soul, it took the sight
The common foe you plainly see
On the streets or on TV
Segregation was the king
Vietnam was full in swing
Martin Luther had to shout
""Let's get out, get out, get out""
The situation sort of changed
But what really makes matters strange
Is our foe is well disguised
We don't know where our fate lies
Still and all we cannot lack
The fact that black is black is black

Black is black, is black, is black
Black is black, is black, is black

Judged by both my race and color
Don't you know we need each other?
I need you and you need me
And if not now you soon will see
My light complexion has no meaning
If you think so you're still dreaming
Wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up
There's no time for us to break up
Black is black not blue or purple

Being black is like a circle
Round and round we all will go
Where we end up I don't know, listen to me if you will
Your fantasies will get you killed
Reality is what is real, reality is black is black
I try, try to tell my people,
We all are one, created equal
Before we master, we must plan
Is that so hard to understand?

Today's the day we get together
To try to change and make things better
If not where will we be tomorrow?
Drowning in the pool of sorrow
Daylight shines but still few see
That we must fight for unity
In a picture that's fixed is black and white
Why's it both that have to fight?
Uplift the race, uplift the race
See my soul and not my face
All for one and one for all

One big scratch (that's all I ask for) here we go

Well, I'm a sure shot shooter and I'm the big shot
The big shot, yes the biggest, and I know I'm hot
Say I'm the baddest, just the baddest and I'm on the top
Sucker MC's try to stop me, but I won't stop
As I adjust and discuss all the rhymes I bust
I leave 'em all in the dust when I start the thrust
They try to catch me on the mic, but I'm hard to chase
I'm the ace in the place kickin' rhymes in your face
I'm outright, outstanding, outrageous, I'm smoking
Never play on the mic, no jivin', no joking
Not a double-talker, so I don't double-talk
Ladies clock, finger-pop to the rhythm of a hawk
But I ignore the temptation, avoid the sensation
Reputation's at stake, but I won't break
I just chill (ill) ill, let loose all my skill
I make a list of all the ladies that my skill will thrill

Now, my tasty technique tantalizes your taste
As my rhymes rock and roll right through this place
I never fade away for forfeit or fess
And my beat is a beat bound to be best
Clowns craze and chase me 'cause I'm so cool
As I ridicule the rule and fool the fool
Ignite the party, excite the crowd
I'll make the quietest person wanna go and get loud
I'll make the hot get hotter when I start to rap
And my reward for goin' off is to hear people clap
I'm a monster for music, and my means are to move
Guys and gals'll get gray when it's time to groove
I'm a sexy sucker, but the mind is sane
Having nothing to lose but only goals to gain
By my side, I'm supplied with the best of the best
Sammy B and Shazam which means there's no contest

Well, I'm an MC debater, rhyme regulator
Cool creator, rapper, not a raper
A damn good fighter, party highlighter
Lady exciter, writer, not a biter
Suckers lookin' to me, say, ""what you think they see?""
They see a fresh, fantastic, fly, funky MC
They try to study my style, use and abuse it for a while
'Til I take 'em to court and have 'em put on trial
I let Mike G judge 'em, put 'em on the case
Sammy B, you be my lawyer to put 'em to disgrace
You see, I never have to worry, 'cause they both got my back
Sammy B for the fader, Mike G for the rap

The more suckers I burn, the better suckers will learn
That Mike G is takin' his turn to earn
Havin' the time, the rhyme, I'm gonna get mine
And it pushes the thought of suckers further out of my mind
'Cause as I rhyme to my peep, suckers smoke the cheap
And butlers take down my orders from the words that I speak
Because I'm strong like a horse and loud like thunder
You mess with me, you'll be sixty feet under
In a jungle with a force, on a straight-forward course
And if you don't join the jungle, you should feel remorse (yeah)

Ah yeah, yes yes y'all and you don't stop
You keep on to the break of dawn
You keep on to the break of dawn
You gotta be on time when you bust your rhyme
And you can't be wack when you rap the rap
You gotta get on the mic and do your best
For the people in the north, south, east and west

Jungle Brother, JB for short
A bite a bit my rhyme and we almost fort
But since he was a brother I thought that'd be wrong
So I let him go, I let him run along (Run along)
I write rhymes like I come from New York City
My DJ spin the music down to the nitty gritty
When the downstairs funky five days a week
Searching and seeking for the Baby Bam beat
The African rap that comes from within us
Brothers heard about it now they wish they could've been us
We did an album with no problem
Now we working on another with another Jungle Brother
(Me) Q-tip, his name, he's into business, not into games
So Q-tip when the light turns green
Grab your bone and show them what I mean

My bone is grabbed, this is what I mean
I brag a grab, and here's the scene
Q-tip, (Q-tip) from a Tribe Called Quest
Saw the Jungle Brother's album, oh yes
So get the ducats it's coming out soon
A month after March, two before June
It's nice with Ali Shaheed Mohammed, my DJ who
Is real dominant (Mohammed, Mohammed)
He and I form the funky Tribe
If you want to get with it, just feel the vibe (Feel the vibe)
Me and Ali are extremely radiant
And to be heard like the horn of Gideon

Get it? If not you're a goner
Get wise or get something, 'cause your going to want to
Lamp, after you hear from me
The Tip from Quest my DJ's Ali
Say it from the Catskills, to the Soho
Listen to the words they say on the Promo
To the bewildered let it be said
I'll mix you up more like DJ Red
So Mike G, when the light turns red
Don't stop, proceed ahead

Go on with your
Go on with your
Go on with your
Bad self
Well, I'm going (Where?)
Straight to the treetop
Eating crazy fruit, so I can't stop
Squating here, listen to the LP
Straight Out The Jungle from the JBs
Baby Bam beat keeps the bass bottom bouncing
Suckers littering, girls ouncing
Women inching, girls pinching
Run to the record store to see if this new inventions in
Remixes, out fixes, we write it, you like it
Rap music, house music
No matter what it is, the JBs can do it

Oh ya, (etc)

Jungle Brothers,"Educated man, from the motherland
You see, they call me a star but that's not what I am
I'm a jungle brother, a true blue brother
And I've been to many places you'll never discover
Step to my side, suckers run and hide
Africa's in the house, they get petrified
You want to know why, I'll tell you why
Because they can't stand the sight of the jungle eye
They never fight or fuss, they never curse or cuss
And they just stand on the side and stare right at us
They get out of line, I put 'em on a vine
And give 'em one big push for all mankind
There ain't nuttin to it, I just go head and do it
And lay down the jungle sound and run right through it
And when I'm on the mic, I never stutter or stumble
'Cause I'm a jungle brother, straight out the jungle

Cool and quiet, but quick to start up a riot
I write the rhyme, bums assist to bite it
I wear no gold around my neck just black medallions
And sold the home of true black stallions
I don't care for fear 'cause fear fears meat
Out of ten ways of dying, the first might cheat
I'm harder than the hardest, hardest, hard can get
Africa and I, while Sammy be's on the set
I kick the rhyme to the girl and she became my pet
I lend some sucker some juice and now he's in debt
The sucker said he wasn't scared but still in all he sweat
A poor man became rich because some meeky bet
My brother's searching high and low, they'll looking for me
Where will they find me, in the J-U-N-G-L-E

It's like a jungle sometimes it makes me wonder
How I keep from going under
It's like a jungle sometimes it makes me wonder
How I keep from going under
It's like a jungle sometimes it makes me wonder
How I keep from going under
It's like a jungle sometimes it makes me wonder
How I keep from going under

Struggle to live (struggle to live) struggle to survive
Struggle (struggle) just to stay alive
'Cause inside the jungle, either you do or you die
You got to be aware, you got to have the jungle eye
Take it from a brother who knows my friend
The animals and cannibals will do you in
Cut your throat (cut your throat) stab you in the back
The untamed animal just don't know how to act
It's unbelievable (unbelievable) uncivilized (ci-civilized)
And now I'm starting to realize
Danger in the jungle, the jungle means danger (danger)
Tension intense, hearts filled wit anger (anger)
Men killing men just because of one's color
In this lifetime, I've seen nothing dumber
So I think before I make a move
Make sure my rhyme goes along wit the groove
And backing on a brother it's time to rumble

Jungle Brothers,"It's a cryin' shame, brothers takin' life as a game
Growing up against the law, but no one knows who's to blame
Dealin' drugs on the corner, you don't have to, but you wanna
A meal is hard to make, but you tell yourself you're gonna
Dealing 12 to 12, day into evening
I wonder how you continue to be grieving
Your meal is made and it's time to chill
You buy the black Mercedes Benz with the gold to the grill
Cruisin' up the ave while your friends get jealous
You find out, you quickly get restless
You buy a gun, it doesn't help but hurt you
Because your so called friend rattled on you
You're in the pen serving ten to twenty
Your boy snatched your girl and put use to your money
You're out for teen, but what does it mean?
You're just a waste young brother who lost it all on a dream

What's goin' on, I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I
Yeah, what's goin' on, I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I

My blood brother is bleeding, it's a cryin' shame
Out on the street tryin' to play the game
Formally an in-mate straight from upstate
Can't stop him now 'cause you see it's just too late
He's on the run and he's got a gun
Stay out his way unless you want some
See, he's gettin' older, a bit more bolder
Got his name written up in the 5-0 folder
A big Christmas list of all the crime's he's committed
He says he didn't do it, but we know he did it
Summons his lawyers, fingerprints, bung shots
Lookin' for my brother, yo, he's at the drug spots
Livin' off that cheap Chinese food
He says he only bumps the people when he's in the mood
Runnin' 'round with his crews and his 2-2's
I saw him last night in the prime time news
Shot and killed by an on duty Jake
His birth to the earth was a big mistake

Now, history was not my favorite subject
I used to flip through the pages and get upset
Seein' little of black and too much of the other
(They tried to brainwash you) Picture that, a jungle brother
Read this, read that, answer question three
But when I got to three, it had nothin' to do with me
Somethin' was wrong, and I knew it all along
Now tell me (please) what's goin' on

What's goin' on, I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I
Yeah, what's goin' on, I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I

Now, I've been told all the do's and don't-do-not's
My mother, hallelujah, she called the shots
She said, ""Don't play with guns and play with knives
And most of all, don't play with other people's wives
When you're walkin' down the street, pay the pushers no mind
Cause all they wanna do is put your mind on cloud nine
Put your head up high and your feet on the ground
You don't have to be like everybody else to be down
Stay in school (don't be no fool)
Don't lose your temper (and keep your cool)
Follow your heart (and not your friends)
And some of your friends (could lead you into dead ends)
The other day my father said, ""son, God bless your soul
Our life is gettin' tougher and the world is cold""
I said, daddy, daddy, daddy, what do you mean?
He said (""you ain't got nothin' 'less you got the green"")
I realize to myself things are gonna be hard
So each and every day I pray to God
I say, now I lay me down to sleep
(I give the Lord my soul to keep)
If I should die before I wake
(Take me to heaven 'cause I need a break)
But if you let me live to another morn'

Ahhh! Pleasant day in Egypt, I say
Say, what is this?

[Afrika]
A tisket, a tasket
I wonder what's in that basket
Sweet Daddy strolled by and said haven't you seen here?
That right there is Belly Dancin Dina
Now I'm all junglistcally horny
Desperate to see this fine young lady
Toot, toot, toot, pulled out my flute
Yeah, she was so cute
I said I like the way you move around
Do you want to get down?
I wanted to take her home with me
Behind the bush and up my tree
So I blowed and blowed and I kept on blowing
Hey, wait a minute, baby! Where you going?

[Mike G]
Dina! Never should have seen her
Hooked by her look now I feel like I need her
Body so pure, she's shaped like an hourglass
As I turned around I peeped out her megablast
I needed acquaintance cause I had no patience
Drugged (by her bellybutton?) no, by her radiance
The hips did dips so I did flips
The pucker of her lips could sink battleships
The basket's glowing from the diamonds' glitter
If I only had it in me to go get with her
The moment I got it I needed a casket
Cause she blew me a kiss and jumped back in the basket

[Hook]
Belly Dancin Dina!
Boy, you should have seen her
The way she moved her body
All across the dance floor
Tore me all apart, straight to my heart
And it was nothing but a freaky art

[Kool DJ Red Alert]
Live from 113th Street and Seventh Avenue
Straight out the pyramid, we gon bring to you
The live one they call Belly Dancin Dina!

[Afrika]
Well, today's the day, hooray hooray
Yippee yie yo, yippee yie yie yay
Everybody's waiting for her to arrive
Oooh, she makes my nature rise
All dressed up in her sparkling clothing
I might pass out when that basket opens
Ordinarily I'm not the kind who fiends
Could it be her cute little finger tambourines?
I don't know but it's making me hard
(How hard?) Harder by the yard
Thousands of brothers had congregated
Stone boom, waited and waited
They came in peace, they paid their funds

[Kool DJ Red Alert]
OK, Y'ALL HERE SHE COMES!

[Mike G]
I've got to go get her (Word?)
And if you got bananas I'll be glad to betcha
Push back my chair to walk across the floor
As I got closer her body shook more
My eyes were set on her jelly-like belly
And if I'm dreaming don't nobody tell me
People started standing, I started losing sight
And I was really feeling like this was my night
I dipped to one side and then to another
Ahh, I see Dina! Oooh, my brother
I made a quick to dash to put my hands on ­
Poof! Dina was gone...

[Afrika]
Where she disappeared to no one knows
All she left behind were her silky clothes
Smelled the smell of her sweet perfume
Heard a voice say: ""I'll be back real soon""
Say, say, where you going?

[Hook]",Belly Dancin' Dina,1989
Jungle Brothers,"""Breakdown...""
Round and round, upside down
Living my live underneath the ground
Never heard of and hardly seen
A whole lot of talk about the Red, Black and Green
So dirty you didn't want to deal with it
So funky you didn't want to got with it
But that's alright, no problem, cool
Sent to the Earth to educate the fool
Waiting around for my shell to crack
After that you can't hold me back
Looking out for the danger signs
Jungle Bros bringing forth a change in times
Left, right, some ask from which angle
Straight up the middle, reality's the riddle
Sending a message to the old and young
Confused about where I come from
What planet? What channel? What station?
AfriKa from the Zulu Nation...

Confused, no landing, no understanding
But I knew not to give what life was demanding
Found a new tab, thought I'd take a grab
Tired of brothers who feign to backstab
Beating a bigger drum, better days will come
And if they don't come, I'll get up and make some
First you crawl before you walk
First you think before you talk
I found in life that you wear a hard hat
Protect your mind and bad things will stay back
Vultures flocking around on corners
Snakes slide through our law and order
Years slip away and I get older
Leaves hit the ground and it gets colder
My heart pumps faster so I get bolder
That's when I ask my brother to...take over!
My mellow, Uncle Sam!

(Ladies and gentlemen, live from the Planet Rock we have the
J.Beeeeees...)

You see some listen but still don't hear
Some seem far but are real near
I climb a mountain to reach a kingdom
And if they're willing, sure I'll bring them
Think to the needy and then to the greedy
Rely on the heaven and earth to feed me
Move to the motions of the moon
(Take out your shades!) Cause the sun comes soon
To plan my day I look at the sky
I see rain and I still ask why...
Broke the airwaves, trying to make waves
Finally came through but came in mono
Frequencies I kept on fighting
Satelliting what I was writing
Three years, finally got through
Came through in stereo...
So hello everybody and how ya'll doing?
We gonna say a few words and keep on stepping
People watching to see what we would do
Live on air you heard us say to you:

The city's a jungle and we are the brothers
This so-called King Of The Jungle will run for cover
All of your minds have been set into a trance
So instead of fighting out our problems...
We order ya'll to dance!",Beyond This World,1989
Jungle Brothers,"Black Woman, mother of my earth
Black Woman, you gave me birth
You can truly see what's in me
You can help me be the best that I can be
You feed my fire when I'm on the wire
Keepin' me calm when it's gettin' higher
Sweet like sugar and hot like wine
Always keepin' ya on my mind
You're givin' my life a new light to reach for
Giving me so much how could I ask for more
Keepin' us tight when we're gettin' loose
The darker the berry the sweeter the juice
Black Woman
Recess
You started out just a little girl
Given the power to change the world
And though some of your ways to man are odd
You are the proof that there is a God
Black Woman ya are the mother of all
Black Woman ya stand so firm and tall
And as you aged mind body and soul
You became more beautiful
You are the Future you are the Wisdom
The Wisdom that the evil Forces tried to hide
But no longer will you be hidden
In my Jungle you will always exist
Your wish is my command
Yo command is my wish
And the job of the Man is to respect
Protect be fruitful and multiply
Honor and love love and honor
Until the Day She Dies
Black Woman
Recess
Love the woman's weapon
With every great man there's a woman behind him
Her womb is the chamber that produces life
Her breast provides the nutrition for growth
A guardian angel in the flesh
Representin' the man that watches over us both
Sent from the Heavens and the skies above
Black Woman it's you that I love
You are the Moon that I reach for
There's no doubt in my mind that it's you I adore

Jungle Brothers,"[Maceo]
Me, Plug Three, the one they call Baby Huey
The one that gets all the money (all the money)
Yeah, that's right

[Dove]
A fat funky fruit with a whole lot of tang
A little something called ""Doing Our Own Dang""
Breaking the beat others wished they broke
Bass line so dope that you just might choke
Don't bite off something that you can't chew
And don't trail behind when I'm coming through
Fronting the feel that you really can't feel
Cause you're trying to feel what's on my reel to reel

[Q-Tip]
A tree is growing
Can't you see what I see? A white blue fruit to boot
We count to ten before we pass the crews, now that's family
Equipped with the brothers and the sisters and the sisters and the brothers
And all others, with the funky flairs, the bugged-out hairs
It's the life of Riley, I'm really ready
Gazing at the dollar fill of rap
The cool June bugs, the wicks, the wacks
Praise the rhythms for what it beez
And praise the Lord for the JB's

[Chorus]
We're doing our own dang [Repeat: x4]

[Posdnuos]
Isn't it cool when you cut your hair
And the blood is red instead of sellout green
This is not the music for an R&B mind
This is flower intertwined with a vine
(In other words this is rose)
You see what I mean? Or see what Grandpa Bam saw
Funk we transmit is unstable
One condition if I am able to say
(Yes you may) Well hey, let's get on with it
Vocal confetti is thrown, sometimes spitted
Out the vents of hecklers and fans
Either which way they all hop on the van
The band, the band, here comes the band
The tribe of fingers all on one hand
Me, myself, and I are dark
Monie Love the mouthpiece, it's now yours to spark

[Monie Love]
Sister Monie, the only one here who missed a plane back to London
Residing with my brothers and I learned a lot from them
About the group, how to be smooth and play funky
And sometimes rated it's kind of funky, but it's cool
For we are beyond the stereotypes
Coordination crazy, but still it sounds hype
Rocking on and off beat, and I do believe I'm right (You're right)
Am I wrong? (Yeah, son)
Don't be mad, be glad I missed the plane, I'm staying
With the Brothers Jungle, Soul, and the Tribe I'm saying
Funky funky rhymes that always stay in swing
I believe we doing our own thing

[Chorus]

[Afrika]
Well my family sets all the trends
From soul to soul, large to loose ends
And I all my groups like kill? 
(Cause that's where the money's at)
Yeah, the industry's filled with copycats
R&B mixed with sloppy raps
Tribes like us always open doors
But what for, so you can get yours?
You ain't in to it, all you want is profit
So I ask you please to stop it
Leave me alone, get off my bone
Cause I'm doing my own

[Mike G]
A new seed, a new breed
A new man you to feed the greed
A new pair of boots for a new piece of butt
Sweet daddy are you there? (Sammy be	 is on the cut!)
Spinning back for a rap that's laid back
Read to kic back, those get no slack
I may rock a rhyme or I may start to sing
But still, I'm doing my own thing

[Dove]
In comes the mood of Jungle and Daisies
Play the same and let the vibes grace me
All hold hands and let's walk about
And form a circle and talk about
Don't follow the path that we're stepping
Truth to the soul is what I'm cramming
Reasons for this is that the family's strong
And like Bob Marley said ""We're jammin'""
Seeing is believing, so see and believe
And let the groove of the new proceed
A whole bunch of love, peace signs, and fun
So let's do what's got to be done, you know?",Doin' Our Own Dang,1989

Mindin my business, hangin on the scene
Kangaroos rolled by -- but I was clean
?? got my tiger skin suit
Hair braided up and my Jungle Brother boots
Hopped on the vine and swung through the city
Today's your day, said the neighborhood gypsy
Kept on jumpin to the other side of town
The place where I want to go to get down
Jam-packed and one green light
Not a crumb or crack and I'm feelin alright

Packin my gear, headin for the next show (yeah)
Coolin on the stoop, waitin for my ride
My man Keith steps to my side
Chris pulls up, Uncle Sam next to him (uh-huh)
I step to the curb he says, ""c'mon, get in!""
Grandma waved as Chris hits the gas (yeah)
My hat flew off and Keith just laughed
Afrika's with Sam, holdin on to his seat
as Sam does ninety to a new Bush beat
Arrive to the show with no time to spare
Check in the mirror run my hand through my hair
Offered drinks and drugs, to get me high
I put my hands in my pocket and passed them by

[Afrika]
Well uhh, ahh-ooooh - I stretched out and yawned
Brushed my teeth then I carried on
Got myself dressed and off to work
I got there early, the boss was happy
""Hey, good mornin Afrika
Let me show ya the surprise that I have for ya""
Pulled out a check and read out raise
and I be cold vacationed for 60 days
60 days, layin in the shade
And on top of that I'm stone cold paid
Packed the trunk of clothes and funk
Jumped on the plane, now what's my name?
Honey child, you can't tell me nothin
Out in the Motherland for two whole months
and WHOO!  Feelin alright
Uh-huh, feelin alright..

{*Afrika scats*}

[Mike G]
Home from the show and I'm layin back
Pulled an old school tape from out my rack
Tall glass of AJ and a real soft seat
as Pow-Wow rocks a rhyme to Billy Squire, Big Beat
Cool see recalls of the crowd sayin YEAH
as many hands were thrown up in the air
I've got a fine memory of a very fine night
Can't sleep a wink cause I'm feelin alright!

With the morning of the fox, that rocks the box
Expect sunshine today!
For yesterday's rain has faded far away
Now we seek a brand new day, a brand new way
Learn my brothers and sisters, learn

Nighttime fades away, on to the next day
The weatherman predicts a clear sunny Saturday
Relax laid back and feelin' the cool breeze
Positive vibes in sauce and the melodies
Gather my leaves and all my minerals
Fix myself a bowl of vegetables
Ice cold water and chopped up fruits
Gonna be a long day so I throw on my boots
Stretch out my hut and beyond the sun rises
Clouds gather round and suddenly hides it
Doubled back cause it started pourin'
Children scared of the thunder roarin'
Given the light but now there's darkness
Started with intelligence, now there's ignorance
Negative vibes now I don't feel right
I want my sunshine, I want my sunlight
Same old story, over and over

So I fight back with a native dance
Sing my song and chant my chants

Rain, rain, go away
Please come back another day
The sun will shine and now the sky is gray
Please rain, go way

The pavement sweats as a hot day sets in
I need to cool off so I find me a hydrant

Covered her up so the sun won't beat her

Real serious
The sun shinin', the guidin' light
The fire that we all attempt to fight
The only thing is you can't put it out
You blow and blow but that makes it grow
Bright around and it was made for me
A gift from God that he gave to me
You eat it and chew it, and then you swallow it
And wisdom is what you get from it
Try to stop me from gettin' mine
And you can kiss me where the sun don't shine

Explanation of the funk essential trapped in my brain  
Couldn't do it, make me wonder how a world maintain 
Got emcees frontin' total masquerade 
Screamin' toast had to touch them up with my blade 
Cut is caught brothers still fallin' to this day 
And all is face say why'd have to be this way? 
Five 'cent is the culture 
Make me pop you like a vulture 
Amplify my mic and let the rhyme take the clutcher 
The rains of the rhythms with some boom boom cat 
Not enough to break your back, just so you react. 
My counter act's my counterpart 
Takin' your heart 
You made a move to pull my plug now that ass got sparked 
All I seeing and knowing is my business and I divide to multiply 
And give thanks to most high 
24/7 brothers got to make a living 
Overcome the odds is the only decision 
Cast like my pawn with your third eye vision 
Slip up in the brain raise a sharp incision 
Streets full of clowns trying to rob your part 
When the herb come knocking send them home with a not

Crunch a problem with my luck

Cut you short and escort you to my innermost thoughts 
Dreams of fighting for my freedom in the most high courts 
But jump shots get blocked and dreams get shattered 
And when the day turns night, souls get bruised and battered. 
Cheap labor for a favor from your cotton picking neighbor, 
Got to work your ass off just to show you got flavor, 
Life savers won't help you when your breaking your back 
And Uncle Sam keep talking about raising his tax 
I look at heaven and see myself rolling in seven or eleven 
So I can recoup this suit that I'm spending 
Pray to God with divine intervention all my life 
Repent for my sins because I don't want strife 
Release from contracts to make new contacts 
The game gets played but still remains the facts 
That I got to wake up and see the brood of charades 
'Cause I'm still living in the modern age slave trade 
Rapping on holy water, 
Looking for divine order 
Life goes on, but still the rhyme gets shorter 
Seal my fate, there's no escape 
But still I'm straight, 
I'm back on track, shaking off the dead weight 
The time has come, for me to free my soul 
Grab hold of my heart and take full control 
'Cause no matter what happens when times get hard, 
I still stand my ground and use the force of God

Lace up a fattie of the greenery, bounce and check the scenery
Anticipation of the raw fills up the whole vicinity
Legendary quotes from promissory notes
Authentic fatigues wrapped around your throat
Coming hitting like a hammer
My overuse of truthful grammar might send me to the slammer
So I got my alibi, so if the DA try to make me fry
I'll poke him in his eye with a who, what, when and why
Oh no, not I, done hit you up with the jimmy so now identify
Cause whether dollars or yens, the 5-ohs always want to apprehend
A brother for doing his thing

[Afrika]
A yo! Hotshots rock spots and smoke chocolate thai
Talking about getting money till the day they die
Make money money, make money money money
Take money money, take money money money!
Suit getting chunky, well you see my pockets' fat
Enough to go around ten times and come back
Be the A double be	 on the thousand G bill
Circle it around from Brooklyn to Castle Hill
Right from the getty we caught bank from the piggy
Cause we give it to you raw down to the nitty-gritty
People acting shitty when they see me counting fifties
Buying new sneakers, ""Yo, son! Where'd you get these?!""

[Mike G]
Brush off the comp like lint after the hit
No one's seen the brothers with the three shades of tint
Only a sign they're in like Flynt and haven't reached the extent

Versatile styles bursting back and forth
>From the dealers and shakers, we fill the rhymes pages
To catch them papers we're back with flavours

Kick the lotto, that's my motto, stash the loot in the bottle
Fill my tank up with gas and then hit the throttle
Me and Mike G lamping like Lamar and Rollo
Rocking the mic, ripping shit at the Apollo
Check the promoter for my quota
Money quench my thirst like Dr Pepper soda

[Mike G]
Recognise by the ?G' at the end of the name
The aroma in the air when I spark a new flame
It was the DJs in the park that put a start to the game
That's what made me grab the mic and go seek fame
And put a shame to the emcees with styles too lame
For the treasures I lust but I fall short of, In God We Trust
But I learned that doesn't mean they can't be touched
Just if you're too slow then you might get crushed
Or bite the dust, bite the dust, bite the dust

Kick start strain but you can't find step

In your place is a stud with a bit more pep
Little less rep secret well kept
Aid her when you need every night you slept
Heard it all before can't believe it came true

Hard to see what a good party'll do
What ya gon' do? Listen to your crew
Shoulda took a better look
At who's sleeping with you

When you had it, you didn't want it
Now you ain't got it, so you want it back
When you had it, you didn't want it
Now you ain't got it, so you want it back

When you had it, you didn't want it
Now you ain't got it, so you want it back
When you had it, you didn't want it
Now you ain't got it, so you want it back

Every time I turn around you're lookin' for somethin' new
Talkin' 'bout who got to find something else to do
Who you wit' and what you want is just a fantasy
That's why I keep tellin' you your ass need to be with me

You know what I'm sayin'
That's what you want

When you had it, you didn't want it
Now you ain't got it, so you want it back
When you had it, you didn't want it
Now you ain't got it, so you want it back

When you had it, you didn't want it
Now you ain't got it, so you want it back
When you had it, you didn't want it
Now you ain't got it, so you want it back

Meany, meany, meany, meany (Say What?)

Meany, meany, meany, meany (Say What?)

Meany, meany, meany, meany, mean (Okay)

Hello it's the Soul
Troopin' in wit the Jungle patrol
And this one's about the KO's the knockouts out there
Who's holdin' my buddy
Hold up
(Wait a minute)

Now just wait
We're gonna talk about Buddy on this plate
But before we let the herd out the gate
Make sure the all the levels are straight out the jungle
(The Jungle, the Jungle, the Brothers, the Brothers)

De La Soul, from the soul
Black medallions no gold
Hangin' out wit Pos hangin' out wit Mase
Buddy buddy buddy all in my face

For the lap Jimbrowski must wear a cap
Just in case the young girl likes to clap
Ain't for the wind but before I begin
I initiate the buddy with a slap

Now for the next
I'm the Q-Tip from A Tribe Called Quest
And when I quest for the buddy I don't fess
For my jimmy wants nothin' but the best (the best)
The best (ooh wee!)
Let's stick out jimmy and see what we can catch
(Stick em up, stick em up jimmy)
Nets won't be needed unless
(Jenny wanna get right to the flesh)

(Sweet little woman, sweet little woman)

I won't lie, I love b-u-d-d-y (why)
Cause I never let it walk on by
When it comes to me and Jenny
I seem (very serious) like a Peek Freen
Buddy is the act that occurs on the lip
When Jenny and jimmy start shootin' the gift
Boy let me get shot I won't even riff

Buddy buddy, don't you know you make me go nutty
I'm so glad that you're not a fuddy duddy
Not too skinny and not too chubby
Soft like Silly Putty
Miss Crabtree I hope that you're not mad at me
Cause I told you that it was your buddy
That was making me ever so horny
Junglelistically horny

On the dial my buddy talks to me for a while
Plug Two is the

Q to her tip

On the A side and sometimes the flip
(Gotta gotta flip this record)
Buddy is the bud to my daisy tree
And the Luden to my do-re-mi
And the pleaser to my man Plug 3
(Plug 3 gets all the buddy)

Behind my bush my buddy likes the way that I push
And like a champ just knock it on out
Never ever once sellin' out
(Oh let loose the juice)
My buddy helps me to
(De La my Soul)
Keepin' jimmy in total control
Without Jimmy I'd be on a roll

(La la la l-la la la la, la la la l-la la la la)

Hey girl I heard ya lookin' for some good times
If you Quest from the Soul here's what we'll find
A whole lot of fun lots of fun together
Just like kissin' cousins (yeah that's kinda clever)
Close like bosoms, bosoms stay close
If you be my buddy I will toast
That we're like Ethel Merts and Lucille MacGillicuddy
You can be mines and I can be your buddy

The best buddy's in evening wear
Long lovin' less Tru know (he's in there)
I feel sorry for those who pay a fare (a fee) word to the D
I don't beg I just tease my buddy with my right leg
And when it's ready what's said is buddy is best in bed

Fly buddy told us all to get into a circle
Said don't worry cause I won't hurt you
All I really wanna do is freak you (she freaked us)

And I watched and then I checked my swatch
To see the time
The Soul had formed a buddy line
And that buddy was (mine all mine)

Now when Tribe, the Jungle, and De La Soul
Is at the clubs our ritual unfolds
Grab our bones and start swingin' our hands
(Then Jenny start flockin' it everywhere)
Cause Jenifa just wants to stay aware
Yo fellas should we keep her aware

Remedies for house parties stayed simple and plain
Little wine, little music, little Mary Jane
Gotta keep the lights dim, so when the people walk in
The vibe stays nice and mellow, everybody fits in
And everybody hey and ho, are gettin they groove on
The record only stops when the lights came on
Then they went back off, we continued to groove
Then somebody grabbed the mic like they had somethin to prove
It was just the spirit got em, it wouldn't let loose
There right before our eyes hip-hop was produced
The fire kept on burnin like a doggie in heat
You couldn't help to feel the flavor as you walked through the streets
Everybody had a crew on every block for blocks
This seemed to be insurance that the beat won't stop
So one day shots ring and it was no one to blame
All you thought was would it ever all be the same
But if you got the love, baby, won't a damn thing change
As long as you remember it always remains

[ CHORUS: The Holmes Brothers ]
I remember
When we used to play shoot-em-up, bang-bang
I remember
When we used to play shoot-em-up, bang-bang

[ VERSE 2: Afrika Baby Bam ]
Block parties jam-packed, the first time I heard rap
And deejays spinnin breakbeats back
These were the last good days of the ghetto
It wasn't all about bein jiggy, so save that rap for Jell-O
Down on my knees in the street playin skelly
Rushin upstairs to see _Graffiti Rock_ on the telly
With one eye on the beats droppin
I knew that one day would come when I'd be on the mic rockin
Every day after school practisin
I mixed blues smarts with street smarts, and then started battle rappin
But for me it wasn't happenin 
So I changed up my style, to the ladies been mackin
I wrote a rhyme about 'Roxanne, Roxanne'
I used to bust it out when I went to a jam
My mother read the dirty rap
She said, ""You ain't gon' go too far expressin yourself like that
Disrespectin black women
And what's gon' happen when you turn around and try to have your own children?""
So I changed up my style once again
So me and my moms could still be friends
My daddy wasn't buggin out so far
Watchin me pretend to be another rap star
Through my eyes he saw a child changin
Growin up to be a man and leave behind the shootin, bangin

[ CHORUS ]

[ VERSE 3: Afrika Baby Bam ]
Now this one goes out to the ones who set it off
And all the pioneers that made it what it was
Cause we been doin this for 25 years long
So we gotta represent and keep hip-hop strong
JBeez, we on a plateau, ain't nothin stoppin us
Will with the spirit of God, now watch it jump in us
Cause when you cut the roots off the family tree
All you leave behind is the sweet memory
Right from the start, we did it in the park
It wasn't for the money, and it came from the heart
But in these days and times, when rappers write rhymes
All we think about is signin on the dotted line
Me, I been thinkin about the way it used to be
When before you was a rapper, you became an MC
I'm proud of my heritage, and glad that we made it
I still bust rhymes without bein player-hated
Standin on the same stage, rockin with the JBeez
Was a dream come true for a brother like me
Before rap was consumed, and hip-hop was doomed
I was bangin on tables, rhymin in the lunchroom
I used to walk the street with my ghetto blaster
My brothers on the block was startin Zulu chapters
You know what I'm talkin about if you go way back
And yo, big ups to all my sisters, in the name of rap
Cause when it comes to hip-hop, you know you gotta keep it true
Take from the old, mix it with the new
I used to go by the name of MC Shazaam
But now you know me as Afrika Baby Bam

My mother went away for a month-long trip
Her and some friends on an ocean-liner ship
She made a big mistake by leaving me home
I had to roam so I picked up the phone
Dialed Ali up to see what was going down
Told him I pick him up so we could drive around
Took the Dodge Dart, a '74
My mother left a yard but I needed one more
Shaheed had me covered with a hundred greenbacks
So we left Brooklyn and we made big tracks
Drove down the Belt, got on the Conduit
Came to a toll, we paid and went through it
Had no destination, we was on a quest
Ali laid in the back so he could get rest
Drove down the road for two-days-and-a-half
The sun had just risen on a dusty path
Just then a figure had caught my eye
A man with a sombrero who was four feet high
I pulled over to ask were we was at
His index finger he tipped up his hat
""El Segundo,"" he said, ""my name is Pedro
If you need directions, I'll tell you pronto""
Needed civilization, some sort of reservation
He said a mile south, there's a fast food station
Thanks, senor, as I start up the motor
Ali said, ""Damn, tip, why you drive so far for?""

(Well describe to me what the wallet looks like)

Anyway a gas station we passed
We got gas and went on to get grub
It was a nice little pub in the middle of nowhere
Anywhere would have been better
I ordered enchiladas and I ate 'em
Ali had the fruit punch
When we finished we thought for ways to get back
I had a hunch
Ali said, ""Pay for lunch""
So I did it
Pulled out the wallet and I saw this wicked beautiful lady
She was a waitress there
Put the wallet down and stared and stared
To put me back into reality, here's Shaheed,
""Yo, Tip, man, you got what you need?""
I checked for keys and started to step
What do you know, my wallet I forget

Yo, it was a brown wallet, it had props numbers
Had my jimmy hats I got to get it man

Lord, have mercy
The heat got hotter, Ali stars to curse me
I fell bad but he makes me feel badder
Chit-chit-chatter, car stars to scatter
Breaking on out, we was Northeast bound
Jettin' on down at the speed of sound
Three days coming and three more going
We get back and there was no slack
490 Madison, we're here, Sha
He said, ""All right, Tip, see you tomorrow""
Thinking about the past week, the last week
Hands go in my pocket, I can't speak
Hopped in the car and torpe'ed to the shack
Of Shaheed, ""we gotta go back"" when he said
""Why?"" I said, ""ee gotta go

Cuando nos adorabamos más
Que hasta la golondria emigró
Presagiando el final

Qué triste luce todo sin ti

Se tiñen los colores de gris
Venga mamita, venga, dice
Hoy todo es soledad

No sé, si vuelva a verte después
No sé qué de mi vida será
Sin el lucero azul de tu ser
Que no me alumbra ya
Hoy quiero saborear mi dolor
No, no, no, no, no pido compasion ni piedad

And yet he be guilty, but still they comply
Abide by the law of “an eye for an eye”

Must be restored with the spilling of gore

Evolving for thousands of years and still no better

Pray for the madness of man to perish forever

Fiery comets rain down from heavens unknown 
Fissures and fault lines blossom and eat social order
Acid rain falls and melts all the flesh from your bone 
Corpses lay seared, flesh from bodies will smolder

It’s safe to say that our ship has now sailed
Humanity has so hopelessly failed…
Lead all to an end of sorrow and dismay
Hear my death prayer and bring forth our doomsday

Oceans are boiling 
A torrent of flames from on high
O' Armageddon
The global disease nullified

I take great solace
In knowing you all die with me
Know no conscience
Extinction will set the world free

Morality and virtues had once thrived 
History of accomplishments lost in the fight

To curse my sanity, festering within

Darkness now consumes, the end draws near
Untold agony and suffering
Nothing left to give, ashes to dust
Soul withered away, corrode to rust
Nations go to war, anarchy reigns
Soldiers writhe in pain, all of them slain
Lifeless barren lands, nothing but flies
Dilapidated, a husk of earth now lies

The earth reborn
No time to mourn
Famine and death
No chance for heaven, the dread pestilence

Nothing left to fear, all hope is lost

I am infidel, forever shall be
I will not be swayed by outdated beliefs
A doctrine that's outlined by decades of dread
Of suicide bombers and human warheads
Public beheadings, a call for payback
A blood-chilling omen, impending attack

No room for cowards
Fight where you stand!

Need to rearrange
Perverse to the core

Ignorance is bliss, facing the abyss

Stalemated struggle maintains, no chance to overcome
Hot shrapnel fragmentation, the mind has gone totally numb

Down in the trench, I lay there shaking
Wounded, psychologically breaking
Well aware, my next breath could be my last
I ponder all of the deeds from my past
Needless slaughter in appalling conditions
Worn down by a battle of attrition
Stinking corpses embrace my body
My resting place has been prearranged for me

Deep in the ditch, my body aching
Left for dead, my life forsaken
Realize that I never had a chance
I hope and pray my platoon can advance

Radar detectors, you can't catch me copper
You just upset me copper, I'm on a jet ski copper

Now if this ain't gangsta and that ain't gangsta
Then what is gangsta?
Nigga, I am gangsta, who ain't gangsta?
You ain't gangsta

Now if this ain't gangsta and that ain't gangsta
Then what is gangsta?
Nigga, I am gangsta, who ain't gangsta?
You ain't gangsta

The truth is I'm what the games been needin'
Food for thought, the fuck man you lames been eatin' them lies
I move the streets, do follow, I speed race, why?
Not through the streets 'cause police do follow, so watch 'em

These niggas throw flappy and sick, that's right
We young cold flashy and rich, plus we gun hoe
And SPZ on a bitch 'cause we don't pay for the pussy
The beef cum we don't lay for the pussy

Fuck 'em, watch 'em, got 'em, spot 'em
Pop 'em, drop 'em, lay 'em down
Now Lord, forgive us, pray for us
Gangstas, say what? We all religious
And y'all wangstas I swear you give us the shivers

Dipset, the new black panthers
The boys ask us questions, man, we do not answer
Life's too short for me to pull my pants up
I'm tryna let my nuts hang, system out the truck bang, bang

That's certified gangsta, you heard about me
Well, then you heard about gangsta
I'll beat the brace off a nigga
But I'm tryna keep the tapes off a nigga

To get rich we do whatever we have to do
And when we hit the hood our presence be grabbin' you
Foul hundreds the 7th's Avenue
And niggas feel the pressure whenever we mashin' through

Now if this ain't gangsta and that ain't gangsta
Then what is gangsta?
Nigga, I am gangsta, who ain't gangsta?
You ain't gangsta

Now if this ain't gangsta and that ain't gangsta
Then what is gangsta?
Nigga, I am gangsta, who ain't gangsta?
You ain't gangsta

You ain't gangsta, listen up, I grip a pump
Squeeze 3 and have any OG bitchin' up
Man, he a missing chump and if not the big glock
Our big shots, so doc can't stitch him up

I'm from the city where it's easy to make doe
Easy to bake hoes, it's easy to make 4's
You gettin' them pencils, the pigs and the checks know
Next week they'll have you sittin' on stake road

From HOC to CF to CF
Can't hold me, I'm prone to this BS
So imagine Bez on the phone gettin' key check
Fresh outta DC lampin' in the GS

That's how niggas do go get a clip or 2
Fifth or glock, get a block, hit the spot, flip a few
And for a brick or 2, the led I carry, shit
I'm reditary and your kids could get it too

Now if this ain't gangsta and that ain't gangsta
Then what is gangsta?
Nigga, I am gangsta, who ain't gangsta?
You ain't gangsta

Now if this ain't gangsta and that ain't gangsta
Then what is gangsta?

Dismantle your mug
A head shot have you looking like you shampoo with blood

The scandalous thugs
That go to your block, piss on the spot where your candle's put up
This ain't no damn push music
Or no hammish (?) music
This ain't party time it's army time
Ambush music
This that cripple fly, kill a guy, full blown gorilla-fied
Don't go in the club if you can't get your clip inside music
This that half a pound, back 'em down, ask around
Nobody say nuttin', cause they know they gon' get gatted down music
That pop and squeeze, lots of screams, guess what
Coppers, we ain't never forgot about Rodney King music

Let's get ready to rumble (yup)
This that gritty, gritty for shizzy y'all (yup)
For shizzy, nizzy, I'll kill a nigga, he piss me off (Ay)
Heat him down, keep the pound, see him now, beat him down
I ain't talkin' 'bout a bush when I say he'll get beat around music
He ain't actin' right, grab and fight, stab him right
Show dude old school snatches at taxes night
Sip sizzurp, smoke weed, x up, coke, please
Dope fiends, get a load of this new codeine
That music, crack music, peel a nigga cap to it
No reason at all
This music is that stupid (Ay)
It's the code of silence (no it's)
Spoken silence
Right now I am promoting violence (Ay)
Why shouldn't I get the vest and spit the thing (Ay)
When y'all promote cigarettes and nicotine (Ay)
And y'all hope we stop it
Y'all told me stop it
Y'all the ones that keep promoting violence (Ay)

[Chorus]

This the shit that the gangstas love
Stomp out a gang of bud
Squeeze off a gang of slugs
We gotta vacate the club music
That's how the gangstas does
Shanking O.J., a thug
Go get your glock, and let it pop
Just like Bacon does music
We the few left that does what we do best
This here, get clear
Illegal in the U.S.
I overdosed the injection that leave you posted and deaded
This so gangsta, they can't make a radio edit
This that act correct, cause I ain't got to pack a Tec
I could just snap my hand and have a nigga snap ya neck
This the talk is cheap, so I let the luger speak
Pump the torch, then dump the corpse off in Dawson's Creek
The O.G. killer is back
So if you're living is whack

Here, go hurt a nigga
Here, go jam a nigga

To make y'all happy with Mary J. who Puff came to get (Me)
Then who called for Total to make y'all see (Me)
Then who he called again for Special Delivery (That a be me)

But I'm sleeping alone in this wreck I own

She better not be suspicious
'Cause I'm about at the end of my rope
And she better not act too vicious

I'm a-covered in grease from my head to my feet
Hands are cut and callous

I broke down South of Dallas

I'm a happy guy when the miles go by
There ain't too much that I'm missing

So she's taken to the lessons in Waikiki
I guess she's right where she wants to be
My hillbilly hula gal

She dances with wahini's in the islands now
She's trying to do the hula but she don't know how
She's got the poniola's in her own corral
She feeds them grits and gravy at the old luau

The Blue Grass hills and the Mountain Dew
Wait till she leaves Honolulu
She better come home like she's suppose to do

Now she looks twice as good in a little grass skirt
Than overalls and a tore up shirt
But corn don't grow in lava dirt

There's smiles on the faces if the island boys
Cause her southern drawl gives a big enjoy
She can't churn butter when she's dipping that poi
My hillbilly hula gal

Now she never used to give a hoot for coconuts or taro root
She's a country gal living in the islands now
She's trying to get the hula girl to show her how

When she gets through with this fantasy
Just come on back to Tennessee
Back with me where she's suppose to be

I may have a little shimmy in this cracker box Jimmie
But I ain't never cracked up yet
The more I try to make a buck in this beat up truck
The more semi crazy I get

Yeah, I'm semi-crazy, I gotta be half nuts
To keep running up and down the road in these semi trucks
I might a had half a mind to slow it down for a time
But I'm never gonna give it up 'til I'm pushing up daisies
I'll be semi-crazy

I'm just a truck driving fool who never finished school
I got my learning at the old truck stop
They said I won't amount to much when a gear shift
And a clutch was the only education I got

I'm just an old blue collar, semi-crazy road scholar
They tell me that I'm half insane
And I've been driving so long, I got diesel in my blood
And ninety weight oil on my brain

'Cause I'm semi-crazy, yeah, 'bout half nuts
To keep running up and down the road in these semi trucks
I might a had half a mind to slow it down for a time
But I'm never gonna give it up 'til I'm pushing up daisies
I'll be semi-crazy

Everybody says we're dingy 'cause we're too semi-crazy to stop
That's the handle that were stuck with, no matter if we like it or not
Through the desert and the mountains
The sunshine, the rain and the snow
We'll be double clutching daddies 'til we're over the hill
And we're never gonna take it slow

Yeah, I'm semi-crazy, I gotta be half nuts
To keep running up and down the road in these semi trucks
I might a had half a mind to slow it down for a time
But I'm never gonna give it up 'til I'm pushing up daisies
I'll be semi-crazy

'Til they put us in the ground
They'll never shut us down
Till we're six feet under
We'll be rolling thunder

Oh yeah, hey breaker one nine
Red, you out there?
You got Lenear Junior out here
Come on back

Hey Lenear, this is old Cornbread Red
How ya doing, boy?
Well, I'm a little semi-crazy
From drivin' this truck too long but I'll be alright

Ha, ha, ha, me too
What do ya think of that, Dudley?

Never know how much I care
When you put your arms around me
I get a fever that's so hard to bear

You give me fever, when you kiss me
Fever when you hold me tight
Fever, in the the morning
Fever all through the night

Sun lights up the daytime
The moon lights up the night
I light up when you call my name
And you know I'm gonna treat you right

Juliet she felt the same
When he put his arms around her
He said ""Julie baby you're my flame""

Thou givest fever, when we kisseth
Fever with thy flaming youth
Fever, I'm afire
Fever yea I burn forsooth

Had a very mad affair
When her Daddy tried to kill him
She said ""Daddy-O don't you dare""

Fever when he holds me tight
Fever, I'm his Misses
Oh daddy won't you treat him right

Now you've listened to my story
Here's the point I have made
Chicks were born to give you fever
Be it Fahrenheit or Centigrade

They give you fever, when you kiss them
Fever if you live and learn
Fever, till you sizzle

It was as plain as the nose on my face 
That I was heading nowhere 

Then into my life came an angel of grace 
Sunlight in her hair

I want you to stay 
Seems like you're changing, don't turn me away 
don't turn me away

Now if I appear to be carefree, 
it's only to camouflage my sadness
in order to shield my pride 
I try to cover this hurt with a show of gladness
But Don't let my show convince you 
that I've been happy since you decided to go,
I need you so, I'm hurt and I want you to know
but for others I put on a show
 
Now there's some sad things known to man 
but ain't too much sadder than
the tears of a clown,
when there's no one around
 
Just like Pagliacci did
I try to keep my sadness hid
smiling in the public eye
but in my lonely room I cry 
the tears of a clown
Oh, yeah baby
 
Now, if there's a smile on my face
Don't let my glad expression
Give you a wrong impression
Don't let this smile I wear
Make you think that I don't care 
 
Now there's some sad things known to man 
but ain't too much sadder than
the tears of a clown, when there's no one around",Tears of a Clown,1999

The smell of the warm summer air
I live in a town where you can't smell a thing
You watch your feet for cracks in the pavement

Up above, aliens hover
Making home movies for the folks back home
Of all these weird creatures who lock up their spirits
Drill holes in themselves and live for their secrets

They're all uptight, uptight
They're all uptight, uptight
Uptight, uptight

I wish that they'd swoop down in a country lane
Late at night when I'm driving
Take me on board of their beautiful ship
Show me the world as I'd love to see it

I'd tell all my friends but they'd never believe me
They'd think that I'd finally lost it completely
I'd show them the stars and the meaning of life
They'd shut me away, but I'll be alright, alright

I'm just uptight, uptight
Uptight, uptight

Is there no escaping lord the memory of you oh no

And da B&J got me pissy like a baby

Filled wit all the bad memories
I'm visionin dead enemies tryin ta kill me
In my sleep, same niggaz dat I put to rest
Got me wakin up pourin down a hella sweat
The drugs got a nigga high and I can't explain
Tye and skunk playin tricks on my fuckin brain
Shit is strange 'cause I know deez muthafuckas dead
You see the murder still flash back in my head

Chorus:
Smokin dat denk, sippin dat drink
Make a nigga act kinda crazaay

Nigga it's dark, it's hard for me ta fuckin see
I guess the hash and Hennesy got da best of me
I got da urge for a snake related killin spree
Larceny, bent on da marijuana trees
Murder conracts
Collectin see note stacks, I react
And push the niggaz shit back (uh huh)
I neva new this young buck would be a lonester
'Till they hung my picture, wanted on a poster
I pack two hot glocks, fuck the holsters
Neva new this lil' G would get the most of
Robbin and stealin, then led to killin
Makin a livin 
Offa muthafuckin drug dealin
Then came beef, The Snakes was wanted in the streets
Shit got hot, my other half did a creep
Handled his business 'cause he was on his third body
Then laid low wit dis freak ass hottie

I of da Snakes
Watch for fakes and jakes
Blood money I make, transactions up state
Sparkin weed and drinkin
The buddha still got me thinkin
Thoughts o' death and all the bodies that I left
Face down, you know the routine for the cream
Means necessary
Cock suckas got buried
Nigga raise up or get blazed up
Who be da one lastin
Cock the fifth and start blastin
Try me
Die instantly, a couple o' shots is all it takes
Aim slugs to ya face
Perpetrator fraud, I kill you and ya broad
Got yo ass wishin you was out dis position

Dental records checkin my remains,it's hard to explain
First I see 'em then I don't, they disappear
First she tried to slit my throat,now she ain't there
I'm seein bitches in the mirrors behind me
But when I turn around, they hard to find 
See a little bit of weed and a little bit of greed
Make a bitch want to choke me till I bleed
Now watch a bitch breathe from dumb-dums
That some young bum had to bust just for wreck
Earn some self-respect,now should I tote a fo' pound
'Cause a clown wants my autograph
Broken off that hash I think he wants my cash
The Lexus and rings,give a sex simple and plain
But these bitches is mad an' they niggas is bad
So they scheme on a CREAM,you know
Fuck the hos,bitches is detrimental,the guns is essential

VERSE 2:(LIL KIM)
I'm having re-occurring dreams-bitches they want my CREAM
They want to be lieutenant so it seems,I can't sleep
I see an image that keeps movin round and round my bed
The shadow stops,points a Glock to my fuckin head
I grab my pillow,crack the back window
pull out the tre-8,bust three times at the gate
LORD have mercy!The devil tryin to curse me 
I keeps seeing shit that wasn't there in the first
See bitches be livin mad fad-they fuck my man
Steal out my crib,then come an' try an' shake my hand
Yeah man,breakin you down one time
I packs that shit for your ass,Chronic for your mind
I keeps it real on all you bitches,I wish you keep your mind
Off my motherfuckin riches

Time to get dressed and do my hair,once again it's on
Somebody's knockin at my door,but when I walk across the floor
Just ope' it up,the motherfucker's gone
I'm hearing voices in the back of my mind
Better grab my 2,'cause this fool might get outta line
I guess it's time to test this bullet-proof dress
From putting holes up in my chest
I'm lookin through the peep-hole to recognise the face
I see three bitches and still I got to play it safe
I hope my dress come in handy,but when I open the door
Three little girls selling candy,ya see bitches is jealous
Of Little Kim because my click is thicker than the rest of them
All I want to do is be rich and stay that bitch

The menage-a-trois around my waist 
Like Ill and Al Skratch smokin 50 sacks in the back of Ac's 
Windows cracked, so sit back relax 
Yo Vec, crush the hash, the Beretta's in the stash

What you doin with yourself? Stone heart's the way to wealth 
Indecisive thoughts make sentences get dealt 
Money makes the world go round, robbin shit 
Fuck a job shit, niggaz want cribs, bricks and spliffs 
All-wheel automobiles, traction control 
For clay roads, rollin with dough, kickin game 
On the cel with bitches on hold, that's how we roll (uhh) 
Rhymes got tight as hell so to the bank I stroll (uhh) 
Money on my mind, open lips from my eyes 
Reveal pupils shaped like dollar signs 

The world is mine! 
Niggaz frontin, feelin twelve gauge pellets 
BIG is repellant, to all that ""He say, she say"" 
We play, Russian roulette, fuck the threat 
Your whole crew's vagina, you and your co-signer 
Nigga, we rollin in eight and a halfs, TV's in the dash 
Three G's in the stash, see we love the cash 
No coke, then get some more

Niggaz don't know bout my game, they don't know 
How complex it is, baggin bitches in GS 300 Lexuses 
And the sex is for summer sports 
Passports for drug transports to remote resorts 
Bitches with Donna Karan ""Catwoman"" suits, matchin figure boots 
Haircut cute, on tops and garters like prostitutes 
My lyrics explicit 
Got bitches bringin they own condoms on the first visit 

If Biggie bring big bowls of beef 
Backin bitch niggaz down, burners bring bundles of belief 
Common thief, slash drug chief, syndicated 
Went from 10 K, to 24 K and motherfuckers hate it 
J.M. sedated, quarantined (uhh) 
BIG for President, buckin shots past the spleen

Young bitch from the street, guaranteed to stay down

Get me open while I'm cummin' down your throat
Then, you want to be my main squeeze nigga

Pull out your nine, while I cock on mine

Now you want to buy me diamonds and Armani suits
Adrienne Vitadini and Chanel 9 boots

C'mon c'mon we won't stop 
We won't stop you don't stop 

You already know that I am the man 
and I'm always right and never wrong 
You already know that I am the man 
'Cause I'm always right and never wrong 

Yo check it out 
I'm the trife one Cease you got weed let me light one 
Girls of different cultures chinese to the white ones 
Home players, wild thing girl slayers 
Cuties, big booties, big gave Coogies 
Black white beautiful ain't nuttin I won't do for you 
Backside so thick, won't fit inside a hula hoop 
Shine on me baby, pour wine on you baby 
I'ma drink it off your back, got a problem with that? 
Fellas get me, sip Christ', count fifties 
Split Phillies, girly girls they bet are you a Willie? 
It's a trife world, ain't gon be nasty, you a nice girl 
Liz Clayborne dresses, diamonds to white pearls 
Wild thing though, do lot of things low 
Make a wise man grow to a live man a show 
Only problem with the trife one is I stay low 
Blowin' lye with guys who got they eyes on my dough 

[Chorus]
We got riches, we got bitches 
You want drama, we got guns 
I'm that kid, from Harlem World 
and you know where I'm from 
Now my team, is out for cream 
and you know exactly what I mean 
So any click tryin to stop us 
is the click that gets seen 

Yo, yo, yo, Ceaser Leo, aiyyo 
Aiyyo wherever I go buy all hydro 
Lie low so I don't get harassed by five-oh 
Used to be in the red star, gettin' my head slobbed 
from the old school hoe that swallowed the egg nog 
I chill of course until I feel I'm the boss 
Until they got Lil' Cease face on the Source 
Got girls that be clever, that's on another level 
Tell me I'm your hero, Cease DeGeanero 
Need a wild thing, so the town can swing 
Pull the hair back and forth, layin' pounds of cream 
Bet Cease break your crutches with a crowded team 
Fulfillin' wishes to they misses with a thousand dreams 
I got, mouth to feed, pretty childs to breed 
If you really drinkin' babies, youse can swallow the seed 
When it come to the sex I like it better on your knees 
Fore I hit the kitty cat, gotta check it for flees 

[Chorus]

Aiyyo nobody used to speak to me 
To launch paper got me Geechie G, now every broad 
keep beepin' me, frequently, know the frequency 
Just to speak to me, yes leave with me, but recently 
Get Proposals, of Indecency, but can't cost a penny 
'Cause now I want Moore than Demi, but I ain't mousy 
Matter fact, we can get rowdy 
But only green papers with the faces arouse me 
Now I know what a woman think, but girl I'm top ten rank 
But I only get hard when I see Ben Frank in the bank 
It don't pay to baby don't show up 
But know what? Better catch me fore my price go up 
I'm a hoe slut for the dough but, I want the paper 
To come, til I throw up, so girl grow up 
You need to slow up the stash, I ain't all about us 
'Cause a nigga like Kam all I need is my cash 
I want my money.

The best that ever lived it
Cocksuckers, what's his name, huh?
That's how we do it y'all, yea
To all my niggas in the house
Bad Boy, who we die for
All day, everyday nigga

For the love of BIG, we bang out
Since my man died, we don't hang out
We blow brains out, we tear the club up, pull them things out
Mafia World, all my niggas max out
We Bad Boys, why y'all niggas cracked out
Coward niggas, most are burried down south
Far from gangstas, really hush puppies
niggas bearly speak when we discuss money
niggas stay yappin' when there's always somethin' funny
The realest niggas never took nuthin' from me
Rock ice, stay jig, fuck with niggas that got drunk, and hate kids
Got niggas on state bids, that hate movies like Rosewood and Matrix
Ayo, Biggie taught me well, Biggie told me how to flip bricks like cartwheel

To all my thugs who puffed him
To all my girls who hugged him
You love him, yell his name

I'd rather die on my feet, than live on my knees
Nigga please, I cock and squeeze for

Mafia

Representin' Bucktown
MAC 11's cocked back, niggas better duck down
Face down, you know the routine, the cream
Earings, you know the drama Biggie bring

For BIG I learn to grip aim and cock it
Once I got it, I lock it
Banger, big city boy with deep pockets
See me speak, that paper better be the topic
I like my ice frozen like the Antarctic
I'm quick to finish it, your good to start it
And with the flashy colors on, you just a target, waitin' for a hard hit
I like marine blue, marine green, roll with a mean team
Meshed out, fresh out, and stay greams
We big boys, we do big things, born in this county of kings
I ain't got shit, I spray things, take things
Fuck whenever my mood swings, from the summer for the winter to the spring
My nigga Ill's holdin' it down from the Bean 
Like BIG said, we do the real things, we still bubble and steal chains
Still tustle, still struggle, we feel pain
Still ride, still die for BIG's name

Face down, you know the routine, the cream
Earings, you know the drama Biggie bring

For BIG I grip the Sig, put six in your wig
Not 'cause of what he said, 'cause of what he did
When I hear that pop quiz, that's the way I was raised and that's the way it is for
We roll like the Panthers, show our guns on camera
Do jukes with police scanners, niggas mediocre, full of dirt like hampers
I roll with a bunch of niggas that wear bandanas and rep
We kept it thorough, from the heart rep the borough
B.K. style, see BIG howl, now
Lets see who, wanna go against Mafia World
Niggas nuthin' but squirrels, they know we rep
Niggas tryin' to get a nut, hit in the head or below the gut
Wood style roll 'em up, get plucked, nigga what
Go back to spend a ton, and know cats wit gold tooths
Know my gat will bust for my nigga

Now when I cock back and squeeze, my Desert E'z
Make you drop to your knees, barly able to breathe
My bullets move in threes, one for Brook-lyn
One for Mafia so take that, uh, and this one's for
You know Frank kept me iced out
Mink draggin', seven figures in my bank account

Iceburg sweaters with Kim name on it
Cease-A-Le Tee with big blood stain on it
Every time I sign a check, I sign a thug name on it
Niggas got rhymes but they flow's so boring
No stage shows, so forget about touring
Mad at my team cause my niggas stay scoring
All you gotta do is make a false move and it's warning
My guns bust

Rain down long like Kim gettin dressed in the morning

Run up in yah crib without a search warrant

Strap on a fake dick and stick you where you shit

I steps in where the Mo's and the hoes at bay-bee!

Takin' it back to the gutter for you motherfuckers
Niggas know the deal
Niggas know who the Don is
Live from Bedford-Stuyvesant, the livest one
Peep game, uhh, what, what

Out of this world like Mars, when I spit these bars
Come fuck with these stars up in luxury cars
We built them radars to stay free from the cops
Crucial choices to make, like A-C or the drop
Are we gonna stop?  Shit man never my squad go broke
Your squad arti-choke
Watch your circle vanish like cigar smoke
Ain't no joke, when your ones don't show
Nigga I know, might say 'Been There Done That' like Dre
Through hard work I earn the vault
Promise God to never look back or I turn to salt
Got nice watches nice cars nice bitches and rings
Guess it's safe to say a nigga like me got nice things
Can't relate to motherfuckers, who ain't go no cake
When you all fucked up, and can't get no break
When your fake ass friends, don't help you out when you need it
Be on some real bullshit, politely tell you to beat it
Fuck that, get your own nigga, don't ask me for shit
That's what I did, now they all askin' for hits
Nigga it's on for the simple fact I let it be known
We still fly but separately cause now I, charter my own
Propellers, Goodfellas, leave all them playa haters jealous
Billboard charts should tell us, they can't touch us
Why niggas bring the ruckus?
Because release day is bigger than Mandela's, motherfuckers

Yeah, make you a deal, check
These here's the dog years and motherfuckers don't shed
I try to bring you life but motherfuckers want dead
So I travel with the babble, with the chrome, with the lead
Cause when it's on, then it's on, the shots flowin' through your head
I been rich I been poor I saved and blown bread
Some say I been here before because of the way I zone
Some said, Jigga zone is like the fallin' of Rome
Reoccurring, that he thinks like that cause he's observing
Won't be known until I'm gone and niggas study my bones
Mentally been many places, but I'm Brooklyn's own
In the physical, one seems, like a lost body
In fact my thoughts don't differ much from that of God body
But it's the odd shottie, that got cats, likening me
to the mob John Gotti, rap dudes bitin' me cause
I got it locked like the late Bob Marley
Pardon me y'all, the great Bob Marley
Solemnly we mourn, all the rappers that's gone
Niggas that got killed in the field and all the babies born
Know they ain't fully prepared for this New World Order
So I keep it ghetto like sunflower seeds and quarter waters
You walk em through it, you know, talk em through it
Know these beads is more than music whenever I talk to it
Destined for greatness and y'all knew this, when I doubled the pie
Had a shorty and a girdle comin' out of B-W-I (in school)
I hated algebra but I loved to multiply
And I told my nigga Big I'd be multi' before I die
It's gonna happen whether rappin' or clappin' have it your way

And everyday they gotta fight to stay alive

Damn it feel good to see people up on it
Flipped two keys in two weeks and didn't flaunt it
My brain is haunted, with mean dreams
GS's with BB's on it, supreme schemes, to get Richer
than Richie, quickly, niggas wanna hit me
If they get me, dress my body in linen by Armani, check it
My lyrical carjack, make your brains splat
High caliber gats is all I fuck with, now peep the rough shit
in my circumference, mad bitches, with mad lucci
Bulletproof vestes under they coochie
Spittin' my Uzi, don't lose me, my trigga niggas represent
Drivin dirty in J-30's gettin' bent
And to my hit hoes, my murder mommies
I be smokin' trees in Belize when they find me
While you still killin' niggas with punany, like heiny
and Cyrus up in Cypress fuck you raw you on the floor with the virus
While I just, slang coke, smoke pounds to choke
Got lawyers watchin' lawyers so I won't go broke, now check it
Them country niggas call me Frank White
I'm squirtin' off in my loft of course I know my shit's tight
Sunrise open my eyes no surprise
Got my shorty flyin' in with keys taped to her thighs
With all the utensils, who hang my china thing
She half black half oriental eighty-six she got me rental

I can't stand this pain much longer.

cold and alone, no comfort in sight.

all that's left is an unhappy ending.

Junior Murvin,"Each day through my window I watch her as she passes by
I say to myself you're such a lucky guy,
To have a girl like her is truly a dream come true
out of all the fellows in the world she belongs to me.
But it was Just my imagination,
once again runnin' away with me.
It was just my imagination runnin' away with me. Oo
 
Soon we'll be married and raise a family (Oh yeah)
A cozy little home out in the country with two children maybe three.
I tell you I can visualize it all 
this couldn't be a dream for too real it all seems;
But it was Just my imagination once again runnin' way with me.
Tell you it was just my imagination runnin' away with me.
 
Ev'ry night on my knees I pray Dear Lord, Hear my plea;
Don't ever let another take her love from me or I would surely die.
Her love is heavenly, when her arms enfold me,
I hear a tender rhapsody; but in reality she doesn't even know me.
 
Just my imagination once again runnin' way with me.
Tell you it was just my imagination runnin' away with me.
no, no, no, no, no, no, no, can't forget her
Just my imagination once again runnin' way with me.

Junior Raglin,"Frankie and Johnny were sweethearts
Oh, what a couple in love
Frankie was loyal to Johnny
Just as true as the stars above

He was her man
But he done her wrong

Frankie went down to the drugstore
Some ice cream she wanted to buy
The soda jerk told her that Johnny
Was making love to Nellie Bligh

He was her man
But he was doing her wrong

Now Frankie's dad was a policeman
She stole his old forty-four gun
Then back to the drugstore she beat it
Just as fast as she could run

After her man
Who was doing her wrong

Now Frankie peaked in on the party
She got a surprise when she saw
That Nellie and Johnny were making love
And sipping soda through a straw

He was her man
But he was doing her wrong

So Frankie flew into a tantrum
She whipped out that old forty-four
And her rootie-toot-boom, that gal did shoot
Right through that hardwood swinging door

She shot her man
'Cause he was doing her wrong

So bring on your crepe and your flowers
Bring on your rubber-tired hack
'Cause there's eight men to go to the graveyard
But only seven are coming back

She shot her man
'Cause he was doing her wrong

Now this is the end of my story
And this is the end of my song
Frankie is down in the jailhouse
And she cries the whole night long

Junior Reid,"I am not the person who is singing 
I am the silent one inside 
I am not the one who laughs at people's jokes 
I just pacify their egos 

I am not my house or my car or my songs 
They are only just stops along my way 
I am like winter 
I'm a dark cold female 
With a golden ring of wisdom in my cave 

[Chorus]
And it is me who is my enemy 
Me who beats me up 
Me who makes the monsters 
Me who strips my confidence 

I am carrying my voice 
I am carrying my heart 
I am carrying my rhythm 
I am carrying my prayers 

But you can't kill my spirit 
It's soaring and it's strong 
Like a mountain 
I go on and on 

But when my wings are folded 
The brightly colored moth 
Blends into the dirt into the ground 

[Chorus] 

And it's me who's too weak 
And it's me who's too shy 
To ask for the thing I love 
And it's me who's too weak 

And it's me who's too shy 
To ask for the thing I love 
That I love (6 times) 
I am walking on the bridge 

I am over the water

You come from Tower Hill
One blood, one blood, one blood

I was rollin', showin my age, unshaven
Rugged with my Timberland boots that paid
I walk with a slight lean from the weight of my heat
Givin' a green to shine infra-red beam
At the street traffic light recorders
Takin pictures of our corners
Cameras on the side of the buildings, we destroy 'em
The Chameleon throws cream to children, out the window
We movin' in unmarked vans, disguised as a light tan
With plastic faces and rubber hands
Fuck fame, I shoot a hole in a 50 cent piece to test my aim
How dare you call the Gods in vain
Not knowin' the seriousness of this and why I came
To Earth, feet first
I dare you lion tame to the beat of the drum
No questionin' to the session, I walk with gun
The magnum'll bust his head from many directions unknown
Another statistic, change the ballistics
On the nozzle, make em goggle and swallow
Scrape the craters of the brain for data
Old scriptures on withered paper
Beginnin take shape and form

You coulda come from outta town, or you come from 'round town

Unrehearsed raw footage part 2 for you

He's a burnt offering, nothing up my sleeve
I'm just vanishin with the vanishin cream
Here's jewels to live by
Identify before you enter and can't leave with weed
Fuck that, we waste no time in search of those who can't breathe
A bomb only has one time to explode
When I break I'm takin' everything
Turn the city streets to Dusty Rhodes
Behold this return of the Invincible Tone

Brought me back from the dead, that's why they call him the doctor
The Math gon' drop him
And 50 ain't rocking with him no more
It's okay, I get it popping
Whole club rocking, like a '64 impala
Drink Cris, throw it up Call the shit hydraulics
Then piss in the cup Call the shit Hpnotiq
I bleed Compton, spit crack and shit chronic
And you new niggas ain't shit, but new niggas
Bathing Ape shoe niggas, I'm talking to you, niggas
Bouncing in the '64, throwing up West side, man
Sell another 5 million albums? Yes I am
Fresh like ""damn, this nigga did it again
A hundred thousand on his neck, L.A. above the brim""
Inside the lambo, the shotgun with Snoop
What would the muthafuckin West Coast be without one crip and

One blood
Blood, blood, blood, blood-blood-blood
One blood

I'm from the West side of the '64 Impala
Where niggas say ""Where you from?"" We ain't never say ""Holler""
Bandanna on the right side, gun on the left side
Niggas in New York know how to throw up the Westside
Word to Eazy
I'm so ill, believe me
I made room for Jeezy
But the rest of you niggas better be glad you breathing
All I need is one reason
I'm the king, and Dre said the West Coast need me
I don't know why you niggas keep trying me
Everybody knows I'm the heir to the Aftermath dynasty
And I ain't gotta make shit for the club
What DJ gonna turn down the thirty-eight snub?
You thirty-eight and you still rapping? Urgh
I'm 26 nigga, so is the dubs
On the '07 Hummer, hop out, no bodyguards
When the chronic smoke clear all you gon' see is -

One blood
Blood, blood, blood, blood-blood-blood
One blood

I ain't got beef with 50, no beef with Jay
What's beef when you getting head in the six-tre?
And the double Game-Chain, I keep 'em on display
Black T-shirt, so all you see is the A
Turn on the TV, and all you see is the A
You niggas better make up a dance and try to get radio play
Keep on snapping your fingers, I ain't going away
I don't regret what I spit, cause I know what I say
And niggas talking about me, they don't know when to stop
I got the Louis Vuitton belt buckle holding the Glock
No beam, no silencer - I know when to pop
Wait till Lil Jon come on and let off a shot
I have the number one billboard spot
Niggas stepped on my fingers, and I climb right back to the top
I'm B.I.G, I'm Cube, I'm Nas, I'm Pac
This ain't shit but a warning till my album drop

'bout the same time Dre dropped 2001
Three years later the album is done
Aftermath presents: Nigga Witta Attitude, Volume One
Rap critics politickin, wanna know the outcome
Ready to Die, Reasonable Doubt and Doggystyle in one
I feel like 'Pac after the Snoop Dogg trial was done
Dre behind that G series and All Eyez on Me
I watched the death of a dynasty, so I told Vibe Magazine
Workin' with Dr. Dre was a (dream)
I had visions of makin a classic, then my world turned black
Like I was starin' out of Stevie Wonder's glasses
It's kinda hard to imagine, like Kanye West
Coming back from his fatal accident to beatmaking and rapping
But, we the future, Whitney Houston told me that
And it's gon' take more than a bullet in the heart to hold me back

Blushin' in this 40 ounce, lettin' the ink from my pen bleed
Cause Martin Luther King had a (dream)
Aaliyah had a (dream), Left Eye had a (dream)
So I reached out to Kanye and (I brought you all my dreams)
(Cause I love you, I love you, I love you)

I had dreams of fuckin' a R&B bitch like Mya
When I saw that ass on the front of that King
Read the article in the magazine, she loved gangsters, loved nasty things
So I'm in the glass house having nasty dreams
Good girls never give it up
But anything is possible, if 50 fucked Vivica
Hurdled life's obstacles, found my way through the maze
Then joy turned to pain like Frankie Beverly and Maze
Used to dream of being Unsigned Hype
'til I was crushed by Dave Mays, almost let my pen fall asleep on the page
Daydreamin' yesterday, dozin' off backstage
I thought I saw Eazy talking to Jam Master Jay
So I walked over, heard Jam Master say
""It's a hard knock life, then you pass away""
They say sleep is the cousin of death, so my eyes wide open
Cause a dream is kin to your last breath

Blushin' in this 40 ounce, lettin' the ink from my pen bleed
Cause Martin Luther King had a (dream)
Aaliyah had a (dream), Left Eye had a (dream)
So I reached out to Kanye and (I brought you all my dreams)
(Cause I love you, I love you, I love you)

The dream of Huey Newton that's what I'm livin' through
The dream of Eric Wright, that's what I'm givin you
Who walked through the White House without a business suit
Compton hat, jheri curl drippin on Ronald Reagan's shoes
Gave Mike Lem my demo, came here to pay my dues
Started off with Whoo Kid, then I start blazin' Clue
It was all a dream like Big said it'd be
Don't sleep on me homey, I bring nightmares to reality
Rap phenomenon, defyin' the rules of gravity
Studied all the classics, start revisin' my strategy
Cause Marshall Mathers made it, Curtis Jackson made it
Head in the clouds, wonderin' where the hell Marvin Gaye went
How do I say this? I'm livin' for my son
But I can't figure out, why I'm at my temple with this gun
Wake up to a Jesus piece like a catholic nun
The war to be a rap legend, has just begun

Blushin' in this 40 ounce, lettin' the ink from my pen bleed
Cause Martin Luther King had a (dream)
Aaliyah had a (dream), Left Eye had a (dream)
So I reached out to Kanye and (I brought you all my dreams)
(Cause I love you, I love you, I love you)

Still run through flat-bush like the D-line

Just like a Uzi with a bing, and a 'cuzi full of steam, Suzi and Janine

So every time I see them
Man they tell me that's their song

They say I'm the bomb
They love the way the charm
Hanging from the neck
Then compliments the arm

Which compliments the ear
Then comes the gear

Its revelation and you best get right with god
Or else is waitin', the world is comin' to an end
Everyday is a storm or a flood, tsunamis, this shit ain't the norm
We got Katrina and Rita minds keep collapsing
With the fires and mud slides, I'm like whats happenin'
Got the kids in the school gettin' raped and molested
Under-funded, unprotected no wonder they tested
And the lowest percentage rate, 
In my city damn near the lowest in the state
You can equate that to the state funds 
That ain't breakin' down right,
Rich districts get more and poor ones less, and it just don't sound right
So I'm fittin' to pound right on the doors of my city hall
And kick them doors down, they killin' my city yall
We need to get my people back to where they should be
And since nobody else is gonna do it its gonna have to be me

[Chorus: Junior Reid]
If it was up to me, 
No gun, no crack, or whore could of comin' in our community
If it was up to me,
You couldn't have no war between Tupac and B.I.G
If it was up to me, 
They couldn't lock up Shyne and they couldn't lock up Emcee
If it was up to me, 
You wouldn't have no aids and you wouldn't have no H.I.V

First of all the projects is fucked up
And it ain't just with the drugs, 
We got more problems than just the dealers and thugs
They using lead based paint, and investments is killing us
We tell 'em to fix it up but they just ain't feelin' us
They rather kicks us out and tear it down to the ground
So they can put up a parking lot, a mall, or some condos
Condemn the whole place cause if you sell crack 
Shit the rest ain't do nothin' wrong, what the fucks up with that
They say one rotten apple can spoil the whole bunch 
But we talkin' bout some people not apples, this ain't lunch
Make me wanna punch a politician dead in his face
You say you represent my district, get your ass on the case
Development is good for the hood yeah thats what you tellin' us
But bitch you on the pay roll of the builders and developers
Fuck what you sellin' us, pipe dreams for suckers
You can take that around the corner to them other motherfuckers man

So much youth they sacrifice
Just to live in paradise
Play they tricks and tell they lies I know
Its hurting to see how they treat the poor
They have so much and still they still want more
I see my people everyday on the floor

[Chorus]

Its time to educate the people man, free school and college
So everybody cross the border can get the same knowledge
 education leads to jobs and jobs kill poverty
And no more poverty means we makin' money obviously
Everybody makin' money everybody smilin'
Motherfuckers ain't eatin', them motherfuckers wildin'
Matter fact speakin' of eatin' lets feed the homeless in America
Let these motherfuckers handle their own shit
How am I gonna clean your house, and mine still dirty
How am I gonna feed your kids, and mine still thirsty
And speakin' of the kids we need to spend some more time with 'em
Cant turn 'em loose in the streets, cause they dying in 'em
And all this naked ass sex man you trippin', fuck love 
Im livin life you aint gonna catch your boy slippin'
You say your boy trippin', I'm just keepin' in it G

I'm in dat Low, Low
I do it da Cali way
And when I hit Chi
People say dat I'm fly
Dey like da way I dress dey like
(Dey like my) my attire move crowds from side to side
Dey ask me how I do it and simply I reply

[Chorus]

This is why I'm hot
Catch me on da block
Every otha day
Another bitch another drop
Sixteen bars, twenty four pop
Forty four songs, nigga gimme what you got
I'm in there drivin cars 
Push 'em off da lot
I'm into shuttin stores down so I can shop
If you need a bird I can get it chopped
Tell me wat you need you know I get 'em by da flock
I call ma homie black meet on da ave
I hit wash with da money in da bag
We into big spinners
See my pimpin never dragged
Find me wit different women dat you niggaz never had
For those who say dey know me know I'm focused on ma cream
Playa you come between you'd better focus on da beam
I keep it so mean da way you see me lean
And when say I'm hot my nigga dis is what I mean

[Chorus]

This is why I'm hot
Shorty see da drop
Ask me wat I paidd and I say yea I paid a quap
And den I hit da switch dat take away da top
So chicks 'round da way dey call me cream of da crop
Dey hop in da car
I tell 'em all bout
We hit da studio dey say dey like da way I record
I gave you black train and I did you wrong
So everytime I see 'em and dey tell me dat'z their song
Dey say I'm da bomb
Dey luv da way da charm hangin from da neck
And compliments da arm which compliments da ear den comes da gear
So when I hit da room da shortyz stop and stare
Den niggaz start to hate rearrange their face
Little do dey know I keep 'em things by waistside
I reply nobody gotta die
Simliar to Lil wizzy 'cause I got dat fire

Junior Tamlins,"Last night I heard the screaming 
Loud voices behind the wall 
Another sleepless night for me
It won't do no good to call 
The police always come late 
If they come at all 

And when they arrive 
They say they can't interfere 
With domestic affairs 
Between a man and his wife 
And as they walk out the door 
The tears well up in her eyes

Last night I heard the screaming 
Then a silence that chilled my soul 
I prayed that I was dreaming 
When I saw the ambulance in the road 
And the policeman said 
""I'm here to keep the peace 
Will the crowd disperse 
I think we all could use some sleep""",Behind the Wall,2004
Junior Tucker,"Some guys have all the luck
Some guys have all the pain
Some guys get all the breaks
Some guys do nothing but complain
 
Alone in a crowd on a bus after working, I'm dreaming
The guy next to me has a girl in his arms, my arms are empty
How does it feel when the girl next to you says she loves you?
Seems so unfair when there's love everywhere but there's none for me
 
Some guys have all the luck
Some guys have all the pain
Some guys get all the breaks
Some guys do nothing but complain
Woo woo woo 
Woo woo woo
 
Someone to take on a walk by the lake Lord, let it be me
Someone who's shy, someone who'd cry at sad movies
I know I would die if I ever found out she was foolin' me
You're just a dream, and as real as it seems, I ain't that lucky
 
Some guys have all the luck
Some guys have all the pain
Some guys get all the breaks
Some guys do nothing but complain
 
All of my friends have a ring on their finger, they have someone
Someone to care for them, it ain't fair, I got no one
The car overheated, I called up and pleaded, there's help on the way
I called you collect, you didn't accept, you had nothing to say
 
Some guys have all the luck
Some guys have all the pain
Some guys get all the breaks
Some guys do nothing but complain
 
But if you were here with me
I'd feel so happy, I could cry
You are so dear to me

I never can say goodbye girl
Ooh ooh baby (don't wanna let you go girl)
I never can say goodbye, no no no, no no no
Ooh, oh I never can say goodbye girl
Ooh ooh ooh (don't wanna let you go girl)
I never can say goodbye, no no no, no no no, ooh

Never can say goodbye, no, no, no, no, now
Never can say goodbye

I keep thinking that our problems
Soon are all gonna work out
But there's that same unhappy feeling
There's that anguish, there's that doubt
It's the same old dizzy hangup
Can't do with you or without
Tell me why is it so
Don't wanna let you go

I never can say goodbye girl
Ooh ooh baby (hey baby)
I never can say goodbye, no no no, no no no
Ooh, oh I never can say goodbye girl
Ooh oh (hey baby)
I never can say goodbye, no no no, no no no, ooh
I never can say goodbye girl
Ooh ooh baby (hey baby)
I never can say goodbye, no no no, no no no
Ooh, oh I never can say goodbye girl

Junior Walker & the All-Stars,"Though you don't call anymore
I sit and wait in vain
I guess I'll rap on your door
Tap on your window pane
I want to tell you baby
The changes I've been going through
Missing you
Listen you
'Till you come back to me
That's what I'm gonna do
Why did you have to decide
You had to set me free
I'm gonna swallow my pride
I'm gonna beg you to (please baby please) see me
I'm gonna walk by meself
Just to prove that my love is true
Oh, for you baby
'Till you come back to me
That's what I'm gonna do
Living for you my dear
Is like living in a world of constant fear
In my plea, I've got to make you see
That our love is dying
Although your phone you ignore
Somehow I must explain
I'm gonna rap on your door
Tap on your window pane
I'm gonna camp on your step
Until I get through to you
I've got to change your view baby

I'm not scared of dying and I don't really care.

only my dying will tell, yeah, only my dying will tell.

All I ask of living is to have no chains on me. 
All I ask of living is to have no chains on me,

Don't want to go by the devil, don't want to go by the demon, 
don't want to go by Satan, don't want to die uneasy,
just let me go naturally.

Take a sad song and make it better
Remember to let her into your heart

You were made to go out and get her
The minute you let her under your skin
Then you begin to make it better

And anytime you feel the pain, hey Jude, refrain
Don't carry the world upon your shoulders
For well you know that it's a fool who plays it cool
By making his world a little colder

Hey Jude, don't let me down
You have found her, now go and get her
Remember to let her into your heart
