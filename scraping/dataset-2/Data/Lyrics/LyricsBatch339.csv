Hakan Falthin,"In A Sentimental Mood 
I can see the stars come thru my room
While your loving attitude
Is like a flame that lights the gloom
On the wings of ev'ry kiss 
Drift a melody so strange and sweet
In this sentimental bliss you make my 
Paradise complete
Rose pearls seem to fall
It's all like a dream to call you mine
My heart's lighter thing 
Since you made me this night a thing divine
In A Sentimental Mood 
I'm within a world so heavenly
For I never dreamt 
That you'd be loving sentimental me
In A Sentimental Mood 
I can see the stars come thru my room
While your loving attitude 
Is like a flame that lights the gloom
On the wings of ev'ry kiss 
Drift a melody so strange and sweet
In this sentimental bliss you make my 
Paradise complete
Rose pearls seem to fall
It's all like a dream to call you mine
My heart's lighter thing 
Since you made me this night a thing divine
In A Sentimental Mood 
I'm within a world so heavenly
For I never dreamt 
That you'd be loving sentimental me",In a Sentimental Mood,1995
Håkan Hagegård,"Edelweiss, Edelweiss
Every morning you greet me
Small and white clean and bright
You look happy to meet me
Blossom of snow, may you bloom and grow
Bloom and grow forever
Edelweiss, Edelweiss
Bless my homeland forever",Edelweiss,1988
Håkan Hagegård,"You dear attractive dewy-eyed idealist,
Today you have to learn to be a realist.

You may be bent on doing deed of daring due,
But up against a shark, what can a herring do?

Be wise, compromise.
Compromise, and be wise!
Let them think you're on their side, be noncommittal.
I will not bow my head to the men I despise!
You won't have to bow your head to stoop a little.
Why not learn to put your faith and your reliance,
On an obvious and simple fact of science?

A crazy planet full of crazy people,
Is somersaulting all around the sky.
And every time it turns another somersault,
Another day goes by.
And there's no way to stop it,
No, there's no way to stop it.
No, you can't stop it even if you tried.
So, I'm not going to worry,
No, I'm not going to worry,
Every time I see another day go by.

While somersaulting at a cockeyed angle,
We make a cockeyed circle 'round the sun.
And when we circle back to where we started from,
Another year has run.

And there's no way to stop it,
No, there's no way to stop it,
If the earth wants to roll around the sun.
You're a fool if you worry.
You're a fool if you worry,
Over anything but little number one.

That's you!
That's I!
And I!
And me!
That all absorbing character.
That fascinating creature.
That super special feature,
Me!

So every star on every whirling planet,
And every constellation in the sky,
Revolves around the center of the universe,
That lovely thing called, I.

And there's no way to stop it.
No, there's no way to stop it,
And I know, though I cannot tell you why (sigh).
Just as long as I'm living,
Just as long as I'm living,
There'll be nothing else as wonderful as I.
I! I! I! Nothing else as wonderful as I!",No Way To Stop It,1988
Håkan Hagegård,"An ordinary couple
Is all we'll ever be,
For all I want of living
Is to keep you close to me,
To laugh and weep together
While time goes on its flight,
To kiss you ev'ry morning
An to kiss you ev'ry night.

We'll meet our daily problems
And rest when day is done,
Our arms around each other 
In the fading sun.

An ordinary couple,
Across the years we'll ride, 
Our arms around each other
Our children by our side,
Our arms around each other.",An  Ordinary Couple,1988

Now children do re mi fa so and so on

You can sing a million different tones by mixing them up
Like this, so do la fa mi do re

Håkan Hagegård,"There's a sad sort of clanging
From the clock in the hall
And the bells in the steeple, too
And up in the nursery
An absurd little bird
Is popping out to say cuckoo
(Cuckoo, cuckoo)

Cuckoo!                                        
Regretfully they tell us
Cuckoo!                                        
But firmly they compel us
To say good bye
Cuckoo!

To you

So long, farewell
Auf Wiedersehen, goodnight
I hate to go and leave this pretty sight

So long, farewell
Auf Wiedersehen, adieu

Adieu, adieu
To you and you and you

So long, farewell
Auf Weidersehen, goodbye

We flit, we float
We fleetly flee, we fly

So long, farewell

To bed and so must I

Håkan Hagegård,"The hills are alive
With the sound of music,
With songs they have sung,
For a thousand years.
The hills fill my heart,
With the sound of music.
My heart wants to sing every song it hears.

My heart wants to beat like the wings
Of the birds that rise from the lake
To the trees.

My heart wants to sigh
Like a chime that flies
From a church on a breeze,
To laugh like a brook when it trips and falls
Over stones on its way
To sing through the night,
Like a lark who is learning to pray.

I go to the hills
When my heart is lonely.
I know I will hear
What I heard before.
My heart will be blessed
With the sound of music
And I'll sing once more.",Reprise: The Sound of Music,1988
Håkan Hellström,"Det finns en gata där alla kan mitt namn
Jag ramlar dåliga gatan fram
Och jag var full och jag var dum och jag ramla på allt
Och jag föll för nån på en fest nånstans
Och det skulle ju va dans, dans, dans!

Och det är lång väg ner
Och jag skulle aldrig ramla mer
Och jag ramlar glada Gatan fram, sen ramlar jag tillbaks igen
Nu har jag ramlat gatan klart
Men jag är ändå inte riktigt lika glad själv

För många ramlande flickor ramlar förbi
För många rammelsängar att ramla I
Människor ramlar runt på stan
Människor ramlar hårt, precis som du - och jag

Och det är lång väg ner
Och du skulle aldrig ramla mer
Och jag ramlar kär I dom som inte ens vet vem jag är
Jag har ramlat där förut, och det är mer än bara nån sorglig kliché

Och jag ramlade in på nåt diskotek
Och sen ramla jag ut, såvitt jag vet
Och jag ramla omkull och tog mig upp och sen
Ramla jag omkull igen
Ramlade in I en taxi
""Mister, visa mig den maximala hastigheten!
Vart du vill, så fort du kan
Ja, vart du vill, så fort du kan
Vart du vill så fort du kan""

Woooh!

Lång väg ner
Och du skulle aldrig ramla mer (och du skulle)
Och det är lång väg ner
Och du skulle aldrig ramla mer

Kör mig vart du vill
För jag ramlar aldrig hit igen",Ramlar,2000
Håkan Hellström,"Sluta dröm om det ljuva livet, 
Vi kommer aldrig vara med om det 
Och be aldrig mer om ursäkt, för sakerna do aldrig gjorde 
Men det äter upp dig när do ligger I din säng, 
Åh, gud det gör så ont att något så nära kan vara så långt bort 

Jag vet att det bara är fantasier 
Och nu är hon I mig, och kommer alltid vara 
Och jag vet att allt är falskt och bedrägeri 
Men det struntar jag I, för vi dansar och do har så mjuka läppar 

Åh, kom igen, Lena! Vad skulle vi annars göra? 
Kom igen, Lena! Kom igen Lena! 

Men bryt inte ihop nu, do är bara en av många, människor jag drömt om 
Och do kan inte fånga mig, och jag kan inte fånga dig, för jag vet att hela stan vill ha dig 

Exakt! 

Åh, kom igen, Lena! Vad skulle vi annars göra? 
Åh, Kom igen, Lena! Kom igen! Kom igen! 

Okej? - Okej, who! 

Jazzhuset är fullt av trix och koca-kola chiks och kicks, 
Han har skrivit det och det och hon är där från 6 till 6, 
UT på syntheseizer-golven 
NER I ljuva livet 
UPP på taken 
ÖVER staden 
UNDER fabriksmolnen, jag ser: 
Elvispojkarna som slänger upp påskliljorna 
Andra Långgatan-flickorna med hjärtat av på mitten 
När jag går runt här I feber 
Nere vid kanalerna 
Och nån dag är jag glömd här... 

(det är bara så det är, upp I taket Timo!) 

Åh, kom igen, Lena! Vad skulle vi annars göra? 
Kom igen, Lena! Kom igen! Kom igen! Kom igen!","Kom Igen, Lena! [Blåser Iväg Dig - Versjon]",2002
Håkan Hellström,"Nu lyser ängarna av sommarns alla blommor. 
Nu surrar bin, och fåglar sjunger överallt. 
Nu stryker vinden genom trädens höga kronor 
Men I min trädgård är det visset, mörkt och kallt. 
Här är det risigt och förvuxet, fult och snårigt 
Och lika hopplöst trist och grått som I mitt bröst. 
Därute doftar det av sommarns alla dofter. 
Där är det sommar, men här inne är det höst.
Jag levde lycklig här med dig och mina katter 
Ett liv I synd och utan omsorg att bli frälst. 
Försonad med min karaktär, för jag har aldrig 
Kunnat säga nej till någonting som helst. 
Och aldrig nekat mig det ena eller andra, 
Och levat livet, tills jag krossades en dag. 
Det börja med att do bedrog mig med en annan, 
En som do sa var mycket finare än jag.
Vårt gräl tog veckor, ropen blandades med gråten 
Och jag blev grundligt jämförd med din fina vän 
Tills do bekände att han givit dig på båten 
Då blev det dödstyst här I trädgården igen! 
Ifrån den stunden blev den mannen dubbelt hatad 
Han hade lekt med dig, med oss ett litet slag 
Och jag, jag kände det som även jag var ratad 
Jag ville slåss, och gick mot mitt livs nederlag
Jag hade hammaren beredd under kavajen 
När han kom ut I sidenscarf och sa: God dag! 
Kom in och slå dig ner en stund så får vi prata! 
Jag bara stammade, nu minns jag inte vad... 
Och jag blev bjuden på cognac och på cigarrer 
Och kunde inte få mig till att säga nej! 
Och när vi skiljdes var vi bästisar och bundis 
Och jag tog saker som do glömt med hem till dig!
Jag går omkring I mitt pompeji, bland ruiner 
Och jag trampar runt I resterna utav vårt liv 
Men do skall aldrig ge mig pikar om sekiner 
Och aldrig skall do bli en annans tidsfördriv! 
Nej, åt det gamla skall vi binda vackra kransar 
Och ta vårt liv och mina katter som de är. 
Och trots all kärleksbrist och trasighet och fransar; 
Dig skall jag älska livet ut, dig har jag kär!",Trubbel,2002
Håkan Hellström,"Det går en vind över vindens ängar,
det fladdrar till i en tyllgardin.
Och jag ska skriva en sommarvisa
med sol och blomdoft i melodin.
Jag ville sjunga om Katarina,
till träklangsflöjter och alcymbal
men vindens toner blir sommarns sånger,
jag bara lyssnar i björklövssal.

Det går en vind över vindens ängar,
det fladdrar till i en tyllgardin.
Och jag ska skriva en sommarvisa
med sol och blomdoft i melodin.
Det går en flicka i aspelunden,
jag har ett gulnat fotografi.
Med åren blev hon en dröm, en saga,
en ensam vandrares sympati.

Jag ville skriva en liten visa,
där ögonblick blir till evighet.
Men ord blir stumma och toner döva,
och visans tanke blir hemlighet.
Det bliver en hemlighet.

Jag vill ju bara sjunga
Jag vill ju bara sjunga

Håkan Hellström,"Jag har hört att du träffat nån 
Jag har hört att han är allt jag inte var 
Och jag hör att du är säker nu, jag vaknar med den tanken varje dag 
Och jag hör att han är den rätte 
Ja dom säger att du verkligen menar det 
Och jag hatar att jag älskar dig 
Och jag älskar dig så mycket att jag hatar mig 

Och jag skäms för att be och jag skäms för att gråta 
Mitt hjärta är ditt att förstöra, låt din vän få veta 
Och jag skäms för att säga att du är kvar i mig 
Skratta åt det, för då kanske jag kommer över det 
Hur kunde du falla när han sa, jag älskar dig, jag älskar dig så mycket att jag hatar mig 

Mina vänner säger vakna upp 
Och sluta tänk på det 
Men vad vet dom, du är nån annan än jag närmare 
Livet innan det kunde jag, utan och innan 
Jag kunde haft det så för alltid 
Men jag föll för dig och du förtjänade en nominering för rollen du spelade 

Det kommer alltid finnas en hand för dig nånstans 
Du kan sluta dina ögon och aldrig känna dig ensam 
Och alla vill ju ha dig nu 
Dom har ju väntat på det här 
Och jag hatar att jag älskar dig 
Och jag älskar dig så mycket att jag hatar mig 

Det var en gång det var en fest 
Och jag gick med nån för att hon påminde om dig 
Men sen kom gryningen, jag reste mig gick ut genom dörren 
Och jag gick genom den tidiga morgonen 
Ja, genom tidiga morgonen 

Och jag visste inte varför jag gjorde så 
Åh, jag visste inte varför 

Jag har hört att du träffat nån 
Och den här gången är du riktigt säker 
Och jag hatar att jag älskar dig 
Älskar dig så mycket att jag hatar mig",Jag Hatar Att Jag Älskar Dig Och Jag Älskar Dig Så Mycket Att Jag Hatar,2006
Håkan Hellström,"När alla clownerna
Har gått från jobben
Så visar fåglarna I träden,
Det finns ingen poäng I att vara fri längre 
För jag vet att den här natten kommer döda mig
Om jag inte får va med dig

Klubbland 
Folk säger att allt är för konsten 
Inget för berömmelsen
Men ni ser ut som dockor I kulisser 
Åh, vad jag saknar Ernst-Hugo,
För patetik är konst 
Och konst är att förstå 

Det har blivit svårt att älska, 
När all kärlek lett till besvikelse
Och compadres
Lever på gränsen till förintelse 
Compadres, ni trodde man kunde svika kärlek
Men det kan man inte

Jag vet att do är ledsen 
Jag är ledsen med 
För allt som är kvar är en dröm om vad kärlek kunde va
Jag läser aldrig Proust igen
För slutet gör för ont I mig

Håkan Hellström,"-94 hade jag ett fast jobb på Pååls bagerier
Till jag började med Tequila och blev trummis I en ny orkester
Och sen sa dem på Pååls att några skulle gå
Och det betydde Karl-Johan, Andreas och jag
Jag hade inga barn då, men Karl-Johan hade två
Så det tog hårt på honom

Det var nästan alltid svart I tankarna på Långedragspaviljongen
Där jag nästan alltid satt med pensionärerna under båtsäsongen
Och vi såg på de unga och glömska, I båtar och I varandras armar
Och tänkte ""skuld och lidande väntar på er fortfarande""

Jag har gått på knä så många år I den här staden
Men jag svär att jag hörde Frälsningsarmén sjunga om att lämna allt
Bakom sig, första gången jag såg dig
Och jag svär att jag hörde lastbilar från E4:an dundra förbi där utanför
Natten vi kysste all skit vi gått igenom här adjö

Lena ville ifrån kranarna och indieklubbarna
Det var då Lena, nu vill jag alltid stanna
Och min lille son ler mot manshororna
När vi går förbi hand I hand, åh Fiskekyrkan
Åh, ändå Hurricane
När de skrev om mig I tidningen sa du som det var
""Glöm mig aldrig Håkan, parkbänken är aldrig långt borta""

Men den gamla goda tiden, nu kommer den aldrig tillbaka
Men jag svär att varenda fyllo på varenda bänk I varenda hörn
Hälsade på oss, natten jag fann dig
Och jag svär att jag aldrig sett stjärnorna tydligare ovanför
Natten vi kysste all skit vi gått igenom här adjö

Och han bredvid
Är så stolt att ha henne nära sig
Det verkar som hon överlevt
Sen sist jag såg henne
Hon kunde va någon annan, någon bättre
Om hon slöt ögonen
Hon har bytt höghusen
Mot champagne
Och hennes nya fina vänner
Tror de vet var hon kommer från
Jag är pojken i glasögon
Hon var kär i en gång

Hon känner inte igen mig

Håkan Hellström,"Släng ner nyckeln min fina
Och få mig av den här jävla gatan
Har stått I regnet så länge att jag börjat krympa
Att drunkna är inte så illa
Om det får en att drömma och hoppas på
Att en seglande båt ska komma

Och vi går ut och brinner upp I natten
Och skyller allting på våra fyllehuven
Undanflykter och självanklagan
Jag ser domen I dina ögon
Jag ser domen I dina ögon

Du kanske kommer förstå

Ser hela stan sjunka
Som titanic med alla ljusen tända
Åååh, en sån där natt då vi behöver någonting
Som hjälper en över svarta vatten

Håkan Hellström,"Jag är sexton år
Jag är platsen dom aldrig upptäckte
Jag är en storm från ingenstans
Jag kan krossa ditt hjärta

Som en orkan kan jag svepa bort dig
Men jag tänker aldrig dö, nej
Det kommer aldrig va över för mig

Jag kommer älska dig när jorden gått under
För jag tänker aldrig dö, nej
Det kommer aldrig va över för mig

Jag är tjugofyra
Bara en liten gnista
Bara ett ord kan sätta eld på en skog

Jag kan älska dig just som den där elden
Men jag tänker aldrig dö, nej
Det kommer aldrig va över för mig

Jag kan bränna dig som du aldrig bränt dig
Om du leker med mig
Det kommer aldrig va över för mig

Jag är trettionio
Jag är ett tappat självförtroende
En pojke från förr är tillbaks igen
Han bara står där
Och stirrar mig rakt ner i själen

Vi skulle älska varandra tills jorden gick under
Och du skulle aldrig dö, nej.
Det skulle aldrig va över för dig

Jag kommer älska dig när jorden gått under
För jag tänker aldrig dö, nej
Det kommer aldrig va över för mig",Det kommer aldrig va över för mig,2014

Hakan Sund,"Somewhere over the rainbow, way up high
There's a land that I've heard of once in a lullaby.
Somewhere over the rainbow, skies are blue
And the dreams that you dare to dream,
Really do come true.

Someday I'll wish upon a star
And wake up where the clouds are far behind me.
Where troubles melt like lemon drops,
High above the chimney tops,
That's where you'll find me.

Somewhere over the rainbow, blue birds fly
Birds fly over the rainbow
Why then, oh why can't I?
If happy little bluebirds fly beyond the rainbow
Why, oh why can't I?

Somewhere over the rainbow, way up high
There's a land that I've heard of once in a lullaby.
Somewhere over the rainbow, skies are blue
And the dreams that you dare to dream,
Really do come true.

Someday I'll wish upon a star
And wake up where the clouds are far behind me.
Where troubles melt like lemon drops,
High above the chimney tops,
That's where you'll find me.

Somewhere over the rainbow, blue birds fly
Birds fly over the rainbow
Why then, oh why can't I?
If happy little bluebirds fly beyond the rainbow

Hakeem,"I will be the one to love and comfort you 
From now until the day I die 
I will take you places that you only think 
About when you're asleep at night 
Let me take the time to understand 
And I will 
Set your spirit free 

If you get down on me 
I'll get down on you 
I will do anything 
That you want me to 
It's a game of give and take 
To make it through 
So if you get down on me 
I'll get down on you tonight 

Nighttime turns to day again 
And you are on my mind 
Winter turns to spring and then 
Life has passed you by 
Right now we are so young and free 
But we're runnin' out of time 
So while we've got each other here 
Let's treat our bodies right 

I want to know exactly what to do, so that 
You'll never get me off of your mind 
Communicate and I'll go under cover, gonna 
Make you come tonight 
Over to my house 

I'm not the type to change your mind 
If you want to take it slow 
No pressure to go all the way 
There are often places we can go 

Anytime is the right time to reveal it, when 
Two people fall as deep as you and me 
I want to know every inch of your body so I 
Can set you spirit free 

I will be the one to love and comfort you 
From now until the day I die 
I will take you places that you only think 
About when you're asleep at night 
If you open up to me I'll make you realize 
The things that you could never see 
Let me take the time to understand and I will 
Set you free",Get Down,2003
Hakeem Seriki,"I was sitting back, and I was thinking man
I ain't even trying to deal with this shit no more, you know
Cham' I don't know what to do yo, ya know
Seem like everytime a nigga make one step man
Nigga take two steps back, you feel me

They told me that pain was just in the frame, the irony of that
Cause that was the slogan showing, when they tried to see my tats
Never knew what was in the skin, would finally be a fact
Feeling like mother nature's, right behind me with a gat
Take that, the rain's loud on the window when it taps
To hell with the time, I thought that I could finally be relaxed
Tired of being po', yeah trying to leave the rats
Walk out to see three of your tires, that be on flat
And that one tire, left a sign of hope
That helps you to keep on grinding, when you kinda broke
That helps you to keep composure, up around your folk
That keeps from trying to wrap a rope, around your throat
Don't choke, you feeling like giving up
Life isn't a million bucks, you feeling like living sucks
God's telling you hear your boy, but you don't wanna give him trust
Mama telling you pay your tithes, and you yell at her back, ""for what""
So the pastor can ride faster, to get some rims on his truck
I don't think that they'll miss, ten percent of negative bucks
Put some Henny up in your cup, your problems will start to drown
But soon as your buzz leaves, then problems come back around damn

Keep your head up is what they telling me
, well it betta be
Sorry but the world keeps stressing me
Rain drops cloudin up the memories
It's gonna be alright is what they telling me
Don't let the stress get the best of me
Trying to focus on the road that's ahead of me
Till my brain gets cloudy bout a memory

God knows, how I feel now
On the outside I'm smiling, but inside a nigga know he hell bound
It's a dark road, and I'm right here in the middle of it
Do I walk slow or if I run, am I'm missing some'ing
I took the time out, to save a little bread
Now my eyes, got water in em
Why the fuck am I still standing here, nobody love me I ain't happy here
My mama said, she can't handle him
But still, I'm looking at the bright side
But I view it through my other eye, cause it's a different color sky
Then the last one, my mind set on the prize that may never come
So do I try to stay alive, or do I grab a gun
End it all, put a stop to the pain
That goes on in my head, everytime it rains
But that was speaking, so you listening to the thoughts
Of an evil spirit, in demonic verses everytime I talk
I'm confused, by my psychological set backs
In the storm, washin out through the wet cracks
Looking for heaven, off in all the wrong places
I've given up so why the long faces? Let it rain

Your bills keep adding up, to be alone you prefer
Bill collectors steady calling, starting to get on your nerves
Your rent due on the first, but right now it's the third
Telling yourself it's gon get better, but ain't believing a word
Feel like it's hard to deal, tomorrow it's hard as steel
Not to mention the realest member, of your family is getting ill
Tell me it isn't so, tell me it isn't real
In the mist of all the drama, you take a lil' time to kneel
To deal you take a pill, just to deal with the drama
You thinking your life sinking, and there isn't a plumber
They tell you what doesn't kill you, only makes you stronger
You'd have to be a Superman, to live as much as me partna
you're trying, but help is just what you dialing
Cause the room is a monsoon, that's never gon get to drying
The storm is moving on, and you thinking these people lying
They saying they had it worse, but how come they all keep on smiling

Don't let stress take control, gonna be alright I know
I'm a make it through fa sho, fa sho yeah - 2x

My memory, heeeey-heeey yeah
Stressing me-stressing me, my memories
That's what they telling me
I'm trying to focus on the road that's ahead of me
By my memories, yeah hey yeah

On the other hand, boy, you shine
And I can feel after every line
A thrill divine down my spine.

Might think that your song is bad,
But for a person who's just rehearsin'

You're the purple light of a summer night in Spain,
You're the National Gall'ry, You're Garbo's sal'ry,
You're cellophane.

A lucky star's above but not for me
With love to lead the way I've found more clouds of gray

Although I can't dismiss the memory of his kiss

And people declare ""You're through!"",

When at first your kiss I decline.
On the light in your eyes when I surrender,

To prove that even wise men can be wrong,

No matter what all your money buys

Now the light shines through this bottle....memories all fade to black

You had your reasons, God only knows

Hal Ketchum,"I said 'goodnight' to the crowd
Found my way back from another night out in the blue
The sad ones remind me too much of myself
The sweet ones remind me of you

I'd sure like to call 'cause it's lonely out here
But a man hates to say he was wrong
So I'll pull this old guitar up close to my chest
And sing for another day gone

Another day gone, further and further
Away from the arms of the sweetest love I've ever known
I wonder how long the pride of a man can hold on

Facing the dawn, faster and faster the night slips away
And the road it just rolls on and on, sleeping alone
Waking up to another sad song of another day gone

When I walked away
How could I have known, how far we'd drift apart?
Now the time and the distance I thought would save us
Has stolen my place in your heart

And now you don't need me the way I need you
You found your own way to move on
And the star I've been chasing just fades in the night
At the end of another day gone

Another day gone, further and further
Away from the arms of the sweetest love I've ever known
I wonder how long the pride of a man can hold on

Facing the dawn, faster and faster the night slips away
And the road it just rolls on and on, sleeping alone
Waking up to another sad song of another day gone

I got blisters on my fingers, salt stains on my shirt
Close the gate behind me, hear you call my name

I hear you in the kitchen singing like a bird
It's more than just I love you, baby, it's every little word

Talking to flowers, laughing with the kids
Cussing, crying, whisperin'
The sweetest song I have ever heard
It's more than just I love you, baby, it's every little word

Hal Ketchum,"I met her at the mission
Living just this side of sin
Her mouth was soft and when she spoke
Lord, I fell right in

She had a baby in a blanket
A dollar and a half
She looked a little leery
She let out a little laugh

Opened up my overcoat
Invited them inside
Two fragile little flowers
With nowhere left to hide

She said her old man left her
Just before the baby came
I could feel the tears well up inside
Each time she spoke his name

Swing low, swing low
Sweet angel face
Why would such a simple child
Come to such a place?

We talked until the wind died down
Baby woke and stirred
She made a little hushing sound
Spoke some magic word

The baby yawned and smiled at me
But she said, ""We can't stay""
She thanked me for my kindness
Turned and walked away

Swing low, swing low
Sweet angel face
Why would such a simple child
Come to such a place?

I think about them all the time
Hope they found their home
Seems that it's my calling now
To walk these streets alone

Sometimes when the wind is right
I can smell her sweet perfume
I think about the warm embrace
That ended all too soon

Troubles, he had some, but he was not forgotten

Hal Linden,"The day is my enemy, the night my friend
For I'm always so alone till the day draws to an end
But when the sun goes down and the moon comes through
To the monotone of the evening's drone I'm all alone with you

All through the night
I delight in your love
All through the night you're so close to me
All through the night
From a height far above
You and your love brings me ecstasy

When dawn comes to waken me
You're never there at all
I know you've forsaken me
Till the shadows fall
But then once again I can dream, I've the right
To be close to you all through the night",All Through the Night,1962

If you're ever in a jam, here I am
If you're ever in a mess, S.O.S.
If you ever feel so happy, you land in jail
I'm your bail

That's friendship, friendship
Just a perfect blendship
When other friendships have been forgot
Ours will still be hot

And if you're ever up a tree phone to me
If you're ever down a well, ring my bell
If you ever lose your teeth and you're out to dine
Bury mine

That's friendship, friendship
Just a perfect blendship
When other friendships go up in smoke
Ours will still be oak

If they ever black your eyes, put me wise
If they ever cook your goose, turn me loose
If they ever put a bullet through your brain
We'll complain

That's friendship, friendship
Just a perfect blendship
When other friendships have been forget
Ours will still be it

Remember a man's best friend is his
Man's best friend is his
Man's best friend is his friend

Hal Linden,"At words poetic, I'm so pathetic 
That I always have found it best, 
Instead of getting 'em off my chest, 
To let 'em rest unexpressed, 
I hate parading my serenading 
As I'll probably miss a bar, 
But if this ditty is not so pretty 
At least it'll tell you 
How great you are. 

You're the top! 
You're the Coliseum. 
You're the top! 
You're the Louver Museum. 
You're a melody from a symphony by Strauss 
You're a Bendel bonnet, 
A Shakespeare's sonnet, 
You're Mickey Mouse. 
You're the Nile, 
You're the Tower of Pisa, 
You're the smile on the Mona Lisa 
I'm a worthless check, a total wreck, a flop, 
But if, baby, I'm the bottom you're the top! 

Your words poetic are not pathetic. 
On the other hand, babe, you shine, 
And I can feel after every line 
A thrill divine 
Down my spine. 
Now gifted humans like Vincent Youmans 
Might think that your song is bad, 
But I got a notion 
I'll second the motion 
And this is what I'm going to add; 

You're the top! 
You're Mahatma Gandhi. 
You're the top! 
You're Napoleon Brandy. 
You're the purple light 
Of a summer night in Spain, 
You're the National Gallery 
You're Garbo's salary, 
You're cellophane. 
You're sublime, 
You're turkey dinner, 
You're the time, the time of a Derby winner 
I'm a toy balloon that's fated soon to pop 
But if, baby, I'm the bottom, 
You're the top! 

You're the top! 
You're an arrow collar 
You're the top! 
You're a Coolidge dollar, 
You're the nimble tread 
Of the feet of Fred Astaire, 
You're an O'Neill drama, 

You're Whistler's mama! 

You're camembert. 

You're a rose, 
You're Inferno's Dante, 

You're the nose 
On the great Durante. 
I'm just in a way, 
As the French would say, ""de trop"". 
But if, baby, I'm the bottom, 
You're the top! 

You're the top! 
You're a dance in Bali. 
You're the top! 
You're a hot tamale. 
You're an angel, you, 
Simply too, too, too diveen, 
You're a Boticcelli, 
You're Keats, 
You're Shelly! 

You're Ovaltine! 
You're a boom, 
You're the dam at Boulder, 
You're the moon, 
Over Mae West's shoulder, 
I'm the nominee of the G.O.P. 

Or GOP! 

But if, baby, I'm the bottom, 
You're the top! 

You're the top! 
You're a Waldorf salad. 
You're the top! 
You're a Berlin ballad. 
You're the boats that glide 
On the sleepy Zuider Zee, 
You're an old Dutch master, 

You're Lady Astor, 
You're broccoli! 
You're romance, 
You're the steppes of Russia, 
You're the pants, on a Roxy usher, 
I'm a broken doll, a fol-de-rol, a blop, 

But if, baby, I'm the bottom, 
You're the top!",You're the Top [From Anything Goes],1996

Hal McKusick,"As a tot, when I trotted in little velvet panties,
I was kissed by my sisters, my cousins, and my aunties.
Sad to tell, it was hell, an inferno worse than Dante's.

So my dear I swore,
""Never, never more !""
On my list, I insisted that kissing must be crossed out.
Now, I find I was blind, and oh my! How I lost out!

I could cry salty tears,
Where have I been all these years?
Little wow, tell me now:
How long has this been going on?

There were chills up my spine,
And some thrills I can't define.
Listen, sweet, I repeat:
How long has this been going on?

Oh, I feel that I could melt,
Into Heaven I'm hurled!
I know how Columbus felt,
Finding another world.

Kiss me once, then once more.
What a dunce I was before.
What a break! For Heaven's sake!
How long has this been going on?

Dear, when in your arms I creep,
That divine rendezvous,
Don't wake me, if I'm asleep,
Let me dream that it's true!

Kiss me twice, then once more.
That makes thrice, let's make it four!
What a break! For Heaven's sake!

Until you've kissed and had to pay the cost,
Until you've flipped your heart and you have lost,

At the thought of reminiscing,
And how lips that taste of tears
Lose their taste for kissing?

Oh, who'd have thought that I'd walk in a daze
Now I never go to shows at night but just to matinees 
Now I see the show and home I go

Once I laughed when I heard you saying
That I'd be playing solitaire
Uneasy in my easy chair
It never entered my mind
Once you told me I was mistaken
That I'd awaken with the sun
And order orange juice for one
It never entered my mind

You have what I laughed myself
And now I even have to scratch my back myself

Once you warned me that if you scorned me
I'd sing the maiden's prayer again
And wish that you were there again
To get into my hair again

I'm wild again, beguiled again
A simpering, whimpering child again

Couldn't sleep and wouldn't sleep

Bewitched, bothered and bewildered am I

He is cold I agree
He can laugh, but I love it

I'll sing to him, each spring to him
And long for the day when I'll cling to him
Bewitched, bothered, and bewildered am I

Hal Sherfey,"I can recall the sound of the wind
As it blew through the trees and the trees would bend
I can recall the smell of the rain
On a hot summer night
Coming through the screen

I'd crawl in your bed when the lightning flashed
And I'd still be there when the storm had passed
Dead to the world, to the morning cast
Its light all around your room

We lived on a street where the tall elm shade
Was as green as the grass and as cool as a blade
That you held in your teeth as we lay on our backs
Staring up at the blue and the blue stared back

I used to believe we were just like those trees
We'd grown just as tall and as proud as we pleased
With our feet on the ground and our arms in the breeze
Under a sheltering sky

Twirl me about, and twirl me around
Let me grow dizzy and fall to the ground
And when I look up at you looking down,
Say it was only a dream

A big truck was parked in the drive one day
They wrapped us in paper and moved us away
Your room was no longer next door to mine
And this kid sister thing was old by that time

But oh how our dreams went bump in the night
And the voices downstairs getting into a fight
And the next day a silence you could cut with a knife
And feel like a blade at your throat

Twirl me about and twirl me around
Let me grow dizzy and fall to the ground
When I look up at you looking down
Say it as only a dream

The day you left home you got an early start
I watched your car back out in the dark
I opened the door to your room down the hall
I turned on the light
And all that I saw
Was a bed and a desk and couple of tacks
No sign of someone who expects to be back
It must have been one hell of a suitcase you packed

Twirl me about, twirl me around
Let me grow dizzy and fall to the ground
When I look up at you looking down
Say it was only a dream

Hey, you told me that you love me, woman, you meant it

Beware my foolish heart
How white the ever constant moon
Take care my foolish heart

There's a line between love and fascination
That's hard to see, how many names such as this
For they both have the very same sensation
When you're locked in the magic of a kiss

Her lips are much too close to mine
Beware my foolish heart
But should our eager lips combine
Then let the fire start

Or a dream that will fade and fall apart

Nothing can come between us, 
When it gets dark I tow your heart away. 

Standing by a parking meter, 
When I caught a glimpse of Rita, 
Filling in a ticket in her little white book. 
In a cap she looked much older, 
And the bag across her shoulder 
Made her look a little like a military man.
 
Lovely Rita meter maid, 
May I inquire discreetly, 
When are you free to take some tea with me. 
Took her out and tried to win her, 
Had a laugh and over dinner, 
Told her I would really like to see her again

Got the bill and Rita paid it, 
Took her home I nearly made it, 
Sitting on the sofa with a sister or two.

I miss the misery

Leaves me a mess
I miss the feeling of pains in my chest

I miss the late nights
Don't miss you at all
I like the kick in the face
And the things you do to me
I love the way that it hurts

You said that you would marry me
But even if we never do
I will alway be with you, I know

That nothing will ever be
Like when we were twenty-three
Maps will rearrange
And blue will turn to grey
Everything will change
But we will still remain
And outlast the pyramids

I will feel you
I will see you
I will hear you
After the silence
Silence

The oceans can burn for all I care
And in the ashes I'll meet you there
I know someday
The moon will blow away
And all flesh will decay
Everything will change
But we will still remain
And outlast the pyramids

I will feel you
I will see you
I will hear you
And I will keep you

To be on my own

When all have gone away

The time that I prayed

I've been sleeping with a cloud above my bed
I've been lonely for so long
Trapped in the past, I just can't seem to move on

I've been hiding all my hopes and dreams away
Just in case I ever need em again someday
I've been setting aside time
To clear a little space in the corners of my mind

All I want to do is find a way back into love
I can't make it through without a way back into love
Oh oh oh

I've been watching but the stars refuse to shine
I've been searching but I just don't see the signs
I know that it's out there
There's got to be something for my soul somewhere

I've been looking for someone to shed some light
Not somebody just to get me through the night

I could use some direction
And I'm open to your suggestions

All I want to do is find a way back into love
I can't make it through without a way back into love
And if I open my heart again
I guess I'm hoping you'll be there for me in the end
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

There are moments when I don't know if it's real
Or if anybody feels the way I feel
I need inspiration
Not just another negotiation

I can't make it through without a way back into love

I made a due,

Don't tell me about the finer things in life

So help me down you've got it wrong, I don't belong there.

I'm only human, and that's my saving grace,
I fall as hard as I try
So don't be blinded
See me as I really am, I have flaws and sometimes I even sin,
so pull me from that pedestal,
I don't belong there.

And the riddles in the pages leave at too much to guess
And the worry cracks a fracture from your hip to your chest

Missed the beaches from nirvana and the way that they look
And the crooks they’re on the island they’re killin’ to keep runnin'

You won't be perfect
You won't be pure
And Monday asking you
Why did you, how could you play me for the fool

Oh, there's no simple answer
Oh, there's no reason at all

Must have been a beautiful daydream
You didn't come home till three
Must've been a hell of a joyride
You didn't once think of me
Must have been a lot of people
Saying you took more then you gave
But what do you take to take the pain away

I turned to find the truth
The closer I got the farther I got from you
Cause I burned myself on you
How could you, why did you play me for a fool

Oh, there's no simple answer
Hey there's no reason at all

Must have been a beautiful daydream
You didn't come home till three
Must've been a hell of a joyride
You didn't once think of me
Must have been a lot of people
Saying you took more then you gave
But what do you take to take the pain away
And what do you take to make it all go away

You tore every stich
You bait and you switch
You told me you'd change
You'd change everything
Everything

Come chase away the blues 
Of the gloom of my room

Oh, there's no simple answer
Oh, there's no reason at all
And I know I got no simple answer
Hey, I'm not blaming you all

Must have been a beautiful daydream
You didn't come home till three
Must've been a hell of a joyride
You didn't once think of me
Must have been a lot of people
Saying you took more then you gave
But what do you take to take the pain away
And what do you take to make it all go away
And what do you take to take the pain away
And what do you take to make it all go away

I've heard your having the time of your life
Wish you were here
Having it with me tonight
Everything would be alright
Come on, come on help me make it through the time
Oh, the time of your life",Sunday Afternoon,2003
Half Shy,"Hop on back and keep it quiet we’re fighting the night,
Just until we get out of sight, keep low and watch out for lights.
Cold wet grass it keeps us fast we’re running in time, 
Tinder hills and wind in our eyes, we’re lost in warm summer nights.

Come break out before the fight starts,
Come break out of who you think you are,
We’re gonna play it by heart.
Come break out I’m in the front yard,
Break out of who you wish you were,
We’re gonna play it by heart.

Hop the fence but keep it quiet we’re fighting the night,
Small cuts and bruises don’t mind, old marks from where the blood dried. 
We drown our laughs in the planes that pass we’ve worn a straight line
That leads from your house to mine, we’re lost in warm summer nights.

Come break out before the fight starts,
Come break out of who you think you are,
We’re gonna play it by heart.
Come break out I’m in the front yard,
Break out of who you wish you were,
We’re gonna play it by heart.

Real love, blood ties, I was never yours you were never mine.
Tongue tied, four eyes, never got along with the other guys.
Bonfire, switch knives, ready for the cold ready for the fight.
Hard luck, hard lives, we were never told it would be alright. 

Come break out before the fight starts,

Maybe you’re my whole life
Maybe we’re the fantasy
Maybe I’m a low life
Maybe you’re my jealousy 
Maybe you’re my home life
Maybe you're my honesty
Maybe if I’m always right, 
Maybe then you’ll never leave

I ran her down in the street last night, I’ll have my peace and quiet
Maybe love just takes a certain kind, I’ll be here all night.

And the club spillin down, bouncin
We be gettin it on, that's that shit, keep puttin it on
I'm a hoodlum and a don, smoke mad marijuan'
Where you from nigga? Brook-lan, damn right, hoodlum
Raised in the heights, grenades the ice
Faked it twice, laid ya wife, spray AK's in the heist
Laid for 8 days, not to change the ways
Pull a record out, blaze the waves, blaze the A's
Make it bounce, told them not to brake your legs
Brake the stage, make ya day
If you layin up, when we gon' make some way
Make someday, shit, we ain't came to play
Came to stay, comin wit that ill shit
Take it away, bouncin, what we makin 'em say

Ridin down the block wit a Half A Mill
Tented windows in the Benz, all smokin to kill
We gon' bounce to this, roll a L to this
Put the 5 to the Indo, clown to this
Why go? Gonna let you wit the diamond face
Sippin hennecy bottle, wit the speed to chase
Poppin a collar to this, and thugs holla to this
Throw you rolly in the air, nigga hotter than this
We pullin shorties, up the front of the steps
Takin 'em off to back relax, with Crystal and yak
It don't stop till we hittin the last
Torn sack, gettin stress, never get in Cadillac's
Get in, where you fit in
If it don't fit squeeze, outta make up the cheese
Like drop six-o, hydraulical g's
Junk play in the airport, bouncin keys
Gon bounce from back, and side to side
If you in the club, in the car, doin tonight
Gotta limo good and goin up and down to this
Me & baby 'bout try to make it bounce to this
2 o'clock in the morning, put a pound to this
Too many fish, smokin up an ounce to this
You ain't gotta be in my show to be a star
'cause I'm a thug world, no matter who you are
Take her to bathroom, bounce again
Call up homies, you can call your friends
Everybody on the dance floor get wit this
Me and my nigga Half A Mill, comin sick wit this
It don't stop, livin in the world supreme
All the raps, nothin but a hustle to gleam
Baby come and go in this lick wit me
We can be like Mickey and now Minnie

Chicks call me up and say ooh we done heard
You stopped poppin' Cristal nigga, now you sippin' Louie The Third
Moved to Jers, now it's like you moved from Earth
Shoes and furs
You know how much these jewels is worth?
I'm playin' hardball, you usin' a nerf
Haul the Porsche to the Golf course
My Daddy's a mob boss
My Daddy fell off course
But I'm still well off in the loft
Ill fella, Ladies faint during intercourse
Control a bitch' mind like I invented whores
Mack without a Goldie hat or a Six-Four
I got cash and plan to get more
Of that cream chicks strip for, lick dick for 
Hopin' they can get rich for
Up in the Benz door openin' up the Six door
I had you more open than that when I entered your pores
Had your Tits stiff plus made you strip to your drawers
I don't stop 'till I get it get it and get it some more.

Loving you is easy 'cause you're beautiful
You brighten up my day and I never want to see you go away

Milion`
For the streets we burn Phillies on
To the same streets we turned Willie on
Catch me spillin' Dom
I was a Don before Beneton
I been on since they wrote the Kuran
Three-Sixty waves with the spin on
Quarter-bills with the brim on
Try to slaughter Mils 
I have no choice but to draw the steel
I'm hard, somethin' that every broad 'll feel
Like a climax, this rod 'll get all the way to your back 
I'll have your Wifey fightin' you back
Light on the gat
Send my Son to pick her up, she jumps right in the Ac'
She chose me, you know B., why even ask?
Now have a nice day, 'cause it might be your last
Stay cool like ice in a glass
I made these rules, you might could use a class
Tune in to the Mack
Let me introduce you to the facts on shoes and hats
Jewels and stacks
The rules are flat
I was through with that before you knew what to do with that.

Niggas always love me
I get my dick soaked in bubbly
So lovely I got your chick tellin' you ""Nigga, don't touch me""
She don't smoke but she roll dutchies
She was a nice girl now she exposed the hole in her butt-cheeks
Ride the pole 'till the nut leaks
I taught her how to swallow my soul and spit up somethin' sweet
And you wonder why she got your jeep
I turned her out in these streets
Now she's ballin' with freaks
Went from Menage's to Tri-Quadre's, ill ho 
Still feel Mill though
Trips on for real yo
I'm the reason why she threw away her dildo
Flew Ki's over Frisco
It glow, baguettes glisten like the crystal in a disco
You a rich ho, on my dick though
Bought a nigga that Six-O
Ten AV's
Cockin' ya Fifth when your bitch page me
Breakin' your Cellular
She said ""Nigga I'm tellin' ya
I'd die for the Hell of ya, roll lye in the L for ya
Tell lies in Philadelphia
Use my Chocha to get bail for ya"".

It ain't right, if it ain't rough, gettin paid's a must
We made the bucks, even the player's hate us
Is it the way we shine Gordiere gear since '89
And shorty wit diamonds from South African mines
Now it's '99, nearly 2 G, still in coogie
Crib wit Jacuzzi, it is in the movie
I take a shit, grippin the uzi
Plan to make ya rich, smoothly, on the low
Fuck a new V, on the run like cool G.
Marijuana twist, camouflage sis
On some hard shit, charge like a platinum card, kid
Enter the wild life, Crystal life, I'd rather die twice
Before I eat, four chicken wings and fried rice
Yo dunn, we high price, we news of the world
White wine type, I don't like swine type
No bullshit we, strictly chronic to life
Bionic wit mics, seein shit with astronomical sight, tropin night
Laid up, after the fight, live from cocktail Milion
Land like alien, in Roswell
Fly as hell, mad clientele, light up a L
Hot enough to cause fires in hell

[Chorus]
Fire (fire), burnin (burnin)
It's like fire (fire), burnin (burnin)
It's like fire (fire), burnin (burnin)

Stupid reefer, still ride Gucci sneakers
Ill, your shit can kill for the phone, if I leave her
I ain't a player, I just get buffed a lot
Somethin hot must of dropped, headed up top
On the lee-lo, we know, niggas don't want us to see dough
See us flossin, you swear to God we rob Tito's
Car paid for, smack the shit outta the repo
Every verse is kilo, in the streets yo
Thoroughbred exquisite, escalate mega digits
Head twisted, on the red, by vet bitches
Super fly son, movin my gun, born on the run
More to come, all in one, luxurious fallen on
Notorious baller, dunn, peep the prognosis
I be the high explosive, burnin bushes like Howard Moses
Higher dosage, chocolate roasted
Made ya team, without a coach kid, chrome toasted

[Chorus]

[Half-A-Mill]
Project general, wise criminal
Five percent of two, biochemical, nine emeralds
Rubies, sapphire, who be the most higher?
Insult liars, don't try us, get your coke tied up
Throat tied up, we lay til the coke dry up
Race like relays, day and night in V.A.
You want a key and yay, see a
You ain't got the dough we spray, fuck the D.A.
Truck breeze away, material world
Big guns, wit scratched serial world
My cats put an end to your world
Twistin ya girl, hot spittin, pissin ya girl
But she's the freak at night, back seat of the jeep type
Holdin heat type, New World Order of the catamites
War over water, Babylon Six, we the light
We the life givin forces, in this fortress
Of hidden forces, design to trick and torture

Half-A-Mill,"Verse 1:
I used to watch you in the schoolyard while you jump rope
baretts in your hair, fresh gear, your Brothers pump dope
I approached you but no others could come close, I used to buy you
slices of Pizza and Strawberry iceys
gentleman style, always talkin' very nicely
everytime we played House I'd be the Husband you the Wifey
Mom dukes whoopin' your ass because you liked me
walkin' down the block switchin' ya ass tryin' to excite me 
I still have those letters that you used to write me
about how since we met up you see the future brightly
young love, smooth and politely
untouched 
my one touch had you sprung up 
on the phone for hours
I told you before we hung up, ""Young stuff, this World is ours"" 
together Girl we can make a better World
my ghetto Girl....

Chorus - 
You're my ghetto girl in a ghetto World 
for you I'd dead the World
I'll never forget my ghetto girl
you're a ghetto girl in a ghetto World
gave me a better World
I'll never forget my ghetto girl 
you're a ghetto girl in a ghetto World
for you I'd dead the World
I'll never forget my ghetto girl 

Verse 2:
I still spend days reminiscin' 
age changed, different livin' 
cables and chains, waves spinnin' 
had you in the projects, the Gods knowledged you as my Wisdom 
always around tryin' to lock me down like Prison
I saw your vision 
always wishin' for the day we'd have kids'n
wedding and a Cristening 
baguettes around your wrist'n 
chicks used to say to you always ""Why you stick with him?""
""Every conversation we have you always mention him""
in all actuality they just mad 'cause I ain't get with them 
and all the Men they ever had seemed to split on them 
but I ain't gonna do you like those Cats did to them 
hustlin' cracks, bustin' the MAC so nice clothes can cover your back
you lovin' me and I'm lovin' you back 
rubbin' your back
can't nobody tell you other than that.

Chorus - 

Verse 3: 
Out of this World
no more Guess, you're a Gibana girl
givin' me Sex, you were a ""I guess I'll try it"" girl
still into baguettes, Tennis set type of World
Black Queen Nefertiti in the flesh in my World
in the best of my World
you're obsessed with my World
I'd tell you how much I was blessed since you stepped in my World
I loved to caress you and express to you 
I only want what's best for you 
sexin' you in unforgettable ways, I treasure you
pleasure you to an extent that's imeasureable
it's terrible, with every intent to put the spell on you
share with you
in Eight-Fifty-I's you see a clearer view
here boo, this Six is for you
I want you to live it too.

Toke calico, deep throat the baddest hoes
Niggas know my status quote, artistic
I draw a biscuit, unlike Michaelangelo, I'm the Noah of this thug shit
Flooded, everyday's another bucket get
I can't front, I love this shit
You missed the lies, now we push S5's on some other shit
Blowin another clip, some say they waitin for the mothership
I ain't debatin, 'cause in heaven or hell, I tell God, I tell Satan
I'm all about money makin, on my job like a hundred Jamaicans
Runnin wit kingpins, who you gon rob
I send a squad to kill ya squad
Fuck ya thinkin, Firm niggas push Cadillac Jeeps,
Navigator Lincoln's
Global caught on my Motorola Mobile
Off the hook books like Barnes & Nobles
Street astroligist, heat communist, complete logic is
I got one goal, to put goal on the streets, where the projects is
We too strong to die, that's why we gotta live
Platinum doubt in the hottest whips

I used to sling crills for loot
Now I'm openin my money store like Phil Rezoot
Keep it here, dope from get money whores
Thought he enter the drawers

Awesome broads they carry proem and sawed-off
One shot'll take the whole top of your Honda Accord off
You small dog, you all lost
No wins, you fall off, and get hauled off in the trunk of my Benz
I smoke skunk, purple haze, twist it up
Mixed it up, hit the clutch, switched it up

[Half-A-Mill]
I smoke purple haze and spit phlegm
Big Benz, forty inch rims, New York niggas got shit locked again
When the glocks pop, niggas need oxygen
Don't let me catch you slingin rocks on these blocks again
I got plots, I'm out to get a hundred thou time ten
You know my style dunn, I run with foul wild men
With public housin, up north, we be thuggin in the mountain
Out in the world, we guzzle Henny straight and no earl
Hustle weight, stab a half a cake on your girl, skatin through states
Jets raidin the place, TV's screen big, DVD playin Scarface
Son, I'm God face, hard face
Smash you in the chest wit a sledgehammer till ya heart break
Wild out, my calico pop rounds out, my shots knock towns out
My whole block'll run up in your town house
I'm like so shocked, key the coke like Sosa
Pushin ski boat wit a chauffeur
Up the Hudson River, I got tons of guns and ones are split up

Even your name. 
You didn't forget that you came to Manage the campaign.

Halford,"From memories of 68 when the wizard shook the world
Metal came from foundries where the midlands sound unfurled
The bullring was a lonely place of concrete towers and steel
The coal mines and the industries were all I had to fell.

Something inside took hold of me, I really didn't know
But overtime it came to be, I knew which way to go
I drove around in search of what would make this all come true
From jazz and electricity and good old southern blues

Hell, we're born to raise some hell
Hell, we're gonna raise some hell

In Henry's and in mother's where I'd go to bang my head
The feeling took a hold of me with every word I said
The voice was born and came alive from all I saw and heard
And now I knew my destiny, I had to spread the word.

I took the scream around the world
From London to L.A.
Unleashed in downtown Tokyo
Blew Godzilla away

Then on the sound and fury went from Sydney to Brazil
It sent the Russians crazy cause they never get their fill.

Of Hell, we're born to raise some hell
Hell, we're gonna raise some hell
Hell, we're born to raise some hell
Hell, we're gonna raise some hell

The stage and the lights and the amps are ablaze watch them burn
From all this insanity the Metal God's will return.

Shock waves attack relentlessly, intimidating force
So many bands surrounding you with evil from our source
It screams across the universe and slams you to the floor
This blitzkrieg psycho mania is coming on full roar
The world's a stage that's waiting for its bad ass to get kicked
And we're all on the road to hell and that's route 666

You spineless things that belly down to slither
To the end of the world you follow to be near

Mourn for us oppressed in fear
Chained and shackled we are bound
Freedom choked in dread we live

Withdraw your feeble aches and moans
Or suffer smite from this my hand

My legions faithful unto death

And as you perish each of you shall scream as you are sought

Parasites that hide
Detonate the human bomb
Hands are all awash in blood

Carnage from the scriptures
Slaughter of the lamb
Break the neck of the white dove
Run down by the tracks above

Whip the back of your messiah
Your peace kills by death
Bow your head, the prayer calls to violence
That history rejects

Waiting wall of murder
Consummating hate
League of perpetuity
Will open wounds of disbelief

Through self immolation
You desecrate the ground
Annihilate the innocents
In crucifixion crashing down

Whip the back of your messiah
Your peace kills by death
Bow your head, the prayer calls to violence
That history rejects

Eyes are spitting venom
Shocked senseless by the grief
Another day for dying
As your terror cry abominates

Mushroom cloud is coming
Hanging by the nails
Gasoline the olive branch
Start digging up more body pits

Whip the back of your messiah
Your peace kills by death
Bow your head, the prayer calls to violence
That history rejects

Your peace kills by death

Crystallized in paranoia
Lost yourself inside her madness
Beast has glazed your being
With it's torture

And all the faults in your life
The suffering can't be mine
The curse will grow with what you prey for

And still she comes

She's callin'

Halford,"From memories of '68 when The Wizard shook the world,
Metal came from foundries where the midlands sound unfurled.
The Bull Ring was a lonely place of concrete towers and steel,
The coal mines and the industries were all I had to feel.
Something inside took hold of me, I really didn't know,
But over time it came to be, I knew which way to go.
I drove around in search of what would make this all come true,
Some jazz and electricity and good old southern blues

Hell, we're born to raise some hell.
Hell, we're gonna raise some hell.

In Henry's and in Mother's where I'd go to bang my head
The feeling took a hold of me with every word I said.
The voice was born and came alive from all I saw and heard
And now I knew my destiny, I had to spread the word.
I took the scream around the world from London to L.A.
Unleashed in downtown Tokyo, blew Godzilla away.
Then on the sound and fury went from Sydney to Brazil
It sent the Russians crazy 'cause they never get their fill.

Of Hell, we're born to raise some hell,
Hell, we're gonna raise some hell.
Hell, we're born to raise some hell,
Hell, we're gonna raise some hell.

The stage and the lights and the amps are ablaze, watch them burn.
From all this insanity the Metal Gods will return.

So many bands surrounding you with evil from our source
It screams across the universe and slams you to the floor
This blitzkrieg psycho-mania is coming on full roar
The world's a stage that's waiting for its bad ass to get kicked
And we're all on the road to Hell and that's route 666

He was about to end it all when some thing changed his life

And in a feat of danger with his jacket as a cape
He stared into the eyes of death and bought it to his knees

I've had the devil on my back for twenty five years

For when you fall
You have to reach the bottom
And count your blessings
That you're still alive

That's when you look
To someone who was with you
At every single step
Right by your side

It's said from this you grow
Inside much stronger
That may be true
But I am still so weak

There's days that seem
So endless makes me wonder
Will something come
To close this losing streak

[Chorus]

I'm tired and so lonely
From this journey
And still can't figure out
Some things I've said

But all I know
Is there's a place that's calling
I'll find that place
And rest my weary head

Twenty-five years
Twenty-five years
I tried to be a man
And face my fears

Twenty-five years
Twenty-five years
I've had the devil on my back
For twenty five years",Twenty-Five Years,2010
Halford,"He's king of the world
On top of his game
He only holds back
To take perfect aim

He turns days to nights
With all that he has
A signature blow
Turns jaws into glass

Opponents line up as they meet him
And watch as they fall one by one
The title is held by the leader
He gets there by shock and by stun

Ready to fight and to make it all right
He's the undisputed heavyweight champion of the world
Taking the prize to dismiss and demise
He's the undisputed heavyweight champion of the world
The undisputed heavyweight champion of the world

So easy to judge
The temper that boils
He'll take the mistakes
To the victor the spoils

Pugnacious and firm
Combative by rule
The charm's in his fist
So pity the fool

Don't step in the ring, or it's owner
Enables that justice prevails
It's hard to give in and then own up
No limits when you're hard as nails

Bring it all on and do what must be done
He's the undisputed heavyweight champion of the world
Give up your hopes you'll be left on the ropes

He's the undisputed heavyweight champion of the world
The undisputed heavyweight champion of the world

A battle of wits
That's made in the mind
With physical force
He's cruel to be kind

The struggle's within
The outcome is plain
The effort pays back
And nothings in vain

Opponents line up as they meet him
And watch as they fall one by one
The title is held by the leader
He gets there by shock and by stun

Time to make peace or to beg for release
He's the undisputed heavyweight champion of the world
Look in the face of the deadly embrace
He's the undisputed heavyweight champion of the world

Halford,"We're not alone, we have a chance you see
Let's live the dreams we have in life
There's nothing left if you can't walk with me
You know we need to put it right

[Chorus]
We own the night
And whatever comes our way
Nothing will hold us back
When we love and we obey

When I'm with you, you give me all your strength
And with your love I carry on
Well we both know it takes the two of us
To face the truth don't need to run

[Chorus]

Let's take tonight
And forget about the day
Stand at the edge of life
Let the starts come out to play

You wait and see
Our light will grow and grow
Open eyes will realize
The ray of life to hold

Our world of calm
It sings right from the heart
Can you hear the storm of fear
Can't tear this love apart

If we don't leap for faith
How can we be free
We can't deny or say goodbye
We found our destiny

Don't leave me alone
I can't stand the thought of being here without you
My heart turns to stone
Look in my eyes, my words are true

[Chorus]

I'm not alone
But ships pass in the night
Hold me now, hold me now
Before my heart takes flight",We Own the Night,2010
Halford,"Well I'll be damned 
Here comes your ghost again 
But that's not unusual 
It's just that the moon is full 
And you happened to call 
And here I sit 
Hand on the telephone 
Hearing a voice I'd known 
A couple of light years ago 
Heading straight for a fall

As I remember your eyes 
Were bluer than robin's eggs 
My poetry was lousy you said 
Where are you calling from? 
A booth in the midwest 
Ten years ago 
I bought you some cufflinks 
You brought me something 
We both know what memories can bring 
They bring diamonds and rust

Well you burst on the scene 
Already a legend 
The unwashed phenomenon 
The original vagabond 
You strayed into my arms 
And there you stayed 
Temporarily lost at sea 
The Madonna was yours for free 
Yes the girl on the half-shell 
Could keep you unharmed

Now I see you standing 
With brown leaves falling all around 
And snow in your hair 
Now you're smiling out the window 
Of that crummy hotel 
Over Washington Square 
Our breath comes out white clouds 
Mingles and hangs in the air 
Speaking strictly for me 
We both could have died then and there

Now you're telling me 
You're not nostalgic 
Then give me another word for it 
You who are so good with words 
And at keeping things vague 
'Cause I need some of that vagueness now 
It's all come back too clearly 
Yes I loved you dearly 
And if you're offering me diamonds and rust 
I've already paid",Diamonds and Rust,2011
Halford,"There I was completely wasted, out of work and down.
All inside it's so frustrating as I drift from town to town.
Feel as though nobody cares if I live or die,
So I might as well begin to put some action in my life
Breaking the law, breaking the law
Breaking the law, breaking the law
Breaking the law, breaking the law
Breaking the law, breaking the law
So much for the golden future:  I can't even start!
I've had every promise broken, there's anger in my heart!
You don't know what it's like, you don't have a clue
If you did you'd find yourselves doing the same thing too

Halford,"We've taken too much for granted
And all the time it had grown
From techno seeds we first planted
Evolved a mind of its own
Marching in the streets
Dragging iron feet
Laser beaming hearts
Ripping men apart
From off I've seen my perfection
Where we could do as we please
In secrecy this infection
Was spreading like a disease
Hiding underground
Knowing we'd be found
Fearing for our lives
Reaped by robot's scythes
Metal Gods
Metal Gods
Metal Gods

Machines are taking all over
With mankind in their command
In time they'd like to discover
How they can make their demand
Better be the slaves
To their wicked ways
But meeting with our death

For anything I ask, I just ask help them, oh Lord

Playing soccer in the glass and using ball made of steel

Ask a starving sickle youth when he's going to get his next meal

Halfway Home,"those nights disappeared like words written in the sand
and we think it makes us better off
and then we laughed about the loss

but there's a thousand miles of pavement between you and I
I'd drive another hour just to get me home tonight
but you don't have the eyes to see
the writing on the wall that says I'm sorry

you can't say a word tonight, the stars have got you hypnotized
spit out all those lies before you choke on them
it's not to late to make amends, when all our lives turn to quicksand

after all frustration, so tired, things don't seem better off

Halfway to Gone,"Written in these walls are the stories that I can't explain
I leave my heart open but it stays right here empty for days

She told me in the morning
She don't feel the same about us in her bones
It seems to me that when I die
These words will be written on my stone

And I'll be gone, gone tonight
The ground beneath my feet is open wide
The way that I've been holdin' on too tight
With nothing in between

The story of my life, I take her home
I drive all night to keep her warm and time
Is frozen (the story of, the story of)
The story of my life, I give her hope
I spend her love until she's broke, inside
The story of my life (the story of, the story of)

Written on these walls are
The colors that I can't change
Leave my heart open
But it stays right here in it's cage

I know that in the morning now
I see us in the light upon a hill
Although I am broken, my heart is untamed, still

And I'll be gone, gone tonight
The fire beneath my feet is burning bright
The way that I've been holdin' on so tight
With nothing in between
