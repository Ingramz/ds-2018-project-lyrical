Friendly Fires,"I see you come out of a strobe
You come out of a strobe
We stop and try to catch some breath
We try to catch some breath

I lost it, I can't remember that
We mean well but it never does

And after all this time
Who would've thought I'd need you here
And after all this time
Who would've thought I'd need you here

I heard you got somebody new
You got somebody new
But what made you think of coming back?
You're coming, coming back

I held you, I can remember that
The walk home, we stood out in the cold

And after all this time
Who would've thought I'd need you here
And after all this time
Who would've thought I'd need you here

And you melt white snow
Before you let me know

And after all this time
Who would've thought I'd need you here

Friendly Fires,"Oh, she was young in her mind
They're the days, they were old and tired
Along came a love
She had yearned for so long, oh, she felt on fire

She'd do anything for him
She'd do anything for him

Oh, he was close as the label in a shirt
Never left her side
Oh, he would lace handkerchief in the rain
If she ever walked by

He'd do anything for her
He'd do anything for her

Hold back and keep slow
All the light's out in your cold heart now
Hold back and keep slow
All the light's out in your cold heart now

Stuck in a world that would pull them apart
And it cost in time
If only they knew up ahead loomed a cloud
That was as black as night

She'd do anything for him
She'd do anything for him

Oh, they were strong
They could take on the world and put up a fight
And even the clouds couldn't stand in the way
When they held on tight

He'd do anything for her
He'd do anything for her

Hold back and keep slow
All the light's out in your cold heart now
Hold back and keep slow
All the light's out in your cold heart now

Don't hold your breath too long
For white diamonds in the snow
Don't hold your breath too long
For white diamonds in the snow

Hold back and keep slow
All the light's out in your cold heart now
Hold back and keep slow
All the light's out in your cold heart now

Friendly Fires,"Rub that line out of the sand
I can see you closer
Closer than you'll ever be
Rub that line above the sand
I know you think it's over
Staring out into the sea

Don't let go, this could be so perfect
Don't let go, if we hold onto it

Rub that line above the sand
Right before the tide comes
Washes you away from me

Oh, kiss of life
Oh, kiss of life

Could you wave goodbye to sun?
The sea, the stars, the waves, the tide?
The wails inside, that life has died.
But all you need is a kiss of life

Rub that line out of the sky
I can feel the night crawl
A broken drum and tambourine
Rub that line out of the sky
I can see the clouds form
Taking shape in front of me

Don't let go, this could be so easy
Don't let go, if you hold on to me

Rub that line out of the sky
Right before the sun falls

Kiss of life

Oh, kiss of life
Oh, kiss of life

There is someone I'm longing to see
Someone I simply can't help but adore
Someone who'll thrill me forever
Some day my prince will come
Some day I'll find my love

When the prince of my dreams comes to me
He'll whisper, I love you,
And steal a kiss or two
Though he's far away,
I'll find my love some day
Some day when my dreams come true
Some day I'll find my love
Someone to call my own

Only for nights in Ballygrand,
I would swim over the deepest ocean,
The deepest ocean to be by your side.

But the sea is wide and I can't swim over
And neither have I wings to fly.
I wish I could find me a handy boatman
To ferry me over to my love and die.

My childhood days bring back sad reflections
Of happy days so long ago.
My boyhood friends and my own relations.
Have all passed on like the melting snow.

So I'll spend my days in endless roving,
Soft is the grass and my bed is free.
Oh to be home now in Carrickfergus,
On the long road down to the salty sea.

And in Kilkenny it is reported
On marble stone there as black as ink,
With gold and silver I did support her
But I'll sing no more now till I get a drink.

Or when the valleys hushed and white with snow

And when you come and all the flowers are dying
If I am dead, as dead I will may be
You'll come and find the place where I am lying
And 'neel and say an 'Ave' for me

And all my grave will warm and sweeter be

Conception state hospital birth
The most threadbare, tall story the country has ever heard
Brought home to breath smoke in the arms of her mother
The blunt kitchen knife, who just lays in a submissive position
Beneath a national weight, and the slow arc of a fist

Her heart beats like a breezeblock, thrown down the stairs
Her blood is thicker than concrete, forced to be brave, she was
Born into a grave

And in the limp through years of bored schooling
She’s accustomed to hearing that she could never run far
A slipped disc in the spine of community
A bloody curse word in a pedestrian verse
Spirits in graveyards and fingers in car parks
She cries on the high street just to be heard.
A screaming anchor for nothing in particular
At the foot of the fuck of it
Dragging her heels in the dirt

Her heart beats like a breezeblock, thrown down the stairs
Her blood is thicker than concrete, forced to be brave, she was
Born into a grave

The cheek of youth flashed red and turned grey
Now she lies on the pavement she is helped to her feet
All thighs, hair and magpie handbags
Saturday’s uniform for the ‘fuck me’ parade
Brought home to keep warm in the arms of a plumber, ruddy and balding
Who just needs a spine to dig in to
A chest for the head and a hand for the holding

Her heart beats like a breezeblock, thrown down the stairs
Her blood is thicker than concrete, forced to be brave, she was
She was

Her heart beats like a breezeblock, thrown down the stairs
Her skin is thicker than concrete, forced to be brave, she was

Wrapped my hand around the glass again
We all thought that I might change as I got older
Fell down and nothing bled
Wrapped in cotton alcohol again
To the hill hear from the prick upon my shoulder
Free pour the fruitless thoughts
It's far too late to talk so much but
Still not giving up though
I wish that I was sober

Forgive me I can't speak straight
Forgive me I can't
Forgive me it's far too late

Choke down the gateway drug
Opened the gates, in came the flood, it comes
Like a blush of love, it hits me without warning
Long nights of getting lost
Iwalk beneath the bridge I don't know
I need black suit for tomorrow, I'm in mourning

My love you should know
The best of me left hours ago so
Shove it right into my mouth and let me smolder
Fallout and the damage done
I can't un-sing the things I've sung
Still not giving up though
I wish that i was sober

Forgive me I can't speak straight

Frightened Rabbit,"I was mothered like an orchid tethered to eternal sights
I hurried home in orbit close to where I know I’m fine
No edge of the seat, no arms ever broken, you see

I waited for the crash to come
Too many days with too little to do
I waited but nothing came at all
So many days spent in empty rooms

The little drum inside behaves itself until you turn twenty-five
And then it strikes this all we've lived this long and only ever half alive

Too many days with too little to do

Frightened Rabbit,"In a commissioned town, on Lump Street
The brick-hard boy repeats a scripted lie
Eyes to the ground on Lump Street
There’s a broken jaw behind the dog-tooth smile

The grunt and moan behind the night here
Though breath is warm, sex is cold
Nothing is grown on Lump Street
Each piece is fired inside a broken mould

Do you want more
Unshapely love?
What you waiting for?
Cut out that lump

She tore his tongue out at the end of Lump Street
She liked to see the blood beneath his skin
He wore her muscles, kissed the bruising
Away
Away

Do you want more
Unshapely love?
What you waiting for?
Cut out that lump

He’s a full-grown man, no shoulder to cry on
Raised by wolves and they taught him to bite down hard
No locks on the doors no corner to hide in
Scars like armour, dead boys eyes

She’s a Lump Street girl, with a blade in her brow
Raised by the state but they tore it all down
They fucked and they fought but it still felt right
Run away from these orange Lump Street lights

I don’t need water I just want to wave goodbye, goodbye

Not for the first time
I woke up hurting
Though I can’t quite say why
I woke up hurting
Woke up hurting

Slug through the day, sneak between
The houses I have made
And run sacred rivers up my sleeve
Pills by mouth with lemonade
As the hours slow down, they all clock out
Of the cracked up daily grind
I’m in a back back street, coming down
I wait for the beam of light
Show me the door
I need somewhere to go

And if I believe the radio the levy is dry
There is sick on the pavement from seven weeks ago
Nothing is sacred, not even our home
Feels like there's a drug dust filling up my nose

I won't be sorry anymore
Since January 1st
When everything got rained on, washed away the dirt
Saw the heavens letting go
In a melancholy burst
Everything got rained on, didn't even hurt

Everything has changed, not for better or for worse
Are they tears or is it rain?
Doesn't matter anymore
In the end they're both the same
We're less filthy than before
Didn't ask for a downpour
Didn't need a flood
Still I think I found the answer somewhere in the mud
All this lying in the sun doesn't fill my cup

Because I was empty

On the wire between carefree
And not caring at all

I'll go wherever I can go, roadless as I am
Roadless soul

I got lost
Just hanging around
In a blur of the days and weeks and months
Took the calendar down
And watched everyone going somewhere

Bathing in bleach
I'm too neutral now to find color o'er my cheeks

Let's go back in a day
I'm talking back in a day
Before I used to MC
When D-Power D he was just a DJ
I was in the jungle vibe
Selling records from 9 to 5
I used to go old school
...
And skip a bus right then
I lost a vibe
Then UKG come alive
I'm talking munchie
Talking...
And then came one two three
And then came Wiley then came Dizzy Kano and D Double E
...
And grime is alive
It was hard but we still survived
I know music evolves through time but
I thank you Lord that grime still alive
And I bust the mic
Now I'm on lord of the mic
Now I've linked on with modestep
2012 is a whole next hype

Alright where do I start
Let me come back let me go from the start
My life without music is a thorn in the heart
This marriage could have end in the park
It's like taking tea from a shop
English way Jamaican herry
The rivals listening to Morgan Harage
UKJ hard ass crew
Beating of the drums
LIstening to ABBA
I knew like when it was like Jacobs
...
Bob Marley, Gwen Steffani James Brunt
For you they may hardly relate
But for me they're all in the same playground
And it all comes together like a rain and cold weather
This is my Darwin Theory
Not like humans and apes
It's more like ...

Then party like a rockstar

I was broke
Everybody loved me
Get paid up

I'm sick understatement
Me and your mate work in a basement
I used to have one pair of nikes
Now I've got countless trainers

Been doing this thing since TDK
Now it's all like top cd Djs
The way that I know that's PBK
Hardless fun I bust your mind

But I still represent the sounds of the UK

And I bust the mic
Now I'm on lord of the mic
Now I've linked on with modestep
2012 is a whole next hype

Alright where do I start
Let me come back let me go from the start
My life without music is a thorn in the heart
This marriage could have end in the park
It's like taking tea from a shop
English way Jamaican herry
The rivals listening to Morgan Harage
UKJ hard ass crew
Beating of the drums
LIstening to ABBA
I knew like when it was like Jacobs
...
Bob Marley, Gwen Steffani James Brunt
For you they may hardly relate
But for me they're all in the same playground
And it all comes together like a rain and cold weather
This is my Darwin Theory
Not like humans and apes
It's more like ...
Then you got dubstep
Then party like a rockstar
A rockstar
Yeah, yeah

For as long as I remember
I've always had music on my agenda
Yes! Number one contender
Yes! Lyrical skunk never heard of my scent
I used to listen to Call Fm!
Black market...
Couple a years later
Lyrical sniper
I was a raver
Me and my man got briefing everywhere
Goin' on horrid
Heartless bears we are so solid
To be a MC ouh it was so funny
After years and determination
I'm part of a world known organization
Undefeated no other teaming
...
And no formation
Me and my mate is a Jesus
I was broke
Everybody loved me
Get paid up
...
I'm sick understatement
Me and your mate work in a basement
I used to have one pair of nikes
Now I've got countless trainers

Been doing this thing since TDK
Now it's all like top cd Djs
The way that I know that's PBK
Hardless fun I bust your mind
That man there was leaving away
...
That's what I was back in the day
But I still represent the sounds of the UK
Little bit of dubstep little bit of grime
...
Be my
Doing this for awesome crew
One for the a track and dynamite boo
I don't wanna tell them what to do
They'll deal with a nasty crew
Park your crew

In the night, though we're apart,
There's a ghost of you within my haunted heart
Ghost of you, my lost romance,
Lips that laugh, eyes that dance

Dreams repeat a sweet but lonely song to me

Our summer day withers away
Too soon, too soon.

Speak low when you speak, love,
Our moment is swift, like ships adrift,
We're swept apart too soon.

Speak low, darling speak low,
Love is a spark lost in the dark,
Too soon, too soon,
I feel wherever I go
That tomorrow is near, tomorrow is here
And always too soon.

Time is so old and love so brief,
Love is pure gold and time a thief.
We're late darling, we're late,
The curtain descends, ev'rything ends

I wait darling, I wait

That to me is what your eyes are,
Soft as stars in April skies are,
Tell me some day you'll fulfill

Flashing eyes in which my hopes rise,
Let me show you where my heart lies.
Let me prove that it adores
That loveliness of yours.

Content to stargaze at the skies.
Now I only want to to melt
The stardust in your eyes.

When if ever, will my lips know
If it's me for whom those eyes glow?
Makes no diff'rence where you are,
Your eyes still hold my wishing star,

Frits Landesbergen,"Once she dressed in silks and lace, Owned a Rolls Royce car
Now she seems quite out of place, like a fallen star
Draped around my kitchen sink , Happy as can be
I just have to stop and think, Why she fell for me.

I'm not much to look at, nothing to see
Just glad I'm livin' and lucky to be
I got a woman crazy for me
She's funny that way.

I can't save a dollar, ain't worth a cent
She doesn't holler she'd live in a tent
I got a woman crazy for me
She's funny that way.

Tho' she loves to work and slave for me ev'ry day
She'd be so much better off if I went away.

But why should I leave her, why should I go
She'd be unhappy without me I know
I got a woman crazy for me
She's funny that way.

She should have the very best, Anyone can see
Still she's diff'rent from the rest, satisfied with me.
While I worry plan and scheme, Over what to do
Can't help feeling it's a dream, Too good to be true. 

Never had nothin'; no one to care
That's why I seem to have more than my share,
I got a woman, crazy for me,
She's funny that way.

When I hurt her feelings, once in a while,
Her only answer is one little smile,
I got a woman crazy for me.
She's funny that way.

I can see no other way and no better plan,
End it all and let her go to some better man;
But I'm only human, coward at best
I'm more than certain she'd follow me west,
I got a woman crazy for me,
She's funny that way.",He Is Funny That Way,2000

A little room where all the roses bloom
I want to lead you into Nature's hall
Where ev'ry year the roses give a ball
They have an orchestra up in the trees
For their musicians are the birds and bees
And they will sing us a song
As we are strolling along
 
In sunny Roseland, where summer breezes are playing
Where the honey bees are ""A-Maying""
There all the roses are swaying
Dancing while the meadow brook flows
The moon when shining is more than ever designing
For 'tis ever then I am pining
Pining to be sweetly reclining
Somewhere in Roseland
Beside a beautiful rose
 
The ball is over and tulips meet
Their little kisses are so short and sweet
The lilies nod to the forget-me-nots
When they're departing in their flower pots
But all the roses with their spirits high
Remain to love until they droop and die
And dear, why shouldn't it be
Just so with you and with me
 
In sunny Roseland, where summer breezes are playing
Where the honey bees are ""A-Maying""
There all the roses are swaying
Dancing while the meadow brook flows

Can't you see I'm no good without you
Take my lips I want to lose them
Take my arms I'll never use them

It turned out to be the luckiest day I've known

Hard to believe that this is real

Or where we went wrong

Maybe less, maybe more

And burn that city to the ground

Ever since you can remember you was fully grown
Slangin' rocks on tha block with a knot in ya sock
Then you might be
Gang related! murder rap
Notches all in your belt
Robbery and sellin'
Trees the only jobs that you held
Been to more damn funerals than the reverend himself

Did your crew's name originate in Illinois?
Do you cross your enemies out with a ""k""

C'est un mot qu'on dirait inventé pour elle
Quand elle danse et qu'elle met son corps à jour
Tel un oiseau qui étend ses ailes pour s'envoler
Alors je sens l'enfer s'ouvrir sous mes pieds

J'ai posé mes yeux sous sa robe de gitane
À quoi me sert encore de prier Notre-Dame
Quel est celui qui lui jettera la première pierre
Celui-là ne mérite pas d'être sur terre

Ô Lucifer!
Ô laisse-moi rien qu'une fois
Glisser mes doigts dans les cheveux d'Esmeralda

Belle
Est-ce le diable qui s'est incarné en elle
Pour détourner mes yeux du Dieu éternel
Qui a mis dans mon être ce désir charnel
Pour m'empêcher de regarder vers le Ciel

Elle porte en elle le péché originel
La désirer fait-il de moi un criminel
Celle qu'on prenait pour une fille de joie une fille de rien
Semble soudain porter la croix du genre humain

Ô Notre-Dame!
Ô laisse-moi rien qu'une fois
Pousser la porte du jardin d'Esmeralda

Belle
Malgré ses grands yeux noirs qui vous ensorcellent
La demoiselle serait-elle encore pucelle
Quand ses mouvements me font voir monts et merveilles
Sous son jupon aux couleurs de l'arc-en-ciel

Ma dulcinée laissez-moi vous être infidèle
Avant de vous avoir menée jusqu'à l'autel
Quel est l'homme qui détournerait son regard d'elle
Sous peine d'être changé en statue de sel

Ô Fleur-de-Lys!
Je ne suis pas homme de foi
J'irai cueillir la fleur d'amour d'Esmeralda

J'ai posé mes yeux sous sa robe de gitane
À quoi me sert encore de prier Notre-Dame
Quel est celui qui lui jettera la première pierre
Celui-là ne mérite pas d'être sur terre

Ô Lucifer!
Ô laisse moi rien qu'une fois
Glisser mes doigts dans les cheveux d'Esmeralda

From Ashes Rise,"


In a free land, we watch our victories,
Killing our annoyances as the troops march away.
We talk of no more, for there's a price to pay.
In a free land, children starve and are beaten to death.
We rape when we feel, and we take no shit.
In decisive calm, mediated for viewing pleasure,
We cherish revenge to the sound of war.
This is not make believe.
This is so fucking real.
Dead mothers still there, dead brothers still there, dead children still there.
Now do you believe?
In a course of annihilation, in a fervor of terror to take control of who we are,
Death by design, a plan of war.
This is not make believe, this is so fucking real.
This is war.






",In a Free Land,2003
From Ashes Rise,"


Next to nightmares, there are no dreams, shattered skulls in splitting seams.
The pounds of cancer, they just can't scream.
Six feet under, who would believe?
Days and night living with death, medicate the symptoms, but let them bleed.
We all live in hells.
We won't believe when the truth of lies is their belief.
We will bring you down the same as those you have taken from me.
Lies and deceit.
No more lies of stolen dreams taken from me.






",Nightmares,2003
From Ashes Rise,"


Listen to the piercing cacophony that falls from your tongue,
To your own beating heart in the bedlam and hum,
To the bellicose turmoil in the breaths of the young.
Listen to the requiem.
Show your face or perish.

Danger wouldn't come from a sky of blue
Choices would be clear

And strangers would be kinder
Love a little blinder
As it saved the day
If I had my way

Every now and then it seems
We live our lives to such extremes
Racing all around, never homeward bound
Losing what we've found

But if I had my way
Things would be different
No one would believe that a lie was true
Choices would be clear

And wisdom would be heeded
Warnings never needed
This is what I'd pray
If I had my way

The milk of human kindness
Would seek us out and find us
And color all the words we say

And hearts would come alive
Instead of breaking
No one would believe that a lie was true
Angels would appear

Children would be cherished
Hope would never parish
Faith would not betray

But I'm still waiting by the phone

I'm mistreated and I'm torn

And if he moves I trip, my fingers itch

I got a vision, I'm on a mission, listen
I can hear 'em, but I can't trust my intuition
I'm wishin' upon that midnight mystical
And through the darkness I'm hopin' for a miracle

I can't holler 'till you hear me
I gotta get me through the madness
Even though I'm guilty
And as I reload I'm all alone, set to explode
Like an unlogical murderer that's in the zone

I know they workin', the spirit's lurkin', I'm hurtin'
The triple six with the kiss got my soul searchin'
Then I woke and I choked on a cloud of smoke

The dark of the night starts to set in
Lots of deals goin' down under the city lights

And the homies still relyin' on the flag
Yeah, life starts to twist and turn
Then they hit you at another angle
Just some more drama in the City of Angels

Fuckin' memories, we cried so many tears
Oh, the devil plays the repo man
And he's suckin' up souls as fast as he can

It's no question, it's in our nature
A .45 brings out the criminal behavior
When the clouds in the sky turn black and gloom
As soon as the smoke starts to fill the room

Your heart starts to beat, it's like a ritual
And the feelin' that you get is somewhat spiritual
I'm a have to let you know how reality go
Learn to fly like The Crow as you slide into limbo

L.A. is sure a crazy ass place to stay
Where the riders ride and the players play
I've been around the world and around the way

Mi casa es su casa
Mi raza es su raza

Yeah
Yeah
Yeah

Kid frost

This is big business, understand me?
Yeah, you can't take no for a answer

Welcome to the world of big business, lives get broken and made
You're walkin barefoot in a room full of razorblades
We're playin catch with a hand grenade
Cause what you faggot niggas caught
Spread you all over the asphalt
Walk the walk, talk to nobody
Spark the chrome shotie
Whenever they run up on your home, gotti
Gangsta, gangsta, read all about it
Xzibit get your whole shit crowded
And packed to capacity
You actually had the audacity
To want some problems with the x man
Lift you off your feet with the back of my left hand
Learn one of life's hard lessons
You can't negotiate with a weapon
When it's fully loaded and cocked
Hollow points shot
Next to the firing pin, with the hammer ready to drop
I took you off, so accept the loss
Crack open some olde english that's covered with frost
And it's like that

[ chorus ]
Can you feel it, nothing can save ya
For this is the season for stackin the papers

Chasin my chips till my last days
Hit a million dollar lick and split it three ways

{frost}
I'm in pursuit of them hundred dollar big faces
Wrapped in rubber bands in em bulletproof briefcases
Please understand automatically
One squeeze of the trigger cause tragedy
Casually fucked around and got your whole family mad at me
My strategy: subtract enemies mathematically
Frost will kick your head off slow, you ain't as bad as me
50/50 - half gangster, half hustler
One side's about my business, and the other side's a muthafucka
So when I creep, I crawl, I'm like swiss-made
Fuck are you, bitch-made, I slice you with my switchblade
Razor, got the h-k with the laser
Slid the enterpriser, rent a 99 black blazer
I shot straight at merino
Thousand dollar suite, layin low at the peppermint casino
I been a player before I had riches
And now I'm eatin steak and crab and fuckin bad bitches

[ chorus ]

{jayo felony}
I don't give a fuck about not one of y'all
Disrespect this here, nigga, it's real clear I'm gunnin y'all
When night falls, nah fuck, night flies a kite
I take flight like delta, nigga, helter skelter
Who the fuck could you call to help ya
Nigga, good health couldn't help ya
Put the 's' in spit, bust your tightest shit, never felt ya
Could you picture yourself in the same room when I let these off
Two rivals, suicidal, take the strap and squeeze off
But before you do it, I take the heater and shoot both your knees off
Let him suffer, can't get enough of, I'm rougher
Go get my ammunitions and paper, nigga, cause it's a habit
Let off on ya in a 600, or let's call em rabbit
Is it tragic how the automatic made you breathe like a asthmatic
Static, what's that? that shit that get up in my fabric
I'm into bitches and beamers and my chips
And I'm keepin four eyes on em schemers when I dip, bitch

Frost,"Intro:
[Frost]: This is a dramatization. The names have been changed to protect
the innocent ones not involved in the stories I'm about to tell. So 
listen up and listen up well. Here are the true accounts and incidents 
and still to me, it makes no sense. Ignorance is a major role, but 
here's a fact I feel you can ignore no more. 

Verse One:  Frost

Homicide, on the murder scene
Another frustrated gang-related senseless slaying
Victim: a young product of the project system
The sad fact is nobody's gonna miss him
True, a few may stand in disbelief, but
The majority will sigh a relief
Because of the fact he was a menace to society
And gang violence was his first priority
So, now you take a look to see what this abouta
Someone quicka with the trigga, straight cold shot him
Dead, in a puddle of blood he lay,
Another typical day in the streets of L. A. 

Homicide on the murder scene, on the murder scene, on the murder scene
Ho-Homicide on the murder scene
Homicide on the murder scene, on the murder scene, on the murder scene
Ho-Homicide on the murder scene
Ho-Homicide on the murder scene
Homicide on the murder scene, on the murder scene, on the murder scene

Verse Two:  Frost
Ho-Homicide, and just for trying to act brave
Tryin' to be a hero sent you to a early grave
The violent death, it took place at around six
And eyewitnesses say that it went like this, 
There was this lady who was chillin' in a alley
Positive I.D. included that her name was Sally
Sally had just got off the bus from a job,
When she met three young thugs who decided to rob
A man heard the screams comin' from her mouth
Ran down the deserted alley just to check it out
And when he came across the scene,
He knew what was happenin', but by then it was too late
The thugs started blastin'
Now, asked in this situation, exactly what would you do?
If you heard someone screaming, would you go to the rescue?
My man, he tried, that's hwo he died
He was shot right between the eyes
Tryin' to do a good deed, shoot, that could've been me
I'm glad I'm not the one who must explain this to his family

Homicide on the murder scene
Ho-Homicide on the murder scene
Ho-Homicide on the murder scene, on the murder scene, on the murder 
scene 
Ho-Homicide on the murder scene
Ho-Ho-Homicide on the murder scene
Ho-Homicide on the murder scene
Ho-Homicide on the murder scene
Break it down!

Verse Three:  Frost
Homicide, it's also know as manslaughter
It can be a father, mother, son, or daughter
It can happen at anyplace, at anytime
It can happen as I'm runnin' down this rhyme
First degree murder, blood flows red
One day you're alive, the next day, you're dead
Nobody seen nothin', the suspect fled
Shot on the spot with a bullet to the head
As soon as it happened, everybody broke
Nobody seen nothin', and of course nobody spoke
Bein' questioned, it doesn't pay to rat-a-tat-tat
For if you rat, you might too get the gat,
And get added to the list of those who fatally died
In the statistics, that's known as homicide

Homicide on the murder scene
Ho-Homicide on the murder scene
Ho-Homicide on the murder scene
Ho-Homicide on the murder scene
Ho-Homicide on the murder scene
Ho-Homicide on the murder scene
Ho-Homicide on the murder scene, on the murder scene, on the murder

Ho-Ho-Homicide on the murder scene
Ho-Homicide on the murder scene, on the murder scene, on the murder

Ho-Homicide on the murder scene

Ho-Homicide on the murder scene, on the murder scene, on the murder

What is time? Time is when a man is trying to make time with your
woman,
but your doing time behind bars and your time is standing still. Yo
Frost, kick it to these people for real you know what I'm saying?
[verse 1 - Frost]
Time, sits through the hour glass, through night and day
and I watch as the games people play
It's like do unto others than split
and if you can't back up what you say then you ain't shit (yeah)
I've seen the manifestations of the street
so why can't I confess what I see on a drumbeat
like just last night (yo what happened)
I watched these two vatos get in a crazy fight
one of them was quick to pull a knife
he stabbed him in the heart and now he's doing life
in prison at the age of 21 (yeah)
living on death row cause he couldn't let go
caught in the web of violence (damn)
roll deep when they creep, and move in silence of the lambs (yo)

Damn, damn ain't that a shame?
you're lost so take the caution don't play the game
should've listen to the Frost when I was trying to come across to you
but no you didn't think (sucker)
you just keep getting yourself more deep until you sink
so there's no one else to thank but yourself
so go ahead take bow for a job well done
but you'll never see the day of the sunshine or the fun times
just the old days and your old ways
corrupt and wicked
out there doing dirt, instead of just kicking it
pow pow bang bang and all that noise (yeah)
yeah you and all your homeboys
take time to read between the lines
cause ain't no sunshine

[verse 3 - Frost]
(yo kid) I know about being macho
callin' the shots the big time head honcho (yeah)
but here's something even more gacho
one of my homeboys is your old lady Sancho
yo shit happens
I know the lights of all these people right as I'm rapping
while you sit in a cell writing a letter
saying when you get out, your things will be better (right)
but man she couldn't wait
so she's going out on a date
with every Tom, Dick, and Harry
and if you ask me, your shit's getting scary
so how you gonna handle this
when your home's in Los Angeles
acting so scandalous
yo, you can't blame her you didn't take the time
and now, ain't no sunshine

Between love and hate
It's a thin line
Between love and hate

Three in the morning
My pager reads your number
And at that point, I realized, just starting to wonder
Where I'm at
What I'm doin' and all that
I could have called, but instead
I just sat back
Cause I've been calling you since ten
And now, it's three
I'm not your puppet on a string
So I'm letting you know, it's that
Hates trip
That's it's a thin line
Between love and hate

I know it's wrong, you've been doing it big in love
So now it's time to let you know what's up
Do you remember
Early December, you told me, ""Don't
Come over, because
Of the cold and rainy weather""
But

Knock, knock, knock
Who is it

Frost gon' let me
Down

Well, you know I won't let you down
Just remember that

It's
Five in the morning, and you're still tryin' to get through
Swearin' to Frost for hangin' out with the crew
But baby
If this keeps going on
I can't
And just like I can't, I'm gone
We been through
Thick and thin
Good and bad
Arguments lost soon as I walked through the pad
But I need you, trip from the gate
Cause it's a thin line
Between love and gate

I know it's wrong, you've been doing it big in love

This is big business, understand me?
Yeah, you can't take no for a answer

Welcome to the world of big business, lives get broken and made
You're walkin barefoot in a room full of razorblades
We're playin catch with a hand grenade
Cause what you faggot niggas caught
Spread you all over the asphalt
Walk the walk, talk to nobody
Spark the chrome shotie
Whenever they run up on your home, Gotti
Gangsta, gangsta, read all about it
Xzibit get your whole shit crowded
And packed to capacity
You actually had the audacity
To want some problems with the X Man
Lift you off your feet with the back of my left hand
Learn one of life's hard lessons
You can't negotiate with a weapon
When it's fully loaded and cocked
Hollow points shot
Next to the firing pin, with the hammer ready to drop
I took you off, so accept the loss
Crack open some Olde English that's covered with frost
And it's like that

Can you feel it, nothing can save ya
For this is the season for stackin the papers

Chasin my chips till my last days
Hit a million dollar lick and split it three ways

I'm in pursuit of them hundred dollar big faces
Wrapped in rubber bands in em bulletproof briefcases
Please understand automatically 
One squeeze of the trigger cause tragedy
Casually fucked around and got your whole family mad at me
My strategy: subtract enemies mathematically
Frost will kick your head off slow, you ain't as bad as me
50/50 - half gangster, half hustler
One side's about my business, and the other side's a muthafucka
So when I creep, I crawl, I'm like Swiss-made
Fuck are you, bitch-made, I slice you with my switchblade
Razor, got the H-K with the laser
Slid the Enterpriser, rent a 99 black Blazer
I shot straight at Merino
Thousand dollar suite, layin low at the Peppermint Casino
I been a player before I had riches
And now I'm eatin steak and crab and fuckin bad bitches

Can you feel it, nothing can save ya
For this is the season for stackin the papers

Chasin my chips till my last days
Hit a million dollar lick and split it three ways

I don't give a fuck about not one of why'all
Disrespect this here, nigga, it's real clear I'm gunnin why'all
When night falls, nah fuck, night flies a kite
I take flight like Delta, nigga, helter skelter
Who the fuck could you call to help ya
Nigga, good health couldn't help ya
Put the 's' in spit, bust your tightest shit, never felt ya
Could you picture yourself in the same room when I let these off
Two rivals, suicidal, take the strap and squeeze off
But before you do it, I take the heater and shoot both your knees off
Let him suffer, can't get enough of, I'm rougher
Go get my ammunitions and paper, nigga, cause it's a habit
Let off on ya in a 600, or let's call em rabbit
Is it tragic how the automatic made you breathe like a asthmatic
Static, what's that? That shit that get up in my fabric
I'm into bitches and beamers and my chips
And I'm keepin four eyes on em schemers when I dip, bitch

And the homey Kurupt about to blow shit up

Have you trippin' like some sherm when we bounce through yo' hood
We make it happen, from the nickel plate to the platinum
It's real shit, think of it, just musical rappin'

Check it out
I'ma tell you what it is when you're fuckin' with a gangsta like me
Throw some gold feet on the MC
Bounce up and down the street with a trunk full of beats
Swervin' up a one-way, dippin' on a Sunday
Not givin' a fuck nigga Frost and Kurupt

Whatchu wann' do, blaze a ounce with a nigga
Blaze up a stick and bounce with a nigga

Eses load up, with them East side soldiers
Roll up a fat one and pass it around
Hide the stash and cash, when my dogs hit town

Man let the summer begin
The heat excites the east siders
Ain't nothin' but G's and low riders
Dippin' in the tightest, indoed out, benzoed out
Fool we got the Henn no doubt
My friends show out, we stack up ends and roll out
Make sure the chronic smoke blows out
Them tricks got no clout, cause they hatin' how we serve it
Don't test T-Loc it ain't worth it, I serve it

I'm tired of these bitch made niggaz
Actin like they comin' through with hammers and triggers
I'll pull your whole card, nigga you ain't hard
Your homey's a bitch on the left with dick on his breath
I make fo's hop, what the fuck do you do
I done smacked around bitch niggaz just like you
A gangsta's a gangsta and that's all I'll be

Throwin' up the hood for life
Movin in loco-motion, heated cause it's on

Now ain't no mercy when we dealin' with these putos
Ask the homey Kurupt, he said the feelin' is mutual
We lay em down on site, on GP
Hit em up for la raza and for DPG

I got a cannon for the bustas, fuck the world

What is time? Time is when a man is trying to make time with your
woman,
but your doing time behind bars and your time is standing still. Yo
Frost, kick it to these people for real you know what I'm saying?
[verse 1 - Frost]
Time, sits through the hour glass, through night and day
and I watch as the games people play
It's like do unto others than split
and if you can't back up what you say then you ain't shit (yeah)
I've seen the manifestations of the street
so why can't I confess what I see on a drumbeat
like just last night (yo what happened)
I watched these two vatos get in a crazy fight
one of them was quick to pull a knife
he stabbed him in the heart and now he's doing life
in prison at the age of 21 (yeah)
living on death row cause he couldn't let go
caught in the web of violence (damn)
roll deep when they creep, and move in silence of the lambs (yo)

should've listen to the Frost when I was trying to come across to you
but no you didn't think (sucker)
you just keep getting yourself more deep until you sink
so there's no one else to thank but yourself
so go ahead take bow for a job well done
but you'll never see the day of the sunshine or the fun times
just the old days and your old ways
corrupt and wicked
out there doing dirt, instead of just kicking it
pow pow bang bang and all that noise (yeah)
yeah you and all your homeboys
take time to read between the lines
cause ain't no sunshine
[chorus]
[verse 3 - Frost]
(yo kid) I know about being macho
callin' the shots the big time head honcho (yeah)
but here's something even more gacho
one of my homeboys is your old lady Sancho
yo shit happens
I know the lights of all these people right as I'm rapping
while you sit in a cell writing a letter
saying when you get out, your things will be better (right)
but man she couldn't wait
so she's going out on a date
with every Tom, Dick, and Harry
and if you ask me, your shit's getting scary
so how you gonna handle this
when your home's in Los Angeles
acting so scandalous
yo, you can't blame her you didn't take the time
and now, ain't no sunshine

Be like most these kids who chat sh*t
S*ck record company dick.
Frost P, I keep it gutter.

Still bills I'm payin', still for meals I'm prayin'

In the meanwhile, I stayed me and wait,
They life ain't great,
But's better than the jobs from state,
For makin' it, mate, just a Q and A.

Still ghetto wit they mind of a needle
Quicker than a cheetah,
Draw nine millimeter up.
Grab a man's chain

If I get shifty, never in vain
Ain't life, but I stay in they game
Yeah the prodicial's the same

Steady, walk forward in my Timberland boots
And I still ready to shoot, you need proof?

Show it any time
Fuck a label, I never get signed!
More time, niggas wanna leave me behind.
Tell me to put my name on they dotted line.

Ya find, the way I am contracts to they street
Come around, will you?
In the last two weeks, you're too weak.

I still represent Hays Town.
Though it's my proximity, my boy face down.
Murder mans, niggas fast like a greyhound
Quick to run in the bank, and tell ya lay down.

Style to the manner, got a place in the manor
Like a .38, always come back to the man-ner.
That's grammar.

Use it punk, big like they clumps.
You versus me equals my car trunk.

Remember they time when you got slaughtered,

Words they is jerkin' in they House of Parliament.

With out they words, with out they verbs
Little boys left on they kerb.
People, lift them up before dey get hurt.
But their heart rate stop (beeep)
When they have just learned

That I'm above they flow
Leave yer mind in high-low
Like they center of a polo, push
Can't enter his height when I'm so low,
Yah, yeh don't know, so --

None a yer words can hurt me, fool.
None a yer combacks mean f*k, fool.
Nuffin' you say can hurt me, fool.
I feel bad, pity for you.

Rue the lack of sense.

Where yer car? harhar! A domestic life

Hup-two-three-four, I'm goin' to war,
To win and leave the runner-up sore. (ow!)

Distress.

Doesn't spit about a rattle man's chest


Accordings to these angles, if dere was a circle
Yeah! -- play, boy, but I know my swivin' hurt you.


I take you for a joke, so you get laffed at (haha)
Yer a basic MC, boy. I'm done -- past it.

Cause my microphone sample is in they silence,
Leaving, yeh suddenly need stabilizers.
Yeah wanted to battle me like an idiot.
But I'll show everyone (sure!) here that yerr not
Ready yet.

I'll leave you body wrapped, body bagged, in a closed hearse.
Leff it in they church, can I really get worse?
Cannot rilly know that I jes silly caught, seen me

But I'm still here, cause I move like the wind.

Goin' to make havoc -- spit til I choke.
How could anyone ever better me for a joke.
See they tick-tock? on they body clock, I put it on stop.
If you wanna come and drop a lyric, there is no top.

But if you had it, you still couldn't rhyme
You still couldn't write (nah) in beat to dis time
So you never get close enough to me to attack.
You take two steps forward, but three steps back.


Cause I'm daily separatin' mens day out day in,
Leaving them with no self-esteem, meditating
And don't think of it, Unless its how I'll make you lose your confidence.
Even how you spittin on dis track is never-never lan'.


Your sh*t
You. can't. spit. and. it's. better. dat. you. quit.
Leave. it. to Shystie. that. spits. hot toxic.

Frost P! Bruce Grove N17. Z-U!
Let's take down these dudd birds. (nice)

Yo, I used both of these girls mouth
Like pick-up sex in a condom they beef is on.
And your Miss Dynamite
Impressions ain't botherin' no one.
So thanks but nah. Get yer own slogan!

Take that! Matter of fact, get off they track.
I'm too classy to go back-to-back
With your average hood-rats.

What you know about markin' yer game
Up yer walls? Nuffin.
Spittin crap at yer sympathizers. (nuffin!)

Treat yeh frauds like Kit-Kat
-- ""Give 'em a break!""
Cause yer unknown and fake,
Cause yer bound to hate.

Dey wanna beee like us!! (I know)
But they're featherweight,
And I'm a heavyweight.
Eatin' MCs like ready-break.

If that's the case, imagine what the skets get slapped.
Quick and exit. (huh huh)
And home it crept. Must be men!

'Cos you had the balls to steppin' into a rep
But you get blazed off they set.
Trust if you be Sovereign, I'm Benson and hedges
Don't to trust get me like anesthetics.
Even wif Gab's compressor, ya still sound lesser.
So don't get it twisted, girls -- you aint better.

Man, I take down your whole 'hood with my four wood.
You hear they way I flow, and you really wish you could.

Never dat! Too many rhymes, too many lines.
For the amateurs like you, I ain't got they time.

Before we clean their clocks.

I spit sick rhymes, my styles
Better den yours, times ten.
I rhyme couple time, I punish you in line,
You could never take Zuz for a spin.

'Cos this isn't nevah-nevah
I'm tougher dan evah.
My vendetta is simply payback
Write lyrics with no pen, no paper.

Hate-ers never prosper. (yep)
So get lost like change down the sofa.

Garage doesn't matter to me.
'Cos if Shystie is on battlin' me
She's ready to see, R.O. is old school
Like bullet-hole jeans (whew)

-- when they bullet goes in
I used to shop work to get a gold fing.
For sure, I'm talkin', my fro's clean.
Yo, my 'fro's clean, just like the po sheets
Better listen up when R.O. speaks.

So all of my worrds are hurrrtin' you.
And yer both damn, sound like dudes.
Why would not you got a better fing to do?
Easily kill you hos, I won't lose. ZU-ZU!

In the MC game, I put a lame MC to shame.
You've only got yourself to blame.
Tame your voice when you talk big my sh*t is real
I kill your little kids like mornin'-after pills
-- So chill.

When you walked in, I met ends, it's not happenin'.
I still strappin' my nine, I still rappin' part time.

Sun gun me down and burn me

My head distorts reality

Madness just moved into my shadow

Shine, I will be there for me

I'll shine, shine

Who waltzed me into this
Am I now stuck here forever
Luck just gave me a kiss
Then lashed me down with a leather strap

Trying to learn to swim without any water
Trying just to begin just when
You're in for the slaughter, yeah

Shine, I will not cry and I will not die no

Frozen Cast Ensemble,"Que ce passe t-il mon ange?
Pourquoi refusez-vous les avances d'un si beau garçon?

Est-ce parce que qu'il marche de travers?

Ou qu'il a mauvais caractère?

Ou ces drôles de poires qui lui servent de pieds?

Pour se laver il attend la pluie
Il a son odeur bien à lui

Mais on ne connaît personne d'aussi
Tendre et attentionné!

Il est peut-être un peu moins que parfait
Il est peu raffiné

Son cerveau à l'envers

Sa passion pour les cerfs

C'est vrai qu'il à l'air un peu perturbé!

Il est peut-être un peu moins que parfait
Mais on est sûrs qu'un jour
Il pourra devenir presque parfait
Il suffit d'un peu d'amour!

S'il vous plaît, est-ce qu'on pourrait changer de sujet?
Nous sommes là parce que nous avons un véritable problème

Ça se voit, alors dites-moi trésor
Est-ce parce que c'est un gros peureux?

Que des amis il en a peu?

Ou qu'il aime faire pipi dans l'herbe au fond des bois?
Quoi?

Dites pas que vous le trouvez laid
C'est un charmant petit blondinet

Son humilité cache l'âme et la bonté d'un roi

Il est peut-être un peu moins que parfait
Les poux et les puces l'aiment bien
Cette drôle d'attitude
C'est la solitude
Il n'a pas l'habitude des gros câlins!
Il est peut-être un peu moins que parfait
Mais nous savons pourquoi
Il faut que vous fassiez le premier pas
Allez, on compte jusqu'à trois

Ça suffit, elle a déjà quelqu'un
Cette jeune fille est fiancée!

Elle est peut-être un peu moins que parfaite

Tout ça est très vague

Elle n'est que fiancée
Tout ça peut s'arranger

Oui, d'autant plus qu'elle n'a pas de bague!

Elle est peut-être un peu moins que parfaite
Elle est toute chamboulée!
Débarrassons-nous du fiancé
Et là tout sera réglé!

N'essayez pas de le changer
Ici-bas nul n'est parfait
Mais l'amour est un sentiment fort
Qui reste plein de secrets
On fait de mauvais choix
Quand on est triste ou qu'on a peur
Donnons aux autres un peu d'amour

Donnons aux autres un peu d'amour!

Ça les rendra meilleurs!

Oui, l'amour rend meilleur!
Oui, nous sommes tous un peu moins que parfaits!
Sinon ce ne serait pas drôle!

Le père!

La sœur!

Le frère!

On a tous besoin les uns des autres
Chacun son rôle
C'est vrai on est tous un peu moins que parfaits
Mais comme il faut faire court

Ce qui rend presque parfaits
Les gens un peu moins que parfaits c'est

L'amour!
L'amour!
L'amour, c'est l'amour!
C'est l'amour, l'amour, l'amour!

It could melt a frozen heart if it needs to be so

It's the place to cut the weeds and wires
And dodge the thorns and quills
It's the place divides divide
Where the river stands still

It is time to weather stormy seas
And suck the venom clear
We could clean the poison pains
And while we are here

We could shake the buzzards off our tails
And keep the snakes at bay
Hear the sirens fade and the thunder rumble away

Its the place tectonic plates will pass each other not to touch
That's the sound of the new silent life

It's the place where all divides divide and the rivers all stand still
That's the sound of the new silent life

When your time, and your money, and your best girl are gone
You can't go back if the road keeps moving along
Can't go back if the road keeps moving along
Cause someday a tremor'll pull your cities into the sea
You can't win a battle a fight with the forces of gravity
You can't stand up if gravities dragin' ya down
Can't stand up if gravities dragin' ya down
Down in the trench when you find yourself in the tiger's jaws
And the fire in your belly and piss and vinegers gone

God's no better than me, just bigger is all
God's no better than us, just bigger is all",Traveler's Song,2005
Fruit Bats,"There is peace in the belly of the beast
There is no alarm in the least

Ride the tides to take them home to empty webs and
From the land of sky blue waters to the belly of the beast

There is calm in the valley of the dogs
There is light in the caves and in the bogs

There was a man from the end of the world
The weary weird end of the world

And fell dreaming of his best girl

And he came back as a goat before he came back as a ghost
And he was worn away by the rain and the rivers
And he found himself on his own
But he is not alone being on his own

At the tender under age

Just me and my unusual friend

Playing songs to the magic box
'Til through holes in the old rotten roof snowed the cold light of the morning
Back when you, substitute for girls
Surrogate for food and the passer of the time
In the aching dehydrated dawn
With my bruised up heart on the mend
And I'd hold you in my hand
Yeah I'll miss you my unusual friend

I knew that if you stuck around
One weird warm night you'd sneak in my room and kill me

Your eyes a bit misty and so sincere
Where the rivers were veins so relentlessly pumping
And the sky was a monster made out of tears

I recall when you woke up and told me another
Of huge uncontrollable helium hands
And an antelope's heart and a quiver of arrows
were the gifts that you got from the primitive man

Or the time you were screaming and sweating and crying
Dreaming of a ride in a leaky raft
Down the rivers, the veins so relentlessly pumping
Deep into the heart of the primitive man

You'll always eat bread if you always have seeds to sow
Like old Zen Ben who lived with a murder of crows
He wore a crown of beans
And a belt of weeds
Slept alone in the warm wet fields on a bed of mustard seed

Cause he'd loved her from the time she'd been the waitress at the Mexican place where he'd left his keys

She'd been there smiling at the lost and found
Then he took her to see Three Dog Night
They were playing at the fair grounds
Holding hands singing ""Joy to the World""

She was way too young but he did not care
He was all right with cashing in
a few fine moments before his broken heart kicked in

He died a little bit each time the night came in
And the stars fell over Michigan
'Cause he'd loved her at the bar when he saw her dancing to
""I Could Never Take the Place of Your Man""

Then he'd come over to his usual spot
Soon they were making out at 3AM in the empty parking lot
They lay together under the burnt out stars

She never loved him back

But he was fine to just pretend
That it was never gonna end
And it was worth it just to know

Was a frozen wave that killed the yucca and the Adam's fig

My family moved us ever northward up to the terra borealis
Along the crooked pikes of the ruminants and voyageurs
But my heart belongs to the smoke of Hamilton and Monongahela
And all the dirty cities along the way

But you know they all lied to you
Them there with the spider eyes
It'll always keep you warm
It'll always treat you nice

I was floated in just this morning
Woke up a thousand miles from nowhere
I'm a broke-legged paint in a herd of unicorns y'know
I always seem to bring the gray skies every time I ever fly
From all the dirty cities along the way

But you know they all lied to you
These folks with the spider eyes
I'll always keep you warm
I'll always treat you nice

I'll never snow on your parade
I'll never bring a cloudy day

Thank you all so very much you crossers of the many time zones

Yo, somebody please tell me...
What's the meaning of life?
Yo, somebody gots to help me
Yo, what's the meaning of life?
Yo, somebody please tell me...

I look inside the mirror and look in myself, I'm hopin' for help
Everyday I'm hopin' for a brand new strife
The shores of North America, I'm bound to survive
Though I'm not the same, yo I carry a gift
Tricked and sold his cargo on the bowels of ships
But yo, I got my pride, tighten up my stand
Lookin' at the stars, the original man...
Never thought that it would ever come to this
Migrate really wasn't a time when life was great
I want to go home to the Bering Straights
A place where I know where my kid's is safe
Thoughts of runnin' foul like a rampant disease
Yet, my skin tone really couldn't bring the ease
Gettin' weaker by the day, months and years
Thousands of years we reign, but now I shed a tear

[Chorus:]
Yo, what's the meaning of life?
Yo, somebody please tell me...
What's the meaning of life?
Yo, somebody got's to help me
Yo, what's the meaning of life?
Yo, but do you know?

Inhale and exhale the breath of mist
Each and every day a new way to exist
Don't want to use a gun, shoot drugs and dope
Don't want to wear a cross, 'cause it brings no hope
In the beginnin' as we know, started back in the land
Well defined, their complexion was just like mines
Come to find we was lead and upon direct
Now we cheat, steal and kill and lost all respect
How much pain would you take before you break the chain?
Most of us don't even care, we was planted with fear
We say the babies are the future, but what's the fuss?
Broken homes, growin' up, they act worse than us
Since we all been double-crossed, sins we wear with pride
Believe the lies, yet, still ain't open our eyes
Lookin' forward to the day that I fast and pray
These is questions that I always say

[Chorus:]

Goin' through a struggle, yeah it's hard at first
Bein' put down, shunned, ragged, tagged and dragged
The inner strength leave the soul through a body of one
Can't be mad, yo, I'm glad, 'cause I know where I'm from
Priceless, I'm like a treasure, I can't be touched
Made an image of myself from the grains of dust
Mold and shape the woman with the curves of a snake
Travel light years away and then return to base
Eliminatin' evil's more like a daily chore
Teachin' my ways, that's how I spend most of my days
Balance attack, never been scared to be black
Manifestin' only actual facts
Savin' the kids, spreadin' love, yo, that's how to life
Justice is my reward for the acts that I did
Think about all the things in time, seek and you'll find

The only question didn't get an answer
Where we're coming from and where we're going to
On this dawn, leading us from somewhere?

Out of darkness we came, and land on mark these days
But to us
Guideless we let and fall just these ways
By these ways

For me, religion isn't just a tale
Telling from past times
It tells about a meeting
Between us and astronauts from distant stars
You have to read between the lines! 

Thousands of girls before loved angels
And want rescue ends
For if I look around, now all aware
Drop very same wond'ring face
By, by, Oh! 

Now all alone, it will take me along from here
Before you see offset

One day, when we fly at the speed of light
We'll find a star and not the human race

You try to unblock the understanding
And keep slowly blight and may be even bright
In time, too long era to last
Will I want go to the sun?

Gather, became a house of fools
With flaming roof and based on sand below
Heaven, got sagged and saled on mourning
But prepared by the inner soul
But break down, but break soon brings good

By, by, by the way
We really could find the answer
Where we're coming from and where we're going to
On this good dawn, leading us from somewhere

Out of darkness we came, and land on mark these days

Guideless we let and fall just these ways

Naughty, naughty, very naughty 
Ha ha ha ha ha 

There's a guy in the place 
He's got a bittersweet face 
And he goes by the name of Ebeneezer Goode 
His friends call him Eezer and he is the main geezer 
And he'll vibe about the place like no other man could 
He's refined, he's sublime, he makes you feel fine 
Though very much maligned and misunderstood 
But if you know Eezer he's a real crowd pleaser 
He's ever so good, he's Ebeneezer Goode 
You can see that he's mischievous, mysterious and devious 
When he circulates amongst the people in the place 
But once you know he's fun and something of a genius 
He gives a grin that goes around from face to face to face 
Backwards and then forwards, forwards and then backwards 
Eezer is the geezer who loves to muscle in 
That's about the time the crowd all shout the name of Eezer 
As he's kotcheled in the corner, laughing by the bass bin

He created the vibe 
He takes you for a ride and as if by design 
The party ignites like he's comin alive 
He takes you to the top, shakes you all around 
Then back down, you know as he gets mellow

Lives an old German's daughter
By the banks of the old river Rhine
Where I loved her and left her
But I can't forget her
'Cause I miss my pretty Fraulein
 
Fraulein, Fraulein
Look up toward the heavens each night
When the stars seem to shine
By the same stars above you
I swear that I love you
You are my pretty Fraulein
 
When my memories wander
Away over yonder
To the sweetheart that I left behind
In a moment of glory
A face comes before me
The face of my pretty Fraulein

Walk down by the river
Pretend that your hand's holding mine
By the same stars above you
I swear that I love you

Love me now, for now is all the time there may be.

Far away, far away.

Our castle was poor but we never were sad
We learned to be happy
We'd dance round the hall
And learning to count was the key to it all
By counting each count I knew just where to start
And one special step has stayed close to my heart

One two three, spread out the cape
One two three, twirl round the floor
One two three, left foot you swing
One two three, then start to sing
One two three, loud as you please
One two three, counting with ease
One two three, doing the batty bat
Batty batty bat batty bat batty bat batty bat
One two three count
Batty batty bat batty bat batty bat batty bat
won't you dance with me doing the batty bat

So now in my own castle I can enjoy
This wonderful dance that I learned as a boy
I see just how wise was my whole family
They taught me to count and so now look at me
I'm counting and dancing and I swear that it's true
If you do the same you will be happy too

One two three, twirl round the floor

Rivaled by none

Rings and spikes and chains and tattoos

She woke up and took me by the hand
She's gonna love me in my Chevy van
And that's all right with me

Her long legs were tanned and brown
Better keep your eyes on the road son
Better slow this vehicle down

Moonlight dancing off her hair
She woke up and took me by the hand
She's gonna love me in my Chevy van
And that's all right with me

I put her out in a town that was so small
You could throw a rock from end to end
A dirt road main street, she walked off in barefeet
It's a shame I won't be passin' through again

'Cause like a princess she was laying there
Moonlight dancing off her hair
She woke up and took me by the hand
We made love in my Chevy van
And that's all right with me

Put it by number one phenomenon
Come follow me now, mon
'cause Mr. Chip Fu is the Don
I think I'll tikki than I will tembo
Then I will no-so, then I will rembo
Paribari rucheep yo, Poc pass me that pen, yo, right
They can't catch this lyrical style that's wicked and wild
That I display
Slick and I'm quick with the rhyme tactic
Taught and brought by the teacher and the sinsa
So if you come test, I'm badder than the rest
Style and technique is perfect
Fighting and writing these lyrical styles my hobby and favorite subject
Buddha taught me and it brought me
Lyrical styles which is true
Done by the A the E the I, I mean Chip Fu
I drippity-drop on hip-hop
I love rub-a-dub because it's crisp
So you really got to rock, you really got to twist
You got to listen to this

He can't test you, he's a wimp
He'll be walking with a limp
So don't try to test Chip Fu, you fantail shrimp
What are you, Bullwinkle or Rocky
Don't start no beef or broccoli
So give it up, you lost, or you better duck sauce

Hey, check out our lyrical style, it's versatile
And while, yeah, we still get smiles
I bet you never heard nobody rhyme like us
We kick our rhymes like crazy fools
Eat MC's like Cheese Doodles
By Banton, yo, Pass the wanton soup, troop
He's talking caca
Yo, what's the shock of the day, hey
Say moo-goo-gai-pan, man, hey, I thought he was gay
So hold his wrist up
Now, I'm going to have to twist off his arm
Like my boy Chip-Fu said, you should have ""ringed the alarm""
He call you Buckwheat, with bucked teeth
Tall with Daffy Duck feet
Now that's for having on Bruce Lees
Your techniques stale, of course you'll fail
Against the super-dope fly ebony male
Ducktales! Huey, Duey, Louie, Fuey, chop suey
Egg foo young's on my tongue, hey, that's kind of gooey
I chopsticks with drop kicks
My chow mein's plain
I do the Tiger, the Snake, and the big daddy Crane

Why means the mic gets ignited and MC's don't understand
Down with the cop, the com, the Moc and Poc
I love pih poh, which is hip hop
This backwards lyrical style that I drop from the pot ytippit, the tippity 
top
So give me the cim, in otherwords the mic
This style is epyh, oops, I mean hype

(3x)

Ring the alarm, I don't want to stay calm cause
I'm about to rip this psalm
When the mic is gripped my lyrics do split up like
Bombs from Vietnam
Cause I'm sweet, neat, I don't romp or skinteet
Lyrics I lick with my tongue
And rhymes I nymn with my teeth
This lyrical prophet you can't stop this from the West Indies
You can tell I'm a lyrical prophet from the words spoken and broken up
In these books and scrolls that I unfold
The knowledge I use does make me bold
The intelligence in my system
Converts itself and becomes wisdom
Born in Trinidad, not Tobogo, land of steel pan and calypso
Cyop is a buck and a buck is a cyop
That's the real true thing and a natural fact
This lyrical man you can't hold me back
From the red, the white, and also the black
Island, which is my land, my place of birth
You can tell by the tongue that's swung
And the lyrical structure in me verse
So all MC's don't cross this border
Cause by now you should know sort of
Lyrically wise but now I despise
All youth that's out of order
Don't try to test any of the Schnikens
Cause I'm not done with the lyrical boxin'
The beatin' and the lickin'

Ring the alarm, another sound is dying, whoa, aye

You two-facety, you can't face me
And my rhymes you'll bite and learn
Soon you'll acknowledge my lyrical substance just like a bookworm
Chip FU, then you will extend and show all the youth them
That me big boutcha under roots and culture
And the bad bull in the pen
Because when I grip the mic (yes, man)
All MC's they do stop yes and hush
Any mic I touch, any mic I brush, any mic I clutch
With these lyrical styles of such
And if I do unleash a lyrical masterpiece
Lyrics never cease, then a piece I'll unleash and make it brief
Please don't bite yes or thief
see-H-I-P FU is my name, it will stay just the same
Give me any mic on stage in a rage I'll engage
And drop rhymes just the same
Quote for quote, note for note, did you comphrehend
So jack it up and pull it up operator
Wheel and come again
Cause MC's try these rastafarianic raps and sound like want to-be's
But a want to-be's not what I want to be
See the FU-Schnickens have to be
The true prophets free
Free to preach FU-Schnick prophecies
We thee untouchable, matchable, stoppable MC's for unity
Me, a rastafarian, no not me but I do stun
I'm not faking Jamacian, so all MC's you better run
Because Mr. Chip FU man a come
And me sitdong pon de riddim sitdong pion de vibes
A de hartical don
True me full up a style and me wicked and wild
With peer pattern watch how me chat it in a verb
And capsize it in a noun
Uno better give I and I respect
When this Trinidadian I come
Sing out

Phenomenon one, phenomenon two, phenomenon three
Come follow me
POC FU's the rough-neck chicken and I'm the wild Apache
See I'm the see the H the I the P
Down with the P the O the see, the K the you the N the G
The M the O, yes and the see
And when the M the I the see is in my H the A-N-D
I preach and teach and educate all ghetto youth about unity
But wait, let me get set not to sweat
But to get something straight
All MC's come out with good styles
And all of them do sound great
But ring the alarm and don't stay calm
Because I won't procrastinate
These lyrical styles that I compile
To preach and teach and educate me
A new jack brother (who's that)
When you were at the parties rapping and scratching I did a chat
On tape, on tape and cassette, you'll hear me live and direct
Yes and who never hear me yet when you hear my voice it's perfect
So just pack up because your lyrics are weak when you speak
Don't step so just back up, wake up, take off the make-up
The mic because I'll break up
MC's limbs from limb, slim me trim
You see me, I don't follow no style and I don't follow no pattern
So take head to this lesson I bring or the lesson I brought
Which was taught to one and another
All slack MC's better ring the alarm

Phife Dawg was never the type that ever lacked skills
I just stay true to my roots and then I get ill
Twenty years of age, but yet I still see knowledge
And this year, was so-called, my Senior year in collega
But I chose to pursue, in a field called music
And with some hype beats and breaks you know I won't refuse it
Get on the board lay down the track and I'll do ten laps
Pass the pen, pass the pad, and I'll kick nuff RAPS
Just come inside your jam and witness who is boss
And it won't be Tony Danza nor Diana Ross
As small as I am, I still can pack jams
Do a freestyle, and step, but yet I still slam
Not tryin to say that no one can get with me
Not only is it the lyrics I write, it's my delivery
Name one rapper that you know who has this high-strung voice
My name's Malik and I'm unique, in other words top choice

I gets so busy on the mic with my rythmic flows
That's bound to leave you bangin' when it gets exposed
'cause the way I could display my style is wicked
So run up to your counters, and go and get your tickets
I know you got dreams of roasting me hot
But I got flavor like that candy in your grocery shop

And nadic, with the crazy flow that's automatic
Flowin' like them bolts from the sky like Zeus

Hang with me, come with the steez and see I'm no actor

Yo, can this be the funkdafied horror

See, er, the blur in my eyes rectifies
The funk freak me, so peep me, as I speak the grammer
I rocks my bandanna, shave my head clean
And on my screens than Vanna White
How should I roll when I write?
Then light the spliff, now it's time to recite
a verse, a hurse you be leavin' in

And science fiction, my addiction is the funk

So wrought by what I've done, I wouldn't wish it on anyone. 
A young couple meets and falls in love and live so happily ever after, it's a platitude. 
But it's a lie, affections unrequited.

Don't offer me solace because I don't believe. 

I couldn't watch quietly and I won't pretend to understand. 
I won't feign piety, but why would God choose to be a
The dimmest bulb in that factory tore her away and our hearts still bleed. 
I couldn't watch quietly and I don't pretend to understand. 
I won't feign piety, but why would God choose to be a man

And what of the fate of Veronica dear, he manipulates you with crocodile tears. 
And I can't pretend that it's alright that his human darkness snuffed her light. 

So fathers, don't cast your blame. 
In my place you'd do the same. 
And mother, do what thou wilt, it erodes us like the silt. 
Their sons destroy our world by stealing your little girls. 
The daughter you've loved from birth slumbers beneath the earth.
 
So ask yourself, what is one life worth when measured against the children we birthed?

He knows that his joy will stop, waiting for the other shoe to drop. 
He's a ship on the sea, setting sail to perfidy. 
He is cold, he is warm, he's the peace inside the storm. 
Feel the swelling of a wave, hear the ringing of a bell, 
He's been weak and he's been brave, he's been to heaven and he's been to hell. 
See the old in the new, see the life stretch before you, 
See a mother in the child, there was youth behind grey eyes. 
I don't know him anymore, he isn't like he was before. 
A stone is taken by the tide, another season on the other side. 
Like the spinning of a wheel, he'll be hurt but he will heal. 

There's a flower in the weeds, there's a life inside the seed.

(But then the seasons turned and the darkness came) 
""So when it all falls apart I will have peace in my heart"" 
(Try to think of the healing that comes out of the pain). 
""Try to redeem myself for mistakes in advance"", 
(The sun will always shine after the rain) 
""I know that when I fall down I'll get another chance"" 
(Just wipe away the tears and try again). 

We couldn't see without the dark, thing's wouldn't end without a spark. 
There is no truth without lies and no future without memories. 
He's in the middle of the road, from where he's been and where he'll go. 
He's the forest kissed by flames, the trees die so they can grow again. 
He knows that death is part of life, he would have made that girl his wife. 
Now there's only darkness, there is no dawn, now that she's gone.

Negative epidemic, followers of Hume. 
He understands all her needs, 
And for that she loves him eternally. 
Syncretism is so natural 
They're experiencing something so actual.

She's unstuck him from his rut. 
He couldn't wait to run off

Se nos activan los sentidos
Se corta la respiración

Ella baila y se me acerca pa mí

Fuerza de Tijuana,"Es el hijo del Señor
Otro tiempo interrumpió 
En el poder que ejercía no a caído a hacer todo
La noticia que llego 
Como bomba al que pego 
La gente que no creía el niño en televisión 

Ahora sí que esto dolió 
Dijo sin consolación 
Te requiero que es padrino hombre fuerte a la nación 
Tridentinas al instante 
Y de tonos responsables 
Para sí se enojo el padre

Hubo tiempos de alegría
Y también gozó en la vida
Con su madre y sus hermanos muy feliz con su familia
Distinciones importantes
Enseñanzas desde grande

Escuela como ninguna, él la lleva en la sangre
Su sonrisa pa' delante
Su mirada dessfiante
Porque él sabe sus cosas y él sabe porque las hace
Si no su gente adelante
Con luto a la attaque 
Orgulloso de su padre 

Sabe que lo llevamos muy dentro
Pura Fuerza pero de Tijuana

Hay relampagos y truenos
Erequinzas y los cuernos
Cuando el hombre aparecía se cuadraban al momento
Como amigo es sincero 
Su familia que es primero
Su gente que sigue firme esperando su regreso
Muy momento que es eterno 
Cuando duele el recuerdo
Si todo marchaba bien de donde salio el gobierno
Era un sigue vigente 
Aún sigue presente
Leyenda que no muere

Si nombras hasta el corrido
Porque así fue decidido
El que sabe ya lo sabe yo no estoy pa' darles clase
Todos siguen operando
Apoyando los muchachos
Hay un gordo hay un flaco, hay uno como Ángel llamado
Él se fue con los caballos
Diz que van a juzgarlo
El cazoba en secreto sepan los involucrados
Yo no sé y lo inventado
Pero en el futuro 
Es el pasado",Leyenda que no Muere,2017
Fuerza de Tijuana,"Andan en la lumbre
Y se rifan el cuero
Ganando dinero
Arriesgan la vida
Andan bien activos
Cuidando el terreno
De un hombre importante
Que es dueño y domina

Con buenos blindajes
Y bien protegidos
Todos bien armados
100% unidos
Cuidan a Tijuana
De los enemigos
Y si alguien la cruza
Nunca saldrán vivos

Juntan la experiencia
Con la inteligencia
Rompiendo cadenas

Fugative,"Mixed up, I'm in two minds, 
So lost with different signs.
She never wants me all to herself,
Only around at convenient times.
Why do some girls play so hard,
It takes one glance to have you fallin'.
I never thought she was that kinda girl,
To like me more when the phone stops calling

You said you were a good girl
Your actions say more
You keep playing games

You know you like a bad girl
Someone who will play games 
Treat you like a toy
You keep beggin for more

You seem to like me more

You know you like a bad girl, bad girl, bad girl, bad girl
You know you like it when I treat you bad

Now lets go back to the start
That day when I saw your face
You told me baby don't break my heart
I been there before and don't wanna take part
So I'm try'na treat you right
But we just keep going round
One minute you want my heart
But when I reply your no where to be found
So lets just stop with the games
'Cause I cant take anymore
My friends keep saying its time for a change
But I don't ever listen, I choose to ignore

You had me where you want me
But not anymore

You know you like it when I treat you bad

Shes a good girl
If you let her be
Make you feel like a girl

Once you get in gear
Stop playing games
You gotta feel good

Fugazi,"Why can't I walk down a street free of suggestion?
Is my body the only trait in the eye's of men?
I've got some skin
You want to look in there?

Lays no reward in what you discover

Suffer your words, suffer your eyes, suffer your hands
Suffer your interpretation of what it is to be a man

He only wants to observe it

We sit back like they taught us
We keep quiet like they taught us
He just wants to prove she does nothing to remove it
We don't want anyone to mind us

So, we play the roles that they assigned us
She does nothing to conceal it
He touches her 'cause he wants to feel it
We blame her for being there

But how are you gonna tell the real I bust from these fo' knees 
Cause he sees everyone with a deal with a record company 
They go home, they write a rhyme, they think they ready to battle better 
Some write forward, some write backward

With a verse that's worse than the last one 
Some say BOO! he's the po he used to diss Jamaicans 
And Hatians cause you thought I was American

I used to play hookie just to see how good an emcee was 
He said I bust a battle, alright, I still took a gun 
No cheeba, cheeba just a Libra on a last ride 
I waited so long that I thought I died and came back alive 
So hear the spirits, many fear, ?Sir New Stosser? 
This the new thing under the Sun, when I come, I come 
Bam-bam, alakazam, he grabbed the mic 
Up the block they ran, I came back with the bag 
Cause that's my momma man 
I'm just patrollin', move off in the block 
But the spot that I clock, you get shot if your numbers' about 
So don't get caught in the fast lane, the fast lane

So here's sut-um to take you from the am to the pm

Fugees,"Wait a second, draw back, ban this here I come
Stick this business, stock me up, they took me coat with a stun gun
On a Sunday, a bloody Sunday, so what's the resume?
Heads got felt in the force I heard a Milky Way
I caught a heart attack when I heard my cousin ?
In Avenue D. in Brooklyn New York City
Ever since I used my man I moved to Jersey
But realistically, God, could of called me early
'Cause I got a big bop I'm wanted by the block
I take a ruff-neck chicken make stop in stone top
'Cause I roll with the army of sixty-eight
The Privates' don't make the orders it's the General that makes the wig-wack
Buy her back, buy a cat, I got scratched in a day to kidnap
And at night I was back and the Jeep got attacked by a gang that sold crack
But the posse was strapped it was nothin' but crap!!
I got cuffed in the back, in the jail there were rats
So I pulled out my mack to get out of this crap
Though I wish I could zap outta here but I quack like a dog
That pass gats so I put the gas mask on the mic
There were blasts cause I do it it's my task
And all the jumper the guys that I see to me pass the class
Check out the vocab, it'll get out, then get it, do it again
Gift of the guy if you're good you're good, if you're bad you're bad

I want to know, how hard do you want to it? (Hard as it can get)

Hardcore (Hardcore), hardcore (Hardcore)
Yo, watch yourself for your health I'll snatch your last breath
Then I left you up for another one bites the dust
You couldn't ride me if you went behind the bush, gush
Leave the style alone, don't try to follow me
'Cause a life of the hood make it a little triggery
So keep your eyes on the prize, don't be surprised
'Cause on my half I may pull out a semi-automatic sixty-eight
Watch around my back it's mainly static
Droppin' emcees like a bad habit
Here come the Pras with a new package

Mad and they ignorance, think they can test the performance of an ancient (Rapper!)
Let me break it down in a dialect (Badder!)
Easier said than what the mono said
'Cause there's more than righter rapper, paid for the rapper be-bop
'Cause he said everybody's rappin', them and they momma
So when I grab the mic I grab it like a gangster
Microphone sniper 'cause it'll be the prowler

Launch it, it's trife, no magic, the realistic maggot
Don't leave the gadget or you'll be gat it
Simple, the riddle, who's the monkey in the middle
What's the goose, um!
So let me cut his neck loose yo
I keep it positive and not so negative
These is when you diss, emcees take it
So send it to they call the battle
I'ma raw I let it rappin' now I'm more
Your ball, you're waitin' for me to fall, but I won't

[Chorus]

I gotta jump on the A-Train, I saw cat with a scat he was blowin' like Coltrane
My boys' said give him a call, I gave him a dollar, he said are you a rapper?
Kids have a seat and don't miss a beat and listen to the battle of the saxin' in your emcee

Now Red Rock, call Red Rock, call Red Rock, call Red Rock, call Red Rock call
(It could mean rewind the gun-check me baby)

I rock and shock the dough is show squeeze and cheese and whether pleasin'

Yo check it out. 
This is the boy Wyclef from Translators, I'm coming from the
Booga Basement with a roots drink in my hands. 
So put the Rotts tonics in the air, 
yeah cause I'm-a start this one off like this. 
Cause niggas are living like there ain't no tomorrow. 
I nuked this on the S900 cause I couldn't fford a 1100. 
I'm-a start this one a little something like this. Here we go.
Hey yo people you're living like there ain't no tomorrow
You get caught in the terra asside em and ga morro
Father, forgive him for he know not what he done
When the bum search for drums, the son search for condoms
He seek no, with his ring but with his head
That leave many dead in hospital beds; now you and death are newlyweds
So before I enter the tunnel I step back and shake it
Is it world the death or better life in a casket
Destruction of the flesh, new reporter wasn't coming
The devil cursed him cause he couldn't follow 10 commandments

Living like there ain't no tomorrow
You're living like there ain't no tomorrow
You're living like there ain't no tomorrow
You open up your eyes and them was ga marrow. WOO!

You're living like there ain't no tomorrow
You're living like there ain't no tomorrow
Open up your eyes.

I called up the VP, she told me she was busy watching TV with Roxy
I told her I was coming, she said that ain't necessary
three's a crowd, so what's the philosophy?
Another girl trying to take my girl away from me, easy
Fuck the door, I jumped through the window
Somewhere over the rainbow
Paranable and the bitch still in my home
Stick stick in your socket, I sacrifice you like a live rabbit
Fatal attraction the coffin's the cabinet
Cause in the 90's girls got dicks
So keep the light on and make sure that the chick don't that back
She said that she did it with some girl named Lisa
I said what's the boot yo, she pulled the camcorder
Bust it, so what's the charge, you called me a womanizor?
I tried to say sorrym she said say sorry for Taquisha.
Chairs come flying my way like balls at basketball practice.
Call the priest cause she's turning to the exorcist
She kicked me out cause she was paying for the apartment
That's real, you got no girl, if you got no money to spend
But she had loved me for my mind and my poetic skills
But bow i'm checking magazings and getting cheap thrills
Asking myself when will it end?
Cause when it came to sex, my hand was my best friends

[Chorus]

I had a cousin like a brother
He tried to play me undercover
He said I didn't bang her
But the girl was his secret lover
But I played stupid like my brain had no minerals
It's so hard to say good-bye we singing at the funeral
Girls smash it up easy, when they know they got the bugsy
He used to sleep alone, but now he's riding Mrs. Daisy
You say all my business my life's my life my knife's my knife
So I be the lion that guards the trife
But at the party, I still move my waistline
A girl approached me and asked me for the time
I said; no disrespect, but check the watch on your wrist
And if you're looking for a hit check Charles Bronson from Death Wish
Then All of a sudden her man pushed me from the back
I turned out real cool- I said why did you do that?
The name is Clef, Clef bon
Then mark my word that I'm-a break your fucking arm
Unless you apologize and pick on someone your size
Not too cookoo-hit you-but the 4 to the 5
Point it to your nose
Now your blood turns to snow.

You want to battle swing?  I bring commanding men, like I was king.
In all your dreams I write the horror flick of Stephen King.
Cling to false, also those papers say ock.
I got tired of the fat lady so I sing to my own opera.
Ba-lang-balang-balang-to-de-man-de-rock-'cause I love thee.
If you live by the sword, you will be die by the gun,
'Cause all guys tell lies, and more girls commits it.
I was ordered to code red, but now I'm chillin' with a few good men.
Assassination on the kid from the capitol.
I never play the soap opera, but now I'm a general hospital.
Condition critical, spirit over who's the physical.
So if I die, catch me at the funeral.
I'll fly away, oh glory,
With a mic in my hand, to a land where only God knows me,
And the angels write raps on holy paper.
I said: I'm lookin for Jesus, he said: take the escalator
One flight up, is guaranteed you'll be there.
My sister'd be there, my mother'd be there.
So, Mona Lisa, could I get a date on Friday?

I don't puff blunts, so I always got my breath.
Never had to battle with a bullet proof vest.
They call me cock-weasel, but I still cave a chest.
I don't wear Jheri curls, 'cause I'm nah from the West.
No disrespect to the West, true indeed,
I rock it to the East, the East is the seed.
To see that them days back, yo sheepskins and hot tracks.
Peace to Mr. Magic, things are getting tragic.
Now we on some new stuff, I never feared the Ku Kluk.
My own clan is actin' up, I blame it on the Phillie blunt.
Whatcha gonna do, kids are acting oooohhhh.
Hill is gettin' fed up, yo, where's the coporate at?
A mister three-piece-suit.
Check the square roots, Girbauds and Timberland boots.
Nah, that's the serpents, and know them garment tips.
I got a head full of problems and a hand full of nappy roots.
I feel a Jones' comin' down, yo I

A rid-dang-de-dang, the nappy head bang.)
No I, got the slang to make the chitty-bang-bang

Hey, yo, a battle is a battle but a battle's not a battle.
If it's snake doesn't rattle,
'Cause my style's as old as a reptile.
As slick as a new Nile, as new as a new child.
So come follow me to the land of Abraham.
This land's your land, this land's my land.
The blacker the black man, the better the next man.

I feel injection,
Put the needle to your skin, feel reality's heroin.
You maintain to put a negro in pain, you used to diss me.
""Oh, you want to hang with old Eddie Kane?"" (The Five Heartbeats.)
Ain't nuttin' wrong, snap your head to the song.
Word is bond, you get wrong, I'll have you sing like Louis Armstrong.
And I say to myself, what a wonderful world,
But what the hell was so wonderful 'bout cotton in the farm?
Mr. Slave Man!
The harder they come, the harder they fall, so come one, come all.
Don't stall or I'm a stick you like a voodoo doll.
Doors locked, stop drawer for the count, who drops.
You slept on a kid from the boondocks,
Out of Motorville land of the ill kill.
Bellsburg Viking, so you know I'm top ranking, Phil.

Now and, forever's, them emperors, are nova
The loving, the hugging, will never be over

[Pras]
Back up back up boy, don't get me started
Still the MC, hit the target, you get bombarded yeah
Affect the minds, let the blind evaporate
Let me elaborate, oh no (it's too late)
Push the button, cause I'ma get ?
Pass me a SCUD missile, so I can bomb the land

[Wyclef]
Yo Pras (what?) Yo Pras (what?) Some start to wonder
Some see lightning, some hear thunder
Shades of a black man, maybe the black panther
Making MC's run when it come to rapping I'm the Darth Vader
I'm not regular, consider me irregular
From the regular rapper ones that lumber
But I come from a slum where many bum
Sometimes I cooled out, while my boys were in prison
I always told them that right, overrules wrong
Cause ever since a boy mama told me judgment they will come son
So I watch what I do, what I say, how I PLAY
And hope that I make it through the next day
Cause the streets are like a jungle, they got me say
Cause Tarzan's a black man
So I'm waiting for a break in the record company
So I could take you MC's, back to camp I mean
Cause with a flick of my wrist, I come rewind another rhyme
I got more rhymes than a church got wines 
Ever since middle school, I used to, rule
The ? mule, people called my talent beautiful
Never lost a battle, they thought I was buck wild
?
They didn't know that a ReFugee could rock so well
So here's the resurrection, of Pras, Wyclef, and L

Check me or my team as I recharge your body [Repeat: x4]

[Pras]
Living to be given, chilling like Bob Dylan
Like Michael I'm Thrilling, I'm not dealing to be illing
Running a mask ?, like the task force
The cause is laws, the laws that broke your jaw
Now I'm, getting raw on a thing like a mean machine
(Why you running around with the same old thing?
You know what I mean, yeah)
I search and search, I start to faint
But never never never fall in entertain
Don't beam me up Scotty, I'm Audi like John Gotti
Driving in black Caddy

[Lauryn Hill]
Success for the next man is success for myself
Vanity's vanity yet I still wanted wealth
I know there's a true God, but it still makes me think
Of Yusef, now is the notty dread dead?
Believe in the Bible because it promise eternity
Six six six, that makes you, my adversary
So I, watch my back and hopin I don't get taxed
I used to, rip the rapper cause they said we'd been said wack
I know what the critics they say, keep it commercial
I used to freestyle, but everything now is rehearsal
I miss the old school, so tell me what will I do?
I guess I'll start a revolution with the Translator Crew, so

Check me or my team as I recharge your body [Repeat: x8]

They label me (What?) the MC psycho
Prim' you up, but don't mistake me for Sunoco
Cuss to get loose, now you got the micro' Joe
Who talking about hope? Poquito dinero
Means I work hard, but got no money, and that ain't funny
Hey honey when you work for free see it's hard to get a lady baby
But they say good things come to those wait
So I wait, no ego trip, and on the mic I penetrate
Elevate as I battle for high stakes
Many gamble, I eat you like an animal
Cause he gambled for the dime that he didn't have
He woke up in a dream and found his body in a body bag
Wyclef pissed cause, oh what I really said is
Is I'm that funky, big up def in pig Latin man, 
A lot of rappers try to out rap, but miss me yo
But I'm asking every teachers everything he know
There's always one trick, to make em slip
So let me predict in pure trick I'm sure the rap form will recharge

Fugees

(Intro: Wyclef Jean)
Yo', check it out, I want all the refugees out there
To just put up your motherfuckin' hands, you know you're a fuckin' immigrant
Put up your hands youknowhatI'msayin'?
I'ma start this shit off like this, this time around

(Chorus: Wyclef Jean)
H-to-the-A-to-the-I-to-the-T-to-the-I
Live or die, it's nothin' but a dark side
Fugees on the mic, yeah, yeah
Yo', refugees on the mic, oh yeah, oh yeah
H-to-the-A-to-the-I-to-the-T-to-the-I
Live or die, it's nothin' but a dark side
Fugees on the mic, yeah, yeah
Yo', refugees on the mic, oh yeah, oh yeah

(Wyclef Jean)
If you wanna snap (SNAP), if you wanna crack (CRACK)
If you wanna shoot, give me a second so I can lay flat
Cause this, some the cemetery's, the reality
Where the tough guys get buried in their property
Word to Sampson, the tone will get you hung
I had a friend, they murdered his father and his three-year-old son
I heard him cursin' the essence of the, the (PAUSE) committed the crime
But ah, murder got no time
The country has no law, it's either rich or poor
I'm out the back door, I got nuttin' to fight for
I'm sailin' on a boat like a goat - I clear my throat
When I got to Brooklyn, I was broke, so I selled coke
I look in through microscope, for my country and the hurt
My eyes bleed, I see Aaron Steed, the Haitian Pope
Figure or Dundee, the-riginal Malcom X
Swing like the ki's, so should I put on David Tomerfest
Though I'm humberlicious strugglin' to jump
Let me blow her upper-her bubble in your face - that'cha ego!
Aiyyo, freeze-funk, you got to stay stable
Watch out for the devil, he comes after you after the revival
When will he come, what will he do, what will he say?
That's all a mystery, but have your hand grenade
So you can blow the motherfucker away
Beep, beep, I gotta make a sale so I can eat
So Praswell, grab the mic and be complete

(Pras)
Huh, lovin' the wreck in effect, will be all in checkmate
Another style for Praswell to translate
For those who can't relate to stay down my - no-man wait
No mistake, when I tell you, your prophet is a fake

(Wyclef Jean)
You said a contract on a Haitian, three-hundred g's
Your sharpshooters are lousy, we mend to-high-be-high hoodies
So show your face-a when you waste, I know who's smokin'
The bigger that you try to put out yours just makes me Mr. Nobody
Take high wit'cha just right, it'll be like Michael get ordered, a viper you know!!
Yeah, a viper cause you might lose a life to the side by like
What did I have to in the line of the barkin' of the bright side
You tried to scare me but I won't mover-a
The bully of the block becomes the hour of the glock
So cuckoo!! The sounds I run are rollin' with the bodyguard
But don't forget the day it's sunny but it'll be foggy

And in the funeral, you'll be singin' a new tune
May your soul rest on the moon (?Jack in wood spoon!!?)
In Channel Seven, you said: ""Death before Cut""
You killed so many that your conscience ended up - whattup? (WHAT!!)
Aiyyo black men, you're dyin' by a dozen cousin
So all I do is walk away yo' Prince as if nothin' happened
You call me a punk, I gotta step cause all you did was flex
But don't get closer cause the kid still gotta keep his rep
See I'm known for the crew like the jewel was the jewel
Like the follow got the boo, like the miller got the boo
Let the fool cop the man-jewel, suck up, up the ?cool-lew?
Oh why you got the ha-ha-lew-lew?
I got the rap loose, so sci-bi-dee-bob-bob, you don't stop
You do the rap-rap, from hip-hop to be-bop, from be-bop
To beep-beep, the Haitian kid, beeper's goin' off beep-beep
I gotta make a sale so I can eat, beep, beep
The Haitian kid, beeper's goin' off, you know I got no time to sleep, so beep-beep

(Chorus: Wyclef Jean)
H-to-the-A-to-the-I-to-the-T-to-the-I
Live or die, it's nothin' but a dark side
Fugees on the mic, YEAH!!
Yo', refugees on the mic, oh yeah, oh yeah

(Pras)
Man, I went to cops the other day to plead for my innocence
They brought me in another charges of a legal residents
And L-E-N, on a foreign land, a ????
Watch me go back to my land and then there will be a thing
Gorillas in the mist, where everything, and the light becomes a priest
They put up they guard, they pump up they fists
Now I'm number one on they motherfuckin' hit-list...
Goin' down for first degree of manslaughter
Makin' change out of emcee's makin' them outta quarters
That's they value, that's what they worth
Cause the first shall be last and the last shall be first, yeah
What we learned was to burn, now cause you see-came
With that machette, it's your turn
It's not funny, but twenty a month is what you earn baby
(We on to the Yankee, pass the mic to the ""Yankee"")

(Lauryn Hill)
Well I'm as cool to ya the mic I'm checkin' comin' from my temple
With a message, to deliver, but the back is very simple
I'm the girl ""Yankee"" rollin' wit' the kids from Haiti
Coolin' as a mighty grab who gets the last laugh hahaha...
You bite size with my Haitian from they stinks as my ""Yankee""
Wonderin' who was the first to pull over girl as soon as it came out son
My history - a hypocrite, so what we gonna do?
The dope is dope is only get the man since that is true
So hip-hip with my lip as I rip with a felt tip
With a righteous situation, interpretation, a graduation
Your ventilation, and education, segregation, emancipation
A capitalization, it's agration, not separation, ya breath the Haitians...

H-to-the-A-to-the-I-to-the-T-to-the-I...



",Refugees on the Mic,1994
Fugees,"Check the crippled man, sitting in the church
My conscience hurts, flesh like me hits the dirt
She's paralyzed from her feet to her thighs
 
And the man who pulled the trigger didn't even lose his necktie
Hi, I check Jimmy cutting hair at the barbershop
He plays the bass guitar, like David plays the harp
His knowledge name is Greek, cause whenever he speaks

He's got the wisdom of King Solomon bags in his eyes from no sleep
Sometimes he thought of the fame in Madison Square Garden
So some seek stardom, but they forget Harlem
But seeking first of all the kingdom of God is what my pops told me

So if I fall, could the choir catch me
I flew away, on a mountain, got tempted by Satan
Got bitten by a cobra, but the Lord took my venom
So who's side am I on? I'm on the righteous
Always check the lyrics, no time to contradict

[Chorus]
Some seek stardom, then they forget Harlem [Repeat: x3]
They, brothers, sisters, families, people, we, brothers
Keep their pockets full, but their souls run empty

Well aiyyo family I beseech you, in the hopes that I may reach you
My mother taught me one day that this mid-day would come someday
Born to talk that jive, with peaky hair grown wild
And teachers disliked me, cause I knew where my culture be

So now yeah mom I read history, I can't neglect my passion see
Rock it's kind of new to me, cause my true love was poetry
White was good and bad was black but black was just a massa lackey
Built for that B. Nimble Jack and I'd like to save you from the wicked

D-Dog clear I wouldn't be wet
The black to mourn, tomorrow's death
The evil things, glad that I, while angels wrote this violence why?
Help me make me comprehend my black berserk and why cast it

Time to blaze the angels nappy heads are braided that you make me
See what's hard for me that don't make you flee
When I enter your vicinity, you see my God ain't never after me
So yo I be wised up with Greek

To go and be, the last and good and see what's wrong with me
And through your insecurity of me and my ability
So bredren won't you let me be or has thou asked to much from thy
To tell the truth and not to lie? Oh my

[Chorus: x2]

But as I grew, I knew cause the master told me
From a baby to a woman from a woman to a baby
Life is so short, hardcore becomes hard-corpse
Step in a coffin where the money's no longer the source

There we go, there we go, there we go
I got mine now won't you get yours, we never open doors
So we neglect, and don't protect the ones that's not
People never really seem to care

And then they cry out, ""My people! Why aren't we treated equal?""
As we flee, we flee our own communities
We leave our family in poverty
And then we blame it on another, so family please recover

Oh see'mon please come now with you can come with me now and blow now
If you want to, we're through

[Chorus: x4]",Some Seek Stardom,1994
Fugees,"Delivered straight from the temple
Hip hop ya don't stop
One o'clock, two o'clock, three o'clock, rock!
Well as an infant I was born into religion,

My mother called me Baptist
But what she forgot to mention
Was what Baptist meant.
The story goes God sent his only begotten son

To make sure that I would have one.
As I learned in Sunday school,
He's... to disrespect my mother and father would be taboo.
But as I grew I met a Jew, a Catholic and a Protestant

And couldn't figure out where Baptist fit.
Hastily got crazy that ya made me see
Brother has confronted me with such ambiguity.
Are you Jehovah, Buddha, or shall I call you Allah?

All the words for Heavenly Father.
I just like to be a scholar on the subject called theology,
So that's how mi figure,
While they call themselves Christians, usedÃ¢??a call me nigga.

And... black hole leaves no control over thought.
I leave my body to see where the pits
Go high when the physical takes control.
No communications with the inner self

The prize is the otherwise wise, who has spiritual health.
Got to explain, they had the problems visions of gettin' along with herself,
Cheap on the corner, cornered herself and becomes a mourner.
Logic, brothers -

Ah, yo sista, can Prazwel and Wyclef get some - check it out.
Delivered straight from the temple,
Hip hop ya don't stop
One o'clock, two o'clock, three o'clock, rock!

Delivered straight from the temple,
I had no time to sample,
My cousin's name was Samuel,
I wasn't allowed to use the turntables,

My dad was a preacher so rap music was your devilism,
And if the wordsÃ¢??d say ""Thank you, Lord"",
I couldn't listen.
So I used to sneak to listen to DJ Red Alert,

To check the competition.
And DJ Red Alert goes berserk,
'Cause as a young lad I had a big rap pad,
'Cause he who waited to practice would someday be the greatest guy.

So I checked them as they flippin' 
Sometimes their padsÃ¢??re not slippin'
They think they rippin' rappin'
The only 'rappin' they doing is in the room before they packin'.

You gained the world, sucker
But you lost your soul.
The devil brought you us, all you do is sell a foe.
Life after death could be eternal fire,

So some get blunted but you're back on earth when it's all over. 
Mama said that blunt was a stun to the brain 
So some say, ""I don't smoke"",
But on a [unknown] he sniff coke 

He won the lotto - now he dies of an overdose 
While the bum he picked a hole to sleep, he wanted a deep throat. 
So ask yourself the question Ã¢??Who's really maxin'?Ã¢??, 
'Cause some check in but don't check out and need a Hell or Heaven high 

But to some Earth is Hell, in Heaven's death 
So they pretend to be Hades and kill till there's nothin' left Ã¢?? ha. 
But I might hit Ã¢??em with a gun that's harder than all guns 
My check from the temple - check the text 

(It's got the news to get wreck) 
Can I get a witness? Check the text. 
Get wrecked. Check the text, check the text 
(It's got the new [unknown] to get wreck), can I get a witness? 

(Check the text), here we go yo 
Well I arrive let me tell you what I see in my third eye.
Many die they call a battle, they got crucified.
Justice is righteous in the eyes of the beholder, 

While the younger the better,
But the older the wiser 
Mama used to read in deep from the Book of Proverbs
But the bird said the word was absurd, have ya heard? 

Knowledge - I come to teach 
While I increase ya decrease 
Some say peace, but on a street a .45's my piece 
Hallelujah, hallelujah, praise be to thee Jah Ã¢?Â¦.

Come
On the nineteentheth of October I remember 
Startin' my life on as a natural lever 
'Cause I lick one-two-three/four-five-six/seven shots 

While any priest here builds his church on a solid rock.
Hit me! 
So feel the spirit comin' from the Heaven above.
(Hey, Pras, how could you be a hood and full of so much love?) 

I said, ""In every man's chest there beats a heart 
Hip-hop's where it starts, I tried to master the art.
Come on!""",Temple,1994

Stop the violence and just bring it on, wild 

Hey yo I, feel kind of melancholy people think they really know me 
I keep a wrap about me while I'm driving daddy's Audi 
I pay the toll fighting for my own soul 
Cause the bourgeois type of mental sucks like a flat comb 
But I be baiting the rebel base to bass distort the EQ 
The devil's wishing they could send me back to Mogadishu 
Cause I've been wild since I was a juvenile 
Afro-centric profile, back when righteous rap was your style 
Now kids are whyling so I ask the bad black 
Boogie bandit, what's the damage, gimme the estimate then 
Pray tell me when's the revolution will begin? 
I turn on my TV I check out Farrakhan on CNN see

Way back when before guns became gats and

C.O.P. has an APB out on Chewbacca

Yesterday in Central Park they got the Jogger
Okay, okay
Let's get the confusion straight in ghetto Gotham
The man behind the mask you thought was Batman is Bill Clinton
Who soon retire, the roof is on fire
Connie Chung brung the bomb as it comes from Oklahoma
Things are getting serious, Kuumbaya
On a mountain Satan offered me, Manhattan help me Jah Jah
You can't search me without probable cause
Or that proper ammunition they call reasonable suspicion
Listen I bring friction to your whole jurisdiction
You planted seeds in my seat when I wasn't lookin
Now you ask me for my license registration
""WHERE THE FUCK"" do I work
""WHAT THE FUCK"" is my occupation
Well I'm an MC, I'm down with the Fugees
Mother Mary caught a flashback like Rodney now the cops got Lolly

The subconscious psychology that you use against me
If I lose control will send me to the penitentiary
Such as Alcatraz, or shot up like al Hajj Malik Shabazz
High class get bypassed while my ass gets harassed
And the fuzz treat bruh's like they manhood never was
And if you too powerful, you get bugged like Peter Tosh and Marley was
And my word does nothing against the feds
So my eyes stay red as I chase crazy bald heads, word up!

Warn the town the beast is loose

The chase is on I feel like the bad guy
Fifth gear 125 like New Jersey drive
Looked in my rear view mirror
Police was getting closer
Heard a roar in the sky
Looked up and saw the Blue Thunder
My inner conscious says throw your handkerchief and surrender
But to who
The star spangled banner ooh
Say can't you see cops more crooked than we
By the dawn's early night robbin' niggas for keys
Easy low key crooked military
Pay taxes out my ass but they still harass me

The streets of corruption got me bustin and cussin' in the Concrete Jungle
Thoughts being dribbled like that tall kid Mutumbo
Handled by Hannibal
Suitable to be a fugitive like Dr. Kimble
(Ay yo should I slow down?)

(From newark to Ontario), bust us when we in stereo
Cause me and rashida rock the battles
It's apparent, your no talent, cause your blazin' in your saddle
Watch these rap bitches get all up in your pockets
Then bounce with accountants that give me good stock tips
Cause props is up, digga's through the roof
Burnin' niggas like I'm 90 proof
And for all you head beaters
The lead eaters, the cheaters soon to be retreaters
While mamasitas carry real heaters
I rock the dooby and
L rocks the Nubian twists 96
Motherfuckers gettin' dissed

Everyone wants to be a cowboy
Grab your guns boy
Forty-five by my side, do he live
No the nigga dies

Yeah, when the out's hooked up with the refugees
It be more niggas than the NAACP
Comin' up on weed of all type
Smokin' home-grown out tobacco pipes
(You've got to know when to hold them
Know when to fold them)
I can take the sunshine, piss in your wine
Steal your concubine, walk away with your goldmine
So oh ah achiga, mamase mamasa mamakusa
Fuck the sheriff, I shot john Wayne
Push him off the runaway train in the movie shane
Yeah me and that kid, um ""what's his name?""
That would be me, young zee from no brain
Smokin' pure from the health fodd store
While my whore slaps cops like zsa zsa gabor
Fuck with out's it's like those Islam brothers
We march through your hood with a million motherfuckers
So let's get high off the fu-gee-la
When the east is in the house, like I'm blahzay-blah

When pandemonium strikes, at midnight
Full moon splits soft niggas in a lunatic
On some absurd shit
You talk back, hustlin' crack don't make you bigger
Niggas who take your measurements quick, don't make it quicker
Stick and slide with vigor
City streets hot like liquor
21 gun saluting, shootin' niggas from the roof and
Got nerve to mouth about it and the weight you claim you movin'
Your whole style is loose and we goin' sew it like it's cotton
You fail to recognize that everybody could get gotten
The bounty on your head, says your dead by manana
Pop babies whisperin' that there's a body dropped, behind the lot
Police blew up the spot and locked the whole block
Medina is the east side of town lounge never till we yawnin'
Gun players regular front page is the bonus
Life will keep existing while I'm shitin' on the corners
Life will keep existing while I'm shitin' on the corners

Everyone wants to be a cowboy
Grab your guns boy
Forty-five by my side, do he live
No the nigga dies",Cowboys,1996
Fugees,"Where I was born, nothing is promised
My life is filled with less hope than the prophecies of Nostradamus
Omega marks the ending of predictability, birth of agility
Who will it be to test me and expose their futility
Iron like a lion from Zion stop tryin' so hard
I think I smell your brain cells fryin'
The family's behind you if you're worthy
Philosophies developed deep in the back streets of dirty Jersey
Troops with scully hats and Timberland boots
No more break-dancing for loot
Niggas hustle and shoot
In the Garden State, it grows stink weeds and criminals
Government funds are minimal
Oppression's subliminal

These days its hard for we to find peace of mind
Between insanity and sanity there lies a thin line
Some dwell in hotels with Jezebels
A stone age and fall a victim to the Plague
Unclean bad dreams of Wyclef being a fiend
One last kiss from my sweet serpentine
Eliminate then break
Navigate to rejuvenate thoughts of suicide with my nickel plate
Reconciliation came from my enemy-friend
Who said family don't bend
We stay silent till the end
Now who would think that your best friend
Would be your worst enemy and your enemy your best friend
Stare into the air inspiration from the atmosphere
I think of old ghosts, that ain't even here
Like Alex Haley take notes on this Biography
My family tree consists of street refugees
A ghetto land, where we talk slang
Stolen cars bang, like my chitty bang-bang sh-bang
For the heads, we ain't sellin' cocaine today
So refrain and let my family reign okay

Just walkin' the streets death can take you away
It's never guaranteed that you'll see the next day
At night the evil armies of Shaton don't play
So defend the family that's the code to obey

But if I fall asleep and death takes me away
Don't be surprised son, I wasn't put here to stay
At night the evil armies of Shaton don't play
So the family sticks together and we never betray

Nah fuck that
Fifty-two pick up, no cops around
Fifty-two thousand in cash, I don't want no savings bonds
Have the money ready, I smell something fishy
Your wife's in my custody
One false move and you'll find her body in the sea
That's the voice of the kid, that's the kidnapper
I do my work and then I catch my ticket to Jamaica
Meet me in the alley, make sure you bring the money
This ain't the seventies I'm far from a jive turkey

My circle it can't be broken
Open, cut-throatin', provokin'
Record promotin, tokens chokin' on they words like smoke and
Cause we soft spoken, doesn't mean that we've forgotten
Your bootie smells rotten and one day you will be gotten
See joker's is scatter-brained, their focus is unrestrained
My army is trained, you never find us beefin' in vain
Cause I've seen fire and I've seen rain
You claim fame, while modest niggas remain
I can judge a character like Ito judge a verdict
And if you bringin' threats I give you sex if I ain't heard it
See poppin' shit's about your attitude and how you word it
I've seen the biggest niggas on the block get murdered
And they deserved it
Or so the beast said when they served it
That shit is nervous
So what's my purpose?
Family, we must preserve it
Your number's retired
I hope you like the hell fires
You'll be screamin' Murder she Wrote like Chaka Demus and Pliars

Just walkin' the streets death can take you away
It's never guaranteed that you'll see the next day
At night the evil armies of Shaton don't play
So defend the family that's the code to obey

But if I fall asleep and death takes me away
Don't be surprised son, I wasn't put here to stay
At night the evil armies of Shaton don't play
So the family sticks together and we never betray

We used to jump rope
But now we gun hope
Bustin' shots off of project roof tops
Sending signals with the blunt smoke
Ock, don't talk a lot if you can't hold it in lock
If you think lips sink ships
Imagine full glock clips
I hold a glass of Remy Martin
Gettin' milks by the carton
Extortin' the light weights for thinkin' they important
The night pays and heavenly ways
Ain't nothin' free ah
Knowledge of your family and steppin' to your B.I.
You see I, stay on top of shit like a fly
My niggas reach when they got beef
Then jet down to South Beach
Yo mouthpiece is yappin'
I hear it in your rap and
My family is thick so that bullshit could never happen

Just walkin' the streets death can take you away
It's never guaranteed that you'll see the next day
At night the evil armies of Shaton don't play
So defend the family that's the code to obey

If I fall asleep and death takes me away
Don't be surprised son, I wasn't put here to stay
At night the evil armies of Shaton don't play

How many mic's do we rip on the daily
Say me say Many moni, Say me say many, many, many

I get mad frustrated when I rhyme
Thinking of all them kids who try to do this
For all the wrong reasons
Seasons change, mad things rearrange
But it all stays the same like the love doctor Strange
I'm tame like the rapper,
Get red like a snapper when they do that
Got your whole block saying ""True dat""
If only they knew that,
It was you who was irregular,
Sold your soul for some secular
Muzak that's wack,
Plus you use that loop over and over
Claiming that you got a new style
Your attempts are futile, ooh child
Your puerile,
Brain waves are sterile
You can't create, you just wait to take, my tape's
Laced with malice
Hands get calloused
From grippin' microphones from here to Dallas
Go ask Alice if you don't believe me,

See me, ascend from the chalice like the weed be
Indeed be like Khalil Muhammad
MC's make me vomit
I get controversial

Oh, contraire mon frere
don't you even go there
Me without a mic is like a beat without a snare
I dare to tear into your ego,
We go, way back like some ganja and pelequo

Now I take iron, makes my shit constipated
I'm more concentrated.
So on my day off,
With David Sonnenberg I play golf
Run through Crown Heights screaming out Mazel Tov
Problem with no man
Before black, I'm first human
Appetite to write like Frederick douglass with a slave hand
Street pressure word to poppa, I ain't goin' under
One day I'll have a label and make deals with Tommy Motolla
Momma always told me ""You're one in a million""
Always watch your back, never tangle with Haitian Sicilians
Now I got a record deal, ""How does it feel?""
I'm never gonna survive unless I get crazy like Seal.
Cause the whole world's out of order
So at night the fiend's dance on Grease with John Travolta
One got slaughtered as he coughed blood from his mouth
The other tried to duck and caught a left with my Guinness Stout

And my panache will mosh your entourage
Squash your squad and hide your body under my garage.
And when the cops come lookin'
I'll be bookin' to Brooklyn
Leave the trails broken flippin' tokens to Hoboken
A clean getaway like Alec Baldwin
Drivin' in my fast car playin' Tracy Chapman

Fugees,"I woke up this morning
I was feeling kind of high
It was me, Jesus Christ and Haile Selassie
Selassie said greetings in the name of the most high,
Jah rhastafari,
Christ, took a sip of the amaretto,
Passed it down the table said today I'll be betrayed by one you 12
Disciples
Give me a clue who could do this to you?
The kid on the block who makes less money than you.
Crooked cops pulled up, they offered him 30 pieces of silver
All he got to do is deliver the savior
Right on bergen st. from bad luck to good luck
My cup runneth over, pass it down, guzzle up
The time has arrived, the prophecy will manifest
I saw death, I got scared, butterflies on my chest
Father if possible, pass this cup before me,
But it's too late I chose my destiny in gethsemane.

You see I loved hard once, but the love wasn't returned
I found out the man I'd die for, he wasn't even concerned
And time it turned,
He tried to burn me like a perm
Though my eyes saw the deception, my heart wouldn't let me learn
From um, some, dumb woman, was I,
And every time he'd lie, he would cry and inside I'd die.
My heart must have died a thousand deaths
Compared myself to Toni Braxton thought I'd never catch my breath
Nothing left, he stole the heart beating from my chest
I tried to call the cops, that type of thief you can't arrest
Pain suppressed, will lead to cardiac arrest
Diamonds deserve diamonds, but he convinced me I was worth less
When my peoples would protest,
I told them mind their business, cause my shit was complex
More than just the sex
I was blessed, but couldn't feel it like when I was caressed
I'd spend nights clutching my breasts overwhelmed by god's test
I was god's best contemplating death with a Gillette
But no man is ever worth the paradise manifest

Gun-clap shell cap,
Got them crawling on they back
Come through with the fu
They be who the fuck is that
It's unpredictable, when my tongue performs like jujitsu
Cut you with my lyrics, stab you with my pencil
Lethal injection, witness protection
Refugee camp's under investigation
Gunshot bursts in all directions
For the wack mc's we read your revelations
Discharge through your pores
Get raw and kill boors
I can capleton when I'm on a tour

I used to work at Burger King. A king taking orders
Punching my clock. Now I'm wanted by the manager

I backed up off him then caught him with five finger to his face
I had to put him in his place
This kids invading my space
But then I recognized the smile, but I couldn't place the style
So many fronts in his mouth, I thought he was the Golden Child
Then it hit me that's Tariq from off the street around my Grams
I haven't seeen him since fifteen, when he got booked for doing scams
I tried to walk away but he wouldn't let me leave
He ran up quick behind me asking, ""Yo what happened to my nigga Steve?""
Steve was like this kid I went with back in Grammar School
I chuckled knucklehead I seen him yesterday he's cool
He's busted, ""so who you checking for now?""

I walk the street and camouflage my identity
My posse in the Bronx wear the mask
My crew on the Isle wear the mask
Stick up kids rollin' in the Omni wear the mask
Yeah everbody wear the mask but how long will it last?

3 A.M. in the morning on the Boulevard
I'm still at large engaged with my entourage
Me and Godfather and a 67 Dodge
I stepped out the note to post up my guard
Searching for my car that was stolen from Scotland Yard
My first instinct was to check the chop shop garage
As I rung the bell someone tapped me on my back
I turned around to look it was a rookie in a mask
He said, ""I got a itchin' on my trigger
Don't move nigga I'm taking you for murder.""
See cops got two faces like two laces on my Reeboks
My knees knock as I step back for a clearer shot
Well did you shoot him? Naw kid I didn't have the balls
That's when I realized I'm pumpin' too much Biggie Smalls

M to the A to the S to the K
Put the mask pon me face just to make the next day
Brothers be beefin', cops be thiefin'
Brothers be schemin', and should be teamin'
Jokers be smokin', and staying broke n
Bitches be teasin', and money skeezin'
Niggas be creapin', baby mothers be weepin'
I walk the streets and camouflage my identity
My posse in the Haiti wear the mask
My crew in Jamaica wear the mask
Stick up kids bumping Fugee-La wear the mask
Yeah everybody wear the mask but how long will it last?",The Mask,1996

Gonna find you and take it slowly
Ready or not, here I come, you can't hide
Gonna find you and make you want me

Now that I escape, sleepwalker awake
Those who could relate know the world ain't cake
Jail bars ain't golden gates
Those who fake, they break
When they meet their 400-pound mate
If I could rule the world
Everyone would have a gun in the ghetto of course
When giddyuping on their horse
I kick a rhyme drinking moonshine
I pour a sip on the concrete, for the deceased
But no don't weep, Wyclef's in a state of sleep
Thinking bout the robbery that I did last week
Money in the bag, banker looked like a drag
I want to play with pelicans from here to Baghdad
Gun blast, think fast, I think I'm hit
My girl pinched my hips to see if I still exist
I think not, I'll send a letter to my friends
A Born Again hooligan only to be king again

Ready or not, here I come, you can't hide
Gonna find you and take it slowly
Ready or not, here I come, you can't hide
Gonna find you and make you want me

I play my enemies like a game of chess, where I rest
No stress, if you don't smoke sess, lest
I must confess, my destiny's manifest
In some Goretex and sweats I make treks like I'm homeless
Rap orgies with Porgy and Bess
Capture your bounty like Elliot Ness, yes
Bless you if you represent the Fu
But I'll hex you with some witch's brew
If you're doo-doo, voodoo
I can do what you do, easy, believe me
Fronting niggas give me hee-bee-gee-bees
So while you're imitating Al Capone, I'll be Nina Simone

The Buffalo Soldier, dreadlock Rasta
On the twelfth hour, fly by in my bomber

Dance around the border like I'm Cassius Clay",Ready or Not,1996
Fugees,"Look into the rhyme
Rum to the ripple
Single
But at times I come in triple
Blaow, blaow put the heater to your head
Now your dead
Wyclef don't give a *beep* if you're dead
Raaaaah, raaaah
Let me attack just like the black cat
You in the wrong neighborhood, check the map
Hooo, you've got to go for backup
To do what you gotta do
So you'll be back with France CU
Traitor in your crew is mafo heat
Put the poison in your tea
And kill the toad, But I'll be back with the centipede
I'm on some new technique, drunken bamboo
Awoo hoo a hoo, I'm taking all crews what
Competition, stimulation for the rap man
Losers check your tooters
While I'm suckin' on your girls hooters
Don't play macho, while you got the gun
Cause if you got to reload
Wyclef the multi-talented
Average heads can't handle it
I'll bring it to you live
Only if you want it
Me and my guitar go back like the days of the R MC's
The W-Y-C-L-E-F, Wyclef
Through any contest
I'm victorious
Still keep it real, if you will and manifest
Through your skills, not by how many shells you peel

I'm a bring down the ruckus
Play the nutcracker
Rough-neck rednecks make me no bother
Time after time, ask Cyndi Lauper
Boss, you don't want to fuckk with my partners
Motion, commotion, what's your proposal
Uphold two-fold, the crew is disposal
Like utensil, false idental
I autograph my lyrics with a number 2 pencil

I'm the L, Won't you pull it
Straight to the head
With the speed of a bullet
Cuttin' jokers off at the meeky-freeky gullet
Lyrical sedative, keep niggas medative
Head rushers I give to creative kids and fiends
Dreams of euphoria
Aurora
To another galaxy
Phallic-sy
Be this microphone, but get lifted
Lyrically I'm gifted
Burn on in without the roach clip (it)
Henders, mind-bender
Pleasure sender
So frequently your nerve endings belong to me
Wrongfully you put me down not receiving the full capacity of my smoke
Wack niggas choke
From the fumes that I emote
Or emit shit
See even I feel the mahogany L
Natural hallucinogen
Turning boys to men again
With estrogen dreams
Release blues, yellows and greens
From Brownsville to Queens

I creep like a theif, no doubt the man's swift
I'm more magnificent than Lee Van Cleef
You stand stiff and got the nerve to let your man riff
And start flakin' like dandruff
C'mon son my steelo's tight
Cause by far I'm the best producer on the mic
Born to write, analytical conceptions
With precision and leave lyrical incisions",The Score,1996
Fugees,"Another MC lose his life tonight, Lord
I beg that you pray to Jesus Christ, why
Oh Lord, father don't let him bury me, whoa

I haunt MCs like Mephistopheles, bringing swords of Damocles
Secret service keep a close watch as if my name was Kennedy
Abstract raps simple with a street format
Gaze into the sky and measure planets by parallax
Check out the retrograde motion, kill the notion
Of biting and recycling and calling it your own creation
I feel like Rockwell, somebody's watching me
I got no privacy whether on land or at sea
And for you biting zealots, your raps are cacophonic
Hypocrite, critic, but deep inside you wish you had the pop hit
It hurts don't it, a refugee come to your turf
And take over the earth

See my rhymes, are the type of fly rhymes
That can only get down with my crew
And if you try, to take lines or bite rhymes
We'll show you how the refugees do

Yeah, yeah behold, as my odes, manifold on your rhymes
Two MCs can't occupy the same space at the same time
It's against the laws of physics
So weep as your sweet dreams break up like Eurythmics
Rap rejects my tape deck, ejects projectile
Whether Jew or gentile, I rank top percentile
Many styles, more powerful than gamma rays
My grammar pays, like Carlos Santana plays ""Black Magic Woman""
So while you fuming, I'm consuming mango juice under Polaris
You just embarrassed cause it's your last tango in Paris

And even after all my logic and my theory
I add a ""Motherfucker"" so you ignant niggas hear me
Crew remember take notes, as I sow my rap oats
And for you biting zealots, here's a quote

Another MC lose his life tonight, Lord
I beg that you pray to Jesus Christ, why
Oh Lord, father don't let him bury me, whoa

You can try but you can't divide the tribe
These cats can't rap, mister author I feel no Vibe
The magazine says the girl should have went solo
The guys should stop rapping - vanish like Menudo
Took it to the heart, but every actor plays his part
As long as someone was listening, I knew it was a start
For me to get my chance, grab my pen and revamp
Do a cameo while everybody do the dance
Quick now, cause you running out of luck-a
Playing Mr. Big, I'm gonna get you sucka
While you munching at your luncheon
I'll be planning your assassination, then hit you like the Dutchman

I compress sound sets with my rap DBX
Then drop vocals on my 456 Ampex
Bring terror to the shop of horror
As she cry, ""mi amor,"" the phantom dies in the opera
And to the younguns who carry gadgets
And kill six days a week, then rest on the Sabbath
Violence ain't necessary, unless you provoke me
Then get buried like the great Mussolini
And for you biting zealots, your rap styles are relics
No matter who you damage, you're still a false prophet",Zealots,1996
Fugees,"(Come on)
Root to the fruit
More bass than Bootsy Collins
You verses me
Thats like Ali verses Foreman (a-ha)
God's act, stand back and watch
Devil's time out
Can't be timed with no swatch watch
Who I am, the black Abraham
Zunga zunga zang, yellow man, Vietnam
Add an extra bar as I spar with literature
Taking kingdoms from tsars
Winning more wars than the Moors

Hey, what's the deal?
I seen the Devil spar with Allah
Mathematics was the key to set my whole race free
You might debate we, a refugee
No harm hurt me
Dying, thirsty from the struggle
To my own hustle bubble
On the low, woe is me
To show the Free Bob right
The righteous Asiatic thinker
While Satan rob light
Civilised like the Molly
Burgundy, wildy rocking
Seen the fifth when Ali clocked him
John Forte will keep you locked in

People all around
You got to recognise and witness
The Mister who swift enough to knock you out with Mic fitness
Hands blistered from holding the mics tight
Some say it's fright night
Well throw the R after the F 'Cause I'm gonna take away your breath
The bell rings and now it's just a daily operation
Yo, you saw my lubrication
You can see this occupation (The winner)
Eh, you know we're from Q-Borough
L-Booie and Clef the trainers, Prazwell promote the throw

We used to bite bullets with the pig-skin casing
Now we perfect slang like a gang of street masons (uh)
Scribe check make connects
True pyramid architects (yeah)
Replace the last name with the X (X)
The man's got a God complex
But take the text and change the picture
Watch Muhammad play the messenger like Holy Muslim scriptures
Take orders from only God
Only war when it's Jihad
See Ali appears in Zaire to reconnect 400 years
But we the people dark but equal give love to such things
To the man who made the fam' remember when we were kings

Blocks on fire (Block's on fire tonight)
Fiends getting higher (uh-huh)
Robbing blue collar
(Hey yo we rob them blue collars)
Killing for a dollar (Stick 'em up)
Youths get tired (Ali ah yeah)
We're dealing with them liars (Ali ah yeah)
(We're dealing with too many liars)
From Brooklyn to Zaire (uh-huh ah yeah)
We need a ghetto Messiah (ah yeah come on)

Send me an angel in the morning, baby
Send me an angel in the morning, darling
Send me Muhammad in the morning, baby
Send me an angel in the morning, darling

Once the pen hits the pad it's danger
To this I be no stranger
Step inside the ring and I'll derange you (Come on)
I'm hearing no comments
Everyone looks dispondent
Dejected, rejected similiar to Liston
Catching lists
Beat it, sonny
My man is still the greatest in this
To hell with Frazier yappin' about that negative shit
Now listen, you can try and escape if you want to
But ask yourself, who the hell you gonna run to
Like Sade Abu you got a punch that I can sleep to
Fugees, Tribe, Busta Rhymes forever coming through

We sing Amazing Grace over two dollar plate
One roll snake eyes like Jake The Snake
Many lies put up for stakes
Wash our sins at the Great Lakes
You and I cannot see eye to eye
So therefore we cannot relate
I'm here when I make myself crystal clear
You fled to Cape Fear when I laced you in Zaire
Tussle with a lasso in the Royal Rumble
Seperate boys from men in the concrete jungle

I remember when Cassius Clay flipped the script
Taking trips to Zimbabwe
Africans started calling the God Ali Bumbaye (so bwoy)
It be the God stricken, God nutrition, lightly stricken (ha)
Blow that make you feel like you was poison bitten
Ha yo I'm 'bout to blister you and your sister
Predicting every ass whipping before my fights my nigga
This be your last warning once you walk past the doorman
Ali and Foreman gonna lock ass until the morning
Marvellous finances provided by Joseph Mobutu
Special guests of honour like the Archbishop Desmond Tutu
We watched the Rumble In The Jungle
To see who be the targeted uncle to be the first to fall and fumble
Nuff blows they gettong thrown, like solid milestones
Internally shaking up niggas, imbalance your chromosones
With the force of a thousnad warriors
When I bust your ass identify me as the lord victorious

Blocks on fire (You're a star)

No stress, if you don't smoke sess, lest
I must confess, my destiny's manifest
In some Goretex and sweats I make treks like I'm homeless
Rap orgies with Porgy and Bess
Capture your bounty like Elliot Ness, yes
Bless you if you represent the Fu
But I'll hex you with some witch's brew
If you're doo-doo, voodoo
I can do what you do, easy, believe me
Fronting niggas give me hee-bee-gee-bees
So while you're imitating Al Capone, I'll be Nina Simone
And defecating on your microphone

Ready or not, here I come, you can't hide
Gonna find you and take it slowly

You can't run away
From these styles I got, oh baby, hey baby
Cause I got a lot, oh yeah
And anywhere you go
My whole crew's gonna know baby, hey baby
You can't hide from the block, oh no

Ready or not, refugees taking over
The Buffalo Soldier, dreadlock Rasta
On the twelfth hour, fly by in my bomber
Crews run for cover, now they're under pushing up flowers
Superfly true lies, do or die
Toss me high ? only puff la

Was like the kiss on the collarbone
Soft caress of happiness
The way you walk your style of dress
I wish I didn't get so weak
Ooo baby just to hear you speak
Makes me argue just to see
How much you're in love with me
See like a queen a queen upon her throne

It was the sweet sweet sweetest thing I know
It was the sweet sweet sweetest thing I know

I get mad when you walk away (don't walk away)
So I tell you leave, when I mean stay
Warm as the sun dipped in black
Fingertips on the small of my back
More valuable than all I own
Like your precious, precious, precious, precious dark skin tone

It was the sweet sweet sweetest thing I know
It was the sweet sweet sweetest thing I know

It was the, ah
I tried to explain
Ah, but baby, it's in vain

Speaking on my mother's phone
The touching makes me think I'm grown, (you ain't grown)
Sweet prince of the ghetto
Your kisses taste like amaretto
Intoxicating, oh, so intoxicating
How sad, how sad that all things come to an end
But then again, I'm, I'm not alone

Full stop, don't copy, just cop me properly
Everybody same policy, universal equality
Responsibility, polity, to survive economically
Some people do it comically, fruits of freedom, equality
Invest your money properly, people owe me apology
Intellectual property, stealing stolen commodity
Souls searching or controlling and robbery, cold lack of camaraderie
Clones, copycats bother me, mine, own, blind cats, follow me
Honesty, honesty, honestly, all these jokes are common-league

The opposite direction of the room, he pulled his gun and said
I'm doomed join the son of man in the tomb

I see the soldiers, comin' from out the shadows
Ready for battle, ain't trying to hear the baffled
Warriors lined up in full war gear
In it to win it if it goes on for years
Dedicated to the stable of the Assassins

Just lift your voice in praise

Can't find no peace nowhere around

I wonder if I take you home will you still make me love baby
(Home home, home home)
Because I need you tonight

And on the real side, if you love me (huhh)
You would wait

I wonder if I take you home, (home home, home home)
I wonder if I take you home

Your love is

I wonder if take you home, would you still make me love baby
Because I need you tonight
I wonder if take you home, would you still make me love baby
Because I need you tonight

I wonder, I wonder, I really really wonder (home home, home home)
Take me home
I wonder, I wonder, I really really wonder
Take me home

Your love is
No good!

Keep telling me lies & ur still not sure
-In my eyes, our relationship would be more clear
""No its just I feel that your rushing me""
""Ok, since you dont love me & dont want to be with me""
""No its not that its just that im afraid of getting hurt""
I dont know I just keep asking myself, should I really take you home?
What do you think?

Take me, take me
Take me home
Take me, take me
Take me home
Take me, take me
Take me home
Home home, home home

Home
Your down on your knees
Begging me please

Take me home
Take me home!

Will you still love me
If I take you home!
Will you still love me
If I take you home!",I Wonder If I Take You Home,1985
