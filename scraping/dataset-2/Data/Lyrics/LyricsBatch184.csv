E3,"Yeah
(I can feel your fire)
When you niggas feel cold and your flows ain't got it no more nigga?!
(I can feel your fire)
Yeah nigga, you know what it is nigga, Gilla House nigga
Yo check me out yo yo yo

Red gone wild, more stunts than a fog I
A buncha wild drunk niggas yellin' raw ha!!
While you tryna get your weight up, but we on fire
Gilla House don't die, leave da spot bone dry
I want it all, are and E-D-M-A
N, cock the semi
A little henny in me
It's like ya black hawk down
I blast like a skinny
Roll up ta the jam and party like little Penny
My watch ain't for showin' time, it's for show and tell
And I got it for sellin' dimes on A-O-L
I'm off the hook, lookin' young, you gray as hell
You off the hook cause punk you ain't pay your bills
Redman, a truth nigga, put my name on it
Gilla House, die harder than John McClane on it
I'm smokin' sour diesel, gettin' head on my couch
From a chick that resemble Rosie Perez in the mouth
Simon Says swallow it ma, (Knock) don't spit it out
Y'all got fat, I got a plan for y'all slimmin' down
I ain't playin' no games nigga, I'm a take it there
Break it there, Visine your block, till I make it clear, nigga?!

(I can feel your fire)
When you niggas gettin' cold and your flows ain't got it no more you like
(I can feel your fire)
Brick city on my back, Doc Grizzley on the track, have ya hood sayin'
(I can feel your fire)
East coast, west coast, down south, world wide, everybody like
(I can feel your fire)
Welcome me back like Carter, welcome back the father
Keep it gutta, your problems, Bitch!",Fire,2007
Ea,"[Chorus]
I don't want to go outside
I just want to be with you
I don't feel like takin' a ride
You know what I want to do
Girl you makin' me sweat
Come close
Let's see how far we can get
And I'll ease your pain
So let it rain
Let it rain
Let it rain

Let it rain 
Honey pop the umbrella
The heavster goes down smooth as ?
Fingers keep twiddlin'
But I'll keep drizzlin'
Play like a fiddle and 
Here to move a million plus
Cause when I'm damp i don't rust
Girls make a fuzz
For the lover they lust
Nature takin' it's course 
So precise
Provin' Heavy D can strike more than twice
Pronto
Snuggle
Better yet
Cuddle
Happy like a little kid 
Playin' in a puddle
Of H2O
A drip drop ?
So figure I'm somewhere
Makin' a rainbow shine
With an intend to broaden
The quiet storm
That lurks more often
So lay with the lover 
Snuggle up under the cover
And I'll ease your pain
So let it rain
Let it rain

[Chorus] 

Now we can go down stairs
Strike a match to the log
Let the fire place burn
Dim the lights till it's dawn
Don't worry honey
I'll take good care of ya
I know what I'm doing 
I get wrecked on a regular
Red light
Green light
One two three
Hey yo who's on the mic
Well it's me Heavy D.
And I become somewhat of a national figure
You see some are big but the heavster is bigger
And I like candy bars with nuts
And ippy dippy girls
With prodigious butts
So lay with the lover
Snuggle up under the cover
And I'll ease your pain
So let it rain
Let it rain

[Chorus

Okey Dokey
Lookin' for a trophy
Giggolo, Romeo
Wrong category
More the dawn one type
Smooth like preacher
Your high school teacher
Just call me your daddy O
Loungin' on the padio
Actin' like a kid 
But drive a jeep 
not a caddy though
Pardon me Miss
In your high heel steps
Come inside the crib set
Before you get wet
Now just for prop
Let's keep this official
Heavy is the name
D is the initial
I love the way you strut in that suit from France
There's a party tonight
Would you like to dance
You're rollin' with the lover
So be sure you dress clever
I pick you up at eight
And my drops off whatever
All of a sudden  
I got the tingle fro a Twinkie
Fever, flavor for a Pringle
I think I like to mingle 
With somebody thick
Someone that I can cling to
A milk chocolate beauty
Someone that I can sing to
You got the makings of a rainy day girl to me
So come a little closer
Let's see 
how it would be

[Chorus]

Lightning and thunder
Kinda makes you wonder
Not too bad
For a brotha who's the son
Of a father who's a tech
And a mother who's a nurse
And I get paid 
'Cause I learned to kick a verse
I'm on a roll
I got 'nough control
Who needs a grammy 
When you know you got soul
I'm a smooth
Yella
Complexion
Vanilla
High Low
Aphro 
Intelligent fella
You look worried
Does something trouble ya
We can take a ride in my
Heavy D M W
But let's wait till the rain stops
So you can 
Gimme what you want 
And show me what you got
But for now 
Just snuggle me Snuggle me
Quit the chit chat
Double up and snuggle oven me
You got the makings of a rainy day girl to me
So come a little closer
Let's see how it would be",Let It Rain,1998
Ea,"How many times have you been pushed around 
Is anybody there, does anybody care 
And how many times have your friends let you down 
Is anybody there, did anybody stare, oh 
And how many times have your friends let you down 
Just open up your heart 
Just open up your mind 
And how many times has your faith slipped away 
Well is anybody safe, does anybody pray 

[Chorus]

Oh, life is waiting for you 
It's all messed up, but we're alive 
Oh, life is waiting for you 
It's all messed up, but we'll survive 

And how many days have you just slept away 
Is everybody high, is everyone afraid 
And how many times have you wished you were strong 
Have they ever seen your heart 
Have they ever seen your pain 

[Chorus]

She gets high, she gets lost 
She gets drowned by the cost 
Twice a day, every week, and all her life 
She gets high, she gets lost 
She gets drowned by the cost 
Twice a day, every week, and all her life 

[Chorus]

Oh, life is waiting for you 
It's all messed up but we're alive 
Oh, life is waiting for you, oh 
It's all messed up but we're alive 
It's all messed up but we'll survive 
It's all messed up but we're alive 
It's all messed up but we'll, but we'll survive",Life,1998
Ea$y Money,"I'm on my Stan Phil, little stubborn to say the least
Know I stand still, no budgin' and no crease
Know the plan still, it's turn 1 into 5
You literally see the double start to comin' alive
Come alive like heart rates, followed by a car chase
Chris Rock selfies with a top 5 arms race
Moncler skullies pulled over like cover ups
On the up and up, all the bottoms all Balmain
So even a robbery is expensive
Fly guy etiquette, my niggas get extensive
Abide by peddle, a homage from off the benches
And find mine buried in solemnly by the trenches
Bed-Stuy's version of Nas, no mirage
Freeze y'all on speed dials, the murder squads
From where the arms echo like they hear the falsetto
While I'm in here with a Mimi, forreal'll hold a rod
That's like 3 lines in one couplet
So that's 312 like I'm callin' Cabrini
Or 23 on the Ouija, predicted the rings
And bein' fitted for rings is the only thing we in touch with
Shit I'm just tryna fill a trophy room
I'm just tryna fill a trophy room
Until it's no mothafuckin' room left
Shit I'm just tryna fill a trophy room

Everything just feels so perfect
I'm on top of the world
Top of the world
On top of the world

Closet full of kicks, the lot is full of whips
Sippin' nothin' but the finest bottles of the Myx
Tryna see it all 'fore I lie up in a ditch
No takin' it with me, fuck depositing my chips
They bite a nigga's dick
Cause when I get bored I take a model for a trip
But go dine up in the Ritz
Why would I hide it if I'm rich? I'ma show off
Forreal, why you think Statik signed me to the clique?
Fuck you, pay me, least I said it to 'em nicely
Hate me, I reflect 'em, sendin' miss precisely
We put them grands in Jacksons to the safe
Cause of Washingtons, we spendin' them with wifey
Remember that? Thought you seen the end of that
But we carry tradition, what would be the sense in that?
Take though from Ea$y, might as well send it back
Got goons everywhere, where you gon' spend it at?
I'm done with the scramblin', pack handlin'
Shook the Ds like big titty bitch dancin'
If I get my chance in, I'm advancin'
For the clique, kill shit like Charles and get my mans in
You heard? But I'm just tryna fill the trophy room
Said I'm just tryna fill the trophy room
'Til I can't step foot up in that bitch, forreal
I'm just tryna fill the trophy room

Everything just feels so perfect
I'm on top of the world
Top of the world
On top of the world

This is beautiful, ain't it?
All these feelings of nostalgia ain't new to you, ain't it?
I did this shit already, my niggas, viewing is tainted
But watch I still kill it all through whatever arrangements
Got a shot, long range, Danny Ainge 'em
I can't blame 'em, I transport the message like Jason Statham
Sleep is minimal, perspiration, elevated
Rippin' shit easy like perforation
Soon they gon' hold for investigation
More soul than your grandma cookin'
I wonder, got 'em hooked like I know what you did
Last summer, it's a bummer tryna step to me
Bein' black right now, stressin' me
I'll shoot the sheriff and the deputy
Smokin' mad weed so this shit do not get the best of me
Stirrin' up your mental currents, word, I got the recipe
Herbs, you just speakin', man, I'm more show and prove
No jewelry, stack my gold in my trophy room

On top of the world
It's funny how things change
When you came from nothin'
Now the world knows your name
It feels so good to be livin' this life
Cause we worked so hard for what we want, right

Everything just feels so perfect
I'm on top of the world
Top of the world
On top of the world",The Trophy Room,2015

For us to turn its way instead

Have come to visit me so clear
Beyond the third dimension
Beyond what I can see
I cannot touch what touches me
Under my skin
The feelings begin
I know you're there, I sense you
The air is thick where it was thin
So I rebuke the darkness
And I lift up my fear
Believing they will disappear
Beyond the third dimension
Beyond what I can see
I cannot touch what touches me

There she stood in the doorway
I heard the mission bell

'This could be heaven or this could be Hell

Plenty of room at the Hotel California
Any time of year (any time of year) you can find it here

She got a lot of pretty, pretty boys, that she calls friends
How they dance in the courtyard, sweet summer sweat
Some dance to remember, some dance to forget

So I called up the Captain
'Please bring me my wine

And still those voices are calling from far away
Wake you up in the middle of the night

Down in the crowded bars out for a good time,
Can't wait to tell you all what it's like up there
And they called it paradise, I don't know why
Somebody laid the mountains low while the town got high

Then the chilly winds blew down across the desert
Through the canyons of the coast to the Malibu
Where the pretty people play hungry for power
To light their neon way and give them things to do

Some rich man came and raped the land, nobody caught 'em
Put up a bunch of ugly boxes and, Jesus, people bought 'em
And they called it paradise, the place to be,
They watched the hazy sun sinking in the sea

You can leave it all behind and sail to Lahaina
Just like the missionaries did so many years ago
They even brought a neon sign 'Jesus is Coming'
Brought the white man's burden down, brought the white man's reign

Who will provide the grand design, what is yours and what is mine?
'Cause there is no more new frontier, we have got to make it here
We satisfy our endless needs and justify our bloody deeds
In the name of destiny and in the name of God

And you can see them there on Sunday morning
Stand up and sing about what it's like up there
They called it paradise, I don't know why
You call some place paradise, kiss it goodbye",The Last Resort,1976

Southward as you go.
There is moonlight and moss in the trees
Down the Seven Bridges Road.

Now I have loved you like a baby
Like some lonesome child,
And I have loved you in a tame way,
And I have loved you wild.

Sometimes there's a part of me
Has to turn from here and go
Running like a child from these warm stars
Down the Seven Bridges Road.

There are stars in the southern sky.
And if ever you decide you should go,
There is a taste of time sweet and honey

Eagles,"Same dances in the same old shoes
Some habits that you just can't lose
There's no telling what a man might lose
After the thrill is gone

The flame rises but it soon descends
Empty pages and a frozen pen
You're not quite lovers and you're not quite friends
After the thrill is gone  oh
After the thrill is gone

What can you do when your dreams come true
And it's not quite like you planned?
What have you done to be losing the one
You held it so tight in your hand well

Time passes and you must move on,
Half the distance takes you twice as long
So you keep on singing for the sake of the song
After the thrill is gone

You're afraid you might fall out of fashion
And you're feeling cold and small
Any kind of love without passion
That ain't no kind of lovin' at all, well

Same dances in the same old shoes
You get too careful with the steps you choose
You don't care about winning but you don't want to lose

After the thrill is gone
After the thrill is gone, oh

The rain was softly falling
The tracks that ran down the boulevard
Had all been washed away

Out of the silver light the past came softly calling
And I remember the times we spent
Inside the Sad Cafe

Oh it seemed like a holy place
Protected by amazing grace
And we would sing right out loud
The things we could not say
We thought we could change this world
With words like ""love"" and ""freedom""
We were part of the lonely crowd
Inside the Sad Cafe

Oh, expecting to fly,
We would meet on that shore in the
Sweet by and by

Some of their dreams came true,
Some just passed away
And some of the stayed behind
Inside the Sad Cafe.

The clouds rolled in and hid that shore
Now that Glory Train, it don't stop here no more
Now I look at the years gone by,
And wonder at the powers that be.
I don't know why fortune smiles on some
And lets the rest go free

Maybe the time has drawn the faces I recall
But things in this life change very slowly,
If they ever change at all
There's no use in asking why,
It just turned out that way

You say he's a liar and he put out your fire,
How come you still got his gun in your hand?

You got your stories to tell.
Victim of love, it's such an easy part
And you know how to play it so well.

Dressed all in black
Went down to the station
And he never came back
They found his clothing
Scattered somewhere down the track
And he won't be down on Wall Street
in the morning

He had a home
The love of a girl
But men get lost sometimes
As years unfold
One day he crossed some line
And he was too much in this world
But I guess it doesn't matter anymore

Somebody's going to jail

You better hand on tooth and nail

When darkness falls early

To the ones they love
You better take a fool's advice
And tak care of your own
One day they're here;
Next day they're gone

I pulled my coat around my shoulders
And took a walk down through the park
The leaves were falling around me
The groaning city in the gathering dark
On some solitary rock
A desperate lover left his mark,
""Baby, I've changed. Please come back.""

What the head makes cloudy
The heart makes very clear
The days were so much brighter
In the time when she was here
But I know there's somebody somewhere
Make these dark clouds disappear
Until that day, I have to believe
I believe, I believe

Warm smell of colitas, rising up through the air
Up ahead in the distance, I saw a shimmering light
My head grew heavy and my sight grew dim
I had to stop for the night

There she stood in the doorway
I heard the mission bell
And I was thinking to myself
'This could be heaven or this could be Hell
Then she lit up a candle and she showed me the way
There were voices down the corridor
I thought I heard them say

Such a lovely place (such a lovely place)
Such a lovely face
Plenty of room at the Hotel California
Any time of year (any time of year) you can find it here

Her mind is Tiffany-twisted, she got the Mercedes bends
She got a lot of pretty, pretty boys, that she calls friends
How they dance in the courtyard, sweet summer sweat
Some dance to remember, some dance to forget

So I called up the Captain
'Please bring me my wine
He said, ""we haven't had that spirit here since nineteen sixty-nine
And still those voices are calling from far away
Wake you up in the middle of the night
Just to hear them say""

The pink champagne on ice

They stab it with their steely knives
But they just can't kill the beast

The highway is my legacy 
On the highway I will run 
In one hand I've a Bible 

In the other I've got a gun 
Well, don' you know me 
I'm the man who won 
Woman don't try to love me 

Don't try to understand 
A life upon the road is the life of an outlaw man 

First left my woman, it was down in Santa Fe 
Headed for Oklahoma, I was ridin' night and day 
All of my friends are strangers
They quickly come and go 

And all my love's in danger
'Cause I steal hearts and souls 
Woman, don't try to love me 
Don't try to understand a life upon the road is the life of an outlaw man 
Ooh

Woman, don't try to love me 
Don't try to understand 
A life upon the road is the life of an outlaw man

Some men call me Cain, 
Some men call me sinner, Lord 
Some men call me saint

Some men say there ain't

Then there's nothin' left to gain

And the bright lights have faded to blue
I was thinking 'bout a woman who might have loved me
I never knew
You know I've always been a dreamer
Spent my life runnin' 'round

And it's so hard to change
Can't seem to settle down
But the dreams I've seen lately keep on turning out
And burning out and turning out the same
So put me on a highway and show me a sign
And take it to the limit one more time
You can spend all your time making money
You can spend all your love making time
If it all fell to pieces tomorrow
Would you still be mine?
And when you're looking for your freedom
Nobody seems to care
And you can't find the door
Can't find it anywhere
When there's nothing to believe in still you're coming back
You're running back, you're coming back for more
So put me on a highway and show me a sign

That our short little memories
Never seem to learn
Lessons of history

We keep makin' the same mistakes
Over and over and over and over again
And then we wonder why
We're in the shape we're in

Good old boys down at the bar
Peanuts and politics
They think they know it all
They don't know much of nothing

Even if one of them was to read the newspaper
Cover to cover
That ain't what's going on

It's a frail grasp on the big picture
Dark ages

You’re my love drunk friend
All that red wine and candlelight
And soulful conversations
That go on until the dawn

How many times can you tell your story?
How many hangovers can you endure
Just to get some snuggling done?

You're living in a hollow dream
You don't have the slightest notion
What long term love is all about

All your romantic liaisons
Don't deal with eternal questions like
Who left the cap off the freaking toothpaste?
Whose turn to take the garbage out?

Frail grasp on the big picture
You keep on rubbin' that, you're gonna get a blister
It's a frail grasp on the big picture
I've seen it all before

And we pray to our Lord
Who we know is American
He reigns from on high
He speaks to us through middlemen

And He shepherds His flock
We sing out and we praise His name
He supports us in war
He presides over football games

And the right will prevail
All our troubles shall be resolved
We have faith in the Lord
Unless there's money or sex involved

Frail grasp on the big picture
Nobody's calling them for roughing up the pitcher
It's a frail grasp on the big picture
Heaven help us

Frail grasp on the big picture
All waiting for that miracle elixir
It’s a frail grasp on the big picture
I don't wonder anymore

Frail grasp on the big picture
Somebody says, ""You brought her here so go ahead and kiss her”

Asked if I came very far

Fuck all that, haters, just forget about 'em

Do your thing, don't care if you make 'em jealous
We're the kings, life is just our party palace

Eamon,"I got the first flight out when I finished up the tour, because I missed you
I even flew home a day too soon, all because I couldn't wait to kiss you
""Oh, how she will be loved""
Was the one thing stuck in my mind
And how tonight would be
Remembered for the rest of your life

I never thought that I'd do something like that
When I saw you two, it hit me like a heart attack
Oh no
How could you let somebody in through our door?
How could you bring him home?

I never thought I'd lose my temper like that
Now it's a fucked-up situation; he ain't coming back
Oh no
How could you please another man on our floor?
How could you bring him home?

I know you know I passed on every girl because I thought I really loved you
And you know that I'd never put anyone or anything above you
Because I loved you
And it was that love (It was that love)
That made me lose my head, and now it's too late
One day too soon
You'll regret it for the rest of your days

I never thought that I'd do something like that
When I saw you two, it hit me like a heart attack
Oh no
How could you let somebody in through our door?
How could you bring him home?

Hey
Oh
Hey

Please, God, forgive
Me for what I did
This day will stay for as long as I live
But if you walked in
And seen what I seen
I know any man would have done just the same

I know she gone, but I'm still holding on
Still smell the scent of her clothes, only God knows the pain
I cried til there's no tears left
Love my babies, we can't explain why she left
I'm all alone, feeling like my heart is blown
I do anything, just to see her come back home
But she chose not to hold on, and broke the bond
Left me with two babies like I'm Mr. Mom
But I'm handle what God gave me, cuz I'm a good man, and
Try to break me down, I'm strong and stay standing
Never imagine she gettin' down like that
Nine years in this together and you turning your back? Come on

Not saying I was perfect, babe, but I was willing to work it
I know the grass look greener, but you should of stayed beat
Let a good man go, so you can run free?
Could of held on, to these rough times, and made better ones
You left me when my music was down with no fun
Broke, I struggled so you made it through college
Cause I had street smarts, but you had knowledge
Longevity, suppose to be together forever
Now you say we growing apart? Whatever, whatever

Eamon,"Little ones listen, learn from me, see, you could be the best
But sit in your room depressed and you'll never progress
My sister Dee-Dee was born mentally retarded
She was a beautiful woman at 26, but now she's dearly departed
This May Tenth she suffered from a heart attack
The depletion of oxygen in the head left her in a coma braindead
Her internal organs was failing, her body no longer releasing excreations
My parents wouldn't pull the plug cause she was still breathing
Black, white, let's unite us, never divide us
X-Clan, Professor X died from spinal meningitis
So many like us are in Riker's suffering, struggling, slumming
A few years ago you was sucking your thumb
And now you're busting your gun
And dumbing, an innocent man is done
And enough of your bluffing, your thugging
And enough of the ruckus running, the roughest is coming
It's a miracle just being born
Learn to enjoy life, it ain't that long
Sing the words to my song, come on

Wake up, don't cry
So sad inside
I still get through the day
I'm gonna make it anyway
Wanna give up, feel like hiding
Yeah, I get down, but keep fighting
I still get through the day
I'm gonna make it anyway
Away, away
I still get through the day
I'm gonna make it anyway

Living ain’t a breeze, please, life’s full of tragedies
We see our friends die, some get murdered, some die by disease
Got your finger on the trigger, don't do it
Contemplating suicide, just put the gun down, we've all been through it
An infant in his crib sprayed by straight bullets and dies
He was a future genius, he would have won a Pulitzer prize
The racist cop shot an innocent black
An 8-year old prostitue hoing getting mommy money for crack
A little boy molested by his step-father, hopeless
The little boy grew up now, he's molesting his own kids
The government watching you from a satellite like you ain't had it right
Your best friend snitching on you, that's animal-like
It's horrible watching your loved ones die and having to bury them
To seeing my cousin found dead, she overdosed shooting heroin
My family dying from sickening disorders
We found my brother Maxx
He was blue and purple and he was stiff with rigamortis
My father got spots on his lungs, they think it's cancer
I'm praying every night, even if God don't ever answer
We can do it together, women hold your mans
Men hold your women, everybody let's hold hands and sing

Wake up, don't cry
So sad inside
I still get through the day
I'm gonna make it anyway
Wanna give up, feel like hiding
Yeah, I get down, but keep fighting

He is my light, my strength, my song

Firm through the fiercest drought and storm.
What heights of love, what depths of peace,
When fears are stilled, when strivings cease!
My comforter, my all in all
Here in the love of Christ I stand.

Fullness of God in helpless babe!

Scorned by the ones He came to save.
'Til on that cross as Jesus died,
The wrath of God was satisfied
For ev'ry sin on Him was laid
Here in the death of Christ I live.

There in the ground His body lay,
Light of the world by darkness slain
Then bursting forth in glorious day,
Up from the grave He rose again!
And as He stands in victory,
Sin's curse has lost its grip on me
For I am His and He is mine
Bought with the precious blood of Christ.

No guilt in life, no fear in death
This is the pow'r of Christ in me
From life's first cry to final breath,
Jesus commands my destiny.

Can ever pluck me from His hand

C'est à dire qu'il y avait tellement de l'ambiance à cette époque là
Et comme j'étais un beau garçon
Quand je vois que je fête mes 30 ans aujourd'hui alors que j'avais 18 ans hier
Les jours passent comme les voitures
La vie de l'homme ne dure pas longtemps
Quel est Le Bilan de ma vie, hein, hey?

C'est fou ce que le temps passe vite
Ah si, c'est ce que je me dis aussi quand j'vois le chemin qu'on a parcouru jusqu'aujourd'hui
Je repense à notre enfance pas toujours aisée
Sans trop dramatiser
Ce n'était pas toujours rose c'est peut-être ce qui nous a motivé
L'esprit était déjà Neg'Marrons petits vagabonds à têtes grainées
On préférait sécher les cours et rester s'vanner au quartier
L'excès de curiosité était tel
Qu'on s'enjaillait en suivant les aînés qui étaient pour nous des modèles
À l'époque dans les halls les gangs breakent, smurfent, parfois se rebellent
Fresh Boys, B-Boys représentaient Garges-Sarcelles
Je me rappelle y'avait des bandes et des gangs
Y'avait même des gang-bangs
C'est vrai qu'on bandait à peine mais on voulait déjà ken
Partager nos kiffs, nos ambitions, objectifs, ddevenir quelqu'un
Un point commun celui de réussir par tous les moyens
Maintenant j'comprends Ben-J que quand on était gamin
On avait le même itinéraire mais pas le même destin

Le temps passe et passe et passe et beaucoup de choses ont changé
Qui aurait pu s'imaginer que le temps se serait si vite écoulé
On fait le Bilan calmement en s'remémorant chaque instant
Parler des histoires d'avant comme si on avait 50 ans

On fait le Bilan calmement en s'remémorant chaque instant

Ben-J tu te souviens ce qui nous a donné l'envie d'écrire
L'oreille scotchée sur Nova à l'écoute des MCs qui déchirent
De là nos premières rimes naissent
Les jeux de mots, puis les jeux de scène
Ne cessent de s'enchaîner des MJC aux sound systems
Et puis en un éclair nous voici sous les projecteurs
On s'adapte et on domine, professionnel ou amateur
Tu le sais
C'est la monnaie qui dirige le monde, c'est la monnaie qui dirige la terre
Nous propulse aux sommets des hits de là tout s'est passé si vite
C'est boule de neige, premier album, studio, promo, clip vidéo
Les Neg'Marrons s'exportent en live et prennent tous les publics d'assaut
Dans les quatres coins de la France on est partis fout' le dawa
Comme dans les avant-premières de Steel Pulse et des Fugees à Ris-Pa
On a tout déchiré le 22 mai à l'Olympia
Pour baptiser le concert mythique avec tout le Secteur Ä
La musique m'a mis official qu'est-ce que j'aurais fait sans elle
J'ai esquivé les plans couchals aujourd'hui j'kiffe grâce à elle

Le temps passe tellement vite t'as vu comment on a changé
Ky-Ja t'as pris du poids, Ben-J toi t'as encore poussé
Regarde ça se passe tu brilles des pieds à la tête
Blanches baskets, de l'or aux poignets jusqu'aux lunettes Cartier
Pas plus que toi négro respect au Congo
Toutes les rates me parlent de toi et de Bisso Na Bisso
Merci mais dis-leur que je ne suis plus le même
Que depuis, j'ai un fils et aussi une femme qui m'aime
C'est ça, faut construire une famille assurer sa descendance
Même si ce n'est pas encore mon heure t'inquiète chaque jour j'y pense
L'horloge tourne, les jours défilent, les années passent, nos vies changent
On évolue chacun son destin mais surtout chacun sa chance

How we love to sleep
At the close of day
When the joys of the day fade away and the memories sweet
Of the day repeat 
In our dreams they creep
While we sleep, sleep, sleep
It seems that daytime was just made for laughter and song
Evening brings romance to lovers as they stroll along
Night time brings rest to the weary
Sooths all the hearts that are dreary
Leaves us alone with our day dreams
Brings back sweet golden love dreams while we sleep, sleep, sleep
How we love to sleep
At the close of day
When the joys of the day fade away and the memories sweet
Of the day repeat 
In our dreams they creep

I'm getting sentimental over you.

I thought I was happy,
I could live without love
Now I must admit,
Love is all I'm thinking of

Won't you please be kind,
And just make up your mind
That you'll be sweet & gentle,
Be gentle with me
Because I'm sentimental over you

How we love to sleep
At the close of day
When the joys of the day fade away and the memories sweet

While we sleep, sleep, sleep

Evening brings romance to lovers as they stroll along
Night time brings rest to the weary
Sooths all the hearts that are dreary
Leaves us alone with our day dreams
Brings back sweet golden love dreams while we sleep, sleep, sleep

When the joys of the day fade away and the memories sweet
Of the day repeat

A telephone that rings but who's to answer?

And candle lights on little corner tables

Silk stockings thrown aside dance invitations

Wild strawb'ries only seven francs a kilo

You'll remember yesterday
In its haunting strain
Vienna lives again

Of a half forgotten dream

Once again there comes to mind
Someone that you left behind
Love that somehow didn't last

That rapture so supreme

The Danube nights, the dancing lights again will shine

From Angels playing near the earth
To touch their harps of gold

From Heaven's all-gracious King

To hear the Angels sing

And I hear them singing
Sing, I do hear them singing

Was to certain poor shepherds in fields as they lay
In fields where they lay, they keeping their sheep

For they both have the very same sensation
When you're locked in the magic of a kiss

Beware my foolish heart

Like a friendly home the second time you call

There are those who'll bet  love comes but once, and yet

Now that she's out she rolls her way to the door

Earl Hargen Orchestra,"You must remember this
A kiss is still a kiss
A sigh is just a sigh
The fundamental things apply
As time goes by

And when two lovers woo
They still say, ""I love you""
On that you can rely
No matter what the future brings
As time goes by

Moonlight and love song's never out of date
Heart's full of passion, jealousy and hate
Woman needs man and man must have his mate
That no one can deny

It’s still the same old story
A fight for love and glory
A case of do or die
The world will always welcome lovers

What's that familiar strain that true blue note refrain
It's drivin' me insane,
Can't keep still, tho' it's against my will;
I'm on my P's and Q's I just can't refuse.

There goes that melody, it sounds so good to me,
And I am up a tree,
It's a shame, you don't know the name;
It's a brand new blues,

Just listen to that saxophone.
Gee, hear that clarinet and flute, 
Cornet jazzin' with a mute,
Makes me just throw myself away, 
When I hear 'em play.

You and the song are gone

We'll start in dancing ev'ry new dance again
Then it will be a pleasant novelty to tumble in just about ten.

Before each silvery star fades out of sight
Please give me one little kiss
Then let us whisper 'goodnight'

You'll learn to cook and to sew

When you're a stay-at-home , play-at-home

The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms

Some say it's honey and the bee,

What my love is to me.

I call my sugar ""Candy""
Because I'm sweet on ""Candy""
And ""Candy"" is sweet on me

He/She understands me,
My understanding ""Candy""
And ""Candy""'s always handy
When I need sympathy
I wish that there were four of him/her
So I could love much more of him/her

He/She has taken my complete heart,
Got a sweet tooth for my sweetheart

Its gonna be just dandy
The day I take my ""Candy""
And make him mine all mine

Earl Hines,"No use of talkin' no use of talkin'
You'll start in dog-walkin' no matter where.
There's jazz-copation blues modulation,
Just like a Haitian you'll rip and tear.
Most everybody likes the blues

Here's why I'm ravin', here's why I'm ravin'
If it's blues you are cravin' just come on down.
You'll hear 'em playin', you'll hear 'em playin'
Soon you'll be sayin', ""Hon jazz me 'round""
Because your feet they can't refuse.

What's that familiar strain that true blue note refrain
It's drivin' me insane,
Can't keep still, tho' it's against my will;
I'm on my P's and Q's I just can't refuse.

There goes that melody, it sounds so good to me,
And I am up a tree,
It's a shame, you don't know the name;
It's a brand new blues, 
The Royal Garden Blues.

Everybody grab somebody And start jazzing 'round

Hon don't you hear that trombone moan? 
Just listen to that saxophone.
Gee, hear that clarinet and flute, 
Cornet jazzin' with a mute,
Makes me just throw myself away, 
When I hear 'em play.

That weepin' melancholy strain, 
Say, but it's soothing to the brain;
Just wanna get right up and dance, 
Don't care I'll take most any chance;
No other blues I'd care to choose, 
But Royal Garden Blues.",Royal Garden Blues [Version 1],2004

We're gonna put away all of our tears,

This hill's to steep to climb,
And the days that remain ain't worth a dime.

Listen once again to the stale jokes,

May just be passing fancies and in time may go

There is someone I'm longing to see
Someone I simply can't help but adore
Someone who'll thrill me forever
Some day my prince will come
Some day I'll find my love
And how thrilling that moment will be
When the prince of my dreams comes to me
He'll whisper, I love you,
And steal a kiss or two
Though he's far away,
I'll find my love some day
Some day when my dreams come true
Some day I'll find my love
Someone to call my own
And I'll know her the moment we meet

You make me feel as though spring has sprung
And every time I see you grin
I'm such a happy in-div-dual

I wanna go play hide and seek
I wanna go and bounce the moon
Just like a toy balloon

You and I are just like a couple of tots 
Runnin' across the meadow 
Pickin' up lots of forget me nots

You make me feel so young 
You make me feel there are

I'm gonna feel the way I do today

When you have gone
Will color all my dreams
And light the dawn

I will be remembering

Earl Klugh,"Long ago a young man sits and plays his waiting game
But things are not the same it seems as in such tender dreams
Slowly passing sailing ships and Sunday afternoon
Like people on the moon I see are things not meant to be

Where do those golden rainbows end?
Why is this song so sad?
Dreaming the dreams I've dreamed my friend
Loving the love I love 

To love is just a word I've heard when things are being said
Stories my poor head has told me cannot stand the cold
And in between what might have been and what has come to pass
A misbegotten guess alas and bits of broken glass

Where do your golden rainbows end?
Why is this song I sing so sad?

Loving the love I love to love to love to love

Took me by surprise.

You witch, you witch,
One thing is for sure.
That stuff you pitch
Just hasn't got a cure.

We'll sigh goodbye to all we ever had
Alone where we have walked together

I'll be content you loved me once in April
Your lips were warm and love and spring were new
I'm not afraid of autumn and her sorrow
For I'll remember April and you

For flames live such a little while

What are you doing the rest of your life?
North and South and East and West of your life
I have only one request of your life
That you spend it all with me

All the seasons and the times of your days
All the nickels and the dimes of your days
Let the reasons and the rhymes of your days
All begin and end with me

I want to see your face in every kind of light
In the fields of dawn and the forests of the night
And when you stand before the candles on a cake
Oh, let me be the one to hear the silent wish you make

In the world of love that you keep in your eyes
I'll awaken what's asleep in your eyes

Summer, Winter, Spring, and Fall of my life
All I ever will recall of my life
Is all of my life with you

Have you anything to say to me?
Won't you tell me where my love can be?
Is there a meadow in the mist
Where someone's waiting to be kissed?

Skylark
Have you seen a valley green with spring?
Where my heart can go a journeying
Over the shadows and the rain
To a blossom covered lane

And in your lonely flight
Haven't you heard the music in the night?
Wonderful music, faint as a will o' the wisp
Crazy as a loon, sad as a gypsy serenading the moon

But my heart is riding on your wings
So if you see them anywhere
Won't you lead me there?

That you don't know what to do

When you up and take your love away
Say you feel the same way too and I wonder what
It is I feel for you

Could it be I'm falling in love (ooh)
Could it be I'm falling in love

When you need me I will be around
And darling you'll always be the only one for me

As I take your hand and lead you to the dance floor
As the music dies, something in your eyes

Guilty feet have got no rhythm

I know you're not a fool

And waste this chance that I've been given
So I'm never gonna dance again

Tonight the music seems so loud
I am wishing that we could lose this crowd
But maybe it's better this way
We hurt each other with the things we wanna say

We could have been so good together
We could have danced this dance forever
But no one's gonna dance with me

Take a sad song and make it better
Remember to let her into your heart

Hey Jude, don't be afraid
You were made to go out and get her
The minute you let her under your skin
Then you begin to make it better

And anytime you feel the pain, hey Jude, refrain
Don't carry the world upon your shoulders
For well you know that it's a fool who plays it cool
By making his world a little colder

Hey Jude, don't let me down
You have found her, now go and get her
Remember to let her into your heart
Then you can start to make it better

So let it out and let it in, hey Jude, begin
You're waiting for someone to perform with
And don't you know that it's just you, hey Jude, you'll do
The movement you need is on your shoulder

Hey Jude, don't make it bad
Take a sad song and make it better

Earl Scruggs,"Seems like only yesterday
I left my mind behind
Down in the gypsy cafe
With a friend of a friend of mine

She sat with a baby heavy on her knee
Yet spoke of life most free from slavery
With eyes that showed no trace of misery
A phrase in connection first with she occurred

That love is just a fou letter word

Outside a rambling store-front window
Cats meowed to the break of day
Me, I kept my mouth shut
To you I had no words to say

My experience was limited and underfed
You were talking while I hid
To the one who was the father of your kid
You probably didn't think I did, but I heard you say

That love is just a four letter word

I said goodbye unnoticed
Pushed forth into my own games
Drifting in and out of lifetimes
Unmentionable by name

Searching for my double, looking for
Complete evaporation to the core
Though I tried and failed at finding any door
I must have thought that there was nothing more absurd than

That love is just a four letter word

Though I never knew just what you meant
When you were speaking to your man
I can only think in terms of me
And now I understand

After waking enough times to think I see
The holy kiss that's supposed to last eternity
Blow up in smoke, its destiny, falls on strangers, travels free
Yes, I know now, traps are only set by me
And I do not really need to be assured

That love is just a four letter word

Strange it is to be beside you
Many years and tables turned
You'd probably not believe me
If I told you all I've learned

And it is very, very weird indeed yo hear words like forever plead
Those ships run through my mind, I cannot cheat
It's like looking in the teacher's face complete
I can say nothing to you but repeat what I heard

That love is just a four letter word

Just a little way's with me.
An' as we walked,
Then we would talk
All about our wedding day.

""Darlin', say that you'll be mine;
In our home we'll happy be,
Down beside where the waters flow,
On the banks of the Ohio.""

I led her down the banks of sand,
I plunged her in
Where she would drown,
An' watched her as she floated down.

Thinkin', Lord, what a deed I've done;
I'd killed the girl
I love, you see,
Because she would not marry me.

The sheriff walked right to my door;
He says, ""Young man,
Don't try to run.
You'll pay for this awful crime you've don.""

I've seen you make a look of love 
From just an icy stare 
Well, I've known you for a long time

I know Lord I've been blind 
To not have loved you more all this time 
But the image of you wasn't clear
I guess I've been standing too near

It's taken me a while 
But I have finally found 
What you are to me

With rock salt and nails.

So the next few lines come really hard
Don't have much but what I've got is yours
Except of course my steel guitar
Ha, 'cause I know you don't play
But I'll teach you one day
Because I love ya

I recall the night we knelt and prayed
Noticing your face was thin and pale
I found it hard to hide my tears
I felt ashamed I felt I'd let you down
No mandolin wind couldn't change a thing
Couldn't change a thing no, no

Could never, never change your mind

Oh no no no, oh no no no
And I don't know if I'm ever coming home

Take the last train to Clarksville,
And I'll meet you at the station,
You can be here by four-thirty,
'Cause I've made your reservation, don't be slow,
Oh, no, no, no,
Oh, no, no, no,
And I don't know if I'm ever coming home.
Take the last train to Clarksville,
Take the last train to Clarksville,
Take the last train to Clarksville,
Take the last train to Clarksville.",Last Train to Clarksville,1992
Earl Scruggs,"There's a dark and a troubled side of life
There's a bright and a sunny side too
Though we meet with the dark nest of strife
The sunny side we also may view

Keep on the sunny side
Always on the sunny side
Keep on the sunny side of life

It will help us every day
It will brighten all our way
If we keep on the sunny side of life

Though the storm and its fury breaks today
Crushing hopes that we cherish so dear
The clouds and storm will in time pass away
And the sun again will shine bright and clear

Let us treat with a song of hope each day
Though the moment be cloudy or clear
Let us trust in our Savior old ways
He will keep us everyone in His care

Keep on the sunny side
Always on the sunny side
Keep on the sunny side of life

It will help us every day
It will brighten all our way
If we keep on the sunny side of life
",Keep on the Sunny Side,1994
Earl Scruggs,"If I was on some foggy mountain top
I'd sail away to the west
I'd sail all around this whole wide world
To the girl, I love the best

If I had listened to what Mama said
I would not have been here today
A lyin' around this old jailhouse
Just weepin' my sweet life away

If I was on some foggy mountain top
I'd sail away to the west
I'd sail all around this whole wide world
To the girl, I love the best

She caused me to weep, she caused me to mourn
She caused me to leave my home
Oh, those lonesome pines and those good ol' times
I'm on my way back home

If I was on some foggy mountain top
I'd sail away to the west
I'd sail all around this whole wide world
To the girl, I love the best

",Roll in My Sweet Baby's Arms,1995
Earl Scruggs,"There's a happy childhood home in my memory I can see

Standing out upon the hill 'neath the shadow of the tree

If I only had my way it would give my heart a thrill

Just to simply wander back to the cabin on the hill.



Oh I want to wander back to the cabin on the hill

'Neath the shadow of the tree I would like to linger still

Just to be with those I love joy my heart would over fill

Just to simply wander back to the cabin on the hill



But the saddest of it all I can never more return

To that happy childhood home matters not how much I yearn

If I only had my way it would give my heart a thrill

Just to simply wander back to the cabin on the hill ",Cabin on the Hill,1996
Earl Scruggs,"Preachin', prayin', singin' everywhere
Shouting the praises of His loving care
All of God's children seem to gather there
Preachin', prayin', singin' down on the public square

I was a stranger there intent upon my way
But when I saw the crowd, I had the urge to stay
I heard a welcome voice biddin' me to come and share
Their preachin', prayin', singin' down on the public square

Preachin', prayin', singin' everywhere
Shouting the praises of His loving care
All of God's children seem to gather there
Preachin', prayin', singin' down on the public square

I felt so much at home amid the happy throng
That came from far and near to praise His name in song
To lay their burdens down, forget their every care
And have an old time meeting down on the public square

Preachin', prayin', singin' everywhere
Shouting the praises of His loving care
All of God's children seem to gather there
Preachin', prayin', singin' down on the public square

Now as I journey on, think back on the day
I am convinced within, these folks have found the way
To put their hearts in song, just pray an earnest prayer
And leave the door bells ringin' down on the public square

Preachin', prayin', singin' everywhere
Shouting the praises of His loving care
All of God's children seem to gather there
Preachin', prayin', singin' down on the public square
Preachin', prayin', singin' down on the public square

Earl Scruggs,"Soon the pines will be falling everywhere
Village children fight each other for a share
And the 6:09 goes roaring past the creek
Deacon Lee prepares his sermon for next week

I saw grandma yesterday down at the store
Well she's really going fine for eighty four
Well she asked me if sometime I'd fix her barn
Poor old girl she needs a hand to run the farm

And it's good old country comfort in my bones
Just the sweetest sound my ears have ever known
Just an old-fashioned feeling fully-grown
Country comfort's in a truck that's going home

Down at the well they've got a new machine
The foreman says it cuts man-power by fifteen
Yeah but that ain't natural well so old Clay would say
You see he's a horse-drawn man until his dying day

Now the old fat goose is flying cross the sticks
The hedgehog's done in clay between the bricks
And the rocking chair's creaking on the porch
Across the valley moves the herdsman with his torch",Country Comfort,1998
Earl Scruggs,"Hey, Porter
Hey Porter
Would you tell me the time?
How much longer will it be 
'Til we cross that Mason Dixon Line?
At daylight would you tell that engineer to slow it down
Or better still, just stop the train 
'Cause I want to look around

Hey, Porter
Hey, Porter 
What time did you say?
How much longer will it be 
'Til I can see the light of day?
When we hit Dixie will you tell that engineer to ring his bell
And ask everybody that ain't asleep to stand right up and yell

Hey, Porter
Hey, Porter
It's getting light outside
This old train is puffin' smoke and I have to strain my eyes
But ask that engineer if he will blow his whistle please
'Cause I smell frost on cotton leaves
And I feel that Southern breeze

Hey, Porter
Hey, Porter
Please get my bags for me
I need nobody to tell me now that we're in Tennessee
Go tell that engineer to make that lonesome whistle scream
We're not so far from home so take it easy on the steam

Hey, Porter 
Hey, Porter
Please open up the door
When they stop this train I'm gonna get off first 
'Cause I can't wait no more
Tell that engineer I say, 
Thanks a lot and I didn't mind the fare
I'm gonna set my feet on Southern soil 
And breathe that Southern air",Hey Porter,1999
Earl Scruggs,"They're gonna put me in the movies 
They're gonna make a big star out of me 
We'll make a film about a man that's sad and lonely 
And all I gotta do is act naturally 

[Chorus:]
Well, I'll bet you I'm a-gonna be a big star 
Might win an Oscar you can't never tell 
The movie's gonna make me a big star, 
'Cause I can play the part so well 

Well, I hope you come and see me in the movie 
Then I'll know that you will plainly see 
The biggest fool that's ever hit the big time 
And all I gotta do is act naturally 

We'll make a scene about a man that's sad and lonely 
Begging down upon his bended knee 
I'll play the part but I won't need rehearsing 
All I'll have to do is act naturally

Earl Scruggs,"Sometimes I feel like an innocent one
To deserve this fate what I have I ever done
I know that I made all the rules
But time can even change the hopeless ways of fools
I love you tonight like I did yesterday
I won't think of tomorrow or the price I pay
I drink from the well my soul is dry
I never know why

All I want is for your love to be all mine
But the angels won't have it
All I want is just a little peace of mind
But the angels won't have it
I thought I had a piece of my soul left to sell
I guess it's just as well
'Cause the angels won't have it

Who's looking after this see-through heart
Someone up there isn't doing their part
Oh Cupid you foolish boy
You should take better aim with your brand new toy
I love you tonight like I did yesterday
I don't think of tomorrow or the price I pay
I drink from the well my soul is dry
I never know why

All I want is for your love to be all mine
But the angels won't have it
All I want is just a little peace of mind
But the angels won't have it
I thought I had a piece of my soul left to sell
I guess it's just as well
'Cause the angels won't have it

So if I die before I wake
The innocent one whose heart could never break
Lift me up take me out of this bed
Watching the angels shake their heads
Don't feel sorry for me baby honey don't you cry
You can sell all of my clothes you will forget me by and by
I'll be riding that train I'll be singing that song
But I won't be gone for long
'Cause the angels won't have it

All I want is for your love to be all mine
But the angels won't have it
All I want is just a little peace of mind
But the angels won't have it

Earl Scruggs,"When I was young 
And in my prime (in my prime!),
I left my home in Caroline.
Now all I do is sit and pine, 
For all those folks I left behind.

I got the Blue Ridge mountain blues, 
And I sat right here to say,
""My grip is packed to travel, 
And I'm back to ramble,
To my Blue Ridge far away.""

I'm goin' to stay right by my Pa, 
I'm goin' to do right by my Ma,
I'll hang around the cabin door, 
No work or worry anymore.

I got the Blue Ridge mountain blues, 
Goin' to see my old oak tree,
Gonna hunt the possum 
Where the corn cob blossom,
In my Blue Ridge far away.
Woo!

I see a haze of snowy white, 
I see a window with light,
I seem to hear them both sigh, 
""Where is my wand'rin boy tonight?""

I got the Blue Ridge mountain blues, 
And I stay right here to say,
""Every day I'm countin' 
'Til I climb that mountain,
In my Blue Ridge far away.""",Blue Ridge Mountain Blues,2001
Earl Scruggs,"At every glance, you steal from me 
I catch your eyes still offering 
Ill-got desire bought with deceit 
'Cause borrowed love ain't never free 

I vainly swear in my starved mind 
To crave your look only one more time 
And pray not to reap what we might sow 
If borrowed love should start to grow 

Borrowed love, not yours for givin' 
Borrowed love, not mine to seek 
Borrowed love, this road we're takin' 
Toward one another's awful steep 

Forgiveness for what passion wreaks 
Bears a hurtful cost that don't come cheap 
Its wages paid with misery 
'Cause borrowed love ain't never free",Borrowed Love,2001
Earl Scruggs,"Mobil station where I stand
This old gas pump in my hand
My boss don't like me, got a face like a weasel
Oil on my hands and the smell of diesel
Here comes a big shot from the city
V8 engine, she runs so pretty
'Fill her up son, unleaded
I need a full tank of gas where I'm headed'
Up in the front seat a pretty red head
'We're going to Vegas we're gonna get wed'
'So fill her up son, don't be staring
That's a real diamond she be wearing'
I'm gonna take my baby one day
I'm gonna fill her up and head west
I'm going find some money all right
See those tail lights heading west
I got no money to invest
Got no prospects, no education
I was lucky getting a job at this gas station
That old cash box on the top shelf
The boss is sleeping, I'll just help myself
Let's consider this as just a loan
I can sort it out later on the phone
I'm gonna pick my girl up tonight
I'm gonna fill her up and head west
I'm gonna show her all the bright lights
We're gonna say we lived 'for we come home
And as I head through the woods on the way back
The evening sun is slanting through the pine trees real pretty
It's like I walked into a glade of heaven
And there's music playing
This money is cold in my hand
And a voice somewhere is saying
'Why would you wanna take that stolen thing
And what real happiness can it bring?'
You're gonna fill her up with sadness
You're gonna fill her up with shame
You're gonna fill her up with sorrow
Before she even takes your name
You're gonna fill her up with madness
You're gonna fill her up with blame
You're gonna live with no tomorrow
You're gonna fill her up with pain
You're gonna fill her up with darkness
You're gonna fill her up with night
You gotta fill her up with Jesus
You gotta fill her up with light
You gotta fill her up with spirit
You gotta fill her up with grace
You gotta fill her up with heaven
You got the rest of life to face
You gotta fill her up the right way
You gotta fill her up with care
You gotta fill her up with babies
You gotta fill her up and swear
You're gonna love that girl forever
You're gonna fill her up for life
You're gonna be a loving husband
She's gonna be your loving wife
You gotta fill her up with gladness
You gotta fill her up with joy
You gotta fill her up with love
You gotta fill her up with love
