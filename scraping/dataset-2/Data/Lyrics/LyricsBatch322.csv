Gordon MacRae,"The beggar man and his mighty king are only diff'rent in name,
For they are treated just the same by fate.
Today a smile and tomorrow tears,
We're never sure what's in store,
So learn your lesson before too late, so

Be like I, hold your head up high,
Till you find a bluebird of happiness.
You will find greater peace of mind
Knowing there's a bluebird of happiness.
And when he sings to you,
Though you're deep in blue,
You will see a ray of light creep through,
And so remember this, life is no abyss,
Somewhere there's a bluebird of happiness.

Life is sweet, tender and complete
When you find the bluebird of happiness.
You will find perfect peace of mind
When you find the bluebird of happiness.
Two hearts that beat as one,
'Neath a new found sun,
We are in a world that's just begun,
And you must sing his song, as you go along,
When you find the bluebird of happiness.",Bluebird of Happiness,2001
Gordon MacRae,"Dearie, do you remember when we

Waltzed to the Sousa band
My wasn't the music grand

Chowder parties down by the seashore
Every Fourth of July, test your memory
My Dearie

Do you recall when Henry Ford couldn't even fix
The running board under a Chandler six

Dearie, life was cheery
In the good old days gone by

Do you remember?

Uh huh!

Well if you remember

Wonderful!

Well Dearie, you're much older than I

What? Hey, wait a minute, Honey, I just got a long memory that's all.

Dearie, do you remember when we

Stayed up all night to get
Pittsburgh on a crystal set

Keystone movies, Coogan and Chaplin
Made you laugh and then cry

Test your memory, my Dearie
Do you recall when Orville Wright flew at Kittyhawk
But take it from me I would rather walk

Dearie, life was cheery
In the good old days gone by
Do you remember

Uh huh!

Well if you remember

Well?

Well, Dearie, you're much older than I

Ha Ha! I'll kill you

Dearie, do you remember how they

Loved Harry Lauder's act

My wasn't the Palace packed

Jenny Lind presented by Barnum
Sang her sweet lullaby
Test your memory my Dearie,

Chicago all in flames
Sure caused a terrific row

They blamed it on Mrs. O'Leary's cow

Dearie, life was cheery
In the good old days gone by
Do you remember? Well if you remember,
Well, Dearie, you're much older than,
Quite a bit older than,
You're older than I.",Dearie,2001
Gordon MacRae,"Strangers in the night, 
Exchanging glances
Wandering the night, 
What were the chances
We'd be sharing love
Before the night was through

Something in your eyes
Was so inviting
Something in your smile
Was so exciting
Something in my heart
Told me I must have you

Strangers in the night
Two lonely people
We were strangers in the night
Up to the moment 
When we said our first hello
Little did we know
Love was just a glance away
A warm embracing dance away

And ever since that night 
We've been together
Lovers at first sight
In love forever
It turned out so right

Strangers in the night
Two lonely people
We were strangers in the night
Up to the moment 
When we said our first hello
Little did we know
Love was just a glance away
A warm embracing dance away

Gordon MacRae,"Brand new state, Brand new state, gonna treat you great!
Gonna give you barley, carrots and pertaters,
Pasture fer the cattle, Spinach and Termayters!
Flowers on the prairie where the June bugs zoom,
Plen'y of air and plen'y of room,
Plen'y of room to swing a rope!
Plen'y of heart and plen'y of hope!
Oklahoma, where the wind comes sweepin' down the plain,
And the wavin' wheat can sure smell sweet
When the wind comes right behind the rain.
Oklahoma, ev'ry night my honey lamb and I
Sit alone and talk and watch a hawk makin' lazy circles in the sky.
We know we belong to the land
And the land we belong to is grand!
And when we say, yeeow-a-yip-i-o-ee ay!
We're only sayin' You're doin' fine, Oklahoma! Oklahoma, okay","Oklahoma (from ""Oklahoma!"") [From Oklahoma!]",2002

Gordon MacRae,"If, I expected love, when first we kissed, blame it on my youth
If only just for you, I did exist, blame it on my youth
I believed in everything
Like a child of three
You meant more than anything
You meant all the world to me

If, you were on my mind, all night and day, blame it on my youth
If, I forgot to eat, and sleep and pray, blame it on my youth
If I cried a little bit, when first I learned the truth
Don't blame it on my heart, blame it on my youth",Blame It on My Youth,2004

Cast two, me, you, sound of kisses floating on the breeze.

Gordon MacRae,"All our friends keep knocking at the door
They've asked me out a hundred times or more
But all I say is, ""Leave me in the gloom""
And here I stay within my lonely room
'Cause

I don't want to walk without you, Baby
Walk without my arm about you, Baby
I thought the day you left me behind
I'd take a stroll and get you right off my mind
But now I find that
I don't want to walk without the sunshine
Why'd you have to turn off all that sunshine?

Gordon MacRae,"Oh, there's a lull in my life 
It's just a void and empty space 
When you are not in my embrace
Oh, there's a lull In my life 
The moment that you go away 
There is no night, there is no day
The clock stops ticking
The world stops turning
Everything stops but the flame in my heart 
That keeps burning, burning

I know that you alone can end",There's a Lull in My Life [From Wake Up and Leave],2004

With love light and tenderness feeling 
They thrilled me through, they filled me too 
With wonderful dreams I am dreaming 
No need to speak, no more shall I seek 
For my heart has taught me their meaning 
And love has come, at last I know 
Your eyes have told me so 
No need to speak, no more shall I seek 
For my heart has taught me their meaning

Your eyes have told me so",Your Eyes Have Told Me So,2004
Gordon MacRae,"My heart is sad and lonely
For you I sigh, for you dear only
Why haven't you seen it
I'm all for you body and soul

I spend my days in longing
And wondering why it's me you're wronging
I tell you I mean it
I'm all for you body and soul

I can't believe it
It's hard to conceive it
That you'd turn away romance
Are you pretending
It looks like the ending
Unless I could have just one more chance to prove, dear

My life a wreck you're making
You know I'm yours for just the taking
I'd gladly surrender myself to you body and soul

Gordon MacRae,"Ol' man river
That ol' man river
He don't say nothing
But he must know something
Cause he just keeps rolling
He keeps rolling along
Rollin' along
He don't plant tators
He don't plant cotton
Them that plants 'em is soon forgotten
But ol' man river
He keeps rolling along
You and me
We sweat and strain
Body all aching
And wracked with pain
Tote that barge
Lift that bale
Get a little drunk
And you land in jail
I gets weary
Sick of trying
I'm tired of living
Feared of dying
But ol' man river
He's rolling along",Ol' Man River,2004

Where the mountains high
Seem to kiss the sky
Someone is out yonder, o'er the hills
Waiting patiently, Waiting just for me
 
Ramona, I hear the mission bells above
Ramona, they're ringing out our song of love
I press you, caress you, and bless the day you taught me to care
To always remember the rambling rose you wear in your hair
Ramona, when day is done you'll hear my call
Ramona, we'll meet beside the water fall
I dread the dawn when I awake to find you gone

Where we'll find a nook
To build our own love nest, o'er the hills

I feel my heart stand still
All I can hear you calling my name
Into a misty blue
I go in search of you 
There in the shadows calling your name
Why are you just beyond me
When will I see your face
Why do you just elude me
And leave me this lonely space

I can't forget your voice that calls my name

Gordon MacRae,"Last night when we were young
Love was a star, a song unsung
Life was so new, so real so right
Ages ago last night

Today the world is old
You flew away and time grew cold
Where is that star that shone so bright
Ages ago last night?

To think that spring had depended
On merely this: a look, a kiss
To think that something so splendid
Could slip away in one little daybreak

So now, let's reminisce
And recollect the sighs and the kisses
The arms that clung

When we were young last night",Last Night When We Were Young,2006
Gordon MacRae,"This is the only life for me - yeah
Surround myself around my own fantasy
You just gotta be strong and believe in yourself
Forget all the sadness 'cause love is all you need
Love is all you need

Do you know what it's like to be alone in this world
When you're down and out on your luck and you're a failure
Wake up screaming in the middle of the night
You think it's all been a waste of time
It's been a bad year
You start believing everything's gonna be alright
Next minute you're down and you're flat on your back
A brand new day is beginning
Get that sunny feeling and you're on your way (way)

Just believe - just keep passing the open windows
Just believe - just keep passing the open windows

Do you know how it feels when you don't have friend (friend)
Without a job and no money to spend
You're a stranger

All you think about is suicide
One of these days you're gonna lose the fight
You better keep out of danger - yeah
That same old feeling just keeps burning deep inside (inside)
You keep telling yourself it's gonna be the end
Oh - get yourself together
Things are looking better everyday (day)

Just believe - just keep passing the open windows

Gordon MacRae,"Many months have come and gone 
Since I wondered from my home
In the Oklahoma hills where I was born
Many page in life has turned
Many lessons I have learned
Yet I feel that in those hills I still belong

[Chorus]
Way down yonder in the Indian nation
I'd ride my pony on the reservation
In the Oklahoma hills where I was born
Way down yonder in the Indian nation
A cowboys life was my occupation
In the Oklahoma hills where I was born

As I'm standing here today 
I am many miles away
From the place I rode my pony through the draw
Where the oak and blackjack trees 
Kiss the playful prairie breeze
In the Oklahoma hills where I was born

Gordon MacRae,"Deep within my heart lies a melody,
A song of old San Antone.
Where in dreams I live with a memory,
Beneath the stars, all alone.

Well it was there I found, beside the Alamo,
Enchantments strange as the blue up above.
For that moonlit pass, that only he would know,
Still hears my broken song of love.

Moon in all your splendor, known only to my heart,
Call back my rose, rose of San Antone.
Lips so sweet and tender, like petals falling apart,
Speak once again of my love, my own.

Broken song, empty words I know,
Still live in my heart all alone.
For that moonlit pass by the Alamo,
And rose, my rose of San Antone.

Gordon MacRae,"I'm a roaming cowboy riding all day long,
Tumbleweeds around me sing their lonely song.
Nights underneath the prairie moon,
I ride along and sing this tune.

See them tumbling down
Pledging their love to the ground
Lonely but free I'll be found
Drifting along with the tumbling tumbleweeds.

Cares of the past are behind
Nowhere to go but I'll find
Just where the trail will wind
Drifting along with the tumbling tumbleweeds.

There's a picture of his woman in his locket.

Dumps the trash and sweeps the halls
And he makes sure
That stained glass shines

Picks up paper in the pews
And stacks the chairs in the choir room
But his real work don't start
Till quittin' time

When he goes through every prayer request
Lying on the pastor's desk
He hits his knees
And says God bless Miss Sommersby

Lord it's hard to live alone
And Marianna Thompson
Wants her daddy back at home
And Mr. Nelson needs forgiveness
Old Man Miller's crops need rain

While the whole town's fast asleep
He's hard at work
Pullin' that midnight shift
At the Maplewood Methodist Church

Every night's the same routine
And by the time he finally leaves
He's done so much more
Than clean the building

He's called down angels from on high
And helped someone through a sad goodbye
And lost souls finally find what they've been missing

The congregation will never see
That simple man who still believes
He can change the world
By saying please

Give Johnny Mays
The strength to put that bottle down
Mrs. Bailey and her husband
Find a way to work things out
And Mrs. Olsen hold on long enough
To see her daughter's wedding day

Starts at nine and ten-fifteen

And when I climbed down
To be set free, she took me in again

Beaten on the big people
In the big hard world

When she comes to greet me
She is mercy at my feet
When I see her pin her charm
She just throws it back again

Once I sought an early grave
To find a better land
She just smiled and laughed at me
And took her blues back again

Beaten on the big people

When I saw what I had done
Bound down and flew away the hours
Of her garden and her sun

So I tried to warn her
I'll turn to see her weep

And it's still coming down on me

Dear Dinkie, more it what happened everytime I think about you
It's like the world been on my shoulders, everyday I been without you
My way of living ain't healthy, but I'm trying to be a man
I swear to God I'm fin to lose my cool, and people don't understand
Cause they be coming at me with drama, not knowing I'm going through it
I've been running from suicide, but they pushing me to do it
My nigga I'm telling you, I be needing you by my side
But when I see Danny Boo face, I be knowing I gotta ride
Deep inside it's tearing me up, since I'm praying it'll be ok
I mash the gas a hundred percent, till we together one day
You got a nephew on the way, I forgot to tell you the news
That mean just one more part of us, that'll give them hoes the blues
Our baby brother Jay'Ton, been doing his thang
And since he the youngest, you know mama won't hesitate to complain
And it's the same old thang, one day I'm coming to get you
As long as I'm in these streets, I promise they'll never forget you

You know I'ma rep you forever, with every word coming out this hard time

I couldn't cry, but all the pain inside was killing my pride
I had to be strong, for the sake of Dinkie in his cell
I knew he would lose it, missing you is what put him through hell
Your unborn child, didn't even get to see the day
I never understood why, the Lord'll let em come take you away
And I turned out how you wanted me to be, somebody special
Made the Lord bless you, now you don't have to deal with this pressure
On earth I really miss you, reminiscing bout how we use to be
I was your brother, you was my sister for L-I-F-E
My mission ain't over, till the day that I get the nigga that did it
Whether living or dead, somebody he close to fin to feel it
And I mean it, cause he took one of my loved ones
Now I'm losing focus, writing a letter to my loved one

Knowing that you facing murder, due to the fact these niggas be out of line
I can't explain life, but still I understand
Everything happened for a reason, just part of becoming a man
And I can't tell you how I feel, when I heard that your mama passed
Knowing the last time you seen her, was in visitation through glass
Lord knows keyendation, ain't need to be in your life
So I'ma mash it to the fullest, and make sure they iight
And every night I'm on my knees, to ask the Lord to help you out
Inside my mind without a doubt, I know he bout to let you out
But don't you lose faith, cause faith is important at this time
And I'm your dog to the end, no matter what I'ma be around
South Klique forever, through the sunny and rainy weather
I love you my nigga, that's the reason I'm writing this letter

War means business, even if it's a civil one

Forgotten how to breathe, killed a thousand men
Died a thousand deaths in your sweet dreams

It makes me nauseous

Problems that occur to yourself
Beyond your control
Fault of those who come to our land

Smearing and smarming and coating whilst laughing my body and clothes in their blood and their bite
Eating and munching on flesh is disgusting but hunger won't go so I kill to survive

One by one the dead arise and stagger around looking for somewhere to feed
Our numbers grow as people change and start chewing on each other's meat
Searching more for victims to gnaw and nibble on to get the strength that we need
Figthting to taste the few that remain before there's nothing left to eat

Infected now there is nowhere else for them to left to run
Our army has gathered the undead have come
Breaking into their blocked off boarded up places
My teeth begin to tear away at their terrified faces
Warm feelings inside as their blood starts to drain
Their changes have started soon they'll rise just the same
Hunting for food that's not there like us in vain

One by one more dead arise, trying to find fresh meat to keep them alive
To many zombies not enough people left, we'll have to move on or soon once again we'll all be dead
Searching more for victims to nibble for strength, but we search and find no one left awake
To many zombies not enough people left, we'll have to move on or soon once again we'll all be dead
Because one by one more dead arise, trying to find fresh meat to keep them alive
To many zombies not enough people left, we'll have to move on or soon once again we'll all be dead",Village People of the Damned,2004

Yea son. Let me see this
Oh they didn't have questions like this when I grew up son
But I guess whatever 

It takes to make you be a man son. I'm all for it

Aha, you got that right son. Next question
If you hate another for being successful, what are you? 

You mean like, you rollin' in Benzes, they be like P.H.ing you

Yea son, what is that, what you call that? 
Dad, that only be two words. PLAYA HATA 

Huh, you got that right son. Look like you gonna past this test
But I got one more question for you
Son, if any man depends on another man and can't think on his own
Can't survive on his own, can't take good care of his 

Family, you know what I mean son
I mean, you were put in this world by yourself
You're supposed to depend on you 

And nobody else. I mean son
When a man can't function on his own and put his problems on another man
son, what type of man is that? What do you call that type of person? 

Dad, can I curse? 
Son, if you have to express yourself. Tell me, what type of man is that? 
That a punk ass bitch 

Hehehe, damn little P, you bout it, bout it, just like your daddy
Oh wait, one more question before I leave though

But no one tells me which way to go
I'm caught up in a world
Elaborath a maze
Where yes men could easily be known
I ask them no questions
They give me no answers
Following the wise
But they're walking in pampers
Give me a cigarette
Smoking my cancer
Drink the pain away
But I still have no answers

I'm lost on a road
Don't know which way to go
I'm losing my mind
Losing control of the wheel
And I'm swerving
On and off the road

But survival is a must
Don't know who I can trust
I'm living in a rush
I don't understand the fuss
My brain is bout to bust

I think I'm losing it
I might be losing it
I just might lose
Am I losing my mind?
And I'm so confused I don't know what to do
And I need a clue before I run out of time
Am I losing it?
Am I losing it?
I think I'm losing

Am I losing it?
Am I losing it?
I think I'm losing

They shut us down, we set up shop on another block

Life At The Zoo (Zoo) that's The Battle Field
Niggas In The Camp Starving

My Partner Just Got Caught Up With Them Pills
Already On The Test They Tryna Give Him 12 Years
You Don't Wanna Talk That Murda Game
We Got Blood On Our Hands Block Boys

Put It On Your Cd And Count Your Lil Bar Codes
Get It Real Life Arizona By The Cargo

Blowin' cigarillos stuffed full of that purp
Drunk, burp, shorty hit that muh'fucker
Bet that bitch convert

You don't like me, like what I say
Fuck you I'ma say it anyway

I think your favorite rapper is a sissy
I thought he was a gangster, why they got him lookin' pretty?
Tell them rainbow niggas to come and see me
I'll heavily cut ya, have your torso leaky

The only color I kill over is green
And over them white boys, I'll rupture your spleen
See what I mean? Niggas' hoe believe me
Come and get these hollow tips, my bullets got coppertini

A whole lotta niggas talk a whole lotta shit
But when it goes down they ain't fin' to do shit
Now, do something, do something, do anythang
Do something, do something, I mean anythang

A whole lotta niggas talk a whole lotta shit
But when it goes down they ain't fin' to do shit
Now, do something, do something, do anythang

Even if you're sellin' samples make a profit
Hoe you ain't makin' nuttin? Huh fuck nigga stop it
If you got it why not go on and cop it
Talkin' 'bout what you gon' do, nigga I think you poppin'

Niggas talk a lot but they ain't real doe
You bitch made nigga grab a dildo
Hundred round draw and lean back, do the limbo
You're playin' games with Donkey Kong on Nintendo

I'm King Kong, silverback Congo
Call me Gorilla but my real name 'Lonzo
Runnin' last set, 8 months and a fumble
Zoked you might be but big bro he head honcho

Puff some ad-libs and fuck a rap
I do it for my hood niggas in the fuckin' trap
Who's the king now? You the king of who?
I'm a feral motherfucker, welcome to the zoo

This the third verse let's get to a conclusion
Image is a smokescreen, rappers are illusions
There you go, I said it damn it
If you don't like, fuck ya nigga, go on do somethin' to me

I ain't fazed so they causin' repercussions
Dropped on your ass, try to do some reconstruction
Killer for real gon' handle these niggas
The block is the zoo and the world gon' feel us
These niggas can hate but these bitches gon' feel us

Now I'm sean johned down on the red carpet.

And stay up late
I can't stop, I won't stop

Now we full court press on my own estate.
We used to steal from when dissing when nothing to eat.
Now you can catch me and my hand in these smell meats.
I'm still in the hood, white tee, white ones,
And the chevy strapped up like its fat like big buns.
My phone going ham, niggas leaving stupid messages.
But I ain't mad 'cause the lord keep blessing this.
He kept my mind right, took me through the storm
His soul clear patches nobody lay harm.

Quit your jibbity jabbing man and quit the fucking bullshit.

Grab a nigga hand, nigga help a nigga. Stop talking that shit.
Sit around waiting on somebody to get you something.
Nigga I'm trying to do something help me write a song or something nigga.
I'm trying to make it on Oprah show too. I'm trying to do it big I'm trying to be the nations best.
I'm trying to get money like Bloc. Ya'll niggas stop hating on me man.
You motherfuckers didn't want to help me in the beginning man.

But no one tells me which way to go
I'm caught up in a world
Elaborath a maze
Where yes men could easily be known
I ask them no questions
They give me no answers
Following the wise
But they're walking in pampers
Give me a cigarette
Smoking my cancer
Drink the pain away
But I still have no answers

Don't know which way to go
I'm losing my mind
Losing control of the wheel

On and off the road

But survival is a must
Don't know who I can trust
I'm living in a rush
I don't understand the fuss

Now my crib sittin' on 22 acres (woo)
Get it right fool I gets money(yep)
If you think Ludas not filthy you's a dummy (yep)
I was allergic to the roof on the cutty
So I took the top off like a playboy bunny (what up pops)
Catch me pimpin' in a robe and some slippers (oh)
Ridin' down 85 while I'm stuttin' on my Zixer (ern)
Mouth full of swishers or ridin' with ya sister (woo)

Went from two ounces to a Maserati
First rap check bought choppers for everybody
Before they know what's under my shirt the glock 40
Get 25 a show next month I want 40
Born a real nigga but I'm a die a goon
Just bought a new choppa gon use it real soon
Got the streets on lock homie I can't lose
Put me anywhere I'm the realest nigga in the room(believe me)

I keep a black glock red dot blue flame
Feet hanging out the window jock my shoe game

Rollers in the trunk but in the hoods a semi auto
Clip full of hollow they parked the car they don't want no problem
They know who I are, ya fresh from head to toe
Pull a bitch and I'm gone, take her to the room then I drop her back at home

Someones sleeping on the scene
That's a hell of a dream I'm a hell of a guy
That's a hell of a blunt fire it up lets get high
You can call me g5 cause I be in the clouds
Somewhere in the club with my clothes smelling loud
And never will I smile 'cause I be biting down
Rollin off a p probably muggin with a frown
But naw ain't nothing wrong how could he be on rich
Bitch looked at my whip bitch looked at my wrist
My wrist is tricked in ice my neck is dripped in ice
Bitch look at my life don't you wanna be my wife?
Would you like to be my girl? don't you wanna change your life?
I can change your life grab the credit card and swipe, like see?


Fly fly fly
(Chorus)
I believe I can fly fly fly 2x
I'm so high 4x
I believe I can fly fly fly 2x
I'm so high 4x
I Believe I can fly

You did it to yourself
Now you're all by yourself
Acting like you hate me
I left because you made me

You played me to the left
Now there's nobody left
To hear your complaining
I'm gone and all you hearing is your own

And I'm gone and you're all alone
Can't you hear the

Make up for the time you've wasted
Come slowly
And claim back the boy you left behind

Close the white book
Unplug the brain from the game
'Cause it's time to wipe out
To the stars
Get on the fame

The song is not the same when we're
All played out, played out, all played out
They said the memories
All fade out, fade out, all fade out
Tell me did you feel that?

Don't slow down
Even if it's only to escape
Just down, low down
Before somebody steals your place man

Close the white book
Unplug the brain from the game
'Cause it's time to wipe out

If my whole purpose here wasn't to speak
Now look at the time, I know that I am early today

I'm useless but not for long
The future is coming on
It's coming on
It's coming on
It's coming on

Yeah, ha-ha
Finally, someone let me out of my cage
Now time for me is nothing 'cause I'm counting no age
Now I couldn't be there
Now you shouldn't be scared
I'm good at repairs
And I'm under each snare
Intangible
Bet you didn't think so I command you to
Panoramic view
Look, I'll make it all manageable
Pick and choose
Sit and lose
All you different crews
Chicks and dudes
Who you think is really kickin' tunes?
Picture you gettin' down in a picture tube
Like you lit the fuse
You think it's fictional?
Mystical? Maybe
Spiritual
Hero who appears in you to clear your view when you're too crazy
Lifeless
To those the definition for what life is
Priceless
To you because I put you on the hype shit
You like it?
Gun smokin' righteous with one toke
You're psychic among those
Possess you with one go

I ain't happy, I'm feeling glad
I got sunshine in a bag
I'm useless but not for long
The future is coming on
I ain't happy, I'm feeling glad
I got sunshine in a bag
I'm useless but not for long
The future (that's right) is coming on
It's coming on
It's coming on
It's coming on
It's coming on

The essence, the basics
Without, did you make it?
Allow me to make this
Child-like in nature
Rhythm
You have it or you don't, that's a fallacy
I'm in them
Every sprouting tree
Every child of peace
Every cloud and sea
You see with your eyes
I see destruction and demise (that's right)
Corruption in disguise
From this fuckin' enterprise
Now I'm sucked into your lies
Through Russel, not his muscles but percussion he provides
For me as a guide
Y'all can see me now 'cause you don't see with your eye
You perceive with your mind
That's the inner
So I'ma stick around with Russ' and be a mentor
Bust a few rhymes so motherfuckers remember where the thought is
I brought all this
So you can survive when law is lawless (right here)
Feelings, sensations that you thought was dead
No squealing, remember that it's all in your head

On every block (block)
Late for School, Late for Work
But ahead of these cops (cops)
My credit is shock, in the detinate box (box)
Like, people take my life and that's pathetic as Pac's (Pac's)
A waste of the talent, Say my boys is just no where
Placed on the planet, remain in poisonous warfare
Derelict Arabic terrorists in the air
Shit arrogant apparent to punish people by their heritage,
Nato barriers, Hate embarrassed
There is the faith to cherish
In your room face to face with race awareness
A race to us?? army bombin' your God is with you
Calm the war, we gotta start our pistol
Cause if you right and, know you right, then where's your ritious ways
We sacrifice, snatch your life, many nights and days
Follow me into equality we might behave
And only christ can say the trife will reunite again

America Owns, Without a fucking care in my dome
Bearin' my bones, so far away staring at home
Stay at my zone, falling asleep late with my chrome
Feelin' hype from these rockets burning like straightenin' in the cones
Stay at the streets, bullshit and plans to beef
Spray at your peeps for christmas, give a key to my niece
Real nigga's feel us and fear us
Gorillaz beat on they chest when
Dangerous lyricist, I hope that you hear us
The spirit of Bugz is still in me
God bless it the trinity
Cause my bullets they come in three's like trilogy's
Put the knife away, missles away strike and blaze
So much smoke you can't tell the difference between night and day
Right away blow your life away, so light your haze
Hold tight grenede's so when it blows I'm slightly grazed
Kuniva might be crazed unleashin' unlikely rage
The next time you hear a verse from me I might be caged

Ahiya
Ahayayayayay
Ahiya
Ahiya

Everynight I talk to a black hawk, taking herion in bulks
Watch my body hit the chalks
I'm too lazy, masculines got me crazy
Rape this old lady, while the bitch was having a baby
And I ain't never going home, Bizarre can for go
It's cold I'll be for cyphering, right from wrong
As I sit in my seat and remain calm
And close my eyes and wait for the bomb (Here it comes!)

I'm gettin' the fuck on, I'm aggrivated
I know I'll make it, I'm in a place full of hatred
Treatin' my life like a sacrred
Try to check me, I break your neck
Disrespect me you get injected
It's hectic with some bullshit that happen
You least expected
We just don't accept it nigga
I go ahead, lift my trigger
Get rid of bitches, pay you a visit, then get your shit lit
I'm a nitwit with a big dick, and big balls
I don't miss shit
I hit all, whoever that did this
We Gonna Getch'all

Yo, yo
Now whether its Sadam or Bin Laden
that's been startin all this trouble for us
Creepin horrors doin show after show, sleepin on the tour bus
We lost Aaliyah, lost our families, it takes no Tenges
You don't need us to say the world is fucked up dawgs, we can see it
Now it seems the public needs this shit to calm its kids
'cause they findin out how you lied about your twisted sins
They say we bad for you but shit our music is your friend
They can't deter you from the truth cause we're the helping hand

See me coming, better leave like when bar closing
At the bar posing with my Shawn cold brim
On the bra to get her bra open
See a Gorilla take it they don't ask
I pissed on the bar's desk with laid on cash
My whole state, I'm a grown ass man

You couldn't escape this music even if your name's Houdini
Our tracks say Lah for Life and don't disappear like a genie
Communicating through your airwaves like a giant C.B.
'Cause this one's for your radios or whether you receive me

Our music is so hot, it feels like the sun in Tahiti
We rickety-rock, Gorillaz style is buck wild, believe me
We heavyweights who phase ya like Ali did with Frasier
We spit the most flava but musically, we'll amaze ya

We've been blessed and we've been gifted like Jesus in his manger
Won't you shout 'Hallelujah!' Here comes your music saviour
From your heart to your mind, your spirits to your souls,
We've come to take control with the Gorillaz on patrol

See, our rhymes possess the powers of a superhero
Supernaturally we rock the mic but wit' a natural flow
If you didn't know before, you know now - We told you so
Gorillaz rock your dome just like the one in Tokyo

[2-D]
It's a hard dream to contemplate
I could fall into the abyss-ah
And I love this interlude
It's the reason to deliver

And they called onto me
Says they came to talk to me though
The more of us that lies,
I guess the kids don't live or die

[Si Phili]
'Cause we're makin' this music that's making you lose it
so people don't abuse it and there ain't no way for you to refuse it
Gorillaz be the army that's startin' this pardy-ardy
Makin' more noise than carnivals mixed with the Mardi-Gradi

We're comin' through your town with the sound that's so profound
Gorillaz with the rappers that straight from the underground
We're tearin' it down, makin' you feel this sort of force
Knockin' you to your senses and knockin' you off your course

'Cause we're the source, got you feeling that's so appealing
We got you jumpin' around and bouncin' off of the ceiling
Makin' music ya feeling from Baltimore into Bristol
I know you're hearin' me 'cause my voice is clearer than crystal

The casual, supernatural flows I be exposin',
makin' sure that you're frozen and makin' sure that I'm chosen
to rip a score, makin' you damage the dance floor
Gorillaz and Phi Life'll give you what you ask for

See, our poems, they be flowin' like rivers and resevoirs
'cause Gorllaz, we be out of this world like men of Mars
We rap stars with supernatural spars
We leave your brains amazed with this super music of ours

So put your hands up and stand up - It's time to get down
'Cause Gorillaz and Phi Life, we be breakin' you 'round
From the right to the left, from the skies to the ground
We're coverin' all angles and you can't escape the sound

On the track, it's laid back - We've come to spray raps
Keep it chilled and relaxed but we still sound phat
It's like that when we write raps
We're not from the Empire but we still Strike Back!

Picture you gettin' down in a picture tube

You think it's fictional?
Mystical? Maybe

Lifeless

Every child of peace
Every cloud and sea
You see with your eyes
I see destruction and demise (that's right)
Corruption in disguise
From this fuckin' enterprise
Now I'm sucked into your lies
Through Russel, not his muscles but percussion he provides
For me as a guide
Y'all can see me now 'cause you don't see with your eye
You perceive with your mind
That's the inner
So I'ma stick around with Russ' and be a mentor
Bust a few rhymes so motherfuckers remember where the thought is
I brought all this
So you can survive when law is lawless (right here)
Feelings, sensations that you thought was dead
No squealing, remember that it's all in your head

Innocent of the litany of excessive violence that was growing in the world below
To live in harmony with the spirit of the mountain called Monkey was enough
Then one day, strange folk arrived in the town
They came in camouflage, hidden behind dark glasses, but no one noticed them
They only saw shadows you see, without the truth to the eyes
The happy folk were blind

Falling out of aeroplanes and hiding out in holes
Waiting for the sunset to come, people going home
Jump out from behind them and shoot them in the head
Now everybody dancing, the dance of the dead
The dance of the dead, the dance of the dead

In time, the strange folk found their way into the higher reaches of the mountain
And it was there that they found the caves of unimaginable sincerity and beauty
By chance, they stumbled upon the place where all good souls come to rest
The strange folk, they coveted the jewels in these caves above all things
And soon they began to mine the mountain
It's rich seam fueling the chaos of their own world

Meanwhile, down in the town, the happy folk slept restlessly
Their dreams invaded by shadowy figures digging away at their souls
Every day, people would wake and stare at the mountain
Why was it bringing darkness into their lives?

And as the strange folk mined deeper and deeper into the mountain
Holes began to appear
Bringing with them a cold and bitter wind that chilled the very soul of the Monkey
For the first time, the happy folk felt fearful
For they knew that soon the monkey would stir from it's deep sleep
Then there came a sound, distant first, that grew into castrophany so immense
That it could be heard far away in space
There were no screams, there was no time
The mountain called Monkey had spoken
There was only fire, and then
Nothing

Oh little town in USA, the time has come to see
There's nothing you believe you want
But where were you when it all came down on me?
Did you call me out?",Fire Coming Out of the Monkey's Head,2005

Got a crib with a studio and it's all full of tracks to add to the wall
Full of plaques, hanging up in the office in back of my house like trophies

With lightning fast reflexes
On constant alert

With no drop in pressure
Seems like everybody's

That consumes you

And I'm filled with guilt
From things that I've seen

Ring so I'm a light sleeper

It seems to get cheaper
Out in the desert
With my street sweeper

So said the speaker
With his flight suit on
Maybe to him I'm just a pawn
So he can advance
Remember when I used to dance
Man, all I want to do is dance

So, I'm building above and back

When I get a call from you,
I'm gonna bid it all true, true

It's so cold when I say goodbye
People holding a meaning, why?
But you never let the car get in
Howling on the sound of swim

Did you want a wind and a
sail it would take a boat
All of infinitive rope
Say what you want, don't bring
Anything back to me

And then he started grow up faster
Parents wondered what went wrong
And then he turned into a little monster

Run! Run! Run! Run! Run! Run! Run!
Calm down, don't kill me now!

Well I didn't expect much more,
Son was a little scallywag-wag-wagger!
Can't see much more
If a lesson I'd guess
I'd hold it straight away
Back to the point, give him three Coca-Colas
And run away
Write on the walls and then litter

So Mama, please let us out on the town
We want to drink, we want to fight
We want it all night
We're gonna smash out your neighbour's car

I'm still here!
And I'm still walking out!
See you later, ""calm down, don't kill me now!""
I'm gonna get a job
Cause I'm leaving school
Cause I can't do the Clow, the Clow

Washed up and feeling blue
Heard the sound of footsteps
Drifting softly to the moon

Looking for clear water
I had to take control
Out there in wilderness
Another bullet hole

Playing it all for gods
Yesterday

Idaho, Idaho
There's a beauty on the road
And everyday I look out of the bus
Silver linings getting lost

Floated out into the woods
To hear the old elk call
Touched a rainbow with my hands
I'm dry, I got 'em all

""Ride on,"" said the king of cool
You've got nothing to lose
Tinseltown is down the road
It's the bullet of the noose

 Is what gets me through

 Every night when I lie in my bed
 trying to make some sense
 I just think what I give
 to have you in my arms again
 I tried to run I couldn't see you where the one
 But all roads you know all roads lead back to you
 You're in my blood I've got to have your love
 Cause all roads you know all roads lead back to you
 Cigarette and TV set they don't keep me warm

 My restless sole took control like a hurricane

Gosdin Brothers,"You know I'm wanting to see her
I've looked all over town
Because I really did need her
That it was going 'round
Kinda gives you the feeling you've been used
When its only a matter of things that's been confused
Well now, she wasn't no loser
If you will investigate
But if you're thinking to choose her
You better think when its late
I'm beginning to feel she's not around at all
Had me running high strung, feeling small
Nobody could find her though they looked that day

I could feel you close to me across the room
Last night, oh all right
I found you
What went down there I knew could never leave me
It was that feeling, girl, I got from you
Last night, oh all right
I found you

It's been much too easy to remember sometimes
How empty handed loneliness can be
But when you were there to ease my mind
There was so much of something that I need

Inside misunderstanding lines you have gone
Maybe there's time for something more than what we've done
Wishing not to hold you down with iron binds
Is this day and this time
Is yours is mine

I choose to spend my feelings chance, play the game

That the rain and the shine
Is yours is mine

But this time you got through to me 
So much more
So much more
You say that you need
A way to make your mind up
I need to find out which way to go
If you think you see me
Then maybe we will windup
Bringing back the time that I miss so          
You know that there's so much we can do
We could have everything we need

I thought that maybe you'd see me
Knowing there'd be changes
Is this the way it was to be
The things we planned just yesterday
Was it only something that we had to say
Last night I remember
You looked as though you really cared
Today not the same one
You had another face prepared
The magic of those things we'd seen
Vanished with the words that we were supposed to mean
I called up your name and
Maybe its true that you don't know me
Could this be the same one
Who had so much you wished to show me
I don't know what was to believe
I guess I'll pick my mind up and then I'll leave",The Same One,1967

When I see the sun through my window
I think that everything is going to be all right

But when tomorrow morning comes
I hope that you will see the sun shine too
Come shining through

Gosdin Brothers,"On the streets you look again
At the places you have been
Or the moments that you thought
Where am I going
Though the walls are like the dead
They reflect the things you've said
And the echoes in your head continue showing
Near the castles you can build
Out of dreams you half fulfilled
Won't keep out all of the ill wind that is blowing
And you look still for a trace
Of an opening in a place
Where you find the life that you were used to knowing
You can walk out in the night
And be sure that its alright
To exaggerate the world that's only being
You can watch Regina dance
Through the crystal panes of glass
Yet you know that there's so much that she's not seeing
Still you hold one precious thought
After all this time you've sought
That she might be just protecting what she longs for
And her eyes are veiled with black
Cause she plays she can look back
At the love she wanted so but says is no more
The lights go on, commence the cold
As your senses will be sold
To the parrot watchers mimicing no reasons
To pretend that what they are
From the fact completely far
While the truth may be betrayal, lies and treason
Build their towers in the sand
Down the roads at their command
When the kingdom is the innocence they're stealing
And infection easily spreads
To the searching, twisted heads
As they team up to tear down each others feeling",Echoes,1997
Gosdin Brothers,"Well you're smolderin' with fly words,
Catch the moment on the run
And you say there's nothin' easy
About the plywood tract you're from
And you stand inside your wind stilts
Watch the sentence act begun

So you say you lost your baby
Do you know that your the one
With the stand to watch the trials go,
From here to there behind the scene
Throw your troubles to the moon trolls
To swallow up like stormy dreams
Take an entrance to a stand-off,
Looking if there's such a strife

And you say you lost your baby,
Wondering if its in your life
Well you fly your banners Mondays,
That take a rise and fall in one
Ask the questions of the pilgrims,
As they come to pledge what's done
Claim a tabernacle hillside
Where you'll sight the dyin' sun

Don't you know that you're the one.

The reality is, one day we all gone die
So I'ma just stay on the grind and live it up
Enjoy mines until it's time to give it up

No matter how hard we strive to stay alive
The reality is, one day we all gone die
So I'ma just stay on the grind and live it up
Enjoy mines until it's time to give it up

The wealth of the wicked is laid up for the righteous partner
Watch me get it
Lifestyles of the rich and saved, homie, watch me live it
Ghetto fabulous till I die, I don't care who like it
Get you excited like you been drinking punch and somebody spiked it

Who's the tightest? We are, 2 G'S and the committee
Revealing and instilling game into the lame 'cause they blind, blind
And can't see, don't blame me, put together a hot deal
Took it to be-right, got some act-right, now I could stack tight
Expedite my life to the next flight

Went from being delinquent to having pockets fatter than cellulite
Show you right, took God's word, locked on it like a pit bull bite
Much love to my homie, untouchable, that's in the pen
If he was home, I know he'd say, ""Chille baby, get your ends""
So I'ma live it up

No matter how hard we strive to stay alive
The reality is, one day we all gone die
So I'ma just stay on the grind and live it up
Enjoy mines until it's time to give it up

No matter how hard we strive to stay alive
The reality is, one day we all gone die
So I'ma just stay on the grind and live it up
Enjoy mines until it's time to give it up

Represent to the fullest and I love my coast
So it really don't matter on which side I post
Makin' hits that'll last, burning charts like toast
Everybody got a chance, I just do it the most

Keep it real wit me, I'll keep it real wit you
One day we all gone die, Dogg, it's the truth
Lord knows I'm a nut, never would change that
I was brought with a price, now it's all good, black

Homie, money is supreme but it don't rule me
I know the gold diggaz comin', yeah, they don't fool me
Don't wanna go back to the penitentiary
If I do, just might get strike number three

Live it up, so why criticize and you don't pray and do
A million different things I don't have time to get into?
In the hood's where you'll find me but never mind me, continue

No matter how hard we strive to stay alive
The reality is, one day we all gone die
So I'ma just stay on the grind and live it up
Enjoy mines until it's time to give it up

No matter how hard we strive to stay alive
The reality is, one day we all gone die
So I'ma just stay on the grind and live it up
Enjoy mines until it's time to give it up

You'll find my mind's not focused on my problems
I trust God and keep the faith as I'm mobbin'
We fighting goblins like batman and robin'
In Gotham City, cross the committee and we squabblin'

Line lobbin', rhyme throbbin', mind bogglin'
Got your concubines bobbin' while the rhymes lodgin'
Pray to Jehovah Rock like yola and baking soda
And the gray nova exchange rhymes like payola

I stay solar system resistance designed to go the distance
Adding assistance into elevating your existence
Survivalist found my niche, so I switched
And I wish to be raptured or die rich

No matter how hard we strive to stay alive
The reality is, one day we all gone die
So I'ma just stay on the grind and live it up
Enjoy mines until it's time to give it up

No matter how hard we strive to stay alive
The reality is, one day we all gone die
So I'ma just stay on the grind and live it up
Enjoy mines until it's time to give it up

His resurrection made us qualify
But retrospect, low expectation 'cause we were born to die
Read through the text that can answer every question why
Before you flex, interpretation is what tells the lie

Have you been blessed with ears that can truly hear?
Or is it this that you confess but really live in fear?
The end is near, tut closer is the life at hand, the right to stand
Wallow in poverty was not the plan

Since a man died for the cherished promise
You must acknowledge, people perish for a lack of knowledge
Some went to college, A degree but eternity is what they never find
Mad at me, A young G that's enjoyin' mine, don't sleep

I'm tryin' to live it up, do you consider us delirious?
Niggaz hit us up, trust me you don't wanna trip wit us
Have heart to pick it up and take a sip from the bitter cup
Nigga, what? Don't disturb me, I'm in the process of living it up

No matter how hard we strive to stay alive
The reality is, one day we all gone die
So I'ma just stay on the grind and live it up
Enjoy mines until it's time to give it up

No matter how hard we strive to stay alive
The reality is, one day we all gone die
So I'ma just stay on the grind and live it up
Enjoy mines until it's time to give it up

No matter how hard we strive to stay alive
The reality is, one day we all gone die

I need it, I need it. You can probably see it.
You probably think I'm gonna rip your heart to pieces.
Get you in the sheets, and hit it up and leave it
Believe me, believe me, you are gonna say my reputation proceeds me
Bet you got to be fair
Yo you might have heard about the numbers that I sleep with
That???s not all I am but at least there ain't no secrets

My mumma always told me puppa always warned me don't hang around with around boys like you
Teacher always told me never to be naughty, don't mess around with boys like you
If I had have listened wouldn't be in this position
If I had have listened wouldn't be in this position
If I had have listened wouldn't be in this position
If I had have listened wouldn't be in this position with you

Ay yo you've heard about me right
You???ve known that my rep's renowned
Your friends will tell you stay away because I've slept around
That???s how it works though, the word will get around
Back in the day it didn't faze me though
But lately it has kept me down
And though I brought it on myself
But I ain't mad about it
I kept count, but why the f*** did I brag about it
You know I'll admit it though my rep is deserved
But I'll be real I want to kill it, though cause having that rep is a curse
My last girl cheated on me with a close friend
That???s two relationships, I had to watch them both end
But see it messed with me, the two people I trusted most
I could shrug it off on drunkenness, but f*** them both
See that switched something inside of me
A beast came alive in me and started just eating away the pride in me
Because we're known to make mistakes and I've grown to make a change
I was different back then but now I ain't the same

Momma always told me poppa always warned me don't hang around with boys like you
Teacher always told me never to be naughty don't mess around with boys like you
If I had have listened wouldn't be in this position
If I had have listened wouldn't be in this position

Gossling,"Yeah, listen, before music was a piece of my life
I used to play basketball, that was me every night
I wanted to play college too, yo I'd reach for the sky
Until eighteen I caught some disease in my eye, yeah
I had to stop playing, what should I do?
When ball was the only thing I wanted to do
Listen, that forced me to focus on music
Pez sat me down like ""bro we can do this""
After hearing that I didn't need more really
Going half blind made me see more clearly
Yo I've learnt to take the good with the bad
I'm half blind yeah but now have a look where I'm at
When something seems to turn negative in life
You can always go and turn it into anything you like
So if it happens just remember every time
Yo a tragedy can always be a blessing in disguise

When you're on your own, no one's there for you
When you're all the way home, there'll be a miracle in a costume

Yeah uh
When I was young I was attracted to the dark side
I wanted everyone to see me as the hard guy
Walking around with my mates trying to start fights
Hoping they wouldn't want to 'cause I can't fight
Thinking back now that shit could have ended crazy
I'm just glad that situation never faced me
Back then I was thinking you could never change me
What a dickhead, that's not how my parents raised me
See I wasn't facing the facts
Acting crazy, wishing I could take it all back but
It took one of my mates to get stabbed just to realize
This shit wasn't a game, it was wack
That's how I wrote so fake so easily
'Cause a part of those dudes I could see in me
So if somebody is wanting to fight just swallow your pride and leave it be
And that's real

When you're on your own, no one's there for you
When you're all the way home, there'll be a miracle in a costume

Yeah, yeah, uh
I nearly died in an accident, yeah, and so I wrote this story
It's funny though how the worst thing to happen
Probably was the best thing for me
Falling and flying shouldn't take this long
But thanks to the crash yo I made this song
So now I ain't afraid to see the day that I die
Because with this I'll be staying alive (I'll be staying alive)
Yeah, I believe in believing the sky's the limit
Have a look and you'll see me up there flying in it
It's a nice view, sometimes you might lose
But understand when you fall you can fly too
Don't let anybody tell you what you can't do
Don't let them enter in your head because there aren't you
And understand you could have anything you want
If you put the effort in to remember what you've got

Better run when you hear the sirens coming

One to da two to da three to da four
Line my street, knocking at my door
Twelve black boots on my bedroom floor
What they want with rascal I'm not sure
Took me to the station 8:30
For a fight that I had recently
Say they got me on CCTV
And the black boys told on me
Can't understand why these boys keep snitching
Can't understand why these boys keep bitching
Now I'm hot tempered feel like switching
Can't stand still trigger finger itching
Gotta stay calm, gotta keep my cool

Gotta rise up, gotta stand up tall
Can't let em see the end of Dizzee Rascal

Yo, let's take it back to that old school story telling shit
Get me!
One day I was with my bredwin 'A dot' roaming the streets
On the main road hungry looking for something to eat
Not no burger and no chips that's easily digested
That shit that if your caught, you'll be easing arrested
We was on the robin street I forgot to mention Kate
There was this Breda rolling with us he was scared it was blait,
And he was high
But, back to the story 'A dot' spotted the man
Straight ahead of us in the distance with his wifey holding hands
So we followed him through this little alleyway into the flats
And we thought the time was perfect so we crept up and we attacked
I took the first swing unexpected causing panic
We was ruthless causing agony in public it was tragic
Me and 'A dot' lost the plot, acting like we were from hell
Beat this Breda to the floor beat his wifey up as well
Clayton stood back shaking, wishing that he never came
When from out of nowhere there was Alisha screaming my name
She went my school
She saw it all

To make it worse I'm hearing sirens, I ain't even trying handle

Running through the streets brave face it's a jack one
Real day light no shame like a lunatic
Rain, hell, sleet or snow I ain't new to it
Show me what you got betta give it up quickly
Lay them on their back if they try and fight swiftly
Better mind out when they come through the manner man
Keep em on their toes like hammer man
It's no joke man woman and child I'm seeking
See no skets no age I'm creeping
Anything through the door cold on the wheelers
Duck from the feds and I roll with the Dealers

Gota,"The light in the window is a crack in the sky
A stairway to darkness in the blink of an eye
A levee of tears to learn she'll never be coming back
The man in the dark will bring another attack

Your mamma told you that you're not supposed to talk to strangers
Look in the mirror and tell me do you think your life's in danger here

No more tears, tears, tears
No more tears, tears, tears
No more tears, tears, tears
No more tears, tears, tears

Another day passes as the night closes in
The red light goes on to say it's time to begin

I see the man around the corner waiting, can he see me?
I close my eyes and wait to hear the sound of someone screaming here

No more tears, tears, tears
No more tears, tears, tears
No more tears, tears, tears
No more tears, tears, tears

It's just a sign of the times
Going forward in reverse
Still, these were our first
Its just a hand in the bush
A hand in the bush

So now that it's over can't we just say good-bye? (bye-bye, bye-bye)
I'd like to move on and make the most of the night
Maybe a kiss before I leave you this way
Your lips are so cold I don't know what else to say

I never wanted it to end this way my love, my darling
Believe me when I say to you in love I think
I'm falling here

No more tears, tears, tears
No more tears, tears, tears
No more tears, tears, tears
No more tears, tears, tears

It's just a hand in the bush

Proyecto Gotan... desde el Koxmoz para el mundo...si, soy yo… y la voz de mi pensamiento...mis pensamientos... pensamientos del corazón.
Cómo es la clave, cuál el secreto? Para estar en paz por completo, dos pies en la tierra y un relato desde hace rato me tienen sujeto. El mundo es mi suelo, el cielo mi techo, Buenos Aires donde cosecho mis anhelos y mis pasiones, pero solo hay vacío y no estoy satisfecho.
Si hablo de amor... se que la extraño, de mis actos en vida soy dueño, pero me calla el dolor por el daño, es como un sueño dentro de otro sueño. Apuesto a pleno pero de callado, cada uno en la suya, yo ando rayado, sigo esperando sentado... que esta vez el destino no me deje plantado... que no me deje plantado... no nena.
Escuchame bien... no es chamuyo...es amor. 

(Chili Parker)
Me la batió un gomía che, la culpa no fue mía, de amor yo no se nada, lo mío es la astronomía, vos sabias bien que yo era un mamarracho, vos lo sabias bien...soy un borracho. Así que ya no me reclames, no me esperes flaca ya no me llames, todos lo saben prefiero ser MC, hasta el farolito de la calle en que nací. Tengo una balada para un loco, que la compuse yo, para mi, porque estoy loco, y eso me provocó que en vos pensase, y así un poema nace. Los más hábiles dejamos pasar los abriles, inmóviles para no quedar como giles, así ya no me enamoro de nuevo... así ya no me enamoro de vos de nuevo.

In a mean caress
You are gone, you're the one
We are praying for you

Why do you believe in hell?
Why do you believe in love divine?
In your dark and twisted mind

And with the force of any evil spell
Repulsive hymns will unleash the creatures
Disturbing images of decadence

Gottfried Boettger,"Listen to my tale of woe, 
It's terribly sad but true, 
All dressed up, no place to go 
Each evening I'm awfully blue. 

I must win some handsome guy 
Can't go on like this, 
I could blossom out I know, 
With somebody just like you. So

Oh, sweet and lovely lady, be good 
Oh, lady, be good to me 
I am so awfully misunderstood 
So lady, be good to me 
Oh, please have some pity 
I'm all-alone in this big city 
I tell you I'm just a lonesome babe in the wood, 
So lady be good to me.

Gottfried Boettger,"It was the third of June, another sleepy, dusty Delta day
I was out choppin' cotton and my brother was balin' hay
And at dinner time we stopped and walked back to the house to eat
And Mama hollered out the back door ""y'all remember to wipe your feet""
And then she said ""I got some news this mornin' from Choctaw Ridge""
""Today Billy Joe MacAllister jumped off the Tallahatchie Bridge""

'n' Papa said to Mama as he passed around the blackeyed peas
""Well Billy Joe never had a lick of sense, pass the biscuits, please""
""There's five more acres in the lower forty I've got to plow""
'n' Mama said it was shame about Billy Joe, anyhow
Seems like nothin' ever comes to no good up on Choctaw Ridge
And now Billy Joe MacAllister's jumped off the Tallahatchie Bridge

'n' Brother said he recollected when he and Tom and Billie Joe
Put a frog down my back at the Carroll County picture show
And wasn't I talkin' to him after church last Sunday night?
""I'll have another piece-a apple pie, you know it don't seem right""
""I saw him at the sawmill yesterday on Choctaw Ridge""
""And now ya tell me Billie Joe's jumped off the Tallahatchie Bridge""

'n' Mama said to me ""Child, what's happened to your appetite?""
""I've been cookin' all morning and you haven't touched a single bite""
""That nice young preacher, Brother Taylor, dropped by today""
""Said he'd be pleased to have dinner on Sunday, oh, by the way""
""He said he saw a girl that looked a lot like you up on Choctaw Ridge""
""And she and Billy Joe was throwing somethin' off the Tallahatchie Bridge""

A year has come 'n' gone since we heard the news 'bout Billy Joe
'n' Brother married Becky Thompson, they bought a store in Tupelo
There was a virus going 'round, Papa caught it and he died last Spring
And now Mama doesn't seem to wanna do much of anything
And me, I spend a lot of time pickin' flowers up on Choctaw Ridge
And drop them into the muddy water off the Tallahatchie Bridge",Ode to Billy Joe,2006

Big lies, they always have been told
But right now you face another man
This time I turn the page around
No rhyme, no reason to be found
Why should I play the fool again

I keep on running in circles
In a crazy human race that never ends
I was never taking more than I needed
Always standing at the end of the line
Waiting for my turn to succeed it
But it's hard to keep playing the part
When there's nothing left at all

How come we always run for more
The rich is stealing from the poor
How come we're never satisfied
Don't know what I'm afraid to loose
Somehow I'm not allowed to choose
God knows I've never really tried

And Still we running in circles

Where is love when the hate is too strong?
Where is love when it's gone?

Is it beyond the sea?
Does it hide beneath the willow tree
Waiting for us to get back where we’re from?

Hope you will forgive us for what we’ve done
We don’t know where to begin
We’re too numb to take it in

Or a god show up
You heard me!
Don't cry now
If yo people can't identify yo ass now

hahaha...
Take me out this motherfucker",Don't Cry,1998
Gotti,"Yo, yo, what's up nigga? You know the streets is a jungle
You gotta survive out here
You need a strong mind to do the shit I do
You ever seen something blown up before
See that nigga cross the street in that Cutlass
Check this out

[Chorus x2]
Survival of the fittest, respect my come up
Survival of the fittest, you better not run up

I remember back in 89 a nigga used to steal
And now I got a Navi with a mothafucking grill
One time chase a nigga through the fucking alley
Mad cause I fucked up my only pair of Bally's
I used to smoke weed with the ballers after school
Mothafuckas wanted to hang cause I used to act a fool
Started slanging rocks because the shit was fun
I used to bang at niggaz just to see them run
People started hearing shit started recognizing me
Big timers fronted me some coke and a ride g
Dope became a business, no longer a hobby
I owed a nigga 5 g's so I started robbing
I knew I had to move before I had to bang him up
I'm a act a donkey if you don't respect my come up
Dumb niggaz die and real niggaz live
The ghetto is so wicked I can't even trust my kids

[Chorus x2]

Started in this game at the age of thirteen
Getting paid making money serving crack to the fiends
Hoes couldn't take me, niggaz gave me jealous looks
To the world I was a man, to the feds I was a crook
Put my face up in the paper, put my name in they books
Cause they see a nigga balling off the birds that I cooked
As the years went by still survival of the fittest
Now I'm riding in the tank representing to the fullest
Putting bullets in you bitches jealous niggaz in disguise
Shooting niggaz til we die, Gambino's on the rise
My nigga Fiend up by my side, my enemy bound to die
Got no mercy in my eyes label Gotti one of the realest

[Chorus x2]

I was born a bastard, my pops was a thug
Four years in the pen for transporting drugs
I was Known in the hood as a nigga with the weight
Bithces all up in my business, shipping keys from state to state
Triple beams in the project, Calliope where I broke 'em down
Razor blades and baking soda, pure white fuck the brown
My clientele was growing started investing in some other shit
Barber shops on every block, even had a weed spot
Moms and the kids put away up in the house
A fellas Cameras in the lawn to spook a nigga out
Pitbulls in the backyard trained to kill
Call my folks up on the phone before I made a deal
I'm one step ahead of a nigga doing wrong
That's why I'm still alive and been on top so fucking long
I had to spank some busters, to show 'em I mean business
The ghetto is so wicked its survival of the fittest

[Chorus x2]",Survival of the Fittest,1998
Gotti,"After the show it's the after party then
After the party it's the hotel lobby and
After the Belve' then it's probably Cris'
And after the original it's probably this (fiesta)
Yes ma, Bed-Stuy, fiesta
Remix with the homie from the Midwest side
Game recognize game, hoes do too
It's the new 2 Live Crew, I suppose you knew
So thugs, pop yo' toasters, but don't approach us or
Bullets'll chase you like Moet mimosas
Catch us both coasts, racin' twin Porsche's
Boxes with glocks that'll pop ya to make ya ghost-es
Whoever come closest you've been warned
But niggas don't get the picture 'til the weapons is drawn
Make your way backstage, baby girl it's on
And we'll be drinkin' 'til six in the mornin'

In the back of the club with ma-ma
Poppin' bottles of Cris with ma-ma
Put the bar on the tab for ma-ma
Throwin' hundreds up for grabs for ma-ma
Cause it's about to go down tonight
I'm a be drinkin' 'til the early liz-ight (that's right)
Nigga high like a muh'fuckin ki-zite
Take three honies just to make me feel ri-zight
My, my, my, my
It's what they all say when they see the frozen ice
They say my, my, my, my
Anytime they see them big things only cause I

While y'all gotta club date, I'm fuckin' wit arenas
Gotcha man sayin' ""Kelly have you seen her?""
Yeah she wit me on the low
Gettin' high off the 'dro, got her knees on the flo'

Fiesta, fiesta, fiesta
Fiesta, fiesta
Fiesta, fiesta
Fiesta, fiesta
Fiesta, fiesta
Fiesta, fiesta
Fiesta, fiesta
Fiesta, fiesta

Switchin' lanes in my Six, in the 'burbs
I met a broad named Tasha, in the 'burbs
Took the hood then I moved it, to the 'burbs
Now no more sheriffs or polices, in the 'burbs (that's right)
And we about to tear this club up
Don't worry 'bout expenses cause I got that sho' 'nough
Ready to BOO like I'm fresh outta jizzail
I need some WOO from all the honey's on the DL
I said my, my, my, my (yeah)
It's what them thugs yellin' when the strippers on fizzles
They say my, my, my, my (yeah)
Got Kisha yellin' from that up and down sizzle

While y'all gotta club date, I'm fuckin' wit arenas
Gotcha man sayin' ""Kelly have you seen her?""
Yeah she wit me on the low
Gettin' high off the 'dro, got her knees on the flo'

I put the big body up, come through in a Rover
Not only Kelly and Gotti, it's Boo and Hova
Pop Cris if you like, my ice glist' in the light
I'm wit Roc-Land right, so I'm rich for life
I'm like Heaven, everybody wanna get to me
How you make it to the gates and forget the key?
I'm the one God chose so you blessed through me
Gotti Floyd getchu higher than that ecstasy

Hey yo I come through stunnin',
Plus I'm gettin' blunted in the new six-hundred with the big rims on it
We rock rocks that'll light ya shoulders
Gotta lotta hot cars but the drops is colder (ah)
You see V-I-P me, Kelly, Gotti, and Hov'
Drinkin' Cris' like its H-2-O
All we do is spend cheese cause we love the dough
Mami roll more trees before it's time to go

If you got cash money then you feel this shit
And if you rollin' on them things then you feel this shit
If you drunk off in the club then you feel this shit
If you'se a motherfuckin' thug then you feel this shit
If you smokin' on some 'dro then you feel this shit
And if you off that ecstasy you got's to feel this shit
If you sippin' on some Cris' you got's to feel this shit
And if you throwin' up and shit, you got's to feel this shit

Shine my teets, when I hit these streets
Call hot boy Elvin, to slide me a piece
Slipped it girl, fed her some gas
I buh-a burn, I buh-a, buh-a burn ya ass
Brawlers, bars, and marble's garage
Minks on the floor, with them platinum toys
Its 500 degrees, it's hot as fuck (uh uh-a, uh uh-a)
Believe me boy, my shit diced up
I stay one way, I play every day
Its February 15th, stunna, how's the day?

[Mannie Fresh]
Now if you believe, like I believe
We can get to the mountain top
We can achieve what Martin was talkin' bout
what's all the barkin' bout?
I'm a man playa, on my two feet, that's how I'm walking out
a lot of these chumps niggas say I just bling too much
But a lot of y'all ain't doing nothing, y'all just dream too much
And all of y'all niggas ain't coming up to nuttin but a big ole zero
And in case you didn't know nigga, I'm the hood hero

[Chorus - Gotti]
It's like a sunny day, plus I'm getting money today
With no funny play, 'cause I got the gun at my waist
And like stunna say, feeling like a hunter today
Million, mommy fine, but she got bumps in her face
But it ain't nothing but a G thang baby
So I'ma hit it in the back of my Mercedes
We on dubs, it's all love, this shit crazy
And Cash Money is the label that made me

[Mikkey]
Mikkey take em church, its on you what you take from this verse
We like a cedar, we just straight from the dirt
So it's in us, we stuck, like it's in us to
Cock..that..thang..back..and dump
Please, you don't want it wit us
Now they say money makes the world go round
But for the right price,
Stunna said yo girl done with the opposite of up
More than music this is rap hustlin'
This is money mackin' and publishin'
Death before struggling, that's shine daddy

[Chorus]",Sunny Day,2002
