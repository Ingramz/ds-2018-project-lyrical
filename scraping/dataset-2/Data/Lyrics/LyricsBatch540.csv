Ken Darby Choir & Instrumental Group,"Rock of Ages, cleft for me,
Let me hide myself in Thee,
Let the water and the blood,
From Thy wounded side which flowed,
Be of sin the double cure,
Save from wrath and make me pure.

Not the labor of my hands
Can fulfill Thy lawÃ¢??s demands,
Could my zeal no respite know,
Could my tears forever flow,
All for sin could not atone,
Thou must save, and Thou alone.

Nothing in my hand I bring,
Simply to Thy cross I cling,
Naked, come to Thee for dress,
Helpless, look to Thee for grace,
Foul, I to the fountain fly,
Wash me, Savior, or I die.

While I draw this fleeting breath,
When my eyes shall close in death,
When I rise to worlds unknown,
And behold Thee on Thy throne,
Rock of Ages, cleft for me,
Let me hide myself in Thee.",Rock of Ages,1954

Comes a driftin' on the evening breeze.

Un-til the darkness sheds its veil
There'll be Blue Shadows on the Trail.

Ken Darby Singers,"An old cowpoke went riding out one dark and windy day,
Upon a ridge he rested as he went along his way,
When all at once a mighty herd of red-eyed cows he saw,
A ploughin' through the ragged skies
And up a cloudy draw.
Yippee-yi-ay, yippee-yi-o,
The ghost herd in the sky.

Their brands were still on fire and their hooves was made of steel,
Their horns wuz black and shiny and their hot breath he could feel,
A bolt of fear went through him as they thundered through the sky,
For he saw the riders comin' hard
And he heard their mournful cry.
Yippee-yi-ay, yippee-yi-o,
Ghost riders in the sky.

Their faces gaunt their eyes were blurred and shirts all soaked
With sweat,
They're ridin' hard to catch that herd but they ain't caught them yet
'Cause they've got to ride forever on that range up in the sky,
On horses snortin' fire
As they ride on, hear their cry.
Yippee-yi-ay, yippee-yi-o,
Ghost riders in the sky.

As the riders loped on by him he heard one call his name,
""If you want to save your soul from hell a-riding on our range,
Then cowboy change your ways today or with us you will ride
A-try'ng to catch the devil's herd
Across these endless skies.""

The belfries of all Christendom
Had rung so long the unbroken song

Mo Thugs debut, respresentin' the Land we the bomb-ass album
We out, comin' in the door
Raised to the game of the streets
Tryin' to come up on millions
This game, we play for keeps
Straight from the underground
Bum rush Cleveland, tunnel to the industry
Trues roll deep from coast to coast, gotta that money
Break any show off the real, recognize we show-stoppers
II Tru's comin' to get ya fools
Chart-toppers, gotta put the 9-7 perimeter lock down
Show these playa haters the greatest family ya found
We put it down worldwide
We know about trues
Keep ya bobbin' your head by makin' major moves

(Chorus)
[Jhaz]
Never been no lame
Always been true game
Roll thick with the Mo Thug click and a sack, man
Game for days, see by the pennies selects
Puttin' it down for the Land on this track for Krayzie
Play me on the north and the east, too, west coast
And the south ? did to II Tru
Proved that we was hard on Family Scriptures
Now, hit ya with this New Breed thang, settin' it off
Off the rippa, get ya hands up for the new breed
Crack the top on the Hen, fire up the green
Floss in the hood, peep the vibe
Kick back relax, do it up for the summer time

(Chorus)
[Ken Dawg]
It's continuous play, coast to coast, game I wax
Won't you relax?
Sit back, and lay my head against you
Crack inhale the barbecues
Early morning get the ribs burnin'
Thangs turnin', lick your tonsils on the bourbon
Is we hurtin' these boys off a platinum debut?
You gotta come new, oh, where the old school?
II Tru and Ken Dawg, 9-7, summer time
Maintainin' these last days by movin' up the grind
Niggas dyin' while I'm on this hella chase
Tryin' to avoid those who hate
Can you relate?
We can all get paid and ride drops this summer
If the cops try to stop us, slide and roll the chumps

Nigga, it's the year for playa haters will be exposed
These niggas fallin' off going out for these hoes
Trick tellin' you what the fuck she gonna do
I keep on tryin' to tell you these hoes got game to
So where's your mack hand? want to be mack man
Turn around, slap that bitch with a backhand
Damn, now your girl got ya cuffed on your way gone
Prepare to do about thirty days strong
See that homeboy, I told ya gotta be a soldier
Fuckin' with Cleveland, yeah, here to fold ya
Nigga, I'm for real about this shit that I spit
Off this Hen and drove my mind, always stay lit
Now what's happenin?
Cleveland in this bitch for real
I'm tryin' to look out for my dogs
Cause these hoes can kill
Trick, how you do yours behind close doors
Cause a nigga know about you on the down-low
I'm the player type, I lay it right off the jump
Puttin' some shit in your trunk that's gon' bump
But broad I really can't blame you
Playas will learn, these hoes got game too, righ

[Chorus]
Ain't no reason for the games these hoes play

[Verse 2]
Now, I done seen these hoes come in all shapes and sizes
Fake to wise, ho don't mistake the height
Yeah, you got a downfall in someway or another
Tryin' to take out the next young brother
Lover of this man, greed, indeed
Sayin' you love to fuck, and smoke all his weed
Hey, that's the way life goes for these hoes
Playa, the next thing to stay up on your toes
Cause-a, like I told ya these hoes got game
Runnin' down a line of niggas like an Amtrak train
Can't explain why, I'm too busy high
Herb got my mind, seein' that I'm passin' em by
Mission impossible, cause these hoes simply incapable
Goin' for the cash, and dash first chance available
Bitch, really understand me
Ken D-A-W-G from the L-A-N-D
And I got game to come back on you twice as nice
Verbally hittin' your dome like it was a fight
Can't let me get all caught up in some shit
I let you know off the riff that I ain't havin' it, you hoes got game

[Chorus]
Ain't no reason for the games these hoes play

[Verse 3]
I wonder, was this a setup?
Cause I know these nigga playa hatin'
You said there was money involved, waiting, huh
So now I come and see what it is
I handle my biz cause I gotta kid.
And a, soon as leave out the door, I hear some shit
I didn't pay it no mind 'til I heard a click
What the fuck? These niggas tryin' to rob
Undercover setup bitch behind a job
Uh, had a nigga thinkin' it was about paper [damn]
Bitch, but this bitch was really on her caper
Now, I gotta wet up this bitch
Hope in the meantime, this ho get hit
Damn, ain't no reason for the games that you play
Don't want to die today, but that's the price to pay
Uh, next time I pass up on that cash
Next time, I pass up on that ass
Bitch, tried to get me straight got
Ain't no reason for the shots, you done peep the plot
When the law come, I can't explain
Cause I'm gonna let you know that you hoes got game, right

Face me, you claim to be the sweetest
But the style I flex is crazy, never again no struggles
See Mo Thug, we on the rise everyday
I feel the swisha as my method of the high
No more want for money or place to eat or sleep
You see we family, now
Comin' up in game backdoor with the heat
Krayzie's friends out the walls
? by my lonely, before a sista was broke
Blow up Mo Thug open up more money...

It be the Mo Thug, it's buck, quick bandages
One of these soldiers just can't stand 'em

Fin to dip home, get shot
Blown, who the next blown?

[Sin]
Tell me have you ever had this feelin'
Or a vision, that you played major part in a killin'?
The man that you murdered let's say for instance
That it's sickness and you did him
Pull the trigger bust the gun (are they evil)
The motive was death
You took his breath without a second guess
His chest was littered with blood
That pop unleashed, now fill the bag
Along with the shells from the slugs
And when they finally found him
All they got was the smell and the skull
Now further endanger the species
'Cause these niggas they plot
They rush up on the block with shots
From fully automatic weaponry
They had to be a least two or three cars deep
Then all of a sudden
One came up hatin' face to face with ?
Come around our way, you lay six feet
In a grave underneath in a coffin

[Tony Tone]
It's that Hustla with Hustla'z poetically known as Tony Tone
With them thugstas and Shifters, trues, and a playa
Let it be known that we're trues with weapons
Double I'm steppin', Mo Thug militant soldiers
Sucka better feel this bass
On the real, this fake
Don't needs this in this click
Now, you want to ride or die
Because there's hatred in your eyes?
I'd advise stay wise, better pray to God
'Cause these scriptures might
Just rip your mentals straight apart
It's from the heart
Demons that drop our lives got pinned inside
Realized they fell off
So many want to roll, but don't know how we stroll
They never know we're good go

I remember my first day out of prison
Y'all, it was just me and my cousin
Takin' a ride in his car
We just went puffin' and sippin' on brews
Trippin' up old trues
Layzie asked me, ""What you gonna do? What you gonna do?""
I said, ""I don't know. I'm gonna take it slow
So gimme a couple of days, and I will let you know.""
I had to collect my mind
Knowin' one day I'm gonna shine
Until that day, I will pray
And try to parlay with the struggle God done dealt me
I know that He'll help me
Through the stormy weather
Our families got together and stay strong
But you gotta keep your head up high
'Cause there ain't no reason
Why you got to let it down
Just look around, we platinum bound (bound, bound)

And I want you to know (I want you to know)
That through the rain, cloudy skies
And the thunderbolts, it ain't easy
(It ain't easy, you know, you know ain't easy)
Ask my folks, just ask my folks
And I won't blame it on the rain
(I won't blame it on the rain)
I can make it through the pain
To the otherside of the game
I won't blame it on the rain
(I won't blame it on the rain)
I can make it through the pain to the otherside of the game

Everything I ever knew since the day I was born
Consisted strictly of some type of a hustle
While my Mama workin' nine-to-five
On some nights, I be sittin' home alone
'Cause she'd be workin' doubles to survive
Makin' ends meet the best way she knew how
Keepin' food up on the table
Teachin' me the ways of the world - pick your friends
Like you do your fruit
Keep your distance from the playa hater
Pray you never have to shoot
I remember also on somedays there'd be nothin'
In our refrigerator except for a box of baking soda
And empty jar of pickle juice
I often wonder why the Lord
Had to create me in a world, oh so, so cruel
It's dog eat dog, I don't know what else to do
Except for call on God
Put my trust in You
No more, we're warriors.

I remember I went to school
With only about three pairs of pants, holes in my shoes
I guess I know what they mean by cold city blues
Ken bagged the stores
Tryin' to get money the best way I know how
How? Me and my brother up there
'Til hustlin' was no longer allowed
I know it's hard times
I'm learnin' this early to be a man
But since then, Ken Dawg flipped a whole new masterplan
Damn, don't nobody understand, but my family
But look at us now: the plan was to create jams
Ken Dawg, do or die, Mo Thug all the way to my dirt
I know it hurt the way we put in work
Can't do nothin', but ride with it, 'til it's over
From Novas to Range Rovers, we're still soldiers

You see a fellow like me
Done had it through all the wicked madness
Everyday I gotta fight this demon
Sadness take over my world of gladness
Then they want to ask me,
""Why do we all stay so high, fiendin'?""
Come kick it the way we roll
That's if you can handle it, baby
Without you tryin' to hate me, never
No more, so fuck 'em, look at this hate
Now stroll and get on my hustle
To keep my pockets swoll for sure
I collect more of those
Still we prefer takin' bills that fold
To hoes, me and my trues decided
To plot you for your dues
Come through with the battle
Ran through your house
And robbed the people next door
Moved out neighborhood
Now, who would you blame it on?
The ghetto?
Why this old crooked system set up to mess us up
But we come up and never fade the soldiers' ghetto

And I want you to know (ooh, I want you to know)
That through the rain, cloudy skies
And the thunderbolts, it ain't easy)
Ask my folks, just ask my folks (just ask my folks)
And I won't blame it on the rain
(We can't blame it on the rain)
I can make it through the pain
To the otherside of the game
I won't blame it on the rain (oh, no, yeah)
I can make it through the pain
To the otherside of the game.

Stormy weather tossin' my boat to and fro
Often to the point of shatterin' senses
I don't know which way to go
Somethin' inside persistin' me to move on
Just maintain, hold on, but my son, just keep it strong
Everything gon' be alright
Keep you're head to the sky
Just as long as you keep it real
And strive to reach the golden prize
Did what I had to do to make it this far
A lot of people got stuck
And I took enough battle scars
Took refuge worldwide to replenish my thought
I was not ready to accept them devilish clout
Drop to my knees, and began to do nothin' but pray
Gradually, life began to change
I'm in this Mo Thug game
We statin' our claim
We statin' our claim
We statin' our claim
We statin' our claim

Would you forgive me, Lord
If I killed that man - that man
That tried to run up and rob me blindly
And leave me for dead was his intent?
But, Lord, I may be like that on the outside
Inside I'm one that's searchin' for peace
Right, as we ride deep
And seek holy scriptures, believe
Rollin', nobody knows what it is or who we approachin'
Just strollin', trustin' in the Lord (in the Lord)
As we struggle to make it each day, baby
You can believe that they keep gettin' harder with the time
With haters and evil
And sometimes it's even my people
And it feel like I'm losin' my mind
Fire, you need to burn this entire evil, evil empire

And I want you to know (to know)
That through the rain, cloudy skies
And the thunderbolts, it ain't easy
(Through the rain, through the clouds
Through the thunderbolts)
Ask my folks, just ask my folks
And I won't blame it on the rain
(And we can't blame it on the rain, no)
I can make it through the pain
To the otherside of the game
I won't blame it on the rain
(We can make it through the pain)
I can make it through the pain
To the otherside of the game",Otherside/Otherside (Outro),1998

You'll remember yesterday
In its haunting strain
Vienna lives again
Free and bright and gay
In your mind a sudden gleam
Of a half forgotten dream
Seems to glimmer when you hear the third man theme

Once again there comes to mind
Someone that you left behind
Love that somehow didn't last
In that happy city of the past
Does she still recall the dream
That rapture so supreme
When first she heard the haunting third man theme?

Carnivals and carousels and Ferris wheels and parasols
The Danube nights, the dancing lights again will shine

Keeps swirling in your brain
Like new may wine
Strauss waltzes, candle-glow
And the laughter of long ago

Ken Freeman,"Artilleryman: We're gonna build a whole new world for ourselves. Look, they clap eyes on us and we're dead, right? So, we gotta make a new life where they'll never find us. You know where? Underground. You should see it down there, hundreds of miles of drains, sweet and clean now after the rain, dark, quiet, safe. We can build houses and everything, start again from scratch. And what's so bad about living underground, eh? S'not been so great living up here, if you want my opinion.

Brave New World

      Artilleryman
      Take a look around you at the world we've come to know
      Does it seem to be much more than a crazy circus show
      Maybe from the madness, something beautiful will grow
      In a brave new world, with just a handful of men,
      We'll start... we'll start all over again!
      All over again! All over again! All over again!

      Artilleryman: We'll build shops and hospitals and barracks, right under their noses, right under their feet. Everything we need: banks, prisons and schools. We'll send scouting parties to collect books and stuff, and then like you we'll teach the kids. Not poems and rubbish; science, so we can get everything working! We'll build villages and towns, and... and we'll play each other at cricket! Listen, maybe one day we'll capture a fighting machine, eh, learn how to make 'em ourselves, and then: WALLOP! Our turn to do some wiping out! WHOOSH! With our heat ray! Whoosh! And them running and dying, beaten at their own game, man on top again!

      Artilleryman
      Now our domination of the earth is fading fast,
      And out of the confusion a chance has come at last,
      To build a better future from the ashes of the past,
      In a brave new world, with just a handful of men,
      We'll start all over again!

      Look, man is born in freedom, but he soon becomes a slave,
      In cages of convention from the cradle to the grave,
      The weak fall by the wayside but the strong will be saved,
      In a brave new world, with just a handful of men,
      We'll start all over again!

      I'm not trying to tell you what to be,
      Oh no, oh no, not me...
      But if mankind is to survive, the people life alive,
      They're gonna have to build this world anew
      And it's going to have to start with me and you... YES!

      I'm not trying to tell you what to be,

      But if mankind is to survive, the people left alive,
      They're gonna have to build this world anew
      Yes and we will have to be the chosen few...

      Just think of all the poverty, the hatred and the lies,
      And imagine the destruction of all that you despise,
      Slowly from the ashes the phoenix will arise,
      In a brave new world, with just a handful of men
      We'll start all over again!

      Take a look around you at the world you've loved so well,
      And bid the aging empire of man a last farewell
      It may not sound like heaven but at least it isn't hell
      It's a brave new world with just a handful of men,
      We'll start, we'll start all over again!
      All over again! All over again! All over again!
      I'VE GOT A PLAN!

      Artilleryman: Can't you just see it? Civilization starting all over again! A second chance! Heh- we'll even build a railway and tunnel to the coast, go there for our holidays! Nothing can stop men like us! I've made a start already. Come on down here and have a look.

In the cellar there was a tunnel scarcely ten yards long. It had taken him a week to dig. I could have dug that much in a day, and I suddenly had my first inkling of the gulf between his dreams and his power.

      Artilleryman: It's doing the working and the thinking that wears a fellow out. I'm ready for a bit of a rest. How about a drink, eh? Nothing but champagne now I'm the boss.

We drank, and then he insisted upon playing cards. With our species on the edge of extermination, with no prospect but a horrible death, we actually played games. Later he talked more of his plan, but I saw flames flashing in the deep blue night, red weed glowing, tripod figures moving distantly, and I put down my champagne glass. I felt a traitor to my kind, and I knew I must leave this strange dreamer.

Ken Freeman,"There were a dozen dead bodies in the Euston road, their outlines softened by the black dust. All was still, houses locked and empty, shops closed, but looters had helped themselves to wine and food, and outside a jewelers some gold chains and a watch were scattered on the pavement.

      Martian: Ulla!

I stopped, staring towards the sound. It seemed as if that mighty desert of houses had found a voice for its fear and solitude.

      Martian: Ulla!

The desolating cry worked upon my mind. The wailing took possession of me. I was intensely weary, footsore, hungry and thirsty. Why was I wandering alone in this city of the dead? Why was I alive when London was lying in state in its black shroud? I felt intolerably lonely, drifting from street to empty street, drawn inexorably towards that cry.

      Martian: Ulla!

I saw, over the trees on Primrose Hill, the fighting machine from which the howling came. I crossed Regent's Canal. There stood a second machine, upright, but as still as the first.

      Martian: Ulla!

Abruptly, the sound ceased. Suddenly the desolation, the solitude, became unendurable. While that voice sounded London still seemed alive. now suddenly there was a change, the passing of something, and all that remained was this gaunt quiet.
I looked up, and saw a third machine. It was erect and motionless, like the others. An insane resolve possessed me: I would give my life to the Martians, here and now.
I marched recklessly towards the titan and saw that a multitude of black birds were circling and clustering about the hood. I began running along the road. I felt no fear, only a wild, trembling exultation as I ran up the hill towards the monster. Out of the hood hung red shreds, at which the hungry birds now pecked and tore.
I scrambled up to the crest of Primrose hill, the Martian's camp was below me. A mighty space it was, and scattered about it, in their overturned machines, were the Martians, slain after all man's devices had failed by the humblest creatures on the earth: bacteria. Minute, invisible, bacteria. Directly the invaders arrived and drank and fed, our microscopic allies attacked them. From that moment, they were doomed.
The torment was ended. The people scattered over the country, desperate, leaderless, starved, the thousands who had fled by sea including the one most dear to me; all could return, the pulse of life growing stronger and stronger would beat again.
As life returns to normal, the question of another attack from Mars causes universal concern. Is our planet safe, or is this time of peace merely a reprieve? It may be that across the immensity of space, they have learned their lessons , and even now await their opportunity. Perhaps the future belongs not to us, but to the Martians.",Dead London [Early Band Run-Through],1981
Ken Freeman,"For three days I fought my way along roads packed with refugees, the homeless, burdened with boxes and bundles containing their valuables. All that was of value to me was in London. By the time I reached their little red brick house, Carrie and her father were gone.

The summer sun is fading as the year grows old,
And darker days are drawing near,
The winter winds will be much colder,
Now you're not here.

I watch the birds fly south across the autumn sky
And one by one they disappear,
I wish that I was flying with them
Now you're not here.
Like the sun through the trees you came to love me,
Like a leaf on a breeze you blew away...

Through autumn's golden gown we used to kick our way,
You always loved this time of year
Those fallen leaves lie undisturbed now
Cause you're not here
Cause you're not here
Cause you're not here 

Fire suddenly leapt from house to house. The population panicked and ran, and I was swept along with them, aimless and lost without Carrie. Finally, I headed eastward for the ocean and my only hope of survival: a boat out of England.

Like the sun through the trees you came to love me,
Like a leaf on the breeze you blew away...

A gentle rain falls softly on my weary eyes
As if to hide a lonely tear
My life will be forever autumn,
Cause you're not here
Cause you're not here
Cause you're not here

As I hastened through Covent Garden, Blackfriars and Billingsgate, more and more people joined the painful exodus. Sad, weary women, their children stumbling in the street with tears, their men bitter and angry, the rich rubbing shoulders with beggars and outcasts. Dogs snarled and whined, the horse's bits were covered with foam, and here and there were wounded soldiers, as helpless as the rest.
We saw tripods wading up the Thames, cutting through bridges as though they were paper. Waterloo bridge, Westminster bridge, one appeared above Big Ben.

Ulla! 

Never before in the history of the world, had such a mass of human beings moved and suffered together. This was no disciplined march, it was a stampede, without order and without a goal, six million people unarmed and unprovisioned driving headlong. It was the beginning of the rout of civilization, of the massacre of mankind.
A vast crowd buffeted me towards the already packed steamer. I looked up enviously at those safely on board... straight into the eyes of my beloved Carrie. At sight of me she began to fight her way along the packed deck to the gangplank. At that very moment, it was raised, and I caught a last glimpse of her despairing face as the crowd swept me away from her.

True lovers often must part, 
Kiss me, then leave me to sorrow! 
Here love, I give you my heart, 
You will return some glad morrow

But now is the hour when we must say goodbye, 
Soon you'll be sailing far across the sea, 
While you're away, o, then remember me, 
When you return, you'll find me waiting here.",Now Is the Hour (Maori Farewell Song),2007

At the window by the door
Wondering if she'll
Ever smile again
Her eyes filled with memories
And her life in sad array
Unaware of the colours of the day
She dare not cry for fear
Her hope might disappear
But if she cared to try
I know it all could be so clear

But she's living in the past
She didn't know it wouldn't last
And it's a long, long, lonely road
Oh, to go down

The treasured names
You call each other just for fun
And as you woke
She kissed your eyes
You killed it all when it had
Only just begun
What's it take to make you realise

Love isn't easy though
Many like to think it is
But you must learn
To give and take or know

She is the devil in a fancy dress

Ken Hensley,"In the magic garden
Some were singing
Some were dancing
While the midnight moon
Shone brightly overhead

The stars so gaily glistened
And the sphinx in silence listened to
The magician tell of 
Lives that he had led

Let the bells of freedom ring
Songs of love to Friday's king

Let's all go to
The magician's birthday
It's in a forest
But not so far away
Much to do
And so much to say
While we listened to
The orchid orchestra play

Happy Birthay to you 
Happy Birthday to magician 
Happy Birthday to you 

Then at the dead of midnight
As we watched the dancing firelight
The air grew cold
And seemed to dull the flame
The fire died
The music faded
Filled with fear of death we waited
For now we knew
Some evil was to blame

I challenge you
I challenge you all
For all you own
And all you know
And by all the powers of darkness 
I will steal what is mine

Surrender now or face my spite
I grant you it may be Friday night
But did you know this day
Also numbers thirteen

First I'll give you fire
I turn your fire into a sleepy stream
Yes, now I give you nightmares
From your horror I'll create a dream

You cannot fight me
For I have the sword of hate
But one thing you can't see
My answer is simply
An impenetrable fortress
Of love, love, love

The fear went as quickly as it came
The air was clear
The fire burned again
The flames leapt
The organ played
The swans sang
To greet the day
And then we knew that
Love will find love will find love",The Magician's Birthday,2002

And the new day's breakin' through
The morning
Of another day without you
And as the hours roll by
No-one's there to see me cry
Except the sunrise

Tired eyes drift across the shore
Looking for love and nothing more
But as the sea rolls by
No-one's there to see me cry

Ken Hensley,"I didn't see you standing there
You took me by surprise
In your long silk dress
And those deep brown eyes
I was captured by your smile
But when fate put out it's hand
You're walking to your love
How was I to resist
The passion and the kiss
We raised the future alone

She stole my body and soul
With a heart next to mine
I didn't wanna face the day
But I have no choice when we kiss

She said
Goodnight my sweet pretender
Tonight we live forever
One heart, one soul
On the edge of the world
Goodnight my sweet pretender
Feels like we died together
In each others arms
On the edge of the world

When she touched me so warm
And so was her body
A kiss she gave to me
The name she said to pain and pleasure
Time my soul rescue me
But I know I'd be here on my own
As soon as the sun would rise
I didn't wanna face the day
But I have no choice when we kiss

I've dreamed of a place I know
With the shadows of my past
Still remain
You're buried in the midst of time
For always you'll be the sun that shines
Shines on me

Goodnight, goodnight
My sweet pretender ...

Ken Hensley,"Sympathy just doesn't mean
That much to me
Compassion's not
The fashion in my mind
And if you're looking for
A shoulder to cry on
Don't turn your head my way
'Cause I'd rather have
My music any day

You and I are
Masters of our destiny
We look for consolation all the time
Until we find out things are not
What they were meant to be, oh no
And if it doesn't suit our mood
We'll call it crime

Dedication's not an obligation
Or a figment of
Someone's imagination
It's the only way they say
To live from day to day
To make each passing way
A small sensation

The simple man
Reality the fantasy of youth
But living is a problem that
Is common to us all
With love the only
Common road to truth",Sympathy,2002

Morning's sleepy sky
With all the colors of
The sunrise shining in our eyes

One, then another
With a story of yesterday's life
Or of a lover who had
Gone in a moment of strife

No thought of sleep ever dwells
Upon the wise man's mind
Some task or audience
Stealing every moment of his time

Thus we have learned to live
While mortal men
Stand waiting to die
How can we do what must be done
In just one short life

And if you ask
Then you must know
If you still doubt
You should be told
It was not we
That made it so
It was by those
Who went before

And there you sit
Tomorrow's child
So full of love
So full of life
But you must rise
To meet the day
Lest you become another tale

Her long hair flowing in the mid-winter wind.
I know not how she found me, for in darkness I was walking,
And destruction lay around me from a fight I could not win.

She asked me name my foe then. I said the need within some men 
To fight and kill their brothers without thought of men or god.
And I begged her give me horses to trample down my enemies,
So eager was my passion to devour this waste of life.

But she would not think of battle that reduces men to animals,
So easy to begin and yet impossible to end.
For she the mother of all men had counciled me so wisely that
I feared to walk alone again and asked if she would stay.

""Oh lady lend your hand,"" I cried, ""Oh let me rest here at your side.""
""Have faith and trust in me,"" she said and filled my heart with life.
There is no strength in numbers. I've no such misconceptions.
But when you need me be assured I won't be far away.

Thus having spoke she turned away and though I found no words to say
I stood and watched until I saw her black cloak disappear.

Just glad I'm livin' and lucky to be

She'd be so much better off if I went away.

She'd be unhappy without me I know
I got a woman crazy for me

Still she's diff'rent from the rest, satisfied with me.
While I worry plan and scheme, Over what to do
Can't help feeling it's a dream, Too good to be true. 

Never had nothin'; no one to care
That's why I seem to have more than my share,
I got a woman, crazy for me,
She's funny that way.

When I hurt her feelings, once in a while,
Her only answer is one little smile,
I got a woman crazy for me.
She's funny that way.

I can see no other way and no better plan,
End it all and let her go to some better man;
But I'm only human, coward at best

Before the tears of innocence like a hard rain would desend

My people heard the thundering as the iron horse crossed the land
Its echoes drowning out the cries of those who could not understand
My people watched the buffalo dying in the sun
While those tracks of steal lead to the sea, their will be done

Now their blood flows through these rivers and then into our veins
And their hearts are beating louder then all the years of shame
And their blood flows through these rivers just like an endless rain
And their hearts are beating louder then all the years of shame

My people have fought for this land, here and across the sea
Their shadows cast on sacred ground for all enturnity
My people's pride still can soar and dance across this land
You can see it in the eys of every woman, child, and man

Because the blood flows through these rivers and then into our veins
And their hearts are beating louder then all the years of shame
And their blood flows through these rivers just like an endless rain
And their hearts are beating louder then all the years of shame

That you can never quite recall.

And you see Laura on a train that is passing through.
Those eyes how familiar they seem
She gave your very first kiss to you,
That was Laura but she's only a dream.",Laura,1997
Ken McIntyre,"Speak low when you speak, love,
Our summer day withers away
Too soon, too soon.

Speak low when you speak, love,
Our moment is swift, like ships adrift,
We're swept apart too soon.

Speak low, darling speak low,
Love is a spark lost in the dark,
Too soon, too soon,
I feel wherever I go
That tomorrow is near, tomorrow is here
And always too soon.

Time is so old and love so brief,
Love is pure gold and time a thief.
We're late darling, we're late,
The curtain descends, ev'rything ends
Too soon, too soon,
I wait darling, I wait
Will you speak low to me,
Speak love to me and soon.",Speak Low,1997

There's a bouncer standin' at the door
And he don't allow no fights

Between her world and mine

Is as close as we'll come to perfection
We may not see eye to eye

Her daddy was worth a lot
I was brought up the hard way
Had to scrape for every dime I got

And I'm into late night poker games
We're both as different as different as daylight and dark
But love finds us the same

Started to a movie, ended up at a bar

Took a little sip, then spit it on the floor
When I heard Daddy holler from the front door

Every time she looks at me
My heart starts thumping, blood starts pumping
I get weak in my knees

My voice quivers, my body shivers
My vision gets all blurred
Her eyes flutter, my words stutter
I'm just a bundle of nerves

Wrecked my shopping cart, inside Wal-Mart
When she spoke that southern drawl
Smiled at me, wrote down her number
Said, ""Big boy, give me a call""

Tried to play it cool but fell over a stool
As I turned to walk away
Wound up on my back, underneath a rack
Of women's lingerie

I'm a bundle of nerves, get a little disturbed
Every time she looks at me
My heart starts thumping, blood starts pumping
I get weak in my knees

My voice quivers, my body shivers
My vision gets all blurred
Her eyes flutter, my words stutter
I'm just a bundle of nerves

Thought I'd try my luck, so I called her up
She said, ""Let's go out tonight""
Showed up early feeling like John Wayne
But acting like Barney Fife

Wearing nothing but a smile and an itty-bitty towel
She opened up the door
I was floating through the air, when I tripped on a stair
And fell right off the porch

I'm a bundle of nerves, get a little disturbed
Every time she looks at me
My heart starts thumping, blood starts pumping
I get weak in my knees

My voice quivers, my body shivers
My vision gets all blurred

Ken Nordine,"I started out to be the man behind the scenes 
Knowing I was in above my head 
For all that I could see I never saw the truth. 
Now I'm alone. 
  
Heaven only knows how much I'm missing you, 
Knowing I had heaven in my hands. 
  
And there will be tears, 
Tears are mixed with rain. 
Keeper of my flame. 
  
Time and tide is on my side, 
It stands forever. 
There will be nights of love 
And, yes, there will be tears. 
  
I will not sleep tonight. 
There will be tears tonight. 
I will not sleep tonight. 
There will be tears. 
  
The silent telephone, the turning of the key. 
You're still inside of me, I'm not ashamed. 
For all that I can do, I can't forget your face. 
I call your name. 
  
Heaven only knows what I've been crying for, 
What I'm crying for. 
And all I've done to keep this love alive. 
  
Even through my tears, 
Tears are mixed with rain. 
Keeper of my flame. 
  
I will pray you're on my side, 
We stand forever. 
There will be nights of love 
And, yes, there will be tears. 
  
I will not sleep tonight (oh oh). 
There will be tears tonight. 
I will not sleep tonight (oh). 
There will be. 
  
Soon there will be tears 
Rolling down my world. 
Keeper of my flame. 
  
Time and tide is on my side, 
It stands forever. 
There will be nights of love 
And, yes, there will be tears 
  
I will not sleep tonight.

Ken Overcast,"An old cowpoke went riding out one dark and windy day,
Upon a ridge he rested as he went along his way,
When all at once a mighty herd of red-eyed cows he saw,
A ploughin' through the ragged skies
And up a cloudy draw.
Yippee-yi-ay, yippee-yi-o,
The ghost herd in the sky.

Their brands were still on fire and their hooves was made of steel,
Their horns wuz black and shiny and their hot breath he could feel,
A bolt of fear went through him as they thundered through the sky,
For he saw the riders comin' hard
And he heard their mournful cry.
Yippee-yi-ay, yippee-yi-o,
Ghost riders in the sky.

Their faces gaunt their eyes were blurred and shirts all soaked
With sweat,
They're ridin' hard to catch that herd but they ain't caught them yet
'Cause they've got to ride forever on that range up in the sky,
On horses snortin' fire
As they ride on, hear their cry.
Yippee-yi-ay, yippee-yi-o,
Ghost riders in the sky.

As the riders loped on by him he heard one call his name,
""If you want to save your soul from hell a-riding on our range,
Then cowboy change your ways today or with us you will ride
A-try'ng to catch the devil's herd
Across these endless skies.""

The ghost herd in the sky.

above the blue and windy sea.
When I come home to you, San Francisco,

But it's only seven miles to Mary Anne

It's only seven miles to Mary Anne

But it's only five more miles to Mary Anne

And we'd best be movin' faster if we can

For it's only three more miles to Mary Anne

It's only three more miles to Mary Anne
Dan, get up you ornery cuss, or you'll be the death of us
I'm so weary but I'll help you if I can
All right Dan, perhaps it's best that we stop awhile and rest
For it's still a hundred yards to Mary Anne

It's still a hundred yeards to Mary Anne
Late that night the storm was gone and they found him there at dawn
He'd-a made it but he couldn't leave ol' Dan
Yes, they found him there on the plains, his hands froze to the reins
He was just a hundred yards from Mary Anne

Well of all things can it be really
No. Yes. Ho. Hi. Oh my eye!
My mind may be wandering but I confess
I believe it is Old Deuteronomy

Old Deuteronomy's lived a long time
He's a cat who has lived many lives in succession
He was famous in proverb and famous in rhyme
A long while before Queen Victoria's accession
Old Deuteronomy's buried nine wives
And more I am tempted to say ninety-nine
And his numerous progeny prospers and thrives
And the village is proud of him in his decline
At the sight of that placid and bland physiognomy
When he sits in the sun on the vicarage wall
The oldest inhabitant croaks

Today the world is old
You flew away and time grew cold

Ages ago last night?

An airline ticket to romantic places

A telephone that rings but who's to answer?

And candle lights on little corner tables
And still my heart has wings

The ""Ile de France"" with all the gulls around it
The beauty that is Spring's
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me

Silk stockings thrown aside dance invitations

Wild strawb'ries only seven francs a kilo

The waiters whistling as the last bar closes
The song that Crosby sings
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me

Ken Peplowski Quartet,"Why do they think up stories that link my name with yours?
Why do the neighbors chatter all day, behind their doors?
I know a way to prove what they say is quite untrue.
Here is the gist, a practical list of ""donts"" for you.

Don't throw bouquets at me
Don't please my folks too much
Don't laugh at my jokes too much
People will say we're in love!

Don't sigh and gaze at me
Your sighs are so like mine
Your eyes mustn't glow like mine
People will say we're in love!

Don't start collecting things
Give me my rose and my glove.
Sweetheart they're suspecting things
People will say we're in love.

Don't praise my charm too much
Don't look so vain with me
Don't stand in the rain with me
People will say we're in love!

Don't take my arm too much
Don't keep your hand in mine
Your hand feels so grand in mine
People will say we're in love!

Don't dance all night with me
Till the stars fade from above.
They'll see it's alright with me
People will say we're in love.",People Will Say We're in Love,2002
Ken Peplowski Quartet,"Sleep, sleep, sleep
How we love to sleep
At the close of day
When the joys of the day fade away and the memories sweet
Of the day repeat 
In our dreams they creep
While we sleep, sleep, sleep
It seems that daytime was just made for laughter and song
Evening brings romance to lovers as they stroll along
Night time brings rest to the weary
Sooths all the hearts that are dreary
Leaves us alone with our day dreams
Brings back sweet golden love dreams while we sleep, sleep, sleep
How we love to sleep

When the joys of the day fade away and the memories sweet
Of the day repeat 
In our dreams they creep

Never tell me dreams come true
Just try it and I'll start a riot

Ever tell me he will care

I never want to hear from any cheerful Pollyannas
Who tell you fate supplies a mate
It's all bananas

They're writing songs of love but not for me
A lucky star's above but not for me
With love to lead the way I've found more clouds of gray
Than any Russian play could guarantee

I was a fool to fall and get that way
Hi-ho, alas, and also lack-a-day
Although I can't dismiss the memory of his kiss

In everything that's light and gay

I'm as jumpy as a puppet on a string
I'd say that I had spring fever
But I know it isn't spring

I am starry-eyed and vaguely discontented
Like a nightingale without a song to sing
Oh, why should I have Spring fever
When it isn't even spring?

I keep wishing I were somewhere else
Walking down a strange new street
Hearing words that I have never heard
From a girl I've yet to meet

I'm as busy as a spider spinning daydreams
I'm as giddy as a baby on a swing
I haven't seen a crocus or a rosebud or a robin on the wing

Love was a star, a song unsung
Life was so new, so real so right
Ages ago last night

Today the world is old
You flew away and time grew cold
Where is that star that shone so bright
Ages ago last night?

To think that spring had depended
On merely this, a look, a kiss
To think that something so splendid
Could slip away in one little daybreak

I was kissed by my sisters, my cousins, and my aunties.
Sad to tell, it was hell, an inferno worse than Dante's.

So my dear I swore,
""Never, never more!""
On my list, I insisted that kissing must be crossed out.
Now, I find I was blind, and oh my! 
How I lost out!

I could cry salty tears,
Where have I been all these years?
Little wow, tell me now,
How long has this been going on?

There were chills up my spine,
And some thrills I can't define.
Listen, sweet, I repeat,
How long has this been going on?

Oh, I feel that I could melt,
Into Heaven I'm hurled!
I know how Columbus felt,
Finding another world.

Kiss me once, then once more.
What a dunce I was before.
What a break!

And if another love should find my heart
It will remind my heart of your goodbye

With every new love you
Will come back to me
In others eyes, its you I see
If I love again
Though its someone new

If I love again
It'll still be you
In someone else's firm embrace
I'll close my eyes but see your face

If I love again
I'll find other charms
But I'll make believe, you are in my arms
And though my lips whisper

""I love you""
My heart will not be true
I'll be loving

A beautiful theme of every
Dream I ever knew.
Down deep in my heart I hear it play.
I feel it start, then melt away.

I hear music when I touch your hand,
A beautiful melody
From some enchanted land.
Down deep in my heart, I hear it say,
Is this the day?

I alone have heard this lovely strain,
I alone have heard this glad refrain:
Must it be forever inside of me,
Why can't I let it go,
Why can't I let you know,
Why can't I let you know the song
My heart would sing?

That beautiful rhapsody
Of love and youth and spring,
The music is sweet,
The words are true 
The song is you.",The Song Is You,2007
Ken Snyder,"She's got that dark hair falling 'cross her shoulders
There's not a man alive that wouldn't want to hold her
And the way she moves, just the way she moves
Well, that's enough to keep me on a slow burn
Keep me on a slow burn

In her high heals kicking 'cross the dance floor
She's more woman than I could ever ask for
Still there's something in her eyes, in those dark eyes
That's love and that keeps me on a slow burn
Keeps me on a slow burn

When we touch this fire breaks out
And it rages out of control
And the love we made is so deep, so strong
And when it's over, even when it's over
And the flame dies down
It just dies down to a slow burn, slow burn

And the love we made is so deep, so strong
That when it's over, even when it's over
And the flame dies down
It just dies down to a slow burn, a slow burn
A slow burn, slow burn

She's got that dark hair falling 'cross her shoulders
Keeps me on a slow burn
In her high heals kicking 'cross the dance floor
Keeps me on a slow burn
When we touch, when we touch

Ken Song,"Black cats creep across my path
Until I'm almost mad
I must have 'roused the devil's wrath
Cause all my luck is bad
I make a date for golf and you can bet your life it rains
I try to give a party and the guy upstairs complains
I guess I'll go through life 
Just catchin' colds and missin' trains

Everything happens to me
I never miss a thing
I've had the measles and the mumps
And every time I play an ace
My partner always trumps
Guess I'm just a fool who never looks before he jumps

Everything happens to me
At first my heart thought you could break this jinx for me
That love would turn the trick to end despair
But know I just can't fool this head that thinks for me
I've mortgaged all my castles in the air
I've telegraphed and phoned
I send an ""Airmail Special"" too
Your answer was ""Goodbye""
And there was even postage due
I fell in love just once
And then it had to be with you

Hearing guitars like someone in love.
Sometimes the things I do astound me,

Que la vida podría fallarme alguna vez

Saque la puntuación mas alta en el amor
Sin ti de nada vale

Tengo un gran conocimiento
Yo mas que eso tengo un doctorado
Tengo el corazón graduado en sentimiento
Con la nota que jamas nadie a alcanzado

Tengo mis sueños contigo
Todo lo que se tu me lo has enseñado
Nada de lo que yo conozco es fingido

Todo lo que tengo
Mas o menos lo perdí

No se como hacer sin ti
Teniendo todo o nada
Me queda sin ti
De que me vale (de que me vale)
Si tu no estas aquí a mi lado de nada me vale

No se como hacer sin ti
Teniendo todo o nada me queda sin ti

De nada me vale

Si esta sólito ya no tiene reina
Para que vivir hacia sufrido
Si tengo tantas ganas de vivir
Y muero de amor

Teniendo todo o nada me queda sin ti
De que me vale

De nada me vale

Pero de repente todo cambio 
Ya no eras la misma cuando haciamos el amor 
Hoy me pides que me vaya sin ninguna razon 
Tu no sabes cuanto daao le hace a mi corazon, perderte 

Dime como olvidarte 
Si no quiero alejarme 
No me pidas que me vaya, no 
(Que no me vaya no) 
(Que no me vaya no) (no) 
Que no ves que ya no puedo 
Que sin ti me desespero 
(Muaecatu eres la razon que yo hago) 
(Todo esto es la razon que Yo trabajo tan duro) 
No me pidas que me vaya, no 
(Yo te quiero dar una vida, diferente) 

Yo te quiero con todo mi corazon 
Pero no entiendo la razon 
Porque siento como tu y yo no somos lo mismo, a lo mejor 
Estamos acostumbrao' 
Y no estamos enamorao' 
O maybe es algo que da duro 
Y viene y se va como un morao 
Pero mami let's work it out 
Es un daao profundo 
Pensar en los aaos 
Que tu y yo viviamos juntos 
Y que, todos esos aaos se fueron por gusto? (No, no)
No me digas eso mami 
Eso yo no lo puedo aceptar 
Un amor como el nuestro es real 
Un amor tan profundo 
Yo te apuesto el mundo 
Que tu te sientes igual 
Un amor que no se puede olvidar 
Un amor que no se puede ocultar 
Un amor tan rico y tan fuerte 
Que no se puede dudar 

Dime como olvidarte 
Si no quiero alejarme 
No me pidas que me vaya, no 
(Que no me vaya no) 
(Que no me vaya no) (no) 
Que no ves que ya no puedo 
Que sin ti me desespero 
(Muaecatu eres la razon que yo hago) 
(Todo esto es la razon qYo trabajo tan duro) 
No me pidas que me vaya, no 
(Yo te quiero dar una vida, diferente) 

Como pudiste lastimarme 
Si lo unico que hice fue amarte 
Creo que merezco una, explicacion 
Creeme, he tratado de olvidarte 
Y lo unico que he logrado es recordarte 
Dime, como aguantar tanto dolor 
(No, no, no) 

Dime como olvidarte 
Si no quiero alejarme 
No me pidas que me vaya, no 
(Que no me vaya no) 
(Que no me vaya no) (no) 
Que no ves que ya no puedo 
Que sin ti me desespero 
(Pero, pero mamita tu no entiendes?) 
No me pidas que me vaya, no 
(Tu eres la mujer que yo quiero, 
Yo te quiero dar el mundo, yo te adoro 
Hazme el favor y escuchame mamita) 

Dime mami que es lo que tu sientes 
Dime mami que es lo que tu quieres 
Mira mi hija, tu sabes que la vida mia 

Esta en la boca de toda la gente 
Chisme por aqui, chisme por alla 
Yo lo vi por aqui, yo lo vi por alla 
Yo lo vi con esta, yo lo vi con esa 
Entonces yo te llamo y tu no contestas 

Yo te amo, yo te quiero 
Yo te adoro, mi cielo 
Yo quiero, vivir, mi vida, contigo 
Yo te quiero complacer 
Pero dime lo que tengo que hacer, dime 
Yo te quiero complacer 
Pero dime lo que tengo que hacer, dime! 

Dime que debo hacer si la verdad es que no puedo 
Alejarme de ti, olvidarme de ti, mamita yo no quiero 
No me pidas mas que no, no te voy a complacer 
Si todo estaba muy bien 
Dime amor, en que falle!? 
En que falle? 
En que falle? 
En que falle? 

(No, no, no) 

Dime como olvidarte 
Si no quiero alejarme 
No me pidas que me vaya, no 
(Que no me vaya no) 
(Que no me vaya no) (no) 
Que no ves que ya no puedo 
Que sin ti me desespero 
No me pidas que me vaya, no

Mamita te quiero!",Dime [Remix],2006
Ken-Y,"Amigo, ya que al cielo tu haz partido
Solo una cosa a mi Dios yo le pido
Que entre sus brazos te encuentres dormido

Amigo, para nosotros siempre serás amigo
Te haz marchado pues lo quizo el destino
En nuestra mente siempre estarás vivo
Amigo, amigo

Entre llantos y tristezas hoy amigo te despido
Piediéndole al Señor que en sus brazos tu estas dormido
Con mis lágrimas voy recordando todo lo que hicimos
La ocurrencias que hicimos, en el barrio cuando crecimos

Mirando al cielo pido a Dios que te perdone
Siempre te recordaremos en nuestros corazones
Fuistes un amigo en las buenas y en las malas
Siento un dolor tan grande ahora por que te marchas

Amigo,ya que al cielo tu haz partido
Solo una cosa a mi Dios yo le pido
Que entre sus brazos te encuentres dormido

Amigo, para nosotros siempre serás amigo
Te haz marchado pues lo quizo el destino
En nuestra mente siempre estarás vivo
Amigo, amigo

Que es lo que debo hacer para yo conformarme
Si dia a dia lo que hago es recordarte
Quisiera tenerte frente a frente y explicarte
Para que veas cuanta falta tu me haces

Que es lo que debo hacer para yo conformarme
Si dia a dia lo que hago es recordarte
Quisiera tenerte frente a frente y explicarte
Que aunque te hayas ido, tu siempre serás

Amigo, ya que al cielo tu haz partido
Solo una cosa a mi Dios yo le pido
Que entre sus brazos te encuentres dormido

Amigo, para nosotros siempre serás amigo
Ta haz marchado pues lo quizo el destino
En nuestra mente siempre estaras vivo
Amigo, amigo

Ken-Y,"Huh
Las mujeres no son las unicas que tienen sentimientos
Mamita te voy a hablar claro
Yo me siento mal, muy mal
Ken-why, explicales

Ayer me dijistes que me amabas
Que no habria quien nos separara
Que yo era tuyo why tu eras mia
Para nuestro amor no habian medidas
Pero de repente todo cambio
Ya no eras la misma cuando haciamos el amor
Hoy me pides que me vaya sin ninguna razon
Tu no sabes cuanto daño la hare a mi corazón, perderte

Yo te quiero con todo mi corazon
Pero no entiendo la razon
Porque siento como tu why yo no somos lo mismo, a lo mejor
Estamos acostumbrao'
Why no estamos enamorao'
O maybe es algo que da duro
Why viene why se va como un morao
Pero mami let's work it out
Es un daño profundo
Pensar en los años
Que tu why yo viviamos juntos
Why que, todos esos años se fueron por gusto? (No, no..)
No me digas eso mami

Un amor como el nuestro es real
Un amor tan profundo

Ja, ja, ja, ja

Hoy he desperta'o
Acariciando la noticia de que tú no volverás
Desorienta'o, dando vueltas en mi cama
Pensando si me amas, yo que te he ama'o
Como nadie, como loco, amores como el mío pocos hay
Duermo solea'o, rocha'o porque te has marcha'o
Y hoy desperté en la misma casa, en el mismo cuarto
En la misma cama en donde te ame
Y eso me pone down, down

(Down!) Si no tengo de tu piel
(Down!) Si no tengo tu calor
(Down!) Si no tengo tu querer
Si no tengo de tu amor
Mami, yo me pongo down
(Down!) Girl, I'm dying for your love
(Down!) I can't handle it anymore
Si no tengo tu querer
Si no tengo de tu amor
Girl, that makes me feel so down
So down
That makes me feel so down

Ja, ja, ja, ja
(Héctor) mami yo estoy down y por tu amor
Trastorna'o en las noche lloro como un mamao
Con cuantas gatas yo eh basila'o pero a cada
Pichón le llega su guaragua'o casi ni duermo
De tus labios enfermo como un ni~o si le quitan su
Telmo y mas enfermo con to lo que ah pasao
Las escapas y las chotias del cuñao
Y yo empezao con dormir a tu lao
Y devorarte mami de un bocao aun que me
Tengan el nombre dañao si go down! y por tu amor

Girl, can't you see
Que yo no puedo vivir sin ti
And my life is going down
Porque no te tengo aquí
Porque no estas junto a mí
Oh, baby
Girl, can't you see
Que yo no puedo vivir sin ti
And my life is going down
So down
Porque no te tengo aquí
Porque no estas junto a mí
Oh, baby
You make me feel so down

Desorienta'o, en llanto desperté
Acariciando la noticia de no tenerla a usted
Entiéndanme, los hombres también lloran
Y más cuando se va la persona que mas adoran
Estoy en baja, down, ya no tengo ni palabras
Pensando en ti, dando vueltas en la cama
No es fácil vivir la agonía
De pensar en ti noche, mañana, y día
Estoy muriendo, sufriendo, yo te hago entender
Este amor yo te lo juro quise defender
Pero todo fallo en todos los intentos
No aguanto la agonía y este sufrimiento

(Down!) Si no tengo de tu piel
(Down!) Si no tengo tu calor
(Down!) Si no tengo tu querer
Si no tengo de tu amor

Es que no puedo aguantar, las ganas de amarte
Y de besarte igual que ayer, igual que ayer

Yo te confieso que yo te extraño

Mis heridas, desde que tu te fuiste mi

Fallado te pido perdón, solo te pido que

Al igual que yo, yo se que usted también En mi cama y en mis brazos quieres amanecer Los dos desnudos, yo te beso y te acaricia la brisa Y al fin de la jornada encontrar una sonrisa De satisfacción por lo que tú y yo hicimos Mientras que la luna mira y se hace la testigo De los gritos que tú hacías sintiendo placer Me matan las ganas de yo volverla a ver Usted es la señora que me mata si me mira Y me vuelve loco si al oido me suspira Oyendo los gemidos solos del sexo intenso En la oscuridad del cuarto En un silencio inmenso
Pero dale que hoy Vamos a hacerlo sin miedo Hoy vamos a romper el hielo Hoy ya que la noche es perfeccta Vamos a hacerlo hasta que amanesca [ From: http://www.metrolyrics.com/me-matas-lyrics-rakim-y-keny.html ] Hoy vamos hacerlo sin miedo Hoy vamos a romper el hielo Hoy ya que la noche es perfecta Vamos a hacerlo hasta que amanesca

Del corazon ma' y de la conciencia
En la que ni se olvida y el otro pide pasiencia
No aguanto las ganas de amarte porfavor regresa

Por ahi comentan que ella raya la locura
Es que eres tu causante de mi amargura
Que ando loco sin grupirme la tadura
He pedido los sentidos, he perdido coldura

Dimelo tu como hacer
Como borrar de mi el ayer
Dimelo tu como olvidar
Que fuiste mia y ya no lo seras

Como olvidar esa forma de besar
Ma tu te fuiste y yo no puedo pensar
Voy pa la calle y no me siento normal
Porque te fuiste con aquel animal?

No se cuanto tiempo tengo que esperar
Pa estar contigo y ocupar el lugar
Que aquel no pudo yo no vengo ha jugar
Yo si te quiero el te va maltratar

Siempre que te veo yo enloquesco

Miro ha todos lados y ahy te veo

Todavía pasa el tiempo why no la olvido why

Que yo no me merezco esta condena Que me lleve su
Recuerdo en las venas why hoy es su ausencia quien
Me envenena

Dejado de extrañar Que me muero porque ya
No esta why que siempre la voy a esperar hasta el
Dia en que vuelva Que vuelva... Que vuelva...
Que vuelva...

Dejado de extrañar Que me muero porque ya
No esta why que siempre la voy a esperar hasta el
Día en que vuelva? Si la ves Dile que aun
La quiero why que estoy desesperado Porque vuelva
Junto a mí Si la ves Dile que no la he
Olvidadoooo why que lloro como un niño desde
Que se fue de aquí...

Just yesterday you said you loved me
That there was nobody else above me
That I was yours and you were mine
But the words don't image you to fine
But then you had put our love on hold
When it came to making love it wasn't you anymore
Now your telling me to leave I got walk out the door
Cant you see that this is killing me its hurting my soul (oh baby)

How am I supposed to leave you
When my heart tells me to keep you
How can you ask me to Let you Go
(No I just cant let you go)
Cant you see I'm slowly dyin
But Im gunna keep on tryin
Please dont ask of me to let you go

(pitbull)
Let me start by telling you I love you wit all my heart
But I cant understand the reason
Girl you and me were supposed to be for ever and ever
Now instead of being in love like we used to eachother
How could we do this to eachother
We used to ride for eachother
Die for eachother
Cry for eachother
Now its like all of us wanna say bye to eachother
I cant let this happen
I refuse to lose you
I love you baby
It's the truth as usual
I wanna make you happy
Girl its hard to see
That your the world to me
We've been through it all
Thick and Thin
Right Or Wrong
I cant let you go
Because this love is to strong

How am I supposed to leave you
When my heart tells me to keep you

Cant you see I'm slowly dyin
But Im gunna keep on tryin
Please dont ask of me to let you go

Look baby just do what you want
Look baby just take what you need
Look baby I know we're far from perfect
With the game with the money
They could take it its worthless
I know its hard to deal with my life
I know its hard to deal with all the gossip
I've seen her with this I've seen him with that
But everything you said was a manotness
Cant you hear my voice
Mami your my heart my soul my love
And I swear to you baby
I just wanna give you my heart my soul my love
I know we could work this out
I know we can
Baby lets try
But the one thing I wont do
Is let this love down (fading echo)

How am I supposed to leave you
When my heart tells me to keep you
How can you ask me to Let you Go

Cant you see I'm slowly dyin

Please dont ask of me to let you go

Dime, I'm tryin to let you go
But the only thing I'm gettin is all this crying

Gracias

Hola Soy Yo
De verdad estoy llamando para decirte que
Lo nuestro no puede continuar, espero que puedas entenderlo
Y que algun dia me puedas perdonar

Hoy a terminado el amor de los dos
Quisas amarte tanto , ese fue mi error
Hoy no sentiras nada , pero pronto veras
Que el amor que te di nadie lo igualara
Te marchas para siempre sin explicacion
Y entre tus maletas , mi corazon
Te vas sin decir nada sin importarte mi dolor
Pero se que algun dia sentiras lo que yo

Y lloraras
Y te recordaras
De aquellos bellos momentos que solo conmigo as de pasar

Y lloraras
Y te arrepentiras, si
Cuando te sientas sola , con ganas de amar
Lloraras

Te marchas para siempre sin explicacion
Y entre tus maletas, mi corazon
Te vas sin decir nada sin importarte mi dolor
Pero se que algun dia sentiras lo que yo

Y lloraras
Y te recordaras
De aquellos bellos momentos que solo conmigo as de pasar

Y lloraras
Y te arrepentiras, si
Cuando te sientas solas, con ganas de amar
Llorarasss

Cuando beses otros labios y, no
Sientas en calor que sentias conmigo
Cuando veas que ya no hay marcha atras
Vas a querer regresar, y muy tarde sera

A veces no sirve el amor sin ser conrespondido
Te llevas mi corazon en pedazos partido
No me diga que el tiempo que pasamos se a perdido
Solo recuerda los momentos bellos que hemos vividos
Vas a llorar, cuando quieran besarte recordaras los momentos que tu Solias amarme
Vas a sentir lo que yo estoy sintiendo
Este dolor tan grande que me esta matando aqui adentro.

Y lloraras
Y te recordaras
De aquellos bellos momentos que solo conmigo as de pasar

Y lloraras
Y te arrepentiras, si
Cuando te sientas sola, con ganas de amar
Lloraras",Llorarás,2008
Ken-Y,"En el silencio yo, vivo pensando en ti
En todas las herida que un día yo te di
Why se también que tu suspiras hoy por mi
El orgullo te mata why no te deja ni vivir

Oye mi vida en que fallamos?
Tu me dices te quiero mientras yo digo te amo
Tus amigos aconsejan no regreses
Why dicen que andarás en una perse
Los errores los estoy pagando fuerte
Pero la oportunidad se la merece
El orgullo te va a matar
Why a mi la culpa me va acabar
Me pides tiempo para sanar
Why el tiempo a ambos nos va alejar

En el silencio yo vivo pensando en ti
Why se que tu también vives pensando
Te propongo analicemos
Para que matarnos cuando nos queremos
Cuando nos queremos

Dime mi vida en que fallamos?
Tu me dices te quiero mientras yo digo te amo

Ya ni mis cartas te importa
Why mis mensajes se agotan gota a gota
Mis amigas dicen que tengo el alma rota
Why que tal vez andas buscándome en otras
Como un idiota

El orgullo te va a matar
Why a mi la culpa me va acabar
Me pides tiempo para sanar
Why el tiempo a ambos nos va alejar

Yo te repito otra vez de nuevo
No dejes que el orgullo te lleve en este juego
Te propongo analicemos
Para que matarnos cuando nos queremos
Cuando nos queremos

Dime mi vida en que fallamos?
Tu me dices te quiero mientras yo digo te amo
I love you but it hurts
I love you but it hurts
Me duele",En Que Fallamos,2008
Ken-Y,"En esta única canción los limites no hacen parte
Por eso hoytres mentes distintas se unen en lo mas débil
Rindiéndose a los pies de quien nos robó le corazón

Mi amor es pobre no tiene casa ni dinero
Camina por las calles del corazón tuyo
Pidiendo como un limosnero
Ámame por favor ábreme el corazón
No ves que me mata el silencio mientras callas
No se como pedirte mas que no te vayas

Si tu me has visto cerquita del corazón tuyo
Es porque a tu lado construyo
Una casita pa vivirla mientras poco a poco sufro y me destruyo
Amarte a ti es mi pasatiempo
El tuyo es irte como el viento
Ignorando mis sentimientos mientras yo muriendo
Quedo en la nada

Me hice promesas yo mismo me juré olvidarte
Y no tuve fuerzas
Solo las tengo para amarte
Amame por favor o arrancame el corazón
No ves que me mata el silencio mientras callas
No se como pedirte mas que no te vayas

Si tu me has visto cerquita del corazón tuyo
Es porque a tu lado construyo
Una casita pa vivirla mientras poco a poco sufro y me destruyo
Amarte ya es mi pasatiempo el tuyo irte como el viento
Ignorando mis sentimientos mientras yo muriendo
Quedo en la nada

Ya tengo débil el corazón
Un día al menos los ojos llenos de lagrimas hay amor

Si tu me has visto cerquita del corazón tuyo
Es porque a tu lado construyo
Una casita pa' vivirla mientras poco a poco sufro y me destruyo
Amarte a ti es mi pasatiempo (pasatiempo)
El tuyo es irte como el viento 
Ignorando mis sentimientos mientras yo muriendo
Quedo en la nada

No existe fortuna fama o placer
Que se compare por lo que sentimos
Por lo mas hermoso del universo la Mujer
Solo los mejores nos unimos
Para expresar lo que sentimos

Y que te diga todo al oido 
Que te quiere 

Por que el te fallo 
Te engaño te traiciono

Buscando en otra el amor

Se que no quieres

Que te asombre

Robar tu corazón y sanar tu cicatriz 
El llevarte de cruzero 
Y en el medio del mar 
Poderte acariciar y poderte besar 
Decirte al oido que mi amor es sincero 
Y que por ti daria todo lo que tengo 
Y mi dinero 
A veces no te encuentro y me desespero 
Por que siento que si no estas a mi 
Lado me muero 

Ya no llores mas 
Por un amor que mal 
Te dejo llorando y sufriendo 
El amor se va otro llegara 
Gota que baja va subiendo 
Y no pasaras mas la vida 
Solita sola llorando 
Yo te hare feliz 
Quedate a mi lado

Talk to her, Frankie

Just yesterday you said you loved me
That there was nobody else above me
That I was yours and you were mine
That there was no limits to our skies
But then you had to put our love on hold
When it came to making love, it wasn't you anymore
And now you're telling me to leave
I gotta walk out the door
Can't you see that this is killing me?
It's hurting my soul

How can you ask me to let you go?

But I'm gonna keep on trying
Please don't ask of me to let you go

By telling you I love you with all my heart
But I can't understand the reason
When you tell me you're leaving

It's like we are used to each other
How could we do this to each other?

But everything they say is monotonous

And I swear to you, baby
I just want to give you my heart, my soul, my love

Déjame tenerte a toda hora
Y ahora deja que yo sea tu hombre

Baby no llores que llego
Otra vez tu combinación favorita
El dúo del Sex con el dúo romántico
Con los Reyes del Mambo

Lloras, yo se porque lloras
Porque yo tengo a mi señora
Y tu a las noches duermes sola
Cada día mas tu te enamoras

Y tu pensando en el y yo pensando en ti
Desesperada y sin ganas mami de vivir
Tal vez porque no te corresponda a ti
Y tu no quieres una vida asi 

Y tu pensando en el y yo pensando en ti
Desesperada y sin ganas mami de vivir
Tal vez porque no te corresponda a ti
Y tu no quieres una vida así 

Vamos a dejar las cosas claras
Oye Pina, hay un comunicado
que la fama tiene mi nombre Ok
Jajaja No estamos jugando
Con los reyes del mambo,
Mambo Kingz

Oye Rakim & Ken-y

Ken-Y,"Hoy pienso en aquel 19 de abril
Cuando delante de todos te prometí,
Que la vida podría fallarme alguna vez
Pero que pasaría el tiempo junto a ti
Lo tengo todo mas de lo que un día pensé
Pero sin ti no tengo na
No se que hacer
Saque la puntuación mas alta en el amor
Sin ti de nada vale

Tengo un gran conocimiento
Yo mas que eso tengo un doctorado
Tengo el corazón graduado en sentimiento
Con la nota que jamas nadie a alcanzado

Tengo mis sueños contigo
Todo lo que se tu me lo has enseñado
Nada de lo que yo conozco es fingido

Todo lo que tengo
Mas o menos lo perdí

No se como hacer sin ti
Teniendo todo o nada
Me queda sin ti
De que me vale (de que me vale)
Si tu no estas aquí a mi lado de nada me vale

No se como hacer sin ti
Teniendo todo o nada me queda sin ti
De que me vale
Los mil diplomas mil honores
De nada me vale

Vivo enamorado y loco
Yo sin ti vivo fracasado y loco
Si tu no estas aquí,
Aquí a mi lado de nada vale ya
Lo que se y mi doctorado

Vivo enamorado y loco
Yo sin ti vivo fracasado y loco
Si tu no estas aquí,
Aquí a mi lado de nada vale ya
Lo que se y mi doctorado

Para que quiero un castillo
Si esta sólito ya no tiene reina
Para que vivir hacia sufrido
Si tengo tantas ganas de vivir
Y muero de amor

No se como hacer sin ti
Teniendo todo o nada me queda sin ti
De que me vale

Si tu no estas aquí a mi lado
De nada me vale

No se como hacer sin ti
Teniendo todo o nada me queda sin ti
De que me vale

Los mil diplomas mil honores
De nada me valen

Vivo enamorado y loco
Yo sin ti vivo fracasado y loco
Si tu no estas aquí,
Aquí a mi lado de nada vale ya
Lo que se y mi doctorado

Vivo enamorado y loco
Yo sin ti vivo fracasado y loco
Si tu no estas aquí,
Aquí a mi lado de nada vale ya
Lo que se y mi doctorado

Vivo enamorado y loco
Yo sin ti vivo fracasado y loco
(que esta canción quede marcada
Para 100pre aunque no te pueda ver)
Si tu no estas aquí
{Mambo Kings) aquí a mi lado de nada vale ya

(Nosotros si que tenemos un doctorado en esto)
