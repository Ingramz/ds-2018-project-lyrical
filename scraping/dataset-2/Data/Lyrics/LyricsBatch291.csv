I feel the night closing in
There must be some reason
for this mood I'm getting in
Can't get no sleep
Don't know what to do

Every evening after sundown,
as the light begins to fade
I feel so low, but I just don't know
why these blues won't go away

it's time I was moving on.
Oh, well I'm tired of the same old faces,
and I'm sick of the same old names.

Let me tell you about the Texas blues.
I went down south to Dallas,
to hear those cowboys wail.
Came across that Billy Gibbons
ridin' on that ZZ trail.
I just can't lose with the Texas blues.
I said I just can't lose with the Texas blues.
The Texas blues.
Got myself in Double Trouble,
when I saw that Texas Flood.
Stevie said The Sky Is Crying,
superstition's in his blood.
I just can't lose with the Texas blues.
I said I just can't lose with the Texas blues.
The Texas blues.
How-how-how-how.
Come on!
I heard that Houston Twister.
He could run you off the tracks.
When he plays that Cold Cold Feeling,
you get the shivers down your back.
I just can't lose with the Texas blues.
I said I just can't lose with the Texas blues.
The Texas blues.
A-how-how-how-how.
Well, I'm going back to Dallas.
Won't go waitin' for no bus.
Ridin' off into the sunset.
You won't see my heels for dust.
I just can't lose with the Texas blues.
I said I just can't lose with the Texas blues.
I said I just can't lose with the Texas blues.
And I just can't lose with the Texas blues.

I understand why I want some more.

You'd better take one last look before I'm out the door. 
There'll be a cold day in hell

Gary Moore,"You wrestle with your conscience 
to free your better self. 
But did you think for one moment 
you could be someone else? 
Between a rock and a hard place, 
is where you seem to be. 
You've been caught in a trap 
between the devil and the deep blue sea. 
All those nights so lonely, 
all the tears that you cry. 
You can't hide 
from the hurt inside. 
(the hurt inside). 
You're in a situation, 
pray this time it will pass. 
But it feels like you're walkin' 
over miles and miles of broken glass. 
Painted into a corner 
where the sun never shines. 
Somebody's turned on the spotlight, 
you forgot to learn your lines. 
In the place you once called your heart 
there's a wound that's open wide. 
You can't hide 
from the hurt inside. 
(the hurt inside). 
When you're thinking 'bout the hard times 
everyone's been through. 
But it won't make no difference, 
seeing things the way you do. 
In this blue condition 
you must search for the light. 
Don't believe them when they tell you, 
you can't hold back the night. 
Between a rock and a hard place, 
is where you'll always be. 
Caught in a trap 
between the devil and the deep blue sea. 
So many words unspoken. 
So many times you never tried. 
You can't hide 
from the hurt inside.

The lonely streets where we embraced. 
Then you would go without a trace. 
Nothing's the same without you. 
Another day goes passing by. 
I sit alone and wonder why. 
Sometimes it's hard, but I will try 
to live my life without you. 
You're in my heart, you're in my dreams. 
You're everywhere or so it seems. 
So many times I've heard that song.

With their shields and their swords.
To fight the fight they believed to be right,
Overthrow the overlords.

To the towns where there was plenty
They brought plunder, swords and flames.
When they left, the town was empty,
And the children would never play again.

Above the battlecry.

There was many more to die.

The friends I left behind me 
I feel a sense of sadness deep inside 
It makes me wonder how I knew 
That one day you would find me 
And what I'd do if you should turn around 
And say goodbye 
 
'Cause baby you 
You're what I'm living for 
I couldn't have asked for more 
Right from the moment that I found you 
I knew that you 
You were my brightest star 
And whether you're close or far 
You're always here inside my heart 
 
'Cause baby you 
You're what I'm living for 
I couldn't have asked for more 
Right from the moment that I found you 
I knew that you 
You were my brightest star 
(You were my brightest star) 
And whether you're close or far 
You're always here inside my heart 
 
Yes, baby you 
You're what I'm living for 
I couldn't have asked for more 
Right from the moment that I found you 
I knew that you 
You were the one for me 
(You were the one for me) 
The one who could make me see 
This world could be a brighter 
This world could be a brighter 
With you this world's a brighter place",You,1979

Wild in the street
With the wind at my back.
Dead, dead on my feet,
But I've just got to make tracks
Straight, straight through your door.
'Cause your love's got me trapped.
Yes, your love's got me trapped.


(You kissed me sweetly.)
Turn the lights down low. (you kissed me sweetly)

Made me lose control. (you kissed me sweetly)

Melt my heart like snow. (you kissed me sweetly)
Standing in your flame,
I'll never be the same.


Under your spell
I don't want to break free.
In your arms I can tell,
That your love hold's the key.
The first time we kissed,
You left me paralysed.
That's when I realized.

",You Kissed Me Sweetly,1979
Gary Morris,"She looked into a heart so sad
And saw what no other ever had
Beneath the snow she saw the spring
She finds good in ev'rything

Give her thorns and she'll find the roses
Give her sand and she'll find the sea
Give her rain and she'll find the rainbows
Just see the love she found in me
Just see the love she found in me

She looks beneath each tear that's cried
And somehow sees the sunny side
And even on the darkest night
She knows where to find the light

Give her thorns and she'll find the roses
Give her sand and she'll find the sea
Give her rain and she'll find the rainbows
Just see the love she found in me
Just see the love she found in me

And when the world starts closin' in
She gives me strength to smile again",The Love She Found in Me,1983
Gary Morris,"As a young boy my mama used to make me walk the line 
But even then as now women were a weakness of mine 
In grade school I was a mess 
Pullin' up some little girl's dress 

Teacher would send me home from school what a witch! 
Mama'd say ""Bad boy, go get me that switch"" 

Chorus: 
Mama you cant' give me no whippin'  
Just for stayin' out all night 
Mama you can't give me no whippin'  
I'm old enough to know wrong from right 
Mama you can't turn me over your knee 
It's embarrassing to a man like me 
Mamma I think I've got something that the girls like 
Mama I think I might have something that the girls like 

I guess I was 'bout thirteen when this feeling came over me 
I started learnin' how to talk the girls out of their virginity 
Sneak 'em out into the light of the moon 
Sneak 'em up into my bedroom 
Mama'd catch us without a stitch and say 
""Bad boy now get me that switch"" 

I remember celebratin' my eighteenth birthday 
I headed out into the evening and I heard Mama say 
""Boy don't cha be late"" 
I rolled in about 4 AM 
Didn't know where I was or were I'd been 
There was Mama with a belt in her hand 
And I said ""Hey! Mama your boy's a man!!""

And I might not be here in the morning light

I might move into Memphis on a fast moving train
Thumbin' down some trucker heading west in the fast lane
But I'll never stop loving you, loving you

Just as sure as that Mississippi flows to the sea
I'll run just as wild, love just as deep
I'll never stop loving you, loving you

Call you from Dallas to tell you what flight I'm on

I might go round the world but I'll come back to you

I would never let you put chains on me
And you never tried in my life

That old moon has never shined as bright as it's shining now on you
I see a new star in the heavens for us tonight
I've been waiting for you most of my life

Now that we're together and we're where we belong
I can't help but wonder why, why did it take so long

Sometimes it takes too much time to find the right one to say
I wanna make you mine, I wanna make you mine
Be with you all the time
And be the only light in your eyes that ever shines

Sometimes it takes too many roads to reach the right one to say
Here's where I wanna be, oh, what you mean to me
When we're making love
I'll spend the rest of my life with you making up for lost time
Making up, making up for lost time

I turn around and get lost in the look that you give to me
I drift away when I hear you say you've only lived to find me
Darling, let me hold you in my arms, darling, oh, so tight
I've been waiting for you most of my life

Now that we're together and we're where we belong
I can't help but wonder why, why did it take so long

Gary Morris,"Once was a woman and once was a man
Who'd never been lovers, just good friends
Both of them happy with rings on their hands
But they'd dreamed of each other, romance

So picture two people alone in a room
Together for the very first time
Candles are burning, holding each other

And picture two people whose dreams have come true
They must be goin' out of their minds
If for only a moment seems like forever

Finishing touches
The canvas set to dry
Each color tells its story
Of where and when and why
Finishing touches

Now no one can know what a love is to life
Till they have to choose one, lose one
And no one can know what a heartache is like
Till they have to break one, take one

Finishing touches
The canvas set to dry
Each color tells its story
Of where and when and why
Finishing touches

Now, there is a woman and there is a man
Who used to be good friends, now they're just lovers
Their dreams of forever must come to an end
And stop all this madness, somehow recover

So picture two people alone in a room
Who finally have made up their minds
Oh, how the tears flow, both know

And picture them holdin' each other real tight
Knowing it's the very last time
They gotta let go, let go

Finishing touches

Each color tells its story
Of where and when and why

Gary Morris,"It must have been cold there in my shadow
To never have sunlight on your face
You've been content to let me shine
You always walked a step behind

I was the one with all the glory
While you were the one with all the strength
Only a face without a name
I never once heard you complain

Did you ever know that you're my hero?
And everything I would like to be?
I can fly higher than an eagle
'Cause you are the wind beneath my wings

It might have appeared to go unnoticed
But I've got it all here in my heart
I want you to know I know the truth
I would be nothing without you

Did you ever know that you're my hero?
And everything I would like to be?
I can fly higher than an eagle
'Cause you are the wind beneath my wings
You are the wind beneath my wings

For so long now
I could never turn my back on you
And just walk out

How could I leave you
When you've been so forgiving?
But living without her love
Don't feel like much like living

Caught between two fires
One is safe and warm
One is pure desire
As the flames raise higher

Either way I turn
I'm gonna get burned
Caught between two fires

Lyin' close beside you
After the love we've made
Another face flickers in my mind
And takes me miles away

I've tried so hard to fight it
But I can't fight anymore
My heart is so divided girl
In this tug of war

Caught between two fires
One is safe and warm
One is pure desire
As the flames raise higher

Either way I turn

And free to love again
Then part of me lets go of you

Keeps givin' into memories
And dreams that won't come true
Sometimes I think I'll never be
Really over you

Dreams die hard
When they don't come true
Dreams die hard
And there's nothing you can do

Dreams die hard
When they take your pride
It's hard to find a new dream
With an old one in your eyes

Sometimes I go a day or two
You don't even cross my mind
I think maybe it's finally true
Gonna leave the past behind

Then I see someone who looks like you
From a window on the street
I know it's not really you
But my heart still skips a beat

Dreams die hard
When they don't come true
Dreams die hard
And there's nothing you can do

Lose the look, you're painted on disguise
Lose the dress, that hides the fairest prize

Lose the time, this time belongs to me
Lose your mind and let the moments be
Lose your all, you're all I'll ever need

On the outside a plain brown wrapper
On the inside solid gold
But the inside's all that matters
And the outside's just for show

Soon the years will surely fade away
Soon the time with lines and shades of gray
Soon the dreams will all be yesterdays

If all that's left is what we're feeling now
All that's changed won't matter anyhow
Rearranged, it's still the same somehow

When the outside's a plain brown wrapper
Still the inside's solid gold
But the inside's all that matters
And the outside was just for show

On the inside's solid gold

Out in the world just like me
Hoping to hear a few
Simple words to believe

And one honest touch is more than enough
For someone with no one to love

And I'm not the kind to give up

Does anybody out there want
A second hand heart
One that's already broken in?
I think I made it through the hardest part
At least enough to try love again

There's a raging fire in me
A perfect match can start
If anybody out there wants

Till someone belongs in my dreams

Fourteen days when she left the man

So baby bye bye

On the inside baby ain't so pretty
Pretty soon she'll find a lonely little world

One less man with his eyes on the ground
And his heart in his hands for the take
No more promises for baby to break

One less man who'll be hangin' 'round

The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Of paradise, where roses grew

Was the most I bargained for
And then I discovered you and in your eyes

Little things of jade
And traffic jams
And anagrams
And bills we never paid,

Were parted by only a slight thing.
I wonder if we did the right thing,

Of rainbows on a wave,
And stockings in the basin
When a fellow needs a shave,

Of tinkling temple bells,
Alma mater yells
And Cuban rum
And towels from
The very best hotels,

Of cushions on the floor,
Hash with Dinty Moore,
That pair of gay pajamas
That you bought
And never wore.

Then I got as high as a steeple,
But we were intelligent people,
No tears, no fuss,
Hooray for us.

Personality problem
He would say things like 'I love you'
And cry real tears

Met him in some place
Like a home for old mothers
Where the cure is always death
But no-one ever leaves

He wore a number 7
Badge on his collar
He would show it with pride
And say 'it means I can feel'

He'd bribe the warders
To send letters to someone
Who didn't even know his name
But said she'd read them anyway

And in the evening (??)
He writes poetry for people
Who deny he's alive
And say 'I'll mention that name'

A violator of the law of no feelings
They should be put in the chair
Until their eyes come in (??)

If you have reasons
I might sell you my time
I'll leave it under the stairs
In a body of mine

Old memories are slowly fading out of me
We are the unknowns, we are all you need

I wonder, I wonder
I wonder, does she call my name?

Don't leave me, don't leave me

Tick tock my heartbeat

Love doesn't come here

But I've seen them before
Look what

Are nothing more than faggots

I vote for words

It's so fortunately arranged
Don't look back
I can assure you that you won't like what you see

You intrude on me
I could whisper
You close in and I'm so uneasy


Hotel rooms, sweet dreams
Like slot machines that call it 'Love love'
A coin in the hole
You young things never stay young for longe


This edge in my voice
But there's really nothing much to say
My conscience mends
I suppose it all meant something to you.

",That's Too Bad [Single Version],1987
Gary Numan,"I'm not so sure 
I still want more of this 
My mind's not quite 
Behaving, I don't know 
I'm not feeling like I'm told I should (???) 

 
  
 

This is my life 
Welcome to me tonight 
I don't feel too 
Glad to be here for sure 
I'm not feeling anymore at all 

This is my head 
This is my face 
It's all my fault 
This is my place 
I don't really think I wanna stay
",This Is My Life,1987
Gary Numan,"Sometimes I feel
I live like a prisoner
But I don't know
If this really is pressure
Surprise you win
I'm lost as screamers roll in
Sometimes I feel
Like leaving this room I'm in

Faded film people dropping words
About the real things to say
? (Not ""Someone pulls me deeper"", as in CD booklet)
And tells me who I will be if I stay
A clever machine writes pretty words
For pretty boys
To sing to us all
We're all so grateful

My face you cry
And I show my darker side
The night is yours
And I just switch off and hide
Cafe and sin
The wine's not to my liking
My face you cry
Oh my didn't I say come in?

Frown (?) in my eyes showing nothing
But surprise about you
And what are you thinking
About my life and her drinking to you too
A dying non-human writes unkind words
For unkind friends
And as for the tears, they'll never show
Asylum people calling on my door
From day to day
The image must fall
I've had my time

Gary Numan,"Listen good
Don't cry for me
Don't cry anymore

Now just shut your mouth
This point of view
Appeals to me

Listen babe
Say you've got no-one tonight

Same old smile
That cracked a thousand hearts
But not mine

Same old line
I've read the book
And I know you well

Listen babe
Say you've got no-one tonight

What's this feeling
That I don't believe
No concern on my face

You dream of something
Like I dreamed of you

Gary Numan,"You and me are old
You and me are young
You and me have always
Let words go unsung


Nothing left to see
Nothing left to do
Nothing left to talk about


How I intrude
This impossible room
I still believe
That great American smile


Nothing's ever right
Nothing's ever wrong
But nothing's ever quite like
The stories and songs (nothing's ever)


Heroes always bleed
But heroes never cry
Heroes always get the best girl
And then die (nothing's ever)


How I intrude
This impossible dream
I still believe
That great American smile

Until you tear yourself apart

You end on reel one
You end on reel one

You quote from 'anxious' and things we do
I need protection from the likes of you

Do you begin to see that I don't know

Send me a card and write 'i think of you'
I'll say you lied, I'll say you're lying

You are, you are

Tell me a secret I'm sure to fall
My dog runs a.w.o.l. I blame you all

In a subway I called 'you'


Hello you no more this talk of
'My boys will be yours'


No more 'I'
This conversation drains
My patience dry.


Here the business always rings twice
No relaxing for the boys tonight

Here the tension always slows twice
Shed one tear it's just routine for now
In a subway I called 'you'

Cold metal rhythm
Takes me back to god

Cold and sane
Know my reason
Know my name

Thank you for nothing
I like this anger
And I won't forget

This isn't love
Its more like a need

And I need the cure

Saw her again in a magazine
Front cover, big star
Showing things that I'd never seen
Well maybe

Can you feel it? Can you?

Who'd believe she'd be so devious
Bad decision, bad move
She told the papers everything
Well maybe

Do you need it, do you?
Do you want it, do you?
Come and get it

She'd only make friends in expensive cars
Television, good wine
Leather seats and a friend of mine
Well maybe

",This Is Emotion,1988
Gary Numan,"Something here
Something is cold and you know
To speak now is to lie
Sad mistake
Maybe it's mine but I know
You wake up with strangers
Is this love
If I said goodbye there would be
No-one to listen
I could ask
""How do you feel?"" but I know
You breathe in emotion

So goodbye
I can't play anymore
So goodbye
I'm off the friendship line
So goodbye
I'm breathing emotion like some hero
Breathe in emotion

I could cry
""Nothing is wrong"" but you know
I don't believe it
I could write
Words on a page but I know
Love doesn't live here
Look at me
Look at my eyes and you'll know
Everything's over
This is me
This is my heart and you know
I breathe in emotion

So goodbye
I can't play anymore
So goodbye
I'm off the friendship line
So goodbye
I'm breathing emotion like some hero
Breathe in emotion

So goodbye
I can't play anymore
So goodbye
I'm off the friendship line
So goodbye

Leaves you junk sick and lonely""

",My Centurion,1994

Can you see her little hands?

Can you hear her little scream?
Can you hear her little cry?

[Chorus]
You have friends and we have reasons
I can't meet you face-to-face
There are no corners to hide in my room
No doors, no windows, no fireplace

My love is only for me
My love needs nobody else
Did you know that my love is a liquid?
I could talk to me for years
I can't speak to you at all
Did you know that friends come in boxes?

Let your body flow inside
Watch it grow before your eyes
Watch it grow before your eyes

On Broadway 
They say there's always magic in the air 
But when you're walkin' down that street
And you ain't have enough to eat
The glitter rubs right off and you're nowhere

They say the women treat you fine
On Broadway 
But lookin' at them just gives me the blues 
How ya gonna make some time
When all you got is one thin dime
And one thin dime won't even shine your shoes
 
They say that I won't last too long 
On Broadway 
I'll catch a Greyhound bus for home they all say

You hurt my reasons to try
I can't forgive you
I will remember
I'll pay you back one cold day.

So I've seen my weakness
And I've seen my heart break
And I've seen you everytime.

So I've heard promises
And I've heard every lie
And I've heard you everytime.

You lied to father
You lied to mother
You lied to brother and me
I used to dream, now
I forget how to
So should I learn how to lie?

You take my picture
You take my ghosts and laugh
You take my reason
You take my soul away.
You take my heartbeat
You take my innocence
You take my dreams and
You'll take my life away.

So now I'm old news
And you would change me
But I'm so tired of this
There is no comfort
In fame when it dies
And I'm so tired of it.

Everything will be decided here
They can read it in the papers.


Your breathing haunts me
My breathing?
The sleeproom still waits for me.


Join the army you can see the world
I remember this one patrol
Been liberating river towns
And we picked up the sex skin crawl.


We would sing the new leader's song
Everyone invented stories
The connection was a fragile thing
Far too many distractions.


I've been listening to the new 'DJ'
What's all this 'original' con?
We all live in the same museum
We all rearrange the same old song.

You're breaking my rules and I won't let you go 

I'm looking for you
(Welcome to me)
Somebody screamed
(It's no use talking)
I've connections with God, what do you need? 

Lost in junk sick
No sleep no motion
She said 'I've nothing to lose'
Love sick? Skin game
Welcome to romance
She's like the heart of the world 

I'm still breathing
Welcome to my house
I'd steal from God wouldn't you?
One more question
Am I in danger?
Rumours, and I've got the fear 

Looking for you
Is it any wonder?
Tearing it up
I'm living on empty",The Skin Game,1994
Gary Numan,"And I have seen wonders
And I have seen miracles
Oh, I have seen some things
It's all lost to me now

And I have seen time run out
I've even seen men cry
It's all lost to me now
Like tears in the rain

And my memories
I can't give them away
So it's easy
Like a long long sleep

I'm so tired
Now it's my time to die

Welcome home

No exhibition
No screaming war songs
No conversation
No more opinions here

What you've been waiting for
We are not
The things you need
We are not

All we are
Here for is right
Room for one more
Here in this room
We play games
Room for one more
Here in this room
You can feel it all
We need it
To keep the shakes away
We need it
To help us breathe
We need it
For everything we feel
We need it

Just leaves us wanting more

Just leaves us cold

Gary Numan,"My confession
I'll steal anything in sight or sound
My confession
This is the sound of fear
And I'll fall down


I don't need it
If you're gonna leave then do it soon
I don't need it
Everything you've ever seen
I've seen before


Leave her to me
Leave her to me


I don't suppose you ever laughed at me
Your fascination leaves me cold
I don't suppose you ever loved at all


I don't need it
I don't need it


If you want it
Every little girl is welcome here


",Your Fascination,1994
Gary Numan,"So I close my eyes and drift into sleep
But something is here
In the dark, in the dream
Like a cruel wind clutching my heart
I feel more than I see
Like a clue to a nightmare that I can't believe
Then it touches me and I try to scream
And a thought tears me inside
And I will do anything
Anything, you understand?
Just to wake up 

Sometimes it almost makes me cry
Sometimes it seems to call my name out loud
Sometimes it feels like I'm alone
And then it comes for me again 

I'm told it's called 'The unreality dream'
I'm told it's called 'The great American lie'
I'm told that this is like the vengeance of God
I can't believe that God would do this to me 

I've known fear many times but nothing like this
I'm so scared I can't breathe
I know I'm asleep but I know this is real
And nothing can help me here
I'm deep inside something and I may never come back
And then it was gone
And then I realized that 'The Rush' brought it in
And I will never sleep alone again 

Sometimes it almost breaks my heart
Sometimes I swear I hear it laugh at me
Sometimes it feels like I could die
And then it leaves my dreams again 

Feels like I'm fighting the possession of my soul
I'm told that this is called 'The sickness of need'
I've got to cut the sex connection and slide
A word of warning to the weary and wise",Deadliner,1994
Gary Numan,"Is this desire
Or a disease? 
If I surrender
Will you come for me? 
Will you come for me? 

Is this your mercy
Or sacrifice? 
No absolution
If you come for me.
If you come for me.

So will I suffer
Humility,
Divine forgiveness,
When you come for me? 
When you come for me",Desire,1994
Gary Numan,"Call me Deadliner

Are you afraid dear listener?
Nothing in here but us.


I'll give you black rumours
'Stay away from everything I've seen.'
I'll give you black rumours
'Stay away from everyone I've been.'


The broken sound of love and lies
Still fill your room.
Faded memories of shame
Will find you soon.


I'll give you corrosion
Miracles are never what they seem
I'll give you corrosion
Welcome to the nightmare, not the dream.


I can remember everything.
Every promise, every lie,
And how the words of strangers made me cry.
All the pride, all the shame,
All the friends that came from nowhere
And then hurried back again.
I collected scars like a man at war
And I thought 'Isn't life peculiar,
Desire takes you there, but not back.'
No more. I'm just another old story.


When God heard your prayer
It said 'I am not your friend.'
Laughed like a fallen angel
And said 'I've no love to send.'


It keeps a photograph
It likes to overdose on time
It said 'Time to leave'
Like other friends of mine.


I'll give you dark wonders
You are all invited to the show.
I'll give you dominions
You are all invited to the show.
I'll give you dead hereos
You are all invited to the show.
I'll give you love and napalm
You are all invited to the show.

Gary Numan,"When I sleep
I slide into
Some heaven
But no one is there.

If I should wonder,
If I forgive

I hear sad words
Songs of god
That show me the lie.

I'll keep you warm and
I'll keep you here,
Alone forever.'

I wonder
If you'll ever think of me.

I won't cry.
I should take
Your picture
From the wall.
This is love
What's it for?
It takes everything.

An hour or two with a friend of mine.
Somebody lied so I burned their soul.
Somebody screamed and the fire burned cold.

I take the pain away.
I cure things, sweet young things.
I soothe the pain away.
I cure things, sweet young things.
I take the pain away.
I cure things, sweet young things.
Like someone walks on their grave.


I booked a small room in a cheap motel.
Somewhere to hide and a cure to sell.
I call it fashion, I'll make them bleed.
No one to love but a ghost to feed.


I was a puppet pulling my own strings.
I can't believe that I did such things.
I was a shadow but god forgives.
Now I'm a priest and Jesus lives.

It could all just burn away

It remains me

By the sound of thinking metal
And I knew something was wrong


I can tell you what fear is
It is the smell of burning
And I'd been close once before


I waited a long time
How I survived God only knows
It seemed like forever
How I survived God only knows
I don't like the memory
How I survived God only knows
How I survived God only knows


I remember the feeling
I'll remember forever
How it all just came apart

I don't believe in a God

Laughed at me
Talked to me
Sheltered me
Fought by me
Lied for me
You lived for me


So call me
And I'll run to you
Ask me
And I'd die for you


You were there
You were always there
Like a friend
Like a lifelong friend
And I love you

And you stole mine

But they're all I can find

Sing my song
Call for me

Gary Numan,"So I wandered like Jesus
Like an alien cure
Searching for my disciples
Dispossessed and alone.

So I looked deeper
Into evil
And I came closer
To your corruption.

I took a virgin like Mary
And said ""I give you The One""
I confessed to desire
And watched the world come undone.

So I looked deeper
Into evil
And I came closer
To your obsession.

So I looked deeper
Into evil
And I came closer
To Heaven.
Your Heaven.

So I moved like a rumour
Like a glorious lie
And I walked into Heaven
Into dead paradise.

I miss your heartbeat
I miss your face and
I miss you

When I'm sleeping,
I dream of you
And I wonder

When I forget,
I call for you

Said 'It's over'
You said 'I'm tired
I can't wait
All my life
I won't cry
Anymore'

I wonder

Remember
How to feel again
And I miss you

In a room like this
There's a knock on the door
And just for a second I thought
I remembered you

So now I'm alone
Now I can think for myself
About little deals
And issues
And things that I just don't understand

Or a sly touch at times
I don't think it meant anything to you

So I open the door

If you are my saviour
Then I'm dead and no one can help me.
If you are my glory
Then I'm sick and no one can cure me.
If you light my darkness
Then I'm blind and no one can see me.

If you are my father
Then love lies abandoned and bleeding.
If you are my comfort
Then nightmares are real and deceiving.
If you are my answer
Then I must have asked the wrong question.
I'd spit on your heaven
If I could find one to believe in.

I should have seen just what was there
And not some holy light
But you crawled beneath my veins

I have no luck
I don't miss it all that much
There's just so many things
That I can't touch

You play a cruel cool game

You leave me calling her name

Personality problem
He would say things like 'I love you'
And cry real tears

Met him in some place
Like a home for old mothers
Where the cure is always death
But no-one ever leaves

He wore a number 7
Badge on his collar
He would show it with pride
And say 'it means I can feel'

He'd bribe the warders
To send letters to someone
Who didn't even know his name
But said she'd read them anyway

And in the evening (??)
He writes poetry for people
Who deny he's alive
And say 'I'll mention that name'

A violator of the law of no feelings
They should be put in the chair
Until their eyes come in (??)

If you have reasons
I might sell you my time
I'll leave it under the stairs
In a body of mine

You were mistaken if you believed
Ruber was someone who'd crumble and leave
Now I am back and I will be staying this time

I told you once and I told you twice
Everything you see before you
Every last bit of it will be mine

",Ruber,1998
Gary Oliver,"Chorus
Come into this house,
Magnify the Lord
Lift up holy hands, our
Hearts in one accord
For He's worthy, worthy
Of all our praise
Stop dissin' just listen,
Let me kick a little slang
Out
I'll tell you all about
Where we power people
Hang out
With power over demons
And anything that's
Wicked
We've trained our brains
To know Christ is the
Ticket
Look plain and simp', the
Devil's a pimp
The power of praise can
Heal your limp
You've been spurned and
Burned by a life with no
Flavor
Bust out of prison with
The risen life Saviour
Chorus
You've been used and
Abused, sold down the
River
I've got news you can
Choose, you need to be
Delivered
With Christ you win,
Without Christ you lose
But if you jam with the
Lamb, you're smooth
Amputation situation first
Cut out the jive, cut into
Church
You need a healin' touch,
A big strong hand
Come rock with the flock
With the brothers that
Jam
Chorus
He's worthy of honor
And glory
Worthy of power
And praise
Worship and bow down
Before Him
Exalt His name today

I didn't believe a single word was true.
I told them all I had faith in you.

Oh, no, not my sweet baby.
You're not like all those other girls 
Who play with man's hearts like they were toys.

That there is truth somewhere 
And you should use your head.""

Like a flower crying
For the dew
That was my heart serenading you
My prelude to a kiss

If you hear a song that grows
From my tender sentimental woes
That was my heart trying to compose
A prelude to a kiss

Though it's just a simple melody
With nothing fancy
Nothing much
You could turn it to a symphony
A Shubert tune with a Gershwin touch

Oh how my love song gently cries
For the tenderness within your eyes
My love is a prelude that never dies
A prelude to a kiss

Though it's just a simple melody
With nothing fancy
Nothing much
You could turn it to a symphony
A Shubert tune with a Gershwin touch

Oh how my love song so gently cries
For the tenderness within your eyes
My love is a prelude that never dies
A prelude to a kiss",Prelude to a Kiss,2000
Gary Peacock,"Somewhere waiting for me
There is someone I'm longing to see
Someone I simply can't help but adore
Someone who'll thrill me forever
Some day my prince will come
Some day I'll find my love
And how thrilling that moment will be
When the prince of my dreams comes to me
He'll whisper, I love you,
And steal a kiss or two
Though he's far away,
I'll find my love some day
Some day when my dreams come true
Some day I'll find my love
Someone to call my own
And I'll know her the moment we meet
For my heart will start skipping a beat
Some day we'll say and do
Things we've been longing to
Though she's far away
I'll find my love some day
Some day when my dreams come true",Someday My Prince Will Come [Live],2003
Gary Peacock,"Yesterday you came my way,
And when you smiled at me,
In my heart I felt a thrill you see,
That it was love at sight and
I was right to love you as I do.
Still I never dreamed that you could love me too.

Your eyes of blue, your kisses too,
I never knew what they could do.
I can't believe that you're in love with me.

You're telling ev'ry one I know
I'm on your mind each place we go
They can't believe that you're in love with me.

I have always placed you far above me.
I just can't imagine that you love me.
And after all is said and done,
To think that I'm the lucky one.
I can't believe that you're in love with me.

Skies are gray. I'm blue each day
When you are not around.
Ev'ry thing goes wrong, my dear I've found
But when you're by my side I fill with pride
For I'm so proud of you
It all seems too good to me to all be true

Your eyes of blue, your kisses too,
I never knew what they could do.
I can't believe that you're in love with me.

Gary Peacock,"Here I go again, I hear those trumpets blow again.
All aglow again, takin' a chance on love.
Here I slide again, about to take that ride again.
Starry-eyed again, takin' a chance on love.

I thought that cards were a frame-up, I never would try.
Now I'm taking that game up and the ace of hearts is high.
Things are mending now, I see a rainbow blending now.
We'll have a happy ending now, takin' a chance on love.

Here I slip again, about to take that trip again.
I got that grip again, takin' a chance on love.
Now I prove again that I can make life move again.
Um - I'm in the groove again, takin' a chance on love.

I walk around with a horse shoe, in clover I lie.
And brother rabbit of course you better kiss your, foot good-bye.
On that ball again I'm ridin' for a fall again.
I'm gonna give my all again takin' a chance on love.",Taking a Chance on Love,2006
Gary Peacock,"The torch I carry is handsome
It's worth its heartache in ransom
Now when that twilight steals
I know how the lady in the harbor feels
When I want rain, I get sunny weather
I'm just as blue, blue as the sky
Since love has gone, I can't get myself together
Guess I'll hang my tears out to dry
My friend ask me out, but I tell them I'm busy
I've got to get a new alibi
I hang around at home, and ask myself, where is she?
Guess I'll hang my tears out to dry
Dry little tear drops, my little tear drops
Moving on a stream of dreams
My little memories, those precious memories
Remind me of our crazy schemes
Then somebody says, just forget about her
But I gave that treatment a try
Strangely enough, I got along without her
Then one day she passed me right by, oh well
I guess I'll hang my tears out to dry",Guess I'll Hang My Tears Out to Dry,2007
Gary Peacock,"Every honey bee fills with jealousy
When they see you out with me

When you're passin' by flowers droop and sigh,
And I know the reason why

Goodness knows
You're my honeysuckle rose

Don't buy sugar
You just have to touch my cup
You're my sugar
It's sweeter when you stir it up

When I'm taking sips from your tasty lips
Seems the honey fairly drips

Gary Peacock,"The night is like a lovely tune
Beware my foolish heart
How white the ever constant moon
Take care my foolish heart

There's a line between love and fascination
That's hard to see, how many names such as this
For they both have the very same sensation
When you're locked in the magic of a kiss

Her lips are much too close to mine
Beware my foolish heart
But should our eager lips combine
Then let the fire start

For this time it isn't fascination
Or a dream that will fade and fall apart
It's love, this time it's love
My foolish heart",My Foolish Heart,2007
Gary Peacock,"I hear music when I look at you,
A beautiful theme of every
Dream I ever knew.
Down deep in my heart I hear it play.
I feel it start, then melt away.

I hear music when I touch your hand,
A beautiful melody
From some enchanted land.
Down deep in my heart, I hear it say,
Is this the day?

I alone have heard this lovely strain,
I alone have heard this glad refrain:
Must it be forever inside of me,
Why can't I let it go,
Why can't I let you know,
Why can't I let you know the song
My heart would sing?

That beautiful rhapsody
Of love and youth and spring,
The music is sweet,
The words are true 
The song is you.",The Song Is You,2007

But who wants to be in love in vain
At night you hang around the hall
And eat your heart out
And cry your eyes out
And rack your brains

Should cause you such misery and pain

Where someone's waiting to be kissed?

Where my heart can go a journeying
Over the shadows and the rain
To a blossom covered lane

Wonderful music, faint as a will o' the wisp
Crazy as a loon, sad as a gypsy serenading the moon

While mortals sleep the angels keep their watch of wondering love
Oh morning stars together, proclaim thy holy birth.
And praises sing to God the king, and peace to men on earth.

A lack of communication, what we have here is

There's no point in fighting
When reasons for staying are missing

I'm leaving
There's something out there that I'm needing
There's more to life, there's got to be more to life

Bouncing off walls of canyons in my mind
Stirring up memories of love long forgotten
How'd we let go of something like that

I stay true to the game
And when the flames were burning slow
I grabbed the torch and let everybody know

What the music, the scene means to me
With pride and sincerity
Handed down by our brothers
Is this our legacy?

I've been around the world and back again
I've had the privilege of watching this grow
Transcend beyond the streets, the clubs, the trends
Beyond anything we had imagined

And slowly turns the page
And carefully picks up the crumbling flower

She closes her eyes and
Touches the house dress that suddenly disappears
And just for the moment she's wearing the gown
That broke all their minds back so many years

Gary Reynolds & The Brides Of Obscurity,"I was sleeping and right in the middle of a good dream
Like all at once I wake up from something that keeps knocking at my brain
Before I go insane I hold my pillow to my head
And spring up in my bed screaming out the words I dread
I think I love you (I think I love you)

This morning I woke up with this feeling
I didn't know how to deal with and so I just decided to myself
I'd hide it to myself and never talk about it
And did not go and shout it when you walked into the room
I think I love you (I think I love you)

I think I love you so what am I so afraid of
I'm afraid that I'm not sure of a love there is no cure for

I think I love you isn't that what life is made of
Though it worries me to say that I never felt this way

I don't know what I'm up against
I don't know what it's all about
I got so much to think about

Hey, I think I love you so what am I so afraid of
I'm afraid that I'm not sure of a love there is no cure for

I think I love you isn't that what life is made of
Though it worries me to say I never felt this way

Believe me you really don't have to worry
I only wanna make you happy and if you say ""hey go away"" I will
But I think better still I'd better stay around and love you
Do you think I have a case let me ask you to your face
Do you think you love me?

It brings back the sound of music so tender
It brings back a night of tropical splendor
It brings back a memory ever green

I'm with you once more under the stars
And down by the shore an orchestra's playing
And even the palms seem to be swaying
When they begin the beguine

To live it again is past all endeavor
Except when that tune clutches my heart
And there we are, swearing to love forever
And promising never, never to part

What moments divine, what rapture serene
Till clouds came along to disperse the joys we had tasted
And now when I hear people curse the chance that was wasted
I know but too well what they mean

So don't let them begin the beguine
Let the love that was once a fire remain an ember
Let it sleep like the dead desire I only remember
When they begin the beguine

Oh yes, let them begin the beguine, please make them play
Till the stars that were there before return above you
Till you whisper to me once more, ""Darling, I love you""

Alone on a hill
The man with the foolish grin
Is keeping perfectly still

Talking perfectly loud

And he never seems to notice

Filling in a ticket in her little white book.

Teach them well and let them lead the way.
Show them all the beauty they possess inside.
Give them a sense of pride, to make it easier;
Let the children's laughter remind us how we use to be.
 
Everybody's searching for a hero;
People need someone to look up to.
I never found anyone who fulfilled my need.
A lonely place to be, and so I learned to depend on me.
 
I decided long ago never to walk in anyone's shadow.
If I fail, if I succeed. 
At least I lived as I believe. 
No matter what they take from me,
They can't take away my dignity.
 
Because the greatest love of all is happening to me.
I found the greatest love of all inside of me.
The greatest love of all is easy to achieve.
Learning to love yourself is the greatest love of all.

I remember long ago another starry night like this
In the firelight Fernando
You were humming to yourself and softly strumming your guitar
I could hear the distant drums
And sounds of bugle calls were coming from afar

They were closer now Fernando
Every hour every minute seemed to last eternally
I was so afraid Fernando
We were young and full of life and none of us prepared to die
And I'm not ashamed to say
The roar of guns and cannons almost made me cry

The stars were bright, Fernando
They were shining there for you and me

There's no regret

I would, my friend, Fernando
If I had to do the same again
I would, my friend, Fernando

Now we're old and grey Fernando
And since many years I haven't seen a rifle in your hand
Can you hear the drums Fernando?
Do you still recall the frightful night we crossed the Rio Grande?
I can see it in your eyes
How proud you were to fight for freedom in this land

Though it's hurting me, now it's history.
I've played all my cards and that's what you've done too,
Nothing more to say, no more ace to play.

The loser standing small beside the victory, that's her destiny.

I figured it made sense, building me a fence,
Building me a home, thinking I'd be strong there,

And someone way down here loses someone dear.
 
The winner takes it all, the loser has to fall,
It's simple and it's plain, why should I complain.
 
But tell me, does she kiss like I used to kiss you,
Does it feel the same when she calls your name.
Somewhere deep inside you must know I miss you,
But what can I say, rules must be obeyed.

Go together like a horse and carriage
This I tell you brother
You can't have one without the other

Love and marriage, love and marriage
It's an institute you can't disparage
Ask the local gentry
And they will say it's elementary

Try, try, try to separate them
It's an illusion
Try, try, try, and you will only come
To this conclusion

Gary Tesca,"And now, the end is near
And so I face the final curtain
My friend, I'll say it clear
I'll state my case, of which I'm certain

I've lived a life that's full
I've traveled each and every highway
But more, much more than this
I did it my way

Regrets, I've had a few
But then again, too few to mention
I did what I had to do
And saw it through without exemption

I planned each charted course
Each careful step along the byway
But more, much more than this
I did it my way

Yes, there were times, I'm sure you knew
When I bit off more than I could chew
But through it all, when there was doubt
I ate it up and spit it out
I faced it all and I stood tall
And did it my way

I've loved, I've laughed and cried
I've had my fill my share of losing
And now, as tears subside
I find it all so amusing

To think I did all that
And may I say - not in a shy way
No, oh no not me
I did it my way

For what is a man, what has he got
If not himself, then he has naught
To say the things he truly feels
And not the words of one who kneels
The record shows I took the blows 
And did it my way",My Way,1996

I want to wake up, in a city that never sleeps
And find I'm king of the hill
Top of the heap

That sly come hither stare
That strips my conscience bare
It's witchcraft

And I've got no defense for it
The heat is too intense for it
What good would common sense for it do

'Cause it's witchcraft, wicked witchcraft
And although, I know, it's strictly taboo

She kissed your eyes
You killed it all when it had
Only just begun

As we dance beside the moon

It's always on my mine
But were did it come from
Our love was the strongest kind
So were can it have gone

Would someone show me the way
To turn my night into day
I'll throw it up around the moon

Our love was the strongest kind
So were can it have gone",When Evening Comes,1973
