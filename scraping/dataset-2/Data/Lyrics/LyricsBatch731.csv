Mike Curb Congregation,"You know, there was a time when
If someone told you to do somethin'
You did it. Bam! Right on! 
No questions asked
It was ""Yes, sir"" and ""Yes, mam""
You never said no. You know? Huh?
But, you know
Things are changing nowadays
It's a new day babies
Folks want to take their own lives into their hands 
And make their own choices
No longer do they want to go along with the program 
'Cause everybody say it's right
You know what I mean?
Let me tell ya what I'm talkin' about, ya see, 'cause...

I don't want no gold watch for workin' fifty years from nine till five
Awhile the boss is guzzling champagne 
And I'm beltin' beer in some dive

'Cause I want to be happy and free
Livin' and loving for me
I want to be happy and free
Livin' and lovin' for me
Like a natural man (Like a natural man)
A natural man (Like a natural man)

Well now, I refuse to listen to people's thinkin' that I live too high
I'm gonna taste it now before my one life streaks on by

'Cause I want to be happy and free
Livin' and lovin' for me
I want to be happy and free
Livin' and lovin' for me",Natural Man,1988
Mike Curb Congregation,"The darkness of my world was all cleared away
The flowers are blooming it's a beautiful day
There's a girl with a heart as big as the sky she's sunshine and I know why
All for the love of sunshine all for the love of sunshine 
The Lord smiled down on this life of mine and sent me the love of sunshine

Though sunshine can always make my days seem bright
Sunshine can warm up a cold cold night
I know my sunshine was sent from above an angel that's filled with love
All for the love of sunshine

Through winter the springtime the summer and fall
The moonlight the starlight she outshines them all
In a world filled with fear with pain and such harm my sunshine can be so warm
All for the love of sunshine
All for the love of sunshine
All for the love of sunshine",All for the Love of Sunshine,1990
Mike Curb Congregation,"Sometimes the world is a valley of heartaches and tears
And in the hustle and bustle, no sunshine appears
But you and I have our love always there to remind us
There is a way we can leave all the shadows behind us
Volare, oh oh
Cantare, oh oh oh oh
Let's fly way up to the clouds
Away from the madd'ning crowds
We can sing in the glow of a star that I know of
Where lovers enjoy peace of mind
Let us leave the confusion and all disillusion behind
Just like birds of a feather a rainbow together we'll find
Volare, oh oh
Cantare oh oh oh oh
No wonder my happy heart sings
Your love has given me wings
(repeat)",Volare,1990
Mike Curb Congregation,"Now they say don't go on Wolverton Mountain if you're looking for a wife
Cause Clifton Clovers has got a pretty young daughter
And he's mighty handy with a gun and a knife
Her tender lips are sweeter than honey and Wolverton Mountain protects her there
The bears and the birds tell Clifton Clovers if a stranger should wander there
All of my dreams are on Wolverton Mountain I want his daughter for my wife
I'll take my chances and I'll climb his mountain
Though Clifton Clovers he may take my life
Her tender lips

I'm goin' up on Wolverton Mountain cause it's too lonesome down here below
It's just ain't right to hide his daughter from the one that loves her so
Her tender lips

I don't care about Clifton Clovers I'm gonna climb up on that mountain
I want to just the one I love I don't care about Clifron Clovers
I'm gonna climb up on that mountain",Wolverton Mountain,1991
Mike Curb Congregation,"Rainin' in my heart
Since we've been apart
I know I was wrong
Baby, please come home

You got me cryin'
'Bout to lose my mind
Don't let me cry in vain
Try my love just once, again

Honey, I need your love
Darlin', you know why
If you would come back home
There'll be no need for me to cry

Raining in my heart
Since we been apart
I know I was wrong
Baby, please come home",Rainin' in My Heart,1995
Mike Curb Congregation,"The news is out all over town that you've been seen out runnin' around
I know that I should leave but then I just can't go you win again
This heart of mine could never see what everybody knew but me
Just trusting you was my great sin what can I do you win again
I'm sorry for your victim now cause soon his head like mine will bow
He'll give his heart but all in vain and someday say you win again
You have no heart you got no shame you take true love and give the blame
I guess that I should not complain I love you still you won again
I love you still you won again",You Win Again,1995
Mike Curb Congregation,"Your cheatin' heart,
Will make you weep,
You'll cry and cry,
And try to sleep,
But sleep won't come,
The whole night through,
Your cheatin' heart,
Will tell on you

When tears come down,
Like falling rain,
You'll toss around,
And call my name,
You'll walk the floor,
The way I do,
Your cheatin' heart,
Will tell on you

Your cheatin' heart,
Will pine some day,
And crave the love,
You threw away,
The time will come,
When you'll be blue,
Your cheatin' heart,
Will tell on you

When tears come down,
Like falling rain,
You'll toss around,
And call my name,
You'll walk the floor,
The way I do,
Your cheatin' heart,
Will tell on you.",Your Cheatin' Heart,1995
Mike Curb Congregation,"When a star is born
They possess a gift or two
One of them is this
They have the power to make a wish come true

When you wish upon a star
Makes no difference who you are
Anything your heart desires will come to you

If your heart is in your dream
No request is too extreme
When you wish upon a star
As dreamers do
Fate is kind

She brings to those who love
The sweet fulfillment of their secret longing

Like a bolt out of the blue
Fate steps in and sees you through
When you wish upon a star
Your dreams come true

When you wish upon a star
Makes no difference who you are
Anything your heart desires will come to you

If your heart is in your dream
No request is too extreme
When you wish upon a star
As dreamers do
Fate is kind

She brings to those who love
The sweet fulfillment of their secret longing
Like a bolt out of the blue
Fate steps in and sees you through
When you wish upon a star
Your dreams come true",When You Wish upon a Star,1995
Mike Curb Congregation,"When I find myself in times of trouble, Mother Mary comes to me
Speaking words of wisdom, let it be
And in my hour of darkness she is standing right in front of me
Speaking words of wisdom, let it be
Let it be, let it be, let it be, let it be
Whisper words of wisdom, let it be

And when the broken hearted people living in the world agree
There will be an answer, let it be
For though they may be parted, there is still a chance that they will see
There will be an answer, let it be
Let it be, let it be, let it be, let it be
There will be an answer, let it be
Let it be, let it be, let it be, let it be
Whisper words of wisdom, let it be
Let it be, let it be, let it be, let it be
Whisper words of wisdom, let it be

And when the night is cloudy there is still a light that shines on me
Shine until tomorrow, let it be
I wake up to the sound of music, Mother Mary comes to me
Speaking words of wisdom, let it be
Let it be, let it be, let it be, yeah, let it be
There will be an answer, let it be
Let it be, let it be, let it be, yeah, let it be
Whisper words of wisdom, let it be",Let It Be,1999

Who calmed the sea
Take a look at yourself
And you can look at others differently
Put your hand in the hand of the man
From Galilee

My momma taught me how to pray
Before I reached the age of seven
When I'm down on my knees
That's when I'm closest to heaven
Daddy lived his life, two kids and a wife
Well you do what you must do
But he showed me enough of what it takes
To get me through, oh yeh!

Just one more time, from 'Stix N Stonz'

It's the M I K E, ohh, to the D
I'm comin' exquisite and V.I.P.
Tryin' to spread some love like roots on a tree
Stayin' true to this vision in the Y2G

Two G's got 'em scratchin' it like the fleas
And Ad Rock got it locked like a crooked cop
Now, it's Ad Rock, y'all remember me
The guy ya bit ya style from off the TV

I score Mmmma-Zah-Ayy's all day
My essays are felt worldwide
We like four planets on the mic
Aligned arrays retired all in the days
Game, too blam for these lames
(Baby, baby)

When I was nine, I played with slime
Got rhymes ga-lot, got rhymes ga-limes
I got a million like rhymes leavin' ya stung
I got my own crew called the nasal tongue

Yo take a few of these be-boys and call me in the mornin'
(Okay)
Keep it on the crusty eye, bagel with some butterflies
Spit gritty like we in MCA's voice box
Y'all bull and my ox don't fit the mix

(Disc jock)
It be some classic material kid
(Disc jock)
Got the calm cats blowin' their lid
(Disc jock)
You get plush off the rack

And buy plenty or more we got em by the stack
(Disc jock)
Got us walkin' all over the world
For all the fly fellas and all the fly girls

Come on Squat, come on Squat

Now we'd like to introduce to you, Ad Rock

Ad Rock in the house you don't stop
It's the be E A S T I E be O why S with the most finesse
Don't mean to be crude, don't mean to be crass
But listen Guiliani you can kiss my ass
(What?)
You heard my word, now Dove you play the preacher
Get on the mic if you love all the creatures

Well yeah, I got these fishes swimmin' 'round my baracuda
Back in '82 I used to ride a street scooter
Called 'em cuter than pigtails, sales you keep 'em level
And smack you with a shovel and break your lifestyle
(Oww)

Firm on the mic since my days of a child
Got a 'License Too Ill' to flash to police
The only beast I huddles with the Beastie Boys
Bringin' 'Noise' like P.E. to your TV

Aiyyo, this beat's barefoot and knock-kneed
Stripped to the rhyme
And every line made from scratch
Attached like stripes to shell-toes
Thin spools that hold the herb
Mike what's the word?
(Word)

It's like the ooh-la-la, ooh-ooh-la-la
Rhymin' over old breaks like the Mardis Gras
Party people cross and bump they go, ooh, and they, ahh
And Mike D and Ad Rock down with the De La

(Disc jock)
Get the people dancin for real
(Disc jock')
Theater holdin' mass appeal
(Jock)

You can't get enough still
So here's another dose for you to feel
Put ya body in it

Come on Squat, come on Squat
Come on Squat, come on Squat
Come on Squat, come on Squat
Come on Squat, come on Squat

I'm feelin' good, damn good but also confused
This stuff from hip-hop that's bein' misused
It's desirin', acquirin', tryin' to be like Iverson
If it means backstabbin' and also conspirin'

Now, the people in the front, you do the bump, bump
The people in the back, they're not the whack, whack
The people in the middle, come on and wiggle, wiggle
And the people on the side, we can all take a ride

In my VW I done swung an ep' or two
The rear in my hatchback y'all know I scratched that
Here to haystack, keep it rosy in the Rolls
Skiddin' out to place my vote at the polls for Ad Rock

Well, I'm the the toe tapper, yes the hand clapper
From the middle school like the educated rapper
I'm known as an occupational MC
You think I lose sleep if you sleep on me?

It's the rock solid, pilot, here to fly
(Rock)
Reachin' elevations too far for the eye
(Eye)
Miraculous beats over breaks in these packages
Seen and all the types
(All over the globe)

Who thinks our joints is aight, here's a swab for ya ear
(To clean out ya lobe)
And listen to a few views
From two crews spittin' for the art of it
We ain't takin' over but damn sure takin' part of it

Started it ever since we minced meat
You Sloppy Joe's went and took a bit of the corn dog
Stay there, I'ma play there
('cause they pay there)
In the big old Santa Claus bag got discs and now we out

Signin' off, signin' off, our work is done
So come on party people

Young mommies want a hog that ain't cuffing the puttee

They want a jigga with figures sittin' swole with them goodies
So follow me now to the land of the brick lick hitters
Go getters and wig splitters and a little game that gives shivers
Playboy how you figure you can step to a hog

Let off a hundred rounds drums punishing you and yo dogs
My platoon issue wounds that don't heal up
Nigga when the Mack-9 reel up you better throw your shield up
We dope runners and cake runners 

All out big head hunters three glots and sixin it off the chain young stunners
Better slow down lil daddy before you fuck around and get pegged
Run you off like a scared dog with your tail between your legs 
want to be a baller when this G-shit go down

Rolex my wrist watch
And when the gloat cock it's strictly head shots

If a nigga got beef I knock out teeth
Steal you like a thief make the asswhippin' brief
Bring your family grief if the situation is getting sticky
My trigger fingers itchy cause my business is risky

See my hands is fast, my cook game raw
I don't need no pyrex, gimme a coffe mug jar
And I whip it to the left, whip it to the right
Move it all around till they cook it air tight

Run up on us bitch you won't run up no more
Cause we will slide yo bitch ass across the flo, flo, flo

I know y'all rappers can't stand
The fact that I'm back fresh outta jail
Also focused on nothin' but makin' my mail
Ain't got no time to waste, cause the rap game is damn near dead
Kyleon and the King of the Ghetto, came to raise rap from it's death bed
Every song they play on the radio is bullshit homie
Them niggas got they blow up, but we got that good shit homie
Matter fact you might even overdose
Cause I've been known to cause blood clots
I should been known to be a killa, but a bitch killa I never was not
I've always kept it real, even when everybody around me was fake
They don't make like me no more, my kind don't break under pressure
It's death before dishonor nigga
So that means before a rat, like mickey mouse
I'll be another job for the grave digger
I ain't going back behind the fences with the razors
If I'm locked up in the penitentiary, I can't make no paper
So the last time I went, was the last time I'm ever gone be in
Instead of a 5 by 6 cell then a big brick home, that's what I live in

Haters wanna see me fallin' off of my game
They hatin' cause when they see me I'm havin' thangs
Dig these blues, if you jack me, I'm jacking you back
24/7 on my clothes, I keep my hand on my strap

See I'm somethin' like a playa, somethin' like a pimp
Gangsta strut on when when I limp like this
Is re-turn of rapper slash the hood fella
Lookin' for a rap to get my groove back like Stella
Still got a sack of that A-1 good yella
With a baby glock, ready to rock up out fellas

You've been getting quite a name all around the place.
Healing cripples, raising from the dead.
And now I understand you're God,
At least, that's what you've said.
So, you are the Christ, you're the great Jesus Christ.
Prove to me that you're divine; change my water into wine.
That's all you need do, then I'll know it's all true.
Come on, King of the Jews.
Jesus, you just won't believe the hit you've made around here.
You are all we talk about, the wonder of the year.
Oh what a pity if it's all a lie.
Still, I'm sure that you can rock the cynics if you tried.
So, you are the Christ, you're the great Jesus Christ.
Prove to me that you're no fool; walk across my swimming pool.
If you do that for me, then I'll let you go free.
Come on, King of the Jews.
I only ask what I'd ask any superstar.
What is it that you have got that puts you where you are.
I am waiting, yes I'm a captive fan.
I'm dying to be shown that you are not just any man.
So, if you are the Christ, yes the great Jesus Christ
Feed my household with this bread.
You can do it on your head.
Or has something gone wrong. Jesus, why do you take so long?
Oh come on, King of the Jews.
Hey! Aren't you scared of me Christ?
Mr. Wonderful Christ?
You're a joke. You're not the Lord.
You are nothing but a fraud.
Take him away.

Mike D.,"God Damn
When will a nigga get a brake
I work so damn hard but I never come up I do worse with ever breath I take
Sunshine is a luxury
Just to see another day is enough for me
Cause I'm livin' on borrowed time
Every school I go to it might be mine it might be mine
God Damn, I'm trying to hold on to my faith
They use to tell me it was going to get greater later later
Now it's later and I'm still I'm the same place
Anytime I get off the ground
Some crooked ass niggas pull me back down
Bald fade on my fade
Feeling helpless and it's written all over my face

Here we go again just to live another season
I keep my faith in god to peace these demons
Sometimes I win the battle it doesn't mean I win the war
I got to laugh to keep from crying good times I really wonder what they are

Even if I fell there's no reason to feel ashamed
Cause I use to lose I had an opportunity to play in the game
I can't be stopped 98 percent from the field
But they won't pass the rock
Even tho I'm wide open for the shot
Got me ready to scream fuck my team
Seem like the players I'm running with don't want me to touch my dream
With my own hands I'm tired of making money in the name of brothers
I'm trying to touch it with my own hands
Make me wanna rob a bank sometimes
But then I have to spend my life my life my life my life
Dunken one time
And end up back in the pen
So I'm stuck as starter paid as if I was ridin' a Benz
I know it look like I rich but it's not
I just how to take what I got and wipe it so it looks like a lot
Sometimes I wanna give up but when I look at my daughter
I got to survive

Here we go again just to live another season
I keep my faith in god to peace these demons
Sometimes I win the battle it doesn't mean I win the war
I got to laugh to keep from crying good times I really wonder what they are

To many niggas trying to take me off of my game
I'm trying to do something good but because I'm from the hood I always end up in these chains
When you see me in the town you ain't got to slow down I'm in love with my own company
Foney homies see me on the TV and I can see them coming to get me in my sleep
That's why I'm staying sucker free
Cause dealing with hard times is enough for me
I don't need no help my nigga I can do bad on my own
I'm so tried tried tried tried
I'm so tried tried tried tried
But I'm a keep on pushing

Here we go again just to live another season
I keep my faith in god to peace these demons
Sometimes I win the battle it doesn't mean I win the war

Mike Davis,"You see these work boots in my hands, they'll probably fit ye now my son,
Take them, they're a gift from me, why don't you try them on?
It would do your old man good to see you walking in these boots one day,
And take your place among the men who work upon the slipway.

These dead man's boots, though they're old and curled,
When a feller needs a job and a place in the world,
And it's time for a man to put down roots,
And walk to the river in his old man's boots.

He said, ""I'm nearly done and asking this, that ye do one final thing for me!
You're barely but a sapling, and you think that you're a tree.
If ye need a seed to prosper, ye must first put down some roots.
Just one foot then the other in these dead man's boots.""

These dead man's boots know their way down the hill,
They could walk there themselves, and they probably will.
There's a place for ye there to sink your roots,
And take a walk down the river in these dead man's boots.

I said, ""Why in the Hell would I do that? And why would I agree?""
When his hand was all that I'd received, as far as I remember.
It's not as if he'd spoiled me with his kindness up to then ye see.
I'd a plan of me own and I'd quit this place when I came of age September.

These dead man's boots know their way down the hill,
They can walk there themselves, and they probably will.
I'd plenty of choices, and plenty other routes,
And he'd never see me walking in these dead man's boots.

What was it made him think I'd be happy ending up like him?
When he'd hardly got two halfpennies left, or a broken pot to piss in.
He wanted this same thing for me, was that his final wish?
He said, ""What the hell are ye gonna do?""
I said, ""Anything but this!""

These dead man's boots know their way down the hill,
They can walk there themselves and they most likely will.
But they won't walk with me 'cos I'm off the other way,
I've had it up to here, I'm gonna have my say.
When all ye've got left is that cross on the wall?
I want nothing from you, I want nothing at all.
Not a pension, nor a pittance, when your whole life is through,
Get this through your head, I'm nothing like you,
I'm done with all the arguments, there'll be no more dispute,
And ye'll die before ye see me in your dead man's boots.",Dead Man's Boots,2013
Mike Davis,"It's all there in the gospels
The Magdalene girl comes to pay her respects 
But her mind is awhirl when she finds the tomb empty 
The stone had been rolled
Not a sign of a corpse in the dark and the cold
When she reaches the door, sees an unholy sight
There's this solitary figure in a halo of light
He just carries on floating past Calvary Hill
In an almighty hurry, aye but she might catch him still

""Tell me where are ye going Lord, and why in such haste?""
""Now don't hinder me woman, I've no time to waste!
For they're launching a boat on the morrow at noon
And I have to be there before daybreak
Oh, I cannot be missing, the lads'll expect me
Why else would the good Lord himself resurrect me?
For nothing will stop me, I have to prevail
Through the teeth of this tempest, in the mouth of a gale
May the angels protect me if all else should fail

And whatever it was that ye've done to be here
It's the sum of yer hopes yer despairs and yer fears

You see, ""The Queen's took a taxi herself to the station!""
Where the porters, surprised by her lack of Royal baggage,
Bustle her and three corgis to the rear of the carriage,
For the train it is crammed with all Europe's nobility,
And there's none of them famous for their compatibility.
There's a fight over seats, ""I beg pardon Your Grace,
But you'll find that one's mine, so get back in yer place!""

""Aye, but where are they going?"" All the porters debate,
""Why they're going to Newcastle and they daresn't be late,
For they're launching a boat on the Tyne at high tide,
And they've come from all over, from far and from wide.""
There's the old Dalai Lama, aye and the Pontiff of Rome,
Every palace in Europe, and there's nay bugger home.
There's the Duchess of Cornwall and the loyal Prince of Wales,
Looking crushed and uncomfortable in his top hat and tails.
""Why, they haven't got tickets,"" ""Come now, it's just a detail,
There was no time to purchase and one simply has to prevail,
For we'll get to the shipyards or we'll end up in jail!""

I've had a goodly share;
And as I sit here in the comfort,
Of a cozy chair;
My fancy takes me to a humble,
East-side tenement;
Three flights up in the rear,
To where my childhood days were spent.

But mid the dirt and all;
There sat the sweetest angel,
One that I fondly call;

When you're locked in the magic of a kiss

Her lips are much too close to mine
Beware my foolish heart
But should our eager lips combine
Then let the fire start

For this time it isn't fascination
Or a dream that will fade and fall apart
It's love, this time it's love

And lay my heart at the foot of your dress?""

Always have a happy ending?""

Mike Douglas,"He made the night a little brighter, wherever he would go;
The old lamplighter of long, long ago.
His snowy hair was so much whiter beneath the lantern glow,
The old lamplighter of long, long ago.

If there were sweethearts in the park, he'd pass a light and leave it
Dark, His smile would hide a broken heart, you see. For he recalls when
Days were new, he loved someone who loved him too, Who walks along with
Him in memory.
He made the night a little brighter, wherever he would go,

It's you, it's you must go and I must bide.

But come ye back when summer's in the meadow,
Or when the valley's hushed and white with snow,
It's I'll be here in sunshine or in shadow,
Oh, Danny boy, oh Danny boy, I love you so!

But when ye come, and all the flowers are dying,
If I am dead, as dead I well may be,
You'll come and find the place where I am lying,
And kneel and say an Ave there for me.

And all my grave will warmer, sweeter be,
For you will bend and tell me that you love me,
And I shall sleep in peace until you come to me!",Danny Boy,1995

I saw you last night and got that old feeling
When you came in sight I got that old feeling
The moment that you danced by I felt a thrill
And when you caught my eye my heart stood still
Once again I seemed to feel that old yearning
And I knew the spark of love was still burning

For that old feeling, is still in my heart

Who think they're mighty wise,
Just because they know a thing or two.
You see them every day
Walkin' up and down Broadway,
Telling of the wonders they can do.
There's con men and there's boosters,
Card sharks and crap-shooters.
They congregate around the Metropole.
They wear fancy ties and laces,
But where do they get their aces?
They all have got an ace down in the hole!

Some of them write to the old folks for coin,
And that is their ace in the hole,
And others have friends on the old Tenderloin;
That's their old ace in the hole.

They'll tell you of trips that they're going to take
From Florida to the North Pole.

Can you envision

Come with me 
Won't you run through the middle of my mind and see
How fucked up it can be! {x2}

You don't poke or provoke me when I'm smoking
Razor blade out of my coat and slight your throught clean
Drive you out on a boat and now you're fish feed
All because of my weird addiction to make a bitch bleed
(gotta die)
Since a kid I been in all kinds of counsulin
(ya gotta die)
They tell my momma that an evil is inside of em
I'm dangerous and can bust at any second
My wig split and if I explode clear the wreckage
Car crash and I did that shit on purpose
Had a hooker with me and she's in need of medical service
Coulda took her with me, but instead I left her for dead
And now the lookin for me so I been hidin out in the shed
I been in it for a week now
And I been fendin just ta get somebody bleedin' but in the meanwhile
I lay low unless the bleedin won't stop
I got bored and cut of my hand with one chop

But you're not gonna tell me what to play
Cause I got a flava that's so addictive I know you'll dig it
O Kaaaayyyyy
Come on now we can play a game
Grab yourself a shovel, dig a grave
Promise not to die 
It's so addictive I know you'll dig it

Sometimes brain waves get scrambled
I go blank and fly off the handle
More hot air for the birthday candle
Celebrating another year off in the gamble
(hell yeah)
So thankful, so appoligetic
So not what I expected
That it's border line pathetic
(fuck ya'll)
But who am I to judge
I don't hold a grudge
Hold the gat to my dome and pray the trigger don't budge
(blaaaa)
Love in the chamber and I aim to kill
The man in the mirror for a change of feel
Switch the pace up, paint his face up with bloodstains
Then redeacorate the bathroom with most of his brains

[chorus x2]

So addictive I know you'll dig it o [x4] kay

Mike Eldred,"﻿첫 번째 앨범은 시큰둥
두 번째는 대중들의 작은 집중 뿐
세 네 번째 부터
이 썩은 scene의 귀중품
새빨간 19금 딱지가 붙었지만
still 진실만을 썼다
음악은 나의 길
심의실에서 평가 불능한 appeal
득과 실 벌써 decade
Still mic를 check 해
Like JK형 밝은 미래 in my arms
실낱 꿈 풍파와 입맞춤
가사를 쓸 때마다
혼자가 아니야 in my room
내게 숨 같던
친구들의 반이 하늘나라
내가 대신 꾸는 꿈 속에서
편히 잠을 자라
맺힌 내 땀을 봐라
I\'m a damn 괴물
Made an independent label
cause I won\'t ever settle

처음엔 지루한
학창 시절을 열 창이었다
모든 게 좋아 고통은 먼 산이었다
부모는 답이 없다
친구는 관심 없다며
모두가 벽을 만들고서
난 남이었다
몇 해간 수돗물이 밥이라도
사방에 짙은 안개뿐인 반 지하도
견디고 버티다 보니 뭐 괜찮았어
그래도 택시 타는 녀석은
좀 배 아팠어
하나 둘 배고픔에 떠나갈 때
나 역시 고민했었지만
결과는 반대
하나 둘 팬들이 더 쌓여갈 때
음악과 맘은 같았지만
뭘 하든 깠네
그래도 뭐 어쩌겠어
잡초 같은 걸
아직도 빛나는 그 애들처럼
산소 같은 걸
그냥 좀비처럼 걸어 세상을 얻다
모든 걸 고통 없이
원한다면 해답은 없다
내가 해냈으면 너도
충분히 할 수 있으니 believe
내가 해냈으면 너도

누구나 깎아내는

대안 없는 음악 믿음이 안 서
착실한 기반 닦은 확실한 상품
어설픈 화가들의 막 칠한 작품
둘 중 하나를 분명히 해
이력서를 써
결과야 뭐 어떻던 미련은 못써

She was wonderful,
Everything perfect,
We both had the world
But I filled up my senses
With thoughts from the ghost
And I spent her life savings
Left no room for

Crying and trying
And screaming aloud,
I barely can see her tumultuous crowds
Are careful to hide her and sing much too loud

We're gonna have a problem here

Y'all act like you never seen a white person before
Jaws all on the floor like Pam like Tommy just burst in the door
And started whoopin' her ass worse than before
They first were divorced, throwin' her over furniture (Agh!)
It's the return of the ""Ah, wait, no way, you're kidding
He didn't just say what I think he did, did he?""
And Dr. Dre said, nothing, you idiots!
Dr. Dre's dead, he's locked in my basement (ha ha!)
Feminist women love Eminem
""Chicka, chicka, chicka, Slim Shady, I'm sick of him
Look at him, walkin' around, grabbin' his you-know-what
Flippin' the you-know-who,"" ""Yeah, but he's so cute though.""
Yeah, I probably got a couple of screws up in my head loose
But no worse than what's goin' on in your parents' bedrooms
Sometimes I wanna get on TV and just let loose
But can't, but it's cool for Tom Green to hump a dead moose
""My bum is on your lips, my bum is on your lips""
And if I'm lucky, you might just give it a little kiss
And that's the message that we deliver to little kids
And expect them not to know what a woman's clitoris is
Of course they're gonna know what intercourse is
By the time they hit fourth grade
They've got the Discovery Channel, don't they?
We ain't nothin' but mammals—well, some of us, cannibals
Who cut other people open like cantaloupes
But if we can hump dead animals and antelopes
Then there's no reason that a man and another man can't elope
But if you feel like I feel, I got the antidote
Women, wave your pantyhose, sing the chorus, and it goes

Well, I do, so fuck him and fuck you too!

Half of you critics can't even stomach me, let alone stand me

Why, so you guys could just lie to get me here?
So you can sit me here next to Britney Spears?
Shit, Christina Aguilera better switch me chairs
So I can sit next to Carson Daly and Fred Durst
And hear 'em argue over who she gave head to first
Little bitch put me on blast on MTV
""Yeah, he's cute, but I think he's married to Kim, hee-hee.""
I should download her audio on MP3
And show the whole world how you gave Eminem VD
I'm sick of you little girl and boy groups
All you do is annoy me, so I have been sent here to destroy you
And there's a million of us just like me
Who cuss like me, who just don't give a fuck like me
Who dress like me, walk, talk and act like me
And just might be the next best thing, but not quite me

So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up
Please stand up, please stand up?

I'm like a head trip to listen to, ‘cause I'm only givin' you
Things you joke about with your friends inside your livin' room
The only difference is I got the balls to say it in front of y'all
And I don't gotta be false or sugarcoat it at all
I just get on the mic and spit it
And whether you like to admit it, I just shit it
Better than 90% of you rappers out can
Then you wonder: ""How can
Kids eat up these albums like Valiums?""
It's funny, ‘cause at the rate I'm going, when I'm 30
I'll be the only person in the nursing home flirting
Pinching nurse's asses when I'm jacking off with Jergens
And I'm jerking, but this whole bag of Viagra isn't working
And every single person is a Slim Shady lurking
He could be working at Burger King, spittin' on your onion rings
Or in the parking lot, circling, screaming, ""I don't give a fuck!""
With his windows down and his system up
So will the real Shady please stand up
And put one of those fingers on each hand up?
And be proud to be outta your mind and outta control
And one more time, loud as you can, how does it go?

I'm Slim Shady, yes I'm the real Shady

[T.I.]
I was born into poverty raised in the sewerage
Streets always would be a part of me, it made me the truest
And even when my days weren't the bluest
I never ran from adversity, instead I ran to it
Fear ain't in the heart of me I learned just do it
You get courage in your fears right after you go through it
Now I come through in a Coupe on 22s
That ain't bad for a nigga who ain't even finish school huh?
Don't get me wrong I never been a fool
I just put off graduating for a pair of tennis shoes
I used to use the beats to paint my pain
But nowadays man I can't complain
I got several automobiles and they all on things
Several solitaires and they all in one chain
Used to see me in the mall I'm the same
And brains from a couple broads on the plane

[Chorus]

[Common]
I come from Chi-Town lost and found in the struggle
Where dudes say stay safe and stay out of trouble
Speak is muffed the law and B goin' try to cuff you
Those with duffles move weight and have muscles
I came through the dirt with a verse for the people
Open up for Daddy Kane and Easy up at the Regal
The radio rarely put their needle on my record
They ain't see how the hood and heaven were connected
Sounds projected, ain't show how effective
Lessons learned, sessions turned to life reflected
And everything I found real in life know I kept it
They say life's a teacher, you're gonna get tested
When a nigga changed they keep saying that nigga strange
Couldn't see how my mind won't be the lame
Ahead of my time I caught up with the game
Making good music making paper making change

[Chorus]

[T.I.]
I put on gasoline drawers I stood in the fire
With enough heat to set the hood on fire
Man you niggas think Suge was off the wire
You should've seen the squad before I had Messiah
We assumed the title as the number one supplier
Felt like I was selling blow since I was in diapers
And wish a nigga would come try us
We was cool with the killers, best friends with the lifers
Quick to up and scrap with niggas who want to deny
For what we considered then as a lucrative empire
But like that pimping time flash by you
Now I wonder what the judge think as he reading my priors
Prison ain't full and the reefer ain't bias
You ain't got to tell and distant the liars
Gave the jail hell and shot birds at the hearse
Lived through worse and reversed the curse

The way they was movin' analyzin' the shit they was doin' in the club
Grillin' and screwin' their faces up
Felt like they chilled and moved a couple places up laying me close
But I'm sayin we mostly be in a spot celebratin' somethin' and probably makin' a toast
Party to we Probably shakin the coast and hardly ever start a problem unless you gotta
I'm sayin' we suppose to be enjoyin' ourself nigga
'Cause entrepreneur and gwap connesuirs Employin ourself niggas
Explotin' my wealth with the company and people
Until a hater got to anointin himself too be the one to come in
And had a couple dudes to support him actin all like sure like he had the thing on him
And then after we finish beatin' on him now he know we ain't playin'
That's when he walked away sayin'

Shit is really bug to me
How some of these niggas they be comin' and settin' theyself up to you hit them
And gettin' theyself up in the altercations they don't really be needin'
Until it's to late and they realize that a body part is bleedin'
Instead of bein out and enjoyin the people they be actin all tough yappin' and bluffin'
Instead of bein all peaceful the partially thugs be spreadin' like cancer
Frontin' like gangsters until you bust their head and they lookin' like dancers
While they leanin and the rockin with after
You could've avoided beef! This shit is annoying chief!
'Cause now you got the bouncer stoppin the door
Can't let nobody else is gettin' in 'cause we moppin the floor with ya
Instead you could have came to party and be?
Bag you a chick while you sipin' on somethin' but
Instead you chose to do somethin' that made us
Fuck yo shit up for playin' now what the fuck is he sayin'.

Then I'm hearing dishes drop, 'cause I walked away from my dinner with schmucks

Then I aimed to the front of the K-Mart shopping center
With' a coupon book and a hundred and ten bucks
And a bunch of change and wife beater with a mustard stain
I'll crush your brain like I'm crushing pills
What the fuck's the muthfuckin' deal?

the roofie to Roethlisberger
You are gonna wind up six feet deep
Under that shits creek so I hope that you brought preservers

You could put a turd on the plate
Silverware on the tablecloth to serve us
You don't bring shit to the table
I mean your grill like a Seville when a mark gets murdered
You pushing the envelope, and I'm shovin' that whole post office further
Right off the surface, to the serpents in the darkest and the farthest corner

How many bars, how many bars
Maui, wow wee, sour diesel, how many jars,
To all my people I'll be the Mars, mommy come on
She can actually wrap my nut sack 'round the back of her neck in a bathroom stall
And she can just puke from sipping this piss from my twenty four inch catheter cord

I'm the type that'll take a bath with' a whore
Drown her, bang her head on the passenger door
When I'm stashin' 'er in the back, smackin' her forehead on the dash
And its accidentally blowin', a Benz jeep horn

Mike Esposito,"An old cowpoke went riding out one dark and windy day,
Upon a ridge he rested as he went along his way,
When all at once a mighty herd of red-eyed cows he saw,
A ploughin' through the ragged skies
And up a cloudy draw.
Yippee-yi-ay, yippee-yi-o,
The ghost herd in the sky.

Their brands were still on fire and their hooves was made of steel,
Their horns wuz black and shiny and their hot breath he could feel,
A bolt of fear went through him as they thundered through the sky,
For he saw the riders comin' hard
And he heard their mournful cry.
Yippee-yi-ay, yippee-yi-o,
Ghost riders in the sky.

Their faces gaunt their eyes were blurred and shirts all soaked
With sweat,
They're ridin' hard to catch that herd but they ain't caught them yet
'Cause they've got to ride forever on that range up in the sky,
On horses snortin' fire
As they ride on, hear their cry.
Yippee-yi-ay, yippee-yi-o,
Ghost riders in the sky.

As the riders loped on by him he heard one call his name,
""If you want to save your soul from hell a-riding on our range,
Then cowboy change your ways today or with us you will ride
A-try'ng to catch the devil's herd
Across these endless skies.""

I was down to St. James infirmary, I saw my baby there
She was stretched out on a long white table, 
So sweet, cool and so fair

Wherever she may be
She may search this whole wide world over
Never find a sweeter man as me

Three pretty women to sing a song
Stick a jazz band on my hearse wagon

Mike Falzone,"I've been thinking in between breaks from drinking
About the the things you said concerning my singing

Oh, you said the top ten billboards, I could break in
Tell me are you for real or just faking?
I grow up and you think the hippies would dig me
I would work on my flow if you thought I had hip-hop in me

To impress the girls I'd work on my sensitivity
As for my debts, who's proud for punk crowd longevity

CHORUS
And if you told me that I could be famous
I present you with a list of changes I could make
We could fake the world out

It's all 'cause of us I'd caused shotgun on the tour bus
Playing every show shirt lest ladies would adore us
Throwing pennies on stage at every single chorus
Then we'd break up the band 'cause all this money bores us

CHORUS

We could fake the world out (x3)

Mike Farley,"And now at last, she's gone away
Memories linger on this day
A thousand or so miles down the road she's gone to stay
And just like a song I wrote before
We said our goodbyes outside that door
The ties had been broken but now it was all for sure
If miracles happen as they say
Tell me just where and on what day
'cause I never seen nothing that I have not seen before
She's walking right out that door
She's on my mind but not the same
The demons were just too hard to tame
It's hard not to lose when you consider this a game
If miracles happen as they say
Tell me just where and on what day
'cause I never seen nothing that I have not seen before
If miracles happen where you've been
Show me some proof of what you've seen
'cause I never seen nothing that I have not seen before
She's walking right out that door
She's gone, she's gone away

Tossin' and turnin' in someone else's bed

Or so they don't want to is what I get from you
Why did you tell me what we already knew?
The limbs on my conscience are all black and blue
I can't stop thinkin 'bout what we could've been
If I was a bad boy, and you were my sin
Tell me your secrets, that I want to hear
Whisper those words softly into my ear
Walk on the wild side, maybe we'll roam
Tell me your secrets, before i go home
Been round the block, and I been here before

And think a little lower before he can speak

Came running to the city
To talk about the man she saw
She took her pitcher
Went to the well
Water she intended to draw
The stranger she met there
She didn't know where he came from
But when he told her
Every sinful thing she had done
The man at the well
Blessed my soul and go on

Her friends asked her
""Do you know that man?""
She said ""No, I never saw him before""
They asked her ""Did you get his name?""
She said ""He didn't tell me and I don't know
When he spoke, my soul caught on fire
And I'll remember that day 'til the day that I die
He stopped by
Blessed my soul and go on

The stranger was next seen in our city
He was standing off an angry mob
Defending a women who'd been caught
In the very act of adultery
For pity and mercy she sought
He said ""Ye who is without sin cast the first stone""
And when he raised her from the ground
All her accusers were gone
He gave her a smile, waved farewell and moved on

The crowd asked her
""Do you know the man?""
She said ""No, I never saw him before""
They asked her ""Did you get his name?""
""He didn't tell me and I don't know

And I ain't gonna do no wrong

You won't believe me that I love you only
I'd rather be lonely than happy with somebody else

You might find the night time the right time for kissing
But night time is my time for just reminiscing
Regretting instead of forgetting with somebody else
There'll be no else unless that someone is you, you, you

I want your love but I don't want to borrow
I have it today and give back tomorrow

We'll sigh goodbye to all we ever had
Alone where we have walked together
I'll remember April and be glad

I'll be content you loved me once in April
Your lips were warm and love and spring were new
I'm not afraid of autumn and her sorrow
For I'll remember April and you

The fire will dwindle into glowing ashes
For flames live such a little while
I won't forget but I won't be lonely
I'll remember April and smile",I'll Remember April,2006

That to me is what your eyes are,
Soft as stars in April skies are,
Tell me some day you'll fulfill
Their promise of a thrill.

Star eyes,
Flashing eyes in which my hopes rise,
Let me show you where my heart lies.
Let me prove that it adores
That loveliness of yours.

All my life I've felt
Content to stargaze at the skies.
Now I only want to to melt
The stardust in your eyes.

Star eyes,
When if ever, will my lips know
If it's me for whom those eyes glow?
Makes no diff'rence where you are,
Your eyes still hold my wishing star,

I never trust faith with my trust funds
I keep it in a safe place nigga, lump sum
Camera surveillance a bunch of fucking stun guns
I'm a snare to the drum, burum-bum-bum
Her virgin homicide I show her how we drum-a-drum
She doesn't come for me, bitch only say she come for fun
What's up hunny bun, wanna feel your tummy rum?
Rumbling in a ring with pills to fucking numb
Your system is my fucking dick-dom
Feel the friction of my children with down syndrome
I'm rehearsing for my funeral, triple six, Roman numerals
MellowHype musical, talk to my wolves like Dolittle
Think with a migrane like a fucking eye strain
Drink bottles of champagne on a fucking biplane
If it doesn't add up then ask the students my name
I'm fucking Einstein, I'm sane

Knock, knock! Delivery, I'm the rhetorician
Body decomposition, ripping through your rhythm
I suggest you stop and listen to this non-prescription
Fuck your contradiction, this my composition

Leprechaun, hexagon, I transform: Decepticon
Rasputin, I'm half mutant, fuck financial aid, cash students
I'm too pursuant to over-do shit, super fluent
My flow is overheated it needs coolant, shit
Fuck being poor and return to the school and shoot it up
While I shoot it like a porno bitch with cool whip, shit
I dive scuba, barracuda, shark water in Cuba
Chicken head of the sea, but I don't fucking eat tuna
I sneak her in my room like Puma
My bedroom's Jerusalem and I'm Judah
Suck on my Messiah or die and cry in fire
Truth is the curse of liars so is Mrs. Doubtfire
Fat bitches, dope beats is what my niggas acquire
If you're broke, get a cast, bitch I'm dope, do the math
Triple six, sipping through a golden flask
Salute Mellowhype or mustard gas, I ain't gay but I'm a fucking ass

The one man army, my automatic Rose Gold
Double O, subtract one numero from Seven
Taking niggas back to school like a bus ride for adolescence
Wolves plotting for their future like fucking investments
And I go so hard, that's why your bitch keep on caressing
Flat iron and pressing my VCR buttons
But this a DVD so you can watch it with your cousins
2010, bitch we get it in
Go ahead and tell your friends, I hope them bitches be twins
Doobies in Jacuzzi's, white bitches with big booties

I be like hello, play them corners like their cellos
It go crazy in the streets when the hype gets mellow

Sitting on a haystack, we go off like grenade caps)
Makeshift millions, knocking down your buildings

Balling like Camby, organic like cran' be
Glass house on a beach for when I want to get sandy

I take a strike in L.A. Lights like I'm dodging with Manny
Girls drop them panties, even their aunties... no grannies
Grandma, I'm leaking on the beat like a tampon
Fool, I'm spitting 'til my whole Odd Future camps on
We get our camp on, Jansport and Eddie Bauer
Stay fresh before hopping up in any shower
Death to haters tryna take minutes up off my hour
I got the hood with me, I'm the nigga with the power

They're confused, scratch their heads like there's fucking lice in it
Party hard, man it's Golden, have them hands foldin'
Mellow keep it rollin', that's how we stay Loaded

For some reason I couldn't get a hold of Taco and Jasper
But, I just brought all your friends to talk to you
Because, they're really worried about you
I thought it would be better if, they could talk to you

It was all a dream, I used to read Complex magazines
When I rhyme I'm tryna get pictures in High Times
Smoke trees and see my dreams hanging in the sky line
Swanton bomb off the bed into a fine dime
In my mind I'm just tryna smoke the finest
And get high sticking bad hyenas in vagina's
I'm the fliest when it come to this, fire when I come to spit
I am getting higher when the lighter comes in front of this
I'm a stoner yeah, yeah, yeah you get the picture now
30 thousand feet gon' make it hard for me to simmer down
Another flight, another beat, another city, wow
Thus another couple bitches crying when I kick 'em out
Where we at? We on top of the world

And five minutes from suicide, I biked it to the park
I walked onto the block, met a guy, burgundy 'Preme snap-back
Hurling himself and cars, and flirting with blond Cadillacs
All was great, all was great, Frankie had the blues in fact
Bunch of pale hipster girls, pretty, but they booty flat
Teenage males, couldn't tell, I was going through
And had a wallet full of cream, Amex Green, Beamer almost black
Parked in front the studio Bastard's recorded at
Earl, Gilbert, Tyler, Hodgy, Domo, Left, Taco, Nakel
Sydney, Lionel, Juan, Michael, Jasper, Hal and Matt
Bet I'm missing several but I had to bring that pattern back
We live inside a house that says fuck 'em on the welcome mat
Deep inside the ear canals of Bill O'Reilly's daughter that's
Where I'm at? Now where we at? Wolf Gang, where we at?

Swell motions get promotions, to my whole team
Hell yeah I smoke weed 'cause I like to go green
Professor Beats educates niggas, let me proceed
Shine chandelier bright mike, if your nose bleeds
We at Randy's ordering that 306
Milk and glaze is the greed gold mix me
Your bitch is coming along, yeah she hum to my song
Singing like they were for her, but they were for the blur
No longer, but we working, premature, immature
She's unsure, I'm for sure, blouse and dress and my shirt
On the floor then pick it up, out the door, door
Chased, an imaginary friend, a reverie absorption
Impregnate the dream 'til it has an abortion
Where we at? We on top of the world

Everything they say I'd never have, I'm seeing
Now, I bet they see that we balling like All-Star Weekend
Always been the most cool, they chase our shade
They say life switches pace when you got shit made
So I'm just tryna get paid, don't you remember the days
When your dreams were the only thing that kept you sane
And too often they think that they could stop me
Now every show we makin' half a Maserati
And the only thing blocking me is paparazzi
Now it's gold Rolex's if they try to clock me
Everything stays in the box like fighters in hockey
Miss me if you're thinking we slack, work hard
I got the world saying every single Friday is black
Took your bitch, you ain't getting her back, 'cause she know
Where we at nigga?
We on top of the world

Where we at, niggas?
Where the fuck we at, man?
You niggas don't know me, huh
Where we at?

Down to fucking Earth, huh, down to fucking Earth, huh
Fuck everybody, here goes some extra girth Sir
You fucking critics are making my nerves hurt
Since I'm saying fuck everybody I guess that I'm a fucking pervert
My window is a book and I'm a fucking crook
Stealing phones to call home but the line is off the hook
My mom ain't paid the bill, guess I can't pay it either
I ain't signed a fucking deal yet
But when I do Clancy and Dave are to take a percentages
That could pay the whole city's fucking mortgage
Hopefully I make a lot porn from touring in fucking Oregon
From playing piano organs and hopefully I can pay the bill
Shit is getting real, people begin to feel
Like I'm changing, but their complaining making big fucking deals
About some shit, they bitch and pout
(Can we get backstage man?) No, fagot, it's sold out
(Come on why you holding out, I though we was boys, without me
You wouldn't be Tyler the Creator, you're from the Dirty
I can tell whenever you perform, a leopard can't change it's spots)
But I'm a fucking unicorn (Whatever man)
Look, you can't stop me, I'm going full monty
Fuck that, I'm Hitler, everyone's a fucking Nazi
Wolf Gi-di-dang you be roaming where the fox be
And I be where, anybody cares
I try to preach ""Fuck age, live dreams and have fun""
(Here's some give a fuck, cake) Oh, maybe I should have some
(Asshole, have none) How can I wake up on the wrong side
Of the bed, when I don't even fucking have one?
When I'm on that stage I feel important
A whole fucking assortment of children that's taking Ritalin
Because the teacher said that the therapist wasn't feeling him
You gotta be fucking kidding me
At school I was a zero, now I'm every boy's hero

And fans think that I'm more awkward then Kristen Stewart
Couldn't do it without the losers that thought I wouldn't do it
No sympathy for the ones that never stuck to it

Deep inside the ear canals of Bill O'Reilly's daughter that's
Where I'm at? Now where we at? Wolf Gang, where we at?

Swell motions get promotions, to my whole team
Hell yeah I smoke weed 'cause I like to go green
Professor Beats educates niggas, let me proceed
Shine chandelier bright mike, if your nose bleeds
We at Randy's ordering that 306
Milk and glaze is the greed gold mix me
Your bitch is coming along, yeah she hum to my song
Singing like they were for her, but they were for the blur
No longer, but we working, premature, immature
She's unsure, I'm for sure, blouse and dress and my shirt
On the floor then pick it up, out the door, door
Chased, an imaginary friend, a reverie absorption
Impregnate the dream 'til it has an abortion
Where we at? We on top of the world

Everything they say I'd never have, I'm seeing
Now, I bet they see that we balling like All-Star Weekend
Always been the most cool, they chase our shade
They say life switches pace when you got shit made
So I'm just tryna get paid, don't you remember the days
When your dreams were the only thing that kept you sane
And too often they think that they could stop me
Now every show we makin' half a Maserati
And the only thing blocking me is paparazzi
Now it's gold Rolex's if they try to clock me
Everything stays in the box like fighters in hockey
Miss me if you're thinking we slack, work hard
I got the world saying every single Friday is black
Took your bitch, you ain't getting her back, 'cause she know
Where we at nigga?
We on top of the world

Where we at, niggas?
Where the fuck we at, man?
You niggas don't know me, huh
Where we at?

Down to fucking Earth, huh, down to fucking Earth, huh
Fuck everybody, here goes some extra girth Sir
You fucking critics are making my nerves hurt
Since I'm saying fuck everybody I guess that I'm a fucking pervert
My window is a book and I'm a fucking crook
Stealing phones to call home but the line is off the hook
My mom ain't paid the bill, guess I can't pay it either
I ain't signed a fucking deal yet
But when I do Clancy and Dave are to take a percentages
That could pay the whole city's fucking mortgage
Hopefully I make a lot porn from touring in fucking Oregon
From playing piano organs and hopefully I can pay the bill
Shit is getting real, people begin to feel
Like I'm changing, but their complaining making big fucking deals
About some shit, they bitch and pout
(Can we get backstage man?) No, fagot, it's sold out
(Come on why you holding out, I though we was boys, without me
You wouldn't be Tyler the Creator, you're from the Dirty
I can tell whenever you perform, a leopard can't change it's spots)
But I'm a fucking unicorn (Whatever man)
Look, you can't stop me, I'm going full monty
Fuck that, I'm Hitler, everyone's a fucking Nazi
Wolf Gi-di-dang you be roaming where the fox be
And I be where, anybody cares
I try to preach ""Fuck age, live dreams and have fun""
(Here's some give a fuck, cake) Oh, maybe I should have some
(Asshole, have none) How can I wake up on the wrong side
Of the bed, when I don't even fucking have one?
When I'm on that stage I feel important
A whole fucking assortment of children that's taking Ritalin
Because the teacher said that the therapist wasn't feeling him
You gotta be fucking kidding me
At school I was a zero, now I'm every boy's hero
And they fear it when they hear it when that little fucker's reciting my lyrics
Yeah rebel nigga cheer it, dead parents everywhere, it's smelling like teen spirit
Okay, fuck it, Elvis has left the building",Window,2011

Or should I say she once had me 
She showed me her room 
Isn't it good Norwegian wood? 

She asked me to stay 
And she told me to sit anywhere

And I noticed there wasn't a chair 

I sat on a rug biding my time 
Drinking her wine 
We talked until two and then she said 
""It's time for bed"" 

She told me she worked 
In the morning and started to laugh 
I told her I didn't 
And crawled off to sleep in the bath

Fling me from pole to pole
A car pulls up and drags me downtown
To try to make up diamonds from some coal
Disco Balls and Revolving Doors
And then I see you though my eyes are growing round
I start to tell you I'm on the fast track and I don't need you here to slow me down

(Chorus)
Then I hear the voices in my head
Telling me to stay right here and stand
The choir of guardian angels asking me to take a deeper breath
Telling me to slow down and live before I'm gone and dead

I see you from marry-go-round now
Lifts me like a flying saucer ride
Down on the ground you're like a tiny ant
I see you holding blood from where I glide

(Chorus)
And then I hear the voices in my head
Telling me to go back down instead
The choir of guardian angels asking me to take a deeper breath
Telling me to slow down and live before I'm gone and dead

screaming tongues but they're twisting all the words reinterpreting my every little word
I'm trying to get by with all this comotion making me uneasy in my skin
I swing back now to pick you up where I left you back in that field
And we pull from home all aligned and now I know the voices are for real
And then I hear the voices in my head
Thanking me for doing what they said
The choir of guardian angels asking me to take a deeper breath
Telling me to slow down and live before I'm gone and dead

With a shotgun in his arms

Before you leave my farm

Which replaced Joseph's hand

Do for me as he would do for you
With blood and water bricks and mortar

And he emptied out the shells

But I sure can't waste my time
So move aside and let me go my way

I can hold my tongue, I can hold my wine
I can hold my own, I'm the restless kind

Well I've seen the country and I've been to town
Rode in limousines with the tops rolled down
Walked down the road where the rivers freeze
Whatever it takes I do what I please
I can hold my horses, I can hold the line
I can hold my own, I'm the restless kind

And I never assume what I'm gonna find

I won't save this for tonight

Mike Hockenhull,"Twas the night before Christmas, when all through the house
Not a creature was stirring, not even a mouse.
The stockings were hung by the chimney with care,
In hopes that St. Nicholas soon would be there.

The children were nestled all snug in their beds,
While visions of sugar-plums danced in their heads.
And mama in her 'kerchief, and I in my cap,
Had just settled our brains for a long winter's nap.

When out on the lawn there arose such a clatter,
I sprang from the bed to see what was the matter.
Away to the window I flew like a flash,
Tore open the shutters and threw up the sash.

The moon on the breast of the new-fallen snow
Gave the luster of mid-day to objects below.
When, what to my wondering eyes should appear,
But a miniature sleigh, and eight tinny reindeer.

With a little old driver, so lively and quick,
I knew in a moment it must be St Nick.
More rapid than eagles his coursers they came,
And he whistled, and shouted, and called them by name!

""Now Dasher! now, Dancer! now, Prancer and Vixen!
On, Comet! On, Cupid! on, on Donner and Blitzen!
To the top of the porch! to the top of the wall!
Now dash away! Dash away! Dash away all!""

As dry leaves that before the wild hurricane fly,
When they meet with an obstacle, mount to the sky.
So up to the house-top the coursers they flew,
With the sleigh full of Toys, and St Nicholas too.

And then, in a twinkling, I heard on the roof
The prancing and pawing of each little hoof.
As I drew in my head, and was turning around,
Down the chimney St Nicholas came with a bound.

He was dressed all in fur, from his head to his foot,
And his clothes were all tarnished with ashes and soot.
A bundle of Toys he had flung on his back,
And he looked like a peddler, just opening his pack.

His eyes-how they twinkled! his dimples how merry!
His cheeks were like roses, his nose like a cherry!
His droll little mouth was drawn up like a bow,
And the beard of his chin was as white as the snow.

The stump of a pipe he held tight in his teeth,
And the smoke it encircled his head like a wreath.
He had a broad face and a little round belly,
That shook when he laughed, like a bowlful of jelly!

He was chubby and plump, a right jolly old elf,
And I laughed when I saw him, in spite of myself!
A wink of his eye and a twist of his head,
Soon gave me to know I had nothing to dread.

He spoke not a word, but went straight to his work,
And filled all the stockings, then turned with a jerk.
And laying his finger aside of his nose,
And giving a nod, up the chimney he rose!

He sprang to his sleigh, to his team gave a whistle,
And away they all flew like the down of a thistle.
But I heard him exclaim, 'ere he drove out of sight,
""Happy Christmas to all, and to all a good-night!""",The Night Before Christmas,2006
Mike Holober,"And now the purple dusk of twilight time
Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb
Always reminding me that we're apart
You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms
The nightingale 
Tells his fairytale
Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain
My stardust melody
The memory of love's refrain.",Stardust,2003

Mike Jimenez,"Do you remember the 21st night of September?
Love was changing the minds of pretenders
While chasing the clouds away

Our hearts were ringing
In the key that our souls were singing.
As we danced in the night,
Remember how the stars stole the night away

Ba de ya, say do you remember
Ba de ya, dancing in September
Ba de ya, never was a cloudy day

My thoughts are with you
Holding hands with your heart to see you
Only blue talk and love,
Remember how we knew love was here to stay

Now December found the love that we shared in September.
Only blue talk and love,
Remember the true love we share today

Ba de ya, say do you remember
Ba de ya, dancing in September
Ba de ya, never was a cloudy day

Ba de ya, say do you remember
Ba de ya, dancing in September
Ba de ya, golden dreams were shiny days

Leave 'em there on the floor
And hang that old hat
On the hook by the door

Leave the horses and cattle
And the ranch far behind
They've had you all week
Tonight cowboy you're mine

Turn down those lights
On that nightstand
Let all that weight on your shoulders
Just melt in my hands

That ole latch on the barn door
And that broken fence line
Will still be there tomorrow

Young Pimp, know what we doin'? (Texas!)

[Chorus: Pimp C]
Smokin' out, pourin' up, puttin' dick up in yo' slut
All my cars got leather and wood, in my hood we call it buck
Smokin' out, pourin' up, puttin' dick up in yo' slut
All my cars got leather and wood, in my hood we call it buck
Smokin' out, pourin' up, puttin' dick up in yo' slut

I'm smokin' out, pourin' up, keepin lean up in my cup
All my cars got leather and wood, in my (uh!) hood we call it

[Pimp C]
Grippin' grain, switchin' lanes, sellin' cocaine outta' candy thang
Jammin' Lil' Wayne, gotta trunk of bang, 'cause I'ma ""Hot Boy"", gotta hot flame
And my hoes pay me, just like Baby, that's the only way they can lay me
Niggas shoot slugs but they ain't graze me, they want Sweet Jones be pushin daisies
But you slow and lazy, you can't fade me, that's the reason I knock ya lady
How you gon' pimp wit'cha dick up in her? I told the pimp God that you was a sinner
You takin' these square hoes out to dinner, the bitch chose me 'cause she want a winner
I mix her whole head up like a blender, hoe need a daddy, you see pretender
I used to be a young drug dealer, now I'ma young girl stealer
I hit the streets like just like Steve Jackson, nigga say my name watch the priest reaction
Sweet Jones or Sweet James? Switched my name and finger fucked the game
The nigga fell off 'cause his raps are shitty, plus a nigga need to move up out the city
The game gritty but the bitch pretty, lemme snatch the white girl up off ya titty
Ya heard me right, I play wit' what I knows
Wear platinum piece and wit' the Gucci clothes
Paid my dues, I ain't came to lose, I wear Marvin Blackman tennis shoes
In the winter time, mink coat to match and they on the floor wit' my candy 'Lac

[Chorus]

[Mike Jones]
Uh! I'm comin' out in that candy thang, 8 carats in my pinky rang
Drop the top in the parking lot so y'all can see where the deserts swang
Candy paint what I'm flippin' on, 84's and vogues what I'm tippin' on
Momo wood grain I'm grippin' on, grippin' on
I said! Candy paint what I'm flippin' on, 84's and vogues what I'm tippin' on
Momo wood grain I'm grippin' on, codeine in cup I'm sippin' on
I hog the lane in that candy train, swangin' left and right then I turn up the bang
I'ma say it for those who don't know my name, know my name
They call me Mike Jones and I blew up quick, Ice Age the name you can't tell by the wrists?
I sit on buck in that candy 6, and I keep that thing real handy bitch!
I keep it trill like Pimp and Bun, do hoes bad and leave 'em on the run
'Cause I don't got no love for 'em but hard dick and bubble gum!
I said! I keep it trill like Pimp and Bun, do hoes bad and leave 'em on the run
'Cause I don't got no love for 'em but hard dick and bubble gum!
I said! I keep it trill like Pimp and Bun, do hoes bad and leave 'em on the run
'Cause I don't got no love for 'em but hard dick and bubble gum!

[Chorus]

[Bun B]
When I pull the slab out and hit the block, wit' them 4's and vogues they clankin' out
When they trunks pop, drop the top, don't be surprised you can go in shock
Wit' them neon lights, candy paint, belts and buckles across the back
Don't disrespect or call this a Cadi', maybe this more than just a 'Lac
Some like it white but I'ma go to green, purple dro up in the swisha
Horny ladies sittin' on the grill, wood grain to grip it's hard to miss us
We ""G"" so don't dismiss us, been here before gon' be here later
Down wit' that you understand the G Code and if you don't then you see hater
Insult, I can't roll wit'cha, it ain't how I do it man
I'm from Texas, P.A. to be exact where we screw it man {*screwed*}
U.G.K. for life is the family, that's how we get down
Bring them trill niggas to ya hood and shut ya shit down
Playa you need to sit down, you outta' ya league
Tryna keep up wit' the trill, you just might die of fatigue
You can't carry the load, you can't handle the weight
Not like them boys up out that Lone Star state so get it straight

A song through its doors 
Just as if it seems to know

You will understand too 
In these words that I say

To everyone but you 
And when I do 
I'll see you standing there 
I'll lock my heart 
To any other caress 
I'll never say yes 
To a new love affair 
Then I'll close my eyes 
To everything that's gay 
If you are not there

You won't believe me that I love you only
I'd rather be lonely than happy with somebody else

Regretting instead of forgetting with somebody else
There'll be no else unless that someone is you, you, you

And all the fellows knew,
She wouldn't bill and coo:
Ev'ry single night some smart fellow would try 
o cuddle up to her, but she would cry:
 
""Ma, he's making eyes at me!
Ma he's awful nice to me!
Ma he's almost breaking my heart,
I'm beside him, Mercy!
Let his conscience guide him!
Ma, he wants to marry me,
Be my honey bee.
Ev'ry minute he gets bolder,
Now he's leaning on my shoulder,
Ma, he's kissing me!""
 
Lilly was so good, ev'ry body could tell.
You'd never see her roam,
She'd always stay at home;
All the neighbors knew little Lilly too well.
For when the boys would call, They'd hear her yell:
 
Ma, he's making eyes at me!
Ma he's awful nice to me!
Ma he's almost breaking my heart,
If you peek in, Can't you see I'm goin' to weaken?
Ma, he wants to marry me,
Be my honey bee.
Ma, I'm meeting with resistance, 
I shall holler for assistance,
Ma, he's kissing me!""

Watch me ball, as the Dub spin like a top
I got crunk when I stopped, and made my pop trunk wop
Girls bop, automatic cause I'm top of the line
I cut my beep past six, and I raise the top of your spine
I'ma shine, Sucka Free, Boss Hogg in a row
You can catch me fresh and braided, or rugged and fro
You see the Spre's on the car, I bet you my people like the rock
When girls see Tite, Flip and Slim they say... pulling cameras out
Damn I'm hot, when I hit the club I'm bound to line to the bar
And for the first hundred people, I'm insuring they car
Attracting your star, cause nigga my piece attracting your car
We got too much green, and that's real by far

[Chorus]
You balling
If you got Sprewell rims, and they crawling
If you got four five, Clarions balling
You hit the club on dubs, and your name
They be calling, calling, calling, calling
You balling
If you push a candy color, with butter on cutters
You got a flock of girls, and they all know each other
With the command of your voice, they all
Become lovers, lovers, lovers, lovers

[Mike Jones]
I can catch boppers like Paul Wall, with the wood out my grill
I can do a girl wrong, and she goin' be by me still
I can get caught cheating on my feet, maybe she will
Never leave, cause I be spitting my game so real
I'm Mike Jones (who), Mike Jones Jones
That's been a baller, before I even grabbed a microphone
Swishahouse, Swishablast no more minimum wage
Independently paid, living lovely and laid
I never ever cheap talk, cause I got a platinum grill
I changed the game over, with Sprewells on my fifth wheel
My album Who Is Mike Jones, coming soon
My album Who Is Mike Jones, coming soon
Already, I pull up on Perellis with wood leather and grape jelly
T.V.'s falling down, watching DMX in Belly
Swishahouse Swishablast, we come first not last
Police pull me over, so they could play my Dreamcast
And my Xbox, I got stubborn rims
They keep going, even when I say stop (man)
Mike Jones in your ear, they gave me MVP
And this is just rookie year (Mike Jones)
Is a baller baby, shot caller baby
In the Lex having sex, twenties crawling baby
I stay balling, T.V.'s stay falling, 23's stay crawling
I'm the definition of balling playboy (man)

[Chorus]

[Magno]
My rims spinning, I swear I got me Sprewell shoes
I hop out, wearing And 1 Sprewell shoes
I'm moving slow like freewells move, I chop the block so hard
Them niggas bopping, like them females do
It's Magnificent, I'm acting bad with Slim and Mike
I'm that boy that you see, rolling them rims you like
I'm pimping dykes, either wearing Tim's or Nike's
Haters see I'm trying to shine, they want to dim my light
But can't do it, cause I shine too bright
(say man what kind of rims you got), whatever kind you like
And best believe, that twelve be in the trunk
Yo and if I'm in the Benz, it's a 12 with a V in the front
Wood grain, leather black seats
Magno with no cash flow, is like Luke without his gaped teeth
So forget, what my Porsche cost
Just realize I got enough do', to pay for R. Kelly's court costs

[Chorus]

[Slim Thug]
I played a lot of blocks, so my cash stack fast
I got a lot of rocks, and I ain't talking bout crack
Slim Thug's a high roller, and I ain't talking bout dice
See I got a lot of cars, and they ain't nothing nice
When it come to balling, I'm a vet in this shit
Every time I get a car, I'm wetting the bitch
Street rich young stunner, I don't play no games
I switch cars three times, and stay on swings
I'm respected, got the cost of a house on my necklace
That boy reckless, straight out of Texas
I ain't goin' talk about my Sprewells, why yall know I got em
I ain't goin' talk about my diamonds, cause I know why yall spot em
Why yall want to know what I claim, bitch read my piece
You want to know if we ball, bitch read my teeth
Ha, I'm Slim Thugger, that name ring bells
Everything Slim touch, guaranteed to sell, bitch I'm

Neglecting my nuts I work too much
Fuck gettin' tipsy tryin' to get fucked up

Eyes focused on pussy
Run some G on a damn broad

Catch the type of hoes that wouldn't usually sweat ya

Top down at Maxi's wit a big glock nine handy
Pieced up creased up staying dressed to impress
Big boss belt buckle under my Mitchell and Ness
Oh, Gucci shades up on my braids when I Escalade

Boss man came through, told her come inside 
Said he didn't need her service no more 
And everything she worked hard for out the door 
First thing she did is thought about the kids 
And how to pay the bills and keep food in the fridge 
She said, ""No! This ain't right!"" Looked at him and said 
""It's a cool world, and I'm destined for greatness""

Drove by the old job, seen the old boss 
Splashed water in his face, music loud and drove off 
See what he ain't know, baby girl was gifted 
Tried to hold her down, hold her back but he missed it 
She's her own boss now, she stay gettin' lifted 
Party hard with her friends, stuntin' on the fakers

They try to stop a chubby chick from comin through
My belly out and sellin out these venues
My skills, will fulfill, those who drink booze
My attitude is super cool like I'm subdued
And those who fake I take on you and your dudes
I rule the streets I break 'em down with no tools
And Misdemeanor give the finger to y'all fools (HOLLA!)
Whoever doubted that I'm 'bout it check the news
And if you snooze on me this year your ass will lose
Cause I will bruise, my loose screws is like ooh
When I come out get your release dates moved

I flow over a beat that make a chick weave blow
And those who try to compete to the wall I throw
So I drop it low, 808 kick low
Like oh oh-oh oh, oh oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Mr. Mos', this beat he compose
While I kill the track, leave your ears decomposed
Fake rappers, this year your lies will be exposed
Like oh oh-oh oh, oh Missy steal the show-ow-ow
Spit on breakbeats, make rappers lose sleep
Make labels unable drop they artists on leak
I keep 'em knee deep, need me, be me
Hardly, and basically, I do it nice and slow-ow-ow

Where would I go, who would I see in, five years from now
Tell me how will I live, will I raise some kids yeah, five years from now
Will I be locked down or will I be underground yeah, five years from now
Tell me what my future hold, it scares me not to know

It's hard to plan your future when the world goin' crazy
Kids with no food, who can they turn to
beside they own people, I swear this world evil
They see us on TV, they thinkin' we should be
The main ones providin' for our community
But the government is paid, dishin' out minimum wage
They don't care about the streets, as long as they get paid
My advice is please vote, don't take it as a joke
Cause five years from now the world could be gone in smoke
Now everybody's gone, cause they ain't stand strong
And vote for a leader that can lead our country home
We got people in Iraq, tell me why they cain't come home
If you care about your future please listen to the song
We got people in Iraq, tell me why they cain't come home
If you care about your future please listen to the song

Will I have me some kids, tell me how will I live
Will I be doin' wrong or will I live positive
Will I live to get a Grammy or will I be with my granny
Five years from now, I don't think you understand me
I'm tryin' to hold on, tryin' to stay strong
It's hard not knowin' what's really goin on
But I try to maintain, keep my head in the game
When shit ain't lookin' too good, I pray for better things
I keep the Lord on my side, 'til the day I die
Will I blow up big?  I don't know but I'll try
I keep the Lord on my side, 'til the day I die
Will I blow up big?  I don't know but I'll try

Or in the pen for ten like a con, locked up
Tell me how would I live, will I have me some kids?
Will I blow up big in showbiz, five years from now

Oh grandma, I miss you

(Mike Jones!)

April 14th was when, I felt I lost a friend
I damn near stopped rapping, damn near stopped pimpin pens
Cousin locked in the pen, when will this drama end
I get success but it feels like my stress begins
At 17 thought I was grown, had to move on
Moved out T. Jones home, had to do this on my own
My grandma left my life, I felt it wasn't right
I get awards and I break down and I cry on sight
Cause she ain't here with me, but I know she hearing me
Beg and plead, that she could still be here next to me
Even though you passed and left, yo' memories are kept
In my mind, heart, and soul, even on my shelf
Now I'm left with cousin Shelly, Jessie, and they real, and Gary
(?) and my brother, Uncle June, and my mother and
Even though sometimes I get too busy to touch you
From me to y'all I want y'all to know I love you

Oh grandma, I miss you
And wish I could kiss you and hug you girl
Ohhh grandma, I miss you
And wish I could kiss you and hug you girl
The way you used to hold me, the way you used to hold me
The way you used to show me, the way you used to show me
Befo' you left you told me, befo' you left you told me
That I was gonna have to keep the family up
(Mike Jones!)

Grandma remember when we used to play them bones and you would skunk us
And you never had a problem punking us in front of company
Wally just had a son, he's a daddy, I'ma uncle now
Wally just had a son, he's a daddy, I'ma uncle now
Latran playing ball, I pray to God he goes pro
And Gary Jr. getting bigger, I just thought I'd let you know
That the family's okay, everything's cool and straight
Juanita and Nicky just told me to tell you they said hey
And I pray day to day that the Lord'll pave the way
And you keep looking down here just smiling, just showing ya pretty face
And I still hang around my homies that you see while you were here
Oh and my girl better than ever, she too wish you was here
You know I'm grown now, so I'm putting food on the table
24 years old and I got my own label
Ice Age Entertainment, we about to take it over
T. Boy rappin now, he's Mellow, and Wally is Lil' Soldier
(?) still rolls with me, we close shoulder to shoulder
That gator that you gave my granny I use it to sew the game up
Me and (?) was partners, we both now CEO's
It's all good but I wish you was able to see me grow

Oh grandma, I miss you
And wish I could kiss you and hug you girl
Ohhh grandma, I miss you
And wish I could kiss you and hug you girl
The way you used to hold me, the way you used to hold me
The way you used to show me, the way you used to show me
Befo' you left you told me, befo' you left you told me

And I used to always tell my grandma and she used to always tell me
To use that, ya know what I'm saying?  Cause they gon' regret what they did to me
Ya know what I'm saying?  So I started using it, and it worked, ya know what I'm saying?
And.. it's it's just crazy man y'know?
I started saying my name a lot, ya know what I'm saying?
I started giving my phone number out, ya know what I'm saying?
When people was telling me that it wasn't gon' work
My grandma was telling me to do it, ya know what I'm saying?
She told she seen a vision and, that's a hell of a vision ya know what I'm saying?
And.. really I started giving out my album, I started promoting it and
All the stuff that y'all been hearing me do, I got it from her
Ya know what I'm saying?  And and that's the main reason, why I'm here today
Ya know what I'm saying?  And and it's crazy man, it's crazy y'know

So I never would of ever thought
That I'd have the whole world listening to Mike Jones, man, it's crazy man
I didn't even want to use my real name, y'know?
But grandma was like, boy you better use that name
It's gon' blow you up one day, ya know what I'm saying?
And I was like man you don't know what'chu talking about
And now I'm here, ""Who is Mike Jones?""

But I ain't move nothin', I'm on my grind hustlin'
Come at me wrong and my chrome gon' give you a concussion

I love to ride fresh, but hate to ride with Tecs
But the way that these jackers roll up, knowin' for the best
With diamonds on my neck, bulletproof vest on chest
I got my own laws, I'm here to serve and protect
Myself, because they ain't finna get me

And I don't give a damn if they rollin'
'cause my top gets folden, the AK I'm holdin'
'cause I ain't about to go down

Clothes tryin' to jack playboy
You get three slugs to ya throat and I'm fo' sho' 'cause they don't know
I'm on a mission to get paid
Tryin to plot or set me up you get ya whole block sprayed

And I ain't knockin' ya hustle but a hollow head will hurt
In the heat of the moment, let's see if that heat gon buck first
And I'm a aim for the worst to make a jacker fall flat
And if I do get jacked, you better believe
I'm comin' back in all black, CJ

So they can't out hold it

I'm down the boulevard flippin', jammin' ""Still Tippin""
See them jackers watchin' like I ain't payin' attention
But really, I'm lookin' at them boys like they silly
'cause I know their handguns ain't gon' fuck wit this Milly

'cause I'm a pistol packer for them jackers that try to attack us
No need to call the po po, 'cause my fo fo gon' be my back up
Act up, if you wanna and I swear you'll be a goner
I put it all on my mama, you niggaz don't want no drama

It's Mellow, king of the hill, don't think I ain't holdin' that steel
When I pull up in that Deville, you crumb niggaz better chill

It's sad when you down nobody lends a helping hand
But when you blow up and don't help them you ? man
My grandma told me watch these hoes because they got a plan
To get your paper that's why I keep my shit in my pants

You tried to pay for some pussy that already been bought
You told the hoe where you lived, cause you thought that the bitch was real

What ya know about that candy paint with butter guts
V-b-s, princess cuts with purple stuff up in my cup
I'm gripping on that grain man, switching lane to lane man
In my Rover Range man, like Collie on them heaven thing
I'm in the parking lot with my candy apple drop
Hop inside, press a button, watch my top pass out
See I'm a hustler on my grind, the four vogues fit for reclining
Watch me smile and show my grill so y'all can see that I'm a shine
2 8 1, 3 3 oh, eight zero zero fo'

I'm from the city of the clutch where the music screwed up
I'm switching lanes, holding grain, about to tear the curb up, baby

[Paul Wall]
What ya know about some vogue tires and 84's
Candy paint red cherry blossom dripping off the door
I'm from the place where our smiles stay iced out
Diamonds in our mouth, baby jamming on this Swishahouse
I'm Paul Wall the peoples champ, the trunk popper
I'm something like a chick magnet catching all the boppers
We used to ride choppers back in 9-8
Still jamming gray tapes in this Lone Star state
I'm from the place we be sipping on prescription cough syrup
It's some icy white shoes and a tall tee shirt
I got the trunk on crack with neon lights in the back
We still jamming Robert Davis what ya know about that baby

Pulling up holding, got the top folding
Got vogues on my lo' when I got the drop strolling
Got Now 'N' Later paint (paint)
Peter Pan guts (guts)
15's banging I can beat a man up
Big grill in the lady, gat in the waist
See the 5th wheel sleeping when I'm sliding away
Popping my trunk, you see the lights glowing
Me and Paul Wall leaning, you see the Sprite pouring
It's an H-Town thing when you riding on swings
In that candy coated frame gripping on that wood grain
You call 'em hoes, we call 'em bops
You call 'em rags, we call 'em drops

Five years from nowwwwwww
Five years from nowwwwwww

[Chorus: Lil' Bran]
Where would I go, who would I see in - five years from nowwwwwww
Tell me how will I live, will I raise some kids yeah - five years from nowwwwwww
Will I be locked down or will I be underground yeah - five years from nowwwwwww
Tell me what my future hold, it scares me not to know
what I'ma be doin - five years from nowwwwwww

[Mike Jones]
I live life daily, scared to make babies
It's hard to plan your future when the world goin crazy
Kids with no food, who can they turn to
beside they own people, I swear this world evil
They see us on TV, they thinkin we should be
The main ones providin for our community
But the government is paid, dishin out minimum wage
They don't care about the streets, as long as they get paid
My advice is please vote, don't take it as a joke
Cause five years from now the world could be gone in smoke
Now everybody's gone, cause they ain't stand strong
And vote for a leader that can lead our country home
We got people in Iraq, tell me why they cain't come home
If you care about your future please listen to the song
We got people in Iraq, tell me why they cain't come home
If you care about your future please listen to the song

[Chorus]

[Mike Jones]
I think about my homies, I think about my momma
I think about what's goin on I think about the drama
I think about the world, I think about my life
Five years from now, will I have me a wife?
Will I have me some kids, tell me how will I live
Will I be doin wrong or will I live positive
Will I live to get a Grammy or will I be with my granny
Five years from now, I don't think you understand me
I'm tryin to hold on, tryin to stay strong
It's hard not knowin what's really goin on
But I try to maintain, keep my head in the game
When shit ain't lookin too good, I pray for better thangs
I keep the Lord on my side, 'til the day I die
Will I blow up big?  I don't know but I'll try
I keep the Lord on my side, 'til the day I die
Will I blow up big?  I don't know but I'll try

[Chorus]

[Mike Jones]
How could you think about the future when the world goin crazy
Kids havin kids, they too young to make babies
I'm livin in the world so sheisty and shady... Mike Jones, Jones
Five years from now will I be dead, boxed up
Or in the pen for ten like a con, locked up
Tell me how would I live, will I have me some kids?
Will I blow up big in showbiz, five years from now

[Chorus]

Where would I go.. where would I stay..

DJ Slice, turn me up mayne, turn me up
This heah for my grandma mayne, I love you baby
The whole family miss you baby
I'm fin' ta tell the world, how important you was to me

Oh grandma, I miss you
And wish I could kiss you and hug you girl
Oh grandma, I miss you
And wish I could kiss you and hug you girl
The way you used to hold me, the way you used to hold me
The way you used to show me, the way you used to show me
Befo' you left you told me befo' you left you told me
That I was gonna have to keep the family up
(Mike Jones!)

April 14th was when, I felt I lost a friend
I damn near stopped rappin', damn near stopped pimpin' pens
Cousin locked in the pen, when will this drama end?
I get success but it feels like my stress begins
At 17 thought I was grown, had to move on
Moved out Jones home, had to do this on my own
My grandma left my life, I felt it wasn't right
I get awards and I break down and I cry on sight
My grandma left my life, I felt it wasn't right
I get awards and I break down and I cry on sight
My grandma left my life, I felt it wasn't right
I get awards and I break down and I cry on sight

'Cause she ain't here wit me, but I know she hearin' me
Beg and plead, that she could still be here next to me
Even though you passed and left, yo' memories are kept
In my mind, heart, and soul even on my shelf
Now I'm left with cousin Jessie and
Me and my brother June, my mother and
Even though sometimes I get too busy to touch you
From me to y'all I want y'all to know I love you

Oh grandma, I miss you
And wish I could kiss you and hug you girl
Oh grandma, I miss you
And wish I could kiss you and hug you girl
The way you used to hold me, the way you used to hold me
The way you used to show me, the way you used to show me
Befo' you left you told me, befo' you left you told me
That I was gonna have to keep the family up
(Mike Jones!)

Grandma remember when we used to play
Them bones and you would skunk us
And you never had a problem punkin' us in front of company
Wally just had a son he's a daddy, I'ma uncle now
Wally just had a son he's a daddy, I'ma uncle now
Latran playin' ball, I pray to God he goes pro

And Gary Jr. gettin' bigger, I just thought I'd let you know
That the family's okay, every thang's cool and straight
Juanita and Nicky just told me to tell you they said, “Hey”
And I pray day to day that the Lord'll pave the way
And you keep lookin' down here just smilin', just showin' ya pretty face
And I still hang around my homies that you see while you were here
Oh and my girl better than ever, she too wish you was here

You know I'm grown now, so I'm puttin' food on the table
24 years old and I got my own label
Ice age entertainment, we about to take it over
T. Boy rappin' now he's mellow, and Wally is lil' soldier
Boy still rolls with me, we close shoulder to shoulder
That gator that you gave my granny I use it to sew the game up
Me and she was partners, we both now CEO's
It's all good but I wish you was able to see me grow

Oh grandma, I miss you
And wish I could kiss you and hug you girl
Oh grandma, I miss you
And wish I could kiss you and hug you girl
The way you used to hold me, the way you used to hold me
The way you used to show me, the way you used to show me
Befo' you left you told me, befo' you left you told me
That I was gonna have to keep the family up

Try to get people to listen to my CD, you know?
And they be like who are you? And I'm like Mike Jones
And they'd be like who y'knahmsayin'?

And I used to always tell my grandma
And she used to always tell me
To use that y'knahmsayin'?
'Cause they gon' regret what they did to me y'knahmsayin'?
So I started usin' it, and it worked y'knahmsayin'?

And it's it's just crazy mayne y'know?
I started sayin' my name a lot y'knahmsayin'?
I started givin' my phone number out y'knahmsayin'?
When people was tellin' me that it wasn't gon' work

She told she seen a vision and, that's a hell of a vision y'knahmsayin'?

And really I started givin' out my album, I started promotin' it
And all the stuff that y'all been hearin' me do

But I ain't move nothin', I'm on my grind hustlin'
Come at me wrong and my chrome gon' give you a concussion

I love to ride fresh, but hate to ride with Tecs
But the way that these jackers roll up, knowin' for the best
With diamonds on my neck, bulletproof vest on chest
I got my own laws, I'm here to serve and protect
Myself, because they ain't finna get me
I'm in the club sober as fuck and you won't catch me tipsy

The way that I pull up, I got the jackers lookin' at me
24's and swingers, sold the candy and got me caffie
And I don't give a damn if they rollin'
'Cuz my top gets folden, the AK I'm holdin'
'Cuz I ain't about to go down

Presidential when we ride with the trunk open heat
Clothes tryin' to jack playboy
You get three slugs to ya throat and I'm fo' sho' 'cuz they don't know
I'm on a mission to get paid
Tryin to plot or set me up you get ya whole block sprayed

And I ain't knockin' ya hustle but a hollow head will hurt
In the heat of the moment, let's see if that heat gon buck first
And I'm a aim for the worst to make a jacker fall flat
And if I do get jacked, you better believe
I'm comin' back in all black, CJ

Even though the laws patrollin'

So they can't out hold it
'Cuz I ain't about to go down

Even though the laws patrollin'

'Cuz I ain't about to go down

I'm down the boulevard flippin', jammin' ""Still Tippin""
See them jackers watchin' like I aint payin' attention
But really, I'm lookin' at them boys like they silly
'Cuz I know their handguns ain't gon' fuck wit this Milly

'Cuz I'm a pistol packer for them jackers that try to attack us
No need to call the po po, 'cuz my fo fo gon' be my back up
Act up, if you wanna and I swear you'll be a goner
I put it all on my mama, you niggaz don't want no drama

It's Mellow, king of the hill, don't think I ain't holdin' that steel
When I pull up in that Deville, you crumb niggaz better chill
I'm from the streets I'm real, I grind hard for the scrill
I major without a deal, gotta keep it hot wheels

Smoke somethin', bitch!

Young Pimp, know what we doin'? (Texas!)

[Chorus: Pimp C]
Smokin' out, pourin' up, puttin' dick up in yo' slut
All my cars got leather and wood, in my hood we call it buck
Smokin' out, pourin' up, puttin' dick up in yo' slut
All my cars got leather and wood, in my hood we call it buck
Smokin' out, pourin' up, puttin' dick up in yo' slut

I'm smokin' out, pourin' up, keepin lean up in my cup
All my cars got leather and wood, in my (uh!) hood we call it

[Pimp C]
Grippin' grain, switchin' lanes, sellin' cocaine outta' candy thang
Jammin' Lil' Wayne, gotta trunk of bang, 'cause I'ma ""Hot Boy"", gotta hot flame
And my hoes pay me, just like Baby, that's the only way they can lay me
Niggas shoot slugs but they ain't graze me, they want Sweet Jones be pushin daisies
But you slow and lazy, you can't fade me, that's the reason I knock ya lady
How you gon' pimp wit'cha dick up in her? I told the pimp God that you was a sinner
You takin' these square hoes out to dinner, the bitch chose me 'cause she want a winner
I mix her whole head up like a blender, hoe need a daddy, you see pretender
I used to be a young drug dealer, now I'ma young girl stealer
I hit the streets like just like Steve Jackson, nigga say my name watch the priest reaction
Sweet Jones or Sweet James? Switched my name and finger fucked the game
The nigga fell off 'cause his raps are shitty, plus a nigga need to move up out the city
The game gritty but the bitch pretty, lemme snatch the white girl up off ya titty
Ya heard me right, I play wit' what I knows
Wear platinum piece and wit' the Gucci clothes
Paid my dues, I ain't came to lose, I wear Marvin Blackman tennis shoes
In the winter time, mink coat to match and they on the floor wit' my candy 'Lac

[Chorus]

[Mike Jones]
Uh! I'm comin' out in that candy thang, 8 carats in my pinky rang
Drop the top in the parking lot so y'all can see where the deserts swang
Candy paint what I'm flippin' on, 84's and vogues what I'm tippin' on
Momo wood grain I'm grippin' on, grippin' on
I said! Candy paint what I'm flippin' on, 84's and vogues what I'm tippin' on
Momo wood grain I'm grippin' on, codeine in cup I'm sippin' on
I hog the lane in that candy train, swangin' left and right then I turn up the bang
I'ma say it for those who don't know my name, know my name
They call me Mike Jones and I blew up quick, Ice Age the name you can't tell by the wrists?
I sit on buck in that candy 6, and I keep that thing real handy bitch!
I keep it trill like Pimp and Bun, do hoes bad and leave 'em on the run
'Cause I don't got no love for 'em but hard dick and bubble gum!
I said! I keep it trill like Pimp and Bun, do hoes bad and leave 'em on the run
'Cause I don't got no love for 'em but hard dick and bubble gum!
I said! I keep it trill like Pimp and Bun, do hoes bad and leave 'em on the run
'Cause I don't got no love for 'em but hard dick and bubble gum!

[Chorus]

[Bun B]
When I pull the slab out and hit the block, wit' them 4's and vogues they clankin' out
When they trunks pop, drop the top, don't be surprised you can go in shock
Wit' them neon lights, candy paint, belts and buckles across the back
Don't disrespect or call this a Cadi', maybe this more than just a 'Lac
Some like it white but I'ma go to green, purple dro up in the swisha
Horny ladies sittin' on the grill, wood grain to grip it's hard to miss us
We ""G"" so don't dismiss us, been here before gon' be here later
Down wit' that you understand the G Code and if you don't then you see hater
Insult, I can't roll wit'cha, it ain't how I do it man
I'm from Texas, P.A. to be exact where we screw it man {*screwed*}
U.G.K. for life is the family, that's how we get down
Bring them trill niggas to ya hood and shut ya shit down
Playa you need to sit down, you outta' ya league
Tryna keep up wit' the trill, you just might die of fatigue
You can't carry the load, you can't handle the weight
Not like them boys up out that Lone Star state so get it straight

Part of me wanna mess around
Part of me wanna keep it real
Part of me wanna hold you close
And love you from head to toe
Part of me wanna change my mind

But something is telling me that I should leave

What hurts the most is when we started out
It was cool it was everything that love's about
But something happened
Cause I'm feeling so burned out
Because I can't understand you now
I just can't understand you now

A part of me says I can't do that

She lookin' like my wife thang, boy I need one of those
Girl it's not a slice thang, ask bout me runnin'
My heart in the trap, got my money on my mind
But when I got you in my lap, we be far from killing time
And they say that opposites attract, but we both on our grind
I love to touch you from the back, tell whats up and never mind

A young black Peyton manning in the rap gettin' his snaps
And also, he only rides in the year that he's in
'Cause he don't feel the year's bigger than him, so, let the boy be

He off the meter with tennis shoes and a white tee
Bitches watchin' him thinkin', ""What if he wife me?""
And it's a certain kind of swagger you get
Especially when you're used to bein' the shit, that's if you're older right

When a nigga hug all on ya and he be smellin' like a motorbike
A nice fit and video on the TV'll
Get her to come out of them B.B.'s, believe me

Save all the talkin' 'cause you blowin' my high, boy

Yo, my Chevy ridin' high, boy
Twelve hundred dollar shades on my eyes, boy
Twelve thousand dollar blades on my ride, boy
Four 18's got me soundin' like a queer, boy

I slow the car down and speed it up
Hey, chump, I slowed your broad down and beat it up
So don't be playin' wit' a G, shawty
'Cause I can make you disappear for a G, shawty

They always talk about the kid in the street, shawty
The kid got more beef than the meat market
Let me park it 'cause I don't trust valet wit' my keys
Let's make a bet for fifty large, who flyer than me? Nobody

I'm a fly boy, I'm a, I'm a fly boy
I'm a fly boy, I'm a, I'm a fly boy
I'm a fly boy, I'm a, I'm a fly boy
Save all the talkin' 'cause you blowin' my high, boy

I'm a fly boy, I'm a, I'm a fly boy
I'm a fly boy, I'm a, I'm a fly boy
I'm a fly boy, I'm a, I'm a fly boy

But I got love for the West Coast, all day
So I suppose I'ma head out to Cali, the land of the low-lows

Touch down in LAX and I don't need no car
Robbie Chino pick me up with the bud and the bar
In the hood I'm a star so to the hood I'ma go
With Mike Jones and Snoop Dogg and they already know

That I get love from the be's, love from the see's
Mexican, Asian and Samoa OG's
Throw it up when they see me and holla, ?Hey Bun!?
When I'm comin? out in Soul Assassin Grey One

You might see me at Long Beach or maybe Pasadena
Inglewood, I.E. or West Covina

Yeah them Cali boys, we love them low-lows
An? real car club members bang they low doors
And take photos, see everything is fine

Yeah man, let me explain somethin' to you one time, man
Low ridin' is not a sport, it's a way of life
It?s like buildin' a car from scratch, you understand me

You gotta put the fresh paint on it
You gotta put the mustard and mayonnaise
That's the tires, you understand me
You gotta put the chrome on it
A little gold on it, you understand me
It?s gotta be a hundred spokes or better, ya dig?

An' you gotta drop the top
You gotta put the switches on the motherfucker
You definitely got to have a beat
And when you hit the streets you gotta have a freak
You know what I'm sayin'
One of the side, two on the be-sack
That's how it's gotta go down man
That's real lowridin?, you understand me

From a West Coast motherfuckin' G man

Born and raised on the stead block, braids no dreadlocks
Married to the hood, me and Scenic Woods wedlock
Acres Homes my home, I'm a Northside veteran
Repping H-Town, smoking, sipping on some medicine
Ain't nobody better than the boss when I floss
It's Slim Thugga motherfucker, still breaking boys off

And it's looking like you haters and you fakes is imitating us
Shaded up, braided up, and I bet that truck be bladed up

Home of the 84's and vogues and the purple drank

Yeh this the city that's slow, the city that's thowed
The city where the boys flip the candy painted low
The city where they blow big killa and stayed blowed
Hustling ass D-boys got the game sewed
Where they sip that paint (sip that paint) and drip that paint (drip that paint)
And drop that top (drop that top) and grip that grain (hold up)

That's why I know what she thinkin' when she thinkin' nigga
Right now she wanna grab a pint of oil
I brought her here to let her taste it now I ask for it
She love them Houston Oilers she love the drank we sip
She love the way the candy shine and how the 4's flip
She know bout super pokers she know bout elbows
That's why when she see 'em she can't keep her legs closed

You don't be leavin me messages like you mad as hell
You tell me that your pussy's wet and you're thinking bout me
You know that you want it and you really just can't live without me
And I'll be glad to come but after that yo I got to go

Don't have patience for no naggin' ass broad
The one who ignore you when your dick get hard
They know when your dough run low so they be frontin'
They don't give you no pussy if you don't give them no money
But you know what time it is when I'm in your spine with this
You know that you'll never find a dick like I possess
You feel it all in your chest
Sometime it hurt but you can't help but say yes
As I push this dick all up in your bush
Bust a couple of nuts and then I fire up the kush
You put on your panties I put on my drawers
We'll holla next week when the sun falls

Icey
Why they got to hate on me?
(I don't know, I guess they love my swag, love my swag, love my swag)
Ha ha who? Mike Jones! Who? Mike Jones! Who? Mike Jones!
(? You a fool with this one)
I got a question:
(why they got to hate on me?) I wonder why
(why they got to hate on me) ay, ay (why they got to hate on me)
I wonder why (why they got to hate on me) ??

[VERSE 1]
I swear to god I came from nothing to something
I ain't get no handouts I got mine from hustling
Hustlin from nothing to something
I had to get it no time to play with it, my money I was committed
And when I got my paper, my paper, I split it
When everybody ?? was down with it
But all of a sudden everybody start hatin (why they hatin)
I don't know, why everybody hatin'
They see me on them 22s givin boys the blues
When they see me shinin they don't have a clue
They be like who is that? I be like Mike Jones!
I'm like Pimp see - I got a (Pocket Full of Stones)
But it ain't work, homie it's my CD's
And I sold about 2 million in the streets
So why they hatin me? 'cause I pull up Jet Li
With the eighty fos and fos on that new Bentley
So I ask:

[CHORUS (Tanya Herron)]
Why they got to hate on me? Why they got to hate on me
(I wonder why) why they got to hate on me?
(I wonder why I wonder why)
Why they got to hate on me? Why they got to hate on me?
Why they got to hate on me?

[VERSE 2]
I spent a half million in the city baby (how much)
A half billion in the city baby
'97 ? boxster know how much I spent
I swear to god when it come to paper I ain't got no mint
When people needed money they'd holla at me
I swear to god when they needed it they holla'd at me
Club ice age I put everyone on they feet
Then they turn around and ? damn
I see y'all out there hatin on me
But I got the world waitin on me
They waitin on me why are they haiting on me
I ask the lawd but I ain't trippin get inside the booth and press record
I'm a g and these streets said that I ain't got to answer to nobody
Especially the ones with no ? so far ahead that they can't catch up
Why they wastin os on me tryin to set me up?

[CHORUS Repeats]

[VERSE 3]
Tell me, what have I done to you? What have I done to you
To make you all hate on me ay ay
What have I done to you what have I done to you
To make y'all hate on me
They see me shinin in the limelight
They see me shinin by myself and they say that I ain't right
Why is it that I had to grind on my own baby
V12 yeah I'm rollin on that chrome baby
I know he mad 'cause he lyin ? my name in your brain
I pull a wide frame I'm about to take your dame
I pull a piece of chain
Pinky ring to the turning lane
Why they hate on me mane
No need to explain

o cuddle up to her, but she would cry:

Ma he's awful nice to me!
Ma he's almost breaking my heart,
I'm beside him, Mercy!
Let his conscience guide him!
Ma, he wants to marry me,
Be my honey bee.
Ev'ry minute he gets bolder,
Now he's leaning on my shoulder,
Ma, he's kissing me!""

You know I'm yours for just the taking

Jammin' Lil' Wayne, gotta trunk of bang, 'cause I'ma ""Hot Boy"", gotta hot flame
And my hoes pay me, just like Baby, that's the only way they can lay me
Niggas shoot slugs but they ain't graze me, they want Sweet Jones be pushin daisies
But you slow and lazy, you can't fade me, that's the reason I knock ya lady
How you gon' pimp wit'cha dick up in her? I told the pimp God that you was a sinner
You takin' these square hoes out to dinner, the bitch chose me 'cause she want a winner
I mix her whole head up like a blender, hoe need a daddy, you see pretender
I used to be a young drug dealer, now I'ma young girl stealer
I hit the streets like just like Steve Jackson, nigga say my name watch the priest reaction
Sweet Jones or Sweet James? Switched my name and finger fucked the game
The nigga fell off 'cause his raps are shitty, plus a nigga need to move up out the city
The game gritty but the bitch pretty, lemme snatch the white girl up off ya titty
Ya heard me right, I play wit' what I knows
Wear platinum piece and wit' the Gucci clothes
Paid my dues, I ain't came to lose, I wear Marvin Blackman tennis shoes
In the winter time, mink coat to match and they on the floor wit' my candy 'Lac

Drop the top in the parking lot so y'all can see where the deserts swang

Momo wood grain I'm grippin' on, grippin' on
I said! Candy paint what I'm flippin' on, 84's and vogues what I'm tippin' on
Momo wood grain I'm grippin' on, codeine in cup I'm sippin' on
I hog the lane in that candy train, swangin' left and right then I turn up the bang
I'ma say it for those who don't know my name, know my name
They call me Mike Jones and I blew up quick, Ice Age the name you can't tell by the wrists?
I sit on buck in that candy 6, and I keep that thing real handy bitch!
I keep it trill like Pimp and Bun, do hoes bad and leave 'em on the run
'Cause I don't got no love for 'em but hard dick and bubble gum!
I said! I keep it trill like Pimp and Bun, do hoes bad and leave 'em on the run
'Cause I don't got no love for 'em but hard dick and bubble gum!

When I pull the slab out and hit the block, wit' them 4's and vogues they clankin' out
When they trunks pop, drop the top, don't be surprised you can go in shock
Wit' them neon lights, candy paint, belts and buckles across the back
Don't disrespect or call this a Cadi', maybe this more than just a 'Lac
Some like it white but I'ma go to green, purple dro up in the swisha
Horny ladies sittin' on the grill, wood grain to grip it's hard to miss us
We ""G"" so don't dismiss us, been here before gon' be here later
Down wit' that you understand the G Code and if you don't then you see hater
Insult, I can't roll wit'cha, it ain't how I do it man
I'm from Texas, P.A. to be exact where we screw it man {*screwed*}
U.G.K. for life is the family, that's how we get down
Bring them trill niggas to ya hood and shut ya shit down
Playa you need to sit down, you outta' ya league
Tryna keep up wit' the trill, you just might die of fatigue
You can't carry the load, you can't handle the weight

Mike Laatz,"Now you say you're lonely
You cried the whole night through
Well you can cry me a river, cry me a river
I cried a river over you

Now you say you're sorry
For being so untrue
Well you can cry me a river, cry me a river
I cried a river over you

You drove me, nearly drove me out of my head
While you never shed a tear
Remember, I remember all that you said
Told me love was too plebeian
Told me you were through with me

And now you say you love me
Well just to prove you do
Come on and cry me a river, cry me a river
I cried a river over you

Go on and cry me a river, cry me a river

I'm as helpless as a kitten up a tree
And I feel like I'm clinging to a cloud
I can't understand

Walk my way
And a thousand violins begin to play
Or it might be the sound of your hello
That music I hear
I get misty the moment you're near

You can say that you're leading me on
But it's just what I want you to do
Don't you realize how hopelessly I'm lost
That's why I'm following you

Would I wander through this wonderland alone

When you're in my arms and I feel you so close to me

Coming in on a wing and a prayer

But a man could break both his legs""

Just a vague flirtation
Or extra special company?

There ours shall go singing
