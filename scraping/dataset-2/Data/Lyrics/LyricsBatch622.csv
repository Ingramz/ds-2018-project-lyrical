Lou Busch & His Orchestra,"Ask the sky above and ask the earth below
Why I'm so in love and why I love you so
Couldn't tell you though I tried dear
Just why dear I'm yours
When you went away you left a glowing spark
Trying to be gay is whistling in the dark
I am only what you make me
Come take me, I'm yours how happy
I would be to beg or borrow or sorrow with you
Even though I knew tomorrow you'd say we were through
If we drift apart then I'll be lost alone
Though you used my heart just for a stepping stone
How can I help dreaming of you
I love you I'm yours
If we drift apart then I'll be left alone
Though you used my heart just for a stepping stone
How can I help dreaming of you
I love you I'm yours",I'm Yours,2009

Tingle tingle when we mingle
Just for fun
Let's pretend we'll never end
What we've begun
For if we play at love we may stay in love
Then you'll be glad you tried it just for fun

Lou Busch & His Orchestra,"April showers, overhead offer me a chance
To protect her from the rain and cultivate romance
It's an opportunity, something to enjoy
Helter, skelter fly for shelter I'm a lucky boy
 
Rain, let us cuddle while the rain pitter-patters 
On the pane and we're alone
A chance to while away a dreamy afternoon
A lovely peaceful afternoon 
No one can see us
Rain It's so cozy in the rain
There's no reason to complain she'll wait for you
To hold her hand and then it's ten to one
You kiss her in the rain, rain, rain
 
Rain, let us cuddle while the rain pitter-patters 
On the pane and we're alone

Until you find her eyes constantly haunt you
Until no other lips can ever thrill you

Don't say you've been in love for it isn't true

You may be sorry
For what you've done
To my poor heart;
And you may regret
Those vows that you've broken,
And the things that you did to me
That made us drift apart.

Oh, you're happy now,
And you can't see how
Those weary blues
Will ever come to you;
But as you sow,
So shall you reap, dear;
And what you reap
Will gonna make you weep,
Someday, sweetheart!

There's no sun up in the sky
Stormy weather
Since my man and I ain't together
Keeps rainin' all the time

Gloom and misery everywhere

Just can't get my poor self together
I'm weary all the time, the time
So weary all the time

When he went away, the blues walked in and met me
If he stays away, old rocking chair will get me

Walk in the sun once more

Can't go on
All I have in life is gone

Since my man and I ain't together
Keeps rainin' all the time

I walk around, heavy-hearted and sad
Night comes around, I'm still feelin' bad
Rain pourin' down, blindin' every hope I had
This pitterin', patterin', beatin' and spatterin' drives me mad
Love, love, love, love
This misery is just too much for me

Lou Busch & Orchestra,"Met the man I love
In a town way down in Dixie
'Neath the stars above
He was the sweetest man you ever did see

When he held me in his arms
And told me of my many charms
He kissed me while the fiddles played
The Bonaparte's retreat

All the world was bright
When he held me on that night
And I heard him say
""Please don't ever go away""

Lou Caputo,"It seems like a dream, yet I know it happened
A man, a maid, a kiss, and then goodbye
Romance was the theme
And we were the players
I never think of this without a sigh
 
Lover, one lovely day
Love came, planning to stay
Green Dolphin Street supplied the setting
The setting for nights beyond forgetting
And through these moments apart memories live in my heart
When I recall the love I found on
I could kiss the ground on Green Dolphin Street

Or maybe, way beyond the distant star
How I wish, I knew

Would you promise to be true
And help me understand?
Cause I've been in love before
And I found that love was more
Than just holding hands
If I give my heart to you,

From the very start
That you,
Would love me more than her
If I trust in you oh please,
Don't run and hide
If I love you too oh please
Don't hurt my pride like her,
Cause I couldn't stand the pain
And I,
Would be sad if our new love,
Was in vain

And it don't seem so long ago

Lou Christy,"Way down Louisiana close to New Orleans,
Way back up in the woods among the evergreens...
There stood a log cabin made of earth and wood,
Where lived a country boy name of Johnny B. Goode...
He never ever learned to read or write so well,
But he could play the guitar like ringing a bell.

Go Go
Go Johnny Go
Go Go
Johnny B. Goode

He used to carry his guitar in a gunny sack
And sit beneath the trees by the railroad track.
Oh, the engineers used to see him sitting in the shade,
Playing to the rhythm that the drivers made.
People passing by would stop and say
Oh my that little country boy could play

His mama told him someday he would be a man,
And he would be the leader of a big old band.
Many people coming from miles around
To hear him play his music when the sun go down
Maybe someday his name would be in lights
Saying Johnny B. Goode tonight.",Johnny B. Goode,

Gonna find out who's naughty and nice

He knows when you're a wake
He knows if you've been bad or good

And curly head dolls that toddle and coo
Elephants, boats, and kiddie cars too
Santa Claus is comin' to town
Then kids in Girl and Boy land will have a jubilee
They're gonna build a Toyland all around the Christmas tree
So! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
 
Now Santa is a busy man, He has no time to play
He's got millions of stockings to fill on Christmas day
You'd better write your letter now
And mail it right away
Because he's getting ready
His reindeer's and his sleigh. So

Thank God not as often as I used to
Slow and heavy from dreams with you
You've found a way back in
Once again my long lost friend
Funny to see that after all these years*I miss you the same

So I drag myself to the corner café
And for a second I see you there
Like in the good old days
And I wonder what you're doing ?
What are you up to these days ?
I sometimes wish you would call me
But then I wouldn't know what to say

And I see you, in every cab that goes by, in the strangers at every cross road, in every bar (bis)

It takes a glass or two
For it to settle down
For your shadows to stop following me
Around
I find myself walking back
To all the places we knew
Dreaming and wishing
To somehow run into you

And of course I wonder
Does it happen to you ?
Does my ghost ever come looking for you ?

That to me is what your eyes are,
Soft as stars in April skies are,
Tell me some day you'll fulfill
Their promise of a thrill.

Star eyes,
Flashing eyes in which my hopes rise,
Let me show you where my heart lies.
Let me prove that it adores
That loveliness of yours.

All my life I've felt
Content to stargaze at the skies.
Now I only want to to melt
The stardust in your eyes.

If it's me for whom those eyes glow?
Makes no diff'rence where you are,
Your eyes still hold my wishing star,
Oh, star eyes, how lovely you are.",Star Eyes,1957

And you'll be met there by others like you
Brothers as blue

More of your kind

Where funny people can have fun

Darling

Before you can count up
One, two, three.

With a wishing well

I wish that we were there together
There's a bridal suite
One room bright and neat
Complete for us to
Share together

You can see a distant steeple
Not a sign of people who
Wants people?

And now it's nice to live
Paradise to live

I know why I've waited

Prayed each night for someone
Exactly like you

Why should we spend money
On a show or two
No one does those love scenes
Exactly like you

What my love is to me.

""Candy""
I call my sugar ""Candy""
Because I'm sweet on ""Candy""
And ""Candy"" is sweet on me

He/She understands me,
My understanding ""Candy""

I wish that there were four of him/her
So I could love much more of him/her

Lou Donaldson,"A country dance was being held in a garden
I felt a bump and heard an ""Oh, beg your pardon""
Suddenly I saw polka dots and moonbeams
All around a pug-nosed dream

The music started and was I the perplexed one
I held my breath and said ""May I have the next one?""
In my frightened arms, polka dots and moonbeams
Sparkled on a pug-nosed dream

There were questions in the eyes of other dancers
As we floated over the floor
There were questions but my heart knew all the answers
And perhaps a few things more

Now in a cottage built of lilacs and laughter
I know the meaning of the words ""Ever after""
And I'll always see polka dots and moonbeams
When I kiss the pug-nosed dream",Polka Dots and Moonbeams,1961

And a hand to hold when leaves begin to fall,
And a love whose burning light to warm the winter night, that's all, that's all.
There are those I am sure who have told you,
They will give you the world for a toy.
All I ask for these arms to enfold you, and a love, time can never destroy.

Like the tide at its ebb I'm at peace in the web of your arms
 
First the tide rushes in, plants a kiss on the shore
Then rolls out to sea and the sea is very still once more
So I rush to your side like the oncoming tide 
With one burning thought, will your arms open wide?
At last face to face, and as we kiss through an embrace 
I can tell, I can feel you are love, you are real
Really mine in the rain, in the dark, in the sun
Like the tide at its ebb I'm at peace in the web of your arms",Ebb Tide,1977
Lou Donaldson,"Ever since the lucky night I found you
I've hung around you just like a fool
Falling head and heels in love like a kid out of school.

My poor heart is in an awful state now
But it's too late now to call a halt

So if I become a nuisance it's all your fault!

Don't blame me for falling in love with you
I'm under your spell but how can I help it!
Don't' blame me!

Can't you see when you do the things you do!
If I can't conceal the thrill that I'm feeling,
Don't blame; me.

Ican't help it if that doggoned moon above
Makes me need someone like you to love!

Blame your kiss as sweet as a kiss can be
And blame all your charms that melt in my arms
But don't blame me.

I like every single thing about you
Without a doubt you are like a dream
In my mind I find a picture of us as a team

Ever since the hour of our meeting
I've been repeating a silly phrase
Hoping that you'll understand me one of these days.

Don't blame me for falling in love with you
I'm under your spell but how can I help it!
Don't' blame me!

Can't you see when you do the things you do!

Lou Donaldson,"In a dream the strangest and the oddest things appear
And what insane and silly things we do
Here is what I see before me, vividly and clear
As I recall it, you were in it, too

I had the craziest dream last night, yes I did
I never dreamt it could be
Yet there you were, in love with me
I found your lips close to mine so I kissed you
And you didn't mind it at all
When I'm awake such a break never happens
How long can a gal go on dreaming?

If there's a chance that you care
Then, please, say you do, Baby
Say it and make my craziest dream come true",I Had the Craziest Dream,1991

Don't you know each cloud contains pennies from heaven?

If you want the things you love, you must have showers
So, when you hear it thunder, don't run under a tree
There'll be pennies from heaven for you and me

Every time, every time it rains, it's gonna rain pennies from heaven
Don't you know every cloud contains lots of pennies from heaven

Lou Donaldson,"When the mellow moon begins to beam,
Every night I dream a little dream,
And of course Prince Charming is the theme,
The he for me.
Although I realize as well as you
It is seldom that a dream comes true,
To me it's clear
That he'll appear.

Some day he'll come along,
The man I love
And he'll be big and strong,
The man I love
And when he comes my way
I'll do my best to make him stay.

He'll look at me and smile
I'll understand,
And in a little while,
He'll take my hand,
And though it seems absurd,
I know we both won't say a word

Maybe I shall meet him Sunday
Maybe Monday, maybe not,
Still I'm sure to meet him one day
Maybe Tuesday will be my good news day

He'll build a little home

From which I'll never roam,

Lou Donaldson,"Oh, Danny boy, the pipes, the pipes are calling
From glen to glen, and down the mountain side.
The summer's gone, and all the roses falling,
It's you, it's you must go and I must bide.

But come ye back when summer's in the meadow,
Or when the valley's hushed and white with snow,
It's I'll be here in sunshine or in shadow,
Oh, Danny boy, oh Danny boy, I love you so!

But when ye come, and all the flowers are dying,
If I am dead, as dead I well may be,
You'll come and find the place where I am lying,
And kneel and say an Ave there for me.
And I shall hear, though soft you tread above me,
And all my grave will warmer, sweeter be,
For you will bend and tell me that you love me,
And I shall sleep in peace until you come to me!",Danny Boy,1994

Lou Donaldson,"It was the third of June, another sleepy, dusty Delta day
I was out choppin' cotton and my brother was balin' hay
And at dinner time we stopped and walked back to the house to eat
And Mama hollered out the back door ""y'all remember to wipe your feet""
And then she said ""I got some news this mornin' from Choctaw Ridge""
""Today Billy Joe MacAllister jumped off the Tallahatchie Bridge""

'n' Papa said to Mama as he passed around the blackeyed peas
""Well Billy Joe never had a lick of sense, pass the biscuits, please""
""There's five more acres in the lower forty I've got to plow""
'n' Mama said it was shame about Billy Joe, anyhow
Seems like nothin' ever comes to no good up on Choctaw Ridge
And now Billy Joe MacAllister's jumped off the Tallahatchie Bridge

'n' Brother said he recollected when he and Tom and Billie Joe
Put a frog down my back at the Carroll County picture show
And wasn't I talkin' to him after church last Sunday night?
""I'll have another piece-a apple pie, you know it don't seem right""
""I saw him at the sawmill yesterday on Choctaw Ridge""
""And now ya tell me Billie Joe's jumped off the Tallahatchie Bridge""

'n' Mama said to me ""Child, what's happened to your appetite?""
""I've been cookin' all morning and you haven't touched a single bite""
""That nice young preacher, Brother Taylor, dropped by today""
""Said he'd be pleased to have dinner on Sunday, oh, by the way""
""He said he saw a girl that looked a lot like you up on Choctaw Ridge""
""And she and Billy Joe was throwing somethin' off the Tallahatchie Bridge""

A year has come 'n' gone since we heard the news 'bout Billy Joe
'n' Brother married Becky Thompson, they bought a store in Tupelo
There was a virus going 'round, Papa caught it and he died last Spring
And now Mama doesn't seem to wanna do much of anything
And me, I spend a lot of time pickin' flowers up on Choctaw Ridge
And drop them into the muddy water off the Tallahatchie Bridge",Ode to Billie Joe,1997
Lou Donaldson,"It's cherry pink and apple blossom white
When your true lover comes your way
It's cherry pink and apple blossom white
The poets say

The story goes that once a cherry tree
Beside an apple tree did grow
And there a boy once met his bride to be
Long long ago

The boy looked into her eyes, it was a sight to enthrall
The breezes joined in their sighs, the blossoms started to fall
And as they gently carressed, the lovers looked up to find
The branches of the two trees were intertwined,

And that is why the poets always write
If there's a new moon bright above
It's cherry pink and apple blossom white
When you're in love",Cherry Pink and Apple Blossom White,1999
Lou Donaldson,"Look at me
I'm as helpless as a kitten up a tree
And I feel like I'm clinging to a cloud
I can't understand
I get misty, holding your hand

Walk my way
And a thousand violins begin to play
Or it might be the sound of your hello
That music I hear
I get misty the moment you're near

You can say that you're leading me on
But it's just what I want you to do
Don't you realize how hopelessly I'm lost
That's why I'm following you

On my own
Would I wander through this wonderland alone
Never knowing my right foot from my left
My hat from my glove
I get misty, and too much in love

I'm too misty, and too much in love",Misty [#],1999
Lou Donaldson,"Someone that I belong to
Doesn't belong to me
Someone who can't be faithful
Knows that I have to be
Wonder if I am wrong to give her my loyalty

Why should I be a lone soul
Why can't I be my own soul
Alone from night to night you'll find me
Too weak to break the chains that bind me
I need no shackles to remind me
I'm just a prisner of love
For one comand I stand and wait now

From one who's master of my Fate now
I can't escape for it's too late now
I'm just a prisoner of love
What's the good of my caring if someone is sharing
Those arms with me
Although she has another
I can't have another
For I'm not free
She's in my dreams awake or sleeping
Up on my knees to her I'm creeping
My very life is in her keeping
I'm just a prisoner of love.

Lou Donaldson,"And now the purple dusk of twilight time
Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb
Always reminding me that we're apart
You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms
The nightingale 
Tells his fairytale
Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain
My stardust melody
The memory of love's refrain.",Stardust [#],1999
Lou Donaldson,"I was a stranger in the city
Out of town were the people I knew
I had that feeling of self-pity
What to do, what to do, what to do
The outlook was decidedly blue

But as I walked through the foggy streets alone
It turned out to be the luckiest day I've known

A foggy day, in London town
Had me low, had me down
I viewed the morning, with much alarm
British Museum, had lost its charm

How long I wondered,
Could this thing last
But the age of miracles, hadn't past
For suddenly, I saw you there
And through foggy London town,
The sun was shining everywhere

One little thought to me
Though someone else may be
Nearer your heart?

Once in a while will you dream
Of the moments I shared with you
Moments before we two
Drifted apart?

In love's smoldering ember
One spark may remain
If love still can remember
That spark may burn again

I know that I'll be contented
With yesterday's memory
Knowing you think of me
Once in a while

In love's smoldering ember
One spark may remain
If love still can remember
The spark may burn again

That you got married for the money

Of one twenty or more

And the ginko bal-boa?

Sometime you picture yourself getting impaled
On an imaginary spike sticking out from over your bed
When you keep forgetting to call somebody back
But the more time goes by, the less you feel like calling

And you don't want people to think you're freaky
Even though you are kind of freaky
But only in the bedroom

I don't want them growing up thinking

Couldn't get a ticket, it was a sold out show
Heard the roar of the crowd, he could picture the scene
Put his ear to the wall, then like a distant scream
He heard one guitar, just blew him away
He saw stars in his eyes, and the very next day

Bought a beat up six string, in a secondhand store
Didn't know how to play it, but he knew for sure
That one guitar, felt good in his hands, didn't take long, to understand
Just one guitar, slung way down low
Was a one way ticket, only one way to go

Like a trip through the past, to that day in the rain
And that one guitar, made his whole life change
Now he needs to keep on rockin', he just can't stop

I used to fantasize that you were mine

This love should fade, but feels the same
I can't believe, that you still think of me

Lost in the shadows
Say hello to the night
Lost in the loneliness
Say hello to the night
Lost in the shadows
No one knows

I can't wait, I can't wait, no
When I see little lights in the shadows
One must hide when the sun gets higher
I don't know what this madness means

Here comes the night, the bedroom in shadows
Candlelights, I don't know where it's coming from
But I, I keep moving on
Till the darkest thought makes me want to try these wings

Say hello to the night
Lost in the shadows
Say hello to the night
Lost in the loneliness
Say hello to the night
Lost in the shadows

Loneliness pours over you
Emptiness can pull you through
Did you go to sleep with the light on?
I can't wait for this feeling to free me

Wind blows hard, but it doesn't matter
'Cause when the sun goes down
Nothing else matters, the line is where the night lies
I will wait outside her window tonight

Say hello to the night

Say hello to the night
Lost in the loneliness
Say hello to the night

Lou Gramm,"I was standing there, watching her
While she would shoot arrows at my heart
I know there's no stopping her now
She's out to get me and boy she knows how
Like a landslide, all power going down
She took the ground out from under my feet
I knew this girl would get me right here
Where happiness and heartache meet

I'm givin' you a heartbreak warning, oh, oh, oh, oh
She's an angel with a dirty face

I let it go, at full speed
When in love it seems
You're invincible at heart
Everyday I got deeper in it
I was a victim right from the start
I didn't know, the minute she was sure
Her poison arrow had hit the bull's eye
She turned and said my dreams are out of line
And stayed around to watch them die
[chorus]
What you've been getting isn't always what you see
Love has many faces now, but in your dreams of dreams
You do believe in holding on, you got to let it go
I had enough, I stepped back
There's only so much that a man like me can take
This heart of mine is a fragile thing
Once it's in pieces there's nothing to break
Now she's crying, she's crying over me
She still can't get it through her beautiful head
That pretty smile may fool somebody else
I'll tell you baby, all I see is red

She'll be gone in the morning, oh, oh, oh, oh

I was king for just one day, that's long enough to know, I can't let go

They have an orchestra up in the trees
For their musicians are the birds and bees
And they will sing us a song
As we are strolling along
 
In sunny Roseland, where summer breezes are playing
Where the honey bees are ""A-Maying""
There all the roses are swaying
Dancing while the meadow brook flows
The moon when shining is more than ever designing
For 'tis ever then I am pining
Pining to be sweetly reclining
Somewhere in Roseland
Beside a beautiful rose
 
The ball is over and tulips meet
Their little kisses are so short and sweet
The lilies nod to the forget-me-nots
When they're departing in their flower pots
But all the roses with their spirits high
Remain to love until they droop and die
And dear, why shouldn't it be

Upon a ridge he rested as he went along his way,

A ploughin' thru the ragged skies
And up a cloudy draw.
Yippee-yi-ay, yippee-yi-o,
The ghost herd in the sky.

Their brands were still on fire and their hooves wuz made of steel,
Their horns wuz black and shiny and their hot breath he could feel,
A bolt of fear went through him as they thundered thru the sky,
For he saw the riders comin' hard
And he heard their mournful cry.

Their faces gaunt their eyes were blurred and shirts all soaked
with sweat,
They're ridin' hard to atch that herd but they ain't caught them yet

On horses snortin' fire
As they ride on, hear their cry.

Nowadays we often gaze 
On women over fifty
Without the slightest trace 
Of wrinkles on their face
Doctors go and take their dough

To tell me just why
No matter how young a prune may be
It's always full of wrinkles
We may get them on our face
Prunes get 'em every place
Prohibition worries us
But prunes don't sit and brood
For no matter how young a prune may be
It's always getting stewed

In the kingdom of the fruits
The prune is snubbed by others
And they are not allowed
To mingle with the crowd
Though they're never on display
With all their highbrow brothers
They never seem to mind
To this fact they're resigned
That no matter how young a prune may be
It's always full of wrinkles
Beauty treatments always fail
They've tried all to no avail
Other fruits are envious
Because they know real well
That no matter how young a prune may be
Hot water makes 'em swell

Baby prunes look like their dad
But not wrinkled quite as bad

Every day in every way
The world is getting better
We've even learned to fly
As days go passing by
But how about the poor old prune
His life is only wetter
No wonder he can't win
In the awful stew he's in
No matter how young a prune may be
He's always full of wrinkles
We may get them on our face
Prunes get 'em every place
Nothing ever worries them
Their life's an open book
But no matter how young a prune may be
It has a worried look

When sickly people moan
But no matter how young a prune may be
It has a heart of stone",The Song of the Prune,2003

There was nothing to block or buffer the wind, the elements
Keep them from knocking my pad down, Jim I mean really socking it to me
And the boiler would bust and the heat was gone

I would have to get fully dressed before I could go the bed

Did I tell you I need you...",Got to Get You into My Life,1971
Lou Rawls,"You know, there was a time when
If someone told you to do somethin'
You did it. Bam! Right on! 
No questions asked
It was ""Yes, sir"" and ""Yes, mam""
You never said no. You know? Huh?
But, you know
Things are changing nowadays
It's a new day babies
Folks want to take their own lives into their hands 
And make their own choices
No longer do they want to go along with the program 
'Cause everybody say it's right
You know what I mean?
Let me tell ya what I'm talkin' about, ya see, 'cause...

I don't want no gold watch for workin' fifty years from nine till five
Awhile the boss is guzzling champagne 
And I'm beltin' beer in some dive

'Cause I want to be happy and free
Livin' and loving for me
I want to be happy and free
Livin' and lovin' for me
Like a natural man (Like a natural man)
A natural man (Like a natural man)

Well now, I refuse to listen to people's thinkin' that I live too high
I'm gonna taste it now before my one life streaks on by

Lou Rawls,"When I fall in love
It will be forever
Or I'll never fall in love

In a restless world
Like this is
Love is ended before it's begun
And too many
Moonlight kisses
Seem to cool in the warmth of the sun

When I give my heart
I give it completely
Or I'll never give my heart

And the moment I can feel that you feel that way too
Is when I fall in love with you",When I Fall in Love,1971
Lou Rawls,"Just yesterday mornin', they let me know you were gone
Suzanne the plans they made put an end to you
I walked out this morning and I wrote down this song
I just can't remember who to send it to
 
I've seen fire and I've seen rain
I've seen sunny days that I thought would never end
I've seen lonely times when I could not find a friend
But I always thought that I'd see you again
 
Won't you look down upon me, Jesus 
You've got to help me make a stand
You've just got to see me through another day
My body's aching and my time is at hand
I won't make it any other way
 
I've seen fire and I've seen rain
I've seen sunny days that I thought would never end
I've seen lonely times when I could not find a friend
But I always thought that I'd see you again
 
Been walking my mind to an easy time, my back turned towards the sun
Lord knows when the cold wind blows, it'll turn your head around
Well there's hours of time on the telephone line to talk about things to come
Sweet dreams and flying machines in pieces on the ground
 
I've seen fire and I've seen rain
I've seen sunny days that I thought would never end
I've seen lonely times when I could not find a friend
But I always thought that I'd see you baby, one more time again, now

Thought I'd see you one more time again
There's just a few things coming my way this time around now
Thought I'd see you, thought I'd see you, fire and rain now
Na na na. Na na na na na na na na na na. Na na na na na na na na

Lou Rawls,"I've been so many places
In my life and time
I've sung a lot of songs
I've made some bad rhyme

With ten thousand people watching
But we're alone now and
I'm singing this song for you

I know your image of me
Is what I hope to be

You taught me precious secrets
Of the truth with holding nothing
You came out in front and I was hiding
But now I'm so much better
And if my words don't come together
Listen to the melody
'Cause my love is in there hiding

I love you in a place
Where there's no space or time
I love you for in my life
You are a friend of mine
And when my life is over
Remember when we were together
We were alone and
I was singing this song for you

And you're tired of livin' alone the way that you've been, yeah
Don't you worry, don't be shy, call me up and come on by
Just walk, walk on, walk on in

I said if you need a shoulder you can lean on, yeah
Someone to stand by you through thick and thin
Now, you just point your feet in my direction
They will know where to go
And they will walk, walk on, walk on in

I said now once you get to movin', movin'
Nothin' hurts you quite so bad
And your spirit gets to groovin', groovin'
And your heart's starts to feelin' glad
And you're thankful for all you have

So if you feel the need for someone to be with, oh yeah
To deny it would surely, surely be a sin
Sometimes all you need, all you need
Is a place where you can go
You can just walk, walk on, walk on in

Now count to three

Come with me and you'll be
In a world of pure imagination
Take a look and you'll see
Into your imagination
We'll begin with a spin
Trav'lling in a world of my creation
What we'll see will defy explanation

Simply look around and view it
Anything you want we'll do it
You want to change the world

Now sit in your easy chair
What you want, I'll bring it there

What so proudly we hail'd at the twilight's last gleaming?
Whose broad stripes and bright stars, thro' the perilous fight,
O'er the ramparts we watch'd, were so gallantly streaming?
And the rockets' red glare, the bombs bursting in air,
Gave proof thro' the night that our flag was still there.
O say, does that star-spangled banner yet wave
O'er the land of the free and the home of the brave?

On the shore dimly seen thro' the mists of the deep,
Where the foe's haughty host in dread silence reposes,
What is that which the breeze, o'er the towering steep,
As it fitfully blows, half conceals, half discloses?
Now it catches the gleam of the morning's first beam,
In full glory reflected, now shines on the stream:
'Tis the star-spangled banner: O, long may it wave
O'er the land of the free and the home of the brave!

And where is that band who so vauntingly swore
That the havoc of war and the battle's confusion
A home and a country should leave us no more?
Their blood has wash'd out their foul footsteps' pollution.
No refuge could save the hireling and slave
From the terror of flight or the gloom of the grave:
And the star-spangled banner in triumph doth wave
O'er the land of the free and the home of the brave.

O, thus be it ever when freemen shall stand,
Between their lov'd homes and the war's desolation;
Blest with vict'ry and peace, may the heav'n-rescued land
Praise the Pow'r that hath made and preserv'd us as a nation!

Come let me hold you, let's talk things out
Please let me help you, erase all of your doubts

Why don't you,
Why don't we get together tonight
So I can be good to you
I want to be good to you

'Cause I know what you want
Yes, and I know what you need, you need the same things I do
'Cause I've been hurt many times just like you

I want to be good to you, let me be good to you
While I'm being good to you baby
I want you to be good to me
We can help each other baby
Just let me be good to you

Why don't you let me be good to you
Let's always stay together
A-let me be good to you. Well

You know I was thinking today
You want to do something different tonight
Why don't you come over to my place
Let me put on some dinner for us
Get us a couple of bottles of wine
Then I can just rub your shoulders and ease 
all your tensions and your nerves from the day
As a matter of fact I'll even take your shoes off 
and rub your feet 'cause I know you've been 
on them all day and you'rel tired and their hot

So listen tell you what you do
After you get home
You know, you get yourself cooled down
Take a nice warm bath, get all relaxed and refreshed
And come on over and let me… …ease the evening for you

Let me be good to you, let me be good to you

After we have dinner maybe we can go catch a late show 
or maybe we can just stay at the place
And watch a late-night TV movie…
Yeah

There's battle lines being drawn
And nobody's right, if everybody's wrong
Young people speaking their minds
A-getting so much resistance from behind
And we stop, what's that sound
Everybody look what's goin' down

What a field day for the heat

Singin' songs and a-carryin' signs
Mostly say ""hooray for our side""

It starts when you're always afraid
Step outta line, the men come and take you away

Lou Rawls,"I just came back from a lovely trip along the Milky Way
Stopped off at the North Pole to spend a holiday
I called on dear old Santa Claus
To see what I could see
He took me to his workshop 
And told his plans to me, so

Better not pout, I'm telling you why

He's making a list and checking it twice
Gonna find out who's naughty and nice

He sees you when you're sleepin'
He knows when you're a wake
He knows if you've been bad or good
So be good for goodness sake
Oh! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why

With little tin horns and little toy drums
Rooty toot toots and rummy tum tums
Santa Claus is comin' to town
And curly head dolls that toddle and coo
Elephants, boats, and kiddie cars too
Santa Claus is comin' to town
Then kids in Girl and Boy land will have a jubilee
They're gonna build a Toyland all around the Christmas tree
So! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
 
Now Santa is a busy man, He has no time to play
He's got millions of stockings to fill on Christmas day
You'd better write your letter now
And mail it right away
Because he's getting ready
His reindeer's and his sleigh. So

How long, how long, baby how long?

Heard the whistle blowin', couldn't see the train
Way down in my heart I had an achin' pain
How long, how long, how long?

If I could holler like a mountain jack
I'd go up on the mountain and call my baby back
I went up on the mountain, looked as far as I could see
The man had my woman and the blues had poor me

I can see the green grass growin' on the hill
But I ain't seen the green grass on a dollar bill
I'm goin' down to Georgia, been up in Tennessee
So look me over baby, last you'll see of me

If I don't run into my baby, a train is goin' to run into me

Throw my heart away each Spring
Now a Spring romance
Hasn't got a chance
Promised my first dance to Winter
All I've got to show's a splinter
For my little fling

Spring, this year has got me feeling like a horse
That never left the post
I lay in my room
Starring up at the ceiling
Spring can really hang you up the most

Morning kiss wakes trees and flower
And to them my life
To drink a toast I walk in the park
Just to kill those lonely hours
Spring can really hang you up the most

All afternoon
Those birds tweet-a-tweet I know their tune
This is love this is it
Heard it before
And I know the score
And I decide that love is a bore
Love seem sure around the new year
Now it's April

Love is just a ghost
Spring arrived on time
But what became of you, dear
Spring can really hang you up the most
Spring can really hang you up the most

Spring is here
There's no mistaken
Robins build their nest from coast to coast
My heart tries the same
So they won't hear it breaking
Spring can really hang you up the most

College boys are riding somewhere
... tender passion there it grows
But I'm on the shelf with last years easter bonnet
Spring can really hang you up the most

Love came my way
I'm holding the last
We had our day
Now that's all in the past
Spring came along
A season of song
For love's sweet promise
But something went wrong
Doctor's once prescribed a tonic
Sulfur and molasses was the dose
Didn't help me a bit
My condition must be chronic
Spring can really hang you up the most

All alone, the party's over
Winter was a gracious host
But when you keep praying
For snow to hide the clover
Spring can really hang you up the most",Spring Can Really Hang You up the Most,1998

You know the family is the solution to the world's problems today
Now let's take a look at the family
In the family the father is like the head, the leader, the director
Not domineering, but showing love, guidance
For everyone else in the family
Now if we could get all the fathers of the world
To stand up and be fathers
That would be great
Then we have mothers
Who are the right arm of the father
There's supposed to-to-to do the cooking
Raise the children, do the sewing
And help the father to guide and direct
Then there's the son
The son, most sons are like imitators of their father
So we're back again to the father
And he is guiding in the right way
The son is definitely gonna be alright
Then we have the daughter
Watching her mother
Be-because sooner or later she's gonna be a mother
And she'll have her own sons and daughters
It don't, it don't just stop there with the family or
Of-of yours or mine
It's a universal family
Under one divine purpose
And one divine father
That is if we all come together no matter what color, race, creed
Because that's all in the head whether you wanna believe it or not
'Cause you'll bleed

Hoo...

It'll be nice, so nice, so nice",Family Reunion,2002

With the last breath of my soul I'll be blessing you

Your current troubles and you know they'll get much worse
I hope you know how much I enjoyed them
You're a pig of a person, there's a justice in this world
Hey, how about this?
Your lack of conscience and your lack of morality
Well, more and more people know all about it

We sat around the other night, me and the guys,
Trying to find the right word
That would best fit and describe you and people like you
That no principle has touched no principles baptized
How about that?
Who'd eat shit and say it taseted good
If there was some money in it for him

Whose name was Bobby Fuller?

The absolute corrupting power, that makes great men insane
While some people find their refreshment in action
The manipulation, encroachment and destruction of their inferiors

Some people are into sadistic pleasures
They whet their desires and drool in your ears
They're quasi-effeminate characters in love with oral gratification
They edify your integrities, so they can play on your fears

They're gonna do you in public, 'cause you're growing up in public
They're gonna do it to you in public,
'cause you're growing up in public with your pants down

Some people think being a man is unmanly
Some people think that the whole concept's a joke
But some people think being a man is the whole point
And then some people wish they'd never awoke

Down to a size neither regal nor calm
A prince hamlet caught the middle between reason and instinct
Caught in the middle with your pants down again

I'm caught in the middle, caught in the middle deciding about you

Going to public school
During recess in the concrete playground

And stickball and stoopball were the only games

And I wanted to be like my old man

I wanted to dress like, I wanted to be just like
I wanted to act like my old man
I wanted to be like, I wanted to act like

And I didn't want to be like my father anymore

And having to hide under a desk on the floor
And when he beat my mother
It made me so mad I could choke

And I didn't want to be like my old man
I, I didn't even want to look like my old man
I didn't even want to seem like my old man

And makes a vow to return only when
He is so much richer, in every way so much bigger that -

She said she never understood a word from me
Because, I know that she cares about me,

And I know that she's long, dead and gone, 
Still it ain't the same.
When I wake up in the morning, mama,
I heard her call my name.
I know she's dead and long, gone.

You can arrest me if I'm not at home
And if I don't keep my word I swear
I'll keep away

Here's Shakespeare's ""Measure For Measure""

Lou Reed,"They tied his arms behind his back
To teach him how to swim
They put blood in his coffee
And milk in his gin
They stood over the soldier
In the midst of the squalor
There was war in his body
And it caused his brain to holler

Make the sacrifice
Mutilate my face
If you need someone to kill
I'm a man without a will
Wash the razor in the rain
Let me luxuriate in pain
Please don't set me free
Death means a lot to me

The pain was lean and it made him scream
He knew he was alive
He put a pin through the nipples on his chest
He thought he was a saint
I've made love to my mother, killed my father and brother
What am I to do
When a sin goes too far, it's like a runaway car
It cannot be controlled

Spit upon his face and scream
There's no oedipus today
This is no play you're thinking you are in
What will you say
Take the blue mask down from my face
And look me in the eye
I get a thrill from punishment
I've always been that way

I loathe and despise repentance
You are permanently stained
Your weakness buys indifference
And indiscretion in the streets
Dirty's what you are and clean is what you're not
You deserve to be soundly beat

Make the sacrifice
Take it all the way
There's no ""won't"" high enough
To stop this desperate day
Don't take death away
Cut the finger at the joint
Cut the stallion at his mount
And stuff it in his mouth

If I could be anything of the things in this world that bite
Instead of being a tethered ocelot on a leash
I'd rather be your kite
And be tied to the end of your string
And flying in the air, babe, at night
Because you know what they say about honey bears
When you shave off all their baby hair
You've got a hairy minded big bare bear
And all the bells are rolling out for you
And stones are all erupting out for you
And all the cheap bloodsuckers are flying after you

Yesterday, Daisy Mae and Biff were grooving down the street
And just like in a movie, her hands became her feet
Her belly button was her mouth
Which meant she tasted what she'd speak
But the funny thing is what happened to her nose
It grew until it reached all of her toes
Now, when people say her feet smell, they mean her nose
And curtains laced with diamonds, dear, for you
And kingdom's Christian sailors (soldiers), dear, for you
And melting ice cap mountains, dear, for you
And knights in flaming silver robes for you
And bats, that with a kiss turn prince for you

This is the place where we used to live
I paid for it with love and blood
And these are the boxes that she kept on the shelf
Filled with her poetry and stuff

Lou Reed,"They say he didn't have an enemy
His was a greatness to behold
He was the last surviving progeny
The last one on this side of the world
He measured half a mile from tip to tail
silver and black with powerful fins
They say he could split a mountain in two
That's how we got the Grand Canyon
Some say they saw him at the Great Lakes
Some say they saw him off the coast of Florida
My mother said she saw him in Chinatown
but you can't always trust your mother.
Off the Carolinas the sun shines brightly in the day
The lighthouse glows ghostly there are night
The chief of a local tribe had killed a racist mayor's son
and he'd been on death row since 1958
The mayor's kid was a rowdy pig
spit on Indians and lots worse
The old chief buried a hatchet in his head
life compared to death for him seemed worse
The tribal brothers gathered in the lighthouse to sing
and tried to conjure up a storm or rain
The harbor parted and the great whale sprang full up
and caused a huge tidal wave
The wave crushed the jail and freed the chief
The tribe let out a roar
The whites were drowned
the browns and reds set free
but sadly one thing more
Some local yokel member of the NRA
kept a bazooka in his living room
and thinking he had the chief in his sights
blew the whale's brains out with a lead harpoon
Well Americans don't care for much of anything
land and water the least
And animal life is low on the totem pole
with human life not worth much more than infected yeast
Americans don't care too much for beauty
They'll shit in a river, dump battery acid in a stream
They'll watch dead rats wash up on the beach
and complain if they can't swim
They say things are done for the majority
Don't believe half of what you see
and none of what you hear
It's a lot like what my painter friend Donald said to me
""Stick a fork in their ass and turn them over, they're done""

his father beats him 'cause he's too tired to beg

He's got 9 brothers and sisters
they're brought up on their knees
it's hard to run when a coat hanger beats you on the thighs
Pedro dreams of being older and killing the old man
but that's a slim chance he's going to the boulevard

He's going to end up, on the dirty boulevard
he's going out, to the dirty boulevard
He's going down, to the dirty boulevard

you can believe it man it's true
somewhere a landlord's laughing till he wets his pants

they dream of dealing on the dirty boulevard

he's selling plastic roses for a buck
The traffic's backed up to 39th street
the TV whores are calling the cops out for a suck

And back at the Wilshire, Pedro sits there dreaming
he's found a book on magic in a garbage can
He looks at the pictures and stares at the cracked ceiling
""At the count of 3"" he says, ""I hope I can disappear""

life wouldn't rise through him again

human nature splits the soul
Fully human, fully divine and divided

attract
From the front, the side, the back
the mind itself attacks

I know the feeling, I know it from before
Descartes through Hegel belief is never sure

Outside the city shrieking screaming whispering

He can't even remember his name
How can he do what needs to be done
When he's a follower not a leader
The sickness of the mother runs on through the girl
Leaving her small and helpless
Liquor flies through her brain with the force of a gun
Leaving her running in circles
How she can tell a good act from the bad
When she's flat on her back in her room
How can she do what needs to be done
When she's a coward and a bleeder
The man if he marries his child
And have endless excuses
The woman sadly will do much the same

Better than the childhood they suffered

and once was a member of the Klan
wouldn't you call me on it

There's no Three bananas or Brandy Alexander

And the girls for pay dates are giving cut rates
or else doing it for free

And I don't want to hear it anymore

I got to get my head above my knees

Lou Reed,"Sam was lyin' in the jungle
agent orange spread across the sky like marmalade
Hendrix played on some foreign jukebox
they were praying to be saved
Those gooks were fierce and fearless
That's the price you pay when you invade
Xmas in February
Sam lost his arm in some border town
his fingers are mixed with someone's crop
If he didn't have that opium to smoke
the pain would never ever stop
Half his friends are stuffed into black body bags
with their names printed at the top
Xmas in February
Sammy was a short order cook in a 
short order black and blue collar town
Everybody worked the steel mill but
the steel mill got closed down
He thought if he joined the Army
he'd have a future that was sound
Like no Xmas in February
Sam's staring at the Vietnam Wall
It's been a while now that he's home
His wife and kid have left, he's unemployed
He's a reminder of the war that wasn't won
He's the guy on the street with the sign that reads
""Please help send this Vet home""
But he is home
And there's no Xmas in February
No matter how much he saves

Lou Reed,"Standin' on a corner,
Suitcase in my hand.
Jack's in his car, says to Jane, who's in her vest,
Me, babe, I'm in a rock n' roll band.
Ridin' in a Stutz Bearcat, Jim,
Those were different times.
And the poets studied rows of verse, 
And all the ladies rolled their eyes

Sweet Jane, Sweet Jane, Sweet Jane

Now, Jack, he is a banker, 
And Jane, she is a clerk.
And the both of them are saving up their money...
Then they come home from work.
Sittin' by the fire...
Radio just played a little classical music for you kids,
The march of the wooden soldiers
And you can hear Jack say

Sweet Jane, Sweet Jane, Sweet Jane

Some people like to go out dancing
And other people, (like us) they gotta work
And there's always some evil mothers
They'll tell you life is full of dirt.
And the women never really faint, 
And the villans always blink their eyes.
And the children are the only ones who blush.
'Cause life is just to die.
But, anyone who has a heart
Wouldn't want to turn around and break it
And anyone who ever played the part
He wouldn't want to turn around and fake it

Lou Reed,"It was a very cold clear fall night
I had a terrible dream
Billy Name and Brigid were playing under my stair case
on the second floor about two o'clock in the morning

I woke up
because Amos and Archie had started barking
That made me very angry
because I wasn't feeling well and I told them
I was very cross the real me
that they just better remember
what happened to Sam the bad cat
that was left at home and got sick and went pussy heaven

It was a very cold clear fall night
Some snowflakes were falling
Gee, it was so beautiful
and so I went to get my camera to take some pictures
And then I was taking the pictures
but the exposure thing wasn't right
and I was going to call Fred or Gerry
to find out how to get set it
I was too late
and then I remembered they were still probably at dinner
and anyway
I felt really bad and didn't want to talk to anybody
but the snowflakes were so beautiful and real looking
and I really wanted to hold them
And that's when I heard the voices
from down the hall near the stairs
So I got a flashlight
and I was scared and I went out into the hallway
There's been all kinds of troubles
lately in the neighborhood
and someone's got to bring home the bacon and anyway
there were Brigid and Billy playing

And under the stair case
was a little meadow sort of like the park at 23rd street
where all the young kids go and play frisbee
Gee, that must be fun
maybe we should do an article on that in the magazine
but they'll just tell me I'm stupid and it won't sell
but I'll just hold my ground this time, I mean
it's my magazine, isn't it?

So I was thinking that as the snowflakes fell
and I heard those voices having so much fun
Gee, it would be so great to have some fun
So I called Billy
but either he didn't hear me or he didn't want to answer
which was so strange
because
even if I don't like reunions I've always loved Billy
I'm so glad he's working
I mean it's different than Ondine
He keeps touring with those movies
and he doesn't even pay us and the film
I mean the film's just going to disintegrate and then what
I mean he's so normal off of drugs
I just don't get it

And then I saw John Cale
he's been looking really great
He's been coming by the office to exercise with me
Ronnie said I have a muscle
but he's been really mean since he went to AA
I mean what does it mean
when you give up drinking and then you're still so mean
He says I'm being lazy but I'm not
I'm just can't find any ideas
I mean I'm just not
let's face it
going to get any ideas up at the office

And seeing John made me think of the Velvets
and I had been thinking about them
when I was on St. Marks Place
going to that new gallery those sweet new kids have opened
but the thought I was old
and then I saw the old DOM
the old club where we did our first shows
It was so great
And I don't understand about that Velvet's first album
I mean I did the cover
I was the producer
and I always see it repackaged
and I've never gotten a penny from it
How could that be
I should call Henry
but it was good seeing John
I did a cover for him
but I did in black and white and he change it to color
It would have been worth more if he'd left it my way
but you can never tell any body anything I've leaned that

I tried calling again to Billy and John
they wouldn't recognize me it was like I wasn't there
Why won't they let me in

And then I saw Lou
I'm so mad at him
Lou Reed got married and didn't invite me
I mean is it because he thought I'd bring too many people
I don't get it
could have at least called
I mean he's doing so great
Why doesn't he call me?
I saw him at the MTV show
and he was one row away and he didn't even say hello
I don't get it
You know I hate Lou
I really do
He won't even hire us for his videos
And I was proud of him

I was so scared today
There was blood leaking thought my shirt
from those old scars from being shot
And the corset I wear to keep my insides in was hurting
And I did three sets of fifteen pushups
and four sets of ten setups
But then my insides hurt
and I saw drops of blood on my shirt and I remember
the doctors saying I was dead
And then later they had to take blood out of my hand
'couse they ran out or veins
but then
all this thinking was making me an old grouch
and you can't do anything anyway so
if they wouldn't let me play with them in my own dream
I was just going to have to make another
and another
and another
Gee, wouldn't it be funny if I died in this dream
before I could make another one up

And nobody called

And nobody came

I always fall in love with someone who looks

Are always disappointed when they meet me

I wished I talked to you more when you were alive
I thought you were self-assured when you acted shy
Hello, it's me

I really miss you, I really miss your mind
I haven't heard ideas like that for such a long, long time
I loved to watch you draw and watch you paint
But when I saw you last, I turned away

When Billy Name was sick and locked up in his room
You asked me for some speed, I though it was for you
I'm sorry if I doubted your good heart

Your cow wallpaper and your floating silver pillows
I wish I paid more attention when they laughed at you

""Pop goes pop artist"", the headline said
""Is shooting a put-on, is Warhol really dead""
You get less time for stealing a car
I remember thinking as I heard my own record in a bar

They really hated you, now all that's changed
But I have some resentments that can never be unmade
You hit me where it hurt I didn't laugh

From a photo worth re-seeing

Multiply them with silk screening
See them with a different feeling

Some say images have no feeling, I think there's a deeper meaning
Mechanical precision or so it's seeming
Instigates a cooler feeling
I love multiplicity of screenings
Things born anew display new meanings
I think images are worth repeating and repeating and repeating

I'm no sphinx, no mystery enigma

It doesn't matter what I am thinking
It's the images that are worth repeating

If you think technique is meaning, you might find me very simple
You might think the images boring

He said decide what you want
Do you want to expand your parameters
Or play museums like some dilettante
I fired him on the spot, he got red and called me a rat
It was the worst word that he could think of
And I've never seen him like that

Work, he'd said it's just work
Andy said a lot of things, I stored them all away in my head

And other people, (like us) they gotta work
And there's always some evil mothers

It had something to say
When he fell down on his knees
After soaring through the air
With nothing to hold him there
It was really not so cute
To play without a parachute
As he stood upon the ledge
Looking out, he thought he saw a brook

And he hollered, look, there are the bells
And he sang out, here come the bells

See this here, this is where I chipped my tooth
Shot of vein in my neck and I coughed up a quaalude

A feeling that there's nowhere to turn
Yippies, hippies and upwardly mobile yuppies
Don't treat me like I'm some dumb lackey
'cause the murderer lives while the victims die
I'd much rather see it an eye for an eye
A heart for a heart, a brain for a brain
And if this all makes you feel a little insane
Kick up your heels, turn the music up loud
Pick up your guitar and look out at the crowd, and say, -
- ""don't mean to come on sanctimonious
But life's got me nervous and little pugnacious
Lugubrious so I give a salutation
And rock on out to beat really stupid
Ohh, poop, ah, doo and how do you do
Hip hop gonna bop till I drop.""

Lou Reed,"I was staring through a telescope at night
At a large light in the sky
Its spinning lights reminded me of you
A star spinning in orbit
Lighting up the sky
Or maybe it was not a star at all

I was standing by the hudson river's edge at night
Looking out across the Jersey shore
At a neon light spelling out some cola's name
And I thought your name should be dancing
Beamed from satellites
Larger than any billboard in Time's Square

I'm on the roof, it's 5 a.m.
I guess I couldn't sleep
And I see this spinning light that I saw last week
Maybe I should wake you up
But by then it might be gone
You never know what you see when if you look up in the sky

I ran outside down a darkened street
Listening to my boot heels click
My leather jacket squeaked I needed a cigarette
When I turned the corner
My spinning light was in the street
They were filming a commercial on T.V.

Hurricanes rip the sky forever

Harry thought of the range of possibilities

He said he only deals in cash or sells tickets to a plane crash
He's not somebody that you play around with much
Miss Delilah is his, a Philistine is what she is
She'll do wondrous works with your fate
Feed you coconut bread, spice buns in your bed
If you don't mind sleepin' with your head face down in a grave.

Well, there ain't no goin' back when your foot of pride come down
Ain't no goin' back

Well they'll choose a man for you to meet tonight
You'll play the fool and learn how to walk through doors
How to enter into the gates of paradise
No, how to carry a burden too heavy to be yours
Yeah, from the stage they'll be tryin' to get water outta rocks
A whore will pass the hat, collect a hundred grand and say thanks
They like to take all this money from sin, build big universities to study in
Sing ""Amazing Grace"" all the way to the Swiss banks

Well, there ain't no goin' back when your foot of pride come down
Ain't no goin' back

They got some beautiful people out there, man
They can be a terror to your mind and show you how to hold your tongue
They got mystery written all over their forehead
They kill babies in the crib and say only the good die young
They don't believe in mercy
Judgment on them is something that you'll never see
They can exalt you up or bring you down main route
Turn you into anything that they want you to be

Well, there ain't no goin' back when your foot of pride come down
Ain't no goin' back

Yes, I guess I loved him too
I can still see him in my mind climbin' that hill
Did he make it to the top, well he probably did and dropped
Struck down by the strength of the will
Ain't nothin' left here partner, just the dust of a plague that has left this whole town afraid
From now on, this'll be where you're from
Let the dead bury the dead. Your time will come
Let hot iron blow as he raised the shade

Well, there ain't no goin' back when your foot of pride come down
Ain't no goin' back",Foot of Pride,1993
Lou Reed,"Mary grows a child without the help of a man
Joseph get upset because he doesn't understand
Angel comes to Joseph in a powerful dream
Says ""God did this and you're part of his scheme""
Joseph comes to Mary with his hat in his hand
Says ""forgive me I thought you'd been with some other man""
She says ""what if I had been - but I wasn't anyway and guess what
I felt the baby kick today""

Driving the ripples on forever
Redemption rips through the surface of time
In the cry of a tiny babe


The child is born in the fullness of time
Three wise astrologers take note of the signs
Come to pay their respects to the fragile little king
Get pretty close to wrecking everything
'Cause the governing body of the whole land
Is that of Herod, a paranoid man
Who when he hears there's a baby born King of the Jews
Sends death squads to kill all male children under two
But that same bright angel warns the parents in a dream
And they head out for the border and get away clean


Like a stone on the surface of a still river
Driving the ripples on forever
Redemption rips through the surface of time
In the cry of a tiny babe


There are others who know about this miracle birth
The humblest of people catch a glimpse of their worth
For it isn't to the palace that the Christ child comes
But to shepherds and street people, hookers and bums
And the message is clear if you've got ears to hear
That forgiveness is given for your guilt and your fear
It's a Christmas gift you don't have to buy
There's a future shining in a baby's eyes


Like a stone on the surface of a still river
Driving the ripples on forever
Redemption rips through the surface of time
In the cry of a tiny babe

Chase the costumes she shall wear
Ermine furs adorn imperious

A thousand dreams that would awake me
Different colors made of tears

Kiss the boot of shiny, shiny leather
Shiny leather in the dark
Tongue of thongs, the belt that does await you

Taste the whip, in love not given lightly

I was speakin' to Bill who was given to pills and small racing cars
He had given them up since his last crack-up had carried him too far

She's a wild child, oh, and nobody can get to her

But life in the theater, is certainly fraught
With many spills and chills
But she'd come down after some wine
Which is what happens most of the time
Then we sat and both spoke in rhymes
Till we spoke of Loraine, ah, always back to Lorraine

I was talking to Ed who'd been reported dead by mutual friends
He thought it was funny that I had no money to spend on him
So we both shared a piece of sweet cheese
And sang of our lives and our dreams
And how things can come apart at the seams
And we talk of Lorraine, always back to Lorraine

And all the ladies rolled their eyes

Jack, he is a banker,
Jane, she is a clerk.
And the both of them are saving up their money

Radio just played a little classical music for you kids,
The march of the wooden soldiers
And you can hear Jack say

Sweet Jane, sweet Jane, sweet Jane

Some people like to go out dancing
And other people, (like us) they gotta work
And there's always some evil mothers
They'll tell you that life is just made out of dirt.
And the women never really faint,
Oh the villains always blink their eyes.
And the children are the only ones who blush.
And life is just to die.

Wouldn't want to turn around and break it
And anyone who ever played the part
He wouldn't want to turn around and fake it

Lou Reed,"You're an adventurer
You sail across the oceans
You climb the Himalayas
Seeking truth and beauty as a natural state
You're a queen reborn
Worshiped from above, afar
Some see you as an elixir
An elemental natural, seeking perfect grace
In a catacomb
Or cave of endless drawings
Prehistoric or religious
Your accomplishments prodigious
Seeking out the perfect tone
Your language so clear
Your voice perfectly turning
As in the city, I sit yearning
Blowing rings of smoke from thin cigars
Or driving fast in foreign cars
To capture your remains
You're an adventurer
A turban wet, wrapped 'round your head
On the mountainside, they predict your death
Oh, how you fooled them all
But subjects are a poor excuse
When what you really want's a muse
An inspirating knowledge of what comes before
Speeds of light
The momentary flicker of a candle in its wicker basket
Smoking wax - facts!
Did you find that superior knowledge that eluded you in college?
Did you find that super vortex that could cause your cerebral cortex
To lose its grip?
You're an adventurer
You were out looking for meaning
While the rest of us were steaming in an inspirating urban pit
An adventurer
You enter as I'm dreaming
I wish I'd never wake up
Differentiating, scheming from my one true love
You're an adventurer
You love the angles and the cherries
The height and width of levies
The natural bridge and tunnels of the human race
You're an adventurer
Nothing seems to scare you, and if it does, it won't dissuade you
You just will not think about it
You dismiss it and defocus
You redefine the locus of your time in space - race!
As you move further from me, and though I understand the thinking
And have often done the sane thing, I find parts of me gone
You're an adventurer
And though I'll surely miss you
And of course I'll survive without you and maybe good will come of that
But at this point I anticipate some grieving
And although I know your leaving
Is a necessary adjunct to what we both do

Splitting up the once was
Splitting up the essence

Heading for the finish line

Down in the train yard out by the stockyard
Butchers with aprons hack meat in the snow
Blood has the brothers pulsing with envy
Heading for the finish line

Just like these feelings I have for you
And nothing's forever not even five minutes
When you're headed for the finish line

Down in the depot out by the meat rack
Down by the tunnels surrounding the jail
Prisoners are marching in squares and in circles
They're heading for the finish line

They're lining up for Noah's Ark
They're stabbing each other in the dark
Saluting a flag made of some rich guy's socks
Heading for the finish line

Close to the line the ice is cracking
Two rented feelings sitting in the stands
Two mothers, two fathers and both of them are paid for
All of a sudden it comes back to me

Just up ahead is the finish line
Two rented referees and two checkered rags
Out of the corner of my eye comes a
Dark horse with black wings
Headed for the finish line

So different, and so new
Was like any other
Until I met you
And then it happened
You took me by surprise
I knew that you felt it too
I could see it by the look in your eyes
Sweeter than wine
Softer than a summer's night
Everything I want, I have
Whenever I hold you tight

While your lips are close to mine
Will last forever
Forever, 'til the end of time
So why won't you dance with me

Lou Reed,"A son who is cursed with a harridan mother
Or a weak simpering father at best
Is raised to play out the timeless classical motives
Of filial love and incest

How does he talk to her
What does he say for an opening line
What does he say if he's shy

With your classically neurotic style
How do you deal with your vague self-comprehension's
What do you do when you lie

In the way I handled things

With a heart that says: ""Rollo""

So when push comes to shove, get the Harley revved up
The moon can eclipse even the sun

Lou Reed,"Pedro lives out of the Wilshire Hotel
he looks out a window without glass
The walls are made of cardboard, newspapers on his feet
his father beats him 'cause he's too tired to beg

He's got 9 brothers and sisters
they're brought up on their knees
it's hard to run when a coat hanger beats you on the thighs
Pedro dreams of being older and killing the old man
but that's a slim chance he's going to the boulevard

He's going to end up, on the dirty boulevard
he's going out, to the dirty boulevard
He's going down, to the dirty boulevard

This room cost 2,000 dollars a month
you can believe it man it's true
somewhere a landlord's laughing till he wets his pants
No one here dreams of being a doctor or a lawyer or anything
they dream of dealing on the dirty boulevard

Give me your hungry, your tired your poor I'll piss on 'em
that's what the Statue of Bigotry says
Your poor huddled masses, let's club 'em to death
and get it over with and just dump 'em on the boulevard

Get to end up, on the dirty boulevard
going out, to the dirty boulevard
He's going down, on the dirty boulevard
going out

Outside it's a bright night
there's an opera at Lincoln Center
movie stars arrive by limousine
The klieg lights shoot up over the skyline of Manhattan
but the lights are out on the Mean Streets

A small kid stands by the Lincoln Tunnel
he's selling plastic roses for a buck
The traffic's backed up to 39th street
the TV whores are calling the cops out for a suck

And back at the Wilshire, Pedro sits there dreaming
he's found a book on magic in a garbage can
He looks at the pictures and stares at the cracked ceiling
""At the count of 3"" he says, ""I hope I can disappear""

And fly fly away, from this dirty boulevard
I want to fly, from dirty boulevard
I want to fly, from dirty boulevard
I want to fly-fly-fly-fly, from dirty boulevard

I want to fly away
I want to fly
Fly, fly away
I want to fly

Lou Reed,"I'll be your mirror
Reflect what you are, in case you don't know
I'll be the wind, the rain and the sunset
The light on your door to show that you're home

When you think the night has seen your mind
That inside you're twisted and unkind
Let me stand to show that you are blind
Please put down your hands
'Cause I see you

I find it hard to believe you don't know
The beauty that you are
But if you don't let me be your eyes
A hand in your darkness, so you won't be afraid

Lou Reed,"She's out of her mind
like the wind in the storm
Oh, like the ocean in the dawn
as it disappears, with the riptide

She's out of her mind
she's pulled away by the moon
She's ripped from her sleep
as the cold luna sweep gains control

Ooohhh, what you gonna do with your emotions
Ah, ones you barely recognize
In your sleep I heard your screaming, ooohhh
""This is not voluntary! This is not voluntary!
If this is life I'd rather die!""

In the riptide, in the riptide

She's out of her mind, riptide
like a muscle that swells
You know when you trip
whether you're well or sick, your body aches

She's out with the tide
gone to a prisoner's dance
Where a monkey's her date
eating limbs off a plate with a spoon

Ooohhh, what you gonna do with your emotions
said the seagull to the loon
What you gonna do with your emotions

She said ""Please wake me up""
She said ""Don't touch me now""
She said ""I wish I was dead""

With the riptide

She's out of her mind
riptide, you always win
It happens over and over again
riptide

She's out of her mind
like a hurricane's rain
She does not stand a chance
at this luna dance, riptide

I was thinking of Van Gogh's last painting
the wheatfields and the crows
Is that perhaps what you've been feeling
When you see the ground
as you fall from the shy
As the floors disappears from beneath your feet riptide

She's going out of her mind
out with the tide
out of her mind
riptide

She's going out of her mind
with the riptide
She's going out of her mind

Lou Reed,"I wish I had a talking book
That told me how to act and look
A talking book that contained keys
To past and present memories
A talking book that said your name
So if you were gone, you'd still remain
More than a picture on a shelf
In imagination I could touch
A talking, talking book

I wish I had a talking book
Filled with buttons you could push
Containing looks and sights, your touch
Your feel, your breath, your sounds, your sighs
How much I'd bluster to ask it why
One must live and one must die

I wish I had a talking book
By my side so I could look
And touch and feel and dream, a look
Much bigger than a talking book
A taste of loving future and past
Is that so much to really ask

In this one moment's time and space
Can our love really be replaced
By a talking book
Can our love really be replaced
By a talking book
