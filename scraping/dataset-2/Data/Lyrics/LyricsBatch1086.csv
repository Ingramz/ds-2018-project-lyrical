Terror Squad,"Lock that fuckin door, yo
Lock all that shit

[ verse 1: armageaddon ]
Y'all muthafuckas can't hold me back
Holdin gats drunk off of cognac
Laughin at life and how my goal be makin the hoes react
Ridin in cars, out to get me eight full of shinin stars
Overwhelmin, any average rapper will find it hard
To deal with the way my squad puts metal to flesh
We rebels to death, leakin body heat, decimals less
My shotie completes the measure of death
I'm hittin your chest
I'm only 1100 double threat, beware of the rest
Terror squad's everywhere like weed smoke
If my pump shotie was sweet chokes
I'd twist the whole place with three strokes
Dump this ? ? ? sawed-off barrel
I send your soul to follow the blast
And see how far the noise will travel
Big eaddie's name never lost his value
I told you before on joe's album
We been illin since the holy pharaohs
Run out of heat, I still burst you with bangers
Believe, me and violence connect and we have our own personal language

[ chorus ]
Money - gimme dat
Power - g-gimme dat
Guns - gimme dat
Freedom - g-gimme dat
Pussy - gimme dat
Drugs - g-gimme dat
( *shot* ) gimme dat
Respect, better gimme dat (2x)

[ verse 2: armageaddon ]
Hey yo, your era's over
And your peoples lack the charm or persona
The sound of my chrome be bangin from home to arizona
My gun be clickin like your chain on my neck, claim my respect
Give me a pound or feel the pain in your chest
I only bang with t.s.
That's some squad that God returned to the surface
Bustin scary-ass burners that burst through your epidermes
Niggas respect the verses, my shit is heat, so I'ma set the furnace
To burn whoever's yearnin to hurt this
Nigga, tell me I ain't bringin the pain
If I ain't leave in a train
I'm probably fleein from puttin 3 in your brain
See what I'm sayin, it's all about this
Guns, murder and chips
And I gathered all in the palm of my fist
This is who armageaddon is
Raw to the brain, I'm sort of insane
But yet in never fall in the game
It's not enough, I need to fatten my stacks
More guns - g-g-gimme dat
More power and respect - gimme dat

[ chorus ] (4x)

Yo
See what I'm sayin?
Ain't no stoppin me
This was god's plan
This is what I am
This is who armageaddon is
In every sense of the word
Yo
Year 2000's around
And I'm still breathin life through my nostrils, bitch
I ain't goin nowhere
I'ma remain in your faces
Until my demise is televised
I told y'all niggas
Where my terrorists at?
Where all my terrorists at?
Throw your guns up in the air
More money!
More power!
More respect!
Take this muthafucka over
Fight for your muthafuckin freedom!
Bitch-ass niggas
Yeah, nigga
That's my life
",Gimme Dat,1999
Terror Squad,"[Big Punisher]
Don't even move a muscle
Clap at ya feet, blast ya boot buckle
Cowboy style, dance bitch, do the hustle
Let me see you sweat, follow the leader through the streets of death

Piece the bits together till you come up wit at least a brick
Then we can flip that, sip Henny and kick back
Chit-chat real quick, how we gon' split that
I suggest that we bubble it all

Cop a bundle of raw, start small, see if we can double the score
I stumble across my share of obtsacles
Staring death dead in the opticals
'Cause I'm never scared of the impossible

Ask the rasta dudes if our gonga ain't the tightest
Ask the pasta dudes if our china ain't the whitest
And none of my prostitutes vaginas got the virus
If you see one in the hospital you could bet it was violence

That's the science, my alliance is Terror Squad
If there's a god, show me sign so I can share my scars

[Chorus]
We in for life, ready to fight, my twins is hype
Better get it right or get deaded on sight
So take flight, make one mistake and pay twice
'cause shit is trife, lose your life just tryin to break night
We in for life, under the lights but I'm outta sight
When I write sometimes I wonder if it's outta spite
I like livin on the edge, sippin strippers at the wedge
Sharin spritsers, gettin head, it's the life we live

[Triple Seis]
Play the corners at night, away from the fortunate lifes
For the gunplay, thugs auction the heist
Slugs put you in a coffin for life
It's bug how they put you on ice

For the love, the money ain't right
Haters'll grudge, pay you like a mummy at night
Stiff as a dick, told you when to quit from this shit
Got hit, 'cause you was quick to split loot wit ya bitch

Get a coupe and a six, but never troop in the mix
It seems foul, ? niggas while the cream pile
Didn't give a fuck, talkin tough ""Look at me now""
Shockin the world, should've been on top of your girl

She gon' do you in, turn around and rock your world
For petty dough, niggas on the streets already know
You about to go, movin on your block just to stop the flow
We about to blow, step up in rank
Step off the bank, niggas done fucked up to think

[Chorus] 

[Prospect]
Ah-yo I hold the pain, like my body was numb wit novacaine
No one can fold the name, Terror Squad a soldier game
Already know the game, Prospect the quote of fame
Touch up a older dame, and confirm the motor train

My vocals will slow your brain
I'm comin' at you like a boa-crane
Even through the cold and rain, I penetrate through all weather
Eliminate who you call better
It's all ""shut up shut up"", I'll leave your car wet up

[Cuban Link]
Set it off, we all together, gettin cheddar livin better 
Sippin amarettos, whippin the Vette instead of a Jetta
Dead up, never let up bet up, we settle vendettas
Ghetto dwellers, why'all better duck when I let off the beretta

Hit em up, yet I'm the terror that America wants dead
A blunt head turnin punks red when I pump lead
I stomp a hole through your chest
Grab your soul, mold ya flesh
Hold ya breath 'cause your next stop is death

[Chorus]

[Fat Joe]
Yeah yeah, we in for mothafuckin like, ya heard me?
See you niggas creepin over there
Thinkin why'all niggas could cut corners, get around
Nigga this is the mothafuckin T-Squaders

We will BUY YOU mothafuckas, simple as that
So-called mothafuckin rap killas, rap pimps
Niggas is BITCHES to me, simple as that

I murder men wit the poisonous flow, my pen
Hurt 'em for they dough and they GM's wit Mac 10
No relaxin', straight action when it's on

Call up Pun and The Don, come up heavily armed
Niggas better be calm or I'ma set the alarm
And a hundred strong'll form in shape of a bomb
My squads'll forever bomb wit a war like Lebanon
And we hardcore till we dead and gone, so go ahead and mourn

Aiyo Seis, I'm pacin back and forth
Wit thoughts of bein' trapped up North
But after I come off wit it y'all can push em out the door
So, cock the four pound
(Four pound)

Lock the fort down

From New York to Georgetown

Knockin' off clowns that clap 'em off rounds

It's war now, so toss the nine 'cause I'ma floss and shine

Hilarious how we mute crews, and nigga this is true news
Dudes'll blow you outta ya two shoes

Who chose to front it? They don't really want it
Yo, I stay Philly blunted, prospect wit the nine milly gun it
I leave you dented by the way glock pop
Take a hot shot, push ya knot back like a drop top

Freeze like coke in the drop or ya float when I'm totin' the glock
I'm blast any feelings you catch from this to emotional stop
Host it on top, label the worst to the topic
Worshippin' violence, push you back

Like a cursor does the words by the silence
Hush, slow up before you blow ya clutch
Hold my forty four wit lust an' then I'll take your soul like a Holy touch
The tat on my arm's like the rhymes I write 'cause Armageaddon rivals life

Put one in your brain for fuckin' wit the creme of the crop
Sayin', I'm hot, while you playin', I'm blazin' the spot
Makin' you bop, makin' my way to the top

Breakin' the lock, takin' a shot at the title
Ready to rock at my rivals
Like Pac everything I drop is the Bible
Cop it on vinyl, there's just a little cursing
If you want ya head to burst
Play it in reverse, you'll hear the Devil's version

Hear the metal's burstin', there's a terror lurkin'
It's a certain, whoever searchin' to find God when my clips inserted
Words are blurted when we bust guns, you heard it
Left ya murdered

I know ya, was stunned by the verdict
I'm a free man, kill your free lance for only three grand
Makin' an examp for my other workers and cut off each hand
You greedy mothafuckas, I'll see you in Hell

Terror Squad,"[Keith Nut]
Holy Christ, I leave rappers' souls as cold as ice
I'm like a poltergeist when I strike, turnin men to mice
Breakin the law, city urban tower without a four
Bringin the raw homicidal lyrics that clear the floor

Niggas thought they seen the last of this
Project poet assassinist
Whose status is never havin to clappin clips
Have to black-on-black some shit, attractive accentes

Life luxury ??? crackin it
Runnin with drugs and dealers
Thugs and killers, slugs in villas
Black gorillas and million dollar billers

Microphone nemesis, murder affiliate
Lyricists get dissed, dismissed, thrown off the premises
Poetically mugged, pedigree's incredibly
Movin steadily, thoroughly

Clippin you somethin terribly
Keith Nut, one of the last to go
One of the last to flow
One of the last niggas to blow

[Chorus]
Now who them niggas that be breakin rules? (T Squad)
Now who them niggas that be payin dues? (Keith Nut)
Now who them niggas that be roamin the town
Blowin a pound, since day one holdin it down
Now who them niggas that be breakin rules? (T Squad)
Now who them niggas that be payin dues? ('Geaddon)
Now who them niggas that be roamin the town
Blowin a pound, since day one holdin it down

[Armageaddon]
I'm here to reclaim my respect
Reppin the set that be bangin my chest
T.S., the God's medaillon, tombstone and begets
Alone and wet I blow my own Tec

Ever had beef with 'Geadd and hold no regrets
Then you was no threath
I go to Death blessed with God's heed
And drop a gem on your melon so hard it make you knock-knee

And my plot's greed, my theme's murder
My climax is when the heat from the burner
Blast me the wings to go further
Nigga, the century's turnin and I went out of patience

You think you hard, that .44 blast, it clouds your concentration
Again, think about it, before my gun hollers
And kill everything around em even if you bought the album
Enforce the power with guns, dollars and politics

Start a baby apocalypse when my .44 ??? spit
Pops in and out your skin, breakin through sound and wind
Piercin the meat and [edited] back out again

[Chorus]

[Keith Nut]
Next nigga treason's gonna meet the demons
Left for his mama grievin
When I squeeze the Desert Eag' and cease his breathin
Wreck your set, make the average rapper wish for death

Clap him at the chest, bless him with the Wesson, hope you got your vest
Keith's the last to test, the last to gasp for breath
Send you on a crash course to death when I blast the Tec
Terror faculty known for fillin cavities gradually
Stackin g's, sippin D'Acquerys, livin happily rapidly

[Armageaddon]
I don't give a fuck, all I could do with my life was pitch my luck
Act sheist when they look at us, that's the price when you cruise a truck
And I'd advise you to analyze us, find out who you can trust
Rival me plus memorize the eyes of the dudes you bust

You never know when it's over, rise up out of the tomb and dust
The movin slug was smoothly touched before you recognized who he was
And I recognize ??? for doin the shit that stupid does
My cats gon' shoot them slug, send them things right through yo mug

Terror Squad,"Never jump up in-a mi face 'cause I gun
Never judge a book by di cover, dat's wrong
Dis is Fat Joe alongside di Banton
Hey, what about Pun?
Rudeboy, salute with your gun
Terror Squad leader, come down

When I was young I blazed the corner with a vengeance
Crack king descendant, 14 years old facin' a sentence
Me and Tone Soul still co-defendants
Know your legends, Fat Joe, Soul blowin' up sessions

Split dough with detectives to get my flow in protection
Through the ice on my gold you see your own reflection
Can't tell me shit about murder and movin' weight
I got niggas that's off the scale that'll bust through you and your mate

It's proven today, Armageddon's comin' sooner than late
We rappers that really blast, I know Cuban relates
50 niggas of terror, rockin' 560 leathers
Some of us are dyin' to gain but the name lives forever

Marked on my flesh to make my thoughts manifest
When I spark, no man's heart could withstand through the test
So apply the pressure like I used to do but Crack never left
I traded in my double breasted for a Mac and a vest, what the fuck?

Never jump up in-a mi face, I gun
Never judge a book by di cover, dat's wrong
Dis is Fat Joe alongside di Banton
Hey, what about Pun?
Rudeboy, salute with your gun

Tonight is a whole lot of fun, tell them, icin' this
From the heart of Kingston to the ice of Alaska
Buffalo Soldier, hardcore rasta, I am di original, fuck di impostor
Determined to make it with or without ya

No borders, no boundaries
I've got to take care of my enemies
Don't you oppress, elevate stress
Disrespect [Incomprehensible] wreckless

Artillery strapped over my chest
Bullet a-penetrate from right out to left
Skip and dive, duck like The Matrix
From the day I've been born I have been a target

Get, get, whenever, whoever disrespect Buju Banton
Never, Lord, [Incomprehensible] clever
Wanted, make di front page of di [Incomprehensible]
Terror Squad crew, you're takin' over, over, over, over, hear dis

Never jump up in-a mi face 'cause I gun
Never judge a book by di cover, dat's wrong
Dis is Fat Joe alongside di Banton
Hey, what about Pun?
Rudeboy, salute with your gun

Little baby jacker, raised my little sister while you baby-sat
Why she livin' fat, she ain't got a baby back, ya heard?
'Cause where we at, it's either live or die
I seen a nigga sky high from blye 'cause he thought the shit was fly

I let you ride if you bustin', I let you die if you bluffin'
'Cause to die is the whole price of nothin'

You fuckin' with all brothers and Bronx bombers
Who want dramas, word to my dead and gone mama
Let me find the next muthafucka
Disrespect Fat Joe, the Don Carta
And I'ma have to jig a nigga like Shawn Carter

What's wrong, partner?
Punisher peel your banana, see you manana
Leave your mama covered with a white [incomprehensible]
That's right, I'ma be there with my guns

Blowin' the spot, I ain't got no hair on my tongues
'Cause where I'm from, we don't only talk the talk
We walk the walk, be-X, baby, New York, New York

Never jump up in-a mi face, I gun
Never judge a book by di cover, dat's wrong
This a Fat Joe and Buju Banton
Tell them, what about Pun?

Never jump up in-a mi face, I gun

Terror Squad,"Yeah
Fuck ya want from me
See I love my thugs but I'm a terrorist nigga
And Imma terrorize ya ass till gone for miles pana
What, bitch ass nigga

I jeopardize this rap shit and blast ya ass to prove a point
I got thug nigguz that don't even rap callin' to do joints
Frontin' off the strength and you the weak link in the click
It's obvious you pussy I could see the pink in the clit
I seen the chip and my clip of my daily desert eagle
Forty four metal with heat'll, open ya belly like it's legal
Push you back a few feet, send you sailin' like a seagull
When we clash in the street, why was you bailin' if you evil
(You ain't evil)

Talkin' 'bout somebody tryin' to playa hate you
Actually I like you but fuck wit my squad the German A.K.'ll hit you
Ever seen what them things could do to
Cut your legs, remove your from your hip down to ya tims
I'm like the limit on ya life, the demon on ya light
That figure in the dark that takes ya heart in the mid of night
This ain't a joke 'cause ain't nuttin' comical how my laser scope
Aim at ya dome could erase the features off ya facial bones

Fuck the battlin', it's World War four, I mean the red form
No need to crowd, the name is aroused up in the dead zone
New World Order, I only flow wit the real horror
Chrome C4 to ya door and Pearl Harbor
We can bring it back, gats on the holsters of mini macs
Gats on the holsters strapped to the shoulders of maniacs
Where we at the projects, why don't you get the closet
Ahh, shit killa clacks, could've brought back ya prostate

Buyacka got bullets big enough to move ya car
Land cruisers 18 wheelers we do it tied
Just let it happen, I prefer violence instead of rappin'
Fuckin' wit this Latin assassin, better get ya head examined
My shit be slammin' like Onyx and Wrestle Mania
You really want it, you philly blounted in Pennsylvania

Yo, now who the fuck wanna battle this
You garbage pail rappers would get ya cabbage split
Got a habit of brandin' ammitur nigguz like cattle hips
So watch ya lips 'cause what you fuckin' is hazardous
Shut up and catch a clip, I roll wit more dogz than St. Lazorous
What happened is ya raps ain't accurate, you claim you packin' it
But when the action hits you rather switch into a faggot bitch
I'm hardcore, it's not my fault ya softer than cardboard
Ya started to battle so I'mma turn into the God four

Switch to southpaw like De La Hoya golden boy
I put it on you polaroid finish, left you as red as Sonya
I been a soulja all my life, fought for stripes all most saw the light
Talk to Christ, he told me that my songs so nice
And for the right price I might just body you
Chop ya ass into particles and read about you in newspaper articles
I'm sick and tired talkin' shit, got beef wit me then so be it
I'll rush you like the Soviet Union and leave you soakin' wet

Make way for the ghetto roar, these days I set it off
Y'all hardcore, that's why I batter you all
Shatter they jaw, batter the core to make a fatter than yours

Terror Squad to my death, tombstone on my chest
With the chrome in the vest, alone or with T.S.
I'ma rep it, I'm a Dominican, now you accept it
It's like you seen death and chose the Lord as the shepherd

You skeptical, niggas on the block ain't respectin' you
Checkin' you, ain't gonna stop when they deckin' you
Who gon' dock you? I'm comin' at you like a tackle
To leave a personal scar in your chest like a tattoo

Seis'll clap you, put your dick in the dirt
Click at a herb when I spit a clip and rip through your shirt
I'm the worst of the beast, put my work on the streets
Do the work with the heat, don't make me burst through your meat

Trust that it's real and he'll be at my side at the end

Punish niggas from the heart, rip a niga from the sparks
Of the glizze, leave a nigga clapped on 'Rap City'
I'm strapped with the Mac Milli, you wack as ass Gilly

It ain't hard to scrap, my squad's the vanguard of rap
Love to guard your back in the biz, the triz in the back
Flamboyant, never givin' a slack, I jam joints when I live on a track
Ran point when they gave me the Mac

I'm on fat, never lack the realness, I sing that B.J. killer ill shit
And still rock a nigga, I'm out to be real rich
You feel this, shaper than a tooth pain, double-deuce pain
My verse take aim, blow your fame with a burst of flames

Ain't nothin' changed, I die in this game
Take the stand and the blame for my man
I carry the name revenge
Terror Squad in begets carved on my chain

Trust that it's real and he'll be at my side at the end

It's hard to explain how my squad can harbor the strain
of being the largest name in rap, since the almighty Kane
Acknowledge the fame, my call was to reign the streets
from Harlem to Queens, back to the Bronx who fathered the dream
Started this thing called rap, where I reign supreme, my team
Regardless of that, I've seen things as far as the crack
that'll make the hardest largest artist heart just collapse
I'm part of all that that's why it's so hard to go back
and start from scratch
I'm locked and I'm trapped, in a giant cage
Tryin to savor these few dyin' days
I have left, to the form of flesh, should I lie in my grave?
I'm tryin to persuade, my motto is try to be brave
and not give death the satisfaction of seein' me dyin' afraid
That why I rise from the grave singin' church songs like
I was Je-sus Christ pa-rum-pum-pum-pum

[Chorus: x2]
Whatcha gon' do when Pun comes?
Knockin' at ya front door
And he wants war, holy shit!
He ain't a rapper he'll kill you

'Til my last breath I'll have death before dishonor (c'mon)
And welcome drama (yeah) with open arms and a code of honor
My whole persona equals that of Gods
Definin' matters hard all before you even had a job
I'll stab and rob if I have to, fuck it I'll blast you
Tell the devil it was Pun, if he ask you
And let him know how we be deadin' 'em, show him my emblem
The tombstone, the throne, every millennium
A child is born that can preform at a level beyond
the expected four minute thirty second song
We reign supreme, my team be all up in your dream
with the ""kill anything"" grill, chillin' beside the guillotine
Executioner style, black suit and a smile
Who's next to get their neck hacked loose in the crowd
Move from the aisle, don't make me have to prove that I'm wild
Word to Cuban, my crew killers, y'all niggas shoot in the clouds
(Who's in the house?) Punisher straight from hell
Who's in the house (Terror Squad motherfucker we the real)
What the deal, now you know that's how we roll
Hard core like B.O., bring in the corns baby bro

Drink some liquor then pick a stripper that I can rip and tear, yeah
Come hear the sounds of a rookie fromt he boogie down
Used to be a shorty but guess who's givin nukkies now
So clown if you got the heart
Start some bullshit, it's your bid
A bullet through your skull from my full clip
I pull triggas givin niggas hell, like I'm sittin, 
Fake a move, punk, and i'll run you over like Walter Payton
Makin hits, my cliques, makin moola

True confessions, spark the see you' up,

Even in a suit n tie,
Cruisin though the 5 boroughs wit live thorough,
Niggas that like to smoke they Hydro in front of 5-0,
Yo Manolo shoot that piece of chit, Chichi get the yayo,
While I pay Frank a visit, but the bisquit to his cuello,
Ey yo, this fuckin blunt's got me buggin,
I be thuggin it out, like Noreaga playin,
You ain't sayin nothing, bustin rappers like adreneline,
Puttin venom in'em,
Put'em on stage, for minimum wage, to graves is where i send'em
Hem'em up like a party dress
Terror Squad is as hard as it gets
Rippin your heart out your chest
Spark the cess, chickenheads stressin the sex
want to jump up in the Lex, twin, when they see me wit the best
Twisted up the dutch, a little Tony's Touch
Let'em work the clutch while i lite the bliz up
On a highway wit this big fucka
Gettin high like Chris Tucker on Friday, hit it my way
Like Frank Sinatra, lite up at the opera
When the cops come show the prescription from the docta
I puff cause I got ta'
This stuff from the rasta's
Get enough love in the Bronx, from Italians wit all the pasta
John Blazin, keep the tree's blazin

""Remember Pun?""
Terror Squad 

I'll battle ya all, from the charts to ghetto stars
Face Triple Seis the God of War like Mars
That leave MC's smashed but my Squad, is odd
Y'all never seen relish, but always seem jealous
Of my extreme fellas, rockin' the ? sweaters
The ones who paid with they life
I rock for forty days and forty nights, and every verse is tight
Better than before; rough, rugged, and raw
Chainsaw metaphor that leave your brain sore
This ain't a game, I'll leave you maimed
Allow me to explain I thrive on the pain while robbin' your chain
Knahmean? Do him and the fiend, grab his wallet
Leave a trail-blazin like (Rasheed Wallace)
What's today's knowledge? Hold your heat like The Peacemaker
I walk the same streets the police take us
Livin' on the corner so won't speak it out my mouth
Respect and got the money son that's all that it's about
No doubt, silence of code, violence of mode
Under control, can tell my real niggas really roll
On the low tryin' to blow trees
And for no reas', we hit a nigga up for mo' cheese
Better relate and start to think, or be the missin' link
I got my Hustle on like Larry Flynt

We brave in the heart, playin' a part, amazingly smart
Razor sharp, futuristic raps, state of the art
Takin' New York cats past the stars
First it was Nasty Nas now watch me turn a Apple into Macintosh
Computer chip locomotion flow, la cosa nostra dough
Hold your toaster low, business never personal
Just some words to know, if you run the streets
Come in peace or leave in pieces
Even Jesus was killed by the polices
They crucified him now they inject us with juice to fry 'em
Depends on the state if death is my fate then cool I'm dyin'
If that's my destiny it's meant to be
Just remember to bury the motherfucker that bent me right next to me
Aight crew? (No doubt Pun!) Aight then, let's fight then
I'm hypened, comin' with the thunder and the lightning
Invitin' the comp, ice on the arm
Nights when I storm, snipin' your moms, right from the Bronx
Mic in the palm it's the ghetto God
I rip a nigga heart out his frame while I scream TERROR SQUAD
Be larger than life, my initials carved in my wife
She said she'd starve on a diet instead I'm a God in her eyes
The father of Christ, sure to be immortal
Guzzlin' beer bottles by the dozen with Devin that's mi hermano

You ain't understand how I push your wig back quick
A little quiet nigga wouldn't think I did that shit
I'm from where the guns love to introduce thyself
Reduce your health, little bulletproofs get felt
Who mind ready, for this big dog who hold a nine steady
I'm John Blazin' when you see the arms razin'
Shit crime heavy already, I keep it sharper than the long 'chette
Far from a snitch nigga who call Teddy
I click triggers how you more ready and switch bigger
Than more berry I'm a cherry you a strawberry
If you lost that mean I'm on top of the whip
You plottin' to flip, fuck around and get shot in the lip
You stop with the quick and never make another move
Even your mother lose, I hurt up your pops to pay your brother dues

""Big Pun ""
""Forever do you understand? FOREVER!""

Make way for krill, I don't play I spray for real
Blow your top with the glock, that's my favorite kill
Blaze your crib with like thirty shots
I'm already hot, but my last one is with some dirty cops
I play the streets with toast 'cause the thieves is close
Wanna keep your post then don't beef with Joe
Still niggas think I won't bring the heat out
That's like sayin' Puff ain't never beat up Steve Stoute
Truth first, Terror Squad, shoot first
War with me and you guaranteed to leave the earth
I'm, dressed to kill, my niggas rep for real
Joe Crack's back like I never had a deal
Hungry and shit, it don't get more lovely than this
Blow a hole through your ribs just for runnin' your lips
The street's a trip; either you deep or you sleep with the fish
I keep a fifth for them niggas that's seekin' to flip

We from the Bronx, New York, shit happens
Kids clappin', love to spark the place
Half the niggas in the squad got a scar on their face
It's a cold world and this is ice
Half a mill for the charm, nigga this is life
Got the Phantom in front of the building, Trinity Ave
Ten years been legit, they still figure me bad
As a young'n, was too much to cope with
Why you think mu'fuckers nicknamed me Cook Coke shit
Shoulda been called Armed Robbery
Extortion, or maybe Grand Larceny
I did it all, I put the pieces to the puzzle
Just as long, I knew me and my peoples was 'gon bubble
Came out the gate on some Flo-Jo shit
Fat nigga with the shotty with the logo kid!

Said my niggas don't dance we just pull up our pants
And do the rockaway, now lean back, lean back, lean back, lean back
I said my niggas don't dance we just pull up our pants
And do the rockaway, now lean back, lean back, lean back, lean back

R to the Ezzy, M to the Yzzy
My arms stay breezy, the Don stay flizzy
Got a date at 8, I'm in the 7-4-fizzive
And I just bought a bike so I can ride till I die
With a matchin' jacket, 'bout to cop me a mansion
My niggas in the club, but you know they not dancin
We gangsta, and gangstas don't dance with boogies
So never mind how we got in here with burners and hoodies
Listen we don't pay admission and the bouncers don't check us
And we, walk around the metal detectors
And there really ain't a need for a VIP section
In the middle of the dance floor reckless, check it
Said he, liked my necklace, started relaxin
Now that's what the fuck I call a chain reaction
See Money Ain't a Thing nigga, we still the same niggas

I said my niggas don't dance we just pull up our pants

Now we living better now, Coogi sweater now
And that G4 can fly through any weather now
See, niggas get tight when you worth some millions
This is why I sport the chinchilla to hurt they feelings
You can find Joe Crack at all type of shit
Out in Vegas front row to all the fights and shit
If 5-0 boy come, then they'd proudly squeal
Cause half these rappers they Blow like Derek Foreal
If you cross the line, damn right I'm 'gon hurt ya

This is classic shit right here, vintage shit
Go get ya tape decks ready
You know I had to bring 'em back
Terror era's the squad man
Yeah uh yo uh yo

Aye yo, I'm old school like Rick Ruler, sick jewels to big buddah
Lift dudes wit the six shooter luger
That means bring it back, NY king of that
The best tried a dead mind but just can't see to that
The 4th comin', don't look now there's more comin'
And we all stunners with lil' money but still hungry
True story, once threw a nigga from a two storey
Asked for my paper, said, ""There's nothin' he can do for me""
That's like takin' a steak out of a lion's mouth
Better yet that like takin' a plate outta Ryan's mouth

That'll never happen, over my dead body
Feds got me plastered on the wall like I'm the heir to Gotti
I swear to Mambo and Nore and all the left wreck
A nigga try front on his body he gettin' sent back
Don't resent crack, I'm just what you wanna be
Young, rich and famous bitches can't get enough of me
And they runnin' up on me usually in groups of them
But not just everyday but you could never be too used to them
I be abusin' them squeezin' fresh oranges
Breakfast in the mornin' get some strength and then it's on again

I just had to bring 'em back
Word you definitely know what I'm about
You know I had to bring 'em back yo
All my friends call me stout
I just had to bring 'em back
Flamboyant baby
You know I had to bring 'em back yo

When I cruise through the ghetto I drive slow
I'm quick to buck a duck and I don't give a fuck about five O
A hard core life I toast to ex-flaw
Therefore I live raw and went to war with the law
My only pencil was a mug shot slugs were thugs got pot
Get swellin' hops from sellin' tops to da drugs spot
G's was clocked fat knots was in the socks
And cops who tried to stop shop, got knocked when I popped the glock
Shit was ran right by me and my man Mike
'Cause I choose to use a gun don't mean that I can't fight

'Cause we put the guns down and go one round
With the hands but man I ain't the one, you'll get done clown
I can inverse my style, 'cause I'm versitile
Quick to burst a child I'm livin' worse than foul
I pack two techs in case ya crew flex
I wet up the set in a second yell who's next
To feel the wrath of a psychopath shoots it up like shaft
Turn ya staff into a blood bath to laugh
You'll get smashed like a deli snack, you softer than jelly Jack
I attack in black with a gat and a skully hat

I just had to bring 'em back
All my friends call me stout
You know I had to bring 'em back yo
Flamboyant baby
I just had to bring 'em back

You know I had to bring 'em back yo

No doubt I'm from the X and I seen it all
Shorties with dreams of playin' ball
For Seaton hall turnin' fiends a full
From me the word to Sacuon the same sad song
Is bein' sung, its like gimme a gun and I'm back on
Joey crack, Pun, TS, Bronx regulators
Stomp little niggaz to death for tryin' to imitate us
Y'all could never see us, be us, TS, kill the BS
'Cause Pun got more guns and funds than ideas
Un be us, I'm from the BX so I have to roll

Blastin' for crash ya door, smash ya hoe
Hack off ya skull, I'm stackin heads like totem poles
Blow a hole in ya colon throw you from here to Forden Road
Blow for blow, I toe to toe with the toughest
Bring the ruckus to the roughest motherfucker
It's nothin' but illustrous
My crews are cussin' to bustin' ass crushin' glass
In niggaz faces leavin' traces of red out this bloody bath
I want the cash off the jiddump, I cock and blast the piddump
At any piddunk tryin' to laugh at the briddonx

You ain't no kiddon for the terror squadron
You feel the fear of God when I steal a car
And flatten ya Pierre Cardin
I peirce ya noggin' if you startin' trouble
Spark the dot above you
And watch it blossom like a flower throughout the borough
No doubt I'm thorough with a parascope rifle extended rycle
Cycle that'll tear the whole Bible out
I'm sweatin' no idols a title's all I request
Best rappers know that pun and why the chaperones of death

Shit, I talkin' for everybody, walkin' united
The way I walk, it's a challenge just to balance on wires
My old connect put me on said he robbed the supplier
So I pieced him out with pity 'coz his ass was on fire

What goes around comes around holmes I ain't lyin'
That's why the scars on my face 'coz bad karma and violence
Just before a nigga wake I spend the night in silence
To give my nerves a little break before it's back to the malice
I'd like to dedicate this rhyme to old emotional scars
Some nights I meditate hopin' bring me closer to God
Tryin' to regulate my time between the Earth and the stars
Get my health back to determine when I curlin' them bars

Smokin' weed, eatin' curry chicken like the Robsters
After that go to city, Allen and get the lobsters

Now can I get a witness lemme show y'all my visions
Never had a job but still takin' all my business
No G.E.D only the promo what's my lyrics

To all my peoples that passed away, to all my, to all my
To to to, Free sanity and wings as they cast away

[Verse 1: Armageddon]
Sometimes I envious on peoples that past away
They so synonm, there wings being cast away
I dream so vivid, the scene shakes me fast awake
I keep thinking maybe somethings tryna show me how to master my faith

They say I'm deep and too complex for rap
But yo, I grew to learn there's more to life then cars and gats
So I chose to share the light and write my bars with that
But niggaz scared to grow so they tend to hold you back

They take this shit that they don't understand and call it wack
Tell you that ain't the way it goes son, that's conscience rap
But why'all running in circles working the same old act
And I done reaching at a level, but I'm wrong for that

And I ain't bitching, I'm just tryna let you know where I'm at
I'm getting old, as my son grows, so do my raps
I feel your misery, you living off the next mans life
He just as bad, 'cause he dreams you can strengthen his light

I want to shout out all the two time fellas holding guns for weak thugs
Risking their freedom, for short money and weak love
85 is tryna earn respect from them young boys
Catching temper tantroms, having fits like young boys

And bitches do it too, get deffensive and peranoid
See everybody want to have some power to exploit
Now maybe you can tell me who's the problem at this point
Me or you homes, I hope you following this joint

Niggaz tryna please the crowd when they creating their rhymes
I just be thinking out loud, why'all ain't gonna pay me no mind
Maybe I'm living in the clouds, or just ahead of my time
I got books of all the shit I wrote between all the crimes

Looking back, tryna trace tracks just to see what I find
Nothing but evidence, back to fact the world is mine
And I ain't irrogant, I'm just Intellectually pompous
'Cause I can super seed anything you accomplish

This nigga dry snitching like he looking for sympathy
Nobody give a fuck about you or your history
Do you nigga?Make some shit shop a deal
'Cause that hot shit you talkin could get you popped forreal

Take my advice, I sugested like a cotton a meal
If not, fuck it, you can starve and keep your eyes pealed
But, don't get me involved, I don't owe you shit
The same goes for that little bitch that's all on my dick

Your all just a bunch of misserable fucks
Broke, mad, drunk , high and gangsta'ed up
It's so sad, I wish that I could cry for him and her
I'm busy mastering this ?? tryna stay up

And their ain't no looking back, I got my crazy mind made up
My nigga L home just in time to witness me bust
Niggaz say and speak the truth, getty that's whatsup
Go in the booth, produce the proof, show these niggaz how to really give up

And that's when I peeped him, he was lookin so fresh and so cleaned up
From the fitted down to his sneakers
I really do mean this I ain't never seen this, there was some people standin in between us
I had to go over there so I could meet him I had him pimped up in the cut near the speakers
If he got a girl I know she's heated 'cause right now I'm all he needin
If he, crush me then trust me it's a guarantee that he's not leavin
Told me he heard of me but don't know me and I liked him for some reason
Invited him to my place, sat on his face and I ain't got a man so it ain't cheatin
Think about it now, I don't gotta stress, I don't never really gotta press, they always say yes
It seems like every other night I got a different nigga beggin me....

Spit you out, like a shot from a German luger
Now who want it, test my peoples I'll blast the boy
Pull out them twin desert eagles, like I'm Pastor Troy

And plush like four summers
But I've made it over them rough roads like old hummers

I just came to lay my name down, I work a hard shift
Show my talents to the world and expose my god gift
I was grown with hard end, many obstacles and fights
But I learned to heal my scars, like them doctors doing life
Keep it moving, cruising
Doing like a hundred and sixty
And I ain't stopping till them motherfucking cops come and get me
I survived my community
Took my opportunity
To get money and y'all mad cause I'm doing me (cut it out man)
I'm going south and I'm fishing
Stop that mouthing and bitching
Put your money on the table, I'll put you out of commission

Terrorvision,"Listening to the story of an angry old man
He had the whole world in his pocket but
He had a hole there in his hand
Never had much trouble fitting into his surroundings
Dived headlong into life
And ended up by drowning
Died by drowning
His blood is pure venom and his teeth are solid gold
His clothes are made from human skin
He's a thousand years old
He lives down by the poisoned stream
Where only alligators swim
Sits there drinking moonshine
Playing a mean violin a mean violin
A really wicked violin

You've got four lines on your forehead
And that tells me that you're worried
Don't shoot my dog
Don't shoot my dog
I said please don't shoot my dog

His wife is laying face down in the pool upon the porch
He spied me through his blindness
As I spied her with my torch
His skin goes tight around his face
As he smiles his blinding smile
Points over to a dozen wives laying in a pile
Laying in a pile pile high

When I feel a surge of self pity
In my house there's a place where I sit
And watch the violence on the telly

Where we eat drink and cook
And in my house there's an attic at the top
Where my sister and her boyfriend go
My house get down the stairs
My house 'till your dad gets home

About living in my house do as you're told
My house have you got that straight
My house if you wanna own it then you just better wait

In my house there's a bathroom
It's a lovely shade of green
In my house there's a best room
And mum keeps that real clean
In my house there's five bedrooms
And there's only four of us
In my house there's an alley down the back
And a hut that ain't up to much

Terrorvision,"He was born diseased with a twisted mind
His hands his feet his elbows tied
Sleeps by the day and in the night he crys
The bastard son of a travelling man
Conceived and born in a caravan
Lives where he could and comes out when he can
Death of a rock star played by an actor
Gotta make a film 'cause he died in a fast car
With lots of booze drugs and sex
Make him up a demi God invent all the rest
Like character john's been trying it on
To get his picture in the news
He took a leap from his pad
The same place that his dad
Choked on a video so blue

Looks up to the heavens as he falls from grace

But not as instant as the hit she got off one little bit
Might have a tattoo on her shoulder of a dagger and rose

All the gold in my walls are in hideaway halls
To cancel the chance of reprise

And their widow machine
Are taking the share of your sons
Then a note through the post
And the smell of a ghost

In New York City, to be exact
A bunch of artists and painters and

And architects
Started feeling real superior
To their ego counter parts
Out on the West Coast,
They all got together and decided
They would show those snotty surfer upstarts
A thing or two about the Big Apple
And they hired themselves a truck
It was a big spanking new white-shiny
Chrome-plated cab-over
Peterbilt
With mud flaps, stereo, TV, AM & FM radio,
Leather seats and a naugahide sleeper
All fresh
With new American Flag decals and ""ART ARK""
Printed on the side of the door
With solid 24 karat gold leaf type
And they filled up this truck
With the most significant piles
And influential heaps of Art Work
To ever be assembled in Modern Times,
And it sent it West no chide
Cajole, humble and humiliated the Golden Bear.
And this is the true story of that truck
A Truckload of Art
From New York City
Came rollin down the road
Yeah the driver was singing
And the sunset was pretty
But the truck turned over
And she rolled off the road

All over the ground
And it's a terrible sight

Then dig a deep ditch
And throw the arts in a hole

On the highway at night

When I beheld an amazing sight
It was a lonely apparition
By the roadside standing there
With his thumb out in the wilderness
And a halo in his hair

He said ""Gimme a ride to heaven boy
I'll Show you paradise
Yeah gimme a ride to heaven boy

Where things are going bad

So I jammed her down in gear
Kind a kicked my feet beneath the seat

I know you must think it's odd
But you got nothin to fear about drinkin a beer
If you share it with the son of God""

Well I saw good news in his baby blues
So I stomped it on the floor
I said you have to show me how to get there
I ain't been before
""Well it's a hard place to find"" he said
""But I'll give you a little clue
It ain't somewhere up in the air
Its sittin right here inside with you""
Then right in the middle of that perfect smile
From his robes he pulled a gun
An stuck it up beside my head and said
""How's this for Kingdom Come?""
Well I pulled off scared but I heard him say
As he left me beneath the stars
""The Lord moves in mysterious ways
and tonight, my son ... He's gonna use your car""

Down Main Street after midnight with a brand new pack of cigs
A fresh one hangin' from her lips and a beer between her legs
She'd ride down to the river and meet with all her friends
The road goes on forever and the party never ends

Sonny was a loner he was older than the rest
He was going into the Navy but he couldn't pass the test
So he hung around town he sold a little pot
The law caught wind of Sonny and one day he got caught
But he was back in business when they set him free again
The road goes on forever and the party never ends

Sonny's playin' 8-ball at the joint where Sherry works
When some drunken outta towner put his hand up Sherry's skirt
Sonny took his pool cue laid the drunk out on the floor
Stuffed a dollar in her tip jar and walked on out the door
She's runnin' right behind him reachin' for his hand
The road goes on forever and the party never ends

They jumped into his pickup Sonny jammed her down in gear
Sonny looked at Sherry and said lets get on outta here
The stars were high above them and the moon was in the east
The sun was settin' on them when they reached Miami Beach
They got a hotel by the water and a quart of Bombay gin
The road goes on forever and the party never ends

They soon ran out of money but Sonny knew a man
Who knew some Cuban refugees that delt in contraband
Sonny met the Cubans in a house just off the route
With a briefcase full of money and a pistol in his boot
The cards were on the table when the law came bustin' in
The road goes on forever and the party never ends

The Cubans grabbed the goodies and Sonny grabbed the Jack
He broke a bathroom window and climbed on out the back
Sherry drove the pickup through the alley on the side
Where a lawman tackled Sonny and was reading him his rights
She stepped into the alley with a single shot .410
The road goes on forever and the party never ends

They left the lawman lyin' and they made their getaway
They got back to the motel just before the break of day
Sonny gave her all the money and he blew her a little kiss
If they ask you how this happened say I forced you into this
She watched him as his taillights disappeared around the bend
The road goes on forever and the party never ends

Its Main Street after midnight just like it was before
21 months later at the local grocery store
Sherry buys a paper and a cold 6-pack of beer
The headlines read that Sonny is goin' to the chair
She pulls back onto Main Street in her new Mercedes Benz
The road goes on forever and the party never ends

Terry Allen,"Hey Remember all those
psychedelic nights
When your head come loose
and floated into the lights
And all them girls
without any tops at all
Down in the dirt uhhh huhh
After the Fall
And Remember how all the
fantasies worked
Little flags in front of the tract homes
by the church
It's a wonder anything's left
to hurt at all
Down in the dirt uhhh huhh
After the Fall
Yea 

Remember the flower children
and their shit-eating grins
Wearing buckskin building teepees
trying to be Indians
An Remember the reservation
with the drunks against the wall
Peddling turquoise to the tourists
Down in the dirt uhhh huhh
After the Fall

Remember the Holy Road
running red
With blood from the mouths of mystics
when they said
""Let's eat flesh from the knees of Jesus
while he crawls""
Down in the dirt uhhh huhh
After the Fall
Yeah 

Remember the Christian Soldiers
armed to the teeth beneath the stars
Watching the jungle burn
from beside their armored cars
We saw it all on TV
while we ate just what we saw
So we could partake in history
without our names on the Wall or
Down in the dirt uhhh huhh
After the Fall
(repeat first verse)
",After the Fall,1996
Terry Allen,"Every night the same light shines
From your eyes and back to mine
With a vision of the love
We thought was true
But the darkness of the world out there
Surrounds the love we thought we shared
And it all fades back to black
Tween me and you
But me and you we're not to blame
Love always returns from where it came
Back to black and in the end
It's all the same

Now the darkness has slipped inside
But neither one of us can hide
Though you act for me
Just like I act for you
But when out two fates did cross
We should have both guessed the cost
That it all fades back to black
And nothing's new

But me and you we're not to blame
Love always returns from where it came
Back to black and in the end
It's all the same

So if some mirror up on the wall
Reflected the love that we once saw
We could stand there forever
And never move
But loves' picture in the glass
Fades away it never lasts
It just all fades back to black
And nothing's true

But me and you we're not to blame
Love always returns from where it came
Back to black and in the end
It's all the same
Back to black for me and you
Is back to blue

When you say the things, you say you gotta mean it 
And when you do the things you do, it's gotta come from the heart 

 Something's gone, I can't explain 
The heat is missing from the plain 
Can't deny it, there's a link missing from the chain 
There's something wrong with you and me 
When more than one adds up to three 
Don't know the reason, but the fact is plain to see 
It's the touch that you lose, and the words you don't say 
It's our love you abuse, don't you throw it away 

 When you do what you do that you do to me 
Don't you know that it ain't enough 
When you do what you do it don't mean a thing 
when you do what you do without love, without love 

 I'm gonna paint a picture of you 
The only colour I need is blue 
You're out of love, baby you know it's true 
Tell me why and I'll try to understand 

 Cause I can cry when you do what you do to me 
Don't you know that it ain't enough 
When you do what you do it don't mean a thing 
When you do what you do without love 

 It's the touch that you lose, and the words you don't say 
It's the love you refuse, don't you throw it away 

 When you do what you do that you do to me 
Don't you know that it ain't enough 
When you do what you do it don't mean a thing 
Then you know it's a crime that you kill me up 
When you do what you do without love, without love 
Don't know what you're doing, what you're doing without love",Do What You Do,1991

'Til you've learned the meaning of the blues
Until you've loved a love you've had  to lose,
You don't know what love  is.

You don't know how lips hurt
Until you've kissed and had to pay the cost,
Until you've flipped your heart and you have lost,
You don't know what love is.

Do you know how a lost heart fears
At the thought of reminiscing,
And how lips that taste of tears
Lose their taste for kissing?
You don't know how hearts burn
For love that can, not live yet never dies.
Until you've faced each dawn with sleepless eyes,
You don't know what love is.",You Don't Know What Love Is,1999
Terry Callier,"In the mornin' you go gunnin' for the man who stole your water
And you fire till he is done in but they catch you at the border

You go back, Jack, do it again, wheels turinin' 'round and 'round
You go back, Jack, do it again

When you know she's no high climber then you find your only friend
In a room with your two timer, and you're sure you're near the end
Then you love a little wild one, and she brings you only sorrow
All the time you know she's smilin'; you'll be on your knees tomorrow

[Chorus]

Now you swear and kick and beg us that yopu're not a gamblin' man;
Then you find you're back in Vegas with a handle in your hand
Your black cards can bring you money so you hide them when you're able
In the land of milk and honey you must put them on the table

Terry Callier,"These are sad times
Your eyes have told me so
Blue and black times
You think that I don't know
But there'll be glad times
Just you wait and see
And I'll be your sunrise if you'll lean on me

I imagine that I could comfort you
I have forgotten the things that you've been through
But here's one thing
On which we can agree
When you're ailing darlin' you can lean on me

And the love I bring
Will grow into a lasting thing
Put your heart on wings
That set you free
And as you rise
Up into the clearing skies
Maybe you will realize
You can lean on me

All your heartaches
Are hidden deep inside
So there's no telling
How many tears you've cried
But like the river
Told the weeping willow tree
I can hold your tear drops

Não sai de mim, não sai

Que coisa linda, que coisa louca

Hão de ser milhões de abraços

You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms

Tells his fairytale
Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain
My stardust melody

Will be left far behind

Time to live your life, release those old delusions
Stop wasting time and start embracing
His light and let it shine

Count your blessings when they say
Oh it ain't no way but what matters
Never stop believing in yourself
But in the Lord God and you'll see
All the answers that free you from change

Terry Dexter,"[Verse 1]
I never thought it was possible.
In my reality
I thought my chances for love were gone.
That time ran out for me.

My heart has been through some changes.
And heaven knows
What I thought was my everlove was so conditional

But my love, everyday with you I'm so surprised
Morning comes, I fall in love again
Each night, I'm thanking God you're in my life
I don't know how I know, but this feeling won't be ending

[Chorus]
You're my everlove
Oh, my everlove
Everlasting through all changes in our lives

You're my everlove
You're my everlove
Ever growing everyday and every night
I found my everlove

[Verse 2]
I'll never ask for perfection
That's how a love can slip away
I only ask for the truth in your heart
The rest we'll work out day by day

You've seen the best and worst of me
But you're still standing here, oh
There is nothing that can stop us now
Cause we've got nothing left to fear

The future will show the power of a moment just like this
Whatever love can dream we both will know
Whatever we imagine will exist
Every kiss, I swear my life, will be deserving of your

[Chorus]

Everlove
You're my everlove
Ever giving, ever learning with every cry
I found my everlove

[Bridge]
The winds of change will blow
Your friends may come, may go
Each struggle in life may put us through the fire
But as long as I'm alive
I'll be right there by your side

[Chorus]

Everlove
You're my everlove
Ever growing everyday and every night
I found my everlove",Everlove,2008

This old world turns around for lovers like you
It's not The Way Love Turned Out For Me.
 
People in love build a house they can share
Takes a long time to get it just right
But a fire can start in the kitchen somewhere
And burn that little house down overnight

Another man held that fire 
Burned our house to the ground
That's The Way Love Turned Out For Me.

Pretty flowers turn out in the spring
And the light turns out in the kitchen
When somebody pulls on the string

And no doors open up with my key
And I ain't got no one to turn to

Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms
The nightingale 
Tells his fairytale
Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain
My stardust melody
The memory of love's refrain.",Stardust,1959
Terry Gibbs,"Never thought I'd fall,
But now I hear love call,
I'm getting sentimental over you

Things you say and do,
Just thrill me through and through,
I'm getting sentimental over you.

I thought I was happy,
I could live without love
Now I must admit,
Love is all I'm thinking of

Won't you please be kind,
And just make up your mind
That you'll be sweet & gentle,
Be gentle with me
Because I'm sentimental over you

It must have been moonglow that led me straight to you

Terry Gibbs,"I hear music when I look at you,
A beautiful theme of every
Dream I ever knew.
Down deep in my heart I hear it play.
I feel it start, then melt away.

I hear music when I touch your hand,
A beautiful melody
From some enchanted land.
Down deep in my heart, I hear it say,
Is this the day?

I alone have heard this lovely strain,
I alone have heard this glad refrain,
Must it be forever inside of me,
Why can't I let it go,
Why can't I let you know,
Why can't I let you know the song
My heart would sing?

Of love and youth and spring,
The music is sweet,

The song is you.",The Song Is You,1959
Terry Gibbs,"Our love is a dream, but in my reverie
I can see that this love was meant for me
Only a poor fool never schooled in the whirlpool
Of romance could be so cruel as you are to me

Without you life will never begin to be
So love me as I love you in my reverie
Make my dream a reality 
Let's dispense with formality
Come to me in my reverie

Operas and nursery rhymes have been overdone
I dug a little deeper and I found this thing

I can see water and moonlight beaming
Silver waves that break on some undiscovered shore - Then
Suddenly, I see it all change
Long winter nights with the candles gleaming
Through it all your face that I adore.

A little room where all the roses bloom
I want to lead you into Nature's hall
Where ev'ry year the roses give a ball
They have an orchestra up in the trees
For their musicians are the birds and bees
And they will sing us a song
As we are strolling along
 
In sunny Roseland, where summer breezes are playing
Where the honey bees are ""A-Maying""
There all the roses are swaying
Dancing while the meadow brook flows
The moon when shining is more than ever designing
For 'tis ever then I am pining
Pining to be sweetly reclining

Their little kisses are so short and sweet
The lilies nod to the forget-me-nots
When they're departing in their flower pots

Remain to love until they droop and die

Terry Gibbs,"If you could see me now, you'd know how blue I've been
One look is all you'd need to see the mood I'm in.
Perhaps then you'd realize I'm still in love with you.
If you could see me now, you'd find me being brave
And trying awfully hard to make my tears behave
But that's quite impossible, I'm still in love with you.
 
You'll happen my way on some mem'rable day
And the month will be May for a while.
I'll try to smile but can I play the part
Without my heart behind the smile?
 
The way I feel for you I never could disguise
The look of love is written plainly in my eyes.
I think you'd be mine again if you could see me now.",If You Could See Me Now,2004

Terry Gibbs,"The news is out all over town that you've been seen a runnin' 'round
I know that I should leave but then I just can't go you win again
This heart of mine could never see what everybody knew but me
Just trusting you was my great sin what can I do you win again

I'm sorry for your victim now 'cause soon his head like mine will bow
He'll give his heart but all in vain and someday say you win again
You have no heart you have no shame you take true love and give the blame
I guess that I should not complain I love you still you won again",You Win Again,2004
Terry Gibbs,"Look at me
I'm as helpless as a kitten up a tree
And I feel like I'm clinging to a cloud
I can't understand
I get misty, holding your hand

Walk my way
And a thousand violins begin to play
Or it might be the sound of your hello
That music I hear
I get misty the moment you're near

You can say that you're leading me on
But it's just what I want you to do
Don't you realize how hopelessly I'm lost
That's why I'm following you

On my own
Would I wander through this wonderland alone
Never knowing my right foot from my left
My hat from my glove
I get misty, and too much in love

I'm too misty, and too much in love",Misty,2005

I hate to see that evening sun go down

I'll pack my truck and make my give-a-way

St. Louis woman with her diamond ring
Pulls that man around by her, if it wasn't for her and her
That man I love would have gone nowhere, nowhere

I got the St. Louis blues, blues as I can be
That man's got a heart like a rock cast in the sea
Or else he wouldn't have gone so far from me

Never tell me dreams come true

I never want to hear from any cheerful Pollyannas
Who tell you fate supplies a mate
It's all bananas

They're writing songs of love but not for me
A lucky star's above but not for me
With love to lead the way I've found more clouds of gray
Than any Russian play could guarantee

I was a fool to fall and get that way
Hi-ho, alas, and also lack-a-day
Although I can't dismiss the memory of his kiss
I guess he's not for me

I never wink back at fireflies
But now that the stars are in your eyes
I'm beginning to see the light

I never went in for afterglow
Or candlelight on the mistletoe
But now when you turn the lamp down low
I'm beginning to see the light

Used to ramble through the park
Shadowboxing in the dark
Then you came and caused a spark
That's a four-alarm fire now

I never made love by lantern-shine
I never saw rainbows in my wine
But now that your lips are burning mine
I'm beginning to see the light",I'm Beginning to See the Light,2008

That's the kind of magic music we get from our lips

He really knows how to cry 
That's how I'd cry in my pillow 
If you should tell me farewell and goodbye

Kiss me sweet, then we'll go 
Flying high in birdland, high in the sky up above

Terry Gibbs,"The falling leaves drift by the window
The autumn leaves of red and gold
I see your lips, the summer kisses
The sun-burned hands I used to hold

Since you went away the days grow long
And soon I'll hear old winter's song
But I miss you most of all my darling
When autumn leaves start to fall

Speak low, darling speak low,
Love is a spark lost in the dark,
Too soon, too soon,

That tomorrow is near, tomorrow is here
And always too soon.

Love is pure gold and time a thief.

I'm somewhere in another world, alone with you
Sharing all the joys we used to know
Many moons ago

Once again your face comes back to me
Just like the theme of some forgotten melody
In the album of my memory
Serenade in blue

It seems like only yesterday
The small cafe, a crowded floor
And as we danced the night away
I hear you say forever more
And then the song became a sigh
Forever more became goodbye
Cause you remained in my heart, but

Tell me darling in there still a spark?
Or only lonely ashes of the flame we knew
Should I go on whistling in the dark,

Ain't no doubt about it

I love you, baby I love you

And leave me sittin' here to cry 
But if it's all the same to you baby 
I'm gonna stop you from sayin' goodbye

Out my head by half past ten 
Out with mates and dates and friends 
That's what I do at weekends 
I can't talk and I can't walk 
But I know where I'm going to go 
I'm going watch my money go 
At the Locarno, no 

When my feet go through the door 
I know what my right arm is for 
Buy a drink and pull a chair 
Up to the edge of the dance floor 
Bouncers bouncing through the night 
Trying to stop or start a fight 
I sit and watch the flashing lights 
Moving legs in footless tights 

I go out on Friday night and I come home on Saturday morning 
I go out on Friday night and I come home on Saturday morning 

I like to venture into town 
I like to get a few drinks down 
The floor gets packed the bar gets full 
I don't like life when things get dull 
The hen party have saved the night 
And freed themselves from drunken stags 
Having fun and dancing in 
A circle round their leather bags 

I go out on Friday night and I come home on Saturday morning 
I go out on Friday night and I come home on Saturday morning 

But two o'clock has come again 
It's time to leave this paradise 
Hope the chip shop isn't closed 
'Cause their pies are really nice 
I'll eat in the taxi queue 
Standing in someone else's spew 
Wish I had lipstick on my shirt 
Instead of piss stains on my shoes

Why must you record my phone calls?
Are you planning a bootleg LP?
Said you've been threatened by gangsters
Now it's you, that's threatening me

Can't fight corruption with con tricks
They use the law to commit crime
And I dread, dread to think what the future will bring
When we're living in gangster time

Don't call me scar face

Can't interrupt while I'm talking
Or they'll confiscate all your guitars
And catch 22 says if I sing the truth
They won't make me an overnight star

Down a hollow to a cavern where the sun has never shone

Lovers walking along a shore and leave their footprints in the sand
Is the sound of distant drumming just the fingers of your hand?
Pictures hanging in a hallway and the fragment of a song
Half remembered names and faces, but to whom do they belong?
When you knew that it was over you were suddenly aware
That the autumn leaves were turning to the color of her hair!

Enjoy yourself and have lots of fun 
So glad and live life longer than you've ever done 

Enjoy yourself, it's later than you think 
Enjoy yourself, while you're still in the pink 
The years go by, as quickly as you wink 
Enjoy yourself, enjoy yourself, it's later than you think 

Never right, yes I know 
Get wisdom, knowledge and understanding 
These three, were given free by the maker 
Go to school, learn the rules, don't be no faker 
It's not wise for you to be a foot stool 

Enjoy yourself, it's later than you think 
Enjoy yourself, while you're still in the pink 
The years go by, as quickly as you wink 
Enjoy yourself, enjoy yourself, it's later than you think

We danced and sang as the music played in any boomtown
This town (town) is coming like a ghost town

They talk about us 
Telling lies 
Well that's no surprise 

Can you see them 
See right through them 
They have no shield 
No secrets to reveal 

It doesn't matter what they say 
In the jealous games people play 
Our lips are sealed  

Careless talk 
Through paper walls 
We can't stop them 
Only laugh at them 

Spreading rumors 
So far from true 
Dragged up from the underworld 
Just like some precious pearl 

It doesn't matter what they say 
In the jealous games people play 
Our lips are sealed 
Pay no mind to what they say 
It doesn't matter anyway 
Our lips are sealed 

There's a weapon 
We must use 
In our defense 
Silence 

When you look at them 
Look right through them

That's when you'll be feared

It's so deep and it's so quiet too
There's just too many people everywhere
I wish that I was down there

So duck your head and swim for shore

One more time, oh no never
A promise to myself
And next time I'd better just
Forget about love

If you see me bend or weak in the knees
Say ""Forget about love"" 

Forget about love
forget about love
Enough is enough
Say forget about love ",Forget About Love,1995
Terry Lee Hale,"My wanderings had taken me far from my home
I met a pretty woman said she's tired of being alone
Well one thing led to another
You know how things go
So we packed her up and headed back
To my little Texas home
Well I told her once and I told her twice
It's the best that I could do
Life in Tornado alley is where I live, don't be confused
But she was quite insistent, professed to me her love
I warned her where I lived
Now she's moved here and it's done
Storm seasons always come, storm seasons go
Never seems to stay the same but the wind always blows
Uncomfortable summer, cold in winter times
Very, very few moments when everything's just right
But me, I've always lived here
Yes I've been born and raised
It's funny what you can get used to
If you take the time and don't count the days
It's mostly just flat land, not much to see
And I know she's bored and probably blames it all on me
And I'm sure it is quite different, it's not what she thought
Tornado alley's not a dream, but it's sure as hell what she got
Then of course there come a time a storm came roaring through
And I seen the look in her eyes, wondering what the hell she got herself in to
Wish nowhere to run, nowhere to hide
From a freight train running through the middle of a room
Just want out alive
But me, I've always lived here
Yes I've been born and raised
It's funny what you can get used to
If you take the time and don't count the days
Well after that, things changed, she said something about the fall
And how the waters rushed and roared, I heard a coyote call
On and on, long stories, of places I'd never seen
She'd get that faraway look in her eyes that did not include me
Maybe I should have known, there's something about this place
And unlike the wind that blows through here, she's gone without a trace
Well me, I just go on, but back to being alone
Tornado alley's where I live and have always called my home
'Cause me, I've always lived here
Yes I've been born and raised
It's funny how you can get used to
If you take the time
If you take the time",Tornado Alley,1995
Terry Lee Hale,"Revived, coffin break. suffocated. I couldn't wait,
It's ten below and a black top road
Nobody's out there. tonight it's lonely passing through
I think a drink is due. I'll take two 

Out of Cheyenne into piney woods, this drive will do me good
Remembering what she said what she said
I'm not your enemy no, I'm now it. can't you see
It's the pass that binds, that's not an alibi
But you never try, why don't you ever try?

I remember a wishing well
Where we stood and whose hand that I held
And the coin that was tossed and what it got
Cigarette smoke and empty roads, it's 4 AM a stupid joke

On a list I'm alone
Einstein. barfly. which one what's the face tonight

Terry Lightfoot,"'t was on the Isle of Capri that I found her 
Beneath the shade of an old walnut tree 
Oh, I can still see the flowers blooming round her 
Where we met on the Isle of Capri 

She was as sweet as a rose at the dawning 
But somehow fate hadn't meant her for me 
And though I sailed with the tide in the morning 
Still my heart's on the Isle of Capri 

Summertime was nearly over

I said ""Lady, I'm a rover, 
Can you spare a sweet word of love?"" 

She whispered softly ""It's best not to linger"" 
And then as I kissed her hand I could see 
She wore a lovely meatball on her finger

And miss it each night and day

I dream about magnolias in bloom

Terry Lightfoot,"How we danced, as we dreamed at the Mardi Gras
Was romance what it seemed at the Mardi Gras
Was the love that we made just a brief masquerade
Was it gone with the song that the orchestra played
With a sigh, with a glance at the moon above
Was it just by chance we spoke of love
Or did you somehow feel that the wonder was real

Until you've loved a love you've had  to lose,

Until you've kissed and had to pay the cost,
Until you've flipped your heart and you have lost,

At the thought of reminiscing,
And how lips that taste of tears
Lose their taste for kissing?

As the time flies

Cold and driven

No goodness improve me

No lesson could teach me
How I could have love her and made her love me too 
If I can't love her, then who?
Long ago I should have seen
All the things I could have been
Careless and unthinking, I moved onward
No pain could be deeper
No life could be cheaper
No point anymore, if I can't love her
No spirit could win me
No hope left within me
Hope I could have loved her and that she'd set me free

Who I followed like a star
And suddenly you changed
And now I don't know who you are
Or could it be that I never really knew you from the start

Terry Nelson,"Once upon a time there was a little boy who wanted to grow up
And be a soldier and serve his country in whatever way he could
He would parade around the house with a sauce pan on his head
For a helmet, a wooden sword in one hand and the American flag in the other
As he grew up, he put away the things of a child but he never let go of the flag
My name is William Calley, I'm a soldier of this land
I've tried to do my duty and to gain the upper hand

But they've made me out a villain they have stamped me with a brand
As we go marching on
I'm just another soldier from the shores of U.S.A.
Forgotten on a battle field then thousand miles away
While life goes on as usual from New York to Santa Fe
As we go marching on
I've seen my buddies ambushed on the left and on the right

And their youthful bodies riddled by the bullets of the night
Where all the rules are broken and the only law is might
As we go marching on
While we're fighting in the jungles they were marching in the street
While we're dying in the rice fields they were helping our defeat
While we're facing V.C. bullets they were sounding a retreat
As we go marching on

With our sweat we took the bunkers, with our tears we took the plain
With our blood we took the mountains and they gave it back again
Still all of us are soldiers, we're too busy to complain
As we go marching on
When I reach my final campground in that land beyond the sun
And the great commander asks me, ""Did you fight or did you run?""
I'll stand both straight and tall stripped of medals, rank and gun
And this is what I'll say

Sir, I followed all my orders and I did the best I could
It's hard to judge the enemy and hard to tell the good
Yet there's not a man among us would not have understood
We took the jungle village exactly like they said
We responded to their rifle fire with everything we had
And when the smoke had cleared away a hundred souls lay dead
Sir, the soldier that's alive is the only once can fight

There's no other way to wage a war when the only one in sight
That you're sure is not a VC is your buddy on your right
When all the wars are over and the battle's finally won
Count me only as a soldier who never left his gun
With the right to serve my country as the only prize I've won
As we go marching on
Glory, glory hallelujah glory, glory hallelujah",Battle Hymn of Lt. Calley,2010

Ain't much more soul to get round to
Lessening of companies that are finding
Things to bind to it anymore

I'd hate to just realise why
That company's getting so shy
The bairns don't have get-togethers
Round here not anymore

Mother I hear for the laddies
Talking 'bout going on down to
The town where the money's just bound to
Surely just ease the door

It's happening all over the city
There ain't much more doubt
To get down to
Lessening of reasons
That can send you
Back down for more

They're telling their sisters of why
Feelings that pass them close by
All that they seek
Is what they're wanting to keep
And it's glistening right there in their eyes

So mother I fear for the laddies
Father says no one goes down to
The face of some mine no boy of mine's
Gonna be bound to, anymore

The future, a brave new awakening
Have to no more go back down to
The bowels of this earth that will take you
Away from home and more",Brave Awakening,1976
Terry Reid,"Can you hear what I've been thinkin'
Do you hear my words out loud?
Cause there's an echo that's insistent,
Why doesn't the phone ring out now
But when it does it rings no question, but when it don't I wonder why, 
Baby got somewhere you can reach me on this dark and lonely night.

oooohhhh, what a faith to arise...yeah
Feel that look in your eyes
You know I'll be thinkin we'll be bringin that
Time and place in your mind,
And you need a lesson to hang on too, 
Feel what it is that's alive

and you know that it's only one more day, 
That I'm gonna be this far away,
And now I'm sitting here on this phone, I've run out of things to say...
Cept this is gonna feel good to get back home
Now itt's gonna feel good to just get back home
I've been out here stretchin on my own,
And now it's gonna feel good to just get back home

I take a plane out in the morning
Puts me in tomorrow night
Got something I want to say to you 
On the hours that I lose in this flight
There's a beauty about london, though the rain's still pouring down
It only makes me thinking of breakin', so the night wakes, and breaks and shakes the ground.

and oohhhh....what a faith to arise,,,yeah
See that look in your eyes 
You know you'll be thinkin' you'll be singin' bout that time and place in your mind
Sun and you let them grown on into
Be what it is that's alive
You know that time she's a passer of everyday
Know what it is =, no one you can save
Just write your name in the sky, with the curve of the earth of night.
Now it's the end of the turn, I can see the reflection in your eyes
So now it's gonna feel good to get back home

The lot we used to pass by every day

Just walk away Renee
You won't see me follow you back home

From deep inside the tears that I'm forced to cry
From deep inside the pain that I chose to hide

Just walk away Renee
You won't see me follow you back home

For me it cries

Got shoes and money, good friends too

And I know what's going on
And I know that the way is too long
And I know just exactly what's on your mind
But you'll be back and I'll lose them forever

'Cause I'm wondering why, now, should I ask your name
All the people standing by, all there in the game
Love is just a story, a story without words
Words that always never seen and never even heard

And I know what's going on
And I know that the way is too long
And I know just exactly what's on your mind
But you'll be back and I'll lose them forever

Know my good times, just angels
I got shoes and money, good friends, too
No, I always play to win and always seem to lose
That's why I think I got a rich kid's blues
That's why I think I got a rich kid's blues

And I'll say to wave back and just lose them forever

Tiny tots with their eyes all aglow
Will find it hard to sleep tonight.

And every mother's child is gonna spy
To see if reindeer really know how to fly.

They're gonna build a Toyland all around the Christmas tree
So! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
 
Now Santa is a busy man, He has no time to play
He's got millions of stockings to fill on Christmas day
You'd better write your letter now
And mail it right away
Because he's getting ready
His reindeer's and his sleigh. So

I'd take it back

His heart is not always wise
This is a man who stumbles and falls, but this is a man who tries
This is a man you’ll forgive and forgive
And help protect, as long as you live
He may not always say what you would have him say
But now and then he’ll say something wonderful
The thoughtless things he’ll do will hurt and worry you
Then all at once he’ll do something wonderful
He has a thousand dreams that won’t come true
You know that he believes in them and that’s enough for you
You’ll always go along, defend him when he’s wrong
And tell him when he’s strong, he is wonderful
He’ll always need your love, and so he’ll get your love

Terry Wood,"[Ashley:] Mary-Kate, our ride is here!
[Mary-Kate:] A horse?
[Ashley:] And a sleigh.
[Mary-Kate:] All right!

Sleigh ride! Sleigh ride!
Go Terry!
Just hear those sleigh bells jingling,
Ring, ting-tingling too 
(Sleigh ride)
Come on, it's lovely weather
For a sleigh ride together with you. 

Outside the snow is falling 
And friends are calling ""Yoo hoo,""

Come on, it's lovely weather 
For a sleigh ride together with you.

Giddy up, giddy up, giddy up, 
Let's go, let's look at the show. 
We're riding in a wonderland of snow. 
Giddy yap, giddy yap, giddy yap, 
It's grand, just holding your hand. 
We're gliding along with a song 
Of a wintry fairy land. 

Our cheeks are nice and rosy
And comfy cozy are we
(Sleigh ride, sleigh ride)
We're snuggled up together
Like two birds of a feather should be
Let's take that road before us 
And sing a chorus or two 
(Sleigh ride, sleigh ride)
Come on, it's lovely weather 
For a sleigh ride together with you.

There's a birthday party 
At the home of Farmer Gray. 
It'll be the perfect ending of a perfect day. 
We'll be singing the songs 
We love to sing without a single stop, 
At the fireplace while we watch the chestnuts pop. 
Pop! Pop! Pop!

There's a happy feeling
Nothing in the world can buy,
When they pass around the coffee
And the pumpkin pie
It'll nearly be like a picture print

These wonderful things are the things 
We remember all through our lives!

Yo, what the deal honey, insecure, feeling funny
I know you're used to dealing with cats with real money
Also know you like Mase in alot of ways
But it's hard to go on when your lonely on the holidays
When you shop should you shop for two
Take you where the waters aqua blue
Let you fall back, treat you like you all that
Under umbrellas with your shades and your straw hat
You ain't the one out clubbin' all day and all night
Just to save a fight you say what's right
And I know he ain't the cat that will stay in your life
Even though he gave you ice that'll make you his wife
How a man deserve you if he hurt you
How you give a woman 25 a curfew
Between me and you, you ain't heard that from me
'Cause Mase ain't the player with the PHD

Is it somethin' that I said

It's gonna be O.K.

To forget about yesterday. And I

Alright!
Hey, are we ready?

Well I'm a mean machine, I'm the kind you don't wanna meet
My middle name is trouble, I'm a danger in the street
My motor's in overdrive, my pedal's to the floor
I never get enough, I'm always comin' back for more

Here I come, better step aside
I said here I come, oh yeah, well I'm a-comin' at you live
I'm comin' atcha live

The only one you want, I never give a warning twice
Well anything could happen like the rollin' of the dice

Here we come, you better step aside

Back home, sit down and patch my bones, and get back truckin' on

What in the hell ever happened to sweet Jane?
She's lost her marbles, you know the chick ain't the same
Livin' on reds, and vitamin see, and cocaine
All the friend can say is ""ain't it a bitch""

Busted down on Bourbon Street, set up like a bowlin' pin
Knocked down, sometimes I'm wearin' thin, they just won't let you in

Sometimes the light's all shinin' on me, other times I can barely see
Lately it occurs to me, what a long strange trip is this - that's right

Alright! You guys liked that one, right?
(Just like at home, that's pretty good...)

Hang on a second, I gotta tune up here, or tune down, actually
Alright! We're just fuckin' round tonight, but we're gonna have a good time

Give you more than you could ever want from me

Cry, cry an ocean
No use tryin' to hide what's slowly dying in me, what's slowly dying in me

Now I will confess, was no second guess
With all your love you left to me, it was a mess
Once there was a time, was no compromising
You [left so life can't do possess]

If anything they say is true, what goes around will be coming to you, I know
Some night, there'll be nothing you can do, but

Cry, do you feel that it's over
What you may fear is still alive, it's slowly dying in me

I cried, guess you're crying now

Its been like this to be gone,
I found the strength to carry on.

One Day at a time,
No Mountains to climb
But sometimes it don?t come easy.
One day at a time,
Or I lose my mind
That?s all I can do believe me.

(Solo)

Its been like this for to long,
I found a way to carry on.

(Chorus x2)
One Day at a time,
No Mountains to climb
But sometimes it don?t come easy.
One day at a time,
Or I lose my mind
That?s all I can do believe me.

One Day at a time,
No Mountains to climb
But sometimes it don?t come easy.
One day at a time,
Or I lose my mind
That?s all I can do believe me.
One Day at a time,
One Day at a time.

Of living like a ghost
God only knows

I cover up scars
That emptiness has caused
When the chemicals take
Will it be me you dream of

In the darkness, sleepless
Love, I wanna have you near

Never sleep alone
Never sleep alone

The moment before sleep
You're calling out
The demons inside me
And when they're gone
The hours I'm awake

And pray to god they'll take

Tess Wiley,"Coming out of sleepy season.
Waking up to make this mine.
Treading into deeper water.
I can't wait to see what I might find.
It's not like where I was with others.
I can't imagine why I stayed.
Fighting stubborn, pathetic genius.
Sleeping soundly where they were laid.
I can't find the balance in between,
It's such a skinny little line.
I'll close my eyes but won't let go,
It might just turn out fine.
I tried to teach me dull perfection,
But I hope I never learn.
I won't dismiss my situation.

How long before you don't want to get up out of bed?
Where are the angels, and how can they leave you so alone?

Peeling back layers, I'm feeling the weight this far away.
It's stealing the favor from me fast.

I am with you, holding your heart.
It's too heavy inside your delicate skin.
I am with you, but it tears me apart.
I can't hold you to blame for somebody
Else's sin.

Just swallow the bullshit with a spoonful of salt to kill the seed.

Too much affection, and too much laying it down.
I'm too tired for your old familiar frown.
Too much trusting that we're seeing every side.
Too much trust can damage anybody's pride.
Are you happy now? are you better off
Without the sacrifice I made for you?
Too much acting, I can't believe you anymore.

It's beyond weakness, add betrayal to the score.
No more talking, because if that's what trust's about,
I've got nothing left to say. you've turned all reason inside out.

You pulled the floor out from my feet?

That I could leave him spinning in his seat.
No matter how much I protest,
No matter how much I'm blessed,
I'll always have to prove myself to me.
I can't let it go. I don't know what they might think of me,
And I know I shouldn't care, but I can't let it go.
I don't know how I should feel.
Never in one million years would I have ever thought I hear
Such phantasmic projections from him.
Now I'm left with too much time
To gather clever ways in mind
To make him feel as worthless as I do.

Clearly they're not smart enough to
Deal with things right.

Would give the strength to face themselves.",Idle,2007
