Coucheron,"Rain is good for the soul
Crazy how I feel the most warm when it's cold
Drops hit the window and I drop down to the floor
I assume this is when I would miss you the most
I'm lying down
I've got this notepad where you laid your head
We use to go round and round
Making love in my bed
We were in so deep
We could barely tread
But now I found a way to heal myself instead

And damn I feel alive
Baby, damn I feel alive
It's like something has to die
To help you realize
Damn I feel alive

We were in a weird place
Crazy how a person you love could just change
Now I am learning to realize we needed our space
I could never hurt you, we use to be great
And you use to say, what goes around comes around so fast
Now just look at the way
I'm moving on and you stuck in the past
I deserve a love that is gonna last
But until then I will just raise this glass

And damn I feel alive
Baby, damn I feel alive
It's like something has to die
To help you realize
Damn I feel alive

I feel, I feel
Turn this song up if you feel alive
I feel, you feel
Let it all go cause right now's the time
Let go, live on
So you can be free, yeah free to fly
I know it's hard but it's worth it

And damn I feel alive
Baby, damn I feel alive
It's like something has to die
To help you realize
Damn I feel alive",Alive,2015

Count Basic,"Late at night
The lights rush by
I'm on the road again
Another town
Another crowd to face
But this feeling I'd never replace

I got to do what I do
But nothing lasts forever
Soon I'll be back by your side
I got to do what I do
We'll be together
Until the end of time

Fear and doubts
Running through my mind
What have I done with my life
Then I think of you
And I know for sure
I can take it all again
I got to do ...

Baby hold on a little while
I promise I'm gonna stay this time
I need to know that you wait for me
Please try to understand why
",Got to Do,1996
Count Basic,"So far away
Doesn't anybody stay in one place any more?
It would be so fine to see your face at my door
And it doesn't help to know you're just time away
Long ago I reached for you and there you stood
Holding you again would only do me good
Oh how I wish I could but you're so far away

One more song about moving along the highway
I can't say much of anything that's new
But if I could only work this life out my way
I'd rather spend it being close to you

But you're so far away
Doesn't anybody stay in one place any more?
It would be so fine to see your face at my door
And it doesn't  help to know you're so far away
So far away, yeah, you're so far away

Traveling around sure gets me down and lonely
Nothing else to do but close my mind
And I sure hope the road don't get to own me
There's so many dreams that I've yet to find

But you're so far away
Doesn't anybody stay in one place any more?
It would be so fine to see your face at my door
And it doesn't  help to know you're so far away
So far away, yeah, you're so far away",So Far Away,1996
Count Basic,"Give me your voice
Cause I'm too week
Lend me your tongue
For I cannot speak
Help me to say
What has to be heard
I need your help
To utter my words

Too much pain
I'm speechless
Too much to take
I'm speechless
Can't carry on
I'm speechless
Is there hope for me

A cry without voice
No tears in my eyes
Life without hope
Dispair bur no sighs
My hands are tied
I cannot move
Show me a future
To look into

Count Basic,"If I could do
What I want to
If I had you by my side
Baby you could feel
All my lovin'
If I showed you
That I want you

If I had the chance
Baby you would fall
For me too
All my life long
I've waited for this moment
Now that it's here
I don't have the guts to say

I'm loving you
I'm loving you now
If you would know
How I feel
If you could guess what's on my mind
Baby would you leave
Or would you stay
And if I told you

That I loved you
If I gave my heart to you tonight
Tell me would it matter
I'm yours if you want me too
All my life long
I've waited for my man
Now that you're here
I don't have the guts to say

There's no words to say that I want
You to stay
That I'm longing for your touch
Oh and how I pray you would be the
First to say
That you love me, that you need me
That you wantin' me as much",I'm Loving You,2000
Count Basic,"Many weeks have passed
Since we broke up and you left
No, you didn't break my heart apart
We just didn't give our best
What's good is gone,it's over now
You took it all and gave it up
Never thought about what we were losing
With you I was so sure
But now there ain't no cure
The rise and fall of love
Whatever it may take
I surely want you back
The rise and fall of love
Time and time again I asked myself
If you feel it the way I do
Are you missin' me like I miss you
Are you tryin' to be cool
I wonder why we couldn't make it
We could have been so good together
I just can't believe that it's all over",Rise & Fall,2000
Count Basic,"Do you hear
me When I'm talking to you
Are you listening to me
Can you see me 
When I'm passing you by 
Do you notice me at all
Do you consider a little 
The deeds that you do 
When you're heading for your goal 
Are you abusing or using 
The powers you hold 
Are you sure you're doing right
Someday
Your time will come to pay 
Mind what you do someday 
Will be returned some way 
Someday
Do you feel it
When you're hurting someone
Does it matter at all 
Can I trust you 
To decide what to do 
Are you honest with me",Someday,2000
Count Basic,"If I had a dollar for every time you lied
A penny for every time I cried 
A pillow to lay my head upon 
Strong arms to keep my body warm 
No one to harm me
And if I counted times you told me you would call 
Promises you made, I took it all
I gave love, oh yes I took the fall 
Where were you when I needed you the most
I was a fool to think 
I could be the richest woman in the world 

The richest woman in the world
(Be rich in love, be rich in life)
Money, sure don't make the man
Live life the best way you can
Respect me, and I will do the same 
There's so much we all have to gain
Live your life this way 
Truth will always be the key 
To happiness between you and me
The value of that should be enough
To last for all eternity 
Take heed to what I say",Richest Woman,2000
Count Basic,"From the cradle to the grave
Happiness is what we're searching for
But in fact all we gain
Is an endless chain of pain
Oh why, why don't we realize 
Throughout your lives you shed more tears 
Than there's water in the four oceans
In all those years your only chance
Is your faith, your love and devotion
Oh why, why don't we realize

On and on, right or wrong
The big wheel of life keeps on turning
What we do here and now
Will bear fruit in lives to come
Oh lord if only we came to see that
Just open your eyes and see
What's going on
And take the first step to be
Light and free
As free as you hoped to be",4 Oceans,2001
Count Basic,"Early morning
In paradise
Not a worry
Here to cloud my mind
Sun is shining on me bright
Keeps on lighting up my life
There's a gentle breeze that takes me on a fancy ride
Takes me where I want to stay for good
Feels like I'm falling in love
I'm falling in love with life
Feels like I'm falling in love
I'm falling in love with life
I don't want to come down
Up high
High I fly

My spirit's rising to the sky
No more ties to hold me down when I'm taking off the ground
Leaving all my doubts all my troubles way behind me
Takes me where I want to stay for good
I don't worry
Cause it's all behind me
Can you feel it
Cause it's all behind me
Taking off the ground you see
Would you like to come with me

And fall in love with life",In Love With Life,2001
Count Basic,"Messed up my life
Haven't done much good before
Wasting time was all I did
I never knew
Where to go, what to do
Just been a drifter, a drifter through time
I know I can make it
Just give me one more chance
Sure I don't deserve it

Give me one more chance
I'm sittin' here
Getting lost in thoughts again
Waiting for my life to change

You need a second go to find your way",One More Chance,2001
Count Basie,"I want a little girl, call my own.
She must be someone who's all alone now.
Say, I want a little girl 
To fall in love with me, oh yeah.

I want a little girl, but she may not look
Just like a picture in a story book.
If she can cook chicken, yeah, 
She'll suit me to a T.

And she don't have to wave her hair
Or even wear fancy clothes, 
I wouldn't even care.
She don't wear nylon hose, oh no.

I want a little girl 
To love a lot.
You know that I'd give 
Her everything I got.

Count Basie,"Listen to my tale of woe, 
It's terribly sad but true, 
All dressed up, no place to go 
Each evening I'm awfully blue. 

I must win some handsome guy 
Can't go on like this, 
I could blossom out I know, 
With somebody just like you. So

Oh, sweet and lovely lady, be good 
Oh, lady, be good to me 
I am so awfully misunderstood 
So lady, be good to me 
Oh, please have some pity 
I'm all-alone in this big city 
I tell you I'm just a lonesome babe in the wood, 
So lady be good to me. 

Oh, please have some pity

I tell you I'm just a lonesome babe in the wood, 
So lady be good to me. 
Oh lady be good to me.","Oh, Lady, Be Good",1962
Count Basie,"Never thought I'd fall, but when I hear you call
I'm getting sentimental over you
Things you say and do just thrill me through and through
I'm getting sentimental over you

I thought I was happy I could live without love
Now, I must admit, love is all I'm thinking of
Won't you please be kind, and just make up your mind
That you'll be sweet and gentle; be gentle with me
'Cause I'm getting sentimental over you",I'm Gettin' Sentimental Over You,

Count Basie,"We meet and the angels sing
The angels sing the sweetest song I've ever heard
You speak and the angels sing
Or am I reading music into every word?

Suddenly the setting is strange
I can see water and moonlight beaming
Silver waves that break on some undiscovered shore 
Then suddenly I see it all change
Long winter nights with the candles gleaming
Through it all your face that I adore

You smile and the angels sing
And though it's just a gentle murmur at the start
We kiss and the angels sing
And leave their music ringing in my heart",And the Angels Sing,
Count Basie,"Evening, every night you come and you find me
And you always remind me that my baby's gone
Evening, you got me deeply in your power
Every minute seems just like an hour, now that my baby's gone

Shadows fall upon the wall, that's the time I miss your kiss most of all
Even though I try, how can I go on

Oh evening, let me sleep till glow of dawn is breakin'
I don't care if I don't awaken, since my baby's gone

Shadows fall upon the wall, that's the time I miss your kiss most of all

Count Basie,"Love me or leave me and let me be lonely
You won't believe me that I love you only
I'd rather be lonely than happy with somebody else

Regretting instead of forgetting with somebody else
There'll be no else unless that someone is you, you, you

But I'm not gonna sit home and cry
Remember what goes up must come down
And, Baby, you've been flying too high

You ought to get your walkin' papers
But now it's too late
Because I know you too well
When you're through cuttin' capers
You break down my gate
To ring my front door bell

So go have your fling, and don't miss a thing
I'll see you down to earth by and by
Remember what goes up must come down
And, Baby, you've been flying too high",What Goes up Must Come Down,
Count Basie,"I was a stranger in the city
Out of town were the people I knew
I had that feeling of self-pity
What to do, what to do, what to do
The outlook was decidedly blue

But as I walked through the foggy streets alone
It turned out to be the luckiest day Ive known

A foggy day, in London town
Had me low, had me down
I viewed the morning, with much alarm
British Museum, had lost its charm

How long I wondered,
Could this thing last
But the age of miracles, hadn`t past
For suddenly, I saw you there
And through foggy London town,
The sun was shining everywhere

Of something that never happened, yet you recall it well
You know the feeling of recognizing someone
That you've never met as far as you could tell, well

Laura is the face in the misty light
Footsteps that you hear down the hall
The laugh that floats on a summer night
That you can never quite recall
And you see Laura on the train that is passing through
Those eyes, how familiar they seem
She gave your very first kiss to you
That was Laura but she's only a dream",Laura,

Exchanging glances
Wandering the night, 
What were the chances

Was so inviting
Something in your smile
Was so exciting
Something in my heart
Told me I must have you

Strangers in the night
Two lonely people
We were strangers in the night
Up to the moment 
When we said our first hello
Little did we know
Love was just a glance away
A warm embracing dance away

And ever since that night 
We've been together
Lovers at first sight
In love forever
It turned out so right

No, what is she sayin'?

COMMON? Man, I got class I ain't never used yet. I'm gonna knock again-
Richard's got to get up.
Open the door, Richard!! Man, you got a key to the house?
(No, ??, I don't have a key. I DON'T have a key.)
Somebody's got to get in the house. We can't climb in the transit.

Just because I'm, because I'm in misery
Oh, I don't beg, I don't beg for no sympathy

News is spreadin' 
'Bout our weddin'; 
I hear church bells ringin', 
Here's the song my heart keeps singin': 

Dinah, 
Is there anyone finer 
In the state of Carolina? 
If there is and you know her, 
Show her! 

Dinah, 
With her Dixie eyes blazin', 
How I love to sit and gaze in 
To the eyes of Dinah Lee! 

Yet, every night, 
My, how I shake with fright, 
Because my Dinah might, 
Change her mind about me! 

But if Dinah, 
Ever wandered to China, 
I would hop an ocean liner, 
Just to be with Dinah Lee!

Tragedy
Just seems to be the end of me

This is my last affair

Right from the start you took my love
Tore my heart apart
Now there's nothing new to look forward to
My dreams won't come true

So I'll make a vow
No more to love's shrine will I bow
I've crossed my heart and I'll seal it now
This is my last affair

Count Basie,"Walked with no one and talked with no one
And I had nothing but shadows

And I brightened at last

With the sun in my heart

When you taught me how to say

Grab your coat and get your hat
Leave your worry on the doorstep
Just direct your feet
To the sunny side of the street

And that happy tune is your step
Life can be so sweet
On the sunny side of the street

With those blues on parade

They will give you the world for a toy.
All I ask for these arms to enfold you, and a love, time can never destroy.

I've got the freedom in my soul

And it's four in the morning
My world is calling
Speeding through the universe tonight

The movie reminds of my lady
As she waits, ""Where are those guys?""
Yes, it's nice to see old Butch and Sundance in the sky

And now the sun is beginning to rise
It's like looking down on Paradise
There's a ball of fire that's burning
Giving life

And we are flying home
I feel the freedom in my soul

Count Basie,"Away from the city that hurts and knocks
I'm standing alone by the desolate docks
In the still and the chill of the night
I see the horizon, the great unknown

My heart has an ache
It's as heavy as stone
With the dawn coming on; make it last

I cover the waterfront
I'm watching the sea
Will the one I love
Be coming back to me?

Will you return?

Be coming back
To me?",I Cover the Waterfront,1979

All our plans and our all schemes
How could I think you'd be mine?
The lies I'd tell myself each time

I know that we could never last
We just can't seem to in the past
Just a dream I dream in vain
With you I'd only live in pain

Your picture is always with me
I can still hear that same mournful song
And now I sit here crying
Please, leave me alone

Why, why do I love you?
How can I live in misery?
I know that I won't forget you
But now I know it's too late for me",Just a Dream (On My Mind),1980
Count Basie,"When she wakes up this morning and turns to kiss me
She'll find I let her sleep cause we talked so late last night
She'll know I kissed her face gently till my returning
And when she finds the rose on my pillow I know she'll smile
Her amazing love unending is so much more than I am worthy of
If the rose could speak my feelings she'd know I cherished her amazing love

If I call her a little late she forgives me
Her voice does not betray she's spent another day alone
She softly thanks me for the rose and says I miss you
And then I can feel her smiling on the phone
Her amazing love",Amazing Love,1988

You know what I'm talking about,
Yes you do.
Well, if you've ever been to New York City,
You know what I'm talking about,
They got such pretty little girls in that big town,
Make a man wanna jump around and shout.

I met a little girl there,
She was about five foot eight.
I said ""I want you to love me.""
She said ""Why man, that'd be great.""
So,
I got long hair but,
She took me back,
Back to see her pad,
But the first thing I saw when I arrived there,
Was a big black shiny shotgun,
In the hands of her dad.

Alright now, this is how it was,
Oh no!

Well alright!

I finally learned my lesson,
Such a long time ago,
Next little woman that I date,
I've got to know, I've got to know her family too.

Am I too late to make amends?

True I've been seen with someone new

Reveal how I feel about you
Some kiss may cloud my memory
And other arms may hold a thrill
But please do nothin' till you hear it from me

Cast your line!

Oh! Will you never set me free?
The ties that bound us
Are still around us
There's no escape that I can see
And still those little things remain
That bring me happiness or pain

A cigarette that bears a lipstick's traces
An airline ticket to romantic places
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
A tinkling piano in the next apartment
Those stumbling words that told you what my heart meant
A fair ground's painted swings
These foolish things remind me of you
You came you saw you conquer'd me
When you did that to me
I knew somehow this had to be
The winds of March that make my heart a dancer
A telephone that rings but who's to answer?
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

First daffodils and long excited cables
And candle lights on little corner tables
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
The park at evening when the bell has sounded
The ""Ile de France"" with all the gulls around it
The beauty that is Spring's
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The sigh of midnight trains in empty stations
Silk stockings thrown aside dance invitations
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

Gardenia perfume ling'ring on a pillow
Wild strawb'ries only seven francs a kilo
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
The smile of Garbo and the scent of roses
The waiters whistling as the last bar closes
The song that Crosby sings
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The scent of smould'ring leaves, the wail of steamers
Two lovers on the street who walk like dreamers
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!

You can't explain it but you're one solid hurt
Baby, you've got growing pains

Your Christmas penny doesn't look half so bright
Papa's not president since maybe tonight
When you're not quite so sure that Mom's always right
Baby, you've got growing pains
Nothing's wrong, just growing pains
And they'll never hurt too long

When there are cobwebs in dreams that you weave
When there's no magic in the words 'Make believe'
When doubt comes peeping out and tugs at your sleeve
Baby, you've got growing pains

When you come home from school and don't slam the door
Ride down the banisters or slide 'cross the floor
When you don't cry for every toy in the store
Baby, you've got growing pains
They're not bad, just growing pains
You'll be awfully glad you had",Growing Pains,1989
Count Basie,"I guess I'll have to change my plan
I should have realized there'd be another man
I overlooked that point completely
Until the big affair began

Before I knew where I was at
I found myself upon the shelf and that was that
I tried to reach the moon but when I got there
All that I could get was the air

My feet are back upon the ground
I lost the one girl I'd found

I guess I'll have to change my plan
I should have realized there'd be another man
Why did I buy those blue pajamas
Before that big affair began?

My boiling point is much too low
For me to try to be a fly Lothario
I think I'll crawl right back and into my shell
Dwelling in my personal hell

I'll have to change my plan around
I lost the one girl I've found.

Yes the one girl I've found.",I Guess I'll Have to Change My Plans,1989
Count Basie,"I've grown accustomed to her face
She almost makes the day begin
I've grown accustomed to the tune
She whistles night and noon

Her smiles, her frowns
Her ups, her downs
Are second nature to me now
Like breathing out and breathing in

I was serenely independent and content before we met
Surely I could always be that way again and yet
I've grown accustomed to her look
Accustomed to her voice, accustomed to her face

I'm very grateful she's a woman and so easy to forget
Rather like a habit one can always break and yet
I've grown accustomed to the trace of something in the air
Accustomed to her face

Let's take our hearts, end it then in rhyme

Love's old refrain can never go wrong
Let's strike the note Mendelssohn wrote concerning spring weather

Count Basie,"Poor little rich girl,
You're a bewitched girl,
Better take care.
Laughing at danger,
Virtue a stranger,
Better beware!
The life you lead sets all your nerves a-jangle,
You love affairs are in a hopeless tangle,
Though you're a child, dear,
Your life's a wild typhoon!

In lives of leisure,
The craze for pleasure
Steadily grows;
Cocktails and laughter,
But what comes after?
Nobody knows!
You're weaving love into a mad jazz pattern,
Ruled by Pantaloon,
Poor little rich girl,
Don't drop a stitch too soon!

You're only a baby,
You're lonely, and maybe
Someday soon you'll know
The tears you are tasting
Are years you are wasting,
Life's a bitter foe!
With fate it's no use competing,
Youth is so terribly fleeting;
By dancing much faster
You're chancing disaster,
Time alone will show.

With plenty of money and you.
In spite of the worry that money brings.
Just a little filthy looker buys a lot of things.

And I could take you to places that you would like to go.

Good authors too who once knew better words 
Now only use four-letter words 
Writing prose. 
Anything goes.

If low bars you like, 
If old hymns you like, 
If bare limbs you like, 
If Mae West you like, 
Or me undressed you like, 
Why, nobody will oppose. 
When ev'ry night the set that's smart is in- 
Truding in nudist parties in 
Studios. 
Anything goes. 

When Missus Ned McLean (God bless her) 
Can get Russian reds to ""yes"" her, 
Then I suppose 
Anything goes. 
When Rockefeller still can hoard en- 
Ough money to let Max Gordon 
Produce his shows, 
Anything goes. 
The world has gone mad today 
And good's bad today, 
And black's white today, 
And day's night today, 
And that gent today 
You gave a cent today 
Once had several chateaux. 
When folks who still can ride in jitneys 
Find out Vanderbilts and Whitneys 
Lack baby clo'es, 
Anything goes. 

If Sam Goldwyn can with great conviction 
Instruct Anna Sten in diction, 
Then Anna shows

When you hear that Lady Mendl standing up 
Now turns a handspring landing up- 
On her toes, 
Anything goes.

And those knocks you've got 
And those blues you've got 
From that news you've got 
And those pains you've got

A sweet senorita
One night at a gala fiesta

I dig the Mamas and the Papas at ""The Trip,"" Sunset Strip in L.A.
And they got a good thing goin' when the words don't get in the way.
And when they're really wailing, Michelle and Cass are sailin'.
Hey! they really nail me to the wall.

I dig Donovan in a dream-like, tripped out way
His crystal images tell you 'bout a brighter day
And when the Beatles tell you
They've got a word ""love"" to sell you
They mean exactly what they say

I was out choppin' cotton and my brother was balin' hay
And at dinner time we stopped and walked back to the house to eat
And Mama hollered out the back door ""y'all remember to wipe your feet""
And then she said ""I got some news this mornin' from Choctaw Ridge""
""Today Billy Joe MacAllister jumped off the Tallahatchie Bridge""

'N' Papa said to Mama as he passed around the blackeyed peas
""Well Billy Joe never had a lick of sense, pass the biscuits, please""
""There's five more acres in the lower forty I've got to plow""
'N' Mama said it was shame about Billy Joe, anyhow
Seems like nothin' ever comes to no good up on Choctaw Ridge
And now Billy Joe MacAllister's jumped off the Tallahatchie Bridge

'N' Brother said he recollected when he and Tom and Billie Joe
Put a frog down my back at the Carroll County picture show
And wasn't I talkin' to him after church last Sunday night?
""I'll have another piece-a apple pie, you know it don't seem right""
""I saw him at the sawmill yesterday on Choctaw Ridge""
""And now ya tell me Billie Joe's jumped off the Tallahatchie Bridge""

'N' Mama said to me ""Child, what's happened to your appetite?""
""I've been cookin' all morning and you haven't touched a single bite""
""That nice young preacher, Brother Taylor, dropped by today""
""Said he'd be pleased to have dinner on Sunday, oh, by the way""
""He said he saw a girl that looked a lot like you up on Choctaw Ridge""
""And she and Billy Joe was throwing somethin' off the Tallahatchie Bridge""

A year has come 'n' gone since we heard the news 'bout Billy Joe
'N' Brother married Becky Thompson, they bought a store in Tupelo
There was a virus going 'round, Papa caught it and he died last Spring

And drop them into the muddy water off the Tallahatchie Bridge",Ode to Billie Joe,1999

And hangs around me all day. 
I'll have to sneak up to it 
Someday, and speak up to it.

But now you're doing wrong,
When you start to patter 
I'm so unhappy.

Swinging hard, Jack, I know I can't lose
When I tell you all about Mack the Knife, babe

In a little log hut we're all our own

Little brown jug, don't I love thee! 
Ha, ha, ha, you and me, 
Little brown jug, don't I love thee!

I take the little jug under my arm

Place it under a shady tree, 
Little brown jug, 'tis you and me. 
'Tis you that makes me friends and foes, 
'Tis you that makes me wear old clothes
But, seeing you're so near my nose, 
Tip her up and down she goes. 

If all the folks in Adam's race 
Were gathered together in one place, 
Then I'd prepare to shed a tear
(I'd let them go without a tear) 
Before I'd part from you, my dear. 

If I'd a cow that gave such milk, 
I'd dress her in the finest silk; 
Feed her up on oats and hay, 
And milk her twenty times a day. 

I bought a cow from Farmer Jones, 
And she was nothing but skin and bones
I fed her up as fine as silk, 
She jumped the fence and strained her milk. 

And when I die don't bury me at all, 
Just pickle my bones in alcohol
I'ut a bottle o' booze at my head and feet 
And then I know that I will keep.

I'm somewhere in another world, alone with you
Sharing all the joys we used to know
Many moons ago

Once again your face comes back to me
Just like the theme of some forgotten melody
In the album of my memory
Serenade in blue

It seems like only yesterday
The small cafe, a crowded floor
And as we danced the night away
I hear you say forever more
And then the song became a sigh
Forever more became goodbye
Cause you remained in my heart, but

Tell me darling in there still a spark?
Or only lonely ashes of the flame we knew
Should I go on whistling in the dark,
Serenade in blue",Serenade in Blue,2000
Count Basie,"And now the purple dusk of twilight time
Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb
Always reminding me that we're apart
You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms
The nightingale 
Tells his fairytale
Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain
My stardust melody
The memory of love's refrain.",Stardust,2000

You made me see how lovely life could be
Lifted up my heart and made me count the cost
To find I'd gained, not lost!

You showed me I was wrong
And you taught me how to carry on

Every night I dream a little dream
And of course Prince Charming is the theme
The he, for me.

Although I realize as well as you
It is seldom that a dream comes true
To me it's clear
That he'll appear

Some day he'll come along, the man I love
And he'll be big and strong, the man I love
And when he comes my way
I'll do my best to make him stay

He'll look at me and smile; I'll understand
And in a little while he'll take my hand
And though it seems absurd
I know we both won't say a word

Maybe I shall meet him Sunday
Maybe Monday, maybe not
Still I'm sure to meet him one day
Maybe Tuesday will be my good news day

From which I'll never roam; who would? Would you?

Just like a flivver.

Each morning I get up with the sun
Start a-hopping,
Never stopping -
To find at night no work has been done.

I know that
Once it didn't matter 
But now you're doing wrong;
When you start to patter
I'm so unhappy.

Won't you take a day off?
Decide to run along
Somewhere far away off 
And make it snappy!

No more doubt or fear, I found my way
For love came just in time

Count Basie,"Before Lord God made the sea and the land, 
He held all the stars in the palm of his hand. 
And they ran through his fingers like grains of sand, 
And one little star fell alone. 

Then the Lord God hunted through the wide night air
For the little dark star on the wind down there. 
And he stated and promised he'd take special care
So it wouldn't get lost again. 

Now a man don't mind if the stars grow dim
And the clouds blow over and darken him, 
So long as the Lord God's watching over them, 
Keeping track of how it all goes on.

But I've been walking all the night and the day, 
Till my eyes get weary and my head turns gray.
And sometimes it seems maybe God's gone away,
And we're lost out here in the stars.

Little stars, big stars, blowing through the night,
And we're lost out here in the stars.

And we're lost out here in the stars.",Lost in the Stars,2008
Count Basie,"When I fall in love it will be forever
Or I'll never fall in love

In a restless world like this is

Seem to cool in the warmth of the sun

Or I'll never, never give my heart

And the moment I can feel that you feel that way too
Is when I fall in love with you",When I Fall in Love,2008

Those trees, that breeze, 
They're part of the tender trap

Some starry night, when her kisses make you tingle
She'll hold you tight, and you'll hate yourself for being single

He held all the stars in the palm of his hand. 
And they ran through his fingers like grains of sand, 
And one little star fell alone. 

Then the Lord God hunted through the wide night air
For the little dark star on the wind down there. 
And he stated and promised he'd take special care
So it wouldn't get lost again. 

Now a man don't mind if the stars grow dim
And the clouds blow over and darken him, 
So long as the Lord God's watching over them, 
Keeping track of how it all goes on.

But I've been walking all the night and the day, 
Till my eyes get weary and my head turns gray.
And sometimes it seems maybe God's gone away,
And we're lost out here in the stars.
