"Owen ""Boomer"" Castleman","I've got nothing to say
I've got building block for teeth
And a tube sock, for a tongue

I can't do anything 
I can't do my hair right
Or have a good time
Or fall asleep, 
With my girl

If you don't wanna see
The worst in me
You've got two choices: 
Cover your eyes, 
Both hands tight
Or, just leave

I don't know what I think
I'm unsure
That I could or couldn't 
Care, less or more
About everyone 
I do or don't know 

If you don't wanna be
With a dead beat like me
I won't blame you
I won't blame you
I won't blame you

If you don't wanna see
The worst in me
You've got two choices
Cover your eyes
Both hands tight
Or just leave.",Declaration of Incompetence,2001
"Owen ""Boomer"" Castleman","I've a picture of you--
A parisian street, early morning, late spring.
And I know what you were thinking.
You were taking a break from life. you were traveleing light
(a pair of walking shoes and a sweater).
You were where you were when you pictured where you'd be--
Anywhere but home.
Well it's you last chance to change things.
I know you've been getting by alright,
And alright's okay for the day to day, but for the rest of your life?
An honest face like that,
You just can't take back that easy.
An honest face like that,
I just can't forget too easy.
(god knows I'm trying...)

"Owen ""Boomer"" Castleman","A head that aches doesn't have to stay that way, just let what's dead go. I know there's pain in leaving things all too well. In time, you'll find needing things only kills you slowly. If you're not sure who you are, you're not alone. If you're not sure what you want, you're not alone. If you're not sure of life of love (?), you're not alone. Tell your friends, hey come on over and talk. You bring the drinks, I'll bring the bad mood. Everyone feels like you. Tell your dad to come on over and we'll talk, you bring your drinks, I'll bring the fuck you's. Long awaited, long overdue. Tell your ex-girlfriend you need her to be there at bedtime. Cause you can't sleep your minds on all these things. Bring out what's dead and dying (something) while you still can.",Everyone Feels Like You,2002
"Owen ""Boomer"" Castleman","Who's going the right way down a wrong way street? Who's making a mistake each time our mouths meet? You're smart and kind and easy on my eyes. I know it feels good, that's why we shouldn't tonight. Who's waiting for answers from a boy who can't speak? Will be holding their breath until their blue in the cheeks. You're smart and kind and you're too easy on my eyes. I know it feels good, so good, we should tonight. Cause maybe my mom's right, good deeds won't save us, just true faith in Jesus. So in the name of her lord lets do what we shouldn't some more.",Good Deeds,2002
"Owen ""Boomer"" Castleman","I'm not going anywhere tonight, because of something said. I know, I know, it was meant well, but it still hurt like hell. Its OK, its alright its just that I'm a little tired of fading interest, of boys and girls. You know me and, you know me and I wanna say, I'm gonna say, I'm not the same, maybe in time. I'm not making promises in life cause of something I did tonight. My best friend, that was way back when. Not anything was everything then. I know it's not fair to the fairest of them all (you know who you are). I've got your picture on a mirror on my wall. I know you and, I know you and, but you wanna say in the worst of ways that I'm afraid and maybe too late. I'm not going anywhere tonight cause I don't want to, I don't have to. It's my right to be a fucking baby sometimes.",I'm Not Going Anywhere Tonight,2002
"Owen ""Boomer"" Castleman","Go on, get out of here. You've got everything you came for. Warm arms, a warm bed to fall into when you can't get what you did out of your head. Go on. You've made yourself clear. You're no good for no one now. You put your selfish hands and your selfish tongue on my body, but we both know who your mind's on. I know you're still dealing with her leaving. It's a shame, but you've only yourself to blame. Go on. See if I care. Do whatever the fuck you want to. I'll do the same, alright? OK. There's no need to apologize for selling what you advertised. I know that you're dealing with her leaving. It's a shame, but you've only yourself to blame. You're grieving for good reason she was great, but you've only yourself to blame. You're still dealing with her leaving, it's a shame, but you've only yourself to blame. You're bleeding internally and you're in pain, but you've only yourself to blame. So grab your things and go on, get out of here. I never asked to be nobody's nothing.",Nobody's Nothing,2002
"Owen ""Boomer"" Castleman","Long night 
Last call
Bloodshot eyes from some drinks too tall
Breathe in deep and I swear to god I'll die 
If I go home alone tonight.

I raise my head slow hoping to find 
A girl I don't know,
Who wouldn't mind showing a good time,
To feeling alright with 
Doing something we might 
Regret in the morning.

You, in a cardigan, 
You're tired of all your friends.
You, in love with the cock-toed twins, 
You're bored with your boyfriend.

I want to be with you tonight, 
With our legs crossed, our tongues tied.

Wants to drive me home?

If I go home alone tonight.",Poor Souls,2002
"Owen ""Boomer"" Castleman","I spend most days in this bed that I abuse,
On these pillows that you can't get used to.
I spend entire days putting off that which can't wait
Until I'm knee deep in my own waste.

And I think that I'm justified 'cause I've seen what trying's done for those who've tried.

I spend most days in this bed too small for two,
Misplacing time like I've got it to lose.
I spend endless days thinking of all the different ways that we make love.

And I think that I'm justified 'cause I've seen what living's done for those alive.
(little to none, little to none)

I spend entire days in this bed too small for two,
On these pillows that you can't get used to.
And that's why I don't sleep at night

It's more me than you.",Bed Abuse,2004
"Owen ""Boomer"" Castleman","You go and I'll stay. Why would I put clothes on to see some guy you like more than me? But you should go and I'll be ok. I promised myself I'd finally start that book I've been meaning to read about the French Revolution.

You go and I'll stay. Why would I leave the house to go see some guy who sings better than me? And you come home to me smelling like booze, humming his tunes. I'm rolling over and it's lights out for this lightweight.",Lights Out,2004
"Owen ""Boomer"" Castleman","Put your faith in me my friends. 
That one day I'll find a way 
to give all the things that you've given to me back. 

Well, put your foot down my brother. 
That's no way to live putting the needs of others ahead of yours. 
You deserve more than nothing.

It's the little things that we do that mean anything. 

Put your hands on me my love, 
While the world wakes up early and wastes the day 
Working for money they don't need, 
to buy ting they don't need. 
We'll sleep in, We'll do it again.

It's the little things that we do that mean anything.","Put Your Hands on Me, My Love",2004
"Owen ""Boomer"" Castleman","You put on your raincoat
'Cause it looks like it just might today
And you grab your keys
You're out the door
Before you know where you're going.

If blame, as they say, is for god and little kids
Then you're deserving of praise or a slap on the wrist
'Cause you can't help but blame yourself
For your long face

Not a day passes that you don't fold your hands
And ask St. Francis to find the lust for life
That you lost when she left
With your tongue and your last breath

Not a day passes that you don't close your eyes
And ask St. Francis to find the love of your life

Or what you'll need
Or where you're going.",She's a Thief,2004

You won't say, like you don't say anything anyone can hold you to. I hope I don't make the same foolish mistakes I know you've made because I can see me in the things that you don't say, people that you don't see.

Tell me again where you were when (where you were...) the world changed and forgot about you. If it's sympathy you need then I'm sorry but you're not the only one who feels cheated. It's too close to home and it's too near the bone, more than you'll ever know...

But your decisions of late are on all accounts
Pretty fucked up
And not in a good way

Kicking yourself to sleep

Oh, and who pulled who's hair on who's head

Best friends, better halves
Goodbyes, and the other night, we realized,
We were falling out of love
There were some things, that were said, that weren't meant
They never did

I just think its best
Cause you can't miss what you forget
So lets just pretend
Everything and anything
Between you and me
Was never meant

I tip him well and I drink for free

He takes good care of me
He takes care of me
Anyway I'm here
I'm a bicycle

I'm too tired to ride home
If it's okay with you
Can I take off these shoes?
And stay the night

Just between
You and me
This thing between you and me
Might not be anything worth singing about
Or it might be just what I need

At the end of a long day

At the end of a long night

Your head shakes and you think ""never again."" It's true what they say about fools who leave too soon, they don't ever really move on. Put your hand in your bag and pull out the Carver book you grabbed before leaving. And then you realize in this too she was right. You make an excuse, you make up a lie. So what's left of your soul like the best friend you just sold to sleep? Easy at night. It's true what they say about fools who speak too soon, they don't ever really know what they're getting into or out of. You're on your way, the taste of blood from a bitten tongue.

New Order & Morrissey
But you already know that because you used to ride with me

I thought I'd be singing a different tune by now
But the song about you keeps coming out

I sleep in these dirty sheets
A blanket between my bony knees
But you already know that because you used to crawl in bed with me the morning before work

Put your hands on my back
Kiss the back of my neck

I thought I'd be singing a different tune by now

I have my doubts that you kiss your mother with that mouth. 
You put it on me. 
Up and down me.

Now that we're friends, 
It's becoming more and more clear 
That your vampire boyfriend isn't going anywhere.

You aren't:
A good friend, unique, well-read
Good-looking, or smart
Well now you know

well I hate to be the one to bear such bad news
I know it hurts to hear
But it's true
You don't mean anything
To anyone but me
And even I think
That you're blinded by conceit
So now you know

free beer
And basement shows
Don't mean you've made it
It's what you do
Not who you were, what you wear, where you've been
So do something

whoever you think is watching you dance
From across the room
They aren't
If anything, they feel sorry for you
'cause you try so hard

I know it hurts to hear
But it's the truth
So you might as well hear it
From a friend
You're a has-been
That never was
I know it's mean to say
But it's something I've been meaning to say to you
For a while
You're a has-been
That never was

Like holidays at home
Continue to remind you
Of who you were
And who you are

The spines creased and worn
All signs of being adored
And those words somehow meant more to you
Than who they were written for

those blankets in your bed
So tattered and sad
They've seen enough sleepless nights
Both good and bad
To pen a short story
Use your words
For a few love songs
Well ain't it about time
You've moved on

those books that you've read
You will read again
After enough time passes
You'll remember some names
But not how they end
After enough time passes

I won't stray too far, or be gone too long

windows and doorways, I don't know which way
To leave this room because I'm afraid of heights
And I'm afraid of you tonight
Those striped socks and punk rock pajamas
Some ways I changed, in most ways I'm the same

for better or worse I can't say
Only time will tell
Like an addict, I'm cursed in a good way
I've done it so long and I'm not sure how not to

Where dangers silently creep
And storms so violently sweep
You're drifting to far from the shore

Drifting too far from the shore (from the shore)
Drifting too far from the shore (peaceful shore)
Come to Jesus today, let him show you the way
You're drifting to far from the shore

Today the tempest rolls high
And clouds overshadow the sky
Sure death is hovering nigh
You're drifting to far from the shore

Why meet a terrible fate
Mercy abundantly waits
Turn back before its to late

If only little darling I could be by your side
Tho' it breaks my heart to hear your name
Soon the wild flowers will bloom again in the spring

And of all the pretty flowers sent here from above
Oh maybe I'll see her in Heaven someday
And pick pretty flowers as we go on our way

And let all of our sins be forgiven

Owen Bradley,"Hear that lonesome whippoorwill
He sounds too blue to fly
The midnight train is whining low
I'm so lonesome I could cry

I've never seen a night so long
When time goes crawling by
The moon just went behind the clouds
To hide its face and cry

Did you ever see a robin weep
When leaves begin to die
That mean's he's lost his will to live
I'm so lonesome I could cry

Lights up a purple sky

For my sweetheart she is gone
The road is rough and filled with gravel
But I must journey on and on

To me she was a little angel
Sent down to me from God above
And on the day that I first met her
Then I told her of my love

Many a night we strolled together
Talking of our love so fair
My love for her will never vanish
Oh I know I'll meet her there

Knowing soon we'll be together

There I met a mountain maid with eyes of blue
Golden hair so soft and curly and her lips were like the dew
She was the queen of West Virginia and her name was Linda Lou

Linda Lou my Linda Lou can't you hear me calling you
Calling like a lonesome dove my Linda Lou
When the moon is in the blue and the stars are shining too
Can't you hear my lonely heart calling for you Linda Lou

I recall the night I met her how I held her hand in mine
I recall the night we kissed and bid adieu
Many miles may separate us if I should cross the ocean blue
My heart is still in West Virginia with my darling Linda Lou",Linda Lou,1991
Owen Bradley,"What will the birds do, mother, in the spring
Will they gather the crumbs around our door
Will they fly from the nest to the top of the tree
And ask why Joe wanders out no more

What will the kitten do, mother, all alone
Will she stray from her frolic for a day
Will she lie on the rug beside my bed 
Like she did before I went away

What will Thomas, the old gardener do 
When you ask him for flowers for me
Will he give you a rose he has tended with care
The fairest one that lies around the tree

I saw the tears coming to his honest eyes
He said it was the wind that brought 'em there
As he gazed on my cheeks growing paler each day
His hand trembled over my hair

Keep Tag, mother, my little dog 
I know that he'll mourn for me too
Keep him though blind and older he grows
To sleep in the whole summer through

Show him my coat, mother, so he may know
That his master then will be dead
Speak to him kindly and often of Joe
And pat him on his brown shaggy head

And you, dearest mother, shall miss me for a while
But in heaven I shall no larger grow
And any kind angel you meet at the gate
Can take you to your darling Little Joe",Little Joe,1991

Gone like the flowers in the fall
You crossed your heart, now you're double crossing mine
You've been pretending after all

I was sold down the river to a port of broken dreams
Drifting in sorrow down the stream
Sold down the river on a ship that won't return
When it anchors in the sea of broken dreams

I never dreamed that your love would grow so cold
Hiding behind the rainbow's end
You must be blind for the glitter of the gold
Gold that can never find a friend

I was sold down the river on the port of broken dreams
Drifting in sorrow down the stream
Sold down the river on a ship that won't return
When it anchors in the sea of broken dreams

You'll never know what it means to sit and cry
After your heart is broken too
Someday you'll learn and your soul will burn and die
When some one double crosses you

Drifting in sorrow down the stream
Sold down the river on a ship that won't return
When it anchors in the sea of broken dreams

Until she had to go away

Didn't I represent you?

So let me get the keys to Lex and then my checks

Bright eyes and subtle variations of blue
Everywhere is balanced there like a rainbow above you

Street lights glisten on the boulevard
And cold nights make staying alert so hard
For heaven's sake, keep me awake so I won't be caught off guard
Clearly I am a passerby but I'll find a place to stay
Dear pacific day, won't you take me away?

Small town hearts of the New Year
Brought down by gravity, crystal clear
City fog and brave dialogue converge on the frontier

Make haste, I feel your heartbeat
With new taste for speed, out on the street
Find a road to a humble abode where both of our routes meet
The silver sound is all around and the colors fall like snow
The feeling of letting go, I guess we'll never know

Cheer up and dry your damp eyes and tell me when it rains
And I'll blend up that rainbow above you and shoot it through your veins
Cause your heart has a lack of color and we should've known
That we'd grow up sooner or later cause we wasted all our free time alone

Your nerves gather with the altitude
Exhale the stress so you don't come unglued
Somewhere there is a happy affair, a ghost of a good mood
Wide eyed, panic on the getaway
The high tide could take me so far away
VCR's and motorcars unite on the Seventh Day
A popular gauge will measure the rage of the new Post-Modern Age
Cause somewhere along the line all the decades align

We were the crashing whitecaps
On the ocean
And what lovely seaside holiday, away
A palm tree in Christmas lights
My emotion
Struck a sparkling tone like a xylophone
As we spent the day alone

Cheer up and dry your damp eyes and tell me when it rains
And I'll blend up that rainbow above you and shoot it through your veins

Walking down by the bay
On the shore, staring up at the planes

I drew my over shirt
Around my arms and began
To shiver violently before

And see the tunnels all around me
Running into the dark

So tell me darling do you wish we'd fall in love?
All the time, all the time

Can you believe that the crew has gone
And wouldn't let me sign on?
All my islands have sunk
In the deep, so I can hardly relax
Or even oversleep
I feel as if I were home, some nights
When we count all the ship lights
I guess I'll never know
Why sparrows love the snow
We'll turn off all of the lights
And set this ballroom aglow

Comb the beach and put those blue flowers up in your ponytail

Inside my head your voice is still resounding but what can I do?

Count the stars, watch the waves, absorb the summer sun and think of me
When you explore hidden coves and tiny island chains throughout the sea
Can you still hear my voice when I?m outside from over the phone?

'Cause all I see is a shattered conscience staring right back at me
I wish I had covered all my tracks completely
'Cause I'm so afraid, is that the light at the far end of the tunnel or just the train
Lift your arms, only heaven knows where the danger grows
And it's safe to say there's a bright light up ahead and help is on the way

I forget the last time I felt brave, I just recall insecurity
'Cause it came down like a tidal wave and sorrow swept over me

Depression please cut to the chase and cut a long story short
Oh please be done, how much longer can this drama afford to run
Fate looks sharp, severs all my ties and breaks whatever doesn't bend
But sadly then, all my heavy hopes just pull me back down again

I forget the last time I felt brave, I just recall insecurity
'Cause it came down like a tidal wave and sorrow swept over me
Then I was given grace and love
I was blind but now I can see
'Cause I've found a new hope from above
And courage swept over me

It hurts just to wake up whenever you're wearing thin

Inertia must be a con

I could skate from Maine to Nebraska

A strawberry avalanche crashed over me

Staying awake that night was rather hard
Deep in a sleeping bag in your backyard
When we woke up buried alive
Beneath a fruity landslide
We both laughed hysterically
It could have been just another dream
But I swear I heard you scream
A strawberry avalanche crashed over me

Always a citrus constellation in the galaxy
Scratched on the back of both my eyelids
And I've been dying to see
If you were a beautiful sound
In the echoes all around

Touch your feathers to the breeze
And leave the ground

Birds-eye view, awake the stars 'cause they're all around you
Wide eyes will always brighten the blue
Chase your dreams, and remember me, sweet bravery
'Cause after all those wings will take you, up so high
So bid the forest floor goodbye as you race the wind
And take to the sky

Owl City,"The first Noel the angels did say
Was to certain poor shepherds
In fields as they lay,
In fields where they lay
Keeping their sheep
On a cold winter's night
That was so deep.
Noel Noel Noel Noel!
Born is the King of Israel!

They looked up and saw a star
Shining in the East beyond them far,
And to the earth it gave great light,
And so it continued both day and night.
Noel Noel Noel Noel!
Born is the King of Israel!

And by the light of that same star
Three wise men came from country far,
To seek for a King was their intent
And to follow the star
Wherever it went.

Owl City,"Symphony of silver tears,
Sing to me and sooth the ring in my ears,
Overcast these gloomy nights wear on,
But I'm holding fast because it's darkest just before the dawn.

I sang my princess fast asleep,
'Cause she was my dream come true,
Oh Annmarie, believe me, I loved you.

But now those lonely lullabies,
Just dampen my tired eyes,
Because I can't forget you.
Because I can't forget you.

I'll dissolve when the rain pours in,
When the nightmares take me,
I will scream with the howling wind,
'Cause it's a bitter world and I'd rather dream.

Dizzy love turned a star lily pink,
And hung above our lids too flushed to blink,
But icy blue froze the fairytale cold,
Though I treasured you and you sparkled with someone to hold.

I sang my princess fast asleep,
'Cause she was my dream come true,
Oh Annmarie, believe me, I loved you.

Beneath the sand
The white windy waves washed in
But I stayed dry
The great breakers broke again
'Cause I'm on and off inside

I could finally crash again
And that's how I became the sea
I wrenched the engines off
And dragged them down

As they swiftly drowned
And I brought the ocean side
To its rusty knees

There was a hole in my heart

And restoring life to the lighthouse
A slow motion wave on the ocean
Stirs my emotion up like like a rain cloud

When did the sky turn black?
And when will the light come back?

Then to survivor,
Dying to breakdown
A blood brother, surrogate mother,
Hugging each other, crying their eyes out

Locked in the attic
Strung out and spellbound

Leaving my healing heart with a new scar
A dead fire rose and rose higher
Like a vampire, up from the graveyard

Just to discover life where we all are

Was climbing up the stairs

Was like, I just wanna know your name

And written on it were the words

Out there in the great Lake Superior
Right across the bay

It was all a blur, but there we were

Madeline Island

We left our shadows on the lake shore
We soaked up all the sights
About drowned in a downpour
But for the northern lights

We shot the breeze under pine trees
And sat around the fire
We hit the hay beneath the Milky Way
And there we were

Owl City,"A fifteen year old kid from Saint Paul
Hopped on a train and headed west
Got a job at a Saint Mary restaurant
Washing dishes and making friends

The years went by like the seasons
And they brought him a lifetime of joy
He bought ten or twelve acres of heaven
With a paradise vanish point
And he built a cabin at the foot of the mountains
That stole his heart when he was a boy

On North Fork Road you're almost home

Get lost in Montana
Where your heart can finally roam
Get lost in Montana
Where the mountains call you home
Get lost forever in Montana

His son worked hard in West Glacier
His daughter sold souvineers
And he always went back to Polebridge
With his family every year

To his green tin roof in the Rockies
And a sky so full of stars
His spirit lives in these mountians
Where Montana first stole his heart

On North Fork Road you're almost home

Get lost in Montana
Where your heart can finally roam
Get lost in Montana
Where the mountains call you home
Get lost forever in Montana

Two words on a bumper sticker
Were all I needed to read
I found myself for the first time
When Montana enchanted me

So get lost in the Big Sky country
Where adventure calls your name
Every moment is worth more than diamonds
When you spend time in the treasure state

So get lost in the Big Sky country
And let your heart lead the way",Montana,2018

I'll never find the words, my love
To tell you how I feel, my love
Mere words could not explain
Precious love
You held my life within your hands
Created everything I am
Taught me how to live again

Only you
Cared when I needed a friend
Believed in me through thick and thin
This song is for you
Filled with gratitude and love

God bless you
You make me feel brand new
For God blessed me with you
You make me feel brand new
I sing this song 'cause you
Make me feel brand new

My love
Whenever I was insecure
You built me up and made me sure
You gave my pride back to me
Precious friend
With you I'll always have a friend
You're someone who I can depend
To walk a path that never ends

Without you
My life has no meaning or rhyme
Like notes to a song out of time
How can I repay
You for having faith in me",You Make Me Feel Brand New,2004
Owsley,"Take me back in time
To the day I was your valentine
No halo over your head
We stayed at home and spent the day in bed

Your skin so hot to the touch
I never wanted anyone so much
Your a sight for sore eyes to see
Won't somebody come and rescue me

I've spent along time away
And it's good to be home
And together is better than being alone
It's a far cry from anything I've ever felt like before

Yes and long is the road
That's been leading me back to your door
A daydream out of the blue
Into something so sad but true

An old friend back from the dead
To steal the covers sleeping in your bed
I never meant to be an aggravation
I'm only looking for a second chance

I'm so hard-headed that determination
Left me all alone
That's why I'm coming home
Running all the way",Homecoming Song,1998
Owsley,"Love is a friend of mine
It tells me to keep my head
When all those around me are
Losing theirs instead

You know me well
I do it all on my own
I wanted to turn around
And make my house a home

For the king and the queen
(And live in never, neverland)
I know they're waiting for me
(But the hourglass is out of sand)

To be the class clown
When I was a younger man
Got used to taking it on the chin
I fight when I'm falling down

Get back up again
The time has come
To put away childish things
And fly like a mockingbird

Angels spread their wings
You're wearing the frown
Feeling so down
And still, you paint the town red

You're waking the dead
Making you bed to lie next to me
There's a place to go when I'm feelin' low
That nobody else will ever know

When you're on the ropes in the final round
That's how it feels to be the class clown
Will it ever go away?",Class Clown,1999
Owsley,"Morning comes and you're so lonely
And you feel like you're the only one alive
Since she left you blame yourself
For all the things she never felt

How could you be untrue to yourself
When nobody is watching
Your life isn't over the clock is still tocking
One day you will wake up and you'll

Be able to forget the sadness
Get into the gladness
Of love and it's way and you will not fight it
While everyone dozes, you're coming up roses

Drowning in a sea of sorrow
She won't be here for tomorrow's lullaby
'Round and 'round and 'round she goes
And where she stops nobody knows

But God above
It's starting to rain and you're running
For cover like she ran to the arms of another
One day you will wake up and you'll

Be able to forget the sadness
Get into the gladness
Of love and it's way and you will not fight it
While everyone dozes, you're coming up roses

You will learn to try again
When you get your second wind
How long is the road paved with good intentions
Forever waiting divine intervention

Of love and it's way and you will not fight it
While everyone dozes, you're coming up roses",Coming Up Roses,1999
Owsley,"I went back home the other day
To see some old friends that I used to know
It was strange to see that all has changed
Just like me my hometown had to grow

On lazy Sunday afternoons
We used to drive around the neighborhood
But as I looked around I see
Nothing really looks the way it should

There's a parking lot where the church used to be
And the old town drunk changed his ways
Still my mind goes wandering down memory lane
Looking out for the good old days

My high school sweetheart's married off
With two kids and another on the way
And the coach I hardly recognized
His thick black hair has slowly turned to grey

All the debutantes and the homecoming queens
Have taken kids on to raise
Still my mind goes wandering down memory lane
Looking out for the good old days

When I find myself romancing now
The way that it used to be
I can't help thinking someday
That it's coming back to me
And I never was the kind
To see the forest forming trees

Looking back on yesterday
Never was my favorite thing to do
But that's okay it's just as well
It seems there's less to hold on to

There's a parking lot where the church used to be
And the old town drunk changed his ways
Still my mind goes wandering down memory lane
Well I hope it's a passing phase
Oh yeah
Looking back at the good old days",Good Old Days,1999
Owsley,"I don't care what you say
Nothing's gonna change me anyway
I don't care what you say about me
Look inside what you see

Ain't the kind of man I want to be
Look inside and what you see is not me
I'm alright, you won't break me
I'm not a slave to conventional ways

I'm alright, you won't shake me
Time left a mark here that you can't erase
People come, people go
Is it sincere or just a show
People come, people go, you don't know",I'm Alright,1999
Owsley,"Waiting for someone to finish the story
Of a heart that's been broken and thrown on the floor
Picking up pieces to put back together
Hoping it beats like before
It's all between you
And it's all between me
But in-between the lines what could it mean
When you say what you mean
Do ya mean what ya say
Am I the sentimental favorite of the day?
I am the coat that you keep in your closet
That you pull up around you whenever it's cold
It's not the weather that keeps us together
It's the warmth of my hand that you hold
(Tell me baby what you see is it me?)
Are you looking for tenderness?
(Said the sentimental favorite of the day)
Please be sincere, my dear, with me
Can I solve your mystery?",Sentimental Favorite,1999
Owsley,"Just when I thought it was safe outside
The newscaster's calling for rain
And if I listen to him
The sky is falling from every limb

Chicken Little had a big day today
When the time runs out
And the clock winds down
And the rooster crows

The sky is falling on my head
(Tumbling down, tumbling down)
The sky is falling on me
Who tried to fool Mother Nature

Well, I don't think she looks too amused
And now it's starting to rain
I think we know who deserves the blame
Everybody gets a little judgment day

I know what to do
I should write a book about it
I can just see it now
And the pages are wet

Well, I guess I should get an umbrella
The kind that can stop more than rain
Yeah, I'm always in a hard hat zone",The Sky Is Falling,1999
Owsley,"Take Sonny, he's a real go-getter
A regular man about town
He's got the world revolving around the music
And keeping his ear to the ground

He falls asleep behind his dark sunglasses
And whispers the words with a smile
D-I-double-G, I love ya, baby
I ain't seen your face in awhile

She ain't keeping score, he don't owe her anything
But she ain't gonna sit around
Waiting for the phone to ring
Sonny Boy, don't take your toys away

Save them for a rainy day, yea, yea, yea
An IOU could break her heart in two
She thought you were the real McCoy, Sonny Boy
He's got his servant and his own dumbwaiter

To answer the phone when you call
Sorry, Sonny's underneath the weather
Try him back later next fall
The boss called him out to California

Let Hollywood make you a star
Now he's on the Music Television
And driving a Cadillac car
Funny how fame and money does what it can

To bring about change in the boy
The clothes don't make the man

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
It's a game you just can't win
Though it never will be the same again
Fair-weather friend
I don't think we've heard the last of Sonny
He can't get it off of his mind
He wants to laugh, but he don't think it's funny
A conscience can turn on a dime
When he was a boy, they taught him the Golden Rule
Take him for anything, but don't take him for a fool

[Chorus]

Owsley,"When nothing I feel like
Is going my way
And me and my good thing
Got no place to stay
I pack up the Chevy
And we roll out of town
To a little piece of country heaven
Where we turn it up to eleven

Uncle John's farm is a place we can go
Where no one will stand in our way
And you'll love Aunt Colene
And her peaches and cream
It'll give us a shot in the arm
Down at our Uncle John's farm

Rock on the porch swing
By the light of the moon
And drink lemonade
On a hot afternoon
Roll on the river
Or have a roll in the hay

Thank you Lord, may I have another?

Uncle John's farm is a place we can go
Where no one will stand in our way
And the grass is so green in a city boy's dream
We can sleep all alone in the barn together
Down at my Uncle John's farm

Forgot to tell you about the geese and chickens
I know you thought that they were finger lickin'
But out here they move
Uncle John is gonna sing a song

I'm so glad we had this time together

Owsley,"There's a house down on the corner
That we always used to talk about
Never had the guts to go inside
Not even on a dare

Scary eyes looked out upon a sleepy town
Fascination kept us guessin'
Why the sign read to Beware

We always knew just what would hit the fan
If we got an up-close look at the boogieman
Shadows on the wall
Voices in the hall

There's more than just a mouse
In the Zavelow house
I could look inside the window
If I jumped upon my trampoline

Coulda sworn I saw Hannibal Lechter
With a hatchet and a head
Not the kind of place

And take it into the center of my soul
I wanna run through the fields of your imagination

Under the blue skies, you're the golden sun
I look in your eyes and know you are the one
See where my heart lies, trippin' on the fascination

Along the way
I will hang on every single word you say
And should you whisper asking me to stay
Maybe I'll, lay a while to kiss your smile

I wanna know how it feels to believe in something
Ride on the heels of a good thing coming
Run to the one thing I know is something true
I wanna be with you, yeah

Want you to show me, the wonders of the world
Feel like you know me like no other girl
You have and hold me, leading me out of the darkest night

I'm a peaceful man
But just until something this evil comes to me
I'll do everything that I can
You will never know
What I mean
When I say
I'm a fighting machine
I feel my spirit is rising
I was raised by a priest
I won't sell my soul to the
Darkness around me
I will fight the beast
I'm a mean clean fighting machine
I won't stop 'til I'm done
Mean clean fighting machine
I will be number one
And if the others will be fallin'
I am the one to stand
'Cause I'm a mean clean fighting machine (That's right)
And I will fight until the end

Oxmo Puccino,"T'es comme une bougie
Qu'on a oublié d'éteindre dans une chambre vide
Tu brilles entouré de gens sombres voulant te souffler
Celui qui a le moins de jouets
Le moins de chouchous
Celui qu'on fait chier
Le cœur meurtri et meurtrière est ta jalousie
L'enfant seul se méfie de tout le monde, pas par choix
Mais dépit, pense qu'en guise d'ami
Son ombre suffit
Une solitude qui te suit jusque dans le sexe
Mon texte coupe l'enfant seul en deux espèces
Ceux qui baisent à l'excès mais souhaiteraient se
Fixer à une femme plutôt qu'à mille fesses
Quand l'autre sorte écoute souvent la même
Chanson dans le poste, et porte le deuil d'une
Relation morte et reste l’œil humide
La tête baissée laisse le cœur sur l'estomac
L'estomac sur les genoux, ma tristesse n'a d'égale
Que le coup de gueule muet de l'enfant seul
Que nul ne calcule

T'es l'enfant seul (je sais que c'est toi)
Viens-tu des bas-fonds
Ou des quartiers neufs?
Bref, au fond tous la même souffrance

Mes mots s'emboîtent les gens s'y voient comme dans une flaque d'eau
Ça leur renvoie un triste reflet, mais est-ce ma faute?
T'es l'enfant seul c'est pas facile, on se comprend
Peu le savent
Que je le sache ça te surprend
Il mate par la vitre la solitude qui le mine
Fait passer la quinine pour un sucre
Faut être lucide, il faut qu'on se libère, disent-ils
Ils n'en discutent pas, confondent la rime et l'acte
La fuite et le suicide, un pacte, une promo sans tract
Pas trop de mots no body n'a capté le sale souhait
L'envie de se laisser par le cou pendu
Pour punir les parents qui, pour aimer l'enfant
Ont trop attendu, car si l'amour est une course
L'enfant naît c'est le départ en tête, l'embêtement
Comme passe-temps en fait des parents bêtes!
Maîtrise lancinante, sentiments en ciment sinon
Dans six ans on me retrouve ciseaux dans le crâne
Dans le sang gisant

T'es l'enfant seul (dis-moi que c'est toi)

L'enfant seul c'est l'inconnu muet du fond de classe
Celui de qui l'on se moque, rond comme
Coluche, ou le boss dans le hall, au groupe
Massif, l'os dans le steak haché - plantant
Chaque postulant à son poste
Vu que les conneries de gosses des rues couvrent
Souvent un jeune qui souffre d'un gros gouffre affectif
Grandir sans père c'est dur
Même si la mère persévère
Ça sert mais pas à trouver ses repères c'est sûr!
Perdre sa mère c'est pire! Demande à Pit je t'assure
T'as pas saisi enlève la mer de la Côte D'Azur
Quand ces gosses poussent leur souffrance aussi
Nous savons tous que personne ne guérit de son enfance
Même un torse poilu ne peut oublier sa vie de
Gosse du divorce rossé par son beau-père

En plongée constante, vu qu'à la surface l'apparence trompe.

Une ancienne espèce est en voie d'apparition

A ce rythme on sera bientôt les derniers animaux 
Visiteurs impolis, passagers en escale venus lâcher bombes atomiques

L’arme à la main, mais sans qu’tout ça m’alarme
Je flippe quand même du paradoxe
Et puis quand j’en lé-par à Ox
Y’m dit « viens on fait un morceau entre gun et rose »
C’est l’intifada dans les cœurs
Dans les têtes c’est vie d’film
Entre flingues et roses, on est tous victime
De ces sentiments qui s’mêlent
Même posé il y a des contrats qui s’fêlent
Comme une pluie de grêle en été
Fragile comme du cristal
La ligne s’brise aussi vite que j’kique un freestyle.
Comme ce type plein de haine
Tuant sa femme par amour
Plein de regrets, plein de peines
Les yeux mouillés devant le Cour d’Assise
Chacun ses démons, quand l’diable nous fait dé-ban 
A tous la force nous fait défaut
Et c’est chaque fois le même défi
Suivre le bien alors qu’le mal
nous met tous en appétit


Tantôt aigri ou tantôt heureux de vivre
Ca dépend d’la lumière que j’veux bien laisser entrer
Dans c’qui m’sert de cerveau en fait il n’y pas plus trop d’heure de libre
Pour une suite d’idées claires et sensées
C’est rarement blanc ou noir, bien ou mal, flingue ou rose
C’est jamais clair même quand les zin-cou causent

De bain douche, de bain de foule
D’plein d’coup, de plein de fouf
Comme partout besoin de sous.

regarde comme le quartier regorge
d’enfants doués, carrières trouées
parce qu’on mélange vice et vertu
d’où es-tu toi pour douter, noué, 
l’estomac vide, les yeux vitreux
tout est flouté
Malgré ça j’perd pas d’vue que
Les roses ici sont épineuses, laissant plus d’ecchymoses
Qu’un flingue enrayé, grillé parce que dès qu’il ose
Recommencer 
Une fois la gâchette ankylosée, tu sais comment c’est
C’est pour ça qu’j’mets de l’amour dans ma vie
Afin de noyer ma haine
Et si donc aujourd’hui j’décide de broyer ma peine
C’est que c’est bien plus près de
L’odeur des roses, que je veux vivre
Mais toujours un calibre sous l’oreiller.",Un Flingue et des Roses,2004
Oxmo Puccino,"Je vais te rapper doucement, car à crier tous mentent,
Ecoutes ça ! Ou je vous laisse entre toi et tes sous-vêtements,
Je veux bien que tu prennes l'initiative,
Tu proposes rien d'intime, que du déjà vu
Femme nue n'épates plus !
Oui je mens et la Terre est plate,
Tant d'électrons libres parmi eux combien s'éclatent ?
On s'induit en erreur à coucher sans séduire un minimum
Cette philosophie unique sur dix milles hommes
J'ai réalisé les réactions devant l'absence
Le jeu du chat et de la souris n'a pas de sens
Quand une chatte sourit sous la caresse
A la vitesse où les gens se remplacent
Sur ces instants j’mets l'accent grave
Laisses-moi flirter, t'effleurer, te regarder
Tu souhaites me garder
Je raccroche et vais me garer

Laisses-moi flirter
Ne vas pas si vite
Laisses-moi flirter
Si j'hésite

L'exception confirme l'aigle, alors j'ai pris mon envol
Ce soir pour une demoiselle que je dois rendre folle
L'important n'est pas de participer
Après réflexions
Valait-il pas mieux partir pisser
Tu m'as mis un brillant string
Mais as-tu pensé un strip
Tu me redeshabilles, comme on va taper un sprint
Expliques-moi quelle est cette impatience
A chaque fois t'espères et tu sais comment c'est
Sois pas celle de plus venue rater ma science
Changes tes méthodes te contentes pas de recommencer
Coupes la lumière que j'ai le vertige dans tes courbes
Courte est la vie, à l'aube je dois retourner dans la vIE

Douze coups de mi-nuit aucune de baguette magique
Le bonheur n'est pas derrière la braguette gee
Pas de pénètre, aucune plainte, aucun regret, pas de peine
Dis-moi peut-être laisses la fenêtre ouverte
Au moment adéquat
Différent toujours est l'effet

Sans que t'aies vu ma tour Eiffel
Jamais ça sera la même hier

Oxmo Puccino,"Lyrics apaisants je rappe les oiseaux se taisent 
Fais-toi plaisir, écoutes ça avec ta daisy 
Ce matin j'suis bien dans ma peau, j'ai la pêche telle cette femme qui 
Dame des parts de tartes par dizaines 
Te dis pas frappé par un maléfice 
Recommences ta vie à zéro quand je la redémarre à moins dix 
Je suis né blasé sans un sous, 
Puis brassé me suis retrouvé sans issue 
J'suis rentré en collision avec mes obstacles 
Tourne le pire à la dérision, l'offre en spectacle 
Je me dois de tout tuer pour ceux qui n'ont pas le choix 
Ma chanson va pas sauver le monde, tant pis pour cette fois 
Si j'avais entendu les profs, je serais pas le type 
Dont on étudie l'écriture laisses les rire, faire mon truc 
Je me suis fixé ce but si j'arrive à mi-chemin 
Je ferai date comme ce tigre tué par un caniche nain 
Tu connaîtras jamais la fin de l'histoire 
En faisant demi-tour à deux minutes de la victoire 
On peut viser ton blé, ta femme et son vison 
Mais, qui peut se vanter d'avoir touché l'horizon 


J’irai plus loin que l’horizon 
C’est bien mieux que le bout de son nez 
Tous les murs qui nous bloquent brisons 
Avances et laisses-les klaxonner 
Viens, la vitesse de mon son frisons. 


Je me sens encore de ceux sur qui nul ne miserait 
Autant de chapitres que de poils possède un bison 
J'enchaîne les brochettes de problèmes, uppercut, eskive, crochet 
Le revers de la médaille c'est mon emblème 
Tu déconnes avec tes tonnes de projets 
Ils vont encore s'entasser avec ceux de l'année prochaine 
Viens, j'ai fait le plein de patience, 
Y'a assez d'essence pour rouler jusqu'à l'horizon 
Qui m'aime me suive 
Amène les cuivres, les guitares 
Du pain et de l'huile d'olive 
Le seul raccourci et ma potion, ne suis pas les panneaux 
Aucun n'indique la bonne destination action laisses-moi kiffer ma passion 
M'échapper car à chaque page des marionnettes rêvent qu'on m'isole hélas 
Plus on est de fous on évite la camisole

Le plan se trouve en bas à gauche juste après do ré mi sol",Toucher l'Horizon,2004
Oxmo Puccino,"Quand le chagrin s’évapore et laisse place aux décombres, 
Je puise à la surface de ce que j'ai de plus sombre 
Un soir à son chevet, l'amour m'a dit laisse petit 
Ne fais pas ce titre, ta musique est sinistre, 
Je lui ai répondu du tac au tac, je serai seul à ton enterrement 
Donc je serai ton ministre, pas celui qui milite, ni le bouc émissaire 
Désormais il fera nuit sur les deux hémisphères, 
Il ne te reste que quelques heures à vivre, après la fin du monde, 
Il faudra se contenter d'autre chose, pour que nos coeurs vibrent
T'abordes une jolie, racontes pas ta vie, négocies 
C'est ce dont il s'agit dès que la queue s'agite 
Assis, j'ai cogité comme l'eau se paye, 
Voici l'écrasante vérité pour tes orteils 
On ne prouve rien à ceux qui disent que l'amour est mort 
Aimer d'accord, mais l’arrangement d'abord 

La mélodie n'est pas marrante 
Faut que ça rentre, l'amour est mort, mais 
C'est pas moi s’il est dead 
Vas comprendre et prends le comme ça t'arrange 
L'amour est mort, mets bien ça dans ta tête ! 

C'est formel, l'amour est mort mais c'est pas moi qui l'ai tué 
Devrais-je en faire une belle chanson que le public puisse se ruer 
Faudrait pas se tromper de fautif c'est 
Vous qui ne pouvez vivre ensemble sans vous pifrer, 
Trinquer sans critiquer son prochain
Incapable de se réconcilier, 
Malgré tous ces bons souvenirs, quelques bons conseillers 
Comment cela a-t-il pu advenir, là n'est plus la question, 
L'erreur est humaine, là n'est pas la réponse 
Il est clair que chaque altercation m'interpelle 
De celle du couple, à celles qui nourrissent Interpol 
Dans mes pages peu de messages d'espoir 
Juste une nouvelle histoire 
A ne pas croire 
Et si je dis n'importe quoi 
Vas-y vis une belle histoire 
Et je la raconterai c’soir 
Espèce d'enfoiré ! Cesses de blaguer","L' Amour Est Mort, Mets ...",2005

Sur ma desperado moto quelle chance je capte

J’aurais pensé que m’etaient destinées ces injures misogynes quand il rugit cria 
Sale karateka de black desperado, on aura ta peau, fallait rester sur ta moto

J'esquive sa gauche en finesse, 
En traître j'dégaine un lance roquettes

Nous voilà dans la salle atmosphère glauque 
Le rap francais baillonné par terre, frôle l'agonie 
Un public déçu me cerne 
Un couplet dans le chargeur, dites-moi comment tenir un concert 
Un dernier regard au rap français 
Et je m'élance à l'avant de la scène, mic en avant 
La voix en l'air 
Chaque mot doit toucher sa cible 
Si ma vocale en traverse dix 

Je vise même le trapéziste 
Flow élastique combinaison de consonnes, 
Des phrases connes qui sonnent 
Appelles-moi aussi joe l'astuce. 
Ce qui se passe t’y penses pas

Il a mal aux pieds, boite et danse à cloche pattes 
On remercie qui ? Qui ?

je ne suis pas venu trainer... 
juste le temps de me présenter 
l'entité à l'existence réfuté, 
enterré, puis ressuscité 
trêve de plaisanterie 
Je suis le cactus de Sibérie 
peu m'ont vu de près, 
la crème de la crème une espèce unique. 
les gens adorent les couleurs flamboyante pas ceux qui les portent 
raison pour laquelle tu ne me verras pas dans un parc 
plutôt de nuit garé dans un parking, en train de smoke entre cactus 
j'essayais de faire une place la ou la glace ne fonds pas 
j'ai quitté la queue, et gouter la mise à l'écart 
il pleut, il est tard, tout ce que m'inspire cet abribus 
Cette habitude, me fait ressembler au cactus de Sibérie 
le cactus de Siberie 
tellement les pieds sur terre que j'ai pris racine, 
sous ce calme, des épines à la nitroglycérine. 
il s'avère qu'à la fontaine chacun veut trois verre de lait, 
je préfère rester là  planté à rapper aidez les ! 
j'aurais pu etre plus commercial qu'un bouquet de roses, 
si st valentin m'avais pas volé toutes mes proses 
De ceux qui n'attendent pas qu'on les arrose et durcissent 
le temps n'a pas déformé mes propos, ils murissent 
tu as perdu ta température des pyramides 
refroidis d'avoir fréquenté les pires amis 
tu peux aiguiser tes piquants tant que les gens veulent du piment 
va te frotter tu connaitras de nouveaux sentiments 

un jour tony m'as dit ox, t'as trouvé plus de joie 
dans la tristesse que toi dans la joie 
plus qu'un p'tit coup de pouce de l'exterieur 
mon flow réconforte ceux dont les pics poussent vers l'intérieur 
j'tire ta peine vers le haut 
que ton plaisir atteigne des sommets 
grimpe c'est moi le capitaine de ce bateau 
ma sève est mélodique , savais tu qu'un cactus avait une fleurs 
Au milieu des piques se cache un cœur 
on t'as offert un cactus de sibérie 
en effet c'est moins pénible 
qu'un bouquet qui fane

Oxmo Puccino,"C'est peut-être la dernière fois que tu m'aimes 
Apprécies jusqu’à te lasser 
Inattendu comme une grossesse Oxmo 
Puccino, faut que je réagisse avant que je change 
A tes yeux à cause de ce que les gens nomment 
Le succès, stress, tu sais pas ce que c'est, tu plais 
Tu fais des tunes, le jour ou t'es plus en vogue 
Creuser mes neurones, m’lever à l'aube, pas d'écarts connard 
Car j'ai capté tôt l'art de jacter, pas d’pot 
Trop de groupes nous punissent, font écouter des démos 
Que des maux de têtes, visent le jackpot 
Moi quand je rappe déjà j'ai plus de potes 
Ce qui compte c'est le poste des fans, 
Le boss défonce ses cordes vocales 
Ecartes-toi des baffles, j'ai tellement de puissance, 
Même sans mic ma bouche est enceinte. 

J’dois beaucoup à mes fans
applaudissez-moi que je m'enflamme 
Flattez-moi, hommes et femmes 
Maman, ce soir je passe à la télé 
Promis, j’vais trouver un vrai job 
Mais ce soir je dois contempler 
Mes fans 

Suite à des hivers d'étude des rues j'ai conclu, 
""que le crime ne paie pas"",  le taf non plus ! 
A vingt ans j'ai fait à mon père et mes potes 
Fuck that shit, je me lance dans le rap 
Et pas le boogie-woogie, le hardcore 
Qui te casse le bras, tel David Douillet 
Et si y'a pas de sous, je m'en battais les douilles 
M'ont dit l'est fou lui, tant qu'y a la vibe aie aie aie 
Tenez le cap Abdoulaye, 
Sois pas désolé, Ox t'as pas fait platine 
Cousine, j'ai fait ma first rime sans un centime 
Mon vrai sentiment changer de branche avant la ruine 
La carotte est cuite, ma tranche fine 
La fin d'une vie d'artiste se peut discréditante 
Stylo posé je reprends mes distances 

Avant je rappais, pour être le best, maintenant c'est pour que 
Mes potes soient fiers de moi, que mes fans me checkent 
Tant qu'on me félicite, maison de disque fait les chèques, 
Impossible de me suivre, j'ai défait l'échelle 
J'ai jamais voulu être une star 
J'voulais juste gagner des prix Nobel au moins des oscars 
Mon fan club suffit seulement d'aimer ce morceau pour y être 
Jamais aux oubliettes, mes textes tous d'hier,

Le temps est venu d’honorer vos dettes
Après ce morceau, quand vous aurez bien ri

Ce son c'est pour les bouffons et les gangsters 
Ceux qui dépensent par le caleçon ceux qui payent avec l'holster 
M'en veux pas si j'faisais du pèze je sais ce que c'est 
Que d'être à sec à la quête aux obsèques d'un pote. 
Donc, sur ce sujet, jamais d'excès de zèle, 
De source sûre, tu peux crever d'un bretzel 
Tout est dit donnes, rends mon pèze car si tu te casses demain 
 tes proches, ta maîtresse, tes gosses, froisseront le testament 
Rends-le moi que je claque tout, personne n'hérite, 
T'arriveras troisième couplet c'est que je le mérite. 
Maintenant tu donnes ! Mon deuxième album etait bénévole 
Autant de peine qu'en Sibérie, danse baby vole 
Et puis c'est si terrible, t'y croirais pas si c'est gratuit 
Les gens ont besoin de prix j'vais pas te le traduire 
Je suis venu quand même 
J'savais que t'avais pas mon pesos 
Tu l'as claqué avec une pale copie de Kate Moss 

Rend-moi mon pèze

Rends-moi ce que j'tai prêté, 
Et remonte ce truc, ou comment j'vais te traiter 
J'ai pas dit rends-moi ma baise, rends-moi pèze 
Perds tes habitudes, ou je donne ton nom 
O x mo ainsi ça s'épelle, tu ne peux test, 
Expulse toutes ces  hypothèses de ta tête 
Pour faire du pèze faut des carabines à baratine 
Après les booms, gros globe trotter dans les bars à tinpes 
J'ai connu l'argent du risque avant la sueur du taf 
Surtout le salaire de la peur avant celle du taf 
Humm, rends-moi en beaucoup, que je récupère un peu de ce qu'on 
M'a volé, on partagera mon pochon de skonk 
C'est thieb oujem pour mes amis, 
A l'addition j'ai vu ton billet, dis où tu l'as mis ? 
Papy, les imbéciles, ils disent que c'est le leur 
Incompris ou pas cotisent même si ils pleurent ! 

Rends-moi mon pèze 

Les naïfs pensent que le pèze retient la belle 
J'en ai connu des belles, t'en as peut-être fait une mère 
Vous paierez plus que le puissiez 
Apprends que le pèze se paye au kilodrame 
On croque ta cuisse comme les huissiers 
Mon texte est grave, comme le pèze trop froid 
Tous les  chemins du pèze mènent au père Lachaise 
Train couchette bondé tu perds même la chaise

Rends-moi mon pèze",Mon Pèze,2005
Oxmo Puccino,"Voici venue l’heure du crime

Officiellement dans les premiers appelés,
C'est ma soeur de couleur, j'ai scellé la porte et fondu la clé
Privé de sortie tes yeux sont gonflés
L'insomnie me poursuit quand t'as la chance de ronfler,
Remercie plutôt tes parents de s'inquiéter quand t'es pas rentré, 
C'est le crépuscule la crapule en toi sort d'entre parenthèses
L'ambiance est maléfique, tu te découvres un autre visage,
Tu changes d'accoutrement qui sait ce qui s'envisage,
Restes sourd à ses coups de fil
Où tes pieds décollent, suspendu au cou par un bout de ficelle
Découpez les fils, y’a plus de crédit, j'ai détruit l'antenne
Jetez la batterie, il sonne quand même
La nuit t'appelle
 
La nuit elle t'appelle pas par hey yo
Quel angoissant silence radio, 
T'es pas chez toi, non
T'es bien dans son royaume
Ce tourbillon dans tes boyaux, 
Je sais j'en suis resté éveillé des millions
Qui ne croyait pas aux fantômes
Lumière éteinte la pénombre
Te fait crier, ho non
Ce n'était que des ombres 
Tu dois avoir tes raisons
La nuit les hommes ne sont pas pareils
 

T'es ivre à blâmer et la nuit t'appelle
Elle t'attend au bout de la route armée de sa pioche, sa pelle
Les flashs me reviennent, coupent mon sommeil au scalpel
Je lui disais prends ce top model et réserve à l'hôtel
Préserves toi des cocktails où ton volant se bloque
Sous les forces invisibles au troisième virage
Arrive l'imprévisible, évites ces heures où le froid rôde
Caches tes émeraudes, secoues tes éperons, galopes vers le hall
Tu recomposes ton digicode, pourtant derrière toi y'a personne
Tes battements de coeur s'accélèrent comme si ta dernière heure sonne
Elle confond pas parler fort et être forte
Les yeux ouverts tu rêves de bruit lorsqu'elle chuchote
Les fenêtres claquent et les rideaux flottent
Le soleil fuit, les démons complotent
Lorsqu'elle m'appelle tant pis pour ma belle
Sur elle se replie la couette
Une feuille m'attend, roulons vers Black Poeto.


Le matin revenu, certains ont perdu la boussole
Aux jeux d'argent clandestins du deuxième sous-sol

""n""ième passage à la douane espagnole
C'est l'heure de ""pointe"" donc les rames se vident
Je voulais pas rater le dernier d'une heure moins dix
A pied, pas fini de traverser la ville
Quartier sensible, les jeunes se font la guerre civile
La nuit porte conseil à la fin c'est elle qui décide
Elle t'appelle en traître dès que le jour se retire

Des hommes se remboursent à la baïonette
Le silence y est rare comme un mari honnête
J'ai deux serveuses, c'est des majorettes


Des véhicules de luxe mal garés
Paroles sincères sans franc parler
T'allais dormir en croisant des beautés
Tu es tombé amoureux d'une prostituée
Bijouterie ambulante, fille dénudée
L'adresse est connue des ambulanciers
C'est le rendez-vous des loups, pas des brebis
Les fous réfléchissent avant d'y risquer un crédit
L'affaire tourne, rideaux baissés
Cadence rapide le batteur est pressé
Parce qu'il faut couvrir les conversations
Quelqu'un surveille tes fréquentations
Le barman, c'est Tookie
Pour la police, Tookie
Des liens dans la famille Puccino

Le silence y est rare comme un mari honnête
J'ai deux serveuses, c'est des majorettes

Ouvert du café à l'apéro
C'est d'ici que démarrent tous les ragots
Ici, les pieux sont de confession financière
Même le chat cache son flingue sous la litière
Chaque trou et ruelle à son Lipopette
C'est la vie pas nous qui sommes malhonnêtes
C'est l'esprit Lipopette, bar Lipopette

Oxmo Puccino,"Très petits les enfants aiment perdre la tête
Les années passent, on recherche le vertige
Tout le monde a commencé pareil
Au détour d'une nuit sans merveille
De temps en temps, c'est devenu régulier
On commence à plusieurs ça devient singulier
Tu l'as dans la peau
Tu peux plus partager, plutôt nager parmi les piranhas
Comment quitter la pire nana
Si c'est pour perdre un peu de son nirvana

Nirvana, nirvana, viens faire une p’tite balade
Nirvana, nirvana, nirvana, nirvana,
Chacun son nirvana, nirvana, nirvana

Un garrot une connexion haut débit dans les veines
Couché sur l'ordi pour dormir sur MSN
Hypnotisé devant son moniteur
Déconnecté, il pourrait oublier Monica
Égoïste, touché d'astéroïde quitte à être
Hors la L.O.I, sportifs sous stéroïdes
Chacun ses parenthèses
Combien de sourires cachent la fournaise
Ce côté de toi que tu découvres, t'abîme
Te choque comme une tournante entre mineurs
Chéries qui se guérissent en faisant du shopping
Pères de famille qui mentent à ses copines
Dévoile-moi ton péché, j'ai rien à te reprocher
Quand on sait ce que l'homme vaut, 
On se ne fatigue pas à prêcher
Dans ce désordre mondial, sache que chaque mal
Est causé pour un nirvana

Nirvana, nirvana, viens faire une p’tite balade
Nirvana, nirvana, nirvana, nirvana,
Chacun son nirvana, nirvana, nirvana

Le bien nécessite un mal jamais on sera rassasié
Une fois c'est trop, mille fois c'est pas assez
Tu as juré d'arrêter, mais la vérité c'est que,
Tu ne fais que recommencer et recommencer sans cesse
Quand c'est bon, on réitère
Pour l'obtenir y'a plus de mère ni père
Tu as tout perdu aux dés, mauvais chiffres
Va réemprunter, parier, revivre l'ivresse
Cerveau en satellite, l'alphabet satanique
ABCD, MDMA, PSP, CC, GHB
Dans ce monde où tout peut s'acheter
Tu te sens libéré, t'as le rire bavard
Capturé par ton nirvana

Dédicace à ma maîtresse, Juana, Marie Juana",Nirvana,2006
Oxmo Puccino,"Ce soir, la ville est déserte 
Toute la Terre est là, guichets fermés
Marmelade, public énervé
Température élevée, à minuit 
Pour les applaudissements même le jour se lève 
Mondiale est la retransmission 
Radio,  toutes les télévisions 
Des invités aussi connus que Cousteau
Plus de sponsors qu’un match de football
Des présidents à côté des bandits au premier rang
Chaque musicien prend soin de ses parents
Tout le monde s’est déplacé pour elle
Hélas quelqu’un manque à l’appel

Mais où est Billie ?
On ne sait pas 
Qu’aucune hypothèse ne s’écarte
Mais où est Billie ?
On ne sait pas 
Au Lipopette ? sûrement pas 
Mais où est Billie ?
On ne sait pas 
Aucune hypothèse ne s’écarte
Mais où est Billie ?
On ne sait pas
Au Lipopette ? sûrement pas

On chuchote que la diva est malade
Caprice, kidnapping, tout y passe
Où est la beauté vocale, pour l’appel au calme
Les premières bagarres éclatent au bar 
Des fausses places circulent ce n’est pas réjouissant
Devant on se bouscule, y a des évanouissements
Le promoteur pleure, ça le rendrait mignon 
Si ses pertes n’atteignaient pas le million 
Ça fait un long moment que la loge est vide 
Le front du garde du corps devient humide 
Son agent qui parlait partout devient timide 
Le tôlier descend des verres dans le living 
Cinq milles personnes se posent la même question
Ce qui est sur c’est qu’on ne sait pas

Mais où est Billie ?
On ne sait pas 
Qu’aucune hypothèse ne s’écarte

Oxmo Puccino,"Il y a des jours qu’on attend plus que d’autres
Comme ce jour ou l’on marche vers le trône 
La cousine venue accompagner Kali 
Ce genre de fleurs que t’aimerais dans ton panier
Elle était superbe, rendait les hommes carnivores 
Un fantasme de peintre dans toutes ses formes
Les soirées people elle adore, cousine Billie fuit la foule 
Strass et paillettes la rendent  pas folle 
Mais Today, Kali passait l’audition ultime
Adieu les boulots de merdes, vive la musique !
On sait bien qu’elle va y arriver 
Quand on mise tout
Un rêve doit se réaliser, non

Perdre et gagner 
Savoir perdre, gagner
Reperdre, gagner sans s’éloigner de soi-même 
Rare les épargnés
On peut à la fois perdre, gagner 
Telle une triste mariée

Après 76 candidates, c’est le tour de Kali,
C’est parti pour la favorite
La beauté panique puis trouve la force
Elle entame la chanson, les yeux clignotent
Enchante le jury, sur c’est dans la poche
Au fur à mesure, les pieds battent la mesure
La cour est conquise, la voix s’élève et s’envole
Kali pilote, prestance de marquise 
Lorsqu’un jeune homme s’invite à l’inaperçu 
Chuchote les mots qui percutent, au visage du producteur
Qui enchaîne un saut d’humeur
Au lieu de la féliciter le chef du jury s’ excuse
Y a des capacités, mais on ne cherche plus, on a trouvé la perle
Veuillez pardonner, etc... laissez vos coordonnées
C’est bien gentil, mais lorsque ton rêve s’écroule
Les explications t’en as rien à foutre, 
Ce n’est pas pour aujourd’hui Kali
Quelquefois c’est ainsi 

Perdre et gagner 
Savoir perdre, gagner
Reperdre, gagner sans s’éloigner de soi-même 
Rare les épargnés
On peut à la fois perdre, gagner 
Telle une triste mariée

Kali pleurait plus qu’elle n’en pouvait 
Billie se mit à chanter pour détendre l’atmosphère
Doucement il se passe quelque chose de magique, 
Ceux qui sont de dos regardent en oblique
Billie est saisie, lorsque s’adresse à elle 
Cette voix d’homme pleine de courtoisie
Tenez ma carte, venez à ce rendez vous
Une voix comme la vôtre se réécoute,
Parole de producteur aucun doute
Je suis envoyé pour faire de vous la vedette
Billie tombe dans l'incompréhension
Kali sombre dans la déception 
Comment était ce possible
Kali, humiliée par sa propre famille
Quelle injustice, des larmes durcissent
Ainsi de suite, c’est perdre et gagner
Reperdre et gagner

Perdre et gagner

Reperdre, gagner sans s’éloigner de soi-même 
Rare les épargnés
On peut à la fois perdre, gagner

Oxmo Puccino,"Les enfants, je vais vous raconter l’histoire du lapin qui se prenait pour un lion 
Et qui après son arnaque pensait prendre l’avion 

Hey chérie ce soir je rentre avec deux billets d’avions
Prépare bagages et champagne, on part pour les Caraïbes
Si Yuri préférait Kali, le poker était sa passion
Voici les points clés de ma narration 
Il attendit qu’elle soit sous la douche pour aller aux toilettes
Où était dissimulée cette mallette 
Descendons voir ce que le frérot propose 
Un alibi tout droit sorti d’un cerveau  de guimauve
Une soirée entre potes loin des entrepôts
Yuri chipote, mais bon il était trop tôt 
On sait qui des deux eut la mauvaise idée de passer au Lipopette
Pour quelques verres à vider
Mais, quand on suit un plan il faut s’y tenir
Y a toujours d’un hic pour s’en souvenir 

Ce type s’était pris pour un félin 
Il avait assez, mais en voulait plus 
Ne course pas le lapin 
Aujourd’hui les chasseurs 
Remplissent ton chargeur
Avant la roulette russe

Assis de dos Pat Phil mélangeait 
Des cartes sur un tapis vert
Whisky plein le verre
J’ai un salaire à perdre, lança-t-il 
Que les chanceux se dépêchent 
L’argent, c’est volatil
Évidemment le frère voulut retenir Yuri 
Mais peut-on empêcher un scorpion de mourir Yuri 
Ne put résister à son vice 
La première mise fut de 800 billets
Il gagna le double, au lieu tailler
La vermine remise trois fois de suite
S’emmêle les pinces dans le jeux de Pat 
Coincé entre deux quintes Yuri termine
Par perdre les billets, et les clés de sa berline
Ça fait longtemps que Pat Phil attend ce moment 
Autour du Yuri, le piège se ferme doucement 
Le sourire de Pat nous renseigne
C’est là que la mallette entre en scène

Yuri s’était pris pour un félin 
Il avait assez, mais en voulait plus
Ne course pas le lapin
Aujourd’hui les chasseurs
Remplissent ton chargeur 
Avant la roulette russe

Dans la rue n’accumule les dettes auprès de personne 
Ou tu perds la vie au-dessus d’une certaine somme
Et comme vous Yuri tenait à la sienne 
Obligé de couper en deux le coup du siècle   
Écoute Pat, retiens ce mot de passe,
Mets ce chapeau, mon frère t’accompagne, prends l’adresse
Trois hommes vous attendent à l’entrepôt, oui 
Tu fais l’échange, ramène l’autre colis 

À tout de suite répondit Pat 
Si tu m’as eu, je ne te raterais pas! Fils…!

Deux silhouettes s’évaporent dans le brouillard
Un réverbère et son reflet sur le boulevard 

Enfin s’en va le vrai félin
Qui a mérité ce qu’il avait eu 
Pat le chasseur 
Avait rempli le chargeur
Yuri a joué, et il s’est tiré dessus",La Roulette Russe,2006
Oxmo Puccino,"Tu sais lorsque les gens disent que ton destin est écrit quand t’es petit,
Ils oublient que le stylo c’est le coin où t’as grandi.
Alors il s’est retrouvé dans la rue un matin d’hiver 
Avec les meubles sa sœur et sa mère.
Des histoires comme ça ici y'en a des tas
Lui resta sur le bitume, il fit carrière. 
Gravit les échelons sans brûler aucune étape,
Trafic, prison, jusqu’aux affaires d’état.
Aujourd'hui c’est jeudi, il veut l’acheter ce bar, changer de statut, se barrer d’ici.
Depuis peu vacciné contre le sushi 
Parce que, dans la vie, il aime ce qui croustille.
En pensant à sa traductrice, il met son plus beau slip.
En se demandant où trouver de grosses tulipes.
Parce que tu sais, tout le monde, 
Tout le monde pense à se ranger, à faire des gosses.
Alors Tito se laisse glisser en ville dans son beau carrosse

Tito répondait qu’une fois sur dix
D’après lui c'est le raccourci dans les tragédies
Répondre à cet appel est mauvais signe
Le numéro c'est Barbie qui sans prévenir
« Allô Tito si tu ne m’aides pas ma vie peut se perdre
On peut plus reculer, j’attends ça depuis deux semaines
Mon chauffeur est couché, tu conduis l’aller-retour
Tu me dois bien ça j’attends en bas des tours »

Sortir pour un rancard sexy se retrouver habillé en noir mais ash !…
Trois hommes silencieux vérifient les armes
Deux sortent, Barbie attrape une enveloppe
Puis la lâcha de sitôt, démarre si je rate la négos
Ce qu'il y a dans le coffre tu laisses à mes gosses
À peine une clope allumée, des coups de feu retentissent
Tito tire sur la vitre, s’élance atterrit sur une scène hallucinante
Au sol du sang Barbie immobile à ses pieds
Une enveloppe, des bruits de pas brisent le silence
Un inconnu s’arrête, son regard en dit long
Un chapeau qui cachait mal une tête de flic
Là ça se complique
Tito réfléchit vite
Tito vise, hésite, lui fait une fleur
Ramasse l’enveloppe, quitte le secteur
Pistolet planqué dans le paquet de chips
Avant d’aller chez le fleuriste faut brûler cette jeep
Un taxi pour ne pas manquer Habibi
Passer une bonne soirée et se faire un alibi",Tito,2006
Oxmo Puccino,"Les instructions sont claires et précises
Ramène ce taxi, va
Ton cash bronze à la frontière mexicaine
Après cette mission j’arrête, vive les week-ends
Le Uzi scotche la boîte de vitesse
Étant trop loin d’la ville
Si l’itinéraire était secret, qui me file?
Un tout-terrain squatte dans mon rétroviseur
Un choix s’impose: improviser ou préparer le gros viseur
Mieux vaut secourir une auto-stoppeuse
Qu'une auto stoppée, vide, en panne et en plein désert
Ils sont deux, le chauffeur sort, le passager couvre en une deux
Le coffre de mon taxi est ouvert, le colis est lourd
Messieurs, please puis-je vous aider?
J’étais aller pisser


Baisse ta main, si tu savais dans ce taxi
Tu crierais de peur, tu viderais ta vessie
Le contrat est sur toi tu dois partir ainsi
Négocie pas (pa!) ainsi soit-il ça vaut (pa pa!)

Une balle pour celui de gauche, le second meurt de peur
Les sentiments, j’en ai selon mon humeur
Saperlipopette, soudain l’paquet m’appelle
Je charge les victimes, les sacs saignent, ils respirent
Un pied d’enfant dépasse du sachet
Ma découverte est impossible, ma peine mal cachée dans mes bras
T’as reconnu mon fils, ma raison d’vivre
Ma punition doit s’accomplir sur chaque complice
Tu peux te faire un visa, changer de visage
Tu vivras jamais assez pour savoir qui te visa
Au froc mon Beretta dans mes poches mes deux Glocks
Dans mon sac assez d’C4 pour que la mer s’écarte
Ils sont dans la mouise
Quelque dix grenades, j’allais oublier mon Uzi
Parti, bombarde, bombarde
La vengeance est un plan qui se mange chaud
Danger, à l’abri mon bambino
Retour à la case départ, le boss et moi faut qu’on parle
Sans tarder


Baisse ta main, si tu savais dans ce taxi
Tu crierais de peur, tu viderais ta vessie
Le contrat est sur toi tu dois partir ainsi
Négocie pas (pa!) ainsi soit-il ça vaut (pa pa!)


Juste assez d’essence, l’ascenseur explose
Dans l’noir sans boussole, en sous-sol, j’explore
À l’aise comme si j’avais fait c’plan
Voici la chambre du chef de mon ex-clan
Et vlan, j’défonce la porte, m’enfonce l’épaule
C’est là que foncent, des bullrots
Des bulldogs et rottweilers, est-ce mon heure?
Tous morts
Une gâchette à chaque doigt, bam!
Sors du placard serpillière, pas le temps d’faire ton sac
Ce métal sur ton front sera le dernier contact

Baisse ta main, si tu savais dans ce taxi
Tu crierais de peur, tu viderais ta vessie
Le contrat est sur toi tu dois partir ainsi
Négocie pas (pa!) ainsi soit-il ça vaut (pa pa!)",Tarif C,2006

J´viens du n ième rang, j´sais plus le combien tième round

Ne te déplace pas pour le trône ouais
T´es pas le premier vous êtes trop

On a gravit les échelons tout en restant underground
À l´école, quand les mômes répètent nos mots, on les gronde
Pas taillé pour ce rôle, je me voyais black à « wall street »
Mon complice ailier à Chelsea, hey yo notre histoire est celle-ci
Les gens comme nous, n´ont que jusqu´à 6, cette vie n´est pas juste
Pour toi les secondes s´allongent, l´arbitre compte jusqu´à douze
C´est dur abusé, coincé dans les cordes, je pense à décrocher la ceinture au pluriel
T´iras manger de l´ombre à la petite cuillère, car y´a pas de places pour deux gus 
Sur une civière, mec il faut que t´aime ox et kool shen
Ecoute cette chanson solide, comme un bout de chêne
Le seul round qui compte est indiqué par l´horloge

ne restent qu'une semaine sur 7, sans fumer de shit
Relations familiales enferme dehors, on reste des nuits entières sous le porche
Le derche collé au mur 
prends forme plate
Même si le froid éclate nos neurones
C'est rien car rien c'est tout ce qu'on a

As tu vu comment tu nous mate conard ?
Parce que tu rentre du taf le soir, tu te crois mieux que nous conard ?
Timbré d'être posté la, même le jour de l'an glandant comme hier
Pendant que tu tises en te faisant croire que tu t'amuses
troubles existentiels on consomme des substances illicites pour toucher le ciel
Vu le que la terre s'écroulent sous nos pieds
Juste ciel, qu'est ce qui se passe 6ème étage du bat c
Les bouts de shit s'effritent comme la matière du marchand de sable
Squat les escaliers comme si il y avait des lits, pour coucher la peine ensommeillé dans la fumée
La lumière se rallume, s'éteint, se rallume

J’écris si vite et encore, que la feuille s'est consumée
Si une fois n'est pas coutume, qu'est ce qu'est mille fois
Couché dans des spots qui puent la pisse
Les rares filles qui passent ont la chaude pisse
Parler au futur n'est qu'une triste fausse piste
Selon ta fonction....
Comme dans les films, j'ai des potes qui se font filocher
Je te parle même pas de leur soeur, qui sont des filles aussi,
Des cibles amenées à niquer avec des mecs de la cité ou autres
C’est pour ça qu'on ne déleste pas les ninjas, on se teste qu'entre nous
Des noirs et des arabes se blessent au chlasse
Pourquoi le hall est si dur les courses poursuites ne foutent
plus la frousse, plus aucune poussé d'adrénaline
Malgré ma ligne, je peux te le prouver, ma conscience assez maligne 
Chanceuse évita le fossé

Les gens croient ce qu'ils voient comme si sa suffisait
ne savent que les jeunes du hall, utilisent des canons uzi, parlent de 
Lait avant douze ans
cajoline c'est pas pour eux, la lavande c'est la came, ils veulent la vendre.
Maintenant je suis un jeune des hall des maisons de disques
y efritte mon shit cool come clean, comme jeru nique ta race

Je t'insulte pour rien car c'est l'esprit
Célèbre mc, ghetto célé-brisé

Les jeunes du hall, n'ont plus peur de la mort ni de la taule,
elle est devenue leur pote, et tes torpeurs les font sourire
Ils ne soupirent plus, quand ils vont en taule ils y sont déjà dehors

Tu laisses pousser la barbe quelque fois tu mets des lunettes

La main sur le métal, sous la douche ou à la buvette

Ils ont relâché ta soeur et ton père

Comme dit le maire de Toulouse la cavale c'est une double peine

le temps va tous s'en va

Jamais déçu si tous s'en vont c'est comme ça

Les solitaires se connaissent soit ton pote grave

Avion, destination chuuut !! Avant ça

Récupère tes tunes, chez ses enfoirés

Qui t'aurais pas envoyé de mandat, claque ton bif en soirée

Ancien associé nouveau ennemis t'es au courant

Devant l'argent plus de Bible de Torah ni de Coran

Il demande pas d'excuse

Pendants les chefs d'accusation

Car seul le dieu le juge

Ces choix, que seuls les grands de ce monde comprennent

7 fois ou dix, j'ai compris l'héritage qu'on traîne

Beaucoup de cas soce sulfurique quelques génies

Tous, fils d'ouvrier voulant ce qu'il mérite

J’ose un hommage aux gangsters

Car avant les rappeurs, footballeur

C’était eux les références majeures

Avec le peu offert, pour prendre l'envergure

Le choix, pas si mauvais juste plus dur

Contre le système, en colère

Rien lui suffit, surtout pas taffer

Subir les collègues de merde

Viser le milliard c'est un état d'esprit

Atteindre l'objectif, malgré le risque pris

Les voyous sont sur piédestal

Sorti de prison, à chez Ardisson

télé-mélange de stars

Les rappeurs se vantent de fréquenter des criminels

Tel un gosse avec capotes triple xl

Dans la rue des gens vivent

Oxmo Puccino,"Le bruit de la pluie sur le bitume, en panne d'essuie-glace 
Mon pare-brise pleure, mon humeur durcit la glace 
Ceux qui disent que ""le temps c'est de l'argent"" sont dans l'erreur, 
Si tu mets les euros de côté, pas les heures 
Je commande un café avant le texte pondu 
Demande mon dû, car j'ai posé avant que le sucre ait fondu 
Souvent on avance, le temps m'importe mon pote! 
Si tu ne peux être à l'heure faut que tu te téléportes 
Quand on se rate, y a pas de prochainement 
La vie est courte, et la mort a tout le temps, 
Né le matin, majeur à midi, vieux dès vingt heures 
L'histoire oublie les héros mais pas les vainqueurs 

365 jours puis 700, le temps commence à manquer tu l'espionnes 
365 jours puis 700, le temps commence à compter tu te questionnes 

La vérité dépend de celui qui écoute, 
Et peu importe ce qu'on dit le temps révèle tout, 
Le temps fait du bien à l'amour 
Contrairement à ce qu'on pense, 
Les regrets c'est quand on se goure concrètement 
Le mauvais temps n'est pas le froid ou le gris 
C'est ce qu'on s'était juré, qu'à force, on oublie, 
Quand j'arrive pas à écrire
Le mauvais temps, celui qui te ronge,
La migraine quand tu t'interroges. 
Les rêves s'éloignent tu cours à leur poursuite
En vieillissant de moins en moins de plumes pour suivre, 
La durée de ma chanson est décroissante, 
Désolé je ne sais compter que jusqu'à soixante. 

365 jours puis 700, le temps commence à manquer tu l'espionnes 
365 jours puis 700, le temps commence à compter tu te questionnes 

Vivre c'est des chiffres et des lettres des chutes et des litres 
Des chèques et des contrats, tout ce que tu pourras 
Et lorsque tu pourras plus, tout va ralentir 
Signe l'avenir devient repentir.
À chaque marche passée, l'escalier s'effondre 
Alors je saute en chantant sur chaque seconde 
La vie est un beau train avec de sales wagons. La chance vagabonde, 
J’attends pas qu'on m'approuve j'suis un grand de ce monde 
Compose avec la lumière en tant qu'homme de l'ombre

Oxmo Puccino,"Ce qui m'a sauvé c'est que je ne voulais pas faire de peine à mon père,
Qu'il dise ce gosse? non, je ne l'ai pas fait
J’ai trouvé ma voix le jour où j'ai pensé à tuer un homme
Donc j'suis bien placé pour parler de paix. J’évite de me répéter,
Alors je me tais lorsqu'il est trop tard pour bien faire
Comment apprécier la paix sans la guerre
Comme la fin et le début les deux font la paire
Je viens déclarer la paix, sans heurts
Quelques cartouches d'encre dans le chargeur.
C’est l’arme de paix

I guess I'm in the race
I'm tryin to win the chase
I'm trying to find my place 
And make it through the days
I'm in my corner store

Cette audace de parler de paix, pendant la fin des temps
Chanter contre ce futur sans précédent
Il le faut ce monde c'est le nôtre
Je pense qu'on tire bénéf du bien de l'autre inquiet car, au fond, je sais
Le malheur de l'un ne fait le bonheur de personne comprenez guérir est la seule porte
On ne peut que périr sous la loi du plus fort
La patience est plus efficace que la force 
Raison pour laquelle je ne milite pas
Qui insulte la paix ne la mérite pas
Chacun touchera sa part de l'héritage

I guess I'm in the race
I'm tryin to win the chase
I'm trying to find my place 
And make it through the days
I'm in my corner store

Je cherche l'impossible équilibre 
Sans en tuer dix pour que mille vivent
La paix à tout prix n'est plus la paix,
Je prends la peine d'un dernier appel
Les chanteurs de vérité sont des cracheurs de flammes
Sous feux des tirs d'armistice,
Je deviens un passeur de calme.
Un jour, l'injustice en personne
Fera tomber une larme

I'm trying to find my place 
and make it through the days

Aucun pour me compléter

Puis tu t'es préférée seule au fond de ton panier plutôt que mal accompagnée

À perdre dans tous les sens, tu n'attendais plus

Qu'aucune ne m'aurait dans la durée

Que la rage arrive par la vaisselle sale

A force de parler, on se contredis.
Quand on aide avec maladresse,
on peut faire du mal à ceux qu'on aime.
Remplacer un souci par un problème,
tu voulais bien faire mais ce fût le contraire.

ni ta joie ne font mon désespoir.

Une petite remise en question,
tu l'as pris comme une agression.
Quelle idée ? Envers et contre nous,
notre vie passera malgré tout,
à se rappelle de ce qu'on avait,
insatisfaits de c'qu'on est.
Peu le reconnaissent,
les plaisirs mesquins, les calculs bas,
conduisent à la surprise du résultat.

J'ai tailler mon cOEur de cristal,
car l'amour ne suffit pas.
Des familles éparpillées,
seules mais tristes par milliers.

J'ai surmonter mes erreurs,
me tromper m'a rendu meilleur.

cessons les sens uniques dés ce soir.

Sens inverse, on s'aime à sens inverse.
La terre tourne trop vite, ralentis pour moi...
Sens inverse, on s'aime à sens inverse.
La terre tourne trop vite, ralentis pour moi...

La vie n'a pas de sens, j'ai fait le deuil,
l'impression de n'avancer que sur feuille.
Devant cette distance que l'on a creuser,
on essuie les yeux comme si il pleuvait.
Je n'écris pas pour qu'on m'adore,
ni pour que l'on soit tous d'accord.
A courir tous dans le même sens,
il n'y aura qu'une conséquence.
Aussi tragique soit la destinée,
j'veux croire qu'on peut la dessiner.

Les une viennent presque a l heure les autres de blair witch
Les une invitées à diner les autres en sandwich
Tu mesure mal tu t trompé
Ta jeté l une a l eau et promis la lune a l autre
Les une ont tord les autres n ont pas raison
L essentiel c d être bien dans sa maison
Les une aiment ma plume les autres casse les burnes
Les une t ont au lit les autres à l usure
Hé ! Tu n auras pas la brune de la pub car on fréquente les autres pour en apprécié une !
Même l une après l autre

Quand c jolie comme sa
Mets-toi à notre place

Si les une sont bonnes c grâce aux autres
Elles sont beau être bonnes elles sont rien sans les autres
L une en a sous les bigoudis l autre dans le soutif
Les une nous marquent les autres ont les oublis
Les autres collections les une t aime comme tu es t apporte des corrections
Les autres veulent t apprivoiser et l une passe
Résultat tu as pris la voisine
Les une ont les présentent a nos mères parce que les autres c pas la peine elles en veulent a nos nerfs
Les une sont presque les autres a cotés
Les une sont cotés les autres sont suspectes
T en a aimé aucune des deux t loin de mes opinions
Les une discutent les autres se crêpent le chinions
Car sur un bateaux y a pas 10 capitaines
Les un les autres se mêlent avec elle
Envers son prochain l homme est un félin
A qui la faute si personne n est fait l un pour l autre

Oxmo Puccino,"Tu sauras jamais à quoi je pense, 
T'as pas encore décidé je suis déjà aux conséquences. 
Ma tête dans la molécule harmonique, j'écris lorsque les mots s'y percutent. Infini est mon aperçu, étrange mélange de douceur, quelque chose d'herculesque, 
Ox du prestige au burlesque, je gère avec ce que la vie me suggère. 
Si tu ne pleures pas depuis hier, c'est qu'on ne vit qu'à travers les proches et leurs prières. 
Si je me presse pour créer ce poème, aurais-je le temps d'en faire un deuxième?

Véridique

J'ai la potion le plan, mais ta notion du temps n'est pas assez importante, rien que tu te plains rien ne te plait. 
Un pote qui s'en fout quand tu t'inquiètes? 
Est ce ton pote? j'en doute: pense à ton assiette. 
Triste verdict, deux milles ans sont passés, tout pour le capital, 
De plus en plus riche et c'est le règne animal 
Maudite intelligence que l'on manie mal 
Malédiction.

Véridique 

T'as plus rien à donner, tant que t'as pas pardonné, 
Je gamberge debout sur mon balcon, je me fous de ton balconnet, 
Les souvenirs une enclume, plus d'encre dans le bâtonnet plume, 
Le regard brumeux vise prudemment, 
Souffrir, percer le secret de l'endurance. 
Laisse-moi kiffer ce pochon de weed, 
On a des potes qui ont pris perpétuité. 
Si la peine est une épée, prends cette parole comme un étui. 
C’est véridique",Véridique,2009
Oxmo Puccino,"Ce soir, il prendra les 400 coups
A ta chute ou à sa perte les paris vont doubler
Etre une star à la sueur de son coeur, le corps marqué par l'absence de la peur
Il 's'agit pas de chats miolants, juste des poids lourds dans une danse violente:
Prix Pulitzer d'espression corporelle,
Une collision de bull-dozer,
Triple accident de chars d'assaut;
Car il va falloir... Que tombe l'un de ces deux garçons, ce soir...

L'un de nous deux doit tomber en public;
Depuis, ton visage sur mes mirroirs
Couches-toi vite, j'ai une histoire à fonder,
Cela implique que ce soir...

Les vrais fous se font pas interner.
Ils rêvent les yeux ouverts, poings fermés
D't'façon, il n'y a pas de sous-métiers, encore moins celui de Champion du Monde entier.
Tellement ne save pas, hein, quand t'es seul sur le ring
J'en ai vu dans ce cas, leur jeans sentaient l'urine.
La vie est ironique: s'échapper des ruelles pour vivre de duels.
A la fin, y'aura qu'un type à l'horizontal, le respect mutuel, mais ce soir...

Tête haute, le corps aéroporté dans la bulle que forme la corde à sauter,
Instinct de survie prononcer, c'est le combat de l'épuisement contre la volonté.
C'est de là qu'elle partie, l'action: une science dont vous n'avez pas la notion.
Courir des milliers de kilomètres, se nourir par la force et finir honnête.
Mais l'ange douceur, le son du cuir qui cogne, il n'est pas naît d'une cité mais d'une cygogne.
Hélas... Ce soir... Hélas... Ce soir...",L'un de nous deux,2009
Oxmo Puccino,"Parce que la vie est amère
Comme un jus de pamplemousse, avec de la mousse de bière
Je sors au clair de lune avec ma guitare et de l'herbe
Afin de réchauffer les chaumières
Ma voix positivise dans les bagnoles 
Change les capotes en parasol
Quand pétillent des bulles de rigolade
Faut se taper des tranches de limonade
Saisir l'immensité de l'instant
La savourer dans son importance
Car perdre sa vie à la gagner
N'a plus de sens s'il faut s'éloigner.

Partir 5 minutes
Refaire l'histoire du monde, les soirs de pleine lune
Partir 5 minutes
Entourer de colombes, de minuit à midi.

Je rêve en rugissant, je vais là où le soleil et
La terre se touchent en rougissant
Les anges nous seront témoins
Ferme les yeux que j'attrape tes mains
On s'envole dans mon imagination,
Demain trop tard pour l'invitation
La ville est difficile allons à la campagne
On va gagner, sois douce quand tu m'accompagnes
On verra mes amis à Bogota ou Genève
Nous dessinerons des chansons dans la neige.
Parce que la première est toujours la dernière fois
Déguste chaque minute,
Vivre un perpétuel terminus
Comment faire quelques heures de 5 minutes

Partir 5 minutes
Refaire l'histoire du monde, les soirs de pleine lune
Partir 5 minutes
Entourer de colombes, de minuit à midi.

J'étanche ma soif de liberté,
Je te danse ma part d'éternité
Le bonheur, j'en ai un appétit populaire
Ma peine est profonde la sympathie naturelle
Laisse-moi juste 5 minutes, on verra le bout du tunnel
J’suis trop peace, mais j'm’en donne la peine
Craignant que sans moi la vie continue
Je chante pour sortir de ma bulle
Car le temps qui nous reste diminue
Je m'en vais porter par quelques libellules.

Oxmo Puccino,"Chacun sa vie, chacun son rôle

La rime toujours franche
Rien à cacher dans mes manches
Je suis devant ma page blanche
Faut pas que mon flow flanche
J'ai ce sentiment de plénitude, toujours constant
Une impression de sur-vital, se réactivant
Tous les jours je joue à fond le rôle de ma vie
J'me sens comme une poussière, sur l'échelle du temps infini
Pas besoin d'exagérer la réalité d'opérer qui me fait perdre le fil
Je joue mon rôle sans faire semblant de découvrir la lune
Même si comme activiste je fais figure de poids-plume
Je ne compte pas secourir, mais au moins soulager
Seul l'éveil des consciences dans ma musique est beauté

Chacun sa vie, chacun son rôle ...

Je cherche souvent à brûler mes sentiments
Et me laisse toujours pas apprivoiser, comme ça par le temps
Mes yeux rêvent en stoppant net chaque soir l’illusoire
Mais je me fous d'être raisonné c'est ce qui me tient à l'écart
J'ai l'esprit d'un chieur, j'suis un chieur prodige
J'suis prêt à tous les combats, c'est ça qui m'guide
Chaque jour, je vois le monde défiler devant moi
Et j'me rend compte que j'suis meilleur danseur que le Diable, crois-moi
Mon rôle, critiquer d'une ambition minimale, il me faut vivre avec et chaque seconde est primordiale
Mais je nourris un plus grand rêve pour défier le Réel
Avec le radin libertaire pour qu'il me pousse des ailes

Chacun sa vie, chacun son rôle...


De plus en plus les gens me reconnaissent
Plus je parle, moins il me connaissent
A fleurs de mots et de gimmicks
Je n’imite personne, on veut que je milite
Je ne combat pas des logos
Ma cause est mignonne
Lecture pour tous les mômes
Je ne pense qu'aux innocents
Aux femmes qui chantent en pilotant
Le but, coller en une phrase les ingrédients de l'extase
On sait peu de choses qu'on ignore
Tout corbeau ne fini pas rossignol
Métaphore métaphysique, métamorphose du bruit en musique
On pousse nos crew et stars
Vous n'êtes pas monsieur Starr?

Bien fait a la fête
Enfoirés

Nous naissons tous fous avec une vie pour guérir
Tant qu'une belle vérité reste à conquérir
Trouver l'idée qui marche deux cent ans
L’impression de le faire en plaisantant
Accueillis comme des clowns pas drôles
A la profonde parole des puits de pétrole
Avant que la fortune soit subite
Tous les génies étaient stupides
Couver le feu dans la glace qu'on s'y réunisse;
Des fois; excusez nous la réussite
Ceux qui n’aiment pas n’ont qu’à le faire d’abord
Allez mettre plus de dix personnes d’accord

Artiste c'est pas difficile
On essaie de faire un pull avec dix ficelles
Tu peins des chansons à la décibel
Pour trouver ce truc qui nous la rend si belle

Artiste c'est pas difficile
On essaie de faire un pull avec dix ficelles
Tu peins des chansons à la décibel
Trouver cette chose qui nous la rend si belle

Il faut plus que des qualités
Pour modestement changer l'Humanité
Devenir la première personne des singuliers
Se passe rarement de façon régulière
Et de l’œuvre, comment chiffrer la valeur
Lors qu’à table le succès devient l'avaleur?
Le suspense des prochains loyers
Peut causer des problème de loyauté
Artiste être droit dans ses bottes
Être des trois sur dix milles, et garder ses potes
Pouvoir rebondir en abondance
En gardant votre sourire et puis tant qu’on danse

Artiste c'est pas difficile
On essaie de faire un pull avec dix ficelles
Tu peins des chansons à la décibel
Pour trouver ce truc qui nous la rend si belle

On essaie de faire un pull avec dix ficelles
Tu peins des chansons à la décibel
Trouver cette chose qui nous la rend si belle

Exister grâce à quelques fans
Pas de milliers d’amis ni de centaines de femmes
Une vie de famille acrobatique
Artiste, c'est pour ça qu'elle t'aime et puis te quitte
La peur d'être archivé parce qu’on fait moins bien
Appartenir au passé d'un succès lointain
Y mettre toute son âme et si c'est nul
Comprenez que les critiques soient malvenues
Le temps guette, les nouveaux arrivent
Tant de poissons vont s’y ronger la griffe

Artiste c'est pas difficile
On essaie de faire un pull avec dix ficelles
Tu peins des chansons à la décibel

Oxmo Puccino,"J'ai grandi sur une île sans mer, aux vagues sèches et grises
Sur les hauteurs, je flottais en visant les autres rives
Des globules métissés circulent dans les artères bouchées
Du cannibale, aux mille pattes métallique roulant dans ses bouches
Qui à l'aube crachent des gens qui baillent, et les mangent aux heures de pointe
Les titis n'ont pas le temps de leur ville, les passants viennent de loin
Nous, dès qu'on veut profiter d'elle un peu la vie se complique
Courir sans la forme olympique, vous trace le regard oblique
À force de pression constante, la tension va s'estomper
Par imprudence des gens qui s'aiment, sans gare, se laissent tomber
Je démontre un escargot à la coquille dure à pénétrer
Mais le monstre est beau, à chaque retour, vous reconnaîtrez

Une créature de bitume, sa voix ferrée te crie dessus
Chuchote au marteau piqueur, les petits coeurs sont des fissures
Le temps se divise par quatre dans son oesophage
C'est lui la bête mais c'est nous qui sommes en cage
Sans changer de taille il grossit au risque
De serrer sa ceinture jusqu'à déchirer le périphérique
À part sur l'avenue tu feras pas dix mètres sans toucher le mur
Ou, sans qu'on te bouscule face aux fourmis, tu te sens ridicule
Après tout, que serait Batman sans Gotham ?
Quand le monstre s'assombrit, que les sourires diminuent
C'est à cause des gratte-ciels que les nuages éternuent
Alors l'orage gronde et la foudre précède un...

Même dans ses rares passages, le soleil sait se faire beau
La chaleur accueillie, telle un joli fardeau
Magistrale au mois de mai, la joie devient capitale
À demi nues sur les terrasses, les fraîcheurs sont admirables
Les quais sont florissants, inondés de coulées vertes
Chaque rencontre se change en amicale découverte
Agrippés aux ailes des bateaux mouches
Dans les parcs on pique-nique en chantant

Accoster Lille, Lyon d'amitié
Grimpons le Montpellier, à k'navo

Le marteau casse, la plume est perçante

Oxmo Puccino,"Hey poto qu'est-ce tu fous?
Viens le temps d'une chanson on en a rien à foutre
Coincés par nos femmes ou otages des gosses
Qu'on aime comme des fous quand on peut le faire
Avec tout ce qu'on n'a pas négocié
On va penser qu'on est imparfait
Embrasser l'incertitude
Tant qu'on souffle, se moquer des inquiétudes 
Je trace un texte pas fléché 
Laisse-moi tranquille, on part pêcher

Les potos, les potos, les potos

Ce soir poussons la chansonnette
J'ai moins besoin d'amour que de gens honnêtes
Réglé le féminin solitaire dans l'âme 
Les hommes pleurent dans l'ombre
Déterminant prendre son temps sur l'ongle 
Regarde les arbres
On se voit peu mais on se voit bien
Entre nous pas de social comédien 
Allez verse le bon vin
T'occupe de c'est combien

Les potos, les potos, les potos

Se rappeler la moindre des choses
Pour le maximum de conséquences 
Fort en présence de potes posés avec le silence comme défense 
On s'adore avec nos faiblesses 
Un poto qui ment fait des promesses
Dans le cœur toujours à bord 
Se rendre à l'évidence, passé l'âge des shorts
Que c'est les potos d'abord

Oxmo Puccino,"Slow life
Dorénavant je suis dans la slow life 
Au prix de la chair humaine, prendre son temps n'a rien de trop naïf
Tellement d'enfoirés foncent droit vers le mur
Qu'il va falloir en construire un autre moins dur
Afin de ne pas comparer son malheur au suivant
Il faut décider d'être heureux de son vivant
Le boulot fini, honorée la quittance 
Pense à l'horizon en séparant les distances
La slow n'est pas la no life, sors tes antennes, capte
Respire un peu, écoute ce cœur battre
Faire la différence entre le lieu et l'espace
Spectateur de sa vie au mieux c'est l'extase

Slow life

Les MCs font pas de slow motion 
Ils craignent qu'on les comprenne loin de mes hautes notions
Dans le propos pluridimensionnel 
Mes mentors sont d'exception ascensionnelle
Un conseil à voir venir des moments meilleurs 
Semer quelques souvenirs, devenir le cueilleur
Finies les journées dictées par l'écran tactile
Pour livrer la pensée à des visions fertiles
Deux heures au téléphone avec Kim Chapiron
Tapis rouge, le monde change à tatillon
Adopte la slow life, tu le vivras bien
Quelquefois gagner du temps ne vibre à rien

Slow Life

À cheval sur une tortue j'arrive au galop
Depuis que la mort tue faut y aller mollo
Slow life, tête-à-tête entre lovers vendredi soir, cocktails c'est la slow life
Bonjour les vacances, allume le barbecue, chill, c'est la slow life
De l'audace contre le burn out
Un bon dodo, plus de yeux au beurre noir
Guerrier pacifique patient de ceux qui chuchotent 
Laisse-toi flirter, lâche-toi mais pas si vite
Fais pause, oublie la taille et la performance
D'après les détails c'est au centre que ça recommence
J'ai trouvé un mot qui rime avec plutôt riche
Mais je le garde au frais pour quelques nuits torrides

Slow Life",Slow life,2015
Oxmo Puccino,"Il paraît que t'es une star quand tu passes à la télé
Signes des autographes, aux smartphones photos classes
On bosse à découvert pour divertir du mirage
Et appartenir au quidam, ce travail exige un visage
Garder le sourire peu importe l'état
Quand on serre plus de mains qu'une poignée de puerta
Des salles pleines de joie, des suites six étoiles
Deux heures à dormir et c'est pas chez toi
Froid dans le bain de foule, faut décroiser les regards
Caché derrière des lunettes, seul quand il est tard

Star et célébrité

Privilège imaginaire pour bonne copie
Au fond on reste n'importe qui
Un pas de travers si tu as trop brillé 
Ta tristesse devient inappropriée 
La différence entre salaire et chiffre d'affaires
On s'en fiche des larmes de millionnaire
Faire un peu d'argent, quelquefois perdre beaucoup

Quoi que t'en dises, demande au commissaire
Les artistes sont souvent les boucs émissaires

Star et célébrité

Prise de recul à petits pas
Changement de pays par appétit d'anonymat

Telle une délivrance 
Toutes ces nouvelles reconnections évidentes

Oysterband,"In the middle of the journey, in the middle of the day 
I came to a city and I stopped to ask the way 
What does it matter? Said the people with a sneer 
You can't get there from here 

You may be a gallant runner, you may hobble with the lame 
There are forty crooked hedgerows and they all look just the same 
Traveling gets weary, you get funny in the head 
Stop right here instead 

Well, says I, I was only passing through 
I'd like to stop and rest a while, it's true 
Then I asked them for a job to do 
They gave me life insurance and a straw to chew 

Welcome to the flatlands 
All the maps agree 
Far as the eye can see 
It's level, dead level 
Flatlands: life meanders by 
Chew a straw and watch the grass grow high 

And it's stand we stand together, fall you fall alone 
Authority's a leash of love to bring you safely home 
Fools look out for trouble where foreign breezes blow 
Tell your children so 

They've got to keep things ticking, they must never go on strike 
They'll be standing there till Doomsday with their fingers in the dyke 
There's faith and hope and patience and patience is the best 
Turn your face from the rest 

Well, says I, I'm much obliged to you 
Everywhere I go I'm learning something new 
If I understand your point of view 
You don't believe we're dying our whole life through 

Welcome to the flatlands... 

And if they waste nothing they can keep their little pile 
And if they say nothing they will not be on file 
And if they see nothing no one will see them 
No one will take down their name 

And if they do not panic the pain will vanish soon 
And if they never sing they'll never be out of tune 
And if they are faithful they will get their reward 
And if they are meek they will be spared 

Well, says I, I was only passing through 
I'd better get a move on 'cause the days are few

Is it true what you hear, did he do it out of fear? 
Was the day drawing near when a child would start to show? 
Was it rage or shame or damage to his name? 
Was it something worse, does anybody know? 

Did she pay a price for making them look twice? 
Like a glimpse of paradise across a dull and bitter land? 
Did she pass them by, did she dare to meet their eye? 
Did she scorn them all and did they understand? 

A grief to her father -did she really leave him? 
a lover to her brother -yes we all believe him 
temptation to her betters -no better than she should be 
unfaithful to her lover -he always new she would be

My time was short, the story long 
No I never had a chance to prove them wrong 
It's always them that write the song 

Did he go to ground, was the suitcase ever found? 
Did the police come swarming round on a trail already cold? 
Did he lead them a dance, did he run away to France? 
Or did he shop himself before the day was old? 

O she was bound to loose if she set her face to choose 
They never could excuse her for stirring up their fears 
She was much to young, the earth has stopped her tongue

Oysterband,"What we wanted was chain lightning
What we wanted was 8 miles high
What we wanted was free fall
And our turn to fly

What we wanted was more fireworks
Everlasting 4th of July
What we wanted was more stars
In a bluer sky

All we wanted was something worth it
Worth the labor, worth the wait
Then they take you up to the mountain
You see too late

In the middle of a good time
Truth gave me her icy kiss
Look around, you must be joking
All that way, all that for this

What we wanted was consolation
The band of strangers, help for pain
What we wanted was to be sure
No friends were lost in vain

What we wanted was aggravation
A good cause and a bigger row
What we wanted was the whole plantation
Now, now, now

What we wanted was rhyme and reason
What we wanted was another way
What we get is a tin-pot heaven
And we're too drunk to pray

What we get is the old machinery
Grinding on in the same old way
What we need is the sweet republic
Roll on Independence Day

They brought prosperity, down at the armoury

I kept the faith and I kept voting, 
Not for the iron fist, but for the helping hand 
Theirs is a land with a wall around it 
And mine is a faith in my fellow man 
Theirs is a land of hope and glory 
Mine is the green field and the factory floor 
Theirs are the skies all dark with bombers 
Mine is the peace we knew between the wars 

Call up the craftsmen, bring me a draughtsman 
Build me a path from cradle to grave 
And I'll give my consent to any government

Oysterhead,"He always liked to paint with his sunglasses on 
Cause acrylics tend to burn on his eyes
And nothing brought him closer to the canvas 
Then the warmth of Eleanor's thighs
He never had much of a devious nature
But was hardly a modern day saint
If you asked the little boy what he'd be when he grew up 
Said I'd rather be a fireman then paint
Keep on painting 
She always liked to dance with no shoes on
Cause the gravel felt good on her toes
And Mr. Merriweather left his wife and his kids
In search of a polka dot rose
They never thought much of his mongrelesque stature
Or the scent that could make a buzzard faint
If you asked the little boy what he'd be when he grew up
He'd say
Keep on painting",Polka Dot Rose,2001

If little giant gaudy laying niggas down at the homey's party
Always be goin crazy I guess we are being who we are

When the judge checks his  supper, its so small.

And the hills are grey with trouble and the dry spring gathers dust.

Your lover's crying in the valley, she lost her trust.

But there is a road to glory, somehow headin' in the past,

Behind the gold, behind the treasure, behind the mask.

Then comes a team of four white horses, and a lady with night black hair.

And she looks to be such a fine one, but is she really there?

if you look me in the eye, I'm gonna look right back

and I'm a rich boy, I'm a son of a buck

if I win all your money, I'm gonna yell tuff luck



tuff luck, that's what I'd say

tuff luck, I got to have my way

tuff luck,

well I'm a red hot, I'm a love too

if you see me comin', then I'm comin' for you

but I'm long gone, I can't get stuck

If you look for me baby, I'm gonna yell tuff luck



tuff luck, that's what I'd say

tuff luck, I've got to leave today

lately I've felt a little crazy
like I do when that moon's gettin' full
is there a change in the air or the way that I care
how can I explain how I feel
 
wish I knew me better
and I would if I half-tried
 
but my will is strong and it just carries me on
following the way that I feel
no my love ain't dead it just got to my head
and I need a little space to feel free
(GUITAR SOLO)
 
lately, I've gone a lot of places
and seen a lot of things I didn't need to see
maybe I followed a star a little bit too far
and lost something along the way
 
or maybe I needed to lose
something I shouldn't have had
but it feels so good to take a second look
following the way that I feel
no my love ain't dead it just got to my head
and I need a little space to feel free
(GUITAR SOLO)
 
I feel loose and contented
like to go where I want, when I can
if I set too much, my thoughts begin to rush
and nothin' is clear that I hear
 
I guess I'm a mover
just travelin' through my life to somewhere
 
but it feels so good to take a second look
following the way that I feel
no my love ain't dead it just got to my head
and I need a little space to feel free
while following the way that I feel
 
while I'm following,
following the way that I feel
while I'm following,
following the way that I feel

In the streetlight while I'm walking

I hear voices, someone talking

When I listen, no affection

Something missing, no direction



Ooooh... Every moment

We have wasted, there is nothing

Ooooh... In the distance

Through the wreckage, I hear something

Oh... Love is calling

Oh... Love is calling me home



On the way home through the raindrops

Up the stairway, to the rooftop

There's a silence getting louder

It's just another day without her



Ooooh... I'm a stranger

Under neon, never knowing

Ooooh... In the distance

There's a river, and it's flowing

Oh... Love is calling

Oh... Love is calling me home

(GUITAR SOLO)



In the firelight, by the fountain

In the desert, on the mountain

There's a lost one, someone reach him

There's a last one, someone teach him



Oh... Love is calling

Oh... Love is calling me home

Oh... Love is calling

Oh... Love is calling me home

Like playing music, but you never sing

Ooh, Jackie Blue
Making wishes that never come true
Going places that you've never been
Ooh, Jackie Blue, you're going again

Ooh, Jackie Blue
Lives a dream that can never come true
Making love is like sifting through sand
Ooh, Jackie, it slips through your hand

Every day, in your indigo eyes
I watch the sunset but I don't see it rise
Moonlight and stars in your strawberry wine
You'd take the world but you won't take the time

Ooh-hoo-hoo, Jackie Blue
Lives her life from inside of a room
Makes you think that her life is a drag
Ooh Jackie, what fun you have had

Ooh, Jackie
Ooh, Jackie
Ooh, Jackie
Ooh, Jackie
Hey, hey, hey, hey",Jackie Blue [Rerecorded],
Ozelen,"Uh, hmm
Hurry up a bit
Yeah, yeah

[Chorus: Repeat x3]
I like the way you do it, when you do it
When you doin, what you doin

Check this out right here, son
We about to move to make you feel some
A lot of positive vibrations to build from
Cause all I wanna do is lose some and win some
Have a little of prosperity and then some
Livin my life handsome, has always been a dream but
Now it's time to really achieve by all means (Bust it)
I keep my shit, plus thirty in between
When an arm reach out to grab the supreme
Cause I won't stop, and AP won't stop
And Tab won't stop until we reach the top
That means we won't quit, so we stay thick so you can enjoy it
I know you like the way it's goin down, honey, honey
I know you like the milky-mellow sound, honey, honey
Doin this ain't all about money, money
I know you like the way I sound, right, right

[Chorus: Repeat x4]

As I enter the room I absorb the mood
Positive vibe supplied by a positive crew
And negativity exist and you must acknowledge
You can be intelligent and never go to college
Cause the way we live in society
It ain't really the way that it's supposed to be
And don't get close to me if you're contaminated
Take a picture of your soul and get it laminated
Put them in your wallet next to your money
Money represents your whole and soul represents your honey
Ain't got honey then you ain't got bees
And if you ain't got no money I'ma still MC
Then empty L-O-V-E all over the track
Once you R-E-D then you never go back
'Til the end of studio with the Peas as Black
With Adam, Taboo, and alligator APL De AP

[Chorus: Repeat x4]

I wanna travel the world and stop on every city
Rejuvenate your burnt out sea put down your Philly for a sec
Close your eyes and don't fret
Listen to the audible sounds and just let
Your soul feel the free feelin
Reprovide you with the ride, free fallin
To make your heart beat, skip, hypnotize you and
APL take you on a trip where your mind's at ease
Forget ballin 'cause I won't quit, and Will won't quit
And Tab won't quit so you can enjoy it
That means we won't stop
And I won't stop until we reach the top
I'd rather be ready for the future
Do it for yourself 'cause no one else will suit ya
I juxtapose for mine to maintain
And segregate myself from evil and pain

Oye, los tiempos cambiaron 
Ya las cosas no son iguales 
Y la verdadera situación es que ya
Nadie corre por la de nadie 
Aquí te presento a Los Menores 

Salgo pa' la calle siempre con dos peines largos 
En los bolsillos siempre con dos pacas ando 
Con un combo de locos que no están jugando 
Andamos sin miedo y por eso 

Salgo pa' la calle siempre con dos peines largos 
En los bolsillos siempre con dos pacas ando 
Con un combo de locos que no están jugando 
Andamos sin miedo y por eso 

Como me busco la grasa, las cubetas de hielo que tengo en casa 
Están al tope, por que lo que consumen no lo rechazan 
Desenmoño el tope de menta, en billetes de cincuenta 
Y tú comprando treinta y uno que no cocinan palenta

Yo sé que les da depre saber to' lo que facturo 
Porque viven del menudo, es que mi pauta está en Neptuno 
Te caes si tu me miras, omar está en la calma china 
O tener mira bajaron las F negras en campanilla 

Compramos los mickey de 100 que son pa' la glopeta 
Si aprietan van a correr tú y tú mujer en chancletas 
Pa' la pilla, aquí van de raja pa' la silla 
Tengo el money, como dicen los Domis eso a ti te quilla' 

Frabián, aquí se descarta todo el que coopera 
Yo les paro el explorer sin tu antena, tres letras 
La vuelta y crema, andamos disfrazados de unidad fea
Un arresto, te secuestro, y vas de rabo a la candela 

Papi yo me busco el peso, pregúntale a Omi 
Tengo money en par de países, loco un par de Shorties 
Ahora tengo par de pesos en efectivo 
Me mantienen vivos, los billetes se llevan conmigo 

Benjamin es mi mejor amigo, Jackson es mi primo 
Washington mi compadre y fui a la escuela con Lincoln 
Revolucionario como Duarte en Santo Domingo 
I'm a king, en puertorro Luis Muñoz Marín 

Yo siempre he sido un soñador, quise ser compositor 
Luego me convertí en cantautor 
Quería ser un liricista, puñeta artista 
Y me convertí en inversionista 

Al envidioso digo Tranquilo Bobby 
Matarte es mi hobby, en el crotch como Kobe 
Pa' las mujeres soy seguro un orgasmo 
Duro y dulce, me llaman el durazno 

Salgo pa' la calle siempre con dos peines largos 
En los bolsillos siempre con dos pacas ando 
Con un combo de locos que no están jugando 
Andamos sin miedo y por eso 

Salgo pa' la calle siempre con dos peines largos 
En los bolsillos siempre con dos pacas ando 
Con un combo de locos que no están jugando 
Andamos sin miedo y por eso 

Hacen reuniones pa' setiarme, dicen que quieren cazarme 
Mamenme en el bicho, de ninguno voy a dejarme 
Aborrecido, harto de odio, damos fuego con los palos también 
Que pasó? no te gusto? yo no soy un billete de 100 

To' van pal casco, pa' que les de asco a los fiscales 
Te vamos a procesar con los metales (rascabolas) 
Y a los títeres de embuste, diles que hagan los ajustes 
Que andamos borrando hocicos con par de fulles 

Baja al trabajo y otro carro que hoy vamos a desmantelar 
que te pillemos en la avenida en su madre se va a cagar 
Esto no es relajo, lambe bicho, demuestre su hombría 
A sangre fría si te agarro, pa te voy a dejar de día 

Puro malianteo, ya salieron Los Menores 
No riegan veneno, pero papi sin cojones a mi me tienen 
Mucha tormenta es lo que viene 
Con música hija de puta es que Ñengo se mantiene, so cabrón 

Ya estoy manso muchachos o ¿quieres ver como me agacho? 
Le engancho el peine a mi macho y sin pensar te la respacho 
Ustedes son queso con nachos pai dime, ¿tú estás borracho? 
Acho en cualquier sentido te esparracho 

Las pacas y los billetes las he visto en purrucha 
Hago todo lo que quiero, y si no quiero escucharte, ya 
Yo mando a regar la voz, los burros estoy dando dos 
Se te adelanto, lo siento lechón, llegó Navidad 

Jingle bells, el panzón como Santa Claus 
Mi pipa y la glock, siempre sujeta en el calzon 
Bebo date un resbalón, que me has dado la impresión 
Que tu tienes mucho combo, pero no con corazón 

Ya Los Menores salen pa' la calle 
Lo más que suenan en la calle vivo se han quedao' 
Las cosas ya no son iguales 
Y del caserío no salen 

Pa hablarte claro, ustedes están dando asco 
Mientras yo ando por ahí, wheeliando en la moto sin casco 
Millonario, cabrón yo estoy tirao' pa' atras 
Lo que cuesta el carro tuyo, vale un canto de mi Four Track 

Soy el terror de muchos, el chamaquito incorregible 
Él que a los 22 tiene 3 casas y convertibles 
Él favorito de la calle, y del genero el más terrible 
Que entierra a los demonios y a los muertos los revive 

Soy yo, el que la sigue llevando 
Él que le han tirao' la mala y como quiera esta matando 
Él Titerito, el que sigue comandando 
De to' ustedes el más que está facturando

Never freeing Mumia regardless of proven innocence

givin shouts in states to sustain my stature
altered chemically, ain't no gimmick behind
the way that I'm designin my rhyme
line for line you'll find in your neighborhood
there's a flavor flood, whether you're a ghetto star
or if your name is mud

and I act rather contagiously

Out the gate I brought the horsepower
Rev-Mex to your hard drive
We run a hard bargain
Pardon the trip

I sneeze jealousies into these rhyme cartel
We park the art well
Hung on all fours, box and start sell
Available to you and yours

Other songs only make attempts
To love they inner
Understand I am just saying it
To validate displaying Ozomatli

Stance at first glance
It's like the train
Brought to hit you like James
With the 1, 2, 3, 4

Official souls my brainchild
Sing the song name now

Bust a track till they flat on they back
Have the referee smacking the mat like
1, 2, 3, 4

We do it on the phone
When we stuff the funk in it, huh

Now wait a minute, so allot of us
Yo, I'm the East Coast south paw
Hanging with these West Coast north stars
Shining bright, height five elev'

Come on

Formatic for the handlin' the trouble
Comin' my way
The highway to heaven
Is a long road among the lyrical coves
The bus

Allot of us
Punk minds with the one of a kind rhymes
I .M.C., spit, kick for fee
Then all, not the player baby
But I running while you crawl

Too fast on your comprehension
Did I mention
Dave Madden scored a goal from the team
Second team I

I'm ready for crunch time
The lunch line was my favorite
Till I graduated to bus
Uh, uh, then I spewed to spit it

Now it's the three of us
Connected like Siameses
We on time
Like shiny bits of metal

Strapped to your wrist
We are tattoo to this rap thing
With invisible ink
I'm gone in a blink

Lethal like my pinkie
And clown like Bozo
Don't you know that Ozo bring the
1, 2, 3, 4

To hard to face
But lovin' the taste
Squeeze it out like paste alright
1, 2, 3, 4

Plug 2 will only rock a few
So now I roll with Ozomatli crew

You are the world

Am I a patriot of the chaos?
Everyday I watch young studs play blocks
In front of buildings, dealing what they gotta
Currency and game exchange
What else?

Souls bought and talked with the father of time
Ask if I'm embracing it, I either wasting it
My mind feel like I'm chasing it
Everyday it gets harder to author a plan
Consult with the Gods 'cause I know they smarter than man

It's hypnotic how the chaotic harbor the land
Through raw metals, slick women, cars and sedans
Guess we all part of the dance in one way or another
The way a man beat his woman, feeling that he love her

They way five children get killed by their mother
Parts of the universe still to discover
The real uncover fake whether love or hate
For revolution, chaos we embrace

It's like I wrote for freedom my God sticks in
You gon' have to tote for freedom, I awoke in the p.m
To let my folks know it's gonna
Be a brighter, there's light that shines on the corner
In the dawn of the chaos, I try not to be
A pawn or a player so nights I stay up

Write words, for me it's like a prayer
Knowing it'll be, I put it in the air
And stare at the emotions of those in the commotion
Hoping it's the chaos that we grow from
Opened a cold one, build with warriors that hold gun
For the same prize, our souls run

From they window, they see no sun
I say, ""Revolution, when he gon' come?""
Yes he came, in way that may seem strange
Only through chaos will we ever see strange

Check it out
The way you feelin on the outside
Reflects how you feelin' on the inside
Tell me now have you really ever stopped tryin
So many people killin
Kids still dyin or multiplyin'
I ain't lyin here's my testimony
The shit I kick is real never ever phony
You spittin cheesy lyrics like macaroni
Call me if you only want to sit down and write a jam
That stands for Somethin'

Because my passion and rage are highly concentrated
This underground music movement is way too underrated
Pop music done came
Had its five seconds of fame
Now it's time to throw a wrench all up in they game

We trek this battlefield life
with words to sleigh the doubters expect no knives
It's only common sense the heart is more revealing
but a stab to someone's back is much more appealing

We trek this battlefield life
with words to sleigh the doubters quitters, cowards
It's only common sense the heart is more revealing
but a stab to someone's back is much more appealing

I know you feel the pain I conceal
Hip hop flip flopped to gain pop appeal
Upon the backs of MC's with integrity
Rap music made wack a celebrity
I ain't worried why be in a hurry
Giant steps are made in inches and snakes tend to scurry
When my steps are taken no room for move fakin'
Your titles exect your visions blurry so hurry hurry
Catch the force of all my fury
I'm growin leaps and bounds from the mound which you been buried
Feed off yo energy
Two times infinity

is just far too complex too far out to be fetched
So as I sketch check my patterns, my shades and tones
Freak in the microphone is yours truly saucer
The dope rhyme flosser
I got something for all you wankers and tossers..
With dollar budget pushing low grade quality
That's like ghost face sportin some no name walabees

Now I be damned if I sit on my ass
While these MCs tresspass cross my grass
Time to landscape
Reshape the garden for growth
Spread the message overseas, via remote

We got different types of flavas but they taste the same
All biters no writers in this hip-hop game
I blame myself plus you for things we do
It's not wonder why we stay under and don't bust through because..

There was never one as fair, lovely as she.
With sun soaked skin and eyes of green, 
With all kindness and grace of a queen.
I set sail into a cold, dark sky. 
I had to see this beauty with my own eyes.
I crossed the ocean in a tiny ship 
With her image in my mind and her name on my lips. I set.

I found her standing upon the shore.
She was everything I dreamed of and so much more.
I felt a love that I've never known 
And I knew I had to make her my own.
She was light of the night. She was dark as the night. 
I fell under her spell, couldn't tell wrong from right.
I set.

She breathed new life inside of me. 
A whole new world she gave to me. 
Surrendered all she had to me, 
Even silver and gold. 
All she asked was my soul.

How could I've know I'd been hypnotized. 
There was more to my queen than first met the eye. 
She had a chain of lovers who died her slaves 
With a notion of blood for every drop that she gave. 

I never thought she could break my heart 
But all her contradictions are tearing me apart.

The beauty she flaunts

What I can give is not enough to help him grow. 
How can I fulfill his needs, embrace his soul?

[Chorus]
The hope deep in his eyes are dreams he must let fly! 
So sing this song with me. 
This hopeful melody.

Just raise your head up and stand up, no fear in your eyes. 
Tell me love and hope never die. 
So raise your head up and stand up, no reason to cry. 
Cause your heart and soul will survive.

The child struggled to survive. Now he's a man. 
With children of his own, he does the best one can. 
He tries to live with love and not let sorrow grow, 
Even though he barely reaps all that he sows.

From raised fist to sit in
Resist to change shit
Peep this scenario
To the future, bro

People rose up
Governments froze up
World-wide block party
Everybody shows up
Up on rooftops
Ghettos and hot spots
People celebrate
No more souls rot
No more bloodshed over false deficit
Even hip hop gets a fuckin' face lift

Give plaques & charms to writers of wack poems
Divided attacks, tryin' to collapse this platform
In this rap, we detach from any distraction

Yes, sever the head of the evil music(meant to divide & confuse kids) the media spoon-feeds you
People who need you concede to your bluffin'
Parasitic poison unfit for human consumption
Why they focus on one of they crusades

While most of human life is as fragile as loose eggs
Vatican they paid for they role in the slave trade
So how can you place blame on the hate that hate made?
Secret political interests hide from view

You police the planet, but who protects us from you?

Rollin' single-file like wheels on rollerblades

'Cause the man who fails to plan really plans to fail, for real
Flows they close and do stunts 'cause all they want's the wit of your ignorance
To bury a man's sanity can it be so simple?

Todayâ??s medics, genetically grown people
And where we had it pathetic where citizens give up their civil liberties
To officers of evil intent & devilish tendencies
While enemies join forces to endorse this mental extortion gone corporate

When will the corporate forfeit morbid acts on the helpless?
Ignoring facts 'til they selfish aristocrats who flex well in the time where sex sells
Their crime rhymes melt kids' minds like soft snails
Either you end up in jail or caught shells

But time blinds, help kids find their thoughts well, for real
The media's how they get too attached
To violent images permanent like Yakuza tattoos
They got shoes, relax the underwear
While adult messages traumatize the younger ear

As deep as your pockets and use logic
The words kill before you have time to breathe
What the ears hear & the eyes see, the mind believes

While they hang you from your ankle and they take what falls
Citizens of this planet deserve a wake-up call
He who hides knowledge controls this grand scheme
In the land of the blind, the one-eyed man is king.

Ozomatli,"Every night I'm dreaming
Of a new and better world
But I feel the cancer
Taking over me

Inside I'm screaming
My chest is about to burst
I feel so powerless
Against this mental prison

Everyday I'm getting stronger
I feel ten feet tall right now
Every night I feel I'm about to fail
No one's gonna break my fall
Don't worry, it'll get much better

When I close my eyes
The vision inside me
Comes to life outside
The world's much better now

When the night is falling
Your hope has gone to dust
The creep that hurts you
Will know when it's time to quit

The power inside you 
Let it come and work it out
The strength within you
Will make the sadness disappear

Everyday I'm getting stronger
I feel ten feet tall right now
Every night I feel I'm about to fail
No one's gonna break my fall
Don't worry, it'll get much better

Comes to life outside
And the world's much better now",When I Close My Eyes,2007

The heavyweight in town, mero mero con ganas
I'm mister get whatever, whenever, however
If you be up in my way, chingadasos forever
I run up on this squinkle, cough up your catera
He's shakin in his chonies reachin for his feria
Out the corner of my eye distracted by some nalgas
This little pinche leva kicks me right in the pelotas

I threw my game hard I'm just spittin with no prisas

One day these could be the days but who could have known
Loading in the back of a pickup truck
Riding with the boys and pushing the luck
Singing songs loud on the way to the game
Wishing all the things could still be the same
Chinese home runs over the backstop
Kakua on the ball and soda pop well

We used to laugh a lot
But only because we thought
That everything good always would remain
Ain't nothing gonna change, there's no need to complain

Sunday morning and it's time to go
Been raining all night so everybody knows
Over to the field for tackle football
Big hits, big hats, yeah give me the ball
Rain is pouring, touchdown scoring
Keep on rolling, never boring
Karma, karma, karma chameleon
We're talking kinda funny from helium

We used to laugh a lot
But only because we thought
That everything good always would remain
Ain't nothing gonna change, there's no need to complain

Monday morning and it's time to go
Wet trunks and schoolbooks and sand on my toes
Do anything you can to dodge the bus-stop blues
Like driving a paddle with a burnt-out fuse
My best friend Kimmy wants to go with you
So meet her by the sugar mill after school
My best friend Kimmy wants to go with you

Ella se porta bien pero se porta mal conmigo 
Se suelta el pelo, se transforma 
Me muerde en el cuello, dice que rompemos las normas 
Sin piedad le mete solo tiene 17 
Vive su vida de soltera, no se compromete 
No tiene hora de llegada 
A su padre se le hace buena, conmigo es nena mala 

Qué hay de malo el querer besarte 
Cada mañana despertar contigo 
Qué hay de malo el poder tenerte 
No quiero ser solo tu amigo

Ya pasaron tantas noches que no sé de sufrimiento 
Que los días se hacen largos 
No puedo estar sin ti 
Y ahora yo salgo pa' la calle 
A buscar un nuevo amor que llene mi corazón 
Y que no me falle, baby 

No quiero amores
No vengas con tu traición 
Las penas yo las olvido con alcohol 
Solo yo la paso mejor

Tu juego se acabo, fuiste tú la que apagó la ilusión 
Buscándome ahora, ya no
Periódico de ayer se fue lo último que quedó 
Aunque muera por estar en tus brazos 
Vete lejos que así es mejor 

No quiero nada contigo 
Solo la paso mejor 
Eres amor prohibido y tú lo sabes, bebé

Desde que no estás yo estoy mejor 
Sé que por las noches te hace falta mi cariño, mi calor, 
Baby ya no quiero nada contigo 
El tiempo pasado para mi eso fue tiempo perdido
Por estar celando ahora estás sola 
Otra mamasita en la casa controla 
Cuando ves mi foto yo sé que tú te incomodas 
Porque estoy al día y soy el nuevo chamaquito de la moda 

No quiero nada contigo 
Solo la paso mejor 
Eres amor prohibido y tú lo sabes, bebé

No quiere saber na' de mí
Ay, dime qué fue lo que yo hice mal 
Te pusieron en contra de mí 
Al que fue, no se lo voy a perdonar 

Ahora dice que no me conoce, no no no no no 
Y si me ha visto se supone que en el pasado fue 
Yo si me acuerdo cómo lo hacíamos 
Cómo en la cama nos matábamos (Let go, come on)

Ahora dice que no me conoce, no no no no no 
Y si me ha visto se supone que en el pasado fue 
Yo sí me acuerdo cómo lo hacíamos 
Cómo en la cama nos matábamos 

Sé que te pasas negando, todo lo que tú y yo hacíamos 
Queda en tu mente grabado todas las veces que nos desvestíamos 
Ahora me paso pensando, cómo tú puedes vivir así 
Diciendo que no sabes lo que entre sábanas tú te entregaba a mí

Solo yo, he podido llegarle 
Tu cuerpo sabe elevarse 
Y cuando tus piernas temblaban 
No decía nada ya no

Dialogando con el dinero 
No quiero interrupciones 
Esa es la prioridad 
Pasaste lista de opciones 
Estoy con la colombiana, que sepa mañana y la cubana llega a Paris 
Llámate al ruso, que baje los kilos de oro que llegan a la calle de Brasil 

Solo yo he podido llegarle 
Tu cuerpo sabe, elevarse 
Y cuando tus piernas temblaban 
No decía nada, nada no no

Ahora dice que no me conoce, no no no no no 
Y si me ha visto se supone que en el pasado fue 
Yo sí me acuerdo cómo lo hacíamos

Y ahora dice que no me conoce, no no no no no 
Y si me ha visto se supone, que en el pasado fue 
Yo sí me acuerdo cómo lo, hacíamos 
Cuando en la cama nos matábamos (J Balvin man)

Por más que me niegues a mí, no puedes escaparte 
Si era tu luz de mi sombra y me seguías a todas partes 
Nos lograron separar, tú no quisiste escuchar 
Fue más importante qué dijo la gente, que a dónde podíamos llegar 

En el mundo de mí están hablando 
Diciendo mil cosas 
Que me ven por aquí, que me ven por allá 
Por mi vida famosa 
Tú me conoces de años atrás, sabes cómo es la cosa 
Tú sabes que yo soy real 
Te lo dije una vez

Y sé que nuestro amor es periódico de ayer 
Que tú no lo quieres leer, que ni por la calle tú me quieres ver 
Si sales de party me escuchas a mí, siempre te preguntan por mí baby 
Dime qué se siente ser el fantasma que te atormenta a ti 

Dime que pasó mami, todo iba normal 
Te hablaron de mí, te dejastes llevar 
Tu cuerpo me estaba empezando a amar 
Y por culpa de la gente, ahora te toca olvidar 

Yo sé que eres infeliz, pero te pasas mintiendo 
Fingiendo que eres feliz, mami yo no te entiendo 
Ahora él te pone a llorar, también te pone a sufrir 
Mientras yo te ponía a viajar, yo linda te hacía lucir 

Solo yo he podido llegarle 
Tu cuerpo sabe elevarse 
Y cuando tus piernas temblaban 
No me decía nada nada no no

Ahora dice que no me conoce, no no no no no 
Y si me ha visto se supone que en el pasado fue 
Yo sí me acuerdo cómo lo hacíamos 
Cómo en la cama nos matábamos 

Y ahora dice que no me conoce, no no no no no

Llama a su amiga, no le gusta salir sola
Y de la noche, dejarse llevar, oh oh oh

Mami, tu cuerpo una bendición
Pero me da una mala intención
Contigo quiero entrar en acción
Venga bailemos esta canción
Caliente, así se pone cuando el ritmo lo siente
Y no le importa que la mire toa' la gente
No dice nada pero su cara no miente
Yeah eh eh (yeah, The Remix)

Se pone caliente cuando escucha este perreo
Y yo también me pongo caliente si la veo
Ella es tan bonita, por ahí tan solita
Con esa cinturita, bailándome cerquita (Ozuna)

Muévete ma' que la rumba empieza
Pero no lo pares, dale con certeza
Que tu amiga admire su naturaleza
Pa' asegurarse, me jala la mano y me besa
Muchachita, muy bonita colombianita
Eres lo que el negro necesita
Chiquita te me agarras por la cinturita
Y te me pegas, mami

Vamos a bailarlo como que se acabe el mundo hoy
Tú a mí me miras a los ojos y ya sabes lo que doy
Vamos a bailarlo como que se acabe el mundo hoy
Tú a mí me quieres y yo te quiero pero solamente hoy (Señores, Terminator)

Baby un, dos, tres, báilame otra vez
Le pregunto si quiere, me dice (Yes, yes)
Amigos y novios a la vez, hoy es noche de sex
Vamos a escaparnos un mes
Perreo, someteo, me caliento si te veo
Al noviecito tuyo, yo no se la creo
El rompe bocinas, te pillo en la esquina
Baby ponte fina, llegó el que te domina
Yo sé que tú, le das duro, contra el muro
Baby, sácame de apuro, cianuro
Perreo del duro y ella me grita (Papi dame duro)

Se pone caliente cuando escucha este perreo
Y yo también me pongo caliente si la veo
Ella es tan bonita, por ahí tan solita
Con esa cinturita, bailándome cerquita (Yandel)

Yeah yeah
Me pongo caliente, cuando bailando la veo
Con esa carita bonita hace que yo coja vuelo
De esta rumba tú no te vas
Dile a tu amiga que si se va
Que nos deje sola en una nota loca
Así te quiero pa’ mí na' más
Se ve atractiva y a la vez adictiva
Como que le gusta el peligro 
Yo la tengo en la mira

Ayo
Que se preparen pa' la fiesta
Que la cintura, darle vela
Ma', pégate al frente y que suba esa tela
Que esto está afinca'o hasta que a ti te duela
Tú eres mi bebé, no te me salgas de al frente
Báilalo fuerte ¿qué importa la gente?
Algarete, no importa la gente
To' eso es pa' mí, bailando te di fuete
No hay más na', te diré
Y esto no para hasta que estés sin conciencia
Que quite la paciencia y te sueltes las piernas
Hoy vamo' a meterte
Chula, tú tienes esa adicción que me pone y me tiene

Se pone caliente cuando escucha este perreo
Y yo también me pongo caliente si la veo
Ella es tan bonita, por ahí tan solita
Con esa cinturita, bailándome cerquita

Mami quiero verte, me tienes daña' la mente
Del uno al diez, yo te doy veinte
Pa’ que te deleites, un remix del perreo bien fuerte
Y no importa que no sea decente
Mami, te quiero cerquita
Tocándote el pelo y esa cinturita
Te ves tan bonita y a la vez loquita
Pues yo soy tu loco en tu juego de diablita (J Balvin)

Ella pide que la toque, a veces que la bese
Me manda razones, que cuando amanece
Está bien encendía, la tengo en la mira
Fiera de noche, una santa de día
Baby, el ritmo se adueña de tu piel
A ti te gusta y a mí también
Que nos pasemos las noches dándole
Baby, el ritmo se adueña de tu piel
A ti te gusta y a mí también
Que nos pasemos las noches dándole

Quiere enamorarse y no se decide 
Después de bajar el cielo y no hay quien la obligue 
Caíste y es difícil que tú la olvides

Eres caliente, en tu mirada lo noto
Tu cuerpo es la nave
Y en este caso especial, yo vengo siendo el piloto, yeah
En el espacio de tu ser me quiero perder
Y aprender todos los secretos que esconde tu piel, yeah
Quisiera ver contigo un nuevo amanecer
No en la tierra si no en el aire a 30 mil pies
Atrévete, yo voy a ti, deja la timidez
Y vas a ver como de nuevo querrás otra vez
Asómate por la ventana y dime qué ves
Sólo nubes blancas y una vida sin estrés (Remix)

Ok, que tal si baby yo te busco en el europeo
Que tengo medio phillie ya en el cenicero
Relájate, que te acaricien lo' asiento' de cuero
Te hablo claro, tú sabes que yo te soy sincero
Te veo triste y también un poco perdida
Será por los problemas que has pasado en tu vida
Escápate conmigo, vacaciones extendidas
Pa' recorrer el mundo desde Egipto a Argentina
No quiero que esto vaya a terminar
Quiero que te quedes un poquito más
Tú eres algo que yo no puedo olvidar
Y contigo yo me vuelvo a escapar

Hoy voy a buscarte pa' matar las ganas
Tu cuerpo y tu alma me llama
Me tiran la mala porque la que no gana, siempre difama

Porque antes era inútil como un iPhone 7 que no tiene chip
Quieren hundirme el barco en el que vamo' juntos
Y yo que soy un experto en el Battleship
Soy un player, tú eres mi championship
Quiero darte besos, 
quiero como darte todos los días, tenemos un partnership
Que nadie se meta más que dañe la relationship
Hoy me vestí de blanco, todo blanco pa' ti
Me bañé del perfume que te gusta
Escápate conmigo y quítate la ropa
Que desnudos vamos a grabar un feat

Mi vida ahora se basa en la monotonía
Mi mente reproduce días donde te tenía
Y aunque te pedía no soltarme de la mano
Tus dedos eran suaves como las teclas de un piano
Todavía no me acostumbro y eso que ha pasado el tiempo
Pero no hay manera de que lo supere

A mi corazón que te borre pero es que él no quiere

Libreta y lapicero, te dedico otro día
Miro la foto en el muro de como sonreías
Tal vez sea un descuido, si es algo indebido
La pena viene siendo mi uniforme preferido
Me hace falta verte en navidad usar mi abrigo

Donde las sonrisas son las cartas de entrada
Donde tú puedes volar libre y no cortar tus alas

Pero este es mejor porque la vida no se acaba

Donde ya no se sienten penas y temores
Donde uno se sonríe si dicen te quiero

Ozzie the Owl,"The hammering from the pit and the pounding of guns grew louder. My fear rose at the sound of someone creeping into the house. Then I saw it was a young artilleryman, weary, streaked with blood and dirt.

      Artilleryman: Anyone here?
      Journalist: Come in. Here, drink this.
      Artilleryman: Thank you.
      Journalist: What's happened?
      Artilleryman: They wiped us out. Hundreds dead, maybe thousands.
      Journalist: The heat ray?
      Artilleryman: The Martians. They were inside the hoods of machines they'd made, massive metal things on legs. Giant machines that walked. They attacked us. They wiped us out.
      Journalist: Machines?
      Artilleryman: Fighting machines, picking up men and bashing them against trees. Just hunks of metal, but they knew exactly what they were doing.
      Journalist: Hmm. There was another cylinder came last night.
      Artilleryman: Yes. Yes, it looked bound for London.

London! Carrie! I hadn't dreamed there could be danger to Carrie and her father, so many miles away.

      Journalist: I must go to London at once.
      Artilleryman: And me, got to report to headquarters, if there's anything left of it.

At Byfleet, we came upon an inn, but it was deserted.

      Artilleryman: Is everybody dead?
      Journalist: Not everybody, look... 

Six cannons with gunners standing by.

      Artilleryman: Bows and arrows against the lightning.
      Journalist: Hmm.
      Artilleryman: They haven't seen the heat ray yet. 

We hurried along the road to Weybridge. Suddenly, there was a heavy explosion and gusts of smoke erupted into the air.

      Artilleryman: Look! There they are! What did I tell you!

Quickly, one after the other, four of the fighting machines appeared. Monstrous tripods, higher than the tallest steeple, striding over the pine trees and smashing them, walking tripods of glittering metal. Each carried a huge funnel and I realized with horror that I'd seen this awful thing before.
A fifth machine appeared on the far bank. It raised itself to full height, flourished the funnel high in the air, and the ghostly terrible heat ray struck the town.
As it struck, all five fighting machines exulted, emitting deafening howls which roared like thunder:

      Martians: Ulla! Ulla! Ulla! Ulla! Ulla! Ulla!

The six guns we had seen now fired simultaneously, decapitating a fighting machine. The Martian inside the hood was slain, splashed to the four winds, and the body, nothing now but an intricate device of metal, went whirling to destruction. As the other monsters advanced, people ran away blindly, the artilleryman among them, but I jumped into the water and hid until forced up to breathe. Now the guns spoke again, but this time the heat ray sent them to oblivion.
With a white flash the heat ray swept across the river. Scalded, half blinded and agonized, I staggered through leaping, hissing water towards the shore. I fell in full sight of the Martians, expecting nothing but death. The foot of a fighting machine came down close to my head, then lifted again as the four Martians carried away the debris of their fallen comrade, and I realized that by a miracle, I had escaped.

Father of creation takes me from my stolen tomb 
Seventh night the unicorn is waiting in the skies 
A symptom of the universe, a love that never dies

Take my hand, my child of love come step inside my tears 
Swim the magic ocean I've been crying all these years 
When our love will ride away into eternal skies 
A symptom of the universe, a love that never dies 

Yeah 

Oh my child of love's creation, come and step inside my dreams 
In your eyes I see no sadness, you are all that loving means 
Take my hand and we'll go riding through the sunshine from above 
We'll find happiness together in the summer skies of love",Symptom of the Universe,1982
Ozzy Osbourne,"Misty morning, clouds in the sky
Without warning, the wizard walks by
Casting his shadow, weaving his spell
Funny clothes, tinkling bell
Never talking
Just keeps walking
Spreading his magic
Evil power disappears
Demons worry when the wizard is near
He turns tears into joy
Everyone's happy when the wizard walks by
Never talking
Just keeps walking
Spreading his magic
Sun is shining, clouds have gone by
All the people give a happy sigh
He has passed by, giving his sign
Left all the people feeling so fine
Never talking
Just keeps walking
Spreading his magic

Hawk is what the niggas call me, 'cause they all be
Sucking my dick and my mother fucking balls, G
I know the half, so I laugh with 'em
Blood bath when I let the fucking rap hit 'em
Full clip, but only half did 'em,
That's all it took, another crook taken out over a dirty look
I bag game with niggas I leave shot dead
You're not taking a fucking thing from me but hot lead
You know my style, fagot, 'cause I'm always scheming
In Jail, niggas holdin' a sink, screaming
Police! But you got no peace
Yo, was that you, big man, and a lot more grease?
All I gets is pounds, you ain't want none of this
Back streets are like track meets 'cause I be running this

Ain't nowhere to run, ain't nowhere to hide
Ain't nowhere to go, Reaper's saved your soul

Surrounded by the colors, I see crimson, black, and blue
Locking open doors again, I'm still afraid of you
Light to dark, then light again, I always thought I knew
Young to old and young again, what's left for me to do?
Sister of the universe, selecting me in time
I'm falling down upon the Earth and singing truth in rhyme
If I was a rolling stone, I'd roll until I'm through,
And if I was a garden I would bloom in black for you!

There's no walls that you have to climb
This is real, this is elementary, dear, elementary, Watson
Elementary, argh!

You don't want this money till it's rich
Buy my album, coded by Dirty, set you free
Go against the grain, I got the P
I know you don't recognize me now, I done cocooned
How many lightning bolts do it take to light up a fucking moon?
Brothers, people, you'd better get the fuck off of me
We don't need it, it gets more ugly
Fools tryin' to bust their ass,
Tryin' to get away from me when I said my real name
I call myself in the bitch butthole

Feel the love and appreciation from all of my niggas
When I think meditate and contemplate for my soul
Watch the truth manifest once the story unfold
Disloyal motherfuckers I'ma banish you all
And celebrate all in your ? once I get rid of y'all
Sometimes I can't describe the wicked shit I feel in my heart
Break my silence and sporadically tear you apart
Strike with a serious vengeance and before you die
Put you through the worst and make you take a look in my eye!
So you could witness the extreme damage caused by betrayal
Make you sorry for the fact that you attempted and failed!
Make you eternally suffer, you was one of my men's
Turn your back on me, and I'ma make sure you get it back times ten
Stay true, now that's the one thing I religiously pledge
If you ain't wit me I'ma throw you WAY over the edge

Yeah you be the one to run and leave me out in the cold
So amazing how many times you plot and you scheme
But what you don't realize, you'll never conquer my dream
Though devilish karma can't penetrate the steel in my armor
Time passed, my oppression got you living with drama!
Paranoid of my retaliation, living in fear
Disloyalty will have me kill my brother, shedding a tear
Such a shame how you could easily get trapped in a zone
And have to go to war with FAKE niggas standing alone
Until I get with all my loyal niggas going the length
Don't matter how hard you try you never weaken my strength!

Deal with these niggas, let's put them where they properly go
On the Island far away in a place where nobody know

I turned around, I read the writing on the wall

Washed his hands and sealed his fate

I'm a man of wealth and taste
I laid traps for the troubadours
Who get killed before they reached Bombay

Pleased to meet you
Hope you guessed my name
But what's puzzling you
Is the nature of my game, oh yeah

Every cop is a criminal
And all the sinners are saints
Heads is tails just call me Lucifer
I'm in need of some restraint

So if you meet me have some courtesy
Have some sympathy, and taste
Use all your well-learned politesse
Or I'll lay your soul to waste

Pleased to meet you
Hope you guessed my name
But what's puzzling you
Is the nature of my game

What's my name?
What's my name?
What's my name?
I am Lucifer

Alright you motherfuckers
What's my name?
What's my name?
Come on baby, come on baby, come on baby, come on baby

Pleased to meet you
Hope you guessed my name, oh yeah
But what's puzzling you
Is the nature of my game

Change your industrial need
Destroy the soul that you steal, the radiation is real
Beat fate, too late, you built and fueled the fire

Deceived the whole human race

How many more have to die
People dying in masses
Ain't gonna get any by

Our pride
We've crossed through many borders
In between suicides

War, killing sons and daughters
Another failed attack, there is no turning back
Blood, running down like water

Until the judgment comes

I watch the body count rise
Why are the children all marching, Into the desert to die

The human psyche is twisted
The madness rising again
Another aim by a bully
I watch them dying in vain

Defenders of the homeland; our pride
We've crossed through many borders
