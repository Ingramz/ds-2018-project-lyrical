Nigga I really do my thing
Kind of fuckin' hustlers are y'all?

And my homeboy home
Blew an ounce of that kush (Kush)
In my Sean John Jones
I got the mild for the low (Low)
From smokin' plenty optimos
Tryna make a quick flip, like my patna Maceo
I'm shinin' on my haters, signin' deals so I'm a pa
Twenty G's on the chain, and I'm still worth a couple blocks
(all that man, I need a fo, a deuce)
It started in that temp, flippin' mid's by them O-Z's

On the hill wit that shit from a custom border
Two gram, fifties, do the math for a quarter (For a Quarter??)
That's one, I fulfill nigga's order
What you nigga's wanna order?
06' Nino Brown, flip the temp into the carter
Rebirth! don't cut out my four-ways
I stash purp pounds, that's down for the drop days
And for my pay, I hit the trap when the sunrise
I break one down, and the rest goin for the high

I got houses in different continents nigga!
Nigga I did my trips in London, remember that?
Fuck is wrong wit y'all!

I'm the boss of my own shit, I'm the ruling general
Bricks lined up like, cars at a funeral
I'm working hard white, So I never twurk, touch and bust
My workers on the block, So the work ain't even gotta touch
My money come in stacks (Stacks)
And I know just how to get it man
A low profile, might be ridin' a Honda Civic man
You'll never know it's me, but a nigga got the work holmes
I move it all day, think he clirpin' on my chirp phone
Connects so sweet (Sweet)
And I'm dealin' wit tha Caribbeans
They come from cross the water, masked-taped to my Europeans
Supplyin', whole towns, little counters, in the projects
Tryna double my money up, leave the block, wit a profit
For you nigga's that like to pop (Pop)
You know I got them pills too
Getcha you a couple of splitters, have you spinnin' like some wheels fool
This shit don't stop, I move this work clockwise

Spendin' a couple K's up in Stroker's (Right)
Flyin' up Peachtree, racin' in the roster's (The Fast Life!)
I'm so icy, and I think they like me (Like Me)
Seven Jeans saggin', fitted cap and my white tee (I'm Fresh to death!)
The foreign cars got they eyes poppin' (Damn)
And you can see the stars when the ride droppin'

Aye Jim Jones, (What's Hattninnin!)
Let ya boy Parlae get some of that Harlem clientele (What's Hattninnin!)
I got more crack than a curb, Fuck wit me! (Westside! Aye fuck wit me)

And when the show's slow (Show's slow)
I cook extra blow (Extra blow)
Put the whip game on it, get some extra dough (Extra Dough)
Keep the cars pullin' up, like it's Texaco (Texaco)

Damon Elliott,"You niggaz better run
When I grab the gun for homocide
Well you know I'm about to hoo-lah
I never catch you sleeping
And I'mma pop the clip
Put it between your eyes when I should die
Need six feet in a ditch like a bitch
Just avoid the clip with the gauge
Nigga must have had a snipper
They came up pop collar
Hollow point tips to the brain
Bug to the bang I'm stuck in this game
Can't get away cause I'm in too deep
Running the street with heats
Never nigga can hang
You might as well get up and bitch defeat
If a nigga don't know way, know it now
Grab your shit cause it's going down
Fuck one time
Cause I'm on the frontline
Popping slugs with my dogs as we going down
Still hold it ground boy
You know what it is
Hit him in the face with a death kiss
Don't know what his problem was
But all I can say is that a nigga had a death wish
Should have messed with the wrong clique
Saw the nigga drop when I felt the chrome click
That's what you give or talking shit
Now you lying in the hospital
What you don't seek
Here come one in the head
Left it brain dead
Got to put it more life support
Living day by day on the edge of the lens
But he didn't realize that life was short
Now Eazy turning your sleep put your heat
My stars as I match and I creep so cold
You are the wrong nigga to fuck with
So fuck with me best believe it
You gonna reap what you sow
Reap what you sow, sow, sow, sow

Silent night
Deadly night
It's all right
Cause you are dying tonight

Silent night
Deadly night
It's all right
Cause you are dying tonight

I say, bone man here it comes
And then the weaker pumping jumping
Feel your body drubbing
As the weakest pumping jumping
Track his family dawn in him
Nigga the eardrum pumping don't get real
I'm back with the mo thug family
Nigga they creeping they sipping
Motherfucker wanna get rowdy, hardy
Had to fuck top everybody
With my nigga BG in, just stock all me
Back with the gauge in the double glock party
Hardy round for your head
Nigga what you want? Now you are dead
Blood red, blood red this only sign
Should us select the gun right
This only sign, should us select the gun
You wanna fuck with me?
Sit ain't funny when you lie in the bed
Covered up in a coffin
Motherfucker, what's happening?
Wanna fuck up my nigga like septin?
Mo thug gonna put it down rapping
Motherfucker don't stop kill mo bug
I'm down for the world
For bloody
Everybody wanna see me
Be like me, hear me
But you cannot pull down trek like me
Nigga so I just spray and spray
The king all over your ear drum
Till you start to do bleed, eternally thugs
Mo thug much love, right

Behold, better move so scold
Then it is on to fly
Then it will all haul back to my family
Nigga give a shit today
Put the ding and blood out to book
Keep eternal life there
Choose to never repent and camp on fire
Bullet proof this way
Must you prepare for consequences hanging
Soldier don't go to this section, finna get high
My bullets and brimstones
Should leave me alone but no
Such to address Flesh Bone
Make yourself for the ram of death is on
Honey nothing can try
Not as my turn then go trap all enemies
All enemies under my combat look them
Kill them and collect my local ways
???East 1999??? nigga Saint Claire
Sieving for the body body, check to them
Never no close to tuition
Murder when I'm leaving no track
Not for a maniac, it's a shame
Niggaz that feeling the blind
Niggaz they still gone change
Hang the blind go strangle thugs
Go to wreck with the mix man
Ready for rise to rising indeed
Better wait for love of a Pharaoh nothing more
To the creature churn on
Don't pay money on to sacrifice him high
I say that healing you
None of us thought that go fucking with the 5th dog
Armageddon
Don like a thief
And I can catch you sleeping in the ceiling
Go rock on my court
Stupid motherfucker that heard, that heard
Pull it it's a souvenir, then you'll blow
Niggaz deflect them, put them in glocks
Caught up in knocks
Peeling, stepping him out fucked up

Damon Elliott,"And I never thought I'd feel this way
And as far as I'm concerned
I'm glad I got the chance to say
That I do believe, I love you

And if I should ever go away
Well, then close your eyes and try
To feel the way we do today
And then if you can remember

Keep smiling, keep shining
Knowing you can always count on me, for sure
That's what friends are for
For good times and bad times
I'll be on your side forever more
That's what friends are for

Well, you came in loving me
And now there's so much more I see
And so by the way
I thank you

Oh and then for the times when we're apart
Well, then close your eyes and know
The words are coming from my heart
And then if you can remember

Keep smiling and keep shining
Knowing you can always count on me, for sure
That's what friends are for
In good times and bad times
I'll be on your side forever more
That's what friends are for

Keep smiling, keep shining
Knowing you can always count on me, for sure
That's what friends are for
For good times and bad times
I'll be on your side forever more
That's what friends are for

Keep smiling, keep shining
Knowing you can always count on me, for sure
Cause I tell you, that's what friends are for

Damon Gough,"Why are you trembling so much,
I don't think I ever felt so good.
When all I need is to be free,
Where I love you and you love me.
Follow the circle sur le plage,
On a mono-colored trip voyage.
This is the color of my word,
Stay watch me find another pearl.

Follow the gold leaf trail back where,
We were young and had no care.
Tracing the circles that we made,
I don't want to live a life in shade.
Will this be a desert or a beach,
Or a place to find the things we need.

Now you and I make up perfect things,
Watch me trade my wheels for wings.
But don't ever use those wings to fly
Just the essence of a lullaby
Now I am a giant grain of sand
But I may be slipping through your hand
Follow my color coded world
And watch be find another pearl

It's a sound that I love
And it came from above
These's the sound of the sea
Are you following me

Let's walk to the sound of distant shells
To a place where life would have no end
You'd be the mother of my pearls
If you follow me into my world
Back to a place where I'd be free
Where I'd love you and you'd love me
This is the color of my world
Go watch me find another pearl",Another Pearl,2000

Damon Gough,"Don't back down when your giving be treats
You know that now that I found it
You know that I need it
Don't back me up you say nothing at all
If I was two feet taller
I'd be over the wall
Don't start thinking that I'm too needy
I could give you love for nothing
There's nothing for me
We're like Arabian nights
When the sun goes down
But tell me in the day
You don't want me around

Hold me now cause I'm gonna try
If you don't pour salt water into my eye
We've got a bottle of tears locked up inside
Maybe you'll laugh but the laughs all mine
Hope now baby it's not getting better
As your hopes stay slipping around in the rain
Don't start pulling around at the sheets
When I've got oodles of love growing into me

We've got a bottle of tears locked up inside
Maybe you'll laugh but the laughs all mine
Maybe you'll laugh but the laughs all mine",A Bottle of Tears [*],2000
Damon Gough,"Camping next to water
Fish infested slaughter
I feed the fishes into me
It's a misty within reason
I'm hoping I don't freeze here
I fuel the fire, I feed it's glow
But these's no use in feeling
All the things I'm feeding
There's no one here to feel with me

The second is easier
Though it may be breezier
And the snow is falling down
But as the fire smolders
I will never will grow older
Because I drink from Waterfalls
The stars above shine on me
I'll catch and save them in a jar

My feet a mass of blisters
Collecting frost on whiskers
As I taste the morning Dew
I think my mind is clearer now
I want you to be nearer now
I'm ready t come back to you
Cause there's no use in feeling
All the things I'm feeling
There's no one here to feel with me.",Camping Next to Water,2000
Damon Gough,"Can I get close to ya
If only for a while
I don't mean to busy ya
You're the jive guru, and
I want to sing along with you, with you
Your sweetness could cause a rock slide
If only before the summertime
This could be our last goodbye
Please, darling, please don't cry

Ooh, aah.
Ooh, aah.
Ooh, aah.
Ooh, aah.

Damon Gough,"You fly like an arrow
I lie in the shadow
Only to be blessed with silence
You shoot using your licence to kill the pain

'Cause you fly an arrow
Straight to my heart
Blow it apart every time
You go like a dream
Nothing seems real
Don't even know how I feel

Now your shy
An I'm shallow,
My brain turns like a pulp of marrow,
But oh no, I'm not planning to stay lost
I know I could remove you from chaos

But you touch me with poison
Shoots to my brain
Sending me crazy, insane
Like some kind of marrow
Give you a taste of a feeling
A much brighter place

You fly like an arrow
I lie in the shadows
Only to be blessed with silence
You should use your licence to kill the pain

Damon Gough,"Seems you created your own illusion
Fueled by an image of me
Well I couldn't stay at your side
It wouldn't be right
A picture that I just don't see
Why do you have to make it so complicated
Can't it just be beautiful
I don't want to stifle your flight
I didn't mean to fall in love

Always in pursuit of the perfect people
Oh and I can see that it shows
But there's just an innocence in you I want to wring out
I know it could be beautiful

But I don't want a part of some situation
I don't want to be in that boat
I don't want to stifle your flight

Only need to whisper please don't shout
Plant the seed let seed of love grow
Floating down the stream against the flow

Fate please show me to the edge of town
Don't blast me to the moon I'll still come down
Distant love I don't know where to start
Shadowed by the blister on your heart

All I need is perfect timing
To dodge these tumbleweeds around me
Listen to my senseless rhyming

Your scent is all I need
It makes me sneeze
This is how you find me
Just listen when I sneeze
Your scent is all I need
I'll catch it on the breeze
Just listen when I sneeze
Your scent is all I need

Damon Gough,"Please don't leave me wanting more
I hope you never die
These's no need to say why
Just promise that you'll try
To give me all you can
I'll never ask for more
There's a new life through the door
A cradle rocks and falls
Cements the melody
Our troubles passing

Through decaying, simple times
I'll tread on your tail with pride

Just promise that you'll try",Epitaph,2000
Damon Gough,"Been feeling high
And then feeling low
Strap your hands across my engines
I'm not broke so please don't mend me

You're like a neon sign
Just burning so bright
Penetrates like an infection
You give me feelings I can't mention

[Chorus]
Maybe, all I need
You need too
Don't wait for me
I'll wait for you

I'm gonna follow you around
I'm gonna wear you down
I don't want to alienate you
You've got as long as it might take you

Good things come in ones
And double up to two
Don't want to rain on your procession
Only seeking your obsession

It might take a little time
Got all the time we need
I'm not here to try and fool ya
Just trying to break on through ya

Now that wasn't right
But then nothing's wrong

And it feels so good
I see the lights fading
Lets gather the rain
Inside your hood
Now I hear she's got the fever
Oh and I need her, I knew I would
Now I see your stalling
Catch me I'm falling underground

Now I sense the ground is moving
Yet something is proving me wrong I find
I see the colour changing
To follow the range inside your mind
I've tried to please her, maybe I'll weave her a lullaby
The fallen trees are not yet in season
But underground

A giant grain of sand could
Slip through your hand
And you wouldn't know
You fly away, I'm sailing
My heart would be failing without this glow
I wonder if you've seen me
With infinite greenery all around
If I could here you calling
I'd break down the walls that defend her sound",It Came From the Ground [*],2000

How she made me feel
Today, today, today
Feels right

We slept on leaves, on my drive
All night

I'm putting you out
Maybe tonight we could be the last shout
But I'm fascinated by your style
Your beauty will last for a while

You're feeling instead of being
The more that I live on the outside
There's nothing to give
I'm infatuated by your moves
I've got to search hard for your clues

I want to repair your desire
And call it a gift
That I stole from just wanting to live
How I see the vision through your eyes
Your innocence no longer fuels surprise

Trying to outrun your fear
You're running to lose, heart on your sleeve
And your sole in your shoes

I've tried to hear, you're not near.
Remembering when I saw your face,
Shining my way, pure timing.
Now I've fallen in deep, slow silent sleep,
It's killing me, I'm dying.

To put a little sunshine in your life.

Soleil all over you, warm sun pours over me.
Soleil all over you
Warm sun.

Now this slick fallen rift,
Came like a gift,
Your body moves ever nearer
And your will dry this tear

Now that we're here, and grieve for me, not history
But now I'm dry of thoughts, wait for the rain,
Then it's replaced, sun setting

And suddenly we're in love with everything.

Soleil all over you, warm sun pours over me.
Soleil all over you
Warm sun.",The Shining,2000
Damon Gough,"So we restore harmony
Smooth the lines on the face of an old enemy
But there's no wood on the fire again
We can meet any place
You know where, I know when
To go

Skid like a stone on the water
Fall with no trace to lie permanently
Ooh, ooh, ooh ooh

Into the valley we roll
Where we fumble around 'till we find our way home
Yet, all we have is an old ball of string
Will it reach to the end
Of this dark labyrinth?
No

Skid like a stone on the water
Fall with no trace to lie permanently
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh",Stone on the Water,2000
Damon Gough,"This song will be here when you're old
This song will heat you when you're co-old
Believe you when I don't
This song will heal you from your soul

This song will help you find a place to live
And teach you not to take but give
This song will help you in your dying doubts
This song will send your lover flowers

Blessed by this song and the gifts that it brings
Rest by this song and the peace that it brings
Beautiful song it has wings",This Song,2000

Damon Gray,"Everyone I see these days still asks me about you
I guess they got so used to us together they assume 
That everything's ok and then I have to say

I wouldn't know I haven't seen him
I couldn't say it's been awhile
I haven't thought about him lately
So I wouldn't know
I'm getting tired of people askin' 
Why can't they just leave me alone 
Cause I couldn't care, I couldn't say, I wouldn't know

I don't get out anymore to our old stompin' grounds
Cause some old friend is bound to ask me why you're not around
Well I just stay away, so I don't have to say

I wouldn't know I haven't seen him
I couldn't say it's been awhile
I haven't thought about him lately

Damon Johnson,"This time
Maybe I was the killing kind
I go
But my leaving has gone awry
These days
Am I losing again?
 
The patience bending out of shape
Inside out my poor escape
 
Time turns a key that I'm holding on to
Can we feel the freedom another day
Hail to the truth inside hiding from you
Can't let it fail to deliver us away
I'm turning around and I'm tellin' the truth
 
Look hard
Look at me I'm the only one
To decide
To release what I'm runnin' from
You said
It was worth everything

And now these thoughts of hope embrace
The me I'm turning round to face
 
Don't fade this time
You'll be inspired
I've been resigned
When these fears subside
You'll know me
 
This time, decide, to look hard, inside",The Truth,2000
Damon Johnson,"From his youth he sees inside, 
A slow parade of storms
Lessons learned from fear are nothin' to lose
The voice remains it sounds the same
Even from so far
And he feels much better
From the sky, hear the call
 
Faces and colors they change I fade from believin'
When I'm lost in the shadows to roam
The voice of Eujena can send me home
 
Draw this bridge and sail away
The boy becomes a man
To fight his own battles and realize some dreams
Beacon light shine all around
Guides the ship to shore
And he feels much better
In the light safe he goes
 
Faces and colors they change I fade from believin'
I feel lost in the shadows alone
With no ending
Faces and colors they've changed
Through all that I've known
But the voice of Eujena can send me home
 
In silent time my closest friend
Without her strength I'd fall
Peace of mind and soul are nothin' to lose
Rest insider her voice and find
Everything I need
And I feel much better
May the voice carry on",Voice of Eujena,2000

We'll sigh goodbye to all we ever had
Alone where we have walked together

I'll be content you loved me once in April
Your lips were warm and love and spring were new
I'm not afraid of autumn and her sorrow

I don't wanna

While I take the rest of you apart
I didn't think my luck would last forever
But I think right here is where
We'll start
When the lines of the past have been blurred
It gets much easier to tell those around
To let go

[Chorus]
Now is the time when we find out
What's really happening how was the ride of your life?
Now is the time when we find out
What's really happening how was the ride of your life of your life?

You can put your faith in me forever
While everything around you falls apart
When you lost what you got when they took you to bet
And they beat you down for every penny well then
You can bet that I know who they are
When the lies from the past have left you burned
It gets much easier to tell those you love
To let go

Another couple minutes I'm free
Working past nine, flip over that sign

Everybody's outside
Get used to us disturbing the peace
So take it easy, cuz we're here all night
Tell your momma not to call the police

If you're down, dontcha get me down
So get

Outta my way

And I went back and smiled but did not say a word
If I did something wrong, then I got what I deserved

Well I must not be too smart
If I can't fix what I let fall apart
But standing there listening was like being stabbed in the heart

So when I saw you out again on Saturday night
We stood outside and had what felt like a fight
I walked home hoping everything was all right

Well I must not be too smart
If I can't fix what I watched fall apart

Everyone knows that it's all I can do
Just to hide away all these feelings for you

Damone Tyrell,"Past the rapping the similes all these metaphors punchlines 
Fancy flows rhyming double time 
With a humble mind 
I get my ego and attitude from my homies and various competition that tend brag when I stumble flying 
I'm still a newbie 
I started with on shuffle 
Burning various calories now I'm coming off the muscle 
In 2012 I built a studio inside these walls
Closing the gap and burning bridge I walk across 
They call me selfish cause I always do what's best for me 
Cooking in the studio you know I got the recipe 
But I lose sight of my identity 
I never feel like me 
But that's a dynamic of character you'll never see 
I'm only human I've made plenty mistakes 
Regretful for all my sins doing everything it takes 
to repent 
But still I feel these flows are heaven sent 
Try my hardest just to move curse these shoes they were made in cement 
Im always so hard myself 
Expecting more than I can give or get from someone else
I used to be happy go lucky 
Feeling like no one can touch me 
They rush me 
They claim they love me 
That I've never felt 
I'm tryna go back to them days 
Where I played video games 
And wasn't concerned with general pop knowing my name 
Looking straight in the mirror it's rare that I feel the same 
Im driving myself insane lost my mind just gain 
I keep my feelings locked away inside my notebook 
Back when it was all raps and no hooks 
Back when I would tell a story that would leave your soul shook
Back when all these thirsty women never gave me no looks 
I was always crying and pathetic now I'm wise beyond prophetic 
With delivery so sharp that you forget about the message 
Im thankful for my blessing 
Living and learning lessons 
But Im stuck inside myself asking questions 

Man I don't want to change but I still need to grow 
They ask me who I am but I don't even know 
Man I don't want to change but I still need to grow 
They ask me who I am but I don't even know

Les anges de l'enfer l'escortent
Le hashtag #Vie tient peut-être d'elle
De son cou pendu à la corde
Trop jeune pour comprendre l'impact des mots
J'm'en fous de c'qu'elle veut tant que j'ai ce qu'il me faut
13 ans déjà mon premier rapport
Depuis mon cœur a fermé la porte
Aussi bizarre que cela puisse paraître
Après l'avoir ken' j'voulais qu'elle disparaisse
Elle voulait qu'on s'aime mais je n'voulais pas
J'étais l'dernier à faire le premier pas
Plus les années passent et plus lourde est la tâche
J'la trouvais pas bonne et j'voulais qu'elle le sache
Dans la méchanceté j'me sentais si bien
J'étais loin d'imaginer son quotidien
Des larmes séchées sur ses poèmes
Qu'elle m'écrivait en recherchant plaisir clitoridien
Faux-cul j'étais comme un ""Allez l'OM""
Scandé par un supporter parisien
Le jour de son suicide je n'en revenais pas
La veille elle voulait que j'la prenne dans mes bras
Mais j'suis pas doué dès qu'on s'éloigne des draps
J'suis plus dans le ""suce-moi et concentre-toi""
Dernier message elle parle au répondeur
""Allo Damso j'vais faire sonner mon heure""

C'est en quelque sorte une entente entre deux âmes
L'âme qui est dans le corps décide qu'elle ne peut plus continuer de vivre
Et au lieu de faire mourir son corps une autre âme va continuer de vivre sa vie à sa place
Comme vous avez pu le constater votre âme a été victime d'une tentative d'échange forcé
Mais si le transfert total a échoué c'est à cause d'une seule et unique chose
Le Walk Out devait être capable de reproduire la chose qui vous caractérise le plus dans ce monde

Dis moi la vérité, rien que la vérité
Est-ce que t'aimes vraiment la meuf avec qui t'es?
Ou juste par habitude t'oses plus la quitter?
Tu fumais pour fuir, maintenant fuis pour fumer
Mon inspiration n'aime pas trop l'industrie
Car l'industrie veut toujours plus consommer
J'te vois rapper, rapper jusqu'à faire de la merde
Jusqu'à qu'on écrive pour toi comme J.Hallyday
Mon renoi protège toi de la célébrité
Elles t'aimeront plus si t'sais plus faire c'que tu fais
Elles t'aimeront plus si t'sais même plus faire de blé
Elles t'aimeront plus surtout si tu t'fais doublé
Tu parles de Lambo mais tu prends le métro
T'as fait qu'un album mais c'était l'album de trop
J'marque l'histoire à chaque fin de ceau-mor
Le sorcier est vrai ce n'est pas du Gryffondor
L'amour d'une mère peut faire plus de mal que d'bien
Le sida se transmet aussi par le sein
Un bateau pirate dans un océan noir
Plus le chemin est long plus les routes se séparent
J'ai foncé craché sans regarder où j'allais
Ta beauté me cachait ton hépatite C
J'ai pris des couleurs et je crie de douleur
Et je prie à toute heure même si j'sais où j'irai
J'ai fermé des gueules j'en ai cassé d'autres
Je t'ai dis j'suis ni des leurs j'suis ni des vôtres
Dis pas que j'viens de la rue parce que ça c'est des couilles
Quand tu vendais de la drogue j'allais a l'école
Mais l'école a fini par m'mettre à la rue
Et la rue a fini par m'faire vendre de la drogue
Y a ceux qui font que c'qu'on leur demande
Et ceux qui se demandent si y a des choses à faire
Matraque dans l'anus on se demande
Si bavures policières sont réglementaires
J'suis la craie qui grince sur le tableau
J'suis le mot dans l'dico qui vient de l'argot
Les niquer ma seule obligation
La pression à chaque publication
Toutes les femmes ne sont pas pareilles c'est vrai

J'ai passé ma vie à vivre en rappel

Le temps passe vite mais

Donc on hésite puis on s'fait chier
Donc on médite pour exister

Que tu peux mourir au moindre accident
Crois pas qu'c'est simple, crois pas qu'c'est dur
Crois juste en toi, crois pas les gens
J'viens de la rue, d'la belle étoile
Pour vivre dans l'abus, hôtel cinq étoiles
Des fois, je regrette quand j'y repense
J'fumais mon petch, ma Gordon me manque
Le futur existe que parce qu'on y croit
Si demain s'arrête, j'te connaîtrais mieux
J'parlerai de moi comme si c'était toi
J'parlerai de nous comme si c'étaient eux
Pendant qu'on s'rapproche, pour s'refouler
Ou faire semblant d'à nouveau s'aimer
L'amour s'y vieillit, se fait rebelle
Comme un Standard veut improvisé
Cherche aucun son sur la trompette

Dan & Jan Karney,"Some enchanted evening, you may see a stranger,
You may see a stranger across a crowded room,
And somehow you know, you know even then,
That somehow you'll see here again and again.

Some enchanted evening, someone may be laughing,
You may hear her laughing across a crowded room,
And night after night, as strange as it seems,
The sound of her laughter will sing in your dreams.

Who can explain it, who can tell you why?
Fools give you reasons, wise men never try.

Some enchanted evening, when you find your true love,
When you hear her call you across a crowded room,
Then fly to her side and make her your own,
Or all through your life you may dream all alone.

Once you have found her, never let her go.",Some Enchanted Evening [From South Pacific],

Let me prove that it adores
That loveliness of yours.

Content to stargaze at the skies.
Now I only want to to melt
The stardust in your eyes.

It was 102°
Nothin' to do
Man it was hot
So we jumped in

We were summertime sippin', sippin'
Sweet tea kissin' off of your lips
T-shirt drippin', drippin' wet
How could I forget?

Watchin' that blonde hair swing
To every song I'd sing
You were California beautiful
I was playin' everything but cool
I can still hear that sound
Of every wave crashin' down
Like the tears we cried
That day we had to leave
It was everything we wanted it to be
The summer of
19 you and me

We had our first dance in the sand
It was one hell of a souvenir
Tangled up, so in love
So, let's just stay right here

'Til the sun starts creepin', creepin' up
Right then I knew
Just what you were thinkin', thinkin' of
When I looked at you

Watchin' that blonde hair swing
To every song I'd sing

Let it all go, I'll be a pillow, slide just a little closer, let me warm you up
Darling, drown in a river that you're caught in
I wanna get lost in your silhouette, and don't forget that red, wet kiss on my lips.
We don't have to go outside, baby just close your eyes

Hold your body like a sweet, sweet rose
From your long brown hair to your curled up toes
Pull you in, keep you close
I wanna know the you nobody knows.

We can cover all the windows and hide out in the dark

Finally figured out what a boy been missin'
Sinkin' into those eyes, yeah wrong never felt so right
We were small town, summertime sunset dreamin',
Man there ain't nothin' like a first time feelin'

Wrapped up there in a blanket, nervous kiss, hands were shakin'
Yeah we knew we were getting into, there was magic underneath that moon,
Driving me crazy, more than she could ever know,

There was something missing, something not the same
You were there, but you weren’t, didn’t care, didn’t hurt at all
Said it was what it was, then the feeling of us was gone

I watched you fade away
But I turned my head and closed my eyes
And prayed you’d stay
And I told myself that it’d be fine
I wish I could have just said somethin’, oh
When you said you needed time
I heard goodbye
Goodbye

It was way too easy to say those words you said
And the look on your face, I could tell there was nothin’ left
Almost wished we were fightin’, screamin’, and cryin’, but
Not a drop of a tear, didn’t know how to feel, I was numb

And I get to shakin' when you put your lips on mine

It could be the best night of my life, least 'til next time
Oh yea, gotta get this right, follow all the rules and be back by 9
Pulled up to drop you off, leanin' in to sneak one more
Said ""Baby, when can I see you again? How 'bout every night after this?""

I drive away from your house, chasin' butterflies out
Girl, I don't know how you do it
Roll the radio down, say ""I love you"" out loud
Man, I think I'm 'bout to lose it
Ain't my thing to jump the gun,
But I called my dad and said ""She's the one""
Said ""Boy, better get that ring, if you really wanna change her name""
Like a merry-go-round, got my head spinnin' round and round and round

That's just what you do, do, do, do, do, do, do to me
Yea, that's just what you do, do, do, do, do to me

A plowin through the ragged sky and up the cloudy draw

Yippee-I-Yay
Yippee-I-Yo

Their brands were still on fire and their hoofs were made of steel
Their horns were black and shiney and their hot breath he could feel
A bolt of fear went through him as they thundered through the sky

Yippee-I-Yo
Ghost Riders in the Sky

Their faces gone, their eyes were blurred , their shirts all soaked with sweat
Their rindin hard to catch that heard but they ain't caught em yet
Cause they got to ride forever in that range up in the sky
On horses snortin fire... as they ride they hear their cry

I'm gonna tell you a little bit about this 
So that you'll understand what I'm talkin' about

And in the fields looks somethin' like a turnip green
And everybody calls it polk salad, polk salad

And she'd go out in the evenings and pick her a mess of it
Carry it home and cook it for supper

Back when I was goin' to school, I never learned a thing
All I did was daydream, a-waitin' for the bell to ring
I had a certain teacher, I always tried to impress her
When she stood up in the classroom, I would mentally undress her
Then one day I decided, that I would write a little letter
She said the spellin' was a masterpiece, the punctuation could be better
I understood what she was saying, I got the gist of her sentiment
She said I don't mean to be degrading, but here's the way that it shoulda
    went

[Chorus (2x):]
I love you period
Do you love me question mark
Please, please exclamation point
I want to hold you in parentheses

Right on up to high school, people said I was a writin' fool
All my letters became really great, with punctuation that was never late

And I don't see things the same as I did from down there on your floor

I'm pretty sure that I'm over you 

Take back that photograph with your pretty little red dress on 
I don't need the memories that keep me walking the floor until dawn 
But don't you worry because my lonely night will soon be through 
Because I'm pretty sure that I'm over you 
Oh yes I'm pretty sure that I'm over you 
 
And I just don't feel the same as I did before

She's coming back down 
This carousel ride has stopped spinning round 
She wants to say she's sorry and stay but it's too late

But clocks they do run and change what's been done say goodbye

She wanted things to turn out like she'd seen on that silver screen
So she hit the road with her thumb in the air and a ring in her nose
She had a tattoo of a butterfly because that's the way it goes 
When you don't know just which way the wind will blow

Hey girl where are you going to
Say that you'll be the queen of heartbreak avenue

She met a boy out there with a silver el dorado and jet black hair
He had a tattoo of Elvis so they took their clothes off to compare 
And well you know just how far these things can go

Never feels like it did last night
He left a letter that said goodbye hold on tight

Say you wasn't home till the sun was shining far too bright 
The way you wear your hair I know it surely was not right 
Ms. Williams could you tell me where you stayed last night 

Sun goes down and it's the same old thing 
Float the whiskey river to the mountains of cocaine 
Looking for that one true love to tell her she's a star 
Instead she's drinking with a long haired boy that plays a rock and roll guitar

[Chorus:] 
she just wants to shine 
Her heart gets broken every time but she knows some day soon she'll find 
Ms. Williams where did you stay last night

Points her headlights into hollywood because she wants so much more

But did I mention I got a new mercedes benz 
Smile pretty be witty come meet your brand new friends

I got this guitar I play a little out of tune 
But it makes no difference if I get all the right tattoos 
And hey get a look at these cheekbones

But me I'm gonna be a rock and roll star

Walking up on my street to her swanky little job uptown 
She's got an office with a window I'm looking out my window too 
I wish the four winds would blow and change my point of view 

Doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo 
She wears them high steppin shoes and her dress seems to fit so right 
I got two pair of corduroy pants everybody says they fit too tight 
I got a 3 dollar shirts on she got 55 dollar hair 
I want to pick her up and take her down but she's already been there probably two times 

[Chorus:] 
And every time I see her I just cry 
Ain't no sense in even wondering why 
She don't care about me 

I know she lives on 4th street or somewhere round about all 
I want to do is hold her hand or hang her dirty laundry out 
She's got a sister names Alice her older brother's name is bill 
She ain't got no dentist but her teeth are shiny still 

[Chorus]
 
She probably likes those older men with those big long cars and don't care much for fools like me That spend time in all these smoke filled bars 
She likes shirts and ties and cigarettes that smell like fallen leaves I just want to be the monkey That she lets climb her big tall tree

Dan Baird,"Here we sit again and tales begin to spin
About the things that we've done and seen
Stories of wine glutton and glory
And the occasional altered dreams

Appetites for memories grow
As the sunshine begins to fade
Across the hill it's the same old chill
Lurking right there in the shade

Just a child with bright eyes and a smile
Laughter was all she knew
Her mama was away and all papa did was pray
So the wanderlust slowly grew

She spread her wings and a couple other things
For the medicine man downtown
With his bottle of elixir he said that he would fix her
And soon she was going down

And everyone begins to look the same
Feel the burn from the same old evil flame
We watched her fall from sweet and kind
And I wish she could come back sweet Magdeline

She was gone on a bad trip
Followed by a needle and a silver spoon
Mama sat and cried and papa told us lies
Said she'd be back real soon

Suddenly the seasons changed
From the fall back to the spring
Answers live like peasants here
When the questions reign as king

And everyone begins to look the same
Feel the burn from the same old evil flame
We watched her fall from sweet and kind
And I wish she could come back sweet Magdeline

Just a child with bright eyes and a smile
Laughter was all she knew
Mama was away and papa sat and prayed
While the wanderlust that slowly grew

She spread her wings and wanted to do things
For the medicine man downtown
And with his bottle of elixir he said that he would fix her
And soon she was, soon she was going down, yeah

Dan Baird,"I remember as the seasons turned to fall 
Wind was sitting and the leaves fell a hinting a sign of the near winter's ball 
Chill in the air as I strolled down the front steps looking for a tale to tell 
Then she slipped me a stare as I slid into my chair she already knew me too well 

She said hello in that beautiful voice my reply was nowhere as sweet 
She seemed impressed by the state of my mess laughed at the wings on my feet 
Offered me a cigarette and before I could even refuse 
We were standing alone she was chilled to the bone she told me to sing the blues 

[Chorus:] 
Hey hey now I feel alright and I just wanted to see 
If I may if I might be the king of your world tonight 
So I told her of the books I'd read and details about the time I stole 6 dollars from a man named Jed just to turn around and pay him back 

I quoted my favorite poem but I ended it terribly wrong 
She said I understand then she clapped both her hands and said that's my favorite song 

[Chorus]

Just then a man walked in and took her away she said her sweet goodbye 
I'll see you again some day so it was over and I was standing there all alone 
And I said to myself as I dusted my shelf this time I think it was love

Don't you know I'll be your fool again 
You say now you're gone and you won't be back 
This time around I'm just a little bit smarter than that 
Just because you've packed your bags 
That doesn't mean that you won't return 
That's the lesson I learned the last time I let you back in 
Don't you know I'll be your fool again 

My friends tell me that they doubt it 
When I tell them I can learn to live without it 
They say it's a game that I can't win

You say he brings you flowers and bottles of cheap red wine

And who ever knew 
Who'd ever think that I would be crying to you
 
What can I say, dear, after I say I'm sorry?
What can I do to prove it to you, I'm sorry?
I didn't mean to ever be mean to you
If I didn't care I wouldn't feel like I do
I was all wrong but right or wrong I don't blame you

Can't go on like this,

Darling your eyes are asking, ""Will the flame burn out?""
Well, no one is sure of sun shine, no one is sure of dawn,
But I am sure my love will live on and  on.
I'll be tired of you  when stars are tired of gleaming
When I am tired of dreaming, then I'll be tired of  you.
This I know is true, when winds are tired of blowing,
When grass is tired of growing, then I'll be tired  of you.

With siliconin her breasts
It turned out her grandma and her mother
Both had the implants done well
Evolution took care of it this time around
And I wondered what it is about
So many women with big breasts
Make it look so sad and I thought well
Maybe it has something to do with the weight
The burden there is to carry in the world
To have to feed it
To be the object of its desires and
I wondered what burdens the rest of us
Are carrying all the time

And not do nothing except look everyone I see in the eyes
And not be the first one to avert my eyes
No matter what

And the expectant father of 16 children
By 13 different women

I was in a fishing village in the coast of spain
It was our lady of abortions Sunday afternoon
All the pregnant women in their first trimester
Were filing before the priest
To receive their blessing of
Try again sometime, try again
The old barber had died his hair green for the occasion
And pierced his nipples and
Was riding his skateboard to the statue
Of conan o'brien
Where he was doing backflips for the kids
Who threw coins
Given to them by their parents

The visiting lecturer
Achingly handsome
Just finished giving a
How to build bombs in your basement
Seminar in the park
All the young girls put away their
Notebooks dreamily

Type out hamlet three years before
Was sitting in the third floor office of a
Drivers license building
Typing out zoning ordinances
Typing out learners permits
Bored and lonely

Pee wee herman was sitting in the
Central square on the grass
Naked and masturbating
While all the townspeople moved to him
Slowly and kissed him softly and sung him
Lullabyes in the grass
And in burkley and in greenwhich village
And in paris and scottsbluff nebraska
No one sits around in funky little coffee shops
Anymore talking about revolution
No they get a starbucks to go
And they go back to their basketball games
Where they see who can jump higher
Who can jam
Who can take it to the rafts
And they all wear baseball caps
Except they don't say yankees or dodgers
They say nike, reebok, adidas
Cause the pro players don't play for teams anymore
They play for shoe companies
And the kids aren't fooled
Nah they're just biding their time
Waiting for the millennium to come
When all the computers will crash
Cause all the brilliant scientists of the world
Forgot to make them read

Like I sometimes get
Suddenly everything cleared
And I realized the only purpose
For revolution is to be able to love
Who you want
How you want
When you want and
Where you want
So I took off all my clothes
Stole a boat and road out to the middle of the lake
And jumped in
And I looked back at you
And said come on

Maked up and caked up and lookin' like some kind of china doll
With all of Adolf Hitler's moves down cold
As they stood up in front of a rock and roll band
And always moving upward and ever upward
To this gentle golden promised land
With the smartest of them all moonlighting as a word processor
And the strongest of them all checking ID's outside saloons
And the prettiest of them all taking off her clothes
In front of men whose eyes look like they were in some 
Little hick town near Omaha watching the police chief 
Run his car off the side of a bridge
I saw men with dreams like the ones I'd had
Beg quarters outside the 7-11
Till it got so they didn't affect me anymore
Then the mailboxes I'd passed 'cept that sometimes
I'd put something in the mailbox
I'd had the wind at my back
Now I felt it cold in my face
And for an awful long time now you were the only one who ever 
Called me late at night and I really never noticed till after 
You stopped calling and the emptiness, silence got so heavy

Broken up in the wasteland
Broken up in the promised land
Broken up in Disneyland
Broken up in the plastic land
Broken up in the wasteland, broken up in the wasteland
Broken up in the wasteland

In Hollywood like some two bit whore offering a discount rate
And I wondered how Joe Dimagio (sp??) felt
I saw dead James Dean's ghost wandering the sidewalk
Looking troubled and I wondered how his mama felt
I saw signs that said head shots done for cheap
Signs that said extras wanted top dollars paid
Signs for haircuts signs for manicures and
Signs for tanning salons and signs for wardrobe specialists
Signs for cosmetic surgery and signs for assertiveness training
And I stopped to read them all
And every single block looked like every single block
Looked like every single block looked like every single block
Looked like every single block but you kept driving
Cause everyone else kept driving and cause gridlock
Is evil and not knowing your way is evil
And those that had money looked good but weren't too happy
And those who didn't have money didn't look so good 
And weren't too happy either and in a city of three million
two hundred and sixty nine thousand nine hundred eighty four
Everyone was lonely

Broken up in the wasteland
Broken up in the promised land
Broken up in Disneyland
Broken up in the plastic land
Broken up in the wasteland, broken up in the wasteland
Broken up in the wasteland

And I watched as everyone I knew spent their lives
Trying to be watched on a stage or watched on a film
Or listened to on a record and they thought well maybe
That way I could get a little love out of this life
And I watched as the best of my generation abandoned their dreams
And settled for making a little money
And I watched TV and read the papers and listened to the radio
And made all the fancy scenes and said all the right words
And wore all the right clothes and knew the names of the hip people
But I still felt out of touch so I stopped watching TV
And reading the papers and listening to the radio
And making the fancy scenes and saying the right words
And wearing the right clothes and knowing the names of the hip people
And I felt more out of touch than ever but I didn't care anymore
And I felt you slipping away, and I felt myself slipping from you
And I wanted more than anything else for it to rain for one 
Whole day like it used to but all there ever was was sun
Relentless sun hot beating sun and everyone wore their
Sunglasses and walked around like flies under a magnifying glass
With their eyes removed

Broken up in the wasteland
Broken up in the promised land
Broken up in Disneyland
Broken up in the plastic land
Broken up in the wasteland, broken up in the wasteland
Broken up in the wasteland, broken up in the wasteland 
Broken up in the wasteland

Dan Bern,"She said, ""Love, love, love is everything""
I said, ""Okay, I guess, whatever""
She said, ""What does that mean?""
I said, ""Nothing, it's just good to have a backup plan""

She said, ""I guess that means you don't got love""
I said, ""Maybe I love everyone""
She said, ""That's the same as loving no one""
I said, ""Okay, I guess, whatever""

I have a dream of a new American language
One with a little bit more Spanish
I have a dream of a new pop music
That tells the truth with a good beat and some nice harmonies

I have a dream
I have a dream

Tourist towns are a drag sometimes
But in non-tourist towns, you can get beat up
Just for looking a little different
I guess the thing to do is just stay at home
Yeah, but sometimes I think the thing to do
Would be to get a place way out in Missouri
Put down as many months' rent as you can part with
Tell everybody else you went to France

I said, ""Remember that conversation we had about love?
Well, I think you were right""
She said, ""I don't remember saying nothing about love
It must have been a fantasy of the moment""

I have a dream
I have a dream

I have a dream of Michaelangelo on that ceiling 
Working through weekend to make more money 
I have a dream of replacing Steve Kerr on the Bulls 
And being the little white guy they let shoot the threes 

I dream of joining the Mafia
And whether people like me is unimportant
I dream of your clock radio
Waking you up with my songs

I have a dream of a new American language 
I dream of new beginnings
I dream of saturation bombing
I dream mostly about love

I have a dream
I have a dream
I have a dream

Dan Bern,"I thought you came here to dance
But it seems you had other plans
What's there to talk about?
What's there to figure out?
Sometimes I feel like an experiment

Tell me, where has the sweetness gone?
Where is the loving song?
Where, oh, where in the world?

Can't you just spin while I play?
Must we come up with a hundred and ten reasons why we're alive today?
I won't mind if you probe, babe
Start with my earlobe, babe
And then start whispering to me

Tell me, where has the sweetness gone?
Where is the loving song?
Where, oh, where in the world?

The only reason you used to need
To be around me was me

Tell me, where has the sweetness gone?
Where is the loving song?
Where, oh, where in the world?

Dan Bern,"My clothes and my windshield wipers and a locket of my hair 
Everything is for sale
My rifle and my boots and my instant coffee maker 
That poem 'bout the moon over Switzerland 
My flowers and my walkie-talkie 
All the liquid in my body 
I'll set a price and post it to your e-mail 
But my love, my love is not for sale 

I could sell my pictures on the streets of Barcelona 
Women 30 minutes at a time 
New York City subway, 3 songs for a dollar 
Or maybe just a chorus for a dime 
The newspaper on the street
The sky reflecting at my feet 
It's all been bottled, packaged, drawn to scale 
But my love, my love is not for sale

Take just a minute of your day
Tell me one thing that you would live for 
Dying, dying's easy, getting easier all the time 
Tell me one thing not to throw it all away for
 
I'll sell you the morning and I'll sell you the night 
I'll sell you the river and move along 
I'll sell you the balconies, I'll sell you the sidewalks 
And all the shuttered windows of Bresson 
I'll sell you the moon, I'll sell you the stars
And the forests with the lonesome wolfhound's wail

But my love, my love 
My love is not for sale 

Suicide bomb

This is the last song I will ever write 
I'll plug my ears and cover up my eyes to mask my sight
I'm killing off my instincts after 2,000 songs 
I'm getting with the program, now I'm gonna play along 

This is my songwriting suicide bomb 
This is my songwriting suicide bomb

I can't compete with blowing up yourself on a bus
Killing one of you and 19 of us 
Flying hi-jacked airplanes so thousands will die 
But I can kill too and blacken out the sky 

This is my songwriting suicide bomb
This is my songwriting suicide bomb 

This is the last song I will ever write 
The last blank page my pen will ever blight 
Abandoning the fight, I'm pulling off the gloves
No longer be a soldier for God or truth or love

Dan Bern,"Awful still out here, too still for me 
I'm used to going outside whenever
And something's open, buy some tea 
Feel like you could die here 
Middle of Main Street, plain as day 
And the sun would bake you dry 
And the wind blow you away 

Everybody's shifty 
Some secret's in the air 
Half of me wants to crack the code
The other half don't care 
I wouldn't bat an eyelid 
If right now someone said 
Boy, the folks you're talking to 
Have been a hundred years dead 

Hey, fly away 
Hey, sky is gray 

I don't understand why I owe anybody anything 
I feel like a tightrope walker and they took away my string
Feel like someone squeezed the juice out of my fruit 
Like everyone's in sweatpants and I alone still wear a suit 
I used to feel like a Mexican bandit when I picked up my guitar 
Now it's nuclear winter and I gotta pay for a new car 

Hey, fly away 

Why is the car still running 
Won't someone turn it off 
Who's looking in my window 
I heard somebody cough 
Things so important 
A few months back
Now barely catch my interest 
I feel I'm losing track 
Of people, of names, of places, and of friends 
Excuse me for not keeping up with all the latest trends 

Hey, fly away 

Well excuse me for behaving in a manner that seems rude 
Most of my waking moments deal with finding food 
Something for my family
Something for my nation
Designer boots for grandma
Designer drugs for my patients 
I have been rejected 
I have been collected
I have been injected and inspected and infected 
Don't be dejected
You will be protected 
Send me all your money so that I can get elected

Hey, fly away 

Well I lost my sense of balance and I lost my sense of smell 
In a car accident near the Liberty Bell
I lost my sense of timing and I lost my sense of touch 
From commercials and checking my e-mail too much 
I have no taste lots of people tell me that
My eyesight was pretty much shot right off the bat 
All that's left is some skewed inner vision 
And some obsolete info on nuclear fission 

Hey, fly away  

Well I got this town to myself finally 
Think I'll go and park myself underneath a tree 
And sleep off this headache and sleep off this war 
Maybe my dreams will tell me what it all was for 
I might steal some clothes and get my face all dirty
And hop on the freight train that rolls in around 4:30 
Maybe I'll see you up in the sky 
If we flap our wings and learn to fly 

Hey, fly away",Fly Away,2003
Dan Bern,"Walking around the happiest place in the world
But all I do is wonder if your hair's still curled 
South of Brownsville, Texas south of Miami Beach 
But all it means to me is that you're further out of reach
Everywhere is sand and sun blue sky, water too 
I need you 

The Spanish moss is hanging and you find a polished stone 
You pocket it for luck and then you walk on alone 
They'll rent you a bicycle with the tires blown 
They'll cook you up a blackened fish and strip it to the bone 
A slave ship just came in 
I been talking to the crew 
I need you 

In that house Hemingway is boxing in the back 
I go down to the library and check out all the facts 
Nowadays it's hard to write a line my own thoughts bore me 
I found me an island kid who says he'll do it for me 
I'm wiping all my tears away so no one has a clue 
That I need you 

The last plane out of Saigon did not know that it was
Every man in prison thinks he's locked up for a cause
I need something to do my violin needs to sound 
I'm gonna see if Ernest wants to go a couple rounds
Sometimes you get lost and you find something new
I need you

Some bird's flapping in the road on some crazy madman's string 
Something's messed up with his wing something's messed up with my Everything

So here's the truth at last I tell you 
Hemingway is dead 
And everybody wants to find a steak that's slightly red
I thought I could escape myself by just not getting dressed 
I thought I could escape you by coming to Key West 
Sometimes you get lost and you don't find something new

Dan Bern,"The screen door slams, Mary's dress waves
Like a vision she dances across the porch as the radio plays
Roy Orbison singing for the lonely
Hey, that's me and I want you only
Don't turn me home again, I just can't face myself alone again
Don't run back inside, darling, you know just what I'm here for
So you're scared and you're thinking that maybe we ain't that young anymore
Show a little faith, there's magic in the night
You ain't a beauty but, hey, you're alright
Oh, and that's alright with me

You can hide 'neath your covers and study your pain
Make crosses from your lovers, throw roses in the rain
Waste your summer praying in vain
For a savior to rise from these streets
Well now, I ain't no hero, that's understood
All the redemption I can offer, girl, is beneath this dirty hood
With a chance to make it good somehow
Hey, what else can we do now?
Except roll down the window and let the wind blow back your hair
Well, the night's busting open, these two lanes will take us anywhere
We got one last chance to make it real
To trade in these wings on some wheels
Climb in back, heaven's waiting on down the tracks

Oh oh, come take my hand
We're riding out tonight to case the promised land
Oh oh oh oh, Thunder Road
Oh, Thunder Road, oh, Thunder Road
Lying out there like a killer in the sun
Hey, I know it's late, we can make it if we run
Oh oh oh oh, Thunder Road
Sit tight, take hold, Thunder Road

Well, I got this guitar and I learned how to make it talk
And my car's out back if you're ready to take that long walk
From your front porch to my front seat
The door's open but the ride ain't free
And I know you're lonely for words that I ain't spoken
But tonight we'll be free, all the promises'll be broken

There were ghosts in the eyes of all the boys you sent away
They haunt this dusty beach road in the skeleton frames of burned-out Chevrolets
They scream your name at night in the street
Your graduation gown lies in rags at their feet
And in the lonely cool before dawn
You hear their engines rolling on
But when you get to the porch, they're gone on the wind
So Mary, climb in
It's a town full of losers, I'm pulling out of here to win",Thunder Road,2003
Dan Bern,"I can feel the magic floating in the air
Being with you get's me that way
I watch the sunlight dance across your face
And I've never been this swept away

All my thoughts just seem to settle on the breeze
When I'm lying wrapped up in your arms
The whole world just fades away
The only thing I hear
Is the beating of your heart

'Cause I can feel you breathe
It's washing over me
And suddenly I'm melting into you
There's nothing left to prove
Baby, all we need is just to be
Caught up in the touch
Slow and steady rush
Baby, isn't that the way that love's suppose to be
I can feel you breathe, just breathe

In a way I know my heart is waking up
As all the walls come tumbling down
Closer than I've ever felt before
And I know, and you know
There's no need for words right now

I can feel you breathe
Washing over me
And suddenly I'm melting into you
There's nothing left to prove

I have worked and will keep working... to keep the tradition of my one true motive in life... music... my only love... once building drum boxes and pretending to be the artist...

Dan Briggs,"From the simple idea of Change Blindness, our minds are not as they seem.
An entire existence revolving around what we can't acknowledge.
A brain function we'll never admit as defeat,
A constant determination to find truths
To find reason, to find comfort.
An unspoken religion in being the all-dominant
This is what we call a brain.

This step will allow the universe to run it's course.
We have a short ticket and a lot of it is in hiding
So lets take in what we can for now.
Just like here on Earth(a notion we do comprehend)
Hide what ""others"" can't understand. 
The universe is the biggest threat
Overachiever that commands attention. 
Brute force of hysterical reasoning's
There will always be a Marfa.

Close one eye. 
Step to the side.

As humans we could never be content with knowing all, 
Yet we can't be content with the fact that our brains will never know.
A mental surgery
A never ending journey, a technological drawback.
Pushing us further from our natural minds.
Even things created by other humans should be 
Considered in the experiment of an entire species understanding.

A mind bend for the common folk
Follow the straight line

An unspeakable affair...

The lady on the hill creates a glorious departure from her everyday life.
Constant swelling of the ankles...A pleasant cry for help...
She began to unfold her story.
A grieving widow mothered this headless wonder.

A perfect crime, that soon lived on. A different life it had to develop...
Gripped by every limb it could hold, the lifeless ideas it grew onto its own.
A much needed surrender.
Trees soon started to grow from what seemed like a lifeless neck...

From a monster to a beauty in quick months...
Its life seemed to be on its way to a rare freedom.
It decided it should take advantage of this idea.
(the average traveler hints at this every single day of their lives)

A mixture of plantings soon took course in its body...
A spectacle non-the-less,
Walking proud through life letting its branches guide the way.
A path which seemed to be covered in sunshine...

It must be human, for its qualities seem
To outdo even the grandest occupant of the town...
This started to catch the attention of the un-branched...
It had never experienced an affection of this kind...

A wonderful and frightening new obstacle in its life.
Years went by as it finally found true love...
The love of others...three to be exact.
Letting them into every secret...feeding from every branch...
Every part used for their lives...
(This went on with no negative scents 'til the 5th year came around...)

It noticed its walking seemed more staggered than normal.
The breeze didn't flow like it used to...
The heart seemed to pound slower and slower...
What caused this?
It seen was noticed that these three had torn every branch, every single stem...
Torn to its last life...
How hadn't it noticed a drastic change in the surroundings...
It didn't think anything could go this wrong.

""Comfort...""

It thought life was constant
Happiness if constant happiness was all that was given out.
(It left its entire existence up to these three lovers)

who would want a group of people that one can relate with.
We need worship, we need devotion...
becoming gods from the image that is thrown...

thrown out in their everyday lives to comfort...
it's not a musical journey anymore...
they chose Camilla and we stood by her the entire time...
monotonous expression...a forced replica of a tired sound...

puppets for a greed-driven carnival...
the same charade as the passing years...
force me out there. Don't give them a chance.
They want to be fed...fed a simple replication of past greatness.

Personal happiness is what we strive to achieve...

Has to flourish in the light

To be all that I can

Lead you back to me when you're 
Ready to land

It's been so long now and it seems
Now it was only yesterday
Ain't it funny how time slips away

How's your new love
I hope that he's doin' fine
I heard you told him that
You'd love him till the end of time

Now that's the same thing that you told me
Seems like just the other day
Ain't it funny how time slips away

I gotta go now
I guess I'll see you around
Don't know when though
Never know when I'll be back in town

But remember what I tell
In time you're gonna pay
It's surprising how time slips away

Ain't it funny how time slips away

",Funny How Time Slips Away,1998
Dan Castellaneta,"I just can't help myself, I just can't help myself
I just can't help myself, I just can't help myself
I just can't help myself

There I go, here I go, where I go, I don't know
I just can't help myself, so
Why do I do, what I do, when I do
Well, I can say so or I just don't know

Boys will be boys and what they usually say
That's the how and the why, that I act this way
That's the end of the line, I run out of rhyme
That ain't no crime so it's milk it out time

Let's see, I know it's some cosmic force
Causing my mind, you go,
Just wait out of course to another dimension
Not only of site and sound but of being a clown

Or an alley cat, or a dirty rat or a loud mouth brat
Well, I am all that, so if you ask me, why
I'm always in such a mess
Well, ha, I just can't help myself

Can't help me, I just can't help myself
Can't help me, I just can't help myself
Can't help me, I just can't help myself
Can't help me, I just can't help myself
I just can't help myself, I just can't help myself

A very great lady, once said it right
A woman needs a man, like a fish needs a bike
There I go again sister know it all
No friends at all, 'cause I make them crawl

I can help showing off, all that I know
The whats can do, well is the wheres I could go
I know, it's makes the family very uptight
I know, it isn't right, but I do it every night

I'm probably don't belong here, I'm certainly were wrong here
Every night I have a dream, more like a nightmare
I see myself being born, Mum and dad are there
But it's not Marge and it's not Homer

Switched in a cradle, no wonder I'm a goner
I feel like a book, that's on the wrong shelve
I know, I shouldn't think it, but
I just can't help myself

Can't help me, I just can't help myself
Can't help me, I just can't help myself
Can't help me, I just can't help myself
Can't help me, I just can't help myself

Just can't help myself, I just can't help myself
I just can't help myself, I just can't help myself
I just can't help myself, I just can't help myself
I just can't help myself, I just can't help myself

Hey, you know, I kinda like this thing
It's sort of like music, but you don't have to sing
You got none of the work and all of the fun
Like a low cal donut or a fat free bun

By the way, that's reminds me, how about a snack
Just a small sandwich or a cold six-pack
A big pack of pork rinds that couldn't hurt
A cake for dessert will keep my mind alert

Oh, it takes a lot of energy to do this rap
I feel kinda sleepy, better take a nap
Not too long a nap, two hours, that's a winner
I wouldn't wanna sleep to a roast beef dinner

Roast beef with gravy and potatoes
Hot rolls and butter, lettuce and tomatoes
I know, I shouldn't eat it, I got to keep my health
What's the hey, I can't help me

Can't help me, I just can't help myself
Can't help me, I just can't help myself
Can't help me, I just can't help myself
Can't help me, I just can't help myself

Just can't help myself, I just can't help myself
I just can't help myself, I just can't help myself
I just can't help myself, I just can't help myself

Dan Castellaneta,"Her name was Lola, she was a showgirl 
With yellow feathers in her hair and a dress cut down to there 
She would merengue and do the cha-cha 
And while she tried to be a star 
Tony always tended bar 
Across the crowded floor, they worked from 8 til 4 
They were young and they had each other 
Who could ask for more? 

At the copa (CO!) Copacabana (Copacabana) 
The hottest spot north of Havana (here) 
At the copa (CO!) Copacabana 
Music and passion were always in fashion 
At the copa they fell in love 

His name was Rico 
He wore a diamond 
He was escorted to his chair, he saw Lola dancing there 
And when she finished,he called her over 
But Rico went a bit to far 
Tony sailed across the bar 
And then the punches flew and chairs were smashed in two 
There was blood and a single gun shot 
But just who shot who? 

At the copa she lost her love 

Her name is Lola, she was a showgirl, 
But that was 30 years ago, when they used to have a show 
Now it's a disco, but not for Lola, 
Still in dress she used to wear, 
Faded feathers in her hair 
She sits there so refined,and drinks herself half-blind 
She lost her youth and she lost her Tony 
Now she's lost her mind

And the moon was yellow
And the leaves came tumbling down

I was standing on the corner
When I heard my bulldog bark
He was barkin' at the two men who were gamblin'
In the dark

It was Stagger Lee and Billy
Two men who gambled late
Stagger Lee threw seven
Billy swore that he threw eight
Stagger Lee told Billy
I can't let you go with that
You have won all my money and my brand new
Stetson hat

Stagger Lee went home
And he got his forty-four
Said, I'm goin' to the barroom just to pay that
Debt I owe

Stagger Lee went to the barroom
And he stood across the barroom door
He said, nobody move and he pulled his
Forty-four

Stagger Lee, cried Billy
Oh, please don't take my life
I've got three little children and a very
Sickly wife

But those demons just keep draggin' you back

So be good for goodness sake
Oh! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
 
With little tin horns and little toy drums
Rooty toot toots and rummy tum tums
Santa Claus is comin' to town
And curly head dolls that toddle and coo
Elephants, boats, and kiddie cars too
Santa Claus is comin' to town
Then kids in Girl and Boy land will have a jubilee
They're gonna build a Toyland all around the Christmas tree
So! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
 
Now Santa is a busy man, He has no time to play
He's got millions of stockings to fill on Christmas day
You'd better write your letter now
And mail it right away
Because he's getting ready
His reindeer's and his sleigh. So

Dan Crump,"Ah Oh Ah Oh

Ran into an old friend yesterday
Caught me by surprise when he called my name
He was a familiar face, from a chapter in my past
Talked for a while, I smiled and then
Said that he was seeing somebody and
Told me this was gonna last
Showing me her photograph

And all the feelings that I thought were gone 
Came rushing back to me at once
Tried to smile and hide the way I felt
But I was thinking to myself

(Truth is) I never got over you
(Truth is) Wish I was standing in her shoes
(Truth is) And when it's all said and done
Guess I'm still in love with you
(Truth is) I never should have let you go
(Truth is) And it's killing me cuz now I know
(Truth is) And when it's all said and done
Guess I'm still in love with you

We reminisce on the way things used to be
Shed a couple laughs, shed some memories
Talked about the things that changed
Some for good and some for bad
Then he said good-bye and he paid for lunch
Promised that we'd always keep in touch
Grabbed my bags and grabbed my thoughts, walked away and that was that

And all the feelings that I thought were gone 
Came rushing back to me at once
Tried to smile and hide the way I felt
But I was thinking to myself

(Truth is) I never got over you

(Truth is) And it's killing me cuz now I know
(Truth is) And when it's all said and done
Guess I'm still in love with you

Now the truth is it hurts but I know that the fault is mine
'Cuz I let him go
Tried to get over it but it's messin' with my mind (Because I know)

Here 
I want you closer
Don't ever let go
I need you to know that I'm here
Don't worry
No sir, you won't see me run
'Cause I'm far from done
I'm gonna give you all the lovin' your heart needs

And I'll be your light
I'm shining in the darkest night
I'll take you to a higher place burnin' so bright
I'll be the song that moves you when all hope is gone
I'll give you strength to carry on

If the clouds come to cover your sky
Just know that I will stand by
I'll be there
Yes through the hardest of times
Just seek and you will find
That when the world turns cold and almost gray
I can be the one to hold you and show you the way

And I'll be your light
I'm shining in the darkest night
I'll take you to a higher place burnin' so bright
I'll be the song that moves you when all hope is gone

As the music dies, something in your eyes

Dan Deacon,"When I was done dying, my conscience regained
So I began my struggle, a nothingness strained
Out a flash made of time, my new form blasted out
And it startled me so and I burst out a shout
At which my legs ran frantic like birds from a nest
And I ran until drained, leaving no choice but rest
So I fell asleep softly at the edge of a cave
But I should have gone in deeper but I'm not so brave
And like that I was torn out and thrown in the sky
And I said all my prayers because surely I'll die
As I crashed down and smashed into earth, into dirt
How my skin did explode, leaving only my shirt
But from shirt grew a tree and then tree grew a fruit
And I became the seed and that seed was a brute
And I clawed through the ground with my roots and my leaves
And I tore up the shirt and I ate up the sleeves
And they laughed out at me and said ""what is your plan?""
But their question was foreign, I could not understand
When then suddenly I'm ripped up and placed into a mouth
And it swallowed me down at which time I head south

I said hey ya ya hey ya ya hey ya ya hey ya ya hey ya ya

Well I woke up to see them, these two mighty steeds
With their mouths grinning wildly expressing my needs
As they stood there above me, being flanked on each side
I felt no need to fear them, no reason to hide
So I reached up to touch but they faded too soon
Yet their mouths still remained and stacked up towards the moon
How that ladder of mouth waved so soft in the night
And I looked up in awe at that beautiful sight
And I dreamt about climbing into the night sky
But I knew had I touched them they'd mouth back ""Bye-bye""
So I got up and walked down the path in the dark
And there deep in the distance my eye caught a spark
Of a crab twice my size with incredible strength
Oh, it greeted me kindly and then we all drank
And we drooled out together right onto the ground
And the ocean grew up quickly right up all around
And the earth looked at me and said ""Wasn't that fun?""
And I replied ""I'm sorry if I hurt anyone""
And without even thinking cast me into space
But before she did that she wiped off my own face
She said better luck next time don't worry so much
Without ears I couldn't hear I could just feel the touch
As I feel asleep softly at the edge of a cave
But I should have gone deeper but I'm not so brave

I'm amazed at the price I choose to pay
And to think I ignored what really mattered
Cause I thought the sacrifice would be too great
But when I finally reached the point of giving in
I found the cross was calling even then
And even though it took dying to survive
I've never felt so much alive

For I am crucified with Christ and yet I live
Not I but Christ that lives within me
His Cross will never ask for more than I can give
For its not my strength but His
There's no greater sacrifice
For I am crucified with Christ and yet I live

As I hear the Savior call for daily dying
I will bow beneath the weight of Calvary
Let my hands surrender to His piercing purpose
That holds be to the cross but sets me free
I will glory in the power of the cross
The things I thought were gain I count as loss
And with His suffering I identify
And by His resurrection power I am alive

For I am crucified with Christ and yet I live
Not I but Christ that lives within me
His Cross will never ask for more than I can give
For its not my strength but His
There's no greater sacrifice
For I am crucified with Christ and yet I live

And I will offer all I have
So that His cross is not in vain
For I found to live is Christ
And to die is truly gain

For I am crucified with Christ and yet I live
Not I but Christ that lives within me
His Cross will never ask for more than I can give
For its not my strength but His
There's no greater sacrifice
For I am crucified with Christ and yet I live

At oceans of Your hopes for me, just beyond my reach
I've been here on this island for way too many years
A prisoner of my comfort, a slave to my own fear
Doubt is saying got to stay, faith is saying sail away

I know it's safe here on the shore
But freedom is worth dying for
Liberation comes to those
Who hear the truth and sail with You

I'll go where You are calling me
I'll be what You meant me to be
I know the risk is real, but I wanna feel
The freedom of the sea

With eyes to the horizon, mist against my face
I'll leave behind this island in Your abounding grace
With Your word as my compass I'll chase my destiny
For I know the words of Your will can set my spirit free
Doubt is saying got to stay, faith is saying sail away

I know it's safe here on the shore
But freedom is worth dying for

Dan Dean,"Once there was a holy place
Evidence of God's embrace
And I can almost see mercy's face
Pressed against the veil

Looking down with longing eyes
Mercy must have realized
That once His blood was sacrificed
Freedom would prevail

And as the sky grew dark
And the earth began to shake
With justice no longer in the way

Mercy came running
Like a prisoner set free
Past all my failures to the point of my need
When the sin that I carried
Was all I could see
And when I could not reach mercy
Mercy came running to me

Once there was a broken heart
Way to human from the start
And all the years left it torn apart
Hopeless and afraid

Walls I never meant to build
Left this prisoner unfulfilled
Freedom called but even still
It seemed so far away

I was bound by the chains
From the wages of my sin
Just when I felt like giving in

Mercy came running
Like a prisoner set free
Past all my failures to the point of my need
When the sin that I carried
Was all I could see
And when I could not reach mercy
Mercy came running to me

Sometimes I still feel so far
So far from where I really should be
He gently calls to my heart
Just to remind me

Mercy came running
Like a prisoner set free
Past all my failures to the point of my need
When the sin that I carried
Was all I could see
And when I could not reach mercy
Mercy came running to me

Held my head to His chest,
Said ""My son's come home again!""
Lifted my face,
Wiped the tears from my eyes,
With forgiveness in His voice He said
""Son, do you know I still love You?""

The day I left home,
I knew I'd broken His heart.
And I wondered then, if things could ever be the same.
Then one night,
I remembered His love for me.
And down that dusty road, ahead I could see,
It was the only time,
It was the only time I ever saw Him run.
And then

He ran to me,
He took me in His arms,
Held my head to His chest,
Said ""My son's come home again!""
Lifted my face,
Wiped the tears from my eyes,
With forgiveness in His voice He said
""Son, do you know I still love You?""

He caught me by surprise.
And He brought me to my knees.
When God ran, I saw Him run to me.

I was so ashamed, all alone, and so far away.
But now I know, that He's been waiting for this day
I saw Him run to me,
He took me in His arms,
Held my head to his chest,
Said ""My son's come home again!""
Lifted my face,
Wiped the tears from my eyes,
With forgiveness in His voice
I felt his love for me again.
He ran to me,
He took me in His arms,
Held my head to his chest,
Said ""My son's come home again!""
Lifted my face,
Wiped the tears from my eyes,
With forgiveness in His voice
He said ""Son""
He called me Son.
He said ""Son, do you know I still love You?""

And I'm thinking I wouldn't mind at all.
Love is tearful or it's gay.
It's a problem or it's play,
It's a heartache either way,
But beautiful!

And I'm thinking if you were mine
I'd never let you go,
And that would be but beautiful I know.",But Beautiful,1997

For still having thoughts about you and I
Call me crazy
But it?s hard to let go when we never really said goodbye

Did you shake me
Are you just killing time with him
Did you erase me
Or do you still wonder what might have been
Cause I still wonder
I still wonder

What a story line we made
But we put a bookmark in the page
And we said we?d pick it up another day
With chapters still left to be told
You?ve found someone new to hold
How are you not curious to know how the rest of our story goes

Do you remember
Endless nights at the jersey shore
Do you ever
Wish for just one more afternoon in bed til four
Do you still wonder
Cause I still wonder

And we said we?d pick it up another day
With chapters still left to be told

How are you not curious to know how the rest of our story goes

Why can?t we just pick things up where we left off
Like we said we would
Would we have let each other go
If we new back then it would be for good

If you really cared for me
You would have finally come around
Guess that?s not meant to be
I got a long list of things I need to do before I die
And I can?t wait for you
I would have heard from you by now
If you were gonna be a part of my life

You were there the day I learned to crawl
And I was there to watch you go
Tell me how someone so close to me
Turns into someone I don?t know
And all you left me was my last memory

You would have finally come around
Guess that?s not meant to be
I got a long list of things I need to do before I die
And I can?t wait for you
I would have heard from you by now

I could have used the extra hands to come and pick me up
It would be much easier to stand if you?d just lift me up
I know its not because you can?t
You just don?t care enough
To tell me why should I

Would buy your confessions

made me

Anthems to glory and
Anthems to love and
Hymns filled with early delight
Like the songs that the darkness
Composes to worship the light.

Rolling past a town

That I could not run
I was raised by a river
Weaned upon the sky
And in the mirror of the waters
I saw myself learn to cry
As my tears hit the surface
I saw what had been done
I gave feet to my freedom
And I did run
Someday later
I saw the writing in the dust
It told me how I should travel
It told me who I was
I ran far from the river
Far as I could see
And as the sun hit my shoulders
I felt it burning me
How I longed for the waters
As the fire raged
How I longed for the river
As I aged
I will die by a river
As it rolls away

Dan Fogelberg,"An only child
Alone and wild
A cabinet maker's son
His hands were meant
For different work
And his heart was known
To none --
He left his home
And went his lone
And solitary way
And he gave to me
A gift I know I never
Can repay

A quiet man of music
Denied a simpler fate
He tried to be a soldier once
But his music wouldn't wait
He earned his love
Through discipline
A thundering, velvet hand
His gentle means of sculpting souls
Took me years to understand.

The leader of the band is tired
And his eyes are growing old
But his blood runs through
My instrument
And his song is in my soul --
My life has been a poor attempt
To imitate the man
I'm just a living legacy
To the leader of the band.

My brothers' lives were
Different
For they heard another call
One went to Chicago
And the other to St. Paul
And I'm in Colorado
When I'm not in some hotel
Living out this life I've chose
And come to know so well.

I thank you for the music
And your stories of the road
I thank you for the freedom
When it came my time to go --
I thank you for the kindness
And the times when you got tough
And, pap, I don't think I
Said 'I love you' near enough --

In hopes our hearts can hide us, in hopes our tears don't show
And you know we're not the first to try and breach the distance

Are fading fast

The snow was falling Christmas Eve
I stood behind her in the frozen foods
And I touched her on the sleeve

She didn't recognize the face at first
But then her eyes flew open wide
She went to hug me and she spilled her purse
And we laughed until we cried

We took her groceries to the check out stand
The food was totaled up and bagged
We stood there lost in our embarrassment
As the conversation lagged

We went to have ourselves a drink or two
But couldn't find an open bar
We bought a six-pack at the liquor store
And we drank it in her car

We drank a toast to innocence
We drank a toast to now
We tried to reach beyond the emptiness
But neither one knew how

She said she's married her an architect
Who kept her warm and safe and dry
She would have liked to say she loved the man
But she didn't like to lie

I said the years had been a friend to her
And that her eyes were still as blue
But in those eyes I wasn't sure if I saw
Doubt or gratitude

She said she saw me in the record stores
And that I must be doing well
I said the audience was heavenly
But the traveling was Hell

We drank a toast to innocence
We drank a toast to now
We tried to reach beyond the emptiness
But neither one knew how

We drank a toast to innocence
We drank a toast to time
Reliving, in our eloquence
Another ""Auld Lang Syne""

The beer was empty and our tongues were tired
And running out of things to say
She gave a kiss to me as I got out
And I watched her drive away

And felt that old familiar pain
And, as I turned to make my way back home

Like a virgin locked in
His garage
He brings it out at midnight
And cruises down the
Empty boulevards
And he prowls the
Darkened alleys
That snake between the city`s
Thirsty yards
The lonely desert skies reflect
The anger in his eyes
And it is dawn.

His father died of drinking
And left five children sinking
With his mom
His older brother Bobby

With high school well behind him
He lives at home and works this

Serving shots of whiskey
And tequila
In some smoky red-neck bar
And she dreams some day
She`ll make her way to L.A.
And become a movie star.

He swallowed hard and asked
Her for a date

That she could have if she`d
Just ride along
She said ""What the hell,

So damn long""

Not come home

Them what she saw.

Lying in some narrow,
Dusty draw
And the coroner reported
That she hadn`t been
Deceased for very long.

Buried to the windshield

With a small revolver in

Go so bad?

And it's hard to lose a lover
In the early part of autumn.

Well, she learned to cook the meals
And she learned to start the fire;
And she learned to make jewelry
Out of stones and precious metals.
She sits down to the table
With her friends and several others
And she tries real hard to never be alone.

(Chorus)
Now the winter wind blows cold
Upon a fair and gentle soul
And she feels as if her time is passin' easy.
Her friends are sometimes lovers,
Though they'll always be another
She thinks about when the night time lays on down.

Dan Fogelberg,"There's a place in the Rockies
A place that I know
Where the world cannot find me
And the time goes so slow.
In the piney wood forest
There's a flower that grows
Through the long months of winter
And the high country snows.

To a house by a meadow
'Neath the towering peaks
Is a place where my heart goes
When it's love that it seeks.
There a woman lies waiting
Like the wild growing rose
Through the long months of winter
And the high country snows.

In the space of a lifetime
A man misses much
Till he finds him a woman
And treasures her touch.
When the lakes all are frozen
And the wild wind blows

And the high country snows.

Found a piece of shining gold.

Where the word, like wildfire, spread.

Left that stone in the river bed.

Every woman, child and man
In their lumbering Conestogas
They left their tracks upon the land.

Some would die and some would kill
Some would thank the Lord for their deliverance
And some would curse John Sutter's Mill.

Well, they came from New York City,
And they came from Alabam'
With their dreams of finding fortunes
In this wild unsettled land.

Well, some fell prey to hostile arrows
As they tried to cross the plains.
And some were lost in the Rocky Mountains
With their hands froze to the reins.

Oh...

[Chorus]

Well, some pushed on to California
And others stopped to take their rest.
And by the Spring of Eighteen-sixty
They had opened up the west.

And then the railroad came behind them
And the land was plowed and tamed,
When Old John Sutter went to meet his maker,
He'd not one penny to his name.

You're sorry
Or give it one more try
Or did you only need to see
There was nothing left for me
Inside worth saving.

You smiled back through the doorway
Like you used to
When our hearts still beat as one
And as I turned away
I knew the lonely days had just begun.

And tilled the frozen soil

Little does she know that when she left that day
Along with her she took my heart

Rain won't you tell her that I love her so
Please ask the sun to set her heart aglow
And rain in her heart and let the love we knew start to grow

Listen to the rhythm of the falling rain
Telling me just what a fool I've been
Oh I wish that it would go and let me cry in vain
And let me be alone again

When the rain comes
They run and hide their heads
They might as well be dead
When the rain comes",Rhythm of the Rain,1990
Dan Fogelberg,"Broken clouds along the blue horizon
The sun is setting and the wind is dying down
Outward bound, there is music all around
Can you hear it, it's the song of the sea

Soundings taken at the edge of darkness
The widest silences the heart can ever hear
You can steer to the stars along your lee
Set you bearings to the, the song of the sea
Oh and the song is as ancient as the days

And the winds upon the waves
Let it carry you away, so far away
Trim my sails to greet the breaking morning
Past the headlands to the rolling open sea
And it comes to me, I have never felt so free
As when I'm listening to the, the song of the sea
Oh and the song is as ancient as the days

And the winds upon the waves
Let it carry me away, so far away
Some were meant to watch the world from windows
And never look beyond the road beneath their feet
But for me, I was always meant to be
One forever chasing the song of the sea

In lazy circles in the western skies
I want to fly with him
I want to walk the spirit trail

I've seen them go
Off to the oilfields and rodeos
To find a better way
They leave their native soil

The drum within my heart is beating strong
I want to follow it

With a heart full of light
And a head full of songs
I was thinking of time
And how much it will cost
To recapture the souls
That we surely have lost

In the cities and towns
There are millions who dream
But the traffic's so loud
That you can't hear them scream
There's a heaven on earth
That so few ever find
Though the map's in your soul
And the road's in your mind

So many mountains before us
So many rivers to cross
Where is the wisdom to bring
Back the vision we've lost

Can we gaze with wonder of children
Into the deafening night 
Has it gotten so dark
That we cannot remember the light?

When you sleep on the ground
With the stars in your face
You can feel the full length
Of the beauty and grace

Is an unwelcome guest

And it's here I feel blessed

I saw her first in a beggar's game
Her eyes were wild but her laugh was tame.
Those people knew her by another name.
I knew that she'd be mine,
I knew that she'd be mine.

She took me in on a winter's night
The air was brittle and the moon was bright.
My heart was heavy but her touch was light.
Deep in the dance we wandered,
Deep in my heart she fell.

The candles glistened and the water gleamed.
She drew a bath and the windows steamed;
She looked like every woman ever dreamed,
In the heart of a lonely man,
In the heart of a lonely man.

She took my blindness and she led me through,
As night retreated and the daylight grew.
And with the first rays of the sun I knew,
Love had another captive,
Love had another fool.

[Chorus]

The spell is broken and the chains fall free.
Finally my heart has come home to me.
It seems I've waited an eternity.

Before you falter

What's there but never shows

It's just another day to lay
Your sins before the altar
And where it's going to end
This time around nobody knows

Every time it seems 
That you have gained an understanding
Those devils at your heels
Reach up and try to tip the scales

Waking from a dream
You see it's all been
Done without you
And every vain attempt to make it stay
Is destined to fail

Shades of time that's gone before
Empty cages where the prisoner plays
'Til the door swings closed behind for evermore

We yearn to leave the garden
And wrestle with a myth
The hand of fate has faintly drawn

We feel our hearts begin to harden
And see just as we learn to turn around
The garden is gone

There cuts a path of searing light
Burning like a beacon
On the edges of our sight
At the point of total darkness

A soul can let its shadow stretch
And land on either side --
Either side

And balanced on the precipice
The moment must reveal
Naked in the face of time
Our race within the wheel
As we hang beneath the heavens
And we hover over hell
Our hearts become the instruments
We learn to play so well

Wealthy the spirit 
That knows its own flight
Stealthy the hunter 
Who slays his own fright
Blessed the traveler 
Who journeys the length of the light

Outside the pull of gravity
Beyond the spectral veil
Within our careful reasoning
We search to no avail
For the constant in the chaos
For the fulcrum in the void
Following a destiny
Our steps cannot avoid

Who slays his own fright

Who journeys the length of the light

In a spiral never-ending
Are we drawn towards the source
Spinning at the mercy 
Of an unrelenting force
So we stare into the emptiness
And fall beneath the weight
Circling the Nexus in a
Fevered dance with fate --

Wealthy the spirit 
That knows its own flight
Stealthy the hunter 
Who slays his own fright
Blessed the traveler 
Who journeys the length of the light

Dan Fogelberg,"Longer than ther've been fishes in the ocean
Higher than any bird ever flew
Longer than there've been stars up in the heavens
I've been in love with you

Stronger than any mountain cathedral
Truer than any tree ever grew
Deeper than any forest primeval
I am in love with you

I'll bring fire in the winters
You'll send showers in the springs
We'll fly through the falls and summers with love on our wings

Through the years as the fire starts to mellow
Burning lines in the book of our lives
Though the binding cracks
And the pages start to yellow
I'll be in love with you
I'll be in love with you

Longer than there've been stars up in the heavens

Dan Fogelberg,"I was walking alone through the loft
San Juans
With a heart full of light
And a head full of songs

I was thinking of time
And how much it will cost
To recapture the souls
That we surely have lost.

In the cities and towns
There are millions who dream
But the traffic's so loud
That you can't hear them scream

There's a heaven on earth
That so few ever find
Though the map's in your soul
And the road's in your mind.

So many mountains before us
So many rivers to cross
Where is the wisdom to bring
Back the vision we've lost?

Can we gaze with the wonder of children
Into the deafening night
Has it gotten so dark
That you cannot remember the light?

When you sleep on the ground
With the stars in your face
You can feel the full length
Of the beauty and grace.

In the wild places man
Is an unwelcome guest
But it's here than I'm found
And it's here I feel blessed",Aurora Nova,2012
Dan Fullerton,"And now the purple dusk of twilight time
Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb
Always reminding me that we're apart
You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms
The nightingale 
Tells his fairytale
Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain
My stardust melody
The memory of love's refrain.",Stardust,1998

Or it's quiet or it's mad,
It's a good thing or it's bad,
But beautiful!

Beautiful to take a chance
And if you fall, you fall,
And I'm thinking I wouldn't mind at all.
Love is tearful or it's gay.
It's a problem or it's play,
It's a heartache either way,
But beautiful!

And I'm thinking if you were mine
I'd never let you go,
And that would be but beautiful I know.",But Beautiful,2007
Dan Germain,"I took a trip on a train
And I thought about you
I passed a shadowy lane
And I thought about you

Moon shining down on some little town

And every stop that we made
Oh, I thought about you

Then I really felt blue

I peeped through the crack
Looked at the track

Our moment is swift, like ships adrift,
We're swept apart too soon.

Speak low, darling speak low,
Love is a spark lost in the dark,
Too soon, too soon,
I feel wherever I go
That tomorrow is near, tomorrow is here
And always too soon.

Time is so old and love so brief,
Love is pure gold and time a thief.

Dan Grissom,"The first time I saw you 
I knew at a glance
I was meant to be yours, yours alone.
As I stood before you
My heart seemed to dance.
And I prayed you would call me your own
When I look in your eyes 
I am thrilled to the skies
And I feel like a queen (king) on a throne,
The first time I saw you 
I knew at a glance,
I was meant to be yours, yours alone",The First Time I Saw You,1999
Dan Haerle,"East of the sun and west of the moon
We'll build a dream house of love dear
Close to the sun in the day
Near to the moon at night
We'll live in a lovely way dear
Sharing our love in the pale moonlight

Just you and I, 
Forever and a day
Love will not die, 
We'll keep it that way
Up among the stars 
We'll find a harmony of life to a lovely tune

Dan Haerle,"I wish I knew someone like you could love me
I wish I knew you place no one above me
Did I mistake this for a real romance?
I wish I knew, but only you can answer.

If you don't care, why let me hop[e and pray so
Don't lead me on, if I'm a fool just say so,
Should I keep dreaming on, or just forget you?
What shall I do, I wish I knew",I Wish I Knew,1996
Dan Haerle,"I took one look at you
That's all I meant to do
And then my heart stood still

My feet could step and walk
My lips could move and talk
And yet my heart stood still

Though not a single word was spoken
I could tell you knew
That unfelt clasp of hands
Told me so well you knew
I never lived at all
Until the thrill of that moment
When my heart stood still

I took one look at you
That's all I meant to do
And then my heart stopped right there

My feet could step and walk
My lips could move and talk
And yet my heart stood still

I could tell you knew
That unfelt claps of hands
Told me so well you knew
I never lived at all

When my heart stood still",My Heart Stood Still,1996
Dan Haerle,"Love is lovelier the second time around
Just as wonderful with both feet on the ground
It's that second time you hear your love song sung
Makes you think perhaps that love, like youth, is wasted on the young
Love's more comfortable the second time you fall
Like a friendly home the second time you call
Who can say what brought us to this miracle we've found?
There are those who'll bet  love comes but once, and yet
I'm oh, so glad we met the second time around

Dan Haerle,"Now won't you listen honey, while I say, 
How could you tell me that you're goin' away? 
Don't say that we must part, 
Don't break your baby's heart 

You know I've loved you for these many years, 
Loved you night and day,
Oh! honey baby, can't you see my tears? 
Listen while I say

After you've gone and left me cryin'
After you've gone there's no denyin'
You'll feel blue, you'll feel sad
You'll miss the dearest pal you've ever had

There'll come a time, now don't forget it
There'll come a time when you'll regret it
Someday, when you grow lonely
Your heart will break like mine and you'll want me only

After you've gone and left me cryin'
After you've gone there's no denyin'

Dan Haerle,"I'm always chasing rainbows
Watching clouds drifting by
My schemes are just like all my dreams
Ending in the sky
Some fellows look and find the sunshine
I always look and find the rain
Some fellows make a winning sometimes
I never even make a gain
Believe me, I'm always chasing rainbows
Waiting to find a little bluebird in vain

Dan Haerle,"You've heard all about your raggy melody
Everything from opera down to harmony
But I've a little song that I will sing to you
It's gonna win you through and through
There ain't much to the words but the music is grand
And you'll be a-singing it to beat the band
You've heard of the tisket and tasket it's true
But give a little listen to this will you?
 
Ja-Da, Ja-Da, Ja-Da, Ja-Da
Jing, Jing, Jing
Ja-Da, Ja-Da, Ja-Da, Ja-Da
Jing, Jing, Jing
That's a funny little bit of melody
It's so soothing and appealing to me
It goes Ja-Da, Ja-Da, Ja-Da, Ja-Da
Jing, Jing, Jing
 
Our bands have been digging back for tunes to be sung
Operas and nursery rhymes have been overdone
I dug a little deeper and I found this thing
It's ragtime but it still can swing
It ain't a turkeytrot or a shimmey onestep
But when grandma danced to it
She thought she was hep
It still is a ditty 
I'm sure you will find
Will keep a runnin' 'round and around your mind

Dan Haerle,"I want to take you to a little room
A little room where all the roses bloom
I want to lead you into Nature's hall
Where ev'ry year the roses give a ball
They have an orchestra up in the trees
For their musicians are the birds and bees
And they will sing us a song
As we are strolling along
 
In sunny Roseland, where summer breezes are playing
Where the honey bees are ""A-Maying""
There all the roses are swaying
Dancing while the meadow brook flows
The moon when shining is more than ever designing
For 'tis ever then I am pining
Pining to be sweetly reclining
Somewhere in Roseland
Beside a beautiful rose
 
The ball is over and tulips meet
Their little kisses are so short and sweet
The lilies nod to the forget-me-nots
When they're departing in their flower pots
But all the roses with their spirits high
Remain to love until they droop and die
And dear, why shouldn't it be
Just so with you and with me
 
In sunny Roseland, where summer breezes are playing
Where the honey bees are ""A-Maying""
There all the roses are swaying
Dancing while the meadow brook flows
The moon when shining is more than ever designing
For 'tis ever then I am pining
Pining to be sweetly reclining
Somewhere in Roseland
Beside a beautiful rose

Dan Haerle,"I hate to see that evening sun go down
I hate to see that evening sun go down
Cause my baby, he's gone left this town

Feelin' tomorrow like I feel today
If I'm feelin' tomorrow like I feel today
I'll pack my truck and make my give-a-way

St. Louis woman with her diamond ring
Pulls that man around by her, if it wasn't for her and her
That man I love would have gone nowhere, nowhere

I got the St. Louis blues, blues as I can be
That man's got a heart like a rock cast in the sea
Or else he wouldn't have gone so far from me

Like a Kentucky colonel loves his mint 'n rye

We've danced the whole night through
And daylight soon will be dawning
Just one more waltz with you
That melody so entrancing
Seems to be made for us two
I could just keep on dancing forever dear with you
 
There goes the three o'clock chime, chiming, rhyming
My heart keeps beating in time
Sounds like an old sweet love tune
Say that there soon will be a honeymoon

I let you
We broke the ties that bind
I wanted to forget you
And leave the past behind
Still, the magic of the night I met you

And high above
The moon was new
And so was love

Love had its day
That day is past
You've gone away

I walk along with you
