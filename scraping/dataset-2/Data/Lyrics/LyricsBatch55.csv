Chris Stainton,"Well, I've got to run to keep from hiding 
And I'm bound to keep on riding 
And I've got one more silver dollar 
But I'm not gonna let them catch me, no 
Not gonna let 'em catch the Midnight Rider 

And I don't own the clothes I'm wearing 
And the road goes on forever 
And I've got one more silver dollar 
But I'm not gonna let them catch me, no 
Not gonna let 'em catch the Midnight Rider 

And I've gone by the point of caring 
Some old bed I'll soon be sharing 
And I've got one more silver dollar 

[Repeat x3] 
But I'm not gonna let 'em catch me, no 
Not gonna let them catch the Midnight Rider",Midnight Rider,1976
Chris Stainton,"It was down by old Joe's barroom, on the corner of the square
They were serving drinks as usual, and the usual crowd was there
On my left stood Big Joe McKennedy, and his eyes were bloodshot red
And he turned his face to the people, these were the very words he said

I was down to St. James infirmary, I saw my baby there
She was stretched out on a long white table, 
So sweet, cool and so fair

Let her go, let her go, God bless her
Wherever she may be
She may search this whole wide world over
Never find a sweeter man as me

When I die please bury me in my high top Stetson hat
Put a twenty dollar gold piece on my watch chain
The gang'll know I died standing pat

Let her go, let her go God bless her
Wherever she may be
She may search this wide world over
Never find a sweeter man as me

I want six crapshooters to be my pallbearers
Three pretty women to sing a song
Stick a jazz band on my hearse wagon
Raise hell as I stroll along

Let her go Let her go
God bless her
Wherever she may be
She may search this whole wide
World over
She'll never find a sweeter
Man as me",St. James Infirmary,1976
Chris Stamey,"Instant Karma's gonna get you
Gonna knock you right on the head
You better get yourself together
Pretty soon you're gonna be dead
What in the world you thinking of
Laughing in the face of love
What on earth you tryin' to do
It's up to you, yeah you

Instant Karma's gonna get you
Gonna look you right in the face
You better get yourself together darling
Join the human race
How in the world you gonna see
Laughing at fools like me
Who on earth d'you think you are?
A superstar? Well right you are

Well we all shine on
Like the moon and the stars and the sun
Well we all shine on
Every one, come on

Instant Karma's gonna get you
Gonna knock you off your feet
Better recognize your brothers
Every one you meet
Why in the world are we here?
Surely not to live in pain and fear
Why on earth are you there?
When you're everywhere
Come and get your share

But we all shine on
Like the moon and the stars and the sun
And we all shine on
Come on and on and on on on

Yeah yeah, alright, ah haa, aaaahh  

But we all shine on
Like the moon and the stars and the sun
And we all shine on
On and on and on on and on
But we all shine on
Like the moon and the stars and the sun
But we all shine on",Instant Karma!,1983
Chris Stamey,"I can't believe it's Christmas time
Where is the year we left behind?
The summer went so fast
The fall went roaring past
And we watched it disappear

Last New Year had a master plan
And now it's Christmas time again
We went to every state
To find out just how great it is
Right here at home

Time stands still at Christmas
Always will at Christmas
How we feel at Christmas
Time stands still
Christmas time

I guess I let it get me down
You're far away in your hometown
I stayed out all night long
And when I saw the dawn it was
Wintergreen and red

Time stands still at Christmas
Always will at Christmas
How we feel at Christmas
Time stands still
Time stands still

Time stands still at Christmas
Always will at Christmas
How we feel at Christmas
How we feel at Christmas",Christmas Time,1986
Chris Stamey,"Shapes of things before my eyes
Just teach me to despise
Will time make men more wise?

Here within my lonely frame
My eyes just heard my brain
But will it seem the same?

Come tomorrow, will I be older?
Come tomorrow, may be a soldier
Come tomorrow, may I be bolder than today?

Now the trees are almost green
But will they still be seen
When time and tide have been?

Fallin' into your passing hands
Please don't destroy these lands
Don't make them desert sands

Come tomorrow, will I be older?
Come tomorrow, may be a soldier
Come tomorrow, may I be bolder than today?

Soon I hope that I will find
Thoughts deep within my mind
That won't displace my kind",Shapes of Things,2005
Chris Standring,"I'm not in love
So don't forget it
It's just a silly phase I'm going through
And just because
I call you up
Don't get me wrong, don't think you've got it made
I'm not in love, no no, it's because..

I like to see you
But then again
That doesn't mean you mean that much to me
So if I call you
Don't make a fuss
Don't tell your friends about the two of us
I'm not in love, no no, it's because..

I keep your picture
Upon the wall
It hides a nasty stain that's lying there
So don't you ask me
To give it back
I know you know it doesn't mean that much to me
I'm not in love, no no, it's because..

Ooh you'll wait a long time for me
Ooh you'll wait a long time
Ooh you'll wait a long time for me
Ooh you'll wait a long time

I'm not in love
So don't forget it
It's just a silly phase I'm going through
And just because I call you up
Don't get me wrong, don't think you've got it made
I'm not in love
I'm not in love",I'm Not in Love,2000
Chris Standring,"As around the sun the earth knows she's revolving
And the rosebuds know to bloom in early may
Just as hate knows love's the cure
You can rest your mind assure
That I'll be loving you always

As now can't reveal the mystery of tomorrow
But in passing will grow older every day
Just as all that's born is new
You know what I say is true
That I'll be loving you always

(Until the rainbow burns the stars out in the sky)
Always
(Until the ocean covers every mountain high)
Always
(Until the dolphin flies and parrots live at sea)
Always
(Until we dream of life and life becomes a dream)

Did you know that true love asks for nothing
No no her acceptance is the way we pay
Did you know that life has given love a guarantee
To last through forever and another day

Just as time knew to move on since the beginning
And the seasons know exactly when to change
Just as kindness knows no shame
Know through all your joy and pain
That I'll be loving you always

As today I know I'm living
But tomorrow could make me the past
But that I mustn't fear
For I'll know deep in my mind
The love of me I've left behind
'Cause I'll be loving you always

(Until the day is night and night becomes the day)
Always
(Until the trees and seas just up and fly away)
Always
(Until the day that eight times eight times eight is four)
Always
(Until the day that is the day that are no more)
Did you know you're loved by somebody
(Until the day the earth starts turnin' right to left)
Always
(Until the earth just for the sun denies itself)
I'll be lovin' you forever
(Until dear mother nature says her work is through)
Always
(Until the day that you are me and I am you)
Always
(Until the rainbow burns the stars out in the sky
Until the ocean severs every mountain high)
Always mm mm

We all know sometimes life hates and troubles
Can make you wish you were born in another time and space
But you can bet your lifetimes that and twice it's double
That God knew exactly where he wanted you to be placed
So make sure when you say you're in it, but not of it
You're not helpin' to make this earth
A place sometimes called hell
Change your words into truths
And then change that truth into love
And maybe our children's grandchildren
And their great grandchildren will tell
I'll be loving you until the rainbow burns the stars out in the sky",As,2006
Chris Standring,"Life is tough if you find you got it all and you're not satisfied
People try to lead you astray
But I ain't gonna fall for the games that they play
I know of the danger
I'm foolin' with strangers.
You
You are my one temptation
You
You are the one I've no resistance to.
Yeah
Honey
It's you
You are my one temptation
You give me the thrill that I'm addicted to.
You're my one temptation.
You can look
You can touch
Nothing is free if you pay too much
When there's talk on the street
And the pressure is hot to want more than you got.
I don't hear what they're saying
Day out and day in.
You
You are my one temptation
You
You are the one I've no resistance to.
Nobody knows you are my one temptation
You give me a thrill that I'm addicted to.
You're my one temptation.
Nothing ever happens till you show your face around
Can't let you see that you turn my world around.
My love lines grow and get too strong to say no.
You
You are my one temptation
You
You are the one I've no resistance to.
Yeah
Honey
It's you
You are my one temptation
You give me the thrill that I'm addicted to.
You're my one temptation.",My One Temptation,2017
Chris Stapleton,"Mesdames et messieurs, dévisagez vous-mêmes, The Blue Sea Band!

Now I'm gonna tell you a little story
About the stuff dreams are made of, heh heh heh!

I'll tell you when it started
I remember it was way back when
I sat there crying, my sister was sighing, my blanket was my only friend
Felt like it was hopeless
The baby food was grey and bland
I needed something yummy for my baby tummy, I needed to make a stand

Then suddenly I'm chewing on a slice of sheer delight
It was a snack worth snacking
My lips were smacking, my friends, I've seen the light!

(Cheese, please) that's all I gotta say
(Cheese, please) I eat it every day

Some people like it on a string
Some folks prefer it grilled
Pass me some Gouda, I'm always in the mood-a
I can never get my fill

Talkin' 'bout (cheese, please) that's what I love to eat
(Cheese, please) the taste that can't be beat

When I wake I scramble some into my morning meal
Later macaroni, some cheddar and baloney
Just depends on how I feel!

Cheese, please
That's what I feel like, just some cheese!
Any kind of cheese!
Mozzarella
Parmesan
Very easy!
Any kind of cheese
Just feed me some cheese

Swiss and Brie are cool with me, I love that Camembert
It feels so fine, ain't life divine
When you've got cheese to share!

Cheese, please, it satisfies my soul!
Talkin' 'bout cheese, please, I lose my self-control
Cheese, please, as much as I'm allowed
Cheese, please, the food that comes from cows
Moo!

Cheese
I love all kinds of cheese
I gotta have me some cheese
I love that cheese

Now listen, man, don't be puttin' cheese down
You ain't in Monterey, Jack
Yeah, yeah!",Cheese Please,2007
Chris Stapleton,"Tonight we'll have a party 
We'll eat some food that's rare
And at the head of the table 
We'll place brother Henry's chair
Invite all the local big dogs 
We'll laugh and talk and eat
But we'll save the bones for Henry Jones 'cause Henry don't eat no meat

Today I'll go to market 
And buy up a lotta fish
Well, that will thrill brother Henry 
'Cause fish is his special dish
Get a large can of molasses 
Have something sweet to eat
But we'll save the bones for Henry Jones 'cause Henry don't eat no meat

Henry don't like gravy
He don't dunk or dip
He don't need no napkins 'cause the things he eats don't drip, blip!

One day we had a banquet It really was a bake
They started off with short ribs any they finished off with steak
But when the feast was over 
Brother Henry just kept his seat
And we served the bones to Henry Jones 'cause Henry don't eat no meat

(Jackson)
Our dinner was most proper 
Right down to demitasse
From soup to lox and bagels 
And pheasant under glass 
We thought the chops were mellow 
And I said his chops were beat 
And we served the bones to Henry Jones
'Cause Henry don't eat no meat

He's an egg man (Henry don't eat no meat)
He loves his fish (Henry don't eat no meat)

Feel like a ballgame on a rainy day
Yes I do, yall

Don't you know I feel so bad
Lord like a ballgame on a rainy day

Whoa since I lost my woman
I shake my head and then I walk away
I have to walk away
(Y'all listen to this)

I just wanna tell you people
I wanna tell you just how I feel
I just wanna tell you people out there
I wanna tell you just how I feel, oh, how I feel

My woman gave me a dirty deal
The child messed up my mind

I got one more thing I want to talk to you about

Sometimes I want to leave it
Then again I want to stay
Do you hear what I say now?
Sometimes I want to leave it
Then again I want to stay

You see, the thing is

Chris Stapleton,"I put that record on
Girl you know what song
And I let it play again and again

You're in every line
Takes me back in time
Yeah tonight I'm wondering

What are you listening to
Is it a cover band in some college town bar
Where it's na-na-na's and air guitars

Or is it something to get you through
Just a sad song playing on the radio station
Tears still fall and hearts still breakin'

Cause you're hanging on
Or is it a love song about someone new
What are you listening to?

I like to believe
That you're just like me
Trying to figure out how a good thing goes bad

I don't know
I can't let it go
Yeah it's about to drive me mad

What are you listening to
Is it a cover band in some college town bar
Where it's na-na-na's and air guitars

And is it something to get you through
Just a sad song playing on the radio station
Tears still fall and hearts still breakin'

Cause you're hanging on
Or is it a love song about someone new
What are you listening to

Is it a feel good song gets you driving too fast
The one that gets you moving on pass to pass
Or the kind you can’t help singing along
Singing whoa

Is it headphones on on a downtown train
Or a window seat on an outbound plane
Is it LA sunny and Memphis blue
I wish I knew I wish I knew

What are you listening to
Is it a cover band in some college town bar
Where it's na-na-na's and air guitars

And is it something to get you through
Just a sad song playing on the radio station
Tears still fall and hearts still breakin'

Cause you're hanging on
Or is it a love song about someone new
What are you listening to

And I let it play again and again",What Are You Listening To?,2013
Chris Stapleton,"Well it might be me, might be the whiskey
We might be loving, we might be tipsy
Tomorrow morning might hurt real bad
So lets make tonight last

We’ve been hanging around this place (hanging around)
Hanging on to the hope and the way this whiskey tastes (whiskey tastes)
Waiting, Wising that you’d say
""Hell with being sober, I want a hangover tonight""
Feelings getting stronger (stronger), how can this be wrong girl (wrong girl)
All night long, girl, I want a hangover tonight.

Well I might make a move and it might be risky
I’ll take one more shot if you’ll take one with me
Get a little closer in a cab outside,
Lets take a ride (ride with me baby)

Chris Stapleton,"I used to spend my nights out in a barroom
Liquor was the only love I've known
But you rescued me from reachin' for the bottom
And brought me back from being too far gone

You're as smooth as Tennessee whiskey
You're as sweet as strawberry wine
You're as warm as a glass of brandy
And honey, I stay stoned on your love all the time

I've looked for love in all the same old places
Found the bottom of a bottle always dry
But when you poured out your heart I didn't waste it
'Cause there's nothing like your love to get me high

He used to fold his hands and bow his head down to the floor

Chris Stapleton,"They say ""Love is more precious than gold""
Can't be bought and it can't be sold
I got love enough to spare
That makes me a millionaire

I got a woman with eyes that shine
Down deep as a diamond mine
She's my treasure so very rare
She's made me a millionaire

When we ride around, ride around this old town
In the beat-up car, with the windows down
People look at her and they look at me
And say ""That boy is sure living in luxury""
Sweet luxury

'Cause love is more precious than gold
It can't be bought, no, never could be sold
I got love enough to share
That makes me a millionaire

When the kisses fall from everywhere
Life reaches on, millionaire
When the pocket's are empty and the cupboard is bare
I still feel like a millionaire

Pursuin' the life of my hard-ridin' heroes
I burned up my childhood days

I learned all the rules of a modern-day drifter
Don't you hold on to nothin' too long
Take what you need from the ladies and then leave them

From being alone too long
You can die from the cold in the arms of a nightmare
Knowin' well that your best days are gone

I let the words of my youth fade away
Old worn-out saddles and old worn-out memories

She kissed all her friends goodbye and she rowed away
Rain came down on Kingston, we stood silent
She will reach the sea in a couple of days

Will you keep the picture safe?
We will keep the picture safe

I went climbing mountains, high above the city
Looking at the river stretched out like a map below
All her friends were scattered to the corners
Nobody understood why she had to go

I will get my story straight
We will keep the picture safe

On the evening news a mother drowned her baby
As I sat there, I knew who to blame
Halfway down Embankment, hope was fading
Truth is nothing, will ever be the same

I will never see her again
We couldn't keep the picture safe

Watch the picture float away

As the steamer pulled away

As across the coast they filed
Standing firm between them

Brought a might metal war-lord
Crashing down in sheets of flame

Sensing victory was nearing
Thinking fortune must have smiled

Cutting down one of the tripod figures 
Instantly, the others raised their Heat Rays 
And melted the Thunder Child's valiant heart

Lashing ropes and smashing timbers
Flashing Heat Rays pierced the deck
Dashing hopes for our deliverance
As we watched the sinking wreck
With the smoke of battle clearing
Over graves in waves defiled
Slowly disappearing
Farewell Thunder Child!
Slowly disappearing
Farewell Thunder Child! [Repeat x 2]

And Carrie was safe

And no one and nothing was left now to fight them

Madman drummers bummers and Indians in the summer with a teenage diplomat
In the dumps with the mumps as the adolescent pumps his way into his hat
With a boulder on my shoulder, feelin' kinda older, I tripped the merry-go-round
With this very unpleasing sneezing and wheezing, the calliope crashed to the ground
Some all-hot half-shot was headin' for the hot spot, snappin' his fingers, clappin' his hands
And some fleshpot mascot was tied into a lover's knot with a whatnot in her hand
And now young Scott with a slingshot finally found a tender spot and throws his lover in the sand
And some bloodshot forget-me-not whispers, daddy's within earshot, save the buckshot, turn up the band

He says, dethrone the dictaphone, hit it in its funny bone, that's where they expect it least
And some new-mown chaperone was standin' in the corner all alone, watchin' the young girls dance
And some fresh-sown moonstone was messin' with his frozen zone to remind him of the feeling of romance

Yeah, he was blinded by the light
Oh, cut loose like a deuce, another runner in the night

He got down but he never got tight, but he's gonna make it tonight

Some silicone sister with her manager's mister told me I got what it takes
She said, I'll turn you on, sonny, to something strong if you play that song with the funky break
And Go-Cart Mozart was checkin' out the weather chart to see if it was safe to go outside
And little Early-Pearly came by in her curly-wurly and asked me if I needed a ride
Oh, some hazard from Harvard was skunked on beer, playin' backyard bombardier
Yes, and Scotland Yard was trying hard, they sent some dude with a calling card, he said, do what you like, but don't do it here
Well, I jumped up, turned around, spit in the air, fell on the ground and asked him which was the way back home
He said, take a right at the light, keep goin' straight until night, and then, boy, you're on your own
And now in Zanzibar, a shootin' star was ridin' in a side car, hummin' a lunar tune
Yes, and the avatar said, blow the bar but first remove the cookie jar, we're gonna teach those boys to laugh too soon
And some kidnapped handicap was complainin' that he caught the clap from some mousetrap he bought last night
Well, I unsnapped his skull cap and between his ears I saw a gap but figured he'd be all right

Each time you break away, I fear you've gone to stay.
Lonely nights that come, memories that flow, bringing you back again,
Hurting me more and more.

'Cause each day that passes by you got me
Never knowing if I'm coming or going, but I, I love you.

Chris Thompson,"There were ships of shapes and sizes
Scatter out along the bay
And I thought I heard her calling
As the steamer pulled away
The Invaders must have seen them
As across the coast they filed
Standing firm between them
There lay Thunder Child

Moving swiftly through the waters
Cannons blazing as she came
Brought a might metal war-lord
Crashing down in sheets of flame

Sensing victory was nearing
Thinking fortune must have smiled
People started cheering
""Come on Thunder Child""
""Come on Thunder Child""

The Martians released their black smoke, but the ship sped on, 
Cutting down one of the tripod figures 
Instantly, the others raised their Heat Rays 
And melted the Thunder Child's valiant heart

Lashing ropes and smashing timbers
Flashing Heat Rays pierced the deck
Dashing hopes for our deliverance
As we watched the sinking wreck
With the smoke of battle clearing
Over graves in waves defiled
Slowly disappearing
Farewell Thunder Child!
Slowly disappearing
Farewell Thunder Child! [Repeat x 2]

When the smoke had cleared, the little steamer had reached the misty horizon, 
And Carrie was safe
But the Thunder Child had vanished forever, 
Taking with her man's last hope of victory
The leaden sky was lit by green flashes, cylinder following cylinder, 
And no one and nothing was left now to fight them
The Earth belong to the Martians.

Born this happy morning,

Chris Tomlin,"O holy night,
The stars are brightly shining;
It is the night of
Our dear Savior's birth!
Long lay the world
In sin and error pining,
Till He appeared
And the soul felt its worth.
A thrill of hope,
The weary world rejoices,
For yonder breaks
A new and glorious morn.
Fall on your knees,
O hear the angel voices!
O night divine,
O night when Christ was born!
O night divine, O night,
O night divine!

Led by the light of Faith
Serenely beaming,
With glowing hearts
By His cradle we stand.
So led by light of a star
Sweetly gleaming,
Here came the wise men
From Orient land.
The King of Kings lay thus
In lowly manger,
In all our trials
Born to be our Friend!
He knows our need,
To our weakness no stranger;
Behold your King!
Before the lowly bend!
Behold your King! your King!
Before Him bend.

Truly He taught us
To love one another;
His law is love and
His gospel is peace.
Chains shall He break
For the slave is our brother
And in His name
All oppression shall cease.
Sweet hymns of joy in
Grateful chorus raise we,
Let all within us
Praise His holy name!
Christ is the Lord,
Oh praise His name forever,
His pow'r and glory evermore proclaim
His pow'r and glory
Evermore proclaim.","O, Holy Night",2009

Breathe on me, breath of God, breathe on me
I come alive, I’m alive when you breathe on me

Awake my soul

Then He said to me
Prophesy to these bones and say to them
Dry bones, hear the word of the Lord!
This is what the sovereign Lord says to these bones
I will make breath enter you
And you will come to life
So I prophesied as I was commanded
As I was prophesying, there was a noise, a rattling sound
And the bones came together, bone to bone
And I looked, and tendons and flesh appeared on them
And skin covered them, but there was no breath in them
Then He said to me
Prophesy to the breath
Prophesy, son of man, and say to it
Conjure the four winds of breath and breathe

Awake, awake, awake my soul
God resurrect these bones
From death to life, through you alone
Awake my soul

Awake, awake, awake my soul
God resurrect these bones
From death to life, through you alone
Awake my soul

Yeah, I’m not alone, I realize
I breathe out, I come alive
Your word gives life to my dry bones
Your breath tells death it can ride on

A song of old San Antone
Where in dreams I live with a memory
Beneath the stars all alone
It was there I found beside the Alamo
Enchantment strange as the blue up above
A moonlit pass that only she would know
Still hears my broken song of love
Moon in all your splendor know only my heart
Call back my rose, rose of San Antone
Lips so sweet and tender like petals falling apart
Speak once again of my love, my own.
Broken song, empty words I know
Still live in my heart all alone
For that moonlit pass by the Alamo
And Rose, my Rose of San Antone

Chris Velan,"It was the year of our father
Nineteen-hundred and seventy-six in JA
When I first met my Mary, quite contrary to what
My mother did say
She was a mountain girl come to Spanish Town
I was only there for a while
But when I think back on all the love we shared
I just can't but help to smile
We spent one whole long year together
And at the end, I had to go
By my Mary's side, I wept and cried
I'd never been laid so low
She said, Boy when you first met me
You were as green as a mango tree
Hmm, but now you are a man, go back to your land
But first listen carefully 
You can smoke two pounds of Cali herb by yourself then
Try to stand on your head
No matter how high you get, you'll never forget
The wonders of Mary's bed

Now my Mary's sweet smell was in my nose
And her vision, it robbed me blind
And as I crossed the sea, it occurred to me
That I left myself behind
She was my natural mystic, sweet sugarplum
I still ask, why did I go
They say your first love is your hardest love
And I'd have to say that's so
And it's a day and another day and a way and another way
Had a family once but they're gone
Now it don't strike me as weird, there's grey in my beard
But her words still linger on

Now there's nothing for me left here 'cept some broken dreams
Disappointments, I've had a few
But there's this place I know where the mangroves grow
And there's just one thing left to do
I'll go back to my Mary's bed, plant a kiss on her head
And pretend that time just stood still
Then I can live out my life like it should have been
And the rest will be what it will
So I went back to the bar where we first met
Asked the bartender, where could she be
And as he poured me a beer, he said, last year
She left this world peacefully
Then every man in the bar looked at me
They said, old man don't you see
That we were all touched by Mary just like you
Now she lives on in our memories 
And we all can smoke two pounds of Cali herb by ourselves then
Try to stand on our heads
No matter how high we get, we'll never forget
The wonders of Mary's bed
And we can run two hundred miles through a ganja field until
All we see is red
And we can shout it out, were still thinking about
The wonders of Mary's bed
And so we sing, jump around sweet Mary
You know we all have to move along
You never know what you've got in this cruel world
Until you realize it's gone.",Sweet Mary,2003

Where I gently placed her in it
I brought her soul to ease with kisses

For sometimes I am ailing
And yet in steaming night I smile
To downplay this my failing
And make a noise to bury all
Of your weeping and your wailing

And then in bed by little light
And closed off from it all
I must try and bring a conscious end to night
And hope that dreams begin to fall

The color of my dreams, they would be you...ruby
Oh if I could close my eyes and bring you to me
Push your head into
Make you not you not you not you but me

And then in dreams I wander free
And see some things I'm meant to see
And sometimes even I see thee

And would the night go on and on
And not tomorrow end at dawn
And whatever mat I lay upon
Dissolve

The color of my dreams, if I had dreams, they would be you...ruby
Everything I do is done to bring you closer to me
When you sleep your breath it blows right on through me

Sleep walking away
Take my hand, follow me

To kill the demons at night
Has left me with no place to hide

Face down on the floor
Can't take anymore
Gave it all away 
Lately I can't find the eyes
Help me realize

Chris Wall,"""Here's a song about every cowboy's real first love. 
It's not his horse, it's not his girl, and it's not his pick-up truck. 
Where have I heard that before? 
I sing this song a little different everywhere I go. 
This is the way them old boys down in Texas like to hear it.""

I was born and raised way out west
But the thing I love 'bout livin' here best
It ain't the mountains, the valleys, the hats, or the boots
It's havin' plenty of guns and something to shoot

We got shotguns and sixguns, we got a shipload of guns
Shootin varments and critters, is a shitload of fun
I don't care about the money, I don't care about the loot
Give me Jack Daniel's whiskey and something to shoot

Now there's a whole herd of elk, right there in a line
But it's a pain in the ass to shoot 'em one at a time
And I'm way below quota; I've had a bad day
Boy what I wouldn't give for just one hand grenade

I don't care about the future, I don't care about the past
As long as I've got some creatures to blast
We got deer, we got elk, we got ol' owls that hoot
And when I've killed them all, they'll be Yankees to shoot

Don' 'cha tailgate me son get off my back
I gotta thirty-ought-six right here in the rack
And this ain't New Jeresy; We don't honk, we don't yell
And if you touch that bumper I'll blow you to hell

""Everybody sing a long with me now""
I was born and raised way out west
And the thing like 'bout livin' here best
It ain't the mountains, the valleys, the hats, or the boots

Chris Walla,"You are 'Sir', you're a senator
And senator, you were right
It's just a law, not the word, not the law
I'm learning how to speak again

These words are only structures
When you choose to frame them in
And obviously, the framers would agree
You own a chair and you are not there you noble senator

Oh, dear sir, I'm a librarian
And while I do not know of law
I know the things that make my stomach pitch and yaw
If I were gavaged on hunger strike

Wrongly fired upon or sullied blindly by dogs
I'd hate us too and that's why I've cornered you
Roman senator, can you still hear
With all the marks on your ears?

Face me now
I want to see you break it down
I want to feel our stars colliding
I want to see the sweat pour from your brow

I'll let it go
You're gonna see me lose control
We do not fight for isolation
Have you seen the injuries?

I want to see
Your heart of gold again
Your heart of gold
We are kind

Do you remember that?
I wanna see your pro-life
Bear no exception
You grand, old senator

Oh, dear sir, I'm a librarian
And I am not always right
But ours is the story
Of the archer and the light

",Archer V. Light,2008
Chris Walla,"Colorado, can you hear me?
Are you listening, are you even there?
Colorado, are you listening?
Do you hear me, do you even care?

The concrete canopy, mountains of symmetry
The city policy, the city air
The burroughs I've seen seem so unfair
Still the feathers on the sidewalks I find there

I do not need to speak, but I wanna listen
To the tiniest of flights in their transmissions
The words tied to their wings
Well, they're the words I'm gonna sing
The noise, small and strong and a bird is a song

Torch the sails and set fire to our deals
My heaven is here, my heaven is here
Who would need escape, who would seek salvation
From a place so bright and clear?

I do not need to see but I need a vision
A once seamless operation upon ignition
The fuel that I sought away
Will keep us through the darkest of days
Will keep us well through winter's long
And when springtime starts to broadcast birds are our song

Keep your feathers clean and dry
Keep your feathers clean and dry

",A Bird Is a Song,2008
Chris Walla,"A chance to breathe
Everyone breathe
The news is hard, the days are long
And still we breathe

Everybody on the border towns
Your radios, your northern sounds
Fly your banners from the line
A thousand miles long

It is uneasy here
But we need everybody on

A band of thieves has ruined the bar
You, crooked barrister, arranged the calls
Your life of service is worthless
If you've ever served at all

Raise up now your lone star
We'll watch the pieces fall

Everybody on the boundary wires
Your telephones, your signal fires
Keep your balance on the line
A thousand miles long

It is not easy here
But we need everybody on board now
Don't fall away

There is no crime if you say
What you mean to say

Everybody on the border ties
Your mission bells, your desert skies
Draw your power from the line
A thousand miles long

It is uneasy here
But we need everybody on

",Everybody On,2008
Chris Walla,"This device in my hand
Well, it does not understand
How I need to talk with you
Oh, I need you now

And even the mobilest phone
Will leave you exactly alone
When the sea decides
To commandeer the land

Oh, everyone needs a home
Everybody needs a place to go
A sympathetic ear when you're on hold, oh, oh

Every girl needs a roof and a bed, and bright, bright light
That she can turn off at night
And fall asleep with the love of her life, oh, oh

A catastrophic lonely collapse
A conspiracy of maps
Sweet Louise, two days from side to side

Daunting, dear, it's true
But this flood will not keep me from you
Pull my picture from your wallet now and sing

Well, everyone needs a home
Everybody needs a place to go
A FEMA trailer does not ease the blow, oh, no

Every boy needs a roof and bed, and bright, bright light
That he can turn off at night
And fall asleep with the love of his life, oh, oh

Everyone needs a home
Everybody needs a place to go
A sympathetic voice when you feel alone, oh oh

All I need is a roof and a bed, and a bright, bright light
That I can turn off at night
Fall asleep with the love of my life, oh, oh
I fall asleep with the love of my life, oh, oh

",Everyone Needs a Home,2008
Chris Walla,"It used to bother me, all the shapes I can't describe
How we all fit together like wordless versing
And da-dee-dum-dum, da-dee-dum-dum, da-dee-dum
I was there, I saw you searching the corners for your light
But it's not there, it was never there
In files and books, a void of there in your heart fails your mind

This is the geometry, this is the life of you and I
How we fall for a second together and down we're singing
Da-dee-dum-dum, da-dee-dum-dum, da-dee-dum
It's a college, a connection and made to find the light
And it's brighter than we remember it being the last time we tried, we tried

You don't need to speak just now
You should keep it down and let that ticker pound

Let your heart keep the time
Keep the time, keep the time
The loudest part is in control, whoa

Let your heart keep the time
Keep the time, keep the time
The hardest part is letting go, whoa

Let your heart keep the time
Yeah whoa, yeah whoa

Let your heart keep the time

",Geometry & C,2008
Chris Walla,"I was busy, I was occupied
I was burning the fields
A wind of black was blowing over me
And when the cilia revealed

All the ash lining my lungs
I heard a song, I heard a whispering
I gave my torch to the flame
I counted out the numbers silently

A list of places and names
That I'd best get back to, at least
Were I soon to find leave or release?
To sing again, now and then, now at least

On to death and on to dignity
On to flowering the grave
On to faith and on to piety
On to sending away

All the tools our dynasty yields
All these papers and axles and wheels
On to quiet, on to silence
On to still

It's not unsustainable

So don't even try to explain me away
We can make it, love
We can bend at the knee, we can fall
And still we can recover

It's not unsustainable
Don't say it
It's not unsustainable

",It's Unsustainable,2008
Chris Walla,"You've got the pen
And we've done the typing
Why can't you get us all for good?
Let's put it in writing

On and on we argue so
Sirens blare and the whistles blow
'Til we cannot hear anymore
This is the score, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

We've found the bear
Or are we both fighting?
Why do we prance our little flag around
As if he's not biting?

On and on we bled so long
Now the bodies rise and our limbs are gone
And we cannot swim anymore
This is the score, oh, oh, oh, oh

Now I'm a chase
My colors are falling
Two nations were removed
From where the resistance is calling

On and on we're fractured now
They're bound to ship those children out
And on and on, no end in sight, now enjoy them
Don't wait for any call for me to see
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
This is the score

",The Score,2008
Chris Walla,"It was not tricky to enjoy
A cigarette in hand was the key to understanding
To seek out and to destroy
The mindless oversights, a string of faithless nights

We sing again
Sing together with quiet eyes
I'd lower my chin to my chest
I thought that would be best

Another pattern of the bricks
Bundles of cells dividing and South Dakota driving
The very darkest, dirty tricks
If we still cared at all we'd send a battle call

We sing again
Sing together with fiery eyes
A rangle alive in our chests
No, this is not a test

Let's sing again
Sing together without disguise
Let's raise up a song in unrest
I think that would be best

Here's to poison
You will hear the noises
You will feel the breaking
It's all yours for the taking

A life packed full of mindless joy
And it's not easy to enjoy, oh

",Sing Again,2008
Chris Walla,"St. Modesto
You were the ground line humming
You were the thread of fire upon this night

You could feel the living
You staggered and blew your money
A summery tailwind there upon our heels
Ooh, me and you, me and you

Down the valley
You'd drag me along for measure
The boredom was deafening at any speed

Still I could hear your breathing
You were as loud as the engine's gravel
Winding through Altamont, towards the sea
Ooh, you and me

If you're the one who can save this broken wreck
Then this is the end, we'll be through soon I suspect
Don't argue, these are facts

San Francisco
Eighty and four miles later
We were the vapor trails among the hills

There above us
An antenna of God, a broadcast
The table of contents right down through the trees
We were the pixels on the fallen leaves, oh, what do we do?

Are you the one
Who can save this gory mess?
I know you're a friend
You've been right and true I guess, I guess

I know you'd take one on the chin
You'd take it in the teeth for me
We are a team, but we are untied

I'm sinking with the weight of all the things I cannot do
But when I'm losing it, when I'm losing it
I know you're losing it too

You were the guitar I'm strumming
You were the power cord that made the light

",St. Modesto,2008
Chris Walla,"How long should I hold out the hope that I'm still in your heart?
When should I concede that the best of my years were apart from you?

I turn half an ocean to see how it feels in your arms
I lead into every reflection I put for the part from you

And I will look for you, til they put us both back in the ground
And I will call for you

Weren't you looking nice the young boy that you count for dead
I wonder how much you regret that they got me away from you

And I will look for you, until they put us both back in the ground
And I will call for you, until my throat cannot make a sound
And I will look for you, til they put us both back in the ground

[Mike D]
Nigga, Nigga, Nigga that's me! (That Mike D!)
On the trill you dummies!
Froze up the whole block on dots and a hummy
Young mommies want a hog that ain't cuffing the puttee

They want a jigga with figures sittin' swole with them goodies
So follow me now to the land of the brick lick hitters
Go getters and wig splitters and a little game that gives shivers
Playboy how you figure you can step to a hog

Let off a hundred rounds drums punishing you and yo dogs
My platoon issue wounds that don't heal up
Nigga when the Mack-9 reel up you better throw your shield up
We dope runners and cake runners 

All out big head hunters three glots and sixin it off the chain young stunners
Better slow down lil daddy before you fuck around and get pegged
Run you off like a scared dog with your tail between your legs 
want to be a baller when this G-shit go down
This my time when I clown that yo click out in one rhyme

[Chorus: x2]

[H.A.W.K]
I'm a outlaw (outlaw)
I'll bring it to you raw
Southpaw (southpaw) bone knuckles to the jaw
Above the law and all military forces

A hustler run the block like obstacle courses
I stand taller than Sasquatch
Rolex my wrist watch
And when the gloat cock it's strictly head shots

If a nigga got beef I knock out teeth
Steal you like a thief make the asswhippin' brief
Bring your family grief if the situation is getting sticky
My trigger fingers itchy cause my business is risky

You better not miss me (don't miss me)
Or you ass is history (Bye-bye!)
Yella tape the lot on an unsolved mystery
I can't deny pull more stunts than fog eye

Snitch and you'll die like bacon you will fry
My alibi ""I wasen't even on the scene""
But bullet shells left a trail from the M-16

[Chris Ward]
I'm one of the ones (that's me)
That's an usual suspect
A thug that hang on an infested drug set
And stack chips, stay strap and pack clips

With hollow tips that will make you niggas do backflips
And If we go toe to toe I'll break your jaw
In three or four places like I break the law
Ghetto dope man yellow stone smokes man

Got killers and dealers on my team from here to Oakland
That's movin' more powder than Johnson and Johnson
I'm a death wish to niggas just like Charles Bronson
I'm uncut and lethal like LSD

Cocaine mixed with acid and PCP
Rap game assassin 
If I raise I blast and bury niggas six feet deep in the grass
So if anybody ask
Tell Chris Ward is dangerous

With a star at the bar twisted cigar, while the X got her body popping
Everybody's chopping, on bottles of dro

Pulling yellow bones, me and my nigga from Yellow Stone
Putting digits in our two-way pagers, and telephones

I love pussy, but I don't really need it baby
Before I give up my do', I'ma leave it baby
I ain't saving these hoes, better believe it baby

Some of these hoes, got class and respect
But most of these hoes, trying to cash them a check
Bottom line, all about the Benjamin's
She'll sleep with ya quick, if you drop dividends
And it's a lot of cake, niggaz complying
Giving hoes all they cash, cause these bitches are fine
Fool last motherfucker, look at the picture
If you was broke with no hope, would this chick be with ya
Hell naw, I can answer that
She'll sleep with ya partna, if she think he got stacks
And that's a fact, cause I done seen it with my own fucking eyes
Hoes trying to play they role, while getting boned 'tween the thighs
For real, cause all boppers the same
Quick to hop on ya dick, cause you got you some change
Don't get me wrong, I ain't hating on the real women
I'm just tired of these crumbs, that be penny pinching but uh

You see me, I've been pimping ever since pimping been pimping
And when boppers see me they yell, (hey pimping)
And it's good you got the freak bitch, hair and nails done
I done hate ya, I congratulate ya well done
I'm all about my mail, hun
And if you ask about the next man bitch, I can't tell ya nuttin'
And while you half-sleep in the morning, waking up on the phone
I'm in the Presidential suite, waking up to some dome
I see ya always happy, I'm sorry for breaking up ya home
But if you plex, I send bullets that'll break up ya bones
So leave me alone, and back-back back-back
Cause I'm C. Weezy, the young black Mack with fat stacks

Than crack head crews, standing on the corner you'd find
I don't call my bitch my wifey, I call her my bitch
And my bitch know when I'm calling, I'm calling to hit
I keep a dime shotgun, while I'm making my runs
I bless 'em with my presence, never ever my funds
I got broads that's ghetto, broads that's seditty
But if the broad with me, then the broad is pretty
With big ass and titties, on the scale a dime
But if I'm out of time, I might settle for a nine
I love money, pussy and sticky green
I keep a all star team, that love to lick me clean
I know they want me for my green, I'ma let 'em stay wanting
At the mall they bags empty, and the Boss stay flaunting
And I do it, with a straight face
And if the chick jump fly, then the chick get replaced

I need a dime like J-Lo, Vivica Fox
Put ice in her life, and some nice invisible rocks
Kyleon, the type that never like trashy chicks
No strippers just Moet sippers, classy chicks
The kind, that I can't let walk pass me chick
Do anything for her, as long as she ask me chick
Like flashy shit, DG Prada and Gucci clothes
And Victoria Secret silk panties, covers and ooh she knows
She never hang with movie hoes, dig dealers and X popping
She's not a bopper, that say she hop out of Lex droppers
She my sex doctor, good love she go hard in bed
Go down below my waist with her lips, and harden my head
I call her the warden in bed, she keep me on lock
Not only her, it's my game she keep me on top
A bad broad, she just might keep me on bops
But she love for daddy to hustle, that's why she keep me on blocks
That's why I love her mayn, uh

I need a dime broad, top of the line broad
A fine broad, fuck up a nigga mind broad
(I need a classy chick, mean a sassy chick
And when it's time to get freaky, she a nasty chick)
I need a play girl, down around the way girl
More than okay girl, help me get my pay girl
(I need a gangsta bitch, not a wanksta bitch
That's down to ride, but never in some gangsta shit)

[Slim Thug]
I need some'ing classy in the streets, but stone freak in the sheets
Caramel color, letter under six feet
Stand tall like a model, shaped like a Coke bottle
Smile, will make the hardest thug heart feel hollow
When she pass boys follow, trying to get at my chick
Richie Rich himself, couldn't get in my bitch
She not impressed by cash, boo got her own stash
Boo got her own house, bought her own S Class
Independent lady, still up for the babies
Could be the house wife or the Boss type, it's crazy
My boo go to church, three days a week
My boo put God first, everyday she see
She never dug, hanging out in the club
By ten she tucked in, waiting on Thug
Never hating on Thug, or what Thug do
Cause Thug would be a fool, if Thug don't stay tru to my boo

Even though it ain't Hova, breathe easy baby
It's the realest of the real, see-Weezie baby

Only like modeling chicks, that's sleezy baby
Now um come closer, squeeze me baby
Get all that you can get, just release me baby
See I never cry to hoes, I just talk fly to hoes
Usually lie to hoes, bout buying 'em Prada clothes
If I do soon as they trip, they strip up out of those
Back to the sto' refund time, cause that's just how it goes
Now you know, I fuck 'em and leave 'em duck 'em and weave em
Listen to they sad stories, never fucking believe em
She got me sprung, waking up in the evening
Cause the night was incredible, sex was great she's unforgettable
The thought of her is endless, I just can't let it go
Therefor she's earned the position, to be that one I will settle fo'

Sometimes I ask myself, what is life like
What would I be without this rap, without a mic life
Or will I die young, like my partna Mike like
Won't get to see my girl grow, and see what a wife's like
But my life's alright, no I ain't finished yet
I just got started, I ain't ready to end it yet
I'm 24 years old, I ain't even beginned it yet
I just started having money, I ain't got a chance to spend it yet
I want to be a millionaire, but I'm losing my life line
My ticket out this ghetto, is for me to write rhymes
I know I can get this money, if I write rhymes
Opportunity knocked for me, at the right time
Cause I was losing hope, getting sick of this bullshit
Losing my faith, not listening to preachers and bull pits
God pulled my card quick, nope no more pain mayn
Sunshine for now, no more rain mayn

[Slim Thug]
I grew up around a bunch of gang bangers, and caine slangers
Stayed in danger, cause I played with strangers
Was born and raised by gangstas, taught by the hood
Proud of my block, everyday fought for the hood
Stand up kid, ain't too many did what I did
Saw half the shit I saw, or lived like I lived
When my mama went to work, my brother went to work
In the kitchen, pyrex shifting till it hurt
I watched him grind, fascinated by the cash
Patiently waiting, for my time to mash
Never tagged along, see I had my own gang
We had our own ideas, on how to get this change
We did our own thang, small time hustling
Some young niggaz, never asking for nothing
It ain't take us long, to peep what's going on
The broke niggaz was weak, while the rich was strong we got it on

[Lil Mel]
By all means I had to get it, I'm a hustler black
This rap thing what I dreamed, don't want to fuck with crack
But damn, being broke I can't fuck with that
And being po' ain't what I hoped, so I hustled stack
Have nuts have money, that's the code in these streets
And when my money got low, I was holding the heat
I'm just a young nigga living, trying to sip and ball
And even though these streets wet, I can't slip and fall
I ran with killas pull triggas, up out they stacks fo'
And if they broke, they hitting your back do' with the Mackno
Fuck worrying bout haters, cause that'll freeze em up
That's what the heat is for, guaranteed to heat em up
These streets bad and yeah lil' daddy, from has-fect
A young nigga could lose his life, over a glass set
It'll take a cell in a jail, for us to do some mad thinking
That's how it is that's how it go, I know it's sad ain't it

[Chris Ward]
You gotta know, that you can't take your life for granted
Cause it's a loaded game, out here on this lifeless planet
Smoke till my eyes get slanted, just to focus better
Thinking over pass times, when I wrote this letter
I just hope it gets better, for the future's sake
Trying not to make the mistakes, that I use to make
Been out in the streets, since the age of 17
And witnessed all type of bullshit, most have never seen
Damn near homeless, I slept on flo's slept in cars
Been through all kind of battles, nigga just check my scars
My backgrounds my resume, and my repitwa
That's why I walk the way I talk nigga, and wreck this hard
Please God, no more rainy days just sunshine
Cause me and my homies tired, of ducking one times
If I could I promise, I will put this gun down
But how can I, when I'm a soldier on the frontline",It's So,2004
Chris Ward,"Close your lips and open your ears, for a change
You just might, learn some thangs
I don't understand your plan, let me get this right
You broke, but you grinding all day and night

You on the block pushing caine, with Jordan's and a chain
I know, everybody want to have nice things
But man, you must think the dope game is a game
Fuck around and have yourself, catching a chain

Better stash you some cash, for a rainy day man
Cause only God knows, what tomorrow bring
Better listen, I'm trying to stop a lot of sorrow and pain
'Cause falling on your ass, is a horrible thing

Better learn from the mistakes, of the Outlaw gang
I been there done that, fought that won that
Lost that and got it right back, you better listen

Open your ears and just listen (yeah I hear you mayn)
Get off your ass and do something (yeah I hear you mayn)

It's more than one way out here, to get that do'
It don't take a rocket scientist, to get that bro
You can get that fast, get that slow
Hit licks with that grass, with that blow

Or with that pads, spit that flow
Or gamble with it, try to get back mo'
Uh-uh not me, I refuse to lose
You either got it or you don't, and I refuse to choose

And candy blue's I cruise, cause if I snooze I lose
And if I get out there bad, I just use my tools
My mind and muscle, that helps me grind and hustle
If it wasn't for this rap, I'd try to find a hustle

Why niggers sitting on they behind, steady trying to hustle
24/7-3/65, my time to hustle
I'd be a dealer out here, I got dimes and shuffles
Kyleon, is what really defines the hustle, just listen mayn

[Chorus: x2]

You need to quit talking so much, for a minute and hush
Stop trying to throw down boy, why you in such a rush
You play the game, as if you got a royal flush
But if you don't cool off, you just might get touched

I grind against the grain, and your brain like a crush
'Cause for me to get mine, is a plus and a must
But listen, hustling ain't for everybody
Especially if you ain't got the heart, and you's a scary body

Oh but I know, you don't hear me boy
It's goin' take something bad to happen, for you to feel me boy
But I'm so sick and tired, of teaching and preaching
You ain't even meet me half way, it's like I'm the only one that's reaching

While you keep leaching, you goin' find yourself smashed
Pumped up, wrecked and crashed
You must of forgot my nigger, your future's my past
You oughtta listen, 'fore you wind up on your ass

[Chorus: x2]

On how, I got this cash
I sold zones bled mics, moved rocks and hash
I click pro long, had to get on these blocks and mash
You want your do' long, try to hit these blocks and mash

Be careful though, you got niggers that watch your stash
And the second you slip get off his hip, goin' pop your ass
Get a connect cop a Tech, take your prize in the dash
We balling now, hit the lot put your ride on glass

You hard headed not heated, when you ride on glass
Left it at home, but you need it when you ride on glass
Knocked off your feet you looking weak, your boys slide on past
Had a high class bitch, now you collide with trash

Now you the hood rat plumber, pushing hood rat lil' mama
Laid up with the slut, and caught the high five from her

You know how I act in the Lac, I'm a hog
T.V.'s back in the back, got to fall
Texas boys crawl, like a nigga with his legs cut
K bullets hit niggas, and they edge up
Pay attention, focus nigga
Third, Fourth and Fifth Ward rogus nigga
4-4, Southwest vaulters nigga
Better have that on your mind, when you approach us nigga
A bitch'll jump fly, when they dose your hitter

Cocaine disector, come with Hannibal Lector
Tell the visual projector, when I'm watching a flick
I reckon need to had your chick, cause I got paper to get
Hundred miles per hour, slowing down my viders
Stampede the stateline, flood the booth with powder
I'm balling nigga, three hundred-sixty degrees
In the streets shedding cheese, you better recognize g's
Hollow T-I-P's, choppers and barettas
Fucking with my cheddar, I wet up niggas sweaters
Young in the game, crunching on niggas like ab work
And I'ma chase my paper stacks, till my calves hurt
Feel that, take it from a real cat
Or be a fool run up, and get your wig peeled back

With a appetite like Hannibal, bitch I'm flammable
I'm bout to lock it up, beneath the key
S-E-N-S-E-I, that's me
Get ready for three minutes, of constant head rushing
Crushing mice, it's a verbal head busting
I'm a mic ripper, plus a motherfucking bike flipper

Watchin' the OG's in the hood while they flossin' in they rides
Candy paint, chrome wheels, and black magic on the attire
Me, yeah I was lovin' it, but not old enough drive
Parkin' lot pimpin' from the passenger side
I use to walk everywhere I had to show up
Shoe hills, one down like wheel rubber, man I was about to go nuts
Hopefully I would blow up in these rap game man
My people roll swanga's, I wanted to be rollin' the same thang
Never had alot of work, but I was doin' what I could
Movin' nickles, dimes, twenty's, and ounces all threw my hood
Since I had a one yolla fines cash me up
Mean while thumpin' for a ride my homies pass me up
It's all gravy, when I'm able I'm a showin' all somthin'
From a hopte to a foreign, I'm ballin' it's all or nothin'
Treat my feet with' designer to fine sneak's when I leave my home
Only place you catch me walkin' is to my mail box's
Cause on the streets I be on crome

I'll keep rollin' chrome
I'll keep rollin' chrome
Wood grain is what I'm holdin' on
I'll keep rollin' chrome

Huh, I started off with' a canary yellow cutlass supreme on bald tire's
Yeah I know I was out of line
But that was all I could find
Or should I say that was all I could purchase for what I had to spend
But at least I had somthin' to go from point A to B and
No more offerin' gas money to get a lift
Besides when your driven it's easyer to get a chick
So ani't no more parkin' lot pimpin' at the club I'm up in there
Seekin' little mama, with' thick thighs, I hope she let me in there
Like swim wear, pull up to the motel, and we'll go in there
Nothin' left to do but comit a sin there
And that was in my hopte, but when I show up in my big body with' the gloss
All of the boppers was boppin' I just could'nt shake'm off
Sixteen switches, tewnty-two inches, trunk goin' to war
They don't want to lay here with me, they want to lay in my car
I was lovin' it back then and still love it today
Except I'm not yellow cutlase no more, I'm 300 blue over gray, on chrome

I'll keep rollin' chrome
I'll keep rollin' chrome
Wood grain is what I'm holdin' on
I'll keep rolin chrome

Finally I'm in the mix, ridin' twenty four's or twenty six
My neck and my wrist lite, with' out me sellin' a brick
Tv's in the roof and the dashboard and I'm watchin' a flick
Rollin' with my pistol in my lap and I'm cockin' if
I spy somethin' suspicious in my rear view mirror when I'm creepin'
If you plan on jackin' me I plan on leavin' you sleepin'
I be in different vehicle cause I'm havin' thangs
King of the ghetto entertainment got me havin' change
You can smell it on me, even tho quite, the way I live it be tellin' on me
Don't get twisted I'm still a felon homie
Thinkin' you goin' to rob me that's a N O
And when I'm in N O I roll with god and as always Mr.Marsello
And they be with me when they in Texas don't par take it as a spy
Harlum nights in stores where they drop it like it's hot
So if your tryin' to call me and I don't answer my phone
I can't hear it cause my music to loud I'm bangin' on chrome

I'll keep rollin' chrome (rollin chrome)
I'll keep rollin' chrome (rollin chrome)

There's way more fakers out here, than you thought 'cause
They can't help themselves, from being those lost duds
I'm high, buzzing off blueberry frost buds
Cause that's the way I collect, and gather my thoughts up
And I know, you all think I signed with the Boss but
I collabed with him again, just to get me some boss bucks
If you don't like me, you don't got to
'Cause you're not me, and I am not you
Half the shit you industry, I promise you this
It's not you expect for you stop it, in a drop that's blue
Now what you got to do, it's better than that
The way they bragging, I thought you was better than that
Keep bumping, I'ma put that lead in the gat
Cock it back and watch the buck shots, spread in your hat
Then your bitch ass, be dead as a mat
Laying there staying, ain't nothing deader than that

Ain't what you thought you saw
You're better off, not looking at all

When we pull up we back to back, in European cars

Chris Webby,"I’m a walking bad habit, E tabs up in the cabinet
Savage rap status: vocabulary extravagant
A rock star poppin’ rotches in bars
Used to flip bud now just rappin’ cop me a car
No tellin’, Connecticut felon, I GPS ‘em
And find my mark like Magellan with more lines than Corey Feldman
I never cease to impress ‘em
I cardiac arrest ‘em
With every studio session I'm killin' ‘em, no question
Webb’s back, better hold your breath when I’m rhyming homes
I murder beats, I’m Jonah Hex on the microphone
Fiends saying I’m the dopest yet
And haters? I shrug ‘em off until my fucking shoulders sweat
I’m breaking bones, a modern version of Casey Jones
Scored a hand, I’m the winner playing the Game of Thrones
Fuck beef, my rapping style’s filet mignon
Gettin’ drunk, fuck yo’ driver, somebody take me home

(Take me home)
Take me home now bitch

I know that I should change, but I don’t really think I can
It’s just part of my nature – I never cracked, I never ran
The world was falling on me when my back was in a jam
I always kept on fighting, that’s exactly who I am
And this is who I am, no way that I can change it
I’m buckwild, stupid, and dangerous
My best friends are not strangers
These are the motherfuckers I hang with
We speak the same language
And I ain’t saying French, English, or Spanish, or Spanglish
I mean pain and anguish, this cocaine slangin’ bang-bang shit
MAC-11s that we aim with
In other words, I’m rolling with the same clique I came with
I’m the sameness and fuck being famous
Fame dreams are for groupies
I’m a real-life gangster that you ain’t seen in the movies
What I mean is I’m truly off the hook
Like a phone in a nursing home, homie I’m that Boston crook

I damage tracks, so listeners always ran it back
Always with a half-ounce stuffed into a sandwich bag
I kill it quickly and always keeping the realest with me
Stealing all the fucking insulin from Wilford Brimley
“Diabetes,” rappers could never beat us
I been spittin’ shit like this since I was just a fuckin’ fetus
Keep your chick with me as long as she give dome
Rollin’ up the Diesel, I’m burning like Jim Rome
Bitch!

Yeah, standin’ here’s a man with the past, the inspiration
For the kids on the corner, but still got the laugh of a mental patient
The infiltration of the game
Born from a central hatred of fame
A pencil shaking with pain
An injured stake in the claim from the wrath I became
My paragaphs’ insane: they're futuristic pictures of the past from which I came
And this is Slaine with a shotty in the hooptie son
My whole career’s a robbery that they could never scoop me from

And my fans be getting them tickets quicker than pissing in public in Times Square
That nightmare on your street, stay with the hash like corned beef
And I light it up and I breathe it and my blunt be full of that four leaf
We killing this and I'm on my grind, running shit I got sore feet
24 deep on my tour bus, rolling right out to the floor seats
I'm blowing up what are you doing, sitting at home and YouTubing
Hating on me from a laptop, but these type of people I'm used to em
You ain't doing shit but smoking weed, watching porn, got no degree
You're a disappointment and blame everybody else that you never got where you hoped to be
See I worked for it, you sat back, I grinded out while you relaxed
And now you like; ""Fuck Webby man, yo, I should be where he's at, wait is that him, did he just cut the line, wait where's Denise at?""

Drinking this gin they be calling me Qui-Gon
Started out in that small time, mixtapes in the trunk of the car that I was driving in
That Altima, with back bumper hanging off the side, people honking at me (get off the road!)
Getting pulled over so often I'd have my registration at all times, 
Hanging out my window like
Sorry guy, I know I was speeding, I'm fucking high, 
But my plates are good and I'm fucking dry
Smoked all my weed on my way down here, we ain't got no charges? Fuck you, bye
Peel off in that shit box, so kick rocks, I'm out of here
Then head back to my parents house and get drunk until I run out of beer
But that was then, now I'm living differently
The clubs that would always turn me away, now they all let me in for free
The girls that used to blow me off, now they all on their friggin' knees
Still blowing me off, only difference? Now it's literally

Damn right, sloppy sloppy drunk
And we came to get down right
Damn right, green up in my blunt

Chris Webby,"[Chorus]
I be living in the left lane
Passing y'all by
Sun roof rolling back, speakers up high
I be living in the left lane
Closing my eyes, watch the world from the third person inside
I be living in the left lane
Never looking back with my foot up on the gas, ain't got no time to react
I be living in the left lane
Moving too fast, I'm just trying not to crash, it could all end in a flash
When you be living in the left lane

Fast money, fast women, fast cars, doing donuts in the back-yard
Middle fingers up like a rap star, telling me I go too hard
Shots all lined up on the God damn bar, with a chick so bad she dropping jaws
And I'm dropping trou and I hit that raw, yeah
Live this way till I lose my mind, me I'm doing fine
Fucking monster call me Frankenstein and Dracula combined
On my grind, in my verbal prime, still Optimus Rhyme
Got Griselda Blanco coke and no one fucking with these lines
'Cause uh, all this shit is apart of my job, the parties the woman
The liquor the music, living a life you could only imagine
Put it in words and I give it to you, kids
But I told them, please don't try this at home, you really will lose it
So don't blame me if my listeners do it (let's go)

I be living in the left lane
Moving too fast, I'm just trying not to crash, it could all end in a flash
When you be living in the left lane

Let me carefully win, they callin' me Jeremy Lin, never stare at the rim
If you going to give me the rock I'm gonna dribble and carry it in, no comparing to him
Up on the road everyday, chugging a bottle of gin, contacts lens, 20/20
But you can't see them from under my brim, do it again ('gain)
Beast mode, Kung-fu, trees rolled, shit I'm here to rap
And if you're not I'd check that ego, try to keep it peaceful
But if they be coming at me bro
I'm rolling up in a tank, like I got Grand Theft Auto cheat codes
A mix of Mick Jagger and Morrison on tour again, pushing the fucking limits till I'm in the crematorium
'Cause when a star goes out it does so in a blaze of glory, then Mr. Harry Fraud will just bring the chorus in

Chris Webby,"I got the game on lockdown, ridin' with the top down, and I'm feeling so good
Baby we'll be headed to the top now cause it's the only way to go

Yeah, I'm on a roll now, traveling all around the globe
Only my booking agent know where I'm about to go
With a pretty young thing and an ounce to roll
Live that rockstar life call me Aldous Snow, uh
Feeling great, filet mignon on my plate
But I'm always staying hungry, you can see it on my face
You can see it in my eyes, I'mma win this race
Pulling through the finish line, like Brink on skates
And I'm feeling spectacular, still an eligible bachelor
It's so lovely, french kissing models with some molly on my tongue
In a different city every night like I was on the run
We gone, we gone, shout to everyone who supports me
Legal troubles over with, no more going to court, B
Now I'm chilling with a Vicky and a Courtney, top down, warp speed

I always told them ""I will never stop"" now, look at what I got now
Always knew that I would, baby, and we headed to the top now
'Cause it-it's the only way to go
Now I got the game on lock-down, riding with the top down
And I'm feeling so good, baby, and we headed to the top now
'Cause it-it's the only way to go

I been out to sea, had to send an SOS
But I made it back to shore and I'm next on deck
Always got a little sexy brunette on text
Saying ""I'll see you when you back in town xox""
I've been slept on like futons, looked over like typos
Now you see my fucking name up in the lights, yo
Always been the under dog call me Fido
But I know, and always knew that I would win the fight bro
Either that or I'm going to go down swinging
Never back down if we gotta throw down, bring it
But still we having fun, strip club, pile of ones
And act a jackass, R.I.P Ryan Dunn
Shout to Sap always killing a track
We just some kids making money, what's the matter with that
And until I get a Grammy I'll be doing just dandy
The black sheep's now the bread winner of the family

And I'm feeling so good, baby, and we headed to the top now
'Cause it-it's the only way to go

Way to go, way to go, it's the only way to go
Way to go, way to go, it's the only way to go
Way to go, way to go, it's the only way to go
Way to go, way to go, it's the only way to go

I only think about it when I'm looking back
To the kid I used to be writing lyrics during class
Back when I had nothing but ambition and a dream
And a composition notebook full of rhyme schemes
I mean, I was a fuck up, but then I grew the fuck up
And gave it everything while I was working on my come up
And now I came up and baby I won't stop till I'm done
So now I'm yelling at the top of my lungs (Let's go!)

[Chorus]
I always told them ""I will never stop"" now, look at what I got now
Always knew that I would, baby, and we headed to the top now

Now I got the game on lock-down, riding with the top down
And I'm feeling so good, baby, and we headed to the top now
'Cause it-it's the only way to go

Way to go, way to go, it's the only way to go
Way to go, way to go, it's the only way to go
Way to go, way to go, it's the only way to go
Way to go, way to go, it's the only way to go

Yeah, I'm feeling good right now, man
All these years of hard work are finally paying off
There's really only one direction to go now
And that's up, so ya'll coming with me or what",Only Way to Go,2013

Started off small, now I do it for the masses
It's that evil rap, evil rap, rap rap nemesis, putting together sentence

It's that evil rap nemesis second coming of Hendrix
Breaking laws, flipping off Officer Friendly, bitch
I'm a Jedi in the booth, with the power of phantom menaces
Light saber swinging, chopping off your appendages
Generously applying the dopest of rhyming
Open your eyes and see the headlights running over you driving
Over and over and over it on the road that I'm riding
You better open your mind or I'll do it for you (alright)
I'm just a mother fucking psychotic, neurotic, embodiment
Of everything your parents told you not to be probably
Taking shots out the bottle and now Alcoholics Anonymous
Smoking White Rhinoceros with Zach Galifinakis
Dropping hits of acid while rapping that's multi-tasking a lot of shit
Practicing karate kicks on people back in the audience
Popping Klonopin, obviously, shots'll be honestly
You, pull me out the party, I'm the shit ain't no stopping me dude

And you mother fuckers better get the cameras ready for action

Shit is bound to cause a deadly reaction
Step to Webby motherfucker you gonna see how unfair feels, repping Fairfield to Norwalk
So damn, real, and you know I stay with the trees like Bear Grylls
Jimmy Hoffa the fucking beat and leave them in landfills
I just stand still, back in the building, spit this shit so cold
You can feel it in your cavity filling
I'm just trying to get some money till it stack to the ceiling
With all these motherfucking tracks that I'm killing
Well you know I got my Super Mario star, I'm untouchable
Fucking Clair Huxtable making her put an oven full of brownies with the hash oil
Then we cook them up until I toss them in my tummy and my brain is dysfunctional

Chris Webby,"See now my cup is full, my vibe is boosted
My fate is undecided, but it's going down the way that I choose it
Living life up on the stage and it's like I'm on display
And the fans coming through when they know every word to the songs that I fucking play
Bang the speakers out plus tears are leaking out
Girls in the crowd are freaking out, labels reaching out
Buzz is peaking out, when I'm doing everything I dreamed about
Man, I think I'm on one, saw the easy route, took the long one
And now they ain't ready for this crazy white boy
Running through the rap game like Donkey Kong
'Cause I be super smashing them I'm back with a rap attack
I'm homegrown and I grew the roots and it's about damn time that I flew the coop
So mother fucker let me show you what this dude could do
Going through the roof and I'm gonna hold my own
CT down to the bones, so anywhere I'm going you know I'm coming back
Because as they say, ain't no place like home so then I'm gone

Ride on...yeah
Baby, where you wanna go
Got my foot up on the pedal till the sun goes down
I just hop up in the driver's seat and
Ride on...yeah
Baby, where you wanna go
We be riding, we be riding
We be riding, yeah we be riding on

I'm here to do my thang, so what you really know about that shit
Good kid in a fucked up game, suitcase still packed from the last trip
Like this and I feel alright, turned around my life
Started from the bottom, now I'm in the middle
Sitting first class on a flight and I still got fight
As long as I got a mic I'll recite the type of hype shit that'll spark ignite
And set the world on fire when I give it a light
You never heard of one like this in your life because I go so hard
Got these bars on me, baby, I'm a super star and the bass go roar
Like I got Simba trapped in the trunk of my car
R-R-Roger that the rhyme is [?], stepping on the gas pedal when I ride[write?] a track
Real shit, anybody that deny the facts, fuck you, ain't nobody got time for that
Ain't nobody got time for that shit, the same kid crashing Datpiff
Is back to the smack the world off it's axis
I'm in the game now, you better go home and practice
Firework in the sky bitch, get so high, fuck around and hit a pilot
I'm just feeling like it really is my time, this rhyme shit ain't for the weak
Don't try this, at home if you ain't ready for the life, this game [?] whether or not you like it
So I'm telling you all the ups and downs so you can see the world I'm in, 
Looking through my eyelids

We be riding, yeah we be riding on

Came close to being [?][I could of made it?]
Frustrated with the industry, how can I motivate it
Feeling like the only loser that my parents pro-created
Watching homies that associated with me [?][Know I waited for my turn?]
[?] It was so belated, I was jaded, when I made it, it was hard to believe
Even harder for me not to wear my heart on my sleeve
But, people judging me in the public
And I started to read, the comments underneath my video, my skin is thick enough
It's hard to describe the feeling when somebody telling me that my music got them through when they were feeling like giving up
He standing right in front of me and [?]
Cause he enough with his girlfriend and they breaking up
He breaking up, playing my music it helps to lighten the blow
Player wishing to sleeping like 20 times in a row
Mouthing the lyrics when they hear it getting hype at the show, I love it
Ain't got no money, but I'm getting through
Gotta remind my self, time to time when I get in a depressing mood
I'm getting paid first[?]
[?]
Look at my dressing room
1,000 miles away they want an autograph
He said he like my deep records and my party tracks
I scribble things across the bottom half

Chris Webby,"It’s Chris Webby, getting high as fuck right now
I’m hella sick, and no one knows what I’m infected with
So hi it’s nice to meet you
I’m the guy your girl been texting with
Evil rap nemesis, lighting up that heady shit
That’s potent as the poison in a fucking box jellyfish
In a box Chevy with the soldiers in my fellowship
Legolas and Aragorn cruising through Connecticut
Leave behind a trail of empty bottles and jealous chicks
Throw around bread, I’m on my Hansel and Gretel shit
A psychopath on a path of destruction
Popping Xanax til I’m seeing black
I better pass the Dutch Master I’m puffing
The first up the the mic but the last to the function
Stumbling drunk with a busty chick with a passion for sucking
East Coast, we don’t borrow your swagger for nothing
We’d rather start a battle instead of having a discussion
So pass it back to me, cousin
Shit I’m so nice I could spit this shit right here backwards in Russian!

No sound like the one I got
They can hear it anytime I rock
Cause all I got’s my balls and my word
And this baggie full of herb
And I’m coming for that #1 spot

I’ve always been a loose cannon
They say I rolled off of a pirate ship
High as shit, Bobby Costas, look how red my eyes’ll get
I’m out in Sochi, 720 to a flying split
And land all up in that vagina bitch, huh
See I be showing them what I can do with this shit

Thought that I wanted it so I just shot for the sky
Now I don’t even know why
Gave it a try, wanted a piece of the pie, now it’s a fucking surprise
The way that I’m living is different
I’m hitting and missing, and I’m just here trying to vibe
Oh my god, all this shit done changed, people be noticing me
Now they all love me, or hate me
Like there ain’t no in between
I’m doing me, and that’s all I know
Out on the road doing these shows
To give you the fans a little piece of my soul
But you must know I’m just like you when I ain’t got no mic
So if you see me out in public show me respect and we aight
And yes you can have an autograph
But if I’m with a girl or my family and friends
I don’t get that much so please don’t ask
Pick and choose, you respect me as a person, I’ll reciprocate
Tip my hat and give you dap and I will just be on my way
If you see me while I’m out and got my hat down to my eyes
Brim low, that is like my “please do not disturb” sign

I’m just tryna live my life like I’m supposed to be
While I’m following the path that has chosen me
Now it’s everywhere I go people notice me
Feet planted with my head up high
But I’ma keep my brim low, and I don’t see no haters
My eyes red, cause I’m always medicated
Now they say I made it, cause I’m elevated
But my feet planted and my head up high
But I’ma keep my brim low
I’ma keep my brim low, I’ma keep my brim low
I’ma keep my brim low with my head up high
And I’ma keep my brim low

Always be keeping my hat to my brow
And my head in the clouds
Shit has been stressing me so I been rolling this loud
Trying to block it all out
But I know right now that this here’s my shot
Shit or get off of the pot
Shoot for the top, ain’t no looking back
This is all I got, so I will not stop
But I sacrifice my private life
That’s the shit that drives a person nuts
But I won’t lose sight of that feeling I got way back when
When I started to write
Hit Radio Shack with my dad
Bought me a mic, best day of my life
Ever since then I just make this music
Put it out for them to hate
But I’m Superman, my skin too thick to be penetrated
So many people always been telling me that I never would make it
But I’m an artist, how many times must I demonstrate it?
Now it’s my time to take it, I made my choices
But now so many people in my ear I’m hearing voices
So if you see me while I’m out and got my hat down to my eyes
Brim low, that is like my “please do not disturb” sign

I’m just tryna live my life like I’m supposed to be

Unless I take those 12 steps, aimed at gettin sober
That's the shit I told myself I'll handle when I'm older
And now I'm older and still got this devil on my shoulder
Bottle up my problems, like prescriptions I'm poppin
All the liquor that I find myself drinkin so often
Now these cards are dealt, told myself I don't need help
Numb myself to everything, and keep on runnin from myself

Let's drink away the pain
Let's make another toast
Let's smoke another blunt
Until it's just a roach
And pop another pill
And drop another dose

Left here to battle this addictive personality
That's got me living in this alternate reality
Losing touch before this [?] so gradually
Cause at this point I need these chemicals to balance me
It's like I'm following a blueprint that the devil made
Since I first took my Ritalin in the 7th grade
The doctor gave me 16 milligrams, just a kid
Barely weighed a buck, it's like they used me as their guinea pig
Crazy teen, medicated ADD
Doctor said take only 1, but you know I was taking 3
Blazin tree and skippin class, getting drunk and missin math
Bangin chicks without a rubber, crushin pills up on the desk
Chemically imbalanced in this motherfucker, startin shit
Still I was a smart kid, got myself a scholarship
Private schools with it, button-downs with the dockers
And the JanSport full of weed stuffed into my locker

Let's make another toast
Let's smoke another blunt
Until it's just a roach

See I'm just wreckin out weekly, livin on repeat
Still in highschool but the teachers could never reach me
Always was the fuck up with a chip on my shoulder
And a pocket full of anything to keep me from sober
See I was livin like there's no tomorrow
Chewin on a xany bar, rollin up the window smokin blunts up in family car
Bottles to the head, got detention on the reg
Never listenin to what my parents said
I was always rollin with an ounce or two
Everytime I'm bouncin through
Flippin everybody off like Shady taught me how to do
Always thinkin that the more we burnin, the merrier
Just a kid from middle-class suburban America
And so many others like me, listen to me nightly
Happy that somebody else is feelin' what they might be
So Christian pop a pill, oh yeah I bet you will
'Cause if that shit don't make your problems any less forreal

Things that keep you up awake through the night
Praying that the moves I’m making are right
Tryna find myself a way through the fight

Came up in the game just a youngin with a mean flow
Here to rock until the clock hits zero
Feel like I’m seeing the world through a peep hole
Stressed out, what you think I’m smoking weed for?
Gotta put one in the air like a free throw, or a G4
All these people doubting me and judging me without knowing me
So what you mean though?
Living life, what you hating on me for?
Oh you mad after finally getting mine
All these years on the grind I’m dropping shit
And now I’m getting shine, breaking records online
But every single one of my accomplishments
Comes at a cost, losing my mind
Always faded off of that pot prescript
Can’t slip up, I don’t got time

But they don’t see the negatives
On tour at least half of the year
Missing holidays and hardly seeing my relatives
They don’t know about the stress of the game
Everyday damn day, shit it got me popping sedatives
Like they fucking jelly beans, will I ever see the end of this?
If I do, shit, will I even remember it?
I don’t know man, all this rapping shit
Got me second guessing everything I had convinced
At the end of the day, fuck it I asked for this
I wouldn’t take it back for shit
I’ma soldier, with a good head on my shoulders
In it til I win it or I get a game over
Feeling like I’m on a roller coaster
Friends turn to foes and my heart grows colder
Drawn to the game like a moth to the flame
Sacrifice it all for the fame
But it’s all worth it when you up on stage and they calling your name
No doubt I’ll be paying the price in the end
But I’m cool now taking a right down the road untraveled
Seatbelt strapped in, this is just another day in the life

And I’m feeling like I’m losing my mind
This game will lock you up for certain
But I’m doing my time
I keep a smile on my face, I keep my head to the sky

So my fans will get their fix every time they bumpin' my music

Let me get that dopamine, baby give me that dopamine
If you wanna feel it too, then all you gotta do is roll with me
And everything is how it's suppose to be
And that's the shit that I'm on, that's the shit that I want
Wither I get it from hittin' pussy or rippin' a bong
I'm just tryna' get my fix
Let me get that dopamine, baby give me that dopamine

That bamma weed you smokin', ain't fuckin' with the OG
I hit it till I'm coughing, I hit it often
I'm like a Power Ranger the way I'm mighty morphing
Into a rocket ship, that's taking off into space as I get lost
Thanks to stimulating endorphins, brings me closer to the coffin
Walk on the edge, cuz' I'm on the ledge
Wake up, when they go to bed
Got these cowards runnin' a bounty hunter like a Boba Fett
Life is like a drug, born addicted like crack babies
Tryin' ta' get that fix, you gonna hurt your back, like the Bag Lady
Goodbye dude, I expose these niggas', I got to
These niggas' heads bigger than yakoo, it's not cool
Lyrical mournings, gettin' us gory as biblical stories, you ignoren' the allegories
Tryin' to feel good; it's Aleister Crowley
Rush of that adrenaline is my medicine
My fuel is my kerosene
You ever live the life of a heretic?
That, dopamine, from the smoke the coke the lean
Is temporary when your third eye ain't opening

I'm just tryna' get my fix

Bitch on my lap, gyratin'
Loud so loud, my lungs vibratin'
High as a bitch I'm up skyscappin'
Annihilatin' some kind of [?]
That's the feelin' I feel when I am creatin'
And the fire's escapin', though your fire escape em'
Until I lie in your basement
Arise in the pavement just to arrive from inside of a spaceship
That fix, I'm suppose to dream
I chase Hennessey with dopamine
This is dope, I mean, I ain't sober
Promethazine in my soda, I'm suppose ta lean
My momma cookin'? Encore
The family members I die for
The two beautiful kids I stay alive for
Plus Hip-Hop makes me feel alive more
That fix

Let me get that dopamine, baby give me that dopamine
If you wanna feel it too, then all you gotta do is roll with me

Wither I get it from hittin' pussy or rippin' a bong
I'm just tryna' get my fix
Let me get that dopamine, baby give me that dopamine

Let me put you down, with some realness
You feelin' loud with me and Webby, rockin on that trill shit
Feelin' bliss, like its that fattest joint you ever hit
Higher than you've ever been, of course you know you're feelin' this
With that fellin' that you get when you open up your
Bag of weed waiting for the first hit anxiously
With the rush; when the Lakers beat the Celtics
The smile on your face when the joint lit, and ya smelt it
We the vibe at the party, when that shits about to turn up
We the ""hell ya"", ya thinkin' when the dabs about to burn up
The fist pump, bitch I'm number one, I'm the winna' by the
Toast at the table when we celebrate our [?]
Roar of the crowd when ya see something amazing
Where the thrill of victory, with the felling of elation
It's a presentation and we hope you see
You're in need of that dopamine

I'm just tryna' get my fix

Yeah, Truth spit game, murda'
Shoulda' been cased on it
Causing panic, now the living shoes laced on it
Haters on dick, look like they want to face on it
Money, long slates, givin' a open chase on it
I'm fully sober, my fix is chicks and change
And ride, n' lookin' amazing, n' something so strange
I hit the hood, just to kick it with homies
No, they need it for support, everyone that promote it
I best to dodge the phoney, cuz' I don't understand them
And I ain't tryn'
I'm the truth and I don't fuck with that [mind?], stay from [?]
Hit the studio to blackout, maybe try gettin' packed out
Just like somebody wanted this as soon as I blow it back out
I might just give a laugh as I proceed to knock a track out
And burned up the speakers in trunk tryna' act out
Say [?] [?] [?], I'm on my turn up
Get [tightest?] in them [?], [?] me a drink, you bout to turn up

Let me get that dopamine, baby give me that dopamine
If you wanna feel it too, then all you gotta do is roll with me
And everything is how it's suppose to be

Yo, it’s Chris Webby
At this party and shit, motherfucker wants me to rap
I’m about to open an abortion clinic right next to your local church
And go to narcotics anonymous hustling coke and percs
I’m just trying to piss you off, I really hope it works
Go berzerk, I got a dirty mouth, I’ll never hold a curse
Jerking off until my motherfucking shoulder hurts
Even if she vegan she gon swallow when my boner squirts
Help an older lady across the road, “hey can I hold your purse?”
Then kick her in front of a moving bus, “oh no, she’s hurt!”
Shit I’m pretty sure she’s dead but you can check yourself
While I run her wallet and spend all the money at Taco Bell
Anyone this deranged should surely be locked in jail
I’m on the grind but off the rails like an Eric Koston fail
I hit it rapid fire, try to pull out of a vaginal cavity
But busted while I was half inside her
Then I woke up in the morning and had a reminder
That she getting plan B for breakfast with an apple cider
Someone pass the lighter, I need some weed to breathe in
He’s a demon, dirty mind, sneaky heathen
I don’t need a reason
I’m creeping up like sex offenders with binoculars on a beach in bikini season
You won’t see me leaving, I’m running through that
Stomp you to death then throw my Nike’s back on the shoe rack
Huh I’ma do that, why bother tryna bleach the blood stains out?
Somebody told me orange is the new black
So I scrub my white T til it turns the color copper
And use some Tide detergent and throw it up in the washer
It’s weird that I ain’t crazy though, shit you can ask my doctor
Sike, I’m off my rocker like an active grandfather, motherfucker

Course I got the fuckin' CD man, fuckin' big meeting and shit
We're pretty late though, you think we're gonna be good?

No talking about Adderal, no talking about banging this guy's wife like.. (of course, of course) keep it real good
Oh shit, is that that fucking BarsTaLoan guy again?

I'm an untrained dog, no collar
Had loose screws since I was a toddler
Yo don't bother
Up in this bitch drinking vodka like water
Do you read me? Roger, I am a monster
All young buck white kids put the mic down, I am your father
Still be drinking like I did when I was up at Hofstra
Taking more shots than I did playing Contra
Hold up, hold up, hold up, wait
Let me take a sip of water, I don't know if I'm straight
Lost track of all the LIT's that I drank
And I'm feeling like I just might faint
But I lace my sneakers, eat a piece of pizza
And throw another [?] up on the Visa
Bangin' out those speakers
Going hard in the paint like I fucked Mona Lisa
Where the chronic B?
My short term memory is chronically
Fucked up, cause I burn down constantly
How could I shape up? I forgot geometry
But they gon' learn CT and geography
Cause I got the whole damn world watching me
It's hard to even keep up with it honestly
Let's gettin' it muthafuckin' poppin' B
Will lose some brain cells
I don't think I'm leaving this
Muthafucker, 'til someone takes away my keys and shit
I haven't been trained well, I'm so disobedient
Got that verbal dope, so just holla if you need a fix
Drop a freestyle, daily fire
Lighting up a bong up that'll take me higher
Crazy rhymer, that's known to cross the line like a stereotypical Asian driver
Web so sick that I make'em nauseous
Go balls out, never play it cautious
Went from a dorm room to rapping to muthafuckers in suits in a label office
I'm a beast on the mic with a beatbox flow
Anybody steppin' after he rocks, no
He got flow, I'm an animal, follow my name with an e-i, e-i, e-i-o

Nights like this started with a pre-game
Give me an auxiliary chord, now I'm the DJ
Playing what I wanna hear, none of the Pop shit
Give me the Big L, Wu Tang and Pac shit

Living on the border
There is no other option
Even if the memories we make are all forgotten

With a purple ounce, that motherfucker that you heard about
Spread around the internet because of word of mouth
Cannonballed off the deep end and swam further out
Tryna stack absurd amounts with a purdy spouse
Put one in the air like Super Smash pulling Kirby out
Jury’s out? Fuck it, I don’t care I’ma vent
And get fucking intense like Native American sex
Fuck the money, when I started I was there for respect
That’s why I’m still in Connecticut where my chariot rest
I’m on the edge, do y’all dare me to step?
Will y’all just find another rapper to rep and even care if I left?
Watched too many people run with my formula and get famous
Now all of em fucking famous and boy I’m just fucking waiting
Put my life up on the line for the glory that I’ve been chasing
Recording down in my basement, money poor but I was patient
Now I’m hustling and moving up, kid’s super tough
I ain’t popping? I tell em soon enough
I kept my circle tight, it never loosened up
And cut the snakes out like Medusa up at Super Cuts
It’s my job to get up on mics and say wild shit
Never once did I suggest that you should try it
Shut your trap, I’ma need a little silence
Let me do my job, is that alright bitch?

Hello, it’s so good to see you, it’s so nice to be back
Gather up ladies and gentlemen, just vibe to the track
Grab a seat, dim the lights while I’m reciting this rap
Best in the burbs, let's remind 'em why my title is that
It’s good to see you, it’s so nice to be back!

I remember being lost and hopeless in my parent’s attic
Feeling claustrophobic, but I never lost my focus
I’m back, hurting from a mix of mild scoliosis
And the weight of carrying the fucking state up on my shoulders
I’m on a marathon ahead of you, dude
They sucking wind, turning bluer than a jeopardy clue
The jealous ones developing resentment for the crew
Without knowing what I’ve been through
So come and step in these shoes
So what I didn’t sell crack and had a stabler home life?
Middle class white, they been hating my whole life
But they saw me grow up just like Raven Symone, right?
Scrawny little punk, to the Razor Ramon type
Independent and continually making fans
Turned down a lot of deals, and chose to make a stand
Fuck selling out, homie that ain’t the plan
Why push the envelope? I’m tackling the mail man
So here I am as I’m rambling, pants sagging
And ransacking the game, no receipt for the transaction
And they hopping right on to the band wagon
With this puff the magic dragon stuffed into a gram bag and
Attacking these beats thoroughly, in my prime currently
Only way to get me to shut my mouth is to murder me
Sure to be a legend, impressing with every story told
Go balls to the wall like I’m fucking y’all through a glory hole
My destiny is still an open book, just haven’t had my moment
I’m still underrated and overlooked
But fuck it yo I feel terrific
We’ve already made it further than anybody predicted

While I’m puffing on a magic dragon daily like it’s nothing
As I watch my competition and proceed to one-up em
And if they don’t like what I’m doing then, man, fuck em
And if they ain’t been down since jump I can’t trust em
Ever since my friend ratted on me and I ended up cuffed
In the back of an undercover whip
Cause my homie couldn’t help but run his lip
As soon as the fan was hit with some fucking shit
But that’s life and I’ve learned how to choose my friends better
Learned how to master my craft and be a trendsetter
Learned how to get knocked down
Learned how to get back up
I learned how to rock these crowds
Learned to accept that what’s...
...going on is a blessing beyond a logical fact
I don’t know if God is real but someone’s watching my back
Maybe it’s my boy Nick, we still miss you cuz
Next joint’s for you, now roll up

We all gonna die one day, so what?
But while I’m kicking I’ma have my middle fingers up
Yelling “fuck you”
Cause when life gets tough I shrug it off and keep it moving
Roll a doobie and puff
And we all got bills to pay, so what?
But while I’m in the green I’ll have my middle fingers up
Yelling “fuck you”
And when shit gets rough I’ll shrug it off and keep it moving
Roll a doobie and puff
I’ll roll a doobie and puff, I’ll roll a doobie and puff
Chilling, baking out my Chevy with my crew in the cut
I’ll roll a doobie and puff, I’ll roll a doobie and puff

Chris Webby,"Lately I've been contemplating
Watching humans tear apart this fucking planet
Like they've never heard of moderation
The people running things ain't worried bout no conservation
Unless there's money in the conversation
But what happens when the soil is too toxic for the plants to grow
And all our drinking water is polluted (got the answer bro?)
All I know is humans are the cancer of the planet
Forecast: lots of global warming with a chance of snow
Hoping things will change but I doubt they ever will
Mother nature dying while we yelling drill, baby drill
So in turn the world's heating up, climate change creeping up
Hell, at least those folks at Exxon made a decent buck
Carbon footprints on the world that'll never wash away
While the ones in charge of it ignoring what we got to say
Still we gotta try, all we got is you and I
Put your mother fucking fists in the sky, come and

Stand up, stand up, if you gonna fight for what you believe
Stand up, stand up, if you ain't falling for what they teaching
Stand up, stand up, if any time your back's up against the wall
Stand up, stand up, take away my freedom, you'll give me the reason to stand up!

I don't dabble much in things that are political
But it ain't hard to see
That half these politicians running shit are criminal
They way we written history is strictly fictitiously
Still they try tricking me, telling me that I'm living free
Now keeping quiet while they take away our freedoms
(Hell, they're just the constitutional laws, who fuckin' needs em?)
And the mainstream media decides what you'll be seeing
So I'm sceptical of everything, don't know what to believe in
'Cause they lying to us right under our noses
And we know it but there's nothing we can do to control it
And it's got me losing sleep
'Cause I'm seeing shit different than when I was younger
Watching world hunger while the economy's going under
Too caught up in reality shows and cell phones
Eatin' food full of GMO's to say
Yo! I've had enough of all these lies, all we got is you and I
Put your fucking fists up in the sky, come and

Stand up, stand up, if you gonna fight for what you believe
Stand up, stand up, if you ain't falling for what they teaching
Stand up, stand up, if any time your back's up against the wall
Stand up, stand up, take away my freedom, you'll give me the reason to stand up!

See now we've got these countries beefin' with us
Like some World War III shit
Things about to change, you'd be blind not to see this
Civil unrest, the greatest country in the west
Bout' to crumble like the Roman Empire, nonetheless
Our oceans full of plastic, and the air is full of chemicals
Well, we let it happen like it's consensual
But fuck that

To taste for to descend, to let me in
Maybe it's okay now if you turn and run away

Anesthetic days of crusades and consent, the idiot intent
And though our love was likely your disease is so competent
You're so proud of the few risks you've taken, child

Who'll rape and campaign until you resign
And I'd return your letter but I'm feeling unrefined

Chris Whitley,"from one island to another
wind shifting
currents cover the navigations
these separations
rowing home alone

a beach, a blazing fire
lighthouse eyes, nighttime desire

skips a stone

so what have I to give her
stars shine
waves whisper 
the constellations conversations 
one island to another",From One Island to Another,1998
Chris Whitley,"summer is lost now
the frost is closing in
to the cold gospel dollar 
the poor man walks in sin
I can't get no entrance
the doors all in rows
I pray into the distance
let me outta these heavy clothes

I beg
Indian summer I need some return
so hard to get warm now
and so easy to get burned
down on the pavement the laws are learned
it's so hard to get warm where 
it's so easy to get burned

when a sister called up
and said that love had broken down
I said there too much ice around here
to find no solid ground
well I just squeezed a season
from this paper bag
I pray to the burning tires
wrap my feet in rags

begging
Indian summer I need some return
it's so hard to get warm now
and so easy to get burned
down on the pavement the laws are learned
it's so hard to get warm where 
it's so easy to get burned

now the sky is empty
the street is sweating tears
communion at the station
for a million grinding gears
well I'm riding out this century
the harvest engines sing
from the church of mercenaries
to a naked virgin spring

I'm singing

all still, no word for where she'd been

To the things I learned so well in my youth,
I think I'm returning to
The days when I was young enough to know the truth

Now there are no games
To only pass the time
No more coloring books,
No Christmas bells to chime
But thinking young and growing older is no sin
And I can play the game of life to win

I can recall a time,
When I wasn't afraid to reach out to a friend
And now I think I've got
A lot more than a skipping rope to lift

Now there's more to do
Than watch my sailboat glide
Then everyday can be my magic carpet ride
And I can play hide and seek with my fears,
And live my life instead of counting my years

Let everyone debate the true reality,
I'd rather see the world the way it used to be
A little bit of freedom, all we're left
So catch me if you can

And more kisses than I could count

Before I got to the door

Aw naw, somebody just bought a
Shot of Patron, hang on
I just might have to stay
Aw naw, look at the time y'all
What happened to coats on, long gone…
I should be halfway home but aw naw

Yeah, girl I saw you come in
With all of your girlfriends
Just cuttin' up and shooting Bacardi
Yeah, I got my boys with me
But we're just blowin' off steam
Not lookin' to pick up anybody

So I was gonna walk on by
You turned around and we locked eyes

Aw naw, did you hear that song,
Oh the one that just came on
Come on, DJ, what you trying to do?
Aw naw, it would be so wrong
If we didn't dance one
Show off those jeans you painted on, aw naw, aw naw

No, I didn't mean to be here this long
I tried to leave so it ain't my fault.
No I didn't mean to be holding you
But tell me what was I supposed to do?

Chris Young,"When the sun comes up on a sleepy little town
Down around San Antone
And the folks are risin' for another day
'Round about their homes

The people of the town are strange
And they're proud of where they came
Well, you're talkin' 'bout china grove
Oh, China grove

Well, the preacher and the teacher
Lord, they're a caution
They are the talk of the town
When the gossip gets to flyin'
And they ain't lyin'
When the sun goes fallin' down

They say that the father's insane
And dear Missus Perkin's a game
We're talkin' 'bout the china grove
Oh, China grove

But every day there's a new thing comin'
The ways of an oriental view
The sheriff and his buddies
With their samurai swords
You can even hear the music at night

And though it's a part of the lone star state
People don't seem to care
They just keep on lookin' to the east

Talkin' 'bout the China grove

White table clothes and red wine,
We've been planning, this night,
Looking forward to it,for some time
Now honey I know you love getting dressed up,
And you know I love showing you off,
But watching your baby blue eyes, dancing in the candle light glow,
All I can think about, is getting you home,

[Chorus]
Walking through the front door, 
Seeing your black dress hit the floor, 
Uh honey there sure ain't nothing, like you loving
Me all night long, and all I can think about is getting you home,

I don't need this menu, no I don't,
I already know just what I want,
Did I hear you right, did you tell me,
Go pay the waiter and lets leave, 
Now honey I know by that look in your eyes,
And your hand drawing hearts on mine, 
That our night out of the house, ain't gonna last too long, 
When all you can think about, is getting me home,

You say it ain't the same
Spends all his time playing your heart like it's just a game
He should've never let you go
Now I got a real good reason
To let you know I wanna hold you close and pick up the pieces

You don't have to be alone tonight
Why you sitting at home tonight
Waiting for him to call you up at midnight, drunk
To tell you that he wants you
Let's get out of town tonight
Get lost and found tonight
'Til you don't care let me love you right
Let's go somewhere where you and I
Can be all alone tonight

I wanna see your face
And whisper in your ear
I'm gonna say all the little things

Chris Young,"Like a desert calls the rain on the hottest driest day
And when those storm clouds hit it comes alive
Like a guitar calls for strings, without 'em it can't sing
About that girl, she's my world, the one thing on my mind

Is that riding down the road, her shotgun with me
Those come-to-bed eyes when she's had too many
That way she don't have to say a thing
She's callin' my name
That wink when her dress starts falling
The way she's gotten my heart wrapped up all in one look
She don't even say a thing
And she's callin' my name

Like a jukebox calls for change so it can pick a love song to play
Just like last call calls for one more drink

Is that riding down the road, her shotgun with me
Those come-to-bed eyes when she's had too many
That way she don't have to say a thing
She's callin' my name
That wink when her dress starts falling
The way she's gotten my heart wrapped up all in one look
She don't even say a thing
She's callin' my name, callin' my name

Her kiss, her touch says please stay longer
Every day her love gets stronger
She's callin' my name
With every glance it just gets louder
I can't help but think about her
She's callin' my name

Is that riding down the road, her shotgun with me
Those come-to-bed eyes when she's had too many
That way she don't have to say a thing

The way my name rolls off your tongue
The way the light it hits your eyes
And makes me come alive
It moves me more than any song
When you've got that shade of lipstick on
Across the room or by my side

Baby I can feel my heartbeat, heartbeat
Pounding my chest, you in that dress
Making it jump like a kick drum on repeat
I love the way you make my heart beat, heartbeat
There's no mistaking right now it's racing
Every time that you get close to me
Baby I can feel my heartbeat

You make me feel like I could fly
Like some old roller coaster ride
The way you flip your hair
Well girl it gets me every time
You drive me that perfect kind of crazy

Baby I can feel my heartbeat, heartbeat
Pounding my chest, you in that dress
Making it jump like a kick drum on repeat
I love the way you make my heart beat, heartbeat
There's no mistaking right now it's racing
Every time that you get close to me
Baby I can feel my heartbeat

In the middle of the floor we're swaying
And your favorite song is playing
Girl I'm just saying
I can feel your heartbeat, heartbeat
Pounding your chest, there in that dress
Making it jump like a kick drum on repeat
I love the way you make my heart beat, heartbeat
There's no mistaking right now it's racing

Hair free in the breeze getting all unwound
Jump in the water go weekend wild
Get wrapped up in an old beach towel
Break out tequila salt and the lime

Flip flops and tank tops, and tan lines
Makes you wanna grab the sun tan lotion

Same drinks that we're all raising

We used to be the life of the party
We used to be the ones that they wished they were
But now it's like they don't know how to act
