Full Force,"You're always on my mind, (day and night) day and night
When I think of you boy, everything feels so right
Well I often think of the happy times we spent together
And I just can't wait to tell you that I love you
Time keeps passing by, (you're not here) you're not here
I feel so all alone when I don't have you near
But I often think of the happy times we spent together
And I just can't wait (just can't wait) to tell you that I love you
I'm missing my baby, (missing my baby) missing my baby
I gotta hold you tight, and never let you out of my sight
Missing my baby, (missing my baby) missing my baby
I gotta feel your heart beat (your heart beat) next to mine
Gotta feel it
Time keeps passing by, (you're not here) you're not here
I feel so all alone when I don't have you near
Well I often think of the happy times we spent together
And I just can't wait (just can't wait) to tell you that I love you
I'm missing my baby, (missing my baby) missing my baby
I gotta hold you tight, and never let you out of my sight
Missing my baby, (missing my baby) missing my baby
I gotta feel your heart beat next to mine
Sometimes at night when I go to sleep
I hold my pillow tight,
thinking of you 'til is hurts
But in my mind, I know you're mine
And somewhere you're thinking of me too
Gotta have you (have you), gotta hold you (hold you)
Got to have your lovin' (I gotta have you)
And tell you that I love you
And I really miss you (I miss you)...",Missing My Baby,1995
Full Force,"Hello, it's me again
Don't you know it's hard to keep a good woman down
But then again, maybe that could be fun

Sa-Sa-Sa-Sa-Samantha Fox!

Ain't it funny how, when I say let's go out
You're always saying someone else will get me
What's a girl to do - I like to have fun too
But you're so jealous - you never let me

So how come you can leave - but when it comes to me
Always something I must prove  (To you)
You know I love you - always thinking of you
But tonight - I've got to make that move

I want to have some fun
Move my body all night long
I want to have some fun
Move my body all night long

What your momma used to say - All work - No play
I know what to do - I think I'll call my crew
Of course, I love you - but naughty girls need fun too

Could it be that I make you feel guilty why
Is there something I can't see - (NO)
I just don't buy it - so don't even try it
I've got to go in the place to be

I want to have some fun
Move my body all night long
Working hard every day
So I ain't staying home no way

I need it  (I need it)
I want it  (I want it)
Got to   (Got to)
Flaunt it  (Flaunt it)

I'm not a prisoner - can't you see
Unlock the door so I can breathe
Whenever it comes to you my dear
I say stay with me but you still go
So now I learn
It's my turn

I want you to stay here with me
You can have fun with me
With you?
Yeah, with me!
Come on - I can have loads of fun without you
Without me?
Yeah!",I Wanna Have Some Fun,1995
Full Force,"I love you
And all it takes is just one night alone with me
To show you that there can never be anyone else

All I need is just one night alone
Just one night alone, one night

And as we lay down here together on this soft warm bed
I think back to the time when we first met
And all those memories that just keeps dancin' in my head

I love it when you touch me here
When you touch me there
And when you touch me right here
Show you right

We had so many good times
But the best time was
When I fell in love in just one night

All I need is just one night alone with you
And I'll show you love like you've never seen before
Just one night alone with you, I'm all you need
And I'm sure you'll come for more

The way you make me feel so happy
The way you make me feel so good
That is something I just can't hide

And the way your body touches my body
It penetrates to a feeling deep, deep inside
The way you make love excites me, everywhere

My neck, my lips, my feet, can you see?
But then again, you've got to be real good
In order to make love to me

All I need is just one night alone with you
And I'll show you love like you've never seen before
Just one night alone with you, you're all I want
You're all I need, and I've gotta have you to myself

Oh, I need you so much

Oh yeah, I know you need me because I am the man
And when it comes to makin' love
I am in control, I know this, I mean, I know you're there

But I'm the one who has to get up all the strength
And creativity to do the job that I do
Huh, well speedy lately you've been fast
The next time you do your job try to last

Try to last? Yeah, try to last
Wait, wait a minute, what, what, what do you mean try to last?
You know, at least we can wake up in the morning together
And you can bring me a cup of tea or something

Oh, I just thought when you said try to last I thought
I wasn't doing the job, well
Well, you don't last that long, do you? I mean what's wrong with you?
Oh, you mean when I had my fever? I was sick, sweetheart

I mean, you know, what are you talking about?
It's getting a bit, I mean, look, normally it's the woman
Who get the headaches but that doesn't happen any more
I see that, it's you, the guys are getting all the headaches
These days and it's not happening

Wait a minute, what are you talking about?
I do my thing, I mean, I just had a bad back, that's all
I thought you said it was a headache
Yeah well that too, but you know, give me a break

You've had so many things wrong with you lately
You forgot on which one's wrong now, I'm sleepy
Yeah well, I'm gonna go out and get me some fun
Hey, where are you going? Naughty girls need love too, bye bye

Don't try that, hey, wait a minute, hey, wait a minute
I'm out the door, hey, give me my money, see ya
Hey, nice knowing you
Hey, give me my money

Full Force,"""Maybe, just maybe
Naughty girls need love too.""

I've been told time and time again
That you can't treat love like a game
But I play rough with hearts that never mend
'Cause some guys like you do the same
Love was just a four letter word
Never heard how absurd it could be
But now I can't believe this is real
How I feel now you steal
My heart away from me

Used to be so good and so bad
Sex was just something I had
Used to always know what to do
Now you've got me confused

Baby don't let me be misunderstood
Temporary love's so bad but if feels so good
Then along came you
Now I know its true
Naughty girls need love too
Then came you, then came you

Yes, it's true
I'm in love with you
And believe it baby this time
Your love won't get away
Stay here in the place to be
We can get busy my way
For six forevers and a day-ay-ay
Ooh it's only you I adore
So much more than my body
Was asking for
Yes your love is breaking my chill
Even still there's a thrill
In my heart.

""Samantha Fox was such a wild dame
Huh but what's in a name

Full Force,"Take me home
Take me home

Baby, I know you're wondering
Why I won't go over to your place
'Cause I'm not too sure about how you feel
So I'd rather go at my own pace

And I know and you know that if we get together
Emotions will go to work
And I may do something I might regret the next day
And end the hurt

Oh, I don't know
The way that I feel
I'm so afraid of a one night deal

I wonder if I take you home

Lately, you've been expressing to me
Just how much you want to make love
I want it just as much as you do
But will you still keep in touch?

You say I'm teasin' but I do have a reason
Don't let your feelings fade
'Cause you will have me and sooner than you know it

Your love is
No good

They say beauty lies in the eyes of the beholder
You're not sure you're the holder of my eyes
I gave our relationship more credit than it deserves
No, it's just that I feel you're rushing me

Okay, okay, since you don't love me and don't wanna be with me
No, it's not that, it's just that I'm afraid of getting hurt, I don't know
I just keep asking myself, should I really take you home?
What do you think?

Full Force,"I don't know what he does to make you cry
But I'll be there to make you smile
I don't have a fancy car
To get to you, I'd walk a thousand miles

I don't care if he buys you nice things
Does his gifts come from the heart?
I don't know, but if you were my girl
I'd make it so we'd never be apart

But my love is all I have to give
Without you I don't think I could live
I wish I could give the world to you
But love is all I have to give

When you talk, does it seem like he's not
Even listenin' to a word you say?
That's okay, baby, just tell me your problems
I'll try my best to kiss them all away

Does he leave when you need him the most?
Does his friends get all your time?
Baby please, I'm on my knees
Prayin' for the day that you'll be mine

But my love is all I have to give
Without you I don't think I could live
I wish I could give the world to you
But love is all I have to give to you

Hey girl, I don't want you to cry no more inside, oh
All the money in the world could never add up to
All the love I have inside, I love you, baby

And I will give it to you
All I can give, all I can give
All everything I have is for you
You've got what I got, you you
What I need, my love is all I have to give
All that I have is for you

But my love is all I have to give
Without you I don't think I could live
I wish I could give the world to you
But love is all I have to give

But my love is all I have to give
Without you I don't think I can live
I wish I could give the world to you
But love is all I have to give to you

I have to give
Without you I don't think I could live
Give the world to you lady
But love is all I have to give

But my love is all I have to give
Without you I don't think I could live
I wish I could give the world to you

I can't take these diamonds with me when I day
I can't build that pretty white house in the sky

'Cause I'm not too sure about how you feel

And I know and you know that if we get together
Emotions will go to work
And I may do something I might regret the next day
And end the hurt

Full Force,"Cause she wouldn't give a guy like me no rap
She was walking down the street so I said ""Hello
I'm Kangol from UTFO."" And she said ""So?""
And I said ""So?!? Baby don't you know?
I can sing, rap, and dance in just one show
Cause I'm Kangol, Mr. Sophisticata
As far as I'm concerned ain't nobody greater
From beginning to end and, to beginning
I never lose because I'm all about winning
But if I were to lose, I wouldn't be upset
Cause I'm not a gambler, I don't bet
I don't be in no casino, and baby while you knizzow
The izzi is the grizzeat Kizzangizzo.""
I thought she'd be impress by my devious rap
I thought I had her caught cause I'm a sinister trap
I thought it'd be a piece of cake but it was nothing like that
I guess that's what I get for thinking, ain't that right, black?
Then crizzi to gizzone and seen number izzone
Crizzin ricking tizza of mizzac mic dizza
With the bang bang, brother I feel bad
But I ain't comitting suicide for no crab
But calling her a crab is just a figure of speech
Cause she's an apple, a pear, a plum, and a peach
I thought I had it in the palm of my hand
But man oh man, if I was grand I'd bang Roxanne

Roxanne, Roxanne, can't you understand?
Roxanne, Roxanne, I wanna be your man

Yo Kangol, I don't think that you're dense
Buy you went about the matter with no experience
You should know, she doesn't need a guy like you
She needs a guy like me, with a high IQ
And she'll take to my rap, cause my rap's the best
The educated rapper MD will never fess
So when I met her, I wasted no time
But stuck up Roxanne paid me no mind
She thought my name was Barry, I told her it was Gary
She said she didn't like it so she chose to call me Barry
She said she'd love to marry, my baby she would carry
And if she had a baby, she'd name the baby Harry
Her mother's name is Baby, which is really quite contrary
Her face is really hairy, and you can say it's scary
So isn't not every, her father's a fairy
His job is secondary, in some military
He throws them to an ?electric camp? that wasn't voluntary
His daughter's name is Sherry, his sons are Tom and Jerry
Jerry had the flu but it was only temporary
Back in January, or was it February?
But everytime I say this rhyme it makes me kinda weary
It's only customary to give this commentary
Some say it's bad, some say it's legendary
You can search all you want, try your local library
You'll never find a rhyme like this in any dictionary
But do you know, after all that
All I received was a pat on the back
That's what you get, it happened to me
Ain't that right Mixmaster I-C-E

Roxanne, Roxanne, can't you understand?
Roxanne, Roxanne, I wanna be your man

You thought you had a rose, you thought you was Cupid
But EMD, your rap was plain stupid
I know you're educated, but when will you learn?
Not all girls want to be involved with bookworms
You gotta be strong in a way she can't resist
So educated rapper, huh, bust this...
Since she's a new girl on the block
I had to let her know that I'm the debonoir Doc
I said ""I'd like to speak to you if I can
And if I'm correct your name is Roxanne.""
She said ""How'd you know my name?"" I said ""It's getting around
Right now baby you're the talk of the town
Please let me walk you to the corner, my rap will be brief.""
She said ""I've seen you before, you look like a thief.""
I said ""Me? The Doc? A hood, a rock?
Running around the street robbing people on the block?
Nah, that's not my style, that crime I'm not related
As far as I'm concerned I'm too sophisticated.""
Then it seemed I got busy cause she cracked a smile
That let me know my rap was worth her while
She said ""You call yourself a doctor?"" I said ""This is true.""
She said ""Explain to me really what doctors must do.""
I said ""This is very rare because I don't say this every day
There's a million medical skills a doctor displays
Dermatology is treatment of the skin
Infected and you'll see me and you'll know you're again
There's enthesiology, opthomology
Internal medicine and plastic surgery
Orpedic surgery and pathology
A disease involves a change of the body.""
She said ""Ooooh, that's very unique.""
Gave me her number and kissed me on the cheek
She said she had to go but be back by 8
So to call her at 9 to arrange a date",Roxanne Roxanne (The New Chapter),2014

I got so many styles you'll be thinking I'm from the U.N.
I broke into the White House and never got caught

Always planned this trip

Didn't even know B.
He had the roots he bought the suits

But the boys didn't like him mto tell you the truth
He had ""J.G."" on his pinky ring and he
Lied about doin' some time up in sing-sing

He told his brother Paulie, something had to be done soon.
He took Paulie and a couple of boys and jacked the
Coup de Ville to Illinois.

Two sticks of dynamite and a .38 Snub

Stood outside the gate with his three man demonstartion

Waving picket signs, the C.O. saw a nine;
And only Paulie go away with the skin on his behind.
Back in the borough the cops are acting
Thorough; they raided Franky's room

And then they saw his bureau; upon it was a note,
With a rhyme that was dope, about
How he was breaking John out and how he couldn't cope.

See I'm the fire hose, and everybody knows, that I'll knock you down and kick that ass
So when I go out on the town, straight out of the ground
I ain't lookin' to get on down, it's just one of them things, ask Steve,
me and the fellas, sipping on some Heinekens,
if you know what I'm trying to express through my music

They found a young girl's body
Jigged and beaten and they made it a priority
But the boys in blue couldn't solve the case
Because the girl that hit the curb didn't have no face

They found her on delancy street, christmas eve
No suspect sought, much to my relief
And I said wash your face little girl, for real
Pretend you came back with that mass appeal
Now diamonds for your pearl, clicking and heels
Shaking that ass for extra value meals
And down that part of town, that frightens the masses
Filled with mean motherfuckers and noxious gases

I was stranded in a border town
Believing the motel TV would bring me to safety,
But between MTV and Mr. O'Reilly
I've come to find, that I can't be defined
So I turned it off, now convinced I would cross
Took one last look at the gold
As it shattered on a mountaintop

Now I believe the sun, it's like a symphony.
But what it's trying to play,
I don't know.

We all float before we sink
So pray for satellites,
Pray for courtesy
And pray that it can climb mountains to me!
I say goodbye to the canyon.
I will set sail to the streets
Where I don't care to be forgiven
I want to be forgotten.
I don't care to be forgiven
When Lord I only want to be forgotten!

And what they started to say
Brought me home.

And even though she moved away,
We always get calls from our daughter.

They are blue when skies are grey
And just like him, she never stops,
Never takes the day for granted,

When the doctors tried to take you away.
But like the night you took my hand beside the fire
Thirty years ago to this day
You swore you'd be here 'til we decide that it's our time
Well it's not time, you've never quit in all your life.
So just take my hand, you know that I will never leave your side.
You're the love of my life, you know that I will never leave your side.

You come home from work and you kiss me on the eye
You curse the dogs, you say that I should never feed them what is ours.

How did I end up here?
How did I find love and conquer all of my fears?
See, I made it out.
Out from under the sun.
And the truth is that I feel better because I've forgiven everyone.

Or the stages.

Cannot seem to find my way home tonight
Feels like I am falling down a rabbit hole
Falling for forever, wonderfully wandering alone
What would my head be like
If not for my shoulders
Or without your smile
But follow you forever
May it never leave you
To sleep in the stone, maybe
Stay lost on our way home

C'mon, c'mon, with everything falling down around me
I'd like to believe in all the possibilities

If I should die tonight
May I first just say I'm sorry
For I, never felt like anybody
I am a man of many hats although I
Never mastered anything
But I am ten feet tall
I've never felt this tall since the fall
Nobody seems to know my name
So don't leave me and sleep all alone
Maybe stay lost on our way home

C'mon, c'mon, with everything falling down around me
I'd like to believe in all the possibilities

C'mon, c'mon, with everything falling down around me
I'd like to believe in all the possibilities

Try not to mistake what you have with what you hate

It could leave, it could leave, come the morning

Celebrate the night
It's the fall before the climb

Shall we sing, shall we sing, until the morning

If I fall forward, you fall flat

And if the sun should lift me up
Would you come back?

C'mon, c'mon, with everything falling down around me
I'd like to believe in all the possibilities

C'mon, c'mon, with everything falling down around me

Close the door
Hold the phone

Fun.,"I'm standing in Brooklyn just waiting for something to happen
I can’t help but love thinking that everyone doesn’t get it
To my left there’s a window
Where did I go?
My reflection just planted two rows of coal
And bad ideas, but ideas nonetheless, and so

I put one foot in front of the other one, oh oh oh
I don’t need a new love or a new life just a better place to die
I put one foot in front of the other one, oh oh oh
I don’t need a new love or a new life just a better place to die


I happened to stumble upon a chapel last night
And I can’t help but back up when I think of what happens inside
I got friends locked in boxes, that's no way to live
What you're callin' a sin isn’t up to them
After all, (after all) I thought we were all your children,
But I will die for my own sins thanks a lot
We’ll rise up ourselves thanks for nothing at all,
So up off the ground up our forefathers are nothing but dust now

I put one foot in front of the other one, oh oh oh
I don’t need a new love or a new life just a better place to die
I put one foot in front of the other one, oh oh oh
I don’t need a new love or a new life just a better place to die

Maybe I should learn to shut my mouth
I am over twenty-five and I can’t make a name for myself some nights I break down and cry
I’m lucky that my father’s still alive he’s been fighting all his life
And if this is all I’ve ever known then may his soul live on forever in my song

I put one foot in front of the other one, oh oh oh
I don’t need a new love or a new life just a better place to die
I put one foot in front of the other one, oh oh oh
I don’t need a new love or a new life just a better place to die

In front of the other one

About the birds, the boats, and past loves that flew away or started sinking

And there are people on the street
They're coming up to me
They're telling me that they like what I do now
And so I tried my best when I took the phone

Were cutting like knives in a fist fight
And I found you with a bottle of wine
Your head in the curtains and heart like the fourth of July

At a bar off seventy five 
And we talked and talked about how our parents will die
All our neighbors and wives

But I like to think
I can cheat it all
To make up for the times, I've been cheated on
And it's nice to know
When I was left for dead
I was found and now I don't roam these streets
I am not the ghost you want of me

If you're lost and alone or you're sinking like a stone,
Carry on
May your past be the sound of your feet upon the ground and

I like the give-and-go

And I'm dunking on them like T. Mac
When I'm in the paint I play with that Alonzo style
I'm like Darius cause I can shoot two miles

Don't too many players get offers like me
Back and forth, I'll likely
Shake the checks off your Nikes
They almost had me in a suit at the draft
And it look like a free throw when I be shooting from half
The first step like Iverson - blow past you
Usually nothing but net, but I can go blast too
When I'm in the paint the defense so shook
They don't know if I'ma put up a slow hook, or dish off a no-look
See my game consist of a whole lotta
Moves you would think I learned from the Harlem Globetrotters
J.D. gon lead us to a ring
Fab and Bow Wow the only players that make cheerleaders want to sing

[Chorus]

Now tell me were you in the joint
The night MJ scored 63 points
When the Lakers won titles back to back
didn't give nobody, no kind of slack
When Vince Carter gave and stuck his arm in the rim
Everybody went crazy in the whole damn gym
Dikembe Mutombo standing tall
Playing D with desire, it's basketball

Beautiful bride
And undaunted knight
Are lying in bed, holding hands
Side by side

They started their life
As husband and wife
And now it's time to show

How much they care for each other,
How far they're willing to go?

He moved on real nice
And made her come twice
But then he wanted
To put on some spice

Please hear me prey
I want you to stay
As still as you can be

[Chorus:]
I gave you a taste and you want for more
Let me come to your garden through your back door
Is there anything sweeter in whole wide world
Than ride with this magical wild horse

Oh, I'll taste you in my mouth
My hunger for you makes me howl like a hound
Shout, shout, shout, shout for more
I insist for another round

The wind at my heels,
My body's lifeless age,
Is lost to its feel,

so far away from my home,
Will those stars return,

home is what I need in you,
Salvation in the dreams,

heaven above me,
Water below me how,
Can I survive this,
Swell of the sea,
Bludgeoning me to far,
I cannot stand it,
And I cannot stand it,
Anymore,
And I cannot stand it,
Anymore,
And I cannot stand it,

Mountain is singing fish,
Are fresh from the killing,
Beckoning me return to the sea,
To sleep,
It tries to command it,
It tries to command it,
It tries to command it,

dearest hope has gone away,
Swaying lands so far from me,
Golden hair to palm my sway,
Sweetest wave bring me home,
Bring me home,
Bring me home,
Bring me home,
Bring me home,
Bring me home.

Question the silences, the negative response
Stayed to see the sunrise raising hell over the square
Didn't lose the sense of promise laced upon the air

Education was a simple learning curve
Ruined by the lack of anything to use
Of knowing what to say and what to lock away
Pay attention for detention's here to stay

It took so long to find all the answers through the lies
It's been so long that I don't know if it's alright

Problematic interest never fails to impress
Score cards for everyone, you wear them out to dress
Badge of honor, true to code and true to form
Buried underneath all these expectations

If there was any kind of picture that I could paint for you
I bet you any money that the numbers wouldn't stick for all I know
I'll take some credit for myself if I can
And walk away from this whole scene a happier man

About early times
We could make money, but walked away

We had better things to do these days
Warrior, like a warrior
You were a warrior, like a warrior
Nothing that they said was right

We were fighting for our rights
Nothing that we did was wrong
We chose our thing and called it punk
Somewhere back in your head

Somewhere in your mind
Is there maybe some left with the past so dead
Everything went
Without a fraction left of it
I understand that's just the way it is

[Chorus]

And it's true
Who am I to judge this way
About the kids alive today
Pretend we're better is a big mistake to do

Knowing what we had behind
Don't it seem like better times
When you remember what you were like
Like a warrior in time, like a warrior in time...",Warrior,1995
Funeral Party,"We fell out of progress a long long time ago
Forget what makes us different and then we'll take it slow
Finally we could catch up the things that we lost when the edisons passed away
And go back to the places that we were kids from the real world and just stay

So get up so get out well come on
'Cause we've fallen into ourselves
Well you tell that your lost so hold on
'Cause we'll take it from the shelves
So get up so get out well come on
Cause we fallen into ourselves
And you tell that your lost so hold on
'Cause we'll take it from the shelves

Lets discover a time a place where we gave it all we know
I won't hate you when your not around but I'll hate it when your gone
Cause it's you and I that could save ourselves and it's you and I alone
And no one could ever escape themselves cause you know when you feel at home

And you're counting down the minutes 
To a sad familiar stage

It took only days 

You're moving much faster and I was amazed 
I'm loving your secrets

But to close to get away 
Your doing it now 
You're staying up late 
You're making me nervous 

And I can't wait 
To pull you back into where you belong 
Where sing the same old, same old story 
Same old song And you know just what you do

So pour me one last drink with a final kiss
Things always end up hit or miss

In the backyards where we used to stay
And so your parents are on there way home again
Im so sorry that it had to end

And we'll run back where we started from
We're never leavin' yeah we just begun
Supplies were endless but we just have none
You sleep your whole life and you called it fun

So world and stars and it's gonna stay

You are young and so am I
So take my hands and we can try
You are young and so am I
We'll do all we want and take it while we lie

And your hairs all gray and your shoes are worn
And the books you've read with the pages torn
You saw one person you never knew
It told you what to look forward to

And when you woke up in your sad demise
We're movin' closer to the end of your life

We're getting out of your way
We're movin' out at the end of day

We are the voices under the tracks

Funeral Party,"I saw the ages brought down by fear 
Watch them run off and return for years and years 
Sought out the lights making all lost clear 
As we dried out our blank-stares from ear to ear 

Here we are 
Suit up we're ready to fight the war 
Watch the birds carry on while we settle for more 
Crawled out our house to mend the scars 
As we weld together they fall so far 

Soon all the pieces of broken time 
Held together for seconds what's left to find 
Throw out your backs and hold up your arms 
As we march out the temples return to the stars 

Here we are 
Complicated matters in my frame 
As we make our way out to the sun 
Journey through it all we'll try to tame 
And we're doing it before it's done

I can feel it here deep in your mouth
Truth will reveal itself
No need to travel for a million miles
The years can't stay the same
I kept it easy so I couldn't complain
Let them make up your mind
It's a feeling you can never describe

Oh

But even after all the things I said
You could be honest and be true and never realize what I wont do
Said to call it out, afraid to say
I don't recognize whats left of us I can't think of anything it was
And it was over before
All the things that I know that I could I would never leave you though I would

And I would say it's all because
You ask me why, I cannot lie
And if you shout
And I want out
You ask me why
Oh just because 
Oh just because 
Oh just because 

The claimant change is really nothing new
I'm still lost 'cause I got something to do
I can figure out on my own time you were always late so you're never around
I know no one knows so you can be yourself
I keep you close and never let anyone out
And I stopped caring so push them aside fuck the things you want for the things you like
I get with the money and the swank apartment
I built a tower up into the sun
Let them follow every fallen empire
On the war they waged but never won

I figured out your world, from that today
I swear to god I knew I would but if you give me reason to be good
I always force it out
The words to say
That I'll be honest and be good, you wouldn't leave me if I would
'Cause it was covered
All in disguise
Amazing anger like I lost my mind

Oh I can go, but I will stay
And I'll do it again you could put it away
Oh you can find a peace of mind
You ask me
Oh I can't lie

I found a way that I can go
I make it out through all the years

I found no comfort in these un-crowded street
Calling out for your name I can hear the come
Running faster right behind me
Things were stripped of life with the smoke in the air
I felt the cold wind blowing on my face
Memories of times and the places that were there
I got to pull you out from under this place
What do we do here?

Holding on still breath we're on our way
Breaking through the pieces in the way
Crawling over mountains we can climb
We'll get out in time

The trail had lead me back to the places I had been
The smoke had cleared and opened up the sky
I saw you buried there to my own disbelief
And there were tears all in your eyes
You said now son they can break my heart
But, they will never tear us apart

And, we'll live just to get out of this place
Picking up where we left were on our way

In a typical style, watch the years spread so thin 
Take a step for the first time.

Took a trip out to nowhere. 
Had nothing better too do I'm fed up, 
I'm down and out. 

Could you wait right here for about an hour? 
And I'd like it if things stayed. 
But there changing anyway.

Werft eure Hände in die Luft und fangt sie wieder auf

Mein Schwanz klein und spritzig wie einst Icke Häßler
Beats mein Areal, genial für mich normal, Gedanken surreal, weil dreidimensional
Ich bin der Karl Dall der Reime, der Mike Krüger des Rap
Wie meine Oma sagen würde: „Der Junge hat Pep!“
Wo sie recht hat, hat sie Recht, weil es is so
Wenn Bo kommt könnt ihr einpacken wie Christo
Es ist nicht persönlich, nur meine Meinung
Und weil das meine Platte ist sag ich dir was ich denke
Tut mir Leid wenn ich dich kränke
Wenn ich mit mehr Würze komm als Wenke Myrre

Ohne Dixieland Band

Gekochten Speisen, wir beweisen, du wirst ohne dich zu bewegen reisen
Das heißt
Weil dein Körper sich bewegt, doch nur dein Geist
Weist leider Risse auf, die zu uns wie Pisse auf Wunden wirken
Wir kennen das
Darum wuschen wir die Wunden mit Wasser
Denn wir wirken naß, flüssig, flowin'

Und war bereit für seinen Auftrag
Sein Chef rief ihn rein, sagte „Sitz!“ und Karsten saß
Herr Bölz war fett, 'n Halbglatz mit'm Auge aus Glas
Er behandelte Karsten sehr schlecht und verstand nie was er wollte
Karsten hingegen machte immer, was er sollte
Der Chef erzählte ihm von 'ner Kundin, von wegen 'ner Emanze
Karsten war das Wurst, denn er sah sie als Chance
Hinein in die Freiheit und weg vom Chef
Claudia hingegen war einsam
Sie sah gut aus, doch sie wusste es nicht
Sie ging kaum raus und sie sah nie das Licht
Sie brauchte einen Partner, der sie führte
Er musste nicht schön nur für sie da sein, so, dass sie ihn spürte
Durch einen Freund kam sie zu Karstens Agentur
Er mochte sie gleich, als sie ihm durch die Haare fuhr
Und dachte „Wow, was für eine Frau“

Peter war müde wie nix gutes
Doch meist er eh dann aufstand nahm er 'n Schluck Kölz
Gestern Nacht bis acht durchgemacht, viel gelacht
Doch noch mehr gezecht
Was is' jetzt recht, es geht ihm schlecht
Denn er war wie 'n Kung-Fu-Schaukampf ohne Körperkontakt
Und das schon über 'n Jahr
Sein Geist ist willig doch das Fleisch ist rar
Die Britta war auch nicht fitter
Sie saß allein auf ihrem Sofa und litt da
Denn sie war einsam seit drei Jahren und fünf Monaten
Und ihre Knochen moderten
Weil sie sich nie regte, und wenn dann regte sie sich auf
War ihr Bier alle, alle ach du Scheiße
Bier leer (Bier her, Bier her!)
Doch es is' keiner da, der es ihr bringt
Dann muss sie wohl selber gehen zum Laden an der Ecke
Doch ist man so müde wie sie ist das ne große Strecke
Für Britta jedoch ist nichts schlimmer, als 'ne Stunde ohne
(Uaaa, na dann muss ich wohl los)
Nur zwei Sekunden später denkt auch Peter
„Uaaa, jo dann muss ich wohl los“
Und sie gehen, so müde wie sie sind, sehen auch beide aus
Sie haben mehr Ränder als Augen und man mag es kaum glauben
Während Peter nach dem Bier griff, griff auch Britta
Als sie sich berührten, durchfuhr sie ein Gewitter
Für ihn war sie das, wonach er sich sehnte
Und er fragte sie müde als sie ihn angähnte

I was one of five born to my mother
An older sister and three young brothers
We've seen it hard, we've seen it kind of rough
But always with a smile, she was sure to try to hide
The fact from us that life was really tough

I can hear my mother call
I can hear my mother call (Ah)
Late at night I hear her call
Oh lord, lord I hear her call
She said, ""Father, father it's for the kids (Ah)
Any and every thing I did
Please, please don't judge me too strong
Lord knows I meant no wrong
Lord knows I meant no wrong""

Then the devil sang

""Would you like to dance with me? We're doin' the cosmic slop"" 

She was well known through the ghetto
Tricks would come and then they'd go
The neighbors would talk and call her Jezebel
But always with a smile, she was sure to try to hide
The fact from us that she was catching hell, hey!

Hear my mother call

Like a good fella, I'm a good speller
Yet I get retarded like Hellen Keller
Take it, I'll kick it, better I'll flick it
Just like a booger, I fuck around with hookers
Like Tina Turner, I'm a fast learner
Earning up my wealth, now I go for self
Like Barney Rubble, who's always in trouble
I'm quick on the double, you'll never see me fumble

Ralph rocks a beanie
Flips it, smacks it, do the Michael Jackson

I heard Bruce Leroy
I'm catchin' bullets
With my teeth

Yo, I got no beef
But I'm feelin' iry
That's in my diary
My voice is fiery
Fuck my rivalry
I drink pina colady
I get diabolic
Like the bubonic
Plague
Egg is the shape of my dome
Don't bring it home if you can't use a comb
I side with the Dukes
For all my folks
I rock the crowd and go for broke

I'll do the tango to the Star Spangled
Play the bango then eat a mango
'cause I funk daily

I'm not an Israeli
But I'm hittin' like Halley's
Comet
Drop it
Funk is the topic
I'm off like a rocket
A porno in a pocket
I'm different

I kick the phat funk

Here's a portion
Punk, use caution 
Like Wheel of Fortune
Go round and round
Where will it stop?
I throw hip hop
So I'll never get dropped

Wild like a rodeo
Out there in Kansas.

But cancer kills my society

Correct with the mental and upright with the info
Catching hell, paying dues, but could it be so simple

Surviving's just a job as they dodge caps daily

And thanks to the youth rowdy on the roof top
Who warned me of trouble, so son get the bonus

Nightmares and troubles, remembering the vision
Times is frustrating when nobody listens
Is this because they forget and regret 
To acknowledge one another, but all do respect

Keep your eyes on the prize, see you soon wish you well

pussy lips wrinkled, the wet soft and nappy
a menstrating cycle that's never acting happy
hormones, metapause, cramps yo I wonder
pussy can't bury niggas six feet under
others won't listen, vaginas all busted
Son's so disgusted, can't be trusted
infested, dirty with the monostat 7
rotten was the clitoris and pussy lips infected
remember I said the first time it came to me
now I look back and shit it's all the same to me

Verse 1:
Our sons done it, the gods never fronted
whore nuns fuck a devil when the weight got hunted
my soul was swepping, my mind keep stepping
in the depths of hell yet I fell from the lesson
my soul leaves the body the situations nody
original invisible to the ones who are tardy
a class for the better, cause I be writing letters
setting shit straight one laugh at one shepard
her face turns purple and demons in the surb
I held my breathe and I left out the wound kinda fertile
from the east the light shines onto the west
a test for the gods cause that's just where they rest
a tune for serenity, fucking up the enemy
if anyone makes it then that's the way its ment to be

nobodys soul yet the devil keeps playing
and kicked out the heavens I rest on the seven
west of 85 if your chest type are warring
now is the mystery one peace for victory
cause I know gods that will put you out your mysery
justice will lead em, deprived you of freedom
the beat broke the seal even though you don't need em
the beats and the Harlet, the land is a target

messing with Eve cause she wasn't certain
nobodys got a temper, a spiritual dilemma
enter in the realm where the spirits in the center
fuck perpetrating, cause they'll murder Satan
see faith broke the seal while the world be waiting
he left it all to Jesus, I'm picking up the pieces
friends that's deceased can never read my thesis
don't be resurrected and times got so hectic
demons ain't elected while the money gets collected
the gods get theirs and the word is born
I mean the signs of the future is what they saw

Funkdoobiest,"Yeah, Funkdoobie in the house...
1994, representing....keeping it real...one time

I step out the door, and left undisturbed
I made the beer run and saw them hookers on the curb
Them pimps got the curls, rollers fancy fur coats
Talking to the brothes in the alley, the word
The party's at 7, and girls are with their babies
The kids are playing handball and it's about 80
I rolled out with T-Funk, in the t-bird
Pump the t-bass, hell of course, then we made that you-turn
The doobie got rolled up, the homies had showed up 
'Cause we made a left and saw the liquor store hold up
Stopped at the light, acting like nothing happened
We went about our way, brothers domino slapping
Pulled up on the side to see what girls were wearing
T popped the top and had all the hookers staring

Chorus
On the real, the real, what the deal
For my brothas who live and die on the corner
(Oh Yeah in background reapeated)
(4x)

Brothas shootin see-lo, try to meet expenses
Homies at the park tired, sleep on benches
Standing buy the payphone, make the call to Ralph Ms
(-Yo Ralph, what's up nigga?
 -Yo what up dawg?
 -What time you want to get up tonight?
 -Around 10
 -Word
 -Yo what's all that noise in the back man?)
Homies getting loud right in front of my building
The street lights came on, a cool breeze feeling
For the nights what i need, my aura feels special
What's up to my neighbors, the day had settled
Brothers want to hustle on the corner, scheming
Then i ran back and got ready for that evening

Chorus

I'm at the party drunk and my homies look dusted
The music was blasting, look here, but what's this
I hear about a hooker who wants to get with T-Funk
The room was kinda hot, holusinate and see 1
See 2 girls by the hallway, all day
Staring at my grill, these females want to play
Girls dim the lights and dance 'til the morning
My crew was in the house, saw these hookers tip-toeing
To the back with the homies, you know the rest
It was late that night, after everyone had left
Some urled in the streets, others gave out their numbers
I then grabbed my coat, had the ride home covered
Leaving with this girl from my block that i took
I said peace to the homies, now i'm out to hit the hooker

Chorus

Oh Yeah(fades with song)",What the Deal,1995

Can't be too great a task

Venus, if you do
I promise that I always will be true
I'll give her all the love I have to give
As long as we both shall live

Hey, Venus, oh, Venus
Make my wish come true",Venus,2000
Funkmaster Flex,"Pop goes the gat, I get over like a fat rat
Funkmaster Flex and 9 Double M, mad fat
Skills on the table and the mic
With that (six million ways to die) flavor all night
Clean up the cuss when I bust mother (woop)
I'm on some new and improved shit, let me kick it
Crazy motherfucker from the Boogie Down, brother
I smack shit, flip shit, kick shit, I rap shit
Flex on the wheels and I'm Nine Mil the gat
That's how we roll, troop
We give em 187 like Dre and Snoop
Three little six little nine double M's
Sticking up rappers like hems
Back on the scene from the Bronx and I stomp nuff comp
Six million ways to die, punk

I bring drama like you spit on my momma
And get loose like the lips on Madonna
You get the picture when the rap style hits ya
I run on more niggas than the Jews at a Bar Mitzvah
When I'm splashing my rap transaction
Hard rocks turn white like Michael Jackson
I blow spots and bust shots at hard rocks
And leave you laying in a box with Red Foxx
I keep wild like James Brown doing judo
And have you making love songs like Menudo
The Son of Sam when I aim for your head
Jack the Ripper leave your whole town red
You can't kill me because I'm already dead
I drop flavor like a pack of Now & Laters
And get loose like the feet on Sammy Davis
You know my style, it's the hardcore rhymer
Pass the mic and I get loose like a vagina

Hoo hah! I'm funky, so shut your face and let me rip it
Like butter on a biscut, Nine Double M is wicked
I put the funk in the place with a dunk in your face
And watch you catch a knot like a shoelace
I'm not the one that was begging for a nut like a squirrel
That's like Farrakhan kissing a white girl
I rag it like the Bloods and Crips
I flip scripts, read my lips:
I got mad skills for the no frills
Screaming at girls to pay bills
I got more rap than a Christmas gift
And I'll fill your girl's mouth like grits
Have her chewing while I'm ba-ba-ba booing
It's back to the mic check, one two and
Back up off the gat cause I snap necks

When I get stupid to the point that I'm mentally mad 

My rhymes start to flow  so I simply must brag 

About my style that makes you vibrant  I keep drivin 

Until the song turns me to a hip hop giant 

Me and Marley Marl  we're goin one on one 

For any sucker rapper that chooses to come 

And for me Craig G a/k/a The Kingpin 

I drop science, can't you tell how I'm singing? 

They hate how I tie my mic cord to a whip

Rappers: Ask yourself the same question 

Why am I best in this profession? 

Is it because you're scared to step to me, yo 

Or the things Marley does in the studio? 

I drop science as if I was Butterfingers 

And I know there's not another singer 

In this lifetime to kick the right rhyme 

Cause there's not another rhyme quite like mine 

And when it comes to havin showmanship 

I really don't care who you go and get 

Cause rappers hate me, I'm so defiant 

And I can get stupid just by droppin science

We'll be the dopest duo comin outta Queensbridge 

Now crews hate us cause we're extraordinaire 

For you to beat us? Hm, I think that's sort of rare 

These rhymes are dope, that's how I transmit 

And sized perfectly, so that they can fit 

You're steppin to us? You need traction 

Or you'll be another sucker missin in action 

You hate to hear it? You'll learn to love it

Funkmaster Flex,"I came in the door, I said it before
I never let the mic magnetize me no more
But it's biting me, fighting me, inviting me to rhyme
I can't hold it back, I'm looking for the line
Taking off my coat, clearing my throat
The rhyme will be kicking until I hit my last note
My mind remains refined, all kind of ideas
Self-esteem makes it seem like a thought took years to build
But still say a rhyme after the next one
Prepared, never scared, I'll just bless one
And you know that I'm the soloist
So Eric B make 'em clap to this

I don't bug out or chill or be acting ill
No tricks in '86, it's time to build
Eric be easy on the cut, no mistakes allowed
Cause to me, MC means move the crowd
I made it easy to dance to this
But can you detect what's coming next from the flex of the wrist
Say indeed and I'll proceed cause my man made a mix
If he bleed he won't need no band-aid to fix
His fingertips sew a rhyme until there's no rhymes left
I hurry up because the cut will make 'em bleed to death
But he's kicking it cause it ain't no half stepping
The party is live, the rhyme can't be kept in-
Side, it needs erupting just like a volcano
It ain't the everyday style or the same old rhyme
Cause I'm better than the rest of them
Eric B is on the cut and my name is Rakim

Go get a girl and get soft and warm
Don't get excited, you've been invited to a quiet storm
But now it's out of hand cause you told me you hate me
And then you ask what have I done lately
First you said all you want is love and affection
Let me be your angel and I'll be your protection
Take you out, buy you all kinds of things
I must have got you too hot and burned off your wings
You caught an attitude, you need food to eat up
I'm scheming like I'm dreaming on a couch with my feet up
You scream I'm lazy, you must be crazy
Thought I was a donut, you tried to glaze me",Eric B. Is President,1995
Funkmaster Flex,"I'm your idol, the highest title, numero uno
I'm not a Puerto Rican, but I'm speakin so that you know
And understand I got the gift of speech
And it's a blessin, 
So listen to the lesson I preach,
I talk sense condensed into the form of a poem,
Full of knowledge, from my toes to the top of my dome,
I'm kinda young, but my tongue speaks maturity,
I'm not a child, I don't need nothin for security
I get paid when my record is played, to put it short,
I got it made,

I'm outspoken,
My language is broken into a slang,
But it's just a dialect that I select when I hang,
I play it cool, 'cause coolin is all that I'm about
Just foolin wit tha girlies, yes I'm bustin it out,
I'm Special Ed and you can tell by the style that I use,
I'm creatively superior, yo, I never lose
I never lost 'cause I'm the boss,
I never will 'cause I'm still,
The champion, chief one, won't lose until,
I choose,

Which I won't 'cause I don't retreat,
I'll run you over like a truck and leave you dead in the street,
You're invitin me, a titan to a battle, why?
I don't need your respect 'cause I,
Got it made,

I'm talented, yes I'm gifted,
Never boosted, never shoplifted,
I got the cash, but money ain't nothin,
Make a million dollars every record that I cut and,
My name is Special Ed and I'm a super-duper star
Ever other week I get a brand new car,
Got twenty, that's plenty yet I still want more,
Kinda fond of honda scooters, got seventy-four
I got the riches, to fulfill my needs
Got land in the sand of the West Indies,
Even got a little island of my very own,
I gotta frog, a dog with a solid gold bone,
An accountant to account the amount I spent
Gotta treaty with Tahiti 'cause I own a percent
Got gear out wear, to everyday
Boutiques from France to the U.S.A.
And I make all the money from the rhymes I invent,
So it really doesn't matter, how much I spent, because, yo
I make fresh rhymes, daily
You burn me, really?
Think, just blink and I made, a million rhymes
Just imagine if you blinked, a million times
Damn I'd be paid,
I got it made,

I'm kinda spoiled,
'Cause everything I want I got made
I wanted gear, got everything from cotton to suede
I wanted lead, I didn't beg I just got laid
My hair was growin too long, so I got me a fade
And when my dishes got dirty, I got Cascade
When the weather was hot, I got a spot in the shade
I'm wise because I rise to the top of my grade
Wanted peace on Earth, so to God I prayed
Some kids across town thought I was afraid
They couldn't harm me,
I got the army brigade,
I'm not a trader,
If what you got is greater I'll trade,
But maybe later 'cause my waiter made potato n' alligator souflee,
I got it made",I Got It Made,1995

And Rip van Winkle fell the hell asleep
And Alice stilled her hunger in Wonderland
Jack Jill busta in his hand
And Jam Master Jay is making out our sound
The turntables might wobble but they don't fall down

I got the juice and Mother Goose both did that thing
Jam Master's gettin' loose and DMC's the king
Cause he's adult entertainer, child educator
Jam Master Jay, king of the crossfader
He's the better of the best, best believe he's the baddest
Perfect timin' when I'm climbin', I'm a rhymin' apparatus
When he cuts, girls move their butts
His name is Jay, hear the play, he must be nuts
And on the mix, real quick, and I'd like to say
He's not fat, but he's fast and his name is Jay

It goes a one, two, three and

Jay's like King Midas, as I was told
Everything that he touched, turned to gold
He's the greatest of the great, get it straight he's great
Playing fame cause his name is known in every state
His name is Jay to see him play will make you say
""Goddamn, that DJ made my day!""
Like the butcher, the baker, the candlestick maker
He's a maker, a breaker, and a title taker
Like the little old lady who lived in a shoe
If cuts were his, he would be you
I'm not lying, y'all, he's the best I know
And if I lie, my nose will grow
Like the little wooden boy named Pinocchio
And you all know how the story goes!

Tricks are for kids he plays much gigs
He's the big bad wolf and you're the three pigs
He's the big bad wolf in your neighborhood
Not bad meaning bad, but bad meaning good!

There it is

We're Run-DMC, got a beat to settle
D's not Hansel, he's not Gretel
Jay's a winner, not a beginner

You've been waitin' and debatin' for oh so long
Just starvin' like Marvin for a Cool J. song
If you cried and thought I died, you definitely was wrong
It took a thought, plus I brought Cut Creator along
Evened up with E-Love down with the Cool J. force
Symbolizin' in the rhymin' for the record of course
I'm a tower full of power with rain and hail
Cut Creator scratch the record with his fingernail

True as a wizard, just a blizzard, I ain't taken no crap
I'm rhymin' and designin' with your girl in my lap
The bass is kickin' always stickin' cause you like it that way
You take a step because it's def and plus it's by Cool J.
Cut Creator on the fader, my right-hand man
We rock the bells so very well cause that's the name of this jam
Rock the bells

Some girl's will like this jam and some girls won't
Cause I make a lot of money and your boyfriend don't
L.L. went to hell, gonna rock the bells
All you washed up rappers want to do this well
Rock the bells

Now I'm world-wide known, whether you like it or not
My one man band is Cut Creator a.k.a. Philpot

The bells are circulatin' the blood in your veins
Why are girlies on the tip, L.L.'s your name
Cut Creator's good, Cool J. is good-good
You bring the wood pecker, I'll bring the wood
The bells are wippin' and rippin' at your body and soul
Why do you like Cool J., we like rock and roll
Cause it ain't the glory days with Bruce Springsteen
I'm not a virgin so I know I'll make Madonna scream
You hated Michael and Prince all the way, ever sense
If their beats were made of meat, then they would have to be mince
Rock the bells

So listen to the lines of rhyme, I rhyme on time
He'll cut the record in a second, make your DJ look blind
So all you jerry-curl suckers wearin' high-heel boots
Like ballerinas, what I mean is you're a fruit-loop troop
All you gonna-be(s), want to-be(s), when will you learn
Want to be like Cool J., you gotta wait your turn
Some suckers don't like me, but I'm not concerned
Six-g (s) for twenty minutes is the pay I earn
I'm growin' and glowin' like a forest blaze

No need, for you to ever sweat the next bitch
With speed, I make the best bitch see the exit, indeed,
You gotta know your thoroughly respected by me,
You get the keys to the Lexus, with no driver
You gotcha own '96 suh-in, the ride
And keep your ass tighter than Versace that's why
You gotta watch your friends you got to watch me
They conniving shit
The first chance to crack the bank
They try me, all they get is 50 cent franks
And papayas, from the village to the tele
Time to kill it on your belly no question
I got more black chicks between my sheets than Essence
They say sex is a weapon, so when I shoot
Met your death in less than 8 seconds
Still poundin' in my after life

And wrinkle the face like linnin'
I play hard-eh till they say God
He's keepin' it real jigga stay hard

Yo, ain't no stoppin' this, no lie
Promise to stay monogamous, I try
But love you know these ho's be makin' me weak

Bank rolls and shit, back rubs in the french tubs
Mackin' this bitch, wife nigga
So when you flip that coke
Remember them days you was dead broke
But now your style and I raised you
Basically made you into a don
Flippin' weight, heroin and shit
You know my pussy is all that
That's why I get bagets 5 carats and all that
From Dolce Gabana to H Vendell I'm ringin' bells
So who the playa, I still keep you in the illest gators
Tailor made so we can lay up in the shade reminiscin'
On how I fuck the best a shit
Specially when I'm flippin' Baileys
Don't give a fuck about how you move with them other mamis
I push da Z, eating shrimp scampi with rocks larger than life
Fuck them Reebok broads, you made it known who your wife was
I got you frontin' in Armani sweaters
Before this rap shit
When you was in letters and bullshit berattas
And eek classes with mo in the glasses
Shows in Cali wit all the flavor suede Bally's
Now all your mens' up in your benz's
High post, I swear you be killin' me
Playin' inside my pubic hairs
I never worry bout them other chicks
Cause you proved who was your wiz
When you was spinnin' that bitch
I took a little when you was up north
Your commissary stay pilin'
How you livin' large on the island
All them collects have me vex
But when you come home
Knew I was comin' off wit half of dem checks
Now we on the rise

Young bitch from the street, guaranteed to stay down
Used to bring work outta town on Greyhound

Play me like a chicken, thinkin' I'm pressed to get it

Rather count a million while you eat my pussy
Push me to the limit get my feelings in it
Get me open while I'm cummin' down your throat
Then, you wanna be my main squeeze nigga
Don't cha, you wanna lick between my knees nigga

Now what be the shit that make them niggas think 
When they ship come in, they ship won't sink 
Everybody you meet on your way up, you meet down 
So if you burn a bridge how you gonna cross town 
Think about it now and cry later

And everytime I get them visions in my head 
Everything is red, gettin high from the stimuli

Showin mothafuckers I be down for shit 
Real quick to do my justice 
Walk the streets and stay close to my musket 
Bust this, everytime I hit the corner I notice at night 
Niggas always want to see a fight, crowd around it like 
Cause a scene, some dumb nigga might pop off a shot 
In the air for props, followed by the cops and the ghetto bird 
Swoop down and hit them niggas while they standin on the curb 
What a herb, kick off a shot in the air 
Make the crowd shatter, kid you should've splurged 
Now all I see is a fleet of DT's 
Comin in the direction of be	-D-be	 
Kick up dust, can't get bust, duckin darts 
See they want to shoot the god

You can bounce to this in your 5 double-0

Yo  I'm the problem nigga's got  but scared to step to it 
If a nigga really want it with me? Let's do it 
See cats in the club  it's just music 
Thieves and killers'll tell ya  I just proved it 
I set the tone  ya nigga's adjust to it 
Spit bars  nigga's do sets and rep's to it 
I'm the type that get 30 years and rep through it 
Want it wit' us? Come put your best to it 
Come clean now, I'll send these tests to it 
I should get a Nike contract the way I ""Just Do It""

Come on B.S. and leave on it

Any man call me fam', got at least a brick 
Shut the whole morgue down just for Easter kicks 
When I'm down and out and I need the chips 
Vietnam will be how I leave your script 
And it take dough just to reach the rich 
So can't no senator impeach my 
And don't rush to be somethin' that you're not 
Reworn up lies, keep guns cocked

Yea yea yea Dr. Dre up in here y'all know what this is.
It's what y'all been waiting for Funk Master Flex, Big Kap,
Def Jam Records giving it to you baby.
Yo Eminem show these mother fuckers what time it is baby

I used to be a lonely man, only mad, until I got a million dollars, shit
Now if I only had some fucking hair I'd pull it, faster than a bullet
Out of Tupac's chest before the ambulance came too late to do it
I'm trying to grow it back again, it was an accident

I had my back against the fan and chopped it off in Amsterdam
I hate the straight jacket it ain't latching, and can't lock it
So they stapled my hand to my pants pockets
The cell's padded and battered like someone else had it

Before me, and just kept throwing they fucking self's at it
My head is aching, I'm dedicated to medication
But this med is taking to long to bring me this sedation? (Come on!)
Anyway I got down with Dre (What up?) 

The first man who taught me how the glock sounded to spray
Running up and down the street screaming, ""Fuck the Police""
When you still had your mother's fucking Nipple stuck in your teeth
(Fucking baby) Became a role model after Colorado

Now all they do is follow me around and holla Bravo!
Hell yea I punch my bitch and beat my kids in public
Suck my dick, bitch
I'm sick enough to fuck a man in his face but I won't

'Cause you'll probably want to stand in his place
So put a sock in it, with your fake-ass Tupac image
You faggots ain't tough, you just get drunk and become talkative
(Want to Fight?) I'm probably the awkwardest alcoholic talking

Walking like a midget with a ladder in his back pocket
So when you see me on your block stumbling, mumbling
A bunch of dumb shit like my drunk uncle does
I ain't buzzed, I'mm juss high on life

So why on earth would I need drugs, when I can fly on kites?

Don't get so bent out of shape 

'Cause I went out and raped six girlfriends
Some people just don't get it, but I won't let it upset me
'Cause they don't know better
They don't know what the fuck its like to be so fed up

And fed so many uppers you're down and won't get up
My mind's got a mind of it's own, sometimes I can't find it at home

And Dirty Dozen watches over me so try some dumb shit

And shove his head in the fan blade
Don't ever tell me what I can and what I can't say
Or change cause of the age range in my fan base
Like I give a fuck who's buying this shit

Quit fucking buying it, I'm tired bitch, I'm dying to quit
Hip Hop is universal now, it's all commercial now
It's like a circle full of circus clowns up in the circuit now
But now the white kids like it, so they tell me I can buy it

But as soon as I get on the mic it's like the night get silent
Either that or booed, that's why I keep an attitude
And go to sleep with it and wake up with it every afternoon

That why'all (that why'all)
It's like that why'all (that why'all)
That why'all (that why'all)
That why'all, It's murda

Respect a thug, or accept a slug
Or accept the death of somebody you love
That's the rules we live by, ways I kiss by
We all murderers in the eyes of all ours
So when I pull a bubble up and back in your car
When I spit sixteen's you gonna wish they was sparks
Can you hold something, you can hold heat you can keep
Slugs in your sleep while I'm plugging your freak
I'm the thug of the week, the killer of the millennium
Spitting like mack ten and a nine ??
Blasting off like Flex on New Years
Who cares how many slugs why'all spit in the air
Niggaz over here got glock nineteen's, P89's, hollow points, and M16's
Three fifty-seven's and mack11's 
We clap you come to the funeral...

Motherfucker if your holding them ?? nigga
Then I'd advise nigga, we rip the high niggas
Don't matter the size niggaz
Ever since I popped up, a lot of niggaz done got stuck
While I'm laying the cut, meant that's rocked up
Believe it's murda
Niggaz get popped up, buried and chopped up
We don't give a fuck if the cops get touched
A ?? and a baby blue drop
With a stash box holding a fifth and two glocks
And every sixteen I spit I ??
And won't stop firing, firing until I got, a four full of money
And playboy you bunny
Yo you get us a clip of hollow tip slugs from me
Bitch nigga, acting out the life of a thug money
I hustle and, grind those block for drug money
And make sure, kept counting every stack
We drop bombs like Flex and Big Kap

[Chorus:]
Fuck that

Oh why must children die
I guess the lil' nigga want the piece of the pie, let 'em die
Oh why must thug niggaz snitch
I guess the lil' nigga thought he'd get a lil' rich, lil' bitch 
That's why we don't talk quick
'Cause niggaz who talk quick get killed for the bricks
This is it, that's why we walk with our guns
'Cause those without guns get killed by guns

?? the one that will kill you son
It's the same where ever we from, it's the slums
We spit guns, lay you down for the 1
I love when niggaz talk slick with they tongue
You ain't buying no one, you talking shit
I'm from the place get killed for shit
So fuck where you from, better start from day 1
It's amazing...


Murda mommy in every song
You was warned, should of listened when I told ya
It's coming to a closure
And almost over now
Go to war like a solider now
And you rat broads running my style, I'm shutting you down
From N.Y. to L.A., Vi-ta from Jersey
More of a bitch then a lady
Chase chips, slick bitch
With flows that's sick, and it only gets worse...

[Chorus:]
Fuck that

Murda, is the way of the walk
And since I walk a thin line, I'm looking at niggaz with dead eyes
And I'm baptized, my body has sinned
A lil' weed, a few hoes, and a whole lot of head
Got me hollering, I don't give a fuck!
About nothing at all, front
I'm blasting off, killing you with probable cause
'Cause you probable of thinking that you hotter then I
It will never be until I die, and touch the sky
Hells angel, fly
I feel like I'm at war fighting for my inner self fighting for my life
This world made me a, Murderer
May the lord take you, before I murder ya
Bodies turning up, and who you think got 'em all touched

I guess its time to pick a different weapon, man this shits depressing.
But swift gettin' me a new one for a Christmas present
Come on slim lets go and teach this fuckin' bitch a lesson
They managed to confiscate the pistol that I ?
But the plan is to use this bullshit to my advantage.

It's gettin' hard to dodge the women
But I'm still pitching hard white balls
Faster than Roger Clemens,
Ya know the kid with the O's
That's as large as linens
When it comes to sellin' trees
I'm as large as Timberland
My lawyer got my charges slimmin'
He said the only way I am goin upstate
If it's in larger swimmin'
Pull out the garage like gremlins
Anarge with trimmins
System in it that have the projects tremblin'
Ya know nothin' about lettin' a few strays go off
Ya only reach for your hip when your two ways go off
Shots'll fly by your head
Your toup blow off
I ain't crip I'm just a blue gray show off
Ghetto fab I more than rap for my bucks
Keep two 9's on me like Warren Sapp from the Buccs
The word I'm ballin' be flowin' to the fed Jakes
And I keep chicks on my lap throwin' me head fakes
Nigga I walk around with the grams you stackin'
And me and Flex don't roll unless they Andrew Jackson

Run em in do the same to another nigga
Once again it's a I S bill, we need Cockrine fierce(?)
Yo we gotta do something Cause they not gonna fear us.
Fuck that, my man Jay used to play for the Dogers
Hurt his hand string now he watches
Got hoes topless and other hoes totally nude
But he keep them to his self and me supposed to be schooled
Type of nigga that I'll show me the wolves and try to pet them
Getting to hot I perspire venom I put the fire in them
Make it so they never cool off 
And when the snow clears tell them who lost
They don't hear me though

Now days cats and middleman, little man, ain't controlling shit
Talk about holding bricks, but ain't holding dick
Niggas talk real slick, but that's about it
Soon as I see 'em headed my way, I cut them off quick
Must you beat me in my head everytime I come through?
It's shit like, everybody tells me I sound just like you
But you got me, got me? And you can't live without me
If I wasn't DMX, you wouldn't give a fuck about me
Ain't about ""Dog I want to be just like you""
How about you wanting to be just like you?
You can do what I do, just in your own way
Shit, I get niggas that ride big every fuckin' day (I-ight?)
If you got talent, talent is yours, it can't be mine
And it take you where it's gon' take you, it'll be fine

Hey yo dog, I got lyrics
Hey yo dog, I got beats (Word)
Damn, is this the type of shit I gots to put up with in the streets?
Used to be able to walk, not have to talk to nobody
Everywhere I go it's like I bring the whole party
It ain't about tryin' to follow or tryin' to be like
But if we all see it through the eyes of the Lord, we see a light (c'mon)
Just let me get a hold of the mic, I'll teach you a little something
Now the good things that go wrong because of a little frontin'
Express yourselves, be who you are, umm umm, you're a shining star
You don't even know what you got inside
How the fuck you gon' find out, you keep wanting to ride
Hey yo, I ain't gon' let it slide no more
You're best to go for what you know
Can't do you, then what you flow for
You ain't gon' get there tryin' to be me, dog

Like fuck it, you want to be me? Here's what you do
Grow up neglected by both parents and still pull through
You gots to come up fucked up, get treated like shit
Then have your mother's new boyfriend smack you like a bitch
Turn into a killer, don't carry shottie
'Cause the way it's goin' down right now, you gon' kill somebody
Get a dog, walk the streets, learn what you need to learn
Better have a cause but because you'll get burned
You got 15 years without ever coming out
And beat your fist at the world and what they talkin' about
Then get locked up every two years
For two years keep it real, hold back all tears, face your fears
Become a man before your time, rap but live out your rhymes
Let 'em know what's on your mind, then you'll get your shine
In time, everything you hear will come true
But you won't be doin' me, you'll be doin' you

I mark your mistake as soon as you're rested, I heard of ya
Unattended for your double breasted, bulletproof vest kid
Time is money well invested, burning your press kit
Ya HEARD me, chic-ow, bless it and pass it leftwards
Never protested, the living proof manifested
Winkled your face, you better press it, menage-a-trois
Put fist in thought, care to test it?  If you dare I swear
Motionless, I throw a stare in the eyes of uncommon wise soldier
Rise like Nike, shares growing older, snowball effect to snow boulder
Show you love nigga, I'm iceberg with cold shoulder
No time for your manic, hazy rap attack partner
Future darker than black permanent black... marker
I part you from existence on solid ground
Only twelve inch but long distance, that's all I frown
Is we hell or is we heaven bound?
I bomb the target without a sound
Ain't nobody left around to hear it
Sipping fine wine and spirits on summer days
By the South Pacific, cheddar sound better when specific
Cheddar look better when explicit
Cheddar get better when statistics rise like mama biscuits
All 'n all, I'm having fun with gun
'Cause world gave me gun, detonate the shells with my tongue
I'm young plus I'm well hung
Threat to intellect, also got your prize possession sprung
I ride the fine line between yours and mine, check the design
Bre-X cats wondering how rhyme turn sublime
Peep my shines coming from behind
I'm high beaming in your rear view
Get out the left lane before I steer through
Ain't even trying to hear you
It was important 'til you thought I feared you
Naw, loosen your bra bitch
Never rest until I'm considered, the high exalted
Even then I'll still be bitter, sipping on malted
Through the speech, now it's time to walk it
This potent poet, who only spit it if he know it
Prefer to show it to the hardest of hip hop artist
If you a baby making baby, finish what you started and be a MAN
God damn, resort to plan be	 sucking on candy
For delicate procedure, no time for leisure
The fine line between yours and mine, freak the design
Bre-X cats wondering how rhyme turn sublime
Peep my shines coming from behind
I'm high beaming in your rear view, CRASH
I stop at nothing, my blood stream pumping nothing but utter destruction
Towards cats I describe in this rap production
Suffering from mal concussions, you head bangers catching repercussion
First impression had you lustin'
Now the name Saukrates ringing more than bells
Double X-L quote me well, bringing the future
Double X-L quite me well, bringing the future
You want to poise for the portrait, here let me shoot you",Fine Line,2000

Ginuwine, Funkmaster Flex
In your earhole, whoo!
Drop a bomb to this, what?
Let's do this, listen

Saw her in the club
As she was about the finest thing I had ever seen
I was so addicted cause she was like a drug
And I was a fiend
I wanted to walk over
Imagining her body was calling me
I had to get with it and make it quick
I had to hit cause baby girl was a dream
I wanted to say

1 - How would you like it if I...
Touched a little
Felt a little
Grabbed a little
Could you handle if I...
Licked a little
Taste a little
Ate a little

Repeat 1

Yo second verse
Kept staring at her hoping that she would see
And maybe call me over
I was gifted but my confidence wouldn't let me
So I sat back and thought things over
(What I get?)
Got a bottle of the Cris (Oh)
Got a bottle of the Mo (Oh)
Now I'm looking like a Don Juan
So I know she gotta notice me
Over all the others
Cause they be singing all the same songs

Repeat 1 (2x)

Finally walked over to her
Told her she was the finest woman I had ever seen
She told me why'd I take so long
Cause all night she was already peepin' me
She said she likes a man who knows what he wants
Never fronts and ain't scared to ask
She was down for whatever
So I took her to the floor, got together
And I tapped that ass, yeah

Repeat 1 (2x)

Yo Flex take em there

Then put it back in and shoot you in the back if you run
Call me Jada, I love to clap the shit out a hater
Give my lawyer seven then give him another three later
Cause you know it cost a hundred to beat it
And I lost plenty fights, but my gun is still undefeated
Cause I'm tryin to be around like Boston Baked Beans
Gave so many samples out, that it's hard to shake fiends
Since a young boy, I was taught to mind my neck
And since a grown man, I was taught to sign my checks
And I don't want drama, but if you do I'm killin your children
Go to any project in the world and chill in the buildin
Hit me later, I think not, I keep the glock
And drive around with no coat cause my seats is hot
Fuck buyin a Range, if I ain't with my son I'm gettin high
or either with my niggaz, at the firin range
While why'all clown niggaz keep jokin, and get treated like ashes

Smells like smoke
It smelled like smoke
Or smells like the stench of a Saturday night
The ceiling broke
The neighbors woke to the rain when I woke to the orange light
One minute I'm burning then I'm soaked in the fire fight
The fire drowned and the rain it choked tonight
Kicking up the dirt.
You kick your spurs to the sun.
It isn't what you do, it's what you've done

Someone said you died last night, but that you were fine.
When you came to the church on Sunday you were looking like
Saturday night
Someone said you died last night but that you were fine.
And when you came to the church on Sunday, you were looking like Saturday night

The Buggies climb in when the kids climb out.
Well there are polka dots of buggies, where the screen ripped out.
The yellow toys swim through a dusty filth.
They've got to break down the homes that the buggies have built.
It's when they're kicking up the dirt, they kick their spurs to the sun
And when they buggies they sting kiddies they run

Someone said you died last night, but that you were fine
When you came to the church on Sunday, you were looking like Saturday night

Speedin' on the highway
Starin' at the white lines we rollin', we rollin' (white lines)

High speed baby!
It's two o'clock in the mornin', I'm stompin' down on the pedal
Look at my ring on the steering wheel and my ice on the bezel
I made a promise to god that I would run from the devil
When the engine is gunnin' I'm on a whole other level
White lines connected, I'm livin' life like a rebel
My competition is chokin' inside my dust when it settle
Baby look at me now, I'm just a kid from the ghetto
But I'm on top of my hustle, I move the bass and the treble
And I go at your generation, I'm runnin' this era
Ain't no lookin' behind me, my system shakin' the mirror
Top speed in the beamer, my head boppin' to ""ether""
I'm on I-95, clutch burnin' the reefer
Everybody that rides with me becomes a believer
Cause I come from the hood, but I think like a caesar
Went from 0 to 60, four deep in the bentley
Hell yeah I be speedin', that's why niggas resent me; ugh!

[Chorus]

Yeah, uh
I said to hell with the past, it's time to live for the future
Make the muffler backfire and pop like a ruger
Don't have the slightest idea 'bout who you ridin' with do ya?
Just keep your eye on the white lines, feel 'em goin' through ya
Between the lines my mind works like a normal computer
My adrenaline's rushin' like I've been dodgin' the shooter
I get surgical on the road every line is a suture
And you must be a operator if niggas dispute ya
Peelin' off in a hurry, there ain't no reason to worry
Anybody that challenges me is gonna get buried
12 cylinders gunnin' the whole world has become a
Grill low to the ground, like a bull when it's runnin'
My Lamborghini is hummin', it sings a tune to your woman
So if you make me slow down, I'm peelin' off wit'cha onion
You need to stop all the frontin' under your hood there ain't nothin'
You know the exit is 13, come see if I'm bluffin'

[Chorus]

Uh!

Exactly! when we in the car we 22'd up
When we in the big truck we 24'd up, y'knahmean?
When you see me ridin', real fast, your job, is to stay back
Pre-bumper, behind the bumper fam! alright?
Do not race in front of me
I should not be able to see, your license plate
That means there's somethin' wrong here

This is the biggest decision I ever made in my life
You do a hundred miles an hour on the highway at night
You go to fasten your seat belt and make sure that it's tight
Because I'm rippin' the paws just like I'm rippin' the mic
Baby I'm pushin' the limits as if I'm racin' a bike
Tell the highway patrol no need to chase me tonight
The way I'm doin' my thang it's like I'm up in a plane
I hit the stick in the rain, I guess I'm sick in the brain
Rocks hittin' the frame, you think the shit is a game
But I'm ready for anybody that steps in my lane
And I know you afraid, no reason to be ashamed
Nobody's crashin' my party I'm mashin' out on these lames
I devoured the cowards and there is no doubt about it
All these niggaz are too gassed, they can't run without it
Tried to give me a flat tire, I wouldn't allow it
I left y'all in the dust nigga, I'm too high-powered!

[Chorus]

Exactly! when you see us, fast lane middle lane slow lane
It's all the same thing y'knahmean? we go fast
We got a lot of big wheels on our cars, it's what we do
Aight? when you see us, you salute the kingpins, the generals
That's us, y'knahmean?
And matter of fact, we gon' jump off the bridge right now
When you see l, this joint's in fuckin' effect!
I've been dyin' to say that!
I've been dyin' to say that, eighty-six nigga!
You know what it is man, first album
Ten million, no fuckin video, yo ll was there!
I warn you! you gotta stop!
There's too many questions and not enough answers
Too many questions, mind your business knahmean?
This is grown shit right here, aight?
When you see us, we do this for a living
I've been doin' this for a fuckin' minute!

I'm, Sicker then using period blood for war paint
Fans rush the stage, Then half these ladies
Got fucked, Got dressed, And left with bastard babies (Dada)
These days, I never chase women.
'Cause that's like playing rock paper sisscors, Limbless.
No use, And that's an easy mistake.
I treat a rapper like a habbit, Both easy to break.
I say, take one look, Your dealing with a heavy weight
Suffas got a bed, But I gotta bitch in every state.
Strap the latex, I'm the pin prick between safe sex
And having to take and aids test.
I can say CDub is holding them back.
The only thing holding them back is being overly whack
Hey!, Messing with the oars of funk
You get get crushed like you gave big pun the top bunk

It's nothing but oars and their mates and they may take it all

Funkoars,"Introduction â?? Trials
We have a whole lot of superstars on this stage here tonight,
And I want you to know one thing, this isâ?¦

Verse 1 â?? Suffa
Hilltop, that's where the blood runs,
Thick, it's where kings bury there loved ones,
Sick, kids guard their crop with a slug gun,
From rips, move like Schapelle on a drug run,
So quick, there's kids in the park waiting,
These are my poison diaries like Mark Latham,
So start hating, though you know in your heart,
We've been owning this art since our flow in the park.

Verse 2 â?? Mortar
You can't serve me like Serena and Venus,
Comparatively I leave you looking like the machinist,
Cats know they've been hit, when I spike the mic level,
And draw blood like intravenous,
Without a pencil I'm hell bent,
Leave dents in the condenser, you can tell when,
Mortar's been in the booth to rhyme,
I don't scratch vinyl, I scratch up the mic with my canines.

Verse 3 â?? Trials and Sesta
Mr Trials, young ladies jump in the sack,
I never kiss and tell instead I fuck it and brag,
I'm an angry drunk when I'm grabbing a rum,
And skull shots till we fall from grace like Eric Clapton's son,
South of the country, west of the city,
Chip into that kitty if we're going to be drinking until the skank pretty,
Will he attack? When he snap, got the track like,
Bring it back, hear him rap? Isn't that Funkoars?
You can find us staggered in a cipher,
Turning human traffic to a five car pile up,
We leave them all for dead,
I used to think big till it killed L, Pun, Smalls and Kev,
Like bad move, got you looking like you're eavesdropping the devil,
And T set the theme to send them to hell,
Bet on it, you're never better, I tell them again,
Seddy bury every adversary he put against.

Verse 4 â?? Hau
Fresh off the boat with an impressive approach,
To writing rhymes like pressing your throat,
The unquestionable dopeness, and oh yes,
It's the one and only, in the house like the gun is on me
Got you gronks saying blimey he's clever,
He's brighter than that sun in the shiniest of weather,
Girls you want diamonds forever?
Well throw your hymens the sky if you feel the vibe.

Verse 5 â?? Drapht
None of gravities properties are on top of me,
Can't hold me back from taking a stab like Chopper Read,
Can't hold me back, I'm back around again like stalkers,
My mic holds a force like a sword or a tomahawk,
To Conan, walking with no man now,
'cause you freeze when you spit like a snow mans mouth,
Arouse with every word, first you've got to know this,
We don't belong together like Rove and showbiz.

Chorus
And we what? â?? Run with crew,
Whose what? â?? Blood is blue,
Through life's â?? Fucking zoo,
And we might â?? Come for you,
And we what? â?? Run with crew,
Whose what? â?? Blood is blue,
Through life's â?? Fucking zoo,
And we might â?? Come for you.

Verse 6 â?? Vents
The saga begin, RPM drama again,
My lung burn, dangerous carcinogen,
Starving like Stalin in parliament in Prague again,
In camouflage targeting,
In Rock Creek Park, carve terror in the bark,
Blueprint, build pyramids in the dark,
The blood run deep, renegade creep,
Hilltop connect bro, centigrade heat.

Verse 7 â?? Muphin and Pegz
Muph, some give me shit for my name,
But I don't give a shit about you shit for brains,
Been a long while so I know the game,
It's more about music than your clothing range,
We're here to overtake, setting the standard,
Obese crew, we're the devilish family,
Stand on stage accepting a Grammy,
For the most incredible rapping since edible panties,
Unforgettable pansies in a flickering fit,
Knickers in a twist in a spiral of shit,
Undeniable gift with decipherable spits,
My fireball pit will burn you Muppets,
True rugged, blue blooded dignitary,
Crews love it when we do something visionary,
Move up never lose touch, living ready,
This is the hard road cargo hitting heavy.

Verse 8 â?? Robby Balboa
Robby Balboa bless the text,
Deliver you ticket to death,
Rivers of rhythm ripping the flesh,
Triple your bets on the primitive pest,
Selling sick smut from the cinema steps,
It begins with a breath, a kid killing his pets,
Just sitting in debt when I'm feeling a wreck,
Life's a bitch and so we're wringing her neck,
Fuck a metro in a pink shirt 'cause we're kicking the set.

Verse 9 â?? Honz
The Funkoars and the Hilltop, yes, we still rocking it,
And I ain't going near your bill unless we fucking topping it,
I drink till I'm all over the shop like barcodes,
And as far as rap goes, I've mastered my flows,
Certified and we back again to wreak havoc,
With these pads and pens so understand my friend,
We about to take over just like Hove spit it,
To the most gifted get them glasses up and toast with us.

Verse 10 â?? Pressure
Pressure MC, born with a mechanical mind,
The talent of rhyme, instinctual like animal kind,
Now I flow with the best, from east coast to the west,
We live in the flesh like my raps sewn in your chest,
You can't fathom the dopest flow, amateurs don't you know,
What ever happened to a good old fashioned broken nose?
Don't become a casualty of my faculty,
Damn I got spine but you'll never see the back of me.

Chorus
And we what? â?? Run with crew,
Whose what? â?? Blood is blue,
Through life's â?? Fucking zoo,
And we might â?? Come for you,
And we what? â?? Run with crew,
Whose what? â?? Blood is blue,
Through life's â?? Fucking zoo,
And we might â?? Come for you.

Aprendete mi lirica mas tirable como el Broni
Alimenticio como el cereal del tigre Tony

Abre los ojos why averigua por ti mismo que al que daran por muerto ha subido del avismo
Todo sucede siempre aunque muchos no quieran
Regreso como el zorro cuando menos se lo esperan, OK!!

[Chorus 2x]

Yo lyrical traqui trac, no traten de engañar al mundo
why diciendo mil palabras por segundo
Porque no tiene sentido porque su contenido no es veral tratan de hacer
Algo especial pero terminan igual
Repeticiones muchos dan consejos pero no dan soluciones
Se obuscan de la fama para obtener posiciones
Buscando reacciones personatico pero con ese estilo
El fracaso esta automatico, maniatico rebelde why mas clemente de inocentes
Si quieres ser diferente no te quites mas lo delincuente
Porque ya es hora de que busques otra tactica
Pues tienes el talento pero te falta mucha practica
Ay va el regreso con el verdadero flow pues aquel que habbia muerto
Pues regresa con el muy largo YO!
why uno arrancando la semilla que no crese
why poniendo en su lugar la que no carece

Frittirta el rapero llego el trero te di un HIP-HOP PAPA EL ESH SHU PAPA
El que returtalo junto furtalo demonstrandome como el aguila que yo vuelo
Contaminando con el virus de mi bula muchas filosofias pero si con la palabra
Creando como trueno que extremese

An surgido nuevos cantantes y nuevas modas

Pero el mundo sigue teniendo la misma escena

Alegrias pero tambien tristezas

Funky,"Esta es la bomba, para todos los rapers,
Traido por un verdadero hiphaper,
Sigo batallando con la espada en la mano
Trayendo sabidura para todos los hermanos
Tengo la regla para disciplinar
A los que cantan why no saben lo que puede pasar
Su tonta lirica inmadura why maliciociosa
Que no te hare crecer ni te habla de otra cosa
Antes de comer un huevo quitale la cascara
Antes de oir un cantante quitale la mascara
Por que ya son muchos raperos que estn maquillndose
Haciendo papel de lo que no son niquillandose
Estoy cansado de las mismas tonterias 
Eso si me tiras yo te tiro, si me miras te doy
Yo no tengo problemas por que sepan quien soy
Un creyente why para arriba voy por que es que voy
Existe el ignorante lleno de inseguridad 
Que cuando canta no lo hare con sinceridad
Con tal de alcanzar mucha popularidad
Desecha la humildad para sacar a la maldad
Pero comiendo de lo positivo me mantengo vivo
Por que soy valiente why agresivo
El que canta pornografia no es atrevido 
Por que es un tema que le agrada a todos los oidos
Asi que se heredo, te habla un veterano de la del spanish show
Esta cancin te hare mas de lo que hare el plow, 
Por que te afecta la conciencia why el corazon, zon... 

No te metas en terrenos donde necesitas una careta
Llamando la atencin , haber si alguien te respeta
Pero todo mundo sabe que son solo historietas
Historietas nada mas, son.

Funky Bunch,"Ah yeah huh..America the Beautiful
Huh, yeah, let me introduce y'all..to the Wildside

Annie was a high school cheerleader
Pom poms and bobby socks, no girl was sweeter
Come Prom time everybody was on the line
All the fellas swinging nickel and dime
Tales about love and lust and trust
But Annie took it all in stride
Cause deep inside Annie had aspirations
Wanted to be a chemical engineer
Making fifty to fifty-five thousand a year
Her first year of college was a success
But along came Billy possessed and obsessed
He took Annie on a fatal date
And showed her things that make heartbeats accelerate
Annie took a hit breathed two short breaths
One for life..the last for death
Now she's gone, a former Valedictorian
Ended up becoming a topic for historians
Washed up dreams and shattered pride
All because Annie took a hit - on the Wildside

Ron had enough of being broke everyday
Saying to himself, there's gotta be a better way
Cause 9 to 5 wasn't worth the headaches
So Ron figured out a faster way to make - money
Before you know it, he's a rich man
Gold on every finger of his hand
A brand new BMW, a condo, Ron ended up a John Doe
A body was found in the alley but never claimed
Full of bullet holes but none to blame
Ron became another victim of homicide
Because he chose to walk - on the Wildside

Charles had everything going for him
A top paying job, a good life, a good wife
A baby boy on the way any day
A gentleman attitude is all he displayed
Carol was the wife he loved and adored
Her family and friends treated him like an Ambassador
One night on the other side of town
A police dispatcher picked up a weird sound
Charles on the car phone asking for help
Claiming a burglar shot his wife and himself
His pregnant wife lay slumped over
Dreams corrupted and a young life over
Extensive searches throughout the projects
Put a lot of people through misery and wreck
Everyone a suspect 'til someone was found
Interrogated 'cause their skin was brown
Then there was Bennett, guilty until proven so
But soon as the case started moving slow
What do you know, sure as as sea gull gets webbed toed
Charles was the culprit
The whole plot was an insurance scam
Charles and his brother came up with a plan
Kill Carol, collect a big check
Blame it on a black man, what the heck?
And just before the story was known
Charles had a feeling that his cover was blown
So he jumped off a bridge
Committed suicide
This is how it is - on the Wildside

Little Tiffany, only thirteen
Came to the city, place of big dreams
Visiting family and friends for the summertime
Sittin' on a mailbox, watchin' the boys climb trees
And the girls play hopscotch
So far, her vacation was top notch
Then out of the blue, a Mercedes at top speed
Gang bangers chasin' the robbers on the stampede
Quick as a blink shots rang out loud
And a hail of bullets zipped through the crowd
One hit Tiffany, and instantly she died
Innocently - on the Wildside",Wildside,1995

Come and take your chance, let's move it up and down 
Go out and dance, move all over the town

Would I still see suspicion in your eyes?
Here we go again
Asking where I've been
You can't see these tears are real
I'm crying
We can't go on together
With suspicious minds
And be can't build our dreams
On suspicious minds

Oh let our love survive
Or dry the tears from your eyes
Let's don't let a good thing die

I've never lied to you

A strange kind of woman
The kind that gets written down in history
Her name was Nancy
Her face was nothing fancy
She left a trail of happiness and misery

Everybody loved her
She loved everyone and gave them good return
I tried to take her
I even tried to break her

I couldn't get her
But things got better, she said
Saturday nights from now on baby you're my star

She finally said she loved me

Funkytown Pros," 

You seem hungry--time for your four basic food groups
Understand the knowledge, wisdom, plus the damn truth
Trapped on the realm bald, the object is survivin'
Your realistical leads, day by day I'm dyin'
Say I was gone, but rhymin', I didn't do 'em
Make sure the coffin is closed, 'cause I be cryin' embalmin' fluid
No way it can be, K Born had it planned, see
Funkytown will take over the whole damn Planet E
The mic's my life, savor the rhymes I write
Favor no one, I guess I'm the only one who gave you
Lyrics to keep you full, keep your bull
I ain't lyin' or strivin' to pull
Givin' up because to shut the commercial suckers up
Second too late, reckon you hate quarrelin'
I'm on tomorrow, man, it's all night, hell up in Harlem
And you'll sleep forever, bless you I may
Flip the damn down lever 'cause you're full of sin
No repentance, your sentenced to eternity
I'll keep flamin' 'til you scream, ""Stop burnin' me!""
I serve your heart, Dev will play his part
And, yo, def do us part

""The path we have chosen is full of hazards...and one path we shall never
choose...the path of surrender.""

""Funkytown Foundry: Boiwundah, Devastatin', K Born, Freestyle
Manslaughter, H2, and Eternity.""

We can become managers, walkin' through your ear canal
When Dev plays your drum, yo, I chill a while
Back on a mission, you seem to be all reconditioned
But as I climb your cerebrum, it looks like there's somethin' missin'
We gotta fix that--Dev, hand me a track
Don't get scared, when we take notes, we'll put it back
Oh, my gosh--you were brainwashed to act wack
Thanks to Funkytown now you're programmed to act Black
Save me old label tips, I won't play back on table rims
Reincarnate what was really rippled and words from my lips
Not a letter, more edit, I read it, I said it, forget it
No use of the brain, such a shame, you should be beheaded
Laughin' at those who hated my rhymes for being so complicated
Scientists are ionized, they don't believe we originated
When I'm deceased, I make sure you remember me
Dipped in gold label as a statue of Black liberty
Rap warrior who didn't leave his life alone
A beat, a style, and a microphone
Hip-hop: the art, and I play it smart
And, yo, def do us part",Def Do Us Part,1991

S-Type Jag straight off the lot, believe me dog I'm really hot

'Cause I wear a Roley, that look like a snowman
And I push a Jag, you just gotta see it man
I'm sitting on Dubs, kinda like a blank tape
You see them rocks in my teeth, ain't none of em fake
Give me a break, you think I'm lying or something
I'm at the mall with your hoe, and she buying me something
I'm a young pimp, with a whole lot of cash
And why'all haters, why'all can kiss our ass

[Chorus: Repeat 2X]

I got too much M-O-N-E-why
Anything I S-E-E, I be	-you-why
Pull a Bentley off the lot, and ran that thang in the wall
We throw Crys in the air laugh, and watch it fall
Watch me ball, as the Dub spin like a top
I got crunk when I stopped, and made my pop trunk wop
Girls bop, automatic cause I'm top of the line
I cut my beep past six, and I raise the top of your spine
I'ma shine, Sucka Free, Boss Hogg in a row
You can catch me fresh and braided, or rugged and fro
You see the Spre's on the car, I bet you my people like the rock
When girls see Tite, Flip and Slim they say... pulling cameras out
Damn I'm hot, when I hit the club I'm bound to line to the bar
And for the first hundred people, I'm insuring they car
Attracting your star, cause nigga my piece attracting your car

Füredi Nikolett,"The snow glows white on the mountain tonight
Not a footprint to be seen
A kingdom of isolation
And it looks like I'm the queen

The wind is howling like this swirling storm inside
Couldn't keep it in, heaven knows I've tried
Don't let them in, don't let them see
Be the good girl you always have to be
Conceal, don't feel, don't let them know
Well, now they know

Let it go, let it go
Can't hold it back anymore
Let it go, let it go
Turn away and slam the door
I don't care what they're going to say
Let the storm rage on
The cold never bothered me anyway

It's funny how some distance makes everything seem small
And the fears that once controlled me can't get to me at all
It's time to see what I can do
To test the limits and break through
No right, no wrong, no rules for me
I'm free

Let it go, let it go
I am one with the wind and sky
Let it go, let it go
You'll never see me cry
Here I stand and here I stay
Let the storm rage on

My power flurries through the air into the ground
My soul is spiraling in frozen fractals all around
And one thought crystallizes like an icy blast
I'm never going back, the past is in the past

Let it go, let it go
When I rise like the break of dawn
Let it go, let it go
That perfect girl is gone
Here I stand in the light of day
Let the storm rage on
The cold never bothered me anyway",Let It Go [From Frozen/Multi Language Medley],2014

Como a veinte mil metros de altura

Por la suerte cai entre los brazos
De una linda y hermosa creatura.

Y corriendo esconder me llevo
Me colmo todo el cuerpo de besos
Y abrazada, conmigo lloro
Preguntaba que yo le dijiera
Que persona de alla me avento

No le pude decir nada, nada
Solamente pense en la maldad
Me subi hasta la nube mas alta
Y tirarme a matar de verdad
Y olvidar a una ingrata perfura

I've seen mothers and their daughters cry

Surprised soldiers with holes in their heads
Smiling presidents sweating in their beds
Dreaming of the land where the black gold flows
Where the sun always shines and the desert wind blows

It's always one step forward and two steps back
They stumble and fall and break their necks
In the land of the killing fountains

Once it was God's land in the middle-ages
Now blue helmets try to stop the rage
While rocket launchers burn the sand
That's what you call the promised land

It's always one step forward and two steps back
They stumble and fall and break their necks
In the land of the killing fountains

You can kill bodies but you can't kill religion
This is the truth and peace is the fiction

Seven days a week and the years pass by

Where the black gold flows, where the desert wind blows

Fury in the Slaughterhouse,"You must remember this, a kiss is just a kiss,
A sigh is just a sigh,
The fundamental things apply, as time goes by
And when two lovers woo, they still say ""I love you"",
On that you can rely,
No matter what the future brings, as time goes by

Moonlight and love songs, never out of date,
Hearts full of passion, jealousy and hate,
Woman needs man, and man must have his mate,
There's no one can deny

It's still the same old story, a fight for love and glory,
A case of do or die,
The world will always welcome lovers, as time goes by

What a wonderfull place to read a book 'bout love
What a wonderfull place to sit around with me under a tree
On an afternoon in the cemetery

Millions of flies spiral around a cross before they land
In a fresh grave someone dug last night
The little chappel looks so sad even the flowers seem to cry
And all those people seem to wait for the moment they will die

Provoke emotions when I'm boasting and bragging
Just imagine gun clappin' linguistic assassin
Bout to shake the world up, slam it to the floor up
You heard of us, real niggas we blow the world up
Rip off the planet, take it for granted when I manage
With that home team advantage, automatic rhyme bandit
Bout to hand it, cause you cram to understand it
When I land it open handed
I'm a transatlantic slave, with that old black magic
Got to have it from the demo, to the master
Some brothers try to strike, but light the fire of disaster
I'm the chainsaw massacre, brain ball acid dust
Down shift, pump your brakes, ease off the clutch
We fuck it up, when we conduct, load your pistol up
Put this verbal dick in your mouth, until I bust a nut
And let this jam tell you who the fuck I am

Ain't nothing to it, I keep the word play fluent
And tone will run through like the emperor Jones
Now the inventor of poems and lymrics outstanding pitch
Regardless if your feeling my shit
Yo, I stay prime and plus I'm never outdated
In time I break atoms from the way that I rhyme
Now I created a line with no miscues, fake no moves
So here's the rhyme I couldn't wait to use
I represent, and put the pressure on your local event
And drop heavy when the vocal commits
To hit you with the hits, from the colonial prince

Its all I want to do, for life
Keeping it real until the day I die
I stay funkish in my way
Continue to mash and don't forget to pray
I keep my hand on my steel
Because I love my life and I always will
Whatever people say to me
I take it in stride I'm thinking negro league
If you really don't know me
Then you best back up, I suggest strongly

You don't want to be standing next to me
Before my final curtain call
My mistakes they really won't be long
If we bump this in the streets
Or even at some party
You niggas really can't see me
My request is that you stop trying
Before I let go

[Chorus: x2]

Everyday, the 45 stays I'm jacking forever
I busting taking now bowing down never
Gotta watch my back for these coppers
As well as the niggas that I kick it with
They stick you faster than these bitches will
Since I'm pimping everybody wants my riches
And I can't keep my god for buying weed acting every time
I smoke constantly and can't flinch me
From committing the murders so I chill and puff the herb
Who gots my back nobody
If little giant gaudy laying niggas down at the homey's party
Always be goin crazy I guess we are being who we are
Really say the nigga gotta be a star
I gots to get mine and if I'm blasting its my destiny
If I die then it was meant to be intentionally
Worry stressing no guessing your profession
When the murder take place set yourself a tech 9

Then I hop in Margiela then hop in some Bape

Peep all these diamonds they jump out the face
Ducking them diamonds and selling this white
Got to watch for these niggas they'll jump on your case

And none of this money don't come out the safe
Fuck with my dog and knock a chunk out ya face[?]
Nigga I be so high I could jump out to space
What the fuck did I say?

I be so fly I just done shoot down my cape
and bought me a safe and it came with a wraith
Got some new money went and bought me a K
You see all them VV's jump out the face
Put that dope in the trap and cook up me a cake

Pour up some pour up my nigga we boolin'

Watching my stacks and my shoes

We was on Jimmy Choos
2012 when we did the Giuseppes, Margielas was cool
When you lil' niggas was worried about Jordans we was rocking them Loubs
If I got to lose its not by the rules
Get hit with that chopper knock right out your shoes
Shawty so proper she look like a goddess
When I dip inside her the shit like a pool
I bought some Rarris and I bought some Phantoms
And then dropped the ceilings like I dropped out of school
Still will pull up on you hop out with goons
Thirty-two shots let it pop out the tool

Tats all over my body
Gettin' real money, niggas still hatin' on me
Man y'all need a new hobby
Or they won't talk to me, what they gon' say?
I ball, you a waterboy, Bobby Boucher
On top, toupée, y'all niggas fruitcakes
I don't really play games but I keep 2 K's
Damn, Mr. Hood why you do 'em like that?
Pull up in the drop with the ceiling top back
Couple weeks old, ""Bugatti"" done went gold
You ain't even know, I deserve that plaque
We the best, runnin' every summer in fact
July 16th I'm bringin' the real back
Broward! Pussy

(This the remix!) I woke up in a new Bugatti

Ho' hold up, double M back in this bitch
Walk in the club with a MAC on my hip
Diamonds look like niggas snappin' a flick
Ballin' I blow fifty racks in the VIP
I back in the whip, Maybach with your bitch
A new Mussolini in back of the six
I'm shittin' on rappers, these rappers is sick
Cause my homies got whips that these rappers ain't get
Cause we crackin' them bricks and I package the zip
And I'm switchin' my flow, I spit crack in this bitch
And I been hit your ho, now she back on my dick
But I get to the dough and get back at your bitch
Like hollup, I woke up in Coon new Ferrari
With all my motherfuckin' jewelry on me
New Aston Martin plus a Rolls Royce
And a new Ferrari, that's a new Bugatti (I woke up in a new Bugatti (Remix!))

I woke up in a new Bugatti (Remix!)

Got racks, stack 'em up like Lego nigga
I'm a motherfuckin' G, I don't play with no nigga
Multi-millionaire self-made ho nigga
H-U-S-T-L-E gang
For that, in God we trust, we bang
I'm the new John Gotti in a new Bugatti
I got a few young hotties wanna get shit poppin'
Right, put it in the light
Nigga got ice but it don't look right
If a nigga buy a brick and it don't cook right
I'll whip that shit for a rack, sit tight
I got a bag full of tools and some yay to move
And all I want is money, leave the fame to you
I graduated out of gladiator school
So all I know is go like I'm trained to do (Turn up!)
Right now, turn my Mazy pedal to the metal I'm ashin' out
I let the top down in my Phantom drop
Blowin', I'm high as an astronaut
When you see me, I'm cashin' out
Walked into Mercedes bought half the lot
You keep carrying on, you getting carried out
Cause I don’t take ass whoopins, just pass ‘em out
Is this worth getting blasted about?
No forreal, is it worth getting blasted about?

Money conversation
Get so high, I be scrapin'
Got my eyes like a Asian
In my ride, like I'm racin'
In the sky, like a plane
It's Gang or die
Ain't no lames up in my circle
Ain't no ho shit in my eyes
Throwin' money in the air
Poppin' bands and let it fly
Where I'm from, you come up short
Pull that thing and let it fly
You know me, blow so much dank, think I'm Marley
Got so much ink on my body
Brought so much drink to the party
I fell asleep and woke up in a new Bugatti (Remix!)

I woke up in a new Bugatti (Remix!)
I woke up in a new Bugatti

Fresh, whips
Candy on that money dip
Five hundred, I'm hood rich
Put in work, did a hundred flips
Been about them mansions
Stunna island, we packin'
Rich gang, we uptown
Nigga hardbody and mackin'
Tool on that back, nigga
Money and that power
Mansion on that beach, nigga

Blow a mil' like it's a dollar

Take my spot nigga never will
Now I know how 'melo feel
We both shooters from New York
But I shown nigga how the metal feel
Fidel Castro with them cuban links
With Mark Cuban where them Cubans link
Excuse My French nigga, no France
Hottest new niggas in ten years
Coke boy deal like ten M's
DJ Khaled up in there (I woke up in a new Bugatti!)

Flow hot as the Mojave, gimme that sloppy shit
All on my car stick, give her some hundreds she did
Like this, I'mma say this (I'mma say this)
Fuck it, I'll say it (Fuck it, I'll say it)
If you got good pussy you should always have your rent paid
Choke on some bands if I'm not mistaken
Edit up my outfit, fashion statement
This the school of hard knocks, graduation

I'm sick of y'all niggas all talkin' crazy
Hottest nigga spittin' and they can't debate it
I didn't really know 2Pac or Big
But know the beast within'll reincarnate 'em
Fuck underrated, I'm constipated
I'm shittin' on 'em, fuck toilet paper
You're now tuned into the fuckin' greatest
Ace Hood, congratulations
Say name one nigga that's rockin' with him
Flow like a hundred round choppa nigga
Made a way out of the jungle

Recently flooded my neck and my wrist

Tell niggas nigga never did exist
You niggas never ever been a threat
These niggas never get enough attention
I just put the bitch on punishment
I've been hangin' where the money been
I don't know what type of love is this
Can you tell me where my dogs at?
Put a hollow in your ball cap
What type of nigga you call that?

You my main fling, I took it main stream
Everyday its nice to share our main dreams, and ain't a damn thing

Like ta-da, voila, Gucci, Louie, Stravers, Prada

Fishtailing out the parking lot leaving Magic
Two bad bitches and I got 'em out of Magic
The way I made it work, disappear, call it magic
Sipping on the Purple and the Yellow, drinking Magic
Voila, magic, voila, magic, voila, magic, voila, magic
Fishtailing out the parking lot leaving magic
Sipping on the Purple and Yellow, drinking Magic

On my way to Aspen, I forgot to do my taxes
Call up my accountant, he gon' make it do magic
Had to get a driver just to drop me at the airport
Way I smoked the Blunts man I burned 'em up like Newport
Fifty thousand dollars on superstar attire
K.E. and Young Future bringing them fire
All this damn cash make a bitch wanna retire
Gotta drop a half a brick you wanna put me on a flyer
Excuse me but my lingo crazy
See these diamonds ain't none of 'em fugazi
Two bad bitches wanna fuck me the greatest
AOG in a brand new Mercedes
Turn out the lot I'mma do a 180
For the haters I'mma go ahead do it 360
Drinking on a Sprite got Lean all in it
I'm a astronaut nigga better trust my pimping

Fishtailing out the parking lot leaving Magic
Two bad bitches and I got 'em out of Magic
The way I made it work, disappear, call it magic

Billionaire boy that's true inspiration
Learn to astronaut kid no such thing as limitation
Flying down 20 in the motherfucking spaceship
Just left Magic in the motherfucking basement
Two bitches trailing in a Beemer out of Germany
Got a thing for me, don't want a thing from me
They like my energy, not my Embassy
I know tricks like Criss Angel
I don't trick but I could make you famous
You could disappear from your past life
You'll reappear, no outta sight
I'm Pluto talking, to Jimmy walking, when you walking
I used to be fly but now I'm hawking
I rose on Earth and now I'm satisfied, while I
I stay high, my bitches on they high horse
I double back like two cups
And pull out in that new Porsche

Say you wanna go to Pluto, me and you, we are the same

Future,"No longer can I remain earthbound
The future is now
Time and space are one in the same

Enough time in space and we running the game
Almost is unacceptable
The cosmos is a receptacle
For the spectacle of my ascension

Inhabiting multiple dimensions of perspective
All my actions selective
At all costs, I must obtain the objective
Regain the inception intended at the conception

A living lethal weapon
I'm the natural selection
Moving in my own eccentric orbit
A rebel amongst conformists

So far gone, you might catch me on Pluto
Four billion miles away
Do a whole week in one day
Live for keeping it real

I'll make you believe, all my thoughts free
Privet in a large coat
This ain't no shit that I wrote
I've been down this road before
And I've been on the rollercoast'
So many ups and downs and turns
Homies droppin' like flies
Full strapped forty times
Doin' it like send the city guy
While I'm on the road, doin' shows, takin' this ride

I know the kingpin's on, the name is Legendary
They smoke crack right now, this ain't a Tyler Perry
This be real about real life, it's very necessary
For me to go on in, so I went back in
Try to stay in this booth and never come out again

Go to New York with this girl and I come back with a lip
Break bread with my team
Partner money here, here
I ain't cut for this, I want my music global
I'm gonna see people bump their fist
I'm gonna change a nigga life
So he ain't gotta go through this
Don't get caught in my fit
Till I'm runnin' one o six 
They tracked me 'cross the globe
You can have the fame
Just give me my soul
I could scratch these niggas and go back in that boat
