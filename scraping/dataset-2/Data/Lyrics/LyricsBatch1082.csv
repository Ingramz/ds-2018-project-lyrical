Teddy Kotick,"I've got you under my skin.
I've got you deep in the heart of me.
So deep in my heart that you're really a part of me.
I've got you under my skin.
I'd tried so not to give in.
I said to myself, this affair never will go so well.
But why should I try to resist when, baby, I know down well
I've got you under my skin?

I'd sacrifice anything come what might
For the sake of havin' you near
In spite of a warnin' voice that comes in the night
And repeats, repeats in my ear,
Don't you know, you fool, you never can win?
Use your mentality, wake up to reality.
But each time that I do just the thought of you
Makes me stop before I begin
Cause I've got you under my skin.

I would sacrifice anything come what might
For the sake of havin' you near
In spite of the warning voice that comes in the night
And repeats, how it yells in my ear,
Don't you know, you fool, ain't no chance to win
Why not use your mentality, get up, wake up to reality?
And each time I do just the thought of you
Makes me stop just before I begin
Cause I've got you under my skin.
And I like you under my skin.",I've Got You Under My Skin,2012
Teddy Kotick,"Say, it's only a paper moon
Sailing over a cardboard sea
But it wouldn't be make-believe
If you believed in me

Yes, it's only a canvas sky
Hanging over a muslin tree
But it wouldn't be make-believe
If you believed in me

Without your love
It's a honky tonk parade
Without your love
It's a melody played in a penny arcade

It's a Barnum and Bailey world
Just as phony as it can be
But it wouldn't be make-believe
If you believed in me

Say, it's only a paper moon
Sailing over a cardboard sea
But it wouldn't be make-believe
If you believed in me

Yes, it's only a canvas sky
Hanging over a muslin tree
But it wouldn't be make-believe
If you believed in me

Without your love
It's a honky-tonk parade
Without your love
It's a melody played in a penny arcade

It's a Barnum and Bailey world
Just as phony as it can be
But it wouldn't be make-believe
If you believed in me

It's phony it's plain to see
How happy I would be
If you believed in me",Its Only a Paper Moon,2012

Yes I ask you very confidentially, ain't she sweet?
Ain't she nice? Look her over once or twice.
Yes I ask you very confidentially, ain't she nice?
Just cast an eye in her direction, oh me oh my, ain't that perfection?
Oh I repeat, well, don't you think that's kinda neat?

Teddy Lee Orchestra,"When they begin the beguine
It brings back the sound of music so tender
It brings back a night of tropical splendor
It brings back a memory ever green

I'm with you once more under the stars
And down by the shore an orchestra's playing
And even the palms seem to be swaying
When they begin the beguine

To live it again is past all endeavor
Except when that tune clutches my heart
And there we are, swearing to love forever
And promising never, never to part

What moments divine, what rapture serene
Till clouds came along to disperse the joys we had tasted
And now when I hear people curse the chance that was wasted
I know but too well what they mean

So don't let them begin the beguine
Let the love that was once a fire remain an ember
Let it sleep like the dead desire I only remember
When they begin the beguine

Oh yes, let them begin the beguine, please make them play
Till the stars that were there before return above you
Till you whisper to me once more, ""Darling, I love you""
Then we suddenly know what heaven we're in
When they begin the, begin the, begin the beguine

When they begin the, begin the, begin the beguine
When they begin the beguine",Begin the Beguine,2007
Teddy Mac,"You make me feel so young
You make me feel though spring has sprung
And every time I see you grin
I'm such a happy individual

The moment that you speak
I wanna go play hide-and-seek
I wanna go and bounce that moon
Just like a toy balloon

You and I, we are just like a couple of tots
Running across the meadow
Picking up lots of forget-me-nots

You make me feel so young
You make me feel there are songs to be sung
Bells to be rung and a wonderful fling to be flung

And even when I'm old and gray
I wanna feel the way I do today
'Cause you make me feel so young

You make me feel so young
You make me feel so spring has sprung
And every time I see you grin

Teddy Martin,"Les gens qui voient de travers
Pensent que les bancs verts
Qu'on voit sur les trottoirs
Sont faits pour les impotents ou les ventripotents
Mais c'est une absurdité
Car à la vérité
Ils sont là c'est notoire
Pour accueillir quelque temps les amours débutants

Bancs publics, bancs publics
En s'disant des ""je t'aime"" pathétiques
Ont des petites gueules bien sympathiques

Ils se tiennent par la main
Parlent du lendemain
Du papier bleu d'azur
Que revêtiront les murs de leur chambre à coucher
Ils se voient déjà doucement
Elle cousant, lui fumant
Dans un bien-être sûr
Et choisissent les prénoms de leur premier bébé

Croise sur son chemin
Deux de ces malappris
Elle leur décoche hardiment des propos venimeux

Quand seront apaisés
Leurs beaux rêves flambants
Quand leur ciel se couvrira de gros nuages lourds
Ils s'apercevront émus
Qu'c'est au hasard des rues
Sur un d'ces fameux bancs
Qu'ils ont vécu le meilleur morceau de leur amour

Hey, baby, give me a reason so I can touch it how I want to (touch it how I want to)
And make love to you how them other lame niggas want to
Go on, girl, what you gon' do?
On my nappy head you can pull my nappy dreads if you want to
Shawty, I'm a put it on you
And make you think that you the girl that I be singing all my songs to
You got me thinking that me and you went to drinkin'
When you sippin' that Patron we been and got it on, boo
But for now we just sit and chill
You never had love making like this for real
Come on, baby, you just appeal
Now take it slow, let me take it down low, let's go, let's go
So you know it's about to go down now (go down now)
Speed it up, baby, can't slow down now (slow down now)
Tell ya closet freak she can come out now (come out now)
Why you think they call me Teddy Penderazdoun?

[Chorus:]
And now I know 
You didn't expect me to go low
Now you know
From the top to bottom, now that I got you
I'm a stick, stick, stick, stick, stick, oh
I'm a stick, stick, stick, stick, stick, oh

You got a nigga all swole like a T-pain show in Tallahassee
Never put that ass on hold, I'm to nasty
Don't ever underestimated T-pain
You should have known when I was biting on you belly button chain
That you are about to receive some of that good tongue
Tryin' tell me not to do like you don't want none
Tryin' to sit up in the bed, tryin' to act all calm
Acting like it ain't good, tryin' to hold that cum
But you know that I'm the best, you know your Teddy Verset
It's the first ten minutes, you ain't felt shit yet
I got the whips, I got the chain, I got the handcuffs, too
But ain't none of that for me; I'm about to handcuffs you
That's the freaky shit; I keep on skeeting shit and leaving leaky shit
I take her ass back to the church, a preacher and deacon shit
I'm beating it; let's try computer love, I keep deleting it
I'm fucking under the dresser, the bedroom floor, and the sheets and shit

[Chorus]

What you doing?
Take ya pants off
Not that fast; do it slower
You gon' kill... ruin the mood
Move ya hand, let me see

Baby girl, let a nigga slide in them guts
My little man wanna hide them guts
I'm a take my time with them guts
And, baby girl, when I'm in them guts
You ain't gotta worry bout ya man 'cause
I bet he can't do it like me (nope, nope)
I bet he can't do it like me (nope, nope)

And now I know 
You didn't expect me to go low
Now you know
From the top to bottom, now that I got you

Teddy Pendergrass,"I know that we both talked it over and said that it's best to forget
And we'll leave all our mem'ries behind us, it's better ended and yet
So sad the song of two empty lives when that moment of truth suddenly arrives

Together, we belong together.  
Never was that one lovely word easier to say.
So sad the song of just remembering when knowing the love of your life 
Will never come again.

Ever on that you can rely.
So would it be wrong to give our love just one more try (my darlin')

And yet, so sad the song of what might have been
You see a lifetime of dreams scattered in the wind

Together, we belong together
And I'll love you for one lovely word easier to say.
So sad the song of just remembering when knowing the love of your life 
Will never come again.

Ever on that you can rely.
So would it be wrong to give our love just one more try (my darlin')
So sad the song that says goodbye.

Teddy Powell,"It all comes back to me now, 
A starry summer sky,
A laughing you and I, alone.
It all comes back to me now, 
A sea of midnight blue,
Your face uplifted to my own.

We called it a thrill of the moment, 
And blamed the moon up above,
We didn't know what the glow meant,
We never dreamed it might be love.
It all comes back to me now, 
The love I threw away,
And now each lonely night I pray, 
That it will all come back to me someday.",It All Comes Back to Me Now,2004
Teddy Powell & His Orchestra,"Blue moon you saw me standing alone
Without a dream in my heart
Without a love of my own
Blue moon, you knew just what I was there for
You heard me saying a prayer for 
Someone I really could care for
And then there suddenly appeared before me
The only one my arms will ever hold
I heard somebody whisper ""Please adore me""
And when I looked, the moon had turned to gold!
Blue moon! 
Now I'm no longer alone
Without a dream in my heart
Without a love of my own",Blue Moon,1999
Teddy Ralph & His Orchestra,"Stars shining bright above you
Night breezes seem to whisper ""I love you""
Birds singing in the sycamore tree

While I'm alone and blue as can be
Dream a little dream of me

Stars fading, but I linger on, dear
Still craving your kiss
I'm longing to linger till dawn, dear

Sweet dreams till sunbeams find you
Sweet dreams that leave all worries behind you
But in your dreams whatever they be

This is how it should be done

'Cause this style 
Is identical to none 
How can I make you dance some more 
That's what I came here for 

Feel your blue flows like water 
The man behind the music will make you jump 
Oh Jack you're swingin' 
Make you shake your rump 

No dick or fee tellin' me this is what you want 
Baselines and snares that will make you funk 
Intimidated by his 14 year old 
At 97 he's a different kind of funk 

We push together like a perfect hand and tongue 
You pressed your luck and now your back to should be sunk 
Be coming, free the future, with yo' face punked 
Forgot about the past now what you want 
Platinum tracks to put you on the map 

'Cause we gotta keep it in the fam' 
You had yo' chance to be down wit da man 
So busy playa hatin', perpetuating, articulating 
Balla's down four, you can't take me 

What the deal ma 
Funkey Mama plays the track so you could feel, huh? 
I'll make a D, I'm all about the dolla' bills y'all 
Rock the diamond Lex while I sit behind my desk 
And sign the checks 

If you like hits baby 
Got 'em going crazy on Blackstreet 
You know it's plaque time when me and the track meet 
Save all yo whack beats, QP and TR so precise with mics 
We should be surgeons in E.R. 

The block knows 
Baby girl be my diamond 'cause she rocks shows 
See my one's ain't no way that you can stop those 
Little man got your breath together 
With Queen Pen, now it's hot to death 

So take a look back 
What I did, what I'm doing, where I take this 
It's kinda simple 'cause it's nothing just to make hits 
Peep the facts, keep 'em stacked 
When the streets are Black 
Ladies scream he's the Mack 

'Cause I kick (what) 
Shit that make the fly chick you with my chick 
And plush funds just ridiculous 
'Cause I'm rich 
We are TR, you see, QP, that's we, Blackstreet, gone 

You can't take it 
(And now, here's the magnificent Funkey Mama) 

Now Teddy jam for me one time 
Enforce that then I'd make my hips bump and grind 
We'll just happen 
All this shit in this 'cause of platinum hits 
Little man be the shit, Funkey Mama represent 
It ain't never been no different 

And we got witnesses 
You account for all of this shit 
Just we, and get your block knocked off 
You can keep your I-pinion till you get there 

'Cause it don't matter 
We don't follow chit chatter 
We make hits 
And calls, my situations get thick 
Ask St. Nick, about the repertoire 
For those in the past, they know who they are 

If the shoe fits, trust 
We gon' wear it 
Can we be's the baddest clique up on this planet 
We paid the cost to be boss guys 
'Cause scare money don't win money, now drop it

Is identical to none

I love all these places, but there's no place like home
I love my city

I go hard in the city of London
I get a lot of love, all smiles when I step in the function
I'm a local boy, I'm from the east side
Now I'm jet settin', I'm reppin', I'll do it worldwide
When I was a kid there was a rough ride
Barely had the money for a bus ride, now I'm on the upside
Having a ball with all the breders I grew up with
A couple of women I'm in the club with
Bottle the bubbly, feeling lovely, women are hugging me
Nobody could tell me nothing and nobody can never trouble me
It's all good, pure positive vibes
For the most part everybody's just tryna live their lives
We're not afraid to die, only the strong survive
You don't know if you don't try, the stakes are high
And it's the city where I earned my crown
God knows that I love this town

The city lights are extra bright
They shine for us tonight
The streets are so alive right now
I fuckin' love this town
Let me buy you another round
And show you how my peeps get down
The streets are so alive right now
I fuckin' love this town

It's just one big melting pot
Every creed color and race, we got the lot
And I love to shop, there's not a brand that can't be copped
No more than a couple of stops
Where should I begin?
Might see me in the west side getting it in
Might see me on the north side getting a trim
South side of the river in a race car having a spin, I just win
And I'm never gonna lose with the city to guide me
Got the vibe of the city inside me and the streets are lively
Got a whole lot of love and I'm connect it
It's 7 million people behind me, don't try me
'Cause right now we're gonna rave it up
Set the roof on fire and blaze it up
And we're in it to win it
There's no limit so we raise it up
We got the dancefloor shaking like, woo

The city lights are extra bright
They shine for us tonight
The streets are so alive right now
I fuckin' love this town
Let me buy you another round
And show you how my peeps get down
The streets are so alive right now
I fuckin' love this town

I had a million things to say
We shared the moon in all it's splender
You pressed your lips to mine, and by the way
 
Did I remember to tell you I adore you
And I am living for you alone?
Did I remember to say ""I'm lost without you""
And just how mad about you I've grown?
You were in my arms and that was all I knew
We were alone, we two, what did I say to you?
Did I remember to tell you I adore you
And pray forever more you are mine?

Dadya, you swing it, so do I

She was with that Jackie White mama

With my hands around his throat mama

No matter how long I will always come back
There's a bond that we share, it will always be there
She may be holding but I love her for that

There are reasons that I'm out here so far
Blows are weaker from an ocean apart
And I guess I could run from my place in the sun
She wouldn't let me, and I love her for that

And, oh, you steal her
You love her and deceive her
She did nothing so wrong, so wrong

And the songs that are left to remind of the theft
She'll let you sing them, and I love her for that",Love Her for That,2000

In our private room, the color all runs out.
An' not a sound, the smoke curls in the air.

The candles burn and shadows loom.
I hide below it all,

Teddy Thompson,"Lyrics to Turning The Gun On Myself :
The morning is bright
As ?Rapper?s Delight?
Floats up to my room
From the street

And who would disturb
A slumbering world
With this late seventies beat?
I?m taking my aim
From this window pane
And I?m turning the gun on myself

The Upper West Side
Is supposed to be quiet
It?s supposed to be wealthy and dull
So how to explain
This thundering pain
That?s pushing its way through my skull

I?m taking a leave
Of my senses, you see
And I?m turning the gun on myself

New York is loud
It?s wonderfully loud
I wouldn?t live anywhere else
But I need my rest
To be at my best
Away from the high decibels

I?m losing my will
I?m shooting to kill
And I?m turning the gun on myself
I?m losing my will
And I?m shooting to kill
And I?m turning the gun on myself

I gotta hope that it's not too late

Was here in my own two hands

It's been a very short run I must object
You're not really gonna take it away just yet
I need ten more years to get to good
I just did what I thought I could get away with

Maybe it's good, maybe it's fine
Maybe I'll learn to walk the line

Never had much of a wild side to tame
But I grew up pretty tall and fine
I just wanted to have my time
Have some fun

Maybe I'll learn to walk the line

Give me one more chance to get things right
I wanna put it back the way it was overnight
But a change of ways seems a bit too much

Counts on Pfizer to erase our ills

One bad hand away from a losing game

I'm never happy but at least I get some peace
In this war but I could use more

It's the first ten minutes, you ain't felt shit yet
I got the whips, I got the chain, I got the handcuffs, too
But ain't none of that for me; I'm about to handcuffs you
That's the freaky shit; I keep on skeeting shit and leaving leaky shit

I think about the one and only
Who's bound to find me some golden day

The one I love is coming along some day
And I'll have none except the one I love
He/She may be near or ever so far away
But I'll have none except the one I love

And though our meeting is left to chance
Until our meeting 
I still will have my dream romance
And through the night I pray to the moon above
To please be kind and find the one I love",The One I Love (Belongs to Somebody Else),1956
Teddy Wilson,"Picture you upon my knee, 
Just tea for two and two for tea,
Just me for you
And you for me alone.

Nobody near us
To see us or hear us,
No friends or relations
On weekend vacations.
We won't have it known, dear,
That we own a telephone, dear; 

Day will break and you'll awake 
And start to bake a sugar cake, 
For me to take
For all the boys to see.

We will raise a family, 
A boy for you, a girl for me.
Oh, can't you see
How happy we would be?",Tea for Two,1956
Teddy Wilson,"When the mellow moon begins to beam,
Every night I dream a little dream,
And of course Prince Charming is the theme,
The he for me.
Although I realize as well as you
It is seldom that a dream comes true,
To me it's clear
That he'll appear.

Some day he'll come along,
The man I love
And he'll be big and strong,
The man I love
And when he comes my way
I'll do my best to make him stay.

He'll look at me and smile
I'll understand,
And in a little while,
He'll take my hand,
And though it seems absurd,
I know we both won't say a word

Maybe I shall meet him Sunday
Maybe Monday, maybe not,
Still I'm sure to meet him one day
Maybe Tuesday will be my good news day

He'll build a little home
Just meant for two,
From which I'll never roam,
Who would, would you?
And so all else above

And you care for me!",Who Cares,1957

Who tell you fate supplies a mate
It's all bananas

They're writing songs of love but not for me
A lucky star's above but not for me
With love to lead the way I've found more clouds of gray
Than any Russian play could guarantee

I was a fool to fall and get that way
Hi-ho, alas, and also lack-a-day
Although I can't dismiss the memory of his kiss
I guess he's not for me

You know I'm yours for just the taking

It brings back a night of tropical splendor
It brings back a memory ever green

And down by the shore an orchestra's playing
And even the palms seem to be swaying
When they begin the beguine

To live it again is past all endeavor
Except when that tune clutches my heart
And there we are, swearing to love forever
And promising never, never to part

What moments divine, what rapture serene
Till clouds came along to disperse the joys we had tasted
And now when I hear people curse the chance that was wasted
I know but too well what they mean

So don't let them begin the beguine
Let the love that was once a fire remain an ember
Let it sleep like the dead desire I only remember
When they begin the beguine

Oh yes, let them begin the beguine, please make them play
Till the stars that were there before return above you
Till you whisper to me once more, ""Darling, I love you""

A little room where all the roses bloom
I want to lead you into Nature's hall
Where ev'ry year the roses give a ball
They have an orchestra up in the trees
For their musicians are the birds and bees
And they will sing us a song
As we are strolling along
 
In sunny Roseland, where summer breezes are playing
Where the honey bees are ""A-Maying""
There all the roses are swaying
Dancing while the meadow brook flows
The moon when shining is more than ever designing
For 'tis ever then I am pining
Pining to be sweetly reclining
Somewhere in Roseland
Beside a beautiful rose
 
The ball is over and tulips meet
Their little kisses are so short and sweet
The lilies nod to the forget-me-nots
When they're departing in their flower pots
But all the roses with their spirits high
Remain to love until they droop and die
And dear, why shouldn't it be
Just so with you and with me

On a bicycle built for two

With silver threads among the gold

Are true to this very day
For he loves her in December
As he did in May

For one comand I stand and wait now

From one who's master of my Fate now

An airline ticket to romantic places

Those stumbling words that told you what my heart meant
A fair ground's painted swings
These foolish things remind me of you

When you did that to me
I knew somehow this had to be
The winds of March that make my heart a dancer
A telephone that rings but who's to answer?
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

First daffodils and long excited cables
And candle lights on little corner tables
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
The park at evening when the bell has sounded
The ""Ile de France"" with all the gulls around it
The beauty that is Spring's
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The sigh of midnight trains in empty stations
Silk stockings thrown aside dance invitations
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

Gardenia perfume ling'ring on a pillow
Wild strawb'ries only seven francs a kilo
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
The smile of Garbo and the scent of roses
The waiters whistling as the last bar closes
The song that Crosby sings
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The scent of smould'ring leaves, the wail of steamers
Two lovers on the street who walk like dreamers
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!

Chills run up and down my spine
Aladdin's lamp is mine
The dream I dreamed was not denied me

Just one look and then I knew
That all I longed for long ago was you

Just one look and then I knew
That all I longed for long ago
Was you",Long Ago and Far Away,2002
Teddy Wilson,"A sunbonnet blue and a yellow straw hat
Shy little he and she
Were declaring love's old story
In the shade of the old apple tree

A sunbonnet blue and a yellow straw hat
Decided to say, ""I do""
So they rode to June and glory
On a bicycle built for two

Hear the past, the song is old
The summer days are through
With silver threads among the gold
They still say, ""I love you""

A sunbonnet blue and a yellow straw hat
Are true to this very day
For he loves her in December
As he did in May

Teddy Wilson,"Every time we say goodbye, I die a little,
Every time we say goodbye, I wonder why a little,
Why the gods above me, who must be in the know.
Think so little of me, they allow you to go.
When you're near, there's such an air of spring about it,
I can hear a lark somewhere, begin to sing about it,
There's no love song finer, but how strange the change from major to minor,
Every time we say goodbye.

I'd had enough of heartbreak
I told myself that I could never fall again

On a bicycle built for two

With silver threads among the gold

Their little kisses are so short and sweet
The lilies nod to the forget-me-nots
When they're departing in their flower pots

Remain to love until they droop and die

Sprung from cages out on Highway 9
Chrome wheeled, fuel injected, and steppin' out over the line 
Oh-oh, baby, this town rips the bones from your back 
It's a death trap, it's a suicide rap 
We gotta get out while we're young 
'Cause tramps like us, baby we were born to run

I want to guard your dreams and visions 
Just wrap your legs 'round these velvet rims 
And strap your hands 'cross my engines 
Together we could break this trap 
We'll run till we drop, baby we'll never go back 
Oh-oh, will you walk with me out on the wire 
'Cause, baby, I'm just a scared and lonely rider 
But I gotta know how it feels 
I want to know if love is wild

Girls comb their hair in rearview mirrors 
And the boys try to look so hard

Kids are huddled on the beach in a mist

In an everlasting kiss
